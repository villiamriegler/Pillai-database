authorisation to Tyruko on  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Not applicable 
2.2.  About the product 
Tyruko (development code PB006) has been developed as a biosimilar to the reference product Tysabri 
(INN natalizumab), a full-length monoclonal antibody of the IgG4 subclass that targets the α4 integrin 
component of adhesion molecules found on lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils.  
PB006 has been developed to have the same IV dosage form, route of administration, dosing regimen 
and  presentation  as  the  EU  reference  product  Tysabri  (hereafter  identified  as  EU-Tysabri).  The 
subcutaneous  presentation  recently  approved  for  Tysabri  is  not  in  the  scope  of  this  marketing 
authorization application for Tyruko. 
The intended indication for Tyruko is the same as for the reference product EU-Tysabri, which is indicated 
for treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). 
Tysabri  is  indicated  as  single  disease  modifying  therapy  (DMT)  in  adults  with  highly  active  relapsing 
remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) for the following patient groups: 
•  Patients with highly active disease despite a full and adequate course of treatment with at least 
one DMT 
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 10/149 
 
 
 
or 
•  Patients with rapidly evolving severe RRMS defined by 2 or more disabling relapses in one year, 
and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing (GdE) lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) or a significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI. 
Tyruko  is  intended  to  be  administered  at  a  fixed  dose  of  300  mg,  infused  IV  over  approximately  one 
hour, every four weeks. 
Mode of action 
Natalizumab is a selective adhesion-molecule inhibitor and binds to the α4-subunit of human integrins, 
which is highly expressed on the surface of all leukocytes, with the exception of neutrophils. Specifically, 
natalizumab binds to the α4β1 integrin, blocking the interaction with its cognate receptor, vascular cell 
adhesion  molecule-1  (VCAM-1),  and  ligands  osteopontin,  and  an  alternatively  spliced  domain  of 
fibronectin, connecting segment-1 (CS-1). Natalizumab also blocks the interaction of α4β7 integrin with 
the mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MadCAM-1). Disruption of these molecular interactions 
prevents transmigration of mononuclear leukocytes across the endothelium into inflamed parenchymal 
tissue. A further mechanism of action of natalizumab may be to suppress ongoing inflammatory reactions 
in  diseased  tissues  by  inhibiting  the  interaction  of  α4-expressing  leukocytes  with  their  ligands  in  the 
extracellular matrix and on parenchymal cells. As such, natalizumab may act to suppress inflammatory 
activity present at the disease site and inhibit further recruitment of immune cells into inflamed tissues. 
In MS, lesions are believed to occur when activated T-lymphocytes cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). 
Leukocyte migration across the BBB involves interaction between adhesion molecules on inflammatory 
cells and endothelial cells of the vessel wall. The interaction between α4β1 and its targets is an important 
component of pathological inflammation in the brain and disruption of these interactions leads to reduced 
inflammation. Under normal conditions, VCAM-1 is not expressed in the brain parenchyma. However, in 
the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines, VCAM-1 is upregulated on endothelial cells and possibly on 
glial cells near the sites of inflammation. In the setting of central nervous system (CNS) inflammation in 
MS, it is the interaction of α4β1 with VCAM-1, CS-1 and osteopontin that mediates the firm adhesion 
and  transmigration  of  leukocytes  into  the  brain  parenchyma  and  may  perpetuate  the  inflammatory 
cascade  in  CNS  tissue.  Blockade  of  the  molecular  interactions  of  α4β1  with  its  targets  reduces 
inflammatory activity present in the brain in MS and inhibits further recruitment of immune cells into 
inflamed tissue, thus reducing the formation or enlargement of MS lesions (Tysabri SmPC, Mar 2022). 
2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development 
The development program comprises 4 clinical studies: 1 pivotal Phase 1 PK/ PD study with PB006, US-
Tysabri, and EU-Tysabri in healthy subjects, 1 pivotal Phase 3 study with PB006 versus EU-Tysabri in 
patients with RRMS, 1 pilot Phase 1 pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) study with EU-Tysabri 
in healthy subjects, and 1 supportive Phase 1 safety study with PB006 in healthy subjects. 
The 3-arm PK/PD study in healthy subjects (PB006-01-03) was 1 of the 2 pivotal studies in the clinical 
program demonstrating similarity of PB006 versus US-Tysabri and EU-Tysabri. This PK/PD study aimed 
to demonstrate PK similarity and included sensitive PD endpoints in order to support the demonstration 
of similar efficacy in this MAA. In addition, the clinical pharmacology data generated for EU-Tysabri and 
US-Tysabri in this study established the scientific bridge between both products. 
The Phase 3 study in RRMS patients (PB006-03-01) was the second pivotal study in the clinical program. 
The  study  aimed  to  show  that  there  were  no  clinically  meaningful  differences  with  regard  to  efficacy, 
immunogenicity and safety between PB006 and EU-Tysabri in the target population.

EMA/359152/2023  
Page 11/149 
 
 
 
Scientific  advice  was  obtained  from  the  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMA)  in  2017,  early  in  the 
development  of  PB006.  In  this  meeting,  the  design  of  the  proposed  clinical  studies  with  PB006  was 
discussed, and main design aspects were aligned with the agency, including: 
•  PK  and  PD  endpoints  in  the  pivotal  PK/PD  study  PB006-01-03  (with  α4-integrin  %  relative 
receptor saturation [%RS] as primary PD endpoint) 
•  Efficacy endpoints in the Phase 3 study PB006-03-01 (with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
activity as primary endpoint and ARR as secondary endpoint) 
The global development program of PB006 was subsequently also discussed with the United States Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) in BPD Type 2 meetings in 2017, 2019 and 2020. 
In the Scientific Advice meeting in 2017, EMA has confirmed that an evaluation of similar clinical efficacy 
based on MRI assessment is required. In contrast, the US FDA will evaluate similarity of efficacy of PB006 
with  the  reference  product  by  means  of  PD  endpoints.  The  EMA  considers  PD  data  as  supportive  for 
evaluation of similarity of efficacy. 
Subsequent to the meeting with the EMA, various design aspects of the clinical studies (e.g., including 
the choice of PD endpoints and their analysis in the pivotal PK/PD study) were discussed with the FDA 
and  adjustments  to  the  study  designs  were  made  to  meet  FDA  requirements.  In  particular,  the  FDA 
requested to include sensitive PD endpoints in the pivotal PK/PD study, which would serve as basis for 
FDA’s assessment of similar efficacy between PB006 and the reference product. In addition, a pilot study 
was requested to enable the selection of sensitive PD endpoints. 
The most relevant adjustments that were implemented into the PB006 clinical program after the initial 
discussion of the program with the EMA in 2017 are outlined in the following. 
Study Tysabri Pilot-01-01: 
•  A pilot study was conducted, to collect PK/PD data with 3 different doses of EU-Tysabri in order 
to  establish  an  appropriately  sensitive  PK/PD  study  setting,  including  the  dose  selection  and 
primary PD endpoints, for the pivotal PK/PD study with PB006. 
Study PB006-01-03: 
•  The primary PD endpoint α4-integrin RS was complemented with baseline-adjusted CD19+ B-
cell counts as a co-primary PD endpoint. 
•  For the primary analysis of α4-integrin RS, AUEC0-12 weeks was chosen. As additional analysis, a 
descriptive analysis of AUEC4-12 weeks was conducted. 
•  For the analysis of co-primary PD endpoints, a pooling approach for both comparators (EU- and 
US-Tysabri)  was  chosen,  due  to  the  high  variability  of  the  CD19+  endpoint.  The  pooling 
approach for the primary analysis (i.e., only one comparison biosimilar candidate vs reference) 
increases the number of subjects in the pooled reference group. 
•  To power the study for a CD19+ PD assessment, the sample size was increased from N=255 
(sample size discussed with EMA in 2017) to N=453 subjects (N=151 per treatment group). 
•  CD34+, VCAM and MAdCAM were selected as secondary PD endpoints. 
Study PB006-03-01: 
A single transition of a subset of RRMS patients (N=30) from treatment with EU-Tysabri after 24 weeks 
to PB006 was implemented on the request of the FDA. Safety and immunogenicity data collected after 
the transition were used to investigate whether the transition from the reference product to the biosimilar 
drug may be associated with any hypersensitivity or increased immunogenicity.

The  key  elements  and  the  design  of  the  clinical  studies  are  considered  to  be  in  line  with  the 
recommendations received from the EMA in 2017. Additional efficacy endpoints included thereafter and 
an increase in sample size further facilitate the assessment of similarity inefficacy between PB006 and 
the reference product. 
Scientific advice on non-clinical issues 
In  the  scientific  advice  procedure  EMA/CHMP/SAWP/224608/2017  the  applicant  asked  for  agreement 
that  no  animal  studies  are  required  to  support  the  assessment  of  biosimilarity  between  PB006  and 
Tysabri. The CHMP accepted this strategy as far as analytical and functional comparability of PB006 and 
EU-Tysabri can  be  demonstrated  in  vitro,  which  is  in  line  with  current  guidance  (guideline  on  Similar 
biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: non-clinical 
and  clinical  issues  (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005  Rev1),  and  the  guideline  on  Similar  biological 
medicinal  products 
containing  monoclonal 
antibodies:  non-clinical 
and 
clinical 
issues 
(EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010)).  
National scientific advice was also provided in 2016. The minipig animal model was accepted as a relevant 
species  for  Natalizumab,  however,  a  pre-clinical  study  in  lieu  of  a  human  PK  study  for  formulation 
bridging was not accepted. It was agreed that no in vivo toxicity studies need to be performed.  
The applicant performed a comparative subchronic repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys, 
including PK analysis, with PB006 and EU-Tysabri 
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) related considerations 
The  pivotal  PK/PD  study  PB006-01-03  and  the  pivotal  confirmatory  Phase  3  study  PB006-03-01  were 
conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the PK/PD study, recruitment was temporarily held from 
March to August 2020 (when around one-third of the subjects had been enrolled) and safety measures 
were implemented to protect subjects from a COVID-19 infection after dosing (e.g., reducing maximum 
subject age to 54 years, including polymerase chain reaction [PCR] tests for severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus type 2 [SARS CoV-2], increasing in-house period from 3 to 8 days and including 
home-quarantine up to Day 14). 
The Phase 3 study in RRMS was (after Data Safety Monitoring Board [DSMB] endorsement) still enrolling 
and treating patients as of March 2020, when COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health 
Organization; the last patient was randomized in May 2020. 
For  study  PB006-03-01,  all  COVID-19  AEs  (according  to  Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities 
[MedDRA] coding) were identified and summarized. In order to assess the impact of COVID-19 on safety 
and efficacy of this study, the following analyses were performed: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Study discontinuations and protocol deviations due to COVID-19 were summarized. 
Demography data for confirmed COVID-19 patients were summarized. 
Protocol deviations due to COVID-19 were summarized by country. 
A  sensitivity  analysis  (for  primary  endpoint)  was  to  be  performed  on  the  pre-  COVID  per 
protocol (PP) population. 
These additional analyses are in line with the guidance from the EMA on the management of clinical trials 
during  the  COVID-19  pandemic  (Guidance  on  the  management  of  clinical  trials  during  the  COVID-19 
pandemic, 2022).

2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Natalizumab,  the  active  substance  contained  in  Tyruko,  also  referred  of  as  PB006,  is  a  recombinant 
humanised  anti-α4-integrin  antibody  produced  in  a  Chinese  Hamster  Ovary  (CHO)  cell  line  by 
recombinant DNA technology. 
Tyruko  was  developed  as  biosimilar  to  the  reference  medicinal  product  (RMP)  Tysabri.  The  finished 
product is presented as sterile, colourless, and clear to slightly opalescent concentrate for solution for 
infusion,  containing  300  mg  of  natalizumab  as  active  substance  (each  vial  contains  15  mL  of 
concentrate).  Other  ingredients  are:  sodium  chloride,  histidine,  histidine  hydrochloride,  monohydrate, 
polysorbate 80 and water for injections. 
It is presented as a 300 mg/15 mL concentrate for solution for infusion in single-use Type I glass vial.  
The product is available in type I borosilicate glass vials with bromobutyl stoppers and aluminium seals 
with a flip-top cap. 
The  subcutaneous  route  of  administration,  which  was  approved  for  Tysabri,  was  not  in  the  scope  of 
Tyruko development. 
2.4.2.  Active substance 
2.4.2.1.  General information 
PB006 is a humanised monoclonal antibody of the IgG4κ subclass consisting of two heavy (HC) and two 
light  chains  (LC),  connected  by  four  inter-chain  disulfide  bonds.  Antibodies  of  the  IgG4  subclass  are 
characterised by a shorter hinge region in comparison to antibodies of the IgG1 subclass, leading to a 
reduced  flexibility  of  the  hinge  region.  As  expected  for  an  IgG4  antibody,  natalizumab  demonstrates 
reduced binding to Fcγ receptors and lack of ability to fix complement in vitro. The molecular weight of 
the intact deglycosylated natalizumab molecule, as measured by mass spectrometry, is 146 kDa. Each 
heavy chain has one N-linked glycosylation site at Asn300. 
As other complex glycoproteins, PB006 displays a natural amount of microheterogeneity in terms of a 
different  degree  of  glycosylation  and  post-translational  modifications  of  amino  acids.  The  C-terminal 
lysine residues of the heavy chains (Lys450) are mostly cleaved by cellular proteases during cell culture 
growth. As other antibodies of the IgG4 class, natalizumab contains 12 intra-chain disulfide bonds. The 
two heavy chains are connected in the hinge region by two inter-chain disulfide bonds and the light chain 
is linked to the heavy chain by an inter-chain disulfide bond. Further details on product variants due to 
common  sources  of  post-translational  and  processing  modifications  of  PB006  were  presented  by  the 
applicant. 
2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacturing process 
The active substance is manufactured at Polpharma Biologics S.A., Ul. Trzy Lipy 3, Gdańsk, Pomorskie 
80-172, Poland. All sites involved in the manufacture and storage of the cell banks and manufacture, 
quality control testing of the active substance operate in accordance with EU GMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 14/149 
 
 
 
PB006 active substance is produced based on a CHO cell line. To manufacture of PB006 active substance, 
a  fed-batch  process  with  preceding  expansion  stages,  followed  by  primary  recovery  and  a  series  of 
purification  steps,  typical  for  monoclonal  antibodies,  including  several  chromatography  steps,  virus 
inactivation,  virus-filtration  and  ultra-/diafiltration  (UDF)  steps  was  established.  Used  media,  critical 
process  parameters  (CPPs),  critical  in-process  controls  (IPCs),  hold  times  and  column  lifetimes  were 
presented. No reprocessing is foreseen for intermediates and PB006 active substance. The manufacturing 
process was sufficiently described. 
Control of materials 
The control of raw materials section was split into an upstream process (USP) and a downstream (DSP) 
part. All raw materials used in USP and DSP are of non-animal and non-human origin, while cell culture 
media are chemically defined and free of animal-derived raw materials. All ingredients are certified as 
BSE/TSE-free. A complete list of all raw materials used for manufacture of PB006 was provided. Non-
compendial  raw  materials  are  tested  against  in-house  specifications,  which  were  disclosed  and  found 
acceptable.  The  qualitative  and  quantitative  composition  of  cell  culture  media  and  feeds  was  not 
provided, and justified by being intellectually protected. The composition of all buffers and media and 
their physico-chemical properties was disclosed. Chromatography resins were listed, including respective 
suppliers. Provided information on compendial and non-compendial raw materials and respective control 
strategy used to manufacture PB006 is acceptable, except cell culture media and supplements used in 
the USP, and purchased from an external supplier. Information about the composition of these media 
was provided, and thus the compliance of respective control strategies is confirmed.  
In relation to cell line development, the applied cloning strategy was explained. Cell line development 
was sufficiently described and is acceptable. 
The procedure for the manufacture of the MCB and WCB was described. Cell line characterisation data 
and IPCs were presented. Genetic stability was assessed, and the nucleotide sequence of the transgene 
was  confirmed  in  the  MCB,  working  cell  bank  (WCB)  and  the  post-production  cell  bank  (PPCB).  Gene 
copy numbers were comparable in the MCB, WCB, PPCB and the end-of -production cell bank (EOPCB), 
and flanking LC and HC nucleotide sequences were confirmed. A limit of in vitro cell age (LIVCA) study 
was performed at manufacturing scale to ensure the genetic stability of the recombinant production cell 
line until the end of production (EOP) with extended number of cell passages, including the demonstration 
of adventitious agents safety (such as viruses and mycoplasma). Taken together, characterisation of cell 
banks was performed by state-of-the-art technologies and found acceptable.   
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The applicant performed a quality attribute criticality assessment. A first criticality assessment evaluation 
was performed at the beginning of the development to identify and classify the criticality of the product 
quality attributes (QAs) to patient safety and drug efficacy. The assessment was later updated to reflect 
additional knowledge as well as health authority feedback/requirements. 
The  applicant  gave  an  overview  of  process  controls  applied  for  the  active  substance  manufacturing 
process. Process parameters and IPCs were split into categories based on their criticality. A list of process 
parameters was provided for the USP and the DSP, and included each step of the manufacturing process. 
IPCs were also listed for the USP and the DSP. Corresponding method applied to assess respective IPC 
was indicated, as well as a short justification of criticality and the acceptable range. Process control and 
IPC lists are complete, and acceptance ranges and limits are tight enough and justified by experimental 
data. Hold times were validated at commercial scale during PPQ runs. Additional analytical procedures 
for controlling critical steps were briefly described. Taken together, safety and efficacy related quality 
attributes were controlled at critical process steps. Presented control strategy is complete and aligned 
with  guidance  documents,  thus  appropriate  for  this  class  of  biologics.  The  applicant  performed  a 
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 15/149 
 
 
 
comprehensive  criticality  assessment  evaluation  of  PB006  quality  attributes  based  on  impact  and 
criticality of respective parameters. A detailed list of CQA’s was presented. The overall risk of each quality 
attribute  was  adjusted,  if  e.g.  multiple  orthogonal  methods  were  applied  to  assess  the  same  quality 
attribute. The evaluation procedure was explained in enough details, scientifically justified and thus is 
acceptable for this molecule. 
Process validation 
Process validation consisted of the assessment of USP and DSP process performance qualification (PPQ) 
runs at commercial scale, dispensing homogeneity of active substance, in-process material hold-time, 
process-related  and  product-related  impurity  clearance,  and  supportive  studies  including  resin  re-use 
and storage studies, extractable- and leachable assessment, transport validation and continued process 
verification.  
All CPP and key process parameter (KPP) remained within proposed ranges for USP validation activities. 
In  addition,  all  IPCs  of  the  USP  process,  as  well  as  all  IPCs  of  media,  feed  and  supplement  solutions 
testing met the pre-defined limits. Deviations that occurred during the USP process were assessed to 
have no adverse impact on process performance or on product quality attributes.  
The  results  obtained  during  the  manufacture  and  analysis  of  the  PPQ  batches  demonstrate  the 
consistency  of  the  downstream  process.  This  provides  confirmation  and  demonstrates  that  the  DSP 
process can consistently provide product of defined quality and in specifications and that the process can 
be considered validated. 
A dispensing homogeneity study was performed in order to demonstrate the capability of the equipment 
and the process to perform homogeneous dispensing of the compounded active substance over the entire 
dispensing  process.  These  parameters  were  shown  to  be  efficient  in  order  to  obtain  homogenous  in-
process material. Evaluation of the results of the samples taken during dispensing demonstrated that 
the PB006 dispensing process has no impact on product quality and consistently delivers a homogenous 
active substance meeting with the specifications. 
Impurity clearance was assessed at respective clearance steps during process validation. Again, all PPQ 
batches  were  analysed  and  confirmed  that  the  downstream  processing  is  able  to  efficiently  and 
reproducibly reduce levels of product-related impurities below specified acceptance limits. 
Resin re-usage studies were performed for chromatography resins and demonstrated no adverse effects 
on process performance and product quality. The absence of protein carryover was also  confirmed at 
manufacturing scale by performing a mock run (resin carry-over).  
A  leachable  and  extractable  assessment  was  performed  for  polymeric  materials  used  during 
manufacturing,  processing  and  storage  of  PB006  active  substance  in  order  to  identify  potential  risks 
caused by material in direct or indirect contact with media, buffers, in-process materials and the active 
substance. No organic compound or element could be released at toxicologically relevant concentrations 
from either process consumable. The applicant’s approach is supported. 
Transportation  validation  was  performed  for  the  temperature  controlled  shipment  of  active  substance 
using  qualified  shipment  containers.  A  transport  simulation  (mechanical  stress,  reduced  air  pressure) 
was carried out in an ISTA lab, using worst case simulations. All requirements as defined in the transport 
validation protocol for PB006 were met, and the applicant’s conclusion that the transportation process is 
considered  validated  is  supported.  After  successful  process  qualification  process  performance  and 
product  quality  are  monitored  as  part  of  the  continued  process  verification  (CPV)  to  ensure  that  the 
manufacturing  process  is  maintained  under  control  throughout  the  commercial  phase.  It  is  a  planned 
lifecycle management program to ensure that the manufacturing process remains in a state of control. 
Assessment report

This is achieved through the systematic collection, analysis, and trending of product related and process 
related data. 
Manufacturing process development 
The overview of PB006 active substance manufacturing process history is presented below. 
After  successful  USP  and  DSP  development,  consolidation  runs  were  performed  and  process 
characterisation  (PC)  studies  defined  process  parameter  criticality  and  its  ranges.  The  process  was 
upscaled to the commercial scale for production of pre-clinical and clinical material, after its robustness 
was confirmed in consolidation runs.  
In the early development program of PB006, a change in cell banks (MCB and WCB) was implemented; 
a comprehensive comparability exercise at active substance level confirmed the comparability of both 
cell banks, and that the finished product manufactured from the initial cell bank is representative for the 
commercial product.  
Early process development activities were initiated, and optimisation of the process was conducted and 
the  final  verification  of  the  optimised  process  was  performed.  The  final  setting  was  confirmed  by 
assessing  several  quality  attributes  using  representative  USP  starting  material.  The  final  process  was 
locked after the manufacture of consolidation runs.  
Process characterisation included a pre-PC risk assessment to assess the process- and product related 
risks  which  might  impact  on  process  performance  and/or  product  quality,  in  order  to  define  process 
parameters  for  further  investigation  during  PC  studies.  Finally,  the  development  of  a  control  strategy 
including justifications for IPC classifications was achieved. The representativeness of the initial WCB for 
the USP PC characterisation studies has been also confirmed. Resin reuse studies were performed using 
a representative down-scaled model. 
The  development  of  the  manufacturing  process  and  the  process  characterisation  were  well  and 
comprehensively described. Development activities were performed according to guidance documents, 
including  comparability  exercises  when  critical  changes  were  implemented  into  the  manufacturing 
process.  The  provenience  and  the  use  of  each  development  batch  is  clearly  indicated.  The  control 
strategy  is  considered  state-of-the-art,  and  was  based  on  an  in  depth  understanding  of  each  process 
step, supported by intense and well-coordinated development activities. This part of the dossier is found 
acceptable. 
Characterisation 
Elucidation of structure 
PB006 active substance was thoroughly characterised on the physicochemical/biophysical level and at 
the  level  of  in  vitro  functional  activity  using  a  broad  panel  of  analytical  procedures  to  investigate  all 
relevant  quality  attributes.  The  applied  method  panel  included  orthogonal  analytical  methods  for  in-
depth  analysis  of  higher  order  structures,  size  and  charge  variants  and  the  assessment  of  functional 
properties of natalizumab.  
Taken together, proposed methodological portfolio consists of a broad spectrum of orthogonal and state 
of the art methods, which enable an in-depth assessment of the active compound. All applied methods 
were validated, qualified or at least classified as suitable for the intended use. On top of the in-depth 
assessment  of  the  active  compound,  charge-variants  and  hydrophobic-variants  were  isolated,  and 
assessed  for  their  specific  physico-chemical  properties.  Taken  together,  PB006  active  substance  was 
sufficiently characterised and respective part of the dossier is considered acceptable.

Impurities 
Clearance  of  the  most  important  product-related  impurities  was  sufficiently  addressed  in  the  PB006 
active substance process validation chapter. It is agreed that no further evaluation of product related 
impurities is required. 
Respective studies demonstrated that the downstream process is able to consistently reduce levels of 
process-related impurities to meet the limits of the PB006 active substance specification.  
Qualitative and quantitative studies were conducted to analyse the extractable profiles and is acceptable 
for  the  most  important  consumables  used  to  manufacture  PB006  active  substance.  Overall,  the 
conclusion that it is highly unlikely that an identified or unidentified extractable or leachable chemical 
from the process equipment may affect the biological safety of PB006 is agreed. 
An extractables study performed on the container closure system for PB006 finished product is assessed 
in the finished product section. 
2.4.2.3.  Specification 
Specifications 
The active substance release and shelf life specifications include control of identity, purity and impurities, 
potency and other general tests. 
The proposed battery of assays to control PB006 CQAs is composed of orthogonal and state-of-the-art 
methods.   
Overall, the active substance release and shelf life specifications are considered acceptable. 
Analytical procedures 
Analytical procedures used to control PB006 active substance were described.  
Validation of non-compendial methods was carried out according to ICH Q2(R1) guideline. All predefined 
acceptance criteria were met, and thus proposed methods are considered valid within their respective 
ranges. Compendial methods were qualified for their intended use, but respective qualification protocols 
were  not  submitted.  Thus  the  applicant  justified  the  performance  in  sample  matrix  of  compendial 
methods used to assess bioburden and bacterial endotoxins.  
Batch analysis 
The applicant presented batch analysis data from manufacturing scale batches. They confirm that the 
established  manufacturing  process  is  able  to  deliver  PB006  active  substance  with  a  consistent  and 
predefined  quality  profile,  and  the  proposed  control  strategy  besides  minor  adaptations  of  specified 
acceptance limits is acceptable. 
Reference Standard  
The  development  reference  standards  were  prepared  for  characterisation,  qualification  and  routine 
testing until preparation of the Interim Reference Standard. The Interim Reference Standard was further 
qualified  as  Primary  Reference  Standard  (PRS)  prior  to  the  first  Working  Reference  Standard  (WRS), 
which are the two reference standards currently in use. After establishing the PRS, any subsequent WRS 
will be calibrated against it (two-tiered approach). Based on the re-test results, storage conditions have 
been confirmed. WRSs will be used for the future routine testing of PB006 active substance and finished 
product batches and will be characterised against the PRS.  
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 18/149 
 
 
 
Development,  primary  and  working  reference  standards  have  been  adequately  bridged  via  potency 
assays. The reference standard control strategy is properly described.   
Container closure system 
The container closure system for PB006 active substance is composed of a PET bottle and a high-density 
polyethylene (HDPE) screw cap. An appropriate description of the container closure has been provided.  
In  summary,  the  proposed  container  closure  system  is  justified  for  storing  PB006  active  substance 
regarding  stability,  integrity  and  compatibility  of  the  medicinal  product.  All  materials  of  the  container 
closure  system  are  described  in  the  Ph.  Eur.  and  their  qualitative  composition  is  determined  by  the 
supplier. Absence of interaction studies has been properly justified and a representative supplier product 
certificate has been provided. 
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
The applicant initially claimed a 36-month shelf life (5 ± 3ºC). 
The stability of PB006 active substance was performed at long term storage (5 ± 3ºC), accelerated (25 
±  2°C  /  60  ±  5%  R.H.)  and  stressed  (40  ±  2°C  /  75  ±  5%  R.H.)  conditions.  Accelerated  and  stress 
stability studies were performed to confirm the PB006 active substance stability-indicating profile, and 
provided assurance that changes in the purity and potency are detected. Stability studies of PB006 active 
substance were designed in accordance with guidance documents ICH Q5C and ICH Q1A(R2), considering 
testing frequency, storage conditions, representativeness of batches, container closure system and the 
applied methodological portfolio.  
The shelf-life of PB006 active substance was determined at long term conditions based on the totality of 
available  real-time  stability  data.  All  test  parameters  remained  within  the  pre-defined  shelf-life 
specifications for all available pull-points. Stability studies will be pursued, and data provided according 
to the post-approval stability commitment.  
Data and graphical representations from accelerated and stress stability studies were presented.  
Taken together, design of stability studies, choice of stability batches and proposed shelf-life specification 
is appropriate.  
Overall, taking into account the totality of the data submitted by the applicant, the proposed shelf-life 
for the active substance is acceptable. 
The  applicant  committed  to  finalise  ongoing  stability  studies  to  confirm  proposed  shelf-life  of  PB006 
active substance at long-term storage conditions, and to place on stability at least one commercial batch 
each calendar year, as long as production occurs during the respective calendar year. Stability-indicating 
parameters will be studied, while the assessment of quality attributes which have shown to be unaffected 
in  presented  stability  programs  will  be  omitted.  In  case  of  any  confirmed  OOS  result  or  unexpected 
stability  issue,  the  applicant  will  inform  the  agency  and  propose  appropriate  corrective  actions.  The 
proposed post-approval stability commitment is acceptable. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
PB006 finished product is a sterile, colourless, and clear to slightly opalescent concentrate for solution 
for infusion, presented in Type I borosilicate glass vials not siliconised, with bromobutyl stoppers and 
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 19/149 
 
 
 
aluminium seals with a flip-off cap. No overage is required. The nominal fill volume of PB006 finished 
product  is  15  mL  per  vial.  Each  vial  contains  an  appropriate  excess  volume  (overfill)  that  allows 
withdrawal of the labelled amount of the finished product from the vial.  
The finished product is formulated with sodium chloride, histidine, histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, 
polysorbate 80 and water for injections. All excipients are widely used in the manufacturing of parenteral 
pharmaceutical preparations and, comply with the Ph. Eur. Certificate of analyses for all four excipients 
are provided. The finished product does not contain any novel excipients or any excipients of human or 
animal origin. 
The procedure followed to determine the overfill volume is described and results have been provided.  
Characterisation  studies  covering  physicochemical  and  biological  properties  of  natalizumab  were 
performed  using  PB006  active  substance  as  well  as  PB006  finished  product  (for  selected  quality 
attributes). An overview of the QTPP of PB006 is presented. In order to define the acceptable ranges for 
the quality attributes (QA) of the proposed biosimilar, the range and variability of the reference product 
was evaluated using multiple batches of Tysabri. CQAs were identified by the risk assessment performed 
in accordance with ICH Q9. The criticality of each quality attribute is defined by combining the impact 
and uncertainty assessments according to the concepts discussed in the dossier. 
The  PB006  finished  product  manufacturing  process  employs  standard  methods  for  production  of 
parenteral products that cannot be terminally sterilised. PB006 is a concentrate for solution for infusion 
which is manufactured by sterile filtration and subsequent aseptic filling. PB006 active  substance and 
PB006 finished product have the same qualitative composition and no compounding is performed in the 
PB006 finished product manufacturing process. The same process was used for manufacturing of finished 
product during clinical trials. 
Changes in the manufacturing process have been properly described. PB006 finished product used for 
non-clinical  studies  was  manufactured  at  the  initial  manufacturing  site.  Afterwards,  the  clinical 
manufacturing  process  was  established  at  the  commercial  manufacturing  site.  Differences  introduced 
into the PB006 finished product manufacturing process are related to the change of the manufacturing 
site. 
Comparability between pre-clinical and clinical manufacturing processes has been confirmed by available 
batch release data and stability data. No differences in the degradation rates and profiles were observed 
between the pre-clinical and clinical batches.    
Based  on  the  change  of  the  manufacturing  site  and  the  additional  experience  gained  during  PB006 
finished product manufacturing, adjustments for some of the manufacturing steps were introduced to 
optimise  the  process  for  the  commercial  manufacturing.  Based  on  the  results  gathered  during  the 
development studies and the increased product knowledge, a failure mode effect analysis (FMEA) risk 
assessment of the PB006 finished product manufacturing process was conducted prior to PPQ campaign 
to define a product control strategy and process action limits. Selection of the PB006 finished product 
primary packaging for clinical trials was based on the outcome of the reverse engineering evaluation of 
the RMP Tysabri. Extractable studies  were not performed on the glass vials, which are non-polymeric 
and  widely  used  for  pharmaceutical  drugs,  and  are  considered  to  be  of  low  risk  and  not  requiring 
evaluation  for  extractable.  The  discussion  on  the  toxicological  evaluation  and  the  final  outcome  have 
been provided.  
The  applicant  explained  that  a  change  of  the  vial  became  necessary,  due  to  a  decision  of  the 
manufacturer to discontinue production of the vial chosen for clinical batches of PB006. An alternative 
manufacturer  was  selected,  and  implemented  prior  to  finished  product  process  validation  for  future 
commercial  production.  Comparability  to  the  previously  used  vial  was  assessed.  Studies  performed 
confirmed  the  suitability  of  the  vials  used  in  commercial  production.  Microbiological  quality  of  the 
Assessment report

container closure system selected was confirmed. The applicant performed in-use compatibility studies 
to  ensure  physicochemical  compatibility  of  PB006  finished  product  with  the  clinical  administration 
materials at various stages of product development A detailed justification for the low risk classification 
and the omission of shear force stress degradation studies have been provided. The in-use compatibility 
of PB006 finished product with clinical administration items was successfully proved. 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacturing process 
Manufacturing of the finished product, including primary and secondary packaging and quality control 
and release testing facilities are listed in the dossier. All sites are compliant with EU GMP.  
PB006 finished product and active substance have the same qualitative and quantitative composition.  
PB006 finished product is manufactured according to a standard manufacturing process which includes 
pooling  of  active  substance,  bioburden  reduction  filtration,  sterile  filtration,  filling  and  stoppering, 
crimping, visual inspection, storage and final packaging. A flow chart of the manufacturing process which 
include all process steps, CPPs and critical IPCs is presented. The steps are properly described. The batch 
number system is described. Established hold times have been validated and described. 
Process controls 
The  overall  control  strategy  presented  includes  definition  of  process  parameters  and  IPCs.  Process 
parameters have been classified in CPPs, KPPs and non-KPP. Any excursion outside of the established 
acceptable ranges during the GMP production is investigated and the possible impact on quality will be 
assessed according to the site internal procedures. Definition of IPCs has been done according to ICH 
guidelines. For the control of output parameters whose variability has the potential to affect a CQA in 
the final product (critical IPC), an acceptance criterion or an action limit is defined, and  optionally an 
additional alert limit. Definition of process parameters and IPCs has been properly described. The control 
strategy  presented  is  appropriate  to  ensure  adequate  product  quality  and  manufacturing  process 
consistency.  
Process validation 
To ensure that the process is consistent and robust, several activities have been conducted throughout 
the process design and process qualification (PQ) stages. A pre-PPQ risk assessment has been performed 
ahead of process validation according to FMEA. Validation of the manufacturing process has been done 
with  three  consecutive  batches  manufactured  according  to  the  PPQ  protocol,  from  active  substance 
batches  fully  representative.  Test  procedures  applied  to  process  validation  samples  and  results  from 
analytical method validation are discussed. Validation of PB006 finished product manufacturing process 
is discussed. The validation strategy is properly described and considered acceptable.  
The  membrane  filters  used  for  bioburden  reduction  and  subsequent  sterilising  filtration  of  active 
substance  are  sterilised,  and  respective  qualification  reports  were  provided.  Filters  have  been 
validatedFilter  validation  has  been  performed  according  to  EMA  Guideline  on  “the  sterilisation  of  the 
medicinal 
product, 
active 
substance, 
excipient 
and 
primary 
container” 
(EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/850374/2015). Validation of the aseptic filling process in the sterile area of the 
finished product manufacturing facilities was initially performed with three consecutive successful media 
fills and is periodically re-validated by media fills.  
The  suitability  in  terms  of  safety  of  the  polymeric  process  contact  materials  that  are  used  during  the 
finished  product  manufacturing  process  has  been  evaluated.  Mandatory  E&L  studies  for  the  primary 
packaging and the final filter of the finished product were performed. The summary reports for the PB006

active substance and finished product elemental impurity risk assessment and for the elemental impurity 
clearance  study  have  been  provided.  Vials  are  washed,  depyrogenated  and  sterilised.  The  validation 
process for the depyrogenation step and vial washing step are reported. Rubber stoppers are pre-washed 
and sterilised. Validation of rubber sterilisation is reported.   
Process performance and product quality will be monitored as part of the continued process verification 
(CPV) to ensure that the manufacturing process is maintained under control throughout the commercial 
phase. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
Specifications 
The  finished  product  release  and  shelf-life  specifications  include  test  methods  for  physical  state, 
coloration,  clarity,  subvisible  particles,  visible  particles,  osmolality,  extractable  volume,  pH,  excipient 
concentration, identity, purity, sterility, bacterial endotoxins, content and biological activity (potency). 
The  quality  attributes  selected  for  release  and  stability  of  PB006  finished  product  are  considered 
adequate  and 
in 
line  with 
the  guidelines 
ICH  Q6B,  EMA/CHMP/BWP/532517/2008  and 
EMEA/CHMP/BWP/157653/2007.  Related  analytical  tests  are  acceptable.  For  compendial  methods  the 
respective references to Ph. Eur. and USP are included.  
Acceptance criteria for PB006 finished product release and stability testing, as well as limits for PB006 
in-process testing, were set based on the available data from PB006 finished product batches, and PB006 
finished product stability studies.  
Overall, the finished product release and shelf life specifications are considered acceptable. 
Analytical procedures 
For methods identical to the active substance testing, the applicant refers to the corresponding active 
substance sections.  
For  compendial  methods,  the  applicant  refers  to  the  corresponding  Ph.  Eur.  Monographs.  Non-
compendial  tests  have  been  validated  according  to  ICH  Q2(R1)  and  a  validation  report  for  the 
instrumental method has been provided. Verification reports for the compendial microbiological methods 
are presented.  
Characterisation of impurities 
A risk analysis in accordance with ICH Q3D guideline was performed to evaluate the potential presence 
of  elemental  impurities  in  PB006,  covering  raw  materials,  excipients,  manufacturing  equipment  and 
utilities as possible sources of elemental impurities. Mentioned strategy and the applicant’s conclusion 
that no additional control measures are required is acceptable.  
A nitrosamine risk assessment was performed and considered raw materials, single use materials and 
manufacturing  process  conditions  used  to  manufacture  PB006  active  substance.  Respective  summary 
report was provided, and the conclusion that there is no risk of presence of nitrosamine impurities in the 
PB006 active substance is supported. 
Batch analysis 
Results  of  all  batch  analyses  are  presented.  The  history  of  release  and  shelf-life  specifications  and 
procedures and changes for analyses of commercial processes are presented. Batch to batch consistency 
has been confirmed among all batches tested  
Assessment report

Container closure system 
The container closure system is a clear Type 1 non-siliconised glass vial, closed with a 20 mm bromobutyl 
rubber  stopper  coated  with  fluoropolymer,  and  crimped  with  20  mm  flip-top  aluminium  seal  caps). 
Technical drawings of stopper and vial, with critical dimensions, are provided. The secondary packaging 
system  is  described.  Specifications  for  vial  and  stopper  have  been  provided.  Compliance  to  Ph. 
Eur./pharmacopoeia is stated. Compliance status of the cap is not applicable since it is not in contact 
with the product, which is acceptable. Suitability of the container closure system for storage has been 
confirmed.  Risk  assessment  has  been  conducted  on  all  materials  in  contact  with  product. 
Extractable/leachable studies have been performed only on the rubber stopper. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
The  applicant  proposed  a  shelf-life  of  36  months  at  2  to  8°C  for  the  undiluted  product  and  an  in-use 
storage up to 24 hours at 2 to 8°C for the diluted product.  
The shelf-life claim is based on available data from stability studies performed in accordance with to the 
guidelines  ICH  Q5C  and  Q1A.  Stability  was  tested  at  long-term  condition  (5  ±  3ºC  for  48  months), 
accelerated condition (5 ± 2°C / 60 ± 5% R.H. for 6 months) and stress condition (40 ± 2°C / 75 ± 5% 
R.H. for 6 months).  
The applicant included batches manufactured according to the commercial process, batches of different 
age  and  batches  derived  from  different  active  substance  batches.  Samples  were  stored  in  an  upright 
(intended storage condition only) and inverted position, protected from light.  
Results show that all batches remained within the shelf-life specifications after storage at the intended 
condition  of  5  ±  3ºC.  Significant  changes  are  observed  when  samples  are  stored  at  40  ±2°C  /  75±5 
%RH: Since no significant differences in stability behaviour were observed between the batches tested, 
the applicant claimed a shelf-life of 36 months, based on a minimum of 3 batches with the longest real 
time stability data.  
Photostability  was  assessed  in  accordance  to  the  guideline  ICH  Q1B.  Studies  confirmed  that  PB006 
finished  product  is  light  sensitive  and  should  be  protected  from  light  in  the  secondary  packaging 
cardboard box. Exposure to stress conditions like oxidation, freeze-thaw, low pH and mechanical stress 
has been tested within the biosimilarity analytical assessment.  
Overall, the acceptable shelf-life for the finished product in unopened vial is 3 years when stored at 2°C  
to 8°C protected from light. 
From a microbiological point of view, after dilution with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for 
injection, immediate use is recommended. If not used immediately, the diluted solution must be stored 
at 2°C to 8°C and infused within 24 hours of dilution. In-use storage times and conditions prior to use 
are the responsibility of the user. 
2.4.3.5.  Biosimilarity 
The  applicant  has  conducted  an  extensive  comparative  analytical  assessment  of  PB006  and  Tysabri, 
addressing more than 40 quality attributes to demonstrate that PB006 is identical to the EU approved 
RMP in amino acid sequence and similar in physicochemical and functional tests, using a broad panel of 
sensitive and orthogonal analytical methods. 
Analytical similarity of PB006 was assessed in a comprehensive analytical similarity exercise using EU-
sourced  Tysabri  RMP.  The  clinical  study  (PB006-01-03)  was  conducted  with  US-Tysabri  and  thus,  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 23/149 
 
 
 
applicant performed a three-way analytical similarity assessment between PB006, EU-Tysabri, and US-
Tysabri. The biosimilarity exercise includes the comparison of physicochemical, biophysical and in vitro 
functional properties, forced degradation studies and stability studies under long-term, accelerated and 
stress conditions. Tables and figures summarising the individual results and data distribution for each 
parameter, chromatograms, spectra, dose-response curves etc. have been included. The presentation 
of data was well structured and of high quality. 
An  in-depth  analysis  of  the  RMP  and  the  biosimilar  as  well  as  prior  knowledge  was  the  base  for 
establishment  of  the  QTPP.  Each  quality  attribute  identified  was  classified  according  to  the  risk  to 
potentially  have  an  impact  on  activity/efficacy,  pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics  (PK/PD), 
immunogenicity and safety as well as the uncertainty of the impact. Similarity was primarily concluded 
from min-max ranges obtained from EU-Tysabri, pre-defined quality ranges (QRs) were considered as 
secondary criterion. QR is defined as QR = (μR – KσR, μR + KσR) where μR is the sample mean, σR is 
the sample standard deviation based on reference product lots, and the multiplier K (in principle, the 
higher the risk category, the lower the multiplier).  Overall, the critical quality attributes assessment was 
well described and in the main the outcome of the risk assignment appears reasonable.  
The  analytical  similarity  study  includes  PB006  (natalizumab)  data  from  finished  product  batches 
manufactured  at  full  commercial  scale.  Biosimilarity  was  evaluated  against  an  appropriate  number  of 
batches of the reference medicinal product, EU-approved Tysabri. A reduced but appropriate number of 
batches has been used for primary structure analysis by LC-MS as well as for ADCC, CDC, ADCP, binding 
to FcγR and C1q methods. US-sourced Tysabri products have been used in the clinical study (PB006-01-
03). Therefore, US-Tysabri batches have additionally been included in the analytical similarity analyses. 
A bridging report of EU-approved and US-licensed Tysabri has been provided by the applicant. 
Ages of the PB006 and Tysabri batches at the time of analytical testing vary within the expiry date. The 
batches  seem  to  reflect  a  range  of  expiration  dates  and  product  ages.  Justification  for  the  statistical 
approaches were provided, and these are considered acceptable as supportive evidence of biosimilarity. 
As  presented  by  the  applicant,  all  the  assays  used  in  the  biosimilarity  study  are  demonstrated  to  be 
suitable for their intended purpose and are either qualified, validated, fit for purpose or are compendial 
methods.  The  chosen  methods  are  considered  standard  methods  that  are  state-of-the-art  and  are 
suitable  to  characterise  and  compare  relevant  structural  and  functional  features  of  the  natalizumab 
finished product in comparison to the RMP. Analytical methods cover primary and higher order structure, 
potency/binding and Fab arm exchange kinetics as well as purity and product related variants. For each 
parameter under investigation, the methodology and performance of the analyses were well described, 
batches  used  and  experimental  data  derived  were  well  presented  including  raw  data  or 
chromatograms/spectra where applicable.  
Similarity between PB006 and Tysabri 
For  many  quality  attributes,  PB006  was  demonstrated  to  be  analytically  highly  similar  to  EU-Tysabri. 
Observed differences are adequately addressed by the applicant and are not expected to impact clinical 
performance of the product. In addition, analytical comparability of US-Tysabri to EU-Tysabri has been 
sufficiently demonstrated as presented in a separate bridging report. 
Primary and higher order structure 
Primary structure of PB006 was characterised for amino acid sequence by peptide mapping with 100% 
confirmation of the sequence. Intact deglycosylated protein, heavy chain deglycosylated and light chain 
masses  of  PB006  and  RMP  were  demonstrated  to  be  similar  to  that  of  theoretical  masses.  The  same 
locations  of  posttranslational  modifications  (N-terminal  pyroglutamic  acid,  oxidation,  deamidation,  N-
glycosylation) have been detected in peptide mapping MS analyses of PB006 and Tysabri samples.  
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 24/149 
 
 
 
Higher  order  structure  was  characterised  for  secondary  and  tertiary  structure.  The  spectra  of  higher 
order structures are similar between PB006 and the RMP and, minor differences in the overall secondary 
structure  are  not  considered  impactful  as  the  region  impacted  does  not  show  strong  straightforward 
correlation to the secondary structure of the protein. 
Fab-arm exchange kinetics 
Fab-arm exchange kinetics, a process typical for IgG4 molecules has been characterized using FRET in 
reducing and physiological (serum) mimicking conditions as suggested within an EMA-SA. The exchange 
of half-molecules of PB006 was within min-max ranges set by the EU-RMP under both conditions and are 
thus regarded as similar. 
Functional characterisation 
Natalizumab  is  binding  to  the  α4-subunit  of  α4β1  and  α4β7  integrins  expressed  on  the  surface  of  all 
leukocytes  except  neutrophils  inhibiting  the  α4-mediated  adhesion  of  leukocytes  to  their  counter-
receptor(s) vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and mucosal adressin cell adhesion molecule-
1  (MAdCAM-1).  The  main  mechanism  of  action  (MoA)  was  evaluated  by  an  ELISA  method  and  SPR. 
Analysing binding to α4β1 and α4β7 by ELISA, relative potency values of PB006 batches were comparable 
to EU-Tysabri and US batches. Orthogonal SPR analyses showed similar relative potencies and measured 
binding  affinities  constants  between  compared  PB006,  EU-Tysabri  and  US-Tysabri  batches.  In  turn, 
inhibition of interaction between VCAM-1 and α4 integrin evaluating the MoA, was demonstrated by three 
potency  methods,  relevant  cell-based  assays  included,  and  the  results  were  comparable.  Highly 
comparable  results  have  been  provided  for  the  inhibition  of  interaction  between  MAdCAM-1  and  α4 
integrin.  As  natalizumab  does  not  exert  Fc-effector  functions,  the  absence  of  such  functions  was 
demonstrated for all three products.  
Limited Fcγ receptor binding could be demonstrated for PB006, EU-RMP and US-Tysabri targeting various 
Fcγ  receptor  isoforms.  In  comparison  to  a  positive  control  C1q  activity  by  natalizumab  could  not  be 
shown. Binding of natalizumab to FcRn was shown to have comparable relative potencies and binding 
affinity constants.  
Although  individual  outliers  have  been  detected,  it  is  agreed  that  biosimilarity  regarding  biological 
functionality was demonstrated. 
Molecular heterogeneity 
Molecular heterogeneity was characterised for size, charge heterogeneity and N-glycosylation. Results 
indicated similar structural, size, and charge heterogeneity between PB006 and the RMP Tysabri. 
Size heterogeneity was assessed by multiple orthogonal, state-of-art methods and comparable profiles 
and chromatograms/electropherograms were observed indicating similarity. The size variants and their 
levels are similar. A larger non-glycosylated heavy chain (NG-HC) peak was observed in EU/US-Tysabri 
samples in comparison to PB006. However, this is a desirable effect and indicates consistent high degree 
glycosylation using CHO host cell (vs murine cells used for Tysabri). Antibody fragments in PB006 are 
low and similar to EU/US-Tysabri. 
Free thiols and correct disulphide bridging were analysed with higher free amounts of SH groups detected 
for PB006 in comparison to EU and US-Tysabri. The same trend is detected by analyses of non-reduced 
peptides. The applicant argues that differences detected are small and related to the semi-quantitative 
method variability. As no effect on relative potency and higher order structure could be detected, the 
conclusion is followed that there is only low risk to be clinically meaningful. Further, neither thioether 
bonds nor incorrectly bound disulphide bonds were detected.

Charge heterogeneity was verified. Overall PB006 and Tysabri were found to be similar in terms of charge 
heterogeneity with the exception of a basic peak at approximately 30 min elution time detected in Tysabri 
batches.  Consequently,  higher  main  charge  variants  for  PB006  and  lower  basic  variants  have  been 
reported in comparison to EU-Tysabri. The applicant investigated the basic fragment of the signal peptide 
present in Tysabri samples in detail. Acidic variant levels were found to be highly similar in PB006 batches   
as  compared  to  EU-approved  Tysabri.  Deamidation  occurs  at  very  low  levels  and  no  major  sites  of 
deamidation have been found within CDR and non-CDR regions of natalizumab. No concern is raised for 
slight differences shown between PB006 and the RMP. 
Levels  of  isoaspartic  acid  and  glycation  were  shown  to  be  comparable.  N-terminal  sequence 
heterogeneity shows almost 100% conversion of N-terminal glutamine to pyroglutamate for all analysed 
natalizumab  samples. An incompletely  processed signal peptide  was detected in EU/US-Tysabri which 
seems to  be  cell line specific. Absence in PB006 is  considered  beneficial. No  differences  in C-terminal 
lysine  formation  were  determined  between  PB006  and  the  RMP.  C-terminal  leucine  (L445)  amidation 
however  is  reported  for  PB006  at  very  low  levels  whereas  this  posttranslational  modification  is  not 
present in Tysabri (murine host cell). Amidation is not considered unnatural, thus no clinical impact is 
expected. 
Low oxidation levels of methionine residues analysed by multiple orthogonal methods observed in PB006 
and EU/US-Tysabri were reported. Major oxidation sites are HC M255 and HC M431 both located at the 
constant region of the antibody. M255 showed higher oxidation levels in PB006 when compared to EU-
Tysabri. However, as shown in the functional assessment section, potency was found to be highly similar 
and FcRn binding was not affected by Met oxidation in the constant domain. Slightly higher oxidation 
levels for PB006 were obtained by other applied analytical methods, which correlates with the presented 
site-specific results. The hydrophobic variants analyses showed higher results for PB006 in comparison 
to  the  EU/US-Tysabri  samples,  correlating  with  results  from  the  above  discussed  C-terminal  leucine 
amidation. It was concluded by the applicant that the hydrophobic variants did not impact protein folding 
(data from higher order structures assays) and had no influence on protein potency. Corresponding data 
have been provided.  
N-glycosylation was characterized for site occupancy by panel of orthogonal methods. N-glycosylation 
site occupancy was identified at EEQFN(300)STYR peptide with slightly higher results in comparison to 
EU/US-Tysabri samples. Similar results were provided by other orthogonal analyses. Comparable glycan 
profiles with minor differences in N-glycans present were shown. While the following N-glycan groups 
could  be  detected  (main,  high  mannose,  afucosylated,  sialylated  and  galactosylated  glycans),  the 
immunogenic  α(1,3)-galactosylation  could  not  be  identified  in  PB006  natalizumab  samples  analysed. 
Differences reported include higher values for galactosylated, afucosylated and high mannose N-glycans 
as well as lower values for main glycan and sialylated glycan species for PB006 samples in comparison 
to EU/US-Tysabri. However, all reported values are within min-max and/or QR ranges of EU-Tysabri. 
Finished product attributes 
Protein  concentration  was  calculated  using  the  experimentally  determined  extinction  coefficient.  The 
applicant provided experimentally determined absorbance coefficients for PB006 and EU-RMP. Measured 
UV 280 concentration values were used for all PB006 batches and for the majority of EU-approved Tysabri 
batches during the biosimilarity studies. The limited use of nominal concentration values for Tysabri does 
not  affect  the  similarity  claim.  A  justification  has  been  provided.  Clinical  doses  in  the  Phase  1  PK/PD 
study  were  calculated  based  on  the  truly  measured  antibody  concentration,  instead  of  the  labelled 
concentration. 
Overall, at the quality level similarity between PB006 and EU-sourced Tysabri could be demonstrated for 
most quality attributes in a comprehensive analytical similarity exercise. Comparability between EU- and 
US-sourced  Tysabri,  which  was  used as  comparator  in  the  clinical  trial,  could  be  demonstrated  in  the 
Assessment report

analytical similarity exercise. The uncertainties concerning differences observed in some parameters of 
PB006 in comparison to the RMP and issues regarding missing information are considered resolved.

The applicant presented a detailed dataset from long-term (5 ± 3°C up to 6 months), accelerated (25 ± 
2°C/60 ± 5% R.H. up to 6 months) and stress (40 ± 2°C/75 ± 5% R.H. up to 6 months) stability studies 
as  well  as  forced  degradation  studies  (multiple  stress  conditions),  in  order  to  establish  degradation 
profiles and to provide a direct stability comparison of PB006 and Tysabri. 
No significant differences were observed under long-term and accelerated storage conditions up to and 
including the 6-month timepoint. Minor differences have been observed for stressed samples between 
PB006 and Tysabri, however no clinically meaningful impact is expected. 
Bridging data of EU-approved and US-licensed Tysabri 
An analytical bridging report has been provided between EU-approved Tysabri and US-licensed Tysabri 
for supporting the conclusions drawn from the PB006 clinical studies. The report consists of data from 
establishment of QTPP ranges. Although minor differences were detected, it is agreed that the analytical 
bridge  is  established  with  regards  to  identity  and  structure,  potency  and  binding,  product-related 
variants, strength and composition as well as degradation pathways and degradation kinetics. 
Overall,  taking  into  account  the  totality  of  the  data  provided,  biosimilarity  of  Tyruko  with  Tysabri  is 
considered demonstrated from a quality point of view. 
2.4.3.6.  Adventitious agents 
Viral clearance studies were performed according to guidance documents. It is agreed that the PB006 
active substance purification process provides sufficient capacity for virus clearance.  
Process  characterisation  and validation studies were performed using scale  down models, which were 
established for each step of the PB006 active substance manufacturing process. Enough details on each 
model were given, and the representativeness of each single manufacturing step was studied based on 
representative  material.  Results  confirmed  that  down-scaled  models  for  all  manufacturing  steps  were 
suitable  and  representative  of  the  manufacturing  scale  behaviour  for  the  measured  attributes,  and 
therefore suitable for use in process characterisation and validation studies. Virus validation studies were 
performed  with  the  same  down  scaled  models  as  described  in  Section  3.2.R  Scale  Down  Model 
Qualification Active substance. 
Viral safety in relation to starting materials as well as virus validation were sufficiently addressed and 
depicted in the dossier, and the applicant's strategy is considered acceptable. 
The documentation provided by the applicant confirms that active substance and finished product pose 
negligible risk for transmission of TSE and BSE and in relation to mycoplasma. 
In summary, the adventitious agents safety evaluation is considered acceptable. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Active substance 
The applicant has developed PB006 as biosimilar to EU approved Tysabri (RMP), and submitted a well 
written quality part of the dossier. In brief, the QTPP of the biosimilar was designed based on the RMP, 
which formed the basis for all further development steps. Critical quality attributes were defined based 
on a risk assessment in combination with a comprehensive assessment of the active compound, based 
on  a  portfolio  of  validated  or  at  least  qualified  orthogonal,  and  state-of-the-art  methods.  The 
manufacturing process and respective control strategy were developed based on the QTPP and identified 
CQAs,  and  validated.  Active  substance  specification  in  combination  with  the  manufacturing  process 
control  strategy  covers  all  relevant  quality  attributes  of  PB006,  and  thus  the  manufacturing  process 
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 29/149 
 
 
 
supplies  the  active  substance  at  consistent  and  acceptable  quality.  Batches  used  for  preclinical  and 
clinical development were representative for the commercial manufacturing process, and stability data 
support the claimed active substance shelf-life of up to 24 months at long term storage conditions (5 ± 
3ºC). 
Finished product 
Tyruko  is  manufactured  according  to  a  standard  manufacturing  process.  No  further  changes  to  the 
formulation are introduced within the manufacturing process of PB006 finished product. All process steps, 
CPPs and critical IPCs are discussed.  
Pharmaceutical  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  finished  product  have  been  properly 
described.  The  results  presented  indicate  consistency  and  uniformity  of  important  product  quality 
characteristics.  The  control  strategy 
is  sufficient 
to  guarantee  consistent/  satisfactory 
quality/performance of the product.  
The proposed shelf life of 36 months when stored at the intended storage condition (2-8 °C, protected 
from light) is supported by appropriate data.  
Biosimilarity 
Overall,  at  the  quality  level  biosimilarity  between  PB006  and  EU-sourced  Tysabri,  which  was  used  as 
clinical  comparator,  could  be  demonstrated  for  most  quality  attributes  in  a  comprehensive  analytical 
similarity  exercise.  In  the  PK/PD  study  EU-and  US-sourced  Tysabri  were  applied,  and  biosimilarity 
between both products could be demonstrated in the analytical similarity exercise.  
Overall,  taking  into  account  the  totality  of  the  data  provided,  biosimilarity  of  Tyruko  with  Tysabri  is 
considered demonstrated from a quality point of view. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The  overall  quality  of  Tyruko  is  considered  acceptable  when  used  in  accordance  with  the  conditions 
defined in the SmPC. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation 
comply with existing guidelines.  
In  conclusion,  based  on  the  review  of  the  data  provided,  the  marketing  authorisation  application  for 
Tyruko is considered approvable from the quality point of view. 
2.4.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
None. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Analytical  and  functional  similarity  studies  of  PB006  to  both  US-  and  EU-Tysabri  are  described  and 
discussed in the Quality Assessment Report. No additional non-clinical PD studies, neither in vitro nor in 
vivo,  were  performed  for  this  MAA.  However,  a  comparative  four-week  repeated-dose  toxicity  study 
including  a  supportive  toxicokinetic  evaluation  was  conducted  to  compare  the  systemic  PK  and 
toxicological profile between PB006 and EU-Tysabri in Cynomolgus monkeys following IV infusion.  
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 30/149 
 
 
 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
No in vivo PD animal studies investigating analytical, physiochemical and functional similarity between 
PB006 and its referenced medicinal product (RMP) Tysabri (sourced from EU) were conducted in addition 
to the analytical biosimilarity assessment (see quality assessment).  
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Neither  stand-alone  comparative  PK  studies  nor  separate  absorption,  distribution,  metabolism  and/or 
excretion  studies  were  performed  with  PB006  and  EU-Tysabri.  A  comparative  four-week  repeat-dose 
toxicity study including supportive toxicokinetic evaluation was conducted to compare the systemic PK 
profile  between  PB006  and  EU-Tysabri  in  Cynomolgus  monkeys  (3  animals/sex/treatment  group) 
following IV infusion. Natalizumab (PB006 or Tysabri) was given every other day at dose levels of 3 or 
30mg/kg body weight. Blood samples for toxicokinetic analysis were obtained predose and several hours 
post  dose  after  the  end  of  infusion  on  test  days  1  and  30.  To  measure  the  concentrations  of  free 
Natalizumab  (PB006  or  Tysabri)  in  the  cynomolgus  monkey  serum  samples,  a  quantitative  antibody 
sandwich  enzyme  linked  immunosorbent  assay  (ELISA)  was  validated.  All  projected  validation 
parameters and acceptance criteria, as calibration of a standard curve, accuracy, precision, freeze/thaw 
stability, long term stability and determination of a LLOQ (Lower Limit of Quantification), were met. In 
addition, an ELISA assay for determination of PB006 and EU-Tysabri in application formulation samples 
and an ELISA method for determination of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) against Natalizumab (PB006 or 
EU-Tysabri) in cynomolgus monkey serum were validated. All validation results fulfilled the necessary 
requirements.  
Exposure  ratios  based  on  Cmax (maximum  concentration)  and  AUC0-last (area  under  the  concentration-
time  curve  from  time  0  to  the  time  of  the  last  measured  concentration)  were  observed  to  be  highly 
similar for all treatment groups on day 1, whereas on test day 30 differences were noted between the 
Cmax and AUC values of PB006 and Tysabri in the high dose groups (males: 2831.3 µg/mL [SD: 604.6] 
of PB006 and 1708.6 µg/mL [SD: 651.9] of Tysabri; females: 1764.3 µg/mL [SD: 736.1] of PB006 or 
858.7 µg/mL [SD: 868.2] of Tysabri). According to the applicant, this observation was considered to be 
due to ADA formation. To mention, in the high dose groups, only one animal was ADA positive on study 
day  30,  specifically  a  female  monkey  of  the  Tysabri  treatment  group,  which  had  already  been  ADA 
positive pre-dose on day 1. Therefore, this explanation might be applicable for females, whereas it cannot 
explain the differences observed between both Natalizumabs in male animals. Almost all animals in the 
low  dose  group  of  PB006  and  Tysabri  were  found  to  be  ADA  positive  on  test  day  30  and  showed  low 
serum levels of the drug substance, although female animals treated with Tysabri had significant lower 
ADA levels (one of them had no ADAs at all), with corresponding slightly higher Natalizumab levels in 
serum  samples,  compared  to  PB006  treated  female  monkeys.  Hence,  ADA  formation  seems  to  have 
neutralizing character mirrored by decreased levels of Natalizumab, especially in PB006 treated female 
animals. The lack of detection of ADAs that presumably also appeared in the high dose groups of PB006 
and Tysabri, could be attributed to either immunotolerance due to high dose treatment or to the masking 
of these antibodies that reacted and were saturated with the test or reference item, respectively, and 
therefore, not quantifiable. Nevertheless, the low group size (3 animals/sex/group) in conjunction with 
individual data variability is limiting the sensitivity of the test system and therefore does not allow to 
reliably distinguish between identified differences of PB006 and Tysabri treated animals.

2.5.4.  Toxicology 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
No dedicated single-dose toxicological studies were conducted with PB006.  
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
The applicant conducted a 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys to evaluate and 
compare  potential  toxicological  findings  and  the  toxicokinetic  profile  of  PB006  with  its  referenced 
medicinal  product  Tysabri,  sourced  from  EU.  The  4  week-duration  of  this  study  is  consistent  with  the 
posology  of  PB006  which  is  to  be  administered  by  IV  infusion  once  every  4  weeks.  Therapy  may  be 
continued up to 2 years (after that therapy should be considered only following a reassessment of the 
potential  for  benefit  and  risk).  However,  up  to  6  months  repeated-dose  toxicity  studies  have  been 
performed  with  Tysabri  and  as  analytical  and  functional  similarity  of  PB006  to  EU-Tysabri  was 
demonstrated in in vitro studies, longer duration toxicity studies of PB006 were not conducted and are 
not considered relevant for this biosimilar development, in which reference is made to EMA’s previous 
findings on safety and efficacy of Tysabri. The Cynomolgus monkey is considered an adequate model for 
the toxicity study of PB006, as Cynomolgus monkeys were consistently used in the original nonclinical 
studies performed for registration of the reference product Tysabri. 
Animals were assigned to 5 treatment groups (control group, low and high dose groups of PB006 and 
Tysabri; with 3 animals/sex/group) receiving IV infusions of Natalizumab (0, 3 or 30mg/kg b.w.) every 
other day. No findings and noteworthy differences were observed with PB006 or Tysabri treated animals 
regarding  local  tolerance,  mortality,  clinical  signs  (systemic  tolerance),  body  weight  and  body  weight 
gain,  food  and  drinking  water  consumption,  electrocardiogram  (ECG),  circulatory  functions,  clinical 
biochemistry,  urinalysis,  ophthalmological  and  auditory  examinations,  macroscopic  systemic  post 
mortem findings, organ weights and histopathology. Observed differences between control groups and 
PB006 and RMP treated animals may likely be due to the limited sample size (3 animals/sex/group) and 
variability within individual animals.  
However, some changes in haematological parameters were reported by the applicant. Both high dose 
groups  (30mg/kg  of  PB006  or  Tysabri)  showed  an  increase  in  the  absolute  number  of  the  total  and 
differential  leucocyte  count  and  in  the  number  of  reticulocytes,  which  are  considered  common  and 
reproducible  effects  of  natalizumab  in  Cynomolgus  monkeys.  Furthermore,  again  concerning  the  high 
dose groups, an increase in the absolute number of all lymphocyte subtypes compared to the control 
was  noted.  Overall,  with  some  exceptions  (e.g.  sup./cyt.  T-cells  and  act.  sup./cyt.  T-cells  for  PB006, 
30mg/kg; act. sup./cyt. T-cells and double negative T-cells for Tysabri, 30 mg/kg), these observations 
were slightly more obvious in male animals. Again, differences between the treatment groups might be 
relativized by disparities of values from animals within the same treatment groups and limited sample 
size. Male and female animals treated with 3 or 30 mg/kg Natalizumab (PB006 or Tysabri) revealed to 
have elevated myeloid : erythroid ratios. Low and high dosage groups of PB006 treated animals seemed 
to be slightly more affected compared to animals treated with the RMP. 
ADA formation was investigated in the course of the 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus 
monkeys. Almost all animals in the low dose groups of PB006 and Tysabri were found to be ADA positive 
on test day 30 with corresponding low levels of Natalizumab in serum samples. Female animals treated 
with 3mg/kg Tysabri had significantly lower ADA levels (one out of three revealed to have none at all), 
compared to 3mg/kg PB006 treated female monkeys, which correlates with slightly higher Natalizumab 
levels in serum samples in the RMP treated group. In contrast to the low dose groups, no ADAs were

reported for the high dose groups of PB006 and Tysabri, with the exception of one female animal of the 
EU-Tysabri group that already showed to have ADAs prior to its first Natalizumab infusion.    
The applicant determined the No-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level to be above 30 mg/kg PB006 or EU-
Tysabri (IV, every second day for 4 weeks), with the justification that all findings were considered to be 
anticipated PD effects of natalizumab being a monoclonal antibody binding to α4 integrin. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
No dedicated genotoxicity studies were conducted with PB006. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
No dedicated carcinogenicity studies were conducted with PB006.  
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
No dedicated developmental and reproductive studies were conducted with PB006.  
2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
A comparative four-week repeat-dose toxicity study including a supportive toxicokinetic evaluation was 
conducted to compare the systemic PK profile between PB006 and EU-Tysabri in cynomolgus monkeys 
(3 animals/sex/treatment group) following IV infusion. For further details please refer to section 2.5.3. 
Pharmacokinetics.  
2.5.4.7.  Local Tolerance  
No  local  tolerance  studies  were  performed  with  PB006  given  that  all  the  excipients  used  in  the  final 
commercial  formulation  are  commonly  used  in  currently  approved  biologics  with  the  same  exposure 
levels and same intended route of administration. Moreover, even if stand-alone local tolerance studies 
of PB006 have not been performed, in the 4 weeks repeated dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkey, 
no test item-related signs of local intolerance have been shown. 
2.5.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
No dedicated “Other toxicity studies” were conducted with PB006.  
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In line with the Guideline on the environmental risk assessment (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2) in 
case  of  products  containing  proteins,  the  applicant  provided  a  justification  that  the  use  of  Tyruko  is 
unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment. 
This is acceptable. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacodynamics 
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 33/149 
 
 
 
No  in  vivo  PD  animal  studies  were  conducted  in  addition  to  the  analytical  in  vitro  biosimilarity 
assessment. This is accepted and in agreement with the EMA Guideline on similar biological medicinal 
products  (CHMP/437/04  Rev  1;  2014)  and  the  EMA  Guideline  on  similar  biological  medicinal  products 
containing  biotechnology-derived  proteins  as  active  substance:  non-clinical  and  clinical  issues 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev 1).  
For review of the biosimilar comparability exercise, please refer to the discussion and conclusion section 
of the respective quality assessment.    
Pharmacokinetics 
Overall, methods of analysis were adequately validated and the applicant’s approach can be regarded as 
appropriate. The results of the validations confirmed that the methods employed were suitable for the 
detection of Natalizumab (PB006 and Tysabri) in application formulations and cynomolgus monkey serum 
samples, and for the detection of ADAs against PB006 or EU-Tysabri in cynomolgus monkey serum. 
The  similarity  between  the  originator  and  the  biosimilar  product  was  assessed  in  the  in  vitro  quality 
biocomparability testing. In contrast to in vitro methods, in vivo studies in animals are not necessarily 
considered informative for the PK similarity / comparability exercise. Due to the high variability, these 
models  are  often  too  insensitive.  This  conclusion  concerns  both  PK  comparisons  and  comparisons  on 
safety.  Based  on  these  considerations,  these  comparative  studies  in  animal  models  have  been 
discouraged in a previous Scientific Advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/224608/2017). 
Additionally, ADA data from animals are not predictive for the clinical situation, and comparative data 
on ADA are of uncertain relevance. Potential differences in immunogenicity between PB006 and Tysabri 
should  be  evaluated  in  the  clinical  setup.  Therefore,  the  conducted  in  vivo  study  can  at  most  be 
considered supportive, but not as evidence of true clinical similarity. 
As indicated by the applicant, the comparative 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys 
with PB006 and EU-Tysabri, including toxicokinetic evaluations, was conducted to satisfy requirements 
laid out by other health authorities at that time to support entry into global clinical development. The 
study design, as well as provided data (e.g. results of ADA and Natalizumab concentration evaluations) 
are considered adequate and sufficient for this purpose. Toxicokinetic data evaluation revealed that there 
were no noteworthy differences between PB006 and Tysabri with respect to their toxicokinetic profiles in 
monkeys. As demonstrated in the Tysabri EPAR, natalizumab shows a pk typical profile of monoclonal 
antibodies,  with  dose-dependent  but  not  dose-proportional  increases  in  Cmax  and  AUC  values  and 
increases in elimination half-lives with increasing dose. This profile is probably the result of saturation of 
the major antibody clearance pathway (Fc-mediated phagocytosis). 
In  this  sense,  it  is  acknowledged  that  the  in  vivo  study  was  conducted  due  to  expectations  from 
regulatory  bodies  competent  for  non-European  regions.  Though  not  endorsed,  these  in  vivo  testing 
studies are accepted. 
Toxicology 
Generally, studies regarding toxicology, including developmental and reproductive toxicity studies, are 
not required for non-clinical testing of biosimilars according to the EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1 
guideline.  Neither  are  studies  regarding  safety  pharmacology,  carcinogenicity  and  local  tolerance. 
Scientific advice was provided by the EMA (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/224608/2017), supporting the proposed 
strategy of the applicant to not conduct in vivo animal studies to assess biosimilarity between PB006 and 
its RMP Tysabri. Nevertheless, a comparative 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys 
was conducted to satisfy requirements laid out by other health authorities to support entry into global 
clinical development.  
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 34/149 
 
 
 
Overall,  the  study  design  is  regarded  as  appropriate  in  terms  of  species  selection,  used  dosages, 
frequency and route of administration. Observed findings, such as increased haematological parameters 
(lymphocytes, reticulocytes; myeloid: erythroid ratio), were seen in all animals treated with either PB006 
or  Tysabri.  Altered  trafficking  of  lymphocytes,  seen  as  an  increase  in  white  blood  cells,  was  already 
reported in the EPAR of Tysabri (EPAR Tysabri, latest updated version 8th of June 2022) and was described 
to be reversible without any adverse toxicological changes. In this comparative repeat-dose toxicology 
study with PB006 and EU- Tysabri, no recovery groups were included. Although this would have been of 
interest, the lack of a recovery period is accepted, because reported findings of Natalizumab are already 
known for Tysabri and related to its pharmacological activity. A main issue remains the limited number 
of  animals  per  treatment  group  (3/sex/group),  which  does  not  allow  to  reliable  distinguish  between 
differences in findings of PB006 and Tysabri treated animals and individual data variability. Based on the 
results of the study and taking into consideration the intrinsic variability of the model, the limited sample 
size and the absence of adverse histopathological findings in any of the animals, there was no noteworthy 
difference between the animals treated with PB006 and the animals treated with Tysabri from a toxicity 
and toxicokinetic point of view. All findings were considered to be anticipated PD effects of natalizumab 
as a monoclonal antibody binding to α4 integrin, i.e inhibition of lymphocyte migration from blood vessels 
into the surrounding tissues. Blocking of the α4 integrin also allows migration of the immature red blood 
cells  from  the  bone  marrow  and  consequently,  the  increase  in  progenitor  cell  circulation.  No  new 
unexpected toxicities were identified for PB006. The marginal differences observed are considered to be 
within the biological variability. The toxicological similarity assessment raised no concerns. Therefore, 
data  obtained  from  this  repeat-dose  toxicology  study  can  be  regarded  as  supportive  information  in 
addition to the in vitro similarity/comparability exercise, discussed in the quality part of the dossier.  
Regarding the ADA assessment of this study, the applicant provided a discussion for possible reasons for 
ADA detection prior to first infusion on day 1 for female animal number 30 of the 30 mg/kg b.w. Tysabri 
treatment  group.  It  was  confirmed  that  according  to  the  protocol  only  treatment  naïve  animals  were 
used  in  the  repeat-dose  toxicology  study  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  and  that  due  to  the  consistent 
discrepancy  at  both  pre-  dose  and  on  day  30,  contamination  of  the  serum  samples  is  unlikely.  The 
existence  of  pre-existing  drug-reactive  antibodies  as  well  as  other  non-antibody  interferences  in  the 
ELISA  assay  (e.g.  matrix  effects  leading  to  the  binding  of  the  biotinylated  antibody)  was  discussed, 
whereat a non-ADA mechanism seems to be more likely (as no ADAs developed in other animals in the 
high dose group due to interference with high Tysabri levels). Furthermore, serum natalizumab levels of 
this female animal were similar to the serum natalizumab concentrations in other animals of this dose 
group and ADA detection at pre-dose in female number 30 had no influence on data interpretation in 
this study. 
Environmental Risk Assessment 
The  active  substance  is  a  natural  substance,  the  use  of  which  will  not  alter  the  concentration  or 
distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore Tyruko is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment.  
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical dossier can be considered acceptable.

GCP aspects 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the Community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
The development program comprises 4 clinical studies: 1 pivotal Phase 1 PK/ PD study with PB006, US-
Tysabri, and EU-Tysabri in healthy subjects, 1 pivotal Phase 3 study with PB006 versus EU-Tysabri in 
patients with RRMS, 1 pilot Phase 1 PK/PD study with EU-Tysabri in healthy subjects and 1 supportive 
Phase 1 safety study with PB006 in healthy subjects.

* A subset of 30 patients enrolled in the EU-Tysabri group was switched after 24 weeks from treatment with EU-Tysabri to treatment 
with PB006 for the remaining period. Thus, a total of 161 patients were treated with PB006. 
2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PB006-01-03. was a Phase 1 multicenter, double-blind, randomized, single-dose, 3-arm, parallel-
group PK/PD study in healthy subjects, to investigate the similarity between PB006 versus US-Tysabri 
and versus EU-Tysabri.  
Study  PB006-03-01  was  a  phase  3  confirmatory  efficacy  and  safety  study  in  RRMS  patients  and  is 
presented in detail under efficacy section. Apart from efficacy evaluation based on MRI endpoints, relapse 
rates  and  disability  status,  this  study  also  assessed  natalizumab  trough  concentrations  and 
immunogenicity.

Analytical methods 
For  quantification  of  MAdCAM-1  and  VCAM-1  levels  in  human  serum,  the  applicant  has  applied  an 
automated  ELISA  system  based  on  the  Simple  Plex  ELLA  multiplex  platform  together  with  combined 
MAdCAM-1 and VCAM-1 analysis kits purchased from R&D Systems. In brief, diluted samples and running 
buffer  are  pipetted  into  the  inlet  of  a  cartridge.  Samples  are  directed  by  microfluidic  channels  into 
different  compartments,  where  they  interact  with  analyte  specific  capture  and  labelled  detection 
antibodies  pairs.  After  fully  automated,  sequential  incubation  and  washing  steps  fluorescence  is 
measured through glass nano reactor tubes. Each cartridge lot of the assay is already provided in a pre-
validated format, including pre-validated ranges from 0.003 ng/ml to 13 ng/ml and from 0.6 ng/ml to 
83 ng/ml for MAdCAM-1 and VCAM-1, respectively. Factory calibration curves are generated on a lot-to-
lot basis, including assessment of accuracy and precision over the acceptance range. The manufacturer 
also confirms robustness of the assay for the duration of the cartridge shelf life. No additional calibration 
samples  nor  calibration  curves  were  generated.  Partial  re-validation  of  the  assay  for  each  cartridge 
included the assessment of precision for QC (quality control) samples, the evaluation of a prozone (hook 
effect),  selectivity  (haemolyzed,  lipemic  samples),  drug  tolerance  (confirmed  up  to  328  µg/ml), 
freeze/thaw  stability,  bench-top  stability  for  up  to  24  hours,  freeze/thaw  stability  and  frozen  sample 
storage  stability.  Activities  were  performed  at  ICON  Bioanalytical  Laboratories,  NL  and  at  PRA  Health 
Sciences, NL. Samples were applied only once but measured in triplicates, and standard settings in the 
software were used for data evaluation, acceptance and rejection (>10.0% coefficient variation of the 
RFU)  criteria.  QC  samples  (low,  medium  and  high  concentration)  were  prepared  by  using  reagents 
(controls  and  assay  diluents)  from  the  kit.  Thus  some  aspects  of  the  method  validation  such  as 
determination of precision and prozone effect were performed in assay buffer. Blank human serum was 
used  as  endogenous  QC  sample,  and  to  monitor  the  longitudinal  assay  performance.  All  pre-defined 
validation  parameters  were  met.  Frozen  storage  stability  at  -70°C  was  demonstrated  for  at  least  65 
weeks for MAdCAM-1. For VCAM-1 endogenous QC samples were measured over a period of 65 weeks, 
confirming stability of study samples. Taken together, provided validation program covered most but not 
all aspects: Assay intermediate precision and repeatability were not indicated, and it is unclear if a matrix 
representative for the clinical samples was used by the manufacturer of the kit for the assessment of 
accuracy  and  range.  The  applicant  has  applied  assay  buffer  for  re-validation  of  precision  and  for  the 
assessment of a potential prozone effect. The applicant provided further details on validation activities 
and justified the omission of the human serum matrix for the assessment of the precision and prozone 
effect.  Proposed  automated  ELISA  multiplex  MAdCAM-1  and  VCAM-1  assay  seems  suitable  for  the 
intended application. 
The  applicant  has  developed  and  validated  for  assessment  of  PK  two  sandwich  ELISA  to  quantify 
“unexchanged”  and  total  Natalizumab  in  human  serum  samples.  The  term  “unexchanged”  refers  to 
bivalent  antibodies  which  have  not  undergone  Fab-arm  exchange.  Thus  this  assay  is  detecting 
“functional” Natalizumab, which fulfils the purpose of a PK assay, and total amounts of Natalizumab by 
two  different  ELISA.  In  brief,  Natalizumab  is  captured  in  the  functional  Natalizumab  setting  by  an 
immobilised  anti-Natalizumab  Fab  (Fragment  antigen-binding)  and  detected  via  an  HRP-labelled  anti-
Natalizumab-MAb  conjugate.  For  the  total  Natalizumab  setting,  a  human  monoclonal  Natalizumab 
specific IgG1 antibody is used as coating agent, while detection occurs via a HRP-labelled murine anti-
human IgG4  antibody. Standard curves were fitted in both cases using a 4  parameter  logistic model, 
and  used  for  the  evaluation  of  concentrations  of  unknown  samples.  Both  methods  seem  scientifically 
justified.  They  were  fully  validated  for  their  precision,  selectivity  (in  normal  and  in  patient  serum), 
minimal required dilution, range (from 60-400 ng/ml in both cases), integrity of dilution and robustness 
by assessing the impact of haemolytic and lipemic serum, as well as freeze-thaw, bench top, and long-
term stability for samples and stock solutions). Specific recognition of “unexchanged” Natalizumab in the 
first ELISA setting was sufficiently demonstrated. The validation matrix was a pool of a suitable number 
of  patient  serum  samples,  and  thus  representative.  All  reagents,  their  provenience  and  the  most

important  methodological  details  were  reported.  Validation  reports  and  respective  amendments  were 
provided. All predefined acceptance criteria of study plans were met which qualifies both PK assays for 
their intended use. 
Administration  of  Natalizumab  is  associated  with  increased  numbers  of  CD19+  B  cells  and  increased 
numbers  of  immature  CD34+  progenitor  cells  released  from  the  bone  marrow.  The  applicant  has 
developed  a  battery  of  FACS  based  assays  for  immuno-phenotyping  of  whole  blood  cells,  in  order  to 
assess bio-similarity of PB006, Tysabri EU and Tysabri US. Samples were analyzed with a flow cytometer 
(FACSCanto  II)  equipped  for  measuring  FITC,  PE,  PerCP-Cy5.5,  PE-Cy7,  APC  and  APC-Cy7.  BD 
FACSCanto  Clinical  Software  v3.1  was  used  for  data  acquisition.  For  data  processing,  De  Novo 
FCSExpress 6 Flow Clinical Edition was used. 
Quantification of CD19+ B-cells in human whole blood was part of this comparability study. CD19 may 
be involved in activation and proliferation of B lymphocytes and is expressed at all stages of maturation, 
but gets lost on plasma cells. In brief, whole blood samples are treated with anti-coagulant K3EDTA and 
fixation reagent Cyto-Chex BCT. Staining is performed with BD Multitest™ 6-color TBNK Reagent, while 
only B-cells were reported in this study. A validation run is performed each day including the use of setup 
beads  with  stable  fluorescence  intensity  through  time  to  ensure  stable  performance  of  the  flow 
cytometer. Prior to the staining of cells, a white blood cell (WBC) count was carried out to ensure that 
the total WBC count was between below 33.0x106 WBC/mL. Two separate validation reports for the same 
analytical  procedure  were  provided  for  the  NL  and  the  US  site.  A  cross-validation  of  bioanalytical 
laboratories was performed. The assay was validated for its repeatability, intermediate precision, and 
reproducibility  between  Assen  (NL)  and  Lenexa  (US)  Bioanalytical  Laboratories.  Inter-operator 
reproducibility and inter-analyst data analysis reproducibility were evaluated. Blank matrix consisted of 
whole blood donations from three individuals collected at 5 time-points. Inter-assay reproducibility was 
analysed in three runs on three separate days. Stability of whole blood and stained cells as well as carry-
over were also assessed. Tysabri EU, Tysabri US and PB006 had the same outcome with regards to intra-
assay reproducibility, whole blood stability and stained cell stability. Therefore it was concluded that the 
assay  is  measuring  all  3  compounds  in  a  comparable  way.  The  method  met  the  requirements  of  the 
validation plan and was considered suitable for determination of CD19+ B cells in human whole blood 
samples. 
The same quantification protocol for CD34+ cells in human whole blood was applied in studies PLP19696-
19696X-O  (NL)  and  PLP19696-19696XP  (US).  Two  separate  bioanalytical  reports  were  provided.  The 
single tube BD™ Stem Cell Enumeration kit was used enabling simultaneous enumeration of viable dual 
positive CD45+/CD34+ hematopoietic stem cell populations. The absolute number of positive cells in the 
sample was determined by comparing cellular events to a known number of fluorescent beads released 
by  BD  Trucount  reagent.  Concentration,  number  and  percentage  of  CD34+  cells  of  the  CD45+  cell 
population  were  reported.  WBC  counts  prior  to  each  measurement  ensured  that  samples  were  in  the 
linear  range  of  the  assay.  Validation  parameters  included  intra-assay  reproducibility,  inter-assay 
reproducibility,  interoperator  reproducibility,  inter-analyst-data-analysis  reproducibility,  stability  of 
whole  blood,  stability  of  stained  cells,  carry-over  and  cross-validation  of  NL  and  US  bioanalytical 
laboratories. PB006, EU-Tysabri and US-Tysabri were comparable within the assay, and the method was 
found to be suitable for the intended application. 
Saturation  of  α4-integrin  on  leukocytes  surfaces  is  part  of  Natalizumab’s  mechanism  of  action.  α4-
integrin %RS in human whole blood is assessed by the same flow cytometry assay, which was validated 
in studies PLP19696-19696X-L (NL) and PLP19696-19696X-N (US), for analysis of samples collected at 
EU and US sites, respectively. Two separate bioanalytical reports were provided. In brief, Leukocytes are 
quantified via CD45, and α4-integrin bound Natalizumab by addition of mouse anti-human IgG4 Fc-PE. 
Maximum %RS was assessed in a second aliquot of each sample where unlabelled PB006 was added. 
The  method  was  validated  for  its  intra-assay  reproducibility,  inter-assay  reproducibility,  interoperator

reproducibility,  inter-analyst-data-analysis  reproducibility,  stability  of  whole  blood,  stability  of  stained 
cells, carry-over and cross-validation of bioanalytical laboratories and found to be suitable for analysis 
of clinical samples. Again PB006, EU-Tysabri and US-Tysabri were comparable within the assay, and the 
method was found to be suitable for the intended application. 
Bioequivalence (Study PB006-01-03) 
Study PB006-01-03 was a multicenter PK/PD study in healthy subjects, to support the demonstration of 
similarity between PB006 versus EU-Tysabri and versus US-Tysabri.  
Methods 
Study design 
This was a randomized, double-blind study with 3 parallel arms in 453 healthy male and female subjects. 
Subjects received a single dose of 3 mg/kg PB006, EU-approved Tysabri, or US-licensed Tysabri as an 
IV infusion over a 60-minute period. Dosing was followed by PK and PD sampling for 85 days and a final 
follow-up  visit  6  months  (24  weeks)  after  dosing  to  assess  new neurological  symptoms  that  could  be 
suggestive for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Safety was monitored throughout the 
study  by  repeated  clinical  and  laboratory  evaluations.  Samples  were  collected  for  immunogenicity 
assessments for 85 days. 
The study was performed at six clinical sites, 4 of which were in the US, 1 in the Netherlands, and 1 in 
Poland. 
Study participants 
Healthy male and female subjects aged 18 to 65 years (18 to 54 years after implementation of protocol 
amendment 3), with a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 30.0 kg/m2 (body weight 50 – 92 kg), who 
were anti-John Cunningham virus (JCV) antibody negative and tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 before 
dosing were eligible for this study. 
Treatments 
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to PB006, US-Tysabri or EU-Tysabri and received single IV 
infusions of 3 mg/kg natalizumab. 
The  study  drug  was  administered  on  day  1  with  the  subject  in  the  upright  position.  Subjects  fasted 
overnight for at least 10 hours following a light supper on the evening before. Breakfast was consumed 
after  the  end  of  the  IV  infusion.  During  fasting,  no  fluids  were  allowed  except  water;  water  was  not 
allowed from 2 hours prior to dosing until the end of the IV infusion. A fasting period of at least 4 hours 
was required before obtaining clinical laboratory samples at all time points. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate PK and PD similarity of PB006 to both US-licensed 
Tysabri and EU-approved Tysabri. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
PK endpoints 
The primary PK endpoint was AUC0-inf of total natalizumab, which was compared between PB006, EU-
Tysabri,  and  US-Tysabri  in  a  3-way  comparison.  This  comparison  was  part  of  a  hierarchical  testing 
procedure. As a prerequisite for the pooling of the reference, PK similarity needed to be established (PK 
bridge between EU-Tysabri and US-Tysabri) and a pre-defined pooling criterion had to be fulfilled. For 
the  3  pairwise  comparisons  of  AUC0-inf  the  90%  CI  (confidence  interval)  for  the  ratio  of  the  test  and 
reference products should be contained within the acceptance interval of 80.00% to 125.00%. 
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 39/149 
 
 
 
As secondary PK endpoints, AUC0-t, Cmax, and tmax (time to Cmax) of total natalizumab were selected to 
support the PK comparability of PB006 to EU-Tysabri and US-Tysabri. Further secondary PK endpoints 
were AUC0-inf, AUC0-t, Cmax, and tmax of unexchanged natalizumab. Other PK parameters were analyzed 
descriptively. 
PD endpoints 
For PD, two co-primary endpoints were selected: AUEC0-12w (area under the effect curve from zero to 12 
weeks) of baseline-adjusted CD19+, and AUEC0-12w of α4-integrin %RS. As an additional analysis, AUEC4-
12w  (area  under  the  effect  curve  from  4  to  12  weeks)  for  α4-integrin  %RS  was  specified.  For  these 
parameters the 95% CI for the ratio of the test and reference products should be contained within the 
acceptance interval of 80.00% to 125.00%. 
Secondary  PD  endpoints  included  Emax  (maximum  effect)  and  tmax  of  baseline-adjusted  CD19+, 
AUECbase_neg, (area below the individual baseline value minus the area above the individual baseline in 
case of time intervals for which the effect time curve exceeded the baseline value), Emin (minimum effect), 
tmin (time to minimum concentration) of sVCAM and sMAdCAM and AUEC0-t (area under the effect curve 
from zero to last timepoint), Emax, tmax of CD34+.  
Prior  to  each  PK  sampling  point,  each  subject  was  to  remain  at  least  5  minutes  in  a  supine  position. 
Blood samples of 6 mL each were taken for analysis of total and unexchanged natalizumab in plasma 
samples. Blood samples of approximately 11 mL were collected for measurement of relative a-integrin 
receptor saturation (a-integrin %RS) and CD19+ and CD34+ cells. Blood samples of approximately 6 
mL were collected for measurement of sVCAM and sMAdCAM. 
Sample size 
The sample size calculation was based on the following assumptions: 
• 
Test/Reference ratio: 
o  PK: 0.95–1/0.95 for AUC0-inf, 
o  PD: 0.95–1/0.95 for AUC0-12w for baseline-adjusted CD19+ and AUC0-12w  for α4-integrin 
%RS 
•  Significance level: 5% (Two one-sided tests corresponding to 90% CIs for the Test/Reference 
ratio) 
•  Similarity margin: 0.8000–1.2500 
•  Randomization ratio: 1:1:1 
The assumptions for the coefficients of variation for the arithmetic means (CV) and for the geometric 
means (gCV) were based on the data of the pilot study Tysabri Pilot-01-01. 
The demonstration of PD similarity was planned to be conducted while combining the data of the US and 
EU-reference products for the statistical analysis of the primary PD endpoint baseline-adjusted CD19+ 
AUEC0-12w and α4-integrin %RS AUEC0-12w subsequent to having established the PK bridge between the 2 
reference products and meeting the predefined pooling criterion. 
For the 3-way comparisons of PK a between-subject gCV of 36% was assumed for the first step of the 
hierarchical testing strategy. For the PD hypothesis, tested in the second step of the hierarchical model, 
a between-subject gCV of 56% was assumed. For the sample size consideration, the PD endpoint α4-
integrin %RS was neglected, since the variability was considered lower compared to CD19+ AUEC0-12w. 
In earlier protocol versions 82 evaluable subjects per arm were seen required to ensure an overall power 
of at least 80% (93% power for each of the 3 pairwise comparisons resulting in 0.93x0.93x0.93=0.804) 
including the comparison of US-licensed Tysabri vs EU-approved Tysabri establishing the PK bridge.

According to the latest protocol version, the analysis of baseline-adjusted CD19+ AUEC0-12w pooling US-
licensed Tysabri and EU-approved Tysabri subsequent to having established the PK and thus the scientific 
bridge resulted in a 1:2 randomization ratio.  
Total N=411 evaluable subjects (137 evaluable subjects per arm) was derived by updated sample size 
calculations, using a 90% CI for the geometric mean ratio, which resulted in a power of 93%. Using a 
95% CI, which was seen required to meet global regulatory expectations, for the geometric mean ratio 
resulted in a power of 88%. The power above 80% seemed to be appropriate to account for the additional 
PD endpoint α4-integrin %RS. 
After accounting for 10% drop-outs, the total number of subjects to be randomized was calculated to be 
453  subjects  (151  per  treatment  group).  The  10%  drop-out  rate  included  subjects  that  terminated 
prematurely  (discontinued  from  the  study  or  withdraw  consent),  as  well  as  subjects  with  protocol 
deviations that warranted their exclusion from the analysis of the primary endpoint. 
Randomisation 
After obtaining informed consent, subjects were to be screened according to the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria. Subjects who met all eligibility criteria were supposed to receive a subject number upon inclusion 
in  the  study.  Subjects  were  planned  to  be  randomly  assigned  in  a  [1:1:1]  ratio  to  receive  study 
intervention. Stratification was to be performed according to body weight class in order to ensure balance 
across  the  study  arms  (50kg  to  65kg,  >65kg  to  80kg,  >80kg  to  92kg).  No  gender  stratification  was 
deemed necessary, as gender was not found to have an effect on the PK properties of natalizumab. The 
study  was  planned  to  be  performed  at  6  sites  by  competitive  recruitment.  The  clinical  study  protocol 
(CSP) defined 3 weight groups in order to ensure balance across the study arms; however, all eligible 
subjects were to be admitted in the study. For that reason, 18 randomization lists were created, 1 per 
site and weight group combination. Subjects were to receive the subject number just prior to dosing and 
according  to  the  randomization  code  generated.  The  subject  number  was  to  ensure  identification 
throughout the study. Replacement subjects were to be administered the same treatment as the subject 
replaced.  The  final  randomization  list  was  created,  reviewed,  and  approved  by  2  designated 
biostatisticians  who  were  not  members  of  the  study  team.  After  the  final  randomisation  list  was 
approved, it was transferred to the responsible pharmacy and kept in a restricted area. 
Blinding 
Subjects  were  planned  to  be  randomly  assigned  in  a  [1:1:1]  ratio  to  receive  study  intervention. 
Investigators were planned to remained blinded to each subject’s assigned study intervention throughout 
the course of the study. In order to maintain this blind, an otherwise uninvolved third party (e.g, site 
pharmacy staff) was planned to be responsible for the dilution and dispensing of all study intervention 
and delivery to site. 
A sealed envelope that contained the study intervention assignment for each subject was planned to be 
provided  to  the  Investigator.  The  sealed  envelope  was  to  be  retained  by  the  Investigator  (or 
representative) in a secured area. In case of an emergency, the Investigator had the sole responsibility 
for determining if unblinding of a subject’s treatment assignment was warranted.  
If the Investigator decided that unblinding was warranted, the Investigator had to make every effort to 
contact  the  Sponsor  prior  to  unblinding  a  subject’s  treatment  assignment,  unless  this  could  delay 
emergency treatment of the subject. If a subject’s treatment assignment was unblinded, the Sponsor 
was to be notified within 24 hours after breaking the blind.

Safety Population 
All  subjects  assigned  to  study  intervention  and  who  were  dosed  with  study  intervention  were  to  be 
included in this population. Subjects were to be analysed according to the study drug received. 
Pharmacokinetic Population 
All subjects randomized to study intervention and who were dosed with study intervention and have not 
experienced any major protocol deviations that might impact PK results and provide sufficient samples 
to allow calculation of the PK endpoint AUC0-inf were to be included in this population. 
Pharmacodynamic/Target Receptor Engagement Population 
All subjects randomized to study intervention and who were dosed with study intervention and did not 
experience  any  major  protocol  deviations  that  might  impact  the  PD  results  and  provided  sufficient 
samples to allow calculation of the primary PD endpoints AUEC0-12w of baseline-adjusted CD19+ and/or 
α4-integrin %RS were to be included in this population. 
There were several analysis sets defined in addition to the sets originally defined in the SAP: CD19+ 
Set, RS/RO Set – primary analysis for AUEC0-12w, RS/RO Set – sensitivity analysis for AUEC0-12w, RS/RO 
Set – main analysis for AUEC4-12w, RS/RO Set – sensitivity analysis for AUEC4-12w, and PD Other Set 
– analysis set for VCAM, MadCAM, CD34. 
General aspects of statistical analyses 
Baseline (demographic) data was planned to be summarized by treatment group, PK, PD, and safety 
results by treatment group and time point.  
Statistical analysis methods for primary endpoints 
All PK analyses were to be performed on the PK Set. 
For the analysis of the primary PK parameter AUC0-inf of total natalizumab a 3-way comparison was to 
be performed containing the comparison of PB006 to both US-licensed Tysabri and EU-approved Tysabri 
as well as the PK bridge between US-licensed Tysabri and EU-approved Tysabri. The 3-way comparison 
was  the  first  step  of  the  2-step  hierarchical  testing  procedure.  For  each  comparison  an  analysis  of 
variance  (ANOVA)  was  to  be  performed  on  the  ln-transformed  primary  PK  parameter  AUC0-inf.  The 
ANOVA was to include calculation of least-squares means (LSM) for the treatments. The ratios of LSM 
were  to  be  calculated  using  the  exponentiation  of  the  LSM  differences  from  the  analyses  on  the 
corresponding ln-transformed PK-parameters. The 90% CIs were to be calculated and back-transformed 
to the original scale. PK similarity was to be concluded if the respective CIs for AUC0-inf  were completely 
included in the similarity margin of 0.8000 to 1.2500. 
All PD analyses were to be performed on the relevant PD population. 
The  comparison  for  PD  similarity  regarding  the  primary  PD  endpoint  AUEC0-12w of  baseline-adjusted 
CD19+ and AUEC0-12w of α4-integrin %RS was considered the second step of the 2-step hierarchical 
testing  procedure.  The  data  of  US-licensed  Tysabri  and  EU-approved  Tysabri  were  planned  to  be 
combined/pooled for the comparison with PB006 if:  
• 
the  analytical  and  PK  bridge  has  demonstrated  similarity  between  US-licensed  Tysabri  and  EU-
approved Tysabri and 
the subsequently described predefined pooling criterion for the respective PD parameter (see further 
below) was fulfilled. 
• 
For the analysis of the primary PD endpoint AUEC0-12w of baseline-adjusted CD19+, an ANCOVA was 
to be performed on the ln-transformed PD parameter baseline-adjusted AUEC0-12w of baseline-adjusted 
CD19+. The ANCOVA model was to include the ln-transformed individual baseline value of CD19+ as 
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 42/149 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a covariate. The ANCOVA was to include calculation of LSM for the treatments. The ratios of LSM were 
to be calculated using the exponentiation of the LSM difference from the analyses on the ln-transformed 
PD parameter. The 90% and 95% CIs were to be back-transformed to the original scale. 
Predefined pooling criterion: 
The  ANCOVA  comparing  only  US-licensed  Tysabri  and  EU-approved  Tysabri  was  to  be  calculated  as 
described above for CD19+. If the 95% CI back-transformed baseline-adjusted AUEC0-12w of baseline-
adjusted CD19+ did not completely fall outside of [95.00%, 105.00%], the reference data was planned 
to  be  pooled  for  the  primary  analysis.  If  the  data  could  not  be  pooled,  the  unpooled  analysis  was 
planned to be presented. 
After the analytical and the PK bridge were established and the predefined pooling criterion for CD19+ 
was fulfilled, an ANCOVA model as described above was to be calculated comparing PB0006 and the 
pooled reference (US-licensed Tysabri and EU-approved Tysabri). 
Similarity was to be concluded if the 90% CI (for FDA) and 95% CI (for EMA) for baseline-adjusted 
AUEC0-12w of baseline-adjusted CD19+ was completely included in the similarity margin of 0.8000 to 
1.2500. 
The analysis of the primary PD endpoint AUEC0-12w of α4-integrin %RS was analogously performed to 
the analysis for AUEC0-12w of baseline-adjusted CD19+.

Recruitment 
For successful recruitment, two sequential screening visits were performed. At screening 1 (between day 
-56 and day -2), subjects had to be tested negative for JCV. Screening 2 was then performed between 
day  -28  and  day  -1  (admission).  Follow-up  was  performed  at  the  ambulatory  visit  on  day  85  (end  of 
study), and at an ambulatory visit on day 169 ±7 days (6 months). 
The first screening took place on 30 Oct 2019, the last follow-up was performed on 10 Mar 2021.

Baseline data 
A total of 450 subjects between 18 and 61 years of age and with a BMI between 18.6 and 30.3 kg/m2 
were dosed with the study drug in the study. 
Demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  were  similar  across  groups.  The  majority  of  subjects  were 
white. The ratio of males and females was balanced in all 3 groups. Mean age was 31 years, mean weight 
was approximately 72 kg and mean height was 172-173 cm across groups. Approximately half of the 
subjects in each group were in the weight class >65 kg to ≤80 kg.

The  difference  between  the  subjects  enrolled  before  and  after  the  study  stop  due  to  COVID-19  was 
limited  and  primarily  due  to  the  small  number  of  subjects  randomized  before  the  study  stop  (n=16) 
when compared to the number of subjects randomized after the study restart (n=434). 
In  the  PK Set,  437  subjects  between  18  and  61  years  of  age  and  with  a  BMI  between  18.6  and 30.3 
kg/m2 were included. There was no relevant difference between the demographics in the Safety Set and 
in the PK Set. 
In the PD Set (Other), 438 subjects between 18 and 61 years of age and a BMI between 18.6 and 30.3 
kg/m2 were included. In the PD Set (CD19+), 437 subjects between 18 and 61 years of age and a BMI 
between  18.6  and  30.3  kg/m2  were  included.  In  the  PD  Set  (Primary  α4-integrin %RS), 389 subjects 
between 18 and 61 years of age and a BMI between 18.7 and 30.3 kg/m2 were included. There were no 
relevant differences between the demographics in the Safety  Set  and those in  the PD Set  (Other), the 
PD Set (CD19+), or  the PD Set  (Primary  a-integrin %RS). 
Administration  of  the  study  drug  was  performed  by  the  Investigator  or  authorized  designee  as  an  IV 
infusion over 60 minutes. There was no indication of noncompliance based on observations during study 
drug  administration.  Compliance  was  further  confirmed  by  bioanalytical  assessment  of  natalizumab  in 
serum samples.  
Numbers analysed 
The PK Set consists of 437 subjects; 13 subjects were not included in the PK Set because they dropped 
out before the serum natalizumab levels approached LLOQ or they missed 2 or more consecutive visits 
before the serum natalizumab levels approached LLOQ. 
The  PD  Set  (CD19+)  consists  of  437  subjects;  13  subjects  were  not  included  in  the  PD  Set  (CD19+) 
because  they  dropped  out  before  the  CD19+  levels  returned  to  baseline  or  they  missed  3  or  more 
consecutive visits before the CD19+ levels returned to baseline. 
The PD Set (Primary α4-integrin %RS) consists of 389 subjects; 61 subjects were not included in the PD 
Set (Primary α4-integrin %RS) because they dropped out before the α4-integrin %RS levels returned to 
baseline,  samples  were  analyzed  outside  the  validation  stability  window,  or  they  missed  3  or  more 
consecutive visits before the α4-integrin %RS levels returned to baseline. 
The PD Set (Sensitivity α4-integrin %RS) consists of 432 subjects; 18 subjects were not included in the 
PD  Set  (Secondary  α4-integrin  %RS)  because  they  dropped  out  before  the  α4-integrin  %RS  levels 
returned  to  baseline  or  they  missed  3  or  more  consecutive  visits  before  the  α4-integrin  %RS  levels 
returned to baseline.

Outcomes and estimation 
A. Pharmacokinetic Results 
A1. Total natalizumab 
Concentration-time profiles of total natalizumab were similar in the 3 treatment groups over the entire 
sampling period. A rapid increase in total natalizumab was observed, with concentrations reaching nearly 
maximum  values  already  at  the  end  of  the  1-hour  infusion  period.  Concentrations  remained  high  (at 
values  of  around  60000  µg/L)  until  Day  3  and  subsequently  declined.  From  Day  57  onwards,  no 
natalizumab concentrations above the LLOQ were observed in any of the groups. 
Figure 2: Arithmetic mean (SD) plasma concentration-time profiles of total natalizumab (PK population) 
in study PB006-01-03, linear plot (left) and semi-log plot (right) 
The primary PK parameter was AUC0-inf of total natalizumab. For this parameter, a 3-way comparison 
was performed containing the comparison of PB006 to both US-Tysabri and EU-Tysabri, as well as the 
PK bridge between US-Tysabri and EU-Tysabri. The 3-way comparison was part of a hierarchical testing 
procedure. The hierarchical testing procedure foresees that subjects in the treatment arms receiving US-
Tysabri and EU-Tysabri, respectively, can be pooled for the primary PD analysis. As prerequisite for the 
Assessment report

pooling of the reference, PK similarity needs to be established and the pre-defined pooling criterion has 
to be fulfilled. Results from the statistical analysis are presented below. 
Table 7: Statistical analysis of the primary PK parameter AUC0-inf of total natalizumab (PK population) in 
study PB006-01-03 
AUC0-inf=area under the concentration time curve from time zero to infinity, CI=confidence interval, LS=least square, n=number of 
subjects with data available, PK=pharmacokinetic, vs=versus. The analysis was performed on natural log (ln) transformed parameters 
using an analysis of variance model with treatment as a fixed effect. Similarity could be concluded if the 90% CI fell completely in the 
margin of 0.80 to 1.25. 
PK  similarity  was  demonstrated  for  all  comparisons  (PB006  vs  EU-Tysabri,  PB006  vs  US-Tysabri,  EU-
Tysabri  vs  US-Tysabri).  For  all  pairwise  comparisons,  the  90%  CIs  were  completely  included  in  the 
similarity margin of 0.80 to 1.25. Thus, the primary PK endpoint was met. 
Cmax and AUC0-t of total natalizumab were secondary PK parameters and supportively evaluated in the 
same  manner  as  for  the  primary  analysis  using  AUC0-inf.  Results  from  this  statistical  analysis  are 
presented below.

population) in study PB006-01-03

analysis was performed on natural log (ln) transformed parameters using an analysis of variance model with treatment as a fixed 
effect. Similarity could be concluded if the 90% CI fells completely in 0.80 to 1.25. 
PK similarity was further supported by results from secondary endpoints. For both parameters (Cmax and 
AUC0-t) and for all comparisons (PB006 vs EU-Tysabri, PB006 vs US- Tysabri, EU-Tysabri vs US-Tysabri), 
the 90% CIs were completely included in 0.80 to 1.25.

The PK parameters tmax, t1/2 (half-life), CL (clearance), kel (terminal elimination rate constant) for total 
natalizumab  were  analyzed  descriptively.  A  summary  of  the  PK  parameters  for  total  natalizumab  is 
presented below.

AUC0-t)/  AUC0-inf)*100%,  CL=clearance,  Cmax=maximum  concentration,  CV=coefficient  of  variation,  kel=terminal  elimination  rate 
constant, N=number of subjects, n=number of subjects with data available, PK=pharmacokinetic, SD=standard deviation, t½=half-
life, tmax=time to Cmax, Vz=volume of distribution. 
PK parameters were similar for all 3 treatment groups. Geometric mean Cmax ranged from 68.6 to 71.7 
mg/L across groups, with CV being between 17.5% and 22.4%. Geometric mean AUC0-inf ranged from 
22118 to 23306 mg.h/L, with CV being between 23.5% and 25.2%. Median tmax was 12 hours for PB006 
and EU-Tysabri and 9 hours for US- Tysabri. Mean t1/2 ranged between 92.6 and 106 hours across groups. 
An AUCextra of 0.2% indicates that the duration of PK observation period has been sufficient. 
A2. Unexchanged natalizumab 
Concentration-time profiles of unexchanged natalizumab were similar in the 3 treatment groups over the 
entire sampling period. A rapid increase in unexchanged natalizumab was observed, with concentrations 
reaching near maximum values already at the end of the 1 hour infusion period. From Day 29 onwards, 
no  natalizumab  concentrations  above  the  LLOQ  were  observed  in  the  PB006  and  EU-Tysabri  groups, 
while  for  US-Tysabri  no  natalizumab  concentrations  above  the  LLOQ  were  observed  from  Day  22 
onwards.

The PK parameters Cmax, AUC0-inf and AUC0-t of unexchanged natalizumab were secondary endpoints and 
evaluated  as  supportive  evidence  (the  reported  CIs  were  of  exploratory  nature,  i.e.,  they  were  not 
assessed by pre-specified similarity margins). Results from the statistical analysis are presented below.

an analysis of variance model with treatment as a fixed effect. Similarity could be concluded if the 90% CI fell completely in 0.80 to 
1.25. 
For all 3 parameters similar results were seen for PB006, EU-Tysabri and US-Tysabri.

As  supportive  evidence,  the  PK  parameters  of  unexchanged  natalizumab  were  evaluated  in  the  same 
manner  as  described  for  total  natalizumab.  A  summary  of  the  PK  parameters  for  unexchanged 
natalizumab is presented below.

constant, N=number of subjects, n=number of subjects with data available, PK=pharmacokinetic, SD=standard deviation, t½=half-
life, tmax=time to Cmax, Vz=volume of distribution. 
PK parameters for unexchanged natalizumab were similar for all 3 treatment groups. 
A3. %Fab-arm exchange 
Natalizumab  is  a  full-length  antibody  of  the  IgG4  subclass.  It  consists  of  2  heavy  and  2  light  chains 
connected by 4 inter-chain disulfide bonds. Assessment of natalizumab in serum is complicated by the 
ability of human IgG4 antibodies to undergo Fab-arm exchange in vivo. Such exchange generates IgG4 
molecules of mixed specificity comprising a natalizumab heavy-light chain pair coupled to an endogenous 
IgG4 heavy-light chain pair of unknown specificity (Shapiro et al. 2011). 
Since exchanged and unexchanged species cannot be quantified independently using a single ELISA, a 
quantitation  strategy  was  developed  employing  2  ELISAs:  one  measuring  total  natalizumab  including 
both unexchanged (i.e., intact) and exchanged molecules, and the second measuring only unexchanged 
(intact) natalizumab. The presence and amount of exchanged natalizumab in serum was calculated by 
the  difference  in  values  obtained  in  the  2  assays.  This  approach  was  previously  developed  for 
quantification of Tysabri and is summarized in the article by Shapiro et al. in 2011. 
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 52/149 
 
 
 
 
 
Mean values for %Fab-arm exchange increased to >95% by Day 8 for PB006 (95.4%), EU- Tysabri 
(95.9%), and US-Tysabri (96.2%). Maximum values reached 100% in individual subjects at Day 8 for 
the 3 treatments. 
Overall, Fab-arm exchange was rapid and complete, with similar results for all 3 treatment groups.  
B. Pharmacodynamic Results 
B1. α4-integrin %RS 
The  α4-integrin  %RS  profiles  over  time  were  similar  in  all  treatment  groups.  Mean  α4-integrin  %RS 
increased to a level close to the maximum value (>90%) at the first postdose time point (6 hours) for 
all treatments.  
Figure  4:  Arithmetic  Mean  of  α4-integrin  %RS  Whole  Blood-Time  Profile  (PD  Set  [Primary  α4-
integrin %RS]) 
%RS=relative receptor saturation; IV=intravenous; N=number of subjects; RO=receptor occupancy; sd=single dose 
After  administration  of  3 mg/kg  PB006,  a  mean  maximum  response  of  92.6%  was  reached  after 
24 hours.  A  mean  α4-integrin  %RS  level  >80%  was  maintained  until  Day 29.  After  Day 29  the  α4-
integrin %RS value showed a decline to a value similar to the baseline value (<5% α4-integrin %RS) at 
Day 71.  
After administration of 3 mg/kg EU-approved Tysabri, a mean maximum response of 93.2% was reached 
on Day 5 (96 hours). A mean α4-integrin %RS level >80% was maintained until Day 29. After Day 29 
the α4-integrin %RS value showed a decline to a value similar to the baseline value at Day 71.  
After administration of 3 mg/kg US-licensed Tysabri, a mean maximum response of 93.1% was reached 
on Day 5 (96 hours). A mean α4-integrin %RS level >80% was maintained until Day 29. After Day 29 
the α4-integrin %RS value showed a decline to a value similar to the baseline value at Day 78.  
One of the 2 co-primary PD endpoints was AUEC0-12w for α4-integrin %RS. Similarity was concluded if 
the 90% CI and 95% CI for baseline-adjusted AUEC0-12w of α4-integrin %RS was completely included 
in the similarity margin of 0.80 to 1.25. 
The results from the primary PD analysis of α4-integrin %RS are presented in below table.

available, PD=pharmacodynamic, RS=receptor saturation. 
When  comparing  AUEC0-12w  of  α4-integrin  %RS  between  PB006  (test)  and  pooled  Tysabri  (reference) 
using an ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) model, the point estimates were close to 1 and the 95% CI 
for  the  geometric  LS  means  of  AUEC0-12w  was  narrow,  between  0.9523  and  1.0362.  The  95%  CI  was 
completely included in the similarity margin of 0.80 to 1.25. Thus, the primary PD endpoint α4-integrin 
%RS was met. 
Results for the individual comparisons (using 95% CIs), i.e., PB006 vs EU-Tysabri, PB006 vs US-Tysabri 
and EU-Tysabri vs US-Tysabri, are presented below.

For all comparisons, the point estimates were close to 1 and the 95% CIs were completely included in 
the similarity margin of 0.80 to 1.25. 
Additional analysis based on AUEC4-12w 
Mean  AUEC4-12w  was  an  additional  analysis  to  the  primary  analysis  of  α4-integrin  %RS  to  meet  EMA 
requirements.  Mean  AUEC4-12w  was  similar  for  the  3  treatments  at  approximately  40%  of  the  mean 
AUEC0-12w (compare Table 14 Table 15).  
Sensitivity Analysis for Samples Analyzed Outside the Validation Stability Window 
To assess the effect of the samples analyzed outside the validation stability window for α4-integrin %RS, 
the  PD  parameters  AUEC0-12w  and  AUEC4-12w  for  α4-integrin  %RS  were  also  calculated  including  all 
samples analyzed outside the validation stability window. 
Inclusion  of  samples  analyzed  outside  the  validation  stability  window  for  α4-integrin  %RS  (sensitivity 
analysis)  did  result  in  changes  in  the  values  for  AUEC0-12w  and  AUEC4-12w.  The  value  for  AUEC0-12w 
calculated  for  PB006  and  EU-approved  Tysabri  increased  1%  and  4%  and  for  US-licensed  Tysabri 
decreased 2%. The value for AUEC4-12w calculated for PB006 and EU-approved Tysabri increased 1% and

10% and for US-licensed Tysabri decreased less than 1% (Table 16). These changes were not expected 
to influence the outcome of the study.

B2. CD19+ 
The CD19+ profiles over time were similar in all treatment groups. Mean CD19+ levels increased rapidly 
after  administration  of  all  treatments.  At  the  first  postdose  time  point  (6 hours)  mean  CD19+  levels 
increased for all treatments. 
A time profile of mean CD19+ levels is presented below. 
Figure 5: Arithmetic Mean Change from Baseline CD19+ (106/L) Level - Time Profile (PD Set [CD19+]) 
IV=intravenous, N=number of subjects, sd=single dose, SD=standard deviation. 
For subjects receiving 3 mg/kg PB006, the mean absolute CD19+ level at baseline was 251 106/L. After 
6 hours  the  mean  CFB  was  111 106/L.  Baseline-adjusted  CD19+  levels  increased  further  to  reach  a 
maximum  mean  on  Day 8  (466 106/L).  From  Day 8  to  Day 29  baseline-adjusted  CD19+  levels  were 
stable (CFB >400 106/L) and started to decline from Day 36 onwards to return to baseline on Day 78 
(CFB 4 106/L).  
For subjects receiving 3 mg/kg EU-approved Tysabri, the mean absolute CD19+ level at baseline was 
255 106/L. After 6 hours the mean CFB was 115 106/L. A maximum mean CFB was reached on Day 15 
(489 106/L). From Day 15 to Day 29, baseline-adjusted CD19+ levels were stable (CFB >400 106/L) and 
started to decline from Day 36 onwards to return to baseline on Day 71 (CFB 14 106/L). 
For  subjects  receiving  3 mg/kg  US-licensed  Tysabri,  the  mean  absolute  CD19+  level  at  baseline  was 
266 106/L. After 6 hours the mean CFB was 106 106/L. A maximum mean CFB was reached on Day 15 
(496 106/L). From Day 15 to Day 29, baseline-adjusted CD19+ levels were stable (CFB >400 106/L) and 
started to decline from Day 36 onwards to return to baseline on Day 71 (CFB 12 106/L). 
AUEC0-12w for baseline-adjusted CD19+ was the co-primary PD parameter. Similarity was concluded if 
the  90%  CI  and  95%  CI  for  baseline-adjusted  AUEC0-12w  of  baseline-adjusted  CD19+  was  completely 
included in the similarity margin of 0.80 to 1.25. 
The results from the primary PD analysis of CD19+, based on 95% CIs, are presented below.

When  comparing  AUEC0-12w  of  baseline-adjusted  CD19+  between  PB006  (test)  and  pooled  Tysabri 
(reference) using an ANCOVA model, for all comparisons, the point estimates were close to 1 and the 
95% CI for the geometric LS means of AUEC0-12w was narrow, between 0.8955 and 1.1525. The 95% CI 
was completely included in the similarity margin of 0.80 to 1.25. Thus, the primary PD endpoint CD19+ 
was met. 
Results for the individual comparisons (using 95% CIs), i.e., PB006 vs EU-Tysabri, PB006 vs US-Tysabri 
and EU-Tysabri vs US-Tysabri, are presented in below table.

For all comparisons, the point estimates were close to 1 and the 95% CIs were completely included in 
the similarity margin of 0.80 to 1.25. 
For  the  secondary  PD  endpoint  baseline-adjusted  Emax  of  CD19+  geometric  mean  ratios  and 
corresponding 90% CI and 95% CI were calculated, following the same methodology as described for 
the primary PD endpoints. 
For the secondary PD endpoints baseline-adjusted Emax and tmax of CD19+ a descriptive evaluation was 
performed, and results based on 95% CIs are provided in Table 20. 
Results from the statistical analysis of baseline-adjusted Emax of CD19+ are presented below.

Note: AUEC0-12w and Emax of baseline-adjusted CD19+ cell counts were calculated as the area above zero following administration of 3 
mg/kg natalizumab until CD19+ values returned and crossed zero for the first time after Emax and the maximal change from baseline 
of CD19+ measurements, respectively 
Emax adjusted for baseline of CD19+ and tmax were secondary PD parameters. For Emax the changes from 
baseline were similar in the 3 treatment groups (mean of 612 to 615 x 106/L across groups). Median tmax 
was approximately 337 hours in all groups. 
B3. CD34+ 
The CD34+ profiles over time were similar in all treatment groups. 
After administration of 3 mg/kg PB006, mean absolute values for CD34+ increased from a predose value 
of 2.92x106/L to 4.43x106/L after 6 hours. Mean CD34+ values further increased to reach a maximum 
on Day 15 (10.18x106/L). After this maximum, mean CD34+ values decreased and returned to values 
similar to predose values by Day 78.

predose value of 2.65x106/L to 4.17 106/L after 6 hours. Mean CD34+ values further increased to reach 
a maximum on Day 15 (9.57x106/L). After this maximum mean CD34+ values decreased and returned 
to values similar to predose values by Day 85. 
AUEC0-t,  Emax,  and  tmax,E  for  CD34+  were  secondary  PD  endpoints,  and  a  descriptive  evaluation  was 
performed. A summary of these PD parameters for CD34+ is provided in below table.

Ancillary analyses 
COVID-19-Impact 
Plan 
Changes in conduct or analysis of the study due to COVID-19 were not considered at start of the study 
since the virus was not known by that time. 
In Amendment 3 (20 June 2020) of the study protocol, measures were described which were taken to 
protect subjects after dosing from a COVID-19 infection: 
1) Inclusion criteria: 
a.  Reduction of maximum inclusion age from 65 years reduced to 54 years before dosing 
b.  2 negative SAS-CoV-2 tests prior dosing 
2) Exclusion criteria: History or evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the last month prior screening 1 or 
having been in confirmed contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects in the last 2 weeks before dosing 
3) Inclusion of polymerase chain reaction [PCR] SARS-CoV-2 tests, update of ambulatory visit period 
and ambulatory activities, and increase of the in-house period 
4) Update of benefit/risk assessment of conduct of this study: The national multiple sclerosis society of 
the  USA,  as  per  the  website  information  published  on  their  website,  classifies  natalizumab  as  an 
immunomodulator rather than an immunosuppressant and states that treatment with natalizumab 
does not involve any greater risk for infection with e.g. SARS-CoV-2. Subjects in the trial also do not 
belong  to  potential  high-risk  groups.  The  risk  assessment  for  increase  of  serious  infections  is 
classified as both high impact and low possibility. 
Conduct & Outcome 
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the study was temporarily stopped on 16 Mar 2020. After approval of 
CSP Version 4.0 (dated 20 June 2020), study enrolment was resumed.  
Prior to the enrolment halt, the study had been started with 3 sites. Due to COVID-19 related recruitment 
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 62/149 
 
 
 
 
 
issues, 3 additional sites were included at the time enrolment was resumed. 
In  order  to  assess  the  impact  of  COVID-19  on  the  safety  in  this  study,  study  discontinuations  and 
protocol deviations due to COVID-19 were listed and summarized, if possible. 
To investigate whether there were differences between subjects completing the study prior to the study 
stop  and  subjects  completing  the  study  after  the  study  stop,  Tables,  Figures  and  Listings  (TFLs)  for 
demographics and AEs were also created on 2 subsets of the Safety Set:  
•  Pre-stop Safety Set: Subjects randomized to study intervention and dosed with study intervention 
and who completed the study before the study stop due to COVID-19 on 16 Mar 2020. 
•  Post-stop Safety Set: Subjects randomized to study intervention and dosed with study intervention 
and who completed the study after the study stop due to COVID-19 on 16 Mar 2020. 
Difference between the subjects in baseline characteristics enrolled before and after the study stop due 
to COVID-19 was limited and might be due to the small number of subjects randomized before the study 
stop (n=16) when compared to the number of subjects randomized after the study restart (n=434). 
Important  protocol  deviations  related  to  COVID-19  were  reported  for  5  subjects,  3  are  related  to 
compliance with quarantine requirements, and 2 are related to use of medication without consulting the 
Investigator.  
Before the study stop due to COVID-19, 25 TEAEs were reported for 10 subjects (63%) After the study 
stop due to COVID-19, 790 TEAEs were reported for 293 subjects (68%). Eleven (11) events of COVID-
19 were reported by 11 subjects (3%), 5 events by 5 subjects (3%) receiving 3 mg/kg PB006, 2 events 
by 2 subjects (1%) receiving 3 mg/kg EU-approved Tysabri, and 4 events by 4 subjects (3%) receiving 
3  mg/kg  US-licensed  Tysabri.  One  (1)  event  of  asymptomatic  COVID-19  was  reported  by  a  subject 
receiving US-licensed Tysabri. There was no difference in the nature and severity of the reported TEAEs. 
No subjects were withdrawn due to COVID-19. 
Absorption  
Since PB006 is developed as an IV solution, no clinical studies were conducted to evaluate bioavailability 
of the product.  
No specific food-interaction studies were performed. 
Distribution 
Volume  of  distribution  (Vz)  was  assessed  in  the  PK/PD  study  PB006-01-03.  The  PK  results  for  study 
PB006-01-03 are presented in more detail in the Bioequivalence section. PB006 had a mean Vz of 1262 
ml, Vz (EU-Tysabri) was 1198 ml and Vz (US-Tysabri) was 1164 ml. 
Elimination 
t1/2 and CL were assessed in the PK/PD study PB006-01-03. PB006 had a geometric mean t1/2 of 90.3 h, 
geometric mean t1/2 of EU-Tysabri and US-Tysabri were 87.6 h and 87.5 h, respectively. The geometric 
mean values for CL were 9.72 ml/h for PB006, 9.48 ml/h for EU-Tysabri, and 9.22 for US-Tysabri. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
The  applicant  conducted  two  pivotal  studies  to  investigate  the  clinical  similarity  between  PB006  and 
Tysabri, one single dose PK/PD study in healthy volunteers (PB006-01-03) and one multiple dose efficacy 
and safety study in patients with RRMS (PB006-03-01). The latter study included PK evaluation at steady 
state (Ctrough) but no assessment of PD was conducted in patients. 
Additionally, the applicant conducted a pilot study with Tysabri in healthy subjects (Tysabri Pilot-01-01). 
The purpose of this pilot study was the collection of PK/PD data with 3 different doses of EU-Tysabri to

establish  the  appropriately  sensitive  study  design  features  including  the  dose  selection  and  primary 
endpoints for the pivotal PK/PD study PB006-01-03. 
Besides the comparative PK and efficacy & safety evaluation conducted for this MAA, comparative PD 
assessed in study PB006-01-03 can be used to further support the clinical similarity assessment of PB006 
and Tysabri. 
Mechanism of action 
The Mechanism of Action of natalizumab is presented in the SmPC of the reference medicinal product 
EU-Tysabri (and referred to in the Dossier of Tyruko): 
Natalizumab is a selective adhesion-molecule inhibitor and binds to the α4-subunit of human integrins, 
which is highly expressed on the surface of all leukocytes, with the exception of neutrophils. Specifically, 
natalizumab binds to the α4β1 integrin, blocking the interaction with its cognate receptor, VCAM-1, and 
ligands osteopontin, and an alternatively spliced domain of fibronectin, CS-1. Natalizumab blocks the 
interaction  of  α4β7  integrin  with  the  MadCAM-1.  Disruption  of  these  molecular  interactions  prevents 
transmigration of mononuclear leukocytes across the endothelium into inflamed parenchymal tissue. A 
further  mechanism  of  action  of  natalizumab  may  be  to  suppress  ongoing  inflammatory  reactions  in 
diseased  tissues  by  inhibiting  the  interaction  of  α4-expressing  leukocytes  with  their  ligands  in  the 
extracellular matrix and on parenchymal cells. As such, natalizumab may act to suppress inflammatory 
activity present at the disease site, and inhibit further recruitment of immune cells into inflamed tissues. 
In MS, lesions are believed to occur when activated T-lymphocytes cross the BBB. Leukocyte migration 
across the BBB involves interaction between adhesion molecules on inflammatory cells and endothelial 
cells  of  the  vessel  wall.  The  interaction  between  α4β1  and  its  targets  is  an  important  component  of 
pathological  inflammation  in  the  brain  and  disruption  of  these  interactions  leads  to  reduced 
inflammation. Under normal conditions, VCAM-1 is not expressed in the brain parenchyma. However, 
in the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines, VCAM-1 is upregulated on endothelial cells and possibly 
on  glial  cells  near  the  sites  of  inflammation.  In  the  setting  of  CNS  inflammation  in  MS,  it  is  the 
interaction  of  α4β1  with  VCAM-1,  CS-1  and  osteopontin  that  mediates  the  firm  adhesion  and 
transmigration of leukocytes into the brain parenchyma and may perpetuate the inflammatory cascade 
in  CNS  tissue.  Blockade  of  the  molecular  interactions  of  α4β1  with  its  targets  reduces  inflammatory 
activity present in the brain in MS and inhibits further recruitment of immune cells into inflamed tissue, 
thus reducing the formation or enlargement of MS lesions. 
In the presented dossier for the Tyruko MAA, the applicant further describes the Mechanism of Action 
for natalizumab in the pathogenesis of MS: 
VCAM-1 is upregulated on brain microvascular endothelial cells in inflammatory CNS lesions of patients 
with MS (Benkert et al., 2012). As VCAM-1 is expressed on inflamed cerebrovascular endothelial cells, 
α4β1 is believed to be the critical target of natalizumab in preventing leukocyte migration into the CNS 
in MS (Selewski et al., 2010, “Natalizumab (Tysabri)”). 
MS is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS. It may take a relapsing-remitting or a 
chronic  progressive  clinical  course.  The  immigration  of  activated  T-lymphocytes  into  the  CNS  is 
fundamental to its pathogenesis. During disease development, CD4+ T-cells encounter environmental 
triggers of unknown kind in the periphery. This, in a widely accepted view, leads to activation of CNS 
antigen specific CD4+ T-cells in genetically susceptible individuals. These autoreactive T-cells then cross 
the BBB as effector T helper cells and initiate a chronic autoimmune disease (Benkert et al., 2012). 
Leucocyte migration across the BBB involves interaction between adhesion molecules on inflammatory 
cells  and  their  counter-receptors  present  on  endothelial  cells  of  the  vessel  wall.  The  clinical  effect  of 
Assessment report

natalizumab  in  multiple  sclerosis  may  be  secondary  to  blockade  of  the  molecular  interaction  of  α4β1 
integrin expressed by inflammatory cells with VCAM-1 on vascular endothelial cells, and with CS-1 and/or 
osteopontin expressed by parenchymal cells in the brain. In MS, the rationale for natalizumab therapy 
is the reduction of leukocyte migration into the CNS by specifically targeting α4β1, or very-late-activation 
antigen 4 (EMA Tysabri EPAR  –  Assessment  Report  –  Variation,  2013).  VCAM  is  induced  on  venular 
endothelium in inflammation, including in brain in experimental autoimmune encephalitis. Natalizumab, 
as an antibody to α4β1, blocks lymphocyte emigration into the brain, α4β1 dependent co-stimulation of 
immune responses, and EAE. Consequently, α4β1  and not α4β7 is the critical target for  experimental 
autoimmune encephalitis (Yu et al., 2013, “How Natalizumab Binds and Antagonizes α4 Integrins”).

applicant in order to characterise the PK and PD profiles of the reference medicinal product EU-Tysabri. 
Further, the study aimed to assess and compare the Fab-arm exchange of EU-Tysabri, and to assess the 
safety of EU-Tysabri. The study is briefly summarised below, with a focus on PD of natalizumab. 
Study Design 
Tysabri  Pilot-01-01  was  a  single-centre,  single-dose,  randomized,  double-blind,  3-arm  parallel-group 
study in 36 healthy male and female subjects. Subjects were randomized to one of 3 dose groups and 
treated  with  single  doses  of  EU-Tysabri.  The  study  schedule  included  2  screening  visits  prior  to  drug 
administration, a clinic period from Day -1 to approximately 48 hours after drug administration and 11 
ambulatory visits, on Day 5, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 57, 71, 78, and 85. An additional follow-up visit was 
performed 6 months after drug administration, to assess potential neurological symptoms which could 
suggest PML. Safety was monitored throughout the study by repeated clinical and laboratory evaluations. 
Samples for assessments of PK, PD and immunogenicity were collected up to Day 85. 
Healthy male and female subjects aged 18 to 65 years at screening, with a body weight of 50.0 to 110.0 
kg, a BMI of 18.5 to 32.0 kg/m2, and JCV antibody negative were eligible to the study. Randomisation 
was stratified by body weight class (50.0 - 70.0 kg, 70.1 - 90.0 kg, 90.1 - 110.0 kg). No formal sample 
size calculation was performed. 
Subjects were randomised to three treatment arms and received a single, 60-minute, IV dose of 1, 3, 
or 6 mg/kg EU-Tysabri (N=12 for each arm). 
Blood  samples  for  assessment  of  PD  parameters  were  collected  pre-dose  and  6  hours  after  start  of 
infusion on Day 1, and on Days 2, 5, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 57, 71, 78 and 85. 
The PD variables included sMAdCAM, sVCAM, α4-integrin %RS, cell counts for CD34+, CD19+, CD3+, 
CD3+CD8+,  CD3+CD4+,  CD3-CD16+CD56+,  CD10+CD19+.  For  α4-integrin  %RS,  sVCAM  and 
sMadCAM,  and  for  all  lymphocyte  cell  counts  the  following  PD  parameters  were  calculated:  The  PD 
parameters  were  AUEC0-12w  and  AUEC4-12w,  Emax  and  time  to  Emax  (Tmax,  E).  The  PD  parameters  were 
estimated on the absolute values, using a noncompartmental model. The linear trapezoidal interpolation 
method for AUEC calculation was used. Per an addendum to the SAP, geometric CV was added to the PD 
levels and parameter tables, and ANOVA was performed for relative α4-integrin %RS and CD19+ using 
the SAS procedure for mixed effect models (with treatments as fixed effects). 
The analysis of PD levels was based on the safety population, defined as all subjects who received study 
medication. The analysis of PD parameters was based on the PD population, defined as all subjects who 
have received the dose of study medication and provided sufficient bioanalytical assessment results to 
calculate reliable estimates of the PD parameters. 
The demographics and baseline characteristics are described in the following table.

PD Results 
For  α4-integrin  (%)RS  a  clear  dose  response  relationship  was  observed  across  the  tested  doses, 
indicating good dynamic range of the PD marker. The increase in AUEC0-12w was approximately 1.7-fold 
for the dose increase from 1 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg, and approximately 1.3-fold for the dose increase from 
3 mg/kg to 6 mg/kg (based on geometric mean values). With regard to variability, the geometric CV for 
AUEC0-12w ranged from 18.5% (with 1 mg/kg) to 27.7% (with 3 mg/kg). Overall, these results were the 
prerequisite for setting up the sensitive PD assessment in the pivotal study PB006-01-03 and based on 
these results, the 3 mg/kg dose was selected. 
CD19+ B-cell counts increased in a sensitive and dose-dependent way upon natalizumab exposure. A 
clear dose response relationship was observed across the tested doses, indicating good dynamic range 
of the PD marker. The increase in AUEC0-12w change from baseline was approximately 1.8-fold for the 
dose increase from 1 to 3 mg/kg, and approximately 1.4-fold for the dose increase from 3 to 6 mg/kg 
(based on geometric mean values). The variability was high, with geometric CV being between 50.6% 
(for 6 mg/kg) and 101.4% (for 1 mg/kg). Based on these results, the 3 mg/kg dose was selected as a 
sensitive dose for the pivotal PK/PD study PB006-01-03. 
CD34+ cell counts increased in a dose dependent way across the tested doses, indicating good dynamic 
range of the PD marker. The increase for AUEC0-12w was approximately 1.7-fold for the dose increase 
from  1  to  3  mg/kg,  and  approximately  1.5-fold  for  the  dose  increase  from  3  to  6  mg/kg  (based  on 
geometric  mean  values).  Variability  was  high,  with  geometric  CV  between  44.0%  (for  1  mg/kg)  and 
68.7% (for 3 mg/kg). 
For sVCAM, a clear dose response relationship was observed across the tested doses, indicating good 
dynamic range of the PD marker. The increase in AUEC0-12w below baseline effect was approximately 2.0-

fold for the dose increase from 1 to 3 mg/kg, and approximately 1.3-fold for the dose increase from 3 
to 6 mg/kg (based on geometric mean values). With regard to variability, geometric CVs ranged between 
33.9 and 71.2%. 
Also for sMAdCAM, a clear dose response relationship was observed across the tested doses, indicating 
good dynamic range of the PD marker. The increase in AUEC0-12w below baseline effect was approximately 
1.7-fold for the dose increase from 1 to 3 mg/kg, and approximately 1.6-fold for the dose increase from 
3  to  6  mg/kg  (based  on  geometric  mean  values).  With  regard  to  variability,  geometric  CVs  ranged 
between 38.9 and 54.8%. 
The  additionally  tested  PD  parameters  CD3+,  CD3+CD4+,  CD3+CD8+,  CD3-CD16+56+,  and 
CD10+CD19+ cells were found to not be dose dependent and thus not sensitive to detect differences in 
efficacy. These parameters were hence not included in the pivotal PK/PD study PB006-01-03. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology programme for the natalizumab biosimilar candidate PB006 comprises data 
from two studies: the bulk of data for the biosimilarity exercise in PK and PD was generated in the pivotal 
phase 1 PK/PD study PB006-01-03, which investigated biosimilarity between PB006 and both EU- and 
US-sourced  Tysabri  in  healthy  subjects  (N=453).  Further,  trough  concentrations  and  immunogenicity 
were assessed in a pivotal phase 3 study (“efficacy study” PB006-03-01). 
The primary objective of the pivotal PK/PD study was the demonstration of similarity in the PK and PD 
profiles. In this study, one primary PK endpoint as well as two co-primary PD endpoints were used. The 
study  design  and  study  population  were  appropriate.  It  is  noted  that  for  the  scope  of  this  MAA,  the 
comparison  of  the  biosimilar  candidate  and  EU-Tysabri  is  considered  of  higher  regulatory  significance 
than the comparison with US-Tysabri. 
The  analytical  methods  have  been  adequately  validated;  all  issues  identified  have  been  addressed  by 
the applicant and are considered solved. 
A  population  of  healthy  subjects  was  included  which  is  appropriate  to  detect  potential  differences 
between the two treatments since variability is minimised and the mode of action is the same in healthy 
subjects and patients. In addition, inclusion of only healthy volunteers who were shown to be negative 
for anti-JCV antibodies as a measure to minimise the risk for PML, is in line with the scientific advice. 
Stratification was performed according to the body weight class (50 kg to 65 kg, >65 kg to 80 kg, >80 
kg to 92 kg) to ensure balance across the study arms, because according to Tysabri EPAR, body weight 
was found to influence the natalizumab disposition. 
The study protocol was amended at several time points, with extensive changes to its design, including 
the primary  endpoints, sample size, study population, conduct  of the study  (introduction of a pooling 
criterion to allow pooling of results of EU- and US-Tysabri for PD evaluation), and evaluation of study 
results. Some changes were introduced in response to the worldwide SARS-CoV-2 outbreak (including 
the inclusion of three additional sites), which took place during the early stages of the study and led to 
a temporary study halt. 
Amendments to the primary PD endpoints were made. In the original study protocol, AUEC4-12wk of α4-
integrin  RS  was  specified.  This  endpoint  was  agreed  during  EMA  scientific  advice.  Use  of  the  partial 
AUEC4-12wk  was  reasoned  with  rapid  and  strong  induction  of  the  marker  immediately  following 
administration  of  natalizumab.  Since  receptor  saturation  was  high  (near  max  saturation  levels)  until 
around  the  4  week  mark,  exclusion  of  the  first  4  weeks  leads  to  increased  sensitivity  of  the  marker. 
However, the endpoint was replaced by AUEC0-12wk α4-integrin RS in the final amendment, for reasons 
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 67/149 
 
 
 
of  harmonisation  across  regulatory  regions.  AUEC4-12wk  α4-integrin  RS  was  planned  as  an  additional 
supportive  analysis.  In  the  original  study  protocol,  AUEC0-t  and  Emax  of  CD19+  B-cells  were  specified. 
However, these endpoints were downgraded to secondary endpoints with the first amendment. With the 
final amendment, AUEC0-12wk of CD19+ cells was reintroduced. 
While  the  addition  of  a  co-primary  PD  marker  acting  downstream  of  the  receptor  was  advised  during 
EMA scientific advice and is endorsed, no scientific justification of the CD19+ B-cells in terms of PD was 
provided with the documentation, and a discussion of the relevance of the marker was requested from 
the  applicant.  In  said  discussion,  the  applicant  acknowledged  that  the  CD19+  B-cell  count  does  not 
qualify as a surrogate endpoint. Since the applicant does not aim to derive clinical relevance from the 
PD characterisation and the clinical efficacy assessment is informed by data generated in a dedicated 
efficacy study in a patient population, the omission to provide an adequate justification for the clinical 
relevance of the selected PD endpoint does not impede assessment of biosimilarity and the concern is 
therefore not further pursued. 
In the initial submission, the additional pre-specified analysis of receptor saturation AUEC4-12wk of α4-
integrin %RS was missing and the descriptive results presented  were apparently based on the safety 
set, instead of the pre-specified RS/RO main analysis AUEC4-12wk set. The applicant was asked to provide 
the  correct  analysis  and  no  concerns  arise  from  the  submitted  data.  Also  the  unpooled  sensitivity 
analyses for AUEC0-12 α4-integrin RS were requested and the data provided raised no concerns.  
One  methodological  concern  pertains  to  potentially  jeopardised  trial  integrity,  as  any  potential  data-
driven planning of important design aspects (choice of PD endpoints, option for pooling of reference data, 
etc) may have a non-negligible impact on trial outcome interpretation. Due to the extensive character 
of the amendments relatively late into the study, a description/overview of the chronological sequence 
of relevant trial milestones was submitted by the applicant. Measures taken to reflect the late changes 
in the trial in the randomisation process were described by the applicant. Although many changes were 
made during study conduct, no severe impact on study integrity could be identified.  
Biosimilarity  in  PK  of  PB006  and  EU-authorised  and  US-sourced  Tysabri  was  demonstrated  following 
single dose IV infusion of 3 mg/kg natalizumab, as the 90% CIs for the ratio of geometric LS means for 
the primary PK endpoint AUC0-inf of total natalizumab of PB006 and EU- (and US-) sourced Tysabri were 
completely  within  the  acceptance  interval  of  0.8  –  1.25.  This  result  was  supported  by  the  results 
presented  for  the  secondary  endpoints  regarding  total  natalizumab  (AUC0-t,  Cmax),  and  unexchanged 
natalizumab  (AUC0-inf,  AUC0-t,  Cmax,  tmax).  Tmax  of  total  natalizumab  supported  biosimilarity  between 
PB006 and EU-Tysabri, but a difference was noted for the US-sourced comparator. This however does 
not  raise  concerns,  given  the  higher  regulatory  significance  of  the  comparison  with  EU-Tysabri.  The 
primary and secondary PK endpoints as well as the equivalence margin (80-125%) used are in line with 
the “Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies – non-clinical 
and clinical issues” (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). 
For PB006 and EU-Tysabri, the ratio of geometric LS means for the primary PK endpoint AUC0-inf of total 
natalizumab  was 0.9864  (90% CI: 0.9410,  1.0340), for AUC0-t of total natalizumab 0.9840 (90% CI: 
0.9387,  1.0316),  and  for  Cmax  0.9565  (90%  CI:  0.9215,  0.9929).  Therefore,  bioequivalence  can  be 
concluded from the results of the primary PK endpoint. The results of the PK secondary analyses support 
the results of the primary PK analysis. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics (mean age, body weight, height, BMI) were balanced between 
the three treatment arms. Slightly more men than women were recruited in the PB006  group (males 
53%) compared to both Tysabri groups (EU-Tysabri: 46.4% males, US-Tysabri: 47.3% males). Race of 
participants and body weight classes were well balanced between treatment arms.

In study PB006-03-01 after repeated administration, the Ctrough concentrations were similar in the PB006 
and Tysabri groups at all post-baseline timepoints for both FAS and PP populations. 
Certificate of analyses for the biosimilar candidate batch No. P79303A, EU-Tysabri batch 1424913 and 
batch  No.  1425561,  US-Tysabri  batch  No.  SP0118  used  in  the  clinical  trial  PB006-01-03  have  been 
provided. As the regulatory decision regarding the biosimilarity is based on the comparability between 
the  biosimilar  candidate  PB006  and  EU-Tysabri,  for  which  certificates  of  analysis  contained  all  the 
relevant parameters, the issue is not further pursued. 
For the demonstration of biosimilarity in PD, two co-primary endpoints were used: AUEC0-12wk α4-integrin 
% RS and AUEC0-12wk of the baseline-adjusted CD19+ cell fraction. Both co-primary endpoints were met, 
as  the  95%  CIs  for  the  ratio  of  geometric  LS  means  for  the  co-primary  PD  endpoints  AUEC0-12wk  α4-
integrin %RS and AUEC0-12wk baseline-adjusted CD19+ were completely within a predefined interval of 
0.8 – 1.25.  
For PB006 and EU-Tysabri, the ratio of geometric LS means for AUEC0-12wk α4-integrin % RS was 1.0142 
(95% CI: 0.9667, 1.0641). The ratio for the comparison against pooled EU- and US-Tysabri was 0.9933 
(95% CI: 0.9523, 1.0362). 
For PB006 and EU-Tysabri, the ratio of geometric LS means of AUEC0-12wk of baseline-adjusted CD19+ 
was 1.0163 (95% CI: 0.8787, 1.1754). The ratio for the comparison against pooled EU- and US-Tysabri 
was 1.0159 (95% CI: 0.8955, 1.1525). 
Although the EMA/CHMP scientific advice recommended to update the primary endpoint to the partial 
AUEC4-12W of the  α4-integrin receptor  saturation to use the most sensitive part of the curve to detect 
differences  between  the  reference  product  and  the  biosimilar  candidate  as  primary  endpoint  for 
evaluating biosimilarity, the applicant did not follow the scientific advice.  
The EMA/CHMP scientific advice recommended to include additional true PD markers (e.g., lymphocyte 
count  measurements,  lymphocyte  subset  analysis,  sVCAM-1  concentration  measurements,  sMADCAM 
concentrations) to provide further supportive PD evidence, as α4-integrin RS over time is not a true PD 
marker since it merely reflects occupancy of the receptor rather than translation into an effect. Thus, 
secondary  endpoints  measured  in  study  PB006-01-03,  i.e.,  Emax,  tmax  of  baseline  adjusted  CD19+, 
AUECbase_neg,  Emin,  tmin  of  sVCAM  and  of  sMAdCAM,  and  AUEC0-t,  Emax,  tmax  of  CD34+  are  considered 
adequate. 
A mean maximum response of α4-integrin %RS of 92.6% was observed more rapidly after administration 
of 3 mg/kg PB006 (24 hours) as compared to administration of 3 mg/kg Tysabri EU (93.2% on Day 5 
(96 hours)) and of 3 mg/kg Tysabri US (93.1% on Day 5 (96 hours)). 
The use of 95% CI for primary PD parameters is considered adequate. However, the used equivalence 
margins (80-125%) for assessment of PD endpoints were criticised during EMA scientific advice provided 
prior to study initiation as being too wide. Also, no sound scientific justification for the acceptance ranges 
was  found  in  the  documentation.  The  applicant  was  therefore  asked  to  provide  a  justification  for  the 
equivalence  margins  of  0.8  –  1.25  used  for  all  PD  endpoints.  In  the  responses,  the  applicant 
acknowledged that none of the PD endpoints are sufficiently associated with a clinical endpoint and hence 
did  not  provide  a  clinical  justification  of  the  pre-specified  acceptance  margin.  Given  that  in  the 
developmental  programme  of  Tyruko  efficacy  data  were  generated  which  are  considered  adequate  to 
enable  assessment  of  biosimilarity,  this  lack  of  clinical  justification  does  not  impede  conclusions  on 
biosimilarity, and the issue is therefore not further pursued. 
The secondary PD endpoints (Emax and tmax of baseline-adjusted CD19+, AUECbase_neg, Emin, tmin of sVCAM 
and sMAdCAM, AUEC0-t, Emax, tmax of CD34+) were overall supportive of biosimilarity between PB006 and 
EU-  (and  US-)Tysabri.  With  the  exception  of  sVCAM  AUECbase-neg  (ratio:  1.1276;  95%  CI:  0.9700, 
Assessment report

1.2852), the 95% CIs of the PB006 and EU-Tysabri ratios were contained within a 0.8 – 1.25 interval for 
all secondary parameters. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
From the presented data on PK and PD, biosimilarity between the biosimilar candidate PB006 and EU-
Tysabri can be concluded.

•  Treatments 
Treatments Administered 
The  test  drug,  PB006,  biosimilar  natalizumab,  is  a  concentrate  for  solution  for  IV  infusion.  PB006  is 
provided in an alternative formulation to Tysabri, based on well-established excipients and containing 
the same concentration of natalizumab as the reference (comparator) product. 
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 71/149 
 
 
 
The comparator product, Tysabri (natalizumab), is a concentrate for solution for IV infusion. 
Each 15 mL vial of concentrate contained 300 mg natalizumab (20 mg/mL). Both study drugs were to 
be  diluted  with  100  mL  sodium  chloride  solution  (0.9%),  resulting  in  a  natalizumab  concentration  of 
approximately 2.6 mg/mL for administration. The diluted solution was to be infused intravenously over 
1 hour at a rate of approximately 2 mL/minute (115 mL total infusion volume).  
Eligible patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous 
infusions  every  4  weeks  of  either  PB006  or  Tysabri  at  a  dose  of  300  mg  starting  at  Visit  1  (Week  0) 
through Visit 12 (Week 44), for a total of 12 infusions. Patients re-randomized and switched from Tysabri 
to  PB006  at  Week  24  still  received  a  total  of  12  infusions  (6  infusions  of  Tysabri  and  6  infusions  of 
PB006).

Efficacy assessments included evaluation of lesions (assessed by MRI), and relapse rate and disability 
status (assessed by the Kurtzke EDSS).  
For the primary endpoint, the applicant selected an equivalence margin for the mean difference of 2.1 
lesions to ensure that 50% of the treatment effect based on the lower bound of the 95% CI of the pooled 
effect size estimated in a controlled trial of natalizumab for RMS (Miller et al., 2003) would be preserved. 
Assessment  of  lesions  was  performed  using  MRI  with  contrast  agents.  Brain  MRI  scans  to  provide 
radiologic response data for assessing lesions were to be performed at each site. All MRI scans were to 
be assessed by the MRI central reading center, with the exception of the brain MRI scans for the PML 
Follow-up Visits, which were to be assessed locally, only. 
A  macrocyclic  Gd-based  contrast  agent  (gadobutrol,  gadoteric  acid,  or  gadoteridol)  was  to  be 
administered as an IV infusion of 0.1 mmol/kg.  
If PML was clinically suspected from Visit 1 through the End-of-Study Visit or Early Discontinuation Visit, 
the local radiologist was to alert the Investigator, who was to schedule an Unscheduled Suspected PML 
Visit with the patient within 3 days. MRI scans were to be reviewed immediately by the central reading 
center. The results of the review were to be communicated to the site, Sponsor, and CRO immediately.  
If PML was suspected after the End-of-Study Visit or Early Discontinuation Visit, a PML Follow-up Visit 
was to be scheduled. 
A relapse was defined as the appearance of a new neurological abnormality or worsening of previously 
stable or improving pre-existing neurological abnormality, separated by at least 30 days from onset of 
a preceding clinical demyelinating event. The abnormality had to be present for at least 24 hours and 
have occurred in the absence of fever (<37.5 °C) or infection. 
In the event of a relapse, the study-related MRI scans were to be obtained before corticosteroid therapy 
was initiated. If this could not be done, the MRI scan was to be taken 14 days or more after the last 
corticosteroid dose. MRI scans were to be reviewed by the MRI central reading center. 
The Kurtzke EDSS, commonly used to evaluate the degree of neurologic impairment in MS, is an ordinal 
clinical  rating  scale  ranging  from  0  (normal  neurologic  examination)  to  10  (death  due  to  MS)  in  half-
point increments. Based on a standard neurological examination, the 7 functional systems (plus “other”) 
are rated. These ratings are then used in conjunction with observations and information concerning gait 
and  use  of  assistive  devices  to  rate  the  EDSS.  EDSS  ratings  were  to  be  performed  by  independent 
examining neurologists.

Safety assessments included AEs (adverse events), physical examinations, ECG, vital signs, laboratory 
evaluations,  Columbia-Suicide  Severity  Rating  Scale,  anti-natalizumab  antibodies,  and  anti-JCV 
antibodies. 
•  Sample size 
A total of 230 evaluable patients (115 in each group), i.e., patients who complete the 24-week treatment 
period  without  relevant  major  protocol  deviations  and  for  whom  sufficient  postbaseline  MRI  data  are 
available, were seen required to achieve 90% power for the equivalence assessment with respect to the 
cumulative  number  of  new  active  lesions  over  24  weeks  treatment,  assuming  a  common  standard 
deviation of 4.0 lesions and no difference between both groups. To account for potential dropouts and 
non-evaluable  patients  of  up  to  10%,  approximately  260  patients  were  planned  to  be  randomized  to 
either Tysabri or PB006. The sample size calculation was based on data published by Miller et al., 2003, 
which showed a mean number of cumulative new active lesions of 1.0 (±2.6) in the pooled natalizumab 
groups (3 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg) versus 9.7 (±27.4) in the placebo group in patients with either RRMs or 
secondary progressive MS. An equivalence margin of 2.1 lesions was chosen to ensure that 50% of the 
treatment effect, based on the lower bound of the 95% CI of the pooled effect size estimated in Miller 
et al., 2003, was preserved. 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Investigators were required to register all patients who sign the inform consent form (ICF) in the eCRF 
with the date the ICF was signed. The Investigator/designee was planned to obtain a patient number 
using an electronic data capture (EDC) system. Patients who did not meet eligibility criteria were to be 
registered as screen failures in the eCRF along with the date and reason for screen failure. Patients who 
meet  all  eligibility  requirements  and  who  have  signed  an  ICF  were  planned  to  be  randomly  assigned 
(using the eCRF Randomization Form) to one of the two treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization 
was planned to be stratified by the following factors at Screening: 
• Absence/presence of GdE lesions (0, >0) 
• Presence of T2 lesions (≤15, >15) 
• JCV status for safety (negative, positive) 
The randomization of eligible patients was to be done dynamically using Medidata Randomization and 
Trial  Supply  Management  integrated  with  the  EDC  (Rave).  Some  further  details  of  the  dynamic 
randomization  were  provided  in  a  separate  Randomisation  Plan,  which  refers  to  the  “Rave  RTSM  and 
EDC Integration Specification” (which is not accessible via the submitted dossier). 
At Week 24, the 130 patients in the Tysabri group were planned to be re-randomized. Approximately 34 
patients were to be randomized (switched) to PB006.  
For a subset of patients (n=62), stratification data used for randomization was incorrectly entered at the 
study sites and was corrected after finalization of the CSR Version 1.0. 25 sites across all participating 
countries  were  affected.  The  errors  were  distributed  across  all  three  stratification  factors: 
absence/presence  of  GdE  lesions  (20  errors),  presence  of  T2  lesions  (16  errors),  and  JCV  status  (38 
errors). The applicant provided a separate memo describing all relevant details regarding these errors, 
including a root cause analysis. As a corrective measure, additional sensitivity analysis of the primary 
analysis using corrected strata was planned to be performed. 
This study was planned to run double-blinded with regard to the study drug. An unblinded pharmacist/ 
designee was planned to be responsible for maintaining accountability, blinding, and dispensing the study 
drugs according to the handling instructions. Study center personnel, with the exception of the unblinded 
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 74/149 
 
 
 
pharmacist/designee, were planned to remain blinded to the identity of the study drug until the database 
was locked and the study was unblinded. 
To maintain investigator blinding, the treatment code was not be broken except in medical emergencies 
when the appropriate management of the patient required knowledge of the treatment randomization. 
In these cases, the patient was supposed to receive all appropriate medical care. Prior to any unblinding, 
the  Investigator  was  supposed  to  contact  the  Medical  Monitor  to  discuss  options.  The  unblinding 
procedure was to be done through the interactive Web response system. As soon as possible and without 
revealing the patient’s study drug assignment (unless important to the safety of patients remaining in 
the study), the Investigator was to notify the Sponsor if the blind was broken for any reason and the 
Investigator was unable to contact the Sponsor prior to unblinding. 
The Sponsor was allowed to break the code for Serious AEs (SAE) that were unexpected and believed to 
be  causally  related  to  study  drug,  and  that  potentially  required  expedited  reporting  to  regulatory 
authorities. In such cases, the minimum number of Sponsor personnel were to be unblinded. Treatment 
codes were not to be broken for the planned analyses of data until all decisions on the evaluability of the 
data from each individual patient had been made and documented and databases had been locked. 
•  Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
Safety population 
Patients who received at least 1 (complete or partial) infusion of the study drug were to be included in 
the Safety Population (SAF). Patients in this group were to be analyzed as treated. 
Safety-switch population 
Patients who were included in the SAF Population and received at least 1 infusion of the study drug after 
the timepoint of re-randomization, independent of whether they switched or not, were to be included in 
the  Safety-Switch  Population  (SSW).  Patients  in  this  group  were  to  be  analyzed  as  treated  after  re-
randomization, also considering treatment before re-randomization. 
Full analysis set 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) Population was to include all patients who were randomized and received at 
least 1 (complete or partial) infusion of the study drug. Patients were to be analyzed according to the 
treatment group to which they were randomized. 
Per-Protocol population 
Only  patients  participating  in  this  study  who  completed  the  24-week  treatment  period  without  major 
protocol deviations that may have influenced the analysis of the primary endpoint and for whom sufficient 
post-baseline  MRI  data  were  available  (including  baseline,  Week  24  and  at  least  1  out  of  the  3  other 
scheduled MRI visits) were to be included in the PP Population. The final decision on the PP-Population 
was to be made in the blinded data review meeting before database lock for the final analysis of the 
primary endpoint. 
In addition, a pre-COVID PP Population defined as all PP patients, including those who were excluded 
from PP only due to major deviations related to COVID-19, was planned.  
General statistical considerations 
Data collected in this study were to be presented in subject data listings and summary tables.  
Descriptive statistics (number of patients with non-missing values, mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum) were to be presented for continuous variables.  
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 75/149 
 
 
 
Frequency distributions (counts and percentages) were to be presented for categorical variables.  
Demographics  (age,  sex,  race,  ethnicity,  and  child-bearing  potential)  and  baseline  characteristics 
(weight, height, and BMI) were to be summarized by treatment group. 
Medical  history  (conditions  that  ended  before  the  date  of  screening)  and  current  medical  conditions 
(those that started before and were ongoing at screening) were to be coded using the MedDRA v23.0 
and tabulated by System Organ Class and Preferred Term and by treatment group. MS disease history 
data were to be summarized. 
Use of prior medications (stopped before treatment started) and concomitant medications (ongoing at 
treatment start or started after first study treatment) were coded and tabulated by treatment group on 
the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical 2, ATC 4, and preferred name levels. 
MS-related treatment history was planned to be tabulated. Study drug exposure data was also planned 
to  be  summarised  descriptively.  Natalizumab  trough  concentration  in  serum  were  planned  to  be 
summarized descriptively per time point in the FAS and PP population. 
Primary efficacy analysis 
The primary analysis was to be based on the PP Population. The primary endpoint was the cumulative 
number of new active lesions over 24 weeks. Similarity between PB006 and Tysabri was to be assessed 
based on the following set of hypotheses: 
H0: |μPB006 – μTysabri| > 2.1 vs. H1: |μPB006 – μTysabri| ≤ 2.1 
The  term  μx  denotes  the  cumulative  number  of  new  active  lesions  over  24  weeks  in  the  respective 
treatment group. Data were to be analyzed using a negative binomial generalized linear model with fixed 
effects for the treatment group and stratification factors with log link on the PP Population. Parameters 
were to be estimated using a maximum likelihood approach and back-transformed to the original scale. 
Similarity was to be tested based on the corresponding 95% CI. An equivalence margin for the mean 
difference of 2.1 lesions was chosen and prespecified to ensure that 50% of the treatment effect based 
on the lower bound of the 95% CI of  the assumed effect size (estimate  derived from literature data) 
would be preserved. 
Sensitivity analyses for primary efficacy comparisons 
Analysis in the Full Analysis Set 
As  one  sensitivity  analysis,  the  primary  analysis  was  to  be  repeated  for  the  FAS  Population.  For  this 
purpose, data from early discontinuation MRIs (i.e., End-of-Study Visits that occurred before or after the 
protocol-scheduled timepoint) were to be incorporated into the derived cumulative endpoint (i.e., all MRI 
results at all previous visits until the specific timepoint were to be summed and used for analysis). The 
cumulative sum of measurements from prior timepoints was to be used for analysis at other timepoints 
with missing MRI results. For intermittent missing MRI results (i.e., missed MRI visits but with MRI data 
collected at subsequent visits), no imputation was to be done. This process was to ensure that lesions 
from missed MRI screening visits were identified at later MRI screenings. 
To assess the effect of missing values in this study, one further sensitivity analysis based on the FAS 
Population was to be carried out using a multiple imputation method. One hundred data sets were to be 
created using a linear regression model with predictive variables including  treatment, all stratification 
variables,  sex,  age,  height,  and  weight  at  baseline,  and  the  number  of  relapses  the  year  prior  to 
Screening.  All  available  data,  including  early  discontinuation  data,  were  to  be  used  for  analysis.  Only 
post-baseline timepoints with completely missing MRI data and no subsequent MRI screening (monotone 
missing) were to be imputed. No imputation was to be done for baseline measurements. Imputation was 
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 76/149 
 
 
 
to be done only for patients with baseline and at least 1 post-baseline MRI result. Sensitivity analyses 
were to be performed for the primary endpoint using the negative binomial model described in the SAP.  
Analysis with corrected stratification information 
As  a  corrective  measure  of  the  stratification  error  (described  and  assessed  above)  an  additional 
sensitivity analysis of the primary analysis was to be performed using corrected data for the stratification 
variables.  For  this  purpose,  a  separate  negative  binomial  regression  model  was  fitted  based  on  an 
updated data set for the PP patient set. For the multiple imputation sensitivity analysis described above 
corrected stratification data was used.  
Analysis excluding patient data from Site 7002 
The primary efficacy analysis was planned to be re-run as a sensitivity analysis by excluding all patient 
data from site 7002. Separate model fitting was carried out in the PP and the FAS sets. 
Results 
•  Participant flow 
A total of 531 patients were screened for enrollment into the study. Of these, 266 (50.1%) patients were 
considered screening failures, primarily due to failure to meet inclusion or exclusion criteria (242 [45.6%] 
patients). A total of 265 patients were randomized. One patient in the PB006 group withdrew consent 
prior  to  receiving  study  drug.  Thus,  264  patients  overall  were  treated  with  study  drug  (131  and  133 
patients in the PB006 and Tysabri groups, respectively).

Figure 6: Participant flow chart over Antilope Study 
A total of 247 (93.6%) patients completed the 24-week Primary Treatment Period: 122 (93.1%) in the 
PB006 group and 125 (94.0%) in the Tysabri group. Study drug was prematurely discontinued in the 
24-week Primary Treatment Period in 17 (6.4%) patients overall, with 9 (6.9%) patients in the PB006 
group  and  8  (6.0%)  in  the  Tysabri  group.  Six  (4.6%)  patients  in  the  PB006  group  prematurely 
discontinued study drug due to an AE, compared with 3 (2.3%) patients in the Tysabri group. One patient 
in  the  Tysabri  group  experienced  an  AE  leading  to  study  drug  withdrawal  at  the  Week  24  visit,  but 
completed the 24-week Primary Treatment Period. The patient is therefore not included in the 3 patients 
who discontinued due to an AE. In the AE summary prior to Week 24, this patient was included in the 4 
patients  who  discontinued  due  to  an  AE  because  the  event  occurred  during  the  24-week  Primary 
Treatment Period. 
Premature  discontinuation  of  study  drug  due  to  withdrawal  of  consent  during  the  24-week  Primary 
Treatment  Period  was  reported  for  6  (2.3%)  patients  (2  [1.5%]  patients  in  the  PB006  group  and  4

[3.0%] patients in the Tysabri group). Two (0.8%) patients discontinued the study due to other reasons 
(1 [0.8%] patient in each treatment group). 
At Week 24, all 125 patients in the Tysabri group who had completed the 24-week primary treatment 
period were re-randomized. Of those in the Tysabri group who were re-randomized, 95 patients remained 
on Tysabri and 30 patients were switched to PB006. Thus, the total number treated with PB006 at any 
time during the study was 161 patients.

•  Recruitment 
Study initiation date was 30 OCT 2019 (First Patient First Visit). 
Study completion date was 10 MAR 2021 (Last Patient Last Visit). 
The date of the last patient completing the PML Follow-up Visit (24 weeks after last dosing) was on 23 
AUG 2021. 
•  Conduct of the study 
The Clinical Study Report (CSR) for this study was issued on 10-DEC-2021 and later on two CSR addenda 
were issued (dated 07 FEB 2022 and 12 MAY 2022). Later, the identification of incorrect stratification at 
baseline led to preparation of a new version of the CSR (Amendment 1; Version 2.0) issued on 30-JUL-
2022, which is considered the final CSR for this MAA.   
The most important amendments to the initial CSR were the following: 
Amendment 1 (04 SEP 2019) introduced the following changes: two additional sampling times (4 weeks 
and 28 weeks) were added for anti-natalizumab antibody testing. 
Amendment 2 (05 FEB 2020) introduced the following changes: 
•  The study design and other relevant section were updated to include switching a group of 
patients  from  Tysabri  to  PB006  at  Week  24  to  evaluate  and  compare  the  immunogenic 
profiles  of  those  on  Tysabri  only  with  those  who  switched  –  including  re-randomization  at 
Week 24 
•  The numbers of study sites and countries was updated. 
•  Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Addition of requirements for MRIs performed at Baseline, at 
an Early Discontinuation Visit, and for unscheduled visits if PML is suspected. 
•  Primary Endpoint: Data analysis details were added. 
Amendment 3 (15 JUL 2020) introduced the following changes: 
•  Sub-Section 4.1 Overall Study Design: Removal of text reflecting that secondary endpoints 
are  evaluated  only  once  at  the  end  of  the  study,  due  to  the  shift  of  the  primary  analysis 
timepoint. 
•  Sub-Section  9.7  Primary  and  Final  Analysis  was  revised  to  reflect  a  shift  in  the  primary 
analysis timepoint. 
•  Sub-Section 10.4.2 Database Management and Quality Control: Removal of statement that 
database was to be locked for the primary and then for the final analysis, together with all 
other endpoints (at Visit 13, Week 48). 
Changes in conduct or analysis of the study due to COVID-19 are discussed in a separate section.  
Changes Following Study Unblinding/Database Lock and Post-hoc Analyses: 
The PB006-03-01 database interim lock occurred on 30 APR 2021. Errors were discovered in the study 
source data after the database lock, and are described below. 
•  Minor protocol deviations about incorrect stratification factor use during randomization were 
not registered in the clinical trial management system (CTMS) for 8 patients due to oversight. 
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 80/149 
 
 
 
The missing minor protocol deviations were recorded, Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) 
was re-run, and an updated protocol deviation listing was provided after the final database 
lock on 21 OCT 2021. 
•  After interim database lock, it was discovered that a protocol deviation for one patient was 
incorrectly recorded in CTMS. The minor protocol deviation was declassified, SDTM was re-
run, and an updated protocol deviation listing was provided after the final database lock on 
21 OCT 2021. 
•  Sponsor review of TFLs identified an inconsistency in the recording of the action taken with 
the study drug for AEs that caused patients to end treatment (9 patients). The database was 
unlocked and the appropriate fields were corrected. 
• 
It was discovered after database lock that some of the reasons for end of treatment phase 
were not consistent with the AEs that were recorded as causing treatment to be stopped for 
3 patients. The database was unlocked and the primary reason for withdrawal was corrected. 
For errors 1 and 2 above, no database unlock was required and there was no impact on the statistical 
analysis of the interim lock. Corrected and missing protocol deviations were included in the final database 
lock on 21 OCT 2021. 
For errors 3 and 4 above, there was no relevant impact on the statistical analyses. The database was 
unlocked  to  make  corrections.  Summary  table  for  discontinuation  reasons  were  updated  for  the  final 
database lock on 21 OCT 2021. 
A  second  database  unlock  occurred  on  11  JUL  2022  to  register  additional  minor  protocol  deviations 
related to incorrect stratification factors (see below).  
Summary of Changes Between Clinical Study Report Version 1 and Version 2 
After  finalization  of  the  initial  CSR  (Version  1.0,  dated  10  DEC  2021),  2  CSR  addenda  were  prepared 
(dated 07 FEB 2022 and 12 MAY 2022). On 07 JUN 2022, the identification of incorrect stratification at 
baseline  affecting  62  patients  resulted  in  the  performance  of  an  additional  sensitivity  analysis  of  the 
primary  analysis  using  correct  strata.  The  Sponsor  and  Contract  Research  Organisation  (CRO) 
determined  that  a  CSR  amendment  should  be  prepared  to  present  the  results  from  the  additional 
sensitivity analysis, as well as all information from the CSR addenda 1 and 2. Additional changes resulting 
from  Quality  Control  and  Sponsor  reviews  prior  to  finalization  are  included  in  this  CSR  Amendment  1 
(Version 2.0). 
A history of the main changes from CSR Version 1.0 (10 DEC 2021) to this CSR Amendment 1 (Version 
2.0) is presented below.  
CSR Addendum 1 (07 FEB 2022): 
Results  from  the  initial  analysis  of  immunogenicity  included  in  the  CSR  Version  1.0  were  limited  to 
timepoints considered most relevant for immunogenicity assessment (baseline [Week 0], Week 8, Week 
24,  Week  32,  and  the  End-of-Study/Week  48  or  Early  Discontinuation  Visit).  The  CSR  addendum  1 
presented the analysis of the immunogenicity results for all timepoints, including Week 4, Week 16, and 
Week 28, as well as any changes resulting from the analysis of the data from the additional timepoints.  
CSR Addendum 2 (11 MAY 2022): 
A data integrity issue at a clinical site (7002) was discovered after finalization of the initial CSR. In order 
to assess the impact of this issue on the validity of the primary endpoint results, a sensitivity analysis of 
the primary analysis was conducted, excluding patients from site 7002. Additionally, on request by the 
Rapporteurs, the analyses for EDSS endpoints was re-run excluding all patients from site 7002.

CSR 2.0 (30 JUL 2022) 
This CSR Version 2.0 integrates all changes from the CSR addenda 1 and 2 presented above, as well as 
additional changes described below. 
1. 
After  the  initial  database  lock  on  30  APR  2021,  it  was  discovered  that  for  26  patients, 
stratification  data  was  incorrectly  entered  into  the  eCRF  at  randomization.  This  was  corrected  post-
randomization. While the primary analysis of the primary endpoint was based on the stratification data 
used  for  randomization,  an  additional  sensitivity  analysis  was  performed  based  on  the  corrected 
stratification factors for the 26 patients, in order to assess the impact of the erroneous stratification, as 
described in the SAP. The corresponding results were reported in CSR Version 1.0. 
After finalization of CSR Version 1.0 (on 10 DEC 2021), 36 further cases of incorrect stratification (total 
of  62  patients)  were  discovered.  Thus,  the  sensitivity  analysis  was  re-  run  based  on  the  corrected 
stratification factors for the 62 patients. The eCRFs were not corrected for all patients because eCRF data 
had  been  locked  and  sites  were  closed  before  the  discrepancy  was  first  identified  on  07  JUN  2022. 
Therefore, eCRF data are not consistent with NeuroRX and/or Q2 Solutions data for 38 patients (eCRFs 
were corrected for 24 patients). The CSR Version 2.0 includes the results from the sensitivity analysis of 
all 62 patients with corrected stratification factors.  
2. 
At the request of the applicant, a statement was added to clarify the definition of “negative” and 
“positive” for anti-JCV antibodies according to the final result provided on the Q2 Solutions laboratory 
report.  
3. 
At  the  request  of  the  applicant,  text  was  revised  to  describe  the  number  of  patients  with 
confirmed positive ADAs at baseline rather than patients who were negative for ADAs at baseline. The 
change is due to the number of false positive screening assay results (which are then reported as ADA 
negative  upon  confirmatory  assay),  leading  to  a  lower  than  expected  number  of  patients  who  are 
negative for ADAs at baseline.  
After database lock (on 30 APR 2021), it was determined that for 26 out of 265 randomized patients 
(approximately 10% of the patient population), at least 1 of the 3 stratification factors (absence/presence 
of  GdE  lesions,  presence  of  T2  lesions,  JCV  status)  was  entered  incorrectly  into  the  eCRF  by 
investigational sites at Randomization. A root cause analysis and impact assessment was performed and 
revealed that the immediate risk for imbalanced strata was considered low. Moreover, since the issue 
was only identified in its totality at the end of the study after database lock, no corrective and preventive 
action  could  be  implemented  within  the  study  itself,  other  than  verifying  the  correctness  of  the  final 
status.  Since  the  study  was  blinded  and  the  randomization  was  performed  according  to  the  entered 
strata,  there  was  no  impact  on  the  data  integrity  of  the  study.  The  pre-specified  primary  analysis 
according to the SAP with the IWRS strata was following the intention to treat principle. 
On  07  JUN  2022,  after  finalization  of  the  CSR  Version  1.0,  it  was  discovered  that  the  incorrect 
stratification was not limited to the 26 cases identified in the original MTF (19 MAY 2021). A total of 62 
cases (at 25 sites across all participating countries) were affected. A discrepancy was identified in the 
percentage  of  patients  who  were  negative  for  JCV  at  baseline  (67.0%  of  patients  versus  59.8%  of 
patients).  The  outcome  of  additional  investigations  by  the  Sponsor  and  the    CRO  study  statistician 
revealed  that  at  least  1  stratification  factor  was  provided  incorrectly  during  randomization  for  the  62 
affected patients. The errors were distributed across 3 stratification factors: absence/presence of GDE 
lesions (20 errors), presence of T2 lesions (16 errors), and JCV status (38 errors), with 7 cases where 2 
stratification factors were entered incorrectly and 3 cases where all 3 factors were incorrectly provided. 
With approximately 23% of the patient population affected by the stratification errors and a potential 
risk of imbalanced strata across treatments, a thorough root-cause analysis and impact assessment was 
performed.

As corrective measures, minor protocol deviations were registered for all cases, and further training in 
randomization procedures was performed. The eCRFs were not corrected for all patients because eCRF 
data had been locked for more than a year when the issue was identified on 07 JUN 2022. Therefore, 
eCRF  data  are  not  consistent  with  NeuroRX  and/or  Q2  Solutions  data  for  38  patients  (eCRFs  were 
corrected for 24 patients). Also, an additional sensitivity analysis of the primary analysis using correct 
strata, as per Q2 Solutions and NeuroRX data, was performed. 
Since  the  study  was  double-blinded  and  the  randomization  was  performed  according  to  the  entered 
strata,  there  was  no  impact  on  the  data  integrity  of  the  study.  The  pre-specified  primary  analysis 
according to the SAP with the IWRS strata was following the ITT principle. The root cause analysis and 
impact assessment revealed that even with 23% of patients mis-stratified, the imbalance of strata was 
low and there was no significant impact on the primary analysis. The sensitivity analysis of the primary 
analysis using the corrected strata confirmed the primary analysis.  
Major protocol deviations were reported for 72 patients overall, with 36 (27.5%) patients in the PB006 
group and 36 (27.1%) patients in the Tysabri group. The majority of deviations were: study procedure 
or assessment (18 [13.7%] patients in the PB006 group and 15 [11.3%] patients in the Tysabri group), 
patient visit completion or timing (10 [7.6%] patients in the PB006 group and 7 [5.3%] patients in the 
Tysabri  group),  and  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  (5  [3.8%]  patients  in  the  PB006  group  and  8  [6.0%] 
patients in the Tysabri group). One (4.0%) major protocol deviation of SAE reporting in the PB006 group 
was reported in Poland and 1 (2.1%) major protocol deviation of randomization procedure in the Tysabri 
group was reported in Ukraine. 
Major protocol deviations related to COVID-19 were reported for 8 (6.1%) patients in the PB006 group 
and 5 (3.8%) patients in the Tysabri group. The majority of deviations in all countries were related to 
patient visit completion or timing (7 [5.3%] patients in the PB006 group and 5 [3.8%] patients in the 
Tysabri  group).  One  (0.8%)  patient  in  Ukraine  had  a  major  protocol  deviation  of  study  procedure  or 
assessment. 
•  Baseline data 
The  demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  were  similar  between  treatment  groups  for  the  FAS 
Population. The FAS Population was comprised of 162 (61.4%) female patients and 102 (38.6%) male 
patients, similarly distributed between treatment groups. Most (143 [88.3%]) female patients were of 
childbearing potential. The mean (SD) age of patients was 36.8 (9.05) years in the PB006 group and 
36.6 (9.73) years in the Tysabri group. Race was White (100.0% for both groups), and mean (SD) BMI 
was 24.1 (4.88) kg/m2 in the PB006 group and 24.2 (4.54) kg/m2 in the Tysabri group. At baseline, 
about half (140 [53.0%]) of patients had no GdE lesions; the remaining 124 (47.0%) patients had >0 
GdE lesions. The majority of patients had >15 T2 lesions (255  [96.6%] patients) and a negative JCV 
status (158 [59.8%] patients) (for details on corrected stratification factors, please see below).

Table 31: Frequency of stratification factor (FAS) 
For the COVID-19-confirmed patients (n=22) in the SAF Population, all parameters were similar to the 
FAS, SAF, PP, and SSW Populations. 
Similar  demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  were  reported  for  the  PP  Population  and  the  SSW 
Population. Demographic and baseline characteristics for the SAF Population were identical to the FAS 
Population. 
Medical History 
Similar  proportions  of  patients  in  both  treatment  groups  had  any  medical  history  other  than  MS  (93 
[71.0%] patients in the PB006 group and 94 [70.7%] patients in the Tysabri group). The medical history 
reported for at least 5% of patients in either treatment group were myopia, retinal vascular disorder, 
depression,  hypertension,  osteochondrosis,  and  astigmatism,  reported  by  18  (13.7%)  14  (10.7%),  9 
(6.9%),  7  (5.3%),  7  (5.3%),  and  4  (3.1%)  patients,  respectively,  in    the  PB006  group,  and  in  17 
(12.8%), 11 (8.3%), 5 (3.8%), 6 (4.5%), 6 (4.5%), and 7 (5.3%) patients, respectively, in the Tysabri 
group. Distribution of all other conditions was low and generally similar across treatment groups. 
Similar results were reported for the PP Population and the SSW Population. 
Similar proportions of patients in each treatment group had any current conditions (131 [100%] patients 
in the PB006 group and 133 [100%] patients in the Tysabri group). Current medical conditions (≥5% of 
patients  in  either  treatment  group)  that  occurred  in  similar  proportions  of  patients  in  both  treatment 
groups  included  MS,  myopia,  retinal  vascular  disorder,  depression,  and  osteochondrosis  (occurring  in 
131 [100%], 17 [13.0%], 14 [10.7%], 8 [6.1%],  and 7 [5.3%]  patients, respectively, in the PB006 
group, and 133 [100%], 17 [12.8%], 11 [8.3%], 5 [3.8%], and 6 [4.5%] patients, respectively, in the 
Tysabri group). Distribution of all other conditions was low and generally similar across the treatment 
groups. 
Similar current medical conditions were reported for the PP Population, and the SSW Population.  
Multiple Sclerosis Disease History 
The mean (SD) time since diagnosis for patients in the PB006 group (5.34 [4.655] years) was similar to 
patients in the Tysabri group (5.32 [4.800] years). The mean (SD) time since most recent relapse for 
patients in the PB006 group (5.08 [2.860] months) was slightly shorter than for patients in the Tysabri 
group (5.88 [3.038] months). 
The number of relapses in the 1 year prior to Screening was similar between treatment groups. Most 
patients  had  1  relapse  (86  [65.6%]  and  91  [68.4%]  patients  in  the  PB006  and  Tysabri  groups, 
respectively)  or  2  relapses  (37  [28.2%]  and  38  [28.6%]  patients  in  the  PB006  and  Tysabri  groups, 
respectively)  in  the  year  prior  to  Screening.  The  mean  (SD)  number  of  relapses  in  the  year  prior  to 
Screening (1.4 [0.68] for the PB006 group and 1.4 [0.57] for the Tysabri  group) and the mean (SD) 
baseline EDSS (3.4 [1.07] for the PB006 group and 3.2 [1.21] for the Tysabri group) were similar for 
both groups.

Multiple Sclerosis-Related Treatment History 
Similar  numbers  of  patients  in  both  treatment  groups  previously  received  any  medication  for  MS  (46 
[35.1%] patients in the PB006 group and 44 [33.1%] patients in the Tysabri group). The most frequently 
administered  prior  medications  were  interferon  beta-1a  (17  [13.0%]  and  10  [7.5%]  patients  in  the 
PB006 and Tysabri groups, respectively), interferon beta-1b (11 [8.4%] and 12 [9.0%] patients in the 
PB006 and Tysabri groups, respectively), dimethyl fumarate (13 [9.9%] and 9 [6.8%] patients in the 
PB006 and Tysabri groups, respectively), glatiramer acetate (10 [7.6%] and 9 [6.8%] patients in the 
PB006 and Tysabri groups, respectively), and laquinimod (3 [2.3%] and 6 [4.5%] patients in the PB006 
and Tysabri groups, respectively). All other MS medications were received by ≤1.5% of patients in either 
treatment group.

•  Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  cumulative  number  of  new  active  lesions  over  24  weeks.  The 
primary analysis was based on the PP Population, while the FAS Population was analyzed as sensitivity 
analysis. Results are presented for the PP Population in Table 32. 
The difference in new active lesions between Tysabri and PB006 was derived using a negative binomial 
model  with  log  link.  The  point  estimate  was  back-transformed  to  the  original  scale  for  similarity 
assessment. The point estimate (standard error [SE]) for the exponentiated difference between Tysabri 
and PB006 was 0.17 (0.397). The null hypothesis was rejected, as the 90% and 95% CI for the difference 
Tysabri-PB006 were within the specified margins (-2.1; 2.1). Thus, the primary endpoint was met.

Sensitivity Analyses of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
Analysis Based on the Full Analysis Set 
The sensitivity analysis of the primary analysis based on the FAS Population is presented in Table 33. As 
for the primary analysis, the difference in new active lesions between Tysabri and PB006 was derived 
using a negative binomial model with log link. The point estimate was back-transformed to the original 
scale for similarity assessment. The point estimate (SE) for the exponentiated difference between Tysabri 
and  PB006  was  0.23  (0.430).  The  null  hypothesis  was  rejected,  as  the  90%  and  95%  CIs  for  the 
difference Tysabri-PB006 were within the specified margins (-2.1; 2.1). Thus, the primary endpoint was 
confirmed. 
The  stratification  factor  absence/presence  of  GdE  lesions  was  found  to  have  an  influence  on  the 
cumulative number of new active lesions (with the p-value being <0.0001) and in contrast, treatment, 
presence of T2 lesions, and JCV status did not have an influence on the number of new active lesions 
(with corresponding p-values being >0.05).

Corrected Stratification Variables 
For a subset of patients (n=26), stratification data used for randomization was incorrectly entered at the 
study  sites  and  was  corrected  post-randomization.  These  cases  were  reported  as  minor  protocol 
deviations. While the primary analysis of the primary endpoint was based on the stratification data used 
for randomization, an additional sensitivity analysis was performed based on the corrected stratification 
factors in order to assess the impact of the erroneous stratification, as described in the SAP. This initial 
sensitivity analysis (n=26) was reported in CSR V1.0 (10 DEC 2021). 
On  07  JUN  2022,  after  finalization  of  the  CSR  Version  1.0,  it  was  discovered  that  the  incorrect 
stratification was not limited to the 26 cases identified in the original CSR V1.0. A total of 62 cases (at 
25  sites  across  all  participating  countries)  were  affected.  The  errors  were  distributed  across  3 
stratification factors: absence/presence of GdE lesions (20 errors), presence of T2 lesions (16 errors), 
and JCV status (38 errors). The eCRFs were not corrected for all patients because eCRF data had been 
locked for more than a year when the issue was identified on 07 JUN 2022. Therefore, eCRF data are 
not  consistent  with  NeuroRX  and/or  Q2  Solutions  data  for  38  patients  (eCRFs  were  corrected  for  24 
patients).  For  all  newly  identified  cases,  minor  protocol  deviations  were  registered.  As  a  corrective 
measure,  additional  sensitivity  analysis  of  the  primary  analysis  using  corrected  strata,  as  per  Q2 
Solutions and NeuroRX data, was performed. 
The sensitivity analysis of the primary analysis using corrected stratification variables for all 62 patients 
is presented in Table 34 for the PP Population. The point estimate (SE) for the exponentiated difference 
between Tysabri and PB006 was 0.06 (0.083). The null hypothesis was rejected, as the 90% and 95% 
CIs for the difference Tysabri-PB006 were within the specified margins (-2.1; 2.1). Thus, the primary 
endpoint was confirmed to be met using corrected stratification variables. 
The  stratification  factor  absence/presence  of  GdE  lesions  was  found  to  have  an  influence  on  the 
cumulative  number  of  new  active  lesions  (p-value  <0.0001).  In  contrast,  treatment,  presence  of  T2 
lesions, and JCV status did not have an influence on the number of new active lesions (with corresponding 
p-values being >0.05).

Multiple Imputation 
Sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint using multiple imputation is presented for the FAS 
Population in Table 35. All available data, including early discontinuation data, was used. The difference 
in new active lesions between Tysabri and PB006 was derived using a negative binomial model with log 
link. The point estimate was back-transformed to the original scale for similarity assessment. The point

estimate (SE) for the exponentiated difference between Tysabri and PB006 was -0.22 (0.300). The null 
hypothesis  was  rejected,  as  the  90%  and  95%  CIs  for  the  difference  Tysabri-PB006  were  within  the 
specified  margins  (-2.1;  2.1).  Thus,  the  sensitivity  analysis  showed  that  the  results  obtained  in  the 
primary analysis are robust. 
The  stratification  factor  of  absence/presence  of  GdE  lesions  was  found  to  have  an  influence  on  the 
cumulative  number  of  new  active  lesions  (p-value  <0.0001).  In  contrast,  treatment,  presence  of  T2 
lesions, and JCV status were found to not have an influence on the number of new active lesions (with 
corresponding p-values being >0.05).  
A sensitivity analysis of the primary analysis using multiple imputation for the pre-COVID PP Population 
was not performed, as there was no missing data to impute for the population.

Data Integrity Impact Assessment on the Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary efficacy analysis was re-run as a sensitivity analysis by excluding all patient data from site 
7002. In the following, the results of the primary efficacy analyses are compared with the corresponding 
results of the impact assessment sensitivity analyses. 
A  comparison  of  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  (Table  32)  and  the  corresponding  impact  assessment 
sensitivity analysis are shown in Table 36. The impact assessment results were similar to the original 
primary  analysis  results.  With  site  7002  patient  data  excluded,  the  CIs  were  larger  due  to  the  lower 
sample size, but still well within the pre-specified margins (-2.1; 2.1).

Summary of the Impact Assessment Analyses 
An  internal  quality  assessment  at  site  7002  revealed  serious  deviations  from  the  GCP  source  data 
handling requirements. However, there were no indications of fraud or a deliberate falsification of data. 
Study patients were genuine, and the trial execution was supported by available source data. Original 
source data were on file for several essential data points, e.g., MRIs, lab data reports. 
The  exclusion  of  data  for  all  17  patients  from  site  7002  did  not  change  the  outcome  of  the  primary 
endpoint analysis. The predefined equivalence criteria were met, and similarity of clinical efficacy was 
demonstrated. In total, 7 quality audits and 8 quality assessment visits were conducted at 8 investigator 
sites across countries. No other data integrity observations were identified at other participating study 
sites. As such, this data integrity issue was considered to be limited to site 7002.

outcome remain unchanged. 
Secondary Efficacy Analysis 
Cumulative Number of New Active Lesions Over 48 Weeks 
The mean cumulative number of new active lesions was slightly lower in the PB006 group than in the 
Tysabri group at all timepoints up to Week 48. The mean (SD) cumulative number up to Week 48 was 
1.5 (3.72) in the PB006 group, compared to 2.3 (5.68) in the Tysabri group. The results from the PP 
analysis were similar, with mean cumulative numbers being identical to the FAS for all timepoints. 
The average number of new active lesions per MRI scan was lower in the PB006 group than in the Tysabri 
group at all timepoints up to Week 48. The average number up to Week 48 was 0.31 in the PB006 group 
compared to 0.48 in the Tysabri group. The results from the PP analysis were similar.  
Compared  to  Week  8,  a  greater  percentage  of  patients  in  the  PB006  and  Tysabri  groups  had  no  new 
active lesions at Week 48, with similar percentages in both treatment groups (116 [98.3%] patients in 
the PB006 group and 88 [94.6%] patients in the Tysabri group). The percentage of patients with 1 to 3 
new active lesions similarly decreased in both treatment groups by Week 48 (2 [1.7%] patients in the 
PB006 group and 2 [2.2%] patients in the Tysabri group). No patients in the PB006 group had 4 or more 
new active lesions. In the Tysabri group, 4 to 6 new active lesions, 10 to 12 new active lesions, and >12 
new active lesions each occurred in 1 (1.1%) patient; no patients had 7 to 9 new active lesions. The 
results from the PP analysis were similar.  
Cumulative Number of New GdE T1-weighted Lesions Over 24 and 48 Weeks 
The mean cumulative number of new GdE T1-weighted lesions was slightly lower in the PB006 group 
than  in  the  Tysabri  group  at  all  timepoints  up  to  Week  48.  The  mean  (SD)  cumulative  number  up  to 
Week 24 was 0.3 (1.01)  in the PB006 group compared to  0.4 (1.25) in the  Tysabri  group, and up to 
Week 48 was 0.3 (1.02) in the PB006 group compared to 0.4 (1.39) in the Tysabri group. The results 
from the PP analysis were similar.  
The average number of new GdE T1-weighted lesions per MRI scan was lower in the PB006 group than 
in the Tysabri group at all timepoints up to Week 48. The average number up to Week 48 was 0.06 in 
the PB006 group compared to 0.09 in the Tysabri group. The results from the PP analysis were similar.  
Number of Patients Without New GdE T1-weighted Lesions Over 24 and 48 Weeks 
The percentage of patients without new GdE T1-weighted lesions was similar in the PB006 and Tysabri 
groups  at  24  weeks  (109  [83.2%]  and  105  [78.9%]  patients  in  the  PB006  and  Tysabri  groups, 
respectively) and at 48 weeks (105 [80.2%]) and (80 [77.7%] patients in the PB006 and Tysabri groups, 
respectively). The percentage of patients with at least 1 new GdE T1-weighted lesion was similar in both 
treatment groups over 24 weeks (17 [13.0%] and 22 [16.5%] patients in the PB006 and Tysabri groups, 
respectively) and over 48 weeks (17 [13.0%] and 16 [15.5%] patients in the PB006 and Tysabri groups, 
respectively). The results from the PP analysis were similar. 
Cumulative Number of New/Enlarging T2-weighted Lesions Over 24 and 48 Weeks 
The  mean  cumulative  number  of  new/enlarging  T2-weighted  lesions  was  slightly  lower  in  the  PB006 
group than in the Tysabri group at all timepoints up to Week 48. The mean (SD) cumulative number up 
to Week 24 was 1.5 (3.79) in the PB006 group compared to 2.0 (4.12) in the Tysabri group, and up to 
Week 48 was 1.6 (3.90) in the PB006 group compared to 2.4 (5.79) in the Tysabri group. The results 
from the PP analysis were similar, with mean cumulative numbers being nearly identical to the FAS for 
all timepoints.

Number of Patients Without New/Enlarging T2-weighted Lesions Over 24 and 48 Weeks 
The  percentage  of  patients  without  new/enlarging  T2-weighted  lesions  was  similar  in  the  PB006  and 
Tysabri  groups  at  24  weeks  (75  [57.3%]  and  72  [54.1%]  patients  in  the  PB006  and  Tysabri  groups, 
respectively). At 48 weeks, a slightly greater percentage of patients in the PB006 group were without 
new/enlarging T2-weighted lesions (71 [54.2%] patients) compared with the Tysabri group (52 [50.5%] 
patients).  The  percentage  of  patients  with  at  least  1  new/enlarging  T2-weighted  lesion  was  similar  in 
both treatment groups over 24 weeks (51 [38.9%] patients in the PB006 group and 55 [41.4%] patients 
in  the  Tysabri  group)  and  over  48  weeks  (51  [38.9%]  patients  in  the  PB006  group  and  44  [42.7%] 
patients in the Tysabri group). 
The results from the PP analysis were similar over 24 and 48 weeks.  
Number of Persistent Lesions After 24 and 48 Weeks 
The mean cumulative number of persistent lesions was similar in the PB006 and Tysabri groups at all 
timepoints up to Week 48. The mean (SD) number of persistent lesions up to Week 24 was 0.5 (2.46) 
and 0.4 (2.92) in the PB006 and Tysabri groups, respectively, and up to Week 48 was 0.5 (2.55) and 
0.6 (3.35) in the PB006 and Tysabri groups, respectively. 
For the PP Population, a slightly higher mean cumulative number of persistent lesions was reported in 
the PB006 group than in the Tysabri group at all timepoints up to Week 48.  The mean (SD) number of 
persistent  lesions  up  to  Week  24  was  0.5  (2.60)  and  0.2  (0.78)  in  the  PB006  and  Tysabri  groups, 
respectively,  and  up  to  Week  48  was  0.6  (2.69)  and  0.2  (0.87)  in  the  PB006  and  Tysabri  groups, 
respectively. 
Annualized Relapse Rate After 24 and 48 Weeks 
Over 24 weeks, a similar percentage of patients in the PB006 group and Tysabri group had 1 relapse (12 
[9.2%] and 9 [6.8%] patients in the PB006 and Tysabri groups, respectively), with a similar mean (SD) 
follow-up  time  for  both  groups  (0.445  [0.0772]  and  0.447  [0.0717]  years  in  the  PB006  and  Tysabri 
groups,  respectively).  No  patients  in  either  group  had  2  or  more  relapses  at  24  weeks. The  ARR  was 
similar over 24 weeks for the PB006 group (0.206) compared with the Tysabri group (0.152). 
Over 48 weeks, a similar percentage of patients in the PB006 group and Tysabri group had 1 relapse (18

Note: For timepoints after Week 24, patients who switch from Tysabri to PB006 are excluded from this table. 
The  data  integrity  impact  evaluation  for  site  7002  showed  that  EDSS  subscores  were  subject  to 
backdating in the source data for some patients. Therefore, a conservative approach was chosen and 
the EDSS data were re-analyzed excluding the data from site 7002. The results excluding the 17 patients 
from site 7002 are shown below.

Pharmacokinetic Results 
Natalizumab Ctrough was similar in the PB006 and Tysabri groups at all post-baseline timepoints. Mean 
(SD) natalizumab Ctrough was 26804.75 ng/mL (12949.541) and 25010.49 ng/mL (12557.895) at Week 
8  in  the  PB006  and  Tysabri  groups,  respectively,  and  gradually  increased  in  both  groups  at  each

COVID-19 Impact  
Plan 
Changes in conduct or analysis of the study due to Covid-19 could not be considered at start of the study 
since  the  virus  was  not  known  by  that  time.  In  the  documentation  of  statistical  methods  (Appendix 
6.1.9), a pre-COVID PP Population was described, defined as all PP patients, including those who were 
excluded from PP only due to major deviations related to COVID-19.  
In order to assess the impact of COVID-19 on safety and efficacy of the study the following was done: 
• Study discontinuations and protocol deviations due to COVID-19 were summarized 
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 94/149 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• Demography data for confirmed COVID-19 patients were summarized 
• Protocol deviations due to COVID-19 were summarized by country 
•  A  sensitivity  analysis  was  considered  to  be  performed  on  the  pre-COVID  PP  population.  Multiple 
imputation should be performed for this population. Sensitivity analysis should be done for the primary 
endpoint using imputed data for this population. 
Conduct & Outcome 
At the time COVID-19 was identified in 2019 and declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization 
on 11 March 2020, the PB006-03-01 study was still enrolling and treating patients, with the last patient 
randomized on 4 May 2020.  
The frequency of reviews for data quality assurance was increased after the declaration of the pandemic 
in March 2022 to be able to identify and respond to the potential problems.  
Major protocol deviations related to COVID-19 for the FAS were reported for 8 (6.1%) patients in the 
PB006 group and 5 (3.8%) patients in the Tysabri group. The majority of deviations in all countries were 
related to patient visit completion or timing.  
COVID-19  was  one  of  the  most  commonly  reported  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (in  total  24 
events  due  to  COVID-19).  One  patient  discontinued  due  to  a  treatment-emergent  adverse  event  of 
COVID-19. 
For COVID-19-confirmed patients (n=22) in the SAF Population, all parameters were similar to the FAS, 
SAF, PP, and SSW Populations. A sensitivity analysis of the primary analysis using multiple imputation 
for  the  pre-COVID  PP  Population  was  not  performed,  as  there  was  no  missing  data  to  impute  for  the 
population.  
•  Summary of main efficacy results 
The  following  tables  summarise  the  efficacy  results  from  the  main  studies  supporting  the  present 
application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as 
well as the biosimilarity assessment (see later sections). 
Table 43: Summary of efficacy for trial PB006-03-01 
Title: Antelope: Efficacy and Safety of the Biosimilar Natalizumab PB006 in Comparison to Tysabri in Patients with 
Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) 
Study identifier 
PB006-03-01 
EudraCT Number: 2018-004751-20 
Design 
This was a Phase 3 multicenter, double-blind, active-controlled, randomized, parallel-group 
study  to  assess  the  similarity  in  efficacy,  safety,  and  immunogenicity  of  biosimilar 
natalizumab PB006 compared to European Union-approved Tysabri in patients with RRMS. 
Eligible patients were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive intravenous infusions every 4 weeks of either PB006 or Tysabri at a dose of 300 
mg starting at Visit 1 (Week 0) through Visit 12 (Week 44), for a total of 12 infusions.  
The primary efficacy endpoint, cumulative number of new active lesions over 24 weeks, 
was evaluated after 24 weeks. 
Based on requirements by the FDA a subset of 30 patients was switched after 24 weeks of 
treatment with Tysabri to treatment with PB006 for the remaining treatment period, to rule 
out any major safety risks in terms of hypersensitivity, immunogenicity or other reactions, 
potentially associated with such a switch.

Results and Analysis 
Analysis description 
Primary Analysis 
Analysis  population  and 
time point description 
Per-Protocol  Population:  Only patients  participating  in this  study who completed  the 
24-week treatment period without major protocol deviations that may have influenced the 
analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint  and  for  whom  sufficient  post-baseline  MRI  data  were 
available  (including baseline,  Week 24 and at least 1 out  of the 3 other  scheduled  MRI 
visits) were to be included in the Per-Protocol (PP) Population. The final decision on the 
PP Population was to be made in the blinded data review meeting before database lock for 
the final analysis of the primary endpoint.  
Full Analysis Set Population: The Full Analysis Set (FAS) Population was to include all 
patients who were randomized and received at least 1 (complete or partial) infusion of the 
study drug. Patients were to be analyzed according to the treatment group to which they 
were randomized.

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The applicant conducted a pivotal efficacy and safety study, PB006-03-01, to compare PB006 to the EU 
reference product Tysabri.  
This  was  a  randomized,  double-blind,  active-controlled,  parallel-group  study  to  compare  the  efficacy, 
safety and immunogenicity of PB006 versus EU-Tysabri, and to demonstrate similarity between PB006 
and EU-Tysabri in patients with RRMS. 
In general, the study design followed the Scientific Advice received from CHMP in 2017. 
The inclusion criteria define patients with RRMS. The criteria in this study are less stringent than in the 
SmPC  of  the  originator  (e.g.,  only  one  third  of  patients  had  2  or  more  relapses  in  the  year  prior  to 
screening).  However,  the  eligibility  criteria  do  resemble  those  of  the  pivotal  phase  3  studies  of  the 
originator and thus, the selected study population is regarded sufficiently sensitive for the comparative 
efficacy assessment. The exclusion criteria are found in line with the contraindications, special warnings, 
and precautions for use of the reference product, Tysabri EU, and with the scientific advice received.  
The dose of 300 mg, dosing frequency (once every 4 weeks), route and method of administration are in 
line with the SmPC of the reference product and are thus, appropriate. The number of doses (12) over 
a study period of 44 weeks is also considered adequate. 
The primary endpoint, cumulative number of new active lesions over 24 weeks, and secondary endpoints, 
i.e.,  cumulative  number  of  new  active  lesions  over  48  weeks,  cumulative  number  of  new  GdE  T1-
weighted lesions over 24 and 48 weeks, number of patients without new GdE T1-weighted lesions over 
24  and  48  weeks,  cumulative  number  of  new/enlarging  T2-weighted  lesions  over  24  and  48  weeks, 
number  of  patients  without  new/enlarging  T2-weighted  lesions  over  24  and  48  weeks,  number  of 
persistent lesions after 24 and 48 weeks, ARR after 24 and 48 weeks and change from baseline in EDSS 
after 24 and 48 weeks are considered adequate to assess the clinical similarity between the biosimilar 
candidate  and  the  reference  product  because  they  examine  the  effect  on  brain  lesion  activity  and 
measure the delay of the disability, respectively. Moreover, the efficacy endpoints are in line with the 
“Guideline  on  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal  products  for  the  treatment  of  Multiple  Sclerosis” 
(EMA/CHMP/771815/2011, Rev. 2), the efficacy endpoints studied in the clinical trials which supported 
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 103/149 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the MA of the reference product, Tysabri EU and the “Guideline on similar biological medicinal products 
containing interferon beta” (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/652000/2010). 
The  primary  endpoint  was  also  endorsed  during  the  Scientific  Advice  in  2017.  For  this  endpoint,  the 
applicant defined an equivalence margin of 2.1 lesions based on the lower bound of the 95% CI of the 
pooled  effect  size  estimated  in  a  controlled  trial  of  natalizumab  for  RMS  published  in  2003.  This  is 
problematic in two ways.  
First, the methodological considerations for the derivation of the margin are based on a single study, 
because  only  one  appropriate  reference  for  the  derivation  of  the  equivalence  margin  in  the  agreed 
primary  endpoint  could  be  sourced.  The  relatively  small  sample  size  in  that  study  (approximately  70 
patients per treatment arm) and the fact that in the lack of further data no meta-analysis was possible, 
introduce uncertainty about the actual effect size of natalizumab over placebo in the selected endpoint. 
Thus, a more conservative planning of the equivalence margin would have been desirable. Secondly, the 
mean number of new active lesions over 6 months with natalizumab was only approximately 1 in the 
cited publication by Miller et al. In light of this low number in new lesions observed with the comparator, 
the  equivalence  margin  of  2.1  is  considered  rather  wide  for  the  efficacy  similarity  assessment  from  a 
therapeutic perspective, which was derived solely based on methodological considerations on the large 
effect  size  of  natalizumab  with  8.7  lesions  (95%  CI:  4.14  to  13.35)  in  the  publication  of  Miller  et  al. 
Further, the reference article is dated in 2003. During the last years, the therapeutic management of 
RMS  has  evolved  towards  a  more  intensive  management  of  inflammatory  activity  so  it  is  highly 
questionable that 2.1 lesions within 24 weeks could be considered as no relevant from a therapeutic RMS 
management perspective. However, the actual difference that was observed for the primary endpoint in 
study PB006-03-01 was close to zero and the 95% CI was narrow and accounted for a difference of less 
than one lesion (point estimate: 0.17 lesions; 95% CI: -0.613; 0.944). Thus, the primary endpoint would 
have been met even with a tighter equivalence margin. 
It is noted that no biomarker of PD was included in the study. This is striking, since a lot of emphasis 
has been put on the evaluation of PD markers in the phase 1 study in healthy volunteers. The inclusion 
of  PD  markers  in  the  phase  3  study  would  have  allowed  to  draw  conclusions  on  the  robustness  and 
validity of the respective markers by comparison of the response in healthy subjects and patients.  
From the methodological view, several issues concerning the randomisation procedure were identified. 
One  of  those  issues  pertains  to  the  applied  method  of  dynamic  allocation  per  se  and  its  potential  for 
type-1-error inflation. The applicant provided details on the methodology, but uncertainty still persists 
as  regards  a  potential  inflation  due  to  the  specific  situation  resulting  from  complex  randomisation 
methodology  and  erroneous  stratification.  However,  from  an  assessment  perspective  it  is  considered 
very unlikely that the impact is of a magnitude that altered general study conclusions, and is therefore 
not considered finally relevant for the conclusion on biosimilarity. Another area for further assessment 
is about potential implications arising from misinterpretation of stratification data which lead to erroneous 
stratification  during  randomisation.  However,  additional  sensitivity  analyses  corroborated  that  the 
influence of stratification errors was negligible and did not change study conclusions. 
The definition of the analysis sets is considered adequate. In general, the statistical methods chosen for 
descriptive  as  well  as  inferential  analyses  are  considered  suitable.  The  use  of  negative  binomial 
regression analysis for the comparative primary efficacy evaluation of lesion count data is endorsed.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 265 patients were randomized. Of those, 264 patients were treated with study drug (131 and 
133 patients in the PB006 and Tysabri groups, respectively). 93.6% of the enrolled patients completed 
the  primary  study  period  of  24  weeks  and  90.5%  completed  the  entire  study.  Discontinuation  due  to 
adverse events accounted for 4.5% overall and was twice as abundant in the PB006 group compared to 
Assessment report

the Tysabri group. Baseline characteristics as well as medical history (including MS disease history) were 
well balanced between groups.  
Misclassification of the three stratification factors was discovered on two occasions; first, after database 
lock but still during the study (26 cases) and later after finalization of the CSR for a total of 62 cases. 
The errors were distributed across all 3 stratification factors (absence/presence of GdE lesions, presence 
of T2 lesions, and JCV status). A root cause analysis and impact assessment were conducted. According 
to the applicant, this analysis revealed that even with 23% of patients mis-stratified, the imbalance of 
strata was low and there was no significant impact on the primary analysis. In some strata, however, 
the relationship between the two groups flipped and the impact on the analysis is not entirely clear. This 
issue  is  discussed  further  below  for  the  primary  efficacy  analysis.  Given  the  late  discovery  of  the 
misclassification of the three stratification factors, the applicant was asked to discuss any impact on the 
study results. It was affirmed that there was no significant impact of the misclassification of the three 
stratification  factors  on  the  study  results.  The  treatment  arms  ended  up  being  well-balanced  for  the 
corrected strata and the sensitivity analysis performed using the corrected strata confirms the primary 
analysis.  Most  importantly,  it  was  affirmed  that  no  inclusion  of  subjects  with  JCV  index  >1.5  had 
occurred.  
The analysis of the primary endpoint was the cumulative number of new active lesions over 24 weeks. 
The primary analysis was based on the PP Population and demonstrated similarity between the test and 
reference product based on the pre-specified equivalence margin. 
Subsequently, sensitivity analyses were conducted to account for the errors in stratification and the GCP 
related findings.  
The  first  sensitivity  analysis  was  conducted  using  corrected  stratification  variables  for  all  62  patients, 
who had been misclassified. From this model, a 95%-CI is obtained showing a width being 20% of the 
width of the CI resulting from the original model using faulty stratification data. The potential prognostic 
impact of the stratification variables was not substantially altered by using the corrected stratification 
factors, and the stratification factor absence/presence of GdE lesions was found to have an influence on 
the cumulative number of new active lesion in both models. The change in the point estimate and CI 
was  shown  to  be  caused  by  few  influential  outlying  values.  When  re-conducting  the  primary  efficacy 
analysis as a sensitivity analysis by excluding all patient data from site 7002, where the routine quality 
assessment  revealed  questionable  data  integrity,  similar  results  to  the  original  primary  analysis  were 
obtained.  The  CI  was  larger  due  to  the  lower  sample  size,  but  still  within  the  pre-specified  margins. 
Finally, after correction for stratification and excluding site 7002, the primary outcome also demonstrated 
a small 95% CI well within the pre-specified margin. The primary outcome measure was distinctly lower 
than 1 and positive in all analyses, meaning that the number of new lesions was slightly lower for PB006 
than the reference product.  
While sensitivity analyses were conducted on the primary efficacy endpoint to account for the impact of 
stratification correction and exclusion of one study centre, no such data were presented for the secondary 
endpoints.  Upon  request,  the  applicant  affirmed  that  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  as  well  as  the 
secondary efficacy endpoints based on MRI readings were not affected by the GCP issue encountered at 
site 7002. EDSS was pointed out as the only efficacy or safety parameter that may have been affected 
by  the  inconsistencies  encountered  at  site  7002.  The  applicant  has  re-run  the  analyses  for  EDSS 
endpoints excluding all 17 patients from site 7002 demonstrating very similar results as in the overall 
analysis.  
Generally, the result of the primary analysis is supported by the results of the secondary analyses. 
Most  of  the  secondary  efficacy  parameters  displayed  similar  results  between  treatments.  In  some 
parameters,  numerically  lower  numbers  were  observed  for  PB006.  This  was  the  case  for  the  mean 
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 105/149 
 
 
 
cumulative number of new active lesions, the number of new active lesions per MRI scan, and new active 
lesions at Week 48, and the mean cumulative number of new/enlarging T2-weighted lesions.  
The  number  of  disease  relapse,  on  the  other  hand,  was  larger  in  the  PB006  group  compared  to  the 
reference product. Over 24 weeks there were 12 relapses in the PB006 group compared to 9 cases in 
the Tysabri group, corresponding to an ARR of 0.206 and 0.152, respectively. Over 48 weeks the number 
of relapses was 20 and 12 for PB006 and Tysabri, respectively, and the ARR was 0.174 as compared to 
0.133. 
Overall, less new active lesions and less T2-weighted lesions were observed after treatment with PB006 
as compared to Tysabri. However, this trend was not reflected in the relapse rate, which was higher in 
the PB006 group as compared to Tysabri, although it is acknowledged that the overall number of relapses 
over  48  weeks  was  low  in  both  treatment  arms  in  study  PB006-03-01,  with  18  (13.7%)  of  patients 
having one relapse and 1 patient (0.8%) having two relapses in the PB006 and 12 (11.7%) of patients 
in the EU-Tysabri group having one relapse. Interpretation is slightly hampered by the fact the 131 and 
133 patients began treatment in the PB006 and Tysabri arm, respectively, whereas 131 and 103 patients 
continued treatment through week 48 due to the fact that 30 patients were switched from Tysabri to 
PB006  after  24  weeks.  For  better  comparison,  the  applicant  provided  ARR  data  obtained  with  the 
originator. According to the Tysabri product information, ARR was 0.281 versus 0.805 for Tysabri and 
placebo, respectively, after one year. This shows that the relapse rate observed in study PB006-03-01 
(0.174 and 0.133 for PB006 and Tysabri, respectively) is in line with the published data on Tysabri.  
Further,  the  proportion  of  patients  who  received  methylprednisolone  as  rescue  therapy  was  similar 
between treatment groups. 
EDSS scores were similar between treatment groups. The mean change from baseline was minimal and 
similar in both treatment groups at 24 weeks and at 48 weeks. 
In order to assess the impact of COVID-19 on safety and efficacy of the study the following was done: 
• Study discontinuations and protocol deviations due to COVID-19 were summarized 
• Demography data for confirmed COVID-19 patients were summarized 
• Protocol deviations due to COVID-19 were summarized by country 
•  A  sensitivity  analysis  was  considered  to  be  performed  on  the  pre-COVID  PP  population.  Multiple 
imputation should be performed for this population. Sensitivity analysis should be done for the primary 
endpoint using imputed data for this population. 
The  applicant  explained  that  this  sensitivity  analysis  was  not  conducted  because  the  pre-COVID  PP 
population and the PP population were identical.  
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
From the presented data on efficacy, biosimilarity between the PB006 and EU-Tysabri can be concluded. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
The  assessment  of  safety  in  the  PB006  clinical  program  was  focused  on  the  comparison  of  PB006  to 
Tysabri. Safety data with PB006 were collected in studies PB006-01-02, PB006-01-03 and PB006-03-01. 
These safety data are presented by study, i.e., no integrated analysis was performed, due to the different 
study designs, populations and doses administered. 
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 106/149 
 
 
 
The principal safety data for PB006 and comparative safety data with Tysabri is derived from the pivotal, 
Phase  1,  single-dose  study  in  450  healthy  subjects  (PB006-01-03)  and  the  pivotal  Phase  3,  multiple-
dose  study  in  264  RRMS  patients  (PB006-03-01)  treated  for  up  to  48  weeks.  In  both  studies,  safety 
analyses were based on the SAF, defined as all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug. 
Subjects were analysed as treated. In the Phase 3 study PB006-03-01, additional safety analyses were 
performed for the SSW population, defined as patients who received at least one infusion of study drug 
after the time point of re-randomization. 
Similar procedures for assessing safety were followed in the Phase 1 study PB006-01-03 and the Phase 
3 study PB006-03-01. In addition to evaluation of AEs, SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation, adverse 
events  of  special  interest  (AESIs)  were  defined  for  study  PB006-03-01.  Both  studies  included  an 
assessment of ECG, vital signs and physical examination. 
In study PB006-01-03, AEs were reported from start of intervention until the end of study Visit (Day 85). 
In  study  PB006-03-01,  AEs  were  reported  from  screening  until  Week  48/  end  of  study  or  Early 
Discontinuation visit. 
In  both  studies,  safety  monitoring  included  an  assessment  of  neurological  symptoms  which  could  be 
suggestive of PML, and both studies included a PML follow-up visit 6 months after the last dose of study 
drug to monitor for AEs suggestive of PML. 
For  study  PB006-03-01,  PML,  JCV  granule  cell  neuronopathy,  opportunistic  infections,  liver  injury, 
hypersensitivity,  encephalitis,  meningitis,  and  acute  retinal  necrosis  were  defined  as  AESIs,  based  on 
the known safety profile of Tysabri. 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
Overall, PB006 was administered to 159 healthy subjects as single dose (for 149 of these subjects at 3 
mg/kg, and for 10 of these subjects at 300 mg), and to 161 patients with RRMS as multiple doses of 300 
mg in 4-weekly intervals.  
Tysabri  (US-Tysabri  or  EU-Tysabri)  was  administered  to  337  healthy  subjects  as  single  dose  (1  to  6 
mg/kg), and EU-Tysabri was administered to 133 patients with RRMS as multiple doses of 300 mg in 4-
weekly intervals. 
Study PB006-01-02 
This  was  a  single-dose  study  with  PB006  in  healthy  male  and  female  subjects.  A  total  of  68  subjects 
were  screened,  and  10  of  these  were  enrolled  and  received  a  single  IV  dose  of  300  mg  PB006 
(administered over 60 minutes). All 10 subjects completed the study as per protocol, and comprised the 
SAF population.  
Study PB006-01-03 
This was a single dose study with PB006, EU-Tysabri and US-Tysabri in healthy male and female subjects. 
A total of 453 subjects were randomized (150, 152 and 151 in the PB006, EU-Tysabri and US-Tysabri 
groups, respectively). Three of the randomized subjects were not dosed with study drug. One subject 
did not receive study drug due to an error in the pharmacy (only diluent was infused); one subject was 
not dosed due to a vasovagal reaction prior to dosing; one subject was not dosed due to problems with 
venous access. Thus, 149, 151 and 150 subjects received a single IV dose of 3 mg/kg PB006, EU-Tysabri 
and US-Tysabri, respectively, and comprised the SAF population.  
On  16  Mar  2020,  study  enrolment  was  temporarily  held  due  to  COVID-19.  At  this  time  16  subjects 
completed  the  study  (3  received  3  mg/kg  PB006,  5  received  3  mg/kg  EU-Tysabri,  and  8  received  3 
Assessment report

mg/kg US-Tysabri), and were included in the Pre-stop Safety Set. The other 434 subjects completed the 
study after the study halt or were enrolled after restart of the study and were included in the Post-stop 
Safety Set. 
A total of 438 subjects completed the study, 145, 148 and 145 in the PB006, EU-Tysabri and US-Tysabri 
groups, respectively. No subject discontinued the study due to an AE). 
All subjects in the SAF population received the full dose of study drug. In 4 subjects, the infusion was 
temporarily interrupted (e.g., due to problems with the flow of infusion; not due to AEs. 
For PB006, the lowest dose administered was 156 mg natalizumab and the highest dose administered 
was 274 mg natalizumab. For EU-Tysabri, the lowest dose administered was 150.3 mg natalizumab and 
the highest dose administered was 276.1 mg natalizumab. For US- Tysabri, the lowest dose administered 
was 151.3 mg natalizumab and the highest dose administered was 275.6 mg natalizumab. 
Study PB006-03-01 
This was a multiple-dose study in RRMS patients. Study drug (PB006 or EU-Tysabri) was administered 
as 300 mg IV infusion, in 4-week intervals, for a total of 12 infusions.  
A  total  of  265  patients  were  randomized,  132  patients  to  treatment  with  PB006  and  133  patients  to 
treatment  with  EU-Tysabri.  One  patient  randomized  to  the  PB006  group  withdrew  consent  prior  to 
receiving study drug. Thus, 264 patients overall were treated with study drug, i.e., 131 and 133 patients 
in the PB006 and EU-Tysabri groups, respectively. After 24 weeks of treatment, 30 patients from the 
EU-Tysabri group were switched to treatment with PB006 for the remaining treatment period. Thus, the 
total number of patients treated with PB006 at any time during the study was 161. 
Patient disposition by primary randomization was similar for the 2 treatment groups, as summarized for 
the full analysis set (FAS; identical to the SAF population with regard to patient numbers) in

A total of 247 patients (93.6%) completed the 24-week primary treatment period, 122 (93.1%) in the 
PB006  group and 125 (94.0%) in the EU-Tysabri  group. The percentage of patients who prematurely 
discontinued study drug in the 24-week period was similar in the PB006 and EU-Tysabri groups (6.9% 
versus 6.0%). Six patients (4.6%) in the PB006 group prematurely discontinued due to an AE, compared 
with 3 patients (2.3%) in the EU-Tysabri group.  
At Week 24, all 125 patients in the EU-Tysabri group who had completed the primary treatment period 
were  re-randomized.  Of  these,  30  patients  were  switched  to  treatment  with  PB006  for  the  remaining 
treatment period, and 95 patients remained on EU-Tysabri and were thus treated with EU-Tysabri for 
the entire study. 
Of the 30 patients in the switch group, 29 patients (96.7%) completed the study, and 1 patient (3.3%) 
discontinued due to AE. Of the 95 patients who remained in the EU-Tysabri group, 93 patients (97.9%) 
completed the study and 2 patients (2.1%) discontinued (both due to withdrawal of consent).  
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
Study PB006-01-02 
Treatment-emergent  adverse  events  were  reported  in  8  subjects  (80%),  and  study  drug  related 
treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) were reported in 6 subjects (60%). In all subjects, TEAEs were mild or

moderate,  and  no  severe  TEAEs  were  reported.  No  SAEs,  fatal  AEs  or  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation 
occurred in the study. 
Most  commonly  reported  TEAEs  were  in  the  system  organ  class  (SOCs)  general  disorders  and 
administration site conditions (80%) and nervous system disorders (50%). On the preferred term (PT) 
level, most common were headache (5 subjects, 50%), and catheter site pain, fatigue and injection site 
haematoma (2 subjects each, 20%). All other TEAEs were reported in 1 subject each. 
Of  the  6  subjects  (60%)  who  experienced  at  least  1  study  drug-related  TEAE,  the  most  commonly 
reported was headache (5 subjects, 50%). The remaining event was fatigue (1 subject, 10%). 
Study PB006-01-03 
In  this  single-dose,  healthy  subject  study,  AE  frequencies  were  similar  across  the  3  groups. 
Approximately  two-thirds  of  subjects  in  each  group  reported  any  TEAE,  while  in  34-37%  of  subjects 
across groups, study drug-related TEAEs occurred. No fatal TEAEs occurred. SAEs were reported for 2 
subjects (1.3%; 6 SAEs overall) treated with US-Tysabri, while no SAEs occurred in the other 2 groups. 
No subject reported TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation.

Sorted by descending frequency in the “total” column. 
Most  frequently  reported  were  TEAEs  in  the  SOCs  nervous  system  disorders  (30-33%  across  groups) 
and general disorders and administration site conditions (29-34% across groups). 
On the PT level, most frequently reported was headache (26-30% across groups), followed by AEs related 
to the injection/infusion, with PTs of injection site reaction (18-21% across groups), infusion site reaction 
(1-4%  across  groups),  vessel  puncture  site  reaction  (1-5%  across  groups),  and  catheter  site  related 
reaction (2-3% across groups).

While on the level of individual PTs the frequencies may have slightly differed between the PB006, the 
EU-Tysabri  and  US-Tysabri  groups,  the  overall  AE profile  was  considered  to  be  similar  between  the  3 
groups. 
COVID-19 analyses 
Eleven AEs of COVID-19 and 1 AE of asymptomatic COVID-19 were reported. All cases were mild with 
the outcome being recovered. No subjects were withdrawn due to COVID-19. None of the subjects had 
received a COVID-19 vaccination. 
The overall frequency of AEs was similar in the Pre-stop and the Post-stop  Safety Set (62.5% versus 
67.5% of subjects overall). Generally, the limited number of subjects in the Pre-stop Set (N=16) does 
not allow a meaningful comparison to the Post-stop Set. 
Adverse events related to study drug 
TEAEs related to study drug are presented by SOC and PT in table below. The percentage of subjects 
with related TEAEs was similar in all 3 treatment groups.

per treatment group.

While on the level of individual PTs the frequencies may have slightly differed between the PB006, the 
EU-Tysabri and US-Tysabri groups, the AE profile of study drug-related TEAEs was overall considered to 
be similar between the 3 groups. 
In the majority of subjects, TEAEs were mild. Mild TEAEs were reported in 65.6% of subjects, with similar 
frequencies across groups. Moderate TEAEs were reported in 6.0% of subjects, with similar frequencies 
across groups. Only 1 subject, treated with US-Tysabri, reported severe TEAEs, acute kidney injury and 
ureterolithiasis. Both were unlikely related to study drug, and the outcome was reported as recovered. 
Study PB006-03-01 
In  this  multiple-dose  study  in  RRMS  patients,  AE  frequencies  were  generally  balanced  across  the  3 
groups.

**A TEAE was considered to be leading to withdrawal from study only if the patient did not proceed to PML follow-up because of this event. 
Overall, the percentages of patients with TEAEs and with TEAEs related to study drug were similar across 
groups. Approximately two-thirds of patients in each group reported any TEAE, while in approximately 
25% of patients in each group, study drug-related TEAEs occurred. Few patients experienced TEAEs of 
Grade 3, AESIs, SAEs, or AEs leading to study drug discontinuation or withdrawal. The frequencies of 
TEAEs of Grade 3 and of TEAEs leading to discontinuations were numerically higher in the PB006 group 
than in the other groups. However, these differences were not considered to be clinically meaningful.

TEAEs are presented for the overall treatment period of 48 weeks in 2 formats in the clinical study report, 
1) by preceding treatment and 2) by treatment sequence.  
In the tables by preceding treatment, the PB006 group includes AE data from the 131 patients who were 
initially randomized to PB006 plus data from the 30 patients who switched from the EU-Tysabri group to 
PB006 after 24 weeks (for the remaining 24-week treatment period); thus, the number of patients for 
this group is 161. In addition, AE data are presented for the 133 patients who were randomized to and 
treated with EU-Tysabri. In this presentation AEs occurring in patients after switching from EU-Tysabri 
to PB006 were counted for both treatment arms. In order to account for the varying exposure in the 2 
groups, event rates per 100 patient years (PY) are included.  
In  the  tables  by  treatment  sequence,  AE  data  are  presented  for  the  131  patients  who  received  only 
PB006 for the full treatment period, the 30 patients who switched from EU-Tysabri to PB006, and the 
103 patients who received only EU-Tysabri for the full treatment period (i.e., not including the patients 
who switched to PB006 after 24 weeks).  
In  order  to  account  for  the  varying  exposure  in  the  3  treatment  groups,  event  rates  per  100  PY  are 
included. 
In the present report, the focus lies on the evaluation of events by treatment sequence.

N=number of patients in group, PT=preferred term, PY=patient year, SAF=safety population, SOC=system organ class, TEAE=treatment-emergent adverse event. 
Note: *Patient years calculated as the sum of (last day of follow-up – first day of exposure + 1)/365.25 for all patients in group. Adverse events were summarized 
according to the randomized study drug sequence. 
With regard to AE data by treatment sequence, the percentage of patients with TEAEs was similar in the 
PB006, switch and the EU-Tysabri groups (64.9, 73.3 and 68.9%), with event rates per 100 PY of 192.34, 
219.62 and 194.65, respectively. 
Most frequently reported in all groups were TEAEs in the SOCs infections and infestations (29.8, 50.0 
and 33.0% in PB006, switch and EU-Tysabri groups, respectively) and nervous system disorders (25.2, 
26.7 and 23.3% in PB006, switch and EU-Tysabri groups, respectively). On the PT level, most frequently 
reported was headache (19.1, 13.3 and 18.4% in PB006, switch and EU-Tysabri groups, respectively), 
followed by nasopharyngitis (8.4, 16.7 and 7.8% in PB006, switch and EU-Tysabri groups, respectively) 
and COVID-19 (8.4, 13.3 and 5.8% in PB006, switch and EU-Tysabri groups, respectively). While on the 
level  of  individual  PTs  the  frequencies  slightly  differed  between  the  PB006  and  EU-Tysabri  groups, 
sometimes favoring Tysabri and sometimes favoring PB006, the AE profile was overall considered to be 
similar between the 2 groups. In the switch group, the AE frequencies tended to be higher compared to 
the other 2 groups. However, when interpreting the data, the limited group size needs to be considered.  
A summary of TEAEs after the switch of a subset of patients from EU-Tysabri to PB006 (i.e., time period 
from Week 24 to 48) is provided for the SSW population. The frequencies of TEAEs were similar in the 
PB006  continuing,  switch,  and  EU-Tysabri  continuing  groups  (45.1,  50.0  and  44.2%,  respectively). 
Comparing the AE data for patients switching from EU-Tysabri to PB006 versus patients continuing on 
EU-Tysabri no clinically meaningful differences were observed.

Note: *Patient years calculated as the sum of (last day of follow-up – first day of exposure + 1)/365.25 for all patients in group. Adverse events were summarized 
according to the randomized study drug sequence. 
With regard to AE data by treatment sequence, the percentage of patients with study drug-related TEAEs 
was similar in the PB006, switch and the EU-Tysabri group (23.7, 26.7 and 21.4%), with event rates per 
100 PY of 46.13, 54.90 and 56.40, respectively. 
Most  frequently  reported  in  both  groups  were  study  drug-related  TEAEs  in  the  SOCs  infections  and 
infestations (4.6, 10.0 and 8.7% in PB006, switch and EU-Tysabri groups, respectively), nervous system 
disorders  (7.6,  3.3  and  1.9%  in  PB006,  switch  and  EU-Tysabri  groups,  respectively)  and  general 
disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (4.6,  13.3  and  2.9%  in  PB006,  switch  and  EU-Tysabri 
groups,  respectively).  On  the  PT  level,  most  frequently  reported  was  headache  (5.3,  0  and  1.9%  in 
PB006, switch and EU-Tysabri groups, respectively), followed by dizziness (1.5, 3.3 and 1.0% in PB006, 
switch and EU-Tysabri groups, respectively). While on the level of individual PTs the frequencies slightly 
differed between groups, the AE profile was overall considered to be similar between the 3 groups.  
With regard to data after the switch (week 24 to 48), the frequencies of study drug-related TEAEs were 
similar in the PB006 continuing, switch group and EU-Tysabri continuing groups (4.9, 10.0 and 7.4%, 
respectively). The total number of events in the 3 groups was 6, 3 and 7, respectively. Comparing the 
AE profile for patients switching from EU-Tysabri to PB006 versus patients continuing on EU-Tysabri no 
clinically meaningful differences were observed.

Treatment-emergent adverse events of CTCAE Grade 3 occurred in few patients (4 patients treated with 
PB006, 1 patient treated with EU-Tysabri, and no patients in the switch group).  
With regard to events in PB006 group, the events alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased and a nasal 
septum deviation were both assessed as not related and recovered or recovering. Nasal septum deviation 
was  serious.  The  event  of  blood  triglycerides  increased  was  assessed  as  probably  related,  with  the 
outcome being recovered. The event of urticaria was assessed as probably related, with the outcome 
being recovered. Study drug was discontinued due to this AE. 
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Study PB006-01-03 
There were no fatal AEs in this study. SAEs were reported for 2 subjects and were unlikely related to 
study drug (based on investigator assessment) and were resolved within 1 or 2 days.  
Study PB006-03-01 
There were no fatal AEs in this study. SAEs were reported for 5 subjects. 
All  SAEs  except  for  an  event  of  hypotension  were  not  or  unlikely  related  to  study  drug,  based  on 
investigator assessment. Hypotension, experienced by one patient in the PB006 group, was assessed as 
possibly related to study drug, and the patient discontinued due to this SAE. A female (30-50 years of 
age)  patient  had  an  ongoing  medical  history  of  essential  hypertension.  She  received  a  total  of  12 
infusions  of  PB006.  During  the  Week 44  infusion,  the  patient  experienced  the  SAE  of  moderate 
hypotension. (blood pressure decreased to below 70/50  mmHg). After medication, the patient’s blood

investigator  could not rule out infusion-related reaction and considered this event to  be  an important 
medical  event.  The  study  drug  was  permanently  discontinued  the  same  day,  and  the  patient  was

Except  for  1  patient  in  the  PB006  group  (who  discontinued  due  to  COVID-19),  all  TEAEs  leading  to 
discontinuation  were  at  least  possibly  related  to  study  drug.  Most  common  TEAEs  leading  to 
discontinuation  were  pruritus  and  urticaria,  which  are  known  and  common  adverse  drug  reactions  of

Most commonly reported were events of herpes (with PTs oral herpes, herpes simplex, herpes zoster) 
and urticaria. The profile of AESIs was considered to be similar for PB006 and EU-Tysabri. 
Anti-JCV antibody status and PML risk evaluation 
Throughout clinical development of PB006, the STRATIFY JCV DxSelect assay was used by Polpharma 
Biologics for screening of study subjects and as risk minimisation measures during the biosimilar clinical 
studies. In parallel, a new anti-JCV IgG assay was developed (ImmunoWELL JCV IgG assay) for use in 
clinical practice. Analytical performance of the ImmunoWELL JCV IgG test was validated for its precision, 
selectivity (interference and cross-reactivity), a potential hook-effect, and robustness (including sample 
and  kit  stability).  Effects  of  plasma  or  serum  sample  matrix  were  also  evaluated.  Provided  results 
confirmed the suitability of the assay for its intended use and the test has CE marking for the qualitative 
detection of antibodies to JC Virus in human serum or plasma. 
Samples collected during the PB006 biosimilar clinical studies PB006-03-01 and PB006-01-03 were used 
for clinical validation of the ImmunoWELL JCV IgG assay against the STRATIFY JCV DxSelect assay by 
comparison  of  the  STRATIFY  JCV  DxSelect  test  results  with  ImmunoWELL  JCV  IgG  test  results  from 
matching samples (taken at the same time during the clinical studies). 
A detailed clinical validation report has been provided. Further information on the design and validation 
of the ImmunoWELL JCV IgG assay is included in the instructions for use provided with the test kits.  
Similar to the STRATIFY JCV DxSelect assay, upper and lower cut-offs were defined for the equivocal 
zone in a separate screening assay to balance sensitivity and specificity of the ImmunoWELL JCV IgG 
Test. This resulted in an equivocal zone ranging from 0.25 to 0.50 for the screening assay, similar to the 
cut-off values for the STRATIFY JCV DXSelect assay (0.20 to 0.40).  
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 122/149 
 
 
 
 
Consecutively, a total of 397 unique samples were included in the final clinical performance evaluation. 
There were 200 healthy subjects evaluated with both the STRATIFY JCV DxSelect and the ImmunoWELL 
JCV IgG Test. In addition, 197 (RR)MS patients were evaluated  with both the current standard assay 
and the ImmunoWELL JCV IgG Test.  
Samples from healthy subjects covered the entire range of index values of the STRATIFY JCV DXSelect 
test (0 to >4). However, due to the PML risk in MS patients, the index range for patient samples taken 
during clinical study PB006-03-01 only extended up to 1.5. This condition had previously been agreed 
with  national  scientific  advice  procedures.  Despite  the  restricted  index  range  for  patient  samples,  the 
previously defined cut-off (0.5) falls well within the range of samples.  
The correlation of index values from both assays is shown in the following figure, separately for healthy 
subjects (A) and MS patients (B). 
Figure 7: Correlation of index values from both assays for healthy volunteers (A) and R(R)MS patients 
Note: samples from healthy subjects (panel A) were obtained from study PB006-01-03, samples from patients with relapsing remitting 
multiple sclerosis (RRMS, panel B) from study PB006-03-01 
Further,  clinical  performance  of  the  ImmunoWELL  JCV  IgG  Test  was  compared  to  the  STRATIFY  JCV 
DxSelect  test  in  terms  of  assay  sensitivity,  specificity,  positive  predictive  value  (PPV)  and  negative 
predictive value (NPV). The results are summarised in the following table.  
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 123/149 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 55: Assay sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value 
(NPV) 
High concordance was found for assay sensitivity and NPV, whereas PPV had only 67% performance in 
MS patients. As the assay is supposed to reliably detect anti-JVC antibodies in patients, the values for 
sensitivity and NPV are the most critical ones, whereas a low PPV does not raise a concern for missing 
JVC  infections  in  patients.  However,  in  clinical  practice  the  above-described  cut-off  values  for 
determination of positive/negative results are of relatively minor importance. Rather, risk stratification 
is  currently  based  on  index  values  between  0.9  and  1.5  in  clinical  practice.  Therefore,  the  applicant 
presented  further  comparative  test  data  from  the  healthy  subject  population  across  the  whole  index 
range,  and  based  on  a  regression  analysis  it  was  implied  that  the  ImmunoWELL  JCV  IgG  test  might 
slightly underestimate the index estimated from the STRATIFY JCV DxSelect test (see also Discussion on 
clinical safety). 
Moreover, the applicant provided an analysis with the focus on values in and around the range of 0.9-
1.5 using additional data from the analysis of MS patient samples with higher JCV index values.  
Data  from  the  combined  MS  patient  data  set  was  used  for  correlation  analysis  and  a  high  degree  of 
correlation between the test results was observed at low (<0.9), intermediate (0.9 - 1.5) and high index 
values  (1.5  -  2.5).  Similar  to  previous  observations  from  healthy  subject  samples,  the  correlation 
decreases  at  very  high  index  values  above  approx.  2.5  (due  to  saturation  effects/non-linearity  of  the 
qualitative ELISA test). This difference is regarded clinically not meaningful as all patients with high index 
values  are  in  the  “high  PML  risk”  category,  without  further  sub-stratification  by  index  value.  For 
regression analysis, the range <2.5 was therefore selected, showing a high degree of correlation in terms 
of slope and intercept in the clinically relevant index range.

At the relevant threshold values of 0.9 and 1.5, the estimated ImmunoWELL JCV IgG test values for MS 
patients are 0.882 (90% confidence interval: 0.849 - 0.921) and 1.451 (90% confidence interval: 1.388 
- 1.517). The relative differences are 2.0% and 3.3.%, respectively. If a minor offset exists between the 
two assays, it is expected to be below 0.1 index values.

Sub-range  analyses  with  the  focus  on  values  in  and  around  the  range  of  0.9-1.5  were  performed  to 
determine sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV for the qualitative test results (positive/negative). The 
combined total data set from MS patient samples described above is shown as an example in the following 
figure  covering  the  entire  index  value  range  with  ‘true’  positives  (TP),  ‘false’  positives  (FP),  ‘true’ 
negatives (TN) and ‘false’ negatives (FN) highlighted by colour.

The  applicant  also  assessed  the  binary  agreement  between  the  STRATIFY  JCV  DxSelect  and  the 
ImmunoWELL JCV IgG results at the threshold values of 0.9 and 1.5. Sensitivity in this analysis describes 
the percent of ImmunoWELL JCV IgG test index values above the threshold within those where STRATIFY 
JCV  DxSelect  index  values  are  above  the  threshold,  whereas  specificity  describes  the  percent  of 
ImmunoWELL JCV IgG test index values below the threshold within those where STRATFIY index values 
are below the threshold. For the combined MS patient data set at threshold index values, the results are 
visualized in the following figure, using the same color coding for ‘true’ positives, ‘true’ negatives, ‘false’ 
positives and ‘false’ negatives as above.

PPV / NPV = positive / negative predictive values  
For  both,  the  combined  MS  patient  populations  and  the  healthy  subject  population,  high  sensitivities 
were  observed  at  the  threshold  values  of  0.9  (92.1%  and  94.3%)  and  1.5  (89.7%  and  91.3%), 
corresponding to the low numbers of false negatives. Also, the specificity values in this analysis indicate 
strong agreement with results of 91.9% and above. The revised threshold values of 0.8 and 1.4 generally 
lead to a minor improvement in sensitivity for the ImmunoWELL JCV IgG test (e.g. from 92.1% to 92.9% 
at  the  lower  threshold  and  from  89.7%  to  91.4%  at  the  upper  threshold  for  MS  patients)  and  a 
concomitant minor reduction in specificity (see Discussion on Clinical Safety). 
All  clinical  studies  included  for  safety  reasons  a  PML  follow-up  visit  6  months  after  (last)  dosing  with 
study drug, to assess new neurological symptoms which could be suggestive of PML. Of note, for the 
healthy subject studies this visit was not mandatory, and in the time period between the end of study 
visit and the PML follow-up visit the subjects were not considered as study subjects.  
Study PB006-01-02 
Screening for anti-JCV antibodies was only performed at screening, and subjects who were JCV-positive 
were not enrolled in the study. Of the 68 subjects who were screened, 39 were JCV-positive and therefore 
not eligible for inclusion in the study.  
No PML cases were reported in the study and no new neurological symptoms, which could be suggestive 
for PML were observed on the additional follow-up visit on Day 169 (±1 week) after administration of 
the study drug.  
Study PB006-01-03 
Subjects who were JCV-positive were not enrolled in the study. All subjects who were randomized were 
tested negative for anti-JCV antibodies at Screening 1. On Day 85, 19 subjects tested positive for anti-
JCV antibodies, 9 subjects after PB006, 4 subjects after EU-Tysabri, and 6 subjects after US-Tysabri.  
No PML cases were reported in the study and no new neurological symptoms that could be suggestive 
for PML were observed for the subjects who returned for the additional follow-up visit on Day 169. 
Study PB006-03-01 
While at baseline, no patients presented with a JCV index >1.5, the percentage of patients who were 
JCV-positive with index >1.5 increased during the treatment period in both groups. An index >1.5 was 
reported for 4.9 and 4.5% of patients in the PB006 and EU-Tysabri groups, respectively, at Week 24 and 
for 6.0 and 5.9% of patients in the PB006 and EU-Tysabri groups, respectively, at Week 48.   
No cases of PML occurred in this study. For 5 patients, PML was suspected based on MRI findings. PML 
was not confirmed in subsequent clinical evaluations in any of these patients. 
Additionally, investigators were to monitor all patients who had received at least one dose of study drug 
(including  prematurely  withdrawn  patients)  for  PML  for  approximately  6  months  after  discontinuing 
natalizumab.  Of  the  265  patients  randomized,  253  subjects  completed  the  PML  follow-up  visit.  No 
subjects had any signs suggestive of PML at the follow-up visit. 
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Natalizumab binds to the α4 subunit of the α4β1-integrin that is highly expressed on the surface of all 
leukocytes, with the exception of neutrophils.

Study PB006-01-03 
In study PB006-01-03, increases from baseline in mean numbers of circulating leukocytes, lymphocytes, 
eosinophils and monocytes were reported, which were similar in all 3 treatment groups. These increases 
are  consistent  with  expression  of  α4β1  on  these  white-cell  subgroups  and  are  a  known  PD  effect  of 
natalizumab [Polman et al. 2006]. 
Mean numbers of leukocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils and monocytes at Day 36 and Day 85 (end of 
study) are summarized in the following table.

For all these parameters the increases were transient, with values returning to or below baseline levels 
at Day 85. Changes from baseline in neutrophils were small. 
In  addition,  small  mean  decreases  from  baseline  were  observed  for  haematocrit,  erythrocytes, 
hemoglobin and platelets. 
The majority of subjects had at least 1 out-of-range clinical laboratory value. Most of these were minor 
and considered by the investigator to have no clinical implication. 
Out-of-range values were considered to be clinically significant by the investigator for 4 subjects. For 
these subjects laboratory TEAEs were reported: 
•  One subject (EU-Tysabri): ALT increased and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased, 
both unlikely related to study drug, outcome recovered. 
•  One subject (PB006): leukocytosis, unlikely related to study drug, outcome recovered. 
•  One subject (EU-Tysabri): leukocyturia, unlikely related to study drug, outcome recovered. 
•  One  subject  (US-Tysabri):  anaemia,  unlikely 
related 
to  study  drug,  outcome 
recovering/resolving. 
In addition, the laboratory AE haematuria was reported in 1 subject (11031) in the PB006 group. 
One subject had a positive pregnancy test on Day 85. On Day 109 the pregnancy was terminated by an 
induced abortion. 
Overall, results for laboratory parameters were similar for PB006, EU-Tysabri and US-Tysabri.

Increases in eosinophils, with a mean change of 0.15 and 0.17 x 109/L from baseline to end 
of study in PB006 and EU-Tysabri, respectively. 
Increases in leukocytes, with a mean change of 1.73 and 2.06 x 109/L from baseline to end 
of study in PB006 and EU-Tysabri, respectively. 
Increases in  lymphocytes, with a mean change of 1.57 and 1.76 x 109/L from baseline to 
end of study in PB006 and EU-Tysabri, respectively. 
Increases in monocytes, with a mean change of 0.11 and 0.12 x 109/L from baseline to end 
of study in PB006 and EU-Tysabri, respectively. 
•  Small decreases in hemoglobin, with a mean change of -5.3 and -1.5 g/L from baseline to 
end of study in PB006 and EU-Tysabri, respectively. Larger decreases were reported at other 
timepoints during the treatment period. 
Generally, the changes from baseline  were of a similar extent  in both treatment groups. Increases in 
leukocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils and monocytes and known PD effects of natalizumab; decreases 
in hemoglobin are known adverse reactions and described in the Tysabri SmPC. No clinically relevant 
changes from baseline were observed for the other parameters. 
At baseline, most patients in both treatment groups had normal hematology values for all parameters. 
The majority of the changes from baseline for most abnormal hematology parameters were small, not 
clinically  relevant,  and  similar  between  the  treatment  groups.  Notable  findings  were  observed  for 
hemoglobin, leukocytes and lymphocytes. 
Hemoglobin was reported as low at baseline for 8.4% and 10.5% of patients in the PB006 and EU-Tysabri 
groups, respectively. At all subsequent timepoints up to Week 40, a larger percentage of patients in both 
groups presented with low hemoglobin values. In both groups, the largest percentage of patients with 
low hemoglobin values was reported at Week 32 (with 19.5% in PB006 and 16.1% with EU-Tysabri).  
At  the  end  of  study,  15.0  and  8.0%  of  patients  in  the  PB006  and  EU-Tysabri  groups,  respectively, 
reported low hemoglobin. However, in absolute values decreases in hemoglobin were rather small, with 
a mean change of -5.3 and -1.5 g/L from baseline to end of study in PB006 and EU-approved Tysabri, 
respectively (values at baseline were 141.6 g/L in both groups). 
The percentage of patients with high leukocyte counts increased for both groups (14.4 and 14.8% in the 
PB006 and EU-approved Tysabri groups, respectively) at the end of study compared to baseline (3.8 and 
5.3% patients in the PB006 and EU-Tysabri groups, respectively). Similarly, the percentage of patients 
with high lymphocyte counts increased for both groups (25.5 and 23.3% in the PB006 and EU-Tysabri 
groups, respectively) at the end of study compared to baseline (1.5 and 0% in the PB006 and EU-Tysabri 
groups, respectively). The largest percentage was reported at Week 40, when 33.0 and 31.5% of patients 
in the PB006 and EU-Tysabri group, respectively, presented with high lymphocytes. 
Hematology values were categorized as within reference range (normal) or outside the reference range 
(low or high), and shifts in the categories between baseline were analyzed. Parameters showing a shift 
to  levels  outside  the  reference  range  (normal  to  low)  in  ≥10%  of  patients  in  both  treatment  groups 
included  erythrocytes,  hemoglobin,  and  neutrophils/leukocytes.  Parameters  showing  a  shift  to  levels 
outside  the  reference  range  (normal  to  high)  in  ≥10%  of  patients  in  both  treatment  groups  included 
leukocytes, lymphocytes, lymphocytes/leukocytes, and neutrophils. Parameters showing a shift to levels 
outside  the  reference  range  (normal  to  high)  in  ≥10%  of  patients  in  the  PB006  group  only  included

basophils/leukocytes and haematocrit. Parameters showing a shift to levels outside the reference range 
(normal to high) in ≥10% of patients in the EU-Tysabri group only included eosinophils/leukocytes. 
Hematology TEAEs 
AEs  of  anaemia  were  reported  for  4  patients  in  the  PB006  group,  and  iron  deficiency  anaemia  and 
normocytic  anaemia  were  reported  for  1  patient  each  in  the  EU-Tysabri  group.  Lymphocyte  count 
increased and white blood cell count increased were reported as AE in 1 patient each in the EU-Tysabri 
group.  In  addition,  neutropenia  was  reported  in  1  patient  in  the  EU-approved  Tysabri  group,  and 
lymphopenia was reported in 1 patient in the PB006 group. 
Serum chemistry results 
In general, mean serum chemistry values at baseline were similar for the PB006 and EU-Tysabri groups. 
The  mean  changes  from  baseline  were  generally  small,  not  clinically  relevant,  similar  between  the 
treatment groups, and did not indicate any clinically meaningful trend in serum chemistry values over 
the course of the study overall or within either treatment group. 
At  baseline,  most  patients  in  both  treatment  groups  had  normal  serum  chemistry  values  for  most 
parameters. The majority of the changes from baseline for abnormal serum chemistry parameters were 
small,  not  clinically  relevant,  and  similar  between  the  treatment  groups.  At  baseline,  both  treatment 
groups had patients with abnormal high cholesterol (40.5% in the PB006 group and 32.3% in the EU-
Tysabri group) and abnormal high low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (35.1% in the PB006 group 
and 28.6% in the EU-Tysabri group) but no notable changes in either treatment group occurred for those 
parameters by the end of study (31.6 and 34.4% for cholesterol in the PB006 and EU-Tysabri groups, 
respectively, and 29.1 and 28.0% for LDL cholesterol in the PB006 and EU-Tysabri groups, respectively). 
Chemistry values were categorized as within reference range (normal) or outside the reference range 
(low or high), and shifts in the categories between baseline were analyzed. Parameters showing a shift 
to  levels  outside  the  reference  range  (normal  to  high)  in  ≥10%  of  patients  in  both  treatment  groups 
included C-reactive protein, cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. Parameters showing a shift 
to  levels  outside  the  reference  range  (normal  to  high)  in  ≥10%  of  patients  in  the  PB006  group  only 
included bilirubin and direct bilirubin. A shift in phosphate to levels outside the reference range (normal 
to low) in ≥10% of patients was reported in both treatment groups and a shift in high density lipoprotein 
cholesterol to levels outside the reference range (normal to low) in ≥10% of patients was reported for 
the Tysabri group only. 
Serum chemistry TEAEs 
AEs of hyperbilirubinaemia were reported for 1 patient each in the PB006 and the switch groups, and 
bilirubin conjugated increased was reported for 1 patient in the PB006 group. With regard to liver enzyme 
elevations, ALT increased was reported for 2 patients in the PB006 group and for 1 patient in the EU-
Tysabri group; AST increased was reported for 1 patient in the EU-Tysabri group, and gamma-glutamyl 
transferase increased was reported for 1 patient each in the PB006 and the switch group. Hyperlipidaemia 
was reported for 1 patient in the switch group, blood triglycerides increased was reported for 1 patient 
for  the  PB006  group  and  hypertriglyceridemia  was  reported  for  1  patient  in  the  EU-Tysabri  group.  C-
reactive protein increased was reported for 2 patients in the PB006 group and 1 patient in the EU-Tysabri 
group.  
Overall, with regard to clinical laboratory, the results were similar for PB006 and EU-Tysabri. The safety 
profile of laboratory AEs was similar for PB006 and EU-Tysabri and in line with the published data for 
Tysabri.

2.6.8.5.  Immunological events 
Immunogenicity Assays 
In  the  development  of  the  reference  product  Tysabri,  persistent  antibodies  were  associated  with  a 
substantial decrease in the effectiveness of natalizumab and an increased incidence of hypersensitivity 
reactions.  Additional  infusion-related  reactions  associated  with  persistent  antibodies  included  rigors, 
nausea,  vomiting  and  flushing.  At  that  time,  antibodies  against  natalizumab  were  detected  in 
approximately  10%  of  patients  in  2-year  controlled  clinical  trials  in  MS  patients  and  persistent  anti-
natalizumab antibodies developed in approximately 6% of patients. 
The applicant has adopted an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) bridging assay to screen, 
confirm and quantify in terms of titer of quantify natalizumab specific antibodies in human serum matrix. 
The adopted three-tiered approach for determination of ADAs was well described and developed. It is 
considered state of the art and valid for its intended use.  
Further,  the  applicant  presented  a  qualitative  assay  for  the  detection  of  neutralising  ADA’s  in  human 
serum.  The  presented  assay  was  well  described  and  established.  It  was  setup  correctly  and  fully 
validated. Thus it is considered valid for its intended use.  
Study PB006-01-02 
The ADA test results of study PB006-01-02 indicated that a single IV infusion of 300 mg PB006 induced 
a treatment-emergent ADA response in 3 out of 10 subjects (30%) of subjects. While this was higher 
than the ADA incidence reported in the Tysabri studies that were conducted by the originator, this result 
is  consistent  with  a  higher  drug  tolerance  level  of  the  PB006  ADA  assay  compared  to  that  of  the 
originator’s assay. The detected ADA response was not associated with any treatment-related adverse 
events. 
Study PB006-01-03 
The  immunogenicity  of  PB006  (N=149  subjects)  was  evaluated  in  direct  comparison  to  EU-Tysabri 
(N=151) and US-Tysabri (N=150) following a single intravenous infusion of 3 mg PB006/kg to healthy 
volunteers. 
There  was  no  detectable  difference  in  ADA  or  NAb  response  dynamics  in  subjects  receiving  PB006 
compared to EU-Tysabri or US-Tysabri: 
•  The  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  ADA following  a  single  intravenous  infusion  of  3  mg 
natalizumab/kg to healthy volunteers was similar across all three treatment groups: 87% for 
PB006 compared to 87% for EU-Tysabri and 92% for US-Tysabri. 
•  NAb was detected in the majority of ADA positive subjects, again at a similar incidence across 
the three treatment groups: 84% for PB006 compared to 77% for EU-Tysabri and 87% for 
US-Tysabri in terms of the total number of treated subjects. 
•  ADA and NAb titer profiles were indistinguishable across treatment groups 
There was no treatment-related difference in the impact of ADA or NAb positive status on PK (AUC0-inf 
and  Cmax)  or  PD  (Blood  CD19+,  α4-integrin  receptor  saturation,  blood  CD34+,  soluble  VCAM-1  and 
soluble MAdCAM-1). 
By all parameters evaluated, the immunogenicity profile of PB006 was indistinguishable from that of EU-
Tysabri and US-Tysabri.

Treatment-emergent ADA 
Through Week 24, 79% of subjects in the PB006 treatment group were confirmed positive for treatment- 
emergent ADA compared to 74% for EU-Tysabri. For PB006, 23% of subjects were classified as transient 
ADA positive compared to 56% persistent ADA positive; for EU-Tysabri, 19% of subjects were classified 
as transient ADA positive compared to 55% persistent ADA positive. 
Geometric mean maximal (Week 0 to 24) ADA titer for total treatment-emergent ADA positive was 223.6 
for PB006 compared to 150.7 for EU-Tysabri. Median ADA titer in both treatment groups was 160. 
The  peak  frequency  of  ADA  positive  subjects  was  at  week  8  for  PB006  (65%  ADA  positive)  and  EU- 
Tysabri  (61%  ADA  positive),  declining  progressively  thereafter  to  11%  for  PB006  and  10%  for  EU- 
Tysabri  at  week  48.  Geometric  mean  ADA  titer  increased  from  the  24-  to  48-week  timepoints  in  the 
diminishing proportion of ADA positive subjects in both treatment groups. 
Overall  time-course  of  the  ADA  response  to  PB006  mirrored  that  of  the  ADA  response  to  EU-Tysabri 
throughout  the  48-week  treatment  period  in  terms  of  ADA  frequency,  but  with  a  modestly  higher 
geometric mean ADA titer for PB006. As discussed in ISI sections 3.2.5 and 3.2.6, there was no difference 
in either the drug trough concentrations or efficacy parameters; and results from the comparative single-
dose PK study (PB006-01-03) indicated a modestly lower geometric mean ADA titer for PB006 compared 
to EU-Tysabri or US-Tysabri. While it is unclear if the observed difference in geometric ADA titer observed 
in  the  PB006-03-01  study  represents  a  real  difference,  there  was  no  impact  on  drug  exposure  or  on 
efficacy. 
NAb 
A relatively high proportion (approx. 87%) of ADA positive subjects were also NAb positive, indicating 
suitable  sensitivity  /  drug  tolerance  of  the  NAb  assay.  NAb  titers  were  also  measured  to  optimize  a 
comparison  of  the  relative  magnitude  of  the  humoral  immune  response  to  PB006  compared  to  EU- 
Tysabri. 
At Week 24, in terms of the total number of treated subjects, 69% of subjects in the PB006 treatment 
group were positive for NAb compared to 66% for EU-Tysabri. Geometric mean maximal (Week 0 to 24) 
NAb titer was 39.2 for PB006 compared to 32.6 for EU-Tysabri. Median NAb titer for week 0 to 24 was 
23.0 for PB006 compared to 26.0 for EU-Tysabri.  
Persistent ADA and NAb combined 
In the confirmatory efficacy and safety study, PB006-03-01, there was a strong concordance between 
the  ADA  and  NAb  response  dynamics  in  the  PB006  treatment  group  compared  to  those  for  subjects 
treated  with  EU-Tysabri:  at  the  24-week  treatment  timepoint  corresponding  to  the  primary  efficacy 
endpoint, the incidence of persistent treatment-emergent ADA was 79% for PB006 compared with 74% 
for EU-Tysabri, allied to a NAb positive incidence of 69% for PB006 compared with 67% for EU- Tysabri 
in terms of the total number of treated subjects. 
Impact of ADA / NAb on systemic drug concentration 
PB006 vs. EU-Tysabri 
Because serum drug levels represent the most sensitive indicator of ADA formation at levels that could 
influence clinical responses, serum total natalizumab trough concentration was compared for the ADA 
positive  vs.  ADA  negative  subpopulations  in  each  treatment  group  at  Week  24  and  Week  48.  A 
corresponding analysis for the NAb positive vs. NAb negative subpopulations was also performed.  
At  week  24,  the  geometric  mean  total  serum  natalizumab  trough  concentration  was  similar  for  ADA 
positive subjects treated with PB006 (11375.8 ng/mL) or EU-Tysabri (10405.1 ng/mL). For NAb positive 
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 132/149 
 
 
 
subjects  at  Week  24,  the  geometric  mean  total  serum  natalizumab  trough  concentration  was  slightly 
higher  for  the  PB006  treatment  group  (8350.6  ng/mL)  compared  to  the  EU-  Tysabri  treatment  group 
(6957.4 ng/mL). 
Serum natalizumab trough concentration was clearly lower in ADA positive subjects compared to ADA 
negative subjects in the same treatment group: at week 24, the geometric mean total serum natalizumab 
concentration  for  ADA  positive  subjects  treated  with  PB006  was  31%  of  that  for  the  ADA  negative 
subjects;  for  EU-Tysabri,  the  geometric  mean  total  serum  natalizumab  trough  concentration  for  ADA 
positive subjects treated with PB006 was 30% of that for the ADA negative subjects. The high overlap 
of  the  95%  CIs  for  serum  total  natalizumab  trough  concentration  by  ADA/NAb  category  supports  the 
conclusion  that  there  was  no  difference  in  the  scale  of  impact  of  ADA  or  NAb  formation  on  serum 
natalizumab concentration following treatment with PB006 or EU-Tysabri for 24 weeks. 
At week 48, the lower number of ADA positive (n=13 for PB006; n=9 for EU-Tysabri) or NAb positive 
(n=8 for PB006; n=4 for EU-Tysabri) subjects hampers the comparison across treatment groups. The 
geometric mean total serum natalizumab concentration for the ADA positive and NAb positive subjects 
in all treatment groups were lower than those at week 24, most likely reflecting the higher ADA and NAb 
titers measured at week 48 compared to week 24. 
Impact of ADA / NAb on efficacy endpoints 
Overall, there was no treatment-related difference in the impact of ADA or NAb positive status on either 
the primary (week 24) or secondary (week 48) efficacy endpoints in study PB006-03-01. Although ADA 
titers increased during the 48-week treatment period, ADA and NAb frequency progressively declined, 
which could reduce the scale of any negative impact of increasing ADA / NAb titer on clinical efficacy at 
the treatment group level during continuing treatment. This may explain why the ADA / NAb positive 
subpopulations showed similar efficacy at week 48 compared to week 24 despite the higher ADA and 
NAb titers at week 48. 
Impact of ADA on clinical safety 
Because  infusion-related  reactions  associated  with  persistent  antibody-positivity  are  a  recognized  risk 
for  Tysabri,  line  listings  are  presented  to  describe  the  relationship  of  hypersensitivity  reactions  and 
symptoms  corresponding  to  the  SMQ  term  “anaphylaxis”  reported  in  study  PB006-03-01  to  ADA 
positive/negative status and coincident ADA titer. 
In  subjects  treated  with  PB006,  10  events  were  reported  from  9  subjects;  7  of  the  events  were 
considered  as  being  possibly  or  probably  related  to  drug  administration.  Five  of  the  7  events  were 
detected  in  subjects  with  a  coincident  classification  of  “ADA  positive”.  One  event  of  hypotension  was 
coincident with an ADA titer value of 40960 and study discontinuation. 
In  subjects  treated  with  EU-Tysabri,  5  events  were  reported  from  4  subjects;  3  of  the  events  were 
considered as being possibly-related to drug administration.

2.6.8.6.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Discontinuation due to adverse events occurred only in study PB006-03-01. 
Overall, 12 patients experienced TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation (8 [5.0%] patients in the 
PB006  group  and  4  [3.0%]  patients  in  the  Tysabri  group).  The  most  common  TEAEs  leading  to 
discontinuation in the PB006 group were pruritus (2 [1.5%] patients) and urticaria (2 [1.5%] patients), 
which are known common adverse drug reactions of natalizumab. One (0.8%) patient discontinued due 
to a TEAE of COVID-19. One (0.8%) patient experienced multiple TEAEs of asthenia, hyperhidrosis, blood 
pressure fluctuation, and dizziness after study drug infusion at Week 0. No treatment was given and all 
TEAEs  resolved,  but  the  patient  withdrew  from  the  study  following  the  events.  One  (0.8%)  patient 
experienced multiple TEAEs of ear infection and herpes simplex (an AESI) approximately 1 month after 
study drug infusion at Visit 5; both events resolved. The patient later experienced a TEAE of trigeminal 
neuralgia and was withdrawn from the study following these events. 
In the Tysabri group, 1 (0.8%) patient experienced multiple TEAEs of urticaria and angioedema (both 
AESIs) approximately 20 minutes after the start of the patient’s second Tysabri IV infusion. The infusion 
was  stopped  and  the  patient  was  treated  for  both  events.  The  events  of  angioedema  and  urticaria 
resolved and the patient withdrew from the study. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  assessment  of  safety  in  the  PB006  clinical  program  was  focused  on  the  comparison  of  PB006  to 
Tysabri. Safety data with PB006 were collected in studies PB006-01-02, PB006-01-03 and PB006-03-01. 
The principal safety data for PB006 and comparative safety data with Tysabri is derived from the pivotal, 
Phase  1,  single-dose  study  in  450  healthy  subjects  (PB006-01-03)  and  the  pivotal  Phase  3,  multiple-
dose study in 264 adult male and female RRMS patients (PB006-03-01) treated for up to 48 weeks (131 
patients  in  the  PB006  group  and  133  in  the  Tysabri  group  up  to  week  24;  afterwards  a  subset  of  30 
patients (22.6%) from the Tysabri group switched to PB006). Comparability of safety, tolerability and 
immunogenicity between the biosimilar candidate PB006 and the reference product, Tysabri EU, were 
secondary objectives of these studies. In both studies, safety analyses were based on the SAF, defined 
as all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug. In the Phase 3 study PB006-03-01, AESIs 
were defined in line with the SmPC of the reference product. Additional safety analyses were performed 
for the SSW population, defined as patients who received at least one infusion of study drug after the 
time point of re-randomization. 
The overall concept of the safety evaluation is considered adequate to conclude on similarity between 
PB006 and Tysabri EU and the safety database is considered sufficient for establishment of safety for

PB006 taking into account the well-known safety profile of the active substance and the fact that it is a 
biosimilar candidate.  
Non-conformity  with  GCP  was  described  for  one  of  the  study  centres  participating  in  the  safety  and 
efficacy study PB006-03-01. However, it was confirmed that all patients received the correct study drug 
and dose at all attended visits and there was no relevant impact on the safety data.  
The safety profile of the switch population is difficult to interpret, since it cannot always be determined, 
if events are due to treatment with the test or reference product. AEs are therefore not assessed in detail 
in this population. 
Overall, PB006 was administered to 159 healthy subjects as single dose (for 149 of these subjects at 3 
mg/kg, and for 10 of these subjects at 300 mg), and to 161patients with RRMS as multiple doses of 300 
mg in 4-weekly intervals  for up to 12  doses. Tysabri (US-Tysabri or EU-Tysabri) was administered to 
337 healthy subjects as single dose (1 to 6 mg/kg), and EU-Tysabri was administered to 133 patients 
with RRMS as multiple doses of 300 mg in 4-weekly intervals. 
The overall number of subjects (healthy volunteers and patients) exposed to the study drugs as well as 
the dose levels administered and the duration of exposure are considered adequate.  
In  study  PB006-01-03,  approximately  two-thirds  of  subjects  in  each  group  reported  any  TEAE,  and 
approximately  one  third  of  subjects  across  groups  had  study  drug-related  TEAEs.  No  fatal  TEAEs 
occurred. SAEs were reported for two subjects (1.3%; 6 SAEs overall) treated with US-Tysabri, while no 
SAEs occurred in the other two groups. No subject reported TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation.  
Most  frequently  reported  were  TEAEs  in  the  SOCs  nervous  system  disorders  (30-33%  across  groups) 
and general disorders and administration site conditions (29-34% across groups).  
On the PT level, most frequently reported was headache (26-30% across groups), followed by AEs related 
to the injection/infusion, with PTs of injection site reaction (18-21% across groups), infusion site reaction 
(1-4%  across  groups),  vessel  puncture  site  reaction  (1-5%  across  groups),  and  catheter  site  related 
reaction (2-3% across groups). 
In the majority of subjects (65.5%), TEAEs were mild and were reported with similar frequencies across 
the three study groups. Slightly more moderate TEAEs were reported in PB006 group (15 TEAEs in 11 
subjects (7.4%)) and in Tysabri US (19 TEAEs in 12 subjects (8.0%)) than in Tysabri EU (5 TEAEs in 4 
subjects (2.6%)). 
Slight differences were noted in the PTs Infusion site reaction and Pyrexia, which required follow-up as 
they could be indicative of immunogenic reactions to PB006. Of the 4 subjects with pyrexia events in 
study PB006-01-03, pyrexia did not occur in close temporal relationship to study drug infusion in the 3 
subjects  who  received  PB006  and    noneof  these  3  subjects  reported  concomitant  AEs  indicative  of  a 
systemic immunogenic reaction. Thus, it is unlikely that pyrexia was indicative of an immunological event 
in these subjects. Further it was assessed that the PT “infusion site reaction” was used only temporarily 
at one study site, and corresponds to PT “injection site reaction”. Overall, the frequency of injection site 
reaction was comparable across the 3 groups in study PB006-01-03.  
In study PB006-03-01, the overall percentages of patients with TEAEs and with TEAEs related to study 
drug were similar across groups. Approximately two-thirds of patients in each group reported any TEAE, 
while in approximately 25% of patients in each group, study drug-related TEAEs occurred. However, the 
frequencies of TEAEs of Grade 3 and of TEAEs leading to discontinuations were numerically higher in the 
PB006  group  than  in  the  other  groups.  Despite  minor  imbalances  observed  between  treatments,  the 
nature and frequency of these AEs reported in study PB006-03-01 correspond to the safety profile of the 
reference product Tysabri and thus do not give reason to concern.  
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 136/149 
 
 
 
The percentage of patients with study drug-related TEAEs was similar in the PB006, switch and the EU-
Tysabri  group  (23.7,  26.7  and  21.4%),  with  event  rates  per  100  PY  of  46.13,  54.90  and  56.40, 
respectively. 
Most  frequently  reported  in  both  groups  were  study  drug-related  TEAEs  in  the  SOCs  infections  and 
infestations, nervous system disorders and general disorders and administration site conditions. On the 
PT level, most frequently reported was headache, followed by dizziness.  
Though, on the level of individual PTs the frequencies slightly differed between groups. Most strikingly, 
distinctly more patients in the PB006 group (10 patients) had nervous system disorders compared to the 
Tysabri group (2 patients), mostly in the PT headache (7 versus 2 patients). However, these events were 
only graded as mild or moderate; they are known adverse drug reactions of natalizumab and do not give 
rise to concern.  
There were no fatal AEs in any of the studies conducted for this MAA.  
There were 6 SAEs reported for 2 subjects in the PK/PD study. All of these SAEs were unlikely related to 
study drug (based on investigator assessment) and were resolved within 1 or 2 days. 
There were 5 SAEs reported for 5 patients in the phase 3 study, 3 and 2 in the PB006 and Tysabri group, 
respectively. Three SAEs were not considered study drug related, 1 event of hypotension in the PB006 
group was considered possibly related and led to study drug discontinuation; one event of tremor in the 
control group was considered unlikely related. All events in the PB006 group resolved without sequelae, 
whereas the two SAEs in the Tysabri group resolved with sequelae.  
Adverse events of special interest were defined in the study protocol based on the Tysabri SmPC and 
included  PML,  JCV  granule  cell  neuropathy,  opportunistic  infection,  liver  injury,  hypersensitivity, 
encephalitis,  meningitis,  and  ARN.  The  overall  number  of  treatment  emergent  AESI  was  low  (approx. 
6%)  and  similar  between  groups.  The  most  frequently  reported  AESIs  were  events  of  urticaria  and 
herpes. 
Discontinuation  due  to  adverse  events  accounted  for  4.5%  overall  and  was  twice  as  abundant  in  the 
PB006  group  compared  to  the  Tysabri  group.  Most  common  TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation  were 
pruritus and urticaria, which are known and common adverse drug reactions of natalizumab. All of the 
events resolved. 
In both pivotal studies, increases from baseline in mean numbers of circulating leukocytes, lymphocytes, 
eosinophils and monocytes were reported, which were similar between treatment groups. The increases 
are  consistent  with  expression  of  α4β1  on  these  white-cell  subpopulations  and  are  a  known 
pharmacodynamic  effect  of  natalizumab  (Tysabri  SmPC).  Results  from  study  PB006-01-03  (which 
assessed laboratory parameters up  to and including 85  days post-dose) suggested that the increases 
were transient, with values returning to or below baseline levels at Day 85. 
In study PB006-03-01, AEs of anaemia were reported for 4 patients in the PB006 group versus none in 
the  Tysabri  group,  whereas  one  event  each  of  iron  deficient  anaemia  and  normocytic  anaemia  was 
observed in the Tysabri group. All of the anaemia events were judged as not related or unlikely related 
to study drug and none of the events was serious. Of note, anaemia has been reported as common AE 
for  Tysabri.  In  this  context,  the  findings  of  AEs  pertaining  to  anaemia  in  study  PB006-03-01  are  not 
considered to be unusual. 
The  use  of  natalizumab  has  been  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  PML,  an  opportunistic  infection 
caused by JCV, which may be fatal or result in severe disability. This virus also causes JCV granule cell 
neuronopathy which has been reported in patients treated with natalizumab. Symptoms of JCV GCN are 
similar to symptoms of PML (i.e. cerebellar syndrome). 
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 137/149 
 
 
 
The presence of anti-JCV antibodies is considered a risk factor for PML and it has been shown that the 
level of anti-JCV antibody response (index) is associated with the level of risk for PML in anti-JCV antibody 
positive natalizumab treated patients who have not used prior immunosuppressants (Tysabri SmPC).  
Thus, patients with anti-JCV antibodies were excluded from the phase 1 studies with PB006. Due to the 
relatively high prevalence of anti-JCV antibodies, patients presenting such antibodies could be enrolled 
into study PB006-03-01 but the index had to be below 1.5. Further, JCV status was a stratification factor 
at randomization. Further, all studies included a PML follow-up visit 6 months after (last) dosing with 
study drug, to assess neurological symptoms which could be suggestive of PML. 
Although  an  increase  in  JCV  index  was  observed  throughout  the  phase  3  study  with  approx.  6%  of 
patients having an index >1.5 at week 48, no cases of PML occurred in this study. No subjects had any 
signs suggestive of PML at the follow-up visit, either. 
Throughout clinical development of PB006, STRATIFY JCV DxSelect assay was used for screening of study 
subjects  and  as  risk  minimisation  during  the  biosimilar  clinical  studies.  In  parallel,  a  new  anti-JCV 
antibody assay was developed (ImmunoWELL JCV IgG test) for use in clinical practice.  
In  response  to  concerns  on  test  development  and  test  validation,  the  applicant  explained  that 
development and validation were performed on independent data sets and this approach is endorsed. 
The applicant further informed that there is no international reference standard for antibodies directed 
against JCV available. For this reason, the applicant developed the ImmunoWELL JCV IgG test with the 
intention  to  provide  the  same  readout  as  the  widely  used  and  established  STRATIFY  JCV  DXSelect, 
providing estimated values for the ImmunoWELL assay based on a regression fit with values from the 
STRATIFY JCV DxSelect test, to prove their agreement for healthy individuals and MS patients.  
In  order  to  rely  on  the  established  PML  risk  estimate  algorithm,  it  is  essential  that  the  ImmunoWELL 
assay produces comparable test results as the STRATIFY JCV DxSelect assay and reports index values 
on a comparable scale as the STRATIFY JCV DxSelect assay. The applicant provided further information 
on the ImmunoWELL JCV IgG test and its comparability with the current standard STRATIFY JCV DxSelect 
assay,  including  the  instructions  for  use,  the  analytical  and  the  clinical  validation  report  of  the 
ImmunoWELL JCV IgG test and the EC declaration of conformity. 
Although both tests (STRATIFY JCV DxSelect and ImmunoWell JCV IgG test) should reveal results on a 
comparable  scale,  the  difference  in  index  cut-off  values  between  the  two  tests  (0.2  –  0.4  for  the 
STRATIFY JCV DxSelect and 0.25 – 0.5 for the ImmunoWELL JCV IgG test) shows that the two tests are 
not  fully  identical.  For  justification  of  the  cut-off  values  0.25  and  0.5  for  Ab  negativity/positivity,  the 
applicant  referred  to  the  conducted  “cut-off  study”  and  stated  that  the  selection  of  0.25  and  0.5  was 
based on high sensitivity (>99%) and specificity (>90%), respectively. Details from the cut-off study 
were missing on the performance measures (sensitivity, specificity, NPV, PPV) for different cut-offs to 
understand the proceeding of cut-off selection. Although the actual question about justification of the 
cut-off of 0.25 and 0.5 was not answered in detail, it is acknowledged that CE-marking is available based 
on these. 
However,  the  applicant  was  asked  to  elaborate  on  their  proceeding  for  defining  the  chosen  range  for 
positivity/negativity (0.25-0.5). During the procedure, the applicant explained that the two JCV Ab tests 
are correlated and that decisions based on positivity cut-off are conservative based on the findings in 
the cohort of MS patients. While indeed, good correlation is observed in the cohort of MS patients, at 
first  only  subjects  with  a  value  <1.5  based  on  the  STRATIFY  JCV  DxSelect  test  were  included,  which 
could bias the regression fit. On request, the applicant presented further comparative test data from the 
healthy subject population across the whole index range, and based on a regression analysis it is implied 
that the ImmunoWELL JCV IgG test might slightly underestimate the index estimated from the STRATIFY 
JCV DxSelect test.  
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 138/149 
 
 
 
To address this potential difference in PML risk stratification, the applicant proposed to subtract an offset 
of 0.1 index values from the PML risk threshold values (0.9, 1.5) defined for the STRATIFY JCV DxSelect 
assay.  The  proposed  offset  is  based  on  an  analysis  that  includes  only  data  from  the  healthy  subject 
population;  ideally,  data  across  the  entire  patient  population  should  have  served  as  the  basis  for 
determining the proposed offset. The scatter plot of index values from ImmunoWELL JCV IgG test vs. 
STRATIFY JCV DxSelect test using data from MS patients presented in Section Clinical Safety, shows that 
both tests agree quite well except in the upper range, where the ImmunoWELL JCV IgG test appears to 
underestimate the anti-JCV antibody index from the STRATIFY JCV DxSelect test. This trend was also 
observed  for  healthy  subjects,  which  the  offset  was  established  from.  It  is  questionable  if  a  linear 
regression actually delivers the best fit for such a dataset over the full range of values. However, in the 
index  range  up  to  2.5,  that  clearly  goes  beyond  the  index  range  for  clinical decision  making,  a  linear 
regression appears appropriate, and estimated ImmunoWELL JCV IgG test values from this regression 
analysis  at  the  cut-offs  0.9  and  1.5  appear  similar  to  those  in  healthy  subjects.  Thus,  the  offset  (for 
deduction from the PML risk threshold values) based on healthy subjects is also considered appropriate 
in the cohort of MS patients and can be acceptable.  
Importantly, lowering the index levels by deducting an offset value for PML risk stratification based on 
the  ImmunoWELL  JCV  IgG  test  as  compared  to  the  STRATIFY  JCV  DxSelect  test  results  in  a  more 
conservative  approach  (compared  to  using  the  same  thresholds)  that  reduces  the  number  of  false 
negatives tests, i.e. the number of patients that would be eligible for treatment despite being at increased 
PML risk.  
The applicant reported the binary agreement between the two tests in terms of sensitivity, specificity, 
NPV, and PPV at the newly proposed threshold values of 0.8 and 1.4 for the ImmunoWELL JCV IgG test 
and at the threshold values of 0.9 and 1.5 for the STRATFIY JCV DxSelect test, for healthy individuals 
and MS patients, respectively.  Both analyses revealed performance measures (sensitivity, specificity, 
PPV and NPV) around 90% in healthy individuals as well as MS patients, which indicate that treatment 
decisions would be similar for most patients regardless of the applied JCV test. 
Eventually relevant specific information on risk stratification testing including applicable tests is provided 
as part of the educational material for healthcare professionals. 
In order to account for potential differences between the results of different anti-JCV antibody assays, 
the applicant provided a general wording for SmPC section 4.4 without the use of specific antibody index 
values.  
The applicant provided a comprehensive Integrated Summary of Immunogenicity presenting data from 
all three clinical studies where PB006 was administered. The analytical portfolio included a screening, 
confirmation  and  neutralisation  assay,  and  respective  methods  were  considered  suitable  for  their 
intended use. 
The  overall  data  showed  up  to  79%  ADA  positive  patients  in  the  phase  3  study.  The  peak  value  was 
observed  at  week  8  for  PB006  (65%  ADA  positive)  and  EU-Tysabri  (61%  ADA  positive),  declining 
progressively thereafter to 11% for PB006 and 10% for EU-Tysabri at week 48. Through to Week 24, in 
total, 79% of subjects in the PB006 treatment group were confirmed positive for treatment-emergent 
ADA  compared  to  74%  for  EU-Tysabri.  A  relatively  high  proportion  (approx.  87%)  of  ADA  positive 
subjects were also NAb positive. 
The relative numbers of ADA and NAb positive subjects are much higher than described in the Tysabri 
SmPC. The higher detected ADA and NAb incidence compared to the originator’s studies is most plausibly 
explained by superior drug tolerance of the methods applied in the PB006 program.  
Although ADA and NAb frequency declined progressively after reaching a peak at week 8, subjects with 
persistent ADA and NAb showed increasing titer levels up to and including week 48. 
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 139/149 
 
 
 
The applicant conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of ADA or NAb on PK, efficacy and 
safety parameters in the two pivotal clinical studies. 
Overall, no apparent differences in the treatment-emergent ADA or NAb profiles for PB006 compared to 
EU-Tysabri  (or  US-Tysabri),  or  in  impact  of  ADA  on  PK  or  PD  parameters  were  revealed  in  the  single 
dose comparative PK/PD study PB006-01-03 in healthy volunteers.  
Further, despite slightly  higher ADA and NAb levels in the PB006 compared to the Tysabri group, the 
immunogenicity  profile  of  PB006,  including  ADA/NAb  responses  and  the  impact  on  relevant  clinical 
parameters,  was  similar  to  that  of  EU-Tysabri  during  chronic  administration  for  48  weeks  to  RRMS 
patients in the pivotal safety and efficacy study, PB006-03-01.  
Overall, no clinically relevant differences in immunogenicity were detected between PB006 and Tysabri. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Considering the provided safety data from the clinical development programme, PB006 and Tysabri can 
be concluded to be biosimilar in terms of safety and immunogenicity.

2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Tysabri (text) and Ziextenzo (layout/design). The bridging 
report submitted by the applicant has been found acceptable. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant  to  Article  23(1)  of  Regulation  No  (EU)  726/2004,  Tyruko  (natalizumab)  is  included  in  the 
additional monitoring list as it is a biological product that is not covered by the previous category and 
authorised after 1 January 2011 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Biosimilarity assessment 
3.1.  Comparability exercise and indications claimed 
Natalizumab,  a  monoclonal  IgG4  antibody,  is  developed  to  have  the  same  intravenous  dosage  form, 
route  of  administration,  dosing  regimen  and  presentation  as  the  reference  product  EU-Tysabri.  The 
concentration  of  natalizumab  is  the  same  as  for  Tysabri  (20  mg/mL  in  15  mL)  but  the formulation of 
PB006 differs from the formulation of the reference medicinal product. 
The  marketing  authorization  is  claimed  for  treatment  of  multiple  sclerosis  for  the  following  patient 
groups: 
• Patients with highly active disease despite a full and adequate course of treatment with at least one 
disease modifying therapy (DMT). 
• Patients with rapidly evolving severe RRMS defined by 2 or more disabling relapses in one year, and 
with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing (GdE) lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or a 
significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI. 
Quality 
The  applicant  presented  detailed  information  about  its  comprehensive  analytical  assessment  to 
demonstrate  similarity  between  PB006  and  the  reference  medicinal  product  EU-Tysabri  (INN: 
natalizumab).  The  analytical  similarity  study  includes  PB006  (natalizumab)  data  from  batches 
manufactured  at  full  commercial  scale.  Biosimilarity  was  evaluated  against  an  appropriate  number  of 
batches of the reference medicinal product, EU-approved Tysabri.  
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 142/149 
 
 
 
The  relevant  quality  attributes  of  the  natalizumab  molecule  were  assessed  using  a  broad  panel  of 
orthogonal  standard  methods  that  are  state-of-the-art  and  are  suitable  to  characterise  and  compare 
relevant structural and functional features of the natalizumab PB006 in comparison to the RMP. Analytical 
methods cover primary and higher order structure, potency/binding and Fab arm exchange kinetics as 
well as purity and product related variants. For each parameter under investigation, the methodology 
and performance of the analyses was well described, batches used and experimental data derived were 
well presented including raw data or chromatograms/spectra where applicable. Based on the provided 
information  it  is  concluded  that  the  analytical  methods  are  suitable  and  sensitive  to  detect  minor 
differences. 
The quality attributes were either  evaluated against a min-max range (primary criterion) or assessed 
qualitatively. Generally, the critical quality attributes assessment was well described and the criticality 
ranking  can  be  followed.  Assigning  a  different  overall  risk  for  each  QA  considering  abundance, 
methodology and type of QA, is acceptable. 
Summary of clinical data 
Two  pivotal  clinical  studies  were  conducted  to  establish  clinical  similarity  between  PB006  and  the 
reference product, Tysabri. 
A  clinical  phase  1  study  was  conducted  to  demonstrate  comparability  in  PK  and  PD  of  the  biosimilar 
candidate PB006 and the reference medicinal product EU-Tysabri and US-Tysabri. Study PB006-01-03 
was  a  randomized,  double-blind  study  with  3  parallel  arms  in  453  healthy  male  and  female  subjects. 
Subjects received a single dose of 3 mg/kg PB006, EU-approved Tysabri, or US-licensed Tysabri as an 
IV infusion over a 60-minute period. Dosing was followed by PK and PD sampling for 85 days and a final 
follow-up  visit  6  months  (24  weeks)  after  dosing  to  assess  new neurological  symptoms  that  could  be 
suggestive  for  PML.  Safety  was  monitored  throughout  the  study  by  repeated  clinical  and  laboratory 
evaluations. Samples were collected for immunogenicity assessments for 85 days. 
The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate PK and PD similarity of PB006 to both US-licensed 
Tysabri and EU-approved Tysabri. 
The primary PK endpoint was AUC0-inf of total natalizumab, as secondary PK endpoints, AUC0-t, Cmax, and 
tmax of total natalizumab were selected to support the PK comparability of PB006 to EU-Tysabri and US-
Tysabri.  Further  secondary  PK  endpoints  were  AUC0-inf,  AUC0-t,  Cmax,  and  tmax  of  unexchanged 
natalizumab. The primary and secondary PK endpoints are in line with guidance (“Guideline on similar 
biological  medicinal  products  containing  monoclonal  antibodies  –  non-clinical  and  clinical  issues” 
(EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010)). 
For PD, two co-primary endpoints were selected: AUEC0-12w of baseline-adjusted CD19+, and AUEC0-12w 
of alpha-integrin % receptor saturation. As an additional analysis, AUEC4-12w for α4-integrin %RS was 
specified. As secondary PD endpoints, Emax and tmax of baseline-adjusted CD19+, AUECbase_neg, Emin, tmin 
of sVCAM and sMAdCAM, and AUEC0-t, Emax, tmax of CD34+ were used. 
The pivotal efficacy and safety study PB006-03-01 was conducted to compare PB006 to the EU reference 
product Tysabri in terms of efficacy, safety and immunogenicity.  
This  was  a  randomized,  double-blind,  active-controlled,  parallel-group  study  to  compare  the  efficacy, 
safety and immunogenicity of PB006 versus EU-Tysabri, and to demonstrate similarity between PB006 
and EU-Tysabri in patients with RRMS. 
A total of 265 patients were randomized and 264 patients overall were treated with study drug (131 and 
133 patients in the PB006 and Tysabri groups, respectively).

The dose of 300 mg, dosing frequency (once every 4 weeks), route and method of administration are in 
line with the SmPC of the reference product. The study was conducted over 44 weeks and 12 doses were 
administered to the PP population.  
The primary endpoint, cumulative number of new active lesions over 24 weeks, and secondary endpoints, 
i.e.,  cumulative  number  of  new  active  lesions  over  48  weeks,  cumulative  number  of  new  GdE  T1-
weighted lesions over 24 and 48 weeks, number of patients without new GdE T1-weighted lesions over 
24  and  48  weeks,  cumulative  number  of  new/enlarging  T2-weighted  lesions  over  24  and  48  weeks, 
number  of  patients  without  new/enlarging  T2-weighted  lesions  over  24  and  48  weeks,  number  of 
persistent  lesions  after  24  and  48  weeks,  annualized  relapse  rate  after  24  and  48  weeks  and  change 
from baseline in EDSS after 24 and 48 weeks are considered adequate to assess the clinical similarity 
between the biosimilar candidate and the reference product because they examine the effect on brain 
lesion activity and measure the delay of the disability, respectively. Moreover, the efficacy endpoints are 
in  line  with  the  “Guideline  on  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal  products  for  the  treatment  of  Multiple 
Sclerosis” (EMA/CHMP/771815/2011, Rev. 2), the efficacy endpoints studied in the clinical trials which 
supported the MA of the reference product, Tysabri EU and the “Guideline on similar biological medicinal 
products containing interferon beta” (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/652000/2010). 
3.2.  Results supporting biosimilarity 
Quality 
Analytical similarity assessment was based on the analysis of PB006 batches and an appropriate number 
of EU-approved Tysabri batches, based on a broad panel of orthogonal, sensitive and state of the art 
analytical  methods,  including  supportive  data  from  US-licensed  Tysabri  batches.  The  comparison 
included the assessment of strength, composition, physicochemical, biophysical and in vitro functional 
properties,  as  well  as  structural  characterisation  and  in-depth  assessment  of  isolated  product-related 
variants. Stability and degradation pathways were compared by a degradation study and by long-term, 
accelerated  and  stress  stability  studies.  Acceptance  ranges  were  pre-defined  as  min-max  ranges 
(primary criteria) and quality ranges (secondary criteria) for the EU-approved RMP, depending on their 
criticality, which was elaborated based on a comprehensive criticality assessment covering all relevant 
quality attributes. For all quality attributes including multiple attributes covering the mechanism of action 
high degree of analytical similarity of PB006 to the reference product EU-Tysabri has been demonstrated: 
Primary  structure  was  demonstrated  to  be  similar  by  100%  confirmation  of  the  sequence  (peptide 
mapping),  molecular  mass  analyses  (intact  and  deglycosylated),  and  the  same  locations  of 
posttranslational modifications (N-terminal pyroglutamic acid, oxidation, deamidation, N-glycosylation). 
Highly  similar  higher  order  structure  was  shown.  The  main  mechanism  of  action,  binding  to  the  α4-
subunit  of  α4β1  and  α4β7  integrins  expressed  on  the  surface  of  all  leukocytes  except  neutrophils 
inhibiting the α4-mediated adhesion of leukocytes to their counter-receptor(s) VCAM-1, and MAdCAM-1, 
was evaluated by ELISA method and SPR. Potency values of analysed PB006 batches were comparable 
to EU-Tysabri and US batches. It was also shown that PB006 lacks for immunogenic Galili-motifs present 
in EU-licensed Tysabri. Minor differences with regard to charge and size heterogeneity are not considered 
impactful.  Differences  were  observed  for  oxidation,  free  thiols,  open  disulfide  bonds,  C-terminal 
amidation, N-glycan profiles, and basic variants. The stability and degradation profiles of PB006 and its 
RMP  were  comparable.  The  observed  analytical  differences  have  been  adequately  justified  and  it  is 
agreed that their impact on safety and efficacy seems minor. In addition, analytical comparability of US-
Tysabri to EU-Tysabri has been sufficiently demonstrated as presented in a separate bridging report.

The  primary  PK  endpoint  AUC0-inf of  total  natalizumab  was  met.  The  ratio  of  the  pairwise  comparison 
PB006 vs EU-Tysabri was 0.9864, 90% CI: 0.9410, 1.0340. 
The secondary PK endpoints were supportive of similarity between PB006 and EU-Tysabri. 
Pharmacology/PD 
Both co-primary PD endpoints were met. 
AUEC0-12wk α4-integrin %RS: The ratio of the pairwise comparison PB006 vs EU-Tysabri was 1.0142, 95% 
CI:  0.9667,  1.0641.  The  ratio  of  the  comparison  of  PB006  vs  pooled  Tysabri  was  0.9933,  95%  CI: 
0.9523, 1.0362. 
AUEC0-12wk of baseline-adjusted CD19+: The ratio of the pairwise comparison PB006 vs EU-Tysabri was 
1.0163, 95% CI: 0.8787, 1.1754. The ratio of the comparison of PB006 vs pooled Tysabri was 1.0159, 
95% CI: 0.8955, 1.1525. 
The secondary PD endpoints were supportive of similarity between PB006 and EU-Tysabri. 
Efficacy  
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  cumulative  number  of  new  active  lesions  over  24  weeks  was  met.  The 
point estimate for the exponentiated difference between Tysabri and PB006 was 0.17 and the 95% CI (-
0.613; 0.944) for the difference Tysabri minus PB006 was narrow and well within the specified margins 
(-2.1; 2.1). 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were supportive of similarity between PB006 and EU-Tysabri. 
Safety and immunogenicity 
A comprehensive safety and immunogenicity evaluation was conducted in the two pivotal clinical trials. 
Overall, no clinically relevant differences in safety or immunogenicity were detected between PB006 and 
Tysabri. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about biosimilarity 
Clinical 
Pharmacology 
The study protocol was amended at several time points, with extensive changes to its design, including 
the primary  endpoints, sample size, study population, conduct  of the study  (introduction of a pooling 
criterion to allow pooling of results of EU- and US-Tysabri for PD evaluation), and evaluation of study 
results. However, no severe impact on study integrity was identified. 
Pharmacology/PD 
The relevance of the increase in CD19 positivity used as a co-primary PD endpoint is difficult to interpret. 
The  used  equivalence  margins  for  assessment  of  PD  endpoints  were  already  criticised  during  EMA 
scientific advice provided prior to study initiation as being too wide. Also, no sound scientific justification 
for the acceptance ranges was provided. 
No PD parameter was evaluated in the multiple-dose safety and efficacy study in patients.  
Efficacy  
The equivalence margin for the primary efficacy evaluation was based on a single reference study with 
small sample size and the predefined acceptance range was considered too large to rule out a clinically 
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 145/149 
 
 
 
relevant difference. However, the actual results accounted for a difference of less than one lesion and 
the  95%  CI  for  the  difference  between  the  treatments  displayed  a  narrow  range  of  [-0.613;  0.944]. 
These results are considered sufficient to demonstrate similarity in clinical efficacy. 
Safety and immunogenicity 
The  switch  of  30  patients  from  Tysabri  EU  to  PB006  at  week  24  is  considered  a  study  limitation  as  a 
comparative safety and immunogenicity assessment up to 48 weeks of the initial treatment groups PB006 
and Tysabri EU are considered more useful for the biosimilarity assessment. 
3.4.  Discussion on biosimilarity 
Overall, at the quality level similarity between PB006 and EU-sourced Tysabri, which was used as clinical 
comparator, could be demonstrated in a comprehensive analytical similarity exercise. In the PK/PD study 
EU-and  US-sourced  Tysabri  were  applied,  and  comparability  between  both  products  could  be 
demonstrated in the analytical similarity exercise.  
Overall, the clinical comparison between PB006 and EU-sourced Tysabri demonstrated biosimilarity in 
terms of the pre-defined primary parameters for PK, PD and efficacy. Additionally, the secondary PK and 
efficacy  parameters  support  the  conclusion  of  biosimilarity,  as  does  the  assessment  of  safety  and 
immunogenicity.

3.7.  Conclusions on biosimilarity and benefit risk balance 
Based  on  the  review  of  the  submitted  data,  Tyruko  is  considered  biosimilar  to  Tysabri.  Therefore,  a 
benefit/risk balance comparable to the reference product can be concluded. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Tyruko is favourable in the following indication(s): 
Tyruko is indicated as single disease modifying therapy in adults with highly active relapsing remitting 
multiple sclerosis (RRMS) for the following patient groups: 
•  Patients with highly active disease despite a full and adequate course of treatment with at least  
one disease modifying therapy (DMT) (for exceptions and information about washout periods see 
sections 4.4 and 5.1)  
or 
Assessment report  
EMA/359152/2023  
Page 146/149 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Patients with rapidly evolving severe RRMS defined by 2 or more disabling relapses in one year, 
and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) 
or a significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

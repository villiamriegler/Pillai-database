2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the virus that causes the Acquired Immune Deficiency 
Syndrome (AIDS). HIV infects and leads to a depletion of immune cells (CD4 + cells). As the CD4-positive 
cells are depleted, the host becomes increasingly susceptible to a variety of opportunistic pathogens and 
immune deficiency related diseases. In the absence of treatment, most infected individuals succumb to 
HIV-related disease. Many infected patients have been successfully treated with Highly Active 
Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART). The goal of HAART is to suppress HIV to undetectable levels so that 
immune function is preserved or restored. HIV infection in adults and children is a worldwide problem, 
both in developed and in developing countries. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS 
(UNAIDS) estimated the number of people living with HIV globally in 2012 was about 35.3 million. The 
number of people living with HIV has continued to increase as more patients are receiving antiretroviral 
therapy and living longer lives. While the number of people living with HIV has increased over the years, 
the number of new infections and deaths has decreased due to increased education and prevention 
efforts, increased access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), and effective prophylaxis and treatment of 
HIV-infected pregnant women and infected infants.  In 2012, there were approximately 2.3 million new 
infections, a decrease of approximately 33% from 2001, and 1.6 million people died from AIDS-related 
illnesses, a decrease from 2.3 million in 2005. The use of antiretroviral agents for treatment and 
prophylaxis during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding has reduced the rate of HIV transmission from 
mother to child. The annual number of newly infected children in 2012 was approximately 260,000 in low- 
and middle-income countries, 35% lower than in 2009. One of the major factors related to the success of 
antiretroviral regimens is adherence.  Drug adherence is directly related to clinical and virologic 
outcomes. High rates of drug adherence are associated with improved viral and clinical responses, 
durability of response and minimization of the emergence of drug resistance. There are many factors 
which negatively impact adherence in both the adult and paediatric populations. Among them are high pill 
burden, frequent dosing requirement, complexity of dosing regimens, dietary restriction and side effects.   
Atazanavir (Reyataz; ATV) is an azapeptide human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) protease 
inhibitor (PI). Atazanavir capsules (100, 150, 200, and 300 mg), in combination with low-dose ritonavir 
(RTV) as a pharmacoenhancer, has been approved for the treatment of HIV-1-infected adults and 
paediatric patients 6 to < 18 years of age in the European Union (EU) and many other countries globally.  
Cobicistat (Tybost; COBI), an inhibitor of cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3A enzymes, was developed by Gilead 
Sciences, Inc. (Gilead) for use as a pharmacoenhancer of 2 PIs, ATV and darunavir. Cobicistat is a new 
chemical entity that is a structural analogue of RTV. Cobicistat has no antiretroviral (ARV) activity, and in 
vitro, has been shown to be a more specific mechanism-based CYP3A inhibitor than RTV. To date, COBI 
as a single agent has been approved in the EU, Canada, Australia and USA. 
This application concerns a fixed dose combination of atazanavir, 300 mg, and cobicistat, 150 mg. The 
current adult dosage form for commercialization is an oval bilayer film-coated tablet containing 300 mg 
ATV as the free base and 150 mg COBI to be taken orally with food.  
Of note, cobicistat has already been the object of favourable assessment by the CHMP, either as a 
stan-alone procedure for the active principle (EMEA/H/C/002572) in which it has been approved for 
pharmacokinetic enhancement “of atazanavir 300 mg once daily or darunavir 800 mg once daily as part 
of antiretroviral combination therapy in human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infected adults” or in

fixed dose combination with anti-retroviral compounds (EMA/200486/2013 and 
EMA/CHMP/578742/2014), for the treatment of HIV infection in infected subjects carrying susceptible 
viral strains. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing atazanavir sulphate corresponding to 
300 mg of atazanavir and 150 mg of cobicistat as active substances.  
Other ingredients for tablet core are: microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, sodium starch 
glycolate, crospovidone, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, hydroxypropyl cellulose and silicon dioxide.  
Other ingredients for film-coating are: hypromellose (hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, E464), titanium 
dioxide (E171), talc, triacetin, red iron oxide. 
The product is available in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with a child resistant polypropylene 
closure and a silica gel desiccant. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
ATAZANAVIR SULPHATE 
General information 
The chemical name of atazanavir sulphate is dimethyl 
(3S,8S,9S,12S)-9-benzyl-3,12-di-tert-butyl-8-hydroxy- 
4,11-dioxo-6-[4-(2-pyridyl)benzyl]-2,5,6,10,13-pentaazatetradecanedioate, sulphate (1:1) and it has 
the following structure: 
The active substance is a white to pale yellow powder, freely soluble in organic solvents and slightly 
soluble in water (4-5 mg/ml). The solubility of the substance is pH dependant (maximum solubility at 
pH 1.9). 
The structure of atazanavir sulphate has been confirmed by elemental analysis, mass spectroscopy, 1H 
and 13C-NMR, IR, UV and single crystal X-ray analysis. 
EMA/517796/2015  
Page 9/98 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The substance contains four chiral centres however the manufacturing process leads, in a consistent way, 
to the single enantiomer S, S, S, S. The absolute configuration has been confirmed by single X-ray 
analysis on a triethanol solvate crystal. Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by specific optical 
rotation. 
Atazanavir sulphate shows polymorphism. It has been demonstrated that the commercial process 
produces exclusively a non-solvated, highly crystalline form designed as form A. 
The substance is not hygroscopic up to 75% relative humidity (RH), but undergoes solid-state 
modifications to a predominantly amorphous form in aqueous suspension and when exposed to 95% RH. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Atazanavir sulphate is synthesized at two different manufacturing sites in two main steps using well 
defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterised.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR and HPLC), assay (HPLC), 
impurity content (HPLC), optical rotation (USP), sulphuric acid, sulphated ash (Ph Eur), water content 
(KF), residual solvents (GC), heavy metals, particle size and EDAC content. 
The formation of the desired enantiomer of atazanavir is ensured through the route of synthesis and 
adequate controls performed on the starting materials and the intermediate of appropriate isomeric 
purity. Therefore, the omission of a chiral assay in the specifications has been supported in this particular 
case. 
Potential impurities have been well discussed. The suitability of the HPLC method for control of impurities 
including 4 significant stereoisomers has been demonstrated.  
Considering the consistency of results obtained by X-ray diffraction for a great number of batches, control 
of polymorphism is not part of the specification of the active substance. 
Specifications of the active substance are in adequacy with the route of synthesis and considered as 
appropriate. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis data of the active substance (4 production batches for one manufacturing site and 3 
production batches for the other manufacturing site) are provided. The results are within the 
specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on six production batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturing sites stored 
in the intended commercial package for 36 months or 24 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 
60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided.  
EMA/517796/2015  
Page 10/98 
 
 
  
 
 
The following parameters were tested: description, assay, water, impurities. The analytical methods used 
were the same as for release and were stability indicating.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
COBICISTAT 
General information 
The chemical name of cobicistat is 1,3-Thiazol-5-ylmethyl 
[(2R,5R)-5-{[(2S)-2-[(methyl{[2-(propan-2-yl)-1,3-thiazol-4-yl]methyl}carbamoyl)amino]-4-(morpho
lin-4-yl)butanoyl]amino}-1,6-diphenylhexan-2-yl]carbamate, corresponding to the structural formula 
below: 
The structure has been confirmed by mass spectroscopy, 1H and 13C-NMR, IR, UV , X-raypower 
diffraction, DSC, DVS. 
The molecular formula is C 40H53N7O5S2
and its relative molecular mass 776.0 g/mol. The active 
substance cobicistat is adsorbed on silicon dioxide. Cobicistat appears as a white to pale yellow, 
hygroscopic amorphous solid, soluble in 0.1N HCl pH 1.9, sparingly soluble at pH 4.5, practically insoluble 
in water and at pH 6.8-8.2, freely soluble in methanol. It shows three pKa; 1.8 (thiazole group), 2.5 
(alkylthiazole group) and 6.4 (morpholino group). The partition coefficient LogP is 4.3 (at pH 8.5 buffer). 
No crystal forms have been found. It has three chiral centres and is produced as a single isomer. The 
stereochemical configuration is defined through the synthetic process and the use of starting material 
with suitable chirality. Appropriate specifications for these starting materials ensure consistent quality 
during manufacture of cobicistat. 
Cobicistat is an amorphous solid with a low glass transition temperature of 35 ºC. Because of the low glass 
transition temperature, cobicistat under ambient conditions undergoes moisture and temperature 
induced phase transition from a foam into a rubber-like material. To increase physical stability of 
cobicistat it is adsorbed on silicon dioxide. Cobicistat on silicon dioxide is a white to pale yellow amorphous 
powder and, as cobicistat, it is also hygroscopic, as determined by dynamic vapour sorption at room 
temperature. The relatively higher water uptake of cobicistat on silicon dioxide compared to cobicistat is 
due to the hygroscopic nature of the silicon dioxide carrier. Importantly however and contrary to 
cobicistat itself, moisture uptake of cobicistat on silicon dioxide is reversible and therefore cobicistat is 
isolated by adsorption on silicon dioxide to provide a stable solid form, which is suitable for further 
finished product manufacture. 
EMA/517796/2015  
Page 11/98 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls  
Four sites are involved in the manufacture of the active substance with three of them involved only in the 
manufacture of a synthesis intermediate. Cobicistat on silicon dioxide is manufactured in ten well defined 
steps using well defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. The route of synthesis has been 
described in sufficient detail and adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The 
specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been 
presented. 
Specification 
Cobicistat on silicon dioxide specification includes tests and limits for appearance (visual), identification 
(cobicistat: IR, HPLC, UV, silicon dioxide: chemical reaction), water content (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), 
enantiomeric purity (chiral HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC) and heavy metals (Ph. Eur.).  
No crystal forms have been identified and since the active substance is produced as an amorphous solid 
adsorbed onto silicon dioxide, a test for polymorphism is not required as per ICH Q6A.  
Cobicistat genotoxic potential has been evaluated in accordance with the recommendations in ICH Q3A. 
All the identified impurities are of low concern for genotoxicity, and therefore no further qualification 
studies were considered necessary. The proposed test and limits are acceptable. 
A microbial limit test for the active substance is not required in accordance with ICH Q6A because the 
latter steps of the active substance manufacturing process are non-aqueous and have been shown to limit 
microbial content. In addition data presented on several batches during development indicate that no 
significant bioburden is present. 
All in-house analytical methods have been validated according to ICH Q2A principles. 
Batch analysis data for 7 representative large scale batches have been provided. In addition data for other 
batches used during development were also provided. The results comply with the specifications and 
confirm consistency and uniformity of the manufacturing process. 
Stability 
Two pilot scale batches packaged in a container simulating the proposed container were put on stability 
testing in accordance with the ICH Guideline under long-term conditions at 5 °C for up to 24 months for 
one batch and for up to 9 months for the other batch and accelerated at 25 °C/60% RH for up to 24 and 
9 months. Additional stability results are provided for batches manufactured by another manufacturing 
site.  
Appearance, water content, assay, impurities and chiral purity have been monitored. The analytical 
methods used are stability indicating. 
All physicochemical attributes of cobicistat on silicon dioxide remained within the specification acceptance 
limits following long-term storage at 5 °C and no apparent trend has been observed. A statistical analysis 
performed for assay, total impurities and the major chiral impurity also demonstrate that there is little 
change over time. The physicochemical attributes of cobicistat on silicon dioxide remained also within the 
specification acceptance limits following 24 months of storage at 25 °C/60% RH.  
Furthermore, one batch was also tested under 30 °C/75% RH for up to 6 months to evaluate the stability 
of cobicistat on silicon dioxide at elevated temperatures that may be encountered during shipping and 
handling. The duration of temperature and humidity excursions is limited to 3 months.  
EMA/517796/2015  
Page 12/98 
 
 
  
 
 
In addition, a photostability study was conducted on cobicistat on silicon dioxide according to ICH Q1B 
Guideline. The results showed no significant change in appearance, assay, and impurity content following 
exposure to light. The data indicate that cobicistat on silicon dioxide is not sensitive to light. 
Based on the presented stability data, the proposed re-test period and storage when the active substance 
is packed in the proposed packaging materials is acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The medicinal product has been developed to provide a fixed-dose combination (FDC) product containing 
the active pharmaceutical ingredient atazanavir and the pharmacoenhancer cobicistat on silicon dioxide 
in a single tablet. 
Both active substances are approved in the EU as standalone medicinal products and cobicistat is also 
approved as a component of the medicinal product Stribild (cobicistat, elvitegravir, emtricitabine and 
tenofovir). 
The pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements The quality target 
product profile (QTPP) was defined as a fixed dose combination film coated tablet containing 300 mg of 
the active substance atazanavir (ATV) and 150 mg of the active substance cobicistat (COBI) with 
bioequivalent ATV PK profile to one Reyataz 300 mg capsule dosed with one COBI 150 mg tablet, meeting 
compendial and other relevant quality standards, and packaged in HDPE bottles with desiccants. The 
critical quality attributes identified were appearance, assay, impurities/degradation product content, 
content uniformity and dissolution. 
The formulation has been developed based on prior formulation experience with other authorised 
medicinal products, initial screening studies, and design of experiment (DOE) studies. The film-coating 
system was chosen because it offers good chemical and physical compatibility with both ATV and 
cobicistat on silicon dioxide.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. and 
USP standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
There is a polymorphic form change of ATV active substanceduring the granulation process.The 
development of the manufacturing process has focussed on optimisation to ensure integrity and sufficient 
strength of the bilayer interface and thus avoid delamination of the tablets on storage. 
A bioequivalence study was conducted comparing the ATV/COBI FCT (1 x 300/150 mg) with the Reyataz 
capsule (1 x 300-mg) co-administered with a COBI tablet (1 x 150-mg). A detailed assessment of the 
bioequivalence study is presented in the clinical section. The results showed that the ATV/COBI FCT is 
bioequivalent to Reyataz capsules co-administered with COBI tablets when given with a light meal. 
The composition, manufacturing process, size and shape of the ATV/COBI FCT used in the 
bioequivalence/ registration stability study is the same as that used for the proposed commercial tablets. 
One of the sites used for the manufacture of the bioequivalence batch is not the manufacturing site 
proposed for marketing however, the equipment is representative of that intended for commercial 
manufacture and the batches comply with the proposed specification.  
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. However the dissolution 
method does not have the discriminating capability with regards to polymorphic form of atazanavir and to 
EMA/517796/2015

active substances’ particle size.  Particle size distribution is controlled in the atazanavir specifications. The 
absence of particle size control in the cobicistat specifications was considered justified. 
The primary packaging is a high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with a child resistant polypropylene 
closure and a silica gel desiccant. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of 
the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of 
the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of five main steps: preparation of two separate blends, granulations, 
compression, tablet coating, packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing 
process. The critical steps are identified.  
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies performed at all 
commercial manufacturing sites. Parametric controls performed ensure that consistent atazanavir 
polymorphic form conversion occurs during the manufacturing process. 
Holding times for intermediates are validated. 
It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of 
manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
description, identification (IR, HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), 
impurities/degradants, dissolution, microbial limits. 
The absence of water content control and atazanavir polymorphic form control in the specifications were 
considered justified. 
The in-house analytical procedures are described and validated.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing.  
Batch analysis results are provided for 15 commercial scale batches manufactured at the proposed 
manufacturing sites confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to 
manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of 3 commercial scale batches of finished product stored under long term conditions for 18 
months at 5˚C, 25 ºC / 60% RH, 30°C/75%RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 
ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches are identical to those proposed 
for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for assay and identification (HPLC), impurities and degradants, water content (KF), 
water activity, hardness, appearance, microbial limit test, content uniformity and dissolution. 
The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
Laboratory stability studies data were provided to demonstrate that there is no change in the polymorphic 
form from the initial time point up to 18 months at 30°C/75%RH conditions. The absence of identification 
EMA/517796/2015  
Page 14/98 
 
 
  
 
 
test for atazanavir polymorphic form in the shelf life specification of the finished product was therefore 
considered justified. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products and to stress conditions. The photostability study indicated that the 
finished product does not need to be protected from light. The freeze/thaw cycling and higher 
temperature stress data support shipping of the medicinal product through normal distribution channels. 
Results from a 12-month open-dish stability study conducted at 25°C/60%RH were provided. The results 
demonstrate that the finished product remains stable when directly exposed to 25ºC/60%RH in an open 
dish for 12 months and justify the proposed in-use shelf-life. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life is 2 years and the storage condition  is “Do not store above 
30°C”. They are acceptable and included in the SmPC. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The bilayer formulation has been selected considering the 
physicochemical stability of the two active substances. The formulation development was based on prior 
formulation experience with other approved  medicinal  products.The finished product manufacturing 
process is considered to be standard process and has been satisfactorily validated by appropriate process 
validation studies. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important 
product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

The HIV-1 protease is a 99 amino acid aspartyl protease encoded in the N-terminal domain of the pol 
gene. This protein forms a homodimeric enzyme with 1 active site. ATV selectively inhibits the virus 
specific processing of viral Gag-Pol proteins in HIV-1 infected cells, thus preventing formation of mature 
virions. Due to the hydrophobic nature of the binding pocket of HIV protease, HIV PIs have reduced 
aqueous solubility and bind to serum proteins. Relative to other marketed HIV PIs, ATV retains superior 
antiviral activity in the presence of ≥40% human serum. 
The structure of ATV is illustrated below 
Cobicistat 
Cobicistat (COBI) is a small molecule mechanism-based cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inhibitor with 
micromolar potency and a CYP3A substrate. COBI is used as a pharmacoenhancer when bioavailability 
and half-life are reduced due to CYP3A-dependent metabolism.  
COBI is a structural analogue of RTV and similarly boosts systemic exposure to ATV (CYP3A substrate). In 
vitro, COBI is a more specific, mechanism-based CYP3A inhibitor than RTV, indicating that COBI may have 
fewer adverse biochemical effects than RTV. Unlike RTV, which has modest activity against HIV, COBI has 
no antiviral activity against HIV-1, hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C virus and does not antagonize the 
antiviral effects of HIV inhibitors.  
The structure of COBI is illustrated below. 
Complete nonclinical profiles of ATV and COBI were established in comprehensive investigational 
programs that included single-agent in vitro pharmacology studies, as well as in vitro and in vivo safety 
pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and metabolism, and toxicity (including toxicokinetics) studies. To 
support the combination of ATV + COBI, the Applicant conducted a combination toxicology study in rats. 
No new nonclinical pharmacology studies were conducted to support this application. Based on available 
data, no relevant adverse pharmacological or virological interactions are expected.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
In an ex vivo study of cardiac electrophysiology in rabbit hearts, ATV and COBI were infused in situ by 
retrograde perfusion of the aorta. Hearts were exposed for 15 minutes at concentrations of ATV, COBI, or 
EMA/517796/2015  
Page 16/98 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
ATV/COBI. ATV (1.5, 4.5, 15, and 45 µM), COBI (0.15, 0.45, 1.5, and 4.5 µM), or ATV/COBI (1.5/0.045, 
1.5/0.15, 1.5/0.45, 1.5/1.5 µM). 
Criteria for evaluation included left ventricular (LV) function (reduced developed pressure, contractility, 
relaxation, and coronary perfusion pressure), heart rate, QT, QRS, and PR intervals, monophasic action 
potential duration at 30%, 50%, and 90% repolarization, action potential triangulation, and appearance 
of early after depolarizations on the monophasic action potential waveform. At each concentration of test 
article, mean values were compared to baseline. 
Both single agents produced effects on LV contractility (≤50;≥15µM ATV, ≥15µM COBI) and PR 
prolongation(≤62%; ≥15 µM ATV, ≥4.5 µM COBI). The Applicant goes onto say that when administered 
in combination, it was concluded that these effects were not clearly additive. The no-observed effect 
levels (NOEL) for hemodynamic, electrophysiology, and electrocardiographic parameters of the 
single-agents and ATV + COBI in combination were 4.5 µM ATV, 0.45 µM COBI, and 1.5/0.45 µM 
ATV/COBI.  
No additive or synergistic cardiovascular effects of ATV + COBI have been observed to date in clinical 
studies.  
Atazanavir 
In the in vitro Purkinje fibre assay, atazanavir was shown to increase action potential duration (13% 
increase at 30 μM which is four times the Cmax and 17 times the Css in humans at a 400 mg dose). 
Furthermore, atazanavir-related effects on sodium, potassium, and calcium currents were evaluated in 
vitro. Atazanavir weakly inhibited sodium and HERG-encoded potassium currents (IC50>30 μM) while 
moderately inhibiting calcium currents (IC50 of 10.4 μM). Electrocardiographic changes (sinus 
bradycardia, prolongation of PR interval, prolongation of QT interval, and prolongation of QRS complex) 
were only observed in an initial 2-week oral toxicity study and not in subsequent 2-week and 9-month oral 
toxicity studies performed in dogs. 
Cobicistat 
In the isolated heart of the rabbit, shortening of the monophasic action potential duration (MAPD) was 
also observed at ≥ 1 µM. In addition, COBI was associated with a significant increase in coronary 
perfusion pressure (at ≥1.5 µM), decrease in ventricular function (at ≥1 µM; possibly secondary to 
interaction with cardiac calcium channels and/or the observed increase in perfusion pressure), decrease 
in the QT interval and increase in the PR and RR interval at ≥ 3 µM. In vivo, no significant effect on QT 
interval was observed in the dog, following single oral doses of up to 45 mg/kg. Increases in PR interval 
were noted at ≥15 mg/kg where the plasma levels were reported to be 3.2 to 4.9 fold higher than that 
observed clinically. 
Combination atazanvir and cobicistat 
No additional studies were performed with the combination of atazanavir and cobicistat. This was 
considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No nonclinical drug interaction studies have been provided with the fixed dose combination product.  The 
Applicant states that no drug-drug interaction studies have been performed using ATV/COBI FDC tablet 
formulations. The applicant stated that that PK drug-interaction studies with the individual components of 
EMA/517796/2015  
Page 17/98 
 
 
  
 
 
the FDC (either ATV or COBI) have been conducted, and based on these data, as well as the known impact 
of ATV or COBI on CYP enzymes and transporters, drug interactions are anticipated with the ATV/COBI 
FDC no specific drug-interaction studies have been conducted. This was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
The drug-drug interaction potential of ATV/COBI is discussed in the clinical section. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new nonclinical pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to support the ATV/COBI FDC tablet, which 
was considered acceptable by the CHMP. Based on available data, a pharmacokinetic interaction between 
ATV and COBI is not expected. Both ATV and COBI have in general low propensity for clinically significant 
pharmacokinetic interactions with other co-administered drugs. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
A 3-month oral combination toxicity study was conducted in rats (GS Study TX-216-2024) in which ATV 
and COBI were given daily, either alone or in combination (ATV/COBI: 0/0 (vehicle), 20/30, or 50/30 
mg/kg/day) and 3-month qualification rat study (BMS Study DM13009) was carried out to evaluate 
degradation products of COBI observed in the ATV/COBI drug product. Cobicistat unspiked or spiked with 
degradants was given to animals by oral gavage at doses at 0 (vehicle) or 30 mg/kg/day (both sexes).  
Apart from these studies no combination safety assessment studies have been conducted with ATV and 
COBI.  An extensive number of nonclinical toxicity studies, previously conducted for each agent 
individually and submitted in support of this application, were reviewed.   
In summary, the individual safety assessment programs supporting ATV and COBI clinical use included 
safety pharmacology studies, acute and repeated dose oral studies, developmental and reproductive 
toxicity studies, a battery of both in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies and rodent carcinogenicity 
studies. All pivotal nonclinical toxicity studies were conducted consistent with International Conference on 
Harmonisation (ICH) Nonclinical Testing Guidelines and in compliance with the Good Laboratory Practice 
(GLP) Regulations.  
The rat and dog were chosen as the nonclinical toxicology species for both ATV and COBI development.  
Repeated dose toxicity studies with ATV and COBI were both conducted for up to 6 months in rats and 9 
months in dogs. Developmental and reproductive toxicity was determined in rats and rabbits, and an 
assessment of carcinogenicity conducted in mice and rats.  All pivotal studies were supported by 
toxicokinetic measurements.  
Toxicokinetic data 
90-Day Oral Gavage Bridging Study with GS-9350 and Atazanavir in Rats with a 1-Month 
Recovery Period (TX-216-2024) 
ATV/COBI was given orally at doses of 0/0 (vehicle), 20/30, or 50/30 mg/kg/day to both sexes. ATV and 
COBI were administered alone at 20 or 50 mg/kg/day and 30 mg/kg/day, respectively. All doses were 
administered at 2 mL/kg. Survival, toxicokinetics, clinical observations, body weight, food consumption, 
ophthalmologic examinations, clinical pathology evaluations, organ weights, and gross and microscopic 
pathology were evaluated. Combined administration of ATV (AUC ≤ 45.1 µgh/mL) + COBI (AUC ≤ 6.22 
µgh/mL) was well tolerated (in-life) at 20/30 or 50/30 (ATV/COBI) mg/kg/day.  
EMA/517796/2015

Slight increases in cholesterol (≤ 1.7x control) were observed primarily in females given COBI and ATV 
alone and in combination at both doses. These increases were not considered adverse as they were low 
magnitude, not observed in males, and no microscopic correlate was present. Urine volume was slightly 
higher in males at 50 mg/kg/day ATV and 30 mg/kg/day COBI and in both sexes at 20/30 or 50/30 
mg/kg/day ATV/COBI. Following the recovery period, cholesterol levels in females and urine volume were 
similar to control values, indicating reversibility.  
Slight increases in absolute and relative (to body weight) mean liver weight values were noted at 30 
mg/kg/day COBI, either alone or in combination with ATV. No organ-weight changes were observed in 
animals given ATV alone. This finding had no histomorphologic correlate and was considered likely a 
COBI-related induction of liver microsomal P450 enzyme.  
Administration of ATV and COBI either alone or in combination resulted in no notable increase (≥2x) in 
protein yield, total cytochrome P450 content, or CYP1A, CYP2B, CYP2B/2C, CYP2E, CYP4A, and UDPGT 
activities. However, increases in CYP3A activity were observed in males and females at 30 mg/kg/day 
COBI (2.1 and 5.6x, respectively) and in females at 30/20 and 30/50 mg/kg/day COBI/ATV (3.5 and 2.6x, 
respectively). 
Daily oral administration of ATV and COBI to rats for 3 months at doses ≤50 mg/kg/day for both ATV (Day 
90 mean combined-sex AUC ≤ 45.1 µgh/mL) and COBI (Day 90 mean combined-sex AUC ≤ 7.89 µgh/mL) 
showed no toxicological interaction and COBI-induced increases of ATV systemic exposures were evident. 
All drug-related findings were minor and consistent with previous single-agent studies with these 
compounds. 
For ATV dosed in combination with COBI, AUC values were ≤ 4x when compared to AUCs when ATV was 
dosed at the same dose (≤ 50 mg/kg/day) as a single agent in this study. Increases in ATV AUC values on 
Day 90 were less than dose proportional and AUC values were similar in males and females. Following 
repeated dosing, mean ATV AUC values were similar to Day 1, suggesting a low potential for 
accumulation. 
For COBI dosed in combination with ATV, increases in COBI AUC values on Day 90 were less than dose 
proportional in males and approximately dose proportional in females; and AUC values were generally 
lower in males than in females (0.4 to 0.9x). Following repeated dosing, mean COBI AUC values were 
slightly higher (1.5 to 2.0x) than on Day 1, suggesting potential for accumulation. Day 90 COBI AUC 
values were lower (0.1 to 0.6x) when co-administered with ATV than when administered alone.

Data on individual active substances 
Atazanavir  
In safety pharmacology studies, there were no test article-related adverse effects on, respiratory, or 
central nervous system function in rats (≤ 1200 mg/kg/day) or dogs (≤ 360 mg/kg/day).  
In the in vitro Purkinje fibre assay, atazanavir was shown to increase action potential duration (13% 
increase at 30 μM (4x Cmax and 17 x the Css in humans at a 400 mg). There were also effects on sodium, 
potassium, and calcium currents were evaluated in vitro. ATV weakly inhibited sodium and 
HERG-encoded potassium currents (IC50>30 μM) while moderately inhibiting calcium currents (IC50 of 
10.4 μM). Electrocardiographic changes (sinus bradycardia, prolongation of PR interval, prolongation of 
QT interval, and prolongation of QRS complex) were observed in an initial 2-week oral toxicity study, 
however these effects were not seen in the subsequent 2-week and 9-month oral toxicity studies in dogs.  
The metabolic pathways of atazanavir involve monooxygenation, dioxygenation, glucuronidation, 
N-dealkylation, hydrolysis and oxygenation with dehydrogenation. Several oxidative, but no conjugated 
metabolites of atazanavir were detected following incubation with mouse, rat, dog or human liver 
microsomes and cryopreserved hepatocytes. CYP3A4 is the major isozyme responsible for the 
metabolism of atazanavir in human liver microsomes.  
EMA/517796/2015  
Page 20/98 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Atazanavir shown to be a competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4, with a Ki value of 2.35 μM; in comparison, the 
Ki of ketoconazole for CYP3A4 in this system is < 0.1 μM. Atazanavir was also found to competitively 
inhibit CYP1A2 and CYP2C9, but the Ki values were appreciably higher (≥12.2 μM) than the steady state 
plasma concentrations of atazanavir observed in humans following 400 mg doses. In another study, 
atazanavir inhibited testosterone 6 β-hydroxylation (marker of CYP3A4 activity) by 61-92% in primary 
human hepatocytes and immortalised human hepatocytes transfected with CYP3A4. Atazanavir did not 
induce testosterone 6 β-hydroxylation in primary human hepatocytes, indicating that it is not an inducer 
of CYP3A4 in vitro. 
Atazanavir was found to inhibit bilirubin glucuronidation in microsomal fractions of lymphoblast 
cellsheterologously expressing human uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) by a 
linear “mixed-type ” mechanism, with Ki and α-Ki (measure of affinity of enzyme-substrate complexfor 
the inhibitor) values of 1.9 and 16.4 μM, respectively. However, the contribution of αKi to overall 
inhibition was small (< 10%) suggesting that competitive inhibition is predominant. Indinavir also 
exhibited inhibition of bilirubin glucuronidation by a similar mechanism, but had a higher Ki (47.9μM) and 
αKi (1317 μM) than atazanavir. The IC50 values for the inhibition of bilirubin glucuronidation in human 
liver microsomes and cDNA expressed UGT1A1 were similar for atazanavir (2.5 and 2.4 μM, respectively) 
and nelfinavir (2.7 and 8.4 μM, respectively) and saquinavir (5.0 and 7.3 μM, respectively), but were 
appreciably lower than the value for indinavir (68 and 87 μM, respectively). However, the IC50 values for 
these other drugs were > 13 fold above the respective unbound Cmax values at the therapeutic doses 
compared to ~ 2.4 fold above the unbound Cmax for atazanavir. 
In repeat-dose toxicity studies, ATV was given to rats (up to 1200 mg/kg) in a two weeks study. Reduced 
food consumption and signs of dehydration were noted suggesting that this dose was close to the 
maximal tolerable level. The liver was the main target organ with hypertrophy, vacuolisation, increased 
weight and increased levels of bilirubin noted. No signs of cholestasis were seen. Cholesterol levels were 
increased at ≥300 mg/kg. Haematological parameters were also slightly affected with a reduction in 
white blood cell noted at ›300 mg/kg. Glucose levels were increased at 1200 mg/kg. All these effects were 
mainly observed in females due to a higher exposure (1.2 to 3.2 fold compared to males). 
In the three and six months studies ATV was administered at up to 900 mg/kg in rats. Again the liver was 
the main target organ with the same signs that were observed in the two weeks study. At six months 
animals showed an increase in water consumption and of urine volume suggesting that animals were 
dehydrated. The NOAEL was less than 100 mg/kg. 
In repeat-dose toxicity studies in dogs, ATV was administered at up to 360 mg/kg in a two weeks study. 
Doses higher than 90 mg/kg were poorly tolerated. A second study of the same duration was then 
undertaken with doses up to 75 mg/kg. This dose was well tolerated with no effects observed. 
In a 9-month pivotal study, dogs were given doses of up to 90 mg/kg. This doses was very well tolerated 
the 10 mg/kg dose was raised to 180 mg/kg, 3 months after the beginning of the study. Consequently, 
animals of the first group were treated for 3 months at 10 mg/kg and 6 months with 180 mg/kg. Results 
showed that increased levels of bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyltransferase. Not all 
the animals showed these effects. No signs of cholestasis were reported in this study.  
Atazanavir was shown to be clastogenic in vitro. It was shown that ATV did not induce DNA damage in 
duodenum (UDS and comet assay), or unscheduled DNA repair in liver (UDS) at plasma and tissue 
concentrations exceeding those that were clastogenic in vitro. The increase in chromosome aberrations 
was reproducible in the second in vitro primary human lymphocyte assay, thus confirming that ATV is 
clastogenic in vitro. The mechanism for in vitro clastogenicity is not known. However given that ATV did 
not induce micronuclei, DNA damage (comets), or UDS in a variety of rodent tissues in vivo at plasma and 
EMA/517796/2015  
Page 21/98 
 
 
  
 
 
tissue concentrations exceeding those that were clastogenic in vitro, suggests that the mechanism of in 
vitro clastogenicity may not be biologically relevant in animals and humans. 
In reproductive and developmental toxicity studies one study conducted in both sexes at doses up to 1400 
mg/kg, showed a decreased in fertility rate at 1400 mg/kg and a significant reduction in the number of 
oestrus cycles at 375 mg/kg. Consequently, males from this study were placed in cohabitation with 
untreated females for 2 weeks. Mating and fertility were not affected in males at any dose. No effect on 
fertility was observed when treated females (1400 mg/kg) were mated with non-treated males. In the 
embryo-foetal development studies, AT produced no adverse embryonic or foetal effects at maternally 
toxic doses of up to 1920 mg/kg/day in rats and 60 mg/kg/day in rabbits. ATV induced a decrease in body 
weight at weaning at maternally toxic doses (1000 mg/kg). 
The results obtained in the carcinogenicity studies showed that ATV induced hepatocellular adenoma in 
female mice at the highest dose tested (360 mg/kg/day). This observation is probably due to an 
epigenetic mechanism with hepatocyte hyperproliferation after cell necrosis (for which investigative 
studies were conducted), which is a well-known mechanism, observed in rodents. In this mouse study, 
liver carcinomas were not present, and in rats, all the results were negative. All together, these results 
suggest that atazanavir will not increase the carcinogenic risk in humans.  
The nonclinical safety evaluation of ATV also demonstrated that this compound was generally 
well-tolerated.  
Cobicistat 
In an isolated heart of the rabbit safety pharmacology study, shortening of the monophasic action 
potential duration (MAPD) was also observed at ≥1 µM. In addition, COBI was associated with a 
significant increase in coronary perfusion pressure (at ≥1.5 µM), decrease in ventricular function (at ≥1 
µM; possibly secondary to interaction with cardiac calcium channels and/or the observed increase in 
perfusion pressure), decrease in the QT interval and increase in the PR and RR interval at ≥3 µM. 
However, in vivo, no significant effect on QT interval was observed in the dog, following single oral doses 
of up to 45 mg/kg. Increases in PR interval were noted at ≥15 mg/kg where the plasma levels were 
reported to be 3.2 to 4.9 fold higher than that observed clinically. 
The effects of COBI (0.45 to 1.5 μM)/ATV (1.5 μM) were evaluated in the rabbit isolated heart. The effects 
on HR and PR interval appeared to be more pronounced when ATV (1.5 μM) and COBI (1.5 μM) were 
administered in combination; however, the observed differences were not considered to be clinically 
significant. During this study, COBI alone had no effect on the QT interval or MAPD at up to 1.5 μM.  
In vitro metabolism in all species yields 3 predominant primary oxidative metabolites [M21, M26, and 
M31 (GS-9612)]. Cobicistat is metabolised rapidly by hepatic microsomal fractions from non-clinical 
species, but exhibits self-limiting metabolism with human hepatic microsomal fractions, due to 
concurrent enzyme inactivation. CYP3A (major) and CYP2D6 (minor) enzymes appear to be responsible 
for the in vitro human metabolism of COBI. 
There were no effects in rats and mice given single doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day and 500 mg/kg 
respectively. 
The oral NOAEL of COBI in CD-1 mice for 13 weeks was 50 mg/kg/day and 5 mg/kg/day in males. The oral 
NOAEL was 30 mg/kg/day in rats for 26 weeks and the oral NOAEL was 10 mg/kg/day in dogs for 39 
weeks. 
The primary target organs were the liver (mouse, rat, and dog) and thyroid (rat only) in repeat dose 
toxicology studies. In the rat, the observed effects on the thyroid (increased thyroid weight and follicular 
EMA/517796/2015  
Page 22/98 
 
 
  
 
 
hyperplasia/hypertrophy), are considered rodent-specific, secondary to microsomal enzyme induction 
and thyroid hormone imbalance (decreased levels of T4 and thyroid-stimulating hormone), and it is 
unlikely that COBI presents a risk to the thyroid in man. 
Hepatic changes in mice, rats, and dogs included microsomal enzyme induction [CYP2B (mouse only) and 
CYP3A (in mouse and rat only)], increased liver weights, and hepatocellular hypertrophy and/or 
vacuolation. All effects appeared to be completely reversible after a 1- or 3-month recovery period and/or 
are considered to be adaptive responses 
No adverse effects were seen on male or female fertility and reproductive performance at up to 100 
mg/kg/day, where the corresponding exposures (AUC) are at least 3 fold higher than that observed 
clinically. Increased post-implantation loss and skeletal variations (ossification changes in the spinal 
column and sternebra) along with decreased foetal weights (associated with significant decreases in 
maternal body weights) were observed at 125 mg/kg/day in the rat embryofoetal development study. 
The exposures at the no-effect level for embryo/fetal viability and growth and developmental toxicity 
were similar to that proposed clinically. In the rabbit, there were no test article-related effects on 
embryo/foetal viability and growth and no foetal anomalies at systemic exposures that were 6 fold higher 
than that proposed clinically. 
The results from a bacterial reverse mutation test, mouse lymphoma assay and in vivo rat micronucleus 
assay all indicate that cobicistat does not pose a genotoxic risk to man. 
COBI was not carcinogenic at exposures that were 7 to 16 fold higher than those observed clinically in the 
mouse (95 weeks (males) or 87 weeks (females)). In the rat at 10, 25, and 50 mg/kg/day (males) and 5, 
15, and 30 mg/kg/day (females) for a minimum of 97 weeks, COBI caused an increased incidence of 
combined thyroid follicular cell adenoma and carcinomas at exposures (AUC) that were lower than that 
observed clinically. Thyroid and liver changes are considered adaptive changes, secondary to hepatic 
microsomal enzyme induction due to activation of PXR. Given that this extent of activation of PXR and 
CYP3A does not occur at clinically relevant concentrations in humans, COBI is not considered to pose a 
carcinogenic risk in man.  
Qualification study 
Based on identification of COBI-related degradants in a laboratory stability study of the ATV + COBI FDC 
tablet, a 3-month oral qualifying toxicity study in rat was conducted to compare the toxicity of a 
COBI-spiked batch (COBI-SP) with the toxicity profile of COBI not spiked (COBI-NS) with degradants. The 
spiked batch contained 4 degradation products (BMT-111068/BMT-111069, an isomeric mixture, 
BMT-089290, and BMT-115982). The results of this study were used to qualify batches of ATV + COBI 
drug product that potentially contain these degradants at approximately ≤1.5% each (total degradant 
level of approximately 4.6%). COBI-NS and COBI-SP was given to animals at 30 mg/kg/day. As COBI is 
an amorphous adsorbate on SiO2, the amount of SiO2 present in COBI formulations was added to the 
vehicle-control formulation. Survival, toxicokinetics of COBI in plasma, clinical observations, body 
weights, food consumption, physical and ophthalmologic examinations, clinical pathology, organ weights, 
and gross and microscopic pathology were assessed.  
There were no deaths, and COBI-NS and COBI-SP were well tolerated (n-life) with no effects on body 
weight, food consumption, physical or ophthalmologic findings, or gross pathology. The following were 
observed (with generally similar onset, incidence, and/or severity) in both COBI groups: red-stained or 
wet fur of the muzzle/lower jaw, cranium and/or dorsal cervical, slight to moderate salivation, decreased 
red blood cells (0.93 to 0.94x control), haemoglobin (0.92 to 0.93x), and haematocrit (0.91 to 0.94x) in 
males, decreased prothrombin time (0.93 to 0.97x), decreased total bilirubin (0.43 to 0.59x), alkaline 
phosphatase (0.71 to 0.81x; males only), and aspartate aminotransferase (0.62 to 0.69x; females only)

activities and total cholesterol (0.82 to 0.88x; males only), increased globulins (1.12 to 1.19x) with 
corresponding increased total protein (1.05 to 1.07x) and decreased albumin to globulin ratio (0.85 to 
0.91x) in females, decreased phosphorus (0.87 to 0.89x) in females, increased urine total protein 
concentration (1.81 to 2.71x) and urine total protein excretion (1.80 to 2.48x) in males, increased 
absolute and relative (to body and brain) liver weights (34% to 47%) with minimal to mild centrilobular 
hypertrophy in both sexes (2/10 males and 4/10 females), increased absolute and relative thyroid 
weights (9% to 16%) in females with a microscopic correlate of minimal follicular cell hypertrophy.  
Changes in the liver and thyroid were consistent with hepatic induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes and 
an increased clearance of thyroid hormones, and were seen in previous rat studies with COBI. 
The Applicant stated that additional non-adverse findings included increased platelets (1.32x control) in 
males and increased fibrinogen (1.26x) in females with COBI-NS; and decreased mean red cell volume 
(0.96x) with corresponding decreased mean cell haemoglobin (0.96x) and increased red cell distribution 
width (1.05x) in females with COBI-SP.  
All COBI-NS or COBI-SP-related changes were considered non-adverse as they were generally minimal in 
severity and showed a low incidence.  
In Week 13, COBI AUC (0-T) at 30 mg/kg/day of COBI-NS or COBI-SP were lower in males (0.3x) than in 
females. After repeat dosing, COBI AUC values were 1.4 to 3.1x those on Day 1, indicating slight to 
moderate accumulation. Overall, as spiked impurities had no impact on mean COBI AUC values, Week 13 
AUC values were generally similar to those previously observed in rats following 3 months of COBI dosing 
at 30 mg/kg/day as a single agent.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Atazanavir 
The Phase I PECsurfacewater of atazanavir was calculated according the EMA guideline formula. It exceeds 
the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. A standard Phase II fate and effects assessment was performed by the 
applicant. 
The studies reported comprised: a soil adsorption coefficient, a ready biodegradability test, a 
water/sediment study, chronic toxicity studies in aquatic organisms and an activated sludge respiration 
test.  
The adsorption coefficient test resulted in a Koc≤10 000 L/Kg indicating that the adsorption potential is 
low. Atazanavir was not readily biodegradable and the reported results of the water / sediment study 
demonstrated that the substance shifts from the water phase to the sediment phase. Therefore, a further 
assessment of the sediment phase has been made in Phase II B with a chronic sediment toxicity study 
(chironomid test). 
EMA/517796/2015  
Page 24/98 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The Aerobic Transformation in Aquatic Sediment systems study has shown that atazanavir has the 
potential to be persistent in the environment. 
PNECsurfacewater was based on the lowest NOEC determined in the algae reported study. The 
PNECmicroorganisms   was based on the NOEC from the sludge respiration inhibition test and the PNEC 
groundwater based on the NOEC from the Daphnia chronic growth / reproduction test. 
A refined PECsurfacewater was performed by the applicant based on prevalence of HIV-1 in Estonia. The 
calculated value was 2.6 µg/L. The threshold value was once more exceeded. A risk assessment was 
recalculated for the environmental compartments. 
No risk has been identified for the surfacewater, groundwater, wastewater treatment plant and sediment 
compartments as the PEC/PNEC ratios were below the threshold values.

Cobicistat 
The Phase I PECsurfacewater of cobicistat (0.75µg/L) was calculated according the EMA guideline formula. It 
exceeds the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. A standard Phase II fate and effects assessment was performed by 
the applicant. 
The studies reported comprised: a soil adsorption coefficient study, a ready biodegradability test, a 
water/sediment study, toxicity studies in aquatic organisms and an activated sludge respiration test.  
The adsorption coefficient test resulted in a Koc≤10 000 L/Kg indicating that the adsorption potential is 
low. Cobicistat was not readily biodegradable and the reported results of the water / sediment study 
demonstrated that the substance shifts significantly from the water phase to the sediment phase.  
The Aerobic Transformation in Aquatic Sediment systems study has shown that cobicistat has the 
potential to be persistent in the environment.

 PNECsurfacewater was based on the lowest NOEC determined in the early life-stage study for fish (the 
most sensitive aquatic organism). The PNECmicroorganisms   was based on the NOEC from the sludge 
respiration inhibition test and the PNEC groundwater based on the NOEC from the Daphnia chronic 
reproduction test. 
A refined PECsurfacewater was performed by the applicant based on prevalence of HIV-1 in Estonia. The 
calculated value was 0.975 µg/L, the threshold value was once more exceeded. A risk assessment was 
calculated for the environmental compartments. 
No risk has been identified for the surfacewater, groundwater, wastewater treatment plant as the 
PEC/PNEC values were below the threshold values. However, the risk to the sediment compartment has 
not yet been investigated but the sediment dwelling organism study is planned for submission in the 
post-approval phase.

In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following point for further investigation: 
• The applicant committed to submit an updated environmental risk assessment which clarifies the effects 
of COBI on sediment dwelling organisms. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In an ex vivo Langendorff, isolated rabbit heart pharmacology study ATV and COBI exhibited effects on LV 
contractility and PR prolongation. When ATV + COBI were tested in combination, no clear additive or 
synergistic cardiovascular effects were observed. 
A 3-month oral combination toxicity study in rats (GS Study TX-216-2024) in which ATV and COBI were 
given daily, either alone or in combination was conducted. ATV/COBI was given at 0/0 (vehicle), 20/30, 
or 50/30 mg/kg/day to both sexes. ATV and COBI were administered alone at 20 or 50 mg/kg/day and 30 
mg/kg/day, respectively. All doses were administered at 2 mL/kg. No new or unexpected toxicities were 
noted this study. A 3-month oral qualifying toxicity study in rat was conducted to compare the toxicity of 
a COBI-spiked batch (COBI-SP) with the toxicity profile of COBI not spiked (COBI-NS) with degradants. 
This study showed that 4 potential COBI degradants did not alter the toxicological or toxicokinetic profile 
of COBI. 
No other nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic or safety assessment studies have been conducted 
with the ATV/COBI FDC tablet, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.  Based on the nonclinical 
data presented of the individual agents, there appears to be no significant potential for adverse 
pharmacodynamic interactions between the two components. Pharmacokinetic interaction between ATV 
and COBI is also not expected and both ATV and COBI have in general low propensity for clinically 
significant pharmacokinetic interactions with other co-administered drugs.  
EMA/517796/2015  
Page 28/98 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
An extensive number of nonclinical toxicity studies, previously conducted for each of the agents 
individually to support their respective original marketing applications. No significant toxicological finding 
was identified for either compound that would indicate a concern for ATV and COBI co-administration. 
The applicant has conducted a full environmental risk assessment. The water-sediment-study (OECD 
308) clearly shows that both active ingredients atazanavir and cobicistat are persistent in the total 
water-sediment system; with %shifting to sediment and DT50 exceeding the trigger value for 
“persistence”. In addition, the CHMP note that the dataset are incomplete: As sediment shifting of the 
drug substance was demonstrated (sediment shifting > 10%), the CHMP recommended the Applicant to 
investigate the effects of cobicistat on sediment organisms and the data will be submitted 
post-authorisation. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There are no objections against the registration of the fixed dose combination of atazanvir and cobicistat 
from a non-clinical point of view.  However, the applicant further committed to submit an updated 
environmental risk assessment which clarifies the effects of COBI on sediment dwelling organisms. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The clinical pharmacology program for Atazanavir (ATV)/Cobicistat (COBI) FDC is based principally on 
demonstrating bioequivalence of ATV in ATV/COBI FDC compared to ATV capsule coadministered with a 
COBI tablet and PK bridging of ATV co-administered with COBI with ATV co-administered with low-dose 
ritonavir (rtv). 
Bioavailability 
The absolute bioavailability of the ATV/COBI FDC has not been investigated. The relative bioavailability of 
COBI  and ATV when administered as part of a FDC tablet of ATV/COBI 300/150 mg were considered by 
the applicant to be similar to COBI/ATV administered as individual components under fasted conditions 
(see results of the bioequivalence Study AI424511). In addition; a Phase 1 randomised, open-label, 
single-centre, multiple-dose, 6-sequence, 3-period crossover study GS-US-216-0110 was conducted to 
evaluate the relative bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of Atazanavir co-administered with Cobicistat 
compared with Ritonavir. 
The treatment groups were as follows: 
EMA/517796/2015  
Page 29/98 
 
 
  
 
 
• 
• 
• 
Treatment A: ATV 300 mg (1 × 300-mg capsule) + COBI (GS-9350)100 mg (1 × 100-mg tablet), 
coadministered orally QD in the morning for 10 consecutive days (ATV+COBI 300/100 mg) 
Treatment B: ATV 300 mg (1 × 300-mg capsule) + COBI 150 mg (1 × 150-mg tablet), 
coadministered orally QD in the morning for 10 consecutive days (ATV+COBI 300/150 mg) 
Treatment C: ATV 300 mg (1 × 300-mg capsule) + RTV 100 mg (1 × 100-mg capsule), 
coadministered orally QD in the morning for 10 consecutive days (ATV+RTV 300/100 mg). 
A total of 42 healthy adult subjects were randomized and treated with study drug. A total of 33 subjects 
completed all study treatments; 9 subjects discontinued prematurely. Enrolled subjects were 
predominantly white (67%) and male (67%), with a mean age of 28 years (range: 18 to 45 years). Mean 
weight was 75.0 kg, mean height was 172 cm, mean body mass index was 25.3 kg/m2 (range: 20.3 to 
30.6 kg/m2), and mean estimated creatine clearance was 127 mL/min. 
Results  
Atazanavir/COBI 300/150 mg and atazanavir/rtv 300/100 mg were found to be bioequivalent with 
regards to AUCtau, Cmax, and Ctau. In addition, atazanavir Tmax and T1/2 were comparable between these 
two treatments. Exposure of Atazanavir was lower with Atazanavir/COBI 300/100 mg dosing when 
compared with atazanavir/r 300/100 mg and there was a shorter T1/2. Greater than dose-proportional 
increases in COBI exposures were observed at 150 mg relative to 100 mg (each when co-administered 
with atazanavir). 
Study conclusions 
The present study demonstrated that atazanavir exposures (AUCtau, Cmax, and Ctau) were bioequivalent 
following administration of atazanavir + GS-9350 300+150 mg versus atazanavir + ritonavir 300+100 
mg. Furthermore, atazanavir t max and t 1/2 were comparable between these two treatments. 
Safety conclusions 
With regard to safety and tolerability, results do not elicit new safety concerns with regard to both 
atazanavir and cobicistat, as there were no unexpected findings. 
EMA/517796/2015

Bioequivalence 
The relative bioavailability and PK of atazanavir when coadministered with cobicistat vs. coadministration 
with ritonavir (RTV) was assessed in study GS-US-216-0110. For the purpose of the ATV/COBI FDC 
application, only ATV pharmacokinetics/bioequivalence was assessed. Cobicistat and ritonavir PK results 
were considered as additional supportive information. 
The relative bioavailability and PK of ATV in a FDC of ATV/COBI (300/150 mg) as compared to a 300 mg 
ATV capsule co-administered with a 150 mg COBI tablet when administered with a light meal was 
assessed in study AI424511. 
Study AI424511 
Study AI424511 was an open-label, single-dose, 5-period, 5-treatment, randomized crossover study in 
healthy subjects. Approximately 64 subjects were equally randomized to one of eight treatment 
sequences (ABCDE, ABDCE, BACDE, BADCE, ABCD, ABDC, BACD or BADC). Between period 1 and period 
5, study was designed with a total duration of 31 days, according to the Figure 1: 
Figure 1.  Study scheme 
a Approximately 64 subjects will be randomized prior to Day 1 dosing 
b Approximately 32 subjects will be discharged at the end of Period 4 (Day 24) based on the assigned treatment sequence

d Screening and Enrollment 
Treatments 
Treatment A: atazanavir 300 mg (Capsule) + 150 mg cobicistat (Tablet) co-administered following a light 
meal 
Treatment B: atazanavir 300 mg/150 mg cobicistat - Fixed Dose Combination (Tablet) administered 
following a light meal  
Treatment C: atazanavir 300 mg (Capsule) + 150 mg cobicistat (Tablet) co-administered under fasted

under fasted condition 
Treatment E: atazanavir 300 mg/150 mg cobicistat - Fixed Dose Combination (Tablet) administered with 
a high fat meal 
Subjects received Treatments A or B (following a light meal) according to the assigned treatment 
sequences on Day 1 and Day 8. On Day 15 and Day 22, subjects received Treatment C or D under fasted 
conditions according to the assigned treatment sequences. On Day 29, approximately half of the subjects, 
according to the assigned sequence, received Treatment E (following a high fat meal). Between all 
treatment periods there was a 7-day washout period.

Population 
One hundred and forty nine (149) subjects were screened. From these, 64 subjects were enrolled and 
treated and 62 subjects completed all study treatments. Two subjects discontinued prior study 
completion. 
Results 
The results demonstrated that Atazanavir administered as a FDC tablet of ATV/COBI 300/150 mg is 
bioequivalent to ATV administered as an individual component, when given with a light meal. The 90% 
confidence intervals (CIs) of the model-based geometric mean ratios of ATV Cmax, area under the 
concentration-time curve from time zero to time of the last quantifiable concentration [AUC (0-T)], and 
area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinite time [AUC (INF)] for the FDC versus 
co-administration of the individual component were completely contained within the (0.80, 1.25) range 
that was pre-specified to conclude bioequivalence. 
Atazanavir 
The bioavailability of ATV administered as a FDC tablet of ATV/COBI 300/150 mg (Treatment D) was 
similar to ATV + COBI administered as individual components when given under fasted conditions. The 
90% CI of the ratios for AUC (0-T) and AUC (INF) were completely contained within the (0.80, 1.25) range. 
However, the upper range of the 90% CI for Cmax and C24 for ATV were higher than 1.25 (1.292 and 
1.3000 respectively.

Cobicistat 
COBI administered as part of a FDC tablet of ATV/COBI 300/150 mg (Treatment B) was demonstrated to 
be bioequivalent to COBI administered as an individual component when given with a light meal. The 
geometric mean ratios of C max, AUC(INF) and AUC(0- T) for COBI were close to 1.00 and the 90% CI of the 
ratios were completely contained within the (0.80, 1.25) bioequivalence range. 
Table 6.  Results of the Statistical Analyses of Cobicistat Following Administration of the FDC and 
Coadministration of the Individual Components with a Light Meal 
The relative bioavailability of COBI administered as a FDC tablet of ATV/COBI 300/150 mg (Treatment D) 
was similar to COBI administered as an individual component under fasted conditions but the upper 
bound of the 90% CI for C max and AUC (0-T) were 1.273 and 1.307, respectively. The 90% CI of the ratio 
of AUC (INF was contained within the (0.80, 1.25) bioequivalence range.

Influence of food 
Effect of food on Atazanavir 
When the FDC tablet of ATV/COBI 300/150 mg was administered with a light meal compared to under 
fasted conditions, the AUCs of ATV were increased by approximately 28% and Cmax was increased by 
42%; in addition, C24 was increased by 35%. However, the AUCs of ATV with high fat meal were not 
significantly affected compared to fasted conditions, but Cmax decreased by 14% while C24 increased by 
23%. Cmax and AUCs after a high fat meal decreased 36% and 25% in comparison to a light meal 
respectively. However, ATV C24 was similar when FDC was administered with either a light meal or a high 
fat meal.

Effect of food on Cobicistat 
When a FDC tablet of ATV/COBI 300/150 mg was administered with a light meal, the AUCs of COBI were 
increased by approximately 24% and Cmax was increased 30%, compared to fasted conditions. However, 
the exposures of COBI when administered as the FDC with a high fat meal showed no significant 
difference vs. the fasted condition (Treatment D); the 90% CIs of the geometric mean ratio for COBI 
Cmax, AUC(0-T) and AUC(INF) were all contained within the 0.80-1.25 range. When comparing the FDC 
administered with the high fat meal (Treatment E) vs. a light meal (Treatment B), a 10% decrease of 
AUCs and 22% decrease in Cmax were observed.

Treatment: A = ATV 300mg cap+150mg COBI tab light meal, B = ATV 300mg/150mg COBI-FDC tab light meal, C = ATV 300mg

E = ATV 300mg/150mg COBI-FDC tab high fat meal 
Distribution 
It is expected that the distribution of the FDC tablet would be the same as after administration of the 
single components of ATV and COBI.   
Cobicistat 
The plasma protein binding of COBI in nonclinical species ranged from 90.9% to 97.7%, and was 97.3% 
in healthy human subjects this occurred in a concentration-independent manner.After an oral 150-mg 
dose of [14C]COBI in healthy subjects(based on equilibrium dialysis studies). 
The blood-to-plasma ratio of 14C-radioactivity was time-independent and ~ 0.5, indicating that COBI and 
its metabolites are excluded from the cellular components of the blood.  
The distribution of COBI into compartments other than plasma (eg, cerebrospinal fluid or genital tract 
secretions) was not clinically evaluated. 
Atazanavir 
EMA/517796/2015  
Page 35/98 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Atazanavir is approximately 86% bound to human serum proteins over a concentration range of 100 to 
10,000 ng/ml. Atazanavir binds to both alpha 1 acid glycoprotein (AAG) and albumin to a similar extent 
(89% and 86%, respectively, at 1,000 ng/ml). 
Elimination 
It is expected that the elimination pathway for the FDC tablet would be the same as after administration 
of the single components of ATV and COBI.   
Cobicistat 
The metabolism of COBI is mediated primarily via oxidative processes. Cobicistat is primarily metabolized 
via CYP3A- and/or CYP2D6-mediated oxidation, with no evidence of Phase 2 metabolism. The total 
combined mean (SD) recovery of 14C-radioactivity in faeces and urine was 94.4% (3.75%), with most of 
the radioactive dose recovered from the faeces (86.2% [3.95%]), consistent with the hepatobiliary 
excretion of COBI and primarily as parent drug or metabolites M21 (GS-9454, or E1) or M31 (GS-9612, 
or E3); 8.2% of the administered dose was recovered in urine, primarily as unchanged parent drug and 
with low levels of metabolites M21 and M31. The predominant species circulating in plasma was COBI, 
which accounted for 98.6% of the total 14C-radioactivity over 24 hours. Analysis by HPLC radiometry and 
LC/MS/MS showed that COBI was the major species in the faeces (27%), followed by known oxidative 
metabolites, E3 (14%), which results from hydroxylation of isopropyl thiazole; and E1 (5.5%), which 
results from carbamate cleavage. 
All other metabolites detected in the feces were in trace amounts, with no values exceeding 3% of the 
administered radioactive dose.  
Renal excretion of COBI was a minor pathway for elimination. In urine samples pooled for individual 
subjects by collection interval and analyzed by HPLC, a mean (SD) of 6.31% (1.15%) of the total 
radioactive dose was quantified and was comprised primarily of COBI. Known metabolites E1 (M21, 
GS-9454, GS-342006) and E3 (M31, GS-9612, GS-364751) were present in very low amounts (ie, < 10% 
of the administered dose was present in urine as parent drug plus metabolites). 
Atazanavir 
Studies in humans and in vitro studies using human liver microsomes have demonstrated that atazanavir 
is principally metabolised by CYP3A4 isozyme to oxygenated metabolites. Metabolites are then excreted 
in the bile as either free or glucuronidated metabolites. Additional minor metabolic pathways consist of N 
dealkylation and hydrolysis. Two minor metabolites of atazanavir in plasma have been characterised. 
Following a single 400 mg dose of [14C]atazanavir, 79% and 13% of the total radioactivity was recovered 
in the faeces and urine, respectively. Unchanged drug accounted for approximately 20% and 7% of the 
administered dose in the faeces and urine, respectively. Mean urinary excretion of unchanged drug was 
7% following 2 weeks of dosing at 800 mg once daily. 
Dose proportionality 
There is no discussion by the applicant regarding the dose proportionality of ATV alone or in combination 
with Cobi. It is noted from study GS-US-216-0110 that COBI exhibits non-linear increases in systemic 
exposure following and multiple-dose administration. 
EMA/517796/2015  
Page 36/98 
 
 
  
 
 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Not discussed by the applicant however regarding inter-individual variability it does appear that CV% 
values are considerable for COBI after single and multiple dosing. In addition, in HIV-infected subjects the 
ATV CV% values were higher in the Phase 3 study GS-US-216-0114  (~50% for AUCtau and 40-50% for 
Cmax) than in the Phase 2 study GS-US-216-0105. When ATV was boosted with COBI the CV% was 
comparable with that for ATV boosted with RTV in the Phase 3 study but lower with COBI than with RTV 
boosting in the Phase 2 study.  However, the CV% for COBI Cmax and AUC were lower in the Phase 3 study 
than in the Phase 2 study. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Pharmacokinetic sub-studies analyses were conducted as part of two efficacy studies in HIV-1-infected 
subjects (GS-US-216-0105 and GS-US-216-0114). 
Study GS-US-216-0105

compared to RTV-boosted ATV in combination with emtricitabine [FTC]/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
[TDF] in HIV-1-infected, ARV treatment-naive adults in which a PK sub-study was performed at the 
Weeks 2, 4, or 8 visits in a subset of subjects in both treatment groups. The results are shown in Tables 
10 and Table 11.

treatment groups. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for COBI, ATV, FTC, RTV, and TDF. 
The PK sub-study analysis data set, comprising all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of 
study drug, participated in the PK sub-study, and for whom steady-state PK parameters of study drug 
analytes at the Weeks 2, 4, or 8 visits were calculable, was the primary analysis data set for the detailed 
PK analyses of COBI, ATV, FTC, RTV, and TDF.

Impaired renal function 
No studies have been conducted with the ATV/COBI FDC in patients with impaired renal function. 
However, both ATV and COBI as single components have been assessed in this population. Excretion by 
the kidney is a minor pathway of elimination for ATV and COBI with approximately 7% of administered 
ATV is eliminated renally and 8% of the administered dose of COBI is excreted in the urine. 
Apparently in study AI424105, administration of ATV 400 mg QD in patients with severe renal impairment 
not undergoing haemodialysis resulted in ATV Cmax, AUC, and Cmin that were 9% lower, 19% higher, and 
96% higher than in subjects with normal renal function who were matched in age, weight, and gender. 
However, when ATV was administered either prior to or immediately following haemodialysis, ATV Cmax, 
AUC, and Cmin were reduced 25% to 43% relative to subjects with normal renal function. 
Apparently in subjects with severe renal impairment administered COBI, no clinically relevant impact on 
COBI systemic exposures was observed relative to subjects with normal renal function. 
Impaired hepatic function 
No studies have been conducted with the ATV/COBI FDC in patients with impaired hepatic function. 
Apparently in study AI424015, following administration of a single oral dose of ATV 400 mg to subjects 
with Child-Pugh class B hepatic impairment (N=12) or Child-Pugh class C hepatic impairment (N=2), ATV 
AUC(INF) was 42% higher and the T1/2 of ATV was nearly 2-fold greater than that observed in subjects with 
normal hepatic function. 
For COBI, relative to subjects with normal hepatic function, subjects with Child-Pugh class B hepatic 
impairment administered COBI did not display a clinically relevant change in COBI systemic exposures. 
Interactions 
No drug-interaction studies have been specifically conducted with the ATV/COBI FDC tablet or using ATV 
co-administered with COBI as separate agents. The drug interaction potential of ATV/COBI FDC has been 
evaluated on the basis of interactions observed with each of the single agents, the known impact of 
ATV/COBI on CYP enzymes and PK drug-interaction studies conducted with the individual components of 
the FDC (ATV/COBI) and the drug interaction potential of ATV when co-administered with rtv. This was 
considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Both ATV and COBI are metabolised by CYP3A4 and COBI is also metabolised by CYP2D6 to a lesser 
extent. Atazanavir is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and UGT1A1 and a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8.  
Cobicistat is a strong mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A. It is also an inhibitor of CYP2D6, as well as the 
transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP), multidrug and toxin extrusion 
transporter (MATE1), organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1, and OATP1B3.  However, COBI 
is not an inducer of CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or UGT1A1. 
Plasma concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates are expected to increase when coadministered with the 
ATV/COBI FDC. This is anticipated to be primarily driven by CYP3A4 inhibition by COBI; however, ATV is 
also an inhibitor of CYP3A4, and could be a contributor to overall CYP3A4 inhibition by the FDC, resulting 
in increased plasma concentrations of coadministered CYP3A4 substrates.  
The inhibition of CYP2C8 by ATV is expected to result in increased plasma concentrations of CYP2C8 
substrates if coadministered with the ATV/COBI FDC. Likewise, the inhibition of UGT1A1 by ATV is 
expected to increase plasma concentrations of UGT1A1 substrates if coadministered with the ATV/COBI 
FDC.  
EMA/517796/2015  
Page 39/98 
 
 
  
 
 
Co-administration of the ATV/COBI FDC with drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6, BCRP, MATE1, 
OATP1B1, and/or OATP1B3 could possibly increase plasma concentrations of those substrates due to 
inhibition of CYP2D6 and those transporters by COBI. Unlike RTV, COBI is not an inducer of CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or UGT1A1. Therefore in some cases, extrapolation of drug 
interactions observed with ATV/RTV is anticipated to be different with the ATV/COBI FDC. Where data are 
available, drug interaction information with unboosted ATV (i.e., ATV without RTV) was taken into 
consideration when predicting the direction of impact on plasma concentrations of the coadministered 
drug when given with the ATV/COBI FDC, without the confounding effect of RTV. 
A table summarising the theoretical drug-drug interactions for the ATV/COBI FDC as well as more detailed 
information on the background and extrapolation of drug-drug interactions is presented below.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Atazanavir 
Reyataz, atazanavir (ATV) is a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor. It is an 
azapeptide that blocks the processing of viral gag-pol proteins in HIV-1 infected cells, thus preventing 
formation of mature virions. 
Cobicistat 
Tybost, cobicistat, COBI has been shown to inhibit the activity of human CYP3A enzymes (IC50 values 
0.03 to 0.15 μM) and enzyme kinetic studies have demonstrated that it is an efficient inactivator of human 
CYP3A activity. The potency of the observed inhibition and inactivation was comparable to that observed 
with RTV and hence, the applicant has identified COBI as a mechanism-based inhibitor. The Applicant has 
provided evidence that the inhibition of CYP3A is time, NADPH and concentration dependent, which 
suggests that cobicistat is capable of mechanism-based inhibition. However, the Applicant states that the 
precise molecular mechanism of inhibition is not completely understood and that overall, the mechanism 
may be mixed.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The applicant has not conducted a comprehensive investigation of the PK of ATV/COBI and relies on 
demonstrating bioequivalence of ATV in ATV/COBI FDC compared to ATV capsule coadministered with a 
COBI tablet. In addition PK data bridging ATV co-administered with COBI with ATV co-administered with 
low-dose ritonavir (RTV) is provided. This approach is considered acceptable in principle as the 
pharmacokinetics of the single agents have previously been characterised.  
The results of the study (AI424511) demonstrated that ATV and COBI contained in the FDC are 
bioequivalent to the individual components following a light meal therefore the primary objective of the 
study was fulfilled. In the fasted state however, Cmax and C24 for ATV and the AUC(0-t) and Cmax for 
COBI contained in the FDC were found to be increased as compared to the individual component and were 
not bioequivalent. In addition, there was a decrease in ATV and COBI Cmax, exposure (AUCs) and delay 
in Tmax following a high fat meal in comparison to a light meal. Differences on PK behaviour between light 
fat and high fat meals are not totally understood, but might be due to solubility and gastric emptying 
issues. Moreover, the obtained results are in accordance with Reyataz SmPC (ATV) and in accordance 
with cobicistat pharmacokinetic properties described on Stribild SmPC (Gilead), as a four-drug 
(elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir), fixed-dose combination drug product developed by 
Gilead for HIV treatment. Nevertheless, it was requested that differences be clearly stated in section 5.2 
of the SmPC.  
PK sub-studies were also conducted as part of the efficacy studies (GS-US-216-0114 and 
GS-US-216-0105). The results of study GS-US-216-0105 showed that the plasma concentrations of ATV 
were slightly lower on boosting with COBI when compared with RTV. The trough concentration levels were 
higher with ATV boosted with COBI as compared with RTV and in study GS-US-216-0114 the results 
showed that FTC and TFV plasma concentration levels were higher with COBI however ATV plasma levels 
were lower on co-administration with COBI. In addition, the CV% values are quite high in both studies, 
especially for Cmax and AUC of ATV when given with either COBI or RTV, which was concluded by the 
applicant to be of no clinically relevance. 
No drug-drug interaction studies have been performed using ATV/COBI FDC tablet formulations or ATV 
co-administered with COBI as separate agents and the applicant bases the drug interaction potential on 
the interactions observed with each single agent which is considered adequate. The pharmacodynamic 
section has been completely omitted as the applicant considers that the ATV and COBI have previously 
been characterised in procedures EMEA/H/C/000494 (ATV) and EMEA/H/C/002572 (COBI). This has been 
accepted and the lack of information will not be pursued further. 
Overall, there are no major concerns regarding the PK of this FDC and all points for clarification have been 
resolved. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The applicant has not conducted a comprehensive investigation of the PK of ATV/COBI and relies on 
demonstrating bioequivalence of ATV in ATV/COBI FDC compared to ATV capsule coadministered with a 
COBI tablet. In addition PK data bridging ATV co-administered with COBI with ATV co-administered with 
low-dose ritonavir (RTV) is provided. This approach is considered acceptable as the pharmacokinetics of 
the single agents have previously been characterised.  
Overall, there are no major concerns regarding the PK of this FDC and all points for clarification have been 
resolved.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies and main clinical studies 
No dose response study was conducted. The clinical programme of ATV/COBI is primarily based on a 
pharmacokinetic bridging clinical programme based on demonstrating the bioequivalence of ATV when 
co-administered with COBI either as the FDC (formulation G006) or the single agents under fed 
conditions. Two studies have been conducted in which ATV and COBI were administered as part of the 
regimen; GS-US-216-0105 and GS-US-216-0114. 
Study GS-US-216-0114 
Title of Study: A Phase 3, randomised, double-blind study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
GS-9350 (COBI)-boosted Atazanavir compared with ritonavir-boosted Atazanavir administered with 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate in HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral treatment-naive adults 
Study participants  
During the randomized, blinded phase of the study through Week 48, continuing to Week 96, the 
following study drugs were administered orally, once daily, with food, at approximately the same time 
each day: 
Treatment Group 1: 
COBI (1 x 150-mg tablet) + ATV (1 x 300-mg capsule) + TVD (FTC/TDF 200/300 mg; 1 x tablet) + RTV 
placebo (1 x 100 mg tablet) 
Treatment Group 2: 
RTV (1 x 100-mg tablet) + ATV (1 x 300-mg capsule) + TVD (FTC/TDF 200/300 mg; 1 x tablet) + COBI 
placebo (1 x 150-mg tablet) 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was  to  evaluate the efficacy of a regimen containing ATV/co versus 
ATV/r, each administered with TVD, in HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral treatment-naive adult subjects as 
determined by the achievement of HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) < 50 copies/mL at Week 48 . The primary 
efficacy endpoint was evaluated in the Week 48 interim analysis and evaluated in the Weeks 96 and 144 
interim analyses. 
The secondary objective of this study (evaluated beyond Week 48) was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, 
and tolerability of the 2 treatment regimens through 192 weeks of treatment 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 48 
as defined by the FDA snapshot analysis algorithm. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints were as follows: 
• 
• 
The percentage of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 192, as defined by the 
snapshot algorithm 
The achievement and maintenance of confirmed HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL through Weeks 48 
and 192, as defined by the time to loss of virologic response (TLOVR) algorithm  
Sample size 
EMA/517796/2015  
Page 58/98 
 
 
  
 
 
A total sample size of 700 HIV-1 infected subjects randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 2 treatment groups (350 
subjects per group) was considered to have at least 95% power to establish non-inferiority with respect 
to the response rate of HIV-1 < 50 copies/mL at Week 48 between the 2 treatment groups, as defined by 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) snapshot analysis. For sample size and power computations it 
was assumed that both treatment groups would have a response rate of 0.795 (based on Gilead Study 
GS-01-934), that the non-inferiority margin was 0.12, and that the significance level of the test was at a 
1-sided, 0.025 level. Calculations were made using the software package Query Advisor, Version 6.0. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Treatment Group 1 or Treatment Group 2. Randomization was 
stratified by HIV-1 RNA level (≤ 100,000 copies/mL or > 100,000 copies/mL) at screening. 
Blinding (masking) 
The IVRS/IWRS assigned blinded study drug bottle numbers at each study visit (except Week 2). Study 
drug (COBI/RTV and matching placebos) was dispensed to subjects in a blinded fashion. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis populations for efficacy analyses were defined as follows: 
Randomised Analysis Set 
Included all randomised subjects (as statistical analysis plan).  
Intent-to-Treat Analysis Set 
For efficacy analyses using the ITT analysis set subjects were grouped by randomised treatment. The ITT 
analysis set included all randomised who received at least 1 dose of study drug. This was the primary 
analysis set for efficacy analyses.  
Per Protocol Analysis Set 
For efficacy analyses using the per protocol (PP) analysis set subjects were grouped by actual treatment 
received. The PP analysis set included all randomised who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had 
no major protocol violation (including violation of major entry criteria). For the PP analysis set, efficacy 
data were summarised up to the last dose date of blinded study drug. The PP analysis set was the 
secondary analysis set for the primary endpoint. Subjects meeting any of the following criteria were 
excluded from the PP analysis set: 
Discontinued study drug prior to/on the upper bound of the Week 48 analysis window due to reasons 
other than lack of efficacy and the assessments of HIV-1 RNA on randomised treatment were not available 
in the Week 48 analysis window. Lack of efficacy was defined as having the check-box for “Lack of 
Efficacy” marked as the reason for study drug discontinuation on the study drug completion electronic 
Case Report Form (eCRF) page. 
•  Did not discontinue study drug prior to/on the upper bound of the Week 48 analysis window but 
assessments of HIV-1 RNA on randomised treatment were not available in the Week 48 analysis 
window 
•  Did not have documented sensitivity to FTC, TDF and ATV in a screening genotype report 
EMA/517796/2015  
Page 59/98 
 
 
  
 
 
•  Received ongoing therapy with any of the forbidden medications  
•  Had an adherence rate for active study drug below the 2.5th percentile 
• 
• 
Took antiretroviral medication other than randomised study drug consecutively for ≥ 4 weeks 
prior to the Week 48 HIV-1 RNA assessment 
Interrupted study drug for ≥ 4 consecutive weeks prior to the Week 48 HIV-1 RNA assessment 
•  Had missing HIV-1 RNA assessments in 3 consecutive scheduled visits prior to the Week 48 HIV-1 
RNA assessment 
Interim analyses 
The first interim analysis took place after the first 350 subjects either completed the Week 12 visit or 
prematurely discontinued study drugs. 
The Week 24 IDMC analysis was conducted after the last subject either completed the Week 24 visit or 
prematurely discontinued study drugs. 
Primary Analysis 
The currently reported Week 48 interim analysis was conducted after all randomised subjects either 
completed their Week 48 study visit or prematurely discontinued study drugs before their Week 48 visit. 
The last subject completed the Week 48 visit on 31 October 2011. The database was finalised on 01 
December 2011 and included all data through Week 48 and available data collected after the Week 48 
visit. The Week 48 analysis data cut included all eCRF data collected up to 31 October 2011 and all 
laboratory, virology and PK data through 01 December 2011. Further interim analyses were provided 
during the evaluation and are presented later in this section. 
The non-inferiority evaluation of proportions that achieved HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 48 
(FDA-defined snapshot approach) was the pre-specified primary comparison.  
In light of the interim IDMC analyses at Weeks 12 and 24, the alpha level for the Week 48 analysis was 
adjusted to 0.048. The sponsor did not have a prior intent to ask the IDMC to consider early termination 
of the study even if there was early evidence of favourable efficacy. Since there was no intent to stop the 
study early, the Haybittle procedure was used as a stopping rule.  
An alpha penalty of 0.001 was applied for each interim analysis performed by the IDMC. Therefore, for the 
primary endpoint analysis, a 95.2% CI (corresponding to an alpha level of 0.048) was constructed to 
preserve the overall alpha level of 0.05. As such, the primary analysis CI is described as a 95% CI. 
A Week 48 it was intended that the IDMC analysis would be performed at the same time as the primary 
efficacy endpoint was analysed and on this basis no alpha penalty was applied as the same data were 
used for this and for the primary analysis. 
Snapshot Analysis Algorithm 
In the snapshot analysis for the Week 48 virological outcome, the analysis window was defined from Days 
309 to 378 inclusive. All the HIV-1 RNA data collected on treatment (prior to or on the last dose date of 
study drug) were used in the snapshot analysis. Virological outcome was defined as: 
Virological Success: last available HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL in the Week 48 analysis window 
Virological Failure: last available HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL in the Week 48 analysis window OR did not 
have on-treatment HIV-1 RNA data in the Week 48 analysis window due to either of: 
EMA/517796/2015  
Page 60/98 
 
 
  
 
 
 
1) discontinuation of study drug for lack of efficacy 
2) discontinuation of study drug for reasons other than an AE, death or lack of efficacy AND last available 
HIV-1 RNA value on treatment was ≥ 50 copies/mL 
No Virological Data in the Week 48 analysis window: no on-treatment HIV-1 RNA data in the Week 48 
analysis window because:  
1) study drug was discontinued due to AE or death (regardless of last available HIV-1 RNA) 
2) study drug was discontinued due to reasons other than AE/death and lack of efficacy and the last 
available HIV-1 RNA value on treatment was < 50 copies/mL 
3) missing data during the window but remained on study drug 
The baseline HIV-1 RNA stratum (≤ 100,000 copies/mL or > 100,000 copies/mL)-weighted difference in 
the response rate (P1 – P2) and its 95% CI were calculated based on stratum-adjusted Mantel-Haenszel 
(MH) proportion.  
Non-inferiority margin 
It was concluded that ATV/COBI + TVD was non-inferior to the comparative regimen if the lower bound of 
the 2-sided 95% CI of the difference in the response rate (ATV/COBI – ATV/RTV group) was > −12%. If 
non-inferiority was established, the same 95% CI used to evaluate non-inferiority was used to evaluate 
superiority using the ITT analysis set. The superiority of ATV/COBI over comparator was established if the 
lower bound of the 95% CI was greater than 0. The baseline HIV-1 RNA stratum (≤ 100,000 copies/mL 
or > 100,000 copies/mL)-weighted, 2-sided CMH test was also used to assess superiority as a supportive 
analysis. 
Secondary and Sensitivity Analyses for the Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
A secondary analysis based on the PP analysis set was to evaluate the robustness of the primary analysis 
of the primary endpoint. Subjects excluded from the PP analysis set were determined before database 
lock. 
In addition, a series of sensitivity analyses were performed using the ITT analysis set to evaluate the 
robustness of the primary analysis of the primary endpoint: 
• 
For the first sensitivity analysis, subjects who had no HIV-1 RNA data in the Week 48 analysis 
window due to study drug discontinuation for reasons other than lack of efficacy, AEs or death and 
whose last available on-treatment HIV-1 RNA value was < 50 copies/mL were excluded from the 
numerator and denominator in the response rate computation. Additionally, for late 
discontinuation (i.e. discontinuation of study drug due to reasons other than death in the Week 48 
analysis window) all the HIV-1 RNA data in the Week 48 analysis window including data collected 
after the last dose of study drug were included in the evaluation of virological response per the 
FDA-defined snapshot algorithm. 
•  As a second sensitivity analysis, subjects who had no HIV-1 RNA data in the Week 48 analysis 
window due to study drug discontinuation for reasons other than lack of efficacy, AEs, or death 
and whose last available on-treatment HIV-1 RNA value was < 50 copies/mL were counted in the 
virological success category. HIV-1 RNA data collected after the last dose of study drug for late 
discontinuation were handled in the same way as in the first sensitivity analysis. 
• 
The last sensitivity analysis was to assess whether the treatment effect was confounded by region 
and baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA level. The following analyses were performed for the primary 
endpoint: (1) stratifying by region and (2) without any stratification factors. The results were 
EMA/517796/2015  
Page 61/98 
 
 
  
 
 
compared with the primary analysis (i.e. stratified by baseline HIV-1 RNA level). The stratified 
CMH analyses were used to estimate the odds ratio, the corresponding 95% CI and to obtain 
p-values. A region was defined as multiple sites combined based on sites from the neighbouring 
counties states in the US. 
TLOVR Algorithm 
The outcome variable for the achievement and maintenance of confirmed HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL 
through Week 48 (responder) was derived using all available HIV-1 RNA data (including unscheduled 
data, post-Week 48 data and 30-day follow-up data) based on the FDA-defined TLOVR algorithm.

Conduct of the study 
There were three protocol amendments after study initiation and four administrative letters were issued. 
These occurred before unblinding the week 48 dataset. Two of these amendments were specific to study 
sites in France and concerned: 
•  Details of the management of subjects with virological failure made in response to a request from the 
French Ethics Committee. These details were not applied to the original protocol outside France. 
• 
The first exclusion criterion was revised to clarify that subjects with an AIDS-defining diagnosis of a 
CD4-positive T lymphocyte count < 200/ìL or a CD4-positive T lymphocyte count < 14% of the total 
lymphocyte count were not excluded from participation in the study. 
The documentation does not provide details of the third amendment mentioned in the study report. 
Baseline data 
The majority of subjects in the safety analysis set were male (82.9%), with a mean age of 37 years 
(range, 19 to 70 years); most were white (59.7%) or black (18.5%), and non-Hispanic/Latino (71.8%). 
The mean value for BMI at baseline was 25.1 kg/m2. 
The mean (SD) baseline HIV-1 RNA value was 4.83 (0.589) log10 copies/mL, CD4 count was 352 (172.9) 
cells/ìL, and CD4% was 20.6% (8.57). Overall, 60.3% of subjects had baseline HIV-1 RNA ≤ 100,000 
copies/mL. The most common HIV risk factor category was homosexual sex (65.5% of subjects). The 
majority of subjects (83.4%) had asymptomatic HIV-1 infection, 9.1% of subjects had symptomatic 
HIV-1 infection, and 7.5% of subjects had been diagnosed with AIDS. A small percentage of subjects were 
HBsAg positive (3.6%) or HCV seropositive (5.3%). Overall, the mean (SD) baseline eGFR was 117.2 
(30.08) mL/min using the CG method, 102.4 (18.73) mL/min/1.73m2 using the MDRD method, and 
100.8 (21.11) mL/min/1.73m2 using the CysC method. There were no significant differences between 
treatment groups in baseline eGFR using CG, MDRD, or CysC methods. 
Numbers analysed 
Of the 698 subjects who were randomized, 692 were included in the safety and ITT analysis sets and 599 
were included in the PP analysis set. Of the 99 subjects excluded from the PP analysis set, 81 discontinued 
study drugs prior to the Week 48 analysis window for reasons other than lack of efficacy. Other reasons 
for exclusion from the PP analysis set are summarised in Table 15. 
A total of 48 subjects were included in the analysis set for the intensive PK sub-study (22 in the 
ATV/co+TVD group and 26 in the ATV/r+TVD group). 
There were 106 important protocol deviations in 88 subjects of which 73 had a single important deviation, 
12 had two and 3 subjects had 3 deviations. 
Protocol deviations were proportionally distributed between treatment groups and study centres and the 
majority were due to non-adherence (< 70% adherence at any visit based on pill count). Overall 24 
subjects violated a single eligibility criterion of which most were due to CD4 counts < 200 cells/ìL at the 
screening visit that were identified after treatment had commenced; these subjects did not have any 
other AIDS-defining condition and were not discontinued. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Virologic Outcome at Week 48 Using Snapshot Analysis and HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL 
Virologic outcomes at Week 48 were similar between the 2 treatment groups for the primary endpoint 
analysis in the ITT analysis set  
EMA/517796/2015  
Page 64/98 
 
 
  
 
 
At Week 48, 85.2% of subjects (293 of 344) in the ATV/co+TVD group and 87.4 % of subjects (304 of 
348) in the ATV/r+TVD group had virologic success (ITT analysis set). The difference in the percentages 
of subjects with virologic success was −2.2% (95% CI: −7.4% to 3.0%). Since the lower bound of the 
2-sided 95% CI of the baseline HIV-1 RNA stratum weighted difference in response rates (ATV/co+TVD – 
ATV/r+TVD) was greater than the pre-specified –12% non-inferiority margin, ATV/co+TVD was 
demonstrated to be non-inferior to ATV/co+TVD. 
At Week 48, 5.8% of subjects (20 of 344) in the ATV/co+TVD group and 4.0% of subjects (14 of 348) in 
the ATV/r+TVD group had virologic failure; 9.0% of subjects (31 of 344) in the ATV/co+TVD group and 
8.6% of subjects (30 of 348) in the ATV/r+TVD group had no virologic data in the Week 48 analysis 
window. Reasons for virologic failure and lack of virologic data in the Week 48 analysis window were 
balanced between the treatment groups.

Snapshot Analysis, ITT Analysis Set) 
a P-value for the superiority test comparing the percentages of virologic success was from the CMH test stratified by 
baseline HIV-1 RNA stratum. 
b Difference in percentages of virologic success and its 95.2% CI were calculated based on baseline HIV-1 RNA 
stratum-adjusted MH proportion. 
c Discontinuation due to other reasons includes subjects who discontinued study drug due to investigator's discretion, 
withdrew consent, lost to follow-up, subject noncompliance, protocol violation, and pregnancy. 
d Week 48 window is between Day 309 and 378 (inclusive). 
Non-inferiority was also demonstrated in the PP analysis set although actual success rates were higher. At 
Week 48, 98.0% of subjects (289 of 295) in the ATV/co+TVD group and 98.0% of subjects (298 of 304) 
in the ATV/r+TVD group had virologic success. The HIV-1 RNA stratum-weighted difference in the 
percentages of subjects with virologic success was −0.1% (95% CI: −2.5% to 2.3%)

Sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint demonstrated the following: 
•  After excluding study drug discontinuations not related to virologic response and included all HIV-1 
RNA data for late discontinuation (ITT analysis set). At Week 48, 87.5% of subjects (294 of 344) in 
the ATV/co+TVD group and 89.4% of subjects (305 of 348) in the ATV/r+TVD group had virologic 
success. The HIV-1 RNA stratum-weighted difference in the percentage of subjects with virologic 
success was −2.0% (95% CI: −6.9% to 2.8%). 
• 
Including study drug discontinuations not related to virologic response as virologic successes and 
included all HIV-1 RNA data for late discontinuation (ITT analysis set). At Week 48, 87.8% of subjects 
(302 of 344) in the ATV/co+TVD group and 89.7% of subjects (312 of 348) in the ATV/r+TVD group 
had virologic success. The difference in the percentages of subjects with virologic success was −1.9% 
(95% CI: −6.7% to 2.8%) 
•  After evaluating the impact of stratification factors (baseline HIV-1 RNA level and region) on the 
treatment effect at Week 48 (ITT analysis set) The baseline HIV-1 RNA level-adjusted odds ratio 
(ATV/co+TVD vs ATV/r+TVD) for achieving HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL was 0.83 (95% CI: 0.54 to 
1.28) and the region-adjusted odds ratio was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.52 to 1.26), both of which were similar 
to the unadjusted odds ratio of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.54 to 1.28) 
Achievement and Maintenance of HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL Through Week 48 
Virologic Outcome, TLOVR Analysis 
A total of 82.8% of subjects (285 of 344) in the ATV/co+TVD group and 85.3% of subjects (297 of 348) 
in the ATV/r+TVD group achieved and maintained confirmed HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL through Week 48 
and were considered responders. The HIV-1 RNA stratum-weighted difference in the percentage of 
responders at Week 48 was −2.6% (95% CI: −8.1% to 2.8%), indicating that ATV/co+TVD was 
non-inferior to ATV/r+TVD using the TLOVR algorithm.

Percentages of non-responders were similar between the 2 treatment groups . At Week 48, 3.5% of 
subjects (12 of 344) in the ATV/co+TVD group and 4.0% of subjects (14 of 348) in the ATV/r+TVD group 
had confirmed viral rebound or never achieved viral suppression through Week 48 and were considered 
non-responders. Similar percentages of subjects in each treatment group were considered 
non-responders due to death or study drug discontinuation. 
Time to Loss of Virologic Response 
In the Kaplan Meier analysis of TLOVR, the percentage of subjects with loss of virologic response was 
similar between treatment groups. At Week 48, 19% of subjects in the ATV/COBI +TVD group and 16% 
of subjects in the ATV/rtv +TVD group had loss of virologic response (overall p-value = 0.44).

Percentage of Subjects with Plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 48 
In the M = F analysis, the percentage of subjects with HIV-1 RNA levels < 50 copies/mL was similar in the 
ATV/co + TVD group and the ATV/r + TVD group from Week 2 through Week 48. At Week 48, the 
percentage of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA levels < 50 copies/mL was 89.0% (306 of 344 subjects) 
in the ATV/co + TVD group and 89.7% (312 of 348 subjects) in the ATV/r + TVD group. The 
stratum-weighted difference in response rate between treatment groups (ATV/co +TVD − ATV/r + TVD) 
was −0.7% (95% CI: −5.4% to 3.9%), indicating that ATV/co + TVD was non-inferior to ATV/r +T VD 
using the M = F method.  
In the M = E analysis, the percentage of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 48 was 
97.1% (306 of 315 subjects) in the ATV/co+TVD group and 96.0% (312 of 325 subjects) in the 
ATV/r+TVD group. The stratum-weighted difference in the response rate between treatment groups 
(ATV/co+TVD − ATV/r+TVD) was 1.1% (95% CI: −1.8% to 4.1%), indicating that ATV/co+TVD was 
non-inferior to ATV/r+TVD using the M = E method.

Change from Baseline in Plasma HIV-1 RNA 
Mean (SD) baseline HIV-1 RNA levels were 4.81 (0.585) log10 copies/mL in the ATV/co+TVD group and 
4.84 (0.594) log 10 copies/mL in the ATV/r+TVD group. HIV-1 RNA levels decreased following 
administration of study drug, and the mean decreases were similar in the ATV/co+TVD group and the 
ATV/r+TVD group at all time-points (Week 2 through Week 48). At Week 48, the mean (SD) decreases 
from baseline in HIV-1 RNA were −3.08 (0.658) log 10 copies/mL in the ATV/co+TVD group and −3.09 
(0.731) log10 copies/mL in the ATV/r+TVD group. The difference in least-squares means (LSM) was 
−0.01 (95% CI: −0.09 to 0.07). 
Change from Baseline in CD4 Cell Count at Week 48 
Mean (SD) baseline CD4 cell counts were 353 (170.5) cells/ìL in the ATV/co+TVD group and 351 (175.5) 
cells/ìL in the ATV/r+TVD group. CD4 counts increased following administration of study drug, and the 
mean increases were similar between the ATV/co+TVD and ATV/r+TVD groups at all time-points through 
Week 48. At Week 48, the mean (SD) increases from baseline in CD4 cell count were 213 (151.0) cells/ìL 
in the ATV/co+TVD group and 219 (150.4) cells/ìL in the ATV/r+TVD group. The difference in LSM from 
an ANOVA model was −5 (95% CI: −28 to 18). 
Change from Baseline in CD4 Percentage at Week 48 
In the ITT analysis set, mean (SD) baseline CD4% was 20.4% (8.72) in the ATV/co+TVD group and 
20.8% (8.42) in the ATV/r+TVD group. CD4% increased following administration of study drug, and the 
mean increases were similar between the 2 groups. At Week 48, the mean (SD) increases from baseline 
in CD4% were 9.7% (4.79) in the ATV/co+TVD group and 9.8% (5.27) in the ATV/r+TVD group. The 
difference in LSM was 0.0 (95% CI: −0.8 to 0.8). 
Additional Efficacy data provided during the evaluation 
Study GS-US-216-0114 is an ongoing, Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, active controlled 
study evaluating the efficacy and safety of COBI-boosted ATV versus ritonavir- boosted ATV in 
antiretroviral treatment-naive adult subjects with HIV-1 infection. A total of 698 subjects were 
randomized to receive ATV/co+TVD or ATV+RTV+TVD (349 subjects in each group) for 192 weeks. The 
intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis set included a total of 692 subjects who received at least one dose of study 
drug (ATV/co+TVD 344 subjects, ATV+RTV+TVD 348 subjects). 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of subjects with virologic success (HIV RNA < 50 
copies/mL) at Week 48 using the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defined snapshot analysis 
algorithm. The primary efficacy endpoint was evaluated in the Week 48 interim analysis and evaluated 
again in the Weeks 96 and 144 interim analyses. The interim Week 144 efficacy results are summarized 
in this section. 
Percentage of Subjects with HIV-1 RNA Cutoff at 50 copies/mL at Week 144 
High rates of virologic success were seen in both treatment groups at Week 144 in Study GS-US- 
216-0114 using the FDA-defined snapshot analysis algorithm with HIV 1 RNA < 50 copies/mL for the ITT 
analysis set (ATV/co+TVD 72.1%, 248 of 344 subjects; ATV+RTV+TVD 74.1%, 258 of 348 subjects). The 
difference in the percentages of subjects with virologic success was –2.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 
-8.7% to 4.5%). 
EMA/517796/2015  
Page 68/98 
 
 
  
 
 
Subgroup analyses at Week 144 based on the FDA-defined snapshot analysis algorithm revealed high and 
generally comparable rates of virologic success between treatment groups within subgroups according to 
age, sex, race, baseline HIV 1 RNA level, baseline CD4 cell count, and study drug adherence rate.

c Discontinuation due to other reasons includes subjects who discontinued study drug due to investigator’s discretion, withdrew 
consent, lost to follow-up, subject noncompliance, protocol violation, and pregnancy 
d Week 144 window is between Day 967 and Day 1050 (inclusive) 
Percentage of Subjects with HIV-RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 144 
Using the missing = failure (M=F) method, the percentage of subjects in Study GS-US-216-0114 with 
HIV-1 RNA levels < 50 copies/mL was similar in each treatment group through Week 144 (Week 144: 
ATV/co+TVD 77.3%, 266 of 344 subjects; ATV+RTV+TVD 80.2%, 279 of 348 subjects). The 
stratum-weighted difference in response rate between treatment groups at Week 144 (ATV/co+TVD 
− ATV+RTV+TVD) was −2.9% (95% CI: −9.0% to 3.2%). While using the missing = excluded (M=E) 
method, the percentage of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 144 was similar in 
the 2 treatment groups (ATV/co+TVD 96.0%, 266 of 277 subjects; ATV+RTV+TVD 96.9%, 279 of 288 
subjects). The stratum-weighted difference in the response rate between treatment groups (ATV/co+TVD 
− ATV+RTV+TVD) was –0.8% (95% CI: −4.0% to 2.4%)

Change from Baseline in CD4 Cell Count 
CD4 cell counts increased following initiation of study drug, and the mean increases were generally similar 
in the 2 treatment groups through Week 144 of Study GS-US-216-0114. The mean (SD) increases from 
baseline using the M=E method were 310 (188.0) cells/µL for ATV/co+TVD and 332 (199.9) cells/µL for 
ATV+RTV+TVD. 
Similar increases were observed when using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation 
method (ATV/co+TVD 281 [199.0] cells/µL; ATV+RTV+TVD 297 [208.1] cells/µL). The CD4 cell counts 
continued to increase with increased duration of exposure to study drug. 
Summary of Clinical Resistance Findings 
Of the 692 randomized and treated subjects in Study GS-US-216-0114, 40 subjects (5.9%) with either 
suboptimal virologic response or virologic rebound were analyzed for resistance development through 
Week 144 (ATV/co+TVD 21 of 344, 6.1%; ATV+RTV+TVD 19 of 348, 5.5%). 
Resistance development to 1 or more components of ATV/co+TVD or ATV+RTV+TVD occurred 
infrequently in this study. Three subjects (3 of 344, 0.9%) in the ATV/co+TVD group developed a 
resistance mutation to emtricitabine (FTC). Two subjects developed M184V and phenotypic resistance to 
FTC. One subject developed M184V as a mixture with wild-type with no phenotypic resistance to FTC. One 
subject (1 of 348, 0.3%) in the ATV+RTV+TVD group developed M184V and phenotypic resistance to 
FTC. No subject developed K65R or K70E in the reverse transcriptase gene and/or phenotypic resistance 
to TDF in either treatment group. There was no development of primary protease inhibitor resistance 
(PI-R) mutations within either treatment group.

Supportive study  
Study GS-US-216-0105 
A Phase 2, randomised, double-blinded study conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of GS-9350 
(COBI)-boosted Atazanavir (ATV/GS-9350) compared to ritonavir-boosted Atazanavir (ATV/r) in 
Combination with Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (FTC/TDF) in HIV-1 Infected, 
Antiretroviral Treatment-Naïve Adults.  
Subjects enrolled in this study were HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral treatment-naive subjects who met the 
following criteria: 
• 
Plasma HIV-1 RNA levels ≥ 5000 copies/mL at screening 
•  Cluster determinant 4 (CD4) cell count > 50 cells/ìL 
•  No prior use of any approved or experimental anti-HIV drug 
•  No nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), non-nucleoside reverse 
transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or primary protease inhibitor (PI) resistance mutations (by current 
International Antiviral Society-United States of America [IAS-USA] guidelines [December 2008]) in a 
screening genotype report 
Treatments 
Treatment Group 1: COBI 150 mg once daily + RTV placebo once daily + ATV 300 mg once daily + TVD 
(single-tablet FTC/TDF 200/300 mg) once daily (n = 50) 
Treatment Group 2: RTV 100 mg once daily + COBI placebo once daily + ATV 300 mg once daily + TVD 
(single-tablet FTC/TDF 200/300 mg) once daily (n = 25) 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was as follows: 
• 
To evaluate the efficacy of a regimen containing COBI-boosted ATV (ATV/co)+TVD versus 
RTV-boosted ATV (ATV/r)+TVD in HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral treatment naive adult subjects as 
determined by the achievement of HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) < 50 copies/mL at Week 24 
The secondary objectives of this study were as follows: 
• 
• 
To evaluate the efficacy of a regimen containing ATV/co+TVD versus ATV/r+TVD in HIV-1 infected, 
antiretroviral treatment-naive adult subjects as determined by the achievement of HIV-1 RNA < 50 
copies/mL at Week 48 
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the 2 treatment regimens through 48 weeks of treatment 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 24. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints included: 
• 
The proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 48 
EMA/517796/2015

• 
The change from baseline in log10 HIV-1 RNA and in CD4 cell count at Weeks 24 and 48 Subjects who 
experienced either suboptimal virologic response or virologic rebound were considered to have 
virologic failure, and had their HIV-1 genotype/phenotype analysed using PhenoSense GT Assay. 
Pharmacokinetics 
An intensive PK sub-study was performed at the Week 2, 4, or 8 visit in a subset of subjects (target n = 
24 evaluable) at selected study sites. A single trough (pre-dose) PK blood sample was collected for all 
subjects 20 to 24 hours following an observed (in clinic) dose of study drugs at Weeks 8, 24, and 48. In 
addition, a single PK blood sample was collected at Weeks 2, 4, 12, 16, 32, and 40 for non-sub-study 
subjects. The PK of ATV, COBI, COBI metabolites, FTC, TFV, and RTV were explored. 
Sample size 
A sample size of 50 subjects in the COBI group (Treatment Group 1) was chosen to estimate the response 
rate of HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 24 for the regimen to allow for the planning of Phase 3 studies. 
A total sample size of 75 subjects has 26% power to evaluate non-inferiority with respect to the response 
rate of HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 24 if a response rate of 84% for both groups and a 
non-inferiority margin of 0.12 are assumed. A total of 85 subjects were actually enrolled in the study, with 
79 subjects dosed, 4 subjects more than the sample size planned (75 subjects). 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to Treatment Group 1 or Treatment Group 2. Randomization was 
stratified by HIV-1 RNA level (≤100,000 copies/mL or > 100,000 copies/mL) at screening. A block size of 
6 subjects was used for randomisation. 
Statistical methods 
The primary analysis of efficacy was based on the ITT analysis set for randomized treatment groups. The 
secondary analysis of efficacy was based on the PP analysis set. The primary efficacy endpoint, the 
number and percentage of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL was summarized at Week 24. 
The primary analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint was analysed using the missing equals failure 
(M=F) method, all missing data were considered as failure (HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL), and included in 
the denominator for calculating the percentage of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL. 
The secondary analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint was analysed using missing or ART switch 
equals failure (M/S=F) method, in which all missing data and the HIV-1 RNA assessment data after the 
ART switch were considered as failure (HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL), and included in the denominator for 
calculating the percentage of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL. 
In the above M=F analysis and M/S=F analysis for all ATV/co+TVD efficacy analysis set, the denominator 
is the number of all ATV/co+TVD efficacy analysis set. Using the missing equals excluded (M=E) method, 
all missing data was excluded from the percentage calculation, ie, all missing data was excluded from 
both the numerator and the denominator. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was assessed for non-inferiority of treatment with ATV/co+TVD relative to 
treatment with ATV/r+TVD. Non-inferiority was assessed using a conventional 95% confidence interval 
(CI) approach, with a delta of 0.12

Numbers analysed 
Of the 85 subjects who were randomized, 79 were included in the safety and ITT analysis sets (6 subjects 
were randomized but were not dosed with study drug). Nine subjects were excluded from the PP analysis 
set due to either discontinuation of study drug prior to Week 48 (n = 8) or non-adherence to study drug 
(n = 1) 
Outcomes and estimation 
The percentage of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 24 (ITT, M=F) was 84.0% 
(42/50) in the ATV/co+TVD group and 89.7% (26/29) in the ATV/r+TVD group. The baseline HIV-1 RNA 
stratum-weighted difference in the response rate between the 2 treatment groups was −7.4% (95% CI: 
−24.6% to 9.9%; p = 0.37). Using the M/S=F method, in which 1 additional subject was considered to be 
a failure, the percentage of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 24 was 84.0% 
(42/50) in the ATV/co+TVD group and 86.2% (25/29) in the ATV/r+TVD group. The baseline HIV-1 RNA 
stratum-weighted difference in the response rate between the 2 treatment groups was −4.4% (95% CI: 
−22.5% to 13.6%; p = 0.60). Using the M=E method, the percentage of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA 
< 50 copies/mL at Week 24 was 91.3% (42/46) in the ATV/co+ TVD group and 96.3% (26/27) in the 
ATV/r+ TVD group. The baseline HIV-1 RNA stratum-weighted difference in the response rate between 
the 2 treatment groups was −7.3% (95% CI: −22.3% to 7.8%; p = 0.26).

(ITT Analysis Set) 
a HIV-1 RNA results were from HIV Cobas Amplicor version 1.5 assay only. 
b The 95% CI for proportion estimate of HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL for each treatment was obtained using Exact method. 
c P-values were from the CMH tests stratified by baseline HIV-1 RNA category (<= 100,000 or > 100,000 copies/mL). 
Difference in percentages of success and its 95% CI were calculated based on baseline HIV-1 RNA stratum-adjusted Mantel-Haenszel 
(MH) proportion. 
d For missing = failure: Denominator for percentage was the number of subjects in ITT analysis set. P-value and percentage difference 
(95% CI) were based on a binary response: success (HIV RNA <50 c/mL) and failure (HIV RNA >=50 copies/mL or missing). 
e For missing/ART switch: Denominator for percentage was the number of subjects in the ITT analysis set. P-value and percentage 
difference (95% CI) were based on a binary response: success (HIV-1 RNA<50) and failure (HIV-1 
RNA>=50, missing, ART switch). Subjects who discontinued study drug and had no follow-up information on new 
ART were treated as having an ART switch. The commercial ATR switch for subjects who were randomized to and treated in ATR group 
was not considered an ART switch. 
f For missing = excluded: Denominator for percentage was the number of subjects in the ITT analysis set with non-missing HIV-1 RNA 
value at each visit. P-value, percentage difference, and its 95% CI were based on a binary response: success (HIV-1 RNA < 50

The percentage of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL (ITT, M=F) at Week 48 was 82.0% in 
the ATV/co+TVD group and 89.7% in the ATV/r+TVD group. At Week 48, the baseline HIV-1 RNA 
stratum-weighted difference in the response rate between the 2 treatment groups was −8.3% (95% CI: 
−25.9% to 9.4%; p = 0.34). Similar results were obtained using the M/S=F method in which 1 additional 
subject was considered to be a failure. 
Using the M=E method, the percentage of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 48 
was 89.1% (41/46) in the ATV/co+TVD group and 96.3% (26/27) in the ATV/r+TVD group. At Week 48, 
the baseline HIV-1 RNA stratum-weighted difference in the response rate between the 2 treatment 
groups was −7.8% (95% CI: −23.0% to 7.4%; p = 0.26).

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The clinical efficacy of ATV/COBI FDC is primarily focused on a pharmacokinetic bridging clinical 
programme based on demonstrating the bioequivalence of ATV when co-administered with COBI either as 
the FDC (formulation G006) or the single agents under fed conditions. This approach is considered 
acceptable because this FDC is proposed as a ‘substitution indication’ of an already approved regimen 
(Cobicistat is already approved for use as a pharmacokinetic-enhancer of ATV). 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Two studies have been conducted in which ATV and COBI were used as part of the regimen to support this 
proposed substitution indication; an ongoing phase 2 study, GS-US-216-0105 and a phase 3 study, 
GS-US-216-0114 (these studies were part of the registration dossier for COBI). 
GS-US-216-0114 
The primary objective of this double blind study was to evaluate the efficacy of a regimen containing 
ATV/COBI versus ATV/rtv, each administered with TVD through 48 weeks of treatment and secondarily to 
assess the efficacy of the regimen in terms of virologic response (plasma viral load <50 copies/mL) at 24 
and 48 weeks using a snap-shot analysis and secondarily to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability 
of the 2 treatment regimens through 192 weeks of treatment. The study population consisted of a 
treatment-naïve population with HIV demonstrated to be susceptible to ATV, FTC and TDF. The baseline 
characteristics of the study population were comparable with those reported from many other studies in 
the ART-naïve. 
The pre-defined non-inferiority margin was -12% and may be considered to be slightly wide but this is not 
considered to be an issue because the results demonstrates that the lower bound of the 95% CI fall within 
10% for both the primary and sensitivity analyses. It was also apparent that ATV/COBI provided rates for 
< 50 copies/mL that were comparable with ATV/RTV in the subsets with HIV RNA > 100,000 copies/mL at 
baseline and CD4 < 350 cells/mm-3. Additional analyses were performed for subjects with baseline HIV-1 
RNA ≤ 100,000, > 100,000 to ≤ 400,000, and > 400,000 and for subjects with baseline CD4 count ≤ 
200 cells/μL, > 200 to ≤ 350 cells/μL and > 350 cells/μL. These results indictaed that the efficacy of 
ATV/COBI+TVD was generally consistent and comparable within each subgroup analyzedThe rationale for 
including planned interim analyses by the IDMC was not considered that these threatened the integrity of 
the primary analysis.  
GS-US-216-0105 
This supportive study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of a regimen containing COBI-boosted ATV 
(ATV/co +TVD versus RTV-boosted ATV (ATV/r) +TVD in HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral treatment naive 
adult subjects as determined by the achievement of HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) < 50 copies/mL at Week 
24. The design, non-inferiority margin, study population and baseline characteristics were comparable 
with those of the phase 3 study. 
The results from this Phase 2 study suggested that ATV/COBI was numerically inferior to ATV/RTV. This 
is however not considered to be an issue as the pivotal Phase 3 study provided primary and sensitivity 
analyses that demonstrated non-inferiority for ATV/COBI vs. RTV/COBI although small numerical 
differences were also apparent. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
ATV/COBI in combination TVD is non-inferior to ATV/RTV + TVD through to 48 weeks and the additional 
sensitivity analyses conducted support this finding. Week 144 efficacy results confirmed the efficacy 
EMA/517796/2015  
Page 80/98 
 
 
  
 
 
observed over 48 weeks. Resistance development to 1 or more components of ATV/co+TVD or 
ATV+RTV+TVD occurred infrequently in Study GS-US-216-0114.  
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy data from the studies support the use of COBI as a pharmacokinetic-enhancer of ATV and 
since the ATV/COBI FDC tablet has been demonstrated to be bioequivalent to the single components, it is 
considered that these results can be extrapolated to the FDC.  Additional efficacy studies were provided, 
as well as supportive studies on the individual components. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Study AI424511 was conducted by the Applicant in order to demonstrate the bioequivalence of the FDC 
and will be assessed in terms of the safety results. This is the only study in which the safety of the FDC has 
been specifically evaluated, whereas not at the long-term pattern of exposure expected in clinical use. 
No other studies have been specifically conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the FDC 
combination. However studies with the individual components contained in the FDC were submitted in 
support of this application.  
The data submitted derived from studies 216-105 and 216-0114 which have been described for the 
supportive efficacy data.  
Study AI424511 
Study AI424511 was an open-label, single-dose, 5-period, 5-treatment, randomized crossover study in 
healthy subjects. Subjects were equally randomized to 1 of 8 treatment sequences. Subjects received a 
300 mg ATV capsule coadministered with a 150 mg COBI tablet or FDC tablet of ATV/COBI (300/150 mg) 
following a light meal (Treatments A or B, respectively) according to the assigned treatment sequences on 
Days 1 and 8. On Days 15 and 22, subjects received a 300 mg ATV capsule coadministered with a 150 mg 
COBI tablet or FDC tablet of ATV/COBI (300/150 mg) under fasted conditions (Treatments C or D, 
respectively) according to the assigned treatment sequences. On Day 29, approximately half of the 
subjects, according to the assigned sequence, received FDC tablet of ATV/COBI (300/150 mg) following 
a high fat meal (Treatment E). There was a 7-day washout period between all treatments. Approximately 
half of the subjects, according to assigned sequences, were to be discharged from the study at the end of 
Period 4 (Day 24) and the remaining subjects continued to Period 5 and were to be discharged at the end 
of Period 5 (Day 31). 
A total of 149 subjects were enrolled, and 64 subjects were randomized to receive treatment with 
ATV/COBI. Only 2 subjects discontinued prior to study completion. Sixty-four subjects received study 
medication based on 1 of the 8 treatment sequences, of which 32 subjects were to receive treatments 
through Period 4 (a total of 4 treatments) and the remaining 32 subjects were to receive treatments 
through Period 5 (a total of 5 treatments).  
Two subjects discontinued study medication. All 64 subjects receiving study medication were included in 
the safety dataset. At baseline, the mean age was 33 years (range: 18 - 48 years), the majority of 
subjects were male, and 52% of the subjects were Black. All subjects were healthy with no history of 
significant disease.

Table 24.  Subject Disposition ( Study AI424511) 
Pooled studies 216-105 and 216-0114 
Overall, 394 subjects received ATV+COBI+TVD in these 2 studies, and 377 subjects received 
ATV+RTV+TVD. The median duration of exposure to study drug was 48.4 weeks in the ATV+COBI+TVD 
group and 48.3 weeks in the ATV+RTV+TVD group. 
At baseline, the overall mean (standard deviation [SD]) HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) was 4.81 (0.595) 
log10 copies/mL, mean (SD) CD4 count was 353 (174.8) cells/µL, and mean CD4 percentage was 21% 
(8.62%). Overall, 62% of subjects had baseline HIV-1 RNA ≤ 100,000 copies/mL. The majority of 
subjects (83%) had asymptomatic HIV-1 infection. Eight percent of subjects were diagnosed with 
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. 
Adverse events 
Study AI424511 
Twenty subjects (31%) had AEs. The most common AE was dizziness (6%). All AEs resolved by study 
completion. All AEs were mild to moderate intensity. The most common AEs (≥ 2 subjects) are 
summarized in Table 25.

Six subjects (9%) had AEs considered related to the study drug by the investigator. Related AEs were 
dizziness (3 subjects [5%]), headache and vomiting (2 subjects [3%] each), and abdominal discomfort, 
nausea, and vision blurred (1 subject [2%] each). 
Pooled studies 216-105 and 216-0114 
Ten percent of subjects in the ATV+COBI+TVD group and 7% of subjects in the ATV+RTV+TVD group had 
serious adverse events (SAEs). The incidence of treatment-emergent AEs was similar in both groups 
(92%).The most frequently reported treatment-emergent AEs in the ATV+COBI+TVD group were 
jaundice, ocular icterus, and nausea, and the most frequently reported treatment-emergent AEs in the 
ATV+RTV+TVD group were diarrhoea, ocular icterus, and nausea. 
The most frequent treatment-emergent AEs reported in ≥ 5% of subjects in either group are summarized 
in Table 27.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Study AI424511 
No deaths, SAEs, or discontinuations due to AEs were reported. 
Pooled studies 216-105 and 216-0114 
No deaths were reported during the two studies. The incidence of Grade 3 -4 treatment-emergent AEs 
were 18% and 13% in the ATV+COBI+TVD and ATV+RTV+TVD groups, respectively. Grade 3 - 4 
treatment-emergent AEs were reported in 18% and 13% of subjects in the ATV+COBI+TVD and 
ATV+RTV+TVD groups, respectively. The difference was driven by Grade 3 events, as Grade 4 AEs were 
balanced and reported for 2 subjects in the ATV+COBI+TVD group and 3 subjects in the ATV+RTV+TVD 
group. Most Grade 3 - 4 treatment-emergent AEs were not considered related to the study drug by the 
investigators. 
No pattern was apparent in specific types of AEs of higher incidence in the ATV+COBI+TVD group, with 
the exception of AEs associated with bilirubin elevations (i.e., ocular icterus, hyperbilirubinemia, 
jaundice, blood bilirubin increased), which are events reported in the ATV prescribing information as 
related to ATV use. The only other Grade 3 - 4 treatment-emergent AE reported in ± 1% of subjects in 
either treatment group was acute renal failure, which was reported for 0 subjects in the ATV+COBI+TVD 
group and 4 subjects (1%) in the ATV+RTV+TVD group.

Related Treatment-emergent Adverse Events 
Treatment-emergent AEs considered related to the study drug were reported in 57% of subjects in each 
group. The most frequently reported AEs considered related to the study drug by the investigators in the 
ATV+COBI+TVD and ATV+RTV+TVD groups, respectively, were ocular icterus (15% vs. 17%), nausea 
(12% vs. 11%), and jaundice (14% vs. 11%). 
Laboratory findings 
Study AI424511 
The overall incidence of laboratory abnormalities was low. The most frequently occurring laboratory 
abnormalities were high total bilirubin and high white blood cells in the urine. None of the laboratory 
abnormalities was considered clinically significant, and none was reported as an AE. 
Haematology 
Hematologic laboratory abnormalities were low leukocytes (4 subjects [6%]) and low absolute 
neutrophils (5 subjects [8%]). These laboratory abnormalities were within normal limits at end of study. 
Serum Chemistries 
EMA/517796/2015  
Page 85/98 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Nine subjects had a total of 12 serum chemistry Mas. Serum chemistry laboratory abnormalities were 
high total bilirubin (6 subjects [9%]), high CK and high direct bilirubin (2 subjects [3%] each), and high 
aspartate aminotransferase and high dehydrogenase (1 subject [2%] each). None of the subjects met the 
criteria for potential drug-induced liver injury (i.e., alanine aminotransferase > 3 x upper limit of normal 
[ULN] and total bilirubin > 2 x ULN). 
Urinalysis 
Urinalysis laboratory abnormalities were high white blood cells in the urine (7 subjects [11%]), high blood 
in the urine (3 subjects [5%]), and high red blood cells in the urine (2 subjects [3%]). Laboratory 
abnormalities were within normal limits at end of study. 
Physical findings and cardiologic evaluation 
There was no evidence of any clinically relevant effect of the administration of ATV/COBI 300 mg/150 mg 
on vital signs. No subject had a QT interval > 500 msec and 1 subject had a QTcF interval (453 msec) > 
450 msec on 1 ECG that was not considered clinically significant by the investigator. Three subjects had 
investigator-identified ECG abnormalities that were not present prior to study drug administration: 2 
subjects had sinus bradycardia and 1 subject had a QRS duration abnormality. None of the abnormalities 
was reported as an AE or considered clinically significant by the investigator 
Pooled studies 216-105 and 216-0114 
The majority of subjects had at least 1 treatment-emergent laboratory abnormality reported. Among 
subjects with post-baseline laboratory assessments, 99% of subjects in both groups had laboratory 
abnormalities (Grade 1 - 4). 
Treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 abnormalities were reported in 75% and 64% of subjects in the 
ATV+COBI+TVD and ATV+RTV+TVD groups, respectively. The difference between groups was driven 
predominantly by abnormalities of total bilirubin. 
The most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 abnormalities were as follows: 
•  ATV+COBI+TVD group — total bilirubin (49% Grade 3, 16% Grade 4, n = 255), lipase (7% Grade 
3, 2% Grade 4, n = 4 of 44 subjects assessed), and creatinine kinase (CK) (3% Grade 3, 3% 
Grade 4, n = 21). 
•  ATV+RTV+TVD group — total bilirubin (45% Grade 3, 11% Grade 4, n = 211), lipase (6% Grade 
3, 0 subjects Grade 4, n = 2 of 34 subjects assessed), and CK (2% Grade 3, 4% Grade 4, n = 22). 
Renal Laboratory Parameters 
Increases from baseline in median serum creatinine in the ATV+COBI+TVD group were noted as early as 
Week 2 (median change from baseline at Week 2 was 0.11 mg/dL), after which it generally stabilized 
through Week 48 (median change from baseline at Week 48 was 0.13 mg/dL). The pattern of change in 
serum creatinine in the ATV+RTV+TVD group was similar (median change from baseline at Week 2 was 
0.05 mg/dL; median change from baseline at Week 48 was 0.09 mg/dL). 
Modest decreases in median estimated glomerular filtration rate calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault 
equation (eGFRCG) were observed post-baseline in the ATV+COBI+TVD group (baseline median 111.2 
mL/min and median change from baseline at Week 48 of –12.9 mL/min) and ATV+RTV+TVD group 
(baseline median 114.5 mL/min and median change from baseline at Week 48 of –9.3 mL/min). 
Decreases in eGFRCG were seen as early as Week 2, with only minimal additional decreases after that 
time point; median values remained within the normal range. 
Other Observations Related to Safety 
EMA/517796/2015  
Page 86/98 
 
 
  
 
 
In Study GS-US-216-0114, 2 subjects in each group with normal electrocardiograms (ECGs) at baseline 
developed clinically significant abnormal ECGs by Week 48. In Study GS-US-216-0105, 1 subject in the 
ATV+COBI+TVD group and 2 subjects in the ATV+RTV+TVD group had clinically significant ECG findings 
reported. 
Safety in special populations 
Not evaluated. 
Immunological events 
Rash was reported in 6.1% of each of the two comparative treatment groups in studies 216-105 and 
216-0114 and no other hypersensitivity related events are discussed. This frequency is in line with the 
current information for the product and with the proposed frequency in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In study AI424511, no discontinuations due to AEs were reported. 
In the pooled studies 216-115 and 216-0104, 7% of subjects in both groups had treatment-emergent AEs 
that led to discontinuation of the study drug. Events associated with hyperbilirubinemia, such as jaundice 
(2% in both groups) and ocular icterus (2% in the ATV+COBI+TVD group and 1% in the ATV+RTV+TVD 
group) were the only AEs that led to discontinuation of study drug in > 1% of subjects in either group. 
Post marketing experience 
Not applicable. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
About 400 subjects have been treated with ATV/COBI in combination with TVD with a median duration of 
exposure of 48 weeks and 64 healthy subjects have been treated with ATV/COBI FDC.  
In studies GS-US-216-0105 and GS-US-216-0114 the incidence of grade 3 -4 treatment-emergent AEs 
was slightly higher in the ATV+COBI+TVD (18%) compared with ATV/COBI + TVD (13%).  
In terms of adverse events and taking into consideration the known adverse event profile for both ATV 
and COBI, the following is noted; there was no excess of renal AEs or renal laboratory anomalies in the 
COBI Phase 2 and 3 studies except for the recognised effect on serum creatinine and higher rates of 
hypophosphataemia and of Grade 3 glycosuria and haematuria. 
Adverse events associated with bilirubin elevations which relate to ATV use were noted to be higher in the 
ATV+COBI+TVD group.  
ATV/COBI was associated with higher rates of elevated AST and ALT although the frequency of occurrence 
of these events at 3 x ULN or more in conjunction with elevated bilirubin was comparable with the 
ATV/RTV group. 
 Even though the number of subjects reporting any SAE was higher in the ATV/COBI group (38 vs. 25; 
9.6% vs. 6.6%) there was no apparent clustering of SAEs of any one SOC or PT that can explain this 
overall difference. 
In study GS-US216-0114, the median (first quartile [Q1] – third quartile [Q3]) duration of exposure to 
study drug was 146.3 weeks (143.0–155.6) in the ATV/co+TVD group and 145.1 weeks (142.8–155.5) in 
the ATV+RTV+TVD group. The majority of subjects in each treatment group received study drug for ≥ 
EMA/517796/2015  
Page 87/98 
 
 
  
 
 
 
144 weeks (ATV/co+TVD 72.7%, 250 subjects;  TV+RTV+TVD 70.7%, 246 subjects). As observed for 
week 48, higher percentages of subjects in the ATV/co+TVD group reported any Grade 3 or 4 AE 
(ATV/co+TVD 27.0%, 93 subjects; ATV+RTV+TVD 21.0%, 73 subjects) or any serious AEs (SAEs) 
(ATV/co+TVD 17.7%, 61 subjects; ATV+RTV+TVD 12.9%, 45 subjects). However, similar percentages of 
subjects in each group reported Grade 3 or 4 AEs considered related to study drug (ATV/co+TVD 8.1%, 
28 subjects; ATV+RTV+TVD 6.6%, 23 subjects) or SAEs considered related to study drug (ATV/co+TVD 
1.7%, 6 subjects; ATV+RTV+TVD 2.9%, 10 subjects). 
Common AEs were consistent with those expected in the subject population and the known safety profiles 
of the study drugs. 
One non-treatment-emergent death occurred during Study GS-US-216-0114 in a subject in the 
ATV+RTV+TVD group. Death was due to left parieto-occipital intra-parenchymal hemorrhage on Day 
604, while no deaths were reported for the ATV/co+TVD group. 
Discontinuation of study drug due to AEs occurred in similar percentages of subjects in the 2 treatment 
groups (ATV/co+TVD 11.0%, 38 subjects; ATV+RTV+TVD 11.2%, 39 subjects). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the data suggest that ATV/COBI is generally well tolerated. No particular concern has been 
identified with this fixed dose combination or ATV/cobi given as single agents to date.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Atazanavir is a well-established compound for use in the treatment of HIV-infection, with adequate 
antiviral activity and the possibility of once-daily dosing. 
Cobicistat has previously demonstrated to be an acceptable pharmacokinetic enhancer of atazanavir, with 
EMA/517796/2015  
Page 95/98 
 
 
  
 
 
 
boosting activity comparable to that of the widely used compound ritonavir. 
The combination may provide for the simplification of treatment regimen, since there is currently no 
co-formulation of atazanavir with a pharmacokinetic enhancer available for clinical use. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The clinical program for ATV/COBI FDC is primarily based on a pharmacokinetic bridging clinical 
programme based on demonstrating the bioequivalence of ATV when co-administered with COBI either as 
the FDC (formulation G006) or the single agents under fed conditions. The ATV/COBI FDC is proposed as 
a ‘substitution indication’ of an already approved regimen. The efficacy data provided therefore consists 
only of studies conducted with the single components i.e. ATV and COBI (ATV/COBI)with a bioequivalence 
study conducted in the fed state to bridge the data from the single components to the proposed FDC; no 
efficacy study has been conducted using the FDC.  
Cobicistat has shown a trend towards a slightly lower response at 48 weeks relative to the use of ritonavir 
boosted atazanavir, while the results of the two supportive studies in which the compounds were used 
separately are within the non-inferiority range and there were no notable differences in terms of the 
emergence of resistant strains. This trend was maintained at the week 144 interim analysis, while still 
within the non-inferiority margin. Virologic failure rates at week 144 were higher for the EVOTAZ group 
(8.1% versus 4.9%) with 3 discontinuations due to lack of efficacy in the EVOTAZ group and none in the 
ATV/RTV group.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety of the FDC tablet is supported by the safety of the individual components (i.e. safety data from 
GS-US-216-0105 and GS-US-216-0114) and the safety of the individual components given in 
combination and the FDC in the bioequivalence study (AI424511). About 400 subjects have been treated 
with ATV/COBI in combination with TVD with a median duration of exposure of 142 weeks and 64 healthy 
subjects have been treated with ATV/COBI FDC in the bioequivalence study AI 424511. 
In studies GS-US-216-0105 and GS-US-216-0114, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent 
AEs in the ATV+COBI+TVD group were jaundice, ocular icterus, and nausea. In study AI424511, the most 
common AE was dizziness (6%). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There are no clinical studies evaluating the safety of ATV/COBI FDC tablet in patients. In studies 
GS-US-216-0105 and GS-US-216-0114, the incidence of grade 3 -4 treatment-emergent AEs was slightly 
higher in the ATV+COBI+TVD (18%) compared with ATV/COBI + TVD (13%).  
There was no excess of renal AEs or renal laboratory anomalies in the COBI Phase 2 and 3 studies except 
for the recognised effect on serum creatinine and higher rates of hypophosphataemia and of Grade 3 
glycosuria and haematuria. 
Adverse events associated with bilirubin elevations which relate to ATV use were noted to be higher in the 
ATV+COBI+TVD group.  
ATV/COBI was associated with higher rates of elevated AST and ALT although the frequency of occurrence 
of these events at 3 x ULN or more in conjunction with elevated bilirubin was comparable with the 
ATV/RTV group. 
EMA/517796/2015  
Page 96/98 
 
 
  
 
 
It is considered that there are a few gaps regarding the safety of ATV/COBI given as a FDC in terms of the 
duration of exposure.  
No drug-drug interaction studies have been performed using ATV/Cobi FDC tablet formulations or ATV 
co-administered with Cobi as separate agents and the applicant bases the drug interaction potential on 
the interactions observed with each single agent and ATV when co-administered with rtv.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
COBI is a useful alternative to RTV as a pharmacokinetic-enhancer of specific antiretroviral agents that 
are substrates of CYP3A4. There are no identified safety concerns and it is actually already approved for 
use with ATV, Darunavir and other ART. Therefore the FDC is potentially useful as a substitution indication 
for ATV/rtv. The FDC has been demonstrated to be bioequivalent to the individual components in the fed 
state which is considered adequate as the efficacy studies were also conducted in the fed state and food 
is known to improve the bioavailability of ATV and reduce variability.  
Even though the number of subjects reporting any SAE was higher in the ATV/COBI group (38 vs. 25; 
9.6% vs. 6.6%) there was no apparent clustering of SAEs of any one SOC or PT that can explain this 
overall difference. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Considering the already demonstrated efficacy and safety profiles of the two compounds in the FDC and 
the potential for dosing simplification and the fact that it is not expected to be countered by the potential 
risks, the balance is currently considered positive. 
Antiretroviral efficacy was demonstrated in 344 treatment-naïve subjects, which appeared in line with 
that known for ATV/rtv. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the risk-benefit balance of Evotaz in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the 
treatment of HIV-1 infected adults without known mutations associated with resistance to atazanavir (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.1) is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing 
authorisation subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

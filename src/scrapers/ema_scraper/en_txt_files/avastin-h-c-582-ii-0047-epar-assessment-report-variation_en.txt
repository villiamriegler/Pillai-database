2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Avastin  was  approved  in  the  European  Union  (EU)  on  12  January  2005  for  the  first-line  treatment  of 
patients  with  metastatic  cancer  of  the  colon  or  rectum  (mCRC)  in  combination  with  fluoropyrimidine-
based  chemotherapy.  Following  this,  Avastin  was  approved  for  the  treatment  of  locally  recurrent  and 
metastatic breast cancer in combination with paclitaxel or capecitabine, for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 
(NSCLC) in addition to platinum-based chemotherapy, for the first-line treatment of Renal Cell Cancer 
(RCC)  in  combination  with  interferon  alfa-2a,  and  for  the  front-line  treatment  of  advanced  (FIGO 
stages  III  B,  III  C  and  IV)  epithelial  ovarian,  fallopian  tube,  or  primary  peritoneal  cancer  in 
combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel. 
With this variation application the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) proposed to update the 
following sections of the SmPC:  
- Section 5.1 of the SmPC to include results from AVANT study in adjuvant colon cell carcinoma. 
- Section 5.1 of the SmPC with the results from two studies in children aged > 3 years old with 
relapsed or progressive high-grade glioma. In addition, section 4.2 of the SmPC has been updated to 
include a statement that avastin should not be used in children aged 3 years to less than 18 years with 
recurrent or progressive high-grade glioma in order to reflect the results from the paediatric studies. 
Regarding  the  paediatric  studies,  in  July  2010  an  application  for  a  Paediatric  Investigation  Plan  (PIP) 
for bevacizumab in view of new indications being developed was submitted to the European Medicines 
Agency.  During  the  procedure,  the  Paediatric  Committee  (PDCO)  concluded  that  no  paediatric  trial 
should be required for the paediatric development of bevacizumab in children over the age of 3 years 
with  relapsed  high-grade  glioma,  since  2  studies  published  in  2010  indicated  to  the  PDCO  a  lack  of 
activity  of  bevacizumab  in  children  with  refractory/recurrent  or  relapsed  high-grade  glioma  / 
glioblastoma.  However  the  applicant  was  advised  to  submit  the  data  for  assessment  and  for  any 
update of the product information as appropriate, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 
1906/2006 
 
In  a  single-arm  phase  II  study  conducted  by  the  Paediatric  Brain  Tumour  Consortium  (study 
PBTC-022),  paediatric  patients  with  recurrent  malignant  glioma  and  intrinsic  brainstem  glioma 
were treated with bevacizumab and irinotecan. 
 
In  a  publication  from  Narayana  et  al.  (Neuro  oncol  2010),  a  retrospective  analysis  from  clinical 
records  of  a  single  institution  has  been  performed  on  12  children  with  a  relapsed  or  progressive 
high-grade glioma treated with bevacizumab and irinotecan. 
During the evaluation of the PIP the PDCO requested an update to the SmPC, according to Article 46 of 
the  Paediatric  Regulation,  to  reflect  the  results  observed  in  the  two  studies  mentioned  above.  In 
response to the PDCO’s request, the MAH submitted this variation to update section 5.1 of the SmPC to 
describe the lack of efficacy of bevacizumab observed in children aged 3 years or older with recurrent 
or progressive high-grade glioma.

2.2.  Clinical Efficacy aspects  
2.2.1Methods – analysis of data submitted 
  AVANT (BO17920) study  
The AVANT (BO17920) study was an open-label Phase III, multicenter, multinational, randomized, 3-
arm  study,  which  investigated  bevacizumab  (q3w  or  q2w),  in  combination  with  either  intermittent 
capecitabine  plus  oxaliplatin  (XELOX)  every  three  weeks,  or  fluorouracil/leucovorin  with  oxaliplatin 
(FOLFOX4)  every  two  weeks,  versus  FOLFOX4  regimen  alone,  as  adjuvant  chemotherapy  in  colon 
carcinoma (aCC). 
The treatment phase consisted of two parts of 24 weeks for a total of 48 weeks: 
 
 
The first part (weeks 1 to 24) with either FOLFOX4, FOLFOX4 + bevacizumab (Bv), or XELOX+Bv. 
The second part (weeks 25 to 48) with Bv as single-agent (3-week cycle for a total of 8 cycles) for 
patients randomized to either Bv-containing arm, or an observation period for patients assigned to 
the FOLFOX4-alone arm. 
The primary objectives were 
 
To  demonstrate  that  the  combination  of  Bv+FOLFOX4  is  superior  to  FOLFOX4  alone  in  terms  of 
disease-free  survival  (DFS)  in  chemotherapy-naïve  patients  who  underwent  surgery  with  curative 
intent for colon carcinoma (aCC patients). 
 
To demonstrate that the combination of Bv+XELOX is superior to FOLFOX4 alone in terms of DFS 
in aCC patients. 
The secondary objectives were 
 
To  demonstrate  that  the  combination  of  Bv+FOLFOX4  is  superior  to  FOLFOX4  alone  in  terms  of 
overall survival (OS) in aCC patients. 
 
To demonstrate that the combination of Bv+XELOX is superior to FOLFOX4 alone in terms of OS in 
aCC patients. 
 
In  case  both  primary  objectives  are  achieved,  to  further  investigate  if  the  combination  of 
Bv+XELOX is at least as efficacious as the combination of Bv+FOLFOX4 in terms of DFS and OS. 
 
 
To evaluate and compare the safety profiles of the treatment groups. 
To  evaluate  the  immunogenicity  of  Bv  measured  as  induction  of  human  anti-humanized  antibody 
(HAHA). 
  Paediatric studies  
Study PBTC-022 
A phase II study of bevacizumab plus irinotecan (CPT-11) was conducted in children with recurrent 
malignant glioma (MG) and intrinsic brainstem glioma (BSG). 
Eligible patients received two doses of Bv intravenously (10 mg/kg) two weeks apart and then Bv plus 
CPT-11 (125-350 mg/m²) once every two weeks until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or a 
maximum of two years of therapy. Correlative studies included diffusion weighted and T1 dynamic 
contrast–enhanced permeability imaging, Bv pharmacokinetics, and estimation of vascular endothelial 
growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) phosphorylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) 
after single-agent Bv. 
CHMP Variation Assessment Report

The primary objective of the study was to estimate the rate of sustained (≥8 weeks) objective 
response to Bv plus CPT-11 in children with recurrent malignant glioma (stratum A) or diffuse 
infiltrating pontine glioma (stratum B) over four courses of therapy. 
Narayana et al (Neuro Oncol 2010) 
In a retrospective single institution series, 12 consecutive (2005 to 2008) paediatric patients with 
relapsed or progressive high-grade glioma (3 with WHO grade IV, 9 with grade III) were treated with 
bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) and irinotecan (125 mg/m²) every 2 weeks. 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed prior to therapy and every 8 weeks subsequently. 
Radiological responses were defined according to MacDonald’s criteria. 
Progression free survival (PFS), OS and toxicities were analyzed. 
2.2.2 Results 
  AVANT (BO17920) study  
3451 high-risk stage II, or stage III colon cancer patients were randomized to the three study arms on 
a 1:1:1 basis, stratified according to geographic region and disease stage:  
  1151 patients to FOLFOX4 alone 
  1155 to FOLFOX4+Bv  
  1145 patients to XELOX+Bv 
Of  these,  2867  out  of  3451  patients  (83%)  had  stage  III  disease  and  formed  the  primary  population 
for the efficacy analyses. 
The AVANT study did not meet its primary endpoint: The p-value of the global hypothesis was 0.2024 
indicating that there was no difference in the distribution of DFS between the three treatment arms in 
patients  with  stage  III  disease  (n=2867).  Therefore,  all  other  efficacy  analyses  performed  were 
considered as exploratory only. 
The  results  favoured  the  control  arm  (FOLFOX4)  with  more  relapses  in  both  bevacizumab  arms.  The 
hazard ratios for DFS in patients with stage III disease were 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.98-
1.39) for the FOLFOX4+Bv arm and 1.07 (95% CI: 0.90-1.28) for the XELOX+Bv arm. 
In the first year, the risk of a DFS event in the Bv-containing arms was lower than in the control arm. 
The hazard ratios of DFS versus the FOLFOX4 arm were 0.63 (95% CI: 0.45-0.89) and 0.61 (95% CI: 
0.43-0.86) for FOLFOX4+Bv and XELOX+Bv arms, respectively. After one year, the risk of a DFS event 
in the Bv-containing arms became higher than in the control arm. 
The estimated hazard ratios for DFS in most subgroups were consistent with the overall estimate for all 
patients.  
The  OS  data  were  immature.  There  were  more  deaths  in  the  Bv-containing  arms  than  in  the  control 
arm. The hazard ratios versus the FOLFOX4 arm were 1.31 (95% CI: 1.03-1.67) for the FOLFOX4+Bv 
arm  and  1.27  (95%  CI:  0.99-1.62)  for  the  XELOX+Bv  arm  in  patients  with  stage  III  disease.  The 
results were consistent between most subgroups for OS, except for the group of patients with high-risk 
stage  II  disease.  In  this  subgroup,  the  unstratified  hazard  ratios  were  0.95  (95%CI:  0.49-1.84)  and 
0.62 (95%CI: 0.29-1.30) for the FOLFOX4+Bv arm and XELOX+Bv arm, respectively.  
Overall,  the  safety  profile  was  similar  and  consistent  to  the  previous  experience  observed  with  Bv  in 
combination with FOLFOX4 or XELOX, or as a monotherapy.

The  proportion  of  patients  with  adverse  events  (AEs)  of  all  grades  was  similar  across  the  treatment 
arms. Nausea/vomiting (all treatment arms) and neutropenia (FOLFOX4 arms) were the most common 
AEs ( ≥ 50% of patients). The proportion of patients with grade 3 to 5 AEs was greater in the FOLFOX4 
arms  (approximately  75%  vs.  65%  in  the  XELOX  arm),  mainly  accounted  for  by  neutropenia.  The 
proportion of patients with SAEs was greater in the Bv arms (FOLFOX4+Bv 26% and XELOX+Bv 25% 
vs. FOLFOX4 20%), mainly accounted for by gastrointestinal disorders. 
The major cause of death was disease progression. The same proportion of patients in each arm (2%) 
died due to causes other than disease progression. Deaths from causes other than colon cancer had no 
clear pattern and affected a range of body systems. 
  Paediatric studies  
PBTC-022 
There were 31 evaluable patients in the study, of whom 18 had non-pontine high-grade glioma (HGG) 
including 8 with glioblastoma (WHO grade IV), 9 patients with anaplastic astrocytoma (grade III) and 1 
with anaplastic oligodendroglioma (grade III). These patients received a median of two courses of Bv 
plus CPT-11 (range, 1 to 19). No sustained responses were observed in either stratum. Median time to 
progression was 127 days for MG and 71 days for BSG. Progression-free survival rates at 6 months 
were 41.8% and 9.7% for MG and BSG, respectively. Toxicities related to Bv included grade 1 to 3 
fatigue in seven patients, grade 1 to 2 hypertension in seven patients, grade 1 CNS haemorrhage in 
four patients and grade 4 CNS ischemia in two patients. The mean diffusion ratio decreased after two 
doses of Bv in patients with MG only. 
Vascular permeability parameters did not change significantly after therapy in either stratum. 
Inhibition of VEGFR-2 phosphorylation in PBMC was detected in eight of 11 patients after Bv exposure. 
Narayana et al (Neuro Oncol 2010) 
Ten patients had supratentorial HGG; two had Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG). Ten (83.3%) 
patients tolerated bevacizumab without serious toxicity. Therapy was discontinued in 1 patient because 
of anaphylaxis. Another patient developed grade III delayed wound healing and deep vein thrombosis. 
Two patients (16.7%) experienced a partial response after the first MRI. No complete radiographic 
responses were seen. Stable disease was noted in 4 (33.3%) patients. The median PFS and OS were 
2.25 and 6.25 months, respectively. A diffuse invasive recurrence pattern was noted in 5 (45.5%) 
patients.  
2.2.3 Discussion 
 
 AVANT (BO17920) study  
Based  on  the  results  in  this  study,  the  benefit/risk  balance  for  the  treatment  of  aCC  patients  with 
bevacizumab  is  considered  not  to  be  favourable.  The  MAH  proposed  to  update  the  section  5.1  of  the 
SmPC to reflect the findings from this study.  
However  the  CHMP  considered  that  section  5.1  of  the  SmPC  should  mention  information  which  is 
relevant  to  the  prescriber  and  to  other  health-care  professionals,  taking  into  account  the  approved 
therapeutic indications and the potential adverse drug reactions. Since Avastin is not indicated for the 
adjuvant  treatment  of  colorectal  cancer  the  proposed  information  from  the  AVANT  study  is  not 
considered appropriate to be included in the SmPC.  
  Paediatric studies  
CHMP Variation Assessment Report 
EMA/CHMP/226681/2012  
Page 7/10
 
 
 
 
Based on the results of the paediatric studies the MAH suggested to update section 5.1 with the 
statement that anti-tumour activity was not observed in two studies among a total of eleven children 
aged > 3 years old with relapsed glioblastoma when treated with bevacizumab and irinotecan and that 
there is insufficient information to determine the safety and efficacy of Avastin in children with 
glioblastoma. However the CHMP concluded that there is sufficient information in the 
relapsed/recurrent setting > 3 years, therefore the above statements should be revised under section 
5.1 and section 4.2 of the SmPC should be updated as well to include a statement that avastin should 
not be used in children aged 3 years to less than 18 years with recurrent or progressive high-grade 
glioma in order to reflect the results from the paediatric studies. 
Furthermore the CHMP requested the MAH to describe the results from the two paediatric studies with 
more  details  under  section  5.1  in  order  to  be  in  line  with  the  SmPC  guideline.  Information  should 
include the results of the main endpoints, the main characteristics of the population studied (including 
age and numbers of patients), the doses used and any information on safety. 
In reply to CHMP ‘s request the MAH updated both sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC. 
2.2.4 Changes to the Product Information 
During the procedure, the CHMP requested further amendments to the PI (new wording in bold and 
underlined) as discussed in detail above:  
  4.2 Posology and method of administration 
Paediatric population 
[…] 
Avastin should not be used in children aged 3 years to less than 18 years with recurrent or 
progressive high-grade glioma because of efficacy concerns (see 5.1 for results of paediatric 
trials). 
[…] 
  5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties 
[…] 
Paediatric population 
[…] 
Anti-tumour activity was not observed in two studies among a total of 30 children aged > 3 
years old with relapsed or progressive high-grade glioma when treated with bevacizumab 
and irinotecan. There is insufficient information to determine the safety and efficacy of 
bevacizumab in children with newly-diagnosed high-grade glioma. 
In a single-arm study (PBTC-022), 18 children with recurrent or progressive non-pontine 
high-grade glioma (including 8 with glioblastoma [WHO grade IV], 9 with anaplastic 
astrocytoma [grade III] and 1 with anaplastic oligodendroglioma [grade III]) were treated 
with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) two weeks apart and then with bevacizumab in combination 
with CPT-11 (125-350 mg/m²) once every two weeks until progression. There were no 
objective (partial or complete) radiological responses (MacDonald criteria). Toxicity and 
adverse events included arterial hypertension and fatigue as well as CNS ischaemia with 
acute neurological deficit.    
In a retrospective single institution series, 12 consecutive (2005 to 2008) children with 
relapsed or progressive high-grade glioma (3 with WHO grade IV, 9 with grade III) were 
treated with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) and irinotecan (125 mg/m²) every 2 weeks. There 
were no complete responses and 2 partial responses (MacDonald criteria).

3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The  CHMP  concluded  that  the  update  of  section  5.1  of  the  SmPC  regarding  the  AVANT  study  is  not 
acceptable. 
In addition, the CHMP agreed with the inclusion of the results of the two paediatric studies under 
section 5.1 of the SmPC and the inclusion of the statement under section 4.2 in order to reflect the 
results from the paediatric studies. 
The CHMP considers that the benefit/risk balance of Avastin remains positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change:

include a statement that Avastin should not be used in children aged 3 years to less than 18 years with 
recurrent or progressive high-grade glioma. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the SmPC. 
In addition, the CHMP considers the following variation not acceptable and therefore does not 
recommend the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change:

Scope 
Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC with the results from two studies in children aged > 3 years old with 
relapsed or progressive high-grade glioma. In addition, section 4.2 of the SmPC has been updated to 
include a statement that Avastin should not be used in children aged 3 years to less than 18 years with 
recurrent or progressive high-grade glioma. 
Summary 
Based on the results from two paediatric studies, anti-tumour activity was not observed among a total 
of 30 children aged > 3 years old with relapsed or progressive high-grade glioma when treated with 
bevacizumab and irinotecan. There is insufficient information to determine the safety and efficacy of 
bevacizumab in children with newly-diagnosed high-grade glioma.  
More specifically, in a single-arm study (PBTC-022) there were no objective (partial or complete) 
radiological responses reported from 18 children with recurrent or progressive non-pontine high-grade 
glioma who were treated with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) in combination with CPT-11 (125-350 mg/m²). 
Toxicity and adverse events included arterial hypertension and fatigue as well as CNS ischaemia with 
acute neurological deficit.    
In addition, in a retrospective single institution series, no complete responses and two partial 
responses have been reported from 12 children with relapsed or progressive high-grade glioma who 
were treated with bevacizumab and irinotecan.  
The section 5.1 of the SmPC has been updated to include the above results and section 4.2 has been 
updated as well to include a statement that Avastin should not be used in children aged 3 years to less 
than 18 years with recurrent or progressive high-grade glioma.

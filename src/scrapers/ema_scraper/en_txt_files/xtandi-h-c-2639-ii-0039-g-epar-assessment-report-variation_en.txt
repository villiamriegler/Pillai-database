2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
This application is for extending the indication of enzalutamide to include treatment of adult men with 
non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (NM-CRPC) who are at high risk of developing 
metastatic disease (PSA doubling time ≤ 10 months and PSA levels ≥  2 ng/mL). 
Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is defined as prostate cancer that progresses despite 
castrate levels of testosterone while on treatment with a luteinizing-hormone releasing hormone 
analogue (LHRHa), or following bilateral orchiectomy. This disease was previously known as hormone-
refractory prostate cancer until research demonstrated that the majority of these resistant cancers 
overexpress the AR and may remain sensitive to more potent hormonal agents than those approved at 
the time (e,g., first generation antiandrogens such as flutamide or bicalutamide) [Chen et al, 2004]. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
In Europe (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom), it is estimated that NM-CRPC represents 
7% of all prostate cancer cases. The current prediction is that the 5-year prevalence will increase in 
the future from 89,810 patients in 2016 to 110,290 patients in 2026. 
In the United States (US), the incidence of NM-CRPC has been estimated to be 50,000 to 60,000 men 
per year, with a 34% annual rate of progression to metastatic CRPC (mCRPC), with rapidly rising PSA 
[ie, a PSA doubling time (PSADT) of ≤ 10 months] conferring greater risk. Of NM-CRPC patients, 33% 
developed bone metastasis within 2 years. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage 
Prostate cancer progresses through a series of characteristic clinical states that represent both the 
natural history of the disease and the response to treatment, as depicted in the below figure [Scher & 
Heller, 2000]. 
Assessment report  
EMA/41918/2019 
Page 7/90 
 
 
  
 
 
Following the initial evaluation and diagnosis of prostate cancer, approximately 90% of men undergo 
primary localized treatment with curative intent [Cooperberg et al, 2010].  Androgen deprivation 
therapy (ADT) (i.e., surgical or medical castration) is often initiated in men with rising prostate-specific 
antigen (PSA) after primary therapy.  Following ADT, the next most frequent clinical state in the 
current model of prostate cancer progression is that of CRPC, defined as disease progression despite 
castrate hormone levels (testosterone ≤ 50 ng/dL).  
Men with CRPC can have metastatic or non-metastatic disease, which has traditionally been 
determined by means of computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as well as 
radionuclide bone scans.  In the majority of patients, metastatic CRPC evolves from non-metastatic 
CRPC and PSA doubling time has been shown to be a strong predictor of the development of 
metastases in these patients.  Thus, PSA doubling time is reported as a useful prognostic factor in 
identifying patients at high-risk of development of clinically detectable metastatic disease (i.e., disease 
progression) [Moreira et al, 2015; Scher et al, 2015].  Various studies have assessed a range of PSA 
doubling times, with one study showing that a PSA doubling time of < 6 months was associated with 
an 11-fold higher risk of disease progression compared with a PSA doubling time of > 10 months 
[Nguyen et al, 2015]. 
2.1.5.  Management 
No therapy is currently approved for, nor has shown delay in, progression from non-metastatic to 
metastatic CRPC.  
Although high-risk non-metastatic CRPC (i.e., for patients with a short PSA doubling time) is a disease 
state, current treatment options are limited. Per a provisional opinion from the American Society of 
Clinical Oncology (ASCO), second-line hormonal therapy (e.g., antiandrogens, cytochrome P450 [CYP] 
17 inhibitors) may be considered in patients with nonmetastatic CRPC at high risk for metastatic 
disease (based on a short PSA doubling time or rapid velocity), but otherwise this treatment is not 
suggested [Virgo et al, 2017]. Similarly, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
guideline recommends first-generation antiandrogens (e.g., bicalutamide, nilutamide, flutamide), 
second-generation novel hormonal therapies (enzalutamide, abiraterone), ketoconazole, 
corticosteroids or diethylstilbestrol as second-line hormonal therapies [NCCN, 2017]. The European 
Society for Medical Oncology guidelines advise ADT and watchful waiting [Parker et al, 2015]. Thus, 
although continued use of ADT is part of clinical practice, no therapy is approved specifically for the 
treatment of patients with nonmetastatic CRPC.

About the product 
Enzalutamide (MDV3100) is a potent oral AR inhibitor that targets the androgen receptor (AR) 
signaling pathway.  Enzalutamide competitively inhibits androgen binding to the AR and, consequently, 
inhibits nuclear translocation of the AR and inhibits the association of the AR with DNA even in the 
setting of AR overexpression and in prostate cancer cells resistant to anti androgens. Enzalutamide 
treatment decreases the growth of prostate cancer cells and can induce cancer cell death and tumour 
regression. In preclinical studies enzalutamide lacks androgen receptor agonist activity.   
Enzalutamide is currently approved for the treatment of adult men with metastatic castration-resistant 
prostate cancer (CRPC) who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic after failure of androgen 
deprivation therapy in whom chemotherapy is not yet clinically indicated; and for the treatment of 
adult men with metastatic CRPC whose disease has progressed on or after docetaxel therapy. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This application seeks to broaden the current enzalutamide indication to include patients with non-
metastatic CRPC. 
The initially proposed wording was “the treatment of adult men with non-metastatic castration-
resistant prostate cancer”. 
The finally approved wording was “the treatment of adult men with high-risk non-metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer”. 
Xtandi is available in two pharmaceutical forms; capsule and tablet. The recommended dose is 160 mg 
enzalutamide as a single oral daily dose. This extension of indication covers both forms. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Nonclinical data for enzalutamide were previously included in the original marketing authorisation and 
variations to the marketing authorisation. Additional nonclinical studies have been submitted to 
support the current marketing application: 
•  An  in  vitro  plasma  protein  binding  in  nontransgenic  littermate  of  transgenic  rasH2  (non-Tg 
rasH2) mice and Wistar Hannover (WH) rats (Study 9785-ME-0045) submitted to support the 
calculation of free exposure. 
•  A carcinogenicity program was completed to support the approval of enzalutamide at an earlier 
stage in the prostate cancer disease process.  
o  A 26-week carcinogenicity study in Tg rasH2 mice (Study 9785-TX-0020). 
o  A 2-year carcinogenicity study in WH rats (Study 9785-TX-0017). 
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
No additional nonclinical pharmacology studies were submitted to support the current application (see 
non-clinical discussion).

2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Nonclinical pharmacokinetic data for enzalutamide (MDV3100), metabolite MDPC0001, a carboxylic 
acid derivative (M1) and metabolite MDPC0002, desmethyl-enzalutamide (M2) were included in the 
original marketing application and in the subsequent variation application related the chemotherapy-
naïve indication.   
In the original marketing application, the in vitro plasma protein binding of enzalutamide, M1 and M2 
was determined by equilibrium dialysis in plasma from mouse (CD1 [ICR]), rat (Sprague Dawley), 
rabbit, monkey and/or human. 
An additional study was performed with 14C-enzalutamide, 14C-M1 and 14C-M2 in order to determine 
the plasma protein binding of enzalutamide, M1 and M2 in non-transgenic littermate of transgenic 
rasH2 (non-Tg rasH2) mouse and Wistar Hanover (WH) rat plasma by equilibrium dialysis [Study 
9785-ME-0045]; the same mouse and rat strains used in the enzalutamide carcinogenicity studies.  
Plasma protein binding ratio of 14C-enzalutamide in non-Tg rasH2 mouse and WH rats ranged from 
96.8% to 97.7% and 95.0% to 95.9%, respectively. Respective plasma protein binding ratio of 14C-
M1 ranged from 92.6% to 92.9% and 96.5% to 96.9%. Respective plasma protein binding ratio of 
14C-M2 ranged from 93.8% to 94.0% and 91.0% to 91.5%. 
The in vitro plasma protein binding of enzalutamide was generally comparable in mouse (95% to 
98%), rat (94% to 96%), rabbit (88% to 90%), dog (94% to 96%) and human (97% to 98%) [Study 
PRO3100NC32 and Study 9785-ME-0045 combined]. The extent of binding was constant over a wide 
range of concentrations, 0.05 to 25 μg/mL for all species (0.5 to 25 μg/mL for female rabbits, non-Tg 
rasH2 mouse and WH rat plasma).

2.2.4.  Toxicology 
Carcinogenicity 
Study 9785-TX-0020 
Study 9785-TX-0020 is a 26-week definitive carcinogenicity study in Tg rasH2 mice (both sexes). 
In the preliminary 4-week DRF study in non-Tg rasH2 mice [Study 9785-TX-0019], enzalutamide 
related mortality at doses of 30 and 60 mg/kg per day occurred within the first week of dosing. There 
was no additional mortality at ≥  30 mg/kg per day during the remaining 3 weeks of the study. 
Decreased spontaneous movement, bradypnea and/or hypothermia were observed prior to mortality or 
when moribund animals were sacrificed. However, the cause of mortality or moribundity could not be 
established. Based on the findings in the DRF study, 20 mg/kg per day was used as the highest dose in 
Study 9785-TX-0020 in Tg rasH2 mice. The low (2 mg/kg/day) and mid (6 mg/kg/day) doses were 
selected to cover a wide range of clinical exposure margins and study dose response. 
Enzalutamide was administered by daily oral gavage to male and female Jic:CB6F1-Tg rasH2@Jcl mice 
(26 or 30 animals/sex per group, 8 weeks of age at the start of dosing) for 26 weeks, at dose levels of 
0 (negative control, water for injection), 0 (vehicle control, Labrasol), 2, 6 and 20 mg/kg per day as 
solution in Labrasol; dosing volume 10 mL/kg. Sixteen animals of each sex were included for the 
positive control group (N-methyl-N-nitrosourea [MNU] 75 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, once).  Systemic 
exposure (plasma concentrations) of enzalutamide and its metabolites (M1 and M2) was determined in 
satellite animals (non-Tg rasH2 mice) on day 1 and during week 26 of the dosing period, and 
toxicokinetic analysis was completed.  
At 20 mg/kg per day, there was mortality of 2 males on days 3 and 4, respectively, of the dosing 
period.  A potential cause for the mortality during the first few days of dosing could be lower food 
consumption, likely due to the unpalatable effect of Labrasol.  Similar mortalities were also observed 
during the first 4 days of the dosing period in the 4-week DRF study in non Tg rasH2 mice [Study 
9785-TX-0019].  In the DRF study, there was a transient body weight decrease (first 4 days of dosing) 
and reduced food consumption in all groups but mortalities only occurred at doses ≥  30 mg/kg per 
day up to day 7 of the dosing period.  To account for possible early mortalities in the definitive 26 
week study in Tg rasH2 mice, 30 mice per sex were initially assigned to the 20 mg/kg per day high 
dose group.  Following 2 weeks of dosing, 2 additional males (plus 2 mortalities) and 4 females were 
excluded from the 20 mg/kg per day dose group and the number of animals were adjusted to 26 mice 
per sex (similar to the other dose groups).  There was no additional mortality or adverse clinical signs 
during the remaining period of the study (24 weeks).  In the positive control group (MNU), there was 
mortality of all males and 11 of 16 females during the study duration, mainly due to neoplastic 
findings. The neoplastic findings are summarized in the table below.

Apart from the 2 initial mortalities, there were no enzalutamide-related clinical findings, visible 
palpable masses, body weight or food consumption changes in any dose group. All neoplastic findings 
were considered spontaneous, related to age and background. 
Histopathology revealed no enzalutamide-related neoplastic findings in either sex [table below].  In the 
positive control group, the Tg rasH2 mice demonstrated high sensitivity to MNU-induced neoplastic 
findings, which included a high incidence of malignant lymphoma and papilloma/carcinoma of the 
squamous cells in the forestomach. 
The non-neoplastic findings are summarized in the table below.

    † Negative control group (water for injection) 
    ‡Vehicle control group (Labrasol) 
Enzalutamide-related non-neoplastic findings (compared to vehicle) in both sexes included minimal to 
mild increase in hyalinosis of the gallbladder at doses ≥  6 mg/kg per day (adversity unknown) and 
minimal to mild eosinophilic change adrenal zona fasciculata at a dose of 20 mg/kg per day 
(nonadverse).  Although the hyalinosis was observed at low incidence in the Labrasol control group 
and at 2 mg/kg per day in females (indicative of a vehicle related change), the severity and incidence 
of the finding was exacerbated at ≥  6 mg/kg per day in both sexes.  There were no degenerative 
changes in gallbladder epithelium associated with the hyalinosis finding.  At ≥  6 mg/kg per day, 
findings in males only included minimal decrease in vacuolation of the Leydig cells in the testes 
(nonadverse) and at 20 mg/kg per day, additional findings in males included small size of prostate 
(without microscopic correlate) and small size seminal vesicle with correlated mild atrophy 
(nonadverse). Enzalutamide-related changes in the adrenal, testes, seminal vesicle and/or prostate 
were observed in previously reported toxicity studies in mice [Study 9785 TX 0019], rats [Studies 
PRO3100NC17; 9785 TX-0016] and dogs [Study 9785-TX-0010], and are consistent with its 
pharmacological activity (inhibition of the AR signaling). 
Other than hyalinosis in the gallbladder, Labrasol-related findings (compared to water control) included 
inflammation and/or regeneration in the bronchus and trachea, erosion/ulcer, inflammation and 
hyperplasia of the squamous cells in the forestomach corresponding to macroscopic lesions, 
hypertrophy in the centrilobular hepatocytes in the liver and minimal to mild hemorrhage in the 
Rathke’s cleft in the pituitary.  
Study 9785-TX-0017 
In this 2 year carcinogenicity study in rats (dose levels: 0, 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg per day), increased 
incidences of the following tumours were considered treatment-related in male Wistar Han (WH) rats: 
Leydig cell tumour in the testis (≥ 10 mg/kg per day); benign thymoma in the thymus (≥ 10 mg/kg per 
day); and urothelial papilloma/carcinoma in the urinary bladder, adenoma of pars distalis in the 
pituitary and fibroadenoma in the mammary gland (100 mg/kg per day). In female WH rats, 
treatment-related increases in adenoma of pars distalis in the pituitary (≥  30 mg/kg per day) and 
benign granulosa cell tumour in the ovary (100 mg/kg per day) were noted.

Toxicokinetic data 
Following oral administration, exposure (Cmax and AUC24h) of enzalutamide (parent) and its 
metabolites (M1 and M2) increased with increasing dose; there was no sex difference in exposure and 
accumulation was observed (parent and metabolites) following repeat administration for 26 weeks 
[Study 9785-TX-0020]. The exposure (Cmax and AUC24h) for enzalutamide was higher than those of 
the metabolites (M1 and M2); the exposures of M1 and M2 were similar. The tmax for enzalutamide 
ranged from 4 to 12 hours, and the tmax for metabolites ranged from 4 to 12 hours (see Table below).

metabolite M2 was 1.3 µg/mL and 23.6 µg•h/mL, respectively. At 20 mg/kg per day the exposure for 
enzalutamide in non-Tg rasH2 mice was similar to the clinical exposure in metastatic CRPC patients 
receiving 160 mg of enzalutamide, daily (Cmax, 16.6 µg/mL and AUC24h, 322 µg•h/mL), while the 
exposure of the active metabolite M2 in non-Tg rasH2 mice was from 0.08- to 0.11-fold of that in 
humans.

No new environmental risk assessment report of enzalutamide was submitted in support of the present 
extension of indication.

The MAH submitted the results of a new pharmacokinetic study assessing in vitro plasma protein 
binding of enzalutamide, metabolite MDPC0001, a carboxylic acid derivative (M1) and metabolite 
MDPC0002, desmethyl-enzalutamide (M2) in nontransgenic littermates of transgenic rasH2 mouse 
(non-Tg rasH2 mouse) and Wistar Hanover (WH) rat plasma (Study 9785-ME-0045). Overall, the 
plasma protein binding of enzalutamide and the metabolites M1 and M2 in nontransgenic littermates of 
Tg rasH2 mice and WH rats were comparable to the other rodent strains used in previously submitted 
toxicology studies. Plasma protein binding was also comparable between rodents and humans. 
With regards to carcinogenicity, the daily oral administration of enzalutamide for 26 weeks did not 
demonstrate any neoplastic findings, indicative of a lack of carcinogenic potential in the Tg rasH2 mice 
at a dose of ≤ 20 mg/kg per day. However, taking into account that the plasma exposure levels at 20 
mg/kg/day (348 µg.h/mL and 286 µg.h/mL, in females and males respectively) were similar to the 
clinical exposure in metastatic CRPC patients receiving 160 mg/kg/day (322 µg.h/mL) and, the 
AUC24h for M1 and M2 ranged from 0.08 to 0.21-fold of those in humans, the carcinogenicity potential 
of enzalutamide cannot be discarded.  
In line with ICH S1A guideline, the MAH was requested to submit the final study report of the 2-year 
pivotal study (both sexes) in Wistar Han (WH) rats during the procedure. In this study increased 
incidences of the following tumours were considered treatment-related in male WH rats: Leydig cell 
tumour in the testis; benign thymoma in the thymus; and urothelial papilloma/carcinoma in the 
urinary bladder, adenoma of pars distalis in the pituitary and fibroadenoma in the mammary gland. In 
female WH rats, treatment-related increases in adenoma of pars distalis in the pituitary and benign 
granulosa cell tumour in the ovary were noted. Except for the urinary bladder, these tumours were 
observed in organs that are regulated via the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal hormone axis and 
considered to be related to the pharmacological activity of enzalutamide. Leydig cell tumours in rats 
are generally accepted as not relevant to humans [Cook et al, 1999]. The tumours observed in organs 
that are regulated via the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal hormone axis, induced by non-genotoxic 
compounds, most likely have low relevance to humans under most exposure conditions because 
humans are quantitatively less sensitive that rats [Cook et al., 2015]. 
Urothelial papilloma/carcinoma in the urinary bladder is thought to be induced by continuous local 
irritation of the epithelium by crystals or calculi that consist of excreted carboxylic acid metabolite. 
Calculi and crystals were observed in rat urinary bladders. However, no obvious mechanistic rationale 
to explain specifically this malignancy can be established. At 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg per day, the 
exposure multiples of enzalutamide in male rats were 0.28-, 0.76- and 1.4-fold, respectively, of the 
exposure in humans taking enzalutamide 160 mg/day, while those of the inactive carboxylic acid 
metabolite were 0.17-, 0.44- and 1.7-fold, respectively. At all dose levels, the exposure multiple of the 
active metabolite, N-desmethyl enzalutamide, in male rats was less than 0.12-fold. In conclusion, 
taking into account that exposure levels, based on AUC, achieved in the study, for enzalutamide plus 
its metabolite M2, were less than or similar to those in prostate cancer patients at the recommended 
dose of 160 mg/day (322 µg.h/mL), urinary bladder carcinogenicity potential of enzalutamide in 
human cannot be excluded (see section 5.3 of the SmPC). 
An updated environrmental risk assessement has not been submitted with the applied extension of 
indication since the environmental risk assessment provided in the initial marketing authorisation was 
based in the prevalence of all castration-resistant prostate cancer (including non-metastatic CRPC 
patients after failure of ADT), and the PECsurfacewater used was calculated using a refined Fpen based 
on the prevalence of all CRPC. In addition, as part of the post approval commitments after the 
approval of Xtandi in 2013, a full Phase I and II environmental risk assessment program for 
enzalutamide was completed, which included a fish sexual development test (OECD 234) to evaluate 
potential endocrine disruptive properties. The results concluded that the placement of enzalutamide on 
Assessment report

the European market constitutes no risk for the environment, including surface waters, groundwater, 
sediments, and terrestrial compartments or to micro-organisms (procedure nr: 
EMEA/H/C/002639/IB/0032, doc reference: EMA/CHMP/494205/2016). Therefore, additional studies 
are not required to support the new extension of indication. 
2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical package is considered adequate to support this application to extend the 
indication to patients with non-metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. Relevant information 
has been included in the SmPC (see SmPC section 5.3).

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study 
MDV3100 14 (PROSPER) 
This was a phase 3, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled in patients with nonmetastatic CRPC. 
Figure 1. MDV3100-14 Study Schematic 
Patients were screened and randomized 2:1 to enzalutamide or placebo on day 1. While on study drug, 
patients returned to the study site at weeks 5 and 17 and every 16 weeks thereafter. At week 5, 
general activities included brief physical examination, assessment of ECOG performance status, 
adverse events, and concomitant medications reviews, and drug accountability. At week 17 and every 
16 weeks thereafter until treatment discontinuation, general activities included radiographic 
assessments, completion of quality of life questionnaires, study drug dispensing, and central laboratory 
evaluations (hematology, serum chemistry, and PSA) in addition to the activities performed at week 5.  
Safety follow-up after permanent treatment discontinuation occurred approximately 30 days after the 
last dose of study drug or occurred immediately before starting a new antineoplastic treatment if 
before 30 days after the last dose of study drug. 
Methods 
Study participants 
Eligibility criteria were chosen to include patients with non-metastatic CRPC who progressed on ADT 
and were at high risk of developing metastases determined by increasing PSA levels as well as a PSA 
doubling time ≤ 10 months at screening.   
Assessment report  
EMA/41918/2019 
Page 18/90 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Inclusion criteria 
•  Asymptomatic histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate 
•  Ongoing ADT with a LHRH agonist/antagonist or prior bilateral orchiectomy 
•  Serum testosterone level ≤  50 ng/dL (1.73 nmol/L) at screening 
• 
• 
PSA doubling time ≤  10 months at screening 
Progressive disease at study entry while on primary ADT based on rising PSA levels ≥  2 ng/mL 
•  No prior or present evidence of metastatic disease 
• 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 
Exclusion criteria 
• 
• 
• 
Prior use of cytotoxic chemotherapy for prostate cancer 
Participation in a clinical study of an investigational agent that inhibits the AR or androgen 
synthesis (unless treatment was placebo) 
Prior treatment with hormonal therapy or biologic therapy for prostate cancer, or an investigational 
agent within 4 weeks before randomization 
Treatments 
The study drugs included enzalutamide and placebo. The daily dose of enzalutamide/placebo was 160 
mg/day given orally in 4 capsules (40 mg each). Dose reduction to 120 or 80 mg/day was allowed.  
Patients self-administered blinded study drug orally once daily, with or without food, starting on Day 1. 
The capsules were swallowed whole without chewing, dissolving, or opening them. 
Patients who experienced a Grade 3 or higher toxicity that was attributed to study drug and could not 
be ameliorated by the use of adequate medical intervention, may have interrupted treatment with 
blinded study drug for 1 week or until the toxicity grade improved to Grade 2 or lower severity. 
Subsequently, blinded study drug dosing could be restarted at the original dose (160 mg/day) or a 
reduced dose (120 or 80 mg/day) in consultation with the medical monitor. 
If blinded study drug was coadministered with a strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 inhibitor, the dose 
of blinded study drug was reduced to 80 mg once daily. If coadministration of the strong CYP2C8 
inhibitor was discontinued, the blinded study drug dose was returned to the dose used prior to 
initiation of the strong CYP2C8 inhibitor. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to determine the efficacy of enzalutamide compared with 
placebo by BICR-assessed MFS.  
Key secondary objectives of the study were to evaluate the benefit of enzalutamide compared with 
placebo as measured by time to PSA progression, time to first use of new antineoplastic therapy, and 
OS.  Other secondary objectives were to compare time to pain progression; time to first use of 
cytotoxic chemotherapy; chemotherapy-free disease-specific survival; chemotherapy-free survival; 
PSA response rates; QoL assessed by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – Prostate (FACT P) 
questionnaire, EQ-5D 5 Dimensions health questionnaire, and  (EQ-5D-5L) and Quality of Life 
Questionnaire Prostate 25 module (QLQ PR25 module); and to evaluate safety between the 
enzalutamide group and the placebo group.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was BICR-assessed MFS defined as the time from randomization to 
radiographic progression, or death within 112 days of treatment discontinuation without evidence of 
radiographic progression whichever occurred first. 
All study films were read locally at the study site and submitted to the central imaging unit for BICR. 
Each study site designated a radiologist or investigator as the primary imaging reviewer to ensure that 
all images were read consistently as specified by the protocol. 
Table 2. Assessment of Radiographic Progression 
Key secondary endpoints included time to PSA progression (time to a 25% or greater increase and an 
absolute increase of 2 ng/mL), time to first use of new antineoplastic therapy, and Overall Survival. 
Additional secondary endpoints included time to pain progression using the BPI-SF; time to first use of 
cytotoxic chemotherapy; chemotherapy-free disease-specific survival, defined as the time from 
randomization to the first use of cytotoxic chemotherapy for prostate cancer or death due to prostate 
cancer as assessed by the investigator; chemotherapy-free survival, defined as the time from 
randomization to the first use of cytotoxic chemotherapy for prostate cancer or death due to any 
cause; PSA response rate defined as a reduction in PSA of ≥ 50% or ≥ 90% from baseline, or a decline 
to undetectable levels from baseline; and QoL assessed by FACT-P (additionally for EQ-5D-5L 
questionnaires and the EORTC QLQ-PR25 module – data not shown). 
Sample size 
The following assumptions were used in determining the sample size calculation for the MFS endpoint: 
•  2:1 enzalutamide to placebo treatment allocation; 
•  An increasing nonuniform accrual of 0.25 patients per month per site with maximum accrual of 
63 patients per month; 
• 
For MFS, a target hazard ratio of 0.72 at a 2-sided significance level of 5% with 90% power. 
Under an exponential model assumption, the target difference in Kaplan-Meier estimated 
medians was 9 months (control median of 24 months versus treatment median of 33 months). 
The median MFS of 24 months for the placebo group was based on published data (Nelson et 
al, 2009).

A total of 440 MFS events provided 90% power to detect a target hazard ratio of 0.72 based on a 2-
sided log-rank test and the overall significance level of 0.05. A sample size of approximately 1305 
patients (870 enzalutamide and 435 placebo) was expected to achieve 440 events in approximately 43 
months.  
Approximately 10% of patients enrolled were expected to be lost to follow-up, found to have 
metastatic disease at study entry, or have events censored due to required analytical methods, so 
approximately 1440 patients (960 enzalutamide and 480 placebo) were targeted to be randomized. 
The time from date of first randomization until 440 MFS events were observed was estimated to be 
approximately 43 months. 
Approximately  500  PSA  progression  events  were  expected  at  the  time  of  the  single  MFS  analysis. 
Based  on  a  HR  assumption  of  0.60,  this  endpoint  had  >95%  power  at  a  2-sided  significance  level  of 
0.02 
Approximately  360  new  antineoplastic  therapy  events  were  expected  at  the  time  of  the  single  MFS 
analysis. This endpoint had 80% power to detect a HR of 0.70 at a 2-sided significance level of 0.02. 
At the final analysis of OS (after 3 interim analyses), 590 death events are required to have 85% 
power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.77 at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. Under an exponential 
model assumption, the target difference in Kaplan-Meier estimated medians was expected to be 13.7 
months (46 months placebo vs. 59.7 months enzalutamide). 
Randomisation 
Central randomization to enzalutamide or placebo treatments (2:1) was stratified by the following 
factors: 
• 
PSA DT (<6 months versus ≥ 6 months) 
•  Baseline use of a BTA (yes versus no) 
Blinding (masking) 
This study was blinded and placebo-controlled. All patients, study site personnel (including 
investigators), and Sponsor staff and its representatives were blinded to treatment assignment. 
The blinded control for this study was placebo capsules (placebo) identical in appearance to the 
enzalutamide capsules. 
Statistical methods 
The primary analysis population for efficacy was the ITT population, defined as all patients randomly 
assigned to study treatment, and was based on randomized treatment assignment regardless of 
whether or not the assigned treatment was administered. 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis: MFS 
MFS analyses were performed using a stratified log-rank test to compare the 2 treatment groups using 
a 2-sided test at a 0.05 level of significance; stratification factors were PSA doubling time and prior or 
current bone-targeting agent.  
Sensitivity analyses were conducted using modified censoring/event rules. These prespecified 
sensitivity analyses included the following: a modified MFS analysis defined in which disease 
progression after initiation of any prostate cancer treatment also counted as an event; a modified MFS 
analysis in which any death, including any posttreatment death, was considered as an event; a 
modified MFS analysis to assess the sensitivity of MFS to antineoplastic therapy; MFS based on the

investigator assessment; and assessment of the impact of clinical deterioration, defined as permanent 
discontinuation due to an adverse event (AE), defined by the investigator, prior to protocol-defined 
evidence of radiographic progression. 
Table 3. Censoring Rules 
Assessment report  
EMA/41918/2019 
Page 22/90 
 
 
  
 
 
Prespecified subgroup assessments included the following: PSA doubling time; baseline use of a bone-
targeting agent; baseline age; baseline ECOG performance status; geographic region; total Gleason 
score at diagnosis; and PSA, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and hemoglobin levels at baseline.  
Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Analyses 
The primary MFS endpoint was tested at a 0.05 significance level.  To maintain the family-wise 2 sided 
type I error rate at 0.05, if MFS was statistically significant, a parallel testing strategy was used to test 
OS with allocated type I error rate 0.03 and the remaining key secondary endpoints (time to PSA 
progression and time to first use of new antineoplastic therapy) with allocated type I error rate 0.02. 
Time to PSA progression and time to first use of new antineoplastic therapy were tested using a 
sequential approach, and if both were statistically significant, then the 0.02 alpha was reallocated to 
OS to allow for OS to be tested at the 0.05 significance level.

The hazard ratio was estimated using a stratified Cox regression model with the same strata as above.  
Additional Secondary Endpoint Analyses 
A stratified log-rank test was used to compare the 2 treatment groups for time to pain progression, 
time to first use of cytotoxic chemotherapy, chemotherapy-free disease-specific survival, and 
chemotherapy-free survival. 
PSA response rate defined as a reduction in PSA of ≥  50% or ≥ 90% from baseline or decline to 
undetectable levels from baseline were each compared between the 2 treatment groups using a 
stratified Cochran-Masntel-Haenszel mean score test. 
All QoL assessment data were summarized descriptively by study visit.

Recruitment 
Between 26 November 2013 and 28 June 2017, 1401 patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to 
treatment with enzalutamide (933 patients) or placebo (468 patients); 1395 patients received at least

1 dose or partial dose of enzalutamide (930 patients) or placebo (465 patients). A total of 254 study 
sites in 32 countries in North and South America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Asia 
randomized patients in this study. The highest enrolling countries were Australia (136 patients, 9.7%), 
US (105 patients, 7.5%), Brazil (104 patients, 7.4%), France (103 patients, 7.4%), and Canada (99 
patients, 7.1%). Enrollment by site ranged from 1 to 40 patients. 
Table 6. Enrollment by Region (ITT Population) 
Conduct of the study 
The original study protocol was dated 29 March 2013. There were 3 protocol amendments, which 
became effective during the study and affected the conduct of the study or planned analyses. 
The original statistical analysis plan (SAP), dated 29 March 2013, was amended three times on 16 May 
2013 (Version 2), 31 May 2017 (Version 3), and 10 August 2017 (Version 4) to reflect the changes 
implemented due to the protocol amendments. The main changes in the planned analyses were based 
on changes made to the protocol, including the timing and plan for the analyses of the primary 
endpoint of MFS, as well as the secondary endpoints. 
A total of 78 patients (5.6%) (54 [5.8%] in the enzalutamide group and 24 [5.1%] in the placebo 
group) had 1 or more major protocol deviations during the study, defined as deviations of eligibility 
criteria not met, receiving excluded concomitant medication, receiving the wrong treatment, not 
receiving required concomitant medication, not discontinuing per the protocol (ie, developed criteria 
for discontinuation of study drug but did not discontinue study treatment), receiving an incorrect dose, 
or procedures performed before consent (ie, did not sign informed consent or study-specific 
procedures were performed before informed consent was signed).

Numbers analysed 
The final analysis was conducted with 447 MFS events. The data cutoff date for the final analysis was 
28 Jun 2017. A total of 1401 patients were randomized between 26 Nov 2013 and 28 Jun 2017 to 
receive treatment (933 enzalutamide and 468 placebo) and were included in the ITT population. A 
total of 1395 (99.6%) patients received at least 1 dose of enzalutamide (930 [99.7%] patients) or 
placebo (465 [99.4%] patients) and were included in the safety population. 
A total of 810 (57.8%) patients (634 [68.0%] enzalutamide; 176 [37.6%] placebo) remained on study 
drug as of the data cutoff date.

§ Based on the Prostate-specific Antigen Progression compliant with Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 criteria.  For 
patients with PSA declines at week 17, the PSA progression date was defined as the date that a ≥  25% increase and an absolute 
increase of ≥  2 ng/mL above the nadir was documented, which was confirmed by a second consecutive value obtained at least 3 
weeks later.  For patients without PSA decline at week 17, the PSA progression date was defined as the date that a ≥  25% increase 
and an absolute increase of ≥  2 ng/mL above baseline was documented, which was confirmed by a second consecutive value at 
least 3 weeks later.  PSA progression could only have been declared on or after the week 17 assessment.

Enzalutamide demonstrated a statistically significant 70.8% reduction in the relative risk of an MFS 
event compared with placebo (HR: 0.292; 95% CI: 0.241, 0.352; 2 sided stratified log-rank test P < 
0.0001).  The median time to an MFS event was 36.6 months (95% CI: 33.1, not reached) in the 
enzalutamide group vs 14.7 months (95% CI: 14.2, 15.0) in the placebo group, a difference of 21.9 
months.  Most of the patients (76.5%) in the enzalutamide treatment group were censored.  A total of 
219 (23.5%) patients in the enzalutamide group and 228 (48.7%) patients in the placebo group had 
BICR-assessed MFS events (447 total MFS events). Of the MFS events, soft-tissue disease progression 
alone (11.7% enzalutamide and 28.2% placebo) was more common than bone progression alone 
(7.6% enzalutamide and 16.9% placebo) or concurrent bone and soft-tissue progression (0.8% 
enzalutamide and 2.8% placebo).  A total of 32 (3.4%) patients in the enzalutamide group and 4 
patients (0.9%) in the placebo group had an MFS event of death on study without documented 
radiographic progression, and 76.5% of patients in the enzalutamide group and 51.3% of patients in 
the placebo group were censored. A small proportion of patients in both treatment groups (2.5% 
enzalutamide vs 3.0% placebo) were censored because patients were randomized but later confirmed 
by BICR assessment to have metastatic disease before randomization.

Ad-hoc analysis of MFS 
To further understand the effects of enzalutamide treatment on the development of different types of 
metastases, an ad hoc analysis of MFS (time to radiographic progression or death) by progression type 
was conducted to evaluate bone-specific MFS (bMFS) and soft tissue-specific MFS (sMFS). This ad hoc 
analysis showed a significant benefit in favour of enzalutamide for both bMFS (HR: 0.35, 95% CI: 
0.27, 0.46, P < 0.0001) and sMFS (HR: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.25, 0.38, P < 0.0001).

The differences in response rates between the enzalutamide and placebo groups for confirmed PSA 
responses 50% reduction, 90% reduction, and decrease to undetectable levels from baseline were 
statistically significant (p-values<0.0001 in all rates). The differences in response rates were 73.96% 
[95% CI: 70.91%-77.02%], 55.52% [95% CI: 52.28%-58.76%], and 9.65% [95% CI: 7.75%-

Treatment with enzalutamide did not show a significant difference in quality of life compared with 
placebo as measured by the time to degradation of the FACT-P global score, with a HR of 0.922 [95% 
CI: 0.787, 1.080]; p-value=0.3128. The median (95% CI) time to degradation of FACT-P was 11.1 
months (11.0, 14.7) in the enzalutamide group and similarly 11.1 months (11.0, 12.5) in the placebo 
group.

All patients randomly assigned to study treatment and based on randomized treatment assignment regardless of 
whether or not treatment was administered (ITT Population).   
The analysis data cutoff date was 28 Jun 2017.   
P value was based on a stratified log-rank test by PSA doubling time (< 6 months, ≥ 6 months) and prior or 
concurrent use of a bone targeting agent (yes, no) as per IXRS.  The HR was based on a Cox regression model 
(with treatment as the only covariate) stratified by the factors defined above and was relative to placebo with < 1 
favoring enzalutamide.

Supportive study 
Study MDV3100-09 (STRIVE) 
Study MDV3100 09 was a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, efficacy and safety study of 
enzalutamide (160 mg/day) vs bicalutamide (50 mg/day) in patients with nonmetastatic or metastatic 
CRPC.  The study enrolled 396 patients (198 enzalutamide and 198 bicalutamide) at 62 sites in the US. 
The primary objective of the study was to determine the benefit of enzalutamide compared with 
bicalutamide by investigator-assessed PFS. The secondary objectives were to determine the benefit of 
enzalutamide compared with bicalutamide as assessed by time to PSA progression, PSA response, 
rPFS, objective response rate (metastatic subgroup only) and QoL as assessed by FACT-P; and to 
determine the safety of enzalutamide compared with bicalutamide

Eligible patients were randomly assigned in blinded fashion to receive either enzalutamide or 
bicalutamide in a 1:1 ratio by central randomization and stratified by disease stage as follows: 
•  No distant metastasis and no regional nodal metastasis 
•  No distant metastasis, but presence of regional nodal metastasis, defined as involvement of 
nodes below the aortic bifurcation 
• 
Presence of distant metastasis (could include nodal involvement above the aortic bifurcation) 
Patients without a prior bilateral orchiectomy continued to receive ADT with an LHRH analogue in the 
absence of intolerable drug related toxicity.  Patients were permitted to continue study drug upon 
disease progression (defined by PSA or radiographic progression) unless they started cytotoxic 
chemotherapy, new investigational therapy, or an AR inhibitor. 
After the first 29 patients were enrolled, the protocol was amended to remove the requirement of a 
history of definitive localized therapy and to exclude the use of systemic corticosteroids for the 
treatment of prostate cancer. After the study was unblinded, the protocol was amended to include an 
open label treatment period as an option for patients on study drug at the time of unblinding and 
(upon successful screening) for those patients who discontinued bicalutamide before unblinding.  This 
open-label extension study is ongoing. 
A safety follow-up visit occurred 30 days after the last dose or prior to initiation of a subsequent 
cytotoxic or investigational therapy, whichever occurred first.

The positive effect of enzalutamide treatment was shown in both the overall ITT population and the

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Enzalutamide is currently approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic CRPC (pre and post 
chemotherapy). The MAH is seeking a broad indication in the treatment of patients with CRPC for 
which has submitted the results of two clinical studies: a pivotal, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, phase 3 Study MDV3100-14 (PROSPER) conducted in patients with nonmetastatic CRPC, 
together with supporting data from the nonmetastatic disease subgroup of the randomized, double-
blind, bicalutamide-controlled, phase 2 study MDV3100-09 (STRIVE). 
Focusing on the main study, the inclusion/exclusion criteria allowed the inclusion of patients on 
treatment with androgen deprivation therapy with a GnRH agonist/antagonist or prior bilateral 
orchiectomy, but castration resistant in terms of PSA progression (M0CRPC) at high risk as defined by 
PSADT < 10 months. Precisely, the definition of this high risk population seems to be the reason for 
treating with enzalutamide, given the higher risk of developing metastases and eventually the potential 
impact in both, OS and QoL. Therefore, a more precise definition of patients to be treated with 
enzalutamide has been included in the section 4.1 of the SmPC. 
MFS was chosen as primary endpoint. From a patient perspective, and clinical view, the use of this 
variable is acknowledged (see also SAG discussion). The fact of being able to delay the onset of 
metastases represents a valuable objective. Nonetheless, given that the vast majority of these 
metastases in prostate cancer are asymptomatic, other variables should be kept in mind. Indeed, the 
fact of delaying the onset of metastasis has not been linked with an increase in OS. As a consequence, 
besides time to PSA progression and time to first use of new antineoplastic therapy, OS along with 
time to pain progression and time to first use of cytotoxic chemotherapy, were also included. 
The methods to analyse the primary and secondary endpoints seem, overall, acceptable. The company 
has partially followed the CHMP’s SA in relation to the primary endpoint. BICR assessment was 
recommended.  
The sample size calculation and assumptions were not very challenging, with an expected HR of 0.72. 
Of note, the study was powered to find differences in time to PSA progression and OS. 
The blind design of the study, even supported, could pose challenges, taking into account the 
comparator arm and the PSA progression. Nevertheless, as the primary endpoint was evaluated by a 
BICR, this was accepted. 
Stratification factors are also agreed, although a region stratum should have been included. In this 
regard, is reassuring that the subgroups analysis on MFS did not show important differences according 
to regions.  
The phase 2 supportive study (STRIVE) was designed in a different population, with metastatic and no 
metastatic patients, with bicalutamide as comparator. Despite that disease stage was a stratification 
factor, the value of this study is clearly limited, since the prognosis in the subset of M0 seemed better 
than in the pivotal trial (few patients in high risk of developing metastasis).  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the PROSPER trial, a total of 254 study sites in 32 countries in North and South America, Europe, 
Australia, New Zealand, and Asia randomized patients. The highest enrolling countries were Australia 
(136 patients, 9.7%), US (105 patients, 7.5%), Brazil (104 patients, 7.4%), France (103 patients, 
Assessment report  
EMA/41918/2019 
Page 49/90 
 
 
  
 
7.4%), and Canada (99 patients, 7.1%). Subgroups analysis according to geographic region did not 
reveal any important differences. 
The participant flow does no show important concerns and the majority of patients on treatment at the 
date of the data cutoff, belong to the enzalutamide arm (68% vs 38%). Approximately half of the 
patients at screening were not randomized. 
The study was amended three times. The most important consequence of these amendments was the 
disconnection between the final MFS and final OS. This change was apparently driven by the results 
from the study MDV3100-09 (STRIVE study) along with studies MDV3100-03 and 9785-CL-0222. 
Better outcomes than expected from these ones related to MFS, led the MAH to decouple OS and MFS. 
A total of 78 patients (5.6%) (54 [5.8%] in the enzalutamide group and 24 [5.1%] in the placebo 
group) had 1 or more major protocol deviations during the study. However, percentages of major 
protocol deviations seem to be evenly balanced between arms and no important biases have been 
identified. 
The baseline characteristics point out that the majority of patients had a baseline ECOG performance 
status 0 (80.6%) and PSA DT <6 months (76.8%). The median PSA DT was 3.7 months (range: 0.4 to 
71.8 months) across treatment groups. More than half of patients had previously received 2 or more 
prior hormonal therapies in addition to their primary treatment for prostate cancer prior to study entry. 
The median age at randomization was 74.0 years in the enzalutamide group and 73.0 years in the 
placebo group. Despite the inclusion criteria, 2.6% of patients were considered metastatic. However, 
these patients were censored at randomization in the primary MFS analysis and its sensitivity analyses. 
In any case, due to the small number, no great impact is expected on the results. 
Results from PROSPER trial in the efficacy target population of patients at the cut-off date of 28-June-
2016 included the main analysis planned for MFS (BIRC assessed) and the first interim analysis for OS 
(2 IA planned plus 1 final analysis). 
With an event rate of 23.5% and 48.7% for enzalutamide and placebo arms respectively, a statistically 
significant improvement in MFS was observed for enzalutamide compared to placebo (HR: 0.292; 95% 
CI: 0.241, 0.352). The median MFS (95% CI) was 36.6 months (95% CI: 33.1, NR) in the 
enzalutamide group and 14.7 months (95% CI: 14.2, 15.0) in the placebo group (Δ 21.9 months). A 
reduction in both bone metastases and soft tissue metastases was observed among patients treated 
with enzalutamide compared to placebo. These results are supported by several sensitivity analyses as 
well as by subgroups analyses. 
Overall, key secondary endpoints showed consistency with primary efficacy outcomes. Treatment with 
enzalutamide delayed time to PSA progression (HR=0.066; 95% CI: 0.054, 0.081) and time to first 
use of new antineoplastic treatment (HR:0.208; 95% CI: 0.168, 0.258). OS data, still highly immature 
at the time of the first IA so as to draw any firm conclusion (event rate 11% and 13.2% in 
enzalutamide and placebo arms respectively), did not cross the boundary for statistical significance 
(HR=0.795, 95% CI: 0.580, 1.089) and no clear separation of the survival curves is observed, 
however there is no indication of a detrimental effect, which is reassuring. This remains to be further 
confirmed (see efficacy conclusions). 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints included to provide additional evidence of clinical benefit (need for 
First Use of Cytotoxic Chemotherapy, Chemotherapy-Free Disease-Specific Survival, Chemotherapy-
Free Survival) though still rather immature in some cases, all supported primary efficacy results but 
time to pain progression (HR=0.959; 95% CI: 0.801, 0.1.149), the latter maybe due to the fact that 
patients were nonmetastatic at study entry, and therefore were without pain from prostate cancer, and 
collection of the BPI-SF was discontinued at the time of radiographic progression.

Enzalutamide has shown both in the pre-chemotherapy mildly symptomatic setting and in post-
chemotherapy stage to increase the life expectancy. However, this longer survival has not been shown 
yet in the new setting of M0 CRPC (updated OS are expected). The delay in the onset of metastases 
does represent a benefit from an individual patient perspective, which is accompanied by a PSA 
response (see SAG discussion). A direct consequence of these effects is to postpone the use of 
antineoplastic treatment, which will likely mean to postpone the introduction of new hormonal 
therapies (e.g. abiraterone) and to a lesser extent the use of docetaxel. In fact, the most common 
postbaseline antineoplastic therapy was endocrine therapy (18.0% enzalutamide and 39.8% placebo), 
of which abiraterone was the most common generic name medication (7.0% and 27.7%), followed by 
leuprorelin (5.3% enzalutamide and 4.5% placebo) and bicalutamide (1.6% enzalutamide and 6.2% 
placebo). Docetaxel was used by 7.7% vs 20.2% (enzalutamide arms vs placebo respectively). Due to 
the blinding rules, the treatment for the study participants was blinded until cut-off date, June 2017. 
Enzalutamide was approved for patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic CRPC 
since October 2014. This means that patients in the control arm did not receive enzulatmide after 
progression, which would have been more in line with current standards. The pivotal trial does not 
allow establishing if enzalutamide given before or after progression provides greatest benefit to 
patients (see below). 
Splitting the cause of death between disease progression and other causes, showed that a higher 
percentage of deaths on the placebo group were to disease progression as judged by investigators, 
16.7%, as compared to 11.1% in the enzalutamide group. However, the percentage of deaths due to 
other causes was higher in the enzalutamide group, 8.6%, compared to 5.6% in the placebo group. 
These differences in deaths due to other causes could be a consequence of the fact that since patients 
receiving enzalutamide had fewer deaths due to prostate cancer, the likelihood of dying of other 
causes and comorbidities was higher. However, these analyses are marred by competing risks and can 
be considered, at best, hypothesis generating. Further long-term efficacy data are expected in order to 
shed light on that (see efficacy conlcusions). 
Treatment with enzalutamide did not show a significant difference in quality of life. 
Earlier use of hormonal therapies could impede their efficacy in the metastatic setting, which would 
pose uncertainties about the right sequence and the consequence of that in terms of mechanism of 
resistance. PFS2 could partially answer this question, although not included in the design of the 
PROSPER study. References submitted (Bono et at, 2017 and SPARTAN study) to resolve this issue did 
not provide enough evidence. Additionally, the present study was not designed to unravel uncertainties 
about the best possible sequence for enzalutamide treatment. Neither was the study to show the 
benefit of early versus deferred therapy, i.e. to initiate therapy at the non-metastatic stage versus at 
time of metastases. Consequently, this cannot be considered clarified with available data. The relative 
benefit of early versus late use of enzalutamide remains unknown. 
Additional expert consultation 
A SAG-O meeting was held on September the 6th. 
The SAG oncology was invited to provide its opinion on the following points: 
1. Do you consider that presently available data are sufficient to demonstrate the clinical 
benefit of Xtandi in the sought indication, given the absence of documented symptomatic 
benefit and absence of mature overall survival results? 
The effect of enzalutamide in the sought indication is of clear statistical significance. Such an effect is 
also clinically significant because it is reasonable to assume that postponing the onset of metastasis by 
21.9 months (the observed difference in median metastasis-free survival, MFS, between the 
Assessment report  
EMA/41918/2019 
Page 51/90 
 
 
  
experimental and control arm in the pivotal trial) is associated with a delaying of symptoms and 
worsening of quality of life, and delaying the need for subsequent treatments in the metastatic settings 
(and associated anxiety in view of the worse prognosis and likely higher toxicity). The results in terms 
of MFS are corroborated by a trend showing a favourable effect on overall survival (OS), other 
secondary endpoints, and the effect of enzalutamide in the metastatic setting. The effect of 
enzalutamide has been consistent across endpoints and stages of the disease in different randomized 
trials. MFS has been validated as a surrogate endpoint for overall survival in an earlier setting (Xie et 
al. 2017), which is supportive evidence even acknowledging the different settings and results of the 
pivotal trial (i.e., the relatively small difference in OS compared to MFS). The toxicity associated with 
enzalutamide (Grade >3 AEs: 31.4% v. 23.4% for enzalutamide v. placebo, respectively) did not raise 
particular concerns, as also shown by the low rate of treatment discontinuation (<10% due to 
toxicity). No significant detriment was observed in quality of life compared to placebo. Thus, the SAG 
concluded that the clinical benefit has been established based on reasonable assumptions and 
supportive evidence. This clinical benefit was confirmed from a patient perspective. 
However, some SAG members took issue with the lack of a demonstrated effect in terms of quality of 
life or OS, the lack of long-term follow-up data (including patient-reported outcomes after progression 
and the objective effects after censoring for the primary endpoint MFS; e.g. PFS 2 like data (response 
and duration of such therapies). In addition, it would have been of value to have long-term follow-up 
data on this earlier introduction of enzalutamide in the sequence of currently available treatments. 
Without having studied the optimal sequence in terms of long-term outcomes leaves a number of 
uncertainties that make clinical decisions difficult. Although the trend in OS appeared reassuring, 
further studies would have to determine the clinical usefulness of enzalutamide before v. after 
evidence of metastasis and symptomatic disease, as well as how early treatment with enzalutamide in 
the non-metastatic setting fits in the sequence with other agents used in clinical practice according to 
today’s standards. Thus, long-term follow-up at regular interval should be mandated post-approval and 
further studies are needed to determine optimal sequencing of available treatments. Until further data 
are available, the value of enzalutamide prior to onset of metastases will be difficult to establish. 
2. What is the clinical relevance of a gain in the metastasis-free-survival per se in the 
setting of non-metastatic CRPC? 
MFS is assumed to be associated with a delaying of symptoms and worsening of quality of life, and 
deferring the need for subsequent treatments in the metastatic settings (and associated anxiety in 
view of the worse prognosis and likely higher toxicity). All these assumptions are considered quite 
reasonable given the natural history of the disease, the available therapeutic options in the metastatic 
setting, and the available supportive data (see answer to question No. 1). In the absence of 
detrimental toxicity or marked decrease in quality of life due to treatment before development of 
metastases, delaying metastatic disease can be a valid objective of therapy, shared by both patients 
and physicians. 
These assumptions are difficult to test due to the fact that measuring quality of life and other events is 
problematic after progression and likely switch to different treatments off-trial. Still, the need for long-
term follow-up not just for OS but as much as possible also for symptoms and quality of life cannot be 
over-emphasized for future drug-developments in this setting. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Results from PROSPER trial are considered to demonstrate a statistically significant advantage in terms 
of MFS for patients with M0 CRPC. The efficacy results in terms of MFS are also supported by other 
secondary endpoints. This is considered a clinical benefit per se, in the absence of indications of a

detrimental effect on OS. Thus, the efficacy of enzalutamide in this setting is considered sufficiently 
demonstrated. Updated OS data are expected. 
The CHMP considers the following measure necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
A post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES) in order to investigate the long-term effects of enzalutamide 
on Overall Survival and relevant secondary endpoints in adult men with high-risk non-metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer. The MAH should submit the results of the MDV3100-14 
(PROSPER) efficacy study. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety profile of enzalutamide in support of its use for the treatment of patients with 
nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is based primarily on the results of the 
pivotal Study MDV3100-14 (PROSPER), a multinational, phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled study in patients with nonmetastatic CRPC at high risk of disease progression based on 
rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and PSA doubling time.  
In addition to Study MDV3100-14, the safety profile of enzalutamide in patients with either 
nonmetastatic or metastatic CRPC is derived from the following clinical studies involving 5464 patients: 
•  Two randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 studies in chemotherapy-naïve patients with 
metastatic CRPC (MDV3100-03 [PREVAIL] and 9785-CL-0232 [Asian PREVAIL]). In Study 
9785-CL-0232, data from Site 105 was excluded due to data quality. 
•  One randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study in patients with metastatic CRPC 
previously treated with docetaxel-based chemotherapy (CRPC2 [AFFIRM]). 
•  Two randomized, bicalutamide-controlled, phase 2 studies in patients with metastatic CRPC 
(9785-CL-0222 [TERRAIN]) and with nonmetastatic or metastatic CRPC (MDV3100-09 
[STRIVE]). In the study MDV3100-09, 197 patients were treated with enzalutamide (69 
nonmetastatic and 128 metastatic) and 198 received bicalutamide (69 nonmetastatic and 129 
metastatic). 
Together these studies include 3179 patients treated with enzalutamide plus standard of care that 
make up the integrated safety population. Of the 3179 enzalutamide-treated patients in the integrated 
safety population, a total of 999 patients (31.4%) had nonmetastatic CRPC and 2180 patients (68.6%) 
had metastatic CRPC; 2379 patients (74.8%) did not receive prior docetaxel and were considered 
chemotherapy-naïve and 800 patients (25.2%) had more advanced metastatic CRPC that was 
previously treated with docetaxel (or another cytotoxic chemotherapy). The dose of enzalutamide in all 
studies was 160 mg/day orally.

Table 24. Enzalutamide studies included in the Summary of Clinical Safety 
Patient exposure 
In the MDV3100-14 enzalutamide group, 930 patients received at least 1 dose or partial dose of 
enzalutamide and 465 received placebo. The median duration of treatment was 18.4 months in the 
enzalutamide group vs. 11.1 months for the placebo group. Approximately one-third of patients in 
each treatment group received study drug for ≥ 12 months and < 24 months (33.4% in the 
enzalutamide group and 32.5% in the placebo group); 35% of patients treated with enzalutamide 
remained on study drug for at least 2 years compared with 13% of patients in the placebo group. 
The extent of exposure to study drug is summarized in Table 23. Extent of exposure 
The extent of exposure to enzalutamide in the total enzalutamide group was generally consistent 
across different subgroups (age, race, geographic region and baseline medical conditions).

Adverse events  
The incidence of any TEAE was lower in the MDV3100-14 enzalutamide group (86.9%) compared with 
the phase 3 enzalutamide group (93.2%) and total enzalutamide group (93.3%). The incidence of 
grade ≥ 3 TEAEs was also lower in the MDV3100-14 enzalutamide group (31.4%) compared with the 
phase 3 enzalutamide group (40.1%) and total enzalutamide group (39.8%) as was the incidence of 
serious TEAEs (24.3%, 30.7% and 30.6%) and TEAEs leading to death (3.4%, 3.8% and 3.8%). 
The proportion of TEAEs in the enzalutamide group of Study MDV3100-14 was higher than in the 
placebo group (86.9% vs. 77.4%) as was the proportion of TEAEs in the enzalutamide group of the

phase 3 studies vs. the placebo group (93.2% vs. 89.1%). While the within group differences were 
consistent (the incidences in the enzalutamide groups were higher compared with the placebo groups), 
in general the magnitude of the difference between the enzalutamide and placebo groups was greater 
for Study MDV3100-14 than for the phase 3 studies.  
Table 26. Overall summary of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
Common adverse events 
In Study MDV3100-14, TEAEs reported in ≥ 5% of patients in the enzalutamide group are presented 
by SOC and preferred term [Table 25].  
The SOC with TEAEs reported in ≥10% of patients in both treatment groups were General disorders 
and administration site conditions (47.3% enzalutamide vs. 28.2% placebo), Gastrointestinal disorders 
(37.8% vs. 31.8%), Nervous system disorders (32.5% vs. 14.8%), Musculoskeletal and connective 
tissue disorders (30.5% vs. 25.6%), Vascular disorders (26.2% vs. 15.3%), Infections and infestations 
(24.4% vs. 22.2%), Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (21.1% vs. 11.2%), and Renal and 
urinary disorders (20.5% vs. 27.1%). 
TEAEs most commonly reported (present in ≥ 5% of patients) were fatigue (32.6% enzalutamide vs. 
13.8% placebo), hot flush (13.0% vs. 7.7%), hypertension (11.9% vs. 5.2%), nausea (11.4% vs. 
8.6%), fall (11.4% vs. 4.1%), dizziness (9.8% vs. 4.3%), decreased appetite (9.6% vs. 3.9%), 
constipation (9.1% vs. 6.9%), headache (9.1% vs. 4.5%), asthenia (8.8% vs. 6.0%) and weight 
decreased (5.9% vs. 1.5%). 
In the phase 3 studies, TEAEs reported in ≥ 5% of patients in the enzalutamide group were 
summarized by preferred term (table 26). In Study MDV3100-14, TEAEs occurring in at least 5% of 
Assessment report

patients in the placebo group with a ≥ 2% higher incidence than the enzalutamide group were: urinary 
tract infection (4.1% enzalutamide vs. 6.5% placebo) and urinary retention (2.2% enzalutamide vs. 
6.0% placebo). 
In Phase 3 studies, 1 TEAE occurred in at least 5% of patients in the placebo group with a ≥ 2% higher 
incidence than the enzalutamide group: bone pain (7.5% enzalutamide vs. 10.7% placebo).

Grade ≥ 3 Treatment-emergent Adverse Events 
Overall, the incidence of grade ≥ 3 TEAEs reported in the Study MDV3100-14 was higher in the 
enzalutamide group than in the placebo group (31.4% vs. 23.4%).  
Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs occurring in ≥ 1% of patients in Study MDV3100-14 enzalutamide group and with ≥ 
0.5% higher incidence than the placebo group were hypertension (4.6% enzalutamide vs. 2.2% 
placebo), fatigue (2.9% vs. 0.6%), syncope (1.1% vs. 0.4%), fall (1.3% vs. 0.6%), asthenia (1.2% 
vs. 0.2%) and pneumonia (1.1% vs. 0.4%). The grade ≥ 3 TEAEs present in ≥ 1% of patients that 
were lower in the MDV3100-14 enzalutamide group compared with the placebo group were anaemia 
(1.0% enzalutamide vs. 1.3% placebo), urinary retention (0.4% vs. 1.1%), hydronephrosis (0.1% vs. 
0.6%) and general physical health deterioration (0.2% vs. 0.4%) (Table 27). 
Overall, the incidence of Grade 3 or higher TEAEs was higher in the enzalutamide group compared with 
the placebo group during the first 60, 180, and 365 days of treatment. 
When adjusted for treatment duration, the event rates per 100 patient-years of treatment for these 
events were still higher in the enzalutamide group compared with the placebo group. 
The overall incidence of grade ≥ 3 TEAEs in the enzalutamide group of Study MDV3100-14 (31.4%) 
was lower compared with the enzalutamide group of the phase 3 studies (40.1%) and the total 
enzalutamide group (39.8%). The grade ≥ 3 TEAEs occurring in ≥ 1% of patients that were lower in 
the MDV3100-14 enzalutamide group compared with the enzalutamide group of the phase 3 studies

were spinal cord compression (0.2% MDV3100-14 enzalutamide vs. 3.1% phase 3) anemia (1.0% vs. 
3.7%), back pain (0.2% vs. 2.4%), bone pain (0.1% vs. 1.3%), arthralgia (0.1% vs. 1.3%), general 
physical health deterioration (0.2% vs. 1.5%) and metastatic pain (0 vs. 1.1%). The lower incidence 
of these grade ≥ 3 TEAEs in Study MDV3100-14 likely reflects the study population of patients with 
non-metastatic CRPC. 
Table 29. Grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events experienced by ≥ 1% of patients in the 
phase 3 enzalutamide or placebo groups 
The system organ classes with Grade 3 or higher TEAEs reported in at least 1% of patients in either 
treatment group and a 2% higher incidence in the enzalutamide group compared with the placebo 
group were Vascular disorders (5.6% enzalutamide vs. 3.0% placebo), General disorders and 
administration site conditions (5.2% vs. 2.2%), Infections and infestations (4.8% vs. 2.2%), and 
Nervous system disorders (4.0% vs. 1.3%). Renal and urinary disorders (4.9% vs. 7.7%) was the only 
system organ class with Grade3 or higher TEAEs reported 2% higher in the placebo group compared 
with the enzalutamide group.

Study-drug related adverse events  
Overall, 581 patients (62.5%) in the enzalutamide group and 211 patients (45.4%) in the placebo 
group had study drug-related TEAEs. The system organ classes with study drug-related TEAEs reported 
in the greatest proportion of patients were General disorders and administration site conditions (35.8% 
enzalutamide vs. 18.1%placebo) and Gastrointestinal disorders (20.3% vs. 16.6%).  
Study drug-related TEAEs with at least a 2% higher incidence in the enzalutamide group compared 
with the placebo group were fatigue (28.2% enzalutamide vs. 11.6%placebo), decreased appetite 
(8.0% vs. 1.5%), hot flush (10.4% vs. 6.0%), hypertension (6.6% vs. 3.0%), weight decreased 
(3.7% vs. 0.4%), dizziness (5.8% vs. 2.8%), headache (5.8% vs. 3.0%), nausea (8.0% vs. 5.4%), 
and asthenia (6.7% vs. 4.1%) [Table 29]. Vomiting was the only study drug related adverse event 
with a higher incidence in the placebo group (0.4% vs. 0.9%). 
The drug-related TEAEs occurring at a higher incidence in the MDV3100-14 enzalutamide group 
compared with total enzalutamide group included fatigue, hypertension, dizziness, headache and 
decreased weigh.

Adverse events of special interest 
The pre-specified TEAEs of interest described are seizure, posterior reversible encephalopathy 
syndrome (PRES), cognitive and memory impairment, selected fatigue-related events, neutrophil count 
decreased, hypertension, selected cardiovascular events (major cardiovascular events or MACE), 
hepatic impairment and second primary malignancies excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer. The 
additional TEAEs of clinical interest are falls, fractures, syncope, presyncope, loss of consciousness, 
dizziness, postural dizziness and renal impairment (Table 30. Overall summary of treatment-emergent 
adverse events of interest). 
Table 32. Overall summary of treatment-emergent adverse events of interest 
Convulsion (seizure) 
TEAEs of convulsion (seizure) were reported in 3 patients (0.3%) in the enzalutamide group and no 
patient in the placebo group. All 3 convulsions in the enzalutamide group were considered serious and 
drug-related, and occurred within 180 days of initiating study drug. One convulsion led to study drug 
discontinuation. 
The incidence of any event of convulsion in the enzalutamide group of Study MDV3100-14 was similar 
to the enzalutamide group of the phase 3 studies and to the total enzalutamide group (0.3% vs. 0.4% 
and 0.4%). Overall the incidence of any event of seizure was low. 
TEAEs of convulsion leading to death were not reported in any treatment group. Grade ≥ 3 events of 
convulsion were reported in 2 (0.2%) patients treated with enzalutamide in the Study MDV3100-14 
and 8 (0.3%) patients treated with enzalutamide in phase 3 studies. No patient in the placebo group 
reported TEAEs of grade ≥ 3.

Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) 
PRES is a rare neurological disorder that requires confirmation by brain imaging. PRES has been 
considered an ADR based on 2 post-marketing cases. 
No cases of PRES were identified in Study MDV3100-14, the phase 3 studies, the total enzalutamide, 
placebo or bicalutamide groups. 
The ‘noninfectious encephalopathy/delirium’ SMQ (narrow) was used to search for potential events of 
PRES. The following events were reported for 5 (0.5%) patients in the enzalutamide group of Study 
MDV3100-14 within the noninfectious encephalopathy/delirium SMQ: delirium (n = 3, 0.3%), 
encephalopathy (n = 1, 0.1%) and leukoencephalopathy (n = 1, 0.1%). The only patients in any study 
who had an event within the noninfectious encephalopathy/delirium SMQ leading to death were in the 
placebo group of the phase 3 studies (n = 3, 0.2%) and in bicalutamide group of the phase 2 studies 
(n = 1, 0.3%). No patients in any of the enzalutamide-treated groups had an event of potential PRES 
that led to death. 
Cognitive and Memory Impairment 
The incidence of TEAEs involving impaired cognition and memory (terms within the MedDRA high level 
group term ‘mental impairment disorders’) in the Study MDV3100-14 was higher in the enzalutamide 
group compared with the placebo group (5.2% vs. 1.9%).  
The most frequent preferred terms reported were memory impairment (18 patients [1.9%] in the 
enzalutamide group vs. 4 patients [0.9%] in the placebo group) and disturbance in attention (15 
patients [1.6%] in the enzalutamide group vs. 1 patient [0.2%] in the placebo group). A total of 28 
patients (3.0%) in the enzalutamide group and 5 patients (1.1%) in the placebo group were 
considered to have a TEAE that was related to study drug. When events were adjusted for duration on 
treatment (events per 100 patient-years), the overall event rates were 3.8 in the enzalutamide group 
and 1.8 in the placebo group. 
The incidence of any event of cognitive and memory impairment in the enzalutamide group of Study 
MDV3100-14 was similar to the enzalutamide group of the phase 3 studies and to the total 
enzalutamide group (5.2%, 4.9% and 4.9%). TEAEs of cognitive and memory impairment did not lead 
to any deaths for patients in any treatment group. 
SAEs of cognitive and memory impairment and grade ≥ 3 cognitive and memory impairment events 
were low overall (≤ 1.0%) across the majority of all treatment groups. In the Study MDV3100-14 only 
1 patient in the enzalutamide group and no patient in the placebo group experienced a Grade 3 or 
higher TEAEs of ‘mental impairment’ (the event was a Grade 3 cognitive disorder that led to study 
drug discontinuation). The incidence of TEAEs of cognitive and memory impairment leading to dose 
interruption in the enzalutamide group of Study MDV3100-14 was also low and similar to that in the 
enzalutamide group of the phase 3 studies (0.3% vs. 0.2%). The same is true for the TEAEs leading to 
dose reduction (0.2% vs. 0.1%) and TEAEs as the primary reason for discontinuation (0.2% vs. 
0.3%).

Selected Fatigue-related Events 
Fatigue-related events were analyzed using the preferred terms of fatigue, asthenia, lethargy and 
malaise. 
The incidence of fatigue-related TEAEs was higher in the enzalutamide group compared with the 
placebo group in Study MDV3100-14 (41.4% vs. 20.2%) as well as in the phase 3 studies (45.2% vs. 
31.5%). The incidence of any event of fatigue in the enzalutamide group of Study MDV3100-14 was 
lower than the enzalutamide group of the phase 3 studies and the total enzalutamide group (41.4% 
vs. 45.2% and 44.3%). 
The most common TEAE preferred terms contributing to fatigue-related events were fatigue and 
asthenia. The proportion of patients with the preferred term of fatigue was similar in the enzalutamide 
groups of Study MDV3100-14, the phase 3 studies and the total enzalutamide group (32.6%, 32.7% 
and 32.7%). In both Study MDV3100-14 and the phase 3 studies, the incidence of fatigue was higher 
in enzalutamide groups compared with their respective placebo groups (32.6% vs. 13.8% and 32.7% 
vs. 21.7%). When adjusted for the length of treatment, the event rate per 100 patient-years of fatigue 
was higher in the enzalutamide group as compared with the placebo group of Study MDV3100-14 
(22.9 vs. 13.1) and lower in the enzalutamide group of the phase 3 studies compared with placebo 
(29.5 vs. 33.0). 
Asthenia was the next most commonly reported preferred term. The incidence of asthenia in the 
enzalutamide groups of Study MDV3100-14, the phase 3 studies and the total enzalutamide group was 
8.8%, 12.7% and 11.9%. In both Study MDV3100-14 and the phase 3 studies, the incidence of 
asthenia was higher in the enzalutamide group compared with the placebo group (8.8% vs. 6.0% and 
12.7% vs. 9.0%). When adjusted for the length of treatment, the event rate per 100 patient-years of 
Assessment report  
EMA/41918/2019

asthenia was slightly higher in the enzalutamide group in Study MDV3100-14 compared with placebo 
(6.9 vs. 5.7) and lower in enzalutamide group of the phase 3 studies (12.4 vs. 14.2). 
No deaths were associated with TEAEs of fatigue in any treatment group. 
In general, the enzalutamide groups of Study MDV3100-14, the phase 3 studies and the total 
enzalutamide group had similar incidence of SAEs of fatigue (0.3%, 0.7% and 0.8%), grade ≥ 3 
events of fatigue (4.0%, 5.0% and 4.9%) and any event of fatigue as the primary reason for 
discontinuation (1.9%, 1.1% and 1.3%). 
Table 34. Selected fatigue-related treatment-emergent adverse events 
Neutrophil Count Decreased 
Overall, the TEAE incidence of any event of neutrophil count decreased (involving neutropenia, low 
neutrophil count and low white blood cell count) was higher in the enzalutamide group compared with 
the placebo group of both Study MDV3100-14 (0.9% vs.. 0.2%) and the phase 3 studies (1.4% vs.. 
0.6%). The incidence of any event of neutrophil count decreased in the enzalutamide group of Study 
MDV3100-14 was lower than the enzalutamide group of the phase 3 studies and the total 
enzalutamide group (0.9% vs. 1.4% and 1.4%). 
The most frequent TEAEs of neutrophil count decreased were neutropenia and neutrophil count 
decreased. In both Study MDV3100-14 and the phase 3 studies, the incidence of neutropenia was 
higher in the enzalutamide group compared with placebo group (0.6% vs.. 0.2% and 0.8% vs.. 0.3%). 
The incidence of neutropenia in the enzalutamide group of Study MDV3100-14 was similar compared 
with the phase studies 3 and the total enzalutamide group (0.6%, 0.8% and 0.8%). 
Neutrophil count decreased was the next most common preferred term. The incidence of neutrophil 
count decreased events was low and comparable in the enzalutamide groups of Study MDV3100-14, 
the phase 3 studies and the total enzalutamide group (0.2%, 0.4% and 0.4%). In both Study 
MDV3100-14 and the phase 3 studies, the incidence of neutrophil count decreased was slightly higher 
in enzalutamide group compared with placebo group (0.2% vs. 0 and 0.4% vs. 0.2%). 
There were no patients who had any TEAE of neutrophil count decreased leading to death in any of the 
treatment groups across the studies.

In general, Study MDV3100-14, the phase 3 studies and the total enzalutamide group had low and 
similar incidence of SAEs of neutrophil count decreased (0, 0.1% and 0.1%), grade ≥ 3 events of 
neutrophil count decreased (0.5%, 0.8% and 0.7%) and neutrophil count decreased events as the 
primary reason for discontinuation (0, 0.1% and 0.1%). 
Fall 
Overall, the incidence of TEAEs of fall was higher in the enzalutamide group compared with the placebo 
group of both Study MDV3100-14 (11.4% vs. 4.1%) and the phase 3 studies (9.1% vs. 3.6%). The 
incidence of fall in the enzalutamide group of Study MDV3100-14 was higher than in the enzalutamide 
group of the phase 3 studies and the total enzalutamide group (11.4%, 9.1% and 9.3%). When 
adjusted for treatment duration, the event rate per 100 patient-years of fall was higher in the 
enzalutamide group of Study MDV3100-14 compared with the placebo group (9.5 vs. 4.1). The event 
rate of fall in the enzalutamide group of Study MDV3100-14 was similar to the event rates in the 
enzalutamide group of the phase 3 studies and the total enzalutamide group (9.5, 9.1 and 9.4). 
In general, the incidence of SAEs of fall was low and similar among the enzalutamide groups of Study 
MDV3100-14, the phase 3 studies and the total enzalutamide group (0.8%, 0.6% and 0.6%), as well 
as the incidence of grade ≥ 3 events (1.3%, 1.0% and 1.0%). There were no events of fall as the 
primary reason for discontinuation in Study MDV3100-14 or in the phase 3 studies. No deaths were 
associated with TEAEs of fall in any treatment group across the studies. 
The incidence of fall increased with age. In the enzalutamide group of Study MDV3100-14 the 
proportion of patients with an event of fall was 7.4% in patients < 75 years and 15.8% in patients ≥ 
75 years. A similar pattern was observed in the phase 3 studies and the total enzalutamide group.  
An exploratory analysis of TEAEs of syncope-related events (syncope, presyncope, loss of 
consciousness, dizziness and postural dizziness) reported within 1 day prior to TEAEs of fall was 
performed to evaluate the possible association of syncope-related events with fall. Among patients 
with fall, a similar proportion in the enzalutamide and placebo groups had 1 or more syncope-related 
events within 1 day prior to a fall (5.7% [6/106] vs. 5.3% [1/19] in Study MDV3100-14; 3.5% 
[9/256] vs. 2.9% [2/69] in the phase 3 studies). Among the 106 enzalutamide-treated patients with a 
TEAE of fall in Study MDV3100-14, 4 patients (3.8%) had dizziness, 1 patient had syncope (0.9%) and 
1 patient had a presyncope event (0.9%) within 1 day prior to the TEAE of fall. Among the 256 
enzalutamide-treated patients with a TEAE of fall in phase 3 studies, 6 patients (2.3%) reported 
dizziness, 2 patients had syncope (0.8%) and 1 patient had a presyncope event (0.4%) within 1 day 
prior to the TEAE of fall. 
There were no enzalutamide-treated patients with postural dizziness or loss of consciousness reported 
within 1 day prior to a TEAE of fall in Study MDV3100-14, the phase 3 studies or the total 
enzalutamide group. 
Fractures 
The events of fractures have been previously reported in patients treated with enzalutamide. In the 
Study MDV3100-14 a higher incidence of fractures was reported in the enzalutamide group compared 
with the placebo group (11.2% vs. 5.6%). The most common types of fracture reported among the 
enzalutamide groups of Study MDV3100-14, the phase 3 studies and total enzalutamide group were rib 
fracture (4.2%, 2.4% and 2.5%), followed by spinal compression fracture (1.8%, 1.2% and 1.2%), 
femur fracture (0.5%, 0.4% and 0.3%) and upper limb fracture (0.5%, 0.3% and 0.3%). 
When adjusted for treatment duration, the event rates per 100 patient-years of fracture was higher in 
the enzalutamide group of Study MDV3100-14 (9.5 vs. 5.1) and in the enzalutamide groups of the 
phase 3 studies (8.1 vs. 4.8) compared to placebo.

In general, the incidences of SAEs of fractures were low and similar among the enzalutamide groups of 
Study MDV3100-14, the phase 3 studies and the total enzalutamide group (2.8%, 2.9% and 3.0%), as 
were grade ≥ 3 events of fracture (2.4%, 2.6% and 2.7%) and any event of fracture as the primary 
reason for discontinuation (0.2%, 0.1% and 0.1 %). One event of fracture, occurring in an 
enzalutamide-treated patient in Study MDV3100-14, led to a fatal outcome due to complications of 
fracture.  
The incidence of fractures increased with the length of treatment duration, with the majority of 
fractures reported after 180 days of study treatment. 
Syncope, Presyncope, Loss of Consciousness, Dizziness and Postural Dizziness 
SAEs, grade ≥ 3 TEAEs and TEAEs as the primary reason for discontinuation were uncommon for 
events of syncope, presyncope, loss of consciousness, dizziness and postural dizziness in Study 
MDV3100-14 and in the phase 3 studies.  
The incidence and/or event rates of syncope, loss of consciousness and postural dizziness were similar 
between the enzalutamide and placebo groups in Study MDV3100-14 and in the phase 3 studies.  
The incidence of presyncope was low, but higher in the enzalutamide group compared with the placebo 
in Study MDV3100-14 (1.0% vs. 0) and in the phase 3 studies (1.0% vs. 0.2%).  
In Study MDV3100-14, the incidence of dizziness was higher in the enzalutamide group compared with 
the placebo group (9.8% vs. 4.3%) with event rates of 7.2 vs. 4.9. In the phase 3 studies, the 
incidence of dizziness was also higher in the enzalutamide group (8.6% vs. 5.4%), however event 
rates adjusted for duration of treatment were lower in the enzalutamide group (7.7 vs. 8.5). 
No enzalutamide-treated patients died due to a TEAE of syncope, presyncope, loss of consciousness, 
dizziness or postural dizziness. 
An exploratory analysis of TEAEs of syncope, presyncope, loss of consciousness, dizziness and postural 
dizziness reported within 1 day prior to fall TEAEs does not suggest an association of these events with 
falls among enzalutamide-treated patients. 
Hypertension 
Hypertension is a known adverse event related to enzalutamide treatment and already described in 
previous studies. In the Study MDV3100-14 the incidence hypertension was higher in the enzalutamide 
group compared with the placebo group (12.3% vs. 5.4%) as it was in the phase 3 studies (11.3% vs. 
4.3%).  
When adjusted for treatment duration, the event rate for hypertension was higher in enzalutamide 
groups compared with the placebo group in both Study MDV3100-14 (8.4 vs. 5.1) and phase 3 studies 
(9.4 vs. 5.7). The incidence of any event of hypertension was comparable in the enzalutamide group of 
Study MDV3100-14, the phase 3 studies and the total enzalutamide group (12.3%, 11.3% and 
11.7%). 
TEAEs of hypertension leading to death were not reported in any treatment group. In Study MDV3100-
14, 1 enzalutamide-treated patient experienced an event of grade 4 hypertension. 
Overall the incidence of SAEs of hypertension was low and similar in the enzalutamide groups of Study 
MDV3100-14, the phase 3 studies and in the total enzalutamide group (0.3%, 0.3% and 0.4%). 
Similar trends were reported for grade ≥ 3 TEAEs (4.6%, 4.8% and 5.1%). The incidence of TEAEs of 
hypertension as the primary reason for study drug discontinuation was low for the enzalutamide 
groups in Study MDV3100-14 and the phase 3 studies (0.1%). TEAEs of hypertension leading to dose

interruption or dose reduction were more frequent in the enzalutamide groups in Study MDV3100-14 
and the phase 3 studies, compared with their respective placebo group. 
The incidence of hypertension was similar in enzalutamide-treated patients with and without history of 
hypertension and were higher compared with those in the placebo groups (12.1% vs.. 5.0% in patients 
with prior history of hypertension and 11.7% vs. 5.6% in patients without hypertension history).  
Overall, the incidence of events of hypertension in Study MDV3100-14 was similar to the incidence 
observed in enzalutamide-treated patients in prior studies with less than 1.0% events being reported 
as 
SAEs, approximately 5% of patients experienced grade ≥ 3 events and permanent discontinuations 
from study treatment due to hypertension were rare. 
Selected Cardiovascular Events 
In Study MDV3100-14, 5.2% of patients in the enzalutamide group and 2.8% of patients in the 
placebo group experienced a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE). MACE included a composite 
of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular TEAEs based on narrow SMQs of ‘myocardial infarction’, ‘cardiac 
failure’, haemorrhagic cerebrovascular conditions’, and ‘ischaemic cerebrovascular conditions’. 
The MACE rates (events per 100 patient-years) were 4.1 vs. 2.9 in the enzalutamide and placebo 
groups.  
Grade 3 or higher MACE occurred in 34 of 48 patients (70.8%) in the enzalutamide group and 8 of 13 
patients (61.5%) in the placebo group. The majority of Grade 3 or higher MACE occurred after 365 
days. In both treatment groups, the majority of MACE was assessed as serious (36 of 48 patients in 
the enzalutamide group and 8 of 13 patients in the placebo group). 
In Study MDV3100-14, MACE incidence was similar for the enzalutamide group compared with the 
placebo group in days 1 to 30 (0.2% vs. 0) and days 181 to 365 (1.1% vs. 1.1%), but was higher in 
the enzalutamide group compared with the placebo group for days 31 to 180 (1.2% vs. 0.4%) and > 
365 days (4.5% vs. 3.8%). In the phase 3 studies, MACE incidence was similar for the enzalutamide 
group compared with the placebo group across all discrete time periods (0.3% vs. 0.2% for days 1 to 
30; 1.4% vs. 1.2% for days 31 to 180; 1.6% vs. 1.3% for days 181 to 365 and 3.3% vs. 3.2% for > 
365 days). 
To further characterize a treatment group imbalance in MACE observed in Study MDV3100-14, an 
additional composite, designated as Antiplatelet Trialists’ Collaboration (APTC) MACE (vascular death, 
nonfatal MI, and nonfatal cerebrovascular accident) was included.  
In Study MDV3100-14, 4.2% of patients in the enzalutamide group and 2.2% of patients in the 
placebo group experienced an APTC MACE. The APTC MACE rates (events per 100 patient-years) were 
3.3 vs. 2.3 in the enzalutamide and placebo groups. 
In Study MDV3100-14, the enzalutamide group had APTC MACE incidence of 0.2% in days 1 to 30 
compared with no events in the placebo group. The APTC MACE incidence was higher in the 
enzalutamide group compared with the placebo group between days 31 to 180 (0.7% vs. 0.2%), days 
181 to 365 (1.3% vs. 0.6%) and > 365 days (3.7% vs. 3.3%). In the phase 3 studies (Study 
MDV3100-14 pooled with the other 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase 3 studies), 
APTC MACE incidence was similar for the enzalutamide group compared with the placebo group across 
all discrete time periods (0.2% vs. 0.2% for days 1 to 30; 1.0% vs. 1.1% for days 31 to 180; 1.2% 
vs. 1.0% for days 181 to 365; 2.7% vs. 2.5% for > 365 days).

Second primary malignancies 
Overall, the incidence of second primary malignancies was higher in the enzalutamide group of Study 
MDV3100-14 compared with the placebo group (2.9% vs. 1.1%). In the phase 3 studies, the incidence 
of any second primary malignancy was also higher in the enzalutamide group compared with the 
placebo group (2.4% vs. 0.9%). The incidence of any second primary malignancy in the enzalutamide 
group of Study MDV3100-14 was similar to the enzalutamide group of the phase 3 studies and to the 
total enzalutamide group (2.9% vs. 2.4% and 2.5%). 
After adjustment for length of treatment duration, second primary malignancy event rates per 100 
patient-years were higher for the enzalutamide-treated patients compared with the placebo groups in 
Study MDV3100-14 (2.1 vs. 1.0) and the phase 3 studies (2.0 vs. 1.4). 
The most common second primary malignancies in the enzalutamide group of Study MDV3100-14 were 
adenocarcinoma of the colon (0.5%), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (0.2%), bladder cancer (0.2%) 
and bladder transitional cell carcinoma (0.2%). All other reported second primary malignancies in the 
enzalutamide group had only 1 reported TEAE (by preferred term).  
The proportion of patients in the enzalutamide group of Study MDV3100-14 with a second primary 
malignancy that lead to death (0.5%) was slightly higher than in placebo group (0.2%) and the same 
pattern was observed in the phase 3 studies (0.3% vs. 0.1% ).

Serious adverse events 
Overall, the incidence of treatment-emergent SAEs reported in the MDV3100-14 enzalutamide group 
was higher than the incidence for the MDV3100-14 placebo group (24.3% vs. 18.3%). Of these, 
serious TEAEs considered related to study drug occurred in 3.4% of patients in the enzalutamide group 
and 2.6% in the placebo group. 
The proportion of study-drug-related treatment emergent SAEs in the MDV3100-14 enzalutamide 
group was similar to the enzalutamide and placebo groups of the phase 3 studies (3.3% and 3.2%) 
and the total enzalutamide group (3.6%). 
Serious TEAEs reported in at least 1% of patients in either treatment group included hematuria and 
pneumonia in the enzalutamide group and hematuria, urinary retention, renal failure acute and urinary 
tract infection in the placebo group. In Study MDV3100-14, the only SAE in ≥ 1% patients that was ≥ 
0.5% higher in the enzalutamide group compared with placebo group was pneumonia (1.0% vs. 
0.2%). Conversely, SAE reported in ≥ 1% of patients in either treatment group that was ≥ 0.5% 
higher in the placebo group of Study MDV3100-14 compared with the enzalutamide group were urinary 
retention (1.7% vs. 0.8%), acute renal failure (0.4% vs. 1.5%) and urinary tract infection (0.5% vs. 
1.3%). 
In both treatment groups, a high proportion of patients with serious TEAEs occurred in the SOC 
Cardiac disorders (4.8% in the enzalutamide group vs. 2.4% in the placebo group). 
When adjusted for treatment duration, the event rates for these treatment-emergent SAEs showed a 
pattern of reversal of the differences in incidences between the phase 3 enzalutamide and placebo 
groups for pneumonia (1.1 enzalutamide vs. 1.1 placebo), anemia (1.4 vs. 2.4), general physical 
health deterioration (1.0 vs. 1.4), spinal cord compression (2.5 vs. 3.2) and metastatic pain (1.1 vs. 
1.7).

Deaths 
A total of 103 enzalutamide-treated patients (11.0%) and 62 placebo-treated patients (13.2%) died as 
of the data cutoff date of study MDV3100-14. Disease progression was the most common cause of 
death reported on the end of study CRF (5.5% of enzalutamide-treated patients and 9.6% of placebo-
treated patients), followed by death due to other causes (5.3% vs. 3.4%) which included TEAEs 
leading to death, and deaths due to unknown causes (0.3% vs. 0.2%). 
One patient (0.1%) in the enzalutamide group died within 30 days of initiation of study drug (an acute 
myocardial infarction 21 days after initiating study drug), and a total of 28 patients (3.0%) in the 
enzalutamide group and 2 patients (0.4%) in the placebo group died within 30 days of discontinuation 
of study drug. 
TEAEs leading to death in at least 2 patients in the total enzalutamide group are presented in Table 37. 
Summary of all deaths. The proportion of patients with TEAEs leading to death was higher in the 
enzalutamide group of Study MDV3100-14 than in the placebo group (3.4% vs. 0.6%). Of the 32 
patients who had TEAEs leading to death in the enzalutamide group, 2 patients had TEAES that were 
considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug (general physical health deterioration 
and duodenal ulcer hemorrhage).  
The majority of deaths (19 [2.4%] in the enzalutamide group vs. 2 [0.7%] patients in the placebo 
group) occurred > 365 days after initiating study drug. The most frequently reported preferred terms 
leading to death were myocardial infarction (MI) (0.4%), general physical health deterioration (0.2%) 
and acute MI (0.2%). 
In the Study MDV3100-14 the system organ classes with the highest percentage of reported TEAEs 
leading to deaths (≥0.5% in either treatment group) were Cardiac disorders (1.0% enzalutamide vs. 
0.4% placebo). In the total enzalutamide group TEAEs leading to death was reported under the SOC of 
general disorders and administration site conditions followed by cardiovascular disorders. The most 
frequently reported preferred terms included general physical health deterioration (0.6%), death 
(0.2%), disease progression (0.2%), acute MI (0.2%), cardiac failure (0.2%) and pneumonia (0.2%).

When adjusted for treatment duration, the event rates for these TEAEs leading to death in the total 
enzalutamide group were low: general physical health deterioration (0.5), death (0.2), disease 
progression (0.2), acute MI (0.1), cardiac failure (0.1) and pneumonia (0.1).

Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Overall, the incidence of grade 3 and 4 post-baseline hematology toxicities occurring in enzalutamide-
treated patients in Study MDV3100-14 was low (≤ 0.6% of patients across all parameters). 
In the Study MDV3100-14, the proportions of patients with low lymphocyte count and low hemoglobin 
in the enzalutamide group were similar to those reported in the placebo group (0.4% vs. 0.2% for low 
lymphocytes and 0.6% vs. 0.4% for low hemoglobin, respectively). This may in part be indicative of 
the nonmetastatic disease patient population in Study MDV3100-14. The proportion of patients with 
these hematology toxicities was lower in the enzalutamide group of Study MDV3100-14 than in the 
enzalutamide groups of the phase 3 studies (3.6% and 2.2%) and in the total enzalutamide groups 
(3.6% and 2.2%). In the enzalutamide group of the phase 3 studies, the proportion of patients with 
low lymphocyte count and low hemoglobin was comparable to the proportion of patients with events in 
their respective placebo group. However, the proportion of patients with these hematology toxicities 
was lower in the placebo group of Study MDV3100-14 than the proportion of patients with events in 
the placebo group of the phase 3 studies (0.2% vs. 3.6% for low lymphocytes and 0.4% vs. 2.0% for 
low hemoglobin). 
Tabla 41. Hematology Results: Summary of Grade 3 and 4 Post-baseline Laboratory Toxicities 
Chemistry 
The most common grade 3 and 4 postbaseline chemistry laboratory toxicity in Study MDV3100-14 was 
high glucose. The proportion of patients with high glucose in the enzalutamide group of Study 
MDV3100-14 was higher than the MDV3100-14 placebo group (2.9% vs. 1.3%). The proportion of 
patients with high glucose in the enzalutamide group of the phase 3 studies was higher compared with 
the phase 3 placebo group (2.9% vs. 2.3%).  
The proportion of patients with high glucose in the enzalutamide group of Study MDV3100-14 and the 
phase 3 studies was the same (2.9% each) but was lower than the proportion of patients with high 
glucose in the total enzalutamide groups (3.5%).  
With the exception of high alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and low sodium, the proportion of all other 
grade 3 and 4 postbaseline laboratories toxicities occurred in < 2% of patients in any treatment group.

Hepatic impairment 
The incidence of TEAEs of hepatic impairment was lower in the enzalutamide group compared with the 
placebo group in both Study MDV3100-14 (1.2% vs. 1.9%) and in the phase 3 studies (1.9% vs. 
2.4%).  
Table 43. TEAEs of hepatic impairment  
No hepatic impairment events met Hy’s Law criteria in Study MDV3100-14, the phase 3 studies or the 
phase 2 studies. 
Three enzalutamide-treated patients (1 in Study MDV3100-14, 1 in Study MDV3100-03 and 1 in Study 
MDV3100-09) died due to a TEAE of hepatic impairment. In all 3 patients, the fatal hepatic event was 
assessed as unrelated to the study drug by the investigator. 
In general, the incidence of SAEs of hepatic impairment was low and similar among Study MDV3100-
14, the phase 3 studies and the total enzalutamide group (0.2%, 0.2% and 0.3%), as was the 
incidence of grade ≥ 3 events of hepatic impairment (0.5%, 0.6% and 0.7%) and hepatic impairment 
events as the primary reason for discontinuation (0.1%, 0.2% and 0.3%).

Renal impairment 
Overall, the incidence of TEAEs of renal impairment was lower in the enzalutamide group of Study 
MDV3100-14 compared with the placebo group (1.7% vs. 4.1%). In the phase 3 studies, the incidence 
of any event of renal impairment was also lower in the enzalutamide group compared with the placebo 
group (2.8% vs. 4.3%). The incidence of any event of renal impairment in the enzalutamide group of 
Study MDV3100-14 was lower than the enzalutamide group of the phase 3 studies and the total 
enzalutamide group (1.7% vs. 2.8% and 3.0%). 
The most frequent TEAEs of renal impairment were increased blood creatinine and acute renal failure. 
The incidence of increased blood creatinine in the enzalutamide group of Study MDV3100-14 was lower 
compared with the phase studies 3 and the total enzalutamide group (0.6% vs. 1.1% and 1.2%). The 
incidence of increased blood creatinine was the lower in enzalutamide group compared with placebo 
group in both Study MDV3100-14 (1.7% vs. 4.1%) and the phase 3 studies (2.8% vs. 4.3%). Acute 
renal failure was the next most common preferred term. The incidence was low in the enzalutamide 
groups of the MDV3100-14, phase 3 studies and total enzalutamide group (0.9%, 0.8% and 0.9 %). 
The incidence of acute renal failure was lower in enzalutamide group compared with placebo group in 
both Study MDV3100-14 (0.9% vs. 1.9%) and the phase 3 studies (0.8% vs. 1.2%). 
One patient in the enzalutamide group of Study MDV3100-14 and 1 patient in CRPC2 study 
experienced a TEAE of renal impairment leading to death. 
In general, the incidence of SAEs of renal impairment was low and similar among the Study MDV3100-
14, phase 3 and total enzalutamide groups (0.5%, 0.6% and 0.7%), as was the incidence of grade ≥ 3 
events of renal impairment (0.5%, 1.0% and 1.1%) and renal impairment events as the primary 
reason for discontinuation (0.1%, 0.1% and 0.2%).

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Treatment-emergent adverse events leading to discontinuation 
In Study MDV3100-14, the proportion of patients with TEAEs reported as the primary reason for 
permanent discontinuation of study drug was higher in the enzalutamide group compared with placebo 
(9.4% enzalutamide vs. 6.0% placebo). The phase 3 studies had similar rates of discontinuation due to 
TEAE in both enzalutamide and placebo groups (8.2% vs. 8.1%) as did the total enzalutamide group 
(8.1%). 
In the MDV3100-14 enzalutamide group, the most frequent TEAEs reported as the primary reason for 
permanent discontinuation of study drug included fatigue (1.6%) followed by MI (0.4%), cardiac 
failure (0.3%), cerebrovascular accident (0.3%) and nausea (0.3%). In the phase 3 studies 
enzalutamide group, the most frequent TEAEs reported as the primary reason for permanent 
discontinuation of study drug included fatigue (0.8%) followed by nausea (0.4%) and cerebrovascular 
accident (0.3%). 
Treatment-emergent adverse events leading to dose modification 
Dose reductions 
Overall, the proportion of patients with TEAEs leading to a dose reduction was higher in the 
enzalutamide group compared with the respective placebo group in Study MDV3100-14 (10.1% vs. 
2.8%) and the phase 3 studies (4.7% vs. 1.8%). 
In the MDV3100-14 enzalutamide group, the most frequent TEAEs leading to a reduction in the dose of 
study drug included fatigue (3.9%) followed by asthenia (1.4%) and hypertension (1.0%). In the 
enzalutamide group of the phase 3 studies, the most frequent TEAEs leading to a reduction in the dose 
of study drug included fatigue (1.6%) followed by asthenia (0.5%), nausea (0.4%), hypertension 
(0.3%) and dizziness (0.3%). 
Dose interruptions 
Overall, the proportion of patients with TEAEs leading to a dose interruption was higher in the 
enzalutamide group compared with the respective placebo group in Study MDV3100-14 (15.4% vs. 
8.6%) and the phase 3 studies (13.2% vs. 10.8%). The incidence of TEAEs leading to a dose 
interruption was higher in enzalutamide group of MDV3100-14 compared with total enzalutamide 
group (15.4% vs. 13.4%). 
For the enzalutamide groups of the MDV3100-14 and the phase 3 studies, the most frequent TEAEs 
leading to an interruption in the dose of the study drug were similar. In the MDV3100-14 enzalutamide 
group, the most frequent TEAEs leading to an interruption in the dose of study drug included fatigue 
(2.8%) followed by hypertension (1.3%) and decreased appetite (1.2%). The most frequent TEAEs 
leading to an interruption in the dose of study drug in the enzalutamide group of the phase 3 studies 
included fatigue (1.5%) followed by hypertension (0.8%), decreased appetite (0.7%) and asthenia 
(0.7%). 
Post marketing experience 
The cumulative exposure from marketing experience is estimated to be 184070 patient treatment-
years (67922 patient treatment-years in Europe). 
Six PSURs for Xtandi (enzalutamide) have been submitted to regulatory authorities since August 2012. 
A total of 83138 ADRs have been reported from postmarketing data sources. During the reporting 
period for PSUR 6, an assessment of postmarketing events revealed no safety concerns related to the 
7 important identified risks (seizure, PRES, hypertension, neutrophil count decreased,

cognitive/memory impairment, fall and fracture) and 2 important identified interactions (interactions 
with strong inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 and interactions with medicinal 
products that are substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19) listed in the current enzalutamide EU 
risk management plan (v 12.0, Jul 2017).  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
So far, 3179 patients with prostate cancer have been treated with enzalutamide in clinical trials. The 
safety profile of enzalutamide for the proposed indication is based mainly on a phase 3 study 
(MDV3100-14 - PROSPER), in which 930 patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate 
cancer (CRPC) at high risk of disease progression (based on rising PSA and PSA doubling time) 
received enzalutamide.  
The safety database includes data from the MDV3100-14 study and integrated safety data from the 
Phase III placebo-controlled studies i.e. MDV3100-14, MDV3100-03 (PREVAIL, conducted in 
asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic chemotherapy-naive patients), CRPC2 (AFFIRM, conducted in 
patients with metastatic CRPC who had received prior docetaxel) and 9785-CL-0232 (Asian PREVAIL) 
and data from two Phase II, bicalutamide-controlled studies (9785-CL-0222 [TERRAIN] and MDV3100-
09 [STRIVE]).  
In the study MDV3100-14 the median duration of treatment was 18.4 months in the enzalutamide 
group compared with 11.1 months for the placebo group, thus a higher rate of adverse events would 
be expectable with enzalutamide. A similar proportion of patients (33 %) received study drug in the 
≥12 and < 24 months range in the respective arms however a higher proportion of enzalutamide 
treated patients (35%) received study drug for ≥ 24 months compared with the placebo group (13 %). 
The exposure was shorter for the other Phase III studies compared with study MDV3100-14 likely due 
to these patients experiencing more advanced disease. 
The population included in the study MDV3100-14 was well balanced between treatment groups. It 
encompasses patients with a median age of 74 years (47.5% of patients were 75 years or older), with 
nonmetastatic disease (97%) and a good performance status (baseline ECOG 0 in 80% of patients and 
ECOG 1 in 19.9% of patients). Approximately 21% of enzalutamide-treated patients had medical 
history of hypertension. Patients with past history of seizure or conditions that predispose to an 
increased risk of seizure, creatinine values > 2 mg/dL, unacceptable haematology values, liver 
chemistry tests more than twice the upper limit of normal (ULN) or any clinically significant 
cardiovascular disease were excluded. 
Overall, the incidence of TEAEs was higher in the enzalutamide group compared with the placebo 
group (86.9% vs. 77.4%, respectively) with the most commonly reported TEAEs (≥ 5% of patients) 
being fatigue (32.6% vs. 13.8%), hot flush (13.0% vs. 7.7%), hypertension (11.9% vs. 5.2%), 
nausea (11.4% vs. 8.6%), fall (11.4% vs. 4.1%), dizziness (9.8% vs. 4.3%), decreased appetite 
(9.6% vs. 3.9%), constipation (9.1% vs. 6.9%), headache (9.1% vs. 4.5%), asthenia (8.8% vs. 
6.0%) and weight decreased (5.9% vs. 1.5%). When adjusted for the duration of treatment, 
differences versus placebo were reduced; fatigue, decreased appetite and hypertension remained 
higher in the enzalutamide group (≥ 2% higher incidence compared to placebo). In general, a lower 
incidence of TEAEs was reported in the pivotal study as compared to the integrated data sets. 
TEAEs considered by the investigator to be drug-related were reported in 62.4% of patients treated 
with enzalutamide and 45.4% of patients in the placebo group. Of these, fatigue, decreased appetite,

hypertension, weight decreased, dizziness and dysgeusia were at least twice more frequently reported 
in the enzalutamide arm. 
Grade 3 or higher AEs were reported in 31.4% of patients treated with enzalutamide compared to 
23.4% in the placebo arm. Hypertension (4.6% enzalutamide vs. 2.2% placebo), fatigue (2.9% vs. 
0.6%), syncope (1.1% vs. 0.4%), fall (1.3% vs. 0.6%), asthenia (1.2% vs. 0.2%) and pneumonia 
(1.1% vs. 0.4%) were grade≥ 3 AEs more frequent (≥ 0.5% higher incidence) in the enzalutamide 
group than in the placebo group. 
AEs considered of special interest reported during study MDV3100-14 include seizure, cognitive and 
memory impairment, neutrophil count decreased, hypertension, fatigue, select cardiovascular events, 
hepatic impairment, second primary malignancies, falls, fractures, syncope and renal impairment. 
These were selected based on previously recognised important identified risks and/or feedback from 
regulatory authorities recommending surveillance. 
In the enzalutamide group 3 patients (0.3%) experienced a seizure, which were considered by the 
investigator as possibly related to study drug. No patient in the placebo group reported any event of 
seizure. In the combined enzalutamide group, 13 (0.4%) events were reported (relevant warning 
reflected in SmPC).  
The incidence of TEAEs of any event of neutrophil count decreased was higher in enzalutamide treated 
patients compared to placebo (MDV3100-14: 0.9% vs. 0.2%; Phase III studies: 1.4% vs 0.6%). In the 
total enzalutamide group the proportion was 1.4 %, none fatal. The incidences were low for serious 
TEAEs (0.1 %), grade ≥  3 events (0.7 %) and as the primary reason for permanent discontinuation 
(0.1 %). Dose interruptions and dose reductions due to neutrophil count decreased were 0.2 % and 
0.1 % in the total enzalutamide dataset, respectively. There were no reports of cases of febrile 
neutropenia. Of the nine patients reported with TEAEs of neutropenia, two cases were identified with 
concurrent infections. One case with cough Grade 1 (Day 286) which did not result in either 
hospitalisation or discontinuation from study (discontinuation subsequently occurred on Day 409 due 
to PD) and a second patient that had what seems like a transient event of neutropenia grade 1 during 
which time he experienced and was treated for a herpes zoster infection (no action was taken in terms 
of study drug).  
Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were reported in a higher number of patients in the 
enzalutamide group compared with the placebo group (5.2% vs. 2.8%, respectively) and so did grade 
3 or higher MACE. When adjusted for treatment duration, those differences remained higher in the 
enzalutamide arm (4.1 vs. 2.9) although in line with data from previous phase 3 studies. In patients 
with baseline history of cardiovascular disease event rates were slightly higher (9.9 enzalutamide and 
8.6 placebo vs. 2.6 enzalutamide and 1.5 placebo). 
Hypertension is a common adverse event of enzalutamide, reflected in the SmPC. In study MDV3100-
14 hypertension was reported in 12.3% of patients treated with enzalutamide compared with 5.4% of 
patients that received placebo. No differences were observed in the incidence of hypertension 
according to baseline history of hypertension (12.1% history of hypertension vs. 11.7% no history of 
hypertension). 
Fatigue and asthenia are common adverse events related to enzalutamide treatment. In study 
MDV300-14 fatigue was reported in 32.6% of patients treated with enzalutamide compared with 
13.8% with placebo. Additionally, fatigue is a common symptom in patients with advanced cancer, so 
a lower incidence would be expected in patients with nonmetastatic disease. In contrast, the incidence 
of fatigue in study MDV300-14, in patients with no metastatic disease and a better performance status, 
was similar to that reported in previous phase III trials in patients with metastatic disease. 
Assessment report  
EMA/41918/2019 
Page 77/90 
 
 
  
Adverse events of fractures were reported in 11.2% of patients treated with enzalutamide compared to 
5.5% with placebo. The incidence increases with the longer exposure to study treatment. Similar 
proportions were observed in the combined Phase III safety dataset (10.2% vs. 4.4%) as well as in 
the enzalutamide group (10.3%). A similar difference between enzalutamide and placebo remained 
when adjusted for treatment duration all through the presented safety datasets. This is reflected in the 
SmPC. 
Most commonly types of fracture reported in enzalutamide treated patients in the MDV3100-14 were 
rib fracture (4.2%), spinal compression fracture (1.8%), femur fracture (0.5%) and upper limb 
fracture (0.5%). The study protocol did not include a required assessment of fractures as “non-
pathological” vs. “pathological”, therefore the proportion of pathological vs. non-pathological fractures 
in enzalutamide vs. placebo treated patients cannot be reliably elucidated. 
The incidence of fall was higher in the enzalutamide treated patients compared to placebo (106 
[11.4%] vs. 19 [4.1%]). This was also observed when adjusting for treatment duration (9.5% vs. 
4.1%). A post-hoc analysis revealed that 51/106 patients in the enzalutamide group and 10/19 in the 
placebo arm experienced a fracture within two days of a reported fall. Thus, 49% of patients that 
reported a fracture in the enzalutamide arm and 38.5% in the placebo arm had suffer from a previous 
fall.  
A higher incidence of second primary malignancies, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers, was 
reported in the enzalutamide group compared to the placebo group (2.9% vs. 1.1%, respectively). 
When adjusted for treatment duration, event rates per 100 patient-year remained higher in the 
enzalutamide group (2.1 enzalutamide vs. 1.0 placebo). Similar data have been reported in patients 
treated with enzalutamide in the Phase III studies (2.4% vs. 0.9%) and in the total enzalutamide 
group (2.5%). Second primary malignancies were reported across a variety of different organ systems 
and cell types. A total of five patients in the integrated safety population were identified with second 
primary malignancies considered by the investigator to be possibly or probably drug-related. However, 
no obvious mechanistic rationale for androgen receptor inhibition to cause specifically these 
malignancies can be established. Enzalutamide has shown to be carcinogenic in non clinical trials. The 
relevance of these findings in humans is unknown, but the potential risk of enzalutamide to develop 
second primary malignancies cannot be ruled out (see 5.3 of SmPC). Furthermore, due to the non-
clinical findings related to urinary bladder carcinogenicity of enzalutamide, a signal will be triggered to 
further study these pre-clinical findings and relevance for human use. 
For both renal and hepatic impairment the incidences were lower in the enzalutamide arm as 
compared to placebo in the pivotal study (renal impairment 1.7% vs. 4.1%; hepatic impairment 1.2% 
vs. 1.9%). No Hy’s Law cases were identified. One fatality due to renal impairment occurred in the 
MDV3100-14 study not deemed related to study drug. It is to be noted that patients with advanced 
renal or hepatic impairment were not eligible into the MDV3100-1334 study.  
The incidence of SAEs in the enzalutamide group was higher than in the placebo group (24.3% vs. 
18.3%), although only in 3.4% of patients that received enzalutamide SAEs were considered related to 
study drug by the investigator. In addition, differences between treatment arms were driven mainly by 
the higher number of SAEs reported in the enzalutamide group after one year of treatment compared 
to placebo (106 [11.4%] enzalutamide vs. 24 [5.2%] placebo). In the enzalutamide group, hematuria 
and pneumonia were the only SAEs reported in ≥ 1%. SAEs reported in a higher percentage of 
patients in the enzalutamide group (incidence ≥0.5% or double) were pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, 
fall, cardiac failure myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease. 
As of the data cutoff, 103 (11.0%) and 62 (13.2%) patients had died in the enzalutamide and placebo 
y group, respectively. The majority of deaths were due to disease progression (5.4% enzalutamide vs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/41918/2019 
Page 78/90 
 
 
  
9.7% placebo). A higher number of deaths were related to AEs in the enzalutamide group compared to 
placebo group (32 [3.4%] enzalutamide vs. 3 [0.6%] placebo), with myocardial infarction as the main 
AE resulting in death in the enzalutamide arm. Additionally, there were 3 deaths of unknown cause in 
the enzalutamide group and a higher number of deaths occurred within 30 days after discontinuation 
of study drug. 
Regarding safety in special populations, no important safety issues have been identified. According to 
baseline weight (≤ median vs. > median) the incidence of AEs, SAEs and ≥ 3 AEs appear similar 
between groups (data not shown). AEs were analysed per age group, < 65 years (13.0%), 65 to 74 
years (39.5%) and ≥ 75 years (47.5%). The frequency of AEs of any grade, AEs of grade ≥ 3, and 
SAEs increased with each age group but it is expectable due do the increased sensitivity for AEs with 
increasing age.  
Patients with baseline history of hypertension, reported a higher incidence of AEs of any grade (88.9% 
history of hypertension vs. 83.7% no history of hypertension), SAEs (27.1% vs. 20.1%) and AEs of 
grade ≥ 3 (34.6% vs. 26.6%) compared to patients without baseline history of hypertension and 
compared to patients that received placebo. Within SAEs and Grade ≥ 3 AEs, a higher incidence of 
cardiac disorders was reported in patients with a baseline history of hypertension compared to those 
without previous history of hypertension (SAEs: 5.3% vs. 2.4%; Grade ≥3 TEAEs: 5.9% vs. 2.2%). 
These differences were lower in the placebo group and in the combined phase 3 population. However, 
considering the combined phase 3 studies and after adjusting for treatment duration, a similar trend of 
a higher incidence of cardiac disorders in patients with previous history of hypertension was observed 
in both treatment arms (enzalutamide and placebo). 
Additionally, the applicant has provided an analysis of other risk factors and the presence of selected 
cardiovascular events (defined as Myocardial Infarction and Other Ischemic Heart Disease) and overall 
a similar pattern was observed. It should be noted that the incidence of cardiovascular AEs was higher 
in those patients with a previous history of cardiac failure treated with enzalutamide. However, this 
higher incidence would be expected. Moreover, ischemic heart disease has been included in section 4.8 
of the SmPC as a common AE, and included as an important identified risk in the RMP. 
The incidence of AEs of any grade was higher in patients from North America compared to patients 
from Europe and patients from the rest of the world (91.5% vs. 85.3% vs. 87.1%, respectively) 
whereas the frequency of SAEs was lower in that subgroup of patients and no great differences were 
observed in the incidence of grade 3 or higher AEs.  
Treatment discontinuations as well as dose reductions or dose interruptions were relatively low in the 
enzalutamide group (9.4%; 10.1% and 15.4%, respectively), although higher than in the placebo 
group (6.0%; 2.8% and 8.6%). The most common AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were 
fatigue (1.6%), MI (0.4%), cardiac failure, cerebrovascular accident and nausea (0.3%, each). Overall, 
enzalutamide seems to be well tolerated. 
The safety profile of enzalutamide in the study MDV3100-14 is in line with the known safety profile of 
enzalutamide. Compared with previous clinical trials, in which most of the patients had metastatic 
disease, a lower incidence of AEs of any grade, grade ≥ 3 AEs and SAEs were reported in the 
enzalutamide group in study MDV3100-14. However, regarding study drug-related AEs and grade ≥ 3 
AEs incidence, no differences were observed.

2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, enzalutamide seems to be well tolerated. The safety profile of enzalutamide in patients with 
nonmetastatic castration resistant prostate cancer appears similar to that reported in previous clinical 
trials, with no major safety concerns. Relevant information is reflected in the SmPC.

“Ischemic heart disease” was identified as a new safety concern as part of this extension of indication. 
Data from the studies supportive of the new indication showed a higher incidence of ischemic heart 
disease events between enzalutamide and placebo-treated patients. Due to the clinical significance of 
ischemic heart disease events and causal relationship ischemic heart disease was added as an 
important identified risk. 
Some of the existing important identified risks and missing information were removed from the list of 
safety concerns as a result of the transition to the new RMP template revision 2 in accordance with the 
new GVP module V. 
Pharmacovigilance plan  
No additional pharmacovigilance activities were requested as a result of the new indication. 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities remain sufficient to mitigate the safety concerns of Xtandi.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 5.1 and 5.3 of the SmPC have been updated.  
In addition, following the review of the clinical studies results, sections 4.4, 4.5, 4.7, 4.8, 5.2 and 6.6 
of the SmPC were updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the 
representative(s). 
Please refer to attachment 1 for the full detail of the Product Information updates. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Xtandi 40 mg and 80 mg film-coated tablets. The 
bridging report submitted by the MAH has been found acceptable.  
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
This extension of indication is for the treatment of adult men with high-risk non-metastatic castration-
resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (PSADT ≤10 months). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current treatment options are limited. Although continued use of ADT is part of clinical practice, no 
therapy is approved specifically for the treatment of patients with nonmetastatic CRPC or for 
prevention of metastasis, and patients are encouraged to participate in clinical studies. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Efficacy data in support of this application focus on data from trial MDV3100-14 (PROSPER): A 
multinational, phase 3, randomized, double-blind trial in which Enzalutamide (160 mg once daily) 
Assessment report  
EMA/41918/2019 
Page 82/90 
 
 
  
 
 
administered add-on to ADT was compared to ADT plus placebo in a total of 1401 men (2:1) with non-
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) who had rapidly rising PSA (PSA doubling time 
≤ 10 months). 1401 patients were randomised in at 2:1 proportion. All patients had a short PSADT 
(stratified for <6 months or > 6 months but <10 months). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Results from PROSPER trial in the efficacy target population of patients at the cut-off date of 28-June-
2016 included the main analysis planned for MFS (BIRC assessed) and the first interim analysis for OS 
(2 IA planned plus 1 final analysis). 
With an event rate of 23.5% and 48.7% for enzalutamide and placebo arms respectively, a statistically 
significant improvement in MFS was observed for enzalutamide compared to placebo (HR: 0.292; 95% 
CI: 0.241, 0.352). The median MFS (95% CI) was 36.6 months (95% CI: 33.1, NR) in the 
enzalutamide group and 14.7 months (95% CI: 14.2, 15.0) in the placebo group (Δ 21.9 months). A 
reduction in both bone metastases and soft tissue metastases was observed among patients treated 
with enzalutamide compared to placebo. These results are supported by several sensitivity analyses as 
well as by subgroups analyses. 
Overall, key secondary endpoints showed consistency with primary efficacy outcomes. Treatment with 
enzalutamide delayed time to PSA progression (HR:0.066; 95% CI: 0.054, 0.081) and time to first use 
of new antineoplastic treatment (HR:0.208; 95% CI: 0.168, 0.258). OS data, still immature at the 
time of the second IA (31 May 2018) so as to draw any firm conclusion (event rate 19.7% and 22.2% 
in enzalutamide and placebo arms respectively), did not cross the boundary for statistical significance 
(HR= 0.832, 95% CI: 0.654, 1.059) and no clear separation of the survival curves is observed. 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints included to provide additional evidence of clinical benefit (need for 
First Use of Cytotoxic Chemotherapy, Chemotherapy-Free Disease-Specific Survival, Chemotherapy-
Free Survival) though still immature in some cases, all supported primary efficacy results but time to 
pain progression (HR:0.959; 95% CI: 0.801, 0.1.149). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There is uncertainty related to the long-term effects of enzalutamide on Overall Survival and relevant 
secondary endpoints. A post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES) in order to investigate the long-term 
effects of enzalutamide on Overall Survival and relevant secondary endpoints in adult men with high-
risk non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The MAH should submit the results of the 
MDV3100-14 (PROSPER) efficacy study. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, enzalutamide was well tolerated, since the number of discontinuations as well as dose 
modifications were relatively low. The safety profile of enzalutamide was in line with the already known 
safety profile, with no major differences compared to previous clinical trials in terms of the incidence 
and severity of AEs. 
The overall incidence of AEs in the enzalutamide group was 86.9% (compared to 77.4 in the placebo 
group), 62.4% of whom were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug. The most 
commonly reported AEs were fatigue (32.6%), hot flush (13.0%), hypertension (11.9%), nausea 
(11.4%), fall (11.4%), dizziness (9.8%), decreased appetite (9.6%), constipation (9.1%), headache 
(9.1%), asthenia (8.8%) and weight decreased (5.9%). Exposure to treatment was longer with 
Assessment report  
EMA/41918/2019 
Page 83/90 
 
 
  
enzalutamide compared to placebo. When adjusted for the duration of treatment, fatigue, decreased 
appetite and hypertension were higher in the enzalutamide group. 
Grade ≥  3 were reported in 31.4% of patients treated with enzalutamide. Hypertension (4.6% 
enzalutamide vs. 2.2% placebo), fatigue (2.9% vs. 0.6%), syncope (1.1% vs. 0.4%), fall (1.3% vs. 
0.6%), asthenia (1.2% vs. 0.2%) and pneumonia (1.1% vs. 0.4%) were grade≥  3 AEs more frequent 
(≥  0.5% higher incidence) in the enzalutamide group than in the placebo group. 
AEs considered of special interest reported during study MDV3100-14 include seizure, cognitive and 
memory impairment, neutrophil count decreased, hypertension, fatigue, cardiovascular events, hepatic 
impairment, second primary malignancies, falls, fractures, syncope and renal impairment. 
SAEs were reported in 24.3% of patients in the enzalutamide group, although only in 3.4% of patients 
that received enzalutamide SAEs were considered related to study drug by the investigator. 
Haematuria and pneumonia were the only SAEs reported in ≥ 1%.  
Treatment discontinuations as well as dose reductions or dose interruptions were relatively low in the 
enzalutamide group (9.4% vs. 10.1% vs. 15.4%, respectively). The most common AEs leading to 
treatment discontinuation were fatigue (1.6%), MI (0.4%), cardiac failure, cerebrovascular accident 
and nausea (0.3%, each). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
A higher event rate of second primary malignancies has been reported in patients treated with 
enzalutamide compared to placebo (2.1 enzalutamide vs. 1.0 placebo), which is in line with data from 
previous clinical trials with enzalutamide. Enzalutamide has shown to be carcinogenic in non-clinical 
trials (related to urinary bladder carcinogenicity). The relevance of these findings in humans is 
unknown, but the potential risk of enzalutamide to develop second primary malignancies cannot be 
ruled out, also considering the longer exposure expected in the new proposed indication in patients 
with non metastatic castration-resistant cancer. Relevant information has been included in section 5.3 
of the SmPC. A signal will be triggered to further study these pre-clinical findings and relevance for 
human use.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Results in terms of OS failed to show any statistically significant result and data are still rather 
immature so as to firmly conclude about a survival benefit. However, the positive trend observed in 
this latter variable seems to rule out a detrimental effect. The rest of the variables provide additional 
evidence of clinical benefit (need for First Use of Cytotoxic Chemotherapy, Chemotherapy-Free 
Disease-Specific Survival, Chemotherapy-Free Survival) even though the immaturity of some of these 
data preclude to draw firm conclusions. All in all, there is no doubt that from a patient perspective, the 
fact of delaying the onset of metastases represents a value in itself, which may postpone the expected 
symptomatology associated to the metastatic setting. The latter is also deemed valuable in the frame 
of a non-curable disease where the increase in the time to progression should be weighed against the 
toxicity of the treatment. However, the optimal use of enzalutamide in the course of castration-
resistant prostate cancer remains unknown.

Despite that a clear statistically significant reduction in terms of MFS was demonstrated in the pivotal 
trial, there was no unequivocal impact on overall quality of life, as indicated by patient reported 
outcomes. Therefore, clinical benefit in this regard must be assumed from the nature of the primary 
endpoint (delaying the onset of symptoms and likely deterioration of quality of life as well as the need 
for more aggressive treatments in the metastatic setting), in the absence of more mature OS data or 
alternatively in terms of relief of disease symptomatology (time to pain progression) or delaying the 
time to chemotherapy. 
Overall, in the absence of detrimental toxicity or marked decrease in quality of life due to treatment 
before development of metastases, delaying metastatic disease by a considerable amount is a valid 
objective of therapy and that this endpoint is indicative of clinical benefit per se. 
The safety profile of enzalutamide in the treatment of non-metastatic CRPC patients who had rapidly 
rising PSA, was in line with the already known safety profile, with no major differences compared to 
previous clinical trials in terms of the incidence and severity of AEs. Overall, enzalutamide was well 
tolerated. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
To date, no therapy is currently approved for progression from nonmetastatic to metastatic CRPC. The 
current clinical guidelines include watchful waiting as one of the strategies in this setting, reflecting the 
absence of any treatments having been proven valuable. 
Results from PROSPER trial are considered to demonstrate a clinically and statistically significant 
advantage in terms of MFS for patients with high-risk non-metastatic CRPC, without indications of a 
detrimental effect on overall survival, whereas the safety profile of enzalutamide was acceptable. The 
benefit-risk balance was concluded to be positive. The finally approved indication was restricted to 
more accurately reflect the high-risk M0 CRPC population. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
There is uncertainty related to how the introduction of enzalutamide prior to development of 
metastasis could influence in later lines (cross-resistance). Although PFS2 data could shed some light 
in this issue, this was not included as endpoint in the pivotal trial. It remains unknown whether the 
best use of enzalutamide is in the present line of therapy or rather in later lines, where an OS benefit 
has been shown. However, determining the optimal sequencing of available agents throughout the 
course of the disease is a complex task that falls outside the scope of this marketing authorisation. 
Such studies are encouraged. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The Benefit/risk for enzalutamide in the treatment of high-risk non-metastatic castration resistant 
prostate cancer is positive. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
A post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES) in order to investigate the long-term effects of enzalutamide 
on Overall Survival and relevant secondary endpoints in adult men with high-risk non-metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer. The MAH should submit the results of the MDV3100-14 
(PROSPER) efficacy study.

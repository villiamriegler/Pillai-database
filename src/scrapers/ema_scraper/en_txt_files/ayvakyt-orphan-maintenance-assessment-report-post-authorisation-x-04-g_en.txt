2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2018 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing avapritinib was 
considered justified based on preliminary non-clinical data showing improved survival as well as 
preliminary clinical data showing an improvement in overall response rate; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to symptoms such as flushing, tachycardia, pruritus, 
abdominal cramping, peptic ulcers and diarrhoea, and life-threatening due to bone marrow failure, 
hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and poor survival with 5-year rates of around 60% in patients with 
systemic mastocytosis; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 3 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made;  
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition exist in the European Union, the 
sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal product 
containing avapritinib will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The sponsor 
has provided preliminary clinical data which demonstrate an improved overall response rate 
compared to the current approved medicine. The Committee considered that this constitutes a 
clinically relevant advantage. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
type II variation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Mastocytosis is a rare disease characterized by abnormal expansion and accumulation of tissue mast 
cells (MC) in one or multiple organs. Most adult patients with mastocytosis are diagnosed with 
systemic mastocytosis (SM). Based on histopathological findings and organ damage, SM is divided into 
indolent SM (ISM), smoldering SM (SSM), SM with an associated hematologic non-MC-lineage disease 
(SM-AHNMD), aggressive SM (ASM), and MC leukaemia (MCL). The clinical course and prognosis vary 
greatly among these groups of patients. In all variants of SM and most patients, neoplastic cells 
display the KIT mutation D816V. This suggests that additional KIT-independent molecular defects 
cause progression. Indeed, additional oncogenic lesions, including RAS- and TET2 mutations, have 
recently been identified in advanced SM. In patients with SM-AHNMD, such additional lesions are often 
detectable in the ‘AHNMD component’ of the disease. Clinically relevant symptoms of SM result from i) 
malignant MC infiltration and the subsequent organ damage seen in advanced SM and/or ii) the release 
of pro-inflammatory and vasoactive mediators from MC, found in all disease-variants. (Am J Cancer 
Res 2013;3(2):159-172)  
This condition continues to be acceptable for orphan regulatory purposes.

The approved therapeutic indication “AYVAKYT is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult 
patients with aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM), systemic mastocytosis with an associated 
haematological neoplasm (SM-AHN) or mast cell leukaemia (MCL), after at least one systemic therapy” 
falls within the scope of the designated orphan condition “treatment of mastocytosis.” 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP, see 
EPAR. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
The sponsor claims that since the application for orphan designation of avapritinib for the treatment of 
mastocytosis, the treatment paradigm for AdvSM has not changed, and patients with AdvSM have 
limited treatment options.  
Mastocytosis carry substantial morbidity and mortality.  Cutaneous Mastocytosis has a good prognosis 
in most cases (Valent 2005).  It occurs mainly in children, often regresses during puberty, and rarely 
progresses to SM.  In adults however, cutaneous mastocytosis is persistent and often progresses to 
SM, or it can have an associated haematologic disorder, such as hypereosinophilic syndrome that may 
become aggressive (Pottier 2003, Valent 2005).  
Mediator-release symptoms of flushing, tachycardia, pruritus, abdominal cramping, peptic ulcer 
disease, and diarrhoea can be difficult to control, can seriously impact the quality of life of patients 
experiencing these symptoms, and can be life-threatening (Castells 2002, Valent 2005).  Infiltration of 
various organs by malignant cells in aggressive forms SM cause the “C-findings” of cytopenias, 
osteoporosis, pathologic fractures, hepatomegaly with ascites and impaired liver function, 
splenomegaly with hypersplenism, malabsorption, hypoalbuminemia, weight loss, or life-threatening 
organopathy in other organ systems (O'Brien 2004). 
The prognosis for CM and ISM is excellent, as reported by Lim et al. in 2009. Indeed, patients with ISM 
in the USA have much the same life expectancy as the general population. However, the prognosis is 
poor for AdvSM, especially in elderly patients: median OS was 41 months for ASM, 24 months for SM-
AHN, and 2 months for MCL in the aforementioned study reported by Lim et al. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
European estimates of incidence and prevalence for mastocytosis that were used by the sponsor were 
obtained through a systematic search of published literature and relevant EU databases. This search 
included published literature until 15 November 2020. 
The publications on the prevalence are summarised in the following tables:

Table 3.  Studies reporting on the number of cases of mastocytosis in the EU. 
The sponsor highlights a paucity of data on the prevalence and incidence of mastocytosis in the EU. 
Only four data sources were identified for prevalence. Cohen et al (2014) estimate the 14-year 
prevalence of mastocytosis to be 0.959 (0.873-0.105) per 10,000 in Denmark. Kibsgaard et al (2020) 
estimated ISM prevalence in Denmark to be at 1.8 cases per 10,000. In the Netherlands, Van 
Doormaal et al (2013) estimate SM prevalence to be 1.3 per 10,000. Schwaab et al (2020) estimated 
the prevalence of AdvSM to be 0.053 per 10,000 in Germany. The four studies differ in terms of the 
type of SM covered. Cohen covers all types of SM (including Urticaria Pigmentosa:UP), whereas those 
presented in the Kibsgaard, Van Doormaal and Schwaab studies focus on ISM, ISM and SSM, and 
AdvSM, respectively. The Cohen and Van Doormaal studies were conducted in subjects aged 15 years 
and older, while the Kibsgaard and Schwaab studies included patients of all ages. With the exception of 
UP in Cohen et al, the other studies did not present prevalence for CM.  
Additional prevalence estimates were obtained from incidence data. A prevalence of 2.43 cases of CM 
per 10,000 was estimated based on incidence data from Italy, including subjects of all ages (D’Inca et 
al, 1996). Similarly, Danish incidence data for subjects of all ages resulted in an estimated CM 
prevalence of 6.08 per 10,000 and an overall mastocytosis prevalence of 8.91 per 10,000 (Kibsgaard 
et al, 2020). For Hungary (Marton et al, 2016), the prevalence estimated 1.68 cases of SM per 10,000. 
These calculated prevalences may be overestimates given the conservative method used for their 
calculation, as showcased previously with the examples from Kibsgaard et al (2020), Cohen et al 
(2014) and Schwaab et al (2020). The prevalence estimates reported in Cohen et al (2014), Kibsgaard

et al (2020) and Van Doormaal et al (2013) were considered to be the most robust by the sponsor, 
despite two not including children or the full spectrum of CM. The sponsor states that Brockow (2014) 
expressed the view that Van Doormaal’s finding is comparable to other estimates. He states that at the 
consensus meeting of mastocytosis experts in Boston in 2010, a general cumulative prevalence of 
approximately 1 in 10,000 persons was estimated by other centers (Luis Escribano, Patrizia 
Bonadonna, personal communication in Brockow (2014). Valent (2013) states that the estimated 
prevalence of mastocytosis in “Middle Europe” is 0.5-1 per 10,000. These estimates are in line with the 
findings in original studies from the literature.  
The COMP accepted the final prevalence estimate of less than 3 in 10,000 proposed by the sponsor. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
Cimetidine is authorized for use in systemic mastocytosis in Portugal: profilaxia das úlceras de stress 
em doentes graves com risco de hemorragia; no tratamento de hipersecreção patológica, 
nomeadamente síndrome de Zollinger-Ellison, mastocitose sistémica e adenomas endócrinos múltiplos; 
como medida de suporte, no tratamento da hemorragia digestiva altapor úlcera péptica ou erosões (in 
English:
prophylaxis of stress ulcers in critically ill patients at risk of bleeding; in the treatment of 
pathological hypersecretion, namely Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, systemic mastocytosis and multiple 
endocrine adenomas; as a supportive measure in the treatment of upper gastrointestinal bleeding from 
peptic ulcer or erosions). 
As cimetidine has a therapeutic indication limited to “treatment of upper gastrointestinal bleeding from 
peptic ulcers or erosions” the indication does not fully overlap with the one for Ayvakyt and therefore 
cimetidine is not considered a satisfactory method for the target patient population of Ayvakyt and 
does not have to be considered for the purpose of significant benefit. 
Midostaurin is the only product authorized centrally in Europe for mastocytosis and has the following 
indication: Rydapt is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with aggressive 
systemic mastocytosis (ASM), systemic mastocytosis with associated haematological neoplasm (SM-
AHN), or mast cell leukaemia (MCL).  
The therapeutic indication overlaps with the one sought for Ayvakyt and midostaurin can therefore be 
considered a satisfactory method to treat this target patient population. 
There are no specific European Guidelines in the treatment of these patients and many products are 
used off-label in the treatment of this condition. Some guidance regarding treatment algorithm is 
proposed in Pardani Am J Hematol 2019;94:363–377. This is summarized below.

Significant benefit 
The  sponsor’s  target  population  is  defined  by  the  following  indication:  AYVAKYT  is  indicated  as 
monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM), systemic 
mastocytosis with an associated haematological neoplasm (SM-AHN) or mast cell leukaemia (MCL), after 
at least one systemic therapy.   
Initial Scientific Advice from the CHMP regarding the SM program for avapritinib was received on 31 May 
2018 (procedure EMEA/H/SA/3738/2/2018/SME/III). Later, Simultaneous National Scientific Advice was 
obtained  from  the  Spanish  Agency  of  Medicines  and  Medical  Products  and  the  Norwegian  Medicines 
Agency  for  a  planned  external-control,  observational,  retrospective  study  (BLU-285-2405).  But  no 
discussion on the significant benefit with the COMP was held. 
The  sponsor  argues  a  significant  benefit  over  midostaurin  based  on  a  clinically  relevant  advantage  in 
patients who have already been pretreated with at least one prior systemic therapy (midostaurin). The 
avapritinib patient population from studies BLU-285-2101 and BLU 285-2202 received at least one prior 
systemic therapy, in contrast to the midostaurin study population (D2201 FAS), in which more than half 
of patients received no prior systemic therapy. 
The sponsor has provided data from two uncontrolled single arm studies in patients with AdvSM, which 
are also the basis for the benefit risk assessment: the Phase 1 study BLU-285-2101 in pretreated patients 
and Phase 2 study BLU-285-2202 in naïve and pretreated patients.   
For the purpose of significant benefit the sponsor provided data of a subset of patients who were 
relapsed or refractory to prior midostaurin treatment. This is summarised below.  
Avapritinib in AdvSM patients with prior midostaurin treatment.  
The ORR of avapritinib in AdvSM patients who had received prior midostaurin and a starting dose of up 
to and including 200 mg was 76.0% (19 of 25 patients; 95% confidence interval: 54.9, 90.6), 
including 2 patients (8.0%) with CR, 4 patients (16.0%) with CRh, and 10 patients (40.0%) with PR 
(Table 4).  
In the Response Adjudication Committee-Response evaluable (RAC-RE) population with prior 
midostaurin, the median DOR is currently not available. The sponsor however, reports that after a 
median follow-up of 20.9 months, 3 of the 19 patients had a DOR event (progressive disease/loss of 
response (LoR) or death due to any cause) at the time of data cut off. The data further demonstrate 
that avapritinib provides an alternative in patients with AdvSM who no longer respond to midostaurin 
and for whom there are no other medicinal treatment options.

treated with midostaurin (Original application population, Pooled BLU-285-2101 + BLU-285-2202, 
RAC-RE population, starting dose up to and including 200 mg of avapritinib). 
As shown in Table 5 below, the ORR of avapritinib in patients previously treated with midostaurin is not 
significantly different from the ORR seen in patients not previously treated with midostaurin or any 
other AdvSM population, regardless of prior therapies, support sequential therapies with TKIs in 
AdvSM, e.g. avapritinib after midostaurin or after at least one other therapy.

(Original application population, Pooled BLU-285-2101 + BLU-285-2202, RAC-RE population, starting 
dose up to and including 200 mg of avapritinib). 
The efficacy demonstrated in Study BLU-285-2202 in AdvSM patients with at least one prior systemic 
therapy, including those who have been previously treated with midostaurin, supports a clinically 
relevant advantage of avapritinib in the AdvSM patient population. 
This was accepted as the basis of significant benefit.

4.  COMP position adopted on 2 February 2022 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product. 
the prevalence of mastocytosis (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to remain 
below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be less than 3 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, 
at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to symptoms such as flushing, tachycardia, pruritus, 
abdominal cramping, peptic ulcers and diarrhoea, and life-threatening due to bone marrow failure, 
hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and poor survival with 5-year rates of around 60% in patients with 
systemic mastocytosis; 
although satisfactory methods for the Treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the assumption that Ayvakyt may be of potential significant benefit in patients 
who have relapsed or refractory aggressive systemic mastocytosis still holds. Clinically relevant 
responses were observed in patients who failed one prior systemic therapy. The COMP considered 
that the product offers a clinically relevant advantage.  
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Avyakyt, avapritinib, for 
treatment of mastocytosis (EU/3/18/2074) is not removed from the Community Register of Orphan 
Medicinal Products.

Lenalidomide  has  a  pleiotropic  mechanism  of  action that  is  cell-type  and  context  dependent,  suggesting 
modulation  of  multiple  biochemical  pathways.  Lenalidomide  physically  associates  with  cereblon,  a 
component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Cereblon-mediated mechanisms at least partially explain the 
pleiotropic effects of lenalidomide, including inhibition of tumour cell proliferation, induction of tumour cell 
apoptosis, and activation of immune effector cells observed in multiple myeloma (MM).

About the disease 
Multiple  myeloma  (MM)  accounts  for  about  10%  to  18%  of  haematologic  malignancies  (Moreau,  2017; 
Siegel, 2018). It is a disease of the elderly (San Miguel, 2013a), with an overall median age at manifestation 
of  approximately  72  years  (Moreau,  2017).  The  number  of  MM  patients  is  increasing  in  the  general 
population due to aging populations and more patients living longer due to modern drugs (Turesson, 2018). 
The prevalence of MM varies from c ountry to country in the European Union (EU). Overall, the estimated 
prevalence of MM in the EU in 2018 ranges from 1.79 to 3.61 in 10,000 persons. In Europe, 38,900 new 
cases of MM and 24,300 deaths due to MM were estimated in 2012 (Ferlay, 2013). 
Multiple myeloma is a B-cell neoplasm that stems from the malignant transformation of plasma cells and is 
characterized  by  the  accumulation  of  clonal  plasma  cells  in  the  bone  marrow  (Kumar,  2018;  Palumbo, 
2011). The malignant proliferation of the plasma cell clone causes increasing levels of monoclonal protein 
(M-protein)  in  the  serum  and  urine  and  may  result  in  bone  marrow  failure,  suppression  of  uninvolved 
immunoglobulin levels, and skeletal destruction. Clinical complications of progressive MM include recurrent 
infections,  cytopenias,  renal  failure,  hyperviscosity  syndrome,  hypercalcemia,  bone  pain,  and  pathologic 
fractures (Munshi, 2012). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Multiple myeloma typically is detected when reviewing results of routine blood work or by characteristic 
symptoms (eg, bone pain, fatigue, and weight loss) (Girnius, 2013). The International Myeloma Working 
Group (IMWG) criteria for the diagnosis of MM require the following: 1) the presence of serum and/or urinary 
M-protein (in patients without detectable M-protein, an abnormal free light-chain ratio), 2) bone marrow 
plasma  cells  >  10%,  and  3)  evidence  of  end-organ  damage  attributable  to  plasma  cell  proliferation 
(including hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia, or bone lesions) according to the CRAB2 criteria (Durie, 
2006).  The  IMWG  guidelines  were  subsequently  updated  to  include  any  one  or  more  of  the  following 
biomarkers  of  malignancy  as  a  myeloma-defining  event:  clonal  bone  marrow  plasma  cell  percentage  ≥ 
60%, involved/uninvolved serum free light chain ratio ≥ 100, and > 1 focal lesion on magnetic resonance 
imaging  studies  (Rajkumar,  2014).  The  presence  of  at  least  one  of  the  CRAB  criteria  distinguishes 
symptomatic  MM  from  smoldering  (asymptomatic)  MM.  Symptomatic  MM  generally  requires  treatment 
(Durie, 2006; Kyle, 2009a). 
Management 
Despite the introduction of therapeutic options with new mechanisms of action and a better understanding 
of  the  disease  biology,  MM  is  not  curable  with  current  therapies.  Multiple  Myeloma  is  a  heterogeneous 
disease  with  a  highly  variable  clinical  course  (Avet-Loiseau,  2013;  Moreau,  2017).  Most  patients  still 
experience  disease  relapse  and  require  several  lines  of  therapy  (Agarwal,  2017;  Larocca,  2017;  van  de 
Velde, 2017; Yong, 2016). The course of MM is characterized by subsequently shorter periods of remission 
and relapse following sequential lines of treatment (Agarwal, 2017; Larocca, 2017; Moreau, 2017). Thus, 
first-line therapy is generally accepted to be of primary importance in providing long-term benefits for MM 
patients (Mateos, 2015). Furthermore, many patients only receive 1 or at most 2 lines of treatment (Raab, 
2016; Willenbacher, 2018; Yong, 2016). Thus, all patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) 
should receive the most effective therapy available upfront. 
For  patients  with  NDMM,  the  choice  of  initial  therapy  is  determined  by  the  patient’s  age,  fitness/frailty 
status, and the presence of comorbidities, and thus the ability to undergo autologous hematopoietic stem 
cell  transplantation  (auto-HSCT)  (Kumar,  2018;  Ludwig,  2014;  Moreau,  2017),  as  well  the  differing 
availability of treatment options within each EU member state. 
The determinant for auto-HSCT eligibility is shifting from chronological age to biological age/fitness. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/232212/2019 
Page 7/82 
 
  
  
current European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) MM guidelines recommend auto-HSCT for patients < 
65  years  or  fit  patients  <  70  years  in  good  clinical  condition  (Moreau,  2017).  Similarly,  the  European 
Myeloma  Network  (EMN)  guideline  for  transplant-eligible  (TE)  MM  patients  recommends  auto-HSCT  for 
non-frail  patients  <  65  years;  auto-HSCT  should  still  be  considered  for  patients  ≥  65  years  who  have 
reduced performance status (PS) or comorbidities when the benefit of transplant outweighs the risk (Gay, 
2018). The recently published EMN guidelines for elderly MM patients note that non-frail, elderly MM patients 
up to the age of 70 years (or even 75 years) without prohibitive comorbidities and adequate organ function 
may benefit from high-dose melphalan (HDM) followed by auto-ASCT (Larocca, 2018). Consistent with the 
recommendation in MM guidelines, a more individualized approach is currently being used in routine clinical 
practice. 
High-dose  therapy  followed  by  auto-HSCT  has  demonstrated  superior  outcomes  compared  with  other 
options and is the treatment of choice for patients with NDMM, provided they are eligible. The goal of initial 
treatment in TE patients with NDMM is to achieve the deepest and longest possible first remission while 
ensuring  that  patients  can  proceed  to  stem  cell  collection  and  auto-HSCT  (Multiple  Myeloma  Research 
Foundation, 2017). The depth of response needed to achieve optimal long-term disease control is an area of 
active investigation. The rates of complete response (CR) and very good partial response (VGPR) remain 
important prognostic indicators of long-term outcome in patients with NDMM (Harousseau, 2007, 2009). To 
allow subsequent stem cell collection, a further important consideration is the choice of agents without stem 
cell toxicity (ie, a melphalan-free combination). 
More recent studies using more sensitive methods of disease detection have demonstrated that MM patients 
who  achieve  minimal  residual  disease  (MRD)-negative  status  following  initial  treatment  have  improved 
progression-free  survival  (PFS)  and  overall  survival  (OS)  compared  with  those  who  do  not  achieve 
MRD-negative status, further demonstrating the importance of a deep response (Lahuerta, 2017; Landgren, 
2016a; Martinez-Lopez, 2014a; Munshi, 2017; Paiva, 2008, 2011a; Puig, 2014; Rawstron, 2013, 2015). As 
a result, IMWG has included MRD in the most recent criteria for response (Kumar, 2016). Ongoing strategies 
to deepen response also include use of triplet or quadruplet regimens (if tolerable). 
Treatment  of  MM  has  changed  substantially  during  the  last  10  to  15  years,  predominantly  due  to  the 
introduction  of  bortezomib,  lenalidomide,  and  thalidomide  (San-Miguel,  2017).  In  the  last  5  years,  6 
additional  therapies  for  MM  have  been  approved  for  the  treatment  of  relapsed  or  refractory  multiple 
myeloma (RRMM). This has been associated with a steady improvement in clinical outcomes, including the 
duration of survival (Bergin, 2017; San-Miguel, 2017). 
In  the  TE  NDMM  setting,  bortezomib  is  authorized  in  combination  with  dexamethasone  (VD)  or  with 
thalidomide and dexamethasone (VTD) as initial treatment for adult patients with previously untreated MM 
who are eligible for transplant. In addition, lenalidomide is authorized for the maintenance treatment of 
adult patients with NDMM who have undergone autologous stem cell transplant. 
In  the  TNE  NDMM  setting,  the  below  drugs  are  authorized  as  initial  treatment:  1)  lenalidomide  in 
combination  with  dexamethasone  (Rd)  or  lenalidomide  in  combination  with  melphalan  and  prednisone 
followed  by  lenalidomide  for  maintenance  (MPR+R),  2)  bortezomib  in  combination  with  melphalan  and 
prednisone is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who 
are  not  eligible  for  high  dose  chemotherapy  with  haematopoietic  stem  cell  transplantation  and  3) 
thalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone is indicated as first line treatment of patients 
with untreated multiple myeloma, aged ≥ 65 years or ineligible for high dose chemotherapy.  
As new treatment options become available, with the promise of achieving deeper responses during initial 
therapy, the guidelines for the treatment of MM continue to evolve. A summary of treatment options that are 
currently  recommended  for  patients  with  NDMM  by  the  ESMO  (Moreau,  2017),  EMN  (Engelhardt,  2014 
[TNE];  Gay,  2018  [TE];  Larocca,  2018  [elderly]);  and  National  Comprehensive  Cancer  Network  (NCCN; 
Kumar, 2018) is presented in next table.

a The EMN guideline for elderly NDMM patients (Larocca, 2018) recommends treatment based on patient fitness level: 
full-dose regimens for fit patients (ASCT, VMP, VRD, Rd), full-dose doublet (Rd, Vd) or reduced-dose triplet regimens 
for patients with intermediate fitness, and reduced-dose doublet regimens (rd, vd) or palliative + supportive care for frail 
patients.

The current indication for Revlimid is the following: 
Multiple myeloma 
Revlimid as monotherapy is indicated for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed 
multiple myeloma who have undergone autologous stem cell transplantation. 
Revlimid  as  combination  therapy  (see  section  4.2)  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with 
previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for transplant. 
Revlimid in combination with dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of multiple myeloma in adult 
patients who have received at least one prior therapy.

(N) 
An updated Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) for lenalidomide was provided which covers the following: 
diffuse  large  B-cell  lymphoma,  follicular  lymphoma,  mantle  cell  lymphoma,  marginal  zone  lymphoma, 
multiple myeloma, and myelodysplastic syndromes. 
The  partition  coefficient  (n-octanol/water)  for  lenalidomide  was  experimentally  determined  at  several 
concentrations  and  pH  values.  The  resulting  logKow  for  lenalidomide  was  -0.34  at  pH  4.5-7.5  from  a 
non-GLP non-guideline study (Celgene, 2003) and -0.6 (pH 4) and -0.5 (pH 7 and 9) in a GLP compliant 
OECD 107 study (Ciric, 2016).  
As the logKow for lenalidomide is below the trigger of 4.5, a PBT assessment is not required. Based on the 
logKow of -0.5 and the structural formula, a BCF was estimated using BCFBAF of EPIWEB 4.11. The resulting 
estimated value for lenalidomide was 3.2 L/kg wwt (logBCF = 0.5). 
Calculation of the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) 
In Phase I, the PEC calculation is restricted to the aquatic compartment. The calculation of the PEC in surface 
water  further  assumes  that  the  predicted  amount  used  per  year is  evenly  distributed over  the  year  and 
throughout the geographic area, the sewage system is the main route of entry, there is no biodegradation or

retention of the drug substance in the sewage treatment plant (STP) and metabolism in the patient is not 
taken into account. Thus, a PEC is only calculated for the active substance (the parent compound or the 
active metabolite for prodrugs).  
PECSURFACEWATER (expressed in mg/L) is calculated as

In a summary of the IQVIA 21 May 2018 (IQVIA, 2018) report the Sponsor indicates a prevalence value for 
MM of 36.1/100,000 be utilized. 
The calculation of Fpen per indication is: 
Table 2 : Calculation of refined Fpen per indication 
The PEC surface water has been calculated for lenalidomide in each disease: 
multiple myeloma: 0.0034 µg/L 
myelodysplastic syndromes: 0.00034 µg/l 
mantle cell lymphoma: 0.000033 µg/l 
follicular lymphoma: 0.0021 µg/l 
marginal zone lymphoma: 0.00052 µg/l 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: 0.00028 µg/l 
The  total  PECSURFACEWATER  of  lenalidomide  for  all  indications  in  Phase  I  is  the  sum  of  the  6  separate 
PECSURFACEWATER values and amounts to 0.0069 μg/L. 
Action Limits 
Based  on  the  calculated  market  penetration  factors  for  MM,  MDS,  MCL,  FL,  MZL  and  DLBCL  and  the 
maximum daily doses per indication, the total PECSURFACEWATER of lenalidomide is 0.0069 μg/L and thus below 
the action limit of 0.01 μg/L. A Phase II environmental assessment is not triggered.

2.2.2.  Discussion and conclusions on non-clinical aspects 
The  Applicant  provided  an  updated  ERA  for  lenalidomide  in  diffuse  large  B-cell  lymphoma,  follicular 
lymphoma,  mantle  cell  lymphoma,  marginal  zone  lymphoma,  multiple  myeloma,  and  myelodysplastic 
syndromes. The logkow was experimentally determined and was inferior to 4.5 which does not require a PBT 
assessment. 
The Applicant has refined the Fpen for each indication based on refined prevalence data and calculated the 
corresponding PECsurface water. The sum of the PECsurfacewater for the 6 indications is 0.0069µg/l. The Phase I 
PECSURFACEWATER of lenalidomide does not exceed the action limit of 0.01μg/L, so a Phase II environmental 
fate and effects assessment is not triggered. The intended medicinal uses of lenalidomide are considered to 
be of low risk to the environment, according to current guidelines.  
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of Lenalidomide.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
The recommended starting dose is lenalidomide 25 mg orally once daily on either: a) days 1-14 of each 
21-day cycle or b) days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle. Bortezomib should be administered via subcutaneous 
injection (1.3 mg/m2 body surface area) twice weekly on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of each 21-day or 28-day 
cycle. 
This recommended dose and schedule is per the RVd arms of the SWOG S0777, PETHEMA GEM2012, and 
IFM 2009 studies. The continued Rd dosing is consistent with the recommended dosing of Rd until disease 
progression in the current EU SmPC. 
The applicant’s rationale for RVd in study SWOG S0777 was based on the results of a Phase 1, dose-finding 
study of lenalidomide plus bortezomib in 17 subjects with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) 
that had been reported, including subjects who had failed with each agent separately; the response rate 
(complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) was 59% (Richardson, 2005). Preliminary data from a 
Phase 1/2 study in 33 subjects with NDMM suggested that the triplet therapy of bortezomib, lenalidomide, 
and dexamethasone was active and well tolerated in subjects with NDMM (Richardson, 2007). 
The  rationale  for  study  PETHEMA  GEM2012  is  that  the  combination  RVd  has  been  shown  to  be  highly 
effective  as  induction  treatment  in  previous  Phase  2  trials  (Richardson,  2010;  Roussel,  2010)  (using  a 
21-day cycle regimen), which was the basis for its use in this Phase 3 clinical trial. 
For study IFM2009, the choice of RVd was based on the results from DFCI (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute) 
team with 100% PR and 74% VGPR (Richardson, 2007; Richardson, 2008, Roussel, 2014).

a For the purpose of comparison to the PETHEMA GEM2012 and SWOG S0777 studies, the 8 cycles (24 weeks) of initial RVd therapy for Arm A in 
the IFM 2009 study are referred to as “initial treatment.” 
b Dose intensity = (daily dose) x (number of daily doses per cycle) / (number of weeks per cycle). 
c For subjects with serum creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dL before Cycle 1, the recommended starting dose of lenalidomide was 5 mg/day with dose escalation as 
tolerated (related to potential myelosuppression) at the treating physician’s discretion (CSR SWOG S0777 Section 9.4.5.1). 
d Starting at Cycle 4, the dose of dexamethasone was reduced from 20 mg/day to 10 mg/day, which reduced the dose intensity from 53 mg/week to 26.7 
mg/week. 
2.4.2.  Main studies 
Study SWOG SO777 
Methods 
Study SWOG SO777 was a randomized, multicenter, Phase III clinical study studying lenalidomide and low 
dose  dexamethasone  (LLD)  versus  bortezomib,  lenalidomide  and  low  dose  dexamethasone  (BLLD)  for 
induction,  in  patients  with  previously  untreated  multiple  myeloma  without  an  intent  for  immediate 
autologous stem cell transplant.  
Methods

1.  Subjects must have had NDMM1, with measurable disease2. Subjects with non-secretory MM based 
upon standard M-component criteria (ie, measurable serum/urine M-component) were not eligible 
for this study. Exception: Subjects with non-secretory MM were eligible only if the baseline serum 
Freelite was elevated (see Section 10.1 of the protocol; Appendix 16.1.1). (Note that serum Freelite 
must have been drawn; serum light chains were not acceptable.) All tests for establishing baseline 
disease status must have been completed within 28 days prior to registration and documented on 
the Baseline and Follow-up Tumour Assessment Form for Multiple Myeloma 
2.  Subjects must have received no prior chemotherapy for this disease. Subjects must have received

with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL within 10 to 14 days and again within 24 hours prior to 
starting Cycle 1 of lenalidomide. Further, they must have either committed to continued abstinence 
from heterosexual intercourse or started 2 acceptable methods of birth control: one highly effective 
method  and  one  additional  effective  method  at  the  same  time,  at  least  28  days  before  starting 
lenalidomide. FCBP must have also agreed to ongoing pregnancy testing. Men must have agreed to 
use  a  latex  condom  during  sexual  contact  with  a  FCBP,  even  if  they  have  had  a  successful

Outcomes/endpoints 
• 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
o  Progression-free survival (PFS) defined as the time from the date of randomization to date 
of first documentation of progression (including symptomatic deterioration), or death due to 
any cause, whichever occurred earlier (as per investigator assessment). 
•  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
o  Overall survival (OS) defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause  
o  Response rate (CR, VGPR, PR, SD, and PD) based on IMWG criteria  
• 
Exploratory Endpoints 
o  Time to response (PR or better), time to CR or better, time to VGPR or better 
o  Duration of response 
o  Time to subsequent antimyeloma therapy (AMT) 
•  Safety Endpoints 
o  AEs, clinical laboratory tests, deaths, and SPMs 
Sample size 
The determination of sample size was based on hypotheses about the difference of RVd versus Rd for the 
primary endpoint PFS: H0: HR (RVd versus Rd) = 1 versus H1: HR (RVd versus Rd) ≠ 1 where HR (RVd 
versus Rd) is the hazard ratio (HR) between RVd arm and Rd. 
A PFS of 64% at 2 years was anticipated by the applicant in the Rd arm, based on data from the SWOG 
S0232  study.  This  corresponds  to  a  median  PFS  of  approximately  3  years,  assuming  an  exponential 
distribution of PFS. With 4 years of subject accrual, and 2.5 years of follow-up, a sample size of 220 eligible 
subjects per arm and 276 PFS events results in a study with 87% power to detect an increase of PFS of 50%, 
from a median of 3 years to 4.5 years, which corresponds to an HR of 0.67 (RVd versus Rd) and an increase 
in PFS at 2 years from 64% to 74%. These calculations were based on a 1-sided stratified log-rank test at 
level 0.025 with 2 interim analyses. 
Randomisation 
Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria were randomized (1:1) utilizing a dynamic allocation scheme to 
receive 1 of 2 treatment arms: lenalidomide, bortezomib, and low-dose dexamethasone for eight 3-week 
cycles (RVd) or lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone for six 4-week cycles (Rd) 
Subjects were stratified at randomization by: 
1. Stage (International Staging System [ISS] Stages I, II, or III) 
2. Intent to transplant at progression: Yes versus No. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis population 
•  Intent-to-treat (ITT) population: includes all subjects who are randomized and with valid consent prior to 
the randomization, and is used for the primary efficacy analysis 
•  Safety population: includes all subjects who are randomized and received at least one dose of study drug.  
Assessment report  
EMA/232212/2019 
Page 18/82 
 
  
  
•    Eligible population: defined as ITT subjects who met eligibility criteria, and is used for analyses of PFS, 
OS and overall response rate (ORR). 
Primary Efficacy analysis 
The applicant’s intention of the planned primary analysis for PFS is to use the same data cutoff date (5 
November 2015) as published by SWOG. The analysis for the primary endpoint PFS was based on disease 
assessment by IRAC using the IMWG criteria and the applicable PFS censoring rules (per SWOG S0777 
protocol, FDA and EMA guidelines). This analysis used the ITT population. In addition, PFS was updated 
using data available as of the new data cutoff date of 1 Dec 2016 (based on IRAC assessment). 
PFS was to be compared between RVd and Rd treatment arms using the stratified log-rank test, stratified by 
the 2 strata used in the randomization (ISS stage and Intent to transplant at progression).  
Additional analysis 
Subgroup analysis were planned to be performed for PFS and secondary efficacy endpoints on age ≤ 65 years 
and > 65 years), sex, race (Caucasian and non-Caucasian), ISS stage at randomization (I, II and III) and 
Intent to transplant (Yes or No). 
The efficacy endpoints were planned to be compared between treatment arms based on the eligible 
population, using the same methods as those used for the ITT analyses. 
Interim analysis 
Two formal interim analyses were planned after one third (92 of 276) and two thirds (184 of 276) of the total 
targeted PFS events (276) had occurred. The first interim analysis was at approximately 36 months (3 
years), after approximately 75% of subjects had been accrued. The second interim analysis was at 
approximately 54 months (4 and a half years), after all subjects had been accrued.  
A Haybittle-Peto approach was used for alpha spending, and a 1-sided alpha of 0.0025 was used for each 
interim analysis. If the null hypothesis was rejected at this level of significance, it would have suggested 
early termination of the trial and a conclusion that the RVd arm is better than the Rd arm. In addition, the 
alternative hypothesis of a 50% improvement of PFS for the RVd arm would be tested at the 1-sided level of 
0.0025, using an extension of the log-rank test that allows for testing a relative risk not equal to 1. Rejection 
of this alternative hypothesis would lead to early termination and a conclusion that the RVd arm is not better 
than the Rd arm. The actual decision to terminate the study early was to be made by the data safety 
monitoring committee (DSMC), and would consider response rates, OS, toxicities and other factors in 
addition to PFS. 
Protocol deviations 
The definition of major deviation was as follows: a major deviation occurs when a deviation for a specific 
modality was also considered a major deviation for the protocol overall: 1) a required modality was omitted; 
2) modalities were not administered in the correct sequence; 3) treatment modalities that were not allowed 
by the protocol were given; or 4) study coordinator identified a major surgical or RT deviation on a study that 
did not require discipline review.

Changes From Final Protocol to Final Statistical Analysis Plan 
Changes from the planned analyses described in the final SWOG S0777 protocol to the final SAP prepared by 
Celgene are described below: 
• 
In the SWOG S0777 protocol, only eligible subjects were considered as the ITT population in the 
protocol. In the final SAP, the ITT population includes all subjects (with valid consent) who were 
randomized. The ITT population, as randomized, was used for the primary efficacy analysis. 
• 
In the SWOG S0777 protocol, the Fisher’s exact test was proposed to compare response rates. 
However, the stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was used in the publication (Durie, 2017). In the 
final SAP, the same stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was used to compare response rate.

Changes From Final Statistical Analysis Plan 
• 
• 
In the final SWOG S0777 SAP (Section 10.1 in the SAP; Appendix 16.1.9), the primary PFS was to be 
based on the central assessment of PD by the Study Chair; instead, the primary PFS was analyzed using 
the independent assessment of PD by the IRAC. 
In the final SWOG S0777 SAP, the eligible population was defined as ITT subjects who met eligibility 
criteria and with valid consent as used in the SWOG S0777 publication (Durie, 2017). In the analyses 
presented in this report, the eligible population is defined as ITT subjects who met eligibility criteria. This 
included subjects with laboratory values collected outside the protocol-specified window.

Supportive studies 
Data from 2 studies (PETHEMA GEM2012 and IFM 2009) have been provided to support the treatment of TE 
patients (eligible for transplant) with NDMM. 
•  Study PETHEMA GEM2012 
This was an open-label, randomized, multicenter, national study that compared 2 pretransplant conditioning 
regimens (Bu-Mel versus MEL200) in subjects who received RVd as initial (induction) treatment. This study 
was conducted in Spain. The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was PFS for both conditioning regimens.  
Eligible subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 arms, which were designed as follows: 
•  Arm A: Six 4-week cycles (24 weeks) of RVd initial treatment followed by melphalan 200 mg/m2 
(MEL200)7 conditioning, auto-HSCT, and two 4-week cycles of RVd consolidation 
•  Arm B: Six 4-week cycles (24 weeks) of RVd initial treatment followed by busulfan with melphalan 
(Bu-Mel) conditioning, auto-HSCT, and two 4-week cycles of RVd consolidation 
For both treatment arms, the RVd dosing regimen was as follows: 
• 
Lenalidomide 25 mg/day PO on Days 1 to 21 
•  Bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 subcutaneously (SC) on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 
•  Dexamethasone 40 mg/day PO on Days 1 to 4 and 9 to 12

In the PETHEMA GEM2012 study, bone marrow samples were collected in all subjects at prespecified time 
points and referred for MRD analysis (secondary efficacy endpoint). MRD studies were carried out after each 
stage  of  treatment.  The  PETHEMA  GEM2012  study  defined  MRD  negativity  at  the  10-6  sensitivity  level. 
Results were also analyzed by the applicant with MRD negativity defined at the 10-4 sensitivity level. More 
subjects were MRD negative under the less stringent 10-4 cutoff level compared with the more stringent 10-6 
sensitivity level.

•  Study IFM 2009 
This study was a Phase 3, randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter study that was sponsored by the 
Centre  Hospitalier  Universitaire  (CHU)  de  Toulouse  with  partnership  and  close  collaboration  of  the 
Intergroupe Francophone du Myélome (IFM).  
The primary objective of this study was to compare PFS in subjects treated with RVd without immediate 
high-dose treatment (HDT) followed by lenalidomide maintenance (Arm A, or RVd) to those treated with RVd 
Assessment report

plus consolidation with HDT/auto-HSCT and 2 cycles of RVd, followed by lenalidomide maintenance (Arm B, 
or RVd + auto-HSCT).  
Randomization to Arm A or Arm B (1:1) occurred 2 to 3 weeks after the initiation of Cycle 1 of RVd and prior 
to Cycle 2 of RVd. 
•  Arm  A  (RVd  arm):  RVd  induction  (three  3-week  cycles  =  9  weeks)  without  immediate 
HDM/auto-HSCT followed by 5 cycles of RVd consolidation and lenalidomide maintenance (total of 8 
cycles of initial therapy, or 24 weeks, of RVd without transplant) 
•  Arm  B  (RVd  +  auto-HSCT  arm):  RVd  induction  (three  3-week  cycles  =  9  weeks)  + 
HDM/auto-HSCT followed by 2 cycles of RVd consolidation and lenalidomide maintenance.

auto-HSCT = autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; d = day or dexamethasone; del 17p = deletion in chromosome 17p; 
ECOG = Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group; FISH = fluorescence in situ hybridization; ISS = International Staging System; 
IV = intravenously; MEL200 = melphalan 200 mg/m2; MRD = minimal residual disease; NDMM = newly diagnosed multiple myeloma; 
PFS = progression-free survival; PO = orally; PS = performance status; R = lenalidomide; RVd = lenalidomide, bortezomib, and 
dexamethasone; SCT = stem cell transplant; t(4;14) = translocation involving chromosomes 4 and 14; t(14;16) = translocation involving 
chromosomes 14 and 16; V = bortezomib. 
a One cycle of induction (initial) therapy was given after registration and before randomization; 2 cycles of induction (initial) therapy were 
given after randomization. 
b High risk was defined as the presence of del 17p, t(4;14), or t(14;16) using FISH. 
Note: 1) For Arm A, RVd (without transplant) was given for 24 weeks: three 3-week cycles (9 weeks) of induction followed by five 3-week 
cycles (15 weeks) of consolidation. 
2) Bone marrow used for MRD was collected before or on Day 1 of RVd Cycle 4 (Arm B only), before or on Day 1 of maintenance, and 
after maintenance (= end of study treatment) or early discontinuation. 
The ITT population included 700 subjects (350 subjects in each treatment arm). They were enrolled between 
November 2010 and November 2012 at 69 sites in France, Belgium, and Switzerland. 
Regarding the primary efficacy endpoint, the DMC recommended to release the results early because the 
difference in PFS met the prespecified stopping criterion (p < 0.015) based on results of the second interim 
analysis. The final/primary PFS results after the second interim analysis (1 Sep 2015 data cut-off date) and 
an  updated  PFS  analysis  (1  Dec  2016  data  cut-off  date)  are  presented  below.  PFS  was  assessed  by 
investigators and centrally confirmed by medical monitor. 
Myeloma  response  rate  (secondary  efficacy  endpoint)  was  assessed  by  the  investigator  and  centrally 
confirmed by the medical monitor on an ongoing basis based on the IMWG Uniform Response Criteria.  
MRD was an exploratory endpoint at post-initial treatment, with negativity defined at the 10-4 sensitivity 
level.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
• 
Integrated analysis for patients eligible for transplant (TE patients)  
In the absence of a clinical trial directly comparing RVd and VTD in TE NDMM patients, the applicant provided 
an integrated analysis comparing an initial treatment regimen of RVd versus VTD supporting the claimed 
indication in this population. This was based on the individual subject data from the 4 identified RCTs: 
•  RVd – PETHEMA GEM2012 and IFM 2009 
• 
• 
PETHEMA GEM2012 
IFM 2009 
•  VTD – PETHEMA GEM2005 and IFM 2013-04 
o  PETHEMA GEM2005 
• 
IFM 2013-04 
The  PETHEMA  studies  were  identified  as  the  main  studies  for  the  integrated  analysis  based  on  the 
symmetrical  design  of  the  induction  regimens  and  the  duration  of  induction  cycles  (six  4-week  cycles) 
followed by auto-HSCT. The IFM studies were considered supportive studies for the integrated analysis. Both 
IFM studies included 3-week cycles of induction, the duration of induction therapy varied between the 2 IFM 
studies.

a Subjects in Arm A of Study IFM 2009 received 8 cycles of initial therapy with RVd: 3 cycles of RVd “induction therapy” followed by 5 
cycles  of  RVd  “consolidation  therapy.”  The  same  RVd  dosing  regimen  was  used  for  both,  except  for  a  reduced  dose  (10  mg)  of 
dexamethasone during consolidation. For the purpose of comparison to the PETHEMA GEM2012 study, the 8 cycles (24 weeks) of initial RVd 
therapy for Arm A in the IFM 2009 study are referred to as “initial treatment.” 
b Escalating doses of thalidomide in Cycle 1 of the IFM 2013-04 study: 50 mg/day on Days 1 to 14 and 100 mg/day on Days 15 to 21. 
c Reduced dose of dexamethasone (10 mg) during consolidation. 
The efficacy analyses were based on RVd and VTD cohorts stratified based on propensity score (PS-stratified 
cohorts), except for the covariate-adjusted regression analyses. For propensity score estimation, a logistic 
regression  model  was  used  in  which  treatment  group  was  regressed  based  on  11  identified  baseline 
variables: age, sex, height, weight, performance status score, International Staging System (ISS) disease 
stage,  hemoglobin,  creatinine  clearance  (CrCl),  albumin,  β2-microglobulin,  and  lactate  dehydrogenase 
(LDH).

Notes: 1) Each box represents one 4-week cycle of RVd or VTD. 
2) Bortezomib was given subcutaneously in the PETHEMA GEM2012 study and intravenously in the PETHEMA GEM2005 study. 
3) In the PETHEMA GEM2012 study, MRD was evaluated in subjects with immunofixation-negative complete response after each 
phase of treatment (induction, transplant, and consolidation). 
4) In the PETHEMA GEM2005 study, bone marrow used for MRD was collected at screening, to confirm a complete response (a minimum 
of  4  weeks  of  post-induction  chemotherapy  and  before  transplant),  and  after  approximately  3  months  post-transplant  (which  was  at 
pre-randomization for maintenance).

In the PETHEMA GEM2012 study, the PS-stratified cohort included 407 subjects who had received RVd. A 
total of 51 subjects from the ITT population (N = 458) were excluded from the RVd PS-stratified cohort due 
to missing data for one or more of the baseline variables used for propensity score calculation. 
In the PETHEMA GEM2005 study, the PS-stratified cohort included 129 subjects who had received VTD. One 
subject from the ITT population (N = 130) was excluded from the VTD PS-stratified cohort due to missing 
data for the baseline variable of β2-microglobulin, which was used for propensity score calculation.

Data cutoff date = 31 Mar 2017 for the PETHEMA GEM2012 study. The database for the PETHEMA GEM2005 study was final in April 2015. 
The  response  rate  was  defined  as  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint.  The  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  test, 
stratified on the stratum based on the quintiles of the propensity score, was used to estimate the difference 
of response rate and 95% CI of achieving a response with RVd versus VTD. For the post-initial treatment 
response  rate  of  ≥  VGPR,  the  noninferiority  of  RVd  versus  VTD  was  assessed.  The  primary  analysis  for 
response  rate  was  to  be  based  on  IRAC  assessment;  investigator  assessment  was  used  as  a  sensitivity 
analysis. 
Minimal residual disease negativity defined at a sensitivity level of 10-4 in bone marrow was analyzed for RVd 
in the PETHEMA GEM2012 study versus VTD in the PETHEMA GEM2005 study. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel 
test,  stratified  on  the  stratum  based  on  the  quintiles  of  the  propensity  score,  was  used  to  estimate  the 
difference of MRD negativity rate and the 95% CI.

For  time-to-events  endpoints,  including  PFS  and  OS,  Kaplan-Meier  methodology  was  used  to  provide 
descriptive statistics. 
As of 31 Mar 2017, the median follow-up of PFS for all subjects in the RVd cohort was short (24.0 months) 
(IA Table 20). At that time, 87 (21.4%) PD (investigator review, EMA censoring rules) or death events had 
occurred in the RVd cohort; therefore, PFS events are considered immature. In the VTD cohort, the median 
follow-up for all subjects  was 48.4 months,  with 60.5% PFS events (investigator review, EMA censoring 
rules). 
In this situation, the PFS event-free rate at 2 years (instead of median PFS), which mitigates the differences 
in  median  follow-up  and  number  of  events,  is  considered  a  more  representative  quantification  of  PFS 
comparison between the 2 cohorts. An estimated 82% of subjects in the RVd cohort and 69% of subjects in 
the VTD cohort did not have PD and remained alive at 2 years. 
Regarding OS, as of 31 Mar 2017, the median follow-up for all surviving subjects in the RVd cohort was short 
(26.9 months). At that time, 45 (11.1%) deaths had occurred in the RVd cohort; therefore, OS events are 
considered immature. In the VTD cohort, the median follow-up for all subjects was 69.1 months, with 34.9% 
deaths. 
An estimated 90% of subjects in the RVd cohort and 87% of subjects in the VTD cohort remained alive in this 
study at 2 years.

Regarding the exploratory endpoints:  
- 
Progression-free Survival 
As  of  1  Dec  2016,  the  median  follow-up  for  all  subjects  in  the  RVd  cohort  (IFM  2009  Arm  B)  was  43.9 
months, with 59.4% PFS events (investigator review, EMA censoring rules). As of 01 Mar 2016, the median 
follow-up  for  all  subjects  in  the  VTD  cohort  (IFM  2013-04)  was  short  (16.6  months).  At  that  time,  26 
(16.9%) PFS events (investigator review, EMA censoring rules) had occurred in the VTD cohort; therefore, 
PFS events are considered immature. An estimated 78% of subjects in the RVd cohort (IFM 2009 Arm B) and 
71% of subjects in the VTD cohort did not have PD and remained alive in this study at 2 years.  
-  Overall Survival 
As of 1 Dec 2016, the median follow-up for all surviving subjects in the RVd cohort (IFM 2009 Arm B) was 
56.9 months, with 23.3% deaths. As of 01 Mar 2016, the median follow-up for all surviving subjects in the 
VTD cohort (IFM 2013-04) was short (17.6 months). At that time, 8 (5.2%) deaths had occurred in the VTD 
cohort; therefore, OS events are considered immature. An estimated 90% of subjects in the RVd cohort (IFM 
2009 Arm B) and 93% of subjects in the VTD cohort remained alive in this study at 2 years.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Three studies were submitted to support the claimed indication in patients with newly diagnosed multiple 
myeloma (NDMM). 
The  SWOG  S0777  study  evaluated  RVd  (lenalidomide,  bortezomib  and  dexamethasone)  versus  Rd 
(lenalidomide  and  dexamethasone)  for  initial  treatment  in  subjects  with  previously  untreated  MM  not 
intended  to  undergo  immediate  auto-HSCT.  Data  from  2  other  studies  conducted  in  Europe  (PETHEMA 
GEM2012,  and  IFM  2009)  and  an  integrated  analysis  comparing  an  initial  treatment  regimen  of  RVd 
(PETHEMA  GEM2012  and  IFM  2009)  versus  bortezomib,  thalidomide  and  dexamethasone  (i.e.  VTD) 
(PETHEMA GEM2005 and IFM 2013-04) were submitted to support the treatment of TE patients with NDMM. 
The data provided come from published investigational studies with different designs, populations, methods 
for assessment, censoring rules and statistical analysis plans. 
Main study - SWOG S0777 
The SWOG S0777 was a  Phase 3, randomized, active-controlled, open-label, multicentre study that was 
conducted in the US in 523 subjects (age ≥ 18 years) with NDMM. The study compared the new proposed 
regimen RVd triplet (eight 3-week cycles) versus the approved regimen Rd doublet (six 4-week cycles) as 
initial treatment (24 weeks) of subjects not intended to undergo immediate auto-HSCT. 
The study was performed in NDMM patients TNE, i.e. aged over 65 years or aged under 65 and with no 
possibility to undergo auto-HSCT, with a stratification by ISS stage and intent to transplant at progression. 
The  study  was  open-label,  which  is  considered  acceptable  given  the  known  safety  profile  of  IV  route  of 
administration for bortezomib. The inclusion criteria were in accordance with the IMWG criterion to define 
active MM, which have remained similar since the beginning of the study. The baseline characteristics were 
well-balanced  between  the  treatment  groups,  except  for  the  cytogenetic  risk,  the  frailty  and  the  age: 
patients in RVd arm seemed to be in a better condition at screening than patients in the Rd arm. However, 
the slight numeric differences in cytogenetic risk, frailty, and age between the two treatment arms were not 
considered clinically meaningful.  
One  of  the  proposed  regimen  scheme  for  RVd  for  this  new  indication  consists  in  21-day  cycles  with 
lenalidomide at 25mg on day 1-14, bortezomib at 1,3mg/m² on day 1, 4, 8 and 11 and dexamethasone at 
20mg on day 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11 and 12. The 21-day cycles schedule has already been used in previous phase 
II  clinical  trials  (Richardson,  2010;  Roussel,  2010),  but  28-day  cycles  schedule  is  the  current  approved 
posology for Revlimid. Exposure for lenalidomide on initial treatment (24 weeks) was comparable for both 
schedules (2800mg for 21-day cycles / 3150mg for 28-day cycles). During RVd 21-day cycles of induction, 
patients received 41,6mg/m² of bortezomib, which is consistent with the approved bortezomib posology in 
MM described in the relevant SmPC. 
The  primary  objective  of  the  SWOG  S0777  study  was  to  compare  the  PFS  in  subjects  with  NDMM  who 
received  initial  treatment  with  RVd  versus  Rd.  The  choice  of  PFS  as  primary  endpoint  was  considered 
acceptable according to EMA guidelines (EMA/CHMP/205/95) and recommendations for the evaluation of 
efficacy of therapeutic strategies in multiple myeloma. The secondary objectives of the study focused on the 
overall survival and the response rate of the disease to treatment, which were also considered relevant. 
Supportive study - PETHEMA GEM2012 
The  PETHEMA  GEM2012  was  a  Phase  3,  randomized,  controlled,  open-label,  multicenter,  national  study 
conducted in Spain in 458 subjects (aged 18 to 65 years) with TE NDMM.  Inclusion criteria and baseline 
characteristics  of  the  subjects  included  in  the  study  reflected  the  aimed  population  of  TE  patients,  who 
should be young (< 65 years old) and not frail to undergo auto-HSCT. 
Assessment report  
EMA/232212/2019 
Page 45/82 
 
  
  
The  second  proposed  regimen  scheme  for  RVd  for  this  new  indication  consists  in  28-day  cycles  with 
lenalidomide at 25mg on day 1-21, bortezomib at 1,3mg/m² on day 1, 4, 8 and 11 and dexamethasone at 
40mg on day 1-4 and 8-11. All subjects in the study received RVd as induction treatment followed by 1 of 2 
pretransplant  conditioning  regimens  (busulfan  with  melphalan  [Bu-Mel]  or  MEL20012),  then  underwent 
auto-HSCT. After auto-HSCT, subjects were to receive two more 28-day cycles of RVd as consolidation.  
The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  compare  PFS  after  auto-HSCT  with  the  2  pre  transplant 
conditioning regimens in subjects who had received prior RVd induction treatment. As the study was not 
designed to compare RVd regimen with the approved standard of care for induction in transplant-eligible 
patients (VD or VTD), but to compare two pre transplant conditioning regimen after a similar induction by 
RVd, the results presented would not allow to conclude on the efficacy of Revlimid in the claimed indication 
for TE NDMM patients. 
Supportive study - IFM 2009 
The IFM 2009 was a Phase 3, randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter study conducted in France, 
Belgium, and Switzerland in 700 subjects (aged 18 to 65 years) with TE NDMM. The study compared the RVd 
regimen as initial treatment with or without auto-HSCT in the management of TE NDMM. 
The primary objective of the study was to compare PFS in subjects who received initial RVd treatment with 
and  without  auto-HSCT.  Similarly  to  PETHEMA  GEM2012,  the  study  was  not  designed  to  compare  RVd 
regimen with the approved standard of care for induction in transplant-eligible patients (VD or VTD), but to 
compare two therapeutic strategies using RVd as initial regimen treatment. The results presented didn’t 
allow to conclude on the efficacy of Revlimid in the claimed indication for TE NDMM patients. 
Integrated analysis 
The integrated analysis was based on the individual subject data from 4 identified randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs). 
The  objective  of  the  integrated  analysis  was  to  compare  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  RVd  versus  the 
regulatory-authorized  standard  of  care,  VTD.  Efficacy  was  to  be  based  on  the  assessment  of  myeloma 
response  by  IRAC.  The  primary  objective  was  to  demonstrate  noninferiority  of  the  primary  endpoint: 
post-initial treatment response rate (as measured by ≥ VGPR based on IMWG criteria) in TE NDMM subjects 
receiving RVd or VTD induction regimens. 
To  support  the  indication  for  RVd  in  TE  NDMM  patients,  the  absence  of  a  prospective  comparative 
randomized clinical trial of RVd against one of the standard of care (VD or VTD) remains an issue.  
The 2 studies conducted by the PETHEMA Foundation, PETHEMA GEM2012 (RVd) and PETHEMA GEM2005 
(VTD), were identified as the main studies for the integrated efficacy and safety analyses based on their 
symmetrical design of the induction regimens, including number, length, and duration of induction cycles 
(six 4-week cycles of induction), for a total of 24 weeks of induction (initial) therapy followed by auto-HSCT. 
The 2 studies conducted by the IFM, IFM 2009 (RVd) and IFM 2013-04 (VTD), are considered supportive 
studies for the integrated efficacy and safety analyses because the differences in the number of cycles for 
the RVd and VTD induction regimens used limit the potential to make a direct and easy comparison. 
Cohorts with patients from study PETHEMA GEM2012 (Arm A + B) and study PETHEMA GEM2005 (Arm C) 
were stratified based on propensity score. This process cannot totally mimic the randomization process to 
re-create  two  comparable  treatment  arms.  Potential  treatment  effects  that  can  be  observed  in  this 
integrated analysis may be related to unselected baseline variables or hidden variables that the propensity 
score could not account for.  
The designs of both PETHEMA studies were similar for induction and auto-HSCT. In the PETHEMA GEM2012 
there were 2 cycles of RVd as consolidation after transplant.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Main study - SWOG S0777 
The  study  reached  its  primary  objective  to  demonstrate  superiority  of  RVd  on  Rd.  At  the  time  of  the  1 
December  2016  data  cut-off  date,  the  median  PFS  was  41.7  months  in  the  RVd  arm  compared  to  29.7 
months  in  the    Rd  arm  (HR=0.76;  95%  CI:  0.62  to  0.94;  P=0.010)  as  determined  by  IRAC  review  and 
applying EMA censoring rules. 
Overall,  results  from  sensitivity  analysis  (different  data  cut-offs,  investigator,  IRAC  or  Central  review 
assessment, EMA/FDA/SWOG censoring rules) were consistent with those observed in the primary analysis. 
The secondary objectives were reached as OS was superior in RVd arm versus Rd, with an improvement of 
21.9 months (89,1 vs 67,2), which is statistically and clinically relevant. These results could be considered 
as sufficiently mature (>50% events in control arm). A negative effect of RVd on OS could reasonably be 
ruled out. At post-initial treatment, for RVd, 58, 2% subjects obtained ≥ VGPR and for Rd, 31,9% subjects 
obtained ≥ VGPR. These results are consistent with the primary endpoints results. 
For  subgroups  analyses  PFS  was  better  in  RVd  arms  vs  Rd  arms,  whether  patients  were  at  intention  to 
undergo transplant or not at randomization. Overall, it appears that respectively 79 subjects in the RVd arm 
and 91 subjects in the Rd arm effectively underwent stem cell transplantation. Among patients who were 
categorized  as  TNE,  only  19%  (48/261)  receiving  ASCT.  Patients  appear  to  have  been  well  categorized. 
Among  transplanted  patients  (prior  or  after  progression  disease),  difference  in  OS  are  not  statistically 
significant between RVd and RD treatment (HR= 0.75; IC (0.47; 1.22). This is similar (HR= 0.65 IC: 0.31; 
1.33) when analysed only for patients who undergo transplant before PD.  
Supportive study - PETHEMA GEM2012 
The study failed to demonstrate its primary objective as data were not mature with the chosen cut-off date 
(31 Mar 2017) to get enough events to reach PFS median. A total of 102 (22.3%) events of PD or death (both 
arms combined) had occurred, which is approximately one third of the 294 total events needed for the final 
analysis of PFS. 
Regarding the secondary endpoints the OS results weren’t mature. A 36 months 83% OS in RVd arm was 
found in SWOG S0777 study which is consistent with the results presented in PETHEMA GEM2012 study: 
84,2 % and 80,2 % for each arm. Post-induction, 24 weeks of RVd (both arms combined) leads to 66, 6% 
of ≥ VGPR (33, 4% CR). To compare, in SWOG S0777 study, 58, 2% subjects obtained ≥VGPR (5,3% CR). 
Supportive study - IFM 2009 
The study reached its primary objective as the median PFS was estimated at 35.0 months in the RVd arm 
and 45.8 months in the RVd + auto-HSCT arm. These results are not informative for the current application 
but a focus was made on the results of the RVd arm. The PFS was found 42, 5 months in SWOG S0777 study 
with  a  slightly  older  and  frailer  population.  Posology  for  lenalidomide  maintenance  differs  between  the 
studies as for SWOG S0777 they chose a 25mg/d 21d/28 schedule with 40mg/d 1d/week dexamethasone 
whereas for IFM it was a 10 or 15mg/d continuous monotherapy of lenalidomide. Also, IFM 2009 integrated 
an European population of subjects and seemed to get lower results than those obtained in the SWOG S0777 
study with an American population.  
For secondary objectives, median OS time at the time of the 01 Dec 2016 data cut off was not reached in 
either  treatment  arms.  By  IRAC  assessment,  after  24  weeks  of  RVd,  68,3%  subjects  obtained  ≥  VGPR 
(18,6% CR).

Integrated analysis 
The applicant advanced in this integrated analysis the non-inferiority of RVd regimen upon VTD regimen, 
based on the myeloma response rate: 66,3% ≥ VGPR post-induction against 51,2%. 
The respectively 74,4% vs 53,5% rates post-transplant are supportive, but the strategies were different at 
this point (2 cycles of RVd after auto HSCT vs no treatment) and no conclusions can be drawn from these 
results. The MRD negativity rate post induction difference was 8,6% which supports the non-inferiority of 
RVd on VTD. 
In  conclusion,  for  the  transplant-eligible  population,  the  design  of  the  supportive  studies  and  the 
interpretation  of  the  results  of  the  integrated  analysis  did  not  allow  to  conclude  on  the  superiority  or 
non-inferiority in clinical efficacy of the RVd regimen compared to the approved standard of care. Since no 
new data and no detailed outcomes of transplantation were provided with RVd compared to the standard of 
care,  the  cross-study  comparison  as  presented  by  the  MAH  was  insufficient  to  convincingly  establish 
efficacy.  Therefore  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  indication  should  be  restricted  to  adult  patients  with 
previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for transplant. Since the indication for adult 
patients  with  previously  untreated  multiple  myeloma  who  are  not  eligible  for  transplant  was  already 
approved for Revlimid in combination treatment based on the data using the combinations dexamethasone 
or melphalan with prednisone the CHMP considered that the final indication should be read as follows: 
Revlimid as combination therapy with dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, or melphalan 
and prednisone (see section 4.2) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated 
multiple  myeloma  who  are  not  eligible  for  transplant.  This  indication  covers  the  previously  approved 
combinations  (dexamethasone  and  melphalan  with  prednisone)  and  the  new  applied  combination  (with 
bortezomib and dexamethasone). 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The clinical efficacy of the triplet regimen lenalidomide + bortezomib + dexamethasone in newly diagnosed 
multiple myeloma patients has been demonstrated in transplant non-eligible patients with NDMM as 
indicated by the improvement of PFS in study SWOG S0777.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety analysis provided by the applicant focused on 24 weeks of RVd initial treatment for the safety 
populations of the following studies: SWOG S0777 (RVd and Rd arms), PETHEMA GEM2012 (both RVd arms 
combined), and IFM 2009 Arm A (RVd no transplant). A total of 1076 subjects were included in the safety 
population to assess the safety profile of RVd as initial treatment: SWOG S0777 (262 subjects), PETHEMA 
GEM2012 (458 subjects), and IFM 2009 (356 subjects). RVd dosing regimens in these studies were either six 
28-day cycles or eight 21-day cycles. The data cut-off dates are 31 March 2017 for the PETHEMA GEM2012 
study and 1 December 2016 for the IFM 2009 and SWOG S0777 studies. 
The safety population includes all subjects who were randomized and received at least one dose of study 
drug. If a subject received study drug other than the subject’s randomized treatment assignment, then the 
subject was assigned to the treatment arm reflecting the treatment that the subject actually received during 
the study. The integrated analysis using data from 2 PETHEMA and 2 IFM studies was provided to support the 
safety of RVd in comparison to VTD.

AE = adverse event; CRF = case report form; CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events; DVT = deep vein thrombosis; ICF 
= informed consent form; MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; PE = pulmonary embolism; SAE = serious adverse event; 
RVd  =  lenalidomide,  bortezomib,  and  dexamethasone;  SPM  =  second  primary  malignancy;  VTD  =  bortezomib,  thalidomide,  and 
dexamethasone. 
a Verbatim terms are recorded in French, and then coded to French MedDRA preferred terms; the French MedDRA preferred terms are then 
converted to English MedDRA preferred terms. 
b The NCI CTCAE Version 3.0 criteria are used  in 2 AE datasets  (source = nonhaematologic toxicity CRF),  but no CTCAE version  was 
provided for the other 2 AE datasets (AE, infections). 
Notes: For all 3 studies, treatment-emergent adverse events in each treatment phase were defined as any AEs that began on or after the 
start of study drug in that phase through the day before the start date of the next phase, or through 30 days after the last dose of study 
drug if the phase was the last phase in the study. A subject with multiple occurrences of a TEAE was counted only once in that TEAE 
category. 
An overview of the treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) during initial treatment for the 3 studies is 
presented below.

a Both RVd arms combined. For the PETHEMA GEM2012 study, TEAEs include all SAEs plus non-SAEs that the investigator considered 
related to study treatment. 
b For the purpose of comparison to the PETHEMA GEM2012 and SWOG S0777 studies, the 8 cycles (24 weeks) of initial RVd therapy for 
Arm A in the IFM 2009 study are referred to as “initial treatment.” 
c Graded using CTCAE Version 4.03 for the PETHEMA GEM2012 study and Version 4.0 for the IFM 2009 and SWOG S0777 studies. 
d “Discontinuation” refers to study discontinuation for the PETHEMA GEM2012 study and treatment discontinuation for the IFM 2009 
and SWOG S0777 studies. The TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation were recorded on the Off Treatment Notice Form for the 
SWOG S0777 study. 
Notes: Treatment-emergent adverse events in each treatment phase were defined as any AEs that began on or after the start of study drug 
in that phase through the day before the start date of the next phase, or through 30 days after the last dose of study drug if the phase was 
the last phase in the study. A subject with multiple occurrences of a TEAE was counted only once in that TEAE category.

Data cutoff date = 01 Dec 2016 
•  Secondary Primary Malignancies (SPMs) 
Second primary malignancies (SPMs) following lenalidomide-containing treatment were first noted in 2010 
when an increased frequency of haematologic SPMs was reported in subjects with newly diagnosed multiple 
myeloma  (NDMM)  receiving  lenalidomide  in  combination  with  oral  melphalan  and  prednisone  (Palumbo, 
2012)  or  as  long-term  maintenance  treatment  after  high-dose  melphalan  (HDM)  conditioning  therapy 
supported  by  autologous  hematopoietic  stem  cell  transplantation  (auto-HSCT)  (Attal,  2012;  McCarthy, 
2012). Following these findings, lenalidomide protocols were amended to report all SPMs as serious adverse 
events (SAEs) and to continue to follow study subjects for the occurrence of SPMs after discontinuation of 
study treatment during follow-up for survival. An overview of SPM data following initial (induction) therapy 
with lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (RVd) in subjects with NDMM from trials was conducted 
by independent cooperative research groups.

The observed incidence rates for haematologic (range: 0 to 0.16 per 100 person-years) and solid tumour 
(range: 0.21 to 1.04 per 100 person-years) SPMs observed in the RVd arms of the 3 NDMM studies (SWOG 
S0777, PETHEMA GEM2012, and IFM 2009) are consistent with those for the Rd arm in the SWOG S0777 
study (incidence rates: 0.27 per 100 person-years [haematologic SPMs] and  0.90 per 100 person-years 
[solid tumour SPMs]). Furthermore, the observed incidence rates are comparable with those observed in the 
MM-020  study  that  forms  the  basis  of  the  current  language  for  lenalidomide  in  combination  with 
dexamethasone in the approved EU SmPC (incidence rates: 0.16 per 100 person-years [haematologic SPMs] 
and 1.58 per 100 person-years [solid tumour SPMs]). 
Safety in special populations 
•  Transplant eligibility 
Transplant  eligibility  was  assessed  in  the  SWOG  S0777  study  using  an  age  cutoff  of  ≤  65  years  and  an 
assessment  on  the  fitness/frailty  level  of  subjects  based  on  age,  Charlson  comorbidity  index  score,  and 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status. The frequencies of subjects with TEAEs 
(any grade) by transplant eligibility reported in ≥ 20% of subjects in any treatment arm are summarized 
below.

Post marketing experience 
Lenalidomide was first approved for marketing by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 27 Dec 
2005. The most recent Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR 14) covered the reporting period 27 Dec 2016 
through  26  Dec  2017.  As  of  the  cut-off  date  for  this  PSUR,  lenalidomide  is  approved  in  83  countries 
worldwide, including the US, 28 countries in the European Union (EU), 3 countries in the European Free 
Trade  Association  (EFTA),  as  well  as  in  52  countries  outside of  the  US  and  EU/European  Economic  Area 
(EEA). 
As  of  the  cut-off  date  for  the  most  recent  PSUR,  approximately  686,537  patients  have  been  exposed 
cumulatively  to  lenalidomide  from  all  sources  and  all  geographic  areas.  During  the  most  recent  PSUR 
interval, 183,357 patients have been exposed to lenalidomide from all sources and all geographic areas.

During the reporting period, nine new safety signals were evaluated: solid organ transplant (SOT) rejection 
and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) were identified from the literature; leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) 
was identified following a review of vasculitis for thalidomide; B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) 
was  identified  in  a  German  investigator-initiated  trial;  and  the  remaining  five  signals  were  identified  by 
Pharmacovigilance  Risk  Assessment  Committee  (PRAC).  Glaucoma,  retinal  disorders,  acute  generalized 
exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) and increased human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) were identified by 
PRAC in its assessment of the PSUR covering the period from 27 Dec 2015 to 26 Dec 2016. The signal of 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) was identified by PRAC through the dedicated European 
Pharmacovigilance Issues Tracking Tool (EPITT) procedure. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overview of TEAE 
With regard to the frailer and older population for the subjects of SWOG S0777, although the proportion of 
treatment discontinuation due to TEAE was higher than in other studies, especially in the RVd arm, this can 
be partly attributed to study conduct including management of discontinuations during the initial treatment 
period,  the  receipt  of  subsequent  AMT,  and  the  management  of  toxicities,  which  was  consistent  with 
standard clinical practice. 
In SWOG S07777 study, RVd is associated with more Grade 3 or 4 TEAE related to study drug and greater 
treatment discontinuation due to TEAEs during the entire treatment period compared to Rd. 
The RVd regimen was associated with comparable rates of TEAEs, for all grades as well as grades 3 and 4, 
with the VTD regimen. Fewer treatment discontinuations or dose reductions due to TEAE were reported in 
PETHEMA GEM2012. 
TEAEs (any grade) frequencies by SOC reported in SWOG S0777 for the Rd arm were consistent with the 
well-known lenalidomide + dexamethasone association safety profile. No new risk has been identified. 
TEAEs frequencies with RvD were variable throughout the studies but addition of bortezomib to lenalidomide 
and  dexamethasone  led  to  an  overall  similar  safety  profile,  notably  with  particular  increased  risk  for 
peripheral sensory neuropathy. This adverse effect, which occurs at a very common frequency as described 
in Velcade SmPC, may be reduced with a subcutaneous administration (SC) instead of intraveinous infusion 
of  the  product.  Due  to  differences  in  reporting  of  adverse  effects,  it  seems  that  the  preferred  term 
“peripheral neuropathy” for PETHEMA GEM2012 actually might contain both peripheral sensory neuropathy 
and peripheral neuropathy and was  not clearly reported.  PETHEMA GEM2012 was the only study where 
subjects received SC bortezomib.   
In  study  SWOG  S0777,  subjects  showed  an  increase  in  some  TEAEs  frequencies  compared  to  the  other 
studies, such as metabolism and nutrition disorders, investigations, musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders and respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders, for both arms.  
Safety data from the integrated analysis comparing TEAE between RVd and VTD should be assessed with 
caution as bortezomib route of administration, and so subsequent toxicity profile, was different for PETHEMA 
GEM2012 and IFM 2009 studies. Furthermore, some of TEAE rates in the VTD cohorts (for example “Blood 
and Lymphatic System Disorders”), are not consistent between studies. For IFM studies, the comparison was 
made  on  a  12  weeks  duration  of  therapy  which  is  quite  short.  The  safety  data  are  mostly  supportive. 
However, no new safety concerns seem to emerge from these data. 
The  Grade  3  or  4  TEAEs  frequencies  were  allocated  similarly  to  the  All  grades  frequencies.  RVd  was 
associated  with  higher  adverse  events  frequencies  than  Rd,  although  these  frequencies  have  to  be 
considered taking into account the frailty and age of the population of the studies. Same grade 3 or 4 TEAEs 
were reported but at a lower frequency in studies PETHEMA GEM2012 and IFM 2009. 
Assessment report  
EMA/232212/2019 
Page 68/82 
 
  
  
Both PETHEMA GEM2012 and IFM 2009 studies in the integrated analysis showed an increase in grades 3 or 
4 TEAEs for Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders for the RVd regimen compared to the VTD regimen. 
AESIs 
In SWOG S07777 study, for overlapping toxicities of lenalidomide and bortezomib, higher frequencies in the 
RVd arm compared with the Rd arm were reported during initial treatment for TEAEs in the AESI categories 
of  peripheral  neuropathy  (a  difference  of  36.6%),  thrombocytopenia  (difference  of  11.9%),  hepatic 
disorders  (difference  of  9.6%),  cardiac  arrhythmias  (difference  of  8.2%),  and  infections  (difference  of 
6.2%). 
In PETHEMA GEM2012 study, the frequencies of treatment-emergent AEs in the following categories were 
reported  in  ≥  5%  of  subjects  (both  RVd  arms  combined)  during  the  initial  treatment  phase:  peripheral 
neuropathy (38.0%), neutropenia (31.9%), infections (31.2%), thrombocytopenia (25.3%), and hepatic 
disorders (8.1%) were reported. 
In IFM 2009 study, the frequencies of TEAEs in the following categories were reported in ≥ 5% of subjects in 
Arm A (RVd; no transplant) during the initial treatment phase: peripheral neuropathy (56.5%), infections 
(52.8%), neutropenia (46.9%), thrombocytopenia (19.9%), hepatic disorders (13.2%), bleeding (7.0%), 
and cardiac arrhythmias (5.9%). 
No new safety concerns were observed with RVd initial treatment in the NDMM setting when administered for 
up to 24 weeks, and no changes are proposed to the classification of these selected TEAEs as identified of 
potential risks in the Revlimid EU RMP. 
SAEs 
Overall, 40,1% of the subjects experienced SAEs in the RVd arm of SWOG S0777 study, versus 28,5% in the 
Rd  arm.  The  results  were  consistent  between  the  studies,  unless  for  “Infections  and  Infestations”  and 
“Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders” in PETHEMA study where reported at a higher frequency. 
It should be noted that SAEs of neuropathies were not reported in ≥ 2% of the subjects despite the known 
effects of the association of bortezomib and lenalidomide and the reported frequency of grades 3 or 4 TEAEs. 
Deaths 
The rate of deaths is low during the initial treatment period, which is consistent with the non-aggressive type 
of the Multiple Myeloma. 
For SWOG S0777 study, in the RVd arm, 5 subjects died of pneumonia, myocardial ischemia, coronary artery 
disease, diabetic hyperglycemic coma, and “death” (1 subject each), and 2 subjects died of their Myeloma. 
In the Rd arm, 3 subjects died of sepsis, coronary artery disease, and acute renal failure (1 subject each) 
and 3 subjects died of their Myeloma. 
In  PETHEMA  GEM2012  (both  arms  combined),  6  subjects  died  of  infection  (4  subjects),  cardiovascular 
disease (1 subject) and the last subject died from multiple causes (acute pulmonary edema, cardiac arrest, 
hypocalcemia, renal failure, and its Myeloma). 1 subject also died of unknown cause. 
In IFM 2009 (arm A : RVd only), 1 subject died of respiratory distress. 
Overall there were 103 deaths in SWOG S07777 RVd arm and 129 deaths in Rd arm. In the RVd arm, 9 of 11 
deaths that occurred on treatment were due to a TEAE. These included coronary artery disease, myocardial 
infarction, myocardial ischemia, convulsion, diabetic hyperglycemic coma, influenza, pneumonia, death, and 
pulmonary embolism for 1 subject each. In the Rd arm, 7 of 12 deaths that occurred on treatment were due 
to  a  TEAE.  Treatment-emergent  AEs  resulting  in  death  included  cardiac  arrest,  coronary  artery  disease, 
cerebrovascular accident, anemia, multiple organ failure, sepsis, encephalopathy, and acute renal failure for 
1 subject each.

Second Primary Malignancies 
There were no findings of an increase in secondary primary malignancies associated with adding bortezomib 
to the lenalidomide-dexamethasone combination. 
Subgroup analysis 
Age 
The great age of subjects was associated with more TEAEs of any grade and also more TEAEs of grades 3 or 
4, in RVd arm as well as in Rd arm. The safety profile of both combinations seems to converge with advanced 
age, probably more related to the associated comorbidities rather than with the regimen of treatment itself. 
Score ISS 
A more advanced disease, as characterized by the ISS Stage III, was associated with more grades 3 or 4 
TEAE, treatment-emergent SAE or treatment discontinuation due to TEAE for all groups (RVd or Rd) 
Clearance of creatinine 
Lower baseline creatinine clearance was associated with more grades 3 or 4 TEAE, treatment-emergent SAE 
or treatment discontinuation due to TEAE for all groups (RVd or Rd), which is consistent with the safety 
profile of lenalidomide. 
ECOG status 
Frailer subjects (with an ECOG status ≥ 2) seem to be at higher risk for TEAEs of grades 3, 4, or 5 and 
treatment emergent SAEs. The small number of patients, precluding a robust assessment, should however 
be highlighted. 
Discontinuations due to adverse events 
The  frequencies  of  discontinuations  were  quite  variables  between  studies,  taking  into  account  that  the 
assessment of toxicities could have been underestimated in PETHEMA GEM2012 compared to IFM 2009 and 
SWOG S07777. 
Furthermore, the frailty and the advanced age of patients in SWOG S0777 led to more discontinuations. 
Overall, despite the differences of frequencies of discontinuations among the studies, they were consistent 
with the known safety profile of lenalidomide and bortezomib. 
Safety  data  from  the  integrated  analysis  showed  that  RVd  regimen  (with  SC  bortezomib)  seems  to  be 
associated with less peripheral neuropathy toxicities leading to discontinuation than VTD regimen (with IV 
bortezomib), which is consistent with lenalidomide and thalidomide well-known safety profiles. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
No new risks were identified for the combination of lenalidomide and bortezomib but there was an 
overlapping in some toxicities, which remained manageable. Overall the safety profile is acceptable. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 6.5 and 8 of the SmPC are updated. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.  
As a consequence, the MAH submitted a request to add 7-capsule pack sizes for the 7.5 mg, 20 mg and 25 
mg strengths of Revlimid (lenalidomide) to support the proposed posology and lenalidomide dose 
modification which was accepted by the CHMP. 
Additionally, minor editorial changes have been introduced throughout the PI and annex II key elements of 
the RMM have been updated to include information on timing of blood and semen donation in line with the 
SmPC section 4.4. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the MAH 
show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability 
of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Revlimid as combination therapy with  bortezomib and dexamethasone (see section 4.2) is indicated for the 
treatment of adult patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for transplant. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
A number of drugs are authorized as initial treatment for adult patients with previously untreated multiple 
myeloma who are not eligible for transplant such as:  lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone (Rd) 
or lenalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone followed by lenalidomide for maintenance 
(MPR+R),; bortezomib in combination with melphalan and prednisone is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for high dose chemotherapy with 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation and thalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone is 
indicated as first line treatment of patients with untreated multiple myeloma, aged ≥ 65 years or ineligible 
for high dose chemotherapy.  
Despite the introduction of therapeutic options with new mechanisms of action and a better understanding 
of  the  disease  biology,  MM  is  not  curable  with  current  therapies.  Most  patients  still  experience  disease

relapse  and  require  several  lines  of  therapy  (Agarwal,  2017;  Larocca,  2017; van  de  Velde,  2017;  Yong, 
2016). The course of MM is characterized by subsequently shorter periods of remission and relapse following 
sequential  lines  of  treatment  (Agarwal,  2017;  Larocca,  2017;  Moreau,  2017).  Thus,  first-line  therapy  is 
generally accepted to be of primary importance in providing long-term benefits for MM patients (Mateos, 
2015).  Furthermore,  many  patients  only  receive  1  or  at  most  2  lines  of  treatment  (Raab,  2016; 
Willenbacher, 2018; Yong, 2016). Thus, all patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) should 
receive the most effective therapy available upfront. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical package of Lenalidomide for the proposed indication was supported by: 
SWOG S0777 study a randomized, multicenter, Phase III clinical study studying lenalidomide and low dose 
dexamethasone (LLD) versus bortezomib, lenalidomide and low dose dexamethasone (BLLD) for induction, 
in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma without an intent for immediate autologous stem cell 
transplant. 
PETHEMA GEM2012 an open-label, randomized, multicenter, national trial studying induction therapy with 
bortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone followed by high dose chemotherapy with melphalan-200 
(MEL-200) versus busulfan-melphalan and consolidation with VRD-GEM in patients under 65 years old with 
newly diagnosed symptomatic multiple myeloma.  
IFM 2009 study, a Phase 3, randomized, study comparing conventional dose treatment using a combination 
of lenalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone to high-dose treatment with peripheral stem transplant in 
the initial management of myeloma in patients up to 65 years of age. 
An integrated analysis comparing the efficacy and safety of an initial treatment regimen of RVd (PETHEMA 
GEM2012 and IFM 2009) or VTD (PETHEMA GEM2005 and IFM 2013-04) in support of the treatment of TE 
patients with NDMM. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Based on the results (1 December 2016 data cut-off date) from SWOG S0777 study in the ITT population, 
170 of 263 subjects (64.6%) in the RVd arm and 196 of 260 subjects (75.4%) in the Rd arm had progressed 
or died, based on events as determined by IRAC review and applying EMA censoring rules. The median PFS 
was 41.7 months in the RVd arm compared to 29.7 months in the  Rd arm (HR=0.76; 95% CI: 0.62 to 0.94; 
P=0.010).  The results from the sensitivity analysis of the PFS were consistent with those observed in the 
primary analysis. 
In addition, results in secondary endpoints such as overall survival (a statistically and clinically relevant 
difference  of 21.9 months) or response rate (58,2% subjects in RVd arm versus 31,9% subjects obtained 
VGPR or CR at post-initial treatment) were consistent with the primary endpoints results. These results could 
be considered as sufficiently mature (>50% events in control arm). A negative effect of RVd on OS could 
reasonably be ruled out. Overall survival results for the updated cut-off 15 May 2018 are consistent with 
those in the primary analysis where a wide separation of the Kaplan-Meier curves is maintained through this 
latest follow-up. As of 15 May 2018, there was a 27% reduction in the risk of death for subjects in the RVd 
arm compared with those in the Rd arm (HR = 0.73; 95% CI = 0.57 to 0.94). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are no uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most commonly reported grades 3 or 4 ADRs in the study SWOG S0777 for the arm RVd were peripheral 
sensory neuropathy (20.6% vs 1.6% for Rd), thrombocytopenia (17.2% vs 9.4% for Rd) and lymphopenia 
(18.7% vs 15.2% for Rd). 
The most commonly reported grades 3 or 4 ADRs in the integrated analysis for RVd were neutropenia 
(12.9% vs 2.3% for VTD), thrombocytopenia (6.3% vs 0% for VTD), infections (9.8% vs 0% for VTD) and 
neuropathy peripheral (3.3% vs 6.9% for VTD). 
Lenalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone (RVd) was associated with an increase in 
treatment-emergent SAEs (40.1% vs 28.5%) compared to lenalidomide in combination with 
dexamethasone (Rd), during the initial treatment phase of study SWOG S0777. These treatment-emergent 
SAEs are coherent with the known safety profile of lenalidomide and bortezomib.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In the SWOG S0777 study, RVd as initial treatment for NDMM in TNE patients was associated with a 
significant better survival benefit, in PFS such as in OS, and a better response rate of the disease than Rd. 
No new risks were identified for the combination of lenalidomide and bortezomib but there was an 
overlapping in some toxicities, which remained manageable. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In the TNE NDMM population, the efficacy of the RVd regimen is considered clinically relevant and the safety 
of such a combination manageable, the benefits are thus considered to outweight the combined risks. The 
overall B/R for Revlimid in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment 
of adult patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for transplant is positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The PETHEMA GEM2012 study was not designed to compare RVd regimen with the approved standard of 
care for induction in transplant-eligible patients (VD or VTD), but to compare two pre-transplant conditioning 
regimen after a similar induction by RVd. In addition, the study failed to demonstrate its primary objective 
as data were not mature with the chosen cut-off date to get enough events to reach PFS median. Similarly, 
the IFM 2009 study was not designed to compare RVd regimen with the approved standard of care for 
induction in transplant-eligible patients (VD or VTD), but to compare two therapeutic strategies using RVd as 
initial regimen treatment. The integrated analysis was based on the individual subject data from 4 identified 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Overall, for the transplant-eligible population, the design of the studies 
and the interpretation of the results of the integrated analysis do not allow to conclude on the superiority or 
non-inferiority in clinical efficacy of the RVd regimen compared to the standard of care. Therefore, the 
indication was restricted to patient with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for 
transplant. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Revlimid in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone of adult patients with 
previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for transplant is positive.

Extension of indication to include treatment with Revlimid in combination with bortezomib and 
dexamethasone of adult patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for 
transplant. As a consequence, the MAH submitted a request to add 7-capsule pack sizes for the 7.5 mg, 20 
mg and 25 mg strengths of Revlimid (lenalidomide) to support the proposed posology and lenalidomide dose 
modification. Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 6.5 and 8 of the SmPC are updated; the Package Leaflet is 
updated in accordance. Additionally, minor editorial changes have been introduced throughout the PI and 
annex II key elements of the RMM have been updated to include information on timing of blood and semen 
donation in line with the SmPC section 4.4. The RMP (version 36.4) has also been updated. 
The group of variations leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, Package 
Leaflet, Annex A and Labelling and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Revlimid is not similar to Ninlaro, Darzalex, Kyprolis, Farydak 
and Imnovid within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this group of variations. In particular the EPAR 
module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Myelosuppression 
Thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and anaemia occurred in patients receiving asciminib. Severe (NCI 
CTCAE grade 3 or 4) thrombocytopenia and neutropenia were reported during treatment with 
asciminib (see section 4.8). Myelosuppression was generally reversible and managed by temporarily 
withholding treatment. Complete blood counts should be performed every two weeks for the first 
3 months of treatment and then monthly thereafter, or as clinically indicated. Patients should be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of myelosuppression. 
Based on the severity of thrombocytopenia and/or neutropenia, the dose should be temporarily 
withheld, reduced or permanently discontinued as described in Table 1 (see section 4.2). 
Pancreatic toxicity 
Pancreatitis and asymptomatic elevations of serum lipase and amylase, including severe reactions, 
occurred in patients receiving asciminib (see section 4.8). 
Serum lipase and amylase levels should be assessed monthly during treatment with asciminib, or as 
clinically indicated. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of pancreatic toxicity. More 
frequent monitoring should be performed in patients with a history of pancreatitis. If serum lipase and 
amylase elevations are accompanied by abdominal symptoms, treatment should be temporarily 
withheld and appropriate diagnostic tests should be considered to exclude pancreatitis (see 
section 4.2). 
Based on the severity of serum lipase and amylase elevations, the dose should be temporarily 
withheld, reduced or permanently discontinued as described in Table 1 (see section 4.2). 
QT prolongation 
QT prolongation occurred in patients receiving asciminib (see section 4.8). 
It is recommended that an electrocardiogram is performed prior to the start of treatment with 
asciminib, and monitored during treatment as clinically indicated. Hypokalaemia and 
hypomagnesaemia should be corrected prior to asciminib administration and monitored during 
treatment as clinically indicated. 
Caution should be exercised when administering asciminib concomitantly with medicinal products 
with known risk of torsades de pointes (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hypertension 
Hypertension, including severe hypertension, occurred in patients receiving asciminib (see 
section 4.8). 
Hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors should be monitored regularly and managed using 
the standard therapies during treatment with asciminib. 
Hepatitis B reactivation 
Reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) has occurred in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus 
following administration of other BCR::ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Patients should be 
tested for HBV infection before the start of treatment with asciminib. HBV carriers who require 
treatment with asciminib should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection 
throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy. 
Lactose 
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or 
glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film-coated tablet, that is to say 
essentially “sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Medicinal products with known risk of torsades de pointes 
Caution should be exercised during concomitant administration of asciminib and medicinal products 
with known risk of torsades de pointes, including, but not limited to, bepridil, chloroquine, 
clarithromycin, halofantrine, haloperidol, methadone, moxifloxacin or pimozide (see section 5.1). 
Medicinal products that may decrease asciminib plasma concentrations 
Strong CYP3A4 inducers 
Co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampicin) decreased asciminib AUCinf by 15% and 
increased Cmax by 9% in healthy subjects receiving a single asciminib dose of 40 mg. 
Caution should be exercised during concomitant administration of asciminib with strong CYP3A4 
inducers, including, but not limited to, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin or St. John’s wort 
(Hypericum perforatum), which may result in lower efficacy of asciminib. 
Medicinal products that may have their plasma concentrations altered by asciminib 
CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic index 
Co-administration of asciminib with a CYP3A4 substrate (midazolam) increased midazolam AUCinf 
and Cmax by 28% and 11%, respectively, in healthy subjects receiving asciminib 40 mg twice daily. 
Caution should be exercised during concomitant administration of asciminib with CYP3A4 substrates 
known to have a narrow therapeutic index, including, but not limited to, the CYP3A4 substrates 
fentanyl, alfentanil, dihydroergotamine or ergotamine (see section 5.2). Dose adjustment of asciminib 
is not required. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CYP2C9 substrates 
Co-administration of asciminib with a CYP2C9 substrate (warfarin) increased S-warfarin AUCinf and 
Cmax by 41% and 8%, respectively, in healthy subjects receiving asciminib 40 mg twice daily. 
Caution should be exercised during concomitant administration of asciminib with CYP2C9 substrates 
known to have a narrow therapeutic index, including, but not limited to, phenytoin or warfarin (see 
section 5.2). Dose adjustment of asciminib is not required. 
OATP1B, BCRP substrates or substrates of both transporters 
Based on PBPK modelling, caution should be exercised during concomitant administration of 
asciminib with substrates of OATP1B, BCRP or both transporters, including, but not limited to 
sulfasalazine, methotrexate, pravastatin, atorvastatin, pitavastatin, rosuvastatin and simvastatin. No 
clinical drug interaction study was performed. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception 
The pregnancy status of women of childbearing potential should be verified prior to starting treatment 
with asciminib. 
Sexually-active women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception (methods that 
result in less than 1% pregnancy rates) during treatment with asciminib and for at least 3 days after 
stopping treatment. 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of asciminib in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Asciminib is not recommended during 
pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. The patient should be 
advised of a potential risk to the foetus if asciminib is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes 
pregnant while taking asciminib. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether asciminib/metabolites are excreted in human milk. There are no data on the 
effects of asciminib on the breast-fed newborn/infant or on milk production. Because of the potential 
for serious adverse reactions in the breast-fed newborn/infant, breast-feeding should be discontinued 
during treatment and for at least 3 days after stopping treatment with asciminib. 
Fertility 
There are no data on the effect of asciminib on human fertility. In rat fertility studies, asciminib did 
not affect reproductive function in male and female rats. However, adverse effects on sperm motility 
and count were observed in rats at doses of 200 mg/kg/day (see section 5.3). The relevance for humans 
is not known. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Asciminib has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, it is 
recommended that patients experiencing dizziness, fatigue or other undesirable effects (see 
section 4.8) with a potential impact on the ability to drive or use machines safely should refrain from 
these activities as long as the undesirable effects persist.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Myelosuppression 
Thrombocytopenia occurred in 27.5% of patients receiving asciminib, with grade 3 and 4 reactions 
reported in 6.7% and 11.8% of patients, respectively. Among the patients with thrombocytopenia 
≥ grade 3, the median time to first occurrence of reactions was 6 weeks (range: 0.14 to 64 weeks), with 
median duration of any occurring reaction of 1.71 weeks (95% CI, range: 1.43 to 2 weeks). 2% of 
patients receiving asciminib permanently discontinued due to thrombocytopenia, while asciminib was 
temporarily withheld in 12.6% of patients due to the adverse reaction. 
Neutropenia occurred in 19.4% of patients receiving asciminib, with grade 3 and 4 reactions reported 
in 7.3% and 8.4% of patients, respectively. Among the patients with neutropenia ≥ grade 3, the median 
time to first occurrence of reactions was 6 weeks (range: 0.14 to 180 weeks), with median duration of 
any occurring reaction of 1.79 weeks (95% CI, range: 1.29 to 2 weeks). 1.1% of patients receiving 
asciminib permanently discontinued due to neutropenia, while asciminib was temporarily withheld in 
9.6% of patients due to the adverse reaction. 
Anaemia occurred in 12.9% of patients receiving asciminib, with grade 3 reactions occurring in 5.3%

0.9 weeks (95% CI, range: 0.43 to 2.14 weeks). Asciminib was temporarily withheld in 0.6% of 
patients due to the adverse reaction. 
Pancreatic toxicity 
Pancreatitis occurred in 2.5% of patients receiving asciminib, with grade 3 reactions occurring in 1.1% 
of patients. All these reactions occurred in the phase I study (X2101). 0.6% of patients receiving 
asciminib permanently discontinued due to pancreatitis, while asciminib was temporarily withheld in 
1.1% of patients due to the adverse reaction. Asymptomatic elevations of serum lipase and amylase 
occurred in 21.3% of patients receiving asciminib, with grade 3 and 4 reactions occurring in 10.1% 
and 2.2% of patients, respectively. Of the patients with elevation of pancreatic enzymes, asciminib 
was permanently discontinued in 2.2% of patients due to the adverse reaction. 
QT prolongation 
Electrocardiogram QT prolongation occurred in 0.8% of patients receiving asciminib. In the 
ASCEMBL clinical study, one patient had a prolonged QTcF greater than 500 milliseconds (ms) 
together with more than 60 ms QTcF increase from baseline, and one patient had prolonged QTcF 
with more than 60 ms QTcF increase from baseline. 
Hypertension 
Hypertension occurred in 18.5% of patients receiving asciminib, with grade 3 and 4 reactions reported 
in 8.4% and 0.3% of patients, respectively. Among the patients with hypertension ≥ grade 3, the 
median time to first occurrence of reactions was 14 weeks (range: 0.1 to 156 weeks). Asciminib was 
temporarily withheld in 0.8% of patients due to the adverse reaction. 
Laboratory abnormalities 
Decrease in phosphate levels occurred as a laboratory abnormality in 17.9% (all grades) and 6.4% 
(grade 3/4) of 156 patients receiving asciminib at 40 mg twice daily. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.9  Overdose 
In clinical studies, asciminib has been administered at doses up to 280 mg twice daily with no 
evidence of increased toxicity. 
General supportive measures and symptomatic treatment should be initiated in cases of suspected 
overdose.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EA06 
Mechanism of action 
Asciminib is a potent inhibitor of ABL/BCR::ABL1 tyrosine kinase. Asciminib inhibits the ABL1 
kinase activity of the BCR::ABL1 fusion protein by specifically targeting the ABL myristoyl pocket. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
In vitro, asciminib inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of ABL1 at mean IC50 values below 
3 nanomolar. In patient-derived cancer cells, asciminib specifically inhibits the proliferation of cells 
harbouring BCR::ABL1 with IC50 values between 1 and 25 nanomolar. In cells engineered to express 
either the wild-type or the T315I mutant form of BCR::ABL1, asciminib inhibits cell growth with 
mean IC50 values of 0.61 ± 0.21 and 7.64 ± 3.22 nanomolar, respectively. 
In mouse xenograft models of CML, asciminib dose-dependently inhibited the growth of tumours 
harbouring either the wild-type or the T315I mutant form of BCR::ABL1, with tumour regression 
being observed at doses above 7.5 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg twice daily, respectively. 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
Asciminib treatment is associated with an exposure-related prolongation of the QT interval. 
The correlation between asciminib concentration and the estimated mean change from baseline of the 
QT interval with Fridericia’s correction (ΔQTcF) was evaluated in 239 patients with Ph+ CML or Ph+ 
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) receiving asciminib at doses ranging from 10 to 280 mg twice 
daily and 80 to 200 mg once daily. The estimated mean ΔQTcF was 3.35 ms (upper bound of 90% CI: 
4.43 ms) for the asciminib 40 mg twice-daily dose. See section 4.4. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Ph+ CML-CP 
The clinical efficacy and safety of asciminib in the treatment of patients with Philadelphia 
chromosome-positive myeloid leukaemia in chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP) with treatment failure or 
intolerance to two or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors were evaluated in the multicentre, randomised, 
active-controlled and open-label phase III study ASCEMBL. Resistance to last TKI was defined as 
any of the following: failure to achieve either haematological or cytogenetic response at 3 months; 
BCR::ABL1 (on the International Scale, IS) >10% at 6 months or thereafter; >65% Ph+ metaphases at 
6 months or >35% at 12 months or thereafter; loss of complete haematological response (CHR), partial 
cytogenetic response (PCyR), complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) or major molecular response 
(MMR) at any time; new BCR::ABL1 mutations which potentially cause resistance to study medicinal 
product or clonal evolution in Ph+ metaphases at any time. Intolerance to last TKI was defined as 
non-haematological toxicities unresponsive to optimal management, or as haematological toxicities 
recurring after dose reduction to the lowest recommended dose. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this study, a total of 233 patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio and stratified according to major 
cytogenetic response (MCyR) status at baseline to receive either asciminib 40 mg twice daily (N=157) 
or bosutinib 500 mg once daily (N=76). Patients with known presence of T315I and/or V299L 
mutations at any time prior to study entry were not included in ASCEMBL. Patients continued 
treatment until unacceptable toxicity or treatment failure occurred. 
Patients with Ph+ CML-CP were 51.5% female and 48.5% male, with median age 52 years (range: 19 
to 83 years). Of the 233 patients, 18.9% were 65 years or older, while 2.6% were 75 years or older. 
Patients were Caucasian (74.7%), Asian (14.2%) and Black (4.3%). Of the 233 patients, 80.7% and 
18% had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1, respectively. 
Patients who had previously received 2, 3, 4, 5 or more prior lines of TKIs were 48.1%, 31.3%, 14.6% 
and 6%, respectively. 
The median duration of the randomised treatment was 103 weeks (range: 0.1 to 201 weeks) for 
patients receiving asciminib and 31 weeks (range: 1 to 188 weeks) for patients receiving bosutinib. 
Results 
The primary endpoint of the study was MMR rate at 24 weeks and the key secondary endpoint was 
MMR rate at 96 weeks. MMR is defined as BCR::ABL1 IS ratio ≤0.1%. Other secondary endpoints 
were CCyR rate at 24 and 96 weeks, defined as no Philadelphia-positive metaphases in bone marrow 
with a minimum of 20 metaphases examined. 
The main efficacy outcomes from the ASCEMBL study are summarised in Table 3.

The primary and key secondary endpoints were the only ones formally tested for statistical 
significance according to protocol. 
In ASCEMBL, 12.7% of patients treated with asciminib and 13.2% of patients receiving bosutinib had 
one or more BCR::ABL1 mutations detected at baseline. MMR at 24 weeks was observed in 35.3% 
and 24.8% of patients receiving asciminib with or without any BCR::ABL1 mutation at baseline, 
respectively. MMR at 24 weeks was observed in 25% and 11.1% of patients receiving bosutinib with 
or without any mutation at baseline, respectively. The MMR rate at 24 weeks in patients in whom the 
randomised treatment represented the third, fourth, or fifth or more line of TKI was 29.3%, 25%, and 
16.1% in patients treated with asciminib and 20%, 13.8%, and 0% in patients receiving bosutinib, 
respectively. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Kaplan-Meier estimated proportion of patients receiving asciminib and maintaining MMR for at 
least 72 weeks was 96.7% (95% CI: 87.4, 99.2). 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Scemblix in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in CML (see section 4.2 for information 
on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Asciminib is rapidly absorbed, with median maximum plasma level (Tmax) reached 2 to 3 hours after 
oral administration, independent of the dose. The geometric mean (geoCV%) of Cmax and AUCtau at 
steady state is 793 ng/ml (49%) and 5262 ng*h/ml (48%), respectively, following administration of 
asciminib at the 40 mg twice-daily dose. PBPK models predict that asciminib absorption is 
approximately 100%, while bioavailability is approximately 73%. 
Asciminib bioavailability may be reduced by co-administration of oral medicinal products containing 
hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin as an excipient. Co-administration of multiple doses of an itraconazole 
oral solution containing hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin at a total of 8 g per dose with a 40 mg dose of 
asciminib decreased asciminib AUCinf by 40.2% in healthy subjects. 
Food effect 
Food consumption decreases asciminib bioavailability, with a high-fat meal having a higher impact on 
asciminib pharmacokinetics than a low-fat meal. Asciminib AUC is decreased by 62.3% with a 
high-fat meal and by 30% with a low-fat meal compared to the fasted state (see section 4.2). 
Distribution 
Asciminib apparent volume of distribution at steady state is 111 litres based on population 
pharmacokinetic analysis. Asciminib is mainly distributed to plasma, with a mean blood-to-plasma 
ratio of 0.58, independent of the dose based on in vitro data. Asciminib is 97.3% bound to human 
plasma proteins, independent of the dose. 
Biotransformation 
Asciminib is primarily metabolised via CYP3A4-mediated oxidation, and UGT2B7- and 
UGT2B17-mediated glucuronidation. Asciminib is the main circulating component in plasma (92.7% 
of the administered dose). 
Elimination 
Asciminib is mainly eliminated via faecal excretion, with a minor contribution of the renal route. 
Eighty and 11% of the asciminib dose were recovered in the faeces and in the urine of healthy 
subjects, respectively, following oral administration of a single 80 mg dose of [14C]-labelled 
asciminib. Faecal elimination of unchanged asciminib accounts for 56.7% of the administered dose. 
Asciminib is eliminated by biliary secretion via breast cancer-resistant protein (BCRP). 
The oral total clearance (CL/F) of asciminib is 6.31 l/hour after 40 mg twice daily, based on 
population pharmacokinetic analysis. The elimination half-life of asciminib is between 7 and 15 hours 
at 40 mg twice daily. 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Asciminib exhibits a slight dose over-proportional increase in steady-state exposure (AUC and Cmax) 
across the dose range of 10 to 200 mg administered once or twice daily. 
The geometric mean accumulation ratio is approximately 2-fold. Steady-state conditions are achieved 
within 3 days at the 40 mg twice-daily dose. 
In vitro evaluation of drug interaction potential 
Asciminib is metabolised by several pathways, including the CYP3A4, UGT2B7 and UGT2B17 
enzymes, and biliary secreted by the transporter BCRP. Medicinal products inhibiting or inducing the 
CYP3A4, UGT and/or BCRP pathways may alter asciminib exposure. 
CYP450 and UGT enzymes 
In vitro, asciminib reversibly inhibits CYP3A4/5, CYP2C9 and UGT1A1 at plasma concentrations 
reached at a 40 mg twice-daily dose. Asciminib may increase the exposure of medicinal products 
which are substrates of CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C9 (see section 4.5). 
Transporters 
Asciminib is a substrate of BCRP and P-gp. 
Asciminib inhibits BCRP, P-gp and OATP1B with Ki values of 24, 22 and 2 micromolar, respectively. 
Based on PBPK models, asciminib may increase the exposure of medicinal products which are 
substrates of these transporters. 
Special populations 
Gender, race, body weight 
Asciminib systemic exposure is not affected by gender, race or body weight to any clinically relevant 
extent. 
Renal impairment 
A dedicated renal impairment study including 6 subjects with normal renal function (absolute 
glomerular filtration rate [aGFR] ≥90 ml/min) and 8 subjects with severe renal impairment not 
requiring dialysis (aGFR 15 to <30 ml/min) has been conducted. Asciminib AUCinf and Cmax were 
increased by 56% and 8%, respectively, in subjects with severe renal impairment compared to subjects 
with normal renal function, following oral administration of a single 40 mg dose of asciminib (see 
section 4.2). Population pharmacokinetic models indicate an increase in asciminib median steady-state 
AUC0-24h by 11.5% in subjects with mild to moderate renal impairment, compared to subjects with 
normal renal function. 
Hepatic impairment 
A dedicated hepatic impairment study including 8 subjects each with normal hepatic function, mild 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A score 5-6), moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B score 7-9) 
or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C score 10-15) was conducted. Asciminib AUCinf was 
increased by 22%, 3% and 66% in subjects with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment, 
respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function, following oral administration of a 
single 40 mg dose of asciminib (see section 4.2).

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Safety pharmacology 
Moderate cardiovascular effects (increased heart rate, decreased systolic pressure, decreased mean 
arterial pressure, and decreased arterial pulse pressure) were observed in in vivo cardiac safety studies 
in dogs, likely at AUC exposures 12-fold higher than those achieved in patients at the recommended 
dose (RD) of 40 mg twice daily. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Pancreatic effects (serum amylase and lipase increases, acinar cell lesions) occurred in dogs at AUC 
exposures below those achieved in patients at the RD of 40 mg twice daily. A trend towards recovery 
was observed. 
Elevations in liver enzymes and/or bilirubin were observed in rats, dogs and monkeys. 
Histopathological hepatic changes (centrilobular hepatocyte hypertrophy, slight bile duct hyperplasia, 
increased individual hepatocyte necrosis and diffuse hepatocellular hypertrophy) were seen in rats and 
monkeys. These changes occurred at AUC exposures either equivalent to (rats) or 12- to 18-fold (dogs 
and monkeys, respectively) higher than those achieved in patients at the RD of 40 mg twice daily. 
These changes were fully reversible. 
Effects on the haematopoietic system (reduction in red blood cell mass, increased splenic or bone 
marrow pigment and increased reticulocytes) were consistent with a mild and regenerative, 
extravascular, haemolytic anaemia in all species. These changes occurred at AUC exposures either 
equivalent to (rats) or 12- to 14-fold (dogs and monkeys, respectively) higher than those achieved in 
patients at the RD of 40 mg twice daily. These changes were fully reversible. 
Minimal mucosal hypertrophy/hyperplasia (increase in thickness of the mucosa with frequent 
elongation of villi) was present in the duodenum of rats at AUC exposures 30-fold higher than those 
achieved in patients at the RD of 40 mg twice daily. This change was fully reversible. 
Minimal or slight hypertrophy of the adrenal gland and mild to moderate decreased vacuolation in the 
zona fasciculata occurred at AUC exposures either equivalent to (monkeys) or 19-fold (rats) higher 
than those achieved in patients at the RD of 40 mg twice daily. These changes were fully reversible. 
Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity 
Asciminib did not have mutagenic, clastogenic or aneugenic potential either in vitro nor in vivo. 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with asciminib. 
Reproductive toxicity 
Animal reproduction studies in pregnant rats and rabbits demonstrated that oral administration of 
asciminib during organogenesis induced embryotoxicity, foetotoxicity and teratogenicity. 
In embryo-foetal development studies, a slight increase in foetal malformations (anasarca and cardiac 
malformations) and increased visceral and skeletal variants were observed in rats. Increased incidence 
of resorptions indicative of embryo-foetal mortality and a low incidence of cardiac malformations 
indicative of teratogenicity were observed in rabbits. In rats, at the foetal no observed adverse effect 
level (NOAEL) of 25 mg/kg/day, the AUC exposures were equivalent to those achieved in patients at 
the RD of 40 mg twice daily. In rabbits, at the foetal NOAEL of 15 mg/kg/day, the AUC exposures 
were equivalent to those achieved in patients at the RD of 40 mg twice daily. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the rat fertility study, asciminib did not affect reproductive function in male and female rats. A 
slight effect on male sperm motility and sperm count was observed at doses of 200 mg/kg/day, likely 
at AUC exposures 19-fold higher than those achieved in patients at the RD of 40 mg twice daily. 
A pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity study was not performed. 
Phototoxicity 
In mice, asciminib showed dose-dependent phototoxic effects starting at 200 mg/kg/day. At the 
NOAEL of 60 mg/kg/day, exposure based on Cmax in plasma was 15-fold higher than the exposure in 
patients at the RD of 40 mg twice daily.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Scemblix is and what it is used for 
What Scemblix is 
Scemblix contains the active substance asciminib, which belongs to a group of medicines called 
protein kinase inhibitors. 
What Scemblix is used for 
Scemblix is a cancer medicine used to treat adults with a type of blood cancer (leukaemia) called 
Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukaemia in chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP). It is 
given to patients who were previously treated with two or more cancer medicines called tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors. 
How Scemblix works 
In Ph+ CML, the body produces large numbers of abnormal white blood cells. Scemblix blocks the 
action of a protein (BCR::ABL1) that is produced by these abnormal white blood cells and stops their 
division and growth. 
If you have any questions about how this medicine works or why this medicine has been prescribed for 
you, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Scemblix 
Do not take Scemblix 
- 
if you are allergic to asciminib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).

Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Scemblix if any of the following applies to you: 
- 
if you have or have ever had severe upper stomach pain that could be due to problems with your 
pancreas (inflamed pancreas, pancreatitis). 
if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Scemblix could 
cause hepatitis B to become active again. You will be carefully checked by your doctor for signs 
of this infection before treatment is started. 
- 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you get any of the following during treatment 
with Scemblix: 
- 
if you experience weakness, spontaneous bleeding or bruising and frequent infections with signs 
such as fever, chills, sore throat or mouth ulcers. These can be signs of decreased bone marrow 
activity, resulting in myelosuppression (a reduction in the number of white blood cells, red 
blood cells and platelets). 
if blood tests show that you have high levels of enzymes called lipase and amylase (signs of 
damage to the pancreas, also known as pancreatic toxicity). 
if you have a heart disorder or a heart rhythm disorder, such as an irregular heartbeat or an 
abnormal electrical activity of the heart called QT interval prolongation that can be seen on an 
electrocardiogram (ECG). 
if blood tests show that you have a low level of potassium or magnesium (hypokalaemia or 
hypomagnesaemia). 
if you are being treated with medicines that may have an unwanted effect on the function of the 
heart (torsades de pointes) (see “Other medicines and Scemblix”). 
if you experience headache, dizziness, chest pain or shortness of breath (possible signs of high 
blood pressure, also known as hypertension).

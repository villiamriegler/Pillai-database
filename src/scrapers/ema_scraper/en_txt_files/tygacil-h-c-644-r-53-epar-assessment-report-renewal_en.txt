2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Tygacil (tigecycline) belongs to the glycylcycline class of antimicrobial agents. As a bacteriostatic 
agent, with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, it inhibits the growth of multiple resistant gram-
positive, gram-negative, anaerobic, and atypical bacteria, including methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus.  
It was authorized in the EU through the centralized procedure on 24 Apr 2006, where it is currently 
approved for the following indications: 
• Complicated skin and soft tissue infections, excluding diabetic foot infections (cSSSI) 
• Complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) 
A variation application to extend the therapeutic indications to include treatment of community 
acquired pneumonia (CAP) was withdrawn in the EU in April 2008. 
Tygacil is available in single-dose 5-mL glass vials containing 50 mg lyophilized powder for infusion.  
2.2.  Quality 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder has confirmed that the quality, with respect to the method of 
preparation and control, has been regularly updated by variations to take account of technical and 
scientific progress in accordance with article 16(1) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and that the 
product conforms to current CHMP quality guidelines.  
It has been confirmed that no changes were made to the product particulars other than those 
approved by the Competent Authority. 
Several quality changes relating to the tigecycline active substance have been introduced since the 
approval. Most of these changes were minor in nature type I variations (A and B) and concerned 
manufacturing process, in-process controls and updates of certificates of suitability for the starting 
material used in the manufacturing process of tigecycline. Furthermore analytical procedures and 
specification for the drug substance have been modified and the re-test period of the active substance 
has been extended. 
Composition of the finished product was changed and three additional excipients have been added to 
the reformulated medicinal product, i.e., lactose monohydrate, sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric 
acid. As a consequence, the manufacturing process has changed, together with the in-process controls 
and the specifications of the finished product. In addition, minor changes to the container closure 
system were introduced. Further changes to the manufacturing process of the finished product have 
been introduced and the in-process controls and parameters for the finished product have been 
updated to include an in process colour test.  
No stability problems have been encountered for the finished product and the shelf-life and storage 
conditions continue to be fully supported.

Addition compatibility studies have been performed for the product, which resulted in the update of the 
product information. Sections 6.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC were updated to include information on 
incompatibility of Tygacil solution with esomeprazole, and solutions for infusion that exhibit a pH above 
7 (that can be anticipated for omeprazole solutions for infusion) and compatibility with 
metoclopramide. The PIL was updated accordingly. Furthermore section 6.6 of the SmPC "Special 
precautions for disposal and other handling" and section 6 of the PIL "Instructions for use and 
handling", were updated to include Lactated Ringer's solution for injection as a reconstitution solution 
and compatible intravenous solution, and to update the information on compatibility for Tygacil diluted 
in dextrose 50 mg/ml (5 %) solution for injection, when administered through a Y-site. 
All the relevant sites of manufacture and testing are undergoing regular GMP inspections by an EEA 
competent authority or MRA partner authority and satisfactory GMP compliance of these sites has been 
confirmed by the MAH by submission of the appropriate documentation.  
Appropriate declarations have been submitted concerning the GMP compliance status of the active 
substance manufacturers. 
The quality of this product continues to be considered acceptable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical 
The MAH confirmed that no new non-clinical data which would impact the benefit-risk balance are 
available since the granting of the initial marketing authorisation. No additional publication or non-
clinical studies have been submitted with this application 
At the time of the MA the MAH agreed to undertake a number of nonclinical follow-up measures (FUMs) 
concerning results of genetic toxicology studies of relevant human metabolites, degradation products 
and a T-cell dependent antibody response (TDAR) immune function study; the requested data have 
been submitted and these FUMs have been considered fulfilled; there are no outstanding non-clinical 
FUMs. 
2.4.  Clinical pharmacology  
This section discusses clinical pharmacology data that has become available since the marketing 
authorisation. 
2207-WW: Pharmacokinetics of tigecycline in paediatric subjects 
Study 2207-WW was a phase 2, multicenter, open-label, ascending multiple-dose study conducted to 
evaluate tigecycline exposures at dosages of 0.75, 1, and 1.25 mg/kg administered every 12 hours in 
children aged 8 to 11 years with complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI), complicated skin and 
skin structure infection (cSSSI), or community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Qualifying subjects received 
intravenous (IV) tigecycline for a minimum of 3 days to a maximum of 14 consecutive days. The study 
objective was to identify an appropriate dose regimen of tigecycline for children aged 8 to 11 years old 
to be tested in phase 3 clinical trials. 
Fifty-eight (58) subjects received at least 1 dose of tigecycline and were included in the modified 
intent-to-treat (mITT) population. A total of 51 of 58 subjects (87.9%) completed the study and 7 
(12.1%) discontinued from the study.  
Concentrations decreased quickly after the end of the infusion, followed by distribution to a large 
volume and relatively low clearance. Administration of larger doses resulted in proportional increases 
in Cmax and AUCτ. Smaller, younger children had lower CL than larger older children; however, no 
relationship was shown between CLW and weight, body mass index (BMI), or age. No relationship was

EMA/CHMP/183367/2011  
Page 5/28
 
 
 
 
shown between CL or CLW and height, sex, or race. No difference in CLW was observed for children 
with different infections. 
The CSR was submitted in April 2010 in accordance to Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation and is 
currently under assessment. The evaluation is still on going as additional data related to PK and safety 
has been requested. In addition the MAH has been requested to submit a type II variation to update 
section 5.2 of the SmPC with information on PK in the paediatric population. 
119-US: Pharmacokinetics of tigecycline in human bone 
Study 119 was an open-label, nonrandomized study of multiple doses of tigecycline administered to 
healthy subjects who were scheduled to undergo a planned bone/joint surgery or procedure. Each 
subject received 3 IV doses of tigecycline as 30-minute infusions; dose 1 was 100 mg, dose 2 was 50 
mg, and dose 3 was 50 mg. Thirty-three healthy men and non-lactating and non-pregnant women, 
aged 18 years or older, were enrolled in the study, received at least 1 dose of tigecycline, and 
comprised the safety population. All 33 subjects completed the study.  
The serum PK results observed in this study were consistent with what has been reported for other 
healthy volunteers at steady-state. Tigecycline penetrates into bone, with bone to serum ratios greater 
than 1 observed at all measured time points following dose 3. The average bone concentration of 
tigecycline was 898 ng/g, and the ratio of bone and serum AUC0-τ values was 4.77. 
The CHMP antibacterial guideline states “Since there are methodological and interpretation problems 
associated with assays in whole tissues (e.g. homogenates) such studies are not generally helpful; 
however, drug concentrations at special sites (e.g. concentrations in the CSF) are useful and 
distribution studies in some other tissue fluids may be valuable”. Overall the above study shows that 
tigecycline is distributed to bone. However the clinical study of tigecycline in patients with diabetic foot 
infections (DFI) with or without osteomyelitis was negative; this information was included in the SmPC 
in April 2010 following submission of the study results. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy and safety  
2.5.1.  Clinical efficacy 
Since Tygacil marketing authorisation, the MAH completed 1 Phase 3 study in complicated intra-
abdominal infections and 3 postmarketing studies in the approved indications.  
316-CN: Phase 3 study in Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections in chinese 
patients  
Study 316-CN was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, open-label comparison study conducted in 
China. The primary objective was to compare the safety and efficacy of tigecycline to 
imipenem/cilastatin in the treatment of Chinese patients with cIAI. Secondary objectives included 
obtaining in vitro susceptibility data on tigecycline for a range of bacteria that cause cIAI and to 
compare microbiologic efficacy of tigecycline with that of imipenem/cilastatin. Men or women 18 years 
of age or older with a cIAI were eligible. Tigecycline was administered every 12 hours (an initial IV 
dose of 100 mg followed by 50 mg every 12 hours). Imipenem/cilastatin was administered every 6 
hours.  
The primary endpoint of the study was the clinical response at the test-of-cure (TOC) assessment in 
the microbiologically evaluable (ME) and microbiologic modified intent-to-treat (m-mITT) populations. 
Patients were evaluated daily while receiving the test article and again at the post-therapy follow-up 
visits. Clinical response was determined by the investigator as cure, failure, or indeterminate. 
Secondary endpoints included microbiologic response at the subject level, microbiologic response at 
CHMP renewal assessment report

the pathogen level, for overall and resistant pathogens, clinical cure rates by baseline isolate, response 
rates for patients with polymicrobial infections and monomicrobial infections, decreased susceptibility, 
response rates by baseline isolate and MIC values, and susceptibility data by isolate.  
The current study was designed to be descriptive and not powered to show non-inferiority versus the 
active comparator. Therefore, clinical responses were not analyzed for non-inferiority of tigecycline to 
imipenem/ cilastatin.  
Overall, the results showed similar response rates to that observed in the phase 3 pivotal studies.  In 
the ME population, 45 out of 52 (86.5%) tigecycline patients and 47 out of 48 (97.9%) 
imipenem/cilastatin patients were considered clinical cures at the primary endpoint, the TOC 
assessment. The clinical cure rates in the m-mITT population for tigecycline and imipenem/cilastatin 
patients were 81.7% (49 of 60) and 90.9% (50 of 55) respectively. Although it was not powered to 
test non-inferiority of tigecycline versus imipenem/cilastatin, tigecycline-treated patients had cure 
rates at the TOC that were lower than those observed for imipenem being the point estimate for the 
difference in cure proportion in the ME population 11.4% (95% CI -23,5%, 0.7%) in favour of the 
comparator.  
With regards to the microbiologic responses at subject level, eradication rates were similar to clinical 
cure rates observed. In the ME population, the baseline organisms were eradicated in 45 of 52 
(86.5%) tigecycline patients and 47 of 48 (97.9%) patients treated with imipenem/cilastatin at the 
TOC.  The 95% CI for the tigecycline group was (74.2, 94.4); the 95% CI for the imipenem/cilastatin 
group was (88.9, 99.9). In the m-mITT population, the baseline organisms were eradicated in 49 of 60 
(81.7%) patients treated with tigecycline (95% CI, 69.6, 90.5) and 50 of 55 (90.9%) patients treated 
with imipenem/cilastatin (95% CI, 80.0, 97.0) at the TOC assessment. These differences were less 
marked. 
Among the ME patients with monomicrobial infections, 30 of 33 (90.9% [75.7, 98.1]) patients in the 
tigecycline group versus 25 of 26 (96.2% [80.4, 99.9]) patients in the imipenem/ cilastatin group were 
clinically cured at the TOC assessment; however, among ME patients with polymicrobial infections, 15 
of 19 (78.9% [95% CI 54.4, 93.9]) patients in the tigecycline group versus 22 of 22 (100% [95% CI 
84.6, 100.0]) patients in the imipenem/cilastatin group were clinically cured at the TOC assessment.  
Clinical responses at the ME subgroup level, were compared on the basis of the following baseline 
characteristics: age, sex, ethnicity, clinical diagnosis, and CLCR. In addition, a subgroup analysis of 
patients with bacteremia was also performed. No unusual findings were observed although the number 
of patients in each subgroup was too small. 
Overall, the limitations of the study are acknowledged since it was not powered to establish non-
inferiority. However the study results indicate that, despite the small sample size, there is a trend in 
favour of the comparator in cIAI, even in situations where patients have relatively low APACHE scores 
(mean APACHE II score was 4.25 in tigecycline-treated patients and 3.79 in comparator-treated 
patients, and no patients had APACHE scores ≥15). 
315-WW and 400-WW: Phase 4 studies in Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections  
Study 315-WW was a phase 4, randomized, open-label, comparative, multicenter study conducted in 
Europe, South Africa, the Middle East, and the Asia Pacific region. Study 400-WW was a phase 4, 
CHMP renewal assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/183367/2011  
Page 7/28
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
randomized, open-label, comparative, multicenter study conducted in North and South America. As 
these studies had a similar design, an integrated analysis of efficacy was performed.  
The primary objective was to compare the safety and clinical efficacy of tigecycline to ceftriaxone 
sodium plus metronidazole for the treatment of hospitalized patients with cIAI. Secondary objectives 
included comparing the microbiologic efficacy, evaluating in vitro susceptibility data of tigecycline for a 
range of pathogenic bacteria that cause cIAI, and comparing healthcare use between the treatment 
groups. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 fashion to receive either tigecycline every 12 hours 
IV (an initial dose of 100 mg followed by 50 mg every 12 hours) or ceftriaxone sodium 2 g once daily 
IV plus metronidazole 1 g to 2 g daily in divided doses IV, administered for a minimum of 4 days and 
up to 14 days.  
The primary efficacy variable was the clinical response in the clinically evaluable (CE) population. In 
both trials, the objective was to show the non-inferiority of tigecycline vs. comparator using a delta of 
15% at the test-of-cure (TOC) assessment.  
The clinical diagnosis categories considered in these trials were complicated appendicitis, complicated 
cholecystitis, complicated diverticulitis, intra-abdominal abscess (including liver and spleen), peritonitis 
(excluding spontaneous bacterial peritonitis), gastric and duodenal perforations, and perforation of the 
intestines (large, small, traumatic). 
The comparator group in both trials was ceftriaxone/metronidazole that was chosen based on its use 
worldwide for therapy of cIAI. According to the IDSA guidelines, it is a combination regimen commonly 
used for the treatment of community acquired cIAI of mild to moderate severity. In both studies, most 
patients had APACHE II scores less than 10 and the overall severity of illness was moderate, therefore 
the selected comparator is acceptable considering the study objective.  
Overall, the design of both trials is in agreement with current guidelines and similar to the phase 3 
studies submitted with the marketing authorization application.  
Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were similar between the treatment groups in each 
study. They were also similar between studies except for some differences in weight, BMI and 
emergency operation. Patients in study 400 had higher weight and BMI that in study 315.  
Infection type, etiology of disease, and comorbid conditions were comparable between treatment 
groups in each study and between studies. The most common clinical diagnosis in both studies was 
complicated appendicitis (48% in study 315 and 52% in study 400). Therefore, limited data from 
severe patients are available, similarly to what was observed in the registration trials.  
Clinical response 
In the integrated analysis of clinical response from both trials, tigecycline met the statistical criterion of 
non-inferiority, based on a non-inferiority margin of 15%, to ceftriaxone/metronidazole at the TOC 
assessment (the primary endpoint) and at the EOT assessment in the CE population. In the CE 
population, at the TOC assessment: 295/387 (76.2%) tigecycline-treated patients and 289/376 
(76.9%) ceftriaxone/metronidazole-treated patients were clinically cured. In the CE population, at the 
EOT assessment: 313/387 (80.9%) tigecycline-treated patients and 315/376 (83.8%) 
ceftriaxone/metronidazole-treated patients were clinically cured. The lower bound of the 95% CI was -
6.8% overall at the TOC assessment and -8.5% overall at the EOT assessment (the adjusted upper 
bounds were 5.3% and 2.4%, respectively). 
The MAH also provided the results of clinical response for the ME population and microbiological 
response at the subject and pathogen level (ME and m-mITT) as secondary efficacy variables. In 
addition, the MAH performed secondary analyses for these two variables (e.g. clinical and 
microbiological responses for monomicrobial vs. polymicrobial infections, clinical response by baseline 
CHMP renewal assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/183367/2011  
Page 8/28
 
 
 
 
isolate and by MIC values). Exploratory analyses of other factors that could affect the clinical response 
to tigecycline and the differences between treatment groups were also provided. These subgroups 
considered baseline characteristics such as APACHE II score, age, sex, ethnicity, geographic region, 
clinical diagnosis, ClCr, prior antibiotic failure status, and concomitant bacteremia.  
When individual study information was obtained from the Clinical Study Reports, differences were seen 
between both trials in the clinical response for almost all the efficacy variables; however, no 
comparison between results obtained in each study was made by the MAH. For the primary efficacy 
analysis, the overall difference in clinical response between treatments and for each study is shown in 
the table below: 
DIFFERENCE (TIGECYCLINE- CEFTRIAXONE/METRONIDAZOLE) 
 Clinical Response (rate of success)*  p-value % (95% CI) 
Study 315 
Study 400 
In CE population 
2.4 (-5.6, 10.5)  p=0.000 
-4.0 (-13.1, 5.1) p=0.009 
In ME population 
1.8 (-8.8, 12.5) p=0.001 
-3.4 (14.5, 7.8) p=0.020 
* Negative differences are indicative of better response in the comparator arm.  
In both studies the criterion for non-inferiority was met as the lower bound of the 95% CI for the 
difference between groups was within the predefined non-inferiority margin of -15%. However, the 
clinical responses observed in study 400 were lower than those observed in study 315 to the extent 
that in study 315 the clinical response rate difference was in favour of tigecycline and in study 400 was 
in favour of ceftriaxone/metronidazole. Only study 315 reached the non-inferiority margin of -10% 
recommended in the CHMP Guideline on the evaluation on antibacterials.  
It was observed that a possible predictor for failure was the APACHE II score.  Comparing the clinical 
response rates by APACHE II score strata in each study for tigecycline and ceftriaxone/metronidazole, 
response rates were lower for both treatments in study 400 than in study 315, although these 
differences are more pronounced for tigecycline than for ceftriaxone/metronidazole.  
The MAH performed several exploratory sensitivity analyses of clinical response by clinical diagnosis. In 
principle, the results seem to be consistent with the main analysis, though they should be interpreted 
with caution due to limited size of some strata. 
Microbiological response 
In study 315 the percentage of eradications at TOC in the ME population was 82.4% in the tigecycline 
group vs. 79.8 % in ceftriaxone/metronidazole group, 95% CI for the unadjusted difference: -7.9, 
13.3. In study 400, the percentage of eradication at TOC in the ME population was 63.8% in the 
tigecycline group vs. 70.0% in the ceftriaxone/metronidazole group (95% CI for the unadjusted 
difference:-13.9, 8.1.).  
In regards to the microbiologic responses at subject level, there were differences in the proportion of 
patients with monomicrobial and polimicrobial infection in each study, i.e in the m-mITT population, for 
study 315, around 54% of infections were polymicrobial, while in study 400 around 80% of infections 
were polymicrobial. Overall the percentage of patients with mono and polymicrobial infections that 
eradicated them in study 315 was higher than in study 400 in the tigecycline group (m-mITT 
population). This difference is in particular greater for monomicrobial infections, where the clinical 
success in the m-mITT population for each study were 84.1% in study 315 and 56.3% in study 400. In 
CHMP renewal assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/183367/2011  
Page 9/28
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
polymicrobial infections the responses rates for tigecycline in study 315 and 400 were 72.3% and 
63.4% respectively. Responses rates for ceftriaxone/metronidazole were comparable between both 
studies. Of note, the percentage of superinfection was slightly higher in the tigecycline group than in 
comparator.  
In summary in terms of clinical response, non-inferiority of tigecycline vs. comparator was shown for 
the two studies. Results on microbiological response are consistent with the main analysis. However 
the comparison results of these 2 studies raises some uncertainties. Response rates (in terms of both 
clinical and microbiological response rates) in study 400 were lower than those obtained in study 315. 
No comparison between results was conducted and no analysis for clinical failures was performed by 
the MAH. Therefore neither predictors for failure or explanation for the worst response obtained in 
study 400 have been identified. 
900-WW: Phase 4 study in Complicated Skin and Skin-Structure Infections 
Study 900 was a phase 3b/4 global, multicenter, randomized, open-label, comparative study, with the 
primary objective to compare the safety and efficacy of tigecycline with that of ampicillin-sulbactam or 
amoxicillin-clavulanate in treating patients with cSSSI. The primary endpoint was the clinical response 
in the CE population at the TOC visit, which was conducted 10 to 28 days after administration of the 
last dose of study drug. The secondary objectives of the study were to compare the microbiologic 
efficacy and to evaluate in vitro susceptibility data of tigecycline for a range of pathogenic bacteria 
related to cSSSI. 
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either tigecycline administered IV every 12 
hours (an initial dose of 100 mg followed by 50 mg every 12 hours), or ampicillin-sulbactam 1.5 g to 3 
g IV every 6 hours or amoxicillin-clavulanate 1.2 g IV every 6 to 8 hours was administered. Either 
vancomycin 1 g IV every 12 hours or teicoplanin IV at a loading dose of 400 mg the first day followed 
by a maintenance dose of 200 mg daily could be added if infection with MRSA was suspected or 
confirmed within the first 72 hours of enrolment. Treatment was administered for a minimum of 4 days 
to a maximum of 14 days.  
In the analysis of clinical response, tigecycline met the statistical criterion of non-inferiority, based on a 
non-inferiority margin of 15%, to comparator therapy in the CE population at the TOC assessment. For 
the CE population, the lower bound of the CI was -8.7% at the TOC assessment and the adjusted 
upper bound was 8.6%. A total of 162 of 209 (77.5%) tigecycline-treated patients and 152 of 196 
(77.6%) comparator-treated patients were clinically cured (difference 0.0; 95% CI, -8.7, 8.6).  
The overall mean effect on the primary endpoint is consistent with the previous two trials in cSSSI. 
Cure rates between tigecycline and comparator were similar and non inferiority was demonstrated.  
2.5.2.  Clinical safety 
The most relevant clinical safety data reviewed during the renewal is an analysis of mortality data from 
clinical trials conducted with tigecycline since August 2001, where a higher mortality was observed in 
Tygacil versus comparator-treated patients. The trials included in this analysis were conducted within a 
10-year interval, beyond the reporting period of safety data available since Tygacil MA in 2006. 
Therefore, and considering the relevance of this analysis for the risk/benefit conclusions, it is discussed 
in a separate section below. 
2.5.2.1.  Analysis of mortality data from Phase 3 and 4 clinical trials  
The MAH refers in the renewal application to an analysis of mortality data of Phase 3 and 4 trials which 
showed an increase in mortality in patients in tigecycline versus comparator arms. A detailed

discussion of these results had been submitted by the MAH in February 2010 as FU2 29.1 and was 
under review at the time of the renewal application. Given their relevance for the benefit/risk 
reassessment of the product, additional information on these analyses was requested to the MAH and 
the evaluation of these data was completed within the renewal. All data provided by the MAH on the 
above mortality analysis are discussed below.  
Since August 2001, 14 phase 3 and 4 studies of tigecycline have been conducted in approved and non-
approved indications (see below).  
The analyses of mortality, including mortality by infection type and overall pooled risk difference, were 
performed on the 13 studies which had a comparator (thus study 309 was excluded) and wers 
conducted over a period of time, with differences in the availability of patient level data and time 
points.  Results showed a statistically significant 1% overall risk difference in all-cause mortality 
between Tygacil and comparator arms. 
The analyses considered several patient factors at baseline, but not all variables were available from 
every study. Factors included age (<65, ≥65 years); sex; race; BMI (<28, ≥28); APACHE II score 
(≤15, >15, where available); infection type; geographic region (Europe, non-Europe); presence or 
absence of Acinetobacter spp; P. aeruginosa; history of COPD, CHF, and diabetes mellitus; prior 
antibiotic failure; albumin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), total protein, creatinine, potassium, and hemoglobin levels; white blood cell

count; and platelet count. In addition, analyses were performed based on “attributable cases” in a 
subgroup of cases identified by blinded internal reviewers. 
The numbers of patients with an adverse event with an outcome of death are summarized by infection 
type for all 14 studies in the table below. An excess in mortality for the tigecycline-treated patients 
was observed in 12 of the 13 studies which had a comparator. There were no statistically significant 
differences observed between treatment groups by infection type.  
The 13 phase 3 and phase 4 studies that included a comparator (study 309 was excluded) were pooled 
in order to estimate the risk difference for AEs with an outcome of death. The absolute risk difference 
for all-cause mortality was 1.0% (95% CI 0.2, 1.8) between tigecycline- and comparator-treated 
patients, with 3.9% (147/3788) of patients receiving tigecycline and 2.9% (105/3646) of patients 
receiving comparator drugs having AEs with an outcome of death.  
The analyses did not identify any cause for the increase in all-cause mortality noted in the tigecycline 
studies. The MAH concluded that deaths were the result of worsening or complications of infection or 
underlying co-morbidities. 
Whilst the magnitude of the risk difference varied across the different infection types, a difference was 
observed for most of the randomized studies between tigecycline and comparator. In the analysis

presented by the MAH, the hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and resistant pathogens (RP) 
indications represented the higher mortality risk: 1.9% (95% CI: -2.6, 6.4) and 3.9% (95% CI: -9.1, 
11.6), respectively. A greater risk difference was observed in patients with ventilator-associated 
pneumonia, a subgroup of HAP patients. In the case of EU authorized indications, mortality risks were: 
0.7% (95% CI: -0.5, 1.9) for complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSSI) and 1.0% (95% CI: -
0.3, 2.2) for complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI), similar to the overall risk obtained from the 
overall pooled analysis. Nevertheless, when relative risk measures were calculated (see below), 
mortality risks of tigecycline in these authorized indications (RRcSSSI = 1.9; RRcIAI =1.5) were similar or 
higher than those reported in RP (RRRP=1.8) or HAP (RRHAP=1.2). Relative risks are shown in the table 
below; note that these data were not provided by the MAH.

*Random effects model 
Furthermore, when only clinical trial data on tigecycline EU authorized indications were considered, the 
pooled-relative risk was 1.60 (95% CI: 1.02, 2.42) and pooled-risk difference was 1.0% (95% CI: 
0.01, 0.2). No heterogeneity was identified during the evaluation (Q statistic= 0,24; p-value=0,631); 
(data not provided by the MAH). 
A sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate heterogeneity among studies and infection types. It 
is noted that the usual way of assessing heterogeneity in meta-analysis is by means of statistical tests 
such as Cochran's Q and I2 index. However no data were provided by the MAH in this regard. Instead 
the MAH used a “sensitivity analysis” approach, where the impact of removing each of the studies was 
evaluated on the combined results, and which may also provide valid information. The analysis showed 
that the overall mortality increase was not driven by a particular study. The results of the sensitivity 
analyses performed by the MAH support the robustness of the mortality risk difference. 
The analysis by pathogen showed that in both treatment groups, the increase in mortality (percentage 
of patients) was associated with isolates of A. calcoaceticus/baumannii, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, 
P.aeruginosa, and MRSA. Of the patients who died, a higher percent in the tigecycline arm had K. 
pneumoniae isolates (16.7% versus 10.3%, tigecycline and comparator, respectively). 
Other analyses were performed to determine whether the increase in mortality was related to severity 
of underlying disease as assessed by APACHE II score. APACHE score was available for the cIAI, HAP, 
CHMP renewal assessment report

and RP studies. While the frequency of patients who had AEs with an outcome of death was higher in 
patients with the higher APACHE scores in each treatment arm, as would be expected, there were no 
statistically significant differences between the 2 treatment arms for patients with APACHE II scores 
>15. For patients with APACHE scores 15, the differences between treatment groups were statistically 
significant, consistent with the overall results. 
Analyses on AE focused on the initial 10 phase 3 trials, since data from the DFI study (319) and the 3 
post-marketing studies (315, 400 and 900) were not available at the time these analyses were 
performed. The most common AEs with an outcome of death were for tigecycline-treated and 
comparator-treated patients, respectively: shock (0.8% versus 0.2%), septic shock (0.7% versus 
0.3%), pneumonia (0.6% versus 0.2%), heart arrest (0.6% versus 0.2%), and respiratory failure 
(0.6% versus 0.7%). The differences for shock, heart arrest, and pneumonia were statistically 
significant. 
The table below shows the increase observed in tigecycline-treated patients for events of heart arrest 
and shock (including septic shock) with an outcome of death. 
Since some of the clinical findings could be indication-related, additional safety data from relevant 
studies in the approved indications was requested by the CHMP.  
For cSSSI the MAH submitted a table of serious adverse events (SAEs) from pooled data from the 
pivotal phase 3 studies (300, 305) and the phase 4 study (900). The incidence of SAEs (overall) was 
similar between tigecycline and the comparators. However for the 3 studies, an increase was observed 
for the events of heart arrest and shock including septic shock (10 SAE for tigecycline and 2 for 
comparators (see table below), and for infections (11 for tigecycline and 4 in comparator).   
CHMP renewal assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/183367/2011  
Page 14/28
 
 
 
 
 
A higher number of deaths due to septic shock, shock and heart arrest in tigecycline-treated patients 
was also observed in the Phase 4 study 900; this is in line with the above mentioned higher mortality 
trend observed in the overall analysis in cSSTI patients.   
For cIAI, the data provided (presented as pooled data from studies 301, 306, 315, 316 and 400), 
showed that SAEs with outcome of deaths were numerically higher in tigecycline than in comparator 
(40 and 27 respectively), with an excess risk of around 50%. The number of patients with sepsis, 
septic shock, shock and heart arrest was 24 in the tigecycline treated patients (which had any of these 
SAE with an outcome of death) compared with 10 in the comparator treated patients. Any of these 
events was considered as drug-related. Narratives of deaths submitted by the MAH concluded that they 
could be explained by the evolution of the disease. However it can be argued that even if they were 
related to the evolution of the disease, this could imply a lack of efficacy in these patients.  
In January 2010, the CHMP agreed that a number of outstanding issues needed to be addressed by the 
MAH, including a discussion on the possible causes of these findings and key factors which might 
identify patients at risk of not responding to Tygacil. In response to this request, the MAH provided a 
combined analysis of the phase 3 and 4 trials by indication (i.e., cSSSI and cIAI) aimed to identify risk 
factors associated with treatment failure. These analyses comprised mainly: 1) stepwise logistic 
regression models and 2) non-parametric modelling by means “classification and regression trees 
(CARTs)”. The MAH could not indentify risk factors associated with failure that differentiated tigecycline 
patients from patients in the comparator group. 
CHMP renewal assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/183367/2011  
Page 15/28
 
 
 
 
 
In cIAI, pneumonia was identified by the MAH as a confounding factor which could have influenced the 
increased number of specific adverse events occurred in tigecycline-treated patients. 2.1% of 
tigecycline-treated patients and 1.2% of comparator-treated patients developed a TEAE of pneumonia. 
Tigecycline-treated patients who developed pneumonia had a higher incidence of serious events, 
discontinuation, and death. According to the definition of superinfection applied in clinical trials by the 
MAH, emergence of a new isolate associated with a clinical event during therapy at a site other than 
the initial site of infection was considered to be an adverse event. However new isolates emerging at a 
site other than the initial site of infection (i.e pneumonia) can also be considered as superinfection and 
therefore cases of pneumonia observed could be interpreted as superinfection. Development of 
superinfection may therefore have been a relevant contributing factor to the higher risk observed in 
these patients. 
In the CHMP view the analyses provided by the MAH do not exclude a treatment effect. They were 
performed retrospectively and had relevant methodological and statistical limitations, i.e. 
comprehensive information on the methodology applied was not presented. Furthermore, as explained 
above, the trend to higher mortality in tigecycline-treated patients has been consistently observed 
across studies and type of infections. Whilst the causes of these results have not been identified, this 
trend cannot be explained by a repeatedly inefficient randomisation leading to an uneven distribution 
of key prognostic factors between treatment arms in favour of the comparator during the entire clinical 
development.  
In order to further explore a possible explanation to these findings a meeting was held on February 8th 
2010 with the Anti-Infectives Scientific Advisory Group (SAG-AI). The experts were asked to address 
the questions on whether the higher mortality risk in tygecycline-treated patients might be due to 
insufficient efficacy (dosing, antimicrobial spectrum) in particular clinical situations or to safety issues, 
and to further discuss whether key factors determining insufficient response in cSSTI and cIAI could be 
identified.  
The experts acknowledged the small but consistent trend towards an increase in mortality observed 
throughout the different trials of tigecycline development programme, and concluded that there was 
insufficient data to reach conclusions on the main determinants of these findings. They agreed that in 
relation to the licensed indications, this phenomenon appears to be associated with differing causes of 
death such as late, non-infectious complications, or occurrence of pneumonia. They also advised that 
the product information be strengthened to ensure adequate use and minimise the risks in severely ill 
patients; this should include appropriate warnings on superinfections. 
2.5.2.2.  Cumulative experience from 15 Jun 2005 through 15 Aug 2010 
The MAH has included in the discussion for this section a first PSUR covering the period 15 June 2005 
to 14 December 2005, which was not submitted in the EU since Tygacil was not yet authorised. The 
first PSUR submitted in the EU covered the period 15 December 2005 to 14 June 2006. The cumulative 
number of patient exposed to tigecycline since 15 December 2005 through 15 Aug 2010 is estimated 
to be 944,831 patients. 
Since the MA, 5 6-monthly PSURs and two annual PSURs have been submitted. A bridging summary 
review covering the period from 15 June 2005 to 15 August 2010, which includes information from the 
PSURs previously submitted, has been included in the renewal application. 
In the tigecycline PSURs, the following topics were presented (those topics that are included in the risk 
management plan and therefore subject to a close monitoring are designated with an asterisk (*)): 
nausea and vomiting, diarrhea including Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea and 
pseudomembranous colitis*; hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis*; prolonged PT and 
CHMP renewal assessment report

aPTT; renal disorders, including increased BUN; hepatic disorders* including hyperbilirubinemia/severe 
jaundice, aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) abnormalities; 
pancreatitis*; hypoproteinemia; cardiovascular events, including QTc prolongation/torsade de 
pointes*; thrombocytopenia*; hearing loss; drug interactions: seizure; skin hyperpigmentation; 
dermatologic reactions. Relevant events are discussed below: 
Pancreatitis 
In the most recent PSUR, a cumulative review of reports of tigecycline-associated pancreatitis was 
presented. Out of the 108 reports reviewed 105 cases were considered serious. The review did not 
provide relevant new information. As reflected in the risk management plan (RMP), the MAH has been 
requested to use a specific questionnaire for the reported cases. 
Hepatobiliary disorders  
In the most recent PSUR, and with data lock point June 2009, and following a CHMP request, the MAH 
provided a cumulative review of tigecycline-associated hepatic failure and severe hepatic injury hepatic 
cases. A total of 24 cases of hepatic failure/encephalopathy/hepatorenal syndrome were reported. 
Outcome was provided in 21 cases; of them, 19 had a fatal outcome (90%). In seven cases hepatic 
failure occurred in the setting of multiorgan failure and sepsis. The evaluation of these cases did not 
allow drawing definitive conclusions.  
Hypersensitivity Reactions  
A total of 7 reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) have been received cumulatively. As 
requested by the CHMP following the assessment of the last PSUR, the MAH is including SJS to the list 
of adverse reactions in the SmPC. 
Fatal cases  
Cases in which the death is caused or related to a progression and/or complication of the infectious 
disease treated with tigecycline represented about 50% of fatal reported cases where causality could 
be assessed. 
Lack of efficacy  
Efficacy related case reports have been reported and analysed in all PSURs presented to date; the MAH 
has identified 18, 40, and 19 reports of tigecycline lack of efficacy in PSUR-7, PSUR-6 and PSUR 5, 
respectively. This represents 10-15% of all individual safety case reports received during these 
periods. The sources of some cases are reports published in the medical literature: 
  Anthony k et al. “Clinical and microbiological outcomes of serious infections with multidrug-
resistant gram-negative organisms treated with tigecycline. Clin Infect Dis 2008; 46:567–70”. 
According to the authors, the experience of 18 patients who received tigecycline as treatment 
for infection due to multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli, observed evolution of resistance 
during therapy, which raises concerns on the routine use of tigecycline in treatment of such 
infections when other therapies are available.  
  García- Cabrera et al. “Superinfection during treatment of nosocomial infections with 
tigecycline. Eur J Clin. Microbiol Infect Dis (2010)29:867-871” have evaluated the occurrence 
of superinfection (defined as the isolation of bacterial strains different to those causing the 
primary infection) during tigecycline treatment. In this study the superinfection rate during 
tigecycline treatment was 23.5% being P. aeruginosa the most frequent pathogen, responsible 
for 58.3% of superinfections. Considering the potential risk of infection with P.aeruginosa and 
other resistant bacteria, the authors have suggested a tight surveillance in the follow up of 
patients treated with tigecycline.

Off label use 
In the last PSUR (15 June 2009 to 14 June 2010) the MAH presented the results of a European 
utilization study. Following a CHMP request to provide a more detailed evaluation of the results, 
including an analysis of numbers and characteristics of patients treated for off-label indications and a 
discussion of factors modifying the level of this off-label use, additional information was submitted on 
February 2011. Based on this study, 23,714 patients hospitalized in 2008 were treated with 
tigecycline. The proportions of on-label and off-label users were 38.7% and 61.4% respectively. This 
drug utilization study also provided information on distribution of pathogens stratified by indication. In 
regards to pathogens isolated from patients treated for the EU approved indications in 2007-2008, 938 
isolates were obtained from intra-abdominal infection/pelvic abscess patients (IAI) and 6391 from 
skin/skin structure infections (SSSI) patients. Pseudomona aeruginosa (inherently resistant organism) 
was found in 64 (6,8%) of IAI and 82 (1,3%) of SSSI isolates, and other organisms for which acquired 
resistance may be a problem (Acinetobacter sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella neumoniae) were 
found in 291 (31%) of IAI and 1548 (24%) SSSI isolates. In view of these data, the MAH has been 
requested to update the RMP in regards to off-label use. 
Following assessment of the last PSUR the MAH has been requested to provide the following 
information: 
 
a specific questionnaire aimed to gather relevant information from reports of cases of 
suspected hepatic failure associated to tigecycline treatment.  
 
a cumulative analysis of reports Stevens-Johnson syndrome, extended also to other severe 
cutaneous adverse reactions, as toxic epidermal necrolysis. 
  A detailed discussion of specific aspects of the results of the European Tygacil drug utilization 
study submitted with the last PSUR. 
The MAH submitted this information in February 2011 and it is currently under assessment.  In parallel 
a variation to include the term Stevens-Johnson syndrome in section 4.8 of the SmPC has been 
submitted. 
Changes in the Product Information 
Relevant changes made in the SmPC since the MA as a result of new safety data reviewed in the PSURs 
are listed below: 
 
Pancreatitis was included in section 4.4 and removed from the tetracycline-class effect. 
  Anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid  reactions  were  included  in  section  4.4  and  4.8.  Thrombocytopenia 
was also included in section 4.8. 
 
Jaundice and liver injury were added as adverse reactions in Section 4.8.  
  Section  4.4  and  4.8  were  updated  to  include  reference  to  cases  of  significant  hepatic 
dysfunction and hepatic failure.  
 
Following submission of the 6th PSUR (June 2008-June 2009), the CHMP requested the MAH a 
review of safety data in severely ill patients and from new phase 4 studies. In april 2010 
section 4.8 of the SmPC was amended to update the mortality data from cSSSI and cIAI 
studies, which was based on 1415 patients; the revised figures were  based on an 
updated study database (including a recently completed phase 3 study in DFI and 3 phase 4 
studies) and 2514 patients.  
CHMP renewal assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/183367/2011  
Page 18/28
 
 
 
 
In addition, and following submission of the results of a study in diabetic foot infections, the SmPC was 
updated to add in section 4.1 that Tygacil is not indicated for diabetic foot infections; section 4.4 was 
updated with information from this study. 
Pharmacovigilance system 
Following the acquisition of Wyeth by Pfizer, which was completed on 16 October 2009, the Wyeth 
pharmacovigilance system (PhVS) was decommissioned and a new Pfizer pharmacovigilance system 
was implemented effective from 8 November 2010. The introduction of the new PhVS is not expected 
to have any impact on Tygacil benefit/risk balance. In this respect the MAH has recently submitted in 
February 2011 an application for a worksharing procedure (WS/0117) for the introduction of a new 
PhVS (update to the DDPS) for Tygacil and which also applies to other Centrally Authorised Products 
from the same MAH. This new system and DDPS have been assessed and agreed during the recent 
review of a MAA, from the same MAH, which received a positive CHMP opinion on 16 January 2011.  
2.5.2.3.  Report of post marketing experience 15 June 2010 to 15 August 2010. 
Overall safety evaluation  
In addition, the MAH submitted within the renewal dossier an addendum of the most recently 
submitted PSUR (15 June 2009 to 14 June 2010). This addendum report covers the period from 15 
June 2010 to 15 August 2010. During this reporting period a total of 54 medically confirmed case 
reports from spontaneous (n=40) and study (n=14) notifications were received. Of these 54 reports, 
41 contained at least 1 SAE, and 13 were non-serious. Of the 41 SAE reports, 27 were received from 
spontaneous notifications and 14 were received from the study environment, including 12 reports 
which originated from a single published case series by Garcia-Cabrera et al. 
Fatal case reports  
During this reporting period, 9 reports with fatal outcome (4 spontaneous and 5 from study 
environment) were received. Of the 5 reports originated from an observational study of 51 patients, 3 
died due to superinfections and 2 due to underlying diseases. Cases in which the death is caused or 
related to a progression or complication of the infectious disease treated with tigecycline represented 
about 50% of fatal reported cases. As in the previous PSUR in a relevant percentage of the cases only 
limited information was provided by the MAH in relation the cause of death.  
Hepatobiliary Disorders 
During this reporting period, 6 reports of hepatobiliary disorder were received (5 serious, 1 non-
serious). Hepatic failure is expected to be a relevant feature in cases where lack efficacy of the 
treatments leads to sepsis and multi-organic failure.  
Nausea and Vomiting 
During this reporting period, 6 reports (5 non-serious, 1 serious) of nausea and vomiting were received 
Nausea and vomiting are already include as ADR in the EU-SmPC. During the last PSURs, the increase 
in the number of cases has been considered a possible concern. Serious events of nausea and vomiting 
should continue to be monitored trough the PSUR. 
Pancreatitis 
During this reporting period, 7 reports of pancreatitis were received, all of them serious and 70% were 
recovered following tigecycline withdrawal. Pancreatitis should continue to be monitored through PSUR 
and RMP. 
CHMP renewal assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/183367/2011  
Page 19/28
 
 
 
 
 
Hypersensitivity Reactions 
During this reporting period, 1 report of hypersensitivity reaction was received. In addition 1 new case 
of Guillain Barré syndrome has been reported. To date, none reports of Guillain Barré syndrome had 
been identified. This is a very rare and severe syndrome, which had not been reported previously. The 
MAH should continue to monitor these events, including Stevens-Johnson and Guillain Barré syndrome, 
through the PSURs and RMP.  
Lack of efficacy 
During this reporting period, 3 reports of lack of tigecycline effect were received. In addition while not 
meeting the criteria for lack of efficacy, 12 reports describing superinfection in patients who received 
tigecycline for multidrug-resistant nosocomial infections originated from a single published 
retrospective case series by Garcia-Cabrera et al. above mentioned. 
As already mentioned lack of efficacy is a serious concern with Tygacil. In this respect the information 
in the PSUR addendum report is consistent with previous PSURs. As already mentioned new isolates 
emerging at a site other than the initial site of infection (i.e cases of pneumonia associated with an 
outcome of death) during antibacterial treatment should be considered as superinfection. This is in line 
with the above mentioned published report. Therefore the current general statement in section 4.4 of 
the SmPC on the rate of superinfection should be strengthened. In addition “development of 
superinfection” should be included in the RMP as an identified risk to be closely monitored in clinical 
practice. 
Off-label Use 
More than 30% of the reports received during the reporting period describe off-label use. Moreover, 
44% and 50% of the reports in off- label and on-label use describe lack of tigecycline effect 
respectively. As discussed in the next section, the MAH will update the RMP in regards to off-label use, 
and implement risk minimisation measures. 
Other adverse reactions and risks which should be monitored through PSUR/RMP are Skin 
hyperpigmentation, renal disorders, thrombocytopenia, potential for drug interactions, drug overdose 
and prescription/medication errors. 
2.5.2.4.  EU Risk Management Plan 
The current version of the EU Risk Management Plan (vs 6) was submitted by the MAH in August 2010 
As requested in the previous PSUR, severe hepatic reactions was re-classified as an important 
identified risk. Identified risks included in the plan are Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea and 
pseudomembranous colitis, hyperbilirubinemia/jaundice, aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) abnormalities, severe hepatic reactions, hipersensitivity reactions including 
anaphylaxis, pancreatitis and thrombocytopenia. These terms are included in the SmPC. Based on 
reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), it is being included in section 4.8 of the SmPC (see above 
section). A potential risk included in the plan is QTc prolongation/torsade de pointes. 
In the current Risk Management Plan (vs 6), the potential off-label use is discussed and is included in 
the Safety Specification section. The MAH is requested to update the “Potential for Off-Label Use” 
section considering the results of the European utilization study which show that at least 60% of the 
patients in a relevant sample in Europe hospitals are treated for non approved indications.  
The higher rates of certain serious adverse events (SAE) and of fatal outcomes consistently observed 
across Tygacil studies and the risks identified during the evaluation of all available data, including 
postmarketing experience, warrant the implementation of specific measures in Tygacil risk

management plan. Currently there are no risk minimisation measures in the RMP. The CHMP concluded 
that the following measures were required to be implemented by the MAH:  
  Distribution of a DHCPL addressed to Tygacil prescribers to inform of the mortality findings, 
and the changes in the product information strengthening that Tygacil should only be used in 
the approved indications when other suitable alternatives are not available. It will also advise 
on the need of a close monitoring of patients and switch to alternative antibacterial therapy if 
superinfection occurs. 
 
Implementation of an Educational Program addressed to the HCP which will include scientific 
information on the SmPC changes. The program will focus on the need to further characterize 
superinfections (both new isolates emerged during therapy at the initial site of infection and a 
site other than the initial) and lack of efficacy. It will also warn about the off-label use risks.  
  Set-up of a prospective Post Authorisation safety Study (PASS) to monitor emergence of 
superinfections and treatment failures, as relevant risks identified in the RMP. The study will be 
conducted in a selected number of representative centres of the EU clinical setting and will also 
provide microbiology data. Information on Tygacil prescription patterns will also be obtained. 
The CHMP has recommended that the above measures be a condition of the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation (see Annex II). The full revised RMP will be submitted by the MAH after the Commission 
Decision. 
2.5.2.5.  Conclusion on Safety  
As explained above higher mortality rates have been observed in clinical trials among Tygacil versus 
comparator-treated patients. These findings, though more pronounced in particular clinical situations, 
are consistent across the development program, and are also seen in recent post marketing trials 
conducted in the approved indications. Although the causes of the higher mortality risk have not been 
identified, a lower than expected efficacy of Tygacil cannot be ruled out. Several factors may have 
contributed to the fatal outcomes, i.e. poor baseline conditions and presence of co-morbidities; 
emergence of superinfections during treatment is likely to have influenced the overall findings.  
The safety of tigecycline has been followed through PSURs and a RMP, which also discuss as relevant 
issues reports of death and lack of efficacy as well as off-label use. Other findings observed in the 
clinical trials are also described in these post-marketing reports i.e. development of superinfection. 
Currently lack of efficacy is monitored in all Tygacil clinical trials with particular focus on severely ill 
patients with cIAI and cSSSI (FUM 19). In addition the results of the Tygacil European Surveillance 
Trial (TEST) study aiming to monitor the emergence of resistance in the EU are provided regularly 
(FUM 17). The MAH will continue to submit reports on both topics on a yearly basis.  
The MAH also committed in the Letter of Undertaking from February 2002 to provide the results of a 
pharmacokinetic study (307A1-120-US) of tigecycline in patients with biliary cirrhosis. The CSR 
submission has been postponed as is now due for the end of March 2011. 
The CHMP has recommended that measures aimed to secure a safe use of Tygacil and minimise the 
risk of fatal outcome in susceptible or severely ill patients be implemented by the MAH. These 
measures include: 
  SmPC amendment to indicate that Tygacil should only be used in the approved indications 
when there are no suitable therapeutic alternatives, and to warn about the mortality findings, 
the need to closely monitor patients and institute alternative antibacterial therapy if 
superinfection occurs. 
CHMP renewal assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/183367/2011  
Page 21/28
 
 
 
 
 
Implementation of a risk minimisation plan aimed to address the risks of superinfections, lack 
of efficacy, and off label use and a post-authorisation safety study which will provide relevant 
data and monitor these risks.  
The MAH submitted 5 6-monthly PSURs, 2 annual PSURs plus a 2-month PSUR addendum. The CHMP 
has recommended that PSUR should continue to be submitted annually. The next PSUR submission is 
due by August 2011. 
The risk minimisation plan and the post-authorisation safety study have been recommended to be a 
condition of the renewal of the marketing authorisation. 
Based on the above conclusions, the CHMP has recommended that the MAH submits one additional 
renewal application. 
2.6.  Product information 
2.6.1.  Summary of product characteristics, labelling and package leaflet 
Taking into consideration the higher mortality observed in clinical trials in tigecycline-treated patients, 
the CHMP considers that Tygacil SmPC needs to be amended to warn HCP of these findings and to 
make recommendations aimed to minimise the occurrence of fatal outcomes in particular in the most 
susceptible and severely ill patients. Therefore the CHMP has requested further amendments to the 
product information during the procedure.  
The higher mortality risk in Tygacil-treated patients is acknowledged. Considering all available data a 
lower efficacy of tigecycline over comparator treatments in patients treated for the authorised 
indications cannot be excluded. Therefore the CHMP has recommended that a new statement be added 
to the indication section to restrict Tygacil use in the approved indications cSSSI and cIAI to those 
situations where other suitable alternatives are not available, aiming to be used only when it is really 
needed.  
The CHMP has also recommended the inclusion of new warnings to inform prescribers of the higher 
mortality observed in Tygacil trials; in addition the potential role of a lower efficacy of tygecicline in 
these findings, needs to be specifically stated. As discussed above the development of superinfections, 
in particular pneumonia, seems to have a relevant influence in the outcome; therefore and in line with 
the advise provided by the SAG experts, a warning has been added to section 4.4, to recommend 
closely monitoring of patients, specifically the potential development of infections in focus other than 
the initial cIAI and cSSSI, and to institute alternative antibacterial treatments if this occurs. 
The inclusion of additional warning aiming to address the off-label use has also been warranted. As the 
drug utilisation study and PSUR data provided by the MAH demonstrate, Tygacil is widely prescribed in 
non approved indications. Therefore an additional statement has been added to section 4.4 to 
strengthen that Tygacil should not be used in other indications that those in which it is specifically 
authorised, namely cSSSI and cIAI. 
Taking the above into account, the CHMP has recommended that the following information be included 
in sections 4.1 and 4.4 of the SmPC (new text in italics). 
4.1 Therapeutic indications 
Tygacil is indicated in adults for the treatment of the following infections (see sections 4.4 and 5.1): 
  Complicated skin and soft tissue infections, excluding diabetic foot infections (see section 4.4) 
  Complicated intra-abdominal infections 
CHMP renewal assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/183367/2011  
Page 22/28
 
 
 
 
Tygacil should be used only in situations where it is known or suspected that other alternatives are not 
suitable (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
……….. 
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use 
In clinical studies in complicated skin and soft tissue infections, complicated intra-abdominal infections, 
diabetic foot infections, nosocomial pneumonia and studies in resistant pathogens, a numerically 
higher mortality rate among Tygacil treated patients has been observed as compared to the 
comparator treatment. The causes of these findings remain unknown, but poorer efficacy and safety 
than the study comparators cannot be ruled out. 
Patients who develop super-infections, in particular nosocomial pneumonia, appear to be associated 
with poorer outcomes. Patients should be closely monitored for the development of super-infection. If 
a focus of infection other than cSSTI or cIAI is identified after initiation of Tygacil therapy consideration 
should be given to instituting alternative antibacterial therapy that has been demonstrated to be 
efficacious in the treatment of the specific type of infection(s) present. 
Tygacil is not approved for clinical indications other than complicated skin and soft tissue infections, 
and complicated intra-abdominal infections. The use of Tygacil in non-approved indications is not 
recommended. 
….. 
The MAH proposed changes to the Product Information (PI) at the time of the renewal application to 
bring it in line with the current version of the QRD template (v7.3). According to this, and in line with 
the SmPC guideline, information on fertility has been included in sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC. 
Other minor amendments have been made as per the above guidance. These changes were reviewed 
by QRD and accepted by the CHMP. 
2.6.2.  General conditions for the marketing authorisation

2.8.  Conclusions on benefit risk balance of the product 
At the time of the initial MAA a number of issues were identified by the CHMP, among them, the 
questionable representativeness of the population enrolled in the pivotal studies (in terms of both, 
severity of infections and co-morbid conditions) and a numerically increased mortality among Tygacil 
treated patients. Based on all efficacy and safety data submitted, a positive benefit risk conclusion was 
agreed at the end of the procedure, together with relevant amendments in the product information 
which highlighted the limitations of the clinical studies and a number of post-marketing commitments 
aimed to address the concerns identified. The available data was insufficient to recommend additional 
warnings or restrictions. 
A number of post-marketing studies in approved (cSSSI and cIAI) and non-approved indications (HAP, 
DFI and resistant pathogens) have reproduced the higher mortality trend observed with Tygacil, thus 
confirming the initial findings. As expected, differences are small, but consistently present. This 
prompted the submission by the MAH of a review of the mortality analyses prior to the renewal 
application. Given the relevance of these safety findings for the product benefit/risk reassessment, and 
following preliminary discussions held by the CHMP in December 2010, the evaluation of these data 
was completed within the renewal procedure.  
As stated above, clinical trials in all indications have shown a small but consistent trend towards a 
higher risk of death among patients treated with Tygacil than that observed in comparator-treated 
patients. In many circumstances, and this is not an exception, it is difficult to determine whether the 
main factor contributing to an increase in mortality is that the product lacks the expected efficacy or it 
is linked to a toxicity issue. In the case of Tygacil no definitive answer can be given with certainty. 
However, the fact that deaths are frequently associated to clinical events like shock, sepsis and heart 
CHMP renewal assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/183367/2011  
Page 25/28
 
 
 
 
 
arrest, seems to indicate that an inadequate response to the product may be behind a relevant number 
of cases with fatal outcome.  
In an attempt to identify risk factors associated to the fatal outcomes, the MAH has provided a number 
of analyses that are acknowledged though are of questionable validity to truly establish their real 
causes. There is not probably a single contributing factor. Aspects such as advanced age, severity of 
the disease, clinical status of the patient, co-morbid conditions, altered immunocompetence, etc, not 
strictly related to the treatment, are likely to play a relevant role. However, when within a series of 
randomised clinical trials in different indications, conducted in different geographical areas and at 
different points in time, the same finding is consistently observed, it has to be inferred that treatment 
is to some extent responsible for it. In the CHMP view, and taking into account all available 
information, this possibility cannot be excluded and needs to be seriously considered. 
It is difficult to determine the factors associated with Tygacil therapeutic failures; it is likely that a 
combination of factors, rather than a single one, is responsible for them. The selection of certain 
pathogens, superinfections with non-susceptible pathogens, relative underdosing in very obese and 
morbidly obese patients, may be contributing (isolated or jointly) to treatment failure and, ultimately, 
patients death. Unfortunately, in the CHMP view, new analyses of existing data will be of limited help 
to provide further insight into this issue, which can only be prospectively addressed in future studies 
and surveillance programs.    
Off label use is not a unique feature of Tygacil, but is a common practice with antibiotics in clinical 
situations where therapeutic decisions are guided by microbiological data and local pattern of 
resistance. However, the fact that more than half of the drug prescriptions of Tygacil are off label 
further complicates the approach to the problem. 
The increase of antimicrobial resistance is limiting the treatment options available. In this respect the 
CHMP acknowledges the need for antibiotics, particularly those directed against multiresistant Gram-
negative bacteria, such as tigecycline. In this respect Tygacil may certainly provide added value to 
patients in specific clinical situations. However given the higher mortality risk observed in patients 
treated with tigecycline, the CHMP has recommended that Tygacil use in the approved indications 
cSSSI and cIAI be restricted to those situations where other suitable alternatives are not available, 
aiming to limit its use to those cases where it is really needed.  
Based  upon  the  data  that  have  become  available  since  the  granting  of  the  initial  Marketing 
Authorisation,  the  CHMP  considers  that  the  benefit-risk  balance  of  Tygacil  remains  positive,  but 
considers that its safety and efficacy profile is to be closely monitored for the following reasons: 
 
In  an  analysis  of  clinical  studies  a  higher  mortality  rate  was  observed  in  Tygacil  versus 
comparator-treated patients. This trend has been consistently observed throughout the product 
clinical  program,  and  has  been  maintained  in  recent  post  marketing  trials  in  the  approved 
indications.  
 
The  causes  of  these  findings  have  not  been  identified  but  a  lower  than  expected  efficacy  of 
Tygacil cannot be ruled out.  
The  CHMP  has  recommended  that  measures  aimed  to  secure  a  safe  use  of  Tygacil  and  minimise  the 
risk  of  fatal  outcome  in  susceptible  or  severely  ill  patients  be  implemented  by  the  MAH.  These 
measures include: 
  SmPC amendment to indicate that Tygacil should only be used in the approved indications 
when there are no suitable therapeutic alternatives, and to warn about the mortality findings, 
the need to closely monitor patients and institute alternative antibacterial therapy if 
superinfection occurs. 
CHMP renewal assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/183367/2011  
Page 26/28
 
 
 
 
 
Implementation of a risk minimisation plan aimed to address the risks of superinfections, lack 
of efficacy, and off label use and a post-authorisation safety study which will provide relevant 
data and monitor these risks.  
In view of new data reviewed as part of the renewal application, the CHMP recommends amendments 
to the Annexes I, II and IIIB. These changes do not affect the benefit/risk balance of the product which 
remains positive. 
The CHMP is of the opinion that one additional five-year renewal on the basis of safety grounds is 
required. 
3.  Outcome of the renewal 
Based on the CHMP review of the available information and on the basis of a re-evaluation of the 
benefit risk balance, the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and efficacy of this medicinal 
product continues to be adequately and sufficiently demonstrated and therefore considered that the 
benefit risk profile of Tygacil continues to be favourable.  
The CHMP recommends the renewal of the Marketing Authorisation for Tygacil, subject to the 
conditions as laid down in Annex II to the Opinion as well as the outstanding commitments of the 
Marketing Authorisation Holder as laid down in his Letter of Undertaking (see Attachment 9) of this 
Assessment Report.  
The CHMP is however of the opinion that one additional five-year renewal on the basis of safety 
grounds is required. The grounds for one additional renewal are set out in the Annex IV to the opinion. 
The renewal requires amendments to the terms of the Community Marketing Authorisation. The 
following annexes have been amended: I, II and IIIB.  
4.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this renewal application. In particular the 
EPAR steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope: 
Renewal of the Marketing Authorisation 
Summary: 
In an analysis of clinical studies a higher mortality rate has been observed in Tygacil versus 
comparator-treated patients. The higher mortality trend has been consistently observed throughout 
the product clinical program, and has been maintained in recent post-marketing trials in the approved 
indications. The causes of these findings have not been identified but a lower than expected efficacy of 
Tygacil cannot be ruled out.  
The CHMP has recommended that measures aimed to secure a safe use of Tygacil and minimise the 
risk of fatal outcome in susceptible or severely ill patients be implemented by the MAH. These 
measures include:

  SmPC amendment to indicate that Tygacil should only be used in the approved indications 
when there are no suitable therapeutic alternatives, and to warn about the mortality findings, 
the need to closely monitor patients and institute alternative antibacterial therapy if 
superinfection occurs. 
 
Implementation of a risk minimisation plan to address the identified risks, in particular 
superinfections, treatment failures and off-label use, and a post-authorisation safety study 
expected to provide relevant data and monitor these risks.  
The CHMP is of the opinion that one additional five-year renewal on the basis of safety grounds is 
required.

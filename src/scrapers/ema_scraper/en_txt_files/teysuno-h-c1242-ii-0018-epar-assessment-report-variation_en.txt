Gastric  cancer  is  the  second  leading  cause  of  cancer  mortality  in  the  world  (Wagner,  2006).  The 
majority of cases are diagnosed at a late stage, moreover, in the majority of patients who undergoes 
surgery,  disease  eventually  recurs.  In  patients  with  recurrent  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  disease, 
the  only  available  treatment  option  consists  of  palliative  chemotherapy,  with  very  limited  effect 
reported in the literature to date in terms of prolongation of overall survival and symptoms palliation.  
Current  treatment  guidelines  in  the  European  Union  (EU)  and  United  States  for  metastatic  or  locally 
advanced  disease  recommend,  in  patients  with  HER2  negative  status,  two  drug  combinations  due  to 
increased  toxicity  associated  with  three  drug  regimens  (Waddell,  2013;  NCCN,  2013).  Recommended 
options  for  first-line  treatment  include  a  fluoropyrimidine  (5-fluorouracil  or  capecitabine)  and  a 
platinum  agent  (cisplatin  or  oxaliplatin)  with  an  anthracycline  (epirubicin),  topoisomerase  inhibitor 
(irinotecan),  or  taxane  (docetaxel)  added  as  the  third  agent  in  the  combination  for  medically  fit 
patients with relatively good performance status (NCCN, 2013; Waddell, 2013).  
In  recent  years,  substitution  of  cisplatin  with  oxaliplatin,  in  patients  with  a  contraindication  for 
cisplatin,  has  been  suggested  in  the  literature  on  the  basis  of  few  reported  studies  and  on  a  recent 
meta-analysis (Cunningham, 2008). However, Oxaliplatin is not currently registered for the treatment 
of  patients  with  gastric  carcinoma  in  EU.  Oxaliplatin  is  a  diaminocyclohexane-containing  platinum 
compound  with  cytotoxic  effects  in  a  broad  range  of  cancer  cell  types  and  in  vivo  tumour  models 
(Raymond,  2002;  Powles,  2007).  It  does  not  appear  to  be  cross-resistant  with  cisplatin  (Raymond, 
2002; Culy, 2000). Like cisplatin, oxaliplatin acts by creating DNA lesions that prevent DNA replication 
and  transcription.  Differences  in  the  number  and  type  of  DNA  lesions  caused  by  the  two  compounds 
and their effects on mRNA translation likely explain the reported differences in specificity and efficacy 
between  them  (Raymond,  2002;  Becker,  2014).  Oxaliplatin  is  approved  for  use  in  combination  with 
fluoropyrimidines  for  adjuvant  treatment  of  phase  III  colorectal  cancer  and  first-line  treatment  of 
metastatic colorectal cancer in the Europe, US, and Asia (NCI, 2014; Mani, 2000). 
Comparison  of  oxaliplatin  and  cisplatin  in  combination  with  fluoropyrimidines  in  advanced  gastric 
cancer 
Evidence from clinical trials supports the use of cisplatin plus 5-FU as standard first-line treatment for 
advanced HER 2 negative gastric cancer (Lordick, 2013; Montagnani, 2011). Substitution of 5-FU with 
oral fluoropyrimidines such as S-1 and capecitabine provides non-inferior efficacy. Several trials have 
been  conducted  to  test  the  efficacy  of  substituting  oxaliplatin  to  cisplatin  in  combination  with 
fluoropyrimidines: 
-A phase 2  European study that compared the combination of 5-FU and leucovorin plus oxaliplatin or 
cisplatin  in  72  patients  with  advanced  gastric  cancer  reported  fewer  grade  3/4  adverse  events  for 
patients who received oxaliplatin compared to patients who received cisplatin (p<0.05)(Popov, 2008). 
In  addition,  a  median  survival  of  10  months  for  patients  who  received  the  oxaliplatin-based  regimen 
versus 7 months for the cisplatin-based regimen was observed (p=0.003). 
-A  two-by-two  trial  design  was  used  in  the  phase  III  Randomized  ECF  for  Advanced  and  Locally 
Advanced Esophagogastric Cancer 2 (REAL-2) trial. A total of 1002 patients were randomized twice to 
receive  either  oxaliplatin  or  cisplatin  and  either  capecitabine  or  5-FU.  All  patients  also  received 
epirubicin. The four combinations were found to be equally effective (Cunningham, 2008). 
-Another  randomized,  controlled,  phase  3  trial  conducted  by  the  Arbeitsgemeinschaft  Internistische 
Onkologie  (AIO)  in  220  patients  with  advanced  gastric  cancer  compared  treatment  with  5-FU  and 
leucovorin plus either cisplatin or oxaliplatin (Al-Batran, 2008). In a post-hoc analysis, elderly patients 
(≥ 65 years, n=94) who received oxaliplatin had a significantly better progression-free survival (6.0 vs 
3.1  months;  p  =  0.029)  than  those  who  received  cisplatin.  Patients  who  received  oxaliplatin-based 
treatment  experienced  less  anaemia,  alopecia,  vomiting,  nausea,  fatigue,  renal  toxicity,  and 
thromboembolism, but more peripheral neuropathy and elevations of the serum AST or ALT than those 
who received cisplatin treatment. The study was not powered to test overall survival, but survival was 
reported similar between the two groups (10.7 months oxaliplatin vs 8.8 months cisplatin) (Al-Batran, 
2008).

-A meta-analysis of data from the phase 2 and phase 3 trials discussed above concluded that regimens 
containing oxaliplatin were associated with a moderately improved progression-free survival (HR 0.88; 
p  =  0.02),  and  overall  survival  (HR  0.88;  p  =  0.04)  compared  to  cisplatin  in  patients  with  advanced 
gastric cancer (Montagnani, 2011). Comparison of the toxicity showed that oxaliplatin was associated 
with less grade 3/4 neutropenia (OR = 0.53; p < 0.01), but more diarrhea (OR = 2.73, p < 0.01) and 
neurotoxicity (OR = 6.91; p < 0.01). 
-A  recent  review  concluded  that  oxaliplatin  can  substitute  cisplatin  in  the  treatment  of  gastric  cancer 
due to the non-inferior efficacy and good tolerability of this agent in combination with fluoropyrimidines 
(Lordick, 2014). 
About the product 
S-1,  also  known  as  TS-1  or  Teysuno,  is  an  oral  combination  of  three  active  substances,  tegafur, 
gimeracil,  and  oteracil.  After  absorption,  tegafur  is  converted  by  the  liver  into  5-fluorouracil  (5-FU). 
Gimeracil is a dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) inhibitor that prevents degradation of 5-FU by 
the  body  and  thus  increases  its  availability.  Oteracil  decreases  the  breakdown  of  5-FU  into  toxic 
metabolites  in  normal  gastrointestinal  mucosa  and  thus  may  reduce  toxic  side  effects  of  the  drug 
through inhibition of orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT) (Matt, 2011).  
Approval  of  S-1  in  combination  with  cisplatin  in  advanced  gastric  cancer  patients  in  the  EU  was 
primarily  based  on  results  from  the  First  Line  Advanced  Gastric  Cancer  Study  (FLAGS)  (Ajani,  2010). 
FLAGS was a phase 3, open-label, randomised, 2-arm study, conducted in 1053 patients at 147 sites in 
24  countries  in  Europe,  North  America,  Latin  America,  Australia,  and  Africa,  tested  the  efficacy  and 
safety  of  oral  S-1  plus  cisplatin  compared  to  infusional  5-FU  plus  cisplatin  in  patients  with  advanced 
gastric  cancer  previously  untreated  with  chemotherapy  for  advanced  disease  (Ajani,  2010).  Patients 
were randomized to receive S-1 (25 mg/m2 twice per day for 21 days) plus  cisplatin (75 mg/m2 i.v. 
on day 1 of 28 days) or infusional 5-FU (1000 mg/m2/24 hours as a 120-hour infusion) plus cisplatin 
(100  mg/m2  i.v.  on  day  1  of  28  days).  The  combination  of  S-1  plus  cisplatin  did  not  improve  the 
primary endpoint of overall survival compared to 5-FU plus cisplatin (8.6 months S-1/cisplatin vs 7.9 
months 5-FU/cisplatin, p=0.20). There were also no significant differences between the two treatments 
in terms of progression free survival (4.8 months S-1/cisplatin vs 5.5 months 5-FU/cisplatin, p=0.92), 
and  response  rates  (29.1%  S-1/cisplatin  vs  31.9%  5-FU/cisplatin,  p=0.4).  Patients  who  received  S- 
1/cisplatin  had  significantly  reduced  rates  of  grade  3/4  neutropenia  (32.3%  vs  63.6%),  complicated 
neutropenia  (5.0%  vs  14.4%),  stomatitis  (1.3%  vs  13.6%),  and  hypokalemia  (3.6%  vs  10.8%),  and 
treatment-related  death  (2.5%  vs  4.9%)  (p<0.05),  at  least  partly  related  to the  lower  cisplatin-dose 
administered in the  S-1 arm. CHMP concluded that  non-inferiority of S-1+ cisplatin vs 5FU+ cisplatin 
was demonstrated (European public assessment report, EMA). 
In 2011, S-1, in combination with cisplatin (75 mg/m2 day 1), was approved in the EU for treatment of 
adults with advanced gastric cancer at a dose of 25 mg/m2 orally, twice per  day for 21 days of  a 4-
week cycle.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.  
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
S-1, also known as TS-1 or Teysuno, is an oral combination of three active substances, tegafur, 
gimeracil, and oteracil. After absorption, tegafur is converted by the liver into 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). 
Gimeracil and oteracil are included to reduce the metabolism of 5-FU thereby improving the 
bioavailability of 5-FU and reducing the toxic effects of its metabolites.  
S-1 (25 mg/m2) is currently approved for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer when given in 
combination with cisplatin (75 mg/m2).   
To support the inclusion of oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2) as an alternative to cisplatin in combination with S-
1 for treatment of patients with advanced gastric cancer,  a summary of pharmacokinetic data were 
provided for S-1 in combination with oxaliplatin and bevacizumab in patients with advanced solid 
tumours (study TPU-S1109, Chung et al. 2011).  
In this study, stage A was a 3-week cycle in which S-1 was started at 20 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 
consecutive days, and escalated by 5 mg/m2, plus oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2) and bevacizumab (7.5 
mg/kg IV) on day 1 of each 3-week cycle. Stage B was a 2-week cycle of S-1 administered at 25 
mg/m2 twice daily for 7 consecutive days, and escalated by 5 mg/m2, plus oxaliplatin (85 mg/m2) and 
bevacizumab (5 mg/kg IV) on day 1 of each 2-week cycle. The MTD of S-1 in combination with a fixed 
dose of oxaliplatin and bevacizumab was determined to be 25 mg/m2 twice per day for 14 days of the 
3-week cycle and 35 mg/m2 twice per day for 7 days of the 2- week cycle. According to the applicant, 
both regimens were safe and well-tolerated. PK measurements (Stage A only) revealed no PK 
interactions between S-1 components and oxaliplatin. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No data were submitted to support this application. 
2.3.4.  Discussion and conclusion on clinical pharmacology 
To support the PK of the combination with oxaliplatin, the applicant submitted a summary of PK data 
for S-1 in combination with oxaliplatin and bevacizumab in patients with advanced solid tumours 
(study TPU-S1109). The study report, however, was not submitted (OC). The provided 
pharmacokinetic data indicated that there is no pharmacokinetic interaction between the S-1 
components and oxaliplatin. 
Not only is the applicant applying for inclusion of oxaliplatin as an alternative to cisplatin but implicitly 
also for carboplatin and for combination with oxaliplatin and other agents like epirubicin. The PK 
characteristics of the three platinum compounds are not identical and moreover the dosing regimen 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/641866/2014 
Page 6/28 
 
 
 
  
 
 
(dose and frequency) is different. Therefore, the applicant is requested to submit data supporting the 
various combinations with S-1. 
The platinum products currently available are cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin. The 
pharmacokinetic characteristics and mechanism of action of these three platinum compounds are not 
identical. Also the safety profile, and dosing regimen and scheme (every 2 weeks, every 3 weeks or 
every 4 weeks) is different for these compounds.  Therefore, interchangeability of these platinum 
compounds should be substantiated by clinical efficacy and safety data. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The data supporting the extension of indication of S-1 (Teysuno, TS1) in combination with platinum-
regimens in patients with advanced gastric cancer is based on: 
1-  Regarding the combination Oxaliplatin-S1:  
a.  the interim results of the phase 1, open-label dose-finding TPU-S1119 study where S-1 
was  administered  in  combination  with  oxaliplatin  and  epirubicin  in  patients  with 
advanced solid tumours (Cohort 1 and 2) and in 7 patients with esophagogastric cancer 
(cohort 3) (table 1); 
b.  the phase I TPU-S1109 trial, where patients with advanced solid tumours were treated 
in the USA with the combination S1-oxaliplatin-bevacizumab, in a 3-weekly (Stage A) 
and in a 2-weekly (Stage B) scheme (table 1); 
c.  other studies reported in the literature have been mentioned as supportive, but in most 
of the cases they were conducted in non-Caucasian patients (table 2). 
2-   Regarding the combination Cisplatin-S1: 
a.  The studies provided/assessed during the original MAA in EU of S-1 in combination with 
cisplatin in patients with advanced gastric cancer (table 3). 
A  description  of  the  clinical  studies  included  in  the  S-1  development  program  in  support  of  the 
proposed extension of the indication is given in the following tables.

2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
The  combination  of  S1  and  cisplatin  has  been  adequately  explored  in  the  phase  I/II  S1101  study 
conducted  in  patients  with  advanced  solid  tumours  and  in  the  phase  III  S1301  (FLAGS)  study 
conducted  in  patients  with  unresectable  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  gastric  cancer.  For  further 
information over the combination cisplatin-S1 reference is made to the original EU MAA of S-1. 
The  combination  of  S1  with  oxaliplatin  has  been  explored  in  two  phase  I  studies  conducted  in 
Caucasians: the TPU-S1119 study exploring the combination S1 + oxaliplatin + epirubicin and the TPU-
S1109 trial exploring the combination S1+oxaliplatin + bevacizumab.

1)  COMBINATION S-1 - OXALIPLATIN 
TPU-S1119: A phase 1, open-label, non-randomized, dose-finding, safety 
and tolerability study of orally administered teysuno (s-1) in combination 
with epirubicin and oxaliplatin in patients with advanced solid tumours 
(cohorts 1 and 2) and esophagogastric cancer (cohort 3)

The study population was comprised of male and female patients 18 years or older with histologically 
or pathologically confirmed solid tumour(s) for which no established curative therapy exists (Cohorts 1 
and 2) and advanced or metastatic esophagogastric cancer previously not treated (Cohort 3). Patients 
had  an  Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology  Group  (ECOG)  performance  status  score  of  0  or  1  on  Cycle  1, 
Day 1 and a life expectancy of at least 3 months. Patient were able to take medications orally, had left 
ventricular  ejective  fraction  (LVEF)  ≥  the  lower  limit  of  normal  (LLN)  for  the  institution,  had  serum 
troponin T or troponin I and creatine phosphokinase (CPK)-MB values ≤ upper limit of normal (ULN) for 
the institution, and had adequate organ function.  
Study was conducted at 3 sites in Germany and at 3 additional sites in Czech Republic and one site in 
the United Kingdom. 
Treatments 
Each treatment cycle was 21 days in duration. One treatment cycle consisted of the following: 
Day 1:  
- Epirubicin 50 mg/m², via an IV bolus immediately prior to oxaliplatin according 
to the institution’s standard of practice. Epirubicin was limited to a maximum of 8 
cycles. 
-  Oxaliplatin  130  mg/m²,  via  a  2-hour  IV  infusion  according  to  the  institution’s 
standard of practice. Oxaliplatin was limited to a maximum of 8 cycles. 
- The first S-1 dose (20 mg/m2 or 25 mg/m²) was taken in the evening of Day 1. 
Days 2 through 15 
- S-1 20 mg/m2 or 25 mg/m² orally 2 times daily on Day 2 through Day 14. The 
last dose of S-1 per cycle was administered on the morning of Day 15. There was 
no limit on the number of cycles for S-1. 
Days 15 through 21 
- Recovery 
Cohorts 1 and 2 
Patients  were  assigned  to  2  cohorts  sequentially.  Oxaliplatin  130  mg/m2  and  epirubicin  50  mg/m2 
doses  were  fixed  and  given  on  day  1  of  each  3-week  cycle.  S-1  dose  was  escalated  by  cohort  of 
patients according to the following scheme: 
• Dose Level 1: 20 mg/m2 BID (40 mg/m2/day) 
• Dose Level 2: 25 mg/m2 BID (50 mg/m2/day) 
The first dose of S-1 was administered in the evening of Day 1 of each cycle and twice daily on Days 2 
through 14 of each cycle.  The last dose of S-1 per cycle was administered on the morning of Day15, 
followed  by  a  recovery  period  from  Day  15  through  Day  21.  Oxaliplatin  and  epirubicin  were 
administered for a maximum of 8 cycles of treatment. 
Cohort 3 
In  Cohort  3  previously  untreated  patients  with  advanced  esophagogastric  cancer  were  enrolled. 
Patients  received  S-1  25  mg/m2  BID  (50  mg/m2/day);  Oxaliplatin  130  mg/m2  and  epirubicin  50 
mg/m2 doses were fixed. Patients received S-1 starting the evening of Day 1 of each cycle and BID on 
Days 2 through 14 of each cycle. The last dose of S-1 per cycle was administered on the morning of 
Day15,  followed  by  a  recovery  period  from  Day  15  through  Day  21.  Oxaliplatin  and  epirubicin  were 
administered for a maximum of 8 cycles of treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/641866/2014 
Page 10/28 
 
 
 
  
 
 
A dose of 25 mg/m2 of S-1 in the regimen was established as MTD in the second part of the study for 
esophagogastric patients in first line treatment (Cohort 3). 
Objectives 
The primary objectives of this study were: 
• Pre-Amendment 3 (Cohorts 1 and 2): To investigate the safety and determine the MTD of S-1, either 
20  mg/m2  or  25  mg/m2,  when  combined  with  epirubicin  50  mg/m2  and  oxaliplatin  130  mg/m2  in 
patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumours. 
• Amendment 3 (Cohort 3): To investigate the safety and determine the MTD of S-1 25 mg/m2 when 
combined  with  epirubicin  50  mg/m2  and  oxaliplatin  130  mg/m2  in  patients  with  advanced  or 
metastatic esophagogastric cancer in the first line therapy. 
The MTD was defined as the highest dose level at which less than 33% of the patients experienced a 
dose-limiting  toxicity  (DLT)  during  Cycle  1.  After  the  MTD  was  determined,  up  to  6  additional 
confirmatory patients were to be treated at the MTD level. 
Secondary objectives were: 
•  To  document  any  antitumor  activity  observed  with  S-1  administered  in  this  combination  treatment 
regimen 
Outcomes/endpoints 
- Efficacy Measurements 
Tumour assessments were performed and summarized / surveyed to evaluate secondary objectives in 
the  interim  report  for  Cohorts  1  and  2.  Antitumor  activity  observed  with  S-  1  will  be  available  in  the 
final Clinical Study Report. 
The assessment of overall response rate (ORR) was based on Investigator-supplied objective measures 
of  disease  after  review  of  radiologic  images,  computed  tomography  (CT)  or  magnetic  resonance 
imaging  (MRI)  scans,  and  following  RECIST  criteria  (version  1.1  2009).  Overall  response  rate  was 
defined  as  the  proportion  of  patients  with  objective  evidence  of  CR  or  PR.  Patients  were  assigned  to 
one of the categories of change in disease state, namely, “complete response (CR),” “partial response 
(PR),”  “stable  disease  (SD),”  “progressive  disease  (PD),”  or  “not  evaluable  (NE).”  Efficacy  data  were 
based on tumour response using RECIST criteria assessed every 3 cycles.  
Progression free survival (PFS) was defined as the time (in months) from the date of first dose of S-1 
until  the  date  of  the  investigator-assessed  radiological  disease  progression,  clinical  progression  or 
death due to any cause. Patients who were alive with no disease progression as of the analysis cut-off 
date  were  censored  at  the  date  of  the  last  tumour  assessment.  An  additional  analysis  was  based  on 
only  radiologic  images  (i.e.  excluding  clinical  progression).  Patients  with  clinical  but  not  radiologic 
evidence of progression were censored at the date of the last radiologic tumour assessment. 
Overall survival (OS) was defined as time from the first dose of S-1 to the date of death. Patients who 
did not die were censored at the date last known to be alive. 
Treatment was to be continued until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. 
Each patient was followed for survival every 2 months for up to 12 months after the first dose of study 
medication.

Safety  assessments  included  determination  of  the  incidence,  severity,  and  causality  of  AEs  and  SAEs 
and other safety parameters as follows: 
• Physical examination 
• Vital signs 
• ECOG performance status 
• 12-lead ECG 
• ECHO  
• Cardiac Enzymes 
• Clinical laboratory evaluations 
• Pregnancy monitoring 
Sample size 
Each  dose  level  in  study  TPU-S1119  involved  a  minimum  of  3  patients.  Escalation  to  Dose  Level  2 
(Cohort  1  only)  occurred  only  after  Dose  Level  1  was  found  to  be  safe  according  to  the  protocol 
criteria.

Statistical methods 
The study populations included safety, DLT evaluable, and efficacy populations. 
Safety Population 
The  safety  population  included  all  patients  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  medication.  This 
population was the primary population for safety evaluation.  
DLT Evaluable Population 
The DLT evaluable population included all patients in the safety population who completed at least one 
cycle  of  study  medication  with  at  least  80%  treatment  compliance,  unless  treatment  was  interrupted 
due to a DLT. 
Efficacy Population 
The efficacy evaluable population included all patients in the safety population who completed at least 
one cycle of study medication and had radiologic or clinical progression assessments performed. In this 
interim report, efficacy data were presented for Cohorts 1 and 2. 
RESULTS 
Patient Disposition: 
Nineteen (19) patients were enrolled in the study, 3 patients in Cohort 1, 6 patients (5 DLT evaluable) 
in Cohort 2, 3 patients in expanded Cohort 1, and 7 patients in Cohort 3.   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/641866/2014

As of the cut-off date (30 April 2014) for the interim report, 7 patients in Cohort 3 were treated and 
the study was completed for 3 out of the 7 patients. All patients in Cohorts 1 and 2 had completed the 
study. Twelve (63.2%) patients were male and 7 (36.8%) were female with a median age of 63 years 
(range, 48 to 77 years). All patients were Caucasian. Ten (52.6%) patients had an ECOG performance 
status  score  of  0  and  9  (47.4%)  patients  had  an  ECOG  score  of  1  at  baseline.  Fourteen  (73.7%) 
patients had previous surgery and 5 (26.3%) patients had no previous surgery. In Cohorts 1 and 2, 7 
(36.8%) patients had previous systemic anticancer therapies: 5 (26.3%) patients had one, 2 (10.5%) 
had  two  previous  therapies,  which  included  one  or  more  of  the  following:  capecitabine,  carboplatin, 
cisplatin, erlotinib, and/or gemcitabine. In Cohort 3 (chemotherapy-naïve patients), no patients had a 
previous systemic anticancer therapy.

Data are based on the cut-off date of 30 April 2014. 
MTDs 
Cohort 1 and 2: The dose of S-1 20 mg/m2 BID was established as the MTD of S-1 in the EOS triplet. 
DLTs occurred in patients with non-esophagogastric tumours in the third line treatment. 
Cohort 3: A dose of 25 mg/m2 of S-1 in the regimen was established as MTD in the second part of the 
study for esophagogastric patients in first line treatment. 
Efficacy evaluation 
Efficacy  evaluations  (i.e.,  best  overall  response,  OS,  and  PFS)  were  performed  for  12  patients  in 
Cohorts 1 and 2 at the interim report. The efficacy evaluation of the results of the TPU-S1119 study is 
seriously  hampered  by  the  very  low  number  of  patients  treated.  Moreover,  results  are  related  to  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/641866/2014 
Page 13/28 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Cohort  1  and  2  of  the  study,  where  patients  with  solid  tumours  in  general  and  not  only  patients  as 
indicated in the target population, were enrolled. 
Best Overall Response 
Three  out  of  six  (3/6,  50%)  patients  who  received  S-1  the  20  mg/m2  BID  dose  (cohort  1)  were 
evaluable for response. Stable disease was reported in 1 patient (1/6, 33.3%) and progressive disease 
in 2 patients (2/3, 66.7%). Three out of six patients (3/6, 50%) who received the 25 mg/m2 BID S-1 
dose were evaluable for response (cohort 2). Two patients in cohort 2 had stable disease (2/3, 66.7%) 
and 1 had progressive disease (1/3, 33.3%).  
Table 5. Best Overall Response – Cohorts 1 and 2 
Preliminary data of Cohort 3 (treated with 25 mg/m2 BID S-1 dose) reported one patient progressed 
after a best overall response of stable disease.  
Progression free Survival 
The  median  PFS  was  1.9  months  for  patients  in  Cohort  1  and  3.9  months  (95%  CI:  1.9,  1.9)  for 
patients in the Cohort 2 (95% CI: 2.0, 11.2). 
Overall Survival 
At least 15 months follow-up data were available for all patients in Cohort 1 and 2. Median OS was 5.8 
months  for  Cohort  1  (95%  CI:  4.5,  13.1)  and  8.7  months  for  Cohort  2  (95%  CI:  6.5,  -).  The  1-year 
Kaplan-Meier survival estimate was 33.0% in Cohort 1 and 44.4% in Cohort 2. 
TPU-S1109 trial 
TPU-S1109 was a phase 1 dose escalation study in patients with advanced solid tumours designed to 
identify the MTD of S-1 when used in combination with fixed doses of oxaliplatin and bevacizumab in 
2- or 3-week treatment regimens and to determine whether there were any PK interactions between S-
1  components  and  oxaliplatin.  No  clinical  study  report  related  to  this  study,  but  only  a  literature 
reference,  has  been  provided.  This  hampers  adequate  assessment  of  the  data  provided.  The  limited 
number of patients treated and the lack of information related to the number of patients with advanced 
gastric  cancer  eventually  enrolled  in  this  study  further  challenge  the  interpretation  of  the  results. 
Furthermore, currently bevacizumab is not registered for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer. 
Stage A was a 3-week cycle in which S-1 was started at 20 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 consecutive days, 
and escalated by 5 mg/m2, plus oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2 IV) and bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg IV) on day 1 
of each 3-week cycle.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/641866/2014 
Page 14/28 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Stage B was a 2-week cycle of S-1 administered at 25 mg/m2 twice daily for 7 consecutive days, and 
escalated  by  5  mg/m2,  plus  oxaliplatin  (85  mg/m2  IV)  and  bevacizumab  (5  mg/kg  IV)  on  day  1  of 
each 2-week cycle.  
Efficacy  data  were  analysed  using  Response  Evaluation  Criteria  in  Solid  Tumours  (RECIST  Criteria 
version 1.1). CT-scans were performed every 2 cycles.  
Antitumor  activity  was  evaluated  in  terms  of  objective  response  rate  (ORR)  and  progression-free 
survival (PFS). Overall survival (OS) at 12 months was also summarized. 
For  Stage  A,  23/24  (95.8%)  patients  were  included  in  the  Efficacy  Population.  One  patient  (patient 
001-024, 25 mg/m2 dose group) was not evaluable for efficacy due to the lack of post-baseline tumour 
assessment.  Two  (2/23,  8.7%)  patients  in  the  25  mg/m2  dose  group  had  a  partial  response  to  S-1 
combination  treatment,  17  (73.9%)  patients  had  a  best  overall  response  of  stable  disease  and  4 
(17.4%) patients had progressive disease.  
For  Stage  B,  23/24  (95.8%)  patients  were  included  in  the  Efficacy  Population.  Patient  001-041  (35 
mg/m2  dose  group)  was  not  evaluable  for  efficacy  due  to  the  lack  of  a  post-baseline  tumour 
assessment. Eight (34.8%) patients across all dose groups had a partial response to S-1 combination 
treatment, 10 (43.5%) patients had a best overall response of stable disease, and 5 (21.7%) patients 
had progressive disease. 
2)  COMBINATION S-1 - CISPLATIN 
The efficacy of the combination S-1 –cisplatin has been established during the original EU MAA for S-1. 
Evidence of the anti-tumour activity of S-1 in combination with cisplatin for the treatment of patients 
with gastric cancer was provided by three Phase 3 studies conducted in advanced gastric cancer (JCOG 
9912, 91023039/SPIRITS  and S1301/FLAGS), all of which  had a primary endpoint of overall survival.  
Study S1301/FLAGS is considered the pivotal source of efficacy of S-1 in combination with cisplatin in 
Western  population.  Supportive  efficacy  data  was  provided  by  one  Phase  1/2  study  conducted  in  the 
US and Germany (S1101). 
The  pivotal  S1301/FLAGS  [First-Line  Advanced  Gastric  Study]  study  was  an  open-label  randomized 
Phase III clinical trial that evaluated S-1 + Cisplatin versus 5-FU + Cisplatin in patients with advanced 
gastric  cancer  previously  untreated  with  chemotherapy  for  advanced  disease.  Results  from  the  study 
revealed  non-inferiority  of  the  S1+Cisplatin  combination  compared  with  5FU+cisplatin  in  terms  of 
overall  survival  (median  OS  8.6  vs  7.9  months  with  S1+cisplatin  and  5FU+cisplatin,  respectively,  HR 
0.92, 95% CI: 0.80-1.05, p=0.1983) and other clinically relevant secondary endpoints like PFS, ORR, 
duration of response, time to progression. 
Further information is available in the EPAR related to the original MAA for Teysuno. 
3)  COMBINATION S-1 - CARBOPLATIN 
No data have been provided by the MAH regarding the  efficacy  of  the  combination  S1+carboplatin  in 
patients with advanced gastric cancer nor in Caucasians.  
Few abstracts/articles are available in the literature regarding phase I-III studies with the combination 
S1+carboplatin  in  Japanese  patients  with  NSCLC  (Tamura  K  et  al  JCO  2006,  Yoshioka  H  et  al  Ann 
Oncol 2013, Urata Y et al Cancer 2013).

Clinical studies in special populations 
The small number of patients treated with the combination S-1+ epirubicin + oxaliplatin hampers 
efficacy evaluation in different populations and ages categories.  
2.4.3.  Discussion and Conclusions on the Clinical Efficacy 
The  present  type  II  variation  appears  to  be  supported  by  the  results  of  studies  where  oxaliplatin 
substituted cisplatin. However the proposed wording of indication is more general as “platinum-based 
regimens”  would  include  also  “carboplatin-based  regimens”.  No  data  regarding  the  combination 
Carboplatin-S1 have been provided. 
The  efficacy  of  S1  in  combination  with  cisplatin  has  been  explored  in  the  pivotal  phase  III  (FLAGS) 
study, comparing the combination S1+ cisplatin with 5FU+cisplatin in the target population. The non-
inferiority  of  the  combination  S1+  cisplatin  versus  S1+  5FU  has  been  assessed  during  the  original 
submission regarding the  MAA of  Teysuno in patients with advanced gastric cancer and is considered 
demonstrated. 
Essentially,  the  modification  of  the  wording  of  the  indication  in  order  to  substitute  the  compound 
“cisplatin”  with  the  generic  diction  “platinum-based  regimen”  is  based  on  the  interim  analysis  of  one 
phase  I  dose-finding  study  (TPU-S1119)  conducted  with  S1+  oxaliplatin  +  epirubicine,  in  Caucasian 
patients with advanced solid tumors (Cohort 1 and 2) and in 7 patients with advanced esophagogastric 
cancer (cohort 3) where apparently no PK data in order to exclude an interaction were collected.  
The design and the number of patients treated in the study do not allow a compelling evaluation of the 
efficacy of the scheme in the target population as proposed. 
Other  studies  reported  in  the  literature  are  mentioned,  but,  with  the  exception  of  another  phase  I 
study (TPU-S1109) published by  Chung et al., which was conducted in USA,  all the other articles are 
related to study performed in Asians. In the phase I TPU-S1109 study, PK data over the combination 
oxaliplatin + S1 + bevacizumab were collected, but no clinical study report has been provided by the 
MAH.  Extrapolation  of  efficacy  and  safety  from  Asians  to  Caucasians  is  not  readily  acceptable  due  to 
potential racial differences in efficacy and safety of S-1 (for instance, racial differences in CYP2A6 and 
related SNPs lead to difference in tegafur metabolism), as well as in the biology and natural history of 
gastric  cancer.  Moreover,  evaluation  of  the  supportive  studies  is  hampered  by  the  lack  of  compelling 
information  regarding  such  studies,  as  only  published  articles  have  been  reported.  Furthermore,  it 
should be noted that in all the studies reported in the literature with S1 in combination with oxaliplatin 
and performed in non-Caucasian patients, the dose and scheme of S1 used are different from the one 
proposed for registration in EU  
No efficacy data have been provided over S-1 in combination with carboplatin (another clinically used 
platinum compound). 
Assessment report

Data are considered too scarce to allow adequate evaluation of the efficacy of S1 in combination with 
platinum compounds –other than cisplatin in the target population of advanced gastric cancer. 
Extrapolation of the known efficacy results of 5FU/capecitabine in combination with platinum regimens 
in  the  target  population  to  S-1  is  not  considered  appropriate,  in  view  of  the  known  differences  in 
pharmacological  characteristics,  mechanism  of  action,  schema/dosing  regimen  and  toxicity  between 
the platinum compounds available. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The safety database that establishes the foundation for this type II variation of S-1 (Teysuno, TS1) in 
combination with platinum-regimens in patients with advanced gastric cancer is based on: 
1-  Regarding the combination Oxaliplatin-S1:  
a.  the interim results of the phase 1, open-label dose-finding TPU-S1119 study where S-1 
was  administered  in  combination  with  oxaliplatin  and  epirubicin  in  patients  with 
advanced solid tumours (Cohort 1 and 2) and in 7 patients with esophagogastric cancer 
(cohort 3); 
b.  the phase I TPU-S1109 trial, where patients with advanced solid tumours were treated 
in USA with the combination S1-oxaliplatin-bevacizumab, in a 3-weekly (Stage A) and 
in a 2-weekly (Stage B) schema; 
2-  Regarding the combination Cisplatin-S1: 
a.  The  database  provided/assessed  during  the  original  MAA  in  EU  of  S-1  in  combination 
with cisplatin in patients with advanced gastric cancer. These data will be discussed in 
summary  as  they  have  been  already  assessed  previously.  For  more  information 
reference is made to the original EU MAA of Teysuno.  
The safety database in support of this type II variation consists of around 600 patients with advanced 
gastric cancer treated with Teysuno in combination with a platinum based regimen, the great majority 
of which (98%) treated with S1+ cisplatin.  
TPU-S1119 trial 
Patient exposure 
Patients were assigned to 2 cohorts sequentially. Oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2) and epirubicin (50 mg/m2) 
doses were fixed. S-1 dose was escalated by cohort of patients according to the following scheme: 
•  Cohort 1: 20 mg/m2 BID (40 mg/m2/day) – advanced solid tumours (part 1) 
•  Cohort 2: 25 mg/m2 BID (50 mg/m2/day) – advanced solid tumours (part 1) 
•  Cohort 3: 25 mg/m2 BID (50 mg/m2/day) – oesophagogastric cancer (AEGC, part 2) 
Escalation to Dose Level 2 (cohort 2) occurred only after Dose Level 1 was found to be safe according 
to  the  protocol  criteria.  Intra-patient  dose  escalation  was  not  allowed.  The  MTD  was  defined  as  the 
highest dose level at which less than 33% (≤1/6) of the patients experienced a dose-limiting toxicity 
(DLT)  during  Cycle  1.  Once  the  MTD  was  established,  the  cohort  was  to  be  expanded  to  up  to  12

patients.  The DLT evaluable population included all patients in the safety population who completed at 
least  one  cycle  of  study  medication  with  at  least  80%  treatment  compliance,  unless  treatment  was 
interrupted due to a DLT. A DLT was defined as the following: 
a. ≥ Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity (excluding nausea/vomiting, diarrhoea). 
b. ≥ Grade 3 nausea/vomiting uncontrolled by aggressive antiemetic support. 
c. ≥ Grade 3 diarrhoea lasting more than 24 hours despite antidiarrheal treatment. 
d.  Febrile  neutropenia  (absolute  neutrophil  count  [ANC]  <1.0  x  109/L  with  a  single  temperature  of 
>38.3°C or a sustained temperature of >38°C for more than one hour). 
e. Grade 4 neutropenia lasting ≥5 days. 
f. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia associated with dose interruption or hemorrhage. 
g. Any drug-related toxicity resulting in >1 week delay in initiation of Cycle 2 (i.e., cannot start Cycle 2 
until Day 29 or later). 
h. Any drug-related toxicity that results in administration of <80% of total planned S-1 dose. 
Adverse  events  were  coded  according  to  the  Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA) 
terminology and the severity of the toxicities was graded according to the NCI CTCAE, v4.03. 
Twelve  (11  DLT  evaluable)  patients  with  solid  tumours  with  any  number  of  previous  therapies  for 
advanced  or  metastatic  disease  were  enrolled.  No  DLTs  were  observed  in  Cohort  1  (S-1  20  mg/m2 
BID). Two patients in Cohort 2 reported DLTs (Grade 3 elevated gamma GT and peripheral neuropathy 
in one patient, and febrile neutropenia in another patient who died five days later due to pneumonia). 
The  MTD  in  an  AEGC  population  who  receive  EOS  as  first-line  treatment  might  be  potentially  higher, 
therefore, a new cohort of previously untreated AEGC patients (Cohort 3) was administered 25 mg/m2 
S1  BID  in  combination  with  oxaliplatin  130  mg/m2  and  epirubicin  50  mg/m2  (Amendment  3)  to 
determine  the  MTD  in  this  population.  Six  of  7  patients  enrolled  in  Cohort  3  were  evaluable  for  DLT 
assessment, no DLTs occurred in Cycle 1. The dose of S-1 25 mg/m2/dose BID was established as the 
MTD of S-1 in the EOS triplet for chemo-naïve patients with esophagogastric tumours. 
A total of 8 (42.1%) patients had at least 4 cycles of treatment. Three (15.8%) patients had >4 cycles 
initiated.  One  patient  (5.3%)  initiated  a  maximum  of  15  cycles.  A  mean  of  3.7  cycles  and  median  of 
3.0 cycles were initiated by all patients. 
Adverse events  
The safety reported for the combination is related to an interim preliminary safety evaluation including 
19 patients who had completed Cycle 1 of the study as of the cut-off date of 30 April 2014, including 6 
patients in Cohort 1 (20 mg/m2 BID), 6 patients in Cohort 2 (25 mg/m2 BID) and 7 patients in Cohort 
3 (25 mg/m2 BID).Number are considered too small to allow adequate evaluation of the safety of the 
combination in the target population. 
No DLTs were observed in Cohort 1 (S-1 20 mg/m2 BID). Two patients in Cohort 2 reported DLTs: one 
patient  experienced  DLTs  of  Grade  3  elevated  gamma  GT  and  peripheral  neuropathy,  and  another 
patient (with generalized cholangiocarcinoma and two courses of previous chemotherapy) experienced 
DLT of febrile neutropenia on the Day 9 of Cycle 1 and died five days later due to pneumonia. A patient 
in cohort 3 experienced grade 3 AST increase and grade 4 neutropenia on day 12 of Cycle 1 but was 
not DLT evaluable as eligibility criteria were violated due to alcohol abuse.

As of the cut-off date of 10 April 2014 (all patients; Cohorts 1, 2, and 3), the most frequently reported 
treatment-emergent AEs were anaemia (n=5 patients), neutropenia (n=10), thrombocytopenia (n=6), 
abdominal  pain  (n=4),  diarrhoea  (n=8),  nausea  (n=11),  vomiting  (n=8),  fatigue  (n=8),  neuropathy 
peripheral  (n=4),  paraesthesia  (n=8),  and  alopecia  (n=5).  The  most  frequently  reported  study 
medication  related  AEs  were  neutropenia  (n=9  patients),  thrombocytopenia  (n=6),  diarrhoea  (n=6), 
nausea (n=8), vomiting (n=4), fatigue (n=4), and alopecia (n=5).  
Grade 4 reported AEs include neutropenia (n=2 patients, n=1 in Cohorts 1 and 3), febrile neutropenia 
(n=1,  Cohort  2),  hyponatraemia  (n=1,  Cohort  2),  and  renal  failure  acute  (n=1;  Cohort  1).  Grade  3 
reported  AEs  include  neutropenia  (n=7),  thrombocytopenia  (n=3),  nausea  (n=1),  fatigue  (n=1), 
general physical health deterioration (n=1), bile duct stenosis (n=2), hypersensitivity (n=1), gamma-
glutamyltransferase increased (n=1), neutrophil count decreased (n=1), neuropathy peripheral (n=1), 
and hypotension (n=1). 
Grade 5 study medication-related AEs included pneumonia (n=1, Cohort 2). Grade 4 study medication 
related AEs included neutropenia (n=2 patients, Cohorts 1 and 3) and febrile neutropenia (n=1, Cohort 
2).  Grade  3  study  medication  related  AEs  included  neutropenia  (n=6),  thrombocytopenia  (n=3), 
nausea  (n=1),  fatigue  (n=1),  gammaglutamyltransferase  increased  (n=1),  and  neutrophil  count 
decreased (n=1). 
Patients  enrolled  in  the  TPU-S1119  study  were  required  to  have  adequate  left  ventricular  ejection 
fraction  at  baseline.  According  to  the  study  protocol,  Echocardiogram,  ECG  and  evaluation  of  cardiac 
enzymes  were  regularly  performed  in  patients  enrolled  in  the  study.  The  MAH  should  clarify  whether 
reductions of left ventricular ejection fraction or other cardiac adverse events/significant abnormalities 
were observed in the patients treated and whether such findings should result to inclusion of a warning 
over this issue in the SmPC. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Nineteen (19) treatment-emergent SAEs occurred in 9 patients. The majority of SAEs resolved except 
acute renal failure in patient 001-010, hyperbilirubinemia and bile duct stenosis in patient 001-011, 
general physical health deterioration in patient 005-101, and patient 001-005 - the patient died. Six of 
these SAEs that occurred in 2 patients were S-1 related: neutropenia in patient 001-001; and 
pneumonia, cholangitis, thrombocytopenia, sepsis, and febrile neutropenia in patient 001-005. 
Safety in special populations 
No specific data have been provided. The small number of patients treated with the combination S-1+ 
epirubicin  +  oxaliplatin  hampers  the  evaluation  of  the  toxicity  in  different  populations  and  age 
categories. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Cohort 1 – 20 mg/m2 
• Patient 1 completed 4 cycles with S-1 dose reduction to 15 mg/m2 in Cycle 3 and 4 due to Grade 3 
thrombocytopenia. The treatment had been stopped due to the disease progression. 
• Patient 2 completed 3 cycles without S-1 dose reduction. The treatment had been stopped due to the 
disease progression. 
Assessment report

•  Patient  3  completed  4  cycles  with  S-1  dose  reduction  to  15  mg/m2  in  Cycle  2.  The  treatment  was 
interrupted on Day 8 of Cycle 3 due to Grade 3 thrombocytopenia. 
• Patient 4 completed 4 cycles with S-1 dose reduction to 15 mg/m2 in Cycle 2 due to a decrease in 
BSA  from  1.93  m2  (80  mg  dose)  to  1.8  m2  (70  mg  dose).  In  Cycle  4,  S-1  was  discontinued  due  to 
acute renal failure. 
• Patient 5 completed 4 cycles with S-1 dose reduction to 15 mg/m2 in Cycle 2 due to a decrease in 
BSA from 2.2 m2 (90 mg dose) to 2.1 m2 (80 mg dose). The treatment was stopped in Cycle 4 due to 
Grade 3 hyperbilirubinemia and disease progression. 
• Patient 6 completed 3 cycles without S-1 dose reduction. The treatment had been stopped due to the 
disease progression. 
Cohort 2 – 25 mg/m2 
• Patient 7 completed 10 cycles with S-1 dose reduction to 20 mg/m2 in Cycle 6. The treatment was 
stopped due to the disease progression.  
•  Patient  8  had  S-1  treatment  discontinued  on  Day  9  of  Cycle  1  due  to  a  DLT  (Grade  4  febrile 
neutropenia). The patient died 5 days later due to pneumonia. 
•  Patient  9  completed  3  cycles  with  S-1  dose  reduction  to  15  mg/m2  in  Cycle  3.  The  treatment  was 
interrupted  in  Cycle  1  due  to  the  planned  anaesthesia  for  stent  implantation.  Due  to  a  low  S-1 
compliance (71%) the patient was not evaluable (the limit was ≥ 80%). 
• Patient 10 completed 15 cycles with S-1 dose reduction to 20 mg/m2 in Cycle 2. The treatment was 
stopped due to disease progression.  
•  Patient  11  had  S-1  treatment  discontinued  on  Day  8  of  Cycle  1  due  to  a  DLT  (elevation  of  Gamma 
GT-Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity). 
• Patient 12 completed 6 cycles with S-1 dose reduction to 20 mg/m2 from Cycle 4. The treatment was 
stopped due to the disease progression. 
The S-1 dose in patients 7, 10 and 12 was reduced after the second DLT occurred in the Cohort 2. It 
was  decided  that  at  all  ongoing  patients  in  the  cohort  2  (25mg/m2),  the  dose  should  be  reduced  to 
20mg/m2 at the beginning of their next cycle.  
Cohort 3 – 25 mg/m2 (preliminary data – cut-off date April 30, 2014) 
• Patient 13 completed Cycle 1 without DLT. The treatment was ongoing as of the cut-off date. 
• Patient 14 completed Cycle 1 without DLT. The treatment was ongoing as of the cut-off date. 
• Patient 15 completed Cycle 1 without DLT. The treatment was ongoing as of the cut-off date. 
•  Patient  16  completed  4  cycles  without  S-1  dose  reduction.  The  treatment  was  discontinued  after 
Cycle 4 due to disease progression. 
•  Patient  17  had  S-1  treatment  interrupted  on  Day  12  of  Cycle  1  due  to  Grade  3  AST  increase  and 
other AEs. This patient had not met eligibility criteria, therefore was not DLT evaluable. 
• Patient 18 completed Cycle 1 without DLT. 
•  Patient  19  completed  Cycle  1  without  DLT.  The  treatment  was  discontinued  after  Cycle  1  due  to 
dysphagia related to the oesophageal stent replacement.

TPU-S1109 Trial 
Only a literature reference has been provided regarding the supportive dose-escalating trial TPU-S1109 
conducted  in  USA  with  the  combination  S1-Oxaliplatin-bevacizumab  in  patients  with  advanced  solid 
tumours (Chung KY, 2011). Two schedules were evaluated:  
-Schedule A: S-1 was administered orally (at a starting dose of 20 mg/m2 and cohort dose escalation 
by 5 mg/m 2 increments), twice daily for 14 consecutive days followed by a 7-day recovery period in a 
21-day cycle. Oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 and bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg were administered intravenously in 
fixed  doses  on  day  1  of  each  3-week  cycle.  Oxaliplatin  was  stopped  after  4  cycles  of  treatment.  A 
minimum 
-Schedule B: S-1 was administered orally (at a starting dose of 25 mg/m2, with cohort dose escalation 
by  5  mg/m2  increments),  twice  daily  on  day  1  for  7  consecutive  days  followed  by  a  7-day  recovery 
period  in  a  14-  day  cycle.  Oxaliplatin  85  mg/m2  and  bevacizumab  5  mg/kg  were  administered 
intravenously in fixed doses on day 1 of each 2-week cycle. Oxaliplatin was stopped after 6 cycles of 
treatment. 
According to the article published adverse events (AEs) were collected according to the National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0. A DLT that occurred during the 
first  2  cycles  for  schedule  A  and  the  first  3  cycles  for  schedule  B  was  defined  as:  grade  >  3  non-
hematologic  toxicity  including  nausea,  vomiting  and  diarrhoea  uncontrolled  by  aggressive  treatment, 
febrile neutropenia, grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, or any failure  of the patient to take > 
80%  of  the  planned  S-1  treatment.  The  S-1  as  well  as  oxaliplatin  doses  were  reduced  or  delayed  if 
patients  experienced  unacceptable  drug-related  toxicity.  The  MTD  was  defined  as  the  highest  dose 
level  at  which  <  33%  of  patients  experienced  a  DLT  during  the  first  2  cycles  for  schedule  A  and  the 
first  3  cycles  for  schedule  B.  Once  the  MTD  was  determined,  additional  6–12  patients  were  to  be 
treated at the same level.  
In  the  schedule  A  with  30-mg/m2  S1  dose,  2  out  of  6  patients  treated  experienced  DLTs:  1  patient 
with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma experienced grade 3 diarrhoea on day 15 of cycle 2 despite 
aggressive  antidiarrheal  treatment,  and  1  patient  with  recurrent  metastatic  undifferentiated 
nasopharyngeal carcinoma developed grade 3 mucositis after the first cycle, tolerating the subsequent 
dose level of S-1 (25 mg/m2) without toxicity. 
In  the  Schedule  B  with  40-mg/m2  S1  dose,  2  out  6  patients  treated  developed  DLTs  (1  patient  with 
grade 3 diarrhoea, fatigue, dehydration, proteinuria, nausea and vomiting, and 1 patient with grade 4 
neutropenia,  grade  3  diarrhoea,  rectal  bleeding  and  dehydration).  Two  out  of  additional  9  patients 
treated  in  the  35-mg/m2  expansion  cohort  developed  DLTs:  one  patient  experienced  grade  3 
abdominal pain and another patient experienced grade 3 diarrhoea. 
Adverse events 
-Schedule  A.  According  to  the  published  article,  only  grade  3  fatigue  was  reported  in  the  20-mg/m2 
dose group. In the 25-mg/m2 dose group, grade 3 (nausea, vomiting, fatigue, diarrhoea, dehydration, 
abdominal pain, hyperbilirubinemia, proteinuria) and a grade 3 hypersensitivity reaction to oxaliplatin 
were  each  reported  in  1  patient  (7%).  In  the  30-mg/m2  dose  group,  grade  3  neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia,  nausea,  dehydration  and  proteinuria  were  each  reported  in  1  patient  (7%)  and 
diarrhoea  in  2  patients  (29%).  In  the  25-mg/m  2  MTD  dose  group,  the  most  common  treatment-
related  AEs  were  fatigue  (71%),  nausea  (64%),  diarrhoea  (50%),  anorexia  (50%)  and  peripheral 
sensory  neuropathy  (43%).  Hematologic  AEs  included  thrombocytopenia  (43%)  with  no  grade  6  3 
bone marrow suppression reported.

-Schedule  B.  All  patients  experienced  at  least  1  treatment-related  AE.  No  grade  3  or  4  treatment-
related  AEs  were  reported  in  the  25-mg/m2  dose  group.  In  the  30-mg/m2  dose  group,  grade  3 
leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and hyperbilirubinemia were each reported in 1 patient (33.3%). In the 
35-mg/m2  MTD  dose  group,  grade  3  anaemia, 
thrombocytopenia,  abdominal  pain  and 
hyperbilirubinemia  were  each  reported  in  1  patient  (8.3%),  and  grade  3  fatigue  and  diarrhoea  were 
each  reported  in  2  patients  (17%).  In  the  35-mg/m2  MTD  dose  group,  the  most  common  AEs  were 
fatigue (75%), diarrhoea (58%) and anorexia (58%). 
S-1 in combination with Cisplatin 
The  marketing  authorisation  of  S-1  in  combination  with  Cisplatin  (for  the  indication  of  first  line 
treatment of advanced gastric cancer) was mainly based on the results of the S1301/FLAGS study, an 
open-label phase III trial performed in a predominantly Caucasian population that randomly compared 
treatment  with  S1+  Cisplatin  versus  infusional  5FU  +  Cisplatin  in  patients  with  advanced  gastric 
cancer.  S-1 was given at the dose regimen established in US and European patients (i.e., 25 mg/m2 
S-1 twice daily for 21 consecutive days) with 75 mg/m2 cisplatin administered in Day 1, and repeated 
every 28 days.   
The  S-1  +  cisplatin  regimen  demonstrated  a  superior  safety  profile  compared  to  that  of  the  5-FU  + 
cisplatin regimen in the S1301/FLAGS study, with clinically important differences in haematologic and 
non-haematologic  toxicity,  as  well  as  a  lower  incidence  of  toxic  deaths  compared  to  the  5-FU  + 
cisplatin regimen. The lower incidence of GI toxicity, particularly stomatitis and mucosal inflammation, 
appeared to be related to S-1 administration, whereas the reduction of haematologic and renal toxicity 
was probably related to both S-1 and the lower dose of cisplatin used in the S-1 + cisplatin arm.  
The overall incidence of Grade > 3 adverse events was lower in the S-1 + cisplatin group than in the 
5-FU  +  cisplatin  group  in  terms  of  neutropenia,  leukopenia,  febrile  neutropenia,  stomatitis,  and 
mucosal inflammation. Grade 3-4 neutropenia (that worsened from baseline by at least one grade) was 
observed half as frequently in the S-1 + cisplatin group (32.3% of patients) as in the 5-FU + cisplatin 
group  (63.6%),  and  events  of  febrile  neutropenia  or  neutropenic  infection  were  significantly  lower  in 
the S-1 + cisplatin arm (5.0%) than in the 5-FU + cisplatin arm (14.4%). Deaths due to drug-related 
events indicative of myelosuppression were observed in 4 (0.8%) patients in  the S-1  + cisplatin arm 
compared to 14 (2.8%) patients in the 5-FU + cisplatin arm.  Overall, the frequency of toxic deaths in 
the  S-1  +  cisplatin  arm  (2.5%  of  patients)  was  approximately  half  that  of  the  5-FU  +  cisplatin  arm 
(4.9%  of  patients).  In  addition,  the  overall  incidence  of  Grade  3-4  stomatitis/mucosal  inflammation 
was  significantly  lower  in  the  S-1  +  cisplatin  group  compared  to  the  5-FU  +  cisplatin  group  (2.1% 
versus  21.5%).  There  was  no  difference  between  the  S-1  +  cisplatin  and  5-FU  +  cisplatin  treatment 
groups  with  respect  to  incidence  of  Grade  3-4  diarrhea  (4.8%,  S-1  +  cisplatin;  4.5%,  5-FU  + 
cisplatin).  As expected due to the lower dose of cisplatin in the S-1 + cisplatin arm, significantly fewer 
abnormalities  in  renal-related  laboratory  parameters,  such  as  elevated  serum  creatinine  and 
impairment of renal clearance, but also peripheral neuropathy, and alopecia were observed in the S-1 
+ cisplatin arm compared to the 5-FU + cisplatin arm.  
Events of palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia were reported more frequently in the S-1 + cisplatin arm 
than  in  the  5-FU  +  cisplatin  arm  (5.4%  versus  2.6%),  but  were  limited  to  Grade  1  or  2  severity  in 
almost all patients. Clinical laboratory findings of Grade 3-4 hyperbilirubinaemia were more frequent in 
the S-1 + cisplatin arm than in the 5-FU + cisplatin arm (6.5% vs 3.6%), but were not associated with 
parenchymal hepatotoxicity.

Post marketing experience 
The safety profile of Teysuno in a post-marketing safety surveillance study in Japan of 4177 patients 
treated  with  Teysuno,  as  monotherapy  or  in  combination  regimens,  for  advanced  gastric  cancer  was 
generally in line with the expected toxicity profile, with most frequently reported adverse events being 
leucocytopenia, anorexia, and nausea/vomiting. 
2.5.2.  Discussion and Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety database that establishes the foundation for this type II variation of S-1 (Teysuno, TS1) in 
combination with platinum-regimens in patients with advanced gastric cancer is based on around 600 
patients, the great majority of which (>98%) treated with the combination S1+ cisplatin. They include: 
-  the  interim  safety  results  of  the  phase  1,  open-label  dose-finding  TPU-S1119  study  where  S-1  was 
administered  in  combination  with  oxaliplatin  and  epirubicin  in  patients  with  advanced  solid  tumours 
(Cohort 1 and 2) and in 7 patients with esophagogastric cancer (cohort 3); 
-  the  article  reported  in  the  literature  (Chung  2011)  regarding  the  phase  I  TPU-S1109  trial,  where 
patients  with  advanced  solid  tumours  were  treated  in  USA  with  the  combination  S1-oxaliplatin-
bevacizumab, in a 3-weekly (Stage A) and in a 2-weekly (Stage B) schema; 
- the database provided/assessed during the original MAA in EU of S-1 in combination with cisplatin in 
patients with advanced gastric cancer.  
Of  note,  no  data  have  been  provided  regarding  the  combination  of  S-1  with  carboplatin,  another 
clinically used platinum-compound. 
The data regarding the toxicity of the combination S-1 + cisplatin are in line with the already  known 
safety database. The very limited data available over the combination Oxaliplatin-epirubicin-S1 and S-
1-Oxaliplatin-bevacizumab appear to suggest a safety profile of the combinations explored in line with 
the  drug  class  and  mechanism  of  action  and  with  baseline  characteristics  of  the  study  population 
(patients  with  solid  tumours  and  advanced  esophagogastric  cancer),  but  evaluation  could  be 
confounded  by  the  drug  specificic  toxicity  of  epirubicin  or  bevacizumab  and  by  the  small  safety 
database.  Although  no  pharmacokinetic  interactions  appear  to  be  observed  with  the  combination  S-1 
and Oxaliplatin in the studies presented, the paucity of data due to the very limited number of patients 
treated, the heterogeneity of S-1 dose administered and the short follow up do not allow a compelling 
evaluation of the safety profile of S-1 in combination with platinum compounds, other than cisplatin.

3. Benefit-risk balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The efficacy of S1 in combination with cisplatin has been adequately demonstrated in the pivotal phase 
III  (FLAGS)  study,  comparing  the  combination  S1  +  cisplatin  with  5FU  +  cisplatin  in  the  target 
population.  The  non-inferiority  of  the  combination  S1  +  cisplatin  versus  5FU  +  cisplatin  has  been 
assessed  during  the  original  submission  of  the  MAA  of  Teysuno  in  patients  with  advanced  gastric 
cancer leading to a positive CHMP opinion. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects  
Pharmacokinetics  data  regarding  potential  interaction  between  S1  +  oxaliplatin  +  epirubicin  have  not 
been provided. 
No  Clinical  Study  Report  has  been  provided  for  study  TPU-S1109  which  was  intended  to  support  the 
use of S1 in combination with oxaliplatin from a PK viewpoint. This hampers an adequate assessment 
of the claimed lack of pharmacokinetic interaction between S1 and oxaliplatin.  
The efficacy data in support of the combination S1-Oxaliplatin are based one phase I dose-finding TPU-
S1119  study  (where  the  combination  S1  +  oxaliplatin  +  epirubicin  was  evaluated  in  patients  with 
advanced  solid  tumors  (Cohort  1  and  2)  and  in  7  patients  with  advanced  esophagogastric  cancer 
previously  untreated  (cohort  3).  Supportive  literature  data  from  the  dose-finding  TPU-S1109  study 
exploring  the  combination  S1  +  oxaliplatin  +  bevacizumab  conducted  in  patients  with  advanced  solid 
tumors  have  been  provided.  Data  are  too  scarce  to  adequately  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  the  S1-
oxaliplatin combinations in the proposed target population.  
No  efficacy  data  have  been  provided  over  S1  in  combination  with  carboplatin  (another  clinically  used 
platinum compound). 
In  view  of  the  known  differences  in  pharmacological  characteristics,  mechanism  of  action,  dosing 
regimen  and  toxicity  between  the  platinum  compounds  available,  extrapolation  of  the  data  available 
over  efficacy  and  safety  of  S1-Cisplatin  to  other  platinum-based  combinations  is  not  considered 
appropriate. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety of S1 in combination with cisplatin has been adequately assessed, in comparison with 5FU + 
cisplatin, within the pivotal phase III (FLAGS) study performed in the target population. Safety profile 
of  S1  in  combination  with  cisplatin  was  considered  manageable  and  in  line  with  the  expected  safety

profile  of  both  drugs.  The  most  common  side  effects  are  anaemia,  neutropenia,  vomiting,  diarrhoea, 
abdominal  pain,  weight  decrease,  anorexia  and  fatigue.  The  most  common  severe  adverse  reactions 
were neutropenia, anaemia, and fatigue. 
The combination S1-cisplatin appeared to be better tolerated than 5FU-cisplatin, with lower incidence 
of  gastrointestinal  toxicity,  particularly  stomatitis  and  mucosal  inflammation,  probably  related  to  S1 
administration, and less haematologic and renal toxicity which were probably related to the lower dose 
of cisplatin used in the S1 + cisplatin study arm. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The  safety  data  in  support  of  the  combination  S1-Oxaliplatin  are  based  on  two  phase  I  dose-finding 
studies  (TPU-S1119  and  TPU-S1109)  where  the  combination  S1  +  oxaliplatin  +  epirubicin  and  S1  + 
oxaliplatin + bevacizumab, respectively, were evaluated in patients with advanced solid tumours.  Data 
are considered too scarce to adequately evaluate the toxicity of the S1-oxaliplatin combinations in the 
proposed target population.  
Patients  enrolled  in  the  TPU-S1119  study  were  required  to  have  adequate  left  ventricular  ejection 
fraction  at  baseline.  According  to  the  study  protocol,  Echocardiogram,  ECG  and  evaluation  of  cardiac 
enzymes  were  regularly  performed  in  patients  enrolled  in  the  study.  The  MAH  should  clarify  whether 
reductions of left ventricular ejection fraction or other cardiac adverse events/significant abnormalities 
were  observed  in  the  patients  treated  and  whether  such  findings  should  result  into  inclusion  of  a 
warning over this issue in the SmPC. 
No  safety  data  have  been  provided  over  S-1  in  combination  with  carboplatin  (another  clinically  used 
platinum compound). 
Benefit-risk balance 
The  positive  benefit/risk  ratio  of  the  combination  S1-cisplatin  in  the  target  population  has  been 
adequately  demonstrated  within  the  original  MAA  for  S1  (Teysuno®),  leading  to  a  positive  CHMP 
opinion.  
No  data  have  been  provided  regarding  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  S1  in  combination  with  carboplatin, 
another  clinically  used  platinum-compound,  in  the  target  population.  Although  no  pharmacokinetic 
interactions  have  been  reported  regarding  the  combination  of  S-1  and  oxaliplatin  in  the  small 
Caucasian studies reported, data available at this time are too scarce to allow a compelling evaluation 
of  the  benefit/risk  ratio  of  S1+platinum-combination  regimens  other  than  cisplatin  in  the  proposed 
target  population.  No  PK  data  have  been  provided  regarding  potential  PK  interactions  between  S1, 
oxaliplatin and epirubicin. 
In  view  of  the  different  pharmacological  characteristics,  mechanism  of  action,  dosing  regimen  and 
toxicity of the different platinum compounds available to date (cisplatin, oxaliplatin, carboplatin), clear 
demonstration  should  be  provided  that  the  use  of  platinum  compounds  other  than  cisplatin,  in 
combination  with  S1,  will  not  affect  efficacy  and  safety  of  the  combination  and  therefore  the 
benefit/risk  ratio  in  the  proposed  target  population.  Indeed,  extrapolation    of  the  known  efficacy  and 
safety results of 5FU/capecitabine in combination with platinum regimens in the target population to S-
1 is not considered appropriate.

4. Recommendations 
The  type  II  variation  in  order  to  change  the  wording  of  indication  of  Teysuno  for  the  treatment  of 
patients  with  advanced  gastric  cancer  in  “combination  with  platinum  regimens”,  instead  of  “in 
combination  with  cisplatin”  as  stated  by  the  currently  approved  indication,  is  not  approvable  since 
major  objections  and  other  concerns  have  been  identified,  which  preclude  a  recommendation  at  the 
present time.  The details of these major objections and other concerns are provided in Annex 1  (RSI 
1) and should be addressed in writing. 
5. Request for Supplementary Information

Major objections 
Other concerns 
Environmental Risk Assessment: 
1.  The  applicant  is  asked  to  provide  suitable  information  to  verify  that  an  increase  in 
environmental  exposure  of  the  active  ingredient  is  not  to  be  expected.    If  acceptable 
information  cannot  be  provided,  the  applicant  is  asked  to  submit  an  updated  /  revised 
environmental  risk  assessment  according  to  the  guideline  on  the  environmental  risk 
assessment of medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00, June 2006). 
2. Clinical Aspects  
2.1 Efficacy and Safety 
Major Objections 
2.  Data  available  at  this  time  are  too  scarce  to  allow  a  compelling  evaluation  of  the  benefit/risk 
ratio  of  S1  in  combination  with  platinum-based  combinations  other  than  cisplatin  in  the 
proposed target population. Very limited data are available over the combination Oxaliplatin-S1 
and no data have been provided over the combination carboplatin-S1. In view of the different 
pharmacological  characteristics,  mechanism  of  action,  dosing  regimen  and  toxicity  of  the 
different  platinum  compounds  available  to  date  (cisplatin,  oxaliplatin,  carboplatin),  clear 
demonstration should be provided that the use of platinum compounds other than cisplatin, in 
combination  with  S1  will  not  affect  efficacy  and  safety  of  the  combination  and  therefore  the 
benefit/risk ratio in the proposed target population. 
Other concerns 
3.  Pharmacokinetic  characteristics  of  the  three  platinum  compounds  are  not  identical  and 
moreover  the  dosing  regimen  (dose  and  frequency)  is  different.  Therefore,  the  applicant  is 
requested to submit data supporting the various combinations with S-1. 
4.  The MAH is requested to submit the study report of trial TPU-S1109. 
5.  Patients  enrolled  in  the  TPU-S1119  study  were  required  to  have  adequate  left  ventricular 
ejection  fraction  at  baseline.  According  to  the  study  protocol,  Echocardiogram,  ECG  and

evaluation of cardiac enzymes were regularly performed in patients enrolled in the study. The 
MAH  should  clarify  whether  reductions  of  left  ventricular  ejection  fraction  or  other  cardiac 
adverse  events/significant  abnormalities  were  observed  in  the  patients  treated  and  whether 
such findings should result to inclusion of a warning over this issue in the SmPC. 
2.3 RMP 
Major Objections 
Other concerns 
6.  The term “platinum-based regimens” is considered too generic as this implies that it would also 
include  carboplatin  based  regimens.  The  MAH  should  make  it  clear  throughout  the  RMP  that 
treatment with Teysuno only includes cisplatin or oxaliplatin. 
7.  In  the  RMP  information  from  the  published  phase  III  study  (Higushi  et.  al)  is used  to  classify 
and  describe  several  safety  concerns.  However,  the  full  article,  or  any  other  reports  detailing 
the study and the results could not be located in the submission. The MAH should provide this. 
8.  It  would  seem  that  the  data  on  combination  Teysuno  +  oxaliplatin  is  from  mostly  Asians  and 
only few Caucasians. This could be considered a limitation as there are some racial differences  
between de Asian and Caucasian population (metabolism) that could have an influence on the 
extrapolation  of  the  safety  data  and  could  have  an  effect  on  the  RMP.  The  MAH  should 
comment. 
9.  It  is  noted  that  patients  enrolled  in  study  S1119  were  required  to  have  adequate  left 
ventricular  ejection  fraction  at  baseline.  Echocardiogram,  ECG  and  evaluation  of  cardiac 
enzymes were regularly performed in patients enrolled in the study. In the Clinical AR for this 
variation a clarification on this is requested. The MAH should discuss whether this information 
from study S1119 has an impact on the RMP as well.  
10. In  Part  II  Module  SIV  and  Module  SVII  of  the  RMP  very  little  information  is  included  on  the 
proposed combination of Teysuno and oxaliplatin. In Module SVII.3 mostly only the frequency 
is  added,  but  other  paragraphs  in  the  tables  have  not  been  amended  and  thus  only  reflect 
information for the combination with cisplatin. The MAH should update the RMP to include more 
detailed information, or should better reflect the fact that only limited information is available 
for the combination with oxaliplatin. 
11. In  the  RMP  it  is  stated  that  in  the  Phase  III  study  8.6%  of  the  patients  treated  with 
experienced  increased  blood  creatinine.  Information  should  be  provided  by  the  MAH  on 
whether any other AEs suggestive of renal toxicity were reported in the Higuchi study besides 
blood 
creatinine 
increased.  
Even though it is shown in Table 16 of the RMP that increased blood creatinine was reported in 
substantial more patients receiving the combination with cisplatin (38.8%), it would seem that 
the  combination  with  oxaliplatin  might  have  an  effect  on  renal  function  as  well.  The  MAH 
should comment. 
12. In the RMP ‘hearing impairment’ is mentioned by the MAH as an identified risk specifically for 
the  treatment  with  cisplatin.  Hearing  impairment  is,  however,  also  associated  with  oxaliplatin 
(SmPC  lists  ‘ototoxicity’,  ‘deafness’).  Also,  for  oxaliplatin  (and  cisplatin)  neurotoxicity  is  a 
known risk. No mention is made in the RMP on this possible complication with oxaliplatin. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/641866/2014 
Page 27/28 
 
 
 
  
 
 
MAH  should  discuss  whether  information  on  hearing  impairment  and  neurotoxicity  for  the 
combination therapy with oxaliplatin should be added to Module SVII.3 of RMP as risks for the 
combination therapy. 
13. The Public Summary should be written with a lay audience in mind. In the Public Summary as 
presented  by  the  MAH  several  medical/scientific  terms  are  included  that  might  not  be  readily 
understood.  Only  after  an  explanation  has  been  provided  of  these  terms  can  they  be  used 
throughout the Public Summary. For instance, the sentence “A fluoropyrimidine and a platinum 
salt  are  commonly  used  and  may  be  associated  with  an  anthracycline  or  a  taxane”  in  Part  VI 
section  2.1  is  considered  too  difficult  without  clarification.  The  MAH  is  requested  to  review 
sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4.

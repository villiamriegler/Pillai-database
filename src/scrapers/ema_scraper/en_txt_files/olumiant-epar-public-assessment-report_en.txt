1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. submitted on 22 January 2016 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Olumiant, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 3 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the 
centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 25 September 2014. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Olumiant is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adult 
patients who are naïve to, have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to disease-modifying anti-
rheumatic drugs (including conventional or biologic DMARDs). Olumiant may be used as monotherapy or in 
combination with non-biologic DMARDs. 
Olumiant has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to 
improve physical function. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application.  
The applicant indicated that baricitinib was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical and 
clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting 
certain tests or studies. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0069/2013 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). At the time of submission of the 
application, the PIP P/0069/2013 was not yet completed as some measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to 
the proposed indication. 
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 9/132 
  
  
  
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance baricitinib contained in the above medicinal product to be 
considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a medicinal 
product previously authorised within the European Union.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Olumiant is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients 
who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic 
drugs. Olumiant may be used as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
The prevalence of RA is in the order of 0.5-1% of the population. It occurs about two to three times more 
commonly in women than in men, although this gender difference disappears in later life. Onset is maximal in 
the fifth-sixth decades. 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation 
Rheumatoid arthritis is characterised by chronic systemic inflammation that primarily affects diarthrodia 
joints, but can affect other organ systems. The disease has variable expression and outcome ranging from 
mild, limited disease to severe systemic disease associated with progressive joint destruction, significantly 
compromised quality of life, and reduced survival (Smolen and Steiner 2003; Colmegna et al. 2012). Patients 
with mild, limited RA usually have minimal joint destruction. Patients with moderately to severely active 
disease have persistent systemic inflammation with elevated acute phase proteins and pro-inflammatory 
cytokines contributing to symptoms of fatigue, pain, joint stiffness, and associated comorbidities of 
cardiovascular disease, infections, mental health disorders, and malignancies (CDC 2015). Within the joint, 
inflammation directly affects the synovial membrane and bone resulting in damage to the bone and articular 
cartilage. Importantly, while signs and symptoms are reversible with appropriate treatment, joint damage 
and the associated disability are permanent.  
2.1.4.  Management 
Pharmaceutical treatment options in moderate-severe RA include conventional small molecule Disease 
Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (cDMARDs), and biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs). In addition, symptomatic 
treatment with conventional NSAIDs or selective COX-2 inhibitors is often required.  
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 11/132 
  
  
  
Conventional small-molecule DMARDs include, amongst others, methotrexate, leflunomide, sulfasalazine, and 
hydroxychloroquine. Biologic DMARDs that are registered in Europe for the treatment of RA include Tumour 
Necrosis Factor inhibitors (TNF-I) adalimumab, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, and certolizumab pegol, 
Interleukin-6 inhibitor tocilizumab, B-cell depletion therapy rituximab, T-cell co-stimulation modulator 
abatacept, and Interleukin-1 antagonist anakinra. The latter is not much used anymore in modern 
rheumatology practice.  
In DMARD-naive patients, the initial choice of DMARD is commonly methotrexate (MTX), used as 
monotherapy or in combination with other cDMARDs and/or low doses of corticosteroids. Tolerability issues 
are well-described for MTX; approximately 40% of patients receiving MTX experience gastrointestinal 
symptoms (nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, while hepatotoxicity is observed frequently and pulmonary 
toxicity is observed occasionally. Patients responding insufficiently to MTX or other cDMARDs commonly begin 
treatment with a bDMARD along with MTX. 
Therapeutic strategies employing more intensive intervention with DMARDs in early disease phase, often 
using combinations of non-biologic and biologic DMARDs, have shown a faster onset of action and more 
profound clinical responses than traditional step-up approaches. As recommended by the EULAR (European 
League against Rheumatism), treat-to-target strategies are now employed, meaning that the treatment goal 
is Remission, or at least Low Disease Activity (LDA) in advanced patients (see outline EULAR 
recommendations, Smolen JS, Landewé R, Breedveld FC, et al. Ann Rheum Dis doi:10.1136/annrheumdis-
2013-204573, see also figure below). Until the desired treatment target is reached, drug therapy should be 
adjusted at least every 3 to 6 months. 
Even with the most effective treatments available, such as bDMARDs, more than half of patients do not 
achieve a substantial response defined as achievement of low disease activity (Rubbert-Roth and Finckh 
2009; Villeneuve and Haraoui 2010). In addition, some patients treated with bDMARDS may lose efficacy due 
to the development of anti-drug antibodies. The risk of bDMARDs include injection or infusion site reactions, 
increased frequency of infections, reactivation of tuberculosis or viral infections, pneumonia, gastrointestinal 
perforations, other autoimmune conditions, and -possibly- an increased incidence of malignancy.  
In conclusion, despite the availability of a number of agents for the treatment of RA with various methods of 
action,  many  patients  fail  to  respond  to  initial  treatment,  do  not  tolerate  treatment,  or  lose  response  over 
time. For patients with an inadequate response to cDMARDs, only parenteral biological DMARDs are available 
thus far. Thus, there is a need for alternative oral treatment options.

About the product 
Baricitinib (Olumiant) is a Janus Kinase inhibitor with selectivity for JAK2 and JAK1, and less potency for JAK3 
or TYK2. The JAKs and their associated signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) are the 
major intracellular pathway that controls the magnitude and duration of signalling for cytokines that bind to 
Type I and Type II cytokine receptors. These receptors lack intrinsic enzymatic activity capable of mediating 
signal transduction; so receptor-associated STATs are instead phosphorylated by JAKs, resulting in STAT 
activation. Activated STATs are active transcription factors and drive the expression of multiple genes 
important for cell activation, localisation, survival, and proliferation. Several of the pro-inflammatory 
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of RA, including IL-6, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating 
factor (GM-CSF), and interferons signal via the JAK-STAT pathway. Thus, inhibition of JAK1 and JAK2 
signalling targets multiple RA-associated cytokine pathways, and thereby may reduce inflammation, cellular 
activation, and proliferation of key immune cells. 
Baricitinib has a low potency for JAK3. JAK3 may be more associated with the common gamma chain 
receptor, than the other JAKS. The common gamma chain cytokines include IL-15 and IL-21, which regulate 
lymphocyte activation, function, and proliferation.  
The originally proposed indication was:  
“Olumiant is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients 
who are naïve to, have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic 
drugs (including conventional synthetic or biologic DMARDs). Olumiant may be used as monotherapy or in 
combination with conventional synthetic DMARDs. 
Olumiant has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray.” 
The approved indication is: 
“Olumiant is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients 
who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic 
drugs. Olumiant may be used as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate (see sections 4.4, 4.5 
and 5.1 for available data on different combinations).” 
The recommended dose of Olumiant is 4 mg once daily. A dose of 2 mg once daily is appropriate for patients 
such as those aged ≥75 years and may be appropriate for patients with a history of chronic or recurrent 
infections. A dose of 2 mg once daily may also be considered for patients who have achieved sustained 
control of disease activity with 4 mg once daily and are eligible for dose tapering. 
Treatment should not be initiated in patients with an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) less than 
0.5 x 109 cells/L, an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 1 x 109 cells/L, or who have a haemoglobin 
value less than 8 g/dL. Treatment may be initiated once values have improved above these limits. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
Legal basis: Article 8 (3), Directive 2001/83/EC, full application. 
Scientific Advice obtained from the CHMP in November 2011 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/868023/2011) and in June 
2014 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/343853/2014).  
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 14/132 
  
  
  
The clinical advice sought was primarily related to the design of the studies in support of indications in 
different RA sub-populations (first line in DMARD-naïve patients, and second line in MTX-IR patients and 
bDMARD-IR patients).  
In general, the proposed design for a 52-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled 
study in DMARD-naïve patients was supported by the SAWP. ACR20 response rate at Week 12 was proposed 
as the primary efficacy endpoint. The CHMP agreed with the design and endpoints, but noted that comparison 
with MTX beyond 12 weeks could be also included in the list of key endpoints. The primary endpoint was 
adapted to 24 weeks based on this advice. In addition, the CHMP considered that based on safety grounds, 
further restriction of the patient population might become necessary at the time of MAA.  
There were a few deviations from the study plans that were provided for the Scientific Advice in 2011.  
CHMP also pointed out recent approvals at the time for Cimzia, Simponi and Orencia which had used co-
primary endpoints on the improvement of physical function and/or prevention of structural damage to include 
such claims in the label. However, the draft EMA guideline on RA and the EMA guideline on the SmPC points 
out that separate endpoints like structural damage and function are not considered as separate claims in the 
indication. 
In relation to the second-line indication of RA patients who have had an insufficient response or intolerance to 
previous therapy with 1 or more cDMARDs (including MTX), a 52-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo- 
and active-controlled (with a TNF-I) trial was proposed.  
The Applicant requested Scientific Advice in November 2011 before the revision process of the current RA 
Guideline had been initiated. In the draft guideline of 2015, different primary endpoints than ACR20 are 
proposed (see discussion B/R section).  
Overall,  the  Applicant  implemented  the  SAWP/CHMP  advice  adequately.  Several  changes  were  made  in  the 
design  of  the  trials  afterwards,  without  consulting  the  SAWP.  E.g.  in  contrast  to  the  original  proposal,  no 
placebo  was  included  in  the  study  on  the  “first-line’  indication  in  DMARD-naïve  patients,  for  ethical 
considerations. This hampers the assessment of assay sensitivity. Retrospectively, assay sensitivity could be 
assumed in this study as the response to baricitinib 4 mg deviated from active control MTX. The omission of 
the placebo comparator may therefore be acceptable. See comments under Clinical Efficacy and the Benefit-
Risk assessment.  
Furthermore, no active comparator has been included in the study in bDMARD-inadequate responders, for 
practical considerations as the alternative treatment options required IV infusion and prior treatment of 
corticosteroids to avoid infusion reactions. As an active comparator –TNF-inhibitor adalimumab- has been 
included in another study in RA patients irresponsive to MTX alone, this may provide sufficient information 
regarding the position of baricitinib towards bDMARDs.

The product is available in polyvinylchloride/polyethylene/polychlorotrifluoroethylene - aluminium blisters and 
polyvinylchloride/aluminium/oriented polyamide - aluminium perforated unit dose blisters as described in 
section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of baricitinib is 2-(3-(4-(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-1-
(ethylsulfonyl)azetidin-3-yl)acetonitrile corresponding to the molecular formula C16H17N7O2S. It has a 
relative molecular mass of 371.42 and has the following structure: 
Figure 2.  Structural formula of baricitinib 
The structure of baricitinib was confirmed using a combination of mass spectrometry, FTIR spectroscopy, 
Raman spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectroscopy, DSC, X-ray crystallography and 
elemental analysis. 
The active substance is a non-hygroscopic, white to practically white to light pink powder, slightly soluble in 
0.1 N HCl and practically insoluble in water. It is very slightly soluble in ethanol and sparingly soluble in 
acetone and tetrahydrofuran. It is classified as a BCS Class III substance.  
Baricitinib has a non-chiral molecular structure. 
Several crystalline forms of baricitinib free base were observed during a comprehensive polymorph screen. 
Crystalline form I of baricitinib free base, a thermodynamically stable anhydrous form, was selected for 
commercial development.

Page 16/132 
  
  
  
 
 
Baricitinib is considered to be a new active substance. The applicant demonstrated that neither it, nor its 
derivatives and salts have ever been active substances in products authorised in Europe. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
A single manufacturer carries out the entire process. Baricitinib is synthesized using a convergent synthesis, 
consisting of three sequential coupling reactions of the starting materials, with requisite protection and 
deprotection steps to ensure proper connectivity. The final step involves a deprotection reaction to form the 
active substance. Designation of the staring materials is in line with the scientific advice sought from the 
CHMP prior to submission of the dossier. Additional data requested at the time of the scientific advice 
procedure has been provided and it was considered acceptable. 
The  development  of  the  manufacturing  process  for  baricitinib  included  the  use  of  Quality  by  Design  (QbD) 
principles  and  linking  of  elements  of  risk  and  risk  management  to  scientific  understanding.  Prior  process 
knowledge  and  a  combination  of  conventional  univariate  and  bracketing  studies,  multivariate  studies  and 
statistical models were the basis of the proposed PARs and design spaces for three unit operations. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of active substances. A comprehensive discussion on potential and actual impurities is provided, 
including process impurities, genotoxic impurities and fate and purge studies. Impurities have been evaluated 
using a combination of in silico toxicity predictions, visual alerts, external databases, and in vitro 
assessments as needed. These evaluations took into account all starting materials, intermediates, reagents, 
reaction conditions in the route as well as potential impurities and degradation products. The evaluation of 
genotoxic impurities utilized an assessment for alerting structures as well as in silico toxicity predictions  in 
compliance with ICH M7 guidance. In silico toxicity assessments flagged several impurities as positive and 
two impurities analysed were positive in the Ames test. Genotoxic impurities are controlled below the TTC. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development program. It includes three minor changes from the process used to manufacture batches for 
primary stability studies and clinical trials (including Phase 3 trials). Changes introduced have been presented 
in sufficient detail and have been justified. The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of 
the development is considered to be comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
The active substance is packaged in a linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) primary liner which complies 
with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. The liner contains an additive that provides 
antistatic protection. The LLDPE liner is placed in a laminated foil liner and may be placed in an appropriate 
container such as a corrugated container, fibre drum, polyethylene drum or metal drum. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for identity (IR or Raman), crystal form (XRPD), assay 
(HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), palladium (ICP-MS), description (visual), particle size 
distribution (laser light diffraction), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.) and 
microbiological testing (Ph. Eur.). 
The active substance specifications are based on the active substance critical quality attributes (CQA). The 
CQAs identified are identity, potency, purity and particle size. 
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 17/132 
  
  
  
The omission of tests for elemental impurities (except palladium) has been justified based on the risk-
assessment performed in line with ICH Q3D and batch analysis data.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Analysis data from 29 commercial and pilot scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results 
are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of the active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 24 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% 
RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines 
were provided. Supportive stability data were also provided from a pilot scale and a commercial scale batch 
using earlier development processes for up to 48 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months at 40 ºC 
/ 75% RH, respectively. 
The following parameters were tested: identity (IR), crystal form, assay, impurities, description, package 
characteristics, particle size distribution and loss on drying. The analytical methods used were the same as 
for release and were stability indicating. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications. No significant changes or trends were observed in any of 
the parameters tested through 24 months and 6 months of storage at 25 °C / 60% RH and 40 °C / 75% RH, 
respectively, compared to the initial values. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. The study confirmed that 
baricitinib is not sensitive to light. 
Data following exposure to the following stressed conditions were provided for the active substance in the 
solid state: heat, light, heat and humidity. Data was also provided for the active substance in a solution or a 
suspension: under a wide range of pH conditions at elevated temperatures, light, oxidative conditions and the 
presence of radical initiator and metal salts. 
Baricitinib active substance in solid state did not exhibit any detectable degradation under the stressed 
conditions of heat, heat and humidity, or simulated sunlight. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months with no special storage conditions 
in the proposed container, LLDPE primary liner. The LLDPE liner is placed in a laminated foil liner and may be 
placed in an appropriate container such as a corrugated container, fibre drum, polyethylene drum or metal 
drum.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as immediate release film-coated tablets. The 2 mg strength is a light pink, 
oblong tablet, 9.0 mm by 7.5 mm in size and debossed with “Lilly” on one side and “2” on the other. The 4 
mg strength is a medium pink, round tablet, 8.5 mm in diameter and debossed with “Lilly” on one side and 
“4” on the other. The different strengths of the film-coated tablets are distinguishable by their colour, shape, 
size, and debossing. 
Pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. 
The critical quality attributes identified were description, identification, potency, purity, content uniformity, 
and release throughout the finished product shelf-life. 
The formulation and manufacturing development were evaluated through the use of risk assessment and 
laboratory experiments to identify the product critical quality attributes and critical process parameters. A 
risk analysis was performed using the failure mode effect and criticality analysis (FMECA) method in order to 
define critical process steps and process parameters that may have an influence on the finished product 
quality attributes. The risk identification was based on the prior knowledge of products with similar 
formulations and manufacturing processes as well as on the experience from formulation development, 
process design and scale-up studies. The critical process parameters have been adequately identified. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards or the EU legislation. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The 
list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.2.1 of this report. Excipient 
compatibility studies, prior experience from other roller compaction projects, and scientific knowledge were 
utilized to select tablet excipients with appropriate functionality to manufacture an acceptable finished 
product. The good compatibility was further demonstrated with stability data as no degradation products 
were observed with commercial tablet formulations placed on stability through 6 months of accelerated and 
24 months of long-term conditions. 
An overview of the formulations used to support Phase 1, 2 and 3 trials has been provided. The commercial 
finished product formulation and manufacturing process were used throughout the Phase 3 clinical program 
and for the primary stability program. The in vivo equivalence of the 4 mg commercial tablet and the 4 mg 
Phase 2 tablet was confirmed in a relative bioavailability study. 
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. 
The primary packaging is polyvinylchloride/polyethylene/polychlorotrifluoroethylene - aluminium blisters and 
polyvinylchloride/aluminium/oriented polyamide - aluminium perforated unit dose blisters. The material 
complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated 
by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  seven  main  steps:  blending  steps,  roller  compaction,  sizing,  final 
blending,  tablet  compression,  film-coating  and  packaging  steps.  The  process  is  considered  to  be  a  non-
standard manufacturing process due to the low active substance content in the finished product. 
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 19/132 
  
  
  
Major  steps of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated by  a  number  of  studies.  Validation  data  was 
provided  for  2  consecutive  and  1  additional  commercial  scale  batch  for  2  mg  film-coated  tablets  and  3 
consecutive commercial scale batches for 4 mg film-coated tablets and were found acceptable by the CHMP. 
It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  capable  of  producing  the  finished  product  of 
intended  quality  in  a  reproducible  manner.  The  in-process  controls  are  adequate  for  this  type  of 
manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Proven acceptable ranges have been established based on multivariate. The available development data, the 
proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed 
PARs. 
Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form:  identity 
(IR),  assay  (HPLC),  degradation  products  (HPLC),  description  (visual),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (HPLC), 
dissolution (HPLC), dye identity (chemical reaction). 
The omission of several tests from the finished product specifications has been appropriately justified. 
Dimensions of the tablets are controlled by the process parameters (tooling) and a test is therefore not 
required in the specifications of the finished product as part of the visual description test. The omission of 
tests for elemental impurities has been justified based on the risk-assessment performed in line with ICH 
Q3D and batch analysis data. Omission of moisture (water content) has been justified based on the type of 
the manufacturing process (dry roller compaction and the removal of water at the end of the coating process) 
and stability data. Microbial testing was omitted based on batch analysis data and adequate controls for 
manufacturing, components of the finished product and packaging. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 44 commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. Supportive batch 
analysis results of 78 batches of different sizes of earlier development formulations were also provided. 
The finished product is released on to the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
A matrix design for all strengths and packaging for the long-term storage conditions is proposed. The testing 
schedule employed a “one third reduction” i. e. 2 out of 3 batches of each strength were tested at the 3, 6, 9, 
and 12 month time points. All batches were tested at 18, 24, and 36 months. For accelerated conditions, the 
reduction  concerns  the  number  of  batches  and  type  of  packaging  tested  at the  1  and  3  month  time  points, 
i.e. 1 or 2 batches per strength and packaging configuration were tested at each time point. All batches and 
packaging  configurations  were  tested  at  the  initial  and  6  month  time  point.  The  reduction  in  the  design  is 
proposed based on the similarity of the composition and manufacturing process of the tablets, physical and 
chemical  stability  data  exhibited  during  development  and  clinical  stability  studies,  and  it  was  found  to  be 
acceptable. 
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 20/132 
  
  
  
Stability  data  from  3  commercial  scale  batches  of  each  strength  of  the  film-coated  tablets  packaged  in  the 
polyvinylchloride/polyethylene/polychlorotrifluoroethylene  -  aluminium  blister  packs  stored  under  long  term 
conditions  for  up  to  24  months  at  30  ºC  /  65%  RH  and  for  up to  6 months under  accelerated  conditions  at 
40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
Stability  data  from  3  commercial  scale  batches  of  each  strength  of  the  film-coated  tablets  packaged  in  the 
polyvinylchloride/aluminium/oriented polyamide - aluminium blister packs stored under long term conditions 
for 24 months at 30 ºC / 75% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH 
according to the ICH guidelines were also provided. 
The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing. 
Additional  supportive  stability  data  from  six  batches  of  the  finished  product  manufactured  by  a  process 
representative of the commercial process that were used in the clinical trials and data on the finished product 
packaged in the 3 different bottle presentations was provided.  
Samples  were  tested  for  physical  appearance,  package  characteristics,  assay,  impurities,  dissolution,  water 
activity and microbial quality. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
No  significant  changes  to  any  parameters  were  observed  and  results  remained  within  the  proposed 
specifications under both long term and accelerated testing conditions. 
Stress testing studies were conducted on the finished product in order to gain an understanding of the 
degradation chemistry of baricitinib when formulated as a solid oral product. Both strengths of baricitinib 
film-coated tablets were stressed. A minor increase in impurity levels was noticed. The low levels of 
degradation products detected in the stress testing study of the finished product suggest that it is anticipated 
to demonstrate good stability under typical storage conditions. 
In  addition,  a  commercial  scale  batch  of  each  tablet  strength  was  exposed  to  light  as  defined  in  the  ICH 
Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. The results showed no significant 
change to any of the measured parameters and the finished product is thus considered photostable. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months with no special storage conditions, as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and finished product and 
their manufacturing processes. Design spaces have been proposed for three steps in the manufacture of the 
active substance and have been adequately verified. Only PARs are claimed for the finished product 
manufacturing process. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Pivotal safety pharmacology and toxicology studies were performed in compliance with GLP.   
Scientific advice was obtained from the CHMP in November 2011 and June 2014. In 2011, the non-clinical 
package was considered in general appropriate, with as point of attention that the safety margin in the 
chronic studies in dogs can be regarded as very low. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In enzyme inhibition assays, baricitinib demonstrated selective and balanced potency against JAK 1 (IC50 5.9 
nM)  and  JAK2  (5.7  nM)  with  less  potency  for  TYK2  (53  nM)  and  far  less  potency  for  JAK3  (>400  nM). 
Baricitinib  inhibited  the  phosphorylation  of  JAK2,  STAT3  and  STAT5  in  activated  PBMCs,  which  were 
stimulated  by  IL-2.  Also,  baricitinib  inhibited  IL-2  induced  T  cell  proliferation  with  an  IC50  of  29  nM, 
indicating the inhibition of JAK1 and the JAK/STAT3/5 pathway by baricitinib. 
Functional  inhibition  of  the  JAK-STAT  pathway  has  been  demonstrated in  multiple  cell-based  assay  systems 
using  physiologically  relevant  immune  activators.  In  human  IL-23  stimulated T  cells  baricitinib  inhibited  the 
JAK/STAT pathway by inhibiting both phosphorylation of STAT3 and production of the cytokines IL-17 and IL-
22, with IC50s of 20-57 nM. Baricitinib also inhibited the JAK/STAT pathway in response to IL-12 stimulation 
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 22/132 
  
  
  
by  inhibiting  STAT3  phosphorilation  (IC50  =  60  nM)  and  production  of  IFN-γ  in  human  T  cells  (IC50  =  5.8 
µM).  In  PBMCs,  baricitinib  inhibited  the  JAK/STAT  pathway  in  response  to  IL-6  stimulation,  resulting  in 
decreased  MCP-1  production.  Baricitinib  blocked  IL-6  induced  STAT3  phosphorylation  in  whole  blood  from 
humans, dogs and rats, with IC50 of 104, 49 and 128 nM respectively, confirming the species cross-reactivity 
of  the  compound.  Also,  ex  vivo  IL-6  stimulation  of  blood  samples  from  the  4-week  beagle  dog  toxicology 
study  demonstrated  that  all  dose  levels  were  pharmacologically  active,  exhibiting  inhibition  of  STAT3 
phosphorylation that was dose- and time- dependent. 
Baricitinib  improved  clinical  and  histological  signs  in  several  rodent  arthritic  related  models  of  disease  in  a 
dose dependent manner. In a mouse delayed type hypersensitivity model, the animals were sensitized with 
dinitrofluorobenzene  and  then  challenged  with  the  same  on  the  ear.  Baricitinib  at  10  mg/kg  twice  daily 
reduced  significantly  the  magnitude  of  the  swelling  by  48%,  suggesting  that  baricitinib  is  able  to  inhibit 
delayed type hypersensitivity cellular responses which may contribute to the overall efficacy observed in the 
rodent models which reflect certain aspects of rheumatoid arthritis. 
In the murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model, oral baricitinib ≥3 mg/kg bid showed efficacy which may 
be dependent on the impact of both T and B cell function by modulating the signalling of cytokines involved in 
the adaptive immune response. In a murine anti-collagen antibody induced arthritis model, baricitinib at 10 
mg/kg  bid  improved  clinical  and  histological  signs  without  inhibiting  the  generation  of  autoantibodies  and 
without a detectable reduction in peripheral leukocyte or erythroid cellular components. 
In a rat adjuvant arthritis (rAIA) model, baricitinib (IV, 1 – 6 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks) reduced inflammation 
50  –  100%  as  measured  by  redness  and  swelling  of  the  paws,  and  histological  comparison.  Plasma  levels 
were 53 – 480 nM, which compares well with the IC50 of 128 nM in the IL-6 induced STAT3 phosphorylation 
rat  whole  blood  assay.  In  a  similar  model  with  oral  dosing  of  3  and  10  mg/kg/day  baricitinib,  clinical  and 
histological signs were reduced by 39-82% at predicted AUC-values of 2 – 6.7 µM.h. Also in the rAIA model, 
oral baricitinib 10 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks reduces elevated cytokine mRNA levels from lymph nodes. 
While greater than 90% inhibition of IL-6 induced STAT3 phosphorylation was observed at the 3 and 10 
mg/kg doses at 1 hour in the rAIA model, only modest inhibition (13%), was observed at 3 mg/kg by 4 
hours, and by 24 hours, no inhibition was detected at any of the doses. These data demonstrate that 
baricitinib is efficacious in a preclinical model relevant to RA without requiring complete or continuous 
inhibition of JAK/STAT signalling. The inhibition is reversible, as it is less at 4 hours post dose and no longer 
apparent by 24 hours. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Baricitinib  was  screened  for  binding  to  a  panel  of  kinases,  and  in  addition  to  JAK1  and  JAK2,  baricitinib 
showed  moderate  binding  affinity  for  CaMK2d  and  CaMK2g  (IC50:170  nM  and  150  nM,  respectively).  The 
relevance  of  binding  to  these  kinases  at  the  doses  studied  in  humans  is  unknown,  but  the  values  are 
relatively high compared to the expected human free fraction Cmax of ca. 70 nM. Baricitinib did not show any 
additional significant binding to 250 other kinases. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Baricitinib  inhibited  the  hERG  channel  at  a  concentration  1400x  the  unbound  Cmax  at  MRHD.  In  dog, 
baricitinib  slightly  increased  heart  rate  and  decreased  systolic,  diastolic  and  arterial  blood  pressure,  with  a 
safety factor of 1.2 fold the MRHD.  
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 23/132 
  
  
  
Baricitinib induced effects on the CNS and respiratory system which were observed at relatively high 
exposures of 17-80 fold exposure at the MRHD. Effects observed included red flush of the skin and mucous 
membranes, drooping eyelids, absence of pupillary response, decreases in body temperature and a lower 
respiratory frequency. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Only human studies were conducted to examine pharmacodynamic drug interactions. Please see Clinical 
section of the report. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  nonclinical  absorption,  distribution,  metabolism  and  excretion  (ADME)  studies  have  been  conducted  in 
the same species and generally in the same strains as used in the toxicology studies. The pharmacokinetics 
(PK)  of  baricitinib  has  been  investigated  upon  single  dose  intravenous  (IV)  or  oral  (PO)  administration  in 
mouse, rat, dog and monkey. Multiple dose toxicokinetics (TK) was examined upon daily oral administration, 
which is the intended clinical route, in the CD-1 mouse, Tg-rasH2 mouse,  Sprague Dawley (SD) rat, beagle 
dog and (pregnant) rabbit. The formulations used in the disposition studies were generally the same as those 
used in the pivotal toxicity studies although radiolabelled drug was incorporated when appropriate. 
The Applicant provided validation reports for the analytical methods used, demonstrating the suitability of the 
methods,  storage  and  handling  for the  purpose  of  analysis  of  baricitinib.  Specific  and  sensitive  bioanalytical 
assays  have  been  developed  and  validated  for  the  quantitative  determination  of  baricitinib  in  mouse,  rat, 
rabbit and dog plasma. 
Baricitinib  is  a  lipophilic  compound  (Mw  371.4),  with  very  low  solubility  in  aqueous  solutions  at  neutral  pH. 
The  intended  clinical  route  of  baricitinib  is by  PO  administration,  which  was  also  the  route  of  administration 
for the pivotal toxicity studies. Several oral single dose studies were discussed to evaluate the absorption and 
pharmacokinetics  of  baricitinib  in  mice,  rats  and  dogs  but  these  studies  only  measured  PK  parameters  of 
([14C]-baricitinib related) radioactivity upon the [14C]-baricitinib phosphate administration to mice, rats, and 
dogs. These studies indicate that absorption in mouse, rat and dog was fast with Cmax at the first time point 
measured  (1  h).  In  addition,  the  single  dose  oral  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  baricitinib  and  the  intravenous 
pharmacokinetics,  upon  a  short  infusion,  were  examined  in  male  Sprague  Dawley  rats,  male  dogs,  male 
monkeys  and  humans.  The  IV  pharmacokinetics  was  characterized  by  moderate  plasma  clearance  values  in 
rat  (1.3  –  4.4  L/hr.kg)  with  lower  values  in  dog  (0.40  L/hr.kg),  monkey  (0.36  L/hr.kg)  and  human  (0.21 
L/hr.kg).  The  volume  of  distribution  (Vss)  was  moderate  in  all  species,  with  values  ranging  from  1.1  L/kg 
(monkey and human), 1.4 L/kg in dog to 2.1 - 6.2 L/kg in rat. The apparent elimination half-life ranged from 
1 - 3 hrs in rat, 3 – 6 hrs in monkey and 4 - 5 hrs in dog. Oral bioavailability from a 0.5% methylcellulose 
aqueous solution formulation was high and ranged from 48% and 54% in dog and rat, 47 – 68% in monkey 
and 79% in human. Oral absorption was relatively fast in all species with peak concentrations occurring about 
0.6, 1.0 and 1.6 hours after dosing in rats, dogs and monkeys, respectively. In humans, following single oral 
dosing,  oral  absorption  was  moderately  fast  with  a  Tmax  of  baricitinib  in  plasma  of  1.0  hour  and  a  terminal 
elimination half-life of 8.6 h was found. 
Single  and  repeat  dose  pharmacokinetic  studies  were  conducted  to  evaluate  the  relative  bioavailability  of 
baricitinib  in  the  free  base  versus  phosphate  salt  forms.  In  both  mice  and  rats  multiple  dose  studies  no 
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 24/132 
  
  
  
meaningful difference in the exposure to baricitinib were found following the administration of the free base 
or phosphate salt forms. 
The  repeated  dose  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  baricitinib  was  obtained  from  toxicokinetic  studies  and 
determined in rat, mice, rabbits and dogs following daily oral administration for up to 9 months of treatment. 
Mouse (wildtype and Tg-rasH2), SD rat and dog have been selected as the animal species for pivotal repeat 
dose studies to assess the systemic toxicity of baricitinib. Generally, on multiple dosing, over all dose ranges 
examined an approximately dose proportional increase (less than 2-fold difference with the increase in dose) 
in  plasma  Cmax  concentrations  and  exposure  was  found.  The  uptake  of  baricitinib  was  relatively  fast  and 
there was evidence of only limited decrease or accumulation (<2-fold) following multiple daily dosing in mice, 
rats and dogs, which is in line with human data. No apparent gender differences in Cmax or exposure were 
noted in dogs and rats while in mice Cmax and exposure values were slightly, but less than 2-fold, higher in 
female than in males.  
Distribution 
Plasma  protein  binding  (PPB)  of  baricitinib  was  moderate  across  all  preclinical  species  examined  (45%  - 
56%).  PPB  was  concentration  independent  from  0.32  –  10.7  μg/ml  (ex  vivo  rat/dog).  Baricitinib  was  also 
approximately 50% unbound in human plasma.  
Blood to  plasma  (B/P)  ratio  of  [14C]-baricitinib  was  0.83  in  mice,  0.93 in  rats  and  1.04  in  dogs  at  Cmax  (1 
hour  postdose)  This  indicates  that  baricitinib  was  evenly  distributed  over  the  blood  cell  and  the  plasma 
compartment, with depending on species, about 45% – 50% binding to blood cells. In humans, the B/P ratio 
was 1.14 at Cmax (range 1.12 - 1.26), indicating a comparable binding to blood cells.  
Quantitative whole-body autoradiographic (QWBA) techniques were used to determine the tissue distribution 
of  baricitinib.  Following  an  oral  administration  of  [14C]-baricitinib  to  male  albino  rats  and  male  and  female 
Long Evans rats, the 14C-radioactivity was distributed into almost all tissues at the first time point, 2 hr post-
dose.  This  was  also  the  Tmax  for  these  tissues,  except  for  the  alimentary  canal.  Distribution  was  extensive 
with  the  highest  concentrations  of  radioactivity  being  found  in  alimentary  canal  contents,  bile,  and  urine. 
Distribution  of  [14C]-baricitinib  related  radioactivity  was  similar  in  pigmented  and  non-pigmented  rats,  with 
the  exception  of  the  pigmented  skin  and  uveal  tract  of  the  eye  in  pigmented  rats,  suggesting  binding  to 
melanin-containing tissues.  
Elimination was nearly complete by 168 hours post-dose in non-pigmented rats and complete by 672 hours 
post-dose  in  pigmented  rats,  except  for  some  levels  of  radioactivity  detectable  in  the  dorsal  caudal  nerve, 
aorta,  and  in  uveal  tract  of  pigmented  rats.  In  pigmented  skin,  [14C]-baricitinib  related  radioactivity  was 
present  up  to  336  hours  post  dose.  The  highest  total  tissue  exposure  of  drug-related  radioactivity  over 
plasma  exposure  ratio  (AUC0-672  T/P)  was  observed  in  the  dorsal  caudal  nerve  (174-fold),  the  aorta  (117-
fold)  and  the  uveal  tract  of  the  eye  (94-fold).  In  toxicology  studies,  including  phototoxicity,  however,  no 
toxicological  findings  were  reported  for  these  tissues  suggesting  that  prolonged  baricitinib  exposure  or 
melanin binding apparently has no toxicological consequences. Concentrations of radioactivity in the eye lens, 
spinal  cord  and  non-circumventricular  central  nervous  system  (CNS)  tissues  (cerebellum,  cerebrum,  and 
medulla) were below measurable levels throughout the course of this study. No sex-dependent differences in 
tissue  distribution  of  14C-radioactivity  were  observed.  In  a  separate  experiment,  the  brain,  cerebrospinal 
fluid  (CSF)  and  plasma  concentrations  of  baricitinib  were  determined  in  rats  after  IV  dosing.  Total  brain 
concentration of  baricitinib  to total  plasma  concentration  was  7.5%  and the  CSF  concentration  was  ~1%  of 
the  total  plasma  concentrations.  The  results  suggest  that  baricitinib  has  minimal  penetration  across  the  rat 
blood brain barrier.

Following  a  single  oral  25-mg/kg  dose  of  [14C]-baricitinib  to  timed-pregnant  female  rats  on  Day  18  of 
gestation,  radioactivity,  as  measured  by  QWBA,  was  widely  distributed  to  maternal  tissues,  crossed  the 
placenta,  and  was  quickly  distributed  to  fetal  tissues.  Fetal  blood  levels  of  [14C]-baricitinib  were  about  2.2 
fold lower than in maternal blood. In maternal tissues, the distribution of [14C]-baricitinib-related radioactivity 
was comparable to previous studies. Most maternal and all fetal tissues reached their highest concentrations 
at  0.5  hours  post-dose.  Placental  transfer  and  subsequent  fetal  exposure  to  [14C]-baricitinib-related 
radioactivity occurred at moderate to low levels (up to 5080 ng eq [14C]-baricitinib/g) through 8 hours post-
dose. Highest levels were found in amniotic sac, placenta, fetal gastrointestinal tract and fetal adrenal gland. 
All fetal tissue radioactivity concentrations were maximal 3-fold fetal blood levels and were below the limit of 
quantitation or not detectable by the final sampling time at 24 hours post-dose. 
Following  a  single  oral  25  mg/kg  dose  of  [14C]-baricitinib  to  lactating  dams,  [14C]-baricitinib-related 
radioactivity was highly excreted into the milk. Peak concentrations of radioactivity were observed at 4 hours 
postdose  in  milk  (33600  ng  eq.  [14C]-baricitinib/g)  and  1  hour  postdose  for  plasma  (1900  ng  eq.  [14C]-
baricitinib/g) and declined similarly to low levels by 24 hours postdose. Exposure to [14C]-baricitinib-related 
radioactivity was approximately 39- and 18-fold greater in milk than in plasma based on AUC0-∞ and Cmax 
values, respectively. The  elimination half-lives of radioactivity in plasma and  milk were similar (2.6 and 2.7 
hours, respectively) (see SmPC section 5.3). 
Metabolism 
Multiple  nonclinical  studies  were  conducted  in  mice,  rats,  rabbits,  and  dogs  to  evaluate  the  in  vivo 
metabolism of baricitinib throughout the development of the molecule. These studies indicate that following a 
single oral dose of [14C]-baricitinib, the in vivo metabolism was minimal and that the parent compound was 
the primary circulating entity in plasma and also the major component excreted in both urine and feces in all 
species, including human.  
Biotransformation  of  baricitinib  in  nonclinical  species  (CD1-mouse,  Sprague-Dawley  rat,  New  Zealand  white 
rabbit, Beagle dog) and human  were represented by mono-oxidation (M9, M10) and bis-oxidation (M22) on 
either  the  pyrazole  or  pyrimidine  ring,  oxidative  ring  opening  of  the  pyrrole  ring  (M13,  M3,  M12)  and 
glucuronidation (M6). In addition, several minor oxidative metabolites were also identified in these species. 
In plasma of nonclinical species, baricitinib was the primary drug-related component in mice (81 - 92%), rats 
(79% - 93%), rabbits (95%) and dogs (84% - 96%). In human plasma, no detectable circulating metabolites 
were found but only baricitinib (96%) was present. In addition, in plasma from nonclinical species about nine 
metabolites  were  identified,  which  were  each  less  than  10%.  These  metabolites  were  found  in  mouse  (M3, 
M6, M9, M10, M22), rat (M13), rabbit (M7, M17) and dog (M2). 
Excreta: After a single oral dose in CD-1 mice, drug-related radioactivity was mainly eliminated unchanged in 
urine (15% of the dose) and feces (39%). In urine, about 8% is excreted as metabolites of which M10 (3%) 
was  largest.  In  feces  ~23%  is  excreted  as  thirteen  metabolites  of  which  the  highest  (7%)  is  an  unknown 
radioactive peak. 
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 26/132 
  
  
  
In both intact and bile duct cannulated (BDC) rats,  parent drug and nine metabolites were quantified in rat 
urine,  feces  and  bile  following  a  single  oral or  intravenous  dose  of  [14C]-baricitinib phosphate.  After  an  oral 
dose,  drug-related  radioactivity  was  mainly  eliminated  in  feces  (40%  -  65%  of  dose)  of  which  40%  was 
baricitinib and 0%-16% were metabolites and with ~29% of dose in urine (17%-20% as parent and <10% 
as  metabolites),  while  bile  only  consisted  of  ~18%  of  the  dose  (~2%  as  parent).  A  majority  of  the 
intravenous  dose  (49%),  however,  was  excreted  in  urine  as  unchanged  baricitinib  (35%  of  the  dose),  with 
several small amounts of metabolites. Feces of BDC rats, only contained unchanged baricitinib (11%) upon IV 
administration  suggesting  intestinal  secretion.  Bile  excretion  was  21%  of  the  dose  and  contained  twenty 
metabolites including 2% as unchanged parent. The metabolite profiles in BDC rats indicated that that biliary 
excretion and metabolism was a minor clearance route of baricitinib in rats.  
In dog, a majority of the single oral dose of [14C]-baricitinib phosphate was excreted as unchanged parent in 
urine  (24%  -  34%  of  the  dose)  and  feces  (9%  -  20%),  or  as  metabolites  M2,  M13,  M3,  M4  and  M10  (all 
<10% in urine/feces).  
In humans, unchanged parent and a total of four minor metabolites were identified in urine (M22, M3, M10) 
and  feces  (M12)  from  six  healthy  male  subjects  administered  a  single  10  mg  dose.  In  urine,  unchanged 
parent  drug  was  the  most  abundant  radioactive  peak  (69%  of  the  dose).  Metabolite  M22  was  the  most 
abundant metabolite in urine (2% - 5%), while metabolites M3 and M10 each accounted for ~1% of the dose 
excreted in urine. In human feces parent drug (15%) was also the major component and M12 was ~1%.  
Excretion 
The route of excretion of [14C]-baricitinib-derived radioactivity was determined in mice, rats (intact and BDC), 
and  dogs.  In  all  species,  the  total  recoveries  of  radioactivity  ranged  from  approximately  88%  to  99%.  In 
mice,  upon  oral  administration,  feces  (62%)  was  the  predominant  route  of  elimination,  while  24%  was 
excreted  by  urine.  In  dogs,  upon  oral  administration,  the  routes  of  elimination  were  similar  in  urine  (39%) 
and  feces  (45%).  In  both  intact  and  BDC  rats  similar  excretion  profile  was  found  upon  oral  administration, 
where 29% was excreted in urine and 53% - 65% in feces (or feces and bile combined). Following a single IV 
dose, however, urine was the predominant route of elimination (50%) whereas 21% was excreted in bile and 
12% in feces, which suggests a low level of intestinal secretion in rats.  
In  healthy  male  humans,  urine  and  feces  analysis  following  a  single  10  mg  oral  dose  showed  that  urine 
(75%) is the major route of elimination, while about 20% of radioactivity was recovered from feces.

No  mortality  was  observed  after  oral  administration  of  baricitinib  up  to  1200 mg/kg  to  mice,  600  mg/kg  to 
rats  and  40  mg/kg  to  dogs.  Baricitinib  was  tolerated  well  in  mice  and  rats  with  mostly  non-adverse 
observations such as pink coloration of urine and urogenital staining in mice and redness of ears, paws and 
testes and staining on face, forelimbs and urogenital area in rats. In some rats at ≥200 mg/kg, hair loss was 
observed. In dogs, baricitinib was less well tolerated, with temporary protrusion of the nictitating membrane, 
swelling  and/or  lacrimation  of  eyes,  decreased  activity,  emesis,  soft  feces,  and  at  40  mg/kg  in  one  animal 
ataxia and tremors. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies were performed in mice (CD-1), rats (Sprague-Dawley) and Beagle dogs. In 
addition, a study was performed in CByB6F1-Tg (RasH2 wild type) mice for the dose selection for the 6-
month carcinogenicity study in RasH2 mice. Study duration was up to 3 months in mice, 6 months in rats and 
9 months in dogs. The pivotal dog studies included ECG measurements, which were performed prior to 
dosing, on day 1 of dosing (28-day study only), during the last week of dose administration and during the 
recovery phase. Immunophenotyping was performed in the 6-month and 9-month dog studies, by flow 
cytometry. In the 28-day mouse study (T08-07-08), no histopathology was performed. 
The results of the repeat-dose toxicity studies are shown in table 11.

a Males were administered 100 mg/kg for the duration of the study. Females were administered 100 mg/kg for 22-23 consecutive doses, 
followed by a dosing holiday of 3-4 days and administered 60 mg/kg for remainder of study.

b Starting on Day 17, the administered dosage was decreased to 0.75 mg/kg/day for the remainder of the study. 
c Starting on Day 17, the administered dosage was decreased to 2.5 mg/kg/day for the remainder of the study. 
d The dose level of 20 mg/kg was administered on Days 1-3, followed by 3-day dosing holiday. A dose level of 15 mg/kg was administered 
on Days 7-11 followed by a 10-day dosing holiday. Dosing resumed at a dose level of 5 mg/kg on Day 22 and continued for the remainder of 
the study. 
e Dogs were administered 9 mg/kg from Day 1-50, given a dosing holiday from Day 51-57 and administered 6 mg/kg for the remainder of 
the study. 
Significant immune suppression was observed in mice, rats and dogs. In all species, decreases in 
lymphocytes, eosinophils and basophils were observed as well as lymphoid depletion in organs/tissues of the 
immune system such as spleen, thymus, Peyer’s patch, and lymph nodes and mixed depletion in bone 
marrow (see SmPC section 5.3). Opportunistic infections with the Demodex mite were observed in dogs (see 
SmPC section 5.3). Immunophenotyping revealed decreased cytotoxic T-cells in female dogs at low dose in 
the 6-month study and decreased T-helper cells in the 9-month dog study at 6-9 times the human exposure. 
Decreased lymphocytes, eosinophils and basophils and mixed depletion of bone marrow in rats and 
decreased eosinophils and CD8+ T-cells in dogs were observed at exposures similar to the human therapeutic 
exposure or slightly above (based on AUC). Demodex infections in dogs started to occur at exposures similar 
to the human therapeutic exposure with dose-dependent increases in severity of symptoms. Symptoms at 
higher doses became so severe that several animals were sacrificed in moribund condition (starting at 2.5-5 
mg/kg/day and 9-17-fold the human exposure). In mice, evidence of immune suppression occurred at higher 
exposures (starting at 18-fold the human exposure). Haematologic changes in mice, rats and dogs were 
partially or completely reversed. There was still evidence of lymphocyte depletion in the lymphoid organs at 
the end of the recovery period.  
Decreases  in  red  blood  cell  parameters  were  observed  in  mice,  rats  and  dogs.  In  rats,  decreases  in 
reticulocytes  were  observed  at  exposures  slightly  higher  than  the  human  exposure  (2-6  times  the  human 
exposure). Decreases in red blood cells, haemoglobin and haematocrit were observed in mice, rats and dogs 
at higher exposures (starting at 6-9 times the human exposure in dogs) (see SmPC section 5.3). 
Effects on the liver were observed in mice, rats and dogs. Effects in mice (increased ALT and AST) and rats 
(inflammation, hepatocellular necrosis, hyperplasia and increased ALP in males) in the repeated dose studies 
were observed at very high exposures only. In the 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats, evidence of focal fatty 
changes was observed in the liver at 5-8 times the human exposure. Effects in dogs consisted of periportal 
inflammation  and  bile  duct  hyperplasia  as  well  as  increases  in  transaminases  (from  6-9  times  the  human 
exposure).  The  effects  in  dogs  were  likely  related  to  the  infections  that  occurred  in  dogs.  Periportal 
inflammation may have been part of a systemic inflammatory state as a result of the serious infections. Bile 
duct hyperplasia and liver enzyme increases were observed only in a 9-month study in which the dogs were 
treated with ivermectin and thus it is likely that these effects were mainly due to ivermectin treatment. 
Renal toxicity (kidney infarct and tubule degeneration/necrosis in mice and chronic progressive nephropathy 
and  crystal  formation  accompanied  by  tubular  degeneration  in  rats)  and  cardiomyopathy  in  rats  were 
observed at high exposures (at least 22 times the human exposure). 
Some  effects  were  observed  on  male  and  female  genitals,  mainly  at  high  exposures.  In  RasH2  wild  type 
mice,  degeneration  of  the  seminiferous  tubule  in  the  testis  was  observed  at  300  mg/kg/day  (at  least  50x 
human  exposure).  In  dogs,  prostate  atrophy  was  observed  at  lower  exposures  (3  mg/kg/day,  6-7x  human 
exposure), but this was not accompanied by changes in the spermatogenesis. Uterus atrophy and decreased 
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 33/132 
  
  
  
corpora  lutea  in  the  ovary  were  observed  in  RasH2  wild  type  mice,  at  very  high  exposures  only  (at  300 
mg/kg/day, 65-169x human exposure). In rats, no effects were observed on the reproductive organs, but in 
rat fertility studies, decreased fertility was observed (see Reproductive and developmental toxicity). 
Degeneration/necrosis of the sternal growth plate was observed in several dogs treated for 9 months, at low 
incidence but with a dose-effect relationship in number and severity of the observations. The fact that this 
effect was observed only in the 9-month study and mostly in the recovery phase indicates an effect which 
only occurs after long-term treatment (see SmPC section 5.3).

Toxicokinetics 
The main toxicokinetic results are shown in the table below. Animal:human exposure multiples are based on 
the human AUC in patients with rheumatoid arthritis after multiple 4 mg once daily dosing during the dosing 
interval at steady state (AUCτ,ss) of 477.6 ng*hr/mL (from the Phase 2/3 PopPK Analysis).

Carcinogenicity 
Long-term studies 
A 6-month study was performed in RasH2 mice and a 2-year study in Fischer 344 rats. In the mouse study, 
hemizygous RasH2 mice were used for the toxicology animals and wild type RasH2 mice for the toxicokinetics 
animals. In the mouse study, a positive control group was added (10/sex/group) which received one 
intraperitoneal dose of 75 mg/kg N-methyl-N-nitrosourea. The results are shown in the table below.

Mouse  
The maximum dose was selected as 300 mg/kg/day for males based on >50% suppression of lymphocyte 
counts in the 1-month study in RasH2 mice. The maximum dose was 150 mg/kg/day for females based on 
adverse kidney findings at 300 mg/kg/day.

Unscheduled deaths/sacrifices were 2, 1, 2, 3 males at 0, 15, 40, 300 mg/kg/day and 3, 4, 3, 5 females at 0, 
10, 30, 150 mg/kg/day. These mortalities were considered not treatment-related. 
No baricitinib-related neoplastic changes were observed. In the positive control group, a robust carcinogenic 
response was observed with occurrence of a high incidence of neoplasms, most often hematopoietic 
(lymphosarcoma), vascular (hemangiosarcoma), nonglandular stomach (squamous cell), and 
skin/subcutaneous tissue (squamous cell) neoplasms. 
Rat 
A maximum dose of 8 mg/kg/day for males was based on a substantial decrease in body weight gain in the 
6-month study. The high dose for females was 25 mg/kg based on immunosuppression observed at that 
dose. 
Unscheduled deaths/sacrifices were 42, 37, 32, 29 males at 0, 1, 3, 8 mg/kg/day and 40, 35, 34, 28 females 
at 0, 3, 8, 25 mg/kg/day. A dose-related increase in survival was observed which was ascribed to the lower 
body weights in treated animals. Body weights were slightly lower in treated animals than in control animals 
but only at the high dose, significantly decreased body weight gain was observed, which was more obvious in 
males than in females. Due to low survival in the control animals, the study was terminated after Week 94 
for the males and during Week 91 for the females.  
No baricitinib-related increased incidence in tumors was observed.

In rat, male and female fertility and copulation/conception indices were decreased at 50 and 100 mg/kg/day 
baricitinib,  respectively.  Furthermore,  early  resorptions  were  increased  in  females  at  25  mg/kg/day  and  at 
100 mg/kg/day number of corpora lutea and implantation sites were lowered and pre-implantation loss was 
higher.  The  fertility  study  was  a  combined  male  and  female  fertility  assessment,  and  therefore  it  is  not 
certain  whether  male,  female  or  both  were  responsible  for  the  decreased  fertility.  However,  due  to  a 
decreased number of corpora lutea and intrauterine survival, the female reproductive process was affected by 
baricitinib.  Also  no  compound-related  effects  were  observed  on  sperm  motility  or  concentration  and  sperm 
morphology for males at any dose level (see SmPC section 5.3). At the NOAEL the safety margin compared to 
the MRHD was 12 and 4 fold for male and female fertility, respectively.  
Baricitinib  reduced  foetal  weight  at  40  mg/kg/day  in  presence  of  maternal  toxicity  and  increased  the 
incidence  of  limb  bone  and  rib  anomalies  in  rats  from  10  mg/kg/day  in  absence  of  maternal  toxicity  (see 
SmPC  section  5.3).  In  rabbit,  baricitinib  reduced  foetal  weight  and  induced  post-implantation  loss,  with  a 
concurrent  reduction  in  viable  foetuses  at  30  mg/kg/day.  At  this  dose,  two  maternal  animals  died,  but  in 
other maternal animals in this dose group no adverse effects were observed. A low number of foetuses with 
vertebral  anomalies  was  observed  in  rabbit  foetuses.  At  the  NOAELs  in  rat  and  rabbit,  the  safety  margin 
compared to MRHD was 2-fold in both species.

Baricitinib  reduced  postnatal  survival  and  mean  pup  body  weight  prior  to  and  following  weaning  at  25 
mg/kg/day  (see  SmPC  section  5.3).  Additionally,  an  increased  incidence  of  malrotated  forelimbs  was 
observed  in  this  group.  Comparable  effects  were  noted  in  the  rat  embryo-foetal  development  study; 
therefore,  this  effect  must  have  developed  during  the  period  of  organogenesis.  Furthermore,  baricitinib-
related effects were observed on forelimb/hindlimb grip strength at this dosage level. In F1 females, cytotoxic 
T-cells  were  decreased  at  PDN35  and  T  helper  cells  were  increased  at  PND  65.  No  effects  on  reproductive 
parameters in the F1 group or on survival of the F2 group were noted. The NOAEL for the F1 generation was 
2 mg/kg/day, corresponding to a safety margin of 1.5 fold compared to exposure at the MRHD.

Baricitinib is neither PBT nor vPvB. 
Considering the above data and the environmental risk assessment, baricitinib is not expected to pose a risk 
to the surface water and groundwater compartment and the sewage treatment plant. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Baricitinib is a selective and balanced inhibitor against JAK 1 and JAK2 with less potency for TYK2 and far less 
potency for JAK3. Baricitinib improved clinical and histological signs in several rodent arthritic related models 
of disease. In the rat adjuvant arthritis model, baricitinib reduced inflammation at plasma levels between 53 
and 480 nM, which compares well with the in vitro assays. However, the oral human Cmax is about 144 nM 
(4 mg/day, 53,4 ng/ml), which is in the neighbourhood of the IC50, but only during the peaks. In a similar 
model with oral dosing of 3 and 10 mg/kg/day baricitinib, clinical and histological signs were reduced by 39-
82%  at  predicted  AUC-values  of  2  –  6.7  µM.h.  With  a  human  AUC  of  about  1.3  µM  (478  ng  h/ml)  at  4 
mg/day the effects may be suboptimal in humans. 
Baricitinib is not expected to produce effects related to secondary pharmacology at clinical doses due to the 
specificity of baricitinib for the JAK1/2 target.  
The  PK  /  ADME  data  submitted  were  considered  to  be  sufficient  and  in  accordance  with  legal  requirements 
and  available  guidelines.  The  nonclinical  absorption,  distribution,  metabolism  and  excretion  (ADME)  studies 
have  been  conducted,  IV  and  PO,  in  the  same  species  as  used  in  the  toxicology  studies  (PO  in  mouse,  rat, 
dog and rabbit).  
Baricitinib is a lipophilic compound with very low solubility in aqueous solutions at neutral pH. Oral absorption 
was, as in humans, relatively fast. Oral bioavailability was high. The relative bioavailability of baricitinib in the 
free  base  versus  phosphate  salt  forms  was  similar.  The  pharmacokinetics  was  further  characterized  by  a 
moderate to low plasma clearance and volume of distribution. There was evidence of only limited decrease or 
accumulation  (<2-fold)  following  multiple  daily  dosing  in  mice,  rats  and  dogs,  which  is  in  line  with  human 
data. No apparent gender differences in Cmax or exposure were noted. More than 10-fold exposure multiples 
as compared to human exposure was achieved in the mouse, rat and dog. 
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 42/132 
  
  
  
 
The in vivo tissue distribution in rat was fast and showed that baricitinib related radioactivity was distributed 
into  most  tissues  through  2  hr  post-dose,  with  the  alimentary  canal  contents,  bile,  and  urine  having  the 
highest  exposure.  Lowest  exposure  was  found  in  eye  lens,  spinal  cord  and  non-circumventricular  central 
nervous  system  tissues.  Placental  transfer  and  subsequent  fetal  exposure  to  [14C]-baricitinib-related 
radioactivity  occurred  at  moderate  to  low  levels.  Exposure  of  [14C]-baricitinib-related  radioactivity  was 
approximately 39-fold greater in milk than in plasma. A warning has been included in section 4.6 to alert that 
Olumiant should not be used during breast-feeding, due to the immunosuppressive action of barcitinib. 
Drug-derived  radioactivity  was  found  to  be  below  quantifiable  limits  (BQL)  at  all  time  points  in  pigmented 
rats,  while  in  non-pigmented  male  rats  low  levels  of  radioactivity  were  detected  in  the  brain  at  2  hours 
postdose, but were BQL at all other time points out to 168 hours. Considering the fact that low levels were 
only detected at the 2 hour time point and that baricitinib is a substrate of the drug-efflux transporter, ABCB1 
(MDR1/Pgp)  which  is  expressed  in  the  blood  brain  barrier,  this  is  unlikely  to  result  from  direct  transport  to 
the  brain.  Most  likely,  low  levels  of  radioactivity  were  from  the  vascular  system  resulting  from  the 
exsanguination performed prior to animal preparation for imaging. 
Plasma protein binding (PPB) of baricitinib is moderate across all preclinical species examined and in human 
plasma (~50%) meaning that free baricitinib levels are about half of the measured plasma concentration in 
mouse,  rat,  rabbit,  dog  and  in  humans.  The  blood  to  plasma  (B/P)  ratio  of  [14C]-baricitinib  indicates  that 
baricitinib  was  evenly  distributed  over  the  blood  cell  and  the  plasma  compartment,  with  depending  on 
species, including human, about 50% binding to blood cells. 
The  metabolism  data  indicate  that  biotransformation  is  low  and  that  there  are  no  major  differences  in 
circulating  or  excreted  metabolites  across  species.  In  addition,  the  minor  metabolites  observed  in  human 
excreta are also observed in at least one biological matrix. 
Baricitinib was primarily cleared via renal excretion in human, and by faecal elimination in the mouse and rat, 
while  in  dogs  elimination  was  comparable  in  urine  and  faeces.  This  indicates  that  there  are  species 
differences in the primary routes of elimination of baricitinib. 
Baricitinib  induced  significant  immune  suppression  in  animals,  visible  as  decreases  in  white  blood  cell 
parameters  and  lymphoid  depletion  in  organs  and  the  occurrence  of  opportunistic  infections  in  dogs.  Partly 
these effects also occurred at human therapeutic exposures. An increased risk of infections can therefore be 
expected when Olumiant is used. A decrease in red blood cell parameters was also observed in mice, rat and 
dogs.  
Degeneration/necrosis  of  the  sternal  growth  plate  in  dogs  and  skeletal  malformations  in  the  embryofoetal 
development  study  in  rats  indicate that  baricitinib  may  have  the  potential  to  have  an  adverse  effect  on  the 
growth  of  bone.  In  rat  and  rabbit  reproductive  toxicology  studies,  barcitinib  was  shown  to  reduce  foetal 
growth/weight and produce skeletal malformations. In  view of the preclinical data showing teratogenicity of 
baricitinib in rats and rabbits and the observed adverse effect on the growth of bone, CHMP decided to adopt 
a formal contra-indication for the use of barcitinib during pregnancy (see SmPC section 4.3). 
Kidney  toxicity  and  cardiomyopathy  in  mice  and  rats  were  observed  at  sufficiently  high  exposures  and  are 
therefore considered likely not clinically relevant. 
Baricitinib had adverse effects on female and male fertility, embryonic development and pre- and post-natal 
development.  The  safety  margin  for  skeletal  anomalies  in  rats  was  low.  A  low  number  of  foetuses  with 
vertebral anomalies were observed in rabbit foetuses which were not statistically significant, but considering 
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 43/132 
  
  
  
the  fact  that  skeletal  malformations  were  observed  in  rats  as  well,  this  may  be  considered  biologically 
relevant (see SmPC section 5.3).  
Baricitinib was not genotoxic in the Ames test, an in vitro chromosome aberration assay and an in vivo rat 
micronucleus assay. No increases in tumours were observed in a 6-month study in RasH2 mice and in a 2-
year study in rats.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
After  oral  administration  of  baricitinib,  Cmax  levels  are  reached  ~1h  after  dosing  (0.5-3.0  h).  The  absolute 
bioavailability after oral administration of baricitinib from the commercial tablet is ~79% (CV=3.94%). At the 
clinical dose of 4 mg, the Cmax is ~112 nM and the AUC0-∞ is 740 nM × h in healthy volunteers. The intra-
individual variability in AUC and Cmax is low (<14%) and the inter-individual variability moderate (17-26%). 
In subjects with Rheumatoid Arthritis, the Cmax (~135 nM) and AUCτ (~1200 nM × h) are higher compared 
to healthy volunteers. In addition, CL/F is ~46% lower and t½ ~25% lower in Rheumatoid Arthritis patients 
relative  to  that  in  heathy  subjects.  Furthermore,  the  inter-individual  variability  in  Rheumatoid  Arthritis 
patients is higher compared to healthy subjects (41% versus ~22%). 
Capsule  formulations  were  initially  developed  for  use  in  early  clinical  studies.  An  immediate-release  tablet 
formulation (referred to as Phase 2 Tablet) containing baricitinib free base was developed prior to commercial 
development.  The  final  Commercial  Tablet  formulation  containing  baricitinib  free  base  was  developed  and 
used for all the Phase 3 studies in RA patients. The Commercial Tablet and the Phase 2 Tablet have similar 
unit formulas. 
Two relative bioavailability studies were conducted: study JADH (comparing capsules to Phase 2 tablet) and 
study JAGO (comparing Phase 2 tablets to Commercial tablets). 
In study JAGO, a relative bioavailability study was conducted between the 4 mg Phase 2 tablet and the 4 mg 
Commercial  tablet  under  fasted  conditions.  The  Cmax  ratio  was  0.955  (90%  CI  is  0.876-1.04).  The  AUC0-∞ 
ratio was 0.986 (90% CI is 0.950-1.02). The 90% CIs fell within the traditional bioequivalence boundaries of 
0.8 to 1.25 and there was no difference in t max between the 2 formulations in the fasted state. 
In study JADH, a relative bioavailability study was conducted between the 8 mg Phase 2b capsule (phosphate 
salt) and the 8 mg Phase 2 tablet (free base) under fasted conditions. The Cmax ratio was 0.962 (90% CI is 
0.852-1.08). The AUC0-∞ ratio was 1.02 (90% CI is 0.947-1.09). The 90% CIs fell within the traditional 
bioequivalence boundaries of 0.8 to 1.25 and there was no difference in t max between the 2 formulations in 
the fasted state. 
A low-fat meal led to a 14% decrease in AUC0-∞ and an 11% decrease in Cmax, which did not lead to a 
significant effect in the pharmacokinetics of bariticinib. A high-fat meal decreased the AUC with 4-11% and 
the Cmax with 10-18%. The decrease in Cmax and AUC were considered to be clinically not relevant. 
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding 
The  protein  binding  of  baricitinib  (10  µM)  was  determined  in  vitro  using  an  equilibrium  dialysis  method  in 
human plasma and serum (study DMB-08-14-1). The protein binding of baricitinib in plasma was 49% at 10 
μM and 50% at 1 μM, with an overall mean fraction unbound of 50 ± 2% in plasma. The protein binding of 
baricitinib  in  serum  was  53%  at  10  μM,  55%  at  3  μM  and  57%  at  1  μM,  with  an  overall  mean  fraction 
unbound of 55±3% in serum.  
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 48/132 
  
  
  
 
Blood-to-plasma ratio 
The  blood-to-plasma  ratio  of  baricitinib  was  not  investigated  in  vitro.  Clinical  study  JADG  showed  that  the 
mean  ratios  of  AUC0-12  and  Cmax  for  total  radioactivity  in  whole  blood  to  plasma  were  slightly  greater  than 
one (1.14 for AUC and Cmax).  
In vivo distribution 
The  in  vivo  human  distribution  of  baricitinib  was  investigated  in  study  JAGM  after  IV  infustion  of  4  μg 
15N)-baricitinib for approximately 1.5 hours. Mean volume of distribution (Vd) was 75.7 L (21% CV), 
(13C4D 3
suggesting distribution of baricitinib into tissues. The mean body weight was 70 kg, resulting in a Vd of 1.08 
L/kg. 
The plasma protein binding of baricitinib is ~50% and was independent of the concentration (including 
clinically relevant concentrations). The blood-to-plasma ratio is 1.14 and the volume of distribution is ~1.1 
L/kg. 
Elimination 
Only  baricitinib  was  detected  circulating  in  human  plasma.  Metabolites  accounted  for  4-7%  of  the  dose  in 
urine and ~1% in faeces. In addition, baricitinib is metabolised to a limited extent in vitro. 
In vitro studies indicate that baricitinib is a substrate for P-glycoprotein, BCRP, OAT3 and MATE2-K. Baricitnib 
is not a substrate for OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OCT1, OCT2, and MATE1. 
The elimination half-life of baricitinib is ~8 h in healthy volunteers. Baricitinib is mainly excreted via urine and 
predominately  as  parent  compound.  Around  20%  of  the  dose  is  excreted  via  faeces.  The  total  clearance  is 
~17 L/h and the renal clearance is ~13.4 L/h in healthy subjects. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The Cmax and AUC0-∞ increases dose-proportional in healthy subjects, over a single dose range of 1 to 30 
mg (slightly more over the dose range 30 to 40 mg). However, the Phase 1,2a capsules and the Phase 2 
tablets were used for determination of the dose-proportionately.  
The kinetics of baricitinib from the commercial tablet was dose proportional over 2 to 4 mg. After multiple 
once-daily dosing, steady state was reached between the second and third dose. Accumulation after repeated 
dose administration of baricitinib is minimal; the accumulation ratio ranged from 0.89-1.25-fold and 1.02-
1.24-fold based on Cmax and AUC, respectively. 
The pharmacokinetics of baricitinib was predictable from single dose data, suggesting that baricitinib 
possesses linear pharmacokinetics with respect to time. 
Special populations 
The effect on the pharmacokinetics of baricitinib of renal function, hepatic function, age, weight, race, 
gender, and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate were investigated, including PopPK Analysis.  
Moderate hepatic impairment, age (age range of 19 to 83 years) and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate 
(measure of disease state) did not have a clinically significant effect on the exposure to baricitinib.  
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 49/132 
  
  
  
A reduction in baricitinib renal clearance and an increase in the AUC were observed with increased severity of 
renal impairment.  
The effect of renal impairment on the PK of baricitinib was evaluated in the clinical pharmacology Study I4V-
MC-JADL (JADL) and subsequent Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies. 
JADL was a Phase 1, Open-Label, Single-Dose, Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic and Safety Study of 
INCB028050 (10 and 5 mg) administered to Subjects with various degrees of renal impairment (mild, 
moderate, severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease [ESRD] requiring hemodialysis [HD]). 
The pharmacokinetics of INCB028050 was significantly affected by renal function. 
The  INCB028050  pharmacokinetic  parameters  and  geometric  mean  ratios  (reference=healthy  cohort)  are 
presented in table 22 below by cohort.

In patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, a less pronounced effect of the renal function on the exposure of 
baricitinib was observed.

Cmax decreased with increasing body weight. However, the effect of body weight on baricitinib PK is not 
considered clinically relevant.  
Gender and race (American versus Japanese) were shown to have an effect on the PK of baricitinib but were 
considered to not be clinically relevant. 
No clinical studies with baricitinib were performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Baricitinib is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4, and 3A5 3A5 at clinically relevant 
concentrations. In addition, baricitinib is not an inducer via AhR, PXR and CAR at clinically relevant maximal 
plasma concentrations, portal vein concentrations and maximal intestinal concentrations.  
Furthermore,  baricitinib  is  not  an  inhibitor  of  the  transporters  P-glycoprotein,  BCRP,  OATP1B1,  OATP1B3, 
OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE-1 and MATE2-K at clinically relevant concentrations. Baricitinib may be an 
inhibitor of OCT1 at maximal portal vein concentrations. 
In  clinical  DDI  studies,  the  potential  of  baricitinib  to  affect  the  PK  of  oral  contraceptives  (via  CYP3A), 
simvastatin  (via  CYP3A  and  OATP1B1),  and  digoxin  (via  P-glycoprotein)  was  investigated.  The  clinical  DDI 
studies confirm the in vitro data that baricitinib is not an inhibitor or inducer of CYP3A and not an inhibitor of 
P-glycoprotein.  Concomitant  administration  with  simvastatin  led  to  a  (not  clinically  significant)  decrease  in 
AUC and Cmax of simvastatin. The underlying mechanism of action is unknown. Furthermore, baricitinib does 
not  have  an  effect  on  the  PK  of  methotrexate,  a  commonly  concomitant  prescribed  drug,  in  Rheumatoid 
Arthritis patients. 
In  the  clinical  safety  studies,  an  effect  on  the  creatinine  clearance  was  observed  (decrease  in  creatinine 
clearance). Creatinine is cleared by the following transporters OCT2, OAT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K. Baricitinib 
was not an inhibitor of OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K at clinically relevant concentrations.  
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 52/132 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
In  vitro  and  in  vivo  data  indicate  that  >10%  of  the  baricitinib  dose  is  metabolised.  Baricitinib  is  actively 
excreted by the transporters P-glycoprotein, BCRP, OAT3 and MATE2-K. In clinical DDI studies, the potential 
of other drugs to affect the PK of baricitinib was investigated. A clinically significant interaction was observed 
when baricitinib was co-administered with probenecid (a strong OAT3 inhibitor). No other clinical DDI studies 
have  been  conducted  with  OAT3  inhibitors  with  less  inhibition  potential.  The  prodrug  leflunomide,  which 
rapidly  converts  to  teriflunomide  and  teriflunomide,  is  an  inhibitor  of  OAT3  (furosemide  exposure  was 
increased in patients concomitantly taking teriflunomide and furosemide). 
Co-administration  of  ketoconazole  (strong  CYP3A  inhibition),  fluconazole  (strong  CYP2C19  inhibition  and 
moderate  CYP2C9  and  3A  inhibition),  rifampicin  (inducer  via  CAR/PXR  of  among  others  CYP3A  and  P-
glycoprotein)  and  cyclosporine  (P-glycoprotein  inhibition)  with  baricitinib  did  not  have  a  clinically  relevant 
effect on the pharmacokinetics of baricitinib.  
No in vivo studies were performed for inhibition of BCRP and MATE2-K. Increase in gastric pH does not affect 
the overall exposure to baricitinib.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Baricitinib is a selective and reversible inhibitor of Janus kinase (JAK)1 and JAK2. In isolated enzyme assays, 
baricitinib inhibited the activities of JAK1, JAK2, Tyrosine Kinase 2 and JAK3 with IC50 values of 5.9, 5.7, 53 
and > 400 nM, respectively. 
Janus  kinases  (JAKs)  are  enzymes  that  transduce  intracellular  signals  from  cell  surface  receptors  for  a 
number  of  cytokines  and  growth  factors  involved  in  haematopoiesis,  inflammation  and  immune  function. 
Within the intracellular signalling pathway, JAKs phosphorylate and activate signal transducers and activators 
of transcription (STATs), which activate gene expression within the cell. Baricitinib modulates these signalling 
pathways by partially inhibiting JAK1 and JAK2 enzymatic activity, thereby reducing the phosphorylation and 
activation of STATs. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
According  to  the  data  provided,  the  duration  of  exposure  over  the  IC50  for  signalling  mediated  by  the 
common  gamma-chain  cytokines  that  use  the  JAK1/JAK3  heterodimer,  including  IL-15  and  IL-21, is  shorter 
for  baricitinib  than  reported  for  tofacitinib,  based  on  in  vitro  experiment  with  peripheral  blood  mononuclear 
cell  preparations  from  healthy  donors.  To  be  noted,  barcitinib  is  dosed  once  daily,  whereas  the  regular 
tofacitinib dose is 5 mg twice daily, in RA.

Interleukin IL6 study 
As  baricitinib  is  a  JAK1/JAK2  inhibitor  and  IL-6  signals  via  a  JAK1/JAK2  heterodimer,  an  IL-6  stimulated 
pSTAT  assay  was  developed.  Pharmacokinetic  modeling  indicates  that  for  baricitinib  4  mg  once-daily,  there 
will be a 12-hour period during the 24 h dosing interval when the baricitinib serum concentration is below the 
50% inhibitory threshold for IL-6 stimulated STAT phosphorylation (figure 10 below).

Time (hr)
Baricitinib inhibits CK-induced JAK-mediated phosphorylation of STAT3 (P-STAT3) in a dose-dependent 
manner. Maximum inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation occurs at 1-2 hr post dose and concurs with Cmax. P-
STAT3 levels return to normal at about 24 hrs following single or multiple doses, even when dosed for 10 
days. 
Secondary pharmacodynamics 
In healthy volunteers, baricitinib had no relevant effect on total cholesterol in healthy volunteers. A modest 
increment was observed after a supratherapeutic dose, with wide confidence intervals.

Immunoglobulins 
Mean  absolute  lymphocyte  count  increased  by  1  week  after  starting  treatment  with  barcitinib,  returned  to 
baseline after week 24, and then remained stable through at least 104 weeks. For most patients, changes in 
lymphocyte count occurred within normal reference range.

Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances  
Baricitinib should not be used with biologic DMARDs, for safety reasons, as the clinical consequences of 
blocking multiple pathways cannot be foreseen.  However, the combination with conventional DMARDS was 
widely applied in the main clinical trials. 
PK-PD relationship 
Dose/exposure  –  response  relationships  were  characterized  for  DAS28-hsCRP  <=3.2  (Low  Disease  Activity) 
and  <2.6  (remission)  response  rates  by  exposure  quartile  analysis  and  by  PopPK/PD  modeling.  In  the 
exposure response analysis, the majority of Cav,ss values in the lowest quartile were from the baricitinib 2-
mg  dose  while  values  in  the  upper  two  quartiles  were  comprised  almost  entirely  of  values  from  the  4-mg 
dose. Higher rates of ACR and DAS28-hsCRP responses were observed in the 3 upper quartiles of exposure 
compared to the lowest quartile (see figure 12 below). No apparent concentration relationship for the 2- and 
4-mg dose levels on anaemia or neutropenia was observed.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Barcitinib’s blood-to-plasma ratio indicates weak/moderate association with the blood cell compartment. The 
volume of distribution indicates that baricitinib distributes from plasma compartment into tissue. 
In vitro data indicates that metabolism does not significantly contribute to the clearance of baricitinib. The 
enzymes involved in the limited metabolism of baricitinib were not identified, but this is also not warranted.  
The total clearance is ~17 L/h and the renal clearance is ~13.4 L/h in healthy subjects. These results indicate 
that baricitinib is actively excreted into urine. Baricitinib is mainly excreted via urine and predominately as 
parent. The transporters P-glycoprotein, OAT3 and MATE2-K are most likely involved in the active excretion 
of barcitinib into urine. 
BCRP may be involved in the excretion into faeces. However, excretion via faeces is limited (around 20%) 
and therefore the in vivo contribution of BCRP in to the excretion of baricitinib is most likely limited. This is 
most likely mainly unabsorbed baricitinib, since the bioavailability is ~79%. 
Genetic polymorphisms in P-glycoprotein will most likely not have a clinically relevant effect on the PK of 
baricitinib. For MATE-2K, a conclusion whether SNPs in MATE-2K would lead to clinically significant changes in 
the PK of baricitinib cannot de drawn as current information is too limited. However, the current proposed 
dose is 4 mg, but good response to a 2 mg dose was observed in non-renal patients. Therefore, a higher 
clearance of baricitinib due to the rs12943590 variant in MATE-2K will most likely not lead to a clinically 
relevant effect. There are currently no known SNPs in OAT3 affecting the activity and therefore no discussion 
is warranted for OAT3.  
A reduction in baricitinib renal clearance and an increase in the AUC were observed with increased severity of 
renal impairment. Dose reduction is therefore warranted for patients with renal impairment. A lower dose of 
2 mg is recommended for patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) between 30 and 
60 mL/min/1.73m2. Olumiant is not recommended for use in patients with estimated GFR of 
<30 mL/min/1.73m2. 
In patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, a less pronounced effect of the renal function on the exposure of 
baricitinib was observed. This is consistent with a reduced fraction of excretion out of the total elimination 
pathways of baricitinib in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis compared to healthy subjects. 
Gender and race (American versus Japanese) were shown to have an effect on the PK of baricitinib. However 
this was considered, to be due to differences in body weight and, not clinically relevant. 
Patients with severe hepatic impairment often have serious co-morbidities, which calls for caution when 
considering pharmacological treatment. Therefore, the use of baricitinib in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment is not recommended. 
It is unlikely that baricitinib will lead to clinically relevant DDIs due to CYP inhibition or induction. Baricitinib is 
not  an  inhibitor  of  the  transporters  P-glycoprotein,  BCRP,  OATP1B1,  OATP1B3,  OCT1,  OCT2,  OAT1,  OAT3, 
MATE-1 and MATE2-K at clinically relevant concentrations. Baricitinib may be an inhibitor of OCT1 at maximal 
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 57/132 
  
  
  
portal  vein  concentrations.  Concomitant  administration  of  baricitinib  with  drugs  for  which  the  rate  limiting 
step  is  hepatic  uptake  by  OCT1,  may  lead  to  an  increase  in  Cmax.  No  in  vivo  studies  were  performed  for 
inhibition of BCRP and MATE2-K. 
In  the  clinical  safety  studies,  an  effect  on  the  creatinine  clearance  was  observed  (decrease  in  creatinine 
clearance). Creatinine is cleared by the following transporters OCT2, OAT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K. Baricitinib 
was  not  an  inhibitor  of  OCT2,  MATE1  and  MATE2-K  at  clinically  relevant  concentrations.  The  Applicant  will 
investigate  if  inhibition  of  OAT2  by  baricitinib  may  be  the  cause  for  the  decrease  in  creatinine  clearance 
(Post-Authorisation Measure included in the RMP). 
Complete  inhibition  of  BCRP  may  lead  to  a  bioavailability  of  100%  which  may  result  in  an  AUC  increase  of 
1.25. This increase is not considered clinically relevant. Furthermore, the clinical significance of an interaction 
at  MATE2-K  would  be  minimised  given  the  multiple  exit  routes  of  baricitinib  from  the  proximal  tubule  cell. 
Maximal  inhibition  of  MATE-2K  will  lead  to  a  less  than  2-fold  increase  in  AUC  of  baricitinib,  because  other 
transporters can compensate for the lack of function. Therefore, inhibition of MATE-2K is likely not clinically 
relevant.  
Increase  in  gastric  pH  does  not  affect  the  overall  exposure  to  baricitinib.  Therefore,  baricitinib  may  be  co-
administered with drugs that are gastric pH modifying agents. 
In vitro and in vivo data indicate that >10% of the baricitinib dose is metabolised. Baricitinib is actively 
excreted by the transporters P-glycoprotein, BCRP, OAT3 and MATE2-K. In clinical DDI studies, the potential 
of other drugs to affect the PK of baricitinib was investigated. A clinically significant interaction was observed 
when baricitinib was co-administered with probenecid (a strong OAT3 inhibitor). No other clinical DDI studies 
have been conducted with OAT3 inhibitors with less inhibition potential. The prodrug leflunomide, which 
rapidly converts to teriflunomide and teriflunomide, is an inhibitor of OAT3 (furosemide exposure was 
increased in patients concomitantly taking teriflunomide and furosemide). Therefore, concomitant 
administration of baricitinib with leflunomide or teriflunomide may lead to an increase in baricitinib exposure. 
A recommendation for dose reduction of 2mg once daily in patients taking Organic Anion Transporter 3 
(OAT3) inhibitors with a strong inhibition potential, such as probenecid has been included in the SmPC. 
Concomitant use of ibuprofen and diclofenac will most likely have no clinically meaningful effect on the PK of 
baricitinib, since they are weak inhibitors of OAT3. Co-administration of ketoconazole (strong CYP3A 
inhibition), fluconazole (strong CYP2C19 inhibition and moderate CYP2C9 and 3A inhibition), rifampicin 
(inducer via CAR/PXR of among others CYP3A and P-glycoprotein) and cyclosporine (P-glycoprotein inhibition) 
with baricitinib did not have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of baricitinib. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The in-vitro studies suggest that baricitinib provides only a temporary suppression above the IC50 level of 
the pSTAT pathways mediating IL-15, IL-21 IL-6 signalling during a dosing interval.  
It could be questioned whether efficacy would be sufficient considering the short-term suppression of the 
target pathways by baricitinib during the dose interval. As will be discussed below, efficacy was established 
with 2 or 4 mg baricitinib once daily schedule. Twice daily dosing of 2 mg did not improve efficacy as 
compared to once-daily 4 mg, though it did lead to more adverse events like anaemia (see exploratory dose 
finding studies). 
IL-6  plays  a  relevant  role  in  fighting  infection.  According  to  the  data  provided,  once-daily  administration  of 
baricitinib may allow for recovery of the IL-6 signalling pathway towards the end of the dosing interval which 
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 58/132 
  
  
  
might  reduce  the  incidence  of  infections  that  have  been  reported  for  tocilizumab,  a  monoclonal  antibody 
causing a prolonged suppression of IL-6. 
However, as direct comparisons between baricitinib and longer acting drugs tocilizumab and tofacitinib are 
lacking, no final conclusions could be drawn from these in-vitro data, which were mainly based on 
simulations.  
Data from healthy volunteers without inflammation were requested from the applicant to evaluate whether 
the lipid-increments in patients receiving baricitinib are rather secondary to a non-specific reduction of 
inflammation by baricitinib–since other DMARDs also increase lipids-, or whether this a specific drug-related 
effect. Though no changes in cholesterol levels were observed in healthy volunteers who received a once 
daily dose, the data may not fully exclude an drug-related effect, since an increasing trend was observed in 
healthy volunteers who received a 5 mg twice-daily dose –and thus has a more prolonged STAT suppression 
during the day.  
It is not fully clear whether the increments of lipids that were observed in the clinical trials in RA patients, are 
directly  related to the  drug,  or  to  the  fact  that  RA patients in  high  active  disease  state  may  have  relatively 
low  cholesterol  level,  which  recovers  once  inflammation  is  treated  by  DMARDs.  In  healthy  volunteers,  no 
changes  in  total  cholesterol  were  noted  as  a  single  daily  dosing,  though  a  increment  of  cholesterol  is  not 
excluded at twice daily dosing. 
Altogether, the exposure to baricitinib in healthy volunteers is too limited to draw final conclusions whether 
the lipid effects of baricitinib in patients, are drug-related or should be considered as a treatment response, 
secondary to the reduction of inflammation.  At present, no further investigations are required regarding the 
underlying mechanism of hyperlipidaemia, also considering that lipid increments will be further followed in a 
PASS. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK of baricitinib has been extensively investigated both in vitro and in vivo. Baricitinib is mainly renally 
cleared  from  the  body,  and  dose  adjustments  are  recommended  in  the  SmPC  for  patients  with  moderate 
renal  impairment  which  is  acceptable.  With  regard  to  drug-drug  interactions  and  the  observed  decrease  in 
creatinine  clearance,  a  PAM  (outlined  in  the  RMP)  has  been  requested  to  investigate  if  baricitinib  may  be 
considered as an OAT2 inhibitor .  
Baricitinib  could  interfere  with  production  of  erythrocytes,  leukocytes,  or  platelets,  besides  the  warranted 
immune-modulating  effect  on  the  cytokines.  PK-PD  modelling  indicate  that  at  doses  of  4  mg  QD,  more 
patients  are  likely  to  achieve  the  plateau  of  the  exposure-response  curve  than  at  the  2  mg  dose,  without 
further increments of leukopenia or anaemia.  
Baricitinib has only a temporary inhibitory effect of the pSTAT pathways of IL 6, IL-15 and IL-21 above IC50 
during the dose interval of 24 hrs. This is in contrast to tofacitinib and tocilizumab, which have a continuous 
suppressing effect above IC50. The clinical relevance of these findings regarding efficacy or the risks of 
infections has not been established in head-to-head comparative trials.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The Phase II study program consisted of 3 proof-of-concept and dose finding studies, where doses of 1-10 
mg QD (once-daily) of baricitinib were explored. In Study JADA, also 2mg BID (twice daily) dosing was 
explored. Study JADN was performed in Japan, as a bridging study for non-Asian studies. 
Results of the proof-of-concept Study JADC in patients, in which 3 dose levels were evaluated (4-, 7- and 10-
mg  once  daily),  indicated  that  baricitinib  4-mg  once  daily  appeared  to  reside  on  the  plateau  of  the  efficacy 
dose-response curve. The percentage of subjects achieving ACR20 improvement at 12 weeks was 52%, 59%, 
and 53% for the 4 mg, 7 mg and 10 mg groups, respectively, and 32% for placebo. ACR50 responses were 
35%, 31% and 30%, respectively, and 13% for placebo. As the active treatment deterred from placebo, the 
proof of concept has been shown in this study.  
The primary reason for early discontinuation was adverse event, with a higher incidence of discontinuation in 
the BARI 10 mg group (15.6%) than in the lower dose group groups (6.3-9.4%) or placebo (6.5%). JAK1,2 
interfere  with  erythropoietin.  The  Haemoglobin  levels  dropped  in  a  dose  dependent  way:  the  mean  from 
baseline to Week 12 were -2.4, -4.9, and -11.1 g/L in the 4 mg, 7 mg, and 10 mg groups, compared with 0 
in the placebo group. In Study JADA and JADN, it was further confirmed that doses exceeding BARI 4 mg had 
no additional value, neither at the short as long-term (52 weeks, Study JADN).  
In study JADA and JADN, also doses lower than baricitinib 4 mg were evaluated. In Study JADA, the ACR20 
response rates at Week 12 were of 41% for placebo, 54% for the 2 mg dose, and 75% for the 4-mg dose. 
Twice-daily  2  mg  dosing  did  not  improve  efficacy  parameters  after  randomisation  from 4  mg  dose,  but was 
associated with more laboratory abnormalities.  
In  a  sub-study  of  154  enrolled  patients,  MRI  of  the  hand  and  wrist  was  performed.  Compared  to  placebo, 
statistically significant improvements in measures including synovitis, osteitis, and total inflammation scores 
were  observed  for  the  baricitinib  4-mg  and  8-mg  groups  at  Week  12;  no  statistically  significant 
improvements were 2-mg once daily group. In contrast, in Study JADN, both the 2 and 4 mg dose performed 
equally well for ACR50.  
The 4 mg dose was chosen for the Phase 3 trials. A lower 2-mg once daily dose was included in two Phase 3 
studies to confirm the minimum clinically effective dose.  
2.5.2.  Main studies 
To  confirm  efficacy  and  safety  in  the  three  target  populations  (DMARD-naïve  (first  line),  patients 
irresponsive/intolerant  to  convention  DMARDs  (second  line),  and  patients  irresponsive  to  biologic  DMARDs 
(‘third’ line), in total 4 main double-blind randomised controlled trials were performed.  
Two  trials  were  long-term  (52  weeks)  active  controlled  trials:  Study  JADZ,  which  was  performed  in  DMARD 
naïve  patients,  and  study  JADV,  which  was  performed  in  patients  irresponsive  to  methotrexate  (MTX-IR). 
Active comparator was MTX in the first line study, and TNF-I adalimumab in the second line study.  
Two trials were shorter-term (24 weeks) 3-arm randomised placebo-controlled trials with baricitinib 2 and 4 
mg. One was performed in the second line setting (Study JADX), and one in bDMARDs irresponsive patients 
(Study JADW, 3rd line).  
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 60/132 
  
  
  
All  patients  who  finished  Study  JADA,  JADZ,  JADV,  JADX,  JADW  could  enter  the  long-term  extension  study 
JADY.  Patients  could  maintain  their  prior  baricitinib  2  or  4  mg  dose.  Study  JADY  was  single-blind.  In  a 
subgroup of patients in JADY who were stable DAS28-hsCRP LDA responders on a 4 mg dose, a randomised 
withdrawal  study  was  performed.  Subjects  were  re-randomised to either  the  2  mg  dose,  or  maintenance  of 
the 4 mg dose.  
Study JADA, JADZ, JADV, JADX JADW, and JADY were considered as being pivotal for this application.

Endpoints  
In all pivotal trials, ACR 20 is the primary endpoint, at Week 12 or 24 (Study JADZ). The ACR20 is defined as 
at least 20% improvement in the following ACR Core Set values: 
• 
Tender joint count (68 joint count) 
•  Swollen joint count (66 joint count) 
•  An improvement of at least 20% in at least 3 of the following 5 assessments: 
o  Patient’s assessment of pain (VAS) 
o  Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity (VAS) 
o  Physician’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity (VAS) 
o  Patient’s assessment of physical function as measured by the HAQ-DI 
o  Acute phase reactant as measured by hsCRP. 
Key secondary efficacy endpoints:  
-Mean change from BL of the Health Assessment Questionnaire–Disability Index (HAQ-DI): a functional 
score. 
-Mean change from BL of the van der Heijde Modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS); this score sums the extent 
of bone erosions and joint space narrowing for 44 and 42 joints, of the hands/wrists and feet, by Xray, with 
higher scores representing greater damage. Central readers assessed the X-rays.  
-Mean change from BL of the DAS28-hsCRP and DAS28-ESR: measure of disease activity in 28 joints that 
consists of a composite numeric score of the following variables: tender joint count, swollen joint count, 
hsCRP or ESR, and Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity.  
-Remission according to SDAI. The SDAI is a tool for measurement of disease activity in RA that integrates 
measures of physical examination, acute phase response, patient self-assessment, and evaluator 
assessment. The ACR/EULAR index-based definition of remission is an SDAI score of ≤3.3.  
In Study JADV and JADX, patients’ reported outcomes like Duration of Morning Joint Stiffness, Severity of 
Morning Joint Stiffness Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), Tiredness Severity Numeric Rating Scale (Worst 
Tiredness NRS), Pain Severity Numeric Rating Scale (Worst Joint Pain NRS) were key secondary.  
Other Secondary endpoints:  
DAS28-hsCRP and DAS28-ESR LDA and remission For the DAS28-ESR, remission is defined as DAS28-
ESR<2.6 and LDA is defined as DAS28-ESR ≤3.2. Similar thresholds have also been used for DAS28-hsCRP 
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 62/132 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI): The CDAI is similar to the SDAI, but it does not use a laboratory 
result. Remission is defined as a CDAI score of ≤2.8. Low disease activity is defined as a CDAI score of 
≤10.0. 
ACR-EULAR Boolean Remission: All 4 criteria below must be met: Tender joint count 28 ≤1, Swollen joint 
count 28 ≤1, hsCRP ≤1 mg/dL (10 mg/L), Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity (on a 0 to 10.0 cm 
VAS) ≤1. 
Statistical methods 
Analyses were conducted using the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) analysis set, which is defined as all 
randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug.  
Categorical endpoints were analysed using logistic regression with NRI (non-responder imputation) for 
missing data. Key secondary continuous endpoints were analysed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with 
modified baseline observation carried forward (mBOCF) imputation.  
Mean change in mTSS was analysed using ANCOVA with linear extrapolation as the principal method of 
imputation. Sensitivity analyses were performed with LOCF.  
In each of the Phase 3 studies, the primary and key secondary hypotheses were tested using multiple testing 
procedures that control familywise type I error rate - referred to as “major (gated) objectives”.  
Each procedure began with a test of the primary null hypothesis using 2-sided alpha =0.05 if superiority was 
aimed (or 1-sided alpha =0.025 when non-inferiority was the primary assessment). Following rejection of the 
primary null hypothesis, the testing procedures used across the studies, though different from each other, fit 
within the framework of sequentially rejective weighted Bonferroni tests. In such a testing procedure defined 
by a graphical scheme, each time a hypothesis was rejected, the graphical scheme was updated according to 
predefined rules to reallocate alpha from this hypothesis to the remaining ones. This iterative process of 
updating the graphical scheme and reallocating alpha was repeated until either all hypotheses were tested or 
no remaining hypotheses could be rejected at their corresponding alpha levels.  
DMARD-naïve patients, Study JADZ (first-line) 
Study JADZ was a 52-week, multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group, study 
evaluating efficacy (signs and symptoms, physical function, PROs, and radiographic progression of structural 
joint damage) and safety in 588 patients with moderately to severely active early RA, who had limited or no 
prior treatment with MTX, and who were otherwise naive to cDMARD or biologic therapy.  
The treatment groups were: 
-  4-mg once-daily baricitinib as monotherapy 
-  MTX as monotherapy (escalated to a maximum dose of 20-mg once weekly) 
-  4-mg  once-daily  baricitinib  in  combination  with  MTX  (escalated  to  a  maximum  dose  of  20-mg  once 
weekly). 
The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of baricitinib monotherapy to MTX monotherapy in 
the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response rate at Week 24.  
The pre-specified NI margin was +/-12% of the 95% CI of for the response rate difference between BARI 
monotherapy minus MTX monotherapy at Week 24. 
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 63/132 
  
  
  
Results Study JADZ (DMARD-naïve) 
Though non-inferiority was aimed, superiority was shown for the primary analyses ACR20 for baricitinib alone 
or the combination BARI + MTX versus MTX alone. This was further supported by ACR 50 and ACR70 
responder rates (see figure 13 below).  
More importantly, superiority of remission responders according to the diverse disease activity scores 
(DAS28-hsCRP, DAS28-ESR, SLAI, CDAI) was achieved, even for the most critical one, i.e. Boolean remission 
(Week 24: MTX alone: 8.6%; BARI 4 mg: 16.3% (95% CI difference vs MTX: 1.5-13.9); BARI + MTX 18.9% 
(3.1-17.5). The effect was maintained till 52 weeks (figure 14). Remission was similar between baricitinib 
monotherapy and the combination.  
The primary endpoint was supported by a significant improvement of function (HAQ-DI), and Patient 
Reported Outcomes (PRO’s).  
Structural prevention was superior for the combination towards MTX monotherapy. However, the decline of 
structural mTSS scores, which were overall small from baseline, was similar between baricitinib and MTX 
monotherapies.

Figure 14.  Mean DAS28-hsCRP levels through Week 52 in Study JADZ. DMARD naïve patients (1st line)
MTX-IR patients (Study JADV, second line) 
Study JADV was a 52-week, Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel-
group, outpatient study evaluating efficacy and safety in 1307 patients who had an inadequate response to 
MTX, and who had evidence of bone/joint erosion. Patients were required to continue stable doses of 
concomitant MTX during the study.  
The treatment groups, as add-on therapy to stable MTX, were: 
•  4-mg once-daily baricitinib (52 weeks) 
• 
Placebo (24 weeks) 
•  40-mg adalimumab administered subcutaneously every 2 weeks (ADA) (52 weeks) 
Results Study JADV (second line, MTX-IR, active-controlled) 
Superiority of BARI 4 mg was shown to both placebo and ADA in the primary analyses, whereas non-
inferiority was aimed. ACR20 at Week 12 was 69.6% for BARI 4 mg, 61.2% for ADA, and 40.2% for placebo 
(difference vs. placebo 29.4 (95% CI 23.5, 35.4), vs. ADA (8.4 (1.7, 15.1). Superiority towards placebo and 
adalimumab was further confirmed for more stringent endpoints ACR50 and ACR70, and the effect was 
maintained till Week 52 (figure 15 and 16).  
Low Disease Activity (LDA) responder rates and physical function scores of BARI 4 mg were superior to 
adalimumab at Week 52. . Though not formally tested, non-inferiority between BARI 4 mg and ADA was 
shown for the other endpoints regarding remission, the prevention of radiographic progression within ranges 
of -/+ 12% at Week 24 and 52. FACIT-F (fatigue), EQ-5D-5L (QOL), joint pain and morning joint stiffness 
scores were more favourable for baricitinib as compared to adalimumab (p< 0.01).

Study JADX was a 24-week, Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study evaluating efficacy 
and safety in 684 patients with moderately to severely active RA despite previous or current treatment with 
cDMARDs. Patients in this study were allowed to continue cDMARD therapy during the study –if present.  
The treatment groups were: 
•  4-mg once-daily baricitinib (24 weeks) 
•  2-mg once-daily baricitinib (24 weeks) 
• 
Placebo (24 weeks)

Results Study JADX (2nd line dose finding) 
Both the 2-mg and 4-mg once daily doses of baricitinib demonstrated significant and clinically relevant 
improvements versus placebo with respect to signs and symptoms (ACR20/50/70), LDA and remission, 
physical function, and PROs (including morning joint stiffness, fatigue, pain, SF-36 PCS, and EQ-5D-5L). In 
contrast to what was observed in the Phase 2 studies, the outcomes for the 2 and 4 mg dose were highly 
similar for these endpoints. The primary endpoint of ACR20 response at Week 12 was 61.7% for BARI 4 mg, 
65.9% for BARI 2 mg, and 39.5% for placebo (differences 22.2% (13.2, 31.2) and 26.5% (17.6, 35.3) for 
the 4 and 2 mg dose vs placebo, respectively. 
Figure 17.  ACR responders for Study JADX: cDMARD-IR patients (2nd-line); dose finding 
Only an effect on the prevention of structural damage was more robustly shown for the 4 mg dose than the 2 
mg dose. In the primary analyses of the mTSS scores, where linear imputation was used for missing data, 
both the 2 and 4 mg separated from placebo (see figure 18 below). However, in sensitivity analyses using 
more a conservative LOCF imputation, the placebo effect shrunk, and the 2 mg dose arm –and not the 4 mg- 
failed to distinguish from placebo.

Linear Extrapolation Methoda
As Randomized with LOCF Imputationb
a Missing or post-rescue data imputed using linear extrapolation.
b Patients were allocated to the treatment group to which they were assigned at 
randomization regardless of rescue status.  Data missing at Week 24 were imputed using last 
observation carried forward (LOCF).
A subgroup of cDMARD intolerant patients (N=48) received no background cDMARD, thus constituting a 
monotherapy experiment. Improvements in this subgroup were consistent with those seen in the overall 
study sample. 
Biologic DMARD-IR patients (Study JADW, dose finding, third line) 
Study JADW was a 24-week, Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel-
group, study evaluating efficacy and safety in 527 patients with moderately to severely active RA despite 
past treatment with one or more biologics, including at least one TNF inhibitor. Patients in this study were 
required to continue stable doses of their current treatment with cDMARDs.  
The treatment groups were as follows: 
•  4-mg once-daily baricitinib (24 weeks) 
•  2-mg once-daily baricitinib (24 weeks) 
• 
Placebo (24 weeks) 
Results Study JADW (dose finding, b-DMARD-IR patients) 
In the analyses, Study JADW met its primary objective (ACR20) and the first two major secondary objectives 
(HAQ-DI and DAS28-hsCRP change from baseline) for baricitinib 4-mg versus placebo. According to the prior 
defined multiplicity testing rules, the analyses were stopped thereafter, as no statistical significance was 
observed for the next major (gated) endpoint, namely remission based on the SDAI (≤3.3) at Week 12. 
However, at other time-points, statistically significant improvements in this measure were demonstrated (see 
figure 20), as well as other measures of remission and low disease activity (CDAI ≤10; DAS28 ≤3.2; DAS28 
<2.6).  
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 68/132 
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
Ignoring multiplicity rules, the response of the primary endpoint ACR20 at Week 12 was 55.4% for BARI 4 
mg, 48.9% for BARI 2 mg and 27.3% for placebo (difference BARI 4 mg vs placebo: 28.1% (95% CI 18.2, 
37.9), BARI 2 mg vs placebo 21.6 (11.7, 31.5). Overall, the outcomes were more robust for the 4 than the 2 
mg dose regarding ACR50 and the diverse LDA scores (e.g. LDA according to DAS28-hsCRP: 31.6 for the 4 
mg dose, 24.9 for the 2 mg does and 9.1 for placebo). 
Boolean and CDAI remission response were not achieved for either dose (see Table 27 and 28 below)

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Subgroup analyses were performed for pooled analyses for the four main trials. No relevant trends were 
observed for gender, age groups, race, disease duration, and baseline disease activity (cut-off DAS28-hsCRP 
5.1).  
In  a  subgroup  of  elderly  >  65  years  of  age,  who  were  irresponsive  to  bDMARDs,  showed  an  increased 
incidence  of  h.  zoster  in  a  dose  dependent  way  (see  Safety  section  below).  In  this  special  group,  the 
possibility of dose reduction was explored. However, the response of to the 2 mg dose for endpoints of LDA 
and remission was reduced by 50% as compared to the 4 mg dose.  
A lower response for patients with bodyweight > 100 kg (8.8% of the study population) and/or high BMI was 
observed, including LDA and HAQ-DI endpoints. E.g. the OR to obtain a Low Disease Activity (DAS28-CRP 
<3.2) response versus placebo was 6.56 for patients with low body weight (< 60 kg), 3.75 for patients with 
intermediate BW (≥60 and <100), and 2.32 for patients with high bodyweight (≥100 kg). 
This can only partly be explained by a reduced plasma levels at higher bodyweight, since the reduction in 
plasma exposure were marginal in the heavy-weights. Also patients with a high bodyweight achieving the 
target PK levels still responded less than the general population. It was also noted that patients with a high 
body weight had higher disease activity at baseline. Considering the risks of higher baricitinib doses, and as 
lower plasma levels only explained to small extent the attenuated response in this subgroup, it was 
concluded that no dose adjustment are required for this population.  
Furthermore, a lower treatment response was observed in patients who were sero-negative for both RF and 
ACPA –about 8% of the total population. This is in line with RA studies for other products.

Clinical studies in special populations 
There were no dedicated dose response or phase III clinical trials in special populations 
Supportive studies 
All subjects finishing the main clinical trials could continue baricitinib treatment in the long-term extension 
Study JADY. In this study the possibility of a low 2 mg maintenance dose was explored in a subset of 293 
patients, who achieved sustained Low Disease Activity after at least 15 months of treatment (randomised 
withdrawal). 
After 12 weeks, 93% of patients continuing with 4 mg versus 84% of the patients stepping down to 2 mg, 
maintained Low Disease Activity level (p = 0.03). Maintenance of efficacy of the 4 mg dose was further 
established by the study. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In general, the study populations are considered representative for the target population of moderate-severe 
RA patients.  
Two of the main studies were active-controlled: Study JADZ in naïve-patients (active control MTX), and Study 
JADY in patients irresponsive to MTX (active control adalimumab).  Study JADX and JADW were placebo-
controlled studies with baricitinib 2 and 4 mg as parallel arms.   
General comments on the main studies (JADZ, JADY, JADX, JADW) 
The primary endpoint, ACR20, representing a change from baseline of signs of symptoms of 20% or more, is 
considered a low target, taking in consideration that efficacious DMARDs are available. The placebo response 
was high for this endpoint, indicating it is less sensitive to distinct a treatment effect. A change of 20% may 
in fact be a small absolute effect in patients with moderate active disease state at baseline. The current draft 
EMA guideline proposed target disease activity endpoints such as remission and LDA, as primary endpoint, 
since the clinical relevance of these outcomes is clearer than relative changes from BL. Remission and LDA 
scores will therefore be taken into account in the B/R assessment. Since LDA and remission scores met their 
endpoints throughout the studies, no questions are raised regarding the choice of the primary endpoint.  
It has been reported that for DMARDs targeting acute phase reactants, such as baricitinib, DAS28-CRP may 
overestimate clinical response, and that there may be silent residual inflammation in the joints even though 
CRP is low. In the analyses, also responder analyses by SDAI and CDAI scores were included, which are less 
influenced  by  CRP.  In  general,  the  conclusions  for  the  DAS28-CRP  outcomes of  LDA  (Low  Disease  Activity), 
were  congruent  with  LDA  estimates  using  SDAI/CDAI.  However,  DAS28  remission  rates  were  indeed  higher 
for DAS28-CRP, the SDAI (and Boolean remission by ACR-EULAR) was more conservative.  
It is noted that a large number of outcomes were evaluated, which were either closely related or overlapping. 
E.g. remission was calculated by SDAI, CDAI, DAS28-ESR, DAS28-hsCRP, and according to ACR-EULAR 
Boolean score. It is therefore supported that multiplicity was addressed in the statistical analyses by following 
a pre-defined order of key-secondary (gated) endpoints and correction of the alpha.  
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 82/132 
  
  
  
Non Responder Imputation (NRI) was applied for missing data of responder outcomes, which is supported. 
BOCF was applied for key secondary continuous endpoints, which is in general considered sufficiently 
conservative.  
The outcomes of the radiographic mTSS scores, however, were largely influenced by the used method of 
imputation. Linear extrapolation increased the mTSS (modified Total Sharp Score) in the placebo arm 
significantly more than the active treatments, thereby inflating the treatment effect. The secondary 
imputation by LOCF does not accurately reflect the natural course of decline, and may have been too 
conservative for estimating placebo-response. Post-hoc sensitivity analyses with multiple, imputation 
methods by the placebo-response supported the conclusions of the LOCF analyses, i.e. that the response to 
the 4 mg dose was more robust that the 2 mg dose. 
Study JADZ 
MTX  monotherapy  may  not  be  considered  as  an  optimal  comparator  for  naïve  patients.  As  MTX  has  to  be 
gradually up titrated, it is recommended to commence MTX therapy together with other synthetic DMARDS or 
low  dose  corticosteroids,  to  achieve  a  more  rapid  onset  of  effect,  according  to  EULAR  treatment 
recommendations of 2013. This may favoured the baricitinib treatment effect.  
No  placebo  was  included  in  active-controlled  Study  JADZ,  which  hampers  assessment  of  assay  sensitivity. 
Assay  sensitivity,  however,  could  be  considered  as  established  since  baricitinib  was  superior  to  the  active 
control MTX monotherapy, which is considered as standard first-choice treatment option in RA.  
Study JADV 
The  choice  of  the  active  comparator  adalimumab  in  MTX-irresponsive  patients,  is  considered  adequate. The 
52 weeks duration of the controlled phase provides sufficient insight in maintenance of efficacy.  
Study JADW (patients with an inadequate response to biologic DMARDs) 
As  a  general  rule in  RA  studies,  add-on  studies  are performed in  patients  failing  on  prior DMARDS,  thereby 
continuing  the  prior  treatments.  In  the  study  in  bDMARD-IR  patients  (JADW),  prior  biologic  DMARDs  were 
discontinued.  This  is  understood  from  a  safety  perspective,  since  the  consequences  of  inhibiting  multiple 
immune-modulatory  pathways  by  a  combination  of  baricitinib  +  bDMARDs  may  be  serious.  From  a 
methodological perspective, it would have been preferred if prior bDMARDs were still continued in the placebo 
arm, as patients may remain partially responsive. Thus, the active treatment arms (baricitinib 2 and 4 mg) 
may have been favoured as compared to placebo by withdrawal of prior biological DMARDS. However, since 
the  response  to  baricitinib  was  overall  robust  and  clearly  distinguished  from  placebo  in  a  dose-dependent 
way, the treatment effect is considered relevant and not much inflated.  
However, remission according to SDAI is a high hurdle target, with responder rate of less than 10% at active 
treatment across studies. Retrospectively, it may not have been a realistic goal for this population of patients 
irresponsive to one or multiple biologics, which is, in general, only prescribed after the patient failed on 
multiple synthetic DMARDs 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Efficacy has been robustly demonstrated to a clinically relevant extent, showing superiority of relevant 
outcomes, remission and LDA towards standard care of MTX or adalimumab. The primary endpoints were 
supported by remission or LDA responder outcomes, an improvement of physical functioning (HAQ-DI), 
fatigue, morning stiffness and diverse PRO and QOL scales, highlighting the consistency of the results. 
EMA/13493/2017

Prevention of structural damage has been established as well. Maintenance of efficacy has been 
demonstrated in the 52-weeks active-controlled trials, and in the randomised withdrawal study JADY.  
For  Study  JADZ,  in  DMARD-naïve  patients,  the  primary  response  of  ACR20  was  76.7%  for  baricitinib 
monotherapy, 78.1% for the combination, and 61.9% for MTX alone (BARI monotherapy vs MTX: difference 
14.8% (95% CI 5.5, 24.1), BARI + MTX combination vs MTX alone: difference 16.2% (7.7, 24.8)). Remission 
(defined as DAS28-hsCRP<2.6) was achieved in 40.3% of the subjects treated with baricitinib monotherapy, 
40.5% for the combination, and 23.8% for MTX alone (BARI monotherapy vs MTX: 16.4% (6.9, 26.0), BARI 
+ MTX combination vs MTX: 16.7% (7.9, 25.4) , at Week 24). Also strict remission criteria according to ACR-
EULAR  (Boolean)  were  met  for  baricitinib+  MTX  combination  versus  monotherapy  (17%  vs  11.4%  MTX 
monotherapy,  difference  9.5%  (2.6,  16.4)  at  Week  52,  though  this  was  not  formally  met  for  baricitinib 
monotherapy.  Physical  function  (HAQ-DI  improvement  of  ≥0.3  points)  was  improved  for  baricitinib 
monotherapy  (77.4%)  and  the  combination  with  MTX  (74.4%),  versus  MTX  alone  (65.7%)  (difference  BARI 
monotherapy  vs.  MTX:  11.6  (2.5,  20.8),  BARI  +  MTX  combination  vs.  MTX:  8.7  (0.0,  17.4)).  Only  for  the 
combination  therapy  of  baricitinib  4  mg  +  MTX,  a  statistically  significant  improvement  was  shown  for  the 
percentage of subjects without any radiographic progression from baseline after 52 weeks, in comparison to 
MTX monotherapy (80% vs. 66%, difference 14.1% (6.1, 22.0)). For baricitinib monotherapy, this was 69%.  
In  Study  JADV,  in  patients  irresponsive  to  MTX,  ACR20  responder  rates  were  73.9%  for  baricitinib  4  mg, 
66.4%  for  active  comparator  adalimumab,  and  36.7%  for  placebo  (week  24)  (BARI  vs  Placebo  difference: 
37.2%  (31.5,  43.0),  BARI  vs  ADA:  7.6%  (1.1,  14.0)).  Whereas  non-inferiority  was  aimed,  superiority  was 
obtained  in  favour  of  baricitinib.  Also  the  Low  Disease  Activity  responder  rate  (DAS28-hsCRP  ≤  3.2)  of 
baricitinib  of  55.6%  was  superior  to  the  response  obtained  for  adalimumab  (48.2%),  though  to  marginal 
extent (difference: 7.5% (0.55-14.4)). Physical function, i.e. the percentages of patients with a considerable 
HAQ-DI  improvement  of  ≥0.3  points  from  baseline,  was  66.7%  for  baricitinib,  59.7%  for  adalimumab,  and 
37.1%  for  placebo  (BARI  vs  ADA:  difference  7%  (0.3,  13.8)).  Non-inferiority  was  established  between 
baricitinib  and  adalimumab  regarding  the  percentage  of  responders  without  radiographic  progression  (week 
52 difference -2.1% (-6.5, 2.3). Both baricitinib and adalimumab separated from placebo at Week 24 (81%, 
83% and 70%, respectively), indicating assay sensitivity for this endpoint.  
In  the  24-weeks  dose-finding  study  JADX  in  patients  irresponsive  or  intolerant  to  cDMARDs,  the  2  mg  dose 
performed  as  well  as  the  4  mg  dose  regarding  ACR  outcomes  and  LDA  or  remission  (e.g.  LDA  /remission 
rates  according  to  DAS28-hsCRP  were  46.3/30.6%  for  the  2  mg  dose,  51.5/33.0%  for  the  4  mg  dose,  and 
23.7/10.5%  for  placebo,  all  p-values  <  0.001).  In  this  short-term  study,  the  4  mg  dose  separated  from 
placebo  regarding  the percentage  of  patients  without  structural  bone  damage  over  the observational period 
of 24 weeks (80% vs 74% for placebo, difference 6.0% (95% CI 0.1-13.9)) , whereas this was not achieved 
for the 2 mg dose.  
A notable response was observed for baricitinib in patients who were irresponsive to one or multiple 
bDMARDs, even though it is an oral treatment. Primary ACR20 scores were similar between the two dosages 
tested. A higher response was obtained for the 4 mg dose than the 2 mg dose regarding more critical 
outcomes, like DAS28-hsCRP ≤ 3.2. Also outcomes that are not dependent on acute phase reactant CRP, 
such as CDAI, showed a robust effect in a dose dependent way. Furthermore, these endpoints of disease 
activity were supported by secondary outcomes like functional endpoints (HAQ-DI >=0.3). Subgroup 
analyses showed a relevant effect in patients irresponsive to multiple bDMARDs including a non-TNF-inhibitor 
drug.   
Long-term efficacy data (Study JADY)

Dose finding 
A 4 mg dose has been proposed as the standard dose, as at this dose level, a more robust response was 
shown regarding the prevention of structural bone damage in Study JADX, and higher remission rates were 
achieved for the 4 mg dose versus the 2 mg dose in the multi therapy resistant bDMARD-IR population 
(Study JADW).  
The  choice  of  4  mg  dose  as  standard  is  supported  from  a  clinical  efficacy  perspective.  From  a  safety 
perspective  the  low  dose  is  recommended  for  vulnerable  patients,  such  as  very  elderly,  and  patients  with 
recurrent infections. This is discussed further in the Benefit-Risk section.  
In sensitivity analyses, a diminished treatment effect of baricitinib was observed in heavy weight patients > 
100 kg. However, dose adjustments are not foreseen. It is agreed not to titrate the dose over 4 mg in heavy 
weight, for safety reasons (e.g. anaemia was more common at dosages > 4 mg in the Phase II study). 
Moreover, it is generally known that patients with high bodyweight are less responsive to DMARDs, possibly 
because of role of adipose tissue on inflammatory reactants.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, efficacy has been established for baricitinib, at a clinically relevant effect size. Barcitinib was superior 
in comparison to active comparator MTX in the first-line treatment setting in naïve patients with moderate-
severe RA, and in several aspects it was superior to adalimumab in patients irresponsive to MTX. 
Maintenance of efficacy has been shown. Baricitinib showed efficacy in patients who were irresponsive to 
multiple bDMARDs. The response to the 4 mg dose was overall more robust than to the 2 mg dose. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
A  total  of  3464  patients  were  exposed  to  baricitinib  in  RA  studies,  representing  4214.1 patient-years  of 
exposure  (PYE);  2166  patients  (62.5%)  were  exposed  for  ≥52  weeks,  and  467 patients  (13.5%)  were 
exposed for ≥104 weeks.  
An update of the safety data after the cut-off date of 15 August 2015 of the original dossier till 01 January 
2016 was provided in response to Day 120 LoQ, extending the total data to 5134.4 PY of 3492 subjects.  
Patients’ characteristics 
Demographics and disease stage are summarised in section 2.5.2 of this report.  
Regarding  co-morbidities,  a  DMARD-naïve  early  RA  study  population  had  less  CV  risk  factors  at  baseline  –
such as diabetes, hyperlipidaemia and hypertension- than the more treatment experience study populations 
(see Table 35 below). Only patients with stable prior CV disorders were included.

Adverse events from the primary analyses (16 weeks) were screened for possible ADRs (adverse drug 
reactions) by the Applicant, using the following criteria: 
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 86/132 
  
  
  
 
 
1)  Baricitinib 4-mg incidence ≥10%  
2)  A statistically significant positive dose relationship across the baricitinib treatment groups 
3)  Baricitinib 4-mg statistically significantly higher than placebo  
4)  The Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio is ≥2 for baricitinib 4-mg compared to placebo, and the baricitinib 
incidence is ≥1% 
Using these criteria, and clinical medical judgment, the following events were classified as ADR and reported 
in section 4.8 of the SmPC: nausea, upper respiratory tract infections, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, acne, 
increased creatine phosphokinase, increased LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, increased liver function tests 
(AST, ALT), neutropenia and thrombocytosis (see table 37 below).

Infections 
Through 24 weeks of treatment with data up to rescue, there was a statistically significant larger proportion 
of  patients  treated  with  BARI  4  mg  compared  to  placebo  with  infections  (36.3%  vs.  27.9%,  respectively, 
Odds Ratio 1.4 (95% CI 1.2-1.7), p < 0.001). There were no differences between BARI 4 mg and placebo in 
the proportion of patients with serious infections according to ICH criteria (1.5% vs 1.6%, respectively). The 
rate of infections moderately increased with the baricitinib dose (32.6% vs. 38.2% till Week 24, and 48.5% 
vs. 53.4% in the long-term extension phase of 52 weeks, for the 2 and 4 mg dose, respectively).  
The overall incidence of infections of baricitinib exceeded the active comparators, i.e. MTX in Study JADZ in 
DMARD-naïve patients and adalimumab in MTX-IR patients in study JADV, to modest extent by a difference of 
3-5%.  The  rate  of  infections  was  modestly  increased  for  patients  who  were  more  heavily  pre-treated  with 
DMARDs and other immune-modulating drugs than naïve patients (see Table 38). This was observed both for 
baricitinib, as the comparators and placebo. The difference versus placebo was similar (about 8%) over the 
different  study  populations  (DMARD-naïve,  conventional  DMARD-IR  (second  line),  and  biological  DMARD-IR 
patients ‘third’ line).  
At  longer term  follow-up,  the  incidence  rate  of  (serious)  infections  stabilised and  eventually  decreased (see 
figure 15 below).

Type of infections 
The most commonly reported infections were upper respiratory tract infections, herpes zoster and herpes 
simplex.  
Herpes zoster

In the pooled analyses of placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of herpes zoster for baricitinib 4 mg 
versus placebo was 1.8% vs 0.4% till Week 24 (Odds ratio 4.59 (95% CI 1.5, 13.6). The incidence of herpes 
zoster increased with the dose (see figure 16). The rate of HZ infections remained stable for 72 weeks and 
decreased thereafter. As compared to historic controls of other DMARDs, the point estimate for the incidence 
rate of herpes zoster of 3.4 per 100 PY as observed for baricitinib, appeared lower as described previously for 
tofacitinib (4.4-5.4 per 100 py), though higher than e.g tocilizumab (2.4 per 100 py). 
In DMARD-naïve subjects (Study JADZ), the risk of herpes zoster was overall low, but about twice as high for 
baricitinib as comparator MTX at Week 52 (MTX 1.0% [1.17 per 100 PY], BARI 4 mg: 2.5% [2.78], and BARI 
+ MTX: 2.3% [2.65]). However, the incidence rate of herpes zoster of baricitinib 4 mg was more aligned to 
active-control adalimumab in the second line treatment setting; 2.3% [2.5 per 100 PY] and 1.5% [1.8] at 
Week 52, for BARI 4 mg and ADA, respectively.  
More heavily pre-treated patients were more vulnerable. The highest incidence and background risk was 
observed in patients irresponsive to biologic DMARDS (Study JADW), especially at the 4 mg dose (4.0 % 
[9.55 per 100 py] at the BARI 4 mg dose, and 1.1% for 2 mg dose [2.86], which was the same as placebo 
(1.1% [3.04]).  
Of 141 reported cases, complicated or disseminated events were reported in 5 cases: 2 associated with facial 
palsy and 3 considered disseminated based on the pattern of dermatome involvement. About 14% was 
reported as SAE.

patient-years, respectively. See Table 39 below.

Other opportunistic infections 
Beyond herpes zoster and tuberculosis, ten potential opportunistic infections were reported including wound 
infection with coccidioides species (1 event), oesophageal candidiasis (5 events), pneumocystis pneumonia (3 
events) and blood beta-D-glucan increased (1 event). None of these cases could either be confirmed or were 
considered treatment related on review. The reported wound infection with coccidioides was considered a 
reporting error by the investigator. The case reports regarding –suspected- pneumocystis pneumonia came 
from Japanese sites, where beta-D-glucan values were routinely screened as a marker of invasive fungal 
infections.  
In the RA Phase 3 studies, approximately 8% of randomized patients at baseline were diagnosed with latent 
TB.  One  TB  case  was  reported  in  the  placebo/active  comparator  controlled  phase  in  Study  JADX,  for 
baricitinib  4  mg  at  Day  137.  According  to  the  Applicant,  a  protocol  violation  had  occurred  for  the  TB  case 
under baricitinib treatment, as sscreening IGRA of this subject was indeterminate, but no repeat or latent TB 
X-ray  was  performed.  Seven  other  cases  were  reported  for  baricitinib  4  mg  in  the  uncontrolled  extension 
phase, within the range of background risk.  
All patients were receiving other concomitant DMARDs, and 4 were receiving concomitant corticosteroids. All 
cases  occurred  in  area’s  where  TB  is  endemic  (Asia,  South-Africa,  Russia.  Argentina,).  The  overall  EAIR  of 
tuberculosis in RA patients treated with baricitinib 4-mg once daily was 0.20 events/100PY, which was lower 
than  compared  to  adalumimab  active  comparator  in  Study  JADV  (0.36  events/100  PY),  and  the  expected 
background risk in background risks 0.64 events/100 PY in the total population 
Patients with hepatitis B surface antibody and hepatitis B core antibody, without hepatitis B surface antigen, 
were  also  allowed  to  participate.  When  these  cases  were  tested  for  HBV  DNA,  a  similar  incidence  of  cases 
with  detectable  DNA  were  reported  for  baricitinib  and  adalimumab  (0.6%  in  52  weeks  for  both  active 
treatments), and no cases were reported for placebo (24 weeks). These cases were not considered as active 
hepatitis B infection as expression of HBV DNA was low.  
In  addition,  one  case  of  CMV  (Cytomegalovirus)  infection  and  a  single  case  of  Epstein-Barr  (EB)  virus 
infection was reported. Infections were of mild-moderate severity.  
Malignancies 
For  baricitinib  (all  doses,  pooled  dataset),  the  incidence  rate  of  malignancies  (without  NMSC)  was  38  cases 
and 0.73 per 100 py (95% CI 0.5, 1.0) (update 01-01-2016). There was no clear dose effect for baricitinib. 
For  pooled  data  of  the  comparators  placebo,  MTX  and  adalimumab,  the  incidence  rates  for  malignancies 
without  NMSC  were  0.18,  0.48,  and  0  per  100  py,  respectively  (see  Table  40).  As  the  comparator  groups 
were small and placebo was short, the incidence of malignancies in the comparator arms could not be reliably 
estimated.  
At longer term follow-up, the incidence rates of malignancies w.o. NMSC gradually increased from 0.47 within 
the first 24 weeks, till 1.17 per 100 PY in the observational period of 48-72 weeks (figure 17). Thereafter, the 
incidence  rates  appear  to stabilize,  though  this  was difficult  to establish  since the  confidence intervals  were 
wide.

Mama and digestive tract carcinoma were most frequently reported.  
Whereas in the original dossier three cases of lymphoma were reported, two additional cases emerged in the 
updated dataset. This results in an IR of 0.095 per 100 patient-years of exposure (PYE) (95% CI, 0.031, and 
0.223).  These  values  do  not  exceed  the  published  background  rates  from  clinical  trials  (0.02  to  0.21)  in 
patients  with  RA  with  concomitant  methotrexate  or  other  cDMARD)  therapy  (which  each  of  the  5  patients 
with  lymphoma  were  taking)  (0.04-0.16),  or  patients  with  RA  with  concomitant  anti–tumour  necrosis  factor 
therapy  (0.04-0.34)  .  EBV  (Epstein-Barr  virus)  was  confirmed  in  one  of  the  5  lymphoma  cases  (a  B-cell 
lymphoma in Asia, patients was pre-treated with MTX and prednisone). EBV status was confirmed negative in 
one T-cell lymphoma, or not reported in the other cases. One case was related to H.pylori infection (MALT).   
There was one case of lymphoproliferative disorders in elderly.  
The incidence rate of NMSC was 0.4 per 100 PY. The incidence rates remained stable over time (96 weeks). 
For other DMARDs, incidence rates of 0.17-0.69 per 100 PY had been reported.

Lipids 
Abnormal LDL-C (Low Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol) values, including categories of high or very high, were 
very common in both PBO (11.8%) and BARI 4-mg (10.5%) at baseline.  
Baricitinib  induced  a  significant  increment  of  LDL-C  and  HDL-C  from  baseline  within  the  first  12  weeks  of 
treatment, in a dose-dependent way, which remained stable thereafter. Overall, the LDL/HDL ratio remained 
unchanged after baricitinib treatment.

Figure 19.  Central tendency of LDL cholesterol 
The change in lipid was lower for comparator MTX in Study JADZ. Baricitinib 4 mg monotherapy cause a shift 
of LDL-C from normal to high in 17.4% of the subjects treated with baricitinib monotherapy, versus 5.3% in 
subjects  treated  with  MTX  alone.  In  general,  lipid  levels  increased  significantly  for  active  comparator 
adalimumab in Study JADV as compared to placebo, but to lesser extent than for baricitinib. E.g. LDL-C shifts 
(4.14 mmol/L) were reported for 10.0% for adalimumab, 24.4% for baricitinib 4 mg, versus 5.5% for placebo 
in  24  weeks.  Similar  rates  of  LDL-C  increments  as  observed  for  baricitinib  were  reported  for  Il-6  inhibitor 
tocilizumab. 
Statins  were  initiated  only  in  a  small  percentage  of  the  subjects  assigned  to  baricitinib  4  mg  (2,5-3.5  % 
within  24  weeks),  to  similar  extent  as  placebo.  The  effect  of  statin  therapy  was  comparable  between 
baricitinib and placebo arms. In only a few isolated cases of patients that were already treated with statins at 
baseline, the statin dose was increased. 
To  characterize  changes  in  lipids,  lipid  NMR  (Nuclear  Magnetic  Resonance)  scans  and  apolipoproteins  were 
examined. Significant increases in the number of large LDL-C particles and statistically significant decreases 
in  the  number  of  small,  medium-small  and  very  small  LDL-C  particles  were  observed  in  BARI  4-mg  and 
adalimumab as compared to PBO. Large LDL-C particles are considered less atherogenic than small ones.  
Baricitinib  was  also  associated  with  weight  gain.  In  pooled  analyses,  9.8%  of  the  subjects  treated  with 
baricitinib 4 mg, had more than 7% weight gain from baseline at Week 24, versus 2.8% for placebo (Odds 
Ration  3.6, 95%  CI  2.4,5.6).  The  proportion  of patients  reporting  weight gain  was  the  largest in  subgroups 
with low BMI at baseline. Also the waist circumference increased from baseline with 1-1.5 cm after 52 weeks 
of baricitinib treatment, versus 0.6 cm for MTX and 1.2 cm for adalimumab.

Cardiovascular risks 
Baricitinib  did  not  cause  a  change  in  blood  pressure.  No  signal  of  QTc  prolongation  was  observed  for 
baricitinib in a positive controlled study.  
For  the  baricitinib  Phase  3  studies,  an  independent  external  committee  was  established  to  adjudicate 
potential  cardiovascular  adverse  events.  MACE  was  defined  as  cardiovascular  death,  MI,  or  stroke. 
Cardiovascular  event  were  hospitalization  for  unstable  angina  or  heart  failure,  serious  arrhythmia, 
resuscitated sudden death, cardiogenic shock, or coronary revascularizations.  
The  incidence  rates  of  MACE  and  CV  events  were  overall  lower than  comparators  placebo  and  MTX,  though 
the point estimate was slightly lower for adalimumab. To be noted, the comparators’ arms were too small to 
draw definitive conclusions.

Renal safety 
Baricitinib  causes  a  steady  increment  of  creatinine  serum  levels  (mean  change  from  baseline:  6.2  µmol/L 
versus 1.1 for placebo, 95% CI of he difference 4.3, 6.0). This was reversible after treatment discontinuation. 
As serum creatinine increased, the GFR estimated based on creatinine, decreased accordingly. 
Baricitinib 4 mg was also explored in patients with diabetic nephropathy in Study JAGQ. Baricitinib in doses 
up  to  4  mg,  had  no  influence  on  eGFR  if  calculated  by  Cystatin  C.  Moreover,  baricitinib  improved  urine 
albumin loss in these nephropathy patients.  
The number of cases of renal SAEs was higher for placebo than baricitinib 4 mg in the pooled analyses.

Hepatic safety 
In  general,  baricitinib  induced  a  steady  increment  of  transferases  ALT  and  AST  that  continued  during 
treatment. Peak in ALT and AST exceeding ULN > 5 times were less than 1%, and were generally transient. 
In  contrast,  alkaline  phosphatase  steadily  declined  from  baseline.  Bilirubin  remained  stable  after  baricitinib 
treatment, and there were no hepatoxicity cases meeting Hy’s law for baricitinib.

Three case reports suspected of DILI (drug-induced liver injury) were reported. Formally, these cases did not 
meet Hy’s law criteria of DILI. None of them were reported to be treatment related. One case was thought to 
be due to cholecystitis, and one to alcohol use.  
One  case  of  jaundice  starting  two  days  after  baricitinib,  with  moderate  increments  of  bilirunine  (<  2  times 
ULN),  ALT  >3  and  <  times  ULN,  GGT  >10  times  ULN,  without  further  cause  like  hepatitis  or  alcohol  use, 
recovered spontaneously at discontinuation of baricitinib (positive de-challenge).  
GI perforations 
Two cases occurred during the extended treatment phase of the trials (one case of diverticular perforation 
after baricitinib for 242 days, and one case of ruptured appendicitis after baricitinib for 416 days). Both 
patients used corticosteroids. Overall, the frequency in the trial population [0.05 per 100 py] ls was below 
what is generally reported for RA patients [0.17 ], or tocilizumab and tofacitinib [0.13].

The  SAE  rates  were  similar  for  baricitinib  and  placebo,  and  with  heterogeneous  causes.  More  often  than 
placebo,  lab  abnormalities  were  reported  as  SAE.  More  injuries  (mainly  fractures)  were  reported  for 
baricitinib. These were not reported to be related to higher incidence of falls.

Laboratory findings 
Chemistry 
There were no notable changes in glucose, sodium, potassium, or Total Protein.  
Treatment with baricitinib was commonly associated with a rapid increase in Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) of 
80% from baseline values, which plateaued after approximately 12 weeks of treatment. Less than 15 cases 
(0.8%)  were  severe  increments  (>  5  x  ULN),  compared  to  0.2  for  placebo.  The  risk  of  high  CPK  value 
increased in patients with renal impairment at baseline. 
CPK  increment  was  not  clearly  associated  with  severe  muscle  pain.  Treatment-Emergent  Muscle  Symptoms 
were slightly more commonly reported for baricitinib 4 mg than Placebo (1.6 [5.5 per 100 PY] versus 1.1% 
[4.0], respectively).  
One  case  of  possible  rhabdomyolysis  was  reported  (rated  as  non-serious).  Causality  is  unclear  since  the 
patient had elevated CPK at baseline (778 U/L), and continued baricitinib treatment despite high CPK levels. 
The increment was considered to be attributed to heavy exercise by the Investigator.  
Table 48.  CPK central tendency (pooled data main studies) 
Haematology 
Because of its mode of action of baricitinib as a JAK inhibitor on the interruption of signalling of cytokines and 
growth 
factors  (EPO) 
involved 
in  regulation  of  haematopoiesis,  haematological  parameters  and 
myelosuppression were monitored throughout the studies.  
Anaemia: Haemoglobin, haematocrit 
Baricitinib  4  mg  induced  an  overall  small  decline  of  haemoglobin  (Hb),  haematocrit  (Ht)  and  erythrocytes 
counts from baseline. Mean difference of change of Hb from baseline for the 4 mg dose was 0.05 mmol/mL 
(95%  CI  -0.01-0.1,  equivalent  to  0.016-0.16  g/dL),  as  compared  to  placebo  treatment.  The  effects  of 
baricitinib 2 and 4 mg were similar. Compared to placebo, the rate of low haemoglobin (defined as < 12 g/dL 
for females and 13.5 g/dL for males) was 27.5% for baricitinib 4mg versus 24.5% for placebo (pooled data 
primary  safety  analysis,  16  weeks).  A  drop  of  Hb  <8  g/dL  (≥3  CTCAE  Hb  values)  was  rare  (<0.5%),  and 
occurred at similar rates as compared to placebo or MTX-monotherapy.  
The  initial  decrease  of  Hb  and  erythrocytes  was  associated  with  increased  reticulocytes  counts,  indicating 
compensatory mechanism, and Hb returned to baseline levels after 24 weeks. In total 4 subjects interrupted 
baricitinib treatment because of anaemia (out of 3822 treated with baricitinib). In the patients who interrupt 
treatment because of anaemia, Hb was reversible towards baseline within 28 days (i.e. the scheduled interim 
visit period).

Platelets 
Baricitinib caused a short lasting increment of platelets. These were not related to venous thrombosis events.  
Leukocytes 
Mean  leukocyte  counts,  and  specifically  neutrophil  counts,  dropped  from  baseline  shortly  after  the  start  of 
baricitinib  treatment,  in  a  dose  dependent  way.  Grade  3  neutropenia  (<  1.0  billion  cells  /L)  was  rarely 
reported (0.3% in baricitinib 4 mg dose).  
Table 49.  Neutrophil counts 
NK cells 
NK cells increased in the first two weeks, but then dropped by 20% from baseline and slowly recovered near 
baseline levels at Week 52. Similar effects were reported for MTX.  
Lymphocytes 
Overall,  administration  of  baricitinib  was  associated  with  an  increase  in  mean  lymphocyte  counts  within  1 
week  of  starting  treatment;  values  declined  to  baseline  by  12  to  24  weeks  and  remained  stable.  Grade  3 
lymphopenia (<0.5 billion cells /L) was reported in 1.9% of all RA patients exposed to baricitinib 4 mg, which 
is within the ranges as reported for placebo or MTX. There was a weak relationship between lymphopenia and 
infections.  
Lymphocyte subsets were analysed throughout the confirmatory trials. B-cells (CD19+/CD20+ and mature 
naïve cells) increased by about 70-100%. To be noted, gamma globulins slightly decreased with baricitinib, 
which might be considered as a treatment response of inflammation. Align with the increments of the total 
lymphocyte counts, CD3+, CD4+, and to lesser extent CD8+, increased from baseline till Week 24. After 
that, CD3/4/8 levels gradually retuned to baseline.  There was a marginal decrease in T-helper cells. 
Safety in special populations 
Females 
Amenorrhoea  was  reported  more  frequently  for  baricitinib  than  placebo  up  to  24  weeks  (1.5  per  100  py 
versus 0.3 per 100 py), in studies where baricitnib was given add-on to MTX.  
Elderly 
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 104/132 
  
  
  
 
The  baricitinib  RA  programme  included  605  patients  who  were  65  years  of  age  and  older,  77  patients  who 
were 75 years and older, and 1 patient above 85 years of age. 
Infections were reported more often for elderly as compared to younger subjects, but a similar tendency was 
noted for the placebo-arm. In elderly > 65 years who were heavily pre-treated with prior biologics, there was 
a  dose  dependent  risk  of  h.  zoster.  However,  a  dose-dependent  tendency  was  not  confirmed  in  elderly 
treated with synthetic DMARDs only (see table 50 below).   
Table 50.  Occurrence  of  Treatment  Emergent  Herpes  Zoster 
in  cDMARD-IR  and  bDMARD  IR 
Subpopulations of Patients Aged ≥ 65 Years 
Anaemia was more frequently reported for elderly >75 years (40% for baricitinib versus 11% placebo). 
Renal impairment 
As baricitinib is predominantly cleared by the kidney, a lower dose of 2 mg is recommended for patients with 
renal  impairment.  It  is  noted  that  patients  with  mild-moderate  renal  impairment  at  baseline,  had  a  higher 
risk of anaemia (29.6 % for BARI 4 mg and 21.8% for placebo).  
Immunological events 
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 105/132 
  
  
  
 
 
 
There was no clear signal of hypersensitivity reactions or photosensitivity reactions for baricitinib. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
As reported in detail in the PK section of this report, concomitant administration of probenecid doubled the 
plasma exposure to baricitinib. Other OAT3 inhibitors, such as ibuprofen and diclofenac, have less inhibition 
potential than probenecid. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The 4 mg dose leads to an increased incidence of SAE, and temporary interruption of treatment as compared 
to the 2 mg dose in head-to-head comparison trial JADX and JADW.  
When  compared  to  active  comparators,  baricitinib  monotherapy  was  overall  similarly  tolerated  as  MTX 
monotherapy in DMARD-naïve patients, with the exception of a higher incidence of infections (43.3 vs. 38.1) 
and herpes zoster (2.5 vs 1.0%), not in favour of baricitinib. However, the combination of baricitinib + MTX 
was  poorly  tolerated  in  DMARD-naïve  patients,  with  high  rates  of  SAE  (16.3%),  treatment  discontinuations 
(10.7%) or interruptions (20%) due to AEs, which was about twice as a high as compared to the subsequent 
monotherapies (see table 51 below)  
Baricitinib  4  mg  was  also  less  tolerated  than  adalimumab  in  the  second  line  setting  (Study  JADV),  where 
Background  treatment  with  MTX  was  maintained  in  this  study.  The  drop-out  rate  was  7.4  vs.  3.9%  for 
baricitinib  and  adalimumab,  respective,  after  52  weeks.  The  rates  of  serious  infections  and  herpes  zoster, 
however, were more align in this treatment setting.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Baricitinib has a complex safety profile. Therefore, it is recommended in the SmPC that baricitinib should only 
be used under supervision of an experienced specialist.  
The following Adverse Drugs Reactions have been included in the SmPC: infections (URTI, h. simplex and h. 
zoster, gastroenteritis and urinary tract infections), neutropenia and thrombocytosis, increment of CPK, LDL-
cholesterol and triglycerides, liver function tests (AST, ALT), nausea and acne.  
As  expected  for  an  immune-modulating  drug,  baricitinib  causes  infections.  These  were  mainly  upper-
respiratory  tract  infections.  The  rate  of  infections  was  higher  for  baricitinib  than  for  placebo.  Serious 
infections  rates  according  to  ICH  criteria  were  overall  low.  The  rate  of  infections  moderately  increased  with 
the baricitinib dose.  
In  contrast  to  JAK1,3  inhibitor  tofacitinib,  JAK1,2  inhibitor  baricitinib  did  not  reduce  lymphocyte  counts. 
Whether  this  would  lead  to  a  different  risk  regarding  infections  of  baricitinib versus  tofacitinib  has  not been 
established.  
Although  there  was  no  treatment  related  effect,  as  precautionary  measures,  routine  monitoring  of 
neutropenia  and  lymphopenia  is  included  in  the  SmPC  (see  section  4.4).  This  is  supported,  as  these  are 
known  to  be  related  to  infections,  and  baricitinib  reduced  neutrophil  leukocytes  by  on  average  10%  from 
baseline. Even though baricitinib on itself did not reduce lymphocytes, lymphopenia is commonly reported for 
RA patients -possibly related to concurrent corticosteroid use-, and baricitinib may further increase the risk of 
infection in this group of patients.

Due to its mode of action, baricitinib causes viral reactivation. Herpes zoster and herpes simplex were more 
frequently reported for baricitinib than for placebo and MTX monotherapy. According to the literature, post-
herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a frequent complication, especially in elderly where RA is common. In European 
elderly, the risk of developing PHN was estimated as 12-15% (Family Practice (2002) 19 (5): 471-5, J Infect. 
2015; 70(2):178-86). PHN was not routinely monitored in the studies. As Investigators may have used global 
terms of h.zoster in their reports, the occurrence of PHN remains uncertain. 
Due  to  the  risks  of  complicated  h.  zoster  infection,  several  risk  minimization  measures  have  been  put  in 
place,  such  as  lowering  the  dose  to  2  mg  for  patients  at  risk  (e.g.  in  elderly,  patients  with  a  history  of 
recurrent  infections),  the  instructions  in  the  SmPC  (section  4.4)  to  interrupt  treatment  at  first  sign  of  h. 
zoster  and  a  patient’  alert  card  to  help  patients  identify  the  signs  of  infection  by  h.  zoster.  Outcomes  in  a 
subgroup  of  patients,  who  were  vaccinated  prior  to  treatment,  were  supportive  of  zoster  vaccination.  A 
recommendation for vaccination –in accordance to EULAR guideline on live vaccines- has been included in the 
SmPC (see SmPC section 4.4).   
Thus far, there was no signal of opportunistic infections above the background risk. Because of the mode of 
action  of  baricitinib,  opportunistic  infections  are  certainly  not  excluded,  and  it  is  therefore  supported  that 
these are included in the RMP as potential risk. Since 1 case of PML has been reported with Jakavi, another 
JAK1,2 inhibitor, this is addressed in the RMP for baricitinib as well. 
The  point  estimates  of  malignancies  in  the  pooled  analyses  were  within  the  range  as  reported  for  other  RA 
populations. However, the confidence intervals were wide, indicating uncertainty of the estimates, particularly 
at longer term follow-up.  
Mama  and  digestive  tract  carcinoma  were  most  frequently  reported,  as  may  be  expected  considering  the 
target population of middle-aged women and elderly.  
For lymphoma, an increasing trend is not excluded considering that two new cases emerged in a relative 
short time-frame, though the number are too low to draw firm conclusions at present stage. Malignancy will 
be further followed in a PASS. 
A general warning of enhanced risk of malignancies including lymphoma in the general RA patient population 
has been added to the SmPC (see section 4.4).  
Baricitinib is known to interfere with haematopoiesis above the therapeutic dose. Overall, the rate of anaemia 
was  marginally  increased  at  the  proposed  dose  level  of  4  mg.  A  warning  has  been  included  in  the  SmPC 
(section  4.4)  to  monitor  Hb  routinely,  also  considering  that  anaemia  is  common  in  the  general  target 
population of RA patients.  
Baricitinib had a clear and consistent inducing effect on cholesterol –both LDL and HDL. Moreover, weight and 
waist circumference also increased. Thus far, these changes are not been associated with a higher incidence 
of CV events for baricitinib, what normally would be expected if cholesterol increases. 
There  was  no  obvious  relationship  between  the  levels  of  LDL-C  and  the  occurrence  of  MACE  in  the  studies 
(MACE was overall uncommon). In contrast, there appeared to be more MACE in patients who had a decrease 
in LDL-C with baricitinib treatment in pooled analyses in RA studies.  
A NMR study indicated that the mechanism by baricitinib induced hypercholesterolaemia mainly consisted of 
large LDL- and HDL-C particles, which have more favourable atherogenic properties than small particles. 
Furthermore, baricitinib related LDL-C increments were responsive to statin treatment.  
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 109/132 
  
  
  
According  to  the  literature,  the  DMARD-induced  increments  of  cholesterol  appear  not  to  be  harmful  for  RA 
patients,  in  contrast  to  what  is  expected  of  cholesterol  increments  for  the  general  population.  Systematic 
reviews showed an 50% reduction of the risk of CV events for TNF-I (Arthritis Care Res 2011;63:522-9).  
It is known that RA patients with high active disease activity have reduced lipid levels. Despite relatively low 
lipids levels in patients with high active disease state, uncontrolled RA is associated with an increased risk of 
CV events, probably because of inflammation of the vascular system. It is thought that the related benefits of 
suppression  of  inflammation  seems  to  outweigh  the  risk  of  lipid  changes.  This  is  called  the  lipid  paradox  in 
the literature (for overview, see Ann Rheum Dis 2014; 73: 1281-1283, Rheumatology 2014; 53: 2143-54).  
Whether  this  is  also  the  case  for  baricitinib,  which  had  an  unprecedented  high  effect  on  lipids  ,  2-3  times 
exceeding  alternative  treatments,  needs  to  be  further  confirmed  post-marketing  in  the  general  target 
population,  which  may  be  at  higher  risk  than  the  selected  trial  population.  Lipid  increments  will  be  further 
followed in a PASS. 
MACE and CV were included in the RMP. There might be a point where the benefits of disease activity control 
do  not  outweigh  the  risks  of  increased  LDL-C  levels  at  long-term.  Limited  data  from  healthy  volunteers 
without  inflammation  did  not  fully  exclude  that  baricitinib  on  itself  might  induce  cholesterol.  Routine 
monitoring of lipids is recommended in the SmPC (section 4.4). 
ALT  and  AST  elevations  were  very  common,  although  severe  ALT  or  AST  elevations  were  overall  rare  and 
reported to similar extent as the active comparators. There was no obvious tendency of bilirubine increment 
–which would indicate more severe liver toxicity. Routine monitoring of Liver Function Tests is recommended 
in the SmPC (section 4.4).  
In  treatment  naïve  patients,  starting  with  a  combination  of  baricitinib  +  MTX  was  poorly  tolerated  as 
compared  to  monotherapies,  with  high  rates  of  drop-out  and  interruptions  because  of  hepatic  events  and 
infections.  
There  was  one  positive  de-challenge  case  of  jaundice  –with  moderately  increased  total  bilirubin-,  which 
occurred  two  days  after  the  introduction  of  baricitinib.  Although  this  case  formally  did  not  meet  Hy’s  law 
criteria of DILI, causality is not excluded. DILI has been adequately addressed in the RMP. 
Baricitinib  4  mg  caused  a  steady  increment  of  serum  creatinine  levels  of  about  5  µg/ml  in  the  total  study 
population (i.e non-renal patients).  
The  Applicant  postulated  that  the  increased  creatinine  was  due  to  an  interaction  effect  of  baricitinib  on 
tubular transporters of creatinine, by inhibition of the OCT-2, MATE-1, and MATE-2K transporters. 
Consecutively,  GFR  estimates  based  on  creatinine  levels  decreased  with  on  average  8.0  mL/min/BSA  from 
baseline, which remained stable for 104 weeks.  
In a study in diabetic nephropathy where other markers than creatinine were used to estimate GFR (such as 
cystatin C), no impact of baricitinib on renal function was observed. Possibly, this effect is an interaction at 
the  tubular  level  of  creatinine  excretion,  and  this  is  no  signal  of  loss  of  renal  capacity.  This  has  been 
adequately addressed in the SmPC section 5.1.  
Overall, there are no signals of nephrotoxicity.  
Also  CPK  increments  were  commonly  reported.  However,  these  were  not  clearly  accompanied  with  clinical 
symptoms  of  muscle  damage,  and  therefore  do  not  contribute  negatively  to  the  overall  B/R  balance. 
Myopathy has been included in the RMP as potential risk.  
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 110/132 
  
  
  
The  risk  of  infections  was  increased  in  elderly  which  could  be  expected  due  to  higher  comorbidity  in  these 
patients.  Particularly  in  elderly  patients  >  65  years  who  were  heavily  pre-treated  including  bDMARDs,  the 
incidence of h. zoster was 5-times higher for the 4 mg dose as compared to the low 2 mg dose. However, a 
reduction to 2 mg dose in elderly >65 years would lead to a relevant loss of efficacy, as shown in subgroup 
analyses.  
The dose recommendation of the low 2 mg dose for very elderly >75 years is supported (see SmPC section 
4.2), since there is limited experience in this vulnerable group, and infection risks may be even worse.  
For  moderate  renal  impaired  patients,  the  dose  is  restricted  to  2  mg  (SmPC  section  4.2),  to  prevent 
accumulation of the drug, which is renally cleared. Modelling and simulation data, together with clinical data, 
justified this dose recommendation. Renal patients may have low expression of erythropoietin, which is also 
targeted by baricitinib. There was a limited increased incidence of anaemia in renal patients when treated by 
baricitinib. The SmPC recommends routine monitoring for all patients, independent of renal function, which is 
considered adequate.  
A higher rate of amenorrhoea was reported for baricitinib (9 cases), add-on to MTX, as compared to placebo 
(one). However, in most cases, there were confounding factors, such as age above 50 years, concurrent oral 
contraceptive  use,  hypothyroidism  and  –possibly-  major  depression.  One  patient  in  whom  there  are  no 
obvious confounding factors was diagnosed with bone TB approximately 2 months after the amenorrhoea was 
reported. In conclusion, the majority of amenorrhoea cases were confounded, and as such no warnings were 
included in the SmPC.  
During  the  baricitinib  clinical  program,  15  women  had  become  pregnant  during  study  participation;  12  of 
these women were exposed to baricitinib. Pregnancy outcomes are available for 9 of the 12 baricitinib-treated 
patients: 2 resulted in a birth without evidence of fatal adverse effect, 2 resulted in premature births without 
evidence  of  fatal  adverse  effect,  4  resulted  in  spontaneous  abortions,  and  1  was  an  elective  termination. 
According  to  the  Applicant,  spontaneous  abortion  data  in  the  clinical  programme  are  similar  to  background 
rates observed; 17% of pregnancies in the US general population, 33% of pregnancies in RA patients treated 
with anti-TNF treatments and MTX or leflunomide, and 24% of RA patients treated with anti-TNF treatments 
without MTX end in foetal loss (Verstappen et al. 2011; Ventura et al. 2012).  
As the data are very limited, no firm conclusion could be drawn regarding the use of baricitinib during 
pregnancy. Based on pre-clinical studies in two models, the risk of bone malformation in the foetus is not 
excluded. Because of this uncertainty, a contra-indication has been formulated for pregnancy (SmPC section 
4.3). For discussion regarding fertility, pregnancy and lactation, see also preclinical part of this report. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Infections  including  herpes  zoster,  increased  lipids,  and  LFT  increments  are  associated  risks  of  baricitinib. 
Case  reports  of  lymphoma  emerging  after  long-term  exposure  are  a  matter  of  concern,  even  though  the 
overall  incidence  was  comparable  to  general  target  population  of  RA  patients.  Overall,  the  risks  were 
sufficiently addressed with monitoring advices in the SmPC and RMP, and by a dose reduction for patients at 
risk of infections. Also a recommendation to consider zoster vaccination has been included in the SmPC.  
Uncertainties are noted regarding long-term safety regarding CV risks due to hyperlipidaemia and 
malignancies. This could only reasonably be addressed in a large population in a post-marketing setting. A 
PASS in a US insurance database and the US registry Corrona is proposed by the Applicant, and a DUS to 
evaluate the adherence to risk minimisation measures. Also European registries will be involved, which is

supported, as there may be differences in the background risks of malignancy, opportunistic infections and 
CV events (e.g. smoking, diet), treatment modalities and access to healthcare/biologics  between the two 
continents (see RMP section below).

there were no confirmed cases of rhabdomyolysis. 
Further characterisation of the ADR is also provided in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC 
Increases in aminotransferases are included in table and text in Section 
4.8 of the SmPC as adverse drug reactions. 
The proposed text in the SmPC (4.4, the Special Warnings and Special 
Precautions for Use section) will: 
• 
inform that baricitinib treatment is associated with increases in 
aminotransferases and that increases to ≥5 and ≥10 x ULN were 
uncommonly observed for both ALT and AST, in patients treated with 
baricitinib in clinical trials. 
advise that if increases in ALT or AST are observed, and drug-induced 
liver injury is suspected, baricitinib should be interrupted until this 
diagnosis is excluded. 
• 
SmPC Section 4.2 will advise that the use of baricitinib in patients with 
severe hepatic impairment is not recommended. 
Increases in LDL and triglycerides are included in the SmPC as adverse 
drug reactions. 
The proposed text in the SmPC (4.4, the Special Warnings and Special 
Precautions for Use section) will inform that increases in lipid parameters, 
including total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides, were reported in 
patients treated with baricitinib, and advise that patients should be 
managed according to international clinical guidelines for hyperlipidaemia. 
Section 4.3 of the SmPC includes a contraindication for use  in pregnancy 
The proposed text in the SmPC (4.6 Fertility, Pregnancy and Lactation) 
will inform that there are limited data from the use of baricitinib in 
pregnant women, and that studies in animals have shown reproductive 
toxicity, so state that baricitinib should not be used during pregnancy. In 
addition, advice is provided that women of childbearing potential have to 
use effective contraception while taking baricitinib and for at least 1 week 
after final treatment.  
If a patient becomes pregnant while taking Olumiant the parents should 
be informed of the potential risk to the foetus Reference to the specific 
abnormalities observed in non-clinical species is also included in Section 
5.3 of the SmPC. 
None  
Section 4.4 of the SmPC states that the effect of lipid elevations on 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined and that 
the clinical data are insufficient to assess the potential incidence of 
malignancies following exposure to baricitinib. 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC states that the rate of serious infections, the 
pattern and incidence of elevation in ALT/AST, lipids, CPK and platelets as 
well as decreases in neutrophils, remained stable with long term 
treatment. 
Section 4.2 of the SmPC will advise that therapeutic experience in 
patients ≥75 years is very limited, and in these patients a starting dose of 
2-mg is appropriate. 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC will advise that screening for viral hepatitis 
should be performed before starting treatment and that if HBV DNA is 
detected, a liver specialist should be consulted to determine if treatment 
interruption is warranted. 
Section 4.2 of the SmPC will advise that Olumiant is not recommended for 
use in patients with severe hepatic impairment; Section 5.2 will provide 
further pharmacokinetic data on use in patients with hepatic impairment.

Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of baricitinib with active substances contained in authorised medicinal 
products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture of isomers, 
complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers baricitinib to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.

The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Quick Response (QR) code 
A request to include a QR code in the labelling and package leaflet, for the purpose of providing online access 
to information extracted from the package leaflet and additional information on the disease for which the 
medicinal product is indicated, has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable. 
The following elements have been agreed to be provided through a QR code:  
-the package leaflet 
-additional information on the disease (found acceptable as compliant with Article 62 of Directive 2001/83). 
2.10.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Olumiant (baricitinib) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
RA is a common chronic auto-immune disorder with synovitis of the joints. If the inflammation is insufficiently 
treated, it may lead to permanent structural joint deformations and loss of function. The aim of the treatment 
of baricitinib (and other DMARDS) is to suppress inflammation and disease progression. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
RA  patients  are  treated  with  disease-modifying  anti-rheumatic  drugs  (DMARDs),  often  in  combination  of 
multiple DMARDS and/or steroids. As an early intervention with DMARDs has shown to preserve function, the 
classification criteria of RA were modified by the ACR-EULAR in 2010 to allow DMARDs in an earlier disease 
phase.  Treatment-to-target  is  recommended,  i.e.  that  disease  activity  is  continuously  monitored  and 
treatment is adjusted to obtain remission or at least LDA (low Disease Activity).  
First choice of treatment is, in general, methotrexate (MTX), often accompanied with other synthetic DMARDs 
or  corticosteroids  at  the  start  of  treatment  and  at  flares.  About  50%  of  the  patients  do  not  respond 
sufficiently  to  MTX,  and  require  additional  treatments  with  biologic  DMARDs  like  TNF-inhibitors  (TNF-I), 
tocilizumab (IL-6 inhibitor) and abatacept (inhibits T-cell activation). These biologic DMARDs, in combination 
with MTX, are also indicated for DMARD-naïve patients with severe RA, but in clinical practice bDMARDs are 
mainly  used  as  second  line  therapy.    Rituximab,  a  B-cell  antagonist,  is  registered  as  a  treatment  option  in 
patients irresponsive to TNF-I.  
There is an unmet medical need for alternative treatment options with a new mode of action for patients 
irresponsive to multiple DMARDs including biologics. Furthermore, there is a need for alternative oral options 
when biological DMARDs are of limited availability or for patients unable to administer parenteral products.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Four  randomised  confirmatory  trials  were  performed  to  confirm  efficacy  and  safety  in  RA  (DMARD  naïve, 
patients with inadequate response to cDMARDs and bDMARDs).    
Two of the trials were active-controlled non-inferiority trials, where the active control was maintained for 52 
weeks.  In  the  second  line  setting,  baricitinib  4  mg  was  compared  to  TNF-I  adalimumab  (52  weeks)  and 
placebo (24 weeks) in MTX-IR patients (Study JADV, N = 1307). The patients maintained prior treatment of 
MTX in this study. This large-scaled, long-term active-controlled trial is considered a pivotal study.  
In the first line setting in DMARD-naïve patients, baricitinib 4 mg, with or without MTX, was compared to MTX 
alone (Study JADZ, N=584). Since the application for the first-line indication has been withdrawn, this study 
is considered as supportive evidence for efficacy (see discussion below). 
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 120/132 
  
  
  
The  other  trials  were  dose-finding  studies  with  baricitinib  2  and  4  mg,  and  placebo  in  second  line.  All 
treatments  were  add-on  to  MTX  or  other  cDMARDs  like  leflunomide.  One  dose-confirmation  trial  was 
performed in patients with an inadequate response to conventional synthetic DMARDS, but not treated with 
biologic DMARDs (Study JADX, N=684). The other dose confirmation trial was performed in more treatment-
experienced patients irresponsive to one or more biologic DMARDs (N= 527, Study JADW).  
All  subjects  from  the  Phase  III  trials  could  enter  open-label  extension  study  JADY.  In  this  study,  the 
possibility of dose tapering  was investigated in a subset of patients (N = 293), who achieved sustained Low 
Disease Activity after at least 15 months of treatment on a 4 mg dose. Subjects were randomised to either 
continuation of the 4 mg dose or a low 2 mg dose (double-blinded).  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Although non-inferiority was aimed, baricitinib 4 mg showed superior efficacy for primary endpoint ACR20, as 
compared to active-control adalimumab in MTX-IR patients (Study JADV). In the primary analyses, ACR20 at 
Week  12  was  69.6%  for  baricitinib  4  mg,  61.2%  for  adalimumab,  and  40.2%  for  placebo  (difference  vs. 
placebo 29.4% (95% CI 23.5, 35.4), vs. adalimumab (8.4 (1.7, 15.1)). Low Disease Activity (LDA) responder 
rates  of  baricitinib  4  mg  were  -marginally-  superior  to  adalimumab  at  Week  52  (see  effects  table  below). 
Non-inferiority  between  baricitinib  4  mg  and  adalimumab  was  shown  for  the  other  endpoints  regarding 
remission,  prevention  of  radiographic  progression  and  physical  function,  within  acceptability  ranges  of  -/+ 
12% for the responder rates (see effects table below ). 
Furthermore,  in  Study  JADZ  in  DMARD-naïve  patients,  baricitinib  4  mg  was  superior  to  MTX  monotherapy 
regarding ACR20 and remission outcomes, including the most critical one, the ACR-EULAR Boolean definition. 
The  prevention  of  structural  joint  damage  was  superior  for  the  baricitinib  +  MTX  combination  versus  MTX 
monotherapy -though not for baricitinib monotherapy. See effects table below.  
In  Study  JADX,  in  patients  with  an  inadequate  response  to  conventional  DMARDs  (second  line),  both  the 
baricitinib  2  and  4  mg  dose  were  superior  to  placebo  after  12  and  24  weeks,  without  relevant  differences 
between  2  and  4  mg  dose  for  the  primary  endpoint  ACR20.  The  prevention  of  structural  damage  by  X-ray, 
however,  was  more  robustly  shown  for  the  4  mg  dose  than  the  2  mg  dose  as  confirmed  by  conservative 
sensitivity analyses such as LOCF. About 30% of the subjects in this study received other synthetic DMARDs 
than MTX as background therapy. This had no relevant impact on efficacy outcomes.     
In more treatment-experienced patients irresponsive to biologic DMARDS in Study JADW, there was a more 
clear distinction between the 2 and 4 mg dose. The response of the primary endpoint ACR20 at Week 12 was 
55.4% for baricitinib 4 mg, 48.9% for baricitinib 2 mg and 27.3% for placebo (difference baricitinib 4 mg vs 
placebo: 28.1% (95% CI 18.2, 37.9), 2 mg vs placebo 21.6 (11.7, 31.5). More clinical meaningful treatment 
effects  were  shown  for  the  4  mg  dose  regarding  LDA  and  remission.  E.g.  the  percentage  of  subject  with 
DAS28-hsCRP≤ 3.2 at Week 24, was 33.3% for baricitinib 4 mg, 20.1% for baricitinib 2 mg, and 11.4% for 
placebo (baricitinib 4 mg vs PBO: difference 22.0% (95% CI 13.6, 30.3); baricitinib 2 mg vs PBO: 8.8% (1.2, 
16.3)). Similar results were observed for LDA by CDAI, an outcome which is unbiased for the specific effect of 
acute phase reactants by baricitinib (see effects table below) 
Maintenance of efficacy has been further established in the two long-term 52 weeks active controlled studies 
(JADZ and JADV) (see effects table below).   
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 121/132 
  
  
  
The  possibility  of  dose-tapering  was  further  evaluated  in  a  subset  of  patients  from  the  long-term  extension 
Study JADY. After 12 weeks, 93% of patients continuing with 4 mg versus 84% of the patients stepping down 
to 2 mg, maintained Low Disease Activity level (p = 0.03).  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In study JADZ in naïve patients, the active comparator consisted of MTX monotherapy. This may be 
considered suboptimal. The recent EULAR RA treatment guideline recommends a combination of low dose 
steroids or other synthetic DMARDs with MTX in naïve patients, to overcome the fact that MTX has to be 
slowly titrated and, therefore, has a slow onset of effect. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Haematology /immunology 
Baricitinib reduced the levels of neutrophil granulocytes and NK-cells. Severe neutropenia (< 1.0 billion cells 
/L), however, was rarely reported (0.2 and 0.6 % after the 2 and 4 mg dose, respectively, versus 0 placebo). 
The  risk  of  infections  was  higher  at  neutropenia.  About  20%  of  the  subjects  had  NK-levels  below  normal 
level. Monitoring guidance on absolute neutrophil count has been included in the SmPC (see section 4.4).  
Infections 
A statistically significant larger proportion of patients treated with baricitinib 4 mg had infections comparing 
to  placebo  (36.3%  vs.  27.9%,  respectively,  Odds  Ratio  1.4  (95%  CI  1.2-1.7),  p  <  0.001).  Most  infections 
were upper-respiratory tract infections or gastro-enteritis. The rates of serious infections were overall modest 
(1.5% vs 1.6%, for baricitinib 4 mg vs placebo, leading to permanent discontinuations: 1.5% vs. 0.7%). The 
rate  of  infections  increased  with  the  baricitinib  dose  (e.g.  30.6%  vs.  42.5%  for  the  2  and  4  mg  dose, 
respectively Study JADX). A warning regarding initiation of baricitinib therapy has been included in the SmPC 
(see section 4.4). 
Baricitinib induced viral reactivation. In the pooled analyses at Week 24, the incidence of herpes zoster was 
1.8% versus 0.4% placebo (Odds ratio 4.59 (95% CI 1.5, 13.6), and maintained stable at longer-term follow 
up. The incidence was also higher as compared to active comparator MTX and –to lesser extent- adalimumab 
(see effects table below). The majority of the cases were uncomplicated: 5 out of the 138 cases involved of 
multiple dermatomes and/or facial nerve palsy).  The highest incidence and background risk of h. zoster was 
observed  in  heavily  re-treated  patients  irresponsive  to  biologic  DMARDS  (see  effects  table).  It  is 
recommended  in  the  SmPC  (section  4.4)  that in  case  a  patient  develops  herpes  zoster,  Olumiant  should  be 
temporarily interrupted.  
There was no obvious signal of opportunistic infections.  
Malignancies  
The mean incidence rate of malignancies excluding NMSC (non-melanoma skin cancer) in the pooled dataset 
was 0.73 per 100 py (95% CI 0.5, 1.0), which was within the range of historical data from trials with other 
DMARDs (0.56-1,43 per 100 py). The point estimate of the IR of all malignancies excluding NMSC was higher 
for  the  4  mg  dose  (1.1/100  PY),  than  for  the  2  mg  dose  arm  (0.4/100  PY),  although  the  95%  CI  of  the 
incidences  overlapped    (0.4,  2.4  for  4  mg  dose,  and  0.1,  1.6  for  the  2  mg  dose).  Most  commonly  reported 
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 122/132 
  
  
  
 
solid  malignancies  were  mamma  carcinoma  (6  of  the  in  total  36  cases),  lung  cancer  (5  cases)  ,  GI  tract 
cancer (5 cases) and melanoma (2 cases). The mean incidence of NMSC was 0.4/100 PY (95% CI 0.2, 0.6), 
which is compatible to other RA study populations.  
In  the  data  original  submitted,  with  a  cut-off  date  of  15  Augustus  2015,  three  cases  of  lymphoma  were 
reported.  In  the  follow-up  period  of  4  months  till  1  January  2016,  two  new  cases  were  reported.    The  IR 
increased  from  0.06  to  0.095  per  100  PY  (95%  CI,  0.031,  0.223).  The  latter  IR  is  still  within  the  range  as 
reported for the general RA patients’ population, which is a population at risk of lymphoma. Of the in total 5 
cases,  Epstein  Barr  virus  involvement  was  confirmed  for  one  B-cell  lymphoma,  one  was  related  to  H.pylori 
(MALT), and the one case of T-cell lymphoma was confirmed EBV negative, and two cases were not evaluated 
on EBV involvement.   
Lipids 
It is known that RA patients with high active disease activity have reduced lipid levels. Despite relatively low 
lipids levels in patients with high active disease state, uncontrolled RA is associated with an increased risk of 
CV events, probably because of inflammation of the vascular system. It is thought that the related benefits of 
suppression of inflammation seems to outweigh the risk of lipid changes.  
Whether  this  is  also  the  case  for  baricitinib,  which  had  an  unprecedented  high  effect  on  lipids  ,  2-3  times 
exceeding  alternative  treatments,  needs  to  be  further  confirmed  post-marketing  in  the  general  target 
population,  which  may  be  at  higher  risk  than  the  selected  trial  population.  Lipid  increments  will  be  further 
followed in a PASS. 
Hepatotoxicity 
ALT and AST increments from baseline < 3 x ULN were commonly reported (about 20%). Significant ALT or 
AST  increments  (>5  x  ULN)  were  in  general  rare  and  transient.  If  increases  in  ALT  or  AST  are  observed 
during  routine  patient  management  and  drug-induced  liver  injury  is  suspected,  Olumiant  should  be 
temporarily interrupted until this diagnosis is excluded. 
Gastrointestinal  
In  naïve patients, nausea  and vomiting were reported at similar rates for baricitinib and MTX monotherapy, 
though the combination was less well tolerated (see effects table)  
GI  perforations  are  an  established  risk  of  other  DMARDS  targeting  IL6  pathway.  The  incidence  of  GI 
perforation for baricitinib is low (two cases, 0.05 per 100 PY).  
Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) 
Baricitinib induces an increment of CPK levels. The incidence rates of significant increments (> 5 x ULN) were 
1.3% for the 4 mg dose, 0.8% for the 2 mg dose, and 0.3% for placebo. There was no clinical sequela.  
Pregnancy 
Because of the pre-clinical findings of skeletal deformations in foetus, a contra-indication in pregnancy has 
been included in the SmPC. The need for a pregnancy prevention plan was evaluated, since several 
pregnancies (15) occurred in the trial setting, despite restrictive measures in the protocol. To address this 
issue, educational material, including a patient alert card, will be made available in order to emphasiz the 
contra-indication and addressing that child-wish should be discussed with patients. In addition to the contra-
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 123/132 
  
  
  
 
indication, additional wording has been added to section 4.6 of the SmPC that women of childbearing 
potential have to use effective contraception during and after treatment. If a patient becomes pregnant while 
taking Olumiant the parents should be informed of the potential risk to the foetus. At present stage, these 
measures are considered adequate by CHMP, and no PPP is requested. No signal of teratogenicity in humans 
was observed thus far, though the numbers are too small to exclude such a risk at present stage. 
Furthermore, an European treatment guidance by the EULAR is available, addressing that rheumatologists 
should be aware of the risks of DMARDs at conception and during pregnancy.  
As the target population also includes younger women, the need for contraception will also be addressed in 
the alert card. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Malignancies 
The  incidence  rates  of  malignancies  and  NMSC  of  baricitinib  were  in  line  with  what  has  been  reported  for 
other  DMARDs  or  RA  populations.  Also  the  SIR  of  all  malignancies  or  lymphoma  was  within  the  range  of 
expectations.  Pre-clinical  studies  did  not  indicate  that  baricitinib  is  carcinogenic.  However,  the  confidence 
interval of the estimates are wide, and 2 cases of lymphoma emerged in a relatively short time frame of 4.5 
months of follow-up (920.3 PY). However further data regarding the risk of malignancies will be generated in 
post-marketing (see RMP section). 
Lipids 
The consequences of increased LDL-C levels by baricitinib are not fully clear, as these exceeded the effects of 
standard care with controls MTX and adalimumab on lipids. It may take multiple years before CV events due 
to  hypercholesterolaemia  develop.  Moreover,  the  general  target  population  may  be  at  higher  risk  of  CV 
disorders than the selected study populations. Lipid increments will be further followed in a PASS. 
PK interactions 
There  are  uncertainties  regarding  interaction  at  the  level  of  P-glycoprotein,  OAT2  and  OCT1  transporters, 
which will be addressed post-marketing.  
Pregnancy 
In  two  animal  models,  baricitinib  showed  skeletal  anomalies  in  developing  foetus,  with  relatively  low  safety 
margin (NOAEL < 2 times therapeutic level). No signal of teratogenicity was observed in the limited number 
of  exposed  pregnancies  (n=15)  in  the  trial  setting,  though  the  exposed  population  is  too  small  to  draw 
conclusions regarding the risks of baricitinib for the foetus.  
Elderly 
In patients aged ≥65 years, a 5 times higher incidence rate of h.zoster was observed in the 4-mg than in the 
2-mg dose group in the bDMARD-IR patients’ population (13.5% versus 2.4%). Limited data were available 
in very elderly 75 years (n=77). A recommendation for dose reduction in patients over 74 years has been 
included in the SmPC.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Important favourable effects 
Baricitinib  as  an  oral  treatment  was  efficacious  to  reduce  disease  activity  in  patients  with  moderate-severe 
active RA to a clinically relevant extent.  
In  all  4  trials  in  different  disease  stages,  varying  from  DMARD-naïve  RA  patients  to  treatment-experienced 
patients with an inadequate response to multiple biologic DMARDs, the primary endpoint ACR20 at Week 12-
24 was met. Also maintenance of efficacy has been demonstrated in 12 months trials, which is important in a 
chronic disorder like RA.   
ACR20  represents  a  relative  small  improvement  of  20%  of  signs  and  symptoms  from  baseline.  From 
epidemiological  databases  and  long-term  follow-up  studies  it  is  known,  that  sustained  reduction  of  disease 
activity  below  an  established  target  -remission  or  Low  Disease  Activity  according  to  DAS28-  prevents 
structural joint damage and deterioration of physical function. Baricitinib showed superior efficacy regarding 
DAS28-CRP  remission/LDA  compared  to  placebo  and  active  control  adalimumab  and  MTX.  Recently,  it  was 
noted  in  the  literature  that  for  drugs  with  a  specific  effect  on  acute  phase  reactant,  like  baricitinib,  DAS28-
CRP  may  overestimate  remission  response.  LDA  and  remission  targets  as  defined  by  SDAI/CDAI,  endpoints 
which are less biased by the effect on acute phase reactant, were also superior for baricitinib, as compared to 
placebo and active controls.   
Furthermore,  clinical  relevance  of  ACR20  is  supported  by  other  endpoints,  such  as  prevention  of  structural 
damage  by  X-ray,  improvement  of  physical  function  (HAQ-DI),  fatigue,  morning  stiffness  and  several  QOL 
scales.  
There  is  a  need  for  new  treatment  options  of  patients  with  an  inadequate  response  to  multiple  classes  of 
DMARDs.  Baricitinib  fulfils  this  need,  as  shown  in  subgroup  analyses  in  this  special  patients’  group  where 
baricitinib was superior to placebo in achieving LDA.   
Currently,  limited  alternative  oral  treatment  options  are  available  for  patients  irresponsive  to  MTX,  the  first 
choice  of  treatment,  and  biologic  DMARDS  will  be  used  often  in  these  patients.  Biologics  have  the  risk  of 
drug-antibody formation, and subsequent loss of efficacy and infusion reactions, which are not apparent for 
baricitinib.  Patients  may  prefer  oral  drugs  over  parental  administrations.  Another  favourable  aspect  of 
baricitinib as compared to biologicals is its considerable shorter PK and PD half-life. Treatment interruption in 
case of an adverse drug reaction is more abrupt than for biologicals. In addition, baricitinib would be the only 
oral treatment option that will be registered for patients irresponsive to a bDMARD thus far. 
EMA/13493/2017

In  general,  the  studies  were  adequately  designed.  However,  in  Study  JADZ  in  naïve  patients,  MTX 
monotherapy was chosen as comparator which is not considered optimal to modern standards. As MTX has to 
be titrated for reason of tolerability, the onset of effect is relatively slow. A combination of corticosteroids and 
other synthetic DMARDs, as recommended in the EULAR treatment guideline in accordance to the treatment-
to-target  principle,  would  have  been  a  more  optimal  comparator.  However,  since  this  was  not  discussed  at 
the  scientific  advices  when  designing  the  studies  and  as  the  CHMP  approved  the  study  design,  this  issue 
forms  no  major  objection.  Although  the  treatment  effect  of  baricitinib  may  have  been  somewhat  inflated  in 
this study in naïve patients, the response to baricitinib is still considered robust and clinically meaningful on 
its own. 
Importance unfavourable effects 
The drop-out rates of baricitinib due to any adverse event were overall modest, though higher than the active 
controls MTX and adalimumab. Common Adverse Drug Reactions were infections, liver enzyme abnormalities, 
and  hyperlipidaemia.  Important  Adverse  Drug  Reactions  that  were  more  frequently  reported  for  baricitinib 
than the active controls were infections by herpes zoster and hyperlipidaemia.    
Viral  reactivation  and  H.zoster  is  a  particular  risk  due  to  the  mode  of  action  of  JAK  inhibitors,  baricitinib 
included.  It  was  argued  that  most  cases  (95%)  were  uncomplicated  and  the  minority  of  these  cases  were 
reported  as  SAE  (14%).  However,  herpes  zoster  may  induce  post-herpetic  neuralgia,  which  could  be  long-
lasting  and  bothersome  for  patients.  Baricitinib  caused  persistent  increments  of  lipids  including  LDL-
cholesterol.  Lipid  increments  were  also  observed  for  the  active  controls  MTX  and  adalimumab,  however,  to 
considerable  lesser  extent  than  for  baricitinib.  There  was  no  increased  incidence  of  MACE  for  baricitinib  as 
compared to  placebo  or  active  controls.  The  trial  population  constituted  a  selected  population  at low  risk  of 
cardiovascular  events,  as  compared to  the general  target  population  of  RA  patients,  where  the  incidence  of 
CV events is reported to be as twice as high as the normal reference population.   
Thus  far,  the  incidence  rates  of  malignancies  and  NMSC  of  baricitinib  were  in  line  with  what  has  been 
reported for other DMARDs or RA populations. Also the SIR of all malignancies or lymphoma was within the 
range of expectations.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Baricitinib  showed  a  relevant  and  persistent  clinical  response,  in  a  study  population  representative  for  the 
target population. At the standard dose of 4 mg, baricitinib was superior to adalimumab regarding LDA and 
fatigue. Baricitinib in combination with MTX also prevented structural joint damage.   
For  the  second-line  target  population  of  RA  patients  not  responding  to  synthetic  DMARDs,  very  limited oral 
alternative  treatments  are  available.  Biologic  DMARDs  have  risks  such  as  antibody  formation  and  infusion 
reaction,  which  is  not  present  for  oral  synthetic  drugs  like  baricitinib.  Some  patients  may  prefer  oral 
treatment  over  injections.  Baricitinib  fulfils  the  need  for  patients  with  an  inadequate  response  to  multiple 
biologic DMARDs. 
The incidence of herpes zoster of baricitinib was increased compared to adalimumab in the trial, and 
historical data of TNF-inhibitors and tocilizumab. However, alternative treatment options like TNF-I have 
shown an increased risk of disseminated tuberculosis, and rituximab has been associated with PML, which is 
not the case for baricitinib. Several risk minimisation measures have been put in place, such as a dose 
reduction to 2 mg in patients at risk (i.e. patients with history of recurrent infections and elderly > 75 y) and 
interruption of treatment in the case reactivated herpes zoster. In the trials, treatment was immediately 
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 128/132 
  
  
  
withdrawn once symptoms of h.zoster infection occurred, and this may have contributed that complications 
such as facial palsy and systemic features were limited. A patient alert card will be available, which may help 
to early diagnose the patients in real-life clinical setting. Taking these measures into consideration, the 
benefits of baricitinib outweigh the risk of h.zoster. 
Hypercholesterolaemia was higher for baricitinib than for the active control adalimumab. To date, this did not 
lead  to  increased  incidence  of  MACE.  In  the  SmPC,  a  recommendation  for  continuous  monitoring  was 
included, which is considered sufficiently adequate to address the risk at present stage. As the effect on lipids 
was  dose  dependent,  the advice  of  tapering  from  the  4  mg dose  to  the  2  mg dose in  stable  patients  might 
further mitigate this risk.  
Uncertainties regarding the risk of lymphoma will be addressed in a PASS comprising US/EU registries, which 
is considered adequate . Furthermore, a warning has been included in SmPC about the potential risk and 
required vigilance of lymphoma for the attention of the prescriber which is considered adequate for marketing 
authorisation. 
Naïve patients 
Baricitinib  also  showed  an  earlier  and  superior  response  to  MTX  regarding  ACR-EULAR  remission  in  naïve 
patients.  However,  the  benefit-risk  balance  should  be  envisioned  in  the  context  of  available  alternative 
treatment  options  in  each  treatment  setting,  and  this  is  different  for  naïve  patients  versus  patients 
irresponsive  to  one  or  multiple  DMARDs.  Several  well-established  oral  treatments  are  available  for  naïve 
patients.  The  response  to  MTX  monotherapy  was  still  considerable,  and  would  have  been  better  if  this  was 
combined with low-dose steroids, as now recommended in European treatment guidelines. In clinical practice, 
MTX may be poorly tolerated. However, baricitinib monotherapy showed no benefits towards MTX regarding 
drop-out  due  to  intolerance.  Superiority  regarding  the  prevention  of  structural  damage  was  only 
demonstrated  when  baricitinib  was  combined  with  MTX.  However,  tolerance  towards  the  combination  was 
worse in naïve patients, as compared to patients who received baricitinib add-on to prior treatment of MTX.   
Starting baricitinib in newly diagnosed patients will lead to prolonged exposure to this new drug.  At present 
stage, there are too many uncertainties regarding the long-term safety of baricitinib in terms of 
malignancies, and cardiovascular complications due to hyperlipidaemia, to allow a first-line indication. It is 
anticipated that more safety data will become available for baricitinib from the second line treatment setting, 
where the B/R balance of baricitinib is considered positive. A PASS and a registry, both in the US and Europe, 
have been included in the RMP.  
It  is  noted  that  several  biologic  DMARDs  have  been  registered  for  the  first-line  treatment,  despite  their 
drawbacks,  albeit  for  a  limited  indication  of  severe  RA  patients.  However,  the  first-line  indications  of 
bDMARDs  were  only  approved  after  broad  experience  was  obtained  in  the  real-life  clinical  setting,  following 
authorisation for a second line treatment.  Such a strategy is also being applied for baricitinib.  
For  baricitinib  4  mg  monotherapy,  discontinuation  rates  were  marginally  increased  as  compared  to  MTX 
monotherapy  in  naïve  patients  (6.9%  versus  5.2%).  Naïve  patients  poorly  tolerated  the  combination  MTX+ 
baricitinib  (drop-out  rate  10.7%  after  52  weeks,  of  which  7%  in  the  first  6  months),  mainly  because  of 
hepatotoxic events and infections. 
Combination with cDMARDs 
It  was  initially  proposed  that  Baricitinib  could  be  given  as  add-on  to  other  conventional  synthetic  DMARDs 
than  MTX.  However,  as  the  majority  of  the  study  population  used  MTX  as  background  therapy,  and 
considering  the  heterogeneity  of  the  other  synthetic  DMARDs  that  were  used  regarding  safety  and  efficacy, 
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 129/132 
  
  
  
the CHMP was of the opinion that there isn’t enough data to support the broad indication “monotherapy or in 
combination  with  conventional  synthetic  DMARDs”.  The  indication  was  restricted  to  MTX  use  (or 
monotherapy),  and  reference  is  made  to  other  sections  of  the  SmPC  regarding  information  on  the  use  in 
combination with hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide, and sulphasalazine (section 5.1). Warnings were included 
regarding  the  combination  wiith  potent  immunosuppressive  medicinal  products  such  as  azathioprine, 
tacrolimus, or ciclosporin, which is considered appropriate.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Additional risk minimisations 
Because of its mode of action, baricitinib may induce neutropenia and cause infections. Most infections were 
upper  respiratory  tract  infections,  gastro-enteritis  and  urinary  tract  infections.  Serious  infections  were  rare 
which occurred in similar rates as compared to placebo or active controls. In contrast to biologicals, the half-
life  of  baricitinib  is  short,  and  treatment  withdrawal  is  recommended  once  infections  occur.  This  was  also 
applied  in  the  trials,  and  overall,  the  incidence  of  serious  infections  was  low  and  manageable.  Routine 
monitoring of neutropenia is proposed, which may further mitigate the risk.  
Abnormal liver function tests were also frequently reported. The incidence rates of severe events were similar 
or even lower than active controls MTX monotherapy and adalimumab, and most cases were transient. It is, 
however, noted that the combination of MTX + baricitinib in naive patients, was poorly tolerated regarding 
hepatotoxic and gastric events versus monotherapies of either drug. This has been addressed in the SmPC. 
No cases of DILI were reported. Continuous monitoring is recommended in the SmPC, which is considered 
adequate.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Olumiant is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Olumiant is favourable in the following indication: 
Olumiant is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients 
who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic 
drugs. Olumiant may be used as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate (see sections 4.4, 4.5 
and 5.1 for available data on different combinations). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 130/132 
  
  
  
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product within 
6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the  agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to launch of Olumiant in each Member State, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) must agree 
about the content and format of the educational materials, including communication media, distribution 
modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent Authority.  
The main objectives of the programme are to make the prescribers aware of the risks associated with the 
product’s use, and to highlight specific risk minimisation measures to be performed before and during the 
treatment with Olumiant.  
The MAH shall ensure that, in each Member State where Olumiant is marketed, all healthcare professionals 
who are expected to prescribe Olumiant are provided with the physician educational material, which should 
contain:  
o  The Summary of Product Characteristics 
o  The Package Leaflet including the Patient Alert Card 
o  The guide for healthcare professionals to support counselling of the patient 
EMA/13493/2017 
Page 131/132 
  
  
  
o  Additional Patient Alert Cards 
The guide for healthcare professionals shall contain the following key elements: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
That Olumiant increases the potential risk of infections. Patients should be instructed to seek 
immediate medical attention, if signs or symptoms suggesting infection appear. 
That Olumiant use should be stopped in case of herpes zoster or any other infection that doesn’t 
respond to standard treatment until the event resolves. Patients should not be immunised using live 
attenuated vaccines shortly before or during treatment with Olumiant. 
Prescribers should screen the patients for viral hepatitis before commencing Olumiant treatment. 
Active tuberculosis should also be ruled out.  
That Olumiant use is associated with hyperlipidaemia; prescribers should monitor the patient’s lipid 
parameters and manage the hyperlipidaemia, if detected.  
That Olumiant is contraindicated in pregnancy as pre-clinical data showed reduced foetal growth and 
malformations. Physicians should advise women of child bearing potential to use contraception during 
treatment and for a week after its ending. If a planned pregnancy is considered, Olumiant treatment 
should be stopped. 
• 
The purpose and use of the Patient Alert Card 
The patient alert card shall contain the following key messages:  
• 
That treatment with Olumiant may increase the risk of infections, and viral reactivation. 
•  Signs or symptoms of infections including general symptoms, and specifically tubercolosis and herpes 
zoster signs and symptoms; and a warning for the patients to seek immediate medical attention if 
signs or symptoms suggesting infection appear 
• 
• 
That Olumiant should not be taken while pregnant and that women should inform their doctor should 
they become (or wish to become) pregnant 
That the patient may need to have their cholesterol level checked during treatment 
•  Contact details of the prescriber  
• 
That the Patient Alert Card should be carried by the patient at any time and to share it with other 
healthcare professionals involved in their treatment. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that baricitinib is considered to be a 
new active substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the 
European Union.

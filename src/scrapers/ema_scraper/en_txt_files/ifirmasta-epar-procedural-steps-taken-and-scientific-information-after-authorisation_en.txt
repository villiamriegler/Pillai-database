are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Please refer to the assessment report:  
Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC and requested the 
CHMP to assess the impact of nitrosamine impurities 
on the benefit-risk balance of valsartan-containing 
medicinal products and to issue a recommendation 
on whether the relevant marketing authorisations 
should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked.

During the CHMP plenary meeting in September 
2018, the scope of the referral has been widened to 
include all sartans with a tetrazole group in their 
molecular structure (candesartan, irbesartan, 
losartan, olmesartan and valsartan). The CHMP 
Opinion was issued on 31 January 2019 and the 
Commission Decision was issued on 15 April 2019. 
In a letter dated 29 July 2020, the European 
Commission requested the EMA to assess the impact 
of the outcome of the Article 5(3) assessment on 
nitrosamines adopted on 25 June 2020 on the 
CHMP's opinion of 31 January 2019 for the scientific 
assessment and review under Article 31 of Directive 
2001/83/EC regarding angiotensin-II-receptor 
antagonists (sartans) containing a tetrazole group 
(EMEA/H/A-31/1471). The CHMP was requested to 
give its recommendation whether the conditions of 
the Marketing Authorisations should be varied.

evidence from the scientific literature on dual RAS 
blockade therapy and given the seriousness of the 
identified safety concerns, the Italian Medicines 
Agency (AIFA) initiated a review under Article 31 of 
Council Directive 2001/83/EC, requesting the 
Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee 
(PRAC) to issue a recommendation on the benefit-
risk of dual RAS blockade therapy through the 
combined use of angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors), angiotensin II receptor 
blockers (ARBs) or aliskiren and to determine 
whether any regulatory measures should be taken on 
the marketing authorisations of the products 
involved in this procedure.

efficacy, including all variations introduced since the 
and PL 
granting of the initial marketing authorisation, the CHMP 
considered that the benefit-risk balance of Ifirmasta in the 
authorised indications remains favourable and therefore 
recommended the renewal of the marketing authorisation, 
subject to the conditions as laid down in Annex II to the 
Opinion.  
The CHMP considered that the Marketing Authorisation 
could be granted with unlimited validity.  
The CHMP recommended amendments to the Annexes I, II, 
IIIA and IIIB. These changes do not affect the benefit-risk 
balance of the product, which remains positive.

The MAH applied for an update of the SPC sections

SmPC and PL 
Available data regarding use of AIIRAs during lactation 
4.3 and 4.6 as well as PL section 2 to implement the 
CHMP recommendation on a harmonised labelling 
relating to the use of Angiotensin II Receptor 
Antagonists (AIIRAs) during pregnancy and lactation. 
Furthermore, minor typographical changes have 
been introduced to SPC section 4.4. In addition, the 
MAH took the opportunity to update PL sections 1-4 
in order to align the information with the approved 
wording of the reference product. Moreover, the list 
of local representatives in the PL has been amended. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
have been assessed. There are no concrete data to support 
the contraindication of use of AIIRAs during breast-feeding. 
All AIIRA agents were found in the milk of lactating rats but 
no human data about their transfer into breast milk are 
available. There is only a theoretical presumption of low 
transport according to their high plasma protein binding 
and low oral availability. A harmonised wording 
recommending an alternative treatment with better 
established safety profiles during breast-feeding, especially 
while nursing a newborn or preterm infant, has been 
included in section 4.6 of the SPC and Section 2 of the PL. 
Consequently, the existing contraindication for lactation has 
Page 9/10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
been deleted.

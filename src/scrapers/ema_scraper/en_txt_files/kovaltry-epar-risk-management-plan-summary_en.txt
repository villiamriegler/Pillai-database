Summary of Risk Management Plan for Kovaltry®
1.
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Kovaltry®. The RMP details 
important risks of Kovaltry®, how these risks can be minimised, how more information will 
be obtained about risks and uncertainties (missing information), and how gaps in knowledge 
about the safety of Kovaltry® in certain groups of patients (missing information) will be filled.
The summary of product characteristics (SPC) for Kovaltry®and the package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Kovaltry® should be 
used.
This summary of the RMP for Kovaltry® should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of the
RMP for Kovaltry®.
The Medicine and What it is Used For
2.
Kovaltry® is authorised for treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with 
haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency). Kovaltry® can be used for all age groups
(see SPC for the full indication). It contains recombinant human coagulation FVIII (octocog 
alfa) as the active substance and it is given by injection.
Further information about the evaluation of the benefits of Kovaltry®can be found in the
EPAR, including a plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines Agency
(EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage:
https://www.ema.europa.eu/medicines/human/EPAR/kovaltry

Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or 
Further Characterise the Risks
Important risks of Kovaltry®, together with measures to minimise these risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Kovaltry® risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;

 The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly;
 The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.

Part VI – Summary of Activities in the Risk Management Plan by Product
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including periodic benefit-risk evaluation report (PBRER) assessment,
so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.
If important information that may affect the safe use of Kovaltry® is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below.
List of Important Risks and Missing Information
3.1
Important risks of Kovaltry® are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Kovaltry®. Potential risks are concerns 
for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but 
this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product in certain groups of 
patients is not yet available that is currently missing.

Study 13400 (Part A and Part B)
The reasons why about one third of previously untreated patients 
(PUPs) develop inhibitors and the other two thirds are seemingly 
tolerant to the foreign FVIII protein still continues to be investigated (1, 
11). What is known so far is that inhibitor development is a result of an 
intricate interplay of both genetic and environmental factors, with the 
causal F8 gene mutation and other polymorphisms in immune response 
genes playing a major role in this field (12-14).
Numerous trials have analysed the correlation of factors with the risk of 
inhibitors. The most compelling patient-related factors are haemophilia 
severity, F8 gene mutations, and other genetic factors such as family 
history of inhibitors, and race or ethnicity.
The risk of developing an inhibitor is highest in the first 20 exposure 
days (EDs) to FVIII products, with > 95% inhibitors detected by the 50th 
ED. Inhibitor development is lowest in patients who have received FVIII 
products for more than 150 EDs (15). In the completed main phase of 
the clinical trial in PUPs/ minimally treated patients (MTPs), FVIII 
inhibitors were observed in 54.8% of patients. The inhibitor incidence 
might have been influenced by consecutive high titre inhibitor cases 
observed in the middle of the study. While the most recent cumulative 
data from the registries show that the inhibitor rate for Kovaltry® is in line 
with the expected range in PUPs, the data are limited due to low sample 
size.

Studies of patients with haemophilia (PWH) found that patients with 
concomitant heart disease were likely to be older and more likely to 
have hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and diabetes than those without 
heart disease.
Hypertension was found to be more common in PWH patients than in 
the general population.
Additional factors associated with haemophilia, may increase the risk of 
cardiovascular disease.

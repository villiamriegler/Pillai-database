2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
2.1.1.1.  Epidemiology 
Hepatitis C virus infection is a global health challenge with an estimated global prevalence of 1%, for a total 
of 71 million individuals worldwide chronically infected with HCV (The Polaris Observatory HCV Collaborators 
2017), (World Health Organization (WHO) 2018b). In the US, over 3 million people are estimated to be 
chronically infected with HCV (Center for Disease Control and Prevention 2016), and in Europe an estimated 
Assessment report

10 to 14 million people have chronic HCV infection (The Polaris Observatory HCV Collaborators 2017), (World 
Health Organization (WHO) 2018c). Up to 85% of individuals infected with HCV fail to clear the virus and 
progress to chronic infection; over the ensuing 20 years, as many as 20% of patients with chronic HCV 
infection are estimated to develop complications, including cirrhosis, end stage liver disease, and 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Curing HCV infection is associated with numerous health benefits, including 
more than 70% reduction in the risk of HCC and 90% reduction in the risk of liver-related mortality and liver 
transplantation (Morgan 2013), (van der Meer 2012), (Veldt 2007), (Poynard 2002). 
The estimated prevalence of HCV infection in children is up to 0.4% in Europe and the US and up to 6% in 
resource-limited countries (El-Shabrawi 2013), (Khaderi 2014). Globally, it is estimated that approximately 
2.1 to 3.5 million individuals 15 years of age or younger are chronically infected with HCV (Nwaohiri 2018), 
(European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) 2018). 
2.1.1.2.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The primary mechanism of HCV infection in children is vertical transmission, with parenteral transmission 
secondary. Following vertical transmission of HCV, in the absence of treatment, approximately 20% to 40% 
of children clear the infection spontaneously, usually in the first 4 to 7 years of life, whereas the remaining 
60% to 80% develop chronic infection that persists into adulthood (Mack 2012), (Indolfi 2018). 
2.1.1.3.  Clinical presentation 
The natural history of chronic HCV infection in children is generally similar to that in adults, although HCV 
infection in children is typically relatively mild (Squires 2017). Most children chronically infected with HCV are 
asymptomatic or have mild, nonspecific symptoms. Clinical symptoms are present in approximately 20% of 
children in the first 4 years of life, with hepatomegaly being the most frequent sign (10%). Many, but not all, 
perinatally-infected children will have intermittently or persistently abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
or aspartate aminotransferase levels, particularly in the first 2 years of life. In children with vertical HCV 
infection who have undergone liver biopsy, the histological spectrum is usually mild, although severe liver 
disease is encountered {Mohan 2010}. Despite the overall more favourable prognosis compared with adults, 
approximately 4% to 6% of children with chronic HCV infection have evidence of advanced fibrosis or 
cirrhosis and some children eventually require liver transplantation as a consequence of HCV infection (Hu 
2010), (Wirth 2012). In addition, HCV infection has been reported to negatively affect both the health-related 
quality of life and cognitive functioning of paediatric patients (Nydegger 2008), (Rodrigue 2009), (Abu 
Faddan 2015), (Annunziato 2017). 
2.1.1.4.  Management 
The goal of HCV treatment in both paediatric and adult populations is viral eradication, thereby preventing 
progressive hepatic inflammation, hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver failure that result in the need for liver 
transplantation. Over the past 7 years, the development and approval of safe and effective direct-acting 
antivirals (DAAs) have transformed the treatment and course of HCV infection in adults. Several DAA 
therapies containing sofosbuvir have been approved for the treatment of adults with chronic HCV infection 
(Sovaldi, Harvoni, Epclusa and Vosevi).

2.1.2.  About the product 
Epclusa was approved in 2016 for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in adults.  It is a fixed dose 
combination of sofosbuvir, an HCV polymerase inhibitor, and velpatasvir, an NS5A-inhibitor.  It is 
pangenotypic, indicated regardless of HCV genotype.   
Type of Application and aspects on development 
In the EU, a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) for SOF/VEL was agreed on 08 May 2015 (EMEA-001646-
PIP01-14). Minor modifications to the original PIP have been agreed since that time, most recently on 18 May 
2018 (EMEA-001646-PIP01-14-M02). The design of GS-US-342-1143 reflected the PIP Decision agreed with 
the Paediatric Development Committee (PDCO) as part of the assessment of the PIP. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
This application is a line extension to the already approved Epclusa 400 mg/100 mg film-coated tablets. This 
line extension involves the addition of a 200/50 mg strength film-coated tablets and an extension of 
indication.  
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing 200 mg sofosbuvir and 50 mg velpatasvir 
as active substances. 
Other ingredients are:  
Tablet core: copovidone, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate. 
Film-coating: polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide (E171), polyethylene glycol, talc and iron oxide red (E172). 
The product is available in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with a polypropylene child-resistant 
closure containing 28 film-coated tablets with polyester coil as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance – Sofosbuvir, Velpatasvir 
General information 
This application is a line extension and contains the same active substances, sofosbuvir and velpatasvir, used 
to manufacture the already-approved film-coated tablets. The information presented by the Applicant in the 
dossier was already assessed in the original submission and includes updates from any subsequent 
variations. The active substances are sourced from the same manufacturers, are manufactured by the same 
processes and are released in accordance with the same active substance specifications.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Epclusa 200 mg/50 mg film-coated tablets are pink, oval-shaped, film-coated tablets of dimensions 14 x 7 
mm, debossed on one side with “GSI” and “S/V” on the other side.  
The aim of development was to identify a lower strength solid oral dosage form for use in paediatric patients. 
Development was based on the already approved 400/100 mg film-coated tablets, including the use of the 
same manufacturing process, adapted to the smaller tablet size, utilizing the identical formulation 
composition that is dose-proportional. Subsequent to the commercialization of the 400/100 mg strength, the 
reduced-strength 200/50 mg tablet was developed for use by paediatric patients unable to swallow a larger 
tablet. The 200/50 mg tablet was used to support Phase 2 paediatric studies and primary stability studies. 
The qualitative composition of the 200/50 mg film-coated tablets and existing Epclusa 400/100 mg film-
coated tablets is identical. The quantitative composition for the 200/50 mg film-coated tablets is proportional 
to the existing Epclusa 400/100 mg film-coated tablets for all the components. The dose strengths can be 
differentiated by different sizes, shape and dimensions. 
The active substances are the same as those used in the approved higher strength tablets. Velpatasvir free 
base is a stable amorphous solid, no stable crystalline forms have been isolated. It exhibits pH-dependent 
solubility over the physiological pH range of 2 to 8. Velpatasvir solubility increases with decreasing pH. 
Velpatasvir is considered to have low solubility and low apparent intestinal permeability based on low oral 
bioavailability (BCS class IV).  
Sofosbuvir is a crystalline solid, routinely manufactured as the most stable polymorphic form containing small 
quantities of an equivalent polymorphic form. Sofosbuvir exhibits pH-independent solubility across the 
physiological pH range. Sofosbuvir is highly soluble but has low apparent intestinal permeability (BCS class 
III).  
The excipients used in the 200/50 mg film-coated tablets are the same as those used in the 400/100 mg 
film-coated tablets and their compatibility with the active substance was demonstrated in stability studies. 
They are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. Standards, 
except for the film-coating material, Opadry II Pink tested according to an in-house standard. There are no 
novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of 
the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The dissolution method is the same as used for the already-approved 400/100 mg film-coated tablets.  
The existing 400 mg/100 mg tablets and 200 mg/50 mg tablets are both manufactured using the same 
manufacturing process train. The manufacturing process for VEL SDD was assessed in connection with the 
approval of Epclusa tablets, 400 mg/100 mg. No new information is provided in this application and no 
further assessment is made at this stage.  
The manufacturing process for the 200 mg/50 mg tablets was developed and optimized at the proposed 
manufacturing site. The development and optimization of the manufacturing process involved a tablet 
compression study and a film-coating study to define the commercial process parameters. The results of 
these studies were used to establish proposed targets and PARs for the commercial process. For the drying 
and dry granulation steps, the manufacturing processes and associated operating parameters were within the 
ranges defined in the current SOF/VEL tablet, 400 mg/100 mg, process and no additional work was 
Assessment report  
EMA/379603/2020 
Page 11/53 
  
  
conducted. A confirmation study was performed to verify the suitability of the dry granulation process 
parameter ranges for the SOF/VEL tablet, 200 mg/50 mg. The parameter ranges used in these studies are 
considered as PARs and were summarized in the dossier. 
The primary packaging is HDPE bottle and a polypropylene (PP) continuous thread child-resistant cap lined 
with an induction activated aluminium foil liner. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The 
choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended 
use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of two parts: manufacture of velpatasvir spray-dried dispersion (VEL-
SDD) and then production of the film-coated tablets. 
The first part of the manufacturing process (manufacture of VEL-SDD) consists of four main steps: feed 
solution preparation, drying, secondary drying, and packaging of VEL SDD.  
The manufacturing process for the VEL-SDD is identical to that used for the approved 400/100 mg film-
coated tablets. The controls applied to the VEL-SDD intermediate have previously been assessed in the 
context of the original MAA and are considered appropriate. 
The tablet manufacturing process consists of three main steps: (1) powder processing (dispensing, blending, 
and dry granulation), (2) tablet compression, and (3) film-coating of tablet cores to yield film-coated tablets. 
IPCs are carried out to monitor the critical steps of the manufacturing process. The IPCs are adequate for this 
type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality 
in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this film-coated tablet manufacturing 
process. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: appearance, 
identity (UPLC, UV), water content (Ph. Eur., USP), assay (UPLC), degradation products (UPLC), uniformity of 
dosage units (Ph. Eur., USP), dissolution (Ph. Eur., USP) and microbiological enumeration (Ph. Eur., USP). 
The specification for the 200 mg/50 mg tablets utilizes the same tests and acceptance limits as approved for 
Epclusa film-coated tablets, 400 mg/100 mg. The proposed specification is considered acceptable. 
The potential presence of class 1, 2A and selected class 3 elemental impurities in the finished product has 
been assessed on a risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch 
analysis data on seven representative pilot scale batches and three primary stability batches using a 
validated method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was not detected above 
30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data it can be concluded 
that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls. The information on the control of 
elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
Assessment report  
EMA/379603/2020 
Page 12/53 
  
  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
The finished product is released onto the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
A risk assessment concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities was performed for the finished product 
based on the combined recommendations from health authorities, including EMA communication 
EMA/189634/2019; it was concluded that there is no risk related to the presence of nitrosamine impurities in 
the product. Therefore, no changes to the control strategy for Epclusa are necessary to mitigate potential 
contamination by nitrosamines. The nitrosamine impurities risk assessment of the finished product included 
evaluating contributions from sofosbuvir and velpatasvir active substances, VEL spray-dried dispersion, 
excipients, finished product manufacturing facilities, and packaging components.  
Batch analysis results are provided for four production scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 production scale batches 200/50 mg film-coated tablets stored for up to 6 months under 
long term conditions (30 ºC / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% 
RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. Samples were 
tested for appearance, water content, assay, degradation products, dissolution, total aerobic microbial count, 
total combined yeasts and moulds count, and Escherichia coli. No significant changes were observed to any of 
the measured parameters under any conditions and the results were comparable to the data from the 
approved 400/100 mg film-coated tablets at each time-point. 
A further consideration is that the already-marketed 400/100 mg film-coated tablets have a 48-month shelf-
life based on extensive stability data which revealed little or no change in any of the measured quality 
attributes, and that the two strengths of tablet are manufactured from a common blend. Photostability data 
was generated for the 400/100 mg film-coated tablets indicating that Epclusa film-coated tablets are not 
photosensitive. Additional stability data reveals that the product is not impacted by freezing or temporary 
exposure to high temperature (60 ºC), which means that temperature excursions outside the normal 
temperature range which may be encountered during shipping will not have an adverse effect on product 
quality. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 4 years without any special storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. Satisfactory information has been provided in 
regard of the new presentation intended for treatment of paediatric patients. The applicant has applied QbD 
principles in the development of the finished product and their manufacturing process. However, no design 
spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process of the active substance, nor for the finished product. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of the 200mg/50mg film-coated tablet is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance 
with the conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform 
clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical studies have been submitted for this procedure. 
2.3.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Regarding the ecotoxicological aspects of Epclusa, the environmental risk assessment (ERA) for SOF has been 
conducted for its major metabolite (GS-331007) with the conclusion that the use of SOF is not expected to 
pose a risk to the environment.  
No conclusion on the environmental risk of VEL was made for Epclusa as VEL has been found to be persistent 
in sediments and there was data missing on the potential for bioaccumulation in sediment-dwelling 
organisms. This was to some extent resolved with a study on bioaccumulation in sediment-dwelling benthic 
oligochaetes (OECD TG315, a study with adult Lumbriculus variegatus that is considered to provide 
indications of bioaccumulation potential) in procedure EMEA/H/C/004210/IB/0013. The outcome was a 
normalized BAF of 0.122, indicating that VEL is rapidly eliminated and has very little potential for 
bioaccumulation in sediment-dwellers. That being said, as no definite equilibrium or kinetic bioaccumulation 
factor (BAFss; BAFk) could be determined in the study and as there are (at the present time) no formal 
criteria for bioaccumulation for OECD TG315 data, some uncertainty remains.

Dataset 
Three Phase 2 studies (GS-US-334-1112, GS-US-337-1116 and GS-US-342-1143) in pediatric subjects with 
chronic HCV infection were used in the population PK modeling and are presented in the table below. Study 
GS-US-334-1112 evaluated SOF (administered once daily) + RBV for a treatment duration of 12 or 24 weeks 
in subjects aged 3 to < 18 years old with chronic genotype 2 or 3 HCV infection. Study GS-US-337-1116 
evaluated LDV/SOF FDC (administered once daily) ± RBV for a treatment duration of 12 or 24 weeks in 
subjects aged 3 to <18 years old with chronic genotype 1, 3, 4, 5, or 6 HCV infection. Study GS-US-342-
1143 evaluated SOF/VEL FDC (administered once daily) for a treatment duration of 12 weeks in subjects 
aged 6 to < 18 years with chronic HCV infection. PK sampling included a combination of intensive and sparse 
sampling. After all exclusions, a total of 69 subjects in Study GS-US-334-1112, 160 subjects in Study GS-US-
337-1116, and 148 subjects in Study GS-US-342-1143 had at least one measurable SOF concentration value 
included in the SOF joint model population PK analysis. A total of 70 subjects in Study GS-US-334-1112, 197 
subjects in Study GS-US-334-1116, and 148 subjects in Study GS-US-334-1143 had at least one 
concentration value for GS-566500 included in the population PK analysis. A total of 85 Subjects in Study GS-
US-334-1112, 198 subjects in Study GS-US-337-1116, and 153 subjects in Study GS-US-342-1143 had at 
least one concentration value for GS-331007 included in the population PK analysis. 
The population PK data included 173 subjects from Study GS-US-342-1143 for VEL. After all exclusions, a 
total of 153 subjects in Study GS-US-342-1143 had at least one measurable concentration value for VEL.

Table 2 Phase 2 studies (GS-US-334-1112, GS-US-337-1116 and GS-US-342-1143) in paediatric 
subjects with chronic HCV infection used in the population PK modelling 
SOF popPK model development 
A previously developed PopPK models using 2 of the 3 studies (GS-US-334- 1112 and GS-US-337- 1116) was 
updated with data from GS-US-342-1143 also included in the dataset. The structural model is a joint model 
for parent and metabolites, depicting the metabolism of SOF to the intermediate metabolite, GS-566500, 
which is subsequently metabolized to and cleared from the body as GS-331007, is illustrated in figure below 
(Figure 1). The model included, a priori, the effect of baseline WT (allometric exponents fixed to 0.75 and 1 
for clearances and volumes, respectively) on CLSOF, VSOF, CL500, V500, CL007, and Vc007. Based on 
previous population PK analysis and the expected effect of LDV, VEL, and RBV on the PK of SOF and its 
metabolites, the model also included (a priori) coadministration of LDV and VEL separately on SOF F1 and 
coadministration of RBV on CL500and CL007. Following the covariate search, statistically significant 
covariates of age on CL500and CL007and also sex on CL007were included in the model. Bootstrap 
resampling techniques were used to evaluate the model stability and confidence interval (CI) of the final 
parameter estimates (Table 5). This model evaluation consisted of repeatedly fitting the model to a large 
number (n= 1000) of bootstrap replicates of the dataset.

VEL popPK model development 
A previous popPK model developed for VEL based on adult data was used as a starting point. The model was 
a 2-compartment model with first-order absorption, first-order elimination from the central compartment, 
and an absorption lag time (ALAG) (Figure 2). The model was updated using the updated dataset with data 
from Study GS-US-342-1143 added. The effect of WT on CL/F and Vc/F were included using fixed allometric 
exponents of 0.75 and 1, respectively. No additional covariates were included in the updated model. 
Bootstrap resampling techniques were used to evaluate the model stability and confidence interval (CI) of the 
final parameter estimate (N=1000) (Table 6).

Model evaluation 
The pcVPC evaluated the ability of the model to reproduce the distribution of the data despite variable 
dosing/sampling regimens. Prediction-corrected visual predictive check simulations were performed as a 
validation of the final PopPK model. A total of 1000 replicates of the studies were simulated using the final 
PopPK model parameter estimates, the estimated subject-specific ETA, and the residual variability.  
The pcVPC of SOF plasma concentration-time profiles and its metabolites stratified by age group are shown in 
Figure 3. The pcVPC plots show that the final SOF joint PopPK model adequately predicted the central 
tendency and variability of plasma SOF, GS-566500, and GS-331007 concentrations in the paediatric patient 
population. 
The pcVPC of VEL plasma concentration-time profiles are shown Figure 4. The pcVPC plots show that the final 
VEL PopPK model adequately predicted the central tendency and variability of the plasma VEL concentrations 
in the pediatric patient population. The 5th percentile associated with the second bin in both age categories is 
found to be outside the 95% CI of the model-predicted 5th percentile; this is explained by few individual 
observations that deviate significantly from the overall population at that specific time interval.

Simulated exposures for SOF/VEL in paediatric subjects following the proposed WT-band based dosing 
regimen were largely contained within the range of exposure observed in the adult Phase 2/3 population. 
Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 exposures were inversely correlated with WT, with a percent change in SOF/GS-
331007 exposures ranging from −42.2% to +119% (relative to the median exposures) for subjects with 
extreme covariate values (ie, 5th and 95th WT percentile, respectively).

Weight based dosing 
Exposures within the adult range have been shown to be associated with high SVR rates, a favorable safety 
profile, and a lack of association between exposures and AEs.  
During the ongoing procedure, Gilead proposes an update to the dosing regimen to allow administration of 
the SOF/VEL400/100mg tablet to children weighing ≥ 30kg in lieu of limiting treatment to those weighing ≥35 
kg. Gilead believes the data presented herein supports the lower weight band and does not impact the safety 
profile of SOF/VEL in pediatric patients within the 30 to 35kg weight range. The CHMP agreed to assess this 
new data within the current extension. The simulations presented below and the accompanying changes to 
the SmPC to incorporate the 30 kg cut-point and ensure a greater proportion of children in the 30 to <35kg 
weight range have VEL Ctau values within the range of those observed in the adult population. Simulated 
exposures of SOF, GS-331007, and VEL in children weighing ≥30  kg administered SOF/VEL 400/100mg and 
children weighing 17 to <30 kg administered SOF/VEL 200/50mg are shown graphically in Figure 9, Figure 
10, and Figure 11, respectively along with their corresponding comparison to the observed exposures in 
adults in Table 7, Table 8, and Table 9, respectively. These comparisons show that administration of the 
400/100mg dose to children weighing >30 kg will decrease the percentage of children (in the applicable 
weight band of 30 to 40 kg) with Ctau values below the 5th percentile of adults from 12% to 4% for VEL. A 
modest increase is projected in the percentage of children with AUCtau and Cmax above the 95th percentile of 
adults for all analytes (SOF, GS-331007, and VEL).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
A population PK analysis was performed where all sofosbuvir data has been pooled, and a joint model of SOF 
and metabolites and a separate popPK model for VEL were developed. Adequate non-linear mixed effects 
modelling methods have been used.  
There is a slight overprediction of SOF trough concentration in the paediatric subjects, which would result in 
more conservative estimates of exposures with respect to safety. There is also a slight underprediction of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/379603/2020 
Page 29/53 
  
  
 
 
absorption phase for GS-566500 in the 12 < 18-year-old age group. However, overall the model diagnostics 
indicate that the sofosbuvir model adequately represents the observed data in the paediatric population and 
the model is considered adequate to use in simulations to support the dose selection. 
The population PK simulated exposures metrics have been compared with the corresponding observed 
exposure ranges in the adult population.  
The CHMP considered that the AUC and Cmax for SOF are higher than the adult exposures. However, much 
higher exposures in adults with renal impairment have been observed with no dose adjustment required. 
Overall, given the safety profile of SOF and associated metabolites, the exposure levels in the paediatric 
population are acceptable.  
Simulated velpatasvir exposures were similar to the ones in adults. Patients with extreme covariate values 
had 81 % higher Cmax and 75 % higher AUC. Based on a favourable clinical safety profile, these changes in 
exposure for VEL are not deemed clinically significant. 
During this procedure, the applicant proposed an update to the dosing regimen to allow administration of the 
SOF/VEL400/100mg tablet to children weighing ≥ 30kg instead of the previously proposed ≥35 kg weight cut 
off. The simulations for the new proposed weight cut-off show that administration of the 400/100mg dose to 
children weighing >30 kg will decrease the percentage of children in the weight band of 30 to 40 kg with 
Ctau values below the 5th percentile of adults from 12% to 4% for VEL. Since dosing in the paediatric study 
was based on age rather than weight, low weight subjects in group 1 achieved high exposures, and high 
weight subjects in group 2 quite low exposures. The high exposures seen in children at low weight subjects 
did not seem to be associated with any specific safety concerns in this study. Overall, the slightly higher 
exposures expected with regards to this change of weigh cut off from ≥ 30kg instead of ≥35 kg, are 
considered unlikely to have a relevant impact on the safety profile, having in mind the wide therapeutic index 
for sofosbuvir and velpatasvir. To simplify the safety follow-up, a specific subsection on AEs reported for the 
paediatric population will be presented in coming PSURs, with adequate narratives to allow for a proper 
assessment. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the population PK analysis provides an adequate description of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir exposure 
in children 6-18 years of age. Given the range of weight bands studied and no data on posology in patients 
below 17 kg, the CHMP considered that the product use should be limited to patients aged 6 years and older 
and weighing at least 17 kg.

2.5.1.2.  Results  
Two subjects in group 2 did not take tablets but were treated with the granule formulation. The efficacy 
evaluation therefore concerns 71/73 in group 2. The SVR12 rate is high, in line with that seen in the adult 
population.

Group 1: 5/102 patients did not achieve SVR12. 1 subject relapsed, she stopped treatment at day 29 due to 
pregnancy. 4 subjects were categorized as “Other”. 3 subjects were “lost to follow-up”. All 3 completed 
therapy, had rapid viral responses and were negative at EOT, but did not come back for the planned follow-
up visits EOT. 1 subject (TE) was pending a posttreatment Week 12 visit at the time of analysis. 
Group 2: 5/71 subjects did not achieve SVR12. 1 had “non-response” (10 year-old white female). Although 
compliance was 100% according to pill count, viral load over time indicating low adherence (including stop of 
therapy for a period from week 1 to week 4). 4 subjects were categorized as “other”. As for group 1, 3 were 
“lost to follow-up”: all 3 completed therapy, with rapid adequate response to treatment. One did not return 
after EOT, 2 had SVR4 and did not return for the 3 months follow-up. The fourth subject did not return after 
the BL visit. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
While the study treatments (dosing) were based on age, the dosing schedule that is proposed as part of the 
application, is based on weight, which is considered a more adequate parameter. This is supported by the 
weight baseline data in the in the two age groups. Of note, at least some subjects in group 2 (200/50 mg qd) 
had a baseline weight where the adult dose (400/100 mg) would appear more adequate. However, the study

data showed no true virological failures. Conversely, some subjects in group 1, with a low weight, were given 
the adult dose. However, the safety data in the study were re-assuring and did not raise any concerns.  
In summary, although it is apparent that dosing by weight is more reasonable, the overall data confirm the 
wide therapeutic index of the drugs, both efficacy and safety wise.  
The SVR12 rate in adolescents (dosed 400/100 mg) and children 6- <12 (dosed 200/50 mg) was around 
95%, fully in line with results obtained in adults, despite the fact that a proportion of the younger group (with 
a higher weight for their age) achieved a lower dose. 
The children studied had mild disease characteristics; however, this is considered typical of the paediatric 
population. Different HCV subtypes were represented, which the CHMP considered reassuring. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The CHMP concluded that SOF/VEL is effective in the treatment of chronic HCV in children aged 6 years and 
older and weighing at least 17 kg.

2.6.1.  Patient exposure 
Subjects 12 to < 18 Years 
The mean (SD) duration of exposure to SOF/VEL for subjects 12 to < 18 years old in Group 1 was 12.0 
(0.80) weeks, and 99.0% of subjects (101 of 102) received SOF/VEL for 12 weeks. 
Subjects 6 to < 12 Years 
The mean (SD) duration of exposure to SOF/VEL for subjects 6 to < 12 years old in Group 2 was 11.7 (1.90) 
weeks, and 94.5% of subjects (69 of 73) received SOF/VEL for 12 weeks.  
2.6.2.  Adverse events 
Treatment was to be well tolerated, and severe AEs distinctly uncommon.  In group 1, 1 subject experienced 
Grade 3 suicidal ideation, and 1 experienced Grade 3 suicidal ideation and worsening of bipolar disorder II 
and Grade 4 suicide attempt; these AEs were assessed as not related. In group 2, the grade 3 AE concerns a 
case with auditory hallucinations, judged as related to treatment by the investigator.

2.6.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were two cases of SAEs in group 1, both considered treatment unrelated. One subject, with attention 
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (treated with lisdexamfetamine, Vyvanse) experienced a Grade 3 SAE of suicidal 
ideation, assessed as not related to study drug on Day 55, which resolved on Day 57 without interruption of 
study drug. One patient had an ongoing Grade 3 SAE of exacerbated bipolar disorder II on Day 1 of the study 
and a Grade 3 SAE of suicidal ideation on Day 69 of the study, which resolved 12 days later on Day 80. On 
Day 75, the subject had a Grade 4 SAE of suicide attempt. The SAEs were assessed as not related to study 
drug and there was no interruption of the study drug. Medical history of ongoing bipolar disorder II, frequent 
suicidal thoughts, anorexia, bulimia, emotional abuse, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and oral and 
receptive language disorders, and a prior history of suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and sexual abuse.  
There were two cases of SAEs in group 2. One subject with a medical history of ongoing chronic constipation 
experienced a Grade 2 SAE of constipation on Day 3, which was assessed as not related to study drug. 
Resolved day 5, after in-ward treatment. The SAE was considered treatment unrelated. One subject with a 
medical history of asthma, seasonal allergies, allergic shiners experienced “negative thoughts” (grade 2) and 
a grade 3 SAE of “auditory hallucinations”, assessed as related to study drug by the investigator.

AEs and drug levels 
Sofosbuvir levels in the paediatric patients in study GS-US-342-1143 are well covered by levels seen in 
patients with severe renal impairment, studied without particular safety issues. The main metabolite is not 
higher in the paediatric population than in adults with normal renal function. 
Velpatasvir levels are higher in the lower age spans in group 1 and 2 as compared to levels seen in the adult 
population. These levels are not increased in the adult special populations (neither in those with severe renal 
impairment (not studied at large), nor in those with severely impaired liver function (studied at large), i.e. 
“not covered” by adult safety data. 
Summary statistics of SOF and VEL exposure parameters by the presence or absence of common AEs by age 
groups are shown in Figure 12, Figure 13, Figure 14 and Figure 15 below (SOF for group 1 and 2, followed by 
VEL for group 1 and 2, respectively). No relevant differences in exposures by presence or absence of the 
common AEs (headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting or cough) are seen.

Psychiatric AEs and drug levels 
Considering the more severe psychiatric events reported in a small number of subjects, details for subjects 
with reported Psychiatric Disorders are summarized in Table 16 and Table 17 below. With the exception of 
the cases already discussed, events are of grade 1, with a scattered pattern of terms, and without any 
indication for a disproportional proportion with markedly high VEL exposures.

2.6.4.  Laboratory findings 
When looking at maximum graded toxicity below, it should be noted that no clinically meaningful changes 
from baseline in hemoglobin, reticulocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, or platelets were observed for subjects 
12 to < 18 years old (Table 18). The grade 3 Hemoglobin concerns a subject with thalassemia, the grade 3 
neutrophils concern subjects with low neutrophils at baseline, grade 3 CK followed heavy exercise and grade 
3 glucose a subject with diabetes. 
Similarly, no clinically meaningful changes from baseline in hemoglobin, reticulocytes, neutrophils, 
lymphocytes, or platelets were observed for subjects 6 to < 12 years old, and no grade 3 or 4 max lab 
toxicity was seen in this group.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No adolescent subjects (group 1) discontinued or interrupted therapy due to AEs. Two subjects in group 2 
discontinued due to AEs: one refused to take the treatment and the other case concerned the subject with 
auditory hallucinations, discussed above.  
Assessment report  
EMA/379603/2020 
Page 42/53 
  
  
 
2.6.5.  Discussion on clinical safety 
SOF/VEL therapy was well tolerated in study GS-US-342-1143, despite the study design (dosing by age) 
which led to quite high exposures in some subjects (e.g. low weight for age, dosed 400/100 mg). Grade 3 or 
4 AEs were very uncommon and only in one case (grade 3) considered related to therapy. Laboratory tests 
did not reveal any issues of concern. 
In the 173 treated with the tablet formulation, serious adverse events were reported in 4 patients. 
In age group 12-17 (n= 102) there were 1 case of suicidal ideation, not considered related to treatment by 
the investigator, which was endorsed by the CHMP, as there were alternative causes for the event. The other 
event concerned suicidal ideation and a suicide attempt. The investigator assessed these events as 
potentially triggered by starting hep C therapy and being part of the study, but not to the treatment per se. 
That conclusion was endorsed by the CHMP. In age group 6- <12 (n= 71 plus), an event of “negative 
thoughts (grade 2), followed by “auditory hallucinations” was reported in one patient, but the CHMP 
concluded that there was not sufficient evidence to conclude on a causal relationship. Update of the Product 
Information was not deemed necessary at this point. 
With regards to psychiatric AEs overall, terms other than “headache” are uncommon, and with no distinct 
pattern. 
2.6.6.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety assessment of Epclusa in paediatric patients aged 6 years and older is based on data from a phase 
2, open-label clinical study that enrolled patients who were treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks. 
The adverse reactions observed were consistent with those observed in clinical studies of Epclusa in adults. 
The CHMP recommended that future PSURs of Epclusa should include a specific subsection on AEs reported in 
the paediatric population, with adequate narratives to allow for a meaningful assessment.

Risk minimisation measures 
The MAH has updated the study title for HCC emergence PASS for the important potential risk “Emergence of 
HCC”, in line with changes made in Part III of the RMP. The Part VI, Annex 2 (Tabulation Summary of 
Planned, Ongoing, and Completed Pharmacovigilance Study Program) and Annex 3 (Protocols for Proposed, 
Ongoing and Completed Studies in the Pharmacovigilance Plan) were updated accordingly, in line with the 
updated Part III of the RMP.  
Two minor improvements were also made in the RMP, addressing the following minor updates which were being 
requested for consistency purposes only: 
-  In  Table  1 1  Planned  and  Ongoing  Studies  of  Annex  2,  the  date  of  “submission of  updated  joint  protocol” 
regarding De Novo DAA PASS was amended from 29 March 2019 (date of version 3 of the protocol) to 02 April 
2019 (date of submission); 
- In Annex 8 – Summary of changes to the risk management plan over time, the MAH has added the procedure 
number “EMEA/H/C/004210/X/0043/G” in the column “Approval date procedure” and the sentence “No changes 
to safety concerns.” at the end of the subsection “Safety specification” of the column “Changes” of the update 
of the RMP (version 5.1). 
This is endorsed.

2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has 
been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Epclusa (sofosbuvir / velpatasvir) is included in 
the additional monitoring list as it had a PASS imposed at the time of authorisation.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Around 70 million individuals worldwide are chronically infected with HCV. Around 3.5 million children aged 1 
to 19 years has been estimated to be infected, mainly in low to middle income countries, including Pakistan, 
Egypt, Nigeria, China, and Russia (in order of decreasing prevalence). 
The natural history of chronic HCV infection in children is relatively benign. Most children are asymptomatic 
or have mild nonspecific symptoms; cirrhosis development within childhood/adolescence is rare but has been 
reported. In the general case, it takes decades to develop cirrhosis.  
The HCV has significant genetic (RNA sequence) variability; 8 major genotypes have been identified: 
genotypes 1, 3 and 4 are the most prevalent globally. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Highly effective DAA regimens and well tolerated DAA regimens have been available for adults for around 5 
years. Some of them have recently been approved for the treatment of adolsecents and children. At present 
none of the regimens that are available have a pangenotypic effect; Epclusa is indicated for the treatment of 
HCV regardless of genotype.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
GS-US-342-1143 is an ongoing study, evaluating SOF/VEL is adolescents (group 1), children aged 6 to <12 
(group 2) and children aged 3 to <6 (group 3). The present application concerns group 1 and 2, where 
Assessment report  
EMA/379603/2020 
Page 49/53 
  
  
adolescents were given the adult dose (400/100 mg qd) and those aged 6 to <12 half that dose (200/50 mg 
qd), provided by a new tablet. The treatment duration is the same as in adults, 12 weeks. A granule 
formulation has been developed for the very small ones (group 3); it was used by two subjects in group 2 
who were not able to handle tablets, and those two subjects are not part of the efficacy evaluation. 
Of note, since dosing was based on age rather than weight, low weight subjects in group 1 achieved high 
exposures, and high weight subjects in group 2 quite low exposures. 
In line with the expected, the children/adolescents had mild HCV infection (no cirrhotic subjects, when this 
was evaluated); 80% of subjects in group 1, and two thirds in group 2 had a baseline ALT level < 1.5 x ULN.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In practice all subjects achieved virological cure; SVR12 was achieved in 97/102 (95%) in group 1, and in 
66/71 (93%) in group 2. The majority of those few not achieving SVR12 fulfilled treatment, had an adequate 
on-treatment response and undetectable HCV-RNA at end of treatment, but failed to come back for the week 
12 follow-up visit. There was in practice no non-response or true relapse, despite the fact that some subjects 
achieved a low dose by weight (above). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
No uncertainties have been identified about favourable effects. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The treatment was well tolerated. Reported AEs were mainly mild (grade 1 or 2). Grade 3 AEs were reported 
for 2/175 treated subjects (1 possibly related) and a grade 4 AE was reported for one subject (not deemed 
related). AEs leading to stopping therapy were reported for two subjects, both in group 2, related to 1) not 
accepting tablet and 2) a case defined as auditory hallucinations of questionable causality. There was no 
obvious difference in SOF or VEL exposures in cases with or without the most commonly reported potentially 
treatment related AEs (headache, fatigue, nausea), despite the fact that a substantial proportion of subjects 
achieved high exposures as a consequence of dosing by age. In summary, the safety profile in groups 1 and 
2 was in line with that reported for adults. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Adequate population PK analyses of SOF and selected metabolites, and VEL, respectively, has been 
performed and the models are considered adequate to provide predicted exposure metrics in the paediatric 
population. There is a slight overprediction of SOF trough concentration in the paediatric subjects, which 
would result in more conservative estimates of exposures with respect to safety. 
Both SOF and VEL has a wide therapeutic index, both from an efficacy and safety perspective.  A pragmatic 
approach has therefore been chosen on the basis of results obtained in groups 1 and 2 in study GS-US-342-
1143, where the proposed dosing (200/50 mg qd for weights 17-30, and 400/100 mg (i.e. adult dose) for 
those above 30 kilo) results in higher exposures of SOF (but not major metabolite) and VEL in children at the 
lower end of the weight spans than that seen in adults. Having the well described efficacy and safety profiles

Page 50/53 
  
  
in mind, that is considered acceptable. Given the totality of knowledge on sofosbuvir and velpatasvir, this 
does not prompt any specific safety concerns.  
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
On basis of outcomes and PK in this fairly large paediatric study, and previous results in studies in adults, the 
proposed dosing schedule is supported. The higher exposures seen in children at low ends of the weight 
bands is not associated with any specific safety concerns. Of note, higher sofosbuvir exposures have been 
seen in studies of adults with severe renal insufficiency, for whom SOF/VEL is approved without dose 
adjustment.  
The CHMP considered that there are no data on posology in patients weighing less than 17 kg. This has been 
reflected in section 4.1 of the SmPC. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The described similarity of sofosbuvir, GS-331007, and velpatasvir PK in adults and children is considered 
sufficient to support the efficacy and safety results to the new paediatric population. The efficacy estimate 
(SVR12) showed a very high cure rate also in the paediatric setting and there were no indications of any age-
specific safety concerns.  
Given the natural course of chronic HCV infection in comparison to the high cure rate and favourable safety 
profile of SOF/VEL, the favourable effects outweigh the unfavourable effects. 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Epclusa is favourable. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality and safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Epclusa 200/50 mg film-coated tablets is favourable in the following indication: 
• 
Epclusa is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in patients aged 6 years 
and older and weighing at least 17 kg. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for Epclusa subject to the 
following conditions:

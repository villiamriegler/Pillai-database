1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Roche Registration Limited submitted on 25 April 2016 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Ocrevus, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 3 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to 
the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 26 June 2014.  
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Ocrevus is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis  
(RRMS).    
Ocrevus is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis 
(PPMS). 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated 
that ocrelizumab was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0143/2014 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0143/2014 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
Applicant’s request(s) for consideration 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance ocrelizumab contained in the above medicinal product to 
be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a 
medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
Scientific Advice 
The applicant received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 21 June 2007, 19 February 2009, 23

(CNS)  resulting  in  neurological  impairment  and  severe  disability.  With  the  present  application  the 
applicant intended to seek approval of ocrelizumab for the following indications: 
“Ocrevus is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis  
(RRMS).    
Ocrevus is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis 
(PPMS).” 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
MS  is  the  most  common  cause  of  serious  neurological  disability  in  young  adults.  It  is  estimated  that 
more than 2.3 million people have MS worldwide. While MS is a global disease, its prevalence increases 
with distance from the equator. The prevalence of MS is highest in North America and Europe (140 and 
108  per  100,000  respectively)  and  lowest  in  sub-Saharan  Africa  and  East  Asia  at  2.1  and  2.2  per 
100,000, respectively. 
MS  typically  begins  between  the  ages  of  20  to  40  years.  Overall,  women  are  affected  approximately 
twice  as often  as  men,  except in  individuals  with the  primary-progressive  form  of  the  disease,  where 
there  is  no  gender  prevalence  difference.  For  the  past  two  decades,  MS  has  been  clinically 
subcategorized  into  four  phenotypic  disease  patterns  distinguished  by  the  occurrence  and  timing  of 
episodes  of  transient  neurological  compromise  (relapses)  relative  to  disease  onset  and  disability 
progression:  relapsing-remitting  MS  (RRMS),  secondary  progressive  MS  (SPMS),  primary  progressive 
MS  (PPMS),  and  progressive-relapsing  MS  (PRMS).  A  recently  proposed  revision  to  this  classification 
discusses the potential to abandon the term PRMS as it is considered vague and overlapping with other 
disease  course  subtypes.  In  that  line  of  argument  PRMS  and  PPMS  should  therefore  no  longer  be 
considered  distinct  entities  but  rather  be  characterized  both  as  PPMS,  with  or  without  activity.  More

recently, it has been proposed that PPMS is not a separate entity but rather a part of the spectrum of 
progressive disease and as such RMS and PPMS can be considered closely related diseases. 
The  vast  majority  of  patients  (approximately  85%)  first  present  with  the  RRMS  form  (Lublin  et  al., 
2014), which usually later evolves into secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), whereas PPMS affects about 
15% of the patients. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
While the exact cause of MS is unknown, an autoimmune process has been implicated involving both a 
genetic predisposition and environmental triggers.  
The  neuropathology  of  the  disease  is  marked  by  an  aberrant  activation  of  specific  T  and  B  cells  that 
recognize  auto-antigens  (i.e.,  myelin)  expressed  in  the  CNS.  MS  relapses  are  considered  the  clinical 
expression of acute inflammatory focal lesions associated with an influx of inflammatory T cells into the 
CNS,  leading  to  breakdown  of  the  blood-brain  barrier,  followed  by  entry  of  B  cells  and  macrophages. 
This leads to oligodendrocyte loss, demyelination, axonal damage, and neuronal loss.  
In recent years there has been increasing evidence supporting the hypothesis that B cells may play a 
key role in the treatment of MS. Four possible mechanisms of B-cell associated pathophysiology in MS 
have been described: Presenting auto-antigens and co-stimulatory signals to activate T cells, secreting 
pro-inflammatory  cytokines  at  greater  relative  proportions  than  protective  cytokines,  producing  auto-
antibodies  which  may  cause  tissue  damage  and  activate  macrophages  and  NK  cells  and  creating 
meningeal  lymphoid  follicle-like  structures,  linked  to  microglia  activation,  local  inflammation  and 
neuronal loss in the nearby cortex. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation and diagnosis 
Diagnosis  of  MS  is  based  on  the  application  of  structured  diagnostic  criteria  that  rely  on  clinical 
observation, neurological examination, brain and spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, 
and  at  times  evoked  potentials,  and  cerebral  spinal  fluid  (CSF)  examination  (Polman  et  al.  2011). 
Prognosis  is  highly  variable  and  if  left  untreated,  half  of  patients  with  MS  require  assistance  to  walk 
within 15 years of disease onset (Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] 6).  
In  approximately 85%  of patients,  MS  begins  as  a  relapsing,  episodic disorder  with  gradual  complete 
or  incomplete  recovery  (RRMS).  If  left  untreated,  the  majority  of  these  patients  will  transition  to  a 
progressive  form  characterized  by  worsening  neurologic  disability  either  with  or  without  occasional 
super-imposed  relapses  (relapsing  or  non-relapsing  secondary  progressive  MS).  Relapsing  (forms  of) 
MS  (RMS)  is  used  to  describe  those  patients  with  either  RRMS  or  SPMS  who  continue  to  experience 
relapses.  Patients accumulate disability as a result of incomplete recovery from acute relapses and/or 
gradual disease progression. 
Advances  in  diagnostic  criteria,  greater  awareness  and  increased  availability  of  MRI  to  detect 
subclinical  disease  pathology  (such  as  T1  gadolinium  [Gd]-enhancing  and  T2  hyperintense  lesion 
burden,  have  made  the  early  diagnosis of  MS  a  reality.  RMS  diagnostic  criteria  rely  upon  the  general 
concept  of  white  matter  demyelinating  lesions,  separated  in  space  (i.e.,  in  different  anatomical 
locations  in  the  CNS)  and  time  (i.e.,  onset  of  sub-acute  to  acute  bouts  of  neurologic  dysfunction, 
separated  by  neurological  stability  or  improvement).  Pathologically,  MS  is  characterized  by  focal 
infiltrates  of  inflammation  (plaques)  in  the  CNS  which  lead  to  demyelination,  axonal  interruption  and 
neuronal degeneration. Clinically, MS attacks (or relapses) consist of transient episodes of neurological 
dysfunction  occurring  at  different  times  and  not  explained  by  other  etiologies,  such  as  infections, 
vascular  disorders,  or  other  autoimmune  disorders.  Several  clinical  variants  of  MS  have  been  defined 
on  the  basis  of  the  presence  and/or  frequency  of  relapses  and  the  pattern  of  progression  in 
neurological  disability.  Of  these,  RMS  has  been  the  most  intensively  studied  since  this  variant 
Assessment report  
EMA/790835/2017 
     Page 14/180 
 
 
 
 
comprises  the  largest  cohort  of  patients  and  is  the  population  where  treatments  have  demonstrated 
benefit  as  well  as  being  the  stage  of  disease  at  which  might  make  the  most  meaningful  impact  on 
ultimate disease progression. 
Primary progressive MS (PPMS) is a less common form of MS, accounting for approximately 10% of all 
cases  (approximately  40,000  individuals  in  the  US).  It  is  characterized  by  a  progressive  course  from 
disease  onset,  with  infrequent  superimposed  discrete  clinical  attacks  or  relapses.  The  mean  age  of 
onset  for  PPMS  is  approximately  40 years  and  men  are  affected  nearly  as  often  as  women.  In  PPMS, 
diagnostic criteria require that there is evidence of disease progression for at least one year from the 
first  symptoms,  plus  a  combination  of  lesions  in  brain  or  spinal  cord  and/or  presence  for  oligoclonal 
bands or elevated immunoglobulin (Ig)G index in CSF. 
Natural history studies of PPMS patients demonstrate a steadily disabling course from symptom onset.  
In a well-characterized cohort of PPMS patients from Ontario, Canada, the median time to the use of 
aids  for  ambulation  (Disability  Status  Scale  [DSS]  landmark  6)  was  8  years  and  the  median  time  to 
wheelchair use (DSS landmark 7) was under 20 years, which is twice as fast as from onset of RRMS.  
This  likely  reflects  the  absence  of  a  relapsing  phase  of  disease  as  the  age  at  which  higher  levels  of 
disability are achieved are comparable between subtypes despite the later age of onset in PPMS. The 
actual rate of progression of disability seems not to differ between subtypes, once steady progression 
of  disability  has  commenced.  A  higher  proportion  of  PPMS  patients  present  initially  with  motor 
impairment,  cerebellar  ataxia,  and  brainstem  symptoms  than  relapsing-onset  patients,  and  spastic 
paraparesis  is  a  common  early  clinical  presentation.  The  diagnosis  of  PPMS  utilizes  specific  criteria 
which include CSF abnormalities, CNS lesions separated in space, and continued disease progression – 
specifically,  clinical  evidence  that  the  disease  has  progressed  for  at  least  one  year  from  symptom 
onset. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Currently there is no cure for MS, but the aberrant activation of self-specific T and B cells observed in 
MS has been shown to be affected by immunomodulatory treatments, which can favourably alter the 
course of the disease. These therapeutic interventions are referred to as disease modifying drugs 
(DMDs) or disease modifying therapies (DMTs). The goal of treatment of RMS with DMDs is to reduce 
the rate and severity of relapses and to delay disease progression by preventing accumulation of 
disability. 
MS therapies also include treatment of relapses and symptomatic treatment applied to improve 
symptoms and complications caused by the disease, e.g. fatigue, spasticity, ataxia, walking disability, 
weakness, bladder and bowel disturbances, and cognition disturbances etc. As per the current 
treatment consensus acute relapses can be treated with corticosteroids and the standard of care is IV 
methylprednisolone. 
Currently in the EU there are number of approved DMDs for MS, each presenting with a different 
efficacy and safety profile. Long-standing injectable therapies in RMS include the interferon beta class 
(interferon beta-1a intramuscular [IM], interferon beta-1a subcutaneous [SC], interferon beta-1b SC) 
and glatiramer acetate, administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly at frequencies ranging from 
daily to once every other week. These treatments are generally considered safe but lack sufficient 
efficacy to impact the long-term disease course.  In the real world setting, suboptimal adherence due 
to side effects, injection anxiety and lack of perceived efficacy is also a recognized issue for many of 
these treatments. 
Other recently approved medicines like dimethylfumarate and teriflunomide are indicated for patients 
with RRMS and are considered to have modest efficacy (reduction of ARR approximately by 50% for 
Assessment report  
EMA/790835/2017 
     Page 15/180 
 
 
 
 
dimethylfumarate and by 30% for teriflunomide). Despite convenient way of administration (per os 
[p.o.] once or twice daily), these medications have a more complex safety profile. Teriflunomide 
reduces white blood cell count approximately by 15 % from baseline values, requires frequent 
monitoring of liver function and has very slow plasma elimination, which could take up to 2 years. 
Dimethylfumarate lowers lymphocyte counts by approximately 30% from baseline values and cases of 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have occurred in patients with moderate or severe 
prolonged lymphopenia. Daclizumab has been approved for patients with RMS and has shown a more 
significant efficacy (approximately 46% relative reduction of ARR). It also induces reduction of total 
lymphocyte, T and B cell counts on average ≤10% from baseline during the first year of treatment, and 
recently severe hepatotoxicity reactions have been reported. 
Alemtuzumab is indicated for ‘RRMS patients with active disease defined by clinical or imaging 
features’, while natalizumab and fingolimod have been approved for ‘highly active RRMS’.  Disease 
activity was defined based on clinical and MRI parameters with or without prior DMD. Alemtuzumab is 
administered as intravenous (IV) infusions during two treatment courses lasting 3-5 days each and 
separated by 12 months with safety follow up for 48 months after the last infusion (relative reduction 
of ARR by approximately 50%). Infusion related reactions, infections as well as autoimmune disorders 
including immune thrombocytopenia, nephropathies and thyroid disorders (up to 36% of treated 
patients) were reported in clinical trials with alemtuzumab. Alemtuzumab depletes T and B 
lymphocytes and total lymphocyte counts return to lower limit of normal by 6 months after the last 
infusion in 40% of patients. Natalizumab is administered as IV infusion every 4 weeks. It is very 
effective in highly active RRMS (relative reduction of ARR by approximately 70%). In contrast to other 
treatment alternatives in MS it is not inducing lymphopenia, but is associated with seriously increased 
risk of PML (varies from 0.1 to 10 per 1000 treated patient). Fingolimod is another alternative for 
patients with highly active RRMS (relative reduction of ARR by approximately 50-55%). However, it 
induces reduction of the peripheral lymphocyte count by approximately 70-80% from baseline value. 
Fingolimod is also associated with the occurrence of PML cases, basal cell cancer and serious cardiac 
adverse reactions including bradycardia, as well as cases of QT prolongation and atrioventricular block. 
Although there are several approved therapies for RMS, some lack sufficient efficacy to effectively 
reduce disability progression, while more effective therapies are often reserved for later use because 
they are associated with serious risks. Therefore, it can be summarized that there is still an unmet 
medical need in RMS for treatment options which are easy and convenient for the patient, e.g. short 
treatment courses, and which have high efficacy with a benign safety profile. 
No treatment has been demonstrated to significantly slow the progression of disability in patients with 
PPMS, including therapies approved for the treatment of RMS. A large Phase III, randomized, 
controlled trial with glatiramer acetate and smaller randomized, controlled clinical trials evaluating 
mitoxantrone, interferon beta-1a IM, and interferon beta-1b did not demonstrate significant impact on 
clinical progression in the PPMS population. In a Phase II/III randomized, placebo controlled clinical 
trial evaluating rituximab; a statistically significant treatment effect was not shown for the primary 
endpoint. Moreover, most recently, a Phase III placebo controlled trial of fingolimod in patients with 
PPMS failed to meet its primary endpoint.  
In the absence of any approved treatment for PPMS, a variety of unapproved agents including 
mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone or rituximab, in addition to other therapies 
approved for the treatment of RMS (e.g. interferon beta-1a or glatiramer acetate), are used in clinical 
practice despite the lack of Level 1 evidence. This exposes patients to risk without expected benefits. 
Currently, PPMS remains a severely disabling condition with no approved DMTs and where a high 
unmet medical need is recognized.

About the product 
Ocrelizumab is a recombinant, humanized immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that 
selectively targets CD20-expressing B cells. CD20 is a cell surface antigen found on pre-B cells and 
mature memory B cells, but it is not expressed on lymphoid stem cells and plasma cells. While 
ocrelizumab selectively depletes CD20-expressing B cells, the capacity of B-cell reconstitution and pre-
existing humoral immunity are preserved. In addition, innate immunity and total T-cell numbers are 
not affected. 
The precise mechanisms through which ocrelizumab exerts its therapeutic clinical effects in MS are not 
fully elucidated but involve immunomodulation through the reduction in the number and function of B 
cells. In vitro, binding of ocrelizumab to CD20 on target cells induces immune effector mechanisms 
such as antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity 
(ADCC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and apoptosis. In vivo, ocrelizumab selectively 
and effectively depletes CD20 B cells presumably through one or more of the mechanisms cited above.

Design Space is claimed at present.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
Ocrelizumab  is  a  humanized  monoclonal  antibody  based  on  the  human  immunoglobulin  G1  (IgG1) 
framework that contains heavy chain VHIII and light chain VκI subgroup sequences. The recombinant 
antibody  is  produced  in  Chinese  hamster  ovary  (CHO)  cells  and  consists  of  two  identical  213  residue 
light chains and two identical 451 or 452 residue heavy chains. 
The molecular formula of intact ocrelizumab is C6482H9952N1712O2 014S46. The calculated molecular mass 
of intact deglycosylated ocrelizumab is approximately 145,564 Da (peptide chains only, without heavy 
chain C-terminal lysine residues). 
The light and heavy chain sequences of ocrelizumab have been presented in the dossier. 
The CH2 domain of each heavy chain has a single conserved glycosylation site at Asn302. The N-linked 
oligosaccharides  of  ocrelizumab  are  typical  of  those  observed  on  other  CHO-produced  monoclonal 
antibodies.

The  C-terminal  lysine  residues  of  the  heavy  chains  (Lys452)  are  removed  by  the  action  of  basic 
carboxypeptidases during the cell culture process. 
Fourier  transform  infrared  spectroscopy  (FTIR)  confirmed  that  ocrelizumab  primarily  has  a  β-sheet 
structure, consistent with the structure of an IgG1 antibody. 
Intact  IgG1  antibodies  have  five  cysteine  residues  per  light  chain  involved  in  disulfide  linkages, 
including two intrachain disulfide linkages per light chain (Cys23-Cys87 and Cys133-Cys193) and one 
interchain  disulfide  linkage  (Cys213  of  the  light  chain-Cys225  of  the  heavy  chain).  Intact  IgG1 
antibodies have eleven cysteine residues per heavy chain involved in disulfide linkages. These linkages 
include  four  intrachain  bonds  per  heavy  chain  (Cys22-Cys96,  Cys149-Cys205,  Cys266-Cys326  and 
Cys372-Cys430),  two  disulfide  bonds  between  the  two  heavy  chains  (Cys231-Cys231  and  Cys234-
Cys234),  and  one  disulfide  bond  between  the  heavy  chain  and  the  light  chain  of  each  of  the 
heterodimers (Cys213 of the light chain-Cys225 of the heavy chain). 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Ocrelizumab  active  substance  is  manufactured  by  Genentech,  a  member of  the  Roche  Group,  at  New 
Horizons Way, Vacaville (VV), CA, USA. Storage of the active substance occurs in Basel, Switzerland.  
Description of the manufacturing process and process controls

Small-scale  models  were  used  in  the  process  characterisation  studies  to  guide  the  designation  of 
process  parameters  as  critical  or  not.  The  small-scale  models  used  for  the  fermentation-  and 
purification  process  of  ocrelizumab  active  substance  manufacturing  process  have  been  evaluated  to 
assure that they are representative of the full scale process. Characterisation of the ocrelizumab active 
substance  manufacturing  process  is  extensive  and  has  been  carefully  outlined  in  the  dossier.  Risk 
Ranking  and  Filtering  (RRF)  of  process  parameters  in  the  seed  train-,  in  the  inocolumn  train-,  in  the 
production fermenter-, in the harvest and in the centrifugation step have been detailed in the dossier. 
Based  on  the  identified  process  parameters,  process  characterisation  studies  have  been  designed  to 
evaluate  the  possible  impact  of  the  process  parameters  on  the  identified  ocrelizumab  Critical  Quality 
Attributes (CQAs). Uni- and Multivariate studies have been conducted to study the possible correlation 
between single Critical Process Parameters (CPPs) and CQAs as well as the combination of several CPPs 
on  the  CQAs.  Multivariate  studies  were  statistically  designed  experiments  (DoE).  Initial  DoE  studies 
aimed  at  understanding  main  effect  on  key  performance  indicators  (KPIs)  and  CQAs.  Based  on  the 
outcome  of  the  initial  DoE  in  some  cases  a  follow-up  study  was  performed  to  improve  process 
understanding  or  to  apply  process  knowledge  to  other  steps.  The  results  of  all  production  culture 
process characterisation/process validation (PC/PV) studies support the proposed acceptable ranges for 
the production process parameters.  
The  small-scale  characterisation-  and  validation  studies  designed  and  conducted  for  the  purification 
process  have  also  been  carefully  outlined  in  the  dossier.  PC/PV  studies  for  each  purification  step 
included  multivariate  studies  with  additional  univariate  studies  conducted  for  each  of  the 
chromatography  steps.  Multivariate  studies  were  either  statistically  designed  experiments  or  studies 
with  multiple  parameters  set  to  worst-case  conditions.  Initial  Design  of  Experiments  (DoE)  studies 
aimed  at  understanding  main  effect  on  KPIs  and  CQAs.  Based  on  the  outcome  of  the  initial  DoE  in 
some  cases  a  follow-up  study  was  performed  to  improve  process  understanding  or  to  apply  process 
knowledge to other steps. 
In  the  initial  submission  a  design  space  was  claimed  for the  active  substance  manufacturing  process. 
The design space claim was, however, withdrawn later in the evaluation process.  
Process validation and/or evaluation 
The proposed commercial process was demonstrated to be reproducible and produce active substance 
of  consistent  quality.  Data  generated  from  the  validation  batches  all  meet  the  predefined  validation 
study acceptance criteria as well as the proposed commercial acceptance criteria. 
The  active  substance  manufacturing  processes  have  been  evaluated  for  consistency  of  CQAs,  other 
quality attributes, and KPIs. 
Data  presented  also  support  that  material  produced  with  the  proposed  commercial  process  is  overall 
consistent with the clinical material (produced using previous versions of the manufacturing process).  
Removal  of  product-  and  process  related  substances  and  impurities,  as  well  as,  raw  materials  and 
leachables to a consistent and acceptable level has been demonstrated.  
In-process pool hold times have been appropriately evaluated. Reuse of the resins as well as the reuse 
of  the  ultra-diafiltration  (UFDF)  membrane  has  been  evaluated  in  small-scale  and  full  scale  studies. 
Data support the proposed reuse. 
The  shipping  qualification  studies  have  demonstrated  that  the  transport  processes  are  capable  of 
maintaining frozen drug substance inside the vessel at the appropriate storage condition. 
Manufacturing process development 
Ocrelizumab  has  a  long  clinical  and  manufacturing  development  history.    In  addition  to  the  intended 
commercial  process,  four  development  versions  of  the  process  have  been  used  over  time.  Data  from 
Assessment report  
EMA/790835/2017

the  various  comparability  studies  conducted  shows  a  difference  in  glycosylation  with  consequential 
differences in potency between early clinical, pivotal clinical and commercial process materials.  
Studies  concluded that  the  manganese  level in  the  production  cell  culture  medium  contributed  to  the 
glycosylation  differences  observed.  The  ocrelizumab  glycoform  distribution  is  sensitive  to  manganese 
(Mn)  levels  in  the  production  culture  medium.  Manganese  levels  in  the  production  medium  can  vary 
based on contributions from multiple sources. 
The  Applicant  explored  a  process  change  to  bring  the  commercial  process  material  more  in  line  with 
the pivotal clinical trial material.  
A  Major  Objection  was  however  raised  in  relation  to  the  proposed  process  change  and  the  Applicant 
was requested to provide further data.  
The Applicant responded that the strategy chosen by the Applicant was to not change the process but 
rather  control  the  Mn  level  in  the  cell  culture  medium.  This  proposal  was  found  acceptable  as 
comparability at the quality level between the material used for pivotal clinical studies and the material 
produced with the proposed commercial process is acceptably ensured. In addition, the Applicant has 
committed to provide further data to support the proposed approach once further experience has been 
gained. 
To  ensure  process  consistency,  two  measures  of  potency  testing  (CDC  and  ADCC),  as  well  as  the 
correlated glycan attributes (G0 and G0-F), are included on the control system. 
Characterisation 
The  predicted  masses  and  primary  structure  was  confirmed  by  orthogonal  methods:  Electrospray 
Ionisation-Mass  Spectrometry  analysis  (ESI-MS),  Liquid  Chromatography-MS  and  LC-UV  peptide 
mapping.  Endoproteinase  Lys-C  Peptide  map 
in  conjunction  with  high  performance 
liquid 
chromatography  (HPLC)  MS-MS  was  also  used  for  the  verification  of  the  primary  structure  and  the 
assignment of the disulfide bonds.  
Overall,  glycan  structures  consistent  with  those  found  in  CHO-derived  monoclonal  antibodies  and  all 
ocrelizumab glycans are found on other human immunoglobulins.  
The  oxidation  pattern  and,  where  applicable,  the  corresponding  functional  sites  has  been  studied 
through analysis of forced oxidized samples. The oxidation pattern was found to be consistent between 
the batches from different manufacturing process versions for ocrelizmab.  
Reduced  tryptic  peptide  maps  were  analysed  by  LC-MS.  The  level  of  deamidation  and  isomerization 
was generally low and consistent between batches.   
The  distribution  of  the  size  related  variants  of  ocrelizumab  was  found  to  be  consistent  between 
batches. 
The charge variants were characterised by orthogonal methods.  
The  biological  characterisation  covered the  combined  effector  functions of  ocrelizumab,  which  are  the 
different Fc mediated functions upon the binding to CD20 on the B-cells. 
The influence of different stress parameters on the biological activity of ocrelizumab has been studied.  
The biological activity of enriched fractions of variants for size, glycosylation, glycation, deaminidation, 
charge related variants and unpaired cysteine forms was analysed in detail.

Specification  
The  active  substance  specification  (methods  and  acceptance  criteria)  is  overall  acceptable.      The 
specification contains tests for pharmacopoeial methods as well as specific methods to ensure sufficient 
safety and quality with respect to identity, purity, quantity and potency. 
The  CQAs  that  are  important  for  ensuring  a  consistent  active  substance  quality  were  identified  using 
the QbD approach. Not all identified CQAs are subject to active substance release testing as they are 
controlled by other means (in-process controls or control of process parameters).  
For setting of individual CQA Acceptance Criteria (AC) the cumulative impact of all CQAs with regard to 
bioactivity and PK has been considered. For CQAs with safety and immunogenicity impact, the AC have 
been  justified  by  considering  clinical  experience  with  ocrelizumab  and  other  relevant  molecules 
developed  using  the  platform  process.  The  approach  has  its  main  focus  on  the  safety  and  efficacy 
impact of the CQAs.  
Analytical methods 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  appropriately  described.  All  methods  have  been  validated  in 
accordance with ICH Q2. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data of the active substance were provided. The results are within the specifications and 
confirm consistency of the manufacturing process. 
Reference materials 
Reference  standards  from  clinical  processes  have  been  established.  The  current  Primary  reference 
standard and Secondary reference standard are from the proposed commercial process. 
Acceptable information has been provided on the generation and testing of the reference standards.  
Stability 
A  shelf-life  of  36  months  has  been  proposed  and  agreed  for  the  active  substance.  The  shelf-life  is 
supported  by  real-time,  real-condition  stability  data.  Primary  stability  data  consist  of  six  active 
substance batches, including three validation batches and three representative clinical batches. 
Selected  analytical  methods  used  in  the  stability  study  have  been  justified  based  on  their  stability 
indicating properties. No significant changes have been introduced to the methods over time. 
The  data  presented  do  support  the  proposed  shelf-life.  All  results  met  the  acceptance  criteria  for  all 
parameters tested..

The excipients used are common for biopharmaceutical products. 
No  excipients  of  human  or  animal  origin  or  novel  excipients  are  used  in  the  manufacture  of 
ocrelizumab finished product. The excipients all comply with the specification of relevant monographs 
(Ph.Eur). 
Formulation development 
Formulation studies have been carefully outlined in the dossier. The robustness of the formulation has 
been established via a multivariate formulation study.  
For clinical studies carried out in the multiple sclerosis indication, the finished product formulation 1 as 
well as formulation 2 was used. However, non-clinical studies were performed using formulation 1.  
Formulation 1 and 2 mainly differ in relation to the concentration of ocrelizumab and excipients used. 
Both formulations use well known excipients for injectable biopharmaceuticals.  
Finished product process development 
Clinical material was manufactured at Genentech's Clinical Parenteral Manufacturing Facility (CPMF) in 
South San Francisco (SSF), California; Genentech Parenteral Manufacturing Facility (GPMF) in SSF; and 
Roche Diagnostics GmbH (RDG), Mannheim, Germany. The proposed commercial manufacturing site is 
RDG Mannheim.  
The  comparability  study  conducted  for  material  from  SSF  and  RDG  included  three  validation  batches 
from the commercial site (RDG), which were compared to the historical manufacturing ranges. All data 
were within the release criteria and thereby supported comparability of the finished product from the 
two sites. Comparability was further supported by comparisons of degradation rates and profiles from 
forced stability studies.  
Manufacturing process characterisation 
 A  detailed  description  of  the  development  of  the  finished  product  manufacturing  process  has  been 
provided. No Design Space has been claimed for the finished product manufacturing process, however, 
QbD tools have been used for the process development and characterisation. A number of small-scale 
studies have been conducted, which are further supported by the full-scale validation studies.  
Based  on  results  from  process  characterisation/development  and  validation  studies,  no  CPPs  were 
identified  for  the  buffer  preparation  and  pooling/dilution/mixing  processes.  No  significant  impact  on 
any  of  the  relevant  QAs  was  observed  during  studies  of  the  mixing  processes.  These  studies  support 
the process parameter ranges proposed. 
No quantifiable impact on any of the relevant QAs was measured during process characterisation and 
validation studies of the bioburden reduction or sterile filtration process. Based on results from process 
characterisation  and  validation  studies,  no  parameters  were  considered  to  be  CPPs  for  the  filling 
process. No significant impact on any of the relevant quality attributes was measured during studies of 
the filling process. 
Linkage-study 
The  results  from  the  two  manufacturing  scale  linkage  studies,  which  subjected  the  bulk  active 
substance  and  finished  product  to  several  cumulative  worst  case  stress  conditions  and  extended  hold 
times, demonstrated that the finished product unit operation is robust. 
Container closure system 
The  container  closure  system  consists  of  a  15  mL  Type  I  glass  vial  (Ph.Eur),  a  fluoro-resin-laminated 
liquid rubber stopper and an aluminium seal fitted with flip-off plastic cap. The results of extractables

and  leachables  studies  demonstrate  that  this  vial/stopper  configuration  is  suitable  for  use  with  the 
finished product. 
The  primary  packaging  components  are  made  of  commonly  used  materials  for  the  packing  of 
biopharmaceutical medicinal products. The components of the packing materials comply with relevant 
monographs (Ph.Eur.). Secondary packaging is a paperboard box and label.  
Microbiological attributes 
The  microbiological  quality  and  sterility  of  is  the  finished  product  is  controlled  by  a  combination  of 
measures: measurement of pre-filtration bioburden level, two serial steam-sterilized 0.22 µm pore size 
filters, use of depyrogenated and sterilised vials and stoppers, use of a validated capping and crimping 
process, test for sterility and endotoxin and closure integrity testing.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
RDG Mannheim is the manufacturer responsible for manufacture of the finished product, quality control 
testing,  batch  release  and  storage  of  finished  product  (unlabelled  vials).  F.  Hoffmann-La  Roche  Ltd., 
Kaiseraugst,  Switzerland  is  responsible  for  labelling,  secondary  packaging  and  storage  of  finished 
product. 
The  finished  product  manufacturing  process  starts  with  thawing  of  the  active  substance,  followed  by 
optional pooling, mixing, filtration and aseptic filling. Finished product filtration is performed by in-line 
sterile filtration during the vial filling process step.  
Finished  product  process  validation  was  performed  on  batches  manufactured  with  the  commercial 
process at the commercial site RDG Mannheim.  
All  analytical  release  data  met  the  specifications.  Stability  studies  of  the  validation  batches  were 
initiated  and  are  currently  ongoing.  The  validation  study  covered  thawing  of  active  substance,  buffer 
preparation and pooling/dilution/mixing, bioburden reduction filtration and in-line sterile filtration, hold 
times  and  process  times  for  finished  product  in  stainless  steel  vessels,  aseptic  filling,  capping  and 
crimping, final inspection of vials and filter validation. 
The process validation data demonstrate that the ocrelizumab finished product manufacturing process 
is robust and consistently yields finished product that meets the predetermined acceptance criteria of 
all quality attributes, and that the in-process tests are suitable to monitor the manufacturing process.  
Environmental monitoring, equipment validation and media fills have been addressed.  
Product specification 
The finished product specifications are generally found acceptable.  The specifications contain tests for 
pharmacopoeial methods as well as specific methods, covering appearance and description, general 
tests, identity, purity, endotoxins, quantity, potency, sterility and container closure integrity. 
Analytical methods 
The compendial methods have been verified for their intended use.  
The  finished  product  has  essentially  the  same  specifications  as  the  active  substance.  The  attributes 
that  are  specific  for  the  finished  product  are  all  pharmacopoeia  requirements  and  thereby  considered 
mandatory to test.  
Potency testing at finished product level is done by CDC bioassay.

Batch analysis 
Batch  analysis  data  for  the  finished  product  were  provided.  The  results  are  within  specifications  and 
confirm consistency of the manufacturing process. 
Reference materials 
The reference standard used for the finished product release and stability is the same as that used for 
the active substance. 
Stability of the product 
The commercial shelf life of the finished product is determined based on the long-term stability data of 
all  primary  batches  and  is  supported  by  the  accelerated,  stress,  and  additional  stability  studies 
performed.  The  data  provided  support  a  shelf  life  of  18  months  at  the  storage  condition  of  5°C 
(unopened vial).  
An  accelerated  stability  study  (25°C)  and  a  study  under  stressed  conditions  (40°C)  have  been 
conducted to support comparability between the materials from different processes (active substance) 
and formulations (finished product).  
The  photostability  study  demonstrated  that  the  finished  product  in  unprotected  vials  should  not  be 
exposed to intense light for prolonged periods and that the vials should be stored in the carton.  
A  compatibility  study  was  conducted  to  confirm  the  physicochemical  stability  of  diluted  solutions  of 
ocrelizumab stored in 0.9% sodium chloride solution under recommended in-use conditions. The study 
supported  the  proposed  in-use  stability  of  24  hours  at  2-8°C  and  subsequently  for  8  hours  at  room 
temperature  for  the  diluted  solution.  The  study  also  demonstrated  that  diluted  solutions  can  be 
administered  interchangeably  with  the  various  components  tested:  IV  bags  with  product-contacting 
surfaces of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyolefin (PO), polyethylene (PE), or polypropylene (PP); in-line 
filter  membranes  composed  of  polyethersulfone  (PES)  or  polysulfone  (PSU);  and  infusion  sets  and 
other  infusion  aids  composed  of  PVC,  PE,  polybutadiene  (PBD),  or  polyetherurethane  (PEU).  The 
diluted solutions should be administered by IV infusion with an in-line filter. 
Overall, the proposed shelf-life is considered supported by the data provided.  
Adventitious agents 
The materials of biological origin are obtained from a controlled safe source or treated appropriately to 
ensure absence of viral and non-viral adventitious agents. 
The  in-process  testing  system  documents  the  absence  of  contamination  throughout  the  active 
substance manufacturing process.  
The  viral  clearance  capacity  of  the  purification  process  has  been  validated  for  the  low-pH  step,  AEX 
chromatography  and  small-virus  retentive  filtration.  The  cumulative  effect  of  the  three  process  steps 
reduces the viral risk to a negligible level. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory 
consistency  and  uniformity  of  important  product  quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

One major objection on quality was raised during the procedure, relating to comparability between 
material used in the pivotal clinical trials (v0.4) and the commercial material (v1.0) and the related 
control of Manganese levels in the production bioreactor media.  
To assure that the commercial material is comparable to the clinical trial material the Applicant has 
included controls for Mn concentration in the cell culture media and also introduced ADCC potency as 
an active substance release test.  
The Applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and finished 
product and their manufacturing processes. A design space was initially claimed for the active 
substance. However, the Applicant has withdrawn their claim for a design space during the review. No 
design space was claimed for the finished product. 
Two recommendations have been agreed relating to the control of glycosylation.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends two points for investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical development program consisted of a battery of primary and safety pharmacology 
studies as well as pharmacokinetics (PK) and toxicology studies. These studies, except for the pilot 
toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys (see below), were conducted using IV administration and 
were consistent with International Conference of Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines. The cynomolgus 
monkey was considered the most appropriate model for assessing PK, pharmacodynamics (PD) and 
nonclinical safety in vivo since ocrelizumab is only known to bind to human and nonhuman primate 
CD20. No dedicated secondary and drug interaction pharmacology studies were performed. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Several  in  vitro  studies  were  conducted  to  characterize  the  binding  of  ocrelizumab  to  human  CD20, 
complement  C1q,  and  Fc  gamma  (Fcγ)  receptors,  and  the  antibody’s  ability  to  mediate  antibody-
dependent  cellular  phagocytosis 
(ADCC), 
complement-dependent  cytotoxicity  (CDC),  and  apoptosis.  According  to  the  Applicant,  ocrelizumab  is 
only known to bind to human and non-human primate CD20 but not rodent CD20, therefore, in vitro 
pharmacology  studies  were  performed  using  human  reagents  or  cell  lines,  and  utilized  a  known 
chimeric anti CD20 molecule, rituximab, as a reference because ocrelizumab and rituximab may share 
similar mechanisms of action, as well as may differ in activities.   
(ADCP),  antibody-dependent  cellular  cytotoxicity 
Nonclinical  in  vivo  pharmacology  investigations  of  B  cell  depletion  were  conducted  in  cynomolgus 
monkeys  in  which  the  effectiveness  of  ocrelizumab  in  depleting  B  cells  in  peripheral  blood  was 
Assessment report  
EMA/790835/2017 
     Page 25/180 
 
 
 
 
assessed  using  three  measures:  B  cell  counts  immediately  before  administration  of  the  second  dose, 
nadir B cell counts, and duration of total B cell depletion. In some studies, the degree of tissue B cell 
depletion from spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow was also measured.  
Binding potencies of Ocrelizumab for the high affinity Fcγ receptor, FcγRIa, and for the low affinity Fcγ 
receptors, FcγRIIa and FcγRIIb, were very similar to those of rituximab. Binding of Ocrelizumab to the 
low  affinity  Fcγ  receptor,  FcγRIIIa,  was  stronger  than  that  of  rituximab  for  both  allotypes  of  this 
receptor. Binding of Ocrelizumab to human complement C1q was very similar to that of rituximab with 
EC50 values of 0.72 ± 0.015 μg/mL (n = 3) and 0.62 ± 0.14 μg/mL (n = 3), respectively.  
Ocrelizumab  showed  strong  activity  in  NK  cell  mediated  antibody-dependent  cellular  cytotoxicity 
(ADCC). The potency of ocrelizumab was approximately four times that of rituximab based upon EC50 
values. Ocrelizumab also effectively promoted ADCC mediated by PBMCs.  
Both  ocrelizumab  and  rituximab  induced  apoptosis of  Ramos  cells  when  cross  linked  with  anti-human 
Fc. The apoptotic activity of ocrelizumab was slightly lower than that of rituximab. 
Finally, the ability of ocrelizumab to mediate CDC activity was demonstrated using human complement 
and  WIL2  S  cells  as  targets  where  ocrelizumab  was  approximately  3  to  4  fold  less  potent  than 
rituximab in promoting this activity.  
Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) was assessed by both microscopic imaging and two-
color  fluorescence  flow  cytometry.  In  each  experiment,  maximal  ADCP  with  ocrelizumab  was  at  least 
20%, whereas ADCP without antibody or with trastuzumab was always less than 10%. According to the 
study  report,  the  extent  of  phagocytosis  of  ocrelizumab-opsonized  target  cells  by  macrophages 
appeared to correlate with the concentrations of ocrelizumab in a dose-responsive manner. Thus, the 
results  of  the  study  suggest  that  ocrelizumab  induces  ADCP  of  CD20-expressing  target  cells  by 
monocyte-derived  macrophages.  A  two-week  (non-GLP)  in  vivo  study  was  performed  in  cynomolgus 
monkeys (n=4/group) to assess the pharmacodynamics properties of ocrelizumab (study 02-182-352). 
Two  animals  per  group  were  kept  for  an  8-week  recovery  period  before  euthanization.  Animals  were 
administered two intravenous (IV) bolus doses (0.05 or 10 mg/kg) of ocrelizumab 1 week apart (Day 1 
and  Day  8).  No  signs  of  test-article  related  toxicity  was  seen.  Partial  depletion  of  B-cells  at  the  low 
dose  (0.05  mg/kg  x  2)  and  full  depletion  at  the  high  dose  (10  mg/kg  x  2)  of  ocrelizumab  was 
demonstrated. There were no observed differences between vehicle control and ocrelizumab cohorts in 
absolute  T  cell  counts.  The  duration  of  full  depletion  for  total  B  cells  in  the  high  dose  groups  was  at 
least 9 days and less than 35 days. Total B cells returned to near baseline levels in recovery animals at 
the time of terminal necropsy. 
An  additional  PD  study  was  performed  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  to  further  assess  the  B-cell  depleting 
properties  of  ocrelizumab  (Study  03-0235-0349).  Animals  were  given  two  IV  bolus  doses  of 
ocrelizumab at 0.2, 0.5, or 2.0 mg/kg on Days 1 and 8 and thereafter all entered a 12-week recovery 
period. B cell numbers (measured by flow cytometry analysis) were depleted in animals one hour after 
receiving ocrelizumab on Day 1 at all three dose levels. B cell numbers partially recovered by Day 8 in 
the  low  dose  group,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  in  the  medium  dose  group.  The  high  dose  resulted  in  a 
nearly complete depletion of peripheral blood B cells from which the animals did not recoup as quickly. 
After the second dose of ocrelizumab, B cells decreased with increasing dose and were suppressed to a 
nadir value. A decrease in mean lymphocyte counts was observed after the Day 1 dose administration 
in all dose levels. This decrease in mean lymphocyte counts was less pronounced after the second dose 
administration  (Day  8)  and  recovered  to  near  baseline  for  the  two  lowest  dose  groups;  however, 
lymphocyte  counts  in  the  high  dose  group  remained  low  for  at  least  2  weeks  after  the  second  dose 
administration. T cell numbers were slightly increased following the administration of ocrelizumab, but 
cell numbers returned toward baseline values during the course of the study.  
The Applicant has also presented data regarding B-cell depletion and –repletion from toxicity studies in 
cynomolgus monkeys (Studies 02-182-0352, 03-0113-0349, 03-0114-0349, and 04-0192-0134).  
The  long-term  multiple-dose  study  (Study  04-0192-0134)  and  retreatment  study  (Study  03-0114-
0349) provided the most extensive follow-up data on duration of B-cell depletion and repletion because 
blood  samples  were  collected  from  animals  for  a  prolonged  period  (approximately  10.5  months  from 
Assessment report  
EMA/790835/2017 
     Page 26/180 
 
 
 
 
first dose to recovery necropsy). The duration of peripheral depletion was approximately 3 months at 
the 50 and 100 mg/kg (x 2) dose levels (Study 03-0114-0349).  
After  retreatment  at  100  mg/kg  x  2,  the  duration  of  peripheral  depletion  was  again  approximately  3 
months even though mean B-cell counts were only approximately 35% of baseline values at the time 
of retreatment. B-cell depletion in lymphatic organs was high but not complete. Depletion in the spleen 
and  lymph  nodes  was  dose  dependent;  no  dose  correlation  was  observed  in  bone  marrow.  Depletion 
was also lower in bone marrow (B-cell counts reduced by approximately 2-fold in treated vs. control) 
when compared with depletion in the spleen and the lymph nodes (B-cell counts reduced by as much 
as 5- and 30-fold, respectively). 
A GLP safety, PK, and PD study in cynomolgus monkeys was conducted in which the PD profile of the 
v0.2 material was evaluated and compared with that of the v0.1 material. The v0.1 and v0.2 materials 
both depleted blood B cells effectively and showed similar PD profiles in cynomolgus monkeys (Study 
07-0171).  
The non-clinical studies presented by the Applicant to demonstrate the pharmacodynamic properties of 
ocrelizumab  support  its  mode  of  action  as  a  reversible  B-cell  depleting  molecule.  In  vitro  and  in  vivo 
comparability studies indicate similar activity and potency for the two batches  of early clinical process 
material  (Study  06-1069).  In  the  Quality  section  of  the  dossier,  further  comparability  data  are 
presented  that  show  a  difference  in  potency  between  early  clinical,  pivotal  clinical  and  commercial 
materials.  The  material  used  within  the  nonclinical  studies  was,  if  anything,  more  potent  than  the 
material used in pivotal studies. Although the material used in nonclinical studies may not adequately 
provide  toxicology  coverage  of  the  commercial  material,  any  concern  can  be  mitigated  since  the 
material represents a worst-case with respect to safety outcomes. 
To  provide  further  reassurance  that  the  intent-for-market  batches  and  previous  ocrelizumab  batches 
used  for  non-clinical  and  clinical  studies  are  indeed  comparable,  and  that  quality  differences  do  not 
give  rise  to  e.g.  differences  in  efficacy  and  safety  end  points  in  the  clinical  setting,  the  Applicant 
commits  to  provide  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  and  pharmacodynamic  (PD)  (blood  B-cell  depletion)  clinical 
data from the commercial material as a post-marketing commitment.   
No secondary pharmacodynamic or pharmacodynamics drug interaction studies have been conducted. 
No  stand-alone  safety  pharmacology  studies  were  performed.  Safety  pharmacology  endpoints  were 
included in repeat dose studies in monkey. This approach is endorsed. Respiratory and cardiovascular 
measurements  were  performed  in  two  studies  where  the  animals  were  non-sedated  and  two  studies 
where the animals were lightly sedated with ketamine. CNS observational battery was included in one 
study,  males  only.  No  treatment  related  observations  in  either  respiratory,  cardiovascular  or  CNS 
observations were noted following doses of up to 100 mg/kg ocrelizumab.

observations were noted following doses of up to 100 mg/kg ocrelizumab. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  ocrelizumab  were  investigated  in  mice  (including  wild  type  and  huCD20 
transgenic mice), rats, and cynomolgus monkeys. The pharmacokinetics of ocrelizumab were evaluated 
in several single- and multiple dose studies at various dose levels. Several assays to detect antibodies 
to ocrelizumab were used in the non-clinical PK studies and the Applicant presents a table for overview 
of which studies the methods were used. This is considered appropriate. 
Assessment report

Study Report 4.2H7.2.AVR_1 was validated to quantify both mouse and rat ocrelizumab serum levels.  
PK parameters in wild-type mice and wild-type rats given a single IV bolus dose of ocrelizumab across 
a  100-fold  range  of  doses  (0.5,  5,  and  50  mg/kg)  lacked  dose  dependence,  as  expected  for  a  non-
binding  species  (Studies  03-0155-0349  and  03-0157-0349).  Further  studies  were  performed  in 
cynomolgus monkeys as this species was considered the most appropriate.  
In  cynomolgus  monkeys,  ocrelizumab  CL  and  T½  were  dose  dependent  and  non-linear.  As  the  dose 
increased,  CL  decreased  and  T½  increased.  Ocrelizumab  had  a  long  terminal  T½    following  a  rapid 
initial distribution phase and, which could indicate that binding to circulating and tissue-resident B cells 
reduces levels of free ocrelizumab, CL was partly dependent on CD20 antigen-bearing B cells (Studies 
02-0182-0352,  03-0235-0349,  03-0113-0349,  03-0684-0134,  04-0192-0134).  No  gender  differences 
were observed in PK parameters. 
At  lower  dose  levels  (0.2-10  mg/kg)  given  intravenously,  ocrelizumab  exhibited  nonlinear  CL  in 
cynomolgus  monkeys.  In  general,  as  the  dose  or  dosing  frequency  or  both  were  increased  in 
cynomolgus  monkeys,  CL  decreased  (from  154  mL/day/kg  at  0.2  mg/kg  to  10.3  mL/day/kg  at  10 
mg/kg).  Accordingly,  T½  increased  from  1  to  7  days  when  the  dose  was  increased  from  0.2  to  10 
mg/kg (Studies 02-0182-0352 and 03-0235-0349).  
At higher doses (above 10 mg/kg) in the cynomolgus monkey, ocrelizumab exhibited mostly linear CL 
(Studies  03-0113-0349,  03-0114-0349,  and  03-0684-0134).  Typically,  a  fast  distribution  phase 
followed  by  a  prolonged  elimination  phase  was  observed.  However,  increased  dosing  frequency  also 
resulted in decreased CL and increased T½. 
Toxicokinetics were also assessed in reproductive toxicology studies (Study 04-1272-1342). Similar to 
non-pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, maximum serum concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve 
(AUC)  for  ocrelizumab  increased  in  an  approximately  dose-proportional  manner.  Ocrelizumab  serum 
concentrations  were  generally  higher  in  maternal  serum  compared  with  fetal  serum  at  the  time  of 
cesarean  section;  the  fetal-to-maternal  serum  concentration  ratio  of  ocrelizumab  was  variable  and 
ranged from 0.495 to 4.47 (90%, or 17/19, of the fetus-dam pairs had maternal concentrations higher 
than those of the fetus). Low amniotic fluid concentrations were detected in 11 of 12 animals.  
In  a  perinatal  and  postnatal  developmental  toxicity  study,  ocrelizumab  was  administered  weekly  to 
pregnant  cynomolgus  monkeys  from  the  beginning  of  organogenesis  through  approximately  1  month 
after  natural  delivery.  Exposure  (Cmax  and  AUC)  to  ocrelizumab  increased  generally  dose 
proportionally. Neonate to maternal concentration ratios ranged from 0.0205 to 0.848 at the 20 mg/kg 
dose  level  and  from  0.0283  to  0.411  at  the  100  mg/kg  dose  level.  Measurable  levels  of  ocrelizumab 
were detected in milk during the lactation period in most of the animals (Study 06-1260).  
Anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) to ocrelizumab were detected in most studies in cynomolgus monkeys and 
were  discussed  by  the  Applicant.  The  presence  of  ADAs  to  ocrelizumab  did  impact  exposure  in  some 
low-dose  animals  but there  was  only  minimal impact  in ocrelizumab  exposure  in  animals given  doses 
above  10  mg/kg.  It  is  acknowledged  that  the  induction  of  antibody  formation  in  animals  is  not 
predictive of a potential for antibody formation in humans, in compliance with ICH S6 (R1) guideline.  
PK  parameters  for  the  two  different  clones  were  found  to  be  similar  in  a  cynomolgus  monkey  study 
testing two doses of i.v. ocrelizumab 50 mg/kg (given 2 weeks apart). No additional studies comparing 
subsequent  versions  (production  batches)  could  be  identified  and  as  such,  the  data  from  PK  studies 
presented in the non-clinical dossier can only be considered supportive for assessment of the PK profile 
of ocrelizumab subsequent versions.  
Tissue  distribution  studies  in  mice  engineered  to  express  huCD20  (huCD20  transgenic  mice) 
demonstrated  that,  while  ocrelizumab  does  not  recognize  CD20  in  wild-type  mice,  there  was  clear 
binding  of  ocrelizumab  with  B  cells  in  huCD20  transgenic  mice.  Moreover,  huCD20  transgenic  mice 
cleared ocrelizumab significantly faster and in a dose-dependent manner than wild-type mice. 
Tissue distribution studies by positron emission tomography imaging in cynomolgus monkeys indicated 
the presence of the labelled antibody within blood pool and distribution to organs having high levels of 
Assessment report  
EMA/790835/2017 
     Page 28/180 
 
 
 
 
B cells (e.g., spleen and lymphoid tissues). These data support the assertion that CD20 expression on 
B cells is involved in the in vivo distribution and clearance of ocrelizumab (Study 15-0538).  
A  dosimetry  study  was  also  performed  in  nonhuman  primates  to  determine  radiation  absorbed  dose 
estimates to critical organs. Using whole-body imaging in cynomolgus monkeys, radiation exposure of 
[111In]ocrelizumab to human subjects was estimated. The uptake and bio-distribution was consistent 
with  other  radiolabeled  anti-CD20  therapies.  As  a  measure  of  radiation  exposure  to  the  entire  body, 
the effective dose of [111In]ocrelizumab was 0.16 mSv/MBq (Study 14-3756). 
The  expected  products  of  the  metabolism  derived  proteins  and  peptides,  including  IgG1  monoclonal 
antibodies  such  as  ocrelizumab,  are  small  peptides  and  individual  amino  acids.  Free  circulating 
ocrelizumab enters the metabolic pathway of endogenous soluble IgG, whereas ocrelizumab bound to 
CD20+ lymphocytes can be phagocytosed together with destroyed B cells by infiltrating macrophages 
and granulocytes. Therefore, in accordance with ICH S6, no formal metabolism studies were performed 
and this is acceptable. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
In  the  toxicology  program  a  variety  of  dosing  regimens  were  evaluated  in  cynomolgus  monkeys, 
including weekly x 2, Q2W x 2, Q2W x 2 for two cycles [cycle x Q2W x 2], weekly x 4, and Q3W x 8. 
No  single  dose  toxicity  studies  were  performed.  This  is  acceptable.  In  each  repeat-dose  study,  all 
available  animals  were  evaluated  for  clinical  signs  and  changes  in  food  consumption,  body  weight, 
physiological  indices  (heart  rate,  blood  pressure,  respiration  rate,  body  temperature),  ECG’s,  physical 
and ophthalmic examinations, clinical pathology, hematology, urinalysis, organ weight, and gross and 
histologic pathology. Additionally, peripheral blood and lymphoid tissue B cells were evaluated by flow 
cytometry and lymphoid tissue B cells were evaluated by IHC in the GLP studies. 
In the repeat dose toxicity studies, labelled anti CD20 reagents could not be used to identify CD20+ B 
cells in these studies as the target is masked by drug, therefore anti CD40 was used to identify B cells 
in cynomolgus monkeys (Vugmeyster et al. 2003). 
In all studies, ocrelizumab was well tolerated. A dose dependent CD40+ B-cell depletion was observed. 
Overall, ocrelizumab was well tolerated with no adverse findings identified. Drug related findings were 
restricted to pharmacologically mediated reductions in B cells and secondary findings related to B cell 
depletion,  including  reduction  in  size  and/or  numbers  of  lymphoid  germinal  centres  in  spleen  and 
lymph  nodes.  Following  recovery  periods  B-cell  repletion  was  observed  to  some  degree,  more  so  in 
groups treated with 50 mg/kg or less, but following 100 mg/kg ocrelizumab, B-cell repletion was also 
observed following recovery phase of sufficient degree.  
In  study  report  Study  04  0192  0134,  slight  to  mild  reductions  in  circulating  red  blood  cell  mass  was 
observed in  both  treated groups.  This  was  considered  related  to ocrelizumab  treatment  in this  study. 
However in most other repeat dose studies performed, some degree of fluctuations were observed in 
red blood cell parameters, and considered not related to treatment, but rather related to the frequent 
blood sampling procedures. Indeed one female in the present study, which showed low red blood cell 
count  (2.65  and  2.69  106  µL  on  Days  147  and  149  respectively,  compared  to  the  pre-dose  count  of 
5.15  106  µL  for  the  same  animal)  also  presented  with  bruising  on  the  femoral  area  (but  so  did  a 
number of other animals with higher blood cell counts as well). The observed reductions in red blood 
cell parameters in this study is considered related to the procedure of blood sampling in this study as 
well as in the remaining studies. The observed reductions are not higher or more severe in this study 
than in the remaining toxicology studies. 
In  the  study  03-0114-0349,  following  Cycle  1  (Q2W),  peripheral  blood  B  cells  (CD3+CD40+)  were 
rapidly  reduced  to  undetectable  levels  for  all  treated  groups,  with  repopulation  beginning  at  Week  6 
(10 mg/kg) and Week 14 (50 and 100 mg/kg). Following the second cycle administered 14 weeks after 
the first cycle (50 and 100 mg/kg cohorts, only) there was near complete B cell repletion by Week 43. 
The rate of B cell repletion was similar for cohorts receiving either one or two cycles (evaluated at 100 
mg/kg  only).  Diffuse  lymphocytic  and  plasmacytic  cell  infiltrates  were  observed  in  the  choroid  and 
ciliary body of the eyes in two mid dose females and one male and one female at high dose level. No 
Assessment report

related finding were observed in other toxicity studies, but in the tissue cross reactivity study, diffuse 
staining of lens protein was observed in one of the cynomolgus tissue slides, and in two of the human 
tissue slides.  However, the choroid and ciliary body and lens are distinct anatomical structures that do 
not share any communication within the eye.  As such, there is no linkage between the observation of 
inflammation in the choroid and ciliary body of four cynomolgus monkeys in Study 03-0114-0349 and 
the  lens  protein  reactivity  noted in  one  cynomolgus  and  two  human  eye  frozen  tissue  sections  in  the 
Tissue Cross-Reactivity (TCR) study (Study 03-0216-0349).  
In  study  07-0171,  two  batches  of  ocrelizumab,  produced  by  two  different  processes  was  compared.  
None  of  the  two  clones  used  for  producing  ocrelizumab  compared  in  this  study,  are  the  intent  to 
marked formulation. To support the process change from v0.1 to v0.2 a nonclinical in vivo study was 
performed,  however,  the  proposed  commercial  supply  is  from  v1.0,  and  no  nonclinical  studies  have 
been  described in  the  nonclinical  parts  of  the dossier  to  support  the transition  from  the  experimental 
drug substance processes to the final drug substance to be marketed.  
The lack of genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies is in line with the relevant guidance document (ICH 
S6). 
Reproductive toxicity studies 
In all the reproductive studies, loading doses were utilized at the start of dosing. The dose level of 20 
mg/kg  has  not  been  used  in  the  remaining  repeat  dose  studies,  where  10,  and  50  were  most  often 
used,  in  addition  to  the  high  dose  level  of  100  mg/kg  which  is  also  the  high  dose  level  in  the 
reproductive  studies.  In  these  studies,  as  well  as  in  the  repeat  dose  studies  performed,  the  general 
findings  of  B-cell  depletion,  both  in  peripheral  blood  circulation  as  well  as  in  lymphoid  follicles  of  the 
spleen and lymph nodes is expected findings linked to the pharmacology. 
For  the  reproductive  study  (04-1272-1342)  the  Applicant  describes  safety  margins  of  14.6  and  72.9 
based on accumulated dose administered to the animals, for low and high dose respectively.   
In  the  two  fertility  studies,  ocrelizumab  treatment  at  15/20  or  75/100  mg/kg  did  not  cause  any 
observable  changes  to  fertility  parameters  or  the  reproductive  organs  in  males  or  females.  In  both 
studies, depletion of CD40+ B-cells was observed, as well as microscopically observable hypocellularity 
of lymphoid follicles in spleen and lymph nodes of the treated animals.  
In the study of female fertility, one animal in the 15/20 mg/kg/dose presented with clinical signs from 
Day  164,  which  upon  necropsy  was  correlated  to  the  finding  of  a  nasal  carcinoma.  The  same  animal 
had shown body weight loss during the treatment cycles and lack of menstrual bleeding at the end of 
treatment  cycle  3.  According  to  the  Applicant,  the  present  finding  should  be  regarded  as  incidental, 
due  to  the  absence  of  abnormal  proliferative  findings  in  any  other  animals.  The  present  statement 
leads  therefore  to  the  suggestion  that  such  an  effect  could  be  observed  also  in  control  (or  naïve) 
animals.  However,  as  seen  in  the  literature,  only  three  cases  of  spontaneous  tumours  of  the  nasal 
cavity have been found in monkeys [for references see Experimental tumours in monkeys, by Dzhemal 
Sh.  Beniashvili,  1994].  Moreover,  more  recent  data  [J.  Kaspareit,  et  al.  “Spontaneous  neoplasms 
observed  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  (Macaca  fascicularis)  during  a  15-year  period”,  Experimental  and 
Toxicologic Pathology Volume 59, Issues 3–4, 26 November 2007, Pages 163–169] described only one 
nasal cavity adenoma. 
The occurrence of nasal cavity carcinoma is hence of concern, in light also of clinical data, reporting a 
higher incidence rate of malignancies in ocrelizumab-treated patients when compared to IFN or placebo 
groups  (Module  2.7.4,  Summary  of  Clinical  Safety).  A  review  of  historical  data  from  an  estimate  of 
more  than  20,000  animals  over  a  24  year  period  form  the  CRO,  showed  only  50  benign  and  14 
malignant  tumours  had  been  found.  The  only  nasal  adenocarcinoma  identified  was  from  the  present 
study.  Overall,  it  is  difficult  to  draw  any  firm  conclusion  on  both  the  incidence  and  nature  of  all 
neoplasms occurring in cynomolgus monkeys over the period 1992-2016. Nevertheless, the neoplasm 
occurring  in  just  one  ocrelizumab-treated  animal,  leads  to  the  suggestion  that  a  relationship  to  drug 
administration is unlikely, given also that this was the only identified nasal neoplasm.

In the embryofetal toxicity study, only expected pharmacology findings consistent with what has been 
seen  in  the  other  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies,  including  fertility  studies  was  observed.  No  adverse 
toxicity was observed in the pregnant dams nor any signs of teratogenicity or embryotoxicity. 
In  the  maternal  animals,  persistent  B-cell  depletion  in  peripheral  blood  was  observed.  Three  animals 
were euthanized moribund, one in each group, including the control group. The cause of moribundity 
was  not  established,  and  relation  to  treatment  with  ocrelizumab  was  not  ascertained.  The  female 
treated  with  15/20  mg/kg/dose  ocrelizumab  showed  renal  cortical  necrosis.  Prior  to  the  third  weekly 
dose, this animal showed a marked ADA response, and the cause of this animal’s moribundity may be 
due  to  an  adverse  immune  response  to  ocrelizumab  treatment.  The  adverse immune  response  in the 
monkey  is  not  necessarily  an  indication  of  risk  of  human  immune  response  following  treatment  with 
ocrelizumab.  
Two neonates in the high dose group (75/100 mg/kg/dose) were found dead or euthanized moribund 
on  DB  6  and  138  respectively.  The  cause  of  death  or  moribundity  of  these  two  neonates  was  in  part 
attributed  to  an  opportunistic  infection  in  one  animal;  weakness  due  to  premature  delivery,  and 
immaturity may have been a predisposing factor. The second animal became moribund while nursing 
from  a  dam  diagnosed  with  concurrent  staphylococcal  mastitis.  Both  the  maternal  mastitis  and  the 
neonatal  infections  could  have  potentially  been  impacted  by  B  cell  depletion  related  to  systemic 
exposure to ocrelizumab. 
In  the  peri-  and  post-natal  study,  testicular  weights  (absolute  and  relative  to  brain  weight)  of  the 
neonates were significantly decreased in the high dose group as compared to study control neonates.  
Although a relationship to ocrelizumab administration cannot be excluded, given the lack of differences 
in  weights  of  the  accessory  reproductive  organs  (epididymis,  prostate/  seminal  vesicle  weights),  the 
small  sample  size  and  the  age  of  neonates  in  this  study,  toxicological  significance  of  the  testicular 
weight decrease on testis maturity remains unclear. 
Other  ocrelizumab-related  microscopic  changes  observed  in  the  neonates  included  glomerulopathy, 
lymphoplasmacytic  inflammation  in  the  kidney,  and  lymphoid  follicle  formation  in  the  sternal  bone 
marrow.  Minimal  to  mild  glomerulopathy  was  noted  in  4  of  11  neonates  in  the  75/100  mg/kg  group 
and  3  of  13  animals  in  the  15/20  mg/kg  group.  This  comprised  a  spectrum  of  glomerular  changes 
ranging  from  small  immature  (fetal)  glomeruli  with  concentric  fibrosis  of  the  Bowman’s  capsule 
(crescent  formation)  to  severely  contracted  sclerotic  glomeruli.  Mild  lymphoplasmacytic  inflammation 
of  the  kidneys  was  observed  in  2  of  11  animals  in  the  75/100  mg/kg  group.  The  extent  of 
lymphoplasmacytic  infiltrates  was  greater  than  concurrent  control  animals,  and  the  infiltrating  cells 
were present in nodular aggregates in the interstitium resembling lymphoid follicles. Lymphoid follicle 
formation was noted in the sternal bone marrow in 5 of 11 animals in the 75/100 mg/kg group, 4 of 13 
animals in the 15/20 mg/kg group, and 0 of 13 control animals. 
A  juvenile  toxicity  study  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  is  planned.  In  the  PIP  agreed  upon  with  EMA  no 
nonclinical  studies  are  mentioned.  However  the  study  is  a  requirement  from  authorities  in  different 
regions, and when the study is completed it should be submitted to the EMA as well. 
However,  if  the  study  has  been  started,  and/or  the  performance  of  the  study  is  sufficiently  justified, 
the study report should be submitted for assessment upon completion. 
Local tolerance 
Ocrelizumab  local  tolerance  following  IV  administration  was  assessed  in  a  study  where  a  SC 
formulation was tested, as well as in the repeat dose studies. The IV administration of ocrelizumab did 
not  give  rise  to  any  test  article  related  changes,  unlike  the  SC  administrations.  The  local  tolerance 
changes observed following SC administration, led to the discontinuation of the SC formulation, hence 
the study is not discussed in further detail here. 
No  dedicated  studies  on  antigenicity,  immunotoxicity,  dependence,  metabolites  or  impurities  were 
performed. Immunotoxicity was assessed as part of the repeat dose studies as well as the reproductive 
toxicity studies.

Ocrelizumab at concentrations of 1.0, 5.0, or 10 mg/mL did not cause hemolysis when mixed with an 
equal volume of human or cynomolgus monkey whole blood, or precipitation or coagulation in human 
or monkey serum or plasma at equal volume. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Applicant has provided a justification for not performing a formal ERA. As the drug substance is a 
monoclonal antibody, this is in line with the current relevant guideline (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) 
and Q&A document (EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 Rev. 1). In spite of this, the Applicant has 
performed two acute toxicity studies in aquatic compartment (Manometric Respirometry Test and 
Acute Ecotoxicity Limit Tests), which showed that the maximal tested concentration was tolerated by 
the test systems. Furthermore, ocrelizumab was biodegradable. 
Ocrelizumab is a monoclonal antibody, the use of which will not alter the concentration or distribution 
of the substance in the environment. Therefore, ocrelizumab is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment and no further studies are considered necessary. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The  non-clinical  testing  strategy  is  consistent  with  ICH  S6(R2)  guideline.  A  number  of  in  vitro  and  in 
vivo studies were presented in this non-clinical dossier that do indeed support the mode of action for 
ocrelizumab  as  a  reversible  B-cell  depleting  antibody.  The  cynomolgus  monkey  was  found  to  be  the 
most  relevant  species  for  in  vivo  studies,  and  although  anti-drug-antibodies  (ADAs)  were  detected 
primarily in studies using low doses, this finding is common in studies using monoclonal antibodies and 
the  clinical  relevance  is  considered  uncertain.  Toxicity  findings  could  be  ascribed  mostly  to  the 
pharmacology of the drug, i.e. B-cell depletion in peripheral blood and lymphoid organs etc, although 
one concern regarding the finding of an adenoma in the nasal cavity of one female monkey should be 
further addressed by the Applicant to rule out clinical relevance.  
The non-clinical studies presented by the Applicant to demonstrate the pharmacodynamic properties of 
ocrelizumab  support  its  mode  of  action  as  a  reversible  B-cell  depleting  molecule.  In  vitro  and  in  vivo 
comparability studies indicate similar activity and potency for the two batches of early clinical process 
materials,  (Study  06-1069).  In  the  Quality  section  of  the  dossier,  further  comparability  data  are 
presented  that  show  a  difference  in  potency  between  early  clinical,  pivotal  clinical  and  commercial 
process materials. The material used within the nonclinical studies was, if anything, more potent than 
the  material  used  in  pivotal  studies.  Although  the  material  used  in  nonclinical  studies  may  not 
adequately  provide  toxicology  coverage  of  the  commercial  material,  any  concern  can  be  mitigated 
since the material represents a worst-case with respect to safety outcomes. 
To  provide  further  reassurance  that  the  intent-for-market  batches  and  previous  ocrelizumab  batches 
used  for  non-clinical  and  clinical  studies  are  indeed  comparable,  and  that  quality  differences  do  not 
give  rise  to  e.g.  differences  in  efficacy  and  safety  end  points  in  the  clinical  setting,  the  Applicant 
commits  to  provide  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  and  pharmacodynamic  (PD)  (blood  B-cell  depletion)  clinical 
data from the commercial process material as a post-marketing commitment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In  vitro  pharmacology  studies  provided  adequate  evidence  that  upon  binding  to  CD20  expressed  on 
mature  B  cells,  ocrelizumab  could  mediate  B-cell  lysis  through  one  or  more  of  the  following 
mechanisms: ADCP, ADCC, CDC, and apoptosis. In vivo studies demonstrated a dose-dependent initial 
rapid depletion of circulating B cells followed by full repletion. 
From a pharmacokinetic point of view, the cynomolgus monkey was the most relevant species for non-
clinical efficacy and safety studies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/790835/2017 
     Page 32/180 
 
 
 
 
The  toxicology  program  revealed  that  B-cell  depletion  was  the  most  prominent  effect  exerted  by 
ocrelizumab.  It  moreover  provides  evidence  of  safety,  to  support  treatment  of  the  proposed  clinical 
population with ocrelizumab. Adequate information has been included in the SmPC. 
Based  on  the  non-clinical  data  presented  by  the  Applicant  regarding  pharmacodynamics, 
pharmacokinetic and toxicology, the application could be approvable.  
From a non-clinical perspective the CHMP considered the following measures necessary: 
• 
• 
In  order  to provide  further  reassurance  on  the  comparability of  the intent-for-market  batches 
and  previous  ocrelizumab  batches  used  for  non-clinical  and  clinical  studies,  the  Applicant 
should  provide  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  and  pharmacodynamic  (PD)  (blood  B-cell  depletion) 
clinical data from the commercial process material as a post-marketing commitment.  
It  is  recommended  that  the  study  report  from  the  planned  juvenile  toxicity  study  in 
cynomolgus monkeys be submitted to EMA upon completion.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  clinical  studies  contributing  with  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  data  in  the  MS  population  are  presented 
above.  One-thousand-four-hundred-twenty-three  (1,423)  MS  patients  treated  with  ocrelizumab  and 
with  PK  data  were  included  in  the  studies.  Population  PK  (pop-PK)  analyses  and  exposure-response 
analyses were submitted in support of the PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) dossier. 
Assessment report  
EMA/790835/2017 
     Page 36/180 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In  addition,  supportive  data  from  seven  studies  (Studies  ACT2847g,  JA21963,  WA18230,  WA20494, 
WA20495, WA20946, WA20947) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was also submitted. 
Analytical methods and pharmacokinetic data analysis 
A validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to quantify ocrelizumab 
concentrations in serum samples from patients.   
Anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) to ocrelizumab in human serum were detected using two validated 
bridging assay methods. Using affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies directed against ocrelizumab, the 
relative sensitivity was determined to be ≤7 ng/mL for MS serum (in the absence of ocrelizumab) and 
in the presence of 20 μg/mL of ocrelizumab, the assay was able to detect 500 ng/mL of the affinity 
purified antibodies. The two ADA methods showed comparable desired relative sensitivities.  
Overall, the analytical methods are adequately validated and are suitable for the purpose.  
The final PK model was a 2-compartment model with time-variant clearance. The PK population 
included all patients in the ocrelizumab group who had at least one measurable concentration value. 
Ocrelizumab serum concentration-time data were described using non-linear mixed effect analysis to 
obtain the following pop-PK parameters: 
•  Clearances with associated inter-individual variability. 
•  Volumes of distributions with associated inter-individual variability. 
• 
Influence of covariates on above pop-PK parameters. 
•  Derived exposure measures: cumulative AUC, Cmax and Cmin. 
Bioequivalence  
During the clinical development program, 4 development versions of ocrelizumab were used. A single 
development process version has been use in the pivotal MS studies WA21092, WA21093, WA25046, 
whereas in study WA21493, multiple development process versions were used. A fifth process 
versionis intended for commercial use but has not been used in any of the pivotal studies. It is 
currently used in the open-label extension studies, but no clinical data from this study have been 
submitted.  
Bioequivalence studies between any of the product versions have not been performed but analytical 
comparability has been performed between the development process versions and the commercial 
process version. The comparability approach is evaluated in the Quality assessment report.  
Between the development process used for the manufacture of the pivotal trial material and the 
commercial process proposed for the manufacture of commercial material, process changes were made 
and an extensive comparability assessment in accordance with ICH Q5E was applied. The main 
difference between the versions relates to the glycosylation. In vitro studies have demonstrated that 
upon binding to CD20 expressed on mature B cells, ocrelizumab selectively depletes B cells through 
several potential mechanisms, including antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), antibody-
dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), CDC, and induction of apoptosis. These mechanisms are 
influenced by the glycosylation profile of the molecule.

EMA/790835/2017 
     Page 37/180 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The observed differences (between pivotal clinical and commercial versions) are not expected to 
impact the PK of ocrelizumab but it potentially affects the PD.The activity/potency is lower in the 
commercial process version compared to the development process versions; this can at least 
theoretical impact efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab. To further elucidate this issue, a clarification 
meeting was held in November 2016. At this meeting, the Agencies stated that if full and robust 
analytical and biological comparability for the 2016 material was demonstrated, additional clinical data 
may not be required. The Applicant informed that the proposed marketing material would be aligned 
with material used in the pivotal trials. Further, the Applicant committed to provide PK and PD (blood 
B-cell depletion) data for the 2014 commercial process material as a post-marketing commitment if 
required.  At the response on Day 180, the Applicant informs that at the quality level several actions 
have been taken to assure that the commercial process ocrelizumab material is of the same quality as 
used in the pivotal clinical trial.  Manganese level in the production culture contributed to the 
differences observed in glycosylation profile, and the manganese level in the cell culture medium will 
now be controlled to ensure product quality consistent with pivotal clinical material.In additionthe 
Applicant has two measures of potency testing (CDC and ADCC), as well as the correlated glycan 
attributes (G0 and G0-F) onthe drug substance control system. All test limits are aligned with the 
clinical experience of pivotal clinical drug substance. Due to these findings of comparability between 
the two manufacturing processes, the Applicant does not consider that it is necessary to present 
clinical data. This is agreed and therefore clinical PK and PD data will not be requested. 
Absorption, distribution and elimination 
As ocrelizumab is administered intravenously, bioavailability is 100%.  
Data  regarding  distribution  in  RMS  patients  derive  from  the  pop-PK  analysis  of  Studies  WA21492, 
WA21093  and  Study  WA21493.  The  concentration-time  course  of  ocrelizumab  was  accurately 
described  by  a  two-compartment  PK  model  and  with  steady-state  PK  parameters  typical  for  an  IgG1 
mAb.  For  a  reference  patient  (female,  weighing  75 kg,  with  a  baseline  B-cell count  of  0.225  x109/L), 
ocrelizumab central volume was estimated to be 2.78 L (95% CI: 2.71–2.85 L). Peripheral volume was 
2.68  L  (95%CI:  2.53–2.82  L)  and  probably  mostly  represents  the  lymphatic  liquid.  The  inter-
compartment clearance was 0.294 L/day (95%CI: 0.251–0.337 L/day). Plasma protein binding studies 
have  not  been  performed.  The  conditional  predictions  of  concentration  and  AUC  for  ocrelizumab  600 
mg (administrated as two IV infusions of 300 mg given 14 days apart on Day 1 and Day 15, followed 
by single IV infusions of 600 mg every 6 months/every 24 week) is presented in Table 2.

Table  2:  RMS  (WA21493,  WA21092,  WA21093)  -  Conditional  Predictions  of  PK 
Parameters for 600 mg Ocrelizumab 
Data  from  PPMS  patients  derive  from  study  WA25046.  Exposure  metrics  are  comparable  to  the  RMS 
data,  besides  the  lower  Cmax  as  2x300  mg  IV  infusions  were  given  every  24  weeks  throughout  the 
PPMS study, while RMS patients received 600 mg IV infusions (after the first dose which was given as 
2 infusions of 300 mg on Days 1 and 15 in all RMS and PPMS studies).  
No  classic  biotransformation  studies  were  conducted  in  vitro  or  in  vivo.  The  expected  metabolic 
products  of  proteins  and  peptides,  including  IgG1  mAbs  such  as  ocrelizumab,  are  small  peptides  and 
amino  acids.  For  a  reference  patient  (female,  weighing  75  kg,  with  a  baseline  B-cell  count  of  0.225 
x109/L),  ocrelizumab  constant  clearance  (CLinf)  was  estimated  at  0.17  L/day  (95%CI:  0.166–0.174 
L/day)  and  the  terminal  half-life  (T½)  of  ocrelizumab  was  26  days.  There  is  no  information  available 
regarding excretion of ocrelizumab but as a mAb, excretion of intact ocrelizumab is not expected.

Dose proportionality and Time dependency 
Dose  proportionality  was  investigated  in  the  early  RA  studies.  Higher  clearance  was  observed  at  the 
low dose levels of 20 mg and 100 mg, whereas linear PK was approached at dose levels above 400 mg 
(Table 3, and Figure 1). 
Table 3: ACT2847g - Ocrelizumab PK Parameters 
Figure 1 ACT2847g: Ocrelizumab Concentration versus Time 
Dose  proportionality  and  time  dependency  in  MS  patients  was  investigated  in  Study  WA21493. 
Ocrelizumab  generally  demonstrates  a  biphasic  disposition,  with  a  rapid  initial  decline  in  serum 
concentration followed by a more prolonged terminal disposition phase (Figure 2).   
The  pop-PK  analysis  of  the  pooled  RMS  studies  WA21493,  WA21092  and  WA21093  showed  a  time-
dependent  clearance  (Figure  2)  most  likely  attributable  to  target-mediated  drug  disposition  via 
depletion of B-cells, the target for ocrelizumab binding (and elimination).

Inter- and intra-individual variability 
Inter-individual variability was calculated in the population-PK analysis. Overall, inter-patient variability 
in PK parameters in MS patients was moderate up to 30% (coefficient of variation).  
There  is  no  data  regarding  intra-individual  variability.  This  is  adequately  justified  by  the  final  PK-PD 
model, which showed an  excellent fit though it did not include the inter-occation variability indicating 
that including only the residual variability was sufficient.  
Interactions 
As  ocrelizumab  is  a  monoclonal  antibody,  no  drug-drug  interactions  are  expected  via the  CYPs,  other 
metabolising  enzymes,  or  transporters.  Therefore,  no  formal  drug-drug  interaction  studies  have  been 
performed in vitro or in vivo.  
There  is  no  information  regarding  potential  PD  interaction  with  other  immunomodulatory  multiple 
sclerosis  (MS)  therapies;  especially  the  safety  of  ocrelizumab  following  or  concomitant  with  other 
immunosuppressive/ immunomodulating disease modifying therapies (DMTs) is unclear.  
Pharmacokinetics in target population and in special populations 
All pivotal PK studies have been performed in the target population (patients with MS); therefore, the 
results are considered representative for the target population. 
In  the  pop-PK  analyses of  Studies  WA21493,  W21092  and  WA21093, different  covariate  factors  were 
investigated for the influence of the disposition of ocrelizumab.  
No  effect  of  neither  creatinine  clearance  (CRCL)  or  the  hepatic  enzymes  ALT,  AST  or  bilirubin  was 
observed but only one patient with CRCL (≤50 and  >30 mL/min) was included and few patients with 
increased hepatic enzymes/bilirubin were included.  
B-cell counts at baseline as well as gender were included in the final covariate model (Table 10), but 
the influence was small and without clinical relevance.  
As  typical  for  mAbs,  ocrelizumab  clearances  and  volumes  of  distribution  increased  with  body  weight 
but terminal and effective half-lives were unaffected by body weight (Table 4).

Table  4:  Summary  of  Conditional  Predictions  for  CL inf  ,  V 1,  Vss,  t½  term  and  t  ½  eff, 
Overall and by Body Weight Categories 
In  RMS  patients  with  low  weight  (48.5  kg),  CLinf  and  V1  were  respectively  26%  and  16%  lower 
compared  to  patients  weighing  75  kg.  In  patients  with  high  weight  (116  kg),  CLinf  and  V1  were 
respectively 35% and 19% higher compared to patients weighing 75 kg.  
Cmax values were estimated to be 19% higher for RMS patients weighing <60 kg and 13% lower for 
patients weighing >90 kg compared with the 60-90 kg weight group. Area under the curve (AUC) over 
dosing interval (AUCτ) values were estimated to be 26% higher for patients weighing <60 kg and 21% 
lower for patients weighing >90 kg compared with the 60-90 kg weight group.  
Other PK parameters (Peripheral volume [V2], Intercompartmental clearance [Q] and Time-dependent 
clearance  [CLT0])  also  increased  with  body  weight.  Peripheral  volumes  (V2),  inter-compartment 
clearance  (Q)  and  initial  time-dependent  clearance  (CLT0)  were  respectively  31%,  28%,  and  35% 
lower  in  patients  weighing  48.5  kg  compared  to  the  reference  patient  (75  kg),  and  were  respectively 
45%, 39%, and 53% higher in patients weighing 116 kg compared to the reference patient (the values 
of 48.5 and 116 kg represent 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of body weight in the analysis data set).  
Data  for  efficacy  and  safety  stratified  on  both  weight  (</≥75  kg)  and  BMI  (</≥25  kg/m2)  and  by 
exposure  quartiles  (by  Cmax)  showed  that  body  weight,  though  inversely  correlate  to  exposure,  did 
not  influence  on  ARR.  Further,  the  increased  exposure  seen  in  patients  with  low  BMI  was  not 
associated  with  an  increased  frequency  of  adverse  events,  serious  infections  or  infusion  related

reactions.  However,  there  was  a  tendency  towards  a  greater  risk  reduction  in  confirmed  disability 
progression (CDP) in the subgroup of patients with a baseline body weight <75 kg (thus patients with 
a  higher  exposure)  compared  to  patients  with  a  body  weight  ≥75  kg  (lower  exposure).  This  could 
support  a  weight-based  dosing  regimen  however,  there  is  no  clinical  data  supporting  a  weight-based 
dosing regimen.  
Race  and  age  were  not  found  to  influence  the  PK  of  ocrelizumab  but  of  note,  no  children  (age  <18 
years) nor elderly (age >65 years) were included in the clinical studies. This is adequately addressed in 
the SmPC.  
Table 5 shows the covariate effects included in the final model.  
Table 5 Covariate Effects in the Final Covariate Model 133 
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
The  most  prevalent  AEs  associated  with  treatment  with  the  proposed  recommended  dose  of 
ocrelizumab (600 mg IV) were IRRs and infections.   
Correlation  between  individual  exposure  and  occurrence  and  grade  of  SAE,  serious  infections,  and 
occurrence  and  grade  of  IRRs  indicated  that  there  was  no  relationship  with  exposure  for  patients 
receiving the ocrelizumab 600 mg IV regimen across the Phase II and Phase III studies. Rates of SAE, 
serious infection, and IRRs seemed higher for patients receiving the ocrelizumab 1000 mg IV (i.e., first 
dose  2000  mg)  dosing  regimen  in  the  Phase  II  studies  but  the  sample  size  of  this  group  was  small 
compared  with  the  600  mg  regimen,  and  95%  confidence  intervals  overlapped,  thus  not  allowing  a 
firm  conclusion.  Cmax  ocrelizumab  concentrations  were  not  higher  in  patients  that  experienced  SAE 
compared with patients without SAE within the 600 mg and 2000 mg group respectively. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The  phase  III  randomised,  double-blind,  parallel  group,  active  comparator  controlled  /  placebo 
controlled, multicentre trials in RMS patients (WA21092, OPERA I and WA21093, OPERA II) and PPMS 
patients  (WA25046,  ORATORIO)  studies  all  provide  clinical  pharmacology  data  for  ocrelizumab. 
However, additional supportive data are provided by the phase II study WA21493 in RRMS patients.

Population  PK  (pop-PK)  analyses  were  conducted  to  quantitatively  describe  the  PK  of  ocrelizumab  in 
MS patients and to evaluate the effects of relevant covariates that may contribute to the variability in 
exposure  in  individual  patients.  Evaluations  of  the  relationship  between  PK  and  PD,  clinical  efficacy, 
and  safety  events  were  conducted  to  quantitatively  assess  the  exposure-response  relationship  of 
ocrelizumab. Also studies with ocrelizumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) provided PD data. 
Mechanism of action 
Ocrelizumab  is  a  recombinant  humanised  monoclonal  antibody  (mAb)  that  selectively  targets  CD20-
expressing B-cells. CD20 is a cell surface antigen found on pre-B cells, mature and memory B-cells but 
not expressed on lymphoid stem cells and plasma cells. While ocrelizumab selectively depletes CD20-
expressing  B  cells,  the  capacity  of  B-cell  reconstitution  and  pre-existing  humoral  immunity  are 
preserved. 
B-cells  are  thought  to  play  an  important  role  in  the  pathogenesis  of  multiple  sclerosis  (MS)  by:  (1) 
Presenting auto-antigens and co-stimulatory signals to activate T-cells, (2) secreting pro-inflammatory 
cytokines  at  greater  relative  proportions  than  protective  cytokines,  (3)  producing  auto-antibodies 
which  may  cause  tissue  damage  and  activate  macrophages  and  natural  killer  cells,  and  (4)  creating 
meningeal  lymphoid  follicle-like  structures,  linked  to  microglia  activation,  local  inflammation  and 
neuronal loss in the nearby cortex. 
The precise mechanisms through which ocrelizumab exerts its therapeutic clinical effects in MS are not 
fully elucidated but involve immunomodulation through the reduction in the number and function of B-
cells.  These  changes  are  thought  to  be  responsible  for  the  consequent  improvement  of  the  disease 
course of MS. 
Primary pharmacology 
Ocrelizumab selectively targets and depletes CD20-expressing B-cells. B-cell depletion is therefore the 
expected PD action of ocrelizumab; hence B-cell count in peripheral blood was used as the PD marker. 
B-cell counts described refer to flow cytometric counts of CD19+ cells in the peripheral blood. The 
rapid and sustained depletion of the CD19+ B-cell count in blood is shown in Figure 3

Median B-Cell Count (WA21092, WA21093) 
The median time to repletion (return to baseline or LLN, whichever was lower) of B-cells was 72 weeks 
(range  27  to  175  weeks)  after  treatment  with  600  mg  ocrelizumab.  Ninety  percent  (90%)  of  all 
patients had their B-cells repleted to LLN or baseline by approximately 2.5 years (120 weeks) after the 
last infusion. The longest individual time to repletion was 241 weeks after the last dose of ocrelizumab, 
in a patient treated first with interferon beta-1a IM and then with 600 mg ocrelizumab every 24 weeks. 
Figure 4 WA21493: Time to B-Cell Repletion 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
There was no apparent relationship between ocrelizumab exposure and the primary endpoint of ARR in 
RMS.  Both  RMS  and  PPMS  patients  showed  a  trend  for  greater  risk  reduction  for  CDP  with  higher 
exposure of ocrelizumab and all ocrelizumab groups showed a benefit compared with control (HR <1).

Due  to  the  pronounced  B-cell  depletion,  it  was  by  the  initial  assessment  questioned,  if  there  is  a 
potential PD interactions with ocrelizumab and (live attenuated) vaccines. In order to further elucidate 
this  issue,  the  Applicant  informed  that  a  multi-centre  randomised,  open-label,  Phase  IIIb  study 
(BN29739,  VELOCE)  is  currently  ongoing.  It  is  endorsed  that  the  Applicant  submit  both  the  primary 
study report (expected Q4 2017) and the final study report (expected Q1 2023) for assessment when 
available.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic  (PK)  data  derive  from  three  pivotal  phase  III  studies  (Study  WA21092  and  Study 
WA21093 in patients with RMS and Study WA25046 in patients with PPMS) and a supporting phase II 
dose-finding  study  (Study  WA21493).  In  these  studies,  1,423  MS  patients  were  treated  with 
ocrelizumab  and  had  available  PK  data.  Pop-PK  analyses  and  exposure-response  analyses  were 
submitted in support of the PK and PD dossier. The statistical analyses as well as the methods for the 
pop-PK analyses are considered adequate and justified.  
During  the  clinical  development  program,  5  versions  of  ocrelizumab  have  been  used  (v0.1–v0.4  and 
v1.0). Version 0.4 has been use in the pivotal MS studies WA21092, WA21093, WA25046, whereas in 
study  WA21493 three  batches  of  version  0.2,  four  batches  of  version  0.3  and  five  batches  of  version 
0.4 were used. Version 1.0 is intended for commercial use but has not been used in any of the pivotal 
studies.  It  is  currently  used  in  the  open-label  extension  studies,  but  no  clinical  data  from  this  study 
have  been  submitted.  Bioequivalence  studies  between  any  of  the  product  versions  have  not  been 
performed  but  analytical  comparability  has  been  performed  between  v0.1  and  v0.2,  v0.2  and  v0.3, 
v0.3 and v0.4 and v0.4 and v1.0. The comparability approach is evaluated in the Quality assessment 
report.

The main difference between the versions relates to the glycosylation. This is not expected to impact 
the PK of ocrelizumab but it potentially affects the PD as the glycosylation has effect on the ADCC and 
CDC activity. The ADCC (max) and CDC activity/potency is lower in the version v1.0 compared to the 
initial versions (v0.1-v0.4); this can at least theoretical impact efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab.  
To further overcome this issue, the Applicant informed that the proposed marketing material would be 
aligned with material used in the pivotal trials. Further, the Applicant committed to provide PK and PD 
(blood B-cell depletion) data for the 2014 v1.0 material as a post-marketing commitment if required. 
At the response on Day 180, the Applicant informs that at the quality level several actions have been 
taken  to  assure  that  the  commercial  v1.0  process  manufacture  ocrelizumab  of  the  same  quality  as 
used in the pivotal clinical trial (v0.4). Both ADCC and CDC, which is considered part of mechanism of 
action of ocrelizumab, is influenced by the glycosylation profile of the molecule. Manganese has been 
shown  to  influence  the  glycosylation  with  consequential  impact  on  potency.  Manufacturing  process 
controls are implemented to measure the manganese level in the fermentation process. In addition to 
the test for CDC, the Applicant has introduced a test for ADCC in the release specification of the drug 
substance.  The  two  glycoforms  G0  and  G0-F  is  also  controlled.  All  test  limits  are  aligned  with  the 
clinical  experience  of  v0.4  drug  substance.  Due  to  these  findings  of  comparability  between  the  two 
manufacturing processes, the Applicant does not consider that it is necessary to present clinical data. 
This is agreed and therefore clinical PK and PD data will not be requested 
Ocrelizumab  is  administered  as  intravenous  injections,  and  therefore  the  bioavailability  is  100%. 
Ocrelizumab  is  distributed  in  a  two-compartment  model.  The  central  volume  of  distribution  was 
approximately  2.78  L  indicating  that,  as  many  other  mAbs  and  due  to  the  large  size  (approximately 
148 kDa) and the hydrophilic nature of the molecule, ocrelizumab is distributed mainly in the vascular 
compartment.  The  peripheral  volume  of  distribution  (2.68  L  in  the  population  PK  model  for  studies 
WA21092,  WA21093  and  WA21493  and  2.42  L  in  Study  WA25046)  probably  mostly  representing  the 
lymphatic  liquid.  Like  other  antibodies,  ocrelizumab  is  assumed  to  be  degraded  into  smaller  proteins 
and  amino  acids.  The  terminal  elimination  half-life  (T½)  is  26  days,  thus  comparable  to  the  T½  of 
endogenous IgG. At lower doses (up to 400 mg) T½ was decreased due to a higher clearance but with 
higher  doses  (>400  mg)  an  approximately  constant  clearance  was  observed  resulting  in  a  dose 
proportional  increase  in  Cmax  and  AUCinf.  The  decrease  in  clearance  observed  with  higher  doses  of 
ocrelizumab  is  most  likely  predominantly  explained  by  saturation  of  the  target-mediated  pathway. 
Ocrelizumab AUC and Cmax are approximately dose-proportional between 600 mg and 2000 mg. After 
multiple dosing, the time-dependent clearance was approximately linear with only a small decrease in 
clearance which can be explained by a depletion of B-cells and thereby a saturation in the non-specific 
clearance  (salvage  pathway).    With  the  recommended  dosing  regimen,  steady  state  is  reached  after 
the second dosing. 
Inter-individual variability has not been specifically addressed, but data show that the inter-individual 
variability  in  PK  parameters  was  moderate  (up  to  30%).    There  is  no  data  regarding  intra-individual 
variability, however, this has adequately been justified by the Applicant. Ocrelizumab was dosed with a 
fixed dosage for all patients.  
Weight  was  found  to  be  the  strongest  covariate  with  influence  on  both  clearance,  volume  of 
distribution, Cmax and AUCτ. Over the dosing interval (AUCτ) values were estimated to be 26% higher 
for patients weighing <60 kg and 21% lower for patients weighing >90 kg compared with the 60-90 kg 
weight group. Thus, body weight was inversely correlate to exposure (i.e. patients with a higher weight 
had  a  lower  exposure  to  ocrelizumab).  To  further  elucidate  the  possible  clinical  impact  of  these 
findings, the Applicant presented data for efficacy and safety stratified on both weight (</≥75 kg) and 
BMI  (</≥25  kg/m2)  and  by  exposure  quartiles  (by  Cmax).  These  data  showed  that  body  weight, 
though  inversely  correlated  to  exposure,  did  not  influence  on  ARR.  Further,  the  increased  exposure 
seen  in  patients  with  low  BMI  was  not  associated  with  an  increased  frequency  of  adverse  events, 
serious infections or infusion related reactions. However, there was a tendency towards a greater risk 
reduction  in  confirmed  disability  progression  (CDP)  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  a  baseline  body 
weight <75 kg (thus patients with a higher exposure) compared to patients with a body weight ≥75 kg 
(lower  exposure).  This  supports  a  weight-based  dosing  regimen  however,  there  is  no  clinical  data 
supporting a weight-based dosing regimen and it is concluded that the issue needs not to be pursued. 
Gender  as  well  as  B-cell  count  at  baseline  were  found  to  be  statistically  significant  covariates  on 
volume of distribution and for the constant clearance respectively, but the differences were small and

not  expected  to  be  clinically  relevance.  No  dose-adjustment  is  considered  necessary  in  any  of  the 
subgroups of special populations based on PK. 
All  pivotal  PK  studies  have  been  performed  in  the  target  population,  namely  patients  with  MS.  No 
dedicated studies in any special population have been performed but the influence of various covariate 
parameters was evaluated in pop-PK analyses. Impaired hepatic or renal function was not observed to 
influence the PK of ocrelizumab but only one patient with severe impaired renal function was included 
in  the  analyses.  In  order  to  further  substantiate  the  experience  with  ocrelizumab  in  patients  with 
hepatic impairment, the Applicant upon request, presented exposure data for RMS and PPMS patients 
stratified according to the NCI-ODWG classification. As expected, based on the known pharmacokinetic 
profile  for  antibodies,  mild  hepatic  impairment  did  not  affect  the  exposure  of  ocrelizumab.  Only  few 
patients  with  moderate  and  severe  hepatic  impairment  were  included  and  no  conclusions  could  be 
drawn  for  these  special  populations.  The  SmPC  is  updated  with  the  information.  Overall,  no  dose-
adjustment is considered necessary in patients with impaired renal/hepatic function.   
There  seem  to  be  no  clear  relationship  between  exposure  (Cmean  and  AUC)  and  adverse  events 
however,  the  sample  size  of  the  population  treated  with  the  highest  dose  is  small  limiting  firm 
conclusions.  As  only  three  patients  developed  anti-drug  antibodies  (ADAs)  this  has  not  been 
investigated as a covariate influencing the PK of ocrelizumab. Ocrelizumab has not been investigated in 
elderly (age >65 years) or in children (age <18 years). This is adequately addressed in the SmPC. 
Pharmacodynamics  
Ocrelizumab  is  a  recombinant  humanised  mAb  that  exerts  immunomodulatory  effects  by  relatively 
selectively  targeting  and  depleting  CD20-expressing  B  cells.  However,  the  mechanism  through  which 
ocrelizumab causes beneficial effects in MS is not fully understood. 
Since ocrelizumab binds to CD20, and its presence in blood interferes with a B-cell count based on the 
surface  antigen  CD20  itself,  CD19  was  used  as  a  marker  for  CD20  expression  during  B-cell 
development; this is accepted. The depletion of the CD19+ B-cell count in blood is rapid and sustained. 
The median time to repletion was 72 weeks. The proposed posology entails dosing every 6 months and 
the rationale for this dosing regimen is acceptable.  
No  formal  (PK  or  PD)  drug-drug  interaction  studies  were  performed,  which  is  acceptable  for  a  mAb. 
Due  to  the  effective  and  long-lasting  PD  effect  by  depleting  CD20-expressing  B-cells,  the  efficacy  of 
vaccinations  and  indeed  also  the  safety  if  giving  live  attenuated  vaccines  (e.g.  BCG  vaccination  and 
yellow  fever  vaccination)  was  questioned  by  the  initial  assessment.  In  order  to  further  elucidate  this 
issue,  the  MAH  informs  that  a  multi-centre  randomised,  open-label,  Phase  IIIb  study  (BN29739, 
VELOCE) is currently ongoing. The primary study report is planned to be available in Q4 2017 and the 
final study report in Q1 2023. The Applicant has clarified that the primary study report will be based on 
the clinical cut-off date (14. February 2017) whereas the final study report will be based on data from 
‘Last- patient last visit’. Further, the Applicant agrees to the post approval commitment of submitting 
both  study  reports  as  well  as  any  necessary  changes  to  labelling  and/or  to  the  RMP  within  one  year 
from the last data-collection. The information provided in the SmPC is acceptable and adequately, the 
information  also  encourages  the  treating  physician  to  Physicians  consider  the  immunisation  status  of 
patients  prior  to  treatment  with  ocrelizumab  as  vaccinations  (at  least  with  live  attenuated  vaccines) 
should be completed at least 6 weeks prior to initiation of treatment. Furthermore, the RMP has been 
updated  with  information  regarding  potential  interactions  with  both  live  (attenuated)  vaccines  and 
potential  drug-drug  interactions  with  other  immunomodulatory  multiple  sclerosis  (MS)  therapies; 
especially  the  safety  of  ocrelizumab  following  or  concomitant  with  other  immunosuppressive/ 
immunomodulating disease modifying therapies (DMTs) is unclear. Impaired immunisation response’ is 
included  as  an  important  identified  potential  risk,  and  ‘Risk  of  infections’  is  included  as  an  ‘important 
identified risk’ in the RMP. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Ocrelizumab  is  a  recombinant  humanised  monoclonal  antibody  that  exerts  immunomodulatory  effects 
by relatively selectively targeting and depleting CD20-expressing B cells.  
The pharmacokinetic profile of ocrelizumab is overall well characterised.   
The CHMP made the following recommendations:

Study WA21493  
The Study WA21493 was a supportive Phase II, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, 
placebo  controlled,  dose  finding  study,  with  open-label  active  comparator  group  (interferon  beta-1a 
IM; Avonex 30 ug IM weekly). The placebo and active controlled part of the trial had a duration of 24 
weeks  (Cycle  1)  followed  by  ocrelizumab  (OCR)  600  mg  or  1000  mg  for  three  additional  treatment 
cycles  up  to  Week  94.  The  study  was  designed  both  as  a  proof  of  concept  for  ocrelizumab  in  RRMS, 
and  as  a  dose  finding  study  to  inform  the  Phase  III  program.  The  objectives  were  to  evaluate  the 
efficacy  as  measured  by  brain  MRI  lesions,  and  safety  of  2  dose  regimens  of  ocrelizumab  in  patients 
with  RRMS.  The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  total  number  of  gadolinium-enhancing  T1  lesions 
observed  on  MRI  scans  of  the  brain  at  weeks  12,  16,  20,  and  24.  Secondary  efficacy  endpoints 
included  additional  MRI  outcomes  for  the  first  24  weeks  and  annualized  relapse  rate  (ARR)  by  Week 
24.  
Of the 220 patients randomized, 218 received study treatment and 205 (93%) completed the 24-week 
placebo-controlled study period. The ITT and safety populations comprised the 218 patients who were

randomized  and  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  treatment.  Most  of  the  patients  were  female 
(59%-69%  in  the  four  dose  groups),  and  nearly  all  were  Caucasian  (93%-98%).  The  mean  age  of 
patients across the four treatment groups ranged from 35.6 to 38.5 years (the absolute range was 19–
56 years). 
The study met its primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints. A statistically significant treatment 
effect on total T1 Gd-enhancing lesions on scans performed at weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24, on total new 
T1 Gd-enhancing lesions at weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24, and on ARR at week 24 was demonstrated 
for  both  ocrelizumab  doses.  The  mean  (standard  deviation  [SD])  number  of  Gd  enhancing  lesions  at 
weeks  12,  16,  20,  and  24  was  reduced  by  89%,  to  0.6  (1.52)  (p<0.0001),  in  Group  B  (600  mg 
ocrelizumab)  and  by  96%,  to  0.2  (0.65)  (p<0.0001),  in  Group  A  (2000  mg  ocrelizumab),  compared 
with  5.6  (12.53)  in  the  placebo  group.  No  clear  separation  in  the  primary  endpoint  was  observed 
between Groups A and B (p = 0.15).

The  change  in  the  volume  of  T2  lesions  at  week  24  was  not  significantly  reduced  in  ocrelizumab 
patients  (Groups  A  and  B)  compared  with  placebo  and  interferon  beta-1a  IM  patients  (Groups  C  and 
D). The treatment benefit of ocrelizumab on the total number of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions at weeks 12, 
16, 20, and 24, and the unadjusted ARR at week 24 were consistently positive across all ocrelizumab 
subgroups based on a wide range of patient characteristics.

Treatment  with  both  doses  of  OCR  led  to  rapid  and  complete  depletion  of  CD19+  peripheral  B-cells, 
which  was  sustained  through  24  weeks  of  the  placebo-controlled.  At  week  24,  no  patients 
demonstrated  a  return  of  peripheral  CD19+  cell  counts  to  baseline  values  or  to  the  lower  limit  of 
normal (LLN) of 80 cells/μL, which was used as protocol-defined measures of recovery. 
Based  on  these  efficacy  findings,  and  the  safety  findings,  indicating  the  higher  dose  of  2,000  mg  of 
ocrelizumab was comparable to the lower dose of 600 mg, the Applicant elected to continue the phase 
III program (RMS and PPMS) with the posology of ocrelizumab 600 mg every 24 weeks. 
Studies WA21092 and WA21093 
The two studies in RMS mentioned above had an identical design and are therefore jointly described 
under below.   
Clinical  study  WA21092,  hereafter  also  referred  to  as  Study  21092.  Title  of  Study:  A  randomized, 
double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab in 
comparison to interferon beta-1a (Rebif®) in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis  
Clinical  study  WA21093  ,  hereafter  also  referred  to  as  Study  21093.  Title  of  Study:  A  randomized, 
double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab in 
comparison to interferon beta-1a (Rebif®) in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis  
Methods 
These  two  studies  were  randomized,  96-week,  double-blind,  double-dummy,  parallel-group,  active-
controlled phase III studies, designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab in comparison 
with interferon beta-1a in patients with RMS who experienced at least either two documented clinical 
attacks within 2 years or one clinical attack within one year prior to screening (but not within 30 days 
prior to screening). They consisted of the following periods: 
• Screening 
• Double-blind, double-dummy comparative treatment (96 weeks) 
• Safety follow-up (SFU) (minimum of 48 weeks) and B-cell monitoring (every 24 weeks) 
• Open label extension (OLE) screening 
• OLE 
Consenting patients were screened approximately 2 weeks prior to randomization. No study treatment 
was  administered  during  SFU  or  B-cell  monitoring.  During  OLE  all  patients  received  ocrelizumab. 
During  the  treatment period,  patients  attended  10 scheduled  assessment  visits  (at baseline,  Week  2, 
Week  12  and  thereafter  every  12  weeks).  Neurological  exams,  EDSS  and  MSFCS  were  collected  at 
baseline, Week 12 and then every 12 weeks. MRI was collected at baseline and every 24 weeks. SF-36 
was  collected  at  baseline  and  every  48  weeks.  Patients  were  assessed  for  safety  at  each  visit.  In 
addition, structured telephone interviews were conducted every 4 weeks from Week 8 to identify any 
new  or  worsening  neurological  symptoms  that  warranted  an  unscheduled  visit  and  to  collect  data  on 
possible  events  of  infections.  Unscheduled  visits  were  made  for  the  assessment  of  potential  relapses 
and safety, or if down titration of interferon beta-1a from 44 μg to 22 μg SC was needed. 
• 
Study participants 
RMS  (male  and  female)  patients  aged  18-55  years  with  a  diagnosis  of  MS  as  per  revised  McDonald 
criteria (2010) who experienced at least either two documented clinical attacks within 2 years or one 
clinical  attack  within  one  year  prior  to  screening  (but  not  within  30  days  prior  to  screening).  The 
inclusion criteria comprised subjects with RRMS as  well as relapsing SPMS,  neurological stability for ≥ 
30  days  prior  to  both  screening  and  baseline,.  EDSS  from  0  to  5.5  (inclusive)  at  screening  and 
documented  MRI  of  brain  with  abnormalities  consistent  with  MS  prior  to  screening.  The  exclusion 
criteria included: 
Assessment report  
EMA/790835/2017 
     Page 52/180 
 
 
 
 
-PPMS. 
-Disease duration of more than 10 years in patients with an EDSS ≤ 2.0 at screening. 
-Treatment  with  dalfampridine  (Ampyra®)  unless  on  stable  dose  for  ≥  30  days  prior  to  screening; 
wherever possible, patients remained on stable doses throughout the 96-week treatment period. 
-Previous treatment with B-cell targeted therapies (i.e. rituximab, ocrelizumab, atacicept, belimumab, 
or ofatumumab). 
-Systemic corticosteroid therapy within 4 weeks prior to screening. The screening period was extended 
(but could not exceed 8 weeks) for patients who had used systemic corticosteroids for their MS before

Table 10 Overview of the Interferon Beta-1a/Placebo Dosing Regimen 
For  patients  who  experienced  a  relapse  during  the  study  a  standardized  treatment  regimen  of  1 g  IV 
methylprednisolone  per  day  for  5  consecutive  days  was  recommended  if  judged  clinically  appropriate 
by the treating investigator. 
• 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  assess  whether  the  efficacy  of  ocrelizumab  600  mg  every 
24 weeks (given as two infusions of 300 mg on Days 1 and 15 of the first 24-week treatment period, 
and  as  a  single  infusion  of  600  mg  subsequently)  was  superior  to  interferon  beta-1a  44  µg  SC  as 
measured by the protocol-defined annualized relapse rate (ARR) by 2 years (96 weeks) in patients with 
RMS. 
The  key  secondary  objectives  of  this  study  were  to  evaluate  whether  the  efficacy  of  ocrelizumab 
600 mg was superior to interferon beta-1a 44 µg SC, as reflected by the following measures: 
-  The  time  to  onset  of  confirmed  disability  progression  (CDP)  for  at  least  12  weeks  with  the  initial 
event of neurological worsening occurring during the 96-week, double-blind, double-dummy, treatment 
period. 
- The total number of T1 gadolinium (Gd) - enhancing lesions as detected by brain magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) at Weeks 24, 48, and 96. 
-  The  total  number  of  new,  and/or  enlarging  T2  hyperintense  lesions  as  detected  by  brain  MRI  at 
Weeks 24, 48, and 96. 
- The proportion of patients who had confirmed disability improvement (CDI) for at least 12 weeks with 
the  initial  event  of  neurological  improvement  occurring  during  the  96-week,  double-blind,  double-
dummy, treatment period. 
-  The  time  to  onset  of  CDP  for  at  least  24  weeks,  with  the  initial  event  of  neurological  worsening 
occurring during the 96-week, double-blind, double-dummy, treatment period. 
- The total number of new T1 hypointense lesions (chronic black holes) at Weeks 24, 48, and 96. 
- The change in Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) score from baseline to Week 96. 
- The percentage change in brain volume as detected by brain MRI from Week 24 to Week 96. 
-  The  change  in  Short  Form  36  (SF-36)  Physical  Component  Summary  (PCS)  Score  from  baseline  to 
Week 96. 
- The proportion of patients who had no evidence of disease activity (NEDA) by Week 96.

Safety: 
- To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ocrelizumab 600 mg every 24 weeks (given as two infusions 
of ocrelizumab 300 mg on Days 1 and 15 of the first 24-week treatment period and as a single infusion 
of 600 mg subsequently) in patients with RMS (including exploratory, long-term safety and tolerability 
in those patients entering the OLE). 
Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics: 
-  To  explore  the  pharmacokinetics  (PK),  immunogenicity  and  pharmacodynamics  (PD)  of  ocrelizumab 
in patients with RMS. 
In  addition,  there  were  around  30  explorative  objectives  (not  listed  here)  mainly  related  to  clinical 
efficacy and MRI findings. 
• 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the protocol-defined ARR at 2 years (96 weeks). A protocol-defined 
relapse (PDR) was described by all of the following criteria: 
- occurrence of new or worsening neurological symptoms attributable to MS 
- symptoms persisting for >24 hours 
-  symptoms  not  attributable  to  confounding  clinical  factors  (e.g.,  fever,  infection,  injury,  adverse 
reactions to medications) 
- symptoms immediately preceded by a stable or improving neurological state for at least 30 days 
-  symptoms  accompanied  by  objective  neurological  worsening  consistent  with  an  increase  of  at  least 
half  a  step  on  the  Expanded  Disability  Status  Scale  (EDSS),  or  2  points  on  one  of  the  appropriate 
Functional System Score (FSS), or 1 point on two or more of the appropriate FSS; the change had to 
affect the selected FSS (i.e., pyramidal, ambulation, cerebellar, brainstem, sensory, or visual). 
Episodic  spasms,  sexual  dysfunction,  fatigue,  mood  change,  or  bladder  or  bowel  urgency  or 
incontinence did not suffice to establish a relapse. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints, which were to be analyzed in a hierarchical order, were: 
-  The  time  to  onset  of  CDP  for  at  least  12  weeks,  with  the  initial  event  of  neurological  worsening 
occurring during the 96-week, double-blind, double-dummy treatment period. 
- The total number of T1 Gd-enhancing lesions as detected by brain MRI at Weeks 24, 48, and 96. 
- The total number of new and/or enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions as detected by brain MRI at Weeks 
24, 48, and 96. 
- The proportion of patients who have CDI for at least 12 weeks, with the initial event of neurological 
improvement occurring during the 96-week, double-blind, double-dummy treatment period. 
-  The  time  to  onset  of  CDP  for  at  least  24  weeks,  with  the  initial  event  of  neurological  worsening 
occurring during the 96-week, double-blind, double-dummy treatment period. 
- The total number of new T1 hypointense lesions at Weeks 24, 48, and 96. 
- The change in MSFC score from baseline to Week 96. 
- The percentage change in brain volume as detected by brain MRI from Week 24 to Week 96. 
- The change in SF-36 PCS Score from baseline to Week 96. 
- The proportion of patients who have NEDA by Week 96. 
The  listing  above  of  the  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  does  not  reflect  the  hierarchical  order  for  the 
statistical testing (instead please refer to the section “Statistical methods”). For the statistical testing

CDP 12 weeks, CDI 12 weeks and CDP 24 weeks, data from Studies 21092 and 21093 were planned to 
be pooled.  
The  MRI  assessments  were  standardised  and  read  by  a  centralized  MRI  reading  center  for  efficacy 
endpoints.  Brain  volume  at  24  weeks  had  been  chosen  as  the  reference  point  in  this  secondary 
outcome to account for a potential pseudoatrophy effect that might theoretically occur early after the 
initiation of an anti-inflammatory treatment.  
Confirmed Disability Progression Definition 
Disability progression was defined as an increase in the EDSS score of: 
- ≥ 1.0 point from the baseline EDSS score when the baseline score was ≤ 5.5 
- ≥ 0.5 point from the baseline EDSS score when the baseline score was > 5.5 
and not attributable to another etiology (e.g., fever, concurrent illness, or concomitant medication). 
Disability  progression  was  considered  confirmed  when  the  increase  in  the  EDSS  was  confirmed  at  a 
regularly scheduled visit at least 12 weeks or 24 weeks, after the initial documentation of neurological 
worsening. The initial event of neurological worsening had to occur during the 96-week, double-blind, 
double-dummy treatment period. 
Confirmed Disability Improvement Definition 
Disability improvement was assessed only for the subgroup of patients with a baseline EDSS score of ≥ 
2.0. It was defined as a reduction in EDSS score of: 
- ≥ 1.0 from the baseline EDSS score when the baseline score was ≥ 2 and ≤ 5.5 
- ≥ 0.5 when the baseline EDSS score > 5.5. 
All patients without confirmed disability improvement were counted as not improved, independently of 
follow-up time.  
No Evidence of Disease Activity Definition 
NEDA was defined only for patients with a baseline EDSS score ≥ 2.0. Patients who completed the 96-
week treatment period were considered as having evidence of disease activity if at least one protocol-
defined relapse, a CDP event or at least one MRI scan showing MRI activity (defined as Gd-enhancing 
T1  lesions,  or  new  or  enlarging  T2  lesions)  was  reported  during  the  96-week  treatment  period, 
otherwise the patient was considered as having NEDA. Patients who discontinued treatment early with 
at least one event before early discontinuation were considered as having evidence of disease activity.  
• 
Sample size 
The  sample  size  was  estimated  based  on  data  from  previous  RRMS  trials,  with  the  use  of  two-sided 
tests  with  an  experiment-wise  alpha  of  0.05.  The  ARR  at  96  weeks  in  patients  receiving  ocrelizumab 
was predicted to be 0.165 (standard deviation [SD] of approximately 0.60), compared with 0.33 (SD 
of  approximately  0.80)  in  patients  receiving  interferon  beta-1a,  representing  a  relative  reduction  of 
50%  on  ocrelizumab  compared  with  interferon  beta-1a.  For  the  ARR,  a  t-test  was  used  to  determine 
the sample size between the OCR group and the IFN group. The sample size of 400 patients per group 
was predicted to provide 84% power, maintaining the type I error rate of 0.05, and assuming a drop-
out  rate  of  20%  approximately  (assuming  a  relative  reduction  among  patient  drop-out  of  25%).  For 
confirmed disability progression, a two group log-rank test, with the assumption of exponential survival 
and  exponential  dropout  was  used  to  determine  the  sample  size.  Assuming  the  2-year  confirmed 
disability  progression  rate  is  18%  for  the  IFN  group  and  12.6%  for  the  OCR  group,  representing  a 
relative reduction of 30% on ocrelizumab compared with interferon beta-1a, and assuming a dropout 
rate  of  20  percent  over  2  years  approximately,  the  sample  size  of  400  per  group  was  predicted  to 
provide 80% power, maintaining the type I error rate of 0.05 based on the pooled analysis of two RMS 
trials (800 patients treated with ocrelizumab and 800 patients treated with interferon beta-1a).

• 
Randomisation 
Eligible  patients  were  randomized  to  2  groups  in  a  1:1  ratio  via  an  independent  IxRS  provider. 
Randomization  was  stratified  by  region  (United  States  versus  rest  of  the  world  [ROW])  and  baseline 
EDSS (<4.0 versus ≥4.0). The block size was 4 for each stratum. The patient Randomization List was 
generated  by  IxRS  using  a  pre-defined  randomization  specification.  Patient  randomization  numbers 
were allocated sequentially in the order in which the patients were enrolled.  
The randomization list was not available at the study center, to the monitors, project statisticians or to 
the  Sponsor’s  project  team.  Randomized  patients  were  assigned  a  unique  treatment  box  number 
(medication number) and randomization number that was incorporated into the double-blind labeling. 
The IxRS provider held the treatment assignment codes. 
• 
Blinding (masking) 
This  study  had  a  double-blind,  double-dummy  design  with  the  treatment  duration  of  96  weeks, 
followed by the OLE. Site personnel remained blinded to the patient treatment allocation in the double-
blind  treatment  period  until  approximately  24  weeks  after  the  Week  96  visit  of  the  last  patient 
randomized, to allow the confirmation of the last 24-week confirmed disability progression event. This 
resulted in the treatment assignment in the double-blind period remaining blinded in the OLE at least 
until the database lock for the 96-week period. To prevent potential unblinding during the double-blind, 
double-dummy treatment period, the following additional measures were implemented: 
•  dedicated  role  of  the  examining  investigator  /  EDSS  assessor  who  was  not  involved  with  any 
aspect  of  medical  management  of  the  patient  and  did  not  have  access  to  patient  data.  The 
examining  investigator  performed  the  neurological  examination,  documented  the  Functional 
System Scores (FSS) and assessed the EDSS and the Karnofsky Performance Status Scale. 
•  blinding  of  selected  laboratory  parameters  that  could  reveal  patient’s  allocation  to  study 
treatment.  Note  that  these  laboratory  parameters  remained  blinded  during  the  double-blind, 
double-dummy  treatment,  SFU,  OLE  Screening,  and  during  the  first  dose  of  ocrelizumab  during 
the OLE (Dose 5). 
•  all scheduled on-study MRI scans were assessed by an independent, central MRI reader who was 
blinded  to  the  treatment  assignment.  All  scans  were  also  reviewed  locally  for  safety  by  a 
radiologist who was blinded to treatment assignment. 
Unblinding for the ongoing safety monitoring by the iDMC, was performed according to procedures in 
place  to  ensure  integrity  of  the  data  (cf.  iDMC  Charter).  Unblinding  for  analysis  of  biological  samples 
and pharmacokinetic data analysis was performed according to procedures in place to ensure integrity 
of the data. 
Unblinding of treatment assignment by the site could only occur in the case of emergency situations, 
where  the  knowledge  of  what  study  medication  the  patient  was  receiving  was  critical  for  clinical 
management. Unblinding was performed by means of the IxRS. 
As  per  regulatory  reporting  requirements,  the  Sponsor  unblinded  the  identity  of  study  medication  for 
all unexpected serious adverse events (SAEs) that were considered by the investigator to be related to 
study  drug  per  safety  reference  document(s),  (e.g.,  Investigator’s  Brochure,  Core  Data  Sheet,  and 
Summary of Product Characteristics).

Statistical methods 
The  statistical  testing  hierarchy  for  Studies  WA21092  and  WA21093  are  summarized  in  the  Figure  6.  
Data  from  the  studies  were  pooled  for  analysis  of  CDP  and  CDI  in  order  to  have  sufficient  statistical 
power to detect treatment differences between ocrelizumab and interferon beta-1a 44 over the course 
of the study duration of 96 weeks.

The hierarchical analysis was to be undertaken only once the primary endpoint of ARR had been shown 
to  be  positive  in  both  trials,  and  following  that  the  secondary  endpoints  were  to  be  tested  in  the 
sequence  presented  in  the  diagram,  all  at  the  α=0.05  level.    Subsequent  endpoints  could  only  be 
tested in a confirmatory manner if all preceding endpoints had reached a significance level of 0.05 
Figure 5 Statistical testing hierarchy for Studies WA21092 and WA21093 
ARR = annualized  relapse  rate;  CDI = confirmed  disability  improvement;  CDP = confirmed  disability 
progression;  Gd = gadolinium;  MSFC = Multiple  Sclerosis  Functional  Composite;  NEDA = no  evidence  of 
disease activity; SF-36 PCS = short form 36 Physical Component Summary 
The  hierarchical  order  of  secondary  endpoints  was  based  primarily  on  clinical  meaningfulness  (i.e., 
those  endpoints that  were  clinically  more  meaningful  are listed  higher in  the  hierarchy).  In  situations 
where  endpoints  had  similar  clinical  relevance,  those  endpoints  with  a  greater  chance  of  achieving  a 
statistically significant treatment difference were listed higher in the hierarchy. For example, given the 
lower  number  of  24-week  CDP  events  than  12-week  CDP  events,  there  was  a  lower  chance  of 
achieving a statistically significant treatment difference, and thus 24-week CDP was listed lower in the 
hierarchy.  In  addition,  established  rather  than  novel  endpoints  were  given  higher  priority  within  the 
hierarchy.

The statistical methods employed for each type of endpoint are summarized in Table 11. Patients who 
discontinued  study  treatment  early  during  the  double-blind  period  were  censored  at  the  date  of 
discontinuation.  However,  the  effects  of  different  methods  for  handling  missing  data  were  tested  as 
part of the pre-specified sensitivity analyses.

Pre-specified sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint included inter alia: 
•  ARR  calculated  including  all  protocol-defined  relapses  occurring  during  the  double-blind,  double-
dummy  period  or  the  SFU,  up  to  96  weeks  after  randomization.  This  analysis  used  all  available  data 
and  estimated  the  treatment  effect  up  to  96  weeks  irrespective  of  whether  patients  were  on  study 
treatment or not. 
• Per-protocol population 
• Adjustment by additional covariates (number of relapses within 2 years prior to study entry, baseline 
Gd lesions [presence vs. absence], prior MS treatment, age [<40, ≥ 40 years]) 
•  Use  of  two  different  methods  for  handling  missing  data  (patients  prematurely  withdrawn  from 
treatment),  to  explore  the  potential  influence  of  informative  dropouts  on  the  results  of  the  primary 
efficacy analysis (only data from the double blind double dummy treatment period was considered): 
-  Multiple  imputation:  for  patients  that  discontinued  early  during  the  double-blind,  double-
dummy  treatment  period  without  any  PDR  in  the  30  days  prior  to  discontinuation,  50%  of 
patients were randomly assigned an event of relapse on day of discontinuation, and 50% were 
censored on day of discontinuation. 
-  With  imputation:  patients  that  discontinued  early  during  the  double-blind,  double-dummy 
treatment  period  without  any  PDR  in  the  30  days  prior  to  discontinuation,  were  counted  as 
having had a relapse on day of discontinuation. 
Pre-specified sensitivity analyses of the secondary endpoints Time to CDP at 12 and 24 Weeks were: 
• Per-protocol population 
• Adjustment by additional covariates (number of relapses within 2 years prior to study entry, baseline 
Gd lesions (presence vs. absence), prior MS treatment, age [<40, ≥ 40 years]) 
•  Use  of  two  different  methods  for  handling  missing  data  (patients  prematurely  withdrawn  from 
treatment),  to  explore  the  potential  influence  of  informative  dropouts  on  the  results  of  the  primary 
efficacy  analysis.  (only  information  from  the  double  blind-double  dummy  treatment  period  was 
considered): 
- Multiple imputation: for patients that discontinued the treatment early with an initial disability 
progression  during  the  double-blind,  double-dummy  treatment  period  without  a  subsequent 
scheduled  visit  with  EDSS  measurement,  50%  of  patients  were  randomly  assigned  event  of 
CDP on day of initial disability progression, and 50% were censored on day of initial disability 
progression. 
-With  imputation:  patients  that  discontinued  the  treatment  early  with  an  initial  disability 
progression  during  the  double-blind,  double-dummy  treatment  period  without  a  subsequent 
scheduled visit with EDSS measurement counted as having had CDP on day of initial disability 
progression. 
The primary and some of the secondary efficacy endpoints (12- and 24-week CDP) were summarized 
and analyzed by predefined subgroups: 
• Age ( ≥ 40 vs. <40 years) 
• Sex (male vs. female) 
• Race (White vs. other) 
• Body weight: ≥ 75 kg versus < 75 kg 
• Geographical region (stratification factor) (United States vs. ROW) 
• Baseline EDSS score (stratification factor) (<4.0 vs. ≥ 4.0) 
• Previous lesions: baseline Gd-enhancing lesion (0 vs. > 0)

• 
Participant flow  
A total of 1051 patients were screened for entry into the study. Of these, 230 patients failed screening; 
the main reasons were failure to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria or unacceptable laboratory 
values (the number of screen failures is an estimate based on information collected in the IxRS). A 
total of 821 patients were enrolled in the study and were randomized 1:1 to interferon beta-1a (IFN 
group, N = 411) or ocrelizumab (OCR group, N = 410). In total, 706 patients (86%) received 
treatment and completed the double-blind treatment period up to Week 96. The proportion of patients 
who received treatment and completed the double-blind treatment period up to Week 96 was higher in 
the OCR group (89%) than in the IFN group (83%).  The difference in withdrawal from treatment 
between groups was mainly due to higher incidences of withdrawals due to adverse events (6% versus 
3%), withdrawal by subject (3% versus 2%) and lack of efficacy (3% versus 2%) in the IFN group 
versus the OCR group, respectively.

Baseline data 
The demographic characteristics of the ITT population were well balanced across the treatment groups. 
The  majority of  patients were  female  (66%  in  both  treatment  groups)  and  were  predominantly  white 
(91% − 92% across treatment groups with median ages of 37 and 38 years in the treatment groups 
(range 18 − 56 years). Patients’ median weight was 72 − 74 kg across groups (range 41 − 170 kg). 
Patients  were  mainly  from  Europe  (EU,  Switzerland  and  Norway;  approximately  50%  −  52%  across 
treatment  groups)  or  North  America  (USA  and  Canada)  and  Australia  (approximately  26%  in  each 
treatment  group).  The  two  treatment  groups  had  similar  MS  disease  histories.  The  median  duration 
since symptom onset was 4.62 years in the IFN group and 4.88 years in the OCR group. Approximately 
half (53% in each group) of patients had been diagnosed within 2 years prior to randomization. Almost 
all patients (98% in IFN group and 96% in OCR group) had experienced at least one relapse within 1 
year  prior  to  randomization.  The  baseline  MRI  disease  characteristics  of  patients  were  well  balanced 
between  the  treatment  groups.  Of  the  patients  in  the  IFN  group,  38%  had  one  or  more  T1 
Gdenhancing lesions at baseline; in the OCR group, 42% had one or more T1 Gd enhancing lesions at 
baseline. The number of T1 hypointense lesions, volume of T2 hyperintense lesions, and number of T2 
hyperintense  lesions  were  similar  between  the  groups.  Normalized  brain  volume  was  also  similar 
between the two groups. 
A total of 71% of patients in the IFN group and 74% of patients in the OCR group had not been treated 
with  any  MS  medication  in  the  2  years  prior  to  randomization.  The  number  of  patients  who  had 
received  MS  therapies  in  the  prior  two  years  was  relatively  balanced  between  treatment  groups.  The 
most  common  prior  treatments  for  MS  were  glatiramer  acetate  and  interferons.  There  were  no 
imbalances in the number of patients treated with a given medication. 
It was agreed that the patient characteristics were well balanced between the treatment groups.

Numbers analysed 
All 821 patients randomized to treatment were included in the ITT population which was appropriately 
defined for the primary efficacy analyses.  
• Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy variable 
The  study  met  its  primary  endpoint:  treatment  with  ocrelizumab  significantly  reduced  the  ARR  by 
46.4%  at  96  weeks  compared  with  interferon  beta-1a  (p  <  0.0001).  Highly  consistent  estimates  of 
treatment effect were observed in all pre-specified sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint. 
Patients  receiving  ocrelizumab  consistently  showed  a  greater  reduction  of  ARR  compared  with 
interferon beta-1a across all subgroups.  
Patients  aged  <  40  years  had  a  greater  reduction  of  ARR  on  ocrelizumab  versus  interferon  beta-1a 
(adjusted  ARR  ratio  0.423  [95%  CI:  0.284,  0.631],  p<0.0001)  compared  with  patients  aged  >  40 
years (adjusted ARR ratio 0.692 [95% CI: 0.447, 1.072], p = 0.0985).  
Patients  with  ≥  1  T1  Gd-enhancing  lesion  at  baseline  had  a  greater  reduction  of  ARR  on  ocrelizumab 
versus  interferon  beta-1a  (adjusted  ARR  ratio  0.313  [95%  CI:  0.198,  0.497],  p<0.0001)  compared 
with patients with no T1 Gd-enhancing lesions (ARR ratio 0.787 [95% CI: 0.539, 1.148], p = 0.2131). 
However,  both  age  groups,  and  both  patients  with  or  without  baseline  Gd-enhancing  lesions,  still 
showed a reduction of ARR on ocrelizumab compared with interferon beta-1a.  
No  notable  differences  were  observed  between  the  other  subgroups.  The  observed  effect  size  was 
regarded as clinically relevant. 
Secondary efficacy variables 
Results  of  several  secondary  endpoints  supported  the  primary  endpoint,  demonstrating  statistically 
significant  efficacy  of  ocrelizumab  when  compared  with  interferon beta-1a.    Treatment  with

ocrelizumab  resulted  in  significantly  greater  improvements  in  measures  of  disability  compared  with 
interferon beta-1a, namely: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
A  40%  risk  reduction  in  12-week  CDP  in  the  pooled  analysis  of  Studies  WA21092  and  WA21093 
(hazard ratio [HR] 0.60 [95% CI: 0.45, 0.81], p=0.0006). The individual study also demonstrated 
a 37% risk reduction of 12-week CDP (HR 0.63 [95% CI: 0.42, 0.92], p = 0.0169) 
A  40%  risk  reduction  in  24-week  CDP  in  the  pooled  analysis  of  Studies  WA21092  and  WA21093 
(HR  0.60  [95%  CI:  0.43,  0.84],  p=0.0025).  The  individual  study  also  demonstrated  a  37%  risk 
reduction of 24-week CDP (HR 0.63 [95% CI: 0.40, 0.98], p = 0.0370) 
A 33% relative increase in the proportion of patients with 12-week CDI in the pooled analysis of 
Studies WA21092 and WA21093 (relative risk [RR] 1.33 [95% CI: 1.05, 1.68], p=0.0194). In this 
study  a  14%  relative  increase  in  the  proportion  of patients  with  12-week  CDI  was  observed  (RR 
1.14 [95% CI: 0.84, 1.56], p = 0.4019) 
An  improvement  of  0.107  [95%  CI:  0.034,  0.180]  in  the  MSFC  score  change  from  baseline  to 
Week 96 (p = 0.0040) 
Treatment  with  ocrelizumab  consistently  resulted  in  significantly  greater  effects  on  the  following  MRI 
measures compared with interferon beta-1a:  
• 
• 
• 
A 94.9% relative reduction in the total number of T1-Gd enhancing lesions (p<0.0001)  
An 82.9% relative reduction in the total number of new and/or enlarging T2 lesions (p<0.0001) 
A 64.3% relative reduction in the total number of new T1-hypointense lesions (p<0.0001) 
Ocrelizumab  also  showed  statistically  significant  outcomes  in  additional  secondary  efficacy  endpoints 
compared  with  interferon  beta-1a,  which  were  not  formally  adjusted  for  multiplicity  and  not  formally 
statistically significant due to the hierarchichal testing strategy: 
• 
• 
Greater improvement of 1.159 (95% CI: 0.051, 2.268) in SF-36 PCS mean score from baseline to 
Week 96 (non-confirmatory p = 0.0404)  
A 81% relative increase in the proportion of patients with NEDA (non-confirmatory p<0.0001) 
Ocrelizumab  showed  a  numerically  superior  but  not  statistically  significant  outcome  in  the  remaining 
secondary endpoint compared to interferon beta-1a: 
• 
A  14.9%  relative  reduction  in  mean  percent  brain  volume  loss  from  Week  24  to  Week  96 
(p=0.0900)

A hierarchical approach was taken for significance testing in order to control for multiplicity. CDP and 
CDI endpoints were analyzed in a pooled population of Studies WA21092 and WA21093 due to a lack 
of  power  and  these  were  the  results  used  in  the  hierarchy.  A  summary  of  all  p-values  within  the 
hierarchical  structure  is  provided  in  the  table  below  (Table  14)    and  indicates  those  values  which 
should  be  considered  non-confirmatory  since  they  follow  a  non-significant  test  result  within  the 
hierarchy structure (shaded cells).  Importantly, the primary and secondary endpoints showing efficacy 
of ocrelizumab on both clinical and imaging measures of inflammation (ARR, T1 Gd-enhancing lesions 
and  new  and/or  enlarging  T2  lesions)  and  on  clinical  measures  of  disease  progression  (CDP,  new  T1 
hypointense lesions) were all met.

Patients  in  the  OCR  group  showed  fewer  T1  Gd-enhancing  lesions  when  compared  with  those  in  the 
IFN  group  from  as  early  as  Week  24  (90.8%  relative  reduction)  with  greater  suppression  of 
inflammatory  lesions  at  subsequent  visits  (relative  reductions  of  97.7%  and  95.4%  at  Weeks  48  and 
96  respectively).  This  reduction  was  seen  in  all  numerical  categories  of  lesions  as  shown  in  the 
summary of descriptive statistics and categorical analysis of T1 Gd-enhancing lesions by visit. 
Patients in the OCR group showed fewer new and/or enlarging T2 lesions when compared with those in 
the IFN group from as early as Week 24 (41.1% relative reduction) followed by substantial reduction of 
new  inflammation  through  Weeks  48  and  96  (relative  reductions  of  93.9%  and  98.3%  respectively). 
This reduction was seen in all numerical categories of lesions as shown in the summary of descriptive 
statistics and categorical analysis of new and/or enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions by visit. 
A greater reduction of 12-week CDP was observed for ocrelizumab versus interferon beta-1a across all 
subgroups. The subgroup of patients with baseline weight < 75 kg showed a greater reduction of 12-
week  CDP  on  ocrelizumab  versus  interferon  beta-1a  (HR  0.36  [95%  CI:  0.18,  0.72],  p  =  0.0042) 
compared with patients with baseline weight ≥ 75kg (HR 0.85 [95% CI: 0.46, 1.56], p = 0.6005). A 
similar  difference  was  observed  between  the  BMI  subgroups.  No  notable  differences  were  observed 
between the other subgroups. 
In general a greater reduction of 24-week CDP on ocrelizumab compared with interferon beta-1a was 
observed across subgroups. The subgroup of patients with baseline weight < 75 kg showed a greater 
reduction of 24-week CDP on ocrelizumab versus interferon beta-1a (HR 0.29 [95% CI: 0.13, 0.65], p 
=  0.0028)  whereas  for  patients  with  baseline  weight  ≥  75kg  there  was  no  difference  between

treatment  groups  (HR  1.01  [95%  CI:  0.50,  2.06],  p  =  0.9695).  A  similar  difference  was  observed 
between the BMI subgroups. No notable differences were observed between the other subgroups.  
Most  secondary  endpoints  were  met  following  a  hierarchical  statistical  significance  testing,  including 
the pooled analyses of CDP 12 Weeks, CDP 24 Weeks and CDI 12 weeks and all but one study specific 
MRI endpoint (Brain volume). The study in itself also had statistically significant outcomes for CDP 12 
Weeks and CDP 24 Weeks, but not for CDI 12 weeks. Missingness for CDP 12 Weeks, CDP 24 Weeks 
and CDI 12 Weeks was handled appropriately, and with positive results, with a conservative definition 
of  non-CDI  for  subjects  who  withdrew  prematurely  and  appropriate  imputation  assumptions  in  the 
sensitivity  analyses  for  CDP  12  Weeks  and  CDP  24  Weeks.  The  positive  changes  seen  for  CDP  12 
Weeks and CDP 24 Weeks are regarded as clinically relevant in terms of effect size. Step. no. 6 in the 
hierarchical testing chain,  change in  MSFC, did not show any statistically significant difference versus 
the active control and the subsequent hierarchical testing was therefore broken and non-confirmatory 
for Brain volume and NEDA (Brain volume, p=0.0042; SF-36 PCS, p=0.2193; NEDA, p<0.0001). Still, 
the  results  for  change  in  Brain  volume  (from  Week  24,  but  also  from  baseline  in  a  pre-specified 
explorative analysis) and NEDA are encouraging.

• 
Participant flow  
A  total  of  1045  patients  were  screened  for  entry  into  the  study.  Of  these,  210  patients  failed 
screening;  the  main  reasons  were  failure  to  meet  the  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  or  unacceptable 
laboratory  values  (the  number  of  screen  failures is an  estimate  based on  information  collected in  the 
IxRS). A total of 835 patients were enrolled in the study and were randomized 1:1 to interferon beta-
1a  (IFN,  N  =  418)  or  ocrelizumab  (OCR,  N  =  417).  In  total,  680  patients  (81%)  received  treatment 
and  completed  the  double-blind  treatment  period  up  to  Week  96.The  proportion  of  patients  who 
received treatment and completed the double-blind treatment period up to Week 96 was higher in the 
OCR group (86%) than in the IFN group (77%).  The difference in withdrawal from treatment between 
groups  was  mainly  due  to  higher  incidences  of  withdrawals  due  to  adverse  events  (6%  versus  4%), 
withdrawal  by  subject  (6%  versus  3%)  and lack  of  efficacy  (4%  versus  1%)  in  the  IFN  group  versus 
the OCR group, respectively.

Baseline data 
The demographic characteristics of the ITT population were well balanced across the treatment groups. 
The majority of patients were female (65% - 67% across treatment groups) and were predominantly 
white  (88%  -  91%  across  treatment  groups)  with  median  ages  of  37  and  38  years  in  the  treatment 
groups  (range  18  -  55  years).  Patients’  median  weight  was  approximately  73  -  74  kg  across  groups 
(range  38.0  -  163.6  kg).  Patients  were  mainly  from  Europe  (EU,  Switzerland  and  Norway; 
approximately 44% - 45% across treatment groups) or North America (USA and Canada) and Australia 
(approximately  37%  -  38%  across  treatment  groups).  The  two  treatment  groups  had  similar  MS 
disease histories. The median duration since symptom onset was 5.07 years in the IFN group and 5.16 
years  in  the  OCR  group.  Approximately  half  of  patients  (49%  -  53%  in  each  group)  had  been 
diagnosed  within  2  years  prior  to  randomization.  Almost  all  patients  (96%  in  both  treatment  groups) 
had  experienced  at  least  one  relapse  within  1  year  prior  to  randomization.  The  baseline  MRI  disease 
characteristics  of  patients  were  well  balanced  between  the  treatment  groups.  The  proportion  of 
patients  with  one  or  more  T1  Gd-enhancing  lesions  was  41%  in  the  IFN  group  and  39%  in  the  OCR 
group.  The  number  of  T1  hypointense  lesions,  volume  of  T2  hyperintense  lesions,  and  number  of  T2 
hyperintense  lesions  were  similar  between  the  groups.  In  both  groups,  92%  of  patients  had  >  9  T2 
hyperintense  lesions  at  baseline.  Median  normalized  brain  volume  was  also  similar  between  the  two 
groups  
A total of 75% of patients in the IFN group and 73% of patients in the OCR group had not been treated 
with  any  MS  medication  in  the  2  years  prior  to  randomization.  The  number  of  patients  who  had 
received  prior  MS  therapies  was  relatively  balanced  between  treatment  groups.  The  most  common 
prior  treatments  for  MS  were  glatiramer  acetate  and  interferons.  There  were  no  imbalances  in  the 
number of patients treated with a given medication.

Numbers analysed 
All 835 patients randomized to treatment were included in the ITT population. 
• Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy variable 
The  study  met  its  primary  endpoint:  treatment  with  ocrelizumab  significantly  reduced  the  ARR  by 
46.8%  (p<0.0001)  at  96  weeks  compared  with  interferon  beta-1a  (p<0.0001).    Highly  consistent 
estimates  of  treatment  effect  were  observed  in  all  pre-specified  sensitivity  analyses  of  the  primary 
endpoint. 
Patients  receiving  ocrelizumab  consistently  showed  a  greater  reduction  of  ARR  compared  with 
interferon  beta-1a  across all  subgroups.  Patients  aged  <  40  years  had  a greater  reduction  of  ARR on 
ocrelizumab versus interferon beta-1a (adjusted ARR ratio 0.403 [95% CI: 0.271, 0.600], p<0.0001) 
compared  with  patients  aged  >  40  years  (adjusted  ARR  ratio  0.807  [95%  CI:  0.523,  1.245],  p  = 
0.3335).  Patients  with  ≥  1  T1  Gd-enhancing  lesion  at  baseline  had  a  greater  reduction  of  ARR  on 
ocrelizumab versus interferon beta-1a (adjusted ARR ratio 0.422 [95% CI: 0.267, 0.668],p = 0.0002) 
compared with patients with no T1 Gd-enhancing lesions (ARR ratio 0.684 [95% CI: 0.465, 1.006], p 
=  0.0527).  However,  both  age  groups,  and  both  patients  with  or  without  baseline  Gd-enhancing 
lesions, still showed a reduction of ARR on ocrelizumab compared with interferon beta-1a. No notable 
differences were observed between the other subgroups. 
Secondary efficacy variables 
Results  of  several  secondary  endpoints  supported  the  primary  endpoint,  demonstrating  statistically 
significant  efficacy  of  ocrelizumab  when  compared  with  interferon beta-1a.    Treatment  with 
ocrelizumab  resulted  in  significantly  greater  improvements  in  measures  of  disability  compared  with 
interferon beta-1a, namely:

-A  40%  risk  reduction  in  12-week  CDP  in  the  pooled  analysis  of  Studies  WA21092  and  WA21093 
(hazard  ratio  [HR]  0.60  [95%  CI:  0.45,  0.81],  p=0.0006).  The  individual  study  also  demonstrated  a 
37% risk reduction of 12-week CDP (HR 0.63 [95% CI: 0.42, 0.92], p = 0.0169). 
-A 40% risk reduction in 24-week CDP in the pooled analysis of Studies WA21092 and WA21093 (HR 
0.60 [95% CI: 0.43, 0.84], p=0.0025). The individual study also demonstrated a 37% risk reduction of 
24-week CDP (HR 0.63 [95% CI: 0.40, 0.98], p = 0.0370). 
-A  33%  relative  increase  in  the  proportion  of  patients  with  12-week  CDI  in  the  pooled  analysis  of 
Studies  WA21092  and  WA21093  (relative  risk  [RR]  1.33  [95%  CI:  1.05,  1.68],  p=0.0194).  In  this 
study a 14% relative increase in the proportion of patients with 12-week CDI was observed (RR 1.14 
[95% CI: 0.84, 1.56], p = 0.4019). 
-An improvement of 0.107 [95% CI: 0.034, 0.180] in the MSFC score change from baseline to Week 
96 (p = 0.0040). 
Treatment  with  ocrelizumab  consistently  resulted  in  significantly  greater  effects  on  the  following  MRI 
measures compared with interferon beta-1a:  
-A 94.9% relative reduction in the total number of T1-Gd enhancing lesions (p<0.0001).  
-An 82.9% relative reduction in the total number of new and/or enlarging T2 lesions (p<0.0001). 
-A 64.3% relative reduction in the total number of new T1-hypointense lesions (p<0.0001). 
Ocrelizumab also showed statistically significant r outcomes in additional secondary efficacy endpoints 
compared  with  interferon  beta-1a,  which  were  not  formally  adjusted  for  multiplicity  and  not  formally 
statistically significant due to the hierarchichal testing strategy: 
-Greater  improvement  of  1.159  (95%  CI:  0.051,  2.268)  in  SF-36  PCS  mean  score  from  baseline  to 
Week 96 (non-confirmatory p = 0.0404).  
-A 81% relative increase in the proportion of patients with NEDA (non-confirmatory p<0.0001). 
Ocrelizumab  showed  a  numerically  superior  but  not  statistically  significant  outcome  in  the  remaining 
secondary endpoint compared to interferon beta-1a: 
-A 14.9% relative reduction in mean percent brain volume loss from Week 24 to Week 96 (p=0.0900)

A hierarchical approach was taken for significance testing in order to control for multiplicity. CDP and 
CDI endpoints were analyzed in a pooled population of Studies WA21092 and WA21093 due to a lack 
of  power  and  these  were  the  results  used  in  the  hierarchy.    A  summary  of  all  p-values  within  the 
hierarchical  structure  is  provided  in  the  Table  21  below  and  indicates  those  values  which  should  be 
considered  non-confirmatory  since  they  follow  a  non-significant  test  result  within  the  hierarchy 
structure  (shaded  cells).    Importantly,  the  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  showing  efficacy  of 
ocrelizumab on both clinical and imaging measures of inflammation (ARR, T1 Gd-enhancing lesions and 
new  and/or  enlarging  T2  lesions)  and  on  clinical  measures  of  disease  progression  (CDP,  new  T1 
hypointense lesions) were all met.

Patients  in  the  OCR  group  showed  fewer  T1  Gd-enhancing  lesions  when  compared  with  those  in  the 
IFN  group  from  as  early  as  Week  24  (92.3%  reduction)  with  greater  suppression  of  inflammatory 
lesions  at  subsequent  visits  (relative  reductions  of  95.6%  and  97.2%  at  Weeks  48  and  96 
respectively). This reduction was seen in all numerical categories of lesions as shown in the summary 
of descriptive statistics and categorical analysis of T1 Gd-enhancing lesions by visit. 
Patients in the OCR group showed fewer new and/or enlarging T2 lesions when compared with those in 
the IFN group from as early as Week 24 (60.7% relative reduction) followed by substantial reduction of 
new  inflammation  through  Weeks  48  and  96  (relative  reductions  of  95.6%  and  96.9%  respectively). 
This reduction was seen in all numerical categories of lesions as shown in the summary of descriptive

A greater reduction of 12-week CDP was observed for ocrelizumab versus interferon beta-1a across all 
subgroups  (Figure  7).  The  subgroup  of  patients  with  baseline  weight  <  75  kg  showed  a  greater 
reduction of 12-week CDP on ocrelizumab versus interferon beta-1a (HR 0.43 [95% CI: 0.24, 0.79], p 
=  0.0058)  compared  with  patients  with  baseline  weight  ≥  75kg  (HR  0.90  [95%  CI:  0.53,  1.53],  p  = 
0.6976). No notable differences were observed between the other subgroups. 
In general a greater reduction of 24-week CDP on ocrelizumab compared with interferon beta-1a was 
observed across subgroups (Figure 9). The subgroup of patients with baseline weight < 75 kg showed 
a greater reduction of 24-week CDP on ocrelizumab versus interferon beta-1a (HR 0.37 [95% CI: 0.19, 
0.73], p = 0.0042) than those patients with baseline weight ≥ 75kg (versus HR 1.06 [95% CI: 0.56,

differences were observed between the other subgroups. 
Study WA25046 (main study in PPMS) 
Clinical  study  WA25046,  hereafter  also  referred  to  as  Study  25046.  Study  title:  A  Phase  III, 
multicenter,  randomized,  parallel-group,  double  blinded,  placebo  controlled  study  to  evaluate  the 
efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab in adults with primary progressive multiple sclerosis.  
Methods 
This study was a randomized double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled phase III study, designed 
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab in adults with primary progressive multiple sclerosis 
(PPMS). The study consisted of the following periods: 
•  Screening 
•  Double-blind treatment 
•  Safety follow-up (SFU) followed by B-cell monitoring 
•  Open  label  extension  (OLE);  at  the  time  of  the  clinical  cut-off  date,  the  OLE  had  not  started  and 
hence is not included in this report. 
Consenting patients were screened within 4 weeks prior to the start of the study. Eligible patients were 
then randomized. Treatment was administered in a double-blind fashion for a minimum of 5 treatment 
doses, each of 24 weeks duration. Additional treatment doses were to take place until the last enrolled 
patient  reached  120  weeks  of  treatment  and  the  planned  total  number  of  253  confirmed  disability 
progression  events  had  occurred.  No  study  treatment  was  administered  during  SFU  or  B-cell 
monitoring. 
Two infusion visits occurred 14 days apart every 24 weeks until the end of the double-blind treatment 
period (i.e. Day 1 and Week 2, Weeks 24 and 26, Weeks 48 and 50, and so forth). Non-infusion visits 
occurred  at  Week  12  and  at  the  midpoint  of  each  treatment  dose  thereafter  through  the  end  of  the 
double-blind  treatment  period  (i.e.  Weeks  36,  60,  84,  and  so  forth).  In  addition,  a  structured 
telephone  interview  was  performed  on  an  every  4-week  basis  between  study  visits  from  Week  8 
through  the  end  of  the  double-blind  treatment  period  to  identify  any  new  or  worsening  neurological 
symptoms that warranted an unscheduled visit. 
Neurological  exams  were  collected  at  baseline  and  each  subsequent  visit  during  the  double-blind 
treatment period. EDSS and MSFC assessment were recorded at baseline, Week 12 and then every 12 
weeks.  MRI  was  collected  at  baseline,  Week  24,  Week  48,  and  Week  120.  SF-36  was  collected  at 
baseline, Week 48 and Week 120.

• 
Treatments 
For the blinded treatment period patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: 
– ocrelizumab 600 mg every 24 weeks. 
– placebo. 
Each  dose  of  ocrelizumab  600  mg/placebo  was  administered  as  two  IV  infusions  of  300  mg 
ocrelizumab/placebo given 14 days apart. The first infusion was administered on study Day 1. Patients 
were evaluated for pre-specified re-treatment criteria prior to all subsequent infusions. 
In  order  to  lower  the  risk  of  IRRs,  patients  were  administered  100  mg  IV  methylprednisolone  (or  an 
equivalent  dose  of  alternative  steroid)  approximately  30  minutes  prior  to  every  infusion.  It  was  also 
recommended  that  patients  receive  an  analgesic/antipyretic  and  an  antihistamine.  Patients  remained 
under observation for at least 1 hour after the completion of each infusion. 
Ocrelizumab/placebo  was  administered  on  an  outpatient  basis,  in  a  hospital  or  clinic  environment 
under  close  supervision  of  an  investigator  or  a  medically  qualified  staff.  A  minimum  interval  of  20 
weeks  was  kept  between  the  last  infusion  of  one  treatment  dose  and  the  first  infusion  of  the  next 
treatment dose of ocrelizumab/placebo, e.g., Dose 1 (infusion Week 2) and the next infusion of Dose 2 
(infusion Week 24). 
• 
Objectives 
Primary Objective 
To investigate the efficacy of ocrelizumab compared with placebo in patients with primary progressive 
multiple sclerosis (PPMS). The primary endpoint was the time to onset of clinical disability progression 
(CDP) over the treatment period, defined as an increase in the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) 
score that was sustained for at least 12 weeks (based on regularly scheduled visits).  
Secondary Objectives 
Assessment report

     Page 78/180 
 
 
 
 
To  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  ocrelizumab  compared  with  placebo,  as  reflected  by  the 
following: 
• The time to onset of CDP over the treatment period, defined as an increase in EDSS that is sustained 
for at least 24 weeks (based on regularly scheduled visits) 
• The change in timed 25-foot walk (T25-FW) from baseline to Week 120 
• The change in total volume of T2 hyperintense lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 
the brain from baseline to Week 120 
• The percentage change in total brain volume as detected by brain MRI from Week 24 to Week 120 
•  The  change  in  Short  Form  36  (SF-36)  Health  Survey  version  2  (SF  36v2)  Physical  Component 
Summary (PCS) score from baseline to Week 120 
• The safety and tolerability of ocrelizumab 300 mg × 2 (administered every 24 weeks) compared with 
placebo in patients with PPMS 
• 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy variable 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  time  to  onset  of  CDP  for  at  least  12  weeks  (12-week  CDP) 
during the double-blind treatment period. 
The  time  to  onset  of  CDP  was  defined  as  the  time  from  baseline  to  the  first  disability  progression, 
which  is  confirmed  at  the  next  regularly  scheduled  visit  ≥  12  weeks  (  ≥  84  days)  after  the  initial 
disability progression. Baseline for the time to onset of CDP is the date of randomization, independent 
of the first day of dosing. Disability progression is defined as an increase of ≥ 1.0 point from baseline 
EDSS score, if the baseline EDSS value is ≤ 5.5 points (inclusive), or an increase of ≥ 0.5 points, if the 
baseline  EDSS  is  >  5.5  points.  Assessments  within 30  days  after  a  protocol-defined  relapse  were  not 
used for confirmation of disability progression. The initial disability progression had to occur when the 
patient  was  still  on  treatment.  Non-confirmatory  EDSS  assessments  (if  any)  between  the  initial  and 
confirmation of disability progression had to fulfill the requirements for progression 
There  is  evidence  of  higher  EDSS  confirmation  rates  in  progressive  versus  relapsing  MS  with 
confirmation rates in progressive patients for 12-week CDP of approximately 80% [Ebers et al. 2008]. 
A  PPMS  patient  who  experiences  initial  disease  progression  (IDP)  has  an  increased  risk  of  disability 
progression compared to other patients without an initial event who are still ongoing in the treatment 
period. Patients who had an IDP and then discontinued the treatment early with no confirmatory EDSS 
assessments were, therefore, not censored as this would introduce substantial bias. This IDP was used 
as an event and these events are subsequently referred to as imputed events. 
Patients who had initial disability progression with no confirmatory EDSS assessment and who were on 
treatment at time of CCOD were censored at the date of their last EDSS assessment. Patients who did 
not have initial disability progression at time of CCOD, time of early discontinuation, or loss to follow 
up were censored at the date of their last EDSS assessment that occurred during the treatment period. 
The time to CDP for the ocrelizumab and the placebo groups was compared using a two-sided log-rank 
test stratifying by geographic region (US versus ROW) and age (≤ 45 versus >45). The proportion of 
patients  with  confirmed  disability  progression  was  estimated  using  Kaplan-Meier  methodology.  The 
overall hazard ratio was estimated using a stratified Cox regression model with the same stratification 
factors used in the stratified log-rank test above 
Secondary efficacy variables 
Each  secondary  efficacy  endpoint  was  tested  in  the  hierarchical  order  listed  below,  if  the  primary 
endpoint and each preceding endpoint had reached the significance level of 0.05. 
- Time to onset of CDP for at least 24 weeks ( ≥ 161 days, 24-week CDP) 
-  Change in T25-FW from baseline to Week 120 
Assessment report  
EMA/790835/2017

- Change in total volume of T2 lesions from baseline to Week 120 
- Percent change in total brain volume from Week 24 to Week 120 
- Change in PCS (SF-36) from baseline to Week 120 
• 
Sample size 
The  sample  size  was  estimated on  the  basis  of  data  from  a  rituximab  Phase  II/III  trial  in  adults  with 
PPMS  (Study  U2786g).  The  two-year  progression  rate  among  patients  receiving  ocrelizumab  was 
predicted to be 30% compared with 43% among patients receiving placebo. A two group test of equal 
exponential  survival  with  exponential  dropout  was  used  to  determine  the  sample  size  for  the  time  to 
CDP. With a 2:1 randomization ratio between the ocrelizumab and placebo groups and the assumption 
of a one-year accrual period with a 3.5 year maximum treatment period, the total sample size of 630 
patients  provides  approximately  80%  power,  maintaining  the  type  I  error  rate  of  0.01  (or 
approximately 92% power for type I error rate of 0.05), and assuming a dropout rate of 20% over 2 
years. A total of 253 disability events were required to maintain statistical power to detect the planned 
treatment difference. 
• 
Randomisation 
Eligible  patients  were  randomized  to  2  groups  in  a  2:1  ratio  via  an  independent  IxRS  provider. 
Randomization was stratified by region (United States [US] versus rest of the world [RoW]) and age (≤ 
45  versus  >45).  The  patient  Randomization  List  was  generated  by  IxRS  using  a  pre-defined 
randomization  specification.  Prior  to  unblinding,  the  randomization  list  was  not  available  at  the  study 
center,  to  the  monitors,  project  statisticians  or  to  the  Sponsor’s  project  team.  Randomized  patients 
were assigned a unique medication number and a randomization number. The IxRS provider held the 
treatment assignment codes. There was no replacement of patients who withdrew from the study after 
randomization. 
• 
Blinding (masking) 
This  was  a  double-blind  study.  The  Sponsor  remained  blinded  until  the  database  lock  (DBL)  for  the 
primary analysis. The study sites remained blinded until patients switched to OLE, which occurred after 
the  primary  analysis  was  completed.  Patients  continued  on  their  original  assignments  in  a  blinded 
fashion until the determination of primary efficacy could be made and patients transitioned to OLE. 
To  prevent  potential  functional  unblinding  during  the  double-blind  treatment  period,  the  following 
additional measures were implemented: 
- Dedicated role of the examining investigator / EDSS assessor who was not involved with any aspect 
of  medical  management  of  the  patient  and  did  not  have  access  to  patient  data.  The  examining 
investigator  was  a  neurologist  or  other  health  care  practitioner  and  was  trained  and  certified  in 
administering  the  Functional  System  Scores  (FSS)  and  EDSS  prior  to  study  start.  The  examining 
investigator was responsible for the administration of the FSS/EDSS and MSFC. Whenever possible, the 
same  individual  performed  the  FSS/EDSS  examination  for  the  same  patient  during  the  full  study 
duration. 
-  Blinding  of  selected  laboratory  parameters that  could  reveal patient’s  allocation  to  study  treatment. 
Note that these laboratory parameters remained blinded to the study sites until the start of OLE, which 
occurred after the  primary analysis was completed. 
-  All  scheduled  on-study  MRI  scans  were  assessed  by  an  independent,  central  MRI  reader  who  was 
blinded  to  the  treatment  assignment.  All  scans  were  also  reviewed  locally  for  safety  by  a  radiologist 
who  was  blinded  to  the  treatment  assignment.  All  scans  were  also  reviewed  locally  for  safety  by  a 
radiologist who was blinded to treatment assignment. 
Unblinding for the ongoing safety monitoring by the iDMC, was performed according to procedures in 
place to ensure integrity of the data 
Assessment report

Unblinding  for  analysis  of  biological  samples  and  pharmacokinetic  data  analysis  was  performed 
according to procedures in place to ensure integrity of the data. 
Unblinding  of  treatment  assignment  by  the  site  could  only  occur  in  the  case  of  emergency  situations 
where  the  knowledge  of  what  study  medication  the  patient  was  receiving  was  critical  for  clinical 
management. Unblinding was performed by means of the IxRS.  
As  per  regulatory  reporting  requirements,  the  Sponsor  unblinded  the  identity  of  study  medication  for 
all unexpected serious adverse events (SAEs) that were considered by the investigator to be related to 
study drug per safety reference document(s), e.g. the Investigator’s Brochure.  
• 
Statistical methods 
The statistical methods employed for each type of endpoint are summarized in Table 22. However, the 
effects of different methods for handling missing data were tested as part of the pre-specified 
sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint.  
Experience from the RMS Phase III program and blinded review of WA25046 data indicated that the 
use of MMRM on the absolute change in T25-FW and T2 lesion volume from baseline to Week 120 
would violate assumptions of normal distribution of the residuals. Before DBL, the SAP was amended to 
pre-specify analysis of the relative change from baseline. The p-value comparing the percent change 
from baseline was based on the non-parametric ranked analysis of covariance (ranked ANCOVA) with 
the ranked percent change as the outcome variable and the ranked baseline value as the covariate, 
adjusting for geographical region (United States vs. ROW) and age (≤ 45 vs. > 45 years). The last 
observation carried forward method was used to impute missing values. Estimates of treatment effects 
were derived using MMRM analyses on the log-transformed ratio of post-baseline / baseline values 
since the ranked ANCOVA does not provide these estimates 
Each secondary efficacy endpoint was tested in the hierarchical order listed below, if the primary 
endpoint and each preceding endpoint had reached the significance level of 0.05.

Table 17 Statistical Analysis of Primary and Secondary Efficacy Endpoints (Study 
WA25046)  
The analyses of the primary endpoint of time to onset of CDP for at least 12 weeks, and the secondary 
endpoint  of  time  to  onset  of  CDP  for  at  least  24  weeks,  were  repeated  in  various  pre-specified 
sensitivity analyses as follows: 
Sensitivity Analyses of Primary Endpoint 
Pre-specified  sensitivity  analyses  of  the  primary  endpoint  time  to  onset  of  CDP  for  at  least  12  weeks 
were conducted as follows: 
- PP population 
- ITT population with multiple imputation (patients with initial disability progression who discontinued 
treatment  early  with  no  confirmatory  EDSS  assessment  were  imputed  as  having  CDP  with  50% 
probability) 
-  ITT population with censoring of the imputed events (patients with initial disability progression who 
discontinued  treatment  early  with  no  confirmatory  EDSS  assessment  were  censored  as  not  having 
CDP) 
- Influence of early progression events, by omission of EDSS assessments from randomization to Week 
12 ( ≤ 83 days after randomization) (ITT Population) 
Assessment report

- Analysis using the planned number of patients (used for study sample size calculation), i.e, using the 
first 630 patients randomized (ITT Population) 
-  Adjustment  with  additional  strata  for  baseline  presence  of  T1  Gd-enhancing  lesions  (present  / 
absent) and baseline EDSS ( ≤ 5.5 vs. > 5.5) 
- Exclusion of patients with clinical relapses (including protocol-defined relapses)  
In addition, the following post-hoc sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint were performed: 
-  Analysis  including  progression  after  treatment  discontinuation  (for  patients  who  discontinued 
treatment  early,  inclusion  of  initial  and  confirmed  disability  progression  events  occurring  after 
withdrawal  from  treatment  during  SFU  period  until  CCOD,  same  imputation  rules  as  for  primary 
analysis). 
-  Imputation  by  reason  for  withdrawal  (patients  with  initial  disability  progression  who  discontinued 
treatment  early  with  reason  for  withdrawal  “lack  of  efficacy”,  or  “withdrawal  by  subject”,  and  no 
confirmatory EDSS assessment were imputed as having CDP; other withdrawal reasons were imputed 
as not having CDP). 
-  Analysis  excluding  CDP  events  where  a  PDR  was  experienced  from  30  days  preceding  an  IDP  or 
between IDP and CDP; this sensitivity analysis explored disability progression events that were related 
to an effect on relapses. 
Sensitivity Analyses of Secondary Endpoint (Time to Onset of CDP for at least 24 weeks) 
Pre-specified sensitivity analyses of the secondary endpoint time to onset of CDP for at least 24 weeks 
were conducted as follows: 
- Influence of early progression events, by omission of EDSS assessments from randomization to Week 
12 ( ≤ 83 days after randomization) (ITT Population) 
- Exclusion of patients with clinical relapses (including protocol-defined relapses) 
In  addition,  the  following  post-hoc  sensitivity  analyses  listed  above  for  the  primary  endpoint  were 
repeated for the secondary endpoint time to onset of CDP for at least 24 weeks: 
- PP population 
- ITT population with multiple imputations 
- ITT population without imputation 
-  Analysis  including  progression  after  treatment  discontinuation  (as  described  for  the  primary 
endpoint). 
- Imputation by reason for withdrawal (as described for the primary endpoint). 
-  Analysis  excluding  CDP  events  where  a  PDR  was  experienced  from  30  days  preceding  an  IDP  or 
between IDP and CDP (as described for the primary endpoint) 
The primary and the following secondary efficacy endpoints (defined in the SAP: time to onset of 12- 
and  24-week  CDP,  change  in  T25-FW  from  baseline to  Week  120,  and  changes  in  total  volume of  T2 
lesions;  defined  post-hoc:  percent  change  in  total  brain  volume  from  Week  24  to  Week  120)  were 
summarized and analyzed by predefined subgroups: 
- Age (≤ 45 vs. >45 years) 
- Sex (male patients vs. female patients) 
- Baseline EDSS (≤ 5.5 vs. > 5.5) 
- Region (United States vs. ROW) 
- Presence or absence of gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions at baseline MRI scan

- Prior MS disease-modifying therapies, with the exception of corticosteroids (yes vs. no) 
- Duration since MS symptom onset (≤ 3 years, 3 to ≤ 5 years, 5 to ≤ 10 years, > 10 years) 
- Weight (≤ 75 vs. > 75 kg at baseline) 
- Body mass index (< 25 vs. ≥ 25 kg/m2, at baseline) 
The following exploratory efficacy endpoints were defined in the SAP: 
-  MRI-derived  parameters:  number  of  gadolinium-enhancing  T1  lesions  and  number  of  new  or 
enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions 
- Cognitive impairment: change from baseline to Week 120 in the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test 
(PASAT) 
-  Percent  change  from  baseline  to  Week  120  in  total  and  cortical  gray  matter  brain  volume  and  the 
percent change from Week 24 to Week 120 in gray matter brain volume 
- Proportion of patients with CDP at Week 120 
- Functional impairment: change from baseline to Weeks 48, 96, and 120 in EDSS score (mean change 
and area under the curve), and change from baseline to Weeks 48, 96, and 120 in MSFC. 
-  The  change  in  fatigue,  as  measured  by  the  MFIS  total  score  and  subscale  scores  (physical  impact, 
cognitive impact, and psychological impact) from baseline to Week 120. 
- The change in quality of life, as measured by the SF-36v2 MCS score from baseline to Week 120 
- Time to confirmed composite disability progression over the treatment period, defined as an increase 
in  EDSS  that  is  sustained  for  at  least  12  weeks  (0.5  or  1,  same  criteria  as  for  the  primary  endpoint 
time to 12-week CDP) or a 20% increase in 25-foot timed walk that is sustained for at least 12 weeks 
or a 20% increase in 9-hole peg test that is sustained for at least 12 weeks. 
Other  exploratory  efficacy  endpoints  not  defined  as  pre-planned  exploratory  endpoints  in  the  SAP, 
were as follows: 
- The time to sustained 20% increase in T25-FW and 9-hole peg test. 
- The proportion of patients with a 20% increase in T25-FW time. 
- The proportion of patients with a 20% increase in 9-hole peg test time. 
- The change from baseline in total non-enhancing T1 lesion volume. 
-  The  percentage  change  in  white  matter  volume  from  baseline  to  Week  120  and  from  Week  24  to 
Week 120. 
Results  
• 
Participant flow  
A total of 943 patients were screened for entry into the study. Of these, 211 patients failed screening 
(note, 252 patients initially failed screening of which 55 patients were re-screened and 41 of these re-
screened  patients  were  eligible  for  entry  into  the  study);  the  main  reasons  were  failure  to  meet  the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, (e.g. unacceptable laboratory values), and withdrawal of consent.  
A  total  of  732  patients  were  randomized  into  the  study,  of  which  725  received  at  least  one  dose  of 
placebo or ocrelizumab. Patients were randomized in a ratio of 2:1 (ocrelizumab:placebo), stratified by 
age ( ≤ 45 vs > 45 years) and region (US vs ROW). Of the 732 patients randomized (ITT population: 
placebo 244 patients vs OCR 488 patients), 725 patients received treatment (placebo 243 patients vs 
OCR 482 patients); 1 patient assigned to the placebo group and 6 patients assigned to the ocrelizumab 
group  withdrew  before  receiving  treatment  (Figure  2).  A  total  of  549  patients  (placebo  162  patients,

66%,  vs  OCR  387  patients,  79%)  were  ongoing  with  double-blind  treatment  at  the  CCOD.  Based  on 
the  ITT  population,  a  total  of  183 patients  (placebo 82  patients  [34%],  OCR  101  patients  [21%]  had 
withdrawn at the time of the CCOD (including those withdrawn before dosing), 106 of which (placebo: 
45 patients [55% of those withdrawn] vs OCR 61 patients [60% of those withdrawn]) had entered SFU 
(see Figure 10 for a summary of patient disposition). 
Figure 10 Overview of Patient Disposition (All Patients) 
Based  on  the  ITT  population,  a  total  of  183  patients  (25%),  including  7  patients  who  did  not  receive 
treatment,  withdrew  from  the  double-blind  treatment  period.  The  reasons  for  withdrawal  of  patients 
prior  to  dosing  included  patients  that  were  randomized  by  error  that  had  failed  screening,  abnormal 
ECG  reading  at  baseline,  and  withdrawal  of  consent  after  randomization.  A  higher  proportion  of 
patients  in  the  placebo  group  (34%)  withdrew  prematurely  from  treatment  during  the  double-blind 
treatment  period  compared  to  the  OCR  group  (21%).  The  difference  was  mainly  due  to  higher 
incidences  of  withdrawals  due  to  lack  of  efficacy  (11%  versus  4%)  and  withdrawal  by  subject  (9% 
versus  5%)  in  the  placebo  group  versus  the  OCR  group,  respectively.  Withdrawal  rates  were 
approximately constant in both the placebo and ocrelizumab groups throughout the treatment period.

Recruitment 
This was a multicenter study with in total 182 centers in 29 countries (Europe, North America, Israel, 
New Zealand, Peru and Mexico). The first patient randomised was in March 2011 and the clinical cut-
off for the primary analysis was in July 2015. 
• 
Conduct of the study 
The  study  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  principles  of  the  “Declaration  of  Helsinki”  and  Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP). Four protocol amendments were issued, one of these included:

Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics of the ITT population were well balanced between groups. Consistent with 
the epidemiology of MS, the majority of the patients were white (>90% in both groups), with a median 
age of 46 years (range 18-56 years). Consistent with the sex prevalence for PPMS, approximately half 
of  the  patients  were  male  in  both  groups  (51%  in  the  ocrelizumab  group  and  49%  in  the  placebo 
group).  Patients’  median weight  was  71  kg  in  the ocrelizumab  group  and  72 kg  in  the  placebo  group 
(range  40  -  136  kg  across  both  groups).  Patients  were  mainly  from  Europe  (EU,  Switzerland  and 
Norway;  approximately  64%  across  both  groups)  or  North  America  (USA  and  Canada),  Australia  and 
New Zealand (approximately 20% in each group). Baseline disease characteristics for MS were similar 
across  both  treatment groups.  The  median  duration  of  disease in  terms  of  time  from  symptom onset 
was almost 6 years in both groups with a median time since diagnosis of 1.3 years (placebo) and 1.6 
years (OCR).  The majority of patients (placebo 88% vs OCR 89%) had not received any MS disease-
modifying  treatment  prior  to  baseline  in the  previous  2  years.  The  mean  EDSS  score  at  baseline  was 
4.7 (SD 1.2) for both groups. There were no imbalances between the treatment groups in Kurtzke FS 
scores,  nor  in  the  MSFC  total  and  component  scores  (T25-FW,  9-hole  peg  test  and  PASAT).  Baseline 
MRI assessments showed that the majority of patients had no T1 Gd-enhancing lesions (placebo 75% 
vs  OCR  73%).  The  volume  and  number  of  T2  lesions  were  similar  between  the  groups.  Normalized 
brain volume was also similar between the two groups. 
A  total  of 88%  of  patients  in  the  placebo  group  and  89% of  patients in  the  OCR  group  had  not been 
treated with any MS disease modifying treatments in the 2 years prior to randomization. The number 
of  patients  who  had  received  previous  MS  disease  modifying  therapies  in  the  prior  2  years  was 
balanced between treatment groups (12% in the placebo group and 11% in the OCR group). The most 
common prior MS disease modifying treatments were interferons and glatiramer acetate.

• Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy variable 
Treatment with ocrelizumab led to a 24% reduction in the risk of 12-week CDP compared with placebo 
(hazard ratio 0.76 [95% CI: 0.59, 0.98], p=0.0321).  
The  Kaplan-Meier  survival  curves  for  time  to  onset  of  12-week  CDP  show  separation  from  12  weeks, 
with  a  lower  proportion  of  patients  in  the  ocrelizumab  group  with  CDP  throughout  the  treatment 
period.

Figure  11  Kaplan-Meier  Plot  of  Time  to  Onset  of  Confirmed  Disability  Progression 
for at Least 12 Weeks during the Double-Blind Treatment Period (with Imputation, 
ITT population) 
The  robustness  of  the  results  of  the  primary  endpoint  was  analyzed  by  performing  various  sensitivity 
analyses  the  results  of  which  were  consistent  with  the  primary  analysis  (treatment  effect  favouring 
ocrelizumab  in  each  analysis).  With  regard  to  imputation  of  initial  disability  progression  events  for 
patients  with  early  treatment  discontinuation,  the  approach  of  ignoring  these  events  resulted  in  a 
reduced  treatment  effect  (HR  0.82  [95%  CI:  0.63,  1.07],  p=0.1477).  However,  multiple  imputation 
(HR 0.78 [95% CI: 0.60, 1.02]) and imputation by efficacy related reason for withdrawal / withdrawal 
by  subject  (HR  0.77  [95%  CI:  0.60,  1.00],  p=0.0490)  resulted  in  consistent  estimates  of  the 
treatment effect. 
The  sensitivity  analysis  including  progression  events  after  treatment  discontinuation  resulted  in  a 
reduced  treatment  effect  (HR  0.80  [95%  CI:  0.62,  1.02],  p=0.0736).  Of  note  of  the  6  additional 
progression  events  observed  during  the  SFU  of  patients  originally  randomized  to  OCR,  5  events 
occurred more than 9 months after the last infusion (see summary and listing). 
The sensitivity analysis removing progression events preceded by a PDR resulted in  similar treatment 
effect to that seen in the primary analysis (HR 0.78 [95% CI: 0.60, 1.01], p=0.0561), suggesting the 
efficacy of ocrelizumab in delaying disability progression is not due to an effect on relapses. 
The  treatment  effect  of  ocrelizumab  on  the  primary  endpoint  of  time  to  onset  of  12-week  CDP  was 
explored in subgroups including age, sex, region, BMI, body weight, baseline EDSS, presence of T1 Gd-
enhancing  lesions  at  baseline,  prior  MS  DMT,  and  duration  of  MS  symptom  onset.  There  was  a 
directionally  consistent  treatment  effect  favoring  ocrelizumab  in  all  subgroups  (HR  <1).  None  of  the 
observed differences in the size of the treatment effect between subgroups were statistically significant 
(interaction  p>0.05)  and  were  potentially  due  to  the  expected  variation.  Note,  the  study  was  not 
powered  to  demonstrate  efficacy  differences  between  these  subgroups.  Numerical  differences  in 
treatment  effect  were  observed  within  some  subgroups  including  sex,  baseline  T1  Gd-enhancing 
lesions, and age. Subgroup interaction p-values below 0.2 were considered a trend; between 0.2 and 
0.3  were  considered  a  weak  trend.  Male  patients  showed  a  greater  reduction  in  12-week  CDP  in  the 
OCR versus placebo groups (HR 0.61 [95% CI 0.43, 0.88], p = 0.0071) compared with female patients

(HR  0.94  [95%  CI  0.66,  1.36];  p  =  0.7573;  interaction  p  =  0.0962).  Patients  with  T1  Gd-enhancing 
lesions at baseline had a greater reduction in 12-week CDP in the OCR versus placebo groups (HR 0.65 
[95% CI 0.40, 1.06], p = 0.0826) compared to patients without T1 Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline 
(HR 0.84 [95% CI 0.62, 1.13];p = 0.2441; interaction p = 0.2076). In addition, patients ≤ 45 years of 
age  showed  greater  reduction  in  12-week  CDP  in  the  OCR  versus  placebo  groups  (HR  0.64  [95%  CI 
0.45, 0.92]; p = 0.0170) compared to patients > 45 years of age (HR 0.88 [95% CI 0.62, 1.26]; p = 
0.4937;  interaction  p  =  0.2278).  Post  hoc  analyses  suggests  that  younger  patients  with  T1  Gd-
enhancing lesions at baseline have a better treatment effect [≤ 45 years: HR 0.52 (0.27-1.00); ≤ 46 
years (median age of the WA25046 study); HR 0.48 (0.25-0.92); <51 years: HR 0.53 (0.31-0.89)].   
Secondary efficacy variables 
The  consistent  results  of  the  secondary  endpoints  for  disability  (24-week  CDP  and  T25-FW)  and  MRI 
(T2  lesion  volume  and  total  brain  volume)  outcomes  supported  the  primary  endpoint,  demonstrating 
statistically  significant  efficacy  of  ocrelizumab  when  compared  with  placebo.    Patients  in  the 
ocrelizumab  group  experienced  less  worsening  on  the  secondary  endpoint  of  SF-36  PCS  score 
compared with placebo, but this difference was not statistically significant.

The  robustness  of  the  results  of  the  secondary  endpoint  24-week  CDP  was  analyzed  by  performing 
various  sensitivity  analyses.  The  sensitivity  analyses  were  consistent  with  the  primary  analysis 
(treatment  effect  favoring  ocrelizumab  in  each  analysis).  Regarding  the  imputation  of  initial  disability 
progression  events  for  patients  with  early  treatment  discontinuation,  the  approach  of  ignoring  these 
events  resulted  in  a  reduced  treatment  effect  (HR  0.82  [95%  CI:  0.62,  1.10],  p=0.1884).  However, 
multiple  imputation  (HR  0.78  [95%  CI:  0.59,  1.04])  and  imputation  by  efficacy  related  reason  for 
withdrawal / withdrawal by subject (HR 0.76 [95% CI: 0.58, 1.00], p = 0.0493) resulted in consistent 
estimates  of  treatment  effect.  The  sensitivity  analysis  including  progression  events  after  treatment

discontinuation  resulted  in  a  reduced  treatment  effect  (HR  0.79  [95%  CI:  0.60,  1.03],  p=0.0745). 
However, all 6 additional progression events observed during the SFU of patients originally randomized 
to OCR occurred more than 9 months. The sensitivity analysis removing progression events preceded 
by a PDR resulted in a similar treatment effect to that seen in the primary analysis (HR 0.78 [95% CI: 
0.59, 1.02], p=0.0705), suggesting the efficacy of ocrelizumab in delaying disability progression is not 
due to an effect on relapses. 
The treatment effect of ocrelizumab on the secondary endpoint of time to onset of 24-week CDP was 
explored  in  the  same  subgroups  as  for  the  primary  endpoint.  Consistent  with  the  results  of  the 
subgroup  analysis  for  the  primary  endpoint,  there  was  a  directionally  consistent  treatment  effect 
favoring  ocrelizumab  in  all  subgroups  (HR  <1).  None  of  the  observed  differences  in  the  size  of  the 
treatment  effect  between  subgroups  were  statistically  significant  (interaction  p>0.05)  and  were

differences  between  these  subgroups.  Consistent  with  the  primary  endpoint,  numerical  differences  in 
treatment effect were observed within some subgroups including sex and age. Subgroup interaction p-
values  below  0.2  were  considered  a  trend;  between  0.2  and  0.3  were  considered  a  weak  trend. 
Patients  ≤  45  years  of  age  showed  a  greater  reduction  in  24-week  CDP  in  the  OCR  versus  placebo 
groups (HR 0.61 [95% CI 0.42, 0.90], p = 0.0114) compared with patients > 45 years of age (HR 0.92 
[95% CI 0.63, 1.34], p = 0.6478; interaction p = 0.1558). Male patients showed a greater reduction in 
24-week CDP in the OCR versus placebo groups (HR 0.64 [95% CI 0.44, 0.93], p = 0.0184) compared 
with  female  patients  (HR  0.89  [95%  CI  0.61,  1.31];  p  =  0.5632;  interaction  p  =  0.2091).  No 
difference in the risk of 24-week CDP was observed between patients with or without T1 Gd-enhancing 
lesions 
Exploratory  analyses  of  time  to  disability  progression  as  measured  by  a  24-week  composite  endpoint 
(CDP by EDSS or a 20% increase in T25-FW or 20% increase in 9-hole peg test, all confirmed for 24 
weeks)  showed  a  29%  relative  reduction  with  ocrelizumab  (hazard  ratio  [95%  CI:  0.58,  0.87],  p  = 
0.0008. 
The explorative analyses for change from baseline with respect to EDSS scores, PASAT and MSFC did 
not demonstrate any statistically significant differences between the two treatment groups. 
Extended Controlled Treatment Period 
To  further  demonstrate  that  the  clinical  benefit  of  ocrelizumab  relative  to  placebo  is  sustained  with 
ongoing  treatment,  longer-term  data  taken  from  the  WA25046  extended  controlled  treatment  period 
(CCOD  of  20  January  2016)  was  analyzed.  The  extended  controlled  treatment  period  results  for  the 
key disability progression endpoints are as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
A 24% risk reduction for 12-week CDP (p=0.0151) 
A 30% risk reduction for 24-week CDP (p=0.0056) 
A  28%  risk  reduction  for  12-week  composite  CDP  (EDSS  or  T25-FW  or  9-hole  peg  test) 
(p=0.0005) 
A  32%  risk  reduction  for  24-week  composite  CDP  (EDSS  or  T25-FW  or  9-hole  peg  test) 
(p<0.0001). 
At the time of the CCOD for the primary analysis (24 July 2015) of Study WA25046, patients were still 
on  treatment  as  originally  randomized,  and  remained  blinded  to  treatment  assignment.  After  the 
CCOD, and after ascertaining that the study was positive, we initiated the open label extension (OLE). 
In  the  period  between  the  CCOD  for  the  Primary  CSR  WA25046  and  open  label  extension  (OLE) 
initiation, the Sponsor, sites, and patients were sequentially unblinded.  
The Sponsor was unblinded on 22 September 2015. Following Sponsor unblinding, the sites remained 
blinded  to  treatment  assignment  until  12  October  2015.  After  12  October  2015,  sites  were  able  to 
Assessment report  
EMA/790835/2017 
     Page 91/180 
 
 
 
 
 
make patients aware of their treatment assignment at which time patients were given the opportunity 
to transition into the OLE. Until switch to the OLE, patients continued in their allotted treatment group.  
This represents approximately 3 additional months of blinded, controlled data for all patients (24 July – 
12  Oct  2015),  and  an  additional  approximately  3  months  of  controlled  follow-up  (12  Oct  2015  –  20 
January  2016)  during  which  time  patients  were  gradually  unblinded  and  switched  into  the  OLE.  Of 
note,  by  12  Oct  2015  all  patients  were  able  to  complete  their  144-week  visit  under  fully  blinded  and 
controlled conditions. 
The  extended  controlled  treatment  period  includes  all  efficacy  data  from  the  double-blind  controlled 
treatment period plus any additional efficacy data collected during the controlled treatment period from 
the  time  of  the  Primary  CSR  CCOD  (24  July  2015)  up  to  the  CCOD  of  20 January  2016  or  up  to  the 
time at which the patient received their first open-label dose of ocrelizumab, whichever came first.  
Efficacy  results  for  CDP  12  and  24  weeks,  plus  exploratory  composite  results  from  the  extended 
controlled treatment period are presented below. 
Time to Onset of Confirmed Disability Progression Sustained for at Least 12 Weeks  
From  baseline,  256  events  (placebo  96,  ocrelizumab  160)  occurred  during  the  controlled  treatment 
period  up  to  the  CCOD  for  the  primary  analysis  (24  July  2015)  and  283  events  (placebo  106, 
ocrelizumab  177)  up  to  the  CCOD  for  the  extended  controlled  treatment  period  (20  January  2016). 
These  additional  27  events  (placebo  10,  ocrelizumab  17)  events  were  added  to  the  analysis  at  the 
latter cut and, while point estimates remained similar, the p-values were generally smaller due to the 
increase in the number of events. 
Treatment with ocrelizumab led to a 26% reduction in the risk of 12-week CDP compared with placebo 
(HR 0.74 [95% CI: 0.58, 0.95], p=0.0151; Table 20).

The Kaplan-Meier survival curves for time to onset of 12-week CDP are shown in Figure 13. The curves 
show separation from 12 weeks, with a lower proportion of patients in the ocrelizumab group with CDP 
throughout  the  treatment  period.  Of  note,  the  Kaplan-Meier  estimates  at  Week  144  and  beyond 
confirm  the  increasing  separation  between  treatment  arms  with  confidence  intervals  excluding  point 
estimates of the other arm. 
Estimates  of  absolute  risk  reduction  and  NNT  are  very  dependent  on  the  selected  timepoint.  The 
hazard  ratio  as  a  weighted  relative  risk  over  the  entire  duration  of  the  study  provides  a  more 
comprehensive summary of the overall treatment benefit. To illustrate the fluctuation of risk estimates 
over time, Table 21 and Table 22 show the absolute risk reductions and corresponding NNT numbers at 
various timepoints for the double-blind and the extended controlled treatment period for 12-week CDP 
and 24-week CDP. Treatment effect estimates decrease after Week 72 and increase again after Week 
120.  Fluctuations  in  event  rates  occur  in  both  arms  and  may  be  reflective  of  variability  in  clinical 
assessments or individual patient progression (including differences in baseline age or region that are 
not corrected for in Kaplan-Meier analysis). The increasing absolute treatment benefit after Week 120 
is  confirmed  by  the  additional  follow-up  data  collected  during  the  extended  controlled  treatment 
period.

Longer term benefit from ocrelizumab treatment was also seen in a survival analysis which  was conducted on 
12-week CDP (with imputation) excluding information until after the first EDSS assessment (18 weeks) which 
resulted  in  a  hazard  ratio  of  0.80,  suggesting  sustained  benefit  from  ocrelizumab  therapy  beyond  18  weeks 
(Table 23).  The  respective  KM  curve  (Figure 14)  shows  that  after  the  first  EDSS  assessment  the  observed 
reduction in progression risk for patients treated with ocrelizumab is starting at Week 120 and sustained to the 
end of the extended controlled treatment period.

Time to Onset of Confirmed Disability Progression Sustained for at Least 24 Weeks  
From  baseline,  231  events  (placebo  87,  ocrelizumab  144)  occurred  during  the  controlled  treatment 
period  up  to  the  CCOD  for  the  primary  analysis  (24  July  2015)  and  252  events  (placebo  98, 
ocrelizumab  154)  up  to  the  CCOD  for  the  extended  controlled  treatment  period  (20  January  2016). 
These additional 21 events (placebo 11, ocrelizumab 10) were added to the analysis at the latter cut 
and, while point estimates remained similar, the p-values were generally smaller due to the increase in 
the number of events. 
Consistent  with  the  12-week  CDP,  during  the  extended  controlled  treatment  period,  treatment  with 
ocrelizumab led to a statistically significant 30% reduction in the risk of 24-week CDP compared with 
placebo (HR 0.70 [95% CI: 0.54, 0.90], p = 0.0056)). 
The Kaplan-Meier survival curves for time to onset of 24-week CDP are shown in Figure 15. Consistent 
with the 12-week CDP, the curves show separation from 12 weeks, with a lower proportion of patients 
in the ocrelizumab group with CDP throughout the treatment period.

A survival analyses was also conducted on 24-week CDP (with imputation) excluding information until

benefit  from  ocrelizumab  therapy  beyond  18  weeks  (Table 24).  The  respective  Kaplan-Meier  curve 
(Figure 16) shows that after the first EDSS assessment the observed reduction in progression risk for 
patients  treated  with  ocrelizumab  is  starting  at  week  120  and  sustained  to  the  end  of  the  extended 
controlled treatment period.

Time to Confirmed Composite Disability Progression for at Least 12 Weeks and 24 Weeks 
For Extended Controlled Treatment Period 
In the extended controlled treatment period, new exploratory analyses of time to disability progression 
as  measured  by  a  12-week  composite  endpoint  (CDP  by  EDSS  or  a  20%  increase  in  T25-FW  or  20% 
increase  in  9-hole  peg  test,  all  confirmed  for  12  weeks)  showed  a  28%  relative  reduction  with 
ocrelizumab (HR 0.72 [95% CI: 0.60, 0.87], p = 0.0005) (Table 25). 
The  relative  contribution  of  the  three  components  of  the  composite  endpoint  was  analyzed  and  the 
significant effect seen in the composite was maintained in all components analyzed alone (Table 25).

Exploratory  analyses  of  time  to  disability  progression  as  measured  by  a  24-week  composite  endpoint 
(CDP by EDSS or a 20% increase in T25-FW or 20% increase in 9-hole peg test, all confirmed for 24 
weeks) showed a 32% relative reduction with ocrelizumab (HR 0.68 [95% CI: 0.56, 0.82], p = 0.0001) 
(see Table 26).  
The  relative  contribution  of  the  three  endpoints  to  the  composite  endpoint  was  analyzed.  Consistent 
with  the  results  observed  for  the  12-week  composite,  the  significant  effect  seen  in  the  24-week 
composite was found to be maintained in all components analyzed alone (Table 26).

CORROBORATION WITH RMS DATA 
Relapse-independent Disability progression in the RMS studies 
The WA21092/WA21093 studies enrolled patients with RMS, and therefore allowed enrollment of both 
relapsing-remitting MS and relapsing SPMS patients.  
SPMS is characterized by progressive accumulation of disability after an initial relapsing course of the 
disease. This neurological deterioration is independent from relapses although patients with SPMS can 
still experience relapses which could contribute to their disability progression. Therefore a certain level 
of disability is usually accumulated before the diagnosis of SPMS is made. 
Physician  assessment  of  whether  the  patient  was  in  the  relapsing-remitting  or  in  the  secondary 
progressive course of MS when enrolled in the RMS studies WA21092 and WA21093 was not collected 
as baseline. 
Patients who had relapse-independent confirmed disability progression (CDP and composite) during the 
conduct  of  Studies  WA21092  and  WA21093  have  been  identified  by  establishing  a  new  baseline  for 
EDSS, T25-TW, and 9-hole peg test for each patient after each relapse and requiring progression in the 
absence of relapse. Moreover, in addition to the ITT population the treatment effect of ocrelizumab was 
estimated  in  the  subgroup  matching  the  definition  of  SPMS  identified  using  the  MSBase  cohort 
(disability  progression  independent  of  relapses,  baseline  EDSS  ≥4.0  and  Pyramidal  FFS  ≥2) 
(Lorscheider et al. 2016).  
Of the patients putatively identified as SPMS patients using the 2 methods described above (1.9% to 
10.2% SPMS patients within the ITT), these analyses showed that ocrelizumab has a treatment benefit 
on relapse-independent disability progression.

Assessment  of  progression  events  independent  of  relapses  by  establishing  a  new  baseline  for  all 
assessments of disability 30 days after the onset of each protocol-defined relapse represents a rigorous 
method of accounting for any residual disability due to a relapse event. Although this was a post-hoc 
Assessment report

analysis  limited  to  the  96  weeks  double-blind  treatment  period,  the  results  show  that  ocrelizumab 
consistently  reduces  the  risk  of  progression  across  all  assessed  measures  of  disability,  including 
relapse-independent disability.  
Disability  progression  independent  of  relapses  is  a  phenomenon  common  to  both  RMS  and  PPMS 
patients.    Emerging  consensus  opinion  is  that  MS  is  a  continuous  spectrum  rather  than  consisting  of 
discrete  pheontypes,  and  disability  progression  independent  of  relapses  occurs  as  a  result  of  a 
pathophysiological process that is universally prevalent along this spectrum but which varies in degree 
depending on clinical course. Therefore, the applicant considered that the observed treatment benefit 
on progression independent of relapses in the RMS  studies was consistent with and supportive of the 
treatment benefit on progressive disease in the PPMS Phase III study WA25046. 
Additional Exploratory analysis and evidence from other trials 
A  similar  Phase  II/III  OLYMPUS  study  (rituximab)  (Figure 18)  did  not  reach  its  primary  endpoint, 
however  Hawker  et  al.  2009  proposed  the  hypothesis  that  selective  B-cell  therapy  would  be  more 
effective  in  patients  with  active  inflammation  as  measured  by  T1  Gd  enhanced  lesions  and  patients 
younger than 51 years. Benefit-risk in PPMS has not been established with rituximab. 
Below, the primary endpoint of the ORATORIO study 12-week CDP is compared with data from an age-
matched population (18-55 years at baseline) from the OLYMPUS study (Figure 19).  
Furthermore,  since  a  subgroup  of  earlier  rituximab  patients  (aged  <51  years,  with  T1  Gd  enhancing 
lesions  at  baseline)  in  OLYMPUS  is  the  group  that  derived  the  best  benefit,  an  equivalent  population 
from  ORATORIO  was  used  to  compare  and  look  for  similar  patterns  on  disability  progression 
(Figure 20;  Figure 21).  Similar  trends  showing  early  (Figure 20)  and  late  (Figure 21)  separation 
are seen with both ocrelizumab and rituximab. 
There are limitations of such comparisons including being based on post-hoc analyses, underpowered, 
different MRI methods (acquisition, reading methods), different durations of study (the OLYMPUS study 
with a fixed duration and concluding at 96 weeks), etc.

•  Onset of treatment effect for both 
ocrelizumab and rituximab is around 
12 weeks, with an immediate 
reduction of progression rates in the 
active arm compared with rapid 
progression in corresponding 
placebo patients  
o  Ocrelizumab has a rapid 
and near complete 
suppressive effect on acute 
inflammation, as seen by a 
significant suppression on 
T1-Gd lesions by the first 
post-randomization MRI at 
week 24 (96% reduction, 
p<0.0001).  The on 
treatment effects on T1-Gd 
lesions were not measured 
in OLYMPUS.  
•  The shape of the ocrelizumab and 
rituximab curve is similar. The 
placebo arms in both OLYMPUS 
and ORATORIO flaten between 
week 48 and week 96, although it is 
more pronounced in ORATORIO. 
This could be a chance finding (not 
observed in secondary endpoints)  
•  The later progression events 
observed in the placebo arm of 
ORATORIO are likely due to both 
chronic (T2 lesions) and later 
appearing acute (post-baseline new 
T1-Gd lesions) inflammation.  
Ocrelizumab has a suppressive 
effect on both T2 and new T1-Gd 
lesions, and this is consistent with 
the later separation in the treatment 
arms. There is no equivalent period 
in OLYMPUS since the study 
concluded at 96 weeks

•  The placebo progression 
in both ORATORIO and 
OLYMPUS is slower in 
T1 Gd negative patients 
compared to T1 Gd 
positive patients 
• 
In both ORATORIO and 
OLYMPUS treatment 
effect starts to emerge 
around week 60 and 
curves keep separating, 
consistent with constant 
risk reduction 
•  Since ocrelizumab also 
has a suppressive effect 
on chronic inflammation, 
as seen by a significant 
suppression of T2 lesion 
volume, more prominent 
on the later MRI 
timepoints (Figure 3, 
secondary endpoint).  
During this second 
period, T2 volume 
increases with a steeper 
slope in the placebo arm, 
coupled with near 
complete suppression in 
the ocrelizumab arm. 
This results in the 
second observed 
separation of the 
treatment arms. 
•  A similar pattern of T2 
lesion volume reduction 
was observed in 
OLYMPUS.

Analyses within the subgroup of patients above or equal 51 years of age are difficult to interpret due to 
the very small number of patients.

Notes 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
RMS 
A Pooled Analysis Report was generated to report results of the efficacy and safety analyses performed 
using  the  pooled  dataset  collected  in  Studies  WA21092  and  WA21093  because  of  the  pre-specified 
intent  to  pool  the  data  from  the  two  trials  to  maintain  sufficient  power  to  detect  relevant  treatment 
differences in the analysis of CDP and CDI endpoints.

Pooling criteria were pre-specified; to assess the validity of pooling data across Studies WA21092 and 
WA21093,  demographics,  baseline  characteristics,  ARR  results,  and  12-week  CDP  results  were 
compared  between  the  trials.    Demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  were  comparable  across  the 
two  studies.    No  statistically  significant  treatment  by  study  interaction  effect  was  seen  in  the 
annualized  protocol  defined  ARR  between  studies  (p  =  0.9538)  showing  that  the  treatment  effect  in 
this  endpoint  was  similar  in  both  studies.    Finally,  12-week  CDP  was  qualitatively  similar,  with  both 
studies showing similar hazard ratios of the same size in favour of ocrelizumab compared to interferon 
beta-1a  in  patients  treated  with  ocrelizumab  than  those  treated  with  interferon  beta-1a  44µg  SC.  
Taken  together,  these  data  confirmed  the  patient  population  and  treatment  difference  between  OCR 
and  IFN  groups  was  broadly  consistent  between  the  two  studies  and  that  the  prospectively-defined 
pooling criteria had been met to allow valid pooling of the data. 
A total of 1656 patients were enrolled into Studies WA21092 and WA21093 (821 patients for WA21092 
and  835  patients  for  WA21093).    Enrolled  patients  were  randomized  1:1  to  interferon  beta-1a  44  µg 
SC (N = 411 for WA21092 and N =418 for WA21093) or ocrelizumab 600 mg (N = 410 for WA21092 
and N = 417 for WA21093). 
Key Findings 
Ocrelizumab  significantly  and  consistently  reduced  the  ARR  at  Week  96  compared  with 
• 
interferon beta-1a in Studies WA21092 and WA21093. 
Both  studies  achieved  the  primary  endpoint;  treatment  with  ocrelizumab  led  to  consistently  and 
statistically  significant  46%  and  47%  reductions  in  the  ARR  compared  with  interferon  beta-1a  in 
WA21092 and WA21093, respectively.  When data from the studies was pooled, ocrelizumab treatment 
resulted in a 47% reduction in ARR. 
In Studies WA21092 and WA21093, treatment with ocrelizumab led to a suppression in the number of 
relapses experienced from a rate equivalent to one relapse approximately every 3.5 years in patients 
treated with interferon beta-1a (adjusted ARR of 0.292 and 0.290, respectively) to a rate equivalent to 
one relapse approximately every 6.5 years in patients treated with ocrelizumab (adjusted ARR of 0.156 
and 0.155, respectively). 
Ocrelizumab showed significant impact on measures of disability progression. 
Ocrelizumab consistently and significantly reduced the risk of 12- and 24-week CDP compared 
• 
to  interferon  beta-1a  in  the  pooled  population  of  Studies  WA21092  and  WA21093,  as  well  as  the 
individual study results. 
• 
Ocrelizumab  significantly  increased  the  proportion  of  patients  with  12-week  CDI  compared  to 
interferon  beta-1a  in  the  pooled  population  of  Studies  WA21092  and  WA21093,  as  well  as  the 
individual results of Study WA21092, but had no significant effect on 12-week CDI in Study WA21093. 
• 
Ocrelizumab  significantly  increased  the  MSFC  score  change  from  baseline  to  Week  96  when 
compared to interferon beta-1a in Study WA21093 and the pooled population of Studies WA21092 and 
WA21093, but had no significant effect on MSFC in Study WA21092. 
The robustness of these results was demonstrated by the consistency of results between the sensitivity 
analyses and the ITT, particularly those including the initial event of neurological worsening during the 
double-blind treatment period as well as the SFU to 96 weeks, using 50% imputation and using 100% 
imputation,  with  hazard  ratios  of  0.57  - 0.60 in  Study  WA21092,  0.60  -  0.64  in  Study  WA21093  and 
0.60 - 0.61 in the pooled population. 
The  MSFC  scale  is  a  neurological  rating  scale,  which  provides  a  global  quantitative  estimate  of  MS 
disability  in  three  clinical  dimensions  (leg  function/ambulation;  arm/hand  function;  and  cognitive 
function),  and  was  a  secondary  endpoint  in  Studies  WA21092  and  WA21093.    Treatment  with 
ocrelizumab was associated with a significantly greater improvement in the MSFC z-score change from 
baseline to Week 96 compared with treatment with interferon beta-1a in Study WA21093 (difference in 
adjusted means 0.107, p = 0.0040) and the pooled populations (difference in adjusted means 0.077, p

= 0.0038), however, no significant difference between treatment groups was seen in Study WA21092 
(difference in adjusted means 0.039, p = 0.3261). 
Ocrelizumab  showed  significant  suppression  of  MRI  disease  activity  across  all  pre-planned  MRI 
endpoints 
• 
Ocrelizumab  consistently  and  significantly  reduced  the  total  number  of  T1  Gd-enhancing 
lesions,  the  number  of  new  and/or  enlarging  T2  lesions  and  the  total  number  of  new  T1  hypointense 
lesions  by  Week  96  compared  to  interferon  beta-1a  in  Studies  WA21092  and  WA21093  and  in  the 
pooled population. 
• 
Ocrelizumab  statistically  significantly  reduced  the  rate  of  whole  brain  volume  loss  from  Week 
24  to  Week  96  compared  to  interferon  beta-1a  in  the  pooled  population  of  Studies  WA21092  and 
WA21093.  While Studies WA21092 and WA20193 also reported a reduction in brain volume loss, the 
result  in  Study  WA21093  was  not  statistically  significant  and  the  result  in  Study  WA21092  is 
considered non-confirmatory 
• 
NEDA was a pre-planned secondary endpoint to be analyzed only on the cohort of patients with 
a  baseline  EDSS  score  ≥  2.0.  It  was  a  composite  endpoint  based  on  relapse,  CDP  and  MRI  activity.  
Patients  were  considered  to  have  NEDA  if  they  had  experienced  no  protocol-defined  relapses,  no  12 
week  CDP  event  and  no  MRI  showing  disease  activity  (defined  as  Gd-enhancing  T1  lesions  or  new 
and/or enlarging T2 lesions) during the 96-week treatment period. 
The  proportion  of  patients  with  baseline  EDSS  ≥  2  who  had  NEDA  during  the  double-blind  treatment 
period was greater in the OCR group (46%) than in the IFN group (26%) in the pooled population from 
Studies  WA21092  and  WA21093,  representing  a 77%  relative increase  (p  < 0.0001).    Similar  results 
were  seen  in  the  individual  studies,  however  while  p  <  0.0001  in  both  studies,  this  was  non-
confirmatory as the endpoints followed a non-significant p-value in the hierarchical testing procedures. 
In addition to the pre-specified secondary endpoint, NEDA was also analyzed for the ITT population (all 
patients  independent  of  the  baseline  EDSS  score)  in  the  individual  studies  as  well  as  in  the  pooled 
population of both studies.  In the pool of both studies, a greater proportion of patients showed NEDA 
in  the  OCR  group  (48%)  compared  with  the  IFN  group  (27%),  representing  a  75%  improvement  for 
ocrelizumab versus the IFN group, p < 0.0001. The result of the pooled population was in line with the 
results of the individual studies 
Efficacy in Subgroups of Different Disease Activity: Pooled Analyses 
There are no agreed definitions of active and highly active disease activity in the European Union. The 
Sponsor  took  into  account  that  patients  with  disease  activity  on  treatment  may  have  more  active 
disease  than  those  with  disease  activity  off  treatment,  as  well  as  labelling  precedents  and  definitions 
established  by  other  Sponsors  as  a  guide.  Based  on  these  considerations  the  Sponsor  pre-specified 
four subgroups (Table 35) of active and highly active disease containing both treatment naïve patients 
and  patients  who  had  inadequately  responded  to  prior  therapy  in  the  WA21092/WA21093  SAP.  The 
subgroups  as  defined  are  not  mutually  exclusive  (i.e.,  are  defined  as  minimum  levels  of  disease 
activity). 
Consistent  with  the  final  European  MS  guideline,  which  recommends  that  separate  conclusions  of  the 
efficacy and safety in RMS patients both with low and high disease activity, to be provided at the time 
of benefit risk assessment (EMA/CHMP/771815/2011, Rev. 2), these data enable full understanding of 
the benefit/risk of ocrelizumab.

(changing from 0-5 to 6-9 lesions or from 6-9 lesions to  > 9 
lesions), as compared to the prior MRI 
Gd = gadolinium. 
For  efficacy,  all  four  subgroups  were  analyzed  for  the  primary  endpoint  (ARR)  and  key  secondary 
endpoints (12 and 24- week CDP, 12-week CDI at 12 weeks, T1 Gd-enhancing lesions and new and/or 
enlarging  T2  hyperintense  lesions).  The  pre-specified  analyses  for  all  subgroups  pooled  the  Study 
WA21092  and  WA21093  data  to  ensure  at  least  100  patients  in  each  subgroup  and  enable  adequate 
detection of treatment differences.   
Overall,  a  treatment  benefit  of  ocrelizumab  compared  with  interferon  beta-1a  was  observed  in  both 
active  and  highly  active  subgroups  across  all  endpoints  analyzed,  including  ARR  and  12-week  CDP, 
consistent with the findings in the ITT population (Figure 3 for ARR across subgroups and Figure 4 for 
12-week CDP across subgroups). Importantly, consistency across all subgroups was observed between 
the 12-week and 24-week CDP result, which again is consistent with the 12- and 24-week CDP result 
in the ITT population.

Clinical studies in special populations 
No such dedicated clinical studies were performed.  The main studies included adult subjects up to the 
age of 55 years in RMS and PPMS. No clinical studies were performed in the paediatric population. 
Supportive study(ies) 
RMS 
No stand-alone supportive clinical studies were claimed by the Applicant except for Study 21494 which 
has already been described in previous sections. However, the OLEs to studies WA21092 and WA21093 
can be regarded as providing supportive data for persistence of efficacy: 
The  pooled  population  of  patients  enrolled  in  the  OLE  of  Studies  WA21092  and  WA21093  who  were 
originally in the OCR treatment group during the 96 week double-blind treatment period of the studies 
and  who  had  completed  an  additional  46  weeks  of open-label  treatment  with  ocrelizumab  showed  an 
unadjusted  ARR  of  0.142  (see  table  below).    This  was  consistent  with  the  unadjusted  ARR  of  0.137 
seen in the pooled population during the 96-week double-blind treatment period providing evidence for 
persistence of the efficacy of ocrelizumab on relapses in RMS for up to 3 years. 
There  are  limited  data  on  follow-up  in  OLE,  therefore  results  should  be  interpreted  with  caution, 
however patients who were originally in the IFN group during the 96 week double-blind period of the 
studies  also  showed  a  benefit  following  switching  to  ocrelizumab  in  the  OLE,  with  an  ARR  of  0.137 
following  46  weeks  of  ocrelizumab  treatment  in  the  pooled  population  OLE  population  comparable  to 
that seen in the pooled OCR group and lower than  the rate of 0.249 seen in the pooled IFN group in 
the 96 week double-blind period of Studies WA21092 and WA21093. 
Assessment report  
EMA/790835/2017

The  pooled  population  of  patients  enrolled  in  the  OLE  of  Studies  WA21092  and  WA21093  who  were 
originally in the OCR treatment group during the 96 week double-blind treatment period of the studies 
and  who  had  completed  an  additional  46  weeks  of  open-label  treatment  with  ocrelizumab  showed  a 
low  rate  of  MRI  lesion  activity  with  95.3%  experiencing  no  new  and/or  enlarging  T2  lesions.  This 
provides  evidence  for  persistence  of  the  efficacy  of  ocrelizumab  on  an  objective  and  quantifiable 
marker of disease activity in RMS up to 3 years. 
Patients who were originally in the IFN group during the 96 week double-blind treatment period of the 
studies also showed a benefit following switching to ocrelizumab in the OLE, with 80.1% experiencing 
no  new  and/or  enlarging  T2  lesions  following  46  weeks  of  ocrelizumab  treatment  in  the  pooled 
population of the OLE of Studies WA21092 and WA21093.  This was in line with the time course of the 
effect of ocrelizumab on new and/or enlarging T2 lesions seen in the double blind period. 
PPMS 
No new stand-alone supportive studies were claimed by the Applicant and the OLE from Study 25046 
has not been reported at the time of this report. However, the Applicant argued that the Studies 21092 
and  21093  in  RMS  can  be  regarded  as  supportive  to  the  PPMS  Study  25046.  The  Applicant  therefore 
made a comparison of outcomes for endpoints that were shared between the PPMS Study 25046 and 
the  RMS  Studies  21092/21093,  inter  alia  12-week  CDP,  24-week  CDP  and  timed  25-foot  walk. 
However,  the  effect  size  seen  in  the  RMS  trials  for these  clinical  endpoints  favoured  numerically  RMS 
over PPMS although the RMS trials had a shorter duration and used an active control (in the PPMS trial 
the control was placebo). 
Clinical Progression Primary Endpoint 
Confirmed Disability Progression Sustained for at Least 12 Weeks: 
Treatment with ocrelizumab in the Study WA25046 in PPMS patients led to a 24% reduction in the risk 
of  12-week  CDP  compared  with  placebo.  Similarly,  the  results  of  the  pooled  data  analysis  of  Studies 
WA21092  and  WA21093  in  RMS  indicate  that  ocrelizumab  treatment  leads  to  a  significant  40% 
decrease in risk of 12-week CDP from baseline to week 96 when compared with the interferon beta-1a, 
with significant reductions of 43% and 37% also seen in the individual studies. 
Clinical Progression Secondary Endpoints 
Confirmed Disability Progression Sustained for at Least 24 Weeks: 
The  analysis  of  the  time  to  onset  of  CDP  for  at  least  24  weeks  in  Study  WA25046  in  PPMS  was 
consistent with the primary endpoint, where treatment with ocrelizumab led to a 25% reduction in the 
risk  of  24-week  CDP  compared  with  placebo.  In  support  of  this,  the  pooled  data  analysis  of  Studies 
WA21092  and  WA21093  in  RMS  patients  indicates  that  ocrelizumab  treatment  leads  to  a  significant 
40%  decrease  in  24-week  CDP  compared  with  interferon  beta-1a,  with  significant  reductions  of  43% 
and 37% also seen in the individual studies.  
Timed 25-foot Walk: 
Ocrelizumab treatment resulted in a 29% relative reduction in the percent progression in T25-FW over 
120 weeks compared with placebo in the Study WA25046 in PPMS.  The pooled analysis results of the 
T25-FW  exploratory  endpoint  in  the  RMS  Studies  WA21092  and  WA21093  supports  this  effect,  with 
ocrelizumab leading to an 83% relative reduction in T25-FW over 96 weeks compared with interferon 
beta-1a  (Pooled  summary).    The  results  seen  in  the  individual  studies  were  inconsistent  (22%  and 
117% reductions, respectively).

Treatment with ocrelizumab in Study WA25046 in PPMS patients reduced the rate of brain volume loss 
over the interval from Week 24 to Week 120 by 17.5% relative to placebo. Similarly, the pooled data 
analysis of the RMS Studies WA21092 and WA21093 indicated that treatment with ocrelizumab led to 
18.8%  relative  reduction  in  mean  percent  brain  volume  loss  from  Week  24  to  Week  96  in  an  RMS 
population, compared with interferon beta-1a treatment, with 23% and 15% reductions shown in the 
individual studies, respectively. 
Exploratory MRI Endpoint 
MRI: T2 Hyperintense Lesion Volume: 
In the PPMS Study WA25046 ocrelizumab significantly decreased the total volume of T2 hyperintense 
lesions from baseline to Week 120 by 3.4%, compared with an increase the total volume by 7.4% in 
patients  treated  with  placebo.  The  exploratory  analyses  of  T2  hyperintense  lesion  volume  in  the 
Studies  WA21092  and  WA21093  showed  that  treatment  with  ocrelizumab  also  leads  to  a  7.3%  and 
7.0%  decrease,  respectively,  in  the  total  volume  of  T2  hyperintense  lesions  at  96  weeks  in  the  RMS 
population  in  these  studies,  compared  with  a  2.5%  and  2.1%  decrease,  respectively,  in  the  groups 
treated with interferon beta-1a. 
MRI: New and/or Enlarging T2 Lesion Count: 
In an exploratory analysis of Study WA25046, treatment with ocrelizumab resulted in a 91.9% relative 
reduction in new and/or enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions per scan compared with placebo in a PPMS 
population  over  120  Weeks.    Similarly,  the  pooled  data  analysis  of  the  RMS  Studies  WA21092  and 
WA21093  indicated  that  treatment  with  ocrelizumab  led  to  80%  relative  reduction  in  the  number  of 
new  and/or  enlarging  T2  hyperintense  lesions  to  Week  96  in  the  pooled  RMS  population  of  Studies 
WA21092 and WA21093, compared with interferon beta-1a, a drug that potentially reduces T2 lesions 
in its own right.  77% and 83% relative reductions were seen in the individual studies, respectively.  
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Five different versions of the test product ocrelizumab were used in the clinical studies 21493, 21092, 
21093, and 25046 (OLEs inclusive).  The ADCC potency of the material used in Phase II Study 21493 
(used  for  dose  finding)  was  different  from  the  ADCC  potency  of  the  version  (0.4)  used  in  Phase  III. 
From a quality point of view, the version intended to market is similar to version 0.4 used in the Phase 
III studies.   
RMS 
Confirmatory clinical efficacy data were derived from two efficacy superiority trials in adults (≤55 years 
of age) with identical design (Study 21092 and Study 21093). These two main studies were RCTs with 
duration  of  96  weeks  that  were  overall  appropriately  designed,  and  used  an  appropriate  study  RMS 
population  with  active  disease.  Based  on  the  inclusion  criteria,  patients  with  relapsing  forms  of  MS 
were  included  in  studies  WA21092  and  WA21093.  Patients  with  SPMS  were  also  included  in  RMS 
studies  WA21092  and  WA21093.  However,  the  physician’s  assessment  of  whether  the  patient  was  in 
the  relapsing-remitting  or  in  the  secondary  progressive  course  of  the  disease  was  not  collected  at 
baseline.  In  order  to  identify  SPMS  patients,  the  Applicant  retrospectively  established  a  new  baseline 
for  EDSS,  T25-FW,  and  9-Hole  peg  test  for  each  patient  30  days  after  the  onset  of  each  protocol-
defined  relapse  -  for  accounting  for  any  residual  disability  due  to  a  relapse  event  -  and  requiring 
progression in the absence of relapse. Moreover, in addition to the ITT population, the treatment effect 
of  OCR  was  estimated  in  the  subgroup  matching  the  definition  of  SPMS  identified  using  the  MSBase 
cohort  (disability  progression  independent  of  relapses,  baseline  EDSS  ≥4.0  and  Pyramidal  FFS  ≥2) 
(Lorscheider  et  al.  2016).  Post-hoc  analyses  on  relapse-independent  disability  progression  were 
performed during the treatment period on the pooled data of studies WA21092 and WA21093 and were 
limited  to  the  96  week  double-blind  treatment  period.  Disability  progression  was  measured  by  using 
the  composite  disability  endpoint  (increase  in  EDSS  that  is  sustained  for  at  least  12/24  weeks,  or  a 
Assessment report  
EMA/790835/2017

20% increase in the timed 25-foot walk [T25-FW] that is sustained for at least 12/24 weeks, or a 20% 
increase in the 9-HPT that is sustained for at least 12/24 weeks [12/24-week composite endpoint]) in 
order  to  better  characterize  aspects  of  disease  progression  potentially  missed  with  EDSS  alone  (e.g. 
arm  function)  and  to  increase  the  sensitivity  of  detecting  events  of  disease  progression  over  EDSS 
alone. 
The studies included no placebo control but the active comparator was interferon beta-1a (Rebif®) SC 
(randomisation ratio 1:1) and this active control was dosed according to its labelling recommendations. 
The choice of active control was agreed as adequate. The test compound ocrelizumab was investigated 
for one fixed dose level (600 mg every 24 weeks) and the choice not to investigate a higher dose level 
was  not  questioned  since  the  supportive  dose  response  study  21493  did  not  reveal  any  efficacy 
advantages with a dose level of 2,000 mg.  It remains unclear whether a lower dose would have also 
been beneficial.  
Re-treatment  criteria  (i.e.  any  significant  or  uncontrolled  medical  condition  or  treatment-emergent, 
clinically significant laboratory abnormality; active infection; absolute neutrophil count < 1.5 × 103/μL; 
CD4  cell  count  <  250/μL;  hypogammaglobulinemia  IgG  <  3.3  g/L;  ongoing  pregnancy)  were  pre-
specified  by  the  Applicant  in  the  protocol,  based  on  a  biological  plausibility  considering  the  OCR 
mechanism of action, in order to allow doses to be delayed should one of these criteria be fulfilled. An 
association between lymphopenia and the decrease of CD4 and CD8 T cells below the LLN (lower limit 
of  normal)  and  neutropenia  and  an  increased  risk  of  serious  infection  in  OCR patients  was  found  and 
therefore this should be taken into consideration.  
The chosen primary endpoint (ARR) was appropriate and so were the secondary clinical and subclinical 
endpoints. The only shortcoming was that the secondary endpoints did not comprise an assessment of 
clinical global impression of change as recommended in the relevant EMA guideline. However, this was 
only considered a minor issue. The primary endpoint and the secondary endpoints were to be tested in 
a  hierarchical  manner  to  deal  with  the  issue  arising  from  multiplicity  in  the  testing.  The  secondary 
endpoint  CDP  12  Weeks  preceded  the  secondary  endpoint  CDP  24  Weeks  in  the  hierarchical  testing. 
The hierarchical testing procedure was agreed as appropriate. The pre-specified methods to deal with 
missingness for the primary endpoint ARR and the secondary endpoints CDP 12 Weeks, CDI 12 Weeks 
and CDP 24 Weeks were overall considered as appropriate. The pre-specified pooling of outcomes from 
the studies 21092 and 21093 for the primary analysis of the secondary endpoints CDP 12 Weeks, CDI 
12 Weeks and CDP 24 weeks was accepted. The pre-planned approach to pool efficacy data from the 
main  studies  21092  and  21093  for  the  primary  endpoint  ARR  and  the  secondary  endpoint  CDP  was 
acknowledged.  The  subgroup  analyses  based  on  pre-baseline  RMS  disease  intensities,  inadequate 
responders  to  previous  DMT  (based  on  response  to  previous  use  of  glatiramer  acetate  and/or 
interferon) and treatment naïve subjects was also accepted.    
No  stand-alone  supportive  clinical  studies  were  submitted  by  the  Applicant  (except  the  supportive 
proof-of-concept  and  dose  finding  study  21493).  The  main  studies  (Study  21092  and  Study  21093) 
had  OLEs  with  no  parallel  comparator  and  these  OLEs  can  potentially  be  regarded  to  provide 
supportive  evidence  of persistence of  efficacy  beyond  Week  96  (dependent  on  the outcome)  with  the 
limitations inherent to the design of such OLEs. 
The  supportive  phase  II  dose-response  study  21493  in  adults  with  RRMS  investigated  in  its  placebo 
controlled  double-blind  24-weeks  phase  600  mg  OCR  (divided  into  two  equal  doses  of  300  mg  two 
weeks  apart)  with  2,000  mg  OCR  (divided  into  two  equal  doses  of  1,000  mg  two  weeks  apart)  and 
used an appropriate primary endpoint and secondary endpoints for such a dose response study with an 
acceptable time point of 24 Weeks for the primary analyses. Since no correction for multiplicity testing 
was planned the trial does not qualify as pivotal.  
A European PIP was agreed with the PDCO for the condition treatment of MS. The PIP includes a waiver 
for SPMS and PPMS patients, in addition to RRMS patients below 10 years of age. The PIP also includes 
a  deferral  to  provide  results  in paediatric  RRMS  patients  from  10 to  <18  years  of  age.  It  is therefore 
appropriate that the submitted clinical studies do not encompass subjects under the age of 18 years.  
Assessment report

The clinical studies submitted did not enrol subjects with an age above 55 years. Efficacy results from 
adults ≤ 55 years of age cannot readily be extrapolated to adults > 55 years of age and the elderly as 
the  disease  changes  with  time  and  the  effect  size  might  be  smaller.  Moreover,  data  on  patients  with 
moderate and severe renal impairment are not available, however, this has been adequately reflected 
in the SmPC.  
PPMS 
Confirmatory clinical efficacy data was derived from one efficacy superiority trial in adults (≤55 years 
of age) with PPMS (Study 25046) with a disability grade corresponding to EDSS 3.0 to 6.5 points. This 
main study was a RCT (randomisation to OCR or placebo in a 2:1 ratio) with a placebo control but no 
active  control.  The  lack  of  active  control  is  justified  since  no  DMT  for  PPMS  has  been  licenced,  and 
there is a clear medical need for DMT. The study duration was appropriate with at least 120 weeks for 
each individual subject and a planned number of 253 events for the primary outcome variable CDP 12 
Weeks.  The  diagnosis  criteria  for  PPMS  were  in  accordance  with  the  revised  McDonald  criteria  2005. 
The test compound OCR was only investigated for one fixed dose level (600 mg [divided into two equal 
doses of 300 mg two weeks apart] every 24 weeks) and the lack of investigating of a lower dose level 
and a higher dose was questioned since no preceding dose response study was performed in a study 
population  with  PPMS  (only  in  RMSS,  see  above).  Efficacy  results  from  Studies  WA21092,  WA21093, 
and  WA25046  presented  by  exposure  (Cmean)  quartiles  seem  to  suggest  that  beneficial  effects  are 
mainly  seen  with  Cmeans  above  the  median  value.  This  supports  that  the  dose  used  could  be  the 
lowest  effective  dose.  There  are  no  data  available to  elucidate  whether  a  higher  dose  would  result  in 
even better efficacy. 
A total of 82% of patients in both treatment groups had not received previous treatment with steroid 
medication.  Of  the  18%  who  had  received  steroid  treatment,  the  majority  (17%  of  patients  in  the 
placebo group and 16% in the OCR group) received treatment with methylprednisolone. Only 2 in each 
group (OCR 0.4%, placebo 0.8%) received steroids for reasons related to “MS relapse”. 
The  primary  endpoint  CDP  was  appropriate  and  so  were  the  secondary  clinical  and  subclinical 
endpoints  although  the  secondary  endpoints  did  not  comprise  an  assessment  of  clinical  global 
impression  of  change  as  recommended  and  cognitive  performance  as  recommended  in  the  relevant 
EMA guideline, but this is a minor issue as for the RMS trials. The primary endpoint and the secondary 
endpoints were to be tested in a hierarchical manner to deal with the issue arising from multiplicity in 
the testing. CDP 12 Weeks was the primary endpoint, and preceded the first secondary endpoint CDP 
24 Weeks in the hierarchical testing. The hierarchical testing procedure was appropriate.  
No  stand-alone  supportive  study  was  submitted  in  support  of  the  PPMS  indication.  Instead  the 
Applicant  has  referred  to  and  compiled  clinical  and  subclinical  progression  endpoints  from  the  RMS 
Studies  21092  and  21093  and  compared  these  outcomes  with  outcomes  for  the  corresponding 
endpoints in the PPMS Study 25046. Such data can only be regarded as remotely supportive since they 
originate  from  a  MS  disease  entity  other  than  PPMS.  The  Applicant  also  presented  data  from  the 
extended  controlled  treatment  period  of  Study  WA25046  (approximately  2½-6  additional  months  of 
blinded  treatment).  The  studies  in  RMS  and  PPMS  study  did  not enrol  subjects  with  an  age  above 55 
years.  Efficacy  results  from  adults  ≤  55  years  of  age  cannot  readily  be  extrapolated  to  adults  >  55 
years of age and the elderly as the disease changes with time and the effect size might be smaller. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
RMS 
The main study 21092 met its primary endpoint; treatment with OCR significantly reduced the ARR by 
46.4%  at  96  Weeks  compared  with  interferon  beta-1a  (p  <  0.0001)  and  consistent  estimates  of 
treatment  effect  were  observed  in  all  pre-specified  sensitivity  analyses  of  the  primary  endpoint  (e.g. 
patients  who  withdraw  early  without  an  ongoing  relapse  were  imputed  for  100%  of  the  patients  to 
have  had  a  relapse  at  the  time  of  withdrawing).  The  demonstrated  effect  size  is  considered  clinically 
relevant. The rates of overall early withdrawal were acceptable (14% out of 821 randomised patients) 
and  favoured  numerically  the  ocrelizumab  treatment  group  compared  to  IFN.  For  this  reason,  the

sensitivity analyses were not considered completely reassuring of not introducing some overestimation 
of the treatment effect so, a more conservative approach was required.  The tipping point analysis was 
provided by the Applicant and showed that the statistical significance is lost only in the very extreme 
scenario. The continued hierarchical statistical testing for the secondary endpoints CDP 12 weeks (pre-
specified pooled results with Study 21093), most MRI endpoints, CDI 12 Weeks (pre-specified pooled 
analysis)  and  CDP  24  Weeks  (pre-specified  pooled  analysis)  revealed  statistically  significant  findings. 
The  secondary  endpoint  MSFC  was  not  met,  and  therefore  the  hierarchical  statistical  testing  for  the 
remaining  secondary  endpoints  MRI  Brain  volume  (p  =  0.0042)  and  NEDA  (p  <  0.0001)  was  non-
confirmatory,  whilst  the  statistical  significance  testing  for  SF-36  PCS  was  clearly  negative.  Still  the 
results for change in Brain volume and NEDA are encouraging. The study in itself also had statistically 
significant  outcomes  for  CDP  12  Weeks  and  CDP  24  Weeks,  but  not  for  CDI  12  weeks.  In  the  main 
analysis, missingness for CDP 12 Weeks, CDP 24 Weeks and CDI 12 Weeks was handled appropriately, 
and  with  positive  results,  with  a  conservative  definition  of  non-CDI  for  subjects  who  withdrew 
prematurely,  but  more  conservative  imputation  assumptions  were  required in  the  sensitivity  analyses 
for CDP 12 Weeks and CDP 24 Weeks. The positive changes seen for CDP 12 Weeks and CDP 24 Weeks 
are  regarded  as  clinically  relevant  in  terms  of  effect  size  and  the  additional  sensitivity  analyses 
provided by the Applicant showed the consistency of the results. 
The  other  main  study  21093  also  met  its  primary  endpoint;  treatment  with  ocrelizumab  significantly 
reduced  the  ARR  by  46.8%  at  96  Weeks  compared  with  interferon  beta-1a  (p  <  0.0001)  and  in  this 
main study, there were consistent estimates of treatment effect observed in all pre-specified sensitivity 
analyses  of  the  primary  endpoint.  As  for  Study  21092,  this  effect  size  is  also  judged  as  clinically 
relevant although a more conservative approach in sensitivity analysis was requested for the primary 
endpoint.  The  tipping  point  analysis  was  provided  by  the  Applicant  reassuring  on  robustness  and 
consistency of results of the main analysis. The rates of overall early withdrawal was somewhat higher 
than  in  Study  21092  (19%  out  of  835  randomised  patients)  and  even  more  strongly  favoured 
numerically  the  ocrelizumab  treatment  group  compared  to  IFN.  Most  secondary  endpoints  were  met 
following a hierarchical statistical significance testing, including pooled analyses of CDP 12 Weeks, CDI 
12 Weeks and CDP 24 Weeks except for one study specific MRI endpoint (Brain volume). The study in 
itself  also  had,  as  in  Study  21092,  statistically  significant  outcomes  for  CDP  12  Weeks  and  CDP  24 
Weeks, but not for CDI 12 weeks. In the main analysis, missingness for CDP 12 Weeks, CDP 24 Weeks 
and CDI 12 Weeks was handled appropriately, and with positive results, with a conservative definition 
of  non-CDI  for  subjects  who  withdrew  prematurely,  but  additional  and  more  conservative  sensitivity 
analyses for CDP 12 Weeks and CDP 24 Weeks were requested and showed robustness of the results. 
The positive changes seen for CDP 12 Weeks and CDP 24 Weeks are regarded as clinically relevant in 
terms of effect size. Step. no. 9 in the hierarchical testing chain, change in Brain volume, did not show 
any  statistically  significant  difference  versus  the  active  control  (p  =  0.09)  and  the  subsequent 
hierarchical  testing  was  therefore  broken  and  non-confirmatory  (SF-36  PCS,  p=0.0404;  NEDA, 
p<0.0001). Still, the results for NEDA are encouraging.  
As regard to the Per-Protocol (PP) sensitivity analyses, the Applicant gave some clarifications about the 
distribution  of  protocol  deviations  by  treatment  group:  overall,  the  number  of  patients  with  any 
protocol  deviation  (both  major  and  minor)  was  comparable  between  the  two  treatment  groups  (IFN 
beta-1a  and  OCR)  with  a  trend  towards  an  overall  higher  proportion  of  patients  with  protocol 
deviations in study WA21093 compared to study WA21092. As regarding the major protocol violations 
leading  and  not  leading  to  exclusion  from  PP  analysis,  some  slight  differences  between  OCR  and  IFN 
beta-1a  were  observed  in  study  WA21092.  However,  the  results  of  the  requested  more  conservative 
and  strict  PP  analyses  including  any  major  protocol  deviation  (i.e.  those  leading  and  not  leading  to 
exclusion  from  the  initial  PP  analysis)  were  comparable  and  consistent  with  those  of  the  analyses 
performed on the ITT population. 
Subgroups  analyses  across  the  main  studies  21092  and  21093  did  not  identify  a  subgroup  clearly 
yielding  more  or  less  treatment  benefit  when  disease  activity  (“active”  disease  or  “highly  active 
disease”  arbitrarily  defined)  was  combined  with  treatment  naïve  subjects  and  non-responders  (also 
arbitrarily defined). However, for ARR, patients who were active or highly active inadequate responders 
or highly active treatment naïve appeared to have a borderline better treatment effect than those who 
were not. However, in every subgroup ocrelizumab showed superior efficacy compared to IFN. For CDP

12  Weeks,  treatment  naïve  subjects  with  active  and  highly  active  disease  activity  tended  numerically 
to have less treatment benefit.  
Patients who weigh <75 kg and those with a BMI <25 were less likely to have a CDP sustained for 12 
weeks  and  24  weeks  during  the  96  double-blind  treatment  period.  The  Applicant  discussed  the 
potential explanations for the different effect of body weight/BMI and therefore drug exposure on ARR 
and  disability  in  terms  of  12-week  and  24-week  CDP.  Data  on  an  exposure  –  response  analyses 
exploring the correlation between four exposure (Cmean) quartiles with the key study endpoints were 
subsequently  provided  and  showed that  for  ARR  no  substantial  differences  across  the quartiles in  the 
OCR  group  were  observed,  consistently  with  the  subgroup  analyses  by  body  weight  and  BMI. 
Conversely,  for  the  secondary  endpoints  12-week  and  24-week  CDP,  patients  with  higher  exposure 
(i.e. lower body weight) received more benefit from the treatment with OCR compared to patients with 
lower  exposure  (i.e.  higher  body  weight).  A  hypothesis  involving  the  potential  role  of  the  two-stage 
process of RMS (i.e. first stage driven by inflammation; second stage driven by both inflammation and 
neurodegneration)  and  the  degree  of  blood-brain  barrier  (BBB)  alterations  influencing  the  OCR 
penetration into the brain was advanced by the Applicant. Although this hypothesis might have some 
biological  plausibility,  it  cannot  be  supported  according  to  the  PK/PD  data,  because,  first,  no 
information  is  available  with  regards  to  OCR  concentration  in  brain  or  cerebral  spinal  fluid  following 
OCR administration in humans or in animals; second, monoclonal antibodies and other large-molecule 
biotherapeutics  are  known  to  have  limited  diffusion  across  BBB  with  a  brain  concentration  ratio  of 
approximately  0.1%  relative  to  circulating  serum  concentrations  (Yu  and  Watts  2013);  third,  a  study 
(Study 14-3756) in healthy monkeys showed that OCR does not significantly penetrate the brain and 
peak  values  of  activity  within  24  hours  after  injection  of  [111-In]  ocrelizumab  in  the  brain  that  were 
<1%  of  the  injected  dose  were  found.  In  patients  with  MS  for  whom  there  is  evidence  of  BBB 
disruption, it is actually not known which could be the degree of brain penetration of OCR but, based 
on  the  above  mentioned  PK  data,  it  can  be  argued  that  it  might  be  not  such  high.  Therefore,  no 
definite conclusions can be drawn on this issue. However, it cannot be excluded that in RMS patients or 
particularly  in  RMS  patients  who  start  to  accumulate  disability  or  are  in  advanced  disease  stage  an 
influence of body weight/drug exposure on the effect of OCR on disability burden might exist.   
The  Applicant  has provided  additional  subgroup  analyses  (pooled  data  from  Study  21092  and 21093) 
for  the  subgroup  of  non-treatment-naïve  subjects  and  treatment-naïve  subjects,  respectively, 
regardless of pre-study disease activity.  Treatment benefit was observed in both treatment-naive and 
non-treatment-naive subgroups for the primary endpoint ARR. For 12-week CDP and 24-week CDP, the 
treatment  benefit  in  non-treatment-naive  patients  was  numerically  on  par  with  the  benefit  in 
treatment-naive  patients  but  statistical  significance  was  lost  for  the  non-treatment-naive  subgroup 
probably due to small numbers. 
The  results  of  the  requested  subgroup  analyses  on  primary  and  key  secondary  endpoints  by  disease 
duration  by  symptom  onset  and  MS  diagnosis  showed  that  overall  for  ARR,  the  effect  of  OCR  seems 
not to be influenced by the disease duration, although in study WA21093 a trend favouring OCR effect 
in  patients  with  longer  disease  duration  was  observed.  The  results  on  the  secondary  disability 
endpoints  (12-week  and  24-week  CDP)  are  more  heterogeneous  and  therefore  it  is  not  possible  to 
individuate a specific pattern of treatment response and to draw definite conclusions on the influence 
of disease duration on OCR effect. 
Regarding  the  above  mentioned  subgroup  analyses  on  SPMS,  the retrospective  identification  of  these 
patients based on not pre-specified definitions, allowed the identification of a number of patients within 
the ITT population in a range from 1.9% to 10.2%. Therefore, the numbers are very small and the ITT 
population of RMS studies WA21092 and WA21093 resulted in predominantly (~90% or greater) RRMS 
patients.  Overall,  it  is  acknowledged that  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  SPMS,  the  direction  of  the 
effect in terms of HR and risk reduction favoured OCR as compared to IFN beta-1a. However, statistical 
significance  in  terms  of  both  95%  CIs  and  p  values  was  not  always  achieved  for  all  the  single 
components  of  the  composite  disability  endpoint  used  across  each  SPMS  definition  adopted.    The 
analyses on SPMS have some limitations: post-hoc nature of the analyses; retrospective identification 
of SPMS based on not pre-specified definition; pooled data analyses; small number of patients with a 
probable diagnosis of SPMS; the 30-day period used for accounting for any residual disability due to a 
Assessment report

relapse event that may be not sufficient; statistical issues regarding the intrinsic characteristics of the 
composite endpoints to detect smaller effect as significant. Therefore, the results of these analyses are 
difficult  to  interpret  and  prevent  from  drawing  definite  conclusions  on  the  effect  of  OCR  on  SPMS 
independent of acute inflammatory events. In particular, they do not allow to exclude that the effect of 
OCR  on  disability  may  be  driven  by  its  effect  on  inflammation  and  on  inflammation-related  disability 
accumulation more than on the pure neurodegeneration-related disability.  
Moreover,  for  the  SPMS  patients  identified  in  the  two  studies  WA21092  and  WA21093,  it  would  have 
been interesting to have data on MRI-related disease activity such as Gd-enhancing lesions and new or 
enlarging  T2  lesions,  by  treatment  groups,  overall  and  by  relapse-independent  disability  progression. 
Finally,  the  clinical  relevance  of  these  results  on  SPMS  should  have  been  discussed,  for  example,  in 
terms of actual difference in progression delay between the two treatment groups, absolute difference 
in  the  proportion  of  patients  who  had  disability  progression,  and  time  for  performing  the  T25-FW. 
However, the above mentioned limitations of the analyses on SPMS would have remained.   
The  EMA  guidelines  on  MS  stated  that  “In  trials  intended  to  evaluate  the  relapse  rate,  it  is 
recommended not to include SPMS subjects with superimposed relapses as this might complicate trial 
design  and  hamper  the  interpretation  of  the  effect  on  relapses  and  disability”.  However,  it  is  also 
stated:  “It  is  reasonable  to  assume  that  relapses  in  RRMS  and  SPMS  have  the  same  underlying 
inflammatory  pathophysiology  and  therefore  efficacy  on  relapses  in  RRMS  patients  may  be 
extrapolated to efficacy on relapses in SPMS. However, extrapolation of the effect on disability will not 
be considered appropriate as pathophysiology is different”. Therefore, as the anti-inflammatory effect 
of  OCR  has  been  demonstrated  by  the  results  on  ARR  in  both  studies  WA21092  and  WA21093,  for 
reasons related to biological plausibility, this drug could be considered effective in preventing relapses 
not  only  in  patients  with  RRMS  but  also  in  those  with  SPMS.  Nevertheless,  it  should  be  taken  into 
account that in those patients who are in the conversion phase from RRMS to SPMS, the efficacy of a 
treatment on relapses is not necessarily translated into a reduction of the disability burden, particularly 
of the disability accumulation related to neurodegenerative mechanisms. 
The  Study  21092  and  the  Study  21093  tested  only  one  dose  level  of  ocrelizumab  (600  mg  every  24 
weeks;  first  dosing  as  300  mg  two  weeks  apart).  A  lower  therapeutic  optimal  dose  has  not  been 
unambiguously  identified  whilst  2,000  mg  ocrelizumab  (given  as  1,000  mg  two  weeks  apart)  in  the 
phase II trial 21493 did not convey any efficacy advantages over 600 mg.   
PPMS 
The only main study, study 25046, met its primary endpoint (time to event) but not with a compelling 
p value; treatment with ocrelizumab led to a 24% reduction in the risk of 12-week CDP compared with 
placebo  (hazard  ratio  0.76  [95%  CI:  0.59,  0.98],  p=0.0321).  In  the  CHMP  interactions  at  the  time 
before  the  MAA,  it  was  highlighted  that  statistical  evidence  stronger  than  p<0.05  on  the  primary 
endpoint would be required to account for the fact that a single trial in PPMS was to be conducted.  
The Kaplan-Meier survival curves for time to onset of 12-week CDP showed separation starting from 12 
weeks but the separation did not seem to increase thereafter. However, there was a lower proportion 
of  patients  in  the  ocrelizumab  group  with  CDP  compared  to  placebo  group  throughout  the  treatment 
period.  A  similar  pattern  for  the  Kaplan-Meier  survival  curves  was  seen  for  CDP  24  Weeks.  The 
absolute difference for proportion of patients with a 12 –Week CDP at Week 120 was just around 4% 
implying an NNT of 25 subjects. A similar absolute difference was seen for CDP 24 Weeks. 
The  robustness  of  the  results  of  the primary  endpoint  was  analysed  by  performing  various  sensitivity 
analyses.  Sensitivity  analyses  were  consistent  with  the  primary  analysis  in  terms  of  treatment  effect. 
With  regard  to  imputation  of  initial  disability  progression  events  for  patients  with  early  treatment 
discontinuation, the approach of ignoring these events resulted in a reduced treatment effect (HR 0.82 
[95% CI: 0.63, 1.07], p=0.1477). However, multiple imputation (HR 0.78 [95% CI: 0.60, 1.02]) and 
imputation by efficacy related reason for withdrawal / withdrawal by subject (HR 0.77 [95% CI: 0.60, 
1.00],  p=0.0490)  resulted  in  consistent  estimates  of  the  treatment  effect.  The  premature 
discontinuation  rate  (25%  out  of  732  randomised  patients)  was  somewhat  higher  than  the 
assumptions  for  the  sample  size  estimate  (20%).  Premature  discontinuation  rates  numerically  clearly

favoured ocrelizumab treatment compared to IFN. The continued hierarchical statistical testing for the 
secondary endpoints time to CDP 24 weeks (p =0.0365), change in timed walk from baseline to week 
120 (p = 0.0404), two MRI endpoints related to change in total T2 lesion volume and Brain volume (p 
<  0.0001  and  p  =  0.0206,  respectively)  were  met.  The  last  secondary  endpoint  SF-36  PCS  for  the 
hierarchical testing was not met.  
During the scientific assessment of the MAA the Applicant modified the indication to 'early PPMS', and 
better  reflect  the  results  of  the  performed  trial.  The  intention  was  to  align  the  indication  with  the 
patient  population  studied  in  Study  WA25046  (median  age  46  years  [range  18-56  years],  median 
duration of disease 5.5-6 years, median time since diagnosis 1.3-1.6 years). However, no specific age 
limit  - or  other  limit  -  was  introduced.  The  Applicant  argued  for  a  positive  B/R  balance  in  the  narrow 
indication  ‘early  PPMS’  by  presenting  WA25046  subgroup  analyses  showing  more  convincing  effect  in 
young  patients  whereas  side  effects  were  not  more  pronounced  in  them.  A  pre-specified  subgroup 
analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint  suggested  that  patients  who  are  younger  may  receive  a  greater 
treatment benefit than patients who are older (≤ 45 years: HR 0.64 (0.45, 0.92), >45 years: HR 0.88 
(0.62, 1.26). Similarly, a Forest plot illustrates age-dependence of the effect on 'Time to Onset of CDP' 
with a HR of 0.59 (p=0.0323) in the first age quartile (18-39 years), a HR of 0.71 (p=0.1984) in the 
second age quartile (40-46 years) etc. To some degree this is further supported by post-hoc subgroup 
analyses  of  the  rituximab  OLYMPUS  study  where  the  HR  for  'Time  to  CDP  (12  Weeks)'  was  0.49 
(p=0.0032)  for  patients  51  years  or  younger  whereas  there  appeared  to  be  no  treatment  effect  for 
patients older than 51 years. 
New analyses performed by the Applicant suggest that not only age but also T1-Gd enhancing lesions 
may modulate the effect of OCR on disability progression. 
In  particular,  systematic  analyses  of  all  available  baseline  covariates  (age,  T1  Gd-enhancing  lesions, 
time  since  MS  symptoms  onset,  time  since  MS  diagnosis,  and  EDSS  score  that  were  pre-specified 
subgroups, as well as additional covariates such as T2 lesion count, T2 lesion volume, non-enhancing 
T1  hypointense  lesion  volume,  time  since  MS  diagnosis  and  MSSS)  associated  with  maturity  of  the 
disease as well as MRI activity have been submitted. The treatment effect of OCR has been estimated 
within all subgroups as the hazard ratio (HR) for delaying the time to onset of 12-week CDP (primary 
endpoint)  as  well  as  12-week  composite  CDP  (pre-specified  exploratory  endpoint)  during  the  double-
blind treatment period. The use of the HR to describe the effect size instead of a comparison at time 
point Week 120, pre-specified for the primary endpoint, is considered acceptable for a summary report 
of  subgroup  analyses.  In  any  case,  as  regards  HR  data,  even  though  no  “subgroup  by  treatment 
interaction” resulted statistically significant, “age” and “presence of T1-Gd enhancing lesions” showed a 
favorable  trend  for  the  primary  outcome,  12-week  CDP.  Results  on  the  pre-specified  exploratory 
endpoints  12-week  composite  CDP  and  the  individual  components  T25-FW  and  9-HPT  showed  a 
consistent trend for age but a less consistent trend for the MRI parameters.  
Moreover,  in  both  studies WA02546  and  OLYMPUS  more  than  60%  of  patients  with  T1  Gd-enhancing 
lesions  at  baseline  were  below  the  respective  study  median  age,  suggesting  that  younger  age 
correlated  with  more  MRI  activity.  The  interaction  between  age  and  T1  Gd  enhancing  lesions  at 
baseline with regard to predicting OCR treatment effect was also investigated by estimating the hazard 
ratio  for  delaying  the  time  to  onset  of  12-week  CDP  (primary  endpoint)  during  the  double-blind 
treatment period within all four possible subgroup combinations.  
On the basis of the results of these analyses, the Applicant drew the following conclusions: i. age has 
the  greatest  influence  as  the  determining  factor  for  subgroup  efficacy,  with  young  patients  deriving 
substantial  treatment  benefit  from  ocrelizumab,  independent  of  T1  Gd-enhancement  status;  ii.  the 
presence  of  T1  Gd-enhancing  lesions  at  baseline  only  contributes  to  the  magnitude  of  the  treatment 
effect within the two age groups; iii. age and presence of gadolinium-enhancing lesions at baseline are 
overlapping and independent effects.  
However, based on analyses by strata and data description used by the Applicant it is difficult to draw 
conclusions on whether age is the variable that drives an increase of the effect size independent of the 
presence of T1 Gd-enhancing lesions (or viceversa) and, in addition, on whether there is an interaction 
effect or independence between these two variables (at least as a trend).

The summary 2x2 table below, derived by the data provided by the Applicant, can be helpful to better 
understand  the  trend  in  treatment  effect  modification  (in  terms  of  HR)  for  the  primary  outcome,  12-
week CDP, within the different components.

As the above table highlights, it is indeed difficult to identify only in age the main driver of treatment 
effect.  The  only  way  to  understand  the  effect  of  each  single  component  independently  of  the  other 
ones,  would  be  by  building  a  multivariate  Cox  regression  model  with  the  description  of  the  effect  by 
each single component independently of the other ones and by interaction components. 
Although subgroup analyses should not be over interpreted, it seems that younger patients with T1 
Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline have a better treatment effect [≤ 45 years: HR 0.52 (0.27-1.00); ≤ 
46 years (median age of the WA25046 study); HR 0.48 (0.25-0.92); <51 years: HR 0.53 (0.31-0.89)].  
This supports an indication in early PPMS early with imaging features characteristic of inflammatory 
activity.  
In the double-blind period the treatment effect appeared modest and could be interpreted as a delay of 
a few months in 12 week-CDP progression. The Applicant argued that EDSS progression (of 1.0 or 0.5 
EDSS points depending on baseline score) - and consequently any measurable delay in progression - is 
clinically  relevant.  Furthermore,  based  on  extrapolations  of  data  including  the  extended  controlled 
period,  a  delay in  median  time  to progression of  1.3  years  was  calculated. For  the  EDSS  7  milestone 
post-hoc  analyses  suggest  an  expected  delay  in  reaching  this  of  8.8  years.  However,  such 
extrapolations should be interpreted with caution. This is particularly true if it is taken into account that 
in  some  cases  extrapolation  was  carried  on  ahead  in  time  (i.e.  even  until  4  or  5  times  the  time  of 
observed  data).  Moreover,  these  extrapolations  incorporate  the  terminal  part  of  the  KM  curve, 
including  the  extended  controlled  period,  which  represents  an  area  of  statistical  uncertainties  due  to 
already previously discussed reasons (i.e., effect sizes similar to those obtained during the controlled 
treatment period with smaller p values due to the increase in the number of events for CDP endpoint; 
apparent  increase  in  the  separation  between  the  two  KM  curves  starting  from  Week  144  with  an 
apparent  augmentation  of  the  absolute  difference  between  OCR  and  placebo  and  a  consequent 
decrease  of  the  NNT;  the  period  after  144  weeks  coincides  with  the  actual  starting  of  the  gradual 
switch  to  the  open  label  extension,  there  are  too  many  graphically  reported  censored  patients 
compared to the period before week 144 with a strong decrease in the number of patients at risk; use 
of composite endpoints for data presentation with their intrinsic ability in case of time to event data to 
detect small effects).  
Furthermore, as previously pointed out, the extrapolation of efficacy results from RMS studies to PPMS 
population  performed  by  the  Applicant  in  support  of  the  one  pivotal  study  WA2546,  had  several 
limitations  (i.e.,  post-hoc  nature,  retrospective  identification  of  SPMS  patients,  pooled  data  analyses, 
small  number  of  patients,  the  30-day  period  used  for  accounting  for  any  residual  disability  due  to  a 
relapse  event,  and  the  intrinsic  ability  of  composite  endpoints  adopted  to  detect  smaller  effects)  and 
therefore are not definitely reliable. 
For the primary and secondary endpoints, time to onset of CDP sustained for at least 12 and 24 weeks, 
the  possible  reasons  underlying  the  lower  effect  of  OCR  in  females  was  discussed.  Data  on  the 
frequency  of  Gd-enhancing  lesions  at  baseline  in  males  and  females  were  provided.  This  showed  a 
slight  imbalances  in  the  female  subgroup  (OCR  29.4%  and  placebo  21.8%)  compared  with  the  male 
subgroup  (OCR  25.7%  and  placebo  27.7%)  with  more  Gd-enhancing  lesions  at  baseline  observed  in 
female patients receiving OCR. In terms of biological plausibility, the figures on the potential influence 
of Gd-enhancing lesion distribution on the effect of OCR by sex reported in descriptive, univariate and 
Assessment report

multivariate  analyses  would  not  substantially  explain  the  lower  treatment  effect  observed  in  female 
PPMS  patients.  The  same  reduction  of  OCR  efficacy  in  females  is  not  seen  in  RMS.  Uncertainties  on 
these subgroups remained, however, it was acknowledged that no definite conclusions could be drawn 
due  to  the  lack  of  power  of  the  study  for  subgroup  analyses  and  interaction  testing  and  the 
heterogeneity  and  inconsistency  of  results  across  the  different  endpoints.  As  regards  to  the  PP 
sensitivity analysis, it should be considered that a total of 157 major protocol deviations occurred in 68 
patients of the study (75 deviations of the inclusion or exclusion criteria and 82 deviations during study 
conduct).  However,  based  on  the  submitted  data,  it  seemed  that  there  were  some  discrepancies 
between  the  numbers  of  major  protocol  violations  initially  reported  and  those  provided  by  treatment 
group.  This  has  subsequently  been  clarified,  and  it  was  acknowledged  that  the  discrepancy  was 
relatively small. 
The remainder of the secondary endpoints were met in the hierarchical testing except for change from 
Baseline in SF-36 PCS Score but MMRM was used to handle missingness. As MMRM was not regarded 
as  being  sufficiently  conservative  method  in  dealing  with  missingness,  the  Applicant  subsequently 
presented  analyses  for  change  in  Total  Brain  Volume  using  a  pattern  mixture  model  with  imputation 
based  on  copy  reference.  This  imputation  method  was  regarded  as  conservative  by  CHMP  because  it 
assumed that there was no residual drug effect on brain volume loss after withdrawal from treatment. 
The results were to some degree consistent with the primary analysis. However, statistical significance 
was  lost  (treatment  difference  0.150,  p=0.0645)  using  this  method  instead  of  MMRM  (treatment 
difference 0.192, p=0.0206). 
For timed 25-foot walk and L2 lesion volume, LOCF analyses were presented. Results were in line with 
those obtained with MMRM. 
The Study 25046 tested only one dose level of ocrelizumab (600 mg [divided into two equal doses of 
300  mg  two  weeks  apart]  every  24  weeks).  The  proposed  posology  in  the  SmPC  is  600  mg  x  1. 
However, since B-cell depletion is associated with AUC and not Cmax, there should be no difference in 
expected treatment effect with the 600 mgx1 and the 300 mgx2 regimens. 
A  potentially  lower  or  higher  therapeutic  optimal  dose  has  not  been  investigated  in  the  PPMS 
population, whilst 2,000 mg ocrelizumab (divided into two equal doses of 1,000 mg two weeks apart) 
in the phase II trial 21493 in a RRMS population did not convey any efficacy advantages over 600 mg.   
Efficacy  results  from  Studies  WA21092,  WA21093,  and  WA25046  presented  by  exposure  (Cmean) 
quartiles seem to suggest that beneficial effects are mainly seen with Cmeans above the median value. 
This supported that the dose used could be the lowest effective dose. There were no data available to 
elucidate whether a higher dose would result in even better efficacy. 
Additional expert consultation 
Minutes and answers from the Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) Neurology 
Meeting for OCREVUS on 8 June 2017 
1. The SAG experts are invited to comment on the clinical relevance of the observed results 
in  the  study  WA25046  in  PPMS  patients.  The  experts  should  focus  on  the  clinical 
interpretation of the observed effect size and what it represents for these patients, as well 
as on the minimal clinically important difference that could be meaningful for such patients 
in the timeframe of the study duration. 
Most of the experts considered the trial population to be an atypical PPMS cohort, consisting mainly of 
younger  patients  likely  to  have  a  more  “active”  disease.  Therefore,  they  considered  that  the  results 
from the trial will have to be cautiously interpreted and that extrapolation of these results to the whole 
PPMS population may be questionable.  
Additional data in PPMS patients in the later stages of their disease would be useful in determining the 
best population in which to use ocrelizumab. The population was not stratified for disease activity. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/790835/2017 
     Page 131/180 
 
 
 
 
 
 
experts  considered  that  any  data  looking  into  a  potential  link  between  baseline  disease  activity  (in 
terms of clinical and MRI activity) and the observed clinical effect would be welcome. 
Of  note,  one  expert  considered  that  the  rationale  for  including  younger  patients  is  supported  as  in  a 
neurodegenerative disease like PPMS the target should be the “early” population where the expectation 
of achieving the best result is most prominent.  
Given the above considerations over the PPMS trial population, some experts considered that, despite 
the modest effect seen in the whole population, the positive results might be driven by a strong signal 
for efficacy in a sub-population of PPMS patients. These experts were of the positon that the observed 
effect could be relevant for a subpopulation of patients with PPMS, possibly dependent on the disease 
stage or the inflammatory activity. With regard to the results from the secondary outcomes, it was felt 
that they may be considered as supportive but should not be given confirmatory weight with regard to 
the expected proof of efficacy.  
Limitations  in  the  robustness  of  the  efficacy  data  were  mentioned.  In  particular,  the  differences 
between genders  with  respect to  the  results  for the  primary endpoint  were  noted,  (not  significant  for 
females  while  significant  for  males).  Similarly,  the  absence  of  significance  in  the  results  for  patients 
aged over 45 years was considered as a concern. 
Nonetheless,  it  was  acknowledged  that  the  study  was  not  powered  for  subgroup  analyses  and  thus 
results may be difficult to interpret with regards to patient selection/restriction of approval.  
The  SAG  experts  also  noted  that  the preferable,  more  conservative  significance  level  (P<0.01) in  the 
power  calculation  was  not  reached  and  agreed  that for  a  single pivotal trial  the  requirements  for this 
should be stricter than the demonstrated level of P<0.05. Based on this point, and on the very small 
effect  size,  one  expert  considered that the  WA  25046  study  cannot be  considered  as  fully  successful, 
despite  the  demonstrated  significance  level.  Some  experts  emphasized  that  in  a  slowly  progressive 
disease, using an ordinal scale such as the EDSS that mainly relies on motor function as a measure of 
efficacy;  a  large  effect  size  should  not  be  expected  during  the  proposed  observational  period  of  the 
clinical study.   
The  patient  representatives  supported  the  position  that  the  effect  size  is  small,  but  consistent  as  the 
results  from  most  of  the  secondary  endpoints  point  in  the  same  direction  and  they  represent  the 
important aspects of everyday life for the PPMS patient. Additionally, they stressed the importance of 
the  positive  effects  observed  in  the  HRQoL  (Health  Related  Quality  of  Life)  scales,  emphasising  that 
after  a  certain  level  of  progression  (EDSS~7.0)  the  effects  on  non-motor  aspects  of  disability  (e.g. 
cognition) become even more important than EDSS  progression.  
Regarding what may constitute a minimal clinically important difference (MCID), the SAG experts could 
not reach a consensus on a specific effect size in a relevant outcome measure that could be agreed as 
MCID  throughout  the  spectrum  of  PPMS.  The  patient  representatives  supported  the  position  that  any 
effect in this population should be considered relevant and important.  
2.  Having  in  mind  the  latest  scientific  developments  and  the  up-to-date  knowledge  about 
the  pathogenic  mechanisms  in  MS,  the  CHMP  would  like  to  ask  the  SAG  experts  whether 
there is a scientific/mechanistic rationale to use some of the available data from the SPMS 
patients  in  the  studies  in  Relapsing  MS  patients  as  supportive  in  the  context  of  the 
evaluation of the results from the study WA25046 in PPMS. 
The  SAG  experts  agreed  that  RMS  and  PPMS  are  more  likely  to  be  two  phenotypes  of  a  single 
pathological  process  rather  than  different  diseases.  However,  the  experts  were  divided  on  how 
supportive  the  RMS  data  are  in  the  present  case,  as  the  different  pathophysiological  components 
involved  in  RMS  and  PPMS,  although  similar,  may  nevertheless  differ  substantially  in  importance  and 
chronology.  Furthermore,  the  SAG  experts  considered  that  that  the  study  design  and  the  power 
calculation were likely to have been developed according to results from of other programmes that had 
failed,  increasing  the  number  of  patients  included  and  choosing  a  “time  to  event”  outcome  design  to 
Assessment report  
EMA/790835/2017 
     Page 132/180 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
increase the chances of showing a positive clinical effect for a slowly progressive disease such as PPMS 
on the EDSS scale.   
Most of the experts considered that the RMS data could not be supportive as PPMS – as usually defined 
in clinical practice - is such a distinct and specific MS phenotype that in the present case, generation of 
separate efficacy data in a more representative population is required.  
Other experts considered that the data from the RMS development programme for Ocrevus should be 
considered supportive as the different types of MS represent a disease continuum, rather than different 
diseases. This position was supported by the patient representatives. 
Finally, some of the experts considered that the Ocrevus RMS data could be considered as supportive 
for  efficacy  in  a  sub-group  of  PPMS  patients  with  proven  inflammatory  activity  (i.e.  the  younger 
population with more active disease). 
3. The CHMP  would like to ask the experts about their view on the  potential mechanism of 
action  of  ocrelizumab  in  PPMS,  and  how  do  they  see  the  results  in  trial  WA25046  in  the 
context of the failures of all the other programmes by drugs targeting similar epitopes. 
The majority of the SAG experts considered that the ocrelizumab trial in PPMS recruited a significantly 
different  cohort  of  PPMS  patients  compared  to  the  other  trials  in  this  population  and  to  the  patients 
usually  encountered  in  clinical  practice.  In  particular,  as  mentioned  above,  it  recruited  a  population 
consisting of younger patients with potentially more active disease than the “classic” PPMS population.  
As an additional comment, some experts noted the observed “cluster of malignancies” (breast cancer) 
registered in the development programme. They expressed the opinion that these data deserve to be 
considered  carefully  in  the  discussion  of  the  B/R  profile  of  the  product,  and  should  be  taken  into 
account  in  the  discussion  on  a  broad  vs  restricted  indication  in  the  PPMS  population  and  in  the  risk 
management plan and monitoring. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Confirmatory clinical efficacy data from two identically designed pivotal studies in RMS were provided. 
In  both  trials  the  primary  endpoint  and  most  secondary  endpoints  were  met.  The  effect  of  OCR 
treatment  in  the  RMS  patients  is  statistically  significant,  clinically  relevant,  and  consistent  across  the 
majority  of  study  endpoints.  During  the  assessment,  in  order  to  better  reflect  the  conclusions  on  the 
observed  efficacy  and  safety,  the  Applicant  narrowed  the  indication  to  “active  RMS”.  This  was 
considered acceptable as consistent efficacy had been shown in patients with active and highly active 
disease. 
The  development  programme  in  PPMS  consisted  of  a  single  pivotal  study.  The  primary  endpoint  and 
most of the secondary endpoints of the study were met. Most sensitivity analyses were in line with the 
primary analysis and give reassurance on the reliability of results.  Although results are not statistically 
compelling  for  an  application  based  on  one  single  pivotal  trial,  supportive  data  are  derived  from  the 
Olympus  trial,  which  support  that  a  subgroup  of  PPMS  patients  that  could  benefit  from  ocrelizumab 
treatment exists.   
The magnitude of the effect is indeed modest, smaller than what hypothesized in the calculation of the 
sample size. It should be however taken into account that the mechanism of action of ocrelizumab is 
anti-inflammatory in nature and that extraordinarily complex processes other than inflammation can be 
responsible  for  the  neurodegeneration  in  PPMS.  These  processes  may  become  predominant  in  more 
advanced  stages  of  the  diseases.  Moreover,  mechanisms  other  than  those  involving  B  cells  could 
participate to chronic inflammation, on which ocrelizumab may have no effect. Until our knowledge on 
Assessment report  
EMA/790835/2017 
     Page 133/180 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the pathology progresses further, it will indeed be difficult to successfully target all main pathological 
mechanisms that underline disease progression in PPMS. 
The clinical relevance of treatment effect cannot be denied, as a minimal clinical benefit cannot be 
defined at present and it is considered that any positive effect, even small, is of benefit as no other 
approved disease modifying treatments are available.  
The identification of the patient population that may benefit the most from the drug was based on the 
provided sub-group analyses. Despite their limitations, it is clear that subjects in the early stage of 
disease and with the presence of acute inflammation as per MRI activity tend to benefit more. This was 
the reason for the amended indication in PPMS patients with “early” disease.  
The  CHMP  agreed  with  the  Applicant’s  proposal  to  continue  investigating  the  long  term  safety  and 
efficacy in the whole PPMS population in a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study including 
also older (>55 years) patients and patients more advanced in their disease course. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Safety  data  from  a  total  of  2147  MS  patients  are  available  from  two  pivotal  Phase  III  studies  in 
relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) (WA21092 and WA21093), one Phase III study in primary 
progressive  multiple  sclerosis  (PPMS)  (WA25046),  and  a  supporting  dose-finding  Phase  II  study  in 
relapsing  remitting  MS  (RRMS)  (WA21493).    Ocrelizumab  doses  in  the  MS  program  ranged  between 
600 mg and 2000 mg, although in the pivotal Phase III studies only the 600 mg dose was used. 
Additional  supportive  safety  data  are  available  from  2926  patients  (7324  patients  years)  exposed  to 
ocrelizumab in a dose range of 20 mg to 2000 mg in a terminated development programme in patients 
with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Further safety data are available from a limited number of patients with 
Systemic  lupus  erythematosus  (SLE)  and  lupus  nephritis  (LN).  These  programmes  were  terminated 
due to similar safety issues (serious and opportunistic infections) and insufficient efficacy. 
Different process versions (0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 ), but the same formulation (formulation 2) of ocrelizumab 
were  used  in  the  phase  II  study  WA21493.  In  the  rest  of  the  phase  III  RMS  and  PPMS  studies 
presented  version  0.4  was  used.  However,  the  intended-to-market  version  is  1.0.  This  version  is 
currently  used  in  the  ongoing  open  label  extension.  In  addition,  in  the  RA  development  program 
versions 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 were used. Formulation 1 was also used in study WA18230 (Phase I/II, RA). 
Patient exposure 
In  order  to  provide  a  complete  assessment  of  the  safety  of  ocrelizumab  in  RMS  and  PPMS,  the  data 
was pooled and analyzed as described below. 
Pool A: Phase III RMS Controlled Treatment

Table 33 Overview of Safety Data Pools for the Ocrelizumab Clinical Development 
Program: 
At  least  1173  MS  patients  have  been  exposed  to  the  proposed  dose  600  mg  dose  for  more  than  95 
weeks.  
Demographics:  
•  RMS population 
Baseline demography and disease characteristics of the patients recruited into the two pivotal studies 
were matched across treatment groups and reflected an active RMS population. Patients were mainly 
white  (approximately  90%)  and  female  (approximately  two-thirds),  and  median  age  37-38  years. 
Around half of the patients had been diagnosed within 2 years, and almost all patients (96-98%) had 
experienced at least one relapse within 1 year, prior to randomization. Approximately 40% of patients 
had  one  or  more  T1  Gd  enhancing  lesions  at  baseline.  Patients  were  at  a  relatively  early  disability 
stage of RMS as evidenced by the median baseline EDSS scores of 2.5.  
• 
PPMS population 
Baseline demography and disease characteristics of the patients recruited into the study were matched 
across treatment groups and reflected a PPMS population. The population enrolled in the study showed 
comparable  proportions  of  patients  by  sex  (approximately  51%  male  and  49%  female),  which  is 
consistent  with  the  known  epidemiology  of  PPMS.  Other  baseline  characteristics  reflective  of  a  PPMS 
population, were mean age of approximately 45 years, mean EDSS approximately 4.7, and normalized 
brain volume of approximately 1467 cm3. No patients had any prior relapse. 
•  RA population 
The  majority  of  patients  were  female  (80%  of  patients)  and  white  (69.5%  of  patients).  The  median 
age  was  53  years  (range 18-90  years  and  median weight  was  72  kg  (range 28-200  kg).  The  median 
duration since RA diagnosis was 5.69 years and 8.1% of patients were MTX-Naïve at baseline. Biologic 
and non-biologic DMARDs had been previously received by 38.1% and 59.2% of patients, respectively, 
and 37.4% of patients had previously received anti-TNFs.

Adverse events 
The  most  common  AEs  by  PT  were  IRR,  headache,  influenza-like  illness,  upper  respiratory  tract 
infection, and nasopharyngitis.  Influenza-like illness, headache, injection site erythema, and injection 
site reaction were more frequently reported in the IFN group.  Infusion related reactions (IRRs), upper 
respiratory  tract  infection,  and  nasopharyngitis  were  more  common  in  the  ocrelizumab  group. 
Compared to placebo the same overall differences in frequencies of adverse events was observed.

Table  35  Overview  of  Safety  Profile  of  Ocrelizumab  during  Controlled  Treatment 
Period (Pool A and PPMS):  
Analysis of Adverse Events by Organ System or Syndrome 
Infusion related reactions (IRRs) 
To  reduce  the  risk  of  IRRs,  all  patients  (including  those  in  the  placebo  and  IFN  comparator  groups) 
received  IV  methylprednisolone  100  mg  prior  to  infusion.  The  addition  of  oral  antihistamine  to 
methylprednisolone pre-treatment for each dose was associated with at least a 2 − fold lower Incidence 
in IRRs compared with pre-treatment with methylprednisolone alone.  
In  all  MS  Phase  III  trials  the  initial  ocrelizumab  dose  of  600  mg  was  administered  as  a  divided  dose 
(two 300 mg infusions administered 14 days apart).  In the PPMS study administration of ocrelizumab 
continued as a divided dose (2 x 300 mg) regimen through the entire treatment period, whereas in the 
RMS  studies  subsequent  doses  were  administered  as  single  600  mg  infusions.  From  Dose  2  onwards 
there appears to be no benefit with regard to IRR for PPMS patients in administering ocrelizumab using 
the divided dose regimen (2 x 300 mg infusions, 14 days apart). 
The most common symptoms associated with IRRs in the OCR group (in  ≥ 10% of patients with IRRs) 
included pruritus, rash, throat irritation, and flushing. 
RMS population: 
IRRs  occurred  with  a  higher  incidence  in  patients  treated  with  ocrelizumab  compared  with  those 
receiving  IFN  (IFN  9.7%  of  patients  and  OCR  34.3%  of  patients).    The  higher  incidence  of  IRRs  in 
patients  receiving  ocrelizumab  was  most  evident  at  the  first  infusion  (Infusion  1,  Dose  1)  (IFN 6.5% 
versus  OCR  27.5%)  and  persisted  for  all  infusions,  albeit  with  decreasing  incidence  with  subsequent 
dosing. Overall, IRRs were reported in the highest proportion of patients (IFN 46.3% and OCR 80.6%) 
during the infusion or while the patient was still in the clinic. 
The majority of IRRs in both treatment groups (IFN 98.8% and IFN 92.6% of patients with IRRs) were 
of  Grade  1  or  2  in  intensity.    Grade  3  IRRs  were  reported  in  one  (0.1%)  patient  in  the  IFN  group 
compared with 20 (2.4% of patients) patients in the OCR group.   
PPMS population:  
Assessment report  
EMA/790835/2017 
     Page 137/180 
 
 
 
 
 
 
IRRs  in  the  PPMS  population  occurred  with  higher  incidence  in  patients  treated  with  ocrelizumab 
relative to those in the comparator group (placebo 25.5% of patients and OCR 39.9% of patients).  
There were 5 patients (1.0%) with a single occurrence of a serious IRR associated with an ocrelizumab 
infusion 
Infections 
The rate of infections was higher in RMS patients treated with ocrelizumab (84.5 per 100 patient years 
[PY])  compared  with  patients  treated  with  interferon  beta-1a  (67.8  per  100PY)  However,  the  rate  of 
serious infections in RMS patients treated with IFN was higher (1.79 events per 100PY) compared with 
patients treated with ocrelizumab (0.83 per 100PY). 
The rate of infections in PPMS patients treated with ocrelizumab was similar to the placebo group (71.7 
per  100PY  and  73.8  per  100PY,  respectively).  The  rate  of  serious  infections  in  PPMS  patients  was 
balanced between the placebo (2.88 per 100PY) and ocrelizumab (2.97 per 100PY) groups. This higher 
rate of serious infections in both arms of the PPMS study, compared with RMS patients, likely reflects 
the relative greater severity of PPMS. 
The majority of infections were of Grade 1 or 2 intensity. There were no fatal infections in RMS patients 
treated with ocrelizumab. In the PPMS study, fatal infection was reported in two patients (0.4%) in the 
ocrelizumab  group  during  the  controlled  treatment  period  (one  case  of  pneumonia  and  one  case  of 
pneumonia aspiration).  
Table  36  Serious  Infections  (broad  definition)  by  Outcome  –  Clinical  Studies  in 
Multiple Sclerosis: 
At  the  time  of  data  cut-off  there  were  no  opportunistic  infections  in  any  MS  patient  treated  with 
ocrelizumab  including  hepatitis  B  reactivation.  One  case  of  PML  has  been  reported  with  the  use  of 
ocrelizumab,  however,  the  patient  had  previously  been  treated  with  natalizumab.  No  fevers  of 
unknown  origin  were  identified.  No  disseminated  herpetic  infections  were  reported.  However,  herpes 
and candida infections did occur with slightly higher frequencies in the ocrelizumab groups than in the 
IFN and placebo groups.  
Association of Neutropenia with Infections 
Mean and median neutrophil levels did not change during treatment with ocrelizumab and the overall 
incidence of Grade 3 (<1.0-0.5 109 cells/µL) and Grade 4 (<0.5 109 cells/µL) neutropenia was low. 
Marked (i.e., changes from baseline below a certain threshold), low neutrophil counts was reported in 
a  higher  percentage  of  patients  in  the  OCR  group  compared  with  PBO  group  during  controlled 
treatment in PPMS patients (4.6% vs 1.7%) and a higher percentage of Grade 2 or above neutropenia 
was  seen  in  OCR  group  (4.3%,  21  patients)  compared  to  placebo  group  (1.3%,  3  patients).  Marked 
Assessment report  
EMA/790835/2017 
     Page 138/180 
 
 
 
 
 
low  neutrophil  counts  in  OCR  treated  patients  were  observed  with  similar  frequencies  also  in  OCR 
treated RMS population, Pool A (36 patients, 4.4%).  
In the Phase III MS all exposure population (modified Pool B) Grade 4 neutropenia was reported in 8 
ocrelizumab patients (2 in RMS, 5 in PPMS, and 1 in Phase 2 study WA21493 in RRMS) compared with 
none in the comparator (IFN/placebo) groups. 
Regarding prolonged neutropenia, the current available data in MS programs did not allow for a proper 
assessment  of  the  duration  of  the  decrease  in  neutrophil  counts  due  to  wide  intervals  of  scheduled 
assessments.  Caution  is  needed  as  the  review  of  the  neutropenic  SAEs  revealed  that  in  2  of  the  3 
cases the patients received GCSF treatment. GCSF treatment was for 2 SAEs (febrile neutropenia and 
agranulocytosis) in 2 PPMS patients. 
The  clinical  relevance  of  low  neutrophil  counts  in  relation  to  serious  infection  was  assessed  by 
comparing  the  rate  per  100PY  of  serious  infections  reported  during  the  episodes  when  neutrophil 
counts  were  confirmed  to  be  below  the  LLN  (<  1.96  x  109/L  for  at  least  two  consecutive 
measurements) and the rate of serious infection per 100PY when neutrophil counts were confirmed to 
be below the LLN.  Based on the results of these analyses, in the Phase III MS all exposure population 
(modified Pool B), an increase in the rate per 100PY of serious infections during confirmed neutrophils 
below  LLN  (3.24  [;  95%  CI:  0.39,  11.70)  was  observed  as  compared  with  those  without  confirmed 
neutrophils  below  LLN  (1.85  95%  CI:  1.49,  2.28).  Conversely,  no  association  with  serious  infections 
was observed in the decreased neutrophil counts in RMS and in PPMS controlled treatment population.  
The  rheumatoid  arthritis  OCR  development  program  indicated  a  higher  risk  of  neutropenia  with  OCR 
(OCR 400 mg: 6.2%; OCR 1000 mg: 7.4) compared to PBO (2.9%).

Infections in RA Studies and other populations 
In contrast to observations in the MS population, an imbalance in serious and opportunistic infections 
was observed in the RA population, including, but not limited to atypical pneumonia and pneumocystis 
jirovecii  pneumonia,  varicella  pneumonia,  tuberculosis  and  histoplasmosis.  In  rare  cases,  some  of 
these  infections  were  fatal.  The  rate  of  serious  infections  was  higher  in  the  immunosuppressant  plus 
ocrelizumab1000  mg  group  (7.28  per  100PY)  compared  with  the  immunosuppressant  plus  400  mg 
(5.18 per 100PY) or immunosuppressant plus placebo (3.99 per 100PY) group.

Serious infections were reported in 3 patients in the SLE trial (WA20499) and in 64 patients in the LN 
trial  (WA20500).    Among  the  3 patients  from  the  SLE  trial, two  patients  developed  opportunistic 
infections  (cytomegalovirus  [CMV]  retinitis  and  pneumocystis  jiroveci  pneumonia)  and  both  died  (due 
to  upper  respiratory  infection  and  pneumocystis,  respectively).    The  third patient  had  an  SAE  of 
pneumonia, which resolved without sequelae.  Among the 64 patients in the LN trial who developed a 
serious infection, eight patients died from the serious infection (due to Legionella infection, pneumonia, 
sepsis, urosepsis and septic shock).  
Of the 10 fatal infection cases, all patients were treated with concomitant immunosuppressants which 
likely contributed to their fatal outcome. 
Malignancies  
RMS Pool A 
The rate per 100PY of malignancy was 0.14 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.52) for the IFN group and 0.28 (95% CI: 
0.08,  0.71)  for  the  OCR  group.  These  were  reported  in  two  (0.2%  of  patients)  patients  in  the  IFN 
group (PTs of mantle cell lymphoma and squamous cell carcinoma) and 4 (0.6%) patients in the OCR 
group (PTs of renal cancer, malignant melanoma, and two cases of invasive ductal breast carcinoma). 
PPMS  
The  rate  per  100PY  of  malignancy  events  was  0.30  (95%  CI:  0.04,  1.10)  for  the  placebo  group  and 
0.92 (95% CI: 0.49, 1.57) for the OCR group.  
Table 38 Incidence Rates per 100PY of Malignancy in MS Patients (Pool B) 
Compared with Literature Reports: 
RA Population 
The  rate  per  100PY  of  malignancy  was  comparable  between  placebo  (1.11;  95% CI: 0.53,  2.04), 
OCR 400 mg(0.90; 95% CI: 0.41, 1.70) and OCR 1000 mg(1.32;  95% CI: 0.68, 2.31) groups. There 
was no other particular type of malignancy which occurred in more than 2 patients in any group. 
Autoimmune disorders 
Across the MS development program (Pool B), AEs related to autoimmune disorders were reported in 
12  patients  (0.6%)  receiving  OCR.  Multiple  sclerosis  was  the  most  common  autoimmune  disorder 
reported  as  an  AE  (0.3%,  7  patients)  with  few  reports  of  other  PTs  (single  cases  of  immune 
thrombocytopenic  purpura,  autoimmune  uveitis,  alopecia  areata  and  2  cases  of  autoimmune 
thyroiditis).

Deaths:  
Death was reported in 11 patients (3 patients who were receiving or had received placebo or IFN and 8 
patients  who  were  receiving  or  had  received  ocrelizumab).    In  Pool  A,  there  were  3  death  reported: 
two patients in the IFN group (suicide, mechanical ileus) and one patient in the OCR group (suicide). In 
PPMS during the controlled treatment period, there were 5 deaths reported: one patient (0.4%) in the 
placebo  group  (road  traffic  accident)  and  4  patients  (0.8%)  in  the  OCR  group  (pulmonary  embolism, 
pneumonia, pancreatic carcinoma metastatic, pneumonia aspiration).   
Laboratory findings 
RMS Pool A:  
The most common marked laboratory abnormalities were increases in liver enzymes including alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) which occurred at higher frequencies in 
the IFN than in the OCR group (ALT: IFN 17.7% and OCR 5.1% patients with abnormalities and AST: 
IFN 10.1% and OCR 2.2% patients with abnormalities.  
The proportion of patients with marked decreases in neutrophils was higher in the IFN (18.2%) than in 
the OCR (4.4%) group.  In the majority of patients in the OCR group, marked decreases in neutrophils 
were  single  occurrences  with  only  0.1%  of  patients  reporting  replicated  marked  decreases  in 
neutrophils.    In  the  IFN  group,  7.0%  of  patients  had  marked  decreases  in  neutrophils  that  were 
replicated.   
CD19+ B Cells  
Treatment  with  ocrelizumab  led  to  a  rapid  depletion  of  CD19+  B  cells  in  blood  with  near  complete 
depletion at Week 2. The median time to repletion (return to baseline or LLN, whichever was lower) of 
B cells was 72 weeks (range 27 to 175 weeks) after the last infusion.  
Other FACS Analyses (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD16+56+Cells) 
Following the first infusion of ocrelizumab, there was a small initial decrease in CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ 
T  cell  counts.    Thereafter,  mean  cell  counts  remained  stable  until  week  96.    Larger  decreases  were 
observed in the CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+T cell counts in the IFN group through 96 weeks.

There  was  no  impact  of  treatment  with  ocrelizumab  on  NK  lymphocyte  counts  across  the  controlled 
treatment period. Treatment with interferon beta-1a resulted in significant decreases in NK lymphocyte 
counts  at  Week  12,  which  then  stabilized  at  this  level  and  remained  stable  over  the  controlled 
treatment period. 
Immunoglobulins 
The  proportion  of  patients,  at  baseline,  reporting  IgG,  IgA  and  IgM  below  the  lower  limit  of  normal 
(LLN)  in  the  ocrelizumab  group  was  0.5%,  1.5%  and  0.1%  respectively.  Following  treatment,  the 
proportion of ocrelizumab-treated patients reporting IgG, IgA and IgM below the LLN at 96 weeks was 
1.5%, 2.4% and 16.5%, respectively.  
PPMS:  
The proportion of patients with marked increases in AST or ALT was similar to placebo. The proportion 
of patients that presented with markedly low levels of neutrophils was higher in the OCR group (4.6%) 
than in the placebo group (1.7%).  However, only 0.6% of ocrelizumab-treated patients (none in the 
placebo group) had markedly decreased levels of neutrophils that were replicated. 
The pattern was similar to the RMS Pool A population with regards to immunoglobulins, (CD3+, CD4+, 
CD8+,  CD16+56+-Cells),  and  CD19+  B  Cells,  except  placebo  did  not  have  an  effect  on  these 
parameters.   
Safety in special populations 
Weight 
The rate of adverse events and SAEs including infections were higher in patients with a baseline body 
weight ≥  75 kg.  
Age 
Ocrelizumab has not been studied in patients younger than 18 years and older than 55 years.  
Safety in Subgroups of Different Disease Activity 
The  adverse  event  profile  within  each  of  the  four  subgroups  was  consistent  with  the  adverse  event 
profile of the overall safety population. This includes the total number of patients who experienced an 
AE, SAE, or serious infection.

Concomitant Steroid Use (yes/no) 
The  rate  per  100PY  of  AEs  in  patients  who  received  steroids  was  higher  in  both  the  IFN  and  OCR 
groups.  Within each subgroup, the rate of AEs was similar between IFN and OCR treatments. 
In  the  OCR  group,  SAEs  were  reported  at  a  higher  rate  per  100PY  in  patients  receiving  steroid 
treatment (8.87; 95% CI: 5.74, 13.1) compared with those not on steroid treatment (4.55; 95% CI: 
3.41, 5.95).  In the IFN group, SAE rates were similar between steroid (6.82; 95% CI: 4.53, 9.86) and 
non-steroid (6.07; 4.63, 7.81) subgroups. In the OCR group, infections were also reported at a higher 
rate per 100PY in patients receiving steroid treatment (102; 95% CI: 91.0, 115) compared with those 
not  on  steroid  treatment  (81.3;  95%  CI:  76.2,  86.7).    In  the  IFN  group,  infection  rates  were  similar 
between steroid (76.7; 95% CI: 68.5, 85.7) and non-steroid (65.9; 95% CI: 60.9, 71.1) subgroups.  
When  patients  were  stratified  by  regional  subgroups  (EU/Switzerland/Norway,  Latin  America,  Non-
EU/Israel/Africa,  or  USA/Canada/Australia),  the  rate  per  100PY  of  AEs  was  highest  in  the 
USA/Canada/Australia subgroup compared with all other subgroups 
Diabetes (yes/no) 
The  rate  per  100PY  of  AEs  was  higher  in  diabetic  patients  (321;  95%  CI:  292,  352)  compared  with 
non-diabetic  patients  (251;  95%  CI:  247,  256).    There  was  also  a  higher  rate  of  SAEs  in  diabetic 
patients (12.6; 95% CI: 7.46, 19.9) compared with non-diabetic patients (6.79; 95% CI: 6.04, 7.62). 
Regional Subgroups 
When  patients  were  stratified  by  regional  subgroups  (EU/Switzerland/Norway,  Latin  America,  Non-
EU/Israel/Africa,  or  USA/Canada/Australia),  the  rate  per  100PY  of  AEs  was  highest  in  the 
USA/Canada/Australia subgroup compared with all other subgroups.  
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
Ocrelizumab  is  a  humanized  monoclonal  antibody  of  an  immunoglobulin  G1  subtype  and 
immunoglobulins are known to cross the placental barrier.  
B cell levels in human neonates following maternal exposure to ocrelizumab have not been studied in 
clinical  trials.    There  are  no  adequate  and  well-controlled  data  from  studies  in  pregnant  women; 
however transient peripheral B cell depletion and lymphocytopenia have been reported in infants born

to  mothers  exposed  to  other  anti-CD20  antibodies  during  pregnancy.  A  search  of  the  Roche  Global 
Safety Database using the pregnancy flag and the Standardized MedDRA Query (SMQ) Pregnancy and 
neonatal  topics  identified  a  total  of  46  patients  administered  at  least  one  OCR  infusion  who  became 
pregnant during clinical study participation (15 MS patients [1.1% of female patients in Pool B], 21 RA 
patients  [0.9%  of  female  patients  in  Pool  E],  and  10  LN  patients  [4.3%  of  female  LN  patients]).  An 
abnormal  pregnancy/  fetal  or  neonatal  finding  was  reported  in  20  cases.  This  includes  11  cases 
reporting a spontaneous fetal loss (spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, anembryonic pregnancy, or 
fetal  death)  in  10  patients  (since  one  patient  experienced  two  sequential  spontaneous  abortions  1.5 
years apart), and nine cases of premature delivery and/or an abnormal finding in a live born baby. The 
rates  of  spontaneous  foetal  loss  and  premature  birth  reviewed  in  this  dataset  were  similar  or  lower 
than the rates reported in the literature. 
In total, six cases with an abnormal finding in the baby were reported; among these, there were three 
cases  reporting  the  following  four  adverse  events  classified  as  a  structural  malformation:  small  renal 
cyst,  benign  nasopharyngeal  neoplasm,  congenital  positional  feet  contracture  and  limited  hips 
abduction.  As  regards  to  the  finding  reported  as  benign  nasopharyngeal  neoplasm,  since  neither  the 
results  of  the  histopathological  analysis  nor  a  final  diagnosis  was  provided,  a  full  assessment  of  this 
case is impossible. However, as the last OCR infusion was administered approximately 6 months prior 
to conception, this embryo/foetus is not considered to have been exposed to OCR in utero and a causal 
relationship  of  the  event  to  OCR  unlikely.  The  second  case  with  events  that  the  MAH  classified  as 
structural malformations reported a full term new born baby with congenital positional feet contracture 
and  limited  hips  abduction.  Conception  occurred  approximately  three  months  after  the  last  OCR 
infusion given for RA. The mother had concomitantly taken methotrexate, a known teratogen, (during 
four  weeks)  up  to  four  months  prior  to  the  conception.  Due  to  the  temporal  association,  the  MAH 
considers  it  unlikely  that  either  drug  played  a  contributory  role  for  the  abnormal  findings.  The  third 
case with a structural malformation is a report of a small renal cyst. Since the last OCR infusion for LN 
was administered three years before conception, this foetus is not considered in utero exposed to OCR 
and the event assessed as unrelated to OCR. Among the six cases reporting an abnormal finding in a 
live  born  baby,  there  was  a  case  of  infection  (sepsis)  in  a  newborn  baby.  Since  conception  occurred 
nearly 10 months after the last OCR dose, this foetus is not considered to have been transplacentally 
exposed to OCR. However, an embryo/foetus considered not transplacentally exposed to OCR may still 
be affected indirectly by the OCR induced B-cell depletion in the pregnant mother. The sixth case with 
an  abnormal  finding  was  a  normal  baby  with  low  birth  weight  (2.31  kg,  length  48.3  cm)  at  39-week 
gestation. CD-19 cell counts tested in the baby were not available in any of the reviewed cases. 
The  overall  rate  of  birth  defects  (defined  as  any  abnormality  affecting  body  structure  or  function),  in 
this  dataset  is  12.5%  (6/48),  which  is  higher  than  the  3.3%  reported  by  the  CDC  in  the  general 
population. No appropriate publications could be found in the literature that describes the rate of birth 
defects in MS, RA or SLE patients. The rate of events classified by the MAH as structural malformations 
in this dataset is 6.25% (3/48), which is higher than that reported for the general population (2–3%), 
but within the range of malformations reported in published studies in the MS population treated with 
other  DMTs.  However,  this  classification  may  be  very  conservative  and  it  is  of  note  that  none  of  the 
three  embryos/foetuses  are  considered  to  have  been  exposed  to  OCR  in  utero.  A  multi-source  non-
interventional  PASS  will  assess  and  characterize  pregnancy  and  infant  outcomes  of  women  with  MS 
exposed to OCR during the six months before the estimated date of conception or at any time during 
pregnancy.  
A  patient  (#1930433,  from  study  WA21093  site  209771,  PI:  Prof  Azra  Alajbegovie,  were  GCP  non

baby under unclear circumstances, and a report was duly filed with the Bosnian Competent Authority. 
Safety post last dose of OCR (Phase III MS All exposure, Pool B excluding Phase II 
There are limited data regarding safety post-last dose. Section 5.1 of the SmPC provides information 
on the long lasting pharmacodynamics effect of ocrelizumab and as such, the prescriber is presented 
with the knowledge currently available.

Hypersensitivity 
No cases fulfilled the criteria for anaphylactic reactions or DRESS. 
Antibody Titers 
Ocrelizumab did not appear to have an effect on specific humoral immunity to common bacterial and 
viral  antigens  over  the  96-week  study  period  (S. pneumonia,  mumps,  rubella,  varicella zoster).    The 
proportions  of  patients  with  positive  antibody  titers against  rubella,  mumps  and  varicella  at  Week  96 
were similar to the proportions at baseline. 
Anti-Drug Antibodies 
The  baseline  prevalence  of  ocrelizumab  ADAs  in  both  treatment  groups  was   < 1%,  and  the  titers  of 
these ADAs did not increase post treatment.

In  the  RMS  population,  0.4%  (3  patients)  showed  positive  (treatment-induced  and  –enhanced) 
ocrelizumab ADAs.  Of these, one patient tested positive for neutralizing antibodies to ocrelizumab.  No 
IRRs or other relevant adverse events such as hypersensitivity reactions were observed in the patient 
who developed neutralizing antibodies. 
In  the  PPMS  population  9  patients  (1.9%)  showed  positive  (treatment-induced  and  –enhanced) 
ocrelizumab ADAs. Of these, one patient tested positive for neutralizing antibodies to ocrelizumab.  The 
patient who developed neutralizing antibodies did not experience an IRR or hypersensitivity reactions. 
Nine  patients  (3.8%)  in  the  placebo  group  tested  ADA  positive  for  ocrelizumab  post-baseline.    These 
results  reflect  the  fact that  the  ADA  tests  were  designed  to  have  an  untreated  positive  rate of  5% in 
the screening assay and 1% in the confirmatory assay. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No  formal  drug-drug  interaction  studies  have  been  performed,  as  no  drug-drug  interactions  are 
expected  via  the  CYP  and  other  metabolizing  enzymes  or  transporters  for  a monoclonal  antibody  like 
ocrelizumab. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
RMS Pool A 
The incidence was higher in the IFN group (6.2%; 51 patients) compared with the OCR group (3.5%; 
29 patients). The primary AEs leading to withdrawal reported with a higher incidence in the IFN group 
were  influenza-like  illness,  fatigue,  injection  site  reaction,  liver  function  test  abnormalities,  and 
abnormalities  in  creatine  phosphokinase  levels  (increased)  or  in  platelet  or  leukocyte  counts, 
neutropenia or leukopenia. 
In  the  OCR  group,  the  primary  AE  leading  to  withdrawal  occurring  with  a  higher  incidence  compared 
with IFN was IRR; reported in 11 patients in the OCR group and none in the IFN group. 
PPMS 
The proportion of patients withdrawn from study treatment due to an AE was similar between groups 
(placebo  3.3%  and  OCR  4.1%).    The  primary  AEs  by  SOC  leading  to  withdrawal  were  balanced 
between  the  placebo  and OCR  group  with  the  exception  neoplasm  Benign,  Malignant  and  Unspecified 
(placebo 1 patient [0.4%] and OCR 7 patients [1.4%]), infections and Infestations (placebo 3 patients 
[1.3%]  and  OCR  4 patients  [0.8%]).  AEs  in  all  other  SOCs  were  balanced  between  the  placebo  and 
OCR  groups.  The  AEs  leading  to  withdrawal  by  PT  reported  in  more  than  one  patient  were  invasive

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
A sufficiently large safety database is available. It includes 825 RMS patients from two pivotal Phase 3 
studies  (1448  patient  years  of  exposure,  Pool  A);  486  PPMS  patients  from  one  pivotal  Phase  3  study 
(1416  patient  years  of  exposure;  PPMS)  and  2147  patients  in  the  MS  all  exposure  population  which 
also  includes  a  Phase  2  study  in  RMS  patients  and  the  open-label  extension  periods  of  the  studies 
mentioned (4485 patient years of exposure; Pool B). At least 1173 MS patients have been exposed to 
the  proposed  dose  600  mg  dose  for  more  than  95  weeks.  However,  long-term  exposure  data  do  not

allow conclusive evaluation of the risk of malignancies as well as rare risks, such as PML. The RMS and 
PPMS  patient  population  included  in  the  controlled  MS  trials  is  a  selected  patient  population,  not 
entirely representative of the MS patient population target of the two claimed indications. For instance 
median age of PPMS enrolled patients was 46 years and the baseline EDSS score of patients included 
in the studies was up to 6.5 in PPMS and 5.5 in RMS.  Patients with a history of recurrent or chronic 
infections or immunodeficiency, and patients with a history of ischemic cerebrovascular disorders were 
excluded.  Cardiovascular  disease  was  not  among  exclusion  criteria,  but  there  was  only  one  enrolled 
patient with a history of cardiovascular disease (SMQ cardiac failure).  
There is no information regarding patients older than 55 years.  The absence of safety data in patients 
≥55  years  of  age  requires  a  more  cautious  approach  with  regard  to  the  observed  imbalance  in 
malignancies, including breast cancer, observed in OCR-treated patients relative to comparator (IFN or 
placebo), as it is well known that the risk of malignancies increases with age.  
Additional  supportive  safety  data  are  available  from  2926  patients  (7324  patients  years)  exposed  to 
ocrelizumab in a dose range of 20 mg to 2000 mg in a terminated development programme in patients 
with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Further safety data are available from a limited number of patients with 
Systemic  lupus  erythematosus  (SLE)  and  lupus  nephritis  (LN).  These  programmes  were  terminated 
due similar safety issues (serious and opportunistic infections) and insufficient efficacy. Following CHMP 
request, the Applicant  extensively discussed possible explanations for the unfavourable safety profile 
observed in the ocrelizumab RA clinical development program compared to rituximab, which is used in 
clinical  practice  in    combination  with  methotrexate  in  the  same  setting  as  the  one  of  ocrelizumab  RA 
Phase  III  trials  [treatment  of  adult  patients  with  severe  active  rheumatoid  arthritis  who  have  had  an 
inadequate  response  or  intolerance  to  other  disease-modifying  anti-rheumatic  drugs  (DMARD) 
including  one  or  more  tumour  necrosis  factor  (TNF)  inhibitor  therapies].  The  Applicant  stated  that 
given the many differences between the OCR and RTX RA development programs (including differences 
in  patient  populations,  use  of  concomitant  medications,  functional  differences  between  the  two 
molecules [conferring different activity in vitro], and dose and dose regimen differences), it is difficult 
to draw any definitive conclusions in regard to the different safety profiles. Even though both RTX and 
OCR  target  CD20,  these  are  different  molecules,  with  functional  differences  [conferring  different 
activity  in  vitro].  These  differences  between  RTX  and  OCR  warrant  a  cautious  approach  in  using  the 
rituximab  clinical  data  to  exclude  the  relevance  of  safety  issues  that  emerged  from  the  OCR  clinical 
development  program,  such  as  the  imbalance  in  malignancies  between  the  active  and  the  control 
group.  
Comparing ocrelizumab to IFN treatment, the discontinuation rate was lower in the ocrelizumab group 
(3.5%) than in the IFN group (6.2%). The number of patients to experience an AE including a serious 
adverse event was similar in the IFN beta-1a group and the ocrelizumab group. As expected adverse 
event  such  as  influenza  like  symptoms,  injection  site  reactions,  myalgia,  pruritus,  increased  hepatic 
transaminase  and  headache  were  common  in  the  IFN  beta-1a  group  and  occurred  more  frequently 
than in the ocrelizumab group. 
In  the  PPMS  trial,  slightly more  patients  experienced  adverse  events  in  the  ocrelizumab  compared to 
placebo (95% vs. 90%). The frequency of adverse events by Grade were similar in the two treatment 
groups. The rate of discontinuation was slightly higher in the ocrelizumab group compared to placebo. 
Analysis of safety in subgroups with different disease activity did not show any difference, although the 
number of events in some subgroups were low which precludes firm conclusions.  
The main safety issues with the use of ocrelizumab are infusion related reactions (IRR), an increased 
risk  of  infections  and  a  higher  frequency  of  malignancies  in  the  ocrelizumab  groups.  IRRS  occurred 
more  frequently  in  the  ocrelizumab  group  (34.3%-39.9%)  compared  to  IFN  (9.7%)  and  placebo 
(25.5%).  All  patients  were  pretreated  with  100  mg  methylprednisolone  to  reduce  the  risk  of  IRRs. 
Patients  who  also  received  antihistamines  had  a  twofold  reduced  risk  of  IRRs.  Pretreatment  with 
antihistamines is considered mandatory. The IRR symptoms observed with ocrelizumab treatment were 
primarily pruritus, rash, throat irritation and flushing. Most were Grade 1 or 2 in intensity and only one 
patients  had  a  Grade  4  IRR  in  the  RMS  studies.  There  were  5  serious  IRRs  in  the  PPMS  study.  Most 
Assessment report  
EMA/790835/2017 
     Page 150/180 
 
 
 
 
IRRs  occurred  with  the  first  infusion  and  the  incidence  subsequently  decreased.  Splitting  the  600  mg 
dose  into  two  with  a  two  weeks  separation  in  the  PPMS  trial  did  not  reduce  the  overall  risk  of  IRRs. 
Most IRRs were manageable which is reflected in the discontinuation rate; 0.4% in the PPMS trial and 
1.3%  in  the  RMS  studies  discontinued  due  to  IRRS  in  the  ocrelizumabs  groups.  In  most  IRR  events 
(78% in the Phase 3 RMS controlled treatment population, Pool A and in 77% in PPMS) symptomatic 
therapy  for  the  management  of  IRR  symptoms  in  addition  to  the  slow  down  or  interruption  of  the 
infusion  was  administered.  In  the  remaining  22%  of  the  IRR  events  in  Pool  A  (23%  in  PPMS)  no 
additional intervention was necessary and the slow down or interruption of the infusion was sufficient 
to resolve the IRR event. The need to reduce the infusion rate in case of IRR is adequately reflected in 
the SmPC in section 4.2. 
Muscle spasticity was observed in one case of serious IRR. However, muscle spasticity as a symptom of 
IRR  was  only  reported  in  2  PPMS  patients  as  of  20  January  2016,  across  all  PPMS,  RMS  and  RA 
populations, thus it was concluded not to consider muscle spasticity as a true symptom of IRR. During 
the controlled treatment period 12 patients were ADA positive and two patients also tested positive for 
neutralizing  antibodies.  The  information  provided  in  the  SmPC  for  the  prescriber,  that  the  impact  of 
treatment-emergent  ADAs  on  safety  and  efficacy  cannot  be  assessed  given  the  low  incidence  of  ADA 
associated with Ocrevus is considered adequate. 
Infections  occurred  more  frequently  (rates  per  100PY)  with  ocrelizumab  (85.4;  95%  CI:  80.7,  90.3) 
than  with  IFN  (69.1;  95%  CI:  64.8,  73.5).  The  largest  difference  was  seen  in  viral  infections,  26.5% 
vs.  20.5%,  although  bacterial  infections  also  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  ocrelizumab  group, 
21.6%  vs.  18.6%.  However,  serious  infections  including  non-serious  infection  requiring  IV  anti-
infective  treatment  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  IFN  group,  3.8%  vs.  1.8%  in  the  ocrelizumab 
group,  and  was  primarily  of  bacterial  origin.  While  the  rate  of  serious  infections  in  the  overall  RMS 
population  was  higher  in  patients  treated  with  IFN  (1.79  events  per  100  PY)  compared  with  patients 
treated  with  OCR  (0.83  per  100  PY),  in  the  subgroup  of  subjects  with  lymphocytes  confirmed  to  be 
<LLN  (defined  as  counts   <  LLN  for  at  least  2  consecutive  measurements),  higher  rates  of  serious 
infections were observed in OCR treated patients (4.22) compared to IFN treated patients (0). 
Similarly to what was observed in the RMS population, while the rate of serious infections in the overall 
PPMS  population  was  similar  in  patients  treated  with  OCR  (2.97  events  per  100  PY)  and  in  patients 
treated  with  PBO  (2.88  per  100  PY),  in  the  subgroup  of  subjects  with  lymphocytes  confirmed  to  be 
<LLN,  higher  rates  of  serious  infections  were  observed  in  OCR  treated  patients  (7.93)  compared  to 
PBO treated patients (0). 
Even  though  the  number  of  events  is  low,  and  thus  the  confidence  intervals  partially  overlap,  these 
data have a strong biological plausibility: in patients that are B cell depleted, if also the overall number 
of lymphocytes decrease, these patients are at increased risk of infections. 
Furthermore,  more  patients  in  the  ocrelizumab  group  experienced  Grade  4  (1.6%  vs.  0.4%),  and 
Grade  5  (death)  (0.4%  vs.  0%) infections.  The  higher  frequency  of  life threatening  serious  infections 
and  of  serious  infection  leading  to  death  in  OCR  treated  patients  compared  to  comparators  was 
confirmed in the 3-month safety update (CCOD 20 January 2016) (OCR: 12/ 1311, 0.9% vs PBO/IFN: 
1/1065, 0.09%). A worse outcome of serious infections is a concern with a B cell depleting therapy, as 
it is well known that in a real world setting a higher frequency of serious infection will be observed, and 
this  will  potentially  lead  to  a  higher  mortality.  The  Applicant  has  introduced  a  specific  warning 
statement  in  the  SmPC  regarding  increased  risk  of  life-threatening  infections  associated  with  the 
development/presence of dysphagia. It is noteworthy that the rate of infections leading to withdrawal 
was  slightly  lower  in  the  ocrelizumab  group  than  in  the  placebo  group.  This  means  that  that  most  of 
the infections which occur with ocrelizumab use is not treatment limiting.    
Opportunistic infections, herpes and candida infections, in the RMS studies occurred more frequently in 
the ocrelizumab group. The overall rate of events per 100PYwas 2.79 (95% CI: 1.98, 3.81) in the IFN 
group and 5.25 (95% CI: 4.14, 6.57) in the ocrelizumab group. However, in the PPMS trial the overall 
rate of events per 100PY was 3.03 (95% CI: 1.85, 4.68) in the placebo group and 2.33 (95% CI: 1.60, 
3.27)  in  the  ocrelizumab  group.    There  were  no  hepatitis  B  reactivation.  One  case  of  PML  has  been 
reported  with  the  use  of  ocrelizumab,  however,  the  patient  had  previously  been  treated  with

natalizumab  In  one  case  of  neutropenic  sepsis  available  data  do  not  allow  neither  to  confirm  nor  to 
exclude the opportunistic nature of the event due to insufficient information. 
At  the  CCOD  for  the  3-month  safety  update,  the  incidence  of  serious  infection  (including  non-serious 
infections requiring IV antiinfectives) in Pool C (Phase 3 RMS All Exposure population), increased from 
2.1% (37 events in 31 patients reported in the ISS) to 3.5% (62 events in 51 patients). This increase 
was due primarily to more serious pneumonia events reported in 7 additional patients. Increased rates 
of serious infection were observed in RMS patients and in Pool B over time (beginning at Dose 5). To 
assess  if  the  increase  in  serious  infection  over time was  related  to  duration  of  ocrelizumab  exposure, 
the rate of serious infection was assessed in those Pool C patients who were initially randomized to the 
OCR  group  before  entering  open-label  ocrelizumab  treatment  compared  with  those  patients  initially 
randomized to the IFN group who began open-label ocrelizumab treatment after completion of the 96-
week  controlled  treatment  period.  By  dose,  the  rate  of  serious  infection  increased,  specifically 
beginning  at  Dose  5,  in  those  patients  initially  randomized  to  the  OCR  group.  In  those  patients 
randomized  to  the  IFN  group,  the  rates  of  serious  infection  remained  stable  over  time  and  similar  to 
those  reported  with  Dose  1  through  Dose  3  in  patients  randomized  to  the  OCR  group  in  the  ISS.  An 
increase  in  the  rate  of  serious  infections  was  observed  in  RMS  between  Years  2  and  3,  but  not  in 
subsequent years. No increase was observed in PPMS.  
Neutropenia  (including  prolonged  neutropenia)  is  listed  as  an  important  identified  risk  for  rituximab. 
Marked  low  neutrophil  counts  was  reported  in  a  higher  percentage  of  patients  in  the  OCR  group 
compared with PBO group during controlled treatment in PPMS patients (4.6% vs 1.7%) and a higher 
percentage of Grade 2 or above neutropenia was seen in OCR group (4.3%, 21 patients) compared to 
placebo group (1.3%, 3 patients). Marked low neutrophil counts in OCR treated patients were observed 
with  similar  frequencies  also  in  the  RMS  controlled  treatment  population  (36  patients,  4.4%).  In  the 
Phase  III  MS  all  exposure  population  (modified  Pool  B)  Grade  4  neutropenia  was  reported  in  8 
ocrelizumab patients (2 in RMS, 5 in PPMS, and 1 in Phase 2 study WA21493 in RRMS) compared with 
none in the comparator (IFN/ placebo) groups. In the Phase III MS all exposure population (modified 
Pool B), an increase in the rate per 100PY of serious infections during confirmed neutrophils < LLN (<  
1.96 x 109/L for at least two consecutive measurements) (3.24 [; 95% CI: 0.39, 11.70) was observed 
compared  with  without  confirmed  neutrophils  <  LLN  (1.85    95%  CI:  1.49,  2.28).  Conversely,  no 
association  with  serious  infections  was  observed  in  the  decreased  neutrophil  counts  in  RMS  and  in 
PPMS  controlled  treatment  population.  Also  the  rheumatoid  arthritis  OCR  development  program 
indicated a higher risk of neutropenia with OCR (OCR 400 mg: 6.2%; OCR 1000 mg: 7.4) compared to 
PBO (2.9%). Regarding prolonged neutropenia, the current available data in MS programs do not allow 
a  proper  assessment  of  the  duration  of  the  decrease  in  neutrophil  counts  due  to  wide  intervals  of 
scheduled assessments. Caution is needed as the review of the neutropenic SAEs revealed that in 2 of 
the 3 cases the patients received GCSF treatment. GCSF treatment was for 2 SAEs (febrile neutropenia 
and agranulocytosis) in 2 PPMS patients. In light of the above, a statement regarding neutrophils has 
been amended to section 4.8 of the SmPC and neutropenia has been included in the Table of adverse 
reactions..  In  the  majority  of  patients,  IgM  levels  decreased  significantly.  There  was  only  a  slight 
transient decrease in IgA and IgG levels. IgM levels appear to be normalised in the majority of patients 
within 24 weeks based on data from the Phase II study.  In Pool B (MS All exposure) rates of serious 
infections per 100PY in patients with levels of IgA, IgG and IgM below the LLN at any timepoint were 
higher  than  the  rate  in  the  overall  population,  even  though  the  limited  number  of  cases  and  the 
limitations  of  the  method  due  to  the  visits  schedule,  do  not  allow  to  draw  definitive  conclusions. 
Decrease in serum immunoglobulins (Ig) has appropriately been added as an important identified risk. 
Other  risks  associated  with  development  of  infections  were  high  BMI  and  previous  infections.  There 
was  no  impact  on  NK  lymphocyte  count  in  the  ocrelizumab  groups.  In  the  IFN  group,  there  was  a 
decrease in CD3+, CD4+  and CD8+T cell count as  well as NK lymphocyte count. CD19+  B cell count 
was  near  complete depletion  at  Week  2  and  the  median  time to  repletion  (return  to  baseline or  LLN, 
whichever  was  lower)  of  B  cells  was  72  weeks  (range  27  to  175  weeks)  after  the  last  infusion.  In  all 
safety  Pools,  following  the  first  infusion  of  OCR,  there  was  a  decrease  in  mean  levels  of  the  different 
subsets of T cells (CD3, CD4, CD8). After this initial decrease, levels of these T cell subsets remained 
stable with small fluctuations throughout treatment. In order to better understand the possible clinical 
relevance of the observed decrease in subsets of T cells (CD3, CD4, CD8), following CHMP request to

provide all available data on the possible correlation between serious infections and outcome of serious 
infections  and  decrease  in  T  cells  (CD3,  CD4  and  CD8)  ,  the  Applicant  conducted  an  analyses  on  the 
association  between  confirmed  drops  in  T  cells  below  LLN  over  two  consecutive  measurements  and 
serious  infections;  this  analyses  showed  that  decreases  in  CD4  and  CD8  T  cells  below  the  LLN  were 
associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  serious  infections  within  MS  ocrelizumab  treated  patients, 
compared to patients without CD4 and CD8 T cells below the LLN.  Even though the number of events 
is  low,  and  thus  the  confidence  intervals  partially  overlap,  these  data  have  a  strong  biological 
plausibility:  in  patients  that  are  B  cell  depleted,  if  also  T  cells  are  decreased,  these  patients  are  at 
increased  risk  of  infections.  Similar  findings  were  observed  also  for  confirmed  low  lymphocyte  counts 
(defined  as  counts  <LLN  for  at  least  2  consecutive measurements):    higher  rate  of  serious  infections 
were  observed  in  patients  with  confirmed  low  lymphocyte  counts  compared  to  patients  without 
lymphocyte  counts  <LLN.  From  the  above,  it  appears  that  measuring  lymphocyte  counts  can  be  a 
method to identify OCR treated patients at increased risk of serious infection. The Applicant accepted 
to add a paragraph on Lymphocyte counts in paragraph 4.8 of the SmPC, in the section description of 
selected adverse reaction/ Laboratory abnormalities.    
The  risk  of  serious  infections  and  opportunistic  infections  in  the  MS  population  differ  from  RA 
population.  In  the  RA  studies,  the  risk  of  serious  infections  and  opportunistic  infections  was  clearly 
increased.  The  opportunistic  infections  included  herpes  and  candida  infection,  which  were  also 
disseminated  in  some  cases,  tuberculosis,  pneumocystis  jiroveci,  histoplasmosis  and  hepatitis  B. 
However, the RA and MS population differ. The RA population was on average older, had different co-
morbidities,  higher  doses  of  ocrelizumab  was  used  in  some  patients  and  they  were  also  treated  with 
DMARDs 
the  SLE  and  LN  populations  concomitant 
immunosuppression was also used which resulted in a high frequency of serious infections. 6% (SLE) 
and 3% (LN) of the patients enrolled in these studies died due to an infection. 
immunosuppressants. 
i.e.  other 
In 
Concomitant steroid use for MS relapse was associated with a higher frequency of adverse event 
including infections. Following CHMP request, the Applicant has presented analyses taking into account 
the temporal association between the use of corticosteroids and the onset of infections allowing only a 
temporal window for infections from the onset of MS relapse to 30 days after the end of the relapse. 
With this analysis, within the OCR group, higher rates of infections or serious infections were not 
observed in the subgroup of MS relapses treated with corticosteroids compared with the subgroup of 
MS relapses not treated with corticosteroids.  It cannot be excluded due to small numbers, that there 
is an increased risk of infections when using concomitant glucocorticosteroids for symptomatic 
treatment of relapses. This is appropriately reflected in the SmPC. 
 Across both RMS and PPMS indications of the Phase III pivotal clinical trials with Ocrelizumab in MS, a 
total of 15 patients received prior DMTs other than IFN and GA. For all these patients, the time elapsed 
from the end of DMT until the start of OCR were in line with the protocol requirements as per the 
exclusion criteria. Available data do not allow any evaluation of the possible additive immune effect 
that could occur when switching patients from another DMT with immunosuppressive effect to OCR, 
possibly leading to a worse safety profile.  The pharmacodynamics of other disease modifying MS 
therapies should be taken into consideration when prescribing OCR, which is reflected  in Section 4.4 of 
the SmPC. 
In  light  of  the  relevance  of  gathering  additional  safety  data  on  OCR  safety  in  patients  previously 
treated with a DMT with immunosuppressive effect, the Applicant committed to collect information on 
type and duration of DMT used prior to switching to OCR in the post–authorization safety study (PASS) 
on long-term surveillance of MS patients treated with OCR. 
There is a higher frequency of malignancies in the  ocrelizumab groups compared to IFN and placebo; 
rate of malignancy per 100PY, ocrelizumab RMS 0.28 (95% CI: 0.08, 0.71) vs. IFN 0.14 (95% CI: 
0.02, 0.52) and ocrelizumab PPMS 0.92 (95% CI: 0.49, 1.57) vs. placebo 0.30 (95% CI: 0.04, 1.10). 
The difference appear to primarily driven by more cases of breast cancer in the ocrelizumab groups. 
There were no cases of breast cancer in the IFN or placebo groups whereas there were 3 cases in the 
RMS ocrelizumab group and 4 cases in the PPMS ocrelizumab group. One further case of breast cancer 
Assessment report

occurred in a RRMS patient from study WA21493 (treated with OCR 2000 mg) and one further case of 
breast cancer occurred in a patient switched to OCR in the open label phase of study WA21093. 
Even  though  this  pattern  was  not  seen  in  the  RA  population,  the  RA  ocrelizumab  programme  is  not 
considered  adequate  to  evaluate  a  long-term  risk.  In  the  RA  ocrelizumab  development  program  the 
median number of ocrelizumab doses received by the patients was only 2 in the controlled treatment 
period  and  only  3  in  the  uncontrolled  pool.  Of  note,  one  case  of  male  breast  cancer  was  reported 
(Patient  WA20495-141462-90803)  in  a  67  year  old Japanese  male  previously  treated  with  infliximab, 
diagnosed  with  breast  cancer  one  year  after  the  start  of  the  treatment  with  OCR  200  mg.  Breast 
cancer is a very rare disease in males. 
 Age-standardised  comparison  of  incidence  rates  of  breast  cancer  revealed  that  compared  to 
epidemiological data the 95% confidence intervals overlapped. Furthermore, with additional data as of 
30 June 2016 the standardized incidence rate per 100PY of female breast cancer was 0.227 (95% CI: 
0.096, 0.498).  This rate was consistent with that reported at the 20 January 2016 CCOD (0.240; 95% 
CI: 0.096, 0.544) and with that reported in the SCS (0.281; 95% CI: 0.104, 0.666). The results across 
all  CCODs  remained  within  the  95%  CIs  for  the  standardized  incidence  rates  reported  for  the  SEER 
database  (0.124;  95%  CI:  0.124,  0.125).  This  could  indicate  that  the  risk  is  not  higher  than  in  the 
general population.  
Baseline  risk  factors  for  the  development  of  breast  cancer  other  than  age  and  gender  was  not 
recorded.    The  suppression  of  B-cells  lasted  for  more  than  2  years.  B  cells  are  known  to  play  a 
significant role in tumor surveillance; however, there is conflicting evidence as how it influences tumor 
development.  Non-clinical  xenograft  models  (breast  cancer)  suggest  that  B  cell  depletion  slow  tumor 
progression while other xenograft models have been associated with enhanced tumor growth. Available 
data do not allow to definitely confirm nor rule out a causal relationship between B cell depletion and 
the development of the specific subtypes of breast cancers observed in the ocrelizumab trials.   
Furthermore, 11 years of follow-up data for rituximab, which is also a CD20 monoclonal antibody, do 
not seem to suggest any increased risk of malignancy.  However, also this argumentation may not be 
considered conclusive, because even though both rituximab and OCR target CD20, these are different 
molecules that may carry different safety profiles. 
The Applicant has proposed a post-marketing Long-Term Surveillance of Ocrelizumab-Treated Patients 
with Multiple Sclerosis study. In the PASS study, baseline and on-treatment tumour surveillance should 
be  planned.  This  should  be  able  to  clarify  if  ocrelizumab  is  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of 
malignancies including breast cancer. 
As requested, in section 4.4, in the subparagraph ”Malignancies” of the proposed SmPC, information on 
the  imbalances  observed  compared  to  placebo,  including  the  cluster  in  breast  cancer,  has  been 
provided. The need to exclude from treatment patients with active malignancy and perform individual 
benefit risk assessment in patients with known risk factors for malignancies or  actively monitored for 
recurrence of malignancy  has also been included.  
There  were  three  deaths  in  the  RMS  trials,  two  in  the  IFN  group  and  one  in  the  ocrelizumab  group. 
None were considered related to the treatments. In the PPMS trial group 1 patient in the placebo group 
died (road traffic accident). In the ocrelizumab group 4 patients (0.8%; AE PTs of pulmonary embolism, 
pneumonia,  pancreatic  carcinoma  metastatic,  pneumonia  aspiration)  died.  Two  of  the  cases  in  the 
ocrelizumab group (pneumonia cases) could have been related to ocrelizumab.   
Three  additional  deaths  were  reported  after  the  SCS  up  to  30  September  2016,  all  3  considered 
unrelated  to  study  drug  by  the  investigator:  one  case  of  adenocarcinoma  of  the  oesophagus  (in  a 
52-year  old  female),  one  case  of  acute  coronary  insufficiency  (in  a  patient  with  multiple  CV  risk 
factors) and one event with an unknown cause of death (40 years old male, from a site in Switzerland; 
the  patients  was  found  dead  in  his  residence;  according  to  the  first  results  the  death  was  due  to  an 
epileptic event; as per the “Forensic medical assessment of death” report, the cause of death remains 
unclear  after  autopsy,  although  an  epileptic  seizure  process  with  consequent  failure  of  central 
regulation was conceivable.   
The Applicant clarified that the term Crohn’s disease is not part of the narrow basket to detect immune 
disorders (ocrelizumab specific MedDRA Term selection, that contains approximately 100 PTs) used by 
the  Applicant  for  the  Summary  of  Clinical  Safety.  However,  the  PT  Crohns  disease  is  part  of  the 
standard  MedDRA  Query  (SMQ)  “Pre-malignant  tumours  (narrow)”  which  was  used  to  detect  pre-
Assessment report

malignancies,  and  using  this  basket  one  case  of  Crohn  disease  was  identified  at  the  Summary  of 
Clinical  Safety  CCOD.  With  the  3  months  safety  update  submitted  with  this  response  (with  a  cut-off 
date  of  20  Jan  2016),  3  new  cases  of  Crohn’s  disease  were  detected  (cumulatively  4/2279 patients 
exposed to OCR, 0.2%).  
The  Applicant  states  that  the  limited  information  available  for  these  3  new  cases,  precludes  an 
evaluation of whether or not the disease might have been pre-existent. In order to increase sensitivity 
to  detect  a  potential  signal  of  autoimmune  diseases  associated  with  ocrelizumab  treatment,  a  broad 
basket  of  approximately  400  terms    was  applied;  in  addition  to  the  four  cases  of  Crohn’s  disease 
mentioned  above,  four  more  cases  mapping  to  the  System  Order  Class  (SOC)  Gastrointestinal 
Disorders (one case of ulcerative colitis and three cases of chronic gastritis) were identified by applying 
the broad screening basket for autoimmune diseases in the ocrelizumab all exposure population as of 
the  20  January  2016  CCOD  (for  the  3-month  safety  update).    The  proportion  of  patients  with  AEs 
related  to  autoimmune  disorders  identified  with  the  broad  basket  to  detect  immune  disorders  at  the 
CCOD  for  the  3  months  safety  update  in  Pool  B  was  5.0%  (114  patients).  The  event  rate  of 
autoimmune  disorders  (broad  basket)  per  100  patient-years  observed  with  ocrelizumab  in  MS  (2.22; 
95% CI: 1.85, 2.65) falls within the range reported in placebo-exposed patients in other MS studies (0 
to  5.48;  95%  CI:  3.85,  7.12).  In  order  to  better  evaluate  a  potential  signal  of  autoimmune  diseases 
associated  with  ocrelizumab  treatment,  the  frequencies  of  autoimmune  diseases  (using  the  broad 
basket of approximately 400 terms) in OCR  MS controlled pools (Pool A and PPMS) was provided by 
the  Applicant.  At  present,  there  is  insufficient  data  to  warrant  inclusion  of  autoimmune  disorders  in 
general, or of any particular autoimmune disorder in the ocrelizumab SmPC. Autoimmune disorders will 
be monitored though routine pharmacovigilance in upcoming PSURs. 
The Applicant has been requested to further discuss the possible reasons for the higher rates of AEs, 
SAEs and infections reported in patients from the USA region. No definitive conclusion may be drawn 
for  this  finding.  However,  the  higher  reporting  rate  of  AEs  including  infections  in  the  USA,  has  also 
been  observed  with  IFN,  as  well  as  in  the  pooled placebo  from  OCR  RA  controlled  treatment  studies, 
which the Applicant states is consistent with other reported data in autoimmune indications (Mabthera 
for Rheumatoid Arthritis). For both IFN and OCR groups, the difference in infection by preferred term 
(PT)  between  both  regions  was  driven  by  a  higher  reporting  proportion  of  patients  with 
nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infection, sinusitis, and bronchitis in USA vs ROW. Based on the above, 
the  higher  reporting  rate  of  AEs,  SAEs  and  infections  in  the  USA  with  OCR  in  MS  is  not  considered  a 
safety concern.  
Depression and suicidal ideation are known to occur with increased frequency in the MS population and 
in association with interferon use. In RMS trials, current severe depression and/or suicidal ideation was 
an exclusion criteria. In Pool A similar frequencies and rates of suicide and depression events occurred 
in OCR and IFN groups [OCR: 8.5% vs IFN 7.9%; rate per 100 PY: 5.39 (95% CI: 4.26, 6.72) for the 
OCR group and 5.43 (95% CI: 4.28, 6.80) for the IFN group]. In PPMS, a high proportion of patients 
reported Psychiatric Disorders (mostly depression) in both treatment groups (PBO 13.8%; OCR 9.7%). 
4 events related to suicide (0.8%) occurred in the OCR group (2 suicide attempts, 1 each depression 
suicidal and suicidal ideation), compared to no events in the PBO group. Suicide events were reported 
in 12 ocrelizumab-treated patients (0.5%) in the MS trials (MS OCR all exposure population; N = 2279 
patients)  and  this  rate  is  considered  low  based  on  the  epidemiological  data  (lifetime  prevalence  of 
28.6% with suicide intent and 6.4% with attempted suicide). Overall, the Applicant’s conclusion not to 
include  suicide  attempt/  suicidal  ideation  in  Section  4.8  of  the  SmPC  is  acknowledged,  because  a 
causal  association  between  exposure  to  ocrelizumab  and  suicide  attempt/  suicidal  ideation  cannot  be 
established based on available data. 
Both RMS and PPMS patients with congestive heart failure (NYHA III or IV functional severity) were not 
eligible in the OCR MS clinical development program, because infusion-related reactions (IRRs) in this 
patient  population  could  theoretically  lead  to  serious  CV  consequences,  including  fatal  outcome;  the 
absence of data in patients with a history of congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association III & 
IV)  is  reported  in  section  4.4  in  the  currently  proposed  SmPC.  Furthermore  the  Applicant  states  that 
Assessment report  
EMA/790835/2017 
     Page 155/180 
 
 
 
 
 
the  exclusion  criteria  “history  of  ischemic  cerebrovascular  disorders  (e.g.  stroke,  transient  ischemic 
attack)” was implemented to minimize the risk of drop-out for other health issues.  
In the Phase 3 controlled MS treatment population six CV related SAEs considered drug related by the 
investigator  were  reported  in  5  OCR  treated  patients  (peripheral  arterial  occlusive  disease  and  dry 
gangrene reported in one patient with hyperlipidemia and smoke as other risk factors; cardiac failure 
congestive,  in  a  patient  with  overweight  as  other  risk  factor;  chest  pain,  in  a  patient  with  chest 
tightness  and  pain  with  glatiramer  acetate  injection;  acute  MI  in  a  43  old  female  with  no  known  risk 
factors  and  oedema  peripheral  in  a  54  year  old  female  with  no  known  risk  factors)  compared  to  1 
event in the PBO group (atrial fibrillation, in a patient with obesity and arterial hypertension). 
In the MS all exposure population (Population Pool B), based on the cardiac SMQ retrieval strategy, 19 
CV  related  SAEs  were  reported  in  18  patients.  Most  of  these  patients  had  CV  disease  risk  factors. 
Myocardial  infarction  and  acute  myocardial  infarction  preferred  terms  were  the  most  common  term 
retrieved  (7/18  patients).  The  rates  of  myocardial  infarction  (MI)  reported  in  Pool  B  was  consistent 
with epidemiological data in MS reported by the Applicant. 
On the basis of the above, the Applicant’s conclusion not to include in section 4.8 of the OCR SmPC as 
ADRs  the PT myocardial infarction, cardiac failure congestive, chest pain, dry gangrene and peripheral 
arterial occlusive at this time, nor the addition of information on the absence of data in patients with 
cardiovascular disorders due to OCR trials exclusion criteria  is acknowledged. 
Further  explanation  on  a  serious  adverse  event  of  autoimmune  uveitis  has  been  requested.  The 
Applicant  clarified  that  there  were  no  reports  of  uveitis  or  autoimmune  uveitis  during  the  controlled 
treatment period in any OCR MS and RA clinical studies. In the MS population, after completion of the 
controlled  treatment  periods  and  up  to  the  updated  CCOD  20  January  2016,  4  cases  of  uveitis/ 
autoimmune uveitis were reported. For all patients uveitis was not due to an infection. One patient had 
an  alternative  explanation  (history  of  recidivant  pan-uveitis  since  2004).  It  is  acknowledged  that  an 
association  between  uveitis  and  multiple  sclerosis  –regardless  of  treatment-  has  been  reported  and 
that a causal association between exposure to ocrelizumab and uveitis cannot be definitely established 
based on the above four cases. 
No  reports  of  Immune  Thrombocytopenic  Purpura  (ITP)  occurred  during  the  controlled  treatment 
period  in  any  OCR  MS  clinical  studies.  In  the  MS  population,  after  completion  of  the  controlled 
treatment periods and up to the updated CCOD 20 January 2016, 2 cases of ITP (one life threatening, 
considered  remotely  related  to  OCR  2000  mg  received  in  the  first  cycle  of  study  WA21493,  even 
though occurring  more  than  1.5  years  after the  last  OCR  600  mg  dose;  and one  grade 1,  considered 
not drug related by the investigator) and one event of purpura (not reported as ITP) were reported. No 
cases of ITP were reported with placebo in MS studies with other molecules (Laser Analytical Report). 
Based  on  the  Laser  Analytical  report  the  event  rate  per  100  PY  of  ITP  observed  with  OCR  in  MS  is 
below  the  ranges  reported  for  other  MS  treatments.  At  present  available  data  do  not  allow  a  definite 
conclusion  regarding  a  causal  relationship  with  ocrelizumab.  Idiopathic  thrombocytopenic  purpura  will 
be  monitored  through  routine  pharmacovigilance  in  upcoming  PSURs.  One  case  of  Systemic 
Inflammatory  Response  Syndrome  (SIRS)  which  resulted  in  death  occurred  in  the  Phase  2  study 
WA21493. The aetiology of this SIRS case could not be fully clarified and its underlying cause remains 
unknown. The investigator assessed the event as probably related to ocrelizumab. In addition, one of 
the  two  experts  consulted  by  the  Applicant  considered  the  event  as  possibly  related  to  experimental 
therapy.  Based  on  the  above,  a  causal  relationship  with  OCR  for  this  case  is  at  least  a  reasonable 
possibility. The Applicant has included the case of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) 
in section 4.8 of the SmPC and in section 4.9 (Overdose), with cross reference to section 4.8.  
Marked  increased  GGT  (GGT  >  160  U/L  and  a  change  from  baseline  value  of  at  least  50%)    was 
observed in a higher percentage of patients treated with OCR (6.9%) compared to PBO (4.6%) in the 
PPMS  study  (WA25046).  However  no  imbalance  was  observed  in  increased  ALT  and  AST  between 
treatments  and  no  symptomatic  hepatic  events  were  observed  in  patients  with  increased  GGT.  The 
percentage of AEs related to abnormal liver function tests was similar in the OCR group compared with 
PBO  (25  patients,  5.1%  vs  12  patients,  5%).  10/  25  events  (in  9  patients)  in  the  OCR  group    were 
considered treatment related by the investigator (compared to none in the PBO group) and 6 AEs (in 5 
Assessment report

patients) resulted in modification/interruption of the study treatment in the OCR group (compared with 
none in the PBO group). In RMS patients, a lower percentage of OCR treated patients reported marked 
increased  GGT  (4.3%;  35  patients)  compared  to  the  IFN  group  (9.1%,  75  patients).  On  the  basis  of 
the above, it is agreed that the inclusion of increased GGT or of abnormal liver function tests in Section 
4.8 of the SmPC is not considered warranted at this time. 
Though  in  PPMS  patients  (Study  WA25046)  a  higher  percentage  of  marked  low  hemoglobin 
(hemoglobin  <110  g/L  and  a  change  from  baseline  value  of  at  least  15%)  was  observed  in  the  OCR 
group  compared  with  the  PBO  group  (3.3%;  16  patients  vs  1.7%,  4  patients),  the  percentage  of 
patients  with  replicated  marked  low  values  were  similar  between  the  two  groups  (OCR  2.1  vs  PBO 
1.7%).  Similarly,  no  difference  in  the  percentages  of  AEs  related  to  low  hemoglobin  were  observed 
between  OCR  (3.7%,  18  patients)  and  PBO  groups  (3.8%,  9  patients).  In  RMS,  marked  low 
hemoglobin  was  reported  in  a  lower  percentage  of  patients  in  the  OCR  group  compared  to  the    IFN 
group  (2.7  vs  3.4%),  as  well  as  marked  low  haemoglobin  levels  which  were  replicated  (1.6%  vs 
1.9%). Similarly, the percentage of patients in which anemia-related events were reported was more 
than  2-fold  higher  in  the  IFN  (3.5%;  29  patients)  group  compared  with  OCR  group  (1.5%;  12 
patients).  Thus  the  Applicant’s  conclusion  that  the  inclusion  of  low  haemoglobin  in  section  4.8  of  the 
SmPC is not warranted at this time is acknowledged.  
In  the  PPMS  controlled  treatment  population,  the  percentage  of  patients  in  which  low  lymphocyte 
counts  were  reported  as  a  laboratory  abnormality  was  more  than  2-fold  higher  in  the  OCR  group 
(26.3%) compared with the placebo group (11.7%).  The imbalance in low lymphocyte counts between 
the  OCR  and  placebo  groups  was  driven  primarily  by  Grade  1  (13.1%  vs  5.0%)  or  Grade  2 
lymphopenia  (12.1%  vs  5.4%)  in  ocrelizumab  treated  patients  compared  to  PBO.    No  imbalance  was 
observed between the two treatment groups for Grade 3 lymphopenia (1.0% vs 1.3%) and no cases of 
Grade 4 lymphopenia in either group. Also when considering marked lymphopenia (<0.7 x 10e9/L or a 
change from baseline values of at least 30%, defined by the Applicant as clinically relevant), a higher 
percentage  of  PPMS  ocrelizumab  treated  patients  reported  marked  lymphopenia  compared  with  PBO 
group (6.8% vs 5.0%). In most patients (28/32 PPMS) the value normalized while on study treatment.  
In  the  RMS  controlled  treatment  population  (Pool  A),  the  percentage  of  patients  in  which  low 
lymphocyte  counts  were  reported  as  a  laboratory  abnormality  was  higher  in  the  IFN  group  (32.6%) 
compared  with  the  OCR  group  (20.7%).    This  is  not  unexpected  as  lymphopenia  is  known  to  be 
associated with interferon beta-1a treatment.  The majority of the lymphocyte count abnormalities in 
ocrelizumab treated patients were Grade 1 (10.9% IFN vs 9.4% PBO) and Grade 2 in intensity (18.9% 
vs  10.4%).  Grade  3  abnormalities  were  reported  in  2.8%  of  patients  in  the  IFN  group  and  0.9%  of 
patients in the OCR group. No cases of Grade 4 lymphopenia were reported in either group. Also when 
considering  marked  lymphopenia,  a  higher  percentage  of  IFN  treated  patients  reported  marked 
lymphopenia compared with OCR group (12.8% vs  5.3%). In most patients (34/ 39 RMS Pool A) the 
value normalized while on study treatment. Even though B lymphocyte count depletion is an expected 
therapeutic effect of OCR, the available data indicate that the decreased total lymphocytes count which 
is  observed  only  in  a  subset  of  OCR  treated  patients  is  not  driven  by  B  cell  depletion  (otherwise  we 
would  observe  it  in  the  vast  majority  of  OCR  treated  patients).  Furthermore,  available  data  indicate 
that  lymphopenia  (defined  as  lymphocytes  counts  defined  to  be  <LLN  for  at  least  two  consecutive 
measurements)  is  of  clinical  relevance  as  it  is  associated  with  a  higher  risk  of  serious  infections.  An 
independent statement regarding lymphocytes in section 4.8 of the SmPC has been introduced. 
The Applicant analysed the 8 events of amylase or lipase increased which occurred in 4 patients OCR 
treated patients in the PPMS population, compared to no events in the PBO group. Of these 4 patients, 
1  patient  had  increased  amylase  levels  at  screening,  which  were  sustained  during  the  study;  one  of 
these patients had a concurrent salivary gland adenoma. All events of lipase increase were associated 
in time with one of the amylase increase events. All 4 patients were asymptomatic during the increase 
of these enzymes and did not receive any treatment for the events. All events resolved. The patients 
remained  on  study  treatment  with  ocrelizumab.  No  imbalance  in  adverse  events  of  amylase  or lipase 
increase  was  observed  in the  RMS  and  RA  populations.  7  events  of  pancreatitis  (5  serious  and  2  non 
serious) occurred in 5 patients receiving OCR (2 RMS and 3 PPMS patients),  compared to no events in 
the  control  groups  (IFN  or  PBO).The  onset  latency  was  reported  from  Day  70  to  Day  743.    The  two 
non-serious events in one PPMS patient were reported as drug related by the investigator, while the 5 
Assessment report  
EMA/790835/2017 
     Page 157/180 
 
 
 
 
SAEs  were  reported  as  not  related  to  study treatment.  Risk  factors  that may  have  contributed  to  the 
onset of pancreatitis in three patients included gallstones, cholelithiasis, and high level of triglycerides.  
In the OCR dataset the overall rate of birth defects (6/48, 12.5%) and that the rate of events classified 
by  the  MAH  as  structural  malformations  (3/  48,  6.25%)  was  higher  than  the  one  reported  for  the 
general population (respectively 3.3% and 2–3 %).   
The Applicant argued that there may be differences in counting a birth defect as a major or minor 
congenital malformation according to the classification used. The Applicant argued that the statement 
that the rate of events classified by the applicant as structural malformations (6.25%; 3/ 48 
pregnancies) was higher than that for the general population (3.3%) is not considered appropriate 
since the rate may in fact be equal or lower, depending on the major malformation definitions applied. 
The Applicant’s argumentation is not entirely clear. In fact, as far as the same classification is used to 
assess the frequencies of structural malformations both in the ocrelizumab clinical development 
program and in the general population a comparison should be possible. However, the argumentation 
provided by the Applicant that the conservative rate observed with ocrelizumab is within the range of 
malformations reported in published studies in the MS population treated with other DMTs is 
acknowledeged. Unfortunately appropriate publications could not be found in the literature that 
describes the rate of birth defects in MS, RA or SLE patients, regardless of treatment.  Furthermore, 
the Applicant argues that extensive data available in-house for rituximab, which is another anti-CD 20 
monoclonal antibody, do not suggest that rituximab may cause structural malformations, growth 
alterations, functional deficits, premature births, miscarriages, stillbirths, or any other events not in 
line with the known mode of action and safety profile in non-pregnant adults.  In this regard it must be 
emphasized that even though both Rituximab and OCR target CD20, these are different molecules, 
with different mechanisms of action that may carry different safety profiles.  Overall the Applicant’s 
argumentations for not including at present in section 4.6 of the SmPC the information on the higher 
rate of birth defects and structural malformations compared to the ones reported in the general 
population is acknowledged. The request to extend the use of effective contraception from 6 to 12 
months after the last OCR infusion has been accepted by the Applicant and implemented in the label.  
As regards to patient WA21093-209771-1930433 many information are lacking; the patient started 
open label ocrelizumab on 26 September 2016 and received the last OCR infusion on 28 August 2015. 
Concomitant drugs were sertraline and bromazepam. On an unspecified date in 2015 she became 
pregnant. On 28 January 2016 she was admitted to the hospital and her pregnancy ended with a 
stillborn baby on the same day. The results of the autopsy performed on the child were not reported 
and the reason for the death was unknown. During subsequent steps in the procedure, the requested 
data regarding the autopsy and additional circumstances concerning the pregnancy and stillbirth was 
provided by the Applicant. Available data do not allow the drawing of definite conclusions regarding the 
stillbirth, the autopsy report of the foetus concluded that the morphological changes in the lungs and 
heart speak in favor of severe asphyxia, after attempts of inhaling air. The death outcome occurred 
due to short-term inhalation of fluid. The premature childbirth is a consequence of the occurred 
retroplacental haematoma and multiple infarctions within the placenta, which was also confirmed by 
the pathohistological finding. No infection was reported before and after the delivery of stillbirth.  
A PASS with the title “Multi-source surveillance study of pregnancy and infant outcomes in 
ocrelizumab-exposed women with multiple sclerosis” (BA39732) will be conducted to assess and 
characterize pregnancy outcome.  
There  are  limited  data  regarding  safety  post  last  dose.  The  Applicant  stated  that  the  most  unbiased 
body  of  data  in  which  to  consider  safety  post  last  dose  is  the  planned  treatment  free  period  in  the 
Phase  II  study  WA21493,  where  90%  of  patients  exposed  to  any  ocrelizumab  dose  (196  out  of  the 
total of 218 randomized patients) entered the TFP. No increased risk of SAEs or serious infections post-
last dose was observed in the TFP of the Phase II study WA21493. Among patients exposed to OCR in 
the Phase 3 trials, only 178 (8.6%) patients entered the SFU. Also in these updated safety data (CCOD 
Assessment report  
EMA/790835/2017 
     Page 158/180 
 
 
 
 
20 January 2016) the rates of SAEs (26.1; 95% CI: 19.69-34,02) and of serious infections (10.5; 95% 
CI:  6.55,  15,83)  per  100  PY  post  last  dose  are  higher  than  the  rates  reported  in  the  3  month  safety 
update for the overall all exposure population of Pool C (that includes all safety data from the pivotal 
RMS  studies  (SAEs:  5.78;  95%  CI:  4.98-  6.68;  serious  infections:  1.92,  95%  CI:  1.47-2,46).  The 
majority  of  SAEs  and  Serious  infections  were  reported  within  the  first  24  weeks  post-last  dose.  The 
Applicant  has  committed  to  continue  to  collect  and  analyse  data  regarding  high  risk  of  SAEs  and 
serious  infections  post  last  dose  of  ocrelizumab  as  the  data  currently  available  to  assess  ocrelizumab 
safety  after  the  last  dose  is  limited.  Section  5.1  already  provides  information  on  the  long  lasting 
pharmacodynamics effect of ocrelizumab and as such, the prescriber is presented with the knowledge 
currently available. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
In order to evaluate the long term safety of the product, two PAS studies were recommended to be 
performed, one of which will include a wider PPMS population. 
The main safety issues with ocrelizumab are the risk of infusion related reactions and infections. With 
regards to IRRs the majority were manageable. Further, the risk of serious infections was lower than 
with  IFN  and  comparable  to  placebo  but  more  patients  in  the  ocrelizumab  groups  with  serious 
infections had a worse outcome than in the comparator groups. Furthermore, both in RMS (Pool A) and 
in PPMS, in the subgroup of subjects with lymphocytes confirmed to be <LLN, higher rates of serious 
infections  were  observed  in  OCR  treated  patients  compared  to  IFN/  PBO  treated  patients.  Increased 
rates of serious infection were observed in RMS patients and in Pool B over time (beginning at Dose 5). 
In  addition,  there  is  a  small  imbalance  with  regards  to  malignancies,  which  seem  to  be  driven  by  a 
cluster breast cancer. However, available data do not allow to definitely establish nor rule out a clear 
causality  to  ocrelizumab  treatment.  The  Applicant  has  proposed  a  post-marketing  Long-Term 
Surveillance of Ocrelizumab-Treated Patients with Multiple Sclerosis study. In the PAS study, baseline 
and  on-treatment  tumour  surveillance  should  be  planned.  Furthermore,  in  section  4.4,  subparagraph 
malignancies  of  the proposed  SmPC  adequate information  and  recommendations  for  prescribers  have 
been  provided.  The  Applicant  has  proposed  a  restriction  of  the  indication  to  active  RMS  due  to  the 
uncertainties related to the imbalance in malignancies, which is supported.  
Compared  to  IFN,  ocrelizumab  causes  neutropenia  or  increased  levels  of  hepatic  transaminases  with 
lower  frequencies.  However,  Grade  4  neutropenia  occurred  in  OCR  treated  patients  compared  to  no 
Grade  4  events  in  IFN  group.  Furthermore  2  PPMS  patients  received  GCSF  treatment  for  neutropenic 
SAEs. 
Relevant safety issues have adequately been identified an added to the RMP.

Objectives 
To assess and characterize the 
long-term safety data from the 
use of ocrelizumab in patients 
with MS. 
The primary objective is to 
estimate the event rates of 
SAEs, including malignancy and 
infections, following 
ocrelizumab treatment in 
patients with MS 
The secondary objective is: to 
compare the incidence of each 
serious safety event between 
ocrelizumab-exposed patients 
with MS and patients with MS 
exposed to other approved 
DMTs (overall and by individual 
DMTs if possible), within the 
same data source. If sufficient 
data are available, an 
exploratory objective of this 
study is to compare the safety 
profile of patients with MS 
exposed to ocrelizumab to the 
safety profile of patients with 
MS not exposed to any DMTs. 
To evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of ocrelizumab 
(Ocrevus®) compared with 
placebo in patients EDSS 3 to 8 
using 9HPT as the primary 
efficacy outcome, and 12 week

as a key secondary endpoint. 
Baseline assessment of features 
characteristic of imaging 
inflammatory activity  (T1 Gd-

2.11.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.11.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it is a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained 
in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Ocrelizumab  has  been  developed  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  relapsing  forms  of  multiple 
sclerosis (RMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS). 
During the assessment process, the Applicant amended the indication initially applied for as follows:  
“Ocrevus  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  relapsing  forms  of  multiple  sclerosis 
(RMS) with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features (see section 5.1).  
Ocrevus  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  early  primary  progressive  multiple 
sclerosis  (PPMS)  in  terms  of  disease  duration  and  level  of  disability,  and  with  imaging  features 
characteristic of inflammatory activity (see section 5.1). 
In  approximately 85%  of patients,  MS  begins  as  a  relapsing,  episodic disorder  with  gradual  complete 
or  incomplete  recovery,  relapsing  remitting  multiple  sclerosis  (RRMS).  Remitting  multiple  sclerosis 
(RMS)  is  used  to  describe  those  patients  with  either  RRMS  or  secondary  progressive  MS  (SPMS)  who 
continue to experience relapses.  Patients accumulate disability as a result of incomplete recovery from 
acute  relapses  and/or  gradual  disease  progression.  The  aim  of  the  treatment  is  to  suppress  relapses 
and disease progression. 
Primary  progressive  MS  (PPMS)  accounts  for  approximately  10% of  all  cases.  It  is  characterized  by  a 
progressive  course  from  disease  onset,  with  infrequent  superimposed  discrete  clinical  attacks  or 
relapses. The aim of the treatment is to delay disease progression.

3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
RMS 
In addition to treatments for the symptoms of MS and treatment of relapses (such as corticosteroids), 
there  are  currently  12  disease  modifying  therapies  (DMTs)  approved  for  use  in  patients  with  RRMS 
and/or  other  forms  of  RMS  in  the  EU.  In  a  clinical  setting,  first  line  treatment  is  usually  dimethyl 
fumarate,  teriflunomide,  glatiramer  acetate  or  a  medical  product  within  the  interferon  beta  class. 
Second or third line therapies are usually natalizumab, alemtuzumab or fingolimod.   
PPMS –unmet medical need 
No treatment has been demonstrated to significantly slow the progression of disability in patients with 
PPMS,  including  therapies  approved  for  the  treatment  of  RMS.  Phase  III  RCTs  evaluating  glatiramer 
acetate,  mitoxantrone,  interferon  beta-1a  IM,  interferon  beta-1b,  fingolimod and  a  Phase  II/III  study 
with rituximab did not demonstrate significant impact on clinical progression in the PPMS population. In 
the  absence  of  any  approved  treatment  for  PPMS,  a  variety  of  unapproved  agents  including 
mycophenolate  mofetil,  cyclophosphamide,  mitoxantrone,  or  rituximab,  in  addition  to  other  therapies 
approved for the treatment of RMS, are used in clinical practice.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
RMS: 
In  study  WA21092,  the  primary  endpoint,  annualized  relapse  rate  (ARR)  was  met  with  a  reduction 
46.4%  compared  with  interferon  beta-1a.  Adjusted  ARR  Ratio  (95%  CI),  ITT  population:  0.537, 
(0.400, 0719), p< 0001.  Statistically significant outcomes for the secondary endpoints CDP 12 Weeks 
and CDP 24 Weeks were observed, however not for CDI 12 weeks. 
The  other  main  study  WA21093  also  met  its  primary  endpoint  as  treatment  with  ocrelizumab 
significantly reduced the ARR by 46.8% at 96 Weeks compared with interferon beta-1a. Adjusted ARR 
Ratio  (95%  CI),  ITT  population:  0.532  (0.397  – 0.714),  p  <0.0001.  Statistically  significant outcomes 
for the secondary endpoints CDP 12 Weeks and CDP 24 Weeks were registered, however not for CDI at 
12 weeks.  
Results from individual studies were consistent with those from the pre-specified pooled analysis.  The 
primary  endpoint  was  met  with  a  statistically  significant  reduction  of  the  ARR  of  47%  compared  with 
interferon  beta-1a.  The  continued  hierarchical  statistical  testing  for  the  secondary  endpoints  CDP  12 
weeks,  most  MRI  endpoints,  CDI  12  Weeks  and  CDP  24  Weeks  revealed  statistically  significant 
findings.  The  secondary  endpoint  MSFC  was  not  met,  and  therefore  the  hierarchical  statistical  testing 
for  the  remaining  secondary  endpoints  MRI  Brain  volume  (p  =  0.0042)  and  NEDA  (p  <  0.0001)  was 
non-confirmatory, whilst the statistical significance testing for SF-36 PCS was negative.

Subgroups  analyses  across  the  main  studies  did  not  identify  a  subgroup  clearly  yielding  more  or  less 
treatment benefit. For ARR, patients who were active or highly active inadequate responders or highly 
active treatment naïve appeared to have a borderline better treatment effect than those who were not. 
However,  in  every  subgroup  ocrelizumab  showed  superior  efficacy  compared  to  IFN.  For  CDP  12 
Weeks,  treatment  naïve  subjects  with  active  and  highly  active  disease  activity  tended  numerically  to 
have  less  treatment  benefit.  For  ARR,  the  effect  of  OCR  seems  not  to  be  overall  influenced  by  the 
disease  duration,  although  in  study  WA21093  a  trend  favouring  OCR  effect  in  patients  with  longer 
disease duration was observed. 
PPMS 
The  main  study,  study  WA25046,  met  its  primary  endpoint  (time  to  event).  Treatment  with 
ocrelizumab  led  to  a  24%  reduction  in  the  risk  of  12-week  CDP  compared  with  placebo  (hazard  ratio 
0.76 [95% CI: 0.59, 0.98], p=0.0321). The Kaplan-Meier survival curves for time to onset of 12-week 
CDP  showed  separation  from  12  weeks,  with  a  lower  proportion  of  patients  in  the  ocrelizumab  group 
with CDP throughout the treatment period.  
The  continued  hierarchical  statistical  testing  for  the  secondary  endpoints  time  to  CDP  24  weeks  (p 
=0.0365), change in timed walk from baseline to week 120 (p = 0.0404), two MRI endpoints related to 
change  in  total  T2  lesion  volume  and  Brain  volume  (p  <  0.0001  and  p  =  0.0206,  respectively)  were 
met. The last secondary endpoint SF-36 PCS for the hierarchical testing was not met.  
Pre-specified  non-powered  subgroup  analyses  of  the  primary  endpoint  indicate  that  patients  who  are 
younger  or  those  with  T1  Gd-enhancing  lesions  at  baseline  receive  a  greater  treatment  benefit  than 
patients  who  are  older  or  without  T1  Gd-enhancing  lesions  [≤  45  years:  HR  0.64  (0.45,  .0.92),  >45 
years: HR 0.88 (0.62, 1.26); with T1 Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline: HR 0.65 (0.40-1.06), without 
T1  Gd-enhancing  lesions  at  baseline:  HR  0.84  (0.62-1.13)].  Moreover,  post-hoc  analyses  suggested 
that younger patients with T1 Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline have the better treatment effect [≤ 45 
years:  HR  0.52  (0.27-1.00);  ≤  46  years  (median  age  of  the  WA25046  study);  HR  0.48  (0.25-0.92); 
<51 years: HR 0.53 (0.31-0.89)].   
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
RMS and PPMS 
The clinical studies submitted did not enrol subjects with an age above 55 years. Efficacy results from 
adults ≤ 55 years of age cannot readily be extrapolated to adults > 55 years of age and the elderly as 
the disease changes with time and the effect size might be smaller. However, patients enrolled in the 
ongoing clinical trials continue to be dosed with 600 mg ocrelizumab every six months after they 
become 55 and older.  
Persistence of efficacy beyond the results observed in the controlled period will only be available from 
the open label extension with limitation in the design of such.  
RMS 
Both main studies used MMRM as the method to handle missing data in the analysis of change in MSFC, 
SF-36  PCS  and  change  in  Brain  volume.  MMRM  is  not  regarded  as  being  sufficiently  conservative 
method for this purpose.  
NEDA  showed  in  both  main  studies  a  non-confirmatory  p-value  of  <0.0001,  but  for  subjects  who 
withdrew  prematurely,  only  subjects  who  were  withdrawn  due  to  lack  of  efficacy  or  death  were 
regarded to have disease activity.  
The analyses on SPMS have some limitations, which prevent drawing definite conclusions on the effect 
of OCR on SPMS independent of acute inflammatory events.  In particular, they do not exclude that the 
effect  of  OCR  on  disability  may  be  driven  by  its  effect  on  inflammation  and  on  inflammation-related 
Assessment report  
EMA/790835/2017 
     Page 168/180 
 
 
 
 
 
  
disability accumulation more than on the pure neurodegeneration-related disability. Based on the EMA 
guidelines on MS, as the anti-inflammatory effect of OCR has been demonstrated by the results on ARR 
in both studies WA21092 and WA21093, for reasons related to biological plausibility, this drug could be 
considered effective in preventing relapses not only in patients with RRMS but also in those with SPMS. 
PPMS 
Only  one  study  in  PPMS  patients  has  been  conducted.  It  met  the  primary  endpoint  12-week  CDP, 
however  not  with  a  compelling  p-value  (HR  0.76  [95%  CI:  0.59,  0.98],  p  =  0.0321).  Statistical 
evidence stronger than p<0.05 on the primary endpoint would usually be required when a single trial is 
conducted. 
The Applicant compiled clinical and imaging endpoints from the RMS Studies WA21092 and WA21093 
and compared them with the outcomes for the corresponding endpoints in the PPMS Study. However, 
these  data  originate  from  a  MS  disease  entity  other  than  PPMS  and,  also  as  noted  by  the  experts 
consulted during the scientific advisory group in neurology, it is uncertain to which extent they might 
contribute to the evidence for the PPMS indication.  
Inclusion criteria of study WA25046 have led to the recruitment of a patient population that may not 
reflect the broad PPMS patient population neither with regard to age (age range limited to 18-55 
years,) nor with regard to disability (the selected EDSS inclusion range excludes more advanced 
disease stages). Analyses performed by the Applicant suggest that not only age but also T1-Gd 
enhancing lesions may modulate the effect of OCR on disability progression. However, based on 
analyses by strata and data description used by the Applicant it was difficult to draw conclusions on 
whether age was the variable that drove the increase of the effect size independent of the presence of 
T1 Gd-enhancing lesions (or vice versa) and, in addition, on whether there was an interaction effect or 
independence between these two variables (at least as a trend). The only way to understand the effect 
of each single component independently of the other ones, would be by building a multivariate Cox 
regression model with the description of the effect by each single component independently of the 
other ones and by interaction components.As for MRI disease characteristics, T1 Gd-enhancing lesions 
were present in 25-27% of patients. It was difficult to establish whether this percentage is higher than 
what observed in the clinical practice setting because data on the presence of T1 Gd-enhancing lesions 
in PPMS are few, originate mostly from RCTs, and vary across trials(i.e., in the PROMiSE study on GA 
the percentage of patients with T1 Gd-enhancing lesions was 14%; in the INFORMS study on 
fingolimod, 13%; in the study with rituximab, 24.5%). Furthermore, in WA25046 study the information 
of “new or enlarging T2 lesions” (the other MRI criteria considered characteristic of inflammatory 
activity, besides T1 Gd-enhancing lesions) at baseline is missing. 
The Kaplan-Meier survival curves for time to onset of 12-week CDP showed separation from 12 weeks 
but the separation did not seem to increase thereafter. A similar pattern for the Kaplan-Meier survival 
curves was seen for CDP 24 Weeks. The absolute difference for proportion of patients with a 12 –Week 
CDP at Week 120 was just around 4% implying an NNT of 25 subjects, whilst the sample size estimate 
assumed an absolute difference of 13%. A similar absolute difference was seen for CDP 24 Weeks.  
With  regard  to  imputation  of  initial  disability  progression  events  for  patients  with  early  treatment 
discontinuation, the approach of ignoring these events resulted in a reduced treatment effect (HR 0.82 
[95% CI: 0.63, 1.07], p=0.1477). However, multiple imputation (HR 0.78 [95% CI: 0.60, 1.02]) and 
imputation by efficacy related reason for withdrawal / withdrawal by subject (HR 0.77 [95% CI: 0.60, 
1.00], p=0.0490) resulted in consistent estimates of the treatment effect. 
Although a statistical significant difference (p = 0.0404) was observed between OCR and placebo over 
120  weeks    in  terms  of  the  25-foot  walk  (T25-FW)  ,  the  difference  between  unadjusted  means  of 
absolute  changes  from  baseline  was  of  only  3  seconds.  Furthermore,  when  expressed  as  unadjusted 
median  values  of  absolute  changes  from  baseline,  a  more  reliable  estimate  of  treatment  effect  when 
Assessment report  
EMA/790835/2017 
     Page 169/180 
 
 
 
 
distribution  of  results  is  strongly  skewed,  the  difference  between  OCR  and  placebo  was  even  lower 
than 3 seconds (0.43 seconds).  
Furthermore,  the  pre-specified  rules  for  censoring/imputation  of  patients  who  withdrew  from 
treatment, although reasonable, are not completely reassuring of not introducing some overestimation 
of the treatment effect, particularly in consideration of the high amount of withdrawals from treatment 
(about  25%)  and  the  imbalance  between  the  two  treatment  groups  (placebo  group,  33.6%  vs.  OCR, 
20.7%). 
During  the  assessment, data  issues  have  been  identified  at  several  sites  during  a  GCP  inspection.  An 
analysis  was  presented  excluding  897  (24%)  EDSS  assessment  as  these  were  potentially  done  after 
infusion.  This  sensitivity  analysis  of  Time  to  Onset  of  CDP  for  at  Least  12  Weeks  during  the  Double-
Blind  Treatment  Period  demonstrated  a  Hazard  Ratio  (95%  CI)  of  0.81  (0.63,  1.04).  An  analysis 
excluding  22  sites  with  a  total  of  197  subjects  (a  total  of  732  patients  were  enrolled  in  the  study), 
showed  a  slightly lower  hazard  ratio  (00.69  compared  to the  original  0.76))  and  a  very  minor loss in 
precision  of  the  estimated  95%  confidence  interval  of  the  hazard  ratio,  which  was  unexpected  given 
the  loss  in  data.  However,  further  analyses  of  the  primary  endpoint  in  the  22  excluded  sites  showed 
that there was no difference between the two treatment groups. Analyses of the secondary endpoints 
lead to the conclusion that the most likely reason for not observing an effect for the primary endpoint 
in  the  22  excluded  trial  sites  was  caused  by  poor  conduct  of  the  study  with  regards  to  adequately 
capturing the clinical endpoints. Thus, GCP findings  and the exclusion of 22 trial sites did not change 
the results from the original analyses.   
A  total  of  157  major  protocol  deviations  occurred  in  68  patients  of  the  study  (75  deviations  of  the 
inclusion or exclusion criteria and 82 deviations during study conduct). In a PP analysis repeated after 
exclusion of all patients with major protocol deviation the risk reduction with OCR compared to placebo 
decreased and statistical significance was not achieved even at the standard levels of 0.05.  
Several  other  sensitivity  analyses  were  performed,  the  results  of  which  only  partially  confirmed  the 
results of the primary analysis. 
Results  from  subgroup  analyses  added  further  uncertainty  to  the  overall  understanding  of  treatment 
benefit.  In  particular,  the  apparent  reduction  of  treatment  effect  in  females  with  PPMS,  not  seen  in 
RMS  patients,  was  not  understood  and  explained  by  the  distribution  of  Gd-enhancing  lesions  at 
baseline.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Infusion related reactions occurred (IRRS) more frequently in the ocrelizumab groups (34.3%-39.9%) 
compared  to  IFN  (9.7%)  and  placebo  (25.5%).  Most  were  Grade  1  or  2  in  intensity  and  one  patient 
had  a  Grade  4  IRR  in  the  RMS  studies.  There  were  5  serious  IRRs  in  the  PPMS  study.  Most  IRRs 
occurred  with  the  first  infusion  and  the  incidence  subsequently  decreased.  Splitting  the  600  mg  dose 
into  two  with  a  two  weeks  separation  in  the  PPMS  trial  did  not  reduce  the  overall  risk  of  IRRs.  IRRs 
lead to a discontinuation rate of 0.4% in the PPMS trial and 1.3% in the RMS studies.  
Infections  occurred  more  frequently  (rates  per  100PY)  with  ocrelizumab  (85.4;  95%  CI:  80.7,  90.3) 
than  with  IFN  (69.1;  95%  CI:  64.8,  73.5).  The  largest  difference  was  seen  in  viral  infections,  26.5% 
vs.  20.5%,  although  bacterial  infections  also  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  ocrelizumab  group, 
21.6%  vs.  18.6%.  Infections  including  non-serious  infection  requiring  IV  anti-infective  treatment 
occurred more frequently in the IFN group, 3.8% vs. 1.8% in the ocrelizumab group, and was primarily 
of  bacterial  origin.  However,  while  the  rate  of  serious  infections  in  the  overall  RMS  population  was 
higher in patients treated with IFN (1.79 events per 100 PY) compared with patients treated with OCR 
(0.83  per  100  PY),  in  the  subgroup  of  subjects  with  lymphocytes  confirmed  to  be  <LLN  (defined  as 
counts   <  LLN  for  at  least  2  consecutive  measurements),  higher  rates  of  serious  infections  were 
observed in OCR treated patients (4.22) compared to IFN treated patients (0). 
Assessment report  
EMA/790835/2017 
     Page 170/180 
 
 
 
 
In the PPMS study, the frequency of infections per 100PY in the placebo group and ocrelizumab group 
was similar; placebo 76.1; 95% CI: 69.6, 83.0 and ocrelizumab 76.5; 95% CI: 72.0, 81.2. Similarly to 
what  observed  in  the  RMS  population,  while  the  rate  of  serious  infections  in  the  overall  PPMS 
population  was  similar  in patients  treated  with  OCR  (2.97 events  per  100  PY)  and  in  patients  treated 
with  PBO  (2.88  per  100  PY),  in  the  subgroup  of  subjects  with  lymphocytes  confirmed  to  be  <LLN, 
higher  rates  of  serious  infections  were  observed  in  OCR  treated  patients  (7.93)  compared  to  PBO 
treated patients (0). 
Even  though  the  number  of  events  is  low,  and  thus  the  confidence  intervals  partially  overlap,  these 
data have a strong biological plausibility: in patients that are B cell depleted, if also the overall number 
of lymphocytes decrease, these patients are at increased risk of infections. 
Furthermore,  serious  infection  had  a  worse  outcome  in  OCR-treated  patients  compared  to  control 
groups;  more  patients  in  the  ocrelizumab  group  experienced  Grade  4  (1.6%  vs.  0.4%),  and  Grade  5 
(death)  (0.4%  vs.  0%)  infections.  The  higher  frequency  of  life  threatening  serious  infections  and  of 
serious infection leading to death in OCR treated patients compared to comparators was confirmed in 
the  3-month  safety  update  (CCOD  20  January  2016)  (OCR:  12/  1311,  0.9%  vs  PBO/IFN:  1/1065, 
0.09%). 
The  rate  of  infections  leading  to  withdrawal  was  slightly  lower  in  the  ocrelizumab  group  than  in  the 
placebo group.  
Increased rates of serious infection were observed in RMS patients and in Pool B over time (beginning 
at Dose 5). 
Herpes  and  candida  infections,  in  the  RMS  studies  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  ocrelizumab 
group. The overall rate of events per 100PYwas 2.79 (95% CI: 1.98, 3.81) in the IFN group and 5.25 
(95% CI: 4.14, 6.57) in the ocrelizumab group. However, in the PPMS trial the overall rate of events 
per 100PY was 3.03 (95% CI: 1.85, 4.68) in the placebo group and 2.33 (95% CI: 1.60, 3.27) in the 
ocrelizumab  group.    One  case  of  PML  has  been  reported  with  the  use  of  ocrelizumab,  however,  the 
patient had previously been treated with natalizumab.  
Compared  to  IFN,  ocrelizumab  causes  neutropenia  with  lower  frequencies.  However,  Grade  4 
neutropenia  occurred  in  OCR  treated  patients  compared  to  no  Grade  4  events  in  IFN  group. 
Furthermore 2 PPMS patients received GCSF treatment for neutropenic SAEs. 
In  the  majority  of  patients,  IgM  levels  decreased  significantly.  In  Pool  B  (MS  All  exposure)  rates  of 
serious infections per 100PY in patients with levels of IgA, IgG and IgM below the LLN at any timepoint 
were  higher  than  the  rate  in  the  overall  population.  Risk  associated  with  development  of  infections 
were high BMI and previous infections. CD19+ B cell count was near complete depletion at Week 2 and 
the median time to repletion (return to baseline or LLN, whichever was lower) of B cells was 72 weeks 
(range 27 to 175 weeks) after the last infusion. 
Higher  rate  of  serious  infections  were  observed  in  patients  with  confirmed  low  lymphocyte  counts 
compared to patients without lymphocyte counts <LLN, as well as in patients with confirmed decreases 
in  CD4  and  CD8  T  cells below  the LLN,  compared  to  patients  without  CD4  and  CD8  T  cells  below  the 
LLN.  Even though the  number of events are low, and thus the confidence intervals partially overlap, 
these data have a strong biological plausibility: in patients that are B cell depleted, if also T cells are 
decreased,  these  patients  are  at  increased  risk  of  infections.  Even  though  B  lymphocyte  count 
depletion is an expected therapeutic effect of OCR, the available data indicate that the decreased total 
lymphocytes  count  which  is  observed  only in  a  subset of  OCR  treated patients  is  not  driven by  B  cell 
depletion (otherwise we would observe it in the vast majority of OCR treated patients). 
There  was  a  slight  increase  in  the  incidence  of  malignancies  in  the  ocrelizumab  groups  compared  to 
IFN and placebo - rate of malignancy per 100PY, ocrelizumab RMS 0.28 (95% CI: 0.08, 0.71) vs. IFN 
0.14  (95%  CI:  0.02,  0.52)  and  ocrelizumab  PPMS  0.92  (95%  CI:  0.49,  1.57) vs.  placebo  0.30  (95% 
CI: 0.04, 1.10).

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
More than 1173 MS patients were exposed to the proposed dose 600 mg dose for more than 95 weeks 
with a total of 4485 patient years of exposure to ocrelizumab in the MS population.  However, even if 
this is a large safety database rare adverse events or adverse events likely to occur later might not 
have been captured. In particular, available long term exposure data do not allow to conclusively 
evaluate both the risk of malignancies as well as PML. Moreover, the exclusion of patients >55 years 
old, prevents the assessment of the safety profile of OCR in the elderly, in particular with respect to 
malignancies, the risk of which is known to increase with age.  
Patients with a history of recurrent or chronic infections or immunodeficiency, and patients with a 
history of ischemic cerebrovascular disorders were excluded from the pivotal trials. Cardiovascular 
disease was not among exclusion criteria, but there was only one enrolled patient with a history of 
cardiovascular disease (SMQ cardiac failure). The safety of OCR in the presence of the above 
mentioned morbidities is thus not assessable at present. 
Opportunistic infections, but not PML were seen in the RA population where ocrelizumab exposure 
corresponds to 7324 patients years albeit in dose levels ranging from 20 mg to 2000 mg. Opportunistic 
and serious infections was also seen in the SLE and LN population and 6% and 3%, respectively died in 
these population due to infections. It is uncertain if safety data from these patient populations can be 
extrapolated to the MS population as patients in the RA, SLE and LN population also received additional 
immunosuppressant treatment, had different comorbidities and the RA population was older than the 
MS population. It is thus unknown if prior or current immunosuppressant treatment in the MS 
population will increase the risk of infections. It is also unknown, had the safety database been as 
large as in RA, if cases of opportunistic infections would have occurred in the MS population. 
Up to the 30 Jun 2016, there were in total 26 cases of malignancies reported in MS patients treated 
with ocrelizumab. There was an imbalance in the incidence of malignancies in the ocrelizumab groups 
compared to IFN and placebo with a cluster of breast cancers in the ocrelizumab groups. There were 
no cases of breast cancer in the IFN or placebo groups whereas there were 3 cases in the RMS 
ocrelizumab group and 4 cases in the PPMS ocrelizumab group. One further case of breast cancer 
occurred in a RRMS patient from study WA21493 (treated with OCR 2000 mg) and one further case of 
breast cancer occurred in a patient switched to OCR in the open label phase of study WA21093. It is 
uncertain why this imbalance was observed and currently the data from the RA development 
programme is not considered adequate to evaluate a long term risk, because in the RA ocrelizumab 
development program the median number of ocrelizumab doses received by the patients was only 2 in 
the controlled treatment period and only 3 in the uncontrolled pool. In randomised controlled trials 
only about 20% of randomized RA patients received more than 2 OCR doses and only 38 patients 
received up to 8 OCR doses in the open label part. The higher incidence of malignancies, with a cluster 
for breast cancer, observed in OCR-treated patients relative to comparator (IFN or placebo) is a cause 
of concern, particularly as age >55 years was an exclusion criteria. 
Additionally, long-term safety has not been investigated, and for this reason the applicant will perform 
post-approval studies to address this issue.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
RMS 
The  population  included  in  the  RMS  trial  represents  RMS  patients  with  an  active  disease  stage. 
Clinically  relevant  and  consistent  superior  efficacy  of  ocrelizumab  versus  interferon  beta-1a  in  the 
reduction  of  ARR  and  also  clinically  relevant  effect  on  secondary  endpoints  in  two  pivotal  phase  III 
studies has been shown. 
A  clinically  relevant  effect  has  been  shown  across  subgroups  regardless  of  previous  treatment  or 
respond  to  other  treatments.  This  is  important  as  interferon  beta-1a  (IFN)  is  considered  one  of  4-5 
medicines for first line treatment in RMS.  
PPMS 
There  is  a  particularly  high  unmet  medical  need  in  patients  with  PPMS,  as  there  are  no  disease 
modifying treatments approved. 
The magnitude of the observed effect on the 12-week CDPis modest, but nevertheless.relevant in the 
context of a relentlessly progressive disease. There is no accepted definition of what would constitute a 
minimal clinical benefit and, as stressed by the patients, any delay in disease progression is important 
to them in this setting.

The  identification  of  the  PPMS  patient  population  that  may  benefit  from  treatment  with  the  drug  was 
difficult. 
The  pathogenic  mechanism  in  PPMS  is  one  of  extraordinary  complexity.  The  co-existing  processes  of 
inflammation  and  neurodegeneration  elicit  themselves  differently  during  the  different  stages  of  the 
disease,  and  mechanisms  other  than  those  involving  B  cells  could  be  involved  in  the  persistent 
inflammation,  which  ocrelizumab  may  act  upon.  Thus,  the  administration  of  a  single  monoclonal 
antibody and its very specific mechanism of action is unlikely to be able to fully counteract the whole 
pathological  cascade  in  PPMS.  One  hypothesised  manner  in  which  the  effects  of  ocrelizumab  in  this 
case  could  be  mediated  is  the  fact  that  by  acting  on  the  inflammatory  component  of  the  disease  the 
drug  could  allow  for  an  improved  process  of  remyalination  and  repair  to  occur,  thus  indirectly 
influencing  the  neurodegeneration.  This  hypothesis  has  still  to  be  confirmed,  as  at  present  there  are 
not enough data to substantiate it.    
The  identification  of  the  PPMS  patient  population  that  may  benefit  from  treatment  with  the  drug  was 
difficult, as it had to rely on subgroup analyses, for which the study was not powered. After a number 
of  discussions  with  the  applicant  and  among  experts,  it  was  agreed  that  based  on  the  available  data 
presented  in  the  analyses,  it  was  reasonable  to  believe  that  patients  for  whom  disease  duration  and 
level of disability, as well as available imaging features characteristic of inflammatory activity (i.e. T1 
Gd-enhancing lesions and/or active [new or enlarging T2 lesions]) suggested that they are in the early 
phase of PPMS, were most likely to experience the most benefit from ocrelizumab treatment 
Additionally,  some  supportive  reasoning  about  the  identification  of  a  sub-population  of  PPMS  patients 
that can benefit more from ocrelizumab, can be derived from the exploratory subgroup analysis of the 
findings from a similar trial performed with another monoclonal antibody (Olympus). 
Therefore,  the  CHMP  limited  the  indication  to  “early”  PPMS  where  sufficient  evidence  of  efficacy  is 
available.  
RMS and PPMS 
The main safety issues with ocrelizumab is the risk of infusion related reactions and infections. Infusion 
related reactions, although frequent, were for the majority of patients manageable, which is also 
reflected in the low frequency of discontinuations due to IRRs. Infections occurred more frequently in 
the ocrelizumab groups. Even if serious infection or infection requiring IV antiinfectives occurred less 
frequently in the ocrelizumab group than in the IFN group, serious infections had a worse outcome 
(including 2 deaths) in OCR-treated patients, both in RMS (Pool A) and in PPMS patients, suggesting 
that ocrelizumab does cause an increased risk of infections. A worse outcome of serious infections is a 
concern with a B cell depleting therapy, as in the real world setting a higher frequency of serious 
infection is expected, potentially leading to higher mortality rates. On the other end, it is also true that 
the frequency of grade 4 (life-threatening) and grade 5 (fatal) infections was low in all treatment 
groups, and that in the placebo arm was about 0%, which is possibly an underestimation of the risk 
associated with the natural course of the disease. In any case, it is of some degree of reassurance that 
all life-threatening infections resolved without discontinuing ocrelizumab. 
Further,  it  is  still  unknown  if  opportunistic  infections  and  a  higher  frequency  of  infections  is  likely  to 
occur  if  additional  immunosuppressants  are  administered.  Unlike  IFN,  ocrelizumab  does  not  have  an 
adverse  effect  in  the  liver.      Furthermore,  both  in  RMS  (Pool  A)  and  in  PPMS,  in  the  subgroup  of 
subjects  with  lymphocytes  confirmed  to  be  <LLN,  higher  rates  of  serious  infections  were  observed  in 
OCR treated patients compared to IFN/ PBO treated patients. Increased rates of serious infection were 
observed in RMS patients and in Pool B over time (beginning at Dose 5). 
The safety profile of ocrelizumab shows an increased frequency of malignancies compared to control 
groups, which seem to be driven by a cluster of breast cancer. However, the incidence was not higher 
as compared to epidemiological data and available data do not allow to definitely establish - nor rule 
out - a clear causality to ocrelizumab treatment. Uncertainties exist as regards the occurrence of rare 
opportunistic infections, like PML. However, due to the uncertainties regarding the imbalance of 
Assessment report  
EMA/790835/2017 
     Page 176/180 
 
 
 
 
malignancies, the currently proposed indication is a restriction of the indication to be used in patients 
with active RMS.  
Balance of benefits and risks 
RMS 
Clinically  relevant  and  superior  efficacy  versus  IFN  has  been  demonstrated  regardless  of  previous 
treatment or response to prior treatment in a population with active disease. Due to the uncertainties 
regarding the imbalance in malignancies it is considered appropriate to restrict the indication to active 
RMS. The benefit/risk of ocrelizumab for the use in patients with active RMS was considered positive.  
PPMS 
The results of the pivotal study, supported by the additional evidence derived from the performed sub-
group  analyses,  provided  sufficient  grounds  to  establish  that  a  PPMS  sub-population  exists,  in  which 
the  benefits  outweigh  the  risks  of  treatment  with  ocrelizumab.  The  magnitude  of  the  effect  of 
ocrelizumab  is  considered  modest,  but  sufficient  as  no  other  approved  treatments  are  currently 
available.  The  safety  profile  in  this  population,  including  the  uncertainties  regarding  the  imbalance  in 
malignancies,  was  considered  in  the  context  of  the  present  unmet  clinical  need  in  a  relentless, 
seriously debilitating disease. The apparent worse outcome of serious infections with ocrelizumab was 
based on very low numbers; and it is of some reassurance that all life-threatening infections resolved 
without discontinuing ocrelizumab.  
The  indication  is  limited  to  early  PPMS  patients  as  these  are  expected  to  benefit  the  most  from 
ocrelizumab and for whom the potential risks will be more acceptable.  
The benefit of ocrelizumab in the sought early PPMS indication is thus considered to outweigh the risks.    
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Ocrevus is positive in the pursued indication including RMS and early PPMS.  
Divergent position(s) are appended to this report. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority 
decision that the risk-benefit balance of Ocrevus is favourable in the following indication: 
Ocrevus is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) 
with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features (see section 5.1).  
Ocrevus is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with early primary progressive multiple 
sclerosis (PPMS) in terms of disease duration and level of disability, and with imaging features 
characteristic of inflammatory activity (see section 5.1). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 9 NOVEMBER 2017 
Ocrevus EMEA/H/C/004043 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending 
the granting of the marketing authorisation for Ocrevus indicated for the treatment of adult patients 
with: 
• 
• 
relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) with active disease defined by clinical or imaging 
features 
early primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) in terms of disease duration and level of 
disability, and with imaging features characteristic of inflammatory activity. 
 The reasons for divergent opinion were the following: 
Efficacy in the PPMS population has not been sufficiently established. A single confirmatory trial has 
been conducted in this population. In the event of a submission with only one pivotal study, this has to 
be particularly compelling with respect to internal and external validity, clinical relevance, statistical 
significance, data quality, and internal consistency. 
The primary endpoint and most secondary endpoints were met; however, the demonstrated efficacy is 
not compelling from a statistical and clinical point of view. 
The pre-specified subgroup analyses as well as post hoc analyses suggest that a subgroup of patients 
with early PPMS and signs of acute inflammation may be the patient population most likely to benefit. 
However, these exploratory subgroup analyses are hypotheses generating and do not identify a patient 
population where efficacy has been sufficiently established.  
In view of the above considerations the undersigned delegates consider the benefit risk of this product 
to be negative:

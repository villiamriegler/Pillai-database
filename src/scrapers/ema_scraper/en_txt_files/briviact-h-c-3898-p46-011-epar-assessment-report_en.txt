1.  Introduction 
On July 25, 2022, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Briviact, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that EP0159 is a pooled analysis of non-interventional, retrospective studies. This 
pooled analysis was not a pediatric analysis; however, the study included clinical chart review data for 
pediatric patients. Data from 1976 patients (5 countries and 9 cohorts) were made available. One 
cohort, SP4, was pediatric. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
EP0159 is a pooled analysis of non-interventional, retrospective, international studies that utilized 
clinical chart review cohorts of patients who initiated BRV in clinical practice. Eligible patients were 
treated with BRV according to standard clinical practice in their region. Pharmaceutical formulation was 
not specified as per study. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
EPD332 and/or EP0159, in this report referred to as EP0159 
Brivaracetam is a 2 pyrrolidone derivative and displays a high and selective interaction with synaptic 
vesicle protein 2A in the brain. This binding site appears to be the major target for its pharmacological 
activity. 
In 2016, marketing authorization for the use of oral and intravenous BRV was granted as adjunctive 
treatment of partial-onset seizures (POS) with or without secondary generalization in adult and 
adolescent patients with epilepsy ≥16 years of age in the EU and US.  An application for the extension 
of indication to the pediatric population from 4 years of age in the EU (adjunctive) and the US 
(adjunctive and monotherapy) based on the concept of extrapolation of efficacy data from the adult 
population was approved in 2018. On 24 Feb 2022, the extension of the indication for adjunctive 
treatment of POS in children aged from 2 years to 4 years (for all formulations) was approved in the 
EU. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study EP0159 
EP0159 is a pooled analysis of non-interventional, retrospective, international studies that utilized 
clinical chart review cohorts of patients who initiated BRV in clinical practice. Eligible patients were 
treated with BRV according to standard clinical practice in their region. Eligible patients had at least 6 
months and ideally 12 months of follow-up data after BRV initiation, until BRV discontinuation, loss to 
follow up, or death. 
As this is a pooled analysis of BRV effectiveness and tolerability in clinical practice, there are no 
prespecified treatment groups. 
The Patient Selection Period varied by country, as BRV approval, treatment guidelines, and 
reimbursement varied by country. The date of BRV product availability in each country marked the 
beginning of the Patient Selection Period. All patients had the ability to complete 12 months of follow 
up after BRV initiation (or at least 6 months of follow up in countries where BRV launch occurred after 
June 2018). The study period ended for each patient at the earliest date of the following events: BRV 
discontinuation, death, disenrollment, 365 days of follow up, and/or end of the study period. As such, 
patients were to have initiated BRV no earlier than Jan 2016 and no later than Dec 2019.  
Of note, covariates in this study were routinely assessed upon initiation of clinical care for epilepsy. 
Although it was unlikely to have had prospectively collected records from birth for these variables, 
there was retrospective variable assessment at clinic entry, which was part of the medical record. 
When medical history data were not assessed, they were recorded as missing. 
•  Covariates assessed at Baseline included: age, sex, number of seizures per month, seizure 
types, concomitant ASMs, and comorbidities. 
•  Historical covariates included: age at epilepsy onset, duration of epilepsy, etiology, and 
previous ASMs. 
•  Censoring - Earliest of: Outcome of interest (BRV discontinuation), death, disenrollment, 365 
days of follow up, or end of the study period. 
CHMP´s comment  
According to EP0159 Study report body, no measures were taken to impute or replace missing data. If 
there were patients with missing data, a missing row was added, and percentages were based on the 
number of patients in the analysis set (n).  
Primary analysis was performed using data from the 3, 6 and 12 months timepoints by applying 
pragmatic intention to treat (p-ITT) rules as follows: If for a given timepoint, outcomes were missing 
due to end of follow up because BRV was discontinued during that timepoint, outcomes were assigned 
as follows for that timepoint and for the subsequent ones: seizure frequency: not applicable; seizure 
freedom at timepoint: no; seizure freedom from Baseline: no; and seizure reduction: non-responder.  
This results in a conservative way to handle missing data for the below described endpoints ≥50% 
seizure reduction from Baseline at 12 months and seizure freedom at 12 months. Twenty-seven of the 
66 patients (40.9%) in the pediatric SP4 cohort had discontinued before 12 months.  
Cohorts of EP0159 
Data from 1976 patients (5 countries and 9 cohorts) were made available to the EP0159 pooled 
analysis. The combined cohort used for the primary analysis (N=1644) of adult patients (defined in the 
protocol as ≥16 years of age) included cohorts SP1 (N=544), SP3 (N=196), GER (N=275), GER1 
(N=213), AUS (N=291), and University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). 
Pediatric patients 
The EPD332/EP1059 pooled analysis was not a pediatric analysis; however, the study included clinical 
chart review data for pediatric patients. In the EP0159 real world evidence report (RWE) study report, 
all outcomes were investigated among the whole population; however, in order to reduce 
heterogeneity of the population, cohorts were split into adults (defined in the protocol as ≥16 years of 
age) and children (defined in the protocol as <16 years of age). The only pediatric cohort analyzed in 
the EP0159 RWE Study Report was the SP4 cohort, which included 66 pediatric patients (defined as 
<16 years of age per protocol).  
All other cohorts (SP1, SP2, GER, GER1, AUS, UAB, and UK) were adult cohorts; however, data from 
an additional 9 pediatric patients (<16 years of age) from these cohorts were captured and excluded 
from the adult cohorts (refer to EP1059 RWE Study Report Table 10 1). In addition, patients who were 
16 and 17 years of age were considered adults per protocol (≥16 years of age) and were analyzed 
among the adult population; therefore, data from 11 patients (16 to 17 years of age) from these 
cohorts were captured. Due to the small pediatric sample size within each of these cohorts and 
because these 9 pediatric patients (<16 years of age) and 11 patients (16 to 17 years of age) did not 
constitute a homogenous subgroup of pediatric patients, data from these patients were not analyzed 
within the EP0159 RWE study report. Therefore, for these patients, no statistics were calculated, and 
they are only described as narratives in this assessment report. 
CHMP’s comment: 
Cohort SP4 included 66 patients aged < 16 years. Five of the other cohorts had together included 9 
patients aged <16 years of age, and two cohorts had included together 11 patients aged 16-17 years 
of age.  
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the 12-month effectiveness and tolerability of BRV 
either on polytherapy or monotherapy in a large population of selected patients in routine clinical 
practice. 
The secondary objective of this study was to describe 12-month BRV effectiveness and tolerability of 
BRV in specific patient subgroups. 
Outcome measures 
Primary outcome measures 
•  ≥50% seizure reduction from Baseline at 12 months (measured among only patients who have 
at least one seizure at baseline, the Modified Full Analysis Set (mFAS). 
•  BRV discontinuation due to BRV-related adverse events (AEs). Note: BRV discontinuations due 
to AEs were not collected in any cohort included in the pooled analysis; therefore, the posthoc 
tolerability outcome of BRV discontinuation due to tolerability was added. 
Secondary outcome measures 
The following effectiveness outcome measures were assessed among all remaining patients on BRV at 
each timepoint: 
•  3-, 6-month responder: ≥50% seizure reduction from Baseline (measured among only patients 
who had at least 1 seizure at Baseline [mFAS]). 
•  3-, 6-, and 12-month seizure freedom. Note: Seizure freedom was defined as no seizures within 3 
months prior to the timepoint, which differs from the SAP definition of seizure freedom (no seizures 
from BRV initiation); therefore, the posthoc effectiveness outcome below was added. 
−  Posthoc effectiveness outcome: 3-, 6-, and 12-month continuous seizure freedom.* 
*The posthoc effectiveness outcome: 3-, 6-, and 12-month seizure freedom (defined as no 
seizures within 28 days prior to timepoint) was not measured and was replaced by the above 
posthoc effectiveness outcome of continuous seizure freedom. 
•  3-, 6-, and 12-month retention rate: BRV discontinuation is the event. Patients having had no 
event (ie, did not discontinue BRV) are censored at end of follow up. 
•  Days of BRV exposure. 
 
Figure 1: Definitions of seizure freedom and continuous seizure freedom after Baseline at 3, 6, and 12 
months 
The following tolerability and safety variables were analyzed: 
• 
Incidence of AEs (AEs at 3, 6, and 12 months and at last visit were defined as since previous visit 
[not from BRV initiation]).* 
•  3-, 6-, and 12-month severity (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA] classification 
of AEs). 
•  3-, 6-, and 12-month discontinuations due to AEs. Note: BRV discontinuations due to AEs were not 
collected in any cohort included in the pooled analysis; therefore, the posthoc tolerability outcome 
below was added. 
−  Posthoc tolerability outcome: BRV discontinuation due to tolerability. 
• 
• 
• 
Incidence of psychiatric AEs (PAEs) and nonPAEs**. 
Incidence of cognitive AEs (CAEs) and nonCAEs**. 
Incidence of behavioral AEs (BAEs) and nonBAEs**. 
The following additional variables were analyzed: 
•  BRV dosing at 3, 6, and 12 months after BRV initiation and at last visit. 
•  Concomitant maintenance and rescue ASM (ie, AED) use (including dose of levetiracetam) at 3, 6, 
and 12 months after BRV initiation and at last visit. 
•  Concomitant prescriptions for other conditions (than epilepsy) at 3, 6, and 12 months after BRV 
initiation. 
*At each visit, the number of AEs from the previous visit were reported and coded as Preferred Term 
(PT) using MedDRA version 24.0. 
**AEs were classified by the UCB safety team into these categories: PAEs, CAEs and BAEs. 
 
 
 
 
CHMP’s comment: 
It is questioned if it is purposeful to calculate 50% responders (and seizure freedom) in patients with 
the definition of at least 1 seizure at baseline. Some other minimum number of seizures at baseline 
may have been preferrable to obtain at least some accuracy in the calculations. According to table 15 
(EP0159 tables), 2 patients were seizure free at index and 3 patients had 1-3 seizures per 28 days. 
Thus, the majority (61 patients) had ≥ 4 seizures per 28 days.  
Efficacy – effectiveness 
As efficacy was not assessed in the EP0159 RWE study report, only outcomes pertaining to 
effectiveness are presented. 
Participants 
The following pediatric data were captured in the EP0159 study: 
• 
• 
• 
Data from 66 patients in the SP4 cohort (<16 years of age).

narratives categorized by a number from 1 to 9 further down in this report. 
Data from 11 patients (16 to 17 years of age): data from these 11 patients will be described as 
narratives categorized by a letter from “A” to “K” in further down in this report. 
Demographics 
In the SP4 pediatric cohort, 12 patients (18.18%) were 0 to 5 years of age, 30 patients (45.45%) were 
6 to 11 years of age, and 24 patients (36.36%) were 12 to 15 years of age. Forty-three patients 
(65.15%) were male, and 23 patients (34.85%) were female. 
Of the 9 patients who were <16 years of age and who were excluded in the adult cohorts, 1 patient 
was 0 to 5 years of age, and 8 patients were 12 to 15 years of age. Five patients were male, and 4 
patients were female. 
Of the 11 patients who were 16 to 17 years of age, 5 patients were male, and 6 patients were female. 
Baseline characteristics 
In the SP4 pediatric cohort, the mean±standard deviation (SD) duration of epilepsy in 66 patients with 
observed data was 6.5±3.7 years (median [minimum (min), maximum (max)]: 6.0 years [1.0, 13.0]). 
For epilepsy etiology, most patients in the SP4 pediatric cohort had an unknown or other etiology (22 
patients (33.33%); followed by 18 patients (27.27%) with a genetic etiology, 14 patients (21.21%) 
with a malformation of cortical development, 11 patients (16.67%) with a structural etiology (vascular, 
tumor-related, traumatic), and 1 patient (1.52%) with a metabolic disorder etiology. At Baseline, 27 
patients (40.91%) had focal epilepsy, 22 patients (33.33%) had generalized epilepsy, and 17 patients 
(25.76%) had focal and generalized epilepsy, and a majority of patients (42 patients [63.64%]) had a 
seizure type of focal onset. Among patients with seizure subtype available, a majority of patients had 
unknown subtypes (56 patients [84.85%]). Of the 42 patients with focal onset seizures, 30 patients 
(71.43%) had focal seizures evolving to bilateral. Of the 25 patients with generalized seizures, 16 
patients (64.00%) had myoclonic seizures and 18 patients (72.00%) had absence seizures. Two 
patients (3.03%) had seizure freedom at Baseline, and 64 patients (96.97%) did not have seizure 
freedom at Baseline. A majority of pediatric patients had a 28-day seizure frequency at index of ≥28 
seizures, and the mean±SD 28 day seizure frequency at index for 66 patients with observed data was 
186.7±394.1 seizures (median [min, max]:45.0 seizures [0.0, 2500.0]). Sixty-three patients 
(96.92%) used polytherapy at index and 2 patients (3.08%) used monotherapy at index. Of the 66

CHMP´s comment: 
The indication of Briviact is focal onset seizures with or without bilateral spreading. Yet it is noted that 
one third of patients in cohort SP4 did not have focal seizures as recorded in the study, 1 of the 9 
pediatric patients captured within the other cohorts did not have focal epilepsy and 4 of 11 among the 
16–17-year-olds.  
Effectiveness evaluation 
Seizure reduction (≥50% from Baseline to 12 months) 
Seizure reduction was assessed among patients who had at least 1 seizure at Baseline (mFAS). 
In the SP4 pediatric cohort, 20 patients (31.25%) had seizure reduction ≥50% from Baseline to 12 
months, and 44 patients (68.75%) did not have seizure reduction ≥50% from Baseline to 12 months. 
The mFAS for the SP4 pediatric cohort consisted of 64 patients who had ≥1 seizure recorded during 
Baseline. 
Of the 9 patients who were <16 years of age and who were excluded from the adult cohorts, Patients 
6, 7, and 8 had seizure reduction ≥50% from Baseline to 12 months; Patient 4 did not have seizure 
reduction ≥50% from Baseline to 12 months; and the remaining 5 patients were missing seizure 
reduction ≥50% from Baseline to 12 months: 
All 11 patients who were 16 to 17 years of age did not have data collected for seizure reduction ≥50% 
from Baseline to 12 months. 
CHMP´s comment: 
Studies in adults (doses 50-200mg) have shown 50% responder rates between 22.0 and 38.9%. In 
this pediatric cohort the 50% responder rate at 12 months was 31.3% which is within the interval 
found in studies in adults.  
Seizure freedom (12 months) 
In the SP4 pediatric cohort, seizure freedom after Baseline occurred in 10 patients (15.15%) at 12 
months. 
Of the 9 patients who were <16 years of age and who were excluded from the adult cohorts, Patient 7 
had seizure freedom after Baseline at 12 months; Patients 4, 6, and 8 did not have seizure freedom 
after Baseline at 12 months; and Patients 1, 2, 3, 5, and 9 were missing seizure freedom after Baseline 
at 12 months. 
Of the patients who were 16 to 17 years of age, Patients F and I had seizure freedom after Baseline to 
12 months; Patients D, E, G, H, and K did not have seizure freedom after Baseline to 12 months; 
Patient J was missing seizure freedom after Baseline to 12 months; and Patients A, B, and C did not 
have data collected for seizure freedom after Baseline to 12 months. 
CHMP´s comment: 
Seizure freedom at 12 months was defined as seizure free the last three months. In the pivotal studies 
in adults, seizure freedom was recorded when there was continuous seizure freedom for the whole 12 
weeks study period. Thus, the duration of the seizure free interval is the same, but the time from 
treatment onset differs. In cohort SP4, 15,2% of patients were seizure free at 12 months which is a 
larger proportion of patients reaching seizure freedom compared to the adult pivotal studies: 2,5 % 
(4/161), 5,1 % (17/332) and 4,0 % (10/249) of patients who received brivaracetam 50 mg/day, 100 
mg/day and 200 mg/day respectively. Of placebo treated patients 0,5 % (2/418) were classified as 
seizure free. 
Effectiveness conclusion by the Applicant 
The results of the EP0159 study are in line with the recently published studies of BRV. The 
effectiveness results indicate a positive benefit-risk balance of BRV. 
Safety 
In the SP4 pediatric cohort, 43 patients (65.15%) discontinued BRV, and 23 patients did not 
discontinue BRV. The 43 patients who discontinued BRV were missing discontinuation reason; 
therefore, the patients who discontinued BRV due to tolerability were not collected at any timepoint for 
the SP4 pediatric cohort. 
A Kaplan-Meier curve for treatment retention where BRV discontinuation is the event is presented for 
the SP4 cohort (Figure 2). Patients having had no event (ie, did not discontinue BRV) were censored at 
end of follow up. After 380 days, less than 50% of the population will remain on BRV. 
 
Figure 2: Kaplan-Meier curve for treatment retention for the SP4 pediatric cohort 
Of the 9 patients who were <16 years of age and who were excluded from the adult cohorts, Patient 3 
discontinued BRV for the reason of tolerability, Patient 4 discontinued BRV for the reason of other, 
Patient 8 discontinued BRV for the reason of effectiveness and tolerability, and the remaining 6 
patients did not discontinue BRV. 
Of the 11 patients who were 16 to 17 years of age, Patient H discontinued BRV for the reason of 
tolerability, Patient K discontinued BRV for the reason of effectiveness and tolerability, and the 
remaining 9 patients did not discontinue BRV. 
CHMP´s comment 
Of the 66 pediatric patients, 43 (65.2) discontinued. Twenty-seven (40.9%) had discontinued before 
12 months. Median days of exposure was 375 and mean time of exposure was 484 days. There is no 
information regarding the causes for discontinuation and it is not possible to analyse e g proportions of 
patients who discontinues due to lack of efficacy or tolerability issues/AEs. 
 
 
 
Adverse events 
The percentages were calculated among all pediatric patients with a documented observation of having 
a TEAE or not having a TEAE. As such, patients with missing data and patients with data not collected 
were excluded from the calculation. 
In the SP4 pediatric cohort, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were documented for 12 
patients (18.18%) since previous visit at 3 months, 10 patients (15.15%) since previous visit at 6 
months, 3 patients (4.84%) since previous visit at 12 months, and 12 patients (18.18%) since 
previous visit at last visit. 
In the SP4 pediatric cohort, the incidence of TEAEs by PT documented since previous visit included the 
following: 
•  At 3 months: irritability and hypersomnia (5 patients [7.58%], each), insomnia (3 patients 
[4.55%]), and dizziness (1 patient [1.52%]).  
•  At 6 months and 12 months: AEs were documented for 10 patients (15.15%) and 3 patients 
(4.84%), respectively; however, these AEs were not further described in the database. 
•  At last visit: irritability and hypersomnia (5 patients [7.58%], each), insomnia (3 patients 
[4.55%]), and dizziness (1 patient [1.52%]).  
In the SP4 pediatric cohort, most TEAEs were moderate at 3 months (8 patients [80.00%]) and 6 
months (6 patients [66.67%]). At 12 months and last visit, 1 patient was documented at each 
timepoint as having mild TEAEs. At 3 months and 12 months, no severe TEAEs were documented, and 
at 6 months a severe TEAE was documented for 1 patient (11.11%). No life-threatening TEAEs were 
documented at any timepoint. 
Discontinuations due to AEs were not collected in the participating cohorts; alternatively, 
discontinuations due to tolerability were assessed. 
In the SP4 pediatric cohort, no PAEs, CAEs, or BAEs were documented at 3 months or at last visit. At 6 
months and 12 months, the AEs that occurred were not further described in the database. 
CHMP´s comment: 
The reported AEs in SP4 are known ADRs of brivaracetam and already listed in the SmPC of Briviact 
section 4.8. The frequencies of the AEs reported in SP4 are in line with those tabulated in 4.8.  
One patient reported a severe AE at the 6 months visit. There is no additional information regarding 
the type of AE, the outcome of possible causality.  
It is stated that discontinuations due to AEs were not collected in the participating cohorts; 
alternatively, discontinuations due to tolerability were assessed. However, no such data are available 
either and the reasons for discontinuation is unknown.  
For the 9 patients who were <16 years of age and who were excluded from adult cohorts, the 
incidence of TEAEs, TEAEs by PT (as applicable), and TEAE severity (as applicable) documented for 
each patient since previous visit at 3, 6, and 12 months and at last visit were as follows: 
1.  Patient 1 had no TEAEs at 3, 6, or 12 months or at last visit. 
2.  Patient 2 had TEAEs at 3 months (aggression; mild in severity), 6 months (AE occurred by not 
further described in the database), and last visit (AE occurred by not further described in the 
database). No TEAEs were reported at 12 months. 
3.  Patient 3 had TEAEs at 3 months (decreased appetite and fatigue; severe in severity) and last 
visit (AE occurred by not further described in the database). No TEAEs were reported at 6 or 12 
months. 
4.  Patient 4 had no TEAEs at 3, 6, or 12 months or at last visit. 
5.  Patient 5 was missing incidence of TEAEs at 3, 6, and 12 months and at last visit because they 
had no visit at any timepoint. 
6.  Patient 6 had TEAEs at 6 months (bradyphrenia and memory impairment; mild in severity) and 
at last visit (no TEAE description; mild in severity). No TEAEs were reported at 3 months or 12 
months. 
7.  Patient 7 had TEAEs at 3 months (irritability and somnolence; mild in severity), 6 months 
(irritability; mild in severity), and at last visit (no TEAE description; mild in severity). No TEAEs 
were reported at 12 months. 
8.  Patient 8 had TEAEs at 6 months (bradyphrenia and memory impairment; moderate in 
severity), 12 months (bradyphrenia and memory impairment; moderate in severity), and at 
last visit (no TEAE description; moderate in severity). No TEAEs were reported at 3 months. 
9.  Patient 9 had no TEAEs at 3 or 6 months or at last visit and was missing incidence of TEAEs at 
12 months because they had no visit at the timepoint.  
For the 11 patients who were 16 to 17 years of age, the incidence of TEAEs, TEAEs by PT (as 
applicable), and TEAE severity (as applicable) documented for each patient since previous visit at 3, 6, 
and 12 months and at last visit were as follows: 
A.  Patient A did not have TEAE data collected at 3, 6, or 12 months and had no TEAEs at last visit. 
B.  Patient B did not have TEAE data collected at 3, 6, or 12 months and had no TEAEs at last visit. 
C.  Patient C did not have TEAE data collected at 3, 6, or 12 months and had no TEAEs at last visit. 
D.  Patient D had no TEAEs at 3, 6, or 12 months or at last visit. 
E.  Patient E had TEAEs at 12 months (somnolence; moderate in severity) and at last visit 
(no TEAE description; moderate in severity). No TEAEs were reported at 3 or 6 months. 
F.  Patient F had TEAEs at 3 months (coordination abnormal and dizziness; moderate in severity). 
No TEAEs were reported at 6 or 12 months or at last visit. 
G.  Patient G had TEAEs at 3 months (irritability and anxiety; moderate in severity), 6 months 
(irritability and anxiety; moderate in severity), and at last visit (AE occurred but not further 
described in the database). No TEAEs were reported at 12 months. 
H.  Patient H had TEAEs at 3 months (NA [being evil, contains, prostration, skin problems or other; 
terms were reported as a sole AE and did not present with a PT to code the AE adequately]; 
severe in severity), 6 months (NA [being evil, contains, prostration, skin problems or other]; 
severity not described), and at last visit (no TEAE description; severe in severity). They were 
missing incidence of TEAEs at 12 months because they had no visit at the timepoint. 
I.  Patient I had no TEAEs at 3, 6, or 12 months or at last visit. 
J.  Patient J had no TEAEs at 3, 6, or 12 months or at last visit. 
K.  Patient K had TEAEs at 3 months (coordination abnormal and dizziness; severe in severity), 
and at last visit (AE occurred but not further described in the database). They were missing 
incidence of TEAEs at 6 and 12 months because they had no visit at the timepoints. 
CHMP´s comment: 
Among the 20 patients < 18 years old who were included in other cohorts than SP4, 2 patients 
reported bradyphrenia and memory impairment (mild and moderate intensity respectively). These are 
not established ADRs of brivaracetam, but memory impairment was one of the most frequently 
reported PTs in adults during the last PSUR period (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010447/202101). Memory 
impairment was also reported after medication error and overdose.   
Bradyphrenia and memory impairment reflect mild cognitive impairment, a common problem among 
anti-epileptic medications as a group (Sung-Pa et al, J Clin Neurol, 2008). However, brivaracetam has 
been associated with a smaller such risk than many other ASMs (Sarkis et al, J Neurol, 2018). A 
proportion of patients with epilepsy also suffer from (mild) cognitive impairment. As no narratives are 
presented, it is not possible to assess causality in the current two cases. However, the MAH should 
commit to provide a cumulative review regarding cognitive impairment in brivaracetam treatment in 
the next PSUR.  
Two other patients reported abnormal coordination, moderate and severe intensity respectively. 
Impaired coordination is not listed as an ADR of brivaracetam but is reported to occur by a frequency 
of uncommon for levetiracetam. As narratives as lacking, causality cannot be assessed in the current 
two cases. As impaired coordination may be a class effect, the MAH should provide a cumulative review 
regarding impaired coordination in brivaracetam treatment in the next PSUR.  
Safety conclusions by the applicant 
The results of the EP0159 study are in line with the recently published studies of BRV and no evidence 
of new safety concerns was found. 
Benefits and risks conclusions by the Applicant 
The results of the EP0159 study are in line with the recently published studies of BRV. The 
effectiveness results indicate a positive benefit-risk balance of BRV. It provides additional evidence that 
BRV as prescribed in the real world is effective and well-tolerated among children and adolescents.  
The results of EP0159 are being submitted in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 
1901/2006 (The Paediatric Regulation). No changes to the approved EU Product Information for 
Briviact are being proposed with this submission based on EP0159 results. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The SP4 cohort of study EP0159 consisted of 66 paediatric patients. Additional data were gathered 
from paediatric patients (<16 years old) and 16-17-year-olds included in other cohorts (N=9 and N=11 
respectively).  
The primary outcome measure was responder rate at 12 months (at least 50% seizure reduction 
month 9-12 compared to baseline). The responder rate was 31.3% in the SP4 cohort. Studies in adults 
(doses 50-200mg) have shown 50% responder rates between 22.0 and 38.9%, and thus the PS4 
responder rate is within the interval found in the pivotal studies in adults. 
15.2% of paediatric patients in SP4 were seizure free at 12 months which can be compared to seizure 
freedom achieved in the adult pivotal studies: 2.5 % (4/161), 5.1 % (17/332) and 4.0 % (10/249) of 
patients who received brivaracetam 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day and 200 mg/day respectively.  
The pivotal studies in adults and EP0159 differ in many ways which may explain some of the difference 
in efficacy/effectiveness, but the postmarketing data obtained in EP0159 do not give rise to any 
concern regarding effectiveness.  
Most of the reported TEAS are ADRs already known and listed for brivaracetam. Some reports of TEAE 
did not include any PT, including one of severe intensity.  
Among the 20 patients < 18 years old who were included in other cohorts than SP4, 2 patients 
reported bradyphrenia and memory impairment (mild and moderate intensity respectively). These are 
not established ADRs of brivaracetam, but memory impairment was one of the most frequently 
reported PTs in adults during the last PSUR period (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010447/202101). Memory 
impairment was also reported after medication error and overdose.   
Bradyphrenia and memory impairment reflect mild cognitive impairment, a common problem among 
anti-seizure medications as a group (Sung-Pa et al, J Clin Neurol, 2008). However, brivaracetam has 
been associated with a smaller such risk than many other ASMs (Sarkis et al, J Neurol, 2018). A 
proportion of patients with epilepsy also suffer from (mild) cognitive impairment. As no narratives are 
presented, it is not possible to assess causality in the current two cases. However, the MAH should 
provide a cumulative review (company safety database, Eudravigilance, and literature) regarding 
cognitive impairment in brivaracetam treatment in the next PSUR.  
Two other patients reported abnormal coordination of moderate and severe intensity, respectively. 
Impaired coordination is not listed as an ADR of brivaracetam but is reported to occur by a frequency 
of uncommon for levetiracetam. As narratives as lacking, causality cannot be assessed in the current 
two cases. Impaired coordination might be a class effect and the MAH should provide a cumulative 
review (company safety database, Eudravigilance, and literature) regarding impaired coordination in 
brivaracetam treatment in the next PSUR.  
Discontinuations due to AEs were not collected in the participating cohorts and it is stated that 
alternatively, discontinuations due to tolerability were assessed. However, no such data are available 
and the reasons for discontinuations are unknown. 
No safety concern that warrants regulatory action has been identified. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
 Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required, however the MAH should submit cumulative reviews regarding cognitive 
dysfunction (including memory impairment), and impaired coordination within the next PSUR.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Alecensa as monotherapy is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with anaplastic 
lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
Alecensa as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with ALK-positive advanced 
NSCLC previously treated with crizotinib. 
4.2 
Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with Alecensa should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of 
anticancer medicinal products. 
A validated ALK assay is necessary for the selection of ALK-positive NSCLC patients. ALK-positive 
NSCLC status should be established prior to initiation of Alecensa therapy.  
Posology 
The recommended dose of Alecensa is 600 mg (four 150 mg capsules) taken twice daily with food 
(total daily dose of 1200 mg).  
Patients with underlying severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) should receive a starting dose of 
450 mg taken twice daily with food (total daily dose of 900 mg). 
Duration of treatment 
Treatment with Alecensa should be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
Delayed or missed doses 
If a planned dose of Alecensa is missed, patients can make up that dose unless the next dose is due 
within 6 hours. Patients should not take two doses at the same time to make up for a missed dose. If 
vomiting occurs after taking a dose of Alecensa, patients should take the next dose at the scheduled 
time.

Dose adjustments 
Management of adverse events may require dose reduction, temporary interruption, or discontinuation 
of treatment with Alecensa. The dose of Alecensa should be reduced in steps of 150 mg twice daily 
based on tolerability. Alecensa treatment should be permanently discontinued if patients are unable to 
tolerate the 300 mg twice daily dose.  
Dose modification advice is provided in Tables 1 and 2 below.

Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
No starting dose adjustment is required in patients with underlying mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate 
(Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment. Patients with underlying severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
C) should receive a starting dose of 450 mg taken twice daily (total dose of 900 mg) (see section 5.2). 
For all patients with hepatic impairment, appropriate monitoring (e.g. markers of liver function) is 
advised, see section 4.4. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Alecensa has not 
been studied in patients with severe renal impairment. However, since alectinib elimination via the 
kidney is negligible, no dose adjustment is required in patients with severe renal impairment (see 
section 5.2).  
Elderly (≥ 65 years) 
The limited data on the safety and efficacy of Alecensa in patients aged 65 years and older do not 
suggest that a dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (see section 5.2). There are no available 
data on patients over 80 years of age. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Alecensa in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not been 
established. No data are available.

Extreme body weight (>130 kg) 
Although pharmacokinetic (PK) simulations for Alecensa do not indicate a low exposure in patients 
with extreme body weight (i.e. >130 kg), alectinib is widely distributed and clinical studies for 
alectinib enrolled patients within a range of body weights of 36.9−123 kg. There are no available data 
on patients with body weight above 130 kg. 
Method of administration  
Alecensa is for oral use. The hard capsules should be swallowed whole, and must not be opened or 
dissolved. They must be taken with food (see section 5.2). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to alectinib or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis 
Cases of ILD/pneumonitis have been reported in clinical trials with Alecensa (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be monitored for pulmonary symptoms indicative of pneumonitis. Alecensa should be 
immediately interrupted in patients diagnosed with ILD/pneumonitis and should be permanently 
discontinued if no other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis have been identified (see section 4.2).  
Hepatotoxicity 
Elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) greater than 
5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) as well as bilirubin elevations of more than 3 times the ULN 
occurred in patients in pivotal clinical trials with Alecensa (see section 4.8). The majority of these 
events occurred during the first 3 months of treatment. In the pivotal Alecensa clinical trials it was 
reported that three patients with Grade 3-4 AST/ALT elevations had drug induced liver injury. 
Concurrent elevations in ALT or AST greater than or equal 3 times the ULN and total bilirubin greater 
than or equal 2 times the ULN, with normal alkaline phosphatase, occurred in one patient treated in 
Alecensa clinical trials. 
Liver function, including ALT, AST, and total bilirubin should be monitored at baseline and then 
every 2 weeks during the first 3 months of treatment. Thereafter, monitoring should be performed 
periodically, since events may occur later than 3 months, with more frequent testing in patients who 
develop aminotransferase and bilirubin elevations. Based on the severity of the adverse drug reaction, 
Alecensa should be withheld and resumed at a reduced dose, or permanently discontinued as described 
in Table 2 (see section 4.2).  
Severe myalgia and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation 
Myalgia or musculoskeletal pain was reported in patients in pivotal trials with Alecensa, including 
Grade 3 events (see section 4.8).  
Elevations of CPK occurred in pivotal trials with Alecensa, including Grade 3 events (see section 4.8). 
Median time to Grade 3 CPK elevation was 14 days across clinical trials (NP28761, NP28673, 
BO28984).   
Patients should be advised to report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. CPK 
levels should be assessed every two weeks for the first month of treatment and as clinically indicated 
in patients reporting symptoms. Based on the severity of the CPK elevation, Alecensa should be 
withheld, then resumed or dose reduced (see section 4.2). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bradycardia 
Symptomatic bradycardia can occur with Alecensa (see section 4.8). Heart rate and blood pressure 
should be monitored as clinically indicated. Dose modification is not required in case of asymptomatic 
bradycardia (see section 4.2). If patients experience symptomatic bradycardia or life-threatening 
events, concomitant medicinal products known to cause bradycardia, as well as anti-hypertensive 
medicinal products should be evaluated and Alecensa treatment should be adjusted as described in 
Table 2 (see sections 4.2 and 4.5, ‘P-gp substrates’ and ‘BCRP substrates’). 
Haemolytic anaemia 
Haemolytic anaemia has been reported with Alecensa (see section 4.8). If haemoglobin concentration 
is below 10 g/dL and haemolytic anaemia is suspected, Alecensa should be withheld and appropriate 
laboratory testing should be initiated. If haemolytic anaemia is confirmed, Alecensa should be 
resumed at a reduced dose upon resolution as described in Table 2  (see section 4.2). 
Gastrointestinal perforation 
Cases of gastrointestinal perforations have been reported in patients at increased risk (e.g., history of 
diverticulitis, metastases to the gastrointestinal tract, concomitant use of medicinal product with a 
recognized risk of gastrointestinal perforation) treated with alectinib. Discontinuation of Alecensa in 
patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation should be considered. Patients should be informed of 
the signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal perforations and advised to consult rapidly in case of 
occurrence. 
Photosensitivity 
Photosensitivity to sunlight has been reported with Alecensa administration (see section 4.8). Patients 
should be advised to avoid prolonged sun exposure while taking Alecensa, and for at least 7 days after 
discontinuation of treatment. Patients should also be advised to use a broad-spectrum Ultraviolet A 
(UVA)/ Ultraviolet B (UVB) sun screen and lip balm (sun protection factor [SPF] ≥50) to help protect 
against potential sunburn.   
Women of child-bearing potential 
Alecensa may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Female patients of 
child-bearing potential receiving Alecensa, must use highly effective contraceptive methods during 
treatment and for at least 3 months following the last dose of Alecensa (see sections 4.5, 4.6 and 5.3).  
Lactose intolerance 
This medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose 
intolerance, a congenital lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this 
medicinal product. 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains 48 mg sodium per daily dose (1200 mg), equivalent to 2.4% of the 
WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Effects of other medicinal products on alectinib 
Based on in vitro data, CYP3A4 is the primary enzyme mediating the metabolism of both alectinib 
and its major active metabolite M4, and CYP3A contributes to 40% − 50% of total hepatic 
metabolism. M4 has shown similar in vitro potency and activity against ALK. 
CYP3A inducers 
Co-administration of multiple oral doses of 600 mg rifampicin once daily, a strong CYP3A inducer, 
with a single oral dose of 600 mg alectinib reduced alectinib Cmax, and AUCinf by 51% and 73% 
respectively and increased M4 Cmax and AUCinf 2.20 and 1.79-fold respectively. The effect on the 
combined exposure of alectinib and M4 was minor, reducing Cmax and AUCinf by 4% and 18%, 
respectively. Based on the effects on the combined exposure of alectinib and M4, no dose adjustments 
are required when Alecensa is co-administered with CYP3A inducers. Appropriate monitoring is 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommended for patients taking concomitant strong CYP3A inducers (including, but not limited to, 
carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampicin and St. John’s Wort (Hypericum 
perforatum)). 
CYP3A inhibitors  
Co-administration of multiple oral doses of 400 mg posaconazole twice daily, a strong CYP3A 
inhibitor, with a single oral dose of 300 mg alectinib increased alectinib exposure Cmax and AUCinf by 
1.18 and 1.75-fold respectively, and reduced M4 Cmax and AUCinf by 71% and 25% respectively. The 
effect on the combined exposure of alectinib and M4 was minor, reducing Cmax by 7% and increasing 
AUCinf 1.36-fold. Based on the effects on the combined exposure of alectinib and M4, no dose 
adjustments are required when Alecensa is co-administered with CYP3A inhibitors. Appropriate 
monitoring is recommended for patients taking concomitant strong CYP3A inhibitors (including, but 
not limited to, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, 
posaconazole nefazodone, grapefruit or Seville oranges). 
Medicinal products that increase gastric pH  
Multiple doses of esomeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, 40 mg once daily, demonstrated no 
clinically relevant effect on the combined exposure of alectinib and M4. Therefore, no dose 
adjustments are required when Alecensa is co-administered with proton pump inhibitors or other 
medicinal products which raise gastric pH (e.g. H2 receptor antagonists or antacids). 
Effect of transporters on alectinib disposition 
M4 is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). As alectinib inhibits P-gp, it is not expected that co-
medication with P-gp inhibitors has a relevant effect on M4 exposure. 
Effects of alectinib on other medicinal products 
CYP substrates 
In vitro, alectinib and M4 show weak time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4, and alectinib exhibits a 
weak induction potential of CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 at clinical concentrations.   
Multiple doses of 600 mg alectinib had no influence on the exposure of midazolam (2 mg), a sensitive 
CYP3A substrate. Therefore, no dose adjustment is required for co-administered CYP3A substrates.  
A risk for induction of CYP2B6 and pregnane X receptor (PXR) regulated enzymes apart from 
CYP3A4 cannot be completely excluded. The effectiveness of concomitant administration of oral 
contraceptives may be reduced. 
P-gp substrates 
In vitro, alectinib and its major active metabolite M4 are inhibitors of the efflux transporter  
P-gp. Therefore, alectinib and M4 may have the potential to increase plasma concentrations of co-
administered substrates of P-gp. When Alecensa is co-administered with P-gp substrates (e.g., digoxin, 
dabigatran etexilate, topotecan, sirolimus, everolimus, nilotinib and lapatinib), appropriate monitoring 
is recommended.  
Breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) substrates 
In vitro, alectinib and M4 are inhibitors of the efflux transporter BCRP. Therefore, alectinib and M4 
may have the potential to increase plasma concentrations of co-administered substrates of BCRP. 
When Alecensa is co-administered with BCRP substrates (e.g., methotrexate, mitoxantrone, topotecan 
and lapatinib), appropriate monitoring is recommended.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception  
Women of childbearing potential must be advised to avoid pregnancy while on Alecensa. Female 
patients of child-bearing potential receiving Alecensa must use highly effective contraceptive methods 
during treatment and for at least 3 months following the last dose of Alecensa (see sections 4.4 and 
4.5). 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of alectinib in pregnant women. Based on its 
mechanism of action, alectinib may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  
Female patients, who become pregnant while taking Alecensa or during the 3 months following the 
last dose of Alecensa must contact their doctor and should be advised of the potential harm to the 
foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether alectinib and/or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the 
newborn/infant cannot be excluded. Mothers should be advised against breast-feeding while receiving 
Alecensa. 
Fertility 
No fertility studies in animals have been performed to evaluate the effect of alectinib. No adverse 
effects on male and female reproductive organs were observed in general toxicology studies (see 
section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Alecensa has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Caution should be exercised 
when driving or operating machines as patients may experience symptomatic bradycardia (e.g., 
syncope, dizziness, hypotension) or vision disorders while taking Alecensa (see section 4.8). 
4.8 
Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The data described below reflect exposure to Alecensa in 405 patients with ALK-positive advanced 
NSCLC who participated in one randomised Phase III clinical trial (BO28984) and in two single-arm 
phase II clinical trials (NP28761, NP28673). These patients were treated with the recommended dose 
of 600 mg twice daily. In  the phase II clinical trials (NP28761, NP28673; N=253), the median 
duration of exposure to Alecensa was 11.2 months. In BO28984 (ALEX; N=152) the median duration 
of exposure to Alecensa was 28.1 months, whereas the median duration of exposure to crizotinib was 
10.8 months.  
The most common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (≥ 20%) were constipation, myalgia, oedema, 
anaemia, rash, increased bilirubin and nausea.  
Tabulated list of adverse drug reactions 
Table 3 lists the ADRs occurring in patients who received Alecensa across two phase II clinical trials 
(NP28761, NP28673) and one phase III clinical trial (BO28984; ALEX),  and during post-marketing.  
The ADRs listed in Table 3 are presented by system organ class and frequency categories, defined 
using the following convention: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon 
(≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1000), very rare (<1/10,000). Within each system organ 
class, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing frequency and severity. Within the same 
frequency and severity grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse drug reactions 
The safety profile of Alecensa was generally consistent across the pivotal phase III clinical trial 
BO28984 (ALEX) and phase II trials (NP28761, NP28673). 
Interstitial lung disease (ILD) / pneumonitis  
Severe ILD/pneumonitis occurred in patients treated with Alecensa. Across clinical trials (NP28761, 
NP28673, BO28984), 1 out of 405 patients treated with Alecensa (0.2%) had a Grade 3 ILD. This 
event led to withdrawal from Alecensa treatment. In the phase III clinical trial BO28984, Grade 3 or 4 
ILD/pneumonitis was not observed in patients receiving Alecensa versus 2.0% of patients receiving 
crizotinib. There were no fatal cases of ILD in any of the clinical trials. Patients should be monitored 
for pulmonary symptoms indicative of pneumonitis (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Hepatotoxicity 
Across clinical trials (NP28761, NP28673, BO28984) two patients with Grade 3-4 AST/ALT 
elevations had documented drug induced liver injury by liver biopsy. In addition, one patient 
experienced a Grade 4 adverse event of drug-induced liver injury. Two of these cases led to 
withdrawal from Alecensa treatment. Adverse reactions of increased AST and ALT levels (17% and 
16% respectively) were reported in patients treated with Alecensa across clinical trials (NP28761, 
NP28673, BO28984). The majority of these events were of Grade 1 and 2 intensity, and events of 
Grade ≥ 3 were reported in 3.7% and 3.7% of the patients for increased AST and ALT levels, 
respectively. The events generally occurred during the first 3 months of treatment, were usually 
transient and resolved upon temporary interruption of Alecensa treatment (reported for 1.5% and 3.0% 
of the patients, respectively) or dose reduction (2.0% and 1.5%, respectively). In 1.2% and 1.5% of the 
patients, AST and ALT elevations, respectively, led to withdrawal from Alecensa treatment. Grade 3 
or 4 ALT or AST elevations were each observed in 5% of patients receiving Alecensa versus 16% and 
11% of patients receiving crizotinib in the phase III clinical trial BO28984.  
Adverse reactions of bilirubin elevations were reported in 21% of the patients treated with Alecensa 
across clinical trials (NP28761, NP28673, BO28984). The majority of the events were of Grade 1 and 
2 intensity; Grade 3 events were reported in 3.7% of the patients. The events generally occurred during 
the first 3 months of treatment, were usually transient and the majority resolved upon dose 
modification. In 7.7% of patients, bilirubin elevations led to dose modifications and in 2.0% of 
patients, bilirubin elevations led to withdrawal from Alecensa treatment. In the phase III clinical trial 
BO28984, Grade 3 or 4 bilirubin elevations occurred in 3.9% of patients receiving Alecensa versus no 
patient receiving crizotinib.  
Concurrent elevations in ALT or AST greater than or equal to three times the ULN and total bilirubin 
greater than or equal to two times the ULN, with normal alkaline phosphatase, occurred in one patient 
(0.2%) treated in Alecensa clinical trials. 
Patients should be monitored for liver function including ALT, AST, and total bilirubin as outlined in 
section 4.4 and managed as recommended in section 4.2. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bradycardia  
Cases of bradycardia (11%) of Grade 1 or 2 have been reported in patients treated with Alecensa 
across clinical trials (NP28761, NP28673, BO28984). No patients had events of Grade ≥ 3 severity. 
There were 66 of 365 patients (18%) treated with Alecensa who had post-dose heart rate values below 
50 beats per minutes (bpm). In the phase III clinical trial BO28984 15% of patients treated with 
Alecensa had post-dose heart rate values below 50 bpm versus 21% of patients treated with crizotinib. 
Patients who develop symptomatic bradycardia should be managed as recommended in sections 4.2 
and 4.4. No case of bradycardia led to withdrawal from Alecensa treatment. 
Severe myalgia and CPK elevations  
Cases of myalgia (35%) including myalgia events (23%), musculoskeletal pain (0.5%), and arthralgia 
(19%) have been reported in patients treated with Alecensa across clinical trials (NP28761, NP28673, 
BO28984). The majority of events were Grades 1 or 2 and four patients (1.0%) had a Grade 3 event. 
Dose modifications of Alecensa treatment due to these adverse events were only required for two 
patients (0.5%); Alecensa treatment was not withdrawn due to these events of myalgia. Elevations of 
CPK occurred in 48% of 363 patients with CPK laboratory data available across clinical trials 
(NP28761, NP28673, BO28984) with Alecensa. The incidence of Grade ≥ 3 elevations of CPK was 
4.2%. Median time to Grade ≥ 3 CPK elevation was 14 days across trials (NP28761, NP28673, 
BO28984). Dose modifications for elevation of CPK occurred in 3.5% of patients; withdrawal from 
Alecensa treatment did not occur due to CPK elevations. In the clinical trial BO28984, severe 
arthralgia was reported in one patient (0.7%) in the alectinib arm and in two patients (1.3%) in the 
crizotinib arm. Grade ≥ 3 elevation of CPK was reported for 3.9% of patients receiving Alecensa and 
3.3% of patients receiving crizotinib.   
Haemolytic anaemia 
Cases of haemolytic anaemia have been reported in the post-marketing period, with severity of 
anaemia ranging from Grade 1 to Grade 3. Out of the 30 events with known outcome and known 
action taken with alectinib, the majority (66.7%) recovered or were recovering following a dose 
modification of alectinib; 10.0% recovered without any dose modification. Across the following 
clinical trials (NP28761, NP28673, BO28984, MO29750, BO39694, BO29554 cohort A, YO29449), 2 
out of 716 patients treated with Alecensa (0.3%) experienced non-serious Grade 1 events suggestive of 
haemolytic anaemia. One of these cases led to interruption of Alecensa treatment.  No Grade 4 or 
Grade 5 (fatal) cases of haemolytic anaemia were observed in the clinical trials or in the post-
marketing setting (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Gastrointestinal effects  
Constipation (38%), nausea (20%), diarrhoea (19%) and vomiting (14%) were the most commonly 
reported gastrointestinal (GI) reactions. Most of these events were of mild or moderate severity; 
Grade 3 events were reported for diarrhea (1.0%), nausea (0.5%), vomiting (0.2%), and constipation 
(0.2%). These events did not lead to withdrawal from Alecensa treatment. Median time to onset for 
constipation, nausea, diarrhea, and/or vomiting events across clinical trials (NP28761, NP28673, 
BO28984) was 22 days. The events declined in frequency after the first month of treatment. In the 
phase III clinical trial BO28984, Grade 3 and 4 events of nausea, diarrhoea and constipation were 
reported in one patient each (0.7%) in the alectinib arm and the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 events of 
nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting was 3.3%, 2.0% and 3.3%, respectively, in the crizotinib arm.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V 
4.9  Overdose 
Patients who experience overdose should be closely supervised and general supportive care instituted. 
There is no specific antidote for overdose with Alecensa.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: anti-neoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitor; ATC code:L01ED03. 
Mechanism of action 
Alectinib is a highly selective and potent ALK and rearranged during transfection (RET) tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor. In pre-clinical studies, inhibition of ALK tyrosine kinase activity led to blockage of 
downstream signalling pathways including signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT 3) 
and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) and induction of tumour cell death 
(apoptosis). 
Alectinib demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity against mutant forms of the ALK enzyme, 
including mutations responsible for resistance to crizotinib. The major metabolite of alectinib (M4) 
has shown similar in vitro potency and activity.  
Based on preclinical data, alectinib is not a substrate of P-gp or BCRP, which are both efflux 
transporters in the blood brain barrier, and is therefore able to distribute into and be retained within the 
central nervous system.  
Clinical efficacy and safety  
ALK positive non-small cell lung cancer 
Treatment-naïve patients 
The safety and efficacy of Alecensa were studied in a global randomised Phase III open label clinical 
trial (BO28984, ALEX) in ALK-positive NSCLC patients who were treatment naïve. Central testing 
for ALK protein expression positivity of tissue samples from all patients by Ventana anti-ALK (D5F3) 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) was required before randomisation into the study. 
A total of 303 patients were included in the Phase III trial, 151 patients randomised to the crizotinib 
arm and 152 patients randomised to the Alecensa arm receiving Alecensa orally, at the recommended 
dose of 600 mg twice daily.  
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ((ECOG PS) (0/1 vs. 2)), race (Asian vs. 
non-Asian), and central nervous system (CNS) metastases at baseline (yes vs. no) were stratification 
factors for randomisation. The primary endpoint of the trial was to demonstrate superiority of 
Alecensa versus crizotinib based on Progression Free survival (PFS) as per investigator assessment 
using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Baseline demographic and 
disease characteristics for Alecensa were median age 58 years (54 years for crizotinib), 55% female 
(58% for crizotinib), 55% non-Asian (54% for crizotinib), 61% with no smoking history (65% for 
crizotinib), 93% ECOG PS of 0 or 1 (93% for crizotinib), 97% Stage IV disease (96% for crizotinib), 
90% adenocarcinoma histology (94% for crizotinib), 40% CNS metastases at baseline (38% for 
crizotinib) and 17% having received prior CNS radiation (14% for crizotinib).  
The trial met its primary endpoint at the primary analysis, demonstrating a statistically significant 
improvement in PFS by investigator. Efficacy data are summarised in Table 4 and the Kaplan-Meier 
curve for investigator assessed PFS is shown in Figure 1.

Crizotinib pre-treated patients 
The safety and efficacy of Alecensa in ALK-positive NSCLC patients pre-treated with crizotinib were 
studied in two Phase I/II clinical trials (NP28673 and NP28761).  
NP28673 
Study NP28673 was a Phase I/II single arm, multicentre study conducted in patients with 
ALK-positive advanced NSCLC who have previously progressed on crizotinib treatment. In addition 
to crizotinib, patients may have received previous treatment with chemotherapy. A total of 
138 patients were included in the phase II part of the study and received Alecensa orally, at the 
recommended dose of 600 mg twice daily.  
The primary endpoint was to evaluate the efficacy of Alecensa by Objective Response Rate (ORR) as 
per central Independent Review Committee (IRC) assessment using RECIST version 1.1 in the overall 
population (with and without prior exposure of cytotoxic chemotherapy treatments). The co-primary 
endpoint was to evaluate the ORR as per central IRC assessment using RECIST 1.1 in patients with 
prior exposure of cytotoxic chemotherapy treatments. A lower confidence limit for the estimated ORR 
above the pre-specified threshold of 35% would achieve a statistically significant result. 
Patient demographics were consistent with that of a NSCLC ALK positive population. The 
demographic characteristics of the overall study population were 67% Caucasian, 26% Asian, 56% 
females, and the median age was 52 years. The majority of patients had no history of smoking (70%). 
The ECOG PS at baseline was 0 or 1 in 90.6% of patients and 2 in 9.4% of patients. At the time of 
entry in the study, 99% of patients had stage IV disease, 61% had brain metastases and in 96% of 
patients tumours were classified as adenocarcinoma. Among patients included in the study, 20% of the 
patients had previously progressed on crizotinib treatment only, and 80% had previously progressed 
on crizotinib and at least one chemotherapy treatment.   
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Study NP28761 
Study NP28761 was a Phase I/II single arm multicentre study conducted in patients with ALK positive 
advanced NSCLC who have previously progressed on crizotinib treatment. In addition to crizotinib, 
patients may have received previous treatment with chemotherapy. A total of 87 patients were 
included in the phase II part of the study and received Alecensa orally, at the recommended dose of 
600 mg twice daily.  
The primary endpoint was to evaluate the efficacy of Alecensa by ORR as per central IRC assessment 
using RECIST version 1.1. A lower confidence limit for the estimated ORR above the pre-specified 
threshold of 35% would achieve a statistically significant result. 
Patient demographics were consistent with that of a NSCLC ALK positive population. The 
demographic characteristics of the overall study population were 84% Caucasian, 8% Asian, 55% 
females. The median age was 54 years. The majority of patients had no history of smoking (62%). The 
ECOG PS at baseline was 0 or 1 in 89.7% of patients and 2 in 10.3% of patients. At the time of entry 
in the study, 99% of patients had stage IV disease, 60% had brain metastases and in 94% of patients 
tumours were classified as adenocarcinoma. Among the patients included in the study, 26% of the 
patients had previously progressed on crizotinib treatment only, and 74% had previously progressed 
on crizotinib and at least one chemotherapy treatment.  
The main efficacy results from studies NP28673 and NP28761 are summarised in Table 5. A summary 
of pooled analysis of CNS endpoints is presented in Table 6.

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Alecensa in all subsets of the paediatric population in lung carcinoma (small cell and non-small cell 
carcinoma) (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetic parameters for alectinib and its major active metabolite (M4) have been 
characterised in ALK-positive NSCLC patients and healthy subjects. Based on population 
pharmacokinetic analysis, the geometric mean (coefficient of variation %) steady-state Cmax, Cmin and 
AUC0-12hr for alectinib were approximately 665 ng/mL (44.3%), 572 ng/mL (47.8%) and 7430 
ng*h/mL (45.7%), respectively. The geometric mean steady-state Cmax, Cmin and AUC0-12hr for M4 
were approximately 246 ng/mL (45.4%), 222 ng/mL (46.6%) and 2810 ng*h/mL (45.9%), 
respectively. 
Absorption 
Following oral administration of 600 mg twice daily under fed conditions in ALK-positive NSCLC 
patients, alectinib was absorbed reaching Tmax after approximately 4 to 6 hours.  
Alectinib steady-state is reached within 7 days with continuous 600 mg twice daily dosing. The 
accumulation ratio for the twice-daily 600 mg regimen was approximately 6-fold. Population PK 
analysis supports dose proportionality for alectinib across the dose range of 300 to 900 mg under fed 
conditions. 
The absolute bioavailability of alectinib capsules was 36.9% (90% CI: 33.9%, 40.3%) under fed 
conditions in healthy subjects. 
Following a single oral administration of 600 mg with a high-fat, high-calorie meal, alectinib and M4 
exposure was increased by around 3-fold relative to fasted conditions (see section 4.2).  
Distribution 
Alectinib and its major metabolite M4 are highly bound to human plasma proteins (>99%), 
independent of active substance concentration. The mean in vitro human blood-to-plasma 
concentration ratios of alectinib and M4 are 2.64 and 2.50, respectively, at clinically relevant 
concentrations. 
The geometric mean volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) of alectinib following intravenous (IV) 
administration was 475 L, indicating extensive distribution into tissues. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on in vitro data, alectinib is not a substrate of P-gp. Alectinib and M4 are not substrates of 
BCRP or organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1/B3. 
Biotransformation 
In vitro metabolism studies showed that CYP3A4 is the main CYP isozyme mediating alectinib and its 
major metabolite M4 metabolism, and is estimated to contribute 40-50% of alectinib metabolism. 
Results from the human mass balance study demonstrated that alectinib and M4 were the main 
circulating moieties in plasma with 76% of the total radioactivity in plasma. The geometric mean 
Metabolite/Parent ratio at steady state is 0.399. 
Metabolite M1b was detected as a minor metabolite from in vitro and in human plasma in healthy 
subjects. Formation of metabolite M1b and its minor isomer M1a is likely to be catalyzed by a 
combination of CYP isozymes (including isozymes other than CYP3A) and aldehyde dehydrogenase 
(ALDH) enzymes. 
In vitro studies indicate that neither alectinib nor its major active metabolite (M4) inhibits CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 at clinically relevant concentrations. Alectinib did not 
inhibit OATP1B1/OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3 or OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations in vitro. 
Elimination 
Following administration of a single dose of 14C-labeled alectinib administered orally to healthy 
subjects the majority of radioactivity was excreted in faeces (mean recovery 97.8%) with minimal 
excretion in urine (mean recovery 0.46%). In faeces, 84% and 5.8% of the dose was excreted as 
unchanged alectinib or M4, respectively.    
Based on a population PK analysis, the apparent clearance (CL/F) of alectinib was 81.9 L/hour. The 
geometric mean of the individual elimination half-life estimates for alectinib was 32.5 hours. The 
corresponding values for M4 were 217 L/hour and 30.7 hours, respectively.  
Pharmacokinetics in special populations 
Renal impairment 
Negligible amounts of alectinib and the active metabolite M4 are excreted unchanged in urine (< 0.2% 
of the dose). Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis alectinib and M4 exposures were similar 
in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment and normal renal function. The pharmacokinetics 
of alectinib has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
As elimination of alectinib is predominantly through metabolism in the liver, hepatic impairment may 
increase the plasma concentration of alectinib and/or its major metabolite M4. Based on a population 
pharmacokinetic analysis, alectinib and M4 exposures were similar in patients with mild hepatic 
impairment and normal hepatic function.  
Following administration of a single oral dose of 300 mg alectinib in subjects with severe (Child-Pugh 
C) hepatic impairment, alectinib Cmax was the same and AUCinf was 2.2-fold higher compared with the 
same parameters in matched healthy subjects. M4 Cmax and AUCinf was 39% and 34% lower 
respectively, resulting in a combined exposure of alectinib and M4 (AUCinf) 1.8-fold higher in patients 
with severe hepatic impairment compared with matched healthy subjects.  
The hepatic impairment study also included a group with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic 
impairment, and a modestly higher alectinib exposure was observed in this group compared with 
matched healthy subjects. The subjects in the Child Pugh B group however did in general not suffer 
from abnormal bilirubin, albumin or prothrombin time, indicating that they may not be fully 
representative of moderately hepatically impaired subjects with decreased metabolic capacity.

Effects of age, body weight, race and gender 
Age, body weight, race and gender had no clinically meaningful effect on the systemic exposure of 
alectinib and M4. The range of body weights for patients enrolled in clinical studies is 36.9-123 kg. 
There are no available data on patients with extreme body weight (>130 kg) (see section 4.2). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed to establish the carcinogenic potential of alectinib. 
Mutagenicity 
Alectinib was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay but induced a 
slight increase in numerical aberrations in the in vitro cytogenetic assay using Chinese Hamster Lung 
(CHL) cells with metabolic activation, and micronuclei in a rat bone marrow micronucleus test. The 
mechanism of micronucleus induction was abnormal chromosome segregation (aneugenicity), and not 
a clastogenic effect on chromosomes. 
Impairment of fertility 
No fertility studies in animals have been performed to evaluate the effect of alectinib. No adverse 
effects on male and female reproductive organs were observed in general toxicology studies. These 
studies were conducted in rats and monkeys at exposures equal to or greater than 2.6- and 0.5-fold, 
respectively, of the human exposure, measured by area under the curve (AUC), at the recommended 
dose of 600 mg twice daily. 
Teratogenicity 
Alectinib caused embryo-foetal toxicity in pregnant rats and rabbits. In pregnant rats, alectinib caused 
total embryo-foetal loss (miscarriage) at exposures 4.5-fold of the human AUC exposure and small 
foetuses with retarded ossification and minor abnormalities of the organs at exposures 2.7-fold of the 
human AUC exposure. In pregnant rabbits, alectinib caused embryo-foetal loss, small fetuses and 
increased incidence of skeletal variations at exposures 2.9-fold of the human AUC exposure at the 
recommended dose. 
Other 
Alectinib absorbs ultraviolet (UV) light between 200 and 400 nm and demonstrated a phototoxic 
potential in an in vitro photosafety test in cultured murine fibroblasts after UVA irradiation. 
Target organs in both rat and monkey at clinically relevant exposures in the repeat-dose toxicology 
studies included, but were not limited to the erythroid system, gastrointestinal tract, and hepatobiliary 
system.  
Abnormal erythrocyte morphology was observed at exposures equal or greater than 10-60% the 
human exposure by AUC at the recommended dose. Proliferative zone extension in gastrointestinal 
(GI) mucosa in both species was observed at exposures equal to or greater than 20-120% of the human 
AUC exposure at the recommended dose. Increased hepatic alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and direct 
bilirubin as well as vacuolation/degeneration/necrosis of bile duct epithelium and enlargement/focal 
necrosis of hepatocytes was observed in rats and/or monkeys at exposures equal to or greater than 20-
30% of the human exposure by AUC at the recommended dose.  
A mild hypotensive effect has been observed in monkeys at around clinically relevant exposures.

important information for you. 
●  Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.

1. 
What Alecensa is and what it is used for 
What Alecensa is 
Alecensa is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance alectinib. 
What Alecensa is used for 
Alecensa is used to treat adults with a type of lung cancer called ‘non-small cell lung cancer’ 
(‘NSCLC’). It is used if your lung cancer: 
●  is ‘ALK-positive’ - this means your cancer cells have a fault in a gene that makes an enzyme called 
ALK (‘anaplastic lymphoma kinase’), see ‘How Alecensa works’, below 
●  and is advanced. 
Alecensa can be prescribed to you as first treatment of your lung cancer, or if you have been 
previously treated with a medicine containing ‘crizotinib’. 
How Alecensa works 
Alecensa blocks the action of an enzyme called ‘ALK tyrosine kinase’. Abnormal forms of this 
enzyme (due to fault in the gene that makes it) help encourage cancer cell growth. Alecensa may slow 
down or stop the growth of your cancer. It may also help to shrink your cancer. 
If you have any questions about how Alecensa works or why this medicine has been prescribed for 
you, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. 
What you need to know before you take Alecensa  
Do not take Alecensa 
●  if you are allergic to alectinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Alecensa. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Alecensa: 
●  if you have ever had stomach or intestine problems as holes (perforation), or if you have conditions 
causing inflammation inside the abdomen (diverticulitis), or if you have spread of cancer inside the 
abdomen (metastasis). It is possible that Alecensa may increase the risk of developing holes in the 
wall of your gut. 
●  if you have an inherited problem called ‘galactose intolerance’, ‘congenital lactase deficiency’ or 
‘glucose-galactose malabsorption’. 
If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Alecensa. 
Talk to your doctor right away after having taken Alecensa:  
●  if you are experiencing severe stomach or abdominal pain, fever, chills, sickness, vomiting, or     
abdominal rigidity or bloating, as these could be symptoms of a hole in the wall of your gut. 
Alecensa can cause side effects that you need to tell your doctor about straight away. These include: 
●  liver injury (hepatotoxicity). Your doctor will take blood tests before you start treatment, then 
every 2 weeks for the first 3 months of your treatment and then less often. This is to check you do 
not have any liver problems while taking Alecensa. Tell your doctor straight away if you get any of 
the following signs: yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes, pain on the right side of 
your stomach area, dark urine, itchy skin, feeling less hungry than usual, nausea or vomiting, 
feeling tired, bleeding or bruising more easily than normal. 
●  slow heart beat (bradycardia).  
●  lung inflammation (pneumonitis). Alecensa may cause severe or life-threatening swelling 
(inflammation) of the lungs during treatment. The signs may be similar to those from your lung 
cancer. Tell your doctor straight away if you have any new or worsening signs including difficulty 
in breathing, shortness of breath, or cough with or without mucous, or fever.  
●  severe muscle pain, tenderness, and weakness (myalgia). Your doctor will do blood tests at least 
every 2 weeks for the first month and as needed during treatment with Alecensa. Tell your doctor 
straight away if you get new or worsening signs of muscle problems, including unexplained muscle 
pain or muscle pain that does not go away, tenderness, or weakness. 
●  abnormal  breakdown of red blood cells (haemolytic anaemia). Tell your doctor straight away if 
you feel tired, weak or short of breath.  
Look out for these while you are taking Alecensa. See ‘Side effects’ in section 4 for more information.

Do not expose yourself to the sun for any long period of time while you are taking Alecensa and for 
7 days after you stop. You need to apply sunscreen and lip balm with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 
50 or higher to help prevent sunburn. 
Tests and checks 
When you take Alecensa your doctor will do blood tests before you start treatment, then every 2 weeks 
for the first 3 months of your treatment and then less often. This is to check you do not have any liver 
or muscle problems while taking Alecensa.

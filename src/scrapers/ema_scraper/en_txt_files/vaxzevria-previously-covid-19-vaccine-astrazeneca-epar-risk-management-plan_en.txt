Brief description of the 
product
Chemical class:
Recombinant replication-deficient viral vector vaccine
Summary of mode of action:
Vaxzevria is a monovalent vaccine composed of a single recombinant, 
replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAdOx1) vector encoding the 
S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 S immunogen in the 
vaccine is expressed in the trimeric pre-fusion conformation; the coding 
sequence has not been modified in order to stabilise the expressed S-protein in 
the pre-fusion conformation. Following administration, the S glycoprotein of 
SARS-CoV-2 is expressed locally stimulating neutralising antibody and 
cellular immune responses.
Important information about its composition:
Vaxzevria is produced in genetically modified human embryonic kidney 
(HEK) 293 cells and by recombinant DNA technology. 
List of excipients: L-Histidine, L-Histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, 
magnesium chloride hexahydrate, polysorbate 80, ethanol, sucrose, sodium 
chloride, disodium edetate dihydrate, and water for injections.

II.1.1
Prevention of COVID-19
Incidence
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel infectious disease, caused by SARS-CoV-2.
Prevalence
Since the first reports of COVID-19, infection has spread worldwide, prompting the World 
Health Organization (WHO) to declare a public health emergency in late January 2020 (WHO 
2020a) and characterise SARS-CoV-2 as a pandemic in March 2020 (WHO 2020b). As of 06 
June 2023, over 767 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection have been diagnosed 
globally with more than 6.9 million deaths (WHO 2023b). By 14 June 2023, there had been 
over 249.54 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection and over 2.09 million deaths in 
the EU/European Economic Area (Our World in Data 2023a). According to a statement made 
on 5 May 2023, more than 3 years into the pandemic, the WHO Emergency Committee on 
COVID-19 recommended to the Director-General, who accepted the recommendation, that 
given the disease is now an established and ongoing health issue, it no longer fits the 
definition of a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). This does not mean 
the pandemic itself is over, but that it is no longer considered a global emergency. A Review 
Committee to be established will develop long-term, standing recommendations for countries 
on how to manage COVID-19 on an ongoing basis (WHO 2023).
COVID-19 variants
During the course of the pandemic, several SARS‐CoV‐2 variants of concern with different 
patterns of infectivity have emerged (Joshi and Poduri 2022; Saban et al 2022; Zhao et al 
2022). The Delta variant was the major epidemic strain around the world in 2021. The 
Omicron variant replaced the Delta variant as the major strain from the beginning of 2022. A 
2023 review of data across 50 countries reported a median incidence rate of 17.14 per 100,000 
people during the Delta variant period and 61.66 per 100,000 people during the Omicron 
variant period (Wang et al 2023). AstraZeneca conducts continuous and thorough reviews of 
genomic databases such as GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) for 
emerging Variants of Interest and Variants of Concern.
Demographics of the population in the proposed indication (age, gender, racial and 
ethnic origin), and risk factors for the disease
Individuals of any age can acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection, although the risk of severe illness 
due to COVID-19 increases with age. Early epidemiological studies suggest that acute

COVID-19 occurs at a lower frequency in patients < 18 years old than in adults (CDC 2020a, 
Livingston and Bucher 2020, Wu and McGoogan 2020), with a smaller percentage of children 
with COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation or intensive care unit admission relative to adults 
(CDC 2020a, ECDC 2022 a). Patients with COVID-19 can experience a wide range of 
symptoms from mild to critical illness (ECDC 2022 a). Older adults, males, and persons with 
chronic medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic 
liver disease, cancer, obesity, diabetes, pre-existing hypertension, pulmonary disease, 
immunosuppression, and sickle cell disease, are at increased risk of disease severity and/or 
mortality (Gallo Marin et al 2020, Beaney et al 2022 and ECDC 2022b). 
The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is comparable among men and women; however, 
men may have a slightly higher risk of more severe illness and higher mortality from COVID-
19 than women (Beaney et al 2022, ECDC 2023, Gebhard et al 2020). Studies from the US 
have also reported increased mortality with COVID-19 in males relative to female patients 
(Finelli 2021). In the USA, non-Hispanic American Indian, Alaska Native, and Black and 
Hispanic persons have been disproportionally affected (Tian et al 2020, Williamson et al 
2020, Zheng et al 2020). Ethnicity (particularly non-white ethnicity) has been recognized as a 
predictor for more severe disease, and/or risk of hospitalisation in numerous studies (Gao 
2021, Beaney et al 2022). Recent evidence suggests that racial disparities in COVID-19 risk
were more pronounced in the early waves of the pandemic, and that such association is 
mediated mainly by community-level socioeconomic status, contact with suspected or 
confirmed COVID-19 cases, and lack of access to clinical care (Lo et al 2021, Magesh et al 
2021).
The main existing treatment options
Pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylaxis
In December 2020, the first COVID-19 vaccine candidate (COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine 
BNT162b2) was authorised in the UK on a temporary basis under Regulation 174 of the 
Human Medicine Regulations 2012 and granted conditional marketing authorisation in the EU 
for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus in individuals 
≥ 16 years of age. That same month, Vaxzevria (previously COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca) 
temporary authorisation was also issued under UK Regulation 174 for individuals ≥ 18 years 
of age. In January 2021, Vaxzevria and COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna were granted 
conditional marketing authorisation in the EU for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 
caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus in individuals ≥ 18 years of age. Conditional marketing 
authorisation in the EU was also granted for COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen in March 2021 and 
for Nuvaxovid COVID-19 Vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) (Novavax CZ a.s.) in 
December 2021. Subsequently, and as of 02 December 2022, at least 11 different vaccines, 
utilizing 4 platforms, have been administered globally (WHO 2022). As of October 2022, 172
candidate vaccines are in clinical development and 199 are in pre-clinical investigation (WHO 
2022a).

On 11 December 2020, FDA issued the first emergency use authorization (EUA) of Pfizer-
BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (Comirnaty) for the prevention of COVID-19 in individuals 16 
years of age and older. On 18 December 2020, FDA issued an EUA for Moderna COVID-19 
Vaccine (Spikevax) for the prevention of COVID-19 in individuals 18 years of age and older. 
EUA was also issued Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine in February 2021 (FDA 2022).
Currently, 8 and 9 COVID-19 vaccines are authorised for use in the European Union (EU) and 
United Kingdom (UK), respectively, including originally authorised and adapted vaccines 
(EMA 2023a, UK Health Security Agency 2023). The following drugs are authorised for 
either pre-exposure prophylaxis and/or treatment in the EU/UK: EVUSHELD (tixagevimab / 
cilgavimab); Kineret (anakinra); PAXLOVID (nirmatrelvir / ritonavir); REGKIRONA 
(regdanvimab); RoActemra; RONAPREVE (casirivimab / imdevimab); XEVUDY 
(sotrovimab), VEKLURY (remdesivir), and LAGEVRIO (molnupiravir) (EMA 2023a and 
NHS 2023).
Management of persons with COVID-19
Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection can experience a range of clinical manifestations, from 
no symptoms to critical illness. Earlier in the clinical course of disease when SARS-CoV-2 
replication is greatest or soon after symptom onset, antivirals and monoclonal antibody 
therapies are likely to be most effective. Later, anti-inflammatory drugs and 
immunomodulators may be used to stabilize the hyperinflammatory state that can accompany 
of COVID-19 in some patients (Cascella et al 2022).
Individuals with mild COVID-19 are managed in the ambulatory setting with supportive care 
and isolation. Closer monitoring over the time course of those with mild disease is advised for 
the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions. Where authorized, monoclonal antibody 
therapies can be considered for outpatients who are at risk of disease progression (Cascella et 
al 2022). As of October 2022, CHMP has granted marketing authorizations for 3 mAbs 
[XEVUDY (sotrovimab), REGKIRONA (regdanvimab), and RONAPREVE 
(casirivimab/imdevimab)] in the treatment of COVID-19 in patients who do not require 
supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk of progressing to severe COVID-19. The 
antiviral drugs nirmatrelvir with ritonavir (PAXLOVID) and remdesivir (VEKLURY) are 
authorised or approved for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in patients who are at 
increased risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 (FDA 2022, FDA 2023a, EMA 2023a).
Currently, authorized vaccines continue to be effective at preventing hospitalisation, severe 
disease, and death due to COVID-19. However, protection against infection wanes over time 
and as new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge. Large cohort studies on VE indicate that bivalent 
Wuhan-BA.4/5 vaccines offer an increased protection versus monovalent Wuhan vaccines 
against severe disease with Omicron BA.4.6, BA.5, BQ.1, and BQ.1.1 (ICMRA 2023).

Based on the available data, both the EMA and the United States Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) have recommended monovalent XBB-lineage vaccine for use during 
the upcoming 2023 to 2024 vaccination campaigns (EMA 2023b, FDA 2023b).
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity
SARS-CoV-2 infection can be classified into 6 distinct types including asymptomatic, pre-
symptomatic infection, as well as mild, moderate, severe and critical illness. Transmission of 
SARS-CoV-2 may occur from pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic or symptomatic individuals 
(Cascella et al 2022). Early evidence suggested that viral transmission was possible from 
asymptomatic individuals (CDC 2020b, Lavezzo et al 2020, Oran and Topol 2020). Estimated 
rates of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, vary widely with significant 
heterogeneity between studies, with an Interquartile Range (IQR) of estimates across 130 
studies ranging of 14% to 50% (prediction interval 2% to 90%) (Buitrago-Garcia 2022).
Symptomatic patients can experience a range of symptoms from mild to critical illness, with 
shifts in patterns of reported symptoms relative to dominant variants throughout the pandemic 
(Schulze 2022). Based on a large cohort study of > 44000 persons with confirmed COVID-19 
during the early stages of the pandemic in China, the majority of patients experienced mild to 
moderate illness (Wu and McGoogan 2020):
 Mild (mild symptoms up to mild pneumonia): 81%
Severe (dyspnoea, hypoxia, or > 50% lung involvement on imaging): 14%

 Critical (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan system dysfunction): 5%
These early data are consistent with a meta-analysis including > 280000 persons from 11 
countries/regions which estimated the proportion of individuals with severe (and critical) 
disease as 22.9% (Li 2021). It is worth noting that patterns of clinical outcomes have been 
changing throughout the pandemic and along the changing landscape of dominant variants of 
concern, the widespread use of COVID-19 vaccines, and the improvement in both early 
detection and management of symptomatic cases. For example, recent research suggested a 
shift towards atypical but less severe clinical presentation with omicron vs. delta variants 
(Menni et al 2022).
Overall, among Chinese patients who developed severe illness, the median time to dyspnoea 
ranged from 5 to 8 days, the median time to ARDS ranged from 8 to 12 days, and the median 
time ICU admission ranged from 10 to 12 days (Huang et al 2020, Wang et al 2020, Yang et 
al 2020, Zhou et al 2020). Among all hospitalised patients, a range of 26% to 32% of patients 
were admitted to the ICU. Among all patients, a range of 3% to 17% developed ARDS 
compared to a range of 20% to 42% for hospitalised patients and 67% to 85% for patients 
admitted to the ICU. Overall mortality was estimated in a large meta-analysis as 5.6% (Li 
2021), with much higher mortality among patients admitted to the ICU ranges from 39% to 
16 of 97

Version: 8
72% depending on the study, with improvements seen in ICU mortality over the course of the 
pandemic (Dennis 2021). The median length of hospitalisation among survivors was 10 to 13 
days (Chen et al 2020, Guan et al 2020, Huang et al 2020, Wang et al 2020, Wu et al 2020a, 
Yang et al 2020).
Data from the SEMI-COVID registry in Spain (a retrospective, multi centre national cohort 
study) demonstrated that immunosuppressed patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 had 
significantly longer hospital stays than those without immunosuppression (median 10 days vs 
9 days) (Suárez-García et al 2021). Immune suppression in this study was also associated with 
60% higher rates of COVID-19-associated mortality compared to patients without 
immunosuppression, further highlighting the vulnerability of this population to SARS-CoV-2 
(Suárez-García et al 2021).
It is worth noting that patterns of clinical outcomes have been changing throughout the 
pandemic, along with the changing landscape of dominant Variants of Concern, the 
widespread use of COVID-19 vaccines, and the improvement in both early detection and 
management of symptomatic cases. Recent research suggests a shift towards less severe 
clinical presentation with Omicron vs Delta variants (Greene et al 2023; Menni et al 2022; 
Zhao et al 2023). According to a recent review based on reports issued by the WHO and Our 
World in Data (OWID), the case fatality rate decreased from 8.56 per 1000 persons during the 
Delta variant period to 3.04 per 1000 during the Omicron variant period, due to the decreased 
pathogenicity of Omicron and increased vaccination coverage (Wang et al 2023).
Complications associated with COVID-19
 Acute respiratory distress syndrome is the major complication in patients with severe
disease and can manifest shortly after the onset of dyspnoea. Approximately 12% to 24%
of hospitalised patients have required mechanical ventilation (Petrilli et al 2020,
Richardson et al 2020, Yang et al 2020).
 Arrhythmias, acute cardiac injury, cardiomyopathy, shock, and myocarditis (Arentz et al
2020, Cao et al 2020, Chen et al 2020, Wang et al 2020, Keller et al 2023).
 Acute myocardial infarction especially in patients with severe systemic inflammation and

hypercoagulability due to COVID-19 (Long et al 2020).
Thromboembolic complications, including pulmonary embolism and acute stroke and
acute limb ischaemia (Danzi et al 2020, Klok et al 2020, Mao et al 2020, Zhang et al 2020
and Galyfos et al 2022).

Large vessel thromboembolisms have also been reported in patients < 50 years of age
without risk factors (Oxley et al 2020)
 Meta-analyses of studies reporting prevalence of venous thromboembolisms in patients with
COVID-19 reported a pooled prevalence of PE of 21% (n=36 studies) to 32% (n = 17
studies) and a pooled prevalence of deep vein thrombosis of 27% (n = 32 studies) (Gong et al
2022, Kollias 2021).


Incidence of stroke in COVID-19 patients ranged from 0.4% to 8.1% across 24 cohort
studies, with a pooled estimate of stroke occurring in 1.4% of patients with COVID-19
(Nannoni et al 2021).
 Haematological complications including thrombocytopenia and complications including
thrombocytopenia and neutrophilia are a hallmark of severe disease (Coopersmith 2021).
Hypercoagulability in COVID-19 is well known. Although the exact mechanisms are
unclear, it is thought to be linked to cytokine-induced inflammatory response (Abou-
Ismail 2020).
Laboratory evidence of an increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, similar to
cytokine release syndrome, with persistent fevers, elevated inflammatory markers (eg, D
dimer, ferritin), and elevated proinflammatory cytokines have been associated with
critical and fatal illnesses (Huang et al 2020, Mehta et al 2020).

 Central and peripheral nervous system complications including Guillain-Barré syndrome
(Paterson et al 2020), encephalopathy (Helms et al 2020), meningo encephalitis
(Moriguchi et al 2020), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (Paterson et al 2020), and
acute necrotizing encephalopathy (Poyiadji et al 2020).
 Neurologic complications, in particular encephalopathy manifesting with agitated delirium,
was common in patients with critical illness.
 Delirium/encephalopathy was reported in approximately two thirds of patients with COVID-
19-related ARDS (Helms et al 2020).

 Multisystem inflammatory syndrome with clinical features similar to those of Kawasaki
disease and toxic shock syndrome has been described in children with COVID-19
(Kabeerdoss et al 2021, Licciardi et al 2020) and adults in with COVID-19 (Patel et al
2021).
Secondary infections and bacterial or fungal coinfections were reported in 7.5-8% of
patients; these included mainly respiratory infections and bacteraemia (Nakagawara et al
2023, Rawson et al 2020). Several reports of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis among
immunocompetent patients with ARDS from COVID-19 have been described (Koehler et
al 2020, Rutsaert et al 2020).
Psychotic symptoms have been related to other CoV infections. Structured delusions
mixed with confusional features were the most frequent psychiatric manifestations
observed in the COVID-19 patients. Psychotic symptoms were seen in patients with no
previous history of psychosis (Parra et al 2020, Rogers et al 2020, Varatharaj et al 2020).
In a large analysis of electronic health records, the risk of psychiatric outcomes including
dementia, mood, anxiety or psychotic disorders were significantly higher in the 6 months
following COVID-19 than compared to influenza or other respiratory tract infection
(Taquet 2021).

 COVID-19-associated acute kidney injury has been found to occur in 4.3% to 30.5% of
COVID-19 patients, the most common risk factors for the development of COVID-19-
associated acute kidney injury were diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic kidney
disease, cardiovascular disease, age, and male sex (Fu et al 2020; Mallhi et al 2022; Xu et
al 2021).
Long-term complications of COVID-19 (post-acute sequelae) can develop following
infection of any severity, affecting up to 1 in 5 people following acute illness from

COVID-19. Although sequalae are chronic and often debilitating, long COVID remains 
poorly characterized in current COVID-19 prevention and treatment strategies (Iqbal 
2021). Multiple organ systems can be affected, including respiratory, cardiovascular, 
nervous system, musculoskeletal, cutaneous and neuropsychiatric manifestations 
(Aiyegbusi et al 2021, Ballering et al 2022).
According to early research, the average recovery time from COVID-19 is approximately 2 
weeks for mild illness and 3 to 6 weeks for severe illness, with wide ranges dependent on risk 
factors and comorbidities (WHO 2022). More recent data suggest that duration of disease is 
highly variable, with recovery time dependent on risk factors (including age) and 
comorbidities (Mizrahi 2020). Duration of symptoms may be higher in individuals with 
suboptimal immune responses (Dreyer 2021).
Important comorbidities
The risk for severe illness from COVID-19 increases with age, particularly in adults aged 70 
years and older (Chatterjee et al 2023,Wu et al 2020b). In addition, proposed comorbidities 
associated with COVID 19 severity and mortality include: cardiovascular disease, chronic 
kidney disease, obesity, diabetes, pulmonary disease, Parkinson’s disease and other 
neurological disorders, immunosuppression (immunosuppressive disease, immunosuppressive 
medications), immunocompromised state (from solid organ transplant, blood or bone marrow 
transplant, immune deficiencies, human immunodeficiency virus), sickle cell disease, cancer, 
chronic liver disease, renal failure, and fluid and electrolyte disorders (
ACEP 2020, Gallo Marin et al 2020, Appelman et al 2022, Chatterjee et al 2023, Nogueira et 
al 2022). As a result, elderly individuals, and those with these underlying comorbidities were 
prioritised for vaccination following AZD1222 marketing approval.

MODULE SII: NON-CLINICAL PART OF THE SAFETY 
SPECIFICATION
II.2.1
Summary of key findings from non-clinical data
Key safety findings from non-clinical studies and their relevance to human usage are 
described below.
Toxicity
Key issues identified from acute or repeat-dose toxicity studies
A repeat-dose Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicity study with AZD1222 in mice was 
conducted (Study 513351), with findings (including recovery data) indicating that there were 
no clinically relevant observations considered to be related to administration of AZD1222.
Furthermore, as the ChAdOx1 platform technology utilised for AZD1222 is well 
characterised, non-clinical toxicology findings with the ChAdOx1 MERS-CoV vaccine 
expressing the full-length spike (S) protein in mice are also considered of direct relevance to 
the non-clinical safety profile of AZD1222. Additionally, results from toxicology studies on 
similar replication-defective ChAd vaccines (ChAdOx1 NP+M1 and AdCh63 MSP-1) are also 
considered to be of significance.
Results from repeat-dose mouse toxicology studies with vaccines ChAdOx1 NP+M1 and 
AdCh63 MSP-1 were consistent with ChAdOx1 MERS and demonstrated that these vaccines 
were well tolerated with no associated adverse effects. Toxicity data (and toxicity in the target 
organs) from the ChAdOx1- and ChAd63-based vaccines follow the same pattern, with 
findings consistent with a predicted response to vaccine administration (eg, observed changes 
in the intramuscular (IM) injection site and immune system response).
Relevance to human use: None. Note changes in IM injection site are discussed under ‘local 
tolerance’ below.
Reproductive/developmental toxicity
A non-clinical developmental and reproductive toxicity study was performed to evaluate the 
effects of AZD1222 on fertility and reproductive processes of female CD-1 mice during the 
embryo/foetal development phase, and postnatal outcomes during the littering phase. 
Immunogenicity assessments were also made in dams, foetuses, and pups. There were no 
vaccine-related unscheduled deaths throughout the study. Furthermore, there were no vaccine-
related effects on female reproduction, foetal or pup survival, foetal external, visceral, or 
skeletal findings, pup physical development, and no abnormal gross pathology findings in 
pups or dams. Antibody responses raised in dams were maintained throughout gestation and 
postnatal periods, and seroconversion in foetuses and pups indicate placental and lactational 
transfer of immunoglobulins. Together with clinical data from non-pregnant people, these

AstraZeneca
Version: 8
results supported the inclusion of pregnant and breastfeeding people in AZD1222 clinical 
studies (Stebbings et al 2021a).
In a non-clinical study, the biodistribution of AZD1222 was assessed in mice for 29 days 
following intramuscular injection. Results show that AZD1222 was safe and well tolerated, 
with a spread that was largely confined to administration sites and the proximal sciatic nerve, 
with low levels observed in sites that are involved in rapid clearance of particulates by the 
reticuloendothelial system. Accordingly, levels of AZD1222 decreased from Day 2 to Day 29, 
indicating clearance. There were no quantifiable levels of AZD1222 in the blood, brain, spinal 
cord, reproductive tissue, and mammary gland suggesting a lack of widespread or long-term 
distribution of AZD1222 vector DNA throughout the body following its administration 
(Stebbings et al 2021b).
Relevance to human use: Based on these findings no reproductive or developmental effects 
are anticipated with AZD1222; however as pregnant and breast-feeding participants were 
excluded from AZD1222 clinical studies, this is regarded as an area of missing information 
until such time further data can be obtained in the clinical setting.
Genotoxicity
Genotoxicity studies have not been performed with AZD1222. Consistent with WHO 
guidelines on the nonclinical evaluation of vaccines (WHO 2005), genotoxicity studies are 
normally not required for the final vaccine formulation and therefore have not been 
conducted.
Relevance to human use: Not applicable.
Carcinogenicity
Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with AZD1222. Consistent with WHO 
guidelines on the nonclinical evaluation of vaccines (WHO 2005), carcinogenicity studies are 
not required for vaccine antigens. AZD1222 is a replication deficient, non-integrating 
adenovirus vector so there is no risk of carcinogenicity.
Relevance to human use: Not applicable. To date, there have been no clinical reports of 
chromosomal vector integration following adenovirus vector-mediated gene transfer.
Safety pharmacology
Respiratory and cardiovascular
A single AZD1222 safety pharmacology study (Study 617078) has been performed to date, 
designed to investigate the potential effects of AZD1222 on respiratory parameters in 
conscious male mice for at least 4 hours following administration, in addition to assessment of 
arterial blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature for up to 24 hours post-dose. Single

Version: 8
IM dose levels of zero (control), and 2.59 × 1010 vp (AZD1222) were administered, with an 
interval of 3 days between the 2 treatment sessions.
There were no changes in arterial blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature or respiratory 
parameters considered to be AZD1222-related. The no observed effect level (NOEL) for 
cardiovascular and respiratory assessment was 2.59 × 1010 vp.
Relevance to human use: None.
Neurobehavioral assessment
An Irwin Screen was included in a GLP repeat-dose toxicity study with AZD1222 
(Study 513351). There were no effects on body temperature, pupil size, or Irwin Screen 
observations considered to be AZD1222-related. The NOEL for the Modified Irwin Screen 
phase was 3.7 × 1010 vp.
Relevance to human use: None.
Other toxicity-related information
Immunogenicity
A post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 challenge study in rhesus macaques was conducted to 
evaluate protection and the potential for vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease 
(VAERD) (Non-human Primate Efficacy and Immunogenicity - Study 1). A single 
administration of AZD1222 significantly reduced viral load in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 
and respiratory tract tissue of vaccinated animals as compared to vector controls. None of the 
vaccinated monkeys developed pulmonary pathology after challenge with SARS-CoV-2. All 
lungs were histologically normal, and no evidence of viral pneumonia or immune-enhanced 
inflammatory disease was observed.
Relevance to human use: None. No evidence of VAERD following SARS-CoV-2 challenge in 
vaccinated rhesus macaques was observed.
Local Tolerance
Local tolerance with AZD1222 has been assessed in a GLP repeat-dose toxicity study in mice 
(Study 513351), from which findings indicated no erythema or oedema at the injection sites 
after administration of AZD1222 on any dosing occasion. Non adverse, fully reversible, 
mixed and/or mononuclear cell inflammation was observed in the subcutaneous tissues and 
skeletal muscle of the administration sites and adjacent sciatic nerve of animals dosed with 
AZD1222, however findings were consistent with anticipated findings after IM injection of 
vaccines.
Local tolerance was also evaluated as part of a repeat dose GLP toxicology study in mice with 
the related ChAdOx1 MERS vaccine. Changes related to treatment with ChAdOx1 MERS

vaccine were seen in the tissues of the IM injection site, the right lumbar lymph node 
(draining lymph node) and the spleen of mice. The inflammatory cell infiltrate seen in the 
tissues of the IM injection sites (infiltrates of lymphocytic/mononuclear inflammatory cells) 
were caused by the IM injection of the vaccine with the increased germinal centre 
development of the right lumbar lymph node caused by immune stimulation of the lymphatic 
drainage from this area and were not considered adverse.
Relevance to human use: Changes in the IM injection site have been observed as part of local 
tolerance testing in repeat-dose mouse toxicology studies with similar replication-defective 
ChAd vaccines. Injection site reactions are common adverse effects of vaccine administration 
and were observed in patients receiving AZD1222 in the clinical development programme. 
Consequently, injection site reaction is considered to be an identified risk of AZD1222; 
however, as this risk is well characterised, and does not require any additional 
pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation activities, it is not considered important for inclusion 
in the list of safety concerns.
Vaccine-related quality considerations
There are no adjuvant, stabilisers or preservatives included in the AZD1222 formulation that 
are deemed to influence the safety profile of the final vaccine product.
Host cell proteins may remain as a contaminant as a result of the manufacturing process; 
however, levels are controlled by biological product deviation (BPD) release criteria and are 
therefore not of relevance.
Relevance to human use: None.

Table II-1 provides a breakdown of exposure for the US study (D8110C00001, which 
included participants from the US [88.7%], Chile [6.8%], and Peru [4.5%]), and for the pooled 
University of Oxford-sponsored studies (COV001 [UK], COV002 [UK], COV003 [Brazil], 
and COV005 [South Africa]).
All participants in the US study and most participants in the 4 pooled University of Oxford-
sponsored studies, were randomised to receive 2 standard doses of either AZD1222 (at 
5.0 × 1010 vp or equivalent) or control. Some participants in the pooled Oxford studies were 
randomised to single dose cohorts and for some who received 2 doses of AZD1222, one or 
both the doses were non-standard (ie, low doses of AZD12222 2.2 × 1010 vp or 2.5 × 1010 vp).
Further breakdowns of these exposure data from the US and pooled Oxford studies by age 
group and sex (Table II-2) and race (Table II-3) are also provided.

MODULE SIV: POPULATIONS NOT STUDIED IN CLINICAL 
TRIALS
Exclusion Criteria in pivotal clinical studies within the development 
programme
Important exclusion criteria in the US (D8110C00001) and University of Oxford-sponsored 
studies are described below:
Pregnant and breastfeeding women
Reason for exclusion: Women who were pregnant or breastfeeding were excluded from the 
clinical studies to avoid potential harm to the unborn foetus or breastfed infant.
Considered to be included as missing information: Yes
Patients with severe immunodeficiency
Reason for exclusion: Patients with severe immunodeficiency or requiring systemic 
immunosuppressive medication were excluded from the clinical studies. Patients with severe 
immunodeficiency were excluded in order to avoid factors that may confound a complete 
understanding of the safety and efficacy of AZD1222 and to ensure interpretability of data.
Considered to be included as missing information: Yes
Patients with severe and/or uncontrolled underlying disease
Reason for exclusion: Patients with severe and/or uncontrolled cardiovascular, respiratory, 
gastrointestinal, liver, renal, endocrine/metabolic disease, and neurological illness were 
excluded from the clinical studies in order to avoid factors that may confound a complete 
understanding of the safety and efficacy of AZD1222 and to ensure interpretability of data. 
Participants with mild/moderate well controlled comorbidities were allowed to participate in 
the clinical studies. 
Considered to be included as missing information: Yes (included in the area of missing 
information of ‘Use in frail patients with co-morbidities [eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD), diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders]’)
Paediatric and adolescent patients < 18 years of age
Reason for exclusion: This population was excluded from the majority of AZD1222 clinical 
studies based on the general principle that paediatric patients are not routinely exposed to an 
investigational product where the benefit-risk profile for the intended adult population has not 
yet been established, rather than due to a specific safety concern.
Considered to be included as missing information: No
27 of 97
European Union Risk Management Plan
ChAdOx1-S (recombinant) (AZD1222)
AstraZeneca
Version: 8
Rationale: Use of AZD1222 in children and adolescents < 18 years is not part of the proposed 
indication.
History of allergy to any component of the vaccine
Reason for exclusion: Patients with known allergy/hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or 
comparator were excluded from the clinical studies as these individuals may have a higher 
risk of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis. 
Considered to be included as missing information: No
Rationale: AZD1222 is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to active 
substance and excipients, therefore use in this patient population is not applicable for the 
approved indication.
Patients with bleeding disorder or prior history of significant bleeding or bruising 
following IM injections or venepuncture
Reason for exclusion: As AZD1222 is administered as an IM injection, patients with history 
of bleeding disorders were excluded from the clinical studies due to the potential for an 
increased risk of injection site haemorrhage or bruising.
Considered to be included as missing information: No
Rationale: Prevention and management of injection site bleeding and/or bruising after IM 
injection in patients with bleeding disorders or prior history of significant bleeding is fully 
integrated into standard immunisation practice. Use in this patient population does not require 
further characterisation and is therefore not considered as missing information. Precautions for 
individuals with thrombocytopenia and/or coagulation disorders are described in the Summary 
of Product Characteristics (SmPC) Section 4.4.
Planned receipt of any vaccine (licensed or investigational; other than AZD1222), 30 
days before and after each AZD1222 vaccination administration
Reasons for exclusion: Patients who had undergone previous vaccination within 30 days of the 
first dose of AZD1222 were excluded from clinical studies in order to avoid factors that may
confound a complete understanding of the safety and efficacy data of AZD1222 and ensure 
interpretability of data.
Considered to be included as missing information: Yes (included in the area of missing 
information of ‘Interactions with other vaccines’).

Version: 8
Patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) or any other demyelinating condition 
(only excluded from US study D8110C00001)
Reasons for exclusion: Patients with GBS or any other demyelinating condition were excluded 
from US study D8110C00001 as these individuals may have a higher risk of these 
demyelinating events.
Considered to be included as missing information: No
Rationale: Very rare events of demyelinating disorders have been reported following 
vaccination with AZD1222. SmPC includes GBS and transverse myelitis (TM). It is possible 
that this excluded population may be at a higher risk of these events than the general indicated 
population. Guillain-Barré syndrome is considered as an important identified risk.
II.4.2
Limitations to detect adverse reactions in clinical trial development 
programmes
The clinical development programme is unlikely to detect certain types of adverse reactions 
such as rare serious adverse events following immunisation (especially those with rates of 
occurrence of less than 1 per 100000 vaccinees), or adverse reactions with a long latency.

MODULE SV: POST-AUTHORISATION EXPERIENCE
II.5.1
Method used to calculate exposure
The post-marketing exposure data included in this section are presented by the number of 
doses distributed and the number of doses administered. All doses of VAXZEVRIA are 
intended for the same indication and route of administration.
For doses distributed, detailed vaccinee-level data (eg, gender, ethnicity, and age category) are 
not available.
II.5.2
Exposure
The Vaxzevria International Birth Date (IBD) is 29 December 2020; however, the first dose of 
vaccine administered in the post-marketing setting was on 04 January 2021 in the UK.
Cumulatively up to 30 June 2023, global post-marketing exposure (by doses distributed) to 
Vaxzevria was estimated to be 2.99 billion doses. Cumulative regional data are presented in

MODULE SVII: IDENTIFIED AND POTENTIAL RISKS
II.7.1
Identification of safety concerns in the initial RMP submission
All safety data available from the AZD1222 clinical development programme were evaluated 
in order to formulate the initial list of identified risks (adverse drug reactions [ADRs]), in 
addition to the important potential risks described within the initial approved version of this 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) (Version 1, Succession 5). Risks that were not included in the 
initial list of safety concerns (including supporting rationales) are presented in Section 
II.7.1.1, with safety concerns relevant for inclusion in the initial approved RMP and their
justifications presented in Section II.7.1.2.
Further to these sections, a list of adverse events of special interest (AESIs) for AZD1222 is 
presented in Section II.7.1.3. In addition, considerations specific to COVID-19 vaccine safety 
are discussed in Section II.7.1.4.
II.7.1.1
Risk not considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in
the RMP
The following topics were not considered relevant for inclusion in the list of safety concerns at 
the time of initial EU RMP approval:
 Known risks that do not impact the risk-benefit profile:


Local injections site reactions (including injection site tenderness, pain, warmth, erythema,
pruritus, bruising, and swelling): Injection-site reactions are commonly observed following
IM injections and have been reported in AZD1222 clinical studies as common or very
common ADRs, which were generally mild or moderate in severity and self-limiting.
Specific guidance on the administration of AZD1222 for HCPs is provided in the SmPC, and
this is fully aligned with standard clinical practice for the management of injection site
reactions following immunisation.
Lymphadenopathy, Decreased appetite, Headache, Dizziness, Somnolence, Nausea,
Vomiting, Diarrhoea, Hyperhidrosis, Pruritus, Rash, Myalgia, Arthralgia, Fatigue, Malaise,
Feverishness, Fever, and Chills: These risks are frequently reported class effects for vaccines,
all of which tend to be of low-grade severity and self-limiting. These risks are all considered
to be ADRs for AZD1222 and are listed in the AZD1222 SmPC. These risks are considered
non-serious and have limited clinical impact.
 Other reasons for considering risks not important:
 HLA sensitisation in transplant candidates and recipients: There is a theoretical concern
related to the potential presence of soluble HLA or cell fragments from the human embryonic
kidney (HEK) 293 cell line in AZD1222 leading to HLA sensitisation in transplant
candidates and recipients. However, analytical investigations showed no evidence for the
presence of HLA proteins in AZD1222 Process 4 Drug Substance and serum sample testing
from AZD1222 vaccinated-individuals showed no de-novo occurrence of anti-HLA
antibodies following vaccination.

II.7.1.2
Risks considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the
initial EU RMP
Important identified risks
There were no important identified risks for AZD1222 at the time of initial EU RMP 
approval.
Important potential risk
The following topics were classified as important potential risks for AZD1222 at the time of 
initial EU RMP approval:
 Nervous system disorders, including immune-mediated neurological conditions

Risk benefit impact: There is a theoretical concern that vaccination could be associated with
immune-mediated neurological conditions. Very rare events of demyelinating disorders were
reported in the AZD1222 clinical development programme; however, there is no evidence
suggesting a causal relationship between AZD1222 and demyelinating disorders. Severe
neurological conditions may result in persistent or significant disability or incapacity and
require early detection, careful monitoring, and timely medical intervention.
 Vaccine-associated enhanced disease (VAED), including vaccine-associated enhanced
respiratory disease (VAERD)

Risk benefit impact: There is a theoretical concern that vaccination against SARS CoV-2
may be associated with enhanced severity of COVID-19 episodes which would manifest as
VAED. Vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory (VAERD) refers to the predominantly
lower respiratory tract presentation of VAED. Although available data have not identified
VAED/VAERD as a concern for AZD1222, the risk of VAED/VAERD cannot be ruled out.
VAED/VAERD may be potentially serious or life-threatening, and require early detection,
careful monitoring, and timely medical intervention.
 Anaphylaxis

Risk benefit impact: Anaphylaxis is an acute serious allergic reaction with multi-organ-
system involvement that can present or rapidly progress to a severe life-threatening reaction
requiring immediate medical attention. Risk of anaphylaxis after all vaccines is estimated to
be 1.31 per million vaccine doses (McNeil et al 2018). The risk of anaphylaxis is
idiosyncratic in nature, and no serious or acute events of anaphylaxis were reported in
AZD1222 clinical trials. Nevertheless, anaphylaxis is a topic of particular relevance for
pandemic vaccines due to the large number of individuals who will undergo vaccination.
Missing Information
The following topics were classified as missing information for AZD1222 at the time of initial 
EU RMP approval:
 Use during pregnancy and while breastfeeding

Risk benefit impact: There is a limited amount of data from the use of AZD1222 in pregnant
and/or lactating women, or from women who became pregnant after receiving AZD1222.
While preliminary non-clinical safety studies have not indicated any concern to date, the
35 of 97
European Union Risk Management Plan
ChAdOx1-S (recombinant) (AZD1222)
AstraZeneca
Version: 8
effect of AZD1222 on the foetus and breastfed infant is unknown, as data are currently 
insufficient to inform on any vaccine-associated risk. As AZD1222 is intended for use in 
mass vaccination campaigns in a large proportion of the global population, the collection of 
pregnancy and infant outcomes data with the aim of characterising the safety profile in this 
population, is considered necessary.
 Use in immunocompromised patients

Risk benefit impact: Immunocompromised individuals are at greater risk of morbidity and
mortality from vaccine-preventable disease. In addition, vaccines may be less effective in
severely immunocompromised subjects, as the vaccinees weakened immune system may not
mount a sufficient response. Although there is no evidence that the safety profile of this
population receiving AZD1222 will be different to that of the general population, given the
paucity of data, the possibility cannot be excluded. As immunocompromised subjects have
been identified as a priority group for initial vaccination in several jurisdictions following
vaccine availability, proactive data collection in this population receiving AZD1222 is
important.
 Use in frail patients with co-morbidities (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders)

Risk benefit impact: This population is potentially at risk of developing a more severe
manifestation of COVID-19. Although there is no evidence that the safety profile of this
population receiving AZD1222 will be different to that of the general population, given the
paucity of data, the possibility cannot be excluded. As this population has been identified as a
priority group for initial vaccination in several jurisdictions following vaccine availability,
proactive data collection in this population receiving AZD1222 is important.
 Use in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders

Risk benefit impact: This population is potentially at risk of developing a more severe
manifestation of COVID-19. Although there is no evidence that the safety profile of this
population receiving AZD1222 will be different to that of the general population, given the
paucity of data, the possibility cannot be excluded. As this population has been identified as a
priority group for initial vaccination in several jurisdictions following vaccine availability,
proactive data collection in this population receiving AZD1222 is important.
Interactions with other vaccines

Risk benefit impact: The safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of AZD1222 when co-
administered with other vaccines (eg, with seasonal illness vaccines [such as the influenza
and pneumococcal vaccines]) has not been evaluated. Therefore, while there is currently no
evidence to suggest the safety profile of the subjects receiving AZD1222 when co-
administered with other vaccines would be impacted, given the paucity of data, the
possibility cannot be excluded.
Long-term safety

Risk benefit impact: Given the expedited nature of the AZD1222 clinical development
programme, understanding of the long-term safety profile of AZD1222 is currently limited.
While there is currently no evidence to suspect an adverse long-term safety profile, given the
paucity of data, the possibility cannot be excluded.

Adverse Events of Special Interest
II.7.1.3
Adverse events of special interest in the context of this RMP are defined as adverse events
that may be of interest in the context of a mass COVID-19 vaccine administration campaign,
which may represent potential signals requiring timely investigation or regulatory action, that
could lead to a change in the benefit-risk balance of AZD1222, or that could require prompt
communication to the public by regulatory or public health authorities.
The current list of AESIs applicable to AZD1222 is presented in Table II-9. This list is 
informed by global regulatory guidance, global vaccine safety research networks, and data 
obtained from the AZD1222 clinical development programme. The inclusion of these AESIs 
may be based on theoretical considerations and/or be based on past associations, whether 
causal or not, with different vaccines, or are conditions that are expected to occur naturally 
with COVID-19 in the absence of vaccination. This AESI list will be reviewed on an ongoing 
basis and will be updated as necessary. Consequently, should an update to the AESI list be 
required, any impact on the ongoing/planned post-authorisation safety studies (PASS) will be 
assessed at that time.
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) search term lists (at the Preferred 
Term [PT] level) used for AESIs are included in Annex 7.

Further Considerations for COVID-19 Vaccines
II.7.1.4
Further considerations for RMP Module SVII in specific relation to COVID-19 vaccine
development are also described in the EMA guidance document ‘Consideration on core
requirements for RMPs of COVID-19 vaccines’ (EMA/PRAC/709308/2022) (EMA 2022).
These considerations are therefore discussed below for completeness:
Reactogenicity
As of 31 December 2021, in the pooled Oxford studies, solicited local and systemic adverse 
events (AEs) were reported by 73.4 % and 72.8% of evaluated participants in the pooled Dose 
1 SD safety dataset (N = 10306), respectively, within the first 7 days following any dose of 
38 of 97
European Union Risk Management Plan
ChAdOx1-S (recombinant) (AZD1222)
AstraZeneca
Version: 8
AZD1222. In the control group (MenACWY vaccine active control or saline placebo; N = 
10141), solicited local and systemic AEs were reported by 48.9% and 60.8% of participants, 
respectively. The reduced reactogenicity in the control group of the overall pooled safety 
population is expected given that participants in this group could have received either the 
MenACWY active control or saline placebo compared to the AZD1222 group, in which all 
participants received active treatment.
Additionally, for the US study (D8110C00001), in the safety analysis set, 1956 participants in 
the AZD1222 group and 981 participants in the placebo group were evaluated for solicited 
AEs within 7 days after any vaccination. Solicited local and systemic AEs were reported by 
74.1% (1440 participants) and 71.6% of participants (1395 participants), respectively, within 
the first 7 days following any vaccination with AZD1222. In the placebo group, solicited local 
injection site and systemic AEs were reported by 24.4% (239 participants) and 53.0% of 
participants (519 participants), respectively.
With respect to the reactogenicity profile of AZD1222 by age group, solicited local and 
systemic AEs were milder and reported less frequently in older adults (≥ 65 years) compared 
to younger adults (18 to 64 years). Solicited AEs were milder and reported less frequently 
after the second dose than after the first dose in both age groups. Furthermore, no imbalances 
in the nature and severity of reactogenicity events was noted in participants with 
comorbidities.
The reactogenicity events associated with AZD1222 occurring in close temporal association to 
vaccination were generally mild to moderate in severity, of short duration, and generally did 
not require medical intervention, and were thereby of limited clinical impact. Further 
characterisation of solicited local and systemic reactogenicity events is therefore not 
warranted. 
Reactogenicity in AZD1222 as a Booster Dose
In study D7220C00001, the frequency of solicited local and systemic AEs in participants 
receiving a homologous booster of AZD1222 who were previously vaccinated with AZD1222 
(N=373) was 59.8% and 59.2%, respectively. The frequency of solicited local and systemic 
AEs in participants receiving a heterologous booster of AZD1222 who were previously 
vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine (N=322) was 75.5% and 78.9%, respectively, which is 
similar to the reactogenicity observed in participants receiving a first dose of AZD1222 in 
previous clinical studies. Across both groups who received a booster dose of AZD1222, most 
solicited AEs were mild or moderate in intensity and generally resolved within a few days.
In the COV001 study, the observed reactogenicity in participants who received a single 
homologous booster dose (third dose) following a 2-dose primary vaccination course of 
AZD1222 was consistent with the known reactogenicity profile of COVID-19 Vaccine

AstraZeneca and was lower after the third dose compared with after the first dose (Flaxman et 
al 2021).
In the published study RHH 001, a Phase 4 randomized single-blind study conducted in 
Brazil, 304 participants received a single booster dose (third dose) of AZD1222 following a 2-
dose primary vaccination course with an inactivated whole-virion SARS-CoV-2 vaccine 
(CoronaVac) (Clemens et al 2022). The reported reactogenicity profile was consistent with the 
known reactogenicity profile of AZD1222.
Overall, based on available data, the reactogenicity of either a homologous or heterologous 
booster dose of AZD1222, has been shown to be consistent with the reactogenicity profile of 
AZD1222 when administered as a primary vaccination course.
Formulation and preparation aspects of the vaccine
In animals and humans, ChAdOx1 reversion to virulence has not been detected. The 
biological material used in the manufacturing process are not known to be pathogenic to 
humans and are thus not known to have potential for infection in humans. Contaminations 
introduced by the manufacturing process do not have a potential for transmission of infectious 
agents.
AZD1222 does not form infectious particles in vaccinated individuals. Shedding from 
vaccinated individuals to unvaccinated close contacts does not occur, as the vaccine is injected 
via IM route. As AZD1222 is replication-deficient, it does not replicate in vaccinated 
individuals, so transmission does not occur.
Risk of vaccine drop out
Data pertaining to the reason for drop out (ie, discontinuation from treatment) following each 
dose of AZD1222 were not collected in pivotal studies. However, the overall study 
discontinuation rate in the pooled Oxford studies (any dose group; N = 12259) as of
31 December 2021 indicates that early discontinuation from the study for any reason was very 
low in the AZD1222 arm (n = 1621 participants [13.2%]). In the US study (D8110C00001), 
the incidence of study discontinuation was low; a total of < 0.1% (3 participants) in the 
AZD1222 group and < 0.1% (5 participants) in the placebo group discontinued the study due 
to AEs within 28 days following any vaccination. A total of 1.2% (266 participants) in the 
AZD1222 group and 1.5% (160 participants) in the placebo group discontinued study 
intervention due to AEs following any vaccination.
Relevance of the long-term follow-up
Given the expedited nature of the AZD1222 clinical development programme in response to 
the global COVID-19 pandemic, understanding of the long-term safety profile of AZD1222 is 
currently limited. Consequently, while there is no scientific evidence to suspect an adverse 
long-term safety profile based on long-term safety data from AZD1222 studies (1 year follow-

up from COV pooled analysis and 2-year follow-up from the US Study) and post-marketing 
experience with distribution of approximately 3 billion doses. However, it is recognised that 
further follow-up for all vaccines developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is 
required. This topic is therefore included as an area of missing information.
For AZD1222, long-term safety is being evaluated through the planned PASS activities (see 
Section III.2.1).
The ongoing PASS activities will follow participants for varying lengths of time to allow 
meaningful data collection for the evaluation of long-term safety and effectiveness (see 
Section III.2.1).
Risks of vaccination errors in a context of mass vaccination campaigns
As AZD1222 will be administered in large scale vaccination programmes, there is a potential 
to introduce the risk of vaccination errors. Vaccination errors may relate to administration, 
vaccination scheme, storage conditions, or errors associated with multi-dose vials. These 
potential vaccination errors are mitigated through a number of strategies:

SmPC Section 6.6 contains instructions on administration and storage conditions for
AZD1222. Instructions on vaccination scheme are provided in SmPC Section 4.2.
 HCP and the public guides have been prepared, which include specific sections on
AZD1222 administration and storage.
 Medical information call centres are available for the public and HCPs to respond to

questions about AZD1222.
Traceability and Vaccination reminder cards are provided by AstraZeneca, where
applicable (see Section III.1.6).
Furthermore, as other COVID-19 vaccines are also available, there is the potential for 
confusion or interchangeability with other COVID-19 vaccines. The above tools will facilitate 
the education of HCPs on the avoidance of this situation.
II.7.2
New safety concerns and reclassification with a submission of an 
updated RMP
Thrombosis, previously considered as an important potential risk, is removed from the list of 
safety concerns and venous thromboembolism (VTE) is included as important identified risk 
following an PRAC imposition in regulatory procedure 
EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010912/202212.
Thrombosis was included as an important potential risk in the EU RMP Version 3 (dated 
14 Oct 2021) via regulatory procedure EMA/PRAC/157045/2021 based on the request from 
EMA. Thrombosis includes both arterial and/or venous thrombosis. Arterial thrombosis, 
coronary artery disease (CAD) including Myocardial Infarction (MI) and Cerebrovascular

Version: 8
Accident (CVA) were reviewed as part of Post-Authorisation Measure LEG 103 and the 
cumulative review of arterial thrombosis, CAD including MI and CVA cases did not raise new 
safety concerns. However, few literature articles showed increased risk for venous 
thromboembolism in association with Vaxzevria. 
Thus, IPR of “Thrombosis” is reclassified and removed from the list of safety concern and 
replaced with “Venous thromboembolism (VTE) without thrombocytopenia” as an important 
identified risk.
II.7.3
Details of important identified risks, important potential risks and 
missing information
Presentation of important identified risks and important potential risks
Important Identified Risk: Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome
II.7.3.1
Potential mechanisms
The exact mechanism of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) following
immunisation with AZD1222 is unknown. Several hypothetical biologic mechanisms (eg,
vaccine induction of Platelet Factor 4 (PF4 autoantibodies) have been proposed to explain the
pathophysiology of thromboembolic events with thrombocytopenia following vaccination
(Greinacher et al 2021). Among them a study by Baker et al 2021, proposes an interaction
between the ChAdOx1 vaccine vector used in COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca and PF4;
however, it is unknown if the adenoviral ChAdOx1 interaction with PF4 is actually platelet
activating or thrombogenic (causal of blood clots). Greinacher et al 2021 suggested that
ChAdOx1 itself or proteins contained within the vaccine can bind to PF4 to form immune
complexes which may drive a B-cell response causing high-titer anti-PF4 antibodies resulting
in TTS. However, none of these hypotheses have been confirmed.
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence
There were no reports of thrombosis concurrent with thrombocytopenia in the AZD1222
clinical development programme. Very rare events of serious TTS (including fatal events), 
have been observed following vaccination with AZD1222 during post-authorisation use.
Characterisation of the risk
TTS, in some cases accompanied by bleeding, has been observed very rarely following 
vaccination with AZD1222. This includes severe cases presenting as venous thrombosis, 
including unusual sites such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, splanchnic vein thrombosis, 
as well as arterial thrombosis, concomitant with thrombocytopenia. The majority of these 
cases occurred within the first 21 days following vaccination and some events had a fatal 
outcome. The reporting rates after the second dose are lower compared to after the first dose.

European Union Risk Management Plan
ChAdOx1-S (recombinant) (AZD1222)
AstraZeneca
Version: 8
Risk factors and risk groups 
There are no known risk factors for the development of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia 
following vaccination.
Preventability
Prevention of TTS in the context of COVID-19 vaccination is currently unknown. As 
described in Section 4.4 of the SmPC, healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and 
symptoms of thromboembolism and/or thrombocytopenia. Vaccinated individuals should be 
instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms such as shortness of 
breath, chest pain, leg swelling, leg pain, persistent abdominal pain following vaccination.
Individuals diagnosed with thrombocytopenia/ thrombosis within three weeks after 
vaccination with AZD1222, should be actively investigated for signs of 
thrombosis/thrombocytopenia.
TTS requires specialised clinical management. Healthcare professionals should consult 
applicable guidance and/or consult specialists (eg, haematologists, specialists in coagulation) 
to diagnose and treat this condition.
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product
TTS is a potentially life-threatening event if not recognised or managed appropriately, may 
result in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. TTS requires immediate medical 
intervention.
Public health impact
The public health benefit of vaccination is considered to outweigh the very rare occurrence of 
these events.
II.7.3.2
Important Identified Risk: Thrombocytopenia, including immune
thrombocytopenia
Potential mechanism
The exact mechanism of thrombocytopenia, including immune thrombocytopenia following 
immunisation with AZD1222 is unknown.
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence
Very rare cases of thrombocytopenia, including immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), have been 
observed following vaccination with AZD1222 during post-authorisation use.
Characterisation of the risk
Cases of thrombocytopenia, including immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), have been reported 
after receiving Vaxzevria, typically within the first four weeks after vaccination. Very rarely, 
these presented with very low platelet levels (< 20,000 per µL) and/or were associated with

European Union Risk Management Plan
ChAdOx1-S (recombinant) (AZD1222)

Version: 8
bleeding. Some of these cases occurred in individuals with a history of immune 
thrombocytopenia. Cases with fatal outcome have been reported. In the clinical development 
programme, in the primary analysis of the study D8110C00001(DCO 05 March 2021),
thrombocytopenia was reported in 2 participants (< 0.1%) in the AZD1222 group and immune 
thrombocytopenia was reported in 1 participant each (< 0.1%) in both AZD1222 group and 
the placebo group. In the long-term safety analysis at 6-months data cut-off (30 July 2021) 
when censored at the time of EUA vaccination, one additional event of thrombocytopenia was 
reported in a participant in the AZD 1222 group. None of these events were serious and none 
of these participants in either of the treatment groups reported concurrent thromboembolic 
event.
Risk factors and risk groups
There are no known risk factors for the development of thrombocytopenia following 
vaccination. In general, individuals with a history of thrombocytopenic disorder, such as 
immune thrombocytopenia, the risk of developing low platelet levels should be considered 
before administering the vaccine and platelet monitoring is recommended after vaccination as 
described in Section 4.4 of the SmPC.
Preventability
Prevention of thrombocytopenia including immune thrombocytopenia in the context of 
COVID-19 vaccination is currently unknown. Individuals diagnosed with thrombosis within 
three weeks after vaccination with Vaxzevria, should be actively investigated for signs of 
thrombocytopenia as described in Section 4.4 of the SmPC.
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product
Thrombocytopenia including immune thrombocytopenia if not recognised or managed 
appropriately can lead to bleeding which can be a potentially life-threatening event. 
Thrombocytopenia with associated bleeding requires immediate medical intervention.
Public health impact
The public health benefit of vaccination is considered to outweigh the very rare occurrence of 
these events.
Important Identified Risk: Guillain-Barré syndrome
II.7.3.3
Potential mechanism
Exact mechanism of GBS following immunization with AZD1222 is unknown. Although the
underlying etiology and pathophysiology of GBS are not completely understood, it is believed
that immune stimulation plays a central role in its pathogenesis (Sejvar et al 2011).
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence
In the US study (D8110C00001), 1 SAE of a demyelinating event initially reported as 
Guillain-Barre syndrome occurred in a participant enrolled in the AZD1222 group. The SAE 
44 of 97

Version: 8
of GBS was subsequently amended to an SAE of Chronic inflammatory demyelinating 
polyradiculoneuropathy. Very rare events of GBS have been observed following vaccination 
with AZD1222 during post-authorisation use.
Characterisation of the risk
Very rare events of GBS have been observed following vaccination with AZD1222 in the 
post-authorisation setting. These reports of GBS have been associated temporally after 
vaccination and resulted in fatal outcome in isolated cases. The majority of the GBS cases 
were reported in vaccinees < 69 years of age. Pharmacoepidemiologic studies suggest an 
increased rate of GBS after the 1st dose of AZD1222 in the first 4-6 weeks after vaccination 
(Keh et al 2021 and Maramattom et al 2021).
Risk factors and risk groups
There are no known risk factors for the development of GBS following vaccination. In 
general, infection with the bacteria Campylobacter jejuni is one of the most common risk 
factors for GBS. People also can develop GBS after having the flu or other infections such as 
cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus. On very rare occasions, people develop GBS in the 
days or weeks after getting a vaccination (CDC 2019).
Preventability
As described in SmPC section 4.4, the healthcare professionals should be alert of GBS signs 
and symptoms to ensure correct diagnosis, in order to initiate adequate supportive care and 
treatment, and to rule out other causes.
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product
GBS, though rare, is the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis and if not recognised 
or managed appropriately, may result in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, and 
hence requires immediate medical intervention.
Public health impact
Occurrence of GBS following AZD1222 vaccine is very rare and as such the public health 
benefit of vaccination is considered to outweigh the very rare potential occurrences of such 
events.
Important Identified Risk: Venous thromboembolism
II.7.3.4
Potential mechanisms
The exact mechanism of Venous thromboembolism (VTE) following immunisation with
Vaxzevria is unknown. In general, the pathophysiology VTE includes a blood flow stasis,
hypercoagulability, endothelial dysfunction and injury. Severe coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) is associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolism events.
45 of 97
European Union Risk Management Plan
ChAdOx1-S (recombinant) (AZD1222)
AstraZeneca
Version: 8
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence 
VTE has been observed rarely following vaccination with Vaxzevria in clinical trials, 
however, there was no increase in VTE events among individuals who received AZD1222 
compared to placebo/comparator. In the post marketing setting very rare events of VTE 
(DVT/PE) without thrombocytopenia have been observed; few literature articles showed 
increased risk for venous thromboembolism in association with Vaxzevria. VTE is an adverse 
drug reaction described in the SmPC. 
Characterisation of the risk
Serious events of venous thrombosis without thrombocytopenia have been reported following 
vaccination with AZD1222 during post-authorisation use. Majority of the case reports 
occurred within the first 28 days following vaccination and some events had a fatal outcome
(White 2003). 
However, large population studies (Burn Li et al 2022, Whiteley et al 2022, Hippisley-Cox et 
al 2021, Andrews et al 2022, Ab Rahman et al 2022, Li et al 2022) showed increased risk for 
venous thromboembolism and PE in younger age-group (<60 years) in association with 
Vaxzevria.
Risk factors and risk groups
There are no known risk factors identified for the development of VTE following vaccination.
Preventability
The SmPC Section 4.4 provides guidance to healthcare professionals to be alert to signs and 
symptoms of thromboembolism and advises to take the occurrence of VTE into consideration 
for individuals at increased risk for VTE.
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product
VTE is a potentially life-threatening event, and if not recognised or managed appropriately, 
may result in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, and hence requires immediate 
medical intervention.
Public health impact
The public health benefits of vaccination is considered to outweigh the very rare occurrence of 
these events.
Important Potential Risk: Immune-mediated neurological conditions
II.7.3.5
Potential mechanisms
Several hypothetical biologic mechanisms have been proposed to explain the pathophysiology
of neurologic adverse reactions following immunisation; most involve the concept of
autoimmunity and the possibility that the immunostimulatory effect of the vaccine results in
an aberrant immunologic response (Stratton et al 1994).
46 of 97
European Union Risk Management Plan
ChAdOx1-S (recombinant) (AZD1222)
AstraZeneca
Version: 8
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence 
The association between vaccines and acute demyelinating events has been assessed in a range 
of studies and expert reviews, including a population-based analysis of nearly 64 million 
vaccine doses in the US, which concluded that if there is an association between transverse 
myelitis and vaccines, it is < 2 per million doses of live-zoster and live-attenuated influenza 
vaccines, and < 1 per million doses for other vaccines (Baxter et al 2016). Moreover, 
demyelinating diseases occur more frequently with infections than with vaccination 
(Miravalle et al 2010). Taken together, the evidence is inconclusive regarding a causal relation 
between contemporary vaccines and acute demyelinating events (Principi and Esposito 2020, 
Mouchet et al 2018, Phillips et al 2018).
Very rare events of immune-mediated neurological conditions have been observed following 
vaccination with AZD1222 during post-authorisation use.
Characterisation of the risk
A review of the events in the pooled safety dataset in the MedDRA System Organ Class 
(SOC) of Nervous System Disorders in AZD1222-treated participants (any dose group) 
demonstrated that reactogenicity events (ADRs) comprised the majority of events in this SOC. 
No imbalance (between the AZD1222 group and the control group) in the incidence of events 
in the Nervous System Disorders SOC was noted when reactogenicity ADRs were removed.
Overall, in clinical studies there were no clinically meaningful imbalances in the incidence of 
neurological AESIs. In the pooled Oxford studies as of 31 December 2021, neurologic or 
neuroinflammatory AESIs were reported in 1.0% (121/12,259 participants) in the AZD1222 
group and 1.0% (117/11,962 participants) in the control group. In the primary analysis of the 
US study (DCO 05 March 2021), neurologic or neuroinflammatory AESIs were reported in 
0.6 % (121/21,587 participants) in the AZD1222 group 0.4 % (48/10,792 participants) in the 
placebo group. In the long-term safety analysis at 6-months data cut-off (30 July 2021) when 
censored at the time of EUA vaccination, neurologic or neuroinflammatory AESIs were 
reported in 0.6% of participants (137 participants) in the AZD1222 group (exposure adjusted 
rate of 0.01/patient-year) and 0.5% of participants (51 participants) in the placebo group 
(0.01/patient-year).
Furthermore, in the pooled Oxford studies no clinically meaningful imbalance was noted in 
the incidence of AESIs of neuroinflammatory disorders, which were reported in 10 
participants (0.1%) in the AZD1222 group and 6 participants (< 0.1%) in the control group in 
the pooled safety dataset (any dose group). Of these, the most frequently reported events were 
nonserious AEs of facial paralysis, occurring in 4 participants in the AZD1222 group and 3 
participants in the control group. In the primary analysis of the US study (DCO 
05 March 2021), there were 5 participants reported nonserious AEs of facial paralysis, all in 
the AZD1222 group. In the long-term safety analysis at 6-months data cut-off (30 July 2021) 
47 of 97
European Union Risk Management Plan

AstraZeneca
Version: 8
when censored at the time of EUA vaccination, 3 additional participants reported nonserious 
AEs of facial paralysis in the AZD 1222 group.
In the pooled Oxford studies, there were 4 SAEs of demyelinating events: 3 cases in the 
AZD1222 group (1 case of transverse myelitis, and 2 case of multiple sclerosis in a participant 
with pre-existing, but previously unrecognised, multiple sclerosis), and 1 case of myelitis in 
the control group. In the primary analysis of the US study (DCO 05 March 2021), there was 1 
SAE of a demyelinating event: a participant in the AZD1222 group had an AE initially 
reported as Guillain-Barre syndrome, which was subsequently diagnosed as an SAE of 
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. In the long-term safety analysis 
at 6-months data cut-off (30 July 2021) when censored at the time of EUA vaccination, one 
additional SAE was reported in a participant who experienced demyelinating polyneuropathy.
Risk factors and risk groups
There are no known risk factors for the development of immune-mediated neurological 
conditions, following vaccination.
Preventability
Prevention of immune-mediated neurological conditions, in the context of SARS-CoV-2 
vaccination is unknown.
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product
Severe neurological conditions, if not recognised or managed appropriately, may result in 
persistent or significant disability or incapacity.
Public health impact
Severe neurological disorders are very rare, and as such the public health benefit of 
vaccination is considered to outweigh the very rare potential occurrences of such events.
II.7.3.6
Important Potential Risk: Vaccine-associated enhanced disease (VAED),
including vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD)
Potential mechanisms
The pathogenesis of VAED in the context of SARS-CoV-2 is unclear, and there are no 
consistent mechanisms or immune markers of disease enhancement from nonclinical studies 
(Haynes et al 2020). VAERD refers to the predominantly lower respiratory tract presentation 
of VAED. The mechanism of the pathogenesis of VAERD may be specific to the lower 
respiratory tract or may be part of a systemic process.
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence
There is a theoretical concern that vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 may be associated with 
enhanced severity of COVID-19 episodes which would manifest as VAED/VAERD. Vaccine-
associated enhanced disease was observed in children given formalin-inactivated whole-virus 
48 of 97
European Union Risk Management Plan
ChAdOx1-S (recombinant) (AZD1222)
AstraZeneca
Version: 8
vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus and measles virus (Haynes et al 2020), and 
findings from experimental models of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection suggest that 
VAED/VAERD may be possible in certain conditions (EMA 2021b, EMA 2021c, FDA 2020).
Characterisation of the risk
In the AZD1222 clinical programme, there was no evidence of an association between 
AZD1222 and VAED/VAERD; proportionally more AESIs based on study specific lists of 
terms related to COVID-191 occurred in the control group than among AZD1222 recipients. 
In the pooled Oxford studies as of 31 December 2021, COVID-related AESIs were reported in
0.5% (66/12,259 participants) in the AZD1222 group and 1.0% (118/11,962 participants) in 
the control group. There have been no confirmed post-marketing reports of VAED/VAERD.
In the primary analysis of the US study (DCO 05 March 2021), COVID-related AESIs were 
reported in 1.7% (374/21,587 participants) in the AZD1222 group and 3.4% (362/10,792 
participants) in the placebo group. In the long-term safety analysis at 6-months data cut-off
(30 July2021) when censored at the time of EUA vaccination, COVID-related AESIs were 
reported in 3.2% of participants (697 participants) in the AZD1222 group (exposure adjusted
rate of 0.06/patient-year) and 4.3% of participants (461 participants) in the placebo group 
(0.13/patient-year).
Risk factors and risk groups
There are no known risk factors identified for VAED/VAERD.
Preventability
Prevention of VAED/VAERD in the context of SARS-CoV-2 is currently unknown.
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product
Vaccine-associated enhanced disease (including VAERD) may present as severe disease or 
modified/unusual clinical manifestations of a known disease presentation and may involve one 
or multiple organ systems. Subjects with VAED/VAERD may experience rapid clinical 
deterioration and will likely require non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, and 
patients diagnosed with ARDS have poorer prognosis and potentially higher mortality rate.
Public health impact
As this safety concern is currently theoretical in relation to AZD1222 administration, there is 
no public health impact noted at this time.

II.7.3.7 Missing Information: Use during pregnancy and while breastfeeding
Evidence source
Data from more than 400 case reports of pregnant women or women who became pregnant
after receiving AZD1222 do not suggest unusual patterns of pregnancy complications or
foetal/neonatal outcomes. No increased risk of maternal thrombosis in combination with
thrombocytopenia has been observed. Preliminary non-clinical safety studies have not
indicated any concern to date and available non-clinical, clinical and post-marketing data do
not suggest a risk to breastfed new borns /infants.
As AZD1222 is intended for use in mass vaccination campaigns in a large proportion of the 
global population, the collection of pregnancy and infant outcomes data with the aim of 
further characterising the safety profile in this population, is considered necessary.
Population in need of further characterisation
Use of AZD1222 in pregnant and breastfeeding women is investigated in the ongoing PASS 
activities (a post-marketing observational study using existing secondary health data sources, 
and a pregnancy registry; see Section III.2.1 for further details).
II.7.3.8 Missing Information: Use in immunocompromised patients
Evidence source
Vaccines may be less effective in severely immunocompromised subjects, as the vaccinees
weakened immune system may not mount a sufficient response; however,
immunocompromised individuals may also be at greater risk of morbidity and mortality from
vaccine-preventable disease, and consequently this population have been identified as a
priority group for initial vaccination in several jurisdictions following vaccine availability.
Although there is no evidence that the safety profile of this population receiving AZD1222
will be different to that of the general population, given the paucity of data, the possibility
cannot be excluded.
Population in need of further characterisation
Use in immunocompromised patients will be investigated in the planned and ongoing PASS 
activities (post-marketing observational study using existing secondary health data sources, 
see Section III.2.1 for further details).
II.7.3.9 Missing Information: Use in frail patients with co-morbidities (eg, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, chronic neurological disease, 
cardiovascular disorders)
Evidence source

Although there is no evidence that the safety profile of this population receiving AZD1222 
will be different to that of the general population, given the paucity of data, the possibility 
cannot be excluded.
Population in need of further characterisation
Use in frail patients with co-morbidities (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, 
chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) is investigated in the ongoing PASS 
activity (a post-marketing observational study using existing secondary health data sources; 
see Section III.2.1 for further details).
II.7.3.10 Missing Information: Use in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory
disorders
Evidence source
Subjects with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders are potentially at risk of developing a 
more severe manifestation of COVID-19, and as a consequence have been included as a 
priority group for initial vaccination in several jurisdictions following vaccine availability. 
There is no evidence from AZD1222 clinical studies to date that the safety profile of this 
population differs from that of the general population. However, given the paucity of data, the 
possibility cannot be excluded.
Population in need of further characterisation
Use in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders is investigated in the ongoing
PASS activity (a post-marketing observational study using existing secondary health data 
sources; see Section III.2.1 for further details).
II.7.3.11 Missing Information: Interactions with other vaccines
Evidence source
There is currently limited information regarding the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of
AZD1222 when co-administered with other vaccines concurrently seasonal illness vaccines.
While there is currently no evidence to suggest the safety profile or efficacy of AZD1222
when co-administered with other vaccines would be impacted, given the paucity of data, the
possibility of an interaction causing an altered safety profile or reduced efficacy of either
AZD1222 or the co-administered vaccine cannot be excluded.
Population in need of further characterisation
The co-administration of AZD1222 with other vaccines (either together, or 30 days before or 
after administration) is investigated in the ongoing PASS activity (a post-marketing 
observational study using existing secondary health data sources; see Section III.2.1 for 
further details). Vaccines to be evaluated include the influenza and pneumococcal vaccines.

II.7.3.12 Missing Information: Long-term safety
Evidence source
Given the expedited nature of the AZD1222 clinical development programme, understanding
of the long-term safety profile of AZD1222 is currently limited. However, there are no known
risks with a potentially delayed onset, with the exception of the theoretical concern of
VAED/VAERD. While there is currently no evidence to suspect an adverse long-term safety
profile, given the paucity of data, the possibility cannot be excluded.
Population in need of further characterisation
Long-term safety will be evaluated through the ongoing PASS activity (a post-marketing 
observational study using existing secondary health data sources; see Section III.2.1 for 
further details).
For the US study, long-term safety of AZD1222 has been evaluated through the 6-month data 
cut-off (31 July 2021). Relevant safety results through the 6-month data cut-off are presented 
for the Important identified risks and Important potential risks in section II.7.3. Overall, safety 
results at the final data cut-off (10 February 2023) were generally consistent with safety 
findings at the primary analysis, with no new or emerging safety issues identified.

PART III: PHARMACOVIGILANCE PLAN
III.1
ROUTINE PHARMACOVIGILANCE ACTIVITIES
AstraZeneca undertakes routine pharmacovigilance activities consistent with the International 
Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E2E Pharmacovigilance Planning Guideline.
Routine pharmacovigilance activities (as defined by standard operating procedures and 
guidelines) are designed to rapidly assess the ongoing safety profile of AZD1222 throughout 
clinical development and in the post-authorisation period in order to characterise and 
communicate pertinent safety data appropriately. A comprehensive description of all aspects 
of the pharmacovigilance system is provided in the Pharmacovigilance System Master File, 
which is available upon request.
In addition to ICH requirements, AstraZeneca’s routine pharmacovigilance activities in 
relation to AZD1222 are also aligned with the measures described in GVP PI, GVP IX for 
vaccine surveillance, and recent regulatory guidance specific to vaccine risk management in 
the context of the COVID-19 pandemic (EMA 2022, MHRA 2020). Routine surveillance 
activities to specifically address the challenges in the context of the pandemic are described in 
the sections below.
III.1.1
Signal Detection
Given the specific requirements of vaccines and the need to rapidly identify potential safety 
issues during the pandemic, routine signal detection activities are supplemented as described 
below.
Data sources that are used for signal detection and the frequency of their review are listed in 
Table III-1.

Version: 8
Due to the unique nature in which safety data are obtained for AZD1222 (both in methods of 
data collection and in volume of data), multiple methods for the evaluation of data retrieved 
from the above data sources are utilised for signal detection. These data sources are 
interrogated via a number of internal systems using a combination of quantitative and 
qualitative methodology. Further detail on both methodologies is provided below.
Quantitative methodology
Disproportionality analysis using a targeted database: Due to the limited volume of vaccine 
cases within AstraZeneca’s safety database, an external database (the US Vaccine Adverse 
Event Reporting System [VAERS]) was chosen for application of disproportionality analysis 
due to its large and varied vaccine profile. Two proportionality reporting ratio scores from this 
analysis are produced: a hybrid ratio score, and a standard proportionality score. The 
difference between these scores is described below:
 Disproportionality analysis score using a Hybrid Proportional Reporting Ratio (hPRR) –
AZD1222 safety data in AstraZeneca’s safety database compared to all VAERS data.
 Disproportionality analysis score (Proportional Reporting Ratio [PRR]) using VAERS
data alone - comparison of AZD1222 vaccine reports in VAERS to all VAERS data.
A ratio score of ≥ 1.8 is applied for events that require evaluation for both methods. A filter of 
3 case minimum is applied and a Yates corrected chi-square ≥ 4 is also applied for both hPRR 
and PRR.
Disproportionality analysis using EudraVigilance: EudraVigilance data are downloaded and 
integrated into the AstraZeneca Global Safety Database on a daily basis. These data are 
included in the quarterly data review. Additionally, an eRMR is generated on a monthly basis 
and is included as a part of surveillance review. The eRMR report is generated using the 
Active Substance High Level value of ‘COVID-19 VACCINE ASTRAZENECA (CHADOX1 
NCOV-19)’. A series of filters are applied to the eRMR to identify events requiring review. 
Examples of these filters include events that are statistically significant (RoR > 1.0), or are 
Important Medical Events, Designated Medical Events (DME) per the EMA, or have an 
increase in the number of reported cases.
Qualitative methodology
Routine safety data review: Data from AstraZeneca’s safety database are extracted in the form 
of specific reports covering the following categories of safety data (in which AZD1222 is 
captured as a suspect medication):
 All AEs; stratified by country, seriousness, and age group


 All AEs on AstraZeneca’s DME list
Fatal AEs
Serious Unlisted AEs
54 of 97
European Union Risk Management Plan
ChAdOx1-S (recombinant) (AZD1222)
AstraZeneca
Version: 8
 AESIs (including important potential risks) (see Section II.7.1 for further details of
AESIs)
 Disease specific Standardised MedDRA Queries (SMQs)


Pregnancy reports
Special Situations (example: reports of medication error, overdose, lack of efficacy, and
potential interactions with other vaccines administered concomitantly)
These reports are produced and reviewed monthly as part of routine surveillance activities. In 
addition, daily reports may be produced for cases not yet closed on the safety database to 
allow for early identification of any potential safety issue. Reports provide both in-period and 
cumulative event counts, and comparisons with previous event counts are conducted to 
determine if there are any sudden increases or unusual patterns of AE reporting, as population-
level exposure to AZD1222 increases over time. Furthermore, these reports facilitate the 
identification of potential serious but rare adverse reactions that may be associated with 
AZD1222 use.
Batch-related adverse reactions: On a monthly basis, a report of AEs by batch number is 
generated and analysed against batch distribution data using an observed vs expected analysis
model to identify batches with a higher number of AEs than expected being reported based on 
the volume distributed for that lot. Batches meeting the threshold for analysis are examined in 
further detail in order to identify any safety issues potentially related to the quality of 
AZD1222.
Time-series analysis: To aid in the identification of changes in case reporting over time, time-
series analyses will be considered based on necessity, and subject to the availability of 
baseline data.
Observed versus expected (O/E) analysis: O/E analysis is conducted for events/medical 
concepts provided on the AESI list (see Section II.7.1). The stratified background rates 
publicly available from the ACCESS program and other industry groups collaborating with 
Vaccines Europe are analysed against the observed reports received in AstraZeneca’s safety 
database, using distribution data and/or exposure data collected from EU member countries 
when made publicly available, on a 6 - monthly basis. However, to account for potential under 
reporting of AEs, sensitivity analysis is performed. Where appropriate, standard statistical 
testing methodology are also applied. To further enhance background rate identification 
additional literature review may be conducted if ACCESS data is insufficient or unavailable.
Time-to-onset analysis: An additional signal detection methodology currently under 
evaluation is time-to-onset analysis. This methodology will consider the amount of lapsed 
time from vaccine administration to event onset for a given event compared to onset time for 
all other vaccines for that event.

Cluster Analysis: Cluster analyses will be performed on an ad hoc basis (where justified), 
based on the results of routine surveillance methods described above. Should a cluster analysis 
be performed as part of the signal detection process, this will be included in the Periodic 
Safety Update Report (see Section III.1.4). Justifications will be described for such analyses, 
and all PTs will be provided.
Signal Evaluation
III.1.1.1
Any potential signal identified through the signal detection processes described in Section
III.1.1 will be thoroughly evaluated (utilising all sources of data available) to validate the
signal. This will include expanded analysis of all external regulatory database information
(EudraVigilance, VigiBase, VAERS), SAPPHIRE case data, literature publications, data from
clinical studies, epidemiology data, and O/E analysis of the event(s) of interest. All validated
signals will be presented in the PSUR (see Section III.1.4).
Following validation of any signal, a further internal safety review will be performed based on 
AstraZeneca’s standard operating procedures. Following this, should there be a reasonable 
possibility of a causal relationship with AZD1222, appropriate updates will be made to the 
core product information, which will subsequently be shared with Competent Authorities 
through standard regulatory processes.
III.1.2
ICSR Reporting
All ICSRs received for AZD1222 are processed and reported in accordance with the 
requirements specified in the EMA guidance document entitled ‘Detailed Guidance on ICSRs 
in the context of COVID-19 - Validity and coding of ICSRs (EMA/174312/2020)’ (EMA 
2020c). Spontaneous cases of Confirmed Vaccination Failure 2 when AZD1222 is used in 
accordance with its authorisation, will be reported within the required 15 days of receipt.
For all AZD1222 ICSRs received, data regarding the subject, the reporter, the adverse 
reaction, suspect drug(s) and product batch number are proactively sought.
Additionally, for all AZD1222 ICSRs received other than non-serious listed ICSRs, further 
data including, but not limited to, the subject’s medical history, concomitant medications, 
vaccination and reaction dates, and outcome are actively followed up.
2 Proposed definition for Confirmed Vaccination Failure with AZD1222: The occurrence of COVID-19 caused 
by SARS-CoV-2 in a person who is appropriately and fully vaccinated following an incubation period of 
≥ 15 days following the second dose of the vaccine. 
A COVID-19 diagnosis is defined as: Virologically-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (eg, RT-PCR) and at least 
1 symptom of COVID-19 disease (eg, objective fever [defined as ≥ 37.8 °C], cough, shortness of breath, 
anosmia, or ageusia) or COVID-19 diagnosis stated/provided by the Physician.

Furthermore, in case of a suspected quality defect, detailed specific information regarding 
batch release specifications, expiry date(s), and distribution and administration-related data 
(eg, storage and handling conditions for vaccines in the healthcare institutions where 
vaccination took place) will also be requested.
III.1.3
Specific Adverse Reaction Follow-Up Questionnaires
Targeted follow-up questionnaires are in place for important potential risks and AESIs.
Applicable targeted follow-up questionnaires for important identified and important potential 
risks are provided in Annex 4.
III.1.4
Summary Safety Reports
PSURs will serve as the tool for discussion of any safety topics as well as other standard
pharmacovigilance activities. The requirements for submission of PSURs for this medicinal
product are set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article
107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European
medicines web-portal.
III.1.5
Enhanced Passive Surveillance
Enhanced passive surveillance activities are not planned as other additional 
pharmacovigilance measures are in place (see Section III.2.1).
III.1.6
Traceability
In order to facilitate traceability of batch numbers for pharmacovigilance signal detection and 
reporting purposes, stickers detailing relevant brand name and batch numbers are placed into 
all cartons of drug product at the Contract Manufacturing Organizations (CMO) packing sites. 
Two stickers are provided per dose; hence, 200 stickers are included in each carton (which has 
100 doses based on 0.5 ml per dose), thereby providing stickers for both HCP and patient 
records. The vaccine carton labelling also includes a scannable 2D barcode that provides batch 
number and expiry date.
The stickers include the vaccine name (ie, ‘COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca’ or ‘Vaxzevria’), 
the relevant batch number, and a 2D barcode. As AstraZeneca is using several CMOs for 
packing purposes, all with unique carton dimensions and size, stickers may vary in size; 
however, the number of stickers per dose (ie, 2) remains the same. Traceability instructions 
for HCPs are provided in the SmPC.
Where regional practices permit, the batch number for Vaxzevria, if not already provided, is 
systematically followed up for each post marketing ICSR. When available, batch information 
is included in the AstraZeneca global safety database.

AstraZeneca also makes available Traceability and Vaccination reminder cards for vaccinators 
to facilitate batch number traceability. These cards are designed to be completed at the time of 
vaccination and be given to the vaccinee. These cards may be used by Member States where 
alternative strategies (ie, the use of electronic records or national mandated vaccination cards) 
are unavailable. The Traceability and Vaccination reminder cards contain the following 
elements:
Placeholder space for name of vaccinee

 Vaccine brand name and manufacturer name

Placeholder space for due date and actual date of first and second doses, and space for
batch/lot number
 A reminder to retain the card and to bring it to the appointment for the second dose of the
vaccine; in addition to a reminder to save the card after the second dose
 QR code that links to a Marketing Authorisation Holder website with additional
information on product use
Placeholder for AE reporting information (national contact points)

At the time of initial vaccine availability, AstraZeneca will provide sufficient quantities of 
blank Traceability and Vaccination cards to vaccinators in Member States where alternative 
strategies are unavailable. These cards are also available on AstraZeneca websites, where 
required by National Competent Authorities.
III.2
ADDITIONAL PHARMACOVIGILANCE ACTIVITIES
In order to obtain data to aid the further characterisation of the safety concerns described in 
Section II.7.3, a number of PASS activities are planned, which are presented in Section III.2.1. 
It is noted that in order to meet regulatory requirements, some of the planned PASS activities 
may be conducted under more than one localised protocol.

Post-marketing observational study using existing secondary health data sources
Study name and 
title:
A post-authorisation/post-marketing observational study to evaluate the association 
between exposure to AZD1222 and safety concerns using existing secondary health data 
sources and D8111R00006 [EU/UK]).
Rationale and 
study 
objectives:
The purpose of this study is to further define the incidence and relative risk of safety 
concerns and AESIs among adults vaccinated with AZD1222 and 3 different comparator 
cohorts: concurrent individuals who have not received any vaccination for COVID-19, 
active comparators (2 dose vaccinees only), and historical comparators – overall and in 
subpopulations of interest. The AZD1222 cohort will be matched, as applicable, 
independently to the 3 different comparator cohorts on calendar date of vaccination, age, 
sex, region, prior COVID 19, and status according to each of the five special populations. 
Matching will be done with replacement in a ratio of 1 vaccinated to 1 comparator subject. 
Where appropriate, the study will also use a self-controlled risk interval (SCRI) design.
The primary study objectives are as follows:
1. To describe the baseline characteristics of all subjects in the matched population.
2. To describe, among subjects who receive a first dose of AZD1222(i.e., in the all
AZD1222 vaccinated first dose population), the timing and type of second dose of
any COVID-19 vaccine (AZD1222 or other) over the study period.
3. To describe the incidence rates (IRs) of prespecified AESIs in subjects who
received at least 1 dose of AZD1222 in the matched population and subjects who
59 of 97
European Union Risk Management Plan
ChAdOx1-S (recombinant) (AZD1222)
AstraZeneca
Version: 8
did not receive any vaccination against COVID-19 (concurrent unvaccinated 
comparators) in the matched population.
4. To estimate the relative and absolute risk of prespecified AESIs in subjects who
received at least 1 dose of AZD1222 compared with concurrent unvaccinated
comparators in the matched populations, using a retrospective cohort design and
an SCRI design.
The secondary study objectives are as follows:
1. To describe the baseline characteristics of all subjects in the matched population
among the specific populations considered to have missing information.
2. To describe, among subjects who receive a first dose of AZD1222, (i.e., in the all
AZD1222 vaccinated first dose population), the timing and type of second dose of
any COVID-19 vaccine (AZD1222 or other) over the study period among the
specific populations considered to have missing information.
3. To describe the IRs of prespecified AESIs in subjects who received at least 1 dose
of AZD1222 in the matched population and subjects who did not receive any
vaccination against COVID-19 (concurrent unvaccinated comparators) in the
matched population, among the specific populations considered to have missing
information.
4. To estimate the relative and absolute risk of prespecified AESIs in subjects who
received at least 1 dose of AZD1222 compared with concurrent unvaccinated
comparators in the matched populations, among the specific populations
considered to have missing information, using a retrospective cohort design and
an SCRI design.
Exploratory objectives are as follows:
1. To describe the IRs of prespecified AESIs in subjects who received an mRNA
vaccine against COVID-19 (either Comirnaty or Spikevax) (active comparators)
and in subjects from the pre-pandemic period (2017-2018) (historical
comparators) in the matched population.
2. To estimate the relative and absolute risk of prespecified AESIs in subjects who
received at least 1 dose of AZD1222 in the matched population compared with
historical comparators in the matched population.
3. To estimate the relative and absolute risk of prespecified AESIs in subjects who
received 2 doses of AZD1222 in the matched population compared with subjects
who received 2 doses of active comparator (Comirnaty or Spikevax as per
homologous vaccination regimen) in the matched population.
Study 
design/period:
This is a multinational, retrospective, longitudinal cohort study using population-based 
automated health care data to ascertain vaccination details, patient characteristics, and 
outcomes of interest.
The study period will start on 04 January 2021, when the vaccine was first used in the UK, 
and will end approximately 24 months after it is introduced in the last country among 
participating data sources.

Post-marketing Effectiveness Study
Study name and 
title:
A post-authorization/post-marketing retrospective cohort study to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the AZD1222 vaccine to prevent serious COVID-19 infection in 
conditions of usual care (D8111R00005/ D8111R00017 [EU/UK]).
Rationale and study 
objectives:
Study design:
The effectiveness of vaccines in real-world setting may differ from efficacy estimated 
from clinical registration studies. At the time of regulatory approval, efficacy of 
AZD1222 will have been demonstrated in randomised clinical studies, but information 
about the effectiveness of this vaccine under real-world conditions will be lacking. One 
of the proposed approaches to address this is through a public-private partnership with 
COVIDRIVE, leveraging an existing brand-specific influenza vaccine effectiveness 
platform (DRIVE).
The primary objective is to estimate brand specific vaccine effectiveness against 
laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 among (primarily) hospitalised patients, overall 
and by age group (eg, < 18, 18 to 64 and ≥ 65 years old), after adjusting for potential 
confounders.
The current proposed study design is an observational, primary data, active-
surveillance hospital-based and/or Primary Care study, following a pre-defined study 
design (eg, test-negative design), which will be carried out in each participating site. 
However, final study design and data collection methodology is an outstanding subject 
for consortium decision in the next period of the public-private partnership set-up.
Study population:
Patients fulfilling COVID-19 case definition (eg, European Centre for Disease 
Prevention and Control [ECDC] definition) are enrolled at hospitals (or Primary Care) 
and tested for the virus of interest.

Rationale and study 
objectives:
A very rare syndrome of TTS has been reported following exposure to COVID-19 
vaccine. No causal association with COVID-19 vaccination has yet been established. 
The objective of this study is to evaluate an association between COVID-19 vaccine 
exposure and the TTS.
Study design:
A retrospective study using linked secondary databases in England. Data for the 
definitive study accessed through the NHS Digital Trusted Research Environment 
(TRE), providing national data coverage. Primary care data will be linked with 
vaccination, hospitalization, COVID-19 test results, mortality data. Initial exploratory 
analyses will be conducted using the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners 
sentinel network, ORCHID network database. Two primary study designs will be 
considered, a case control study and a self-controlled case series (SCCS). A cohort 
analysis will be considered, in addition or as an alternative to either of the primary 
study designs, pending feasibility assessment of the follow-up time.
Study population:
All patients, in England who are present in the integrated health records of NHS Digital 
TRE and/or Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners Clinical Informatics Digital 
Hub (ORCHID) database at the start of study period.

Rationale and study 
objectives:
Study design:
Study D8110C00001 – A Phase III Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled 
Multicenter Study in Adults to Determine the Safety, Efficacy, and Immunogenicity of 
AZD1222, a Non-replicating ChAdOx1 Vector Vaccine, for the Prevention of COVID-
19.
The primary objectives of this study are to estimate the efficacy of 2 IM doses of 
AZD1222 compared to placebo for the prevention of COVID-19 in adults ≥18 years of 
age; to assess the safety and tolerability of 2 IM doses of AZD1222 compared to 
placebo in adults ≥18 years of age; and to assess the reactogenicity of 2 IM doses of 
AZD1222 compared to placebo in adults ≥18 years of age (Substudy only).
This is an ongoing, Phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre 
study assessing the safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of AZD1222 compared to 
saline placebo for the prevention of COVID-19. Participants receive 2 IM doses of 
either AZD1222 or saline placebo, 4 weeks apart, on Days 1 and 29. All participants

PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
FOR AZD1222
Summary of Risk Management Plan for VAXZEVRIA (previously COVID-19 vaccine 
AstraZeneca) (AZD1222; ChAdOx1-S [recombinant])
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Vaxzevria (previously COVID-19 
Vaccine AstraZeneca, also referred to as AZD1222). The RMP details important risks of 
Vaxzevria, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Vaxzevria's risks and uncertainties (missing information).
Vaxzevria's Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Vaxzevria should be used.
This summary of the RMP for Vaxzevria should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Vaxzevria's RMP.

VI.1
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Vaxzevria is authorised for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS CoV 
2, in individuals 18 years of age and older. It contains Chimpanzee Adenovirus encoding the 
SARS CoV 2 Spike glycoprotein (ChAdOx1-S) as the active substance, and it is given by 
intramuscular injection only, preferably in the deltoid muscle.
Further information about the evaluation of Vaxzevria’s benefits can be found in Vaxzevria’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines Agency 
website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/vaxzevria-previously-covid-19-
vaccine-astrazeneca.
VI.2
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND 
ACTIVITIES TO MINIMISE OR FURTHER CHARACTERISE 
THE RISKS
Important risks of Vaxzevria, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Vaxzevria's risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:




Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging
The authorised pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that
the medicine is used correctly
The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) assessment, so that 
immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.
If important information that may affect the safe use of Vaxzevria is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below.
VI.2.1
List of important risks and missing information
Important risks of Vaxzevria are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
73 of 97

Version: 8
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Vaxzevria. Potential risks are concerns 
for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but 
this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs 
to be collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

Risk factors and risk groups
Very rare events of serious thrombosis with thrombocytopenia 
syndrome (TTS) (including fatal events), have been observed 
following vaccination with AZD1222 during post-authorisation use. 
There have been no reports of TTS in the AZD1222 clinical 
development programme.
There are no known risk factors for the development of thrombosis 
with thrombocytopenia following vaccination.

Very rare cases of thrombocytopenia, including immune 
thrombocytopenia (ITP), have been observed following vaccination 
with AZD1222 during post-authorisation use
Risk factors and risk groups
There are no known risk factors for the development of 
thrombocytopenia following vaccination. In general, individuals with a 
history of thrombocytopenic disorder, such as immune 
thrombocytopenia, the risk of developing low platelet levels should be
considered before administering the vaccine and platelet monitoring is 
recommended after vaccination as described in Section 4.4 of the 
SmPC

Table VI-4
Important identified risk: Guillain-Barré syndrome
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups
In the US study (D8110C00001), 1 SAE of a demyelinating event 
initially reported as Guillain-Barre syndrome occurred in a participant 
enrolled in the AZD1222 group. The SAE of GBS was subsequently 
amended to an SAE of Chronic inflammatory demyelinating 
polyradiculoneuropathy. Very rare events of GBS have been observed 
following vaccination with AZD1222 during post-authorisation use.
There are no known risk factors for the development of GBS following 
vaccination. In general, infection with the bacteria Campylobacter 
jejuni is one of the most common risk factors for GBS. People also can 
develop GBS after having the flu or other infections such as

Important potential risk: Immune-mediated neurological conditions
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
The association between vaccines and acute demyelinating events has 
been assessed in a range of studies and expert reviews, including a 
population-based analysis of nearly 64 million vaccine doses in the 
United States, which concluded that if there is an association between 
transverse myelitis and vaccines, it is < 2 per million doses of live-
zoster and live-attenuated influenza vaccines, and < 1 per million doses 
for other vaccines. Moreover, demyelinating diseases occur more 
frequently with infections than with vaccination. Taken together, the 
evidence is inconclusive regarding a causal relation between 
contemporary vaccines and acute demyelinating events.
Overall, there have been no clinically meaningful imbalances in the 
incidence of neurological AESIs between the AZD1222 and control 
groups in the AZD1222 clinical development programme.
Very rare events of immune-mediated neurological conditions have 
been observed following vaccination with AZD1222 during post-

There are no known risk factors for the development of neurological 
conditions following vaccination.

Table VI-7
Important potential risk: Vaccine-associated enhanced disease 
(VAED), including vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease 
(VAERD)
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine
There is a theoretical concern that vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 
may be associated with enhanced severity of COVID-19 episodes 
which would manifest as VAED/VAERD. Vaccine-associated 
enhanced disease was observed in children given formalin-inactivated 
whole-virus vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus and measles 
virus, and findings from experimental models of SARS-CoV and 
MERS-CoV infection suggest that VAED/VAERD may be possible in 
certain conditions.
Overall, there is no evidence of an association between AZD1222 and 
VAED/VAERD; proportionally more AESIs related to COVID-19 
have occurred in the control/placebo groups than among AZD1222 
recipients in the AZD1222 clinical development programme.
There have been no confirmed post-marketing reports of 
VAED/VAERD.
Risk factors and risk groups
There are no known risk factors identified for VAED/VAERD.

Post-authorisation development plan
Studies and activities in the post authorisation development plan are as follows:
Study D8110C00001 – A Phase III Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled 
Multicentre Study in Adults to Determine the Safety, Efficacy, and Immunogenicity of 
AZD1222, a Non-replicating ChAdOx1 Vector Vaccine, for the Prevention of COVID-
19.
Purpose of the study: The primary objectives of this study are to estimate the efficacy of 2 IM 
doses of AZD1222 compared to placebo for the prevention of COVID-19 in adults ≥ 18 years 
of age; to assess the safety and tolerability of 2 IM doses of AZD1222 compared to placebo in 
adults ≥ 18 years of age; and to assess the reactogenicity of 2 IM doses of AZD1222 
compared to placebo in adults ≥ 18 years of age (Substudy only).
Registry of Women Exposed to AZD1222 Immediately Before or During Pregnancy as 
part of the C-VIPER Registry Consortium (D8110C00003; Pregistry-sponsored)
Purpose of the study: The study objective is to estimate the risk of the most common obstetric 
outcomes (pregnancy losses, placentation disorders, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, 
and COVID-19), neonatal outcomes (congenital anomalies, low birth weight for gestational 
age, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and COVID-19), and infant outcomes (height for 
age, weight for height, developmental milestones until one year of age, and COVID-19) 
among pregnant women exposed to AZD1222 from 30 days prior to the first day of the LMP 
to end of pregnancy and their offspring relative to a matched unexposed reference group.
A post-authorisation/post-marketing observational study to evaluate the association 
between exposure to AZD1222 and safety concerns using existing secondary health data 
source (D8111R00006 [EU/UK])

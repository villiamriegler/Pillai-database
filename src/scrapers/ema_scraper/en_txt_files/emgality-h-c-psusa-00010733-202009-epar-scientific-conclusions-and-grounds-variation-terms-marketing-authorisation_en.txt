Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for galcanezumab, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In a cumulative review of serious hypersensitivity events, the information on the time-to-onset 
confirmed that although many of these events (36.7%) occurred immediately (within 1 day of 
galcanezumab administration), there were cases where the event occurred 2 to 7 days after initiation of 
treatment (14.2%), and cases where the event occurred after 4 or more weeks after initiation of the 
treatment (16.7%). The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing 
galcanezumab should be amended accordingly. 
Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC to add information that serious hypersensitivity reactions occur 
mainly within 1 day after galcanezumab administration, however, several cases have occurred also 
within days or within several weeks. The Package leaflet is updated accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for galcanezumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing galcanezumab is unchanged subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

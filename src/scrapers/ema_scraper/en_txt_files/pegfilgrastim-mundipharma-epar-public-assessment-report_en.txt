2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The intended indication for Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma is “Reduction in the duration of neutropenia and 
the incidence of febrile neutropenia in adult patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy 
(with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes)”, ATC code L03AA13. 
One 6 mg dose (provided as a single prefilled syringe) of pegfilgrastim is recommended for each 
chemotherapy cycle, to be administered at least 24 hours following cytotoxic chemotherapy. 
The applicant claims the authorisation for Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma as a similar product to Neulasta 
(EU) which was granted a marketing authorisation in the EU on 22 of August 2002. The proposed 
indication for Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma is the same as for the Reference Medicinal Product (RP) 
Neulasta (EU).

2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and its subsequent infectious complications represent the most 
common dose-limiting toxicity of cancer therapy. Febrile neutropenia, FN, develops in 25% to 40% of 
treatment-naïve patients during common chemotherapy regimens depending on the patient population; 
the dosage, timing and type of chemotherapy used1. The severity of febrile neutropenia depends on the 
dose intensity of the chemotherapy regimen, the patient’s prior history of either radiation therapy or use 
of cytotoxic treatment, and comorbidities.  
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Neutrophils contribute to both, the initiation and the maintenance of inflammation at sites of infection2. 
Chemotherapy regimens are associated with bone marrow suppression, resulting in reduced production 
of neutrophils (and also other blood cells like erythrocytes and thrombocytes). In clinical practice, 
neutropenia is the main limiting factor for the applicability of chemotherapy3. Both the duration of Grade 
4 neutropenia (defined as absolute neutrophil count [ANC] of <0.5 x 109/L) and the depth of the nadir 
after chemotherapy are correlated with the development of infectious complications4. The risk of 
developing febrile neutropenia (FN) is thereby driven by the chemotherapy dose and schedule and 
patient-related factors5. 
The principal regulator of physiological granulopoiesis human G-CSF is a glycoprotein that has been 
shown to regulate the production and release of neutrophils from the bone marrow, mediated via a single 
affinity extracellular receptor. By binding and signalling through granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 
receptor (G-CSFR), G-CSF has multiple effects on circulating neutrophils and on neutrophil precursors in 
bone marrow6.  
Stimulation of precursor cell proliferation in the bone marrow leads to an increase in the total mass of 
G-CSFR-expressing cells, which serves as a negative regulator of G-CSF levels through accelerated 
clearance of G-CSF7. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia is a significant dose-limiting toxicity in cancer treatment and a major 
risk factor for infection-related morbidity and mortality. Febrile neutropenia, FN, develops in 25% to 40% 
of treatment-naïve patients during common chemotherapy regimens depending on the patient 
population; the dosage, timing and type of chemotherapy used1. In the clinical context, FN is defined as 
an oral temperature of >38.3°C or two consecutive readings of >38.0°C for 2 hours and an ANC of <0.5 
x 109/L or expected to fall below <0.5 x 109/L [Klastersky, de Naurois et al. 2016]. The occurrence of 
febrile neutropenia often necessitates chemotherapy delays or dose reductions. It may also lengthen 
hospital stay; increase monitoring, diagnostic, and treatment costs; and reduce patient quality of life.

2.1.5.  Management 
Primary prophylaxis with colony-stimulating factors, CSFs, reduces the frequency of chemotherapy 
induced neutropenia, all-cause mortality during chemotherapy, and need for hospital care e.g. in breast 
cancer8. The administration of G-CSF can accelerate the development of neutrophils from committed 
progenitors, thereby reducing the incidence, duration, and severity of neutropenia9. Forms of G-CSF such 
as filgrastim and lenograstim including biosimilars, are administered by a course of daily injections, 
whereas pegfilgrastim allows once-per-cycle administration and may avoid suboptimal daily dosing.   
EORTC 2010 guidelines cover use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, G-CSF, to reduce the 
incidence of chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia in adult patients with lymphoproliferative 
disorders and solid tumours. Prophylaxis with a CSF is recommended for: 
•  Specified chemotherapy regimens with >20% risk of FN 
•  Specified chemotherapy regimens with 10% to 20% risk of FN, subject to patient specific risk 
factors such as elderly age (≥65 years) and neutrophil count 
• 
Patients with a previous episode of FN  
Pegfilgrastim and filgrastim can accelerate neutrophil recovery, leading to a reduced duration of the 
neutropenic phase in patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. Filgrastim was initially approved for the 
prevention of infection as manifested by febrile neutropenia in patients with nonmyeloid malignancies 
receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy. The pivotal study in patients with small cell lung carcinoma 
receiving cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and doxorubicin chemotherapy demonstrated an approximately 
50% reduction in the incidence of febrile neutropenia and duration of Grade 4 neutropenia, as well as 
statistically significant reductions in the incidence of hospitalizations and IV antibiotic usage10. 
Subsequent indications for filgrastim included engraftment following bone marrow transplantation, 
mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells and engraftment following transplantation, induction or 
consolidation chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia, and severe chronic neutropenia. Because of its 
relatively short half-life of 3.5 hours, filgrastim is administered once daily by SC administration no less 
than 24 hours after chemotherapy and continuing until absolute neutrophil count (ANC) recovery within 
each cycle of treatment. Shortcomings of filgrastim include the requirement for either daily visits to the 
clinic or home injections by the patient during the period of administration, frequent ANC monitoring, the 
possibility of missed doses, and suboptimal duration of treatment (either too short or too long). Efforts to 
overcome these limitations led to the PEGylation of the G-CSF protein. The subsequent PEGylation of the 
G-CSF protein filgrastim altered the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, resulting in slower clearance and a 
prolonged half-life (between 15 and 80 hours), thus permitting a single injection per cycle of 
chemotherapy11. Pegylation of filgrastim increases the size of filgrastim so that it becomes too large for 
renal clearance. Due to its high molecular weight, pegfilgrastim exhibits limited transport into the blood 
capillaries after SC administration and enters the systemic circulation via an indirect route, through the 
lymphatics. 
With a long half-life and target-mediated clearance, pegfilgrastim remains in the circulation until the bone 
marrow neutrophil precursors start to come back after chemotherapy. Pegfilgrastim (Neulasta) was first 
authorized for marketing in the EU and USA in 2002.

2.1.6.  About the product 
Filgrastim is a human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) manufactured via recombinant 
technology, resulting in recombinant human N-methionyl granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 
(rHU-Met-G-CSF) of 175 amino acids with a molecular weight of 18,800 Da. 
rHU-Met-G-CSF is produced by Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria and subsequently PEGylated by the 
conjugation of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety to the primary amino group at the N-terminus of 
filgrastim to increase the exposure duration and therapeutic activity of the protein due to decreased renal 
clearance. 
Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma is developed as a similar biological medicinal product with Neulasta 
(pegfilgrastim) as the Reference Medicinal Product (RP). Pegfilgrastim is a PEGylated (polyethylene glycol 
polymer chain), long-acting form of human recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; 
filgrastim). Filgrastim, the protein moiety of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma, is expressed in Escherichia coli 
(E. coli) and has an identical amino acid sequence as natural human G-CSF, except for an additional 
N-terminal methionine residue for the expression in E. coli. Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma is identical to 
Neulasta with regards to its amino acid sequence. It is delivered in the same formulation (with the 
exception of pH, which is 4.2) and presentation as Neulasta, in prefilled syringes containing 6 mg of the 
active substance (AS) in 0.6 mL solution for subcutaneous (s.c.) injection. 
The proposed indication was as follows: 
“Reduction  in  the  duration  of  neutropenia  and  the  incidence  of  febrile  neutropenia  in  adult  patients 
treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia 
and myelodysplastic syndromes).” 
The final agreed wording was as follows: 
“Reduction  in  the  duration  of  neutropenia  and  the  incidence  of  febrile  neutropenia  in  adult  patients 
treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia 
and myelodysplastic syndromes).” 
Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma therapy should be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in 
oncology and/or haematology. 
The posology is as follows one 6 mg dose (a single pre-filled syringe) of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma is 
recommended for each chemotherapy cycle, given at least 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy.

The clinical development programme for Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma was designed and conducted using 
a sensitive comparability approach, waiving clinical efficacy studies in patients. This approach was chosen 
because a validated surrogate marker is available for G-CSF, Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) was used 
within the clinical development programme of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma as a surrogate for efficacy. The 
clinical approach is furthermore supported by the prerequisite similarity on the physicochemical, 
biofunctional, and preclinical PK/PD level for Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma. 
Two clinical studies were conducted for Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma development: 
−  The  pivotal  study  (study  code:  B12019-101)  was  a  single-dose,  randomised,  double-blind, 
two-stage,  two-way  cross-over  PK and  PD  study  at  a  dose  of  6  mg.  This  study  enrolled  172 
healthy  subjects  and  assessed  PK  and  PD  as  co-primary  endpoints.  A  comprehensive 
immunogenicity  assay  programme,  based  on  actual  science  for  immunogenicity  testing  was 
implemented in the study.

−  The supportive study (study code: B12019-102) was a multiple-dose, randomised, double-blind, 
three-period, two-sequence crossover study to assess the immunogenicity and PD comparability 
of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and Neulasta at a dose of 3 mg. This study enrolled 96 healthy 
subjects  and  assessed  PD  and  immunogenicity  as  co-primary  endpoints.  It  comprised  a 
multiple-dose  parallel-group  part  in  order  to  most  sensitively  detect  differences  in 
immunogenicity, using a sensitive set of assays for immunogenicity testing. 
The development programme for Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma, including clinical development, is in line 
with current CHMP guidelines and guidance: 
•  Guideline on similar biological medicinal products (CHMP/437/04 Rev 1). 
•  Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology derived proteins as active 
substance: non-clinical and clinical issues (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev 1). 
•  Guidance 
on 
similar  biological  medicinal 
products 
containing 
recombinant  GCSF 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/31329/2005).  This  guideline  is  currently  revised,  see  Concept  paper  on  the 
revision  of  the  guideline  on  non-clinical  and  clinical  development  of  similar  biological  medicinal 
products 
containing 
recombinant 
granulocyte-colony 
stimulating 
factor 
(EMA/CHMP/BMWP/214262/2015). 
Moreover, the  clinical development programme  was based  on the  EMA  scientific  advice  the applicant 
received for Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma development in 2015: 
1.  The  CHMP  endorsed  the  assessment  of  clinical  comparability  with  two  clinical  trials  conducted  in 
healthy  volunteers.  This  study  population  is  most  sensitive  with  regard  to  detecting  any  potential 
differences between Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and Neulasta. Factors with potential impact on PK, PD, 
safety and immunogenicity, like drug-drug interactions, co-morbidities or immunosuppression are less or 
not present in healthy volunteers as compared to cancer patients. 
2. The CHMP agreed to the use of ANC as a validated surrogate marker for demonstration of comparable 
efficacy, particularly if investigated in healthy volunteers. 
3. The CHMP endorsed to investigate PK and PD comparability in a crossover study design as proposed for 
study B12019-101. 
4.  The  CHMP  confirmed  the  approach  to  evaluate  immunogenicity  in  a  clinical  trial  designed  as  a 
parallel-group study (study B12019-102) with repeated dosing of the same IMP. As immunogenicity is 
known to be low for filgrastim and pegfilgrastim, the investigation of immunogenicity in a parallel-arm 
design with healthy volunteers uses the most sensitive model for that purpose. 
5. The CHMP requested additional PD evaluation, and suggested a dose in the range of 2-4 mg. The 3 mg 
dose was selected for study B12019-102 as this is within the ascending part of the dose-effect curve of 
pegfilgrastim12, thus further enhancing the sensitivity of the chosen clinical study design. Also, the 3 mg 
dose was chosen based on operational reasons, to ensure precise dosing. 
Based  on  the  above,  no  confirmatory  clinical  studies  in  patients  were  conducted  to  demonstrate 
comparability of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma with Neulasta.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma is a pegylated (polyethylene glycol polymer chain), long-acting form of 
human recombinant granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF; filgrastim) and is developed as a 
similar biological medicinal product to Neulasta (pegfilgrastim) as the RP for Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma..  
The finished product (FP) is presented as a solution for injection containing 6 mg of pegfilgrastim (INN) as 
active substance (AS). The product is available in a 0.6 ml pre-filled syringe. Other ingredients are: 
sodium acetate; sorbitol (E420); polysorbate 20 and water for injections. 
It is delivered in the same formulation (with the exception of pH, which is 4.2) and presentation as 
Neulasta. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The INN for Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma AS is pegfilgrastim. It is a clear and colourless liquid. Human 
G-CSF is a glycoprotein, which regulates the production and release of neutrophils from the bone marrow.  
Filgrastim, the protein moiety of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma AS, is expressed in E. coli and has an 
identical amino acid sequence as natural human G-CSF, except for an additional N-terminal methionine 
residue for the expression in E. coli (recombinant methionyl human granulocycte colony-stimulating 
factor (rHU-met-G-CSF)). Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma AS is identical to Neulasta with regard to its amino 
acid sequence.  
Recombinant filgrastim is pegylated by the addition of a single 21 kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety 
to the amino terminus of the protein. The protein is not glycosylated and PEG residues are added. 
Filgrastim contains five cysteine residues. Four of these are involved in disulphide bonds (i.e. cysteines 37 
and 43, cysteines 65 and 75) while the cysteine at position 18 remains free.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The manufacture of the AS takes place at 3P Biopharmaceuticals in Spain. Appropriate GMP certificates 
have been provided.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The manufacturing process of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma consists of fermentation, cell lysis, inclusion 
body recovery, inclusion body solubilisation and refolding prior to purification via a series of 
chromatography and filtration steps to produce the filgrastim critical intermediate. Filgrastim is then 
purified prior to pegylation and further chromatographic and filtration purification steps follow. Finally, 
the AS is sterile-filtered at room temperature into a container-closure system (of specified composition) 
and stored as the final AS. No reprocessing has been claimed during AS manufacture. The containers 
comply with Ph. Eur. and USP requirements for container closure systems and plastic immediate 
packaging materials. Suitability of the container closure system has been investigated in a leachable 
study.  Relevant process controls are in place to ensure control and consistency of the process and of the 
Assessment report

AS. In general, the manufacturing process has been sufficiently described and in-process controls are 
adequately set to control the process.  
Control of materials 
All raw materials used in the AS manufacturing process are described and are either compendial grade or 
are tested according to in-house standards. The composition of the different media and buffers is 
sufficiently detailed. The starting material of the PEG moiety has been defined, activated PEG is 
re-classified as an intermediate further to the major objection raised during the procedure.  No human or 
animal derived materials are used in the AS manufacturing process, nor used in the manufacture of the 
MCB. 
Filgrastim, the protein moiety of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma AS, is expressed in E. coli cells. The complete 
nucleotide sequence for the expression of filgrastim is included in the marketing authorisation application, 
along with information on the synthesis of the vector and its transformation into cells. A two-tiered cell 
banking system is used and information is provided regarding testing of MCB and WCB and release of 
future WCBs. Cell banks have been tested for viable cells, purity, identity and genetic stability with 
characterisation also of end of production cells (EOPCs). Cell bank storage is described and is acceptable. 
The cell bank system (MCB and WCB) has been described, including information on the cell bank stability 
program and further testing on the EOPCs. Generation, testing and release of future WCBs will follow the 
same protocol as used for the initial WCB. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
A comprehensive overview of the process parameters and in-process controls (IPCs) in place throughout 
the manufacturing process of the AS is given. An iterative approach was utilised to identify critical process 
parameters (CPPs) for the critical process steps. The potential CPPs identified using a risk assessment 
failure mode effect analysis (FMEA) approach were further investigated in process characterisation 
studies and using knowledge gained from commercial scale manufacturing experience. This allowed 
identification of proven acceptable ranges (PARs) for scale-independent critical process parameters 
(CPP), which could be used to support assessment of impact on AS quality in the event of deviation from 
the normal operating range (NOR). The NORs have been set based on the data and experience gained 
from a suitable number of validation batches.  
Intermediate storage times were established by respective stability studies and hold times during 
manufacture are described and supported by data. Column resin cleaning, regeneration and re-use have 
been described as has membrane re-use, where applicable. The manufacturing process incorporates 
several mechanisms to ensure the AS meets predetermined quality criteria for microbiological control. 
Filgrastim is considered as a critical intermediate. Currently, the proposed combination of tests is 
sufficiently indicative of potency. Batch analysis and stability data of filgrastim are acceptable. The 
proposed storage condition and time for this intermediate in specified bags is accepted.  
The starting material has been defined for the PEG moiety. The manufacturing process has been 
elaborated in sufficient detail. Data on specifications of the activated mPEG and the starting material, 
batch release and stability data of starting material and intermediate and storage conditions have been 
provided.  
Process validation 
Following process development and scale-up to the commercial batch scale, the Process Performance 
Qualification (PPQ) campaign was executed to demonstrate that the process consistently delivers a 
product that meets pre-defined acceptance criteria for quality. Process performance consistency was 
demonstrated through the control of CPPs and via introduction of process performance parameters (i.e. 
IPCs), which were maintained within the pre-determined acceptance criteria. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/645013/2019

In general, all the CPPs and IPCs were within the pre-determined acceptance ranges. Any deviations were 
appropriately investigated and none challenged the conclusions of the process. The validation of the 
Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma AS manufacturing process provides sufficient evidence that the process, 
when operated within established parameters, performs effectively and reproducibly. The hold time steps 
used during AS manufacture were properly validated. Also, impurity clearance was validated, showing 
that the process is capable of removing process-related impurities in a consistent way to sufficiently low 
levels. Host cell proteins (HCPs), host cell DNA, and other specified residuals were identified as likely 
impurities in Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma AS. Acceptable levels of impurities were determined based on 
safety assessment that determined the acceptable daily exposure and historical data from commercial 
manufacturing batches.  
Clearance of relevant impurities to acceptable levels was demonstrated during the PPQ campaign and will 
be monitored during commercial manufacturing. In line with guideline ICH Q3D, elemental impurities 
were assessed. A risk assessment of organic solvents in Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma AS was also 
conducted. Stated impurities have been present in batches studied in non-clinical and clinical studies. 
For the chromatographic purification steps studies were performed to define and validate the column 
resin lifetimes.  
Manufacturing process development 
Manufacturing process development was performed in three stages: 
•  Early stage development of the upstream and downstream processes batch scale 
•  Scale up 
• 
Late stage development to confirm normal operating ranges (NORs) assigned to each CPP and to 
create proven acceptable ranges (PARs) as well as scale down model qualification. 
The biosimilarity testing, non-clinical and clinical studies were performed with the final commercial scale 
material. All process changes were introduced prior to non-clinical studies.  The non-clinical study as well 
as the clinical studies were conducted using post-change product material of the final commercial scale 
process. 
Overall the history of the manufacturing process development is well described. Changes to the process 
during development are described and justified sufficiently. 
Characterisation 
To ensure appropriate safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics, an extensive analytical program was 
executed to demonstrate that Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma AS has the expected structure and function 
based on known information about pegfilgrastim. Characterisation studies were designed to interrogate 
all aspects of structure and biological function and potency. Physicochemical properties investigated 
included: intact mass determination; polydispersity analysis; structural characterisation, including 
analysis of amino acid sequence, pegylation site, and disulphide bridging; higher order structure; 
post-translational modifications and biological activity. Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma AS mass distribution 
was in the expected range. The complete amino acid sequence was verified. The filgrastim protein is 
pegylated at the same site as described for the RP (the N-terminal methionine). The disulphide bond 
structure of pegfilgrastim and filgrastim was shown to be consistent with the expected structure. 
Post-translational modifications, other product-related variants and relevant degradation pathways 
within the protein sequence of pegfilgrastim were identified and quantified for both AS and FP. Stressed 
stability studies showed that some oxidation and deamidation may occur during shelf life. However, these 
modifications did not impact potency.

The potency of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma AS was analysed using a cell proliferation assay, which 
measures the biological activity of pegfilgrastim based on its binding to, and induction of the proliferation 
of specified cells. The method is closely aligned with the Ph. Eur. method for potency assay of filgrastim. 
The receptor binding properties of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma AS were also studied. 
Specification 
The AS specifications include tests for characteristics (e.g., colour and clarity of solution), identity, 
purity/impurities, content, potency and excipients. In general, the specifications proposed are acceptable 
and properly justified. The applicant is recommended to continue exploring the implementation of an 
alternative, more accurate analytical method to determine polysorbate 20 levels in the AS specification 
(see recommendation). In the meantime, to ensure adequate control of polysorbate 20, the applicant has 
introduced appropriate in-process controls on polysorbate 20 solutions used for formulation.  
Analytical methods 
Method descriptions for all non-compendial analytical procedures used for release and stability testing are 
provided. For the compendial methods no method descriptions are submitted which is acceptable, as they 
are performed according to the respective Ph. Eur. monographs. The descriptions are of sufficient detail. 
An in vitro proliferation assay is used for potency determination. It determines potency of human 
modified Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (i.e. pegylated G-CSF) using a specified cell line, which 
proliferates only in the presence of G-CSF. The cell proliferation is measured spectrophotometrically and 
compared to values of a reference standard. The method is closely aligned to the Ph. Eur. potency assay 
for filgrastim.   
Batch analysis 
Batch data were provided (several commercial-scale and process batches including non-clinical, clinical 
and process validation batches) showing that all batches were consistent and complied with the 
specifications. 
Reference materials 
The applicant has described the qualification of the different reference standards that were used during 
development of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma, as well as the primary and secondary reference standard 
that will be used for commercial production. In addition, an analytical testing programme for future 
secondary reference standards was provided. It was confirmed and included in the MAA file that any 
future secondary RS will be tested according to the test panel described in the dossier. In addition to the 
qualification against the primary reference standard, the future secondary reference standards will be 
calibrated against the International Pegfilgrastim Reference Standard. This information has been 
integrated into the dossier.  
Stability 
The proposed shelf life for the Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma AS in the specified container closure system 
has been described. 
Stability studies under long-term, accelerated and stress conditions have been performed on 
Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma AS. Stability studies are conducted in line with ICH guidance. 
The proposed shelf life is based on the current, available long-term stability data of AS batches.  
The primary stability studies included clinical batches and a suitable number of process validation 
batches. These studies have now been completed. Updated stability data have been provided including 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/645013/2019  
Page 15/74

additional data from process validation batches. Accelerated and stress condition studies have been 
completed. 
Supportive stability data from a development batch used in the pre-clinical programme (non-GMP batch) 
are also available. 
The initial stability data demonstrated that most of the AS quality parameters are stable and do not show 
any trends. Updated stability data revealed that most of the AS quality parameters are stable and do not 
show any trends. However, updated stability data revealed that results for some tests were above the 
limits for some batches (at several time points) due to storage in small scale containers.  No OOS results 
have been observed at FP level for stability, indicating that full scale AS is being stored properly. Stability 
data thus far for the commitment batches show that all parameters were well within the acceptance 
criteria. It was therefore demonstrated that the issues are related to storage in the small containers, and 
not to the AS itself. The study is planned to continue. Based on the data provided, the proposed shelf life 
for the AS can be accepted. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The final formulation of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma is a sterile, clear, colourless solution for injection in a 
disposable, single-use, 0.6 ml pre-filled syringe (PFS) with automatic needle safety guard.  
Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma is identical to Neulasta in terms of pharmaceutical strength, composition, 
route of administration, as well as presentation. Moreover, the formulation of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma 
is also identical to Neulasta (with a slightly higher pH for Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma of 4.2). The intended 
Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma commercial formulation is that used in clinical studies. 
The following excipients, all complying with Ph. Eur., are added at the final stage of the manufacturing 
process of the AS: sodium acetate (buffer), sorbitol (E420 (solvent)), polysorbate 20 (surfactant) and 
water for injection; if necessary, pH is adjusted with sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid to pH 4.2. 
Unlike for Neulasta, nitrogen is used during filling to decrease the potential oxidation of the product. This 
is acceptable. There are no overages. There is an overfill to allow withdrawal of 0.6 mL. 
Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma is presented in a pre-filled glass syringe (Type I glass), with a rubber stopper 
and a stainless-steel needle with an automatic needle guard. The needle cap is latex-free. The container 
closure was selected to mimic Neulasta and complies with EU requirements. The integrity of the container 
closure system has been studied during development. Leachables and extractables have been studied. 
The Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma prefilled syringe (PFS) is assembled with a specific needle-safety device 
(NSD). The same medical device is used in the RP Neulasta. This was assessed for suitability during the 
review. 
Formulation studies were performed with a focus on the optimisation of the formulation buffer. The choice 
of the buffer system and pH were discussed and the difference in the pH value compared to the RP in the 
formulation is sufficiently justified by data. This case is acceptable and does not exclude biosimilar 
comparability to the RP. 
Critical aspects in the manufacturing process development were discussed by the applicant. 
Microbiological attributes have been sufficiently discussed and do not raise any questions or concerns.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The FP is released by PharmaKorell GmbH in Germany.

Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The commercial manufacturing scale (fermentation) for the FP has been defined. The FP manufacturing 
process therefore comprises formulated bulk sterile filtration of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma AS 
(post-filtration integrity testing is conducted), syringe filling, stoppering and final packaging assembly. No 
further formulation is performed on Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma AS after it is introduced into specified 
containers. All steps of the Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma FP manufacturing process are considered critical 
and are thus strictly controlled during the manufacturing process. The processes for filling and packaging 
of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma follow established standard operations for the manufacturing of parenteral 
products in PFS. Critical process parameters and in-process tests are sufficiently described. 
Process validation studies, using an appropriate number of batches, were performed to demonstrate that 
the manufacturing process operated within the established parameters and was capable of effectively and 
reproducibly producing product that meets pre-defined acceptance criteria. The following validation 
studies related to the manufacturing of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma have been performed: cleaning 
validation; sterility validation; aseptic filling process validation, secondary packaging and shipping 
validation. 
The validation data show that the process is robust and well controlled. Since manufacturing and 
evaluation of additional batches is not possible within the EMA review procedure, the applicant is 
recommended to provide validation data on filling for additional FP batches (using the optimised nitrogen 
supply and filling speed), as soon as those data are available. 
Product specification 
The Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma FP specifications include general tests (e.g., colour and clarity of solution, 
extractable volume, container appearance) as well as tests for identity, purity, impurities, content, and 
potency. The applicant provided acceptable justifications for the specifications. Analytical methods were 
sufficiently described and non-compendial methods were validated. As there are no additional formulation 
steps prior to Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma filling, the product impurities present in Pegfilgrastim 
Mundipharma are the same as those identified and controlled in Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma AS.  
In general, the product-related impurities of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma are at low levels. Aggregate 
levels, which could be a potential safety concern, are at non-critical levels. Charged variants are also very 
low and the total pre- and post-peaks in RP-HPLC testing are also low. 
The applicant is recommended to revise the CEX-HPLC specification limit when data from further batches 
are available (see recommendation). 
For elemental impurities, a risk assessment has been performed for Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma AS. 
Extractable studies have been performed and no potential leachable compounds were found. For the 
control of microbiological attributes, sterility and endotoxin testing as well as container closure integrity 
are performed as release tests. Specifications are acceptable.  
Analytical methods 
The FP analytical methods are similar as those used for the AS release testing.   
Batch analysis 
Batch data from development, clinical and a suitable number of validation lots are presented. Batch data 
indicate consistent quality of batches which all comply with the specifications.

Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma FP is released against the same reference standards and control materials 
described for AS.  
Stability of the product 
A shelf-life of 24 months is proposed for Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma, when stored at 2°C - 8°C and kept 
in the in the outer carton in order to protect from light.  
Stability studies include commercial scale, development and process validation run (PVR) batches. The 
stability studies involve formal studies at long-term, accelerated and stress conditions, which are 
performed at 5°C ± 3°C, 30°C ± 2°C/65% ± 5% relative humidity (RH) and 40°C ± 2°C/75% ± 5% RH, 
respectively in accordance with ICH guidelines.  
The proposed shelf life for Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma is 24 months when stored at 2 to 8°C. No critical 
changes were observed at long-term conditions. The available stability data show that the FP is stable and 
support the proposed shelf life of 24 months for the FP. No critical changes were observed at long-term 
conditions. 
In addition, temperature excursion studies (out-of-fridge, OOF and freeze/thaw, F/T) are performed with 
batches to assess the stability of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma under normal use conditions. Photostability 
was also studied. 
The available stability data show that the FP is stable. Overall, the available data support the proposed 
shelf life of 24 months for the FP.  
The applicant is asked to provide the stability data for deamidation and oxidation when the long-term 
stability studies for FP specified batches 17001 and 17002 have been completed (see recommendation).  
The FP shelf life may be extended to 36 months via a variation procedure once 36m stability data are 
available for the 2 batches produced with the commercial process (lots 17001 and 17002). 
The applicant has provided the OOF stability results which demonstrate that Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma 
remains stable at 30 ± 2 °C for a single period of 96 hours after 36 months storage at long-term 
conditions. The F/T results demonstrate that Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma remains stable for two periods of 
less than 72 hours.  
The following special precautions for storage are therefore supported by the stability data and are 
approved in the SmPC: Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma may be exposed to room temperature (not above 
30°C) for a maximum single period of up to 96 hours. Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma left at room 
temperature for more than 96 hours should be discarded. Do not freeze. Accidental exposure to freezing 
temperatures for two periods of less than 72 hours does not adversely affect the stability of Pegfilgrastim 
Mundipharma. 
A shelf-life of 24 months is agreed for Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma, when stored at 2°C - 8°C. 
Adventitious agents 
Microbial adventitious agents are controlled throughout the manufacture of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma 
AS and Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma FP. The FP is sterile filtered and Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma is tested 
for sterility and container closure integrity at release. Only raw materials and excipients certified as of 
non-animal origin are used for manufacture of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma AS and FP. 
The host cell used for the manufacture of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma AS is an E. coli derivative. Based on 
the microbial nature of the manufacturing process and the materials used (none of animal origin), the risk 
of viral contamination of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma can be excluded.

Biosimilarity analysis 
Biosimilarity of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma to the RP was assessed during development using 
physicochemical and biofunctional data from side-by-side studies. The side-by-side physicochemical and 
biofunctional similarity assessments have been supplemented by side-by-side stability testing to 
demonstrate that the degradation behaviour of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma is similar to that of the RP. 
First, multiple batches of the RP were sourced in order to establish the Quality Target Product Profile 
(QTPP). An initial similarity assessment was performed at pilot scale using several Pegfilgrastim 
Mundipharma AS and several EU-authorised RP batches in order to steer the development process. The 
AS manufacturing process was then scaled-up to the final commercial scale, whereby the manufacturing 
process was adjusted and modified to fit to the increased scale. This scale-up was guided by the QTPP and 
the critical quality attribute (CQA) assessment. Next, a side-by-side study at commercial scale, compared 
Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma FP batches of commercial scale against RP batches. Finally, a second 
side-by-side study at commercial scale, compared several Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma batches and 
several RP batches. The non-clinical and clinical studies were performed with batches from the final 
manufacturing process at commercial scale. Moreover, non-clinical and clinical batches were included in 
the aforementioned side-by-side studies. 
Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma is delivered in an identical formulation and the same presentation as the RP, 
with the exception of pH. The pH of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma is 4.2 which is slightly higher than that of 
the RP. This was chosen to provide optimal conditions for a stable buffer system for Pegfilgrastim 
Mundipharma. This slightly increased pH in comparison to the RP has no impact on the structure and 
biological function of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma as demonstrated by the physicochemical and 
biofunctional similarity data. 
Analytical data obtained for a suitable number of EU-authorised RP batches over all stages of product 
development formed the basis of the similarity range for each quality attribute (QA) to which 
Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma results were compared. The analytical similarity exercise was performed on 
several Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma lots versus several RP batches, depending on the method and 
parameter tested. To analyse whether similarity to the RP was met, the results were evaluated against 
the similarity range. More detailed information including a justification on the batches used (age/number) 
for specific tests was provided. 
State-of-the-art, orthogonal analytical methods were employed to characterise structural and functional 
similarities and differences to demonstrate analytical similarity between Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and 
the RP. Also, comparative stability and degradation profiles were assessed.  
Primary Structure 
The complete amino acid sequence of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma was verified and is identical to the 
amino acid sequence of the RP. The correct formation of the disulphide bridges (Cys37-43, Cys65-75) was 
confirmed. No peptides containing disulphide bonded cysteine 18 or mispaired disulphides were found. 
Intact mass and PEGylation 
MALDI-TOF/TOF and capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) were used to compare the molecular weight of 
Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and RP. MS analysis showed that Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and the RP have 
similar mass. Mono-PEGylation at the N-terminal methionine was confirmed for Pegfilgrastim 
Mundipharma. There are 4 lysines (K17, K24, K35 and K41) which are considered putative sites for 
positional pegylation. No signals for the pegylated peptides containing lysines K17, K24, K35 and K41 
were found.

The PEG average molecular weight and polydispersity index were compared for Pegfilgrastim 
Mundipharma and RP side-by-side using ESI-MS and found to be similar. The size profiles and PEG 
moieties of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and the RP were also compared. 
Higher order structure 
Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma CD data and near-UV CD were compared with the RP and revealed a high 
level of similarity. Far-UV CD data suggested α-helices to be the predominant secondary structure (at 
25°C between 75% and 78%) with the 3/10 helix being the second most dominant structure. A very small 
percentage of β-sheets were determined.  
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed and showed that the melting temperatures of 
Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and RP (to assess the similarity of higher order structure) were comparable 
between the two products. Fluorescence spectroscopy was used to compare the conformation of 
Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and RP giving similar results. 
Purity and impurities 
Cation exchange chromatography (CEX) was used to evaluate similarity of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma 
and RP with respect to charge variant profiles. Overall, the profile of main acidic and basic variants of 
Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma closely matched that of the RP, suggesting comparable isoform profiles 
between the two products. The main variant level of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma showed higher amounts 
than observed in the RP, demonstrating a higher charge-related purity of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma 
compared to the RP. However, this difference is not clinically-meaningful given that the material analysed 
via CEX. was also used in a clinical study that showed a high degree of comparability between 
Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and the RP. Thus, it can be concluded that the charged variant profile of 
Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma is similar to the RP. 
Capillary isoelectric focusing (cIEF) was performed to compare the isoelectric points (pI) of Pegfilgrastim 
Mundipharma and RP. The pI of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and RP by cIEF was comparable, suggesting 
a comparable structure. One batch of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma showed a slightly higher pI. This 
difference is covered by the variability of the method. Moreover, this particular batch was also used in a 
clinical study that showed a high degree of comparability between Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and the RP. 
Reversed phase chromatography (RP-HPLC), which separates product variants, including oxidised and 
deamidated species on the basis of hydrophobicity, was performed and showed comparability between 
Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and RP purity profiles. The sums of pre-peaks and post-peaks were also 
similar between Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and the RP, suggesting comparable hydrophobicity-related 
impurity profiles between the two products. 
The level of methionine 122 oxidation was found to be similar between Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and 
the RP. The methionine 127 or 138 oxidation data showed variability, and results for two Pegfilgrastim 
Mundipharma batches were slightly outside the pre-specified similarity limits. However, this is not 
considered critical as these values indicate Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma contains less oxidation than the 
RP. Furthermore, no impact was observed in the clinical studies performed with these lots. 
Post-translational modifications were investigated. For both products, the impurity profile was found to be 
similar. The overall level of modifications is also similar, but slightly higher in the RP. However, the latter 
may be due to the age differences between Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and RP batches that were 
analysed. The most prominent post-translational modifications detected were the following: Single 
oxidation at tryptophan (W) 119 or methionine (M) 122; Single oxidation at methionine (M) 127 or 
methionine (M) 138; Single deamidation at glutamine (Q) 108, 120 or 121.

The identity measured via immunoreactivity (western blot analysis) for Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and 
the RP was similar. In addition, size exclusion chromatography (SEC-HPLC) was performed to compare 
the monomer and aggregate content of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and the RP.  
Analytical ultracentrifugation was performed to provide an orthogonal comparison of monomer, oligomer 
and higher oligomer proportions of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and the RP. Overall, sedimentation 
patterns were similar for Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and the RP, suggesting comparable amounts of 
monomers, and low and higher oligomers for the two products. 
Free PEG 
The levels of residual PEG for Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and the RP were compared by RP-HPLC-ELSD 
and revealed a high level of similarity. 
General properties 
Extinction coefficients of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma closely matched that of the RP, suggesting 
comparable amino acid content. Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma protein content for all batches was within the 
range of the RP, which reveals a high level of similarity for protein content between Pegfilgrastim 
Mundipharma and the RP. Osmolality and extractable volumes were also measured for Pegfilgrastim 
Mundipharma and RP and closely matched. 
Potency comparison by cell proliferation assay 
The relative potency of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and RP was compared by proliferative bioassay (cell 
proliferation assay measures the biological activity of pegfilgrastim) and in general, revealed a high level 
of similarity. This assay is closely aligned to the Ph. Eur. potency assay for filgrastim. 
Receptor binding comparison by SPR 
The functional similarity of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and RP was also found comparable by measuring 
receptor binding to the recombinant human G-CSF receptor (rhG-CSFR) using surface plasmon resonance 
(SPR).  
Results of comparative stability 
Comparative stability testing of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and RP was performed using a variety of 
stability-indicating methods. The results of the comparative stability testing showed a high level of 
similarity between Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and the RP for all attributes tested. Purity and impurity 
profiles as measured by RP-HPLC showed similar degradation rates. Potency also showed similar trends 
for both Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and RP.

Conclusion on biosimilarity (quality level) 
The primary structure of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma was found to be identical to that of the RP, with 
identical site of pegylation for both products. Molecular weight and polydispersity indicated similar PEG 
moieties between Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and the RP. Moreover, the higher order structure, 
product-related variants, and the impurity and aggregation profiles, were also shown to be similar 
between Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and the RP. Furthermore, relative potency and recombinant human 
G-CSF receptor binding kinetics were similar for Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and the RP. Comparative 
stability testing demonstrated that Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and the RP degrade in a comparable 
manner. In conclusion, the data of the physicochemical, biofunctional, and stability tests indicate that the 
proposed biosimilar biological product Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma is similar to the RP.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The AS and FP manufacturing process and process controls are described, as are raw materials. A cell 
bank system was established and tested and qualified. Critical process parameters were identified, and 
the process was appropriately validated. As regards the activation of PEG into activated PEG, the 
applicant has provided detailed information on the process and controls.  
As regards the FP manufacturing process, validation data on filling for additional FP batches (using the 
optimised nitrogen supply and filling speed) are expected post-approval (see recommendations). The AS 
and FP specifications proposed by the applicant are deemed suitable to control the quality of AS and FP. 
Analytical methods were described in detail. AS and FP specifications are properly justified. As regards 
CEX-HPLC, due to the limited data available for this quality parameter the applicant has proposed a more 
flexible limit. This is deemed acceptable however, the applicant has been asked to revise the CEX-HPLC 
acceptance limit when more data are available (see recommendations).  
The applicant will also submit a variation post-approval to set definitive specification limits for polysorbate 
20 based on a higher number of batches (see recommendations). 
For Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma AS, an appropriate shelf life and storage conditions have been defined. 
This shelf life is based on the current, available long-term stability data.  
The proposed shelf life for Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma is 24 months when stored at 2 to 8°C. The available 
stability data support this. The applicant should however provide, post-approval, the results for 
deamidation and oxidation when the long term stability studies for specified FP batches have been 
completed (see recommendations).  
The OOF study suggests that the FP remains stable when exposed to 30°C for 96 hrs.  
Biosimilarity analysis 
For the biosimilarity analysis, the applicant has performed an extensive comparability exercise between 
EU Neulasta and Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma FP (including both process validation and clinical batches). 
In general, all quality attributes analysed proved to be highly similar between Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma 
and EU Neulasta. For a few parameters slight differences were observed. However, these differences were 
properly justified and shown to have no impact on safety or efficacy of the product. Importantly, 
functional testing showed high similarity between both products. From a quality point of view 
Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma can be considered as biosimilar to EU Neulasta. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The manufacturing processes for Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma AS and FP are adequately described, 
sufficiently controlled and properly validated. AS and FP are sufficiently controlled. Container closure

systems of AS and FP were qualified. The currently available stability data for AS and FP do not indicate 
any decrease or trends for potency or purity. The data of the physicochemical, biofunctional, and stability 
tests confirmed that from a quality point of view Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma can be considered as 
biosimilar to EU Neulasta.  
In conclusion, the quality section of the Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma MAA file is approvable and several 
recommendations for future quality development are made. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
The applicant is recommended to continue exploring the implementation of an alternative, more 
accurate analytical method to determine polysorbate 20 levels in the AS. Upon method validation, 
this alternative method may be implemented via a variation procedure post-approval. When this 
variation will be submitted post-approval, it is expected that the specification be revised. 
The applicant is recommended to provide additional validation data on filling of FP using specified 
optimised conditions as soon as these data are available. 
The applicant is recommended to revise the limit for the CEX-HPLC specification of the FP 
(including an appropriate justification) if possible, when additional data are available. 
The applicant is recommended to provide the stability data for deamidation and oxidation when 
the long-term stability studies for FP batches have been completed. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
In  vitro and  in  vivo studies  were  conducted  to  assess  the  biosimilarity  of Pegfilgrastim  Mundipharma 
compared  to  Neulasta,  using  a  variety  of  batches  of  both  Pegfilgrastim  Mundipharma  and  Neulasta. 
Biosimilarity studies included in vitro cell-based models (M-NFS-60 cells, a murine myeloblastic cell line) 
and receptor binding assays by SPR; and in vivo PK/PD studies in normal and neutropenic rats. 
The nonclinical programme of pegfilgrastim included a series of in vitro comparative studies including a 
cell  proliferation  assay  on  a  specified  (M-NFS-60  murine  myoblastic)  cell  line  (this  method  is  closely 
aligned to the Ph. Eur method for potency assay of filgrastim) and a comparison of binding to granulocyte 
colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR) by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). 
A  GLP-compliant  non-clinical  comparative  study  in  healthy  and  neutropenic  rats,  which  evaluated 
pharmacokinetics  (PK)  and  pharmacodynamics  (PD) after a  single dose  of  15  or  100  μg/kg was  also 
conducted  to  further  support  the  similarity  demonstration  between  Pegfilgrastim  Mundipharma  and 
Neulasta.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Based on the CHMP Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use 
(CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr. 2) which states that proteins are exempted from the need to submit studies 
because they are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment due to their nature, the 
applicant submitted a justification for not submitting an environmental risk assessment. 
Pegfilgrastim is already used in existing marketed products and no significant increase in environmental 
exposure is anticipated. The PEG moiety of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma is unlikely to result in a significant 
risk to the environment because of metabolic breakdown before excretion in patients13,14 and a rapid 
biodegradation in the environment15, 16.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The potency of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma was measured on 6 Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma batches 
versus 12 batches of Neulasta by in vitro cell-based models (M-NFS-60 cells, a murine myeloblastic cell 
line) and the results show that their potency is similar.  
The binding affinity to the G-CSF receptor of either Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and Neulasta was also 
investigated using a validated Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). The binding affinities (Kd values) for 
Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma were found similar to those measured for the reference Neulasta.  
Comparability on the non-clinical level was adequately addressed according to the current regulatory 
requirements. Thus, the focus of the demonstration of biosimilarity was on in vitro biofunctional assays 
which revealed biosimilarity between Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and the reference medicinal product 
Neulasta. 
A GLP-compliant in vivo PK/PD study was additionally performed in normal and neutropenic male CD / 
Crl:CD (SD) rats with the aim to compare Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma versus reference. Both 
Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and Neulasta were compared in terms of absolute neutrophil counts (ANC). 
Results clearly demonstrate the intended pharmacodynamic effect. However, due to limitations of the 
neutropenic animal model and the fact that the study was considered descriptive only, a conclusion on 
statistically confirmed in vivo biosimilarity could not be drawn. Quality and clinical data are considered to 
be more relevant in this respect. Therefore, the in vivo data is acceptable, and no further discussion is 
needed.  
Safety pharmacology, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, single / repeat-dose toxicity studies, reproductive 
and developmental toxicity studies were not submitted and are not required as per the latest European 
biosimilar guidelines (i.e. Guidelines CHMP/437/04 Rev. 1, EMEA/CHMP/BWP/247713/2012, 
EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev. 1 and the annex to Guideline on similar biological medicinal 
products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as  the AS, non-clinical and clinical issues; guidance 
on similar medicinal products containing recombinant granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, 
EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/31329/2005). 
The justification for not submitting environmental risk assessment studies is acceptable. It is unlikely that 
residues of pegfilgrastim would persist in the environment or cause inadvertent environmental effects. 
The approval of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma is not expected to cause increases in environmental exposure 
above existing levels for this AS or result in any additional hazards to the environment during storage, 
distribution, use and disposal. Considering the expected exposure and the nature of the product, the 
absence of formal environmental risk assessment studies for Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma is considered 
justified. This is in accordance with the CHMP Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of 
medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2). 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical aspects of pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and toxicology for Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma 
have been well characterised and are considered acceptable. There were no further changes to the SmPC 
and the product information is aligned with the RP Neulasta.

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma was developed as a similar biological medicinal product to Neulasta 
(pegfilgrastim). The proposed indication for Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma is identical to the approved 
indication for Neulasta. The recommended dose is 6 mg pegfilgrastim to be administered S.C.. 
The clinical programme of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma was comprised of two studies in healthy 
volunteers. Clinical comparability of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and Neulasta was evaluated in the 
pivotal PK/PD study B12019-101 using the approved 6 mg dose. The supportive study B12019-102 
mainly monitored immunogenicity, but also assessed PD comparability of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and 
Neulasta, using a non-therapeutic, lower dose of 3 mg. The formulation used in the clinical pharmacology 
studies is the same as the proposed commercial formulation. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The clinical studies were conducted in the EU and were carried out in accordance with the ethical 
standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
Pegfilgrastim concentrations in serum were determined using a quantitative enzyme linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. The Human G-CSF DuoSet ELISA kit (R&D Systems) was 
modified to determine Pegfilgrastim in human serum and was validated for this purpose over a calibration 
range of 0.20 – 8.00 ng/mL at Celerion Switzerland AG.  
Study B12019-101 
This was a single-dose, randomised, double-blind, two-stage, two-way cross-over, PK/PD study of 
Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma versus Neulasta in healthy volunteers. Study drugs were administered as s.c. 
injections into the abdomen, at a dose of 6 mg. As recommended in different scientific advices, a 
wash-out phase of 6 weeks between treatments was applied to avoid any potential for carry-over effects.  
In order to account for the expected high variability of the relevant PK parameters (AUC and Cmax), the 
study methodology was based on a two-stage design, planning for a sample size re-calculation after 
completion of stage 1 and potential sample size adjustment for stage 2. The assumptions used to 
calculate a sample size of 172 subjects for stage 1 are considered appropriate (i.e. power of 90%, 
intra-subject CV of maximum 50% for PK parameters, drop out of 10%). According to the predefined 
decision rules, no stage 2 was performed. 
Blood samples for the determination of pegfilgrastim concentrations were collected during the in-patient 
phase, pre-dose and up to 96 h post-dose (day 5), and during the ambulatory visits in each period (days 
6 to 43). The primary PK variables were AUC0-last and Cmax, which was agreed upon in scientific advice 
EMA/CHMP/SAWP/380237/2015. AUC0-inf and tmax were evaluated as secondary PK variables. PK 
parameters were calculated for all subjects who received a dose of study medication (= PK set). 
To demonstrate PK comparability of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma to the RP Neulasta, the primary PK 
parameters AUC0-last and Cmax were evaluated using an α1-level of 0.0284. For these parameters the 
94.32% (=(1 - 2α)%) CI for the test/reference ratio were to be contained within the standard 
bioequivalence acceptance interval of 80.00-125.00%. The primary statistical PK analysis was performed 
on the model-based PK set, defined as all subjects with reliable PK data for both study periods. 
Subjects were randomised 1:1 to sequentially receive a 6 mg dose of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and 
Neulasta or vice versa. Of the 172 healthy subjects enrolled and randomised, 171 subjects received study 
medication (=PK set) and 163 subjects completed both study periods. Two subjects were excluded from 
the model-based PK set (N= 161) due to missing several consecutive study visits in one period. No major 
protocol deviations were reported. All subjects were healthy white males. Mean age of the 171 subjects 
included in the PK set was 40.9 years (range 19 to 55 years) and mean weight was 81.2 kg (range 61.3 
to 99.3 kg).

PK parameters AUC0-last, AUC0-inf and Cmax were presented by treatment and showed all a very high 
inter-subject variability (around 100%). Geometric mean t1/2 was about 40 hours and median tmax 
occurred at 16 hours after both treatments. No positive pre-dose samples were measured, except for one 
subject in Period 2.

Biosimilarity was claimed as the 94.32% CIs for the ratio of the test and RP geometric means for the 
primary PK parameters AUC0-last and Cmax were fully contained within the predefined acceptance interval 
of 80.00-125.00%. Although no statistical analysis of the secondary PK parameter AUC0-inf was planned 
per protocol, a post-hoc statistical analysis showed BE criteria were also met for this parameter.

**Only subjects of the model-based PK set with data available were included in the statistical analysis (N=146) 
A re-evaluation of the protein content data of the test and reference batches used in this study was 
performed based on an optimized UV method. As a result, a difference in protein content of more than 5% 
was determined between both batches with the Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma batch having a lower 
concentration than the Neulasta batch (9.57 mg/ml versus 10.20 mg/ml). The test/reference ratio for 
both AUC0-last and Cmax (95.23% and 92.84%, respectively) was below 100% and is therefore in line 
with a lower concentration of the Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma batch. In addition, the 94.32% CIs of the 
test/reference ratio for both parameters (not corrected for protein content) were fully contained within 
the acceptance interval of 80.00-125.00%. A post-hoc sensitivity analyses was performed correcting for 
the difference in protein content.  
Other sensitivity analyses that were conducted and included analysis in the subgroup of ADA-negative 
subjects and an analysis that excluded two outlier subjects. Results for these supportive sensitivity 
analyses were similar to the results of the overall analyses (see table below).

Sensitivity Analyses in Study B12019-101 (Model-Based PK Set) 
Of note, results for the PK parameters AUC0-t and Cmax showed a statistically significant period effect.  
Study B12019-102 
This was a randomised, multiple dose, three-period, two-sequence, cross-over study to mainly assess the 
immunogenicity and PD comparability of 3 mg Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma (T) and Neulasta (R) in healthy 
male volunteers. Subjects were randomised (1:1) to the treatment sequence T-T-R or R-R-T. Both 
treatments were administered as s.c. injection. Dosing was separated by a wash-out period of 6 weeks as 
was also done for study B12019-101. 
Blood sampling was sparse (7 PK samples in each period) since no statistical comparison of PK 
parameters was aimed for. PK concentrations and PK parameters (AUC0-120h, Cmax and tmax) were 
evaluated purely descriptively. 
Overall, 96 healthy male subjects were randomised and received at least one dose of study medication. 
Therefore, all subjects were included in the PK set. Mean age of the 96 subjects was 41.4 years (range 21 
to 55 years) and mean weight was 81.8 kg (range 62.4 to 99.5 kg). 1 subject was Asian, 5 subjects were 
black, and the majority was white. 
Results 
Based on sparse PK sampling, serum concentration time profiles were similar for Pegfilgrastim 
Mundipharma and Neulasta, with serum concentrations peaking at 12 hours post-dose in most subjects. 
Variability for the PK parameters was very high with geometric CVs above 100% for AUC and Cmax.

Figure 6: 
Mean serum concentration time profiles of pegfilgrastim (ng/ml) by treatment 
and period (PK set, N=96) 
As a result of a systematic handling error when the syringes for the first group of 28 subjects (period 1) 
were prepared, the doses administered to these subjects were between 2 and 2.8 mg pegfilgrastim 
instead of the per-protocol dose of 3 mg. Therefore, a sensitivity analysis was conducted excluding cohort 
1, and period 1 data from cohort 1. This resulted in a slightly higher exposure than in the overall analysis, 
which is in line with the exclusion of data from under-dosed subjects in Period 1. 
PK results from pooled analyses 
When comparing the PK results of the two studies (one conducted with 6mg and one with 3mg), it is 
apparent that a dose effect can be seen. Cmax values increased with increasing pegfilgrastim dose. 
Increases appear to be greater than dose-proportional, which is in line with literature data on the PK of 
pegfilgrastim (Roskos et al. 2006).

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Study B12019-101 
The following PD parameters were derived from the ANCs: 
Primary parameter 
AUEC0-last area under the ANC vs. time curve from dosing to last scheduled sample, by linear trapezoidal 
rule. 
Secondary parameters 
•  Emax maximum effect level (ANC) 
• 
tmax,E time of the maximum effect level 
•  CD34+ cell counts 
The primary statistical analysis is based on the model-based PD set (n=161, subjects who completed both 
treatment periods without important protocol deviation), PD set included 167 subjects. 
Results 
The secondary ANC parameters and CD34+ cell counts were evaluated descriptively between treatments. 
Table 14:  
Summary of the PD Parameters of ANC (PD Set, N=167) 
Geometric mean AUEC0-last and Emax were similar after administration of Neulasta and B12019 
(AUEC0-last of 7110 and 7128 h*G/L and Emax of 35.2 and 34.6 G/L, respectively). Variability was 
moderate with geometric CVs of less than 25%. The geometric mean ratio of AUEC0-last was about 100% 
and the corresponding 95% confidence interval was very close to 100% (98.67%; 101.75%).

When evaluating ANC time curves, after similar pre-dose values (3.315 and 3.214 G/L) a similar increase 
in mean ANC was observed after dosing of Neulasta and B12019: at 36 hours after dosing mean ANC were 
32.435 G/L and 31.971 G/L, respectively. ANC values remained on this level until 84 hours after dosing 
(30.484 G/L and 29.551 G/L, respectively) and decreased thereafter. Pre-dose level was reached again 
on Day 18 (3.413 G/L and 3.549 G/L, respectively).

In addition, CD34+ counts were analysed as secondary PD endpoint in this study. Similar increases in 
CD34+ cells were seen after administration of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and Neulasta. Values peaked 
at around 5 days post-dose and reached pre-dose levels on Day 12 post-dose. Overall, CD34+ profiles 
were very similar for Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and Neulasta. In addition, a post-hoc analysis of 
AUEC0-last of CD34+ was conducted, using the same model as for the primary PD analysis. In this analysis, 
the geometric mean ratio (Test/Reference) was 98.46, and the corresponding CI was 93.99; 103.14. 
Study B12019-102 
A total of 96 healthy subjects were enrolled and treated with study medication. The primary analysis of PD 
was  based  on  82  subjects  (model-based  PD  set).  The  model-based  statistical  comparisons  between 
treatments only made use of those subjects who completed all treatment periods without any important 
protocol deviation. 
Results 
All subjects in this study were male, and the majority (95%) was white. In the primary PD analysis set, 
median age was 44 years, median weight was 80.3 kg and median BMI was 25.3 kg/m2. The majority of 
subjects (84%) were non-smokers.

To demonstrate PD comparability of B12019 versus Neulasta, the primary PD parameter AUEC0-last was 
calculated. B12019 and Neulasta were assumed to be comparable with regard to PD if the 95% confidence 
interval of the test/reference ratio lies within the acceptance range of 80.00-125.00%.

The geometric mean ratio of AUEC0-last was 101,59% with the corresponding 95% confidence interval of 
99,58% and 103,63%. Emax was 28,4 G/L and median tmax of ANC was 36 hours after both treatments 
(PD set). Intra-subject CV was low, with 7.49%. 
The impact of underdosing Cohort 1 in Period 1 was evaluated in sensitivity analyses, excluding Cohort 1, 
Period 1, and Period 1 data from Cohort 1, respectively. In all analyses, the geometric mean ratio was 
around 100% in all sensitivity analyses, and the corresponding 95% CIs were not only fully contained in 
the 80.00-125.00% interval, but also in the tighter interval of 90.00-111.00%.  
When evaluating ANC time curves, similar profiles were seen for Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and 
Neulasta. Starting from similar pre-dose levels (around 3 G/L), comparable increases in mean ANC were 
observed after administration of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and Neulasta. Peak levels were reached at 
around 36 hours post-dose, and decreased thereafter. Pre-dose level was reached again on Day 22.

A slight period effect was observed with both Test and RP in the model-based PD set. ANC AUEC0-last 
increased 6.3% with Test and 4.97% with Reference when comparing period 3 with period 1. The 
applicant presented a table of ANC values by treatment and period excluding cohort 1 from all periods: 
only a slight increase in GMR of ANC AUECo-t was observed from period 1 to period 3 with the RP, whereas 
with the test product, no increase in ANC was seen (-1.4%). 
In addition, CD34+ counts were analysed as secondary PD endpoint in this study.

Similar increases in CD34+ cells were seen after administration of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and 
Neulasta. Values peaked at around 5 days post-dose, and nearly reached pre-dose levels at the last 
sampling point on Day 10 post-dose. Overall, CD34+ profiles were very similar for Pegfilgrastim 
Mundipharma and Neulasta. In addition to the pre-specified analysis, Emax of ANC and AUEC of CD34+ 
were analysed as secondary PD endpoints, using the Analysis of Variance model as for the primary PD 
analysis. In both analyses, geometric mean ratios (Test [T]/Reference [R]) were close to 100%, and the 
corresponding CIs were both fully contained within the acceptance interval of 80.00 - 125.00%.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Two studies investigated the clinical pharmacology of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma (B12019-101 and 
B12019-102). The reference medicinal product in both clinical studies was EU-approved Neulasta. While 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/645013/2019  
Page 44/74

the focus of study B12019-101 was on the PK/PD comparability of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and 
Neulasta, study B12019-102 focused on the PD and immunogenicity comparability of the two products. 
The main difference between the two studies was the dose used, 6 mg in study B12019-101 and 3 mg in 
study B12019-102. Further the latter study contained 3 periods to evaluate ADA formation after repeated 
doses in a partial parallel design. The treatment was switched after two periods for PD analysis with the 
advantage of a cross-over design. The applicant did not submit studies on distribution, elimination, 
dose-proportionality and time dependencies, special populations, pharmacokinetics interaction studies, 
pharmacokinetics using biomaterials and mechanism of action. This is acceptable as according to the 
guideline EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/31329/2005, these studies are not required. 
In general, the applicant´s development program to demonstrate pharmacokinetic (PK) and 
pharmacodynamic (PD) similarity between Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and Neulasta is considered 
adequate and was performed in line with the guidance on similar biological products and in line with 
scientific advice received: 
-  Both clinical studies were conducted in healthy subjects. Compared to cancer patients receiving 
chemotherapy,  healthy  subjects  lack  co-morbidities  and  co-medications  and  are  not 
immunosuppressed.  Therefore,  it  was  agreed  that  they  represent  the  most  sensitive  study 
population for conducting the PK and PD comparison. 
- 
In the pivotal study, B12019-101, a fixed subcutaneous dose of 6 mg pegfilgrastim was used. It 
was agreed in the EMA scientific advice that this dose has sufficient PK assay sensitivity since it is 
in the ascending part of the dose-response profile for AUC and Cmax. In the supportive study, PD 
comparability was investigated at a lower dose than 6 mg as recommended in the same scientific 
advice. The underlying rationale for this was that the 6 mg dose alone may not be sufficiently 
discriminative  and  sensitive  for  the  comparative  investigation  of  PD  between  Pegfilgrastim 
Mundipharma and Neulasta.  
- 
In both studies a wash-out period of 6 weeks was applied between treatments to avoid bias in the 
PK analysis due to increased clearance mediated by the neutrophils not returned to the baseline 
level. 
-  Given  the  expected  high  inter-  and  intra-individual  variability  for  pegfilgrastim,  a  cross-over 
design was chosen to evaluate PK and PD comparability in pivotal study B12019-101. In addition, 
this study was planned as a two-stage design with sample size re-estimation after stage 1. A 
conservative assumption of an intra-subject CV of 50% was used for sample size estimation for 
stage 1. 
- 
In study B12019-102, ADA formation was evaluated after the first two periods (TT or RR) prior to 
switching to the comparative product in period 3. To assess comparative ADA formation after two 
applications corresponding to a parallel design is acceptable. PD response (ANC, CD34+) was 
compared, based on the data obtained from all three periods, making use of the advantages of a 
cross-over design (T/R ratios based upon sequences T-T-R and R-R-T). 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pegfilgrastim concentrations in serum were determined using an ELISA technique. The applicant provided 
additional validation data that showed acceptable precision and accuracy, dilutional linearity and sample 
long-term stability. However, selectivity, without applying any correction for endogenous G-CSF, could 
only be shown if the acceptance criteria were widened to 30% and not for not for 20% (25% for LLOQ) as 
defined in the guideline. Since the pivotal PK study B12019-101 had a cross-over design, this bias 
associated with the presence of low levels of endogenous G-CSF should have influenced the sample 
measurement of both drugs in a similar way and is thus considered of minor relevance for the similarity 
assessment. In the pivotal study B12019-101, PK equivalence is claimed as the 94.32% CIs for the ratio

of the test and RP geometric means for the primary and secondary PK parameters AUC0-last, AUC0-inf and 
Cmax were fully contained within the standard bioequivalence acceptance interval of 80.00-125.00%.  
A difference in protein content of more than 5% between the test and reference batches was determined 
post-study using an optimized UV method. Although this %difference is not in line with the guideline on 
the investigation of bioequivalence, the impact on the PK comparability conclusions is considered to be 
minor. The test/reference ratio for both AUC0-last and Cmax (95.23% and 92.84%, respectively) was 
below 100% and is therefore in line with a lower concentration of the Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma batch 
compared to the Neulasta batch used in this study. Furthermore, bioequivalence was demonstrated 
without applying a correction for protein content, which is considered the worst-case scenario. 
The results for the PK parameters AUC0-t and Cmax showed a statistically significant period effect. 
Looking at results of LS means by period, it appears that AUC and Cmax are lower on average in Period 
2. This is in line with what was to be expected. It is known that pegfilgrastim is mainly eliminated by 
neutrophils/precursors (Yang et al., Clin. Pharmacokinet., 2011) and the period effect observed in study 
B12019-101 was most likely attributed to target-mediated clearance of pegfilgrastim by the increasing 
number of neutrophils. The decrease in pegfilgrastim plasma levels could theoretically also be attributed 
to appearance of ADAs decreasing free pegfilgrastim concentrations. Following an analysis of the 
relationship between positive signals for PEG-reactive ADAs in period 1 and the PK response profile to 
administration of 6 mg pegfilgrastim (B12019 or Neulasta) in period 2, a trend for a slight reduction in the 
PK response in Period 2 for the positive PEG-reactive ADA sub-population was observed, regardless of the 
identity of the treatment sequence (see Immunogenicity in the clinical safety section). Moreover, subjects 
classified as ADA-positive showed no meaningful differences in PK, PD or other clinical parameters as 
compared to ADA-negative subjects. Overall, a modest impact of positive PEG-reactive antibody following 
the first administration of 6 mg pegfilgrastim (Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma or Neulasta) on PK (AUC) 
following administration of a second 6 mg dose of pegfilgrastim could not be excluded. The marginal 
reduction in PK (AUC) was not associated with any reduction in the PD (AUEC for ANC). This observation 
does not have an effect on biosimilarity. 
Study B12019-102 was not intended to evaluate PK equivalence between Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and 
Neulasta. However, based on sparse PK sampling, similar PK profiles were observed and overall, the PK 
data of study B12019-102 support the results on PK comparability between Neulasta and Pegfilgrastim 
Mundipharma from study B12019-101. 
Pharmacodynamics 
In line with CHMP scientific advice, PD data in healthy volunteers (absolute neutrophil and CD34+ counts) 
were evaluated as surrogate marker of clinical efficacy and support of biosimilarity of both products. For 
the assessment of the PD comparability between Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and Neulasta, the primary 
PD parameter AUEC0-last of ANC was calculated, which had to be contained within the standard 
acceptance range of 80% - 125% with 95%CI, also for other pharmacodynamic parameters. Lower dose 
of pegfilgrastim, that is considered more sensitive to detect differences between products, has been 
tested in repeat dose study B12019-102. In this study, the primary endpoint for PD comparability was 
based on the data obtained from all three periods, making use of the advantages of a cross-over design 
(T/R ratios based upon sequences T-T-R and RR- T will be more robust and precise than estimates 
obtained from a parallel design). As secondary pharmacology the CD34+ cell count were also studied. The 
time course of mean CD34+ cells was similar when comparing the test and the RPs. 
The primary PD endpoints have been met in both studies. At the time of Scientific Advice the applicant has 
justified the use of the 80-125 boundaries in analogy to the PK evaluation and with reference to the 
bioequivalence guideline. However, a justification has been asked whether the chosen boundaries are 
sufficiently tight based on clinical argumentation, and why it is not necessary to use e.g. 85-118, or 
90-111 as equivalence margins. Following scientific advice, equivalence margins of 90.00-111.00% were 
Assessment report

retrospectively applied for the PD evaluation in both studies with Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma. The 
provided PD results support comparability of PD parameters with tighter equivalence margins. 
In the Study B12019-101, the PD response was similar between test and RPs. The GMR of the ANC 
AUEC0-last was almost 100%; the 95% CI with 99.16; 102.65 was narrow and well within the acceptance 
interval of 80.00-125.00%. The secondary endpoints Emax, tmax of ANC and CD34+ count were initially 
presented only descriptively, their mean values were comparable. 
A period effect was evident in ANC response, i.e. AUEC being higher with test and reference in period 2. 
Higher neutrophil counts are likely to increase pegfilgrastim clearance, resulting in a slightly lower 
exposure in period 2. This observation does not have an effect on biosimilarity. 
In the Study B12019-102, PD comparability between Test and Reference was shown. In the primary 
analysis the GMR of AUEC 0-last (PEP) was near 100%. The corresponding 95% confidence interval was 
very close to 100% (99.58%; 103.63%) easily fulfilling the predefined similarity criteria of 80-125%. The 
intra-subject CV of 7.49% was low. Also, the descriptively presented secondary PD endpoints ANC Emax, 
tmax and CD34+ cell count were very similar. Further sensitivity analyses with exclusion of cohort 1, 
period 1, period 1 data of cohort 1) also supported similarity for PD endpoints. 
For Studies B12019-101 and B12019-102, the applicant provided a statistical analysis complementing 
the mean CD34+ AUC0-last, Emax (post-hoc analysis) and median tmax values. The results presented for 
CD34+ parameters support the comparability. 
In the pooled analyses of both PK/PD studies, mean responses of 6 mg pegfilgrastim were about 22% 
higher with Emax and 15% higher with AUEC0-last compared to 3 mg. Tmax was observed at 60h post 
dose with 6 mg and 36h post-dose with 3 mg. Dose difference was somewhat more perceivable regarding 
CD34+. This observation does not have an effect on biosimilarity. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
From  a  PK  perspective,  the  claim  of  bioequivalence  is  acceptable  since  the  94.32%  CIs  of  the 
test/reference ratio for both the primary and secondary PK parameters were fully contained within the 
acceptance interval of 80.00-125.00% in the pivotal study B12019-101.  
Therefore,  overall  PK/PD  data  from  the  two  studies  show  that  similarity  between  Pegfilgrastim 
Mundipharma and the RP Neulasta could be demonstrated. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
No dedicated efficacy studies were performed in patients. For a biosimilar candidate to a pegfilgrastim, 
pivotal evidence for similar efficacy can be derived from the similarity in physicochemical, functional, 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic comparisons. Therefore, a dedicated comparative efficacy trial 
was not considered necessary. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The clinical programme of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma comprises two studies in healthy volunteers that 
contributed to safety and immunogenicity analyses. The approved 6 mg dose was used in the pivotal 
pharmacokinetic (PK)/ pharmacodynamic (PD) study B12019-101. The supportive study B12019-102 
mainly monitored immunogenicity, but also assessed PD comparability of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and 
Neulasta, using a non-therapeutic, lower dose of 3 mg which was administered two times in a parallel 
group part of the study. After two administrations of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma, subjects received one

administration of Neulasta, and in the other arm subjects received Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma after two 
administrations of Neulasta. 
Safety analyses are based on the safety population, defined as all subjects who have received at least one 
dose of study medication. Safety results are presented for the pooled studies, as well as for the individual 
studies. For pooling of safety data, the first period of both studies was regarded, as well as all periods 
from both studies. The rationale for presenting also individual study data is based on the two different 
doses and dosing regimens in the two studies (two doses of 6 mg in study B12019-101 versus three doses 
of 3 mg in study B12019-102). 
Safety was evaluated from: 
•  Clinical safety assessments (reported AEs, physical examinations including vital signs and digital 
standard 12-lead ECGs, local tolerability), 
• 
Laboratory safety assessments (standard haematology, coagulation and biochemistry analyses, 
urinalysis). 
Patient exposure 
A total of 268 subjects were randomised, 172 and 96 subjects in Studies B12019-101 and B12019-102, 
respectively. One subject in Study B12019-101 was randomised but not treated (due to the non- 
treatment-emergent AE tachycardia in the pre-dose ECG). Thus, this subject was not included in the 
safety population. Therefore, the safety population in Studies B12019-101 and B12019-102 consisted of 
171 and 96 subjects, respectively. The pooled safety population comprised 267 subjects.

Subjects in Study B12019-101 were exposed to two 6 mg doses of study drug (one dose each of 
Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and Neulasta). Subjects in Study B12019-102 were exposed to three 3 mg 
doses of study drug. Depending on the sequence, subjects received either two doses of Pegfilgrastim 
Mundipharma and one dose of Neulasta (Sequence T-T-R), or two doses of Neulasta and one dose of 
Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma (Sequence R-R-T).  
A total of 259 subjects received at least one dose of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma (3 mg or 6 mg); 46 of 
these received two doses. A total of 260 subjects received at least one dose of Neulasta (3 mg or 6 mg); 
45 of these received two doses.  
In Study B12019-101, all 163 subjects who completed the study, and the two subjects who discontinued 
after dosing in Period 2, i.e. 165 subjects, received two dosings of 6 mg study drug. Six subjects were 
dosed in Period 1 only (three with Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and three with Neulasta).

In Study B12019-102, all 84 subjects who completed the study, and the three subjects who discontinued 
after dosing in Period 3, i.e. 87 subjects, received one injection of 3 mg study drug per period. Five 
subjects were dosed in Period 1 only, and four subjects were dosed in Period 1 and 2. One subject 
randomised to sequence RRT was treated in an incorrect treatment sequence (TRR instead of RRT).

Adverse events 
Due to the special design of study B12019-102 (three-periods, two-sequences cross-over), the 
frequencies of TEAEs were presented by treatment across all periods, but also by treatment utilizing data 
from Period 1 and 2 only (referring to the onset of the AEs, comparing incidences of AEs which occurred 
during the first two periods in which the study followed a parallel design).

AE=adverse event, ALT=alanine aminotransferase, AST=aspartate aminotransferase, GGT=gamma 
glutamyltransferase, MedDRA=Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, N=number of subjects, PT=preferred 
term, R=reference (Neulasta), SOC=System Organ Class, T=test (Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma), 
TEAE=treatment-emergent adverse event. AEs were coded using MedDRA Version 18.1 (study B12019-101) and 19.1 
(study B12019-102). Percentages are based on N. Adverse events are sorted by descending frequency in SOC (pooled 
studies). The sum of subjects with events at the PT level may be greater than the number of subjects with an event at 
the SOC level. One subject may have had more than one PT event, but was only counted once at the SOC level.  
The most frequent TEAEs by SOC were musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (80.9% of 
subjects overall), followed by nervous system disorders (45.3% overall), infections and infestations 
(35.2% overall), and metabolism and nutrition disorders (30.7% overall). Most frequently reported PTs 
were back pain (78.3% overall), headache (43.4% overall), nasopharyngitis (32.2% overall), 
hypoglycaemia (29.2% overall) and pain in extremity (21.3% overall).

In the Study B12019-101, the number of subjects with TEAEs was similar: 81.3% of the subjects reported 
494 TEAEs after Neulasta and 86.0% reported 485 TEAEs after B12019. The most frequently reported 
TEAE was back pain, experienced by 63.7% of the subjects after Neulasta and 66.7% after B12019, 
followed by headache, experienced by 30.4% of the subjects after Neulasta and 31.6% after B12019. 
Notably higher TEAE frequencies after Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma than after Neulasta were seen in Study 
B12019-102 for the SOCs “gastrointestinal disorders” (16.7% vs. 4.2%) and “respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders” (10.4% vs 4.2%). The imbalance in these SOCs was mainly driven by subjective 
measurable symptoms and signs such as e.g. nausea (R: 1.0% vs T: 8.3%) or cough (R: 1% vs T: 6.3%). 
A root cause analysis has been provided to investigate potential possibilities.  
Most frequent in both studies and with both treatments were TEAEs in the SOC musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders. In Study B12019-101, these were reported for 70.2% and 71.3% of subjects 
after Neulasta and Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma, respectively (first period: 81.4% and 70.6%). In Study 
B12019-102, a slightly lower percentage of subjects experienced such AEs, 60.4% and 57.3% after 
Neulasta and Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma, respectively (first period: 63.8% and 69.4%). These slight 
differences in AE frequencies do not point to a pronounced dose effect. When looking at AEs occurring in 
the first treatment period only, numbers were similar, which indicates that musculoskeletal AEs occur 
with similar frequencies at the beginning of treatment and after re-exposure. 
Within this SOC, back pain and pain in extremity accounted for the majority of TEAEs, while neck pain, 
arthralgia, myalgia, musculoskeletal (chest) pain, bone pain and groin pain were each reported in less 
than 10% of subjects.  
In both studies, around 20% of subjects experienced drug-related hypoglycaemia after dosing with 
Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma or Neulasta. Hypoglycaemia had to be reported as AE if glucose levels 
decreased to 3.8 mmol/L or below. For further details on events of hypoglycaemia and glucose 
concentrations, see Section laboratory findings below. 
Injection site reactions 
Local tolerability at the injection site was assessed pre-dose and several times post-dose in each period. 
Evaluation made use of the injection site reaction score, ranging from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). The 
incidence of injection site reactions was higher in study B12019-101, using the 6 mg dose and overall the 
incidence was higher with Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma relative to Neulasta (7 vs. 4). In particular injection 
site haematoma were more frequent with Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma treatment (R: 0.0% vs T: 1.8% in 
study B12019-101). The 267 subjects participating in the two Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma studies 
received around 600 injections of study drug. Considering data from both studies, only 11 of 267 subjects 
(4.1%) had injection site reactions, 7 (2.6%) after Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and 4 (1.5%) after 
Neulasta. In all subjects, injection site reactions occurred only once, even though subjects received 2 
injections in Study B12019-101 and 3 injections in Study B12019-102. For the individual PTs, some 
imbalances were seen, e.g. puncture site pain occurred only under Neulasta, while injection site 
haematoma/haematoma was more frequent after Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No death occurred during the two studies in healthy volunteers. Serious adverse events were reported for 
one subject in study B12019-101 (suffering from multiple injuries due to a car accident) and three 
subjects in study B12019-102 (two suffering from influenza and one suffering from local swelling due to 
a facelift). The reported serious events can be considered as unrelated to the study drug.

Laboratory findings 
Laboratory AEs 
Blood samples for haematology and biochemistry parameters and urine samples for urinalysis were 
collected at screening, on Day -1, and several times post-dose. In both clinical studies with Pegfilgrastim 
Mundipharma, the investigator decided whether a laboratory abnormality was considered as an AE. In 
addition, for certain laboratory parameters of interest (i.e. LFTs, creatinine, electrolytes, haematology, 
muscle and coagulation) specific ranges were defined, outside of which laboratory values were considered 
clinically relevant, and had to be reported as laboratory AE. For Study B12019-101, this reporting process 
(including the setup of threshold values for laboratory AEs) was implemented during the study, while for

Pooled analyses, Table 4.2.1 in Module 5.3.5.3. 
By far the most frequent laboratory AE was hypoglycaemia, reported in around 20% of subjects in Studies 
B12019-101 and B12019-102. Decreases in serum glucose after administration of study drug were seen 
in both clinical studies and were comparable between treatments.  
In Study B12019-101, mean glucose decreased from 5.13 mmol/L on Day -1 to a minimum of 3.88 
mmol/L at Day 3 (48 hours) after dosing with Neulasta, and from 5.11 mmol/L on Day -1 to a minimum 
of 3.93 mmol/L at Day 3 (48 hours) after dosing with Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma. Thereafter blood 
glucose increased again and reached pre-dose level on Day 15.  
In Study B12019-102, mean glucose decreased from 5.13 mmol/L on Day -1 to a minimum of 3.93 
mmol/L at Day 3 (48 hours) after dosing with Neulasta, and from 5.13 mmol/L on Day -1 to a minimum 
of 3.94 mmol/L at 48 hours after dosing with Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma. Thereafter blood glucose 
increased again and reached pre-dose level on Day 15.  
Comparable mean decreases in serum glucose of around 1 mmol/L were observed in both studies and 
after both treatments, reaching a maximum at 48 hours after dosing. The similarity of results from the 
Assessment report

two studies suggests that the effect is not dose dependent at the two doses studied. None of the events 
of hypoglycaemia was associated with clinical signs or symptoms or required intervention.  
In both studies, an inverse relationship was observed for the time pattern of glucose and ANC 
concentrations. Mean ANC increased until 36 hours after dosing, remained on this level until 84 hours 
after dosing and decreased thereafter. Pre-dose level of ANC was reached again on Day 18. Mean glucose 
decreased until 48 hours after dosing, increased thereafter and reached pre-dose level again on Day 15. 
Other laboratory AEs reported by more than 2% of subjects in any group were increases in: ALT, creatine 
phosphokinase, C-reactive protein, GGT, AST, and blood bilirubin, as well as haematuria. 
In Study B12019-102, two subjects discontinued due to increased ALT. In all other subjects, AEs of ALT, 
AST and GGT were mild to moderate, reversible, and did not require intervention. 
Vital signs and physical examination 
Blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate and tympanic temperature were measured at screening, 
pre-dose on Day 1, several times post-dose in each period and at the follow-up, after at least 5 minutes 
rest in supine position. Physical examination was performed during screening, at admission and during 
the follow-up examination.  
In both studies, mean values for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate and 
body temperature showed no clinically relevant changes after dosing with study drug or differences 
between treatments. 
ECG 
In study B12019-101, electrocardiograms were recorded at screening, before and after dosing and at the 
follow-up. In study B12019-102 Electrocardiograms were recorded at screening, on Day -1 and prior to 
discharge on Days 5 of each period and on Day 43 of period 3. All 12-lead ECGs were normal or abnormal 
without clinical significance in both studies, except for one subject, who suffered from tachycardia before 
study drug administration in study B12019-101. Thus, this subject was not treated with study drug and 
not included in the safety population. 
Immunological events 
Immunogenicity 
Analytical methods 
A multi-tier test strategy (screening, confirmatory and neutralisation assay) was applied to evaluate 
relative immunogenicity of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma versus Neulasta. Identical bioanalytical methods 
were applied to studies B12019-101 and B12019-102.  
Initially, samples were subjected to a screening assay. The bridging assay format used biotinylated 
Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and Sulfo-TAG-Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma as the labelled antigens, and 
electrochemiluminescence (ECL) detection of solid-phase-bound complexes of ADA with bridged labelled 
antigen on streptavidin-coated MSD microtiter plates. An in-house prepared rabbit, affinity-purified, 
anti-Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma antibody reagent was selected as the primary positive control, whereas 
a commercial mouse anti-PEG IgM antibody was selected as a positive control for monitoring PEG 
reactivity in the ADA assay. Antigenic equivalence of the positive control (anti-Pegfilgrastim 
Mundipharma) antibody for Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and Neulasta was demonstrated at LPC and HPC 
level using a single-assay format (with labelled Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma antigen).  
All screened positive samples were tested in a confirmatory assay in the same assay format using four 
different competitive inhibitors (Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma, Neulasta, filgrastim (G-CSF) and PEG6000).

Subsequently, titer values were determined for samples that were positive in at least one of the 
confirmatory antibody assays.  
Lastly, all confirmed positive samples were tested using a neutralising assay format.

Study B12019-101 
Immunogenicity was evaluated as secondary endpoint. Subjects were dosed once with 6 mg Pegfilgrastim 
Mundipharma and once with 6 mg Neulasta. Blood samples for assessment of immunogenicity were 
obtained on Day 1 pre-dose, Days 8, 15, 22, 29 of each period and Day 43 of the last period for detection 
of ADA formation. 
Overall, 34 of 171 (19.9%) subjects in the safety population had confirmed ADA positive reactivity with 
PEG; 9 of these 34 subjects also had confirmed positive ADA reactivity with Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma; 
7 of these 34 also had confirmed positive ADA reactivity with Neulasta. Of note, some of these subjects 
had only a single positive ADA sample throughout the study. No filgrastim-reactive positive samples were 
detected in any subject treated in study B12019-101. Thus, the detected signals appear to represent 
antibodies reactive with PEG, or with the PEG moiety of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma or Neulasta. No 
samples with neutralising capacity in the cell-based assay were detected. 
Overall 6 subjects were ADA positive (positive confirmatory assay of any of the 4 specificity cut points: 
B12019, Neulasta, filgrastim or PEG 6000) already prior to dosing in Period 1. Only 1 of these subjects 
remained ADA positive throughout the study. Until the end of Period 1, 15 subjects who received Neulasta 
and 18 subjects who received B12019 had at least one ADA positive examination. One further subject was 
ADA positive until the end of Period 2 (he received Neulasta in Period 1 and B12019 in Period 2), i.e. 
overall 34 subjects had at least one positive confirmatory assay for one time point. 
The highest frequency of ADA positive subjects was on Day 15 of Period 1 (12 subjects [14%] each after 
Neulasta and B12019). Thereafter the number of ADA positive subjects decreased and on Day 43 of 
Period 2 overall only 9 subjects were ADA positive (3 subjects with the treatment sequence 
Neulasta/B12019 and 6 subjects with the treatment sequence B12019/Neulasta, all PEG-positive).

Source: Integrated summary of immunogenicity. Pooled immunogenicity analysis  
A higher incidence of confirmed PEG-reactive antibody signals was detected in Period 1 compared to 
Period 2 regardless of treatment sequence (Integrated Summary of immunogenicity). ADA titers were 
relatively low (below 20), consistent with the detection of relatively low affinity and/or low levels of 
PEG-reactive antibodies in pre- and post-treatment samples in some subjects. 
Generally, a higher incidence of PEG-reactive antibodies was observed in Period 1 compared to Period 2 
regardless of treatment sequence. An analysis of PEG positive subjects shows that there are many 
subjects who only experienced a single occurrence of PEG positive results (14 subjects). However, there 
are also many subjects who had PEG positive results for more than three consecutive time points (20 
subjects).

Figure 17:  
Individual profiles over time for subjects with at least one ADA positive time 
point 
22 out of the 34 subjects were ADA positive at least two consecutive time points; these subject profiles 
are considered more relevant compared to the profiles of the subjects with only one ADA positive time 
point. The profiles of the 22 subjects show differing patterns and do not reveal a consistent trend 
regarding the treatment or treatment sequence. In Period 1, slightly more subjects treated with 
Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma were ADA positive for at least one time point (Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma: 12 
subjects with 46 positive time points; Neulasta: 10 subjects with 39 positive time points). In Period 2, 
slightly more subjects treated with Neulasta were ADA positive for at least two timepoints (Neulasta: 8 
subjects with 29 positive timepoints; Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma: 4 subjects with 16 positive timepoints). 
Subjects 24, 30, 32, 34, 56, 137, and 158 were consistently positive at all time points from the first ADA 
positive timepoint until end of study. While subject 158 was already ADA-positive pre-treatment, all other 
subjects where ADA-negative pre-treatment. 6 subjects were consistently ADA-positive during 
treatment, being balanced across treatment sequences, with 3 subjects in the treatment sequences 
Neulasta/Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and 3 subjects in the treatment sequences Pegfilgrastim 
Mundipharma/Neulasta.

Additionally, a frequency table was generated (Table 28 ) which shows the number of ADA-positive 
subjects in Period 1 by the number of consecutive positive time points to assess the immunogenicity after 
single dosing without crossover.  
The number of subjects with at least 4 consecutive ADA-positive time points in Period 1 was balanced 
between treatments, with 6 subjects after Neulasta and 5 subjects after Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma 
dosing. 
Similar results for the 2 treatments were observed for the number of subjects with at least two 
consecutive ADA-positive time points in Period 1, with 10 subjects after Neulasta and 12 subjects after 
Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma dosing.

Study B12019-102 
In this study, the primary immunogenicity endpoint was proportion of ADA positive subjects at the end of 
Period 2, as detected by a confirmatory assay. The primary immunogenicity analysis was performed on 
the safety set, defined as all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug. For the primary 
analysis, proportions of ADA positive subjects at the end of Period 2 were calculated and presented with 
corresponding 95% CIs per treatment. Furthermore, the difference of proportions of ADA-positive 
subjects between treatments was calculated and presented with corresponding 95% CIs. 
Blood samples for determination of ADAs were collected on Days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 and 43 of each period. 
The analysis was based on 95 subjects, as one subject (020) was excluded from the analysis of ADA 
frequencies. The respective subject had received an incorrect treatment sequence that was incompatible 
with the intended study design, i.e. repeated administrations of the same treatment in Period 1 and 2. 
Two confirmed ADA positive samples were detected in Study B12019-102, both occurring at Day 15 of 
Period 1. These had a minimal ADA titer, with no filgrastim reactivity and no neutralising capacity. 
In Study B12019-102, the 3-mg dose level was chosen to correspond with a dose falling within the linear 
part of the PD response curve.

The primary PK parameters, AUC0-last and Cmax, for study B12019-101, were summarized for the 
ADA-negative and ADA-positive sub-populations (see table below). AUC0-last and Cmax were found to be 
slightly increased (8 to 18%) in the presence of antibodies.

A summary of descriptive statistics for the positive vs. negative PEG-reactive ADA subpopulations for the 
PK response are shown in the tables below.  
For the positive PEG-reactive ADA subjects, the mean Period 2 AUC/Period 1 AUC was 92.5% for the TR

Impact of ADAs on pharmacodynamics 
In Study B12019-102, only 2 subjects were ADA positive.  
In Study B12019-101, antibody formation was primarily directed against the PEG moiety. A slightly 
lowerANC response is seen in ADA positive subjects (n=34) with both the test and RP, but overall the 
mean and geometric mean values for the AUEC0-last of ANC were comparable for the ADA positive and ADA 
negative populations in each treatment group, as well as being comparable across treatment groups.

As pre-specified in the study protocol, a sensitivity analysis was conducted in the subgroup of 
ADA-negative subjects. In this subgroup (N=128), the geometric mean ratio of AUEC0-last was 100.89% 
and the corresponding 95% CI was contained in the acceptance interval of 80.00-125.00% (99.16%; 
102.65%). 
Safety in special populations 
All subjects in the conducted studies were male. No differences in AEs due to race between whites and 
non-whites have been studied. Elderly subjects were not included. Adverse event risk was analysed in the 
subgroups age, weight, BMI, smoking status, and ADA status. All subgroups were similar with regard to 
the risk for drug related TEAEs, indicating that there are no relevant differences in safety between 
subgroups. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The applicant did not submit studies relating to drug-drug interactions with Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma 
(see safety discussion). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In each study, the majority of subjects completed the study as planned (95.3% and 87.5% in Studies 
B12019-101 and B12019-102, respectively, based on the safety population). No subject discontinued 
Study B12019-101 due to an AE. In Study B12019-102, four subjects discontinued due to AEs. Two 
subjects discontinued due to increased ALT (one each after Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and Neulasta), 
one subject discontinued due to lower back pain after the second dose of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma, and 
one subject discontinued due to increased blood pressure after the first dose of Neulasta. There was no 
imbalance between treatments regarding the number of subjects with AEs leading to study 
discontinuation.

The safety population (all subjects who had received at least one dose of study drug) in Studies 
B12019-101 and B12019-102 consisted of 171 and 96 subjects, respectively. Subjects in Study 
B12019-101 were exposed to two 6 mg doses of study drug (one dose each of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma 
and Neulasta). Subjects in Study B12019-102 were exposed to three 3 mg doses of study drug (T-T-R or 
R-R-T). A total of 259 subjects received at least one dose of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma (3 mg or 6 mg); 
46 of these received two doses. A total of 260 subjects received at least one dose of Neulasta (3 mg or 6 
mg); 45 of these received two doses. Although overall safety database is limited, it can be considered 
sufficient if comparability is demonstrated in terms of PK and PD and if no unexpected AEs are found. 
Overall, the most frequent reported TEAEs were back pain (78.3%), headache (43.4%), nasopharyngitis 
(32.2%), hypoglycaemia (29.2%) and pain in extremity (21.3%). 
Generally,  the  safety  profile  was  in  both  studies  comparable  for  both  treatments  apart  from  a  few 
exceptions discussed below: 
Notably higher TEAE frequencies after Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma than after Neulasta were seen in Study 
B12019-102 for the SOCs “gastrointestinal disorders” (16.7% vs. 4.2%) and “respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders” (10.4% vs 4.2%). The imbalance in these SOCs was mainly driven by subjective 
measurable symptoms and signs such as e.g. nausea (R: 1.0% vs T: 8.3%) or cough (R: 1% vs T: 6.3%).  
The imbalances can be considered as chance findings. 
Overall, no death occurred during the two studies in healthy volunteers. A total of 4 SAEs were reported 
in two studies, but were not related to drugs studied. No subject discontinued Study B12019-101 due to 
an AE. In Study B12019-102, four subjects discontinued due to AEs. There was no imbalance between 
treatments regarding the number of subjects with AEs leading to study discontinuation. 
The majority of subjects in both studies reported at least one TEAE, and in most subjects TEAEs were 
assessed  as  related  to  study  drug.  The  frequencies  and  pattern  of  TEAEs  were  similar  between 
Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and Neulasta, and in line with the SmPC for Neulasta. 
Local tolerability was good in both studies: in the study B12019-101 two subjects (1.2%) had mild, 
self-limiting, reactions at the injection site after administration of B12019, and in the B12019-102 only 1 
subject in each treatment group had mild, self-limiting, reactions at the injection site after study drug 
administration. Overall, the results do not point to a notably higher frequency of injection site reactions 
with Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma. 
The  observed  AEs  were  generally  in  line  with  the  SmPC  for  Neulasta,  except  for  the  observed  AE 
“hypoglycaemia”.  Drug-related  hypoglycaemia  was  reported  in  around  20%  of  subjects  after 
administration  of  Pegfilgrastim  Mundipharma  and  Neulasta.  The  decrease  in  serum  glucose  was 
comparable  between  the  two  treatments.  As  hypoglycaemia  was  reversible,  not  associated  with 
symptoms,  and  did  not  require  intervention,  hypoglycaemia  can  be  considered  to  be  of  no  clinical 
relevance. 
Therefore, there were no apparent imbalances between Neulasta and Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma 
treatment regarding the number of subjects with SAEs. 
Analyses of glucose results by study period revealed no relevant differences between the two study 
periods. 
There  were  ADA-positive  subjects  with  AE  per  treatment  and  by  treatment  period  in  the  study 
B12019-101. Overall, the data are reassuring with similar AE occurring after Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma

or after Neulasta in the ADA-positive subjects. No major differences are observed. Moreover, the pattern 
of AEs in the group of confirmed ADA positive subjects (N=34) was similar to the pattern seen in the 
overall safety population (N=171). Most common were events in the SOC of musculoskeletal disorders. 
There were ADA-positive subjects with AE per treatment and by treatment period in studies B12019-101 
and  B12019-102.  Overall,  the  data  are  reassuring  with  similar  AE  occurring  after  Pegfilgrastim 
Mundipharma or after Neulasta in the ADA-positive subjects, and the AEs seen in ADA positive subjects 
were representative of AEs seen in the overall population.  
Immunogenicity 
Overall, a heterogeneous pattern of ADA-positive time points across subjects was observed. In Study 
B12019-101, about 20% had ADA-positive samples, mainly due to PEG-reactive antibody signals. No 
antibodies against filgrastim or neutralising antibodies were detected for any of the 2 treatments.  In 
Study B12019-102 two confirmed ADA positive samples were detected. These had no filgrastim reactivity 
and no neutralising capacity. No consistent trends regarding treatment or treatment sequence were 
detected. Based on the individual profiles and additional evaluations, no consistent trends towards 
longer-lasting ADA-positive subjects after Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma treatment could be observed. 
Although the immunogenicity is apparently low and no significant ADA emerged whatever the sequence 
tested in the study (Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma-Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma-Neulasta or 
Neulasta-Neulasta-Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma), formally long-term immunogenicity could not be 
assessed as the follow-up period was maximum 18 weeks and the confounding effects of a cross-over 
design.  Therefore, the proposed approach for post-marketing collection of immunogenicity data 
(collection only for individual requests from physicians and reported via the standard pharmacovigilance 
reporting lines) is considered acceptable and is agreed by PRAC. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
No unexpected safety signals were observed with Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and no death occurred 
during the two studies in healthy volunteers. 
The safety profile of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma in both studies was comparable for both treatments and 
with the safety of Neulasta. As to immunogenicity, no meaningful differences were observed across 
treatment sequences. Generally, the observed AEs were in line with the SmPC for Neulasta.  
Therefore, the safety data overall support the biosimilarity of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and RP 
EU-Neulasta.

3.  Biosimilarity assessment 
3.1.  Comparability exercise and indications claimed 
The claimed indication is identical to the RP Neulasta: “Reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the 
incidence of febrile neutropenia in adult patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy 
(with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes)”. Clinical studies 
supporting the application were carried out in healthy volunteers as part of the biosimilarity exercise. The 
clinical programme of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma comprised of two studies conducted in male healthy 
subjects.  
Clinical comparability of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and Neulasta was established in a pivotal 
pharmacokinetic (PK)/ pharmacodynamic (PD) study using the approved 6 mg dose. The study 
B12019-101 (n=172) was a single-dose, randomised, double-blind, two-stage, two-way cross-over 
study, which assessed PK and PD as co-primary endpoints.  
The supportive study B12019-102 (n=96) was a multiple-dose, randomised, double-blind, three-period, 
two-sequence crossover study to assess the immunogenicity and PD comparability of Pegfilgrastim 
Mundipharma and Neulasta using a non-therapeutic, lower dose of 3 mg.

3.2.  Results supporting biosimilarity 
Quality: 
For the biosimilarity analysis, the applicant has performed an extensive comparability exercise which 
included several batches of EU Neulasta and several batches of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma DP (including 
both process validation and clinical batches). All quality attributes analysed proved to be highly similar 
between Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and EU Neulasta. For a few purity parameters slight differences were 
observed. However, these differences were very small and are not believed to have any impact on the 
quality of the product. As such, they do not preclude a conclusion on biosimilarity. The primary structure 
of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma was found to be identical to that of the RP, with identical site of PEGylation 
for both products. Molecular weight and polydispersity indicated similar PEG moieties between 
Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and the RP. Moreover, the higher order structure, product-related variants, 
and the impurity and aggregation profiles, were also shown to be similar between Pegfilgrastim 
Mundipharma and the RP. Furthermore, relative potency and recombinant human G-CSF receptor binding 
kinetics were similar for Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and the RP. Comparative stability testing 
demonstrated that Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and the RP degrade in a comparable manner. In 
conclusion, the data of the physicochemical, bio-functional, and stability tests confirm that from a quality 
point of view Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma could be considered as biosimilar to EU Neulasta.  
Non-clinical: 
The non-clinical biosimilarity program comprised comparative assessment of in vitro PD effects as well as 
an in vivo PD/PK study. Biosimilarity of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and Neulasta was demonstrated by 
comparative assessment of the binding affinity to the G-CSF receptor as well as of the potency to 
stimulate proliferation of myeloblastic cells. The comparative PD/PK study in naïve and neutropenic rats, 
although small group sizes, is considered supportive.  
Clinical: 
Pharmacokinetics:  the  primary  and  secondary  PK  parameters  AUC0-last,  AUC0-inf  and  Cmax  were 
assessed for bioequivalence between Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and Neulasta in study B12019 101 
•  Biosimilarity  in  pharmacokinetics  of  Pegfilgrastim  Mundipharma  with  EU-authorized 
Neulasta  was  demonstrated  in  the  pivotal  PK/PD  study  B12019-101  in  healthy  male 
volunteers, as the 94.32% CIs for the ratio of the test and RP geometric means for the 
primary  and  secondary  PK  parameters  AUC0-last,  AUC0-inf  and  Cmax  were  fully 
contained within the standard BE acceptance interval of 80.00-125.00%.  
•  Study B12019-102 was not intended to evaluate PK equivalence between Pegfilgrastim 
Mundipharma and Neulasta. Although PK sampling was sparse, similar PK profiles were 
observed that can be considered as supportive for PK similarity between Pegfilgrastim 
Mundipharma and Neulasta.  
Pharmacodynamics: ANC and CD34+ were investigated in both pharmacological studies in altogether 
260 healthy volunteers (PD set) in a cross-over design.  
• 
• 
In study B12019 101 the GMR of the primary endpoint ANC AUEC0-last was 100.20%; the 
95% CI with 99.16; 102.65 was well within the acceptance interval of 80.00-125.00%. 
The secondary endpoints ANC Emax and tmax, as well as CD34+ count which were only 
presented descriptively, were comparable. 
In study B12019 102, where a lower dose of 3 mg was used in a 3 period design to assess 
immunogenicity and PD, comparability between Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and Neulasta 
was shown. The GMR of the primary endpoint ANC AUEC0-last was 101.59 with a 95% CI 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/645013/2019

of 99.58%; 103.63%. Tighter similarity limits of 90-111% were defined post-hoc, which 
were easily met as well. The descriptively presented secondary PD endpoints Emax and 
tmax as well as CD34+ cell count support biosimilarity. 
Safety: No major safety findings were detected in the clinical part of the biosimilarity program or in terms 
of immunogenicity: 
•  Safety was comparable in both studies for both treatments apart from minor differences. 
No  unexpected  safety  signals  were  observed,  and  no  death  occurred  during  the  two 
studies  in  healthy  volunteers.  The  incidence  and  severity  of  AEs  were  comparable 
between Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and Neulasta in general in the conducted studies in 
healthy volunteers. The safety profiles observed were in general in line with the Product 
Information for Neulasta. 
• 
Incidence  rates  of  ADAs  were  equally  distributed  across  treatments  and  treatment 
sequences in both studies. 
•  Across  the  two  clinical  studies,  no  confirmed  filgrastim-reactive  ADAs  or  neutralising 
antibodies were observed. 
•  Subjects  classified  as  ADA-positive  showed  no  meaningful  differences  in  PD  or  AE  as 
compared to ADA-negative subjects. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about biosimilarity 
There are no remaining uncertainties and limitations that have an impact on the conclusion of 
biosimilarity of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and Neulasta. 
3.4.    Discussion on biosimilarity 
For a biosimilar, the benefit-risk balance is derived from the RP provided the totality of evidence collected 
from the quality, non-clinical and clinical data package that support the comparability of both products. 
From a quality perspective, the critical physico-chemical and functional attributes have demonstrated 
that Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma is highly similar to its RP EU Neulasta. A few minor differences were 
observed, but these are negligible and have no impact on the quality of the product or on the conclusion 
of biosimilarity (at quality level).  
From a non-clinical perspective, the requirements for biosimilarity assessment have been met and 
sufficient evidence for the demonstration of biosimilarity has been provided.  
The clinical biosimilarity program consisted of comparative PK, PD, immunogenicity and safety analyses 
in healthy male volunteers. The studies included only healthy volunteers, which are considered a 
homogenous and sensitive population to assess the primary objectives of the clinical studies and were in 
agreement with the scientific advice provided. Biosimilarity between Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma and the 
RP Neulasta was demonstrated in the clinical studies, as the primary PK and PD endpoints GMR of 
AUC0-last, Cmax and ANC AUEC0-last including their confidence intervals met the acceptance criteria. The 
secondary endpoints are also supportive of the biosimilarity exercise.  
The safety of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma was consider similar to Neulasta in both studies, no unexpected 
safety signals were reported and the incidence rates of ADAs were equally distributed across treatments 
and treatment sequences in both studies. 
Therefore, considering the totality of the evidence on the quality, non-clinical and clinical data, 
biosimilarity of Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma with the RP EU Neulasta can be concluded.

3.5.  Extrapolation of safety and efficacy 
The claimed indication is the only indication currently approved for EU-Neulasta (“Reduction in the 
duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in adult patients treated with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy for malignancy [with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic 
syndromes”]).  
Therefore, no extrapolation to other indications is needed for this biosimilar application. 
3.6.  Conclusions on biosimilarity and benefit risk balance 
Based on the review of the submitted data, Pegfilgrastim Mundipharma is considered biosimilar to 
Neulasta. Therefore, a benefit/risk balance comparable to the RP can be concluded. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome

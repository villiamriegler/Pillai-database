On  8  October  1996,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  holder  (MAH)  submitted  two  different 
applications  for  a  Type  I  variation  in  accordance  with  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  
No. 542/95: 
1. 
2. 
The scope of the first variation related to the introduction of a new manufacturing site as 
an alternative manufacturer of the active substance. 
The  scope  of  the  second  variation  related  to  the  change  of  the  batch  size  of  the  active 
substance. 
On 30 October 1996, the EMEA considered both variations to be acceptable. These variations 
did not require any amendments to the Commission Decision. 
On 19 November 1996, the MAH submitted an application for a Type I variation in accordance 
with  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No.  542/95,  related  to  a  change  of  the  name  of  the 
manufacturer  of  the  finished  medicinal  product  and  responsible  for  the  batch  release  in  the 
European Economic Area for Epivir oral solution. On 2 December 1996, the EMEA approved 
the  variation,  which  required  amendments  to  be  incorporated  in  the  relevant  sections  of  the 
Commission Decision. The European Commission amended the Decision on 14 February 1997. 
On  28  November  1996,  the  MAH  submitted  two  applications  for  a  Type  II  variation  in 
accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 542/95: 
1. 
2. 
The scope of the first variation concerned the introduction of a 10 ml device syringe and a 
polyethylene adapter in each oral solution pack to facilitate its use. The CPMP considered 
the variation acceptable and adopted the Opinion on the Type II variation on 22 January 
1997. The respective Commission Decision was issued on 15 April 1997. 
The scope of second variation concerned the update of the statement into the Summary of 
Product  Characteristics  related  to  the  carcinogenicity  and  mutagenicity  potential 
following  the  finalisation  of  the  studies.  The  CPMP  agreed  on  the  wording  to  be 
implemented  into  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  and  adopted  the  Opinion  on 
the  Type  II  variation  on  19  February  1997.  The  respective  Commission  Decision  was 
issued on 22 May 1997. 
On 23 January 1997, the MAH submitted two applications for a Type I variation in accordance 
with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 542/95, related to a change in the manufacturer(s) of the 
active  substance.  On  28  February  1997,  the  EMEA  approved  both  variations,  which  did  not 
require any amendments to the Commission Decision. 
On 1 April 1997, the MAH submitted an application for a Type I variation in accordance with 
Commission Regulation (EC) No. 542/95, related to a change in the manufacturer of the active 
substance.  On  15  May  1997,  the  EMEA  approved  the  variation,  which  did  not  require  any 
amendments to the Commission Decision. 
On 23 June 1997, the MAH submitted an application for a Type I variation in accordance with 
Commission Regulation (EC) No. 542/95, related to a minor modification to the synthesis of the 
active substance. On 11 July 1997, the EMEA approved the variation, which did not require any 
amendments to the Commission Decision. 
Pursuant  to  Article  13(2)  of  Council  Regulation  (EEC)  No  2309/93  and  Part  4G  of  Annex  to 
Council  Directive  75/318/EEC,  the  MAH  provided  throughout  1997  additional  efficacy  and 
safety data as stated in the Annex IIC to the Commission Decision, which formed the basis of 
the annual re-assessment of the risk/benefit profile of Epivir (e.g. final results from the clinical 
endpoint study). On 14 July 1997 the MAH provided an updated expert report summarising the 
different specific obligations already submitted within the period August 1996-June 1997. The 
procedure  started  on  25  July  1997.  During  its  September  plenary  CPMP  meeting,  the  CPMP 
agreed  with  the  Rapporteur’s  assessment  report  that  the  risk/benefit  profile  of  lamivudine 
remained  favourable  and  that  there  was  no  remaining  grounds  to  keep  the  MA  under

exceptional circumstances since all the specific obligations were fulfilled. The CPMP adopted 
on 24 September 1997, an Opinion on the annual re-assessment of the specific obligations and 
the  benefit/risk  ratio,  stating  that  amendments  of  Annexes  I,  II  and  III  to  the  Community 
Marketing  Authorisation  were  necessary.  The  respective  Commission  Decision  was  issued  on 
7 January  1998.  Subsequent  applications  for  a  Type  II  variation  (update  of  the  Summary  of 
Product  Characteristics and change in the formulation of the oral  solution) were  submitted  by 
the  MAH  and  Opinions  were  adopted  by  the  CPMP  on  24  September  1997.  The  respective 
Commission Decisions were issued on 16 December 1997.

with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 542/95: 
1. 
2. 
The  scope  of  the  first  variation  concerned  the  extension  of  the  indication  to  include 
paediatric patients.

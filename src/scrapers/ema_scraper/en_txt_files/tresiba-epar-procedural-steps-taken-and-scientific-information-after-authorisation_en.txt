clinical data from the pregnancy trial EXPECT 
conducted for Tresiba. This was a multi-centre, 
randomised, active controlled trial comparing the 
efficacy and safety of Tresiba once daily with insulin 
detemir once or twice daily both in combination with 
insulin aspart 2-4 times daily with meals in pregnant 
women or women who intended to become pregnant, 
all with type 1 diabetes. 
The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. In 
addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce 
minor administrative changes. The RMP version 9.0 
is also submitted. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

data 
with Tresiba during pregnancy was non-inferior to that of 
the comparator. The safety profile with regards to 
hypoglycaemia was in line with previous data for Tresiba. 
There were differences noted regarding maternal safety, as 
reflected in SmPC section 5.1. No new safety concerns 
arose with regards to maternal or foetal/infant health.

DEVOTE was a randomised, double-blind and event-

versus insulin glargine (100 units/mL) in patients 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus at high risk of

SmPC, Annex 
Data from the following two studies were submitted 
Tresiba in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity. 
Grouping of two variations to update sections 4.2 
and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to include updated 
information on the use of Tresiba in terms of transfer 
from other basal insulin regimens and the effects of 
Tresiba on hypoglycaemia. 
The Package Leaflet and Labelling are proposed to be 
updated accordingly. 
An updated RMP (version 7.0) was submitted with 
this procedure. 
The proposed changes reflect the findings from two 
studies submitted: NN1250-3995 (SWITCH 1) and 
NN1250-3998 (SWITCH 2), comparing the safety and 
efficacy of Tresiba and insulin glargine U-100, mainly 
to document the hypoglycaemia profile in type 1 
diabetes and type 2 diabetes, respectively. 
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder 
(MAH) took the opportunity to bring the PI in line 
with the latest QRD template version 10.0 and 
implement minor changes to the SmPC section 4.2 
and the corresponding section of the Package Leaflet 
to clarify the correct use of Tresiba. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
II, Labelling 
conducted for insulin degludec: NN1250-3995 (SWITCH 1) 
and PL 
and NN1250-3998 (SWITCH 2). The trials were identically 
designed to compare the safety and efficacy of insulin 
degludec and insulin glargine U-100. The main objective of 
the trials was to document the hypoglycaemia profile in 
type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, respectively. 
The prescribing information for Tresiba was updated with 
new information on the use of insulin degludec in terms of 
transfer from other basal insulin regimens and the 
hypoglycaemia benefit of Tresiba.  
The findings from the two trials were included in section 4.2 
(Transfer from other insulin medicinal products) and 
section 5.1 (Clinical efficacy and safety) of the SmPC. Minor 
changes were also made to the SmPC section 4.2 and the 
corresponding section of the PL to clarify the correct use of 
insulin degludec.

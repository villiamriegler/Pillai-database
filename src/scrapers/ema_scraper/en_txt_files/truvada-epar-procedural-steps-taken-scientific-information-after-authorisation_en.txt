Submission of the final report from study GS-EU-
104-0433, listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. 
This is an observational, drug utilisation study (DUS) 
of Viread in children and adolescents with HIV-1 
infection, in fulfilment of a post-authorisation 
measure (PAM) for Viread (MEA 46) and Truvada 
(MEA 276). 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
information on the effectiveness of risk minimization 
measures for paediatric patients, i.e. the current 
recommendations stated in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) as regards the need of renal 
function monitoring and the educational brochures 
distributed to Healthcare providers (HCP) specialized in the 
management of HIV-1 infected paediatric patients. 
The final results of this DUS in HIV-1 infected children show 
a low adherence to the renal monitoring recommendations. 
The dissemination of a new educational brochure to 
physicians of paediatric HIV-infected patients would be of 
limited impact, following the recent redistribution of 
paediatric educational brochures at the end of 2017 for the 
extension of Truvada indication in HIV-1 infected 
adolescents. Furthermore, it is anticipated that the use of 
Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF) as part of 
antiretroviral regimens in children and adolescent will 
ultimately be replaced by tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)-
containing regimens for which a lesser impact on bone and 
renal function is expected. 
Furthermore, the results of this DUS suggest that there 
Page 11/49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were minimal renal or bone safety adverse events across 
all evaluated laboratory measures observed with the 
Viread/TDF-Fixed Dose Combinations treatment groups and 
patients generally recovered within a few weeks of the 
adverse event; reflecting that population of HIV infected 
children and adolescents is kept under close scrutiny by 
paediatricians with frequent visits in clinical practice.

GS-US-276-0101 is a prospective, observational 
study of pregnancy outcomes among women 
exposed to Truvada for pre-exposure prophylaxis 
nested in the antiretroviral pregnancy registry. 
GS-US-276-0105 is a prospective, observational,

pre-exposure prophylaxis in the USA. 
information safety in pregnancy showed that there were no 
statistically significant differences in adverse pregnancy 
outcomes of abortion and birth defects between the pre-
exposure prophylaxis group and the treatment group. The 
current SmPC wording adequately describes 
recommendations for use of Truvada in pregnancy. 
Results from study GS-US-276-0105 to identify risks of 
HIV-1 acquisition including infection resulting from non-
adherence and development of resistance in patients with 
unrecognised or acute infection showed that the majority of 
users (67.8%) were >80% adherent to the pre-exposure 
prophylaxis  regimen and overall seroconversion rate was 
Page 12/49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
low (less than 1% annually). The current SmPC wording 
sufficiently describes the warnings and precautions 
associated with adherence to preexposure prophylaxis of 
HIV-1 infection and the risk of resistance.

and dolutegavir  based on  new clinical pharmacology 
data from study GS-US-377-1501. This is a Phase 1,

between Harvoni (ledipasvir [LDV]/sofosbuvir [SOF]) 
and FTC/TDF+dolutegravir (DTG). 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

tenofovir (TFV; the metabolite of TDF) was observed 
following coadministration of Harvoni and FTC/TDF+DTG, 
compared with FTC/TDF+DTG alone. The overall tenofovir 
exposures observed in this study were in the range of those 
observed when TDF is administered as part of a boosted 
regimen notably. No clinically significant drug interactions 
were observed between emtricitabine or dolutegravir and 
Harvoni. Accordingly, Truvada and Viread can be 
coadministered with Harvoni without dose adjustment but 
with close monitoring of renal function as the increased 
exposure of tenofovir could potentiate adverse reactions 
associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, including 
renal disorders.  Renal function should be closely 
monitored.

no dose adjustment is recommended.  The increased 
exposure of tenofovir could potentiate adverse reactions 
associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, including 
renal disorders.  Renal function should be closely 
monitored.

As regards bone fractures, 8 events were reported during 
the study. All of them were trauma-related, not considered 
related to tenofovir or Truvada and were recovered.  
As regards the renal function, the median change in 
eGFRCG seems not clinically relevant (with no subjects 
experiencing eGFRCG below 50 mL/min) and glomerular 
function remained stable through study. 
No Fanconi syndrome or tubulopathy was reported. The 
only renal SAE reported was kidney pain which was not 
related to study drug.  
No new safety concern was raised from these final study 
results.  No change to the SmPC of TDF-containing 
products is therefore necessary on the basis of these data.

Emtriva, Eviplera, Stribild, Truvada, Viread and 
Vitekta to revise the wording regarding the risk of 
sexual transmission of HIV infection following CHMP 
request adopted in December 2013. The PL has been 
updated accordingly. Furthermore, the MAH took the 
opportunity of this worksharing to update the PL with

exceedingly low. A position statement on the use of 
antiretroviral therapy to reduce HIV transmission was 
published by the British HIV Association (BHIVA) in January 
2013. As a consequence, the recommendations for post-
exposure prophylaxis have also been changed in recently 
updated HIV treatment guidelines. For example, the 2013 
BHIVA guideline does not generally recommend post-
exposure prophylaxis (PEP) after exposure from a patient 
with well treated HIV. Based on these data, the wording on 
the risk of transmission for HIV products was revised to 
reflect the current scientific knowledge. While effective 
suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to 
substantially reduce the risk of sexual transmission, a 
residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent

with different degrees of renal impairment is now reflected 
in section 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2 of the SPC. This study, which 
enrolled only 8 patients with varying degrees of renal 
impairment, supports the existing advice that no dose 
adjustment to the normal once daily dosing is required in 
patients with mild renal impairment. However, very careful 
consideration and benefit risk assessment is needed in all 
patients with Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) <60 ml/min. The 
limited data available indicate that in patients with 
borderline CrCl (close to 50 ml/min), current dosing 
recommendation of one tablet in every 24 h resulted in 2- 
to 4-fold increase in tenofovir exposure which was 
accompanied by decreased renal function and

Explanatory text was added in section 4.8 to indicate that 
the adverse reactions of rhabdomyolysis, osteomalacia, 
hypokalaemia, muscular weakness, myopathy, and 
hypophosphatemia may occur as a consequence of 
proximal renal tubulopathy and that these events are not

Update of sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC with 144 
week efficacy, safety and resistance data of study 
GS-01-934 in HIV-1 infected antiretroviral naïve 
patients comparing emtricitabine, tenofovir DF in 
combination with efavirenz versus with

proportion of subjects in the emtricitabine + tenofovir DF 
group (71%) compared with the lamivudine/zidovudine 
group (58%) achieved and maintained plasma HIV-1 RNA 
< 400 copies/ml. The corresponding percentages for HIV 1 
RNA < 50 copies/ml were not statistically significantly 
different between the groups.   
The 144 week resistance analysis showed that mutations 
associated with resistance to efavirenz (predominantly 
K103N) or with resistance to emtricitabine or lamivudine 
(M184V/I) occurred less often in the emtricitabine + 
tenofovir group than in the lamivudine/zidovudine group. It 
is notable that no subject developed the K65R mutation 
that can be selected by tenofovir. 
In relation to co-infected HIV-1/HBV patients, no 
conclusions can be drawn regarding the potential efficacy of 
emtricitabine/tenofovir DF and its relative efficacy vs 
lamivudine in controlling HBV replication based on the 
limited number of co-infected patients in this study (n=13 
with a mixture of HBeAg+ and HBeAg-). 
The long term safety data in antiretroviral naïve patients 
are reassuring as regards the safety profile of the combined 
use of emtricitabine + tenofovir DF. There appeared to be 
less nausea and anaemia with this regimen then with 
lamivudine/zidovudine.

No new signal has emerged concerning any higher risk of 
fractures, skin hyperpigmentation and renal toxicity. 
Treatment was discontinued in 5% in the emtricitabine + 
tenofovir DF group due to treatment-emergent adverse 
events and 11% in the lamivudine/zidovudine group.  
Smaller increases in fasting serum triglycerides and total 
cholesterol levels occurred in the emtricitabine/tenofovir DF 
group compared with the lamivudine/zidovudine group. The 
emtricitabine/tenofovir group demonstrated a preferential 
effect on lipid metabolism and limb fat compared to 
lamivudine/zidovudine.

from clinical trials suggested that emtricitabine can cause 
anaemia, in between 0.5 and 1.0% of patients. Based on 
these findings, "anaemia" was included in the Emtriva 
product information as an uncommon adverse reaction to 
emtricitabine treatment in adult patients, in a variation 
approved in August 2007. For consistency, "anaemia" is 
now also being added in the Truvada product information 
as an uncommon adverse reaction. In addition, results from 
a pharmacokinetic study did not show any clinically 
relevant drug-drug interactions between Truvada and 
tacrolimus. This information has been included in the SPC.

concerning patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance 50-80 ml/min), limited available data from three 
clinical studies have not indicated that the safety and 
efficacy profile of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is different 
to the profile in patients with normal renal function. These 
limited data tend to support the existing advice that no 
dosing adjustment to the normal once daily dosing is 
required in patients with mild renal impairment. This 
information was reflected in section 4.2 of the SPC. Section 
4.4 of the SPC was also updated with renal safety 
information concerning possible renal adverse events and 
the need to assess the potential benefit of tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate therapy in patients with moderate renal 
impairment against the potential risk of renal toxicity.

tenofovir was already associated with osteomalacia in 
monkeys. Osteomalacia was recognised as an adverse 
reaction to tenofovir treatment but for which the frequency 
is currently not known. The muscle events in cases of 
possible fanconi syndrome were also reviewed: in 8 of the 
15 cases describing muscle events, a positive dechallenge 
with clear improvement of the muscle symptoms was 
described. Myopathy is therefore an adverse reaction to 
tenofovir treatment for which the frequency is currently not 
known. A cumulative review of renal disorders lead to the 
inclusion of acute interstitial nephritis as an adverse 
reaction to tenofovir treatment. Section 4.8 of the SPC and

whether the combination treatment (emtricitabine/tenofovir

tenofovir DF alone revealed that the presence of 
emtricitabine did not enhance the toxicity of tenofovir DF. 
No exacerbation of the toxicological effects was found 
compared to the separate components.   
The mutagenicity of emtricitabine was previously found to 
be negative in a range of mutagenicity tests whilst 
tenofovir DF was positive in a number of in vitro 
genotoxicity assays. The two in vitro studies performed 
with combination emtricitabine/tenofovir DF which were 
assessed by the CHMP in June 2005 showed that Truvada 
displays mutagenicity in a mammalian mutagenesis assay

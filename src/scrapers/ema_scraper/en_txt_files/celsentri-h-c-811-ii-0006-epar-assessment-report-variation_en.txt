Introduction 
Maraviroc is a member of a therapeutic class called CCR5 antagonists, which selectively binds to the 
human  chemokine  receptor  CCR5,  preventing  CCR5-tropic  HIV-1  from  entering  cells.  It  has  been 
shown active in vitro against a wide range of clade B and non clade B clinical isolates, including those 
resistant to existing drug classes. Maraviroc has no antiviral activity in vitro against viruses which can 
use CXCR4 as their entry co-receptor (dual-tropic or CXCR4-tropic viruses).  
Celsentri  (maraviroc),  film-coated  tablets  is  appproved  since  September  2007,  in  combination  with 
other  antiretroviral  medicinal  products,  for  treatment-experienced  adult  patients  infected  with  only 
CCR5-tropic  HIV-1  detectable.  The  recommended  daily  dose  is  150  mg,  300 mg  or  600  mg  twice 
daily  depending  on  interactions  with  co-administered  antiretroviral  therapy  and  other  medicinal 
products. 
Data  from  two  phase  II  dose-ranging  studies  for  dose-selection,  (A40010071,  A40010152)  assessed 
during  the  MAA  and  data  from  a  retrospective  study  of  two  large  antiretroviral-naïve  cohorts3,4, 
showed  a  high  percentage  of  treatment-naïve  patients  infected  only  with  CCR5-tropic  HIV-1.  The 
potential  benefit  of  a  CCR5  antagonist  as  HAART  component  for  treatment-naïve  patients  was 
therefore evaluated in study A4001026, a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, comparative trial of 
a novel CCR5 antagonist, maraviroc, in combination with zidovudine/lamivudine versus efavirenz in 
combination  with  zidovudine/lamivudine  for  the  treatment  of  antiretroviral  naïve  HIV-1  infected 
subjects. 
Based on the results of 96 week data for study A4001026, the MAH applied for an extension of the 
therapeutic  indication  of  Celsentri  to  include  treatment-naïve  CCR5-tropic  HIV-1  infected  adult 
patients in the present type II variation.  
Non-clinical aspects 
Environmental risk assessment (ERA) 
An  updated  ecotoxicology/environmental  risk  assessment  according  to  the  current  applicable 
guidelines was provided.  
In  Phase  I  a  worst-case  PEC  in  surface  water  of  3.0µg/l  was  calculated.  This  was  higher  than  the 
action limit of 0.01µg/l and a Phase II environmental fate and effects analysis was performed.  
The  phase  II  analysis  did  not  indicate  any  environmental  concern  with  the  use  of  maraviroc  at 
maximum daily dose of 600 mg.  
In order to enhance environmental protection even for medicinal products that do not require special 
disposal  measures,  section  6.6  of  the  SPC  for  Celsentri  was  amended  to  reflect  the  recommended 
standard statement. 
1 A randomised, double blind, placebo, controlled, multicentre study of maraviroc 25 mg QD, 50 mg BID, 100 mg BID and 300 mg BID in 
asymptomatic HIV infected patients to investigate pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, safety and toleration. 
2 An investigation into the effects of food and dose regimen on viral load response in HIV infected patients on short term monotherapy with 
maraviroc.

Clinical aspects 
The  clinical  development  of  maraviroc  in  treatment-naïve  adult  patients  infected  with  CCR5-tropic 
HIV-1  consisted  in  one  phase  III,  randomised,  double-blinded,  comparative  study  (A4001026)  of 
maraviroc at two different doses versus efavirenz, each in combination with zidovudine /lamivudine.  
The 96 week results of this study were submitted in this variation application. 
Clinical efficacy 
Study A4001026 (MERIT study) 
A  phase  III,  multicentre,  randomised  (1:1:1),  double-blinded  study  comparing  maraviroc  at  two 
different doses (300 mg QD, 300 mg BID) versus efavirenz (600 mg QD), each in combination with 
zidovudine 300mg/lamivudine 150 mg (BID, Combivir) in treatment-naïve adult patients infected with 
CCR5-tropic HIV-1 following 96 weeks. 
There was an interim analysis at week 16, a primary efficacy analysis at week 48 and a final analysis 
at week 96.  
Study Population 
Male and female subjects, ≥16 years of age (not pregnant), infected with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 with a 
viral  load  ≥2000  copies/ml  at  screening.  The  subjects  could  not  have  received  any  antiretroviral 
therapy for more than 14 days and could not have an active or recent (previous 30 days) opportunistic 
infection or a suspected primary HIV-1 infection. All subjects underwent genotypic and/or phenotypic 
testing for the presence of CCR5-tropic HIV-1 prior to the first dose of study drug.  
Study Treatments 
Subjects were randomised to receive one of the following double-blinded treatments: 
•  Maraviroc 300 mg QD + lamivudine 150 mg/zidovudine 300 mg BID, 
•  Maraviroc 300 mg BID + lamivudine 150 mg/zidovudine 300 mg BID or, 
•  Efavirenz 600 mg QD + lamivudine 150 mg/zidovudine 300 mg BID. 
Following  the  interim  analysis  at  week  16,  the  maraviroc  300  mg  QD  treatment  group  was 
discontinued  (09  January  2006)  due  to  the  pre-specified  criteria  for  non-inferiority  to  efavirenz  not 
being  met.  Subjects  on  this  treatment  group  were  assessed  for  eligibility  to  receive  open  label 
maraviroc 300 mg BID based on safety criteria and virologic response. Hence, week 16 onwards there 
were two maraviroc 300 mg BID treatment groups: a double-blinded and an open-labeled. 
Study Objectives 
The primary objective was to assess whether the antiviral activity (i.e. plasma viral load <400 and <50 
copies/ml at week 48), of each of two doses of maraviroc in combination with zidovudine/lamivudine 
was  non-inferior  to  a  reference  regimen  of  efavirenz  plus  zidovudine/lamivudine  in  antiretroviral-
naïve, CCR5 tropic HIV-1 infected subjects. 
The secondary objectives were: 
• to assess whether the antiviral activity (i.e. plasma viral load <400 and <50 copies/ml at week 24 and 
at week 96), of each of two doses of maraviroc in combination with zidovudine/lamivudine was non-
inferior  to  a  reference  regimen  of  efavirenz  plus  zidovudine/lamivudine  in  antiretroviral-naïve, 
CCR5 tropic HIV-1 infected subjects; 
• to compare the TLOVR through weeks 48 and 96 for each of the two maraviroc regimens versus the 
efavirenz regimen; 
• to compare the reduction of plasma log10 viral load from baseline through weeks 24, 48 and 96 for 
each of the two maraviroc regimens versus the efavirenz regimen; 
Page 3 of 13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• to compare the differences in the magnitude of changes in cluster of differentiation 4 receptor (CD4) 
and 8 (CD8) cell counts from baseline through weeks 24, 48 and 96 for each of the two maraviroc 
regimens versus the efavirenz regimen; 
•  to  compare  the  TAD  in  log10  viral  load  at  weeks  24,  48  and  96  for  each  of  the  two  maraviroc 
regimens versus the efavirenz regimen; 
• to assess HIV-1 genotype and phenotype at the time of failure; 
• to assess HIV-1 tropism at baseline and at the time of failure;  
•  to  compare  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  each  of  the  two  maraviroc  regimens versus  the  efavirenz 
regimen. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy  analyses  at  week  96  were  considered  secondary  to  the  primary  analysis  at  week  48.  The 
analyses were performed on the full analysis set (FAS5) and per protocol (PP6) populations comparing 
maraviroc 300 mg BID and efavirenz 600 mg QD for each endpoint.  
The principal endpoint was the percentage of subjects with undetectable viral load at week 96 by the 
standard  and  more  sensitive  methods  (<400  copies/ml  and  <50  copies/ml,  respectively).  The 
difference in the percentage of subjects with the specified response was assessed by using a 1-sided 
97.5% confidence interval (CI; adjusted for the randomisation strata) and calculated for the difference 
between maraviroc 300 mg BID and efavirenz 600 mg QD. If the lower bound of the CI was above -
10%, non-inferiority between maraviroc 300 mg BID and efavirenz 600 mg QD could be concluded.  
The CHMP noted that this study, analogous to an adaptive design with dose (regimen) selection at the 
interim analysis, has the potential to inflate type I error and interference should have been based on 
adjusted  confidence  intervals.  A  97.5%  two-sided  interval  would  have  been  appropriate.  The  MAH 
used  a  1-sided  98.75%  (equivalent  to  a  97.5%  two-sided  confidence  limit)  in  a  secondary  analysis 
performed  for  illustrative  purposes  as  per  study  protocol.  A  comparison  of  results  obtained  for  the 
primary endpoint and for TLOVR using lower bound of the 1-sided 97.5% CI and 1-sided 98.75% was 
presented.  
Results 
The original Trofile assay (Monogram Biosciences) was used in this study. An enhanced sensitivity 
Trofile assay with an increased sensitivity for detection of CXCR4-tropic virus was in the meantime 
available.  The  results  for  study  A4001026  were  obtained  using  the  original  Trofile  assay  but  a 
retrospective re-analysis of the results using the enhanced sensitivity Trofile assay was performed.  
All data presented concerns the double-blind treatment group of maraviroc 300 mg BID and efavirenz 
600 mg QD.  
Patients’ disposition 
Of the 1730 subjects planned for enrollment, 917 were randomised:  
•  360 to receive maraviroc 300 mg BID; 
•  361 to receive efavirenz 600 mg QD; 
•  174 to receive maraviroc 300 mg QD;  
•  22 were randomised but have not received any study medication.   
5 FAS analysis set: included all randomised subjects who received at least 1 dose of study medication. 
6 PP analysis set: included all randomised subjects who received at least 1 dose of study medication (FAS) for at least 14 days, were more 
than 80% compliant and did not had any protocol violation (as per protocol-defined including patients who switched to CXCR4 positive viral 
tropism from screening to baseline).

Overall,  there  was  a  high  discontinuation  rate  similar  in  both  treatment  groups.  However,  in  the 
maraviroc group due to lack of efficacy, while in the efavirenz group due to efavirenz-related adverse 
events. The high rate of discontinuations observed in the efavirenz group at week 96 (34.1%) is similar 
to the rate reported in other treatment naïve studies with efavirenz + zidovudine/lamivudine regimens.  
Demographic and baseline characteristics 
There were no significant differences between the maraviroc 300 mg BID group and efavirenz 600 mg 
QD group. A high proportion of females (29% maraviroc group and 28% efavirenz group) and black 
patients (34.2% maraviroc group and 36.8 % efavirenz group) was noted.

The established difference in response rates of -10% for non-inferiority was not met.   
The  results  obtained  with  efavirenz  are  similar  to  those  seen  in  other  studies  of  efavirenz  where 
lamivudine/zidovudine was used as a backbone (70-75% of patients < 50 copies/ml after 48 weeks of 
treatment). Maraviroc efficacy was affected by baseline viral load (10% difference between those with 
viral load < and > 100.000 copies/ml).  
Similar results were observed for subjects with viral loads of <400 copies/ml or <50 copies/ml using 
the  PP  –  As  Treated  population.  These  results  are  qualitatively  similar  to  the  previously  reported 
primary  analyses  at  week  48  (slightly  higher  -  5%  proportions  of  patients  with  viral  load  <400  and  
<50 cps/ml than in the FAS- AT population in both treatment groups). The analysis of the difference 
in percentage using this population did not meet the pre-defined criteria for non-inferiority, as well.

Time to Loss of Virologic Response (TLOVR) 
The results, using the TLOVR algorithm for subjects with a viral load of <400 copies/ml, showed that 
the lower confidence bound of the 1-sided 97.5% CI was -9.7% for the FAS - As Treated population. 
These results are similar to those reported for the FAS - As Treated population at week 48 (the 1-sided 
97.5% CI was above -10%).  
However, for subjects with a viral load of <400 copies/ml in the PP – As Treated population, and for 
subjects with a viral load of <50 copies/ml in the FAS – As Treated and PP –As Treated populations 
the  results  showed  that  the  lower  confidence  bound  of  the  1-sided  97.5%  CI  for  each  analysis  was 
below -10%.  
Overall,  the  analysis  using  the  TLOVR  algorithm  is  consistent  with  a  significant  loss  of  efficacy  at 
week 48 for the maraviroc group, maintained until week 96.

There is a benefit in favour of maraviroc for the difference in CD4 cell count and CD8 cell count at 
week 96 between the maraviroc 300 mg BID and efavirenz 600 mg QD treatment groups. Based on 
current available data it is not clear if the difference would translate into a clinical benefit.  
Results of sub group analyses 
Poorer response rates were observed for maraviroc in black subjects, in southern hemisphere patients, 
in patients with subtype C virus and in female subjects.  
This  may  indicate  that  maraviroc  performs  less  well  in  patients  with  non-B  subtypes  (prevalent  in 
treatment-naïve  patients  in  Europe). This  could  also be  related  with the Trofile  assay,  since  23%  of 
those with subtype C had non-reportable viral tropism at screening, as compared to 6% of those with 
subtype B. This issue is undergoing discussions on improvement by modifying primers.  
The  above  findings  could  also  point  to  a  significant  impact  of  genetic  determinants  in  terms  of 
response. Further clarifications were provided by the MAH on the overall impact of genetic variability 
and the relationship between exposure and response to treatment. Including a number of summaries on 
simulations  (modulations  where  the  300  mg  dose  is  justified  as  adequate)  to  address  the  CHMP 
presumption that the 300 mg BID dose (in combination with two NRTIs) used in this study might have 
been too low. The CHMP noted that in one analysis, the number of patients with < 400 copies/ml at 
week  48  would  increase  around  6%,  according  to  the  simulation  (70=>76%),  when  the  dose  was 
increased from 300 to 450 mg BID. Neither race nor clades were identified as prognostic factors in the 
model for study A4001026.

Hence, the majority of those failing with maraviroc, still had CCR5-tropic virus at time of treatment 
failure. The impact of the switch in the clinical outcome in treatment naïve patients including risk for 
disease progression and the potential for reversion to the previous CCR5 tropism was further discussed 
by the MAH per CHMP request.  
At week 96, 12 subjects (28%) with CCR5 tropism at baseline failed with CXCR4-using virus.  
Considering the mean increases in CD4+ cell count from baseline to time of failure in the maraviroc 
group  including  in  subjects  who  had  CCR5  tropic  virus  at  baseline  and  failed  with  CXCR4-using 
virus; and the slightly lower incidence of CDC category C infection and malignancy events in subjects 
receiving  maraviroc,  it  seems  that  there  is  no  adverse  immunological  outcome  in  subjects  failing 
maraviroc with CXCR4-using virus.  
Available data from the study off drug (ISOD) with maraviroc shows that the majority of subjects with 
CCR5 at baseline failing with CXCR4-using virus reverted back to CCR5-tropism. This reversion is 
consistent with data obtained in treatment-experienced patients. 
Based  on the  current  available data  it  is  agreed  that the  impact  of  the tropism  switch in the clinical 
outcome does not constitute a concern. The MAH committed to follow-up this issue in the 5 years data 
from study A4001026 (see Letter of Undertaking attached to this report). 
Re-analysis of efficacy results using the enhanced Trofile assay 
Data  from  in  vitro  mixing  experiments  showed  that  an  enhanced  Trofile  assay  detected  CXCR4 
variants 100% of the time when they comprised 0.3% of the total viral population as opposed to 10% 
with the original Trofile assay. 
Of  the  721  subjects  randomised  to  maraviroc  300  mg  BID  (n=360)  and  to  efavirenz  600  mg  QD 
(n=361) and classified as CCR5-tropic at screening by the original Trofile assay, 106 (14.7%) were re-
classified as dual mixed/CXCR4-tropism by the enhanced Trofile [48 (13.3%) and 58 (16.1%) in the 
maraviroc and efavirenz groups, respectively].  
The  number  of  treatment  naïve  patients  that  were  not  eligible  for  maraviroc  therapy  due  to  the 
presence of CXCR4-virus following re-analysis is significant.

Similar  findings  were  observed  in  the  PP-AT  population.  The  lower  confidence  bound  for  <50 
copies/ml at week 48 decreased from -10.9 to -7.4 with one-sided 97.5% lower confidence interval and 
from -11.9 to -8.4 with one-sided 98.75% lower confidence interval. This retrospective analysis, using 
a new method and without further data to support the revised results is considered not valid and not 
sufficient for consideration to the applied extension of the therapeutic indication. 
Re-analysis of virology results at week 96 using the enhanced Trofile assay  
The  analysis  consisted  of  responders  and  virologic  failures  as  defined  using  the  time  to  loss  of 
virologic  failure  algorithm  with  a  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  cut-off  of  50  copies/ml  (TLOVR50).  Those 
discontinuing the study for other, non-virologic reasons were omitted from this analysis. This resulted 
in a total population of 253 in the maraviroc group and 220 in the efavirenz group. 
There  were  similar  numbers  of  responders  in  both  groups  (maraviroc  n=188/253;  efavirenz: 
n=184/220). In the maraviroc group there was a higher number of subjects who experienced virologic 
failure (maraviroc: n=65/253; efavirenz: n=36/220). Most subjects who experienced virological failure 
with CCR5-tropic virus had CXCR4-using virus at time of failure as shown in the following table.

As seen, and as with the original Trofile assay, the majority of patients failing with maraviroc, still had 
CCR5-tropic  virus,  and  with  CCR5-tropic  virus  still sensitive  to  maraviroc  in  vitro  (27/42  failures). 
For the others, sensitivity to maraviroc was lost due to a switch to CXCR4-virus (10/42) or mutations 
in  the  CCR5-virus,  related  to  reduce  activity  (5/42);  the  latter  in  a  way  representing  ”traditional 
antiretroviral resistance”. Importantly, the proportion and number of patients who acquired resistance 
to the NRTI backbone was much higher in the maraviroc group.  
This indicates a less favourable resistance profile in terms of the options of NRTI backbone for future 
treatments in the population previously exposed to maraviroc. 
Discussion and conclusion on efficacy 
Study  A4001026,  designed  to  compare  maraviroc  at  two  different  doses  (300  mg  QD  and  300  mg 
BID) versus efavirenz (600 mg QD), each in combination with zidovudine 300mg/lamivudine 150 mg 
BID,  failed  to  demonstrate  the  non-inferiority  of  maraviroc  300  mg  BID  regimen  over  a  standard 
regimen with efavirenz 600 mg QD for the treatment-naïve adult patients infected with CCR5-tropic 
HIV-1. 
Results of an interim analysis at week 16 precluded the continuation of maraviroc 300 QD treatment 
group due to failure in meeting pre-defined criteria for non-inferiority to efavirenz. The sample size 
decreased  and  the  study  continued  with  two  treatment  groups.  The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  at  48 
weeks of treatment failed to demonstrate non-inferiority of maraviroc 300g BID. Further analysis at 96 
weeks confirmed the lack of demonstration of non-inferiority. 
Efficacy  results  were  retrospectively  re-analysed  by  using  an  enhanced  sensitivity  Trofile  assay 
including patients without detectable CXCR4-virus at screening: 106 patients were reclassified (58 in 
the efavirenz group and 48 in the maraviroc group). In this re-analysis, non-inferiority of maraviroc 
over efavirenz at week 48 was shown but failed to be demonstrated at week 96.  
At week 96 the overall discontinuation rate was similar between the two treatment groups being lack 
of  efficacy  the  main  reason  in  the  maraviroc  group  and  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  in  the 
efavirenz group. 
In  those  patients  with  virological  failure  on  maraviroc  treatment,  around  two  out  of  three  showed  a 
virus still sensitive to maraviroc, while resistance to lamivudine was very common (around three out 
of  four patients). This indicates  a  less favourable  resistance  profile in terms  of  the  options  of  NRTI 
backbone for future treatments in the population previously exposed to maraviroc. 
Virological failure with resistance development will always be a major threat to HIV treatment with 
direct  acting  antiretrovirals.  Hence,  the  CHMP  had  major  concerns  on  the  clearly  lower  virological 
efficacy  of  maraviroc  in  treatment-naïve  patients  infected  with  CCR5-tropic  HIV-1  as  compared  to 
efavirenz  and  with  the  resistance  to  other  agents  which  were  3-4  times  more  commonly  seen  with 
maraviroc regardless of the Trofile assay used.  
These  concerns  were  expressed  to  the  MAH,  who  did  not  provide  any  new  relevant  data.  In 
conclusion, the CHMP was of opinion that the use of maraviroc is not approvable for treatment-naïve 
patients based on the results of study A4001026, due a high rate of virological failure and resistance. 
However,  the  CHMP  agreed  that  the  study  results  should  be  reflected  in  the  safety  section  of  the 
Celsentri  product  information  to  warn  against  the  use  of  maraviroc  in  CCR5-tropic  HIV-1  infected 
Page 9 of 13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment naïve adult patients. A summary of the study results supporting the warning should also be 
included in the product information. 
Further discussions were held, culminating with the MAH acknowledging these major concerns and 
not  pursuing  an  extension  of  the  therapeutic  indication  for  maraviroc  to  include  treatment-naïve 
patients.  
Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The safety analysis was primarily based on the 360 subjects who received maraviroc 300 mg BID and 
on  361  subjects  who  received  efavirenz  600  mg  QD  in  study  A4001026.  The  mean  duration  of 
exposure was similar between treatment groups (672 days, median). 
Adverse events (AEs). 
A similar proportion of patients in the maraviroc group and in the efavirenz group experienced an AE. 
Treatment related AE were more frequently reported in the efavirenz group.   
Serious adverse events (SAEs) and Death 
A total of 12 deaths (6 in each treatment group) were reported until the 96 week cut-off.  However, 5 
subjects (2 on maraviroc group and 3 on efavirenz group) died during the course of study or within 28 
days  of  study  discontinuation.  The  remaining  7  deaths  occurred  more  than  28  days  after  permanent 
study discontinuation (4 on maraviroc group and 3 on efavirenz group). 
Treatment-emergent  SAEs  considered  related  to  treatment  were  reported  in  2.8%  (10/360)  subjects 
treated with maraviroc 300 mg BID and in 4.8 % (17/361) of subjects treated with efavirenz 600 mg 
QD.  
The SAEs related to maraviroc treatment were: deep vein thrombosis, nasopharyngeal cancer (patient 
died),  vomiting,  nausea,  transaminases  increased,  anorexia,  abdominal  pain,  blood  creatinine 
phosphokinase  increased,  neutropenia,  Hodgkin’s  disease,  anaemia,  syncope,  diffuse  large  B-cell 
lymphoma (patient died), depression and transaminases increased. 
The  SAEs  related  to  efavirenz  treatment  were:  Pancytopenia,  anaemia,  haematuria,  flank  pain, 
myocardial infarction, rash macular, hepatic enzyme increased, rash, GGT increased, AST increased, 
blood  creatinine  phosphokinase  increased,  hepatitis,  hypersensitivity,  abortion  spontaneous,  multiple 
drug overdose intentional and suicide attempt. No deaths in the efavirenz group were associated with 
SAE related with efavirenz. 
Adverse events of interest 
Infections, AIDS events and malignancies 
The  incidence  of  infections  and  infestations  (62.5%  in  maraviroc  group  vs  62.3%  in  the  efavirenz 
group,  for  all  causality)  and  category  C  AIDS  events  (2.5  %  in  maraviroc  group  vs  3.3%  in  the 
efavirenz group) were overall similar between both treatment groups.  
There  was  no  clear  difference  in  severity  of  the  infections  and  infestations  between  the  treatment 
groups, with most being Grade 1 or 2. In category C AIDS events, in the maraviroc group one patient 
reported  pneumocytiis  jiroveci  pneumonia  and  another  tuberculosis  while  in  the  efavirenz  group,  6 
patients reported pulmonary tuberculosis and another tuberculosis.  
The incidence in terms of malignancies was: 1.4 % (5 subjects) in the maraviroc group and 3.3% (12 
subjects) in the efavirenz group. Of these, 3 subjects in the maraviroc group vs 0 in the efavirenz group 
had  reported  malignancies  considered  to  be  related  to  the  study  drug.  The  adverse  events  related  to 
malignancies  resulted  in  discontinuation  in  3  subjects  in  the  maraviroc  group  and  4  subjects  in  the 
efavirenz group.

Laboratory findings 
Overall,  lipid  changes  were  lower  with  maraviroc  as  compared  to  efavirenz.  Liver  enzymes  were 
raised  more  frequently  in  the  efavirenz  group.  No  significant  differences  were  found  in  other 
laboratory findings.  
Discontinuation due to AES 
The percentage of patients who permanently discontinued the study due to adverse events was lower 
in the maraviroc group 7.5% (27 subjects) as compared with efavirenz group 18.6% (67 subjects). The 
most  common  reasons  for  discontinuation  were  related  to  increased  transaminases,  nausea  and 
pregnancy  in  the  maraviroc  group  and  rash,  pregnancy,  tuberculosis,  dizziness  and  nausea  in  the 
efavirenz group.  
The  proportion  of  patients  who  temporarily  discontinued  study  was  similar  between  both  treatment 
groups (5%). 
Discussion and conclusion on safety 
In  general  the  safety  profile  of  maraviroc  in  the  HIV-infected  treatment-naïve  patients  was  not 
different from the already known safety profile in treatment-experienced patients. When compared to 
efavirenz,  maraviroc  is  overall  better  tolerated,  as  reflected  by  the  proportion  of  subjects  that 
discontinued in each treatment arm due to safety reasons. 
The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events were nausea (36.1% for maraviroc, 
34.6%  for  efavirenz),  headache  (25.3%  for  maraviroc,  25.2%  for  efavirenz),  diarrhoea  (8.1%  for 
maraviroc,  12.7%  for  efavirenz)  and  fatigue  (16.1%  for  maraviroc  and  14.1%  for  efavirenz).  The 
incidence of Grade 3 treatment-emergent adverse events was greater in the efavirenz arm. However, 
Grade 4 was similar for both treatment arms.  
A  total  of  94  subjects  permanently  discontinued  from  the  study  due  to  treatment  emergent  adverse 
events;  27  (7.5%)  subjects  were  receiving  maraviroc  and  67  (18.6%)  subjects  were  receiving 
efavirenz.  The  most  common  reasons  for  discontinuation  were  related  to  increased  transaminases, 
nausea and pregnancy in the maraviroc group and rash, pregnancy, tuberculosis, dizziness and nausea 
in the efavirenz group.  
As  regards  adverse  events  of  interest  for  maraviroc  no  differences  could  be  detected  in  this  study. 
However, with regard to infections and infestations a substantially higher proportion of subjects with 
pulmonary tuberculosis were reported in the efavirenz group. This finding may be related to eventual 
differences either in terms of the recovery of immune function or to specific interference of maraviroc 
in  the  immune  response  to  M.  tuberculosis  infection.  This  was  further  discussed  and  at  the  present 
time with the data available no conclusion can be made.  
Overall conclusion and Benefit-Risk assessment 
Study A4001026, the only comparative study of maraviroc as a first line treatment in treatment-naïve 
CCR5  infected  HIV-1  adult  patients  in  combination  with  zidovudine/lamivudine  as  compared  to 
efavirenz  in  combination  with  zidovudine/lamivudine,  failed  to  demonstrate  the  non-inferiority  of 
maraviroc. Although the NRTI backbone used in this study is no longer recommended in first line, it 
was a reasonable therapeutic option at the time the study was planned.  
The efficacy results observed with the efavirenz group are similar to those seen in other randomised 
studies (typically around 70% after 48 weeks of therapy). The loss of efficacy for maraviroc occurred 
already during early treatment, and was for the most not related to a switch in viral tropism.  
The number of discontinuations due to lack of efficacy was 2-3 times higher with maraviroc and in 
summary, around 3-4 times as many patients in the maraviroc group developed resistance to the NRTI 
backbone (in particular lamivudine). Lamivudine and the closely related emtricitabine (also cytosine 
analogue with same resistance pattern) are medicinal products currently used in first line regimens. 
A  somewhat  improved  outcome  was  shown  in  a  retrospective  re-analysis  of  the  efficacy  and  safety 
results  by  using  an  enhanced  sensitivity  Trofile  assay  to  detect  very  low  levels  of  CXCR4-virus. 
Page 11 of 13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hence, the need for a very sensitive assay to select patients without detectable CXCR4-virus was clear 
from  the  data  presented.  However,  also  in  this  censored  population  lack  of  efficacy  and  resistance 
development to the NRTI backbone was considerably more common with maraviroc. 
It could be argued that poor conduct of this study, with a higher proportion of patients discontinuing 
therapy than in other recent and important studies in treatment naïve patients, could be one reason for 
the results obtained. The drop-out rate could also indicate that the actual compliance was low.  
However, the fact that virological failure and resistance development was much more common with 
maraviroc than with efavirenz – this last with a low barrier to resistance and with a high tendency for 
resistance development – could be interpreted as maraviroc being a medicinal product of rather low 
potency and where failure is associated with a high risk of resistance. 
The  safety  profile  of  maraviroc  in  the treatment  naïve  patient population  was  not  different  from  the 
already known mid-term profile in treatment-experienced patients. The impact of CCR5-inhibition on 
immune  function,  including  for  example  risk  for  malignancy  must  be  studied  at  longer  term  and  in 
larger populations before a final conclusion is made.  
Based  on  results  of  study  A4001026,  the  presently  favourable  safety  profile  of  maraviroc  does  not 
outweigh the high risk for virological failure and resistance development in the treatment of CCR5-
tropic HIV-1 infected adult antiretroviral-naïve patients. However, results of study 1026 are relevant 
to be reflected in the Celsentri product information. 
The  MAH,  acknowledging  the  CHMP  concerns,  proposed  not  to  pursue  with  an  extension  of 
indication  for  Celsentri  in  treatment-naïve  CCR5  infected  HIV-1  adult  patients,  however  agreed  to 
reflect the results of this study in the SPC in the relevant sections. 
Changes to the Product Information 
As above discussed, it was agreed that the results for study A4001026 should be mentioned in the SPC 
as follows: 
•  Section 4.4 “Special warnings and precautions for use” 
CELSENTRI  is  not  recommended  to  be  used  in  treatment  naïve  patients  based  on  the  results  of  a 
clinical study in this population (see section 5.1) 
•  Section 5.1 “Pharmacodynamic properties” 
In vivo: 
Treatment naïve patients 
“The resistance profile in treatment-naïve patients has not been characterized.”   
Studies in Treatment Naïve Patients  
An ongoing randomised, double-blinded study (MERIT), is exploring CELSENTRI versus efavirenz, 
both in combination with zidovudine/lamivudine (n=721, 1:1). After 48 weeks of treatment, 
CELSENTRI did not reach non-inferiority to efavirenz for the endpoint of HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml 
(65.3 vs. 69.3 % respectively, lower confidence bound -11.9%). More patients treated with 
CELSENTRI discontinued due to lack of efficacy (43 vs.15) and among patients with lack of efficacy, 
the proportion acquiring NRTI resistance (mainly lamivudine) was higher in the CELSENTRI arm. 
Fewer patients discontinued CELSENTRI due to adverse events (15 vs.49).

Furthermore, section 6.6 was amended to include standard statement on disposal measures. 
•  Section 6.6 “Special precautions for disposal” 
No special requirementsAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance 
with local requirements. 
Conclusion 
On 24 September 2009 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the 
amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics, subject to the commitment 
undertaken.

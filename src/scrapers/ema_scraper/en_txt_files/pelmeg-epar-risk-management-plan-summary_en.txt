Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan 
Summary of risk management plan for pegfilgrastim 
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  company  pegfilgrastim.  The  RMP 
details  important  risks  of  pegfilgrastim,  how  these  risks  can  be  minimised,  and  how  more 
information will be obtained about pegfilgrastim’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Company pegfilgrastim’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential  information  to  healthcare  professionals  and  patients  on  how  pegfilgrastim  should  be 
used.  
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  company  pegfilgrastim  should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all 
which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of company 
pegfilgrastim’s RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Pegfilgrastim is a biosimilar medicine authorised for reducing the duration of neutropenia and the 
incidence  of  febrile  neutropenia  in  adult  patients  treated  with  cytotoxic  chemotherapy  for 
malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes), 
see SmPC for the full indication. It contains pegfilgrastim as the active substance, which is already 
authorised in the European Union. It is given by subcutaneous injection. 
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  company  pegfilgrastim’s  benefits  can  be  found  in 
company pegfilgrastim’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
website, under the medicine’s webpage. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or 
further characterise the risks  
Important risks of company pegfilgrastim, together with measures to minimise such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about company pegfilgrastim’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific  information, such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly  analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment,  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of company pegfilgrastim is not yet 
available, it is listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of company pegfilgrastim are risks that need special risk management activities 
to  further  investigate  or  minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  used. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of company pegfilgrastim. Potential risks are concerns 
for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

The risk factors for development of capillary leak syndrome 
attributed to G-CSF use are not fully elucidated. 
This syndrome was found independent on patients’ age. The 
potential risk factors for development of capillary leak 
syndrome are underlying condition (e.g., acute graft-versus-
host disease, bone marrow transplantation), use of certain 
medication (including G-CSF or cyclosporine A) or treatment 
strategies (e.g., intensive radio- and chemotherapy). 
However, the use of G-CSF was only a non-significant risk 
factor for the development of this syndrome if no other 
contributing factors were present. 
The risk factors for development of capillary leak syndrome, 
identified in a study in paediatric patients undergoing stem 
cell transplantation were severe infection (presented with 
fever, inflammation marker increase and eventual 
haemodynamic instability) and acute graft-versus-host 
disease. 
Other potential risk factors suggested in association with G-
CSF-use include enhanced leukocytosis

Patients with pre-existing renal injury are more prone to 
pegfilgrastim-induced glomerulonephritis. 
More cases of glomerulonephritis were reported in patients 
with severe congenital neutropenia who require long-term 
treatment with G-CSF and other therapeutic agents, even 
though, the causal link to G-CSF is not always established.

Patients receiving chemotherapy with known potential for 
pulmonary toxicity (e.g. bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, or 
doxorubicin) are at increased risk of (exaggerated) 
pulmonary toxicity associated with the activity of G-CSF. 
Same level of risk applies to patients receiving oxygen 
therapy or radiotherapy prior to treatment with G-CSF.

A recent history of pulmonary infiltrates in neutropenic 
patients may represent a risk factor for the development of 
acute respiratory distress syndrome at neutropenia 
recovery. The risk of G-CSF- induced acute respiratory 
distress syndrome further increases in patients with human 
leukocyte antigens-B51/B52, presence of pulmonary fibrosis 
and pneumonia or other underlying lung disease, especially 
if pneumonia is associated with sepsis. 
Elderly and infants undergoing chemotherapy may be more 
prone to pulmonary toxicity associated with G- CSF.

No specific text in the product information is deemed

if this potential risk is confirmed as associated with 
pegfilgrastim, all reference documents will be updated.

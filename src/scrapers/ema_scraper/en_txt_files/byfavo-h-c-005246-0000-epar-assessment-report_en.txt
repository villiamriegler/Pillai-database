1  Background information on the procedure 
1.1  Submission of the dossier 
On 31 December 2021 PAION Netherlands B.V. applied for an extension of the marketing 
authorisation to introduce a new pharmaceutical form associated with a new strength: 50 mg powder 
for concentrate for solution for injection/infusion (powder for concentrate).  
The new presentation is indicated to include the intravenous (IV) induction and maintenance of general 
anesthesia (GA) in adults for Byfavo 50 mg, based on the final results from two pivotal trials:  
• 
• 
Study ONO-2745-05, a phase IIb/III, single-blind, randomised, parallel-group study assessing 
safety and efficacy in induction and maintenance of anaesthesia in ASA I/II patients (general 
surgery);  
study CNS-7056-022, a phase III, randomized, propofol controlled, parallel group, 
confirmatory single-blind efficacy and safety trial during induction and maintenance of 
anaesthesia in ASA III/IV patients.  
A new combined version of the summary of product characteristics (SmPC), labelling and Package 
Leaflet (PL) solely for the 50 mg strength and the GA indication is provided accordingly. 
Version 1.1 of the RMP has also been submitted.  
As part of the application, the MAH also requested an extension of the market protection by one 
additional year.An application for the transfer of Marketing Authorisation (MA) from Paion Netherlands 
B.V. to PAION Deutschland GmbH was submitted on 1 September 2022 (and completed on 21 
September 2022; EC decision: 7 October 2022). 
1.2  Legal basis  
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article  7.2(b)  EC  No  1234/2008  to  extend  Byfavo  marketing  authorization  for  an  additional 
strength/pharmaceutical form, including a new therapeutic indication. This new indication does not fall 
within any orphan designation.  
1.3  Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant  to  Article  7  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  the  application  included  an  EMA  Decision 
P/0427/2021 on the agreement of a Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0427/2021 of 29 October 2021, was complete.  
The Paediatric Committee (PDCO) issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP: EMEA-C1-001880-

The MAH requested consideration of one year marketing protection in regards of its application for a 
new indication in accordance with Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) 726/2004.  
This request was withdrawn during the procedure.  
1.6  Scientific advice 
Scientific advice was sought from EMA prior to initiate a pivotal Phase III trial for remimazolam (RMZ) 
in the indication of general anaesthesia (GA) in adults: 
1.  Procedure No.: EMEA/H/SA/2825/1/2014/SME/III 
SA  on  the  development  programme  for  remimazolam  (RMZ)  for  the  indication  of  GA,  prior  to  the 
initiation of a Phase III study; 
2.  Procedure No.: EMEA/H/SA/2825/1/FU/1/2015/SME/III 
Follow-up (FU) discussion on the previously finalized SA procedure 
EMEA/H/SA/2825/1/2014/SME/III on the development programme for remimazolam for the 
indication of GA; 
In February 2016 the Phase III trial for which SA was obtained, in 2014 and 2015, as above noted, 
was terminated early due to the complex trial design and recruitment problems. 
3.  Procedure No.: EMEA/H/SA/2825/1/FU/2/2017/SME/II

2  Scientific discussion 
2.1  Problem statement  
Minimising patient discomfort via producing a calming or unconscious effect and thereby facilitating the 
conduct  of  diagnostic  and  therapeutic  procedures  is  the  objective  of  procedural  sedation  and  general 
anaesthesia. 
2.1.1  Disease or condition 
General anaesthesia (GA) differs from procedural sedation by the depth of sedation/hypnosis, duration 
and  often  the  ability  of  the  subject  to  breathe  independently  or  to  require  ventilatory  support,  and  is 
usually  required  for  major  surgery.  This  can  be  accomplished  through  different  methods,  including 
inhalation anaesthesia or total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA). For the latter, a strong very short acting 
hypnotic (e.g., propofol, midazolam, or remimazolam) is usually combined with a strong analgesic (e.g. 
remifentanil).  
2.1.2  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Due  to  the  different  methods  and  combinations  of  anaesthesia  that  may  be  employed  for  the  same 
condition,  it  is  difficult  to  find  exact  figures  applied  across  all  possible  indications.  In  general,  major 
surgeries  will  require  general  anaesthesia,  thus  a  reasonable  surrogate  of  the  number  of  subjects 
undergoing general anaesthesia may be the number of major surgical procedures performed per year. 
In 2009, an estimated 48 million surgical procedures were performed in the United States of America 
(USA) according to the Stanford Health Care (SHC). Eurostat does not provide cumulative data across 
all possible surgeries performed in the European Economic Area (EEA) in 2018; however, it does indicate 
that the most frequent surgeries per 100,000 population occurred for cataract in 267-1656, Caesarean 
section  in  141-581,  transluminal  coronary  angioplasty  in  119-410,  cholecystectomy  in  52-294,  and 
inguinal  hernia  repair  in  60-277  in  the  EEA  countries  plus  Switzerland,  North  Macedonia  and  Serbia 
(Eurostat 2020), with an estimated European Union (EU) population size at the time of approximately 
448 million people.  
Currently, inhalation anaesthesia is a popular method of general anaesthesia, with TIVA accounting for 
a more limited percentage, due to often higher cost and technical requirements, as reflected in the United 
Kingdom  (UK)  guidance  on  general  anaesthesia  (Al-Rifai  2016).  However,  these  numbers  vary  from 
country  to  country  and  may  depend  upon  available  resources,  anaesthesiologist  experience,  national 
guidelines, and even patient preference (some subjects dislike the anaesthesia mask during induction). 
Recently, the Covid-19 pandemic may have resulted in some increase in the use of TIVA, due to possible 
lower risk of coughing and shorter time of recovery (Stewart 2020). 
2.1.3  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
Subjects undergoing surgical procedures can range from healthy (ASA-PS I) to severely morbid (ASA-
PS III–IV) male or female subjects, of any race or ethnic origin, aged 18 years and above. In younger 
age groups the requirement for surgery will be more driven by trauma, diseases such as appendicitis, or 
need  for  caesarean  section  while  with  advancing  age  vascular  diseases,  cancer,  degenerative  joint 
conditions and cataracts will contribute more to the requirement for surgery. 
2.1.4  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
General Anaesthesia is a satellite condition to major surgery. 
Assessment report  
EMA/79576/2023  
Page 10/129 
 
 
 
Important co-morbidities 
Any co-morbid condition could be present. Hence, an ideal anaesthetic agent should cause predictable 
and  well-controllable  levels  of  anaesthesia,  rapid  onset  and  recovery,  with  low  risk  of  respiratory 
depression, of cardiovascular effects or of other adverse reactions. 
ASA-PS (American Society Of Anesthesiologists Physical Status) Classification 
The ASA PS Classification System has been in use for over 60 years (please refer to the Table 1). The 
purpose of the system is to assess and communicate patient’s pre-anaesthesia medical co-morbidities. 
The classification system alone does not predict the perioperative risks, but used with other factors (e.g. 
type of surgery, frailty, level of deconditioning), it can be helpful in predicting perioperative risks.

2.1.5  Management 
In  Europe,  the  currently  authorised  medications  for  use  in  “induction  and  maintenance  of  general 
anaesthesia” include propofol as the most commonly used agent, followed by volatile gases (inhalation 
vapours,  or  halogenated  anaesthetics,  e.g.  sevoflurane,  desflurane,  isoflurane),  mostly  used  in 
conjunction with IV anaesthetics and not so frequently for induction of anaesthesia. 
Risks associated with the  inhalation anaesthetics include malignant hyperthermia, long QT syndrome, 
severe post-operative nausea and vomiting, potential cerebral oedema, and myasthenia gravis. Propofol 
based TIVA is associated with the possible risks of injection site pain, anaphylactic reactions to the soy

components  in  the  lipid  emulsion,  and  severe  hypotension  combined  with  a  bradycardia  effect.  Other 
benzodiazepines, in particular midazolam, have also been used for TIVA but have become less popular, 
due  to  their  longer  duration  of  action  resulting  in  delayed  recovery,  and  possibly  higher  risk  of  post-
operative delirium. The latter is a multifactorial condition which can occur after any form of anaesthesia. 
2.2  About the product 
Remimazolam  (also  referred  to  as  CNS7056  or  ONO-2745)  is  a  benzodiazepine  (BDZ)  that  has  been 
approved as an ultra-short-acting intravenous (IV) agent for use in procedural sedation. 
The current application indication is for “intravenous induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia 
in adults”. 
2.3  Type of Application and aspects on development 
The MAH submitted an application under article 7.2(b) EC No 1234/2008 to extend Byfavo marketing 
authorization for an additional strength/pharmaceutical form, including a new therapeutic indication.  
2.4  Quality aspects 
2.4.1 Introduction 
This line extension concerns the addition of a new strength and pharmaceutical form (50 mg powder 
for concentrate for solution for injection/infusion) to the existing strength/pharmaceutical form (20 mg 
powder for solution for injection) in order to support the proposed extension of indication to 
“intravenous induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia in adults”.  
The finished product is presented as a powder for concentrate for solution for injection/infusion 
containing remimazolam besylate equivalent to 50 mg remimazolam as active substance. 
After reconstitution each mL of concentrate contains 5 mg remimazolam. Dilution is required to reach 
final concentration of 1-2 mg/mL. 
Other ingredients are: lactose monohydrate, dextran 40 for injection, hydrochloric acid (for pH 
adjustment) and sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment). 
The product is available in a type 1 glass vial with a stopper (bromobutyl rubber) and seal (aluminium) 
with a green polypropylene flip-off cap as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.4.2 Active Substance 
The active substance documentation is identical to that previously approved for the authorised 
strength and is acceptable. Physico-chemical properties of the active substance that are relevant for 
the new strengths have been adequately addressed in the pharmaceutical development of the finished 
product. 
2.4.3 Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1 Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development   
The  finished  product  is  a  sterile,  white  to  off-white  lyophilised  powder.  The  product  requires 
reconstitution before use with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection.  
Assessment report  
EMA/79576/2023  
Page 12/129 
 
 
 
The  finished  product  is  packaged  into  12  mL  type  I  clear  glass  vials  fitted  with  bromobutyl  rubber 
stoppers and capped with aluminum seals with polypropylene flip-off caps. 
All  excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical  ingredients  and  their  quality  is  compliant  with  Ph.  Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients

solution for intravenous injection or infusion show a good reproducibility with all presented data matching 
the specifications and in compliance with results obtained from finished product release testing.  
2.4.3.3 Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
The finished product release and shelf-life/stability specifications  include appropriate tests for this kind 
of  dosage  form  including  appearance  (powder,  and  reconstituted  solution  (Ph.  Eur.),  time  to 
reconstitution, osmolality following reconstitution (Ph. Eur.), extractable volume following reconstitution 
(Ph. Eur.), identification (UV, HPLC), visible particulates (Ph. Eur.), sub-visible particulates (Ph. Eur.), 
pH following reconstitution (Ph. Eur.), remimazolam vial content (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. 
Eur.),  degradation  products  (HPLC),  moisture  content  (Karl  Fischer  Titration),  sterility  (Ph.  Eur.)  and 
bacterial endotoxins.  
Assessment report  
EMA/79576/2023  
Page 13/129 
 
 
 
The  finished  product  specification  is  considered  acceptable  as  it  is  in  line  with  relevant  Ph.Eur. 
monographs and scientific guidelines as well as batch analysis.  
A limit for bacterial endotoxins is in line with Ph.Eur. 5.1.10 monograph and, thus acceptable.  
According to ICH Q3B, identification and qualification threshold is 0.2% (based on the maximum daily 
dose of 1  g  as worst case). Therefore, stricter limits for a named impurity and individual unidentified 
impurities are acceptable. Considering that the named impurity is the main metabolite of remimazolam, 
proposed limits are regarded as qualified. 
Satisfactory  details  have  been  provided  for  the  pharmacopoeial  and  non-pharmacopoeial  analytical 
methods The validation data of the analytical methods provided are in accordance with the requirements 
of the relevant ICH guidelines and can therefore be accepted. 
Batch analyses confirm compliance with the proposed finished product specifications.  
A risk-based approach to assess the potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product is 
presented in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities.  
In terms of a robust risk evaluation, a detailed examination of the manufacturing process in terms of 
risk  of  formation  and  contamination  of  N-nitrosamines  in  active  substance  and  finished  product  is 
provided  from  the  finished  product  manufacturer.  The  potential  presence  of  nitrosamines  in 
Remimazolam  50  mg  Powder  for  solution  for  intravenous  injection  or  infusion  was  evaluated  in 
accordance with the CHMP guidelines. Based on the information provided it is accepted that no risk was 
identified  on  the  possible  presence  of  nitrosamine  impurities  in  the  active  substance  or  the  related 
finished product. Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed necessary. 
For reference standards used for the analysis of finished product, cross-references to active substance 
section 3.2.S.5 is made. This is acceptable. 
2.4.3.4 Stability of the product 
Stability data from multiple finished product batches stored up to 24 months, 36 months, and 66 months 
at long term stability conditions of 25ºC/60%RH and up to 6 months at accelerated stability conditions 
of 40ºC/75%RH, according to the ICH guidelines, were provided. These batches are identical to those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested in line with the finished product shelf life specification. The analytical procedures 
used are stability indicating. The results complied with specifications. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. Results from photo-stability testing demonstrate that the vials must 
be protected from light during long term storage using suitable secondary packaging material such as a 
sealed cardboard carton. 
An in-use stability study of the product after dilution of with 10 mL sterile 0.9 % sodium chloride solution 
was also performed. All results of the tested physicochemical parameters were within the specifications. 
Based on the presented results, the reconstituted product is physically and chemically stable for 24 hours 
at 25°C/60%RH (appearance, pH, assay, sub-visible particles and impurities are within specified limits). 
A statement in section 6.3 of the SmPC is according CPMP/QWP/159/96 corr is provided.  
Commitment that one production batch per year of finished product will be placed on long term stability 
(25ºC/60% RH) is provided. Confirmation of compliance with CPMP/QWP/072/96 regarding start of shelf-
life of the finished dosage form is provided. 
Assessment report  
EMA/79576/2023  
Page 14/129 
 
 
 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 4 years as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) 
is acceptable. Except from the protection from light, the medicinal product does not require any other 
special storage recommendations.

2.5  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1  Introduction 
Remimazolam was designed to be a sedative/anaesthetic drug with a short duration of action due to its 
breakdown by carboxylesterases to an inactive metabolite (CNS7054). It acts as an agonist on the 
benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor. The non-clinical profile of remimazolam was 
comprehensively characterised and assessed during initial Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA).  
The following studies were added for the submission of the general anaesthesia (GA) indication: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Receptor binding study of remimazolam and CNS7054 to peripheral benzodiazepine receptor  
Investigation of the PK of remimazolam in milk of lactating sheep following continuous infusion  
Investigation of the oral BA of remimazolam in suckling lambs  
Investigation of the PK, stability of metabolism and tissue distribution following 3 day long 
infusion in pig animal model of poly-trauma  
78890 study investigating buccal BA of remimazolam in minipigs  
Feasibility studies performed in juvenile minipigs (78736) and juvenile rats (38415) 
The evaluation of the above studies did not identify any particular concerns.  
2.5.2  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An  environmental  Phase  I  and  II  risk  assessment  has  been  conducted  to  evaluate  the  risk  to  the 
environment arising from use of remimazolam besilate 50 mg (powder for concentrate for solution for 
injection/infusion), for i.v. induction and maintenance of GA in adults. 
In  the  final  ERA  report,  only  the  current  version  Guideline  on  the  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  of 
Medicinal Products for Human Use EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2, 2006 and Questions and answers 
document  on  the  Guideline  EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010  Rev.1,  2016  were  followed  for  the 
Environmental Risk Assessment.  
Relevant endpoints, methods used and results obtained were discussed and the main study results are 
summarised in the Table 2. Some issues of concern were raised during the procedure.

The log D values experimentally determined for remimazolam in the environmental pH range of 5 to 9 
were 2.4 (pH 5) to 2.52 (pH 7 and 9). These are significantly lower than the trigger value of 4.5 for a 
PBT  assessment  and  not  close  to  the  trigger  value  of  3  for  performing  a  bioaccumulation  study 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 Rev. 1,2016). In the ERA report pKa and Log P/D measurements were 
experimentally determined by UV and potentiometric methods. A report of the study Pka and LogP study 
on  CNS7056  confirms.  All  the  results  demonstrate  unanimously  log  Dow  values  for  remimazolam  are 
considerably below 4.5 and are acceptable.  
Fpen was refined and is in line with the Questions and answers document (EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 
Rev.  1,  2016)  “Refinement  based  on  treatment  regime”  that  is  easily  done  for  products  intended  for 
single use, taking the worst-case treatment regime and worst-case number of treatment repetitions into 
consideration. 
The Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) in surface water (PECsurface water) calculated in Phase 
I  exceeded  the  trigger  value  of  0.01μg/L  and  a  Phase  II  environmental  fate  and  effects  analysis  was 
undertaken. 
Data from the OECD TG106 was presented and the adsorption coefficient Koc was estimated to range 
between 50.6 to 261 L/Kg using the method OECD 106. These Koc values are well below the action limit 
(10 000 L/Kg) and suggests that remimazolam has a low adsorption to sludge. No terrestrial studies are 
triggered. 
The MAH claimed that remimazolam is not considered to be readily biodegradable, but the 
biodegradability test (OECD 301) was not conducted. This test can be waived if the OECD 308 test is 
performed, according to EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010, Rev. 1, 2016, where indicated that a 
water/sediment study (OECD 308) is needed for substances that are not readily biodegradable. 
Ultimately, as outlined in a letter of commitment, the MAH agreed to provide remimazolam 
transformation in water-sediment systems according to OECD 308 test and the study report as post-
approval commitment. Furthermore, the MAH committed to submit an amended ERA report as post-
approval commitment, by the end of 2023. 
In order to perform a phase II Tier A, a review of the ecotoxicological data were provided. The effects of 
remimazolam  besilate  on  sludge  microorganisms,  algae,  daphnia  and  fish  were  studied  in  accordance 
with OECD test guidelines and GLP. The reported NOEC values are considered valid.  
The predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) values derived from the laboratory studies were compared 
to  predicted  environmental  concentration  (PEC)  values.  The  risk  ratios  (PEC/PNEC)  presented  for 
different  environmental  compartments  are  well  below  the  action limit.  Therefore,  the  potential  risk  of 
remimazolam besilate to the environment is considered low. 
Conclusion on ERA 
An  updated  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  (ERA)  for  remimazolam  was  provided  in  accordance  with 
the  principles  of  the  CHMP  guideline  of  Guideline  on  the  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  of  Medicinal 
Products for Human Use EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2, 2006 and Questions and answers document 
on the Guideline EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 Rev.1., 2016, which is endorsed.  
The  applicant  commits  to  provide  a  report  on  the  OECD  308  study  currently  being  conducted  with 
remimazolam  and  an  updated  overall  ERA  report  by  the  end  of  2023.  A  letter  of  commitment  was 
provided by the MAH as requested.

2.5.3  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The following was concluded during the original MAA and remains unchanged during this procedure: 
•  Remimazolam was designed to be a sedative/anaesthetic drug with a short duration of action 
due to its breakdown by carboxylesterases to an inactive metabolite (CNS7054). It acts as an 
agonist on the benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor, but may offer more predictable action 
and  quicker  recovery  than  midazolam  due  to  a  faster  systemic  clearance.  These  properties  of 
remimazolam  were  confirmed  in  early  non-clinical  pharmacodynamic  and  pharmacokinetic 
studies.  
•  A substantial number of studies in variety of animal models were performed in order to assess 
non-clinical  properties  of  remimazolam  and  assessed  as  part  of  IMAA.  Remimazolam  showed 
sedative activity in all animal species studied, with a rapid onset and a short duration of sedation. 
The  sedation  was  reversible  with  flumazenil.  Remimazolam  produced  amnesia  in  a  passive 
avoidance study in rats at dose levels similar to midazolam.  
• 
• 
The safety profile of remimazolam is consistent with other members of the benzodiazepine class 
of drugs, (i.e. cardiorespiratory depressant effects at supratherapeutic doses). 
Pharmacodynamic  interaction  studies  demonstrated  synergism  between  remimazolam  and 
narcotics with activity at sites other than the benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor while 
there  was  no  such  synergism  with  sedatives  having  the  same  mechanism  of  action  as 
remimazolam.  
•  Non clinical interactions studies indicate a very low potential of remimazolam for interactions, 
neither as a victim nor as a perpetrator.  
The non-clinical studies submitted in support of this extension application do not impact the overall non-
clinical profile assessment.  
The MAH submitted a letter of commitment to confirm provision of remimazolam transformation in water-
sediment  systems  according  to  OECD  308  test  and  the  study  report  as  post-approval  commitment. 
Furthermore, the MAH confirmed these data will be included in a revised ERA report, to be also submitted 
as a post-approval commitment, by end of 2023.  
2.5.4  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP consider that the application for remimazolam 50 mg powder for concentrate for solution for 
injection/infusion is approvable from the overall non-clinical perspective. 
2.6  Clinical aspects 
2.6.1  Introduction

2.6.2  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1  Pharmacokinetics 
The main conclusions from previously submitted PK studies are: 
•  Due to its high clearance, short half-life and inactive primary metabolite, RMZ hypnotic effect is very 
predictable and allows for a considerable level of control over the depth of anaesthesia; 
•  RMZ anaesthetic effects wear off fast and with little variability; 
•  Cmax and AUC increase proportional with the dose; 
• 
Population  PK  analysis  demonstrated  that  body  weight  and  BMI  were  not  a  significant  factor 
contributing  to inter-subject variability in systemic exposure. There is no  evidence  that dosing by 
body  size  will  lead  to  decreased  variability  in  systemic  exposure  compared  to  using  fixed  doses. 
Hence, RMZ can be dosed independently of body weight; 
•  RMZ sedative effects can be effectively reversed by flumazenil. Due to similar elimination half-lives 
of the two drugs there is low probability for re-sedation;  
• 
The PK profile is not affected by age, sex, race, body weight, renal impairment, or mild-to-moderate 
hepatic impairment; 
•  RMZ  is  metabolized  by  abundant  liver  carboxyesterase.  There  is  a  low  potential  for  its  PK  to  be 
influenced by other drugs;  
•  RMZ  and  its  primary  metabolite  do  not  induce  or  inhibit  any  tested  CYP  enzymes  and  are  not 
substrates  or  inhibitors  of  tested  human  drug  transporters  at  clinically  relevant  concentrations; 
likewise, studies did not reveal a relevant inhibitory potential regarding esterase substrates including 
hepatic carboxyesterase. Thus, there is a low potential to affect the PK of other drugs.  
New PK information in the present application: (study CNS7056-022) 
As  part  of  the  clinical  development  program  of  remimazolam  for  injection  50  mg/vial,  the  safety  and 
efficacy of RMZ for GA have been investigated in the pivotal Phase III trial CNS7056-022. 
In this study venous blood samples for PK analysis of remimazolam were obtained from a limited number 
of consenting patients at selected sites during induction, maintenance and after end of the infusion.  
Assessment report  
EMA/79576/2023  
Page 21/129 
 
 
 
 
A prolonged sedation was reported for 31 patients (11% of the study population). 
Using a population PK model and an exposure-response (ER) time-to-event (TTE) analysis approach, it 
was  evaluated  whether  a  difference  between  these  delayed  wake-up  patients  and  the  other  patients 
(i.e., patients for which this AE was not reported) could be identified. 
The formal covariate analysis performed for each TTE endpoint indicated that:  
• 
• 
Younger people are predicted to reach each endpoint earlier.  
Females  are  predicted  to  wake  up  earlier  for  the  Awakening  as  reported  by  the  investigator  and 
MOAA/S based recovery endpoints, but not for the Aldrete score and Extubation endpoints.  
•  Subjects who received an opioid and/or (es)ketamine prior to awakening and within 1h before to 1h 
after end of remimazolam infusion, tend to reach awakening as reported by the PI endpoint earlier.  
•  Body  weight  and  serotonin  antagonist  use  prior  to  reaching  each  endpoint  did  not  significantly 
influence the time to event for any of the investigated recovery endpoints. 
•  When  informing  the  final  model  for  each  endpoint  with  the  information  of  whether  a  subject  was 
identified as a delayed wake-up patient or not, the model fit improved significantly. Thus, a difference 
in individual PK parameters and covariate effects do not fully explain the differences in time-to-event 
between the delayed and normal wake-up groups. 
It was concluded that the difference between the delayed wake-up versus normal wake-up patients could 
not be fully explained by a difference in individual PK parameters, i.e., drug exposure and the evaluated 
covariate  effects  could  only  partially  explain  some  of  the  differences  in  time-to-event  between  the 
delayed and normal wake-up groups. Within the current procedure, the MAH has described three studies 
as part of the planned approach to further explain the differences observed between delayed and normal 
wake up patients:  
• 
• 
• 
The first study, currently ongoing, is a Phase I clinical trial to assess the PD and PK interaction 
of  remimazolam  and  remifentanil.  The  objective  is  to  quantify  the  remimazolam  exposure-
response relationship with and without remifentanil based on various PD endpoints in order to 
develop  PK-PD  models  describing  the  relationship  between  effect-site  concentrations  of 
remimazolam  with  and without  remifentanil  and  various  PD  endpoints,  corresponding  to  mild, 
moderate, and deep sedation.  
A second study, also ongoing, is developing a PK/PD model for remimazolam using all up to 
now available data (including the data collected in the Phase III EU trial in general anesthesia, 
CNS7056-022  as  well  as  the  data  from  the  Phase I  PK/PD  interaction  trial  described  in  the 
paragraph above). 
A  third  study  is  planned  to  provide  a  clinical  validation  of  a  possible  remimazolam  Target 
Controlled Infusion (TCI) system in general anaesthesia, to be developed using the PK-PD model 
obtained as described in the paragraph above.  
It was agreed that the PK-PD models to be developed may help obtaining a better understanding of the 
relevant  factors  in  the  process  of  recovery,  by  identifying  significant  covariates  in  the  PK  and  PD  of 
remimazolam, thus contributing to explain the observed differences between delayed and normal wake 
up patients receiving remimazolam in their recovery from GA. 
Drug interactions 
In the initial MAA, the potential for remimazolam to cause clinically relevant DDIs was also evaluated for 
the GA setting where higher induction dose of 12 mg/kg/h was used. In study CNS7056-010, the highest 
individual  RMZ  concentration  observed  was  12.6  μg/ml.  Due  to  higher  remimazolam  concentrations 
Assessment report  
EMA/79576/2023  
Page 22/129 
 
 
 
observed in the GA setting compared to the procedural sedation setting, at the point of initial MAA, a 
need for re-evaluation of DDI potential with respect to inhibition of CYP2C8, CYP1A2 and OATP1B1 was 
deemed necessary when applying for a new indication. 
Within  this  line  extension  application,  in  study  CNS7056-010,  the  observed  mean  Cmax  at  6  mg/kg 
induction dose was 3.09 μg/ml, and mean Cmax at 12 mg/kg induction dose was 4.95 μg/ml. The latter 
will be used for calculations as a worst-case scenario. 
The  cut-off  values  (according 
to  EMA  Guideline  on 
Investigation  of  drug 
Interactions 
CHMP/EWP/560/95/Rev.1) used in the interpretation of presented DDI data, to predict potential for in 
vivo interactions, are presented below: 
Cmax=4.95  µg/ml,  MW=439.31  g/mol  (remimazolam  free  base)  (<=>  11.27  µM);  fu=10%; 
Cmax,u=1.13 µM 
50xCmax,u=56.5 µM  
In vitro remimazolam inhibited: 
•  CYP2C8  with  IC50  of  29.2  μM  and  CYP1A2  with  IC50  of  63.6  μM.  If  assumed  that  Ki  can  be 
estimated  by  using  equation  IC50/2,  Ki  values  for  both  tested  scenarios  (14.6  and  31.8  μM, 
respectively)  would  be  below  the  calculated  cut-off,  suggesting  that  potential  for  in  vivo 
interactions cannot be excluded.  
•  OATP1B1 with IC50 of 10 μM. IC50 is well below the calculated cut-off and potential for in vivo 
interactions cannot be excluded. 
The MAH stated that higher concentrations are achieved only in the very short induction phase and that 
remimazolam is rapidly metabolized; thus, there is no potential for clinically relevant interactions. 
Other calculations were done using the remimazolam concentrations achieved in the maintenance phase. 
During the maintenance phase, remimazolam concentrations were around 1 mg/L. 
Cmax=1 µg/ml, MW=439.31 g/mol (remimazolam free base) (<=> 2.28 µM); fu=10%; Cmax,u=0.23 µM 
50xCmax,u=11.5 µM 
If  remimazolam  concentrations  are  used  from  the  maintenance  phase,  it  can  be  agreed  there  is  no 
potential for in vivo inhibition of CYP2C8 and CYP1A2 by RMZ. However, IC50 for OATP1B1 inhibition is 
still below the cut-off and the potential for in vivo inhibition of OATP1B1 by remimazolam could not be 
excluded. 
The  MAH  provided  a  comprehensive  discussion  with  regards  to  potential  inhibition  of  OATP1B1  by 
remimazolam. Given that the cut-off value obtained by in vitro testing of OATP1B1 inhibition is borderline 
for its potential transition into a significant in vivo interaction, and given the specificities of the clinical 
setting  of  GA,  which  is  of  limited  duration,  it  is  considered  unlikely  that  remimazolam  would  cause  a 
clinically  relevant  interaction  with  OATP1B1  substrates.  Therefore,  it  can  be  agreed  that  no  specific 
warning is needed in the SmPC on this matter. 
Body weight 
Population PK analysis demonstrated that body weight and BMI were not a significant factor contributing 
to inter-subject variability in systemic exposure. There was no  evidence that dosing  by  body size will 
lead to decreased variability in systemic exposure compared to using body weight independent dosing.

2.6.2.2  Pharmacodynamics 
Remimazolam binds to brain benzodiazepine sites (gamma amino butyric acid type A [GABAA] 
receptors) with high affinity, while its carboxylic acid metabolite (CNS7054) has a 300 times lower 
affinity for the receptor.  
No new information is being submitted regarding RMZ mechanism of action. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
No new PD studies were submitted within this application for intravenous induction and maintenance of 
GA. 
Cardiovascular Risk Assessment 
The effect of remimazolam on QTc was assessed in two trials (CNS7056-005, CNS7056-017) and in a 
meta-analysis where demonstrated that RMZ has no direct effects on QTc interval. 
Abuse Liability assessment and Effect with Alcohol 
The  abuse  potential  of  single  doses  of  IV  remimazolam  was  assessed  in  healthy  recreational  central 
nervous system depressant users in trial CNS7056-014. Overall, it was concluded that IV remimazolam 
presents  a  significant  abuse  potential  compared  to  placebo,  and  comparable  to  or  lower  than  that  of 
midazolam.  
2.6.3  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology is basically the same for  both PS and  GA indications and there  are no new 
clinical pharmacology trials included in this application for GA. 
However, some sections were updated with the PK results of the European pivotal GA Phase III clinical 
trial (CNS7056-022) and new analyses of existing data to support various aspects of the GA indication. 
This includes data from a new PK/PD model and results from an integrated analysis of all GA trials. 
The pharmacological rational for the use of remimazolam is adequately supported by bibliography and 
by already approved medications. 
The sedative effect of remimazolam was shown to be rapidly reversed by administration of flumazenil, a 
benzodiazepine antagonist, with no re-sedation observed after the reversal of sedation with flumazenil. 
Given  its  pharmacological  characteristics  it  is  plausible  that  remimazolam  will  have  limited  PD 
interactions with other medicinal products and substances other than the ones acting also in the Central 
Nervous System as CNS depressants and/or sedatives. 
The relationship between plasma concentration of remimazolam and effect was well established both in 
direct measurements and PK/PD modelling. The plasma concentration of remimazolam correlates well 
with the primary endpoint (MOAA/S). 
The proposed dosing for the induction of general anaesthesia is: 
1. 
2. 
6 mg/min until loss of consciousness 
up to 12 mg/min if a fast induction is required 
Most adult patients are likely to require 10-40 mg Byfavo. 
The proposed dose for maintenance of general anaesthesia is: 
•  1 mg/min initially 
• 
option to increase up to 2.5 mg/min and to decrease down to 0.1 mg/min. 
Assessment report  
EMA/79576/2023  
Page 24/129 
 
 
 
 
As  outlined  in  section  4.2  of  the  SmPC,  for  maintenance  of  anaesthesia,  during  the  ongoing  infusion 
additional boluses of 6 mg over one minute can be given according to clinical requirements. A maximum 
of three (3) boluses not less than 5 min apart can be administered within 60 min. Towards the end of 
surgery (e.g. 15 min before the end) the dose of remimazolam may be titrated down to facilitate more 
rapid recovery from the anaesthetic effects. 
To assess the impact of body weight on the required induction dose, the MAH provided additional 
analyses of cumulative dose administered in patient subgroups across GA trials. Population PK analysis 
demonstrated that body weight and BMI were not a significant factor contributing to inter-subject 
variability in systemic exposure, hence remimazolam is recommended for body weight independent 
dosing. There is no evidence that dosing by body size will lead to decreased variability in systemic 
exposure compared to using body weight independent dosing. A trend is observed for a slight increase 
in cumulative dose administered with increasing body weight.  
It is agreed for the SmPC wording to refer to dosing independent of body weight, as the patients will 
be closely monitored and the dose titrated according to the patient’s response, as detailed in section 
4.2. 
In general, the pharmacodynamics of remimazolam falls within the expected profile of a very short-
acting BZD intended for procedural sedation or general anesthesia and no critical issues have been 
identified. 
2.6.4  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Body weight effects 
It is agreed for the SmPC wording to refer to dosing independent of body weight, as the patients will 
be closely monitored (see section 4.2) and the dose titrated according to the patient’s response.  
Posology 
Remimazolam dosing should be individually titrated to an effective dose which provides the desired 
level of sedation and minimises adverse reactions (see SmPC section 4.2).  
In the pivotal CNS7056-022 study, a maximum of 3 boluses (not less than 5 min apart) were allowed 
to be administered within 60 minutes. This information has been included in SmPC section 4.2.  
No dose adjustment is required in any grade of renal impairment and in patients with mild or moderate 
hepatic impairment. In patients with severe hepatic impairment, as the clinical effects may be more 
pronounced and last longer than in healthy subjects, no dose adjustments are also required but careful 
attention should be paid to the timing of titration doses and remimazolam titrated accordingly to effect 
in these patients (see SmPC section 4.4) 
2.6.5  Clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of remimazolam for induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia (GA) was evaluated 
in a total of six clinical trials (Table 3). Four of these evaluated efficacy of RMZ versus an active control. 
These trials were conducted in Europe and Japan; the MAH discussed and agreed with EMA and PMDA 
key aspects of the trial design during remimazolam development.

* study stopped when less than 10% of the planned sample size was enrolled (n enrolled = 23, n planned = 530) 
Four controlled studies were prospective, randomised, single-blind studies with propofol as comparator, 
though sevoflurane was also used in study CNS7056-010, in the time interval between end of intubation 
and  prior  to  extracorporeal  circulation.  These  studies  compared  remimazolam  with  propofol  during 
induction  and  maintenance  of  anaesthesia.  In  addition,  in  study  CNS7056-010  and  CNS7056-011 
remimazolam or propofol use could be extended until 24 hours after the end of surgery, whilst the patient 
was in the intensive care unit (ICU).  
CNS7056-011,  CNS7056-022  and  ONO-2745-05  were  all  non-inferiority  studies  using  propofol  as  a 
comparator.  CNS7056-022  and  ONO-2745-05  were  the  two  pivotal  studies  for  this  line  extension 
application, the former conducted in Europe, the latter in Japan.  
2.6.5.1  Dose response study(ies) 
Two Phase II trials, dose-finding, were conducted: 
•  ONO-2745-03: a dose finding trial conducted in adult patients in Japan, in four parts. Parts A and 
C investigated various doses of remimazolam for induction of GA in non-elderly and elderly patients, 
respectively. For maintenance of general anaesthesia these patients were switched to sevoflurane. 
Parts B and D confirmed the induction dose in non-elderly and elderly patients and anaesthesia was 
maintained with a starting dose of remimazolam identified in a phase I trial (ONO-2745-02). GA was 
performed to support mixed surgeries. No comparator arm was included. 
Results: 75 of the 85 enrolled subjects were included in the per protocol set (PPS) (Part A, 25; Part 
B, 25; Part C, 18; Part D, 7) and 85 subjects in the full analysis set (FAS) (Part A, 25; Part B, 30; 
Part C, 20; Part D, 10) which was used for the primary efficacy analysis. All remimazolam-treated 
subjects achieved loss of consciousness and completed tracheal intubation. All subjects in part B and 
part D completed surgery without any requirement for rescue sedative medication.  
During  the  induction  phase,  loss  of  consciousness  (LoC)  was  associated  with  a  decrease  in  the 
Bispectral index (BIS) to approximately 60 or less at 2 minutes after LoC. There were no apparent 
differences between the four induction doses in terms of BIS.  
The BIS value (mean) during anaesthesia maintenance was 51.2 to 77.0 in Part B (non-elderly), and 
44.8 to 71.0 in Part D (elderly). After the end of remimazolam administration, the BIS value (mean) 
increased  to  approximately  80,  which  generally  indicates  light  sedation  as  the  subjects  were 
awakening from the state of unconsciousness. 
All recovery times were slightly longer in non-elderly as compared to elderly patients. Eye opening 
occurred at a mean of 14/11 minutes and extubation at a mean of 16/14 minutes after the end of 
remimazolam administration in non-elderly and elderly patients, respectively. The mean time from 
end of study drug administration to being able to state date of birth was 21/18 minutes, and to being 
ready to be discharged was 26/19 minutes, in non-elderly and elderly patients, respectively.  
Assessment report  
EMA/79576/2023  
Page 26/129 
 
 
 
 
 
When interpreting these results it should be noted that somewhat higher doses were used during 
maintenance  in  non-elderly  as  compared  to  elderly  patients  (1 mg/kg/h  starting  dose  rate  was 
adjusted to 0.8 to 2.0 mg/kg/h in non-elderly and to 0.4 to 1.0 mg/kg/h in elderly subjects). In the 
vast majority of patients, the systolic blood pressure remained at or above 80mm Hg for the entire 
treatment phase. 
•  CNS7056-010:  a  monocentric  trial  conducted  in  Germany,  which  investigated  remimazolam 
(6 mg/kg/h and 12 mg/kg/h induction doses) versus propofol in the induction and maintenance of 
GA during cardiac surgery. All patients randomized to propofol received sevoflurane after intubation 
and prior to extracorporeal circulation. Not many data have been provided via this study, besides 
the fact it supported the choice of the lower studied dose: time to loss of consciousness was shorter 
for the higher dose (1.4 min) as compared to the lower dose (2.0 min), while haemodynamic stability 
was better for the lower dose (i.e. 35.3% cardiostability at 6 mg/kg/h vs. 17.9% cardiostability at 
12 mg/kg/h). Since haemodynamic stability is an important feature of remimazolam, the lower dose 
has been selected as the default induction dose. Since 12 mg/kg/h (considered largely equivalent to 
12 mg/min) was also safe and efficacious, 12 mg/min is proposed as an upper limit for the induction 
dose to be used in situations in which a fast induction could be needed. 
2.6.5.2  Main study(ies) 
Two  pivotal  Phase III  trials  (ONO-2745-05  and  CNS7056-022)  have  been  noted  for  the  indication 
being sought in this line extension application. 
CNS7056-022 
A phase III study comparing the safety and efficacy of remimazolam during GA in ASA III/IV 
patients 
Methods 
CNS7056-022  was  a  phase III  confirmatory  efficacy  and  safety  study  comparing  remimazolam  with 
propofol  for  IV  anaesthesia  during  elective  surgery  in  ASA III/IV  patients.  The  study  was  planned  to 
randomise 452 patients in total: 339 to remimazolam, 113 to propofol. An interim analysis was planned 
after 243 randomised patients. 
Study participants 
Key inclusion criteria: 
An individual had to meet all of the following criteria: 
• Male or female ASA III / IV patients, at least 18 years old, scheduled for an elective surgical procedure 
of a minimum duration of approximately 90 minutes under GA and planned to be extubated immediately 
post-operatively; 
•  Total  intravenous  GA  with  the  requirement  for  mechanical  ventilation  via  endotracheal  tube  and 
necessary invasive BP monitoring either due to severity of illness, severity of concomitant diseases, type 
of surgery or decisions of the anaesthesia staff. 
• Patients scheduled to stay in the hospital long enough after the surgical procedure to perform all trial 
follow-up procedures (~1 day); 
• For female patients of childbearing potential: Negative results of 2 pregnancy tests, the first test taken 
at the start of Screening and the second test taken shortly before the administration of the IMP as well 
as consent to use highly effective birth control from the last menstrual cycle prior to the start of the IMP 
until the end of the trial follow-up procedures.

Key exclusion criteria: 
An individual who met any of the following criteria was excluded from participation in this trial: 
•  Patients  scheduled  for  spinal  anaesthesia,  epidural  anaesthesia  (central  neuraxial  anaesthesia)  or 
regional  anaesthesia.  The  placement  of  a  peridural  catheter  with  a  test  dose  application  of  a  local 
anaesthetic drug (up to 5 mL) to verify correct positioning to achieve post-operative analgesia and the 
regional administration of local anaesthetic for post-operative analgesia after wound closure (after the 
last skin suture) was accepted; 
• Patients undergoing transplant surgery, cardiac surgery, or intracranial neurosurgery, patients which 
had to be in prone position for surgery, emergency surgery, or any surgical procedure with the need for 
or scheduled for post-operative ventilator support; 
•  Patients  undergoing  surgical  procedures  that  required  keeping  the  BP  at  a  high  level,  e.g.  surgical 
procedures in beach chair position; 
• Patients with severe hypertension, i.e., one baseline result of systolic BP 200 mmHg or more and/or 
diastolic  BP  of  120  mmHg  or  more.  Baseline  was  defined  as  the  time  after  signature  of  ICF  and 
beforearrival in the OR suite; 
• Patients with total bilirubin of ≥3.0 mg/dL or ≥3 times increase in aspartate aminotransferase or alanine 
aminotransferase as per the reference range, in laboratory tests which had to be checked within the 7 
days prior to start of IMP, or any other laboratory results that made the patient unsuitable for the trial; 
• Patients with end-stage renal disease requiring scheduled dialysis. 
Treatments 
The dosing of remimazolam and propofol during the first 20 minutes of the GA is detailed in the Table

induction schedule if the NCI was outside the intended range between ≥27 and ≤60 
The MAH excluded the first two patients in each study site because these patients were not randomised. 
This  will  not  mimic  the  real  life  approach,  where  clinicians  may  perform  differently  in  the  first 
anesthetised  patients  than  when  they  are  acquainted  with  the  product.  Therefore,  analysis  of  these 
patients was requested to:  
a)  As  intent  to  treat  where  all  patients  assigned  to  remimazolam  or  propofol  be  analysed  together, 
independently from having been randomised or not;  
b)  All  non-randomised  first  two  patients  in  each  study  site,  to  be  compared  to  those  randomised,  to 
understand  whether  the  learning  curve  for  remimazolam  was  different  from  what  clinicians  are 
accustomed to.  
The MAH performed the requested analyses:  
Assessment report  
EMA/79576/2023  
Page 28/129 
 
 
 
a) Regarding the ITT analysis, it is reassuring that the results show a similar trend which is statistically 
significant as compared to the primary analysis of the study;  
b) The MAH concludes there was a learning effect after the first patient, who became stable afterwards, 
due  to  the  easiness  of  remimazolam  use.  The  CHMP  reasoning  differs:  the  first  patient  was 
knowledgeably on propofol; all the others were either:  
1) Using an unknown product (second patient)  
2) They had a higher chance of being using an unknown product. Therefore they had to be much 
more cautious. This is in line with what is expected in the conduct of a trial, and apparently did 
not interfere with global study results. 
Objectives 
Study  CNS7056-022 was a confirmatory trial to establish: 
1. The primary objective of non-inferior efficacy of remimazolam;  
2.  The  key  secondary  objective  of  superior  haemodynamic  stability  associated  with  the  use  of 
remimazolam compared with propofol for induction and maintenance of GA during elective surgery in 
patients  in  ASA  classes  III  and  IV.  Further  endpoints  of  efficacy  and  safety  were  investigated  in  an 
exploratory manner. 
Outcomes / endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
• 
The percentage of time of NCI ≤60 during maintenance phase of GA, defined as time between 
the first skin incision and the completion of the last skin suture 
Key Secondary Endpoint (KSE) – safety endpoint 
•  Superiority  of  remimazolam  over  propofol  in  terms  of  the  KSE, i.e.  haemodynamic  instability, 
was defined as critical decrease(s) in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) between start of IMP 
and 15 minutes after the first skin incision. 
This was assessed using the total number of critical hypotensive events per patient and comparing the 
mean number of events of haemodynamic instability per patient between the 2 treatment groups. 
Each event from the following categories was counted and events were summed up per patient: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Incidence of MAP dropping below 65 mmHg for at least 1 minute duration 
Incidence of a MAP decrease of more than 20% below the calculated (mean) baseline MAP 
value for at least 1 minute duration 
Incidence of a MAP decrease of more than 30% below the calculated (mean) baseline MAP 
value for at least 1 minute duration 
Number of norepinephrine boluses (0.01 mg) required or, if an infusion was used to maintain 
MAP equal to or above 65 mmHg, then each time interval of 2 minutes duration of continuous 
norepinephrine infusion was counted as one event. 
Secondary endpoints 
• 
• 
• 
Time from start of IMP administration to LoC (i.e., MOAA/S = 0) 
The incidence of the occurrence of intra-operative awakening (explicit awareness)

Although the secondary outcomes include % of time of NCT in the desired range and in the undesirable 
range, the cut-off values are set lower than was proposed during Scientific Advice. Desired range was 
defined  as  NCI  ≤60  and  ≥27  (instead  of  between  60  and  40,  per  SA)  and  the  undesirable  range  was 
defined as NCI <27 (instead of below 40, per SA). The Applicant provided an in-depth answer to CHMP’s 
request  for  additional  analyses  with  the  secondary  outcomes  defined  per  Scientific  Advice 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/14117/2018), i.e. NCI between 60 and 40, together with reasons for not following 
the  mentioned  scientific  advice,  namely  the  lower  boundary  of  27  instead  of  40,  which  is  in  line  with 
present GA literature. The provided reasons are acceptable, and the additional analyses (namely with 
use  of  the  safety  set  population)  show  similar  results  in  remimazolam  and  propofol  arms,  which  is 
reassuring. 
Sample size 
It  was  planned  to  randomly  assign  452  patients  in  total:  339  to  remimazolam,  113  to  propofol.  In 
addition, the first two patients of each site were enrolled in the trial, but not included in the randomisation 
scheme. It was expected this process would result in a maximum total sample size of around 512 treated 
patients (452 randomised patients and approximately 60 non-randomised patients). 
The  sample  size  calculation  for  the  primary  endpoint  (non-inferiority  of  remimazolam  compared  to 
propofol) is based on the following assumptions: for a one-sided type I error rate of 0.025 and a target 
power of 90%, the assumption of a non-inferiority margin of 10% lead to sample sizes of 84 patients 
with an allocation ratio of 3:1 (63:21).  
The sample size calculation for the key secondary endpoint (superiority of remimazolam compared to 
propofol based on combined hemodynamic effect) is based on the following assumptions: for a two-sided 
type  I  error  rate  of  0.05  and  a  target  power  of  90%,  the  assumption  to  detect  a  difference  of  18.60 
hemodynamic events per subject (according to the composite key secondary endpoint) leads to a sample 
size of 324 patients with an allocation ratio of 3:1 (243:81 = 324).  
A 10% dropout rate is expected and therefore the sample size for the PEP is set to 93 subjects, while 
the sample size for the KSE is set to 356 (3:1 = 267:89) (which includes the before mentioned sample 
size for the PEP of 93 subjects). 
The trial was prematurely terminated due to a global health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, 
which led to postponement of elective surgeries and a substantial impairment of on-site monitoring due 
to access restrictions to hospitals. At the time of the premature termination, a total of 425 patients were 
enrolled by 23 sites. Of these 425 patients, 409 were exposed to the IMP, either after assignment to 
treatment  by  randomisation  (365  patients)  or  based  on  pre-planned  assignment  (44  patients).  The 
numbers of patients in the safety set (SAF), full analysis set (FAS), per protocol set 1 (PP1; relevant for 
the primary efficacy endpoint; PEP) and in the per protocol set 2 (PP2; relevant for the key secondary 
endpoint; KSE) are provided in the Table 5.

Table 5: Number of patients analyses 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
A  computer-generated  randomisation  schedule  was  prepared  before  the  start  of  the  trial,  using  an 
imbalanced randomisation scheme of 3:1 for remimazolam to propofol, stratified by the ASA status of 
the patient, ASA III and ASA IV. Screened patients are randomly allocated to one of the two treatment 
groups. 
Two  patients  per  site  are  enrolled  in  the  trial,  without  being  randomised,  so  that  site  personnel  can 
familiarise  themselves  with  trial  procedures  and  with  remimazolam.  They  are  pre-assigned  to  either 
propofol  (patient  1)  or  remimazolam  (patient  2)  and  their  complete  data  is  collected.  Randomisation 
starts with patient 3 of each site and occurs as shortly before the start of IMP as possible, i.e. Day 1 
preferably. In exceptional cases and for organisational reasons, randomisation can be done late on Day 
-1. 
The study was not blinded for investigators, but it was blinded for the patient and the statistician. 
Statistical methods 
This was a confirmatory trial to a) establish the primary objective of non-inferior efficacy of remimazolam 
compared  with  propofol  for  induction  and  maintenance  of  general  anaesthesia  (GA)  during  elective 
surgery and b) establish the key secondary objective of superior haemodynamic stability associated with 
the use of remimazolam compared with propofol for induction and maintenance of GA during elective 
surgery. 
The  FAS  was  defined  as  those  patients  who  were  randomised  and  who  received  the  trial  drug  for  ≥1 
minute. Patients pre-assigned to either propofol (patient 1 at each site) or remimazolam (patient 2 at 
each site) were not included in the FAS. The FAS was used for the sensitivity analysis of the primary 
endpoint,  for  the  primary  analysis  of  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  and  the  key  secondary  (safety) 
endpoint. 
The SAF was defined as all patients who received any amount of the trial drug. The SAF was used for all 
safety analyses except for the KSE. All patients were treated according to their assigned treatment. PK 
Set (PKS): Patients randomised to remimazolam were included in the PKS if they had at least 1 plasma 
concentration >lowest level of quantification (LLOQ), 4 analysable PK samples (Cmax and 3 subsequent 
points), a pre-dose plasma concentration ≤5% of Cmax, and had no major protocol deviations that may 
have impacted reliability of PK data. 
The PP1 consisted of all patients in the FAS who had no major protocol deviations preventing the accurate 
and sufficient evaluation of the PEP. The PP1 was used for the primary analysis of the primary endpoint.

The PP2 consisted of all patients in the FAS who had no major protocol deviations preventing the accurate 
and sufficient evaluation of the KSE. The PP2 was used for the sensitivity analysis of the key secondary 
endpoint. 
Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint 
The main analysis of the PEP (non-inferiority) was conducted on the PP1 Set at the IA using NCT data 
after  imputations  of  missing  NCI  values  for  time  periods  of  up  to  300  seconds  with  linear  regression 
using one value before and after missing values. Missing NCI values for time periods of over 300 seconds 
were not imputed. 
The clinical equivalence (non-inferiority) of remimazolam compared with propofol in terms of the PEP (% 
of time of NCI ≤60) was assessed using a non-inferiority test that was a one-sided two sample t-test that 
compared the differences to a non-zero quantity M (non-inferiority margin of 10%). 
The null and alternative hypotheses were, when the higher values were better: 
•  H0: (μT-μC) ≤ - M 
•  H1: (μT-μC) > - M 
This percentage of time with NCI ≤60 was compared between  subjects who received remimazolam or 
propofol  using  a  one-sided  two  sample  t-test  at  a significance  level  of  0.025.  Results  were  presented 
along with the lower bound of a 97.5% CI. As a sensitivity analysis, an ANCOVA model including patient’s 
ASA physical status (ASA III or ASA IV) and treatment as covariates was performed. 
Analysis of the key secondary endpoint 
The main analysis of the KSE (superiority) was conducted on the FAS population using MAP results from 
invasive blood pressure monitoring by FloTrac® after imputation of missing MAP results for time periods 
up to 180 seconds with linear regression using one value before and after missing values. Missing MAP 
results for time periods of over 180 seconds were not imputed. 
Superiority of remimazolam over propofol in terms of the KSE, i.e. haemodynamic instability, was defined 
as critical decrease(s) in MAP between start of IMP and 15 minutes after the first skin incision. 
This  was  assessed  using  the  total  number  of  pre-defined  critical  hypotensive  events  per  patient  and 
comparing the mean number of events of haemodynamic instability per patient between the 2 treatment 
groups. 
The KSE was compared in subjects who received remimazolam or propofol. It was planned to use a 2-
sided  z-test.  The  KSE  was  tested  at  a  2-sided  significance  level  of  0.05,  using  the  O’Brien-Fleming 
spending function to determine the test boundaries for the 2 sequential tests (at the IA with 243 patients 
and at the FA). The 2-sided type I error rate was 0.0193 at the IA and 0.0307 at the FA. Results were 
presented along with a 98.07% CI at the IA and with a 96.93% CI and p-value at the FA. As a sensitivity 
analysis, an ANCOVA model including patient’s ASA physical status (ASA III or ASA IV) and treatment 
as covariates were calculated at the IA and at the FA. 
The KSE was analysed using the following hypotheses: 
•  H0: μRemimazolam = μPropofol and 
•  H1: μRemimazolam < μPropofol 
where μ described the mean number of haemodynamic events (hypotension) per patient. 
During  the  statistical  analysis  of  the  KSE,  it  was  found  that  the  endpoint  variable  was  not  normally 
distributed.  Hence,  the  z-test  was  replaced  with  a  Wilcoxon  rank-sum  test.  Moreover,  due  to  the 
Assessment report

Page 32/129 
 
 
 
intercomponent correlation of the components of the composite KSE, the endpoint had to be factored 
using the Common Factor Analysis (CFA) in order to be based on the most important factors from the 
statistical and medical perspective. For the analysis of the non-normally distributed factored endpoint, 
the z-test was replaced by the more appropriate Wilcoxon rank-sum test. 
The statistical considerations regarding the post-hoc change of analysis for the key secondary outcome 
(haemodynamic instability) is presented in the Results section. 
Stopping rules at the interim analysis 
The stopping rules at the IA comprised the following options: 
1.  PEP non-inferiority shown, KSE superiority not shown: Continue to the planned number of trial 
patients 
2.  PEP  non-inferiority  shown,  KSE  superiority  shown:  Continue  to  the  planned  number  of  trial 
patients with open label remimazolam only 
3.  PEP non-inferiority not shown, KSE regardless of result: Stop trial

In  total,  425  patients  were  assigned  to  remimazolam  or  propofol  either  by  randomisation  or  by  fixed 
assignment, depending on whether they were the first or second trial patient of a trial site. 
Of 425 patients with assignment to remimazolam or propofol at a total of 23 trial sites, 16 patients were 
not exposed to IMP due to reasons emerging between assignment and planned start of IMP, e.g. surgery 
cancelled/postponed.  Among  the  remaining  409  patients,  365  patients  had  been  assigned  to 
remimazolam or propofol by randomisation, while 44 patients were among the first two patients of each 
individual site, hence were assigned to propofol or remimazolam depending on whether they were the 
first or the second patient of this site. 
The trial was completed, according to the protocol, by 364 patients on remimazolam or propofol based 
on  randomised  assignment,  and  by  42  patients  on  remimazolam  or  propofol  as  consequence  of  pre-
planned assignment. Early withdrawal after any exposure to IMP occurred in three patients.

Recruitment 
The first patient’s first visit (FPFV) was performed on 22 July 2018 and the last patient’s last visit (LPLV) 
was performed on 18 March 2020. The trial was prematurely terminated on 02 April 2020, due to the 
global COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 23 sites in Europe contributed patients to the trial. The trial sites 
were  in  Belgium  (three  sites),  Switzerland  (four  sites),  Germany  (six  sites),  France  (two  sites),  The 
Netherlands (two sites), Italy (three sites) and the UK (three sites). 
Conduct of the study 
During Blind Data Review Meetings (BDRMs) prior to the IA and the FA, and before statistical tables by 
actual treatment group were produced, protocol deviations were reviewed in order to define the analysis 
populations. 
Among all protocol deviations that had the potential to interfere with the evaluation of the PEP and the 
KSE,  inappropriate  use  of  rescue  sedative  medication  was  assessed  as  particularly  important.  It  was 
defined as the use of: 
•  Sedatives/hypnotics  other  than  the  allocated  IMP  (remimazolam  or  propofol)  or  ketamine  at  an 
analgesic dose, without prior administration of the IMP dose to the maximum allowed by the protocol; 
•  Higher doses of IMP than the allowed by the protocol without prior increase of the IMP dose to the 
maximum allowed by the protocol. 
Patients were included into the FAS following the definition provided in the protocol and the SAP with 
only  one  exception:  one  patient  was  excluded  from  the  FAS  despite  the  fact  that  the  IMP  was 
administered over at least one minute, because desflurane and IMP were started together inadvertently, 
due to the desflurane container remaining open from the preceding GA in the same room. The local trial 
team detected this error only after a few minutes of application of the IMP (together with desflurane). 
The  PP1  and  PP2  were  identified  as  part  of  the  preparation  of  the  IA  and  FA  taking  into  account  all 
protocol deviations that prevented an appropriate evaluation of the PEP and the KSE. The most frequent 
protocol deviations causing exclusion from the PP1 at both analysis time points were inappropriate use 
of  rescue  sedative  medication  (IA:  10  [3.9%]  patients;  FA:  16  [4.4%]  patients)  and  incorrect  use  of 
post-operative  analgesia  (IA:  8  [3.1%]  patients,  FA:  8  [2.2%]  patients).  The  most  frequent  protocol 
deviations causing exclusion from the PP2 at both analysis time points were remifentanil dosed too high 
during  the  time  of  interest  (TOI)  (IA:  54  [21.3%]  patients;  FA:  69  [18.9%]  patients)  and  FloTrac® 
started after first IMP dose (IA: 10 [3.9%] patients, FA: 14 [3.8%] patients). 
PP1 and especially PP2 analyses are expected to significantly deviate from the real treatment response 
since  over  1/4  of  the  patients  end  up  being  removed  from  the  analysis,  and  the  behaviour  of  those 
removed is likely different from the one in the per protocol analyses. 
Protocol deviations leading to exclusion from the PP1 and PP2 sets are provided in the Table 6:

No  particular  concerns  arise  from  these  exclusions,  with  the  exception  of  remifentanil  high  dose  as  a 
reason for exclusion from PP2 (at interim analysis: 23% in remimazolam and 15.9% in propofol; at final 
analysis: 21.1% in remimazolam and 12.6% in propofol) was raised as a concern. The MAH found no 
apparent explanation for the observed difference (remifentanil high dose as a reason for exclusion from 
PP2 was observed with a notably higher frequency for remimazolam arm compared to propofol arm). 
However, the MAH provided several arguments which could have contributed to the observed difference 
in frequencies. This argumentation is considered acceptable and it can be agreed that a key reason for 
the difference does not emerge from the presented data. 
Protocol amendments 
One protocol amendment for Germany only and three global protocol amendments occurred. Protocol 
amendment  for  Germany  only  and  the  first  global  protocol  amendment  occurred  before  FPFV  and 
therefore did not impact the study results.  
The second and third global protocol amendments include many minor changes. A clarification on the 
impact of amendments was requested and duly provided by the MAH. 
Baseline data 
At  their  individual  trial  start  and  based  on  the  FAS,  patients  in  the  remimazolam  group  were  68.3  ± 
10.83 (mean ± standard deviation) years old and patients in the propofol group were 68.3 ± 10.21 years 
old. The majority of patients in both groups were male (remimazolam: 72.2%, propofol: 73.7%). The 
mean BMI was 27.8 ± 5.30 kg/m2 in the remimazolam group and 27.0 ± 5.29 kg/m2 in the propofol 
group. The ASA class was specified as ASA III for 95.6% of the patients in the remimazolam group and 
93.7% of the patients in the propofol group. All other patients were assessed as ASA IV.  
Across the GA studies conducted, the average BMI was similar across the remimazolam and propofol 
groups (see Table 7). In 2014, the global age-standardised mean BMI was 24·2 kg/m2 (24·0–24·4 
{95% credible interval}) in men, and 24·4 kg/m2 (24·2–24·6 {95% credible interval}) in women. 
Therefore, the mean BMI observed across the GA studies was slightly higher than the global average. 
Table 7: Mean BMI in Group C 
Remimazolam (n = 783) 
Propofol (n = 226) 
Mean BMI (SD) 
25.22 (4.612) 
25.98 (4.965) 
Across all propofol controlled studies the BMI was comparable across the remimazolam and propofol 
groups). Across the Japanese studies the means of BMI ranged from 22.70 – 23.25 within the 
remimazolam group. This is largely similar to the mean BMI in Japan.
Looking at the mean BMI across all GA studies, there is a clear trend for lower BMI in patients in 
Japanese studies in comparison to patients in European studies. In European studies the means of the 
BMI ranged from 26.25 – 27.74 within the remimazolam group. This is consistent with the average BMI 
seen in many major European countries e.g., Germany (26.3) and the UK (27.3), but slightly higher 
than the average BMI in Italy (26.0), Netherlands (25.4) and Belgium (25.5), all countries which 
contributed to the European GA development program. 
Across the two pivotal studies ONO-2745-05 and CNS7056-022 the difference in BMI across Japanese 
patients and European patients was consistent with the average BMI across these territories, as 
outlined by the 2014 Global status report on noncommunicable diseases. In addition, as the question 
highlights, a higher BMI is expected in ASA III/IV patients. As ONO-2745-05 included ASA I/II patients 
and CNS7056-022 included ASA III/IV patients a higher BMI is expected to be seen in the latter. 
Assessment report  
EMA/79576/2023  
Page 37/129 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It can therefore be concluded that the BMI of the patients included in the GA development program is 
representative of the population within the EU. In addition, as remimazolam will generally be 
administered by body weight independent dosing, extremes in BMI are unlikely to have any significant 
impact on the dose administered.  It can also be accepted that, as par as the EU population is 
concerned, observed differences between the studied population and the broad EU population may not 
have clinical relevance for most GA aspects. 
Medical History 
Any past medical history was reported by 215 (79.6%) patients in the remimazolam group and by 80 
(84.2%) patients in the propofol group. The highest by-patient frequency emerged for the SOC surgical 
and medical procedures (53.7% of the patients in the remimazolam group and 51.6% of the patients in 
the propofol group). The SOC with the second highest by-patient frequency was neoplasms (18.1% of 
the patients in the remimazolam group and 16.8% of the patients in the propofol group). The PTs most 
often reported were myocardial infarction (6.3% of the patients in the remimazolam group and 11.6% 
of the patients in the propofol group) and appendicectomy (6.3% of the patients in the remimazolam 
group and 5.3% of the patients in the propofol group). 
Current Medical Conditions 
Any  current  medical  condition  was  reported  by  all  (100.0%)  patients  in  both  treatment  groups.  The 
highest  by-patient  frequency  was  found  for  the  SOC  vascular  disorders  (75.9%  of  the  patients  in  the 
remimazolam group and 78.9% of the patients in the propofol group). The SOC with the second highest 
by-patient frequency was metabolism and nutrition disorders (52.6% of the patients in the remimazolam 
group and 46.3% of the patients in the propofol group). The PTs reported most often were hypertension 
(67.4% of the patients in the remimazolam group and 69.5% of patients in the propofol group) and type 
2 diabetes mellitus (15.6% of the patients in the remimazolam group and 9.5% of the patients in the 
propofol group). 
Prior and Concomitant Medication 
In both treatment groups and based on the SAF, prior medication was most frequently from the ATC 
classes cardiovascular system (84.2% of the patients in the remimazolam group, 84.7% of the patients 
in the propofol group), blood and blood forming organs (70.4% of the patients in the remimazolam group 
and 69.5% of the patients in the propofol group), and alimentary tract and metabolism (62.2% of the 
patients in the remimazolam group and 63.6% of the patients in the propofol group). Benzodiazepine 
derivates were reported as prior medication for one (0.3%) patient in the remimazolam group and four 
(3.4%) patients in the propofol group. 
In both treatment groups and based on the SAF, concomitant medication was most often from the classes 
nervous  system  (97.3%  of  the  patients  in  the  remimazolam  group  and  97.5%  of  the  patients  in  the 
propofol group), alimentary tract and metabolism (75.6% of the patients in the remimazolam group and 
68.6% of the patients in the propofol group), and anti-infectives for systemic use (72.5% of the patients 
in the remimazolam group and 68.6% of the patients in the propofol group. 
The documentation of either type 2 DM or DM in the patients’ medical history was at the discretion of 
the investigator. Therefore, even though patients within the group type 2 DM only includes those patients 
who suffer with type 2 DM, the DM group includes patients who suffer with any type of diabetes, including 
type 2 DM. At this moment it is not possible to further discriminate DM patients and understand which 
might be at higher risk of AEs. 
In the trial CNS7056-022, patients with regular use of central nervous system depressant drugs were 
excluded.  However,  subgroup  analyses  on  patients  with  or  without  reported  non-single  use  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/79576/2023  
Page 38/129 
 
 
 
benzodiazepines,  opioids,  antidepressants,  antiepileptics  and/or  hypnotics  and  sedatives  revealed 
differences between the subgroups in terms of the effect of remimazolam. 
The MAH provided data on patients on chronic treatment with CNS depressants, in spite of the exclusion 
criteria stringency on chronic BZD use. Although the sample was very low (40 pts) compared to those 
with  no  CNS  depressant  (251  pts)  -  and  therefore  a  significant  statistical  difference  was  not  to  be 
expected - there was a clear numerically difference among the patients treated with CNS depressants, 
in:  
a) decreased duration of remimazolam sedative effect (NCI ≤60);  
b) increased absolute dose of remimazolam per procedure;  
c) increased dose per hour;  
d) increased need for rescue sedation. 
Given  that  all  aspects  studied  point  towards  a  significant  risk  of  decreased  efficacy  in  patients 
concomitantly treated with CNS depressants, the MAH included a specific warning in the SmPC and refer 
not only to chronic use of BZDs but to “CNS depressants”, as requested by CHMP. It should be clear for 
the HCP that acute concomitant use of CNS depressants may increase sedation but, on the other hand, 
chronic concomitant use of CNS depressants may decrease remimazolam sedation. Therefore, in Section 
4.4 of SmPC, the heading was revised from “Chronic benzodiazepine use” to “Chronic CNS depressants 
use”  and  the  text  below  included:  patients  who  receive  chronic  benzodiazepine  therapy  (e.g.,  for 
insomnia or anxiety disorders) may develop tolerance to the sedative/hypnotic effects of remimazolam. 
Hence,  a  larger  cumulative  dose  of  remimazolam  may  be  required  to  achieve  the  desired  level  of 
anaesthesia. A similar effect may also be observed with other CNS depressants. It is recommended to 
follow the titration regimen in section 4.2 and titrate up based on the patient’s response, until the desired 
depth of anaesthesia is achieved (see section 4.5).

Outcomes and estimation 
The  PEP  analysis  was  conducted  on  the  per  protocol  set  of  the  interim  analysis.  The  mean  difference 
between the treatment groups was -4.24 with a lower boundary of the 97.5% CI of -7.48. This lower 
boundary did not exceed the pre-defined threshold of -10. The corresponding p-value did not exceed the 
threshold  of  0.025.  Hence,  the  results  indicated  an  efficacy  of  remimazolam  that  was  non-inferior  to 
propofol in terms of the PEP. 
Interim analysis  
Primary efficacy endpoint 
To  account  for  missing  NCI  results  during  the  maintenance  phase  of  the  GA,  several  methods  were 
applied as per the SAP. The mean percentage of time with NCI ≤60 between first skin incision and last 
skin suture was 94.62% ± 19.337% in the PP1 remimazolam group (n = 165) and 98.86% ± 5.153% 
in the PP1 propofol group (n = 60). See Table 9. 
Table 9: Primary Efficacy Endpoint, Confirmatory Analysis (IA, PP1) 
The mean difference between the treatment groups was -4.24 with a lower boundary of the 97.5% CI 
of -7.48. This lower boundary did not exceed the pre-defined threshold of -10. The corresponding p = 
0.0003 did not exceed the threshold of 0.025. Hence, the results indicated an efficacy of remimazolam 
that was non-inferior to propofol in terms of the PEP. Exploratory sensitivity analyses showed that the 
pre-defined threshold of -10 for the lower boundary of the CI was met by analyses based on the PP1 and 
the FAS without imputations. The analysis based on the FAS and imputations based on linear regression 
yielded a mean difference between the treatment groups of -6.66 with a lower boundary of the 97.5% 
CI of -10.1 (see Table 10).

Table 10: Primary Efficacy Endpoint, Exploratory Sensitivity Analyses (IA) 
Key Secondary Endpoint 
To  account  for  missing  MAP  results  during  the  TOI  of  the  KSE,  several  methods  of  calculation  were 
applied. The results for the KSE at the IA indicated a tendency for smaller numbers and lower variance 
of  critical  hypotensive  events  under  remimazolam.  According  to  the  statistical  planning,  a  difference 
between the treatment groups was not shown: The actual p-value of 0.1002 exceeded the pre-defined 
type  1  error  at  0.0193.  Therefore,  recruitment  of  patients  and  randomized  assignment  to  propofol  or 
remimazolam was continued in line with the group sequential design (see Table 11).

The results for the KSE at the IA after transformation and based on the CFA are as follows:

Final Analysis 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
Summary statistics on the TOI for the PEP (i.e. the duration of the maintenance phase of the GA defined 
as time from the first skin incision to the last skin suture) yielded no differences between the treatment 
groups (see Table 13). 
Table 13: Duration of Time of Interest (TOI) for the Primary Efficacy Endpoint (FA) 
At  the  FA,  the  mean  percentage  of  time  with  NCI  ≤60  was  95.48  ±  16.924  in  the  PP1  remimazolam 
group (n = 235) and 99.07 ± 4.231 in the PP1 propofol group (n = 92). A mean difference of -3.59 with 
a lower bound of the 97.5% CI of -5.93 resulted. Hence, the FA results supported the results from the 
IA. All FA results based on the primary analysis method (PP1, imputations by linear regression) and the 
sensitivity analyses methods. 
Analyses of covariance did not indicate any impact on the results based on the ASA class or the type of 
surgery. Summary statistics on the amount of remifentanil used during the TOI for the PEP did not show 
a clinically relevant difference between the treatment groups. 
Key Secondary Endpoint 
The mean duration of the TOI (i.e. start of IMP until 15 min after skin incision) by treatment group was 
calculated prior to the analysis of the KSE (see Table 14). 
Assessment report  
EMA/79576/2023  
Page 42/129 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 14: Duration of Time of Interest for the Key Secondary Endpoint (FA, FAS) 
There was no difference between the two treatment groups of the FAS in terms of the TOI for the KSE. 
Therefore, adjustment to duration of the TOI for the KSE as outlined in SAP was not required. The same 
applied to the PP2. 
The FA of the KSE as described in the protocol yielded mean numbers of events of 61.92 ± 38.115 in 
the FAS remimazolam group and 71.03 ± 41.123 in the FAS propofol group. A 2-sided z test yielded a 
p-value of 0.0585. 
The results for the KSE after the CFA are shown below: 
Table 15: Key Secondary Endpoint, Confirmatory Analysis after Common Factor Analysis (FA, 
FAS) 
The actual p-value = 0.0151 was below the pre-defined type 1 error at 0.0307 for the FA, so that the 
null  hypothesis  was  rejected  at  the  FA.  Superiority  of  remimazolam  over  propofol  regarding 
haemodynamic stability in terms of the KSE was proven.

NCI ≤60 and ≥27 During Maintenance 
The  percentage  of  time  with  NCI  ≤60  and  ≥27  during  the  maintenance  (first  skin  incision  to  last  skin 
suture)  was  higher  in  the  propofol  group  than  in  the  remimazolam  group  based  on  the  FAS.  This 
difference was smaller in the PP1. 
For the time with NCI ≤60 and ≥27 During Maintenance (FAS) see Table 19.

The mean percentage of time of the GA with NCI <27 during maintenance (first skin incision to last skin 
suture) indicated no substantial differences between the treatment groups for the FAS and for the PP1.

NCI ≤60 and ≥27 During 90% of Maintenance 
The percentage of patients with NCI ≤60 and ≥27 during 90% of maintenance (first skin incision to last 
skin suture) was higher in the propofol group than in the remimazolam group. The difference between 
the treatment groups was similar for the FAS and the PP1. 
Rescue Sedative Medication 
Including Use of Rescue Sedative Medication Not Per Protocol During PEP TOI The proportion of patients 
receiving rescue sedative medication between the first skin incision and last skin suture, i.e. TOI for the 
PEP, was higher in the remimazolam group than in the propofol group based on the FAS, i.e. including 
use of rescue sedative medication that did not follow the protocol definitions (see Tables below)

Use of Rescue Sedative Medication During Other Time Intervals 
Results were in line with the results for the time interval relevant for the PEP. Analyses of the use of 
rescue sedative medication between start of IMP and last skin suture yielded results that were similar to 
those for the TOI of the PEP and the KSE. 
Other Sedative Medication 
The  proportion  of  patients  receiving  sedative  medication  that  did  not  meet  the  definition  of  rescue 
sedative medication between the first skin incision and the last skin suture (TOI for the PEP), regardless 
of the reason, was higher in the remimazolam group than in the propofol group based on the FAS. 
Any Other Sedative Medication Between First Skin Incision and Last Skin Suture, Regardless of Reason 
(FAS) is noted in the Table 25.

Intra-operative Awakening and Explicit Awareness 
A series of signs were reported by the investigators as potential signs of intra-operative awakening for 
50 (18.5%) patients in the remimazolam group and 7 (7.4%) patients in the propofol group. 
Explicit awareness during the GA was detected for none of the patients in both treatment groups during 
a  review  of  the  answers  provided  to  the  Brice  questionnaire  by  an  expert  who  was  blinded  regarding 
treatment group assignment.

Onset of Effect 
The time to loss of consciousness, time to loss of palpebral reflex and to first NCI ≤60 were measured 
from the start time of the IMP and were analysed using the Kaplan Meier method. Missing data for the 
time of loss of consciousness and/or time of loss of palpebral reflex in a small number of patients resulted 
in censoring at the first skin incision, as defined in the SAP. 
Time to Loss of Consciousness 
The median time from start of IMP to loss of consciousness was similar in both treatment groups of the 
FAS (see Table 26).

Offset of Effect 
For the parameters representing the offset of the effect of the IMP, censoring rules were defined in the 
SAP.  In  addition  to  these  rules,  availability  of  data,  the  use  of  rescue  sedative  medication  or  other 
sedative medication and the use of flumazenil were taken into account. 
Time to Extubation 
The median time from stop of IMP to end of extubation differed by 1 minute between the remimazolam 
group and the propofol group, which translated into a p-value below 0.05 based on testing by a 2-sided 
log rank test. No clinical relevance was assigned (see Table 28).

Satisfaction with IMP 
Overall satisfaction with the IMP was to be assessed on a scale between 1 and 10 where 1 equalled ‘‘very 
dissatisfied with IMP’ and 10 equalled ‘very satisfied with IMP’. The proportion of assessments from 8 to 
10 inclusively was similar in both treatment groups. 
All Haemodynamic Events During General Anaesthesia 
Between the start of the study drug and the last skin suture, event type 1  (i.e. a drop  of MAP below 
65 mmHg)  was  of  similar  frequency  in  both  groups.  Event  type  4  (use  of  norepinephrine)  was  less 
frequent in the remimazolam group than in the propofol group during the time from start of the study 
drug  to  the  last  skin  suture.  These  results  were  in  line  with  general  expectations  as  investigators

ONO-2745-05 
A Phase IIb/III study comparing remimazolam with propofol in patients undergoing 
surgery with GA Trial Design 
Methods 
ONO-2745-05  was  a  randomized,  parallel-group,  confirmatory  non-inferiority  study  of  remimazolam 
compared with propofol in surgical patients, ASA class I or II undergoing GA. Patients were allocated to 
one  of  three  treatment  groups;  two  remimazolam  groups  or  one  propofol  control  group.  The 
remimazolam groups differed in terms of the dose to be administered for induction (6 mg/kg/h or 12 
mg/kg/h). Subjects were blinded (single-blind) to treatment allocation and investigators were blinded 
(double-blind) to the dose of remimazolam for induction.  
Study Participants 
A total of 325 surgical  patients undergoing GA were planned to be enrolled, 260 in the remimazolam 
groups (130 per group) and 65 patients in the propofol group.

For  induction  of  anaesthesia  patients  randomized  to  remimazolam  received  6  or  12 mg/kg/h  by 
continuous IV infusion until loss of consciousness. After loss of consciousness, the dose was reduced to 
1 mg/kg/h. During maintenance, the infusion rate was adjusted as appropriate (maximum allowed dose, 
2 mg/kg/h) based on monitoring of the general condition and BIS values of individual subjects until the 
end of the surgery. 
In  the  propofol  group,  the  drug  was  administered  as  a  slow  bolus  at  a  dose  of  0.2-0.25 mL/kg  (2.0–
2.5 mg/kg of propofol) for induction of anaesthesia. After loss of consciousness, continuous IV infusion 
at a dose of 0.4–1 mL/kg/h (4–10 mg/kg/h of propofol) was started, after which the infusion rate was 
adjusted  as  appropriate  based  on  monitoring  of  the  general  condition  and  BIS  values  of  individual 
subjects until the end of the surgery. 
Propofol was used as per local SmPC.

This was a multicentre (49 sites, all in Japan), randomized, parallel-group comparison study with three 
treatment groups (two ONO-2745 groups and one propofol control group, in surgical patients undergoing 
GA). Enrolment was centralized. The allocation to either ONO-2745 or propofol was not rater-blinded, 
but subjects were blinded (single-blind), while the allocation to either of the two ONO-2745 groups (i.e., 
the 6 mg/kg/h group and the 12 mg/kg/h group) for induction of anesthesia was double-blinded.  
Duration: 1 day for the treatment period and 1 day for the follow-up period 
Dose 
•  ONO-2745 groups (i.e. RMZ) 
Remimazolam was administered at a dose of 6 or 12 mg/kg/h by continuous intravenous infusion 
until  loss  of  consciousness.  After  loss  of  consciousness,  continuous  intravenous  infusion  of  the 
investigational product at a dose of 1 mg/kg/h was started, after which the infusion rate was adjusted 
as appropriate (maximum allowed dose, 2 mg/kg/h) based on monitoring of the general condition 
of individual subjects until the end of the surgery. 
• 
Propofol group 
Propofol was administered as a slow bolus at a dose of 0.2–0.25 mL/kg (2.0–2.5 mg/kg of propofol). 
After loss of consciousness, continuous intravenous infusion of the investigational product at a typical 
dose of 0.4–1 mL/kg/h (4–10 mg/kg/h of propofol) was started, after which the infusion rate was 
adjusted as appropriate based on monitoring of the general condition of individual subjects until the 
end of the surgery. 
Objectives 
To  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  remimazolam  in  induction  and  maintenance  of  GA  in  surgical 
patients undergoing general anesthesia compared to propofol. 
To verify the non-inferiority of remimazolam to propofol in terms of “functional capability as a general 
anaesthetic”  on  the  basis  of  a  composite  of  three  primary  efficacy  variables,  which  comprise 
“intraoperative awakening or recall,” “requirement of rescue sedation with other sedatives” and “body 
movement.” 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint was the “functional capability as a general anesthetic,” as assessed on the basis 
of a composite of three variables specified below. In individual subjects, the investigational product was 
assessed as “effective” if all three variables were absent or “ineffective” if at least one of these three 
variables was present. 
• 
Intraoperative awakening or recall; 
•  Requirement of rescue sedation with other sedatives; 
•  Body movement; 
To assess non-inferiority, the lower limit of the confidence interval for the difference (1) between the 
remimazolam 12 mg/kg/h group and the propofol group, and (2) between the remimazolam 6 mg/kg/h 
group  and  the  propofol  group,  was  assessed  against  the  pre-  defined  lower  margin  of  −10%.  Non-
Assessment report

inferiority was to be determined if the lower limit of the confidence interval for the difference was greater 
than −10%. 
The primary endpoint was clinically based, and therefore different from the other pivotal study.  
Secondary endpoints 
1) Time to loss of consciousness from the start of investigational product administration 
2) Intraoperative awakening or recall 
3) Requirement of rescue sedation with other sedatives 
4) Body movement 
5) BIS value at each time point of evaluation 
6) Time to awakening from the end of investigational product administration 
7) Time to extubation from the end of investigational product administration 
8) Time to stating date of birth from the end of investigational product administration 
9) Time to decision to exit the operating room from the end of investigational product administration 
10) Controllability of anaesthetic depth 
Safety 
•  Adverse events 
•  Adverse reactions 
•  General laboratory tests (i.e., haematology, biochemistry, urinalysis)

Sample size 
•  325 subjects in total (260 subjects in RMZ groups [130 per group], 65 subjects in the propofol 
group); 
•  Numbers of subjects aged 65 years or older were to be ≥40 for each of the RMZ groups and ≥20 
for the propofol group. 
Rationale for the sample size 
Assessment report  
EMA/79576/2023  
Page 62/129 
 
 
 
Assuming an efficacy rate of 96% for each of RMZ groups and the propofol group, with a non-inferiority 
margin of 10%, a one-sided significance level of 2.5%, and 90% power, the sample size was calculated 
to observe a greater than -10% lower limit for the 95% confidence interval of the intergroup difference 
between each of the two RMZ groups (i.e., the 6 mg/kg/h group and the 12 mg/kg/h group) and the 
propofol group. Confidence intervals were to be calculated using the Wilson method. 
On  the  basis  of  the  above,  and  randomization  of  subjects  to  each  of  the  RMZ  groups  or  the  propofol 
group being at a ratio of 2:1, the required sample size was calculated to be 118 subjects for each of the 
RMZ groups and 59 subjects for the propofol group. To allow for approximately 10% discontinuations or 
dropouts, the sample size was set to 130 subjects for each of the RMZ groups and 65 subjects for the 
propofol  group.  In  addition,  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  RMZ  in  a  patient  population  that 
includes elderly subjects, given that elderly individuals are generally more likely to suffer sedative effects 
and adverse reactions such as decreased blood pressure and respiratory depression compared with non-
elderly individuals in this study, the numbers of subjects aged ≥65 years had to be at least 36 for each 
of the RMZ groups and ≥18 for the propofol group. To allow for approximately 10% discontinuations or 
dropouts, the numbers of subjects aged ≥65 years to be enrolled in the study were set to ≥40 for each 
of the RMZ group and ≥20 for the propofol group. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
The investigator or sub-investigator confirmed the eligibility of each subject who provided consent.  
The investigator, sub-investigator or clinical research coordinator then contacted the Patient Registration 
Center and requested enrolment of the subject.  
The Patient Registration Center randomized eligible subjects to one of the RMZ groups (6 or 12 mg/kg/h 
group) or the propofol group using a dynamic allocation method. The Center then notified the investigator 
or  sub-investigator,  the  sponsor,  and  the  unblinded  monitor  appointed  by  the  sponsor  of  the 
randomization results, i.e., either the drug number, for subjects allocated to RMZ groups (e.g., “ONO-
2745, No. X”), or the allocation of the subject to the propofol group. 
Subjects  meeting  all  inclusion  criteria,  and  not  meeting  any  exclusion  criteria,  were  randomized  by 
dynamic allocation using a minimization method and utilizing the following adjustment factors: 
1.  Age (20 to <65 years vs. ≥65 years); 
2.  ASA Class (I vs. II); 
3.  Any  planned  use  of  local  anesthesia  during  the  surgery  (spinal  subarachnoid  anesthesia,  epidural 
anesthesia or peripheral nerve block) (Yes vs. No); 
4.  Study site. 
Blinding (masking) 
The participants in this study were blinded, while the anaesthesiologists in charge of general anaesthesia 
were not blinded. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
The primary analysis set for efficacy evaluations was the Full Analysis Set (FAS). The Per Protocol Set 
(PPS) was used as the secondary analysis set. 
Assessment report  
EMA/79576/2023  
Page 63/129 
 
 
 
The  analysis  set  for  safety  evaluations  was  the  Safety  Set  (SAF).  However,  safety  information  was 
reported for all subjects treated with the investigational product. 
Analysis of efficacy 
Primary endpoint 
The rate of efficacy in terms of the primary endpoint was calculated for each treatment group. For each 
of the RMZ groups, the two-sided  95% confidence interval for the difference from the propofol group 
was calculated. To assess non-inferiority, the lower limit of the confidence interval for the difference (1) 
between the RMZ 12 mg/kg/h group and the propofol group, and (2) between the RMZ 6 mg/kg/h group 
and the propofol group, was assessed against the predefined lower margin of −10%. Non-inferiority was 
to be determined if the lower limit of the confidence interval for the difference was greater than −10%. 
If the first comparison of “(1)” failed to demonstrate non-inferiority, the second comparison of “(2)” was 
not to be performed. 
Secondary endpoints 
1) For each of the efficacy endpoints; 2) to 4), the rate of efficacy in each treatment group was calculated.  
In  addition,  for  differences  between  each  of  the  RMZ  groups  and  the  propofol  group  and  differences 
between  the  12  mg/kg/h  group  and  the  6  mg/kg/h  group,  two-sided  95%confidence  intervals  were 
calculated and compared using a chi-square test. 
2) For the efficacy endpoints 1), 6), 7), 8), and 9), summary statistics for each treatment group were 
calculated.  In  addition,  for  differences  between  each  of  the  RMZ  groups  and  the  propofol  group  and 
differences between the 12 mg/kg/h group and the 6 mg/kg/h group, two-sided 95% confidence intervals 
were calculated and compared using a t-test. 
3) For efficacy endpoint 5), summary statistics for each treatment group were calculated at each time 
point of evaluation. 
4) For efficacy endpoint 10), frequency distribution for each treatment group was calculated.

Conduct of the study 
Changes to the study 
The protocol was amended only once (on 09 Oct 2012) and the modification included descriptions for 
dosage and administration of propofol. 
No changes were made to assessment variables or to major analytical plans for this study. 
Protocol deviations 
The  investigational  product  was  not  administered  to  16  subjects  (i.e.,  eight  subjects  in  the  RMZ  6 
mg/kg/h  group,  six  subjects  in  the  ONO-  2745  12  mg/kg/h  group  and  two  subjects  in  the  propofol 
group).  
Two subjects were found meeting at least one of the exclusion criteria (i.e., one subject in the RMZ 6 
mg/kg/h group, one subject in the RMZ 12 mg/kg/h group and zero subjects in the propofol group).  
The  specific  exclusion  criterion  violated  was  “Exclusion  criterion  5)”  in  one  subject  and  “Exclusion 
criterion 27)” in the other remaining subject. 
There were no subjects with no efficacy endpoints observations or no data on the primary endpoint. 
A total of 33 subjects had treatment violations (i.e., 12 subjects in the RMZ 6 mg/kg/h group, 16 
subjects in the RMZ 12 mg/kg/h group and five subjects in the propofol group). These 33 subjects 
were excluded from the PPS and included in the FAS and SAF, in accordance with stipulations of the 
protocol.

Outcomes and estimation 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  functional  capability  as  a  general  anaesthetic,  as  assessed  on  the 
basis of a composite of 3 variables: “intraoperative awakening or recall,” “requirement of rescue sedation 
with other sedatives” and “body movement.” The absence of these 3 variables is essential in induction 
and maintenance of general anesthesia. In individual subjects, the investigational product was assessed 
as “Effective” when all 3 variables were absent or “Ineffective” when at least one of these 3 variables

The rate of efficacy in terms of functional capability as a general anesthetic was 100% for all treatment 
groups:  RMZ  6  mg/kg/h,  RMZ  12  mg/kg/h,  and  propofol.  Given  the  100%  rate  of  efficacy  in  all  3 
treatment groups, the RMZ 12 mg/kg/h group and RMZ 6 mg/kg/h group were verified as non-inferior 
to the propofol group in terms of functional capability as a general anesthetic. 
In terms of induction of anesthesia, continuous intravenous infusion of RMZ caused loss of consciousness 
in all subjects, thereby demonstrating the compound’s capability to appropriately induce anesthesia. In 
the  RMZ  6  mg/kg/h  group  (n=150)  and  RMZ  12  mg/kg/h  group  (n=150),  mean  time  to  loss  of 
consciousness  from  the  start  of  investigational  product  administration  was  102.0  and  88.7  seconds, 
respectively,  with  a  statistically  significant  shorter  duration  observed  in  the  RMZ  12  mg/kg/h  group 
compared with the RMZ 6 mg/kg/h group (p<0.0001). In the propofol group (n=75), mean time to loss 
of consciousness was 78.7 seconds, which was a statistically significant shorter duration compared with 
the RMZ 6 mg/kg/h group and ONO- 2745 12 mg/kg/h group (p<0.0001 and p=0.0149, respectively).  
Table 35: Time from initiation of study drug administration to loss of consciousness 
In the RMZ 6 mg/kg/h group (n=150) and RMZ 12 mg/kg/h group (n=150), mean (5 to 95 percentile 
points) dose required for loss of consciousness was 0.17 (0.10 to 0.24) and 0.29 (0.18 to 0.43) mg/kg, 
respectively. 
In terms of maintenance of anesthesia, continuous intravenous infusion with RMZ allowed the adjustment 
of infusion rate based on monitoring of BIS value and general condition of individual subjects. The mean 
(5 to 95 percentile points) optimal infusion rate during maintenance of anesthesia in the RMZ 6 mg/kg/h 
group  and  RMZ  12  mg/kg/h  group  was  0.97  (0.40  to  1.58)  and  0.99  (0.40  to  2.00)  mg/kg/h, 
respectively.  The  BIS  values  (mean)  during  maintenance  of  anesthesia  in  the  RMZ  6  mg/kg/h  group, 
RMZ  12  mg/kg/h  group  and  propofol  group  ranged  between  40.0–82.0,  47.8–84.0  and  39.0–56.3, 
respectively. 
The time (mean) from end of investigational product administration to awakening, extubation, stating 
date of birth, and decision to exit the operating room in the RMZ 6 mg/kg/h group were 14.9, 19.2, 24.8 
and 28.7 minutes, respectively, and were 14.5, 19.2, 24.1 and 27.9 minutes, respectively, in the RMZ 
12 mg/kg/h  group, showing no statistically significant differences between the RMZ 6 mg/kg/h group 
and RMZ 12 mg/kg/h group (p=0.7294, p=0.9743, p=0.7290 and p=0.6730, respectively). Awakening 
was  not  observed  after  30  minutes  from  the  end  of  RMZ  administration  in  14  subjects  in  the  RMZ  6 
mg/kg/h group and 13 subjects in the RMZ 12 mg/kg/h group; among these 10/14 and 7/13 subjects, 
respectively, were given flumazenil. Of these, 1 subject in the RMZ 6 mg/kg/h group was given flumazenil 
twice before awakening; while the other subjects were given flumazenil once. The mean time from initial 
flumazenil dosing to awakening in the RMZ 6 mg/kg/h group and RMZ 12 mg/kg/h group was 1.8 minutes 
and 0.9 minutes, respectively. In the propofol group (n=75), the mean time to awakening, extubation, 
stating date of birth, and decision to exit the operating room were 10.3, 13.1, 15.6 and 19.1 minutes, 
respectively,  which  were  statistically  significant  shorter  durations  compared  with  the  RMZ  6  mg/kg/h

results from study ONO-2745-05.  
Title: A multicenter, randomized, parallel-group study of ono-2745 compared with propofol in surgical 
patients undergoing general anesthesia 
Study identifier 
Protocol Number: ONO-2745-05 
Design 
A randomized, parallel-group, multi-centre, confirmatory non-inferiority study of 
remimazolam compared with propofol in surgical patients, ASA class I or II undergoing GA. 
Patients were allocated to 1 of 3 treatment groups; two remimazolam groups or one 
propofol control group. The remimazolam groups differed in terms of the dose to be 
administered for induction (6 mg/kg/h or 12 mg/kg/h. Subjects were therefore allocated at 
a 2:1 ratio to either remimazolam or propofol. Subjects were blinded (single-blind) to 
treatment allocation and investigators were blinded (double-blind) to the dose of 
remimazolam for induction. A patient registration centre was used to randomise patients 
using dynamic allocation. 
Duration of main phase:   
Use for GA induction / maintenance. The  
maximum trial duration for any patient was up

Endpoints and 
definitions 
Primary 
endpoint 
The functional 
capability of 
remimazolam 
as a general 
anaesthetic 
(GA) 
Assessed on the basis of a composite of 3 variables. In 
individual subjects, the investigational product was 
assessed as “Effective” if all 3 variables were absent or 
“Ineffective” if at least one of these 3 variables was 
present. 
1. Intraoperative awakening or recall 
2. Requirement of rescue sedation with other sedatives 
3. Body movement 
The following two hypotheses were to be tested: 
1. The ONO-2745 12 mg/kg/h group is noninferior to 
the propofol group. 
2. The ONO-2745 6 mg/kg/h group is noninferior to the 
propofol group. 
Non-inferiority was to be concluded if the lower limit of 
the confidence interval for the difference was greater 
than -10%. If the first comparison for “1.” failed to 
demonstrate non-inferiority, then the second 
comparison for “2.” was not to be performed. 
Noninferiority was also to be declared if the efficacy 
rate was 100% for both treatment groups compared 
and thus no confidence interval could be calculated. 
Time to loss of consciousness from the start of 
investigational product administration 
Assessed on Day 1 of investigational product 
administration (at entry to the operating room [prior to 
remifentanil administration], immediately prior to the 
start of investigational product administration, at loss 
of consciousness, 2 minutes after loss of 
consciousness, immediately after endotracheal 
intubation, during maintenance of anaesthesia [every 5 
minutes], immediately prior to the end of 
investigational product administration, from the end of 
investigational product administration to the decision to 
exit the operating room [every 5 minutes], at 
discontinuation of investigational product 
administration) 
Following the end of investigational product 
administration, awakening in response to verbal stimuli 
was verified approximately every 30 seconds. The time 
of awakening was defined as the time when the subject 
first opened his/her eyes in response to verbal stimuli. 
Following the end of IMP administration, the 
appropriateness of extubation was determined 
according to the following criteria 
a. Awakening in response to verbal stimuli 
b. Adequate recovery of respiration 
c. Stable blood pressure and heart rate 
d. Recovery of muscle strength (e.g., head lift for 5 
seconds, strong hand grip) 
Subjects had to fulfill all of the criteria prior to 
extubation 
Following extubation, the subject was asked to state 
his/her date of birth approximately every 30 seconds. 
The time when the subject was first able to accurately 
state his/her date of birth was recorded.

2.6.5.3  Clinical studies in special populations 
Four studies have been conducted in special populations. These are outlined in the Table 38. 
Table 38: Clinical studies in special populations  
Study ONO-2745-IVU007 included 11 patients with either moderate or severe chronic hepatic 
impairment, eight patients with moderate hepatic impairment and three patients with severe hepatic 
impairment. 
Study CNS7056-012 included 11 patients with end stage renal disease not requiring dialysis, six 
patients with eGFR15-30 mL/min/1.73m2 and five patients with eGFR<15 mL/min/1.73m2. 
In addition to these patients, group C of the integrated analysis included 47 patients who suffered from 
severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2). 
Study CNS7056-014 was an abuse liability study conducted in healthy adults who were non-
dependent, non-treatment–seeking, recreational CNS depressant users. Commonly used recreational 
drugs were cannabis, benzodiazepines and opioids.  
Within CNS7056-020, 11 healthy female volunteers were exposed to various concentrations of 
ethanol prior to oral administration of remimazolam. 
Insufficient data 
The Table 39 highlights all those subpopulations, in addition to pregnant women, where there is 
insufficient data across the general anaesthesia development program. 
Table 39: Populations with insufficient data in group C 
Even though only three patients of African American or black origin were included in the development 
program, no ethnic differences in remimazolam PK or PD have been identified.  
The  characterisation  of  moderate  and  severe  liver  dysfunction  was  based  on  bilirubin,  and  not  Child-
Pugh  criteria,  as  in  in  study  ONO-2745-IVU007.  The  lack  of  patients  observed  with  severe  liver 
dysfunction is likely consistent with the assumption of lack of patients with severe hepatic impairment 
Assessment report  
EMA/79576/2023  
Page 76/129 
 
 
 
 
 
 
according  to  the  Child-Pugh  score.  Hepatic  impairment  is  mentioned  accordingly  under  “Special 
populations”  in section 4.2. of the SmPC. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild 
(Child-Pugh scores 5 and 6) or moderate (Child-Pugh scores 7 to 9) hepatic impairment. In patients with 
severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh scores 10 to 15; data from only 3 subjects in clinical trials), the 
clinical effects may be more pronounced and last longer than in healthy subjects. No dose adjustments 
are required but careful attention should be paid to the timing of titration doses and remimazolam should 
be carefully titrated to effect in these patients (see also SmPC section 4.4). 
For the majority of studies patients were excluded if they lacked capacity to be able to provide informed 
consent. This explains the lack of patients with a history of dementia or cognitive disorders. 
Many indications of neurosurgery under general anaesthesia include patients with an underlying organic 
brain defect. These patients were excluded from the non-cardiac pivotal studies to ensure that did not 
confound the measurement of the Bispectral Index (BIS) value. Therefore, the following text is included 
in SmPC section 4.2: 
Other populations 
The  safety  and  efficacy  of  remimazolam  in  patients  undergoing  intracranial  surgery  and  patients  with 
pre-existing cognitive disorders have not yet been established. No data are available. 
2.6.5.4  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The  analysis  of  efficacy  across  trials  focused  on  the  pivotal  and  all  controlled  trials  versus  propofol 
(groups A and B). Group C (all GA trials) was used mostly for the purpose of sensitivity analysis of the 
results obtained in groups A and B. For the majority of the analyses the per protocol (PP) set is shown 
while  the  analyses  using  the  intent  to  treat  (ITT)  population  set  is  provided  in  the  set  of  tables.  All 
remimazolam patients receiving an induction dose of either 6 mg/kg/h or 6 mg/min were pooled into the 
low remimazolam dose group while the ones receiving 12 mg/kg/h were assigned to the remimazolam 
high dose group. These two groups were considered for induction endpoints only in order to characterize 
efficacy  of  both  doses  for  induction  of  GA.  However,  for  analyses  of  other  endpoints  only  the  total 
remimazolam  group  was  considered  (i.e.  low  and  high  dose  patients  pooled)  since  the  difference  in 
dosing was only during the first few minutes of a treatment that lasted many hours.  
Since the primary efficacy endpoint was different between trials and could not be pooled, an integrated 
efficacy endpoint was designed. This endpoint was defined as:  
1) successful conduct of the surgical intervention  
2) no need for rescue sedative medication (see GA-IA SAP).  
Both parameters needed to be met for the patient to reach the endpoint. Success rates were compared 
between total remimazolam and total propofol groups with a non-inferiority approach. 
Secondary  endpoints  that  were  available  across  the  majority  of  trials  were  analysed  additionally,  for 
potential differences between remimazolam and propofol as well as between subgroups (e.g. age). 
Results of Primary Endpoint 
Non-inferiority of remimazolam when compared to propofol was demonstrated in the two pivotal Phase 
III  trials  (ONO-2745-05  and  CNS7056-022)  and  in  the  Phase  II  trial  CNS7056-010  using  primary 
endpoints as defined in each trial. The remaining propofol controlled trial (CNS7056-011) was initially 
designed as a pivotal Phase III study, but prematurely terminated due to lack of recruitment. For this 
trial non-inferiority was not assessed. All individual trials confirmed non-inferiority of remimazolam to 
propofol, as outlined in the Table 43.

CNS7056-010 
This was a Phase II safety, efficacy and PK study in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, including follow-
up sedation, in the post anaesthesia care unit. 
In terms of trial design, CNS7056-010 was a randomized, single-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group 
Phase II study to investigate the efficacy and safety of remimazolam (compared to sevoflurane/propofol) 
as  an  anaesthetic/sedative  drug  used  in  general  anaesthesia  in  patients  undergoing  major  elective 
cardiac  surgery  (i.e.  surgery  assumed  to  require  more  than  two  hours  of  maintenance  of  general 
anaesthesia and the use of extracorporeal circulation). 
The study included 62 patients receiving remimazolam and 28 patients receiving propofol/sevoflurane in 
the pooled ITT set. 
Patients  were  randomized  at  a  rate  of  1:1:1  to  receive  sevoflurane/propofol  or  1  of  2  doses  of 
remimazolam, 6 mg/kg/h or 12 mg/kg/h for the purposes of induction (see Table 41). Randomization 
was stratified by planned post-anaesthesia care (stratum 1: patients planned for the post-anaesthesia 
care unit [PACU], stratum 2: patients planned for the intensive care unit [ICU]).

Sedation with remimazolam for ICU mechanical ventilation was limited to 24 hours after the end of the 
surgery. 
The primary objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of remimazolam as general anaesthetic 
when given in combination with fentanyl/remifentanil to patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. 
Efficacy was measured as the proportion of patients with successful anaesthesia, i.e. patients with no 
use  of  rescue  sedative  medication  between  start  of  the  study  medication  and  end  of  the  surgical 
procedure (completion of last skin suture). 
With regards to efficacy results, anaesthesia was successful, i.e. no rescue sedative medication was 
used between the start of the study medication and the end of the surgical procedure (completion of last 
skin suture), in all patients except one in the remimazolam 12 mg/kg/h-induction group and one in the 
propofol/sevoflurane group (see Table 42). 
Table 42: Number of patients that met the primary objective in CNS7056-010 
Three  patients  (8.8%)  in  the  remimazolam  6  mg/kg/h  group  showed  signs  of  awakening  during  the 
maintenance phase. The signs were specified as “breathing against the ventilator” and “fluctuation of 
blood pressure” in one patient each. In the third patient signs of awakening were not specified. In the 
remimazolam 12 mg/kg/h and propofol/sevoflurane groups no patient showed signs of intra-operative 
awakening. 
The mean percentage of time with NCI ≤60 during maintenance of anaesthesia was almost 100% and 
comparable  between  the  3  treatment  groups:  remimazolam  6  mg/kg/h  95.8%,  remimazolam  12 
mg/kg/kg  93.3%,  and  propofol/sevoflurane  96.9%,  indicating  the  efficacy  of  remimazolam  for 
maintenance of general anaesthesia as compared to propofol. 
Results of time-to-events are summarized in theTable 43. In general, all time to events were slightly 
shorter in the propofol/sevoflurane group than in the two remimazolam groups and the onset times were 
longer  for  remimazolam  6  mg/kg/kg  than  for  remimazolam  12  mg/kg/h.  LoC  was  achieved  quickly 
(approximately 1 minute) in all three treatment groups. Time to LoC was slightly shorter for propofol 
than  for  remimazolam  6  mg/kg/h  and  remimazolam  12  mg/kg/kg.  Intubation  was  completed  within

approximately five minutes after start of study drug administration. Within approximately 5-6 hours after 
the end of the surgery, patients were ready to be discharged from PACU/ICU. 
Table 43: Time to event assessments in CNS CNS7056-010 
During  the  course  of  this  trial,  there  was  a  learning  effect  in  the  use  of  remimazolam  for  general 
anaesthesia.  At  later  stages  of  the  trial,  the  dose  of  remimazolam  was  tapered  down  to  0.1  mg/kg/h 
prior to arriving at PACU/ICU in 14 patients. In these patients, the time to extubation (median 109.0 
minutes, 95% CI: 87.0, 148.0) was shorter than that in all remimazolam patients in total (median 145.5 
minutes,  95%  CI:  111.0,  170.0)  and  similar  to  that  in  the  propofol/sevoflurane  group  (median  97.0 
minutes, 95% CI: 83.0, 140.0). These results suggested that tapering by reducing the infusion rate of 
remimazolam towards to end of surgery can shorten recovery time to a level similar to propofol.

With  regards  to  hemodynamic  stability,  all  patients  in  this  study  were  administered  vasopressors. 
Norepinephrine was used by all patients, except for one in the remimazolam 6 mg/kg/h group, whereas 
epinephrine and dobutamine were used much less frequently considered. Vasopressor use is presented 
in the Table 44. 
The  median  dose  of  norepinephrine  and  the  median  time  on  norepinephrine  were  larger  in  the 
propofol/sevoflurane group than in the remimazolam pooled group. Patients on remimazolam 6 mg/kg/h 
required less norepinephrine than did those on remimazolam 12 mg/kg/h. 
The data on dose and duration of epinephrine and dobutamine were extremely skewed and based on a 
small  number  of  subjects.  Patients  in  the  remimazolam  pooled  group  used  slightly  more  epinephrine 
than those on propofol/sevoflurane, but median duration of use was the same in both groups. The median 
dose of dobutamine was larger in the remimazolam pooled group than in the propofol/sevoflurane group, 
but the duration of use was otherwise. 
Table 44: Vasopressor use (CNS7056-010) 
In  this  trial  cardio-depressive  effects  were  assessed  using  two  specific  safety  endpoints:  cardiac 
instability and low cardiac output syndrome. 
Assessment report  
EMA/79576/2023  
Page 81/129 
 
 
 
 
Cardiac instability was defined as all of the following: 
• 
Fall  in  mean  arterial  blood  pressure  of  more  than  30%  from  baseline  at  induction  of  general 
anaesthesia; 
•  Heart rate at induction below 50 bpm over at least one minute; 
•  Need for vasopressive treatment, defined as >0.1 μg/kg/min noradrenalin for >3 hours in the face 
of normovolemia. For epinephrine and norepinephrine, the corresponding dose is >0.05 μg/kg/min. 
The  incidence  of  cardiostability  (not  fulfilling  any  of  the  criteria  above)  was  higher  in  the  pooled 
remimazolam group (27.4%) than in the propofol/sevoflurane group (14.3%). 
Between the two remimazolam doses, the 6 mg/kg/h showed higher incidence of cardiostability (35.3%) 
than the 12 mg/kg/h (17.9%). 
Low cardiac output syndrome was defined as at least two of the following four criteria being met during 
the general anaesthesia or during recovery until extubation: 
•  ScvO2 <60% with SAO2 98% 
•  Mean arterial pressure <60 mmHg 
•  Urine output <0.5 mL/kg/h 
• 
Lactate >2.0 mmol/L 
Remimazolam appeared to have less cardio-depressive effect than propofol/sevoflurane, despite a lower 
dose  of  norepinephrine  (see  Table  45).  During  general  anaesthesia  (including  recovery  period  until 
extubation),  proportions  of  patients  with  a  low  cardiac  output  syndrome  were  larger  in  the 
propofol/sevoflurane group (25%) than in the pooled remimazolam group (14.5%) as well as 6 mg/kg/h 
and 12 mg/kg/h induction dose groups (14.7% and 14.3% respectively). The same trend was observed 
when the entire observation period was split into GA only period and recovery period for both of them.

CNS7056-011 
This was a randomized, single-blind propofol-controlled phase III study evaluating efficacy and safety of 
remimazolam  in  GA  adult  patients  undergoing  major  non-emergency  cardiac  surgery  utilizing 
extracorporeal circulation, including follow-up sedation, in the post-anaesthesia care unit/intensive care 
unit. 
A total of 530 patients were planned to participate in this study. Patients were randomized at a ratio of 
4:1 to receive sedation during cardiac surgery, with remimazolam or propofol, according to the schedule 
outlined in the Table 46. 
Table 46 
Due to low acceptance of propofol only as comparator, and the complex regulatory and technical set-up 
of all involved study centres, the study was stopped prematurely. Patient recruitment was stopped when 
less than 10% of the planned sample size (n enrolled = 23, n planned = 530) was enrolled. A total of 18 
patients were randomised to remimazolam and five to receive propofol. 
Of the 18 patients randomised to receive remimazolam, four did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint, 
two failed to achieve NCI ≤60 during at least 85% of maintenance time, one required rescue sedative 
medication and one required both rescue sedative medication and failed to achieve NCI ≤60 during >85% 
of maintenance time. Among the patients who received propofol, there was one who did not meet the 
primary efficacy endpoint, because the NCI did not remain ≤60 during at least 85% of maintenance time, 
as detailed in the Table 47. 
Table 47: Proportion of patients with successful sedation (miTT) in CNS7056-11 
Ultimately, as study CNS7056-011 was stopped prematurely due to poor enrolment (after randomising 
less than 10% of the planned sample size of 23 participants), drawing conclusions from this study would 
be inappropriate; it is only presented here for completeness.

ONO-2745-06* 
* The trial is briefly presented here since the value (for this particular application) of an uncontrolled small Japanese 
study,  in  light  of  the  existence  of  a  large  phase  3  controlled  confirmatory  study  undertaken  in  Europe  (CNS7056-
022), is limited.  
ONO-2745-06  was  a  small,  muticenter,  uncontrolled,  randomized,  double-blind,  parallel-group, 
comparative, Phase 3 study conducted in Japan evaluating two doses of remimazolam (6 or 12 mg/kg/h; 
followed by maintenance dose of 1-2 mg/kg/h) in induction and maintenance of GA in surgical patients 
(ASA class III or higher) undergoing GA. 
IV administration of remimazolam was continued at a dose of 6 or 12 mg/kg/h until loss of consciousness 
was  observed.  After  loss  of  consciousness,  intravenous  administration  was  started  at  a  dose  of  1 
mg/kg/h, and infusion rate adjusted as appropriate (upper limit: 2 mg/kg/h), based on monitoring of 
the systemic condition of the subject until the end of the surgery. 
The planned number of subject was 50 (25 in each group). A total of 67 subjects were registered (33 in 
the 6 mg/kg/h group and 34 in the 12 mg/kg/h group); 62 subjects were included in the FAS (31 in the 
6 mg/kg/h group and 31 in the 12 mg/kg/h group) and 55 in the PPS (27 in the 6 mg/kg/h group and 
28 in the 12 mg/kg/h group). 
The primary  efficacy endpoint was remimazolam functional capability as general anesthetic (assessed 
on  the  basis  of  a  composite  of  the  three  variables  described  below).  The  investigational  product  was 
assessed as “Effective” if all three variables were absent or “Ineffective” if at least one of these three 
variables was present: 
• 
Intraoperative awakening/recall 
•  Requirement of rescue sedation with other sedatives 
•  Body movement 
The secondary endpoints are listed below: 
• 
• 
Time from start of administration of investigational product to loss of consciousness 
Intraoperative awakening/recall 
•  Requirement of rescue sedation with other sedatives 
•  Body movement 
•  BIS value at each time point of evaluation 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Time from end of administration of investigational product to awakening 
Time from end of administration of investigational product to extubation 
Time from end of administration of investigational product to patient stating his/her date of 
birth 
Time between end of administration of investigational product and determination of ability to 
discharge the patient from the operating room 
•  Controllability of anesthesia depth 
Looking at the efficacy results, 62 subjects (31 in the ONO-2745 6 mg/kg/h group and 31 in the ONO-
2745  12  mg/kg/h  group)  were  included  in  the  FAS,  which  was  used  as  the  primary  analysis  set  for 
efficacy.

The functional capability of remimazolam as general anesthetic was evaluated as the primary endpoint 
for efficacy. The rate of efficacy for the functional capability of remimazolam as general anesthetic was 
100% in both the 6 and 12 mg/kg/h groups. 
For induction of anesthesia, LoC by continuous intravenous administration of remimazolam was observed 
in all subjects, showing that remimazolam could induce anesthesia appropriately. The mean time from 
start of IMP administration to loss of consciousness was 97.2 and 81.7 seconds in 31 subjects in the 6 
mg/kg/h group and 31 subjects in the 12 mg/kg/h group, respectively, showing there was a significant 
shorter mean time from start of remimazolam administration to loss of consciousness in the 12 mg/kg/h 
group compared with the 6 mg/kg/h group. The mean dose (5% to 95% point) of remimazolam until 
loss of consciousness was 0.16 (0.11 to 0.24) and 0.27 (0.17 to 0.42) mg/kg in 31 subjects in the 6 
mg/kg/h group, and 31 subjects in the 12 mg/kg/h group, respectively. 
For  maintenance  of  anesthesia,  continuous  administration  of  remimazolam,  with  proper  dose 
adjustments while monitoring BIS value and systemic condition, was possible. The mean optimal infusion 
rate (5% to 95% point) during maintenance of anesthesia with remimazolam was 0.56 (0.13 to 1.00) 
and 0.57 (0.10 to 1.00) mg/kg/h in the 6 mg/kg/h and 12 mg/kg/h groups, respectively.  
The mean BIS value during maintenance of anesthesia was in ranges from 46.0 to 68.0 and 44.7 to 67.5 
in the 6 mg/kg/h and 12 mg/kg/h groups, respectively. 
The  mean  time  from  end  of  remimazolam  administration  to  awakening,  extubation,  patient  stating 
his/her date of birth, and determination of ability to discharge the patient from the operating room was 
9.6, 12.8, 15.2, and 18.0 minutes, respectively, in the 6 mg/kg/h group and 8.6, 11.6, 17.7, and 21.6 
minutes, respectively, in the mg/kg/h group, showing there were no statistically significant differences 
between  the  6  mg/kg/h  and  12  mg/kg/h  groups  (p=0.6307,  p=0.5975,  p=0.3617,  and  p=0.1808, 
respectively).  
Flumazenil was administered to two subjects in the 6 mg/kg/h group who did not awaken 30 minutes 
after  the  end  of  remimazolam  administration.  The  mean  time  from  flumazenil  administration  to 
awakening  was  1.0  minute,  the  mean  time  to  extubation  was  2.0  minutes,  the  mean  time  until  the 
patient could state his/her date of birth was 3.0 minutes, and the mean time until determination of ability 
to discharge the patient from the operating room was 3.5 minutes, and no re-sedation was reported in 
these two subjects in the 6 mg/kg/h group.  
Controllability of anesthesia depth was “very good” or “good” in all subjects. 
2.6.6  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of remimazolam for induction and maintenance of GA was evaluated in six clinical trials.  
Studies  CNS7056-022  and  ONO-2745-05  were  the  two  pivotal  studies,  the  former  conducted  in 
Europe, the latter in Japan. Both were randomised, open-label, non-inferiority studies using propofol as 
comparator. 
The non-inferiority margin for study CNS7056-022 was discussed during a scientific advice procedure 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/14117/2018) and the NIM of 10% was found to be acceptable. 
This trial planned to randomly enrol 542 patients. However, due to the pandemic, the trial was terminated 
before the sample size could be reached. At the time of termination, 365 patients had been randomised 
(about 67% of planned sample size). 
One  protocol  amendment  for  Germany  only,  and  three  global  protocol  amendments  occurred.  The 
protocol amendment for Germany only and the first global protocol amendment occurred before FPFV, 
thus they did not impact the study results. The second and third global protocol amendments included 
Assessment report  
EMA/79576/2023  
Page 85/129 
 
 
 
many minor changes. However, two important exceptions were noted and required further clarification 
from  the  MAH.  In  the  second  global  protocol  amendment,  the  dosing  regimen  for  remifentanil  was 
changed, from remifentanil in the range of 0.2 to 0.5 μg/kg/min, for the first 15 minutes after the first 
skin incision, to from intubation until 15 minutes after first skin incision, remifentanil was to be dosed 
between ≥0.1 to ≤0.2 μg/kg/min, depending on the individual needs of the patient. In other words, the 
dosing was significantly reduced, and the reduction concerned the critical period (15 minutes after the 
first skin incision), when haemodynamic superiority to propofol was tested. One of the most common 
adverse  reactions  of  remifentanil  is  hypotension;  therefore,  this  protocol  amendment  could  have 
influenced study results. This concern was addressed accordingly. The reduction of the remifentanil dose 
during the first 15 minutes after the first skin incision was done at the request of several investigators. 
The  reduction  was  done  via  the  Global  Protocol  Amendment  (GPA)  2,  when  only  50  of  the  total 
participants (13.7%) had been already included. The MAH provided additional analyses, as requested, 
showing results for patients randomised before and after GPA 2, per treatment arm. It was reassuring 
to see that the results before and after GPA 2 did not differ to a clinically important extent. The MAH 
further  explained  that,  although  in  GPA  3  changes  to  Section  'Analysis  Populations'  occured,  these 
changes  were  only  wording  clarifications.  The  definitions  of  populations  did  not  change  and  therefore 
there was no change in the assignment of any individual patient to the analysis populations. Regarding 
the protocol deviations leading to exclusions from the PP1 and PP2 sets, no particular concerns arose 
from these exclusions. 
The primary efficacy endpoint (PEP) was the anaesthetic effect of remimazolam and propofol assessed 
as percent (%) of time of NCI ≤60 during the maintenance phase of the GA, defined as the time between 
the first skin incision and the completion of the last skin suture. The confirmatory statistical analysis of 
the primary endpoint was conducted on the PP1. 
Secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  designed  to  evaluate  time  to  onset  of  action  of  both  IMPs. 
Haemodynamic  instability  was  defined  as  the  key  secondary  endpoint  (KSE).  Superiority  of 
remimazolam over propofol in terms of the KSE was defined as critical decrease(s) in mean arterial blood 
pressure  (MAP)  between  start  of  investigational  medical  product  and  15  minutes  after  the  first  skin 
incision. 
One interim analysis (IA) and one final analysis (FA) were planned for study CNS7056-022. The primary 
efficacy  endpoint  (PEP)  was  to  be  analysed  at  IA,  while  the  key  secondary  endpoint  (KSE)  was  to  be 
analysed at both IA and FA.  
The SAP was updated several times (SAP V 2.0 was in place at the time of trial starting, but the Wilcoxon 
test was only present in V 7.0 KSE confirmatory analyses, and these were not pre-planned). It became 
apparent that relevant (superiority) analyses were implemented a posteriori, which might jeopardize the 
real effect of the product. In spite of the lack of anticipation of the sample type of patients, the MAH 
justified the adaptation of the SAP to allow a minimally adequate primary analysis assessment.  
Primary endpoint 
The  mean  difference  between  remimazolam  and  propofol  in  percentage  of  time  spent  with  NCI  ≤60 
during the maintenance phase of the GA was -4.24, with a lower boundary of the 97.5% CI of -7.48, 
which is above the pre-defined threshold of 10. Therefore, non-inferiority of remimazolam to propofol 
was confirmed. As pointed out during scientific advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/14117/2018), since the dosing 
is adaptive and based on the target NTC score, this endpoint, by definition, will almost always be reached. 
Although  the  MAH  considered  there  was  no  significant  difference  from  propofol  in  the  ToI  of  PEP,  a 
clinically significant difference in the variance was noted by the CHMP, with patients in the remimazolam 
arm requiring up to 528 minutes and propofol patients up to 361 minutes. The standard deviation was 
90.6 minutes in remimazolam and 74.5 minutes in propofol. A discussion on this matter was therefore 
Assessment report  
EMA/79576/2023  
Page 86/129 
 
 
 
deemed  necessary  to  ascertain  whether  propofol  seemed  more  reliable  or  not  in  induction  of  GA. 
Ultimately, it was concluded that, in spite of the increase in the meantime of interest of 12 minutes for 
remimazolam  as  compared  to  propofol,  the  median  only  differs  in  four  minutes.  Even  in  prolonged 
surgeries, the difference is considered as not clinically relevant. On the other hand, the induction of GA 
is  numerically  quicker  with  remimazolam.  All  aspects  considered,  it  was  agreed  that  the  numerical 
difference is non-clinically significant. 
“Key” secondary endpoint 
Several secondary efficacy endpoints pointed towards a different direction from the primary endpoint, 
such as time to orientation in study CNS 7056-022, where propofol performed significantly better than 
remimazolam. 
Onset  of  effect  -  the  time  to  event  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  indicated  a  slightly  quicker  onset  of 
action  in  remimazolam  compared  to  propofol,  although  these  results  were  difficult  to  interpret  in  the 
light of a higher percentage of patients with too deep anaesthesia in remimazolam arm.  
Offset of effect - the secondary efficacy outcomes of time from the stop of the IMP to extubation were 
similar in both treatment arms. However, a difference was observed in time from stop of IMP to response 
to verbal command (15 min in remimazolam compared to 12 min in propofol). An even larger difference 
disfavouring  remimazolam  is  observed  in  time  from  stop  of  IMP  to  orientation  (54  minutes  in 
remimazolam compared to 30 minutes in propofol). The almost doubling of time to orientation in time, 
place, person and situation observed with remimazolam was noted as clinically relevant and unlikely to 
be solely the consequence of lack of experience with the product. The prolonged disorientation is outlined 
in the SmPC (section 4.4, 4.8). 
Similarly, time to modified Aldrete Score ≥9 was 53 minutes in remimazolam compared to 37 minutes in 
propofol groups with almost no overlapping in CIs (95% CI 44-58 mins for remimazolam and 28-45 mins 
for propofol). Since the modified Aldrete score is used to evaluate patients in post anaesthesia care, with 
the  purpose  to  check  whether  they  can  be  safely  discharged,  this  information  is  considered  to  be  of 
importance  for  healthcare  practitioners,  thus  outlined  in  the  SmPC  (section  4.4,  5.1).  These 
characteristics demand more time from the anaesthesiologist team to attend the patient after surgery. 
Explicit awareness (incidence of the occurrence of intra-operative awakening) was not evident in either 
treatment  groups  during  the  procedures.  However,  unspecific,  potential  signs  of  intraoperative 
awakening were reported with a notably higher occurrence in remimazolam arm compared to propofol 
(18.5%  vs  7.4%).  This  could  partially  be  explained  by  the  unfamiliarity  of  investigators  with 
remimazolam resulting in closer observation of patients.  
The  percentage  of  time  with  NCI  ≤60  and  ≥27  during  the  maintenance  (first  skin  incision  to  last  skin 
suture) was higher in the PPF arm than in the RMZ (78% vs 68%) arm based on the FAS. This was due 
to  a  higher  proportion  of  patients  with  both  NCI<  27  and  NCI>60,  which  may  be  related  to  a  higher 
difficulty in adequately refine the level of anaesthesia. 
Secondary  efficacy  endpoints  related  to  NCI  and  rescue/other  sedatives  generally  showed  a  higher 
percentage of time within the target NCI in propofol, as well as a higher percentage of time below target 
NCI in remimazolam arm. The percentage of patients in target NCI range during ≥90% of maintenance 
was higher in propofol compared to remimazolam arms (56.8% vs 34.8%, respectively). Consistent with 
these  results,  the  use  of  rescue  sedatives  and  other  sedatives  was  higher  among  patients  receiving 
remimazolam  compared  to  patients  receiving  propofol.  To  summarise,  these  results  indicated  better 
secondary efficacy results with propofol. However, the familiarity of investigators with propofol compared 
to no prior experience with remimazolam might play an important role in these results. 
Assessment report  
EMA/79576/2023

Hemodynamic  stability  was  analysed  separately,  as  a  key  secondary  outcome.  Superiority  of 
remimazolam over propofol was formally evaluated only in the European pivotal study. The CHMP noted 
that the conclusions of this analysis are hampered by post-hoc modifications of the statistical analysis 
plan. Therefore, no superiority of remimazolam over propofol on the account of haemodynamic stability 
can be claimed. 
The MAH argued that based on historical data from previous remimazolam trials, a normal distribution 
was  assumed  for  this  endpoint  and  a  2-sided  z-test  comparing  the  mean  number  of  events  of 
haemodynamic  instability  per  patient  between  the  two  treatment  groups  was  chosen  to  demonstrate 
this.  Study  power  and  sample  size  was  calculated  using  assumption  of  normal  distribution  for  KSE. 
However,  historical  data  were  not  graphically  displayed,  and  normality  tests  were  not  presented,  so 
appropriateness  of  the  assumption  of  normal  distribution  does  not  appear  to  be  adequately  justified. 
Moreover, considering the definition of this endpoint, and the fact that the observation is count data, the 
assumption  of  normal  distribution  instead  of  Poisson  or  negative  binomial  distribution  does  not  seem 
appropriate. 
When the data were unblinded for the interim analysis, a non-normal asymmetric distribution was seen. 
Using the Pearson Chi-Square test by Maximum Likelihood Estimations, the KSE event data was found 
to  have  negative  binomial  distribution  (NBD)  for  the  FAS  population,  which,  in  line  with  the  above 
comments, could have been expected from the start. It is agreed that, in case of non-normally distributed 
data, the use of z-test is not appropriate.  
The MAH further argued that during IA a high correlation between the sub-events of the composite KSE 
endpoint was found. This should also have been expected in the planning stage considering the definition 
of this endpoint (e.g. it is clear that all patients who have MAP decrease of > 30% also have MAP decrease 
of > 20%).  The MAH claimed that “As recommended by the ICH E9, in case of a composite endpoint the 
high  inter-component  correlation  of  the  sub-events  must  be  taken  into  account”  and  “Moreover,  sub-
events  with  high  correlation  to  each  other  (20%  and  30%  decrease)  were  discouraged  by  general 
guidelines”. However, such recommendation could not be found neither in ICH E9 nor in ICH E9(R1).  
In addition, the composite endpoint did not seem to be validated. 
Taking into account all of the above, it seemed that, in the planning stage, the MAH did not thoroughly 
think through all relevant aspects of this endpoint.  
Thus, the MAH proposed a new method to analyse KSE: the Common Factor Analysis (CFA). The CFA is 
a  statistical  method  used  to  describe  variability  among  observed,  correlated  variables  in  terms  of  a 
potentially  lower  number  of  unobserved  variables  called  factors.  However,  the  argumentation  for  the 
choice of factors to be included in the analysis was unclear, and it was difficult to conclude how well the 
selected factor represents the original data.  
Although it can be agreed with the MAH that an endpoint without highly correlated components would 
be more relevant than the initially planned one, clinical relevance of the observed difference is ultimately 
difficult to interpret.

with

during

advice 
procedure 
EMEA/H/SA/2825/1/FU/2/2017/SME/II,  the  MAH was  asked  to  present  results  of  the  KSE  that  counts 
only events of “Incidence of MAP dropping below 65 mmHg for at least 1 min duration” and “Number of 
norepinephrine boluses (0.01 mg) required or, if an infusion is used to maintain MAP equal to or above 
65 mmHg, then each time interval of 2 min duration of continuous norepinephrine infusion will be counted 
as  one  event.”  (i.e.  sub-components  1  and  4  of  the  initially  proposed  KSE).  The  MAH  provided  the 
requested analyses and it was reassuring to see that, according to the subcomponents which are clinically 
most meaningful, remimazolam was associated with less events of MAP drops below 65mmHg and with 
less events of norepinephrine administrations compared to propofol.

Regarding  investigator’s  overall  satisfaction  with  IMP,  it  is  acknowledged  that  that  the  majority  of 
investigators found both treatments satisfactory, i.e. on the scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being the lowest and 
10 the highest level of satisfaction, a score above 8 was registered for 55.2% patients in remimazolam 
and for 54.7% patients in propofol group. However, the lowest level of satisfaction (category 1-3) was 
recorded for 7.4% patients in remimazolam and 3.2% in propofol groups. 
Discussion of ancillary analysis for study CNS 0756-022 
Preventing  organ  injury  is  the  overarching  concept  behind  anaesthetic  management  during  surgical 
interventions. While oxygen consumption is usually downregulated during phases of anaesthesia due to 
a downregulation of the sympathetic nerve tone, the oxygen delivery to the tissues is still dependent on 
the oxygen uptake through the lungs and the transport of oxygen through the vascular system. 
The  setting  of  controlled  ventilation,  which  is  most  frequently  applied  in  the  context  of  general 
anaesthesia,  results in limited ventilatory compensation in regards to oxygen delivery and makes the 
haemodynamic  situation  so  important.  The  human  body  controls  the  haemodynamic  situation  by  two 
main  parameters  –  cardiac  output  and  vessel  resistance.  Both  parameters  then  determine  the  mean 
arterial pressure (see Section 2.1.1). 
Scientific literature focuses on thresholds for MAP with regards to haemodynamic monitoring, simply due 
to the fact that non-invasive measurements of blood pressure are easily and reliably possible, whereas 
non-invasive measurements of more complex parameters, such as cardiac output and vessel resistance 
are not easily implementable, and sometimes do not exist yet.  
Mean arterial pressure alone may not always be the correct guide to recognize low oxygen delivery. For 
example,  a  low  cardiac  output  combined  with  a  high  systemic  vessel  resistance  may  produce  a 
reasonably high mean arterial pressure although the end organs still suffer due to too little blood delivery. 
Hence, it is recommended to widen the view when describing the haemodynamic situations of patients 
in general and for the purpose of the evaluation of the effects of propofol and remimazolam in particular. 
Results were therefore evaluated and presented for the above-mentioned main parameters – CO, SVR 
and  MAP.  In  addition,  evaluations  were  presented  for  the  reversed  adjusted  area  under  the  curve 
(RAAUC) and for the use of vasopressors.  
Besides very few exceptions, all parameters in all patient populations and for all time periods of interest 
clearly demonstrated significant differences in favor of remimazolam. Exploring these differences along 
their physiological dependencies of the underlying parameters leads to substantial and clinically relevant 
advantages  for  remimazolam  in  both,  cardiac  output  and  MAP,  which  are  -statistically  evident-  more 
compromised  under  propofol  than  under  remimazolam  and  indicate  that  the  MAP  as  well  as  the  CO 
consistently remained above those thresholds which are associated with organ injury. 
The above presented analyses are considered a robust body of evidence for a statistically significant and 
clinically  relevant  advantage  of  remimazolam  over  propofol.  This  advantage  should  be  seen  in  the 
superior preservation of the haemodynamic status rather than in an “improvement” of haemodynamic 
stability. 
It  is  of  particular  importance  that  these  advantages  were  demonstrated  for  remimazolam  despite the 
fact that significantly more vasopressors were used in the propofol group. It seems to be common sense 
that the significantly higher need to administer a vasopressor to preserve haemodynamic stability is a 
disadvantage in itself. 
Clinical relevance can best be demonstrated in the evaluation of the RAAUC, namely the integration of 
the  time  periods  in  which  patients  were  under  the  threshold  of  65 mmHg.  Salmasi  et  al  have  clearly 
demonstrated the dependency of organ injury on both dimensions, the extent of MAP decrease (in mmHg 
Assessment report

Page 89/129 
 
 
 
below  65 mmHg)  as  well  as  the  duration  of  this  decrease.  It  is  therefore  a  relevant  difference  if  MAP 
drops further below 65 mmHg and remains for a longer time below that threshold. 
Discussion 
The  choice  of  the  studies  mostly  on  cardiac  surgery  was  chosen  due  to  the  availability  of  invasive 
haemodynamic data. However, this significantly decrease the external validity and extrapolation exercise 
to  the  other  types  of  surgical  procedures:  first,  on  these  pts  a  tight  control  of  the  haemodynamic 
parameters is performed (the justification for invasive continuous monitoring); second, there are other 
variables which, if not balanced among the different study arms, may influence the results. The Applicant 
has studied one of these very important variables – the use of vasopressors – but not the blood loss / 
use of erythrocyte transfusions. Also, along the discussion, the Applicant highlights the high variance of 
remimazolam or propofol for to extol the haemodynamic advantage of remimazolam, but the rationale 
should be identical. One cannot mention or deemphasise variance in remimazolam results of MAP, and 
emphasise variance in propofol data of SVR, especially when vasopressors are concomitantly used. 
All things considered and weighing the fact that most of these procedures were cardiac surgeries, there 
is only one aspect which is considered clinically relevant and likely devoid of other confounders, which is 
the use of concomitant vasopressors. While the doses were similar between remimazolam and propofol 
– as would be expected, the percentage of time under vasopressors is 23% witn remimazolam and 42% 
with  propofol.  This  is  considered  an  indirect  measure  of  haemodynamic  stability.  Very  experienced 
anaesthesiologists  like  those  who  assist  cardiac  surgery  are  capable  of  continuously  control 
haemodynamic status of the patient, at the cost of a higher use of vasopressor agents. 
Study ONO-2745-05 
The primary efficacy endpoint was functional capability as a general anaesthetic and was achieved by all 
participants (100%) in each of the treatment arms. 
Regarding  the  mean  time  from  initiation  of  study  drug  to  loss  of  consciousness,  propofol  showed 
statistically significant shorter time compared to both doses of remimazolam (78.7 seconds in propofol 
compared to 102.0 seconds in remimazolam 6 mg/kg/h and 88.7 seconds in remimazolam 12 mg/kg/h 
groups). 
Regarding  the  mean  time  to  awakening,  extubation,  stating  date  of  birth,  and  decision  to  exit  the 
operating  room,  propofol  showed  statistically  significant  shorter  time  compared  to  both  doses  of 
remimazolam. 
The mean (5 to 95 percentile points) optimal infusion rate during maintenance of anesthesia in the ONO-
2745  6  mg/kg/h  group  and  ONO-2745  12  mg/kg/h  group  was 0.97  (0.40  to  1.58)  and 0.99  (0.40  to 
2.00) mg/kg/h, respectively. 
The time (mean) from end of IMP administration to awakening, extubation, stating date of birth, and 
decision to exit the operating room in the ONO-2745 6 mg/kg/h group were 14.9, 19.2, 24.8 and 28.7 
minutes, respectively, and 14.5, 19.2, 24.1 and 27.9 minutes, respectively, in the ONO-2745 12 mg/kg/h 
group. In the propofol group (n=75), the mean time to awakening, extubation, stating date of birth, and 
decision to exit the operating room were 10.3, 13.1, 15.6 and 19.1 minutes, respectively, which were 
statistically significant shorter durations compared with both remimazolam groups. 
Study CNS7056-010 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with successful anaesthesia (defined a no 
use  of  rescue  of  sedative  medications).  By  that  definition,  anaesthesia  was  successful  in  all  patients 
except one in the remimazolam 12 mg/kg/h-induction group and one in the propofol/sevoflurane group.  
Assessment report  
EMA/79576/2023  
Page 90/129 
 
 
 
In general, time to events were shorter in the propofol/sevoflurane group than in the two remimazolam 
groups.  No  difference  was  observed  between  the  treatment  groups  regarding  time  to  discharge  from 
PACU/ICU  (approximately  27  hours)  and  time  to  discharge  from  hospital  (identical  95%CI  8-11  in  all 
treatment arms). 
Haemodynamic stability was investigated in this study. All patients were administered vasopressors and 
cardio-depressive effects were assessed using two specific safety endpoints: cardiac instability and low 
cardiac output syndrome (both composite outcomes). The incidence of cardiostability was higher in the 
pooled remimazolam group (27.4%) than in the propofol/sevoflurane group (14.3%). Between the two 
remimazolam  doses,  the  6  mg/kg/h  showed  higher  incidence  of  cardiostability  (35.3%)  than  the  12 
mg/kg/h (17.9%). During general anaesthesia (including recovery period until extubation), proportions 
of  patients  with  a  low  cardiac  output  syndrome  were  larger  in  the  propofol/sevoflurane  group  (25%) 
than in the pooled remimazolam group (14.5%) as well as 6 mg/kg/h and 12 mg/kg/h induction dose 
groups (14.7% and 14.3% respectively). 
Study ONO-2745-06 
The rate of efficacy for the functional capability of remimazolam as general anesthetic (defined as the 
absence  of  intraoperative  awakening/recall  and  requirement  of  rescue  sedation  and  body  movement) 
was 100% in both ONO-2745 6 and 12 mg/kg/h groups. 
2.6.7  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Loss of consciousness was achieved and maintained in nearly all patients receiving remimazolam during 
surgical  procedures.  Thus,  general  anaesthesia  was  achieved  (efficacy:  nearly  100%).  Based  on  the 
mechanism of action and the fact that the medicine was titrated to effect, this was expected.  
Time to onset of action appears to be shorter in remimazolam compared to propofol (although with some 
conflicting  results  in  the  two  pivotal  studies)  while  time  to  offset  is  consistently  shorter  in  propofol 
compared to remimazolam, as communicated in the SmPC (see section 5.1). 
Haemodynamic stability results are only formally evaluated in one study (the European pivotal study) 
and  the  conclusions  are  hampered  by  post-hoc  modifications  of  the  statistical  analysis  plan.  No 
superiority  of  remimazolam  over  propofol  on  the  account  of  haemodynamic  stability  can  be  firmly 
claimed.  
2.6.8  Clinical safety 
2.6.8.1  Patient exposure 
As detailed in the Table 48, a total of 783 patients received remimazolam across all GA studies, group 
C. 
Of these 783 patients 529 received low dose remimazolam for induction, whilst 254 received high dose 
remimazolam for induction.  
A total of 226 patients received propofol as comparison within group C.  
The mean cumulative dose of remimazolam was 255.61 mg ranging from a minimum of 14 mg up to a 
maximum of 1399 mg.  
The mean duration of exposure of remimazolam was 213.0 minutes, whilst the maximum exposure was 
682.9 minutes.  
The minimum duration of exposure was 3.9 minutes.

Pooling Strategy 
To allow a broader comparison of the safety of remimazolam, data was pooled across six GA studies. 
Studies were pooled into two different groups: group B, which included the controlled studies, and group 
C, which included all GA studies (please refer to the Table 51). Pool A was used for efficacy analyses 
only.  
All analyses are based on the safety (SAF) population, which is defined as all subjects who received at 
least one dose of remimazolam or active comparator and was evaluated as being treated.

A safety analysis of pool A (not initially provided) was performed upon request during the course of this 
procedure. While there are some expected differences between group A (cardiac surgery) and the pooled 
group B, the AE profile is not critically different, nor any higher frequency AE in cardiac surgery deserve 
mention, apart from the higher percentage of patients experiencing agitation on recovery from cardiac 
surgery as compared to the pooled surgeries. This may in fact be related to the higher use of flumazenil 
in cardiac surgery and is thus justified. 
Across both groups (B & C) the treatment groups for comparison include total remimazolam, low dose 
remimazolam  (6 mg/kg/h  or  6 mg/min),  high  dose  remimazolam  (12 mg/kg/h)  and  propofol.  ONO-

2745-03, within group C, also contained induction dose levels 4, 8, 21 and 30 mg/kg/hr. Data pertaining 
to  these  35  patients  is  not  included  in  the  analysis.  It  is  important  to  note  that  low  and  high  dose 
remimazolam pertains to the induction dose only, i.e. an infusion rate that was used during the first few 
minutes of treatment. The average cumulative dose for these two treatment groups was very similar. In 
general group C was used for comparison between treatment groups relating to study drug exposure, 
demographics  and  baseline  characteristics  and  group  B  for  TEAEs.  Unless  relating  to  induction, 
comparisons were made between total remimazolam and total propofol. All comparisons are based on 
the SAF unless specified. 
The safety database (including 783 patients) is not large enough to capture rare adverse events. That is 
a, given the expected widespread of use of remimazolam. 
2.6.8.2  Adverse events 
An overall summary of TEAEs for controlled studies in general anaesthesia is presented in the Table 52. 
The incidence of TEAEs was largely similar across the total propofol and remimazolam groups.

The  incidence  of  mild,  moderate  or  severe  TEAEs  is  also  similar  across  total  remimazolam  and  total 
propofol groups.  
Only one severe TEAE occurred with a frequency of >1%, pleural effusion, and predominantly in studies 
where cardiac surgeries were performed. These TEAEs are likely to be secondary to the patient’s medical 
history or surgical procedure. All other severe TEAEs occurred with a low frequency, and with a similar 
incidence between remimazolam and propofol group. 
As the incidence of TEAEs in the total remimazolam and total propofol group was generally similar, a 
meaningful comparison of the relationship with the study drug can be made accordingly between these 
two groups. The incidence of related or not related TEAEs represents the percentage proportion of any 
TEAE for that particular treatment group. As it can be seen in the Table 52, there were a greater number 
of  subjects  with  related  TEAEs  in  the  total  propofol  group  [151  (66.8%)]  in  comparison  to  the  total 
remimazolam group [357 ( 53.2%)].

Slightly more TEAEs led to discontinuation of the study drug in the total remimazolam group [5 (0.7%)] 
in comparison to the total propofol group [1 (0.4%)]. These TEAEs in the total remimazolam group were 
post procedural haemorrhage, vascular access site occlusion, cough, haemothorax and hypotension and, 
in the total propofol group, the TEAE was hypotension.  
Common Adverse Events 
TEAEs that occurred at an incidence of ≥1% in controlled trials in general anaesthesia are presented in 
the Table 53. In most cases, the incidence of these events in remimazolam patients was similar, or lower, 
than  that  observed  in  propofol  patients.  For  any  event  that  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  total 
remimazolam group than in the total propofol groups, the difference in incidence between the groups 
was <5%. 
The  most  common  TEAEs  in  the  total  remimazolam  group  (>5%)  by  preferred  term  (PT)  were: 
hypotension  (25.0%),  blood  pressure  decreased  (20.1%),  nausea  (14.2%),  bradycardia  (10.1%), 
vomiting  (9.7%),  pleural  effusion  (9.7%),  procedural  nausea  (7.9%),  wound  complications  (6.9%), 
hypertension  (6.4%),  procedural  vomiting  (5.5%),  pyrexia  (5.5%),  chills  (5.5%),  and  postoperative 
anaemia (5.4%).

PTs  relating  to  haemodynamic  changes  were  the  ones  most  commonly  observed:  blood  pressure 
decreased, hypotension and bradycardia. The incidence was lower in the total remimazolam groups in 
comparison to the total propofol groups: hypotension 25.0% vs 34.1%; blood pressure decreased 20.1% 
vs 25.5%; bradycardia 10.1% vs 17.3%, in remimazolam versus propofol groups, respectively. 
Nausea  (14.2%  vs.  11.5%)  and  vomiting  (9.7%  vs  5.8%)  were  the  only  PTs  where  there  was  a 
substantially  higher  incidence  in  the  remimazolam  treatment  groups  in  comparison  to  the  propofol 
groups. 
Within  the  general  anaesthesia  line  extension,  large  parts  of  efficacy  involved  a  comparison  between 
treatment arms within group A. Safety comparisons were generally made between treatment arms in 
group  B.  Comparisons  between  the  treatment  arms  in  group A  were  not made, as  these  patients  are 
included  in  group  B,  and  it  is  expected  that  the  frequencies  of  Treatment  Emergent  Adverse  Events 
(TEAEs) is likely to be similar in group A and group B. 
A comparison of the TEAEs in group A and group B is provided below. 
Overview of TEAEs 
Overall frequency of any TEAE and of drug related TEAEs was similar in group A and group B, but there 
were less mild and more moderate to severe TEAEs in group B (please see the Table 54). The difference 
between  group  A  and  B  are  the  CNS7056-10  and  CNS7056-11  trials,  performed  in  cardiac  surgery. 
Accordingly,  in  group  B  it  can  be  expected  a  similar  overall  frequency,  but  more  moderate  or  severe 
TEAEs, especially related to cardiac diseases. 
A common TEAE within studies CNS7056-10 and CNS7056-11 was pleural effusion, a known complication 
of cardiac surgery (Labidi et al), which accounted for the majority of the differences in the moderate and 
severe TEAEs between group A and group B. 
Assessment report  
EMA/79576/2023  
Page 99/129 
 
 
 
 
One additional case of a TEAE, leading to withdrawal of study medication was observed in group B. This 
was seen in CNS7056-10. One patient experienced a TEAE of hemothorax that started 90 minutes after 
the  end  of  the  elective  surgical  procedure.  The  TEAE  was  assessed  as  serious  due  to  the  need  for 
immediate  medical  intervention.  Intensity  was  assessed  as  life-threatening.  The  serious  TEAE  was 
assessed as not related to the study medication, permanently discontinued because of this serious TEAE, 
for which the subject required a re-operation with another general anaesthesia (of note: CNS7056-010 
study protocol included continuation of remimazolam for sedation at Intensive Care Unit up to 24 hours, 
but not the use of study medication for re-surgery after the elective surgical procedure had ended). The 
patient recovered completely from this serious TEAE.

The incidence of TEAEs of the SOC (System Organ Class) GI disorders, investigations, nervous system, 
renal and urinary system, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, and vascular system disorders were 
similar between group A and group B.  
The SOCs with a higher incidence in group B in comparison to group A were cardiac disorders, respiratory, 
thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders,  blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders,  general  disorders  and 
administration  site  conditions,  injury,  poisoning  and  procedural  complications  and  Metabolism  and 
nutrition disorders, and psychiatric disorders. The difference in incidences ranged from 4.4 - 9.8%.  
A  higher  incidence  of  TEAEs  for  the  SOC  cardiac  disorders  and  respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal 
disorders was observed in group B in comparison to group A. Considering that the additional studies in 
group B are all cardiac surgeries, this is an expected finding.  
A higher incidence of blood and lymphatic system disorders was observed in group B in comparison to 
group A. The TEAEs which were observed with a higher incidence in group B in comparison to group A 
were  blood  loss  anaemia  (16  [2.4%]  vs  0  [0%]),  coagulopathy  (7  [1%]  vs  0  [0%]),  leukocytosis  (8 
[1.25%] vs 1 [0.3%]) and thrombocytopaenia (13 [1.9%] vs 3 [0.5%]) respectively. These findings are 
consistent with the use of extracorporeal circulatory circuits in cardiac surgery (Watel et al) and blood 
loss.  
Assessment report  
EMA/79576/2023  
Page 100/129 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  higher  incidence  of  general  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  seen  in  group  B  in 
comparison to group A is due to higher frequencies of TEAEs chills (37 [5.5%] vs 25 [4.2%]), oedema 
(11  [1.6%]  vs  1  [0.2%])  and  therapeutic  product  effect  prolonged  (33  [4.9%]  vs  21  [3.6%]) 
respectively. Reducing body temperature to protect the myocardium is commonly used in cardiac surgery 
(Saad et al) and is the likely reason contributing to a higher incidence of chills. The type of oedema was 
not  specified.  Ankle  oedema  secondary  to  cardiac  impairment  is  more  likely  in  patients  undergoing 
cardiac surgery, who are likely to have a degree of cardiac impairment.  
The differences between group B and group A for the SOC injury, poisoning and procedural complications 
conditions were due to the TEAEs postoperative anaemia (36 [5.4%] vs 3 [0.5%]), procedural nausea 
(53 [7.9%] vs 21 [3.6%]) and procedural vomiting (37 [5.5%] vs 12 [2.0%]). As highlighted above, it 
appears  that  a  greater  blood  loss  was  observed  in  CNS7056-010  and  CNS7056-011.  This  would  help 
explain the increase in postoperative anaemia. The high incidence of nausea and vomiting is discussed 
further in this assessment report. 
For the SOC Metabolism and nutrition disorders the PT which predominantly contributed to the higher 
incidence in group B in comparison to group A was fluid retention (22 [3.3%] vs 0 [0.0%], respectively). 
A large number of patients enrolled in studies CNS7056-10 and CNS7056-11 had a pre-existing history 
of heart failure; fluid retention is a known clinical sign within this population.  
The  difference  in  incidence  in  Musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders  between  group B  and 
group A  was  due  to  back  pain  (20  [3.0%]  vs  0  [0.0%],  respectively).  Cardiac  surgeries  tend  involve 
patients lying supine for prolonged periods: the long duration in a single position is the most likely cause 
of back pain.    
For the SOC psychiatric disorders the TEAE agitation accounted for the difference between group B and 
group A (33 [4.9%] vs 0 [0.0%], respectively). Study CNS7056-10 accounted for the majority of patients 
that experienced agitation. A high incidence of flumazenil use was observed within this study: agitation 
is a known side effect of flumazenil and likely explains the high incidence of agitation in these patients.  
In  general  all  these  differences  are  accountable  to  the  special  population  of  patients  with  cardiac 
diseases.  This  support’s  the  claim,  that  the  safety  profile  built  based  on  group  B  is  also  applicable  to 
group A. 
2.6.8.3  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
There were no TEAEs with an outcome of death. Although no patients died during the observation periods 
of the GA studies, 1 patient in study CNS7056-022, randomised to propofol, died from a complex leakage 
of a major artery, approximately 1 month after completing the study. This was considered unrelated to 
the study treatment. 
Other Serious Adverse Events 
Overall, the incidence of serious TEAEs was slightly higher in the total propofol group in comparison to 
the total remimazolam group.  
When comparing the SOC/PTs, the incidence of serious TEAEs was similar across the treatment groups. 
The SOC with the highest incidence of serious, TEAEs in both the total remimazolam and propofol group, 
was injury, poisoning and procedural complications which occurred in 2.7% of patients in both groups. 
Within this SOC, the PT with the highest incidence in both treatment groups was postoperative delirium, 
occurring  in  1.0%  of  all  total  remimazolam  patients  and  1.3%  of  total  propofol  patients.  This  slightly 
higher incidence in the propofol group is in contrast to the incidence of non-serious postoperative delirium 
seen  across  the  treatment  groups,  where  there  was  a  higher  incidence  in  total  remimazolam  group 
Assessment report  
EMA/79576/2023  
Page 101/129 
 
 
 
(2.4%) in comparison to the propofol group (1.3%). Postoperative delirium is a serious complication of 
GA, associated with a 30-day mortality of 7-10% (Jin, 2020). Its aetiology is multifactorial, and is most 
prevalent in older patients, those with existing neurocognitive disorders and those undergoing complex 
or emergency procedures. It is also noted that the choice of anaesthetic does not contribute to the risk 
of delirium.  
Postoperative delirium is the only SAE PT with an incidence ≥1% in either the remimazolam or propofol 
group.A comparison of the frequency of severe TEAEs across group A and group B has also been looked 
at and noted  as higher in group B (11%) than in group A (5%). Except for pleural effusion, which (as 
discussed above) is a known complication of cardiac surgery, the increase in severe TEAEs in group B 
cannot be attributed to a single PT and is likely to be representative of the surgery and the underlying 
patient characteristics. 
Overview of serious TEAEs 
A  comparison  of  the  frequency  of  serious  TEAEs  between  group  A  and  group  B  by  SOC  revealed  an 
incidence  approximately  2%  higher  in  group  B  in  comparison  to  group  A.  Where  differences  exist  in 
serious  TEAEs  related  to  the  SOC,  these  are  reflective  of  the  nature  of  the  surgery  and  the  patients 
enrolled (i.e. a higher frequency of serious SAEs for the SOCs cardiac disorders and respiratory, thoracic 
and mediastinal disorders in group B).  
Protocol design and pharmacokinetic considerations 
According  to  the  study  protocols  for  all  studies  with  two  remimazolam  induction  doses,  the  induction 
period  extended  for  some  minutes  only  versus  a  maintenance  period,  which  often  lasted  for  hours. 
Although there is a difference between the induction doses, the allowed range for the maintenance dose 
was  identical  for  all  these  studies.  Therefore,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  differences  between  the 
induction doses during the comparably short induction period have a minor and negligible effect on the 
quality of anesthesia during the maintenance period and subsequently, the duration of the maintenance 
period, in the case of the administration of a fast-acting drug, like remimazolam with half-lives of some 
minutes only and no relevant cumulative effect. 
These data indicate that in trials that included a randomized allocation of patients to either the low or 
the high remimazolam induction dose there were no notable differences in 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the  level  of  anaesthesia  even  early  on  during  maintenance  indicating  that  the  extent  of 
anaesthesia from the start of maintenance did not differ 
the  average  duration  of  surgery/maintenance,  indicating  that  there  were  no  complications 
prolonging the surgery time 
the  maintenance  dose,  indicating  that  anaesthetic  requirements  were  not  greater  in  the  low-
dose remimazolam group 
the incidence of adverse drug reactions, indicating that neither a low nor a high dose presented 
a  safety  issue  and  confirming  that  the  efficacy  and  safety  were  mainly  determined  by  the 
maintenance dose rather than the induction dose. 
This is supported by the known pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics i.e. a short alpha 
and beta half-life and a rapid keo which result in rapid changes of plasma and effect site concentrations 
following dose adaptations and a rapid corresponding change in the level of sedation/anaesthesia. 
In summary, the data presented did not reveal sufficient evidence for an association between the low-
dose  induction  dose  of  remimazolam  and  the  duration  of  the  maintenance.  Moreover,  all  intra-study 
comparisons  between  low-dose  and  high-dose  remimazolam  induction  doses  revealed  similar  results. 
Since the observation made for pooled group C could not be confirmed to be methodologically superior 
Assessment report

Page 102/129 
 
 
 
intra-study  comparisons,  these  observations  are  considered  not  attributable  to  the  remimazolam 
induction dose regimen. 
There  was  a  clinically  significant  higher  frequency  of  nausea  and  particularly  of  vomiting  in  the 
remimazolam arm as compared to propofol. This might be of special concern in situations where Valsalva 
manoeuvres  are  to  be  avoided.  The  review  and  assessment  of  the  detailed  circumstances  in  which 
postoperative  vomiting  occurred  did  not  reveal  any  relevant  differences  between  remimazolam  and 
propofol. Applying scientifically accepted risk factors onto those patients that experienced PONV revealed 
no  relevant  differences  in  distribution  of  those  risk  factors  in  both  groups  and  thus  confirmed  the 
assessment from the review in detail. Moreover, the risk factors revealed a high predictive value for both 
groups – remimazolam and propofol- and thus, further confirmed the applicability of general risk factors 
for  PONV  also  for  remimazolam  exposure.  In  particular,  there  was  no  evidence  to  suggest  any 
characteristic  which  would  foster  PONV  solely  for  remimazolam.  The  percentage  of  patients  in  which 
vomiting occurred as well as the percentage of patients in which a Valsalva manoeuvre should have been 
avoided are not statistically different between remimazolam and propofol, confirming the absence of a 
relevant  difference  between  these  two  compounds  with  regards  to  a)  Frequency  of  postoperative 
vomiting; b) Risk factors for PONV and c) Avoidance of Valsalva maneouvres. 
2.6.8.4  Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
The incidence of markedly abnormal haematology was very low in all groups. Across all treatment groups 
there were no changes from baseline to follow-up which represented any concern. 
Blood Chemistry  
In  general  the  incidence  of  markedly  abnormal  blood  chemistry  results  was  low  and  there  were  no 
changes from baseline to follow-up which represented any concern. A small increase in the number of 
patients experiencing a markedly abnormal creatinine kinase was observed across all groups at follow-
up. This is a common finding with surgical procedures and not considered to be treatment related. 
A substantial increase in the number of patients that experienced a markedly abnormal protein was seen 
at follow-up (protein <5.0 g/dL). The incidence appeared similar across the total remimazalom group 
and the total propofol group. However, the increase was greater in the high-dose remimazolam group 
and  likely  to  be  related  to  a  dilution  effect  representing  a  fall  in  protein  concentration  due  to 
administration of IV fluids rather than a fall in the absolute protein level. 
Urinalysis 
The  FDA’s  Toxicity  Grading  Scale  for  Healthy  Adult  and  Adolescent  Volunteers  Enrolled  in  Preventive 
Vaccine  Clinical  Trials  document  provides  severity  classification  for  3  urinary  parameters.  These  are 
glucose,  occult  blood  and  protein.  The  incidence  of  patients  experiencing  markedly  abnormal  urinary 
protein and glucose was low. 
It was noted that an increased number of patients experienced markedly abnormal occult blood within 
the urine at follow-up, predominantly in study ONO-2745-05. A deeper review of available data indicated 
only increased erythrocytes or positive urine occult blood testing, but not findings of casts. This made a 
renal cause of the haematuria unlikely and that the bladder or urethra are more likely to be the source 
of the bleeding. Urinary catheterisation is a common cause of post-operative haematuria. Post-operative 
catheterisation, to check for adequate urine production or urine retention, is considered an important 
element of post-operative nursing care. It is possible that such catheterisations are mentioned only in 
nursing notes and not registered routinely in clinical study documentation. Also, catheterisation during 
surgery  may  not  have  always  been  documented.  This  makes  it  difficult  to  assess  how  often 
Assessment report  
EMA/79576/2023  
Page 103/129 
 
 
 
catheterisation may have occurred in the different studies during or after surgery. Benzodiazepines can 
have  some  muscle  relaxant  effects, which  may  reduce  the  ability  to  empty  the  bladder.  Opiates  may 
reduce the sensation of bladder fullness. This combination of drug effects in post-surgical subjects could 
result in single bladder catheterisation. Therefore, this finding was not thought to be treatment related. 
As  requested,  the  MAH  elaborated  further  on  the  amount  of  evidence  clearly  relating  haematuria  to 
catheterization due to urinary retention, confirming that a signal of microscopic haematuria had arisen 
mainly from one trial (ONO-2745-05), but a final conclusion could not be made on the initial analysis 
due to limited data collected. Other studies in GA did not provide significant support for this signal. 
The subsequent GA study CNS7056-022 collected additional information on microscopic haematuria in a 
structured way (and also data on catheterisation). These data did not show a significant difference in 
incidence of microscopic haematuria between treatment groups at any time. The study documented that 
incidence of clinically non-significant microscopic haematuria in surgery patients was approximately 23% 
prior  to  surgery  and  increased  to  57%  to  63%  and  62%  to  64%,  on  days  1  and  2,  for  propofol  and 
remimazolam,  respectively,  after  surgery,  with  no  increase  in  the  number  of  subjects  with  clinically 
significant  haematuria.  Approximately  80%  of  the  study  population  received  urinary  catheterisation 
during surgery, with no significant difference between treatment groups. Other recent studies also did 
not provide evidence supporting a signal. With no evidence supporting any direct effect of remimazolam 
on urinary tract inflammation or crystallisation, no evidence suggesting a renal origin of haematuria, and 
with the hypothesis that some of the identified cases of microscopic haematuria may have resulted from 
surgical or early post-surgical bladder catheterisation, as part of routine anaesthesia, or post-surgical 
nursing  case,  the  signal  was  considered  refuted  and  closed.  In  conclusion,  it  is  agreed  on  insufficient 
information to support a signal. 
Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety 
Vital Signs 
The  mean  arterial  pressure  (MAP)  values  and  vasopressor  use  in  remimazolam  and  propofol  patients 
were explored to assess remimazolam haemodynamic stability over propofol. 
Mean Arteral Pressure (MAP) following remimazolam and propofol use 
A  decrease  in  MAP  <  65  mmHg  is  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  myocardial  and  kidney  injury 
(Salmasi et all, 2017). Therefore, this threshold was chosen to make comparisons between remimazolam 
and  propofol.  The  haemodynamic  profile  of  remimazolam,  based  on  patients  MAP,  was  assessed  and 
compared against propofol, applying the reverse adjusted AUC method (RAAUC), a measure for duration 
and extent of MAP drop below the threshold of 65mmHg. Comparisons were made for extended induction, 
surgical  intervention  and  recovery.  Extended  induction  refers  to  the  period  between  start  of  study 
medication and first skin incision.  
Assessment of MAP AUC based on intrinsic factors 
In  adults  (<  65)  and  elderly  patients  between  65-74  years  remimazolam  demonstrated  statistically 
significant haemodynamic superiority over propofol across all 3 phases of anaesthesia. In the category, 
75-84 the RAAUC was lower in the remimazolam group in comparison to the propofol group across all 
phases of anaesthesia. Although the difference was similar to that seen in the younger age groups, this 
did not reach statistical significance, probably because of the lower sample size. The oldest age group, 
> 85 contained too few patients to allow any comparison of the data.  
A  pre-existing  history  of  hypertension  greatly  increased  the  risk  of  patients  developing  intraoperative 
hypotensive  events.  Hypertension  is  not  considered  to  be  a  risk  factor  for  haemodynamic  instability 
during  the  perioperative  period.  These  findings  are  most  likely  explained  by  the  patients  anti-
hypertensive medication, which continue to exert its effect during the perioperative period. 
Assessment report  
EMA/79576/2023  
Page 104/129 
 
 
 
Assessment of MAP AUC based on extrinsic factors 
The patient cohort receiving antihypertensive medications are generally the same as the hypertensive 
patients  highlighted.  As  a  consequence,  a  similar  finding  of  greatly  increased  risk  of  intra-operative 
hypotensive  events  in  patients  who  were  on  anti-hypertensives  was  observed.  Remimazolam 
demonstrated  statistically  significant  higher  haemodynamic  stability 
in  patients 
receiving 
antihypertensive and/or beta-blockers across all phases of GA in comparison to propofol. A similar finding 
was also seen in patients who were not using these medications. 
Findings for vasopressor use across the different age categories was similar to the RAAUC for MAP < 65 
years.  Vasopressor  use  was  greater  in  patients  < 65 years  and  in  patients  between  65-74 years  who 
received propofol. This finding is similar in adults > 75 years but, due to lower numbers, it could not be 
confirmed statistically. Findings of vasopressor use across ASA status was similar to those for RAAUC for 
MAP  under  65 mmHg.  Vasopressor  use  increased  with  higher  ASA scores  for  both  propofol  and 
remimazolam.

Intrinsic Factors 
Demographics 
An  overall  review  of  the  TEAE’s  was  performed  to  determine  if  there  was  evidence  of  a  differential 
response  to  treatment  in  the  drug-demographic  interaction  subgroups;  age,  sex,  race,  ASA-PS 
classification, and weight/BMI.  
Based on their relevance within GA, the following SMQs and CMQs were selected for comparison within 
subgroups: 
•  Cardiac disorders: bradycardia 
•  Vascular disorders: hypotension 
•  Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: hypoxia 
•  Agitation & Delirium 
Age 
In general, the incidences of these TEAEs was higher in elderly patients (≥65 year of age) in comparison 
to younger ones (<65 years of age). This was consistent in both remimazolam and propofol groups, with 
the exception of agitation and delirium, where incidence appeared similar both in elderly and younger 
patients,  in  the  total  remimazolam  and  total  propofol  groups.  The  incidence  of  TEAE’s  in  the  age 
group ≥85 years was low, perhaps due to the small number of patients included within this age group. 
The  MAH  has  outlined  the  main  characteristics  of  the  efficacy  and  safety  profile  of  remimazolam  in 
different age groups and provided a benefit-risk assessment for use of this drug in the elderly, with focus 
on specific potential risks, such as cognitive and cardiovascular effects, and the influence on renal and 
hepatic function, as detailed further i.e. in different subsections of this assessment report.  
Ultimately,  it  is  agreed  that,  as  the  elderly  would  be  more  sensitive  to  the  effects  of  anaesthetics,  a 
careful assessment of the overall condition of patients ≥ 65 years is of particular relevance when deciding 
Assessment report

upon  individualised  dose  adjustments  (see  SmPC  section  4.2,  4.4)  and  the  starting  dose  should  be 
considered at the lower range.  
An  increase  in  recovery  times  with  age  was  observed  across  all  evaluated  recovery  endpoints. 
Furthermore, age had more effect on the recovery time of propofol patients, compared to remimazolam. 
There  was  no  clear  sign  that  the  elderly  population  has  a  higher  risk  with  remimazolam  than  with 
propofol. As compared to those <65 years, the increased risk in those aged 65-74 is within the expected 
values, as it is also the subsequent stabilisation in the patients aged 75-84 and slight decrease in the 
very old one (>85 years).  
Sex 
When  comparing  total  remimazolam  group  with  total  propofol  group  the  incidence  of  hypoxia  and 
hypotension were similar across males and females. For bradycardia, the incidence was greater in males 
dosed  with  propofol.  A  similar  effect  was  also  seen  in  the  total  remimazolam  group;  however  this 
difference was less substantial.  
Agitation and delirium was also more prevalent in males. This effect was seen in both total remimazolam 
and propofol groups, however, was greater in the remimazolam group. The effect was seen in both low 
and high dose remimazolam groups but was more obvious in the high-dose group. The presence of post-
operative  agitation  is  multifactorial  and  probably  not  remimazolam  related.  Therefore,  no  dosing 
adjustments are required between sexes to prevent agitation or delirium. 
BMI 
The incidence of TEAEs across the BMI categories were similar when the total all remimazolam group 
was compared to propofol. It was also noted the risk of hypoxia increased as the BMI increased. This 
was consistent across both groups, though the incidence of hypoxia was slightly lower across all weight 
categories within the remimazolam group. The increased risk of hypoxia with higher weights is likely to 
be secondary to obstructive sleep apnoea, the risk of which increases with increasing weight. 
Prolonged sedation was more common with remimazolam than propofol. This has occurred with older 
and heavier patients.  
There is indeed an age effect when evaluating the recovery characteristics of remimazolam, i.e. older 
patients seem to take longer to recover than young subjects. This was visible in the analysis of prolonged 
sedation  as  a  TEAE,  as  well  as  in  the  analysis  of  recovery  endpoints  such  as  time  to  orientation. 
Interestingly, the same effect was seen for propofol, and for some parameters the age effect of propofol 
was more pronounced, resulting in a similar recovery time between the two drugs in elderly. For example, 
the median time to orientation increased with age from 20.0 min (<65 years) to 25.0 min (>85 years) 
for  remimazolam  while  for  propofol  the  increase  was  from  14.0 min  (<65 years)  to  25.0 min 
(>85 years).  
The  incidence  of  prolonged  sedation,  as  assessed  by  the  CMQ prolonged  sedation,  increased  to  some 
extent with body weight (Table 55) and BMI (Table 56). The extent of increase for both, remimazolam 
and  propofol  was  somewhat  similar  for  both  factors  (i.e.  body  weight  and  BMI).  While  propofol 
accumulates in fat remimazolam does not. Thus, in the MAH’s opinion there was no clear evidence for a 
special role of fat tissue (e.g. as a tissue in which drug accumulates and is slowly released after end of 
drug  administration)  in  the  phenomenon  of  prolonged  sedation.  The  MAH  concluded  that  there  is  no 
higher risk for obese versus high body weight patients to experience prolonged sedation.

There  seemed  to  exist  a  delay  in  recovery  for  overweight  plus  patients.  The  MAH  stated  that  the 
behaviour is similar to propofol which can be agreed to, but the rationale was not clearly understood. 
With remimazolam there is a clear increase in the frequency of patients with prolonged sedation more 
related to high BMI than to the weight itself.  
As detailed below, the MAH proposed several justifications for the prolonged sedation observed in obese 
patients, considered plausible by the CHMP. 
In the MAH’s view, it is unlikely a direct causal relation between the increased incidence of prolonged 
sedation in overweight or obese patients exist. Instead, there appears to be confounding factors which 
should be considered when interpreting the results: 
1.  Confounding effect of Japanese studies 
GA trials were conducted in Japan and Europe. Across the different trials, the BMI of the study population 
was  comparable  to  that  of  the  general  population  in  the  respective  countries  of  origin.  However,  as 
outlined  in  the  Table  57 the  BMI  of  Japanese  subjects  was  generally  lower  than  the  BMI of  European 
subjects,  with  a  mean  BMI  ranging  from  22.70  -  23.25  kg/m2  for  Japanese  subjects  (remimazolam 
group), compared to a mean BMI of 26.25 - 27.74 kg/m2 for European subjects (remimazolam group). 
The incidence of prolonged sedation in the Japanese cohort is considerably lower than in the European 
cohort, with only one AE related to prolonged sedation (incidence of 0.3%) being reported in a Japanese 
trial. Hence, a predominantly regional effect would be noted (i.e. more reporting of prolonged sedation 
in European as compared to Japanese clinical trials). In support of this, there was no body weight effect 
observed within the European study population. The mean BMI of patients with prolonged sedation was 
27.35 kg/m2 (study CNS7056-010) and 25.72 kg/m2 (study CNS7056-022), compared to 26.88 kg/m2 
and 27.74 kg/m2, respectively, for patients without prolonged sedation. 
Therefore,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  on  average  lower  body  weight  in  Japanese  trials  (where  also 
reporting of prolonged sedation was less) has a confounding effect on the interpretation of a potential 
correlation of body weight with an increased risk of prolonged sedation.

Table 57: Mean body weight, BMI, and incidence of prolonged sedation by study – Group C – 
PP 
2.  Association between higher ASA score and age with increased incidence of prolonged sedation 
ASA III/IV patients in the study population had a higher BMI than ASA I/II patients, as demonstrated 
in the Table 58. The mean BMI of ASA III/IV patients was 26.93 kg/m2 compared to a mean BMI of 
23.55 kg/m2 in ASA I/II patients. 
In general, ASA III/IV patients with prolonged sedation had comparable body weights and BMIs as 
those who did not experience prolonged sedation. 
Patients  with  an  age  of  65  years  and  older  had,  on  average,  a  higher  body  weight  and  BMI  than 
those younger than 65 years. At the same time, the incidence of prolonged sedation increased with 
age (Table 57). 
There is a known association between higher ASA class and higher age, with an increased incidence 
of prolonged sedation. Thus, it is likely that the higher incidence of AEs related to prolonged sedation 
in obese patients was a coincidental finding, as the majority of these subjects also had higher ASA 
class (III-IV) and older age.

3.  Effects of obesity on remimazolam pharmacokinetics 
A potential causal relationship could result from an effect of body weight or BMI on clearance. This 
was  investigated  in  several  PK  and  PK/PD  models  using  different  remimazolam  datasets.  Overall, 
there  was  no  consistent  effect  of  body  weight  or  BMI  on  clearance.  In  one  dataset  of  patients 
undergoing general anaesthesia there was an increased clearance with increasing body weight. Such 
an  effect  would  be  counterintuitive  for  a  potential  causal  relationship  of  body  weight  on  recovery 
times by a prolongation of the elimination half-life (i.e. a reduction in clearance). 
4.  Effects of obesity on remifentanil pharmacokinetics 
While the pharmacokinetics of remimazolam are independent of body weight, as described above, 
this  is  not  the  case  for  remifentanil,  a  short-acting  opioid  administered  concomitantly  with 
Assessment report  
EMA/79576/2023  
Page 109/129 
 
 
 
 
remimazolam  in  the  pivotal  phase  III  trials,  and  which  acts  synergistically  with  remimazolam.  As 
clearance of remifentanil is significantly decreased in obese patients, consequently, the synergistic 
effects  of  remifentanil  on  remimazolam  could  be  prolonged  in  obese  patients,  contributing  to  an 
apparent association of increased body weight with prolonged sedation.  
Race 
The vast majority of subjects were either white or Asian. Black or other ethnicity account for a very small 
proportion of patients, therefore it was difficult to make comparisons and draw conclusions from these 
groups.  
Overall, the incidence of hypoxia, hypotension, bradycardia and agitation & delirium seemed to be lower 
in  Asian  patients  in  comparison  to  white  patients.  This  difference  is  thought  to  be  secondary  to  the 
different clinical trial designs rather than race differences. PAION sponsored trials conducted in Europe 
were largely made up of white patients. For these studies there were strict criteria based on vital signs 
for capturing hypoxia or hypotension as TEAEs, while this approach was not utilised for studies conducted 
in Japan. Therefore, no difference in dosing recommendations based on race is required for the purposes 
of GA. 
The incidence of agitation and delirium was also greater in white patients in comparison to Asian patients. 
This was consistent across all remimazolam groups and propofol groups. However, this finding appeared 
most obvious in the high dose remimazolam group. 
ASA Physical Status Classification 
There was a general trend for higher incidences of hypoxia, hypotension, bradycardia and agitation & 
delirium, in patients with ASA-PS >II than those with ASA-PS I-II in all treatment groups. The Japanese 
pivotal study accounts for the majority of ASA I/II patients whilst the European pivotal study accounts 
for the majority of ASA III/IV patients. Therefore, within treatment groups, the differences between ASA 
subgroups is likely explained by the differences in trial design and reporting of AEs.  
In  ASA I/II  patients  remimazolam  appears  to  be  associated  with  a  reduced  risk  of  hypotension  in 
comparison  to  propofol.  Though  this  is  not  seen  in  ASA III/IV  patients,  it  is  important  to  note  that 
haemodynamic stability over propofol has been demonstrated in these patients in study CNS7056-022, 
which accounts for the majority of patients in ASA III/IV group, where remimazolam was associated with 
a reduced risk of hypoxia and bradycardia.  
Hepatic Impairment 
The PK/PD effects of remimazolam in subjects with hepatic impairment were evaluated in the Phase I 
Study  ONO-2745IVU007.  In  this  open-label,  single  dose  IV  administration  study,  eight patients  with 
moderate  hepatic  impairment  (score  of  7  to  9  on  the  Child-Pugh  scale)  and  nine healthy  matched 
subjects, as well as three patients with severe hepatic impairment (score of 10 to 15 on the Child-Pugh 
scale) received remimazolam as a single IV bolus at 0.1 mg/kg infused over 1 minute after fasting for 
at least 10 hours. 
Duration of sedation and time for recovery from sedative effects were longer for patients with hepatic 
impairment  compared  to  healthy  control  subjects.  The  average  duration  of  loss  of  consciousness  was 
1.6, 3.2, and 2.0 minutes in healthy, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment, respectively. Time to 
recovery  was  8.0,  12.1,  and  16.7 minutes  in  healthy,  moderate,  and  severe  hepatic  impairment, 
respectively. 
Doses at the lower end of the dose ranges appear to be more appropriate in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment,  where  no  dose  adjustments  are  needed  for  subjects  with  mild  or  moderate  hepatic 
impairment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/79576/2023

In  controlled  clinical  trials  in  general  anaesthesia,  assessment  of  hepatic  function  was  based  on  total 
bilirubin (TBil) and AST: 
•  Normal liver function (TBil ≤1.5ULN and AST ≤ULN) 
•  Mild liver disfunction (TBil ≤1.5 ULN and AST >ULN) 
•  Moderate liver disfunction (TBil >1.5-3.0 x ULN and AST any) 
•  Severe liver disfunction (TBil >3.0 x ULN and AST any) 
There  were  37  remimazolam  patients  with  mild  hepatic  impairment  and  five  with  moderate  hepatic 
impairment. Of the propofol patients there were 16 patients with mild hepatic impairment and three with 
moderate hepatic impairment. There were no patients with severe hepatic impairment. In the category, 
mild hepatic impairment, there was a reduced incidence of hypotension in the total remimazolam group 
(n=21,  [57%])  vs  the  propofol  group  (n=12  [75%]).  The  incidence  of  the  remaining  special  interest 
TEAEs was similar across the total remimazolam and propofol group. There were too few patients within 
the moderate hepatic impairment category to be able to draw any firm conclusions. 
Ultimately,  having  considered  all  available  data,  it  is  agreed  that  no  dose  adjustment  is  required  in 
patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. In patients with severe hepatic impairment, as the 
clinical effects may be more pronounced and last longer than in healthy subjects, no dose adjustments 
are also required, but careful attention should be paid to the timing of titration doses and remimazolam 
titrated  accordingly  to  the  effect  in  these  patients  (see  SmPC  section  4.2,  4.4,  4.8,  5.2):  severe 
impairment  of  hepatic  function  resulted  in  a  reduced  clearance  and,  as  a  consequence,  a  prolonged 
recovery  from  sedation  was  confirmed.  These  patients  may  also  be  more  susceptible  to  respiratory 
depression. 
Renal Impairment 
The PK/PD effects of remimazolam in subjects with renal impairment were evaluated in Phase I Study 
CNS7056-012.  In  this  open-label  PK  and  safety  study,  a  single  IV  dose  of  1.5 mg  remimazolam  was 
administered to: 
•  12  subjects  with  normal  renal  function  (10 subjects  with  estimated  glomerular  filtration  rate 
[eGFR] ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 2 with eGFR of 80 to 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) 
•  11  subjects  with  end-stage  renal  disease  (ESRD)  not  on  dialysis  (6 subjects  with  eGFR  of 
15 to 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 5 subjects with eGFR of <15 mL/min/1.73 m2). 
The concentration-time profile and PK after a single IV dose of 1.5 mg IV remimazolam did not show 
relevant differences in ESRD subjects compared to subjects with normal renal function. The excretion of 
the main metabolite CNS7054 however was prolonged in subjects with renal impairment. However, due 
to its pharmacological inactivity, no changes in dosing are required. 
In controlled trials in general anaesthesia, the incidence of TEAEs of interest was assessed in patients 
with renal impairment. These were classified as follows: 
•  Normal renal function – >90 mL/min/1.73 m2   
•  Mild renal impairment – 60-90 mL/min/1.73 m2 
•  Moderate renal impairment – 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2 
•  Severe renal impairment – <30 mL/min/1.73 m2  
In general there was an increased incidence of hypoxia, hypotension and bradycardia with decreasing 
renal function. This was probably more related to a decrease in the overall health condition that comes

with  decreased  renal  function  rather  than  a  direct effect.  This mirrors  the  findings  for  worsening  ASA 
status.  For  agitation  and  delirium  no  trends  were  observed  across  any  of  the  treatment  groups.  As 
outlined  in  SmPC  section  4.2,  the  results  from  the  controlled  GA  studies  also  confirm  that  no  dose 
adjustment is required for renal impairment, including ESRD patients. 
Co-morbid conditions 
The  data  was  analysed  to  determine  if  there  were  any  trends  in  TEAEs  of  special  interest  following 
exposure to remimazolam and propofol in patients with the following pre-existing medical histories: 
•  Hypertension  
•  Cardiac dysfunction  
•  Cognitive dysfunction  
•  Dementia/Mild Cognitive Impairment 
There were very few patients with a medical history of cognitive dysfunction and dementia. Therefore, 
these  patients  were  included  as  a  single  group.  However,  this  combined  group  included  very  low 
numbers; consequently, no trends for the TEAEs of special interest could be observed. 
In  patients  with  a  pre-existing  history  of  hypertension  a  lower  incidence  of  hypoxia/respiratory 
depression,  hypotension  and  bradycardia  was  observed  in  those  who  received  remimazolam  in 
comparison  to  patients  who  received  propofol.  In  patients  with  a  pre-existing  history  of  cardiac 
dysfunction  the  incidence  of  these  TEAEs  of  special  interest  was  similar  between  the  two  treatment 
groups. However, similar to previous subgroups, the incidence of agitation and delirium was higher in 
the  remimazolam  group  in  comparison  to  the  propofol  group  for  patients  with  a  pre-existing  medical 
history of hypertension or cardiac dysfunction.  
Cognitively impaired patients requiring hospitalisation and surgical interventions are at an increased risk 
of adverse outcomes, including an increased risk of delirium and of (temporary) post-operative cognitive 
decline.  Current  guidelines  on  anaesthesia  in  cognitively  impaired  patients  conclude  there  is  no 
convincing evidence that the risk of decline of cognitive function in cognitively impaired patients is tied 
only to anaesthesia itself, or to a particular intravenous anaesthetic drug. The guidelines do suggest that 
the  totality  of  peri-operative  management,  including  adequate  pain  management,  optimisation  of  all 
other aspects of peri-operative care, avoidance of unnecessary post-operative sedation, and attention 
to medication interactions in patients more likely to have polypharmacy, and to the psychological needs 
to  cognitively  impaired  subjects,  all  contribute  to  better  outcomes.  Recent  literature  reviews  come  to 
similar  conclusions  that  there  is  no  strong  evidence  linking  the  particular  type  of  anaesthesia  (local-
regional,  inhalation  or  total  intravenous)  itself  to  cognitive  decline,  but  that  post-operative  cognitive 
decline is seen more frequently after coronary bypass surgery and is also more likely in elderly patients.  
Belrose and Noppens in their 2019 paper concluded: “Alzheimer’s Disease or similar underlying pathology 
may make individuals more susceptible to the potential neurotoxic effects of the surgical stress and/or 
anaesthesia exposure and increase the risk of progression of cognitive impairment. Several mechanisms 
have been implicated including altered Amyloid-β processing or accumulation, pathological modifications 
to tau, neuroinflammation, calcium dysregulation, and mitochondrial dysfunction”. They quote from the 
guidance/recommendations  developed  by  the  fifth  international  perioperative  neurotoxicity  working 
group, which included over 30 experts who developed recommendations specific to postoperative brain 
health in individuals > 65 years of age: “Current literature is insufficient to define a specific anaesthetic 
regimen to decrease risk of perioperative neurocognitive disorder; however, cautious use or avoidance 
of  medications  such  as 
first-generation  antihistamines,  centrally  acting  anticholinergics, 
benzodiazepines,  and  meperidine  is  recommended.  The  authors  also  suggest  avoiding  relative 
hypotension, maintenance of normothermia, use age-adjusted minimal alveolar concentration of volatile 
Assessment report

anaesthetic agents, and use EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitoring to titrate anaesthetic delivery”. 
Benzodiazepines here should be read as longer acting benzodiazepines as those are more likely to impact 
memory.  
Cottrell  and  Hartung  in  their  2022  paper  indicated:  “Unless  and  until  it  would  be  possible  to  classify 
anaesthetic neurotoxicity as a rare complication, the first-do-no-harm approach should be to: (1) add 
anaesthesia to surgical intervention on the physiological cost side of the cost/benefit ratio when making 
decisions about whether and when to proceed with surgery; (2) minimize anaesthetic depth and periods 
of  electroencephalographic  suppression;  (3)  limit  the  duration  of  continuous  anaesthesia  whenever 
possible; (4) consider the possibility that regional anesthesia with deep sedation may be as neurotoxic 
as general anaesthesia; and (5) when feasible, use regional anaesthesia with light or no sedation“. 
Based on the similar duration of action of propofol and remimazolam a significant difference in outcomes 
of anaesthesia in cognitively impaired patients is not anticipated. There is currently no scientific evidence 
which suggests otherwise.  
In view of the high interest of anesthesiologists in optimising treatment of cognitively impaired patients 
and  the  ageing  population,  it  is  likely  that  cases  with  unexpected  cognitive  decline  after  general 
anaesthesia in patients with or without pre-existing cognitive impairment will be reported as single cases. 
It is also likely that there will be publications looking at outcomes in patients with cognitive impairment 
undergoing  anaesthesia  with  remimazolam,  and  all  publications  related  to  remimazolam  will  be 
monitored by the MAH on a weekly basis. Either source of information presenting evidence not in line 
with  the  current  expectation,  that  remimazolam  anaesthesia  is  unlikely  to  have  significant  impact  on 
cognitive impairment, would be picked up by the MAH’s signaling processes.  
As  detailed  below,  the  MAH  provided  a  thorough  justification  for  not  including  the  cognitively  frail 
population  as  an  important  safety  concern  in  the  RMP,  mostly  based  on  the  present  special  cautions 
which are taken a priori with this special population.  
It  is  well  recognized  that  patients  with  dementia  or  cognitive  impairment  who  may  have  functioned 
reasonably  well  in  their  home  environment,  may  decompensate  when  suddenly  moved  to  a  different 
location  or  setting  as  occurs  with  planned  or  acute  hospitalization.  Such  decompensation  is  not 
dependent  on  the  department  to  which  a  patient  is  admitted.  Medical  factors  such  as  trauma  /  pain, 
illness, circulatory instability, hypoxia, electrolyte disturbances, polypharmacy, and sleep deprivation will 
increase risks of such decompensation and associated risks of e.g., wandering about while unsteady or 
disoriented, falls, and need for sedation or restraining. 
The  risk  of  decompensation  is  considered  already  in  the  decision  to  admit  patients  with  dementia  or 
cognitive impairment. These patients are generally not admitted for procedures which would not improve 
or maintain their quality of life, or for mild illness. As clearly indicated in guidelines, besides considering 
medico-legal issues with respect to decision making ability of such patients, the surgery in these patients 
normally will only occur if the reasons for the procedure and the expected improvement of retention of 
quality of life outweigh the risks of decompensation and associated problematic behaviours. 
Patients do not fall during anaesthesia or in the recovery room or intensive care unit (ICU) where those 
will not ordinarily be mobile, and patients with known dementia will normally be closely watched, and 
where  fixation  of  infusion  lines  or  sensors  will  already  occur  with  more  care  to  avoid  decompensated 
patients removing them too easily. Unless the patient’s vital signs are unstable, in that closely monitored 
setting removal of infusion lines or sensors is not very probable or of particular risk to the patient. Risk 
of inappropriately getting out of bed and falling in hospital is also reduced by having high sides of the 
bed up in such patients. 
After surgery, a patient with known dementia or cognitive impairment will normally only return to a ward 
(or  be  discharged  to  the  home  address  if  sufficient  care  can  be  provided  there)  if  considered  (and 
Assessment report  
EMA/79576/2023  
Page 113/129 
 
 
 
expected  to  remain)  stable.  At  that  time,  any  remaining  infusion  lines  would  likely  only  be  there  if 
required  to  maintain  fluid  balance  or  administer  medications  and  sensor  lines  will  generally  not  be 
present. As in the recovery room and ICU there either would be additional attention to fixation of any 
lines or, if possible, IV access would be reduced to just a well fixated needle which a patient is less likely 
to remove. Temporary loss if such lines or IV access is not a significant risk in a stable patient. 
Post-surgery pain may well require strong analgesics and both pain and analgesics, in particular opioids, 
will increase the risk of decompensation well past the recovery of anaesthesia period. In addition, pain, 
unusual noises, illness, constipation, urinary retention, and other factors may contribute to the risk of 
decompensation. In the general ward decompensation can increase the risk of wandering and falling. 
Independent  of  whether  decompensation  occurs  in  a  post-surgery  patient  with  dementia  or  cognitive 
impairment or such a patient in another hospital ward, if unwanted behaviour cannot be managed by 
additional attention for such a patient, including e.g., allowing family members to remain with the patient 
longer  than  just  visiting  hours,  then  the  hospital  staff  will  have  to  weigh  the  risks  of  not  sedating  or 
restraining  the  patient  (wandering,  falling,  removal  if  lines  or  remaining  sensors)  with  the  very  well 
recognized  risks  of  sedation  or  restraining  (further  decompensation,  prolonged  hospitalisation,  airway 
infections,  decubitus,  etc).  Such  considerations  will  generally  also  include  the  possibility  of  early 
discharge as another way to bring such patients back into their normal environment as this may be the 
quickest route to recovery of the patient’s behaviour to prehospitalisation status. 
The  focus  of  the  anaesthesia  guidelines  quoted  by  the  MAH  is  not  only  on  the  long-term  cognitive 
outcome,  as  suggested  by  the  assessor,  but  also  on  minimizing  the  impact  of  anaesthesia  and  other 
required  interventions  on  the  short  term  risks  to  the  patient  with  dementia  or  cognitive  impairment. 
Such risks include mental decompensation and the associated risks thereof. In as far as anaesthesia may 
be a contributing factor, it should be as short as possible, not deeper than needed, using short acting 
anaesthetics and avoiding longer acting sedatives, and avoiding or reducing opioid analgesics as much 
as  possible.  All  other  treatable  risk  factors  should  be  optimally  treated,  as  also  indicated  in  the 
anaesthetist’s guideline. 
A recent publication detailing results of a cohort study in anaesthesia with remimazolam in 78 compared 
to 122 patients with other anaesthesia showed no significant difference in rate of delirium. Based on the 
PAION  clinical  trials  and  such  recent  publications  of  independent  investigators,  there  is  no  reason  to 
expect that anaesthesia with remimazolam would be such a significant risk factor for decompensation of 
patients  with  dementia  or  cognitive  impairment  that  this  could  be  recognized  above  the  multitude  of 
background risk factors such patients encounter due to change of environment, illness, pain, and sleep 
deprivation. 
Although remimazolam is a benzodiazepine, due to its shorter duration of action its risk is likely to be 
lower than those of i.e. midazolam, closer to those of propofol, as evidenced by available trial and post-
marketing data. 
Ultimately, although agreed not to include the cognitively frail population as an important safety concern 
in  the  RMP  (mostly  based  on  the  present  special  cautions  which  are  taken  a  priori  with  this  special 
population), considering that frequency and magnitude of the effect of remimazolam related events are 
not known in the real world, the CHMP is of the view that “Use in cognitively impaired patients” should 
be  included  in  the  PSUR  list  of  safety  concerns  and  followed  up  closely,  with  special  attention  to  the 
frequency  of  all  relevant  events  in  the  cognitively  impaired  population,  as  compared  to  the  general 
population. Relevant events should include not only CNS events, such as disorientation and agitation, 
but also risk of falls, self-removal of IV lines, monitorization devices or the need to restrain or sedate.

Extrinsic Factors 
Owing to the intended use of remimazolam as an IV agent, no analyses were conducted evaluating the 
effects of extrinsic factors such as food or alcohol on the safety profile of IV remimazolam.  
An important extrinsic factor which could have an impact on the incidence of TEAEs is the type of surgery 
performed. 
It was noted that, in general, the incidence of TEAEs with respect to type of surgery was similar across 
the total remimazolam and propofol groups. A lower incidence of hypotension was seen in patients who 
underwent orthopaedic or urological surgery within the total remimazolam group. Due to its beneficial 
effects on haemodynamic stability, a lower incidence of hypotension within remimazolam groups is to be 
expected. 
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
One  subject  in  clinical  trial  CNS7056-005  became  pregnant,  with  date  of  conception  one  or  two  days 
after  remimazolam  administration.  A  healthy  male  baby  was  delivered  at  term,  and  the  child  was 
developing normally at 3.5 months, when follow-up information was received.  
Drug Abuse Potential 
Drug abuse potential was examined as part of the procedural sedation summary of clinical safety. Here 
it was demonstrated there was no drug abuse potential associated with remimazolam. As the route of 
administration for the proposed indication is also IV this matter was not further explored.  
2.6.8.7  Immunological events  
Immunological events were not explored during the Phase 3 pivotal trials. 
2.6.8.8  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug Interactions 
The sedative effect of remimazolam can be accentuated by any concomitantly administered medication 
that depresses the CNS, such as sedative-hypnotics and narcotics, (e.g., other benzodiazepines, [fos-
]propofol, volatile anaesthetics and opioid agonists).  
Risks from Concomitant Use With Opioids 
TEAEs of special interest in the controlled clinical trials in general anaesthesia (group B) were analysed 
according  to  the  amount  of  concomitant  remifentanil,  co-administered  in  all  clinical  trials  with 
remimazolam.  For  this  purpose,  the  cumulative,  time-normalised  remifentanil  infusion  dose  was 
calculated for each patient, and TEAEs are presented according to dose categories by quartiles.  
Hypoxia  increased  with  cumulative  remifentanil  dose  in  the  propofol  treatment  group  but  not  with 
remimazolam. The incidence of hypotension was not different in the remifentanil dose categories, but 
bradycardia seemed to be more frequent in the lowest remifentanil dose group. Similarly, agitation and 
delirium appeared to be more frequent in the lowest remifentanil dose group. 
Pharmacokinetic Drug Interactions 
Remimazolam is metabolized via ester cleavage by carboxylesterase-1A, predominantly expressed in the 
liver. Because it is not a CYP substrate, exposure is not expected to be affected by drugs that induce or 
inhibit CYP enzymes. Remimazolam and its primary metabolite, CNS7054, do not induce or inhibit any 
tested CYP enzymes, and they are not substrates of - nor do they cause any relevant inhibition of - the 
tested human drug transporters. Thus, there is a low potential for PK drug interactions.

Clinical Drug Interactions 
Clinical safety data were examined for any evidence of an interaction between remimazolam and other 
drugs; concomitant antihypertensive drugs, sedative or hypnotic drugs and concomitant or prior chronic 
use  of  opiates  and/or  benzodiazepines.  The  primary  analyses  were  based  on  the  controlled  trials  in 
general  anaesthesia  (Group B)  and  focused  on  the  SMQs  and  CMQs  identified  as  pertinent  for  this 
indication. The following potential interactions were noted: 
•  Subjects  receiving  CES1  inhibitors  exhibited  a  higher  number  of  TEAEs  in  S/CMQs 
hypoxia/respiratory  depression,  hypotension,  bradycardia  and  agitation/delirium  in  the  total 
remimazolam and the total propofol treatment groups; 
•  Subjects  receiving  anti-histamines  exhibited  a  higher  number  of  TEAEs  in  S/CMQs 
hypoxia/respiratory depression and bradycardia. The increase in respiratory depression TEAEs 
was more pronounced in the total propofol group in comparison to the total remimazolam group, 
while the opposite trend was seen for bradycardia; 
•  Subjects receiving anti-cholinergics showed an increased incidence for hypoxia, bradycardia and 
agitation/delirium  and  a  decreased  incidence  of  hypotension.  These  differences  were  similar 
across treatment groups. 
•  Subjects  receiving  concomitant  antihypertensive  medications  appeared  to  have  a  higher 
incidence of hypoxia, hypotension, bradycardia and agitation in both treatment groups; 
•  Subjects  receiving  drugs  acting  on  the  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  system  (RAAS)  had 
increased incidences of bradycardia and agitation with no differences between treatment arms; 
•  Subjects receiving anti-arrhythmic drugs had increased incidences of hypoxia, bradycardia and 
agitation and a decreased incidence of hypotension with no differences between treatment arms; 
•  Subjects receiving anti-epileptic or anti-depressant drugs had increased incidences of hypoxia 
with no differences between treatment arms. 
The  analyses  did  not  point  to  a  special  risk  posed  by  one  of  the  co-medications  when  used  with 
remimazolam. While incidences for some of the examined S/CMQs increased by the use of comedications 
this increase was similar in the propofol treatment arm. The increased incidences are likely to represent 
the impact of the underlying disease and/or differences in the demographics between users and non-
users (e.g. antihypertensives probably more frequently used by elderly).  
These  risks  can  be  minimized  by  dose  individualization  and  titration  to  desired  clinical  response.  It  is 
noted that the low numbers of subjects in some subgroups precluded assessment of some interactions. 
The analysis of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in all subjects of propofol-controlled trials 
did not indicate an influence of remifentanil. Based on other evidence, however, a warning for the co-
administration with opioids is mentioned in different sections of the SmPC (i.e. section 4.2, 4.4, 4.5). 
An  analysis  of  TEAEs  for  other  potential  drug-drug  interaction  was  performed  and  some  potential 
interactions identified. However, it is difficult to assess whether those are true interactions or whether 
certain  adverse  events  are  increased  with  a  concomitant  drug  because  of  the  underlying  medical 
condition this concomitant drug treats, the specific adverse effect profile of the concomitant drug or a 
demographic effect whereby the subjects receiving a certain concomitant drug are on average older or 
of a worse overall physical condition. Moreover, for some of the concomitant drug classes and analysed 
TEAEs the numbers are too small to draw conclusions. In addition, the observation that similar trends 
are observed for propofol, and none of those interactions are mentioned in propofol’s SmPC, indicates 
that  anaesthesiologists  are  aware  of  increased  sensitivities  e.g.  for  patients  with  a  cardiovascular 
Assessment report

background  history  to  be  at  a  higher  risk  for  hemodynamic  adverse  events  such  as  hypotension  or 
bradycardia.  
Subjects  receiving  CES1  inhibitors  exhibited  a  higher  number  of  TEAEs  in  Standardised/Customised 
MedDRA  Queries 
(S/CMQs)  hypoxia/respiratory  depression,  hypotension,  bradycardia  and 
agitation/delirium in the total remimazolam and the total propofol treatment groups. CES inhibitors can 
theoretically interact with remimazolam on a pharmacokinetic basis but not with propofol. Since there is 
a  similar  trend  for  both  drugs,  a  PK  interaction  can  be  excluded.  CES  inhibitors  come  from  different 
pharmacological  classes,  hence  a  pharmacodynamic  interaction  with  remimazolam  and  propofol  is 
unlikely. Therefore, the MAH concluded that the increased incidence of some TEAEs in the presence of 
CES1 inhibitors is due to the medical condition for which those are used rather than a direct interaction 
with remimazolam.   
Subjects  receiving  inhibitors  of  the  renin-angiotensin-system  (RAS  inhibitors)  or  anti-hypertensives 
showed higher incidences of hypotension and bradycardia. The MAH is of the opinion that the background 
disease  (i.e.  hypertension)  predisposes  to  hemodynamic  adverse  events  such  as  hypotension 
(particularly when assessed as change from baseline) and bradycardia. This is agreed upon by the CHMP. 
Anticholinergic drugs in general, and antimuscarinics in particular, can cause confusion and are used for 
the treatment of drug-induced dyskinesias. Hence, it is conceivable that adverse events from the CMQ 
agitation that encompasses preferred terms such as cognitive disorder, confusional state, or delirium are 
increased when anti-cholinergic drugs are used. 
The analysis of DDIs in the submitted dossier is based on pool B of clinical trials in general anaesthesia 
i.e. all propofol-controlled trials. Pool B in comparison to pool A (the pivotal trials) has data from two 
small trials involving patients undergoing cardiac anaesthesia (studies CNS7056-010 and CNS7056-011). 
The patient’s characteristics (e.g. medical history and concomitant medications), as well as the adverse 
event profiles (e.g. incidence of agitation/delirium), were different than in the pivotal trials. In order to 
assess the impact of these trials on the DDI analyses, the analyses were repeated for pool A. 
The most striking difference is for the adverse event of special interest ‘agitation’. Overall (as outlined 
in  the  Table  59)  the  incidences  are  considerable  lower  and,  particularly  for  remimazolam,  in  pool A 
(pivotal trials) there is no apparent increase in the incidence of agitation with concomitant drugs. This is 
in contrast to the analysis of pool B where there was a bias of cardiac patients with a high incidence of 
agitation, and a higher likelihood for receiving concomitant medications, particularly for the treatment 
of cardiovascular diseases.

The MAH concluded there is no evidence for the adverse event of agitation (included in SmPC section 
4.8 with frequency common) to increase with a particular co-medication.  
A warning for enhanced sedation and cardiorespiratory depression when remimazolam is used together 
with  centrally  depressing  drugs,  including  anti-histamines  and  anti-hypertensives,  was  included  in 
section 4.5 of the SmPC.  
An analysis of TEAEs for other potential DDI was performed and some potential interactions identified. 
In the opinion of the MAH no further warning is warranted since other potential interactions evaluated 
are  rather  due  to  the  underlying  medical  condition,  the  specific  adverse  events  caused  by  the 
concomitant  drugs,  or  demographic  differences.  Furthermore,  for  all  potential  interactions  there  is  a 
similar  effect  seen  with  propofol,  and  none  of  those  interactions  are  mentioned  in  propofol’s  SmPC, 
indicating that anaesthesiologists are aware that such increased sensitivities can exist. Nevertheless, the 
option  to  conduct  further  analyses  was  considered,  as  requested  by  the  CHMP.  The  MAH  satisfactory 
justified why further analyses would not yield any meaningful results, especially not sufficiently robust 
enough as to allow for conclusions to be presented in the SmPC: 
•  Some subgroups have a very low number of subjects; 
• 
It is impossible to assess as to whether a specific effect is due to the co-medication itself or the 
underlying medical condition; 
•  The  average  age  and/or  physical  condition  (e.g.  ASA  class)  is  likely  to  be  higher  in  patients 
receiving certain co-medications, thereby skewing the results; 
•  Some  of  the  drug  classes  have  drugs  with  rather  different  pharmacological  modes  of  action, 
hence a pharmacodynamic interaction is difficult to hypothesize; 
•  The  proposed  analyses  would  result  in  >20  individual  statistical  tests.  The  likelihood  of  false 
positive  results  is  high  with  this  number  of  individual  test  further  precluding  any  meaningful 
conclusion. 
The CHMP, having considered the above, concluded that no further warning is warranted with regards 
to other potential DDI. The existing analyses point to very similar potential interactions with propofol, 
and none of those interactions are mentioned in propofol SmPC, indicating that anaesthesiologists are 
aware that such increased sensitivities can exist and will be able to anticipate patients at risk. It is also 
considered that section 4.4 of the SmPC is updated with regards to chronic use of CNS depressant drugs. 
2.6.8.9  Post marketing experience 
Remimazolam has been approved for procedural sedation in adults in Europe (EEA and UK), USA and 
China; for GA in adults in Japan, and for both indications in Korea. The International Birth Date (IBD) is 
23 January 2020 (Japan). It has been marketed in Europe (Netherland and UK), USA, China, Japan and 
Korea.

The data lock point (DLP) for post-marketing data included in this line extension application is the DLP 
of the Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Report (PBRER) covering the period 22 January 2021 - 22 July 
2021 (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010924/202107). 
For procedural sedation exposure data were calculated based on the estimated use of 1 vial of 20 mg by 
patient in the USA, while the number of patients exposed in China was provided by the licensing partner. 
Up to the DLP of 22 July 2021, there have been no sales in Europe. For GA, the calculation was based 
on the estimated use of 4 vials of 50 mg by patient for Japan and Korea. 
The  estimated  cumulative  post-authorisation  sales  volumes,  until  22  July  2021,  was  13,484,500 mg 
(165,240 vials of 50 mg and 261,125 vials of 20 mg), and the estimated cumulative post-authorisation 
exposure was 302,435 patients; 261,125 patients in procedural sedation (mainly from China) and 41,310 
patients in general anaesthesia (mainly from Japan).  
The safety signals that were ongoing during the reporting interval of PBRER number 03 (covering the 
period  23  January  2021  –  22  July  2021)  were:  blood  in  urine,  prolonged  sedation,  delirium  and 
anaphylaxis (not clear whether linked to remimazolam or rather to the excipient dextran 40). 
In addition, a vascular access site occlusion was evaluated. Eleven cases of vascular access site occlusion 
were  reported,  linked  to  the  use  of  solvents  not  compatible  with  remimazolam.  The  information  is 
included 
in 
SmPC 
section 
4.5.  Within 
the 
PSUSA 
for 
PBRER 
number 
03 
(EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010924/202107), concluded in February 2022, PRAC, having considered available 
data (i.e. from Eudravigilance, literature), agreed for “anaphylactic reaction” to be added to Byfavo 20 
mg SmPC, in the tabulated list of ADRs from post-marketing experience, and “sudden, severe allergic 
reaction”, (frequency: unknown) to be added to the side effects section of the PIL for Byfavo 20 mg. 
Furthermore,  as  completed  by  the  time  of  writing  this  AR,  within  the 
following  PSUSA 
(EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010924/202201),  concluded  in  July  2022,  given  data  from  literature  and 
spontaneous reports, PRAC recommended to strengthen Byfavo 20 mg PI to ensure HCPs are adequately 
informed about the potential risk of vascular access site occlusion when remimazolam is administered 
with  incompatible  fluids  (which  may  result  in  precipitation/turbidity,  which  may  cause  occlusion  of 
vascular access site) via an update of SmPC section 6.2 (and PIL, accordingly). 
The above has also been reflected in the PI for Byfavo 50 mg. 
2.6.9  Conclusion on clinical safety 
There  are  differences  between  remimazolam  and  propofol  pooled  groups.  A  higher  proportion  of 
overweight and obese participants were included in propofol group (40% and 16% vs 34% and 14% in 
remimazolam group). Higher proportion of participants with ASA III/IV were enrolled in propofol group 
(61% vs 50% in remimazolam group). Higher proportion of participants with moderate renal impairment 
were enrolled in propofol group (34% vs 26% in remimazolam group). Higher proportions of patients 
with cardiac disorder and hypertension were included in propofol group (45% and 62% vs 37% and 54% 
in  remimazolam  group).  These  differences  in  the  baseline  characteristics  of  the  safety  population 
triggered few uncertainties in the interpretation of safety data (i.e. when attempting to make a complete 
comparison  of  remimazolam  and  propofol  safety  profiles),  without  a  major  impact  on  the  safety 
conclusions.  
The safety database (including 783 patients) is not large enough to capture rare adverse events. Despite 
this limitation, the safety profiles of remimazolam and propofol are broadly comparable. Observed TEAEs 
indicate  remimazolam  potential  for  haemodynamic  disturbances,  gastrointestinal  disorders,  pyrexia, 
chills,  wound  complications,  postoperative  anaemia,  postoperative  delirium  and  agitation,

setting.

2.9  Product information 
2.9.1  User consultation 
Conclusion from the checklist for the review of user consultation 
The PL for Byvafo 20 mg Powder for solution for injection/ infusion was successfully tested during the 
MAA procedure in 2019/2020. Changes in the PL for Byfavo 50 mg Powder for concentrate for solution 
for injection/ infusion, are introduced in sections 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6.Overall the methodology is considered 
satisfactory  and  the  results  meet  the  success  criteria  for  all  questions  posed,  as  set  out  in  the  EC 
Guideline on Readability of Label and Package Leaflet of Medicinal Products for Human Use.  
The focus test has successfully demonstrated the comprehensibility and usability of the PL. 
2.9.2  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Byfavo (remimazolam) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1  Disease or condition 
Remimazolam completed clinical development in the indication for induction and maintenance of general 
anesthesia  (GA)  and  had  received  marketing  approval  for  this  indication  in  January  2020  in  Japan 
(ANEREM®) and in January 2021 in South Korea. The clinical program for this latter indication was also 
completed in Europe. For the induction of anaesthesia a dose of 6mg/min (used in the EU phase III trial) 
is  given  until  loss  of  consciousness  and  maintenance  is  achieved  by  continuous  infusion  of  1 mg/min 
(which  could  be  titrated  down  to  0.1mg/min  and  up  to  a  maximum  of  2.5mg/min).  In  the  propofol-
controlled  trials  for  remimazolam  in  GA  i.e.  ONO-2745-05,  CNS7056-010,  CNS7056-011  and 
CNS7056-022 the mean cumulative dose administered was 275 mg (3.8 mg/kg). The mean duration of 
exposure was 218min (range: 32-683 min). 
3.1.2  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Although there are several alternatives for total infusion anaesthesiology, such as gases, infusion 
induced and maintained general anaesthesia is limited to propofol and midazolam.  
Risks associated with the inhalation anaesthetics include malignant hyperthermia, long QT syndrome, 
severe post-operative nausea and vomiting, potential cerebral oedema, and myasthenia gravis. 
Propofol based TIVA is associated with the possible risks of injection site pain, anaphylactic reactions to 
the soy components in the lipid emulsion, and severe hypotension combined with a bradycardia effect. 
Other benzodiazepines, in particular midazolam, have also been used for TIVA but have become less 
popular, due to their longer duration of action resulting in delayed recovery, and possibly higher risk of 
post-operative delirium.

3.1.3  Main clinical studies 
The efficacy of remimazolam for induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia (GA) was evaluated 
in a total of six clinical trials.  
CNS7056-022 and ONO-2745-05 were the two pivotal studies, the former conducted in Europe, the latter 
in Japan.

3.2  Favourable effects 
The  main  efficacy  data  for  this  line  extension  application  have  come  from  the  European  pivotal  trial 
(study CNS7056-022) where remimazolam was non-inferior to propofol in the percentage of time with 
narcotrend  Index  ≤60  during  the  maintenance  phase  (RMZ:  94.6%  of  patients  and  PPF  98.9%  of 
patients). Loss of consciousness was achieved and maintained in nearly all patients receiving RMZ during 
surgical procedures. Thus, GA was achieved (efficacy: nearly 100%). Based on the mechanism of action 
and  the  fact  that  the  medicine  was  titrated  to  effect,  this  was  expected.  With  regards  to  secondary 
endpoints (NCI between 27 and 60, NCI < 27, Need for rescue sedation), results were also non-inferior 
to propofol. RMZ was also superior to PPF regarding critical hypotensive events per patient (RMZ 56% 
versus PPF (64%) at the interim analysis. Time to onset of action appears to be shorter in RMZ compared 
to PPF. 
In the Japanese pivotal trial, Study ONO-2745-05, the (different) primary efficacy endpoint was 
functional capability as a general anaesthetic, and was achieved by all participants (100%) in each of 
the treatment arms. 
The availability of flumazenil is favourable for remimazolam. 
3.3  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Study CNS 7056-022 (the European pivotal trial) planned to randomly enrol 542 patients. However, due 
to COVID-19 pandemic, this study was terminated before the planned sample size could be reached. At 
the time of study termination, 365 patients had been randomised (about 67% of the planned sample 
size). Furthermore, in this trial the statistical analysis of the ‘key secondary outcome’ (i.e. haemodynamic 
stability),  designed  to  test  superiority  of  remimazolam  over  propofol,  was  changed  post  hoc  and  the 
modifications  introduced  hampered  the  conclusion.  Therefore,  no  superiority  of  remimazolam  over 
propofol on the account of haemodynamic stability can be claimed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/79576/2023  
Page 123/129 
 
 
 
 
In addition, several secondary efficacy endpoints pointed towards a different direction from the primary 
endpoint. However, the below was considered: 
•  Onset of effect - the time to event secondary efficacy endpoints indicated a slightly quicker onset of 
action in remimazolam compared to propofol, although these results were difficult to interpret in the 
light of a higher percentage of patients with too deep anaesthesia in remimazolam arm.  
•  Offset of effect - the secondary efficacy outcomes of time from the stop of the IMP to extubation 
were similar in both treatment arms. However, a difference was observed in time from stop of IMP 
to response to verbal command (15 min in remimazolam compared to 12 min in propofol). An even 
larger difference disfavouring remimazolam is observed in time from stop of IMP to orientation (54 
minutes  in  remimazolam  compared  to  30  minutes  in  propofol).  The  almost  doubling  of  time  to 
orientation in time, place, person and situation observed with remimazolam was noted as clinically 
relevant and unlikely to be solely the consequence of lack of experience with the product. Similarly, 
time  to  modified  Aldrete  Score  ≥9  was  53  minutes  in  remimazolam  compared  to  37  minutes  in 
propofol groups with almost no overlapping in CIs (95% CI 44-58 mins for remimazolam and 28-45 
mins for propofol). Since the modified Aldrete score is used to evaluate patients in post anaesthesia 
care, with the purpose to check whether they can be safely discharged, this information is considered 
to  be  of  importance  for  healthcare  practitioners,  thus  outlined  in  the  SmPC.  These  characteristics 
demand more time from the anaesthesiologist team to attend the patient after surgery. 
•  Explicit  awareness  (incidence  of  the  occurrence  of  intra-operative  awakening)  was  not  evident  in 
either treatment groups during the procedures. However, unspecific, potential signs of intraoperative 
awakening  were  reported  with  a  notably  higher  occurrence  in  remimazolam  arm  compared  to 
propofol (18.5% vs 7.4%). This could partially be explained by the unfamiliarity of investigators with 
remimazolam resulting in closer observation of patients.  
• 
The percentage of time with NCI ≤60 and ≥27 during the maintenance (first skin incision to last skin 
suture) was higher in the PPF arm than in the RMZ (78% vs 68%) arm based on the FAS. This was 
due to a higher proportion of patients with both NCI< 27 and NCI>60, which may be related to a 
higher difficulty in adequately refine the level of anaesthesia. 
Study  ONO-2745–05,  which  was  conducted  almost  a  decade  ago  in  Japan,  did  not  formally  evaluate 
haemodynamic stability results. 
3.4  Unfavourable effects 
In  controlled  clinical  trials,  88.8%  of  patients  experienced  any  TEAE  in  the  remimazolam  group  in 
comparison with 92.5% in propofol group.  
The  incidence  of  (mild,  moderate  or  severe)  TEAEs  was  largely  similar  across  the  total  propofol  and 
remimazolam groups.  
The most common TEAEs in the total remimazolam group (>5%) by PT were: hypotension (25.0% vs 
34.1%  in  propofol  group),  blood  pressure  decreased  (20.1%  vs  25.5%),  nausea  (14.2%  vs  11.5%), 
bradycardia (10.1% vs 17.3%), vomiting (9.7% vs 5.8%), pleural effusion (9.7% vs 11.1%), procedural 
nausea  (7.9%  vs  8.8%),  wound  complications  (6.9%  vs  4.9%),  hypertension  (6.4%  vs  6.6%), 
procedural vomiting (5.5% vs 5.3%), pyrexia (5.5% vs 4.4%), chills (5.5% vs 4.9%), and postoperative 
anaemia (5.4% vs 6.6%). Overall, the incidence of serious TEAEs was slightly higher in the total propofol 
group in comparison to the total remimazolam group.  
The SOC with the highest incidence of serious TEAEs in both the total remimazolam and propofol group, 
was injury, poisoning and procedural complications which occurred in 2.7% of patients in both groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/79576/2023  
Page 124/129 
 
 
 
Within this SOC, the PT with the highest incidence in both treatment groups was postoperative delirium, 
occurring in 1.0% of all total remimazolam patients and 1.3% of total propofol patients.  
Five  TEAEs  (0.7%)  led  to  study  drug  discontinuation  in  comparison  with  one  (0.4%)  in  the  propofol 
group. These TEAEs in the total remimazolam group were post procedural haemorrhage, vascular access 
site  occlusion,  cough,  haemothorax  and  hypotension  and,  in  the  total  propofol  group,  the  TEAE  was 
hypotension. There were no TEAEs with an outcome of death. 
Incidences  of  AESI  by  SMQ/CMQs  in  controlled  clinical  trials  were:  hypoxia  (11.2%  vs  18.6%), 
hypotension  (51.3%  vs  66.4%),  bradycardia  (14.3%  vs  22.1%),  hypersensitivity  (2.5%  vs  1.8%), 
agitation  and  delirium  (10.1%  vs  7.5%),  injection  site  reaction  (0.7%  vs  4.9%)  in  remimazolam  and 
propofol groups, respectively. 
In the controlled trials incidences of SAEs were 8.6% vs 11.1% in remimazolam and propofol groups, 
respectively.  
Postoperative  delirium  is  the  only  SAE  PT  with  an  incidence  ≥1%  in  either  remimazolam  or  propofol 
group. 
An overall review of the TEAE’s, was performed and did no determine evidence of a differential response 
to treatment in the drug-demographic interaction subgroups; age, sex, race, ASA-PS classification and 
weight/BMI.  
The list of safety concerns in the risk management plan, in comparison to the initial MAA, is unchanged. 
Further details of the adverse event profile are contained in the section on clinical safety. 
3.5  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The lack of effect or extended duration of effect of RMZ as compared to PPF might have – to some extent 
– been related to the low number of patients studied, which may have not been sufficient to adequately 
discriminate among the treatment arms. The safety database (including 783 patients) is not large enough 
to capture rare adverse events.  
Participants with severe hepatic impairment were excluded from the clinical studies in the GA and the 
same holds true for patients with patent cognitive deficits. 
Differences were noted in the baseline characteristics of the safety population, between remimazolam 
and propofol pooled groups. A higher proportion of overweight and obese participants were included in 
propofol  group  (40%  and  16%  vs  34%  and  14%  in  remimazolam  group).  Higher  proportion  of 
participants  with  ASA  III/IV  were  enrolled  in  propofol  group  (61%  vs  50%  in  remimazolam  group). 
Higher proportion of participants with moderate renal impairment were enrolled in propofol group (34% 
vs 26% in remimazolam group). Higher proportions of patients with cardiac disorder and hypertension 
were  included  in  propofol  group  (45%  and  62%  vs  37%  and  54%  in  remimazolam  group).  These 
differences triggered few uncertainties in the interpretation of safety data (i.e. when attempting to make 
a  complete  comparison  of  remimazolam  and  propofol  safety  profiles),  without  a  major  impact  on  the 
safety conclusions. 
Although  safety  in  the  cognitively  frail  population  is  not  included  in  the  RMP  as  missing  information 
(mostly based on the present special cautions which are taken a priori with this population), considering 
that frequency and magnitude of the effect of remimazolam related events  are not known in the real 
world, “Use in cognitively impaired patients” should be included in the PSUR list of safety concerns and 
followed up closely.

From 
the  post-marketing  experienced  with  Byfavo  20  mg, 
it 
is  not  clear  whether 
anaphylactic/anaphylactoid shock or reaction could be linked to remimazolam or rather to the excipient

3.7  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1  Balance of benefits and risks 
The MAH provided sufficient evidence of remimazolam non-inferiority versus propofol.  
The  duration  of  action  of  propofol  is  slightly  shorter  than  that  of  remimazolam,  but  the  effect  of 
remimazolam  can  be  countered  almost  immediately  with  flumazenil,  while  it  is  not  possible  to 
immediately terminate the effects of propofol.  
Haemodynamic stability results were only formally evaluated in one study (European pivotal study) and 
the conclusions hampered by post-hoc modifications of the statistical analysis plan. Due to differences 
in baseline characteristics, no superiority of remimazolam over propofol on the account of haemodynamic 
stability can be claimed.  
The safety profiles of remimazolam and propofol seems broadly comparable. Observed TEAEs indicate 
RMZ  potential  for  haemodynamic  disturbances,  gastrointestinal  disorders,  pyrexia,  chills,  wound 
complications,  postoperative  anaemia,  postoperative  delirium  and  agitation,  hypersensitivity.  These 
observed AEs seem manageable given the general anaesthesia setting. 
3.8  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of remimazolam 50 mg for intravenous induction and maintenance of 
general anaesthesia in adults is positive, subject to the conditions detailed in section 4 of this AR.  
4  Recommendations 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus decision 
that the benefit-risk balance of, Byfavo 50 mg, powder for concentrate for solution for 
injection/infusion (powder for concentrate), is favourable in the following indication: 
• 
Intravenous induction and maintenance of general anesthesia (GA) in adults 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for Byfavo subject to

Summary of risk management plan for somatrogon 
This is a summary of the RMP for somatrogon.  The RMP details important risks of 
somatrogon, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about somatrogon’s risks.  
Somatrogon’s Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and its Package Leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how somatrogon should be 
used.  
This summary of the RMP for somatrogon should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
somatrogon’s RMP. 
I. The Medicine and What It Is Used For 
Somatrogon is indicated for the treatment of children and adolescents from 3 years of age 
with growth disturbance due to insufficient secretion of growth hormone.  It contains 
somatrogon as the active substance and it is given by subcutaneous injection once weekly. 
Injection: 24 mg/1.2 mL or 60 mg/1.2 mL available as: 
•  Single-patient-use, disposable pre-filled pen containing 24 mg/1.2 mL that delivers a 
dose in 0.2 mg increments. 
•  Single-patient-use, disposable pre-filled pen containing 60 mg/1.2 mL that delivers a 
dose in 0.5 mg increments. 
Further information about the evaluation of somatrogon’s benefits can be found in 
somatrogon’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, which when available, will be 
placed in the EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/ngenla 
II. Risks Associated With the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further 
Characterise the Risks 
Important risks of somatrogon, together with measures to minimise such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about somatrogon’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the potential risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use in the 
proposed PL and proposed SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
 
 
 
•  The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without a prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.  
In addition to these measures, information about AEs is collected continuously and regularly 
analysed so that immediate action can be taken as necessary.  These measures constitute 
routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
II.A List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of somatrogon are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered.  Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks are 
concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of somatrogon.  Potential 
risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on 
available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation.  
Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is 
currently missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

Patients with a previous neoplasm have an increased risk of 
relapse of the same tumour type without treatment due to the 
biology of the disease. 
In addition, regardless of underlying diagnosis, paediatric 
patients with prior neoplasm are at an increased risk of 
developing second neoplasm when treated with growth 
hormone especially if they had received prior radiotherapy.

Additional pharmacovigilance activities 
A large observational study of patients treated with GH in 
childhood concluded that the patients had an increased risk 
of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with the 
general population.  However, most patients had diabetes 
risk factors and certain patient populations receiving GH 
treatment are inherently at risk of developing type 2 diabetes 
mellitus.  Due to the low number of subjects exposed to 
somatrogon in the completed clinical trials, the strength of 
evidence for the risk of development of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus in somatrogon-treated subjects is limited. 
Hyperglycemia/new onset diabetes can be serious if not 
diagnosed and treated appropriately.  At-risk groups include 
a family history of diabetes mellitus, pre-existing diabetes, 
type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance, glucose 
intolerance, and obesity.

Patients who administer GH injections daily may continue to

patients who are not used to the somatrogon pen may self-
administer a lower dose than prescribed. 
Patients switching from daily to weekly dosing.

when a dose is missed, switching between daily GH to 
weekly therapy, and monitoring IGF-1 to support dose 
adjustments.

Additional pharmacovigilance activities 
Somatrogon has given rise to the formation of antibodies in 
approximately 77% of children and adolescent patients.  The 
binding activity of these antibodies has been low and no 
clinical consequences have been associated with their 
formation. 
There are currently no reliable predictors of patients who 
may or may not develop ADAs, as antibodies develop to 
varying degrees during treatment with human proteins 
including growth hormone.

PASS Summary 
Study short name and title:  
An Active Surveillance Study to Monitor the  Real-World Long-Term Safety of Somatrogon 
Among  Paediatric Patients in Europe. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Purpose of the study:  
The purpose of this study will be to  assess the long-term safety of somatrogon, a long-acting 
hGH, under routine clinical care and is  intended to reflect outcomes that occur in real-world 
clinical practice. 
Primary Objective:  
•  Estimate the incidence rates of neoplasms, and diabetes mellitus type 2, the primary 
safety events of interest, in paediatric patients treated with somatrogon, and paediatric 
patients treated with once daily somatropin, in the course of routine clinical care. 
Secondary Objectives: 
•  Estimate the incidence rates of clinical endpoints related to immunogenicity, 
medication errors, the secondary safety events of interest, in paediatric patients 
treated with somatrogon, and paediatric patients treated with once daily somatropin, 
in the course of routine clinical care. 
•  Evaluate long-term efficacy by measuring IGF-1 levels, and height in paediatric 
patients treated with somatrogon, and paediatric patients treated with once daily 
somatropin, in the course of routine clinical care.  
•  Estimate the hazard ratios of the neoplasms, and diabetes mellitus type 2, the primary 
safety events of interest, between paediatric patients treated with somatrogon, and 
paediatric patients treated with once daily somatropin, in the course of routine clinical 
care.  
•  Estimate the hazard ratios of the clinical endpoints related to immunogenicity, the 
secondary safety event of interest, between paediatric patients treated with 
somatrogon, and paediatric patients treated with once daily somatropin, in the course 
of routine clinical care.

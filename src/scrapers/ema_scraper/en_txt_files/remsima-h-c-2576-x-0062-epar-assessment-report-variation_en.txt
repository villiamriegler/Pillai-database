a marketing authorisation to Remsima on  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
This is a line extension application to introduce a subcutaneous formulation of Remsima (infliximab). 
Infliximab is a chimeric human-murine monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to both soluble 
and transmembrane forms of TNFα. Infliximab prevents TNFα receptor activation by binding to TNFα, 
thereby neutralizing the biological activity of TNFα. 
Whereas initial TNFα expression in response to infection or injury is beneficial, sustained or excessive 
expression  has  been  identified  in  several  chronic  inflammatory  autoimmune  disorders  such  as 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriasis (Ps), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), Crohn’s 
disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). 
The  efficacy  of  infliximab  IV  is  well  established.  Most  of  the  serious  adverse  effects  of  infliximab  are 
based on its pharmacodynamics effects. Anti-TNF-antibodies impair the host defence. This leads to an 
increased risk of infections, including serious and opportunistic infections, and malignancies, notably skin 
tumours  and  lymphomas.  The  impaired  immunoregulation  also  leads  to  an  increase  of  autoimmune 
reactions. Infliximab is also highly immunogenic and the development of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) is 
Assessment Report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/548703/2019  
Page 12/150 
 
 
 
 
known to reduce its efficacy as well as to induce acute and delayed hypersensitivity reactions. The main 
cause for immunogenicity is the chimeric (mouse-human) structure of infliximab. 
Infliximab was first authorised in the EU on 13 August 1999 under the name of Remicade. Remsima was 
initially developed for intravenous (IV) infusion (hereafter referred to as Remsima IV) and was approved 
in the EU in September 2013 (EMEA/H/C/002576) as a biosimilar product to Remicade. 
The reference product Remicade does not have an authorised SC formulation. . 
In  summary,  compared  to  the  approved  IV  Remsima,  this  extension  principally  proposes  two  major 
changes; 
1) a new SC version of Remsima with different pharmacokinetics and  
2) flat dosing (after iv loading dosed according to mg/kg).  
An important aim of this assessment is to evaluate whether it can be concluded that these changes do 
not translate into a loss of benefit or increased risk in such extent that B/R is changed for the SC Remsima 
compared to approved IV Remsima.  
A thorough assessment of PK and PK/PD-data, including a cautious analysis of the pattern of exposure 
and its relation to efficacy and safety parameters is pivotal for the overall assessment and in particular 
for the analysis of the potential consequences of flat dosing (which is of special interests for individuals 
that belong to the extremes with regards to body weight). Smooch    
2.2.  About the product 
The active substance of Remsima is infliximab, an immunosuppressant (L04AB02). 
Remsima SC is formulated at 120 mg/mL and presented as a solution for injection in a pre-filled syringe. 
Each syringe is designed to deliver a single dose of 120 mg infliximab in 1 mL solution. Remsima SC 
drug  product  is  presented  in  a  pre-filled  syringe  (PFS),  a  pre-filled  syringe  with  an  automatic  needle 
guard (PFS-S) and a pre-filled pen (also referred to as auto-injector AI) assembled with PFS. 
Remsima  IV  is  approved  in  adult  patients  for  treatment of  rheumatoid  arthritis  (RA),  Crohn’s  disease 
(CD),  ulcerative  colitis  (UC),  ankylosing  spondylitis  (AS),  psoriatic  arthritis  (PsA),  and  psoriasis  (Ps). 
Treatment  is  initiated  with  infusions  at  weeks  0,  2  and  6,  followed  by  maintenance  infusions  every 
8 weeks  (Q8W)  in  RA  and  other  indications  or  every  6-8  weeks  in  AS.  In  RA  administration  every 
4 weeks, may be considered in case of inadequate response or loss of response. The dose of Remsima 
IV depends on the therapeutic indication: 3 mg/kg (up to a maximum maintenance dose of 7.5 mg/kg 
every 8 weeks in case of inadequate response or loss of response) in RA and 5 mg/kg in CD, UC, AS, 
PsA and Ps. 
Remsima IV is also approved for children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years in treatment of severe, 
active CD and UC. 
The following indication is sought for Remsima SC: 
Rheumatoid arthritis: 
Remsima, in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for the reduction of signs and symptoms as 
well as the improvement in physical function in: 
 
 
adult patients with active disease when the response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs 
(DMARDs), including methotrexate, has been inadequate. 
adult  patients  with  severe,  active  and  progressive  disease  not  previously  treated  with 
methotrexate or other DMARDs.

In these patient populations, a reduction in the rate of the progression of joint damage, as measured by 
X-ray, has been demonstrated (see section 5.1). 
During the assessment, the MAH withdrew the initially claimed indications of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), 
psoriasis (Ps) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and decided to pursue the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) indication 
only for CT-P13 SC with this extension application. This was mainly due to the unavailability of Study 
CT-P13 1.6 Part 2 data at the time of evaluation. This data was considered important by the CHMP to 
support extrapolation for the proposed dosage, efficacy and safety to the AS, Ps and PsA indications due 
to the differences in the use of concomitant immunosuppressants and dosing.  
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
This is a line extension application to introduce a subcutaneous formulation of Remsima IV, which is a 
biosimilar of EU approved Remicade. The clinical development programme for CT-P13 SC includes two 
phase I -studies in healthy volunteers; CT-P13 1.5 and CT-P13 1.9, a phase I study in IBD; CT-P13 1.6 
and a phase I/III study; CT-P13 3.5 in RA. A total of 688 subjects; 253 healthy controls and 435 patients, 
have been treated in the 4 controlled, comparative, clinical studies during the development of CT-P13 
SC.  Multiple  central  Scientific  Advices  (January  2016,  September  2016,  December  2017,  April  2018) 
have  been  given.  Issues  that  were  discussed  included  selection  of  comparator  for  the  comparability 
analysis, endpoints, non-inferiority margin and the overall extent and nature of data required to support 
the application. The use of Remsima IV as a comparator was agreed on. It was commented that if non-
inferior efficacy could be demonstrated in the RA setting and PK data from an IBD population would show 
similar exposure and Ctrough levels between SC and IV formulations, full extrapolation to other indications 
could be possible given that SC dosing and regimen schedules for both the rheumatology and the IBD 
indications were identified. 
It  was  commented  that  the  safety  data  base  should  be  sufficiently  large  to  provide  for  a  meaningful 
comparison of safety and immunogenicity; one year of comparative assessment of immunogenicity was 
considered critical to assess the benefit/risk of the proposed SC formulation given the high level of ADA 
with Remsima IV and the known much higher immunogenicity of the SC route. It was clarified that an 
indirect comparison to historical IV immunogenicity data could be acceptable. 
Overall, the MAH appears to have followed the advice given by CHMP with regards to key aspects of the 
development programme. 
The MAH states that the clinical development programme of CT-P13 SC has specifically considered the 
EU guidelines for clinical trials and biotechnology products. No important deviations from relevant CHMP 
guidance with implications for the overall interpretation of data have been noted. 
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Remsima (infliximab) is currently authorised as a 100 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion, 
also referred to as Remsima IV. 
The scope of this line extension application is the introduction of a 120 mg solution for subcutaneous 
injection in pre-filled syringe (PFS) or pre-filled pen (PFP) (1 mL sterile solution each, packs of 1, 2 and 
4 each, with alcohol pads). 
A Type II variation (EMEA/H/C/002576/II/0060/G) was approved in January 2019 to introduce a modified 
active substance (also referred to as DS) manufacturing process (Process II). The manufacturing process 
II for the CT-P13 SC DS is identical to CT-P13 IV until the final ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF) step 
Assessment Report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/548703/2019  
Page 14/150 
 
 
 
to  deliver  new  SC  formulation.  Therefore,  only  those  manufacturing  steps  directly  influenced  by  the 
introduction of the SC presentation were discussed in detail during the procedure. An adequate exercise 
was performed to demonstrate comparable quality of infliximab formulated for SC and IV presentations. 
Appropriate  formulation  studies  have  been  performed  to  support  the  use  of  the  proposed  excipients 
(acetic acid, sodium acetate trihydrate, sorbitol, polysorbate 80 (PS80) and water for injections) of the 
liquid presentations. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
Infliximab  is  a  recombinant  chimeric  human-murine  monoclonal  antibody  (IgG1)  and  the  active 
substance  of  Remsima  that  is  a  biosimilar  for  Remicade.  Infliximab  binds  to  both  soluble  and 
transmembrane  forms  of  tumour  necrosis-factor-alpha  (TNFα)  and  prevents  TNFα  receptor  activation 
thereby  neutralizing  the  biological  activity  of  TNFα.  Infliximab  bears  the  Fc  portion  of  complement-
activating IgG1 and binds to Fc receptors with different patterns of expression on immune cells including 
monocytes,  macrophages,  granulocytes,  natural  killer  cells,  B  cells  and  platelets.  CT-P13  SC  active 
substance is a colourless to pale brown, and clear to opalescent solution hich should be free of foreign 
particles. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
The approved DS CT-P13 IV manufacturing process and the CT-P13 SC Process are similar. Briefly, the 
manufacturing  process  is  a  conventional  cell  culture  process  initiated  by  single  vial  of  WCB  which  is 
expanded in shake flasks and seed bioreactors until final fermentation in fed batch production bioreactor. 
The  cell  culture  fluid  is  harvested  using  continuous  centrifugation,  depth  filtration  and  membrane 
filtration.  The  upstream  process  is  controlled  with  critical  parameters  and  in-process  controls.  The 
purification  steps  involve  Protein  A  affinity  chromatography  followed  by  a  low  pH  treatment  for  viral 
inactivation.  Subsequent  cation-  and  anion  exchange  chromatography  steps  remove  process-  and 
product-related  impurities.  The  purification  process  for  DS  was  validated  for  adequate  removal  of 
process-related  impurities  host  cell  protein  (HCP),  DNA  and  leaching  Protein A.  Further  viral  safety  is 
assured by nano-filtration step. The viral filtration pool is concentrated using Tangential Flow Filtration 
(TFF). Finally, the concentrated CT-P13 SC product pool is diafiltered and formulated to CT-P13 SC in 
sodium  acetate,  sorbitol,  and  polysorbate  80  buffer  at  108–132  g/L.  After  sterile  filtration  the  DS  is 
stored in polycarbonate bottles. 
The CT-P13 SC active substance manufacturing process is described with sufficient amount of details, 
with information on input and output variables.  
A change in the active substance control strategy has been implemented. Process variables and process 
controls for each step, including terminology, are clearly described in the dossier. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The critical process parameters (CPPs) and critical in-process tests (CIPTs) with their acceptance criteria 
are the same as those approved for IV Process II. The only exception is the process parameters and in-
process tests associated with the concentration and diafiltration step which are specific for the SC Process 
II. Briefly, the quality target product profile (QTPP) was determined for CT-P13 SC finished product (also 
referred to as DP) in accordance with ICH Q8 (R2). In order to ensure production of a DS that meets the 
quality requirements at release, critical quality attributes (CQA), CPPs and CIPTs were determined. The 
acceptance criteria for the in-process tests were established through process development and process 
characterisation  studies  and  safety  considerations.  The  acceptance  criteria  have  been  verified  using 
accumulated commercial scale production data and non-clinical, clinical and process validation batches.

EMA/CHMP/548703/2019  
Page 15/150 
 
 
 
Process validation 
CT-P13 DS commercial scale Process II validation was carried out at the active substance manufacturing 
site and approved as part of variation II/0060/G. The only change to support CT-P13 SC was change to 
UF/DF step 
The final UF/DF and fill step of CT-P13 SC batches were validated separately from the CT-P13 IV process 
with  no  critical  or  major  deviations.  The  results  comply  with  the  pre-defined  acceptance  criteria  and 
acceptable ranges of CPP, non-CPP, CIPT, IPT and DS release specifications. The validation of the UF/DF 
and final fill steps was acceptably performed. 
Shipping  validation  to  support  the  active  substance  transportation  from  DS  manufacturing  site  to  DP 
manufacturing  site  was  performed  using  the  active  shipping  container  which  is  used  in  commercial 
production. 
Overall  the  data  submitted  from  the  validation  runs  are  sufficiently  detailed  and  suggest  consistent 
performance of the manufacturing process. 
Manufacturing process development 
CT-P13 SC formulation has been developed by modifying the final formulation of intravenous (CT-P13 
IV) presentation. The DS manufacturing process of CT-P13 IV and the CT-P13 SC is essentially identical 
with the exception of the UF/DF step. 
Changes to CT-P13 DS manufacturing Process I to introduce Process II were approved as part of variation 
II/0060/G. 
Comparability studies 
Thorough comparability studies have been performed. The comparability exercise for the two CT-P13 SC 
processes demonstrated no significant differences in any of the biological activity assays evaluated. It is 
deemed unlikely that the minor differences for the attributes described above will impact clinical safety 
and efficacy of Remsima. 
Characterisation 
Several batches of CT-P13 SC (Process II) DS and several batches of DP have been characterised using 
an extended array of analytical and functional assays to confirm comparable primary, secondary, higher 
order structures and biological functionality. CT-P13 SC has been sufficiently characterised.  
Low levels of deamidation was detected in all samples at similar Asn sites, similarly low levels of Met 
oxidation were also found in all samples. Peptide mapping confirmed the C-terminal lysine variability in 
CT-P13 SC (Process II). 
The applicant has employed a range of state-of-the-art techniques to elucidate the higher order structure 
of CT-P13 SC, The results (antibody typical) are provided in the dossier. 
A  small  difference  in  low  molecular  weight  (LMW)  species  between  CT-P13  SC  (Process  II)  active 
substance  (not  detected)  and  finished  product  was  observed  when  analysing  purity  with  SEC-HPLC, 
which may be attributable to the variability of the method when measuring such low levels. The same 
trend was noted in SEC-Multi Angle Light Scattering (MALS). 
There is no difference in impurities between IV and SC formulation for Process I as the process steps are 
same for the whole downstream process. 
The  clearance  of  Process  II  related  impurities  (IGF-1,  insulin,  HCP,  protein-A  and  DNA)  has  been 
characterised in spiking studies and shown to remain at appropriately low levels. 
Assessment Report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/548703/2019  
Page 16/150 
 
 
 
Because of the similarity between the IV and SC process it is anticipated that product-related impurities 
would  be  the  same  as  those  identified  for  CT-P13  IV  would  be  similar.  Therefore,  only  the  impurities 
possibly influenced by the new SC formulation were assessed within this line extension application (i.e. 
oxidation and HMW species). 
Specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis, 
and container closure 
Acceptance  criteria  for  specifications  are  based  on  both  Remsima  and  CT-P13  SC  DS  batches 
manufactured throughout at Korea (plant 1). 
The release specification for CT-P13 SC is identical to the specification approved for Remsima IV Process 
II  specification,  except  for  the  appearance  and  SC  formulation  protein  concentration.  The  revised 
acceptance criteria for these attributes have been sufficiently justified and are acceptable. 
With respect to the oligosaccharide profile, the specification limits were revised due to the introduction 
of Process II (same acceptance criteria for both IV and SC active substance). The proposed specification 
aligns closely with values for the combined oligosaccharides. The proposed acceptance criteria for the 
oligosaccharide profiles are acceptable. 
Analytical procedures and reference standards 
The  analytical  methods  are  considered  capable  to  control  the  quality  of  the  active  substance  (DS)  at 
release  and  stability  testing.  The  analytical  release  methods  are  unchanged  from  those  currently 
registered for CT-P13 IV active substance, with the exception of the method for protein concentration 
which  has  been  revised  and  validated  for new  equipment.  In  addition,  acceptance  criteria  for  pH  and 
protein concentration have been adjusted suitable for SC liquid presentation. The proposed specifications 
are appropriately justified and acceptable. 
The  residual  HCP  method uses  new  Process-II-specific  standard  and  reagents.  This  method  has  been 
acceptably 
described 
and 
validated,

application 
EMEA/H/C/002576/II/0060/G. 
Verification of the compendial methods was acceptably performed using CT-P13 SC active substance.  
All compendial methods were verified fit for purpose. 
The  additional  validations  performed  on  the  non-compendial  methods  using  SC  samples  and  SC 
formulation buffer are acceptable. 
An in-house reference standard material has been established. The primary reference standard for CT-
P13 SC was manufactured and has been extensively characterised and qualified in accordance with ICH 
Q6B.  Re-qualification  of  reference  standard  will  be  performed  using  a  pre-defined  assay  panel  and 
specification  to  monitor  stability.    The  primary  reference  standard  is  stored  at  ≤ -60  ° C.  The 
manufacturing  process  used  in  production  of  working  reference  standard  and  the  use  of  reference 
standards during analytical method validations is adequately described 
All  reference  standards  are  well  described,  characterized  and  considered  as  representative  of  the 
commercial  manufacturing  process.  The  reference  standards  used  for  extended  characterisation, 
comparability testing, stability testing and routine batch release testing of the finished product are the 
same as those employed for the active substance. Qualification of the hcDNA standard is appropriately 
described in the dossier. 
A working reference standard will be established post approval and will be qualified against the primary 
reference standard according to a specification. 
Batch analysis 
Assessment Report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/548703/2019  
Page 17/150 
 
 
 
Batch release data of CT-P13 SC active substance is presented for batches manufactured in Korea. The 
batches were tested with analytical methods for SC product. The Process I and Process II batch release 
data is highly comparable and meet commercial specifications. The CT-P13 SC manufacturing process is 
considered robust and consistent. 
Container closure 
No change in container closure system is proposed within the Remsima line extension. 
Stability 
Stability studies follow ICH Q5C and ICH Q1B guidelines. Comparative real time and accelerated stability 
data from process I and II alongside forced degradation data were provided.   
Data remain within the approved stability specifications. 
The photo-stability results show that DS is light-sensitive and should be protected from light. 
On the basis of the stability data provided, the proposed shelf life for CT-P13 SC active substance stored 
at -40±5ºC (45 months) and at 5±3°C is (3 months) is acceptable. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development   
The CT-P13 SC DP 120 mg/ml of infliximab solution for subcutaneous injection is filled primary container 
closure consisting of type I borosilicate glass syringe (1 mL) with a hypodermic stainless steel needle 
closed  with  a  siliconized  plunger  all  components  comply  with  Ph.Eur  requirements.  Devices  to  be 
registered  with  the  CT-P13  SC  finished  product  include  a  pre-filled  syringe  with  an  automatic  needle 
guard (PFS-S), and a pre-filled pen (PFP)/auto-injector (AI). 
The compatibility (leachables and extractables) of the Type I borosilicate glass syringe with plunger and 
the  product  has  been  determined.  The  manufacture  of  PFS  is  appropriately  described.  There  are  no 
overages applied to CT-P13 SC finished product.  
Pharmaceutical development 
Formulation development 
Adequate information is provided for the formulation development. CT-P13 was initially developed for 
administration by intravenous (IV) infusion following reconstitution and dilution of the lyophilised finished 
product.  Studies  of  variable  formulations  were  performed  to  find  appropriate  excipients  for  liquid 
formulation in prefilled syringe for SC administration and for sustaining the stability of active substance. 
The selected formulation excipients are commonly used in parenteral products. Stability studies support 
the  chosen  formulation.  As  requested  for  all  new  applications  a  summary  of  the  risk  assessment  for 
elemental impurities in accordance with ICH Q3D is has been included in the dossier. 
Manufacturing process development 
The  DS  is  ready  to  be  filled  in  syringes.  The  DP  manufacturing  process  consists  of  formulation  i.e. 
blending of DS, from various containers and batches, bioburden filtration, sterile in-line filtration, filling 
of syringes, stoppering and visual inspection processes to produce “nude syringes”. 
Container closure system 
All components comply with Ph.Eur requirements. The stability studies show that the nude PFS is able 
to keep the DP quality attributes within the specification limits and sterile.  
Assessment Report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/548703/2019  
Page 18/150 
 
 
 
The nude syringe can be further assembled with backstop and the plunger rod to prepare the PFS. The 
PFS-S  is  a  device  in  which,  in  addition  to  the  finger  flange  and  the  plunger  rod,  a  safety  guard  of 
polycarbonate  with  stainless  steel  spring  (CE-marked)  is  assembled  to  protect  users  from  accidental 
needle-stick injury after injection.  
The  auto-injector  is  a  single-use  device  that  consists  of  the  CT-P13  SC  DP  (nude  syringe)  with  the 
addition of the front and rear assembly. CT-P13 SC in nude syringe is assembled in auto-injector. The 
container  closure  systems  used  for  the  DP  packaging  are  appropriately  described  in  text  and  with 
technical drawings. Each syringe is designed to deliver a single dose of 120 mg infliximab in 1 mL. The 
primary and secondary packaging of the DP presentations have been properly described for their quality 
and testing. 
Each  CT-P13  SC  finished  product  is  packaged  in  a  carton  to  protect  the  CT-P13  SC  finished  product 
solution from light and from any potential physical damaged during handling, shipping and storage. 
Compatibility 
The  compatibility  of  Type  I  borosilicate  glass  syringe  with  plunger  stopper  has  been  analysed.  All 
components comply with Ph. Eur requirements.  
The suitability of the AI pen has been studied to identify potential risks for the user. The AI components 
are  biocompatible  and  free  of  phthalate  (DEHP).  AI  components  have  passed  biocompatibility  testing 
and comply with the applicable sections of ISO 10993. The manufacturer has provided certificates for 
pharmacopoeial  compliance  of  the  container  closure  components  and  declaration  of  conformity  with 
directive 93/42/EEC 14 June 1993.  
PFS syringes with rigid needle shield and with safety guard for CT-P13 SC finished product comply with 
the  requirements  of  ISO  10993  standard  (“Biological  Evaluation  of  Medical  Devices”  –  Part  1:  2009 
Evaluation  and  testing  within  a  risk  management  process).  The  safety  of  the  glass  syringe  and  the 
elastomeric plunger stopper are ensured through compliance with Ph. Eur. and USP. The components of 
AI comply with Ph.Eur. The AI complies with ISO 11608-1 and ISO 11608-5. 
The nude PFS and the medicinal product form a single, integral product which is intended exclusively for 
use  in  the  given  combination  and  which  is  not  reusable,  therefore  the  single  product  is  governed  by 
Directive 2001/83/EC. As such a CE-mark is not required for the nude pre-filled syringe. 
Similarly,  the  nude  syringe  containing  medicinal  product  and  assembled  in  AI  form  a  single,  integral 
product  which  is  intended  exclusively  for  use  in  the  given  combination  and  which  is  not  reusable, 
therefore the single product is governed by Directive 2001/83/EC. As such a CE-mark is not required. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacture 
The manufacturing process starts with formulation (pooling) of DS batches to produce a single DP batch, 
mixing,  bioburden  reduction  filtration,  sterile  filtration  (inline  filtration),  filling  of  “nude  syringes”, 
stoppering and visual inspection. 
Nude syringes are further assembled with components of PFS or PFS-S or AI. 
The information given on manufacturers and batch formula is found acceptable. 
All relevant sites have valid manufacturing authorisations or valid GMP certifications as appropriate. No 
additional issues that would trigger a GMP inspection have been identified during the assessment of the 
information in Module 3 of the dossier.

Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf-life for CT-P13 SC finished product is 30 months when stored at the recommended 
storage condition of +5 ± 3 °C. Additionally, storage for 14 days up to 25 °C is proposed.  
Stability studies for infliximab solution in PFS, PFS-S and PFS assembled with auto-injector have been 
conducted  in  line  with  ICH  Q5C  guideline.  The  stability  studies  are  presented  to  support  shelf-life, 
comparability of nude syringe batches manufactured at different manufacturers as well as comparability 
of Process I and Process II material. 
Stability data is provided for multiple batches at long term (5±3°C), accelerated (25±2°C) and stressed 
(40±2°C) conditions.  
The  applicant  proposes  a  shelf-life  of  30  months  at  5±3°C,  this  is  considered  acceptable  as  the 
comparability is demonstrated for the DP manufactured at different sites, and for the Process I and –II 
material.  Additionally, on the basis of the data provided, storage for 14 days up to 25 °C is considered 
acceptable. 
Post-approval stability protocol and stability commitment: 
The MAH commits to continue the ongoing stability studies at long-term (+5 °C), accelerated (+25 °C) 
and stressed (+40 °C) conditions of the CT-P13 SC finished product (nude syringe) and the CT-P13 SC 
AI until completion. 
The functionality of the CT-P13 SC PFS and CT-P13 SC AI will be assessed during storage. Any out-of-
specification results will be reported to the regulatory authorities.

2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
This is an application to register the subcutaneous (SC) formulation of Remsima (Remsima SC) 
containing the active substance infliximab which is already approved as a similar biological medicinal 
product to Remicade for intravenous infusion, including a limited nonclinical data package. 
Assessment Report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/548703/2019  
Page 21/150 
 
 
 
Remsima SC contains the same active ingredient formulated for subcutaneous administration. The 
manufacturing process of Remsima SC DS is identical to that of Remsima IV except for the UF/DF step 
of downstream process. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
Comparable primary in vitro PD bioactivity (TNFa neutralisation activity) and binding affinities to TNFa, 
FcγRIIIa (V type), FcRn and C1q of Remsima IV and Remsima SC were demonstrated and summarised 
in Table 1.

Thus, the formulation is not expected to influence the therapeutic activity of infliximab when 
administered subcutaneously. 
No secondary pharamcodynamics, safety pharmacology and pharmacodynamics drug interaction 
studies were conducted and are not required. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
A rat PK study was conducted to compare the bioavailability and pharmacokinetic profiles of Remsima 
SC to Remsima IV in rats after a single drug dose. The limited nonclinical pharmacokinetics data package 
is considered adequate based on that both IV and SC formulations use the same upstream process and 
the products only differ in part of the downstream process from the UF/DF step. 
The  increases  in  Remsima  mean  Cmax  and  AUC0-672hr  values  were  in  general  dose-proportional  when 
Remsima  was  administered  intravenously  or  subcutaneously  (Figure  1).  Remsima  SC  bioavailability 
ranged  from  58.4  to  68.3%  at  20  and  40  mg/kg/day  SC  dose  levels  compared  to  the 10,  20 and  40 
mg/kg/day IV dose levels.

Figure 1 - Mean (±SD) concentrations (ng/mL) of Remsima in male rat serum following IV 
and SC administration 
The SC delivery of Remsima triggered higher and dose–dependent anti-drug antibody (ADA) response 
in comparison to the Remsima IV. Most ADA positive samples in Remsima SC group were observed in 
animals receiving 40 mg/kg/dose (7/10) and 80 mg/kg/dose (9/10). Animals with ADA positive results 
in the Remsima-SC groups at 672 hours post-dose were removed from the PK parameter calculations. 
Due to the ADA response in the Remsima SC group at the higher doses, the comparability of Remsima 
IV and Remsima SC remains inconclusive. Moreover, the pharmacokinetics of Remsima SC in comparison 
to  the  Remsima  IV  may  not  be  representative  to  the  human  pharmacokinetic  responses,  when  the 
immune responses in animals are not predictive to the responses in humans. 
The analytical procedures are considered fit-for-purpose. 
No metabolism or excretion studies have been conducted and are not required. Remsima SC (infliximab) 
metabolism and excretion will likely be the same as for normal immunoglobulin clearance pathways. No 
studies assessing PK drug interactions have been performed and are not required. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
A limited toxicology data package was submitted to support the line extension application. No single or 
repeated dose toxicity studies, genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies were conducted for Remsima SC 
and are not required. Infliximab binds only to TNFα from humans and chimpanzees and does not cross 
react with TNFα from other species. 
A local tolerance study with Remsima SC was conducted in rabbits to evaluate the injection site tolerance 
for a single SC injection of Remsima at 120 mg/mL concentration . The administration of Remsima SC 
to rabbits was well tolerated at the concentration of 120 mg/mL, the concentration intended for use in 
humans. No abnormal signs were observed except for minimal to mild leukocyte infiltration in Remsima 
SC group at 2 out of 5 rabbits analysed at day 1 post-injection. Infiltration was temporary and not seen 
at 7 days after injection. No irritation responses were evident at the injection site.

The  proposed  excipients  (sodium  acetate,  sorbitol,  and  polysorbate  80)  represent  pharmaceutical 
excipients with an established safety profile. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No environmental risk assessment was performed in line with the CHMP Guideline on the environmental 
risk  assessment  of  medicinal  products  for  human  use  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00)  which  states  that 
proteins are exempted from the need for an assessment of impact on the environment because they are 
unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. CT-P13 is a monoclonal antibody and is a protein; 
therefore, an environmental risk assessment is not required for this medicinal product. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The submitted non-clinical studies included the comparative in vitro primary PD bioactivity and binding 
affinities to TNFa, FcγRIIIa, FcRn and C1q, a single dose pharmacokinetic study in rats of Remsima IV 
and Remsima SC formulation, and a local tolerance study in rabbits with Remsima SC formulation. 
No concerns were identified, and the limited non-clinical data is considered sufficient to support the line 
extension application. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From  a  nonclinical  point  of  view,  the  available  non-clinical  package  supports  the  line  extension  of 
Remsima SC. 
2.6.  Clinical aspects 
2.6.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH (please refer to 
Design and conduct of clinical studies in the efficacy discussion of clinical efficacy).

The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
•  Tabular overview of clinical studies 
The clinical development programme of Remsima (aka CT-P13) SC included two single-dose studies in 
healthy  volunteers  (study  CT-P13  1.5  and  study  CT-P13  1.9),  one  study  in  patients  with  rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA; study CT-P13 3.5) and one study in patients with Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis 
(UC; study CT-P13 1.6). The studies are summarised in Table 3; studies in target populations are also 
briefly described below. 
•  Study CT-P13 3.5 is a randomised, parallel-group, Phase I/III study to evaluate efficacy, PK, 
PD and safety between Remsima SC and Remsima IV in patients with active RA. The study was 
conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 was planned to determine the optimal dose of Remsima SC based 
on PK endpoints, whereas Part 2 was designed to demonstrate non-inferiority of Remsima SC 
vs. Remsima IV in efficacy based on DAS28 (CRP). 
Results up to Week 54 of Part 1 and Week 30 of Part 2 were available at submission while the 
64-week data from Part 2 was submitted during the evaluation. 
•  Study CT-P13 1.6 is an open-label, randomised, parallel-group, Phase I study to evaluate PK, 
efficacy and safety between Remsima SC and IV in patients with active CD and active UC. The 
study  was  conducted  in  2  parts.  Part  1  was  conducted  in  CD  patients  and  was  designed  to 
determine the optimal dose of Remsima SC for treating IBD, based on PK endpoints. Part 2 was 
conducted in CD and UC patients to demonstrate non-inferiority of PK based on Ctrough at Week 
22 of Remsima SC compared to Remsima IV. 
Only results up to Week 54 of Part 1 were available during the evaluation. The 30-week data 
from Part 2 was not available at the time of this assessment.

2.6.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Intravenously  administered  Remsima  powder  for  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  (hereafter 
Remsima IV or CT-P13 IV) is a biosimilar of Remicade powder for concentrate for solution for infusion. 
There are no other approved pharmaceutical forms or routes of administration for the reference product. 
The MAH is applying for a new formulation of Remsima, intended to be given as a subcutaneous injection 
(hereafter Remsima SC or CT-P13 SC). 
The same formulation of Remsima SC was used throughout the clinical development programme and the 
same formulation will be used for the product to be marketed. It was demonstrated in study CT-P13 1.9 
that  PK  of  infliximab  is  similar  following  SC  injection  using  the  pre-filled  syringe  and  the  autoinjector 
device. 
Approved posology for Remsima IV and proposed posology for Remsima SC 
The approved maintenance dose in treatment of RA is 3 mg/kg given intravenously every 8 weeks (Q8W). 
The proposed maintenance dose in treatment of RA is 120 mg given subcutaneously Q2W, which was 
used in the clinical efficacy/safety study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2. 
The other initially proposed indications (AS, Ps, PsA) were withdrawn during the assessment. The CHMP 
considered  that  without  data  from  the  full  planned clinical  development  package,  including  long-term 
data and the full additional study in IBD-patients (including data on patients >80 kg with 240mg dosing) 
extrapolation  to  these  indications  would  be  impossible  due  to  differences  in  the  use  of  concomitant 
immunosuppressants and dosing in these indications. 
Rationale for Remsima SC dose selection 
The MAH selected the proposed posology based on population PK and PK-PD modelling. The objective 
was to exceed a target Ctrough threshold of 1 μg/mL in RA and 5 μg/mL in other indications and to generate 
a  steady  state  AUC  over  8  weeks  (AUC8weeks,ss)  that  aligned  as  closely  as  possible  to  that  achieved 
following 3 mg/kg IV administration to RA patients and 5 mg/kg IV administration for other indications. 
It is generally believed that Ctrough is the driver for efficacy. The Ctrough thresholds for optimal efficacy 
were  set  following  a  literature  review  by  the  MAH  and  they  were  agreed  with  by  the  CHMP 
(EMEA/H/SA/3220/1/FU/1/2016/II; EMEA/H/SA/3220/1/FU/2/2017/II). 
Exploratory PK and efficacy/safety data were collected in small open-label studies CT-P13 3.5 Part 1 (RA 
patients; Remsima SC 90 mg / 120 mg / 180 mg Q2W) and CT-P13 1.6 Part 1 (CD patients; Remsima 
SC  120  mg  /  180  mg  /  240  mg  Q2W).  Subsequently,  population  PK  modelling  was  conducted  to  find 
Remsima  SC  posology  that  would  achieve  the  aforementioned  PK  endpoints  for  Ctrough  and  AUC.  The 
selected Remsima SC dosing regimen was then used in confirmatory studies CT-P13 3.5 Part 2 and CT-
P13 1.6 Part 2. 
Bioanalytics 
It is acknowledged that the MAH has developed the bioanalytical methods since the approval of the CT-
P13  IV  product  and  the  initial  CT-P13  SC  dose-finding  study.  The  initial  methods  were  subjected  to 
validation  according  to  EMA  guidelines  and  the  performance  of  the  bioanalytical  methods  were 
appropriately bridged between CT-P13 IV and CT-P13 SC products. Later, the methods for determining 
the  CT-P13  concentration  and  anti-CT-P13  antibodies  (both  ADAs  and  Nab)  in  human  serum  were 
Assessment Report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/548703/2019  
Page 29/150 
 
 
 
 
modified and optimized. Cross validation studies indicated that performance of the original methods used 
in the initial dose-finding study (CT-P13 SC 1.5) and the actual clinical studies (CT-P13 1.9, CT-P13 3.5 
and CT-P13 1.6) have acceptable comparability. The methods used in studies CT-P13 1.9, CT-P13 3.5 
and CT-P13 1.6 were validated according to the current EMA guidelines.  
The performance of the two methods (Gyrolab xP and MSD ECL) for measuring human serum levels of 
the active substance of CT-P13 was appropriately shown. 
During the clinical studies, the assessment of antibodies against CT-P13 followed a standard hierarchical 
approach  to  identify  binding  antibodies  (ADAs)  with  screening  and  confirmation/titration  by  drug 
inhibition, using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) bridging immunoassay. In addition, 
serum  samples  were  tested  for  neutralizing  anti-CT-P13  antibodies  (NAbs)  using  a  MSD  ECL  based 
method.  It  appears  that  both  methods  have  limitations  regarding  the  drug  tolerance  levels  and  the 
performance of the assay at levels close to the assay cut point. Methodological uncertainties also remain 
related  to  the  sensitivity  and  drug  tolerance  of  the  Nab  assay,  particularly  to  analyzing  the  lipemic 
samples from RA patients. 
However, even if some of the NAbs went undetected due to higher drug concentrations and low sensitivity 
to detect low titres of Nabs, it can be concluded that the formation of NAbs was not greater with the SC 
formulation. 
Pharmacokinetics following a single dose 
Pharmacokinetics of Remsima SC (120 mg, 180 mg and 240 mg) compared with Remsima IV (3 mg/kg 
and 5 mg/kg) after a single dose were explored in healthy subjects (N = 6 to 10 in each cohort) in a 
study CT-P13 1.5. Median Tmax was at approximately 170 h (range 72 to 314 h) in each SC cohort. The 
mean terminal elimination half-life (T½) was between 271 h and 329 h in the five cohorts and it was 
similar in SC cohorts and in IV cohorts (Figure 2). The mean bioavailability was 60.56% (90% CI 51.93% 
- 70.63%) for overall Remsima SC cohorts to overall IV cohorts.

Pharmacokinetics at steady state 
In study CT-P13 3.5 Part 1 patients with RA were initially treated in the loading phase with Remsima IV 
3 mg/kg at baseline (Week 0) and Week 2. A total of 48 patients were randomised at Week 6 to Remsima 
3 mg/kg IV Q8W, 90 mg SC Q2W, 120 mg SC Q2W and 180 mg SC Q2W. Primary PK analyses were 
conducted using steady state PK data collected from Week 22 to Week 30. 
The  mean  pre-dose  levels  maintained  consistent  levels  from  Week  14  onwards  indicating  that  steady 
state was achieved at the PK monitoring period from Week 22 to Week 30 (Figure 3 and Table 4). The 
steady state AUC normalized to 8-week interval from Week 22 to Week 30 (AUCss8W) of SC cohorts was 
approximately 1.5-fold to 3.4-fold greater than that of IV cohort. The mean Ctrough levels were several 
times higher than the target Ctrough (>1 µg/mL) in each SC cohort. The mean AUC, Ctrough and Cmax were 
approximately dose proportional across the SC cohorts, taking into account high within-group variability 
and parallel-group study design.

Steady state PK data following administration of Remsima SC 240 mg Q2W is available from 6 patients 
with CD from study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1. A total of 45 patients with CD were initially treated in the loading 
phase  with  Remsima  IV  5  mg/kg  at  baseline  (Week  0)  and  Week  2.  A  total  of  44  patients  were 
randomised at Week 6 to Remsima 5 mg/kg IV Q8W, 120 mg SC Q2W, 180 mg SC Q2W and 240 mg 
Q2W. Primary PK analyses were conducted using steady state PK data collected from Week 22 to Week 
30. 
Mean (± SD) serum concentrations of infliximab versus time by cohort are presented in Figure 4. The 
mean pre-dose concentration in each SC cohort was substantially greater (above 15 mg/mL) than that 
of IV cohort (~1.1 to 1.9 µg/mL) throughout the study period (Table 7). The steady state AUC normalized 
to 8-week interval from Week 22 to Week 30 (AUCss8W) of SC cohorts was approximately 1.3-fold to 2.0-
fold greater than that of IV cohort (Table 8). Mean Cmax at steady state was approximately 3- to 4-fold 
higher in Remsima IV 5 mg/kg Q8W cohort than in Remsima SC Q2W cohorts.

Population PK modelling 
Population  PK  (PPK)  models  were  developed  to  describe  the  PK  of  infliximab  following  SC  or  IV 
administration.  The  overall  aim  of  the  analyses  was  to  provide  supportive  evidence  of  the 
appropriateness of the dosing regimen using the Remsima SC formulation by producing model-informed 
simulations of clinical scenarios of interest. The model was updated when new data were available; the 
results below are for the model that includes data for SC formulation from studies CT-P13 1.5, CT-P13 
3.5 Part 1 and Part 2, and CT-P13 1.6 Part 1. 
Infliximab serum concentrations less than LLOQ were treated as missing in the PPK analysis. Following 
completion of the base model development, conditional weighted residuals (CWRES) with absolute values 
greater than 6 were deemed to be outliers and removed from the analysis. The first-order conditional 
estimation with η-ε interaction (FOCE-INT) in NONMEM was employed for all model runs. Following a 
visual inspection of covariate plots, those covariates that demonstrated trends and had not already been 
included  in  the  base  model,  were  tested.  A  sensitivity  check  was  performed  to  assess  any  potential

impact of the formulation (IV or SC) and/or disease status on the drug model parameter estimates. The 
association between patient covariates and PK parameters was evaluated in a stepwise manner, applying 
an  iterative  addition  and  deletion  model  selection  strategy.  A  2-compartment  PK  model  with  linear 
elimination from the central compartment was employed. Infliximab could be administered either directly 
into the central compartment as an IV infusion, or into a depot compartment as a subcutaneous injection 
with  a  first  order  absorption  rate  (KA)  into  the  central  compartment.  Bioavailability  (F)  after  SC 
administration was estimated. An allometric scaling approach with estimated exponents was adopted on 
central and peripheral volume (V1 and V3, respectively) and clearance and intercompartmental clearance 
(CL and Q, respectively). Between-subject variability was estimated for CL and V1. Emergence of anti-
drug  antibodies  (ADA),  neutralizing  anti-drug  antibodies  (NAB)  and  concomitant  use  of  methotrexate 
(MTX)  were  incorporated  in  a  time-dependent  manner.  The  residual  error  was  described  with  a 
proportional error model. 
Parameter estimates of the final PPK model are shown in Table 9. Estimated bioavailability following SC 
administration was 57.6%. Estimated CL for a reference subject (70 kg; ADA-; NAB-; not on MTX) was 
12.6 mL/h and estimated volume of distribution approximately 4.95 L. The values are similar to values 
reported in scientific literature. Estimated CL was increased 1.28-fold (i.e. approximately to 16.1 mL/h) 
in presence of neutralising anti-drug antibodies. Presence of ADA (in absence of NAB) and concomitant 
use of MTX did not significantly affect clearance after the effect of NAB on CL was accounted for. Post 
hoc  PK  parameter  estimates  were  similar  in  all  patient  groups  (RA,  CD,  AS,  and  healthy  subjects), 
indicating that clearance of infliximab was not affected by disease.

Effect of weight on predicted exposure 
The population PK model indicated that clearance and volume of distribution of infliximab increase with 
increasing  body  weight.  When  a  fixed  dose  dosing  regimen  (e.g.  120  mg  SC  Q2W,  as  proposed  in 
treatment  of  RA)  is  used,  subjects  with  high  body  weight  will  have  decreased  exposure  to  infliximab 
compared with subjects with low body weight. 
Simulations  investigating  the  impact  of  body  weight  (50  to  150  kg  at  10  kg  intervals)  following 
administration of maintenance regimens 120 mg Q2W and 3 mg/kg Q8W were conducted using the PPK 
model. The predicted Ctrough was approximately 7-fold to 17-fold higher following SC regimen compared 
with IV regimen (Figure 5). The steady state AUC over 8 weeks in the entire simulated population was 
comparable for the SC and IV dosing regimens (geometric mean ratio 0.97; 90% CI 0.96-0.98) but, as 
expected, subjects with low body weight had higher predicted AUC and subjects with high body weight 
had lower predicted AUC following 120 mg SC Q2W regimen (

Figure 6). As expected, the Cmax was consistently lower following 120 mg SC Q2W dose regimen than 
following  3  mg/kg  IV  Q8W  dose  regimen,  due  to  lower  single  dose,  incomplete  bioavailability,  and 
delayed absorption.

Special populations 
Clinical studies to investigate pharmacokinetics of Remsima SC in subjects with impaired renal or hepatic 
function, in elderly subjects and in paediatric population have not been carried out 
The product information contains the appropriate warnings for these populations: no dose adjustment is 
required for elderly patients and no dose recommendations can be made for those with renal or hepatic 
impairment. Remsima is only recommended for use in adults. 
Interactions 
Drug-drug interaction studies have not been conducted for Remsima SC. 
2.6.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Infliximab  is  a  known  active  substance.  It  is  a  chimeric  human  murine  immunoglobulin  G1  (IgG1) 
monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to both soluble and transmembrane forms of TNF-α. 
Remsima IV was developed and approved as an infliximab biosimilar. The current application concerns 
the SC formulation of Remsima. Remsima SC contains the same active ingredient infliximab as Remsima 
IV. No new clinical studies have been conducted to investigate the mechanism of action and primary and 
secondary pharmacology of infliximab. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
According  to  the  MAH,  the  primary,  possibly  sole,  mechanism  of  action  of  infliximab  therapy  in  all 
indications, namely RA, AS, PsA, Ps,  CD, and UC, involves binding to and neutralisation of TNFα. The 
Assessment Report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/548703/2019  
Page 38/150 
 
 
 
 
 
binding of soluble TNFα and inhibition of TNFα induced cytokine release from macrophages, T-cells and 
endothelial cells appears to be particularly important in mediating a therapeutic effect in RA, AS, PsA, 
and  Ps;  in  inflammatory  bowel  disease  (IBD),  binding  to  transmembrane  TNFα  appears  to  be  of  high 
importance in mediating therapeutic effect through, it is generally thought, the stimulation of apoptosis 
by reverse signalling and induction of regulatory macrophages. Complement-dependent cytotoxicity and 
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity are generally considered to be of no clinical relevance in any of 
the indications, including CD and UC. 
A  population  PK-PD  model  for  efficacy  in  RA  was  developed  using the  DAS28(CRP)  score  observed  in 
clinical studies as the PD  endpoint. Individual patient simulated plasma concentrations were obtained 
from the individual patient post-hoc PK parameter estimates from the final population PK model. 
Exploratory  analyses  of  the  observed  data  indicated  that  maximum  response  was  observed 
approximately  between  Week  14  and  Week  22  after  the  first  dose.  Furthermore,  the  baseline  DAS28 
score appeared to be related to the maximum response so that patients with a higher baseline DAS28 
score  appeared  to  demonstrate  a  higher  on-treatment  DAS28  score  in  the  presence  of  infliximab,  in 
comparison with patients with lower baseline scores. 
PK-PD model diagram is shown in Figure 7. Effect of infliximab was parameterized as an inhibitory Imax 
model to affect the zero-order rate constant of DAS28 score “production” (kin). A covariate relationship 
between Imax and baseline DAS28 score (BDAS28) was incorporated into the structural model from the 
outset. Between-subject variability (BSV) was included on BDAS28 and Imax, implemented in the additive 
form. The unexplained residual error was, likewise, implemented in the additive form. 
Figure 7 - Final RA PK-PD Model Equations and Model Diagram 
No  statistically  significant  covariates  were  identified.  Effect  of  concomitant  medications  could  not  be 
estimated  because  all  but  one  patient  used  MTX  and  none  of  them  used  azathioprine  of 
6-mercaptopurine. The parameter estimates are summarized in

Table  10.  Model  parameters  were  estimated  with  good  precision,  except  for  IC50  that  had  relative 
standard error of 83.7%. The results of the bootstrap analysis demonstrated minimal bias in the model 
parameters  in  comparison  with  the  final  model  parameters  estimates.  Visual  predictive  check  plots 
indicated that the model could sufficiently describe the observed changes in DAS28 score (Figure 8).

The PK model indicated that high body weight decreased exposure to infliximab. Therefore, simulations 
were  performed  to  investigate  the  impact  of  the  reduced  exposure  on  the  predicted  DAS28  scores 
following administration of Remsima SC 120 mg Q2W and Remsima IV 3 mg/kg Q8W at steady state.

2.6.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Single  dose  and  multiple  dose  studies  with  dense  PK  sampling  indicated  that  exposure  to  infliximab 
following SC injection increased approximately linearly with increasing dose overdose range 90 mg to 
240 mg. The number of subjects in these parallel-group studies was small (approximately 10 subjects 
in  each  dose  cohort).  Due  to  limited  observed  data  it  is  believed  that  the  most  reliable  estimates  of 
steady state Cmax and AUCτ are obtained with simulations using the population PK model. 
Observed  steady  state  PK  data  from  study  CT-P13  3.5  Part  2  indicated  that  median  Ctrough  level  in 
Remsima SC 120 mg Q2W cohort (N=154) was 11.65 µg/mL, i.e. approximately 11-fold higher than the 
target  Ctrough  (>1  µg/mL).  The  proportion  of  patients  that  achieved  the  target  Ctrough  in  Remsima  SC 
cohort was 81.8% (126/154). PPK model predicted mean AUC over 8 weeks at steady state (AUCss8W) 
was approximately 1.5 times higher with Remsima SC 120 mg Q2W than for Remsima 3 mg/kg IV Q8W. 
The observed mean AUCss8W for Remsima SC 120 mg Q2W was approximately 2.2 times higher than the 
mean  AUCss8W  for  Remsima  3  mg/kg  IV  Q8W  in  a  small  number  of  RA  patients  (N=11  and  N=13, 
respectively) in study CT-P13 3.5 Part 1.

It  was  demonstrated  in  a  clinical  comparative  PK  study  (CT-P13  1.9)  that  PK  of  infliximab  is  similar 
following SC injection using the pre-filled syringe and the autoinjector device. 
Population  PK  (PPK)  models  were  developed  to  describe  the  PK  of  infliximab  following  SC  or  IV 
administration. Overall, no major deficiencies were found in the most recent model. Some clarifications 
were requested, e.g. on data handling and alternative model structure and satisfactory responses to all 
questions  were  provided.  It  seems  likely  that  parameterisation  of  the  effects  of  ADA  and  NAB  on 
clearance is not optimal, and the bioanalytical methods used for measurement of ADA and NAB could be 
improved. Nevertheless, the model was considered sufficient for the intended use. 
Simulations  investigating  the  impact  of  body  weight  (50  to  150  kg  at  10  kg  intervals)  following 
administration of maintenance regimens 120 mg SC Q2W and 3 mg/kg IV Q8W were conducted using 
the PPK model. Because the proposed Remsima SC dose is the same for all patients irrespective of body 
weight whereas Remsima IV dose is based on body weight, overexposure in terms of AUC is predicted 
in patients with low weight whereas patients weighing >100 kg are predicted to be slightly underexposed 
in  terms  of  AUC.  In  the  overall  virtual  population,  the  predicted  steady  state  AUC  over  8  weeks  was 
comparable for SC and IV dosing regimens. However, obese subjects were probably overrepresented in 
the virtual population, and it is expected that in typical RA patients the 120 mg SC Q2W regimen leads 
to slightly higher overall exposure compared with the 3 mg/kg IV Q8W regimen. Because the plasma 
concentration time curve has less fluctuation following the 120 mg SC Q2W regimen than following the 
approved 3 mg/kg IV Q8W regimen, the SC curve is fully contained (several folds lower Cmax and several 
folds higher Ctrough) within the IV curve in all RA patients irrespective of body weight. Regarding efficacy, 
the  higher  Ctrough  seen  following  SC  administration  supports  the  demonstrated  clinical  non-inferiority 
under the assumption that the currently approved IV dose is at an anticipated near maximal efficacy. 
Regarding safety, the Cmax will be lower following the proposed SC dosing regimen, and the total exposure 
(AUC over 8 weeks) will be higher in most patients and slightly lower in patients with high body weight. 
PK data cannot address local safety. 
The observed Ctrough levels from study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2 indicate that the target Ctrough (>1 µg/mL) is 
achieved in majority of patients with RA following maintenance dosing regimen Remsima SC 120 mg SC 
Q2W. 
There  is  insufficient  information  regarding  the  switching  of  patients  who  received  the  intravenous 
infusions of infliximab higher than 3 mg/kg every 8 weeks to the subcutaneous formulation of Remsima 
which is reflected in the product information. 
Clinical studies to investigate pharmacokinetics of Remsima SC in subjects with impaired renal or hepatic 
function,  in  elderly  subjects  and  in  paediatric  population  have  not  been  carried  out,  and  drug-drug 
interaction studies have not been conducted for Remsima SC. These studies are not considered to be 
necessary  taking  into  account  experience  with  intravenously  administered  infliximab.  Studies  in 
paediatric population are not required for the current application because marketing authorisation for 
Remsima  SC  is  only  applied  for  adult  subjects.  PPK  analysis  indicated  that  race  and  gender  do  not 
significantly affect the PK after the effect of body weight is accounted for. Adequate information on PK 
in special populations and on drug-drug interactions is provided in the product information. 
New clinical studies have not been conducted to investigate the mechanism of action and primary and 
secondary pharmacology of infliximab. Such studies are not required because infliximab is considered to 
be a known active substance. 
Remsima SC may be given in the upper arm, thigh or abdomen. The MAH provided additional analyses 
demonstrating that the total exposure (AUC) is comparable following SC injection in the three sites. A 
trend for slightly lower Ctrough following SC injection in the upper arm was observed, but it was clinically 
not meaningful.

A  population  PK-PD  model  for  efficacy  in  RA  was  developed  using the  DAS28(CRP)  score  observed  in 
clinical studies as the PD endpoint. Effect of infliximab was parameterized as an inhibitory Imax model to 
affect the zero-order rate constant of DAS28 score “production” (kin) and the effect of baseline DAS28 
score  on  Imax  was  implemented  in  the  model.  The  model  adequately  described  the  observed  data. 
Simulations indicated that adequate DAS28 response is expected also for obese patients with RA, even 
if they have decreased exposure to infliximab. 
2.6.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
No  major  deficiencies  in  the  clinical  pharmacology  sections  of  the  dossier  were  found.  Some 
methodological  uncertainties  remain  related  to  the  sensitivity  and  drug  tolerance  of  the  Nab  assay, 
particularly to analyzing the lipemic samples from RA patients. 
However, even if some of the NAbs went undetected due to higher drug concentrations and low sensitivity 
to detect low titres of Nabs, it can be concluded that the formation of NAbs was not greater with the SC 
formulation. 
As  expected,  exposure  in  terms  of  Cmax,  Ctrough  and  AUC  is  not  identical  following  administration  of 
Remsima  SC  and  Remsima  IV.  Cmax  levels  are  several  folds  lower  and  Ctrough  levels  are  several  folds 
higher  following  the  proposed  SC  dosing  regimens,  compared  with  the  approved  IV  dosing  regimens. 
Mean AUC levels over 8-week dosing are predicted to be slightly higher following the proposed SC dosing 
regimens,  depending  on  the  patient’s  body  weight.  The  potential  significance  of  these  differences  on 
clinical efficacy and safety is discussed in the next sections. 
2.7.  Clinical efficacy 
Clinical  efficacy  has  been  evaluated  in  two  randomised  studies.  One  Phase  I/III  in  patients  with 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA; study CT-P13 3.5) and one Phase I study in patients with Crohn’s disease (CD) 
(study CT-P13 1.6). The studies are summarised in Table 3. 
The  pivotal  study  regarding  efficacy  for  this  application  is  Part  2  of  Study  CT-P13  3.5  evaluating  PK, 
efficacy and safety of Remsima SC in RA patients. 
Supporting data on clinical efficacy comes from Part 1 of Study CT-P13 3.5 (dose finding study in RA 
patients) and Part 1 of Study CT-P13 1.6 (dose finding study in CD patients). The results from Part 2 of 
Study CT-P13 1.6 (in CD and UC patients) were not included in this submission. 
2.7.1.  Dose-response studies 
In RA patients: CT-P13 3.5 Part 1 
Objectives 
•  Primary objective: To find the optimal dose of Remsima SC over the first 30 weeks as determined 
by the area under the concentration-time curve (AUCτ) at steady state between Week 22 and 
Week 30 
•  Secondary  objective:  To  evaluate  efficacy,  PK,  pharmacodynamics  (PD),  and  overall  safety  of 
Remsima SC in comparison with Remsima IV up to Week 54 
Overall Design (including randomization) 
Assessment Report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation

Page 46/150 
 
 
 
Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 1 was an open-label, randomized, multicenter, parallel group study designed to 
evaluate PK, PD, efficacy and safety between Remsima SC and Remsima IV when co-administered with 
methotrexate (MTX) and folic acid in patients with active RA. 
Patients could also be pre-medicated 30 to 60 minutes prior to the start of study drug administration; 
any pre-medications such as but not limited to antihistamine, hydrocortisone, paracetamol, and/or non-
sedating antihistamine could be given at the investigator's discretion. 
There was no masking of  study treatments in Part  1 of study  CT-P13 3.5 and hence, this part of the 
study was open-label. 
There were up to 3 periods including end-of-study (EOS) visit: 
•  Screening: Days -21 to -1, prior to the first administration of the study drug 
• 
• 
Treatment period: included 1) Dose-Loading phase: from Week 0 to Week 6 and 2) Maintenance 
phase: from Week 6 to Week 54 
End of Study: 8 weeks after the last dose was received, either at the end of the maintenance 
phase or earlier if the patient withdrew from the study 
During  the  Dose-loading  phase,  all  enrolled  patients  initially  received  a  2-hour  CT-P13  IV  infusion  at 
Weeks 0 and 2. Patients who received 2 full doses and for whom there were no safety concerns based 
on the investigator’s discretion were randomly assigned to receive either Remsima SC or Remsima IV 
before treatment on Day 42, Week 6. 
The  Maintenance  phase  of  the  study  consisted  of  further  doses  of  study  drug  with  the  last  dose 
administered no later than Week 54: 
• 
IV 3 mg/kg cohort (Cohort 1): further 7 doses of Remsima IV were administered at Week 6 and 
every 8 weeks thereafter (Weeks 14, 22, 30, 38, 46, and 54). 
•  SC 90 mg, SC 120 mg and SC 180 mg cohorts (Cohorts 2, 3, and 4): the first Remsima SC was 
administered  by  prefilled  syringe  (PFS)  at  Week  6.  Further  SC  injections  were  given  every 
2 weeks up to Week 54. 
Remsima SC via PFS was injected at a slow, steady rate at the front of the middle thighs, or the abdomen 
(except for the 5 cm area right around the navel), or the outer area of the upper arms (except for self-
injection). For each new injection, a different injection site was used (i.e., injection site was rotated). 
After dose finding evaluation, the SC 120 mg every 2 weeks was recommended as the optimal dose by 
Data  Safety  Monitoring  Board.  The  initially  assigned  dose  could  be  adjusted  to  the  SC  120  mg  every 
2 weeks  after  Week  30  in  applicable  patients  from  SC  90  mg  (Cohort  2)  and  SC  180  mg  (Cohort  4) 
cohorts.

vomiting, hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitation, arthralgia, myalgia, 
pyrexia (fever). 
Sample size, randomisation and statistical methods 
No formal sample size estimation was performed because no confirmatory analysis was planned in the 
study. Approximately 24 to 40 patients (6 to 10 patients per cohort) were considered to be sufficient to 
investigate the primary pharmacokinetic objective. 
Patients who had received two full doses of CT-P13 IV at Weeks 0 and 2 without any safety concern were 
randomly assigned at Week 6 in a 1:1:1:1 ratio into four study cohorts. Randomisation was stratified by 
country,  Week  2  serum  CRP  concentration  (≤0.6  mg/dL  vs  >0.6  mg/dL),  and  Week  6  body  weight 
(≤70 kg vs >70 kg). In addition, all patients in SC cohorts (Cohorts 2, 3 and 4) were randomly assigned 
by IWRS at Week 14 in a 1:1 ratio to either Group A or B to collect blood samples in the PK monitoring 
visit  period;  Group  A  (Cohorts  2A,  3A  and  4A):  frequent  PK  sampling  at  Weeks  22  and  26,  Group  B 
(Cohorts 2B, 3B and 4B): frequent PK sampling at Weeks 24 and 28. 
Pharmacokinetic Analyses: All PK analyses were performed on the PK population. PK parameters were 
computed by non-compartmental methods. 
Efficacy  Analyses:  All  efficacy  analyses  were  performed  on  the  efficacy  population.  The  efficacy 
parameters were summarized using descriptive statistics. 
PD  Analyses:  All  PD  analyses  were  performed  on  the  PD  population.  Actual  values  and  changes  from 
baseline in RF, anti-CCP, CRP, and ESR, along with descriptive statistics, were presented by cohorts. 
Safety  Analyses:  All  safety  data  analyses  were  conducted  for  the  safety  population.  Analyses  were 
performed on the observed cases with the safety data listed and summarized by cohort as appropriate. 
Conduct of the study 
There was a total of 17 amendments (including 4 global amendments with major amendments and 13 
minor amendments) during the course of the study. The global amendments included: 
•  Deletion of primary PK objective for Part 2 as per the CHMP’s comment that mean change from 
baseline  in  DAS28  (CRP)  at  Week  22  was  an  adequate  and  sensitive  endpoint,  and  therefore 
DAS28 (CRP) would only be considered as primary endpoint for Part 2 
•  Update of the study design for Part 2 including double-blind and double-dummy design.  
Assessment Report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/548703/2019  
Page 50/150 
 
 
 
•  Addition of breaking the blind for Part 2 as per the updated design (double-blind). 
•  Update of the statistical analysis plan as per the updated design. 
•  Revision of the posology for Part 2 from ‘every 4 weeks’ to ‘every 2 weeks’ as per the result of 
interim PK-PD modeling analysis. 
•  Modification  of  the  time  point  of  EOS  visit  from  ‘8  weeks  from  the  last  dose  was  received’  to 
‘2 weeks from the last dose was received’ considering administration of CT-P13 SC. 
•  Changed vocabularies in the description about the selection of study population for Part 2. 
• 
‘infusion-related  reactions’  were  revised  to  ‘administration-related  reactions’  since  the  study 
included SC injections. 
Some amendments related only to Part 2 of the study CT P13 3.5; this is highlighted in bold above. 
Patient disposition / participant flow 
Patient disposition is summarized for the all-randomized population in the figure below. 
Figure 12 - Patient Disposition in of Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 1: All-Randomized Population 
Demographic Characteristics 
The randomized subjects were mostly Caucasian (95.8%) and female (79.2%). Overall mean (SD) age 
and body weight at screening were 49.2 (11.9) years and 70.2 (14.9) kg. The total mean (SD) score for 
the RA classification criteria was 9.2 (1.24) and the mean (SD) dose of MTX taken was 18.80 (4.754) 
mg/week. All patients took MTX during the study; all but one patient took MTX as per study design and 
requirements (this patient did not meet inclusion criteria regarding MTX). Baseline characteristics were 
balanced among the 4 cohorts.

Objectives  
• 
Primary objective: To find the optimal dose of Remsima SC over the first 30 weeks as determined 
by the area under the concentration-time curve (AUCτ) at steady state between Week 22 and 
Week 30 
•  Secondary objectives: To evaluate efficacy, PK, pharmacodynamics (PD), and overall safety of 
Remsima SC in comparison with Remsima IV up to Week 54 
Overall Design (including randomization) 
Study  CT-P13  1.6  Part  1  was  an  open-label,  randomized,  multicenter,  parallel-group,  Phase  I  study 
designed to evaluate PK, efficacy, PD, and safety between Remsima SC and Remsima IV in patients with 
active Crohn’s disease (CD). 
Patients  could  be  pre-medicated  30  to  60  minutes  prior  to  the  start  of  study  drug  administration; 
antihistamine,  hydrocortisone,  paracetamol,  and/or  non-sedating  antihistamine  could  be  given  at  the 
investigator’s discretion.

There were up to 3 periods including End-of-Study (EOS) visit in Part 1: 
•  Screening: Days -21 to -1, prior to the first administration of the study drug 
• 
• 
Treatment Period included 1) Dose-Loading phase: from Week 0 to Week 6, and 2) Maintenance 
phase: from Week 6 to Week 54 
End-of-Study: EOS; 8 weeks after the last dose was received 
During the Dose-loading phase, all enrolled patients initially received a 2-hour Remsima IV infusion at 
Weeks 0 and 2. Patients who received 2 full doses and for whom there were no safety concerns based 
on the investigator’s discretion were randomly assigned to receive either Remsima SC or Remsima IV 
before treatment on Day 42, Week 6. 
The  Maintenance  phase  of  the  study  consisted  of  further  doses  of  study  drug  with  the  last  dose 
administered no later than Week 54: 
• 
Intravenous 5 mg/kg cohort (Cohort 1): further 7 doses of Remsima IV were administered at 
Week 6 and every 8 weeks thereafter (Weeks 14, 22, 30, 38, 46, and 54) 
•  Subcutaneous  120  mg,  180  mg,  and  240  mg  (Cohorts  2,  3,  and  4):  first  Remsima  SC  was 
administered  by  prefilled  syringe  (PFS)  at  Week  6.  Further  SC  injections  were  given  every 
2 weeks up to Week 54. 
After dose finding evaluation, the SC 120 mg every other week in patients less than 80kg in weight, and 
240 mg every other week in patients at or above 80kg were recommended as the optimal dose by Data 
Safety  Monitoring  Board.  The  initially  assigned  dose  could  be  adjusted  after  Week  30  in  applicable 
patients from SC 120 mg  (Cohort 2), SC 180 mg (Cohort 3), and SC 240 mg  (Cohort 4). Further SC 
injections with the optimal dose were given up to Week 54. 
Dose escalation up to 10 mg/kg was allowed for patients from Cohort 1 since Week 30 if the patient 
initially responded but then lost response at each visit.

Main Criteria for Inclusion 
•  Male or female aged 18 to 75 years old, inclusive, with active CD of at least 3 months’ disease 
duration prior to the first administration of the study drug (Day 0). A patient who had CD with a 
Crohn’s  Disease  Activity  Index  (CDAI)  score  between  220  and  450  points  was  considered  for 
enrolment in the study. 
• 
The patient had been treated for active CD but had not responded despite a full and adequate 
course of therapy with a corticosteroid and/or an immunosuppressant; or was intolerant to or 
had medical contraindications for such therapies. The patient had to have stable doses of the 
following CD treatments or currently was not receiving for specified time frames: azathioprine 
(AZA)  or  6-mercaptopurine  (6-MP),  methotrexate  (MTX),  steroids  and  5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASA). 
Assessment Report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/548703/2019  
Page 55/150 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Patients had to have adequate renal and hepatic function at screening as well as haematology 
laboratory test results at screening within pre-specified limits and use contraception. 
Endpoints 
•  Primary  endpoint  was  the  AUCτ  (SC)  and  AUCτ  (IV)  at  steady  state  between  Week  22  and 
Week 30, calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule. There were also a number of secondary 
PK-endpoints. 
•  Secondary efficacy endpoints were assessed up to Week 54: CDAI-70 response, (defined as 
a  decrease  in  CDAI  score  of  70  points  or  more  from  the  baseline  value);  CDAI-100  response 
(defined as a decrease in CDAI score of 100 points or more from the baseline value); Clinical 
remission  (defined  as  an  absolute  CDAI  score  of  less  than  150  points);  Endoscopic  response 
(defined as a decrease in 50% or more of Simplified Endoscopic Activity Score for Crohn’s Disease 
[SES-CD]  score);  Endoscopic  remission  (defined  as  an  absolute  SES-CD  score  of  2  points  or 
less); Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ). 
•  Secondary PD endpoints assessed up to Week 54: Faecal calprotectin and CRP. 
•  Secondary safety endpoints included immunogenicity tests, hypersensitivity monitoring, and 
AEs of special interest included Infusion-related reactions (IRRs)/hypersensitivity/anaphylactic 
reactions  (administration-related  reaction  [ARRs]),  injection  site  reactions  (ISRs),  infections 
(including TB) and malignancy. For ARR throughout the CSR, please refer to the description of 
study CT-P13 3.5, Part 1 above. 
Sample size, randomisation and statistical methods 
No formal sample size estimation was performed because no confirmatory analyses were planned in the 
study. Approximately 24 to 40 patients (6 to 10 patients per cohort) were considered to be sufficient to 
investigate the primary objective (pharmacokinetics). 
Approximately 40 (at least 24) male or female patients with active CD were to be randomly assigned at 
Week 6 in a 1:1:1:1 ratio into 4 study cohorts. The randomization was stratified by region (European or 
non-European), current use of treatment with AZA or 6-MP or MTX (used or not used), clinical response 
at  Week  6  (responder or  non-responder  by  CDAI-70  for  CD),  and  body  weight  at  Week  6  (≤70  kg  or 
>70 kg). 
Pharmacokinetic  parameters  were  computed  by  non-compartmental  methods  using  appropriate 
validated software. All PK analyses were performed on the PK population. The primary PK endpoint was 
also analysed in patients who received all doses (full) of study drug up to Week 30 (prior to Week 30) in 
the PK population. 
The  secondary  efficacy  parameters  were  summarized  using  descriptive  statistics.  All  efficacy  data 
analyses were conducted for the efficacy population. The PD endpoint analyses were conducted for the 
PD population. 
All safety data analyses were conducted for the safety population. Analyses were performed on observed 
cases. All safety data were listed and summarized by cohort as appropriate.

Demographic Characteristics 
The mean (SD) age of patients was 39.5 (12.39), 36.9 (13.35), 38.3 (10.82) and 42.4 (10.20) years in 
the IV  5  mg/kg,  SC  120  mg,  SC  180  mg  and  SC  240  mg  cohorts,  respectively.  In  total,  there  was  a 
higher  proportion  of  male  patients  than  female  patients  (24  [54.5%]  male  patients  and  20  [45.5%] 
female patients). 
The number (proportion %) of patients with current use of treatment with AZA or 6-MP or MTX  was: 
9 (69.2%) in the IV 5 mg/kg-group, 7 (63.6%) in the SC 120 mg-group, 6 (50.0%) in the SC 180 mg 
group and 2 (25.0%) in the SC 240 mg-group. 
PK data 
Please refer to the section 3.3.1 Pharmacokinetics of this AR for summary and assessment of PK results. 
The MAH states that Remsima SC 120 mg every 2 weeks for patients with body weights of < 80 kg and 
240 mg every 2 weeks in patients with body weights of ≥ 80 kg was determined as the optimal dose. 
Clinical Efficacy data 
The proportions of patients achieving the relevant clinical outcomes (clinical response according to the 
CDAI-100 criteria and Endoscopic Remission According to the SES-CD Criteria) are summarized for the 
efficacy population in the tables below.

2.7.2.  Main study 
Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2  
The main efficacy study is Part 2 of Study CT-P13 3.5, i.e. a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-
dummy, parallel group study. It was designed to demonstrate therapeutic non-inferiority of Remsima SC 
to Remsima IV in efficacy in patients with active RA who were concomitantly treated with methotrexate 
(MTX) and folic acid during the entire study period. 
Non-inferiority in efficacy of Remsima SC to Remsima IV was assessed in terms of mean change from 
baseline of DAS28 (CRP) with a pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -0.6 at Week 22 in Part 2 of the 
CT-P13 3.5 study. From week 30 onward all patients received Remsima SC.

Figure 16 - Overall Study Design of Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2 
Methods 
Study Participants 
Male or female patients, aged 18 to 75 years old, with active RA (the presence of 6 or more swollen 
joints of 28 assessed, 6 or more tender joints of 28 assessed and a serum CRP concentration greater 
than 0.6 mg/dL at screening; diagnosed according to the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for at 
least 6 months prior to the first administration of the study drug), despite previous treatment with MTX 
over  at  least  3  months  were  included.  Patient  who had  previously  received  a  biological  agent  for  the 
treatment of RA and/or a TNFα inhibitor for the treatment of other disease were excluded. 
Treatments 
All enrolled patients initially received Remsima IV 3mg/kg infusion at Weeks 0 and 2. At week 6, patients 
who  received  2  full  doses  and  for  whom  there  were  no  safety  concerns  based  on  the  investigator’s 
discretion  were  randomly  assigned  to  receive  either  120mg  Remsima  SC  with  placebo  IV  or  3mg/kg 
Remsima IV with placebo SC starting on Day 42, Week 6. 
•  Arm 1: Further 3 doses of 3mg/kg Remsima IV were administered at Week 6 and every 8 weeks 
thereafter up to Week 22 (Weeks 14 and 22) with placebo SC at Week 6 and every 2 weeks thereafter 
up to Week 28. 
Assessment Report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/548703/2019  
Page 60/150 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Arm 2: First 120mg Remsima SC was administered by PFS at Week 6 and every 2 weeks thereafter 
up to Week 28 with placebo IV at Weeks 6, 14, and 22. 
From Week 30, both arms received Remsima SC every 2 weeks up to Week 54 either via PFS up to Week 
54 or, for patients in Bulgaria, Poland and Russia, PFS up to Week 44 and subsequently via AI every 
2 weeks  from  Week  46  to  54.  In  Bulgaria,  Poland  and  Russia  patients  who  agreed  with  further 
administration were switched back to CT-P13 SC via PFS at Week 56. Further doses of study treatment 
CT-P13 SC via PFS every 2 weeks were given up to Week 64. From week 56 to week 64 only usability 
and safety was assessed and no efficacy data was recorded per protocol. 
All patients were treated with MTX on stable dosing throughout the study. 
Objectives 
Primary Objective  
• 
To demonstrate that Remsima SC is non-inferior to Remsima IV at Week 22, in terms of efficacy, as 
determined by clinical response according to change from baseline in disease activity measured by 
Disease Activity Score using 28 joint counts (DAS28) (CRP). 
Secondary Objectives  
• 
• 
To evaluate efficacy, PK, PD, and overall safety of Remsima SC in comparison with Remsima IV (over 
the first 30 weeks). 
To evaluate efficacy, PK, PD, and overall safety of Remsima SC up to Week 54. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  in  Part  2  of  Study  CT-P13  3.5  was  the  mean  change  from  baseline  in 
disease activity measured by DAS28 (CRP) at Week 22. 
Secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  DAS28  (CRP  and  ESR),  individual  components  of  the  DAS28,  ACR 
20% improvement criteria (ACR20), ACR 50% improvement criteria (ACR50), ACR 70% improvement 
criteria  (ACR70),  individual  components  of  the  ACR,  hybrid  ACR  response,  European  League  Against 
Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria, clinical disease activity index (CDAI), simplified disease activity 
index (SDAI) and Health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) and the 36-item short form health survey (SF-
36) questionnaire. 
All endpoints were evaluated at Weeks 0, 2, 6, 14, 22, 30, 38, 46 and 54. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
At week 6, the patients were randomly assigned with ratio 1:1 to receive either 120 mg Remsima SC 
with placebo IV or 3mg/kg Remsima IV with placebo SC. The randomization was stratified by country, 
Week 2 serum CRP concentration (≤0.6 mg/dL vs >0.6 mg/dL) and Week 6 body weight (≤100 kg vs 
>100 kg). 
A double-dummy design was used to maintain blinding during the maintenance phase up to Week 30. 
The  study  was  un-blinded  at  Week  30  for  reporting  purposes.  The  un-blinded  teams  were  predefined 
prior  to  performing  the  analyses.  The  study  remained  blinded  to  the  investigators,  patients,  and 
predefined blinded team from the sponsor until all patients had completed the study and the database 
had been finalized for study termination. 
Statistical methods 
A  number  of  analysis  populations  were  pre-defined  whereof  the  All-Randomised  and  the  Efficacy 
populations  were  used  for  the  analysis  of  the  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  endpoints.  The  all-
Assessment Report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/548703/2019  
Page 61/150 
 
 
 
randomized population consisted of all randomly assigned patients at Week 6, regardless of whether or 
not  any  study  drug  dosing  was  completed.  Analysis  of  all-Randomized  population  was  performed 
according to the treatment they were randomized to at Week 6. 
The efficacy population consisted of the all-randomized population who received at least one full dose of 
study drug (CT-P13 IV, CT-P13 SC) at Week 6 or thereafter and who had at least one efficacy evaluation 
result after Week 6 or thereafter treatment, and had no major protocol deviation. Analysis of efficacy 
population was performed according to actual treatment received. 
Primary endpoint was a change in DAS28(CRP) score from baseline to Week 22. It was analysed using 
ANCOVA in All-Randomized and Efficacy populations as well as repeated on the Efficacy population by 
the “adjusted treatment arm” defined based on the actual treatment received between Week 6 (inclusive) 
and Week 22 (exclusive). 
Regarding the different definitions above the following example was found in the SAP; a patient receiving 
CT-P13 IV up to Week 22 and CT-P13 SC at Week 24 was assigned to CT-P13 SC treatment arm for the 
actual treatment arm, and, CT-P13 IV treatment arm for the adjusted treatment arm. 
In  the  ANCOVA  model,  treatment  was  considered  as  fixed  effect,  and  country,  Week  2  serum  CRP 
concentration  (≤0.6  mg/dL  vs.  >0.6  mg/dL),  and  Week  6  body  weight  (≤100  kg  vs.  >100  kg)  were 
considered  as  covariates.  The  least  squares  mean  and  corresponding  standard  error  of  the  change 
(decrease)  from  baseline  in  DAS28(CRP)  at  Week  22  was  presented  for  each treatment  arm.  A  point 
estimate and 2-sided 95% CI for the treatment difference (CT-P13 SC 120mg – CT-P13 IV 3mg/kg) was 
also provided. 
The descriptive summary and ANCOVA were repeated for DAS28 (CRP) at Week 22 on all-randomized 
population  by  imputing  missing  values  based  on  the  Multiple  Imputation  (MI)  under  the  missing  at 
random (MAR) assumption. 
The  following  secondary  efficacy  parameters  were  summarized  using  descriptive  statistics:  individual 
components of the DAS28, DAS28 (ESR/CRP), individual components of the ACR, ACR 20/50/70, hybrid 
ACR score, EULAR response criteria, SDAI, CDAI, HAQ and SF-36. The Efficacy population was used for 
secondary  efficacy  analysis.  For  the  evaluation  of  ACR20/50/70  criteria,  any  patient  with  a  missing 
component or not satisfying the responder criteria was to be e considered as non-responder. 
Pharmacokinetic  Analyses:  The  secondary  PK  variables  were  presented  in  listings  and  summarized  in 
tables. 
PD Analyses: The following PD parameters were summarized using descriptive statistics: RF, anti-CCP, 
CRP, and ESR. 
Safety  Analyses:  Analyses  were  performed  on  the  observed  cases.  All  safety  data  were  listed  and 
summarized by treatment arm as appropriate.

1. Five patients were excluded in all analysis populations due to the significant GCP non-compliance of one site. 
Baseline data 
There  was  a  higher  percentage  of  female  patients  than  male  patients  (269  [78.4%]  female  patients 
compared with 74 [21.6%] male patients). The majority of patients were White/Caucasian (296 [86.3%] 
patients) (

Table 17). 
The mean (SD) time since RA diagnosis (year) was similar between the two treatment arms (6.82 [7.153] 
years and 6.41 [6.390] years in the SC 120 mg and IV 3 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively). A total 
of 126 (36.7%) patients had taken at least 1 prior medication (61 [36.3%] and 65 [37.1%] in SC 120 mg 
and IV 3 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively). The most commonly reported prior medications by drug 
class were anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic products (41 [24.4%] and 46 [26.3%] in SC 120 mg 
and IV 3 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively). The second most frequently reported prior medication 
was corticosteroid for systemic use (36 [21.4%] and 40 [22.9%] in SC 120 mg and IV 3 mg/kg treatment 
arms, respectively).  
Immunosuppressants (leflunomide, ciclosporin, tofacitinib, mizoribine, peficitinib) had been taken by 16 
(9.5%) and 13 (7.4%) patients in the SC and IV arms, respectively.

Sample size calculations gave at hand that a minimum of 218 patients (including a 20% drop-out rate) 
were needed to show non-inferiority. However, 348 patients were randomized. The MAH explained this 
was due to fast recruitment and lower than expected retention rate on study, which is acceptable.

Outcomes and estimation 
In  general,  the  clinical  response  to  Remsima  SC  was  comparable  to  Remsima  IV  and  the  results  for 
secondary efficacy endpoints were consistent with the primary endpoint. 
The 2-sided 95% CI for difference in the mean change from baseline for DAS 28 (CRP) at Week 22 was 
above  the  pre-defined  non-inferiority  margin  of  -0.6  and  hence,  according  to  the  pre-defined  criteria 
approved by the CHMP, non-inferiority of Remsima SC 120 mg compared to Remsima IV 3 mg/kg was 
shown. 
The mean decrease from baseline in DAS28 (CRP) at Week 22 was 2.21 and 1.94 in SC 120 mg and IV 
3  mg/kg  treatment  arms,  respectively.  This  level  of  improvement  was  comparable  to  that  seen  in 
previous trials with Remsima IV and Remicade in RA patients. 
DAS scores were similar in the two groups at baseline. However, at week 6 the mean DAS (CRP) score 
was 3.98 in the SC group and 4.11 in the IV group. The difference in change from baseline (-2.03 vs. -
1.75 respectively) seen at week 6 cannot be attributed to difference in treatment. 
Primary outcome 
The primary efficacy endpoint (mean change from baseline of DAS28 [CRP] at Week 22) is summarized 
for  the  efficacy  and  all-randomized  populations  in  Table  19.  Non-inferiority  was  met  according  to  the 
pre-defined  criteria  (lower  limit  of  the  two-sided  95%  CI  was  0.02,  which  was  greater  than  the  pre-
specified non-inferiority margin of -0.6).

P13  IV,  was  conducted  considering  the  treatment  as  fixed  effect  and  country,  Week  2  serum  CRP

covariates. The LS means, SEs, estimate of treatment difference (CT-P13 SC 120 mg – CT- P13 IV 3 mg/kg), 
and 2-sided 95% CI obtained from the ANCOVA were displayed 
Main secondary outcomes 
Secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  assessed  by  the  evaluation  of  the  mean  change  from  baseline  in 
DAS28  (individual  components,  DAS28  [CRP/ESR]),  EULAR  response  criteria,  ACR  criteria  (individual 
components, ACR20, ACR50, ACR70, and hybrid ACR score), CDAI, SDAI, HAQ and SF-36 at Weeks 0, 
2, 6, 14, 22, 30, 38, 46 and 54. Only ESR and CRP were assessed at Week 38 and Week 46. 
The  mean  scores  for  DAS28  (CRP)  decreased  from  baseline  until  Week  54  in  each  treatment  arm. 
Numerically, the results were consistently slightly in favour of the SC arm, but the differences were not 
clinically significant even if a statistically significant difference was recorded at week 30 (Figure 18). 
There were decreases in mean score of each individual DAS28 and ACR component from baseline until 
Week  30  in  each  treatment  arm.  The  mean  decreases  from  baseline  in  all individual  DAS28  and  ACR 
components were slightly higher in SC 120 mg at Week 30. 
Each secondary outcome improved in both treatment arms. Mean changes from baseline were generally 
in  favour  of  the  SC  120mg  treatment  arm  at  each  time  point  but  with  confidence  intervals  generally 
overlapping. 
Efficacy  was  maintained  and  slightly  improved  over  the  whole  54  week  treatment  period  in  the  SC 
treatment arm and also among patients who switched from IV to SC formulation at week 30 (Figure 18).

By week 30 92.7% in the SC 120mg arm and 83.3% in the IV 3mg/kg arm had achieved moderate or 
good clinical response according to EULAR response criteria (based on DAS28 [CRP]) (Table 20). At week 
6 27.3% and 25.9% had achieved good clinical response in the SC 120 mg and IV 3mg/kg treatment

arms respectively. At week 30 50.9% and 35.6% of patients had achieved good clinical response in the 
SC 120 mg and IV 3mg/kg treatment arms respectively. 
Of note, more than 80% of all patients achieved good or moderate response already by week 6. 
Table 20 - Proportion of Patients Achieving EULAR(CRP) Response in Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 
2: Efficacy Population 
The proportions of patients in the IV 3 mg/kg and SC 120 mg arms achieving clinical response according 
to the ACR20 criteria were similar at each time point until Week 22. A slightly higher response rate was 
observed in favour of the SC 120 mg arm at Week 30 (133 [76.4%] patients and 142 [86.1%] patients 
in the IV 3 mg/kg and SC 120 mg arms, respectively). The results of ACR50 and ACR70 were consistent 
with those of the ACR20

PD parameters and concomitant medication 
The following PD parameters were also assessed: Rheumatoid factor (RF), Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide 
(anti-CCP), CRP, ESR. 
Mean concentration of RF decreased from baseline at each time point measured up to Week 54 in each 
treatment arm. Although mean (SD) concentration of RF at Week 54 was slightly higher in SC 120 mg 
treatment arm (170.60 [481.903] IU/mL and 115.17 [321.857] IU/mL in SC 120 mg and IV 3 mg/kg 
treatment arms, respectively), mean decrease from baseline was similar between two treatment arms 
(94.92 IU/mL and 100.93 IU/mL in SC 120 mg and IV 3 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively). 
One  of  the  inclusion  criteria  was  a  serum  CRP  concentration  greater  than  0.6 mg/dL  at  screening.  At 
week 2 (after one dose of IV Remsima 76,7% of patients already had a serum CRP concentration ≤ than 
0.6 mg/dL. CRP concentration generally maintained a consistent level from Week 14 to Week 54 in the 
two treatment arms (Figure 20). Patients in the SC group had a slightly lower average CRP at baseline 
and week 2. This difference was accounted for in the analysis of the outcome by including CRP at week 
2 as a covariate.

During the comparative maintenance phase (weeks 6-30), 339 (98.8%) patients had taken at least 1 
concomitant  medication  (167  [99.4%]  patients  and  172  [98.3%]  patients  in  the  SC  120  mg  and  IV 
3 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively). The most frequently reported concomitant medications by drug 
class during the maintenance phase were analgesics and antihistamines for systemic use (128 [76.2%] 
patients and 135 [77.1%] in SC 120 mg and IV 3 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively). 
The use of analgesics was similar or less common if anything in the SC treatment arm (129 [76.8%] 
patients  and  140  [80.0%]  in  SC  120  mg  and  IV  3  mg/kg  treatment  arms,  respectively).  The  use  of 
concomitant corticosteroids was similar in the two treatment arms (124 (72.9%) 131 (73.6%) for SC 
and IV arms, respectively). 
Ancillary analyses 
In  Study  CT-P13  3.5  Part  2,  post-hoc  analysis  was  performed  for  95%  CI  for  the  mean  change  from 
baseline of DAS28 (CRP) at Week 22 by subgroups according to tertiles of body weight at Week 6 in the 
efficacy population (Figure 21). The mean changes from baseline of DAS28 (CRP) were generally similar 
between the CT-P13 IV 3 mg/kg and CT-P13 SC 120 mg arms at Week 22 in each subgroup.

Data on usability of the auto-injector (AI) and pre-filled syringe (PFS) 
In Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2, usability of CT-P13 SC via auto-injector (AI) and pre-filled syringe (PFS) 
was evaluated in Bulgaria, Poland and Russia only as per the country specific protocol. Patients self-
administered CT-P13 SC via AI every 2 weeks from Weeks 46 to 54. Patients who agreed with further 
administration switched back to CT-P13 SC via PFS at Week 56 and continued up to Week 64. Usability 
was assessed via self-injection assessment questionnaires on weeks 46 to 64. 
A total of 168 patients were included in the usability population, 86 and 82 patients from the original SC 
and IV arms respectively. Patients from one Site were excluded from the usability population due to non-
compliance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  
According  to  the  self-assessment  questionnaires  completed  by  the  patients,  scores  on  feeling  about 
injections, self-confidence, satisfaction of self-injection, ease of self-injection,  pain  and  skin  reactions 
were acceptable. 
A majority of patients completed successful self-injection with both AI and PFS device. Of the patients 
with valid usability assessment performed, all patients were able to successfully complete all instructions 
for both devices. No specifics regarding the nature of the failures could be found. 
Only a few patients experienced a hazard during self-administration. A needle stick in non-critical area 
was the only form of hazard recorded. Almost 5% (9/167) of patients experienced a hazard during the 
first  self-injection  with  the  AI  device.  However,  the  number  decreased  by  two  thirds  (3/165)  by  the 
second hazard assessment at Week 54. There was one patient each at Week 54 (1/164) and Week 64 
(1/159)  experienced  a  hazard  during  the  self-injection  with  the  PFS  device.  The  number  of  patients 
experiencing a hazard is too small to allow conclusion regarding the difference in hazard rate between 
the two devices. However, a needle stick in a non-critical area is considered not serious and the rate of 
hazard is acceptable since it seems that patients learned to be more careful with more experience.

According to the data provided, there was no recording of incomplete dose administration. 
Four patients from one Site were excluded from the usability analyses because of non-compliance with 
GCP standards. However, sensitivity analyses were performed also including patients from this Site and 
these results are also in line with the results above. 
The  usability  of  both  AI  and  PSF  devises  are  acceptable  in  terms  of  patient  satisfaction  and  rate  of 
successfully and appropriately completed self-administration.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The MAH compared Efficacy data from Studies CT-P13 3.1 (CT-P13 or Remicade IV infusion) and CT-P13 
3.5  (CT-P13  IV  or  SC  injection).  Study  CT-P13  3.1  was  a  randomised,  double-blind,  parallel-group, 
pivotal  Phase  III  study  to  demonstrate  equivalence  in  efficacy  and  safety  of  CT-13  IV  compared  with 
Remicade when co-administered with MTX in patients with active RA. The MAH remarked that in Study 
CT-P13  3.5  the  change  from  baseline  of  DAS28  (CRP)  at  Week  22  was  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint 
whereas, in Study CT-P13 3.1, the proportion of patients who achieved clinical response according to 
ACR20  was  the  primary  endpoint  but  both  endpoints  were  reported  either  as  a  primary  or  secondary 
endpoint in both studies. Results for both endpoints across these studies show similar responses up to 
Week 54, regardless of route of administration (CT-P13 IV vs. CT-P13 SC). 
The MAH also compared efficacy data from Studies CT-P13 3.4 (CT-P13 or Remicade IV infusion) and 
CT-P13 1.6 Part 1 (CT-P13 IV infusion or CT-P13 SC injection). Study CT-P13 3.4 was a randomised, 
double-blind,  parallel-group,  Phase  III  study  to  demonstrate  non-inferiority  in  efficacy  and  to  assess 
safety  of  CT-P13  IV  compared  to  Remicade in patients  with  active  CD.  According to the  MAH,  results 
from the CT-P13 IV 5 mg/kg cohort in study CT-P13 1.6 were slightly lower than those of the 2 treatment 
groups  (CT-P13  5 mg/kg  and  Remicade  5  mg/kg  maintenance  groups)  in  Study  CT-P13  3.4  but  the 
overall results across all the treatment groups, including the CT-P13 SC cohorts, between Studies CT-
P13 3.4 and CT-P13 1.6 were broadly similar.

2.7.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Design and conduct of the two dose-finding studies in RA and IBD 
The proposed posology for the RA-population was supported by PK-data from Part 1 of study CT-P13 
3.5. It was a randomised open-label study that compared CT-P13 SC (in 3 different dose levels) and CT-
P13 IV when co-administered with MTX in patients with active RA who were not adequately responding 
to  MTX.  The  study  included  a  dose-loading  phase  during  which  all  enrolled  patients  initially  were  to 
receive a 2-hour CT-P13 IV infusion at Weeks 0 and 2. 
The proposed posology for the IBD population (indications not sought at present) was supported by PK-
data from Part 1 of study CT-P13 1.6. The study was an open-label, randomised, multicentre, parallel 
group, Phase I study that compared CT-P13 SC (in three different dose-levels) and CT-P13 IV in patients 
with  active  CD.  The  study  included  a  dose-loading  phase  during  which  all  enrolled  patients  initially 
received a 2-hour CT-P13 IV infusion at Weeks 0 and 2.

Overall, the designs of the two dose-finding studies are acceptable including the patient population and 
comparator. Comments with regards to PK assessments can be found in the separate PK-section. 
Design and conduct of the pivotal clinical study in RA 
The primary objective of CT-P13 3.5, Part 2 was to demonstrate that CT-P13 SC is non-inferior to CT-
P13 IV at Week 22, in terms of efficacy, as determined by clinical response according to change from 
baseline in disease activity as measured by Disease Activity Score using DAS28 (CRP). Overall, the study 
was a randomized, parallel group, Phase I/III study; in which CT-P13 SC and CT-P13 IV were compared 
when co-administered with MTX in patients with active RA who were not adequately responding to MTX. 
The clinical development program was discussed and agreed with the CHMP through Scientific Advice 
(SA) meetings. The primary and secondary endpoints are validated endpoints and broadly used in RA 
studies. The clinical setting (RA patients not adequately controlled with methotrexate, and with no prior 
biological treatment), the primary endpoint (DAS28(CRP)), and the non-inferiority margin of 0.6 points 
are in line with the CHMP guidance. The CHMP concluded that 54-week data are required for assessment 
of immunogenicity. 
The  eligibility  criteria  for  the  pivotal  study  were  clinically  relevant  and  similar  to  those  in  previous 
infliximab  trials.  However,  there  was  a  discrepancy  regarding  the  cut-off  point  of  CRP.  In  the  pivotal 
therapeutic equivalence trial for Remsima IV (CT-P13 3.1) a CRP concentration of >2mg/dL was set as 
cut-off  for  inclusion,  while  the  present  study  (Study  CT-P13 3.5)  has  included  patients  with  a  CRP 
concentration  >0.6  mg/dL.  Enrolment  of  patients  with  a  lower  CRP  might  lead  to  enrolment  of  a 
population with less severe disease. In such a population the difference between treatments could be 
more difficult to detect, especially considering that the primary endpoint DAS28(CRP) includes CRP as a 
component. The MAH has provided data to confirm that the patients enrolled in Study CT-P13 3.1 had a 
similar disease activity as patients in Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2 (according to DAS28(CRP) scores) in spite 
of slightly different inclusion criteria regarding CRP. Moreover, Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2 results showed 
that CRP concentration at screening did not affect the efficacy results.  
After randomisation up to Week 64, 26 patients in the SC group (15.6%) and 31 patients in the IV group 
(17.6%) discontinued in the maintenance phase. The withdrawal rates are acceptable. 
The primary analysis was performed based on both the Efficacy population (defined in line with a per-
protocol  approach)  and  the  All-Randomised  population,  which  is  endorsed  given  the  primary  non-
inferiority  objective.  The  difference  between  the  two  populations  was  however  negligible  due  to  few 
patients  with  major  protocol  deviations;  in  total  only  four  patients  were  excluded  in  the  Efficacy 
population (two in each arm). Major protocol violations were rare and do not have significant impact on 
the validity of the results. 
Regarding the statistical analysis plan nothing specific has been found on how missing data was to be 
handled in the primary analysis of the primary endpoint. With support from reported outcomes patients 
with  missing  assessments  were  seemingly  excluded  and  hence,  both  the  Efficacy  and  All-randomised 
population analysis seems to have been performed on observed cases. One sensitivity analysis in the 
All-Randomised  population  was  planned  and has  been  performed  in  which  missing  data  was  replaced 
using a method of multiple imputation and assuming missing at random. Given primary outcomes and 
that it was few with missing assessments at week 22 (less than 5%, more patients in the IV than in the 
SC arm) the primary approach could be accepted. However, for confirmation, an additional analysis was 
requested. The MAH conducted mixed-effect model repeated measures (MRMM) for the absolute values 
of  the primary  endpoint,  including  weeks  14,  22  and  30  data  in  the both  efficacy  and  all  randomized 
populations, and provide appropriate point and interval estimates for treatment effect primarily at Week 
22, but also at weeks 14 and 30. The model included week 6 values of DAS28 (CRP) as a covariate as 
the last observed value prior randomization, as well as stratification factors at randomization, treatment 
and week and their interaction as fixed effects. This sensitivity analysis confirmed the primary analysis.

The  original  study  protocol  was  amended  17  times during  the  course  of  the  study  whereof  four  were 
global  amendments  and  13  were  country  specific.  The  amendments  included  deletion  of  primary  PK 
objective for Part 2 and decision that DAS28 (CRP) would only be considered as primary endpoint for 
Part 2, update of the study design for Part 2 including double-blind and double-dummy design, addition 
of breaking the blind for Part 2 as per the updated design (double-blind), update of the statistical analysis 
plan  as  per  the  updated  design,  revision  of  the  posology  for  part  2  from  ‘every  4  weeks’  to  ‘every  2 
weeks’ as per the result of interim PK-PD modelling analysis, modification of the time point of EOS and 
revision of the study population for Part 2. Most of the amendments were implemented during Part 1 
and before the initiation of part 2. 
The MAH has provided a comprehensive list of amendments with brief justifications. The amendments 
were  mostly  clarifying  changes  and  of  editorial  nature  or  in  direct  relation  to  scientific  advice  by  the 
CHMP.  For  Study  CT-P13  3.5  Part  2,  all  patients  were  enrolled  and  randomised  based  on  the  global 
protocol version 3.0. Five patients were enrolled after minor country specific amendments. None of the 
protocol amendments were data-driven and the amendments had no impact on the overall outcome of 
the Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 1 and Part 2. The amendments implemented after the part 2 study initiation 
were minor and had no impact on outcome. 
During the assessment, the MAH reported a major scientific misconduct in the pivotal study CT-P13 3.5 
Part 2 at one Site (with 5 enrolled subjects), which was found as a result of a GCP audit conducted by 
the MAH/CRO. The misconduct seemed to concern only the usability part of the pivotal study CT-P13 3.5 
Part  2.  The  MAH  undertook  appropriate  measures in  performing  a  sensitivity  analysis  for the  primary 
efficacy endpoint excluding the patients from the Site. The study results (primary endpoint, as well as 
usability results), with/ without the site were similar so the misconduct does not change the scientific 
conclusions. 
Appropriate follow-up action was taken upon exposure of the scientific misconduct and two additional 
audits were conducted. The MAH provided all audit certificates. No new concerns emerged in relation to 
these audits.  
The MAH also provided results from new sensitivity analyses of the efficacy data in the pivotal study CT-
P13 3.5 part 2. The MAH performed sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint, excluding one site at a 
time, to show that the results remain unchanged even after removing any one of the sites.  All sites are 
relatively small, with only eight sites having 10 or more patients and only one site having more than 20 
patients (32 patients). Therefore, it is clear that excluding any one site will not have a significant impact 
on the efficacy outcome. Also, the study was overpowered so exclusion of one site would not compromise 
the overall power to detect a difference. 
The MAH also presented a table showing that the primary efficacy result is positive, i.e. non-inferiority 
holds, even when the top 21 sites (31.5% [51/162] patients in the CT-P13 SC 120 mg group, 38.7% 
[65/168]  patients  in  the  CT-P13  IV  3mg/kg  group)  along  with  the  Site  with  the  major  scientific 
misconduct were excluded simultaneously among the total 64 sites.  
In conclusion, the efficacy results of the pivotal trial are robust and any remaining uncertainties regarding 
GCP compliance are not considered to have severe impact on data quality of the pivotal trial. Based on 
these considerations the CHMP considers that the non-compliance reported by the MAH may be seen as 
an indication of improved procedures of the sponsor. 
To support data integrity the MAH has further submitted 3rd party independent audit results from four 
additional site audits and an integrated audit report by the independent consultants. All mock inspections 
were dated in July or August 2019 and performed at the request of Celltrion and at several sites including 
the site which were major scientific misconduct had been reported. No additional concerns were raised 
based on findings from these audits.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Clinical (efficacy/safety) data from the dose-finding study in RA (Part 1 of study CT-P13 3.5) 
CT-P13 120 mg by SC injection every 2 weeks after loading dose was determined as the optimal 
dose for the RA indication based on PK-data from Part 1 of study CT-P13 3.5. Regarding the clinical data, 
the CHMP agrees that the outcome of the clinical efficacy measures in the 120 mg dose sc cohort does 
not appear to be consistently weaker than in the iv cohort. Moreover, there were no apparent differences 
in the clinical safety outcomes between the iv cohort and the SC cohort but CT-P13 SC appeared to be 
less immunogenic. Thus, there is nothing in the clinical data from this small open label study that clearly 
contradicts the SC dose that was selected for the RA population based on PK data. 
Clinical efficacy did not appear to improve with increasing dose in the investigated dose intervals. Hence, 
if anything, e.g. the 90mg dose could have been enough for RA patients. However, the small number of 
patients  (N  =  7  to  13)  in  each  cohort  and  the  open-label  design  of  the  study  strongly  limit  the 
interpretation of the efficacy results of study CT-P13 3.5 Part 1. 
Discussion on the efficacy data from the pivotal clinical efficacy study (Part 2 of study CT-P13 3.5) 
The  baseline  characteristics  and  prior  treatment  histories  of  patients  in  the  pivotal  study  can  be 
considered  typical  for  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  RA.  The  following  aspects  of  the  baseline 
characteristics were addressed in the LoQ. 
Patients over 75 years of age were not included in the study. However, the MAH has shown that AUC 
and efficacy is similar for patients < 65 years and patients ≥ 65 years in Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2 in both 
IV and SC treated patients. Moreover, AUC, clearance and volume of distribution does not seem to be 
strongly age related. Efficacy data  from other infliximab or TNFα products in patients over 75 is very 
limited and actual PK data in this age group could not be found. The PK modelling does not take altered 
absorption into account and is not suitable for drawing conclusions on absorption in the elderly. However, 
the available data on patients ≥ 65 years does not suggest any dramatic age related difference in PK or 
efficacy and as the MAH states, the concerns around the impact of a thinner hypodermis and impaired 
lymphatic drainage in the elderly are mitigated by the location of injection site areas in abdomen, upper 
limbs or upper parts of lower limbs. Thus, no upper age limit is warranted despite absence of data in this 
age group. 
Patients with a BMI ≥35 were not included in the study and there were only 7 patients weighing over 
100kg in the Remsima SC 120mg group in the pivotal study. Thus, data on the exposure and efficacy in 
the highest weighing population is very limited. 
However, subgroup analyses showed that there was no trend in efficacy results in CT-P13 SC 120 mg 
Q2W  across  the  bodyweight  subgroups  and  patients  in  the  highest  body  weight  subgroup  (>88.2kg) 
demonstrated similar efficacy as the other patients. Moreover, predicted Ctrough levels were maintained 
well-above  the  efficacy  threshold  of  1  µg/mL.  Other  TNF-alpha  products  with  subcutaneous 
administration  are  also  indicated  without  upper  weight  limit  no  upper  weight  limit  is  warranted  for 
Remsima SC, despite the limited data. 
Initially  it  was  unclear  how  similar  the  IV  and  SC  groups  were  at  baseline  with  regard  to  details  of 
previous  DMARD  usage  (disease-modifying  anti-rheumatic  drugs;  e.g.  duration  of  methotrexate 
treatment). The MAH has clarified that the dosage of MTX and duration of prior MTX usage at baseline 
were similar between the 2 arms and history of previous DMARDS usage, other than MTX, was balanced 
between the 2 arms. 
Overall, there seemed to be no apparent asymmetry in baseline characteristics of interest.

The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as the change from baseline in disease activity measured by 
DAS28 (CRP) at Week 22. According to the pre-defined criteria approved by the CHMP, non-inferiority 
of Remsima SC 120 mg compared to Remsima IV 3 mg/kg was shown. Both treatment arms reached 
clinically significant response already by week 6. The mean difference in treatment response (0.27 points 
in DAS 28 (CRP)) in favour of  Remsima SC is not considered clinically significant according to EULAR 
response criteria, where an improvement in DAS28(CRP) score of ≤0.6 is considered negligible. 
It is noted that, even though efficacy was measured in terms of change from baseline to week 22, the 
treatment arms were identical until week 6. At week 6, more than 80% of all patients in both treatment 
arms had already reached at least a moderate clinical response. Therefore, the pivotal study (study CT-
P13 3.5 Part 2) is in effect more suitable to show the efficacy of maintenance treatment and the results 
should be interpreted with focus on the change from week 6, rather than change from baseline. While 
the present study design is technically suitable to assess, whether the full potential of treatment with 
infliximab is reached equally well by week 22, regardless of a switch in formulation at week 6, from a 
clinical point of view, the relevant question is whether the achieved response will persist. It is unclear 
how long the achieved treatment response would persist if treatment were to be discontinued at week 
6.  This  is  essential  because  any  non-inferiority  between  treatments  can  only  be  shown  if  there  is  a 
possibility  to  detect  an  effect  compared  to  placebo.  The  sensitivity  of  the  design  is  not  optimal. 
DAS28(CRP) scores were similar in the two groups at baseline. However, at week 6 the mean DAS28 
(CRP) score was 3.98 in the SC group and 4.11 in the IV group. The difference in change from baseline 
(-2.03 vs. -1.75 respectively) seen at week 6 cannot be attributed to difference in treatment. 
The design where efficacy is measured as change from baseline despite a 6 weeks identical induction 
phase blurs the sensitivity to detect difference. The decrease from week 14 to week 22 is limited in both 
arms, thus the sensitivity to demonstrate non-inferiority at week 22 is not optimal, as it seems that the 
plateau has been reached. However, the decline in DAS28(CRP) scores continued after week 6 up until 
week 54. The mean difference in DAS28(CRP) from week 6 to week 22 is clinically significant and similar 
in both treatment arms. Since the SC formulation was consistently shown to give rise to slightly better 
results  than  the  IV  formulation,  there  is  no  reason  to  question  the  non-inferiority.  The  results  of  the 
secondary outcome endpoints were in line with the primary outcome and supported the observation of 
equal, if not even better efficacy of Remsima SC compared to Remsima IV up to week 54. 
Discussion on the appropriateness of the selected doses for RA indication 
The maintenance dosage regimen was proposed based on the Population PK and PK-PD modelling data 
from the original Remsima IV Studies (CT-P13 1.1, CT-P13 1.4, CT-P13 3.1, and CT-P13 3.4) and the 
studies from the Remsima SC programme in healthy volunteers (Study CT-P13 1.5) and RA patients (CT-
P13 3.5 [Part 1 up to Week 54 and Part 2 up to Week 30]). The method of dose selection was endorsed 
in  CHMP  Scientific  Advice.  The  objective  was  to  exceed  a  target  Ctrough  threshold  of  1  μg/mL  and  to 
generate  a  steady  state  AUC  over  8  weeks  (AUC8weeks,ss)  that  aligned  as  closely  as  possible  to  that 
achieved following 3 mg/kg IV administration. 
It is generally believed that Ctrough is the driver for efficacy. However, the role of AUC and initial peak 
concentration in driving efficacy is not known. The high initial concentration of infliximab achieved only 
with IV administration might be crucial to the induction of response and this is adequately reflected in 
the SmPC since Remsima SC is only indicated after a loading dose comprising two intravenous infusions 
of infliximab. 
The proportion of patients with observed Ctrough >1 µg/mL at Week 30 was 81.8% (126/154) in the SC 
120 mg treatment arm. Of note, the target Ctrough of >1 µg/mL at Week 22was achieved by only 28.5 % 
in  the  IV  arm  with  a  significant  number  of  patients  with  virtually  no  detectable  concentrations  of 
infliximab  at  week  30.  Nevertheless,  significant  clinical  response  was  achieved  also  among  these 
Assessment Report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation

Page 84/150 
 
 
 
patients,  possibly  because  of  high  initial  concentrations  and  a  slow  re-activation  of  symptoms  even 
without treatment. 
Regarding efficacy, the higher Ctrough seen following SC administration supports the demonstrated clinical 
non-inferiority. Regarding safety, the Cmax will be lower following the proposed SC dosing regimen, but 
the total exposure (AUC over 8 weeks) will be higher in most patients, though slightly lower in patients 
with high body weight. In addition, the Ctrough-levels were indeed 12-fold higher in the SC-group. There 
are differences in exposure between the approved IV drug and the SC drug and these differences could 
potentially translate into clinical (safety) differences but the observed week 54 data from CT-P13 3.5, 
Part 2 supports that the safety profile of CT-P13 SC up to 1 year in the proposed posology for the RA 
indication is acceptable. 
The observed data from Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2 predicted no major differences in efficacy and safety 
between the selected 120 mg CT-P13 SC Q2W fixed-dosage regimen and the 3 mg/kg CT-P13 IV Q8W 
weight-based  dosage  regimen.  Of  note,  neither  was  any  remarkable  improvement  in  efficacy  seen  in 
spite of the significantly higher Ctrough concentrations in the SC treatment arm. 
However, since a trend for better efficacy of the SC formulation is observable in the pivotal study, the 
question arises whether 120mg Remsima SC could in fact be more potent than 3mg/kg Remsima IV. 
Based  on  the  dose-finding  study  (CT-P13  3.5  Part  1)  a  90mg  SC  dose  might  be  equally  efficient  as 
120mg, even though the small number of patients in each cohort limits the interpretation of the efficacy 
results. In study CT-P13 3.5 Part 1 the mean pre-dose concentration was substantially greater (above 
8 µg/mL) in the 90 mg SC cohort than in the IV 3mg/kg cohort (~0.6 to 1.0 mg/mL) and in terms of 
AUC over 8 weeks at steady state, exposure was 1,5-fold greater in the SC 90mg cohort compared to 
the IV 3mg/kg cohort (AUCss8W = 11860 h*μg/mL ). The mean change from baseline of DAS28 (CRP/ 
ESR) was greater in the CT-P13 SC 90 mg cohort than other cohorts but this was explained by the higher 
baseline DAS28 (CRP/ ESR) score in the CT-P13 SC 90 mg cohort which resulted in a larger decrease in 
DAS28 (CRP/ ESR). 
Based on the submitted data, and the reviewed literature, it remains slightly unclear whether a lower 
dose could have been more appropriate (with similar/ more efficacious profile, and similar safety profile, 
but with uncertainties related to the immunogenicity profile) than CT-P13 SC 120mg Q2W. Nevertheless, 
it can be concluded that the benefit/risk of the 120 mg dose seems overall similar to that of IV 3mg/kg 
dose. 
Subgroup analyses showed that there are no apparent differences in efficacy among subjects according 
to body weight when subjects were divided into tertiles of body weight and patients categorised into the 
highest  tertile  of  body  weight  (>  79.7  kg)  were  further  divided  into  2  groups  using  median  weight 
(88.2kg). In all these weight bands, mean Ctrough values remain above the threshold of 1 μg/mL. The 
proportion of patients who had at least one TEAE, treatment-emergent serious adverse event (TESAE) 
and Infection at Week 30 in Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2 did not appear to be affected by the patient weight. 
The proportion of patients who were ADA and NAb positive at Week 30 in Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2 did 
not appear to be affected by the patient weight. 
To  conclude,  focusing  on  the  clinical  data,  it  is  agreed  with  the  MAH  that  the  selected  SC  posology 
resulted in only marginal differences in clinical efficacy as measured by DAS28 change/ACR 20 response 
across the selected weight bands in the RA-study Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2 and that this applies also for 
safety. Thus, for the RA-indication, there are no signals from the clinical data that the benefit/risk of the 
proposed posology would be unfavourable.

2.7.4.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as the change from baseline in disease activity measured by 
DAS28 (CRP) at Week 22. According to the pre-defined criteria approved by the CHMP, non-inferiority 
of  Remsima  SC  120  mg  compared  to  Remsima  IV 3  mg/kg  was  shown.  The  results  of  the  secondary 
outcome endpoints were in line with the primary outcome and supported the observation of non-inferior, 
if not even better efficacy of Remsima SC compared to Remsima IV up to week 54. 
In the sought RA indication, with proposed doses, mean Ctrough levels of infliximab were well above the 
target levels of 1 μg/mL in all weight bands. 
Therefore, the CHMP concluded that the efficacy profile of Remsima subcutaneous formulation 
compared to Remsima intravenous formulation in RA patients was generally comparable in terms of 
disease activity measured by DAS28 (CRP and ESR) and ACR response up to week 54.  
2.8.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The originator IV infliximab, Remicade, has been approved in the EU since 1999. The safety profile of 
infliximab has been well characterised by more than 15 years of clinical use. Remsima IV was developed 
as an infliximab biosimilar and was approved by the EMA in September 2013. According to information 
provided by the MAH, to date Remsima has been approved in 80 countries and launched in 60 countries 
worldwide. 
Based on information provided by the MAH in the original submission, a total of 846 RA patients, 212 AS 
patients and 166 CD patients have been exposed to Remsima IV in 9 completed clinical studies (CT-P13 
1.1,  CT-P13  1.2,  CT-P13  1.3,  CT-P13  3.1,  CT-P13  3.2,  CT-P13  3.3,  CT-P13  3.4,  B1P13101  and 
B2P13111).  In  addition,  10  non-interventional  studies  have  been  completed  or  are  ongoing.  Post-
marketing exposure to Remsima in countries where it is launched is estimated at 370,108 patient-years 
up to 20 January 2018. 
Across the 4 clinical studies included in the original application with Remsima SC, the safety population 
consisted of 693 subjects: 396 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 44 patients with Crohn´s disease and 
253 healthy subjects. 633 subjects (367 RA patients, 31 CD patients and 235 healthy subjects) received 
at least 1 dose of Remsima SC. It is noteworthy, that in this group of 367 patients in RA were included 
also 162 RA patients who switched to Remsima SC at Week 30 in Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2.  
In the original submission, in total, only 26 RA patients and only 22 CD patients received Remsima SC 
treatment up to Week 54 in Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 1 and Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1, respectively, and 
162 RA patients received Remsima SC treatment up to Week 30 in Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2. In total, 
8 patients (with IBD) were exposed to the 240 mg with every other week posology. In studies with RA 
and CD patients, in total 398 patients have been exposed to at least one dose of CT-P13 SC and 196 
patients have received the drug long-term.  
According  to  updated  safety  data,  including  the  five  patients  from  the  site  where  major  scientific 
misconduct was reported, a total of 633 subjects (235 HVs, 367 RA and 31 CD patients) received at 
least 1 dose of CT-P13 SC and 576 subjects received at least 1 dose of 120 mg of CT-P13 SC in the 
overall CT-P13 SC program (Studies CT-P13 1.5 and CT-P13 1.9 in healthy volunteers [HVs] and Studies 
CT-P13 3.5 Parts 1 and 2 in RA patients and Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1 in CD patients). 
From Week 6 to Week 30, 220 patients overall (194 RA and 26 CD patients) received CT-P13 SC and 
181 patients (172 RA and 9 CD patients) received 120 mg of CT-P13 SC.

From Week 6 to Week 54, 196 patients overall (174 RA and 22 CD patients) received CT-P13 SC and 
166 patients (157 RA and 9 CD patients) received 120 mg of CT-P13 SC. 
In study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2 a total of 148 patients have received CT-P13 SC from Week 6 to Week 54. 
In  addition,  81  of  these  148  RA  patients  received  120  mg  of  CT-P13  SC  up  to  Week  64  (patients  in 
Bulgaria, Poland and Russia for clinical usability assessment). 
The number of patients exposed to CT-P13 SC over all studies is summarized in Table 23.

In  conclusion,  the  long-term  safety  database  in  patients  with  RA  has  been  extended;  however,  the 
numbers are still limited to identify potential rare adverse events. 
No paediatric indications are proposed for CT-P13 SC in this line extension indication and no paediatric 
data is submitted. 
Exposure by subject 
All healthy subjects received a single dose of CT-P13 SC that was ≤ 240 mg. 
The MAH has proposed a fixed maintenance dose 120 mg SC q2w. However, the proposed dose (and the 
other simulated dosing regimens) results in high plasma Ctrough levels. The MAH has submitted updated 
results  of  the  Study  CT-P13  3.5  in  patients  with  RA.  The  database  is  still  limited,  however,  no  safety 
concerns in relation to high Ctrough levels were observed. 
In the original submission, the MAH indicated that most RA patients in Study CT-P13 3.5 Parts 1 and 2 
received a cumulative SC dose between 1320 to 1860 mg. The mean (SD) of total administered doses 
up  to  (and  including)  Week  30  of  SC  120  mg  treatment  arm  was  greater  than  that  of  IV  3  mg/kg 
treatment  arm;  1515.53  (203.423)  mg  and  646.11 (141.891)  mg  in  SC  120  mg  and  IV  3  mg/kg 
treatment arms, respectively. Among 167 patients who received ≤ 240 mg dose of Remsima SC, 162 RA 
patients received only 1 dose of SC 120 mg after switching to CT-P13 SC at Week 30. Most CD patients 
in Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1 received a cumulative subcutaneous dose above 2400 mg. 
Based on updated data from Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2 up to Week 54, the number of RA patients who 
had received at least one Remsima SC treatment was 332. The number of doses and total amount of

Remsima SC administered from Week 30 to Week 54 for the Remsima IV arm and Week 6 to Week 54 
for the Remsima SC arm are provided in Table 24. The mean (SD) total dose of CT-P13 SC administered 
was 1473.33 (300.04) mg in the IV 3 mg/kg and 2829.18 (510.58) mg in the SC 120 mg arm.

1.  Patients in the IV 3 mg/kg treatment arm who were ongoing with the study at Week 30 were switched to 
receive CT-P13 SC treatment from Week 30.  
2.  Patient in the IV 3 mg/kg treatment arm was administered with both CT-P13 IV and CT-P13 SC treatments at 
Week 14. According to the SAP (Version 4.0), this patient was analysed as CT-P13 SC 120 mg treatment arm 
for safety population. 
3.  Visits from Week 56 to Week 64 were only made by patients from Bulgaria, Poland, and Russia. 
In conclusion, the total administered dose for patients in the Remsima SC arm was on average 2-fold 
compared  to  IV  arm,  AUC-levels  were  higher,  and  Ctrough concentrations  after  SC  administration  were 
> 12-fold in comparison to IV. The data concerning potential long-term effects of this on patient safety, 
particularly concerning serious infections (including TB and other opportunistic infections) is still limited, 
and data concerning cancer still unknown.

Adverse events 
The safety assessments of Remsima SC included monitoring of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse 
events  (SAEs),  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs),  treatment-emergent  serious  adverse 
events (TESAEs) and deaths; vital signs measurements (including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory 
rate  [RR]  and  body  temperature);    hypersensitivity  monitoring;  12-lead  electrocardiogram  (ECG); 
physical  examination;  clinical  laboratory  tests  (including  liver  function  tests,  Hepatitis  B,  C  and  HIV 
screening); recording concomitant medications, monitoring for signs and symptoms of TB, chest x-ray 
and  interferon-γ  release  assay  (IGRA);  and  pregnancy  tests.  The  immunogenicity  of  Remsima  was 
assessed  by  measuring  anti-drug  antibodies  (ADA)  and  neutralising  antibodies  (NAb)  at  pre-defined 
endpoints. Local site pain was measured using Visual Analoque Scale (VAS). 
The following events were monitored as adverse events of special interest (AESIs) in the Remsima SC 
studies: Administration-related reactions (ARR), which included infusion-related reactions (IRRs) (for IV) 
and  systemic  injection  reaction  (for  SC),  hypersensitivity  and  anaphylactic  reactions,  injection  site 
reactions,  intended  to  capture  local  injection  site  reactions;  as  well  as  infections  (including  TB),  and 
malignancies. 
The selection of safety assessments can be considered adequate. 
Adverse events in heathy volunteers 
Study CT-P13 1.5 
In Study CT-P13 1.5 the most commonly reported TEAE was fatigue (3 [7.9%] subjects overall; 1 subject 
each in the SC 120 mg, SC 180 mg and IV 5 mg/kg cohorts). 
At  least  1  TEAE  considered  to  be  related  to  study  drug  was  reported  for  4  (10.5%)  subjects  overall 
(1 subject in each of the SC 120 mg [ISR],  SC 180 mg [fatigue], IV 3 mg/kg [herpes zoster] and IV 
5 mg/kg [fatigue] cohorts). These events were of grade 1 and 2, and no Grade 3 - 5 events or SAEs 
considered as related to study medication were observed. 
Study CT-P13 1.9 
In Study CT-P13 1.9 at least 1 TEAE considered to be related to study drug was reported for 72 (33.5%) 
subjects  overall  (37  [33.9%]  subjects  in  the  Remsima  SC  AI  arm  and  35  [33.0%]  subjects  in  the 
Remsima SC PFS arm). 
The most commonly reported TEAEs (≥ 5% subjects overall) were blood creatine phosphokinase (CPK) 
increased (20 [9.3%] subjects overall; 7 [6.4%] subjects in the Remsima SC AI arm, and 13 [12.3%] 
subjects in the Remsima SC PFS arm) and ISR (14 [6.5%] subjects overall; 5 [4.6%] in the AI arm and 
9 [8.5%] subjects in the PFS arm). After SC dosing, ARR were seen in 2.8% in study CT-P13 1.9. The 
incidence of TEAEs in Study CT-P13 1.9 was generally similar to the incidence reported in other single-
dose anti-TNF studies conducted in healthy volunteers.

For baseline characteristics of Study CT-P13 3.5 patients, see Section 3.3 of the Clinical AR. 
In Part 1, a total of 50 patients were enrolled in the study and 48 patients were randomly assigned to 
study  treatment  at  Week  6.  Among  the  randomised  patients,  41/48  (85.4%)  patients  completed  the 
study and 7/48 (14.6%) patients discontinued the study. However, long-term data of SC treatment up 
to 54 weeks from the maintenance phase of this Part 1 is only available from 26 subjects.

During the Maintenance Phase of Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 1, at least 1 TEAE was reported for 9 (69.2%) 
patients in the IV 3 mg/kg cohort, 7 (63.6%) patients in the SC 90 mg cohort, 8 (66.7%) patients in the 
SC 120 mg cohort and 9 (75.0%) patients in the SC 180 mg cohort. 
The most commonly reported TEAEs were ISR (5 [10.4%] patients overall; 2 [18.2%] patients in the SC 
90  mg  cohort,  1  [8.3%]  patient  in  the  SC  120  mg  cohort  and  2  [16.7%]  patients  in  the  SC  180  mg 
cohort)  and  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (5  [10.4%]  patients  overall;  1  [7.7%]  patient  in  the  IV 
3 mg/kg cohort, 1 [9.1%] patient in the SC 90 mg cohort, 1 [8.3%] patient in the SC 120 mg cohort 
and 2 [16.7%] patients in the SC 180 mg cohort). No deaths were reported during Part 1 of Study CT-
P13 3.5. 
Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2 
After D120 the MAH reported a major scientific misconduct in the pivotal study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2 at one 
Site. According to standard praxis, the main results have been updated, excluding the five patients from 
the non-compliant site. However, these patients have been exposed to the study drug and have also 
experienced some adverse events. Therefore, in order not to omit any relevant data on recorded adverse 
events, listings of adverse events are mostly presented here with the patients from the site where major 
scientific misconduct was reported included. 
In RA study Part 2, a total of 362 patients were enrolled for the study and 348 patients were randomly 
assigned to study treatment at Week 6. Among the randomised patients, at Week 30, 325/348 (93.4%) 
patients were continuing in the study and 23 (6.6%) patients had discontinued the study. 
During the Maintenance Phase of Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2 up to Week 30, at least 1 TEAE was reported 
for  76  (42.7%)  patients  in  the  IV  3  mg/kg  arm  and  62  (36.5%)  patients  in  the  SC  120  mg  Arm 
(Table 3.3.8.4). The most commonly reported TEAEs were ISR (15 [4.3%] patients overall; 4 [2.2%] 
patients in the IV 3 mg/kg arm and 11 [6.5%] patients in the SC 120 mg arm), followed by viral upper 
respiratory  tract  infection (13  [3.7%]  patients  overall;  6  [3.4%]  patients in  the  IV  3  mg/kg  arm  and 
7 [4.1%] patients in the SC 120 mg arm), latent TB (11 [3.2%] patients overall; 7 [3.9%] patients in 
the IV 3 mg/kg arm and 4 [2.4%] patients in the SC 120 mg arm) and upper respiratory tract infection 
(11 [3.2%] patients overall; 6 [3.4%] patients in the IV 3 mg/kg arm and 5 [2.9%] patients in the SC 
120 mg. These numbers include patients from the site where major scientific misconduct was reported. 
In study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2, up to week 30, a total of 3 deaths were reported during the treatment period 
up to and including Week 30; 1 patient in SC 120 mg treatment arm and 2 patients and IV 3 mg/kg 
treatment arm. With the updated safety data, two additional deaths were reported in those patients who 
switched from Remsima IV to SC at Week 30.

Abbreviations: ARR, administration-related reaction; ISR, injection site reaction; IV, intravenous; SC, 
subcutaneous; TEAE, treatment-emergent adverse event; TESAE, treatment-emergent serious adverse event. 
Note: The total number of TEAEs included all-patient events. At each level of summarization, a patient was counted 
once if they reported one or more events. The event was considered to be related to the study drug by the 
investigator if the relationship was defined as “possible”, “probable”, or “definite”. 
During the Maintenance Phase of Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1, at least 1 TEAE was reported for 10 (76.9%) 
patients in the IV 5 mg/kg cohort, 9 (81.8%) patients in the SC 120 mg cohort, 8 (66.7%) patients in 
the SC 180 mg cohort and 6 (75.0%) patients in the SC 240 mg cohort. The most commonly reported 
TEAEs (≥ 10% patients overall) were (aggravation of) Crohn’s disease (5 [11.4%] patients overall) and 
ISR (5 [11.4%] patients overall). ISRs were all reported in the SC cohorts. Many of the events observed 
were related to the underlying disease. Two deaths were reported in Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1. 
Summary of frequently reported AEs across studies and severity of AEs 
Frequently reported AEs in the healthy control studies included fatigue, CPK increase and ISR. Frequently 
reported AEs in the patient populations included ISR, infections and aggravation of underlying disease. 
In  study  CT-P13  1.5  in  healthy  volunteers,  all  TEAEs  were  Grade  1  (mild)  or  Grade  2  (moderate)  in 
severity. In study CT-P13 1.9, the MAH states that the majority of TEAEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in 
severity and that all ISRs and ARRs were Grade 1 in severity. In study CT-P13 1.9 in healthy volunteers, 
at least one Grade 3 or higher TEAE was reported for 15 (7.0%) subjects overall (8 [7.3%] subjects in

the CT-P13 SC AI arm and 7 [6.6%] subjects in the CT-P13 SC PFS arm). These included CPK increased 
and neutropenia. 
In  study  CT-P13  3.5,  Part  1,  no  Grade  4  or  higher  events  were  reported  up  to  Week  54  during  the 
maintenance phase. At least one Grade 3 TEAE was reported for 2 (15.4%) patients in the IV 3 mg/kg 
cohort,  3  (27.3%)  patients  in  the  SC  90  mg  cohort,  1  (8.3%)  patient  in  the  SC  120  mg  cohort  and 
3 (25.0%) patients in the SC 180 mg cohort. The only Grade 3 TEAE reported for more than 1 patient 
overall  was  ARR  (2  [4.2%]  patients  overall;  1  [9.1%]  patient  in  the  SC  90  mg  cohort  and  1  [8.3%] 
patient in the SC 120 mg cohort). 
In the original submission in Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2, most patients were reported to have experienced 
TEAEs with Grade 1 or 2 in severity (66 [37.1%] patients in the IV 3 mg/kg arm and 51 [30.0%] patients 
in the SC 120 mg arm) during the maintenance phase up to Week 30. At least one Grade 3 or higher 
TEAE  was  reported  for  10  (5.6%)  patients  in  the  IV  3  mg/kg  arm  and  11  (6.5%)  patients  in  the  SC 
120 mg  arm.  Grade  3 or higher  TEAEs  reported  for  more  than 1  patient  were  neutropenia  (5  [1.4%] 
patients overall; 2 [1.1%] patients in the IV 3 mg/kg arm and 3 [1.8%] patients in the SC 120 mg arm) 
and vertigo positional (2 [0.6%] patients overall, both in the IV 3 mg/kg arm). 
According to updated study results in Study CT-P13 3.5 up to Week 64, excluding the five patients from 
the site where major scientific misconduct was reported, the proportion of patients who experienced at 
least  1  TEAE  during  the  maintenance  phase  was  slightly  higher  in  the  IV  3  mg/kg  treatment  arm, 
compared to the SC 120 mg treatment arm (92 [54.8%] patients and 117 [66.9%] patients in SC 120 mg 
and IV 3 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively). 
The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  during  the  maintenance  phase  for  patients  in  the  SC  120  mg 
treatment  arm,  considered  as  related to  study  medical  were  localised  ISR  (30  [17.9%]  patients)  and 
infections and infestations (30 [17.9%] patients). 
The most frequently reported related TEAEs during the maintenance phase for patients in the IV 3 mg/kg 
treatment arm were localised ISR (22 [12.6%] patients) and infections and infestations (26 [14.9%]). 
The incidence of related TB was 8 (4.8%) patients in the SC arm and 7 (4.0%) patients in the IV arm. 
The proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 TEAE on or after Week 30 was similar between 
two treatment arms after switching from IV 3 mg/kg to SC 120 mg. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs on or after Week 30 for patients in the SC 120 mg treatment arm 
were  localized  ISR  (24  [14.3%]  patients)  followed  by  latent  TB  and  urinary  tract  infection  (7  [4.2%] 
patients each). The most frequently reported TEAEs on or after Week 30 for patients in the IV 3 mg/kg 
treatment arm were localized ISR (20 [11.4%] patients) followed by latent TB and viral upper respiratory 
tract infection (9 [5.1%] patients). 
The majority of TEAEs in the maintenance phase of Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2were CTCAE grade 1 or 2 in 
intensity.  The  number  of  patients  who  experienced  at  least  one  grade  3  TEAE  considered  by  the 
investigator  to  be  related  to  study  drug  during  the  maintenance  phase  was  reported  for  18  (5.2%) 
patients  (11  [6.5%]  patients  and  7  [4.0%]  patients  in  SC  120  mg  and  IV  3  mg/kg  treatment  arms, 
respectively). 
Four grade 4 TEAEs during the maintenance phase were reported for 3 patients (2 [1.2%] patients and 
1 [0.6%] patient in the SC 120 mg and IV 3 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively). All grade 4 TEAEs 
were neutropenia and were considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug. Of these, the 
grade 4 TEAE in the SC 120 mg treatment arm was reported as TESAE. Deaths are discussed later in 
this document. 
In the dose-finding study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1 in patients with CD, at least one Grade 3 or higher TEAE 
was reported for 2 (15.4%) patients in the IV 5 mg/kg cohort, 2 (18.2%) patients in the SC 120 mg

cohort,  1  (8.3%)  patient  in  the  SC  180  mg  cohort  and  3  (37.5%)  patients  in  the  SC  240  mg  cohort 
during the maintenance phase. Grade 3 or higher TEAEs reported for more than 1 patient were anaemia 
(2 [4.5%] patients overall; 1 [7.7%] patient in the IV 5 mg/kg cohort and 1 [12.5%] patient in the SC 
240 mg cohort) and (aggravation of) Crohn’s disease (2 [4.5%] patients overall; 1 [7.7%] patient in the 
IV 5 mg/kg cohort and 1 [9.1%] patient in the SC 120 mg cohort). 
Adverse events of special interest 
During the development programme of Remsima SC, the following events were evaluated as protocol-
defined AESIs: 
•  ARRs (IRRs/hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions) 
• 
• 
ISRs 
Infections (including TB) 
•  Malignancy (only in Study CT-P13 3.5 Parts 1 and 2 and Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1). 
Administration related reactions and injection site reactions 
Healthy volunteer studies 
In Study CT-P13 1.5, an ISR was reported for 2 (5.3%) subjects overall. Both events were Grade 1 in 
severity; one subject in the SC 120 mg cohort and one subject in SC 180 mg cohort experienced an ISR 
with a sign and symptom of bruise that was considered by the Investigator to be unlikely related to study 
drug. No TEAEs classified as IRRs (ARRs), hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions were reported. 
In Study CT-P13 1.9, at least 1 ISR was reported for 5 (4.6%) subjects in the CT-P13 SC AI arm and 
9 (8.5%) subjects in the CT-P13 SC PFS arm. All ISRs were Grade 1 in intensity. The most common sign 
and  symptom  was  erythema.  Most  subjects  did  not  receive  treatment  for  the  ISR  and  all  subjects 
recovered. 
In Study CT-P13 1.9, ARRs occurring within 24 hours from study drug administration were reported for 
3 (2.8%) subjects in each treatment arm; all ARRs were Grade 1 in intensity and all subjects recovered. 
In addition, after 24 hours from study drug administration, serum sickness-like reactions were reported 
for  3  (2.8%)  subjects in the  CT-P13  SC  AI  arm  and  1  (0.9%)  subject in the CT-P13  SC  PFS  arm. All 
subjects recovered after receiving treatment for the events. 
The MAH has performed literature review and re-analysis of the serum sickness-like reactions (SSLR). 
The MAH has concluded that based on additional investigation of the cases and based on systematical 
review of the literature, the reported cases of SSLR in healthy volunteers in Study CT-P13 1.9, which is 
a  single  dose  study,  cannot  qualify  as  serum  sickness  events.  As  the  MAH  indicates,  serum  sickness 
typically occurs in patients who received repeated doses of infliximab or have preexisting hypersensitivity 
to murine products and therefore were able to form immune complexes and ADA from previous exposure. 
Secondly, published literature clearly indicate that the most important risk factor for emergence of serum 
sickness is episodic treatment, so prolonged drug free period which enables for immune complexes to 
be formed to trigger serum sickness. Based on analysis, the MAH concludes, the events in Study CT-P13 
1.9  can  be  categorized  as  delayed  injection  reactions  and  severe  injection  site  reactions,  but  not  as 
serum sickness events, in line with literature on infliximab related safety and infusion-related events. 
Patients with RA in study CT-P13 3.5  
Part 1 
During the Maintenance Phase of Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 1, at least 1 ISR was reported for 2 (18.2%) 
patients in the SC 90 mg cohort, 1 (8.3%) patient in the SC 120 mg cohort and 2 (16.7%) patients in 
Assessment Report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation

the SC 180 mg cohort, and no patients in the IV cohort. All events were Grade 1 or 2 in intensity and all 
patients recovered; no action was taken with study drug for 4 of the 5 patients. The most commonly 
reported  sign  and  symptom  was  injection  site  erythema,  which  was  reported  for  all  5  patients  who 
experienced an ISR. 
During the Maintenance Phase at least 1 TEAE classified as ARR and occurring within 24 hours of study 
drug administration was reported for 1 (7.7%) patient in the IV 3 mg/kg cohort, 1 (9.1%) patient in the 
SC 90 mg cohort, 1 (8.3%) patient in the SC 120 mg cohort and no patients in the SC 180 mg cohort. 
ARR occurring more than 24 hours after study drug administration were reported for 2 (16.7%) patients 
in the SC 120 mg cohort and no patients in the other cohorts. For both patients, the ARRs were reported 
as an IRR in the eCRF. Both patients recovered. 
Part 2 
The MAH has also reclassified the ARR, as the terminology used in the SmPC was somewhat confusing. 
The following new terminology has been used in the classification of events (Table 35 below).

Original submission 
During the Maintenance Phase of Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2, at least 1 TEAE classified as ISR was reported 
for 4 (2.2%) patients in the IV 3 mg/kg arm and 11 (6.5%) patients in the SC 120 mg arm. Among the 
4  patients  who  experienced  at  least  1  TEAE  classified  as  ISR  in  the  IV  3  mg/kg  arm,  3  patients 
experienced the events after injection of placebo SC and 1 patient experienced the event after injection 
of Remsima SC when switching to SC 120 mg at Week 30. All these events were Grade 1 or 2 in intensity 
and all the patients recovered. No action was taken with study drug for except for 1 patient in the IV 
3 mg/kg arm for whom the study drug was interrupted after the SC injection at Week 30. 
During the Maintenance Phase of Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2, Treatment-emergent AEs classified as ARRs 
were reported in 9 (2.6%) patients in total, with lower proportion of patients in the SC 120 mg treatment 
arm compared to the IV 3 mg/kg treatment arm (1 [0.6%] patient and 8 [4.5%] patients in SC 120 mg 
and  IV  3  mg/kg  treatment  arms,  respectively).  Among  these  patients,  TEAE  classified  as  delayed 
hypersensitivity (ARRs that occurred after 24 hours from the study drug administration) was reported 
for 1 (0.6%) patient in SC 120 mg treatment arm only, with no signs of serum sickness. Five patients

were ADA and NAb positive when ARR occurred who were all from IV 3 mg/kg treatment arm. Most of 
the  patients  who  experienced  at  least  1  TEAE  classified  as  ARRs  during  the  maintenance  phase  had 
received  pre-medications  of  antihistamine,  hydrocortisone,  paracetamol,  and/or  non-sedating 
antihistamine prior to the study drug administration when ARR occurred. 
In cases of delayed hypersensitivity which occurred after 24 hours of study drug administration, including 
serum sickness-like reactions (myalgia with fever or rash, arthralgia, lymphadenopathy, skin eruption, 
or edema), the following assessments were additionally performed to determine serum sickness during 
the study period: immunogenicity, clinical laboratory analyses, complement (C3, C4) and total hemolytic 
complement.  In  Study  CT-P13  3.5  Parts  1  and  2  and  in  Study  CT-P13  1.6  Part  1,  these  additional 
assessments  were  performed  on  patients  experiencing  ARRs  more  than  24  hours  after  study  drug 
administration. No confirmed cases of serum sickness were reported in the CT-P13 SC studies in RA and 
CD. 
Exploratory analyses revealed that there were more acute ARR (< 24 hours) in Remsima IV group and 
more delayed ARR (> 24 hours) in the Remsima SC group. However, the numbers are small and 3 out 
of 4 events in the SC arm occurred in study CT- P13 3.5 Part 1 and only 1 in 170 patients in the study 
CT-P13 3.5 Part 2 in Remsima SC 120 mg arm. 
Updated  safety  data,  excluding the  five  patients  from  the  site  where  major  scientific  misconduct  was 
reported 
The MAH has now revised the terminology concerning IRR to make these distinctions clearer in CT-P13 
3.5 Part 2 Statistical Analysis Plan. Only the terminology has been revised and the corresponding capture 
logics have not been changed. Specifically, ARR was revised to IRR and systemic injection reaction (SIR) 
for the CT-P13 IV and CT-P13 SC arms, respectively, to distinguish systemic reactions as per the route 
of administration. ISR was revised to localised ISR to specify that these reactions occurred around the 
injection site only, and to differentiate from systemic reactions (IRR and SIR). Of note, IRR or SIR that 
occurred after 24 hours from study drug administration were maintained as “delayed hypersensitivity”. 
All delayed hypersensitivity cases were examined to determine if these cases were serum sickness or 
not. Based on these new classifications, the MAH has performed updated analysis with more mature data 
from Study CT-P13 3.5. While evaluating the results, it needs to be considered, that patients in the IV 
arm were actually treated with IV Remsima only until week 30 and were thereafter switched to Remsima 
SC for weeks 30-54. 
Treatment-emergent  AEs  classified  as  IRR  during  the  treatment  period  were  reported  for  2  (1.2%) 
patients in SC 120 mg treatment arm and 10 (5.7%) patients in IV 3 mg/kg treatment arm. Treatment-
emergent AEs classified as SIR during the treatment period were reported for 2 (1.2%) patients in SC 
120 mg treatment arm and 3 (1.7%) patients in IV 3 mg/kg treatment arm. 
Treatment-emergent  AEs  classified  as  delayed  hypersensitivity  during  the  treatment  period  were 
reported  for  5  (3.0%)  patients  in  SC  120  mg  treatment  arm  and  1  (0.6%)  patient  in  IV  3  mg/kg 
treatment arm. Treatment-emergent AEs classified as localised ISR during the treatment period were 
reported for 30 (17.9%) patients in SC 120 mg treatment arm and 22 (12.6%) patients in IV 3 mg/kg 
treatment arm. 
In the SPC the safety data is reported as incidence per 100 patient years, excluding patients from the 
non-compliant  site.  The  incidence  of  systemic  injection  reactions  (e.g.  rash,  pruritus,  flushing  and 
oedema) was 1.2 per 100 patient-years in the Remsima subcutaneous group (from Week 6) and 2.1 per 
100  patient-years  in  the  Remsima  intravenous  group  who  switched  to  Remsima  subcutaneous 
administration (from Week 30). All systemic injection reactions were mild to moderate.

The  incidence  of  localised  injection  site  reactions  (e.g.  injection  site  erythema,  pain,  pruritus  and 
swelling) was 17.6 per 100 patient-years in the Remsima subcutaneous group (from Week 6) and 21.4 
per 100 patient-years in those who switched to Remsima subcutaneous administration (from Week 30). 
Patients with CD in study CT-P13 1.6  
During the Maintenance Phase of Part 1, ISR was reported for 1 (9.1%) patient in the SC 120 mg cohort, 
3 (25.0%) patients in the SC 180 mg cohort and 1 (12.5%) patient in the SC 240 mg cohort. 
During the Maintenance Phase of Part 1, at least 1 TEAE classified as ARR and occurring within 24 hours 
of study drug administration was reported for 1 (7.7%) patient in the IV 5 mg/kg cohort and no patients 
in the SC cohorts. At least 1 TEAE classified as ARR and occurring more than 24 hours after study drug 
administration was reported for 1 (12.5%) patient in the SC 240 mg cohort and no patients in the other 
cohorts; no action was taken with study drug and the patient recovered without receiving treatment for 
the event. 
Infections 
Healthy volunteer studies 
In Study CT-P13 1.5, TEAEs classified as infection were reported for 2 (5.3%) subjects overall, both in 
the  IV  arm.  One  subject  in  the  IV  3  mg/kg  cohort  experienced  the  Grade  2,  related  TEAE  of  herpes 
zoster. 
In Study CT-P13 1.9, at least 1 TEAE classified as infection was reported for 9 (8.3%) subjects in the 
Remsima SC AI arm and 7 (6.6%) subjects in the CT-P13 SC PFS arm. All infections were Grade 1 or 2 
in  intensity.  The  most  commonly  reported  infection  was  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (5  [4.6%] 
subjects in the CT-P13 SC AI arm and 3 [2.8%] subjects in the CT-P13 SC PFS arm). The causality was 
in in most cases not related. 
No events of TB of other opportunistic infections were reported in healthy volunteer studies. 
Patients with RA in study CT-P13 3.5  
Part 1 
During the Maintenance Phase of Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 1, at least 1 TEAE classified as infection was 
reported for 5 (38.5%) patients in the IV 3 mg/kg cohort, 4 (36.4%) patients in the SC 90 mg cohort, 
3 (25.0%)  patients  in  the  SC  120  mg  cohort  and  6  (50.0%)  patients  in  the  SC  180  mg  cohort.  One 
patient with serious infection in each of the IV arm, SC 90 mg arm and SC 180 mg were reported; there 
were no patients with serious infection in the SC 120 mg arm. 
Part 2 
Original submission 
During  the  maintenance  phase  of  study  CT-P13  3.5  Part  2,  treatment-emergent  AEs  classified  as 
infections were reported in 66 (19.0%) patients in total (34 [20%] patients and 32 [18.0%] patients in 
SC 120 mg and IV 3 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively). The majority of TEAEs due to infections were 
grade 1 or 2 in intensity. 
The most commonly reported infection was viral upper respiratory tract infection (6 [3.4%] patients in 
the IV 3 mg/kg arm and  7 [4.1%] patients in the SC 120 mg arm), followed by latent TB (7 [3.9%] 
patients in the IV 3 mg/kg arm and 4 [2.4%] patients in the SC 120 mg arm) and upper respiratory tract 
infection (6 [3.4%] patients in the IV 3 mg/kg arm and 5 [2.9%] patients in the SC 120 mg arm).

Updated  safety  data,  excluding the  five  patients  from  the  site  where  major  scientific  misconduct  was 
reported 
With  the  updated  safety  data,  the  infections  by  incidence  and  grade  are  presented  in  Table  37.  The 
incidence  of  infections  was  29.22%  for  SC  arm  and  34.3%  in  the  IV  arm.  No  clear  differences  in  the 
severity and in relation to study medication were observed. 
The MAH has also calculated the incidence of patients with infections per 100PY Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 
2, which were 36.230 (95% CI: 25.509, 49.939) and 32.885 (95% CI: 24.971, 42.511) for the Treatment

Abbreviations: IV, intravenous; SC, subcutaneous; TEAE, treatment-emergent adverse event. 
Note: At each level of summarisation, patients were counted once if they reported 1 or more events. Only the 
most severe event was counted. The event was considered to be related if the relationship was defined as 
“Possible”, “Probable” or “Definite”. Treatment-emergent AEs occurred in maintenance phase were summarised. 
1. 
From MedDRA, Version 20.0. 
In the updated safety results up to 64 weeks, the majority of TEAEs classified as infections during the 
maintenance phase were grade 1 or 2 in intensity. Four patients (3 [1.8%] patients and 1 [0.6%] patient 
in SC 120 mg and IV 3 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively) reported TESAEs classified as infections, 
and 3 events (tracheobronchitis and pneumonia from SC 120 mg treatment arm and pertussis from IV 
3 mg/kg treatment arm) were considered related to the study drug by the investigator. 
With the updated safety data, the numbers of patients with serious or Grade 3 infections between SC 
and IV Remsima were 6 vs 1, from which 5 events in the SC arm were considered related, and 1 in SC 
and 1 in IV were considered unrelated to study medication. The Grade 3 infections for patients in the SC 
group were mainly respiratory infections (n=3; bronchitis, tracheobronchitis and pneumonia). All other 
infections were single cases only. No grade 4 or 5 infections were found. 
Patients with CD in study CT-P13 1.6 
During the Maintenance Phase of Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1, at least 1 TEAE classified as infection was 
reported for 3 (23.1%) patients in the IV 5 mg/kg cohort, 7 (63.6%) patients in the SC 120 mg cohort, 
2 (16.7%) patients in the SC 180 mg cohort and 4 (50.0%) patients in the SC 240 mg cohort. There 
was only 1 patient with a serious infection; this patient was in the SC 240 mg arm. The MAH states that 
the number of patients with infections in this study is comparable to rates in previous studies in which 
patients were treated with CT-P13 IV and with Remicade. 
Latent tuberculosis (TB) 
In tudy CT-P13 3.5 Part 1 during the Maintenance Phase, latent TB was reported for 1 (7.7%) patient in 
the IV 3 mg/kg cohort and 1 (9.1%) patient in the SC 90 mg cohort. 
In  the  original  submission,  during  the  Maintenance  Phase  of  Study  CT-P13  3.5  Part  2,  latent  TB  was 
reported for 7 (3.9%) patients in the IV 3 mg/kg arm and 4 (2.4%) patients in the SC 120 mg arm. All 
the events were Grade 1 or 2 and non-serious. Four cases in the SC arm and 5 cases in the IV arm were 
considered not related to the study medication. In most cases, study drug was interrupted due to the 
event. All patients received treatment for the event, and in 5 of the 11 cases, the patients recovered or 
were recovering. Except for one patient, none of the events led to permanent discontinuation of study 
drug. 
With the updated safety data, excluding the five patients from the site where major scientific 
misconduct as reported, in total latent tuberculosis was reported in 8 (4.8%) in the SC arm and 
10 (5.7%) in the IV arm in Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2. 
In Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1 in patients with CD, latent tuberculosis was observed in two patients in the 
Remsima 180 mg SC arm, and in one patient in 240 mg arm, whereas there were no cases in the IV or 
SC 120 mg arms. 
Active tuberculosis (TB) 
During the Maintenance Phase of Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 1, active TB (pulmonary TB) was reported for 
1 (8.3%) patient in the SC 180 mg cohort (Grade 3), 16 days after the previous dose of study drug at 
Week 32. The patient also had a medical history of latent TB. The event was considered to be probably 
related to study drug by the Investigator. The patient was permanently discontinued from study drug 
and recovered from the pulmonary TB after treatment. With the updated study data, no new cases of 
Assessment Report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/548703/2019  
Page 109/150 
 
 
 
 
active  tuberculosis  were  reported.  No  cases  of  latent  or  active  tuberculosis  were  observed  in  healthy 
volunteer studies. 
Malignancies 
In the original submission, no malignancies were reported in Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 1 and Part 2, 
neither in healthy volunteer studies.  With the updated safety data, one TEAE classified as malignancy 
were reported in 1 (0.6%) patient in SC 120 mg treatment arm (ovarian malignancy classified by the 
investigator as related) in Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2. In addition, during the Maintenance Phase of Study 
CT-P13 1.6 Part 1 in patients with CD, one case of malignant melanoma was reported for 1 patient in 
the IV 5 mg/kg cohort. The event was considered by the Investigator to be unrelated to study drug. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Serious adverse events in healthy subjects  
There were no SAEs reported in in study CT-P13 1.5. Two SAEs (1.8%) were reported for two subjects 
in Study CT-P13 1.9 (traffic accidents, not related). 
Serious Adverse events in patients with RA in Study CT-P13 3.5, Part 1 
During the Maintenance Phase of Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 1, TESAEs were reported for 1 (7.7%) patient 
in the IV 3 mg/kg cohort (urinary tract infection), 2 (18.2%) patients in the SC 90 mg cohort (latent TB 
and intervertebral disc disorder for 1 patient each), no patients in the SC 120 mg cohort and 3 (25.0%) 
patients in the  SC  180  mg  cohort  (antiphospholipid  syndrome,  pulmonary  TB  and  spinal  compression 
fracture for 1 patient each). 
TESAEs considered by the Investigator to be related to study drug were antiphospholipid syndrome and 
pulmonary TB in the SC 180 mg cohort. 
Serious Adverse events in patients with RA in Study CT-P13 3.5, Part 2 
In the original submission, during the Maintenance Phase of Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2 up to Week 30, 
TESAEs  were  reported  for  7 (3.9%)  patients  in  the IV  3  mg/kg  arm  and  3  (1.8%)  patients  in the  SC 
120 mg arm. The most commonly reported TESAE was vertigo positional (2 [0.6%] patients overall, both 
in the IV 3 mg/kg arm). All other TESAEs were reported for only 1 patient each. 
With the updated safety data, during the Maintenance Phase of Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2 up to Week 54, 
TESAEs were reported for 13 (7.3%) patients in the IV 3 mg/kg arm and 6 (3.5%) patients in the SC 
120 mg arm. The most commonly reported TESAE were cardiac disorders (n=4, all unrelated) for the IV 
group  (two  of  those  were  fatal)  and  vertigo  positional  (n=2,  both  related).    All  other  TESAEs  were 
reported for only 1 patient each (Table 38).

Serious Adverse events in patients with CD in Study CT-P13 1.6, Part 1 
During  the  maintenance  phase  of  the  dose-finding  study  CT-P13  1.6  Part  1  in  CD-patients,  at  least 
1 TESAE was reported for 4 (30.8%) patients in the IV 5 mg/kg cohort, 2 (18.2%) patients in the SC 
120 mg cohort, 1 (8.3%) patient in the SC 180 mg cohort and 3 (37.5%) patients in the SC 240 mg 
cohort. The most commonly reported TESAE was (aggravation of) Crohn’s disease, which was reported 
for  1  (7.7%)  patient  in  the  IV  5  mg/kg  cohort  and  2  (18.2%)  patients  in  the  SC  120  mg  cohort.  No 
TESAEs of ARRs or ISRs were reported. 
Deaths in CT-P13 studies 
No deaths were reported during Studies CT-P13 1.5 and CT-P13 1.9 conducted with healthy subjects or 
Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 1 conducted with RA patients. 
In the original submission, a total of 5 TEAEs leading to death were reported in the Remsima SC studies. 
There  were  3 deaths  up  to  Week  30  in  Study  CT-P13  3.5  Part  2  conducted  with  RA  patients  (sudden 
death in the IV arm, myocardial infarction on the day of administration (ARR also reported) in the IV 
arm,  and  toxic  hepatitis  and  liver  failure  due  to  hereditary  haemochromatosis  in  the  SC  arm)  and 
2 deaths (sudden cardiac death in patient in IV 5mg/kg arm and sudden death in SC 180 mg arm) in 
Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1 conducted with CD patients.

Of these 5 deaths reported in the original submission in patients who had received at least 1 dose of 
study drug in Remsima SC studies, 3 patients were in IV treatment group (two patient with RA and one 
patient with CD) and 2 patients were in SC treatment group (one with RA and one with CD). One death 
in the RA study IV arm and one in the CD study SC arm occurred on the study drug administration day. 
In addition, there was one death in study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2 that was due to acute myocardial infarction 
during the screening period before the first administration of study drug. 
With the updated data, two additional death cases were reported in Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2 in the SC 
arm after the Week 30 visit in patients who switched from IV to SC at Week 30. Thus, there were in total 
three deaths in patients receiving SC treatment, and two death in the IV treatment arm in the study CT-
P13 3.5. The MAH conducted a comprehensive investigation on all death cases, including two new cases 
reported in patients switching from CT-P13 IV to SC treatment at Week 30, and evaluated the potential 
effect of study medication on each fatal case. The causes of death were sudden death (n=2), myocardial 
infarction  (n=2),  cardiac  arrest  (n=1),  sudden  cardiac  death  (n=1)  and  hereditary  haemocromatosis 
(n=1). Please notice, that these numbers (n=7) include also the two deaths reported in the CT-P13 1.6 
study, as described above. 
There were three deaths that occurred on the CT-P13 administration day (the previously reported two 
cases, and one additional case after Week 30), but according to MAH, no relationship of the deaths to 
study medication was detected in terms of their drug serum levels and immunogenicity results. Among 
the three patients who died on the CT-P13 administration day, only one patient had positive anti-drug 
antibody  (ADA)  and  neutralising  antibody  (NAb)  at  the  latest  result  before  death.  Also,  all  of  three 
patients had lower Ctrough levels at the latest results before deaths than the mean values of the same 
treatment groups. 
Short summaries of deaths in patients treated with Remsima SC are provided below. 
Patient 1: A patient with RA, who had no previous relevant medical history, received 2 doses of Remsima 
IV and 2 doses of 120mg Remsima SC. 67 days since the last SC dose, the patient died due to hereditary 
haemochromatosis (which was diagnosed during the study). No autopsy was performed. However, the 
Investigator  confirmed  that  the  direct  causes  of  death  were  toxic  hepatitis  and  liver  failure  due  to 
hereditary hemochromatosis. The infliximab serum concentration at Week 6 pre-dose was 12 500 ng/mL. 
The event was considered by the Investigator to be unrelated to the study drug. 
As  requested,  the  MAH  has  provided  further  information  concerning  this  case in  relation to  infliximab 
concentration indicating that Based on the patient’s body weight of 80 kg, the loading doses of CT-P13 
IV 247.5 mg and 248.4 mg (3 mg/kg) were given at Week 0 and Week 2, respectively. CT-P13 SC 120 
mg was then administered subcutaneously at Week 6 and Week 8. The patient presented higher Ctrough 
level of 12.5 µg/ml (12500 ng/ml), which was measured before the administration of first SC dose at 
Week 6, compared to the mean 8.7 µg/ml (8686.8 ng/ml) and geometric mean 5.1 µg/ml (5121.8 ng/ml) 
level of patients from the same treatment arm. The CT-P13 IV loading dose based on the patient’s body 
weight (80 kg) was correctly calculated and the patient complied with dosing interval well. The patient’s 
Ctrough level was slightly high compared to the mean level of other patients in the same treatment group 
at the timepoints tested, but the patient’s Ctrough level remained in the range (0.1 - 25.2 µg/ml) which 
was not considered an outlier and not extremely high. In comparison to Study CT-P13 3.1, the patient’s 
Ctrough level (12.5 µg/ml) was similar to the mean Ctrough levels at Week 2, which were 11.97 µg/ml in the 
CT-P13 treatment group and 11.61 µg/ml in the Remicade® treatment group (CT-P13 3.1 CSR Post-text 
Table 14.2.7.1).  The MAH has also concluded that while an indirect effect of the patient’s drug serum 
concentration level on the event cannot be fully excluded, there was no convincing temporal association 
between the death and drug exposure since the death event occurred 67 days after the last dose of the 
medication. Therefore, it is unlikely that Ctrough level had a profound impact on the patient’s death.

Patient 2: patient with RA received the first CT-P13 IV treatment on Week 0 and the last dose of the 
CT-P13  SC  treatment  prior  to  TESAE  onset  on  Week  54.  The  patient  experienced  cardiac  arrest  and 
subsequently died (approximately 8 hours after the last CT-P13 SC treatment at Week 54). The patient 
had  a  relevant  medical  history  of  hypertension,  aortic  valve  stenosis,  bicuspid  aortic  valve  and  aortic 
valve  insufficiency.  Upon  the  diagnosis  of  aortic  valve  stenosis,  a  surgical  intervention  was  proposed 
from  another  hospital,  but  the  patient  refused.  It  was  later  confirmed  by  the  cardiology  report  from 
another hospital,  after her  death,  that  the  patient had  a  chest  pain  that  radiated  to  the  left  arm  and 
resolved when she took nitroglycerin. The investigator thought that the patient might have intentionally 
hid  her  cardiac  symptoms  not  to  be  discontinued  from  the  study.  The  cause  of  death  provided  was 
bicuspid  aortic  valve  congenital  and  untreated  aortic  valve  stenosis.  The  event  of  cardiac  arrest  was 
considered by the investigator to be unrelated to the study drug. 
Patient 3, a patient with RA received the first CT-P13 IV treatment on (Week 0) and the last dose of 
the  CTP13  SC  treatment  prior  to  TESAE  onset  (Week  34).  The  patient  experienced  the  symptoms  of 
chest pain and dyspnea on (12 days after the last CT-P13 SC treatment at Week 34), The ECG recording 
from the emergency room showed diaphragmatic acute ST wave elevated MI. The patient was transferred 
to  another  hospital,  where  at  the  entrance  she  lost  her  consciousness  and  had  no  spontaneous 
respiration. Although the advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation was done, she died. The patient had 
medical  history  of  hypertension  ongoing.  The  patient  had  smoked  2  packs  of  cigarette  per  day  for 
decades and was in stressful circumstances such as unemployed state and family relations, which are 
the risk factors of MI. The investigator confirmed that the death occurred because of the event of MI 
with ventricular fibrillation and diaphragmatic acute STEMI and assessed the event as unrelated to the 
study drug. 
In addition, a sudden death occurred in study CT-P1.6 Part 1 in the 180 mg SC arm: A patient with CD 
was treated with two doses of Remsima IV and 13  doses of Remsima SC 180 mg. The patient had a 
sudden death on the day of SC study drug administration. The Investigator reported that although the 
exact cause of death was unknown due to a sudden nature of the event, the possible underlying causes 
of the event would include the patient’s pre-existing medical history of cardiovascular disease, Crohn’s 
disease, diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome. The investigator reported the causal relationship of 
the event to the study drug as unrelated considering the possible underlying causes of the event. 
Additional information on cardiac events 
The MAH was requested to provide further information on serum concentration level of infliximab in all 
patients with confirmed or potential cardiac events (including cardiac deaths and sudden deaths) in the 
D120  LoQ.  The  MAH  summarized  data  from  the  CT-P13  SC  studies,  according  to  which  in  total  19 
confirmed  cardiac  events  and  potential  cardiac  events  were  reported  from  16  patients  (including  12 
events from 11 [3.2%] RA patients). Based on data presented, there was no indication of increased pre-
dose  serum  concentration,  nor  increased  AUC  and  Ctrough levels  in  those  patients  with  cardiac  events 
compared to overall patients at the same sampling week. 
Laboratory findings 
Healthy volunteers  
In study CT-P13 1.5 there were no clinically significant abnormal laboratory results. The MAH states that 
safety  laboratory  parameters  outside  the  reference  range  were  noted  for  several  subjects.  However, 
these were usually just above or below the reference range. 
For  study  CT-P13  1.9  in  healthy  subjects,  the  MAH  states  that  in  evaluation  of  haematology,  clinical 
chemistry, coagulation and urinalysis parameters, the mean changes from baseline were small and there 
were no notable differences between the treatment arms. The most commonly reported TEAEs (≥ 5%

subjects  overall)  were  blood  creatine  phosphokinase  (CPK)  increased  (20  [9.3%]  subjects  overall; 
7 [6.4%] subjects in the CT-P13 SC AI arm and 13 [12.3%] subjects in the CT-P13 SC PFS arm). 
Grade 3 or 4 CPK increased was reported for 6 subjects in the CT-P13 SC AI arm and 9 subjects in the 
CT-P13 SC PFS arm. All subjects with CPK increased recovered without treatment. The MAH performed 
analysis of these cases and summarized that the elevations were considered related to physical activity. 
Patients with RA in Study CT-P13 3.5 
In Part 1 Grade 4 hyperkalemia was reported for 1 (8.3%) patient in the SC 120 mg cohort and Grade 
3 hyperkalemia was reported for 1 (8.3%) patient in the SC 180 mg cohort. Grade 3 GGT increased was 
reported for 1 (7.7%) patient in the IV 3 mg/kg cohort and 1 (9.1%) patient in the SC 90 mg cohort. 
According to the CSR, in study CT-P13 3.5, part 2, in laboratory values (haematology, clinical chemistry, 
and urinalysis laboratory parameters) there were generally no notable differences in the mean change 
from baseline in the two treatment arms. The majority of patients had laboratory results of no CTCAE 
grade or CTCAE grade 1 (mild) during the study. 
In the initial submission in Study CT-P13 3.5 laboratory results showed numerically more events of Grade 
3 or 4 liver enzyme elevations in Remsima SC arm (5 events in 3 patients) than the CT-P13 IV 3 mg/kg 
arm  (1  event  in  1  patient)  for  the  data  up  to  Week  30  after  beginning  of  maintenance  treatment  at 
Week 6. 
For  the  updated  safety  data  up  to  Week  54,  Grade  3  or  4  liver  enzyme  elevation  was  reported  for 
2 (1.1%) patients (2 events) and 4 (2.4%) patients (6 events) in the CT-P13 IV 3 mg/kg and SC 120 mg 
arms, respectively. However, the increases in liver enzymes were observed in a small number of patients 
and were transient in nature and none of these cases fulfilled laboratory and clinical criteria for drug-
induced liver injury. 
Single  cases  of  other  laboratory  finding,  e.g.,  hyponatremia  and  hyperkalemia  were  reported  in  both 
arms.  Grade  3  neutropenia  were  reported  in  both  arms  at  a  relatively  low  incidence,  and  Grade  4 
neutrophil count decreased was reported for 1 patient in each treatment arm. With the updated data no 
new safety concerns were observed. 
Patients with CD in Study CT-P13 1.6 
In study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1, single cases of different post-baseline CTCAE Grade 3 and Grade 4 laboratory 
results  were  found  in  all  treatment  arms  and  included  Blood  bilirubin  increased,  CPK  increased,  GGT 
increased, Anaemia, Lymphocyte count decreased, and Neutrophil count decreased. 
In  conclusion,  in  healthy  volunteer  study  CT-P13  1.9,  there  were  relatively  high  numbers  of  CPK 
increases overall, and also in Grade 3 and 4 CPK events.  In study CT-P13 3.5, even though the numbers 
are small, there were numerically more Grade 3 or 4 liver enzyme elevations in the SC arm (5  vs. 1 
events). 
Vital Signs, ECG. Physical Findings and Local Site Pain 
In  the  studies  with  healthy  subjects,  commonly  reported  clinically  notable  vital  sign  were  abnormal 
respiratory  rates  (both  low  and  high).  No  individual  abnormal  ECG  value  was  considered  clinically 
significant or reported as a TEAE by the Investigator. 
In study CT-P13 3.5 Part 1, the mean changes from baseline in vital sign values were according to the 
MAH small, and there were no notable differences among the cohorts at any time point. 
In study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2, according to the CSR, in general, mean changes from baseline of vital sign 
measurements were small, and there were no notable differences between the treatment arms at any 
Assessment Report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation

time point. All patients who had ECG results were reported to have had normal or abnormal not clinically 
significant ECG results at baseline and all scheduled visits except for 1 (0.6%) patient. With the updated 
data,  all  patients  who  had  ECG  results,  had  normal  or  abnormal  not  clinically  significant  ECG  results 
during the treatment period except for 2 (1.1%) patients in IV 3 mg/kg treatment arm. 
In Study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1, according to the MAH, mean changes from baseline in vital sign values were 
small, and there were no consistent notable differences among the cohort’s post-baseline. 
Physical Findings 
According to the MAH, in all studies, there were no notable findings with regards to physical examination 
at baseline or during the study. 
Local Site Pain Assessment: Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) 
Local pain assessments using VAS were also conducted in the two dose-finding studies and the pivotal 
RA study without any notable findings. 
Safety in special populations 
As stated above, in order not to omit any relevant data on recorded adverse events, listings of adverse 
events are mostly presented here with the patients from the site where major scientific misconduct was 
reported included.  
The incidence of serious infections in infliximab-treated patients 65 years and older has been reported 
to be greater than those under 65 years of age (Remsima SmPC, 2018). 
The  MAH  analysed  the  incidence  of  infections  by  age  group  in  CT-P13  IV  study  with  RA  patients  and 
stated that in Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2 up to Week 30, TEAEs in the SOC infections and infestations were 
reported for a lower proportion of patients in the ≥ 18 years to ≤ 64 years subgroup (19.2% [n=151]) 
compared with the ≥ 65 years subgroup (26.3% [n=19]) for the CT-P13 SC treatment arm. The same 
trend was not observed for the Remsima IV treatment arm (20.7% [n=150] and 3.6% [n=28] in the ≥ 
18 years to ≤ 64 years and ≥ 65 years subgroups, respectively). 
However,  the  MAH  acknowledged  that  the  data  should  be  interpreted  with  caution  as  the  number  of 
patients in each subgroup is small and Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2 is an ongoing study. No other important 
reported intrinsic factors are considered by the MAH to influence the safety of infliximab. 
The MAH has concluded that besides age, no other important reported intrinsic factors are considered to 
influence the safety of infliximab. 
The MAH has provided a summary AE table including more mature safety data (up to 54 weeks) by age 
groups <65 years and ≥ 65 (up to 75 years which was the upper limit for inclusion in the study). Only a 
small subgroup of patients were ≥ 65 years of age (19 patients in the SC 120 mg arm and 28 patients 
in the IV 3 mg/kg arm). There were no obvious trends in relation to safety observations. However, as 
the number of patients over 65 years is very limited, no conclusions can be drawn. 
The  data  from  the  subgroup  analyses  are  presented  in  Table  40  and  Table  41  below.  There  was  no 
particular trend observed for each category that would indicate an increase in risk of adverse events in 
older patients  treated  with  Remsima  IV  or  SC.  Change  in  quality  of  life  was  also  calculated  based on 
short form (36) (SF-36) healthy survey. In general, patients < 65 years old showed higher scores than 
patients ≥ 65 years old, but it was expected for older patients to score lower on the SF-36 survey. By 
Week 54, the mean score of each component of the survey was increased for younger and older patients 
in both treatment arms. An additional analysis of safety data by age from CT-P13 3.5 clinical trial showed 
a trend for increased treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in those > 65 years of age.

IV: Intravenous, SC: Subcutaneous, TESAE: Treatment-emergent serious adverse event 
There were no confirmed cases of pregnancy in Studies CT-P13 1.5, CT-P13 1.9, CT-P13 3.5 Part 1 or 
CT-P13 1.9. In Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2, one pregnancy was reported; a patient was found to be pregnant 
at the Week 30 visit on 26 June 2018 by urine pregnancy test. Study drug was discontinued due to the 
event.  During  the  follow-up,  it  was  confirmed  that  the  patient  gave  birth  at  39  weeks  gestation  to  a 
healthy female child, by caesarean section without incident. 
Immunological events 
The infliximab in Remsima IV and SC preparations is manufactured under similar conditions and the only 
differences in composition of the products is the addition of acetic acid, sodium acetate trihydrate and 
sorbitol to the SC formulation. None of these excipients have been described as being associated with 
an impact on the immunogenicity of a therapeutic protein in humans.

The  comparison  of  the  immunogenicity  profiles  of  Remsima  IV  and  SC  are  based  on  two  single  dose 
studies in healthy subjects (CT-P13 1.5. and CT-P13 1.9.) and two multiple dose studies in RA and CD 
patients (CT-P13 3.5. and CT-P13 1.6.). The studies are described in detail in other sections. 
Sampling 
In study CT-P13 1.5 (single dose), samples were analysed at days 0, 56 and 84 and in study CT-P13 1.9 
(single  dose)  at  days  0,  28,  42,  56  and  84.  In  study  CT-P13  3.5  Part  1  and  Part  2  (multiple  dose), 
samples were analysed at weeks 0, 6, 14, 22, 30,  38, 46 and 54, and in study CT-P13 1.6 part 1 at 
weeks 0, 6, 14, 22, 30, 38, 46 and 54. 
Results 
Frequency of ADA and NAb 
In study CT-P13 1.5 (healthy individuals, single dose), ADA levels were overall comparable between the 
SC and IV groups (70-100% at the end of study visit), with no clear differences between the timing of 
ADA-positivity, titers, or NAb frequencies. However, numerically these frequencies were slightly higher, 
in the SC 120 mg group (proposed SC dose for RA) compared to the IV group (3mg/kg, used in RA), i.e. 
100% ADA-positive patients at EOS with 50% Nabs in the SC group compared to 70% and 14% in the 
IV group. 
In study CT-P13 1.9 (healthy individuals, single dose), ADA levels were comparable in the autoinjector 
vs.  pre-filled  syringe  groups  (93.6%  vs.  90.6%  at  the  end  of  study  visit),  with  no  clear  differences 
between the timing of ADA-positivity, titers, or Nab frequencies. 
In study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1, a similar tendency was observed, with slightly lower ADA levels in SC groups 
compared to IV (18.2-37.5% vs 61.5%, respectively, at the end of study visit), with no clear differences 
between the timing of ADA-positivity, titers, or NAb frequencies. 
In study CT-P13 3.5 part 1 (RA patients, multiple dose) there was a tendency for lower ADA frequency 
at  the  end  of  study  in  the  groups  that  received  Remsima  SC  compared  to  the  group  that  received 
Remsima  IV  (50-81.8%  vs.  84.6%),  with  no  clear  differences  between  the  timing  of  ADA-positivity, 
titers, or Nab frequencies. 
In the pivotal study (CT-P13 3.5 part 2; RA patients, multiple dose), the frequency of ADA-positivity post 
treatment  up  to  week  54  was  lower  in  the  SC  vs.  IV  group  49.4  vs.  72.0%,  respectively).  No  clear 
differences between the timing of ADA-positivity, or Nab frequencies were observed. After switching to 
the SC formulation at Week 30 the proportion of patients who had positive ADA results in the CT-P13 IV 
arm reduced from 61.1% at week 30 to 36.6% at week 54 The MAH states that the detected difference 
in ADA levels among the same patients while on IV dosing compared to SC dosing is likely due to the 
higher Ctrough levels after switching, which suggests that some low-titre ADAs in patients receiving CT-
P13 SC have not been detected. This is probably due to drug interference of the assay; observed Ctrough 
at Week 36 after switching was 8.79 μg/mL and 12.20 μg/mL in the CT-P13 IV and CT-P13 SC arms, 
respectively compared to Week 22 pre-switch levels of 1.03 μg/mL and 13.19 μg/mL, respectively. 
In the IV arm 65 subjects (37.0%) were classified as NAb-positive at week 30 and 43 subjects (24.6%) 
at week 54. The MAH has provided an estimate of the number of patients with a possible false negative 
NAb result. Taking into consideration the drug tolerance level and drug serum concentration when the 
samples were taken, 15 (6.8%) patients had at least one potential false negative NAb sample due to a 
serum CT-P13 level over 10 μg/mL.

Titres 
In the pivotal study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2 the ADA titres seemed to be considerably higher in the SC group 
(

Table 42). At week 30 the frequency of moderate and high titres (thought to be clinically significant) of 
ADAs seemed comparable between the two treatment arms, even though the frequency of low titres was 
lower in the SC arm. At the end of week 54 the titres were similar in both treatment arms even if the 
titres remained marginally lower in the patients initially treated with IV Remsima. Because of the very 
different drug levels influencing the ADA assay, comparing titre levels between the treatment arms is 
not completely reliable.

Effect of ADA on PK 
Only assessment of the pivotal study is presented here. Results from studies CT-P13 1.6 Part 1 and CT-
P13 3.5 Part 1 were in line with the results from the pivotal study. 
In study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2 ADA presence in serum resulted in an overall decrease of drug exposure. The 
PK parameters tend to be lower in post-treatment ADA positive subgroup, and both IV 3 mg/kg and SC 
120 mg arms show a similar trend Figure 23 and Table 43. 
In Figure 23 a patient was classified as ADA positive if he/she had at least one ADA positive test result 
at  any  time.  This  classification  is  not  optimal  for  determination  of  impact  of  ADA  presence  on  drug 
concentration. Table 43 shows Ctrough concentrations by visit-based ADA status.

Table 43 shows that mean Ctrough drug concentrations remained around the level of 3 μg/mL among ADA 
negative  subjects  in  the  IV  treatment  arm.  Among  ADA  positive  subjects  treated  with  IV,  Ctrough 
concentrations were mostly well below 1 μg/mL. In the SC treatment arm the presence of ADA in serum

also resulted in a clear decrease in drug levels but mean drug levels in ADA-positive patients treated 
with SC were still consistently above 1 μg/mL in both treatment arms. 
To evaluate the impact of ADA titre on PK, pre-dose concentrations were assessed by visit-based ADA 
titre quartile. All patients who had 'Positive' ADA status result at each visit were included in this analysis 
and categorised into the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th quartiles using the 25th, 50th, 75th percentiles of ADA titre 
result, respectively, at each visit in the Pharmacokinetic Population. The  quartile division in ADA titre at 
each visit is summarised in Table 44. 
The subgroup analysis showed that there was a trend for pre-dose concentration to decrease as ADA 
titre  increases  for  both  treatment  arms  (Table  45).  In  the  IV  arm  ADA  titres  as  low  as  ≤  92  were 
accompanied by mean drug levels below 1 μg/mL, whereas in the SC group, drug levels remained on 
average above 1 μg/mL as long as ADA titres were < 736. At the highest titres the mean pre-dose drug 
concentrations were below the lower limit of quantitation (BLQ, < 0.1 µ g/mL) for both treatment arms.

Effect of ADA on efficacy and safety 
There was a statistically and clinically non-significant tendency for weaker DAS28 and ACR 
improvement in ADA-positive RA patients compared to ADA-negative patients. This effect was similar 
between the SC and IV groups. (Figure 24 and Table 46).

At  week  30,  ADA  positive  patients  in  the  SC  arm  had  significantly  higher  response  levels  than  ADA 
positive patients in the IV arm and numerically even slightly better response than ADA negative patients 
in the IV arm (Table 46). This is in line with the effects of ADA presence on drug concentrations shown 
above in Table 43.

Infections 
With results from Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2 up to Week 54, the impact of ADA positivity on the incidence 
of  infection  and  different  types  of  infections  (pneumonia,  latent  tuberculosis  [TB]  and  opportunistic 
infection) were assessed as presented in  Table 47. There was no significant difference in the incidence 
of  each  infection  between  the  post-treatment  ADA  subsets,  with  the  exception  of  other  opportunistic 
infections  in  the  CT-P13  SC  arm  which  showed  a  slightly  higher  incidence  in  the  post-treatment  ADA 
negative subset than ADA positive subset (4 [4.4%] patients and 0, respectively). However, all reported 
opportunistic infections were mild or moderate oral herpes, and the events were recovered within few 
days. 
The percentages of latent tuberculosis were almost double in ADA positive arms (6.3% vs. 3.9% in the 
IV arm and 6.3% vs. 3.3% in the SC arm) but the treatment arms were similar compared to each other. 
Overall,  the  incidence  of  infection  and  different  types  of  infections  are  well  balanced  between  post-
treatment ADA positive and post-treatment ADA negative subsets in CT-P13 IV and CT-P13 SC arms.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug-drug interactions 
No formal PK interaction studies have been performed with Remsima SC. 
MAH has indicated that it is expected that the PK interactions of Remsima SC will be similar to Remsima 
IV. According to the Remicade EPAR (2005), in an interaction study with methotrexate (MTX), the plasma 
concentration of infliximab was slightly increased by MTX. With Remicade, lower frequencies of patients 
with antibodies to infliximab were also observed during MTX co-treatment. 
Modelling of PK and safety parameters 
To  investigate  the  relationship  between  the  safety  profile  of  infliximab  and  exposure  to  infliximab, 
multiple  logistic  regression  analyses  for  TEAE,  TESAE,  infections  and  ARR  were  performed  with 
Assessment Report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation

covariates, AUC, body weight, treatment arm and all possible interactions for Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2. 
AUCτ was taken as the mean of the computed AUC values from Week 22 to Week 30. 
Infusion-related reactions 
The relationship between infliximab steady state exposure parameters (AUCτ (normalised to Q8W dosing 
frequency),  Cmax,  Ctrough)  and  reported  AEs  of  special  interest  (infusion-related  reactions  (IRR)  and 
infections) was explored. Individual exposure parameters were estimated using the population PK model. 
In all patients, for both the IV and SC regimens, boxplots indicate no difference in steady state AUCτ and 
Ctrough between the group of individuals who experienced IRR and those who did not. 
In some patient groups subjects who experienced IRR tended to have lower infliximab exposure than 
those who did not, but the results should be interpreted with caution given the small number of patients. 
Boxplots of Cmax vs. AEs were generally comparable to those for AUCτ vs. AEs. 
Infections  
The  results  concerning  infections  indicate  that  exposures  between  patients  that  experienced  infection 
was comparable to that of patients without infections with the only exception being the CD SC group, 
which appears to present lower exposures for those patients that had infection. The number of CD SC 
patients that had any infection was, however, small (n=8), and only one CD SC patient had ‘Related, 
Moderate/Severe’ infection. Boxplots of Cmax vs. AEs were generally comparable to those for AUCτ vs. 
AEs. 
Discontinuation due to AEs 
No subjects permanently discontinued from healthy volunteer studies due to AEs. 
During the Maintenance Phase of Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 1, TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation 
from study drug were reported for no patients in the IV 3 mg/kg cohort, 2 (18.2%) in the 90 mg SC 
cohort and 2 (16.7%) in the 120 mg SC cohort and 2 (16.7%) in the SC 180 mg cohort. For the SC 
group  the  most  commonly  reported  TEAE  leading  to  permanent  discontinuation  from  study  drug  was 
ARR (1 patient (9.1%) in the SC 90 mg cohort and 2 patients (16.7%) in the SC 120 mg cohort). TEAEs 
leading to permanent discontinuation that were considered by the Investigator to be related to study 
drug were Grade 3 antiphospholipid syndrome and Grade 3 pulmonary TB, one patient each in the SC 
180 mg cohort). 
In Part 2 of the study, all 362 enrolled patients received CT-P13 IV in the Dose-loading Phase. Fourteen 
patients discontinued in the Dose-loading Phase; the most common primary reason for discontinuation 
was AE. 
During  the  Maintenance  Phase  of  Study  CT-P13  3.5  Part  2  up  to  week  30,  after  randomisation, 
discontinuations due to an adverse event were more common in the IV group: only 1 (0.6%) patient in 
SC 120 mg treatment arm compared to 9 (5.1%) patients in IV 3 mg/kg treatment arm discontinued 
during the maintenance phase of the pivotal study. There seems to be a higher dropout rate in the IV 
group  towards  the  later  stages  of  the  study.  TEAEs  leading  to  permanent  discontinuation  from  study 
drug in the IV 3 mg/kg arm that were considered by the Investigator to be related to study drug were 
Grade 3 vertigo positional (2 patients), Grade 2 bronchitis (1 patient), Grade 2 latent TB (1 patient), 
Grade 2 ARR (3 patients) and Grade 3 ARR (1 patient). One patient in the SC 120 mg arm permanently 
discontinued from study drug due to the Grade 3, unrelated TESAE of duodenal ulcer haemorrhage; the 
patient recovered after receiving treatment for the event. 
During the Maintenance Phase of the dose-finding study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1, at least 1 TEAE leading to 
permanent  discontinuation  from  study  drug  was  reported  for  3  (23.1%)  patients  in  the  IV  5  mg/kg 
cohort,  1  (9.1%) patient  in  the  SC  120  mg  cohort, 2  (16.7%)  patients  in the  SC  180  mg  cohort  and

1 (12.5%) patient in the SC 240 mg cohort . No TEAE by PT leading to permanent discontinuation from 
study drug was reported for > 1 patient overall. 
The  MAH  provided  data  on  extended  follow-up  in  patients  with  RA.  A  total  of  52  (14.9%)  patients 
discontinued the maintenance phase up to end of study (up to Week 54 for Bulgaria, Korea, Poland, and 
Russia)  (22  [13.0%]  patients  and  30  [16.8%]  patients  in  the  SC  120  mg  and  IV  3  mg/kg  treatment 
arms, respectively). The proportion of patients who discontinued the maintenance phase up to end of 
study  (up  to  Week  54  for  Bulgaria,  Korea,  Poland,  and  Russia)  was  generally  similar  between  two 
treatment arms. 
Post marketing experience 
Remsima SC has not yet been authorised for marketing in any country worldwide. 
Remsima IV was developed as an infliximab biosimilar and was approved by the EMA in September 2013. 
The  5-year  renewal  application  for  marketing  authorisation  submitted  to  the  EMA  in  November  2017 
included  post-marketing  data  up 
to  a  data 
lock  point 
(DLP)  of  10  August  2017 
EMEA/H/C/002576/R/0047). 
A total of 13,283 ADRs were reported during the renewal period (period from the initial approval date of 
Remsima  to  the  DLP  of  the  5-year  renewal  application)  from  post-marketing  data  sources,  including 
5,759  serious  ADRs.  ADRs  were  most  commonly  reported  for  the  SOC  general  disorders  and 
administration site conditions (2455 ADRs) followed by the SOC skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
(1504 ADRs). 
Further post-marketing exposure to Remsima IV is estimated at 370,108 patient-years up to 20 January 
2018.  There  have  been  no  safety-related  significant  changes  made  to  the  Remsima  SmPC  based  on 
Remsima clinical data. 
Human factor studies 
The MAH provided the full human factor study (HFS) reports. The MAH conducted human factor studies 
to assess the safety and usability of the devices. Overall, the conducted HF studies provided evidence 
that  the  devices  to  be  registered  for  delivery  of  Remsima  SC  are  safe  and  usable  in  the  intended 
environment. 
2.8.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Summary of the clinical database 
Intravenous infliximab has been widely used in clinical practice in EU since 1999 and its safety profile 
has been characterized by more than 15 years of clinical use. Remsima was initially developed for IV 
infusion and was approved in the EU in September 2013 (EMEA/H/C/002576) as a biosimilar product to 
EU-approved Remicade. The estimated use of Remsima is 370,108 patient-years up to 20 January 2018. 
Even though the safety profile of intravenous administration of infliximab is well established with long-
term safety data, the safety profile of SC administration of infliximab is not known, as the SC formulation 
of infliximab has not been previously authorised. 
The  originally  submitted  safety  dossier  for  this  extension  of  indication  for  Remsima  SC  consisted  of 
4 randomised controlled clinical trials, two performed in healthy volunteers, one ongoing pivotal study 
in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and one ongoing study in Crohn´s disease (CD)/colitis ulcerosa 
(CU). 
The overall safety population consists of 693 subjects: 396 patients with RA, 44 patients with CD and 
253 healthy subjects. Of these, 633 subjects (367 RA patients, 31 CD patients and 235 healthy subjects) 
Assessment Report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/548703/2019  
Page 129/150 
 
 
 
received at least 1 dose of Remsima SC, including 162 RA patients who switched to CT-P13 SC at Week 
30 in Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2. 
The originally submitted 54 week safety data in RA was based on only 44 patients from the study CT-
P13 3.5 Part 1, of whom 26 patients completed the one year treatment in this dose-finding part of the 
study (with SC doses 90 mg, 120 mg and 180 mg).  In addition, 30-week safety data from about 160 RA 
patients, treated with the 120 mg SC dose was available from Part 2 of the study. Supportive safety data 
from patients with CD up to 54 weeks was available from only 22 patients from the dose-finding part of 
the study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1 (with SC doses 120 mg, 180 mg and 240 mg). 
Based on the original submission, the amount of long-term safety and efficacy data was considered very 
limited. The need for more data was also underlined in previous CHMP Advice. During the review process, 
the MAH has provided data on extended follow-up in patients with RA from Study CT-P13 3.5. In total, 
out of 348 patients included in the study, 297 (85.3%) patients completed the maintenance phase up to 
week 54 (148 [42.5%] patients and 149 [42.8%] patients in the SC 120 mg and IV 3 mg/kg treatment 
arms, respectively). Further, according to data provided in the CSR, there were 171 (49.1%) patients 
who were continuing the study at Week 54, 86 patients in SC 120 mg and 85 patients in the original IV 
3 mg/kg  treatment  arms,  respectively).  A  total  of  52  (14.9%)  patients  discontinued  the  maintenance 
phase  up  to  end  of  study  (22 [13.0%]  patients  and  30  [16.8%]  patients  in  the  SC  120  mg  and  IV 
3 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively). In Part 2 of Study CT-P13 3.5 148 RA patients received 120 mg 
of CT-P13 SC for 54 weeks and 81 of these patients were treated for 64 weeks. 
The long-term safety database in patients with RA has thus been extended, as requested. However, the 
numbers are still limited to identify potential rare and severe adverse events. More safety data will be 
obtained from the planned post-approval safety/ PV program as described in the RMP. 
Summary of adverse events  
In studies with healthy volunteers, the numbers of subjects with at least one TEAE appeared comparable 
for the SC arms and the IV arm although the comparison is hampered by the small number of subjects 
(especially  in  healthy  volunteers  with  IV  dosing).  ISRs  occurred  only  among  healthy  subjects  that 
received the drug SC. 
In original submission in the pivotal study in RA, 263 TEAEs were reported in 138 (39.7%) patients up 
to Week 30 of maintenance phase with a similar proportion of patients who experienced TEAEs between 
the 2 treatment arms. The most frequently reported TEAEs in all patients were injection site reaction 
(ISR)  followed  by  viral  upper  respiratory  tract  infection.  The  majority  of  TEAEs  were  grade  1  or  2  in 
intensity. All of TEAEs classified as ISRs were grade 1 or 2 in intensity. Only few TESAEs were reported 
and the pattern was consistent with the known safety profile of infliximab IV administration. Overall, the 
analysis  of  the  different types  of  AEs  reported in  the  pivotal  RA  study  did  not  reveal  any  unexpected 
findings. 
The updated safety analyses confirm the earlier findings. In the safety analysis with data up to 54 weeks, 
no new safety concerns with regard to incidence and severity of TEAEs or TESAEs were observed. TEAEs 
and TESAEs were relatively evenly distributed between the SC and IV treatment arms, and their patterns 
were consistent with the known safety profile of infliximab with the exception of the local injection site 
reactions. 
There were no clearly consistent differences between Remsima IV and SC treatment groups in TEAEs 
leading  to  discontinuations  in  the  studies,  nor  between  the  Remsima  AI  and  PFS  treatment  arms. 
However,  with  the  updated  safety  data,  the  treatment-emergent  AEs  leading  to  permanent 
discontinuation  of  study  drug  during  the  treatment period  were  reported  for  5  (2.9%)  patients  in  SC 
120 mg treatment arm and 14 (7.9%) patients in IV 3 mg/kg treatment arm. Treatment-emergent AEs 
classified  as  ARR  during  the  treatment  period  were  reported  for  2  (1.2%)  patients  in  SC  120  mg

treatment  arm  and  10  (5.7%)  patients  in  IV  3  mg/kg  treatment  arm.  This  higher  incidence  of 
discontinuations in the IV arm may have minor influence on the overall results. 
Overall, the safety profile of Remsima SC in the proposed dose range do not appear consistently worse 
than Remsima IV when analysing the number of patients that reported adverse events or the type of 
events recorded. There are no clear differences between the pattern of events in the SC arms compared 
to the pattern in the IV arms (or compared to the known safety-profile of the substance) with one notable 
exception: the proportion of patients that reported a TEAE classified as an ISR, often described as an 
erythema, was generally higher in the SC group. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
In healthy volunteer studies there were no TESAEs that can possibly be considered related to the study 
drug, and there were no deaths. 
During the maintenance phase of the dose-finding Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 1 in RA patients, TESAEs were 
reported for 1 (7.7%) patient in the IV 3 mg/kg cohort, 2 (18.2%) patients in the SC 90 mg cohort, no 
patients in the SC 120 mg cohort and 3 (25.0%) patients in the SC 180 mg cohort. No TESAEs of ARRs 
or ISRs were reported. 
During the maintenance phase of the pivotal Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2 with the updated safety data up 
to 54 weeks including the five patients from the site where major scientific misconduct was reported, 
there  were  13  (7.3%)  patients  in  the  IV  arm  and  6  (3.5%)  patients  in  the  SC  arm  with  at  least  one 
TESAEs.  The  TESAEs  included  3  (1.8%)  and  1  (0.6%)  cases  of  infections  for  the  SC  and  IV  arms, 
respectively, 4 cardiac events (2.2%), all in the IV arm, and five deaths cases (see discussion below). 
The  other  TESAEs  were  mainly  single  cases  each.  The  majority  of  TESAEs  were  grade  3  or  lower  in 
intensity. 
During the maintenance phase of the dose-finding study CT-P13 1.6 Part 1 in patients with CD, at least 
1 TESAE was reported for 4 (30.8%) patients in the IV 5 mg/kg cohort, 2 (18.2%) patients in the SC 
120 mg cohort, 1 (8.3%) patient in the SC 180 mg cohort and 3 (37.5%) patients in the SC 240 mg 
cohort. No TESAEs of ARRs or ISRs were reported. A total of 7 TEAEs leading to death have been reported 
in the Remsima SC studies in patients included in this application; 3 patients treated with IV only and 4 
patients treated with SC. In study CT-P13 3.5 there were two cases of death in the Remsima IV group 
(sudden  death  and  myocardial  infarction)  and  three  in  those  patients  who  received  Remsima  SC 
(hereditary haemochromatosis, myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest). There were three deaths that 
occurred on the Remsima administration day (myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest and sudden death). 
All the death cases were considered by the investigator not related to the study medication. 
The MAH has presented data that there was no trend in regard to the pharmacokinetic parameters of 
serum drug levels and immunogenicity results in patient in the SC group (hereditary hemochromatosis) 
in who the Ctrough concentrate was considered originally high. The MAH also summarized that the numbers 
of  deaths  were  balanced  between  the  treatment  groups;  3/204  (1.47%)  in  Remsima  IV  and  4/399 
(1.00%) in patients with at least one Remsima SC dose (these numbers include two death cases in CD 
patients). No autopsy was performed for any of the death cases and no more information concerning 
these patients can be retrieved. Based on analysis provided by the MAH, the incidence rate of death in 
Remsima SC clinical trials falls within the variation reported from historical studies. 
In conclusion, with regards to serious adverse events and deaths, the safety profile of Remsima SC in 
the proposed dose range did not appear worse than Remsima IV. There were no serious events reported 
as ISRs or  ARRs in  the Remsima  SC groups.  Even though the MAH  has now  provided updated  safety 
data, the numbers of patients with up to 1-year treatment are still limited and do not allow identification 
of all rare and serious AEs, which need to be followed-up in the planned post- marketing safety study as 
detailed in the RMP.

Adverse events of special interest 
AEs of special interest included administration related reactions (ARR), infections (including opportunistic 
infections)  and  malignancies.  In  the  original  submission,  no  major  differences  were  observed  in  the 
safety  between  Remsima  IV  and  SC,  except  for  infusion-related  reactions  (IRR)  and  injection  site 
reactions (ISR) (all grade 1-2 in intensity). In the pivotal RA study with follow-up up to 30 weeks, ISRs 
were  reported  with  higher  proportion  in  the  SC  120  mg  treatment  arm  compared  to  the  IV  3  mg/kg 
treatment arm (11 [6.5%] and 4 [2.2%], whereas the occurrence of systemic IRR, associated with the 
IV route was lower in the SC route group). ARRs were reported in 1 patient [0.6%] in the SC arm and 
in 8 [4.5%] patients in the IV arm during Part 2 of the RA study. Delayed hypersensitivity (ARRs that 
occurred after 24 hours from the study drug administration) was reported for 1 (0.6%) patient in SC 
arm only, with no signs of serum sickness. However, based on modelling of all safety data, the occurrence 
of  IRR  >  24  hours  after  SC  administration  was  more  common  in  the  Remsima  SC  arm  (4  patients 
including both Part 1 and 2). The potential reasons for higher numbers of IRR were not explained in the 
submitted data. 
Further, across all clinical studies and data presented, the differences of AEs classified as ARR or IRR 
and hypersensitivity reactions were to some extent unclear, and more clarification was requested, along 
with the need to update the draft SmPC. 
The MAH has now revised the terminology concerning IRR to make these distinctions clearer. Specifically, 
ARR was revised to infusion related reactions (IRR) and systemic injection reaction (SIR) for Remsima 
IV  and  Remsima  SC  arms,  respectively,  to  distinguish  systemic  reactions  as  per  the  route  of 
administration.  ISR  was  revised  to  localised  ISR  to  specify  that  these  reactions  occurred  around  the 
injection site only, and to differentiate from systemic reactions (IRR and SIR). IRR or SIR that occurred 
after 24 hours from study drug administration were maintained as “delayed hypersensitivity”. All delayed 
hypersensitivity cases were examined to determine if these cases were serum sickness or not. 
Based  on  these  new  classifications,  the  MAH  has  performed  updated  analysis  with  more  mature  data 
from  Study  CT-P13  3.5.  TEAEs  classified  as  IRR  during  the  maintenance  phase  were  reported  for  no 
patient in SC 120 mg treatment arm and 7 (4.0%) patients in IV 3 mg/kg treatment arm. Treatment-
emergent AEs classified as SIR during the maintenance phase were reported for 2 (1.2%) patients in SC 
120 mg treatment arm and 3 (1.7%) patients in IV 3 mg/kg treatment arm. 
Treatment-emergent  AEs  classified  as  delayed  hypersensitivity  during  the  maintenance  phase  were 
reported for 4 (2.4%) patients in SC 120 mg treatment arm and no patient in IV 3 mg/kg treatment 
arm. Treatment-emergent AEs classified as localised ISR during the maintenance phase were reported 
for 30 (17.9%) patients in SC 120 mg treatment arm and 22 (12.6%) patients in IV 3 mg/kg treatment 
arm. This terminology is considered appropriate and this has now been applied also in the SmPC. 
There were no obvious differences in the incidence of infections and the types of infections between the 
study  arms.  With  the  extended  follow-up,  the  incidence  of  patients  with  infections  during  the 
maintenance  phase  was  49  (29.2%)  in  the  SC  arm  and  60  (34.3%)  in  the  IV  arm.  The  majority  of 
infections  were  of  grade  1  or  2  in  intensity.  The  most  commonly  reported  infection  was  viral  upper 
respiratory tract infection (10 patients in each group). The incidence of latent tuberculosis was 10 (5.7%) 
patients  in  the  IV  arm  and  8  (4.8%)  patients  in  the  SC  arm.  No  clear  differences  in  opportunistic 
infections  between  the  study  arms  (or  other  safety  signals)  were  observed.  Overall,  the  incidence  of 
infections and different types of infections were comparable with the historical controls. 
Only one case of malignancy (ovarian cancer) was reported in the Remsima SC arm (considered related). 
As per request, the MAH has provided additional data on serum concentration level of infliximab and the 
confirmed cardiac events and all potential cardiac events (including cardiac deaths and sudden deaths). 
Based  on  data  presented,  there  was  no  indication  of  increased  pre-dose  serum  concentration,  nor 
Assessment Report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/548703/2019  
Page 132/150 
 
 
 
increased AUC and Ctrough levels in those patients with cardiac events compared to overall patients at the 
same sampling week. 
Laboratory values 
In healthy volunteer study CT-P13 1.9 there were relatively high numbers of CPK increases: 20 subjects 
(9.3%) overall; 6.4% subjects in the AI arm and 12.3% subjects in the PFS arm, of which 15 were Grade 
3 or 4 CPK increases. The MAH has now clarified that the events of blood CPK increases in Study CT-P13 
1.9 for healthy volunteers are considered unrelated to SC infliximab and likely be caused by increased 
physical  activity,  and  this  has  also  been  confirmed  by  the  Investigator.  In  addition,  the  MAH  has 
confirmed  that  in  studies  where  patients  were  administered  with  multiple  doses  of  Remsima  SC,  the 
incidence rate of TEAE of blood CPK increased was very low and the rate of Grade 3 and 4 TEAE of blood 
CPK increased was less than 1%. 
In the original submission there were more Grade 3 or 4 liver enzyme elevations in the SC arm compared 
to IV arm. With the updated safety data, laboratory results showed numerically more Grade 3 or 4 liver 
enzyme elevation, which were reported for 2 (1.1%) patients (2 events) and 4 (2.4%) patients (6 events) 
in  the  CT-P13  IV  and  SC  arms,  respectively.  However,  the  incidence  of  liver  enzyme  elevations  was 
balanced between the 2 treatment arms, taking into account the events which occurred during the Dose-
Loading  Phase  (Week  0  to  Week  6):  4  (2.2%)  and  4  (2.4%)  patients.  In  total,  the  increases  in  liver 
enzymes were observed in a small number of patients and were transient in nature and none of these 
cases fulfilled laboratory and clinical criteria for drug-induced liver injury (DILI). 
Otherwise no major findings, nor differences between the study arms were seen in laboratory values. 
However, limited database does not allow conclusions concerning laboratory values. 
Correlation between PK and AEs 
Based on historical studies and on post hoc analyses conducted in IV and SC studies, increased infliximab 
serum concentrations did not appear to increase safety risks. However, the numbers of SC patients are 
small and therefore no conclusions can be made. 
Exploratory graphical analyses indicated that subjects who experienced infusion related reactions (IRR) 
and  infections  did  not  have  higher  exposure  to  infliximab.  Patients  that  had  moderate  to  severe  IRR 
tended to have lower exposure to infliximab, but this finding should be interpreted with caution because 
of small number of patients (n=2 to 4). 
Immunogenicity 
As stated by the MAH, in healthy volunteers, the proportion of subjects with positive results for ADA was 
higher in the CT-P13 SC cohorts compared to the CT-P13 IV cohort in Study CT-P13 1.5. On the contrary, 
in the patient studies (Studies CT-P13 3.5 and CT-P13 1.6), the ADA results showed a trend to lower 
proportions of patients with positive ADA response in the CT-P13 SC cohorts compared to the IV cohort. 
Generally,  regardless  of  treatment-arm,  the  proportion  of  ADA-positive  individuals  appeared  lower  in 
patients than in healthy subjects, but this phenomenon was most pronounced in the SC arms. 
In  the  pivotal  clinical  trial  in  RA  patients,  the  frequency  of  ADA-positivity  was  lower  in  the  SC  vs.  IV 
group (49.4 vs. 72.0% up to Week 54). After switching to the SC formulation at Week 30 the proportion 
of patients who had positive ADA results in the CT-P13 IV arm reduced to 36.6% at week 54. However, 
it is possible that some low-titre ADAs in patients receiving CT-P13 SC have not been detected. Because 
of very different drug concentrations in the IV and SC groups the sensitivity to detect ADAs was different 
and therefore the treatment arms are not comparable in the lower range of ADA titres. 
Most ADAs were neutralizing and there seemed to be no major difference between the groups regarding 
proportion of Nabs per ADA (69.4% vs. 60.7% for SC and IV respectively at week 30). 
Assessment Report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/548703/2019  
Page 133/150 
 
 
 
The MAH has provided an estimate of the amount of patients with a possible false negative NAb result. 
Taking into consideration the drug tolerance level and drug serum concentration when the samples were 
taken, 15 (6.8%) patients had at least one potential false negative NAb sample due to a serum CT-P13 
level over 10 μg/mL. Considering that 65 subjects (37.0%) in the IV arm were classified as NAb-positive 
at week 30 and 43 subjects (24.6%) at week 54, it seems that the drop in Nab frequency cannot be 
solely attributed to potentially false negative samples. Therefore, it seems that at least some conversion 
from seropositive to seronegative occurred after switching from IV to SC. In addition, the NAb frequency 
was constantly slightly lower in the SC arm, also after switching. Therefore, even if some of the NAbs 
went undetected due to higher drug concentrations and low sensitivity to detect low titres of NAbs, the 
formation of NAbs was not greater with the SC formulation. 
ADA presence in serum resulted in an overall decrease of drug exposure, as  expected, with a similar 
trend in both arms. Mean Ctrough drug concentrations remained around the level of 3 μg/mL among ADA 
negative subjects in the IV treatment arm up to Week 30. Among ADA positive subjects treated with IV, 
Ctrough concentrations were mostly well below 1 μg/mL. In the SC treatment arm the presence of ADA in 
serum also resulted in a substantial decrease in drug levels but mean drug levels in ADA-positive patients 
treated with SC were still consistently above 1 μg/mL. Taking into account that a serum level of 1 μg/mL 
is considered the threshold for efficacy, these results indicate that patients treated with Remsima SC at 
the proposed posology could have a better probability of maintaining therapeutic serum drug levels than 
those treated with IV Remsima, even if they develop ADAs. 
At  week  30  the  frequency  of  moderate  and  high  titres  (thought  to  be  clinically  significant)  of  ADAs 
seemed comparable between the two treatment arms, even though the frequency of low titres was lower 
in the SC arm (possibly due to under detection). At the end of week 54 the titres were similar in both 
treatment  arms  even  if  the  titres  remained  marginally  lower  in  the  patients  initially  treated  with  IV 
Remsima.  Because of  the very  different drug levels influencing  the  ADA  assay,  comparing  titre  levels 
between the treatment arms is not completely reliable. 
It is not completely clear what level of ADA titre leads to a clinically significant drop in drug concentration. 
A substantial drop in mean drug concentrations was seen in both treatment arms already at the lowest 
ADA  titres.  In  the  IV  arm  ADA  titres  as  low  as  ≤  92  were  accompanied  by  mean  drug  levels  below 
1 μg/mL,  whereas  in the  SC  group,  drug levels  remained on  average  above  1  μg/mL  as  long  as  ADA 
titres were < 736. This finding shows that defining a cut-point for where ADA titre becomes clinically 
significant is not feasible. 
With  regards  to  the  effect  of  ADA  on  patient  safety,  particularly  for  TEAE,  TESAE  and  infections,  no 
consistent  correlations  were  observed  between  the ADA  formation  and  the occurrence  of  the  adverse 
events  across  all  clinical  studies.  The  percentages  of  latent  tuberculosis  were  almost  double  in  ADA 
positive arms. The difference between ADA positive and ADA negative subjects in both treatment arms 
was similar in this respect. The numbers are too limited to allow conclusions and the occurrence of latent 
tuberculosis in relation to ADA positivity remains unclear. However, this issue will not be pursued further 
as more safety data particularly concerning latent tuberculosis may be obtained from ongoing clinical 
studies and proposed post-approval SC programme. 
The  immunogenicity  of  Remsima  SC  applied  through  either  an  autoinjector  or  prefilled  syringe  is  not 
expected to influence the immunogenicity of the product, and this was supported by the data from study 
CT-P13 1.9. 
The population to be treated with Remsima SC will be partly different from the population treated with 
Remsima IV. It will consist of patients who have switched from the Remsima IV and patients that have 
been treated with other anti-TNFα products administered subcutaneously. Remsima is very immunogenic 
and the immune response to infliximab is likely to be partly similar (anti-TNF-binding site) and partly 
different as compared to other anti-TNF products that do not contain murine sequences. The differences

Page 134/150 
 
 
 
may include different types of antibodies and antibody-antigen complexes. Such differences may lead to 
hypersensitivity reactions, including acute and delayed hypersensitivity reaction. 
In the 54-week data from Study CT-P13 3.5 switching from IV to SC did not give rise to an increased 
ADA positivity. On the contrary, the proportion of ADA positive patients was reduced after switching from 
IV to SC. However, this result can partly be explained by lower sensitivity to detect ADAs in patients with 
higher drug concentrations. Likewise, switching from IV to SC did not affect the efficacy. If anything, the 
subjects gained better efficacy after switching from IV to SC. There were no new safety concerns after 
switching. Overall, the results from CT-P13 3.5 Part 2 suggest that switching from CT-P13 IV to CT-P13 
SC does not have an impact on safety. Data on switching from IV infliximab or other subcutaneously 
administered anti-TNF products to CT-P13 SC will be collected in the observational safety study in RA 
patients planned to assess AEs associated with the use of CT-P13 SC (Study CT-P13 4.8). 
In  conclusion,  the  current  data  provide  evidence  for  a  comparable  immunogenicity  profile  between 
Remisma dosing through subcutaneous route compared to IV route. There is some uncertainty regarding 
the bioanalytical assays to detect ADAs. However, even if there is a possibility of undetected ADAs in the 
SC  arm,  the  number  of  ADAs  should  not  be  higher  in  the  SC  arm  than  in  the  IV  arm.  Moreover,  the 
results of non-inferior efficacy and safety are convincing. Therefore, the issue of undetected low titres 
will not be pursued further. 
2.8.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In general, the safety profile of intravenous infliximab is well established. However, safety data for SC 
infliximab is still relatively limited. 
In the main RA-study, the SC route of administration was associated with reduced occurrence of systemic 
infusion-related reactions (IRR), which have been associated with the IV route, whilst the injection site 
reactions (ISR) were more common in the SC group. MAH has clarified the classification of the systemic 
and local infusion and injection site reactions. The occurrence of an administration related reactions is 
not  an  unexpected  event  and  implications  for  the  Benefit/Risk  balance  of  this  known  risk  given  the 
change in treatment setting (self-administration at home) should be considered. The MAH has included 
appropriate warnings in the SmPC and Patient Information on this. The MAH has also confirmed that no 
specific premedication for SC injection is required in accordance with SC treatment of other comparable 
products.  In  addition,  updated  information  concerning  adverse  events  (particularly  those  related  to 
injection reactions) and self-administration at home, as well as handling of the missed dose has been 
reflected in the product information.  
Otherwise the safety profile seemed broadly similar between the IV and SC formulations (TEAEs, TESAEs, 
laboratory data). There was no increase in the incidence of infection risk in general, and opportunistic 
infections in particular. Modelling analyses showed no association between Remsima SC PK profile and 
incidence  of  infections.  The  database  is,  however,  too  limited  to  allow  analysis  concerning  more  rare 
adverse  events  and  occurrence  of  malignancies.  The  MAH 
therefore  proposed  additional 
pharmacovigilance activities with regards to “Long term treatment” with SC infliximab (Study CT-P13 
4.8), as detailed in the RMP. 
Generally,  regardless  of  treatment-arm,  the  proportion  of  ADA-positive  individuals  appeared  lower  in 
patients  than  in  healthy  subjects.  The  reason  for  this  is  not  entirely  clear  and  it  can  be  questioned 
whether the use of immunosuppressants can play a role. In the pivotal RA-study the frequency of ADA-
positivity  at  week  30  was  lower  in  the  SC  group  compared  to  IV  group.  After  switching  to  the  SC 
formulation at Week 30 the proportion of patients who had positive ADA was similar between treatment 
arms up to week 54. ADA presence in serum resulted in an overall decrease of drug exposure. There 
was a statistically and clinically non-significant tendency for weaker DAS28 improvement in ADA-positive

EMA/CHMP/548703/2019  
Page 135/150 
 
 
 
RA patients compared to ADA-negative patients in both SC and IV groups. With regards to the effect of 
ADA on patient safety, no consistent correlations were observed between ADA and the occurrence of the 
adverse events across all studies. However, the amount of latent tuberculosis was higher among ADA 
positive subjects, but the treatment arms were similar to each other. 
The clinical safety and immunogenicity data from study CT-P13 1.9 and the usability part of study CT-
P13 3.5 part 2 did not indicate any increased risks for the AI compared to the PFS. 
The  PK  data  showed  that  infliximab  Ctrough  concentrations  were  constantly  higher  (>10-fold)  after  SC 
dosing when compared to the IV route. However, no increased safety concerns related to higher drug 
concentrations were detected in the provided clinical data. 
Even with the extended follow-up, the safety database can be considered limited and robust post-
approval safety follow-up programme including patients with SC dosing is needed and additional 
studies have been proposed in the RMP.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
This is a line extension application to introduce a subcutaneous formulation of Remsima IV, which is a 
biosimilar of EU approved Remicade. 
The folowing indication for Remsima SC is sought: 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
Remsima, in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for the reduction of signs and symptoms as 
well as the improvement in physical function in: 
• 
• 
adult patients with active disease when the response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs 
(DMARDs), including methotrexate, has been inadequate. 
adult  patients  with  severe,  active  and  progressive  disease  not  previously  treated  with 
methotrexate or other DMARDs. 
In these patient populations, a reduction in the rate of the progression of joint damage, as measured by 
X-ray, has been demonstrated (see section 5.1).  
The  MAH  has  withdrawn  the  initial  application  for  indications  ankylosing  spondylitis,  psoriatic  arthritis 
and psoriasis and is not seeking for the IBD indications, not for adults nor children, in this submission. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There  are  several  medicinal  products  containing  infliximab  for  intravenous  infusion  on  the  market. 
However, no subcutaneously administered infliximab is available so far. Several other TNFα inhibitors 
are  available  in  SC  formulation  with  similar  indications  as  Remicade.  Thus,  this  application  does  not 
address an unmet need. 
The  availability  of  a  SC  formulation  of  infliximab  would  increase  the  treatment  options  available  to 
patients, facilitate administration and add convenience. Potential benefits of SC administration include 
optimisation of medical resources. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study CT-P13 3.5: 
This was a multi-dose, randomised, controlled, parallel group, 54-week study to evaluate PK, efficacy 
and safety of CT-P13 SC in RA patients. 
Part 1 was conducted to, based on PK-data determine the optimal dose of CT-P13 SC in 48 RA patients, 
whereas Part 2 is performing to establish therapeutic non-inferiority (based on clinical efficacy) of CT-
P13 SC compared with CT-P13 IV in 343 RA patients. 
Part 1 of study CT-P13 3.5 was considered as the RA dose finding study. It was an open-label study that 
that compared CT-P13 SC (in 3 different dose levels; 90, 120 and 180 mg at week 6 and then every 
2 weeks) and CT-P13 IV (3 mg/kg at week 6 and then every 8 weeks) when co-administered with MTX 
in  patients  with  active  RA  who  were  not  adequately  responding  to  MTX.  The  study  included  a  dose-
loading phase during which all enrolled patients initially were to receive a 2-hour CT-P13 IV infusion at 
Weeks 0 and 2. 
Assessment Report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/548703/2019  
Page 140/150 
 
 
 
Part 2 of CT-P13 3.5 was considered as the pivotal clinical study in RA. The primary objective of CT-P13 
3.5, Part 2 was to demonstrate that CT-P13 SC (120 mg at week 6 and then every 2 weeks) is non-
inferior to CTP13 IV (3 mg/kg at week 6 and then every 8 weeks) at Week 22, in terms of efficacy, as 
determined by clinical response according to change from baseline in disease activity as measured by 
Disease Activity Score using DAS28 (CRP). This pivotal trial comprised 167 patients in the Remsima SC 
120mg treatment arm and 176 patients in the Remsima IV 3mg/kg treatment arm. All enrolled patients 
initially received Remsima IV 3mg/kg infusion at Weeks 0 and 2. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The efficacy of Remsima IV has been established during initial marketing authorisation assessment. The 
primary purpose of this application is to show non-inferiority of Remsima SC to Remsima IV in terms of 
efficacy without additional safety concerns. In terms of PK the objective of the proposed Remsima SC 
dosing regimen in treatment of RA was to maintain the steady state Ctrough >1 μg/mL and to align AUC 
over 8 weeks as closely as possible to that achieved following 3 mg/kg IV administration. 
In patients with active RA and concomitantly treated with methotrexate the following favourable effects 
were seen: 
The proportion of patients that achieved the target Ctrough (>1 µg/mL) in Remsima SC cohort was 81.8% 
(126/154), while only 28.5% (45/158) in the IV population reached the target. 
The mean change from baseline in DAS28 (CRP) at Week 22 was 2.21 and 1.94 in SC 120 mg and IV 3 
mg/kg  treatment  arms,  respectively.  This  response  is  comparable  to  previous  findings  in  RA  patients 
treated with Remsima IV. The decline in DAS28(CRP) scores continued after week 6 up until week 54 
and was similar between treatment arms. 
The estimate of treatment difference was 0.27 with corresponding lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI 
of 0.02, which was greater than the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -0.6 indicating non-inferiority 
of SC 120 mg compared to IV 3 mg/kg. 
By  week  30  92.7%  in  the  SC  120mg  arm  and  83.3%  in  the  IV  3mg/kg  arm  had  achieved  a  good  or 
moderate clinical response according to EULAR response criteria (based on DAS28 [CRP]). 
The results of all secondary outcome endpoints were in line with the primary outcome and supported the 
observation of equal, if not even better efficacy of Remsima SC compared to Remsima IV up to week 54. 
There  were  no  apparent  differences  in  efficacy  among  subject  according  to  region,  age,  race,  body 
weight, CRP at screening or DAS28 score at baseline. Thus, the clinical efficacy results are considered 
robust over all the analyzed subgroups.  
Of note, among patients who developed ADAs, clinical response was significantly better in the SC arm 
than among ADA positive patients in the IV arm. This is probably explained by the fact that most ADA 
positive patients who were treated with IV Remsima had very low drug concentrations, while the drug 
concentrations remained on average above the threshold of 1 μg/mL even among ADA-positive subjects 
when treated with SC. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The main factor that might affect persistence of response in a different manner for the two routes of 
administration is immunogenicity and the formation of NABs. The efficacy results from study CT-P13 3.5 
Part  2  showed  good  persistence of  response  throughout  the  whole  54-week  treatment  period in  both 
treatment  arms.  Therefore,  the  possible  differences  in  Nab  formation  do  not  affect  the  conclusion 
regarding non-inferiority in efficacy.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Unfavourable effects for infliximab 
In  general,  unfavourable effects  associated  with  the  use  of  TNF-blockers  that  have  been  reported  for 
infliximab (Remsima SmPC), also apply for Remsima SC with the exception of acute infusion reactions 
(as  no  infusion  is  given).  However,  the  risk  of  administration  related  reactions  (including 
hypersensitivity) exist. 
The  most  serious  ADRs  with  infliximab  include  the  following:  SC  hepatitis  B  virus  (HBV)  reactivation, 
congestive  heart  failure  (CHF),  serious  infections  (including  sepsis,  opportunistic  infections  and 
tuberculosis  [TB]),  serious  infusion  reactions,  serum  sickness  (delayed  hypersensitivity  [i.e.,  delayed 
type  hypersensitivity/type  IV  hypersensitivity]  reactions),  haematologic  reactions,  systemic  lupus 
erythematosus/lupuslike  syndrome,  demyelinating  disorders,  hepatobiliary  events,  malignancies 
including  lymphoma,  hepatosplenic  T-cell  lymphoma  (HSTCL),  leukaemia,  Merkel  cell  carcinoma, 
melanoma, paediatric malignancy, sarcoidosis/sarcoid-like reaction. 
Unfavourable effects for SC infliximab 
Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  Remsima  SC  in  RA  patients  was  similar  to  the  safety  profile  of  the 
intravenous formulation, except for ISR and ARR. No clear additional unfavourable effects, except ISR, 
could be identified. 
According to safety results in the pivotal RA Study CT-P13 the proportion of patients who experienced 
at least 1 TEAE during the maintenance phase was slightly higher in the IV arm compared to the SC arm 
(92 [54.1%] patients and 113 [63.5%] patients in SC and IV respectively. The most frequently reported 
TEAEs in the SC arm were localised ISR (28 [16.5%] patients) followed by viral upper respiratory tract 
infection (10 [5.9%] patients). The most frequently reported TEAEs during the maintenance phase for 
patients in the IV arm were localised ISR (22 [12.4%] patients) followed by viral upper respiratory tract 
infection (10 [5.6%] patients). 
With safety data up to 54 weeks there were 13 (7.3%) patients in the IV arm and 6 (3.5%) patients in 
the SC arm with at least one TESAEs. The TESAEs included 3 (1.8%) and 1 (0.6%) cases of infections 
for the SC and IV arms, respectively, and five deaths cases. The other TESAEs were mainly single cases 
each. The majority of TESAEs were grade 3 or lower in intensity. 
The incidence and severity of infections with Remsima SC and IV administration were comparable and 
in line with Remsima SmPC. With the safety data up to 54 weeks, the incidence of patients with infections 
was 48 (28.2%) in the SC arm and 54 (30.3%) in the IV arm. The majority of infections were of grade 
1 or 2 in intensity. The most commonly reported infection was viral upper respiratory tract infection. No 
clear  differences  in  opportunistic  infections  between  the  study  arms  were  observed.  Overall,  the 
incidence of infections and different types of infections were comparable with the historical controls. 
Concerning  infusion  and  injection  reactions  the  MAH  has  revised  the  terminology  based  on  the  new 
classification, TEAEs classified as IRR during the treatment period were reported for 2 (1.2%) patients 
in  SC  arm  and  10  (5.6%)  patients  in  IV  arm.  Treatment-emergent  AEs  classified  as  ISR  during  the 
treatment period were reported for 2 (1.2%) patients in SC arm and 3 (1.7%) patients in IV arm. 
Treatment-emergent  AEs  classified  as  delayed  hypersensitivity  during  the  treatment  period  were 
reported for 3 (1.8%) patients in SC arm and 1 (0.6%) patient in IV 3 arm. Treatment-emergent AEs 
classified  as  localised  ISR  during  the  treatment  period  were  reported  for  28  (16.5%)  patients  in  SC 
120 mg treatment arm and 22 (12.4%) patients in IV 3 mg/kg treatment arm. 
In the SmPC, the safety data is reported as incidence per 100 patient years, excluding patients from the 
non-compliant  site.  The  incidence  of  systemic  injection  reactions  (e.g.  rash,  pruritus,  flushing  and

oedema) was 1.2 per 100 patient-years in the Remsima subcutaneous group (from Week 6) and 2.1 per 
100  patient-years  in  the  Remsima  intravenous  group  who  switched  to  Remsima  subcutaneous 
administration (from Week 30). 
In the pivotal clinical trial in RA patients, the frequency of ADA-positivity at week 30 was lower in the SC 
vs.  IV  group  (38.2  vs.  69.7%  at  week  30).  Most  ADAs  were  neutralizing  and  there  seemed  to  be  no 
difference  between  the  groups  regarding  proportion  of  NAbs/ADAs  (66.9%  vs.  75.4%  for  SC  and  IV 
respectively).  After  switching  to  the  SC  formulation  at  Week  30  the  proportion  of  patients  who  had 
positive ADA results in the Remsima IV arm reduced to 38.2% by week 54. However, it is possible that 
some  low-titre  ADAs  in  patients  receiving  Remsima  SC  have  not  been  detected.  Hence,  it  cannot  be 
concluded that Remsima SC is less immunogenic than Remsima IV. However, there is no indication of 
higher immunogenicity. 
The treatment-emergent AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug during the treatment 
period were reported for 5 (2.9%) patients in SC 120 mg treatment arm and 14 (7.9%) patients in IV 
3 mg/kg treatment arm. 
A total of 5 deaths were reported during the treatment period up to Week 54, 3 among patients who 
were receiving Remsima SC and 2 among patients in the IV arm. The causes of death in the SC arm 
were hereditary haemochromatosis, myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest. All the death cases were 
considered by the investigator not related to the study medication. 
There were no findings from the other clinical studies in the application that would imply a worse safety 
profile for Remsima SC (in the proposed dose) compared to Remsima IV (in the approved dose) regarding 
treatment of  RA  patients.  The  frequency  of  ADA,  were  both  in  the  IV  and the SC  arms  in  the  clinical 
patient studies, including the pivotal RA study, higher than numbers that have been previously reported 
for infliximab and presented in the SmPC but not higher among the patients treated with SC compared 
to IV. The MAH conducted analysis of the relationship between ADA-status and clinical outcome in Study 
CT-P13  3.5  Part  2  up  to  week  54  and  concluded  that  ADA-status  only  marginally  affected  clinical 
response. ADA presence in serum resulted in an overall decrease of drug exposure. It was also noted 
that patients positive for ADA had a higher prevalence of latent tuberculosis, but the treatment arms did 
not differ from each other in this respect. 
In conclusion, with regards to serious adverse events and deaths, the safety profile of Remsima SC in 
the proposed dose range did not appear worse than Remsima IV. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
In general, the safety profile of infliximab IV is well established. However, the sample size and duration 
of SC infliximab treatment in the pivotal study in RA patients are still limited. According to data provided 
by the MAH, 196 patients overall (174 RA and 22 CD patients) have been treated with CT-P13 SC for 
54 weeks, 166 of these patients (157 RA and 9  CD patients) with the proposed posology of 120 mg 
Q2W. In addition, 81 of the RA patients in study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2 continued the treatment for 64 weeks. 
A  total  of  52  (14.9%)  patients  discontinued  the  maintenance  phase  up  to  end  of  study  (22 [13.0%] 
patients and 30 [16.8%] patients in the SC 120 mg and IV 3 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively). The 
long-term safety database in patients with RA has thus been extended. However, the numbers are still 
limited  to  identify  potential  rare  and  severe  adverse  events.  More  post-approval  safety  data  is  thus 
required. 
On Remsima SC dosing the mean AUC-values and Ctrough levels were constantly and in long-term higher 
compared to Remsima IV. The effects of this higher long-term exposure to infliximab on patient safety 
(e.g. infections, autoimmune diseases and malignancies) are unknown. Concerning malignancies, several 
Assessment Report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation

Page 143/150 
 
 
 
years of follow-up would be required. However, in the 54-week data, no increased safety concerns related 
to higher drug concentrations were detected. 
Some methodological weaknesses preclude complete assessment of the immunogenicity data. Because 
of very different drug concentrations in the IV and SC groups the sensitivity to detect ADAs was different 
and therefore the treatment arms are not comparable in the lower range of ADA titres. In the IV arm 
ADA titres as low as ≤ 92 were accompanied by mean drug levels below 1 μg/mL, whereas in the SC 
group, drug levels remained on average above 1 μg/mL as long as ADA titres were < 736. This finding 
shows that defining a cut-point for where ADA titre becomes clinically significant is not feasible. However, 
it seems that ADA titres at levels below the detection limit would not have a clinical impact on efficacy 
in patients treated with Remsima SC because the drug concentrations remain high despite a substantial 
drop in concentration due to antibody formation. 
Moreover, even if there is a possibility of undetected ADAs in the SC arm, the number of ADAs should 
not be higher in the SC arm than in the IV arm. In addition, no new concern regarding ADA related safety 
issues  have  emerged in  SC  treated  patients.  Therefore,  the  issue of  undetected  low  titres  will  not  be 
pursued further. 
It  is  obvious  that  the  population  to  be  treated  with  Remsima  SC  will  be  partly  different  from  the 
population treated with Remsima IV. It will consist of patients switched from the Remsima IV and patients 
that have been treated with other anti-TNF-alfa products administered subcutaneously. Remsima is very 
immunogenic and the immune response to infliximab is likely to be partly similar (anti-TNF-binding site) 
and partly different as compared to other anti-TNF products that do not contain murine sequences. The 
differences may include different types of antibodies and antibody-antigen complexes. Such differences 
may lead to hypersensitivity reactions, including acute and delayed hypersensitivity reaction. In the 54-
week data from Study CT-P13 3.5 switching from IV to SC did not give rise to an increased ADA positivity. 
Likewise, switching from IV to SC did not affect the efficacy. There were no new safety concerns after 
switching. Further data on switching from IV infliximab or other subcutaneously administered anti-TNF 
products to CT-P13 SC will be collected in the observational safety study in RA patients planned to assess 
AEs associated with the use of CT-P13 SC (Study CT-P13 4.8 as detailed in the RMP). 
Further,  cases  of  jaundice  and  non-infectious  hepatitis,  some  with  features  of  autoimmune  hepatitis, 
have  been  observed  in  the  post-marketing  experience  of  infliximab,  including  cases  of  liver  failure 
resulting  in  liver  transplantation  or  death  (Remsima  SmPC).  In  Study  CT-P13  3.5,  even  though  the 
numbers are small, there were numerically more Grade 3 or 4 liver enzyme elevations in the SC arm. 
To summarize, for the sought RA indication, the uncertainties with regards to the unfavourable effects 
pertain mainly to the fact that there is still relatively limited safety data that would allow for a complete 
comparative safety assessment with Remsima IV.  Additional pharmacovigilance activities with regards 
to Long term treatment with SC infliximab (CT-P13 3.8 and CT-P13 4.8) have been proposed in the RMP.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic and potentially disabling systemic inflammatory disease. An established 
treatment option  for  these  patients is  IV  infliximab. In  addition,  several  other  anti-TNF-alfa-inhibitors 
are already available as SC formulations. Therefore, the SC infliximab is not fulfilling any unmet medical 
need as such.

However,  a  SC  formulation  of  infliximab  has  significant  practical  advantages  over  the  current  IV 
formulation. IV administration of infliximab takes place in hospitals and outpatient clinics. The use of the 
IV formulation causes both administrative costs for hospitals and inconvenience to patients to be treated 
with infliximab that could be avoided by a formulation intended for SC administration. Self-administration 
of  SC  infliximab  allows  greater  flexibility  and  ability  for  home  use,  which  may  affect  quality  of  life  of 
patients. The fixed dose approach in RA-patients is simple and practical and may diminish the risk of 
medication errors. Further, from the medical point of view, one benefit of the SC route of administration 
is that it does not require an IV access after the initial IV loading dose, which is especially important for 
patients with poor venous access. The shorter administration time is also a benefit for patients. 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Importance of favourable effects 
The efficacy and safety of Remsima IV have been established, as it is a biosimilar to Remicade. Since no 
formal bioequivalence can be established between Remsima SC and Remsima IV, non-inferior efficacy 
and safety of Remsima SC must be shown to ensure a positive benefit-risk balance. 
Only one double blind RCT performed in the intended target population was submitted. The number of 
patients  was  small,  167  RA  patients-initiated  treatment  with  Remsima  SC.  The  follow  up  duration  of 
54 weeks is acceptable for evaluation of persistence of treatment response and immunogenicity. 
The primary efficacy endpoint in the pivotal RA study was defined as the change from baseline in disease 
activity measured by DAS28 (CRP) at Week 22, which is a clinically relevant endpoint. 
Patients in both treatment arms reached clinically significant response in the DAS28(CRP) score by week 
6 and the response persisted throughout the reported period of 54 weeks. The magnitude of response 
in patients treated with Remsima SC (mean change from baseline of -3.2 points in DAS28(CRP) at week 
54)  is  classified  as  good  according  to  EULAR  response  criteria.  The  results  of  all  secondary  outcome 
endpoints were in line with the primary outcome and supported the observation of non-inferior, if not 
even better efficacy of Remsima SC compared to Remsima IV up to week 30 and a good persistence of 
response  after  switching  from  IV  to  SC.  The  results  were  in  line  with  historical  data  and  were  also 
supported by improvement in quality of life, which supports the notion of robustness. 
However, it must be noted that the treatment arms were identical until week 6 and the main part of the 
response  was  already  achieved  by  week  6.  Also,  the  difference  between  treatment  arms  was  already 
seen at week 6 and hence cannot be taken as an indication of superiority of the SC formulation. Moreover, 
the difference between treatment arms after 22 weeks of treatment (0.27 points in DAS 28 (CRP)) in 
favour of Remsima SC is not considered clinically significant, but superiority does not need to be shown. 
The pivotal study (study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2) is in effect more suitable to show the efficacy of maintenance 
treatment  and  the  results  should  be  interpreted  with  focus  on  the  change  from  week  6,  rather  than 
change from baseline. In essence, the data only supports the use of Remsima SC after an initial loading 
dose with the IV Remsima. 
The high initial concentration of infliximab achieved only with IV administration might be crucial to the 
induction of response. Whether the same response may be achieved with the subcutaneous formulation, 
without initial loading with IV infliximab, is not known. This fact is adequately reflected in the SmPC since 
Remsima SC is only proposed to be initiated after a loading dose comprising two intravenous infusions 
of infliximab. 
Region, age, race, body weight and CRP at screening had no apparent effect on efficacy. Thus, the clinical 
efficacy results are considered robust over all the analyzed subgroups. 
Assessment Report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/548703/2019  
Page 146/150 
 
 
 
At Week 22 the mean difference in mean change from week 6 of DAS28 (CRP) was equal for the two 
study arms (or better in the SC arm) in almost all subgroups. The only subgroup where the IV treated 
patients  had  significantly  better  efficacy  results  than  the  SC  treated  patients  was  the  non-Caucasian 
subgroup. This subgroup had similar efficacy in both study arms when assessed as change from baseline. 
Moreover, the difference between races seems to reflect a delayed response in the IV arm rather than a 
lesser response in the SC arm. Therefore, based on these results no caution related to race is warranted. 
The  usability  of  both  AI  and  PSF  devises  are  acceptable  in  terms  of  patient  satisfaction  and  rate  of 
successfully and appropriately completed self-administration. In conclusion, Remsima SC was shown to 
be non-inferior to Remsima IV in terms of efficacy over a 30-week period. The response persisted over 
the whole 54-week treatment and was robust over different subgroups. Since the SC formulation was 
consistently shown to give rise to slightly better results than the IV formulation, there is no reason to 
question  the  non-inferiority  despite  the  fact  that  the  sensitivity  of  the  study  to  demonstrate  non-
inferiority was not optimal. 
Importance of unfavourable effects 
Overall,  it  can  be  agreed  with  the  MAH  that  the  selected  SC  treatment  resulted  in  only  marginal 
differences in clinical safety across the weight bands in the RA-study Study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2. Thus for 
the  RA-indication,  there  are  no  signals  from  the  clinical  data  that  the  proposed  posology  would  be 
inaccurate in that regard. 
In  general,  the  safety  profile  of  infliximab  IV  is  well  established.  However,  after  SC  administration 
especially the long-term safety data is limited. Based on limited safety database, the safety profile for 
Remsima  SC  and  IV  were  in  general  comparable,  and  only  few  SAEs  were  reported.  There  were  no 
unexpected unfavourable effects, but several uncertainties exist. 
The  only  new  unfavourable  effect  identified  after  SC  dosing  were  injections  site  reactions,  which  are 
common for SC dosing in general. However, ISRs in the SC arm in the pivotal study were all mild or 
moderate in severity and all manageable. However, ARR is not an unexpected event and implications for 
the BR balance of this known risk given the change in treatment setting (self-administration at home) 
has  been  considered  and  appropriate  warnings  have  been  included  in  the  product  information, 
educational material and will be followed up in the RMP.  
A total of 5 deaths; 3 patients treated with SC and 2 patients treated with IV only, were reported during 
the treatment period up to Week 54 in the pivotal RA study. The causes of deaths for the patients treated 
with SC were hereditary haemochromatosis, myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest. The contribution 
of the administration of the study medication in some of the death cases cannot be fully excluded, but 
all the death cases were considered by the investigator not related to the study medication. In the whole 
SC  database  (including  non-RA  indications)  seven  cases  of  death  occurred  on  the  study  drug 
administrations. However, no autopsy was performed, and no further data is available. Any deaths events 
will be carefully followed-up in the post-marketing safety study.  
Even though there were no additional clear safety findings, there were several uncertainties, which were 
not fully clarified with extended safety database. 
Particularly the adverse events concerning infections (including opportunistic infections) and the effects 
of  higher  exposure  of  infliximab  after  SC  administration  e.g.,  on  malignant  tumours,  needs  to  be 
established in long-term, and therefore additional pharmacovigilance activities with regards to Long term 
treatment with SC infliximab (CT-P13 3.8 and CT-P13 4.8) have been proposed in the RMP. 
Immunogenicity 
This is a totally new SC formulation of a very immunogenic product (with 30% murine variable region 
amino acid sequence), administered via a highly immunogenic route (SC). The composition of the SC 
Assessment Report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/548703/2019  
Page 147/150 
 
 
 
product  is  largely  similar  to  the  IV  product  already  on  market  and  should  not  be  inherently  more 
immunogenic.  The  administration  route  and  the  considerable  difference  in  PK  profiles  might  have  in 
theory altered the immunogenic response. However, the current data provide preliminary evidence for 
a comparable immunogenicity profile between Remisma dosing through subcutaneous route compared 
to IV route and no new concern regarding ADA related safety issues have emerged in SC treated patients. 
The MAH conducted analysis of the relationship between ADA-status and clinical outcome in Study CT-
P13 3.5 Part 2 up to week 54 and concluded that ADA-status only marginally affected clinical response 
and did not affect the rates of infections or hypersensitivity reactions. 
The frequency of ADA was higher both in the IV arm and in the SC arm than frequencies that have been 
previously reported for infliximab and presented in the SmPC but not higher among the patients treated 
with SC Remsima compared to IV Remsima. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The efficacy and safety profile of infliximab IV is well established. The clearly higher drug concentrations 
during  SC  administration  did  not  seem  to  translate  into  a  higher  risk  for  infections  or  other  adverse 
events, although the number of patients and duration of follow-up is still limited. 
The total number of RA patients exposed for one year to CT-P13 SC in the proposed posology has been 
clarified (n=148 in study CT-P13 3.5 Part 2 and an additional 9 in study CT-P13 3.5 Part 1). The number 
of patients is limited but can be considered acceptable. Remsima is a biosimilar and there are plenty of 
data on exposure to the originator Remicade IV and to Remsima IV. 
Some uncertainty remains regarding the effect of higher Ctrough levels of infliximab on the potential risk 
of  some  rare  adverse  events  (e.g.  cardiac  AEs);  long-term  safety  will  be  further  studied  in  a  post-
approval PV programme (including a non-interventional study in patients with RA). 
The 2.2 point improvement in DAS28(CRP) score achieved with Remsima SC at week 22 and maintained 
over a period of 54 weeks is clinically relevant and the difference between SC and IV Remsima is neither 
clinically nor statistically significant. The benefit of the product has been demonstrated in RA-patients 
with concomitant methotrexate use. 
The safety profiles for SC and IV were in general comparable. The only new unfavourable effect identified 
after SC dosing were injections site reactions which were observed in 17.9% of patients in the SC arm 
and  were  all  mild  or  moderate  in  severity  and  all  manageable,  which  is  reflected  in  the  product 
information.  Also,  immunogenicity  seemed  comparable  between  SC  and  IV  formulations  (if  anything, 
immunogenicity was lower in SC group). 
Based on these considerations, the benefit/risk balance is positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Indication 
Even  if  Remsima  SC  is  only  used  as  “maintenance  therapy”  (after  IV-loading  dose),  the  wording  of 
therapeutic indications, as detailed in the SmPC, was agreed to remain equal to those of IV-Remsima 
(and IV Remicade), as the Remsima SC line extension is largely based on extrapolation on data from IV 
Remsima and especially on data from originator IV Remicade. 
The IV formulation of infliximab is indicated for patients with active RA when the response to DMARDs, 
including  methotrexate,  has  been  inadequate,  and  also  for  RA-patients  with  severe,  active  and 
progressive disease not previously treated with methotrexate or other DMARDs. The non-inferior efficacy 
Assessment Report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/548703/2019  
Page 148/150 
 
 
 
of SC infliximab as compared to IV infliximab was demonstrated in second line setting, more specifically 
in the MTX-inadequate responders. 
It  is  plausible  to  expect  that  the  two  formulations  that  are  comparable  in  this  setting  would  also  be 
comparable  in  the  setting  of  RA-patients  with  severe,  active  and  progressive  disease  not  previously 
treated with DMARDs. Hence, the data can be extrapolated to this other RA population. The similar anti-
inflammatory  effects  in  this  setting  can  also  be  extrapolated  to  retardation  of  joint  damage  that  is 
mentioned in the proposed therapeutic RA-indication. Notwithstanding, according to current regulatory 
practices, endpoints should not be included in the indication, as in the currently proposed RA indication 
(“reduction  in  the  rate  of  the  progression  of  joint  damage,  as  measured  by  X-ray”);  however,  as 
discussed, it is preferable to keep the indications aligned between IV and SC Remsima, as well as with 
reference medicinal product Remicade, and hence this wording is acceptable. 
In addition, it is agreed that using “infliximab” within the sentence “Remsima, following an initial dose 
of  two  intravenous infusions  of  infliximab…”  in the  indication  statement is  acceptable.  This is  albeit it 
refers to changing from all different IV infliximab-products to Remsima SC, while the evidence is only 
from switching (after the loading dose) from Remsima IV to Remsima SC. However, as Remsima is a 
biosimilar medicinal product to Remicade, and there is sufficient evidence already from switching from 
at least from Remicade IV to Remsima IV, it is assumed that all of the biosimilar infliximab-products and 
Remicade are similar here and hence there is no need to specify that the switch could only occur from 
Remsima IV to Remsima SC (and not from other IV infliximab products). 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Remsima SC for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality and safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the benefit-risk balance of, Remsima in the new subcutaneous pharmaceutical forms is 
favourable in the following indication: 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
Remsima, in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for the reduction of signs and symptoms as 
well as the improvement in physical function in:  
• 
• 
adult patients with active disease when the response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs 
(DMARDs), including methotrexate, has been inadequate.  
adult patients with severe, active and progressive disease not previously treated with 
methotrexate or other DMARDs.  
In these patient populations, a reduction in the rate of the progression of joint damage, as measured 
by X-ray, has been demonstrated (see section 5.1).  
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for Remsima subject 
to the following conditions:

Description 
Immunogenicity and safety of the booster dose during the second year of life concomitantly with a dose 
of Prevenar7. Infanrix hexa was used as the control vaccine and immunogenicity included pre-booster 
evaluation of antibody persistence.  
Study design 
The study was a PIII, randomized, active controlled, observer blind, multi-centre study as an extension of 
study A3L24. 
3 Groups were used: 
G1: Primary series Hexyon + Prevenar + Rotarix, Booster Hexyon + Prevenar 
G2: Primary series Hexyon + Prevenar + Rotarix, Booster Infanrix hexa + Prevenar 
G3: Primary series Infanrix hexa + Prevenar + Rotarix, Booster Hexyon + Prevenar 
Blood draws for immunogenicity was on D0 (pre-vaccination) and 30days post vaccination. 
Immediate reactions were collected for the 30 minutes post vaccination, solicited AEs over the first 7 
days, unsolicited over the first 30 days and SAEs during the complete study duration. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria are similar to the precursor study. 
Of note: Due to national immunization recommendations an additional dose of MMRV and/or yellow fever 
vaccine was given optionally during the trial.

* Two phone calls or home visits will be arranged between 2 to 3 days and 8 to 10 days after vaccine administration to ensure completion of the subject’s DC. 
Parent(s)/guardian(s) are advised to call the site if any unusual medical event occurs. 
† MMR,V: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella 
‡ Since completion of A3L24 study   
** Booster Vaccination: all subjects previously vaccinated at 2, 4 and 6 months of age with DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T or Infanrix hexa will receive one dose of 
DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T or Infanrix hexa, concomitantly with a booster dose of Prevenar (PCV7). 
§ For subjects in Costa Rica 
Reminder of content of study A3L24 (Excerpt from EPAR) 
This study has been conducted in 1376 Latin American infants. It was a multicentre and multi-national 
randomized and observer blind trial. The trial had 4 arms with three arms being different lots of Hexyon 
and the fourth arm Infanrix hexa. All groups received Prevenar and Rotarix concomitantly with the 
hexavalent vaccines. The hexavalent vaccines and Prevenar were given at 2, 4 and 6 months of age, 
Rotarix at 2 and 4 months. Blood was drawn from all subjects prior to dose 1 and one month after the third 
dose of Hexyon or Infanrix hexa. In a subset of 242 infants (drawn equally from all groups, ~60 per 
group) there was an additional blood draw for anti-RV antibodies one month after the second Rotarix 
dose. Anti-pneumococcal antibodies were measured one month after the third dose also only in a subset 
of 481 infants, again equally selected from all groups (~120 per group); the antigens contained in the 
hexavalent vaccines were measured in all infants.  
The subjects were followed-up for 6 months after the last vaccination.  
Study subjects had to be healthy, term born infants with a birth weight of >2,5 kg. Informed consent had 
to be given by at least one parent or other legal representative. Not permitted were multiple trial 
participation, known hypersensitivities to vaccine substances, severe chronical illness (including 
neurological) or the need for blood products or systemic immune modulators as well as prior infection with 
one of the bacteria/viruses included in the vaccines.

The infants had already received one dose of BCG and HepB according to local immunization calendar. 
Outcomes: 
Overall, endpoints, conduct, and general outline of the study were adequate to demonstrate equivalence 
between the three lots of Hexyon and non-inferiority of the immune response to Hexyon versus Infanrix 
hexa. This is demonstrated for seroprotection and seroconversion levels as well as for GMT-thresholds of 
short- and long-term protection for all antigens of the hexavalent vaccines. 
Seroconversion and GMTs against the different serotypes of Prevenar 7 are also very similar between the 
vaccination groups except for serotype 14 that shows a statistically though not clinically significantly 
lower value for the concomitant use with Hexyon versus Infanrix hexa. 
Likewise, no clinically relevant differences were observed in Rotarix immunogenicity responses when 
co-administered with Hexyon or Infanrix hexa. GMTs and seroprotection rates in this study were similar 
to that known from approval studies where Rotarix had been administered without a concomitant vaccine. 
There was no non-inferiority analysis made for concomitant use with the two hexavalent vaccines. Neither 
were the concomitant versus single use with both hexavalent vaccines part of this trial. Nevertheless, this 
study does not show any negative effect of the concomitant use of Hexyon with Prevenar and Rotarix for 
the immune response against any of the vaccines’ antigens. 
Assessor’s comment 
General study outline as well as inclusion and exclusion criteria are acceptable.

Assessor’s comment on objectives and endpoints 
The use of accepted correlates of protection is appropriate. 
The definitions of (S)AEs are according to ICH E2A and cover essential time-points. For convenience and 
comparability digital thermometers and flexible centimetre rulers were handed out along with the Diary 
cards, temperature measurements were to be made axillary. The safety observations were thus according 
to standard in vaccine studies conducted in the EU. 
Statistical analysis 
Descriptive statistics were produced: 
•  Safety data at each time point were summarized by vaccine groups. 
• 
Immunogenicity endpoints were presented by vaccine groups including stratification on the age 
at inclusion. The following parameters were used: 
o  For Ab persistence (pre-booster dose administration): 
  Geometric mean (GM) of Ab titers 
 
Percentage of subjects with Ab titers above predefined thresholds 
o  For booster response (post-booster administration) 
  GM of Ab titers 
  GM of individual Ab titers ratio post/pre-booster dose (GM of titers ratio 
calculated for all antigens, except for Prevenar [PCV7] antigens) 
 
Percentage of subjects with titers above predefined thresholds 
  Seroconversion rate for PT and FHA antigens 
  Booster response rate for PT and FHA antigens 
Subjects of Costa Rica who had participated at the National Campaign of Intensification against Polio with 
standalone oral poliovirus serotypes vaccine before inclusion in this trial were not included in the 
descriptive analysis of poliovirus 1, 2 and 3 antigens on the perprotocol analysis set for the main analysis. 
Reverse cumulative curves for each antigen were presented. 
The main safety and immunogenicity parameters were described with 95% confidence interval (CI). 
No sample size calculation was done. 
A total of 1376 subjects were enrolled in study A3L24. A maximum of 1376 subjects were to be included 
in study A3L27 and analyzed for safety and immunogenicity. 
Assessor’s comment 
The statistical methods used for this trial’s endpoints are in line with the other studies submitted for the 
initial opinion.

The assays and test reagents used are the same as for the primary vaccination study A3L24 in the same 
subjects. 
Protocol Amendments and other major changes 
There were 3 relevant changes made to the protocol and concerning the conduct of the trial: 
•  MMRV and YF-vaccination were added as per local requirement in Costa Rica 
•  A fifth dose of PCV was added as per local requirement in Costa Rica 
• 
The statistical analysis was planned to have 2 steps, in the end only one – the end-analysis -  was 
performed.

Table 6 and Table 7 show the persistence of the antibodies post dose three for the surrogate and 
correlates of protection (Table 6) as well as the GMTs (Table 7) for all antigens included in the hexavalent 
vaccines. Data from D140 derive from study A3L24 (MAH statement in study report page 145:” values 
calculated from data from the A3L24 primary series”). 
Diphtheria 
Short-term protection threshold (≥0,01 IU/mL) was still fulfilled for nearly all subjects prior to the 
booster, long-term threshold (≥0,1 IU/mL) for 30-40% of all subjects with only minor differences 
between the groups. After the booster dose all subjects reached the long-term protection threshold. 
GMTs were similar for all groups at the different time-points.

Tetanus 
Short-term protection threshold (≥0,01 IU/mL) was still fulfilled for nearly all subjects prior to the 
booster, long-term threshold (≥0,1 IU/mL) still for 70% of all subjects with only minor differences 
between the groups. After the booster dose all subjects reached the long-term protection threshold. 
GMTs were similar for all groups at the different time-points except for group 3 (Infanrix Hexa primed, 
Hexyon booster) that showed statistically significantly higher GMT (7,52 vs. 5,21 or 5,72 in the Hexyon 
primed groups). This difference is not considered clinically important as the thresholds are still met. 
Hib (PRP) 
Short-term protection threshold (≥0.15 µg /mL) was still fulfilled for ~70% of the subjects prior to the 
booster, long-term threshold (≥1 µg/mL) for ~30% of all subjects with only minor differences between 
the groups. After the booster dose all subjects reached the long-term protection threshold. Although the 
GMTs were not statistically different between the groups, group3 that had the lowest GMT after the 
priming with Infanrix hexa now shows the highest GMT after the Booster with Hexyon. Again, these 
differences are not considered clinically important. 
Pertussis 
A sufficient booster response (4-fold increase) after the booster was seen for both PT and FHA. 
PT GMTs show that prior to the booster the GMTs have sunken from ~100 EU/ml across all groups to 
about 8 EU/ml across all groups. Due to the booster dose GMTs then reach values of 140-150 EU/ml with 
the significantly highest result of 191 UE/ml for group2 (Priming Hexyon, Booster Infanrix hexa). 
FHA GMTs show that prior to the booster the GMTs have sunken from ~180-190 EU/ml across the two 
Hexon-primed groups (G1 + G2) and 120 for group 3 to about 14-23 EU/ml across all groups. Due to the 
booster dose GMTs then reach values of 260 EU/ml in group 3 and significantly higher results of 316 
EU/ml for group 1 (Priming Hexyon, Booster Hexyon) and 418 EU/ml for group 2 (Priming Hexyon, 
Booster Infanrix hexa). Confidence intervals are not overlapping (reddened cells in Table 7). The clinical 
relevance of this observance (in absence of a definite threshold) can only be guessed in so far as a higher 
titre would be preferable. Nevertheless, given the rapid deterioration of Pertussis-antigen titres the 
differences observed are judged negligible. 
Hepatitis B 
Details on seroprotection rates can be seen in Table 6 above. Development of anti HBs response 
exceeding 10 mlU/mL is general accepted as a correlate for protective immunity against hepatitis, 
whereas 100 mlU/mL is the more conservative threshold. 
Prior to the booster vaccination nearly all subjects were still seroprotected. The percentage of subjects 
with antibody titers above the threshold of 10mlU/mL was similar in the three groups with a range from 
97.5% in group 1 to 99.2% in group 3. For the more conservative threshold seroprotection rates also 
were similar in the three groups with ranges from 82.2% (group 3) to 85.2% (group 2). Post-booster 
seroprotection rates were nearly 100% and equivalent for the three groups. 99.7% of subjects in group 
1 and 99.5% of subjects in group 2 reached the threshold of 10 mlU/mL, in group 3 100% of subjects 
reached that threshold. The more conservative threshold was reached by 97.7% of subjects in group 1 
and 2 and 99.2% of subjects in group 3, which is similar for the 3 groups.  
Please see details on GMTs for hepatitis B virus in Table 7 above. GMTs have sunken about factor 10 after 
primary vaccination. The pre-and post-booster GMTs were of the same order of magnitude in all 3 groups 
Assessment report under Article 46  
EMA/725531/2014

ranging from 336 (group 3) to 406 (group 2) pre-booster and 8462 (group 1) to 11218 (group 2) 
post-booster. 
Taking together over 97% of all subjects were seroprotected with antibody titers ≥10 mIU/mL prior to the 
booster vaccination. The percentage of subjects with protective antibody titers was similar for the 3 
groups. Immune response after booster vaccination was equivalent for the 3 groups with similar GMTs 
and seroprotection rates. Subjects following booster vaccination with Hexyon/Hexaxaim concomitant 
with Prevenar experienced a sufficient anti Hepatitis B immune response, regardless if the priming was 
done with Infanrix hexa or Hexaxim/Hexyon. 
Polio 
Details on seroprotection rates for the different polio virus types are given in Table 6 above. For polio 
types 1, 2 and 3 prior to the booster vaccination nearly all subjects were still seroprotected. Overall about 
98% of all subjects presented antibody titers ≥ 8 (1/dil), the established correlate of protection The 
seroprotection rate was similar for the 3 groups, with ranges from 98.2% (group 2) to 98.8% (group 1) 
for anti-polio 1, from 99.4% (group 1) to 100% (group 2 and 3) for anti-polio 2, and from 94.8% (group 
2) to 99.1% (group3) foranti- polio 3. After the booster vaccination all subjects were seroprotected 
against all poliovirus types, seroprotection rate was 100% in all 3 groups. 
GMT values for the 3 poliovirus types can be seen in Table 7 above. Pre-and post-booster GMTs were 
higher for all 3 poliovirus types in group 3, primed with Infanrix hexa than in group 1 and group 2, primed 
with the investigational product Hexyon. This difference in GMTs was statistically significant for all 
parameters in group 3 compared to group 1 and except for the pre-booster GMT for poliovirus type 2 and 
post-booster GMT for poliovirus type 1 statistically significant in group 3 compared to group 2. However 
the achieved GMTs were high in all 3 groups and far exceeded the threshold of ≥ 8 (1/dil) so that the 
effect of higher GMTs in group 3 is not considered of clinical relevance. 
In summary booster vaccination with Hexaxim/Hexyon concomitant with Prevenar induced a sufficient 
immune response against all 3 poliovirus types regardless if the priming has been done with Infanrix hexa 
or Hexaxim/Hexyon. 
Effect of One Additional Oral Dose of Standalone Poliovirus Vaccine 
From 2 to 27 May 2011, the Ministry of Health of Costa Rica and the Costa Rican Social Security 
Institution scheduled a National Campaign of Intensification against Polio with OPV. The Polio campaign 
took place between completion of vaccinations on the primary series study (A3L24) and previous the 
initiation of the booster vaccination (A3L27). The effect of this additional dose of poliovirus vaccine in the 
immune responses to poliovirus serotypes 1, 2 and 3 in Costa Rica was therefore added as an 
observational objective. Subjects of Costa Rica who had participated at the National Campaign of 
Intensification against Polio with standalone oral poliovirus serotypes vaccine before inclusion in this trial 
were not included in the descriptive analysis of poliovirus 1, 2 and 3 antigens on the per protocol analysis 
set for the main analysis 
Please find details on seroprotection rates and GMT values in the final clinical study report Table 9.70 to 
Table 9.77, page 451 to page 502. Exemplarily overall GMTs can be seen in Table 11 above. Prior to 
booster vaccination GMTs were significant higher in subjects with an additional OPV dose (5 doses of 
poliovirus vaccine altogether) than in subjects without (4 doses of poliovirus vaccine altogether). GMT 
ranged from 468 for poliovirus type 3 to 1403 for poliovirus type 2 in subjects with an additional poliovirus

vaccination and from 171 for poliovirus type 1 to 358 for poliovirus type 2 in subjects without an 
additional vaccination. However all pre-booster GMTs in subjects without an additional OPV vaccination 
exceeded the threshold of ≥ 8 (1/dil) and were equivalent for all 3 groups. After booster vaccination the 
GMTs were high and far exceeded the threshold of ≥ 8 (1/dil). The results regarding post-booster GMT 
values were similar for subjects with 4 doses compared to the subjects receiving 5 doses of poliovirus 
vaccination and equivalent for the 3 groups.  
Pre- and post-booster seroprotection rates were similar for subjects with and without an additional 
poliovirus vaccination and for the three groups. Overall seroprotection rates can be seen in Table 
12.above. Overall prior to the booster vaccination nearly all subjects were seroprotected. The overall 
pre-booster seroprotection rates in subjects without an additional OPV vaccination was more than 97% 
with ranges from 97.3% (poliovirus type 3) to 99.5% (poliovirus type 2). Overall pre-booster 
seroprotection rates for subjects who received an additional dose of poliovirus vaccine ranged from 
99.3% for poliovirus type 1 to 100% for poliovirus type 2 and 3. Post-booster the seroprotection rate was 
100% for all subjects in all groups against all poliovirus types.  
Taking together there was no beneficial effect of an additional dose of oral polio vaccine administered 
between primary and booster vaccination with Hexyon/Hexaxima regarding seroprotection against any of 
the three poliovirus types or the GMTs. From the data presented the impact of the additional OPV 
vaccination on the Hexaxim/Hexyon valences cannot be assessed as there is no comparison of the 
Costa-Rican versus the other sites.  
Pneumococcal serotypes in concomitant use with the two hexavalent vaccines 
Table 8 shows that nearly all subjects reached the predefined threshold of ≥0,35 µg/ml after the booster 
dose regardless of which hexavalent vaccine has been concomitantly used for priming or booster. Table 
9 shows the respective titres to be very similar with overlapping CIs. 
Prophylactic use of antipyretics 
Table 10 shows the comparison of both prime-booster combinations with and without prophylactic (-6h to 
12h post booster) or later use (>12h post booster) of antipyretics in respect to the antigens contained in 
the hexavalent vaccines. In almost all cases the use of (prophylactic) antipyretics did not change the 
GMTs significantly. Only for the anti-PRP antibodies there is a statistically significant difference in GMTs in 
the prophylactic use regarding the combination of the hexavalent vaccines: subjects primed and 
boostered with Hexyon show a significantly lower GMT (32.3 [22.5;46.5]) than subjects primed with 
Infanrix hexa and boostered with Hexyon (67.1 [49.4;91.2]). Nevertheless, although a slight difference 
regarding the threshold of long-term protection can also be seen (97.1 [90.1;99.7] versus 100 
[94.4;100]) it is not statistically significant (Table 9.69 of the study protocol, data not shown in this AR). 
Thus, the observed difference is of doubtful clinical significance. 
For hepatitis B GMTs in group 1 (priming and booster vaccination with Hexyon) and group 3 (priming with 
Infanrix hexa, booster vaccination with Hexyon) were lower for subjects with antipyretic use in the 6 
hours preceding the booster vaccination and 12 hours after vaccination than in subjects with no 
antipyretic use and subjects with antipyretic use more than 12hours after vaccination. Group 1 5138 
versus 9389 and 10544 respectively, group 3 7686 versus 10189 and 12642 respectively. GMTs for the 3 
poliovirus types in group 1 were also lower for subjects with antipyretic use in the 6 hours preceding the 
Assessment report under Article 46

booster vaccination and 12 hours after vaccination than in subjects with no antipyretic use and subjects 
with antipyretic use more than 12 hours after vaccination. In group 3 GMTs for subjects with antipyretic 
use more than 12 hours after vaccination were the lowest. For the detailed GMT values please also see 
Table 10 above. 
Overall GMTs for hepatitis B and the 3 poliovirus types were high for all subjects and the observed 
differences were not statistically relevant. Therefore the findings seem not be of clinical relevance.

Overall, the rate and severity of adverse events and reactions is similar between the groups (Table 13). No grade 3 solicited or unsolicited reactions were seen 
(Table 16) with nasopharingitis the most common AE within the first 30 days after the vaccination. The rate of both  injection site and systemic reactions is very 
similar in all groups as can be seen in Table 14 and Table 15 with pain and irritability the most common reactions.  Also, there is no significant difference between 
the hexavalent-vaccine-arm and the Prevenar-arm (data not shown but included in study report). 
There were no deaths in this study. 
 “Extensive limb swelling”, that had been defined as a case of special interest, was also not seen in this study. 
Of the 38 SAEs that occurred during the complete study duration none were judged related to the vaccines:

One case of Kawasaki disease occurred 153 days post booster immunization with Hexyon, the child completely recovered and continued in the study. 
The febrile seizures that were seen were of similar rate in the three groups (G1:1, G2:2, G3:1) and all occurred 101d, 39d, 33d and 15d after the booster 
vaccinations. All children had concomitant infections, all recovered and continued in the trial.The most common other SAEs were infections not related to the 
vaccinations. The assessor concurs with the judgement that the SAEs seen were not related to the vaccinations.

3. Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
For antigens with correlates of protection all thresholds were met after the booster dose in all groups. 
Booster responses against Pneumococcal and Pertussis antigens were also equivalent in all groups. 
Booster vaccination with Hexaxim/Hexyon concomitant with Prevenar induced a sufficient immune 
response against all 3 poliovirus types regardless if the priming has been done with Infanrix hexa or 
Hexaxim/Hexyon. The higher GMTs seen in the group primed with Infanrix hexa are not considered of 
clinical relevance. 
Also booster responses against hepatitis B virus were equivalent in all study groups with similar 
seroprotection rates and GMTs. 
There was no effect on seroprotection rates or GMTs for any of the 3 poliovirus types regarding subjects 
with an additional dose of poliovirus vaccine compared to subjects who did not receive this additional 
vaccination. 
The lower GMTs for hepatitis B in subjects with prophylactic antipyretic use in the 6 hours preceding the 
booster vaccination and 12 hours after vaccination are deemed not to be of clinical relevance. 
Regarding GMTs minor differences were seen for Tetanus, Hib and Pertussis (FHA only) but are judged of 
negligible clinical effect. The same holds true for the observed lower anti-PRP GMT in the group using only 
Hexyon with antipyretics used as prophylactic. 
Safety assessment shows equivalence of the rate and severity of AEs in all groups. No deaths occurred in 
this study. The SAEs seen were all unrelated to the vaccinations and none of the cases of special interest 
were seen in the study. 
There is no text change necessary for the common English SmPC but it was seen that at least the German 
translation – which included the term “Grundimmunisierung” [primary vaccination] in the concomitant 
use text regarding pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugated vaccine (PCV7) – needs to be amended.  
Recommendation  
  Fulfilled –  
The MAH is requested to amend the German translation of the product information in the next 
upcoming procedure affecting the Annexes as follows:  
4.5 Wechselwirkungen mit anderen Arzneimitteln und sonstige Wechselwirkungen 
Daten über die zeitgleiche Verabreichung von Hexyon mit einem 
Pneumokokken-Polysaccharid-Konjugatimpfstoff zeigten bei der Grundimmunisierung keine klinisch 
relevante Beeinträchtigung der Antikörperantwort auf die einzelnen Antigene. 
Reason: The German translation mentions the non-interference at the time-point of primary vaccination 
only. The English original does not include the term, thus, needs not to be amended with the new data 
from the booster. Whether this change is also necessary for other languages should be checked.

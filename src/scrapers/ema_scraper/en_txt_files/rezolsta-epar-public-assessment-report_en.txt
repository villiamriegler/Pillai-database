2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Protease inhibitors (such as Darunavir) have been part of antiretroviral regimens for more than  a 
decade with adequate virologic suppression and high barrier to resistance. They are combined with a 
pharmacokinetic  enhancer,  ritonavir  (rtv  100  mg),  to  increase  plasma  exposure.    No  fixed  dose 
combination  (FDC)  of  a  protease  inhibitor  and  its  pharmacoenhancer  is  available,  which  would 
increase simplicity and reduce medication errors. A new pharmaco-enhancer Cobicistat (COBI) has 
been developed and is to be combined with CYP3A dependent antiretroviral agents; elvitegravir (an 
integrase inhibitor), atazanavir and darunavir (both protease inhibitors).  
The current application concerns a ‘substitution indication’ of a fixed dose combination of DRV 800 mg 
and COBI 150 mg. Both components have been registered. Darunavir (DRV; “PREZISTA”) 800 mg 
once daily (qd) has been registered with another pharmaco-enhancer, ritonavir 100 mg, for the 
indication: ‘PREZISTA, co-administered with low dose ritonavir is indicated in combination with other 
antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of patients with human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV-1) infection. 
PREZISTA 400mg and 800 mg tablets may be used to provide suitable dose regimens for the 
treatment of HIV-1 infection in adult and paediatric patients from the age of 12 years and at least 40 
kg body weight who are: 
• 
antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve (see section 4.2). 
•  ART-experienced with no darunavir resistance associated mutations (DRV-RAMs) and who 
have plasma HIV-1 RNA < 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count ≥  100 cells x 106/l. In 
deciding to initiate treatment with PREZISTA in such ART-experienced patients, genotypic 
testing should guide the use of PREZISTA (see sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). 
COBI 150 mg (TYBOST) has been registered as a pharmaco-enhancer of DRV in 2013. With the 
current application the applicant submits data on a FDC of the two components and applies for the 
same indication for this FDC, DRV/COBI 800/150 mg qd as mentioned above for DRV/RTV 800/100 
mg qd. 
About the product 
The FDC of Rezolsta (DRV/COBI) 800/150 mg qd consists of two registered components: the 
antiretroviral agent DRV and a pharmaco-enhancer COBI. The single agents DRV and COBI have 
already been authorised for combined use at the same dose levels as in the FDC. 
DRV (previously designated as TMC114), is an HIV-1 protease inhibitor and is currently indicated for 
the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and in paediatric patients of 3 years of age and above, in 
combination with rtv and with other ARVs. Low-dose ritonavir is coadministered with DRV (as single 
agent) for its CYP3A inhibitor properties, in order to enhance (‘boost’) DRV systemic exposure. 
Darunavir obtained marketing authorisation in the European Union in February 2007 and is currently 
registered in more than 100 countries.  
Once daily and twice daily dosing recommendations of DRV/rtv are available.  
Assessment report  
EMA/669488/2014 Corr. 1 
Page 8/100 
  
  
The dose regimen DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily is recommended in ART-naïve adult patients and in 
ART-experienced adult patients with no DRV RAMs, who have plasma HIV-1 RNA <100,000 copies/mL 
and CD4+ cell count ≥ 100x106 cells/L. 
COBI, Cobicistat, (TYBOST, formerly known as GS-9350) is a new chemical entity developed by Gilead 
for use as a PK enhancer to increase systemic exposure of co-administered medicinal products 
metabolized by CYP3A enzymes, including the HIV-1InSTI elvitegravir (EVG) in a fixed dose 
combination Stribild. On 24 May 2013 this single tablet regimen (STR) EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF 
(STRIBILD) was granted marketing authorization by the European Commission for treatment of HIV-1 
infection in adults aged 18 years and over who are ART-naïve or are infected with HIV-1 without 
known mutations associated with resistance to any of the 3 ARV agents in STRIBILD. 
In addition, COBI is registered in the European Union on 25 July 2013 as a separate component to be 
combined with the HIV protease inhibitors atazanavir and darunavir. The current indication is: 
Cobicistat (TYBOST) is indicated as a pharmacokinetic enhancer of atazanavir 300 mg once daily or 
darunavir 800 mg once daily as part of antiretroviral combination therapy in human 
immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infected adults. 
COBI is a structural analogue of rtv and a potent, mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A. Cobicistat 
itself has no detectable antiviral activity against HIV-1 in vitro and does not directly contribute to the 
efficacy of an ARV regimen.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Darunavir ethanolate 
General information 
The  information  for  darunavir  reflects  the  currently  approved  active  substance  information  for 
Prezista tablets (EU/1/06/380/001-008) of the same applicant. 
The chemical name of Darunavir ethanolate is 
[(1S,2R)-3-[[(4-aminophenyl)sulfonyl](2-methylpropyl)amino]-2-hydroxy-1-(phenylmethyl) 
propyl]-carbamic acid (3R,3aS,6aR)-hexahydrofuro[2,3-b]furan-3-yl ester monoethanolate and has 
the following structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/669488/2014 Corr. 1 
Page 9/100 
  
  
Darunavir ethanolate is a white to off-white powder, very slightly soluble in aqueous solutions. This 
solubility increases with decreasing pH, but remains very slightly soluble in the pH region between 1 
and 12.  
Darunavir  ethanolate  exhibits  stereoisomerism  due  to  the  presence  of  five  chiral  centres. 
Enantiomeric  purity  is  controlled  routinely.  The  active  moiety  is  presented  in  the  solid  state  as  a 
pseudo-polymorph. Other solvates are also possible, but are not relevant as ethanol is the solvent 
used during the final manufacturing step in the chemical synthesis. An extensive polymorphism study 
was  performed.  Darunavir  ethanolate  was  isolated  either  as  a  solvate  crystalline  material  or  as 
non-solvated amorphous material. A non-solvated crystalline form was not obtained. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Darunavir ethanolate is synthesized in 4 main steps using commercially available well defined starting 
materials  with  acceptable  specifications.  The  manufacturing  process  is  the  same  as  described  for 
Prezista tablets. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on  chemistry  of  new  active  substances.  Potential  and  actual  impurities  were  well  discussed  with 
regards to their origin and characterised.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Specification 
Specifications,  analytical  procedures  and  validation  data  are  in  accordance  with  those  currently 
authorised  in  Prezista  MAA.  Darunavir  specification  includes  tests  for  identification  (IR,  HPLC),

Cobicistat 
General information 
The information for cobicistat reflects the currently approved active substance information for Tybost 
film –coated tablets (EU/1/13/872/001-2) of Gilead Sciences International Ltd. 
Cobicistat on silicon dioxide is defined as the active substance. It is isolated by adsorption of cobicistat 
onto silicon dioxide to provide a stable solid form, which facilitates handling and is suitable for further 
finished product processing. 
The chemical name of cobicistat is 1,3-Thiazol-5-ylmethyl 
[(2R,5R)-5-{[(2S)-2-[(methyl{[2-(propan-2-yl)-1,3-thiazol-4-yl]methyl}carbamoyl)amino]-4-(mor
pholin-4-yl)butanoyl]amino}-1,6-diphenylhexan-2-yl]carbamate (refer to cobicistat molecule) and 
has the following structure: 
Cobicistat on silicon dioxide is a white to pale yellow powder and is hygroscopic as determined by 
dynamic vapor sorption at room temperature. The intrinsic aqueous solubility of cobicistat free base 
is 75 µg/mL and is significantly enhanced under acidic conditions 
Cobicistat exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of three chiral centres. It is produced as a 
single isomer. The stereochemical configurations at these chiral centers are controlled through the 
synthetic process and use of starting materials having suitably high chiral purities Enantiomeric purity 
is controlled routinely. Cobicistat active substance is amorphous.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Cobicistat is synthesized in 4 main steps using commercially available well defined starting materials 
with  acceptable  specifications.  The  manufacturing  process  is  the  same  as  described  in  Tybost 
film-coated tablets MAA.

indicating. 
The parameters tested were appearance, assay, impurity content, chiral impurities and water 
content. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier(s) is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
This fixed dose combination was developed based on prior formulation experience with darunavir in 
Prezista, the inclusion of cobicistat, and the need to minimize tablet size while combining two active 
substances in one fixed dose combination film coated tablet was also studied during the 
pharmaceutical development. 
Daruvavir is currently authorised as active substance of Prezista and the excipients used for the fixed 
dose combination product were identical in terms of manufacturing and quality as the authorised 
active substance. The issue of the use of the ethanolate and the potential to change during 
manufacture or on storage was addressed with the Prezista formulations. The applicant showed that 
whilst the hydrate form is also possible, it has the same bioavailability as the ethanolate form. During 
stability studies ethanol content was monitored as a means of estimating potential conversion of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/669488/2014 Corr. 1 
Page 12/100 
  
  
ethanolate to hydrate and no significant changes were observed. Stereoisomeric purity of darunavir 
was also monitored during manufacture and on storage and no evidence of inter-conversion was 
found. 
Cobicistat is currently authorised The issue of the use of the cobicistat adsorbed onto an inert silicon 
dioxide carrier was addressed and accepted for the authorised formulations of cobicistat.  The 
amorphicity of the cobicistat was confirmed using x-ray diffraction during stability studies. No 
changes were observed in the finished product over the shelf-life. Stereoisomeric purity of cobicistat 
was also monitored during manufacture and on storage and no evidence of inter-conversion was 
found. 
Darunavir  is  a  very  slightly  soluble  in  aqueous  solutions  across  the  pH  range  of  1  to  12,  and  is 
administered  at  a  high  dose  (800-mg)  in  the  finished  product.  The  combination  of  low  aqueous 
solubility  and  high  dose  requires  the  use  of  surfactant  in  the  medium  to  enhance  solubility.  In 
contrast, the cobicistat solubility varies from soluble to practically insoluble depending on the pH, and 
cobicistat is administered at a lower dose (150 mg) in the finished product. The variable solubility 
range and lower dose for cobicistat enables sink conditions to be met without the use of surfactant. 
The finished product is formulated with commonly used pharmaceutical excipients typically employed 
in solid dosage forms that are manufactured via a granulation process. The excipients are described 
in detailed monographs in the Ph Eur and are generally recognized as safe. The stability of the active 
substances and their compatibility with the excipients was demonstrated in stability studies during 
development and is confirmed by the primary stability data included in this dossier. 
Several formulations were explored to optimize the inclusion of cobicistat, the filler used, and core 
tablet  weight.  Based  on  the  findings  from  these  experiments,  two  formulations  differing  in  filler 
composition  and  core  tablet  weight  were  evaluated  in  a  comparative  bioavailability  study.  A 
bioavailability study compared the formulations to coadministration of single agent darunavir tablets 
(provided  as  two,  400  mg  darunavir  tablets)  and  cobicistat  150  mg  tablets.  Darunavir  Cmax  and 
AUC24h  values  were  comparable  between  both  formulations.  Given  the  similarity  in  relative 
bioavailability results for both formulations, the formulation chosen for further development was the 
one which closely align with Prezista formulation and used the simplest finished product composition. 
The dissolution methods for the active substances were adequately developed and showed sufficient 
discriminative power. The use of surfactant for darunavir dissolution is justified based on the solubility 
of the substance. 
The development of the manufacturing process was based, in part, on the knowledge gained during 
the  development  and  manufacturing  of  the  authorised  Prezista.  The  fixed  dose  composition  is 
manufactured  by  fluid  bed  granulation  of  darunavir  with  a  binder  (hypromellose),  which  is  then 
blended  with  cobicistat  and  other  excipients  (silicified  microcrystalline  cellulose  and  povidone), 
followed by milling and blending with magnesium stearate. The final blend is compressed and tablets 
are film coated with non-functional coating. 
Designs  of  Experiments  (DoE)  studies  were  performed  after  primary  stability  batch  production  to 
establish the operating ranges for each process step. Material input variability was also examined to 
evaluate  the  impact  of  material  variations  that  would  be  expected  during  routine  production.  The 
Quality target product profile (QTPP), critical quality attributes (CQA’s), critical process parameters 
(called  critical  control  points)  of  the  steps  milling  and  blending,  sieving  and  final  blending, 
compression and film-coating was also provided. However, no formal risk assessment was performed 
to  link  material  attributes  and  process  parameters  to  finished  product  CQA’s.  No  design  space  is 
claimed. 
White, high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with child-resistant polypropylene (PP) closure with 
induction seal liner were selected as the container closure system based on the ability to adequately

protect the finished product throughout its shelf life. The HDPE bottle is a standard and widely used 
pharmaceutical container. The induction seal liner has been incorporated into the packaging design 
for seal integrity and as a tamper evident feature. The compatibility of the primary packaging 
materials of the container closure system with the finished product is demonstrated by the stability 
data. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of 8 main steps: preparation of binder solution, fluid bed 
granulation and drying, milling and blending, sieving and final blending, compression, preparation of 
the film-coating suspension, film coating and packaging. The process is considered to be a standard 
manufacturing process. 
A validation protocol was provided. The process validation activities for the tablets will be performed 
at the commercial manufacturing site for three batches at the commercial scale. The process 
validation batches were manufactured within the operating ranges according to the instructions listed 
in the manufacturing batch record. As well as performing the in-process tests, additional sampling 
procedures and in-process testing limits were performed during process validation. This was 
considered satisfactory.  
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form:  
appearance, identification darunavir (HPLC, NIR), identification cobicistat (HPLC, DAD), assay (HPLC), 
chromatographic purity related to darunavir (HPLC), chromatographic purity related to cobicistat 
(HPLC), uniformity of dosage unit (Ph Eur), dissolution, and microbiological purity (Ph Eur). 
Batch analysis results are provided for of five batches used for clinical bioavailability, bioequivalence, 
development, and/or stability studies confirms the consistency of the manufacturing process and its 
ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of 3 commercial scale batches of finished product stored under long term conditions for 
18 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH, for up 18 months under intermediate conditions at 30 °C/75% RH and 
for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines 
were provided. The batches are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the 
primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance, assay, purity, dissolution, ethanol content, water content, 
stereo-isomeric purity of darunavir and cobicistat (one batch of tablets), water activity, microbial 
purity and amorphicity of cobicistat. The stability test methods are the same as the release test 
methods. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
Two batches were included in an in-use stability study. The bottles were stored at 25 °C/60% RH and 
30 °C/75% RH. Initially 15 tablets were removed from the bottles. Then the bottles are opened 5 
days/week, 1 time/day without removal of a tablet during a period of 6 weeks. The remaining tablets 
are tested for appearance, assay, chromatographic purity, dissolution, ethanol, water, 
stereo-isomeric purity, amorphicity (of cobicistat) and microbiological purity. All results are within 
specification with only a small decrease of ethanol content and increase of water during the study. The 
Assessment report

in-use stability was performed at the beginning and will also be performed at 18 months and at 24 
months (the end of shelf-life). Bottles are regularly opened to simulate the daily use of the medication 
by the patient and to support the in-use shelf-life. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are 
acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product 
has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Darunavir 
Darunavir is a protease inhibitor. The inhibitory constant (Ki) for darunavir was <0.09 nM, which is 
comparable to lopinavir and lower than for other protease inhibitors.  Darunavir binds tightly to HIV-1 
protease to form highly stable complex with both wild type (Kd 4.5 x 10-12 M) and mutant proteases. 
In vitro antiviral activity was investigated in T-cell lines (MT4 and MT2 cells) infected with HIV-1, 
HIV-2, and SIV and in HIV-1 infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and human 
monocytes/macrophages. In T-cell lines, EC50 of darunavir was 2.29 – 6.26 nM against HIV-1, 4.70 
– 8.49 nM against HIV-2 and 9.28 nM against SIV. The EC50 values in HIV-1 infected human PBMCs 
and monocytes/macrophages were comparable to those observed in the T-cell lines. EC50 of 
darunavir increased by a median factor of 5.4 in the presence of 50% human serum. 
The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) was found to be greater than 100 μM. With a median EC50 
of 3.8 nM using the MTT assay in MT4 cells, a selectivity index (SI=CC50/EC50) >26000 was 
determined.

EMA/669488/2014 Corr. 1 
Page 15/100 
  
  
In vitro selection experiments with wild type HIV-1 isolates in the presence of increasing 
concentrations of darunavir revealed mutations at codons 37, 41, 55, 70, 71, 74, 77 and 85. From 7 
in vitro selection experiments starting with wild type HIV-1 strains, 3 resulted in emerging viruses 
with a fold change >4. Selection experiments with protease inhibitor-resistant HIV-1 revealed 22 
mutations, of which 11 not yet reported to be associated with resistance to proteases (L11I, I15V, 
G16E, L23I, S37N, L63P, V82I, T91A, T91S, Q92R, and L76V). A minimum of eight of the darunavir in 
vitro selection mutations were required in the HIV-1 protease to render a virus resistant to darunavir 
(fold change >10), from which at least 2 were already present in the baseline virus. Eighteen of 20 
protease inhibitor-resistant recombinant viruses were susceptible to darunavir (fold change ≤4). 
Among 3309 recombinant HIV-1 isolates with decreased susceptibility to at least one protease 
inhibitor, EC50 values were ≤10 nM for 78% of the isolates and >100 nM for 3% of the isolates. Eighty 
percent of the isolates exhibited a darunavir fold change of ≤4 and 10% of >10. 
Darunavir did not significantly inhibit human angiotensin converting enzyme, caspase 3, caspase 7, 
cathepsin C, cathepsin D, cathepsin E, factor VIIa, factor Xa, matrix metalloproteinase-2, matrix 
metalloproteinase-9, metalloproteinase neutral endopeptidase, thrombin, and renin. 
In vitro, hERG current was not inhibited (up to 10 μM, which is similar to 10-fold the human free 
maximum plasma level) and the cardiac action potential (sheep isolated cardiac Purkinje fibres) 
remained unaffected after 10 μM darunavir. In conscious telemetered beagle dogs, darunavir did not 
affect cardio-haemodynamic and ECG parameters at Cmax slightly higher and AUC values slightly lower 
than clinical exposure. At oral dose up to 2000 mg/kg in rats, darunavir did not show any effect on 
gastrointestinal transit time, neurobehavioral and motor activity, or respiration. Cmax was 
comparable to human exposure and AUC values were lower. 
Combinations with current antiretrovirals were studied in an anti-HIV-1/IIIB MT4 cell-based assay. 
The data indicate additivity with all nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, all tested 
non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. A modest synergistic effect with amprenavir, 
nelfinavir and ritonavir was observed whereas additive effects were described for the combination 
with atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, saquinavir, and tipranavir and with the fusion inhibitor 
enfuvirtide. 
Cobicistat 
Cobicistat is a structurally modified analogue of the protease inhibitor ritonavir, which is devoid of 
anti-retroviral activity. Cobicistat has been shown to inhibit the activity of human CYP3A enzymes 
(IC50 values 0.03 to 0.15 µM). Cobicistat or its metabolites M21, M26 and M31 did not have an 
inhibitory effect on HIV-1 protease at concentrations up to 30 µM. No antiviral activity was observed 
of cobicistat against two HIV-2 isolates.  
CC50 of cobicistat in MT2 lymphoblastoid T-cells and in HepG2 hepatoma cells was 89 µM and 44 µM 
respectively.  
Cobicistat showed significant binding to the benzothiazepine sensitive L-type calcium channel, hERG 
potassium channel and sodium channel, at a concentration of 10 μM, which is 105-fold higher than the 
proposed clinical Cmax (free).  
No effects were observed on the central nervous system in the rat at Cmax approximately 4.2-fold 
higher than that observed clinically. At higher doses (≥150 mg/kg), salivation along with decreased 
arousal, locomotor activity, motor activity and a decrease in body temperature were noted. No effects 
were observed on the respiratory system in the rat at doses up to 500 mg/kg. 
Cobicistat inhibited the hERG potassium current and the hCav1.2 L-type calcium channel, but was a 
weak inhibitor of the hNav1.5 sodium channel (with IC50 values of 1.8-1.9 μM, 6 μM and 86.5 μM, 
respectively). In the rabbit Purkinje fibre assay, cobicistat caused a significant shortening of action 
Assessment report  
EMA/669488/2014 Corr. 1 
Page 16/100 
  
  
 
potential duration at ≥ 1 µM (0.78 µg/mL, approximately 10-fold the clinical unbound exposure). In 
isolated rabbit heart, shortening of the monophasic action potential duration was also observed as 
well as an increase in coronary perfusion pressure and a decrease in ventricular function at 
concentrations ≥ 1-1.5 µM and decrease in the QT interval and increase in the PR and RR interval at 
≥3 µM. In vivo, no significant effect on QT interval was observed in the dog, following single oral doses 
of up to 45 mg/kg. Increases in PR interval were noted at ≥15 mg/kg where the plasma levels were 
reported to be 3.2 to 4.9 fold higher than that observed clinically. 
The potential for drug-drug interactions with cobicistat and clinically approved or investigational 
antiretroviral drugs was evaluated. The selected drugs were tenofovir, emtricitabine, abacavir, 
lamivudine, zidovudine, efavirenz, nevirapine, raltegravir, elvitegravir, atazanavir and darunavir. 
Overall, no significant changes were observed in the activity of any of the tested antiretroviral drugs 
in the presence of 5 μM cobicistat. 
Given that the use of atazanavir is associated with PR prolongation in man, that cobicistat also 
appears to increase PR interval (in vitro and in vivo), and that in man, cobicistat is to be used in 
combination with atazanavir (as part of an anti-retroviral treatment regimen), the effects of cobicistat 
(0.45 to 1.5 µM)/atazanavir (1.5 µM) were evaluated in the rabbit isolated heart. The effects on heart 
rate and PR interval appeared to be more pronounced when atazanavir (1.5 µM) and cobicistat (1.5 
µM) were administered in combination; however, the observed differences were not considered to be 
clinically significant. It is noted that during this study, cobicistat alone had no effect on the QT interval 
or monophasic action potential duration at up to 1.5 µM. 
Combination darunavir and cobicistat 
No studies were performed with the combination of darunavir and cobicistat. This was considered 
acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Darunavir 
In animals, darunavir absorption was rapid following oral administration in all species (Tmax 0.5 – 6 
hours). The absolute oral bioavailability was 37% to 58% in adult rats and 60 to 122% in dogs. In rats 
and dogs, the plasma clearance and the volume of distribution were moderate to high. Plasma kinetics 
of darunavir were less than dose proportional in all investigated species, especially at high dose 
levels. In adult rodents including pregnant rats, repeated oral dosing resulted in a decrease in 
systemic exposure, mainly due to induction of CYP3A iso-enzymes, which are extensively involved in 
the metabolism of darunavir. In dogs, no decrease in exposure or enzymatic induction was observed 
after repeated administration. 
Darunavir exposure (plasma, brain, and liver concentration) was much higher in juvenile rats (aged 
12 or 26 days) probably due to incomplete maturation of the blood-brain barrier and liver enzymes 
involved in the elimination of darunavir. It was nonetheless lower on day 26 than on day 12, 
presumably reflecting the development of drug metabolising enzymes and the blood-brain barrier. 
The plasma protein binding was moderate to high in all tested species and was concentration 
dependent. At 0.5 μg/ml, plasma protein binding ranged from 63 % in rabbits to 95 % in rats. In 
human the plasma protein binding was relative constant (
 94%) up to a concentration of 4.7 μg/ml, 
whereas about 75% was bound at 18.8 μg/ml. The blood to plasma concentration ratios ranged from 
0.64 to 1.11 across all species at 0.5 µg/mL, indicating some distribution of darunavir to blood cells, 
∼
especially in the rabbit and dog in which the plasma protein binding was lower than in the other 
species After oral administration of 14C-darunavir in rats, the tissue distribution of 14C-darunavir was 
Assessment report  
EMA/669488/2014 Corr. 1 
Page 17/100 
  
  
 
extensive and rapid. The highest concentrations of radioactivity were measured in the liver and 
adrenal gland. No undue retention or accumulation was observed, except in melanin-rich tissues such 
as the pigmented parts of the eye. However, from these tissues a gradual decrease of the radioactivity 
levels could be demonstrated, showing the reversibility of this binding. Darunavir crossed the 
placenta in pregnant rats, with levels of radioactivity found in foetuses being about 20% of that in 
maternal blood. 
The metabolism of darunavir following single oral administration was extensive and qualitatively 
similar in all species, including humans. In vitro and in vivo studies in rats, dogs and humans 
identified three major Phase I metabolic reactions: carbamate hydrolysis, aliphatic hydroxylation at 
the isobutyl moiety and aromatic hydroxylation at the aniline moiety. In dogs and humans, the major 
Phase I metabolic pathway was the carbamate hydrolysis whereas in rats, hydroxylation in a different 
part of the molecule was more important. Phase II glucuronidation was a minor pathway in rats, dogs 
and humans. No unique human metabolites were identified. In human liver, CYP3A was almost 
exclusively involved in the metabolism of darunavir. Darunavir inhibited CYP3A in human liver 
microsomes with an inhibitory constant (Ki) value of 0.40 μM (0.22 μg/mL). In mice and rats, 
darunavir treatment induced hepatic microsomal CYP3A4. UDP-GT activity was additionally induced in 
rats. In dogs, no induction effects were observed. 
Following a single dose in rats, most radioactivity was excreted within 24 h and was almost complete 
in 96 h. In all examined species, the predominant route of excretion for 14C-darunavir was via the 
feces (94% in rats, 86% in dogs and 82% in humans). Urinary excretion was about 4% of the 
administered dose in rats and dogs but was higher (12.2%) in humans. Unchanged darunavir was 
mainly excreted in feces and amounted to up to 12.3% in rats, 26% in dogs and 6.8% in humans. In 
plasma, unchanged compound accounted for the largest fraction of the radioactivity in the 3 species. 
In rats, darunavir was excreted in milk with milk to plasma AUC ratios up to 2.3 in dams.  
Six anti-HIV compounds were investigated for inhibitory effects in human liver microsomes. The 
results showed that saquinavir and amprenavir are predicted to be minor to moderate inhibitors of 
darunavir metabolism in vivo, whereas delavirdine, ritonavir, indinavir and nelfinavir are likely to be 
strong inhibitors. 
Darunavir inhibits P-gp and may therefore inhibit transepithelial permeation of P-gp substrates. 
Cobicistat 
Clearance values were high relative to hepatic blood flow and volumes of distribution were similar to 
those for total body water. After oral dosing, bioavailability was low or low/moderate (33%, 11% and 
7% in rat, dog and monkey resp.), likely due to high first-pass elimination. After repeated oral dosing, 
there were species differences in autoinduction during these studies, with hepatic microsomal 
fractions from treated mice and rats showing higher levels of CYP3A, but with no increases in treated 
dogs.  
Binding of cobicistat in plasma was moderately high. Fraction unbound values were similar in 
nonclinical species (mean values 4.75%-6.54%) to humans (6.3%). Cobicistat does not distribute 
well into the cellular fraction of blood from mouse, rat, dog, or human. 
After oral administration of 14C-cobicistat to albino and pigmented rats, radioactivity was rapidly and 
widely distributed to most tissues. Generally, the radioactivity was preferentially distributed into 
glandular tissues and organs of elimination. The tissues showing the highest concentrations of 
radioactivity, excluding the gastro intestinal tract, included liver, adrenal, kidney, and pituitary. The 
tissues with the lowest Cmax values were eye, spinal cord, and brain, bone, and secondary sex organs. 
In rats, cobicistat was shown to be associated with melanin. Dosimetry analysis confirmed that 
concentrations were declining and that this association was reversible. 
Assessment report  
EMA/669488/2014 Corr. 1 
Page 18/100 
  
  
 
The primary metabolic pathways for cobicistat are methine oxidation of the isopropyl moiety (M31, 
GS-9612), cleavage adjacent to the methylurea (M26, GS-341842), cleavage of the carbamate (M21, 
GS-9454), and cleavage and deethylation of the morpholine (M39). Combinations of these routes and 
other routes of oxidative metabolism were also detected. Oxidation is primarily catalyzed by CYP3A, 
which can generate all metabolites, with a minor role for CYP2D6 (which contributes to the generation 
of M31). Cobicistat is a potent inhibitor of human CYP3A with inactivation kinetics similar to those of 
ritonavir. Inhibition of CYP3A is relatively specific as cobicistat did not inhibit human CYP1A2, CYP2C9, 
or CYP2C19, is a very weak inhibitor of CYP2C8 (IC50 30.1 µM), a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 (IC50 9.2 
µM), and a modest inhibitor of CYP2B6 (IC50 2.8 µM). Cobicistat is a weak inhibitor of human hepatic 
microsomal UGT1A1 activity (IC50 16.3 µM).  
After oral administration of 14C-cobicistat to mice, rats, and dogs, recovery of radioactivity was high 
with the majority being found in feces. Recovery was largely complete by 48 hours post-dose. After 
oral administration of 14C-cobicistat to bile duct cannulated animals, an average of 69.3% and 63.9% 
of dosed radioactivity was recovered in bile in rats and dogs, respectively.  Cobicistat was present in 
milk samples 2 hours post dose on lactation day 10 with milk to plasma ratios ranging from 1.3 to 1.9. 
With respect to hepatic uptake transporters, cobicistat is a moderate inhibitor of OATP1B1 and 
OATP1B3. Cobicistat is a weak inhibitor of intestinal efflux transporters; however, high concentrations 
of cobicistat in the intestinal lumen, which are achievable briefly during absorption, may inhibit MDR1 
(P-gp) and BCRP. Cobicistat inhibits the renal efflux transporter, novel organic cation transporter 1. 
Cobicistat is also an in vitro inhibitor of the renal transporters, OCT2 and MATE1. 
Combination darunavir and cobicistat 
No non-clinical studies were performed with the combination of darunavir and cobicistat. This was 
considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Studies were performed with oral administration. 
Darunavir 
Due to a more rapid clearance in animals, the maximum achieved exposure to darunavir in animal 
studies was low compared to the human therapeutic level, and adding ritonavir could not much 
further enhance it. Likely, this difference was caused by the fact that ritonavir is a much stronger 
inhibitor of CYP3A4 in humans than in animals. 
In single dose toxicity studies, darunavir was well tolerated in mice at oral doses up to 100 mg/kg. 
Treatment related mortality and macroscopic findings (distended or fluid-filled gastro-intestinal 
tracts) occurred at oral doses ≥ 280 mg/kg. In rats, no treatment-related mortality or toxicologically 
relevant observations were observed at oral doses up to approximately 500 mg/kg. Also higher doses 
were investigated, but systemic exposure did not increase significantly beyond that observed at 500 
mg/kg. In dogs, the maximum tolerated dose was 75 mg/kg, with vomiting being the limiting adverse 
effect. 
Repeated dose studies in mice were performed for 2 weeks and 3 months. No NOAELs were 
established, but changes were minimal. Rat studies were performed up to 6 months, with darunavir 
alone or in combination with ritonavir. Darunavir alone induced an increase in the red blood cell (RBC) 
turnover, indicated by a limited decrease in RBC counts, increases in reticulocytes and bilirubin and 
extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen. Also observed were prolonged APTT, without evidence of 
bleeding, increases in platelets, and liver and thyroid changes which were associated with liver

EMA/669488/2014 Corr. 1 
Page 19/100 
  
  
 
 
enzyme induction and an enhanced metabolism of thyroid hormones. Effects of the combination of 
darunavir and ritonavir in rats were similar to the effects seen with each compound alone, with 
evidence of a small increase in effect on RBC parameters, liver and thyroid. In the liver, increases in 
liver transaminase activities, centrilobular hypertrophy accompanied by multinucleated hepatocytes 
and some single cell necrosis were observed. The transaminase increases were associated with 
ritonavir rather than darunavir. In addition, histopathological changes (increased incidence/severity 
of islet fibrosis/siderocytes in males) were observed in the pancreas. In dog studies with darunavir 
(up to 12 months duration), limited effects were observed in the liver (hepatocellular pigment and 
vacuolation and a limited increase in alkaline phosphatase, up to 45%). Dogs did not tolerate the 
combination of darunavir and ritonavir (vomiting, reduced body weight) and this combination was 
only investigated up to 2 weeks.  
Darunavir was not genotoxic in the Ames test, in the in vitro chromosomal aberration test in human 
lymphocytes and in an in vivo mouse micronucleus test.  
Darunavir was evaluated for carcinogenic potential by oral gavage administration to mice and rats up 
to 24-months. Daily doses up to 1000 mg/kg were administered to mice and doses up to 500 mg/kg 
were administered to rats. A dose-related increase in the incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and 
carcinomas was observed in males and females of both species. Thyroid follicular cell adenomas were 
noted in male rats. Administration of darunavir did not cause a statistically significant increase in the 
incidence of any other benign or malignant neoplasm in mice or rats. The observed liver and thyroid 
tumours were associated with liver enzyme induction and are considered not relevant to humans.  
There was no effect of darunavir on fertility or early embryonic development in rats. Embryo-foetal 
development studies were performed in rats, rabbits and mice. In mice, embryo-foetal development 
was also investigated in combination with ritonavir, to increase exposure to darunavir. Darunavir was 
not embryotoxic or teratogenic in rats, rabbits or mice. The exposure was low and did not exceed the 
human therapeutic exposure. In the pre- and postnatal development study in rats, darunavir caused 
a reduction in pup body weight gain, especially during lactation but also post-weaning. A slight delay 
was observed in the opening of the eyes and ears. Juvenile toxicity studies in rats with age ranging 
from 5 days up to sexual maturity at 50 days showed that exposure in juvenile rats younger than 23 
days of age was higher than in adult rats. Toxicity seemed also higher at age lower than 23 days. In 
animals aged 23-50 days, toxicity was not higher than in adult animals. In studies where dosing 
commenced at less than 23 days of age (equivalent to less than 2 years of age in humans), a NOAEL 
was not established. Mortality was observed at most dose levels (from 20 mg/kg/day up to 
1000 mg/kg/day) and in some cases convulsions and other apparent central nervous system effects 
preceded these deaths. High plasma, liver and brain exposure values were observed, which were both 
dose- and age-dependent and considerably greater than those observed in adult rats. These findings 
were attributed to the ontogeny of CYP liver enzymes involved in the metabolism of darunavir and the 
immaturity of the blood brain barrier. 
Local tolerance studies showed no skin irritation or eye irritation. Darunavir showed no potential for 
sensitization in the local lymph node assay in mice. 
No immunotoxicity was observed in a T-cell dependent antibody response test in rats after 
administration of darunavir at exposures which were similar to or just below human exposures 
(highest dose 500 mg/kg). Also in combination with ritonavir (100/50 mg/kg) no immunotoxicity was 
observed (exposure of darunavir below human exposure). 
Cobicistat 
The single-dose toxicity of cobicistat was low; the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 100 mg/kg in 
mice (moribund euthanasia occurred at 300 mg/kg), and the NOAEL was 500 mg/kg in rats.

Repeated dose studies in mice were performed up to 13 weeks. Increased liver weight, hepatocellular 
hypertrophy and vacuolation were observed and considered due to enzyme induction. Rat studies 
were performed up to 6 months. Reversible changes were observed in liver and thyroid which were 
associated with microsomal enzyme induction. Hematological changes (not exceeding 10% versus 
controls) included slightly lower mean values for erythrocyte count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean 
corpuscular volume, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and slightly higher mean platelet counts. 
Serum chemistry changes observed after 13 and/or 26 weeks of dosing included slightly higher mean 
gamma glutamyltransferase, cholesterol, total protein, albumin, globulin, and calcium. Slight urinary 
changes were not associated with remarkable clinical chemistry changes or with histopathological 
changes in the kidney. Dog studies were performed up to 39 weeks. Changes in the thymus and 
adrenal gland in dogs observed in high dose animals after 13-weeks of dosing were absent after 
39-weeks of dosing, and were considered stress related. In dogs administered 20 mg/kg/day for 
39-weeks, clinical signs (salivation, emesis, fecal changes), decreases in body weight and food 
consumption, and minimal, adaptive changes in the liver (increased weights, hypertrophy) were 
noted. After 39-weeks of dosing at 10 mg/kg/day, effects were limited to minimal hepatocellular 
hypertrophy in males, and slightly increased liver weights in females. Clinical pathology changes in 
the 4-week study included slight non-significant changes in bilirubine and ALP and approximately 
2-fold increase in ALT. In the 39-week study, slight increase in platelet count and slight decreases in 
total protein and albumin were observed and 2-fold increase in ALP; these changes were reversible 
following cessation of dosing. Slight urinary changes were not associated with remarkable clinical 
chemistry changes or with histopathological changes in the kidney.  
Cobicistat was not genotoxic in the Ames test, in a mouse lymphoma assay and in an in vivo rat 
micronucleus assay.  
In the 104-week carcinogenicity study in mice with cobicistat, no drug-related increase in tumor 
incidence was observed. In rats, increases in follicular cell adenomas and/or carcinomas in the thyroid 
gland were observed in the 104-week carcinogenicity study as well as a follicular cell carcinoma in the 
thyroid of one high dose male in the 26-week rat study. These findings are considered due to hepatic 
microsomal enzyme induction, which is considered rodent-specific and not relevant for humans.  
No adverse effects were observed in a rat fertility study with cobicistat; at the no observed effect level 
(NOEL) for reproductive parameters, the exposure was approximately 2.3-fold higher than human 
therapeutic exposures. No teratogenic effects were observed in rat and rabbit developmental toxicity 
studies. In rats, increases in post-implantation loss, skeletal variations and decreased fetal weights 
were associated with significant maternal toxicity. At the NOEL/NOAELs in the rat and rabbit studies 
exposures were approximately 1.9 and 4.7 fold higher, respectively, than human therapeutic 
exposures. In the pre/postnatal study, the maternal NOAEL for general toxicity was 30 mg/kg/day, 
and the NOAEL for reproduction in the dams and viability and growth of the offspring was 75 
mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested (exposures on lethal dose [LD] 10 were 1.3-fold human 
therapeutic exposures). In the juvenile toxicity phase of the pre/postnatal study in rats with 
cobicistat, the NOAEL for toxicity of cobicistat is 75 mg/kg/day for juvenile rats where exposures were 
2.7-fold higher (for males and females) than therapeutic adult human exposures at the therapeutic 
dose. 
Cobicistat was mildly irritating to skin and a non-severe irritant to eyes. Cobicistat showed no 
potential for sensitization in the local lymph node assay in mice. 
In a 28-day T-cell dependent antibody response study in rats, a decreased anti-KLH IgG titer was 
observed in females at ≥ 50 mg/kg/day. ). Decreased anti-KLH IgG responses in males did not reach 
statistical significance at 150 mg/kg/day. No cobicistat-related changes in the anti KLH IgM response 
in males and females were noted.

Combination darunavir and cobicistat 
No non-clinical studies were performed with the combination of darunavir and cobicistat. This was 
considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Darunavir is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.  However, the available data do not allow 
to conclude on the potential risk of cobicistat to the environment. The applicant is requested to 
provide information on the water solubility of cobicistat, determined with a GLP-compliant study 
according to OECD 105 and to provide a new bioconcentration study meeting the OECD 305 (2012) 
guideline, using test concentrations below the limit of solubility in water. A study in sediment-dwelling 
organisms according to OECD 218 is being performed and expected in Q2 2015. 
The applicant will provide  calculation on the missing DT50 values for sediment as resulted in the 
provided water sediment studies (OECD 308) or  use the recalculated values (see table below), as the 
results of the provided water sediment studies (study TMC114-NC335 and TMC114-NC319) for 
Darunavir only include DT50 values for the whole systems. No half-lives for water and sediment were 
calculated and no statistical information was provided. Therefore the quality of the stated DT50 values 
could not be verified. Recalculated DT50 values with statistical analysis (FocusDegKin v2) are as

Darunavir ethanolate exceeds the persistence trigger in the water sediment compartments indicating 
Darunavir as very persistent in the environment. 
The applicant will also discuss  the study results of the activated sludge inhibition test (OECD 209), as 
Darunavir ethanolate shows up to100 mg/l test concentrations only slightly effects to microorganism 
(max. 11.5%). At a test concentration of 1000 mg/l increased unexplained oxygen consumption was 
observed. Furthermore the laboratory prepared the test substance as stock solution (2g/l) although

the water solubility was limited (163 mg/l). Therefore a NOEC equal to the maximum water solubility 
is recommended. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Because cobicistat has no pharmacological action, pharmacodynamics interactions between darunavir 
and cobicistat are not expected.  
Darunavir did not affect hERG current and sheep Purkinje fibre action potential duration in vitro and 
did not affect ECG parameters in dogs. Systemic exposure in dogs was however not higher than 
clinical exposure and in humans. Cobicistat inhibited hERG current with IC50 values more than 15 
times clinical unbound Cmax. In vivo, cobicistat induced increases in PR but not in QT interval. 
Overall, no cardiovascular interactions are expected at clinical exposures. Also other pharmacological 
interactions between darunavir and cobicistat are not expected. 
Darunavir inhibits P-gp and cobicistat may inhibit P-gp at high concentrations in the intestinal lumen. 
Interactions of the combination of darunavir and cobicistat with substrates of P-gp are therefore 
possible. This is however also possible for the combination of darunavir and ritonavir and the 
interaction is mentioned in section 4.5 of the SmPC. Otherwise, no relevant pharmacokinetic 
interactions are expected between darunavir and cobicistat, apart from the intended interaction 
regarding CYP3A inhibition. 
The combination of darunavir and cobicistat may be expected to cause decreases in red blood cell 
parameters, since both compounds induced (limited) haematological effects. This can however be 
monitored clinically and has been included in the RMP.  
Effects on the liver induced by both compounds are mainly considered due to adaptive changes 
caused by enzyme induction. These changes can be considered not clinically relevant. Increases in 
transaminase activities and single cell necrosis as observed in the liver in the rat study treated with 
the combination darunavir + ritonavir correlated with ritonavir and not with darunavir.  No 
histopathological changes due to toxicity and no relevant transaminase activity increases were caused 
by darunavir. Cobicistat induced approximately 2-fold increases in ALT and ALP in dogs, but caused no 
histopathological changes in the liver due to toxicity. Overall, it does not seem likely that a 
significantly increased risk for liver toxicity exists for the combination of darunavir and cobicistat and 
non-clinical studies with the combination are not considered necessary. Also regarding genotoxicity, 
carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity, no studies with the combination are necessary because both 
compounds have been sufficiently characterised and there are no special causes for concern. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There are no objections against the registration of the fixed dose combination of darunavir and 
cobicistat from a non-clinical point of view.  
The applicant will submit additional study results related to the environmental risk assessment during 
2015 (timelines specified below).

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The clinical program for DRV/COBI FDC is based on the development programs of the 2 single agents 
and PK bridging of DRV co-administered with COBI to DRV co-administered with low-dose ritonavir 
(rtv). 
The PK data for DRV with the proposed DRV/COBI 800/150 mg FDC tablet were bridged with the 
existing data for DRV/rtv co-administered as single agents by conducting 2 relative oral bioavailability 
studies: 
•  Study GS-US-216-0115 compared DRV/rtv 800/100 mg co-administered as single agents 
with DRV/COBI 800/150 mg co-administered as single agents following repeated once daily 
dosing under fed conditions.  
•  Study TMC114IFD1001 compared two candidate DRV/COBI 800/150-mg FDC tablet 
formulations versus DRV/rtv 800/100 mg co-administered as single agents in healthy 
subjects following repeated once daily dosing under fed conditions. 
Absorption  
The in vitro transport characteristics of DRV and Cobi have not been investigated in the context of this 
current submission DRV and COBI as a fixed dose combination (FDC). 
Bioavailability 
Darunavir 
The absolute bioavailability of DRV was investigated in support of the marketing authorization of DRV. 
When tablet formulations of DRV (F014 [400-mg] and F015 [200-mg] used for a 600 mg dose) were 
co-administered with rtv 100 mg under fed conditions, the absolute bioavailability of DRV was 82%, 
compared with 37% when DRV was given without rtv. 
Cobicistat 
The absolute bioavailability of COBI has not been investigated. The intrinsic aqueous solubility of 
COBI free base (0.075 mg/mL, pH ~ 7) is significantly enhanced under acidic conditions at pH 2 
(70 mg/mL).

Monolayers of Caco-2 cells were used as an in-vitro model to investigate the bidirectional permeability 
and polarized transport characteristics of COBI. Similar to ritonavir (RTV), COBI was found to have 
high forward permeability through Caco-2 cells and showed no evidence for marked efflux.  
The potential for COBI to be a substrate for MDR1 or BCRP was evaluated using MDCK II cells 
expressing these transporters. COBI was reported to be a substrate for these transporters based on 
increased efflux ratios in MDR1 and BCRP over-expressing cells. Consistent with MDR1 and 
BCRP-dependent transport, the COBI efflux ratios were decreased in the presence of the MDR1 
inhibitor cyclosporin A (10 μM) and the BCRP inhibitor Ko134 (10 μM). 
The absolute bioavailability of DRV when administered as the DRV/COBI FDC has not been studied. 
Relative bioavailability studies (GS-US-216-0115, TMC114IFD1001, and TMC114IFD1003) have been 
conducted to compare the systemic exposure to DRV following the administration of various 
DRV/COBI 800/150-mg FDC tablet formulations, DRV/COBI 800/150 mg co-administered as single 
agents, and DRV/rtv 800/100 mg co-administered as single agents.

This was a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, 2-panel, 3-way crossover study to investigate the effect 
of food and different types of meals on the bioavailability of a single dose of DRV (400 mg, tablet 
formulation F014) co-administered with multiple doses of rtv 100 mg twice daily. Darunavir was taken 
immediately after 1 of 4 types of meals at breakfast, or under fasted conditions.

This was a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, 3-period, 6-way crossover study to investigate the effect 
of 2 different fed conditions (high-calorie/high-fat meal or light meal) versus fasted conditions on the 
PK of a single dose of the EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF 150/150/200/300 mg STR tablet. The COBI exposure 
parameters Cmax, AUClast, and AUC∞ were bioequivalent following a light meal compared with fasted 
conditions. For the high-calorie/high-fat meal condition, Cmax, AUC∞, and AUClast, were decreased by 
27%, 19%, and 20% relative to the light meal condition and were decreased by 24%, 17%, and 18% 
relative to the fasted condition. These lower values in COBI exposures did not result in lower EVG 
exposures. Relative to fasted conditions, EVG Cmax, AUC∞, and AUClast were increased by 22%, 34%, 
and 36%, respectively, when the STR tablet was administered following a light meal and were 
increased by 56%, 87%, and 91%, respectively, following a high-calorie/high-fat meal. Elvitegravir 
Cmax, AUC∞, and AUClast were increased by 28%, 39%, and 40%, respectively, when the STR was 
administered with a high-calorie/high-fat meal relative to a light meal. Mean FTC Cmax, AUC∞, and 
AUClast estimates and median FTC tmax estimates were similar under all treatment conditions. All 90% 
CIs were contained within the 80% to 125% bounds. Relative to fasted conditions, tenofovir AUC∞ 
and AUClast were increased by 24% and 25%, respectively, following a light meal and by 23% and 
25%, respectively, following a highcalorie/ high-fat meal. AUC estimates were bioequivalent between 
the 2 fed conditions (ie, light meal versus high-calorie/high-fat meal). Tenofovir Cmax was increased 
by 20% with a light meal relative to fasted conditions, but was similar between the 
high-calorie/high-fat meal and fasted conditions. Tenofovir Cmax was decreased by 14% with a high 
calorie/high fat meal relative to a light meal.

Distribution 
Darunavir 
The binding of DRV to human plasma proteins was assessed in studies TMC114-NC113 and 
TMC114-NC215 (see non-clinical report for further details). In study TMC114-NC113, the mean 
protein binding of DRV in human plasma was 92.3% to 96.1% across all concentrations, which 
covered the range of plasma concentrations that occur at therapeutic doses of DRV. According to the 
applicant, liquid chromatography with tandem mass-spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of buffer 
quality control samples indicated that the observed concentrations of DRV were systematically lower 
than the nominal concentrations, which was most probably caused by adsorption to the polypropylene 
containers. As this adsorption may have also occurred in the buffer compartment of the equilibrium 
dialysis system, the concentration of DRV in this matrix, and thereby the free fraction of DRV as well, 
may have been underestimated. Therefore, these protein binding data have to be interpreted with 
caution.  
In study TMC114-NC215, the binding of DRV to human plasma protein was studied by equilibrium 
dialysis of plasma samples from healthy male adults after fortification with 14C-DRV. The distribution 
of DRV in blood was also studied. The mean plasma protein binding of DRV was 95.3% at a DRV 
concentration of 500ng base-eq/mL in plasma. The percentage protein binding was independent of pH 
and apparently dependent on the plasma concentration of DRV (the concentration range of 52 to 
18,750 ng base-eq/mL [0.095 to 34.2 μM] covered the range of plasma concentrations that occur at 
therapeutic doses of DRV), including concentrations above 5,000 ng/mL. 
Darunavir was mostly bound to AAG and to a lesser extent to albumin. At a concentration of 500 ng 
base-eq/mL, the mean blood-to-plasma concentration ratio of DRV was 0.64. The fraction of DRV 
distributed to plasma water was 3.79%, the fraction distributed to plasma proteins was 77.43%, and 
the fraction distributed to blood cells was 18.79%. In general, the results on the distribution of DRV 
in blood at a concentration of 5,000 ng base-eq/mL were similar to those at the concentration of 500 
ng base-eq/mL. Therefore, measuring DRV concentrations in human plasma is relevant for clinical PK 
evaluation of DRV. 
Cobicistat  
Blood:plasma ratio 
When [14C] COBI (150 mg COBI dose) was administered on the last day of a multiple-dose period 
(150 mg once daily for 6 days) in healthy subjects in a Phase 1 open-label, mass-balance study 
(GS-US-216-0111) the blood-to-plasma ratio of total 14C-radioactivity was time-independent and ~ 
0.5, indicating that COBI is excluded from the cellular components of the blood. 
Protein binding 
Based on equilibrium dialysis studies COBI was ~97% to 98% bound to human plasma proteins 
regardless of concentration and binding was independent of concentration.

Cobicistat PK 
The mean (SD) plasma concentrations of COBI after coadministration with DRV 800 mg increased 
rapidly to a maximum at approximately 3.5 hours and then declined over 24 hours 
Elimination 
Darunavir 
In a clinical mass-balance study (TMC114-C109), the majority of 14C-DRV-related radioactivity was 
excreted in faeces (81.7% and 79.5% at 168 hours in the absence and presence of rtv, respectively); 
12.2% and 13.9% of the radioactivity was recovered in urine in the absence and presence of rtv, 
respectively, including 1.2% and 7.7% as unchanged drug. 
Darunavir was extensively metabolized in the absence of rtv (only 8% of the dose was excreted 
unchanged after 48 hours), while co-administration of rtv markedly reduced metabolism (48.8% of 
the dose excreted unchanged after 48 hours). Unchanged drug was mainly excreted in faeces, both 
with and without rtv co-administration. 
Cobicistat  
In the steady state mass balance study GS-US-216-0111 radiolabeled COBI (150 mg dose of 
[14C]COBI) was given on day 7 following administration of 150 mg daily for 6 days. All dosing was 
once daily in the fed state and was followed by sampling for 4-21 days depending on recovery of 
radiolabeled material. Data were obtained from six evaluable male subjects. 
Peak [14C] COBI plasma concentrations were observed at 4.5 h post-dose. The estimates for Cmax and 
AUC-tau were similar to values seen in other studies (e.g. GS-US-216-0120, 0115 and 0116) but the 
half-life was longer (e.g. median T1/2 was ~ 3 h in GS-US-216-0120 and 0115 and ~ 5 h in 0116). 
COBI was the predominant species in plasma in the first 24 h, representing 98.6% of the circulating 
radioactivity, and with no quantifiable metabolites. In most subjects, plasma radioactivity was not 
detectable beyond 32 h and was BLQ in all subjects by 96 h.  
Total recovery of radioactivity was 94%.  
Most (86.2%) of the dose was recovered in faeces, consistent with hepatobiliary excretion. A mean of 
62.3% of the total radioactive dose was quantified and comprised primarily the parent drug or the 
oxidative metabolites M21 (GS-9454 or E1) or M31 (GS-9612 or E3). COBI was the major species in 
the faeces (27%) followed by E3 (14%), which results from hydroxylation of isopropyl thiazole, and 
E1 (5.5%), which results from carbamate cleavage. All other metabolites detected in the faeces were 
in trace amounts, with no values exceeding 3% of the dose.  
Assessment report  
EMA/669488/2014 Corr. 1 
Page 30/100 
  
  
 
Only 8.2% of the administered dose was recovered in urine, primarily as unchanged parent drug 
(5.45%) and with low levels of metabolites M21 and M31 (each < 1%). Most of the recovered dose in 
urine (8.06%) appeared within 48h. 
COBI displayed both dose- and time-dependent changes in apparent clearance (CL/F), consistent with 
the properties of a mechanism-based inhibitor. 
A mass-balance study of the DRV/COBI FDC has not been conducted. 
Metabolism 
Darunavir  
A non-clinical study in human liver subcellular fractions and/or hepatocytes detected a relatively large 
number of metabolites for DRV (study TMC114-NC154). Major metabolic pathways identified were 
aliphatic (M21, M23), aromatic (M24, M29), alicyclic hydroxylation (M12, M27, and M28), and 
carbamate hydrolysis (M19, which was then metabolized further via various pathways to M2, M6, 
M15, M1, M11, and M3). Minor pathways included glucuronidation (M18, M20, and M17), 
N-dealkylation (M14), and N-acetylation (M30). In a nonclinical study (TMC114-NC213) using 
samples from the clinical mass-balance study TMC114-C109, in the absence of rtv, biotransformation 
of DRV occurred through aliphatic and aromatic hydroxylation, carbamate hydrolysis, and 
glucuronidation (Section 1.2.1.2.1). The predominant metabolic pathway was carbamate hydrolysis, 
accounting for 13.2% of the dose. Aliphatic hydroxylation at the isobutyl moiety towards the tertiary 
alcohol function (9.8%) and aromatic hydroxylation at the aniline moiety (4.5%) were other major 
pathways.

In the presence of rtv, the carbamate hydrolysis, isobutyl aliphatic hydroxylation, and aniline 
aromatic hydroxylation pathways were significantly inhibited, accounting for 0.67%, 2.26%, and 
1.42% of the dose, respectively. 
In vitro experiments with human liver microsomes indicate that DRV primarily undergoes oxidative 
metabolism. Darunavir is extensively metabolised by the hepatic CYP system and almost exclusively 
by CYP3A. At least 3 oxidative metabolites of DRV have been identified in humans; all showed activity 
that was at least 10 fold less than the activity of DRV against wild type HIV. 
In a clinical mass-balance study (TMC114-C109), the majority of 14C-DRV-related radioactivity was 
excreted in faeces (81.7% and 79.5% at 168 hours in the absence and presence of rtv, respectively); 
12.2% and 13.9% of the radioactivity was recovered in urine in the absence and presence of rtv, 
respectively, including 1.2% and 7.7% as unchanged drug Darunavir was extensively metabolized in 
the absence of rtv (only 8% of the dose was excreted unchanged after 48 hours), while 
co-administration of rtv markedly reduced metabolism (48.8% of the dose excreted unchanged after

48 hours). Unchanged drug was mainly excreted in faeces, both with and without rtv 
co-administration. 
Cobicistat 
In-vitro studies showed that COBI is extensively metabolised via CYP3A (major) and CYP2D6 (minor) 
mediated oxidation and does not undergo glucuronidation. There are no unique or major (>10%) 
human metabolites. Primary metabolites include isopropyl oxidation (E3=M31, GS-9612), cleavage at 
the N-methylurea (E5=M26, GS-341842), cleavage of the carbamate (E1=M21, GS-9454) and 
cleavage and deethylation of the morpholine (M39). CYP3A can catalyse all reactions, while CYP2D6 
contributes to the generation of M31. Mean plasma exposures of M31 were < 3% of COBI exposure 
(AUC) after a single 150 mg dose (GS-US-216-0111 mass-balance study; see above) or multiple 
doses (GS-US-236-0101 using the QUAD STR). 
A proposed biotransformation pathway for radiolabeled COBI is shown below. 
Figure 2. Proposed Biotransformation Pathway of COBI in Humans 
The three most abundant human metabolites of COBI are weaker inhibitors of CYP3A compared to 
COBI. Due to their low systemic concentrations they are not considered likely to contribute to CYP3A 
inhibition. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
There is no discussion by the applicant regarding the dose proportionality of DRV alone or in 
combination with Cobi. There is also no discussion of the dose proportionality of Cobi, however, 
studies GS-US-216-0101and GS-US-216-0113 are considered to be relevant to cobi.

This was a Phase 1, double-blind, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled, single- and 
multiple-dose escalation study to investigate the PK, PD, safety, and tolerability of COBI (25- and 
100-mg tablets) in 60 healthy adult subjects. Cobicistat exhibited nonlinear PK with respect to dose 
and time (Table 7). Single-dose escalation from COBI 50 mg to 100 mg and from COBI 100 mg to 200 
mg resulted in dramatic decreases in COBI apparent clearance (CL/F); the least square (LS) means 
ratio of CL/F for COBI 100 mg versus 50 mg was 23.6% and for COBI 200 mg versus 100 mg, the ratio 
was 38.4%. Similarly, the CL/F of COBI at steady state (CLss/F) following multiple-dose 
administration of COBI decreased with increasing dose; the LS means ratio of CLss/F for COBI 100 mg 
versus 50 mg was 33.5% and for COBI 200 mg versus 100 mg was 42.5%. When CL/F was compared 
following single versus multiple doses, lower values were observed following multiple doses of COBI 
at all dose levels versus single doses; the LS means ratios of single versus multiple doses were 312%, 
219%, and 199% for 50, 100, and 200 mg, respectively. 
At steady-state, systemic exposure of COBI 100 mg was 60% lower than that of rtv 100 mg.

This was a Phase 1, open-label, single- and multiple-dose, staggered dose escalation study to

Cobicistat exhibited nonlinear PK with respect to time and dose (Table 8). Single-dose escalation from 
300 to 400 mg resulted in statistically significant decreases in COBI CL/F and corresponding increases 
in AUC and Cmax without changes in t1/2, term, consistent with higher COBI bioavailability. 
Comparison of single-dose administration of 300 mg COBI with multiple dose administration of 300 
mg COBI revealed a large decrease in CL/F and increases in t1/2,term, AUC, and Cmax.

enrolled. The mean DRV exposure (Cmax and AUC24h) following multiple-dose administration of 
DRV/COBI 800/150 mg once daily co-administered as single agents was generally higher than for 
DRV following multiple-dose administration of DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily co-administered as

and AUC24h) following multiple-dose administration of DRV/COBI 800/150 mg once daily 
co-administered as single agents in study GS-US-216-0130 were generally lower than for DRV

Impaired renal function 
The DRV/COBI FDC has not been investigated in patients with renal impairment. Results from a mass 
balance study with 14C DRV/rtv showed that approximately 7.7% of the administered dose of DRV is 
excreted in the urine unchanged.  
DRV has not been studied in subjects with renal impairment, population PK analysis showed that the 
PK of DRV were not significantly affected in HIV-1 infected subjects with moderate renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance between 30 to 60 mL/min, n=20). 
GS-US-216-0124 evaluated the PK of EVG and COBI in subjects with severe renal impairment (eGFR 
< 30 mL/min) not on dialysis and matched [age ± 10 years, sex and BMI ± 15%, 18 ≤  BMI ≤  34 
kg/m2] healthy controls (eGFR ≥  90 mL/min). The actual mean eGFRCG values at baseline were 23.5 
mL/min and 97.2 mL/min, respectively. EVG 150 mg and COBI 150 mg were co-administered (using 
150 mg tablets of each) once daily in the fed state for 7 days with a 7-day follow-up.  
The LS means ratios for C24h, Cmax, and AUC24h of COBI when EVG/COBI 150/150 mg once daily was 
administered to subjects with severe renal impairment relative to matched healthy control subjects 
were 113%, 122%, and 125%, respectively (Table 11). The LS means ratios for C24h, Cmax, and AUC24h 
of EVG when EVG/COBI 150/150 mg was administered to subjects with severe renal impairment 
relative to healthy control subjects were 69%, 67%, and 76%, respectively. Notably, EVG exposure 
on Day 7 among subjects with normal renal function was substantially higher than that observed in 
previous clinical studies with EVG/COBI (GS-US- 216-0123; and GS-US-183-0133). 
For both EVG and COBI, the mean (SD) % free fraction (plasma unbound concentration) was 
determined in the subjects with severe renal impairment and the matched healthy control subjects on 
Day 7. For EVG, the mean (SD) % free fraction was 1.42 (0.17) in the renally impaired subjects and 
1.16 (0.16) in the healthy control subjects. For COBI, the mean (SD) % free fraction was 2.47 (0.62) 
in the renally impaired subjects and 2.49 (0.29) in the healthy control subjects.

Darunavir 
Study TMC114-C134 investigated the steady-state PK of DRV, administered as the 300-mg tablet 
formulation F016, together with rtv in non-HIV-1 infected subjects with mild to moderate hepatic 
impairment compared with matched healthy subjects with normal hepatic function. The study 
population included 32 subjects divided into 2 panels: 8 subjects with mild hepatic impairment and 8 
healthy matched control subjects in Panel A, and 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and 8 
healthy matched control subjects in Panel B. Panels A and B were conducted sequentially. Subjects in 
both panels received DRV/rtv at a dose of 600/100 mg twice daily for 6 days and on the morning of 
Day 7; subjects also received rtv on the evening of Day 7 and in the morning and evening of Days 8 
and 9.  
On Days 1 and 7, relative to the healthy matched control subjects, the mean exposure to DRV (Cmax, 
AUC12h, and Cmin) was lower in subjects with mild hepatic impairment and higher in subjects with 
moderate hepatic impairment. 
On Day 1, the LS mean ratios for Cmax and AUC12h of DRV were 80% and 86%, respectively, in subjects 
with mild hepatic impairment relative to healthy control subjects, and were 102% and 110%, 
respectively, in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment relative to healthy control subjects. For all 
comparisons, the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the LS means ratios were outside of the 80.00% 
to 125.00% bounds. 
On Day 7, the LS mean ratios for Cmax and AUC12h of DRV were 88% and 94%, respectively, in subjects 
with mild hepatic impairment relative to healthy control subjects, and were 122% and 120%, 
respectively, in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment relative to healthy control subjects. For all 
comparisons, the 90% CIs of the LS means ratios were outside of the 80.00% to 125.00% bounds.

Study GS-US-183-0133 investigated the steady-state PK of EVG and COBI when co-administered in 
non HIV-1 infected subjects with normal and impaired hepatic function. A total of 20 subjects (10 
healthy subjects and 10 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment) received a single 150 mg EVG 
tablet and a single 150 mg COBI tablet once daily for 10 days. Elvitegravir and COBI were 
co-administered in the morning immediately after consuming a standard meal. Each subject in the 
moderate hepatic impairment group was matched for age (±5 years), sex, and BMI (±15%) with a 
subject in the healthy control group. 
The AUC24h and Cmax of COBI were comparable in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment relative 
to healthy control subjects. The C24h of COBI was increased (LS means ratio of 208%). Elvitegravir 
exposure was modestly increased in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment relative to healthy 
control subjects. However, the observed increases were well below the protocol-defined clinically 
significant increase of 100% in EVG AUC24h or Cmax for subjects with moderate hepatic impairment 
compared to healthy matched control subjects according to the applicant, exploratory analyses 
indicated no clinically relevant correlations between the EVG or COBI exposure and 
Child-Pugh-Turcotte score or its individual laboratory components (i.e., albumin, total bilirubin, 
prothrombin time, and international normalized ratio) for subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. 
The mean (SD) % free fraction (unbound concentration) for EVG in the healthy control subjects and 
subjects with moderate hepatic impairment was 1.15 (0.14) and 1.22 (0.23) respectively, Similar 
results were observed for COBI; corresponding values were 2.71 [0.56] and 3.23 [0.63], respectively.

No drug-drug interaction studies have been performed using DRV/COBI FDC tablet formulations, or 
using DRV co-administered with COBI as separate agents. The drug-drug interaction potential of the 
FDC of DRV/COBI has been evaluated on the basis of interactions observed with each of the single 
agents, in the case of DRV, when co-administered with rtv. This was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.

Darunavir  
According to the applicant, comprehensive drug-drug interaction program has been conducted with 
DRV/rtv, including a cocktail study to assess the effects of DRV/rtv co-administered as single agents 
on the metabolism of probe substrates (TMC114-C173-CRR11). Interactions are most likely a result 
of the rtv component because of its inhibitory effects on CYP2D6, CYP3A, and certain transporters, 
and/or its induction effects on CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and UGT. 
Cobicistat 
COBI inhibits human CYP3A and so it is expected to substantially increase the systemic levels of 
co-administered drugs whose bioavailability and elimination are affected by CYP3A enzymes. CYP3A 
inducers are expected to lower COBI exposures Assessor’s comment and strong inhibitors of CYP3A 
enzymes may increase COBI exposures. Cobi does not significantly inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and 
CYP2C19 and it mildly inhibits CYP2B6 (similar to rtv). Cobi is a milder inhibitor of CYP2C8 and 
UGT1A1 activities when compared with rtv. Like rtv, COBI was found to be primarily an inhibitor of 
CYP3A and CYP2D6. 
The effects of COBI on human transporters is summarised in the Table 15. 
Table 15 
Summary of the Effect of COBI on the Activity of Human Transporters 
At human concentrations following 150 mg COBI would not be expected to inhibit the drug 
transporters MDR1, MRP1, MRP2, BCRP, OAT1 or OAT3 ([I]1/IC50 < 0.1). However, at concentrations 
achievable briefly in the intestinal lumen during absorption ([I]2 = 770 μM) COBI is expected to inhibit 
intestinal efflux transporters such as MDR1 and BCRP ([I]2/IC50 > 10). 
On this basis COBI may modestly increase exposures of substrates of P-gp. In addition, high 
concentrations of COBI in the intestinal lumen during absorption can increase systemic TFV exposure 
due to inhibition of P-gp-dependent efflux of TDF. 
COBI is expected to weakly-modestly increase exposures of substrates of MATE1 and OATP1B1/3. 
Inhibition of OCT2 and MATE1 is associated with disrupted active renal secretion of creatinine, 
resulting in a reduction in creatinine clearance in the absence of changes in true GFR. This 
phenomenon has previously been described for a variety of other agents. 
The potential for COBI to induce human drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters through the 
activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) was evaluated using 
Assessment report  
EMA/669488/2014 Corr. 1 
Page 41/100 
  
  
 
human hepatoma cell lines transfected with expression vectors for these receptors in study 
AD-216-2027. COBI showed no significant induction of AhR and mild inhibition of human PXR. 
Accordingly, induction assays using primary cultures of human hepatocytes indicated no relevant 
increases in CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 activities over a wide COBI concentration range (1 to 30 μM). Mild 
activity was observed for CYP3A at higher concentrations (27% of positive control at 10 μM). At 
plasma concentrations found in humans, COBI would be expected to have no effect on the expression 
of secondary targets of PXR such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, UGT1A1, and P-gp, and would have very little 
effect on the expression of CYP3A4 mRNA. Any effect on CYP3A enzyme activity would be masked by 
mechanism-based inhibition. 
In vivo 
According to the applicant, a comprehensive drug-drug interaction program with DRV/rtv was 
conducted, including a cocktail study to assess the effects of DRV/rtv on the metabolism of probe 
substrates. It is considered by the applicant that interactions are most likely a result of the rtv 
component because of its inhibitory effects on CYP2D6, CYP3A and certain transporters, and/or its 
induction effects on CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT). The 
applicant did a summary of the interactions and recommendations to use DRV/rtv in combination with 
various drugs in DRV SmPC based on previous studies conducted with darunavir/ritonavir. 
The applicant considers that COBI like rtv, is an inhibitor of CYP3A and is also an inhibitor of CYP2D6, 
albeit to a lesser extent than rtv. Therefore, most data generated with DRV/rtv relating to these 
enzymes can be extrapolated to DRV/COBI. For drugs that are (pure) CYP2D6 or CYP3A substrates, 
the interaction between DRV/COBI and DRV/rtv is expected to be similar in magnitude.  
According to the applicant, potential differences between DRV/rtv and DRV/COBI with regard to 
drug-drug interactions could arise from interaction with transporters including P-glycoprotein (P-gp; 
rtv appears to inhibit P-gp to a greater extent than COBI in vitro), as well as drug metabolizing 
enzymes such as CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, and 2C19 (rtv induces CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, and 2C19, 
whereas COBI may have little to no effect on these enzymes) and UGT1A1 (rtv induces UGT1A1 
whereas COBI is not an inducer of UGT1A1). As COBI has less overall effects on drug metabolizing 
enzymes and transporters compared to rtv, different drug-drug interactions could be expected with 
DRV/COBI. Drugs primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and/or UGT1A1 that are 
coadministered with DRV/rtv may eventually increase in exposure when treatment is switched to 
DRV/COBI. The applicant considers that caution is needed during the first 2 weeks after switch from 
rtv to COBI, particularly if doses of any concomitantly administered medicinal products have been 
titrated or adjusted during use of rtv as a PK enhancer. 
The applicant considers that Darunavir/COBI should not be used in combination with another ARV that 
requires PK enhancement (eg, EVG and other HIV PIs), since dosing recommendations for such 
combination have not been established. Darunavir/COBI should not be used concurrently with 
medicinal products containing rtv or regimens containing rtv or COBI.  This is endorsed by CHMP. 
A number of studies were conducted with DRV/rtv and other drugs.

Investigated the effect of omeprazole and ranitidine on the PK of DRV at steady-state, coadministered 
with rtv. The PK of DRV was unaffected by coadministration of ranitidine or omeprazole. The LS mean 
ratios for Cmax and AUC12h of DRV when DRV/rtv was coadministered with ranitidine relative to 
administration of DRV/rtv alone were 96% and 95%, respectively. 
TMC114-C150 
Investigated the effect of steady-state concentrations of DRV, coadministered with rtv, on the PK of a 
single dose of digoxin. The LS mean ratios for Cmax and AUC24h of digoxin when digoxin was 
coadministered with DRV/rtv relative to administration of digoxin alone were 129% and 135%, 
respectively. The 90% CIs of the LS means ratios were large because of the substantial intersubject 
variability (ISV).

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The darunavir/cobicistat (DRV/COBI) fixed dose combination (FDC) tablet is a combination of 2 single 
agents, DRV and COBI.  Darunavir is an approved human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) 
protease inhibitor (PI). Cobicistat has recently been registered to be co-administered as a 
pharmacokinetic enhancer of DRV and atazanavir (ATV). Comprehensive drug development programs 
have been conducted for the individual compounds DRV (in combination with low-dose ritonavir [rtv] 
as pharmacokinetic enhancer) and COBI. 
Darunavir 
Darunavir is an inhibitor of the dimerisation and of the catalytic activity of the HIV-1 protease (PR) 
(dissociation constant [Kd] of 4.5 x 10-12M). It selectively inhibits the cleavage of HIV encoded 
Gag-Pol polyproteins in virus infected cells, thereby preventing the formation of mature infectious 
virus particles.  
Cobicistat  
Cobicistat, a structural analogue of RTV and it is a potent mechanism-based inhibitor of human 
hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A activity.  Cobicistat is devoid of anti-HIV and exhibited 
no antiviral activity against 17 HIV-1 and 2 HIV-2 primary isolates.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
Darunavir exhibits activity against laboratory strains and clinical isolates of HIV-1 and laboratory 
strains of HIV-2 in acutely infected T-cell lines, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 
and human monocytes/macrophages (M/Ms) with median 50% effective concentration (EC50) values 
ranging from 1.2 to 8.5 nM (0.7 to 5.0 ng/mL). The DRV EC50 values observed in primary cells were 
comparable to these observed in cell lines.

In Vitro Antiviral Activity of DRV in T-cell lines

and M/Ms) 
In Vitro Antiviral Activity of DRV in HIV-1 Infected Primary Cells (PBMCs 
Darunavir demonstrates antiviral activity in vitro against a broad panel of HIV-1 group M (A, B, C, D, 
E, F, G) and group O primary isolates with EC50 values ranging from <0.1 to 4.3 nM. These EC50 values 
are well below the 50% cellular toxicity concentration range of 87 μM to >100 μM. In addition, DRV is 
not an inhibitor of human cellular PRs. 
Table 19 
In Vitro Antiviral Activity of DRV Against Primary Isolates in Human PBMCs 
Darunavir is able to bind tightly to HIV-1 protease to form a highly stable complex with both WT and 
mutant proteases. Crystal structures suggested that darunavir might maintain activity against 
mutant proteases because of: 
-   formation of several hydrogen bonds, mostly with main chain atoms of the HIV-1 protease;  
-   close fit within the substrate consensus volume; 
-   flexibility that appeared to compensate for any potential reduction in interaction resulting from  
mutations in the HIV-1 PR. 
The antiviral activity of DRV was determined on a screening panel of 20 PI resistant recombinant 
viruses. Eighteen of the 20 (90.0%) viruses were susceptible to DRV showing no significant increases 
in EC50 value compared with HIV-1/IIIB (EC50 <10nM, FC<4). 
The antiviral activity of DRV was determined against 3,309 recombinant HIV-1 isolates with a 
decreased susceptibility (FC>4) to at least 1 of the following PIs: APV, ATV, IDV, LPV, NFV, RTV, SQV, 
or TPV. Darunavir EC50 values were ≤ 10 nM for 78% of the isolates, while an EC50 >100 nM was 
observed for only 3% of the isolates. Eighty percent of the isolates exhibited a DRV FC<4 and 10% a 
DRV FC>10. Genotypic data were available for 1,113 of the PI resistant viruses. Subgroups of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/669488/2014 Corr. 1 
Page 53/100 
  
  
 
 
 
viruses with up to 3 primary PI mutations and/or up to 8 PI resistance-associated mutations had a 
median fold change ≤ 4 for DRV. 
The antiviral activity of DRV has been determined against 14 HIV-1 PI-resistant primary isolates in 
PBMCs. Only 14% (2 of 14) of the isolates had a FC>4 for DRV compared with 57% (8 of 14) for SQV 
and 65% (9 of 14) for APV, 93% (13 of 14) for NFV, 100% (14 of 14) for RTV, and 100% (7 of 7) for 
LPV. 
The combination of DRV with HIV-1 inhibitors was studied in an anti-HIV-1/IIIB MT4 cell-based assay. 
A combination index was calculated using the isobologram model for combinations. DRV did not show 
antagonism when studied in combination with the PIs APV, ATV, IDV, LPV, NFV, RTV, SQV, or TPV, 
NRTIs abacavir (ABC), didanosine (ddI), FTC, lamivudine (3TC), stavudine, TFV, zalcitabine, or 
zidovudine (AZT), the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) delavirdine, efavirenz 
(EFV), etravirine, nevirapine (NVP), or rilpivirine1 and the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide (T-20). The data 
indicate additivity with all NRTIs and NNRTIs. A modest synergistic effect with APV, NFV and RTV was 
observed whereas additive effect was described for the combination with ATV, IDV, LPV SQV, and TPV 
and with T-20. 
Cobicistat  
Inhibition of HIV-1 Proteases 
COBI (GS-9350) and RTV were evaluated in an in vitro enzymatic assay for their inhibitory effect on 
HIV-1 PR enzymatic activity. COBI did not have any effect on the HIV-1 PR enzymatic activity at 
concentrations up to 30 µM. In comparison, the IC50 for RTV was 0.6 nM when tested in parallel under 
the same assay conditions. These enzyme inhibition data indicate that COBI is not an inhibitor of the 
HIV-1 PR. 
Inhibition of the Activity of Human Proteases 
The potential inhibitory activity of COBI was evaluated against cathepsin. Unlike RTV, COBI did not 
exhibit any activity towards this enzyme. 
In Vitro Antiviral Activity 
There was no inhibition (100% activity remaining) of HIV replication in the presence of 30 μM COBI 
relative to the untreated control. The EC50 values of COBI in the presence of 40% human serum were 
>90 μM. None of the tested metabolites of COBI, M21, M26, and M31, were found to have HIV-1 
antiviral activity, up to a concentration of 30 µM. 
The antiviral activity of COBI was tested in PBMCs against a panel of 17 HIV-1 and 2 HIV-2 primary 
isolates. Different groups of HIV-1 (M, N, and O), as well as the most prevalent group M subtypes (A, 
B, C, D, E, F, and G), were represented among the tested isolates. There was no inhibition of HIV-1 
replication in the presence of COBI. Ritonavir was used as a control and exhibited the expected level 
of antiviral activity across all tested isolates. Two HIV-2 isolates were also evaluated; no selective 
antiviral activity of COBI was observed against the tested isolates. 
In Vitro Cytotoxicity 
COBI was less cytotoxic (CC50 = 89 μM) than RTV (CC50 = 38 μM) in MT-2 cells and showed a level of 
cytotoxicity similar to RTV in HepG2 cells (CC50 of 44 μM and 64 μM, respectively).

Darunavir/Cobicistat Fixed Dose Combination 
No in vitro virology studies have been performed with the DRV/COBI FDC. The resistance profile of 
DRV/COBI FDC is driven by DRV. Due to its lack of antiviral activity, COBI does not select any HIV 
resistance mutations. 
Secondary pharmacology 
TMC114-C153 
This was a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin), 4-way 
crossover study to assess the cardiac safety of DRV (400-mg tablet formulation F001), together with 
rtv, in 40 healthy adults, with particular attention to the QT/QTcF interval duration and the influence 
of DRV/rtv on other electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, such as QRS and PR intervals. Each subject 
received treatment in 4 sessions: DRV/rtv 1600/100 mg once daily for 7 days (Treatment A), DRV/rtv 
800/100 mg twice daily for 7 days (Treatment B), moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily for 7 days 
(Treatment C), and placebo once daily for 7 days (Treatment D). 
Eleven 12-lead time-matched triplicate ECGs on Day -1 (pre-treatment baseline), Day 1 (first dose), 
and Day 7 (last dose at steady-state) at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 hours after the morning 
dose of each treatment period plus 1 additional 12-lead triplicate ECG after 24 hours on Day 2 and 
Day 8 were recorded. Subsequent sessions were separated by a washout period of 7 days. All 
treatments were administered under fed conditions and pharmacokinetic data were obtained on days 
1 and 7. 
The Fridericia correction (QTcF) was used as the primary correction method for statistical evaluation 
of the QT interval. However, Bazett’s correction (QTcB) and Sagie’s (Framingham) correction (QTcS) 
were also employed 
The primary statistical comparison was the maximum mean change vs placebo for the 1600/100 mg 
q.d. group using the Fridericia correction. 
QTc data 
Time-matched differences in QTcF were increased for DAR/RTV vs placebo at most time points.  
On Day 1, the largest time-matched mean changes in QTcF vs placebo were observed at 3 h after 
1600/100 mg and at 2 h after 800/100 mg with values of 3.0 ms and 2.9 ms, respectively. 
On Day 7, the largest values time-matched mean changes in QTcF vs placebo were observed at 4 h 
post-dose in both DAR/RTV groups with values of 6.1 ms and 5.0 ms, respectively. 
The upper two-sided 90% CIs on the time-matched mean changes vs placebo did not exceed 10 ms 
on either Day 1 or Day 7. 
After moxifloxacin on Day 1 post-dose differences in QTcF vs placebo were 4.5 to 10 ms and Day 7 
values were 5.5 to 14.1 ms. The time-matched difference vs pre-dose was 5.2 ms at 2 h 
post-moxifloxacin but –4.7 ms for placebo, giving a maximal difference of 9.9 ms.  
At 4 h post-moxifloxacin on Day 7 the time-matched difference was 8.4 ms compared to –5.3 ms for 
placebo, giving a maximal difference of 13.7 ms.  
The upper two-sided 90% CI on the mean difference in QTcF vs placebo were 12.19 ms and 16.82 ms 
on Days 1 and 7, respectively.  
It was concluded that moxifloxacin was an appropriate positive control according to E14 ICH.

With 14 females (2 discontinued) and 26 males (2 discontinued) the small sample size in females gave 
less accurate estimates for the mean time-matched change vs pre-dose and wider CIs. On Day 7 at 3 
and 4 h post-placebo the mean decrease in QTcF was more extreme in females than in males so the 
difference for DAR/RTV vs placebo was larger in females. However, there was little or no increase in 
QTcF vs pre-dose at around Cmax on Day 7 for females given 1600 mg darunavir.   
Data derived from application of QTcB, QTcS, individually linear (QTcIL), individually non-linear 
(QTcINL), trial specific linear (QTcL) and trial specific non-linear correction (QTcNL) have been 
summarised. 
For 1600/100 mg q.d. the upper two-sided 90% CIs for the greatest observed changes vs placebo 
control remained below 10 ms for all QT corrections and for QT uncorrected on Day 1.  
On Day 7 the upper 90% CI for QTcL, QTcS and uncorrected QT slightly exceeded 10 ms at 10.0, 10.4 
and 10.9 ms, respectively, while that for QTcB was 12.9 ms at 4 hours after dosing. The upper bounds 
resulting from the linear model were < 10 ms except for QTcB at 11.8 ms at 4 hours after dosing. 
For 800/100 mg b.i.d. only the two-sided 90% CI upper bound of QTcB and uncorrected QT on Day 7 
exceeded 10 ms (12.7 ms at 2 h and 14.8 ms at 10 h after dosing, respectively). The upper bound of 
the two-sided 90% CI resulting from the linear mixed model was > 10 ms for uncorrected QT (10.2 ms 
at 10 h) but < 10 ms for QTcB (9.3 ms). 
For moxifloxacin, two-sided 90% CIs’ upper bounds of the maximum mean QT changes exceeded 10 
ms at all time points (from 10.4 to 14.9 ms on Day 1 and 14.7 to 22.0 ms on Day 7). This was 
confirmed by the estimates resulting from the linear mixed model, for which upper bounds were 
above 10 ms for all QT corrections and uncorrected QT. 
There were no QT values that exceeded 500 ms and no increases in QT larger than 60 ms.  
Treatment-emergent increases of 30-60 ms (using QTcF) occurred in three (8%) subjects during 
moxifloxacin treatment but one with 800/100 mg b.i.d. and in none during other treatments.  
Treatment-emergent prolonged QTc (i.e. to 450 ms/470 ms by gender) was seen for all corrections in 
one subject during moxifloxacin treatment and in two subjects based on QTcB data during 800/100 
mg b.i.d.  
Day 7 data showed a trend for greater maximum change in QTcF with higher darunavir and 
moxifloxacin plasma concentrations. Using a linear mixed model the observed and predicted time 
matched changes QTcF vs concentration gave a non-significant interaction between gender and 
concentration with a p-value of 0.064. The estimated slope of QTcF vs plasma darunavir was 
0.000659 (90% CI 0.000184 to 0.001135) but the applicant pointed out that the relationship was 
shallow since for every 1000 ng/mL increase in darunavir concentration the predicted shift in QTcF is 
only 0.66 ms. At the mean maximum darunavir concentration observed (6599 ng/mL) the mean 
increase in QTcF was 2.2 ms (90% CI –2.0 to 6.3 ms). 
PR interval data 
Maximum increases in PR on Day 1 were similar between treatment groups but on Day 7 the DAR/RTV 
groups showed a higher maximum increase (12.2 and 14.7 ms) compared to placebo (8.9 ms). The 
overall mean change was higher in the DAR/RTV groups (3.3 and 5.7 ms) compared to placebo (0.3 
ms). Similar conclusions can be drawn from the mean time-matched differences in PR versus Day –1. 
The maximum time-matched change in PR interval vs placebo was found at 1 h post-dose on Day 7 of 
800/100 mg b.i.d., when PR had increased by 6.3 ms. However, the Day 7 maximum change vs 
placebo in the 1600/100 mg q.d. group was observed before dosing (4.9 ms). In contrast, the largest 
mean changes vs placebo on Day 1 in the two DAR/RTV groups were 2.6 and 2.3 ms.

This was a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin), 
partially-blinded, 4-way crossover study to assess the cardiac safety of COBI (100- and 150-mg 
tablets) in 48 healthy adults. Subjects were randomized to 1 of 2 Williams squares, and then to 1 of 
4 possible treatment sequences within each Williams square (6 subjects per treatment sequence). 
Treatments were separated by a 6-day washout period. Subjects received a single dose of the 
following treatments on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 as follows: 
Treatment A: COBI 250 mg (1 COBI 150-mg active tablet, 1 COBI 100-mg active tablet, and 1 placebo 
150-mg tablet). 
Treatment B: COBI 400 mg (2 COBI 150-mg active tablets, 1 COBI 100-mg active tablet). 
Treatment C: Placebo control (2 placebo 150-mg tablets, 1 placebo 100-mg tablet). 
Treatment D: Moxifloxacin 400 mg (1 moxifloxacin 400-mg tablet). 
All treatments were administered under fed conditions within 5 minutes after a meal. Cobicistat 
exhibited nonlinear PK, with an approximately 2.1-fold increase in AUC∞ and a 1.8-fold increase in 
Cmax following administration of COBI 400 mg relative to COBI 250 mg. Exposure to COBI (AUC and 
Cmax) following administration of COBI 250 mg and 400 mg was higher than the steady-state 
exposure following administration of COBI 150 mg when administered once daily as a 
pharmacoenhancer (AUC24h approximately 11,000 ng.h/mL; Cmax approximately 1,500 ng/mL). 
Table 20 
mg COBI (Study GS-US-216-0107) 
PK Parameters of COBI Following Single-Dose Administration of 250 or 400 
Evaluation of the baseline-adjusted mean differences between COBI 250 and 400 mg and placebo and 
their associated 2-sided 90% CIs demonstrated a lack of prolongation effect on the QTcF interval 
following COBI administration; the upper bounds of the 2-sided 90% CIs were < 10 ms at all 
time-points after dosing. The upper bounds of the 2-sided 90% CIs were also <10 ms for the COBI 
250-mg and 400-mg doses at all timepoints for QT interval corrected for heart rate using 
population-specific correction factor and QT interval corrected for heart rate using subject-specific 
correction factor. 
An upper bound of the 2-sided 90% CI for QT interval corrected for heart rate using the Bazett 
formula was >10 ms (10.1 ms) at a single time-point (12 hours) with the COBI 400 mg dose. No 
subject had an absolute QTc interval >480 ms at any post-dose assessment, or change from pre-dose 
baseline QTc >60 ms using any of the correction factors following any of the treatments. The lower 
bound of the 2-sided 90% CI for the mean difference between the positive control and placebo was >5 
ms at more than 1 time-point after dosing, thereby establishing assay sensitivity. 
According to the applicant, in the ART-naïve group of study GS-US-216-0130, in which subjects were 
treated with DRV/COBI 800/150 mg once daily co-administered as single agents in combination with 
2 NRTIs, there was no apparent relationship between the decrease in log10 plasma viral load from 
baseline at Week 24 and DRV exposure. Virologic success (plasma viral load of <50 HIV-1 RNA 
copies/mL) was comparable across the first to third DRV exposure quartiles (93.8% to 97.2% for 
AUC24h and 93.7% to 97.3% for C0h) and was modestly lower in the fourth (i.e., highest) DRV 
Assessment report  
EMA/669488/2014 Corr. 1 
Page 57/100 
  
  
 
exposure quartile (86.2% for AUC24h and 86.4% for C0h). Apparently, a similar result was observed in 
study TMC114-C211, in which ART-naïve HIV-1 infected subjects were treated with DRV/rtv 800/100 
mg once daily co-administered as single agents in combination with a fixed background regimen of 
TDF and FTC. There was no apparent relationship between the PK of DRV and the decrease in log10 
viral load from baseline at Week 48 or virologic response, defined as a plasma viral load of <50 or 
<400 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL. A GAM analysis, exploring the relationship between DRV C0h and virologic 
response in study TMC114-C211, showed no indication that lower values within the observed DRV C0h 
range lead to lower estimated virologic response. The mean predicted virologic response was 92.8% 
in the total population.  
In study GS-US-216-0130, a GAM analysis was used to generate predictions of a smoothed spline for 
virologic response (defined as a plasma load of <50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL) at Week 24 by DRV AUC24h 
or C0h in ART-naïve subjects. Inverse relationships were observed among ART-naïve subjects for both 
DRV AUC24h and C0h. This inverse relationship disappeared at week 48 as virologic response was 
comparable across all the different quartiles of exposure with no significant effect of exposure on 
response. This inverse relationship has previously been noted and is not considered to be clinically 
relevant.  
Inverse exposure-response relationships for virologic success have been observed previously in 
ART-experienced subjects treated with DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily co-administered as single 
agents. In study TMC114-C229, the decrease in log10 viral load from baseline at Week 48 tended to 
be smaller in subjects with higher AUC24h values, while no relevant relationship between AUC24h and 
the decrease in log10 viral load was observed in the DRV/rtv 600/100 twice daily group. A similar trend 
was seen for virologic success, defined as a plasma viral load of <50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL, at Week 
48. 
A GAM analysis exploring the relationship between DRV C0h and virologic response in study 
TMC114-C229 showed an inverse relationship between DRV C0h and virologic response in the 
ART-experienced HIV-1 infected population of study TMC114-C229; virologic response was somewhat 
lower in the highest 2 deciles of the observed DRV C0h range, suggesting a counterintuitive. However, 
in the first 8 deciles (DRV C0h values up to 2,961ng/mL), there was no clear relationship between DRV 
C0h and virologic response at the observed rate, and variability was higher in the last 2 deciles. 
Because DRV Ctau was notably lower when co-administered with COBI relative to rtv in the Phase 1 
studies (ie, GS-US-0216-0115 and TMC114IFD1001), the impact of a potential reduction of DRV C0h 
was further explored using the GAM. The same model used to predict virologic response was used to 
simulate a similar population with a 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and50% reduction in DRV C0h. Based on 
this analysis, a reduction in DRV C0h of up to 50% did not negatively impact the mean predicted 
response. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In order to characterise the pharmacokinetics of this fixed dose combination (FDC), the applicant 
relies on studies conducted with the single agents, studies conducted with Darunavir (DRV) and 
ritonavir (rtv), a bioequivalence study of the FDC and single dose DRV with COBI and a bioequivalence 
study of DRV co-administered with COBI and DRV with rtv.  
This approach is considered acceptable in principle as the pharmacokinetic of the single agents have 
previously been characterised.  
DRV co-administered with COBI was demonstrated to be bioequivalent to DRV co-administered with 
rtv in study GS-US-216-0115, the 90% confidence interval for AUCtau and Cmax  lie within 
80-125%however the Ctau for DRV when co-administered with cobi was lower than DRV 
Assessment report  
EMA/669488/2014 Corr. 1 
Page 58/100 
  
  
o-administered with rtv the reason for this is not absolutely clear but not considered to be an issue 
(this was discussed during the assessment of cobicistat and will not be pursued any further).  
Study TMC114IFD1001 also demonstrated bioequivalence of two FDC formulations of DRV + Cobi and 
DRV + rtv.  
Additionally, study TMC114IFD1003 demonstrated bioequivalence of a FDC formulation with 2X 
400mg DRV and 150 mg COBI administered as single agents.  
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of DRV alone, DRV+rtv and COBI as have previously been 
well-characterised and there are no particular issues to highlight.  
No drug-drug interaction studies have been performed using DRV/Cobi FDC tablet formulations or 
DRV co-administered with Cobi as separate agents and the applicant bases the drug interaction 
potential on the interactions observed with each single agent and DRV when co-administered with rtv. 
This is considered to be acceptable as the differences between Cobi and rtv appear to have been taken 
into account. 
Darunavir is an inhibitor of the dimerisation and of the catalytic activity of the HIV-1 protease (PR) 
and it selectively inhibits the cleavage of HIV encoded Gag-Pol polyproteins in virus infected cells, 
thereby preventing the formation of mature infectious virus particles. While Cobicistat a structural 
analogue of RTV and a potent mechanism-based inhibitor of human hepatic microsomal cytochrome 
P450 (CYP) 3A activity). Cobicistat is devoid of anti-HIV activity and exhibits no antiviral activity 
against 17 HIV-1 and 2 HIV-2 primary isolates.  
The results of study TMC114-C153 suggest that darunavir causes small increases in QTc and PR 
intervals when compared to placebo which are probably not clinically relevant. For COBI the results of 
study GS-US-216-0107 demonstrated modest increases in PR interval at around 3.5 h post-dose 
which are probably not clinically important or relevant changes. 
One topic that merits attention is the further reduction of DRV exposure in case of co-medication with 
inductive effect on CYP3A4, such as efavirenz. Co-administration is not recommended because of 
both reduced DRV and COBI exposures. When switching from an EFC containing regimen to 
DRV/COBI the inductive effect of efavirenz could affect exposure to DRV/COBI. Two categories of 
patients who will switch from efavirenz to DRV/cobi based regimens must be considered: 1) patients 
intolerant to efavirenz but with virologic suppression, and 2) patients failing on efavirenz without 
virologic suppression. For the first category the concentration of DRV is far above the EC50 regardless 
of waning induction by EFV. In combination with the effect of the backbone ARVs DRV concentration 
will be sufficient to maintain virologic suppression.  
The second patient category has been studied in the ODIN study with convincing results if no 
DRV-associated mutations are present and viral load < 100,000 copies/ml. Although efficacy data was 
not provided separately from this particular subgroup of virologic failures on EFV, the efficacy in the 
once daily DRV arm in the ODIN study is comforting. The mean DRV C0h in HIV-infected subjects in 
study GS-US-216-0130 was >37-fold above the protein binding corrected EC50 for wild-type virus (55 
ng/mL). It is anticipated that the DRV exposure will be lowered by no more than 15-30%. Therefore, 
the DRV concentration above the EC50 is probably sufficient in patients with treatment failure on EFV, 
with the known caveats (specific DRV mutations and viral load restriction) that are now pronounced in 
the SmPC for this patient category.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Due to pharmaco-enhancement of liver enzymes by COBI the exposure of DRV is similar to that when 
RTV is used as pharmaco-enhancer of DRV. From the PK studies is was demonstrated that DRV Ctau  
was ~30% lower.  
Assessment report  
EMA/669488/2014 Corr. 1 
Page 59/100 
  
  
The Applicant demonstrated during the application of COBI as a separate medicinal product that 
decreases of Ctau were not associated with virologic outcome, neither in the registration studies – 
when RTV was used - nor in the currently submitted study GS-US-216-0130 with COBI. This is 
considered acceptable.  
Although EFV-containing regimens through induction of CYP3A4 could reduce DRV exposure levels, 
this is unlikely to be problematic in case of switch from EFV-containing regimens to DRV/COBI in the 
first weeks after switch. Although the DRV exposure could be reduced, the DRV concentration above 
the EC50 is likely to be sufficient in patients with treatment failure on EFV, with the known caveats 
(specific DRV mutations and viral load restriction) that are now pronounced in the SmPC for this 
patient category. 
Efficacy is not affected by differences in DRV exposure, and also safety is not. There was no evidence 
that COBI exposures were higher and there is no evidence of an association between COBI plasma 
concentrations and the presence of rash, drug hypersensitivity or discontinuation due to an adverse 
event (AE).  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical program for DRV/COBI FDC is primarily based on the comprehensive development 
programs of the 2 individual compounds and on the pharmacokinetic bridging clinical program. As the 
DRV/COBI FDC 800/150 mg is indicated as a ‘substitution indication’ of an already approved regimen, 
no comparative efficacy study was conducted. The efficacy data provided in support of DRV/COBI FDC 
in adult subjects consists of the following: 
(1)   A Phase 1 study TMC114IFD1001, investigating the relative oral bioavailability of 2 FDC 
formulations (G003 and G004) of DRV/COBI 800/150 mg once daily and that of DRV/rtv 800/100 
mg once daily co-administered as single agents under fed conditions. 
(2)   A Phase 1 study TMC114IFD1003, assessing the bioequivalence of DRV when co-administered 
with COBI either as the FDC (formulation G006) or the single agents under fed and fasted 
conditions. 
(3)   An on-going Phase 3b, open-label, single-arm study GS-US-216-0130 assessing safety (primary 
objective), efficacy and pharmacokinetic parameters (secondary objectives) in HIV-1 infected 
adult subjects treated with DRV/COBI 800/150 mg once daily co-administered as single agents 
for at least 48 weeks. 
(4)   A brief summary of the virologic response and immunologic benefit of DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once 
daily as established in the historical studies TMC114-C211 (also referred to as ARTEMIS) in 
antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve HIV-1 infected adult subjects, and TMC114-C229 (also 
referred to as ODIN) in ART-experienced HIV-1 infected adult subjects with no DRV RAMs are 
also provided in support of DRV/COBI FDC.  
Cobistat  
The proof-of-concept study (GS-US-216-0115) and the pharmacokinetic bridging studies 
TMC114-IFD1001 and TMC114IFD1003 provide evidence of the primary pharmacodynamics 
properties of COBI as a pharmacokinetic enhancer of DRV.

2.5.1.  Main study 
GS-US-216-0130 
A Phase 3b open-label, single-arm, multicenter study in HIV-1 infected, ART-naïve adult 
subjects or ART-experienced adult subjects with no DRV RAMs. 
Methods 
Study Participants 
A total of 314 subjects were enrolled, and 313 subjects received at least 1 dose of study medication 
DRV/COBI 800/150 mg once daily co-administered as single agents. Of these 313 subjects, 295 
(94.2%) were ART-naïve and 18 (5.8%) were ART-experienced. Subjects were considered 
treatment-naïve if they had never received treatment with an approved or investigational ARV drug. 
Subjects were considered treatment-experienced if they had been on a stable ARV regimen for at 
least 12 weeks prior to screening. After 48 weeks of treatment, subjects were given the option to 
participate in an open-label rollover extension of the study to receive COBI, DRV, and 
investigator-selected NRTIs, and attend study visits every 12 weeks until COBI becomes 
commercially available, or until Gilead elects to terminate development of COBI. Subjects who 
completed the Week-48 visit and did not wish to participate in the rollover part of the study were 
required to complete a follow-up visit 30 days after the Week-48 visit. 
Eligibility criteria  
Subjects enrolled in this study were HIV-1 infected subjects, ≥  18 years of age, who were either 
treatment-naive (no ARV drugs for any length of time) or treatment-experienced (stable ARV 
treatment for at least 12 weeks prior to screening) and met the following criteria: 
Plasma HIV-1 RNA levels ≥  1000 copies/mL at screening 
Screening genotype report shows full sensitivity to two nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors (NRTIs) and none of the following DRV-associated resistance mutations (RAMs): V11I, 
V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54M, I54L, T74P, L76V, I84V or L89V. 
Treatments 
DRV/COBI 800/150 mg once daily co-administered as single agents plus 2 fully active 
investigator-selected NRTIs selected after resistance testing at screening. In subjects with the 
M184V/I reverse transcriptase mutation present at screening, FTC or lamivudine (3TC) could be 
included as a third (not-fully active) NRTI for the purpose of maintaining the M184V mutation. 
Objectives 
Primary objective 
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of DRV/COBI 800/150 mg plus 2 NRTIs in the studied 
population through 24 weeks of treatment. 
Secondary objectives  
•  To assess the safety and tolerability of the regimen through 48 weeks of treatment, 
•  To assess the efficacy of the regimen as determined by a virologic response of HIV-1 RNA <50  
            copies/mL at Weeks 24 and 48 of treatment 
•  To assess the change from baseline in CD4+ cell count at Weeks 24 and 48.

Conduct of the study 
A total of 35 protocol deviations occurred in 31 subjects during the study. Of the 31 subjects, 2 had 2 
deviations and 1 had 3 deviations. The majority of deviations (15 of 35) were for incorrect 
dispensing/dosing of study drugs. Deviations were proportionally distributed among study centres. A 
total of 15 subjects were incorrectly dispensed/dosed study drugs, 14 were in the treatment-naive 
cohort and 13 achieved virologic success according the FDA Snapshot algorithm. A total of 9 subjects 
had procedural protocol deviations. The majority of these subjects had retesting of required 
laboratory tests out of window. Subjects were retested as soon as possible and were not discontinued 
from the study. 
A total of 8 subjects violated at least 1 eligibility criterion. All of these violations were identified after 
treatment had commenced. One subject was asked to come in for an ESDD visit and a 30-day 
follow-up visit due to an exclusionary eGFR. All other subjects were not discontinued from the study. 
Baseline data 
The majority of subjects in the treatment-naive cohort were male (266 of 295 subjects,90.2%). The 
mean age was 36 years (range, 18 to 72 years), most were white (176 of 295 subjects, 59.7%) or 
black (101 of 295 subjects, 34.2%), and non-Hispanic/Latino (231 of 295 subjects, 78.3%). The 
mean value for BMI at baseline was 26.2 kg/m2. In the treatment-experienced cohort, 13 of 18 
subjects (72.2%) were male. The mean age was 45 years (range, 22 to 69 years), most were white 
(11 of 18 subjects, 61.1%) or black (7 of 18 subjects, 38.9%), and non-Hispanic/Latino (14 of 18 
subjects, 77.8%). The mean value for BMI at baseline was 25.6 kg/m2. 
Baseline disease characteristics  
For subjects in the treatment naive cohort, the mean (SD) baseline HIV-1 RNA value was 4.8 (0.76) 
log10 copies/mL, CD4 cell count was 378.2 (199.94) cells/μL, and CD4% was 22.6% (9.99%). The 
most common HIV risk factor category was homosexual sex (238 of 295 subjects, 80.7%). The 
majority of subjects had asymptomatic HIV-1 infection (241 of 295 subjects, 81.7%), 26 of 295 
subjects (8.8%) had symptomatic HIV-1 infection, and 28 of 295 subjects (9.5%) were diagnosed 
with AIDS. A small percentage of subjects were HBsAg positive (1.7%, 5 of 295 subjects) or HCV 
seropositive (2.4%, 7 of 295 subjects). The mean (SD) baseline eGFRCG (calculated using observed

mL/min/1.73m2, and the mean (SD) baseline cysGFR was 97.6 (21.87) mL/min/1.73m2. 
For subjects in the treatment-experienced cohort, the mean (SD) baseline HIV-1 RNA value was 4.8 
(1.04) log10 copies/mL, CD4 cell count was 197.8 (214.30) cells/μL, and CD4% was 11.9% 
(10.25%). At the time of initial ARV treatment, the CD4 cell count was 229.6 (225.89) and the HIV-1 
RNA value was 5.1 (0.87) log10 copies/mL. The mean (SD) number of years since HIV diagnosis in the 
treatment-experienced cohort was 10.8 (7.13). The most common HIV risk factor category was 
homosexual sex (9 of 18 subjects, 50.0%). 
The majority of subjects had asymptomatic HIV-1 infection (10 of 18 subjects, 55.6%), 
Two of 18 subjects (11.1%) had symptomatic HIV-1 infection, and 6 of 18 subjects (33.3%) were 
diagnosed with AIDS. No subjects were HBsAg positive and 1 subject was HCV seropositive (5.6%). 
The mean (SD) baseline eGFRCG (calculated using observed body weight) was 103.6 (37.77) mL/min, 
the mean (SD) baseline eGFRMDRD was 92.5 (19.09) mL/min/1.73m2, and the mean (SD) baseline 
cysGFR was 81.5 (25.80) mL/min/1.73m2.

Outcomes and estimation 
Proportion of Subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 24 and 48; Snapshot 
Analysis 
Virologic success at Week 24 was achieved by 83.7% (247 of 295 subjects) of subjects in the 
treatment naive cohort. Virologic success at Week 48 was achieved by 82.7% (244 of 295 subjects). 
The percentage of subjects with virologic failure at Week 24 was 9.8% (29 of 295 subjects) and the 
percentage of subjects with no virologic data in the Week 24 window was 6.4% (19 of 295 subjects).  
For the treatment-naïve subjects, of the 29 subjects who were virologic failure at Week 24, 9 gained 
response by Week 48. As 17 subjects of the 19 subjects with no virologic data at Week 24 
discontinued the study before Week 24, the outcome of these subjects remained unchanged by Week 
48.  
The number of subjects in the treatment-experienced cohort was small (n = 18). In this cohort, 
virologic success was achieved by 61.1% (11 of 18 subjects) at Week 24 and by 50.0% (9 out of 18 
subjects) at Week 48. The percentage of subjects with virologic failure at Week 24 was 38.9% (7 of 
18 subjects) and no subjects had no virologic data in the Week 24 window. Of the 5 subjects with 
virologic failure at Week 24 due to HIV-1 RNA ≥  50 copies/mL, 1 was lost to follow up, 3 did not have 
additional HIV-1 RNA levels after Week 24 at the data cut-off date for this CSR, and 1 subject had < 
50 copies/mL at Week 36. 
For the treatment-experienced subjects, of the 7 virologic failures at Week 24, 1 subject became a 
responder at Week 48.

Proportion of Subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 24 and Week 48 by 
baseline viral load (≤ 100,000 copies/mL vs. >100,000 copies/mL); Snapshot Analysis 
In the treatment-naive cohort, the percentage of subjects who achieved virologic success at Week 24 
was higher in subjects who had a baseline viral load of ≤  100,000 copies/mL (87.9% [152 of 295 
subjects]) compared with those who had a baseline viral load of > 100,000 copies/mL (77.9% [95 of 
122]).   
In the Week-48 analysis, there was a 2.7% difference in the response rates between subjects with a 
baseline viral load ≤ 100,000 copies/mL (83.8%) versus subjects with a baseline viral load >100,000 
copies/mL (81.1%).

Load Category (Snapshot Analysis; Full Analysis Set) 
GS-US-216-0130: Treatment Outcomes at Week 24 and 48 by Baseline Viral 
The Applicant highlighted that in study TMC114-C211 (ARTEMIS study), discussed under supportive 
studies, the difference in response between patients with a baseline viral load ≤ 100,000 copies/mL 
versus subjects with a baseline viral load >100,000 copies/mL too decreased with time, although at 
Week 48 study baseline viral load remained  predictive of response: 85.8% (194/226) in the patients 
with < 100,000 copies/ml and 79.5% (93/117) in patients with > 100,000 copies/ml at baseline. 
These results indicate that patients with higher viral loads at start therapy possibly respond slower.

These are not consistent with each other. The response in the Treatment Naïve arm as seen in table 
27 seems to mimic the snapshot analysis presented in table 24, and is unlikely the TLOVR analysis. It 
is unclear whether the Week-48 TLOVR analysis presented with de response to the D120 LoQ can be 
relied on. The Applicant was asked to check the TLOVR analyses submitted with the Week-48 efficacy 
analyses in their response and either confirm that they are correct, and if so then explain the 
discrepancy with the Week-24 TLOVR analyses submitted with the initial application, or if not then to 
submit the correct analyses. The difference in virologic response (time to loss of virologic response 
[TLOVR]) at the Week-24 time point in the Week-24 analysis (240 subjects, 76.7%) and the Week-24 
time point in the Week-48 analysis (256 subjects, 81.8%) was due to 16 subjects who had achieved 
human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) ribonucleic acid (RNA) <50 copies/mL at the Week-24 
visit but for whom response was not yet confirmed (ie, HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL at 2 consecutive 
visits) at time of the Week-24 analysis. After receipt of the confirmation sample, these 16 subjects 
were accordingly classified as Week 24 responders / no responders in the Week-48 analysis.  
A total of 78.6% of subjects (232 of 295 subjects) in the treatment-naive cohort achieved and 
maintained confirmed HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL through Week 24 and were considered responders. 
The percentage of subjects classified as non-responders (those with virologic failure) was 10.2% (30 
of 295 subjects). Reasons for virologic failure included viral rebound (0.7% [2 of 295 subjects]) and 
never suppressed through Week 24 (9.5% [28 of 295 subjects]). A total of 5.1% (15 of 295 subjects)

and 6.1% (18 of 295 subjects) of subjects were defined as non-responders due to study drug 
discontinuation due to AE and other reasons, respectively.  
In the treatment naive-cohort, the percentage of responders at Week 24 was higher in subjects who 
had a baseline viral load of ≤  100,000 copies/mL (83.8% [145 of 295 subjects]) compared with those 
who had a baseline viral load of > 100,000 copies/mL (71.3% [87 of 122]). The difference in virologic 
success between subgroups was primarily attributable to the higher number of subjects who were 
never suppressed through Week 24 in the > 100,000 copies/mL versus the ≤  100,000 copies/mL 
category (18.9% [23 of 122 subjects] and 2.9% [5 of 173 subjects], respectively). The difference was 
offset by the higher number of subjects who discontinued study drug due to an AE in the ≤  100,000 
copies/mL category versus the > 100,000 copies/mL category (6.9% [12 of 173] and 1.6% [2 of 
122], respectively). 
In the treatment-experienced cohort, 44.4% of subjects (8 of 18 subjects) achieved and maintained 
confirmed HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL through Week 24 and were considered responders. The 
percentage of subjects classified as non-responders was 38.9% (7 of 18 subjects). The only reason 
for virologic failure was no viral suppression through Week 24. A total of 16.7% (3 of 18 subjects) of 
subjects were considered non-responders as a result of drug discontinuation due to other reasons.

subjects) using LOCF analysis, and 61.1% (11 of 18 subjects) using the M = F method. Consistent 
with the treatment-naive cohort, no plateau in response was achieved by Week 24. The percentage of 
subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 24 and a baseline viral load of ≤  100,000 copies/mL 
was 62.5% [5 of 8 subjects] using the M = E method, 62.5% [5 of 8 subjects] using LOCF analysis, 
and 55.6% [5 of 9 subjects] using the M = F method. The percentage of subjects with HIV-1 RNA <

subjects] using the M = E method, 66.7% [6 of 9 subjects] using LOCF analysis, and 66.7% [6 of 9] 
using the M = F method. 
Change from Baseline in Plasma HIV-1 RNA 
For subjects in the treatment-naive cohort, the mean (SD) baseline HIV-1 RNA level was 4.75 (0.759) 
log10 copies/mL. HIV-1 RNA levels decreased following initiation of study drugs with the greatest 
mean decrease occurring within the first 2 weeks of treatment. At Week 24, the mean (SD) decrease 
from baseline in HIV-1 RNA was −3.00 (0.788) log10 copies/mL. At week 48, the mean (SD) decrease 
was -3.01 (0.817). When stratified by baseline viral load, the mean (SD) decrease from baseline in 
HIV-1 RNA was −3.65 (0.614) and -3.68 (0.646) in subjects with a baseline viral load of > 100,000 
copies/mL and −2.54 (0.532) and -2.53 (0.549) in subjects with a baseline viral load of ≤  100,000 
copies/mL at Week 24 and Week 48 respectively.  
In the treatment-experienced cohort, the mean (SD) baseline HIV-1 RNA level was 4.83 (1.044) 
log10 copies/mL. HIV-1 RNA levels followed similar trends to that observed for subjects in the 
treatment-naive cohort. At Week 24, the mean (SD) decrease from baseline in HIV-1 RNA was −2.56 
(1.459) log10 copies/mL. At Week 48 it was -2.39 (1.786). When stratified by baseline viral load, the 
mean (SD) decrease from baseline in HIV-1 RNA was −3.72 (0.523) and -3.70 (0.342) in subjects 
with a baseline viral load of > 100,000 copies/mL and −1.40 (1.108)  and -0.89 (1.544) in subjects 
with a baseline viral load of ≤  100,000 copies/mL at Week 24 and Week 48 respectively. 
Change from Baseline in CD4 Cell Count 
For subjects in the treatment-naive cohort, mean (SD) baseline CD4 cell count was 378 (199.9) 
cells/μL. CD4 cell counts increased following initiation of study drugs and continued to increase with 
increased duration of exposure to study drugs. At Week 24, the mean (SD) increase from baseline in 
CD4 cell count, based on observed data, was 145 (131.6) cells/μL. At Week 48 this was 194 (152.1) 
cells/µl.  When stratified by baseline viral load, the baseline CD4 cell count was 431 (192.6) cells/µL 
in subjects with a baseline HIV-1 RNA of ≤  100,000 copies/mL and 304 (186.7) cells/μL in subjects 
with a baseline HIV-1 RNA of > 100,000 copies/mL. At Week 24, the change in CD4 cell count was 165 
(141.8) cells/μL in subjects with a baseline viral load of > 100,000 copies/mL and 130 (122.2) cells/μL 
in subjects with a baseline viral load of ≤  100,000 copies/mL. 
In the treatment-experienced cohort the mean (SD) baseline CD4 cell count was 198 (214.3) cells/μL. 
Similar trends in the change in CD4 cell count to those observed for the treatment-naive cohort were 
observed. At Week 24 and Week 48 the mean (SD) increase from baseline in CD4 cell count, based on 
observed data, was 99 (161.9) cells/μL and 121 (157.0) cells/µl respectively. When calculated using 
the LOCF method, it was 88 (155.4) cells/μL and 102 (149.3) cells/µl respectively. 
Change from Baseline in CD4 Percentage 
CD4% increased following initiation of study drugs and continued to increase with increased duration 
of exposure to study drugs. At Week 24 and Week 48, the mean (SD) increase from baseline in CD4%

was 7.2% (4.52%) and 9.0% (5.00%) respectively. The trends observed for CD4% when stratified by 
baseline viral load where similar to those observed for CD4 cell count.  
In the treatment-experienced cohort, the mean (SD) baseline CD4% was 11.9% (10.25%) CD4% 
increased following initiation of study drugs and at Week 24 and Week 48 the mean (SD) increase 
from baseline in CD4% was 4.1% (3.31%) and 4.2% (3.88%) respectively. The trends observed for 
CD4% when stratified by baseline viral load where similar to those observed for CD4 cell count. 
Resistance analysis 
Of the 313 subjects who received at least 1 dose of the study medication DRV/COBI 800/150 mg once 
daily, 10 met the criteria for postbaseline resistance analysis:  
-  5 treatment-naïve subjects (1 confirmed suboptimal virologic response, 2 virologic rebounds, 
and 2 discontinuations with HIV-1 RNA ≥ 400 copies/mL at last visit). 
-  5 treatment-experienced subjects (1 confirmed suboptimal virologic response, 2 virologic 
rebounds, and 2 discontinuations with HIV-1 RNA ≥ 400 copies/mL at last visit).  
One ART-experienced subject who started with 5 CD4 cells and high viral load (6.6 million copies/ml) 
had poor adherence and developed a DRV RAM at position I84 as a mixture withwild type [WT] 
(I84I/V). Another subject had RT mutations that were not affecting his background ARVs.  
Among the remaining 8 subjects, 3 subjects had no change in PR and RT, and the 5 other subjects 
only had singly occurring mutations at sites not associated with ARV resistance and were not 
associated with phenotypic fold changes to any ARV. None developed any other primary or secondary 
PI RAMs and also no phenotypic resistance to DRV or other PIs was observed.

Summary of Efficacy for trial GS-US-216-0130 
Title: A Phase 3b, open-label, single arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cobicistat-boosted 
darunavir plus two fully active nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in HIV-1 infected, 
antiretroviral treatment-naïve and -experienced adults with no darunavir resistance associated 
mutations. 
Study identifier 
Design 
GS-US-216-0130 
The ongoing study is an open-label, single arm, multicenter, study that 
evaluates the safety and efficacy of a regimen of darunavir (DRV) + cobicistat 
(COBI) plus 2 fully active nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in 
HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral (ARV) treatment-naïve and 
treatment-experienced adult subjects with no DRV resistance associated 
mutations (RAMs). 
The study consists of an eligibility screening (within 35 days before 
baseline/Day 1 visit), a 48-week open-label treatment period, and a follow-up 
visit 30 days after last drug intake. After 48 weeks of treatment, subjects will 
be given the option to participate in an open-label rollover study to receive 
DRV, COBI, and investigator-selected NRTIs, and attend study visits every 12 
weeks until COBI becomes commercially available (or until Gilead Sciences, Inc 
[GSI] elects to terminate its development). Subjects who complete treatment 
through the Week-48 visit and decide not to participate in the rollover study will 
be required to complete the 30-day follow-up visit.

DRV/COBI 800/150 mg once daily 
coadministered as single agents plus 2 fully 
active investigator-selected NRTIs selected 
after resistance testing at screening, for 48 
weeks. 
The primary safety endpoint was any 
treatment-emergent grade 3 or grade 4 
adverse events (AEs) that occurred through 
Week 24. The secondary safety endpoints 
included any treatment-emergent AEs through 
the data cu-offt date for the Week-24 analysis, 
including any that led to discontinuation of 
either DRV or COBI. Additional safety 
assessments included the monitoring of all 
AEs, clinical laboratory measures, 12-lead 
electrocardiograms (ECGs), and physical 
examinations. 
The efficacy endpoints included the proportion 
of subjects who achieved HIV-1 RNA <50 
copies/mL at Week 24 as defined by the FDA 
Snapshot algorithm, the time to confirmed 
achievement and maintenance of (2 
consecutive) HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL 
through Week 24 (time to loss of virologic 
response [TLOVR]), the proportion of subjects 
with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL at Week 24 
using missing = failure (M=F), missing = 
excluded (M=E), and last observation carried 
forward (LOCF) methods, and the change in 
CD4+ cell count using M=E and LOCF methods 
at Week 24. Similar analyses were done at 
Week 48. 
Assessment of the development of genotypic 
and phenotypic resistance in subjects who 
experienced virologic failure was also 
performed. 
PK parameters were determined for DRV, 
COBI, emtricitabine (FTC), and tenofovir (TFV) 
based on intensive sampling between Weeks 2 
and 8 in a subset of subjects (n=60) at 
selected sites (PK substudy) and a single PK 
blood sample at all visits through Week 48 was 
planned for all subjects. The population PK of 
DRV and the relationship between the DRV PK 
and pharmacodynamics (PD) were explored.

Resistance development to DRV or other PIs, and to the background NRTIs was 
rare in this study. Of the 313 treated subjects, 10 met the criteria for 
postbaseline resistance analysis (5 treatment-naïve and 5 
treatment-experienced). No genotypic and phenotypic resistance development 
was seen in the ART-naïve subjects. One treatment-experienced subject with 
poor pill bottle returns indicative of poor adherence had developed a DRV RAM 
at position I84 as a mixture with wild-type (I84I/V) through 24 weeks. No 
phenotypic resistance to DRV or other PIs was observed. No subjects 
developed any other primary or secondary PI RAMs. No subjects developed an 
NRTI RAM (or phenotypic resistance) to their concomitant NRTI regimen.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The applicant has performed a comparison and analyses of results across studies given that the 
efficacy and resistance profiles of DRV have been established in the DRV/rtv development program, 
and the Phase 1 studies GS-US-216-0115 and TMC114IFD1001 demonstrated comparable 
pharmacokinetics of DRV/rtv and DRV/COBI with the proviso that these comparisons should be 
interpreted with caution because of the inherent inherent limitations associated with the use of 
historical data as control and the small sample size of the treatment-experienced subgroup further 
limits the interpretation of this historical comparison in this subgroup. 
The Week-24 results of the 295 treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults in the GS-US-216-0130 study 
were compared with the Week-24 results of the treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults treated with 
DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily of the Phase 3b study TMC114-C211. The Week-24 results of the 18 
treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected adults with no DRV RAMs in the GS-US-216-0130 study were 
compared with the Week-24 results of the DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily treatment group of the 
Phase 3b study TMC114-C229, which included adult treatment-experienced subjects with no DRV 
RAMs at baseline. 
The treatment-naïve subject populations of TMC114-C211 and GS-US-216-0130 are similar with 
respect to demographic data and baseline disease and resistance characteristics. The 
treatment-experienced subjects of study GS-US-216-0130 are somewhat older (median age was 48 
years, while it was 40 years in TMC114-C229), and the median number of years (range) since HIV 
diagnosis was 8.5 years (range 2 to 24 years) in the GS-US-216-0130 study, while it was 1.1 years 
(range 0 to 22 years) in study TMC114-C229. The treatment-experienced subjects in study 
GS-US-216-0130 also have a slightly higher baseline viral load (mean log10 viral load was 4.8 
copies/mL) than those in study TMC114-C229 (mean log10 viral load 4.2 copies/mL), and a lower 
CD4+ cell count (mean cell count 198x106 cells/L) than those in study TMC114-C229 (mean cell 
count 250x106 cells/L). The percentage of subjects with HIV-1 RNA ≥ 100,000 copies/mL was 50.0% 
in study GS-US-216-0130, and 13.3% in study TMC114-C229. 
In treatment-naïve subjects, the efficacy of treatment with DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily in study 
TMC114-C211 is similar to that seen with DRV/COBI 800/150 mg once daily coadministered as single 
agents in study GS-US-216-0130. The percentage of subjects reaching virologic response at Week 24 
(snapshot analysis) was 81.6% in the historical study TMC114-C211, and 83.7% in the 
treatment-naïve subgroup of study GS-US-216-0130. The change from baseline in log10 viral load at 
Week 24 was -3.11 copies/mL with DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily and -3.00 copies/mL with 
DRV/COBI 800/150 mg once daily. The change from baseline in CD4+ cell count at Week 24 was 
+142x106 cells/L and +145x106 cells/L with DRV/rtv and DRV/COBI, respectively. 
In treatment-experienced subjects (n=18), the percentage of subjects reaching virologic response at 
Week 24 was 70.1% in the historical study TMC114-C229, and 61.1% in the treatment-experienced

subgroup of study GS-US-216-0130. The decrease in log10 viral load at Week 24 was -2.09 copies/mL 
with DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily, and -2.56 copies/mL with DRV/COBI 800/150 mg once daily. 
The change from baseline in CD4+ cell count was +83x106 cells/L and +99x106 cells/L with DRV/rtv 
and DRV/COBI, respectively. 
Resistance development to DRV or other PIs, and to the background NRTIs was rare in the Week-24 
analysis of study GS US-216-0130. These low levels of resistance development were comparable to 
those observed in the DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily arm of TMC114-C211 and TMC114-C229, 
confirming the clinical resistance profile of DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily in ART-naïve subjects and 
ART-experienced subjects with no DRV RAMs and the high genetic barrier of DRV whether boosted 
with COBI or rtv. 
Supportive studies 
Study TMC114-C211 
A randomized, controlled open-label trial to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 
TMC114/ritonavir compared with lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with a fixed background once 
daily regimen of FTC (200 mg) and TDF (300 mg) in treatment naive adult patients with HIV 1 RNA ≥  
5000 copies/mL. 
The primary objective of this Week-48 analysis was to demonstrate non-inferiority in virologic 
response (time to loss of virologic response [TLOVR]), defined as a confirmed plasma viral load of < 
50 copies/mL, with DRV/rtv (800 mg/100 mg q.d.) versus LPV/rtv (800 mg/200 mg total daily dose) 
at 48 weeks, when administered in combination with a fixed background regimen, consisting of 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC) in a treatment-naïve, HIV-1 infected 
population with a predefined delta of non-inferiority of 12%. Secondary objectives were to evaluate 
other virologic parameters and immunologic parameters, to compare the quality of life, to assess 
pharmacokinetics, resistance characteristics, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships, and 
to evaluate safety and tolerability over time. Analyses were also performed at Week 96 (when all 
subjects had reached 96 weeks or discontinued earlier) and at Week 192, in support of the long-term 
use of DRV/rtv versus LPV/rtv in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected subjects. 
The efficacy results of this trial demonstrated non-inferiority in virologic response defined as a 
confirmed plasma viral load of < 50 copies/mL at Week 48 (primary efficacy parameter) with DRV/rtv 
800/100 mg q.d. when compared to a daily dose of LPV/rtv 800/200 mg (both in combination with a 
fixed background regimen of TDF/FTC). The results for the primary efficacy parameter were 
supported by those for the secondary virologic parameters. These results were confirmed in the 
Week-96 analysis, and sustained up to 192 weeks of treatment of study TMC114-C211. Virologic 
response at Week 192 was achieved in 68.8% of subjects in the DRV/rtv group and 57.2% in the 
LPV/rtv group (ITT, TLOVR).

Efficacy Summary – TMC114-C211 Week-48 and Week-96 Analyses 
The percentage of virologic failures, (rebounders and subjects who were never suppressed using the 
TLOVR [non-VF censored algorithm] defined as loss of or never achieving a plasma viral load < 50 
copies/mL, respectively), was lower in the DRV/rtv group than in the LPV/rtv group. Of the 343 
DRV/rtv subjects, 34 (9.9%) experienced virologic failure versus 49 of 346 (14.2%) LPV/rtv subjects. 
In the DRV/rtv group, 8 (2.3%) subjects were rebounders and 26 (7.6%) subjects were never 
suppressed. In the LPV/rtv group, 10 (2.9%) subjects were rebounders and 39 (11.3%) subjects 
were never suppressed. Development of resistance was assessed in the virologic failures for which 
matching baseline/endpoint genotypic profiles were available, 10 and 18 subjects in the DRV/rtv and 
LPV/rtv group, respectively. In the virologic failures of the DRV/rtv group, there were no emerging 
PI-RAMs identified. In one subject of the LPV/rtv group, 2 PI RAMs emerged by endpoint. In 1 subject 
of the DRV/rtv group and 2 subjects of the LPV/rtv group, 1 developing NRTI RAM was identified at 
endpoint, which was associated with a decreased susceptibility to FTC included in the background 
regimen. 
Study TMC114-C229 
A Phase 3, randomized, open-label, 48-week study comparing DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily versus 
DRV/rtv 600/100 mg twice daily in ART-experienced HIV-1 infected subjects with screening genotype 
resistance testing showing no DRV RAMs and with a viral load >1,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL and a 
CD4+ cell count >50x106 cells/L at screening. Both arms used an OBR of at least 2 NRTIs. 
At baseline, the mean duration of HIV-1 infection was 8.5 years; the mean log viral load was 4.16 
log10 copies/mL; 86.7% of the subjects had a viral load <100,000 copies/mL. The median CD4+ cell 
count was 228x106 cells/L; 57.5% of subjects had a baseline CD4+ cell count ≥ 200x106/L and 
16.7% had a baseline CD4+ <100x106 cells/L. 
At Week 48, virologic response, defined as the percentage of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 
copies/mL, with DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily was demonstrated to be noninferior (at the 
predefined 12% non-inferiority margin) compared to DRV/rtv 600/100 mg twice daily for the ITT and 
OP populations of treatment-experienced subjects carrying 0 DRV RAMs.

Table 32 
Efficacy Summary – TMC114-C229 Week-48 Analysis 
The virologic failure rate (HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL TLOVR non-VF-censored) was similar in the 
DRV/rtv once daily group (65/294, 22.1%) and DRV/rtv twice daily group (54/296, 18.2%). 
Development of resistance was infrequent among virologic failures in both treatment groups. Of all 
virologic failures with matching baseline/endpoint genotypes, only 1 subject (DRV/rtv once daily) 
developed primary (major) PI mutations, including DRV RAMs, and lost susceptibility to DRV. The 
proportion of virologic failure subjects who retained susceptibility to all currently available PIs was 
96.6% for the DRV/rtv once daily group and 100% for the DRV/rtv twice daily group. In the DRV/rtv 
once daily group, 7/59 (11.9%) virologic failures, with available phenotypes at baseline and endpoint, 
lost susceptibility to an NRTI in the background regimen, compared to 4/41 (9.8%) in the DRV/rtv 
twice daily group. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The clinical program for DRV/COBI FDC is primarily based on a pharmacokinetic bridging clinical 
program and the comprehensive development programs of the 2 individual compounds (Darunavir 
and Cobicistat). The efficacy data provided therefore consists only of bioavailability studies 
investigating the relative oral bioavailability of 2 FDC formulations of DRV/COBI 800/150 mg once 
daily and that of DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily co-administered as single agents used used in 
combination and assessing the bioequivalence of DRV when co-administered with COBI either as the 
FDC (formulation G006) or the single agents under fed and fasted conditions and an on-going Phase 
3b, open-label, single-arm study GS-US-216-0130 assessing safety (primary objective), efficacy and 
pharmacokinetic parameters (secondary objectives) in HIV-1 infected adult subjects treated with 
DRV/COBI 800/150 mg once daily co-administered as single agents for at least 48 weeks. 
Additionally, data from the historical studies TMC114-C211 (also referred to as ARTEMIS) in 
antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve HIV-1 infected adult subjects, and TMC114-C229 (also referred to 
as ODIN) in ART-experienced HIV-1 infected adult subjects with no DRV RAMs using DRV/rtv are 
provided in support.

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
An open label phase 3b, open-label, single-arm study GS-US-216-0130 is provided to support the 
proposed indication and is considered acceptable on this occasion as data from two historic studies 
TMC114-C211 (ARTEMIS) and TMC114-C229 are also provided in support. The primary objective of 
the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of DRV/cobi in combination with 2NRTIs through 
24 weeks of treatment and secondarily to assess the efficacy of the regimen in terms of virologic 
response (plasma viral load <50 copies/mL) at 24 and 48 weeks using a snap-shot analysis. 
In the open-label study GS-US-216-0130, a disparity in the reasons for discontinuing is noted, the 
Applicant was asked to clarify. The slight discrepancy was clarified by the applicant. Of the 295 
subjects included in the treatment-naive cohort study GS-US-216-0130, 254 subjects in the FAS 
(86.1%) were still on study drugs whilst 261 subjects (88.5%) completed the study up to week 48; 
thus 41 subjects prematurely discontinued the study drug whilst 34 subjects prematurely 
discontinued the study.  
There are no major concerns regarding the methodology of this study. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Three hundred and fourteen (314) subjects were enrolled into the study: 296 treatment-naive 
subjects and 18 treatment-experienced subjects out of whom 313 subjects received at least one dose 
of both study medications. Majority of these subjects were ART-naïve (94.3%) while 5.7% were 
ART-experienced.  
In the treatment naïve group the mean baseline log10 HIV-1 RNA value was 4.8 copies/ml and the 
mean baseline CD4+ cell count was 378 x 106 cells/L. 
For the treatment experienced group, the mean baseline log10 HIV-1 RNA value was 4.8 copies/ml 
and the mean baseline CD4+ cell count was 198 x 106 cells/L. About 2/3rd of this group had CD4+ cell 
count less than 200 x 106 cells/L.  
The results of this open-label study showed that virologic response at 24 weeks was achieved by 83% 
of the treatment naïve subjects and in treatment-experienced cohort (which had very small numbers) 
virologic response was achieved by 61.1% (11 of 18 subjects). At 48 weeks virologic response was 
achieved by 82.7% of the treatment naïve subjects and 50.0% in the treatment-experienced cohort. 
Of the 29 subjects treatment-naïve subjects who were virologic failure at Week 24, 9 gained response 
by Week 48. As 17 subjects of the 19 subjects with no virologic data at Week 24 discontinued the 
study before Week 24, the outcome of these subjects remained unchanged by Week 48.  For the 
treatment-experienced subjects, of the 7 virologic failures at Week 24, 1 subject became a responder 
at Week 48. 
In the TLOVR analysis (a viral load <50 copies at 2 consecutive visits required), a total of 78.6% of 
subjects (232 of 295 subjects) in the treatment-naive cohort achieved and maintained confirmed 
HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL through Week 24 and were considered responders. In the 
treatment-experienced cohort, 44.4% of subjects (8 of 18 subjects) achieved and maintained 
confirmed HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL through Week 24 and were considered responders. The Week 
24 TLOVR analyses provided with the response to the D120 LoQ were inconsistent with the analyses 
provided with the initial submission. The difference in virologic response (time to loss of virologic 
response [TLOVR]) at the Week-24 time point in the Week-24 analysis (240 subjects, 76.7%) and the 
Week-24 time point in the Week-48 analysis (256 subjects, 81.8%) was due to 16 subjects who had 
achieved human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) ribonucleic acid (RNA) <50 copies/mL at the 
Week-24 visit but for whom response was not yet confirmed (ie, HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL at 2 
consecutive visits) at time of the Week-24 analysis. After receipt of the confirmation sample, these 16 
subjects were accordingly classified as Week 24 responders / no responders in the Week-48 analysis.

Additionally, these results were compared with DRV/rtv data from studies TMC114-C211 (ART- naïve 
subjects) and TMC114-C229 (ART-experienced subjects). Overall, there was a suggestion that the 
response to DRV/cobi can be considered comparable to DRV/rtv. It should however be noted that such 
cross-study comparisons should always be viewed with extreme caution.  
In the treatment-naive cohort, the percentage of subjects who achieved virologic success at Week 24 
was higher in subjects who had a baseline viral load of ≤  100,000 copies/mL (87.9% [152 of 295 
subjects]) compared with those who had a baseline viral load of > 100,000 copies/mL (77.9% [95 of 
122]), mainly due to delayed suppression, because in 6 from 17 virologic failures had HIV-RNA levels 
at week 36 of <50 copies/ml at the data cut-off analysis date. In the Week-48 analysis, there was a 
2.7% difference in the response rates between subjects with a baseline viral load ≤ 100,000 
copies/mL (83.8%) versus subjects with a baseline viral load >100,000 copies/mL (81.1%). These 
results indicate that patients with higher viral loads at start therapy possibly respond slower. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Taking into consideration the results of the PK studies TMC114IFD1001 and Study GS-US-216-0115 
which show bioequivalence of DRV/cobi compared to DRV/rtv, it is possible to conclude that the 
results of this single arm study of DRV/cobi+2 fully active NRTIs are demonstrative of efficacy.   
Efficacy data for DRV/COBI 800/150 mg qd can be extrapolated to patients failing on other regimens 
with the same limitations as DRV/RTV 800/100 mg qd. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety profile of the DRV/COBI FDC is based on the data from the Phase 3b study 
GS-US-216-0130 in HIV-1 infected subjects, Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects (TMC114IFD1001 
and TMC114IFD1003) and on the safety profiles of the individual agents, DRV (in combination with 
rtv) and COBI.

Adverse events 
The most frequently reported AEs by preferred term were headache (72.2%), fatigue (61.1%), 
diarrhoea (30.6%), nausea (27.8%), skin irritation (27.8%), and pruritus (25.0%). No clinically 
relevant differences between treatments in incidence of AEs were observed. Most AEs were grade 1 or 
grade 2 in severity. No grade 4 AEs were reported. Grade 3 AEs were only reported for 3 subjects 
(8.3%): fatigue (DRV/rtv) and maculo-papular rash (DRV/COBI FDC tablets G003 and G004). 
Adverse events considered at least possibly related to study medication were reported for 66.7% of 
subjects. Adverse events considered very likely related to the study medication were reported for 4 
subjects (11.1%); 2 subjects during DRV/rtv (1 rash, and 1 rash and pruritus), 1 subject during 
DRV/COBI G003 (maculo-papular rash), and 1 subject during DRV/COBI G004 (maculo-papular 
rash). Five subjects (13.9%) discontinued treatment prematurely due to an AE, all grade 2 or 3 in 
severity and all considered related to the study medication; 2 subjects during DRV/rtv treatment 
(both rash), 2 subjects during intake of DRV/COBI FDC G003 (rash and maculo-papular rash), and 1 
subject during intake of DRV/COBI FDC G004 (maculo-papular rash). 
After single dose administration of DRV/COBI either as FDC or as single agents, (study 
TMC114IFD1003), the most frequently reported AEs by preferred term (in at least 5% of subjects) 
were headache (40 subjects, 30.1%), muscle spasms (12 subjects, 9.0%), and diarrhea (11 subjects, 
8.3%). No clinically relevant differences between treatments in incidence of AEs were observed. Most 
AEs were grade 1 or grade 2 in severity. No grade 3 or 4 AEs were reported. In this study, 20.3% of 
subjects had AEs that were considered at least possibly related to DRV, 19.5% of subjects had AEs 
that were considered at least possibly related to COBI. The most frequent AEs considered as at least 
possibly related to DRV and COBI were headache (8.3%), diarrhea (7.5%), nausea (3.8%). One 
subject (0.8%) experienced rash during this study. The rashes occurred both under DRV/COBI single 
agent treatment (grade 1) and DRV/COBI FDC treatment (grade 2) and were assessed as at least 
possibly related at the 2 occasions. No subject permanently stopped or temporarily interrupted the 
study medication due to an AE. 
Of the 313 subjects who received at least 1 dose of both study medications DRV and COBI in study 
GS-US-216-0130, 295 were treatment-naïve and 18 were treatment-experienced. In the Week-24 
analysis, 5.8% of subjects experienced at least 1 grade 3 (5.1%) or grade 4 (0.6%) AE (primary 
endpoint). All grade 3 or 4 AEs were reported in 1 subject (0.3%), except for hypersensitivity (3 
subjects, 1.0%) and maculo-papular rash (2 subjects, 0.6%). Five subjects (1.6%) experienced at 
least 1 grade 3 AE that was considered study drug-related by the investigator: neuropathy peripheral 
and immune reconstitution syndrome (both reported in the same subject), hypersensitivity, allergic 
dermatitis, maculo-papular rash, and vesicular rash (reported in 1 subject each). There were 2 grade 
4 AEs in 1 subject each, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and hypersensitivity, neither were 
assessed as drug-related.

Overall, 87.9% of subjects experienced at least 1 AE of any severity. By preferred term, the most 
frequently occurring AEs (in >5% of all subjects) were diarrhea (24.9%), nausea (21.4%), upper 
respiratory tract infection (9.9%), headache (9.3%), rash (preferred term, 8.6%), vomiting (8.3%), 
fatigue (6.4%), flatulence (6.1%), nasopharyngitis (5.8%) and sinusitis (5.4%). These reported AEs 
were consistent with those expected in the subject population and the known safety profiles of the 
study medications.

least grade 2 ADRs) was similar between the GS-US-216-0130 and TMC114-C211 studies (48.9% and 
49.0%, respectively).

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no deaths in the Week-24 analysis of this study. Fifteen subjects (4.8%) experienced at 
least 1 SAE. All SAEs were reported in 1 subject except for pyrexia (n=2). Three SAEs were considered 
related to DRV/COBI, each occurring in 1 subject: immune reconstitution syndrome (grade 3), rash 
(preferred term, grade 1, led to treatment discontinuation), and maculo-papular rash (grade 3, led to 
treatment discontinuation). 
Laboratory findings 
There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline through Week 24 in mean values for the 
hematology parameters or clinical chemistry parameters, for the lipid parameters (fasting HDL

cholesterol, fasting LDL cholesterol, fasting total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio, or fasting 
glucose), or for the liver-related laboratory tests (AST, ALT, bilirubin [direct, indirect and total]). 
Renal Laboratory Parameters 
An increase from baseline in serum creatinine was observed from Week 2 onwards (mean change 
0.09 mg/dL, the increase remained stable till Week 24 (mean change 0.12 mg/dL). 
The mean changes from baseline in the eGFR were calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault method 
(eGFRCG), the modification of diet in renal disease method (eGFRMDRD), and by cystatin C clearance 
(eGFRCC). When using eGFR based on creatinine clearance (eGFRCG and eGFRMDRD), a decrease 
was noted from Week 2 onwards, the level remained relatively stable from then onwards. 
The mean (SD) eGFRCG change from baseline was -9.6 (13.7) mL/min at Week 2, and – 11.5 (15.5) 
mL/min at Week 24. However, the eGFR calculated by cystatin C clearance (eGFRCC) did not change 
significantly over time. These results are consistent with the known COBI inhibitory effects on renal 
tubular creatinine secretion and an absence of effect on the glomerular filtration. 
Incidence of Laboratory Abnormalities 
The majority of grade 3 or 4 clinical laboratory abnormalities were associated with changes in creatine 
kinase (18 subjects or 5.8%) and ALT (7 subjects or 2.3%). All other grade 3 or 4 abnormalities 
occurred in less than 2% of subjects. There were no grade 3 or 4 abnormalities in creatinine levels. 
Creatinine was abnormally high in 23 subjects (7.4%), the increase was grade 1 in 22 subjects 
(7.1%) and grade 2 in 1 subject (0.3%). All graded creatinine levels were observed in 
treatment-naïve subjects, except for 1 grade 1 abnormality in a treatment-experienced subject.

None of the laboratory-related AEs were reported as serious, and there were no permanent treatment 
discontinuations due to a laboratory-related AE in the Week-24 analysis of the study. 
Hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia were the most frequent AEs, experienced by 4 
subjects (1.3%) each. Increased blood creatinine was reported as an AE in 3 subjects (1.0%). In 1 of 
these subjects, this AE was considered related to DRV/COBI; the increased creatinine levels resolved 
with continued treatment. Other laboratory-related AEs considered by the investigator to be related 
to DRV/COBI were neutropenia, anemia, and hyperlipasemia. The events of neutropenia and anaemia 
resolved; the AE of hyperlipaemia was on-going at time of report writing, although the laboratory 
abnormality resolved with continued treatment and there was no report of pancreatitis.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Fifteen subjects (4.8%) discontinued the study drugs due to an AE. Most AEs leading to 
discontinuation were in the SOC of Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders (7 subjects; 2.2%). 
The most common AEs that led to discontinuation were rash (preferred term) and maculo-papular 
rash, both of which were experienced by 3 subjects each (1.0%). Nausea and hypersensitivity each 
resulted in discontinuation of 2 subjects (0.6%). All AEs that led to discontinuation were considered 
by the investigators to be study drug-related, except for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and 
mycobacterium avium complex infection.

Incidence of Adverse Events Leading to Permanent Discontinuation – 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of the DRV/COBI FDC is based mainly on the data from the Phase 3b study 
GS-US-216-0130 in HIV-1 infected subjects and data from the Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects 
(TMC114IFD1001 and TMC114IFD1003). The safety profile of DRV given in combination with rtv and 
COBI given alone were also provided in support. 
Overall therefore approximately 480 subjects have been exposed to DRV/COBI given as single entities 
with an median duration of exposure of about 31 weeks and 169 subjects have been exposed to the 
FDC for a period of 10 days only, it would appear that no subjects have been exposed to DRV/cobi for 
up to or beyond a year. Apparently around 78 subjects have also been exposed to DRV/cobi in studies 
conducted by Gilead, however these were not included in this application.  
In the phase 1 studies in which the FDC was used, the most frequent adverse events were headache, 
fatigue, diarrhoea, nausea, skin irritation, pruritus and muscle fatigue.  
In the phase 3b study GS-US-216-0130, the most frequently occurring AEs (in >5% of all subjects) 
were diarrhea (24.9%), nausea (21.4%), upper respiratory tract infection (9.9%), headache (9.3%), 
rash (preferred term, 8.6%), vomiting (8.3%), fatigue (6.4%), flatulence (6.1%), nasopharyngitis 
(5.8%) and sinusitis (5.4%). Adverse events considered at least possibly related to study medication 
by the investigator were reported for 39,3 %  of subjects. 
Particularly striking is the high incidence of rash. In the Week-48 analysis from study 
GS-US-216-0130, rash (ADR) was reported for 49 subjects (42 out of 49 subjects with rash did not 
discontinue the study; these 42 subjects had grade 1 or 2 rash – of the seven subjects who did 
discontinue, two subjects experienced a grade 3 rash).

800/100 mg once daily arm of TMC114-C211 and TMC114-C229 (Week 48 analysis). 
Detailed analysis of the ADR rash in GS-US-216-130 and in the DRV/rtv 
For registration of COBI as a pharmaco-enhancer of DRV no comparative study has been submitted. 
However, for the registration of COBI as booster of another PI, a comparative study has been 
performed, GS-US-216-0114 that compared ATV/COBI+Truvada (n=394) with ATV/RTV+Truvada 
(n=377). In that direct comparison of COBI versus RTV in both arms 6.1% of subjects experienced 
rash, thus COBI itself does not seem to be particularly prone to hypersensitivity disorders or rashes 
when compared to RTV. PK parameters were available for 60 subjects in study GS-US-216-0130. Of 
these, 9 subjects presented with a rash (ADR). Comparing the COBI exposures in these subjects to 
those who did not experience a rash provided no evidence of an association between COBI plasma 
concentrations and the presence of rash. 
There were no serious adverse events or deaths reported in the studies. Only a small number of 
subjects discontinued the study drugs due to an adverse event. 
It is considered that there are a few gaps regarding the safety of DRV/rtv given as a FDC or as single 
entities as follows;  
• 
• 
There is a lack of knowledge regarding the long-term safety of DRV/cobi as a FDC or 
administered as single agents. Currently there is up to 48 weeks safety data.  
There is no discussion by the applicant of safety issues which might result from drug-drug 
interactions especially with regards to differences between cobi and rtv. The Marketing 
Authorization Holder (MAH) for the COBI single agent is planning to conduct drug-drug 
interaction studies of COBI-boosted DRV with the estrogen and progestin component of oral 
contraceptives, with rosuvastatin, and with atorvastatin. In case the results of these studies 
warrant an update of the COBI SmPC, the DRV/COBI FDC SmPC will be updated accordingly. 
•  DRV/cobi has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment or renal 
impairment. This is reflected in the SmPC. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Adverse events considered to be of special interest to DRV/COBI were noted to be prevalent in the 
studies conducted with the FDC (Rash [grouped term], 16.3%), Lipid Abnormalities (2.9%) and 
Severe Skin Reactions (2.6%).  
Overall, the data suggest that DRV/COBI is generally well tolerated. No particular concern has been 
identified with this fixed dose combination or DRV/cobi given as single agents to date.

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
• 
• 
• 
The PREZISTA (darunavir) leaflet serves as the parent leaflet for REZOLSTA; 
The proposed REZOLSTA leaflet contains currently approved active ingredients (darunavir 
and cobicistat), for which the individual leaflets have been user tested;

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The most evident benefit of the FDC DRV/COBI is the reduction of pill burden: instead of 2 pills (DRV 
800 mg and ritonavir 100 mg), one single tablet would suffice, in combination with other background 
ARVs. 
The combination DRV/COBI as separate compounds showed high antiviral efficacy (83.7%, viral 
suppression < 50 c/ml) in treatment-naïve subjects at week 24 and adequate immunologic recovery. 
Development of DRV-RAMs was absent in treatment failures in the treatment-naïve subjects. The 
results obtained appear in line with those known for DRV/rtv in treatment-naïve subjects. 
Antiretroviral activity will be optimal in a fixed dose of a PI and its boosting agent, because if either 
one is not adhered to, no antiretroviral activity of DRV (too low dose without boosting) or COBI (lack 
of antiretroviral activity) can be expected. 
No cases of Proximal Tubular Nephrotoxicity (pre-Fanconi) were recorded in the 313 subjects 
receiving COBI mostly in combination with tenofovir that is associated with nephrotoxicity. 
Tenofovir exposures were not higher due to the combined effects of DRV and COBI compared to the 
effects of DRV and RTV, thus that additional risk factor for nephrotoxicity is not present. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The anticipated benefit of increased simplicity of administration with the current FDC might be 
limited: more benefit in simplicity can be achieved when also the background NRTIs, e.g. tenofovir 
and emtricitabine, were combined in the fixed dose combination.  
Although antiviral efficacy appears in line with that known for DRV/rtv, the comparison of data is 
hampered by the lack of a comparator arm DRV/rtv in study GS-US-216-0130.  
Very limited data were obtained about patients failing on other regimens (n=18).  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The study GS-US-216-0130 mainly focused on safety evaluation in 313 subjects during 48 weeks. No 
new Adverse Drug Reactions were recorded that were not yet part of the DRV list of AEs. 
Rash (16%), diarrhoea (28%), nausea (23%) frequently complicate administration DRV/COBI and 
rash resulted in discontinuation in 2% of subjects.   
COBI increases serum creatinine with about 10 nmol/L, due to inhibition of tubular secretion of 
creatinine, whereas RTV does not. 
Next to inhibition of CYP3A4 enzyme COBI also inhibits various other hepatic and transporter enzymes 
which complicates administration of co-medication.

COBI is not lipid neutral. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
A single arm study is not considered as the most optimal design to evaluate safety issues. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The introduction of a new pharmaco-enhancer of DRV in a FDC with DRV is considered a benefit in 
treatment simplification and in prevention of medication errors. Overall, use of COBI as a 
pharmaco-enhancer of DRV results in similar efficacy in treatment-naïve patients compared to use of 
RTV. No new AEs were recorded when COBI instead of RTV was used as a pharmaco-enhancer of DRV. 
COBI has a reduced potential of liver enzyme inhibition compared to RTV.  
Several issues require consideration: 
- 
The introduction of a FDC of DRV and a pharmaco-enhancer is only a marginal contribution in the 
reduction of pill burden, since in the cART-treatment naive patient category it would imply a 
reduction of 3 pills to 2 pills per day, which is not considered a fundamental change or 
breakthrough in simplicity of PI-based regimens, since the backbone is still a separate tablet. 
-  More benefit of increased simplicity of administration of a FDC of DRV and a boosting agent is to 
be achieved in treatment-experienced patients who require DRV/RTV 600/100 mg BID (i.e. 2 
pills twice daily). That would imply a reduction of 4 pills to 2 pills per day. The Applicant has 
mentioned that they will not pursue a twice daily dosing simplification for other 
treatment-experienced populations as COBI is only indicated for once daily use. However there is 
no reason why COBI and DRV/cobi FDC could not be developed for treatment experienced 
patients requiring a twice daily regimen, and the Applicant is encouraged to do so.  
-  Substantial gains in antiretroviral efficacy cannot be expected, because only DRV 800 mg qd will 
be active in this respect and its effective plasma concentration is relatively similar with either 100 
mg rtv or 150 mg COBI.  
In fact, the application of the FDC DRV/COBI 800/150 mg qd based on results from study 
GS-US-216-0130 with DRV+COBI used as separate components is not required to establish the 
antiretroviral activity of DRV, since the separate substances have been approved. Most relevant data 
from this study are therefore related to safety, including nephrotoxicity issues due to interaction of 
COBI and tenofovir. These were however not evident in this study. Further on, a single arm study 
design complicates the interpretation of the observed signals. Increased frequency of patient 
discomfort was recorded: rash (16%) and nausea (23%), compared to data in DRV/RTV (10% and 
16%). 
Finally, COBI shares various interaction pathways with rtv, and commonly prescribed co-medication 
(e.g. contraceptives, beta blockers, methadone) remain subject to inhibition of liver enzymes by COBI, 
complicating management of co-morbidities.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Both substances, DRV and COBI, have already been registered. DRV boosted by RTV has been shown 
to be a potent antiretroviral agent with a high barrier to resistance. A fixed dose combination of DRV 
Assessment report  
EMA/669488/2014 Corr. 1 
Page 98/100 
  
  
 
 
 
combined with its pharmaco-enhancer is a logical step to a future application of a fixed dose 
combination of a protease-inhibitor, its booster and 2 NRTIs. 
In a single arm study in 313 patients that mainly focused on safety of DRV/COBI during 48 weeks no 
new AEs were recorded apart from the known COBI-related increase of creatinine due to inhibition of 
secretion of creatinine in the tubular cells without nephrotoxicity AEs. The incidence of rash and 
nausea may be increased when DRV/COBI is used compared to use of DRV/RTV, but does not seem 
to be related to DRV exposures nor to COBI itself, since in direct comparison of COBI versus RTV in 
other studies these differences were not recorded.  
Efficacy of DRV/COBI once daily was similar to that of DRV/RTV once daily. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
DRV in combination with its pharmaco-enhancer RTV has been approved in HIV patients who are 
ARV-naïve or who have been exposed to other ARVs but do not have DRV resistance associated 
mutations (RAMs) and who have plasma HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) <100,000 copies/mL and CD4+ 
cell count ≥ 100x106 cells/L. COBI has been approved as a pharmaco-enhancer of DRV based on PK 
data. The observed reduction of DRV Ctau of ~30% compared to boosting by RTV, was not associated 
with reduced antiretroviral activity in earlier studies and not in the currently submitted study 
GS-US-216-0130. The bioequivalence study is pivotal in supporting the current submission of the FDC 
DRV/COBI 800/150 mg tablet. 
Extrapolation from the current indication of DRV 800 mg once daily if boosted by RTV seems therefore 
rational for the (fixed dose) combination of DRV/COBI 800/150 mg qd. The confirmatory study 
GS-US-216-0130 in 313 subjects did not show major new safety concerns during the period of 
observation of 48 weeks.  
Antiretroviral efficacy was demonstrated in 295 treatment-naïve subjects, which appeared in line with 
that known for DRV/rtv. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of REZOLSTA “indicated in combination with other antiretroviral 
medicinal products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection in adults 
aged 18 years or older. 
Genotypic testing should guide the use of REZOLSTA (see sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1)” 
is favourable and therefore recommends  the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the

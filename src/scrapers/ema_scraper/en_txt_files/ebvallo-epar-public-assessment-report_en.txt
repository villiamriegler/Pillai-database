1.  Background information on the procedure  
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Atara Biotherapeutics Ireland Limited submitted on 5 November 2021 an application for 
marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Ebvallo, through the centralised 
procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 
Ebvallo, was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/16/1627 on 21 March 2016. Ebvallo 
was designated as an orphan medicinal product in the following indication: treatment of post-
transplant lymphoproliferative disorder.  
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Ebvallo as an orphan medicinal product in the 
approved indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the orphan maintenance 
assessment report published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s website: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/ebvallo. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: treatment of patients with Epstein-Barr virus positive 
post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (EBV+ PTLD) who have received at least one prior therapy. 
For solid organ transplant patients, prior therapy includes chemotherapy unless chemotherapy is 
considered inappropriate. 
1.2.  Legal basis, dossier content 
The legal basis for this application refers to: 
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated 
that tabelecleucel was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies).  
1.3.  Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0490/2020 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP EMEA-002025-PIP04-19 was not yet completed as 
some measures were deferred. 
The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP EMEA-002025-PIP04-19.  
1.4.  Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
1.4.1.   Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication.

1.5.  Applicant’s requests for consideration 
1.5.1.  Marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances 
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances in accordance with Article 14(8) of the above-mentioned Regulation. 
1.5.2.  Accelerated assessment 
The applicant requested accelerated assessment in accordance to Article 14 (9) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004. 
1.5.3.  New active substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance tabelecleucel contained in the above medicinal product to 
be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a 
medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
1.5.4.  Scientific recommendation on classification 
The applicant Atara Biotherapeutics Ireland Limited submitted on 7 April 2016 an application for 
Scientific recommendation on Classification to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Ebvallo, which 
was designated as an Advanced Therapy Medicinal (EMA/CAT/327742/2016) on 30 May 2016.  
1.6.  PRIME 
Ebvallo was granted eligibility to PRIME on 13 October 2016 in the following indication: treatment of 
patients with Epstein-Barr Virus-associated Post Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder in the 
allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation setting. 
Eligibility to PRIME was granted at the time in view of the following: 
There are unmet therapeutic needs for patients with an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated/-related 
post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD); less than half of the patients survive for more 
than 3 years onset of PTLD, anti-CD20 and cytotoxic therapy incur a high treatment burden, and in a 
portion of patients, PTLD becomes refractory to anti-CD20 therapy. 
The HLA-matched, allogeneic EBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (ATA129) represent a novel 
mechanism of action and has the potential to address the unmet therapeutic needs, including when in 
anti-CD20 therapy refractory PTLD. 
In clinical experiments, a complete response has been reported in about half of the patients with an 
anti-CD20 therapy refractory PTLD using ATA129 as single agent. 
Upon granting of eligibility to PRIME, Egbert Flory was appointed by the CHMP as rapporteur. 
A kick-off meeting was held on 9 October 2019. The objective of the meeting was to discuss the 
development programme and regulatory strategy for the product. The applicant was recommended to 
address the following key issues through relevant regulatory procedures:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
The comparability between the different generations of the product that have been used 
throughout the clinical development programme.    
The manufacturing controls, release criteria, and the stability plan for the product. 
The plan for donor HLA selection and matching with patients to be treated. 
The need for non-clinical in vivo studies in addition to any in vitro data that can be generated.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Ebvallo is indicated for the treatment of patients with Epstein-Barr Virus positive post-transplant 
lymphoproliferative disease (EBV+ PTLD) who have received at least one prior therapy. For solid organ 
transplant patients, prior therapy includes chemotherapy unless chemotherapy is considered 
inappropriate. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
EBV+ PTLD is a rare and aggressive haematological malignancy that can occur after solid organ 
transplant (SOT) or haematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) due to immunosuppression that is induced to 
prevent graft rejection. The estimated annual incidence of EBV+ PTLD in the EU is approximately 125 
to 150 patients in the SOT setting and approximately 90 to 140 patients in the HCT setting. 
Several risk factors have been shown to increase the risk of PTLD; these include infection, degree and 
duration of immunosuppression, age and race of recipient, type of allograft, and genetic factors. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
EBV is a DNA virus of the gamma herpes family. More than 90% of the worldwide population are EBV 
positive. In healthy individuals, EBV-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses against viral antigens 
exert immunologic control over long-term infection. B lymphocytes are an important reservoir for EBV. 
The virus can insert its genome into the B cells and can induce uncontrolled B cell proliferation. Once 
the primary infection resolves, the virus persists in resting B cells. In case of immunosuppression after 
solid organ transplantation or haematopoietic stem cell transplantation a consequence is the inhibition 
of anti- EBV-specific CD3 T cells. In this setting, the EBV-infected B cells may proliferate uncontrolled. 
This proliferation might be especially strong when patients are EBV negative and acquire an infection 
when immunosuppressed. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation and prognosis 
Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) are lymphoid and/or plasmacytic proliferations 
that occur in the setting of solid organ or allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation as a result of 
immunosuppression. They are among the most serious and potentially fatal complications of 
transplantation. The majority is related to the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). 
Lymphadenopathy is often absent, and symptoms are usually due to interference with the function of 
involved organs. Classic B symptoms such as pyrexia, sweats, and weight loss can occur. Clinical 
features of PTLD are often non-specific, while extranodal involvement is common, including 
gastrointestinal tract (GIT), lungs, skin, bone marrow (BM), and central nervous system (CNS). Rarely, 
BM involvement can be the only disease site. PTLD typically has a more rapid onset in HSCT patients, 
with median time of 4–6 months after transplant. 
Most PTLD cases are B cell (5–10% T/NK cell or Hodgkin lymphoma), while approximately one-third 
are EBV-negative. World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic categories are: early lesions, 
polymorphic, and monomorphic PTLD; although in practice, a clear separation is not always possible.

2.1.5.  Management 
First-line treatment: 
•  Reduction of immunosuppression is the first step in the therapy of PTLD. It aims to achieve 
control of PTLD by the body's own immune system, but without compromising the function of 
the transplanted organ. With few exceptions, however, the rapid initiation of further 
therapeutic measures is essential. 
•  Rituximab, a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody is used off-label in patients with polymorphic 
PTLD, or monomorphic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma-like PTLD.  
• 
Epstein-Barr virus-specific cytotoxic T-cell therapy. 
Second-line therapy: 
second-line therapy options include cellular therapy (DLI or CTLs) or chemotherapy±rituximab 
(CHOP/R-CHOP). In patients after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, unselected DLI 
from an EBV-positive donor are employed to restore broad T-cell reactivity, including EBV-specific 
responses; unselected DLI, however, can be associated with severe GvHD. However, the use of DLI for 
EBV-PTLD is not recommended in any line of therapy in the most recent National Comprehensive 
Cancer Network non-Hodgkin lymphoma treatment guidelines [NCCN NHL Guidelines, 3.2016] 
The international phase 2 PTLD-1 trial established sequential therapy of 4 cycles of weekly intravenous 
(IV) rituximab at standard dose (375 mg/m2) followed by 4 cycles of standard dose CHOP-21 
chemotherapy (50 mg/m2 doxorubicin; 750 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide, 1.4 mg/m2 vincristine, 50 
mg/m2 prednisolone) every 21 days alongside mandatory granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-
CSF) [Trappe 2012] Although some patients benefit from chemotherapy, it is associated with a high 
treatment-related mortality [Trappe 2017] and both short and long-term adverse effects [Children's 
Oncology Group 2018; Watson 2019]. 
Treatment options for paediatric patients with PTLD follow the same treatment algorithms as adults 
with generally similar outcomes. 
The treatment goal is resolution of all signs and symptoms of PTLD, including a negative viral load. 
Response to rituximab therapy can be identified by a decrease in EBV DNA-aemia of at least 1 log10 in 
the first week of treatment. 
Responses to first-line therapy are not durable in most cases. In the HCT setting, approximately 50% 
of cases fail initial treatment. In patients who fail initial therapy, disease progression is usually rapid 
with poor outcomes. In SOT patients who failed rituximab plus chemotherapy or cannot receive a 
chemotherapy regimen, the median survival was approximately 3 months. In a recent retrospective 
cohort study of 18 HCT subjects, the median survival from diagnosis of rituximab-refractory disease 
was 1.7 months. Analysis of an expanded multinational population in 2021 confirmed these findings: 
Patients with PTLD following HCT who failed rituximab has a median OS of 0.7 months (81 patients); 
patients with PTLD following SOT who failed chemotherapy after initial rituximab had a median OS of 
4.1 months (86 patients).  
2.2.  About the product 
Ebvallo is an allogeneic T cell immunotherapy composed of EBV antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells (EBV-
CTLs). Ebvallo acts with an equivalent mechanism of action to that demonstrated by endogenous 
circulating EBV-CTLs and specifically targets and eliminates cells expressing EBV antigens. Ebvallo is 
generated from high resolution human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-typed EBV+ donor-derived T cells that 
are stimulated with EBV-infected antigen presenting cells, resulting in expansion of the T cells. The

cells are characterised and cryopreserved for future use as an allogeneic T cell immunotherapy. Ebvallo 
exhibits EBV-directed in vitro cytotoxic activity restricted by defined HLA alleles. To produce Ebvallo, 
the EBV-specific T cell reservoir in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from EBV+ donors is expanded 
and differentiated into an enriched oligoclonal population of EBV-specific effector memory T cells by 
multiple ex-vivo cycles of stimulation with a lethally irradiated autologous EBV-transformed B 
lymphoblastoid cell line (BLCL).  
As a verification of potency and specificity, Ebvallo is required to have a detected class I (CD8) HLA 
restriction of EBV-specific cytotoxicity, which enables Ebvallo to detect and eliminate EBV+ cells. 
2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development 
The CHMP and CAT agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on reported beneficial effects in the 
pivotal study, including potential prolongation of survival in patients treated with Ebvallo.  
The advantage compared to available treatments was based on results available from historical 
controls obtained from the literature.  
However, during assessment the CAT and CHMP concluded that it was no longer appropriate to pursue 
accelerated assessment, as after the initial evaluation of this application a number of significant 
uncertainties related to the safety profile of the product and a detailed plan on how to address these 
were identified. In addition evidence of GMP compliance was also required at that stage for a number 
of manufacturing sites for the product.  
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Marketing Authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances in accordance with Article 14(8) of the above-mentioned Regulation based on:  
The rarity of the disease 
The challenges in recruiting EBV+ PTLD patients in clinical trials 
The significant unmet need in EBV+ PTLD patients following either HCT or SOT who do not 
respond to or relapse after initial therapy given the lack of approved therapies and rapid 
decline with high mortality after initial treatment. 
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as dispersion for injection containing 2.8 × 107 – 7.3 × 107 cells/mL 
of tabelecleucel as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), human serum albumin (HSA), phosphate buffered 
saline (PBS).  
The product is available in cyclo-olefin copolymer stoppered vials with a thermoplastic elastomer 
closure containing 1.2 mL (2 mL vial) to ensure a minimum of 1 mL deliverable volume. Vials are 
packaged in a carton. The total number of vials in each carton (between 1 vial and 6 vials) corresponds 
to the dosing requirement for each individual patient.

2.4.2.  Active substance 
2.4.2.1.  General Information 
Tabelecleucel is an allogeneic T cell immunotherapy product composed of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) 
antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells (EBV-CTLs) stimulated, expanded and enriched ex vivo using EBV 
reagent and B lymphoblastoid cell line (BLCL) antigen presenting cells (BLCL APC). The finished 
product is derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a single donor using BLCL 
APC generated from the same donor. Each finished product batch has a human leukocyte antigen 
(HLA) restriction to be used for selection for individual patients. Several finished product batches with 
different HLA restrictions build up a product batch inventory.  
The active substance (International non-proprietary name: tabelecleucel) is EBV - specific cytotoxic T 
lymphocytes, which are CD3+ T cells that specifically lyse target cells presenting EBV antigens in 
complex with a HLA to which the EBV-CTL is restricted.  
The structural and physicochemical properties have adequately been described. Since tabelecleucel is a 
cell-based product most physicochemical characteristics relevant for e.g. recombinant proteins are not 
applicable. The mechanism of action has been described as relying on the cytotoxicity of tabelecleucel 
toward malignant EBV-infected cells of the patient. Sufficient information was provided. 
2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
Manufacturers 
The sites responsible for manufacturing and testing of the PBMC intermediate, active substance and 
finished product have been outlined in the dossier. The active substance is manufactured at Charles 
River Laboratories, Inc., Memphis, USA. 
During the procedure a major objection was raised due to the absence of EU GMP certificates for 
several of the manufacturing and testing sites. Following completion of the relevant EU GMP 
inspections and submission of the requested GMP certificates this major objection has been 
satisfactorily resolved.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The manufacturing of tabelecleucel is comprised of five process stages: 1) Preparation of purified PBMC 
intermediate; 2) Transformation of the B-cell component of the autologous PBMC intermediate with 
EBV reagent (preparation of BLCL reagent); 3) Expansion and irradiation of BLCL cells (preparation of 
BLCL APC reagent); 4) Stimulation and expansion of EBV-specific T-cells by co-culture with BLCL APC, 
followed by harvest, wash and formulation in cryopreservation solution; 5) After active substance in-
process control (IPC) testing, final fill and finish is performed followed by cryopreservation to yield the 
finished product. 
No distinct active substance that is stored and tested is defined in the tabelecleucel manufacturing 
process as the process is continuous from PBMC intermediate through finished product. The active 
substance manufacturing process description includes the manufacture of PBMC intermediate from 
leukapheresis collection starting material through EBV-CTL formulated bulk active substance. 
The active substance manufacturing process encompasses two segments: a core active substance (and 
finished product) process stream and a reagents process stream. The reagent process stream serves to 
produce the BLCL APCs that are used for selective stimulation and expansion of the desired final 
cytotoxic T cells. Further information related to the BLCL reagents is provided in the control of 
materials section. 
Assessment report  
EMA/858618/2022  
Page 14/87 
 
 
 
A detailed overview of the manufacture and control of the PBMC intermediate has been provided. The 
leukapheresis starting material is collected at qualified sites and shipped to Charles River Laboratories, 
Inc. for subsequent manufacture of PBMC intermediate. This intermediate is used for the manufacture 
of the active substance.  
The manufacturing process has been adequately described, including the associated critical process 
parameters (CPPs), non-critical key process parameter (NCKs), IPCs and in-process tests (IPTs). The 
associated acceptance range and target values for each CPP and NCK have been listed.  
Cell concentration and viability is continuously measured during the cell culture. Samples for 
mycoplasma and adventitious viruses are used for finished product release.  
The applicant sufficiently described the manufacture of finished product including the PBMC 
intermediate.  
Control of materials 
For all non-compendial materials specifications, including tests and acceptance criteria, have been set. 
The source (supplier/vendor) for each raw material has been presented.  
The composition of formulated media, buffers and solutions has been detailed by the applicant, and 
their use in the manufacturing process steps has been specified. 
BLCL APC reagent 
The BLCL APC reagent is an EBV transformed B cell line used to stimulate autologous PBMCs. BLCLs and 
PBMCs are derived from the same leukapheresis donation. The BLCL APC reagent is obtained from the 
BLCL reagent by expansion in cell culture. 
The  manufacture  of  the  BLCL  APC  reagent  from  the  BLCL  reagent  has  been  adequately  described. 
Throughout the expansion process cell concentration and viability is measured.  
BLCL reagent 
The manufacturing process of the BLCL reagent has been sufficiently described, and suitable IPCs have 
been established. PBMCs are infected with the EBV reagent followed by expansion of the culture for a 
defined time period. Finally, formulation and filling of the harvest is carried out.  
For the release of BLCL reagent the control of relevant quality attributes such as identity, purity, 
strength and safety (sterility, endotoxin, and mycoplasma testing) has been established. Acceptable 
justification of specification for the BLCL reagent was provided. Based on the currently available 
stability data a shelf life has been established for the BLCL reagent. 
EBV 
The EBV producer cell line, derived from a primate B cell line transformed with EBV, master cell bank 
(MCB) is used directly to seed cell culture for the production of EBV reagent. A description on source, 
history and generation of MCB has been provided.  
Testing of the MCB and limit of in vitro cell age (LIVCA) cells for adventitious and endogenous viruses is 
in line with ICH Q5A and Ph. Eur. 5.2.3 and is deemed sufficient. No viruses have been found in either 
the MCB or LIVCA cells.  
The EBV reagent manufacturing process was described. Manufacture is controlled by appropriate IPCs. 
The  EBV  reagent  is  tested  on  the  harvest  for  adventitious  viruses.  The  testing  is  in  line  with  Ph.Eur. 
2.6.16 requirements and is deemed sufficient. 
Assessment report  
EMA/858618/2022  
Page 15/87 
 
 
 
The EBV reagent specification includes tests for identity, purity, potency, sterility, endotoxin and 
mycoplasma.  
The testing performance for adventitious and endogenous viruses has been described, and data on 
assay qualification are provided.  
The proposed shelf-life for the EBV reagent is acceptable. 
Leukapheresis, donor testing 
Testing of the allogeneic donors follows EU Directives for blood and cells/tissues, i.e. Directive 
2002/98/EC and its implementing Directive 2004/33/EC as well as Directive 2004/23/EC and its 
implementing Directive 2006/17/EC. 
IDM testing was and will be performed exclusively with CE-labelled IVDs in laboratories in the EU.  
The infectious disease marker panel is appropriate. All tested markers must be negative with exception 
for CMV. PBMCs from CMV positive donors (IgG, IgM, NAT) may be used for tabelecleucel manufacture. 
The finished product will be labelled with the donor’s CMV status. In addition, appropriate questions for 
minimising the risk for human TSE are also implemented. 
Future changes may occur related to the introduction of batches (with different HLA genotypes and 
HLA restrictions) manufactured from new donors in a new country and/or different region with 
significantly different pattern of infection disease. In this perspective, a variation will be submitted for 
evaluation of the revised adventitious agent risk assessment and consequent update of the viral safety 
testing programme. 
Information on the shipping process of the donor samples for IDM testing to the EU testing laboratory 
have been provided giving sufficient assurance on the appropriateness of the shipping conditions. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Active substance 
The applicant classified process parameters either into critical or non-critical. A complete list of process 
parameters as occurring during manufacture was included. Acceptable ranges have been defined for all 
parameters and IPCs. A summary of the validation parameters and validation results was provided for 
the IPC analytical methods.  
PBMC intermediate 
For the PBMC intermediate critical and non-critical process parameters have been presented together 
with IPCs.  
The PBMC specification includes appearance, sterility, viable cell concentration, viability, endotoxin, 
HLA type. Appropriate justification for each attribute was provided.  
The quality of the PBMC intermediate is sufficiently controlled. All batches shown are within 
specification.  
Long-term stability of the PBMC intermediate will be assessed for the duration of the study. The 
currently available real-time stability data support the established shelf life. The stability data for all 
batches tested are within specification. 
Certificate of analysis (CoA) of vials confirming sterility has been provided. The same container closure 
system is used for the storage of BLCL reagent.  
Assessment report  
EMA/858618/2022  
Page 16/87 
 
 
 
Process validation and/or evaluation 
For manufacturing process validation the applicant applied a consecutive validation approach, starting 
with the validation of PBMC manufacture. This section specifically covers the validation of the PBMC 
manufacture. Validation of the active substance/finished product manufacture is discussed in the 
finished product section.  
PBMC PPQ lots were manufactured and all fulfilled the release criteria. Critical and key process 
parameters were fulfilled for each batch. The validation of PBMC manufacture is considered sufficient.  
The PBMC aseptic validation is considered sufficient. 
Shipping of leukaphereses has been sufficiently validated.  
PBMC shipment was sufficiently validated. 
Manufacturing process development  
Active substance process characterisation 
Manufacturing process version PV1 and the associated batch release test methods have been 
developed and performed at the original manufacturer over the course of approximately twenty years. 
The manufacturing process was transferred for the late-stage clinical development and 
commercialisation. As the manufacturing process was transferred, the process was scaled-up and 
improved with a process version PV2 and then process version PV3. 
Within PV3, the further process versions are defined based on manufacturing site and use of different 
EBV reagent versions.  
The approach to demonstrate comparability of product manufactured by PV1, PV2, PV3 is further 
discussed in the finished product section. 
EBV reagent comparability 
Analytical comparability of EBV reagent supplies manufactured at different locations was assessed. All 
EBV reagents were manufactured using the same cell line.  
A statistical rationale is provided for the comparability margins.  
Characterisation 
Various characterisation studies have been performed on multiple batches produced by PV2 and PV3 
manufacturing processes.  
Characterisation studies confirm that tabelecleucel is predominantly a TCRα/β+CD45RO+CCR7- 
effector memory T cell (CD3+) population comprised of CD8+ cells, and to a lesser degree CD4+ cells, 
that have demonstrated cytotoxicity to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-antigen presenting targets. 
Tabelecleucel is comprised of an enriched EBV-specific effector T cell population that is cytotoxic 
toward autologous EBV antigen-positive target cells as well as toward allogeneic EBV antigen-positive 
target cells matched to at least one HLA restriction of tabelecleucel (restricting allele).  
Impurities  
Impurities have not been characterised at the active substance level. The theoretical and actual 
impurities observed in tabelecleucel are discussed below although they were addressed in the finished 
product part of the dossier. 
A list of all process- and product-related impurities was presented.  
Assessment report  
EMA/858618/2022  
Page 17/87 
 
 
 
The irradiation dose ensures that no replication competent BLCLs are introduced into the finished 
product. The ability of residual EBV to infect PBMCs or cord blood cells has been addressed in the non-
clinical part of the dossier. 
The washing steps efficiently removed medium components The levels of monocytes, granulocytes, B 
cells, and NK cells were shown to be low. 
2.4.2.3.  Specification  
No distinct active substance that is stored and tested is defined in the tabelecleucel manufacturing 
process since the process is continuous. Therefore, specification, analytical procedures, batch analyses, 
reference standards, and container closure system information is provided only in the finished product 
section. 
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
As the active substance is immediately processed to finished product without a hold step, no active 
substance stability data has been submitted, which is acceptable.  
2.4.3.  Finished medicinal product  
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
Each vial of tabelecleucel contains a target concentration of 5 x 107 viable T cells/mL (acceptable range 
2.8 × 107 – 7.3 × 107 cells/mL) with DMSO and HSA in a buffered saline solution. The excipients used 
in the final formulation are commonly used for cell therapy product formulations. After thawing, 
tabelecleucel needs to be diluted with commercially available multiple electrolytes solution for injection 
(pH 7.4) before injection by healthcare professionals. 
There is no overage in the tabelecleucel formulation. Vials are overfilled to 1.2 mL to ensure that there 
is a sufficient withdrawable dose of 1.0 mL in each vial. 
The compatibility of the excipients with the CTLs has been demonstrated through formulation 
development studies. The information presented describes the compatibility of excipients with CTLs 
across a range of concentrations and hold times. 
The proposed commercial formulation has been used for all process versions and throughout clinical 
development.  
Manufacturing process development 
CQAs were identified through a risk-based approach, taking into account impact and uncertainty. A list 
of attributes belonging to categories general (e.g. appearance, pH), safety, strength, potency, purity 
and identity were assessed by the applicant and defined as either CQA, potential CQA, or non-CQA. 
The presented approach is considered acceptable. It was further outlined by the applicant how each 
attribute is controlled during manufacture and release. 
Comparability studies  
Please refer also to the active substance section for details on the different processes. The applicant 
has conducted comprehensive analytical comparability studies to assess: 
1. Comparability of the product manufactured with the commercial process to product manufactured 
with the PV3 processes used in the pivotal clinical trial. 
2. Comparability of the product manufactured with PV1 to clinically used product. 
Assessment report  
EMA/858618/2022  
Page 18/87 
 
 
 
The current comparability strategy lacks process version 2 (PV2) product batches. Only a few batches 
of PV2 were used in the clinical development. Since these were not used in the pivotal study it can be 
agreed that the impact of not assessing comparability between PV1 and PV2 has minimal impact on the 
interpretation of efficacy. It is expected that no further PV2 batches will be used in the future. 
The assignment of quality attributes into two tiers representing critical ones or characterisation 
attributes/attributes not associated with quantitative potency, safety, purity is acceptable.  
The statistical testing for equivalence is endorsed and general considerations presented by the 
applicant on the overlap of distributions are in principle supported.  
Comparability of PV1 material to clinically used PV3 material 
The applicant provided evidence that the batches used for comparability purposes are representative of 
all PV1 batches.  
Altogether, clinical data derived from PV1 batches can be considered suitable for supporting clinical 
data obtained from the pivotal study. 
Comparability of commercial material to clinically used PV3 material  
All quality attributes were comparable although a statistically significant difference was observed for 
some attributes. It can be agreed that these differences are not of practical importance. Comparability 
of commercial material to the clinically used material is considered to be shown. 
Container closure 
The primary container closure system consists of the 2 mL vial and a cap. The vial comprises a cyclo-
olefin copolymer vial body with a pre-sealed thermoplastic elastomer stopper. The filled and re-sealed 
vial is fitted with a single-use cap assuring a tamper evident closure. 
The Vial/Stopper system consist of the bottom ring, vial body, stopper and top ring.  
The supplier of the container closure system is indicated. Specifications of the primary packaging 
components are provided, as well as schematic drawings. A certificate of conformity has been 
provided. 
The container closure system is sterilised by gamma irradiation. A sterility assurance level (SAL) of 10-
6 is achieved according to presented certificate of conformity.  
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacturers 
For details of the sites responsible for manufacturing, testing and release of the finished product have 
been outlined in the dossier. Batch release is performed at Fisher Clinical Services GmbH, Weil am 
Rhein, Germany. 
Exemption from EU batch release testing 
The applicant applied for an exemption from finished product batch release testing in the EU. An 
exemption from the requirement for EU release testing is considered justified in view of the limited 
amount of material available.  
Assessment report  
EMA/858618/2022  
Page 19/87 
 
 
 
Manufacturing process and process controls 
The manufacturing process is a continuous process without a defined active substance hold step. The 
applicant has described in the active substance section the manufacture up to the level of bulk active 
substance ahead of formulation and filling. This is acceptable.  
The finished product manufacturing process consists of filling, inspection, labelling and 
cryopreservation. 
Process characterisation and validation 
Validation of the freezing process was executed. All vials derived from the validation batches passed 
the specification. Validation is considered acceptable. Aseptic processing is requalified regularly.  
Shipper thermal operational qualification was done via (i) temperature simulations and (ii) real 
shipments. In summary, shipping validation is considered appropriate. 
For process validation multiple PPQ batches were manufactured at the commercial manufacturing site. 
All process parameters and IPCs were fulfilled for each batch. The filling process was successful for all 
batches as verified by fill volume check.  
To qualify labelling, packaging and handling primary vial integrity was tested. Transport from liquid 
nitrogen to shipper was also successfully validated. 
In conclusion, the overall manufacturing process (refer also to the active substance section) is 
considered adequately validated. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
The finished product specification is provided. Quality categories and associated attributes include 
general (appearance, pH, osmolality), strength (fill volume, viable cell concentration), purity (viability), 
identity (immunophenotype, HLA type, HLA restriction), potency (T cell proliferation by fold expansion 
assay, EBV specificity by 51Cr release assay), safety (alloreactivity, EBV impurity, particulates, sterility, 
endotoxin, mycoplasma, and in vitro adventitious viruses). The presented specification is considered 
appropriate to control the quality of the finished product. 
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed (as requested) considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions 
and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the 
information provided it is accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine 
impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no additional control 
measures are deemed necessary. 
Analytical methods 
Verification of the methods according to Ph.Eur. was sufficiently performed.  
Non-compendial methods have been appropriately validated. 
Batch analyses 
Batch release data have been provided for the batches currently available for commercial distribution. 
All batches met the release specification criteria. 
Assessment report  
EMA/858618/2022  
Page 20/87 
 
 
 
Reference materials 
No unique reference standards exist for calculating quantitative results. This is acknowledged considering 
the donor-specificity of each product batch.  
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
A shelf-life of 4 years when stored in the vapour phase of liquid nitrogen at ≤ -150°C is proposed by the 
applicant. Based on the presented stability data this shelf-life is justified. 
The stability studies are carried out in accordance with current guidelines. Stability studies are 
performed at the long-term storage condition and accelerated storage condition. Long-term stability 
data of commercial batches and clinical batches are provided. Also, stress stability studies and in-use 
stability studies were performed.    
All batches in the long-term stability programme were manufactured at the proposed commercial 
manufacturing site using the intended commercial formulation and container closure. 
Evaluation of test attributes including appearance, viable cell concentration, viability, T-cell 
proliferation potential, sterility, particulates and pH confirms that the finished product remains within 
the acceptance criteria during long term storage. No significant trend in any attribute has been 
observed at the long-term storage condition and all batches have met all stability protocol acceptance 
criteria. 
An in-use stability study was conducted. The applicant’s conclusion that the finished product is stable at 
room temperature for a cumulative total of 3 hours from start of the thaw is acceptable. 
Photostability studies were not included in the stability programme, based on the proposed storage 
condition (stored in vapor phase cryogenic nitrogen at ≤ -150°C, preventing exposure to light). This is 
considered acceptable. The SmPC includes a statement that the product should be protected from light 
when stored at room temperature after thawing. 
A commitment is made to continue the ongoing long-term stability studies and accelerated studies for 
the finished product. In addition, one finished product batch per year will be placed on  stability. This 
commitment is considered acceptable. 
In conclusion, based on the presented stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 4 years when stored in 
the vapour phase of liquid nitrogen at ≤ -150°C is considered acceptable. 
2.4.3.5.  Post approval protocol 
In module 3.2.R the applicant has provided information on the drug product inventory (DPI). The DPI 
is comprised of individual finished product batches of tabelecleucel of diverse HLA genotypes and 
confirmed HLA restrictions. The applicant states that finished product batches with replacement and/or 
incrementally different HLA genotypes and HLA restrictions manufactured and released per procedures 
described in the approved marketing application will be added into the inventory post-approval. A 
protocol for such additions has also been included in 3.2.R (this is however not formally a post 
approval change management protocol). In view of the need to make new batches available without 
delay, the applicant considers prior approval unfeasible and proposes notifications on an annual basis. 
In principle it is acceptable that batches with different HLA genotypes and HLA restrictions 
manufactured from new donors will be added post-approval without prior assessment for each 
batch. The applicant has demonstrated that consistent finished product quality is achieved with donors 
displaying different HLA alleles. Manufacturing of batches derived from a variety of different donors is 
controlled by critical and key process parameters, in-process controls, and specifications, thereby 
Assessment report  
EMA/858618/2022  
Page 21/87 
 
 
 
resulting in consistent finished product quality. In case an HLA-associated factor would negatively 
impact on finished product quality the existing manufacturing controls and release testing would 
prevent release and use in patients.  
In conclusion, the inclusion of new batches in the DPI without prior assessment is acceptable. 
However, the applicant is recommended to present batch data for the newly included batches for 
review on an annual basis (Recommendation 3). 
2.4.3.6.  Adventitious agents 
The final product consists of living cells, therefore, virus inactivation steps cannot be implemented in 
the tabelecleucel manufacturing process. The overall TSE and virus safety strategy thus relies on the 
careful selection, control, testing of raw materials and inactivation procedures applied to them, testing 
of the PBMC donors as well as testing of tabelecleucel intermediates such as EBV reagent and its 
production cell bank and of the finished product testing. 
Several human and animal-derived materials, besides the human donor PBMCs, are included in the 
manufacturing process of tabelecleucel. HSA is also used as excipient. The HSA is an approved product 
in the EU and reference to a plasma master file (PMF) is provided. For all human-derived materials, 
implementation of a full traceability system from the donor to the tabelecleucel finished product and 
vice versa is implemented. 
The EBV reagent used for generation of BLCL APCs is produced from a cell line which permanently 
produces infectious EBV. Genealogy of the cell line including information on which animal and human 
raw materials were used in its development have been sufficiently described. The MCB used for 
production of the commercial EBV reagent as well as an end-of-production cell bank were generated 
and tested for adventitious viruses according to ICH Q5A and Ph. Eur. 5.2.3 requirements. No viruses 
have been found in either cell bank, therefore, the use of the MCB in the manufacture of the EBV 
reagent is acceptable. 
Data have been submitted to demonstrate adequate capability of tabelecleucel manufacturing process 
steps to remove EBV. 
In conclusion, information has been provided to give sufficient reassurance in relation to viral/TSE 
safety. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
During the procedure a major objection was raised due to the absence of EU GMP certificates for 
several of the manufacturing and testing sites. Following completion of the relevant EU GMP 
inspections and submission of the requested GMP certificates this major objection has been 
satisfactorily resolved. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no 
impact on the benefit/risk ratio of the product, which include control of the EBV reagent, control of a 
material of human origin used in the manufacturing process, and reporting of data for new batches 
added to the DPI. These points are put forward and agreed as recommendations for future quality 
development (see below).  
Assessment report  
EMA/858618/2022  
Page 22/87 
 
 
 
To manage the inclusion of new batches in the DPI during the post-authorisation lifecycle of the product 
it has been agreed that the applicant will present batch data for the newly included batches for review 
on an annual basis (see Recommendation 3). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
The CHMP endorses the CAT assessment regarding the conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical 
and biological aspects as described above. 
2.4.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends some points for investigation. 
The  CHMP  endorses  the  CAT  assessment  regarding  the  recommendation(s)  for  future  quality 
development as described above. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Tabelecleucel is an allogeneic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific T-cell immunotherapy which targets 
and eliminates EBV-positive cells in a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted manner. The Ebvallo 
manufacturing process uses human- and animal-derived materials. Ebvallo is tested for specificity of 
lysis of EBV+ targets, T-cell HLA restriction of specific lysis, and verification of low alloreactivity. 
Ebvallo is selected for each patient from the existing product inventory based on an appropriate HLA 
restriction. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
The pharmacological action of tabelecleucel has been extensively reported in literature [Doubrovina 
2012; Lacerda 1996; O'Reilly 2016]. Tabelecleucel cytolytic function is accomplished by the formation 
of an immune-stimulatory synapse, comprised of a tripartite interaction between the T cell receptor 
(TCR) of a given tabelecleucel T cell clone, and an EBV-epitope in complex with an HLA molecule on 
the target cell. The specific HLA molecule expressed on the target cell that “presents” the EBV epitope 
to the TCR is also referred to as the restricting HLA allele. Similarly, the epitope, or EBV antigen 
peptide sequence presented by the specific HLA molecule, is referred to as a restricting epitope. 
Stimulation of the TCR through this tripartite synapse results in a degranulation event by the T cell 
delivering perforin and granzymes to the target cell and resulting in enzymatic degradation and 
apoptosis of the target. Expression of FAS ligand on tabelecleucel also facilitates ligand mediated 
apoptosis of the target cell through activation of an extrinsic apoptotic cascade following co-localisation 
between tabelecleucel and target cells mediated through the same TCR interactions [Russell 2002].

2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Study Number: PHRM-RPT-129-1005 
Study Title: Evaluation of the contribution of CD4 and CD8 component parts to the EBV-
specific cytotoxicity of ATA129  
The goal of the study was to elucidate whether isolated CD4+ or CD8+ fractions of an ATA129 lot 
contribute to the overall cytotoxic activity of the product. In process ATA129 product was received on 
Day 27 of ongoing culture and was separated into CD4 and CD8 enriched fractions.  
Expression of CD4 and CD8 on CD3+ live cells on unseparated ATA129 was found to be 8.3% CD8+ 
and 88.2% CD4+ (Expression of CD4 and CD8 on CD3+ live cells on untouched CD4+ was found to be 
1.24% CD8+ and 96.6%% CD4+, equating to an approximate 90% efficiency in CD8 depletion. 
Expression of CD4 and CD8 on CD3+ live cells on untouched CD8+ was found to be 79.5% CD8+ and 
10.9% CD4+), equating to an approximate 90% efficiency in CD4 depletion (Figure 1).

Cytotoxicity was performed on autologous chromium-labelled EBV B-lymphocyte cell lines (EBV BLCL, 
the raw material to stimulate EBV-specific CTLs) on Day 27 (Figure 2).

In vivo experiments  
Human Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-Specific Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes Home Preferentially to 
and Induce Selective Regressions of Autologous EBV-induced B Cell Lymphoproliferation in 
Xenografted C.B-17 SCID/SCID Mice [Lacerda 1996] 
Mutant C.B-17 mice homozygous for the autosomal recessive mutation (SCID mice) are severely 
deficient in B and T cells. Because SCID mice are unable to generate functional lymphocytes, 
engraftment and growth of human lymphocytes and several human tumours are possible. Human 
lymphocytes have been shown to remain functional in SCID mice after adoptive transfer. Inoculation of 
SCID mice with EBV+ BLCL results in development of EBV-induced immunoblastic B cell lymphomas 
with characteristics similar to EBV-PTLD arising in immunocompromised hosts [Rowe 1991]. 
Furthermore, SCID mice were used to evaluate the anti-lymphoma activity of different human effector 
cell populations [Schmidt-Wolf 1991]. The primary goal of this study was to assess in-vivo homing and 
EBV specificity and efficacy of tabelecleucel in the presence or absence of IL-2. 
In the experiments described below, SCID mice were treated intraperitoneally (IP) with rabbit anti-
asialo GM1 antiserum on days 1, 4, 8, and every 5 to 7 days thereafter, to deplete endogenous NK cell 
function. Mice were inoculated with EBV+ BLCL on day 1 followed by administration of tabelecleucel to 
mice in each treatment group.  
SCID mice inoculated IP with autologous (donor 1) but not with HLA-mismatched (donor 2) EBV+ BLCL 
had significantly improved survival relative to untreated mice after IP inoculation of tabelecleucel (p < 
0.001). Of these animals inoculated with autologous EBV+ BLCL and then treated with tabelecleucel, 2 
of 5 survived long-term without ever developing lymphomas. Thereafter, the authors investigated 
whether the IV infusion of tabelecleucel would also mediate a therapeutic effect. The IV inoculation of 
107 EBV-specific CTL resulted in improved survival of SCID mice (n = 5) (p < 0.001) relative to 
untreated animals (n = 10)  
Assessment report  
EMA/858618/2022  
Page 26/87 
 
 
 
 
 
The authors investigated whether tabelecleucel might require IL-2 support for prolonged in vivo 
survival in the IP and SC EBV+ SCID mouse model. Both tabelecleucel and tabelecleucel-plus-IL-2-
treated mice survived significantly longer than untreated animals (p < 0.001 and p = 0.02, 
respectively) or animals treated with IL-2 alone (p = 0.004 and p < 0.004, respectively). Three of the 
5 mice treated with both IL-2 and tabelecleucel ultimately died of lymphoma, but onset was delayed 
compared to all other groups. Furthermore, SCID mice bearing large SC EBV+ tumours (~80 mm2) 
and treated IV with tabelecleucel or tabelecleucel-plus-IL-2 at a dose of 107 cells achieved complete 
tumour regression. Two of 5 mice in each group had complete tumour regression and survived > 5 
months after tabelecleucel treatment. 
Preferential  homing  of  PKH26  fluorescent-labelled  tabelecleucel  to  autologous  EBV+  tumours  was 
observed as early as 24 hours after IV adoptive transfer; homing to HLA-mismatched EBV+ tumours 
was  not  observed  (data  not  shown).  Immunophenotypic  analyses  also  demonstrated  preferential 
infiltration  of  T  cells  into  the  autologous  EBV+  tumour  in  SCID  mice  bearing  both  the  autologous  or 
genotypically  related  haplotype-sharing  EBV+  tumours.  The  human  T  cells  infiltrating  EBV+  tumours 
were CD3+ and predominantly CD8+CD4-.   
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
There is no known measurable off-target or on-target off-tumour pharmacodynamics of tabelecleucel 
in either clinical investigations or non-clinical models. Based on clinical study results with tabelecleucel 
and nonclinical studies completed to date, no unexpected effects on the pharmacodynamics were 
observed which could have warranted additional investigation through secondary pharmacodynamic 
studies. 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology studies were not conducted due to the species-specific nature of tabelecleucel 
and the limited applicability of non-human toxicology models.  
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Considering  that  Rituximab  is  an  anti-CD20  used  as  a  front-line  treatment  for  B-cell  malignancies, 
potential drug-drug interaction could interfere with EBV-CTLs (referred to as ATA 129 PV2A in this study) 
if CD20 is expressed on the CTLs cell therapy product. 
Flow cytometric evaluation showed that CD20 was highly expressed on BLCL (88-4%-94.5%; n=2) 
Conversely, BLCL did not express CD3 marker (0.02%-0.04%; n=2) (Figure 5).

CD3 was highly expressed on all ATA 129 vials (96.4%±4.8%; n=6). Moreover, flow cytometric 
examination of CD20 receptor expression revealed that the CD3+ cell population did not express 
significant levels of this marker (0.03%±0.03%; n=6).

rectangle depicts CD20 expression on CD3+ cells)  
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Conventional studies on pharmacokinetics, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination are 
not applicable for tabelecleucel as described in the CHMP’s 2006 Guideline on human cell based 
medicinal products (EMEA/CHMP/410869/2006). In order to address the persistence and/or the fate of 
the infused cells the applicant referred to published literature ([Doubrovin 2007] and [Koehne 2003]), 
describing in detail the in vivo imaging experiments conducted in tumour-bearing mice with 
radiolabelled tabelecleucel. It was shown that tabelecleucel was able to migrate to and infiltrate sc 
BLCL tumours within 1 day. Further infiltration was observed on days 8 and 28 [Doubrovin 2007]. 
Migration and infiltration occurred into fully HLA-matched tumours and was absent from mismatched 
tumours. Similarly, infiltration/absence of infiltration occurred in EBV+/EBV- BLCL [Koehne 2007].

2.5.4.  Toxicology 
2.5.4.1.  Single and repeat dose toxicity 
Single and repeat dose toxicity studies were not conducted as due to the species-specific nature of 
tabelecleucel these studies would yield no additional information to aid in the understanding of its 
potential toxicity in humans. 
2.5.4.2.  Genotoxicity 
As tabelecleucel is a non-genetically engineered cell product, it is not expected to interact directly with 
DNA or other chromosomal material. In accordance with ICH S6(R1), genotoxicity studies with 
tabelecleucel were not conducted.   
2.5.4.3.  Carcinogenicity 
Tabelecleucel has not demonstrated, and is not anticipated to have, carcinogenic potential and as 
stated in ICH S6(R1), standard carcinogenicity bioassays are generally inappropriate for biotechnology-
derived pharmaceuticals.  
The applicant conducted study RPT-129-1002 to investigate potential EBV transmission and 
tumorigenic effect. This study utilised a co-culture assay using and EBV-specific cytotoxic T 
lymphocytes lines (EBV-CTL) or EBV BLCL with cord blood mononuclear cells (MCBC). B-cell 
transformation and the presence of EBV did not occur in any instance when EBV BLCL or EBV CTL were 
cocultured with the cord blood samples. 
A similar coculture assay was conducted with T cell depleted normal PBMC, used as targets for 
infection. Data showed that, in no instance, B cell transformation or the presence of EBV was detected 
in the T cell depleted PBMC cultured with the EBV-specific CTLs. However, B cell transformation and 
the presence of EBV was detected in 3/10 samples in which autologous irradiated EBV BLCL. Such 
growth was only detected when the EBV BLCL were cultured in the absence of either acyclovir or 
ganciclovir. 
Comparative analyses of BLCL and EBY-specific CTL derived from 5 individuals cocultured both with the 
T cell depleted mononuclear cells and with the cord blood cells was also conducted. Again, in no 
instance was EBV detected in the cord blood samples. EBV was detected in one of the 5 samples of T 
cell depleted PBMC cocultured with autologous BLCL in the absence of acyclovir or ganciclovir. 
These results suggest that coculture of EBV BLCL and EBV-specific CTLs with T cell depleted PBMC in 
the presence of cyclosporin may be more sensitive for detecting EBV. Again, in no instance, however, 
was transmissible EBV detected in the CTLs in the presence or absence of acyclovir or ganciclovir. The 
comparative studies suggest that co-culture of cell products with T cell depleted PBMC in the presence 
of cyclosporin may, in fact, be more sensitive than coculture with cord blood samples. 
Taken together, this data showed the lack of transmission and uncontrolled proliferation of infectious 
EBV to MCBC and autologous T cell depleted PBMC. 
2.5.4.4.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Due to the highly species-specific nature of the pharmacology associated with tabelecleucel, nonclinical 
reproductive/developmental toxicity studies were not submitted with this application. 
Assessment report  
EMA/858618/2022  
Page 29/87 
 
 
 
2.5.4.5.  Local tolerance 
As tabelecleucel is administered intravenously, no local tolerance studies were submitted. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Tabelecleucel is a cell based therapeutic product that is not genetically modified. In accordance with 
the EMA guidance ‘Guideline on environmental risk assessments for medicinal products consisting of, 
or containing, genetically modified organisms (GMOs)’, EMEA/CHMP/BWP/473191/2006 – Corr., 
tabelecleucel is not expected to pose a risk to the environment and therefore an environmental risk 
assessment was not performed.  
2.5.6.  Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
Ebvallo consists of a mixture of EBV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells generated by ex vivo stimulation with 
EBV-infected BLCLs. Ebvallo’s mechanism of action is cytotoxicity toward malignant EBV-infected B 
cells in PTLD patients. Three independent in vitro primary PD studies with identical designs confirmed 
that Ebvallo is cytotoxic toward autologous BLCLs. Besides CD8+ T cells the CD4+ T cells also 
displayed cytotoxic potential. Study PHRM-RPT-129-1005 demonstrated identical cytotoxicity of both 
CD4 and CD8, while slightly higher and considerably higher CD8 cytotoxicity was shown in studies 
PHRM-RPT-129-1006 and RPT-129-1004, respectively. In conclusion, the in vitro studies confirmed 
that besides CD8+ T cells also the CD4 T cells contribute to the mode of action of Ebvallo.  
The in vivo experiments demonstrated a pronounced therapeutic effect/increased survival of SCID 
mice suffering from intraperitoneal EBV-induced lymphoblastic B cell lymphomas (EBV-BLCL) that were 
treated with autologous (with respect to EBV-BLCL) tabelecleucel. This effect was also seen in sc or ip 
tumours treated with tabelecleucel. Therapeutic effect was observed in the presence or in the absence 
of IL-2. In a further experiment the migration to and infiltration of tumours was shown in SCID mice. 
Most of the tumour-infiltrating T cells were CD8+, less were CD4+. Stronger infiltration was found in 
the autologous tabelecleucel/EBV-BLCL setting, less in the HLA-matched situation. Altogether, the 
experiments demonstrate in vivo-proof of-principle. 
The only measurable effect of Ebvallo relies on its mechanism of action, i.e. lysis of EBV-infected B 
cells. Secondary PD studies are therefore not considered necessary. 
Flow cytometric examination of CD20 receptor expression revealed that the CD3+ T cell population did 
not express significant levels of this marker. These data demonstrate that tabelecleucel does not 
express CD20 and is not considered to be of high risk for CD20 targeting by Rituximab therapy in 
patients with EBV+PTLD. Pharmacodynamic drug interactions relying on residual Rituximab are thus 
unlikely. 
The applicant conducted experiments to evaluate the risk of B cell infection either by CTLs or the EBV-
infected BLCL stimulator cells. B cells present in allogeneic mononuclear cord blood cells or in 
autologous T cell depleted PBMC were used as targets for infection. In two cases PBMC could be 
productively infected with BLCLs. This could be prohibited in the presence of acyclovir that is used in 
routine manufacture of BLCLs. There were no instances in which CTLs could infect B cells present in 
cord blood or PBMC. These results provide reassurance regarding the potential of tabelecleucel for EBV 
transmission and infection.  
Due to the nature of the product, in vitro assays and studies in ex vivo models or in vivo models 
cannot accurately assess and predict the toxicological characteristics of this product in humans. Hence, 
Assessment report  
EMA/858618/2022  
Page 30/87 
 
 
 
conventional toxicology, carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, mutagenicity and reproductive toxicology studies 
have not been performed with tabelecleucel.  
Studies conducted in immunodeficient animal models for EBV+ PTLD revealed no overt signs of toxicity 
(e.g. loss of activity or weight loss) associated with a single dose of tabelecleucel. 
No ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment was conducted. The active substance consists of non-
genetically modified T cells and thus is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
The CHMP endorse the CAT discussion on the non-clinical aspects as described above. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From a non-clinical point of view Ebvallo (tabelecleucel) has been adequately characterised and is 
recommended for marketing authorisation. 
The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusions on the non-clinical aspects as described above. 
2.6.  Clinical aspects 
2.6.1.  Introduction 
GCP aspects 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.  
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the Community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
As this is a cell-based medicinal product, no PK analyses were performed by the applicant. No clinical 
PK (or PD) studies were performed. Residual amounts of rituximab might interfere with tabelecleucel 
treatment by binding to CD20. However, as described in the non-clinical section of this report, CD20 is 
not expressed on tabelecleucel, and PK or PD interactions are therefore unlikely. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Tabelecleucel consists of T cells that specifically target and eliminate cells expressing EBV antigens. 
Tabelecleucel is claimed as being capable to lyse cells presenting EBV antigens in complex with a 
human leukocyte antigen (HLA) to which the EBV-CTLs are restricted. This includes EBV-transformed B

lymphocytes responsible for EBV+ PTLD. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Studies 11-130 and 95-024 
Studies 11-130 and 95-024 were combined and analysed as a single study due to their small sample 
size and similarity in design (open-label single-arm, single-centre studies). The objective of both 
studies was to explore the relationship of EBV Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Precursor (CTLp) with the 
efficacy and safety endpoints investigated (These studies are further detailed in the Clinical Efficacy 
section of this report). 
According to the investigation plan of study 11-130 the EBV CTLp data per patient were collected at 
baseline (pre infusion) and up to 13 days post infusion. In study 95-024 the EBV-specific CTLp were 
measured immediately before, 1, and 7 days following the first and third infusion of cells in each cycle, 
at days 14 and 21 following the last infusion of each cycle and at 1, and 4 months following completion 
of additional cycle of cells. The criteria for including patients in the CTLp analysis were application of 
“at least 1 representative dose of the tabelecleucel cell therapy product”. 
Disease response (Table 1) and overall survival (OS,Figure 7) parameters were examined by peak 
EBV-CTLp subgroups (≤Q1 as low or > Q1 high).

Study ATA129-EBV-302: 
Biomarkers  EBV-CTLp,  cytokines  (IL-1β,  IL-2,  IL-6,  TNF-α),  plasma  EBV  DNA,  and  anti-HLA  antibody 
were assessed to explore a possible relationship to efficacy and safety endpoints. 
Patients in this study received an intravenous infusion of a fixed dose of 2 × 106 cells/kg on days 1, 8, 
and 15 of each 35-day cycle. Therefore, it is not possible to assess a possible dose response 
relationship. 
39 EBV+ PTLD patients were included in Study ATA129-EBV-302 (25 C-SOT; 12 C-SOT-R; 13 C-SOT-
R+C; 14 C-HCT). The criteria for including patients in the CTLp analysis were application of “at least 1 
dose of the tabelecleucel cell therapy product” and “evaluable baseline and at least 1 post-baseline 
measurement” was fulfilled by only 26 patients in the study ATA129-EBV-302. 
EBV-CTLp: 
Responders showed a higher “Peak Fold Change” for EBV CTLp from baseline (data not shown).  
The applicant also provided data from a publication [Prockop 2020]. IFN- γ+ EBV-specific T cells of 
third-party donor origin were detectable by differences to the host by short tandem repeats (STR). 
Third-party EBV-CTLs were detectable in patients in the range of 16 days to 32 days and in one 
patient up to 23.7 months after infusion. The cited literature proposed an activation of endogenous 
Assessment report  
EMA/858618/2022  
Page 34/87 
 
 
 
 
 
T cell responses potentially stimulated by cross-presentation of antigens from EBV-associated 
lymphomas targeted by the third-party EBV-CTLs.  
The persistence of infusion product was assessed for five patients using a genetic assay that uses 
single tandem repeats (STR) from 8 loci to differentiate between the patient PBMCs and infusion 
product. This detection method does not have broad utility because it can only work when there is 
enough mismatch at the STR loci to be able to differentiate donor cells from patient cells. This was 
performed on IFN-gamma+ cells post peptide stimulation and limited to the material available. 
Third-party EBV-CTLs were detected 32 days after initial infusion and 16 days after third infusion in 
cycle 1, and in one solid organ transplant recipient, at 23.7 months after infusion. 
Cytokines: 
Plasma was collected prior to infusion of tabelecleucel, then again at safety follow-up. Therefore, long 
time effects of Ebvallo are recorded. Acute post infusion reactions were not found.  
In general, the four evaluated cytokines (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-α) showed no change to baseline 
in studies EBV-CTL-201 and ATA129-EBV-302. One patient had elevated IL-6 in study ATA129-EBV-
302 that could be related to Ebvallo treatment, but several other factors unrelated to the treatment 
could also have contributed to the increase in IL-6. 
Serum Epstein-Barr Virus DNA: 
The PCR-based measurement of the virus load is suitable for monitoring disease progression. The 
baseline EBV copies/mL ranged from 195 (LLOD) to 1920000 (ULOD). During treatment, the value 
raised and fell for the patients.  
In order to better assess whether the treatment has an influence on the individual virus load, “post-
baseline fold change” was plotted. When “Lowest Post-baseline” and “Lowest Fold Change” of Epstein-
Barr virus DNA in serum was plotted against responders and non-responders a statistically significant 
correlation with clinical response was observed. Responders showed lower post-baseline levels of 
serum Epstein-Barr Virus DNA (data not shown).  
Anti-HLA Antibodies: 
The anti-HLA antibody dataset was limited to subjects who were tested negative for anti-HLA 
antibodies prior to the first infusion of tabelecleucel. As all patients came into contact with foreign HLA 
due to organ transplantation or stem cell transplantation only 7 subjects were tested. 
Of the 7 subjects, a single subject in C-SOT subsequently developed a positive anti-HLA antibody 
result.  
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Biomarker studies were conducted aiming to enumerate the EBV CTLp associated with Ebvallo 
treatment. However, as the EBV CTLp assay cannot distinguish between endogenous EBV-reactive 
CTLp and those infused by Ebvallo it cannot provide an accurate estimation for the latter. 
A joint analysis of studies 11-130 and 95-024 showed that responders had higher CTLp peaks than 
non-responders.  Similarly, study ATA129-EBV-302 demonstrated a correlation of post-infusion levels 
of EBV-CTLp with clinical efficacy. Consequently, it is agreed that the EBV-CTLp biomarker may be 
used to predict the outcome of a patient. However, it cannot be determined whether the biomarker 
changes seen were in response to treatment or a result of endogenous T cells. Median fold EBV CTLp 
change from baseline were sometimes below one. This suggests that the EBV CTLp cell number is 
lower than before the treatment. In addition, not all patients included in these analyses were assessed 
Assessment report  
EMA/858618/2022  
Page 35/87 
 
 
 
at every time point. Data from [Prockop 2020] suggest that in some cases when there is sufficient 
differentiation in the STR loci between donor and patient cells it is possible to distinguish between the 
two. However, as such an analysis was limited to only 5 patients, the overall value of the biomarker 
studies submitted is considered limited.  
A statistically significant correlation between EBV DNA levels with clinical response was observed. 
Responders showed lower post-baseline levels of serum Epstein-Barr Virus DNA. However, as with EBV 
CTLp, it is not clear whether an endogenous anti EBV immune response is responsible for this effect. 
The anti-HLA antibody dataset was limited to only 7 subjects from whom only one developed a positive 
anti-HLA antibody result. Valid conclusions related to anti-drug antibody (ADA) induction are therefore 
not possible.  
The applicant did not submit secondary PD studies which is considered acceptable due to the nature of 
the product.  Certain concomitant or recently administered medicinal products including chemotherapy 
(systemic or intrathecal), anti-T-cell antibody-based therapies, extracorporeal photopheresis or 
brentuximab vedotin could potentially impact the efficacy of Ebvallo. Ebvallo should therefore only be 
administered after an adequate washout period of such agents. 
As tabelecleucel has not been evaluated in patients receiving corticosteroid doses greater than 1 
mg/kg per day of prednisone or equivalent, it is recommended not to exceed such doses in patients 
receiving Ebvallo treatment.  
Finally, as in vitro characterisation data demonstrated the absence of CD20 expression on 
tabelecleucel, it is not expected that anti-CD20 antibody treatments will affect tabelecleucel activity. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Limited clinical pharmacology data are available which is to be expected as the nature of the product 
poses significant challenges to fully characterise its pharmacological properties. Necessary warnings to 
minimise any potential risks from the administration of tabelecleucel with commonly used concomitant 
medication in this clinical setting are included in the SmPC. There are no clinical pharmacology 
objections for the approval of Ebvallo.  
The CHMP endorse the CAT assessment regarding the conclusions on the Clinical pharmacology as 
described above.

dosing schedule is presented in this section.

The tabelecleucel dose administered in Study ATA129-EBV-302 and the supportive study EBV-CTL-201 
was 2 × 106 viable T cells/kg in treatment cycles of 3 weekly IV infusions (days 1, 8, and 15) followed 
by an observation period of up to 3 weeks.  
In the study 95-024 patients were divided into two groups. The group 1 with subjects with high risk of 
GvHD were treated with 1 x 106 cells/kg tabelecleucel. Two additional dose levels of EBV-CTLs (2 × 106 
and 5 × 106 cells/kg) were planned for subjects in group 2 (low risk of GvHD). As doses of only 
1 × 106 cells/kg could be consistently generated in a timely fashion from the transplant donors, the 
protocol-specified dose escalation was not completed. With the median of the average number of cells

received per dose of tabelecleucel was 1.06 × 106 cells/kg and a median of 7.0 doses of tabelecleucel 
an ORR of the 15 subjects with EBV+ PTLD was 63.6%. Of note, majority of subjects in this study were 
paediatric patients. The median (min, max) age was 11.5 years (5, 70); 8 subjects were < 16 years 
and 10 subjects were < 18 years.  
In study 11-130 subjects in group 1 were to receive a cycle of 3 weekly IV infusions of tabelecleucel at 
a dose of 2 × 106 cells/kg of recipient body weight. After the third dose, subjects were observed for 
approximately 3 weeks. Clinical benefit was demonstrated in the group of 35 patient with EBV+PTLD. 
In the C-HCT, 17 of the 25 subjects had a best overall response of either CR (13 subjects) or PR (4 
subjects), giving an ORR of 68.0%. In the C-SOT, 5 of the 10 subjects had a best response of either 
CR (2 subjects) or PR (3 subjects), giving an ORR of 50.0%. Regarding demographics, subjects in the 
C-PTLD had median age of 28.3 years in the C-HCT cohort and 22.0 years in the SOT PTLD cohort. 
Nine patients of the whole C-PTLD cohort were <18 years. 
Importantly, the dose selection was made taking to the account the threshold of 105 alloreactive 
cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursor/kg (potentially coadministered), since the risk of GvHD below this 
threshold is low [Kernan 1986]. 
Rationale for Dosing on Days 1, 8, and 15 
The approach of dosing on Days 1, 8, and 15 allows for clinical evaluation and ruling out of 
hyperacute alloreactive manifestations prior to subsequent dosing and has previously been shown 
to be safe, without acute toxicities or instances of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) [O'Reilly 
2015]. Weekly dosing over 3 weeks allows for minimisation of alloreactivity events based on the 
presence of low levels of cytotoxic T lymphocytes precursors that have potential to induce GvHD 
observed at higher doses [Doubrovina 2012]. 
Rationale for a 35-Day Cycle 
The dosing schedule of 35 days used in pivotal study ATA129-EBV-302 was informed by early clinical 
experience, including Studies 95-024 and 11-130 and takes into account optimal timing for response 
assessments as well as logistics related to selection of an appropriate tabelecleucel lot and shipping 
to site. For efficacy, median time to response was 1.1 month. Safety events of concern (such as 
GvHD, for which the concern was initially based on extrapolation from experience with donor 
lymphocyte infusion) are more likely to occur prior to Day 30 [Frey 2008]. The 35-day cycle consists 
of a weekly dosing regimen over the first 3 weeks (Days 1, 8, and 15, as described above). The 
remainder of time in the 35-day cycle allows for time to determine a response, to select the 
appropriate lot for the next dose based on response, and for the site to procure the first dose for the 
next cycle. 
Rationale for switching to other HLA product 
If a subject does not respond, an HLA restriction switch (switch to tabelecleucel with a different HLA 
restriction) is recommended. Selection of an alternative tabelecleucel product using a different HLA 
restriction enables killing of the malignant cell via a different EBV target peptide-HLA complex. Durable 
responses were observed in the Phase 1/2 trials with switch therapy. 
Based on results from Studies 95-024 and 11-130, up to 4 HLA restrictions were originally proposed 
for subjects with relapsed and/or refractory Epstein-Barr virus positive posttransplant 
lymphoproliferative disease (R/R EBV+ PTLD) in the pivotal study ATA129-EBV-302. The protocol was 
amended to limit the number of HLA restrictions to 2 for the SOT cohort, considering that subjects with 
EBV+ PTLD following SOT-R may yet benefit from salvage chemotherapy and based on a 
recommendation from the FDA. To remain consistent between HCT and SOT cohorts, objective 
response rate is based on response assessments performed at up to 2 restrictions for all cohorts in this 
global study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/858618/2022  
Page 37/87 
 
 
 
Regarding responses assessed after 2 restrictions, for those subjects who responded to treatment, one 
subject who received 4 different HLA restrictions had a response in Study 11-130 after the 4th 
restriction; to date, 2 subjects received 3 different HLA restrictions in Study ATA129-EBV-302, of which 
1 subject achieved clinical benefit (defined as complete response, partial response, or stable disease) 
after the 3rd restriction. For both C-SOT-R+C and C-HCT, the target indications, salvage chemotherapy 
is less likely to be a feasible option, and there is potential for clinical benefit with a restriction switch of 
tabelecleucel if needed. Therefore, up to 4 restrictions are allowed in both indications. 
2.6.5.2.  Main study 
ATA129-EBV-302: Multicenter, Open-Label, Phase 3 Study of Tabelecleucel for Solid Organ or 
Allogeneic Haematopoietic Cell Transplant Subjects with Epstein-Barr Virus-Associated Post-Transplant 
Lymphoproliferative Disease after Failure of Rituximab or Rituximab and Chemotherapy (ALLELE 
Study).  
Methods 
The phase 3 tabelecleucel clinical development programme, initiated in 2018, initially comprised 2 
studies, ATA129-EBV-301 in subjects with EBV+ PTLD following allogeneic HCT and ATA129-EBV-302 
in subjects with EBV+ PTLD following SOT. These 2 studies were merged under ATA129-EBV-302 
(Protocol Amendment 3, 31 May 2019) due to the ultra-low incidence of relapsed/refractory EBV+ 
PTLD and to mitigate against the risk of sites terminating participation in the studies due to slow 
enrolment.

Treatments 
Subjects were administered tabelecleucel via slow IV push over 5 to 10 minutes at doses of 2 × 106 
cells/kg of actual body weight at screening by the investigator or designated trained personnel. There

was no dose adjustment for obesity or for weight changes after baseline. Each cycle lasted 5 weeks 
(35 days) and consisted of 3 doses of tabelecleucel, which were administered on day 1 (up to + 4 days 
relative to day 1 of the prior cycle), day 8 (± 2 days relative to day 1 of the current cycle), and day 15 
(± 2 days relative to day 1 of the current cycle), followed by an observation period. Treatment with 
tabelecleucel continued until maximal response, unacceptable toxicity, initiation of non-protocol 
therapy, or failure of up to 2 tabelecleucel with different HLA restrictions (SOT subjects) or up to 4 
tabelecleucel with different HLA restrictions (HCT subjects), if available.  
Maximal response was reached when the subject received 3 consecutive PR assessments, or 2 
consecutive CR assessments as assessed by the investigator using Lugano classification response 
criteria with LYRIC modification. In instances where the subject's PTLD rapidly progressed during the 
first cycle, the subject had documented radiographic or clinical progressive disease (PD) any time after 
the third tabelecleucel dose (cycle 1 day 15), and the medical monitor had been consulted and 
approved, restriction switch (i.e., treatment with tabelecleucel with a different HLA restriction) could be 
initiated before the 35 days of cycle 1 was complete. The first dose of tabelecleucel after the restriction 
switch would constitute cycle 2 day 1. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the main study was to determine the clinical benefit of tabelecleucel  
- in subjects with EBV+ PTLD following SOT after failure of rituximab (subgroup A) or  
- in subjects with EBV+ PTLD following SOT after failure rituximab + chemotherapy (subgroup B) 
or 
-  in subjects with EBV+ PTLD following allogeneic HCT after failure of rituximab, as measured by 
the objective response rate (ORR).  
The secondary objectives of this study were as follows: 
• To evaluate duration of response (DOR) in the SOT and HCT cohorts separately 
• To evaluate ORR and DOR in the SOT and HCT cohorts combined 
• To evaluate rates of CR and PR 
• To evaluate time to response (TTR) and time to best response (TBR) 
• To evaluate OS 
• To evaluate graft status (SOT subjects only) 
• To characterise the safety profile of tabelecleucel in this subject population 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is ORR (CR or PR) determined separately in each cohort 
(SOT and HCT) following administration of tabelecleucel with up to 2 different HLA restrictions. The 
primary efficacy analyses of disease assessment-related endpoints were based on the disease 
assessments by IORA (independent oncologic response adjudication).  
Secondary efficacy endpoints were: 
DOR in SOT and HCT cohorts separately 
ORR and DOR in SOT and HCT cohorts combined 
Rate of CR and PR 
Assessment report  
EMA/858618/2022  
Page 40/87 
 
 
 
TTR and TTBR 
OS 
The safety endpoint was as follows: 
• Rates of allograft loss/rejection episodes (for SOT cohort only): loss is defined as allograft removal, 
resumption of renal replacement therapy (kidney), initiation of a ventricular assist device (heart), need 
for mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (lung), re-transplant (any), or 
placement on a SOT list (any); rejection episodes were defined according to appropriate criteria for the 
particular organ transplant. 
Sample size 
For each cohort, the estimated ORR for treatment with tabelecleucel was ≥ 48%, and the null ORR was 
assumed to be 20%. Based on a 1-sided exact binomial test at the alpha = 0.025 level of significance, 
a sample size of 29 subjects provided 90% power to detect a true ORR of at least 48%. Four additional 
subjects were to be enrolled, as needed, to achieve 29 evaluable subjects, for a total sample size of up 
to 33 subjects per cohort. For the SOT cohort, the enrolment was to take all comers, i.e., there was no 
limitation on the number of subjects to be enrolled within each of the 2 subgroups. 
Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
This is an open-label, non-randomised, single-arm study. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) was defined as all subjects who have received at least 1 dose of 
tabelecleucel. The Safety Analysis Set was identical to the FAS. All efficacy and safety analyses were 
planned to be based on the FAS unless otherwise specified. 
The All-Enrolled Analysis Set was defined as subjects whose study eligibility was confirmed and who 
were enrolled into the study. The All-Enrolled Analysis Set was planned to be used for sensitivity 
analysis of ORR, if different from the FAS. 
The Evaluable Analysis Set (EAS) was defined post-hoc and comprises all subjects who received at 
least 1 dose of tabelecleucel and had at least 1 evaluable postbaseline disease assessment per IORA, 
or discontinued study or received non-protocol anti-PTLD therapy. 
Cohorts 
This study had 2 cohorts: the C-SOT and C-HCT. The C-SOT included SOT subjects who had failed 
rituximab alone (subgroup A) or rituximab and chemotherapy (subgroup B) for the treatment of PTLD. 
The C-HCT included HCT subjects who had failed rituximab for the treatment of PTLD. 
The primary analysis and hypothesis testing were planned to be conducted for the C-SOT and C-HCT, 
respectively. 
In addition, analyses based on the SOT and HCT cohorts combined were planned to be performed and 
considered as secondary and for SOT subgroups A and B separately as exploratory analyses. 
Hypothesis and/or Estimation 
Objective response rate based on IORA-adjudicated disease assessment in the FAS was planned as the 
primary analysis for ORR. 
Assessment report  
EMA/858618/2022  
Page 41/87 
 
 
 
If a new PTLD treatment, other than specified in the protocol, was initiated, response data after the 
initiation date was planned to be censored for the purpose of the efficacy analysis. 
Interim analyses 
In total, 3 efficacy analyses were planned for the SOT cohort, with 2 interim analyses (at N = 15 and 
21 subjects) and 1 final analysis. At the first interim analysis (N = 15), a futility analysis was also 
planned to be performed. An O’Brien Fleming spending function was planned to be used for the interim 
analyses with 1-sided alpha being 0.0009, 0.0047 and 0.0234 at the 2 interim analyses and the final 
analysis, respectively. If the timing of the interim analysis deviates from the schedule, the alpha level 
was planned to be kept the same as pre-specified. For the futility analysis at N = 15 subjects, the 
conditional power approach was planned to be used. 
More specifically, if the conditional power under the average of observed data and alternative 
hypothesis is less than 10%, the futility boundary was planned to be met. At the interim analyses, it 
was planned that the totality of data may also be considered in addition to the statistical boundary for 
formal decision-making. 
While no formal interim analysis was planned for the HCT cohort, at the time of an interim analysis for 
the SOT cohort, the data for the HCT cohort was also planned to be analysed.

Study initiated: 26 June 2018 (date of main informed consent) 
Data cut-off date 05 November 2021 (study is ongoing) 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol was dated 31 July 2016 and was amended 4 times.  
In protocol amendment 3, EBV+ PTLD following allogeneic HCT after failure of rituximab from Study 
ATA129-EBV-301 were added as an additional cohort (HCT cohort) in this study, to adapt to slower-
than-expected enrolment due to the ultra-low incidence of relapsed/refractory EBV+ PTLD and to 
mitigate against the risk of sites terminating participation in the studies due to slow enrolment.  
In the FU Protocol Assistance (EMEA/H/SA/3977/1/FU/1/2018/PA/SME/ADT/PR/III) CHMP agreed with 
a merge of studies ATA129-EBV-301 and ATA129-EBV-302 in case the benefit / risk assessment and 
the efficacy and safety analyses of the two studies / cohorts were to be evaluated independently. 
Protocol violations were sporadic and were not considered to impact on the validity of the efficacy 
results.

A total of 43 subjects have been enrolled in Study ATA129-EBV-302 (14 subjects C-HCT, 29 subjects 
C-SOT [13 C-SOT-R, 16 C-SOT-R+C]), of those, 4 subjects (1 subject C-SOT-R and 3 subjects C-SOT-
R+C) were enrolled after the cut-off date used in the initial MAA submission (07 May 2021). 
The number of subjects in the All-Enrolled Analysis Set (N = 43) was the same as in the FAS, therefore 
sensitivity analysis for ORR was not conducted using the All Enrolled Analysis Set.

Durable response rate 
Analyses of subjects who achieved complete response (CR) and durable CR were conducted on the 
full analysis set (FAS) in Study ATA129-EBV-302 using data from the 05 November 2021 data cut-
off, per IORA assessment.  
In the C-PTLD, 12 of 43 subjects (27.9%) in the FAS had achieved CR per IORA assessment, 
among whom 9 (75.0%) had durable CR (with a duration of > 6 months). Four of the 9 
subjects (44.4%) had subsequent progression of disease. Subjects who achieved CR are discussed 
further below. 
The Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimate of median (95% CI) duration of CR was 23.0 months 
(6.8, not estimable [NE]), with a median (min, max) follow-up time in response of 14.5 
months (0.03, 23.3). 
•  In the C-HCT, the KM estimate of median (95% CI) duration of CR was 23.0 months 
(15.9, NE) with a median (min, max) follow-up time in response of 18.8 months (0.03, 
23.3). 
•  In the C-SOT-R+C, the KM estimate of median (95% CI) duration of CR was 14.1 
months (6.8, NE) with a median (min, max) follow-up time in response of 7.1 months 
(1.6, 14.9). 
•  In the C-SOT-R, the single subject who achieved CR was censored at data cut-
off after a follow-up time of 19.8 months. 
Four subjects in the C-HCT, 4 subjects in the C-SOT-R+C, and 1 subject in the C-SOT-R had durable 
CR. Three subjects had non-durable CR (all subjects censored at the time of data cut-off, with 2 
subjects in the C-HCT and 1 subject in the C-SOT-R+C: 
•  One subject first achieved CR at the end of cycle 5 per IORA, however treatment was 
discontinued due to investigator assessment of PD at the same time. The subject later 
ended the study with overall survival of 13.1 months (censored). 
•  One subject achieved 4 consecutive PRs starting at cycle 1 followed by  2 consecutive CRs 
per IORA. The subject ended treatment per dosing algorithm, remains on study, and has 
been in follow-up for 14.2 months at data cut-off 
•  One subject received 2 cycles of tabelecleucel, achieved CR at the end of cycle 1 and cycle 
2 per IORA, and ended treatment per the dosing algorithm. The subject remains on study 
and has been in follow-up for 2.6 months at data cut-off.

Ancillary analyses 
Observational real-world data were collected (Study RS002) to create a control arm for the single arm 
study 302. The data were collected retrospectively in the time span of over 20 years. The objective of 
this analysis was to compare OS in patients treated with tabelecleucel in the study 302 (27 subjects, 
14 HCT and 13 SOT setting, data cut-off 07 May 2021) with the control arm of subjects who received 
standard of care next line treatment for EBV+ PTLD (36 HCT and 48 SOT setting). A comparison of the 
demographics, baseline characteristics, disease risk factors and time related variables are summarised

(unadjusted)  
The point estimate remained positive  when weighting  approaches were  used to  account for  observed 
differences in patient characteristics, adjusted hazard ratio of 0.40.  
For the HCT setting, the median OS was not estimable vs. 2.0 months (treatment vs. control); and for 
the SOT setting, the median OS was 16.4 vs. 9.7 months (treatment vs. control).  
In order to have a contemporary sample, the applicant performed an analysis of subjects diagnosed 
with PTLD between 2010 and 2018.  
The 30 patients from Study ATA129-EBV-302 (data cut-off: 05 November 2021) included 14 patients 
post HCT (46.7%) and 16 patients (53.3%) post-SOT-R+C. The 55 patients from Study ATA129-RS002 
include 27 (49.1%) with EBV+ PTLD following HCT and R/R to rituximab and 28 (50.9%) with EBV+ 
PTLD following SOT and R/R to rituximab plus chemotherapy. 
In this analysis of patients treated between 2010 and 2018 in Study ATA129-RS002, tabelecleucel 
demonstrated an OS benefit compared to SOC with an unadjusted HR of 0.46 and an adjusted HR of 
approximately 0.34 for both targeted cohorts.

Supportive studies 
The following supportive studies were performed in the process of development of tabelecleucel: 
Study 95-024, an investigator-initiated proof-of-concept phase 1/2, open-label, single-site study 
conducted at MSKCC to evaluate the toxicities and therapeutic potential of adoptive immunotherapy 
with EBV-CTLs for the treatment of EBV-associated LPDs or other EBV-associated diseases. 
Study 11-130, a non-randomised, single institution (MSKCC), phase 2, single-arm study, designed to 
evaluate the therapeutic activity of tabelecleucel in subjects with an EBV lymphoma, an EBV+ LPD, or 
other EBV-associated disease. 
EBV-CTL-201, a multi-centre, single-arm, open-label expanded access study, a bridge to the pivotal 
phase 3 studies ATA129-EBV-302 and ATA129-EBV-301. 
Patients have also been treated with tabelecleucel in the following expanded access programmes 
(EAP): 
ATA129-EAP-901, an EAP in patients with EBV+ diseases, who are not eligible for treatment in other 
Atara clinical development studies. 
Individual Patient Expanded Access (ATA129-SPU) for individual patients with EBV+ diseases, including 
EBV+ PTLD, who cannot be enrolled in Atara clinical studies or other EAP protocols (no prespecified 
efficacy assessments, only clinical assessment of response) 
Compared to the pivotal study, supportive studies have several important differences regarding patient 
selection, treatment and response assessment: 
Assessment report  
EMA/858618/2022  
Page 57/87 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Subjects in the supportive clinical studies and EAPs were assigned to the groups (C-HCT, C-SOT) 
retrospectively. Critically ill patients and untreated central nervous system disease were allowed in the 
supportive studies and EAPs, but not in Study ATA129-EBV-302. Whereas in the 95-024 study subjects 
received doses of either 1 or 2 × 106 cells/kg (depending on cohort and product availability), the dose 
administered in all other clinical studies and EAPs was 2 × 106 cells/kg. Importantly, for supportive 
studies, IORA data are reported only in integrated analysis, since IORA analyses were performed post 
hoc.  
Main results: 
In study 95-024, 15 patients were treated with tabelecleucel due to EBV+ PTLD (11 following HCT and 
4 following SOT). The majority of patients had high risk disease. For the C-HCT, the ORR was 63.6% 
and the 1-year OS rate was 54.5%. For the C-SOT, the ORR was 50.0%, and the 1-year OS rate was 
75.0%.  
In study 11-130, 35 subjects had EBV+ PTLD (25 following HCT and 10 following SOT for the C-HCT, 
the ORR was 68.0% and the 1-year OS rate was 68.0%. For the C-SOT, the ORR was 50.0% and the 
1-year OS rate was 60.0%. 
Results of both studies demonstrated clinical benefit compared with historical data for rituximab-
refractory EBV+PTLD. 
Patients after HCT reached higher response rates than those in the SOT cohorts. Especially the rate of 
complete remissions was significantly higher in the HCT group in both studies. 
However, there were several limitations in these early phase single-site studies, such as the small 
sample size, inconsistency in dosing, response assessment only by investigator and low frequency and 
inconsistency in duration of follow-up. 
In the multicentre study EBV-CTL-201, 26 subjects had EBV+ PTLD (14 following HCT and 12 following 
SOT); For the C-HCT, the ORR was 50.0% and the 1-year OS rate was 61.5%. For the C-SOT, the ORR 
was 83.3% and the 1-year OS rate was 81.5%. Thus, ORR and OS rate were higher in the C-SOT 
group. Importantly, the results in the C-HCT cohort (e.g. DOR) must be interpreted in context with 
very short follow-up period of 2.8 months of this cohort (vs 22.5 months in the C-SOT group). In 
contrast to the main study, maximum of 4 different tabelecleucel cell product lots were allowed for all 
PTLD patients. 
In the ATA129-EAP-901 a total of 46 patients were enrolled, 18 of which had EBV+ PTLD (10 C-HCT, 8 
C-SOT and received tabelecleucel from only representative lots as of the data cut-off date (02 July 
2021). The ORR was 72.2% for in the C-PTLD (n = 18), 70.0% in the C-HCT (n = 10), 75.0% in the C-
SOT (n = 8).   
In the ATA-129-SPU 48 patients with EBV+ PTLD (19 following HCT and 29 following SOT) were 
enrolled, as of the data cut-off date (02 July 2021). For the C-PTLD, the ORR was 43.8%, for the C-
HCT, the ORR was 26.3% and for the C-SOT, the ORR was 55.2%. 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The phase 3 tabelecleucel clinical development programme initially comprised 2 studies, ATA129-EBV-
301 in subjects with EBV+ PTLD following allogeneic HCT and ATA129-EBV-302 in subjects with EBV+ 
PTLD following SOT. These 2 studies were merged under ATA129-EBV-302 due to the ultra-low 
incidence of relapsed/refractory EBV+ PTLD and to mitigate against the risk of sites terminating 
Assessment report  
EMA/858618/2022  
Page 58/87 
 
 
 
participation in the studies due to slow enrolment. ATA129-EBV-302 is a multi-centre, phase 3, single 
arm, open label study and is the pivotal study in support of this application. 
The single-arm, open label design is considered acceptable, taking into account the claimed indication 
of an ultra-rare condition and the lack of an appropriate comparator. 
The patient population in the pivotal study included patients with relapsed/refractory EBV+ PTLD after 
rituximab for HCT cohort /rituximab with or without chemotherapy for SOT cohort and were treated 
with tabelecleucel monotherapy. To reflect this, the indication for Ebvallo was modified following a 
request from the CHMP, as monotherapy for treatment of adult and paediatric patients 2 years of age 
and older with relapsed or refractory Epstein-Barr virus positive post-transplant lymphoproliferative 
disease (EBV+ PTLD) who have received at least one prior therapy. For solid organ transplant patients, 
prior therapy includes chemotherapy unless chemotherapy is inappropriate. 
Patients with more severe GvHD as well as patients with active CNS lymphoma requiring treatment 
were excluded from the trial and response failure following a minimum cumulative dose for rituximab 
was defined in the inclusion criteria.  
The median age of patients included in the study age was 48.5 years. The majority of subjects 
(86.0%) were adults ≥ 18 years of age; 3 subjects were < 17 years and 6 subjects were < 18 years. 
The small number of paediatric patients is a limitation of the study but more data in this population are 
expected through the pivotal study which is continuing to recruit patients but also the planned post-
authorisation study to describe the safety and effectiveness of tabelecleucel in patients with Epstein-
Barr Virus-Positive Posttransplant Lymphoproliferative Disease in a Real-world setting in Europe which 
will specifically target enrolment of paediatric (aged<18 years) as well as elderly patients (aged≥ 65 
years). 
The primary objective of the study was to determine the clinical benefit of tabelecleucel in subjects 
with EBV+ PTLD following SOT after failure of rituximab or rituximab plus chemotherapy or allogeneic 
HCT after failure of rituximab, as measured by the objective response rate (ORR). The primary efficacy 
endpoint of the study is ORR (CR+PR) determined separately in both cohorts (SOT and HCT). The 
primary efficacy analyses of disease assessment-related endpoints were based on the disease 
assessments by IORA (independent oncologic response adjudication), which is endorsed. Secondary 
endpoints include evaluation of overall survival, duration of response, time to response, ORR 
determined separately in SOT and HCT cohort and evaluation of safety profile of tabelecleucel. Overall, 
the endpoints are considered clinically relevant and appropriate. 
The study aimed to show that ORR is greater than 20% in the SOT cohort at the one-sided significance 
level of 0.025.  The one-sided level of 0.025 is acceptable, however, there was no prospective 
multiplicity control for the HCT cohort, meaning that results in this cohort are descriptive and should be 
interpreted with care. Interim analyses were planned for the SOT cohort. The merit of these analyses 
is not fully clear, given the small sample sizes. The boundaries for significance were not updated with 
the observed information fraction (O’Brien-Fleming type spending function planned). The applicant 
explained that in total there were 4 analyses of the data. The first interim analysis was conducted with 
20 patients in the SOT cohort and was not significant. The second analysis with 24 patients in the SOT 
cohort reached statistical significance at the nominal level of 0.0074. The analysis was then updated 
two times to incorporate ‘overrunning’ data, after statistical significance had been reached at the 
second interim analysis. The timing of neither of the interim analyses is in line with the prespecified 
time points for analysis, as these were planned with n=15, n=21 and n=33 subjects in the SOT cohort. 
These differences in planned and observed sample sizes at the interim analyses are not fully 
understood in light of the small sample size and presumably very close monitoring of the data. 
Potential upward bias associated with the timing of the interim analyses in this open-label, single arm 
study cannot be fully excluded, however, point estimates are rather similar across the 4 analyses.

Considering the therapeutic circumstances, an ad-hoc interpretation of results despite statistical 
uncertainties appears reasonable. 
The recommended dose for tabelecleucel is 2x106 viable cells/kg administered over multiple 35-day 
cycles on days 1, 8, and 15 and response assessment at day 28, followed by observation through 
day 35. The number of treatment cycles with tabelecleucel is determined by the response to 
treatment. If a complete or partial response is not obtained, patients may be switched to an Ebvallo lot 
with a different HLA restriction. This dosing regimen was selected based upon efficacy and safety 
results in the initial supportive studies 95-024 and 11-130. The dose selection was made taking to the 
account the threshold of 105 alloreactive cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursor/kg since the risk of GvHD 
below this threshold is low and the optimal timing for response assessments as well as logistics related 
to selection of an appropriate tabelecleucel lot and shipping to site.  Overall, the recommended dosing 
for tabelecleucel of 2×106 cells/kg is acceptable.  
Three supportive studies and data from two expanded access programs were also submitted. All 
supportive studies have a single arm, open-label design. The applicant also submitted a non-
interventional retrospective review study analysing patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2018 who 
received a next-line of systemic therapy (HCT/post rituximab or SOT/post rituximab-chemotherapy) 
and provided a comparative analysis with the single-arm pivotal study. These data are considered 
supportive, considering well-known limitations of retrospective studies compared to RCT.  
Overall, the clinical development strategy has been discussed via Scientific Advice and complies with 
the provided recommendations. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
ATA129-EBV-302 is an ongoing study, initiated on 26 June 2018. At the cut-off date of the latest 
interim analysis (data cut-off date 05 November 2021) 43 patients had been enrolled. The SOT cohort 
(29 patients) consisted of SOT patients who had failed rituximab monotherapy (13 patients) and SOT 
patients who had failed rituximab plus chemotherapy (SOT-R+C, 16 patients), the latter being the 
pivotal population for the SOT population. All enrolled subjects had received at least one dose of 
tabelecleucel and were included in the full analysis set (FAS).  
In the C-HCT cohort, ORR was 50%; 6 subjects achieved CR and 1 subject achieved PR. In the C-SOT-
R+C, ORR was 56%, 5 achieved CR and 4 PR. In the C-HCT, the KM estimate of median DOR was 23.0 
months (95% CI: 15.9, NE), and the median (min, max) follow-up time was 15.9 months (1.3, 23.3). 
In the C-SOT-R+C, the KM estimate of the median DOR was 15.2 months (95% CI: 0.8, 15.2), and the 
median (min, max) follow-up time was 2.3 months (0.8, 15.2). In the C-HCT, the DRR was 42.9%, in 
the C-SOT-R+C, the DRR was 25.0%.  
In the C-HCT, 4 of 14 subjects (28.6%) died, and the median (min, max) follow-up time was 14.1 
months (2.0, 35.4). The KM estimated 1-year OS rate was 70.1% and the KM estimate of median OS 
was NE.  In the C-SOT-R+C, 7 of 16 subjects (43.8%) died, and the median (min, max) OS follow-up 
time was 5.5 months (0.4, 25.3). The KM estimated 1-year OS rate was 64.3% and the KM estimate of 
median OS was 16.4 months. The KM estimated 1-year OS rate for responders was higher than that 
for non-responders. 
Analyses of subjects who achieved complete response (CR) and durable CR were also conducted on the 
full analysis set (FAS) in Study ATA129-EBV-302 using data from the 05 November 2021 data cut-off, 
per IORA.  
In the C-PTLD, 12 of 43 subjects (27.9%) in the FAS had achieved CR per IORA assessment, 
among whom 9 (75.0%) had durable CR (with a duration of > 6 months) which is considered

clinically meaningful. Four of the 9 subjects (44.4%) had subsequent progression of disease. The 
Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimate of median (95% CI) duration of CR was 23.0 months (6.8, not 
estimable [NE]), with a median (min, max) follow-up time in response of 14.5 months (0.03, 23.3).  
For both C-SOT-R+C and C-HCT, the target indications, salvage chemotherapy is less likely to be a 
feasible option, and there is potential for clinical benefit with a restriction switch of tabelecleucel if 
needed. This is supported by efficacy and safety results for Study ATA129-EBV-302 using the FAS in 
which 17 subjects received a restriction switch, among whom 7 (1 in the C-SOT-R, 3 in the C-SOT-
R+C, and 3 in the C-HCT) achieved clinical benefit (CR, PR or SD). Subjects from all cohorts 
experienced clinical benefit. No relevant safety concerns were observed in the subjects who received a 
restriction switch compared to those who did not. Importantly, no subjects in either group experienced 
the identified or potential risks of tumour flare reaction, infusion-related reactions, cytokine release 
syndrome, bone marrow transplant rejection, or transmission of infectious agents including CMV. 
Overall, the provided data indicate a positive effect for the HLA-restriction switch in all cohorts, even 
considering the relatively small sample size. Up to 4 different human leukocyte antigen (HLA) 
restrictions in the solid organ transplant (SOT) population similar to the haematopoietic cell transplant 
(HCT) population are allowed. 
Special populations 
As of the 5 November 2021, 6 and 20 paediatric subjects were treated in the main and supportive 
studies, respectively. The ORR per IORA was 66% and 40%, respectively. Cumulatively 41 paediatric 
subjects were treated with tabelecleucel across all clinical studies and EAPs. There were no subjects < 
2 years. 8 subjects were ≥2 to < 6, 16 patients were ≥ 6 to < 12 and 17 patients were ≥12 to < 18 
age of years. Although the responses seem to be similar, the small sample sizes (especially in age 
subgroup <6 years), do not allow definite conclusion. Due to the lack of data in patients < 2 years 
tabelecleucel use is limited to paediatric patients 2 years of age and older.  
For subjects ≥ 65 years of age in the C-PTLD, 41.7% (95% CI: 15.2, 72.3) in the main study and 
50.0% (95% CI: 15.7, 84.3) in the supportive studies were responders per IORA. The efficacy analysis 
by the age subgroups was not possible, due to very small sample sizes. In the main study, efficacy of 
tabelecleucel was slightly lower in the population ≥ 65 years compared to < 65 years of age (54% vs 
41%). The interpretation of these results is limited by the sample size, since only 5 elderly patients 
were treated in the main study. The comparison in supportive studies showed favourable results for 
elderly population (40% vs 50%), however, the sample size was also very small with 4 subjects ≥ 65 
years of age.  Additional information for both the elderly and the paediatric populations are expected to 
be collected through the ongoing recruitment of the pivotal study and the planned post-authorisation 
study to describe the safety and effectiveness of tabelecleucel in patients with Epstein-Barr Virus-
Positive Posttransplant Lymphoproliferative Disease in a Real-world setting.  
The safety and efficacy of tabelecleucel have not been studied in patients with severe renal or hepatic 
impairment. However, based on the tabelecleucel mechanism of action, the influence of renal or 
hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tabelecleucel is considered unlikely.  
Supportive studies 
Based on the original application, a total of 106 patients with relapsed/refractory EBV+PTLD received 
at least 1 dose of tabelecleucel within the framework of the four studies and 66 patients were treated 
with tabelecleucel within expanded access programs. Compared to the pivotal study, supportive 
studies have several important differences:  Subjects in the supportive clinical studies and EAPs were 
assigned to the groups (C-HCT, C-SOT) retrospectively. Critically ill patients and untreated central 
nervous system disease were allowed in the supportive studies and EAPs, but not in Study ATA129-
EBV-302. Whereas in the 95-024 study subjects received doses of either 1 or 2 × 106 cells/kg 
Assessment report  
EMA/858618/2022  
Page 61/87 
 
 
 
(depending on cohort and product availability), the dose administered in all other clinical studies and 
EAPs was 2 × 106 cells/kg. Importantly, for supportive studies, IORA analyses were performed post 
hoc. 
The ORR in the main study ATA129-EBV-302 (05 November 2021 data cut-off) is comparable with the 
cumulative ORR of the three supportive studies (50% C-HCT, 56% -SOT-R+C vs. 48%). The ORR 
results for the EAP programs were different, 72.2% in the ATA129-EAP-901 vs. 43.8% in the SPU 
(based on 07 July 2021 data cut-off). The EAP programs have several limitations, e.g. simplified data 
collection, reduced requirements for assessments, which may influence the comparison of these results 
with the efficacy data from clinical trials. However, the efficacy results from all clinical studies and SAP 
are favourable, compared to historical data for patients with r/r EBV+ PTLD. 
The OS data from supportive studies are also consistent with the pivotal study results. The KM 
estimated 6-month and 1-year OS rates were 70.9% and 65.9%. In the cumulative analysis of 
supportive trials, the OS of responders was significantly higher, compared to non-responders. These 
findings are also in line with the results of the pivotal study. 
Using historical controls, the applicant also performed an external comparison to the pivotal study 
(study RS002). Results of this study were updated restricting the external control group to patients 
with an index diagnosis date between 2010-2018. The 30 patients from Study ATA129-EBV-302 
included 14 patients post HCT (46.7%) and 16 patients (53.3%) post-SOT-R+C (based on 05 
November 2021 data cut-off). These were propensity score matched to 55 patients from Study 
ATA129-RS002, including 27 (49.1%) with EBV+ PTLD following HCT and R/R to rituximab and 28 
(50.9%) with EBV+ PTLD following SOT and R/R to rituximab plus chemotherapy. In this analysis 
tabelecleucel continues to demonstrate significant OS benefit compared to SOC with an unadjusted HR 
of 0.46 and an adjusted HR of approximately 0.34 compared to the historical cohort. Despite the 
inherent limitation in such comparisons these results are considered supportive for contextualisation of 
efficacy results from the main study.     
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a MA under exceptional circumstances 
Due to the ultra-rare incidence of EBV+ PTLD, the limited number of patients included in the pivotal 
trial and the under-representation of elderly and paediatric patients in the study is considered 
acceptable. Additional efficacy data, with an emphasis on the elderly and paediatric patients will be 
collected through the planned post-authorisation observational study which will describe the 
effectiveness of tabelecleucel in patients treated for EBV+ PTLD following HCT or SOT in a real-world 
setting. Additional data are also expected through the ongoing pivotal study ATA129-EBV-302 for 
which the final study report is expected in December 2027. Finally, the applicant will submit yearly 
updates on any new information concerning the safety and efficacy of Ebvallo.  
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Tabelecleucel demonstrated clinically significant responses in both post SOT and post HCT EBV+ PTLD 
cohorts.  Approximately  half  of  subjects  in  both  C-HCT  and  C-SOT-R+C  cohorts  achieved  partial  or 
complete  remission.  Durable  responses,  lasting  >  6  months  were  also  observed  in  a  number  of 
responders. The efficacy results from supportive studies are consistent with the pivotal study results.  
Despite the limitations, of the interim analysis and the small sample size, in the therapeutic setting of 
r/r EBV+ PTLD, where there are no therapeutic alternatives and patients have a dismal prognosis, these 
results are considered clinically meaningful. 
The CAT considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a MA under exceptional circumstances: 
Assessment report

• 
Provision of the final results of the ongoing pivotal study ATA129-EBV-302 to provide further 
data on the clinical benefit of tabelecleucel in subjects with EBV+ PTLD following SOT after 
rituximab plus chemotherapy failure or allogeneic HCT after failure of rituximab 
•  A post-authorisation safety study (PASS) to describe the safety and effectiveness of 
tabelecleucel in patients with EBV+ PTLD following HCT or SOT in a real-world setting 
• 
In order to ensure adequate monitoring of safety and efficacy of Ebvallo in the treatment of 
patients with EBV+ PTLD, the MAH shall provide yearly updates on any new information 
concerning the safety and efficacy of Ebvallo. 
The CHMP endorses the CAT conclusion on clinical efficacy as described above. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
The evaluation of safety is based on data for all subjects in the pivotal study (ATA129-EBV-302) and 
an integrated summary of safety (ISS) for subjects with EBV-driven diseases including the supportive 
clinical studies and all subjects in the Expanded Access Programs (EAPs). In the ISS, data were pooled 
across all clinical studies for all disease cohorts (EBV+ PTLD and non-PTLD combined), all EBV+ PTLD 
cohorts, and all non-PTLD disease cohorts.  
While the pivotal study is limited to the proposed indication of EBV+ PTLD, the supportive clinical 
studies and the Expanded Access Programs also contain patients with other EBV driven diseases.  
The ISS included 340 patients, of which 202 were recruited in clinical studies and 138 exposed to 
tabelecleucel through EAPs. This included 52 elderly patients (36 from clinical studies and 16 in EAPs), 
and 86 paediatric and adolescent patients (45 from clinical studies and 41 in EAPs). 
The median dose of tabelecleucel in the ISS was 2.00 × 106 cells/kg (range: 0.8-3.3) The median 
number of cycles was 2.0 (range: 1-14) over a median of 1.7 months (range: 0.03-52.5) of treatment. 
In the C-PTLD population (N = 183) across all clinical studies and EAPs, the median dose of 
tabelecleucel was 2.00 × 106 cells/kg (range: 0.8-2.4). The median number of cycles was 2.0 (range: 
1-9) over a median of 1.8 months (range: 0.03-18.5) of treatment. 
The demographic characteristics were similar across the studies. About half subjects were females 
(46.5%). Most subjects were White/Caucasian (64.1%), not Hispanic/Latino (56.5%) with a mean age 
of 37.8 years (range of 1-84 years, the majority of subjects (80.0%) were ≥ 16 years of age), about 
15% were elderly (≥ 65 years). In general, all age groups were represented across EBV+ PTLD and 
non-PTLD populations except for the children < 2 years of age who were only represented in the non-
PTLD population. 
All data presented in this section, are with the data cut-off of 5th November 2021 unless otherwise 
specified.  
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) include any AE that occurred after first dose of tabelecleucel through 
30 days after the last dose of tabelecleucel or any related AE started on or after the first dose of 
tabelecleucel. TEAEs leading to study treatment discontinuation was collected only in Studies EBV-CTL-
201 and ATA129-EBV-302 and all EAPs. Studies 11-130 and 95-024 collected only SAE, therefore

TESAE Summary outputs include all four Studies, while TEAE Summary outputs report Studies 201 and 
302 only. TEAEs are summarised in Table 16 and TEAEs related to study treatment in Table 17.

Nearly all subjects in Studies ATA129-EBV-302 and EBV-CTL-201 experienced TEAEs: (96.1%). Most 
frequently reported TEAEs by PT were disease progression, pyrexia, and diarrhoea, followed by fatigue, 
cough, nausea, and vomiting. TEAEs had a maximum severity of grade 3 for 37 (35.9%) subjects, 
grade 4 for 17 (16.5%) subjects, and grade 5 for 15 (14.6%) subjects. Treatment-emergent adverse 
event with a maximum severity of grade 4 that occurred in > 1 subject were neutrophil count 
decreased (reported for 5 subjects [4.9%]), white blood cell count decreased and sepsis (reported for 
4 subjects [3.9%] each), lymphocyte count decreased (reported for 2 subjects [1.9%]). Treatment-
emergent adverse events with a maximum severity of grade 5 that occurred in > 1 subject included 
disease progression (8 subjects [7.8%]) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (reported in 2 
subjects [1.9%]). 
Treatment-related TEAEs (based on investigator assessment) for Studies ATA129-EBV-302 and EBV-
CTL-201 were reported for 39.8% of subjects. Treatment-related TEAEs with the highest subject 
number by PT were pyrexia, fatigue, hypotension and nausea followed by neutrophil count decreased 
and diarrhoea. 16.5% of subjects had grade ≥ 3 TEAEs. No fatal treatment-related TEAEs were 
reported. One subject (1.0%) had a treatment-related TEAE that led to study discontinuation. 
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
In study ATA129-EBV-302, treatment-emergent serious adverse events were reported for 60.5% of 
subjects. Reported TESAEs by PT are summarised in Table 18.  
Table 18. Treatment emergent serious adverse event (TESAEs) by preferred term, Study ATA129-
EBV-302 
In the ISS population, 57.9% of subjects were reported as having any TESAEs. The most frequently 
reported SOCs for those patients were Infections and Infestations (27.4%), General disorders and 
administration site conditions (24.1%), Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (13.2%) and 
Gastrointestinal disorders (10.9%). The most frequently reported PTs were disease progression 
(10.9%), pneumonia (10.3%), pyrexia (7.6%), sepsis (4.7%), febrile neutropenia (4.1%), respiratory 
failure (4.1%), death (3.8%), acute kidney injury (2.9%), and device related infection (2.9%).

Related serious adverse events 
ATA129-EBV-302 
A total of 4 subjects (9.3%) had a TESAE that was considered by the investigator as related to 
treatment. The treatment-related TESAE with the highest subject incidence by PT was pyrexia 
(reported for 2 subjects [4.7%]); all other treatment-related TESAEs, such as diarrhoea, hypotension, 
hypoxia, rash, rash erythematous and tachycardia, were reported in only 1 subject for each PT. 
In the ISS, 35 subjects (10.3%) had a TESAE that was considered by the investigator as related to 
treatment. The treatment-related TESAEs with the highest subject incidence by PT were pyrexia, 
reported for 5 subjects [1.5%]); tumour flare in 4 subjects [1.2%] and hypoxia in 3 subjects [0.9%]. 
Febrile nreutropenia, lymphocyte count decreased, neutrophil count decreased, pneumonitis were all 
reported in 2 subjects each [0.6%]; all other treatment-related TESAEs, were reported in only 1 
subject for each PT. 
Deaths 
In the pivotal study ATA129-EBV-302, a total of 18 subjects (41.9%) died; 5 subjects (11.6%) had a 
fatal TESAE, and 13 subjects (30.2%) died due to other causes. By PT, fatal TESAEs included disease 
progression (3 subjects [7.7%]), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (1 subject [2.6%]), and 
respiratory failure (1 subject [2.6%]). None of the fatal TESAEs were considered by the investigator as 
related to treatment. 
Across all 4 clinical studies and Expanded Access Programs, 71 fatal TESAEs were reported (20.0%). 
The most frequent fatal TESAEs were disease progression and death, in all cohorts, followed by 
pneumonia and pneumonia adenoviral. None of the fatal TESAEs were considered related to treatment 
except one subject in the Expanded Access Programme (C-HCT cohort) had 2 grade 5 TESAEs 
(Enterococcal infection and Citrobacter bacteraemia) that were considered possibly related to 
tabelecleucel by the investigator. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 
In the clinical programme, a number of AEs were identified as AESIs of tabelecleucel based on its 
mechanism of action, biological nature, and mode of administration. These were infusion-related 
reaction IRR, transmission of infectious diseases agents including cytomegalovirus CMV), cytokine 
release syndrome CRS, and graft versus host disease GvHD. 
Infusion-related reactions (IRR) 
Due to its biological nature and mode of administration, tabelecleucel has a theoretical risk of infusion-
related reactions (IRR). Infusion-related reactions has been considered as an adverse event of special 
interest for the tabelecleucel clinical development programme. There were 4 subjects who experienced 
events that were considered as IRR by the investigators or treating physician in the clinical studies 
across the clinical development programme (3 in the clinical studies and one in the EAP). The overall 
subject incidence was 1.2% across all 4 clinical studies (N = 202) and 0.7% in EAPs (N = 138).  
Overall, events from 1 subject from clinical study 11-130 and 1 subject from the EAP ATA129-SPU 
were reported as possibly related by the investigator/treating physician. Although, these events were 
reported as possibly related by the investigator, the relationship between tabelecleucel and IRR could 
not be confirmed.  
Transmission of infectious agents, including cytomegalovirus 
The applicant states that no transmissions of infectious agents, including transmission of 
cytomegalovirus, were reported. One subject (with prior HCT) was discontinued from treatment and 
Assessment report  
EMA/858618/2022  
Page 66/87 
 
 
 
subsequently died due to a TESAEs of Enterococcal infection and Citrobacter bacteraemia that were 
considered by the investigator as possibly related to tabelecleucel.  
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) 
Systemic levels of 4 key cytokines (interleukin-1beta [IL 1β], IL 2, IL 6, and TNFα) were evaluated 
from subjects treated with tabelecleucel.  
No event of treatment-emergent CRS was reported in any subjects in the clinical studies. Two grade 1 
events of CRS were reported in 2 of 138 subjects in the EAPs; both subjects had non-PTLD EBV+ 
lymphoma. One case was a nonserious CRS event that occurred after the first dose of tabelecleucel in 
the context of confounding events. The subject developed a concomitant event of encephalopathy that 
was fatal. Neither event was considered treatment related; the encephalopathy was due to progression 
of the patient’s disease. The second case was a serious event of CRS event reported as possibly related 
by the investigator that occurred after multiple doses of tabelecleucel in context of confounding events. 
In both cases, confounding factors were present, and in the second case, the time of occurrence was 
atypical.  
To study the potential risk of CRS in association with tabelecleucel, cytokines commonly associated 
with CRS were analysed in subjects with EBV+ PTLD and other EBV-driven diseases enrolled in clinical 
studies. The applicant states that in pharmacology studies, the evaluation of plasma cytokine levels 
revealed very little modulation from baseline indicating that tabelecleucel as a T cell therapy does not 
depend on systemic cytokine release to evoke clinical benefit and does not promote the risks known to 
occur with increases in cytokines, further supporting the benefit-risk profile of tabelecleucel.  
Neurologic treatment-emergent adverse events  
In addition to CRS, neurologic events were assessed in the context of the possible similarity between 
tabelecleucel and other T-cell therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor T-cell drugs. 
38.8% of subjects in the ISS experienced at least 1 neurologic TEAE, 14.6% experienced neurologic 
TEAEs with a maximum severity of grade ≥ 3, and 1 (1.0%) subject died as a result of a neurologic 
TEAE, which was not considered related to treatment by the investigator. 
Treatment-related neurologic TEAEs were reported for 5.8% of subjects; of these, 1 (1.0%) subject 
had at least 1 treatment-related TEAE with a maximum severity of grade ≥ 3. 
Overall subject incidences of treatment-related neurologic TEAEs by PT category were low, with the 
most common being dizziness and headache (reported in 2 subjects, 1.9% in each PT). 
Graft-versus-host disease 
The subject incidence of GvHD (acute and chronic, serious and nonserious, and treatment-emergent or 
not)was approximately 5% 14 of 340 subjects, 8 of 202 in clinical studies, and 6 of 138 in the EAPs. 
Graft-versus-host disease events were reported as not related to tabelecleucel by the investigator in 
11 of 14 subjects and had a maximum severity grade of 5 in 1 subject. 
The incidence of TEAEs of GvHD in Studies ATA129-EBV-302 and EBV-CTL-201, which collected all 
events (serious and nonserious), was 4.9% (5/103 subjects). Of these, 2 subjects in Study EBV-CTL-
201 reported treatment-emergent GvHD events that were assessed as possibly related to tabelecleucel 
by the investigator. Both subjects had a medical history of allogeneic HCT and were confounded (in 
one case by concomitant use of clindamycin and in the other by recent medical history of GvHD). Two 
(40%) patients had Grade 1, 1 patient (20%) had Grade 2, 1 patient (20%) had Grade 3, and 1 (20%) 
patient had Grade 4 events. No fatal events were reported. Four (80%) patients recovered from GvHD. 
The median time to onset was 42 days (range: 8 to 44 days). The median duration was 35 days 
(range: 7 to 133 days). 
Assessment report  
EMA/858618/2022  
Page 67/87 
 
 
 
Graft-versus-host disease events occurred almost exclusively in subjects with history of 
transplantation: (HCT = 12 and SOT = 1). There was no confirmed case of GvHD in subjects without 
transplant history. The only reported case of GvHD in a subject without transplant history was reported 
as a grade 1 skin GvHD (rash) that occurred in a patient with a complicated history of chronic 
autoimmune skin disease that was ongoing at time of event; the event was assessed as related by the 
investigator, however, no biopsy was performed to confirm the suspected skin GvHD event; the event 
resolved within 4 days and additional doses of tabelecleucel were administered with no subsequent 
aggravation or relapse observed. 
Tumour flare reaction  
Tumour flare reaction (TFR) is considered an identified risk with an established causal relationship to 
tabelecleucel. Overall, 4 of 340 subjects (1.2%) reported at least 1 TFR; all but 1 of the events 
reported in these subjects were serious and all were considered related to treatment.

vascular disorders, if any, were identified by system organ class searching. 
b Accidents and injuries and cerebrovascular disorders were identified by searching with standardised 
MedDRA queries (SMQs) ‘accidents and injuries’ and ‘central nervous system hemorrhages and 
cerebrovascular conditions’, respectively. 
c Anticholinergic syndrome was searched by preferred term. 
d Fractures were searched by preferred terms that included ‘fracture’. Results are the sum of the 
incidence of the following preferred terms: ankle fracture, femur fracture, lower limb fracture, spinal 
compression fracture. 
Blackout was searched by preferred term ‘loss of consciousness’, and postural hypotension was 
searched by preferred term ‘orthostatic hypotension’. Dizziness, ataxia, fall, and syncope were 
searched with corresponding preferred terms. 
Some PTs were reported only in specific age groups: confusional state, hypoxia and sepsis (3 subjects) 
in subjects ≥ 65 years, and device related infection, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and otitis 
media (3 subjects) in the age group < 16 years. 
2.6.8.7.  Immunological events 
Anti-Human Leukocyte Antigen (anti-HLA) Antibodies  
Plasma samples were collected from some subjects enrolled in Study ATA129-EBV-302, and a subset of 
anti-HLA antibody testing was performed following the testing strategy commonly used in conjunction 
with SOT and at various local laboratories which regularly perform such testing. Only 7 subjects were 
evaluable for anti-HLA antibody immunogenicity assessment in Study ATA129-EBV-302 and a single C 
SOT subject was found to be anti-HLA positive post-infusion. 
Marrow or organ rejection 
No events of marrow rejection were reported in the tabelecleucel clinical studies and EAPs. The subject 
incidence of TEAEs of SOT rejection events was 2.0% (1/51 SOT subjects) in the clinical studies and 
7.0% (3/43 SOT subjects) in the EAPs, with an overall incidence of 4.3% (4/94 total SOT subjects). 
The events were reported as not related to tabelecleucel by the investigator except for 1 SPU subject 
who had a grade 1 TESAE. Three of 4 events were serious and there was no event reported with 
severity grade > 2. All 4 events (1 event per subject) had confounding factors, such as history of 
transplant rejection episodes or reduced dosing of immunosuppressive treatments prior to the event. 
The 4 events occurred in lung, liver and heart SOT subjects who are known to have higher baseline 
risk of rejection than in kidney transplant and the incidence rate of 4.3% overall was lower than the 
lowest transplant rejection rate reported in literature which is for kidney transplants patients. Based on 
available data, no relationship between marrow or organ rejection and tabelecleucel has been 
established.  
2.6.8.8.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Based on clinical experience with tabelecleucel, low doses of corticosteroids, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, 
sirolimus, and other immunosuppressive therapies have no impact on the safe use of tabelecleucel. 
However, tabelecleucel has not been evaluated in patients receiving corticosteroid doses greater than 1 
mg/kg per day of prednisone or equivalent.

2.6.8.9.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
TESAEs leading to study treatment discontinuation was collected only in Studies EBV-CTL-201 and 
ATA129-EBV-302 and all EAPs and are summarised in Table 21. 
The most common TESAE leading to treatment discontinuation was disease progression. None of these 
TESAEs were considered related to study treatment. 
While one non-PTLD subject in study EBV-CTL-201 had a treatment-related TESAE of depressed level of 
consciousness that led to treatment discontinuation (the subject subsequently recovered from the 
event), all other reported TESAEs leading to treatment discontinuation, were not considered related to 
treatment.

2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Patient exposure 
The safety profile of tabelecleucel has been established from cumulative data collected over a period of 
more than 20 years involving 340 subjects across several indications in the clinical studies and EAPs.  
The evaluation of safety is based on data for all subjects in the pivotal study (ATA129-EBV-302) and 
an integrated summary of safety (ISS) for subjects with EBV-driven diseases including the supportive 
clinical studies and all subjects in the Expanded Access Programs (EAPs). In the ISS, data were pooled 
across all clinical studies for all disease cohorts (EBV+ PTLD and non-PTLD combined), all EBV+ PTLD 
cohorts, and all non-PTLD disease cohorts.  
Adverse events 
Treatment-emergent AEs are summarised from Studies ATA129-EBV-302 and EBV-CTL-201 only as 
non-serious TEAEs were not collected in Studies 11-130 and 95-024 or the 2 EAPs.  
Assessment report

Nearly all subjects experienced TEAEs: (96.1%). Most frequently reported TEAEs by PT were disease 
progression, pyrexia, and diarrhoea, followed by fatigue, cough, nausea, vomiting, anaemia, decreased 
appetite, hyponatraemia, neutrophil count decreased and white blood cell decreased. TEAEs had a 
maximum severity of grade 3 for 37 (35.9%) subjects, grade 4 for 17 (16.5%) subjects, and grade 5 
for 15 (14.6%) subjects.  
Treatment-related TEAEs (based on investigator assessment) for Studies ATA129-EBV-302 and EBV-
CTL-201 were reported for 39.8% of subjects. Treatment-related TEAEs with the highest subject 
number by PT were pyrexia, fatigue and hypotension, nausea, neutrophil count decreased, and 
diarrhoea. 16.5% of subjects had grade ≥ 3 TEAEs. No fatal Treatment-related TEAEs were reported. 
All of the most frequently reported TEAEs are included in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Serious Adverse Events 
In study ATA129-EBV-302, treatment-emergent serious adverse events were reported for 53.5% of 
subjects. The most frequently reported TESAEs by PT (> 5% of subjects) were disease progression 
(18.6%), sepsis (11.6 %), acute kidney injury, pneumonia, respiratory failure, and vomiting (7.0% in 
each PT); and atrial flutter, dehydration, delirium, fatigue, febrile neutropenia, hypoxia, influenza, 
nausea, and pyrexia (4.7% in each PT). 
A total of 4 subjects (9.3%) had a TESAE that was considered by the investigator as related to 
treatment. The treatment-related TESAE with the highest subject incidence by PT was pyrexia 
(reported for 2 subjects [4.7%]); all other treatment-related TESAEs, such as diarrhoea, hypotension, 
hypoxia, rash, rash erythematous and tachycardia, were reported in only 1 subject for each PT. All of 
these events are included in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Across all EBV-driven diseases evaluated in the 4 clinical studies, 55.0% of subjects had at least 1 
TESAE, 50.0% of subjects had at least 1 TESAE with a maximum severity of grade ≥ 3; 17.8% of 
subjects died due to a TESAE. None of the fatal TESAEs were considered related to treatment. Most 
treatment-related TESAEs were reported by 1 subject in each PT. 
Deaths 
None of the fatal TESAEs were considered related to treatment except one subject in the Expanded 
Access Programme (C-HCT cohort) who had 2 grade 5 TESAEs (Enterococcal infection and Citrobacter 
bacteraemia) that were considered possibly related to tabelecleucel by the investigator. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 
In the clinical programme, a number of AEs were identified as AESIs of tabelecleucel based on its 
mechanism of action, biological nature, and mode of administration. These were infusion-related 
reaction (IRR), transmission of infectious agents including cytomegalovirus (CMV), cytokine release 
syndrome (CRS), and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD).  
For infusion-related reactions, 3 (1.2%) subjects in the clinical studies (N = 202) and 1 (0.7%) subject 
in the EAPs (N = 138) experienced infusion-related reactions, such as pyrexia and non-cardiac chest 
pain, have been reported. Patients should be monitored for at least 1 hour after treatment for signs 
and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. SmPC section 4.8 also includes pyrexia and chest pain 
(including non-cardiac chest pain), which are signs and symptoms of IRR.  
As tabelecleucel is obtained from human donor blood cells, donors are screened and have tested 
negative for relevant communicable disease agents and diseases, including HBV, HCV and HIV. 
Although tabelecleucel lots are tested for sterility, mycoplasma and adventitious agents, a risk of 
transmission of infectious agents exists. One subject (with prior HCT) was discontinued from treatment 
and subsequently died due to a TESAEs of Enterococcal infection and Citrobacter bacteraemia that 
Assessment report  
EMA/858618/2022  
Page 72/87 
 
 
 
were considered by the investigator as possibly related to tabelecleucel. As causality with tabelecleucel 
use cannot be excluded in this case, transmission of infectious agents has been included as an 
important potential risk in the RMP. 
For cytokine release syndrome no event of CRS was reported in any subject in the clinical studies (N = 
202). Two events of grade 1 CRS were reported in the EAPs (N = 138) in two subjects with non-PTLD 
EBV+ lymphoma. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of CRS, such as pyrexia, chills, 
hypotension and hypoxia. Diagnosis of CRS requires excluding alternate causes of systemic 
inflammatory response, including infection. CRS should be managed at the physician’s discretion, 
based on the patient’s clinical presentation.  
Treatment-related neurologic TEAEs were reported for 5.8% of subjects; and only one subject had at 
least 1 treatment-related TEAE with a maximum severity of grade ≥ 3. 
Overall subject incidences of treatment-related neurologic TEAEs by PT category were low, with the 
most common being dizziness and headache (each reported in 2 subjects). Both of these events are 
included in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) has been observed with particularly 
high incidence rate and pronounced morbidity in CAR-T cellular immune therapy and anti-CD19 
immunotherapies [Lee 2019; Sheth 2021]. There have been no reports of the preferred term (PT): 
ICANS in the clinical studies and EAPs as of the data lock point. With a broadened search strategy, only 
1 grade ≥ 3 event of grade 3 confusional state considered related by the investigator was reported in 
the clinical studies. Due to its potential severe outcomes ICANS is considered an important potential 
risk due to its potential for severe outcomes. 
The number of subjects who reported treatment-emergent events of GvHD was 14 of 340 subjects in 
the clinical studies and EAPs; 8 of 202) in clinical studies and 6 of 138) in the EAPs. Overall, the 
incidence of GvHD in the tabelecleucel clinical development programme was much lower than the 
background incidence of donor mediated GvHD reported in literature. 
GvHD has been reported in 5 (4.9%) patients in the two clinical studies (ATA129-EBV-302 and EBV-
CTL-201; N=103) in which serious and non-serious AEs were recorded after treatment with 
tabelecleucel. In the overall clinical development programme, GvHD events occurred almost exclusively 
in subjects with history of transplantation: there was a single case of GvHD in a subject without 
transplant history that was reported as a grade 1 skin GvHD (rash) that occurred in a patient with a 
complicated history of chronic autoimmune skin disease that was ongoing at time of event; the event 
was assessed as related by the investigator, however, no biopsy was performed to confirm the 
suspected skin GvHD event; the event resolved within 4 days and additional doses of tabelecleucel 
were administered with no subsequent aggravation or relapse observed.   
It is not possible to ascertain whether reported events are related to the decrease or discontinuation of 
immunosuppressive therapies for the treatment of PTLD rather than to a direct action of tabelecleucel. 
The benefit of treatment with tabelecleucel versus the risk of possible GvHD should be considered 
before initiating treatment. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of GvHD, such as 
skin rash, abnormal liver enzymes in the blood, jaundice, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and bloody 
stools. To further characterise this risk, GvHD has been classified as an important identified risk and 
additional data on this risk will be collected through the planned study described in the RMP. 
TFR is an identified risk with an established causal relationship to tabelecleucel occurring generally 
within the first few days after receiving treatment. TFR presents as an acute inflammatory reaction 
involving tumour sites which may include a sudden and painful increase in the tumour size or 
enlargement of disease-involved lymph nodes. TFR may mimic progression of disease.  
Assessment report  
EMA/858618/2022  
Page 73/87 
 
 
 
Patients with high tumour burden prior to treatment are at risk of severe TFR. Depending on the 
location of the tumour or lymphadenopathy, complications (e.g. respiratory distress and cognitive 
disorders) may arise from mass effect, including compression/obstruction of adjacent anatomic 
structures. Analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or localised radiotherapy could 
be considered prior to tabelecleucel use administration for those patients in whom the location of the 
tumour could potentially lead to complications. Patients should be closely monitored for signs and 
symptoms of TFR, especially during the first cycle. 
All of these risks will be further characterised by the planned post-authorisation Safety Study (PASS) 
to describe the safety and effectiveness of tabelecleucel in patients with Epstein-Barr Virus-positive 
PTLD in a Real-world Setting in Europe. 
Laboratory findings 
None of the subjects in the Study ATA129-EBV-302 had laboratory abnormalities that were reported as 
TESAEs.  In general, the majority of shifts in laboratory parameters could be explained by other risk 
factors, including the underlying disease and concomitant medications. 
Even though no specific safety signal was identified by the laboratory results, due to the relative high 
incidence of laboratory abnormalities reported, the following have been added in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC: white blood cell count decreased, lymphocyte count decreased, platelet count decreased, 
aspartate aminotransferase increased and alanine aminotransferase increased.   
Safety in special populations 
Overall, approximately 52% to 58% of subjects in each age subgroup experienced TESAEs. Disease 
progression, pneumonia and pyrexia were by far the most common events, without considerable 
differences between the age groups. Based on available data, the elderly population (≥ 65 years of 
age) may be at increased risk of serious adverse events leading to hospitalisation/prolonged 
hospitalisation, psychiatric disorders, vascular disorders, and infections and infestations. Ebvallo should 
be used with caution in elderly patients. 
There are no data for tabelecleucel use during pregnancy or lactation and paediatric data are limited 
especially for young children. Additional information on these populations will be collected through the 
planned-observational PASS.  
Immunological events 
No events of marrow rejection were reported in the tabelecleucel clinical studies and EAPs. There is a 
potential risk of bone marrow transplant rejection based on humoral or cell-mediated immune 
reactions. 
A small number of solid organ transplant rejection was reported in the clinical studies and EAPs. 
Treatment with tabelecleucel may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. 
This could be related to the decrease or discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapies for the 
treatment of PTLD rather than to a direct action of tabelecleucel. The benefit of treatment with 
tabelecleucel versus the risk of possible solid organ transplant rejection should be considered prior to 
the start of treatment. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of solid organ transplant 
rejection.   
Only 7 subjects were evaluable for anti-HLA antibody immunogenicity assessment in Study ATA129-
EBV-302 and a single C-SOT subject was found to be anti-HLA positive post-infusion. The applicant 
presented a detailed evaluation plan for immunogenicity which will be assessed during the annual re-
assessment of the product.  
Assessment report  
EMA/858618/2022  
Page 74/87 
 
 
 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No interaction studies have been performed.  
In clinical studies, patients received ciclosporin, tacrolimus, sirolimus and other immunosuppressive 
therapies at the lowest dose considered clinically safe and appropriate. For patients receiving chronic 
corticosteroid therapy, the dose of these drugs should be reduced as much as is clinically safe and 
appropriate; as tabelecleucel has not been evaluated in patients receiving corticosteroid doses greater 
than 1 mg/kg per day of prednisone or equivalent it is recommended not to exceed such doses.  
Overdose  is  not  expected  since  tabelecleucel  is  formulated  as  an  IV  injection  to  be  administered  in 
healthcare settings. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Most reported TESAEs leading to study treatment discontinuation was related to disease progression. No 
signals were identified from the other TESAE leading to treatment discontinuation.   
Additional safety data needed in the context of a MA under exceptional circumstances 
Taking into account the totality of the available data, the CAT was of the view that the data set on the 
clinical safety of Ebvallo under normal conditions of use could not be considered comprehensive due to 
the small size of the clinical trials and the lack of a comparator in those studies.  
The CAT acknowledged that the rarity of the disease, the challenges in recruiting patients in clinical 
trials for a condition with a very short life expectancy and ethical considerations prevent the conduct of 
bigger and longer duration-controlled trials. The CAT was therefore of the view that a marketing 
authorisation under exceptional circumstances should be granted, subject to the specific obligation of 
conducting a post-authorisation safety study to describe the safety and effectiveness of tabelecleucel in 
patients with EBV+ PTLD following HCT or SOT in a real-world setting in particular with regards to the 
important identified and potential risks associated with tabelecleucel use. The applicant will also 
provide yearly updates on any new information concerning the safety and efficacy of Ebvallo. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Clinical safety data has been analysed from the data of one pivotal study, 3 supportive clinical studies 
and 2 expanded access programs, totalling 340 subjects exposed to tabelecleucel in a number of 
indications. All studies were uncontrolled. Considering the fact that the claimed indication for Ebvallo, 
Epstein-Barr Virus positive post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (EBV+ PTLD) is an ultra-rare 
disease, the relatively small subject number and heterogeneous populations included in the clinical 
development programme and the uncontrolled nature of the studies are considered acceptable. The 
most frequently reported treatment emergent adverse events were disease progression, pyrexia and 
pneumonia. The most frequently reported treatment-related emergent serious adverse was pyrexia. 
Considering the prognosis of the disease the reported safety profile is considered manageable with the 
proposed routine risk minimisation measures and will be further characterised through a dedicated 
post-authorisation safety study. 
The CAT considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the context 
of a MA under exceptional circumstances: 
•  A post-authorisation safety study (PASS) to describe the safety of tabelecleucel in patients with 
EBV+ PTLD following HCT or SOT in a real-world setting 
• 
In order to ensure adequate monitoring of safety and efficacy of Ebvallo in the treatment of 
patients with EBV+ PTLD, the MAH shall provide yearly updates on any new information

concerning the safety and efficacy of Ebvallo.

2.7.5.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP and CAT considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant 
fulfils the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.7.6.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. However, as the 
consultation was conducted with a preliminary version of the leaflet, it is recommended to carry out a 
focused test after marketing authorisation with the adopted package leaflet. The reduced testing will 
cover 2 rounds of testing with 5 participants each round. The readability guideline and the comments 
included in the QRD checklist should be taken on board. 
2.8.2.  Labelling exemptions 
A request to omit certain particulars from the labelling as per Art.63.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC has 
been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following 
reasons: 
For  the  translation  exemption,  the  Group  accepted  the  use  of  EN  only  for  the  primary  (vial)  and  all 
secondary  packaging  (cartons,  lot  information  sheet  and  package  leaflet),  with  the  exemption  of 
Germany  and  Belgium  that  requested  the  package  leaflet  to  be  provided  outside  of  the  pack  in  the 
national language so that it can be provided to the patient. Germany and Belgium accept the use of EN 
only for all the other labelling components. The Group requested, however, that the company explore 
the possibility of providing the package leaflet, inside the lid of the cryoshipper, in the national language 
(in all instances) if at all possible. If this is not possible then the requirements of Germany and Belgium, 
as a minimum, should be met. 
The QRD Group accepted the request for omission of the invented name on the immediate vial label, 
with the condition that if a global tradename is accepted, it should be included on the label.  
The Group agreed to the omission of the expiry date on the immediate label until a final shelf life is 
agreed, and that this should be reflected as a condition to the marketing authorisation upon approval 
of the product. Once a final shelf-life is established it should be presented on the immediate packaging 
label. Furthermore, the group agreed that the format of the EXP should not be MM/YYYY as this is the 
EN abbreviation but should be presented as a numerical format. The Group also considered that it 
would be helpful to include an explanation in the product information on the meaning of the MFD 
abbreviation, and on how to calculate the expiry date on the basis of the manufacturing date; it was 
highlighted however, that the expiry date should not appear in the product information.  
Assessment report  
EMA/858618/2022  
Page 80/87 
 
 
 
 
The Group agreed that in order to avoid the loss of already manufactured product, an exemption could 
be granted for those batches already manufactured to use nominal strength of 5 x 107 viable T cells 
per mL. However, once the assessment is completed, and the batches printed at risk consumed, the 
correct expression of strength should be printed on the primary vial. 
The particulars to be omitted as per the QRD Group decision described above will however be included 
in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website and translated in all languages but will appear 
in grey-shaded to show that they will not be included on the printed materials.  
A request of translation exemption of the labelling as per Art.63.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following 
reasons: 
For the translation exemption, the QRD group accepted the use of EN only for the primary (vial) and all 
secondary packaging (cartons, lot information sheet and package leaflet), with the exemption of 
Germany and Belgium that requested the package leaflet to be provided outside of the pack in the 
national language so that it can be provided to the patient. Germany and Belgium accept the use of EN 
only for all the other labelling components.  
The labelling subject to translation exemption as per the QRD Group decision above will however be 
translated in all languages in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, but the printed 
materials will only be translated in the language(s) as agreed by the QRD Group. 
2.8.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Ebvallo (tabelecleucel) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as:  
• 
It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal 
product authorised in the EU; 
• 
It has a PASS imposed either at the time of authorisation or afterwards; [REG Art 9(4)(cb), 
Art 10a(1)(a), DIR Art 21a(b), Art 22a(1)(a)]; 
• 
It is approved under exceptional circumstances [REG Art 14(8), DIR Art (22)] 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
EBV+ PTLD is a rare and life-threatening haematological malignancy that can occur after solid organ 
transplant (SOT) or haematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) due to immunosuppression. The aim of new 
treatments is to reach complete remission and prolong overall-survival and thereby reduce treatment 
related morbidity of patients with EBV+ PTLD. 
The target indication applied for by the applicant was for the treatment of patients with Epstein-Barr 
virus positive post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (EBV+ PTLD) who have received at least one 
prior therapy. For solid organ transplant patients, prior therapy includes chemotherapy unless 
Assessment report  
EMA/858618/2022  
Page 81/87 
 
 
 
chemotherapy is inappropriate. Following a request from the CHMP, and to better reflect the intended 
target population this was modified to monotherapy treatment of adult and paediatric patients 2 years 
of age and older with relapsed or refractory EBV+ PTLD. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The standard of care for first-line therapy of EBV+ PTLD is rituximab, either as monotherapy in HCT or 
mostly as a combination therapy with chemotherapy agents (e.g. R-CHOP) in SOT. Patients whose 
disease is relapsed/refractory after treatment with first-line therapy have limited treatment options 
and rapid decline with high mortality, often within 1 or 4 months, respectively (Dharnidharka 2021; 
Sanz-Caballer 2021). In a retrospective cohort study of 18 patients with EBV+ PTLD post HCT, the 
median survival of patients with rituximab-refractory disease was 1.7 months (Socié 2020). In patients 
with EBV+ PTLD following SOT who failed rituximab plus chemotherapy or did not receive a 
chemotherapy regimen, the median survival was 3 months (Zimmermann 2019). 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
An ongoing multicentre, phase 3, single arm, open label study ATA129-EBV-302 was submitted as 
pivotal study for MAA of Ebvallo (tabelecleucel) for the target indication.  
Patients with relapsed/refractory EBV+PTLD after rituximab for HCT cohort /rituximab with or without 
chemotherapy for SOT cohort are included in this pivotal study. 
At the cut-off date of the latest interim analysis (data cut-off date 05 November 2021) 43 patients had 
been enrolled. The SOT cohort (29 patients) consisted of SOT patients who had failed rituximab 
monotherapy (13 patients) and SOT patients who had failed rituximab plus chemotherapy (SOT-R+C, 
16 patients). The HCT cohort (14 patients) consisted of HCT patients who had failed rituximab.     
3.2.  Favourable effects 
At the time of the latest interim analysis, overall response rate (CR+PR) per IORA was 50% in C-HCT 
and 56.3% in C-SOT-R+C cohort after a median of 1.1 months, demonstrating clinical efficacy in the 
population of relapsed/refractory EBV+ PTLD. The median follow-up was longer in the HCT cohort 
(15.9 months) vs. 2.3 months in the SOT-R+C cohort. 
The median DOR in the C-HCT and C-SOT-R+C cohort was 23 and 15.2 months, respectively.  
42.9% of patients in the HCT and 25% in the SOT-R+C cohort experienced durable response, lasting > 
6 months.  
The K-M estimated overall survival of the HCT and SOT-R+C population at 1-year was 70.1 and 
64.3%, respectively. 
The ORR in the main study ATA129-EBV-302 is comparable with the cumulative ORR of the three 
supportive studies (50% (HCT), 56.3% (SOT-R+C) vs. 48%). 
The OS data from supportive studies are also consistent with the pivotal study results. The KM 
estimated 6-month and 1-year OS rates were 70.9% and 65.9%.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effect 
There are a number of methodological limitations in the pivotal study, including limited size for both C-
HCT (N = 14) and C-SOT (N=29) cohorts, lack of type I error in the HCT cohort and timing of analyses

which was not in line with the prespecified interim or final analyses. Reported results therefore might 
be influenced by bias, especially selection bias. However, due to the rare incidence of the condition 
these limitations were considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Conclusions on responses in paediatric and elderly subjects are limited by very small sample sizes in 
these subgroups. Additional data in these populations will be collected through the ongoing pivotal 
study and the planned post authorisation study in a real-world setting.   
Interpretation of data from supportive studies is limited by several factors, e.g. small sample size, 
retrospective assignment to the groups (C-HCT, C-SOT), inconsistency in dosing, response assessment 
only by investigator, low frequency and inconsistency in duration of follow-up. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
According to integrated analyses of pool safety data of studies ATA129-EBV-302 and EBV-CTL-201, 
(96.1%) patients had TEAEs. Most frequently reported TEAEs by PT were disease progression, pyrexia, 
and diarrhoea, followed by fatigue, cough, nausea, and vomiting. Across all 4 clinical studies 55.0% of 
subjects had at least 1 TESAE. Treatment-related TESAEs were reported for 8.9% of subjects. The 
most frequently reported TESAEs by PT were disease progression (10.9%), pneumonia and pyrexia 
(9.4%), death (6.4%), febrile neutropenia (5.4%), sepsis (4.5%), acute kidney injury (4.0%), device 
related infection (3.5%), hypoxia (3.5%). None of the fatal TESAEs were considered related to 
treatment in the clinical studies. The most frequent fatal TESAEs were disease progression in all 
cohorts. 
The AESIs assessed in the tabelecleucel clinical programme include infusion-related reaction (IRR), 
transmission of infectious agents including cytomegalovirus (CMV), cytokine release syndrome (CRS), 
and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). These AESIs constitute 4 of the 6 predetermined risks for 
tabelecleucel based on its mechanism of action, biological nature, and mode of administration.  
Additional important potential safety concerns identified by the CHMP during the evaluation include 
tumour flare, neurological events / ICANS, immunogenicity, BMT / SOT rejection and decrease in cell 
viability due to inappropriate handling of the product. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The overall safety population comprised 340 patients but this includes a large number of patients 
outside the claimed indication. In view of the rarity of the disease, the heterogeneous population 
included in the safety analysis is considered acceptable.  
Adverse events for some (but not all) of the important potential risks which were identified for 
tabelecleucel were observed in the clinical studies or in the expanded access programmes.  Due to the 
small size of the studies, it is not possible to determine with high precision the incidence of those 
events in association with tabelecleucel. These risks will be further characterised by the planned PASS 
to describe the safety of tabelecleucel in patients with EBV+ PTLD following HCT or SOT in a real-world 
setting.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Tabelecleucel demonstrated clinically significant responses in both proposed indications. Approximately 
half of treated subjects in both C-HCT and C-SOT-R+C cohorts achieved partial or complete remission. 
Durable responses, lasting > 6 months were also observed in a number of responders.  
In the therapeutic setting of r/r EBV+ PTLD, where there are no therapeutic alternatives, these results 
are considered relevant and demonstrate clinical efficacy.  
In the safety profile frequently reported adverse events were disease progression, pyrexia and 
pneumonia, followed by fatigue, cough, nausea, and vomiting. The most frequent TESAEs and fatal

TESAEs were disease progression in all cohorts and were not considered related to tabelecleucel 
treatment. A small number of events for a number of identified and potential risks for tabelecleucel, 
including CRS, IRR, TFR, GvHD and SOT rejection were also observed. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Overall, the efficacy of tabelecleucel in relapsed or refractory EBV+ PTLD patients after rituximab 
(HCT) / rituximab + chemotherapy (SOT) is considered promising and clinically meaningful in a setting 
with no standard of care therapy and a dismal prognosis. The important safety concerns which were 
observed during the clinical development programme of tabelecleucel are expected to be managed 
adequately by routine risk minimisation measures and warnings in the SmPC. Further characterisation 
of these risks will be carried on with ongoing and planned studies described in the RMP. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances was requested by the applicant in the initial submission. 
The CAT considers that the applicant has sufficiently demonstrated that it is not possible to provide 
comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use. In the context of a 
serious orphan disease, such as relapsed/refractory EBV+ PTLD which has a very low 
prevalence/incidence and patients have a short life expectancy it is acceptable to derive the evidence 
within a single arm trial with a limited follow-up period. 
Therefore, recommending a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances is considered 
appropriate. 
The CHMP endorses the CAT conclusion on marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances as 
described above. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Ebvallo is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’.  
The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusion on Benefit Risk balance as described above. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CAT review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CAT considers by consensus that 
the benefit- risk balance of Ebvallo is favourable in the following indication: 
as monotherapy for treatment of adult and paediatric patients 2 years of age and older with relapsed 
or refractory Epstein-Barr virus positive post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (EBV+ PTLD) who 
have received at least one prior therapy. For solid organ transplant patients, prior therapy includes 
chemotherapy unless chemotherapy is inappropriate. 
Based on the draft opinion adopted by the CAT and the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
the CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit- risk balance of Ebvallo in the above indication is 
Assessment report  
EMA/858618/2022

The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusion on the conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and 
effective use of the medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States 
New active substance status 
Based on the review of available data on the active substance, the CAT considers that 
tabelecleucel is to be qualified as a new active substance in itself as it is not a constituent of a 
medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.  
The CHMP endorses the CAT conclusion on the new active substance claim. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CAT reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0490/2020 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of 
Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
The CHMP endorses the CAT conclusion on the paediatric data.

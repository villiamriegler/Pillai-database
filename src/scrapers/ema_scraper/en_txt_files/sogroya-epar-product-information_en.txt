CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Sogroya is indicated for the replacement of endogenous growth hormone (GH) in children aged 
3 years and above, and adolescents with growth failure due to growth hormone deficiency (paediatric 
GHD), and in adults with growth hormone deficiency (adult GHD). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Somapacitan should be initiated and monitored by physicians who are appropriately qualified and 
experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with growth hormone deficiency (e.g. 
endocrinologists).

Paediatric GHD 
Dose titration 
Somapacitan dose may be individualised and adjusted based on growth velocity, adverse reactions, 
body weight and serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) concentrations. 
Average IGF-I standard deviation score (SDS) levels (drawn 4 days after dosing) can guide dose 
titration. Dose adjustments should be targeted to achieve average IGF-I SDS levels in the normal 
range, i.e. between -2 and +2 (preferably close to 0 SDS). 
If the IGF-I (SDS) is > 2, it should be reassessed after a subsequent somapacitan administration. If the 
value remains > 2, reducing the dose by 0.04 mg/kg/week is recommended. More than one dose 
reduction may be required in some patients.  
In patients who have had the dose reduced but are not growing well, the dose may be gradually 
increased as tolerated up to a maximum dose of 0.16 mg/kg/week. Dose increments should not exceed 
0.02 mg/kg per week. 
Treatment evaluation 
Evaluation of efficacy and safety should be considered at approximately 6- to 12-month intervals and 
may be assessed by evaluating auxological parameters, biochemistry (IGF-I, hormones, glucose, and 
lipid levels) and pubertal status. More frequent evaluations should be considered during puberty. 
Treatment should be discontinued in patients having achieved final height or near final height, i.e. an 
annualised height velocity < 2 cm/year and a bone age > 14 years in girls or > 16 years in boys which 
corresponds to the closure of the epiphyseal growth plates, see section 4.3. Once the epiphyses are 
fused, patients should be clinically re-evaluated for the need for growth hormone treatment. 
When GHD persists after growth completion, growth hormone treatment should be continued to 
achieve full somatic adult development including lean body mass and bone mineral accrual (for 
guidance on dosing see recommended dose for adults (Table 1)).

Adult GHD 
Dose titration 
The somapacitan dose must be individually adjusted for each patient. It is recommended to increase 
the dose gradually with 2-4 weeks intervals in steps from 0.5 mg to 1.5 mg based on the patients’ 
clinical response and experience of adverse reactions up to a dose of 8 mg somapacitan per week. 
Serum insulin like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels (drawn 3-4 days after dosing) can be used as 
guidance for the dose titration. The IGF-I standard deviation score (SDS) target should aim for the 
upper normal range not exceeding 2 SDS. IGF-I SDS levels in the target range are usually achieved 
within 8 weeks of dose titration. Longer dose titration may be necessary in some adult GHD patients 
(see below and section 5.1). 
Treatment evaluation  
Using IGF-I SDS as a biomarker for dose titration, the aim is to reach IGF-I SDS levels within the 
age-adjusted upper reference range (IGF-I SDS upper reference range: 0 and +2) within 12 months of 
titration. If this target range cannot be achieved within this period, or the patient does not obtain the 
desired clinical response, other treatment options should be considered. 
During somapacitan maintenance treatment, evaluation of efficacy and safety should be considered at 
approximately 6- to 12-month intervals and may be assessed by evaluating biochemistry (IGF-I-, 
glucose-, and lipid levels), body composition, and body mass index. 
Paediatric and adult GHD 
Switching from other growth hormone products  
Patients switching from a weekly growth hormone to somapacitan are recommended to continue 
administration at their once weekly dosing day.  
Patients switching from daily human growth hormone to once-weekly somapacitan should choose the 
preferred day for the weekly dose and inject the final dose of daily treatment the day before (or at least 
8 hours before) injecting the first dose of once-weekly somapacitan. Patients should follow the 
instructions for the dose presented in Table 1. 
Oral oestrogen therapy 
Females on oral oestrogen-containing therapy may have reduced IGF-I levels and may require dose 
adjustment of growth hormone to achieve the treatment goal (see section 4.4). 
In paediatric GHD doses above 0.16 mg/kg/week have not been studied and are not recommended. 
Missed dose  
Patients who miss a dose are advised to inject once-weekly somapacitan upon discovery as soon as 
possible, within 3 days after the missed dose, and then resume their usual once-weekly dosing 
schedule. If more than 3 days have passed, the dose should be skipped and the next dose should be 
administered on the regularly scheduled day. If two or more doses have been missed, the dose should 
be resumed on the regularly scheduled day. 
Changing the dosing day 
The day of weekly injection can be changed as long as the time between two doses is at least 4 days. 
After selecting a new dosing day, the once weekly dosing should be continued. 
Flexibility in dosing time 
On occasions when injection at the scheduled dosing day is not possible, once-weekly somapacitan 
can be administered up to 2 days before or 3 days after the scheduled weekly dosing day as long as the 
time between two doses is at least 4 days (96 hours). Once-weekly dosing for the next dose could be 
resumed at the regularly scheduled dosing day. 
Special populations 
Elderly (60 years or older) 
Generally, lower doses of somapacitan may be necessary in older patients. For further information, see 
section 5.2. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
Limited data on the clinical effects of somapacitan are available in paediatric GHD patients under 
3 years of age. Currently available data are described in sections 5.1 and 5.2, but no recommendation 
on a posology can be made. 
Gender 
Men show an increasing IGF-I sensitivity over time. This means that there is a risk that men are 
overtreated. Women, especially those on oral oestrogen, may require higher doses and a longer 
titration period than men, see sections 5.1 and 5.2. In females using oral oestrogen, it should be 
considered to change the route of oestrogen administration (e.g. transdermal, vaginal) see section 4.4. 
Renal impairment 
No adjustment of the starting dose is required for patients with renal impairment. Patients with renal 
impairment may need lower doses of somapacitan, but since the dose of somapacitan is individually 
adjusted according to the need of each patient, no further dose adjustment is required, see section 5.2.  
Hepatic impairment 
No adjustment of the starting dose is required for patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment may need higher doses of somapacitan, but since the dose of 
somapacitan is individually adjusted according to the need of each patient, no further dose adjustment 
is required. No information regarding the use of somapacitan in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment is available. Caution should be exercised if treating these patients with somapacitan, see 
section 5.2. 
Method of administration  
Somapacitan is to be administered once-weekly at any time of the day.  
Somapacitan is to be injected subcutaneously in the abdomen, thighs, buttocks or upper arms without 
dose adjustment.  
The injection site should be rotated every week to prevent local lipoatrophy. 
Sogroya 5 mg/1.5 mL solution for injection in pre-filled pen 
The Sogroya 5 mg/1.5 mL (3.3 mg/mL) pen delivers doses from 0.025 mg (0.0075 mL) to 2 mg 
(0.6 mL) in increments of 0.025 mg. 
Sogroya 10 mg/1.5 mL solution for injection in pre-filled pen 
The Sogroya 10 mg/1.5 mL (6.7 mg/mL) pen delivers doses from 0.05 mg (0.0075 mL) to 4 mg 
(0.6 mL) in increments of 0.05 mg. 
Sogroya 15 mg/1.5 mL solution for injection in pre-filled pen 
The Sogroya 15 mg/1.5 mL (10 mg/mL) pen delivers doses from 0.10 mg (0.01 mL) to 8 mg (0.8 mL) 
in increments of 0.10 mg. 
For instructions of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Somapacitan must not be used when there is any evidence of activity of a tumour. Intracranial tumours 
must be inactive and antitumour therapy must be completed prior to starting somapacitan therapy. 
Treatment should be discontinued if there is evidence of tumour growth, see section 4.4. 
Somapacitan must not be used for longitudinal growth promotion in children with closed epiphyses, 
see section 4.2. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with acute critical illness suffering from complications following open heart surgery, 
abdominal surgery, multiple accidental trauma, acute respiratory failure or similar conditions must not 
be treated with somapacitan (regarding patients undergoing substitution therapy, see section 4.4). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Adrenocortical insufficiency 
Introduction of growth hormone treatment may result in inhibition of 11βHSD-1 and reduced serum 
cortisol concentrations. In patients treated with growth hormone, previously undiagnosed central 
(secondary) hypoadrenalism may be unmasked and glucocorticoid replacement may be required. In 
addition, patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism 
may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of growth hormone 
treatment. It is necessary to monitor patients with known hypoadrenalism for reduced serum cortisol 
levels and/or for the need of increased doses of glucocorticoid, see section 4.5. 
Glucose metabolism impairment 
Treatment with growth hormone may decrease insulin sensitivity, particularly at higher doses in 
susceptible patients and consequently hyperglycaemia may occur in subjects with inadequate insulin 
secretory capacity. As a result, previously undiagnosed impaired glucose tolerance and overt diabetes 
mellitus may be unmasked during growth hormone treatment. Therefore, glucose levels should be 
monitored periodically in all patients treated with growth hormone, especially in those with risk 
factors for diabetes mellitus, such as obesity, or a family history of diabetes mellitus. Patients with 
pre-existing type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance should be monitored 
closely during growth hormone therapy. The doses of antihyperglycaemic medicinal products may 
require adjustment when growth hormone therapy is instituted in these patients. 
Neoplasms 
There is no evidence for increased risk of new primary cancers in  patients treated with growth 
hormone. 
In patients in complete remission from malignant diseases or who have been treated for benign 
tumours, growth hormone therapy has not been associated with an increased relapse rate. 
Patients who have achieved complete remission of malignant diseases or who have been treated for 
benign tumours should be followed closely for relapse after commencement of growth hormone 
therapy. Growth hormone treatment should be interrupted in case of any development or reoccurrence 
of malignant or benign tumour.  
An overall slight increase in second neoplasms has been observed in childhood cancer survivors 
treated with growth hormone, with the most frequent being intracranial tumours. The dominant risk 
factor for secondary neoplasms seems to be prior exposure to radiation. 
Benign intracranial hypertension 
In the event of severe or recurrent headache, visual symptoms, nausea, and/or vomiting, a fundoscopy 
for papilloedema is recommended. If papilloedema is confirmed, a diagnosis of benign intracranial 
hypertension should be considered and if appropriate the growth hormone treatment should be 
discontinued. At present there is insufficient evidence to guide clinical decision making in patients 
with resolved intracranial hypertension. If growth hormone treatment is restarted, careful monitoring 
for symptoms of intracranial hypertension is necessary. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Thyroid function 
Growth hormone increases the extrathyroidal conversion of T4 to T3 and may as such unmask 
incipient hypothyroidism. As hypothyroidism interferes with the response to growth hormone therapy, 
patients should have their thyroid function tested regularly and should receive replacement therapy 
with thyroid hormone when indicated, see sections 4.5 and 4.8. 
Use with oral oestrogen 
Oral oestrogen influences the IGF-I response to growth hormone including somapacitan.  
 Female patients taking any form of oral oestrogen (hormone therapy or contraception) should 
consider changing the route of oestrogen administration (e.g. transdermal-, vaginal hormone products) 
or use another form of contraception. If a woman on oral oestrogen is starting somapacitan therapy, 
higher starting doses and a longer titration period may be required (see section 4.2).  
If a female patient taking somapacitan begins oral oestrogen therapy, the dose of somapacitan may 
need to be increased to maintain the serum IGF-I levels within the normal age-appropriate range. 
Conversely, if a female patient on somapacitan discontinues oral oestrogen therapy, the dose of 
somapacitan may need to be reduced to avoid excess of somapacitan and/or undesirable effects, see 
sections 4.2 and 4.5. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
When somapacitan is administered at the same site over a longer period of time, local changes in the 
subcutaneous tissue such as lipohypertrophy, lipoatrophy, and acquired lipodystrophy might occur. 
The injection site should be rotated to minimise the risk, see sections 4.2 and 4.8.  
Antibodies 
Antibodies to somapacitan were not observed in adult GHD patients. Few paediatric GHD patients 
tested positive for somapacitan binding antibodies. None of these antibodies were neutralising and no 
impact on the clinical effects was observed. Testing for presence of anti-somapacitan antibodies 
should be carried out in patients who fail to respond to therapy. 
Acute critical illness  
The effect of growth hormone on recovery was studied in two placebo controlled trials involving 
522 critical ill adult patients suffering from complications following open heart surgery, abdominal 
surgery, multiple accidental trauma or acute respiratory failure. Mortality was higher in patients 
treated with 5.3 or 8 mg growth hormone daily compared to patients receiving placebo, 42% vs 19%. 
Based on this information, these types of patients should not be treated with somapacitan. As there is 
no information available on the safety of growth hormone substitution therapy in acutely critical ill 
patients, the benefits of continued treatment in this situation should be weighed against the potential 
risks involved.  
Growth hormone deficiency in adults is a lifelong disease and needs to be treated accordingly, 
however, experience in patients older than 60 years and in patients with more than five years of 
treatment in adult growth hormone deficiency is still limited.  
Pancreatitis  
There have been few reports of pancreatitis during treatment with other growth hormone medicinal 
products. It should therefore be considered in somapacitan treated patients who develop unexplained 
abdominal pain.

Sodium  
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially 
sodium-free.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Cytochrome P450 metabolised drugs 
Data from an interaction study performed in growth hormone deficient adults suggests that growth 
hormone administration may increase the clearance of compounds known to be metabolised by 
cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. The clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P450 (e.g. sex 
steroids, corticosteroids, anticonvulsants and cyclosporine) may be especially increased resulting in 
lower plasma levels of these compounds. The clinical significance of this is unknown. 
Glucocorticoids 
Growth hormone decreases the conversion of cortisone to cortisol and may unmask previously 
undiscovered central hypoadrenalism or render low glucocorticoid replacement doses ineffective, see 
section 4.4. 
Oral oestrogens 
In females on oral oestrogen therapy, a higher dose of somapacitan may be required to achieve the 
treatment goal, see sections 4.2 and 4.4. 
Antihyperglycaemic products 
Antihyperglycaemic treatment including insulin may require dose adjustment in case of somapacitan 
co-administration since somapacitan may decrease insulin sensitivity, see sections 4.4 and 4.8. 
Other 
The metabolic effects of somapacitan can also be influenced by concomitant therapy with other 
hormones, e.g. testosterone and thyroid hormones, see section 4.4. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of somapacitan in pregnant women.  
Studies in animal have shown reproductive toxicity, see section 5.3. 
Sogroya is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception.  
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether somapacitan/metabolites are excreted in human milk. 
Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of somapacitan in 
milk, see section 5.3.  
A risk to the breastfed newborns/infants cannot be excluded.  
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from 
Sogroya therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of 
therapy for the woman.

Fertility 
There is no clinical experience with somapacitan use and its potential effect on fertility.  
No adverse effects were observed on male and female fertility in rats,see section 5.3. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Sogroya has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of safety profile 
The commonly most frequently reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are (in decreasing order 
[paediatric GHD, adult GHD]) headache (12%, 12%), pain in extremity (9%, NA), hypothyroidism 
(5%, 2%), injection site reactions (5%, 1%), peripheral oedema (3%, 4%), arthralgia (2%, 7%), 
hyperglycaemia (2%, 1%), fatigue (2%, 6%) and adrenocortical insufficiency (1.5%, 3%).  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions  
The ADRs listed in Table 2 are based on the safety data from one ongoing pivotal phase 3 trial 
(52 weeks) in paediatric patients with GHD (baseline age: 2.5 to 11 years) and adverse reactions from 
somapacitan treatment. The frequencies of the ADRs have been calculated based on the frequencies in 
the pivotal phase 3 trial. 
The adverse reactions listed in Table 3 are based on the compiled safety data from three completed 
phase 3 trials in adult patients with GHD (baseline age: 19 to 77 years).  
The ADRs are listed by MedDRA system organ class and frequency category defined as: Very 
common (≥ 1/10); common (≥1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to 
< 1/1 000); very rare (< 1/10 000).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Peripheral oedema  
Peripheral oedema was commonly observed (3% in paediatric GHD and 4% in adult GHD). Growth 
hormone deficient patients are characterised by extracellular volume deficit. When treatment with 
growth hormone products is initiated, this deficit is corrected. Fluid retention with peripheral oedema 
may occur. The symptoms are usually transient, dose dependent and may require transient dose 
reduction. 
Adrenocortical insufficiency 
Adrenocortical insufficiency was commonly observed (1.5% in paediatric GHD and 3% in adult 
GHD), see section 4.4. 
Paediatric population 
The safety of somapacitan has been established in children and adolescents aged 3 years and above 
with growth failure due to GHD. The safety profile of somapacitan in GHD patients under 3 years of 
age is not established. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
There is limited clinical experience with overdose of somapacitan. 
Based on experience with daily growth hormone treatment, short term overdose with low blood 
glucose levels initially, followed by high blood glucose levels can occur. These decreased glucose 
levels have been detected biochemically, but without clinical signs of hypoglycaemia.  
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Long-term overdosage could result in signs and symptoms consistent with the known effects of human 
growth hormone excess.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Pituitary and hypothalamic hormones and analogues, somatropin and 
somatropin agonists, ATC code: H01AC07.  
Mechanism of action 
Somapacitan is a long-acting recombinant human growth hormone derivative. It consists of 191 amino 
acids similar to endogenous human growth hormone, with a single substitution in the amino acid 
backbone (L101C) to which an albumin binding moiety has been attached. The albumin binding 
moiety (side-chain) consists of a fatty acid moiety and a hydrophilic spacer attached to position 101 of 
the protein.  
The mechanism of action of somapacitan is either directly via the GH-receptor and/or indirectly via 
IGF-I produced in tissues throughout the body, but predominantly by the liver.  
When growth hormone deficiency is treated with somapacitan a normalisation of body composition 
(i.e., decreased body fat mass, increased lean body mass) and of metabolic action is achieved.  
Somapacitan stimulates skeletal growth in paediatric patients with GHD as a result of effects on the 
growth plates (epiphyses) of bones, see section 5.3. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
IGF-I  
IGF-I is a generally accepted biomarker for efficacy in GHD.  
A dose-dependent IGF-I response is induced following somapacitan administration. 
A steady state pattern in IGF-I responses is reached after 1-2 weekly doses. 
The IGF-I levels fluctuate during the week. The IGF-I response is maximal after 2 to 4 days. 
Compared with daily GH treatment, the IGF-I profile of somapacitan differs, see Figure 1. 
In paediatric GHD patients somapacitan produces a dose linear IGF-I response, with a change of 
0.02 mg/kg on average resulting in a change in IGF-I standard deviation score (SDS) of 0.32.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
Paediatric GHD 
REAL 4 (phase 3) 
The efficacy and safety of once weekly somapacitan was evaluated in a 52 weeks randomised, multi-
center, open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group phase 3 trial (REAL 4) in 200 treatment-naïve, 
paediatric patients with GHD. Patients were randomised to 0.16 mg/kg/week once weekly 
somapacitan (N=132) or 0.034 mg/kg/day once daily somatropin (N=68).  
At baseline, the 200 patients had a mean age of 6.4 years (range: 2.5 to 11 years). 74.5% of the 
patients were male.  
The annualised height velocity at week 52 was similar for somapacitan and somatropin (Table 4).

The vast majority of paediatric patients (96.9%) in the trial achieved an average IGF-I SDS level 
within normal range (-2 to +2) after 52 weeks of treatment with once weekly somapacitan (Table 6). A 
low number of patients had average IGF-I SDS above +2 (2.3%) and no patients had average IGF-I 
SDS above +3.

REAL 3 (phase 2) 
A total of 59 GH treatment-naïve GH-deficient paediatric patients completed a 26-week main period 
and a 26-week extension in a 4-arm parallel group trial with once weekly somapacitan at dose levels 
of 0.04, 0.08 and 0.16 mg/kg/week and active control arm of 0.034 mg/kg/day daily somatropin. The 
patients continued in a 104-week open-label safety extension parallel arms with somapacitan 
0.16 mg/kg/week and daily somatropin 0.034 mg/kg/day. All patients were afterwards transferred to 
once weekly somapacitan 0.16 mg/kg/week in a 208-week long-term safety extension. 
Treatment with once weekly somapcitan led to continuous treatment benefits up to at least week 208. 
Height SDS was -1.06 (change from baseline: 2.85) in 38 patients. 
Height outcome obtained at week 208 in patients switching from 0.034 mg/kg/day daily somatropin to 
0.16 mg/kg/week once weekly somapacitan at week 156 indicated that treatment benefits with daily 
GH treatment are maintained after switching to once weekly somapacitan.  
Mean IGF-I SDS remained within the normal range for all groups.

Adult GHD 
In a 34-week placebo-controlled (double-blind) and active-controlled (open) trial, 301 treatment-naïve 
adult patients with GHD were randomised (2:1:2) and 300 were exposed to once-weekly somapacitan 
or to placebo or to daily somatropin for a 34-week treatment period (main phase of the trial). The 
patient population had a mean age of 45.1 years (range 23-77 years; 41 patients were 65 years or 
above), 51.7% were females, and 69.7% had adult onset GHD.  
A total of 272 adult GHD patients who completed the 34-week main phase continued in a 53-week 
open-label extension period. Subjects on placebo were switched to somapacitan and patients on 
somatropin were re-randomised (1:1) to either somapacitan or somatropin. 
Observed clinical effects for the main endpoints in the main treatment phase (Table 7) and extension 
treatment phase (Table 8) are presented below.

a Body composition parameters are based on dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanning. 
b The primary analysis was a comparison of changes from baseline for somapacitan and placebo in truncal fat %. 
Changes in truncal fat % from baseline to the 34 week’s measurements was analysed using an analysis of 
covariance model with treatment, GHD onset type, sex, region, DM and sex by region by DM interaction as 
factors and baseline as a covariate incorporating a multiple imputation technique where missing week 34 values 
were imputed based on data from the placebo group.  
Post-hoc subgroup analysis of changes from baseline in truncal fat percentage (%) compared to 
placebo at week 34 showed an estimated treatment difference (somapacitan-placebo) of -2.49% [-4.19; 
-0.79] in men, -0.80% [-2.99; 1.39] in women not on oral oestrogen, -1.44% [-3.97; 1.09] in women on

Observed and simulated IGF-I SDS levels in the clinical study 
In the main phase of the clinical study IGF-I SDS values of 0 and above were overall achieved in 53% 
of somapacitan-treated adult GHD study patients after an 8-week dose titration period. This proportion 
was however lower in particular subgroups such as women on oral oestrogen (32%) and patients with 
childhood-onset (39%) (Table 9). Post-hoc simulation analyses indicated that the proportions of adult 
GHD patients achieving IGF-I SDS levels above 0 are expected to be higher in case somapacitan dose 
titration beyond 8 weeks would be allowed. In this simulation analysis, it was assumed that 
somapacitan dose titration was well-tolerated in all patients until the IGF-I SDS target range or a 
somapacitan dose of 8 mg per week would be achieved.

Paediatric and adult GHD 
Clinical safety 
The safety profile of somapacitan was similar to the well-known safety profile of somatropin. No new 
safety issues were identified,see section 4.8.  
Immunogenicity  
Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were uncommonly detected in peadiatric patients (16/132). None of these 
antibodies were neutralising. No evidence of ADA impact on pharmacokinetics, efficacy or safety was 
observed. No anti-drug antibodies were detected in adult patients.

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Sogroya in all subsets of the paediatric population in growth hormone deficiency (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Somapacitan has pharmacokinetic properties compatible with once weekly administration. The 
reversible binding to endogenous albumin delays elimination of somapacitan and thereby prolongs the 
in vivo half-life and duration of action.  
The pharmacokinetics of somapacitan following subcutaneous administration have been investigated 
at dose levels from 0.02 to 0.16 mg/kg/week in paediatric population (2.5 to 14 years), at dose levels 
from 0.01 to 0.32 mg/kg in healthy adults, and in doses up to 0.12 mg/kg in patients  with adult GHD. 
Overall, somapacitan displays non-linear pharmacokinetics across the investigated dose range. 
However, in the clinically relevant dose range of somapacitan in adult GHD, somapacitan 
pharmacokinetics are approximately linear. 
In paediatric GHD, a somapacitan dose of 0.16 mg/kg/week corresponds to an average concentration 
of 80.2 ng/mL and in adult GHD, somapacitan doses in the clinically relevant range correspond to 
average concentrations of 0.1-36.2 ng/mL. 
Absorption 
In adult and paediatric patients with GHD median tmax ranged from 4 to 25.5 hours at doses from 
0.02 mg/kg/week to 0.16 mg/kg/week.  
Steady state exposure was achieved following 1-2 weekly administration. 
Absolute bioavailability of somapacitan in humans has not been investigated. 
Distribution 
Somapacitan is extensively bound (>99%) to plasma proteins and is expected to be distributed like 
albumin. Based on population PK analyses, the estimated volume of distribution (V/F) was 1.7 L in 
paediatric GHD patients and 14.6 L in adult GHD patients. 
Elimination 
Following a single dose and repeated dosing of 0.16 mg/kg/week the terminal half-life was 
approximately 34 hours in paediatric GHD patients. 
The terminal half-life was estimated with geometric means ranging from approximately 2 to 3 days at 
steady state in paediatric and adult GHD patients (doses: 0.02 to 0.12 mg/kg).  
Somapacitan will be present in circulation for approximately 2 weeks after the last dose. Little to no 
accumulation (mean accumulation ratio: 1-2) of somapacitan following multiple dosing has been 
observed.  
Biotransformation 
Somapacitan is extensively metabolised by proteolytic degradation and cleavage of the linker 
sequence between the peptide and albumin binder. 
Somapacitan was extensively metabolised before excretion and no intact somapacitan was found 
neither in urine, which was the main excretion route (81%), nor in faeces where 13% of somapacitan 
related material was found, indicating full biotransformation before excretion.

Special populations 
Paediatric GHD patients 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis gender, race and body weight do not have a clinically 
meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics following weight-based dosing. 
Adult GHD patients 
Age 
Subjects older than 60 years have higher exposure (29%) than younger subjects at the same 
somapacitan dose. A lower starting dose for subjects above 60 years is described in section 4.2. 
Gender  
Female subjects and in particular female subjects on oral oestrogen, have lower exposure (53% for 
females on oral oestrogen and 30 % for females not on oral oestrogen) than male subjects at the same 
somapacitan dose. A higher starting dose for females on oral oestrogen is described in section 4.2. 
Race  
There was no difference in somapacitan exposure and IGF-I response between Japanese and White 
subjects. Despite a higher exposure in Asian Non-Japanese compared to White at the same 
somapacitan dose, White, Japanese and Asian Non-Japanese needed the same doses to reach similar 
IGF-I levels. Therefore, there is no dose adjustment recommendation based on race.  
Ethnicity 
Ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino 4.5% (15 subjects received somapacitan)) was not investigated due to 
small sample size in the development programme. 
Body weight 
Despite a higher exposure in subjects with low body weight as compared to subjects with high body 
weight at the same somapacitan dose, subjects needed the same doses to reach similar IGF-I levels 
across the body weight range 35 kg to 150 kg. Therefore, there is no dose adjustment recommendation 
based on body weight. 
Renal impairment 
A somapacitan dose of 0.08 mg/kg at steady state resulted in higher exposures in subjects with renal 
impairment, most pronounced in subjects with severe renal impairment and in subjects requiring 
haemodialysis, where AUC 0-168h ratios to normal renal function were 1.75 and 1.63, respectively. In 
general, somapacitan exposure tended to increase with decreasing GFR. 
Higher IGF-I AUC0-168h levels were observed in subjects with moderate and severe renal impairment and 
subjects requiring haemodialysis, with ratios to normal renal function of 1.35, 1.40 and 1.24 
respectively.  
Due to the modest increase observed in IGF-I combined with the low recommended starting doses and 
the individual dose titration of somapacitan, there is no dose adjustment recommendation in patients 
with renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
A somapacitan dose of 0.08 mg/kg at steady state resulted in higher exposure in subjects with 
moderate hepatic impairment with ratios to normal hepatic function of 4.69 for AUC0-168h and 3.52 for 
Cmax. 
Lower somapacitan stimulated IGF-I levels were observed in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic 
impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function (ratio to normal was 0.85 for mild and 
0.75 for moderate).  
Due to the modest decrease observed in IGF-I combined with the individual dose titration of 
somapacitan, there is no dose adjustment recommendation in patients with hepatic impairment.

5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Preclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity or pre- and postnatal development. 
No carcinogenicity studies have been performed with somapacitan.  
No adverse effects were observed on male and female fertility in rats at a dose resulting in exposure at 
least 13 and 15-times greater than the expected maximum clinical exposure at 8 mg/week for males 
and females, respectively. However, irregular female oestrus cycle was seen at all doses treated. 
No evidence of foetal harm was identified when pregnant rats and rabbits were administered 
subcutaneous somapacitan during organogenesis at doses leading to exposures well above expected 
exposure at the maximum clinical dose of 8 mg/week (at least 18-fold). At high doses leading to 
exposure at least 130-fold above the expected maximum clinical exposure at 8 mg/week, 
short/bent/thickened long bones were found in pups from female rats receiving somapacitan. Such 
findings in rats are known to resolve after birth and should be regarded as minor malformations, not 
permanent abnormalities.  
Foetal growth was reduced when pregnant rabbits were dosed with somapacitan subcutaneously at 
exposures at least 9-fold above the expected exposure at the maximum clinical dose of 8 mg/week. 
In lactating rats, somapacitan related material was secreted into milk but to a lower level than 
observed in plasma (up to 50% of level in plasma).

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Sogroya is and what it is used for  
Sogroya contains the active substance somapacitan: a long acting version of the natural growth 
hormone produced by the body with a single amino acid substitution. Growth hormone regulates the 
composition of fat, muscle and bone in adults. 
The active substance in Sogroya is made by 'recombinant DNA technology', meaning from cells that 
have received a gene (DNA) that makes them produce growth hormone. In Sogroya, a small side-
chain has been attached to the growth hormone which links Sogroya to the protein (albumin) naturally 
found in the blood to slow down its removal from the body, allowing the medicine to be given less 
often. 
Sogroya is used to treat growth failure in children and adolescents aged 3 years and above if they have 
no or very low production of growth hormone (growth hormone deficiency) and adults who have 
growth hormone deficiency. 
Your doctor will evaluate based on your response to Sogroya, if you should continue your treatment 
with Sogroya a year after starting with this medicine.  
2.  What you need to know before you use Sogroya  
Do not use Sogroya   
• 
if you or the child in your care are allergic to somapacitan or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). 
if you or the child in your care have a benign or malignant tumour which is growing. You must 
have completed your anti-tumour treatment before you start your Sogroya treatment. Sogroya 
must be stopped if the tumour grows. 
if you or the child in your care have recently had open heart surgery or abdominal surgery or 
multiple accidental injury, severe breathing problems or similar condition. 
• 
• 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
for children and adolescents who have stopped growing because of closure of the growth plates 
(closed epiphyses) meaning that you or the child in your care have been told by your doctor that 
your bones have stopped growing. 
If you are not sure talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Sogroya if: 
• 
• 
you or the child in your care have ever had any kind of tumour 
you or the child in your care have high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) as your blood sugar may 
need to be checked regularly and the dose of your diabetes medicine may need to be adjusted 
you or the child in your care have a replacement therapy with corticosteroids, because you have 
been told your body does not produce enough (adrenocortical insufficiency). Speak to your 
doctor, as your dose may need regular adjustment 
you or the child in your care have severe headaches, eyesight problems, nausea, or vomiting as 
these could be symptoms of increased pressure in the brain (benign intracranial hypertension) as 
your treatment may need to be stopped 
you or the child in your care have thyroid problems, your thyroid hormones need to be checked 
regularly and your dose of thyroid hormone may need to be adjusted 
you are a female taking oral contraception or hormonal replacement therapy with oestrogen, 
your dose of Sogroya may need to be higher. If you stop using oral oestrogen, your dose of 
somapacitan may need to be reduced. Your doctor may recommend you to change the route of 
oestrogen administration (e.g transdermal, vaginal) or use another form of contraception 
you or the child in your care are seriously ill (for example, complications following open heart 
surgery, abdominal surgery, accidental trauma, acute respiratory failure, or similar conditions). 
If you are about to have, or have had, a major operation, or go into hospital for the above 
reasons, tell your doctor and remind the other doctors you are seeing that you use growth 
hormone 
you or the child in your care develop a severe stomach ache during treatment with Sogroya as 
this could be a symptom of inflammation of the pancreas seen in treatments with other growth 
hormone products.

Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site of Sogroya should be rotated to prevent changes to the fatty tissue under the 
skin, such as skin thickening, skin shrinking or lumps under the skin. Change the place of injection on 
your body from one week to the next. 
Antibodies 
You are not expected to get antibodies against somapacitan. However, only very rarely your child may 
get antibodies. If your Sogroya treatment does not work, your doctor may test you for antibodies to 
somapacitan. 
Other medicines and Sogroya  
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or the child in your care are using, have recently used or might 
use any other medicines. 
In particular, tell your doctor if you or the child in your care are taking or have recently taken any of 
the following medicines. 
This is because your doctor may have to adjust the doses of your medicines: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone, dexamethasone and prednisolone 
Oestrogen as part of oral contraception or hormonal replacement therapy with oestrogen  
Male sex hormones (androgen medicines) such as testosterone  
Gonadotropin medicines (gonad stimulating hormones such as luteinising hormone and follicle-
stimulating hormone) which stimulate the production of sex hormones 
Insulin or other diabetes medicines 
Thyroid hormone medicines such as levothyroxine 
Medicines to treat epilepsy or fits (seizures) – such as carbamazepine  
Cyclosporine (immunosuppressive drug) – a medicine to suppress your immune system.  
• 
• 
• 
• 
48 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy  
• 
If you are able to get pregnant, you should not use Sogroya unless you are also using reliable 
contraception. This is because it is not known if it could harm your unborn child. If you become 
pregnant while you are using Sogroya, speak to your doctor immediately. If you wish to become 
pregnant, discuss it with your doctor, as you may need to stop using the medicine. 
Breast-feeding 
• 
It is not known whether Sogroya can pass into breast milk. Tell your doctor if you are breast-
feeding or plan to do so. Your doctor will then help you decide whether to stop breast-feeding, 
or whether to stop taking Sogroya, considering the benefit of breast-feeding to the baby and the 
benefit of Sogroya to the mother. 
Driving and using machines 
Sogroya does not affect your ability to drive and use machines. 
Sodium content 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3.  How to use Sogroya 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Sogroya is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) from a pre-filled pen. You can 
give the injection yourself. Your doctor or nurse will tell you the right dose and show you how to give 
the injection when you or the child in your care start treatment. 
When to use Sogroya 
• 
You or the child in your care should use Sogroya once a week on the same day each week if 
possible. 
You can give yourself the injection at any time of the day.  
• 
If you or the child in your care are changing from another weekly growth hormone therapy to Sogroya, 
you are advised to continue injecting on the same week day. 
If you or the child in your care are changing from daily growth hormone therapy to Sogroya choose 
the preferred day for the weekly dose and inject the last dose of daily treatment the day before (or at 
least 8 hours before) injecting the first dose of Sogroya. 
Changing from another type or brand of growth hormone should be done by your doctor. 
If it is not possible for you or the child in your care to inject Sogroya on your usual week day, you can 
inject Sogroya up to 2 days before or 3 days after your scheduled dosing day. The next dose you can 
inject as usual the following week. 
If necessary you can change the day of your weekly injection of Sogroya as long as it has been at least 
4 days since you had your last injection of it. After selecting a new dosing day, continue giving 
yourself the injection on that day each week.  
How long you will need treatment for  
You may need Sogroya for as long as your body does not produce enough growth hormone.  
• 
If you or the child in your care are using Sogroya for growth failure you will continue using 
Sogroya until you stop growing. 
If you or the child in your care still lack growth hormone after you stop growing, you may need 
to continue using Sogroya into adulthood. 
• 
Do not stop using Sogroya without discussing this with your doctor first.

How much to use 
Children and adolescents 
The dose for children and adolescents depends on the body weight. 
The recommended dose of Sogroya is 0.16 mg per kg body weight given once a week. 
Adults 
The usual starting dose is 1.5 mg once a week if you are having growth hormone treatment for the first 
time. If you have been previously treated with daily growth hormone medicine (somatropin) the usual 
starting dose is 2 mg once a week.  
If you are a woman taking oral oestrogen (contraception or hormonal replacement therapy) you may 
need a higher dose of somapacitan. If you are above 60 years, you may need a lower dose. See Table 1 
below. 
Your doctor may increase or decrease your dose step by step and regularly until you are on the right 
dose based on your individual needs and your experience of side effects. 
• 
• 
Do not use more than a maximum of 8 mg once a week.  
Do not change your dose unless your doctor has told you to.

For further information about your pen, see sections: Check how much Sogroya is left, How to 
care for your pen, Important information.  
Please read the package leaflet and these instructions carefully before using your Sogroya pre-filled 
pen. 
  Pay special attention to these notes as they are important for safe use of the pen. 
  Additional information 
Sogroya contains 5 mg of somapacitan and it can be used to inject doses from 0.025 mg to 2 mg, in 
steps of 0.025 mg. Sogroya is for use under the skin only (subcutaneous). Needles are not included 
54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and must be obtained separately. Sogroya pre-filled pen is designed to be used with disposable 
needles of a length between 4 mm and 8 mm and a gauge between 30G and 32G. 
Do not share your Sogroya pen and needles with another person. You may give another person an 
infection or get an infection from them. 
Do not use your pen without proper training from your doctor or nurse. Make sure that you are 
confident giving yourself an injection with the pen before you start your treatment. If you are blind or 
have poor eyesight and cannot read the dose counter on the pen, do not use this pen without help. Get 
help from a person with good eyesight who is trained to use the pen. 
55 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 1. Prepare your Sogroya pen  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
  A 
Wash your hands with soap and water. 
Check the name, strength and coloured label on your 
pen to make sure that it contains Sogroya and the 
appropriate strength. 
Pull off the pen cap. 
Turn the pen upside down once or twice to check that 
the Sogroya in your pen is clear to slightly opalescent 
or  colourless to slightly yellow. See figure A.  
If Sogroya contains visible particles, do not use the 
pen. 
  Make sure the right pen is used. Especially if you use 
more than one type of injectable medicine. Using the 
the wrong medicine could be harmful to your health. 
When you are ready to inject, take a new disposable 
needle. Firstly, tear off the paper tab. 
Secondly, push the needle straight onto the pen. Turn 
the needle clockwise until it is on tight. See figure B. 
  B 
Pull off the outer needle cap and keep it for later. You 
will need it after the injection, to safely remove the 
needle from the pen. See figure C. 
  C 
  The needle is covered by two caps. You must remove 
both caps. If you forget to remove both caps you will 
not inject any medicine. See figure C and D. 
Pull off the inner needle cap and dispose of it. If you try 
to put it back on, you may accidentally stick yourself 
with the needle. See figure D. 
  A drop of Sogroya may appear at the needle tip. This is 
normal, but you must still check the flow with each new 
pen. See Step 2. 
  D 
  Always use a new needle for each injection. This reduces the risk of contamination, 
infection, leakage of Sogroya, and blocked needles leading to incorrect dosing. 
 Never use a bent or damaged needle. 
56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 2. Check the flow with each new pen  
If your pen is already in use, proceed to Step 3. 
  E 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Before using a new pen, check the flow to make sure 
Sogroya can flow through the pen and needle. 
Turn the dose selector clockwise one tick mark to select 
0.025 mg. You may hear a faint click. See figure E. 
One tick mark equals 0.025 mg in the dose counter. 
See figure F. 
  F 
Hold the pen with the needle pointing up. Press and 
hold in the dose button until the dose counter returns to 
‘0’. The ‘0’ must line up with the dose pointer. See 
figure G. 
G 
• 
Check that a drop of Sogroya appears at the needle tip. 
See figure H. 
H 
If no Sogroya appears, repeat Step 2 up to 6 times.  
If you still do not see a drop of Sogroya, replace the 
needle once as described in Step 5 and repeat Step 1 and 
2 again.  
If no Sogroya appears when you check the flow, your needle may be blocked or damaged. Do 
not use your pen if Sogroya still does not appear after changing the needle. Your pen may be 
defective. 
57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 3. Select your dose  
• 
• 
To start, check that the dose counter is set at ‘0’. 
Turn the dose selector clockwise to select the dose you 
need. See figure I. 
  I 
When you have selected your dose, you can proceed to 
Step 4.  
If there is not enough Sogroya left to select a full 
dose, see Check how much Sogroya is left. 
The dose counter shows the dose in mg. See figures J 
and K. Always use the dose pointer to select the exact 
dose. 
  J 
Dose pointer 
Do not count the pen clicks. Do not use the pen scale 
(see Overview of Sogroya pen) to measure how much 
growth hormone to inject. Only the dose pointer will 
indicate the exact number of mg. 
Example: 1.825 mg selected 
K 
L 
Example: 1.85 mg selected 
If you select the wrong dose, you can turn the dose 
selector clockwise or counterclockwise to the correct 
dose. See figure L.  
The pen clicks sound and feel differently when the dose 
selector is turned clockwise, counterclockwise, or if you 
accidentally force it past the number of mg left. 
58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 4. Inject your dose  
• 
Insert the needle into your skin as your doctor or nurse 
has shown you. See figure M.  
M 
Make sure you can see the dose counter. Do not cover 
it with your fingers. This could block the injection. 
  Remember to change the injection site every week. 
• 
• 
Press and hold down the dose button until the dose 
counter shows ‘0’ (See figure N). The ‘0’ must line up 
with the dose pointer. You may then hear or feel a 
‘click’.  
  N 
Continue to hold down the dose button with the 
needle in your skin. 
Keep holding down the dose button with the needle 
in your skin and slowly count to 6 to make sure that 
the full dose has been delivered (see figure O). 
O 
Count slowly: 
If ‘0’ does not appear in the dose counter after continuously pressing the dose button, the 
needle or pen may be blocked or damaged, and you have not received any Sogroya – even 
though the dose counter has moved from the original dose that you have set. 
Remove the needle as described in Step 5 and repeat Steps 1 to 4. 
• 
Carefully remove the needle from your skin. See figure 
P. If blood appears at the injection site, press lightly. Do 
not rub the area.  
P 
  You may see a drop of Sogroya at the needle tip after 
injecting. This is normal and does not affect your dose. 
59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 5. After your injection  
• 
Insert the needle tip into the outer needle cap on a flat 
surface without touching the needle or the outer needle 
cap. See figure Q. 
  Q 
• 
Once the needle is covered, carefully push the outer 
needle cap completely on. See figure R.  
  R 
• 
Unscrew the needle and dispose of it carefully as 
instructed by your doctor, nurse, pharmacist or local 
authorities.  
Always dispose of the needle after each injection.  
S 
When the pen is empty, remove and dispose of the 
needle as above and throw the pen away separately as 
instructed by your doctor, nurse, pharmacist or local 
authorities. 
The pen cap and the empty carton can be disposed of in 
your household waste. 
• 
Put the pen cap on your pen after each use to protect 
Sogroya from direct light. See figure T.  
T 
To store your pen, see How to store in this booklet. 
  Do not try to put the inner needle cap back on.  
You may stick yourself with the needle. 
  Always remove the needle from your pen immediately after each injection. This reduces the 
risk of contamination, infection, leakage of Sogroya, and blocked needles leading to incorrect 
dosing. 
60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Check how much Sogroya is left  
The pen scale shows you approximately how much Sogroya is 
left in your pen. See figure U. 
U 
Example: 
Approx. 
1 mg left 
Pen 
scale 
To see how much Sogroya is left, use the dose counter: Turn 
the dose selector clockwise until the dose counter stops. You 
can select a maximum dose of 2 mg. If it shows ‘2’ at least 
2 mg are left in your pen. 
If the dose counter stops at ‘1.2’, only 1.2 mg are left in your 
pen. See figure V. 
V 
What if I need a larger dose than 
what is left in my pen? 
How to care for your pen 
How should I take care of my pen? 
What if I drop my pen? 
Example:  
1.2 mg left 
It is not possible to select a larger dose than the amount of 
mg left in your pen. 
If you need more Sogroya than you have left in your pen, 
you can use a new pen or split your dose between your 
current pen and a new pen. Only if trained or advised by 
your doctor or nurse, you may split your dose. Use a 
calculator to plan the doses as instructed by your doctor or 
nurse. 
Be very careful to calculate correctly, otherwise it may 
lead to medication error. If you are not sure how to split 
your dose using two pens, then select and inject the dose you 
need with a new  pen. 
Be careful not to drop your pen or knock it against hard 
surfaces. Do not expose your pen to dust, dirt, liquid, or 
direct light.  
Do not try to refill your pen, it is pre-filled and must be 
disposed of when empty. 
If you drop your pen or think that something is wrong with 
it, attach a new disposable needle and check the flow before 
you inject, see Steps 1 and 2. If your pen has been dropped, 
check the cartridge, if the cartridge is cracked, do not use the 
pen.

How do I clean my pen? 
Do not wash, soak, or lubricate your pen. It may be cleaned  
with mild detergent on a moistened cloth.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Sogroya is and what it is used for  
Sogroya contains the active substance somapacitan: a long acting version of the natural growth 
hormone produced by the body with a single amino acid substitution. Growth hormone regulates the 
composition of fat, muscle and bone in adults. 
The active substance in Sogroya is made by 'recombinant DNA technology', meaning from cells that 
have received a gene (DNA) that makes them produce growth hormone. In Sogroya, a small side-
chain has been attached to the growth hormone which links Sogroya to the protein (albumin) naturally 
found in the blood to slow down its removal from the body, allowing the medicine to be given less 
often. 
Sogroya is used to treat growth failure in children and adolescents aged 3 years and above if they have 
no or very low production of growth hormone (growth hormone deficiency) and adults who have 
growth hormone deficiency. 
Your doctor will evaluate based on your response to Sogroya, if you should continue your treatment 
with Sogroya a year after starting with this medicine.  
2.  What you need to know before you use Sogroya  
Do not use Sogroya   
• 
if you or the child in your care are allergic to somapacitan or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). 
if you or the child in your care have a benign or malignant tumour which is growing. You must 
have completed your anti-tumour treatment before you start your Sogroya treatment. Sogroya 
must be stopped if the tumour grows. 
if you or the child in your care have recently had open heart surgery or abdominal surgery or 
multiple accidental injury, severe breathing problems or similar condition.

• 
for children and adolescents who have stopped growing because of closure of the growth plates 
(closed epiphyses) meaning that you or the child in your care have been told by your doctor that 
your bones have stopped growing. 
If you are not sure talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Sogroya if: 
• 
• 
you or the child in your care have ever had any kind of tumour 
you or the child in your care have high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) as your blood sugar may 
need to be checked regularly and the dose of your diabetes medicine may need to be adjusted 
you or the child in your care have a replacement therapy with corticosteroids, because you have 
been told your body does not produce enough (adrenocortical insufficiency). Speak to your 
doctor, as your dose may need regular adjustment 
you or the child in your care have severe headaches, eyesight problems, nausea, or vomiting as 
these could be symptoms of increased pressure in the brain (benign intracranial hypertension) as 
your treatment may need to be stopped 
you or the child in your care have thyroid problems, your thyroid hormones need to be checked 
regularly and your dose of thyroid hormone may need to be adjusted 
you are a female taking oral contraception or hormonal replacement therapy with oestrogen, 
your dose of Sogroya may need to be higher. If you stop using oral oestrogen, your dose of 
somapacitan may need to be reduced. Your doctor may recommend you to change the route of 
oestrogen administration (e.g transdermal, vaginal) or use another form of contraception. 
you or the child in your care are seriously ill (for example, complications following open heart 
surgery, abdominal surgery, accidental trauma, acute respiratory failure, or similar conditions). 
If you are about to have, or have had, a major operation, or go into hospital for the above 
reasons, tell your doctor and remind the other doctors you are seeing that you use growth 
hormone. 
you or the child in your care develop a severe stomach ache during treatment with Sogroya as 
this could be a symptom of inflammation of the pancreas seen in treatments with other growth 
hormone products. 
•

• 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site of Sogroya should be rotated to prevent changes to the fatty tissue under the 
skin, such as skin thickening, skin shrinking or lumps under the skin. Change the place of injection on 
your body from one week to the next. 
Antibodies 
You are not expected to get antibodies against somapacitan. However, only very rarely your child may 
get antibodies. If your Sogroya treatment does not work, your doctor may test you for antibodies to 
somapacitan. 
Other medicines and Sogroya  
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or the child in your care are using, have recently used or might 
use any other medicines. 
In particular, tell your doctor if you or the child in your care are taking or have recently taken any of 
the following medicines. 
This is because your doctor may have to adjust the doses of your medicines: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone, dexamethasone and prednisolone 
Oestrogen as part of oral contraception or hormonal replacement therapy with oestrogen  
Male sex hormones (androgen medicines) such as testosterone  
Gonadotropin medicines (gonad stimulating hormones such as luteinising hormone and follicle-
stimulating hormone) which stimulate the production of sex hormones 
Insulin or other diabetes medicines 
Thyroid hormone medicines such as levothyroxine 
Medicines to treat epilepsy or fits (seizures) – such as carbamazepine  
Cyclosporine (immunosuppressive drug) – a medicine to suppress your immune system.  
• 
• 
• 
• 
64 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy  
• 
If you are able to get pregnant, you should not use Sogroya unless you are also using reliable 
contraception. This is because it is not known if it could harm your unborn child. If you become 
pregnant while you are using Sogroya, speak to your doctor immediately. If you wish to become 
pregnant, discuss it with your doctor, as you may need to stop using the medicine. 
Breast-feeding 
• 
It is not known whether Sogroya can pass into breast milk. Tell your doctor if you are breast-
feeding or plan to do so. Your doctor will then help you decide whether to stop breast-feeding, 
or whether to stop taking Sogroya, considering the benefit of breast-feeding to the baby and the 
benefit of Sogroya to the mother. 
Driving and using machines 
Sogroya does not affect your ability to drive and use machines. 
Sodium content 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3.  How to use Sogroya 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Sogroya is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) from a pre-filled pen. You can 
give the injection yourself. Your doctor or nurse will tell you the right dose and show you how to give 
the injection when you or the child in your care start treatment. 
When to use Sogroya 
• 
You or the child in your care should use Sogroya once a week on the same day each week if 
possible. 
You can give yourself the injection at any time of the day.  
• 
If you or the child in your care are changing from another weekly growth hormone therapy to Sogroya, 
you are advised to continue injecting on the same week day. 
If you or the child in your care are changing from daily growth hormone therapy to Sogroya choose 
the preferred day for the weekly dose and inject the last dose of daily treatment the day before (or at 
least 8 hours before) injecting the first dose of Sogroya. 
Changing from another type or brand of growth hormone should be done by your doctor. 
If it is not possible for you or the child in your care to inject Sogroya on your usual week day, you can 
inject Sogroya up to 2 days before or 3 days after your scheduled dosing day. The next dose you can 
inject as usual the following week. 
If necessary you can change the day of your weekly injection of Sogroya as long as it has been at least 
4 days since you had your last injection of it. After selecting a new dosing day, continue giving 
yourself the injection on that day each week.  
How long you will need treatment for  
You may need Sogroya for as long as your body does not produce enough growth hormone.  
• 
If you or the child in your care are using Sogroya for growth failure you will continue using 
Sogroya until you stop growing. 
If you or the child in your care still lack growth hormone after you stop growing, you may need 
to continue using Sogroya into adulthood. 
• 
Do not stop using Sogroya without discussing this with your doctor first.

For further information about your pen, see sections: Check how much Sogroya is left, How to 
care for your pen, Important information.  
Please read the package leaflet and these instructions carefully before using your Sogroya pre-filled 
pen. 
  Pay special attention to these notes as they are important for safe use of the pen. 
  Additional information 
Sogroya contains 10 mg of somapacitan and it can be used to inject doses from 0.05 mg to 4 mg, in 
steps of 0.05 mg. Sogroya is for use under the skin only (subcutaneous). Needles are not included 
70 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and must be obtained separately. Sogroya pre-filled pen is designed to be used with disposable 
needles of a length between 4 mm and 8 mm and a gauge between 30G and 32G. 
Do not share your Sogroya pen and needles with another person. You may give another person an 
infection or get an infection from them. 
Do not use your pen without proper training from your doctor or nurse. Make sure that you are 
confident giving yourself an injection with the pen before you start your treatment. If you are blind or 
have poor eyesight and cannot read the dose counter on the pen, do not use this pen without help. Get 
help from a person with good eyesight who is trained to use the pen. 
71 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 1. Prepare your Sogroya pen  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
  A 
Wash your hands with soap and water. 
Check the name, strength and coloured label on your 
pen to make sure that it contains Sogroya and the 
appropriate strength. 
Pull off the pen cap. 
Turn the pen upside down once or twice to check that 
the Sogroya in your pen is clear to slightly opalescent 
or colourless to slightly yellow. See figure A.  
If Sogroya contains visible particles, do not use the 
pen. 
  Make sure the right pen is used. Especially if you use 
more than one type of injectable medicine. Using the 
the wrong medicine could be harmful to your health. 
When you are ready to inject, take a new disposable 
needle. Firstly, tear off the paper tab. 
Secondly, push the needle straight onto the pen. Turn 
the needle clockwise until it is on tight. See figure B. 
B 
Pull off the outer needle cap and keep it for later. You 
will need it after the injection, to safely remove the 
needle from the pen. See figure C. 
  C 
  The needle is covered by two caps. You must remove 
both caps. If you forget to remove both caps you will 
not inject any medicine. See figure C and D. 
Pull off the inner needle cap and dispose of it. If you try 
to put it back on, you may accidentally stick yourself 
with the needle. See figure D. 
  A drop of Sogroya may appear at the needle tip. This is 
normal, but you must still check the flow with each new 
pen. See Step 2. 
  D 
  Always use a new needle for each injection. This reduces the risk of contamination, 
infection, leakage of Sogroya, and blocked needles leading to incorrect dosing. 
 Never use a bent or damaged needle. 
72 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 2. Check the flow with each new pen  
If your pen is already in use, proceed to Step 3. 
  E 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Before using a new pen, check the flow to make sure 
Sogroya can flow through the pen and needle. 
Turn the dose selector clockwise one tick mark to select 
0.05 mg. You may hear a faint click. See figure E. 
One tick mark equals 0.05 mg in the dose counter. See 
figure F. 
  F 
Hold the pen with the needle pointing up. Press and 
hold in the dose button until the dose counter returns to 
‘0’. The ‘0’ must line up with the dose pointer. See 
figure G. 
  G 
• 
Check that a drop of Sogroya appears at the needle tip. 
See figure H. 
If no Sogroya appears, repeat Step 2 up to 6 times.  
  H 
If you still do not see a drop of Sogroya, replace the 
needle once as described in Step 5 and repeat Step 1 and 
2 again.  
If no Sogroya appears when you check the flow, your needle may be blocked or damaged. Do 
not use your pen if Sogroya still does not appear after changing the needle. Your pen may be 
defective. 
73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 3. Select your dose  
• 
• 
To start, check that the dose counter is set at ‘0’. 
Turn the dose selector clockwise to select the dose you 
need. See figure I. 
  I 
When you have selected your dose, you can proceed to 
Step 4.  
If there is not enough Sogroya left to select a full 
dose, see Check how much Sogroya is left. 
The dose counter shows the dose in mg. See figures J 
and K. Always use the dose pointer to select the exact 
dose. 
  J 
Dose pointer 
Do not count the pen clicks. Do not use the pen scale 
(see Overview of Sogroya pen) to measure how much 
growth hormone to inject. Only the dose pointer will 
indicate the exact number of mg. 
Example: 2.95 mg selected 
  K 
  L 
Example: 0.7 mg selected 
If you select the wrong dose, you can turn the dose 
selector clockwise or counterclockwise to the correct 
dose. See figure L.  
The pen clicks sound and feel differently when the dose 
selector is turned clockwise, counterclockwise, or if you 
accidentally force it past the number of mg left. 
74 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 4. Inject your dose  
• 
Insert the needle into your skin as your doctor or nurse 
has shown you. See figure M.  
  M 
Make sure you can see the dose counter. Do not cover 
it with your fingers. This could block the injection. 
  Remember to change the injection site every week. 
• 
• 
Press and hold down the dose button until the dose 
counter shows ‘0’ (See figure N). The ‘0’ must line up 
with the dose pointer. You may then hear or feel a 
‘click’.  
  N 
Continue to hold down the dose button with the 
needle in your skin. 
Keep holding down the dose button with the needle 
in your skin and slowly count to 6 to make sure that 
the full dose has been delivered (see figure O). 
O 
Count slowly: 
If ‘0’ does not appear in the dose counter after continuously pressing the dose button, the 
needle or pen may be blocked or damaged, and you have not received any Sogroya – even 
though the dose counter has moved from the original dose that you have set. 
Remove the needle as described in Step 5 and repeat Steps 1 to 4. 
• 
Carefully remove the needle from your skin. See figure 
P. If blood appears at the injection site, press lightly. Do 
not rub the area.  
  You may see a drop of Sogroya at the needle tip after 
injecting. This is normal and does not affect your dose. 
  P 
75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 5. After your injection  
• 
Insert the needle tip into the outer needle cap on a flat 
surface without touching the needle or the outer needle 
cap. See figure Q. 
  Q 
• 
Once the needle is covered, carefully push the outer 
needle cap completely on. See figure R.  
  R 
• 
Unscrew the needle and dispose of it carefully as 
instructed by your doctor, nurse, pharmacist or local 
authorities.  
Always dispose of the needle after each injection.  
  S 
When the pen is empty, remove and dispose of the 
needle as above and throw the pen away separately as 
instructed by your doctor, nurse, pharmacist or local 
authorities. 
The pen cap and the empty carton can be disposed of in 
your household waste. 
• 
Put the pen cap on your pen after each use to protect 
Sogroya from direct light. See figure T.  
  T 
To store your pen, see How to store in this booklet. 
  Do not try to put the inner needle cap back on.  
You may stick yourself with the needle. 
  Always remove the needle from your pen immediately after each injection. This reduces the 
risk of contamination, infection, leakage of Sogroya, and blocked needles leading to incorrect 
dosing. 
76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Check how much Sogroya is left  
The pen scale shows you approximately how much Sogroya is 
left in your pen. See figure U. 
  U 
Example: 
Approx. 
2 mg left 
Pen 
scale 
To see how much Sogroya is left, use the dose counter: Turn 
the dose selector clockwise until the dose counter stops. You 
can select a maximum dose of 4 mg. If it shows ‘4’ at least 
4 mg are left in your pen. 
If the dose counter stops at ‘2.8’, only 2.8 mg are left in your 
pen. See figure V. 
  V 
What if I need a larger dose than 
what is left in my pen? 
How to care for your pen 
How should I take care of my pen? 
What if I drop my pen? 
Example: 
2.8 mg left 
It is not possible to select a larger dose than the amount of 
mg left in your pen. 
If you need more Sogroya than you have left in your pen, 
you can use a new pen or split your dose between your 
current pen and a new pen. Only if trained or advised by 
your doctor or nurse, you may split your dose. Use a 
calculator to plan the doses as instructed by your doctor or 
nurse. 
Be very careful to calculate correctly, otherwise it may 
lead to medication error. If you are not sure how to split 
your dose using two pens, then select and inject the dose you 
need with a new  pen. 
Be careful not to drop your pen or knock it against hard 
surfaces. Do not expose your pen to dust, dirt, liquid, or 
direct light.  
Do not try to refill your pen, it is pre-filled and must be 
disposed of when empty. 
If you drop your pen or think that something is wrong with 
it, attach a new disposable needle and check the flow before 
you inject, see Steps 1 and 2. If your pen has been dropped, 
check the cartridge, if the cartridge is cracked, do not use the 
pen.  
77 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
How do I clean my pen? 
Do not wash, soak, or lubricate your pen. It may be cleaned 
with mild detergent on a moistened cloth.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Sogroya is and what it is used for  
Sogroya contains the active substance somapacitan: a long acting version of the natural growth 
hormone produced by the body with a single amino acid substitution. Growth hormone regulates the 
composition of fat, muscle and bone in adults. 
The active substance in Sogroya is made by 'recombinant DNA technology', meaning from cells that 
have received a gene (DNA) that makes them produce growth hormone. In Sogroya, a small side-
chain has been attached to the growth hormone which links Sogroya to the protein (albumin) naturally 
found in the blood to slow down its removal from the body, allowing the medicine to be given less 
often. 
Sogroya is used to treat growth failure in children and adolescents aged 3 years and above if they have 
no or very low production of growth hormone (growth hormone deficiency) and adults who have 
growth hormone deficiency. 
Your doctor will evaluate based on your response to Sogroya, if you should continue your treatment 
with Sogroya a year after starting with this medicine.  
2.  What you need to know before you use Sogroya  
Do not use Sogroya  
• 
if you or the child in your care are allergic to somapacitan or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). 
if you or the child in your care have a benign or malignant tumour which is growing. You must 
have completed your anti-tumour treatment before you start your Sogroya treatment. Sogroya 
must be stopped if the tumour grows. 
if you or the child in your care have recently had open heart surgery or abdominal surgery or 
multiple accidental injury, severe breathing problems or similar condition. 
• 
• 
79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
for children and adolescents who have stopped growing because of closure of the growth plates 
(closed epiphyses) meaning that you or the child in your care have been told by your doctor that 
your bones have stopped growing. 
If you are not sure talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Sogroya if: 
• 
• 
you or the child in your care have ever had any kind of tumour 
you or the child in your care have high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) as your blood sugar may 
need to be checked regularly and the dose of your diabetes medicine may need to be adjusted 
you or the child in your care have a replacement therapy with corticosteroids, because you have 
been told your body does not produce enough (adrenocortical insufficiency). Speak to your 
doctor, as your dose may need regular adjustment 
you or the child in your care have severe headaches, eyesight problems, nausea, or vomiting as 
these could be symptoms of increased pressure in the brain (benign intracranial hypertension) as 
your treatment may need to be stopped 
you or the child in your care have thyroid problems, your thyroid hormones need to be checked 
regularly and your dose of thyroid hormone may need to be adjusted 
you are a female taking oral contraception or hormonal replacement therapy with oestrogen, 
your dose of Sogroya may need to be higher. If you stop using oral oestrogen, your dose of 
somapacitan may need to be reduced. Your doctor may recommend you to change the route of 
oestrogen administration (e.g transdermal, vaginal) or use another form of contraception 
you or the child in your care are seriously ill (for example, complications following open heart 
surgery, abdominal surgery, accidental trauma, acute respiratory failure, or similar conditions). 
If you are about to have, or have had, a major operation, or go into hospital for the above 
reasons, tell your doctor and remind the other doctors you are seeing that you use growth 
hormone 
you or the child in your care develop a severe stomach ache during treatment with Sogroya as 
this could be a symptom of inflammation of the pancreas seen in treatments with other growth 
hormone products.

Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site of Sogroya should be rotated to prevent changes to the fatty tissue under the 
skin, such as skin thickening, skin shrinking or lumps under the skin. Change the place of injection on 
your body from one week to the next. 
Antibodies 
You are not expected to get antibodies against somapacitan.  However, only very rarely your child 
may get antibodies. If your Sogroya treatment does not work, your doctor may test you for antibodies 
to somapacitan. 
Other medicines and Sogroya  
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or the child in your care are using, have recently used or might 
use any other medicines. 
In particular, tell your doctor if you or the child in your care are taking or have recently taken any of 
the following medicines. 
This is because your doctor may have to adjust the doses of your medicines: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone, dexamethasone and prednisolone 
Oestrogen as part of oral contraception or hormonal replacement therapy with oestrogen 
Male sex hormones (androgen medicines) such as testosterone  
Gonadotropin medicines (gonad stimulating hormones such as luteinising hormone and follicle-
stimulating hormone) which stimulate the production of sex hormones 
Insulin or other diabetes medicines 
Thyroid hormone medicines such as levothyroxine 
Medicines to treat epilepsy or fits (seizures) – such as carbamazepine  
Cyclosporine (immunosuppressive drug) – a medicine to suppress your immune system.

Pregnancy  
• 
If you are able to get pregnant, you should not use Sogroya unless you are also using reliable 
contraception. This is because it is not known if it could harm your unborn child. If you become 
pregnant while you are using Sogroya, speak to your doctor immediately. If you wish to become 
pregnant, discuss it with your doctor, as you may need to stop using the medicine. 
Breast-feeding 
• 
It is not known whether Sogroya can pass into breast milk. Tell your doctor if you are breast-
feeding or plan to do so. Your doctor will then help you decide whether to stop breast-feeding, 
or whether to stop taking Sogroya, considering the benefit of breast-feeding to the baby and the 
benefit of Sogroya to the mother. 
Driving and using machines 
Sogroya does not affect your ability to drive and use machines. 
Sodium content 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3.  How to use Sogroya 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Sogroya is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) from a pre-filled pen. You can 
give the injection yourself. Your doctor or nurse will tell you the right dose and show you how to give 
the injection when you or the child in your care start treatment. 
When to use Sogroya 
• 
You or the child in your care should use Sogroya once a week on the same day each week if 
possible. 
You can give yourself the injection at any time of the day.  
• 
If you or the child in your care are changing from another weekly growth hormone therapy to Sogroya, 
you are advised to continue injecting on the same week day.  
If you or the child in your care are changing from daily growth hormone therapy to Sogroya choose 
the preferred day for the weekly dose and inject the last dose of daily treatment the day before (or at 
least 8 hours before) inejcting the first dose of Sogroya.  
Changing from another type or brand of growth hormone should be done by your doctor.  
If it is not possible for you or the child in your care to inject Sogroya on your usual week day, you can 
inject Sogroya up to 2 days before or 3 days after your scheduled dosing day. The next dose you can 
inject as usual the following week.  
If necessary you can change the day of your weekly injection of Sogroya as long as it has been at least 
4 days since you had your last injection of it. After selecting a new dosing day, continue giving 
yourself the injection on that day each week.  
How long you will need treatment for 
You may need Sogroya for as long as your body does not produce enough growth hormone 
• 
If you or the child in your care are using Sogroya for growth failure you will continue using 
Sogroya until you stop growing 
If you or the child in your care still lack growth hormone after you stop growing, you may need 
to continue using Sogroya into adulthood 
• 
Do not stop using Sogroya without discussing this with your doctor first.

For further information about your pen, see sections: Check how much Sogroya is left, How to 
care for your pen, Important information.  
Please read the package leaflet and these instructions carefully before using your Sogroya pre-filled 
pen. 
  Pay special attention to these notes as they are important for safe use of the pen. 
  Additional information 
Sogroya contains 15 mg of somapacitan and it can be used to inject doses from 0.10 mg to 8 mg, in 
steps of 0.1 mg. Sogroya is for use under the skin only (subcutaneous). Needles are not included and 
86 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
must be obtained separately. Sogroya pre-filled pen is designed to be used with disposable needles of 
a length between 4 mm and 8 mm and a gauge between 30G and 32G. 
Do not share your Sogroya pen and needles with another person. You may give another person an 
infection or get an infection from them. 
Do not use your pen without proper training from your doctor or nurse. Make sure that you are 
confident giving yourself an injection with the pen before you start your treatment. If you are blind or 
have poor eyesight and cannot read the dose counter on the pen, do not use this pen without help. Get 
help from a person with good eyesight who is trained to use the pen. 
87 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 1. Prepare your Sogroya pen  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Wash your hands with soap and water. 
Check the name, strength and coloured label on your 
pen to make sure that it contains Sogroya and the 
appropriate strength. 
Pull off the pen cap. 
Turn the pen upside down once or twice to check that 
the Sogroya in your pen is clear to slightly opalescent or 
colourless to slightly yellow. See figure A.  
If Sogroya contains visible particles, do not use the 
pen. 
  Make sure the right pen is used. Especially if you use 
more than one type of injectable medicine. Using the 
the wrong medicine could be harmful to your health. 
When you are ready to inject, take a new disposable 
needle. Firstly, tear off the paper tab. 
Secondly, push the needle straight onto the pen. Turn 
the needle clockwise until it is on tight. See figure B. 
  A 
  B 
Pull off the outer needle cap and keep it for later. You 
will need it after the injection, to safely remove the 
needle from the pen. See figure C. 
  C 
  The needle is covered by two caps. You must remove 
both caps. If you forget to remove both caps you will 
not inject any medicine. See figure C and D. 
Pull off the inner needle cap and dispose of it. If you try 
to put it back on, you may accidentally stick yourself 
with the needle. See figure D. 
  A drop of Sogroya may appear at the needle tip. This is 
normal, but you must still check the flow with each new 
pen. See Step 2. 
  D 
  Always use a new needle for each injection. This reduces the risk of contamination, 
infection, leakage of Sogroya, and blocked needles leading to incorrect dosing. 
 Never use a bent or damaged needle. 
88 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 2. Check the flow with each new pen  
If your pen is already in use, proceed to Step 3. 
  E 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Before using a new pen, check the flow to make sure 
Sogroya can flow through the pen and needle. 
Turn the dose selector clockwise one tick mark to select 
0.10 mg. You may hear a faint click. See figure E. 
One tick mark equals 0.10 mg in the dose counter. See 
figure F. 
  F 
Hold the pen with the needle pointing up. Press and 
hold in the dose button until the dose counter returns to 
‘0’. The ‘0’ must line up with the dose pointer. See 
figure G. 
  G 
• 
Check that a drop of Sogroya appears at the needle tip. 
See figure H. 
If no Sogroya appears, repeat Step 2 up to 6 times.  
  H 
If you still do not see a drop of Sogroya, replace the 
needle once as described in Step 5 and repeat Step 1 and 
2 again.  
If no Sogroya appears when you check the flow, your needle may be blocked or damaged. Do 
not use your pen if Sogroya still does not appear after changing the needle. Your pen may be 
defective. 
89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 3. Select your dose  
• 
• 
To start, check that the dose counter is set at ‘0’. 
Turn the dose selector clockwise to select the dose you 
need. See figure I. 
  I 
When you have selected your dose, you can proceed to 
Step 4.  
If there is not enough Sogroya left to select a full 
dose, see Check how much Sogroya is left. 
The dose counter shows the dose in mg. See figures J 
and K. Always use the dose pointer to select the exact 
dose. 
  J 
Dose pointer 
Do not count the pen clicks. Do not use the pen scale 
(see Overview of Sogroya pen) to measure how much 
growth hormone to inject. Only the dose pointer will 
indicate the exact number of mg. 
Example: 7.3 mg selected 
  K 
  L 
Example: 2.6 mg selected 
If you select the wrong dose, you can turn the dose 
selector clockwise or counterclockwise to the correct 
dose. See figure L.  
The pen clicks sound and feel differently when the dose 
selector is turned clockwise, counterclockwise, or if you 
accidentally force it past the number of mg left. 
90 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 4. Inject your dose  
• 
Insert the needle into your skin as your doctor or nurse 
has shown you. See figure M.  
  M 
Make sure you can see the dose counter. Do not cover 
it with your fingers. This could block the injection. 
  Remember to change the injection site every week. 
• 
• 
Press and hold down the dose button until the dose 
counter shows ‘0’ (See figure N). The ‘0’ must line up 
with the dose pointer. You may then hear or feel a 
‘click’.  
  N 
Continue to hold down the dose button with the 
needle in your skin. 
Keep holding down the dose button with the needle 
in your skin and slowly count to 6 to make sure that 
the full dose has been delivered (see figure O). 
O 
Count slowly: 
If ‘0’ does not appear in the dose counter after continuously pressing the dose button, the 
needle or pen may be blocked or damaged, and you have not received any Sogroya – even 
though the dose counter has moved from the original dose that you have set. 
Remove the needle as described in Step 5 and repeat Steps 1 to 4. 
• 
Carefully remove the needle from your skin. See figure 
P. If blood appears at the injection site, press lightly. Do 
not rub the area.  
  P 
  You may see a drop of Sogroya at the needle tip after 
injecting. This is normal and does not affect your dose. 
91 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 5. After your injection  
• 
Insert the needle tip into the outer needle cap on a flat 
surface without touching the needle or the outer needle 
cap. See figure Q. 
  Q 
• 
Once the needle is covered, carefully push the outer 
needle cap completely on. See figure R.  
  R 
• 
Unscrew the needle and dispose of it carefully as 
instructed by your doctor, nurse, pharmacist or local 
authorities.  
Always dispose of the needle after each injection.  
  S 
When the pen is empty, remove and dispose of the 
needle as above and throw the pen away separately as 
instructed by your doctor, nurse, pharmacist or local 
authorities. 
The pen cap and the empty carton can be disposed of in 
your household waste. 
• 
Put the pen cap on your pen after each use to protect 
Sogroya from direct light. See figure T.  
  T 
To store your pen, see How to store in this booklet. 
  Do not try to put the inner needle cap back on.  
You may stick yourself with the needle. 
  Always remove the needle from your pen immediately after each injection. This reduces the 
risk of contamination, infection, leakage of Sogroya, and blocked needles leading to incorrect 
dosing. 
92 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Check how much Sogroya is left  
The pen scale shows you approximately how much Sogroya is 
left in your pen. See figure U. 
  U 
Example: 
Approx. 
3 mg left 
Pen 
scale 
To see how much Sogroya is left, use the dose counter: Turn 
the dose selector clockwise until the dose counter stops. You 
can select a maximum dose of 8 mg. If it shows ‘8’ at least 
8 mg are left in your pen. 
If the dose counter stops at ‘4.8’, only 4.8 mg are left in your 
pen. See figure V. 
  V

what is left in my pen? 
How to care for your pen 
How should I take care of my pen? 
What if I drop my pen? 
How do I clean my pen? 
Example: 
4.8 mg left 
It is not possible to select a larger dose than the amount of 
mg left in your pen. 
If you need more Sogroya than you have left in your pen, 
you can use a new pen or split your dose between your 
current pen and a new pen. Only if trained or advised by 
your doctor or nurse, you may split your dose. Use a 
calculator to plan the doses as instructed by your doctor or 
nurse. 
Be very careful to calculate correctly, otherwise it may 
lead to medication error. If you are not sure how to split 
your dose using two pens, then select and inject the dose you

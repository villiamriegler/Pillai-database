CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Replacement therapy of adrenal insufficiency in infants, children and adolescents (from birth to  
< 18 years old). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Dose must be individualised according to the response of the individual patient. The lowest possible 
dose should be used. 
Monitoring of the clinical response is necessary and patients should be observed closely for signs that 
might require dose adjustment, including changes in clinical status resulting from remissions or 
exacerbations of the disease, individual responsiveness to the medicinal product, and the effect of 
stress (e.g. surgery, infection, trauma). During stress it may be necessary to increase the dose 
temporarily.  
Replacement therapy in primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency 
Alkindi is given as replacement therapy by oral administration of granules according to clinical 
practice, in a dose to be titrated against individual clinical response.  
Recommended replacement doses of hydrocortisone are 8-10 mg/m2/day for patients with adrenal 
insufficiency alone and 10-15 mg/m2/day in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), 
typically in three or four divided doses.  
In patients with some remaining endogenous cortisol production a lower dose may be sufficient.  
In situations when the body is exposed to excessive physical and/or mental stress, patients may need 
an increased dose, especially in the afternoon or evening. 
Pre-operatively, during serious trauma or illness in patients with known adrenal insufficiency or 
doubtful adrenal reserve 
Pre-operatively, anaesthetists must be informed if the patient is taking corticosteroids or has 
previously taken corticosteroids. 
In less severe situations when parenteral administration of hydrocortisone is not required, for instance 
low grade infections, moderate fever of any aetiology and stressful situations such as minor surgical 
procedures, there should be high awareness of the risk of developing acute adrenal insufficiency, and 
the normal oral daily replacement dose should be increased temporarily; the Alkindi total daily dose 
should be increased by doubling or tripling the usual dose. Once the intercurrent illness episode is 
over, patients can return to the normal replacement dose of Alkindi. 
In severe situations, an increase in dose is immediately required and oral administration of 
hydrocortisone must be replaced with parenteral treatment. Parenteral administration of 
hydrocortisone is warranted during transient illness episodes such as severe infections, in particular 
gastroenteritis associated with vomiting and/or diarrhoea, high fever of any aetiology or extensive 
physical stress, such as for instance serious accidents and surgery under general anaesthesia. Where 
parenteral hydrocortisone is required, the patient should be treated in a facility with resuscitation 
facilities in case of evolving adrenal crisis.

Changing from conventional oral glucocorticoid treatment to Alkindi  
When changing patients from conventional oral hydrocortisone replacement therapy, crushed or 
compounded, to Alkindi, an identical total daily dose may be given. Alkindi is therapeutically 
equivalent to conventional oral hydrocortisone formulations. Where a patient is changed from other 
oral hydrocortisone formulations to Alkindi, inaccuracy in the dosing possible with other oral 
hydrocortisone formulations can lead to a relative fall in hydrocortisone exposure on the same nominal 
dose, leading to symptoms of adrenal insufficiency or crisis (see section 4.4). 
Missed or Incomplete Dose 
If a full dose of Alkindi is missed, that dose should be administered as soon as possible, as well as 
their next dose at the usual time, even if this means that the child receives two doses at the same time. 
Patients and/or caregivers should be instructed to contact their healthcare provider if most of the 
granules in a dose are regurgitated, vomited or spat out, as a repeat dose may be required to avoid 
adrenal insufficiency. 
Method of administration 
The granules must be given orally and should not be chewed. The capsule shell must not be swallowed 
but carefully be opened as follows: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
The capsule is held so that the printed strength is at the top, and tapped to ensure all the granules 
are in the lower half of the capsule. 
The bottom of the capsule is gently squeezed.  
The top of the capsule is twisted off. 
The granules are either poured directly onto the child’s tongue, or the granules are poured onto a 
spoon and placed in the child’s mouth. For children who are able to take soft food, the granules 
may be sprinkled onto a spoonful of cold or room temperature soft food (such as yoghurt or fruit 
puree) and given immediately. 
Whichever method is used, the capsule is tapped to ensure all the granules are removed.  
Immediately after administration a drink such as water, milk, breast-milk, or formula-milk should be 
given to help ensure all granules are swallowed. 
If the granules are sprinkled onto a spoonful of soft food this should be given immediately (within 5 
minutes) and not stored for future use. 
The granules must not be added to liquid as this can result in less than the full dose being given, and 
may affect the taste masking which will allow the bitter taste of hydrocortisone to become apparent.  
Do not administer via nasogastric tube as there is a risk of nasogastric tube blockage (see section 4.4). 
Detailed pictograms on how to administer the granules are provided in the package leaflet. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Patients with dysphagia or premature infants where oral feeding has not been established.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Adrenal crisis 
Where a child is vomiting or acutely unwell parenteral hydrocortisone should be started without delay, 
carers should be trained in adminstering this in an emergency. 
Sudden discontinuation of therapy with hydrocortisone risks triggering an adrenal crisis and death. 
Medicinal product-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may result from too rapid a 
withdrawal of corticosteroids and may be minimised by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of 
relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any 
situation of stress occurring during that period, corticosteroid therapy should be reinstated. 
Adrenal crisis can occur when switching from conventional oral hydrocortisone formulations, crushed 
or compounded, to Alkindi. Close monitoring of patients is recommended in the first week after 
switch. Healthcare professionals should inform carers and patients that extra doses of Alkindi should 
be given if symptoms of adrenal insufficiency are seen. If this is required, then an increase in the total 
daily dose of Alkindi should be considered and immediate medical advice should be sought.  
Immunisation 
Replacement schedules of corticosteroids for people with adrenal insufficiency do not cause 
immunosuppression and are not, therefore, contraindications for administration of live vaccines. 
Infections 
Infection should not be more likely at a replacement dose of hydrocortisone, but all infections should 
be treated seriously and stress dosing of steroid initiated early (see section 4.2). Patients with adrenal 
insufficiency are at risk of life-threatening adrenal crisis during infection so clinical suspicion of 
infection should be high and specialist advice should be sought early. 
Undesirable effects of corticosteroid replacement therapy 
Most undesirable effects of corticosteroids are dose and duration of exposure related. Undesirable 
effects are therefore less likely when using corticosteroids as replacement therapy. 
Corticosteroids may cause growth retardation in infancy, childhood and adolescence; this may be 
irreversible. Treatment should be limited to the minimum dose required to achieve desired clinical 
response and when reduction in dose is possible, the reduction should be gradual. Excessive weight 
gain with decreased height velocity or other symptoms or signs of Cushing syndrome indicate 
excessive glucocorticoid replacement. Infants require frequent assessment and should be evaluated at a 
minimum every 3 to 4 months to assess growth, blood pressure, and general well-being. 
Bone mineral density may be impacted in children when higher doses of replacement steroids are 
used. The lowest appropriate dose of steroid according to the response of the individual patient should 
be used. 
Patients/and or carers should be warned that potentially severe psychiatric adverse reactions; euphoria, 
mania, psychosis with hallucinations and delirium have been seen in adult patients at replacement 
doses of hydrocortisone (see section 4.8). Symptoms typically emerge within a few days or weeks of 
starting the treatment. Risks may be higher with high doses/systemic exposure (see also section 4.5), 
although dose levels do not allow prediction of the onset, type, severity or duration of reactions. Most 
reactions recover after either dose reduction or withdrawal, although specific treatment may be 
necessary. Patients/carers should be encouraged to seek medical advice if worrying psychological 
symptoms develop, especially if depressed mood or suicidal ideation is suspected. Patients/carers 
should also be alert to possible psychiatric disturbances that may occur either during or immediately 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
after dose tapering/withdrawal of systemic steroids, although such reactions have been reported 
infrequently. 
Rare instances of anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving corticosteroids, 
especially when a patient has a history of allergies to medicinal products. 
Visual disturbance 
Visual disturbance may be reported with systemic and topical corticosteroid use. If a patient presents 
with symptoms such as blurred vision or other visual disturbances, the patient should be considered for 
referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation of possible causes which may include cataract, glaucoma 
or rare diseases such as central serous chorioretinopathy which have been reported after use of 
systemic and topical corticosteroids. 
Excretion of granules 
The granules may sometimes be seen in stools since the centre of the granule is not absorbed in the gut 
after it has released the active substance. This does not mean the medicinal product has been 
ineffective and the patient should not take another dose for this reason. 
Nasogastric tube feeding 
Alkindi granules are not suitable for nasogastric administration as they may cause tube blockage.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Hydrocortisone is metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Concomitant administration of 
medicinal products that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 may therefore lead to unwanted 
alterations in serum concentrations of Alkindi with the risk of adverse reactions, particularly adrenal 
crisis. The need for dose adjustment when such medicinal products are used can be anticipated and 
patients should be closely monitored. 
Medicinal products inducing CYP3A4, requiring a potential increase in Alkindi dosing, include but 
are not limited to: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Anticonvulsants: phenytoin, carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine 
Antibiotics: rifampicin and rifabutin 
Barbiturates including phenobarbital and primidone 
Antiretroviral medicinal products: efavirenz and nevirapine 
Medicinal products/substances inhibiting CYP3A4, requiring a potential decrease in Alkindi dosing, 
include but are not limited to: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Anti-fungals: itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole 
Antibiotics: erythromycin  and clarithromycin  
Antiretroviral medicinal products: ritonavir  
Grapefruit juice 
Liquorice 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Hydrocortisone for replacement therapy can be used during pregnancy. Hydrocortisone is 
preferentially metabolised by placental 11βHSD2 to inactive cortisone reducing the fetal exposure. 
There are no indications that replacement therapy with hydrocortisone in pregnant women is 
associated with adverse consequences for the fetus.  
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity of corticosteroids (see section 5.3) 
Breast-feeding 
Hydrocortisone for replacement therapy can be used during breast-feeding. Hydrocortisone is excreted 
in breast milk. However, the doses of hydrocortisone used for replacement therapy probably do not 
clinically significantly affect the child. 
Fertility 
There are no data available for possible effects of Alkindi on fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Alkindi has no or negligible influence on the ability to perform skilled tasks (e.g. riding a bicycle) or 
using machines.  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
A total of 30 healthy (but dexamethasone-suppressed) adult male subjects in two phase 1 studies and 
24 paediatric patients with adrenal insufficiency in two phase 3 studies have been treated with Alkindi. 
There were no adverse reactions and no episodes of adrenal crisis seen in any of the studies. 
In clinical practice most adverse reactions have been mild and self-limiting but adrenal crisis has been 
observed at time of changing from other hydrocortisone products and monitoring of patients at time of 
switch is advised (see section 4.4). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following adverse reactions have been reported in the scientific literature in adult patients for 
other hydrocortisone medicinal products when given as adrenal insufficiency replacement therapy 
with frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Psychosis with hallucinations and delirium 
Mania 
Euphoria 
Gastritis 
Nausea  
Hypokalaemic alkalosis 
When changing a patient from other oral hydrocortisone formulations to Alkindi, inaccuracy in the 
dosing possible with other oral hydrocortisone formulations can lead to a relative fall in 
hydrocortisone exposure on the same nominal dose, leading to symptoms of adrenal insufficiency such 
as tiredness, excessive sleeping, poor feeding, or adrenal crisis (see section 4.4). 
Historical cohorts of adults treated from childhood for CAH have been found to have reduced bone 
mineral density and increased fracture rates and growth retardation (see section 4.4). It is unclear if 
these relate to hydrocortisone therapy using current replacement regimens.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Reports of acute toxicity and/or deaths following hydrocortisone overdose are rare. No antidote is 
available. Treatment is probably not indicated for reactions due to chronic poisoning unless the patient 
has a condition that would render him/her unusually susceptible to ill effects from hydrocortisone. In 
which case, symptomatic treatment should be instituted as necessary. 
The biological half-life of hydrocortisone is about 100 minutes. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Corticosteroids for systemic use, glucocorticoids, ATC code: H02AB09. 
Mechanism of action 
Hydrocortisone is a glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoids are adrenocortical steroids, both 
naturally-occurring and synthetic, which are readily absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Hydrocortisone is believed to be the principal corticosteroid secreted by the adrenal cortex. 
Naturally-occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and cortisone), which also have salt-retaining 
properties, are used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. They are also used for 
their potent anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems. Glucocorticoids cause 
profound and varied metabolic effects. In addition they modify the body’s immune responses to 
diverse stimuli. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Paediatric population 
The pivotal study was an open-label single-dose single-centre trial in 24 paediatric patients aged less 
than 6 years requiring replacement therapy for adrenal insufficiency due to CAH, primary adrenal 
failure or hypopituitarism. The study consisted of three consecutive cohorts, the first including 
12 patients aged 2 to less than 6 years, the second including 6 patients aged 28 days to less than 
2 years, and the third including 6 neonates aged from birth to less than 28 days.  
Of these 24 patients, 23 had a diagnosis of CAH and 1 had a diagnosis of hypopituitarism including 
hypothyroidism. 1 patient had renal hypoplasia, 1 patient atopic dermatitis and 1 patient had rhinitis. 
The study used a single dose of Alkindi granules equivalent to the previous morning’s dose of each 
patient’s usual glucocorticoid treatment. The Alkindi dose range administered was 1 mg - 4 mg. 
Parents/carers (and where possible children) assessed the palatability of Alkindi after administration 
using a 5-item Likert scale. 
As this was a single-dose study, the primary efficacy assessment was serum cortisol at 60 minutes. In 
all 24 patients Alkindi was found to increase cortisol values from baseline as expected: median 
baseline cortisol 14.1 nmol/l (range 14.1 - 104.5), median Cmax 535.2 nmol/l (range 346.2 - 1445.1). 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Alkindi was positively assessed in terms of palatability. Among parents and carers asked about their 
child’s experience of taking the medication (n=23), 82.6% agreed/strongly agreed that their child 
found swallowing Alkindi easy; 65.2% agreed/strongly agreed that their child showed a positive 
reaction after Alkindi administration; 95.5% would be happy to give their child Alkindi in the future; 
and 95.5% said that they would prefer Alkindi for their child’s treatment over their usual 
hydrocortisone formulation. Six of the 12 children in Cohort 1 (age range 2.6 to 4.7 years) responded 
to an adjusted palatability questionnaire. ≥50% subjects reported that the taste, feel in mouth and ease 
of swallowing were very good and that they were likely to take the medicinal product again. 68.8% of 
healthy adult volunteers have described the taste as neutral. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following oral administration, hydrocortisone is rapidly absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract and 
the oral Alkindi 4x5 mg was approximately 87% bioavailable when compared to intravenous 
hydrocortisone in dexamethasone-suppressed healthy adult male volunteers. 
The coadministration of Alkindi with soft food (yoghurt and fruit puree) has been studied in vitro with 
no significant effect on dissolution seen.  
An in vivo study in healthy volunteers showed no significant difference in overall exposure when 
Alkindi was dosed fed or fasted. 
Distribution 
90% or more of circulating hydrocortisone is reversibly bound to protein. 
The binding is accounted for by two protein fractions. One, corticosteroid-binding globulin is a 
glycoprotein; the other is albumin. 
Biotransformation  
Hydrocortisone is metabolised in the liver and most body tissues to hydrogenated and degraded forms 
such as tetrahydrocortisone and tetrahydrocortisol which are excreted in the urine, mainly conjugated 
as glucuronides, together with a very small proportion of unchanged hydrocortisone. 
The terminal half-life of hydrocortisone is about 1.5 hours following intravenous and oral dosing of 
hydrocortisone tablets and Alkindi in dexamethasone-suppressed healthy adult male volunteers. 
No studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Administration of corticosteroids to pregnant animals can cause abnormalities of fetal development 
including cleft palate, intrauterine growth retardation and effects on brain growth and development.

Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
This medicine has been prescribed for your child only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm 
them, even if their signs of illness are the same as those of the child for whom this medicine has 
been prescribed.  
If your child gets any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible 
side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Alkindi is and what it is used for 
Alkindi contains the active substance hydrocortisone. Hydrocortisone belongs to a group of medicines 
known as corticosteroids. 
Hydrocortisone is a synthetic version of the natural hormone cortisol. Cortisol is made by the adrenal 
glands in the body. Alkindi is for use in children and adolescents aged birth to 18 years when the body 
is not making enough cortisol, because part of the adrenal gland is not working (adrenal insufficiency, 
often caused by an inherited condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia).  
2.  What you need to know before you give Alkindi 
Do not give Alkindi: 
- 
If your child is allergic to hydrocortisone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed 
in section 6). 
- 
If your child has difficulties swallowing food, or is a premature baby who cannot yet be fed by 
mouth. 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your endocrinologist or pharmacist before giving Alkindi: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
if your child is unwell or has an infection. The endocrinologist may need to increase the dose of 
Alkindi temporarily; talk to your endocrinologist if your child is unwell.  
if your child has an adrenal crisis. If your child is vomiting or seriously unwell, your child may 
need an injection of hydrocortisone. Your endocrinologist will train you how to do this in an 
emergency. 
if your child is due for a vaccination. Taking Alkindi should not stop your child being 
vaccinated. Let your endocrinologist know when your child is due for vaccinations. 
if your child is due for an operation. Let the anaesthetist know your child is receiving Alkindi 
before your child has their operation. 
if your child is being fed through a nasogastric tube. Alkindi granules are not suitable for giving 
through a nasogastric tube as the granules may block the tube.  
when your child is changing to Alkindi from another hydrocortisone preparation.  
Differences between hydrocortisone preparations when changing to Alkindi may mean your 
child could be at risk of receiving an incorrect dose of hydrocortisone in the first week after 
switching to Alkindi. This may lead to a risk of adrenal crisis. You should watch your child 
carefully in the week after changing to Alkindi. Your doctor will tell you when you can increase 
the dose of Alkindi if there are symptoms of adrenal crisis such as unusual tiredness, headache, 
a raised or low temperature or vomiting. If this happens medical attention should be sought right 
away.  
You should not stop giving Alkindi without checking with your endocrinologist as this could make 
your child seriously unwell very quickly. 
As Alkindi is replacing the normal hormone your child lacks, side effects are less likely, however: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Too much Alkindi can affect your child’s growth, so your endocrinologist will adjust the dose 
depending on your child’s size and monitor your child’s growth carefully. Let your 
endocrinologist know if you are worried about your child’s growth (see section 4). 
Too much Alkindi can affect your child’s bones so your endocrinologist will adjust the dose 
depending on your child’s size. 
Some adult patients taking hydrocortisone became anxious, depressed or confused. It is not 
known if this would happen with children, but tell your endocrinologist if your child develops 
any unusual behaviour after starting Alkindi (see section 4). 
In some patients with allergies to other medicines, allergy to hydrocortisone has been seen. Tell 
your endocrinologist straight away if your child has any reaction like swelling or shortness of 
breath after being given Alkindi. 
Contact your endocrinologist if your child has blurred vision or other visual disturbances. 
Alkindi granules can sometimes appear in a child’s nappy or poo after taking Alkindi. This is because 
the centre of the granule is not absorbed in the gut after it has released the medicine. This does not 
mean the medicine will not work and you do not need to give your child another dose. 
Other medicines and Alkindi 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Some medicines can affect the way that Alkindi works, and may mean that your endocrinologist needs 
to alter your child’s dose of Alkindi. 
Your endocrinologist may need to increase your child’s dose of Alkindi if your child take certain 
medicines, including: 
- 
- 
- 
Medicines used to treat epilepsy: phenytoin, carbamazepine, and oxcarbazepine. 
Medicines used to treat infections (antibiotics): rifampicin and rifabutin. 
Medicines called barbiturates, which can be used to treat convulsions (including phenobarbital 
and primidone). 
Medicines used to treat AIDS: efavirenz and nevirapine. 
- 
Your endocrinologist may need to decrease your child’s dose of Alkindi if your child take certain 
medicines, including: 
- 
- 
- 
Medicines used to treat fungal diseases: itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole. 
Medicines used to treat infections (antibiotics): erythromycin and clarithromycin.  
Medicine used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and AIDS: ritonavir. 
Alkindi with food and drink 
Some food and drink may affect the way Alkindi works, and may need your doctor to decrease your 
child’s dose. These include: 
Grapefruit juice. 
- 
Liquorice. 
- 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Hydrocortisone can be used during pregnancy and breast-feeding when the body is not making enough 
cortisol. 
There is no information on any effects of Alkindi on fertility. 
Driving and using machines 
Alkindi has no influence on a child’s ability to perform skilled tasks (e.g. riding a bicycle) or using 
machines. 
3. 
How to give Alkindi 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor, nurse or pharmacist has told you. Check with them if 
you are not sure.  
Your endocrinologist will decide on the right dose of Alkindi based on your child’s weight or size 
(body surface area) and then adjust the dose of Alkindi as your child grows. During illnesses, around 
the time of surgery and during times of serious stress, your endocrinologist may recommend additional 
doses of Alkindi and may also advise that your child receives another corticosteroid instead of, or as 
well as, Alkindi. 
How to give this medicine 
The granules should be given into the mouth and should not be chewed. The capsule shell should not 
be swallowed but should be carefully opened as follows: 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you give more Alkindi than you should 
If you give your child more Alkindi than you should, contact your endocrinologist or pharmacist for 
further advice as soon as possible. 
If you forget to give Alkindi or your child had incomplete dose 
If a full dose of Alkindi is missed, give your child that dose as soon as you remember, as well as their 
next dose at the usual time, even if this means that your child receives two doses at the same time. 
Contact your healthcare provider if your child regurgitates, vomits or spits out most of the granules in 
a dose administered, as a repeat dose may be required to avoid adrenal insufficiency. 
If you stop giving Alkindi 
Do not stop giving your child Alkindi without asking your endocrinologist first. Stopping the medicine 
suddenly could quickly make your child very unwell. 
If your child becomes unwell 
Tell your endocrinologist or pharmacist if your child becomes ill, suffers severe stress, gets injured or 
is about to have surgery because your endocrinologist may need to increase the dose of Alkindi in 
these circumstances (see section 2). 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
The following side effects have been reported for hydrocortisone medicines used to replace cortisol: 
Frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data): 
- 
- 
- 
Changes in behaviour including: 
- 
loss of contact with reality (psychosis) with sensations that are not real (hallucinations)

If your child has a dramatic change in behaviour, contact your endocrinologist (see section 2). 
Stomach pains (gastritis) or feeling sick (nausea). 
Contact your endocrinologist if your child complains of these. 
Changes in blood potassium levels, leading to excessive alkalinity of body tissues or fluids 
(hypokalaemic alkalosis). 
Your endocrinologist will monitor your child’s potassium levels to check for any changes. 
Long-term treatment with hydrocortisone may be associated with changes in the development of bones 
and reduced growth. Your endocrinologist will monitor your child’s growth and bones (see section 2). 
Reporting of side effects 
If your child gets any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side

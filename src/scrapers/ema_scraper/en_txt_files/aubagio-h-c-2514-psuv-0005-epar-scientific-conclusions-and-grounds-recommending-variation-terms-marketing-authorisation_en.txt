Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for AUBAGIO, the scientific conclusions of 
PRAC are as follows:  
During  the  assessment  period  of  this  PSUR,  the  PRAC  became  aware  of  the  recently  identified  Drug 
Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) related to leflunomide, and the SmPC of 
leflunomide-containing  medicinal  products  was  updated.  Although  no  cases  of  severe  skins  reactions 
have been reported with teriflunomide in the clinical trials, the PRAC considered it appropriate to request 
an update of the SmPC and include the information that in patients treated with leflunomide, the parent 
compound, very rare cases of DRESS have been reported.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for AUBAGIO, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance teriflunomide is favourable subject to 
the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

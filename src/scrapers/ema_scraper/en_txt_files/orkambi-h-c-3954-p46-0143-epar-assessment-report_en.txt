1.  Introduction 
On 19 November 2019, the MAH submitted a completed study for Orkambi, that included a subgroup 
of 30 paediatric patients, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that Study 117  is a stand-alone study. 
The  MAH  states  that  According  to  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006  of  the  European 
Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006, Vertex Pharmaceuticals is submitting information 
on  a  paediatric  study  completed  on  20  October  2017.  Study  Title:  “A  Multicenter,  Retrospective, 
Real-World, Observational Study on Orkambi Use”.  
CHMP comment 
The  submission  was  received  on  19  November  2019,  thus  not  within  6  months  of  study  completion, 
this is not in accordance with the regulation.  
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Orkambi was not supplied by Vertex during this study; Orkambi was prescribed by a patient’s physician 
in  accordance  with  the  US  prescribing  information  (USPI)  and  as  part  of  the  patient’s  overall 
therapeutic strategy. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: Study VX16 809 117, A Multicenter, Retrospective, Real-world, 
Observational Study on ORKAMBI Use. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study VX16 809 117, A Multicenter, Retrospective, Real-world, Observational Study on 
Orkambi Use. 
Description 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
To evaluate ORKAMBI treatment patterns, effectiveness, and initiation experience in patients aged 12 
and older with CF F/F who initiated ORKAMBI between July 2015 and September 2015 (early initiators) 
or October 2015 and December 2015 (late initiators). 
The  outcomes  of  interest  included  whether  the  patient  was  an  early  or  late  initiator  (months  1–3  vs. 
months  3–6  post-  ORKAMBI  market  uptake),  treatment  patterns  (e.g.,  ORKAMBI  discontinuation),

effectiveness, and site characteristics (e.g., availability of ORKAMBI treatment protocol). Early and late 
initiators  of  ORKAMBI  were  distinguished  because  the  difference  in  the  degree  of  disease  severity—
being greater in the early initiators—might influence the effectiveness of ORKAMBI. 
Study design 
This was a multicenter, retrospective, observational study to explore real-world use and effectiveness 
of ORKAMBI in CF F/F patients in the US who were 12 years of age or older. The study was conducted 
at 8 US academic centers. 
Up to 300 cases (approximately 150 early and 150 late initiators) were to be randomly selected by the 
contract  research  organization  (CRO)  for  inclusion  in  the  study;  selected  patients  had  de-identified, 
retrospective data abstracted from their patient medical records entered into an eCRF.   
A schematic of the study design is provided in Figure 1. 
Figure 1: Overview of study design 
Case Ascertainment Period and Index Date 
The  case  ascertainment  period  was  from  July  1,  2015  through  December  31,  2015.  Patients  whose 
ORKAMBI  index  date  occurred  between  July  2015  and  September  2015  were  considered  to  be  “early 
initiators”  and  patients  whose  ORKAMBI  index  date  occurred  between  October  2015  and  December 
2015  were  defined  as  late  initiators.  For  patients  for  whom  fill  date  was  unavailable,  initiation  of 
ORKAMBI (i.e., index date) was based on the prescription date. 
Analysis Period 
The analysis period was unique to each patient and comprised two main periods anchored to the index 
date: 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/611137/2020

•  Pre-index  date  period:  from  12  months  before  the  first  day  of  the  case  ascertainment  period  (i.e., 
July  1,  2014)  to  one  day  before  the  case-specific  index  event  date.  A  minimum  of  12  months 
(maximum of 18 months) of pre-index data from each case was available. 
• Post-index date period: from the case-specific index date to: 
• Six months (June 30, 2016) after the last day (December 31, 2015) of the case ascertainment period 
for the first data abstraction; a minimum of six months (maximum of 12 months) of post-index data 
from each case was available 
•  Twelve  months  (December  31,  2016)  after  the  last  day  (December  31,  2015)  of  the  case 
ascertainment  period  for  the  second  data  abstraction;  a  minimum  of  12  months  (maximum  of  18 
months) of post-index data from each case was available 
Data Abstraction Period 
Patient  medical  charts  were  reviewed  by  local  site  staff  for  relevant  study  data.  The  two  data 
abstractions for each case were: 
•  First  data  abstraction:  occurred  after  June  30,  2016;  data  was  collected  from  July  1,  2014  through 
June 30, 2016 (up to 24 months of data from each case) 
•  Second  data  abstraction:  occurred  after  December  31,  2016;  data  was  collected  from  July  1, 2016 
through  December  31,  2016  (six  months  of  additional  data  to  the  first  data  abstraction;  up  to  30 
months of total data from each case) 
Study population /Sample size 
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 
Patients who met all inclusion criteria were eligible for enrolment into the study:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
have a confirmed diagnosis of CF,  
being homozygous for F508del (as documented in the patient’s medical record),  
being 12 years or older on the index date (i.e., first filled ORKAMBI prescription or issue date 
of the prescription);  
have an index date within the case ascertainment period (July 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015). 
Patients  who  participated  in  any  clinical  study  evaluating  ORKAMBI  as  an  investigational  study  drug 
within 12 months before the first day of the case-ascertainment period (i.e., between July 1, 2014 and 
July 1, 2015) were excluded from the study. 
Sample Size Considerations 
This study was not powered for statistical comparisons, as the objectives were descriptive in nature. A 
target sample size of up to 300 cases was decided, stratified by timing of initiation of ORKAMBI: 
• Early-patient initiation cohort (index date between July 1, 2015 and September 30, 2015) 
• Late-patient initiation cohort (index date between October 1, 2015 and December 31, 2015) 
Treatments 
Orkambi was prescribed by each patient’s physician in accordance with the US Prescribing Information 
(USPI)  and  as  part  of  routine  clinical  care.  Per  the  Orkambi  US  Product  Information,  the  dosing

regimen  for  CF  patients  who  are  homozygous  for  F508del  and  aged  12  years  and  older  is  2  tablets 
(each containing LUM 200 mg/IVA 125 mg) taken orally every 12 hours (q12h). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Data Sources 
Data sources were patient medical records. 
Site  information  was  collected  from  a  one-time,  study-specific  survey  completed  by  site investigators 
(note: This is distinct from the feasibility survey administered during site selection.). 
This survey collected general information specific to the site (e.g., size of site and treatment of adult 
and/or  pediatric  patients)  and  to  general  treatment  practice  by  investigators  at  the  site  (e.g., 
availability and timing of implementation of ORKAMBI treatment protocol [defined as site development 
and/or implementation of guidance regarding managing patients who initiated on ORKAMBI]).

Statistical Methods 
Analysis Set 
The All Subjects Set, also referred to as the overall population, was defined as all subjects included in 
this  retrospective  study,  and  who  met  all  eligibility  criteria.  The  All  Subjects  Set  was  used  for  all 
ORKAMBI utilization patterns and effectiveness analyses, unless specified otherwise, and included the 
following  exhaustive,  two  subpopulations:  1)  early-patient  initiation  population,  and  2)  late-patient 
initiation population. 
Data Analysis 
The  final  analyses  were  performed  in  SAS®  v9.4  following  database  lock  All  data  analyses  were 
descriptive and based on observed trends over time. No hypothesis testing was performed. 
Missing Data 
Missing data was expected due to the retrospective design of the study. The number and proportion of 
missing  data  was  reported  for  each  variable.  Incomplete/missing  data  will  not  be  imputed  except 
for partially missing dates.  
Significance Levels and Multiplicity 
As  the  study  was  descriptive  in  nature,  no  statistical  tests  or  significance  levels  were  calculated. 
However,  mean  within-group  change  from  baseline  scores  for  key  continuous  outcomes  (e.g.,  FEV1 
and  BMI)  were  presented  with  95%  CI  estimates  to  evaluate  whether  they  differed  from  zero.  There 
were no adjustments for multiplicity. 
Safety and Monitoring Reporting 
This  was  a  non-interventional  study  based  on  the  retrospective  and  secondary  use  of  data,  thus, 
reporting of suspected adverse reactions as individual case safety reports (ICSR) was not required.

Study Population 
Study Sites 
Eight sites participated in the study. The location of the sites was well distributed across the US with 
two each in the Midwest, Southeast, and Southwest, and one each in the Northeast and West.  
Patient Sampling

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

Sites identified the medical records of all patients at their site who had been prescribed ORKAMBI and 
who  met  the  eligibility  criteria  (i.e.,  eligible  cases).  This  list  of  cases  constituted  the  sampling  frame 
from which sampling into the study occurred. For patients for whom fill date was unavailable, initiation 
of ORKAMBI (i.e., index date) was based on the prescription date. The intent of sampling was to aim 
for balanced representation of cases in the early- and late-patient initiation cohorts (approximately 150 
cases  per  group)  and  if  feasible,  to  ensure  balanced  representation  of  cases  within  each  group  by 
month  of  ORKAMBI  initiation.  Due  to  the  high  number  of  available  patients  in  the  early-initiation 
cohort,  a  random  sample  was  selected,  whereas  all  eligible  late-initiation  patients  were  enrolled. 
Ensuring balance of representation by month of ORKAMBI initiation was also not possible.  
Sites  identified  an  overall  sampling  frame  of  419  potentially  eligible  patients  with  CF  who  initiated 
treatment with ORKAMBI  during the case ascertainment period. Two hundred and one (201) patients 
(48.0%) were excluded from the study for the following reasons: 121 (28.9%) from the early initiator 
cohort were not randomly sampled into the study, 29 (6.9%) were selected for inclusion in the study 
but  data  abstraction  was  not  completed  and  51  (12.2%)  were  not  eligible.  Therefore,  a  total  of  218 
patients  were  enrolled  and  included  in  the  final  analysis.  In  the  final  enrolled  cohort,  131  patients 
(60.1%) were classified as early-initiators and 87 patients (39.9%) were classified as late-initiators. An 
overview of patient sampling is included in Figure 2.

CHMP comment 
Out of 419 patients with CF who initiated treatment with Orkambi during the case ascertainment period 
at the 8 US Sites, only 218  patients were included in the final analysis (131/292 early initiators, 45%; 
and  87/127  late  initiators,  68.5%);  therefore,  a  balanced  representation  of  cases  within  the  two 
groups was not fully achieved.  
Due  to  the  lower  than  expected  number  of  late  initiators,  all  eligible  late-initiation  patients  were 
enrolled.  Conversely,  in  the  early-initiation  cohort,  a  random  sample  was  selected.    Other  exclusions 
were  due  to  the  following  reasons:  patients  find  to  be  ineligible  (28  early  initiators  and  23  late 
initiators), or with incomplete data (29 subjects). 
The  MAH  identified  in  the  market  access  (most  patients  received  ORKAMBI  within  the  first  three 
months post-market uptake vs. three to six months post-market uptake) the main reason of having a 
lower  number  of  available  late-initiators  patients  as  compared  to  early-initiators.  However,  the 
distribution of enrolled subjects across sites and initiation group appears broad.  
The topic of this variation is the submission of paediatric data (i.e. 12-17 years old patients enrolled in 
the  study).  The  MAH  should  provide  the  distribution  of  paediatric  patients  (i.e.,  number  eligible  and 
enrolled) across sites.  
Baseline data 
Demographics 
Demographics are summarized in Table 3.  
Table 3: Patient demographics overall and by initiation cohorts 
CHMP comment 
Out of 218 patients enrolled in Study 117, only 30 (13.8%) were paediatric patients 12-17 years of 
age), including 17 (13%) early initiation patients and 13 (14.9%) late initiation patients. The focus of 
this submission is to provide data on real-world use and effectiveness of ORKAMBI in CF F/F patients in 
the US who were 12 years or older. For this reason, the assessment of results for the whole study 
population, as submitted by the MAH, is out of the scope of this AR.

ORKAMBI Utilization 
In the overall study population, the following results were observed: 
• Overall, most patients received a full dose of Orkambi at treatment initiation (86.2%), with few 
patients receiving a half dose (12.4%) or quarter dose (1.4%) 
• Of the total 217 participants with available discontinuation status data, 75 (34.6%) subjects 
discontinued the study, of which 39 (52.0%) were due to respiratory adverse events (AE). One 
additional patient had unknown discontinuation status. 
• The most common reason for a dose decrease (57.1%) or treatment interruption (50.0%) was 
respiratory adverse event (AE); the most common reason for a dose increase was “AE resolved” 
(21.1%) 
• A higher discontinuation rate was observed in early initiator (53/131, 40.5%) versus late initiator 
(22/86, 25.6%) Group. 
• A lower discontinuation rate was observed among patients with baseline ppFEV1 ≥40%.

CHMP comment 
Among the 30 paediatric patients, 27 subjects (90%) received the full dose (2 tablets twice a day) and 
3 subjects (10%) received half dose (1 tablet twice a day) within 12–months post Orkambi initiation. 
All three subjects, who re-initiated after first discontinuation, received the full dose.

CHMP comment 
Among the 30 paediatric subjects enrolled in the Study, 26 experienced no dose adjustment during the 
12 months post-index period. 4 subjects experienced two dose adjustments, due to the followings (1 
each): menstrual AE, AE resolving, other reason, unknown. 
4 paediatric subjects experienced at least one dose increased; 2 subjects experienced at least one 
dose decreased, and 2 subjects had at least one Orkambi dose interruption. 
8/ 30 (26.7%) paediatric subjects discontinued after index event: of these, 7/8 did not experience any 
Orkambi dose adjustment prior to discontinuation, 1 subject experienced at least 1 dose increase and 
one subject dose interruption.  
One paediatric subject discontinued after first re-initiation.

CHMP comment 
Among the 30 paediatrics patients, 4 early initiators and 4 late initiators (8/30, 26.7% overall) 
discontinued Orkambi following first initiation, due to the following reasons: lack of effectiveness 1 
patient, Gastrointestinal AE 1 patient, other AE 4 patients and other reason 2 patients. 
Among the 8 paediatric patients that discontinued Orkambi, 3 patients re-initiated Orkambi following 
the first discontinuation and one patient discontinued following second initiation. 
In the majority of cases (6 out of 8, 75%), Orkambi was discontinued within four months of treatment 
initiation. 
Efficacy results 
ORKAMBI Effectiveness 
In the overall study population, the following results were observed: 
•  Spirometry:  The  mean  (SE)  ppFEV1  value  was  61.4  (1.77)  at  baseline.  An  absolute  change  of  -
0.4% (CI: -2.0, 1.3) was observed in ppFEV1 from baseline. 
• BMI:  The mean (SE) BMI was 21.2 (0.23) kg/m2 at baseline. An absolute change of 0.4 kg/m2 (CI: 
0.2, 0.6) was observed in BMI from baseline. 
•  PEx:  The  annualized  rate  of  PEx  was  reduced  from  2.1  in  the  12-month pre-index  period  to  1.9  in 
the 12-month post-index period. The percent of patients with at least 1 PEx  event was 78.4% in the 
pre-index period versus 72.5% in the post-index period.

• Healthcare Resource Utilization: The percent of patients with at least 1 hospitalization was 61.0% 
in the pre-index period versus 54.1% in the post-index period.  A change of -1.3 (2.8 pre-index vs. 1.6 
post-index) was observed in the annualized rate of hospitalizations.  
The mean (SD) number of acute antibiotic prescriptions per patient per year was 6.9 (7.2) in the 12-
month pre-index period and 7.2 (8.76) in the 12-month post-index period. The percent of patients with 
at least 1 intravenous acute antibiotic was 61.5% in the pre-index period and 55.5% in the post-index 
period. 
•  Cultures:  In  the  overall  cohort,  positive  cultures  for  any  mucoid  or  non-mucoid  Pseudomonas 
Aeruginosa were detected in about two-thirds of patients (66.1%) before ORKAMBI initiation compared 
to 64.2% after ORKAMBI initiation.  
•  Transplants:  Seven  patients  (3.2%)  required  at  least  one  transplant  after  ORKAMBI  initiation  (all 
seven  were  lung  transplants),  of  which  6  patients  were  early-initiators,  compared  to  no  patients 
requiring  transplant  prior  to  Orkambi  initiation  and  2  patients  with  unknown  prior  transplant  before 
Orkambi initiation.  
•  Deaths:  There  were  2  (0.9%)  deaths  observed  during  the  post-index  period,  of  which  1  occurred 
while on ORKAMBI treatment with unknown cause.  
CHMP comment:  
Effectiveness study results stratified by age (12-<18 and ≥18) have not been provided.  
Subgroup  analyses  in  the  paediatric  patients  (12-<18  years  old)  have  been  provided  only  for  drug 
utilization data (frequencies of study discontinuation, re-initiation and dose adjustments).  
Among  the  effectiveness  variables  collected  in  the  study  the  following  are  considered  of  interest: 
Clinical  outcomes  (BMI,  ppFEV1,  weight,  and  PEx),  Healthcare  resource  utilization  (Inpatient 
hospitalizations;  Outpatient  visits,  Acute  antibiotic  use  including  IV  antibiotic,  Other  CF  medications 
use); Other Outcomes [Microbiology: (e.g., Pseudomonas); Death; Transplantation]. 
The  MAH  is  requested  to  submit  descriptive  data  regarding  Orkambi  effectiveness  in  the  subgroup  of 
paediatric patients. 
Assessment of results referred to adult patients is out of the scope of this submission.  
Safety results 
The aim of Study 117 was to evaluate treatment patterns, effectiveness and initiation experience. No 
safety data have been provided, apart from frequencies of discontinuations due to AEs (please refer to 
previous sections.) 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The  MAH  states  that  According  to  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006  of  the  European 
Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006, information on a paediatric study, a Multicenter, 
Retrospective,  Real-World,  Observational  Study  on  Orkambi  Use,  completed  on  20  October  2017  is 
being  submitted.  The  study  included  30  paediatric  subjects  (≥12  to  <18  years  old)  out  of  218  total 
subjects  enrolled.  The  submission  was  received  on  19  November  2019,  thus  not  within  6  months  of 
study  completion,  and  therefore  not  in  accordance  with  the  regulation,  that  requires  submission  of 
study results within 6 months of study completion. Therefore, the PAM is not fulfilled.  
The study was conducted at 8 US academic-based centres. Paediatric patients (n=30) were enrolled in 
four of the participating US sites.

Study  117  was  designed  to  explore  retrospective  data  from  patients’  medical  records  to  assess  real-
world  Orkambi  initiation  experience  during  July  2015  to  December  2015  following  the  approval  in  CF 
F/F patients aged 12 years and older in the United States. The outcomes that were evaluated included 
treatment  patterns  (e.g.,  Orkambi  discontinuation),  demographic  characteristics,  resource  utilization, 
and descriptive 12-month effectiveness. 
Qualified staff at each site identified the medical records of all patients who were prescribed Orkambi 
at  their  site  and  met  the  eligibility  criteria.  Eligible  patients  had  the  date  of  their  first  filled  Orkambi 
prescription (referred to hereafter as the “index date”) within the case ascertainment period of 01 July 
2015  through  31  December  2015.  Within  the  6-month  case  ascertainment  period,  patients  were 
divided into the following 2 initiation cohorts, solely by Orkambi initiation date: 
• Early initiators: index date between 01 July 2015 and 30 September 2015 
• Late initiators: index date between 01 October 2015 and 31 December 2015 
The analysis period for each patient consists of a pre-index period of at least 12 months and a post-
index period of at least 12 months. 
A total of 218 patients who met all eligibility criteria were included in the study (N= 131 early and N= 
87 late patients initiators), therefore a balanced representation of cases within the two groups was not 
fully achieved. The MAH identified in the market access (most patients received ORKAMBI within the 
first three months post-market uptake vs. three to six months post-market uptake) the main reason of 
having a lower number of available late-initiators patients as compared to early-initiators.  
Orkambi was prescribed by each patient’s physician in accordance with the US Prescribing Information 
(USPI) and as part of routine clinical care. Per the Orkambi US and EU Product Information, the dosing 
regimen  for  CF  patients  who  are  homozygous  for  F508del  and  aged  12  years  and  older  is  2  tablets 
(each containing LUM 200 mg/IVA 125 mg) taken orally every 12 hours (q12h). 
The analyses were only descriptive, in line with the study objectives.  
Out of 218 patients enrolled in Study 117, only 30 (13.8%) were paediatric patients 12-<18 years of 
age), including 17 (13%) early initiation patients and 13 (14.9%) late initiation patients. The focus of 
this submission is providing data on real-world use and effectiveness of ORKAMBI in CF F/F patients in 
the US who were 12 years or older.  
For this reason, an assessment of results for the whole study population, as submitted by the MAH, is 
out of the scope of this AR. In the initial submission, only data on drug utilization have been provided 
for  the  paediatric  subgroup  (30  subjects):  1) the  great  majority  (27  subjects,  90%)  received  the  full 
dose (2 tablets twice a day) and 3 subjects (10%) received half dose (1 tablet twice a day) within 12–
months post Orkambi initiation. All three subjects who re-initiated after first discontinuation, received 
the  full  dose.  2)  only  a  minority  of  subjects  (4  paediatric  subjects  at  least  one  dose  increased;  2 
subjects  at  least  one  dose  decreased  and  2  subjects  at  least  one  Orkambi  dose  interruption) 
experienced  dose  adjustments  Therefore,  the  great  majority  of  pediatric  patients  received  the  full 
dose.  
The  MAH  was  requested  to  provide  baseline  clinical  characteristics  and  descriptive  results  regarding 
Orkambi effectiveness in the subgroup of paediatric patients. 
In  the  subgroup  of  paediatric  patients,  the  mean  (SD)  age  at  the  index  date  was  14.4  (1.80)  years, 
mean  (SD)  weight  was  47.0  (10.61)  kg,  mean  (SD)  height  was  156.00  (11.00)  cm,  mean  (SD)  BMI 
was 19.1 (2.67) kg/m2, with no relevant differences between early and late initiators. The proportion 
of  male  patients  was  43.3%  (early  initiators:  47.1%;  late  initiators:  38.5%).  The  most  commonly 
reported  CF  comorbid  conditions  during  the  pre-index  period  or  ongoing  at  index  date  were  chronic

sinusitis  and  asthma,  followed  by  CF  related  diabetes.  However,  the  interpretation  of  these  data  is 
limited, as most baseline comorbid conditions were categorized as “Others” (16/30, 53%). The mean 
(SD)  ppFEV1  was  89.5  (20.51)  percentage  points  (early  initiators:  84.8  [SD:  23.80]  percentage 
points; late initiators: 95.2 [14.42] percentage points). The proportion of paediatric patients with PEx 
was  16.7%  (early  initiators:  23.5%;  late  initiators:  7.7%).  The  proportion  of  paediatric  patients 
treated with IV antibiotics was 6.7% (early initiators:11.8%; late initiators: 0.0%) and the proportion 
of paediatric patients with CF-related inpatient hospitalizations was 6.7% (early initiators: 11.8%; late 
initiators: 0.0%). 
Descriptive results regarding Orkambi effectiveness in the subgroup of paediatric patients 12 through 
17 years of age from Study 117 present limitations and should be interpreted with caution due to the 
low  number  of  paediatric  subjects  aged  12-17  years  enrolled  (N=30,  among  them  N=17  ‘early 
initiators’ and N=13 ‘late initiators’), the retrospective data collection from patient medical records and 
the exploratory nature of the study. 
A  numerical  decrease  in  ppFEV1  was  observed  in  the  paediatric  subgroup  [-2.9  percentage  points 
(95%  CI:  -9.1,  3.4)]  from  baseline  to  the  last  available  assessment  within  the  12-month  post-index 
period.  This  rate  of  decrease  is  similar  to  the  annualized  rate  of  lung  function  decline  reported  in  a 
published  analysis  of  US  Cystic  Fibrosis  Foundation  (CFF)  registry  data  in  patients  homozygous  for 
F508del,  aged  13  through  17  years,  untreated  with  a  CFTR  modulator  (-2.66  percentage  points  per 
year;  Wegener  et  al,  J  Cyst  Fibros.  2018;17(4):503-10).  However,  given  the  small  sample  size  of 
Study 117 paediatric subgroup and the wide CI that crosses 0, no conclusions can be made regarding 
the effect of Orkambi treatment on ppFEV1 in this subgroup. 
In the larger, ongoing comparator-controlled PASS, a reduction in the rate of lung function decline was 
observed  over  4  years  in  the  subgroup  of  Orkambi-treated  patients  12  through  17  years  of  age, 
compared to an untreated cohort. 
The paediatric subgroup analysis of 30 patients from Study 117 showed improvements in BMI [mean 
change from baseline: 1.1 kg/m2 (95% CI: 0.6, 1.6)] and weight [mean change from baseline 4.4 kg 
(95% CI: 3.3, 5.6)]. 
No  major  differences,  although  with  numerical  slight  decreases,  were  observed  in  the  paediatric 
subgroup between pre-index period and post index period for: annualized PEx rate [1.1 (SD 1.52) vs 
0.9 (SD1.01)], rate of hospitalizations [1.2 (2.17) vs 0.8 (1.19)], outpatient visits [6.0 (4.62) vs 5.4 
(2.81)],  acute  antibiotic  prescriptions  [3.4  (4.03)  vs  3.1  (5.01)],  and  the  proportion  of  patients  with 
positive  P.  aeruginosa  after  Orkambi  initiation  (56.7%  vs  50%).  There  were  no  lung  transplants  or 
deaths in the paediatric subgroup. 
Furthermore,  the  MAH  was  requested  to  discuss  the  high  frequency  of  Orkambi  discontinuation 
observed  in  the  subgroup of  paediatric  subjects  (8/30,  26.7%)  and  to  provide  further  information  on 
the reasons for discontinuation in the 4 subjects where the reported reason was “other AE” and in the 
2 subjects classified as “other reason”. Of the 8 paediatric patients who discontinued Orkambi after the 
first  initiation  of  treatment,  3  reinitiated  Orkambi:  two  of  these  3  patients  remained  on  treatment 
through  the  end  of  the  study;  1  subject  discontinued  after  the  second  initiation  of  treatment.  Thus, 
6/30  paediatric  patients  (20%)  permanently  discontinued  treatment  in  Study  117.  This  frequency  of 
discontinuation is higher than the one observed in the same age range in pivotal clinical trials (1.0%, 
3/290 subjects), and in another observational study conducted in France (8.2%) (Burgel et al, 2019). 
As regards to the types of AEs observed, the events were mostly known ADRs (2 subjects discontinued 
due  to  transaminase  increase;  one  subject  each discontinued due to headaches  and  rash).  The other 
two subjects presented exacerbation of reflux symptoms leading to discontinuation and fever one hour 
after dose and rhinorrhea (1 patient each).

Page 36/78 
 
 
 
Also, in the overall population enrolled in Study 117, a high frequency of discontinuation (35.8%) was 
observed. The most frequent reason for study discontinuation was respiratory AEs (39 subjects, 52% 
of subjects who discontinued). The frequency of discontinuation observed in Study 117 is considerably 
higher  than  the  frequency  of  AEs  leading  to  treatment  discontinuation    observed  in  the  overall 
population  enrolled  in  the  pooled  placebo-controlled  Phase  3  studies  (pivotal  Studies  103  and  104) 
(4.6%),  as  well  as  in  the  long  term  extension  of  pivotal  studies  up  to  96  weeks  treatment  duration 
(6.8%).  
In  the  observational  study  conducted  in  France  to  evaluate  real-world  treatment  effects  of  Orkambi 
over  the  first  year  of  treatment  previously  cited  (Burgel  et  al,  2019),  the  overall  study  rates  of 
Orkambi discontinuation in adults was 23.5%. 
The  MAH  was  requested  to  discuss  the  high  frequency  of  discontinuation  (35.8%)  and  to  discuss  all 
available data on the reasons for discontinuations observed in the adult population of patients enrolled 
in Study 117. The reasons for treatment discontinuation were respiratory AEs (39 patients [52.0%]), 
other  reason  (17  patients  [22.7%]),  other  AE  (9  patients  [12.0%]),  lack  of  effectiveness  (5  patients 
[6.7%]),  unknown  (3  patients  [4.0%]),  and  gastrointestinal  AE  (2  patients  [2.7%]).  Among  the  17 
patients that discontinued due to other reasons, most patients discontinued due to AEs. As regards to 
the types of AEs leading to discontinuation, the events were mostly known ADRs for Orkambi. Of note, 
one  patients  discontinued  due  to  worsened  depression  and  one  patient  discontinued  due  to  Stevens 
Johnson’s syndrome. 
It  is  acknowledged  that  the  data  from  the  PASS  study,  given  the  larger  sample  size  and  longer 
duration, may be considered more representative of the real-world Orkambi experience. In the annual 
interim analysis results from the larger, registry-based, 5-year post-authorization safety study (PASS) 
Study 108,  the proportion of patients in the Orkambi Safety Cohort who had no record of Orkambi use 
in the subsequent calendar year suggests a discontinuation rate of 10.1% for the 2016 Orkambi Safety 
Cohort (N= 5,553) and 12.2% for the 2017 Orkambi Safety Cohort (N = 6,664).  
In the overall study population, seven patients (3.2%) required at least one transplant after ORKAMBI 
initiation  (all  seven  were  lung  transplants),  of  which  6  patients  were  early-initiators,  compared  to  no 
patients  requiring  transplant  prior  to  Orkambi  initiation  and  2  patients  with  unknown  prior  transplant 
before  Orkambi  initiation.  There  were  2  (0.9%)  deaths  observed  during  the  post-index  period,  1  of 
which  occurred  while  on  Orkambi  treatment  with  unknown  cause.  The  MAH  has  been  requested  to 
provide  all  available  information  (including  age)  of  the  7  subjects  requiring  lung  transplant  after 
Orkambi initiation and of the 2 deaths observed during the post index period. 
The age at the time that Orkambi was prescribed for the 7 patients who had a lung transplant ranged 
from 23 to 56 years of age. The 2 patients who died during the post-index period were aged 20 and 52 
years  old.  The  MAH  clarified  that  no  further  information  is  available  on  these  patients,  given  that  for 
death  and  organ  transplant,  there  was  no  option  in  the  CRFs  for  the  sites  to  provide  any  additional 
description regarding these events. 
In Study 117, a higher proportion of patients (3.2%) required lung transplant after Orkambi initiation 
in  comparison  to  the  proportion  of  patients  with  a  history  of  any  organ  transplant  (0.4%)  in  the 
Orkambi  Safety  Cohort  in  2018  in  PASS  Study  108.  It  is  acknowledged  that  the  data  from  the  PASS 
study, given the larger sample size and longer duration, may be considered more representative of the 
real-world Orkambi experience. In the third interm analysis of the ongoing PASS, consistently with the 
previous 2 interim reports, the risk of death and organ transplant was statistically significantly lower in 
the Orkambi Cohort compared to the Comparator Cohort.

3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
On 19 November 2019, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Orkambi. Study Title: “A 
Multicenter,  Retrospective,  Real-World,  Observational  Study  on  Orkambi  Use”.  The  study  included  30 
paediatric subjects (≥12 years old). The study was completed on 20 October 2017, thus not within 6 
months of study completion. This is not in accordance with the regulation (Article 46 of Regulation (EC) 
No1901/2006,  as  amended).  Therefore,  the  PAM  is  not  considered  to  be  fulfilled  as  it  was  not 
submitted within the legal timelines (i.e. within six months of completion of each study). 
The  focus  of  this  submission  is  providing  data  on  real-world  use  and  descriptive  effectiveness  of 
ORKAMBI in CF F/F patients in the US who were 12 years or older. For this reason, the assessment of 
results for the whole study population, as submitted by the MAH, is out of the scope of this AR. Data 
on drug utilization have been provided for the paediatric cohort (30 subjects) indicating that the great 
majority of subjects (90%) received the full Orkambi dose.  
Descriptive results regarding Orkambi effectiveness in the subgroup of paediatric patients 12 through 
17 years of age from Study 117 present limitations and should be interpreted with caution due to the 
low number of paediatric subjects aged 12-17 years enrolled (N=30), the retrospective data collection 
from patient medical records and the exploratory nature of the study.  
A more severe pattern of baseline disease characteristics was observed in early initiators as compared 
to late initiators. 
Results  seem  not  suggesting  a  positive  trend  on  ppFEV1.  However,  given  the  small  sample  size  of 
Study 117 paediatric subgroup and the wide CI that crosses 0, no conclusions can be made. Of note, 
supportive  results  of  Orkambi  effectiveness  on  ppFEV1  are  coming  from  the  larger,  ongoing 
comparator-controlled PASS. 
Increases in weight and BMI were observed in the paediatric subgroup between pre-index period and 
post index period. There were no major differences for the other variables/outcomes, slight numerical 
decreases were observed.  
A high frequency of discontinuation was observed in Study 117, both in the overall population (35.8%) 
and in the subgroup of paediatric subjects (8/30, 26.7%).  
However, the types of AEs leading to discontinuation were mostly known ADRs for Orkambi.  
In order to allow to contextualize the higher frequency of treatment discontinuation observed in Study 
117 in adolescents 12 through 17 years of age, compared to the one observed in the same age range 
in  pivotal  clinical  trials,  the  MAH  was  requested  to  provide  baseline  disease  characteristics  of  the 
subgroup  of  30  paediatric  subjects  included  in  Study  117  in  comparison  with  baseline  clinical 
characteristics  of  adolescents  12  through  17  years  of  age,  enrolled  in  the  pooled  placebo-controlled 
Phase  3  studies  (pivotal  Studies  103  and  104).  It  is  of  note  that  ppFEV1  value  of  patients  12  to  17 
years of age enrolled in Study 117 is higher (mean 89.5, SD 20.51) in comparison to patients of the 
same age range enrolled in pivotal studies 103/104 (mean 67.3, SD 13.0) underlying a quite different 
lung function as measured by ppFEV1 at baseline surely limiting indirect comparability of study results 
but possibly not substantially contributing to a higher treatment discontinuation observed in Study 117 
study.  
7 subjects required lung transplant after Orkambi initiation and two 2 deaths were observed during the 
post index period. It is noted that a higher proportion of patients (3.2%) required lung transplant after 
Orkambi  initiation  in  comparison  to  the  proportion  of  patients  with  a  history  of  any  organ  transplant 
(0.4%) in the Orkambi Safety Cohort in 2018 in PASS Study 108. No details on CRF were available.  It

3.  Unexpectedly, only data on drug utilization have been provided for the paediatric subgroup (30 
subjects). To allow the assessment of study 117 results, the MAH is required to submit  
i) 
ii) 
the distribution of paediatric patients (i.e, number eligible and enrolled) across sites;  
comprehensive baseline clinical characteristics of the overall paediatric population and 
by initiation cohort;  
iii) 
descriptive  results  regarding  Orkambi  effectiveness  in  the  subgroup  of  paediatric 
patients for the following variables: Clinical outcomes (BMI, ppFEV1, weight, and PEx),

Question 3 
Unexpectedly, only data on drug utilization have been provided for the paediatric subgroup (30 
subjects). To allow the assessment of study 117 results, the MAH is required to submit 
i) the distribution of paediatric patients (i.e., number eligible and enrolled) across sites; 
ii) comprehensive baseline clinical characteristics of the overall paediatric population and by initiation 
cohort; 
iii) descriptive results regarding Orkambi effectiveness in the subgroup of paediatric patients for the 
following variables: clinical outcomes (BMI, ppFEV1, weight, and PEx), Healthcare resource utilization 
(Inpatient hospitalizations; Outpatient visit, Acute antibiotic use including IV antibiotic, Other CF 
medications use); Other Outcomes [Microbiology: (e.g., Pseudomonas); Death; Transplantation]. 
MAH’s Response: 
Study 117 was an exploratory, retrospective chart study designed to explore the real-world utilization 
and treatment patterns in the indicated population for Orkambi in the months following the initial 
approval in the US. The indicated population, and those enrolled in the study, included cystic fibrosis 
(CF) patients homozygous for F508del who were 12 through 17 years of age. The study was not 
designed to evaluate the paediatric subgroup; therefore, subgroup analyses of these patients are not 
considered informative or appropriate. 
Post hoc subgroup analyses of the paediatric population enrolled in Study 117 would not be informative 
or appropriate because: 
1) this was an exploratory study using medical records abstraction; 
2) the subgroup is not powered to detect changes in the requested endpoints; and 
3) because the study was not designed or powered to assess this paediatric subgroup, there is a high 
likelihood of confounding from imbalanced baseline characteristics between the even smaller 
subgroups of early and late initiators. 
For these reasons, analyses of the paediatric subgroup would have a high likelihood of not being 
representative of CF patients 12 through 17 years of age initiating Orkambi and would not be 
interpretable. In summary, the requested subgroup analyses are not considered appropriate for this 
study. 
Assessment of the MAH’s Response 
The  focus  of  this  study  is  providing  data  on  real-world  use  and  effectiveness  of  ORKAMBI  in  CF  F/F 
patients in the US including adults and patients who were 12-17 years old. Of 218 patients enrolled in 
Study  117,  30  (13.8%)  were  paediatric  patients  12-<18  years  of  age),  including  17  (13%)  early 
initiation  patients  and  13  (14.9%)  late  initiation  patients.  Only  data  on  drug  utilization  have  been

provided  for  the  paediatric  subgroup  (30  subjects).  Baseline  data  and  post-hoc  analyses  on  pediatric 
patients (12-17 years old) were required however the MAH did not provide these analyses since were 
not  considered  to  be  informative  or  appropriate  for  the  following  reasons:  i)  the  study  design  was 
exploratory and medical records were used, ii) the study is not powered for the subgroup analysis and 
data from a small subgroup would be not interpretable.  
It  is  acknowledged  that  the  study  is  exploratory  and  retrospective  and  that  the  main  aim  was  to 
explore  the  real-world  utilization  and  treatment  patterns  of  Orkambi  in  F/F  CF  patients  ≥12  years  in 
the US, however the requested data could have been an opportunity to gain some information on the 
subgroup,  although  limited,  of  pediatric  patients  included  in  the  study.  However,  due  to  the  limited 
number of patients and lack of complete baseline data, it is recognised that the results would not be 
sufficiently informative to allow inclusion of relevant information in the SmPC.  
Not further pursued.  
MS comments 
Reportedly, the main objective of this retrospective observational study was to «explore real-world use 
and effectiveness of ORKAMBI in CF F/F patients in the US who were 12 years of age or older». It is 
agreed that a low number of paediatric subjects aged 12-17 years was enrolled (N=30, among them 
N=17  ‘early  initiators’  and  N=13  ‘late  initiators’)  and  that  the  retrospective  data  collection  and 
exploratory character of the investigation undoubtedly result in limitations. 
However,  the  analyses  presented  by  the  MAH  for  the  paediatric  population  are  scarce,  cursory,  and 
mainly limited to drug usage data. It appears that effectiveness and safety data were collected, but not 
even descriptively analysed, let alone comprehensively evaluated. In the absence of such a descriptive 
analysis, the MAH’s overall conclusion that the «results would not be sufficiently informative [anyway]» 
is an assumption which is not sufficiently corroborated by facts. 
Additional comment in relation with the paediatric drug usage data: based on the tables presented in 
the  AR,  it  appears  that  Orkambi  treatment  was  discontinued  in  8/30  children  (26.7%)  following  first 
initiation, and not – as erroneously mentioned in the AR – in 4/30 children (13.3%). In the majority of 
cases (6 out of 8), Orkambi was discontinued within four months of treatment initiation. Moreover, the 
underlying  reasons  were  not  sufficiently  specified  or  made  transparent  by  the  MAH:  N=4  other  AE, 
N=2 other reason. 
Additional clarification requested (2nd RSI) 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this procedure  
1.  It  is  acknowledged  that  a  low  number  of  paediatric  subjects  aged  12-17  years  was  enrolled 
(N=30) and that the retrospective data collection and exploratory character of the investigation 
undoubtedly result in limitations. However, given that some effectiveness and safety data were 
collected,  in  the  absence  of  a  descriptive  analysis,  the  MAH’s  overall  conclusion  that  the 
«results  would  not  be  sufficiently  informative  [anyway]»  is  an  assumption  which  is  not 
sufficiently  corroborated  by  facts.  To  allow  the  assessment  of  study  117  results,  the  MAH  is 
required to submit  
i) 
ii) 
the distribution of paediatric patients (i.e, number eligible and enrolled) across sites;  
comprehensive baseline clinical characteristics of the overall paediatric population and 
by initiation cohort;

iii) 
descriptive  results  regarding  Orkambi  effectiveness  in  the  subgroup  of  paediatric 
patients for the following variables: Clinical outcomes (BMI, ppFEV1, weight, and PEx), 
Healthcare  resource  utilization  (Inpatient  hospitalizations;  Outpatient  visits,  Acute

2.  Orkambi  treatment  was  discontinued  in  8/30  children  (26.7%)  following  first  initiation.  In  the 
majority  of  cases  (6  out  of  8),  Orkambi  was  discontinued  within  four  months  of  treatment  initiation. 
The  underlying  reasons  were  the  following:  N=4  other  AE,  N=2  other  reason,  lack  of  effectiveness  1 
patient, Gastrointestinal AE 1 patient. The Applicant should provide further information on the reasons 
for discontinuation in the 4 subjects where the reported reason was “other AE” and in the 2 subjects 
classified  as  “other  reason”.  The  Applicant  should  discuss  the  high  frequency  of  Orkambi 
discontinuation observed in this study.

antibiotic  use  including  IV  antibiotic,  Other  CF  medications  use);  Other  Outcomes 
[Microbiology: (e.g., Pseudomonas); Death; Transplantation]. 
MAH’s Response: 
In  line  with  EMA  guidance,  the  outcome  of  an  Article  46  procedure  assessed  by  the  EMA  is  to 
determine  whether  an  update  to  the  SmPC  is  warranted  or  not.  Vertex  is  in  agreement  with  the 
Rapporteur’s  assessment  that  “due  to  the  limited  number  of  patients  and  lack  of  complete  baseline 
data, it is recognised that the results would not be sufficiently informative to allow inclusion of relevant 
information in the SmPC.” 
Vertex acknowledges the request for additional analyses, but respectfully declines this request for the 
following reasons. Study 117 was an exploratory retrospective study that was not designed or powered 
to  assess  the  paediatric  subgroup  for  the  requested  endpoints.  While  some  data  relating  to  the 
utilization patterns of Orkambi were collected, the data were very limited. 
Limitations for the requested subgroup analyses include: 
• this was an exploratory, retrospective chart study using medical records abstraction 
• the paediatric subgroup is not powered to detect changes in the requested endpoints

• the small paediatric subgroup would have a high likelihood of not being representative of CF patients 
12 through 17 years of age 
•  due  to  the  small  size  of  the  paediatric  subgroup,  there  is  a  high  likelihood  of  imbalanced  baseline 
characteristics  between  the  early  and  late  initiator  groups.  As  a  result,  the  requested  analyses  for 
baseline characteristics by initiation cohort would not provide representative data for this age group. 
•  the  large  number  of  variables  that  would  be  analyzed  for  the  requested  subgroup  analyses  would 
lead to a high chance of misleading findings 
For  these  reasons,  the  requested  subgroup  analyses  would  not  be  representative  of  CF  patients  12 
through 17 years of age and are not considered appropriate for this study. 
Study  117  was  an  exploratory  study  designed  to  explore  the  early  treatment  patterns  following  the 
initial  US  approval.  In  the  Orkambi  clinical  development  program,  Vertex  has  evaluated  Orkambi  in 
paediatric  patients  in  larger  and  more  comprehensive  studies,  such  as  placebo-controlled  Phase  3 
studies  (Studies  VX12-809-103,  VX12-809-104,  and  VX14-809-109),  open-label  long-term  safety 
studies  (Study  VX12-809-105  and  Study  VX15-809-110  [Study  110]),  and  an  observational  post-
authorization study (Study VX14-809-108); the data from these studies better represent the paediatric 
experience  with  Orkambi.  The  analysis  of  this  small  subgroup  would  not  be  likely  to  change  the 
positive benefit:risk profile in CF patients12 through 17 years of age. 
Assessment of the MAH’s Response: 
Despite  the  repeated  requests  to  provide  descriptive  results  regarding  Orkambi  effectiveness  in  the 
subgroup  of  30  paediatric  patients  included  in  Study  117  (first  request  by  e-mail  prior  to  first 
assessment report, second request through 1st RSI, third request following DE comments through 2nd 
RSI) the MAH has not provided the requested data on the basis of the argumentation that Study 117 
was  an  exploratory  retrospective  study,  that  was  not  designed  or  powered  to  assess  the  paediatric 
subgroup for the requested endpoints. While some data relating to the utilization patterns of Orkambi 
were  collected,  the  data  were  very  limited  and  the  MAH’s  opinion  is  that  the  analysis  of  this  small 
subgroup  would  not  be  likely  to  change  the  positive  benefit/risk  profile  in  CF  patients  12  through  17 
years of age. 
The MAH refusal to provide the requested data is difficult to understand.  
Even  though  it  is  acknowledged  that  a  low  number  of  paediatric  subjects  aged  12  -  17  years  was 
enrolled  (N=30)  and  that  the  retrospective  data  collection  and  exploratory  character  of  the 
investigation  undoubtedly  result  in  limitations,  as  previously  commented  by  DE,  given  that  some 
effectiveness data were collected, in the absence of a descriptive analysis, the MAH’s overall conclusion 
that “the analysis of this small subgroup would not be likely to change the positive benefit:risk profile 
in CF patients 12 through 17 years of age” is an assumption which is not sufficiently corroborated by 
data. 
Thus, the request to provide the following data is reiterated: 
i) 
ii) 
the distribution of paediatric patients (i.e, number eligible and enrolled) across sites;  
comprehensive  baseline  clinical  characteristics  of  the  overall  paediatric  population  and  by 
initiation cohort;  
iii) 
descriptive  results  regarding  Orkambi  effectiveness  in  the  subgroup  of  paediatric  patients  for 
the  following  variables:  Clinical  outcomes  (BMI,  ppFEV1,  weight,  and  PEx),  Healthcare  resource 
utilization  (Inpatient  hospitalizations;  Outpatient  visits,  Acute  antibiotic  use  including  IV  antibiotic,

Other  CF  medications  use);  Other  Outcomes  [Microbiology:  (e.g.,  Pseudomonas);  Death; 
Transplantation] 
Question 2 
Orkambi treatment was discontinued in 8/30 children (26.7%) following first initiation. In the majority 
of  cases  (6  out  of  8),  Orkambi  was  discontinued  within  four  months  of  treatment  initiation.  The 
underlying  reasons  were  the  following:  N=4  other  AE,  N=2  other  reason,  lack  of  effectiveness  1 
patient, Gastrointestinal AE 1 patient. The Applicant should provide further information on the reasons 
for discontinuation in the 4 subjects where the reported reason was “other AE” and in the 2 subjects 
classified  as  “other  reason”.  The  Applicant  should  discuss  the  high  frequency  of  Orkambi 
discontinuation observed in this study.   
MAH’s Response: 
As  requested,  additional  information  is  provided  in  Table  1  for  the  8  paediatric  patients  who 
discontinued after first initiation, including the patients where the reported reason for discontinuation 
was “other AE” (n = 4) or “other reason” (n = 2). The case report forms (CRFs) included an option for 
the sites to enter free text to specify the reasons for discontinuation; the free text is provided verbatim 
from the CRF in Table 15. 
Table 15: Reason for discontinuation for pediatric patients  
With  respect  to  the  frequency  of  discontinuation,  Vertex  would  like  to  clarify  that  of  the  8  paediatric 
patients who discontinued Orkambi after the first initiation of treatment, 3 reinitiated Orkambi (Study 
117  CSR/Table  44).  Two  of  these  3  patients  remained  on  treatment  through  the  end  of  the  study;  1 
subject discontinued after the second initiation of treatment (see Patient 5 from Table 1). Thus, only 6 
paediatric patients discontinued treatment in Study 117. 
Furthermore,  as  discussed  in  the  response  to  Question  1,  Study  117  was  conducted  early  in  the 
Orkambi  lifecycle.  In  the  last  5  years,  other  larger  studies  have  shown  lower  discontinuation  rates  in 
paediatric patients than that observed in Study 117. In an observational study conducted in France to 
evaluate  real-world  treatment  effects  of  Orkambi,  the  overall  discontinuation  rate  for  adolescents  12 
through 17 years of age was 8.2% (n = 292).1 In addition, several Vertex clinical studies in paediatric 
subjects  have  shown  that  Orkambi  is  well  tolerated with  lower  rates  of  discontinuation.  For  example, 
the  overall  discontinuation  rate  in  paediatric  subjects  who  initiated  Orkambi  treatment  between  6 
through  11  years  of  age  (Study  110)  was  10.0%  (n  =  239),  with  AEs  leading  to  treatment

discontinuation  in  only  3.8%  of  subjects.  Taken  together,  these  studies  indicate  that  the 
discontinuation  rate  observed  in  Study  117  is  not  representative  of  real-world  or  clinical  experience 
with Orkambi to date.

Assessment of the MAH’s Response: 
The MAH provided the requested data for the 8/30 paediatric patients who discontinued Orkambi after 
first initiation. 
Two  subjects  (2/30,  6.7%)  discontinued  due  to  lack  of  effectiveness/lack  of  perceived  therapeutic 
effect; one subject (1/30, 3.3%) discontinued due to inability to swallow the tablets, and 6/30 subjects 
(20%)  discontinued  due  to  AEs.  Among  the  6  subjects  discontinuing  due  to  AEs,  the  AEs  leading  to 
discontinuation were the following (verbatim text): increase in transaminase (2 patients), exacerbation 
of reflux symptoms, headaches, rash, fevers one hour after dose and rhinorrhea (1 patient each). 
Of  the  8  paediatric  patients  who  discontinued  Orkambi  after  the  first  initiation  of  treatment,  3 
reinitiated  Orkambi:  two  of  these  3  patients  remained  on  treatment  through  the  end  of  the  study;  1 
subject  discontinued  after  the  second  initiation  of  treatment  (this  patient  discontinued  after  the  first 
initiation  of  treatment  due  to:  “Headaches”.  Then,  the  patient  subsequently  discontinued  after 
reinitiation  of  treatment  due  to  “increases  in  transaminases”).  Thus,  6/30  paediatric  patients  (20%) 
permanently discontinued treatment in Study 117. 
The MAH states other larger studies have shown lower discontinuation rates in paediatric patients than 
that  observed  in  Study  117:  in  an  observational  study  conducted  in  France  to  evaluate  real-world 
treatment  effects  of  Orkambi  over  the  first  year  of  treatment,  the  overall  discontinuation  rate  for 
adolescents 12 through 17 years of age was 8.2% (n = 292); conversely in this study rates of Orkambi 
discontinuation  were  significantly  higher  in  adults  than  in  adolescents  (23.5%  vs  8.2%,  p<  0.0001) 
(Burgel et al, 2019). Thus, in the MAH’s opinion, the discontinuation rate observed in Study 117 is not 
representative of real-world or clinical experience with Orkambi to date. 
Of the 1108 subjects who received study drug in the pooled placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies (pivotal 
Studies 103 and 104), 290 subjects were aged ≥12 to <18 years of age. Among subjects ≥12 to <18 
years  of  age,  3  subjects  (1.0%)  discontinued  due  to  an  adverse  event  during  the  6  months  study 
duration: 2 subjects on placebo (acne, n =1; haemoptysis, n = 1) and 1 subject in the LUM 400 mg 
q12h/IVA 250 mg q12h group (forced expiratory volume decrease).  
In  the  overall  pooled  placebo-controlled  Phase  3  studies,  the  incidence  of  adverse  events  leading  to 
study drug discontinuation was higher in the total LUM/IVA group (4.2%) compared with the placebo 
group (1.6%). 
In study 105 A, the long-term extension of pivotal studies up to 96 weeks treatment duration, a total 
of 70 (6.8%) subjects had AEs that led to treatment discontinuation. 
In  the  adult  population  enrolled  in  Study  117,  67/188  subjects  (35.8%)  discontinued  due  to  any 
reason. The most frequent reason for study discontinuation was respiratory AEs (39 subjects, 58.2% of 
subjects who discontinued). 
Conclusion:  
6/30 adolescents 12 through 17 years of age (20%) permanently discontinued treatment in Study 117. 
This  frequency  of  discontinuation  is  higher  than  the  one  observed  in  the  same  age  range  in  pivotal 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

clinical trials (1.0%, 3/290 subjects), and in another observational study conducted in France (8.2%) 
(Burgel et la, 2019).  
As regards to the types of AEs observed, the events were mostly known ADRs (2 subjects discontinued 
due  to  transaminase  increase;  one  subject  each discontinued due to headaches  and  rash).  The other 
two  subjects  presented  exacerbation  of  reflux  symptoms  leading  to  discontinuation  and  fevers  one 
hour after dose and rhinorrhea (1 patient each). 
In order to better contextualize the higher frequency of treatment discontinuation (20%) observed in 
Study 117 in adolescents 12 through 17 years of age, compared to the one observed in the same age 
range in pivotal clinical trials (1.0%, 3/290 subjects), baseline clinical characteristics of the subgroup 
of 30 pediatric subjects included in Study 117 are needed (please refer to assessment of question 2 for 
further aspects on this issue). Baseline clinical characteristics of the subgroup of 30 paediatric subjects 
included  in  Study  117  should  be  discussed  by  the  MAH  in  comparison  with  baseline  clinical 
characteristics  of  adolescents  12  through  17  years  of  age,  enrolled  in  the  pooled  placebo-controlled 
Phase 3 studies (pivotal Studies 103 and 104). 
The  MAH  is  requested  to  discuss  the  high  frequency  of  discontinuation  (35.8%)  and  to  discuss  all 
available data on the reasons for discontinuations observed in the adult population of patients enrolled 
in Study 117. 
In the overall study population, seven patients (3.2%) required at least one transplant after ORKAMBI 
initiation  (all  seven  were  lung  transplants),  of  which  6  patients  were  early-initiators,  compared  to  no 
patients  requiring  transplant  prior  to  Orkambi  initiation  and  2  patients  with  unknown  prior  transplant 
before  Orkambi  initiation.  There  were  2  (0.9%)  deaths  observed  during  the  post-index  period,  1  of 
which  occurred  while  on  Orkambi  treatment  with  unknown  cause.  The  MAH  has  been  requested  to 
provide  all  available  information  (including  age)  of  the  7  subjects  requiring  lung  transplant  after 
Orkambi initiation and of the 2 deaths observed during the post index period. 
The higher proportion of patients requiring at least one organ transplantation after Orkambi initiation 
in Study 117 (3.2%) in comparison to the proportion of patients with a history of any organ transplant 
(0.4%) in the Orkambi Safety Cohort in 2018 in PASS Study 108 should be discussed.  
Additional clarification requested (3rd RSI) 
The argumentations provided by the MAH are not agreed. 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this procedure  
1.  It is acknowledged that a  low number of paediatric subjects aged 12 - 17 years was enrolled 
(N=30) and that the retrospective data collection and exploratory character of the investigation 
undoubtedly result in limitations. However, given that some effectiveness and safety data were 
collected,  in  the  absence  of  a  descriptive  analysis,  the  MAH’s  overall  conclusion  that  the  “the 
analysis of this small subgroup would not be likely to change the positive benefit:risk profile in 
CF  patients  12  through  17  years  of  age”    is  an  assumption  which  is  not  sufficiently 
corroborated  by  data.  To  allow  the  assessment  of  study  117  results,  the  MAH  is  required  to 
submit  
vii) 
the distribution of paediatric patients (i.e., number eligible and enrolled) across sites;  
viii) 
comprehensive baseline clinical characteristics of the overall paediatric population and 
by initiation cohort;  
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/611137/2020

ix) 
descriptive  results  regarding  Orkambi  effectiveness  in  the  subgroup  of  paediatric 
patients for the following variables: Clinical outcomes (BMI, ppFEV1, weight, and PEx), 
Healthcare  resource  utilization  (Inpatient  hospitalizations;  Outpatient  visits,  Acute 
antibiotic  use  including  IV  antibiotic,  Other  CF  medications  use);  Other  Outcomes 
[Microbiology: (e.g., Pseudomonas); Death; Transplantation]. 
2.  In  order  to  allow  to  contextualize  the  higher  frequency  of  treatment  discontinuation  (20%) 
observed  in  Study  117  in  adolescents  12  through  17  years  of  age,  compared  to  the  one 
observed  in  the  same  age  range  in  pivotal  clinical  trials  (1.0%,  3/290  subjects),  baseline 
clinical  characteristics  of  the  subgroup  of  30  paediatric  subjects  included  in  Study  117  are 
needed.  Baseline  clinical  characteristics  of  the  subgroup  of  30  paediatric  subjects  included  in 
Study 117 should be discussed by the MAH in comparison with baseline clinical characteristics 
of  adolescents  12 through  17  years  of  age,  enrolled  in  the pooled placebo-controlled  Phase 3 
studies (pivotal Studies 103 and 104). 
3.  The MAH is requested to discuss the high frequency of discontinuation (35.8%) and to discuss 
available data on the reasons for discontinuations observed in the adult population of patients 
enrolled in Study 117. 
4.  The  MAH is  requested  to  provide  all  available  information  (including  age)  of  the  7  subjects 
requiring lung transplant after Orkambi initiation and of the 2 deaths observed during the post 
index  period.  The  higher  proportion  of  patients  requiring  at  least  one  organ  transplantation 
after Orkambi initiation in Study 117 (3.2%) in comparison to the proportion of patients with a 
history  of  any  organ  transplant  (0.4%)  in  the  Orkambi  Safety  Cohort  in  2018  in  PASS  Study 
108 should be discussed.  
MAH responses to 3rd Request for supplementary information 
Question 1 
It  is  acknowledged  that  a  low  number  of  paediatric  subjects  aged  12 -17  years  was  enrolled  (N=30) 
and  that  the  retrospective  data  collection  and  exploratory  character  of  the  investigation  undoubtedly 
result  in  limitations.  However,  given  that  some  effectiveness  and  safety  data  were  collected,  in  the 
absence  of  a  descriptive  analysis,  the  MAH’s  overall  conclusion  that  the  “the  analysis  of  this  small 
subgroup  would  not  be  likely  to  change  the  positive  benefit:risk  profile  in  CF  patients  12  through  17 
years of age”  is an assumption which is not sufficiently corroborated by data. To allow the assessment 
of study 117 results, the MAH is required to submit  
vii) 
the distribution of paediatric patients (i.e, number eligible and enrolled) across sites;  
viii) 
comprehensive baseline clinical characteristics of the overall paediatric population and 
by initiation cohort;  
x) 
descriptive  results  regarding  Orkambi  effectiveness  in  the  subgroup  of  paediatric 
patients for the following variables: Clinical outcomes (BMI, ppFEV1, weight, and PEx),

Summary of the MAH’s Responses 
After establishing the positive benefit-risk balance of Orkambi in F/F patients 12 years and older and 
receiving marketing approval for the adolescent and adult F/F population, Vertex conducted Study 117 
to explore the real-world utilization and treatment patterns over 12 months after Orkambi initiation in 
the  indicated  population  who  initiated  treatment  shortly  after  approval  of  Orkambi  in  the  US.  Data

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

were  extracted  from  medical  records  of  US  CF  subjects  only  and  are  subject  to  the  limitations  of 
uncontrolled observational real-world data, especially those of short duration. The subgroup analysis of 
paediatric subjects was not planned, as the number of subjects 12 through 17 years of age was small 
with significant limitations to interpretation of effectiveness outcomes. 
As requested, Vertex has conducted post-hoc subgroup analyses of the paediatric patients 12 through 
17  years  of  age  from  Study  117.  The  results  from  the  paediatric  subgroup  analyses  are  summarized 
below.  A  list  of  the  tables  summarizing  the  paediatric  subgroup  data  for  the  requested  endpoints  is 
provided in the Appendix. 
These  data  should  be  interpreted  with  caution  due  to  the  exploratory  nature  of  this  study  and  the 
limitations of the data collected via medical record abstraction. The study was conducted in the US only 
and  was  not  designed  or  powered  to  assess  the  paediatric  subgroup  for  the  requested  endpoints. 
Limitations in the retrospective data collection from patient medical records include incomplete/missing 
data and inconsistencies due to differences in medical chart documentation. 
Moreover, given the small sample size of 30 patients, it is not appropriate to infer that the results from 
the  requested  subgroup  analyses  are  generalizable  to  the  population  of  CF  patients  12  through  17 
years of age or that it would change the established positive benefit-risk of Orkambi.

iii. Orkambi Effectiveness Results 
Clinical outcomes 
ppFEV1  (Ad  Hoc  Table  3): The mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline to the last available 
assessment  within  the  12-month  post-index  period  was  -2.9  percentage  points  (95%  CI:  -9.1,  3.4). 
Given the small sample size and the wide CI that crosses 0, no conclusions can be made regarding the 
effect of Orkambi treatment on ppFEV1 in this subgroup.

MAH’s Summary 
The  paediatric  subgroup  analysis  of  30  patients  from  Study  117  showed  improvements  in  BMI  and 
weight, as well as a reduction in the annualized PEx rate, the rate of hospitalizations, outpatient visits, 
acute antibiotic prescriptions, and the proportion of patients with positive P. aeruginosa after Orkambi 
initiation. The rate of PEx, hospitalizations, outpatient visits, acute antibiotic prescriptions, and positive 
P.  aeruginosa  status  were  all  lower  in  the  paediatric  subgroup  than  in  the  overall  population.  There 
were no lung transplants or deaths in the paediatric subgroup. 
A  numerical  decrease  in  ppFEV1  was  observed  in  the  paediatric  subgroup,  which  can  be  expected  of 
this  age  group  and  the  natural  progression  of  the  disease.  These  results  should  be  interpreted  with 
caution given that the confidence intervals cross zero, the small sample size, the lack of a comparator 
control, and other limitations of this exploratory chart review study. In the larger, ongoing comparator-
controlled  PASS,  a  reduction  in  the  rate  of  lung  function  decline  was  observed  in  Orkambi-treated 
patients (n = 2,287) compared to untreated comparator patients (n = 3,527) across various age strata 
over a longer observational period. Specifically, in the subgroup of patients 12 through 17 years of age 
(n = 773), the decline in lung function change from the pre-treatment baseline was -3.84 percentage 
points versus -7.62 percentage points in the untreated comparator patients (n = 845). 
The overall positive benefit-risk balance of Orkambi in F/F patients, including the 12- through 17-year-
old age group, has been well established in pivotal and long-term clinical studies. Post-approval safety 
studies,  real  world  evidence  and  post-marketing  surveillance  data  continue  to  support  the  favourable 
efficacy and safety profile with Orkambi. 
Assessor’s comment 
The MAH provided the requested post-hoc subgroup analyses of the paediatric patients 12 through 17 
years of age from Study 117.  
Distribution  of  Paediatric  Patients  Enrolled  Across  Sites:  paediatric  patients  (n=30)  were 
enrolled in four of the eight participating US sites. 
Demographics  and  Baseline  Characteristics:  The  mean  (SD)  age  at  the  index  date  was  14.4 
(1.80) years, mean (SD) weight was 47.0 (10.61) kg, mean (SD) height was 156.00 (11.00) cm, mean 
(SD)  BMI  was  19.1  (2.67)  kg/m2,  with  no  relevant differences  between  early  and  late  initiators.  The 
proportion  of  male  patients  was  43.3%  (early  initiators:  47.1%;  late  initiators:  38.5%).  The  most 
commonly reported CF comorbid conditions during the pre-index period or ongoing at index date were 
chronic  sinusitis  and  asthma,  followed  by  CF  related  diabetes.  However,  the  interpretation  of  these 
data  is  limited,  as  most  baseline  comorbid  conditions  were  categorized  as  “Others”  (16/30,  53.3%). 
The  mean  (SD)  ppFEV1  was  89.5  (20.51)  percentage  points  (early  initiators:  84.8  [SD:  23.80] 
percentage  points;  late  initiators:  95.2  [14.42]  percentage  points).  The  proportion  of  paediatric 
patients  with  PEx  was  16.7%  (early  initiators:  23.5%;  late  initiators:  7.7%).  The  proportion  of 
paediatric patients treated with IV antibiotics was 6.7% (early initiators:11.8%; late initiators: 0.0%) 
and  the  proportion  of  paediatric  patients  with  CF-related  inpatient  hospitalizations  was  6.7%  (early 
initiators:  11.8%;  late  initiators:  0.0%),  supporting  a  more  severe  pattern  of  baseline  disease 
characteristics in early initiators as compared to late initiators. 
Effectiveness: The paediatric subgroup analysis of 30 patients from Study 117 showed improvements 
in BMI [mean change from baseline: 1.1 kg/m2 (95% CI: 0.6, 1.6)] and weight [mean change from 
baseline 4.4 kg (95% CI: 3.3, 5.6)].  
A numerical decrease in ppFEV1 was observed in the paediatric subgroup, the mean absolute change in 
ppFEV1  from  baseline  to  the  last  available  assessment  within  the  12-month post-index  period  was  -

2.9 percentage points (95% CI: -9.1, 3.4). The observed decrease is similar to the annualized rate of 
lung  function  decline  reported  in  a  published  analysis  of  US  Cystic  Fibrosis  Foundation  (CFF)  registry 
data  in  patients  homozygous  for  F508del,  aged  13  through  17  years,  not  treated  with  a  CFTR 
modulator  (-2.66  percentage  points  per  year;  Wegener  et  al,  J  Cyst  Fibros.  2018;17(4):503-10) 
therefore  not  suggesting  a  positive  trend  on  ppFEV1  However,  given  the  small  sample  size  of  Study 
117  paediatric  subgroup  and  the  wide  CI  that  crosses  0,  no  conclusions  can  be  made  regarding  the 
effect  of  Orkambi  treatment  on  ppFEV1  in  this  subgroup.  Of  note,  supportive  results  of  Orkambi 
effectiveness on ppFEV1 are coming from the larger, ongoing comparator-controlled PASS, on average 
from 2014 to 2018 the ppFEV1 decreased by 3.7 percentage points in the Orkambi Disease Progression 
Cohort and decreased by 6.9 percentage points in the Comparator Disease Progression Cohort.   
No  major  differences,  although  with  numerical  slight  decreases,  were  observed  in  the  paediatric 
subgroup between pre-index period and post index period for: annualized  PEx  rate [PEx per patient 
per year (SD) was 1.1 (1.52) in the pre-index period and 0.9 (1.01) in the post-index period]; rate of 
hospitalizations  [hospitalizations  per  patient  per  year  (SD)  was  1.2  (2.17)  in  the  pre-index  period 
and  0.8  (1.19)  in  the  post-index  period],  outpatient  visits  [outpatient  visits  per  patient  per  year) 
(SD) was 6.0 (4.62) in the pre-index period and 5.4 (2.81) in the post-index period], acute antibiotic 
prescriptions [acute antibiotic prescriptions per patient per year (SD) was 3.4 (4.03) in the pre-index 
period  and  3.1  (5.01)  in  the  post-index  period],  and  the  proportion  of  patients  with  positive  P. 
aeruginosa  after  Orkambi  initiation  (56.7%  before  Orkambi  initiation  and  50%  after  Orkambi 
initiation). There were no lung transplants or deaths in the paediatric subgroup. 
As  regards  to  Use  of  CF  Medications  Other  than  Antibiotics,  most  categories  of  concomitant 
medications  other  than  antibiotics  remained  unchanged  or  decreased  between  pre  and  post-index 
period,  apart  from  the  categories “anti-flammatory  drug”  and  “diabetes  control”  that  showed  a  3.3% 
increase;  however  the  interpretation  of  these  data  is  limited,  as  most  concomitant  medications  were 
categorized as “Others” (18/30, 60% in the pre index period and 15/30, 50% in the post index period). 
Conclusion: 
The  MAH  provided  the  requested  descriptive  results  regarding  Orkambi  effectiveness  in  the  subgroup 
of paediatric patients 12 through 17 years of age from Study 117. These data present limitations and 
should  be  interpreted  with  caution  due  to  the  low  number  of  paediatric  subjects  aged  12-17  years 
enrolled (N=30, among them N=17 ‘early initiators’ and N=13 ‘late initiators’), the retrospective data 
collection from patient medical records and the exploratory nature of the study. 
A more severe pattern of baseline disease characteristics was observed in early initiators as compared 
to late initiators. 
Results  seem  not  suggesting  a  positive  trend  on  ppFEV1.  However,  given  the  small  sample  size  of 
Study 117 paediatric subgroup and the wide CI that crosses 0, no conclusions can be made. Of note, 
supportive  results  of  Orkambi  effectiveness  on  ppFEV1  are  coming  from  the  larger,  ongoing 
comparator-controlled PASS. 
Increases in weight and BMI were observed in the paediatric subgroup between pre-index period and 
post  index  period.  There  were  no  major  differences  for  other  variables/outcomes;  slight  numerical 
decreases were observed.

observed  in  the  same  age  range  in  pivotal  clinical  trials  (1.0%,  3/290  subjects),  baseline 
clinical  characteristics  of  the  subgroup  of  30  paediatric  subjects  included  in  Study  117  are 
needed.  Baseline  clinical  characteristics  of  the  subgroup  of  30  paediatric  subjects  included 
in  Study  117  should  be  discussed  by  the  MAH  in  comparison  with  baseline  clinical 
characteristics  of  adolescents  12  through  17  years  of  age,  enrolled  in  the  pooled  placebo-
controlled Phase 3 studies (pivotal Studies 103 and 104). 
Summary of the MAH’s Response 
The  demographics  and  baseline  characteristics  of  the  30  paediatric  patients  from  Study  117  are 
discussed in the response to Question 1 and provided in Ad Hoc Table 24. 
As  discussed  in  the  response  to  Question  1,  Study  117  paediatric  subgroup  results  should  be 
interpreted  with  caution  due  to  the  exploratory  nature  of  the  study  and  the  small  sample  size.  In 
addition, it is not appropriate to compare baseline characteristics between a real-world evidence study 
and  randomized,  controlled  clinical  studies  that  differ  with  respect  to  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria. 
Inclusion in Study 117 was based on a treatment initiation date within 6 months of Orkambi approval, 
while Studies 103/104 had inclusion and exclusion criteria relating to CF disease status, comorbidities, 
medical history, and ppFEV1. 
A  brief  summary  of  the  available  baseline  characteristics  for  the  paediatric  subgroups  for  both  Study 
117 and Studies 103/104 is provided in Table 2. A few baseline characteristics that were collected in 
Study 117 were not collected in Studies 103/104, including CF comorbid conditions, PEx, intravenous 
(IV) antibiotics, inpatient hospitalizations for CF, and CF-related PEx.

Assessor’s comment 
The MAH provided the requested data. 
It  is  acknowledged  that  comparing  baseline  characteristics  between  a  real-world  evidence  study  and 
randomized,  controlled  clinical  studies  presents  limitations  and  that  Study  117  paediatric  subgroup 
results should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size.  
Some baseline characteristics that were collected in Study 117 were not collected in Studies 103/104, 
such as CF comorbid conditions 
It is of note that ppFEV1 value of patients 12 to 17 years of age enrolled in Study 117 is higher (mean 
89.5, SD 20.51) in comparison to patients of the same age range enrolled in pivotal studies 103/104 
(mean  67.3,  SD  13.0)  underlying  a  quite  different  lung  function  as  measured  by  ppFEV1  at  baseline 
surely  limiting  indirect  comparability  of  study  results  but  possibly  not  substantially  contributing  to  a 
higher treatment discontinuation observed in the 117 study. 
Conclusion: The issue is not pursued further. 
Question 3 
The  MAH  is  requested  to  discuss  the  high  frequency  of  discontinuation  (35.8%)  and  to 
discuss available data on the reasons for discontinuations observed in the adult population 
of patients enrolled in Study 117. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The  reasons  for  treatment  discontinuation  after  first  initiation  in  the  overall  population  in  Study  117 
were  (in  order  of  most  common  to  least  common):  respiratory  adverse  event  (AE)  (39  patients 
[52.0%]), other reason (17 patients [22.7%]), other AE (9 patients [12.0%]), lack of effectiveness (5 
patients  [6.7%]),  unknown  (3  patients  [4.0%]),  and  gastrointestinal  AE  (2  patients  [2.7%])  (Study 
117 CSR/Table 6). Additional information from the study case report forms (CRFs) that was entered by 
the  site  as  free  text  is  provided  in  Table  3  for  the  adult  subgroup  (≥18  years  of  age),  and  provides 
additional  context  for  those  patients  who  had  “other  reason”  and  “other  AE”  listed  as  the  primary 
reason  for  treatment  discontinuation.  Overall,  the  distribution  of  the  primary  reasons  for 
discontinuation was generally consistent with that observed in clinical experience, with respiratory AEs 
being the most common, consistent with the SmPC. 
Annual interim analysis results from the larger, registry-based, 5-year post-authorization safety study 
(PASS)  Study  108  represents  a  more  robust  data  set  and  indicates  a  lower  discontinuation  rate  than 
that  observed  in  Study  117.  The  proportion  of  patients  in  the  Orkambi  Safety  Cohort  who  had  no 
record  of  Orkambi  use  in  the  subsequent  calendar  year  suggests  a  discontinuation  rate  of  10.1%  for 
the  2016  Orkambi  Safety  Cohort  (N=  5,553)  and  12.2%  for  the  2017  Orkambi  Safety  Cohort  (N  = 
6,664). The data from this study, given the larger sample size and longer duration, may be considered 
more representative of the real-world Orkambi experience.

Assessor’s comment 
The MAH provided the requested data.  
A high frequency of discontinuation (35.8%) was observed in the overall population of Study 117.  
The  reasons  for  treatment  discontinuation  were  respiratory  AEs  (39  patients  [52.0%]),  other  reason 
(17  patients  [22.7%]),  other  AE  (9  patients  [12.0%]),  lack  of  effectiveness  (5  patients  [6.7%]), 
unknown (3 patients [4.0%]), and gastrointestinal AE (2 patients [2.7%]) (Study 117 CSR/Table 6).  
As  regards  to  discontinuation  categorized  as  “Other  reason”  or  “Other  AE”,  the  MAH  provided  the 
information from the study case report forms (CRFs) that was entered by the site as free text: 5 out of 
9  patients  categorized  as  “Other  AEs”  discontinued  due  to  the  following  reasons  (one  patient  each): 
psych  issues  and  abdominal  pain  issues,  elevated  liver  enzymes,  urinary  hesitancy/  headaches/  leg 
cramps, worsened depression, rash/ chest tightness.  Among the 17 patients that discontinued due to 
other reasons, most patients discontinued due to AEs [n=10; the AEs were the following: respiratory 
AEs (2), dizziness (2), cutaneous AE (2, including one event of Steven Johnson), elevated LFT (2), side 
effects unspecified (2)]. Two discontinuation each were due to death and organ transplant.  
As  regards  to  the  types  of  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation,  the  events  were  mostly  known  ADRs  for 
Orkambi. 
In the annual interim analysis results from the larger, registry-based, 5-year post-authorization safety 
study (PASS) Study 108,  the proportion of patients in the Orkambi Safety Cohort who had no record 
of Orkambi use in the subsequent calendar year suggests a discontinuation rate of 10.1% for the 2016 
Orkambi Safety Cohort (N= 5,553) and 12.2% for the 2017 Orkambi Safety Cohort (N = 6,664).  
Conclusion: 
A  high  frequency  of  discontinuation  (35.8%)  was  observed  in  the  overall  population  of  Study  117, 
however  the  adverse  events  leading  to  discontinuation  were  mostly  known  ADRs  for  Orkambi.  It  is 
acknowledged  that  the  data  from  the  PASS  study,  given  the  larger  sample  size  and  longer  duration, 
may be considered more representative of the real-world Orkambi experience.

Question 4 
The MAH is requested to provide all available information (including age) of the 7 subjects 
requiring  lung  transplant  after  Orkambi  initiation  and  of  the  2  deaths  observed  during  the 
post  index  period.  The  higher  proportion  of  patients  requiring  at  least  one  organ 
transplantation  after  Orkambi  initiation  in  Study  117  (3.2%)  in  comparison  to  the 
proportion of patients with a history of any organ transplant (0.4%) in the Orkambi Safety 
Cohort in 2018 in PASS Study 108 should be discussed.

Summary of the MAH’s response 
Table 26 provides the age at the time that Orkambi was prescribed for the 7 patients who had a lung 
transplant and the 2 patients who died during the post-index period. For death and organ transplant, 
there  was  no  option  in  the  CRFs  for  the  sites  to  provide  any  additional  description  regarding  these 
events. As such, no further information is available on these patients. 
Table 26 Age for Patients Who Had Lung Transplant or Death 
As  discussed  previously,  Study  117  was  an  exploratory  chart  study  to  explore  the  early  treatment 
patterns  following  the  initial  US  approval.  The  ongoing  PASS  Study  108  is  a  comparator  controlled, 
registry-based study that is collecting real-world data from a much larger population of CF patients and 
over  a  longer  observational  period.  The  results  from  the  ongoing  PASS  have  demonstrated  a 
significantly  lower  risk  of  death  and  organ  transplantation  in  Orkambi-treated  patients  and  will 
continue to provide real-world data on the Orkambi experience. 
Assessor’s comment 
The age at the time that Orkambi was prescribed for the 7 patients who had a lung transplant ranged 
from  23  to  56  years  of  age.  There  were  2  patients  who  died  during  the  post-index  period.  The  MAH 
clarified  that  no  further  information  is  available  on  these  patients,  given  that  for  death  and  organ 
transplant, there was no option in the CRFs for the sites to provide any additional description regarding 
these events.  
In the third interim analysis of the ongoing PASS, cconsistently with the previous 2 interim reports, the 
risk of death and organ transplant was statistically significantly lower in the Orkambi Cohort compared 
to the Comparator Cohort.  
Conclusion: 
In Study 117, a higher proportion of patients (3.2%) required lung transplant after Orkambi initiation 
in  comparison  to  the  proportion  of  patients  with  a  history  of  any  organ  transplant  (0.4%)  in  the 
Orkambi Safety Cohort in 2018 in PASS Study 108.  
It  is  acknowledged  that  the  data  from  the  PASS  study,  given  the  larger  sample  size  and  longer 
duration, may be considered more representative of the real-world Orkambi experience. 
Issue resolved. 
Overall, the MAH has addressed all questions raised during the procedure satisfactorily. There are no 
further points. The benefit-risk assessment is considered favourable.

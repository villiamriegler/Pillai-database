Part VI: Summary of the Risk Management Plan 
Summary of Risk Management Plan for Seffalair® Spiromax® 12.75 micrograms/100 
micrograms inhalation powder; Seffalair® Spiromax® 12.75 micrograms/202 micrograms 
inhalation powder 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Seffalair® Spiromax® 12.75 
micrograms/100 micrograms inhalation powder; Seffalair® Spiromax® 12.75 micrograms/202 
micrograms inhalation powder (herein after also referred to as Seffalair® Spiromax®). The RMP 
details important risks of Seffalair® Spiromax®, how these risks can be minimised, and how 
more information will be obtained about Seffalair® Spiromax®'s risks and uncertainties (missing 
information). 
Seffalair® Spiromax®'s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Seffalair® Spiromax® 
should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Seffalair® Spiromax® should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, 
all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Seffalair® 
Spiromax®'s RMP. 
I. The Medicine and What It is used for 
Seffalair® Spiromax® is authorised for regular treatment of asthma (see SmPC for the full 
indication). It contains salmeterol and fluticasone propionate as active substances and it is given 
as inhalation powder. 
Further information about the evaluation of Seffalair® Spiromax®’s benefits can be found in 
Seffalair® Spiromax®’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/seffalair-spiromax. 
II. Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further 
Characterise the Risks  
Important risks of Seffalair® Spiromax®, together with measures to minimise such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about Seffalair® Spiromax®’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
 
 
 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
II.A List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Seffalair® Spiromax® are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Seffalair® Spiromax®. Potential risks are 
concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available 
data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing 
and needs to be collected (eg. on the long-term use of the medicine).

Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
SmPC; known effect of systemic corticosteroid use. 
The potential for the development of adrenal insufficiency is proportional 
to the dose and duration of corticosteroids administration. Asthma patients 
requiring frequent courses of systemic corticosteroids are therefore at 
heightened risk. Patients receiving potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (eg. 
ritonavir) that cause increased systemic exposure of ICS are also at 
increased risk. Adolescents 12 years and older receiving prolonged 
treatment are at risk of growth retardation.

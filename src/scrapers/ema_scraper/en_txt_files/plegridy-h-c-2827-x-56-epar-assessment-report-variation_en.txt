1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
Biogen Netherlands B.V. submitted on 10 February 2020 an extension of the marketing authorisation 
(MA). 
Extension  application  to  introduce  a  new  route  of  administration  (intramuscular  use)  for  the  125  µg 
solution for injection. 
The  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  applied  for  a  change  or  addition  of  a  new  route  of 
administration. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 and Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, 
(2) point(e) - Extensions of marketing authorisations 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant  to  Article  8  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  the  application  included  an  EMA  Decision(s) 
P/0371/2019 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP)  
At  the  time  of  submission  of  the  application,  the  PIP  P/0371/2019  was  not  yet  completed  as  some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000,  the  MAH  did  not  submit  a  critical  report  addressing  the  possible  similarity  with  authorised 
orphan  medicinal  products  because  there  is  no  authorised  orphan  medicinal  product  for  a  condition 
related to the proposed indication.

within the Committee, issued a positive opinion for granting a marketing 
authorisation to Plegridy on  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Plegridy  is  an  interferon  beta-1a  with  a  prolonged  response  (due  to  Polyethylene  Glycol  [PEG] 
conjugation). It is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis 
(RRMS).  
The recommended dose of Plegridy is 125 micrograms injected subcutaneously (SC) every 2 weeks. The 
product may be self-administered by patients. 
The product is available as a 63, 94 and 125 micrograms strength, both in a pre-filled syringe and a pre-
filled pen. The lower strengths are used for dose titration at the start of treatment, to prevent flu-like 
symptoms. 
The  current  application  concerns  an  extension  application.  The  MAH  proposes  to  add  intramuscular 
injection (IM) to offer patients an alternative route of administration with fewer injection site reactions 
(ISRs) as compared to subcutaneous injection.  
A new pre-filled syringe has been developed for this purpose. The syringe contains 125 micrograms of 
peginterferon beta-1a. The dose can be limited to 63 micrograms and 94 micrograms with the use of 
titration clips.

2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Plegridy is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of RRMS.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
Multiple  sclerosis  (MS)  is  a  chronic  disease  of  the  central  nervous  system  (CNS)  with  a  worldwide 
prevalence  estimated  at  2  to  2.5  million  patients.  The  disease  is  unevenly  distributed  throughout  the 
world; its prevalence varies between <5 cases per 100,000 people in tropical areas and Asia and >100 
to  200  cases  per  100,000  in  temperate  areas,  especially  those  with  large  populations  of  Northern 
European origin. 
The worldwide incidence of MS is estimated to be 3.6 cases per 100,000 person-years in women (95% 
confidence  interval  [CI]  3.0-4.2)  and  2.0  cases  per  100,000  person-years  in  men  (95%  CI  1.5-2.4) 
[Alonso  and  Hernan  2008].  Therefore,  MS  is  approximately  twice  as  common  in  women  as  men  and 
predominantly affects adults aged 20 to 60 years. 
A genetic predisposition to MS exists, particularly variation involving the HLA-DRB1 locus [Lincoln 2005; 
Sawcer  2011].  Risk  is  elevated  if  a  family  member  has  MS  [Ebers  2008].  Risk  of  MS  increases  with 
increasing geographic latitude. Vitamin D deficiency has been found to significantly increase the risk of 
developing MS, so reduced sunlight exposure during childhood at higher latitudes may be an explanation 
for the geographic phenomenon [Ascherio and Munger 2007]. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The aetiology of MS is unknown, the synergic effect of genetic and environmental factor leads to immune-
mediated  inflammatory  activity  of  the  CNS  that  lead  to  destruction  of  the  myelin  sheath  and  axonal 
injury. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
MS can present with a range of neurological symptoms depending on the category of disease and location 
of the lesions, but commonly reported symptoms in established, untreated MS are visual dysfunction, 
weakness, which is frequently lower limb, sensory symptoms, and bladder problems, and progressive 
ambulatory  decline  will  affect  a  sizable  proportion  of  patients  with  MS.  Diagnosis  of  MS  is  based  on 
clinical  presentation  together  with  the  findings  in  the  magnetic  resonance  imaging  [Mc  Donald  2001, 
2010, 2017].  
RRMS is the most common form of MS, representing approximately 85% of patients at diagnosis. The 
course of RRMS is unpredictable, with variable periods of disease activity interspersed with periods of 
stability. According to earlier natural history studies, approximately 40% and 25% of patients with RRMS 
will, within the first 15 years after diagnosis, need to use a walking aid and be wheelchair-dependent 
[Myhr  2001].  Recent  findings  from  cohorts  of  patients  mostly  treated  with  disease  modifying  drugs 
(DMDs) from early onset have found lower transition rates to secondary progressive MS.  
2.1.5.  Management 
There  is  no  cure  available  for  MS.  Therapies  for  MS  include  treatment  for  relapses  (e.g.  steroids), 
symptomatic treatments (e.g. drugs for stabilization of nerve conduction, drugs for managing fatigue, 
depression, pain) and those that alter the course of the disease (DMDs). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/594296/2020

There  are  several  DMD  for  MS  including  beta  interferons  (IFN  β)  (Avonex,  Betaferon  and  Rebif), 
glatiramer  acetate  (Copaxone),  teriflunomide  (Aubagio),  dimethyl  fumarate  (Tecfidera),  fingolimod 
(Gilenya), siponimod (Mayzent), ozanimod (Zeposia), alemtuzumab (Lemtrada), natalizumab (Tysabri), 
ocrelizumab (Ocrevus), cladribine (Mavenclad).  
About the product 
Plegridy  is  a  PEG-modified  interferon  beta-1a  (Company  Code:  BIIB017)  that  is  approved  for  the 
treatment of RRMS.  
BIIB017 binds to the type I interferon receptor on the surface of cells and elicits a cascade of intracellular 
events leading to the regulation of interferon-responsive gene expression. Biological effects that may be 
mediated  by  BIIB017  include  up-regulation  of  anti-inflammatory  cytokines  (e.g.  IL-4,  IL-10,  IL-27), 
down-regulation  of  pro-inflammatory  cytokines  (e.g.  IL-2,  IL-12,  IFN-γ,  TNF-α)  and  inhibiting  the 
migration of activated T cells across the blood brain barrier. However, the full/definitive mechanism of 
action for BIIB017 is not known, as the pathophysiology of MS is only partially understood. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This dossier concerns a line extension application for Plegridy (peginterferon beta-1a) to add IM injection 
as an additional route of administration for the adult population. Peginterferon beta-1a is administered 
every 2 weeks via SC injection and is approved for RRMS in adults. The basis for this application is an 
open-label, multicentre, 2-period crossover study (105HV106) to assess the bioequivalence of BIIB017 
administered by SC and IM injection in healthy volunteers. 
Existing IFN β on the market are available for either SC or IM injection. The approval of BIIB017 for IM 
administration  will  provide  patients  with  an  alternative  route  of  administration  along  with  the 
convenience of less frequent IM dosing seen with a pegylated interferon compared with a non-pegylated 
interferon. In addition, data from the literature show that the IM administration of IFN β-1a resulted in 
fewer ISRs than the SC route [Balak 2012; Minagara 2008]. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The  current  application  concerns  a  line  extension  for  Plegridy  to  be  administered  via  the  IM  route  as 
addition to the current MA for Plegridy, which is administered SC for RRMS. Besides the different route 
of administration, Plegridy for IM and SC administration share the same indication, posology, composition 
and formulation.  
The active substance of Plegridy is peginterferon beta-1a, herein referred to as BIIB017. BIIB017 pre-
filled syringe (PFS) for IM injection will only be manufactured in the administration dose strength of 125 
μg (micrograms) per syringe.  
The only differences between the BIIB017 PFS for IM injection and the approved BIIB017 PFS for  SC 
injection are:   
(1)  the new finished product manufacturing site with slightly adapted manufacturing process,  
(2)  the container closure; a 1 mL Becton Dickinson (BD) Luer Lock (LL) syringe, instead of a 1 mL staked 
needle syringe 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/594296/2020  
Page 9/38 
 
 
 
 
(3)  the  co-packaged needle  (23G,  1.25ʺ  stainless  steel),  instead  of  staked needle  (29G,  0.5”stainless 
steel) 
(4)  the method of titration utilising titration clip devices, which control the administered dose to ½ and 
¾ of the administration dose syringe, instead of availability of administration dose strength of 63 
and 94 μg. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
There were no changes made to this section as the same active substance (BIIB017-B) is used to produce 
BIIB017 delivered IM or SC.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development  
The BIIB017 finished product is a sterile, liquid formulation in a PFS for IM injection containing 125 μg 
of peginterferon beta-1a. Other excipients are: sodium acetate trihydrate; acetic acid, glacial; arginine 
hydrochloride; polysorbate 20 and water for injections. No novel excipients are used. 
BIIB017  PFS  for  IM  injection  is  supplied  in  a  sterile  1  mL  Type  I  borosilicate  glass  syringe  with  a 
bromobutyl  rubber  plunger  stopper  and  OVS  tamper-evident  seal.  BIIB017  is  filled  into  the  PFS  at  a 
nominal volume of 0.5 mL. The intended dosage form for use by the patient consists of the PFS with 125 
μg  strength  for  titration  and  administration  dosing.  Titration  of  the  dose  during  the  first  month  of 
treatment is controlled with titration clip devices.  
Pharmaceutical Development   
Composition of the PFS finished product for IM use is identical to the already approved PFS for SC use. 
The same active substance (BIIB017-B) and the same excipients are used to produce BIIB017 delivered 
IM or SC.  
Development of BIIB017 finished product for IM injection included transfer of the BIIB017 manufacturing 
process to with a slightly adapted manufacturing process. Minor changes are introduced in the filtration 
step, the finished product filling and the component preparation step: 
 -  A filter flush was implemented prior to filtration as process improvement in the bioburden reduction 
filtration on bulk finished product. 
 -  Due to differences in hold up volume between SC and IM needles, a slightly higher target fill volume 
is  utilised  in  the  IM  process.  This  is  to  ensure  that  the  target  dose  is  delivered  with  the  larger  IM 
needle and Luer Lock syringe hold-up volume. 
 - Closure of LL syringe is required (tamper-evident seal - OVS). 
The differences between the manufacturing processes at the current manufacturer for SC syringes and 
new manufacturer for IM syringes are well described. 
Comparability  between  the  manufacturing  process  for  PFS  for  IM  injection  and  the  manufacturing  
process  for  PFS  for  SC  injection  has  been  shown  by  comparing  the  release  data  and  additional 
characterisation of subvisible particulate matter of three process performance qualification (PPQ) batches 
PFS for IM injection with historical ranges of 76 PFS batches for SC injection.   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/594296/2020  
Page 10/38 
 
 
 
Results show that the IM finished product is comparable with the SC finished product, with the exception 
of extractable volume. Extractable volume is slightly higher for IM batches due to the higher fill volume 
target.  Due  to  differences  in  hold  up  volume  between  SC  and  IM  needles,  a  slightly  higher  target  fill 
volume is utilised in the IM process. This is to ensure that the target dose is delivered with the larger IM 
needle and Luer Lock syringe hold-up volume. 
The differences between the container closure system for the PFS for IM injection and the PFS for SC 
injection are differences in the needle (difference in length and gauge required for IM presentation) and 
differences in the closure. The Luer Lock syringe requires tamper evident seal and LL connection and tip 
cap. Suitability of the container closure system has been shown by container closure integrity testing, 
extractables and leachables studies and functionality testing.  
Container closure integrity testing was performed during process validation, shipping qualification and 
long-term storage.  
Data of extractables and leachables studies for the materials in contact with the finished product were 
submitted. The presented results do not raise any safety concerns.  
The  results  of  functional  testing  were  provided.  Functionality  studies  at  stability  conditions  up  to  48 
months (at 5°C); up to 9 months (at 25°C) and up to 6 months (at 40°C) are ongoing.  
The low doses (63 and 94 μg) will be administered by the use of titration clip devices. The CE-marked 
medical  devices  are  supplied  as  Titration  Kit  in  a  separate  package.  Information  on  design  and 
performance of these titration clip devices has been provided. The administration of the correct doses, 
as mentioned in the Summary of product characteristics (SmPC), using these titration clip devices has 
been shown in dose accuracy studies.  
The MAH did not perform a traditional human factor study, however a comparative usability assessment 
was  performed  against  the  AVOSTARTGRIP®  device,  i.e.  an  already  available  titration  clip  device  for 
administration of IFN β.  
The  MAH  has  changed  the  artwork  for  the  carton  exterior,  packaging  and  package  leaflet  to  clearly 
distinguish between the SC and IM formulation. Furthermore, the physical presentations of the products 
differ. Therefore, the probability of occurrence of administration of incorrect medication in the titration 
phase (confusion between the IM and SC formulation) is assessed as “low”.   
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Plegridy IM PFS finished product is manufactured, released, stored, labelled, and packaged in accordance 
with  current  Good  Manufacturing  Practice  (cGMP).  The  manufacturing  of  BIIB017  finished  product 
consists of the following steps: 
– Step 1: Compounding of Formulation Buffer 
– Step 2: Thawing of the Bulk Drug Substance 
– Step 3: Pooling and Mixing 
– Step 4: Addition of Formulation Buffer to Achieve Target Protein Concentration and Formulation 
– Step 5: Filtration into Dispensing Vessel 
– Step 6: Sterile Filtration to the Filling Line 
– Step 7: Aseptic Syringe Filling and Plunger Placement 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/594296/2020  
Page 11/38 
 
 
 
– Step 8: 100% Visual Inspection 
– Step 9: Finished product storage 
The manufacturing process has been well described. The process controls and control of critical steps 
and intermediates are the same as for the SC manufacturing process and are acceptable.  
Process evaluation consisted of the production of three PPQ batches in which several hold times were 
challenged. Finished product release assays were performed on the filled LL syringes, and the results 
were  compared  to  the  release  specification  and  historic  database  for  the  licensed  BIIB017  finished 
product administered SC.  
The results confirm that the finished product manufacturing process for BIIB017 finished product for IM 
injection at is validated.  
Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
The finished product specification includes tests for identity, quantity, potency (by antiviral cytopathic 
effect assay), purity and safety. 
The  specifications  for  BIIB017  PFS  for  IM  injection  specifications  are  identical  to  or  tighter  than  the 
specifications  for  BIIB017  PFS  for  SC  injection.  The  specifications  for  protein  concentration,  oxidation 
and biantennary sialylation are tightened as a result of re-evaluation of the specifications for BIIB017 
PFS for SC injection. The information provided in this section is sufficient and acceptable. 
Analytical procedures 
Except for container closure integrity testing as sufficiently detailed in the dossier, all analytical methods 
are the same as for the BIIB017 finished product for SC injection. The method validations have been 
adequately summarized. 
Batch analysis 
The release test results for the PPQ lots of BIIB017 finished product for IM injection have been provided. 
A summary of the lots, their manufacturing history, and purpose of use have been presented.  
All results met the release specifications, demonstrating the quality and consistency of the commercial 
manufacturing process. 
Stability of the product 
A shelf life of 36 months when stored at 2 °C to 8 °C is claimed for the finished product. 
Based on the stability data presented the same shelf-life (36 months at 5°C with an allowance of storage 
for up to 30 days at room temperature (not to exceed 25 °C) within the 36-month shelf life) has been 
claimed  for  BIIB017  finished  product  for  IM  injection  as  is  currently  approved  for  BIIB017  finished 
product for SC injection.  
The applicant has submitted a comparative stability evaluation of IM and SC presentations demonstrating 
that  both  presentations  behave  similar  upon  storage  and  therefore  the  same  shelf-life  is  considered 
acceptable for commercial lots BIIB017 PFS for IM injection as is currently approved for BIIB017 PFS for 
SC injection.

A shelf life of 36 months when stored at 2 °C to 8 °C is acceptable for the finished product. Plegridy for 
SC or IM administration can be stored at room temperature (up to 25 °C) for up to 30 days protected 
from light, after this period it should be discarded. 
Post approval change management protocol(s)  
Not applicable. 
Adventitious agents 
Plegridy active substance is the same for Plegridy SC and IM. There are no process changes/differences 
in  the  active  substance,  hence  Virology  testing  is  the  same  as  what  is  currently  registered  in  section 
3.2.A Adventitious Agents Safety Evaluation for Plegridy SC MAA. 
No changes were made to this section. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The  current  application  concerns  a  line  extension  for  Plegridy  to  be  administered  via  the  IM  route  as 
addition to the current MA for Plegridy, which is administered SC for RRMS.  
Besides  the  different  route  of  administration,  Plegridy  for  IM  and  SC  administration  share  the  same 
indication,  posology  and  formulation.  BIIB017  PFS  for  IM  injection  will  only  be  manufactured  in  the 
administration dose strength of 125 μg per syringe.  
The differences between the BIIB017 PFS for IM injection and the approved BIIB017 PFS for SC injection 
were justified and adequately discussed.  
Composition of the PFS finished product for IM use is identical to the already approved PFS for SC use. 
The same active substance (peginterferon beta-1a, BIIB017-B) is used to produce BIIB017 delivered IM 
or SC.  
Comparability  between  the  manufacturing  process  for  PFS  for  IM  injection  and  the  manufacturing  
process  for  PFS  for  SC  injection  has  been  shown  by  comparing  the  release  data  and  additional 
characterisation of subvisible particulate matter of three PPQ batches PFS for IM injection with historical 
ranges of 76 PFS batches for SC injection. Results show that the IM finished product is comparable with 
the SC finished product, with the exception of extractable volume. Extractable volume is slightly higher 
for IM batches due to the higher fill volume target. Due to differences in hold up volume between SC 
and IM needles, a slightly higher target fill volume is utilised in the IM process. This is to ensure the 
target dose is delivered with the larger IM needle and Luer Lock syringe hold-up volume. 
The differences between the container closure system for the PFS for IM injection and the PFS for SC 
injection are differences in the needle (difference in length and gauge required for IM presentation) and 
differences in the closure. The Luer Lock syringe requires tamper evident seal and LL connection and tip 
cap. Suitability of the container closure system has been shown by container closure integrity testing, 
extractables and leachables studies and functionality testing.  
LL syringes for IM use are washed, siliconised, and sterilised, while the approved syringes for SC use are 
siliconised and sterilised by the supplier.  
The manufacturing process has been well described. Process evaluation consisted of the production of 
three  PPQ  batches  in  which  several  hold  times  were  challenged.  It  has  been  shown  that  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/594296/2020  
Page 13/38 
 
 
 
manufacturing process is well controlled. The specifications for BIIB017 PFS for IM injection specifications 
are identical to or tighter than specifications for BIIB017 PFS for SC injection. 
The adventitious agents safety is sufficiently assured, and no changes were made to this section. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The overall quality of this line extension for Plegridy is considered acceptable when used in accordance 
with  the  conditions  defined  in  the  SmPC.  The  different  aspects  of  the  chemical,  pharmaceutical  and 
biological  documentation  comply  with  existing  guidelines.  The  manufacturing  process  of  the  finished 
product has been satisfactorily described and validated. The quality of the finished product is controlled 
by adequate test methods and specifications.  
In conclusion, based on the review of the quality data provided, this line extension application for Plegridy 
to add the IM route of administration is considered approvable from the quality point of view. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommended some points for further investigation.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Peginterferon beta-1a (or BIIB017) currently approved administration is via SC injection using a single-
use pre-filled pen or pre-filled syringe (available at 3 different concentrations - 64, 94 and 125 µg/0.5 
ml). IM administration using a single use pre-filled syringe is being proposed as an alternative route of 
administration. IM injection will only be manufactured in the dose strength of 125 μg per syringe but 
with titration clips to deliver the lower doses of 63 and 94 μg. 
Study  105HV106  was  submitted  to  support  the  application  with  a  primary  objective  of  assessing  the 
bioequivalence  of  BIIB017  administered  by  SC  and  IM  injection  in  healthy  volunteers.  Secondary 
objectives of this study were to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and additional pharmacokinetics (PK) 
parameters of SC administration as compared with IM administration of BIIB017 in healthy volunteers. 
In addition, as exploratory objectives, pharmacodynamics (PD) parameters such as neopterin and titre 
of binding antibodies to the pegylated and IFN β-1a components of BIIB01 were planned to be evaluated. 
The latter was not carried out since there were no unusual PK or safety results. 
Pharmacokinetics of BIIB017 were characterized previously in the original MAA. During that time a small 
study  (Study  105HV101)  in  healthy  volunteers  evaluated  PK  and  PD  of  BIIB017  following  SC  and  IM 
administration  of  a  dose  of  125  µg  BIIB017.  Although  the  findings  from  that  study  suggested  similar 
bioavailability following SC and IM administration, no conclusion could be drawn because the sample size 
was too low (N= 8 subjects per administration). In this report, the PK and PD results of Study105HV106 
were described and discussed. 
Methods  
Study design 
Study 105HV106 was an open-label, multi-center, 2-period, crossover study to assess the bioequivalence 
and tolerability of BIIB017 administered by SC and IM injection in healthy volunteers. 
According to the MAH, the Investigators obtained institutional review board (IRB, Midlands Independent 
Review Board, Kansas, USA) approval for the study protocol and all amendments. 
The clinical study was conducted in 2 sites of Covance Clinical Research Unit Inc. in the USA (i.e. Daytona 
Beach, Florida and Dallas, Texas). The date of 1st treatment was on 3 December 2018 and the end of 
study was on 24 May 2019. The PK-samples were analysed at the BioAgilitix Labs (Durham, NC, USA) 
on 5 March – 2 July 2019. The PD-samples were analysed at Charles River Laboratories (Quebec, Canada) 
on 4 April - 29 May 2019. The study report is dated 31 October 2019. 
After a screening period of up to 28 days, volunteers reported to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) on 
Day -1 of Period 1 (Check-in) and on Day 1 of Period 1, volunteers were randomized 1:1 to treatment 
sequence 1 or 2. Volunteers were dosed on Day 1 of Period 1 and discharged from the CRU on Day 15 
of Period 1. Volunteers returned for outpatient visits on Days 17, 19, and 22 of Period 1. After a washout 
period of a minimum of 27 days following Day 1 of Period 1, volunteers returned to the CRU on Day -1 
of Period 2 (Check-in). Volunteers were dosed on Day 1 of Period 2 and discharged from the CRU on Day 
15 of Period 2. Volunteers returned for outpatient visits on Days 17, 19, and 22 of Period 2. 
Each volunteer received both of the following treatments administered to the anterolateral thigh: 
• 
• 
Treatment A (test): A single IM dose of 125 μg BIIB017. 
Treatment B (reference): A single SC dose of 125 μg BIIB017. 
The study scheme is depicted in Figure 1

Figure 1: Study Schematic of Crossover Design 
CRU = Clinical Research Unit; IM = intramuscular; SC = subcutaneous. 
Day -1 of Period 2 was to occur 27 (+3) days after Day 1 of Period 1 (dosing) in order that dose administrations occurred 28 (+3) 
days apart. 
Pharmacokinetics 
A total of 23 blood samples were collected for determining the concentrations of BIIB017 at the following 
time points relative to dosing on Day 1 of each period: within 2 hours prior to dosing and 3, 6, 12, 24, 
32, 40, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 192, 216, 240, 264, 288, 312, 336, 384, 432 and 504 hours post-
dose. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The same number and time points of blood samples as in the PK part were collected for determining 
neopterin serum levels. 
Immunogenicity 
Samples to test for the presence and titre of binding antibodies to PEG and IFN ß-1a were collected prior 
to dosing in each period and at the last outpatient visit on Day 22 of Period 2. These samples were stored 
to be analysed only in the event of an unexpected PK or safety finding. Since there were no unusual PK 
or  safety  results,  antibody  status  was  not  tested,  and  no  immunogenicity  data  are  available  for  this 
study. 
Safety 
Clinical assessments were performed to evaluate the safety profile of BIIB017. 
Investigated medicinal product for test and reference for treatment 
BIIB017  (20kDa  mPEG-O-2-methylpropionaldehyde-modified  human  IFN  β-1a)  was  provided  as  a 
solution  in  20  mM  acetic  acid/sodium  acetate  buffer  (pH  4.8),  150  mM  arginine  hydrochloride,  and 
0.005% Polysorbate 20 in volunteer-specific, labeled, prefilled syringe to deliver 0.5 mL of 0.25 mg/mL 
BIIB017 (125-μg dose). 
Population studied 
A total of 136 healthy subjects (61 females and 75 males), aged 21-55 years with a body mass index 
(BMI) of 19 – 30 kg/m2 were enrolled and dosed in period 1. Six subjects did not receive BIIB017 in 
period  2  due  to  AEs  (n=3),  non-compliance  (n=2)  and  physician  decision  (n=1).  Thus,  130  subjects 
(SC=66 and IM=64) were dosed in period 2 and available for PK analysis. In addition, 5 other subjects 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/594296/2020  
Page 16/38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were discontinued from the study due to lost to follow-up (n=1) and subject withdrawal (n=4). Hence, 
a total of 125 volunteers completed the study according to protocol. 
Analytical methods 
ELISA for measuring BIIB017 levels in serum 
For the study samples analysis, the system suitability and performance requirements were met. Global 
run accuracy and precision ranged from 94.2 to 100% and 8.5 to 10.3%, respectively.  
A total of 6,085 samples were analysed. A total of 241 runs were performed, of which 23 (9.5%) failed 
to  meet  the  acceptance  criteria  (i.e.  incorrect  calibrator  volume,  3/6  Control  Samples  (QCs)  failed, 
contamination of curve), and the samples were re-assayed on subsequent runs. Twelve additional runs 
were conducted to evaluate incurred sample re-analysis; of these 12 runs, 2 failed to meet acceptance 
criteria. These 2 runs were repeated, for a total of 14 sample re-analysis runs. 
A total of 274 samples (0.05 % of total samples analysed) was re-analysed due to the following reasons: 
concentration above upper limit of quantification = 190 samples, concentration measured for a pre-dose 
sample/repeated due to below the limit of quantification (BLQ) for second re-assay value = 3 samples, 
BLQ at dilution = 74 samples and others = 9 samples. 
For ISR, approximately 10% of the first 1000 samples, then 5% of the samples that exceed the initial 
1000 were tested. Individual incurred samples from multiple subjects between the maximum observed 
concentration  (Cmax)  and  the  elimination  phase  were  selected  and  a  total  of  372  samples  (5%)  were 
analyzed, of which 332 samples (88%) were within 30% of their mean. 
ELISA for measuring neopterin concentration in serum 
The  serum  concentration  of  neopterin  following  administration  of  BIIB017  125  μg  IM  and  SC  was 
measured for PD analysis. Neopterin is a protein that is synthesized by IFN-β activated monocytes and 
macrophages and is a well-established marker of IFN-β activity [Casoni 2004]. 
Based  on  the  positive  performance  of  the  standards  and  QCs  during  sample  analysis,  the  neopterin 
concentration values reported for the study samples from the ELISA assay were valid. 
The actual study samples were analysed in duplicate and sample analysis was repeated if the percentage 
of  coefficient  variation  (CV)  between  duplicate  drug  concentrations  was  >25%.  Mean  results  were 
reported and expressed as nmol/l. All study samples were analysed within the validated temperature, 
freeze/thaw cycles, and long-term storage stabilities. 
Immunogenicity Assessments 
Antibody status was not tested as no unusual PK or safety findings were observed. 
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
The  following  PK  parameters  were  calculated  using  non-compartmental  methods  using  Phoenix 
WinNonlin (Certara, USA, Inc., version 8.1): (primary) Cmax and area under the concentration-time curve 
from hour 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-∞), and (secondary), time to maximum observed concentration 
(tmax), Area under the concentration-time curve from hour 0 to hour 336 (AUC0-336), hour 504 (AUC0-504), 
and  the  last  measurable  concentration  (AUC0-last),  percentage  extrapolation  of  AUC∞  (%AUCextrap), 
terminal elimination rate constant (λZ), terminal elimination half-life (t1/2), apparent total body clearance 
(CL/F), and apparent volume of distribution during terminal elimination phase (Vd/F). 
All AUCs in PK analysis were calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule and the minimum requirement 
for the calculation of AUC is the inclusion of at least three consecutive serum concentrations above the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/594296/2020  
Page 17/38 
 
 
 
 
Lower Limit of Quantification (LLOQ), with at least one of these concentrations following Cmax. Percentage 
extrapolation greater than 20% were excluded from descriptive and formal statistics. 
Evaluation pharmacodynamic endpoints 
Neopterin levels were summarized by treatment group and nominal time point using descriptive statistics 
for the PD Population. Derived PD parameters including baseline concentration (Ebaseline), area under 
the effect-time curve from time zero to 336 hours postdose (EAUC0-336), area under the effect-time curve 
from time zero to 504 hours postdose (EAUC0-504), maximum effect (Epeak), and time to reach maximum 
effect (ETmax) were summarized using arithmetic mean, standard deviation (SD), CV%, geometric mean 
and geometric CV%, median, minimum, and maximum by treatment group for the PD Population. 
Evaluation of immunogenicity 
No evaluation was done since immunogenicity testing was not performed. 
Statistical methods 
The statistical analysis was performed using the software package SAS® 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, 
NC, USA). 
A  2-treatment,  2-period  crossover  analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  model  was  used  to  estimate  the 
geometric mean ratios and their CIs. For each primary endpoint (AUC∞ or Cmax), the model included the 
endpoint on a log-transformed scale as the dependent variable, with treatment, period, and treatment 
sequence as fixed effects, and volunteer as the random effect. The estimation was based on restricted 
maximum likelihood approach. The estimated ratio between treatment groups and the associated 90% 
CI on the original scale were presented and used to establish bioequivalence. The primary analysis model 
assumed that volunteers drop out at random, conditional on the fixed and random effects and was based 
on  the  PK  Population  (volunteers  who  received  both  doses  of  study  treatment  with  sufficient  PK 
measurements to allow calculation of PK parameters).  
As a sensitivity analysis, the above ANOVA analysis was repeated in the Full Analysis (Safety) Population 
(subjects  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  study  treatment  and  had  at  least  1  post-baseline  PK 
measurement)  for  Cmax,  AUC0-∞  and  AUC0-last.  In  addition,  results  of  AUC0-∞  or  Cmax  from  all  study 
volunteers were summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics. 
The primary parameters AUC0-∞ and Cmax were used to establish bioequivalence of the test treatment to 
the  reference treatment.  The  90%  CIs  for  the  ratios  of  geometric  means  between  test  and  reference 
were calculated for AUC0-∞ and Cmax using log-transformed data. The bioequivalence was established if 
the 90% CIs for AUC0-∞ and Cmax were within the range of 80% to 125%. 
The PK parameters including tmax, AUC0-336, AUC0-504, AUC0-last, %AUCextrap, λZ, t1/2, CL/F, and Vd/F 
were  summarized  using  arithmetic  mean,  SD,  CV%,  geometric  mean  and  geometric  CV%,  median, 
minimum, and maximum by treatment group for the PK Population. 
Absorption  
Bioequivalence  
The serum concentration of BIIB017 following singles doses of 125 μg BIIB017 SC or 125 μg BIIB017 
IM were summarised in Table 1 and Table 2 and illustrated in Figure 2. 
The  serum  concentration  versus  time  profiles  after  single  doses  of  125  μg  BIIB017  SC  and  125  μg 
BIIB017 IM were similar, with maximal concentrations reached at a median tmax of 40 hours post-dose 
for SC (range: 11.9 to 312 hours) and 40 hours post-dose for IM (range: 6 to 144 hours) (Table 1). After 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/594296/2020  
Page 18/38 
 
 
 
reaching Cmax, the serum concentrations of BIIB017 declined monophasically, with mean t1/2 values of 
97.1 hours (29.1 to 239.9 hours) for SC and 79.1 hours (26.3 to 233.3 hours) for IM. 
In general, moderate to high between-subject variability was noted for the PK parameters (AUC0-∞, Cmax, 
and AUC0-last) for both routes of administration, with CV% values ranging from 41% to 57% for SC and 
40% to 54% for IM (Table 1). 
Geometric mean values for Cmax and AUC0-∞ seemed slightly higher for IM than SC. However, statistical 
analysis showed that 125 μg BIIB017 SC and 125 μg BIIB017 IM were bioequivalent. Geometric least 
squares mean ratio (90% CI) of IM versus SC was 1.08 (0.98 to 1.20) for Cmax and 1.09 (1.02 to 1.16) 
for AUC0-∞ all contained within the 0.80 to 1.25 equivalence range.  
The  additional  sensitivity  analysis  for  AUC0-∞,  AUC0-last  and  Cmax,  based  on  the  Safety  Population  also 
showed that all 90% CIs of geometric least squares mean ratio (IM versus SC) were contained within 
the 0.80 to 1.25 equivalence range (Table 2).

Methods 
The bioequivalence study described above also had the following exploratory objectives: 
• 
• 
To evaluate PD of SC and IM administration of BIIB017 in healthy volunteers  
To evaluate the immune response to BIIB017 
The  serum  concentration  of  neopterin  following  administration  of  BIIB017  125  μg  IM  and  SC  was 
measured for PD analysis. Derived PD parameters included Ebaseline, EAUC0-336, EAUC0-504, Epeak, and 
ETmax. 
The presence of binding antibodies to PEG and the presence and titre of binding antibodies to IFN ß-1a. 
These samples were collected with the intention of analysing them only in the event of unexpected PK 
or safety findings. 
The  PD  Population  was  defined  as  all  randomized  volunteers  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  study 
treatment with at least 1 PD measurement after baseline. All 136 volunteers were included in the PD 
Population. 
Results 
Demographics 
Seventy-five volunteers were male and 61 were female, all aged between 21 and 55 years. The mean 
weight and BMI of volunteers was similar for each randomized treatment sequence group with a mean 
weight (SD) of 77.3 kg (11.93) and 78.7 kg (12.82), and mean BMI (SD) of 26.9 kg/m2 (2.51) and 26.2 
kg/m2 (2.80) for treatment sequence of IM/SC and SC/IM, respectively. 
Neopterin 
Serum concentrations for neopterin following singles doses of 125 μg BIIB017 SC or 125 μg BIIB017 IM 
are illustrated in Figure 3. A summary of neopterin parameters is presented in Table 3. 
The serum neopterin concentration versus time profiles following single doses of 125 μg BIIB017 SC or 
125  μg  BIIB017  IM  were  similar,  with  maximal  concentrations  (Epeak)  reached  at  a  median  ETmax  of 
40.1 hours and 44.0 hours, respectively. Geometric mean neopterin levels increased from baseline to 
maximum  concentration  similarly  between  the  2  injection  routes,  with  the  increase  from  8.0  to  22.6 
nmol/L for SC, and from 8.1 to 23.2 nmol/L for IM. The overall systemic exposure to neopterin (EAUC0-336 
and EAUC0-504) were also similar between the 2 routes of administration.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Analytical methods 
A statement on the application of appropriate GCP standards in the submitted study was provided by the 
MAH.  Upon  request,  the  MAH  provided  copies  of  the  approval  letter  from  the  Midlands  Independent 
Review Board.  
During the procedure, the MAH  was requested to further clarify the handling and processing of blood 
samples  to  obtain  the  serum.  This  information  was  provided  and  according  to  standard  laboratory 
procedures. 
The MAH was requested to provide the reports for the ELISA used for measuring BIIB017 and neopterin 
levels in serum to confirm the acceptability of the methods. The method validation reports for the ELISA 
used for measuring BIIB017 levels in serum was provided confirming the acceptability of the method. 
The method validation report for the determination of neopterin was also provided. A minor deviation 
from the Guideline on bioanalytical method validation was found but no longer pursued as the analysis 
was done for exploratory purpose only.  
For the ELISA to measure serum BIIB017 levels, stability data until 549 days was provided during the 
procedure and met the required criteria. Hence, the storage period of 212 days of the samples before 
processing was covered by the tested stability data.  
The MAH was requested to clarify the reasons of the 9 samples labelled as “others” that were re-analysed. 
The MAH clarified as follows: the LLOQ was not included in the standard curve in these samples due to 
a %CV or %RE greater than 25%. As a consequence, these samples had a new “LLOQ” which was the 
next upper concentration on the standard curve. In the re-analysis, the samples were analysed using 
the full standard curve in line with the SOP. The clarification is agreed. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Based on the results, the exposure of BIIB017 in serum has been demonstrated to be bioequivalent after 
a single dose administration of 125 μg BIIB017 either via SC or IM. The point estimate ratio and the 
90% CI for AUC0-∞, AUC0-t and Cmax between SC and IM were 1.09, (1.02 – 1.16); 1.13, (1.06 – 1.21); 
and 1.08, (0.98 – 1.20), respectively and were within the acceptance range of 0.80 – 1.25. 
According to the protocol, for the SC injection, 6 subjects were not included in the statistical analysis for 
AUC0-∞ due to poor regression of the elimination phase (n=2) and >20% extrapolation in AUC0-∞ (n=4); 
and 1 subject for the IM injection due to >20% extrapolation in AUC0-∞. Exclusion if AUC0-t covers less 
than  80%  of  AUC0-∞  is  not  according  to  the  Guideline  on  the  investigation  of  bioequivalence,  section 
4.1.8. All subjects should be included. In the sensitivity analysis all subjects were included; hence the

sensitivity  analysis  already  solved  this  issue.  Moreover,  as  this  application  concerns  a  procedure  to 
include a new route of administration, AUC0-last was considered a valid parameter to conclude comparable 
bioavailability between SC and IM route of administration. 
Information about PK profiles of Plegridy following IM vs SC administration was included in a dedicated 
subheading in section 5.2 of the SmPC. 
Pharmacodynamic 
Neopterin  peak  concentrations  (Epeak)  reached  a  level  of  22.6nmol/L  for  SC  and  23.2nmol/L  for  IM 
administration. The Tmax was 40.1hours for SC administration and 44.0hours for IM administration. The 
overall systemic exposures to neopterin were also similar between the 2 routes of administration; EAUC0-
336 geometric mean was 2294h*nmol/L for SC administration and 2399h*nmol/L for IM administration. 
The  EAUC0-504  geometrical  mean  was  2459h*nmol/L  and  2558h*nmol/L  following  SC  and  IM 
administration, respectively. Therefore, the serum concentration profile of neopterin were comparable 
between the two routes of administration. Bioequivalence between the SC and IM route of administration 
could be concluded from a PD perspective. 
Results on ETmax, EAUC0-336h and EAUC0-504h from the PD analysis following the SC and the IM injections 
were included a dedicated subheading in section 5.2 of the SmPC. 
Immunogenicity 
There  were  no  immunogenicity  tests  conducted.  Considering  the  limited  exposure  time,  cross  over 
between route of administration and the low immunogenicity of BIIB017, this is understood. However, 
the route of administration may impact the immunogenicity. A discussion on the impact of the route of 
administration on immunogenicity was provided and included in clinical safety section (see 2.6.1 section).  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The 90% CI for AUC0-∞, AUC0-t and Cmax between SC and IM were within the acceptance range of 0.80 – 
1.25. Overall, bioequivalence was shown between SC and IM administration.  
The  neopterin  peak  concentration  (Epeak),  time  to  neopterin  peak  concentrations  (Tmax)  and  overall 
systemic exposures to neopterin were comparable between the two routes of administration. Thus, the 
serum concentration profile of neopterin were comparable between the two routes of administration and 
bioequivalence between the SC and IM route of administration could be concluded from a PD perspective. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Plegridy received approval in the European Union on the 18th of July 2014. Hence, efficacy of BIIB017 
administered SC is considered established. Bioequivalence of IM and SC administration of BIIB017 was 
assessed in Study 105HV106 (see clinical pharmacology section above). No new clinical efficacy studies 
were conducted to support this extension application.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
As SC and IM administration was shown to be bioequivalent with regard to PK and PD parameters and 
profiles, the efficacy results obtained for SC administration can be extrapolated to IM administration.

2.5.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy of IM injection of Plegridy was considered demonstrated. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The safety population is defined as all volunteers who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of 
study treatment. All 136 volunteers enrolled in Study 105HV106 were included in the safety population. 
ISRs were specifically analysed because of the anticipated decrease of these events in the IM route of 
administration. 
Adverse events 
Throughout the course of the study, every effort was to be made to remain alert to possible adverse 
event  (AEs).  If  an  AE  occurred,  the  first  concern  was  to  be  the  safety of  the  volunteer.  If  necessary, 
appropriate medical intervention was to be provided. 
At  the  signing  of  the  informed  consent  form,  each  volunteer  was  to  have  been  given  the  names  and 
telephone  numbers  of  study  site  staff  for  reporting  AEs  and  medical  emergencies.  Activities  (Version 
21.1) and classified as either pre-treatment AEs or treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) as follows: 
• 
• 
Pre-treatment AEs were events that started prior to the initial dosing of study treatment in the 
study. 
TEAEs were events that increased in severity or that were newly developed during Treatment 
Period  1  or  Treatment  Period  2.  If  an  AE  started  (or  increases  in  severity)  during  a  specific 
Treatment Period, this AE was attributed to the treatment the volunteer was receiving during 
the Treatment Period.  
All analyses of AEs included only TEAEs.  
Overall, there were 92 volunteers that reported at least 1 AE after receiving 125 μg BIIB017 SC and 87 
volunteers  that  reported  at  least  1  AE  after  receiving  125  μg  BIIB017  IM  (Table  4).  All  AEs  were 
considered  resolved  prior  to  the  end  of  study.  There  were  no  SAEs  reported.  Three  volunteers 
discontinued study treatment and were withdrawn from the study due to AEs (Table 4).

The most commonly reported AEs across both treatment periods were headache, chills, pain, injection 
site  pain,  injection  site  erythema,  and  pyrexia.  The  most  frequently  reported  AE  in  volunteers  that 
received BIIB017 SC was headache, which was reported by 55 volunteers. 
Similarly,  47  volunteers  experienced  at  least  1  AE  of  headache  after  receiving  BIIB017  IM.  The  most 
frequently reported AEs in volunteers that received BIIB017 IM were headache and chills, which were 
each reported by 47 volunteers. Comparably, 36 volunteers that received BIIB017 SC reported chills. 
Generalized  pain  was  experienced  by  more  volunteers  that  received  BIIB017  IM,  with  29  volunteers 
reporting at least 1 instance of pain after BIIB017 IM compared to 19 volunteers reporting pain after 
BIIB017 SC. Injection site erythema was experienced by more volunteers that received BIIB017 SC, with 
34 volunteers experiencing at least 1 instance of injection site erythema after BIIB017 SC compared to 
3  volunteers  experiencing  injection  site  erythema  after  BIIB017  IM.  A  similar  number  of  volunteers 
experienced injection site pain across both groups, with 19 volunteers experiencing at least 1 instance 
after  BIIB017  SC  and  15  volunteers  experiencing  after  BIIB017  IM.  A  similar  number  of  volunteers 
reported pyrexia across both groups, with 12 volunteers reporting at least 1 instance after BIIB017 SC 
and 13 volunteers reporting at least 1 instance after BIIB017 IM. 
Analysis by severity  
The Investigator assessed the severity of each AE as mild, moderate, or severe. 
The  majority  of  volunteers  experienced  AEs  that  were  mild  in  severity;  however,  moderate  AEs  were 
recorded  for  5  volunteers  following  administration  of  125  μg  BIIB017  SC  and  4  volunteers  following 
administration  of  125  μg  BIIB017  IM  (Table  4).  The  moderate  AEs  included  headache,  injection  site 
erythema, otitis externa, and presyncope. No severe AEs were reported. 
Analysis by relationship to Study Treatment 
The Investigator assessed the relationship of each AE to study treatment as either related or not related. 
The number of volunteers reporting study treatment-related AEs were similar between treatments. Of 
the 92  volunteers that  had  at  least  1  AE  following administration  of  BIIB017  SC,  89  were  considered 
related to the study treatment, and of the 87 volunteers that had at least 1 AE following administration 
of BIIB017 IM, 81 were considered related to the study treatment (Table 5). 
The study-drug related AE with the highest incidence was headache, with a similar number of volunteers 
reporting  the  AE  after  each  treatment.  Chills  was  the  second  highest  study  drug-related  AE,  with  36 
volunteers reporting at least 1 instance after administration of BIIB017 SC and 46 volunteers reporting 
at least 1 instance after administration of BIIB017 IM. With the exception of 1 AE of injection site pain, 
all ISRs were considered related to the study treatment and there was a higher incidence of volunteers 
reporting ISRs following administration of BIIB017 SC (Table 5). 
With the exception of the AEs of presyncope and otitis externa, all other moderate AEs were considered 
related to the study treatment

Laboratory findings 
Blood chemistry, haematology, and urinalysis samples were collected throughout the study. 
Data for haematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis received from the central laboratory. Out-of-range 
values were flagged in the listings as high (H) or low (L) for haematology and blood chemistry, and as 
‘abnormal’ for urinalysis. For haematology and blood chemistry, shift tables presenting movement in and 
out of reference range from period baseline to each scheduled post-baseline visit were provided for each 
treatment group. Corresponding shift tables (normal versus abnormal) were produced for urinalysis. For 
post-baseline, only data from scheduled visits were included in the summary tables.  
There were no apparent trends in the haematology data for either treatment group. One volunteer was 
withdrawn from the study due to anaemia (Table 6).

Vital Sign Measurement, Physical Examination Findings, and Other 
Observations Related to Safety 
Vital Sign Measurements 
For each treatment group, observed measurements of vital signs (temperature, respiratory rate, pulse, 
systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure) and change from period baseline were summarized 
by visit using descriptive statistics. The abnormalities were consistent between treatment groups. There 
were  no  abnormal  vital  signs  data  that  were  associated  with  any  clinical  symptoms.  There  were  no 
apparent trends in the mean vital signs data for either treatment group. 
Physical Examination Findings & Patients Health Questionnaire (depression module) 
Any  clinically  significant  physical  examination  findings  were  reported  as  AEs  and  presented  in  above 
section. 
The  majority  of  volunteers  responded  “Not  at  all”  to  the  PHQ-9  questions  at  all  timepoints.  Sporadic 
responses other than “Not at all” were recorded, none of which were considered clinically relevant.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Generally, the reported adverse events was comparable between the two routes of administration. The 
SC  administration  has  a  higher  frequency  of  the  following  ISR;  induration,  pruritus,    bruising, 
extravasation, haematoma, oedema and rash, compared to the IM group. However, pain in extremity, 
limb discomfort, muscle spasms, musculoskeletal pain and musculoskeletal stiffness were reported with 
a higher frequency in the IM group compared to the SC group. This is not unexpected, as these AEs are 
all  related  to  the  route  of  administration.  Information  about  commonly  reported  AEs  across  both 
treatment periods together with AEs reported for the SC arm only and the IM arm only were presented 
in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
The  laboratory  test  also  showed  a  comparable  frequency  of  shift  between  the  two  routes  of 
administration. However, urinalysis shows a higher frequency in shift to abnormal values for protein and 
leukocyte esterase following IM administration compared to SC administration. The MAH’s position was 
that differences in urine analysis were not statistically significant and may be chance finding or related 
to the first or midstream catch as the results did not lead to renal adverse events. This rationale is not 
fully agreed as it should be noted that the shift to abnormal is 3 times higher occurred after a single 
administration.  Longer  exposure  may  have  resulted  in  the  occurrence  of  renal  adverse  events.  As  it 
cannot be excluded whether the findings were chance finding, related to the first or midstream catch or 
indeed related to the route of administration, the higher incidence of shift to abnormal was included in 
the section 4.8 of the SmPC as follows: ”Abnormal urine protein was reported in 1/130 (0.8%) for the 
SC  route  of  administration  and  4/131  (3.1%)  in  the  IM  group  without  any  associated  adverse  drug 
reactions”.  
The shift in vital signs occurred with comparable frequency in both routes of administration.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/594296/2020  
Page 30/38 
 
 
 
No immunological tests were performed; however, the route of administration may have an impact on 
the immunogenicity. Therefore, the MAH was requested to discuss the potential impact of the route of 
administration on immunogenicity. The MAH submitted comparative data on immunogenicity following 
SC and IM administration from Minagar et al 2008, Perini et al 2001, Ross et al 2000 and White et al 
2016.  As  these  studies  also  included  immunogenicity  as  an  outcome  measure,  the  duration  is  much 
longer  (6  months  -  3  years)  as  compared  to  the  bioequivalence  study  with  a  range  of  27  days.  This 
allows a valid conclusion on immunogenicity. 
The data from Minagar et al concerned the studies with INF-beta-1a (without PEG) and showed that 19% 
of  the  patients  on  SC  IFN-beta-1a  44  μg  three  times  per  week  tested  positive  for  Nabs  (Neutralizing 
antibodies) at both Month 0 and Month 6, whereas none of those on IM IFN-beta-1a 30 μg once weekly 
were NAbs positive. Perini et al examined the role of dosage, route and frequency of administration of 
clinical grade interferon-beta preparations on immunogenicity. The findings from this study suggest that 
treatment  with  IFN-beta-1a  IM  was  the  least  immunogenic  treatment,  i.e.  INF-beta-1a  was  less 
immunogenic as compared to IFN -beta-1b, and IM administration was less immunogenic compared to 
SC  administration.  In  patients  treated  with  SC  IFN-beta-1b,  NAbs  levels  peaked  3  to  9  months  after 
therapy initiation, and declined to pre-therapy levels in some patients after 3 years. Similar results were 
reported  by  Ross  et  al  2000.  Data  from  White  et  al  2016  included  an  analysis  of  anti-PEG  anti  body 
formation following SC administration at 2 and 4 week interval, to characterise the immunogenic profile 
of the IFN portion and the PEG moiety of PEG-IFN. There was no difference between the PEG antibody 
formation following a 2 week or 4 week treatment interval. The authors concluded that the low incidence 
of immunogenicity, including extremely low frequency of anti-peginterferon NAbs developing at high titre 
levels,  means  that  few  patients  are  at  risk  of  experiencing  impaired  efficacy  during  treatment  with 
peginterferon beta-1a due to immunogenicity. 
These data concern data from other INF-beta-1a products and were therefore considered circumstantial. 
However, it may be concluded that the immunogenicity following the route of administration is the same 
or lower as compared to the SC administration i.e. less than 1%. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile appears to be comparable between the two routes of administration. Some 
adverse  events  occur  more  frequently  in  one  group  compared  to  the  other,  however,  these  adverse 
events are generally related to the IM route of administration.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 5.2 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  MAH  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Plegridy solution for subcutaneous injection in pre-filled 
syringe. The bridging report submitted by the MAH has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Plegridy is an interferon beta-1a with a prolonged response (due to PEG conjugation) indicated in adult 
patients for the treatment of RRMS, the most common phenotype of MS. In MS, an immune-mediated 
inflammatory activity of the CNS leads to destruction of the myelin sheath and axonal injury. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There  is  no  cure  available  for  MS.  Therapies  for  MS  include  treatment  for  relapses,  symptomatic 
treatments and DMD. There are several DMD for MS including other beta interferons (IFN β) (Avonex, 
Betaferon and Rebif) which are available for either SC or IM injection.  
Plegridy is an interferon beta-1a with a prolonged response (due to PEG conjugation). It is indicated in 
adult  patients  for  the  treatment  of  relapsing-remitting  multiple  sclerosis.  The  recommended  dose  of 
Plegridy  is  125 micrograms  injected  SC  every  2 weeks.  The  product  may  be  self-administered  by 
patients. The product is available as a 63, 94 and 125 micrograms strength, both in a pre-filled syringe 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/594296/2020  
Page 33/38 
 
 
 
 
and a pre-filled pen. The lower strengths are used for dose titration at the start of treatment, to prevent 
flu-like symptoms. 
The current application concerns an extension application. The MAH proposes to add IM injection to offer 
patients  an  alternative  route  of  administration  with  fewer  injection  site  reactions  as  compared  to 
subcutaneous injection.  
A new pre-filled syringe has been developed for this purpose. The syringe contains 125 micrograms of 
peginterferon beta-1a. The dose can be limited to 63 micrograms and 94 micrograms with the use of 
titration clips. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical study 
The  development  program  consisted  of  1  open-label,  multicentre,  2-period  crossover  study  with  a 
primary objective of assessing the bioequivalence of BIIB017 administered by SC and IM injection in 136 
healthy  volunteers.  Bioequivalence  was  examined  using  PK  parameters  and  assessing  the  safety  and 
tolerability of SC administration as compared with IM administration of BIIB017 in healthy volunteers. 
Exploratory objectives were to evaluate the PD parameters, i.e. neopterin serum concentration, of SC 
administration  as  compared  with  IM  administration  in  healthy  volunteers.  The  presence  and  titre  of 
binding antibodies to the pegylated and IFN β-1a components of BIIB017 was also to be evaluated in 
case of unusual PK or safety findings. 
The low doses (63 and 94 μg) will be administered by the use of titration clip devices. These titration 
clip devices can administer the required dose (1/2 and 3/4 dose) and are similar to titration clips already 
available for other products.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
AUC0-∞,  AUC0-t  and  Cmax  were  173695  pg/ml/h,  163615  pg/ml/h  and  1459  pg/ml  for  the  SC  route  of 
administration, and 185645pg/ml/h and 180798pg/h and 1517pg/ml for the IM route of administration. 
The point estimate ratio and the 90% CI for AUC0-∞, AUC0-t and Cmax between SC and IM were 1.09 (1.02-
1.16); 1.13 (1.06-1.21); and 1.08 (0.98-1.20), respectively. 
The  time  to  neopterin  peak  concentrations  (Tmax)  was  40.1hours  and  44.0hrs  following  SC  and  IM 
administration,  respectively.  The  neopterin  peak  concentration  (Epeak)  were  22.6nmol/L  for  SC  and 
23.2nmol/L for IM administration. The median overall systemic exposures (EAUC0-504h) to neopterin were 
2546h*nmol/L and 2613h*nmol/L for SC and IM administration, respectively. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are no relevant uncertainties and limitations related to favourable effects. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The following TEAEs were reported with >2% difference between the two routes of administration for 
the SC vs IM respectively: Chills (26.9% vs 34.8%), pain (14.2% vs 22.0%), injection site pain (14.2% 
vs 11.4%), injection sit erythema (25.4% vs 2.3%), headache (38.8% vs 34.8%), dizziness (2.2% vs 
6.1%), backpain (8.2% vs 2.3%). 
Assessment report

The following AEs were reported in the SC treatment arm only: injection site bruising (1.5%), injection 
sit extravasation (0.7%), injection site haematoma (0.7%), injection site oedema (0.7%) and injection 
site rash (1.5%) 
The following AEs were reported in the IM treatment arm only: joint stiffness limb discomfort, muscle 
spasms, musculoskeletal pain, musculoskeletal stiffness. All with a frequency of 0.8%. 
Urinalysis  shows  a  shift  to  abnormal  values  for  protein  for  4/131  (3.1%)  following  IM  administration 
compared to 1/130 (0.8%) following SC administration. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The bioequivalence study was not appropriate to study immunogenicity as it was too short. However, 
circumstantial evidence submitted by the MAH, i.e. data from other INF beta-1a products, shows that 
the immunogenicity following IM administration is lower than that following the SC route.  
It is unclear if the shift to abnormal values for protein is a chance finding, related to the first or midstream 
collection or indeed related to the route of administration.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The active substance is the same for both the IM and SC formulation. The main difference is the route 
of administration. The MAH showed that the point estimates and 90% CI of the PK parameters (AUC0-∞, 
AUC0-t and  Cmax) for  between  SC  and  IM  were  within  the  acceptance  range  of  0.80  –  1.25.  Neopterin 
levels,  a  well-known  PD  marker  for  INF-B,  were  comparable  in  SC  and  IM  administration,  thus 
bioequivalence  between  the  SC  and  IM  route  of  administration  could be  concluded  from  a  PK  and  PD 
perspective.  
The dose of 125μg used in the study was the most appropriate dose to examine the bioequivalence as 
this is the dose required for therapy.  
The  frequency  and  reported  type  of  AE  were  generally  comparable  between  the  two  routes  of 
administration.  There  was  a  higher  frequency  of  ISR  reported  for  the  SC  administration.  IM 
administration let to occurrences of pain in extremity, limb discomfort, muscle spasms, musculoskeletal 
pain and musculoskeletal stiffness. These findings were not unexpected as they are all related to the 
route of administration. Although immunogenicity was not evaluated in the bioequivalence study, the 
MAH provided a literature review supporting that immunogenicity following IM administration is expected 
to  be  lower  than  that  following  the  SC  route.  The  higher  incidence  of  proteinuria  required  an  SmPC 
amendment i.e. “Abnormal urine protein was reported in 1/130 (0.8%) for the SC route of administration 
and 4/131 (3.1%) in the IM administration.”   
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In the present procedure, the MAH has shown PK and PD bioequivalence between Plegridy IM and SC 
administration. Efficacy of IM injection of Plegridy was considered demonstrated.  
No new safety signals were raised. AEs were considered clinically manageable and generally comparable 
between the two routes of administration with fewer ISR as compared to SC injection, which is considered 
a benefit for the patients.  
Therefore, the favourable effects of Plegridy IM outweigh the risks 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable 
3.8.  Conclusions 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the IM administration of Plegridy is considered bioequivalent 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/594296/2020  
Page 36/38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to SC administration of Plegridy. Therefore, a benefit/risk balance comparable to the SC administration 
of Plegridy can be concluded. The overall B/R is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, clinical pharmacology and safety, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the benefit-risk balance of, Plegridy 125 micrograms solution for injection in pre-filled 
syringe for intramuscular use, is favourable in the following indication: 
Plegridy is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.   
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for Plegridy subject to 
the following conditions:

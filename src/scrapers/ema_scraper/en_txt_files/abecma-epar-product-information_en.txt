NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
Abecma 260 - 500 x 106 cells dispersion for infusion 
2. 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
2.1  General description 
Abecma (idecabtagene vicleucel) is a genetically modified autologous immunotherapy consisting of 
human T cells transduced with lentiviral vector (LVV) encoding a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) 
that recognises B-cell maturation antigen. 
2.2  Qualitative and quantitative composition 
Each patient-specific infusion bag of Abecma contains idecabtagene vicleucel cell dispersion at a 
batch-dependent concentration of autologous T cells genetically modified to express an anti-BCMA 
chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-positive viable T cells). The finished product is packaged in one or 
more infusion bags containing a cell dispersion of 260 to 500 x 106 CAR-positive viable T cells. 
Each infusion bag contains 10-30 mL, 30-70 mL or 55-100 mL of dispersion for infusion. 
The cellular composition and the final cell number varies between individual patient batches. In 
addition to T cells, natural killer (NK) cells may be present. The quantitative information regarding the 
number of CAR-positive viable T cells/bag are presented in the release for infusion certificate (RfIC) 
documentation located inside the lid of the dry vapour shipper used for transport.

4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Abecma must be administered in a qualified treatment centre. 
Abecma therapy should be initiated under the direction of and supervised by a healthcare professional 
experienced in the treatment of haematological malignancies and trained for the administration and 
management of patients treated with Abecma. 
A minimum of one dose of tocilizumab for use in the event of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and 
emergency equipment must be available prior to infusion of Abecma. The treatment centre must have 
access to an additional dose of tocilizumab within 8 hours of each previous dose. In the exceptional 
case where tocilizumab is not available due to a shortage that is listed in the European Medicines 
Agency shortage catalogue, suitable alternative measures to treat CRS instead of tocilizumab must be 
available prior to infusion. 
Posology 
Abecma is intended for autologous use only (see section 4.4). Manufacture and release of Abecma 
usually takes about 4-5 weeks. 
Treatment consists of a single dose for infusion containing a dispersion of CAR-positive viable T cells 
in one or more infusion bags. The target dose is 420 x 106 CAR-positive viable T cells within a range 
of 260 to 500 x 106 CAR-positive viable T cells. See the accompanying release for infusion certificate 
(RfIC) for additional information pertaining to dose. 
Pre-treatment (lymphodepleting chemotherapy) 
Lymphodepleting chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) and 
fludarabine 30 mg/m2 IV should be administered for 3 days. See the prescribing information for 
cyclophosphamide and fludarabine for information on dose adjustment in renal impairment.  
Abecma is to be administered 2 days after completion of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, up to a 
maximum of 9 days. The availability of Abecma must be confirmed prior to starting the 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy. If there is a delay of more than 4 weeks between completing 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy and the infusion, then the patient should be re-treated with 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy prior to receiving Abecma. 
Pre-medication 
To minimise the risk of infusion reactions, the patient should be pre-medicated with paracetamol 
(500 to 1,000 mg orally) and diphenhydramine (12.5 mg IV or 25 to 50 mg orally) or another 
H1-antihistamine, approximately 30 to 60 minutes before infusion of Abecma. 
Prophylactic use of systemic corticosteroids should be avoided as the use may interfere with the 
activity of Abecma. Therapeutic doses of corticosteroids should be avoided 72 hours prior to the start 
of lymphodepleting chemotherapy and following Abecma infusion except for the management of 
CRS, neurologic toxicities and other life-threatening emergencies (see section 4.4). 
Clinical assessment prior to infusion 
Abecma treatment should be delayed in some patient groups at risk (see section 4.4). 
Monitoring after infusion 
- 
Patients should be monitored for the first 10 days following infusion at the qualified treatment 
centre for signs and symptoms of CRS, neurologic events and other toxicities. 
After the first 10 days following infusion, the patient should be monitored at the physician’s 
discretion. 
Patients should be instructed to remain within proximity (within 2 hours of travel) of the 
qualified treatment centre for at least 4 weeks following infusion.

Special populations 
Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus 
(HCV) infection 
There is no clinical experience in patients with active HIV, HBV or HCV infection. Screening for 
HBV, active HIV and active HCV must be performed before collection of cells for manufacturing. 
Leukapheresis material from patients with active HIV or active HCV infection will not be accepted for 
Abecma manufacturing (see section 4.4). 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required in patients over 65 years of age (see section 5.1). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Abecma in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Abecma is for intravenous use only. 
Administration 
• 
• 
Do NOT use a leukodepleting filter. 
Ensure that tocilizumab or suitable alternatives, in the exceptional case where tocilizumab is not 
available due to a shortage that is listed in the European Medicines Agency shortage catalogue, 
and emergency equipment are available prior to infusion and during the recovery period. 
Central venous access may be utilised for the infusion of Abecma and is encouraged in patients 
with poor peripheral access. 
Confirm the patient’s identity matches the patient identifiers on the Abecma infusion bag. 
• 
• 
For instructions on preparation, administration, accidental exposure and disposal of the medicinal 
product see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Contraindications of the lymphodepleting chemotherapy must be considered. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
The traceability requirements of cell-based advanced therapy medicinal products must apply. To 
ensure traceability the name of the product, the batch number and the name of the treated patient 
should be kept for a period of 30 years after expiry date of the product. 
Reasons to delay treatment 
Due to the risks associated with Abecma treatment, infusion should be delayed up to 7 days if a patient 
has any of the following conditions: 
• 
Unresolved serious adverse events (especially pulmonary events, cardiac events or hypotension) 
including those after preceding chemotherapies. 
Active infections or inflammatory disorders (including pneumonitis, myocarditis or hepatitis). 
Active graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

Autologous use  
Abecma is intended solely for autologous use and should under no circumstances be administered to 
other patients. Before infusion, the patient's identity must match the patient identifiers on the Abecma 
infusion bag, cassette and the release for infusion certificate (RfIC). Abecma must not be administered 
if the information on the patient-specific label does not match the intended patient. 
Concomitant disease 
Patients with active central nervous system (CNS) disorder or inadequate renal, hepatic, pulmonary or 
cardiac function are likely to be more vulnerable to the consequences of the adverse reactions 
described below and require special attention. 
Central nervous system pathology 
There is no experience of use of Abecma in patients with CNS involvement of myeloma or other pre-
existing, clinically relevant CNS pathologies. 
Prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation 
It is not recommended that patients receive Abecma within 4 months after an allogeneic stem cell 
transplant (SCT) because of the potential risk of Abecma worsening GVHD. Leukapheresis for 
Abecma manufacturing should be performed at least 12 weeks after allogeneic SCT. 
Prior treatment with an anti-BCMA therapy 
There is limited experience with Abecma in patients exposed to prior BCMA-directed therapy. 
There is limited experience of retreating patients with a second dose of Abecma. Responses after 
Abecma retreatment were infrequent and less durable when compared to initial treatment. 
Additionally, fatal outcomes were observed in retreated patients. 
Cytokine release syndrome 
CRS, including fatal or life-threatening reactions occurred following Abecma infusion. Nearly all 
patients experienced some degree of CRS. The median time to onset of CRS was 1 day 
(range: 1 to 12) (see section 4.8). 
Monitoring and management of CRS 
CRS should be identified based on clinical presentation. Patients should be evaluated and treated for 
other causes of fever, hypoxia and hypotension. CRS has been reported to be associated with findings 
of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) and the 
physiology of the syndromes may overlap. MAS is a potentially life-threatening condition, and 
patients should be closely monitored for evidence of MAS. Treatment of MAS should be administered 
per institutional guidelines. 
One dose of tocilizumab per patient must be on-site and available for administration prior to Abecma 
infusion. The treatment centre must have access to an additional dose of tocilizumab within 8 hours of 
each previous dose. In the exceptional case where tocilizumab is not available due to a shortage that is 
listed in the European Medicines Agency shortage catalogue, the treatment centre must have access to 
suitable alternative measures instead of tocilizumab to treat CRS. Patients should be monitored for the 
first 10 days following Abecma infusion at the qualified treatment centre for signs and symptoms of 
CRS. After the first 10 days following infusion, the patient should be monitored at the physician’s 
discretion. Patients should be counselled to remain within proximity (within 2 hours of travel) of the 
qualified treatment centre for at least 4 weeks following infusion and to seek immediate medical 
attention should signs or symptoms of CRS occur at any time. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At the first sign of CRS, treatment with supportive care, tocilizumab or tocilizumab and 
corticosteroids should be instituted, as indicated in Table 1. Abecma can continue to expand and 
persist following administration of tocilizumab and corticosteroids (see section 4.5). 
Patients who experience CRS should be closely monitored for cardiac and organ functioning until 
resolution of symptoms. For severe or life-threatening CRS, intensive care unit level monitoring and 
supportive therapy should be considered. 
If concurrent neurologic toxicity is suspected during CRS, manage the neurologic toxicity according to 
the recommendations in Table 2 and use the more aggressive intervention of the two reactions 
specified in Tables 1 and 2. 
Earlier escalation (i.e. higher corticosteroid dose, alternative anticytokine agents, anti-T cell therapies) 
is recommended in patients with refractory CRS within 72 hours post Abecma infusion characterised 
by persistent fever, end-organ toxicity (e.g. hypoxia, hypotension) and/or HLH/MAS not improving in 
grade within 12 hours of first line interventions.

a Lee et al, 2014. 
Neurologic adverse reactions 
Neurologic toxicities, such as aphasia and encephalopathy, which may be severe or life-threatening, 
occurred following treatment with Abecma. The median time to onset of the first event of 
neurotoxicity was 2 days (range: 1 to 10 days). Grade 3 parkinsonism has also been reported, with 
delayed onset. Neurologic toxicity may occur concurrently with CRS, after CRS resolution or in the 
absence of CRS (see section 4.8). 
Monitoring and management of neurologic toxicities 
Patients should be monitored for the first 10 days following Abecma infusion at the qualified 
treatment centre for signs and symptoms of neurologic toxicities. After the first 10 days following 
infusion, the patient should be monitored at the physician’s discretion. Patients should be counselled to 
remain within proximity (within 2 hours of travel) of the qualified treatment centre for at least 4 weeks 
following infusion and to seek immediate medical attention should signs and symptoms of neurologic 
toxicities occur at any time. 
If neurologic toxicity is suspected, manage according to the recommendations in Table 2. Other causes 
of neurologic symptoms should be ruled out. Intensive care supportive therapy should be provided for 
severe or life-threatening neurologic toxicities. 
If concurrent CRS is suspected during the neurologic toxicity reaction, it should be managed 
according to the recommendations in Table 1 and the more aggressive intervention used for the two 
reactions specified in Tables 1 and 2.

Start non-sedating, antiseizure medicines (e.g. levetiracetam) for seizure 
prophylaxis. 
If 72 hours or more after infusion, observe patient. 
If less than 72 hours after infusion, and symptoms not controlled by supportive 
care alone, consider dexamethasone 10 mg IV every 12 to 24 hours for 2 to 
3 days. 
Start non-sedating, antiseizure medicines (e.g. levetiracetam) for seizure 
prophylaxis. 
Start dexamethasone 10 mg IV every 12 hours for 2 to 3 days or longer for 
persistent symptoms. Consider taper for a total steroid exposure of greater than 
3 days. Steroids are not recommended for isolated Grade 2 headaches. 
If no improvement after 24 hours or worsening of neurologic toxicity, increase 
the dose and/or frequency of dexamethasone up to a maximum of 20 mg IV every 
6 hours. 
Start non-sedating, antiseizure medicines (e.g. levetiracetam) for seizure 
prophylaxis. 
Start dexamethasone 10 to 20 mg IV every 8 to 12 hours. Steroids are not

Prolonged cytopenias 
Patients may exhibit prolonged cytopenias for several weeks following lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy and Abecma infusion (see section 4.8). Blood counts should be monitored prior to and 
after Abecma infusion. Cytopenias should be managed with myeloid growth factor and blood 
transfusion support according to institutional guidelines. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Infections and febrile neutropenia 
Abecma should not be administered to patients with active infections or inflammatory disorders. 
Severe infections, including life-threatening or fatal infections, have occurred in patients after 
receiving Abecma (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection 
before and after Abecma infusion and treated appropriately. Prophylactic, pre-emptive and/or 
therapeutic antimicrobials should be administered according to institutional guidelines. 
Febrile neutropenia was observed in patients after Abecma infusion (see section 4.8) and may be 
concurrent with CRS. In the event of febrile neutropenia, infection should be evaluated and managed 
with broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluids and other supportive care as medically indicated. 
Viral reactivation 
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection resulting in pneumonia and death have occurred following Abecma 
administration (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored and treated for CMV infection 
according to clinical guidelines. 
HBV reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure and death, can occur 
in patients treated with medicinal products directed against plasma cells (see section 4.8). 
Screening for CMV, HBV, active HIV and active HCV must be performed before collection of cells 
for manufacturing (see section 4.2). 
Hypogammaglobulinaemia 
Plasma cell aplasia and hypogammaglobulinaemia can occur in patients receiving treatment with 
Abecma (see section 4.8). Immunoglobulin levels should be monitored after treatment with Abecma 
and managed per institutional guidelines including infection precautions, antibiotic or antiviral 
prophylaxis and immunoglobulin replacement. 
Secondary malignancies 
Patients treated with Abecma may develop secondary malignancies. Patients should be monitored life-
long for secondary malignancies. In the event that a secondary malignancy of T cell origin occurs, the 
company should be contacted to obtain instructions on the collection of patient samples for testing. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Allergic reactions may occur with the infusion of Abecma. Serious hypersensitivity reactions, 
including anaphylaxis, may be due to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), an excipient in Abecma. Patients 
not previously exposed to DMSO should be observed closely. Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, 
and oxygen saturation) and the occurrence of any symptom should be monitored prior to the start of 
the infusion, approximately every ten minutes during the infusion and every hour, for 3 hours, after the 
infusion. 
Interference with serological testing 
HIV and the lentivirus used to make Abecma have limited, short spans of identical genetic material 
(RNA). Therefore, some commercial HIV nucleic acid tests may yield false-positive results in patients 
who have received Abecma. 
Blood, organ, tissue and cell donation 
Patients treated with Abecma should not donate blood, organs, tissues and cells for transplantation.

Long-term follow-up 
Patients are expected to be enrolled in a registry and will be followed in the registry in order to better 
understand the long-term safety and efficacy of Abecma. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains up to 33 mmol (752 mg) sodium per dose, equivalent to 37.6% of the 
WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
This medicinal product contains up to 7 mmol (274 mg) potassium per dose. To be taken into 
consideration by patients with reduced kidney function or patients on a controlled potassium diet. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
The co-administration of agents known to inhibit T cell function has not been formally studied. The 
co-administration of agents known to stimulate T cell function has not been investigated and the 
effects are unknown. 
Tocilizumab and corticosteroid use 
Some patients required tocilizumab and/or corticosteroid for the management of CRS (see 
section 4.8). The use of tocilizumab and/or steroids for CRS management was more common in 
patients with higher cellular expansion. 
Patients with CRS treated with tocilizumab had higher Abecma cellular expansion levels, as measured 
by 1.4-fold and 1.6-fold higher median Cmax (N = 66) and AUC0-28days (N = 65), respectively, compared 
to patients who did not receive tocilizumab (N = 61 for Cmax and N = 60 for AUC0-28days). Similarly, 
patients with CRS treated with corticosteroids had higher Abecma cellular expansion levels, as 
measured by 1.7-fold and 2.2-fold higher median Cmax (N = 18) and AUC0-28days (N = 18), respectively, 
compared to patients who did not receive corticosteroids (N = 109 for Cmax and N = 107 for 
AUC0-28days). 
Live vaccines 
The safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines during or following Abecma treatment has not 
been studied. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 6 weeks prior to the 
start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during Abecma treatment and until immune recovery 
following treatment with Abecma. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females 
Pregnancy status for women of childbearing potential should be verified using a pregnancy test prior 
to starting treatment with Abecma. 
See the prescribing information for fludarabine and cyclophosphamide for information on the need for 
effective contraception in patients who receive the lymphodepleting chemotherapy. 
There are insufficient exposure data to provide a recommendation concerning duration of 
contraception following treatment with Abecma. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of idecabtagene vicleucel in pregnant women. No animal reproductive 
and developmental toxicity studies have been conducted with idecabtagene vicleucel to assess whether 
it can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see section 5.3). 
It is not known if idecabtagene vicleucel has the potential to be transferred to the foetus. Based on the 
mechanism of action, if the transduced cells cross the placenta, they may cause foetal toxicity, 
including plasma cell aplasia or hypogammaglobulinaemia. Therefore, Abecma is not recommended 
for women who are pregnant or for women of childbearing potential not using contraception. Pregnant 
women should be advised on the potential risks to the foetus. Pregnancy after Abecma therapy should 
be discussed with the treating physician. 
Assessment of immunoglobulin levels in newborn infants of mothers treated with Abecma should be 
considered. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether idecabtagene vicleucel cells are excreted in human milk or transferred to the 
breast-feeding child. A risk to the breast-fed infant cannot be excluded. Women who are breast-
feeding should be advised of the potential risk to the breast-fed child. 
Fertility 
There are no data on the effect of idecabtagene vicleucel on fertility. Effects of idecabtagene vicleucel 
on male and female fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Abecma may have major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Due to the potential for neurologic adverse reactions, including altered mental status or seizures with 
Abecma, patients receiving Abecma should refrain from driving or operating heavy or potentially 
dangerous machines for at least 8 weeks after Abecma infusion or until resolution of neurologic 
adverse reactions. 
4.8  Undesirable effects

adverse reactions reported within the first 8 weeks after infusion were neutropenia (87.0%), 
anaemia (56.0%), thrombocytopenia (48.4%), leucopenia (44.0%) lymphopenia (27.7%) and 
hypophosphataemia (16.3%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Table 3 summarises the adverse reactions observed in 128 and 56 patients treated with Abecma across 
the target dose levels of 150 to 450 x 106 CAR-positive T cells (see Table 4 in section 5.1 for the 
corresponding dose range of CAR-positive viable T cells) in the KarMMa and CRB-401 studies, 
respectively. Adverse reactions are presented by MedDRA system organ class and by frequency. 
Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon 
(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot 
be estimated from available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in 
order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Cytokine release syndrome 
In the pooled studies (KarMMa and CRB-401), CRS occurred in 81.0% of patients receiving Abecma. 
Grade 3 or higher CRS (Lee et al, 2014) occurred in 5.4% of patients, with fatal (Grade 5) CRS 
reported in 0.5% of patients. The median time-to-onset, any grade, was 1 day (range: 1 to 17) and the 
median duration of CRS was 5 days (range: 1 to 63). 
13 
 
 
 
The most common manifestations of CRS included pyrexia (78.3%), hypotension (32.1%), 
tachycardia (25.5%), chills (23.4%), hypoxia (16.3%), C-reactive protein increased (16.3%), headache 
(14.7%) and fatigue (10.9%). Grade 3 or higher events that may be observed in association with CRS 
included atrial fibrillation, capillary leak syndrome, hypotension, hypoxia and HLH/MAS. 
Of the 184 patients, 45.1% of patients received tocilizumab; 32.6% received a single dose while 
12.5% received more than 1 dose of tocilizumab for treatment of CRS. Overall, across the target dose 
levels, 15.8% of patients received at least 1 dose of corticosteroids for treatment of CRS. Of the 
92 patients, at the target dose of 450 x 106 CAR-positive T cells, 54.3% of patients received 
tocilizumab and 22.8% received at least 1 dose of corticosteroids for treatment of CRS. See section 4.4 
for monitoring and management guidance. 
Neurologic adverse reactions 
In the pooled studies, of the 184 patients, independent of investigator attribution of neurotoxicity, the 
most frequent neurologic or psychiatric adverse reactions included headache (28.8%), dizziness 
(15.2%), confusional state (13.0%), insomnia (9.8%), anxiety (8.2%), tremor (8.2%), and somnolence 
(6.5%). Other neurological adverse reactions occurring at a lower frequency and considered clinically 
important included aphasia (4.3%) and encephalopathy (4.3%). Neurotoxicity identified by the 
investigators, which was the primary method of assessing CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity in the 
KarMMa study only, occurred in 18.0% of the 128 patients receiving Abecma, including Grade 3 in 
3.1% of patients (with no Grade 4 or 5 events). The median time to onset of the first event was 2 days 
(range: 1 to 10). The median duration was 3 days (range: 1 to 26). Overall, 7.8% of patients received 
at least 1 dose of corticosteroid for treatment of CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity, while at the 
target dose of 450 x 106 CAR-positive T cells, 14.8% of patients received at least 1 dose of 
corticosteroids. The most common manifestations of investigator identified neurotoxicity included 
confusional state (9.4%), encephalopathy (5.5%), aphasia (4.7%), hallucination (3.1%), and mental 
status changes (3.1%). See section 4.4 for monitoring and management guidance. 
Febrile neutropenia and infections 
In the pooled studies, infections occurred in 71.2% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 infections occurred in 
23.4% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 infections with an unspecified pathogen occurred in 17.9%, viral 
infections in 7.1%, bacterial infections in 3.8% and fungal infections in 0.5% of patients. Fatal 
infections of unspecified pathogen were reported in 1.6 % of patients and 0.5% of patients had fatal 
fungal or viral infection. See section 4.4 for monitoring and management guidance. 
Febrile neutropenia (Grade 3 or 4) was observed in 14.7% of patients after Abecma infusion. Febrile 
neutropenia may be concurrent with CRS. See section 4.4 for monitoring and management guidance. 
Prolonged cytopenia 
Patients may exhibit prolonged cytopenias following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and Abecma 
infusion. In the pooled studies, 34.8% of the 178 patients who had Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and 
72.7% of the 110 patients who had Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia during the first month following 
Abecma infusion had not resolved by last assessment during the first month. Among the 62 patients 
with neutropenia not resolved by month 1, 82.3% recovered from Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia with a 
median time to recovery from Abecma infusion of 1.9 months. Of the 80 patients with 
thrombocytopenia not resolved by month 1, 71.3% recovered from Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia 
with the median time to recovery of 2.2 months. See section 4.4 for monitoring and management 
guidance. 
Hypogammaglobulinaemia 
Hypogammaglobulinaemia was reported in 19.6% of patients treated with Abecma in the pooled 
studies with a median time to onset of 100 days (range 15 to 326). See section 4.4 for monitoring and 
management guidance. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Immunogenicity 
Abecma has the potential to induce anti-CAR antibodies. In clinical studies, humoral immunogenicity 
of Abecma was measured by determination of anti-CAR antibody in serum pre- and post-
administration. In the pooled studies, 4.3% of patients tested positive for pre-infusion anti-CAR 
antibodies and post-infusion anti-CAR antibodies were detected in 50.5% of the patients. There is no 
evidence that the presence of pre-existing or post-infusion anti-CAR antibodies impact the cellular 
expansion, safety or effectiveness of Abecma. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There are limited data regarding overdose with Abecma. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: not yet assigned, ATC code: not yet assigned 
Mechanism of action 
Abecma is a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-positive T cell therapy targeting B-cell maturation 
antigen (BCMA), which is expressed on the surface of normal and malignant plasma cells. The CAR 
construct includes an anti-BCMA scFv-targeting domain for antigen specificity, a transmembrane 
domain, a CD3-zeta T cell activation domain, and a 4-1BB costimulatory domain. Antigen-specific 
activation of Abecma results in CAR-positive T cell proliferation, cytokine secretion and subsequent 
cytolytic killing of BCMA-expressing cells. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
KarMMa was an open-label, single-arm, multicentre study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of 
Abecma in adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who had received at least 
3 prior antimyeloma therapies including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an 
anti-CD38 antibody and who were refractory to the last treatment regimen. Patients with CNS 
involvement of myeloma, a history of other BCMA targeting therapies, allogeneic SCT or prior gene 
therapy based or other genetically modified T cell therapy were excluded. Patients with a history of 
CNS disorders (such as seizures), inadequate hepatic, renal, bone marrow function, cardiac, 
pulmonary function or ongoing treatment with immunosuppressants were excluded. 
The study consisted of pre-treatment (screening, leukapheresis and bridging therapy [if needed]); 
treatment (lymphodepleting chemotherapy and Abecma infusion); and posttreatment (ongoing) for a 
minimum of 24 months following Abecma infusion or until documented disease progression, 
whichever was longer. The lymphodepleting chemotherapy period was one 3-day cycle of 
cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m2 IV infusion daily for 3 days) and fludarabine (30 mg/m2 IV infusion 
daily for 3 days) starting 5 days prior to the target infusion date of Abecma. Patients were hospitalised 
for 14 days after infusion of Abecma to monitor and manage potential CRS and neurotoxicity. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Of the 140 patients who were enrolled (i.e. underwent leukapheresis), 128 patients received the 
Abecma infusion. Out of the 140 patients, only one did not receive the product due to manufacturing 
failure. Eleven other patients were not treated with Abecma, due to physician decision (n = 3), patient 
withdrawal (n = 4), adverse events (n = 1), progressive disease (n = 1) or death (n = 2) prior to 
receiving Abecma. 
Anticancer therapy for disease control (bridging) was permitted between apheresis and 
lymphodepletion with the last dose being administered at least 14 days prior to initiation of 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Of the 128 patients treated with Abecma, most patients (87.5%) 
received anticancer therapy for disease control at the discretion of the investigator. 
The doses targeted in the clinical study were 150, 300 or 450 x 106 CAR-positive T cells per infusion. 
The allowed dose range was 150 to 540 x 106 CAR-positive T cells. Table 4 below shows the target 
dose levels used in the clinical study based on total CAR-positive T cells and the corresponding range 
of actual dose administered defined as CAR-positive viable T cells.

f  Triple refractory is defined as refractory to an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 
antibody. 
The median time from leukapheresis to product availability was 32 days (range: 24 to 55 days) and the 
median time from leukapheresis to infusion was 40 days (range: 33 to 79 days). The median actual 
dose received across all doses targeted in the clinical study was 315.3 x 106 CAR-positive T cells 
(range 150.5 to 518.4). 
Efficacy was assessed on the basis of overall response rate (ORR), complete response (CR) rate and 
duration of response (DOR), as determined by an independent review committee. Other efficacy 
endpoints included minimal residual disease (MRD) using next-generation sequencing (NGS). 
Efficacy results across doses targeted in the clinical study (150 to 450 x 106 CAR-positive T cells) are 
shown in the Table 6. Median follow-up was 19.9 months for all Abecma treated patients.

Special populations 
Elderly 
In the clinical trial of Abecma, 48 (34.3%) patients in the KarMMa study were 65 years of age or older 
and 5 (3.6%) were 75 years of age or older (see Table 5). No clinically important differences in the 
safety or effectiveness of Abecma were observed between these patients and patients younger than 
65 years of age. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Abecma in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of mature B-cell neoplasms (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
This medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called ‘conditional approval scheme’. This 
means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. 
The European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every 
year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Following Abecma infusion, the CAR-positive T cells proliferate and undergo rapid multi-log 
expansion followed by a bi-exponential decline. The median time of maximal expansion in peripheral 
blood (Tmax) occurred 11 days after infusion. 
Abecma can persist in peripheral blood for up to 1 year post-infusion. 
Abecma transgene levels were positively associated with objective tumour response (partial response 
or better). The median Cmax levels in responders (N = 93) were approximately 4.5-fold higher 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
compared to the corresponding levels in non-responders (N = 34). Median AUC0-28days in responding 
patients (N = 93) was approximately 5.5-fold higher than non-responders (N = 32). 
Special populations 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
Hepatic and renal impairment studies of Abecma were not conducted. 
Effects of age, weight, gender or race 
Age (range: 33 to 78 years) had no impact on Abecma expansion parameters. The pharmacokinetics of 
Abecma in patients less than 18 years of age have not been evaluated. 
Patients with lower body weight had higher cellular expansion. Due to high variability in 
pharmacokinetic cellular expansion, the overall effect of weight on the expanison parameters of 
Abecma is considered not to be clinically relevant. 
Gender had no impact on Abecma expansion parameters. 
Race and ethnicity had no significant impact on Abecma expansion parameters. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Abecma comprises engineered human T cells, therefore there are no representative in vitro assays, 
ex vivo models, or in vivo models that can accurately address the toxicological characteristics of the 
human product. Hence, traditional toxicology studies used for drug development were not performed. 
Genotoxicity assays and carcinogenicity studies were not conducted. 
In vitro expansion studies from healthy donors and patients showed no evidence for transformation 
and/or immortalisation and no preferential integration near genes of concern in Abecma T cells. 
Given the nature of the product, non-clinical studies on fertility, reproduction and development were 
not conducted.

20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6.4  Special precautions for storage 
Store and transport frozen in the vapour phase of liquid nitrogen (≤ -130°C) and must remain frozen 
until the patient is ready for treatment to ensure viable live autologous cells are available for patient 
administration. Product must NOT be refrozen following thaw. 
For storage conditions after thawing of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. 
6.5  Nature and contents of container 
Ethylene vinyl acetate cryopreservation bag(s) with sealed addition tube containing 10-30 mL (50 mL 
bag), 30-70 mL (250 mL bag) or 55-100 mL (500 mL bag) of cell dispersion. 
Each cryopreservation bag is individually packed in a metal cassette. 
One individual treatment dose is comprised of one or more infusion bags of the same size and fill 
volume. 
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product 
Abecma should be transported within the treatment centre in closed, break-proof, leak-proof 
containers. 
This medicinal product contains human blood cells. Healthcare professionals handling Abecma should 
take appropriate precautions (wearing gloves and glasses) to avoid potential transmission of infectious 
diseases. 
Preparation prior to administration 
Prior to Abecma infusion, it must be confirmed that the patient’s identity matches the patient 
identifiers on the Abecma cassette(s), the infusion bag(s) and the release for infusion certificate 
(RfIC). The Abecma infusion bag must not be removed from the cassette if the information on the 
patient-specific label does not match the intended patient. The company must be contacted 
immediately if there are any discrepancies between the labels and the patient identifiers. 
If more than one infusion bag has been received for treatment, thaw each infusion bag one at a time. 
The timing of thaw of Abecma and infusion should be coordinated. The infusion start time should be 
confirmed in advance and adjusted for thaw so that Abecma is available for infusion when the patient 
is ready. 
Thawing 
• 
• 
• 
Remove the Abecma infusion bag from the cassette and inspect the infusion bag for any 
breaches of container integrity such as breaks or cracks before thawing. If the infusion bag 
appears to have been damaged or to be leaking, it should not be infused and should be disposed 
of according to local guidelines on handling of waste of human-derived material. 
Place the infusion bag inside a second sterile bag. 
Thaw Abecma at approximately 37°C using an approved thaw device or water bath until there is 
no visible ice in the infusion bag. Gently mix the contents of the bag to disperse clumps of 
cellular material. If visible cell clumps remain, continue to gently mix the contents of the bag. 
Small clumps of cellular material should disperse with gentle manual mixing. Do not wash, spin 
down and/or resuspend Abecma in new media prior to infusion.

Abecma administration 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Prime the tubing of the infusion set with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection 
prior to infusion. 
Infuse Abecma within 1 hour from start of thaw as quickly as tolerated by gravity flow. 
After the entire content of the infusion bag is infused, rinse the tubing with sodium chloride 
9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection at the same infusion rate to ensure all product is 
delivered. 
Follow the same procedure for all subsequent infusion bags for the identified patient. 
Precautions to be taken for disposal of the medicinal product 
Unused medicinal product and all material that has been in contact with Abecma (solid and liquid 
waste) should be handled and disposed of as potentially infectious waste in accordance with local 
guidelines on handling of human-derived material. 
Accidental exposure  
In case of accidental exposure local guidelines on handling of human-derived material should be 
followed. Work surfaces and materials which have potentially been in contact with Abecma must be 
decontaminated with appropriate disinfectant.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Abecma is and what it is used for 
What Abecma is 
Abecma is a type of medicine called a ‘genetically modified cell therapy’. The active substance in the 
medicine is idecabtagene vicleucel, which is made from your own white blood cells, called T cells. 
What Abecma is used for 
Abecma is used to treat adults with multiple myeloma, which is a cancer of the bone marrow. 
It is given when previous treatments for your cancer have not worked or the cancer has come back. 
How Abecma works 
The white blood cells are taken from your blood and are genetically modified so that they can target 
the myeloma cells in your body. 
When Abecma is infused into your blood, the modified white blood cells will kill the myeloma cells. 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Abecma 
You should not be given Abecma 
• 
if you are allergic to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). If you 
think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. 
if you are allergic to any of the ingredients in the medicines you will be given for 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy, which is used to prepare your body for Abecma treatment.

Warnings and precautions 
Before you are given Abecma you should tell your doctor if 
• 
• 
• 
• 
you have any lung or heart problems. 
you have low blood pressure. 
you have had a stem cell transplant in the last 4 months. 
you have signs or symptoms of graft-versus-host disease. This happens when transplanted cells 
attack your body, causing symptoms such as rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and bloody 
stools. 
you have an infection. The infection will be treated before you are given Abecma. 
you notice the symptoms of your cancer getting worse. In myeloma these might include fever, 
feeling weak, bone pain, unexplained weight loss. 
you have had cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, hepatitis B or C or human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) infection. 
you have had a vaccination in the previous 6 weeks or are planning to have one in the next few 
months. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor before being given Abecma. 
Tests and checks 
Before you are given Abecma your doctor will: 
• 
Check your lungs, heart and blood pressure. 
• 
Look for signs of infection; any infection will be treated before you are given Abecma. 
• 
Check if your cancer is getting worse. 
• 
Check for CMV infection, hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV infection. 
After you have been given Abecma 
• 
There are serious side effects which you need to tell your doctor or nurse about straight away 
and which may require you to get immediate medical attention. See section 4 under ‘Serious 
side effects’. 
Your doctor will regularly check your blood counts as the number of blood cells may decrease. 
Stay close to the treatment centre where you had Abecma for at least 4 weeks. See sections 3 
and 4. 
Do not donate blood, organs, tissues or cells for transplantation. 
•

Children and adolescents 
Abecma should not be given to children and adolescents below 18 years of age. 
Other medicines and Abecma 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, 
including medicines obtained without a prescription. 
Medicines that affect your immune system 
Before you are given Abecma, tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking any medicines that weaken 
your immune system such as corticosteroids. This is because these medicines may interfere with the 
effect of Abecma. 
See section 3 for information about the medicines you will be given before having Abecma. 
Vaccinations 
You must not be given certain vaccines called live vaccines: 
• 
in the 6 weeks before you are given a short course of chemotherapy (called lympodepleting 
chemotherapy) to prepare your body for Abecma. 
during Abecma treatment. 
after treatment while the immune system is recovering. 
• 
• 
Talk to your doctor if you need to have any vaccinations.

Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before being given this medicine. This is because the effects of Abecma in 
pregnant or breast-feeding women are not known and it may harm your unborn baby or breast-fed 
child. 
• 
If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant after treatment with Abecma, talk to your 
doctor immediately. 
You will be given a pregnancy test before treatment starts. Abecma should only be given if the 
results show you are not pregnant. 
• 
Discuss pregnancy with your doctor if you have received Abecma. 
Driving and using machines 
Do not drive, use machines or take part in activities that need you to be alert for at least 8 weeks after 
treatment or until your doctor tells you that you have completely recovered. Abecma may make you 
feel sleepy, may cause confusion or fits (seizures). 
Abecma contains sodium, potassium and dimethly sulfoxide (DMSO) 
This medicine contains up to 752 mg sodium (main component of cooking/ table salt) per dose. This is 
equivalent to 37.6% of the recommended maximum daily intake of sodium for an adult. 
This medicine contains up to 274 mg potassium per dose. To be taken into consideration by patients 
with reduced kidney function or patients on a controlled potassium diet. 
If you have not been previously exposed to DMSO you should be observed closely during the first 
minutes of the infusion period.

How Abecma is given 
Giving blood to make Abecma from your white blood cells 
• 
Your doctor will take some of your blood using a tube (catheter) in your vein. Some of your 
white blood cells will be separated from your blood and the rest of your blood is returned to 
your body. This is called ‘leukapheresis’ and can take 3 to 6 hours. This process may need to be 
repeated. 
Your white blood cells will then be frozen and sent away to make Abecma. 
Other medicines you will be given before Abecma 
• 
A few days before you receive Abecma, you will be given a short course of chemotherapy. This 
is to clear away your existing white blood cells. 
Shortly before you receive Abecma, you will be given paracetamol and an antihistamine 
medicine. This is to reduce the risk of infusion reactions and fever. 
How Abecma is given 
• 
Your doctor will check that the Abecma was prepared from your own blood by checking the 
patient identity information on the medicine labels matches your details. 
Abecma is given as an infusion drip through a tube into your vein. 
After Abecma is given 
• 
• 
Stay close to the treatment centre where you received Abecma - for at least 4 weeks. 
You may be monitored daily in the treatment centre for at least 10 days to check if your 
treatment is working - and help you if you have any side effects. See sections 2 and 4. 
Do not donate blood, organs, tissues or cells for transplantation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
It is important that you read the entire content of this procedure prior to administering Abecma. 
Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product 
• 
Abecma should be transported within the treatment centre in closed, break-proof, leak-proof 
containers. 
This medicinal product contains human blood cells. Healthcare professionals handling Abecma 
should take appropriate precautions (wearing gloves and glasses) to avoid potential transmission 
of infectious diseases. 
• 
Preparation prior to administration 
• 
Prior to Abecma infusion, it must be confirmed that the patient’s identity matches the patient 
identifiers on the Abecma cassette(s), the infusion bag(s) and the release for infusion certificate 
(RfIC). 
The Abecma infusion bag must not be removed from the cassette if the information on the 
patient-specific label does not match the intended patient. The company must be contacted 
immediately if there are any discrepancies between the labels and the patient identifiers. 
If more than one infusion bag has been received for treatment, thaw each infusion bag one at a 
time. The timing of thaw of Abecma and infusion should be coordinated. The infusion start time 
should be confirmed in advance and adjusted for thaw so that Abecma is available for infusion 
when the patient is ready. 
Remove the Abecma infusion bag from the cassette and inspect the infusion bag for any 
breaches of container integrity such as breaks or cracks before thawing. If the infusion bag 
appears to have been damaged or to be leaking, it should not be infused and should be disposed 
of according to local guidelines on handling of waste of human-derived material. 
Place the infusion bag inside a second sterile bag. 
Thaw Abecma at approximately 37°C using an approved thaw device or water bath until there is 
no visible ice in the infusion bag. Gently mix the contents of the bag to disperse clumps of 
cellular material. If visible cell clumps remain, continue to gently mix the contents of the bag. 
Small clumps of cellular material should disperse with gentle manual mixing. Do not wash, spin 
down and/or resuspend Abecma in new media prior to infusion.

Intravenous infusion of Abecma should only be administered by a healthcare professional 
experienced with immunosuppressed patients and prepared to manage anaphylaxis. 
Ensure that tocilizumab and emergency equipment are available prior to infusion and during the 
recovery period. In the exceptional case where tocilizumab is not available due to a shortage 
that is listed in the European Medicines Agency shortage catalogue, ensure that suitable 
alternative measures to treat CRS instead of tocilizumab are available on-site. 
Central venous access may be utilised for the infusion of Abecma and is encouraged in patients 
with poor peripheral access. 
Confirm the patient’s identity matches the patient identifiers on the Abecma infusion bag. 
Prime the tubing of the infusion set with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection 
prior to infusion. 
Infuse Abecma within 1 hour from start of thaw as quickly as tolerated by gravity flow. 
After the entire content of the infusion bag is infused, rinse the tubing with sodium chloride 
9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection at the same infusion rate to ensure all product is 
delivered. 
Follow the same procedure for all subsequent infusion bags for the identified patient. 
Disposal of Abecma 
• 
Unused medicinal product and all material that has been in contact with Abecma (solid and 
liquid waste) should be handled and disposed of as potentially infectious waste in accordance 
with local guidelines on handling of human-derived material. 
Accidental exposure 
• 
In case of accidental exposure local guidelines on handling of human-derived material should be 
followed. Work surfaces and materials which have potentially been in contact with Abecma 
must be decontaminated with appropriate disinfectant.

SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR THE VARIATION TO THE TERMS

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for idecabtagene vicleucel, the 
scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows: 
Considering the totality of data submitted with the cumulative review for the parkinsonism, there is at 
least a reasonable possibility for causality between Abecma and parkinsonism, based on plausible 
mechanism of action and one case from the Abecma clinical trial (BB2121-MM-002) with grade 3 
parkinsonism concurrent with other symptoms for neurotoxicity on Day18 that is considered relevant. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for idecabtagene vicleucel the CHMP is of the opinion that 
the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing idecabtagene vicleucel is unchanged 
subject to the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

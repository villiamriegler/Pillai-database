Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
DuoResp Spiromax 
budesonide / formoterol 
On 22 April 2021, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
DuoResp Spiromax. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Teva Pharma B.V.. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to the existing indication as follows:2 
Asthma  
DuoResp Spiromax is indicated in adults and adolescents (12 years and older) for the regular 
treatment of asthma, where use of a combination (inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2 
adrenoceptor agonist) is appropriate: 
-in patients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and “as needed” inhaled short-
acting β2 adrenoceptor agonists. 
or 
-in patients already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β2 
adrenoceptor agonists. 
COPD 
DuoResp Spiromax is indicated in adults, aged 18 years and older for the symptomatic treatment 
of patients with COPD with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) < 70% predicted normal 
(post bronchodilator) and a history of repeated exacerbations, who have significant symptoms 
despite regular therapy with long-acting bronchodilators. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission. 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be issued 67 
days from adoption of the opinion

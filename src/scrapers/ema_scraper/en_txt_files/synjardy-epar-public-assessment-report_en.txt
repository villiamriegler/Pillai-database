2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Empagliflozin 
The applicant developed empagliflozin as adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in 
adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus either as monotherapy or as add-on to other oral antidiabetic 
treatments including insulin. Empagliflozin is formulated as a tablet for oral administration and the 
recommended doses are 10 mg and 25mg once daily. The clinical development of empagliflozin 
started in January 2007. The clinical program that formed the basis for the initial application of 
empagliflozin as monotherapy comprised 30 phase I trials, 5 phase II trials, and 13 phase IIb/III trials. 
These studies established the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy profiles of empagliflozin. 
Assessment report  
EMA/238334/2015 
Page 6/99 
  
  
Empagliflozin was authorised in the EU as Jardiance in May 2014 (European Public Assessment Report: 
http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Public_assessment_report/hum
an/002677/WC500168594.pdf) 
Empagliflozin is a reversible, highly potent (IC50 of 1.3 nmol) and selective competitive inhibitor of 
SGLT2. Empagliflozin does not inhibit other glucose transporters important for glucose transport into 
peripheral tissues and is 5000 times more selective for SGLT2 versus SGLT1, the major transporter 
responsible for glucose absorption in the gut. SGLT2 is highly expressed in the kidney, whereas 
expression in other tissues is absent or very low. It is responsible, as the predominant transporter, for 
the reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the circulation. In patients with 
type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and hyperglycaemia a higher amount of glucose is filtered and reabsorbed. 
Empagliflozin improves glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes by reducing renal glucose 
reabsorption. The amount of glucose removed by the kidney through this glucuretic mechanism is 
dependent on blood glucose concentration and GFR. Inhibition of SGLT2 in patients with T2DM and 
hyperglycaemia leads to excess glucose excretion in the urine. In patients with T2DM, urinary glucose 
excretion increased immediately following the first dose of empagliflozin and is continuous over the 24 
hour dosing interval. Increased urinary glucose excretion was maintained at the end of the 4-week 
treatment period, averaging approximately 78 g/day with empagliflozin 25 mg. Increased urinary 
glucose excretion resulted in an immediate reduction in plasma glucose levels in patients with type 2 
diabetes. Empagliflozin improves both fasting and post-prandial plasma glucose levels. The 
mechanism of action of empagliflozin is independent of beta cell function and insulin pathway and this 
contributes to a low risk of hypoglycaemia. Improvement of surrogate markers of beta cell function 
including Homeostasis Model Assessment-β (HOMA-β) was noted. In addition, urinary glucose 
excretion triggers calorie loss, associated with body fat loss and body weight reduction. The 
glucosuria observed with empagliflozin is accompanied by mild diuresis which may contribute to 
sustained and moderate reduction of blood pressure. 
Metformin 
Pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of metformin are well established and are described in the 
current Summary of Product Characteristics (Glucophage; November, 2011). Metformin is described 
chemically as N,N-dimethylimidodicarbonimidic diamide hydrochloride. 
Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and 
improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. 
Empagliflozin/metformin FDC 
A total of six dose strengths have been developed for the empagliflozin/metformin FDC: 5/500 mg, 
5/850 mg, 5/1000 mg, 12.5/500 mg, 12.5/850 mg, and 12.5/1000 mg twice-daily. The 
empagliflozin/metformin FDC tablet formulation was not used in any phase II/III clinical studies 
included in the evaluation of efficacy and safety in the current application. However, bioequivalence of 
the proposed commercial FDC tablets and the corresponding dose of free combination tablets 
(considering the twice daily posology) has been demonstrated for all intended dose strengths of the 
FDC in three pivotal bioequivalence studies. 
The metformin used in clinical studies demonstrating the efficacy and safety of the combination of 
empagliflozin and metformin included US-sourced and EU-sourced metformin tablets (both 
Glucophage). The EU sourced metformin was also used in the pivotal bioequivalence studies.  
In clinical studies, empagliflozin on a background of metformin was evaluated in combination with a 
sulphonylurea, pioglitazone, basal and MDI insulin and DPP-4 inhibitors.

oxide red (E172) for 12.5/850 mg and 12.5/1000 mg strength. The excipients are described in section 
6.1 of the SmPC. 
The product is available in polyvinylchloride/polyvinylidene chloride/aluminium unit dose perforated 
blisters (PVC/PVDC/Alu) as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Empagliflozin 
General information 
The chemical name of empagliflozin is (1S)-1,5-anhydro-1-(4-chloro-3-{4-[(3S)-tetrahydrofuran- 
3-yloxy]benzyl}phenyl)-D-glucitol, also known as D-Glucitol,1,5-anhydro-1-C-[4-chloro-3- 
[[4-[[(3S)-tetrahydro-3-furanyl]oxy]phenyl]methyl]phenyl]-, (1S), corresponding to the molecular 
formula C 23H27ClO7 and it has a relative molecular mass 450.9 g/mol and the following structure: 
The structure of empagliflozin was unambiguously confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR, UV spectroscopy, 
FT-IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. 
Empagliflozin appears as a white to yellowish non-hygroscopic crystalline solid, very slightly soluble in 
water (pH 1-7.4), slightly soluble in acetonitrile and ethanol, sparingly soluble in methanol, and 
practically insoluble in toluene. The molecule has no ionisable centres. Its partition coefficient has 
been determined to be 1.7 at pH 7.4. The pure active substance melts at 150 ± 2 oC. 
Empagliflozin is chiral and possesses 6 stereogenic centres. Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely 
by chiral HPLC/specific optical rotation. A single polymorphic form has been observed for 
empagliflozin and is consistently produced by the manufacturing process. The isolated form is 
non-solvated and non-hydrated. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Empagliflozin is synthesized by a single manufacturer in 4 steps from well-defined starting materials 
with acceptable specifications. The active substance is then recrystallized and milled. Five of the 
stereocentres originate from the chiral pool whereas the sixth benzylic centre is controlled by a 
diastereoselective reduction during the process. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed 
with regards to their origin and fate and characterised. None were deemed to have genotoxic potential. 
Assessment report  
EMA/238334/2015 
Page 8/99 
  
  
 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented and are considered 
adequate. 
The active substance is packaged in a double layer of LDPE resin bags with cable binders, then stored 
away from light in a fibre drum. The primary packaging material complies with the relevant EC 
regulations and Ph. Eur. requirements. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR, HPLC), impurities 
(HPLC), diastereomer (chiral HPLC), assay (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), 
residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), and particle size (laser diffraction). Optical purity is controlled by a test 
for specific optical rotation in the 2 chiral starting materials. The analytical methods used have been 
adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. The limits of 
3 specified impurities are above the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A and they have been 
sufficiently toxicologically qualified (these data were assessed in the MAA procedure for Jardiance 
(EMEA/H/C/002677)). The limit set for one of those impurities will be re-evaluated once sufficient 
manufacturing experience has been gained.   
Batch analysis data on 5 commercial scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results 
are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. Batch analysis date on a further 40 
batches (varying from pilot to commercial scale) carried out using previous incarnations of the 
synthetic process and used for toxicology and clinical studies are also provided, with all batches 
conforming to specifications in place at the time. 
Stability 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches of empagliflozin manufactured using the proposed 
commercial process stored in the intended commercial packaging for up to 36 months under long 
term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions 
(40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Stability was also tested under 
stressed conditions in the solid state (1 commercial scale batch) and in solution (1 development 
batch). Solid state photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on 1 
commercial scale batch. Solid state material was also exposed to high temperature (80 oC) and to 
open storage conditions (40 oC / 75 % RH). Empagliflozin was tested in solution at low (2.5), intrinsic, 
and high (13) pH, each under heat stress conditions (80 oC), in the presence of strong (H2O2), or mild 
(AIBN) oxidants, and under UV irradiation (20 W/m2). The following parameters were tested: 
appearance, impurities (HPLC), diastereomer (chiral HPLC), assay (HPLC), water content (KF) and 
particle size (laser diffraction). The analytical methods used were the same as for release. 
No changes to any test parameters were observed under long term or accelerated conditions. 
Empagliflozin is neither photosensitive, nor affected by high temperature or humidity in the solid 
state. In solution, it is prone to degradation at low and high pH and in the presence of a strong 
oxidant. It is also unstable to a mild oxidant at high pH and slightly sensitive to light. None of the chiral 
centres showed any propensity to epimerisation during the stability studies. The results demonstrate 
that the analytical methods are stability indicating. 
The stability results indicate that the drug substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
Primary stability studies on the three commercial batches will continue up until the proposed re-test 
period.

Metformin hydrochloride 
General information 
Metformin is a well-known active substance often formulated in combination with other antidiabetic 
substances for the treatment of diabetes. The INN name of the active substance is metformin and the 
chemical name is 1,1-dimetylbiguanidine hydrochloride. Its molecular formula and weight are 
C4H11N5.HCl and 165.6 g/mol respectively, and its structure is shown below: 
Metformin hydrochloride is a white or almost white, slighly hygroscopic crystalline powder. It is  freely 
soluble in water, slightly soluble in ethanol and practically insoluble in acetone.  
Metformin hydrochloride has been reported to exist in two polymorphic forms, a stable form and a 
metastable one, which has only been observed under experimental conditions. Therefore no control of 
polymorphism is considered necessary. Metformin hydrochloride has a non-chiral molecular 
structure. 
As there is a monograph of metformin hydrochloride in the European Pharmacopoeia, the 
manufacturer of the active substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European 
Pharmacopoeia (CEP) which has been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation 
Application. 
Manufacture 
The description of manufacturing process steps and in-process controls, characterisation, control of 
materials and of critical steps and intermediates, process validation and manufacturing process 
development are all covered by the CEP. Metformin is manufactured at one manufacturing site. The 
holder of the certificate has declared the absence of use of material of human or animal origin in the 
manufacturing of the substance. 
The relevant information on the manufacture was assessed by the EDQM before issuing the CEP. 
Specification 
The  control  tests  comply  with  the  specifications  and  test  methods  of  the  Ph.  Eur.  monograph,  as 
confirmed  by  the  CEP.  The  CEP  includes  an  additional  control  for  a  residual  solvent  used  in  the 
manufacturer’s synthetic route. 
Batch analyses data for 11 batches were provided. The results are consistent from batch to batch and 
comply with the specification in all cases. 
Stability 
The proposed re-test period and packaging material for metformin are covered by the CEP. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The objective of formulation development was to develop a fixed dose immediate-release tablet of 
empagliflozin and metformin. The quality target product profile (QTPP) was established and defined 
as a twice daily orally administered immediate release film-coated tablet available in 4 strengths 
(5 mg/850 mg, 5 mg/1000 mg, 12.5 mg/850 mg, and 12.5 mg/1000 mg) with adequate purity and 
Assessment report

stability. In addition, the combination product should be bioequivalent with empagliflozin and 
metformin hydrochloride administered as mono products as demonstrated by comparable immediate 
release in vitro dissolution performance in order to promote patient compliance.  
The pharmaceutical development of the current product was largely based on the experience gained 
with empagliflozin film-coated tablets (Jardiance) and linagliptin / metformin hydrochloride 
film-coated tablets (Jentadueto). To combine the low amount of empagliflozin with the relatively high 
quantity of metformin hydrochloride, a wet granulation process with granulation liquid containing 
empagliflozin was chosen. 
Principles of Quality by Design (QbD) were applied to the pharmaceutical development. The critical 
quality attributes (CQAs) of the finished product were identified as those that affect the target design 
quality criteria of purity, strength, drug release and stability, and should be within an appropriate limit 
or range. The identified CQAs are in line with the typical product attributes of an immediate release 
tablet intended for oral administration. Based on the experimental work, particle size distribution of 
metformin hydrochloride, particle size of empagliflozin, Loss on Drying (LOD) of the granules, 
appearance of the tablet cores, tablet hardness, tablet weight, appearance of the film-coated tablets, 
and weight gain of the film-coated tablets were identified as CQAs. A risk assessment was carried out 
in early development and after the experimental work on the potential relationships between critical 
material attributes (CMA) / critical process parameters (CPP) and CQAs of the drug product. Main 
compression force was the only critical process parameter (CPP) identified. A qualitative approach 
was chosen based on results of formulation development and early process development activities in 
lab scale and prior knowledge from formulation development.  No design space was applied for and 
manufacture and validation are carried out classically. Based on the development activities, proven 
acceptable ranges (PARs) were defined for process parameters and material attributes. The settings 
of process parameters were confirmed at production scale. All CMAs/CPPs are included in the control 
strategy. 
Properties of the active substances which are relevant for finished product manufacture or 
performance were sufficiently explained. Both substances are classified as BCS Class III (high 
solubility, limited absorption). The particle size of empagliflozin was fixed during the development of 
empagliflozin film-coated tablets and is suitable for the current fixed-dose combination finished 
product as well. Particle size of metformin was not found to considerably impact the process nor 
influence dissolution or bioavailability and so no requirement for particle size distribution has been 
included in the specification of metformin hydrochloride. 
The selection of excipients was justified. Compatibility between the two active substances and 
between empagliflozin and the excipients of the core tablets was confirmed in binary mixtures. 
Regarding the compatibility of metformin hydrochloride with the excipients of the core tablets and 
compatibility of both substances with the excipients of the film-coat, it was considered acceptable to 
rely on experience with linagliptin / metformin hydrochloride film-coated tablets and empagliflozin 
film-coated tablets respectively. This prior knowledge was supported by stability results of the 
finished product. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards except for the film-coating, which is manufactured by an established supplier and tested 
according to established methods.  
The four strengths can be distinguished by colour and debossing. They have the same shape and 
comparable sizes. 
The fixed-dose combination formulation intended for commercialisation was not used in the phase III 
clinical  trials  which  were  carried  out  using  a  combination  of  empagliflozin  tablets  (supplied  by 
Boehringer  Ingelheim)  and  metformin  hydrochloride  tablets  (Glucophage EU  commercial  product) 
mono  component  products.  In  order  to  bridge  between  the  clinical  and  proposed  commercial 
formulations, a number of bioequivalence studies was carried out, demonstrating the equivalence of 
in vivo performance of all 4 strengths.  
Assessment report  
EMA/238334/2015 
Page 11/99 
  
  
The biobatches used in the bioequivalence studies were manufactured at the intended commercial 
manufacturing site at commercial scale. Representative single entity products were chosen based on 
dissolution  and  assay  data  of  three  batches.  As  no  12.5  mg  strength  has  been  developed  for  the 
empagliflozin single entity product, tablets of the 2.5 mg and 10 mg strength were combined and the 
justification provided in this regard was considered satisfactory. 
In parallel to the bioequivalence studies, comparative dissolution studies were carried out at pH 1, 4.5, 
and 6.8 using the proposed routine dissolution method for the fixed dose combination products. 
Whereas in the case of empagliflozin the dissolution profiles  of test and reference were similar, in the 
case of metformin, the reference formulation dissolution profiles were much slower that the test, 
especially at acidic pH, for all strengths. Moreover a great variability was observed between different 
reference batches of metformin available on the market. However it has been sufficiently 
demonstrated by own data and bibliographic evidence that the routine dissolution conditions used in 
this exercise were over discriminating for metformin hydrochloride with respect to in vivo 
performance. In addition, and considering the aqueous solubility of the two active substances, 
dissolution is not expected to be the limiting factor in vivo. 
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method to be used for quality control purposes has been 
demonstrated. 
The suitability of the container closure system was established during stability testing. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of fluid-bed granulation, blending, compression, and film-coating. 
The critical process parameters and in-process controls (IPCs) have been presented and are justified 
in relation to how the product quality attributes are affected. Control is achieved through a 
combination of specifications (e.g. for input materials), IPCs, control of operating conditions by 
respective quality systems, and specifications of the drug product. The designed control strategy 
ensures that the manufacturing process consistently delivers a drug product that meets the defined 
criteria for all CQAs.  
The main manufacturing operations correspond to a standard process. However due to the low 
empagliflozin content (<2%), the finished product is regarded as specialised dosage form requiring 
production scale process validation data. The manufacturer has, however, significant manufacturing 
experience products with low active substance content. Therefore the process validation data 
presented and the bracketing approach were accepted. The process was successfully validated with 
four production scale batches of the 5 / 500 mg (no marketing authorisation applied for) and the 
12.5 / 850 mg strengths, three production scales batches of the 5 / 850 mg, 5 / 1000 mg, and 
12.5 / 500 mg  (no marketing authorisation applied for) strengths, and one production scale batch of 
the 12.5 / 1000 mg strength. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications comprise appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form 
including description (visual test), identification of empagliflozin (HPLC and UV), identification of 
metformin hydrochloride (HPLC and UV), impurities (HPLC), assay of empagliflozin and of metformin 
hydrochloride (HPLC), dissolution of both active substances (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage unit by 
content uniformity (HPLC), mass variation and microbiological quality (Ph. Eur., skip lot testing as per 
ICH Q6A). The absence of tests for organic solvents, inorganic impurities, enantiomeric purity 
(empagliflozin), hardness and disintegration time has been adequately justified by the applicant and 
relevant data were provided.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 19 commercial scale batches covering all applied strengths 
confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the 
intended product specification.

Stability of the product 
A bracketing design was applied based similarity of composition of the different dosage strengths and 
comparable stability of strengths in stress stability studies. Stability data on 14 commercial scale 
batches of finished product  covering all strengths, stored under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% 
RH) for up to 24 months and under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) for up to 6 months 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches were manufactured at commercial scale 
according to the proposed manufacturing process at the intended commercial manufacturing site. 
Tested parameters were description, dissolution, degradation products, assay, and microbiological 
quality. The latter was tested initially and thereafter yearly under long term conditions. The analytical 
methods were the same as for release. The HPLC method for assay and degradation products of 
empagliflozin was modified during the stability studies to improve robustness and selectivity. No 
relevant change or trend to any of the measured parameters was observed under either condition. 
The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
Stressed stability studies at elevated temperature, high humidity, and a photostability study as per 
ICH Q1B were carried out on one production scale batch of each strength. Tested parameters were 
description, loss on drying, dissolution, degradation products, assay, and microbiological quality. The 
latter was only tested at high humidity. No changes were observed at elevated temperature and under 
light stress conditions. Moderate changes were observed in loss on drying after open storage at all 
storage conditions and degradation of empagliflozin after open storage at 40°C / 75% RH. However 
these changes were within the specification. It is concluded that no labelling precautions are 
necessary for the commercial product regarding exposure to heat, moisture, or light. 
Adventitious agents 
The drug product is produced with no materials of human or animal origin.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substances and the finished 
product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product and its 
manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation:

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
Empagliflozin 
Empagliflozin is a selective and potent inhibitor of the human, rat and mouse glucose transporter 
SGLT2. Non-clinical data of empagliflozin has been evaluated in the context of the initial marketing 
application of Jardiance (available in the European Public Assessment Report: 
http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Public_assessment_report/hum
an/002677/WC500168594.pdf) 
Metformin 
No primary pharmacodynamic studies with metformin have been performed by the applicant. 
Metformin, belonging to the biguanide class, is the first-line drug of choice for the treatment of type 
2 diabetes, in particular in overweight and obese people and those with normal kidney function. The 
mechanism of action of metformin is complex, involves different cellular pathways and is still not fully 
understood. Metformin improves hyperglycaemia primarily through its suppression of hepatic glucose 
production and decreases absorption of glucose from the gastrointestinal tract. No secondary or 
safety pharmacology studies with metformin were conducted by the applicant. 
Empagliflozin/Metformin 
Empagliflozin in combination with metformin has been tested acutely (single dosing) with an oral 
glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in Zucker fatty diabetes (ZDF) rats. Both empagliflozin at a dose of 3 
mg/kg and metformin at a dose of 300 mg/kg as well as the combination achieved a robust reduction 
of glucose excursion in plasma after oral glucose administration, assessed by glucose AUC. The 
combination of empagliflozin with metformin reduced plasma glucose AUC by 63%, and this reduction 
was significantly greater than the effect achieved with each monotherapy alone (empagliflozin: 37%, 
metformin: 39%). 
A chronic 28 day study has been conducted in ZDF rats to investigate the effect of empagliflozin (3 
mg/kg/day) combined with metformin (300 mg/kg/day) on glucose homeostasis. Following 28 days 
of treatment, fasting glucose was further improved by empagliflozin when combined with metformin. 
This was also associated with a superior reduction of HbA1c (-4.80%) for the combination, compared 
to monotherapy treatments (-3.32% for empagliflozin and -2.12% for metformin) from a baseline of 
14.4% in the vehicle-treated group. Superiority of the combination was also observed in an OGTT 
performed at the end of the study. However, in this model a trend towards increased body weight gain 
was observed after either metformin or empagliflozin treatment. The combination further enhanced 
this effect on body weight gain which was now statistically significant throughout the study. At the end 
of the 28-day drug treatment period, the body weights of the ZDF rats administered BI 10773 3 
mg/kg po, metformin 300 mg/kg po and the combination of BI 10773 and metformin were 7.1%, 
7.3% and 16.2% higher, respectively, than those of the vehicle-treated animals. The effect on body 
weight gain by empagliflozin conflicts with previous results obtained in dietary-induced obese Wistar 
rats, where body weight was reduced by empagliflozin treatment. Similarly, in humans empagliflozin 
also has a diminishing effect of body weight.  
Based on the available data and known differential pharmacology of metformine and empagliflozin, it 
is agreed that no secondary pharmacology studies are performed with the combination of both 
compounds. 
Assessment report  
EMA/238334/2015 
Page 14/99 
  
  
There were no adverse effects in empagliflozin safety pharmacology studies indicative of potential 
human safety concerns. Dedicated safety pharmacology studies were not conducted for metformin 
due to the lack of adverse outcomes derived from extensive cumulative clinical data. Therefore 
evaluation of the combination in a full battery of safety pharmacology studies was considered 
unwarranted. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Empagliflozin 
Empagliflozin has previously been assessed in detail (EPAR of Jardiance: 
http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Public_assessment_report/hum
an/002677/WC500168594.pdf). Empagliflozin was well absorbed following oral administration in all 
animal species investigated and adequate plasma exposure was achieved in toxicology studies. In rat 
and dog toxicology studies, empagliflozin plasma exposure following oral administration generally 
increased proportionally with dose. The oral bioavailability of empagliflozin was high in the CD-1 
mouse (90-97%), moderate in the Wistar rat (31%), and high in the beagle dog (89%). In mice, the 
clearance of empagliflozin was moderate, the steady-state volume of distribution was moderate, and 
the elimination halflife after intravenous administration was moderate. The disposition of 
empagliflozin in rat and dog was characterized by low to intermediate clearance, moderate volume of 
distribution, and moderate half-life. In rat and dog toxicology studies, there were no consistent trends 
in the toxicokinetic data to suggest an effect of repeated dosing on plasma exposure, indicating that 
there was little or no accumulation of empagliflozin. Empagliflozin is a substrate for the efflux 
transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Since the 
bioavailability of empagliflozin in all preclinical animal species was high, and in the single rising dose 
clinical study there was a linear relationship between oral dose and plasma exposure at all 
administered doses, interactions between empagliflozin and P-gp or BCRP are not likely to restrict its 
absorption. 
The mean plasma protein binding of empagliflozin was determined in the plasma of mouse (88.1%), 
rat (90.5%), rabbit (91.1%), dog (88.8%), and human (83.7%). Partitioning of empagliflozin into 
blood cells was moderate in all species tested. In a QWBA study in the male pigmented rat, 
distribution of radiolabeled empagliflozin or its metabolites into tissues following oral administration 
was limited. Matrices with the highest concentrations of empagliflozin-derived radioactivity were the 
gastrointestinal tract contents, urine, and bile. Radioactivity was not measurable in central nervous 
system tissues protected by the blood brain barrier at any sampling time. Similarly, radioactivity was 
not associated with the melanin-containing tissues in the eye or skin, and was not detected in testis, 
lens of the eye, or bone marrow at any sampling time. In timed-pregnant Wistar (Han) rats, the 
distribution of radioactivity was limited. Peak concentrations of radioactivity were low in the maternal 
reproductive tissues. Empagliflozin-derived radioactivity was not observed in the fetuses of the 
Gestation Day 13 animals, but was observed at low levels at one time point of the Gestation Day 18 
animals, suggesting that drug-derived radioactivity does cross the placental barrier, but at low levels. 
Empagliflozin is a substrate of two uptake transporters expressed at the liver sinusoidal membrane, 
OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, and one kidney transporter, OAT3. Transport of empagliflozin by efflux (P-gp, 
BCRP) and uptake (OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT3) transporters may affect its disposition in humans. 
In humans, the primary route of metabolism was glucuronidation by multiple UGT isoforms, resulting 
in the formation of 3 glucuronide conjugates, while oxidation was the primary route of metabolism in 
the mouse, rat, and dog. Ten metabolites of empagliflozin were identified in the plasma or excreta of 
mice, 7 in rats, 12 in dogs, and 6 in human. The 3 most abundant glucuronide metabolites identified 
in human plasma were found in dog and mouse plasma and were not detected in rat plasma. In 
Assessment report  
EMA/238334/2015 
Page 15/99 
  
  
humans, no single glucuronide metabolite was considered major (>10% of total drug-related 
material). Oxidative metabolites of empagliflozin identified in human excreta collectively do not 
exceed 10% of dose, and as such it is unlikely that empagliflozin exposure will be affected by drugs 
that are known to inhibit or inactivate oxidative metabolism. Empagliflozin is not an inducer, inhibitor, 
or inactivator of the major human CYP450 isoforms at steady-state plasma concentrations achieved 
following dosing at the maximal therapeutic dose of 25 mg qd. Thus, the potential for empagliflozin to 
reversibly inhibit or inactivate the major CYP450 isoforms is remote, and drug-drug interactions 
involving the major CYP450 isoforms with empagliflozin and concomitantly administered substrates of 
these enzymes are considered unlikely. 
The primary route of elimination of empagliflozin and its metabolites, following either PO or IV dosing, 
was through excretion into feces in mouse, rat, and dog (48-82% of administered dose). In all 
preclinical species evaluated, urinary excretion also contributed to the excretion of empagliflozin and 
its metabolites (3.5-36% of administered dose). In the human ADME study, in which a single 50 mg 
dose of radiolabeled empagliflozin was administered orally, 34.2% of the dose was recovered as 
parent empagliflozin in feces, and 23.7% of the dose was recovered as parent empagliflozin in urine. 
In a lacteal secretion study in the Wistar (Han) rat, empagliflozin-derived radioactivity was excreted 
into milk at all time points through 24 hr postdose. Mean milk:plasma concentration ratios ranged 
from a low of 0.634 at 1 hr to a high of 5.00 at 8 hr postdose. In humans dosed orally with 
[14C]empagliflozin, unchanged empagliflozin comprised 43.5% of urine radioactivity and 82.9% of 
fecal radioactivity. Overall, 57.9% of the administered dose was excreted as parent compound. The 
overall mean recovery of the administered radioactivity in urine and feces was 95.6%; recovery in 
individual subjects ranged from 93.0 to 99.4%. 
Metformin 
Metformin hydrochloride is highly soluble but poorly permeable. Thus, metformin can be classified as 
BCS class III drug. The oral bioavailability in rats was low, about 30% in doses ranging from 50 to 200 
mg/kg. 
Metformin has moderate to high volume of distribution (2-3 L/kg) in mice and rats, indicating 
extensive tissue distribution, and was confirmed experimentally by dosing radiolabeled metformin. 
High concentrations of radioactivity were found in the gastrointestinal tract (stomach, jejunum, ileum 
and colon), kidneys, liver and the salivary glands at concentrations higher than in blood. Lower levels 
were observed in the heart, skeletal muscle, white fat, and brain, indicating that metformin and/or 
metabolites may cross the blood brain barrier. OCTs were shown to be involved in the renal and 
hepatic distribution of metformin. Metformin does not bind appreciably to plasma proteins, but 
demonstrates a time-dependent association with erythrocytes in blood. This may be explained by 
slow uptake into erythrocytes due to the low permeability. Based on human data, metformin crosses 
the blood-placenta-barrier. 
Metformin does not inhibit human CYP450 enzymes. The overall contribution of metabolic 
transformation of metformin to its elimination is low in preclinical species, and in human metformin is 
not metabolized and is completely excreted as unchanged parent. However, in rats, it has been 
demonstrated that metformin is partially metabolized via CYP2C11, CYP2D1 and CYP3A1/2. Due to 
this CYP450-mediated metabolism of metformin in the rat, a slight intestinal or hepatic first pass 
metabolism has been observed.  
Renal elimination of unchanged metformin is the principal pathway of excretion in preclinical species, 
and the sole pathway of excretion in human. Active secretion involving human transporters MATE2-K 
and OCT2 in the proximal tubules of the kidney is suggested to be a mechanism driving renal 
excretion, in addition to glomerular filtration. Biliary excretion is low or non-existent in preclinical 
Assessment report

species and human. Metformin is excreted into milk in humans. Animal data concerning excretion of 
metformin into milk in lactating animals is not currently available in the literature. 
Empagliflozin/Metformin 
Based on nonclinical data for empagliflozin and metformin, in particular their metabolism and 
transport characteristics, pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between empagliflozin and 
metformin at the intended therapeutic doses are highly unlikely. Additionally, a clinical DDI study was 
conducted in which metformin (1000 mg, bid) and empagliflozin (50 mg, qd) were co-administered to 
steady-state. Empagliflozin exposure was not affected by co-administration with metformin. The 
fraction of empagliflozin excreted into urine was not affected by co-administration with metformin. 
Similarly, metformin exposure was not affected by co-administration with empagliflozin. The fraction 
of metformin excreted into urine was not affected by co-administration with empagliflozin. These data 
indicate that no clinical DDI was observed for metformin and empagliflozin when the two drugs were 
co-administered. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
Empagliflozin 
Empagliflozin has been assessed previously in the MAA procedure for Jardiance (EPAR: 
http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Public_assessment_report/hum
an/002677/WC500168594.pdf).  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, genotoxicity, fertility and early embryonic development. 
In long term toxicity studies in rodents and dogs, signs of toxicity were observed at exposures greater 
than or equal to 10-times the clinical dose of empagliflozin. Most toxicity was consistent with 
secondary pharmacology related to urinary glucose loss and electrolyte imbalances including 
decreased body weight and body fat, increased food consumption, diarrhea, dehydration, decreased 
serum glucose and increases in other serum parameters reflective of increased protein metabolism 
and gluconeogenesis, urinary changes such as polyuria and glucosuria, and microscopic changes 
including mineralisation in kidney and some soft and vascular tissues. Microscopic evidence of the 
effects of exaggerated pharmacology on the kidney observed in some species included tubular 
dilatation, and tubular and pelvic mineralisation at approximately 4-times the clinical AUC exposure of 
empagliflozin associated with the 25 mg dose. 
The genotoxic potential of empagliflozin was investigated in several assays, in which empagliflozin  
was found to be without genotoxic potential. 
In a 2 year carcinogenicity study, empagliflozin did not increase the incidence of tumors in female rats 
up to the highest dose of 700 mg/kg/day, which corresponds to approximately 72-times the maximal 
clinical AUC exposure to empagliflozin. In male rats, treatment-related benign vascular proliferative 
lesions (haemangiomas) of the mesenteric lymph node were observed at the highest dose, but not at 
300 mg/kg/day, which corresponds to approximately 26-times the maximal clinical exposure to 
empagliflozin. Interstitial cell tumors in the testes were observed with a higher incidence in rats at 300 
mg/kg/day and above, but not at 100 mg/kg/day which corresponds to approximately 18-times the 
maximal clinical exposure to empagliflozin. Both tumors are common in rats and are unlikely to be 
relevant to humans. 
Empagliflozin did not increase the incidence of tumors in female mice at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day, 
which corresponds to approximately 62-times the maximal clinical exposure to empagliflozin. 
Empagliflozin induced renal tumors in male mice at 1000 mg/kg/day, but not at 300 mg/kg/day, 
which corresponds to approximately 11-times the maximal clinical exposure to empagliflozin. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/238334/2015 
Page 17/99 
  
  
mode of action for these tumors is dependent on the natural predisposition of the male mouse to renal 
pathology and a metabolic pathway not reflective of humans. The male mouse renal tumors are 
considered not relevant to humans. 
At exposures sufficiently in excess of exposure in humans after therapeutic doses, empagliflozin had 
no adverse effects on fertility or early embryonic development. Empagliflozin administered during the 
period of organogenesis was not teratogenic. Only at maternally toxic doses, empagliflozin also 
caused bent limb bones in the rat and increased embryofetal loss in the rabbit. 
In pre- and postnatal toxicity studies in rats, reduced weight gain of offspring was observed at 
maternal exposures approximately 4-times the maximal clinical exposure to empagliflozin. No such 
effect was seen at systemic exposure equal to the maximal clinical exposure to empagliflozin. The 
relevance of this finding to humans is unclear. 
Metformin 
The general toxicity of metformin was studied in a 2-week toxicity study and in a metformin alone 
group of the 2- and 13-week combination toxicity study in the rat. Target organs were the heart, liver, 
kidneys, salivary glands, ovaries, thymus, gastrointestinal tract and adrenal glands. In addition, body 
weight gain was reduced. Metformin was administered by oral gavage to rats at dosages of 0, 100, 
200 or 1000 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks. At 1000 mg/kg/day, body weight gain was slightly decreased. 
The organ weights of the heart, liver, adrenals, pituitary (females only) were increased and thymus 
weights were reduced. Microscopic concentric hypertrophy of the ventricle myocardium correlated 
with increased heart weights. Other microscopic findings consisted of cytoplasmic vacuolation of the 
adrenal medulla (zona fasciculata), hyperplasia of the pituitary gland (females only) and atrophy of 
the seminal vesicles (males). There were also alterations of the parotid salivary gland and size 
reduction of the cortical areas of the thymus. The NOAEL was 200 mg/kg/day with a Cmax,ss of 70.100 
nM and AUC(0-24)ss of 374000 nM•h.  
According to the NDA of Glumetza (metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets), genotoxicity 
assessments for metformin in the Ames test, gene mutation test (mouse lymphoma cells), 
chromosomal aberrations test (human lymphocytes), and in vivo mouse micronucleus tests were 
negative. 
According to the Summary basis of approval for Glumetza, long-term carcinogenicity studies with 
metformin have been performed in Sprague Dawley rats at doses of 150, 300, and 450 mg/kg/day in 
males and 150, 450, 900, 1200 mg/kg/day in females. These doses were approximately 2, 4, and 8 
times in males, and 3, 7, 12, and 16 times therapeutic exposures based AUC values with the 
maximum recommended human daily dose of 2000 mg/kg/day. No evidence of carcinogenicity with 
metformin was found in either male or female rats. No additional studies have been performed by the 
applicant. 
According to the Summary basis of approval for Glumetza, fertility of male or female rats was 
unaffected by metformin and was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day, 
which represent 3 and 6 times the MRHD of 2000 mg based on body surface area comparison for rats 
and rabbits, respectively. 
In an embryo-fetal development study performed by the applicant metformin was administered by 
oral gavage to bred female Wistar (Han) rats at up to 1000 mg/kg/day from gestation day (GD) 7 to 
16. The mean body weight gain of all dose groups was decreased. In the foetuses shortened truncus 
brachiocephalicus and small kidney were observed at 1000 mg/kg/day. In the skeleton, the observed 
variations were attributable to delayed ossification indicating developmental retardation. Most of 
them occurred at 1000 mg/kg/day dose group, but they were also observed at 500 mg/kg/day. 
Skeletal and external malformations were seen at 1000 mg/kg/day. They comprised split sternebra 
lateral axis, flat and thickened rib (unilateral and bilateral), and rib z-shaped (bilateral) as well as 
Assessment report  
EMA/238334/2015 
Page 18/99 
  
  
single unilateral anophthalmia and single unilateral polydactylia in one litter. Flat and thickened ribs 
(bilateral) were also seen at 500 mg/kg/day. There was an increased incidence of scapula bent 
inwardly (finding without classification) at 500 and 1000 mg/kg/day. At the NOAEL of 200 mg/kg/day 
the maternal plasma exposure was 638 µM.h, which gives a safety margin of approximately 4. 
Empagliflozin/Metformin 
In the two week combination study, the coadministration of 500/1000 mg/kg/day 
empaglifozin/metformin is clearly above the maximum tolerated dose as evidenced by lower body 
weight gain or body weight loss, lethality and adverse clinical observations prior to scheduled sacrifice. 
Several adverse findings were observed in the 300/600 empaglifozin/metformin coadministration 
group; including, hunched appearance, dehydration, decreased body weight gain in males, and 
cortical tubular degeneration and mineralization of the pelvic calices of the kidney. Mineralization of 
the pelvic calices of the kidney (calculi) was observed with increased incidence in the 300/600- and 
500/1000 mg/kg/day coadministration dose groups compared with the 500 mg/kg/day empaglifozin 
group; most animals with this finding also had hydronephrosis. The combination of mineralization of 
pelvic calices (calculi) and hydronephrosis was considered adverse. The NOAEL for the 
coadministration of empaglifozin and metformin is 100/200 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL corresponds to a 
Cmax and AUC0-24 for empaglifozin of 17150 nM and 61900 nM·h, respectively (sexes combined), and 
for metformin; 64350 nM and 429000 nM·h, respectively (sexes combined).  
In a 13-week toxicity study, rats were administered empagliflozin/metformin at doses of 50/100, 
100/200, or 200/400 mg/kg/day, 200 mg/kg/day empagliflozin or 400 mg/kg/day metformin. There 
were no test article-related deaths during this study. Transient clinical signs, ano-genital staining in 
males and watery/unformed stool in both sexes, were noted at 200/400 mg/kg/day 
empagliflozin/metformin between Days 2 and 11. In addition, there was increased food consumption 
at all dose levels and lower body weight only in males at 200/0 (-5%) and 200/400 mg/kg/day 
empagliflozin/Metformin (-7% to -15%). The oral administration of empagliflozin (alone and/or in 
combination with metformin) resulted in expected pharmacologic glucosuric and hypoglycemic effects 
at all doses (both sexes). Empagliflozin-associated effects were kidney (all doses; both sexes) and 
liver-related (≥100/≥200 mg/kg/day empagliflozin/metformin; both sexes) and were exacerbated 
when combined with metformin. Findings included electrolyte variances (mainly hypochloraemia, 
which is usually associated with acid-base disturbances), aciduria, liver enzyme elevations (less than 
2-fold) and increases in kidney and liver weights. In addition, at the high dose coadministration of 
500/1000 empagliflozin/metformin, cortical tubular epithelial cell degeneration was uniquely 
observed and in these animals other renal pathology was exacerbated (hydronephrosis) or occurred 
with increased incidence (cortical tubular vacuolation or mineralisation). Also the severity of the 
hypochloraemia and aciduria was greater with combination treatment and was dose-related, 
indicating that combination therapy magnified hypochloraemia and aciduria. Taken together these 
data suggest that empagliflozin’s effects on renal physiology, electrolyte balance and acid/base state 
is more prominent/occurs at lower doses when empagliflozin is administered concomitantly with 
metformin, than when administered alone. Renal toxicity is seen only at high exposure levels and the 
combination does not lead to smaller safety margins in this respect. 
Decreased thymus weights at 200/0 and ≥100/≥200 mg/kg/day empagliflozin/metformin correlated 
with reduced body weight and/or increased adrenal weights and reduced glucose levels. The 
decreased thymus weight was not associated with microscopic changes that would suggest a direct 
effect of empagliflozin on the thymus. Consequently, these phenomena are interpreted as 
stress-related.  
After a 1-month dose-free period, absolute body weight in the 200/0 and 200/400 mg/kg/day 
empagliflozin/metformin males were still lower than controls. There were no new target organs 
identified with the combination of empagliflozin/metformin compared to empagliflozin or metformin 
alone. Under the conditions of this study, due to hypochloraemia, the 
Assessment report

Page 19/99 
  
  
no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) was considered to be 50/100 mg/kg/day 
empagliflozin/metformin. This dose level is associated with a safety margin of 4 for empagliflozin and 
2 for metformin, based on plasma AUC values. 
Neither empagliflozin nor metformin were shown previously to be genotoxic, therefore additional 
genotoxicity studies were considered unwarranted. 
Since the mode of action that causes the renal tumors in mice is not considered relevant for humans, 
it can be agreed that no combination carcinogenicity study is performed. 
No microscopic changes in reproductive organs were seen in the rat in the 13 week 
empagliflozin/metformin combination study. Since neither empagliflozin nor metformin were shown 
to affect fertility, a combination fertility study with empagliflozin/metformin was not considered 
warranted in accordance with the guideline of the non-clinical development of fixed dose 
combinations of medicinal products. 
In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant Wistar (Han) rats empagliflozin/metformin was 
administered by oral gavage at dose levels of 30/60, 100/200, 300/600, 300/0, and 0/600 mg/kg/day 
from gestation days 7-16. Maternal and developmental toxicity was evident at 300/600 mg/kg/day 
empagliflozin/metformin as indicated by reductions in body weight gain and/or body weight during 
the administration period, early and late resorptions, lower fetal weight, visceral and skeletal 
variations and skeletal malformations. A similar pattern was seen in the metformin only (600) group. 
In contrast, the empagliflozin only (300) group showed reduction in maternal body weight, but 
developmental effects. In the metformin only study, Metformin provoked developmental retardation 
and induced changes during organogenesis of the rib cage, the axial skeleton and the scapula at a 
dose of 1000 mg/kg and in clearly less extent at a dose of 500 mg/kg, pointing to a teratogenic action 
of metformin. Malformations observed at 300:600 mg/kg empagliflozin:metformin HCl are therefore 
considered to be due to metformin and not to empagliflozin. However, glucose measurements on GD 
7 indicate a trend towards a empagliflozin dose dependent decrease. Part of the observed fetal 
morphological changes in the 300:600 mg/kg empagliflozin:metformin HCl may therefore partly be 
attributable to dysglycaemia, resulting from treating normoglycemic rats. 
The NOAEL for the combination of empagliflozin/metformin for maternal and developmental toxicity 
was 100/200 mg/kg/day empagliflozin/metformin and the NOAEL for renal development 
was >300/600 mg/kg/day empagliflozin/metformin. 
The reproductive/developmental toxicity profiles of empagliflozin and metformin are sufficiently 
characterized, therefore a combination pre- and postnatal study with empagliflozin/metformin was 
not considered warranted in accordance with the guideline of the non-clinical development of fixed 
dose combinations of medicinal products. 
There were no local tolerance studies performed with the empagliflozin/metformin combination, since 
there were no specific concerns with either empagliflozin or metformin alone. 
No impurities or degradants specific to the empagliflozin/metformin FDC have been observed in the 
drug product above the ICH Q3B qualification threshold at release or on primary stability. 
Furthermore, these impurities and degradants have been screened and all were predicted to be 
non-mutagenic. 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Both metformin and empagliflozin are already marketed by the same applicant for patients with the 
same indication. For both compounds an ERA has already been performed and assessed for the 
patient population with the indication of diabetes II (See paragraph I.1.5). The fixed combination 
product does not include new indications. Because of this and because the same maximum dosage is

applied, an increase in use of the individual active ingredients is not expected. Thus, an ERA does not 
need to be performed for this combination product. 
Metformin 
An  ERA 
for  metformin  was  performed 
for 
the  product  Trajentamet 
(Jentadueto, 
EMEA/H/C/002279/0000). The assessment of the phase II ERA, study summaries and an EPAR were

2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Empagliflozin is a selective and potent inhibitor of the human, rat and mouse glucose transporter 
SGLT2. 
Metformin, a compound belonging to the biguanide class, improves hyperglycemia primarily through 
its suppression of hepatic glucose production and decreases absorption of glucose from the 
gastrointestinal tract. 
In a primary pharmacology study in ZDF rats, fasting glucose was further improved by empagliflozin 
when combined with metformin. This was also associated with a superior reduction of HbA1c for the 
combination. Superiority of the combination was also observed in an OGTT performed at the end of 
the study. However, in this model a trend towards increased body weight gain was observed after 
either metformin or empagliflozin treatment, which contradicts with previous results in 
dietary-induced obese Wistar rats, where body weight was reduced by empagliflozin treatment. 
Based on nonclinical data for empagliflozin and metformin, in particular their metabolism and 
transport characteristics, pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between empagliflozin and 
metformin at the intended therapeutic doses are highly unlikely. 
In a 13-week toxicity study, rats were administered empagliflozin/metformin which resulted in 
expected pharmacologic glucosuric and hypoglycemic effects at all doses (both sexes). 
Empagliflozin-associated effects were kidney (all doses; both sexes) and liver-related (≥100/≥200 
mg/kg/day empagliflozin/metformin; both sexes) and were exacerbated when combined with 
metformin. Findings included electrolyte variances (mainly hypochloremia, which is usually 
associated with acid-base disturbances), aciduria, liver enzyme elevations (less than 2-fold) and 
increases in kidney and liver weights. In addition, at the high dose coadministration of 500/1000 
empagliflozin/metformin, cortical tubular epithelial cell degeneration was uniquely observed and in 
these animals other renal pathology was exacerbated (hydronephrosis) or occurred with increased 
incidence (cortical tubular vacuolation or mineralisation). Also the severity of the hypochloremia and 
aciduria was greater with combination treatment and was dose-related, indicating that combination 
Assessment report  
EMA/238334/2015 
Page 23/99 
  
  
 
 
 
therapy magnified hypochloremia and aciduria. Taken together these data suggest that 
empagliflozin’s effects on renal physiology, electrolyte balance and acid/base state is more 
prominent/occurs at lower doses when empagliflozin is administered concomitantly with metformin, 
than when administered alone. Renal toxicity is seen only at high exposure levels and the combination 
does not lead to smaller safety margins in this respect. 
Decreased thymus weights at 200/0 and ≥100/≥200 mg/kg/day empagliflozin/metformin correlated 
with reduced body weight and/or increased adrenal weights and reduced glucose levels. The 
decreased thymus weight was not associated with microscopic changes that would suggest a direct 
effect of empagliflozin on the thymus. Consequently, these phenomena are interpreted as 
stress-related. 
In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant Wistar (Han) rats empagliflozin/metformin or 
metformin alone caused teratogenicity mostly evident as an increase in skeletal malformations. These 
effects were seen starting at a dose level of 500 mg/kg/day. At this dose level plasma exposure was 
approximately 7 times the maximal human exposure to metformin. This finding is noteworthy as 
SmPC wording from other metformin containing products generally state that metformin is not a 
reproductive toxicant. This findings are now adequately reflected in the SmPC section 5.3. 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
An adequate rationale and supportive non-clinical evidence has been provided for the combined use 
of empagliflozin and metformin in the treatment of T2DM. The safety of the FDC of empagliflozin and 
metformin has been sufficiently investigated. It was shown that empagliflozin’s effects on renal 
physiology, electrolyte balance and acid/base state is more prominent/occurs at lower doses when 
empagliflozin is administered concomitantly with metformin, than when administered alone, with 
hypochloremia occurring at exposures of approximately 9- times and 3-times the clinical exposure for 
empagliflozin and metformin respectively (Safety margins at NOAEL 4 and 2 times, respectively).  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
As the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of metformin are well known, no specific studies with 
respect to the pharmacokinetics of metformin were submitted.  
In this report the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin administered alone are discussed and in 
combination with metformin (interaction as well as bioequivalence). Also bioequivalence of metformin 
in the combination products will be discussed here. 
The pharmacokinetics of metformin are only summarized here. 
Assessment report  
EMA/238334/2015 
Page 24/99 
  
  
Metformin administered alone 
Absorption and bioavailability 
After an oral dose of metformin, Tmax is reached in 2.5 hours. The absolute bioavailability is 
approximately 50% to 60%. After oral administration, metformin hydrochloride absorption is 
saturable and has a limited absorption window and therefore metformin pharmacokinetics are 
non-linear. At the usual metformin doses and dosing schedules, steady state plasma concentrations 
are reached within 24 to 48 hours. Food decreases the extent, and slightly delays the absorption, of 
metformin as shown by an approximately 40% lower Cmax, a 25% lower AUC, and a 35-minute 
prolongation of Tmax following administration of a single 850 mg tablet. However, the clinical 
relevance of these changes is unknown. 
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding is negligible. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes and the blood peak is 
lower than the plasma peak and appears at approximately the same time. The mean volume of 
distribution is between 63-276 L according to the EU SmPC and on average 654 L according to the US 
prescribing information. 
Metabolism and elimination 
Metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine; no metabolites have been identified in humans. The 
renal clearance of metformin is greater than 400 mL/min, indicating that metformin is eliminated by 
glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Following an oral dose, the apparent terminal elimination 
half-life is approximately 6.5 hours. 
Empagliflozin administered alone 
Drug Products 
During drug development three formulations were used: 
The formulation TF-I was developed in the dose strengths of 0.5 mg, 5 mg, 25 mg and 100 mg. 
Formulation TF-II was developed for Phase II clinical studies based on TF-I as this formulation 
provided the desired systemic exposure and stability. The qualitative composition of TF-II is the same 
as for TF-I but differ in the quantitative composition. The final formulation 25 mg FF contained in the 
tablet core the same excipients as TF-II with an optimized quantitative composition. The 10 mg 
formulation has a composition different from the 25 mg tablets. 
Specific and high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) 
methods for the quantification of empagliflozin and its metabolite were developed and validated for 
human urine and plasma to support the clinical empagliflozin development program. Initially, the 
assays were developed for empagliflozin and its metabolite and they were later modified for the 
determination of empagliflozin only. 
Population Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic Modelling 
The applicant performed a Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic 
modelling of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
Assessment report  
EMA/238334/2015

Pharmacokinetic Results 
The demographic covariates (BMI, age, gender, and race) as well as TPRO had a significant, but small 
impact on empagliflozin's CL/F and AUCô,ss, respectively. The typical AUC,ss values were generally 
within ±25% of the reference group value across the range of most commonly observed covariate 
values and thus were considered as not clinically relevant. Furthermore, the apparent oral clearance 
of empagliflozin decreased with a decrease in eGFR leading to an increase in drug exposure. The 
typical AUC,ss increased by 18.5% (95% CI: 13.0, 24.8), 49.2% (95% CI: 39.2, 60.6), 88.1% (95% 
CI: 69.9, 107) in patients with an eGFR of 60, 30, and 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively, compared 
to a reference patient with a eGFR of 100 mL/min/1.73 m2. Other covariates tested included smoking 
status and liver enzymes (LDH, AST, ALT, and AP) did not have a significant effect on the PK of 
empagliflozin. These results are further elaborated and commented upon with the respective headers 
in this report. 
Absorption and Bioequivalence 
The Applicant did not provided an absolute bioavailability study in which a comparison of the exposure 
to empagliflozin is compared between an intravenous dose and an oral dose. 
However, in the mass-balance study 54% of the radioactivity administered orally was found in the 
urine and about 5% in the faeces as metabolites. It can therefore be assumed that at least 60% of the 
oral dose is absorbed.  
The provided data indicates that the final 25 mg formulation can be considered bioequivalent with the 
trial formulation FT-II which is used in the pivotal pharmacokinetic studies. However, in some phase 
I studies also the trial formulation FT-I was used. As the quantitative composition of this formulation 
differ substantially from the final formulation (FF) as well as from the other trial formulation FT-II, 
comparison of the results with this first formulation is difficult to make as no comparative 
bioavailability study was submitted. As stated by Applicant empagliflozin can be considered as a Class 
III drug in the BCS, a biowaiver for this formulation can be granted as this formulation was only used 
in three non-pivotal studies and The submitted studies demonstrate that food significantly affect the 
bioavailability of empagliflozin. The extent of exposure (AUC) is decreased by 10 - 15% and the rate 
of exposure Cmax by more than 25%. The differences are considered not clinical relevant. 
In study 1245.79 was shown that the 10 mg formulation was bioequivalent with the 25 mg 
formulation under fasting conditions. The 90% confidence intervals for the extent and rate of 
absorption were, after dose correction, within the acceptance ranges of 0.80 - 1.25. 
Distribution 
Empagliflozin is rapidly absorbed following oral administration empagliflozin with a mean t max of 0.938 
h in plasma. After reaching peak levels, plasma concentrations declined in a biphasic fashion with a 
rapid distribution phase and a slower elimination phase, with a half-life of 16 hours. The apparent 
steady-state volume of distribution was 73.8 L. The apparent terminal elimination half-life of 
empagliflozin was 12.4 hours, and the apparent oral clearance was 10.6 L/h.  
The protein binding in human plasma is about 80 - 86% and the distribution to red blood cell 28 - 37% 
of the plasma concentration. 
In Figure  the figure below typical concentration-time curves of empagliflozin upon oral administration 
are given. 
Assessment report  
EMA/238334/2015 
Page 26/99 
  
  
Figure 1 Concentration-time curve of empagliflozin upon oral administration of 50 mg in 
plasma and blood. 
Excretion 
Of the total radioactivity orally administered 54% was recovered in the urine and 41% in the faeces. 
In urine 28.6% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. In faeces, unchanged empagliflozin 
was found to represent 82.9% of faecal radioactivity (34.1% of radioactive dose). The remaining 
faecal radioactivity was accounted for primarily by three metabolites, all of which were also observed 
in plasma. 
Metabolism 
In humans, unchanged empagliflozin is the most abundant drug-related component in plasma (75.5 
- 77.4% of total radioactivity). A total of six metabolites of empagliflozin were detected in plasma. 
However, none are considered as major metabolites as the proportion of each metabolite was less 
than 10% of total drug-related exposure. Empagliflozin biotransformation primarily involved 
glucuronidation, and to a lesser extent oxidation. As such, the most abundant metabolites of 
empagliflozin were three glucuronide conjugates (3.3 - 7.4% of plasma radioactivity). 
Only in urine only small amounts of this metabolite could be detected after oral administration of 25 
mg empagliflozin. As the metabolites do not contribute to the clinical efficacy and safety as the 
amount in plasma is less than 10% or the total dose, the lack of further information on the 
pharmacokinetics of these metabolites is acceptable. 
No information on possible genetic polymorphism was discussed by the Applicant as the metabolites 
formed by enzymes with are subjected to polymorphism (e.g. UGT1A1) are only formed in small 
quantities.  
Empagliflozin exposure increased in a more or less dose proportional way over the dose range 0.5 mg 
to 800 mg following single oral administration to healthy volunteers. Cmax was near dose proportional 
from 0.5 to 800 mg. Paired comparisons of dose groups indicated that increases in Cmax were dose 
proportional from 0.5 to 400 mg and slightly less than dose proportional from 400 to 800 mg. 
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of empagliflozin were similar after multiple dosing at 
steady-state compared to single dose suggesting that empagliflozin demonstrates linear 
pharmacokinetics. 
Assessment report  
EMA/238334/2015 
Page 27/99 
  
  
 
As the proposed dose is 10 and 25 mg, the deviation from linearity in the higher range is considered 
of no clinical relevance. 
As no unexpected accumulation occur after multiple doing of empagliflozin, time dependent changes 
in the pharmacokinetics are unlikely to occur. 
Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
The exposure of empagliflozin in T2DM patients do not differ in a clinical significant way from healthy 
subjects. By comparing the pharmacokinetic variables after single dose in healthy subject from with 
those of T2DM patients a slightly higher exposure was found in T2DM patients (Table ). These 
exposure differences are marginal and as empagliflozin also shows linear pharmacokinetics in both 
healthy volunteers and patients with T2DM, the observed minor differences in empagliflozin exposure 
are not expected to confine the applicability of healthy volunteer trial results to the patient population. 
Table 3 Comparison of pharmacokinetic variables after single dose in healthy subjects and 
T2DM patients  
Intrinsic factors 
The extent of exposure (AUC) is clearly affected by renal insufficiency. In mild and moderate 
impairment the exposure is increased by 30% and in patients with severe impairment by 70%. Also 
the half-life is increased in severe renal impaired patient in comparison with normal renal functions. 
This increase in exposure is mainly caused by less renal excretion of empagliflozin in these patients. 
As the active site of action of empagliflozin is the renal tubuli, the efficacy will be probably also be 
decreased in these patients as the glucose in urine is these patients is also decreased significantly.  
This higher exposure in renal impaired patients and the lower glucose excretion in these patients may 
be considered of no clinical relevance. This is based on the data of the Phase III study 1245.36 from 
which the Applicant claims that patients with moderate renal impairment did show a positive B/R 
ratio. 
The relationship between renal impairment and the exposure is shown in Figure .

Liver impairment affects the exposure of empagliflozin significantly. The extent as well as the rate of 
exposure increased by 80% in severe liver impaired patients in comparison with healthy subjects. 
This is not due to renal insufficiency, which may be also manifest in patients with liver impairment, as 
the amount excreted in urine is increased slightly also. No dose adjustment is considered necessary in 
these patients.  
The exposure to empagliflozin in Japanese and Chinese subjects is significant higher after multiple 
dosing of 25 mg orally than in Caucasian subjects. This may be due to differences in the weight as the 
subjects as the exposure to empagliflozin decrease by weight. 
The slight increase in exposure in patients over 65 years may be explained by a lesser renal function 
in these group of patients as renal impairment clearly affect the exposure of empagliflozin. It is 
therefore acceptable not to adjust the dose on the basis of age but more on the renal function. 
Weight and gender does not have clinical; significant effect on the exposure of empagliflozin. 
Interactions 
Potential drug-drug interactions of empagliflozin have been investigated in a number of phase I trials. 
The test substances were selected based on the properties of empagliflozin or as important and 
frequently prescribed co-medications in the target population. 
Empagliflozin pharmacokinetics were similar with and without co-administration of metformin, 
glimepiride, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, linagliptin, warfarin, verapamil, ramipril, simvastatin, 
hydrochlorothiazide, and torasemide. Overall exposure (AUC) of empagliflozin increased 1.6-fold 
following co-administration with gemfibrozil, 1.35-fold with rifampicin, and 1.5-fold with probenecid. 
The observed increases in the overall exposure of empagliflozin were not considered to be clinically 
significant. 
No dosage adjustment of empagliflozin is recommended when it is administered concomitantly with 
gemfibrozil, rifampicin, or probenecid. Therefore interaction on the level of the transporters OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, OATP2B1 and OAT3 are considered not clinical relevant. 
Empagliflozin had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glimepiride, 
pioglitazone, sitagliptin, linagliptin, warfarin, digoxin, ramipril, simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, 
torasemide, and oral contraceptives when co-administered with any of these drugs. 
As empagliflozin is a substrate for P-gp, however, an interaction study with a single dose of verapamil 
(a moderate inhibitor of P-gp) did show that P-gp has only a small effect on the exposure of 
empagliflozin.

Empagliflozin / metformin Fixed Dose Combination 
Bioequivalence and food effect 
The Applicant developed four different fixed dose combination (FDC) tablets containing empagliflozin 
and metformin: empagliflozin/metformin FDC Film-coated tablet 5 mg/850 mg, 5 mg/1,000 mg, 12.5 
mg/850 mg and 12.5 mg/1,000 mg. The empagliflozin/metformin FDC will be administered 
twice-daily due to the pharmacokinetic properties of metformin.  
To support this application the applicant has conducted three bioequivalence studies (1276.6, 1276.7, 
and 1276.8) in which FDC tablets were compared with individual tablets empagliflozin (5 mg and 12.5 
mg) and metformin (500 mg, 850 mg, and 1000 mg). 
•  Study 1276.6 was a bioequivalence study under fed conditions (high fat, high-caloric meal) 
comparing the pharmacokinetics of:  
o  12.5 mg empagliflozin/500 mg metformin (FDC) tablet with free dose combination of 10 mg + 2.5 
mg empagliflozin tablets, and 500 mg metformin (Glucophage)  
o  5 mg empagliflozin/ 500 mg metformin FDC tablet with free dose combination of 5 mg 
empagliflozin and 500 mg metformin (Glucophage) 
•  Study 1276.7 was a bioequivalence study under fed conditions (high fat, high-caloric meal) 
comparing the pharmacokinetics of : 
o  12.5 mg empagliflozin/850 mg metformin (FDC) tablet with free dose combination of 10 mg + 2.5 
mg empagliflozin, and 850mg metformin (Glucophage)  
o  5 mg empagliflozin/ 850 mg metformin FDC tablet with free dose combination of 5 mg 
empagliflozin and 850 mg metformin (Glucophage) 
•  Study 1276.8 was a randomised, open-label, crossover bioequivalence study under fed and 
fasted conditions. 
o  12.5 mg empagliflozin/1000 mg metformin (FDC) tablet with free dose combination of 12.5 mg 
empagliflozin and 1000 mg metformin (Glucophage) 
Bioequivalence has been established between FDC tablets and the free dose combinations in these 
bioequivalence studies (1276.6, 1276.7 and 1276.8). 
Administration of the new combination products shows to be bioequivalent with the separate 
compounds administered under fed conditions for all strengths combinations. Al 90% Confidence 
intervals for the rate and extent of absorption were within the required acceptance range of 0.80 - 
1.25. 
The highest strength is also bioequivalent under fasted conditions. 
The results of study 1276.8 demonstrates that food slightly affect the bioavailability of empagliflozin. 
The extent of exposure (AUC) is decreased by 10 - 15% and the rate of exposure Cmax) by 25%. 
Also the rate of absorption of metformin is reduced after food intake but the extent is not affected. 
This was already known for metformin. As metformin should be administered with food to reduce side 
effects, the combination with empagliflozin will be administered with food also. Therefore the small 
effect of food on the bioavailability of both compounds is considered not clinical relevant.

Interactions 
In a repeated oral administration study with 50 mg empagliflozin and 1000 mg metformin no 
interaction was found in the pharmacokinetics of both compounds. The extent and rate of absorption 
met the bioequivalence criteria for both empagliflozin and metformin. 
Comparison once daily vs twice daily dosing 
Twice daily administration of 5 mg or 10 mg empagliflozin compared with once daily 10 mg or 25 mg, 
respectively, results in a comparable extent of exposure over 24 hours (see Figure ). However, as can 
be expected the Cmax is significantly lower.  
To support twice daily dosing the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin administered twice-daily (5 mg 
or 12.5 mg) compared with once-daily (10 mg or 25 mg) as add-on therapy to a twice-daily dosing 
regimen of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes was evaluated in a 16-week placebo-controlled 
posology bridging trial (1276.10). In this study was shown that empagliflozin steady-state 
concentrations of empagliflozin were maintained during the course of the study. The trough plasma 
concentrations after repeated dosing were significant higher after twice daily dosing of 5 mg 
compared with 10 mg once daily. This is in line with the comparable extent of exposure between the 
two dosing regimens.

1276.9). 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Introduction  
Empagliflozin 
In patients with type 2 diabetes (trials 1245.2 and 1245.4), administration of empagliflozin resulted 
in a dose-dependent increase in urinary glucose excretion (UGE), which averaged about 78 g/day with 
25 mg empagliflozin once-daily. A plateau appeared to be reached at the 10 mg dose of empagliflozin 
once-daily. Increased urinary glucose excretion resulted in an immediate reduction in plasma glucose 
levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, increased UGE with empagliflozin treatment did not 
result in marked increases of urine volume. 
An exposure-response relationship for FPG and HbA1c was established using data from several phase 
II and III trials (1245.2, 1245.4, 1245.9, 1245.10, 1245.15, 1245.19, 1245.20, 1245.23, 1245.33, 
1245.36). The maximal observed decrease in FPG appeared to occur within 1 to 2 weeks after 
Assessment report  
EMA/238334/2015 
Page 31/99 
  
  
 
initiation of empagliflozin treatment. The maximal change in HbA1c following initiation of empagliflozin 
treatment was almost reached after 12 weeks.  
Single oral doses of 25 mg (therapeutic) and 200 mg empagliflozin (supra-therapeutic) were not 
associated with a prolongation of the QT(c) interval as demonstrated in a thorough QT trial in healthy 
subjects (trial 1245.16). 
Empagliflozin/metformin combination 
No dedicated pharmacodynamic or QT interval studies were conducted for the 
empagliflozin/metformin FDC because it can be assumed that the data reported for empagliflozin also 
apply to the FDC.  
The pharmacodynamics profile of empagliflozin has been characterised based on the results of ten 
clinical pharmacology studies, including one QT study. The information about pharmacodynamics in 
this dossier was previously assessed for Jardiance (empagliflozin) and is described in its EPAR 
(http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Public_assessment_report/hu
man/002677/WC500168594.pdf).  
Mechanism of action 
The kidney has a role in the regulation of blood glucose levels. Therefore the kidney can serve as a 
target for antidiabetic therapy. The sodium-dependent glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) is localized 
in the renal proximal tubules, accounting for approximately 90% of renal glucose reabsorption. It 
reabsorbs most of the ~ 180 g glucose filtered under normal conditions through the glomeruli per day. 
SGLT-2 inhibition decreases renal glucose reabsorption, promotes glycosuria and results in reduced 
levels of blood glucose. Empagliflozin selectively inhibits SGLT-2 in the kidney, resulting in direct, 
insulin-independent, elimination of glucose by the kidney. 
Primary pharmacology 
The urinary glucose excretion (UGE) is the main parameter assessed in the investigation of the 
pharmacodynamic profile of empagliflozin. The choice of urinary glucose excretion (UGE) as the main 
parameter in the investigation of the pharmacodynamics of empagliflozin is acceptable and crucial in 
view of its claimed mechanism of action. UGE has been assessed in three trials in healthy volunteers 
and in five trials in subjects with T2DM. 
From the three trials in healthy subjects it is concluded that oral administration of empagliflozin 
resulted in a dose-dependent increase in UGE. In healthy volunteers, UGE was higher with all doses 
(0.5 mg to 800 mg) compared with placebo (see Figure ). Following a single oral administration of 
empagliflozin, up to 91 g of glucose was excreted in urine. Empagliflozin inhibited reabsorption of 
<40% of filtered glucose with single daily doses up to 10 mg and approximately 40–60% of filtered 
glucose at higher doses, with the effect reaching a plateau at around the 100 mg dose. At doses less 
than 50 mg, the majority of glucose was excreted in the first 24 h, but at doses of 100 mg and above, 
glucose excretion continued for up to 48–72 h. The time to reach the maximum rate of UGE was 7 h 
in most subjects and was similar in all dose groups. 
It is concluded that empagliflozin can induce sustained, dose-dependent glycosuria in healthy 
subjects.

Figure 4 Mean cumulative amounts of glucose excreted in urine following administration 
of single oral doses of 0.5 mg to 800 mg empagliflozin in healthy volunteers 
In Caucasian, Japanese and Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes administration of empagliflozin 
results in a dose-dependent increase in urinary glucose excretion. UGE increases immediately 
following the first dose of empagliflozin, is observed over the entire 24-h dosing interval and is 
maintained at the end of a 4-week treatment period. It averages at about 78 g/day with 25 mg 
empagliflozin once daily. A plateau appears to be reached at the 10 mg dose of empagliflozin once 
daily. It should be noted that the rates of UGE in the empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg groups were 
similar. Increased UGE with empagliflozin treatment does not result in marked increases of urine 
volume. 
In healthy volunteers empagliflozin does not have any effect on plasma glucose levels despite of 
increased glycosuria. In patients with T2DM empagliflozin reduces plasma glucose in a more or less 
dose dependent fashion, but the differences between 10 and 25 mg are not significant. 
With empagliflozin, cumulative amounts of glucose in urine decrease with renal impairment. However 
due to limited data the impact of lowered glomerular filtration rate on plasma glucose in T2DM as well 
as the safety aspects are further assessed in clinical studies. 
In patient with hepatic impairment UGE was not affected; it was similar in subjects with liver 
impairment and subjects with normal hepatic function. 
No effect of empagliflozin on serum insulin was observed during 8-day treatment of patients with 
T2DM with empagliflozin. Insulin AUEC and Emax were similar with and without empagliflozin 
treatment at all dose levels. However, after 24 weeks of treatment with empagliflozin (10 and 25 mg 
doses) reductions from baseline compared with placebo are observed for fasting plasma insulin. 
Following treatment with empagliflozin reductions in plasma levels of 1,5-AG are observed in T2DM 
reflecting the effect on glucose levels. Fructosamine levels decreased. However, the observed 
changes were not significantly different from placebo. There were no consistent trends in changes 
observed in glucagon levels with empagliflozin treatment. 
Secondary pharmacology 
Effects of empagliflozin on QT interval were investigated in Trial 1245.6. A total of 30 male and female 
subjects were randomised to receive 25 mg empagliflozin (therapeutic dose), 200 mg empagliflozin 
Assessment report  
EMA/238334/2015 
Page 33/99 
  
  
 
(supratherapeutic dose), 400 mg moxifloxacin (positive control), or 2 times placebo. Single oral doses 
of 25 mg (therapeutic) and 200 mg empagliflozin (supra-therapeutic) in healthy subjects are not 
associated with prolongation of the QT interval. The primary endpoint was mean change from baseline 
(MCfB) in the population heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTcN) between 1–4 h after dosing. The 
placebo-corrected adjusted mean change from baseline in QTcN within the time interval 1 – 4 h after 
dosing was 0.59 ms (90% CI: -0.69, 1.87) for 25 mg empagliflozin and -0.22 ms (90% CI: -1.39, 
0.94) for 200 mg empagliflozin. The difference in the mean QTcN change from baseline between 2 h 
and 4 h after administration of moxifloxacin vs. placebo was 12.42 ms with a lower 90% CI of 10.7 ms 
clearly above zero. Also the analysis of the primary endpoint by gender and analyses of secondary 
endpoints indicated the absence of a clinically relevant increase from baseline in the mean QTcN 
interval. It is concluded that empagliflozin has no effect on QT-interval. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
There was no additional analysis investigating the exposure-response relationship for the FDC. 
Empagliflozin showed linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose range from 0.5 mg to 800 mg with 
single oral doses and from 2.5 mg to 100 mg with multiple daily doses. As such, the results of this 
study are considered to be valid for 10 mg and 25 mg daily doses investigated in the Phase III 
program. 
No separate discussion of the plasma-concentration-effect relationship was found. However, based on 
linear PK, the concentration-effect curve will be similar to the dose-effect curve (see F#1). 
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances  
There were no dedicated studies/analyses investigating the effect of a empagliflozin/ metformin FDC 
tablet on the PK of other medications or vice versa. It can be, however, assumed that the same 
conditions, limitations and dose adjustments as reported for the single entities (see Section 1.1.1) will 
also apply to the FDC. This is concluded based on the absence of a clinically relevant interaction 
between empagliflozin and metformin. 
Similarly, there were no dedicated studies/analyses investigating any possible PD interactions.  
For the FDC, no new (PK or PD) interaction studies are reported. The discussion in the SmPC is based 
on the separate components.  
Genetic differences in PD response 
In healthy subjects and in Caucasian, Japanese and Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes 
administration of empagliflozin results in a dose-dependent increase in urinary glucose excretion 
(UGE). UGE increases immediately following the first dose of empagliflozin, is observed over the 
entire 24-h dosing interval and is maintained at the end of a 4-week treatment period. It averages at 
about 78 g/day with 25 mg empagliflozin once daily. A plateau appears to be reached at the 10 mg 
dose of empagliflozin once daily. There are no differences between Japanese, Chinese and Caucasian 
subjects. 
In healthy Caucasian and Japanese subjects empagliflozin does not influence plasma glucose. In 
Japanese and Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes as well as in Caucasian patients administration of 
empagliflozin reduces plasma glucose. 
There are no arguments to conclude genetic differences between Caucasian, Japanese and Chinese 
subjects concerning serum insulin, 1,5-Anhydroglucitol, fructosamine or glucagon during 
administration of empagliflozin. 
Assessment report

There are no differences between Japanese, Chinese and Caucasian subjects. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin alone and in combination with metformin are well investigated 
and characterised. The exposure of empagliflozin in T2DM patients do not differ in a clinical significant 
way from healthy subjects. By comparing the pharmacokinetic variables after single dose in healthy 
subject with those of T2DM patients, a slightly higher exposure was found in T2DM patients 
The FDC is considered bioequivalent with both separate compounds and the effect of food is not 
changed for both compounds with respect to empagliflozin alone of metformin alone. 
In a repeated oral administration study with 50 mg empagliflozin and 1000 mg metformin no 
interaction was found in the pharmacokinetics of both compounds. The extent and rate of absorption 
met the bioequivalence criteria for both empagliflozin and metformin. 
Twice daily administration of 5 mg or 10 mg empagliflozin compared with one daily 10 mg or 25 mg, 
respectively, results in a comparable extent of exposure over 24 hours. However, as can be expected, 
the Cmax is significant lower. The trough plasma concentrations after repeated dosing are significant 
higher after twice daily dosing of 5 mg compared with 10 mg one daily. This is in line with the 
comparable extent of exposure between the two dosing regimes. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacodynamics of the compound have been assessed in healthy volunteers, in Caucasian, 
Japanese and Chinese subjects with T2DM and also in T2DM patients with renal and hepatic 
impairment. This is considered an adequate approach. 
In healthy subjects and in Caucasian, Japanese and Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes 
administration of empagliflozin results in a dose-dependent increase in urinary glucose excretion 
(UGE). UGE increases immediately following the first dose of empagliflozin, is observed over the 
entire 24-h dosing interval and is maintained at the end of a 4-week treatment period. It averages at 
about 78 g/day with 25 mg empagliflozin once daily. A plateau appears to be reached at the 10 mg 
dose of empagliflozin once daily. No significant differences were found between 10 mg and 25 mg. In 
the clinical studies the 10 mg as well as the 25 mg dose have been studied. This is justified for an 
optimal dose selection. 
In healthy volunteers empagliflozin does not have any effect on plasma glucose levels despite 
increased glycosuria. However in patients with T2DM empagliflozin reduces plasma glucose in a more 
or less dose dependent fashion. 
In renal impairment with empagliflozin, cumulative amounts of glucose in urine decrease, which can 
be expected base on the mechanism of action. However due to limited data the impact of lowered 
glomerular filtration rate on plasma glucose in T2DM as well as the safety aspects should be further 
assessed in clinical studies. 
In patients with liver impairment on the basis of pharmacokinetic results no dosage adjustment of 
empagliflozin can be recommended. The impact of liver impairment on plasma glucose in T2DM as 
well as the safety aspects are further assessed in phase III studies (see below). 
A thorough QT study indicates that single oral doses of 25 mg (therapeutic) and 200 mg empagliflozin 
(supra-therapeutic) in healthy subjects are not associated with prolongation of the QT interval. 
Assessment report  
EMA/238334/2015 
Page 35/99 
  
  
It is concluded that the data concerning pharmacodynamics of empagliflozin indicate efficacy of the 
compound in the treatment of T2DM. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
PK and PD of empagliflozin are adequately characterised and show the characteristics of a SGLT2 
inhibitor. Dose-response data supported the use of 10 and 25 mg in the phase III studies. 
There are no indications of an interaction between empagliflozin and metformin.

The ‘pivotal’ trials in EFF-C1 provide the evidence for use of the proposed FDC in patients not using 
insulin. Both trials in EFF-C2 (1245.33 and 1245.49) provide the evidence for use of the proposed FDC 
in patients using one or more insulin injections per day. In this sense they can also be considered 
‘pivotal’. Active comparator trial 1245.28 shows durability of efficacy. 
Posology bridging trial 1276.10 
Study 1276.10 was the only study submitted for this application that was not previously assessed.  
Study 1276.10 was a 16-week posology bridging trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of different 
dose regimens of empagliflozin (twice daily versus once daily), administered orally as add-on therapy 
to immediate release metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes and insufficient glycaemic control. 
The study was designed to test non-inferiority of: empagliflozin 5 mg twice daily versus 10 mg once 
daily; and empagliflozin 12.5 mg twice daily versus empagliflozin 25 mg once daily. The superiority of 
all 4 empagliflozin dose regimens versus placebo was also tested.  
The Study was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group comparison. 
Randomisation was stratified by HbA1c, renal function at screening, assessed based on eGFR values 
(according to MDRD staging criteria), and geographical region. A 2-week single-label placebo run-in 
period preceded randomisation. Patients were to be followed-up for 1 week after end-of-treatment. 
The study was conducted in compliance with the EMA SA received in February 2011 suggesting to 
conduct a direct comparison of clinical efficacy of empagliflozin at the two different dose regimens in 
patients failing on optimized metformin monotherapy and to obtain additional comparative data on 
safety and pharmacokinetics.  
Overall, the inclusion and exclusion criteria are similar to those used in previous studies in T2DM 
patients and are acceptable.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint (change from baseline in HbA1c after 16 weeks of treatment) and secondary 
endpoints (change from baseline in FPG after 16 weeks of treatment) are in line with the 
recommendations in the guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment or 
prevention of diabetes mellitus (CPMP/EWP/1080/00 Rev. 1) and are consistent with the primary and 
secondary endpoints in previous studies with empagliflozin.  
Statistical analysis 
Based on previous experience with empagliflozin, it was estimated that the standard deviation of 
change in HbA1c from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment would be 0.66%. The Applicant defined a 
non-inferiority margin equal to 0.35% that was established by the results of a previous study (Study 
1245.10). This is acceptable for non -inferiority comparisons. For superiority testing a minimal clinical 
difference versus placebo was set to 0.6%.

Baseline characteristics 
A total of 1626 patients were screened by 139 centres in 18 countries. Overall, the majority of 
patients (93.2%) completed the 16-week treatment period and 6.8% prematurely discontinued trial 
medication. The number of patients who discontinued medication due to adverse events was higher in 
the empagliflozin 10 mg qd group as compared with the other groups.  
Overall, the patients enrolled in study 1276.10 were representative of the target population in terms 
of demographic characteristics, (62.9%) were from Europe. Details are reported in Table 5  below:  
Table 5 Demographic Data - Trial 1276.10 - FAS 
Overall, the patients enrolled in study 1276.10 were representative of the target population in terms 
of severity and duration of diabetes as well as BMI with the majority of patients being overweight or 
obese. Over half (64.9%) of all patients had an HbA1c <8%, and only a minority (9%) had an HbA1c 
≥9%. Mean blood pressure values were within the recommended targets for patients with diabetes.  
It was noted that 55 patients had moderate or severe renal impairment (eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73m2 
[MDRD]), which is not in accordance with the inclusion criteria (excluding patients with eGFR <60 
ml/min/1.73m2 according to Cockcroft-Gault formula . The MAH should justify the inclusion of the 
group of renal impaired patients defined as having an eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73m2 MDRD in the study.

The treatment groups seem to be well balanced, with the exception of HbA1c cut-off levels distribution 
among groups: more patients had an HbA1c <8% in the placebo group as compared with the other 
groups (73.8% in the placebo group vs. 67.0%, 64.0%, 64.2% and 59.8% in the empagliflozin 12.5, 
25, 5 and 10 mg, groups, respectively), whereas the proportion of patients with an HbA1c between 8 
and 9% was lower in the placebo group as compared with other groups (16.8% in the placebo group 
vs. 24.7%, 24.1, 23.7% and 33.6% in the empagliflozin 12.5, 25, 5 and 10 mg groups, respectively). 
This unbalance would not impact efficacy results from the primary endpoint and other secondary 
endpoints (changes of HbA1c level from baseline) but it would impact the secondary efficacy 
endpoint ”proportion of patients with HbA1c <7.0% after 16 weeks of treatment” in favour of placebo. 
Details of baseline efficacy variables across treatment groups (FAS) are shown in table 6 below. 
Table 6 - Trial 1276.10 - FAS 
Antidiabetic background medication: the most commonly introduced antidiabetic therapy was 
sulphonylurea, followed by DPP-IV inhibitor and insulin.  
All patients were on metformin IR ≥1500 mg daily, consistent with the inclusion criteria.

Results 
Primary endpoint:  
The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c after 16 weeks  
Non-inferiority of empagliflozin 12.5 mg twice daily versus 25 mg once daily (-0.11, 95%CI 0.26-0.03) 
as well as that of empagliflozin 5 mg twice daily versus 10 mg once daily (-0.02, CI 95% -0.16-0.13) 
was demonstrated (Table 7). 
Table 7 Change from baseline in HbA1c after 16 weeks - Trial 1276.10 – FAS (LOCF) 
A treatment comparison of the adjusted mean change in HbA1c from baseline after 16 weeks was also 
performed for the FAS (OC) using the MMRM model. The changes from baseline in HbA1c in the 
empagliflozin+metformin groups were consistent with the primary analysis performed for the FAS 
(LOCF) using an ANCOVA model. 
Testing for superiority of all 4 empagliflozin doses versus placebo showed statistical significant 
reductions in HbA1c for all empagliflozin tested doses (p<0.001 for each comparison). Observed 
reductions were comparable across groups, however a better treatment effect was obtained with the 
high dose (12.5mg) at twice daily regimen.  
Subgroup analysis:  
Consistent with the results for the FAS, subgroup analyses suggests that a better trend in HbA1c 
reduction at week 16 across subgroup analyses is obtained with the 12.5 mg bid dose as compared 
with the 25 mg qd dose of empagliflozin. With regard to subgroup analysis according to BMI 
categories, empagliflozin showed significant treatment effect in reducing HbA1c at week 16 when 
compared to placebo in the BMI category 30 to<35 and at lesser extend in the BMI category 25 to <30. 
In both BMI categories, empagliflozin high dose twice daily showed the best effect. 
Secondary endpoints 
FPG change from baseline: significant and clinically meaningful reductions in FPG were observed with 
all empagliflozin doses as compared with placebo, which supports the primary outcome. A slightly 
Assessment report  
EMA/238334/2015

larger reduction in FPG was observed with the twice daily regimens (5mg or 12.5mg) as compared 
with the corresponding once daily regimens. (see table 8 below) 
Table 8 Change from baseline in FPG [mg/dl] after 16 weeks - Trial 1276.10 – FAS (LOCF) 
Exploratory endpoints 
The proportions of patients on empagliflozin bid with HbA1c <7% after 16 weeks were comparable 
with the proportions of patients on empagliflozin qd and significantly greater as compared with the 
proportion of patients with HbA1c <7% in the placebo group. Results from other exploratory 
endpoints, such as body weight and systolic blood pressure, showed similar treatment effect of the 
twice versus once daily regimens. Of note, treatment impact on blood pressure changes was clinically 
irrelevant. In addition, the proportion of patients with rescue medication was very low and similar 
across empagliflozin treatment groups. No patient had an increase in background medication. 
Ancillary analyses 
Consistent with the results for the FAS, subgroup analyses (i.e. by metformin dose, time since 
diagnosis, HbA1C baseline, BMI) suggests that a better trend in HbA1c reduction at week 16 across 
subgroup analyses is obtained with the 12.5 mg bid dose as compared with the 25 mg qd dose of 
empagliflozin.  
With regard to subgroup analysis according to BMI categories, empagliflozin showed significant 
treatment effect in reducing HbA1c at week 16 when compared to placebo in the BMI category 30 
to<35 and at lesser extend in the BMI category 25 to <30. In both BMI categories, empagliflozin high 
dose twice daily showed the best effect. (see figure 5 below).

Studies in special populations 
Study 1245.36 in patients with renal insufficiency has limited relevance for this application, as 
subjects with eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m2 are contraindicated to metformin and also to this FDC. A 
summary table of this trial is included below 
Supportive studies 
Study 1275.1(met) is part of the empagliflozin/linagliptin FDC development programme. Only patients 
from trial 1275.1 (met) are included for efficacy evaluation in this report. Specifically, the relevant 
comparison from this study in the context of the current application is the empagliflozin/linagliptin 
FDC+metformin versus linagliptin+metformin. A summary table of this trial is included below. 
Trial 1245.28 was a long-term active-controlled trial, comparing empagliflozin to glimeperide. This 
trial is also considered supportive and a summary table of this trial is included below. 
•  Summary of main efficacy results 
The following tables summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present 
application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as 
well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections).

Table 12 Summary of efficacy for trial 1245.28 (Supportive trial) 
Title:  
A phase III randomised, double–blind, active–controlled parallel group efficacy 
and safety study of BI 10773 compared to glimepiride administered orally during 
104 weeks with a 104–week extension period in patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus and insufficient glycaemic control despite metformin treatment 
Study identifier 
1245.28 
Design 
The objective was to investigate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of empa 
25 mg daily compared with glimepiride 1 to 4 mg daily administered over 104 
weeks as add–on therapy to immediate release met with a 104–week extension 
period in patients with type 2 diabetes and insufficient glycaemic control despite 
treatment with met. 
This is a randomised, double–blind, active–controlled, parallel–group 
comparison study. Randomisation was stratified by HbA1c at screening, renal 
function at screening, and geographical region. 
Duration 
Main phase: 
104 weeks 
Run–in phase: 
2 weeks 
Extension phase:  104 weeks 
Follow up: 
4 weeks  
Hypothesis 
Non–inferiority vs. glimepiride was performed using an ANCOVA model. If 
non–inferiority for HbA1c was established, tests for the superiority of empa vs. 
glimepiride with regard to the key secondary endpoints were to be conducted in 
hierarchical order: change in body weight, occurrence of confirmed 
hypoglycaemic AEs, change in SBP, change in DBP, all at Week 104

Table 13 Summary of efficacy for trial 1245.31 
Title:  
A phase III double–blind, extension, placebo–controlled parallel group safety and 
efficacy trial of empagliflozin (10 and 25 mg once daily) and sitagliptin (100 mg 
once daily) given for minimum 76 weeks (including 24 weeks of preceding trial)

diabetes mellitus previously completing trial 1245.19, 1245.20 or 1245.23 
Study identifier 
Study 1245.31 
Design 
This extension study combines 4 studies under one study number, which varied 
with regard to background therapy (drug–naive patients and patients on 3 
different background therapies, i.e. pioglitazone, metformin only, or metformin 
plus sulfonylurea). The objective was to investigate the long–term efficacy, 
safety, and tolerability of empagliflozin compared with placebo in patients with 
type 2 diabetes. Each study was designed as a randomised, double–blind, active 
or placebo–controlled, parallel group comparison. Patients continued on the 
treatment to which they had been randomised in the preceding trial; no 
re–randomisation was performed in the extension trial. All analyses were 
performed separately for each of the 4 studies. All data of the respective 
preceding trial were combined with the data obtained up to the interim database 
lock in this extension trial. No separate analysis of the extension trial was 
performed. Patients from the preceding trials were included in the analyses 
irrespective of participation in the extension.

Title:  
A phase IIb, randomized, double–blind, placebo–controlled, parallel group, 
safety and efficacy study of BI 10773 (10 mg and 25 mg) administered orally, 
once daily over 78 weeks in type 2 diabetic patients receiving treatment with 
basal insulin (glargine, detemir, or NPH insulin only) with or without concomitant 
metformin and/or sulfonylurea therapy and insufficient glycemic control 
Study identifier 
1245.33 
Design 
The objective was to investigate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and 
pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes in combination 
with background basal insulin therapy (glargine, detemir, or NPH insulin only) at 
a fixed dose for 18 weeks (except for rescue therapy), and at an adjustable dose 
for 60 weeks with ± concomitant metformin and/or SU therapy compared with 
placebo over 78 weeks 
This was a randomised, double–blind, placebo–controlled, parallel–group 
comparison study. Randomisation was stratified by HbA1c at screening. The 
main endpoints and – were analysed with an ANCOVA (LOCF) model on the FAS. 
Safety data were analysed mainly descriptively.

Results 
The 25 mg dose resulted in a numerically larger reduction than 10 mg empagliflozin). In the 
empagliflozin groups, 18.0% (10 mg) and 19.5% (25 mg) of patients achieved an HbA1c value below 
7.0%, compared with 5.5% of patients in the placebo group. 
 As could be expected, diabetes duration was longer than in studies in patients not using insulin. In 
addition, there were reductions in body weight with both doses of empagliflozin at Week 18 that were 
sustained through Week 78; the difference versus placebo for the adjusted mean change in body 
weight from baseline at Week 78 –3.63 kg for the empagliflozin 10 mg group and –3.12 kg for the 
empagliflozin 25 mg group. 
It should be noted that the changes in insulin dose were small and not clinically relevant. In addition, 
there was a remarkable difference in baseline HbA1c between the groups. Compared to the placebo, 
HbA1c was 0.16% and 0.24% higher in the empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg groups, respectively. This 
may have caused an overestimation of treatment effects. Nevertheless, the changes in HbA1c are 
considered clinically relevant.

Title:  
A phase III randomized, double–blind, placebo–controlled, parallel group safety 
and efficacy study of BI 10773 (10 mg and 25 mg administered orally once daily) 
during 52 weeks in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and insufficient

Study identifier 
1245.49 
Design 
The objective was to investigate the safety and efficacy of empagliflozin (10 mg 
or 25 mg once daily) compared with placebo, added to an insulin regimen of 
multiple daily injections (MDI) alone or with metformin in patients with type 2 
diabetes and insufficient glycaemic control 
This was a randomised, double–blind, placebo–controlled, treat–to–target, 
parallelgroup comparison. Randomisation was stratified by HbA1c, eGFR, 
background medication at Visit 1, and geographic region. The total randomised 
treatment period was 52 weeks. From Week 1 to Week 18, patients were to 
maintain a stable insulin dose with trial treatment added. From Week 19 to 40, 
treat–to–target insulin dose adjustments were to be made as needed in order to 
achieve glucose treat–to–target values (pre–prandial <100 mg/dL [5.5 mmol/l] 
and postprandial <140 mg/dL [7.8 mmol/l]). From Week 41 to Week 52, patients 
were to maintain a stable insulin dose, and adjustments were to be made for 
safety reasons only. 
Different LOCF approaches were used at Week 18 and at Week 52 (LOCF–18 and 
LOCF–52).

for HbA1c) were analysed with an 
ANCOVA similar to that described for 
the primary endpoint, on the 
per–protocol completers set of 
patients at Week 52 
(PPS–completers–52).  
A total of 566 patients were randomised in a 1:1:1:1 ratio and 563 patients were treated. Overall, 
15.6% of the treated patients prematurely discontinued study medication. The proportion of male 
patients was 45.5%. Most patients were White (94.3%). The mean (SD) age was 56.7 (9.5) years, 
the mean baseline HbA1c 8.34% (0.73%), the mean BMI 34.79 (4.06) kg/m2, the mean baseline 
body weight 96.2 (17.5) kg, the mean SBP (SD) 133.3 (15.5) mmHg, and the mean DBP (SD) 78.8 
(8.6) mmHg. Overall, 71.0% of patients had a combined MDI insulin+met antidiabetic background 
medication (65.7% of all patients in the FAS had ≥1500 mg metformin per day) and 29.0% of 
patients had an MDI insulin only antidiabetic background medication. The mean daily met dose (SD) 
was 2026.8 (542.2) mg. 
Overall, 78.0% of patients had a history of hypertension, with controlled BP in 29.7% of patients. Two 
thirds of all patients had had type 2 diabetes for >10 years at study entry. The demographics and 
baseline characteristics were generally balanced across treatment groups. 
All the steps in the hierarchical testing sequence were successful and treatment with both 
empagliflozin doses showed statistical superiority compared with placebo.

Results 
At Week 24, a total of 686 patients were randomised in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio and all were treated. Overall, 
8.5% of the treated patients prematurely discontinued study medication at Week 24. Overall, the 
proportion of male patients was 53.7%. Most patients were White (73.9%). The mean (SD) age was 
56.2 (10.2) years, the mean baseline HbA1c was 7.98 (0.85%), the mean BMI was 30.98 (5.45) 
kg/m2, the mean baseline body weight was 86.2 (18.7) kg, the mean SBP (SD) was 130.1 (14.3) 
mmHg, and the mean DBP (SD) was 79.1 (8.9) mmHg. The mean daily met dose (SD) was 1889.0 
(470.9) mg. Most patients (35.6%) had had type 2 diabetes for 1 to 5 years at study entry. The 
demographics and baseline characteristics were generally balanced across treatment groups. 
At Week 52, of the total 686 randomised and treated patients, 12.4% prematurely discontinued study 
medication.

Title:  
A randomised, double–blind, placebo controlled, parallel group efficacy and 
safety study of oral administration of empagliflozin twice daily versus once daily 
in two different daily doses over 16 weeks as add–on therapy to a twice daily 
dosing regimen of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 
insufficient glycaemic control 
Study identifier 
1276.10 
Design 
The objective was to investigate the efficacy and safety of different dosages of 
empagliflozin administered twice daily versus once daily (at both dose levels, 
10 mg and 25 mg daily), orally as add–on therapy to immediate release 
metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes and insufficient glycaemic control. 
This was a randomised, double–blind, placebo–controlled, parallel group 
comparison. Patients were recruited and randomised with their background 
medication. Randomisation (2:2:2:2:1) was stratified by HbA1c, renal function 
at screening, assessed based on eGFR values (according to MDRD staging 
criteria), and geographical region.  
Duration

Results 
A total of 983 patients were randomised and all were treated. Overall, 6.8% of the treated patients 
prematurely discontinued study medication. The proportion of male patients was 53.9%. Most 
patients were White (85.9%). Mean (SD) age was 58.2 (10.3) years, baseline HbA1c was 7.77

Dose selection 
•  Metformin dose 
The dose recommendations for metformin are consistent with its approved label. The 500 mg 
metformin tablets will not available in line with previous CHMP decisions although it could be helpful 
in subjects experiencing GI complaints on metformin.  
•  Empagliflozin dose 
Dose selection for the monotherapy phase III program was mostly based on the randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled phase IIb trials 1245.9 and 1245.10. In trial 1245.9 empagliflozin 
(up to 25 mg once daily) was administered as monotherapy and in trial 1245.10, empagliflozin (up to 
50 mg once daily) was administered as add-on therapy to a background regimen of metformin. All 
doses were well tolerated and showed a good safety profile. The primary endpoint HbA1c in trials 
1245.9 and 1245.10 was the change from baseline in HbA1c after 12 weeks. In study 1245.9, an 
open-label metformin group was included (2x1000 mg, or maximum tolerated dose). In study 
1245.10, an open-label sitagliptin group was included (100 mg). 
In trial 1245.9, in which empagliflozin was administered as monotherapy, the differences between 
empagliflozin and placebo in the adjusted mean changes from baseline in HbA1c after 12 weeks 
increased with increasing dose of empagliflozin and were: -0.52% (5 mg), -0.57% (10 mg), 
and -0.72% (25 mg). The effect on the HbA1c level was highest in the metformin group (-0.85%). 
In trial 1245.10, in which empagliflozin was administered as add-on therapy to background 
medication with metformin, the differences between empagliflozin and placebo in the adjusted mean 
changes from baseline in HbA1c after 12 weeks were -0.24% (1 mg), -0.39% (5 mg), -0.71% 
(10 mg), -0.70% (25 mg), and -0.64% (50 mg). 
Thus, in the dose findings studies, the 25 mg dose of empagliflozin provided better efficacy than the 
10 mg dose. The 50 mg dose was only investigated in study 1245.10. In this study, there was no 
Assessment report  
EMA/238334/2015 
Page 68/99 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
additional benefit of the 50 mg dose in terms of efficacy. The selection of the 10 mg and 25 mg dose 
for the phase III studies was reasonable.  
In each of the pivotal phase III trials except for 1245.23 (met+SU) the reduction in HbA1c from 
baseline at 24 weeks was greater for empagliflozin 25 mg than for empagliflozin 10 mg. The pooled 
data of the pivotal trials (EFF-2) showed that the adjusted mean change from baseline in HbA1c after 
24 weeks of treatment was -0.70% for empagliflozin 10 mg and -0.76% for empagliflozin 25 mg. 
Although the 25 mg performed better, the lower dose also showed clinically significant changes in 
HbA1c. During the MAA procedure for empagliflozin it was agreed to use the 10 mg dose as a starting 
dose and escalate the dose based on tolerability. This approach is supported from a clinical efficacy 
and safety point of view. 
•  Once daily vs twice daily dosing 
Study 1276.10 was designed in line with comments in the EMA SA related to the ongoing factorial 
design trial 1276.1. This latter study is required by US FDA to cover the indication label for such FDC 
in the US (Adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with T2DM when 
treatment with both empagliflozin and metformin is appropriate). This trial can only be regarded 
‘supportive’ for the EU “as the trial will not provide information about the efficacy/safety in the 
intended population (patients failing on optimized metformin monotherapy up to 3000 mg daily) nor 
about equivalence of the 12.5 mg bid versus 25 mg qd administration”. Therefore, CHMP advised to 
include a 5 mg bid arm to compare the clinical efficacy with 10 mg qd. In addition, it was strongly 
recommended to compare 12.5 mg bid and 25 mg qd directly. 
Trial 1276.10 was powered to show non-inferiority of the bid versus the qd treatment regimen with 
empagliflozin in T2DM patients after 16 weeks, with the latter regimen being the reference regimen 
for the phase 3 add-on to metformin studies from the empagliflozin monotherapy program. The 
results of the trial showed non-inferiority of twice daily versus once daily empagliflozin regimens for 
both daily doses of 10 and 25 mg (Figure 1 B). The non-inferiority margin of 0.35% HbA1c is 
reasonable.

B Difference between treatments 
Dashed red lines represent non-inferiority margins mentioned in text, ±0.30%, +0.35%. 
Numerically larger reductions in HbA1c from baseline were observed for 12.5 mg bid compared to 
25 mg qd while no difference was observed between the 5 mg bid and 10 mg qd regimens. In order 
to approve a ‘switch indication’ for patients already treated with separate tablets of 25 mg 
empagliflozin and metformin, equivalence in PK/PD has to be shown in line with regulatory 
requirements. The applicant performed a post-hoc equivalence exercise. When using the predefined 
non-inferiority margin of 0.35% as equivalence margins, the treatments would be considered 
equivalent. The margin can be tightened to 0.30% but this may be data-driven. Still, therapeutic 
equivalence of the treatments can be assumed, although this was not formally proven. There is no 
discussion or claim with regard to switching from twice daily treatment to once daily empagliflozin in 
the proposed SmPC; the treatments are called “similar” and numbers are mentioned in the SmPC. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses AND meta-analysis) 
Based on trial 1276.10, the results of the main trials with once daily dosing of empagliflozin can be 
applied to the proposed FDC and a twice daily dosing regimen. Insulin was included in the background 
therapy for trials 1245.33 and 1245.49 (EFF C2) but not for 1245.23(met), 1245.23(met+SU) and 
1245.19 (EFF-C1). 
•  Methods 
Population 
Taken together, the development program provides sufficient information about the target population, 
both in subjects without and with concomitant insulin. 
Primary endpoint 
The trials critical for the evaluation of efficacy used the same primary endpoint to assess antidiabetic 
efficacy: the change from baseline in HbA1c. Exceptions were the double-blind extensions of the 
pivotal trials (1245.31), in which HbA1c was a secondary endpoint (confirmatory testing was done 
only in the preceding trials). Another exception was the cardiovascular safety trial 1245.25, which had 
a safety-related primary endpoint; the change from baseline in HbA1c was an exploratory endpoint. 
In all trials, blood samples for the determination of HbA1c were analysed in central laboratories that 
held a National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program Level I certificate. 
Secondary endpoints 
Four endpoints were considered secondary endpoints for the pooled analyses of efficacy, i.e. the 
changes from baseline in FPG, body weight, SBP, and DBP. On trial level, FPG was a key secondary 
endpoint in the pivotal trial 1245.19, and body weight was a key secondary endpoint in the 4 pivotal 
trials and in the glimepiride-controlled trial 1245.28. SBP and DBP were defined as key secondary 
endpoints in trials 1245.20 and 1245.28. Furthermore, in trial 1245.48 (patients with diabetes and 
hypertension), 24-h SBP was a co-primary endpoint and 24-h DBP was a key secondary endpoint. 
These key secondary endpoints were part of the testing hierarchy of the respective trial. Thus, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/238334/2015 
Page 70/99 
  
  
 
trial-level results for these endpoints provide confirmatory evidence. The analyses of other secondary 
endpoints on trial level were regarded as exploratory analyses. 
Sample Size 
The sample size calculations for the main trials were acceptable. The studies were designed with high 
power. With hindsight, the trials could have included less patients, based on the high statistical 
significance of the results. 
As designed, 1276.10 would guarantee preservation of 30% of the treatment effect, which was 
estimated as 0.70% (-0.91% to -0.50%) resulting in a guaranteed minimal effect of  
(-0.50) —(-0.35%).= (-0.15%). Such a treatment effect would likely be considered insufficient. 
However, based on the trial’s results showing a numerical advantage for twice daily treatment, this 
issue is not further pursued (Figure 1 B). 
Analysis populations 
The analysis sets used use common definitions. The primary analysis was performed according to ITT 
and used the FAS, all randomised patients receiving at least one dose of trial medication and having 
a baseline HbA1c measurement (for trial 1275.19) and at least one dose of trial medication (for trials 
1275.1 and 1275.10). 
As study 1276.10 was a non-inferiority study, the analysis should have been performed co-primary on 
both the ITT-set and the PP-set. But as results in the PP-set resembled the ITT results, and the trial 
also tested for differences against placebo, this is not considered a problem. 
Primary analysis 
The primary analysis was based on the change from baseline HbA1c values in the FAS set, using 
ANCOVA with baseline HbA1c as covariate and treatment, baseline renal function and region as fixed 
factors. This is considered acceptable. As sensitivity analyses this was repeated on the PP set, and 
using a MMRM approach on the FAS, which is considered acceptable. 
Disposition of patients 
The rates of premature discontinuations of trial medication were low (17.2%) in all pivotal trials, with 
a consistently higher discontinuation rate in the placebo groups than in the empagliflozin 10 mg and 
25 mg groups. The most frequent reasons for premature discontinuations were adverse events (other 
than worsening of disease under study or other pre-existing disease). Discontinuation rates were 
similar for the other phase III trials. 
Long-term efficacy analyses (>24 weeks) of the pivotal trials and their double-blind extensions 
(1245.31) were based on the pooling of the pivotal trials. Of all patients randomised and treated in the 
pivotal trials, 82.8% completed treatment in the 24-week pivotal trials as planned and 77.3% 
continued into the extension trials. 
Handling of missing data 
For the primary and secondary analyses, a last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach was 
used to replace missing data. LOCF is not considered as an optimal method for the primary analysis, 
as the assumptions are quite strong and hard to prove. However, in this case, the results are not likely 
to be influenced much by the LOCF approach because of the relatively low rate of missing data, and 
the supportive evidence from the sensitivity analyses. 
Conduct of the studies 
The use of stratified randomisation by baseline characteristics is expected to reduce the risk of 
important baseline differences between treatment groups and is considered appropriate. There are no

concerns regarding blinding. Assessment of this dossier did not raise concerns regarding GCP 
compliance. 
•  Results 
Baseline Characteristics 
Key demographic and baseline characteristics were generally balanced across all randomised 
treatment groups. Just over half (52.5%) of the patients were male.  
Based on eGFR values at baseline, calculated using the MDRD formula, most of the patients had either 
normal renal function (42.4%) or mild renal impairment (49.6%). The remaining 8.0% of patients 
had moderate renal impairment.  
Effects on HbA1c 
Both in the pooled analyses and in the separate pivotal clinical trials, the combination of empagliflozin 
and metformin was superior to placebo and metformin for both empagliflozin dosages. The results 
were highly statistically significant and robust in sensitivity analysis (Figure 2). The effects persisted 
over 76 weeks in the subjects who continued their participation (Figure 8).

patients taking metformin background medication in the pivotal trials and their extension 
trial (EFF-C1) - FAS (OC) 
Similar results were obtained for various background medications, including insulin (assessed over 18 
weeks, Figure 2). The precise treatment effect with insulin is somewhat difficult to estimate, because 
dose adaptations of insulin were allowed during part of the trial, and this resulted in a decrease of the 
insulin dose in the empagliflozin group by 7-14 U over 52 weeks. 
More subjects treated with empagliflozin reached the pre-specified target of HbA1c < 7.0% after 
24 weeks (EFF-C1: Placebo 20%. empa 10 mg 30%, empa 25 mg 35%). This analysis considered 
non-responders as failure, which causes a slight bias towards empagliflozin, as more placebo patients 
dropped out. 
Effects on fasting plasma glucose 
In general the changes in FPG were consistent with the changes in HbA1c. Treatment with 
empagliflozin+metformin provided clinically meaningful reductions in FPG compared with 
placebo+metformin. The treatment advantage was 27-29 mg/dL (10 and 25 mg empa respectively; 
~1.6 mmol/L) in EFF-C1 after 24 weeks. 
Effects on body weight 
The increased urinary glucose excretion associated with empagliflozin contributes to weight reduction. 
This is important as other classes of antidiabetic drugs, especially insulin and sulphonylureas, are 
often associated with weight gain.  
The change from baseline in body weight at 24 weeks was a key secondary endpoint in all pivotal trials. 
For the patients from the pivotal trials, treatment with empagliflozin+metformin provided body 
weight reductions after 24 weeks of treatment compared with placebo+metformin, in EFF-C1 the 
mean treatment advantage was 1.77 kg (empa 10 mg) or 2.00 kg (empa 25 mg). The reductions in 
body weight were maintained over the entire 76-week duration of the pivotal trials with their 
extensions.  
Effects on blood pressure 
In the patients from the pivotal trials who were taking metformin background, 
empagliflozin+metformin reductions in systolic blood pressure (EFF-C1: empa 10 mg: 3.6 mmHg 
empa 25 mg: 3.7 mmHg) after 24 weeks compared with placebo+metformin. This effect was 
maintained over the 76-week period of the pivotal trials combined with their extensions.

Clinical studies in special populations 
Figure 4 shows an overview of the subgroup analyses in EFF-C1. Efficacy in the groups ≥75 years, 
black or African American and Hispanic/Latino seems less than average, however these observations 
are not completely consistent between doses and accompanied by large confidence intervals (due to 
limited numbers of subjects). 
The proposed SmPC recommends that, in patients 75 years and older, an increased risk for volume 
depletion should be taken into account (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Due to the limited therapeutic 
experience with empagliflozin in patients aged 85 years and older, initiation of therapy in this 
population is not recommended. The observed reduction in efficacy may be related to worsening renal 
function with age.

Supportive study 
The active controlled trial 1245.28 compared empagliflozin 25 mg with glimepiride (on a background 
of metformin) and provides key evidence of the efficacy of the combination of empagliflozin and 
metformin over 104 weeks. The MMRM analysis, based on the FAS (OC) is presented in Figure 5 and 
demonstrates sustained efficacy of empa 25 mg+met over time.

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Empagliflozin is an orally administered, selective inhibitor of the sodium-dependent glucose 
co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) in the kidney, intended for use in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) with or without insulin background medication. It is proposed in a fixed dose combination 
(FDC) with metformin, which is the first line compound in current treatment guidelines for T2DM. The 
proposed dose strength are 5/850, 5/1000, 12.5/850 and 12.5/1000. The FDC is to be taken twice 
daily. 
The pivotal data on the efficacy of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes were based on four 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III trials of empagliflozin (10 mg or 25 mg, 
once-daily), each with a treatment duration of 24 weeks. One of these trials (1245.20) was 
conducted in treatment-naïve patients. Each of the other three pivotal trials included patients taking 
metformin background medication. In trial 1245.23(met), all patients had a background medication 
of metformin only. In trial 1245.23(met+SU), all patients were taking metformin and a 
sulphonylurea as background medication. Trial 1245.19 was a pioglitazone background study (with 
or without metformin); the majority of patients (75.5%) in this trial were taking metformin. The 
analysis in support of the proposed FDC is based on subjects in the latter 3 trials who were using at 
least metformin background medication. These data were pooled in EFF-C1. 
Empagliflozin was also investigated in other phase IIb and phase III placebo-controlled trials, most 
notably in patients treated with basal insulin (1245.33) or multiple daily injections of insulin 
(1245.49). Data from subjects using also metformin in these trials were pooled in EFF-C2 and 
support the efficacy of the proposed FDC in subjects with insulin background therapy. 
In these trials, empagliflozin and metformin were dosed as separate tablets and empagliflozin was 
administered once daily. In order to bridge these data to the proposed FDC, the applicant executed a 
Assessment report  
EMA/238334/2015 
Page 76/99 
  
  
 
pharmacokinetic bioequivalence study. Moreover, in trial 1276.10 non-inferiority of twice daily 
dosing versus once daily dosing of empagliflozin was investigated. 
Dose finding 
In the dose findings studies, the 25 mg dose of empagliflozin provided better efficacy than the 10 mg 
dose. The 50 mg dose was only investigated in study 1245.10. In this study, there was no additional 
benefit of the 50 mg dose in terms of efficacy. The selection of the 10 mg and 25 mg dose for the 
phase III studies was reasonable. In each of the pivotal phase III trials except for 1245.23 (met+SU) 
the reduction in HbA1c from baseline at 24 weeks was greater for empagliflozin 25 mg than for 
empagliflozin 10 mg. The pooled data of the pivotal trials (EFF-C1) showed that the adjusted mean 
change from baseline in HbA1c after 24 weeks of treatment was -0.58% for empagliflozin 10 mg 
and -0.62% for empagliflozin 25 mg. Although the 25 mg performed slightly better, the lower dose 
also showed clinically significant changes in HbA1c. In patients insufficiently treated with metformin 
alone, empagliflozin can be added. It is recommended to start treatment with the lower dose and then 
increase the dose if possible.  
In trial 1276.10 non-inferiority of twice daily dosing versus once daily dosing of empagliflozin was 
shown. The estimate of the difference between treatments suggest that twice daily dosing is slightly 
more effective than once daily dosing: -0.11% (-0.26%; 0.03%) for 25 mg and -0.02% (-0.16%; 
0.13%) for 10 mg per day. The upper bound for the confidence interval was below the predefined 
non-inferiority margin of 0.35%. If the hypothesis had been equivalence, then this would have been 
shown also, even with a tighter margin of 0.30% on both sides. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
All trials were large, double blind and placebo-controlled with a main trial period of 24 weeks. The 
main inclusion and exclusion criteria were harmonised across the trials. Men and women diagnosed 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus and with insufficient glycaemic control (HbA1c ≥7.0%). The trials 
differed mainly in background medication. The primary endpoint was HbA1c change from baseline as 
expected. 
In subjects with insulin background treatment, the main evaluation took place at 18 weeks. In the 
first 18 weeks, changing the insulin dose was discouraged, after that dose adaptations were allowed 
(resulting in reduced insulin use in the empa groups). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Treatment with empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg once daily resulted in improvement of glycaemic 
control with modest reductions of HbA1c and FPG. The pivotal trials demonstrated the superiority of 
both doses of empagliflozin to placebo after 24 weeks. 
Compared to placebo, empagliflozin as add on to metformin was associated with a clinically relevant 
reduction in HbA1c of -0.58% (10 mg) and -0.62% (25 mg). This result was consistent independent 
of background therapy besides metformin as tested in the various trials (none, sulphonylurea or 
pioglitazon). The effect was also robust in the sensitivity analysis using observed cases instead of 
“Last observation carried forward” as in the main analysis.  
The effect on fasting plasma glucose analysed as secondary endpoint further confirmed the primary 
analysis; the treatment advantage was 1.6 mmol/L for both strengths of empagliflozin. Other 
secondary endpoints showed reduction of body weight (empa 10: 1.77 kg; empa 25: 2.00 kg) and 
systolic blood pressure (empa 10: 3.6 mmHg; empa 25: 3.7 mmHg). 
Assessment report  
EMA/238334/2015 
Page 77/99 
  
  
Efficacy seemed almost the same when used in combination with insulin and metformin and evaluated 
after 18 weeks (empa 10 mg: -0.50%, empa 25 mg: -0.57%). 
Analyses are shown that efficacy is maintained over a period of 78 weeks that was observed in 
extension trials and 104 weeks in 1245.28. In the trials using basal insulin background, the treatment 
effect at 78 weeks was further reduced: insulin/met/empa 10: -0.36%; insulin/met/empa 10: 
-0.66%. After 52 weeks in patients using multiple injections of insulin, these numbers were: 
insulin/met/empa 10: -0.39% and: insulin/met/empa 25: -0.50%. However, these numbers were 
obtained with a reduction of insulin use by 5.44, 4.33, 6.88, and 14.10 IU per day respectively, 
making interpretation difficult. 
Subgroup analyses of the pivotal trials suggested that the treatment effect of empagliflozin in patients 
older than 75 years is reduced (25 mg: -0.25%) or absent (10 mg: +0.08%). This is related to 
reduced renal function in these subjects. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of treatment with empagliflozin/metformin combination therapy was robustly assessed 
by the clinical trial program and can be estimated as -0.6% HbA1c after 24 weeks. In clinical trials two 
doses were used: 10 mg and 25 mg. In general, the 25 mg dose performed slightly better, but 10 mg 
is adequate as a starting dose.  The data are confirmed by a reduction in fasting plasma glucose. 
Other relevant benefits include weight reduction and reduction of systolic blood pressure. In subjects 
also using insulin, the total dose of insulin was reduced. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
For the analysis of safety, data from 20 clinical studies included in this application were arranged into 
5 safety groupings (SAF-C1 to SAF-C5). A schematic representation of the groupings is provided in 
figure 6. Only patients taking metformin (with or without other antidiabetic medications) as 
background medication were included in the safety groupings. The safety groupings are: 
•  SAF-C1 (placebo-controlled studies, metformin only background): used for the safety assessment 
of empagliflozin in combination with background medication of metformin alone 
•  SAF-C2 (all placebo-controlled studies): used for the safety assessment of empagliflozin in 
combination with background metformin, with or without additional background antidiabetic 
medications. As the largest pool of placebo-controlled studies, SAF-C2 is the main pool for safety 
subgroup analyses 
•  SAF-C3 (all studies): includes studies without placebo control. As the largest pool of patients, it is 
mainly used for the identification of infrequent events 
•  SAF-C4 (16- to 24-week placebo-controlled studies): mainly used for drug side-effect labelling 
•  SAF-C5 (phase I studies): healthy subjects only

Adverse events 
Adverse event (AE) analysis was based on treatment-emergent AEs, with the focus on 
placebo-controlled studies (SAF-C2), which is reasonable. 
Most frequent AEs 
Genital infections stand out as being reported more frequently in the empa+met groups than in the 
placebo+met group (empa 5.5-5.8%, placebo 1.4%)(Table 20). A large similarity is noted between 
the data for empa 10 and empa 25, which supports the quality of the data.  
AEs of special interest 
Based on scientific considerations and regulatory concerns for SGLT-2 inhibitors, predefined searches 
were executed for adverse events of special interest (Table 20).

Decreased renal function 
Consistent with other SGLT-2 inhibitors, start of therapy was associated with a decline of mean eGFR. 
Subsequently, mean eGFR gradually increased to values that were slightly above baseline levels after 
80 weeks in subjects still on study. Between baseline and the end of treatment, small changes in eGFR 
values occurred, which seem age-dependant (Table 22).

For SAF-C3 (all studies), the overall proportion of patients with decreased renal function events was 
higher in the empa+met groups (0.6% for 10 mg; 0.8% for 25 mg) than in the placebo+met group 
(0.3%) and the all comparators+met group (0.4%).  
There were 579 patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2) at 
baseline in SAF-C3, in whom decreased renal function (SMQ) events were reported in 6.4%, 3.7%, 
and 1.6% of patients for empa 10 mg+met, empa 25 mg+met, and placebo+met, respectively. The 
imbalance of decreased renal function (SMQ) events in the empa+met groups compared with the 
comparator+met groups was in part explained by these patients (eGFR < 60: empa: 4.6%, 
comparator 1.9%). 
In the population with eGFR≥60) still more events occurred with empa vs comparator (eGFR ≥60: 
empa: 19 (0.4%), comparator: 5 (0.2%)). Few patients were reported with decreased renal function 
events (SMQ) that were serious (5 patients, 0.1% for all empa+met; 1 patient, <0.1% for all 
comparators+met) or that led to the discontinuation of study medication (5 patients, 0.1% for all 
empa+met; 1 patient, <0.1% for all comparators+met). The applicant attributes this to the transient 
decrease in eGFR values and other “plausible explanations”, discussing intercurrent diseases for 3 
serious events in the empa group: serious pneumonia, urinary tract infection and diarrhoea with 
dehydration and fatal liver cirrhosis with hepato-renal syndrome.  
Hepatic injury 
Although the overall frequencies were very low, a numerically higher proportion of patients in the 
empa+met groups were reported with ALT/AST ≥5x and <20x ULN (0.2%, 10 of 4961 patients) than 
in the all comparators+met group (<0.1%, 1 of 2312 patients). There was no case on treatment that 
was consistent with biochemical Hy’s law (ALT/AST ≥3x ULN with total bilirubin ≥2x ULN and alkaline 
phosphatase <2x ULN).

These and other cases were sent for adjudication to an expert panel of hepatologists. The adjudication 
results are presented in Table 23. Half of the 16 cases with empa were classified as possible or

Urinary tract infection is a labelled side-effect of empagliflozin. However, in the current integrated 
safety analyses, there was no evidence showing that treatment with empagliflozin combined with 
metformin increased the risk of urinary tract infection, either in the overall safety groupings or in 
specific subgroups (e.g. by age or by gender). In SAF-C2, affected patients were 139 (9.9%), 157 
(9.4%) and 159 (9.1%) for placebo, empa10 and empa25 respectively. 
Genital infection 
Across all safety groupings, the frequencies of patients with genital infection (BIcMQ) were 4- to 
5-fold higher in the empa+met groups (5.7%) than in the placebo+met group (1.4%) Female gender 
and a history of chronic or recurrent genital infections were independent risk factors for these 
infections. Severe or serious genital infections (both ≤0.1%) and premature discontinuations of study 
medication due to genital infection (≤0.6%) were very infrequent. 
Hypoglycaemia 
Treatment with empagliflozin and metformin did not increase the risk of hypoglycaemia, except when 
concomitantly used with a sulphonylurea. Hypoglycaemias were also more frequent with insulin 
background medication compared to non-insulin background medication, but this effect was similar in 
both treatment groups.  
Bone fractures 
There is no evidence that the combination of empagliflozin and metformin leads to an increase in the 
risk of bone fracture, based on analysis of adverse events and laboratory parameters. 
Volume depletion 
The overall frequencies of patients with volume depletion (BIcMQ) were low (<2%). The frequencies 
were numerically higher in the empa+met groups than in the placebo+met group (Table 20). Syncope 
and hypotension were the most frequently reported preferred terms in the volume depletion BIcMQ. 
Malignancy 
In SAF-3 (i.e. all studies), the frequencies of patients with malignancy (BIcMQ) were low (<2%) and 
were comparable across treatment groups. The numbers are too low to allow further analysis.

Serious adverse events and deaths 
In general, the frequencies of patients reported with serious adverse events (including fatal events) 
were lower in the empa+met groups than in the placebo+met group in all safety groupings. No group 
remarkably disfavours empa/met. Death occurred in 21 patients in the program, with similar rates of 
0.3% in the all empa+met and all comparators+met group. These findings raise no new concerns. 
Laboratory findings 
For most safety laboratory parameters, there were no clear trends that were considered clinically 
meaningful.  
There were small increases in haematocrit levels (of approximately 3%) from baseline to last value 
on treatment in the empa+met groups but not in the placebo+met group. Similarly, there were small 
increases (<5 mg/dL for any parameter) in the empa+met groups at Week 52 in total cholesterol, 
HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and non-HDL cholesterol. The changes were small, and there was 
no change in LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio. In the patients treated with empa+met, there was a decrease 
in triglycerides (-12 mg/dL for empa 10 mg+met and -3 mg/dL for empa 25 mg+met) compared with 
placebo+met.  
In all safety groupings, there were decreases in uric acid values (of approximately -0.7 mg/dL) in the 
empa+met groups from baseline to the end of treatment. There was no overall change in the 
placebo+met group.  
Consistent with the results of the analyses of efficacy, the safety analysis showed that in the 
empagliflozin+metformin groups there were decreases from baseline in systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure, with no overall change in the placebo+met group. Despite the reduction in blood 
pressure in the empagliflozin+metformin groups, the frequency of patients with hypotension or 
orthostatic hypotension was low and comparable in all treatment groups.  
Safety in special populations 
No efficacy/safety trials were executed in special populations. This section reports about subgroup 
analyses of the main trials. 
Although AE patterns differ with baseline characteristics, this effect is mostly similar for the various 
treatment groups. 
The subgroup analysis of AEs by age (Table 24) does not specifically address subjects aged 85 years 
or more (as requested by the assessment report template). This is acceptable, as in the proposed 
SmPC treatment initiation in these patients is “not recommended” based on limited experience. The 
numbers of patients with AEs older than 65 years are still small, and caution is required when 
evaluating these numbers. “Decreased renal function” and “Volume depletion” may be more frequent 
with older patients.

No new information is provided in this dossier compared to the evaluation of the monocomponents.  
Discontinuation due to AES 
Treatment with empa/met is usually well tolerated. More subjects prematurely discontinued placebo 
treatment. AEs leading to premature discontinuation in the empa groups were mostly associated with 
genital infections. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Trial data were pooled to adequately analyse the different aspects of the safety profile of empagliflozin 
in combination with background metformin, with or without additional background antidiabetic 
medications. The most relevant safety pooling for the benefit-risk assessment of empagliflozin is 
SAF-C2 as this pooling corresponds to the placebo-controlled trials with extensions in which 
metformin was used by all patients (4821 patients in total).  
The overall exposure to empagliflozin (10 or 25 mg) was 5519 patient years (median treatment 
duration 365 days) in SAF-C3 and is acceptable. 
Adverse Events 
Genital infections stand out as being reported more frequently in the empa+met groups than in the 
placebo+met group (empa 5.5-5.8%, placebo 1.4%). Also decreased renal function and volume 
depletion were reported more frequently during use of empagliflozin. These AEs were also predefined 
as AE of special interest, which are discussed below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/238334/2015 
Page 86/99 
  
  
Decreased renal function 
The overall proportion of patients with decreased renal function events was higher in the empa+met 
groups (0.6% for 10 mg; 0.8% for 25 mg) than in the placebo+met group (0.3%) and the all 
comparators+met group (0.4%). This effect was more pronounced in subjects with 
eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2. Although some patients are shown to have intermittent, acute illnesses, 
an aggravation of renal insufficiency by empa+met cannot be excluded. Moreover, the risk of 
metformin therapy increases with declining renal function, so small or temporary and reversible 
changes may still be clinically relevant. 
The analysis of patients with serum creatinine ≥2x baseline and above the ULN showed no differences 
between treatment groups. However, this analysis may not be sensitive to the changes that actually 
occur. 
With regard to renal function, both favourable and unfavourable observations are made. More renal 
AEs occurred with empa+met compared to placebo+met, both in subjects with eGFR >60 and even 
more in subjects with eGFR <60. The overall patterns observed for the changes in eGFR (i.e. an initial 
decrease followed by a sustained gradual increase) and in the decrease in albuminuria in patients 
treated with empagliflozin combined with metformin were consistent with those observed for the 
other drugs of the SGLT-2 inhibitor class. A trial in patients with type 1 diabetes showed that 
short-term treatment with empagliflozin attenuated renal hyperfiltration, which, along with the 
decrease in blood pressure and uric acid, provide a theoretical basis for kidney protection beyond 
blood glucose lowering for SGLT-2 inhibitors. 
Renal impairment is an “Important potential risk” in the RMP. 
Hepatic injury 
A higher proportion of patients in the empa+met groups were reported with ALT/AST ≥5x and <20x 
ULN (0.2%, 10 of 4961 patients) than in the all comparators+met group (<0.1%, 1 of 2312 patients). 
There was no case on treatment that was consistent with biochemical Hy’s law (ALT/AST ≥3x ULN 
with total bilirubin ≥2x ULN and alkaline phosphatase <2x ULN). 
All cases suspected of hepatic injury (including the above) were sent for blinded adjudication by a 
panel of independent hepatologists. There were 5 such cases in the comparator groups, all classified 
as “indeterminate” or “unlikely”. However, there were 16 cases in the empagliflozin groups, of which 
8 were classified as “indeterminate” or “unlikely”, 4 as “possible” and 4 as “probable”. 
During the registration process of Jardiance (empagliflozin), it became already clear (largely based on 
the same data) that the number of patients with serious hepatic adverse events is remarkably higher 
in the empagliflozin groups compared to placebo and comparators. 22 patients were reported with 
serious liver enzyme elevation (ALT/AST >=3x ULN with total bilirubin >=2x ULN or ALT/AST >=10x 
ULN) during or after treatment. Of these 22 patients 19 were reported during or after treatment with 
empagliflozin, whereas no cases were reported during treatment with placebo and only 2 cases were 
reported after treatment with placebo. One case was reported during treatment with glimepiride. In 
all but one of these cases the independent committee of hepatic experts judged that the causal 
relationship with the treatment was not probable. The occurrence of serious liver enzyme elevations 
was low and there were no imbalances unfavourable for empagliflozin in less severe signs of liver 
impairment (ALT and/or AST ≥3x ULN or total bilirubin ≥2x ULN). There was, however, a slight 
imbalance for elevations of ALT and/or AST ≥ 5x ULN (0.1% for placebo and 0.2% for both empa 10 
and 25 mg). A higher frequency was seen for ALT and/or AST ≥ 10x ULN and ≥ 20x ULN. 
The frequency of patients with elevated liver enzymes during the treatment period was not 
importantly influenced by history of liver or pancreatic disease at baseline or not. This means that the 
Assessment report  
EMA/238334/2015 
Page 87/99 
  
  
risk of liver injury cannot be diminished by limiting the use of empagliflozin to individuals without a 
history of liver or pancreatic disease. 
A risk for adverse liver events in patients cannot be excluded. Liver injury is identified as an 
“Important potential risk” in the RMP. The use of the product is contraindicated in section 4.3 of the 
SmPC and a warning is present in section 4.4 (Cases of hepatic injury have been reported with 
empagliflozin in clinical trials. A causal relationship between empagliflozin and hepatic injury has not 
been established.) 
Urinary tract infection 
Urinary tract infection is a labelled side-effect of empagliflozin. However, in these data treatment with 
empagliflozin combined with metformin did not increase the risk of urinary tract infection, either in the 
overall safety groupings or in specific subgroups (e.g. by age or by gender). In SAF-C2, affected 
patients were 139 (9.9%), 157 (9.4%) and 159 (9.1%) for placebo, empa10 and empa25 
respectively. 
In the absence of an SMQ for urinary tract infections, a wide list of MedDRA preferred terms was 
identified for a conservative assessment of adverse events related to or being a potential result of a 
urinary tract infection. There was low specificity for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection for some of 
the preferred terms in the search, such as “bacteriuria” and “asymptomatic bacteriuria”. However, 
this low specificity did not seem to abscure an effect. 
Urinary tract infections are addressed in section 4.4 of the SmPC and an important identified risk in 
the RMP. 
Genital infection 
Across all safety groupings, the frequencies of patients with genital infection (BIcMQ) higher in the 
empa+met groups (5.7%) than in the placebo+met group (1.4%). Female gender and a history of 
chronic or recurrent genital infections were independent risk factors for these infections. 
Severe or serious genital infections (both ≤0.1%) and premature discontinuations of study 
medication due to genital infection (≤0.6%) were infrequent. Therefore, although treatment with the 
combination of empagliflozin and metformin increased the risk of genital infections, the events 
appeared to be manageable. 
Genital infection is an important identified risk in the RMP. 
Hypoglycaemia 
Treatment with empagliflozin and metformin only increased the risk of hypoglycaemia, when 
concomitantly used with a sulphonylurea. Hypoglycaemias were also more frequent with insulin 
background medication compared to non-insulin background medication, but this effect was similar in 
both treatment groups. Less precise dosing of SU compared to insulin and the fact that SU users often 
do not monitor their own blood glucose levels (contrary to insulin users) may contribute to this 
difference. 
Hypoglycaemia with insulin and/or sulphonylurea is an important identified risk in the RMP. 
Bone fractures 
The combination of empagliflozin and metformin did not increase the risk of bone fracture, based on 
analysis of adverse events and laboratory parameters. 
Assessment report  
EMA/238334/2015 
Page 88/99 
  
  
Bone fracture is an important potential risk in the RMP. 
Volume depletion 
The overall frequencies of patients with volume depletion (BIcMQ) were low (<2%), but higher in the 
empa+met groups than in the placebo+met group. Syncope and hypotension were the most 
frequently reported preferred terms in the volume depletion BIcMQ. 
Use in patients at risk of volume depletion is addressed in section 4.4 of the SmPC and an important 
identified risk in the RMP. 
Malignancy 
In SAF-3 (i.e. all studies), the frequencies of patients with malignancy (BIcMQ) were low (<2%) and 
were comparable across treatment groups. The numbers are too low to allow further analysis. 
Serious events 
In general, the frequencies of patients reported with serious adverse events (including fatal events) 
were lower in the empa+met groups than in the placebo+met group in all safety groupings. No group 
specifically disfavours empa/met.  
Death 
Death occurred in 21 patients in the program, with similar rates of 0.3% in the all empa+met and all 
comparators+met group. These findings raise no concerns. 
Discontinuation due to AEs 
Treatment with empa/met is usually well tolerated. More subjects prematurely discontinued placebo 
treatment. AEs leading to premature discontinuation in the empa groups, were mostly associated with 
genital infections. 
Labelling in the SmPC 
The applicant has based the proposal for Section 4.8 of the SmPC on SAF-C4, consisting of 16- to 
24-week placebo-controlled studies; this is a subset of SAF-C2 that was used for the above analysis 
(see figure 11). The numbers in SAF-C4 are similar, but not the same as in SAF-C2. For brevity, no 
tables for SAF-C4 are included here. 
The Applicant’s algorithm for identifying side-effects was considered rather restrictive as it required a 
frequency of ≥2% in the empagliflozin+metformin group (10 mg or 25 mg) and a 2-fold higher 
frequency than in the placebo+metformin group. During the procedure, the applicant provided 
additional analyses showing that no adverse events would be additionally included when analysing 
Adverse events in SAF-C4 with a frequency of ≥ 1% more in the empagliflozin+metformin group  
(10 mg or 25 mg) than in the placebo+metformin group. 
Special populations 
No efficacy/safety trials were executed in special populations. Instead, subgroup analyses of the main 
trials are presented. Although AE patterns differ with baseline characteristics, this effect is mostly 
similar for the various treatment groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/238334/2015 
Page 89/99 
  
  
The numbers of patients with AEs older than 65 years are small, and caution is required when 
evaluating these numbers. “Decreased renal function” and “Volume depletion” may be more frequent 
with older patients (≥ 65 years). 
Laboratory evaluations 
For most safety laboratory parameters, there were no clear trends that were considered clinically 
meaningful.  
There were small increases in haematocrit levels (of approximately 3%) and cholesterol. These 
changes can possibly be explained by haemoconcentration. 
There were decreases in uric acid values (of approximately -0.7 mg/dL) with empa+met compared 
to placebo+met . This change could be non-adverse as lower uric acid levels may be associated with 
lower cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. 
Consistent with the results of the analyses of efficacy, the safety analysis showed that there were 
decreases from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure for empa+met but not 
placebo_met. This was not associated with events of (orthostatic) hypotension. Therefore, these 
changes are favourable rather than adverse. Also, there were almost no changes in pulse rate from 
baseline to the end of treatment. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In general, tolerability of empagliflozin/metformin combination therapy was acceptable and the 
safety profile in line with what is expected from the combined use of empagliflozin and metformin. 
Genital infections are the most common AE of the FDC. Both pre-clinical and clinical findings suggest 
that combination of empagliflozin with metformin may increase toxicity, especially in relation to renal 
failure. “Decreased renal function” and “Volume depletion” may be more frequent with older patients. 
Uncertainty remains around hepatic injuries.

Synjardy contains a new active substance (empagliflozin) which, on the 1st of January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the Union; the product information of Synjardy will 
therefore have the black triangle and the related standard statements and the product will be 
subsequently included on the additional monitoring list. 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Synjardy (empagliflozin/metformin fixed dose combination: 5/850, 5/1000, 12.5/850 and 
12.5/1000 mg) is proposed in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to improve 
glycaemic control in patients inadequately controlled with metformin, with or without other 
glucose-lowering medicinal products, including insulin. Empagliflozin is an orally administered, 
selective inhibitor of the sodium-dependent glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) in the kidney, already 
authorised as Jardiance, also for use in combination with metformin. 
Benefits  
Beneficial effects 
This application is based on an evaluation of the efficacy and safety of the combination of 
empagliflozin and metformin compared with the combination of placebo and metformin. Data from a 
total of 20 clinical trials, comprising 5 phase I trials, 4 phase IIb trials, and 11 phase III trials, is 
included. The clinical programme included a representative spectrum of patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus. 
To support this application three bioequivalence studies were conducted under fed conditions (study 
1276.6 and 1276.7) or fed and fasted conditions (study 1276.8 , only with the highest strength). In 
these studies the FDC tablets were compared with a free dose combination of the individual tablets 
empagliflozin (5 mg and 12.5 mg) and metformin (500 mg, 850 mg, and 1000 mg). Bioequivalence 
between the FDC tablets and the free dose combinations has been shown for all combinations tested 
and under fed and fasted conditions. 
The empagliflozin/metformin FDC will be administered twice-daily due to the pharmacokinetic 
properties of metformin. The company conducted two studies to support twice daily dosing of 
empagliflozin in which the pharmacokinetics and safety and efficacy of twice daily administration of 5 
mg or 12.5 mg empagliflozin were compared with once daily 10 mg or 25 mg, respectively. A 
comparable extent of exposure over 24 hours and glucose lowering effect has been found for the 
different dosing regimens and the steady state plasma concentrations of empagliflozin remained 
stable after repeated dosing over a period of 16 weeks. 
From the trials, only those patients taking background metformin were included in the evaluation of 
efficacy. A pooled analysis of patients (n=1679) from 3 pivotal trials showed that the adjusted mean 
treatment difference to placebo+metformin for the change from baseline in HbA 1c after 24 weeks 
was -0.58% for empagliflozin 10 mg+metformin and -0.62% for empagliflozin 25 mg+metformin. 
Empagliflozin+metformin provided improvements in glycaemic control regardless of additional 
background therapy. This was demonstrated when empagliflozin+metformin was administered 
without additional background medication, in combination with a sulphonylurea, and in combination 
with pioglitazone. In addition, empagliflozin+metformin was efficacious in patients treated with 
background insulin (with a simultaneous reduction in insulin dose). For all trials and efficacy 
groupings studied, the results for HbA1c were confirmed by the sensitivity analysis of observed cases 
and analyses of proportion of patients attaining HbA1c of less than 7%. Efficacy was also robust in 
most subgroups that were analysed.

The posology bridging study 1276.10 showed comparable efficacy of twice-daily and once-daily 
empagliflozin when administered as add-on therapy to metformin.

The durability of efficacy was primarily based on data up to 104 weeks (for trial 1245.28) and showed 
a sustained treatment effect over time with regard to the HbA1c reduction from baseline; the 
extensions of the pivotal trials (1245.31) also showed durability of efficacy over 76 weeks.

The effect on fasting plasma glucose analysed as secondary endpoint further confirmed the primary 
analysis; the treatment advantage was 1.6 mmol/L for both strengths of empagliflozin. Other

secondary endpoints showed reduction of body weight (empa 10: 1.77 kg; empa 25: 2.00 kg) and 
systolic blood pressure (empa 10: 3.6 mmHg; empa 25: 3.7 mmHg)  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Subgroup analyses of the pivotal trials demonstrate that the treatment effect of empagliflozin in 
patients older than 75 years is reduced (25 mg: -0.25%, n=13) or absent (10 mg: +0.08%, n=15). 
This is related to reduced renal function in these subjects.  
Originally, no separate results were presented for subjects with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2, as 
metformin and the proposed FDC are contraindicated in these subjects. In the trials, 119 such 
patients were included, most (n=106) of them with 45 ≤ eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m2. In response to 
CHMP questions, results for these latter patients were presented: the placebo corrected treatment 
effect was -0.26% (10 mg) or -0.30% (25%). 
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
The safety assessment of empagliflozin combined with metformin was based on 7052 patients with 
ongoing metformin therapy (with or without other antidiabetic therapies) from 20 clinical studies. A 
total of 2847 patients were exposed to empagliflozin in combination with metformin for at least a year 
and 1929 were exposed for 76 weeks or longer. For analysis, the data were pooled. 
The frequencies of premature discontinuation of trial medication were higher in the placebo group 
than in the empagliflozin groups (EFF-C1: placebo: 21.8%; empagliflozin 10 mg: 13.8%; 
empagliflozin 25 mg: 16.0%).  
The overall frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events was comparable between treatment 
groups (SAF-C2: placebo: 72.8%; empagliflozin 10 mg: 66.4%; empagliflozin 25 mg: 66.3%). AEs 
leading to discontinuation were slightly more frequent with empa+met (SAF-C2: placebo: 4.0%; 
empagliflozin 10 mg: 4.3%; empagliflozin 25 mg: 4.4%). 
Across all safety groupings, the frequencies of patients with genital infection (BIcMQ) were 4- to 
5-fold higher in the empa+met groups (5.7%) than in the placebo+met group (1.4%). Female gender 
and a history of chronic or recurrent genital infections were independent risk factors for these 
infections. Severe or serious genital infections (both ≤0.1%) and premature discontinuations of study 
medication due to genital infection (≤0.6%) occurred but were infrequent. 
Consistent with other SGLT-2 inhibitors, therapy was associated with an initial decline of mean eGFR 
followed by recovery. The effect may be age-dependant. For SAF-C3 (all studies), the overall 
proportion of patients with decreased renal function events was higher in the empa+met groups 
(0.6% for 10 mg; 0.8% for 25 mg) than in the placebo+met group (0.3%) and the all 
comparators+met group (0.4%). This effect was more pronounced in subjects with 
eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2 (10 mg: 6.4%, 25 mg: 3.7%, placebo: 1.6%). 
Although the overall frequencies were very low, a higher proportion of patients in the empa+met 
groups were reported with ALT/AST ≥5x and <20x ULN (0.2%, 10 of 4961 patients) than in the all 
comparators+met group (<0.1%, 1 of 2312 patients). There was no case on treatment that was 
consistent with biochemical Hy’s law (ALT/AST ≥3x ULN with total bilirubin ≥2x ULN and alkaline 
phosphatase <2x ULN). All cases suspected of hepatic injury (including the above) were sent for 
blinded adjudication by a panel of independent hepatologists. There were 5 such cases in the 
comparator groups, all classified as “indeterminate” or “unlikely”. However, there were 16 cases in 
the empagliflozin groups, of which 8 were classified as “indeterminate” or “unlikely”, 4 as “possible” 
and 4 as “probable”.

Urinary tract infection is a labelled side-effect of empagliflozin. However, in these data treatment 
with empagliflozin combined with metformin did not increase the risk of urinary tract infection, either 
in the overall safety groupings or in specific subgroups (e.g. by age or by gender). In SAF-C2, affected 
patients were 139 (9.9%), 157 (9.4%) and 159 (9.1%) for placebo, empa10 and empa25 
respectively. 
Treatment with empagliflozin and metformin increased the risk of hypoglycaemia, only when 
concomitantly used with a sulphonylurea (empa: 17.1-19.6%; placebo 14.5%). Hypoglycaemias 
were also more frequent with insulin background medication compared to non-insulin background 
medication, but this effect was similar in both treatment groups.  
The combination of empagliflozin and metformin did not increase the risk of bone fracture, based on 
analysis of adverse events and laboratory parameters. 
The overall frequencies of patients with volume depletion were higher in the 
empagliflozin+metformin groups (1.0% for both empagliflozin doses compared with the 
placebo+metformin group (0.5%).  
In SAF-3 (i.e. all studies), the frequencies of patients with malignancy (BIcMQ) were low (<2%) and 
were comparable across treatment groups. The numbers are too low to allow further analysis. 
In general, the frequencies of patients reported with serious adverse events (including fatal events) 
were lower in the empa+met groups than in the placebo+met group in all safety groupings. No group 
remarkably disfavours empa/met. Death occurred in 21 patients in the program, with similar rates of 
0.3% in the all empa+met and all comparators+met group. 
Subgroup analyses of the main trials show that AE patterns differ with baseline characteristics, but 
this effect is mostly similar for the various treatment groups; thus, the safety profile is usually similar 
for the various subgroups. 
There were small increases in haematocrit levels (of approximately 3%) and all fractions of 
cholesterol during active treatment. Also, there were decreases in uric acid values in these patients. 
As mentioned under efficacy, there were decreases from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure, without excess events of (orthostatic) hypotension. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The numbers of patients with AEs older than 65 years are small, and caution is required when 
evaluating these numbers. “Decreased renal function” and “Volume depletion” may be more frequent 
with older patients. 
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The efficacy of treatment with empagliflozin/metformin combination therapy is robustly assessed by 
the clinical trial program and can be estimated as -0.6% HbA1c after 24 weeks, with a slight 
advantage for the higher dose. The data are confirmed by a reduction in fasting plasma glucose. The 
improvement in glycaemic control was significant and clinically meaningful, and was achieved without 
an increased incidence of hypoglycaemia. Other relevant benefits include weight reduction and 
reduction of systolic blood pressure. In subjects also using insulin, the total dose of insulin may be 
reduced, which might be beneficial. 
The observed effects of empagliflozin on HbA1c, body weight and blood pressure could be beneficial 
for patients as they may translate into reductions in macrovascular and microvascular disease in the 
long term. There were small increases in cholesterol with empagliflozin, of which the resulting 
long-term effects have not been investigated. The results of a CV outcome study are awaited.

The proposed FDC is usually well tolerated, resulting in high retention rates in the clinical trials. In 
general, the safety profile of empagliflozin is that of a SGLT-2 inhibitor. Overall, no major differences 
were observed between the 10 and 25 mg dose, but number of AEs may be higher for the higher dose 
in some high risk patients, like patients ≥75 years. There was an increased risk of genital infections 
in patients using empagliflozin. Genital infections were usually not serious, but can be very 
uncomfortable. 
With regard to renal function, both favourable and unfavourable observations are made. More renal 
AEs occurred with empa+met compared to placebo+met, both in subjects with eGFR >60 and even 
more in subjects with eGFR <60. The overall patterns observed for the changes in eGFR (i.e. an initial 
decrease followed by a sustained gradual increase) and in the decrease in albuminuria in patients 
treated with empagliflozin combined with metformin were consistent with those observed for the 
other drugs of the SGLT-2 inhibitor class. A trial in patients with type 1 diabetes showed that 
short-term treatment with empagliflozin attenuated renal hyperfiltration, which, along with the 
decrease in blood pressure and uric acid, provide a theoretical basis for kidney protection beyond 
blood glucose lowering for SGLT-2 inhibitors. 
During the registration process of Jardiance (empagliflozin), similar concerns regarding hepatic 
injury were raised and it was premature to conclude that there would be no risk for adverse liver 
events in patients. However, the current data seem less reassuring than during the monotherapy 
assessment. This risk is important; therefore, hepatic injury is included as an important potential risk 
in the updated RMP. 
In elderly patients (above 75 years) efficacy may be less by reduced renal function, while the risks 
of volume depletion and decreased renal function may be increased compared to younger patients. 
Thus, care should be taken as recommended in the SmPC. 
With empagliflozin there was a low risk of hypoglycaemia, except in patients using empagliflozin in 
combination with MET+SU. In these patients empagliflozin should be used with caution. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The overall B/R of Synjardy is positive.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
Empagliflozin in combination with metformin overall has a B/R profile expected of both components; 
some additional issues were identified:  
The number of patients with decreased renal function events was higher in the empa+met groups, 
compared to the monotherapy both within the target population (eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73m2) and, in 
particular, with more advanced renal impairment. These latter patients are contra-indicated to the 
FDC due to the metformin, however patients who are already on treatment with the FDC may 
sometimes be still on treatment when eGFR drops below 60 mL/min/1.73m2. Efficacy may decrease 
and safety issues increase when the combination of metformin and empagliflozin is given in patients 
with reduced renal function. This may also concern patients > 75 years of age, who have reduced or 
even absent additional benefit when treated with the FDC. 
The Applicant’s algorithm for identifying side-effects to describe in the SmPC was considered rather 
restrictive as it required a frequency of ≥2% in the empagliflozin+metformin group. However, an 
assessment of the events with a more sensitive excess of only ≥1% showed no different pattern.

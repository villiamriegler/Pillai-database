2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Tumour necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) 
Ilaris is indicated for the treatment of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated periodic syndrome 
(TRAPS). 
Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS)/mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD) 
Ilaris is indicated for the treatment of hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS)/mevalonate kinase deficiency 
(MKD). 
Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) 
Ilaris is indicated for the treatment of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). Ilaris should be given in combination 
with colchicine, if appropriate. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
The three rare diseases TRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF are a group of clinically distinct autoinflammatory 
conditions, which, together with CAPS, have been classified under a single term of periodic fever syndromes. 
FMF is the most frequent periodic febrile syndrome among the autoinflammatory syndromes. It is estimated that 
about 100,000 subjects worldwide are affected by FMF (Fonnesu et al 2009). FMF is prevalent mainly among 
eastern Mediterranean people: non-Ashkenazi Jews, Armenians, Turks, and Arabs, for whom the estimated 
prevalence is between 1/200-1/1000 (Fonnesu et al 2009). With a population of more than 67 million 
inhabitants, therefore, a large proportion of all the FMF cases in the world live in Turkey (Turkish FMF Study 
Group 2005). 
Hyperimmunoglobulin D/Mevalonate kinase deficiency (HIDS/MKD) is also a rare autoinflammatory disease, the 
epidemiology of which is largely unknown. A prospective active surveillance study was recently conducted in 
Germany during a period of 3 years, by the German Paediatric Surveillance Unit for rare paediatric diseases, 
yielding 16 cases from 10 families (Lainka et al 2012). Based on these patients, the prevalence of HIDS/MKD in 
children less than 16 years of age during the 3 years of observation was estimated at 6.2 (95% CI: 3.5, 10.2) 
per million in this age group (Lainka et al 2012). The international HIDS/MKD database collected data about 
patients with suspected and confirmed HIDS/MKD (van der Hilst et al 2008). Established in 1994 by Dutch 
researchers, this group had by Jan 2007 collected information (submitted online by the patients’ physicians) on 
244 patients out of whom a total of 126 patients with mutation-positive HIDS/MKD were identified (van der Hilst 
2008). 
Publications with available information on TRAPS epidemiology are extremely scarce. Clinical study groups, 
mostly from patients attending in- and out-patient rheumatology centers, are active at national and 
international level in Europe, and have published data to characterize the frequency, clinical signs, and 
genotypic features of the disease. A review paper reported a prevalence rate of 1 per million in the United 
Kingdom (Lachmann and Hawkins 2009).

2.1.3.  Biologic features 
The 3 rare diseases, FMF, HIDS/MKD, and TRAPS are a group of clinically distinct auto inflammatory conditions, 
which, together with CAPS, have been classified under a single term of periodic fever syndromes. 
Although the underlying genetic defects and molecular aetiology differ across the periodic fever syndromes, the 
disease mechanism common across these autoinflammatory conditions involves abnormal activation of the 
innate immune system, leading to dysregulation of cytokines and excessive inflammation (Ozen and Bilginer 
2014). 
The overlapping clinical manifestations across the periodic fever syndromes are the recurrent episodes of 
systemic inflammation accompanied by high and disabling fever and characteristic signs and symptoms in target 
organs and body systems (i.e., serositis, neutrophilic rash, muco-cutaneous ulcers, arthralgia/arthritis, and 
aseptic meningitis/headaches) (Piram et al 2011, ter Haar et al 2013). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
FMF is an autosomal recessive disease that affects mainly people of Mediterranean ancestry. Approximately 
90% of patients with FMF experience the onset of disease before the age of 20 years. FMF is characterized by 
short febrile attacks caused by neutrophil -induced serosal inflammation and a gradual accumulation of amyloid 
in the kidneys. These febrile attacks are associated with pain in the abdomen, chest, joints, muscles, scrotum, 
and/or skin (Sozeri and Kasapcopur 2015). 
HIDS/MKD is an autosomal recessive disorder which is characterized by febrile attacks that last 3 to 7 days 
occurring every 4 to 6 weeks. These attacks are often associated with abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, 
headache, polyarthralgia, non-destructive arthritis, and/or skin lesions (Hausmann and Dedeoglu 2013, van der 
Hilst et al 2005). HIDS, originally named based on the high serum levels of immunoglobulin D (IgD) in the first 
cases described, is caused by mutations in the gene encoding mevalonate kinase, a critical enzyme acting early 
in the isoprenoid pathway. Therefore, HIDS is also referred to as MKD (van der Meer et al 1984, Drenth et al 
1999, Stoffels and Simon 2011) and the two terms are often used interchangeably.  
TRAPS is an autosomal dominant disorder that affects mostly people of northern European descent. The median 
age of onset is 3 years. TRAPS is characterized by febrile attacks that tend to last longer than those of FMF or 
HIDS. These attacks are associated with abdominal pain, severe myalgia, and painful erythema on the trunk or 
extremities. An estimated 14% to 25% of TRAPS patients develop reactive amyloidosis (van der Hilst et al 
2005). Treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) or glucocorticoids can reduce the 
severity of symptoms but does not affect the frequency of febrile attacks (Hausmann and Dedeoglu 2013). 
The recurrent episodes of fever and severe localized inflammation are not explained by usual childhood 
infections. The episodes are usually associated with elevated serum levels of acute-phase reactants (e.g., 
Creactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA), fibrinogen), an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), 
and leukocytosis. Febrile episodes and associated symptoms in patients with these diseases can have a notable 
effect on quality of life (QoL), affecting school, work and interpersonal relationships (Hoffman and Simon 2009). 
Although the inflammatory attacks cause much morbidity and significantly decreases the QoL of patients, the 
major source of mortality and most serious complication in patients with FMF, HIDS/MKD or TRAPS is 
represented by progressive secondary amyloidosis that may develop over several years and can progress to 
chronic kidney disease with subsequent renal failure. Renal amyloidosis is observed in up to 60% of untreated 
FMF patients, up to 25% of TRAPS patients and in <10% of HIDS/MKD patients (van der Hilst et al 2005; 
Hoffman and Simon 2009).

2.1.5.  Management 
To date, there are no approved therapies for HIDS/MKD or TRAPS. Certain medications have been used to treat 
the symptoms of these periodic fever syndromes, but these provide limited control over the relapsing febrile 
attacks and none treat the underlying inflammation. It has been reported that acute treatment with NSAIDs or 
corticosteroids can reduce the symptoms associated with febrile attacks in some patients. Literature reports 
have suggested that both anakinra (a human IL-1 receptor antagonist) and eternacept (a TNF-α inhibitor) might 
be effective for the treatment of periodic fever syndromes. However, while anakinra may have a practical 
limitation due to the need for daily injections and etanercept may have some limited utility, both are not 
approved to treat these conditions. 
For patients with FMF, colchicine has shown to be effective in controlling febrile attacks and preventing 
secondary amyloidosis in the majority of these patients. However, colchicine is not universally approved for the 
treatment of FMF and is associated with the significant side effects of diarrhea and transient elevation of 
transaminases and the rare side effects of liver dysfunction, leukopenia, and neuromyopathy. Colchicine doses 
must be adjusted in patients with impaired renal or liver function, and other medications can affect the 
metabolism of colchicine. Patients who do not respond to or are intolerant to colchicine have very few, if any, 
treatment options. 
Thus, there is a unmet medical need for a therapy that provide both relief of fever and symptoms as well as 
effective disease control in patients with FMF in whom colchicine is contraindicated, is not tolerated, or does not 
provide an adequate response, HIDS/MKD, and TRAPS. 
About the product 
Canakinumab, a human IgG1 kappa antibody directed against IL-1β, is already authorized in the EU for the 
treatment of Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS) in adults and children (≥ 2 years), for systemic 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) in children (≥ 2 years) and for gouty arthritis in adults. IL-1β is a 
pro-inflammatory cytokine that is elaborated by a variety of cell types, particularly mononuclear phagocytes, in 
response to injury, infection and cellular activation. IL-1β is known to play a dominant role in the 
pathophysiology of a number of inflammatory diseases including the group of auto inflammatory conditions 
known as periodic fever syndromes. 
The claimed indications are: 
Tumour necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) 
Ilaris is indicated for the treatment of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated periodic syndrome 
(TRAPS). 
Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS)/mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD) 
Ilaris is indicated for the treatment of hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS)/mevalonate kinase deficiency 
(MKD). 
Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) 
Ilaris is indicated for the treatment of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) in patients in whom colchicine is 
contraindicated, is not tolerated, or does not provide an adequate response despite the highest tolerable dose of 
colchicine. 
The approved indications are:

Tumour necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) 
Ilaris is indicated for the treatment of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated periodic syndrome 
(TRAPS). 
Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS)/mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD) 
Ilaris is indicated for the treatment of hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS)/mevalonate kinase deficiency 
(MKD). 
Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) 
Ilaris is indicated for the treatment of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). Ilaris should be given in combination 
with colchicine, if appropriate. 
The recommended starting dose of Ilaris in TRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF patients is 150 mg for patients with body 
weight > 40 kg and 2 mg/kg for patients with body weight ≥ 7.5 kg and ≤ 40 kg. This is administered every four 
weeks as a single dose via subcutaneous injection 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The MAH applied for an extension of the indication for the treatment of Periodic Fever Syndromes. The present 
variation is grouped with a line extension to register a new pharmaceutical form i.e., 150 mg/ml solution for 
injection. 
The pivotal Study N2301 was still ongoing at the time of MA variation application submission (24-week 
randomized withdrawal phase has been finalised and 72-week open-label treatment phase has not yet been 
finalised). 
Consultation with PEI (CHMP Rapporteur) took place on 8 October 2015 and with Fimea (CHMP Co-Rapporteur) 
on 25 September 2015. In both of these pre-submission meetings, the content of the quality and clinical parts 
of dossier were discussed and agreed on. CHMP scientific advice of the quality and clinical issues was received 
on 25 July 2013. 
The proposed indications of TRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF for canakinumab are supported by Paediatric 
Investigation Plans (PIP) which all have been completed and received positive opinion on compliance check from 
the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) on 26 February 2016 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The current commercially available dosage forms of Ilaris are a lyophilised 150 mg powder for solution for 
injection and 150 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection. The present extension application is 
submitted to register canakinumab 150 mg/1 mL solution for injection in vial. The present and proposed dosage 
forms are for subcutaneous use. 
To support this, data for the solution for injection in vial is provided with the submission package including 
additional data for “solution for injection in prefilled syringe”. The solution for injection in prefilled syringe data 
is considered supportive only and the prefilled syringe presentation is not registered with this submission.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The entire Ilaris CTD 3.2.S Module related to the existing presentations (EU/1/09/564/001-003) remains 
unchanged. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
The currently approved Ilaris presentation is a lyophilisate which contains 150 mg of canakinumab in histidine 
buffer with sucrose and polysorbate 80 as additional excipients.  
The proposed liquid formulation in single-use vial contains 150 mg/mL canakinumab. Mannitol is used as 
stabiliser instead of sucrose, and the content of histidine and polysorbate 80 is lower (see Table 1). The 
suitability of the liquid formulation was demonstrated in formulation robustness studies. 
The nature and contents of the container consist of 1 mL of solution for injection in a vial (type I glass) with a 
(laminated chlorobutyl rubber) stopper and flip-off (aluminium) cap. The container closure system meets the 
Ph. Eur. requirements. The primary packaging of the liquid presentation is comparable to that of the 
lyophilisate; only the vial size is smaller. 
Packs contain one vial. Needles are not provided by the manufacturer. 
Process validation of the manufacture of canakinumab solution in vial was performed based on the production of 
consecutive validation batches at commercial manufacturing scale. The data provided indicate that the process 
is capable of consistently manufacturing a finished product which meets the specifications.The applicant has 
demonstrated the analytical comparability of the finished product for all presentations. 
The comparability of canakinumab solution in vial to the lyophilisate was thoroughly assessed in line with ICH 
Q5E. Canakinumab solution in vial and lyophilisate demonstrated comparable physico-chemical properties and 
potency after storage at the long term storage conditions (2 years, 2°C - 8°C). The excipients used for 
formulation of the finished product comply with the requirements of the Ph. Eur. None of the excipients used in 
the manufacture of the finished product are of human or animal origin. No novel excipients have been introduced 
in the manufacture of the finished product. 
Finished product release specifications were set based on release and stability data of canakinumab solution. 
Where appropriate, the acceptance criteria are identical to those for the lyophilisate. Additional tests are used to 
control purity of the canakinumab solution in vial and some acceptance criteria are more stringent than for 
control of the lyophilisate (purity by reducing SDS-PAGE, purity by SEC and charge heterogeneity by CEX). This 
is endorsed. The resulting specifications for release and stability testing for canakinumab solution in vial are 
considered acceptable. The applicant has appropriately justified the proposed limits in their response. The limits 
are supported by clinical studies and are identical to the limits of commercial Ilaris finished product. 
The test methods are described, with references to Ph. Eur where appropriate. Non-compendial methods were 
validated according to ICH Q2 with acceptable results.  
Batch analysis data have been provided for eight batches of canakinumab solution in vial (clinical, registration 
and process validation batches). The batch release results of the finished product lots are within the specification 
limits, consistent and highly similar indicating that the manufacturing process is under control. 
Stability studies for canakinumab solution in vial are conducted in line with ICH Q5C and Q1A. A photostability 
study has been performed according to ICH Q1B. 
A shelf life of 24 months at 2°C-8°C is proposed for canakinumab liquid in vial. To support the claim the applicant 
has provided stability results of the liquid in vial registration batches that are representative of commercial scale 
process and manufactured during October 2014 at Novartis Stein AG (Switzerland). Data of 12 months of 
ongoing stability studies is presented for long term conditions (5°C) including 6 months for accelerated (25°C) 
and stressed (30°C/40°C) conditions. In addition 24 months supportive data for a clinical liquid in vial batch is 
presented.

Furthermore, supportive stability data (36 months) for three PFS batches are provided for long-term, 
accelerated and stressed conditions. The batches were manufactured during 2010. The data from the PFS 
batches are considered supportive since the formulation of the solution in vial and in PFS is identical and 
comparability of canakinumab in the PFS and the vial presentation was shown. Importantly, a comparative 
stability profile was demonstrated. 
Overall the 24 month shelf life (2°C-8°C) is acceptable. 
In relation to adventitious agents, none of the excipients used for the solution formulation are of human or 
animal origin. Thus, viral and TSE safety is still sufficiently demonstrated. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
For the most part information on development and manufacture of the finished product is presented in a 
satisfactory manner and no major issues were identified during the assessment of the dossier. The few points for 
clarification raised during the review were satisfactorily addressed by the applicant. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
From a quality point of view the line extension is approvable when Ilaris is used in accordance with the SmPC and 
package leaflet. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Non new non-clinical studies have been performed.  
However additional pharmacology information and an update of the pharmacokinetic data for the specific 
periodic fever syndromes indications FMF, HIDS/MKD and TRAPS have been provided. This includes comparative 
systemic exposure ratios in nonclinical toxicology species marmoset and patients with periodic fever to confirm 
the adequacy of previous toxicology data to support the clinical use of canakinumab in the new indications.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
No new non-clinical pharmacology studies have been submitted for this application. 
Literature data has been provided regarding the role of IL-1β in the individual periodic fever syndromes. 
Periodic fever syndromes may be caused by different genetic defects which are transmitted in either dominant 
or recessive Mendelian inheritance. The underlying gene defects lead directly to the activation of the 
inflammasome and increased secretion of IL-1β (as in CAPS) or by indirect mechanisms activating the 
inflammasome in an unregulated way (as in HIDS/MKD, TRAPS or FMF). IL-1β induces the fever response in 
humans. Therefore, idiopathic fever attacks are suggestive of a dysregulation of the pathways leading to 
inflammasome activation. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Given the species-specificity of canakinumab, the marmoset monkey has been used in the nonclinical setting for 
understanding the pharmacokinetics of canakinumab (data provided at the time of the initial marketing 
authorisation). Table 3 provides a comparison of PK parameters in marmoset monkeys, rhesus monkeys, 
healthy volunteers and periodic fever syndrome patients.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
No new toxicology studies were performed. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
As a protein, canakinumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment  
According to Directive 2001/83/EC and Guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr2, medicinal products 
consisting of substances occurring naturally in the environment, such as electrolytes, vitamins, proteins etc. do 
not need to be accompanied by an environmental risk assessment because they are unlikely to result in 
significant risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical studies have been submitted which was considered acceptable by CHMP.

The applicant has sufficiently delineated the rationale for using canakinumab in patients with period fever 
syndromes based on literature data. The available data provided a sufficient rationale for blocking IL-1β in these 
indications. 
A comparison of PK parameters in marmoset monkey, rhesus monkey, healthy volunteers and patients with 
periodic fever syndromes was provided in this application. The available data provides a sufficiently high 
exposure multiple to support the proposed treatment in patients with periodic fever syndromes. 
No new toxicology studies were performed. However, toxicology of canakinumab in the liquid formulation was 
evaluated in a 13-week SC study in marmosets. This study was already reviewed at the time of MAA and 
supports the use of the proposed liquid formulation. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The available non-clinical data support the proposed line extension (canakinumab solution for injection in vial) 
and the variation to extend the indication. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
In order to obtain a marketing authorization of canakinumab for the treatment of Periodic Fever Syndromes 
(TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, and FMF) at a recommended dose of 150 mg (or 2 mg/kg in patient weighing ≤ 40 kg) 
administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks, data from four Phase II studies (D2203, D2402, D2204, DTR01) 
and one phase III study (N2301) in patients with the Periodic Fever Syndromes TRAPS, HIDS/MKDS, and 
colchicine resistant/intolerant Familial Mediterranean Fever (crFMF) were evaluated. 
CHMP scientific advice on quality and clinical development was received on 25 July 2013. 
The proposed indications of TRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF for canakinumab are supported by Paediatric 
Investigation Plans (PIP) which all have been completed and received positive opinion on compliance check from 
the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) on 26 February 2016. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried 
out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
•  Tabular overview of clinical studies 
The clinical studies conducted in patients with TRAPS, HIDS/MKD and crFMF patients are presented in the Table 
4 below. In addition, a BE study (Study A2104) of the comparability between the canakinumab solution in 
pre-filled syringe and the currently authorized lyophilized formulation was carried out.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Bioequivalence between marketed 150 mg powder for solution for injection and 150 mg solution for 
injection in pre-filled syringe (Study A2104) 
Study A2104 was a randomized, open-label, single-dose, parallel-group study in healthy subjects to determine 
the bioequivalence of a liquid presentation of ACZ885 (canakinumab) with respect to the powder for solution for 
injection ACZ885 following 150 mg subcutaneous administration. 
The primary objective was to demonstrate the bioequivalence of a single subcutaneous dose of a 150 mg 
solution for injection in pre-filled syringe with respect to the marketed 150 mg powder for solution for injection. 
Secondary objectives were to evaluate the safety and tolerability after a single subcutaneous dose of a solution 
for injection presentation of ACZ885 packaged in a pre-filled syringe and also to evaluate the 
pharmacodynamics of ACZ885 based on total IL-1β, after a single subcutaneous dose of a solution for injection 
of ACZ885 packaged in a pre-filled syringe and after a single subcutaneous dose of the powder for solution for 
injection presentation of ACZ885. 
Despite the minor difference in composition between solution for injection in pre-filled syringe (mannitol) and 
powder for solution for injection (sucrose), the bioequivalence study A2104 demonstrated the comparable 
systemic exposure of canakinumab between the two presentations.  
In addition, comparability of physicochemical properties between solution for injection in vial and powder for 
solution for injection has been shown by release testing, characterization test and stability test. 
Comparability of solutions for injection in pre-filled syringe and in vial

Canakinumab is available as powder for solution for injection, as a lyophilisate form that is reconstituted with 
Water for Injections for subcutaneous administration at 150 mg/mL. A canakinumab solution for injection in 
pre-filled syringe is also in clinical development (Phase 3 study CACZ885M2301). A new presentation solution 
for injection in vial has been developed and used in Study N2301. 
The solution for injection in pre-filled syringe and in vial has the same composition. The only difference is the 
primary packaging. However, the solution for injection in vial has a primary packaging the same as powder for 
solution for injection except for the size of the type I glass vial.  
The formulation for intended use and used in the pivotal phase 3 study is a solution in a vial instead of PFS, as 
the latter does not allow weight-based dosing required for the conduct of the study. It has the same composition 
as the solution in PFS. Extractable volume is considered comparable. Supportive evidence comes from the 
population PK model results which did not indicate a difference in bioavailability between the solution for 
injection in vial vs. powder for solution for injection.   
Pharmacokinetic in target population of PF syndromes 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) data from 20 TRAPS patients, 9 HDS/MKD patients and 16 crFMF patients are available 
from four phase II studies.  
In the Phase III study N2301, PK pre-dose samples at week 5, 9, 13 and 17 (representing Cmin) from n=181 
patients of all three cohorts were available. Only one sample (week 3) represented canakinumab concentration 
within a dose interval (2 weeks after administration of the first dose). In the group receiving 150 mg q4w (no 
flare) Cmin levels increased in all three disease cohorts from 6.5 - 10.4 mcg/mL up to 13.5 - 20 µg/mL after the 
4th dose. The highest canakinumab levels were observed in the TRAPS cohort, the lowest in the HIDS cohort. In 
the group of patients who up-titrated from 150 mg to 300 mg q4w (≥ 1 flare) mean Ctrough canakinumab levels 
at week 17 were increased in all cohorts (23-30 mcg/mL).  
The population PK study involved patients from studies N2301 (crFMF, HIDS/MKD, TRAPS, phase 3, up to day 
113), D2203 (TRAPS, phase 2 PoC up to day 253), D2304 (CAPS, phase 3 up to day 337), D2306 (CAPS, phase 
3, up to day 729), and D2308 (CAPS, phase 3, up to day 169). These data were used to describe the 
pharmacokinetics of ACZ885 in the new disease conditions of periodic fever syndromes (crFMF, HIDS/MKD, 
TRAPS) and assessing comparability with CAPS. The studies included several dosing regimens with 
subcutaneous administration. The population PK model was built based on 3318 ACZ885 serum concentrations 
from 362 patients with periodic fever syndromes and CAPS. 
Based on the population PK analysis, for a typical patient with Periodic Fever Syndromes (TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, 
and crFMF) weighing 55 kg (70 kg), the estimated serum clearance of canakinumab was 0.14 ± 0.04 L/day (0.17 
L/day). The corresponding volume of distribution was 4.96 ± 1.35 L. Serum clearance of canakinumab and its 
volume of distribution were dependent on bodyweight in an allometric relationship. The exponent for clearance 
was estimated to be 0.86 and 1.02 for the total volume of distribution. Canakinumab minimal concentration at 
steady state following 150 mg sc q4w dosing regimens was estimated to be 16.4 ± 7.4 mcg/mL. The estimated 
steady state AUCtau was 636.7 ± 260.2 μg.day/mL. The elimination half-life of canakinumab in crFMF, 
HIDS/MKD and TRAPS patients is about 25.7 ± 6.5 days. 
Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
There were no severely renal impaired subjects included in the Periodic Fever Syndromes (TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, 
and crFMF) studies. Since canakinumab is a human IgG immunoglobulin with large molecular size (~150 kDa), 
Assessment report  
EMA/26517/2017 
Page 16/60  
  
  
 
 
little intact immunoglobulin can be filtered by the kidney, hence little antibody is expected to be excreted in the 
urine. 
Impaired hepatic function 
No formal study has been performed with canakinumab in patients with impaired hepatic function as it is known 
that the majority of IgG elimination occurs via intracellular catabolism, following fluid-phase or receptor 
mediated endocytosis. 
Gender 
PK data from 171 male and 191 female patients were included in the population PK model from Periodic Fever 
Syndromes (TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, and crFMF) and CAPS studies. No gender-related difference was observed in 
canakinumab clearance after correction for bodyweight in either patient population. 
Race 
The database in the population PK model included 27 Japanese patients (8 from Periodic Fever Syndromes 
(TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, and crFMF)). Effect of ethnicity (Japanese vs. non- Japanese) was assessed by estimating 
relative changes on clearance in the final population PK model. The difference of the typical clearance between 
Japanese vs. non-Japanese patients was minimal. The ratio of the two estimated clearances were 1.07 and the 
corresponding 95% CI was within 20% (0.96-1.20), meeting the standard bioequivalence criteria. 
Weight 
The one-compartment model selected as base model already contained bodyweight as a covariate. The 
canakinumab clearance versus bodyweight relationship had an estimated allometric coefficient of 0.86 (95% CI: 
0.80 – 0.91).  
When stratified by bodyweight, approximately 20% higher exposure was predicted for trough concentrations at 
week 16 for the higher bodyweight group (> 40 kg) when given 150 mg q4w vs. the lower bodyweight group (
≤ 40 kg) given 2 mg/kg q4w (Figure 2).

Figure 2 – Simulated trough concentrations of canakinumab at week 16 stratified by bodyweight in patients

Elderly 
There were total of 10 elderly patients (3 patients with TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, and crFMF) included in the population 
PK model database. The body-weight normalized canakinumab clearance did not show any significant trend 
between ages 2 to 91 years. 
Children 
The database in the population PK model included 100 pediatric patients with Periodic Fever Syndromes (TRAPS, 
HIDS/MKD, and crFMF). The body-weight normalized canakinumab clearance did not show any significant trend 
under different age groups. 
Interactions 
There were approximately 87% of crFMF patients who took colchicine co-medication during Epoch 2 in study 
N2301. Effect of concomitant colchicine was assessed by estimating relative changes on canakinumab clearance 
in the final population PK model. The difference of the typical clearance between crFMF patients who used 
concomitant colchicine vs. not on colchicine was minimal. The ratio of the two estimated clearances were 0.98 
and the corresponding 95% CI was within 20% (0.9-1.07), meeting the standard bioequivalence criteria.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Total IL-1ß 
Canakinumab binding to human IL-1ß neutralizes its bioactivity and results in the formation of a 
canakinumab-IL-1ß complex. Since the complex is cleared slower than the free IL-1ß, an increase in total IL-1ß 
is usually observed after canakinumab administration. 
The same kit for determination of total IL-1ß in PF syndrome studies has been used as in previous studies. In 
study N2301, HIDS/MKD patients showed generally higher IL-1ß baseline values (up to 10 ng/L) compared to 
crFMF and TRAPS patients (< 1 ng/L).  
There was an observed separation between the 150 mg (2 mg/kg) and 300 mg (4 mg/kg) dose levels of median 
IL-1β levels. 
An increase in total IL-1ß after administration of canakinumab was observed in patients with Periodic Fever 
Syndromes. A trend for higher total IL-1ß concentrations at week 2 in non-responders was observed in all 
patients with Periodic Fever Syndromes (TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, and crFMF), especially in HIDS/MKD and TRAPS 
patients.  
Canakinumab treatment was associated with a decrease of IL-1ß-induced downstream mediators including 
IL-1ß pathway related genes, acute phase proteins such as serum amyloid (SAA) and C-reactive protein (CRP). 
Immunogenicity 
The recently developed Immunogenicity assay with improved drug tolerance has now been used in the phase 3 
study N2301 after it had been firstly applied in the SJIA Study G2301E1. In contrast, in studies D2203, D2402, 
D2204, and DTR01 the former assay was used for immunogenicity measurements. It was confirmed in 
cross-comparison measurements that both MSD based assays are capable of detecting anti-drug antibodies, but 
the improved MSD method provided a better performance in sensitivity and drug tolerance.  
In study N2301, during screening, 33 samples out of 639 were above the Screening Cut Point, but could not be 
confirmed in the second confirmation assay. Therefore, all samples were reported as immunogenicity negative. 
Overall, the incidence of treatment related anti-canakinumab antibodies was <1% in patients with Periodic 
Fever Syndromes (TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, and crFMF).  
PKPD relationship 
The exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety relationships of canakinumab in TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, and crFMF 
patients were investigated in the Phase III study N2301. Predicted canakinumab concentrations were 
approximately 30% lower in HIDS/MKD and TRAPS patients at the time of flare compared to no flare. 
Furthermore, in HIDS/MKD patients this trend was also observed in the subset of patients (11/15) in whom 
flares occurred despite up-titration to a dose of 300 mg or 4 mg/kg. In contrast, for crFMF patients there was no 
difference between concentrations at flare and no flare.  
An exposure-response model for the probability of flare suggested a difference in drug sensitivity between 
disease cohorts, with HIDS/MKD and TRAPS patients requiring approximately 10-fold higher drug 
concentrations to reach efficacy. 
While mean neutrophil levels decreased following canakinumab treatment, this did not translate into a higher 
occurrence of notable abnormalities (CTC grade ≥1) with increased concentrations of canakinumab. Likewise, 
Assessment report  
EMA/26517/2017 
Page 19/60  
  
  
 
 
the occurrence of notable abnormalities for lymphocytes count, leukocytes and platelets count did not increase 
with canakinumab concentrations either. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Three  PK-study  reports  have  been  submitted  in  order  to  support  this  application:  a  bioequivalence  study 
(ACZ885A2104),  popPK  study  of  ACZ885  in  patients  with  periodic  fever  syndromes  and  a  PK/PD  modelling 
report. 
The bioequivalence study A2104 demonstrated the comparable systemic exposure of canakinumab between a 
solution for injection in pre-filled syringe (PFS) and the currently authorized powder for solution for injection. 
However, the formulation for intended use and used in the pivotal phase 3 study is a solution in a vial instead of 
PFS. It has the same composition as the solution in PFS and the extractable volume is considered comparable. 
It is noted that the BE-study ACZ885A2104 has been performed with a liquid formulation of ACZ885 in pre-filled 
syringe. As this application concerns only a liquid formulation in a vial, comparability has been demonstrated at 
quality level of 1) the powder for solution of injection and solution for injection in prefilled syringe, 2) the powder 
for solution of injection and solution for injection in vial, and 3) the solution for injection in prefilled syringe and 
solution for injection in vial (see Quality section). Thus, the quality of ACZ885 is comparable for both 
presentations.  Supportive evidence for comparability comes from the population PK model analysis which did 
not indicate a difference in bioavailability between the solution for injection in vial vs. powder for solution for 
injection. Thus, bioequivalence can be assumed between all three formulations. 
With regard to bioanalytical methods used in this application, several concerns were raised during the 
procedure. The MAH responded to the concerns, however, there is still an overall concern on the consistency and 
reliable performance of the bioanalytical methods. Especially a) it seems that the commercial kit used for 
determination of IL-1β in human serum has a very high rate of inter-batch kit variability, b) in determination of 
anti-ACZ885 antibodies new reagent batches have caused signal inconsistencies across the MSD plates, c) there 
are clear deficiencies in the biological characterisation of the used control antibodies, d) a very high inter-run 
imprecision has been observed for the determination of neutralizing antibodies, the root-cause for the 
imprecision is unknown, e) the use of several different control antibodies in the transfer and validation of the 
assays hampers the comparison of assay performance. However, as these methods and analyses are not 
necessary for concluding on a positive benefit/risk balance of canakinumab in the treatment of the applied 
indications, these deficiencies are not pursued further during this variation procedure. Nevertheless, the 
following recommendation is made with regards to the reliability and consistency of the bioanalytical assays for 
the future: For future applications the characterisation of control antibodies should include also characterisation 
of functionality and the use of different types of control antibodies should be clearly considered and justified to 
allow also comparison of assays in, e.g., method transfer situations. The Applicant is recommended to introduce 
measures to appropriately control and qualify new reagent batches and commercial kits as well as to control the 
high imprecision and variability observed for the bioanalytical assays in order to avoid inconsistencies in assay 
performance. 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) data from 20 TRAPS patients, 9 HDS/MKD patients and 16 crFMF patients are available 
from four phase II studies. Descriptive PK statistics showed canakinumab levels as expected.  
In the Phase III study N2301, PK pre-dose samples from n= of all three cohorts were available. The highest 
canakinumab levels were observed in the TRAPS cohort, the lowest in the HIDS cohort. It is unclear whether this 
is confounded by body weight. 
Assessment report  
EMA/26517/2017 
Page 20/60  
  
  
 
 
Based on the population PK analysis, for a typical patient with Periodic Fever Syndromes (TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, 
and crFMF) the estimated serum clearance of canakinumab was in accordance with CL values obtained for other 
patient populations (e.g. CAPS, sJIA). 
A previous population PK-binding model of ACZ885 in CAPS patients (ACZ885 CAPS Extension Modeling Report) 
demonstrated that the PK data that was available for that analysis can be well described with a linear 
two-compartment model, first-order absorption for the sc administration and constant rate infusion for the 
intravenous administration. As the present dataset lacks rich sampling with sc dosing in periodic fevers 
syndromes, absorption rate and bioavailability were fixed in the present analysis at the previously estimated 
values in the CAPS patient population (ACZ885 CAPS Extension Modeling Report). This is considered 
appropriate. 
Overall, the PK characteristics of canakinumab observed in crFMF, HIDS/MKD and TRAPS patients are consistent 
with PK observed in other indications and are typical for a human IgG1 molecule following sc dose 
administration. However, it is noted that clearance estimates represent CL/F assuming a fixed value for Fabs = 
65 % (subcutaneous bioavailability) for all patients which was estimated in the first PKPD model analysis for 
CAPS patients. Therefore, variability in CL is also affected by possible differences in SC bioavailability between 
the patients and populations. The estimated individual clearances were generally consistent across all disease 
conditions in Periodic Fevers Syndromes after adjusting for body weight.  
Median Ctrough levels at week 16 in patients with PF syndromes were higher in the group > 40 kg (receiving 150 
mg) than in the group <= 40 kg body weight (receiving 2 mg/kg) (15 vs. 10 mcg/mL). This is expected due to 
the dosage regimen, since patients weighing 41-75 kg receive a relatively lower dose per kg (< 2 mg/kg) when 
applying 150 mg flat dose. Patients between 41-50 kg body weight receive the highest dose per kg (> 3 mg/kg). 
The applicant stated that clearance and volume of distribution were not impacted by age (above 2 years old) and 
albumin level at baseline in patients with Periodic Fever Syndromes (TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, or crFMF) after 
correction for the subject’s bodyweight.  
The intended dosage regimen (change from 2 mg/kg to 150 mg flat at 40 kg) is the same as authorised for CAPS 
patients with the exception of the dose interval which is 4-weekly here compared to 8-weekly in CAPS. 
Therefore, as expected from the dosage regimen, steady state levels reached in PFS patients are markedly 
higher than in CAPS patients and are in the average range of those in sJIA patients after 4 mg/kg q4w. 
The effect of colchicine co-medication in study N2301 (approximately 87% of crFMF patients took colchicine 
co-medication) was investigated by population PK analysis. The result support the conclusion that colchicine 
co-medication had no impact on pharmacokinetics of canakinumab in patients with Periodic Fever Syndromes 
(TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, and crFMF). 
An increase in total IL-1ß after administration of canakinumab indicating successful binding over time was 
observed in patients with Periodic Fever Syndromes. Further discussion on the reason for the observation of 
about 10-fold higher IL-1ß baseline values in HIDS/MKD patients and on the impact on the exposure-response 
relationship in this subgroup was requested.  
The MAH speculates that, differently from FMF and TRAPS, in HIDS/MKD the activation of the inflammasome, 
which triggers the conversion of inactive pro-IL1 into IL-1α and IL-1β may be activated through additional 
pathways not activated in the other 2 diseases, such as the impairment of the isoprenoid biosynthesis and 
provides literature references supporting this hypothesis. Furthermore, from the tendency of higher total IL-1β 
concentrations at day 15 in non-responders vs. responders which was particularly visible in HIDS/MKD, the MAH 
Assessment report  
EMA/26517/2017 
Page 21/60  
  
  
 
 
speculates that this could be the reason why such patients were more likely to require up-titration. Although 
speculative the explanations are considered plausible. 
The trend for higher total IL-1ß concentrations at week 2 in non-responders is in accordance with higher 
canakinumab exposure levels in these patients due to dose up-titration. There was a separation between 150 
mg (2 mg/kg) and 300 mg (4 mg/kg) dose levels, indicating availability of IL-1β for binding with a higher dose 
of the drug. 
Canakinumab treatment was associated with a decrease of IL-1ß-induced downstream mediators including 
IL-1ß pathway related genes and acute phase proteins. This adds to the evidence that canakinumab neutralizes 
the activity and down-regulates the production of IL-1ß in vivo. 
Canakinumab showed a low immunogenicity potential in PF syndrome patients (< 1%), even lower than 
observed before in other populations (up to 3% in gouty arthritis). The applicant was requested to discuss the 
possible reasons including the impact of the change from sucrose to mannitol in the formulation. 
The MAH is of the opinion that the lower incidence of immunogenicity reported in study N2301 is not related to 
the change in stabilizer from sucrose to mannitol, but could rather be attributed to a better specificity of the new 
ADA assay. The explanation that the new assay is more specific (i.e. produced less false positives) is supported 
by the cross-validation results. But in contrast, the gained improvement in sensitivity on the other hand favours 
an increase in the number of true positive samples which is in opposite to the observed lower overall ADA 
incidence. However, it is agreed that it is an early stage of collecting immunogenicity data with this new assay. 
The ability to detect a neutralising antibody response is very low during therapy due to the low drug tolerance 
of the Nab assay (3.4 µg/mL). However, since no positive screening results were detected in study N2301, this 
is less relevant in this case. 
An exposure-response relationship between the probability of flare and canakinumab serum concentrations was 
observed in patients with Periodic Fever syndromes. The reason for the different sensitivity in the relationships 
between the subpopulations is unclear. The finding that HIDS/MKD and TRAPS patients require approximately 
10-fold higher drug concentrations to reach efficacy is consistent with the greater need of up-titration observed 
in these two disease conditions in study N2301. 
No clear exposure-safety relationship was observed. This is in accordance with previous observations in other 
indications. While mean neutrophil levels decreased following canakinumab treatment, this did not translate into 
a higher occurrence of notable abnormalities (CTC grade ≥1) with increased concentrations of canakinumab. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The data submitted was considered acceptable by CHMP. 
However, with regard to bioanalytical methods used in this application, several concerns were raised during the 
procedure. 
As such, CHMP has recommended that for future applications the characterisation of control antibodies should 
include also characterisation of functionality and the use of different types of control antibodies should be clearly 
considered and justified to allow also comparison of assays in, e.g., method transfer situations. The Applicant 
should introduce measures to appropriately control and qualify new reagent batches and commercial kits as well 
as to control the high imprecision and variability observed for the bioanalytical assays in order to avoid 
inconsistencies in assay performance.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The initial canakinumab dosing regimen defined for Study N2301 (150 mg sc or 2 mg/kg sc) was based on 
evidence in approved indications (e.g., CAPS - [Study A2102]) and from completed open-label Phase 2 studies 
in crFMF, HIDS/MKD and TRAPS. Because of the rarity of these 3 conditions, no formal dose finding study was 
conducted. 
2.5.2.  Main study 
A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study of canakinumab in patients with Hereditary 
Periodic Fevers (TRAPS, HIDS, or crFMF), with subsequent randomized withdrawal/dosing 
frequency reduction and open-label long term treatment epochs 
Methods 
Study Participants  
The study population consisted of male and female patients (≥2 years old) with clinically and genetically 
confirmed hereditary periodic fevers: TRAPS (cohort 1), HIDS (cohort 2), and crFMF (cohort 3). 
The study population consisted of male and female patients ≥ 2 years of age at the time of the screening visit 
for the randomized cohorts and patients > 28 days but < 2 years old for the nonrandomized treatment arm. 
For randomized crFMF patients: diagnosis of type 1 FMF disease according to Tel Hashomer criteria but no active 
flare at the time of screening, at least one of the known MEFV gene exon 10 mutations, and 1 of the following 2 
criteria: documented active disease despite colchicine therapy or documented intolerance to effective doses of 
colchicine. At randomization, patients must have had acute crFMF flare characterized by inflammation and 
serositis, active clinical crFMF flare as evidenced by PGA ≥ 2, and CRP > 10 mg/L. 
For randomized HIDS patients: clinical diagnosis of HIDS but no active flare at the time of screening, 
genetic/enzymatic diagnosis of HIDS, and prior documented history of ≥ 3 febrile acute HIDS flares in a 6-month 
period when not receiving prophylactic treatment. At randomization, patients must have had active clinical HIDS 
flare as evidenced by PGA ≥ 2 and CRP > 10 mg/L. 
For randomized TRAPS patients: clinical diagnosis of TRAPS but no active flare at the time of screening, mutation 
of the TNFRSF1A gene, and chronic or recurrent disease activity periodicity. At randomization, patients must 
have had active clinical TRAPS flare as evidenced by PGA ≥ 2 and CRP > 10 mg/L. 
Treatments 
Canakinumab solution for injection was provided in vials that contained 150 mg/mL canakinumab in a 1 mL 
solution. 
Placebo solution for injection was provided in vials and matched the canakinumab solution. 
Total duration of treatment is up to 113 weeks. As of the data cut-off date for this primary analysis (end of Epoch 
2), all patients completed Week 16 of treatment.

Objectives 
This clinical study report presents primary, secondary and exploratory endpoint efficacy and safety results up to 
the end of Epoch 2. All results for objectives pertaining to Epochs 3 and 4 will be reported separately. 
The primary hypothesis tested was the superiority of canakinumab (150 mg or 2mg/kg q4w) relative to placebo 
with respect to the proportion of responders in the randomized treatment epoch (Epoch 2). 
The primary objective of the randomized treatment epoch (Epoch 2) and of the overall study is to demonstrate 
that canakinumab treatment at a dose of 150 mg (or 2 mg/kg in patient weighing ≤ 40 kg) sc every 4 weeks is 
superior to placebo in achieving a clinically meaningful reduction of disease activity defined as resolution of the 
index flare at Day 15 and no new disease flares over 16 weeks of treatment (up to the end of Epoch 2). 
The secondary objectives of the study (Epoch 2 only) are: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate the percentage of patients who achieve a Physician Global Assessment of disease activity (PGA) 
< 2 (“minimal” or “none”) at the end of Week 16 
To evaluate the percentage of patients with the serologic remission at the end of Week 16 (defined as 
C-reactive protein (CRP) ≤ 10 mg/L) 
To evaluate the percentage of patients with normalized serum amyloid A (SAA) level at the end of Week 16 
(defined as SAA ≤ 10 mg/L) 
To evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability and immunogenicity of canakinumab 
To evaluate the pharmacokinetics/ pharmacodynamics of canakinumab 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy assessments consisted of the following: resolution of the index flare, new disease flare, Physician Global 
Assessment of Disease Activity (PGA), inflammatory markers (CRP and SAA), Patient/Parent’s Global 
Assessment (PPGA), physician’s severity assessment of key disease-specific signs and symptoms, number of 
fever episodes, use of rescue medication, and improvements in health related-quality of life measurements as 
assessed with the Auto-Inflammatory Disease Activity Index (AIDAI), Child Health Questionnaire – Parent Form 
50 (CHQ-PF50), Medical Outcome Short Form (12) Health Survey (SF-12) and Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). 
The primary efficacy variable of the randomized treatment epoch (Epoch 2) and for the overall study was the 
proportion of responders within each cohort.  
A responder was defined as a patient who had resolution of his/her index disease flare at Day 15 (PGA < 2, and 
CRP within normal range (≤ 10 mg/L) or reduction ≥ 70% from baseline) and did not experience a new flare 
(PGA ≥ 2 and CRP ≥ 30 mg/L) from the time of the resolution of the index flare until the end of Epoch 2. 
Sample size 
It was calculated that with a sample size of 28 subjects per treatment group Fisher's exact test with a 2.5% 
one-sided significance level would have 90% power to detect a treatment difference of 45% assuming a 
responder rate of 65% for the canakinumab treatment group and of 20% in the placebo group within each of the 
3 disease cohorts (crFMF, HIDS/MKD, TRAPS). Rounded to 30 subjects per treatment arm and disease cohort, 
a total of 180 patients were to be enrolled.  
Assessment report  
EMA/26517/2017 
Page 24/60  
  
  
 
 
 
 
Due to recruitment difficulties only 46 TRAPS patients were randomized, providing about 83% power to detect 
a treatment difference of 45%. 
Randomisation 
At baseline of epoch 2 subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Canakinumab 150 mg or 
placebo. Randomization was stratified for disease cohort. 
All patients randomized to canakinumab in epoch 2 and completing epoch 2 were to then be re-randomized (in 
epoch 3) in a ratio of 1:1 to receive either Canakinumab or placebo. 
Randomisation was performed via IRT. 
Blinding (masking) 
Patients, investigator staff, persons performing the assessments, and data analysts remained blind to the 
identity of the randomized treatment assignment until week 16 database lock for the primary endpoint analysis, 
performed once all patients had completed epoch 2. 
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy parameter, proportion of responders at week 16, was analysed separately for each disease 
cohort (crFMF, HIDS/MKD, TRAPS) based on the FAS (all patients randomized to epoch 2 who received at least 
1 dose of study drug). Patients who needed dose escalation in the canakinumab arms, who crossed-over from 
placebo to canakinumab, or who discontinued from the study due to any reason prior to evaluating the primary 
endpoint were considered as non-responders in the analysis. 
The primary hypothesis tested was the superiority of canakinumab relative to placebo with respect to the 
proportion of responders. Within each disease cohort this hypothesis was tested at a one-sided 2.5% level by 
means of Fisher’s exact test. The proportion of responders (including its 95%-CI according Clopper-Pearson) as 
well as the odds ratio and risk difference between treatments with the corresponding 95% CI was presented for 
each disease cohort. 
For sensitivity purposes the primary analysis was repeated using the PPS and using a definition of the resolution 
of the index flare and new flare based on centralized SAA values. Further sensitivity analyses of the primary 
efficacy parameter were performed to assess the robustness of study results. 
The secondary efficacy parameters at week 16 (frequency of patients a) with PGA < 2, b) in serologic remission 
(defined as CRP ≤ 10 mg/L), c) with a normalized SAA level at week 16 (defined as SAA ≤ 10 mg/L)) were 
analyzed using a logistic regression model with treatment group and baseline PGA, CRP or SAA as explanatory 
variables. 
The primary and secondary efficacy variables were analyzed within the following subgroups: prior use of any 
biologics (no, yes), age groups (< 18 years, ≥ 18 years), and colchicine status (negative, positive; performed 
for the crFMF cohort only). 
In order to control the type I error (within each disease cohort) a hierarchical testing procedure was applied 
separately for each disease cohort (testing was continued as long as each test showed statistical significance at 
the 2.5% level (1-sided)):

Results 
Conduct of the study 
The study protocol was amended twice. The key features of each amendment are given below: 
Amendment 1 (15-Jul-2014) introduced the following changes: 
- 
changed Section 6.5.6 Pregnancy and assessments of fertility to reference the use of effective 
contraception in accordance with locally approved prescribing information 
Amendment 2 (22-Oct-2014) introduced the following changes: 
- 
updated exploratory objectives to reflect the request from the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) at the 
European Medicines Agency to include patients > 28 days but < 2 years of age in addition to patients ≥ 
2 years of age 
- 
clarified how patients in the randomized and non-randomized cohorts were managed: 
- 
- 
- 
study entry time and treatment was harmonized between the patients who were > 28 days but 
< 2 years of age and Japanese crFMF patients with non-exon 10 mutations 
clarified the definition of the resolution of index flare 
clarified the blinded escape criteria 
Both amendments were not considered to have affected the interpretation of study results as they occurred prior 
to study unblinding for the Week 16 primary endpoint analysis. 
Other changes in study conduct 
Study recruitment was stopped when 2/3 of patients were enrolled in the slowest enrolling cohort (TRAPS). The 
aim to randomize at least 60 patients per cohort was achieved for crFMF and HIDS/MKD cohorts (63 and 72 
patients randomized, respectively). As recruitment in the TRAPS cohort was difficult due to the extreme rarity of 
the disease, overall study recruitment was stopped when 46 TRAPS patients were randomized.

Baseline data 
Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were generally comparable between the randomized 
canakinumab and placebo groups in all 3 disease cohorts. The studied population of crFMF, HIDS/MKD and 
TRAPS patients all had genetic and past medical history of the respective disease, as per inclusion criteria, and 
also had active disease as defined by clinical and serological criteria at the time of randomization. 
- 
For crFMF cohort, the mean age was 22 years and 46% of the cohort was < 18 years old, with 3 patients 
< 6 years old. The proportion of males and females was well balanced. Most crFMF patients were 
Caucasian and all had confirmed mutation in the MEFV gene. The median duration of disease was 14.7 
years, with a median 18 flares per year, and most patients had PGA moderate or severe disease activity. 
- 
For HIDS/MKD cohort, the mean age was 13.5 years and 75% of the cohort was < 18 years old, with 17 
patients < 6 years old. There were slightly more females (59.7%) than males (40.3%). Most HIDS/MKD 
patients were Caucasian and all had confirmed mutation in the MVK (mevalonate kinase) gene. The 
median duration of disease was 9.8 years, with a median 12 flares per year, and the majority of patients 
had PGA moderate or severe disease activity. 
- 
For TRAPS cohort, the mean age was 22 years and 59% of the cohort was < 18 years old, with 7 patients 
< 6 years old. There was an equal number of males and females. Most TRAPS patients were Caucasian 
and all had confirmed mutation in the TNFRSF1A gene. The median duration of disease was 8.2 years, 
with a median 9 flares per year, and over half of patients had PGA moderate (47.8%) or severe (8.7%) 
disease. 
Numbers analysed 
A total of 180 patients (60 per cohort, 30 per treatment arm) were planned to be randomized. A total of 181 
patients were randomized and 4 patients entered the non-randomized open-label treatment arm. 
In the crFMF cohort, 100 patients were screened and 63 patients were randomized (31 to 150 mg q4w 
canakinumab and 32 to placebo). In the HIDS/MKD cohort, 98 patients were screened and 72 patients were 
randomized (37 to 150 mg q4w canakinumab and 35 to placebo). In the TRAPS cohort, 82 patients were 
screened and 46 patients were randomized (22 to 150 mg q4w canakinumab and 24 to placebo). All randomized 
patients were included in the Full Analysis Set (for efficacy analysis) and the Safety set (for safety analysis). 
Four non-randomized patients (2 crFMF patients with non-exon 10 mutations and 2 HIDS/MKD patients > 28 
days but < 2 years old) received open-label treatment. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The primary endpoint was met for all three cohorts and canakinumab was statistically superior to placebo in 
resolving the index disease flare at day 15 and in preventing new flares before the end of week 16. The best 
results can be seen for the crFMF cohort (one-sided p-value: < 0.0001) and slightly weaker response, although 
still statistically significant, in the TRAPS cohort (one-sided p-value: 0.0050). 
More patients achieved a complete response with canakinumab than with placebo, regardless of age, prior use 
of biologics and concomitant use of colchicine (for crFMF). Although the majority of patients were well-controlled 
with canakinumab 150 mg q4w, 16% of crFMF patients, 32% of HIDS/MKD patients and 36% of TRAPS patients 
required dose escalation to 300 mg q4w.

Table 5 – Primary analysis: comparison between treatment groups for the proportion of responders after 16 
weeks by cohort (Full analysis set) 
The study included the option for dose escalation in case the index flare did not resolve by day 15.  This escape 
option had to be used by 16% of crFMF patients, 32% of HIDS/MKD patients, and 36%of TRAPS patients. 
However, this option enabled especially crFMF and TRAPS patients to reach resolution of index flare by day 29. 
In the HIDS cohort, only 4 of 15 patients (26.7%) achieved the resolution of index flare after dose escalation at 
day 29. This corresponds to the primary endpoint results in this cohort with 35.14% responders in comparison 
to 61.29% in crFMF patients and 45.45% in TRAPS patients. Though, as the primary endpoint is met in all three 
cohorts this is not of major relevance. 
The majority of crFMF, HIDS/MKD and TRAPS patients did not re-flare over 16 weeks of treatment in Epoch 2. 
Among canakinumab-treated patients (150 mg or 300 mg q4w), 90.3%, 64.9% and 77.3% of crFMF, HIDS/MKD 
and TRAPS patients, respectively, had no new flare (i.e., PGA ≥ 2 and CRP ≥ 30 mg/L) after resolution of the 
index flare up to the end of Week 16. 
Secondary efficacy results 
Canakinumab was superior to placebo in the secondary endpoints of PGA < 2 and CRP ≤ 10 mg/L at Week 16 in 
crFMF, HIDS/MKD and TRAPS cohorts based on results of the testing hierarchy. For SAA ≤ 10 mg/L at Week 16, 
canakinumab showed greater improvements in all disease cohorts, with a statistically significant difference for 
TRAPS patients. 
- 
In each randomized cohort, a significantly higher proportion of patients in the 150 mg q4w canakinumab 
group achieved a PGA score < 2 (no to minimal disease activity) at the end of Epoch 2 compared with placebo. 
Canakinumab was superior to placebo for PGA < 2 after 16 weeks for crFMF (OR=16.96, p<0.0001), HIDS/MKD 
(OR=13.63, p=0.0006), and TRAPS (OR=23.79, p=0.0028) 
- 
In each randomized cohort, a significantly higher proportion of patients in the canakinumab 150 mg q4w 
group achieved serological remission defined as CRP ≤ 10 mg/L at the end of Epoch 2 compared with placebo. 
Canakinumab was superior to placebo for CRP ≤ 10 mg/L after 16 weeks for crFMF (OR=29.78, p<0.0001), 
HIDS/MKD (OR=12.71, p=0.0010) and TRAPS (OR=6.64, p=0.0149). 
- 
Canakinumab normalized SAA to ≤ 10 mg/L for a significantly higher proportion of patients in the TRAPS 
cohort compared with placebo after 16 weeks (OR=16.69, p=0.0235). There were also greater improvements in 
the normalization of SAA at Week 16 with canakinumab treatment in crFMF patients (25.81% vs. 0% for 
placebo) and in HIDS/MKD patients (13.51% vs. 2.86% for placebo).

Exploratory analyses of the secondary endpoints showed that dose escalation further improved response rates 
for PGA < 2, CRP ≤ 10 mg/L and SAA ≤ 10 mg/L after 16 weeks. The proportion of patients with PGA < 2 (10%, 
22% and 23% higher, respectively, for crFMF, HIDS/MKD and TRAPS cohorts), CRP ≤ 10 mg/L (7%, 8% and 
27% higher, respectively) or with SAA ≤ 10 mg/L (5% higher for both HIDS/MKD and TRAPS; no change for 
crFMF) increased with up-titration to 300 mg q4w canakinumab before Day 29. 
Table 6 – Results for the primary and secondary efficacy variables after 16 weeks by cohort (Full analysis set) 
Physician Global Assessment (PGA) improvement over time 
Rapid and sustained improvements in PGA disease activity scores were observed in patients randomised to 
receive treatment with Ilaris 150 mg every 4 weeks across all three disease cohorts. A high proportion of 
patients shifted from “moderate” or “severe” (PGA > 2) to “no” or “minimal” disease activity (PGA < 2) as early 
as day 15, and this response was maintained up to the end of Part II. 
Auto-inflammatory disease activity index score (AIDAI) 
The AIDAI score is a daily patient diary made up of the following 12 components: fever, ≥ 38°C, overall 
symptoms, abdominal pain; nausea/vomiting, diarrhoea, headaches, chest pain, painful nodes, arthralgia or 
myalgia, swelling of the joints, eye manifestations, and skin rash. Overall, reductions in the median AIDAI score 
were observed by week 2 for patients randomised to Ilaris 150 mg every 4 weeks and continued up to the end 
of week 16 in all three disease cohorts. 
Time to fever resolution 
The median time to first resolution of fever was 1 to 1.5 days shorter for patients randomised to Ilaris 150 mg 
every 4 weeks compared with placebo in all three disease cohorts.

Health-related quality of life measurements 
Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12): SF-12 covers domains of both physical and mental health and was 
administered in patients 18 years of age and older. Increases in the median physical component and mental 
component summary scores (PCS and MCS) were observed by day 29, with PCS further improving at week 16. 
The PCS was close to that of healthy population norms at week 16. 
Child Health Questionnaire-Parent Form 50 (CHQ-PF50): The CHQ-PF50 covers domains of physical and 
psychosocial health, assessing a child’s quality of life from the parent’s perspective. Increases in median 
physical summary scores were observed by day 29 and maintained to week 16 across cohorts, likewise for 
psychosocial summary scores in the FMF and HIDS/MKD cohorts. 
The results of the secondary and exploratory efficacy analysis support the results of the primary endpoint. It is 
shown that treatment with canakinumab is able to normalize the CRP levels in all three disease cohorts in a 
statistically significant way in comparison to placebo. Furthermore, evaluation of PGA shows a reduction to <2 
also in a statistically significant way for 64.52% of crFMF, 45.95% of HIDS and 45.45% of TRAPS patients. 
These results are regarded as clinically meaningful improvement of disease status after 3 months of treatment. 
Ancillary analyses 
Age 
Canakinumab showed greater efficacy compared to placebo with the respect to the proportion of responders 
after 16 weeks in both age subgroups across all 3 disease cohorts (Table 7). Similar results were also observed 
for the secondary efficacy endpoints of PGA < 2 and CRP ≤ 10 mg/L in crFMF, HIDS/MKD and TRAPS patients. For 
SAA ≤ 10 mg/L, canakinumab was more efficacious than placebo in both age subgroups in crFMF patients, while 
in HIDS/MKD and TRAPS patients this effect was apparent in patients < 18 years old but not in the very small 
number of HIDS/MKD and TRAPS patients ≥ 18 years old.

Concomitant use of colchicine (crFMF patients) 
Most (87.3%) crFMF patients were taking concomitant colchicine during Epoch 2. In this subgroup, 
canakinumab showed greater efficacy than placebo with respect to the proportion of responders after 16 weeks 
(Table 8). The risk difference in favor of canakinumab vs. placebo (62%) in patients taking concomitant 
colchicine was of similar magnitude as that in the overall population (55%; Table 8), indicating the added benefit 
of canakinumab beyond that provided by colchicine therapy. These treatment differences were demonstrated on 
top of the maximal tolerated colchicine dose. Both the canakinumab and placebo group received comparable 
daily colchicine doses (1.6±0.89 and 1.7±0.63 mg/day, respectively), and treatment responders (1.5±0.86 
mg/day) did not receive higher doses of colchicine vs. non-responders (1.7±0.71 mg/day). 
Table 8 – Comparison between treatment groups for primary and secondary efficacy endpoints in crFMF 
patients after 16 weks by concomitant colchicine use (Full analysis set) 
Prior use of biologics 
A small proportion of patients had prior exposure to biologics (23.8% of crFMF patients; 18.1% of HIDS/MKD 
patients; and 34.8% of TRAPS patients). In this subgroup of patients with prior exposure to biologics, there were 
more responders in Epoch 2 in the canakinumab group than in the placebo group for the crFMF cohort and TRAPS 
cohort (Table 9). In the HIDS/MKD cohort, 1 patient in the canakinumab group was a responder compared with 
0 patients in the placebo group. The responder profile among patients without prior exposure to biologics was 
similar to the overall population, with a higher proportion of patients on canakinumab compared to placebo 
achieving a complete response in all 3 disease cohorts (Table 9). Similarly, there were slightly more patients 
with PGA < 2, CRP ≤ 10 mg/L or SAA ≤ 10 mg/L in the canakinumab group compared with the placebo group in 
crFMF, HIDS/MKD and TRAPS patients, although comparisons are limited by the very small number of patients 
with prior use of biologics.

Notes 
With the exception of SAA response in the HIDS/MKD cohort, the secondary 
efficacy endpoints indicate a statistically significant superiority of 
Canakinumab when compared to placebo in all 3 disease cohorts. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
There was no pooling of efficacy data from the randomized, placebo-controlled pivotal Phase 3 studies and the 
4 open-label, uncontrolled Phase 2 studies, as the study design, efficacy variables and dosing regimens differ 
across the studies. 
Supportive studies 
Four uncontrolled studies contributed for further efficacy data in the target population of periodic fever 
syndromes. Efficacy measurements were made relative to baseline values. The design of the earlier uncontrolled 
Phase 2 POC trials in crFMF, HIDS/MKD and TRAPS is briefly summarized in Table 11.

Table 11 – Summary of uncontrolled phase 2 studies in crFMF, HIDS/MKD and TRAPS 
The results of 9 patients in study DTR01 can be regarded as supportive and provide some evidence that 
treatment with canakinumab in patients with crFMF is able to reduce the number of attacks and at least prolongs 
the time to the next attack. During the follow up period without active treatment, median time to subsequent 
disease attack was 71 days. This is a clinically important finding although the number of treated patients is 
rather too small to draw final conclusions. 
Study D2204 included 7 children with crFMF. Patients aged between 4 and 20 years were treated every 4 weeks 
with the now proposed dosing regimen of canakinumab for crFMF. The presented results are very promising 
although the patient numbers are small. Canakinumab treatment led to a pronounced reduction in disease 
flare/attack rate which is medically very important. Also the improvement of laboratory parameters shows that 
the underlying inflammatory process is markedly reduced. 
Study D2402 in HIDS/MKD patients used a slightly different dosing regimen of 300mg every 6 weeks with 
options for additional dosing. Study D2402 enrolled 9 patients with a median time since diagnosis of 4.1 years, 
age range of 5-29 years and with genetically or enzymatically approved HIDS. The included patients can be 
regarded as representative for the periodic fever syndrome HIDS/MKD. The primary endpoint of study D2402 in 
patients with HIDS/MKD was met as the median number of flares per patient decreased from 5 (range: 3-12) in 
Assessment report  
EMA/26517/2017 
Page 37/60  
  
  
 
 
 
 
the 6-month run-in period to 0 (range: 0-2) during the 6-month treatment period. The assessment of 
HIDS/MKD control by patient and physician improved from no disease control or poor control at baseline to good 
or excellent control at Day 4 until the end of the study. Laboratory parameters (CRP, SAA) normalized starting 
at Day 15 and this was sustained through the end of study. Canakinumab treatment therefore reduced the HIDS 
flare rate and reduced the flare severity. The results of this pilot study are supportive for the overall efficacy of 
canakinumab treatment in periodic fever syndromes and are clinically highly relevant for the affected patients. 
Study D2203 was a pilot study for TRAPS in 20 patients. Study design and enrolment criteria are appropriate to 
allow assessment of efficacy, though in an open label setting, for this rare disease in a well-defined patient 
population. To be included into the study, the patients had to have a mutation of TNFRSF1A gen. Dosing scheme 
in study D2203 corresponds to the proposed dosing for periodic fever syndromes. 
The primary objective of Study D2203 in patients with TRAPS was met. 19/20 (95.0%) patients achieved a 
complete or almost complete response at Day 15. Of the 19 patients with a complete/almost complete response 
at Day 15, 16 patients achieved this outcome already by day 8 and the remaining 3 patients did so by Day 15. 
Furthermore, CRP and SAA levels decreased qickly until day 8 and stayed in the normal range for four month. 
With respect to physician`s global assessment of TRAPS, there was a shift to less disease activity for all patients 
during the treatment period and all patients had no or minimal disease activity at Day 113. These results are 
clinically relevant in the target population and are supportive for the overall efficacy of canakinumab in the 
proposed new indication TRAPS. 
Data on sustained efficacy in long term use is still very limited (29 patients) and so far can be regarded as 
supportive only.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
A single pivotal Phase 3 study, N2301, which includes 3 randomized cohorts (one cohort per condition: crFMF, 
HIDS/MKD and TRAPS), was submitted in support of this application. 
The study design followed the scientific advices received and is regarded as appropriate to investigate the 
efficacy in the proposed indications. No major protocol violations were recorded. 
All patients in the crFMF, HIDS/MKD and TRAPS cohorts of study N2301 had a medical history of the respective 
condition as well as a confirmed genetic mutation. All patients had active disease as defined by clinical and 
serological criteria at the time of randomization. crFMF patients were either experiencing active disease despite 
colchicine therapy or were intolerant to effective doses of colchicine. 
The chosen primary endpoint and the time point of assessment allowed appropriate evaluation of efficacy in 
comparison to placebo control. 
Four uncontrolled studies contributed further efficacy data in the target population of periodic fever syndromes. 
Efficacy measurements were made relative to baseline values. The methods used for the efficacy evaluation 
were comparable across the studies. The primary and secondary endpoints of the pivotal study were more 
robust than the ones used in the phase 2 studies and adequate to demonstrate a clinically relevant treatment 
response. The methods for blinding in the pivotal study were acceptable. The reported protocol deviations 
during the pivotal study seem not to have confounded the interpretation of the study results, as verified by Per 
Protoxol analysis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/26517/2017 
Page 38/60  
  
  
 
 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In study N2301, 181 patients were randomized and 4 patients entered the non-randomized open label period. 
63 crFMF patients were randomized, 72 with HIDS/MKD, and 46 patients with TRAPS. In view of the rarity of the 
three periodic fever syndromes, the numbers that were recruited and randomized are sufficient to evaluate 
efficacy. 
The data shows that the primary endpoint was met for all three cohorts and that canakinumab was statistically 
superior to placebo in resolving the index disease flare at day 15 and in preventing new flares before the end of 
week 16. The best results can be seen for the crFMF cohort and slightly weaker response, although still 
statistically significant, in the TRAPS cohort. The study included the option for dose escalation in case the index 
flare did not resolve by day 15. This escape option had to be used by 16% of crFMF patients, 32% of HIDS/MKD 
patients, and 36% of TRAPS patients. However, this option enabled especially crFMF and TRAPS patients to 
reach resolution of index flare by day 29. 
The results of the secondary and exploratory efficacy analysis support the results of the primary endpoint. It is 
shown that treatment with canakinumab is able to normalize the CRP levels in all three disease cohorts in a 
statistically significant way in comparison to placebo. Furthermore, evaluation of PGA shows a reduction to <2 
also in a statistically significant way. These results are regarded as clinically meaningful improvement of disease 
status after 3 month of treatment. 
In the exploratory analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint where the responder rate was expanded to include 
all the patients who achieved resolution of the index flare at Day 29 and no new flare after Day 29 up to the end 
of the 16-week treatment period with either the randomized treatment or with an up-titration to 300 mg q4w 
before Day 29, the proportion of responders increased to 71%, 72% and 57% in the crFMF, TRAPS and HIDS 
cohorts, respectively. The results of this analysis are clinically very relevant. As suggested by this analysis and 
also by the exploratory analysis of the need for blinded escape medication, it can be suggested that the patients 
with HIDS or TRAPS may need somewhat higher doses of canakinumab for full treatment response compared to 
the crFMF patients. The proportion of the patients with need for up-titration of canakinumab from Days 8 to 28 
was somewhat higher in the HIDS and TRAPS cohorts compared to the crFMF cohort. An initial dose of 
canakinumab 150 mg given every 4 weeks and with possibility for up-titration to 300 mg every 4 weeks is 
justified from efficacy point of view in all applied indications. The PK/PD-modelling suggests that some 
HIDS-patients who were uncontrolled at 300 mg could benefit from a higher dose to reduce new flares. The MAH 
was requested to present and discuss all the available data in this context and it is agreed by CHMP that the 
present limited clinical data do not justify the recommendation for increasing the dose in some HIDS-patients 
>300mg. 
All presented subgroup analyses are supportive to the primary and secondary analysis. Due to the partly very 
small cohorts of patients, the possibility to draw conclusions is limited. Subgroup analyses with regard to age, 
prior use of biological therapy and concomitant use of colchicine do not show any clear signals of reduced or 
improved efficacy. 
Only two patients in the canakinumab group and 6 patients in the placebo group were not taking concomitant 
colchicine. Therefore, the proposed indication for the patients with contraindication or intolerance to colchicine 
was questioned. As colchicine is available as a licenced medicinal product for the treatment of FMF only in some 
Member States of the EU (Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Slovakia and United Kingdom), the MAH was requested 
to discuss the possibility of extrapolating the results of concomitant use of colchicine and canakinumab in the 
colchicine resistant FMF to the use of canakinumab as a single agent in the treatment of crFMF and colchicine 
naïve FMF, i.e. regardless of the prior/ concomitant use of colchicine, based on all available data and literature. 
Assessment report  
EMA/26517/2017 
Page 39/60  
  
  
 
 
According to the MAH, the data of the patients without concomitant or prior use of colchicine is too limited for 
reliable extrapolation of the effect of canakinumab in this FMF sub-population. It is acknowledged that there is 
a clinical need for the treatment of FMF in these relatively rare patients with a contraindication, intolerance or 
insufficient response to colchicine, or in colchicine naïve patients who do not have access to colchicine therapy 
(as colchicine is not licenced for the treatment of FMF in many Member States). On the other hand, it is 
recommended in the recent EULAR recommendation for the treatment of FMF that "colchicine should be 
co-administered with alternative biological therapies given that it may reduce the risk of amyloidosis despite 
persistence of attacks". Further, there is biological plausibility that canakinumab would have similar effect in the 
treatment of FMF without colchicine.  
Taking into account all the above-mentioned aspects, the indication was changed as follows to cover all FMF 
patients with a potential to benefit from canakinumab treatment:  
Ilaris is indicated for the treatment of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). Ilaris should be given in combination 
with colchicine, if appropriate. 
In the relatively small subgroup of patients (44 out of 181 participants) with prior use of biologics, the proportion 
of responders in the canakinumab group was of the same magnitude as in the overall crFMF and TRAPS cohorts. 
In contrast, the corresponding proportion was unexpectedly low (1 out of 9 patients) in the HIDS cohort. The 
MAH adequately discussed the possible reasons of this finding in the HIDS population. 
Data on sustained efficacy in long term use is still very limited and needs further evaluation. Data presented so 
far can be regarded as supportive only. However, the MAH presented with the response to questions an interim 
study report presenting the results of Epoch 3 (week 40). After reviewing these results it can be concluded that 
treatment with canakinumab 150 mg given at the extended q8w dosing interval provided sufficient disease 
control for more than half of crFMF and TRAPS patients, while the majority of HIDS/MKD patients required a 
higher exposure (canakinumab 150 mg q4w, 300 mg q8w, or 300 mg q4w) to maintain disease control. 
Improvements in CRP, SAA, and PGA from study baseline were sustained throughout the duration of Epoch 3.  
Four uncontrolled open label studies (DTR01and D2204 in crFMF, D2402 in HIDS/MKD, D2203 in TRAPS) 
contributed with further supportive efficacy data in the target population of periodic fever syndromes. Efficacy 
measurements were made relative to baseline values.  
The presented results of study DRT01 in 9 crFMF patients are supportive to the efficacy of canakinumab 
treatment in this periodic fever syndrome. The presented results of study D2204 are also positively supportive 
of the main efficacy results although the patient numbers are small (7 children). The results of study D2402 are 
supportive for the overall efficacy of canakinumab treatment in periodic fever syndromes and are clinically 
highly relevant for the affected patients. 20 patients with confirmed gene mutation indicative for TRAPS were 
enrolled into study D2203 and are regarded as representative for the indication. The primary objective was met. 
These results are clinically relevant in the target population and are supportive for the overall efficacy of 
canakinumab in the proposed new indication TRAPS. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Results from study N2301 show the superiority of canakinumab treatment compared to placebo treatment in the 
proposed indications crFMF, HIDS/MKD, and TRAPS. Laboratory parameters improved to normal levels, 
demonstrating reduction of inflammatory reaction. The efficacy of treatment sustained over a prolonged time 
even after withdrawal of study drug. Patients and physicians voted the disease activity as markedly reduced and 
health related quality of live parameters mostly also showed improvement. 
Assessment report  
EMA/26517/2017 
Page 40/60  
  
  
 
 
Results from the four supportive phase II pilot studies were consistent with the results from phase III study 
N2301. All four studies reached the primary endpoints and therefore demonstrated that canakinumab was able 
to reduce the disease attack rate, flare severity and normalized laboratory parameters of interest (CRP, SAA).  
The pivotal phase 3 study is still ongoing and will provide important information on long-term efficacy, and also 
importantly on the dosing in the long-term use. The so far limited long term data from the 2-year treatment in 
studies D2402 and D2203 is promising (majority of HIDS/MKD and TRAPS patients without re-flare) but needs 
further enrichment from upcoming data of period 4 of study N2301. The CHMP recommended that this data 
should be submitted post-approval. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The strategy for evaluation of safety in periodic fever syndromes is focussing on four different patient sets. 
Patients from study N2301 epoch 2 were pooled and include 181 patients in the three different diseases 
(63 crFMF patients, 72 HIDS/MKD patients, and 46 TRAPS patients) with a median duration of exposure of 113 
days and a cumulative exposure of 47.6 patient-years. This safety population reflects the safety results for each 
patient up to Week 16 (end of Epoch 2). 
The second, supportive pool presents data from study N2301 epochs 2-4 with a data cut off 25th August 2015 
with a duration of exposure to placebo (9.39 patient-years) much shorter than the duration of exposure to 
canakinumab (114.85 patient-years) since all data collected in Epochs 3 and 4 are counted within the 
canakinumab treatment group. 
The third pooled set is the CAPS data, already reflected in the SmPC.  
Finally the fourth group of additional descriptive safety data results from the four open label pilot studies that 
were not pooled. 
Overall, the presented patient numbers in this group of orphan indications are seen as representative although 
long term safety data are still lacking from study N2301 and will be presented after the end of epoch 4/study. 
Adverse events 
The adverse event profile of canakinumab treatment is overall mostly comparable in the new proposed 
indication with the approved CAPS indication. 
The most prominent adverse events were infections and infestations, pyrexia and headache. The most common 
infections are those of the upper respiratory tract. All infections were mild or moderate in severity.  
Injection site reactions seemed to occur more frequently in study N2301 groups compared to CAPS data. Apart 
from these injection site reactions, all other AEs were reported more frequently in the placebo population based 
on exposure adjusted event rates. It is noted that all patients in the pivotal phase 3 study N2301, comprising 
majority of the crFMF/ HIDS/ TRAPS patients, were treated with the new liquid in vial formulation of 
canakinumab while the approved lyophilized product was used in the CAPS-studies. Further analyses 
demonstrated that injection site reactions did not occur more in patients receiving liquid in vial than in those 
receiving lyophilized preparation, 12.4% vs. 15.9%, respectively. 
Infections and infestation, injection site reactions with the most reported AES possibly related to study 
treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/26517/2017 
Page 41/60  
  
  
 
 
The AE profiles observed in Study DTR01 and Study D2204 in crFMF patients, in Study D2402 in HIDS/MKD 
patients and in Study D2203 in TRAPS patients were consistent with the AE profile of the N2301 Phase 3 
population. AEs in the infections and infestations SOC were observed more commonly, mainly due to upper 
respiratory tract-related infections. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No deaths were reported in Study N2301 as of the data cut-off date (25-Aug-2015). No deaths were reported in 
the Phase 2 studies or in the CAPS pooled group. 
In the N2301 Epoch 2 crFMF cohort, the incidence of SAEs was low in the Any ACZ group (5 patients, 8.6%). No 
SAE was reported in more than 1 patient. The SAEs considered by the investigator to be possibly related to study 
drug were granulomatous liver disease, pharyngo-tonsillitis, and atypical pneumonia. In the N2301 Epoch 2 
HIDS/MKD cohort, the incidence of SAEs was 11.8% (8 patients) in the Any ACZ group. With the exception of 
pneumonia, reported in 2 patients in the placebo (Pbo) to 150 mg group, no SAE was reported in more than 1 
patient. One SAE, neutropenia, which occurred in a patient in the Pbo group, was considered by the investigator 
to be related to study drug. In the N2301 Epoch 2 TRAPS cohort, the incidence of SAEs was low, affecting 4.7% 
(2 patients) in the Any ACZ group. No SAE was reported in more than 1 patient. No SAE was considered by the 
investigator to be related to study drug. 
In Epochs 2-4, the incidence of SAEs in the Total ACZ group was 10.7% (18 patients). No SAE was reported in 
more than 1 patient in any particular cohort except umbilical hernia (2 patients (3.4%) in crFMF ACZ group) and 
pneumonia (3 patients (4.4%) in HIDS/MKD ACZ group). The SOC with the highest frequency of SAEs was 
infections and infestations (4.1% in the Total ACZ group). The exposure-adjusted SAE rate per 100 
patient-years was 30.5 in the Total ACZ group and 85.2 in the Total placebo group. 
No SAEs were reported during the treatment phase of crFMF Studies DTR01 or D2204. In HIDS/MKD Study 
D2402, a total of 14 SAEs were reported in 4 patients, none of which were considered by the investigator to be 
related to study treatment. In TRAPS Study D2203, 7 patients experienced an SAE during the treatment and 
follow-up periods, the most common of which was abdominal pain (2 patients). The profile of SAEs in the Phase 
2 studies in was similar to that observed in Study N2301. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Hematology data from patients in Study N2301 was in line with the known safety profile of canakinumab. 
Most of the newly occurring or worsening hematology abnormalities in Epoch 2 in the crFMF, HIDS/MKD, and 
TRAPS cohorts were CTCAE grade 1 or 2. Most of these hematology abnormalities were decreases in neutrophils, 
leukocytes and platelets in patients receiving canakinumab. One HIDS/MKD patient and 1 TRAPS patient had a 
grade 3 neutropenia, and 1 HIDS/MKD patient had a grade 3 thrombocytopenia. No patient had a grade 4 
hematology abnormality. The hematological profile in Epochs 2-4 was comparable to that of Epoch 2, with no 
additional grade 3 or 4 events in Epochs 3 or 4. 
Similar to what was observed in Study N2301 Epochs 2-4, most of the newly occurring or worsening hematology 
abnormalities in the CAPS pooled population were grade 1 or 2. However, the Total ACZ group showed a higher 
incidence of grade 1 reductions in platelets (Total ACZ: 27.8%, CAPS: 0.5%), grade 1 reductions in leukocytes 
(Total ACZ: 21.4%, CAPS: 4.2%), grade 1 reductions in neutrophils (Total ACZ: 13.7%, CAPS: 3.7%), and 
grade 2 reductions in neutrophils (Total ACZ: 7.1%, CAPS: 1.6%).

Clinical chemistry and urinalysis 
Patient clinical chemistry and urinalysis data from Study N2301 was in line with the known safety profile of 
canakinumab. No safety concerns were noted in any parameter. The clinical chemistry and urinalysis profile 
seen in Epochs 2-4 was comparable to that of Epoch 2. In all N2301 cohorts in Epoch 2 and in Epochs 2-4, all 
newly occurring or worsening notable post baseline abnormalities in biochemistry and urinalysis parameters 
were mild or CTCAE grade 1. In Epochs 2-4 in the Total ACZ group, 0 patients showed changes in creatinine 
clearance, gamma glutamyl transferase, cholesterol, or triglycerides. The most commonly observed change was 
a creatinine increase ≥ 25% from baseline, which occurred in 28.4% of patients. No patients in the Total ACZ 
group had a creatinine increase ≥ 3 times the ULN. Overall, clinical chemistry and urinalysis changes were 
comparable across the crFMF, HIDS/MKD, and TRAPS cohorts. Patients in the N2301 Epoch 2-4 group showed 
either a comparable number or fewer newly occurring or worsening notable post-baseline abnormalities in 
biochemistry and urinalysis parameters vs. the CAPS group. 
Abnormalities in biochemistry and urinalysis parameters are reflecting the currently known profile of 
canakinumab treatment with an even lower rate compared to the CAPS patients. 
Data on renal function were collected in the crFMF cohort. There were a small number of patients with 
improvement in kidney function.  
Results of vital signs observation are mostly unremarkable apart from25 canakinumab treated patients 
presenting with a decrease in pulse rate >20 compared to baseline.

Region: North America (US, Canada), Japan, Other 
Body weight: ≤ 40 kg, > 40 kg 
Cumulative N2301 dose level over 16 weeks: ≤ 600 mg, > 600 mg 
There seem to be also a slight tendency for increased rates of haematological changes and changes in creatinine 
levels with a higher cumulative dose. Adverse events with a substantially higher incidence in patients in the Total 
ACZ group with cumulative doses >600 mg compared with patients on doses ≤600 mg included: abdominal 
pain, arthralgia, cough, diarrhea, headache, injection site reaction, nasopharyngitis, oropharyngeal pain, 
pyrexia, rhinitis, and vomiting.  
The profile of AEs in each of these subgroups of intrinsic and extrinsic factors was consistent with that observed 
for the overall crFMF, HIDS/MKD, TRAPS, and CAPS populations 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No specific drug interaction studies were performed with canakinumab. No Canakinumab-immunosuppressants 
combination therapy toxicities were reported in Study N2301 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in Epoch 2 in the crFMF or TRAPS cohort. 
In Epoch 2, the incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation in the HIDS/MKD cohort was low, affecting 2.9% (2 
patients) in the Any ACZ group. The 2 AEs that led to discontinuation were HIDS flare (1 patient in the Pbo to 150 
mg q4w to 300 mg q4w group) and pericarditis (1 patient in the 150 mg q4w to 300 mg q4w group), which was 
not considered by the investigator to be related to study drug. 
In Epochs 2-4, 2 additional patients experienced an AE that led to discontinuation. These patients, one in the 
TRAPS ACZ group and one in the HIDS/MKD placebo group, had an AE of neutropenia. 
The rate of study discontinuations due to AEs is below 3%. 
Post marketing experience 
As reported in PSUR 12 (cut-off date 30 Jun 2015), the estimated cumulative exposure from marketing 
experience for canakinumab was approximately 7000 patient years. 
In terms of complete exposure, and taking into account subjects treated for all indications under all dose 
regimens, cumulatively >3400 subjects have been exposed to canakinumab in completed and reported clinical 
trials. This total represents a cumulative clinical trial exposure of just over 3140 patient-years for which safety 
data has been collected.  
This is a representative safety data base supporting the safe use of canakinumab in the different indications 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The assessment of the safety data primarily focuses on the data from study N2301 interim report of week 16 
primary endpoint analysis. Safety data of the CAPS studies were already assessed in various procedures and are 
well reflected in the SmPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/26517/2017 
Page 45/60  
  
  
 
 
Patient population was presented in four patient sets. Overall, the presented patient numbers in this group of 
rare indications are seen as representative although long term safety data are still lacking from study N2301 and 
will be presented after the end of epoch 4/study. 
The adverse event profile of canakinumab treatment is overall mostly comparable in the new proposed 
indication with the approved CAPS indication. 
The most prominent adverse events were infections and infestations, pyrexia and headache. The most common 
infections are those of the upper respiratory tract. All infections were mild or moderate in severity. Other 
observed adverse events that occur more frequently are diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Injection site reactions 
occur more frequently in study N2301 groups compared to CAPS data. Apart from these injection site reactions, 
all other AEs were reported more frequently in the placebo population based on exposure adjusted event rates. 
Infections and infestation, injection site reactions, and gastrointestinal disorders were the SOCs with the most 
reported AES possibly related to study treatment. 
It is noted that all patients in the pivotal phase 3 study N2301, comprising majority of the crFMF/ HIDS/ TRAPS 
patients, were treated with the new liquid in vial formulation of canakinumab while the approved lyophilized 
product was used in the CAPS-studies.  With further analyses the MAH was able to prove, that injection site 
reactions did not occur more in patients receiving liquid in vial than in those receiving lyophilized preparation, 
12.4% vs. 15.9%, respectively. 
No death occurred during the phase II and III studies. 
The rate of SAEs does not differ markedly from the already known safety profile of canakinumab. Observations 
from the phase II open label studies also support this.  
Results of the evaluation of haematology data shows that more patients have abnormalities in their platelet 
counts, neutrophil counts and leukocyte counts compared to placebo and also compared to the CAPS population. 
Most of the haematology abnormalities were CTC grade 1 or 2, 2 patients had a grade 3 neutropenia. Grade 1 
thrombocytopenia occurred in 27.8% of canakinumab treated patients compared to 4.1% in placebo patients. 
This is properly reflected in the SmPC (see section 4.8). Neutropenia is a known adverse drug reaction of 
canakinumab and should be monitored as described in the SmPC.  
According to PK/PD-modelling report, the occurrences leukopenia, neutropenia, or thrombopenia were not 
dependent on the serum ACZ885 concentration. The MAH has provided an analysis of the cases of 
thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and neutropenia – with the related AEs – in the crFMF/HIDS/TRAPS, and CAPS 
populations, as well as in the placebo group. There were no significant safety issues as the observed 
abnormalities were reversible and did not lead to dose reductions or withdrawals. This is reflected appropriately 
in the SmPC (see section 4.8).  
Abnormalities in biochemistry and urinalysis parameters are reflecting the currently known profile of 
canakinumab treatment with an even lower rate compared to the CAPS patients. 
Data on renal function were collected in the crFMF cohort. There were a small number of patients with 
improvement in kidney function. The patient numbers are however too small to draw definite conclusions. 
The presented subgroup analysis is not promoting any concerns regarding safety in special populations. The 
finding that female patients might have more adverse events when treated with canakinumab compared to 
males was already described in the original assessment for marketing authorisation and was also found in the 
gout population.  
Assessment report  
EMA/26517/2017 
Page 46/60  
  
  
 
 
There seem to be also a slight tendency for increased rates of haematological changes and changes in creatinine 
levels with a higher cumulative dose of canakinumab. Adverse events with a substantially higher incidence in 
patients in the Total ACZ group with cumulative doses >600 mg compared with patients on doses ≤600 mg 
included abdominal pain, arthralgia, cough, diarrhoea, headache, injection site reaction, nasopharyngitis, 
oropharyngeal pain, pyrexia, rhinitis, and vomiting. Patterns were similar to the overall population. However, 
these findings are all limited by the relatively lower patient numbers in the different cohorts and the fact that the 
patient characteristics were presumably different in the two dose groups, and are therefore no final conclusion 
can be made. Sub-grouping the patients by age, race, and weight did not display clinically significant differences 
on the types or incidences of the AEs.  
Immunogenicity data generated from study N2301 shows that no patient had neutralizing antibodies. Two 
patients in the phase II studies had treatment emergent ADA with emerging AE or loss of efficacy or changes in 
PK. Therefore, immunogenicity is not a concern of canakinumab treatment in the proposed indications. 
The rate of study discontinuations due to AEs is below 3%.  
As already mentioned data on long term use of canakinumab in the respective proposed indications is still rather 
limited and needs to be increased. Further data will be available after finishing of study N2301.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been 
included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Treatment with canakinumab in the three proposed new indications of crFMF, HIDS/MKD, and TRAPS was 
associated with the occurrence of a wide variety of adverse events and serious adverse events. The most 
common were infections and infestations; neutropenia and events associated with the underlying disease as well 
as injections site reactions. Most of the events were of mild to moderate severity. No death was reported. The 
safety profile of canakinumab did not differ markedly from the already known and described profile in the 
already approved indications. 
Long term safety data is still very limited in these indications but more data will become available with 
completion of study N2301. 
In conclusion, the safety profile of canakinumab in the treatment of crFMF, HIDS/MKD, and TRAPS does not 
preclude the authorization of Ilaris in these indications. The clinical safety data submitted in support of this 
application was considerd acceptable.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Tumour necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) 
Ilaris is indicated for the treatment of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated periodic syndrome 
(TRAPS). 
Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS)/mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD) 
Ilaris is indicated for the treatment of hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS)/mevalonate kinase deficiency 
(MKD). 
Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) 
Ilaris is indicated for the treatment of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). Ilaris should be given in combination 
with colchicine, if appropriate. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
To date, there are no approved therapies for HIDS/MKD or TRAPS. Certain medications have been used to treat 
the symptoms of these periodic fever syndromes, but these provide limited control over the relapsing febrile 
attacks and none treat the underlying inflammation.  
For patients with FMF, colchicine has shown to be effective in controlling febrile attacks and preventing 
secondary amyloidosis in the majority of these patients. However, colchicine is not universally approved for the 
treatment of FMF and is associated with the significant side effects and patients who do not respond to or are 
intolerant to colchicine have very few, if any, treatment options. 
Thus, there is an unmet medical need for a therapy that provides both relief of fever and symptoms as well as 
effective disease control. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Canakinumab treatment was evaluated in the described periodic fever syndromes in four uncontrolled phase II 
pilot studies and one Phase 3 study CACZ885N2301 in a total of 226 patients, which evaluated the efficacy and 
safety of canakinumab at a starting dose of 150 mg sc or 2 mg/kg for patients weighing ≤ 40 kg administered 
every 4 weeks (q4w) in patients with FMF, HIDS/MKD, or TRAPS compared to placebo. 
Assessment report  
EMA/26517/2017 
Page 52/60  
  
  
 
 
Study N2301 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study of canakinumab in patients with 
Hereditary Periodic Fevers (TRAPS, HIDS, or crFMF), with subsequent randomized withdrawal/dosing frequency 
reduction and open-label long term treatment epochs. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Study N2301 achieved the primary objective and showed that Canakinumab was superior to placebo in all 3 
disease cohorts with respect to the proportion of patients who had resolution of their index flare by Day 15 and 
did not experience a new flare during the remainder of Epoch 2. The proportion of patients who achieved a 
complete response in Epoch 2 was: 
- 
- 
- 
61.3% for canakinumab vs. 6.3% for placebo in crFMF patients (OR=23.75, p<0.0001), 
35.1% vs. 5.7% in HIDS/MKD patients (OR=8.94, p=0.002), and 
45.5% vs. 8.3% (OR=9.17, p=0.005) in TRAPS patients. 
More patients achieved a complete response with canakinumab than with placebo, regardless of age, prior use 
of biologics and concomitant use of colchicine (for crFMF).  
Furthermore, sustained flare control was seen over 16 weeks of treatment. Among canakinumab-treated 
patients (150 mg or 300 mg q4w), 90.3%, 64.9% and 77.3% of crFMF, HIDS/MKD and TRAPS patients, 
respectively, had no new flare (i.e., PGA ≥ 2 and CRP ≥ 30 mg/L) after resolution of the index flare up to the end 
of Week 16. 
Secondary efficacy results show that canakinumab was superior to placebo in the secondary endpoints of PGA < 
2 and CRP ≤ 10 mg/L at Week 16 in crFMF, HIDS/MKD and TRAPS cohorts. For the secondary endpoint SAA ≤ 
10 mg/L at Week 16, canakinumab showed greater improvements in all disease cohorts but only with a 
statistically significant difference for TRAPS patients. 
The results of the secondary and exploratory efficacy analysis support the results of the primary endpoint. It is 
shown that treatment with canakinumab is able to normalize the CRP levels in all three disease cohorts in a 
statistically significant way in comparison to placebo. These results are regarded as clinically meaningful 
improvement of disease status after 3 month of treatment. 
All presented subgroup analyses are supportive to the primary and secondary analysis. Due to the partly very 
small cohorts of patients, the possibility to draw conclusions is limited. Subgroup analyses with regard to age, 
prior use of biological therapy and concomitant use of colchicine do not show any clear signals of reduced or 
improved efficacy. 
Four uncontrolled open label studies (DTR01and D2204 in crFMF, D2402 in HIDS/MKD, D2203 in TRAPS) 
contributed further supportive efficacy data in the target population of periodic fever syndromes (45 patients). 
Efficacy measurements were made relative to baseline values. The results of these pilot studies fully support the 
efficacy seen in the phase III study. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Due to the rarity of the condition, the data of patients not using prior/ concomitant colchicine in the treatment 
of FMF are too limited to draw any firm conclusions on the efficacy of canakinumab in this FMF subpopulation.  
The data of long-term efficacy of canakinumab in treatment of crFMF, HIDS and TRAPS are rather limited, and 
therefore the results of the 24-week withdrawal and the 72-week long-term treatment periods of the currently 
Assessment report  
EMA/26517/2017 
Page 53/60  
  
  
 
 
ongoing  pivotal  study  N2301  should  be  provided  as  a  post-approval  measure  as  soon  as  the  results  are 
available. 
No  formal  dose-finding  studies  were  conducted  due  to  rarity  of  the  applied  indications.  Further  data  on 
maintenance dosing will become available from the study N2301. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The adverse event profile of canakinumab treatment is overall mostly comparable in the new proposed 
indication with the approved CAPS indication.  
The most prominent adverse events were infections and infestations, pyrexia and headache. The most common 
infections are those of the upper respiratory tract. Infections and infestation, and injection site reactions, were 
the SOCs with the most reported AEs possibly related to study treatment. 
The rate of SAEs does not differ markedly from the already known safety profile of canakinumab. Observations 
from the phase II open label studies also support this. Results of the evaluation of haematology data shows that 
more patients have abnormalities in their platelet counts, neutrophil counts and leukocyte counts compared to 
placebo and also compared to the CAPS population. Most of the haematology abnormalities were CTC grade 1 or 
2, 2 patients had a grade 3 neutropenia. Grade 1 thrombocytopenia occurred in 15.9% of canakinumab treated 
patients (compared to 4.1% in placebo patients).  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
According to PK/PD modeling report, the occurrences of leukopenia, neutropenia, and lymphopenia were not 
dependent on the serum ACZ885 concentration. The study included the option for dose escalation in case the 
index flare did not resolve by day 15. This escape option had to be used by 16% of crFMF patients, 32% of 
HIDS/MKD patients, and 36% of TRAPS patients treated with canakinumab compared to 62.5% of crFMF 
patients, 63% of HIDS/MKD patients, and 75% of TRAPS patients treated with placebo. However, this option 
enabled especially crFMF and TRAPS patients to reach resolution of index flare by day 29. One third of the 
patients (n= 25) had to escalate the dose to 300mg or 4mg/kg in patients >40kg bw due to not optimal efficacy. 
This higher cumulative dose might lead to an increased amount of adverse events. There seems to be also a 
slight tendency for increased rates of haematological changes and changes in creatinine levels with a higher 
cumulative dose of canakinumab. A higher percentage of Total ACZ patients in the >600 mg group showed a 
≥25% increase from baseline in creatinine (36.4%) compared with the ≤ 600 mg group (24.6%). However, the 
serum creatinine values remained within the normal range.  Adverse events with a substantially higher incidence 
in patients in the Total ACZ group with cumulative doses >600 mg compared with patients on doses ≤600 mg 
until 16 weeks included abdominal pain, arthralgia, cough, diarrhoea, headache, injection site reaction, 
nasopharyngitis, oropharyngeal pain, pyrexia, rhinitis, and vomiting. Dose dependence on these adverse events 
cannot be ruled out completely.  
Subgroup analysis showed that female patients might have more adverse events (85.0% in females vs. 73.9% 
in males) when treated with canakinumab compared to males. This was already described in the original 
assessment for marketing authorisation and was also found in the gout population.  
Data on long term use of canakinumab in the respective proposed indications is still rather limited and needs to 
be increased. Further data will be available after finishing of study N2301.

3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Canakinumab treatment is superior compared to placebo treatment in the proposed indications crFMF, 
HIDS/MKD, and TRAPS. The onset of response in all three cohorts was within a few days. Laboratory parameters 
improved to normal levels, demonstrating reduction of inflammatory reaction. The efficacy of treatment 
sustained over a prolonged time even after withdrawal of study drug. Patients and physicians assessed the 
disease activity as markedly reduced and health related quality of life parameters were also mostly improved. 
16-30% of patients in the different cohorts required up-titration of the dose. With the higher dose regimen, 
further efficacy was attained. This flexible dosing option provides a useful tool for treating physicians. However, 
this might result in a higher cumulative dose which could possibly be associated with an increase in adverse 
events and serious adverse events. 
Canakinumab’s ability to reduce the disease attack rate, flare severity and normalized laboratory parameters of 
interest (CRP, SAA) is regarded as medically highly important. The currently limited long term data from the 
2-year treatment in studies D2402 and D2203 is promising (majority of HIDS/MKD and TRAPS patients without 
re-flare) but not yet conclusive. 
The most common adverse events were infections and infestations, neutropenia and events associated with the 
underlying disease as well as injections site reactions.  
No deaths were reported. The safety profile of canakinumab did not differ markedly from the already known and 
described profile in the approved indications. 
An increase in frequency can be seen for Grad 1 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. However, this is properly 
addressed in the SmPC.  
Long term safety data is still very limited in these indications but more data will become available with 
completion of study N2301. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Canakinumab was able to demonstrate a clinically meaningful benefit in the proposed three indications in a 
double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 confirmatory study as well as in four supportive phase II 
pilot studies. There were no new safety findings in the canakinumab –treated crFMF, HIDS/MKD and TRAPS 
patients, and the safety profile in the 3 indications were mostly comparable to the approved indication of CAPS.  
Canakinumab at the proposed dosing regimen is regarded as an effective and safe treatment for the intended 
population who is in need for further treatment options and also for patients with an inadequate response to 
current therapies. 
With regard to one of the proposed three new indications, colchicine resistant FMF, there is data only on a few 
patients without concomitant colchicine use, i.e. patients with contraindication or intolerance to colchicine. 
Further, colchicine has a marketing authorization for the treatment of FMF only in 5 member States of the EU 
(Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Slovakia, and United Kingdom). Prevalence of this disease is highest among 
subjects originating from Eastern Mediterranean area, but today these patients may appear in other areas. 
It is noteworthy, however, that canakinumab has been already licensed for the “symptomatic treatment of adult 
patients with frequent gouty arthritis attacks (at least 3 attacks in the previous 12 months) in whom 
Assessment report  
EMA/26517/2017 
Page 55/60  
  
  
 
 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and colchicine are contraindicated, are not tolerated, or do not 
provide an adequate response, and in whom repeated courses of corticosteroids are not appropriate (see section 
5.1).”, even though colchicine has not been licensed for  the treatment of gout in all MSs either (colchicine has 
been licensed for gout-indication in 19 MSs, according to the Art 57 database). 
Overall, the MAH was requested to explore the possibility of extrapolating the crFMF-indication to all 
FMF-patients regardless of the prior/ concomitant use of colchicine. According to the MAH, the data of the 
patients without concomitant or prior use of colchicine is too limited for reliable extrapolation of the effect of 
canakinumab in this FMF sub-population. It is however acknowledged that there is clinical need for the 
treatment of FMF in these relatively rare patients with contraindication, intolerance or insufficient response to 
colchicine, or in colchicine naïve patients who do not have access to colchicine therapy (as colchicine is not 
licenced for the treatment of FMF in many Member States). The only uncertainty related to the use of 
canakinumab alone/ at first line treatment is related to the fact that colchicine has been suggested to prevent 
secondary amyloidosis in these patients “by suppressing chronic inflammatory activity” (EULAR 
recommendations for the management of familial Mediterranean fever Ann Rheum Dis 2016;0:1-8: "Colchicine 
should be co-administered with alternative biological therapies given that it may reduce the risk of amyloidosis 
despite persistence of attacks".) and therefore these patients should be treated with colchicine, if available. 
Also, there is strong biological plausibility that canakinumab would have similar effect in the treatment of FMF 
without colchicine. Finally, the treatment of FMF will be usually carried out by specialists, often in special 
centers, and therefore it is also feasible and appropriate to leave some flexibility to the indication, i.e. for the 
treating physician to decide. 
Taking into account all the above-mentioned aspects, the indication is changed as follows to cover all FMF 
patients with a potential to benefit from canakinumab treatment:  
Ilaris is indicated for the treatment of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). Ilaris should be given in combination 
with colchicine, if appropriate. 
The benefit-risk balance for Canakinumab in the treatment of crFMF, HIDS/MKD, and TRAPS is positive, 
provided that sufficient long term efficacy and safety data will be collected and the final study report of study 
N2301 will be submitted. 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit-risk of Ilaris is positive.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality and safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers that the risk-benefit 
balance of the line extension for ILARIS, to add the new pharmaceutical form 150 mg/ml solution for injection, 
is favourable in the following indication: 
Periodic fever syndromes 
Ilaris is indicated for the treatment of the following autoinflammatory periodic fever syndromes in adults, 
adolescents and children aged 2 years and older: 
Assessment report  
EMA/26517/2017 
Page 56/60  
  
  
 
 
 
 
Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes 
Ilaris is indicated for the treatment of cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) including: 
•  Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), 
• 
Neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID) / chronic infantile neurological, cutaneous, 
articular syndrome (CINCA), 
• 
Severe forms of familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) / familial cold urticaria (FCU) presenting 
with signs and symptoms beyond cold-induced urticarial skin rash. 
Tumour necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) 
Ilaris is indicated for the treatment of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated periodic syndrome 
(TRAPS). 
Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS)/mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD) 
Ilaris is indicated for the treatment of hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS)/mevalonate kinase deficiency 
(MKD). 
Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) 
Ilaris is indicated for the treatment of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). Ilaris should be given in combination 
with colchicine, if appropriate. 
Ilaris is also indicated for the treatment of: 
Still’s disease 
Ilaris is indicated for the treatment of active Still’s disease including adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD) and 
systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) in patients aged 2 years and older who have responded inadequately 
to previous therapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and systemic corticosteroids. Ilaris 
can be given as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate. 
Gouty arthritis 
Ilaris is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of adult patients with frequent gouty arthritis attacks (at least 
3 attacks in the previous 12 months) in whom non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and colchicine 
are contraindicated, are not tolerated, or do not provide an adequate response, and in whom repeated courses 
of corticosteroids are not appropriate. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension of the marketing authorisation for ILARIS subject to the 
following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product Characteristics, 
section 4.2). 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the  agreed RMP 
Assessment report  
EMA/26517/2017 
Page 57/60  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important 
(pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) shall ensure that, prior to launch, all physicians who are expected to 
prescribe/use Ilaris are provided with a physician information pack containing the following: 
•  The Summary of Product Characteristics 
•  Healthcare professional information 
•  Patient Reminder Card 
The Healthcare Professional information should contain the following key messages: 
•  The risk of serious infections, including opportunistic bacterial, viral and fungal infections in patients 
treated with Ilaris; 
•  For CAPS, TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, FMF and SJIA patients: the need to instruct patients on proper techniques 
for self-administration when the patient is willing and capable to do so, and guidance for Health Care 
Professionals on how to report administration errors; 
•  The identified or potential risk of immunogenicity that might lead to immune-mediated symptoms. For 
gouty arthritis patients: highlighting that intermittent therapy or re-exposure after a long 
treatment-free interval may be associated with an enhanced immune response (or loss of immune 
tolerance) to Ilaris and thus re-treated patients must be considered at risk of hypersensitivity reactions; 
•  For chronic therapy in CAPS: the need for Health Care Professionals to perform an annual clinical 
assessment of patients regarding a potential increased risk for the development of malignancies; 
•  As treatment with Ilaris should not be initiated in patients with neutropenia, the need to measure 
neutrophil counts prior to initiating treatment and again after 1 to 2 months. For chronic therapy in 
CAPS patients or repeated therapy in gouty arthritis patients, it is recommended to assess neutrophil 
counts periodically during treatment; 
•  For SJIA patients, the need for Health Care Professionals to be attentive to symptoms of infection or 
worsening of SJIA, as these are known triggers for macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) which is a 
known, life-threatening disorder that may develop in patients with rheumatic conditions, in particular 
SJIA patients. If MAS occurs, or is suspected, evaluation and treatment should be started as early as 
possible; 
•  The need to monitor patients for changes in their lipid profiles; 
•  The unknown safety of Ilaris in pregnant and lactating women, thus the need for physicians to discuss this 
risk with patients if they become or plan to become pregnant; 
•  The proper patient management as regards the interaction with vaccination; 
•  Where relevant, the possibility to include patients in the registry study to facilitate the collection of long 
term efficacy and safety data; 
•  The role and use of Patient Reminder Card.

Specific Obligation to complete post-authorisation measures for the marketing authorisation under 
exceptional circumstances 
This being an approval under exceptional circumstances and pursuant to Article 14(8) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004, the MAH shall conduct, within the stated timeframe, the following measures: 
Area 
Clinical 
SO 1 
Due date 
Annually 
within the 
annual 
re-assessment 
Description 
The MAH is requested to provide reports on the ß-Confident 
registry (CACZ885D2401), which was designed to provide data 
on long-term safety and effectiveness of Ilaris treatment in 
paediatric and adult CAPS patients in routine clinical practice. In 
these reports the MAH is requested to specifically assess cases 
for whom there is a loss of efficacy (patients reported to have 
discontinued Ilaris for lack-of-therapeutic response) to 
determine whether this is due to changes over time in PK/PD or 
antibody development (where data is available) or in whom a 
dose adjustment has led to improved therapeutic response 
(patients with a dose up titration without discontinuation for 
lack-of-therapeutic response). 
The MAH is required to provide updates on the recruitment rates 
and any intermediary results annually within the annual 
re-assessment. 
The patients should be included in the Registry until both 
following conditions are met: 5 years recruitment period and 
200 patients included. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product to be 
implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
These conditions fully reflect the advice received from the PRAC.  
In addition, CHMP recommends the variation(s) to the terms of the marketing authorisation, concerning the 
following change(s): 
Variation(s) requested 
Type 
C.I.6.a 
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new

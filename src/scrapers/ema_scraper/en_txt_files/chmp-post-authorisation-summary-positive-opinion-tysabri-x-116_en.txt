Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Tysabri 
natalizumab 
On  28  January  2021,  the  Committee  for  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use  (CHMP)  adopted  a  positive 
opinion  recommending  a  change  to  the  terms  of  the  marketing  authorisation  for  the  medicinal  product 
Tysabri. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Biogen Netherlands B.V. 
The CHMP recommended the addition of a new strength (150 mg), a new pharmaceutical form (solution for 
injection) and a new route of administration (subcutaneous use) for, Tysabri, a multiple sclerosis medicine 
already  authorised  for  intravenous  use.  The  recommended  indication  for  Tysabri  150 mg  solution  for 
injection use (subcutaneous) is the same as the currently authorised indication for Tysabri concentration 
for solution for infusion. 
Treatment with Tysabri is to be initiated and continuously supervised by specialised physicians experienced 
in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological conditions, with timely access to MRI. Home treatment is 
not recommended. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report (EPAR) 
and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to the marketing 
authorisation has been granted by the European Commission. 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be issued 67 
days from adoption of the opinion

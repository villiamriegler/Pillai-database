prophylaxis of bleeding in children below 12 years of 
age with haemophilia B including previously 
untreated patients for Refixia based on results from 
studies NN7999-3774 and NN7999-3895. NN7999-
3774 is a multicentre, open-label, non-controlled 
0032’ 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

study evaluating the safety, efficacy and 
pharmacokinetics of nonacog beta pegol in 
previously treated children with haemophilia B, while 
NN7999-3895 is a multicentre, open-label, single-
arm, non-controlled trial evaluating the safety and 
efficacy of nonacog beta pegol in previously 
untreated patients with haemophilia B. As a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 
and 5.3 of the SmPC are updated. The Package 
Leaflet is updated accordingly. Version 5.2 of the 
RMP has also been submitted. In addition, the MAH 
took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial 
changes to the PI. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary 
of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

SmPC, Annex 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
II, Labelling 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
and PL 
Refixia in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Nelarabine is indicated for the treatment of patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia 
(T-ALL) and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) whose disease has not responded to or has 
relapsed following treatment with at least two chemotherapy regimens. 
Due to the small patient populations in these disease settings, the information to support these 
indications is based on limited data. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Nelarabine must only be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of 
cytotoxic agents. 
Posology 
Complete blood counts including platelets must be monitored regularly (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Adults and adolescents (aged 16 years and older) 
The recommended dose of nelarabine for adults and adolescents aged 16 years and older is 
1,500 mg/m2 administered intravenously over two hours on days 1, 3 and 5 and repeated every 
21 days. 
Children and adolescents (aged 21 years and younger) 
The recommended dose of nelarabine for children and adolescents (aged 21 years and younger) is 
650 mg/m2 administered intravenously over one hour daily for 5 consecutive days, repeated every 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
21 days. 
In clinical studies, the 650 mg/m2 and 1,500 mg/m2 dose have both been used in patients in the age 
range 16 to 21 years. Efficacy and safety were similar for both regimens. The prescribing physician 
should consider which regimen is appropriate when treating patients in this age range. 
Limited clinical pharmacology data are available for patients below the age of 4 years (see 
section 5.2). 
Dose modification 
Nelarabine must be discontinued at the first sign of neurological events of National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Event (NCI CTCAE) grade 2 or greater. Delaying subsequent 
dosing is an option for other toxicities, including haematological toxicity. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
Insufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years of age and older have been treated with nelarabine to 
determine whether they respond differently than younger patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
Nelarabine has not been studied in individuals with renal impairment. Nelarabine and 9-β-D-
arabinofuranosylguanine (ara-G) are partially renally excreted (see section 5.2). There are insufficient 
data to support a dose adjustment recommendation for patients with a renal clearance of creatinine Clcr 
less than 50 ml/min. Patients with renal impairment must be closely monitored for toxicities when 
treated with nelarabine. 
Hepatic impairment 
Nelarabine has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. These patients should be treated 
with caution. 
Method of administration 
Nelarabine is for intravenous use only and must not be diluted prior to administration. The appropriate 
dose of nelarabine must be transferred into polyvinylchloride (PVC) or ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA) 
infusion bags or glass containers and administered intravenously as a two-hour infusion in adult 
patients and as a one-hour infusion in paediatric patients. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
NEUROLOGICAL ADVERSE REACTIONS 
Severe neurological reactions have been reported with the use of nelarabine. These reactions have 
included altered mental states including severe somnolence, confusion and coma, central nervous 
system effects including convulsions, ataxia and status epilepticus, and peripheral neuropathy 
including hypoesthesia ranging from numbness and paresthesias to motor weakness and paralysis. 
There have also been reports of reactions associated with demyelination, and ascending peripheral 
neuropathies similar in appearance to Guillain-Barré Syndrome. (see section 4.8). 
Neurotoxicity is the dose-limiting toxicity of nelarabine. Full recovery from these reactions has not 
always occurred with cessation of nelarabine. Therefore, close monitoring for neurological reactions 
is strongly recommended, and nelarabine must be discontinued at the first sign of neurological 
reactions of NCI CTCAE Grade 2 or greater. 
Patients treated previously or concurrently with intrathecal chemotherapy or previously with 
craniospinal irradiation are potentially at increased risk for neurological adverse events (see 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
section 4.2 - dose modification) and therefore concomitant intrathecal therapy and/or craniospinal 
irradiation is not recommended. 
Immunisation using a live organism vaccine has the potential to cause infection in 
immunocompromised hosts. Therefore, immunisations with live organism vaccines are not 
recommended. 
Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, and neutropenia, (including febrile neutropenia) have been 
associated with nelarabine therapy. Complete blood counts including platelets must be monitored 
regularly (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Patients receiving nelarabine are recommended to receive intravenous hydration according to standard 
medical practice for the management of hyperuricaemia in patients at risk of tumour lysis syndrome. 
For patients at risk of hyperuricaemia, the use of allopurinol should be considered. 
Elderly 
Clinical studies of nelarabine did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to 
determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. In an exploratory analysis, 
increasing age, especially age 65 years and older, appeared to be associated with increased rates of 
neurological adverse events. 
Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity 
Carcinogenicity testing of nelarabine has not been performed. Nelarabine however, is known to be 
genotoxic to mammalian cells (see section 5.3). 
Sodium warning 
This medicinal product contains 88.51 mg (3.85 mmol) sodium per vial (50 ml), equivalent to 4.4% of 
the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Nelarabine and ara-G did not significantly inhibit the activities of the major hepatic cytochrome P450 
(CYP) isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or 
CYP3A4 in vitro. 
Concomitant administration of nelarabine in combination with adenosine deaminase inhibitors such as 
pentostatin is not recommended. Concomitant administration may reduce the efficacy of nelarabine 
and/or change the adverse event profile of either active substance. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Contraception in males and females 
Both sexually active men and women should use effective methods of contraception during treatment 
with nelarabine. Men with partners who are pregnant or could become pregnant should use condoms 
during treatment with nelarabine and for at least three months following cessation of treatment. 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of nelarabine in pregnant women. 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk in humans is 
unknown, however, exposure during pregnancy will likely lead to anomalies and malformations of the 
foetus. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nelarabine should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. If a patient becomes 
pregnant during treatment with nelarabine, they should be informed of the possible risk to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether nelarabine or its metabolites are excreted in human breast milk. A risk to the 
newborn/infant cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with 
Atriance. 
Fertility 
The effect of nelarabine on fertility in humans is unknown. Based on the pharmacological action of the 
compound, undesirable effects on fertility are possible. Family planning should be discussed with 
patients as appropriate. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Atriance has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Patients treated with nelarabine are potentially at risk of suffering from somnolence during and for 
several days after treatment. Patients must be cautioned that somnolence can affect performance of 
skilled tasks, such as driving. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety profile from pivotal clinical studies at the recommended doses of nelarabine in adults 
(1,500 mg/m2) and children (650 mg/m2) is based on data from 103 adults and 84 paediatric patients 
respectively. The most frequently occurring adverse events were fatigue; gastrointestinal disorders; 
haematological disorders; respiratory disorders; nervous system disorders (somnolence, peripheral 
neurological disorders [sensory and motor], dizziness, hypoaesthesia, paraesthesia, headache); and 
pyrexia. Neurotoxicity is the dose-limiting toxicity associated with nelarabine therapy (see 
section 4.4).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Infection and infestations 
There was a single additional report of biopsy confirmed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
in the adult population. 
There have been reports of sometimes fatal opportunistic infections in patients receiving nelarabine 
therapy. 
Nervous system disorders 
There have been reports of events associated with demyelination and ascending peripheral 
neuropathies similar in appearance to Guillain-Barré syndrome. 
Two paediatric patients had fatal neurological events. 
Data from NCI studies/compassionate use programme and phase I studies 
In addition to the adverse reactions seen in the pivotal clinical studies, there are also data from 
875 patients from NCI studies/compassionate use programme (694 patients) and Phase I (181 patients) 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
studies of nelarabine. The following additional adverse reactions were seen: 
Neoplasms benign and malignant (including cysts and polyps) 
Tumour lysis syndrome – 7 cases (see sections 4.2 and 4.4) 
Post–marketing data 
Rhabdomyolysis and increased blood creatine phosphokinase have been identified during post-
approval use of nelarabine. This includes spontaneous case reports as well as serious adverse events 
from ongoing studies. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
No case of overdose has been reported. 
Nelarabine has been administered in clinical studies up to a dose of 75 mg/kg (approximately 
2,250 mg/m2) daily for 5 days to a paediatric patient, up to a dose of 60 mg/kg (approximately 
2,400 mg/m2) daily for 5 days to 5 adult patients and up to 2,900 mg/m2 in a further 2 adults on days 1, 
3 and 5. 
Symptoms and signs 
It is likely that nelarabine overdose would result in severe neurotoxicity (possibly including paralysis, 
coma), myelosuppression and potentially death. At a dose of 2200 mg/m2 given on days 1, 3 and 
5 every 21 days, 2 patients developed a significant grade 3 ascending sensory neuropathy. MRI 
evaluations of the 2 patients demonstrated findings consistent with a demyelinating process in the 
cervical spine. 
Treatment 
There is no known antidote for nelarabine overdose. Supportive care consistent with good clinical 
practice should be provided.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, antimetabolites, purine analogues, ATC code: 
L01B B 07 
Nelarabine is a pro-drug of the deoxyguanosine analogue ara-G. Nelarabine is rapidly demethylated by 
adenosine deaminase (ADA) to ara-G and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxyguanosine 
kinase and deoxycytidine kinase to its 5’-monophosphate metabolite. The monophosphate metabolite 
is subsequently converted to the active 5’-triphosphate form, ara-GTP. Accumulation of ara-GTP in 
leukaemic blasts allows for preferential incorporation of ara-GTP into deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) 
leading to inhibition of DNA synthesis. This results in cell death. Other mechanisms may contribute to 
the cytotoxic effects of nelarabine. In vitro, T-cells are more sensitive than B-cells to the cytotoxic 
effects of nelarabine.

Clinical efficacy and data 
Adult clinical study in relapsed or refractory T-ALL and T-LBL 
In an open-label study carried out by the Cancer and Leukaemia Group B and the Southwest Oncology 
Group, the safety and efficacy of nelarabine were evaluated in 39 adults with T-cell acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) or lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL). Twenty–eight of the 
39 adults had relapsed or were refractory to at least two prior induction regimens and aged between 16 
to 65 years of age (mean 34 years). Nelarabine at a dose of 1500 mg/m2/day was administered 
intravenously over two hours on days 1, 3 and 5 of a 21 day cycle. Five of the 28 patients (18 %) 
[95 % CI: 6 %—37 %] treated with nelarabine achieved a complete response (bone marrow blast 
counts ≤ 5 %, no other evidence of disease, and full recovery of peripheral blood counts). A total of 
6 patients (21 %) [95 % CI: 8 %–41 %] achieved a complete response with or without haematological 
recovery. Time to complete response in both classifications of response ranged from 2.9 to 
11.7 weeks. Duration of response (in both classifications of response (n=5) ranged between 15 and 
195+ weeks. Median overall survival was 20.6 weeks [95 % CI: 10.4–36.4]. Survival at one year was 
29 % [95 % CI: 12 %–45 %]. 
Paediatric clinical study in relapsed or refractory T-ALL and T-LBL 
In an open-label, multicenter study carried out by Childrens Oncology Group, nelarabine was 
administered intravenously over 1 hour for 5 days to 151 patients ≤ 21 years of age, 149 of whom had 
relapsed or refractory T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) or T-cell lymphoblastic 
lymphoma (T-LBL). Eighty-four (84) patients, 39 of whom had received two or more prior induction 
regimens and 31 whom had received one prior induction regimen, were treated with 650 mg/m2/day of 
nelarabine administered intravenously over 1 hour daily for 5 consecutive days repeated every 
21 days. 
Of the 39 patients who had received two or more prior induction regimens, 5 (13 %) [95 % CI: 4 %–
27 %] achieved a complete response (bone marrow blast counts ≤ 5 %, no other evidence of disease, 
and full recovery of peripheral blood counts) and 9 (23 %) [95 % CI: 11 %–39 %] achieved complete 
responses with or without full haematological recovery. Duration of response in both classifications of 
response ranged between 4.7 and 36.4 weeks and median overall survival was 13.1 weeks [95 % CI: 
8.7–17.4] and survival at one year was 14 % [95 % CI: 3 %–26 %]. 
Thirteen (42 %) of the 31 patients treated with one prior induction regimen achieved a complete 
response overall. Nine of these 31 patients failed to respond to prior induction (refractory patients). 
Four (44 %) of the nine refractory patients experienced a complete response to nelarabine. 
This medicinal product has been authorised under “exceptional circumstances”. This means that due to 
the rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal 
product. 
The European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become available every 
year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Nelarabine is a pro-drug of the deoxyguanosine analogue ara-G. Nelarabine is rapidly demethylated by 
adenosine deaminase (ADA) to ara-G and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxyguanosine 
kinase and deoxycytidine kinase to its 5’-monophosphate metabolite. The monophosphate metabolite 
is subsequently converted to the active 5’-triphosphate from, ara-GTP. Accumulation of ara-GTP in 
leukaemic blasts allows for preferential incorporation of ara-GTP into deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) 
leading to inhibition of DNA synthesis. This results in cell death. Other mechanisms may contribute to 
the cytotoxic effects of nelarabine. In vitro, T-cells are more sensitive than B-cells to the cytotoxic 
effects of nelarabine. 
In a cross-study analysis using data from four Phase I studies, the pharmacokinetics of nelarabine and 
ara-G were characterized in patients aged less than 18 years and adult patients with refractory 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
leukaemia or lymphoma. 
Absorption 
Adults 
Plasma ara-G Cmax values generally occurred at the end of the nelarabine infusion and were generally 
higher than nelarabine Cmax values, suggesting rapid and extensive conversion of nelarabine to ara-G. 
After infusion of 1,500 mg/m2 nelarabine over two hours in adult patients, mean (%CV) plasma 
nelarabine Cmax and AUCinf values were 13.9 µM (81 %) and 13.5 µM.h (56 %) respectively. Mean 
plasma ara-G Cmax and AUCinf values were 115 µM (16 %) and 571 µM.h (30 %), respectively. 
Intracellular Cmax for ara-GTP appeared within 3 to 25 hours on day 1. Mean (%CV) intracellular ara-
GTP Cmax and AUC values were 95.6 µM (139 %) and 2214 µM.h (263 %) at this dose. 
Paediatric patients 
After infusion of 400 or 650 mg/m2 nelarabine over one hour in 6 paediatric patients, mean (%CV) 
plasma nelarabine Cmax and AUCinf values, adjusted to a 650 mg/m2 dose, were 45.0 µM (40 %) and 
38.0 µM.h (39 %), respectively. Mean plasma ara-G Cmax and AUCinf values were 60.1 µM (17 %) and 
212 µM.h (18 %), respectively. 
Distribution 
Nelarabine and ara-G are extensively distributed throughout the body based on combined Phase I 
pharmacokinetic data at nelarabine doses of 104 to 2,900 mg/m2. Specifically, for nelarabine, mean 
(%CV) VSS values were 115 l/m2 (159 %) and 89.4 l/m2 (278 %) in adult and paediatric patients, 
respectively. For ara-G, mean VSS/F values were 44.8 l/m2 (32 %) and 32.1 l/m2 (25 %) in adult and 
paediatric patients, respectively. 
Nelarabine and ara-G are not substantially bound to human plasma proteins (less than 25 %) in vitro, 
and binding is independent of nelarabine or ara-G concentrations up to 600 µM. 
No accumulation of nelarabine or ara-G was observed in plasma after nelarabine administration on 
either a daily or a day 1, 3, 5 schedule. 
Intracellular ara-GTP concentrations in leukaemic blasts were quantifiable for a prolonged period after 
nelarabine administration. Intracellular ara-GTP accumulated with repeated administration of 
nelarabine. On the day 1, 3, and 5 schedule, Cmax and AUC(0-t) values on day 3 were approximately 
50 % and 30 %, respectively, greater than Cmax and AUC(0-t) values on day 1. 
Biotransformation 
The principal route of metabolism for nelarabine is O-demethylation by adenosine deaminase to form 
ara-G, which undergoes hydrolysis to form guanine. In addition, some nelarabine is hydrolysed to 
form methylguanine, which is O-demethylated to form guanine. Guanine is N-deaminated to form 
xanthine, which is further oxidized to yield uric acid. 
Elimination 
Nelarabine and ara-G are rapidly eliminated from plasma with a half-life of approximately 30 minutes 
and 3 hours, respectively. These findings were demonstrated in patients with refractory leukaemia or 
lymphoma given a dose of 1,500 mg/m2 nelarabine (adults) or a 650 mg/m2 (paediatrics). 
Combined Phase 1 pharmacokinetic data at nelarabine doses of 104 to 2,900 mg/m2 indicate that mean 
(%CV) clearance (Cl) values for nelarabine are 138 l/h/m2 (104 %) and 125 l/h/m2 (214 %) in adult 
and paediatric patients, respectively, on day 1 (n = 65 adults, n = 21 paediatric patients). The apparent 
clearance of ara-G (Cl/F) is comparable between the two groups [9.5 l/h/m2 (35 %) in adult patients 
and 10.8 l/h/m2 (36 %) in paediatric patients] on day 1. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nelarabine and ara-G are partially eliminated by the kidneys. In 28 adult patients, 24 hours after 
nelarabine infusion on day 1, mean urinary excretion of nelarabine and ara-G was 5.3 % and 23.2 % of 
the administered dose, respectively. Renal clearance averaged 9.0 l/h/m2 (151 %) for nelarabine and 
2.6 l/h/m2 (83 %) for ara-G in 21 adult patients. 
Because the timecourse of intracellular ara-GTP was prolonged, its elimination half-life could not be 
accurately estimated. 
Paediatric population 
Limited clinical pharmacology data are available for patients below the age of 4 years. 
Combined Phase 1 pharmacokinetic data at nelarabine doses of 104 to 2,900 mg/m2 indicate that the 
clearance (Cl) and Vss values for nelarabine and ara-G are comparable between the two groups. 
Further data with respect to nelarabine and ara-G pharmacokinetics in the paediatric population are 
provided in other subsections. 
Gender 
Gender has no effect on nelarabine or ara-G plasma pharmacokinetics. Intracellular ara-GTP Cmax and 
AUC(0–t) values at the same dose level were 2– to 3– fold greater on average in adult female than in 
adult male patients. 
Race 
The effect of race on nelarabine and ara-G pharmacokinetics has not been specifically studied. In a 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic cross study analysis, race had no apparent effect on nelarabine, 
ara-G, or intracellular ara-GTP pharmacokinetics. 
Renal impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of nelarabine and ara-G have not been specifically studied in renally impaired 
or haemodialysed patients. Nelarabine is excreted by the kidney to a small extent (5 to 10 % of the 
administered dose). Ara-G is excreted by the kidney to a greater extent (20 to 30 % of the 
administered nelarabine dose). Adults and children in clinical studies were categorized into the three 
groups according to renal impairment: normal with Clcr greater than 80 ml/min (n = 56), mild with Clcr 
equalling 50 to 80 ml/min (n = 12), and moderate with Clcr less than 50 ml/min (n = 2). The mean 
apparent clearance (Cl/F) of ara-G was about 7 % lower in patients with mild renal impairment than in 
patients with normal renal function (see section 4.2). No data are available to provide a dose advice for 
patients with Clcr less than 50 ml/min. 
Elderly 
Age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of nelarabine or ara-G. Decreased renal function, which is 
more common in the elderly, may reduce ara-G clearance (see section 4.2). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to 
clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: nelarabine caused 
histopathological changes to the central nervous system (white matter vacuolation and degenerative 
changes in cerebrum, cerebellum and spinal cord) of monkeys after daily treatment with nelarabine for 
23 days, at exposures below the human therapeutic exposure. Nelarabine showed in vitro cytotoxicity 
to monocytes and macrophages. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity testing of nelarabine has not been performed. 
Mutagenicity 
Nelarabine was mutagenic to L5178Y/TK mouse lymphoma cells with and without metabolic 
activation. 
Reproduction toxicity 
Compared to controls, nelarabine caused increased incidences of foetal malformations, anomalies, and 
variations in rabbits when given at doses approximately 24 % of the adult human dose on a mg/m2 
basis during the period of organogenesis. Cleft palate was seen in rabbits given a dose approximately 
2-fold the adult human dose, absent pollices in rabbits given a dose approximately 79 % of the adult 
human dose while absent gall bladder, accessory lung lobes, fused or extra sternebrae and delayed 
ossification was seen at all doses. Maternal body weight gain and foetal body weights were reduced in 
rabbits given a dose approximately 2-fold the adult human dose. 
Fertility 
No studies have been conducted in animals to assess the effects of nelarabine on fertility. However, no 
undesirable effects were seen in the testes or ovaries of monkeys given nelarabine intravenously at 
doses up to approximately 32 % of the adult human dose on a mg/m2 basis for 30 consecutive days.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Atriance is and what it is used for 
Atriance contains nelarabine which belongs to a group of medicines known as antineoplastic agents, 
used in chemotherapy to kill some types of cancer cells. 
Atriance is used to treat patients with: 
• 
a type of leukaemia, called T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Leukaemia causes an 
abnormal increase in the number of white blood cells. The abnormal high number of white 
blood cells can appear in the blood and other parts of the body. The type of leukaemia relates to 
the type of white blood cell mainly involved. In this case, its cells are called lymphoblasts. 
a type of lymphoma, called T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. This lymphoma is caused by a 
mass of lymphoblasts, a type of white blood cell. 
• 
If you have any questions about your illness, talk to your doctor 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Atriance 
You (or your child, if he/she is being treated) must not receive Atriance 
• 
if you (or your child, if he/she is being treated) are allergic to nelarabine or any of the other 
ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Severe nervous system side effects have been reported with the use of Atriance. Symptoms may be 
mental (e.g. tiredness) or physical (e.g. convulsions, feelings of numbness or tingling, weakness and 
paralysis). Your doctor will check for these symptoms regularly during treatment (see also 
section 4, "Possible side effects"). 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Your doctor also needs to know the following before you are given this medicine: 
• 
if you (or your child, if he/she is being treated) have any kidney or liver problems. Your 
dose of Atriance may need to be adjusted. 
if you (or your child, if he/she is being treated) have recently been, or plan to be vaccinated 
with a live vaccine (for example polio, varicella, typhoid). 
if you (or your child, if he/she is being treated) have any blood problems (for example 
anaemia). 
• 
• 
Blood tests during treatment 
Your doctor should perform blood tests regularly during treatment to check for blood problems that 
have been associated with the use of Atriance. 
Elderly 
If you are an elderly person, you could be more sensitive to nervous system side effects (see the list 
above under “Warnings and precautions”). Your doctor will check for these symptoms regularly 
during treatment. 
Tell your doctor if any of these apply to you. 
Other medicines and Atriance 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes any herbal products or medicines you have bought without a prescription 
Remember to tell your doctor if you start to take any other medicines while you are on Atriance. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Atriance is not recommended for pregnant women. It may harm a baby if conceived before, during or 
soon after treatment. Consideration to appropriate birth control is recommended to be discussed with 
your doctor. Do not try and become pregnant/father a child until your doctor advises you it is safe to 
do so. 
Male patients, who may wish to father a child, should ask their doctor for family planning advice or 
treatment. If pregnancy occurs during treatment with Atriance, you must tell your doctor immediately. 
It is not known whether Atriance is passed on through breast milk. Breast-feeding must be 
discontinued while you are taking Atriance. Ask your doctor for advice before taking any medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Atriance can make people feel drowsy or sleepy, both during and for some days after treatment. If you 
feel tired or weak, do not drive, and do not use any tools or machines. 
Atriance contains sodium 
This medicine contains 88.51 mg (3.85 mmol) sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) per vial 
(50 ml). This is equivalent to 4.4% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for 
an adult. 
3. 
How Atriance is given 
The dose of Atriance you are given will be based on: 
• 
your/your child's (if he/she is being treated) body surface area (which will be calculated by 
your doctor based on your height and weight). 
the results of blood tests carried out before treatment 
• 
Adults and adolescents (aged 16 years and older) 
The usual dose is 1,500 mg/m2 of body surface area per day. 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A doctor or nurse will give you the dose of Atriance as an infusion (a drip). It is usually dripped into 
your arm over a period of about 2 hours. 
You will have an infusion (a drip) once a day on days 1, 3 and 5 of treatment. This pattern of 
treatment will normally be repeated every three weeks. This treatment may vary, depending on the 
results of your regular blood tests. Your doctor will decide how many treatment cycles are required. 
Children and adolescents (aged 21 years and younger) 
The recommended dose is 650 mg/m2 of body surface area per day. 
A doctor or nurse will give you/your child (if he/she is being treated) a suitable dose of Atriance as 
an infusion (a drip). It is usually dripped into your arm over a period of about 1 hour. 
You/your child (if he/she is being treated) will have an infusion (a drip) once a day for 5 days. 
This pattern of treatment will normally be repeated every three weeks. This treatment may vary, 
depending on the results of regular blood tests. Your doctor will decide how many treatment cycles are 
required. 
Stopping treatment with Atriance 
Your doctor will decide when to stop the treatment. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
The majority of side effects reported with Atriance were seen in adults, children and adolescents. 
Some of the side effects were reported more often in adult patients. There is no known reason for this. 
If you have any concerns, discuss them with your doctor. 
Most serious side effects 
These may affect more than 1 in 10 people treated with Atriance. 
• 
Signs of infection. Atriance may reduce the number of white blood cells and lower your 
resistance to infection (including pneumonia). This can even be life threatening. Signs of an 
infection include: 
fever 
- 
serious deterioration of your general condition 
- 
local symptoms such as sore throat, sore mouth or urinary problems (for example, a 
- 
burning sensation when urinating, which may be a urinary infection) 
Tell your doctor immediately if you get any of these. A blood test will be taken to check possible 
reduction of white blood cells. 
Other very common side effects 
These may affect more than 1 in 10 people treated with Atriance 
• 
Changes in the sense of feeling in hands or feet, muscle weakness appearing as difficulty getting 
up from a chair, or difficulty walking (peripheral neuropathy); reduced sensitivity to light

crawling on the skin. 
Feeling generally weak and tired (temporary anaemia). In some cases you may need a blood 
transfusion. 
Unusual bruising or bleeding, caused by a decrease in the number of clotting cells in the blood. 
This can lead to severe bleeding from relatively small injuries such as a small cut. Rarely, it can 
lead to even more severe bleeding (haemorrhage). Talk to your doctor for advice on how to 
• 
•

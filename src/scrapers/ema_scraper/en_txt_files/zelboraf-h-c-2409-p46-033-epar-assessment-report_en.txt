An Open-Label, Multicenter, Single-Arm, Phase I Dose Escalation with Efficacy Tail Extension Study of 
Vemurafenib (RO5185426) in Pediatric Patients with Surgically Incurable and Unresectable Stage IIIc 
or Stage IV Melanoma Harboring BRAF V600 Mutations – Report No. 1068647, May 2016 
Description 
This was a phase 1, non-randomized, uncontrolled trial conducted in the US and Europe, to estimate 
the maximum tolerated dose and identify the recommended phase 2 dose, in pediatric patients aged 
12-17 with newly diagnosed or recurrent unresectable stage IIIc or IV BRAF mutation positive 
melanoma. 
Secondary objectives included PK, tolerability, safety, and efficacy. Exploratory objectives included 
molecular characteristics of SCC or other new tumours that may occur during treatment, exploratory 
biomarkers of efficacy and safety, and early tumor effects of treatment, as revealed by PET.

Study design 
Study NO25390, otherwise known as BRIM-P, was an open-label, multicenter, single-agent, single-
arm, Phase I dose-escalation with an efficacy tail extension trial of vemurafenib in pediatric patients 
(aged 12 through 17). 
Patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent histologically confirmed surgically incurable and 
unresectable stage IIIc or stage IV (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC]) melanoma harboring 
BRAF V600 mutations as determined by the cobas® 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test were eligible for 
enrollment. Recruitment into the study was competitive. 
Patients entering the dose-escalation portion of the trial were enrolled sequentially to increasing dose 
cohorts of vemurafenib. The efficacy tail extension of the trial was intended to enroll additional 
pediatric patients at the MTD/recommended dose. 
Patients were to receive an oral dose of vemurafenib twice daily (BID) on a continuing basis until 
disease progression, death due to any cause, unacceptable toxicity, discontinuation from the study, or 
other criteria set forth in the protocol. 
Because of the concern that a uniform dose of vemurafenib could lead to a potential overexposure in 
pediatric patients with very low body weights, it was planned to enroll patients into two separate 
cohorts with different starting doses—one for patients weighing ≥ 45 kg and the other for patients 
weighing < 45 kg. The dose-escalation phase for patients weighing ≥ 45 kg followed a classic 3 + 3 
design for Phase I trials. The starting dose for patients in this cohort was 720 mg of vemurafenib by 
mouth BID. For the purposes of the dose-escalation window, patients were evaluated for dose-limiting 
toxicity (DLT) for the first 28 days of study therapy. The next dose level for patients in this cohort was 
960 mg by mouth BID. The starting dose level for patients weighing < 45 kg was to be 480 mg of 
vemurafenib by mouth BID, but no patients were enrolled into this cohort. 
Because of the low number of patients enrolled into the study, the extension phase of the study was 
not conducted.

Estimates generated using these assumptions included the combined absolute number of cases of 
melanoma among patients aged 12 to 18 years in the US, Europe, and Australia and was estimated to 
be approximately 950 cases.

Considering that 1.3% of these patients may present with metastatic disease (based on US 
epidemiological data), it was estimated that approximately 12 patients aged from 12 to 18 years might 
be identified per year in the US, EU, and Australia combined. 
It was specified in the PIP section D.IV.a, Strategy In Relation to Clinical Aspects, that the ability to 
project an accurate worldwide annual incidence of metastatic melanoma in the 12 to 18 year age group 
specified by the EMA was limited by several factors, including: (1) varying age groupings used for 
analysis in the literature and large cancer registry databases (often 5-year groupings, including 
individuals from 18 to < 20 years of age); (2) limited availability of staging data specific to paediatric 
patients; and (3) lack of standardized reporting of patients who are treated with surgery alone versus 
those who receive chemotherapy. 
Based on an assumption of 50% BRAFV600E mutation proportion, it was estimated that the 
approximate number of pediatric patients in Europe, the US, and Australia with BRAFV600E-positive 
metastatic melanoma who might be eligible for the study would be 6 patients per year. 
Enrollment of about 23-35 patients during the accrual period of 3.5 years was planned 
Treatments 
•  Vemurafenib 480 mg PO BID (0 patients < 45 kg enrolled) 
•  Vemurafenib 720 mg PO BID  (3 patients) 
•  Vemurafenib 960 mg PO BID  (3 patients) 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Tumour assessments were performed every 8 weeks for 12 cycles, and every 12 weeks thereafter.  
Statistical Methods 
No formal hypothesis testing was planned or performed. All analyses were descriptive in nature. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Enrollment of about 23-35 patients during the accrual period of 3.5 years was planned. 
Eighteen sites in 5 countries were originally chosen for participation (Australia 2, referral networks with 
NZ and Asia), Germany (3, referral networks in EU, 2 sites accepting international referrals), Italy (3, 
referral networks within EU), UK (2, referral networks in UK, Eire and Scotland), USA (8, 2 sites 
accepting international referrals). 
Between December 2011 and December 2013, 72 patients were pre-screened, 4 were screened, and 3 
were enrolled. Prescreened, but not enrolled patients, were frequently of inappropriate stage (non-
metastatic, n = 43), age (n = 31), or were lacking a BRAF mutation (n = 15, 27/72 tested).  
The low enrollment motivated a second initiative to expand the study to new countries and centers, 
with results of initial feasibility assessment available in December 2012. Of 26 countries approached, 
12 were feasible to conduct the trial in, whereof 10 had interested sites. Five of the 10 feasible and

interested countries had patient population and country approval processes to support the opening of 
the study. As a result 8 new sites in 5 countries were planned to participate from Q1 2014: 
Also, a number of other recruitment activities were undertaken, e.g. global distribution of 5000 leaflets 
showcasing the NO25390 study through sites conference activities or networks. Another 3 patients 
were enrolled during 2014. 
The following circumstances have been highlighted by the applicant to explain the low accrual: 
• 
The rarity of advanced malignant melanoma in this age group 
•  Referral patterns between dermatologisist and paedriatic oncologists, which may favor 
treatment outside clinical trials 
•  Different frequency of BRAF mutations than previously assumed 
• 
Logistical and travel challenges when treated in neighboring country 
•  Competing BRAF trials 
•  Commercial availability of dabrafenib and trametinib

Pharmacokinetic results 
All 6 patients were included in the pharmacokinetic (PK) population.  
Similar to what has been observed in adults patients, substantial accumulation was observed following 
multiple oral doses of vemurafenib, with individual area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) 
Day 22/Day 1 ratios of approximately 11 to 67.  The steady-state exposure (Day 22) was relatively 
constant over the dosing interval, which is also similar to that in adult patients.

AUC (0-12)  = area under the plasma concentration curve from 0 to 12 hours; BID = twice 
daily; Cmax = maximum plasma concentration; CV = coefficient of variation; hr = hour; 
T max = time of maximum plasma concentration. 
The mean concentration at steady state in the 3 adolescent patients receiving 720 mg BID is similar to 
what has been observed in adult patients receiving the same dose (~43 μg/mL from study NP26163).  
The mean concentrations at steady state in the 3 adolescent patients receiving 960 mg BID (~71 to 91 
μg/mL as observed on Day 22) appear to be higher than the population PK model predicted mean 
Cmin and Cmax values in adults (~61 and 64 μg/mL).  
CHMP comment: Given the very limited PK information with the 960 BID dose from the current study 
(n=3), and the relatively large variability around the mean that has been observed in adults, it is not 
possible to draw the conclusion on that adolescents have higher exposure than adults at this dose.

Best overall response rate 
None of the 6 patients in the study had a confirmed response (CR or PR); therefore, the BORR was 
0%. Four patients (66.7%) had a best overall confirmed response of SD (one patient in Cohort 1 and 
all 3 patients in Cohort 2). Duration of response could not be calculated as no confirmed responses 
were observed. 
Clinical benefit rate 
None of the 6 patients in the study had a confirmed response. Four patients had an overall response 
status of SD for at least 6 weeks; therefore, the CBR was 66.7%. 
Progression-free survival 
PFS was 76, 83, and 138 days for the 3 patients in Cohort 1, and 131, 157, and 294 days for the 3 
patients in Cohort 2. The median PFS was 134.5 days (95% CI: 83.0, 157.0). 
Overall survival 
Survival was 93, 185, and 364 days for the 3 patients in Cohort 1, and 156, 308, and 514 days for the 
3 patients in Cohort 2. Survival was censored only for Patient 4 (on Day 514). The median OS was 
246.5 days (95% CI: 156.0, 364.0). 
CHMP comment 
In the adult pivotal vemurafenib trial NO25026, with a median of 13.4  months of follow-up, median 
OS in the vemurafenib arm was 13.6 months (about 415 days). Median PFS was 6.9 months (about

209 days). The overall response rate was 48%. 
The comparison of findings in adolescents to those in adult patients is hampered by the very limited 
enrollment in the NO25390 study, and the lack of a control arm. Acknowledging these limitations, 
vemurafenib efficacy seems reduced in the younger patients. Please submit waterfall plots of tumor 
response in individual patients at 8 weeks, 16 weeks, and forth.

Dose limiting toxicity 
No DLTs were observed in the first cohort of 3 patients treated at 720 mg BID. Patient 3 experienced a 
Grade 3 photosensitivity during the DLT evaluation period (onset on Day 13), but the patient did not 
require a vemurafenib dose reduction. According to the investigator, the event did not qualify as a DLT 
per the protocol. 
No DLTs were observed in the second cohort of 3 patients treated at 960 mg BID, which is equal to the 
adult recommended dose. Patient 6 experienced a Grade 3 rash maculo-papular during the DLT 
evaluation period (onset on Day 9), but the patient did not require a vemurafenib dose reduction. 
According to the investigator the event did not qualify as a DLT per the protocol. 
Accordingly, an MTD could not be determined in this study. In lieu of establishing an MTD, the Sponsor 
has instead concluded, based on the limited data available, that the recommended dose of

vemurafenib in adolescent patients should be expressed as an “upper limit”, or “not to exceed” daily 
dose, of 960 mg BID of vemurafenib. 
CHMP comment 
An “upper limit”, or “not to exceed” daily dose for adolescents is not accepted. The PK data available 
for the study population is very limited. An addition to section 5.2 of the SPC in the planned type II 
variation should be considered. 
Common adverse events 
The most common preferred and SOC terms were: 
•  All patients: musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders  
•  5/6 patients: gastrointestinal disorders 
•  4/6 patients: diarrhoea, headache, general disorders and administration site conditions, 
infections and infestations, investigations, nervous system disorders 
•  3/6 patients: photosensitivity reaction, rash, nausea, fatigue, metabolism and nutrition 
disorders, renal and urinary disordes, respiratory thoracic and mediastinal disorders, vascular 
disorders 
•  2/6 patients: back pain, pain in extremity, alopecia, dry skin, rash maculo-papular, vomiting, 
ALT increased, platelets decreased, WBC decreased, hyperglycaemia, oropharyngeal pain, 
flushing, hypertension, anemia, blood and lymphatic system disorders, cardiac disorders, injury 
poisoning and procedural complications, neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified 
CHMP comment 
Adverse events are consistent with findings in the adult population. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
• 
• 
Patient 6 had an SAE of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. The patient was diagnosed 
concurrently with a cutaneous basal cell carcinoma. The events occurred on Day 85; both 
events were SAEs. The events were Grade 3 in intensity and, in the opinion of the investigator, 
were related to study drug. 
Four patient deaths (66.7%) were attributed to PD, and 1 patient (16.7%) died due to an AE of 
intracranial tumor hemorrhage in a patient with pre-existing intracranial disease (Patient 2). 
The AE occurred on Day 304, after the patient had discontinued study drug due to PD on Day 
294 (confirmed by brain CT), and the patient died on Day 309. In the opinion of the 
investigator, the event of intracranial tumor hemorrhage was not related to study drug.

CHMP comment: 
Adverse events are consistent with findings in the adult population. 
Adverse events that led do dose modification 
No patient had an AE that led to discontinuation of study drug, or dose reduction of study drug. Two 
patients had study drug temporarily held due to AEs: 
• 
• 
Patient 2 had an SAE of nephrolithiasis (Grade 2) on Day 32 that led to study drug being 
withheld for 5 days. The event resolved on Day 37 and study drug administration was resumed 
on Day 38 with no dose reduction. In the opinion of the investigator, the event was not related 
to treatment with study drug. 
Patient 4 had an AE of skin infection (Grade 1) on Day 85 that led to study drug being withheld 
for 18 days. The event resolved on Day 101 and study drug administration was resumed on 
Day 103 with no dose reduction. In the opinion of the investigator, the event was not related 
to treatment with study drug. 
1.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The BRIM-P (NO25390) study in paediatric patients has had recruitment difficulties, only 6 of planned 
23-35 patients were recruited during 4 years. Factors explaining these problems, as highlighted by the 
MAH, include rarity of advanced malignant melanoma in the 12-17 year age group, referral patterns 
between dermatologisist and paedriatic oncologists, a different frequency of BRAF mutations than 
previously assumed in paedriatic patients, logistical and travel challenges when treated in neighboring 
countries, competing BRAF trials, and commercial availability of dabrafenib and trametinib. 
The difficulties encountered motivated opening of additional study sites in more countries, and other 
activities to increase health care provider awareness of the study. The applicant also discussed these 
recruitment issues and concerns about study feasibility with the paediatric coordinator in November 
2014 and again with the paediatric coordinator and the peer reviewer in July 2015. The Agency was 
informed by the applicant about the anticipated study closure in December 2015. In March 2016, a 
request for modification of the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan (EMEA-000978-PIP01-M01) was 
submitted by the MAH, requesting the deletion of the expansion phase of BRIM-P. In their decision, the 
PDCO agreed to replace the PIP with a product-specific waiver. 
2.  Overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
The low number of patients in BRIM-P (NO25390) limits conclusions. The PDCO has agreed to replace 
the PIP with a product-specific waiver. There are no apparent new safety concerns. Vemurafenib 
efficacy seems reduced in 12 – 17 year old patients, although uncertainty must be acknowledged; 
estimates were derived from 6 patients only. A waterfall plot of tumor response in individual patients 
at 8 weeks, 16 weeks and subsequent assessments, is asked for.

An “upper limit”, or “not to exceed” daily dose for adolescents is not accepted, as the PK data available 
for the study population is very limited. 
The planned type II variation to inform the SPC on data from adolescent patients should be submitted. 
Recommendation  
  Fulfilled: 
  Not fulfilled: 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide additional efficacy data analysis and further 
justification for an “upper limit”, or “not to exceed” daily dose for adolescents as part of this procedure. 
(see section IV “Additional clarifications requested”) 
Additional clarifications requested 
1.  A waterfall plot of tumor response in individual patients at 8 weeks, 16 weeks and subsequent 
assessments, is asked for. 
2.  An “upper limit”, or “not to exceed” daily dose for adolescents is questioned, as the PK data 
available for the study population is very limited. Please provide additional motivation for this 
constraint. 
3.  A variation should be submitted (directly), as the MAH has identified changes to be made to 
the product information, in accordance with the ’ European Medicines Agency post-
authorization procedural advice for users of the centralized procedure’ section on article 46 
pediatric study submission.

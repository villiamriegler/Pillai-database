2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
About the product 
Oyavas (Company code MB02) has been developed as a similar biological medicinal product 
(biosimilar) to the reference medicinal product Avastin,
which contains bevacizumab as the active 
substance.  
MB02 (bevacizumab) belongs to the pharmacotherapeutic group: “monoclonal antibodies” (ATC code: 
L01XC07). 
Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody, which specifically binds to human 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), preventing its interaction with VEGF receptors (VEGFRs) on 
the surface of endothelial cells. As a result, the VEGFR-dependent signalling pathways required to 
promote and maintain blood vessel formation (angiogenesis) are inhibited. Through this mechanism, 
bevacizumab can potentially reduce tumour size by promoting regression of existing tumour 
vasculature and inhibit tumour growth by inhibiting the formation of new tumour blood vessels.  
The Applicant claims the same therapeutic indications for MB02 as granted for Avastin
in the EU, 
except for the treatment of platinum-resistant recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary 
peritoneal cancer with paclitaxel. Oyavas is intended for the treatment of carcinoma of the colon or 
rectum, breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell cancer, epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or 
Assessment report  
EMA/197736/2021  
Page 14/125 
 
 
 
 
 
 
primary peritoneal cancer, and carcinoma of the cervix (see section 1). The recommended posology 
and method of administration correspond to those of Avastin.  
Oyavas must be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of 
antineoplastic medicinal products. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Oyavas has been developed as biosimilar to the reference medicinal product Avastin (EMA product 
number EMEA/H/C/000582). The finished product is presented as concentrate for solution for infusion 
containing 25 mg/mL of bevacizumab as active substance. The product is supplied in two 
presentations, i.e. 100 mg/4 mL and 400 mg/16 mL single-use vials (8 mL and 20 mL, respectively). 
Other ingredients are: trehalose dihydrate, sodium phosphate (monobasic sodium phosphate 
monohydrate and disodium phosphate), polysorbate 20, and water for injections.  
The product is available in Type I glass vials closed with a chlorobutyl stopper and an aluminium seal 
with a polypropylene flip-off cap.

The active substance of Oyavas (also referred to as MB02) is bevacizumab (INN), a recombinant 
humanised IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody directed against VEGF-A. Binding of bevacizumab to 
VEGF-A neutralises the biological activity of VEGF-A by blocking binding of VEGF-A to its receptors. 
Bevacizumab does not display Fc effector functions. Oyavas is produced from a mammalian Chinese 
hamster ovarian (CHO) cell line. It consists of 2 heavy chains (HC) of the lgG1 subclass (453 aa) and 2 
light chains (LC) of the kappa subclass (214 aa) connected by intra- and interchain disulphide bonds. 
The N-glycosylation site is located at amino acid position Asn303 on the heavy chain. The theoretical 
molecular mass of the fully assembled antibody is 149199.86 Da (main glycoform G0F/G0F).  
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Manufacturers 
GH Genhelix S.A. (Armunia, León, Spain) manufactures MB02 active substance in accordance with 
current good manufacturing practices (GMP). 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
MB02 is expressed in a CHO cell line using a fed-batch process. Manufacture of a batch starts from a 
single vial of the working cell bank (WCB). After thawing, the cells are expanded under controlled 
conditions in multiple steps to obtain sufficient cells for inoculation of single-use production 
bioreactors. The unprocessed bulk from the end of production bioreactors step is clarified through a 
series of depth filters. 
MB02 is purified by a series of column chromatography steps. The manufacturing process includes two 
dedicated, orthogonal virus clearance steps, i.e. virus inactivation and virus removal. The formulated 
MB02 active substance is filtered, filled into bottles and stored.  
Assessment report  
EMA/197736/2021  
Page 15/125 
 
 
 
 
Overall, the process parameters and in-process controls in combination with the other control 
measures appear sufficient to ensure quality and safety of MB02 and to monitor process consistency. 
The process parameters, which are classified into critical process parameters (CPP), well-controlled 
critical process parameters (WC-CPP), non-critical (NCPP) process parameters, and general process 
parameters (GPP), are based on enhanced knowledge gained by process experience throughout 
process development, manufacture of clinical batches, and process characterisation at small scale. 
Three categories of in-process tests, i.e. in-process controls, in-process parameters, and in-process 
testing, have been defined by the Applicant. The in-process tests and their limits have been derived 
from process understanding and under consideration of safety aspects. 
Control of materials 
Raw materials are of compendial quality or adequate in-house specifications have been established. 
Composition and preparation of cell culture media and buffer solutions are sufficiently described. 
Significant single-use materials as well as relevant processing materials are registered. No direct 
animal-derived materials but some materials of indirect animal origin are used during manufacture of 
MB02 active substance (please refer to section on adventitious agents below). 
The construction of the expression vector and its genetic elements are described in sufficient detail. 
The origin of the antibody sequence is briefly described; the correct nucleotide and amino acid 
sequence was confirmed. The information provided on the origin and history of the parental CHO cell 
line and generation of the final production clone is acceptable. The applicant has established a two-
tiered cell bank system with Master Cell Bank (MCB) and Working Cell Bank (WCB). Cell banking 
procedures are adequately described. A protocol describing manufacture and qualification of new WCBs 
has been registered. Characterisation of the expression construct and cell substrate including MCB, 
WCB, and end of production cell bank (EoPCB) is in line with ICH guidelines Q5A, Q5B and Q5D. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The Applicant followed an enhanced development approach using existing knowledge, process 
development and manufacturing experience, risk assessment tools, and process characterisation 
studies to develop a control strategy as outlined in ICH Q11 and EMA/CHMP/BWP/187338/2014.  
A comprehensive set of product variants, process-related impurities and so called `obligatory´ quality 
attributes (i.e. protein content, general and microbial attributes) that cover the relevant attributes of 
MB02 was assessed and an impact score based on impact on biological activity, PK/PD, 
immunogenicity and safety was assigned to each quality attribute. The criticality score was determined 
from the impact score and the uncertainty score using a quantitative risk ranking matrix. The relevant 
CQA of bevacizumab have been identified; the individual impact and uncertainty scores as well as 
justifications for the scoring are agreeable.  
Process characterisation studies were used to systematically evaluate process parameters with regard 
to their impact on process performance and product quality and inform regression models for 
determination of proven acceptable ranges (PAR).  
Process validation 
The Applicant follows a process validation lifecycle strategy as described in Guideline 
EMA/CHMP/BWP/187338/2014 comprising process characterisation, process verification/process 
performance qualification (PPQ), and ongoing process verification throughout the lifecycle. The 
prospective process verification encompassed manufacture of process validation batches according to 
the intended commercial process at the intended commercial manufacturing site and scale. 
Confirmation of adequate removal of process- and product related impurities and of hold times for 
process intermediate pools were part of the validation activities. The validation results, which were all 
Assessment report  
EMA/197736/2021  
Page 16/125 
 
 
 
 
within their specified acceptance criteria, demonstrate that the process performs consistently and 
delivers active substance complying with the release specifications under commercial operating 
conditions. The results confirm that the process-related impurities are consistently reduced to low 
levels/below the LOQ and that product-related impurities are controlled at low level. Potential 
leachables originating from single-use equipment have been addressed. Overall, the data on re-use of 
the chromatography resins support the proposed lifetime.  A summary of the shipping validation has 
been added to the dossier.  
Manufacturing process development 
Early development was performed at 500 L scale and comprehensively presented. Based on experience 
gained the process was further developed, optimized and scaled-up to the intended scale at the 
intended manufacturing site for the European market GH Genhelix S.A. (Armunia, León, Spain). Prior 
to manufacture of active substance for the pivotal clinical trials (comparative PK, safety, and 
immunogenicity study MB02-A-02-17; comparative efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity study MB02-
C-01-17) the process was further optimised. In addition, during production of active substance for the 
pivotal phase III study MB02-C-01-17 the UF/DF step was optimised to improve the adjustment of the 
protein concentration.  
Comparability of MB02 active substance from the 500 L and the commercial process was not directly 
evaluated but finished product from the site used to manufacture clinical material or intended 
commercial site using active substance from the 500 L and commercial process, respectively, was 
shown to be comparable (please refer to finished product section). The pivotal clinical phase I and 
phase III studies were performed with active substance manufactured with the intended commercial 
process (except for the modified UF/DF step which was implemented during the pivotal comparative 
phase III study).  
Characterisation 
The Applicant comprehensively characterised the structure and biological properties of MB02 using 
orthogonal, state-of-the art analytical methods. The amino acid sequence of MB02 was experimentally 
confirmed by peptide mapping with 100% sequence coverage. Presence of C- and N-terminal variants 
(pyroglutamate, Lys-clipping), oxidation, and deamidation is presented. The higher order structure was 
evaluated by a combination of disulphide bridge mapping, far-UV CD, hydrogen/deuterium exchange 
mass spectrometry, µDSC, and DLS. Charge and size variants were determined using complementary 
analytical methods (CEX-HPLC, cIEF and CE-SDS, SE-HPLC, respectively). Glycoanalysis comprised the 
identification of the oligosaccharide pattern and site occupancy by peptide mapping and HILIC-UPLC-
FLR; in addition, sialic acid content (NeuAc and NeuGc) was determined by UHPL-FLR. The absence of 
alpha-1,3-galactose structures has been demonstrated. The biological characterisation included an 
assessment of binding to VEGF variant and PlGF and to VEGF-A165 by ELISA as well as of functional 
activity in cell-based assays (HUVEC). In addition, absence of Fc effector functions (ADCC and CDC) 
was confirmed in cell-based assays. The presented data confirm the expected structural and functional 
characteristics of bevacizumab.  
Product-related variants and impurities detected by SEC- and CEX-HPLC were identified and 
characterised using relevant orthogonal methods. Functional characterisation of the variants/impurities 
included determination of VEGF binding by competitive ELISA.  
The levels of HHL fragments, as observed by non-reducing CE-SDS, were demonstrated to be higher in 
MB02 active substance as compared to Avastin. Detailed analyses by peptide mapping and mass 
spectrometry revealed amino acid substitutions, with relevant substitution levels (>1%) only occurring 
at position HC226. Extensive experiments support the Applicant´s conclusion that the amino acid 
substitution is metabolic. As demonstrated in the analytical similarity assessment (please refer to 
Assessment report  
EMA/197736/2021  
Page 17/125 
 
 
 
 
discussion of analytical similarity) higher order structure and biological activity was highly comparable 
between MB02 and the reference product further indicating that the amino acid replacements have no 
impact on efficacy. Immunogenicity may potentially be affected by the replacement; however, the 
clinical data do not indicate immunogenicity issues with MB02. Absolute quantitation based on stable 
isotope labelling revealed relative levels of amino acid substitution at HC226 of 1.29±0.23%. The 
chemistry behind the change and the related information has been sufficiently discussed by the 
Applicant. 
The Applicant described future options to minimise the amino acid substitution in the commercial 
process and submitted a corresponding post approval change management protocol (PACMP) for 
implementation of an optimised active substance manufacturing process. The initially submitted PACMP 
has been revised and is now acceptable.  
Specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis, 
and container closure 
The proposed set of quality attributes included in the specifications for release and stability testing of 
MB02 active substance complies with ICH Q6B, Ph. Eur. 2031 and EMA/CHMP/BWP/532517/2008 and 
is acceptable. The release specification for MB02 active substance comprises tests for identity, purity 
and impurities, potency, quantity, microbiological attributes and general attributes. 
In addition to manufacturing process capability, batch release and stability data (including the clinical 
batches), data from the analytical similarity exercise, and characterisation data, the Applicant took into 
account regulatory requirements from the Ph. Eur. and relevant guidelines to justify the specifications.  
From a current perspective, the proposed specification limits are agreeable. The limits for several 
specification parameters were tightened upon request. The Applicant committed to re-evaluate several 
limits after at least 30 commercial batches have been manufactured (See “Recommendations for future 
quality development”). 
Analytical Methods 
The analytical methods are sufficiently described and considered adequate. For determination of HCP, a 
commercial generic test kit is currently used; however, the Applicant intend to implement a process 
specific HCP ELISA method: a time plan for implementation has been provided (See 
“Recommendations for future quality development”). The implemented system suitability tests (SST) 
and sample acceptance criteria appear suitable to provide adequate control over analytical method 
performance.  
Overall, the presented analytical method validations are adequate and demonstrate the suitability of 
the analytical procedures for their intended use. The relevant analytical method parameters have been 
assessed in accordance with ICH Q2(R1). Robustness of the methods has been sufficiently 
demonstrated by extensive robustness data.  
Potency is determined by a combination of a competitive VEGF-binding ELISA and a relevant cell-based 
assay that measures inhibition of proliferation.  
Reference Standards 
The history of reference standards used throughout development of MB02 is presented. Recently, a 
two-tiered system with primary reference standard and secondary reference standards has been 
implemented. The reference materials were adequately qualified according to the development phase 
using release and additional characterisation tests. The procedures for assignment and stability 
monitoring of potency of the reference standards are acceptable.

Batch Analyses 
Batch release data are presented for active substance batches manufactured according to the intended 
commercial manufacturing process at the intended commercial site GH Genhelix S.A., Spain. The 
batches were used in the pivotal clinical studies, for demonstration of analytical similarity, in stability 
studies as well as for process validation purposes. All results comply with the specifications at time of 
testing and the commercial specifications. The presented results demonstrate that the manufacturing 
process reliably delivers MB02 active substance with consistent quality. 
Container closure 
MB02 active substance is stored in bottles with screw cap closures. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. 
and/or USP requirements and Commission Regulation (EU) No. 10/2011 on plastic materials and 
articles in contact with food. Compatibility has been demonstrated by stability studies and additional 
compatibility studies.  
Stability 
Based on the updated stability data, the Applicant presented a shelf life claim. 
The ongoing stability studies are conducted at long-term storage conditions as well as under 
accelerated conditions using MB02 active substance batches that were manufactured according to the 
intended commercial manufacturing process at the intended commercial site. In addition, forced 
degradation studies applying several stress conditions were performed.  
The design of the studies is in accordance with ICH Q5C. The samples are stored in bottles 
representative of the commercial container closure system and were filled to the same level as the 
commercial container closure. Overall, the analytical programme follows the proposed active substance 
specifications and includes stability indicating methods. Results were statistically evaluated for trends. 
At long-term and accelerated conditions, all results comply with the acceptance criteria for the studies 
as well as the proposed commercial specification limits. No obvious relevant trends are present at long-
term conditions. 
No major effects on quality of MB02 were observed in the forced degradation studies. Further 
comparative stress stability studies were conducted as part of the analytical similarity exercise. The 
presented data support the proposed shelf life in the defined container closure system. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development  
The finished product is a sterile, preservative-free concentrate for solution for infusion containing 25 
mg/mL of bevacizumab as active substance and is supplied in two presentations: MB02 100 mg/4 mL 
and MB02 400 mg/16 mL single-use vials. 
Bevacizumab is formulated with trehalose dihydrate, sodium phosphate (as monobasic sodium 
phosphate monohydrate and as disodium phosphate), polysorbate 20 and water for injections. The 
formulation is identical to that of the reference medicinal product. 
MB02 finished product does not contain any overages. To ensure that each vial contains a volume 
sufficient for withdrawal, the Applicant is proposing a target fill volume of 4.30 mL and 16.60 mL for 
the 100 mg and 400 mg strength, respectively. The proposed target fill volume appears sufficiently 
justified. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197736/2021  
Page 19/125 
 
 
 
 
The excipients used for MB02 active substance and finished product are of compendial quality and the 
same as the excipients used in the EU-authorised reference product (Avastin). The excipients include a 
buffering agent to stabilise pH, non-reducing disaccharide as lyo/cryo-protectant and stabiliser against 
thermal stress, and a surfactant for preventing aggregation upon mechanical and freeze-thaw stresses. 
The formulation of MB02 is identical to that of the reference product Avastin. The suitability of the 
formulation for MB02 was justified by data derived from stability studies. Furthermore, formulation 
robustness was assessed under accelerated/stress/freeze-thaw conditions. The proposed formulation is 
considered suitable for MB02. 
Manufacturing process development 
Manufacture of the finished product includes thawing and pooling of active substance, sterile filtration, 
aseptic filling into vials and packaging.  
The process development activities addressed defining the quality target product profile (QTPP), 
identifying critical quality attributes (CQAs), risk assessment and identification of critical process 
parameters (CPPs), and establishing a process control strategy to ensure that CQAs are met. 
The process control strategy was based on the evaluation of CQAs and CPPs. The following control 
elements are included: control of excipients and raw materials, in-process testing, release testing, 
characterization of impurities, stability monitoring, process performance qualification, and control of 
environmental factors and adventitious agents. A clear link of each control element to each CQA has 
been provided. Taken together, the control strategy appears adequate. 
The Applicant has outlined a summary of manufacturing process changes that occurred between early 
phase clinical development and late phase clinical development and commercial production. The 
potential impact of manufacturing process changes to the quality of MB02 has been evaluated in 
comparability studies. 
Comparability study 1 and 2 compared early phase clinical material to late phase/pivotal clinical 
finished product development. Comparability study 1 includes extensive physicochemical and biological 
characterization studies while Comparability study 2 includes forced/stressed degradation studies. Full 
comparability reports including batch data have been provided. The presented data indicate that early 
phase clinical material is comparable to late phase clinical material. 
Comparability Study 3 compared MB02 manufactured at the proposed commercial manufacturing site 
using the filling Line 1 versus filling Line 2. Comparability was assessed by evaluating release data and 
extended characterization. The provided data indicate comparability of material manufactured using 
filling Line 1 vs. filling Line 2.  
Container closure system 
The container closure system consists of 8 mL vials for MB02 100 mg/4 mL presentation and 20 mL 
vials for MB02 400 mg/16 mL presentation. These containers comprise a clear, sterilized Type I 
borosilicate glass vial, closed with Type I chlorobutyl rubber stopper and an aluminium seal fitted with 
a plastic flip-off cap. The vial, stopper and seal components are compliant with appropriate Ph. Eur. 
monographs for primary containers and closures. 
The suitability of the container closure system used for storage, transportation and use of MB02 
finished product was demonstrated by the studies assessing the appropriateness of materials 
(compliance to standards and extractable assessment), compatibility of materials of construction with 
dosage form (leachable assessment), functional performance, and container closure integrity. The 
long-term compatibility of MB02 finished product with the container closure system is demonstrated 
from stability data.  
Assessment report  
EMA/197736/2021  
Page 20/125 
 
 
 
 
The Applicant committed to present the results of the ongoing leachables study when the study is 
finalized (See “Recommendations for future quality development”). MB02 finished product is intended 
to be diluted in sodium chloride 0.9% w/v. Compatibility has been evaluated for polyolefin (PO) bags 
as well as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags Results demonstrate in-use stability of MB02 in infusion bags 
up to 30 days at 2-8°C followed by 48h at 30°C. This is appropriately reflected in the SmPC. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured, packaged, controlled and released in accordance with the 
current Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). Certificates confirming GMP compliance have been 
provided or are available via EudraGMDP. 
EU batch release is performed at GH, Genhelix S.A., Parque Tecnológico de León, Edificio GENHELIX, 
C/Julia Morros, s/n, Armunia, 24009 León, Spain. 
MB02 finished product is manufactured according to a standard manufacturing process including active 
substance thawing and pooling (Step 1 and Step 2), bioburden reduction filtration (Step 3), sterilizing 
filtration/aseptic filling (Step 4), visual inspection (Step 5), and secondary packaging & storage (Step 
6).  
The control strategy has been established to ensure that CQAs consistently remain within acceptable 
limits. Critical in-process parameters are either controlled via in-process controls (IPCs) or in-process 
tests (IPTs). Critical process parameters are controlled or monitored with an acceptable range, which 
has been defined based on product development studies and existing product knowledge. 
Process validation 
The process validation studies were performed according to a classical approach. Batches were 
manufactured for each of the two presentations. Minimum and maximum batch sizes were considered 
for both presentations. Process parameters were set based on results obtained in manufacturing 
process development studies according to normal operating ranges. 
The in-process test results met pre-defined acceptance criteria in most instances; excursions have 
been adequately investigated and addressed.  
Analytical release testing was performed in line with specifications proposed for release of commercial 
batches. The release test results were well within pre-defined specifications for all process validation 
batches.  
The process validation data overall indicate that the finished product manufacturing process 
consistently yields finished product meeting its pre-determined quality attributes. 
Furthermore, the Applicant provided a risk assessment as regards potential leachables from the single-
use equipment, and the associated risk can be considered as negligible. Also, a summary of all 
deviations observed in the course of process validation studies has been provided and the respective 
handling appears appropriate. 
Sterile filter validation was performed. The Applicant presented data on media fills which gave 
satisfactory results. Based on the results obtained, the maximum aseptic process time is considered 
sufficiently validated. 
Transport/shipping has been adequately validated, and a respective summary has been included in the 
dossier.

Product specification 
The specifications proposed for release and stability testing of MB02 finished product comply with ICH 
Q6B, Ph. Eur. 2031, and EMA/CHMP/BWP/532517/2008 GL. The specifications include tests for 
appearance, general tests, tests for identity, tests for purity/product-related impurities, biological 
activity (competitive binding ELISA, HUVEC bioassay), quantity, tests for contaminants, and container 
closure integrity.  
The proposed acceptance criteria have been justified and are considered acceptable. Justifications 
included overall knowledge based on release and stability data for MB02 batches, clinical qualification 
by means of batches used in clinical trials, as well as data on the reference product Avastin. 
In line with the active substance section, the Applicant committed to re-evaluate several limits after at 
least 30 batches of commercial material have been manufactured (See “Recommendations for future 
quality development”).  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities as part of the ongoing 
leachables study. Based on the risk assessment and ICP-MS data it can be concluded that it is not 
necessary to include any elemental impurity controls in the finished product specification. The 
information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. As the leachables study is still 
ongoing the Applicant committed to also present these data when the study is finalized (See 
“Recommendations for future quality development”).  
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed (as requested) in line with the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation 
holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on 
nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- 
Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human 
medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided it is accepted that no risk 
was identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related 
finished product. Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed necessary. 
Analytical procedures 
With the exception of the finished product specific general tests, all analytical methods are common for 
MB02 active substance and MB02 finished product. These common methods are described and 
discussed in the respective active substance section. The finished product specific general tests are 
performed according to Ph. Eur. and USP.  
Batch analyses 
Batch analyses data are presented for both presentations (i.e. 100 mg / 4 mL and 400 mg / 16 mL). 
The respective results comply with the specifications valid at time of release testing and indicate a 
consistent manufacturing process.  
Stability of the product 
The Applicant is proposing a shelf-life of 30 months when stored at the intended long-term condition 
(i.e. 2-8°C, protected from light). Data up to 30 months are available for GMP batches of MB02 
finished product in 4 mL vials and GMP batches of MB02 finished product in 16 mL vials. Additional 
stability data are available for additional clinical batches, and for PPQ batches. Stability data at 
accelerated conditions (25ºC ± 2ºC/60% ± 5% RH) are available for most batches. 
Degradation pathways have been evaluated in forced degradation studies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/197736/2021  
Page 22/125 
 
 
 
 
Photostability testing was conducted in line with ICH Q1B. Based on the study results, it can be 
concluded that MB02 should be stored protected from light and this is appropriately reflected in the 
SmPC. 
Furthermore, stress stability of the finished product was studied in the secondary packing to reflect 
real-life conditions. The provided data indicate that MB02 finished product is stable upon short term 
excursion at high temperature or low temperature (40ºC / 60% RH or -20ºC for 3 days), upon 
agitation (300 rpm), freeze and thaw and exposure to ambient and UV light while enclosed in the 
secondary package. 
Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 30 days at 2ºC to 8ºC plus an 
additional 48 hours at temperature not exceeding 30°C in sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution 
for injection. 
Taken together, the presented data sufficiently support the proposed shelf-life of 30 months when 
stored at the intended storage conditions (i.e. 2-8°C, protected from light). 
Biosimilarity 
Analytical similarity of MB02 was assessed in a comprehensive similarity exercise using EU-sourced 
Avastin as reference medicinal product. The approach and methodology of the analytical similarity 
assessment is sufficiently described and overall acceptable.  
Several MB02 finished product lots of the 100 mg/4 mL and 400 mg/16 mL presentations) were 
included in the analytical similarity exercise. The active substance batches were manufactured 
according to the intended commercial process at the intended commercial site GH Genhelix S.A., the 
corresponding finished product lots have been manufactured at the intended commercial site. The 
MB02 batches/lots have been used in the pivotal PK study and the comparative NSCLC study and for 
active substance/finished product process validation and stability studies. The lot-to-lot variability is 
considered to be sufficiently reflected. 
The reference product EU-Avastin was procured over an extended period. Several lots (100 mg/4 mL 
and 400 mg/16 mL presentations) including most of the lots used in the comparative clinical studies 
were analysed. The number of lots is expected to sufficiently reflect variability and appears adequate 
for evaluation of similarity. In addition to EU-sourced Avastin, US-sourced Avastin (100 mg/4 mL and 
400 mg/16 mL presentations) have been included – these data are provided for information only as the 
pivotal clinical studies have been performed with EU-Avastin.  
A broad range of lot ages is covered for the proposed biosimilar and the reference product with 
sufficient overlap between both products.  
The Applicant followed a tiered approach to demonstrate analytical similarity. Based on their criticality, 
quality attributes/corresponding analytical methods were assigned to three tiers with assessment 
criteria of different stringency. Tier 1 included QAs with highest risk ranking directly related to the 
mechanism of action (i.e. binding to VEGF), quantitative attributes not directly related to the 
mechanism of action were assigned to Tier 2, and Tier 3 comprised QAs with lowest risk ranking and 
QAs not amendable to quantitation. The comparability ranges were based on analytical characterisation 
of EU-Avastin and set to mean ± 2 SD (Tier 1) and mean ± 3 SD (Tier 2; for highly variable Tier 2 
methods: mean ± 2 SD), respectively; for several Tier 2 parameters a pre-defined limit derived from 
method capability was used (e.g. mass spectrometry). For Tier 3 attributes, data were visually 
compared. In principle, the Applicant´s approach to set the comparability ranges based on ± x SD is 
acceptable if data are normally distributed and are not impacted by few extreme results (for most 
attributes this seems to be the case). It is noted that the justification for the statistical approach is 
limited. However, the Applicant provided graphical and tabular presentations of individual analytical 
Assessment report  
EMA/197736/2021  
Page 23/125 
 
 
 
 
results as well as descriptive statistics, which enable also an assessment independent of the defined 
quality ranges. 
The selected comprehensive set of orthogonal state-of-the–art analytical methods, which covers 
primary and higher order structure, post-translational modifications, size and charge variants, larger 
aggregates, general attributes, as well as Fab- or Fc-mediated biological functions, appears adequate 
to address the relevant quality attributes of bevacizumab. The Fab-mediated mechanism of action was 
evaluated by a range of biological assays at different levels (binding to various VEGF isoforms, HUVEC 
anti-proliferation assay, VEGF blocker reporter gene assay, receptor dimerization assay). Biological 
characteristics were further compared with regard to Fc receptor and mannose receptor binding, C1q 
binding, and CDC and ADCC activity. Adequate descriptions and qualification data have been provided 
for the analytical methods used for the analytical comparability exercise. 
For many quality attributes, MB02 was demonstrated to be analytically highly similar to Avastin EU. 
The primary structure attributes molecular mass, amino acid sequence (low level metabolic amino acid 
substitutions were detected for MB02 – see below), post translational modifications (oxidation, 
isomerisation, deamidation, O-glycosylation), extinction coefficient, protein concentration as well as 
the higher order structure (disulphide structure, CD, Fluorescence, HDX, µDSC, DLS) were shown to be 
highly similar. Concerning biological activity, similarity was demonstrated for the mechanism of action 
(VEGF binding including the relevant isoforms, VEGF neutralisation, anti-proliferation) as well as for 
binding to FcRIIa, FcRIIb, FcRIIIa V/F (by SPR), FcRn, mannose receptors and C1q. Lack of CDC and 
ADCC activity was confirmed for both MB02 and Avastin. 
Results from several analytical methods show differences between MB02 and the reference product EU-
Avastin:  
Compared to EU-Avastin slightly lower glycation levels were observed for MB02. Biological activity is 
not impacted by the different glycation levels. 
Minor differences are observed between MB02 and EU-Avastin regarding N- and C-terminal integrity. 
No effect on clinical performance is expected. 
A somewhat higher level of free thiols is present in MB02 compared to EU-Avastin which was initially 
explained by metabolic amino acid substitutions present in MB02. However, further analysis revealed 
that the higher level of free thiols cannot only be attributed to the amino acid substitution. No impact 
on VEGF binding was observed for fractions enriched for HHL and biological activity of MB02 and EU-
Avastin is similar. A potential effect on immunogenicity cannot be excluded but the clinical data do not 
indicate an issue with immunogenicity. Absolute quantitation of the amino acid substitution revealed a 
low substitution level. Overall, it is concluded that the substitution does not preclude biosimilarity.   
Minor differences in distribution of charge variants are evident between MB02 and EU-Avastin. Overall, 
the differences are small, and characterisation of the individual peaks did not corroborate any 
significant differences between MB02 and EU-Avastin. An impact on clinical performance is unlikely. 
The distribution of the glycoforms (HILIC-UHPLC-FLR analyses) differs between MB02 and EU-Avastin. 
It is unlikely that these differences have an impact on immunogenicity. Considering the mechanism of 
action of bevacizumab and that MB02 and EU-Avastin show similar Fab- and Fc-related biological 
activities including mannose receptor binding, these differences are not expected to impact clinical 
performance and hence, do not preclude similarity. The clinical PK, efficacy and safety data from the 
pivotal studies support these conclusions. 
Compared to EU-Avastin no new size variants are observed for MB02 by the different techniques 
applied. SEC-HPLC shows a higher purity of MB02 and a lower aggregate content. Reduced CE-SDS 
reveals a slightly higher content of HC+LC for MB02 associated with lower levels of NGHC. On the 
Assessment report

contrary, under non-reducing conditions CE-SDS for MB02 a lower IgG content and higher levels of a 
HHL fragment are detected. In addition, the content of LC and LMW variants is slightly increased for 
MB02 when analysed by non-reducing CE-SDS. Analytical ultracentrifugation also reveals a slightly 
higher monomer content for MB02. No obvious differences between MB02 and EU-Avastin were noted 
by SDS-PAGE (reduced, non-reduced) and DLS. A higher purity (lower level of aggregates, higher 
monomer/HC+LC content) as observed by SE-HPLC, CE-SDS reduced, and svAUC does not preclude 
similarity. As discussed above, the higher level of the HHL fragment is not expected to impact efficacy. 
Overall, MB02 and EU-Avastin are considered similar with regard to size variants/purity. 
A broader range of activity is observed for MB02 in the cell-based reporter gene assay. However, it 
should be noted that the Applicant identified one out-of-trend result for EU-Avastin that was excluded 
from the analysis. In addition, comparable activity of MB02 and EU-Avastin was demonstrated in the 
other VEGF binding and bioassays. 
Compared to EU-Avastin, MB02 shows a slightly higher relative binding affinity to FcRI. However, the 
difference is small and the KD is highly comparable for MB02 and EU-Avastin. 
When analysed by AlphaLISA, relative binding to both FcRIII V and F variant differed between MB02 
and EU-Avastin. The difference in binding could be correlated to the different levels of G0 present in 
MB02 and EU-Avastin. A noticeable difference in binding or affinity between MB02 and the reference 
product was not detected with an orthogonal method (i.e. SPR). Taking into account that ADCC is not a 
mechanism of action for bevacizumab and absence of ADCC activity has been demonstrated for MB02 
and Avastin it is agreed that these differences are not clinically relevant. 
Comparative forced degradation studies were conducted to further demonstrate similarity of MB02 and 
EU-Avastin (one lot each of MB02, EU-Avastin, and US-Avastin were included). Using a set of stability 
indicating analytical methods including additional characterisation methods, similar degradation profiles 
and kinetics were observed for MB02 and the reference product under thermal, mechanical, low/high 
pH, and light stress. Overall, the presented stress stability data support the conclusion of similarity. 
In summary, the presented analytical data support the claim for biosimilarity between the proposed 
biosimilar MB02 and the reference product EU-Avastin. Minor analytical differences have been 
appropriately assessed and justified by the Applicant with regard to their potential impact on clinical 
performance of the product. The results are summarised in the following table.

Post approval change management protocol(s)  
A PACMP covering an intended change of the active substance manufacturing process has been 
submitted and is considered acceptable (see also characterisation section above).  
Adventitious agents 
Overall, the risk of contamination of MB02 with adventitious agents is considered low. The Applicant 
implemented multiple complementing measures to ensure product safety with regard to non-viral and 
viral adventitious agents. The measures include selection of materials, testing of cell banks and 
process intermediates, testing of microbial attributes at release, and implementation and validation of 
dedicated virus clearance steps and steps contributing to virus reduction:  
•  MB02 is manufactured from a CHO cell line without materials of direct animal or human origin. 
Based on the information provided the risk with regard to TSE or viral contamination is low. 
• 
The production cell line, the MCB, as well as the WCB have been manufactured without using 
materials of direct animal or human origin. The cell banks have been tested for the absence of 
adventitious viruses and microbial contamination. 
•  Each unprocessed harvest is routinely tested for the absence of adventitious viruses and 
mycoplasma. 
•  Endotoxin levels and bioburden/sterility are adequately controlled throughout the 
manufacturing process and at active substance and finished product release. 
•  Robust and effective overall virus clearance by five orthogonal manufacturing process steps 
has been demonstrated using validated down-scaled models. The manufacturing process 
includes two dedicated virus clearance steps that are effective against enveloped and non-
enveloped viruses.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
Assessment report

uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
The dossier includes a PACMP to support a future change of the fed batch step of the active substance 
manufacturing process, which is considered acceptable. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no 
impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, which pertain to the below aspects and are put 
forward and agreed as recommendations for future quality development.  
•  To re-evaluate a number of active substance and finished product specification limits based on at 
least 30 commercial batches.  
•  To implement a process specific HCP ELISA method.  
•  To present the final study report on leachables/elemental impurities testing when the respective 
study is finalized. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1.  The active substance and finished product specification limits should be re-evaluated after at 
least 30 batches of commercial batches have been manufactured. 
2.  The process specific HCP ELISA should be implemented. 
3.  The final results of the ongoing leachables/elemental impurities study should be provided. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to all soluble 
forms of human VEGF, neutralising its biological activity and acting as an anti-neoplastic agent (ATC 
code L01XC07). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology  
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The Applicant conducted an extensive in vitro programme to test biosimilarity between MB02 DP and 
the EU reference medicinal product Avastin. These studies were submitted in Module 3 of this MAA; 
Assessment report  
EMA/197736/2021  
Page 30/125 
 
 
 
 
hence, the corresponding assessment can be found in the quality assessment report and in section 
2.2.4. No non-clinical in vivo pharmacology studies were conducted, which is acceptable. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
No safety pharmacology studies have been conducted. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies have been conducted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No stand-alone pharmacokinetics studies were submitted. However, toxicokinetics endpoints were 
included in the conducted cynomolgus monkey repeated dose toxicity study (BEVZ92-NC-01).  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
No single dose toxicity study was submitted. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The Applicant conducted a 28-day repeated dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys (study 
BEVZ92-NC-01). 
The Applicant studied the toxicity of the investigational product in comparison to the comparator EU-
Avastin and a NaCl vehicle group. Per treatment, male and female cynomolgus monkeys were used at 
group sizes of only three animals each. The experimental setup of this study is illustrated in the Table 
below: 
An earlier version of Oyavas was used for this study, namely BEVZ92. This  study is presented as a 
supportive study in the MB02 marketing authorization application. 
No relevant differences between BEVZ92 and EU Avastin were observed in mortality, clinical signs, 
body weights, ophthalmology, electrocardiography, haematology, clinical chemistry, urine analysis, 
organ weights, macroscopic and microscopic findings. However, no statistical analyses were applied to 
compare the means of the assessed parameters. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197736/2021  
Page 31/125 
 
 
 
 
 
The toxicokinetic investigations that were included in study BEVZ92-NC-01 (AUC0-72h, Cmax, Tmax, RAAUC, 
RACmax and Frel) generally indicate that BEVZ92 and EU Avastin had a comparable toxicokinetic profile. 
This was especially demonstrated for e.g. AUC and Cmax, whereas Tmax values were compromised by 
high inter-individual variability so that statements on biosimilarity are not possible for this endpoint. 
No other toxicology studies were conducted, which is acceptable.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or 
distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, Oyavas is not expected to pose a risk to 
the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
One in vivo BEVZ92-NC-01 study was submitted in Module 4 of this MAA. All bio-comparability in vitro 
assays were submitted in Module 3; hence, their assessment can be found in the quality assessment 
section 2.2.4. 
No dedicated pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted, which is acceptable according to the 
EMA/CHMP guidelines on biosimilar products (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1, 
EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010).  
The submitted 28 day repeated dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys (study BEVZ92-NC-01) 
showed no relevant differences between BEVZ92 and EU Avastin in mortality, clinical signs, body 
weights, ophthalmology, electrocardiography, haematology, clinical chemistry, urine analysis, organ 
weights, macroscopic and microscopic findings. Consequently, the study suggests biosimilarity of 
BEVZ92 and EU Avastin. In addition, the small group size and occasionally high inter-individual 
variability make the study unreliable in terms of demonstrating biosimilarity. Therefore, the results of 
this study should only be regarded as supplementary data, but not as pivotal approach to test 
biosimilarity between both bevacizumab substances. 
No other toxicology studies were conducted, which is acceptable and in line with relevant EMA 
guidelines (e.g. EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1). 
In accordance with the EMA “Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing 
biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues” 
EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1, specific studies on genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive 
and developmental toxicity, and local tolerance have not been submitted. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
The in vitro studies are presented in Module 3 and thus, the non-clinical assessment focusses on one in 
vivo study conducted to fulfil regulatory requirements for non-EU regions. The results of the 
cynomolgus monkey repeated dose toxicity study (BEVZ92-NC-01) appear to demonstrate biosimilarity 
between BEVZ92 (an earlier version of MB02) and EU Avastin. No concerns are raised on this study 
since it is only considered supportive. 
The submitted non-clinical data are considered adequate to support biosimilarity of MB02 and the 
reference product.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK was characterized in healthy subjects in three clinical studies. The pivotal study MB02-A-02-
17 was a randomised, double-blind, three-arm, single 3 mg/kg dose, parallel study comparing the 
pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity of MB02, US-licensed Avastin and EU-approved Avastin 
in healthy male volunteers, conducted at two sites in the United Kingdom. 
PK evaluation is further supplemented with data from two single-dose PK/ immunogenicity studies in 
healthy volunteers (MB02-A-04-18 and MB02-A-05-18).  
o  A phase I, single-dose pharmacokinetics study conducted in Germany with 114 healthy volunteers, 
comparing MB02 to EU Avastin and US Avastin (MB02-A-05-18) with a study design similar to 
the study MB02-A-02-17 to support FDA filing. 
o  A phase I, single-dose comparative pharmacokinetics study was conducted in Japan with 48 
healthy volunteers comparing MB02 to EU Avastin (MB02-A-04-18) to support PMDA filing.  
Note: A phase I comparative pharmacokinetics study in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer 
(BEVZ92-A-01-13) was performed as part of the clinical development program oMB02.   Only safety 
results from this study are described in the dossier since a drug product different from the to-be-
marketed product was used.

Study MB02-A-02-17 - Pivotal Pharmacokinetics 
A total of 114 subjects were randomized to one of three treatment arms in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a 
single 3 mg/kg dose of either MB02, US-licensed Avastin and EU-approved Avastin, and 113 subjects 
completed the study. The study was performed between 15 November 2017 (date of first informed 
consent) and 29 May 2019 (date of final poststudy observation) at two sites in the UK.  
The population consisted of healthy male subjects aged between 18 and 55 years, inclusive, with a 
body mass index between 18.5 and 29.9 kg/m2, inclusive. 51.8% of subjects had a body weight ≥60.0 
to <77.5 kg and 47.4% had a body weight ≥77.5 to <95.0 kg. The majority of subjects were 
White/Caucasian (95; 83.3%). 
Data of all subjects who entered the study were included in the PK, safety and immunogenicity 
analyses. The PK population comprised all 114 subjects. PK parameters (other than Cmax and tmax) 
from 1 subject (administered US Avastin) were not included in the summary and inferential statistics 
due to the subject having an incomplete, and thus unrepresentative, PK profile. 
Doses of 3 mg/kg MB02 (Batch #17A043), US Avastin (Batch #3155155 and #3240772) and EU 
Avastin (Batch B8027H01 and B8034H02) were administered as a slow intravenous (IV) infusion, (over 
approximately 90 minutes). The total duration of trial participation for each subject (from screening 
through to the final visit) was max. 19 weeks. 
Blood sampling for PK was performed pre-dose, and at hour 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 24, day 3, 4, 5, 6, 
7, 8, 10, 14, 21, 28, 42, 56, 78 and day 100 post-dose.  
Immunogenicity samples were collected at pre-dose (D-1) and days 14, 28, 56 and 78.  
The primary PK parameter endpoints were maximum observed serum concentration (Cmax) and 
area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero extrapolated to infinity [AUC(0-
∞)] for bevacizumab.  
The secondary PK endpoints included area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to the 
time of last quantifiable concentration (AUC(0-t)), time of observed maximum serum concentration 
(tmax), apparent serum terminal elimination half-life (t1/2), and total body clearance of drug after IV 
administration (CL). 
PK parameters were derived by using standard non-compartmental methods. 
Statistical methods:  
MB02 was considered to be bioequivalent to US Avastin and EU Avastin if the 90% confidence intervals 
(CIs) for the ratios of MB02 relative to US Avastin and EU Avastin were completely contained within 
the interval 0.80 to 1.25 for AUC(0-∞) and Cmax. The PK parameters (AUC[0-∞], AUC[0-t], and 
Cmax) were log transformed (base e) prior to analysis and were analysed using an ANCOVA model. 
The model included treatment as a fixed effect and body weight as a covariate. 
An additional sensitivity analysis was also performed using the same methodology as the primary 
analysis but using the protein-adjusted PK parameters as the response variables to assess the impact 
of the actual protein content on the study results. 
The protein-adjusted analyses were derived by dividing each parameter, AUC(0-∞), AUC(0-t) 
measured in (h*ng/mL), and Cmax measured in (ng/mL), by the actual protein content of the product 
batch in (mg/mL). This kind of analysis delivers AUC(0-∞) in (h*ng/mL)/(mg/mL), AUC(0-t) in 
(h*ng/mL)/(mg/mL) and Cmax in (ng/mL)/(mg/mL) which are not the actual area under the plasma

The 90% CI for the geometric mean ratio for the primary parameters AUC(0-∞), and Cmax, as well as 
for AUC(0-t), were fully contained within the predefined equivalence limits of 0.80 to 1.25, and 
therefore demonstrated similarity between MB02 and EU Avastin, and EU and US Avastin for all 
parameters.  
For one subject in the MB02- and EU Avastin treatment arm each, bevacizumab pre-dose 
concentrations were detected. Nevertheless, values were only slightly above LLOQ, below 5% of Cmax, 
and were included in descriptive statistics and PK analysis. 
In general, as assessed by the geometric CV%, low between-subject variability was observed for 
AUC(0-t) and AUC(0-∞), and moderate between-subject variability for Cmax was noted for all 
treatment arms, with values ranging from 14.2% to 16.9%, 15.2% to 17.8% and 21.9 to 25.3%, 
respectively.

In addition, the secondary endpoints were in support of PK similarity. The median Tmax was slightly 
longer with EU-Avastin compared to MB02: 3h (arithmetic mean: 3.70h) vs. 2.51h (arithmetic mean: 
5.27 h), respectively. For US Avastin the median Tmax was at 4 hours after start of infusion. The 
majority of subjects experienced Cmax within 6 hours after the start of infusion.  
A prolonged Tmax of up to 12 hours was reported in several subjects receiving MB02 and EU-Avastin 
(7 subjects and 8 subjects, respectively), with one subject in the MB02 arm of the study not reaching 
Cmax until approximately 72 hours post-infusion.  
After reaching Cmax, observed serum concentrations declined in a biphasic manner with a slow 
terminal elimination phase. Similar geometric mean (%CV) elimination half-lives (t1/2) of 451 
(14.4%), 437 (15.5%) and 449 (19.3%) hours were determined for MB02, US and EU Avastin 
respectively. The elimination rate constants were similar. 
Sensitivity analysis: 
Due to variability in the actual protein content between the study drugs and study drug batches, which 
had the potential to influence the study results, protein-adjusted sensitivity analyses for AUC(0-∞), 
AUC(0-t), and Cmax were also conducted.

Pharmacokinetic Population 
The additionally performed sensitivity analysis correcting for actual protein content confirmed 
pharmacokinetic similarity, showing no statistically significant difference, with point estimates close to 
“1”.  
Upon request, bioequivalence assessment on protein-unadjusted PK parameters was performed, 
including the actual protein in the model as a nested parameter of treatment. The ratios of the 
geometric means and CIs for MB02 vs EU-Avastin support bioequivalence, with values of 0.892 
(90%CI 0.837 to 0.950), 0.885 (90%CI 0.829 to 0.946) and 0.897 (90%CI 0.818 to 0.984) for AUC0-
inf, AUC0-t and Cmax, respectively.  
In general, as assessed from the geometric CV%, between-subject variability remained similar 
following protein adjustment compared to the unadjusted AUCs and Cmax. 
The sensitivity analyses performed of MB02 vs US-Avastin as well as the comparison of EU- vs. US-
Avastin demonstrated biosimilarity in the primary endpoints AUC and Cmax as well. Nevertheless, even 
in the protein corrected analysis, Cmax was statistically significantly different, and the upper 90% CI 
close to the acceptance limit: 1.12 (1.02, 1.22). 
Study MB02-A-05-18: 
The design, conduct and analysis of study MB02-A-05-18 was identical to that of study MB02-A-02-
17, except that is was conducted in Germany. The applicant has clarified that during the execution of 
Study MB02-A-02-17, a difference in the protein concentration of the vials used was identified. 
Considering the possible impact of these differences to achieve bioequivalence between the three 
products MB02, EU-approved Avastin and US-licensed Avastin, a new clinical study with the same 
design was initiated in order to avoid any delay in the regulatory strategy planned for registration of 
MB02 in the EU and the US.  
The study was performed between 17 September 2019 and 17 March 2020 in Germany. The analysis 
of bevacizumab concentrations was performed in the UK. 
A total of 114 subjects were randomized to one of 3 treatment arms in a 1:1:1 ratio, and 113 subjects 
completed the study. The population consisted of healthy male subjects aged between 18 and 55 
years, inclusive, with a body mass index between 18.5 and 29.9 kg/m2. In each treatment arm, 42.1% 
of subjects had a body weight ≥60.0 to <77.5 kg and 57.9% had a body weight ≥77.5 to <95.0 kg. 
The majority of subjects were White (108; 94.7%).

458 hours (19.08 days) and 444 hours (18.5 days), respectively. The secondary endpoints were in 
support of PK similarity.  
Overall, the PK was comparable between MB02 and EU Avastin. 
Note: The statistical comparison of MB02 vs. US Avastin and EU Avastin vs. US Avastin could also

Study MB02-A-04-18: 
With the exception of the lack of an US-Avastin treatment arm, the design, conduct and analysis for 
this study is similar to that described for the pivotal study MB02-A-02-17 with some differences: there 
was only one primary endpoint (AUC0-inf) and the duration of safety follow up was shorter (70 days 
compared to 100 days). 
A total of 48 subjects were randomized following 1:1 ratio and stratified into 2 groups based on body 
weight (≥50 to <67 kg, and ≥67 to <100 kg respectively). The study was double-blinded. 
The study population consisted of Japanese healthy male subjects between 20 and 55 years of age, 
inclusive, with a BMI ≥18.5 to ≤28 kg/m2, inclusive, and a BW between ≥50 and ≤100 kg, inclusive. 
24 subjects (50%) were included in the MB02- and 24 subjects (50%) included in EU Avastin 
treatment arm. The mean age and BMI were 28.3 years and 22.54 kg/m2 and 28.5 years and 23.33 
kg/m2 for MB02 and EU Avastin treatment arms, respectively. The mean demographic parameters 
were comparable between treatment arms. 
The study was performed between 31 August 2019 (first subject visit) and 27 December 2019 (last 
subject completed) at one study center in Japan. Bioanalytical analysis was performed in the UK. 
49 subjects were enrolled and randomized and 48 subjects were assigned to a treatment sequence and 
dosed. One subject was enrolled and randomized in the study to EU Avastin but not dosed as the 
subject was withdrawn himself prior to dosing. All dosed subjects completed the study. 
Doses of 3 mg/kg MB02 (Batch #19A010) and Avastin sourced from the EU (Batch #N7261H05) were 
administered as a slow 90-minute i.v. infusion.

Doses of MB02 and EU-approved Avastin to Japanese Healthy Male Subjects 
The serum bevacizumab concentration versus time profiles following IV infusion administration was 
similar for MB02 and EU Avastin treatments, which declined slowly in a biphasic manner with resultant 
geometric mean t1/2 values of 430 hours (18 days) and 450 hours (18.75 days), respectively. 
Overall, the statistical analysis showed similarity regarding PK parameters between MB02 and EU 
Avastin in the Japanese population.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No clinical pharmacodynamic studies have been performed with MB02. No validated PD markers 
considered relevant to predicting efficacy of bevacizumab in patients exist. Therefore, no PD markers 
were included in the PK studies MB02-A-02-17, MB02-A-04-18, MB02-A-05-18. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic properties of MB02 were compared with both EU- and US-sourced bevacizumab 
(Avastin) in a pivotal phase I study in healthy male subjects (MB02-A-02-17), following a 3 mg/kg 
body weight single IV infusion. The study design is considered appropriate to sensitively detect 
potential PK differences between MB02 and Avastin.  
In support of a global marketing authorisation, comparison with the US-licensed product (US Avastin) 
was also undertaken. The data generated using EU Avastin are used in support of the MAA while the 
data generated using US Avastin are presented as supportive data, only.   
A parallel-group design was chosen due to the long half-life of bevacizumab of approximately 20 days, 
and the potential of ADA response, as recommended in respective EMA guidance. The selected 
sampling time points are able to reflect absorption, tmax and elimination period. The sampling 
Assessment report  
EMA/197736/2021  
Page 43/125 
 
 
 
 
 
duration of 100 days covers about 5 half-lives of bevacizumab, which is acceptable. For none of the 
subjects, %AUCext was >20%, demonstrating that samples were taken for a sufficient time period. 
The selected 3 mg/kg dose is lower than approved doses of Avastin. Nevertheless, studies with Avastin 
showed that PK was linear at doses ranging from 1 to 20 mg/kg, and the lower dose level was selected 
based upon the dosages used in published studies of bevacizumab, which is acceptable, also taking 
into account ethical reasons and safety aspects of the healthy volunteers´ population. 
No new pharmacodynamic data have been submitted in this MAA. Validated PD markers considered 
relevant for predicting efficacy of bevacizumab in patients do not exist. Thus, no PD markers were 
included in the PK study MB02-A-02-17 or supportive studies MB02-A-04-18 and MB02-A-05-18.  
Similarity between MB02 and EU Avastin was demonstrated, as the 90% CI for the geometric LS 
means ratios of protein-unadjusted AUCs and Cmax parameters were fully contained within the 
predefined bioequivalence limits of 0.80 to 1.25. The point estimates for AUC and Cmax were 1.16 and 
1.12, respectively, with an upper limit of the 90% CI of 1.22 for all three parameters, suggesting slight 
overexposure. In addition, the secondary endpoints were in support of PK similarity. The statistical 
comparison of MB02 vs. US Avastin did not demonstrate bioequivalence in terms of protein-unadjusted 
AUCs and Cmax ratios. The 90% CI of geometric least squares (LS) means ratios were not fully 
contained within the bioequivalence limits, with the upper bound of the CI exceeding the 1.25 limit for 
all 3 parameters, AUC 0-inf, AUC0-t and Cmax: The GLSM ratio of both, AUC0-inf and AUC0-t, was 
1.23 (90% CI 1.16, 1.31), and of Cmax 1.28 (90% CI 1.18, 1.39); for the latter parameter, even the 
point estimate crossed the upper CI limit.  
The statistical comparison of EU-Avastin vs. US-Avastin demonstrated biosimilarity, but a statistically 
significant difference was observed for Cmax (1.14 [1.18, 1.39]).Primary endpoint results showed a 
statistically significant difference, as “1” was not included in the GM ratio. In line with EMA guidance, a 
point estimate or substantive part of the confidence interval lying towards the extremes of the 
acceptance criteria requires further discussion. This includes instances where unity is excluded from 
the 90% CI. Specifically, results should be explained and justified in the context of evidence for 
similarity coming from other comparative studies/analyses in the development programme.  
Although the protein content of each batch of MB02, US- and EU-Avastin was within the specified 
range, variability existed in the actual protein content between batches. Subjects in the US and EU 
Avastin arms thus received an approximately 12% - 14% lower bevacizumab dose than subjects in the 
MB02 arm.  
The additional sensitivity analysis correcting for actual protein content confirmed pharmacokinetic 
similarity, showing no statistically significant differences, with point estimates close to “unity”. 
Although the sensitivity analysis is seen with some caution, results regarding PK similarity seem 
reassuring. A bioequivalence assessment on protein-unadjusted PK parameters was also performed 
post-hoc including the actual protein in the model as a nested parameter of treatment. The point 
estimates for AUC0-inf, AUC0-t and Cmax were 0.892, 0.885 and 0.897, respectively, with an upper 
limit of the 90% CI excluding “1” for all three parameters. This suggests slight underexposure, which is 
explained by the unbalanced strata in the nested model (29 vs 9 subjects) and the magnitude of the 
differences, which could lead to an inability to estimate the model parameters due to a lack of 
variability in the protein content. 
A list of the clinical and bioanalytical facilities involved in the MB02-A-02-17 study, which have been 
inspected by an EU inspectorate, the WHO or another competent authority, was submitted with the 
D120 responses. The results in both Phase I units, Covance Clinical Research Unit Ltd, Leeds, UK, and 
PAREXEL International, Harrow, UK, were without critical GCP findings.  
PK sampling in the target population is generally encouraged as providing supportive evidence (see 
Guideline on Similar Biological Medicinal Products Containing Monoclonal Antibodies –Non-clinical and 
Assessment report  
EMA/197736/2021  
Page 44/125 
 
 
 
 
Clinical Issues; EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). The applicant did not perform any comparative PK 
evaluation in the efficacy/safety study MB02-C-02-17 in NSCLC patients.   
However, the Applicant has satisfactorily justified the lack of comparative PK data in patients as the PK 
similarity was conducted in the most homogeneous and sensitive population to detect any possible 
differences between the biosimilar and the RMPs, and comprised three clinical trials involving 276 
healthy male subjects. The inter-subject variability was generally low (<25%). The role of target-
mediated clearance was also discussed, with the applicant providing supporting literature data. In the 
absence of target mediated clearance, elimination by intracellular catabolism after fluid phase 
endocytosis is the major pathway for mAb clearance and FcRn-mediated recycling underlies the 
prolonged elimination half-lives (approximately 25 days) and linear pharmacokinetics of such 
antibodies (Tabrizi et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2008). According to the most recent population PK model 
for bevacizumab in cancer patients, clearance is affected by body weight, serum albumin levels and 
baseline alkaline phosphatase but not tumour burden (Han et al., 2016a). The data generated from the 
PK studies conducted in healthy male volunteers as part of the comparability exercise support the 
notion that MB02 and EU-Avastin are eliminated at similar rates and are thus likely to be cleared via 
similar routes. It is agreed that there is no evidence for target-mediated clearance of bevacizumab. 
A repeated dose bioequivalence study compared PK, safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of the 
biosimilar candidate and Avastin in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.  
Two further PK studies for US FDA and Japan approval were presented. In the single-dose study 
MB02-A-05-18, MB02 is compared to EU- and US Avastin in 114 subjects. In study MB02-A-04-18, 
MB02 is compared with EU Avastin in 48 healthy Japanese subjects. Similarity between MB02 and EU 
Avastin was demonstrated in study MB02-A-05-18. The ratio of geometric least squares mean for 
AUC0-inf was 1.07 (90% CI: [1.00, 1.14]) and for Cmax was 1.06 (90% CI: [0.976, 1.16]). The 90% 
CIs were fully contained within the predefined equivalence limits of 0.80 to 1.25. The secondary 
endpoints were in support of PK similarity. Results from study MB02-A-04-18 showed equivalence 
between MB02 and EU Avastin following a single 3 mg/kg dose administered as a 90-minute IV 
infusion in healthy Japanese male subjects. The 90% CIs ratios were fully contained within the pre-
defined equivalence limits of 0.80 to 1.25 for the primary endpoint AUC(0-∞) and the secondary 
endpoints Cmax and AUC(0-t).  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pivotal PK study MB02-A-02-17 in healthy volunteers and the two supportive studies MB02-A-04-
18 and MB02-A-05-18 demonstrated similarity of the pharmacokinetics of MB02 and EU Avastin, based 
on the primary PK parameters. The protein-corrected sensitivity analysis performed post-hoc supports 
the primary results as is the requested re-analysis for protein correction (including a term for the 
actual protein content of the product batch in the ANOVA model), therefore, biosimilarity on the PK 
level can be concluded.

Treatments 
The study treatment consisted of an initial administration of paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 IV over 3 hours, 
followed by carboplatin AUC6 IV over 15 to 60 minutes and then, immediately afterwards, either MB02 
or EU-Avastin was to be administered 15 mg/kg on Day 1 of each 21 cycle (-1/+3 days) until objective 
disease progression (DP) or other criteria for treatment discontinuation were met.  
MB02/Avastin plus chemotherapy was repeated every 3 weeks for 6 cycles unless there was evidence 
of disease progression or intolerance of the study treatment. After 6 cycles (i.e., at the start of Cycle 
7), subjects could have continued to receive MB02/Avastin monotherapy treatment every 3 weeks until 
evidence of DP or until unacceptable toxic effects developed. The study duration was 52 weeks. After 
Week 52, all subjects (including those randomized to Avastin during the study) were offered the 
opportunity to continue receiving biosimilar MB02 monotherapy until DP, unacceptable toxicity, lost to 
follow-up, withdrawal of consent, initiation of any new treatment, or death. 
The treatment doses and schedules are according to the labelling for Avastin, Paclitaxel and 
Carboplatin. Dose modifications for both the MB02/Avastin and chemotherapy were not allowed until 
the Week 18 assessment.  
If a subject discontinued MB02/Avastin treatment before completing 6 cycles of therapy and before the 
primary endpoint at Week 18, the subject was discontinued from study treatment and proceeded to 
End-of-Treatment Visit. 
Tumour Assessments  
Tumor assessments were performed using CT and/or MRI of the chest, upper abdomen, and any other 
involved regions; the same method of assessment used at Screening was used at all subsequent time 
points.  
Tumour response was assessed by the IRC using the RECIST version 1.1 criteria to evaluate ORR. 
Disease status, PFS, and OS was evaluated by investigators.  
Schedule for Tumour Assessment 
Baseline assessment was performed up to 28 days before the start of study treatment and ideally as 
closely as possible to the start of study treatment; it was to include all areas known for possible 
metastases. Tumour assessments were performed at intervals of 6 weeks, from Cycle 1 Day 1 until the 
end of Cycle 6 (i.e., 18 weeks after first study drug administration); after Cycle 6, tumour assessments 
will be performed at intervals of 9 weeks until evidence of disease progression and/or the start of new 
antitumour treatment, death, or Week 52 (End-of-Study Visit), whichever occurs first. Additional 
tumour assessments were made at any time if the investigator considered this to be clinically 
indicated. Tumour measurements will also be performed during the Week 52 End-of-Study Visit if not 
done within the previous 4 weeks. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate equivalent efficacy of MB02 and EU-Avastin 
when used in combination with paclitaxel/carboplatin as measured by the objective response rate 
(ORR) as assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST; version 1.1). 
The secondary objectives of the study were as follows: 
• To assess progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) at Week 52 compared with those 
of Avastin. Duration of overall response (DOR) time to overall response (Time to OR) and observation 
time (OT) will also be analysed at Week 52 of the study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197736/2021  
Page 48/125 
 
 
 
 
• To evaluate the safety profile of MB02 compared with Avastin as per National Cancer Institute-
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE; version 4.03). 
• To compare the potential immunogenicity of MB02 and Avastin assessed through determination of 
ADAs. 
The comparison of the safety profile and immunogenicity of MB02 and EU-Avastin are discussed in 
section 2.6. Clinical safety. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
•  Objective response rate (ORR) was assigned for a subject if the subject displayed either 
complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST version 1.1 at Week 18. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
•  Progression free survival (PFS) defined as the time from randomization to subsequent 
confirmed progression per RECIST version 1.1, or death (whichever occurs first). 
•  Overall survival (OS) defined as the time from randomization to subsequent death. 
•  Duration of overall response (DOR) is the time from date of the first documentation of 
objective tumour response (CR or PR) to the first documentation of PD, or to death due to any 
cause in the absence of documented PD. 
•  Duration of observation time (OT) on the study is the time from date of randomization until 
final follow-up or death. 
•  Time to overall response (Time to OR) is the time from date of randomization until the 
date of the first documentation of objective tumour response (CR or PR). 
Randomisation 
Subjects (i.e., the unique subject ID consisting of centre ID and subject ID) were randomly allocated 
(1:1 ratio) to treatment according to a pre-specified blocked randomization scheme. Randomization 
was stratified by sex (male/female), smoking status (smoker/non-smoker), disease diagnosis (newly 
diagnosed/recurrent disease) and stage (Stage IIIB/Stage IV). 
Blinding (masking) 
The pharmacist at each study site and a specific clinical team from the Clinical Research Organization 
and the Sponsor was unblinded to treatment assigned. Subjects as well as investigators, all other 
study staff, laboratories and the rest of the Clinical Research Organization and Sponsor team will 
remain blinded to treatment assignment up to Week 52. The blind for a specific subject was broken by 
the investigator (emergency code breaking) only if the investigator considered the information 
indispensable to the safety of the subject. 
All subjects whose treatment was unblinded by the investigator (break blind option, emergency code 
breaking) while on the study was withdrawn at the moment of unblinding, with the reason for 
unblinding given as the reason for discontinuation from the study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197736/2021  
Page 49/125 
 
 
 
 
The main analysis at Week 18 was carried out by an unblinded study team independent from the 
blinded study team. Upon and after the analysis and reporting of the Week 18 unblinded data, the 
blinded study team continued to remain blinded. 
Statistical methods 
Primary endpoint 
Objective response rate (ORR): OR will be assigned for subjects if they experience either CR or PR per 
RECIST v1.1 at Week 18, as assessed by independent review. This assessment will be carried out by 
an independent radiology review committee (IRC). 
Analysis sets 
• 
The intention to treat (ITT) analysis set consists of all randomized subjects and subjects are 
analysed according to the randomized treatment. 
• 
The modified intention to treat (mITT) analysis set consists of all randomized subjects who 
were treated with investigational medicinal product (IMP) and had measurable disease at 
screening as determined by central radiological review.  
• 
The per protocol set (PPS) consists of all subjects in the mITT set who completed at least the 
first 6 cycles of IMP and chemotherapy, or who discontinued IMP or chemotherapy after 
completing at least 4 cycles of IMP and chemotherapy due to reasons allowed per protocol; 
and for whom no major protocol deviations affecting efficacy occurred up to and including 
Week 18. Subjects from the PPS will be analysed according to the actual treatment received. 
The determination of equivalence is based on the Intention to Treat (ITT) set. Per protocol set (PPS) is 
used as a supportive set for evaluating sensitivity of the main analysis. Nevertheless, in the 
equivalence setting, the ITT and the PPS have equal importance and for a robust interpretation have to 
lead to similar results (Points to consider on switching between superiority and non-inferiority 
CHMP/EWP/482/99). 
Analysis methods 
The ORR at Week 18 is calculated as the proportion of subjects with OR, and both the Risk Ratio (RR) 
of the ORRs (MB02/Avastin) and Risk Difference (RD) of the ORRs (MB02 minus Avastin) is analysed 
using the ITT, mITT and PP populations. As equivalence criterion on the primary endpoint a 2-sided 
90% CI for the respective summary measure were pre-planned to be compared to pre-defined 
equivalence margins and the broader 2-sided 95% CI are only provided in addition. Taking a 90% CI 
as primary instead of a 95% CI would increase the type I error rate to 10% and correspond to a two-
sided test at a significance level of 10%. Therefore, the 95% CI should be considered primary and the 
90% CI only supportive. Any subjects who discontinue study treatment before Week 18 were classed 
as non-responders in the final analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint (both for RR and RD analysis). 
Primary efficacy analysis 
For the EMA submission the difference in ORRs is used as the primary efficacy analysis. The statistical 
hypotheses associated with the primary analysis of ORR at Week 18 using risk difference are: 
• 
• 
 H0: (ORRMB02 - ORRAvastin ≤ -12%) or (ORRMB02 - ORRAvastin ≥ +12%) 
 H1: -12% < (ORRMB02 - ORRAvastin) < +12%, 
where ORRMB02 and ORRAvastin are the ORRs for MB02 and Avastin, respectively. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197736/2021  
Page 50/125 
 
 
 
 
The ORR estimate is adjusted for the randomization strata sex (male/female), smoking status 
(smoker/nonsmoker), disease diagnosis (newly diagnosed/recurrent disease) and stage (Stage 
IIIB/Stage IV) using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel estimate of the RD and corresponding 2-sided CIs. 
The Newcombe method is used for estimating the CIs. 
A sample size of 300 subjects in each treatment group would show that the two-sided 95% CI of the 
ORR difference between Avastin and MB02 lies within [-12%, 12%] with 82% power under the 
alternative that there is no difference in response rate assuming a response rate of 0.429 in both 
treatment arms. 
Supportive analyses of the primary endpoint 
1.  An equivalence analysis based on the RR with the equivalence margin [0.73, 1.36] is used to 
ascertain clinical equivalence of the primary efficacy endpoint. 
2.  In addition to ORR being assessed via an independent radiology review committee (IRC), ORR 
are assessed based on the investigator’s tumour assessment at week 18. 
Secondary efficacy analyses 
•  Overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS). 
Analyses will occur at Week 18 and Week 52; at each analysis, all subject data accrued during 
the study up to this point will be included to inform survival. The analysis is conducted in the 
ITT and PP populations for PFS and in the ITT population for OS. 
The Cox proportional hazards model is used to estimate the Hazard Ratio and its 90% CI of 
MB02 compared with Avastin. The main Cox proportional hazards model includes treatment 
group (reference: Avastin), with sex, smoking status, disease diagnosis, and disease stage as 
covariates. 
•  DOR, OT and Time to OR analyses will occur at Week 52, this analysis will be conducted on the 
ITT. 
Subgroup analyses 
Subgroup analyses are performed using the stratification covariates of sex (male/female), smoking 
status (smoker/non-smoker, disease diagnosis (newly diagnosed/recurrent disease) and disease stage 
(IIIB/IV). 
RR and RD estimate and the two-sided 90% CIs of ORR is restricted within each stratification factor on 
the ITT set (i.e. 16 analyses in total) and summarized within forest plots.

According to exclusion criteria (exclusion criterion 10), the patients with NSCLC harbouring activating 
EGFR mutations or ALK translocations were not included. The status of epidermal growth factor 
receptor and anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase was assessed locally according to the study 
protocol. 
The administration of prior systemic therapy (mostly adjuvant chemotherapy) and radiotherapy was 
balanced between the groups. 
The proportion of reported protocol deviations was balanced between the two arms. There was no 
remarkable difference in the type of protocol deviations between arms that would affect the similarity 
assessment.

Numbers analysed 
The ITT set consisted of 627 patients, the modified ITT set (mITT;  all randomized subjects who were 
treated with IMP and had measurable disease at screening) consisted of 598 patients and a total of 511 
patients met the criteria for PPS. The SAF consisted of 621 patients.  
Table 14: Study Populations (Randomized Subjects) 
The primary analysis of efficacy (RD and RR of ORR at week 18) was conducted on the ITT population 
(all randomised subjects), to evaluate therapeutic equivalence between MB02 and Avastin. The 
applicant has stated that efficacy evaluation in the protocol population set (PPS) and modified ITT was 
used for further support for clinical similarity. Of importance from a regulatory perspective, is that 
consistency could be shown. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary outcome 
ORR (by RECIST v1.1; assessed by an IRC) was conducted in the ITT population with supporting 
analyses on the PPS and mITT population.  
During the preparation of the additional requested analyses for the pivotal MB02-C-02-17 study, the 
applicant identified an issue in the specification of the strata for the Week 18 primary analysis.  
It was identified that the primary analysis modelling method implemented in SAS was incorrectly 
specified. 
The primary analysis was a comparison of Objective Response Rate (ORR) between Bevacizumab 
biosimilar (MB02) and Avastin, based on Overall Response (OR) as assessed by Independent 
Radiological Committee (IRC). 
Assessment report  
EMA/197736/2021  
Page 55/125 
 
 
 
 
 
The ORR estimate was planned to be adjusted for the randomization strata sex (male/female), 
smoking status (smoker/nonsmoker), disease diagnosis (newly diagnosed/recurrent disease) and -
disease stage (Stage IIIB/Stage IV) using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel estimate of the RD and 
corresponding 2-sided 90% CI. 
All Week 18 analyses have been re-run and the primary analyses of week 18 were replaced. The 
results of an independent review (Biostatistical Programming Independent Review Report) confirmed 
the reliability of the data, having identified no further issues of data reliability. 
Therapeutic equivalence was demonstrated in the ITT set, with the risk difference (RD) of ORR of -4.02 
and the 95% CI of the difference of the ORR between MB02 and Avastin (-11.76 to 3.71) falling within 
the equivalence margin of ±12%. In contrast to the ITT set, the primary endpoint was not met in the 
PPS population. The point estimate for the difference in the mITT population was -4.56 (95% CI: -
12.52 to 3.40) and the point estimate for the difference  in the PPS population was -4.27 (95% CI: -
12.92 to 4.38). Both 95% CIs were outside of the proposed -12% lower bound of the margin for 
equivalence.

To-Treat Population) 
Assessment report

Page 56/125 
 
 
 
 
 
In the ITT set, the number of subjects achieving OR was comparable between treatment groups (127 
subjects [40.3%; 95% CI: 34.9 to 46.0] in the MB02 group compared to 139 subjects [44.6%; 95% 
CI: 39.0 to 50.3] in the Avastin group) using non-responder imputation for missing values.  
Upon request by EMA, the primary endpoint ORR RD at Week 18 was also analysed for the analysis set 
including only those patients (from the ITT set) who completed Week 18 and had overall response 
(OR/BOR of CR, PR, SD or PD per RECIST v1.1) assessment. In selecting this population, the patients 
that experience response of NE and non-CR/non-PD due to non-evaluable target lesions at baseline, 
have been excluded. This analysis set thus has a similar intention as the pre-specified PPS, i.e. to 
compare efficacy in a set of patients that is more sensitive than the ITT to elucidate a differential 
treatment effect. This analysis set includes 406 patients (64.8% of the ITT set; 197 patients in the 
MB02 arm and 209 patients in the Avastin arm) for the ORR analysis. The ORR RD was -2.66 (95% CI: 
-11.91 to  6.59). The RD for the primary endpoint ORR by IRRC review at Week 18 remained entirely 
within the predefined equivalence margin of [-12%, +12%].

ITT, mITT and PPS populations from study MB02-C-02-17 
Post-hoc analyses 
Best objective response rate (BORR): 
A total of 332 (53.0%) subjects in the ITT population achieved BORR (CR or PR) based on IRC 
assessment. The number of subjects achieving BORR was slightly lower in the MB02 group compared 
with the Avastin group (160 subjects [50.8%; 95% CI: 45.1 to 56.4] in the MB02 group and 172 
subjects [55.1%; 95% CI: 49.4 to 60.7] in the Avastin group). BORR RD was -4.04 (95% CI: -11.86 
to 3.78).

Table 17: Best Overall Response Rate as determined by IRC assessment in study MB02-C-
02-17 (ITT population) 
Comparing the updated primary ORR RD analysis based on the ITT set (-4.02; 95% CI: -11.76, 3.71) 
and the requested analysis based on best overall response up to week 18, BORR RD, as shown above 
(-4.04; 95% CI: -11.86, 3.78), there was almost no difference between these two analyses, which is 
considered reassuring. 
ORR/BORR based on Multiple Imputation (MI) 
Upon request, ORR at Week 18 was additionally analysed implementing a multiple imputation process 
for imputation of missing at random (MAR) and missing not at random (MNAR) data based on sum of 
target diameters. 
An imputation of all data by a regression model for the missing sum of diameters was performed 
taking into account treatment and stratification factors and only including the distribution of data for 
which subjects either complete or withdraw for similar reasons. The outcome was forced to be imputed 
by an increase of the sum of diameters of 21% resulting in PD and, therefore, non-response for 
subjects that withdraw due to unacceptable toxicity, PD or death. Where a tumour response exists, it is 
used in the analysis regardless of whether target lesions (and thus sum of diameters) is present, 
otherwise the overall response is derived based on the imputed sum of diameters solely, per RECIST 
Assessment report  
EMA/197736/2021  
Page 58/125 
 
 
 
 
 
v1.1. Subjects that were randomised erroneously with no sum of diameter or tumour response data, a 
non-responder imputation is applied. 
In the ITT population, the ORR RD showed similarity at 95% CIs (-1.92; 95% CI: -10.02 to 6.19). In 
the mITT, the ORR difference was -2.77 (95% CI: -11.09 to 5.55) and showed also similar results.  
In contrast to the ITT, the ORR was not met in the PPS. 
As multiple imputation taking into account treatment and stratification factors was used for subjects 
without tumour response data or falling into the categories NonCR/NonPD or NE, additional analyses 
for this updated imputation process for the ITT set were presented.  
For subjects with no baseline sum of target diameter data, a non-missing baseline sum of target 
diameters was randomly selected from the pool of data available for subjects with the same 
stratification factors. Once a baseline sum of target diameters is imputed, the remainder of the 
imputation process as previously conducted was implemented.  
Table 18: Comparison of the OR results at Week 18 per IRRC assessment (ITT) –MI: 
adjustment for missing/NE 
An additional analysis was performed with a population set excluding only the patients for whom major 
protocol deviations affecting efficacy occurred up to and including Week 18 with non-responder and 
multiple imputation. The purpose of this analysis was to exclude those patients which had protocol 
violations that could have later resulted in biased efficacy outcomes, while preserving a larger sample 
size compared to the predefined PPS (thus resulting in more precision of the confidence intervals) 
through including those patients that had protocol violations unrelated to later efficacy outcome. This 
analysis included now 570 patients (91.0% of the ITT set), whereas the PPS included 511 patients 
(81.5% of the ITT set). No major imbalances in the individual reasons for exclusions between 
treatment arms were observed. The ORR RD under NR imputation was -6.04 (95% CI: -14.17 to  2.09) 
and under the preferred MI including adjustment for Missing/NE was -3.45 (95% CI: -12.04 to  5.13) 
at Week 18 by IRRC Review. Thus in the analysis set excluding only the patients for whom major 
protocol deviations affecting efficacy occurred up to and including Week 18, the results were close to 
the pre-specified equivalence margin of [-12%, 12%] using the preferred multiple imputation. 
There are 33 subjects (n=18 (5.8%) for Avastin arm and n=15 (4.8%) for the MB02 arm based on the 
ITT Set) with missing sum of target lesion data at Baseline, leading to an OR outcome of missing, NE, 
or Non-CR/Non-PD in 25 subjects at Week 18 because where a tumour response exists, it is used in 
analysis regardless of whether target lesions (and thus sum of diameters) is present. As the number of 
outcomes affected by this update are minimal (n = 13 (4.2%) for Avastin arm and n = 12 (3.8%) for 
the MB02 arm based on the ITT Set), also the effects of this updated imputation process are minimal: 
ORR Risk Difference (RD) -2.22% (95% CI: -10.54% to 6.10) at Week 18 by IRRC, BORR RD -2.89% 
(95% CI: -10.96% to 5.17%) at Week 18 by IRRC Review (Table 18).  
The RD of the ORR and BORR by IRRC review at Week 18 based on the ITT Set remained entirely 
within the equivalence margin of [-12%, +12%]. For the original and the updated information the 
point estimates of the RD shifted towards 0 when compared to the non-responder analysis, less for the 
new MI where also subjects without tumour response data or falling into the categories NonCR/NonPD 
or NE were imputed by MI instead of non-responder imputation. The number of missing values 
Assessment report  
EMA/197736/2021  
Page 59/125 
 
 
 
 
 
 
imputed by MI instead of non-responder imputation is higher for Avastin than MB02 comparing original 
and new MI (12 MB02 and 13 Avastin) making the RD a bit higher. 
Table 19: Tipping Point Analyses (ORR and BOR) at Week 18 (ITT) 
Tipping point analyses show no major changes in the number of subjects required to tip the response 
significantly in favour of Avastin (5 subject for ORR and 4 subjects for BOR) (Table 19).  
ORR by investigator assessment 
The results on the additional investigator assessment with non-responder imputation showed that the 
95% CIs were outside of the proposed -12% lower bound of the margin for equivalence in the ITT, and 
also in the PPS and mITT population. With multiple imputation the results on the investigator assessment 
were: ITT RD of -5.99 (95% CI: -14.08 to 2.10), mITT RD of -6.61 (95% CI: -14.92 to 1.69), and PPS 
RD  of  -8.63  (95%  CI:  -17.35  to  0.10).  It  should  be  noted  that  in  the  statistical  analysis  plan  the 
investigator assessment is considered supportive  analysis of the primary endpoint.  
Concordance rates 
The applicant provided data on concordance between the IRC and investigator assessments in ORR for 
the ITT population at the Week 18 time point. The concordance rate was quite low, with 62.5% and 
55.0% for ORR in the MB02 and Avastin groups, but comparable between the groups.  
ORR in ADA positive subjects 
During the evaluation procedure the applicant provided an overview of ORR in ADA positive and ADA 
negative subjects in the ITT set.  
Out of a total of 103 patients with positive TI-ADAs, 62 patients (60.2%) achieved OR at Week 18 (CR 
or PR; 28 patients [52.8%] in the MB02 arm and 34 [68.0%] in the Avastin arm) and 41 patients 
(39.8%) were non-responders (25 [47.2%] in the MB02 arm and 16 [32.0%] in the Avastin arm).  
This difference may be explained by the low sample sizes and the imbalance in number of subjects 
with no efficacy evaluation at Week 18 (“Not evaluable”, “Non CR/Non PD” and “Missing”; 18 subjects 
in total; 12 subjects in the MB02 arm [22.6%] and 6 subjects in the Avastin arm [12.0%]) Non-
response per se (stable disease [SD] and progression of disease [PD]) would lead to a similar number 
of non-responders: 13 subjects in the MB02 [24.6%] arm and 10 [20.0%] subjects in the Avastin arm. 
A total of 483 subjects were negative for ADAs (244 in the MB02 arm and 239 in the Avastin arm). Out 
of 483 subjects with negative ADAs, 191 subjects (39.5%) achieved OR at Week 18 (CR or PR; 92 
subjects [37.7%] in the MB02 arm and 99 subjects [41.4%] in the Avastin arm) and 292 subjects 
(60.5%) were considered non-responders (152 subjects [62.3%] in the MB02 arm and 140 subjects 
[58.6%] in the Avastin arm).  
The ORR at Week 18 per IRRC assessment in TI-ADA positive and ADA negative subjects were higher 
for the Avastin group than for MB02. 
Assessment report

Page 60/125 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, most subjects harboured low titres along the study period and titre levels between both 
treatment arms are highly similar. No relation between titre levels and ORR/BORR has been identified. 
The number of ADA positive patients was generally low, increases only slightly over weeks 6, 12 and 
18 and is comparable between treatment arms, whereas the difference in ORR gets more negative. 
Higher titre levels were not correlated with being a BORR non-responder.  
Secondary outcomes  
Progression free survival and Overall survival:  
Progression free survival was defined as the time from randomization to subsequent confirmed 
progression per RECIST version 1.1 or death (whichever occurred first). 
The Restricted Mean Survival Time [RMST] was defined as the area under the curve for the PFS and is 
estimated by the KM estimator for each treatment up to 52 weeks and the difference together with 
95% CIs reported. 
A total of 406 (64.8%) subjects had DP or died (205 subjects in the MB02 group and 201 subjects in 
the EU-Avastin group).  
For PFS in the ITT set, the hazard ratio (HR) was 1.200 with 95% CI (0.985, 1.462) and a p-value of 
0.0707. The median PFS was 43.00 weeks with 95% CI (36.14 to 45.14) for Avastin and 36.00 weeks 
with 95% CI (33.57, 36.86) for MB02. The analyses of PFS for ITT lead to a RMST of 37.29 weeks 
[95% CI: 36.14 to 45.14] for Avastin and a RMST of 36.0 weeks [95% CI: 33.00 to 36.43] for MB02. 
The difference in least square RMST between MB02 and Avastin for PFS ITT was -3.39 weeks (95% CI: 
-3.43 to -3.34). Note that the difference in least squares means are the difference in the group means 
after having controlled for covariates. Results were similar for mITT.  
Figure 4: RtQ – 2 Kaplan Meier Plot – PFS – ITT set 
The analysis of PFS in the mITT and PP populations showed similar results with those described in the 
primary ITT population. There was no significant difference in PFS between subjects treated with MB02 
and Avastin. 
For PFS in the PPS the HR was 1.233 with 95% CI (0.999 to 1.521) and a p-value of 0.0515. The 
median PFS was 45.00 weeks with 95% CI (36.29, 45.29) for Avastin and 36.00 weeks with 95% CI 
(33.43, 37.00) for MB02. The analyses of PFS for ITT lead to a RMST of 38.16 weeks [95% CI: 37.11 
to 39.22] for Avastin and a RMST of 34.23 weeks [95% CI: 33.34 to 35.12] for MB02. The difference

in least square RMST between MB02 and Avastin for PFS PPS was -2.42 weeks [95% CI: -2.47 to -
2.37].  
Overall survival was defined as the time from randomization to subsequent death.  
A total of 181 (28.9%) subjects died (91 and 90 subjects in the MB02 and EU-Avastin groups, 
respectively). Data for the remaining 446 (71.1%) subjects was censored (224 and 222 subjects in the 
MB02 and EU-Avastin groups, respectively).  
For OS in the ITT set, the HR was 1.107 with 95% CI (0.826, 1.483) with a p-value of 0.49165. The 
median OS for Avastin and MB02 could not be calculated as well as the corresponding 95% CIs for 
both treatment groups. In both treatment groups more than 50% of subjects were still alive at the end 
of the trial (see corresponding Kaplan-Meier plot, Figure 5), therefore, no median OS could be 
calculated. The difference in least square RMST between MB02 and Avastin for OS ITT was -3.11 weeks 
(95% CI: -3.17 to -3.05). 
Figure 5: RtQ – 3 Kaplan Meier Plot – OS- ITT set 
For OS in the PPS, the HR was 1.141 with 95% CI (0.835 to 1.560) and a p-value of 0.4085. The 
median OS provided by the Company for Avastin was 63.57 weeks. For MB02 the median OS could not 
be calculated, as well as the corresponding 95% CIs for both treatment groups. In both treatment 
groups more than 50% of subjects were still alive at the end of the trial, therefore, no median OS 
could be calculated. The difference in least square RMST between MB02 and Avastin for OS PPS was -
2.11 weeks [95% CI: -2.17 to -2.05]). 
OS results were consistent for mITT and PP Populations than those reported for the ITT set, with no 
notable difference between both treatment groups. 
The time period the patients were not treated before death was comparable between the treatment 
arms with a median of 23.14 weeks for both treatment arms.

(OT) and time to overall response (TOR) are summarized in the following tables:

Lesion assessment: 
Figure 6: Waterfall plot – Sum of Target Lesions – ITT Set 
The waterfall plots show a sharp peak at the beginning for MB02 and represents the subjects who 
discontinued due to greater severity of target lesions. A higher number of subjects discontinued due to 
PD in the Avastin treatment arm, but tumour burden was greater in the MB02 arm. All of these 
patients should have been imputed as non-responders in the primary analysis.

For the MMRM analyses of the sum of diameters in the ITT set a difference in LSMeans and 95% CI at 
Week 18 (MB02 minus Avastin) of -0.892 (-4.828, 3.044) was seen. 
For the MMRM analyses of the sum of diameters in the PPS a difference in LSMeans and 95% CI at 
Week 18 (MB02 minus Avastin) of -1.103 (-5.115, 2.910) was seen. 
All seen differences, also for the other time points (week 6 and week 12), are negative, but non-
significant. No monotone increase or decrease of the point estimate of the difference in the sum of 
diameters could be found. 
ORR at different weeks: 
ORR was also assessed by the IRC at Week 6 and Week 12 for ITT and PPS. 
Table 22: Risk difference (95% CI) for ORR based on IRRC assessment (ITT) 
The Applicant calculated the RD in ORR between the groups and corresponding 95% CIs at the time-
points (Week 6, Week 12 and Week 18) for non-responder imputation (NR) and the updated multiple 
imputation (MI) analysis. 
In the ITT set, the RD is positive at Week 6 (4.75 for NR and 5.02 for MI) and negative at Week 12 (-
3.48 for NR and -0.96 for MI) and even more at Week 18 (-4.02 for NR and -2.22 for MI). The 95% CI 
stays within the margins of [-12%, 12%] calculated for week 18.

Page 64/125 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 23: RtQ – 11 ORR RD and BORR RD at Week 6, 12 and 18 (PPS) 
In the PPS, the RD in ORR is positive at Week 6 estimating a higher efficacy of MB02 [6.14 (95% CI: -
1.88 to 14.16) for NR and 6.24 (95% CI:-1.81 to 14.29) for MI], but the estimates turn negative with 
Week 12 [-2.89 (95% CI: -11.46 to 5.68) for NR and -2.49 (95% CI: -11.09 to 6.11) for MI] and at 
Week 18 [-4.27 (95% CI: -12.92 to 4.38) for NR and -4.88 (95% CI: -13.55 to 3.80) for MI].  
BORR tends to follow a similar pattern over time. 
Discontinuations per cycle: 
The discontinuation pattern per cycle shows that non-responder  imputation favors the treatment arm 
with less missing data because Cycles 1-2 (18.1% vs 151%) and Cycles 3-4 (12.7% vs 9.6%) show a 
lower percentage of discontinuation for Avastin, whereas for Cycles 5-6 the Avastin arm has a higher 
percentage of discontinuation (8.6% vs 9.3%). This explains why for ITT there is a shift towards 0 and 
for the PPS there is a shift away from 0 when using MI instead of non-responder imputation (Table 30).

Table 24: Discontinuation per Cycle from Cycle 1 through Cycle 6 (ITT Set) 
Applicant provided the extent of study drug exposure for the PPS (Table 25). The mean duration of 
exposure to IMP was slightly lower in the MB02 arm: 201.2 days (SD 121.50) than in the Avastin arm: 
215.6 days (SD 121.64). A slightly lower number of cycles were administered to subjects in the MB02 
arm (mean of 10.1 cycles (SD 5.61)) compared with those in the Avastin arm (10.8 cycles (SD 5.65)). 
A slightly lower percentage of subjects received > 6 cycles of IMP in the MB02 arm (173 subjects; 
67.6%) than in the Avastin arm (180 subjects; 70.5%). The dose per subject was higher in the Avastin 
arm than in the MB02 arm. (Table 32). Similar differences were also seen in the SAF set. 
The 
Table 25: Study Drug Exposure (PPS) 
Similar differences are also seen in the SAF set (the difference between the ITT Set and the SAF Set 
was 6 subjects): The mean duration of exposure was slightly lower in the MB02 arm: 185.9 days (SD 
126.01) than in the Avastin arm: 203.9 days (SD 126.25). The mean number of cycles received per 
subject was slightly lower in the MB02 arm (9.4 cycles) than in the Avastin arm (10.3 cycles). A

slightly lower proportion of subjects received > 6 cycles of IMP in the MB02 (191 subjects; 61.4%) 
than in the Avastin arm (206 subjects; 66.5%).  
Number of chemotherapy cycles 
Table 26: RtQ – 10 Number of cycles of chemotherapy received (SAF and PPS) 
When comparing the number of chemotherapy cycles in the PPS set, more subjects of the MB02 arm 
were only exposed to chemotherapy cycles 1-2 (12.9% and 10.6% for MB02 and Avastin, respectively) 
and cycles 3-4 (11.3% and 9.4%) of chemotherapies, while more subjects from the Avastin arm 
received also the chemotherapy cycles 5-6 (75.8% and 80.0%). Similar differences were also seen in 
the SAF set.

Figure 7: Forest plot – RD – ITT Set 
Figure 8: Forest Plot – RD - PPS 
The forest plots show a consistency in treatment effect with negative point estimates except for the 
subgroups “Recurrent disease” and “Stage IIIB” where there are relatively low sample sizes and the 
corresponding 95% CIs are large covering also the other treatment effects.  
The point estimate of the subgroup “Recurrent disease” shows a higher response rate for MB02, but 
due to low sample size and as there is no medical explanation for a difference in treatment effect, this 
is likely to be attributed to chance.  
No relevant difference in the magnitude of the treatment effect could be found between subgroups.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical development programme to demonstrate biosimilarity in efficacy between MB02 and EU-
Avastin is based on one pivotal trial: MB02-C-02-17 was a multinational, multicentre, 2-armed, 
randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study in patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent stage 
IIIB/IV non-squamous NSCLC. Patients with non-squamous NSCLC are considered a relevant and 
sensitive population for the detection of potential differences between MB02 and the reference product. 
No other clinical studies were conducted to demonstrate similarity in efficacy between MB02 and EU 
Avastin in other indications approved for EU Avastin. The applicant provided a justification on the 
extrapolation to the other approved indications. 
The study was conducted in 16 countries and 93 study centres worldwide, including three EU Member 
States (Bulgaria, Greece and Hungary). The Applicant stated that the study was conducted in

and the applicable local regulatory requirements and laws. Two GCP inspections were conducted at two 
centres in Malaysia by the Medical Research and Ethics Committee (MREC). The respective inspection 
reports were provided; there were no critical GCP findings.  
627 patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either MB02 or EU-Avastin. Eligible randomized patients 
received either MB02 or EU-Avastin (15 mg/kg by IV infusion) in combination with carboplatin and 
paclitaxel (administered by IV infusion at intended doses of 6 mg/mL x min [AUC6] and 200 mg/m2, 
respectively) on Day 1 of a 21-day treatment cycle.  
Treatment cycles were repeated for up to 6 cycles, unless evidence of disease progression or other 
criteria for treatment discontinuation was observed. After 6 cycles, patients continued with 
monotherapy of MB02 or EU-Avastin until evidence of DP or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment was 
generally discontinued upon withdrawal of consent, death, lost to follow-up, protocol violation, 
termination by the sponsor or pregnancy.  
The study design was generally in line with previous EMA-scientific advices and considered adequately 
powered to demonstrate equivalence with the reference product. The treatment regimens for 
bevacizumab and chemotherapy are in line with Avastin labelling and respective guidance.  
Studied population 
The selected study population with newly diagnosed or recurrent Stage IIIB/IV non-squamous NSCLC 
with at least 6 months from previous neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment to randomization is considered 
sufficiently sensitive to identify a difference between the intended to be biosimilar MB02 and EU 
Avastin. The efficacy and safety profile of comparator treatment regimen with EU-Avastin in 
combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin approved for advanced non-squamous NSCLC is well 
understood. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria are based on those of the EU-Avastin reference trial and considered 
appropriate. The majority of patients had stage IV disease and were newly diagnosed patients. There 
were no findings in the medical history of clinical concern and no baseline signs/ symptoms of clinical 
concern prior to dosing. 
Sex (female/ male), smoking status (smoker/ non-smoker), disease diagnosis (newly diagnosed/ 
recurrent disease) and disease stage (stage IIIB/ IV) were used as stratification factors and are 
considered clinically relevant prognostic factors for the underlying disease. The stratification by gender 
and smoking status was endorsed during SA procedure by CHMP (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/370625/2017). 
Following this SA procedure additional stratification by disease diagnosis (newly diagnosed/recurrent 
disease) and by disease stage (IIIB/IV) was undertaken.  
Overall, baseline demographic and disease characteristics were well balanced between treatment arms. 
Efficacy endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population 
by Week 18. The per-protocol-set (PPS) population was used as a supportive population for evaluation 
of the sensitivity of the main analysis; in an equivalence setting, the PPS should lead to similar results 
for a robust interpretation. Secondary endpoints were PFS and OS by Week 18 and 52. Further 
endpoints were DOR, OT and Time to OR by Week 52. The primary and secondary endpoints were in 
line with the recommendation in the scientific advice and biosimilar guidelines (CHMP/437/04 Rev.1, 
EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev.1 and EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010).  
Based on the result of a meta-analysis of available RCTs of Avastin, an equivalence margin of ±12 % 
for the risk difference of ORR was defined, which is acceptable from a statistical point of view to ensure 
that in case of significance MB02 would be better than placebo. A margin of [-12%, +12%] 
corresponds to retaining approximately 20% of the conservative estimate of treatment effect sizes 
Assessment report  
EMA/197736/2021  
Page 73/125 
 
 
 
 
relative to chemotherapy for MB02. For clinical justification of the chosen equivalence margin, the 
reference was made to other biosimilar bevacizumab applications with even higher pre-specified 
equivalence margins of (±12.5%, ±13%). With a margin of [-13%, +13%], approximately 12% of the 
treatment effect of the reference product would be preserved. The Applicant argued that a difference in 
efficacy on ORR within the 13% margin would correspond to a change in PFS of 2.6 months, and such 
was not considered clinically meaningful in the treatment of advanced NSCLC according to FDA 
guidance (FDA-2011-D-0432, “Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 
Drugs and Biologics”). Use of this reference deals with a different situation, i.e. eligibility for 
accelerated approval of new drugs, where treatment differences based on PFS had to be substantial 
(e.g., 3 months or more) in a superiority trial. Ultimately, however, the actual confidence interval 
limits are most important when it comes to deciding on equivalence.  
The sample size calculations, randomisation and blinding procedures are considered adequately 
performed. 
In general, the Applicant´s development programme for demonstrating similarity between MB02 and 
EU-Avastin with respect to efficacy is considered adequate to support a MAA. The study design, study 
population, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and dose regimen were in line with the guidance on similar 
biological products and were in general complied with scientific advice obtained from the EMA. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The initial submission included the CSR data up to the Week 18 data cut-off (data cut-off: 03-July-
2019). The final analysis CSR (11-August-2020) was provided during the evaluation procedure and 
includes a full analysis of EOS Week 52 data.  
An unblinded study team independent from the blinded study team carried out the main analysis at 
Week 18. Tumour assessment is conducted by an independent central review for the primary analysis.  
The number of patients with stable disease (SD) and disease progression (PD) was largely comparable 
between treatment arms. Early discontinuation was observed in 114 (36.2%) subjects in the MB02 
group compared with 97 (31.1%) subjects in the EU Avastin group. The point estimate for the primary 
endpoint risk difference in ORR at week 18 in the ITT was -4.02 [95% CI: -11.76 to 3.71]. The two-
sided 95% CI was contained within the pre-specified equivalence margin of [-12%, 12%]. The ORR 
risk difference at week 18 for the PPS population was -4.27 and the two-sided 95% CI [-12.92 to 4.38] 
was not fully contained within the pre-specified equivalence margin of [-12%, 12%].  
Subjects who discontinued before week 18 were imputed as non-responders in both treatment arms, 
which would be anti-conservative in an equivalence setting. In addition, multiple imputation was 
performed by imputing all data by a regression model for the missing sum of diameters of target 
lesions. For certain discontinuation reasons associated with a negative outcome still non-responder 
imputation is performed making this a mixed and more realistic approach: In the ITT population, the 
ORR RD with the 95% CI remained within the 12% margins (-1.92; 95% CI: -10.02 to 6.19, MI not 
adjusted for missing/NE analysis) and similarly for the mITT, where the ORR difference was -2.77 
(95% CI: -11.09 to 5.55). For the PPS the ORR difference was -5.0, and the 95% CI was (-13.68 to 
3.68); the lower bound of the 95% CI exceeds the pre-defined equivalence margin of ±12% and also 
the argued 13% margin. 
An additional sensitivity analysis was requested in order to see if results for the ITT set (with MI taking 
into account treatment and stratification factors for patients without tumour response data or falling 
into the categories NonCR/NonPD or NE) would violate the equivalence margin. The number of missing 
values imputed by MI instead of non-responder imputation was higher for Avastin than for MB02 in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/197736/2021  
Page 74/125 
 
 
 
 
new MI analysis, making the ORR RD at week 18 slightly larger (-2.22), but the lower bound of the 
95% CI still lies within 12% (95% CI: -10.54 to  6.10). Thus, the ITT ORR results seem fairly robust to 
different imputations, and thus supporting equivalence of MB02 to Avastin within the predefined 
acceptance range.  
Following the final request from CHMP, the Applicant analysed a complete cases set, i.e. all patients of 
the ITT set that completed Week 18 and also had an OR of CR, PR, SD or PD according to RECIST v1.1, 
while excluding those subjects with non-evaluable disease and non- CR/non-PD response due to lack of 
target lesions at baseline. This analysis set has a similar intention as the pre-specified PPS, i.e. to 
assess differences in the treatments reducing the impact of unrelated factors on the outcome 
assessment, in this case based on the set of actual data that are generated over the course of 
treatment. The ORR RD was -2.66 (95% CI: -11.91 to 6.59) at Week 18 by IRRC Review, which is 
even fully contained within the predefined acceptance range of [-12%, +12%]. Though the 
interpretation of this result needs to be balanced against not fully respecting randomisation (as no PPS 
analysis does) and regarding multiplicity considering its post-hoc character, this analysis in a more 
sensitive model of completing patients supports similarity of MB02 and EU-Avastin with respect to the 
primary endpoint ORR. 
Another relevant analysis approximating the PPS was provided that excluded only those patients from 
the PPS who had major protocol deviations with potential later impact on efficacy. This means that 
compared to the initial PPS definition those patients were included where the reason for the protocol 
violation was considered unrelated to later treatment efficacy. The intent of this request was to 
increase the sample size, and thereby to increase the precision of the information on the difference 
between the treatments, as based on a decreased sample size the PPS has by definition the property 
to have less statistical power. This analysis included 570 patients (91.0% of the ITT set), whereas the 
PPS included 511 patients (81.5% of the ITT set). In the thereby defined analysis set and under the 
preferred analysis using multiple imputation adjusting for missing/NE, the ORR RD was -3.45 (95% CI 
-12.04 to 5.13), and thus while again having in mind its post-hoc character this analysis like the 
complete cases set demonstrated comparable efficacy between the two treatments. 
The discontinuation pattern per Cycle shows that non-responder imputation favors the treatment arm 
with less missing data because Cycles 1-2 and Cycles 3-4 show a lower percentage of discontinuation 
for Avastin (15.1% vs 18.1% and 9.6% vs 12.7%, for Avastin vs MB02, respectively), whereas for 
Cycles 5-6 the Avastin arm shows a higher percentage of discontinuation (9.3% vs 8.6%). This 
explains why for ITT there is a shift towards 0 and for the PPS there is a shift away from 0 when 
using MI instead of non-responder imputation.  
The difference in best ORR in ITT was -4.04 (95% CI: -11.86 to 3.78) with non-responder imputation. 
In the analyses of BORR RD based on the PP set, the lower limit of the 95% CI was below -12% and 
for the PP analysis below also -13%. In addition to an independent central review for the primary 
analysis, assessment by investigator´s analysis is made, which is supported. ORR by the additional 
investigator assessment had a point estimate for the difference of -7.01 with a 95% CI of (-14.79 to 
0.78) in the ITT analysis.  
Additional time points (week 6 and week 12) for ORR evaluation were considered as well. It was shown 
that the difference in ORR favours MB02 at Week 6 (4.75 for NR and 5.02 for MI), but favours Avastin 
at Week 12 (-3.48 for NR and -0.96 for MI) and Week 18 (-4.02 for NR and -2.22 for MI) in the ITT 
set. The 95% CIs lie within the equivalence margin of 12% (set for the week 18 assessment), and the 
directions are inconsistent over time. When analysing the PPS, the same pattern is confirmed. This 
course over time does not reveal a consistent picture, however does not amount either to a doubt on a 
differential treatment effect. Aware of the post-hoc character of some of the PP results and the 
unknown direction the lack of randomised comparison actually has on the results, the observation of 
Assessment report  
EMA/197736/2021  
Page 75/125 
 
 
 
 
an inconsistent pattern over time rather suggests a random component, respectively a component 
relating to effects imposed through study conduct (e.g. patient retainment/withdrawals).  
The percentage change in tumour burden from baseline (sum of the diameters of the target lesions) 
was investigated post-hoc, showing no significant difference between the treatments: For the ITT set 
the mean of the percentage change from baseline in tumour burden by 18 weeks was −26.64 for MB02 
and −25.75 for Avastin; the difference between the treatment groups was −0.892 (95% CI −4.828, 
3.044). Results were comparable by Week 6 and Week 12 with a difference of −0.976 and −1.133, 
respectively. Analysis of the %change in tumour burden assessed by the investigator was comparable 
with the IRRC assessment. Consistent with the ITT set results, the point estimates of the difference 
between MB02 and Avastin in the means of %change from baseline in tumour burden on the PPS were 
all negative, but fairly consistent between week 6, 12 and 18.  
Assessment of tumour burden on a continuous scale might be expected to increase sensitivity in terms 
of detecting potential treatment differences between a proposed biosimilar and its reference medicinal 
product and less prone to bias. All 95% CIs around the difference in means of %change in tumour 
burden show maintained response between [-5%, +5%] across both ITT and PPS. While it is critically 
noted that no margin was pre-specified for this endpoint, the extension of the confidence intervals for 
the difference in LSMeans is small in relation to the change from baseline, indicating good 
quantification of any differences between treatments, and thus supporting similarity of the two 
treatments across the analyses. Though in the lack of pre-specified equivalence margins this result 
cannot be used as a sole confirmatory result, it can be considered sensitive to detect differences 
between the treatments arms and adds supporting evidence of similarity. Therefore, tumour burden 
assessment strengthens the notion of similarity between MB02 and Avastin in the clinical assessment.  
In the subgroup analyses of the ITT population, a significant effect of the randomization strata sex, 
smoking, diagnosis and disease status on the outcome OR at week 18 was observed. However, no 
relevant differences between the MB02 and EU-Avastin treatment arms were observed in these factors. 
For the PPS, the mean duration of exposure to IMP was apparently slightly lower in the MB02 arm: 
201.2 days (SD 121.50) than in the Avastin arm: 215.6 days (SD 121.64). A slightly lower number of 
cycles was administered to subjects in the MB02 arm (mean of 10.1 cycles (SD 5.61)) compared with 
those in the Avastin arm (10.8 cycles (SD 5.65)). A slightly lower percentage of subjects received > 6 
cycles of IMP in the MB02 arm (173 subjects; 67.6%) than in the Avastin arm (180 subjects; 70.5%). 
The dose per subject was higher in the Avastin arm than in the MB02 arm. Similar differences are also 
seen in the SAF set.  
In addition, when comparing the number of different chemotherapy cycles, more subjects of the MB02 
arm were only exposed to chemotherapy cycles 1-2 (12.9% and 10.6% in the PPS set) and cycles 3-4 
(11.3% and 9.4% in the PPS set), while more subjects from the Avastin arm received also the 
chemotherapy cycles 5-6 (75.8% and 80.0% in the PPS set). Similar differences in exposure were also 
seen in the SAF set and this imbalance did not lead to a crossing of the acceptance range in the ITT 
analysis for the ORR RD. In summary, the slightly lower exposure and number of cycles of IMP and 
chemotherapy in the MB02 arm than in the Avastin arm, could partly have contributed to the observed 
tendency and favoured Avastin in efficacy endpoints. 
One reason that the 95% CIs were initially not contained within the equivalence margins for the PPS 
could be that the sample size was not adjusted for drop-outs, such that for the PPS the power to 
detect equivalence in case of similarity was lower. The calculated sample size to achieve 82% power 
was 300 subjects per treatment arm, 600 subjects in total. The ITT set consisted of 627 patients in 
total, 312 patients in the Avastin arm and 315 patients in the MB02 arm whereas the PP set had 511 
patients, 255 patients in the Avastin arm and 256 patients in the MB02 arm. This is in line with the 
Assessment report  
EMA/197736/2021  
Page 76/125 
 
 
 
 
requested results obtained for an extended PPS definition, where more narrow confidence intervals 
resulted extending only to around 12%.  
The secondary endpoints PFS and OS were evaluated at EOS Week 52. At EOS, the median PFS was 
36.43 weeks, and results were in favour of Avastin (36.0 weeks vs. 43.00 weeks with MB02 and 
Avastin, respectively). The PFS hazard ratio of the ITT set was 1.2 (95% CI: 0.985 to 1.462). The OS 
hazard ratio of the ITT was 1.107 (95% CI: 0.826 to 1.483). The PFS hazard ratio of the PPS was 
1.233 (95% CI: 0.999 to 1.521). The OS hazard ratio was 1.141 (95% CI: 0.835 to 1.560). Overall 
the time-to-event endpoints are numerically consistently favouring Avastin and thereby match the 
results of the primary endpoint ORR, but are both less sensitive and especially over the longer 
observation period dependent on external factors, and are per se considered less informative for 
conclusions on biosimilarity.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The primary analysis of the RD in ORR at week 18 in the ITT set meets the predefined equivalence 
margins. While for the PPS the RD in ORR had a lower bound of the 95% CI around 13%, several 
supplementary analyses on the primary endpoint ORR that approximate the intention of the pre-
specified PPS, showed comparable results between the treatment arms including the analysis of 
complete cases at week 18, and the analysis excluding only the patients who had major protocol 
deviations with potential impact on efficacy. Also, the ORR over time does not show a consistent 
pattern and could indicate a treatment effect seem implausible, but rather suggests a random element.  
The change in tumour burden showed comparable results between the treatments and adds supporting 
evidence of similarity. Other secondary efficacy endpoints were in consistency with the primary 
endpoint, with point estimates favouring EU Avastin. As the observations are made on the same 
individuals, characteristics related to patients can influence such consistency. A further observation is 
that due to a slightly lower exposure and number of cycles of IMP and chemotherapy in the MB02 arm, 
subjects in the Avastin arm have received more IMP and chemotherapy than in the MB02 arm. This 
could also explain parts of the observed trend towards higher efficacy of Avastin.  
In essence, all of the data provided upon request mitigate the previous concern, and while the 95% CI 
of the ORR RD analysis in the PPS extends somewhat beyond the predefined acceptance range, the 
provided respective supplementary analyses put these results into perspective. Overall, efficacy results 
support biosimilarity of MB02 and Avastin. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Pivotal comparative safety data was derived from two clinical studies: a comparative efficacy, safety 
and immunogenicity study in non-squamous NSCLC patients (MB02-C-02-17), and a single dose PK 
studies conducted in healthy volunteers in the EU (MB02-A-02-17). Safety evaluation is further 
supplemented by safety data from two single dose PK studies in healthy volunteers (MB02-A-04-18 
and MB02-A-05-18) and a phase I, open label, repeat-dose, parallel arm PK study in mCRC patients 
(BEVZ92-A-01-13).  
Study MB02-C-02-17 is a randomized, multicentre, multinational, double-blind study assessing the 
efficacy and safety of MB02 versus EU licensed Avastin, in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel 
Assessment report  
EMA/197736/2021  
Page 77/125 
 
 
 
 
for the treatment of subjects with stage IIIB/IV non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at 
93 study sites in 16 countries. 
MB02-A-02-17 is a randomised, double-blind, 3-arm, single dose, parallel study comparing the 
Pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity of MB02, US-licenced Avastin and EU-approved Avastin..  
Study MB02-A-05-18 is a supportive, single-dose, randomised, double-blind study with three parallel 
arms to compare PK, safety and immunogenicity of MB02, EU-approved Avastin and US-licensed 
Avastin in healthy male volunteers. The design, conduct and analysis for this study are identical to that 
of study MB02-A-02-17.  
Study MB02-A-04-18 is a supportive, single-dose, randomised, double-blind study with two parallel 
arms to compare PK, safety and immunogenicity of MB02 and EU-approved Avastin. Study designs and 
methodology of these three Phase 1 studies are located in the efficacy section and in more detail in the 
respective sections of the Clinical Report. 
Study BEVZ92-A-01-13 is a supportive, open label, repeat-dose, parallel arm PK study in 142 mCRC 
patients for a duration of up to 88 weeks (for BEVZ92) or 122 weeks (for Avastin), respectively. This 
study, which was the FIH trial for MB02 clinical development, used a drug product (referred to as 
BEVZ92) manufactured according to GMP standards by a contract manufacturer at a different site to 
the one used for the rest of clinical development. This study was therefore only assessed for safety 
aspects but not for PK or efficacy parameters. 
Both BEVZ92 and Avastin were to be administered at the initial dose of 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks, 
initially as a 90-minute intravenous (IV) infusion. If well tolerated, the next infusion was to be given 
over a 60-minute period; thereafter, these drugs were to be given over 30 minutes if well tolerated. 
Dose reduction of BEVZ92 or Avastin for adverse events (AEs) was not permitted, and therapy should 
be delayed or permanently discontinued if indicated. Special provisions were in place for AEs of 
interest, including hypertension, bleeding, proteinuria, thromboembolic events, posterior 
leukoencephalopathy, wound healing complications/dehiscence, gastrointestinal perforation, fistulae, 
and hypersensitivity reactions. FOLFOX (any) or FOLFIRI were to be chosen as per investigator criteria 
based on the hospital standard of care. The oxaliplatin dose was to be kept fixed at 85 mg/m2 in the 
first dose. Dose reductions were allowed for fluorouracil, oxaliplatin and irinotecan (depending the 
regimen selected – FOLFOX or FOLFIRI) according to the indications in the corresponding Summary of 
Product Characteristics. Each cycle of BEVZ92 and Avastin plus FOLFOX (any) or FOLFIRI was to be 
repeated every 2 weeks until progressive disease (PD), unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of 
consent. 
Four immunogenicity samples were to be collected: on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 5 and 8, and 12 months after 
first drug administration. 
Patient exposure 
To date, 1037 subjects received at least one dose of IMP: 621 non-squamous NSCLC patients, 140 
mCRC patients and 276 healthy volunteers.  
Pharmacokinetic study MB02-A-02-17: 
All 114 subjects enrolled in the study received the planned single dose of 3 mg/kg of MB02, US-Avastin 
or EU-Avastin, 38 subjects in each treatment arm. The total duration of trial participation for each 
subject (from Screening through to the final visit) was of 19 weeks. This dose is lower than the 
approved dose for Avastin, due to ethical concerns in a healthy study population and endoresed by the 
EMA Scientific advice earlier. Subjects in the US- and EU-Avastin arms received a dose of bevacizumab 
Assessment report  
EMA/197736/2021  
Page 78/125 
 
 
 
 
approximately 12% to 14% lower than that administered to subjects in the MB02 arm. Nevertheless, 
comparison of safety data in this study seems possible.  
Pharmacokinetic study MB02-A-05-18: 
114 subjects received study treatment (3 mg/kg single dose of MB02, US-Avastin or EU-Avastin, 38 
per treatment arm) and 113 subjects completed the study. One US Avastin subject withdrew before 
receiving any study treatment and was replaced. One EU Avastin subject received study treatment and 
was included in the safety and PK populations but was lost to follow-up on Day 56 and considered not 
to have completed the study. The total duration of clinical trial participation for all other subjects (from 
Screening through to the final visit) was approximately 19 weeks.  
Pharmacokinetic study MB02-A-04-18: 
All 48 subjects enrolled in the study received the planned single dose of 3 mg/kg of MB02 or EU-
Avastin, 24 subjects in each treatment arm. The total duration of trial participation for each subject 
(from Screening through to the final visit) was 14 weeks. 
Pharmacokinetic study BEVZ92-A-01-13: 
A total of 140 patients, 69 in the BEVZ92 arm and 71 in the Avastin arm, comprehend the All treated 
(AT) population in this study and received 2350 cycles of treatment. In the BEVZ92 arm, 1007 cycles 
were administered, with a maximum of 44 cycles per patient; in the Avastin arm, 1343 cycles were 
administered, with a maximum of 61 cycles per patient. The mean and median cumulative dose of 
BEVZ92 were 73.0 and 65.0 mg/kg, whereas the corresponding figures were 94.6 and 71.0 mg/kg, 
respectively, for Avastin. The number of patients that withdrew treatment during the first 6 cycles of 
treatment was higher in the BEVZ92 arm (n=14) than in the Avastin arm (n=9). Afterwards, the 
unbalance increased in subsequent cycles. Nevertheless, most patients received up to 10 cycles of 
BEVZ92 or Avastin (81% vs 86%, respectively), and the proportion of patients receiving up to 15 
cycles (67% and 72%), up to 20 cycles (33% and 47%) and, so on, was quite similar in the BEVZ92 or 
Avastin treatment groups.  
In the AT population, FOLFOX was the chemotherapy regimen chosen by investigators in 45 patients in 
each arm (thus comprising 65% of patients in the BEVZ92 arm and 63% of patients in the Avastin 
arm). Two other patients in the BEVZ92 arm were randomized to FOLFOX but they did not receive any 
study treatment. Conversely, FOLFIRI was chosen in 24 (35%) patients in the BEVZ92 arm and in 26 
(37%) patients in the Avastin arm.

Table 28: Extent of Exposure – AT Population 
Study MB02-C-02-17: 
As the safety profile of bevacizumab is well characterized, the sample size of the phase 3 study is 
considered acceptable to capture relevant safety signals. 
A total of 427 (68.1%) subjects had completed treatment up to Week 18.  
Subject demographics (gender, age, weight and height) were well balanced between treatment groups 
(see also 3.3.5). The mean duration of exposure was lower in the MB02 group (185.9 days compared 
with the Avastin group (203.9 days). Subjects in the MB02 group received a mean of 9.4 cycles of IMP 
compared with 10.3 cycles administered in the Avastin group. The mean amount of actual IMP doses 
administered was 1033.16 mg and the mean duration of infusion was 39.6 minutes, with no notable 
differences observed between groups. The frequency of subjects with IMP dose modifications (4 
subjects vs 3 subjects), IMP dose delays (136 subjects vs 133 subjects), and IMP stops/interruptions 
(3 subjects each) was similar between the MB02 and Avastin groups, respectively. While not 
statistically significant, the lower duration of exposure in MB02-treated subjects was likely attributed to 
the slightly higher rate of discontinuations up at week 18 in the MB02 group than in Avastin group, 
particularly in the first cycles. The proportion of subjects in each treatment group that did not 
complete/discontinued the treatment up to Week 18 was as follows: 33.01% (104 subjects) and 
28.84% (90 subjects) for the MB02 and EU-Avastin treatment groups, respectively. Other reasons, 
rather than toxicity, caused the imbalance at first cycles. After Week 18 (from cycle 7 to 18), 
discontinuations were slightly lower in the MB02 group, reverting the small imbalance observed during 
the first cycles.

A summary of administration of Carboplatin and Paclitaxel follows.  
Table 29: Study Drug Exposure (SAF Set) 
No notable differences were observed between IMP groups with regard to mean duration of exposure, 
total dose received, and duration of infusion. Likewise, the frequency of subjects with carboplatin or 
paclitaxel dose modifications, delays, and stops/interruptions was comparable between treatment 
groups.

The most commonly reported adverse events across clinical trials in patients receiving Avastin were 
hypertension, fatigue or asthenia, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. The most serious adverse reactions 
reported were gastrointestinal perforations, haemorrhage, including pulmonary 
haemorrhage/haemoptysis, which is more common in NSCLC patients and arterial thromboembolism.  
PK study MB02-A-02-17: 
Table 30: Overview of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events – Safety Population 
Overall, 77 subjects (67.5%) reported 230 TEAEs, of which 17 subjects (14.9%) reported 27 events 
considered possible, probable or definitely related to study treatment. A similar number of subjects 
reported TEAEs in each treatment arm of the study, and Fisher’s exact tests yielded p-values greater 
than 0.05 for all pairwise comparisons for the percentage of subjects with TEAEs. 
Common Adverse events: 
The most frequently reported TEAEs (incidence >10%) by Preferred Term were headache, (22 [19.3%] 
subjects reporting 29 TEAEs overall), upper respiratory tract infection (21 [18.4%] subjects reporting 
23 TEAEs overall) and back pain (12 [10.5%] subjects reporting 13 TEAEs overall).

The incidence and severity of TEAEs in PK study MB02-A-02-17 was comparable between MB02 and EU 
Avastin. The majority of TEAEs were considered mild in severity and were reported in a comparable 
number of subjects in the MB02, US-Avastin and EU-Avastin arm. The most frequently reported TEAEs 
Terms were headache (19.3%), upper respiratory tract infection, (18.4%), and back pain (10.5%), 
with slightly higher incidence in the EU Avastin arm compared to the MB02 arm for each of the terms. 
Study drug-related TEAEs: 
Table 33: Frequency of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (Possible, Probable, or Related 
to Study Drug) Reported by ≥5% of Subjects – Safety Population 
The number of TEAEs considered possible, probable or definitely related to the study drug was low (17; 
14.9% overall) and was comparable between treatment groups (6 subjects vs 8 subjects with MB02 
and EU Avastin, respectively). The majority of possibly related TEAEs were Grade 1 (mild) in severity.

PK study MB02-A-05-18: 
Table 34: Summary of TEAEs reported in study MB02-A-05-18 – Safety population 
Overall, 199 TEAEs were reported in 87 (76.3%) study subjects. In the MB02 arm of the study, 30 
subjects experienced at least one TEAE with a total of 60 TEAEs reported. In the EU-Avastin arm, 25 
subjects experienced at least one TEAE with a total of 72 TEAEs reported. In the US-Avastin arm, 32 
subjects experienced at least one TEAE with a total of 67 events. 
In terms of severity, the majority of TEAEs reported in the study were considered mild (149 of 199 
events; 46 of 60 events in the MB02 treatment arm, 48 of 72 events in the EU-Avastin treatment arm 
and 55 of 67 events in the US-Avastin treatment arm) or moderate (49 of 199 events; 14 of 60 events 
in the MB02 treatment arm, 23 of 72 events in the EU-Avastin treatment arm and 12 of 67 events in 
the US-Avastin treatment arm). Likewise, the majority of treatment-related TEAEs were considered 
mild in severity (13 of 14 events in the MB02 treatment arm, 19 of 22 events in the EU-Avastin 
treatment arm and 18 of 20 events in the US-Avastin treatment arm).TEAEs considered to be 
treatment-related (possibly, probably or definitely-related) were reported in 33 (28.9%) study subjects 
from all arms of the study. In the MB02 and EU-Avastin treatment arms, 21 subjects experienced a 
total of 36 treatment-related TEAEs (10 subjects/14 events and 11 subjects/22 events in the MB02 and 
EU-Avastin treatment arms, respectively).  
Only one severe TEAE was reported; a subject in the EU-Avastin treatment arm experienced an upper 
respiratory tract infection. This severe TEAE, which resolved by the end of the study, was not 
considered to be treatment-related by the Investigator and was not classified as a SAE. There were no 
deaths reported in this study.

PK study MB02-A-04-18: 
Table 35: Summary of TEAEs reported in study MB02-A-04-18 – Safety population 
An overall total of 47 TEAEs were reported by 20 of the 48 subjects participating in the study (41.7%). 
The incidence of TEAEs in the MB02 treatment group was slightly lower compared to the EU-Avastin 
treatment group (8 of 24 subjects [33.3%] and 12 of 24 subjects [50.0%] in the MB02 and EU-Avastin 
treatment groups, respectively). The number of TEAEs was comparable between the MB02 and EU-
Avastin treatment groups (22 and 25 events in the MB02 and EU-Avastin treatment groups, 
respectively). 
Of the 47 TEAEs reported, the majority were classified as mild (Grade 1) in severity (37 TEAEs; 20 and 
17 for the MB02 and EU-Avastin treatment groups, respectively). The remainder were classified as 
moderate (Grade 2) in severity (10 TEAEs; 2 and 10 for the MB02 and EU-Avastin treatment groups, 
respectively). No severe (Grade 3) TEAEs were reported in the study. 
Only 3 of the 47 reported TEAEs were considered to be treatment-related (possibly, probably or 
definitely-related). All 3 treatment-related TEAEs were observed in the EU-Avastin treatment group, 
with no treatment-related TEAEs observed in the MB02 treatment group. 
Of note, the number of TEAE was distinctly lower in study MB02-A-04-18 compared to the other PK 
studies in healthy volunteers which may be explained by differences in baseline characteristics (age, 
BMI) and a known trend towards  occasionally  lower  reporting  of  TEAEs  in  Asian  countries.  
Study BEVZ92-A-01-13: 
A summary of TEAEs reported during the study is displayed in Table 36.  
Assessment report  
EMA/197736/2021  
Page 86/125 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 36: Summary of TEAE – AT population 
All 71 patients in the EU-Avastin arm and 66 patients (96%) in the BEVZ92 arm experienced at least 
one TEAE. 
A similar number of TEAEs considered related to administration of IMP were reported in each treatment 
arm; 24 (35%) and 26 (37%) of patients experienced at least one TEAE considered related only to IMP 
administration in the BEVZ92 and EU-Avastin arms, respectively. 
The SOCs with the largest number of patients reporting TEAEs (≥ 50 patients for each SOC) were 
gastrointestinal disorders, general disorders and administration site conditions, nervous system 
disorders, blood and lymphatic system disorders, metabolism and nutrition disorders, infections and 
infestations and investigations. 
Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs were reported in similar proportions of patients in both arms (44 [64%] in the 
BEVZ92 arm and 49 [69%] in the EU-Avastin arm). The most common (> 20%) treatment related 
TEAEs were those commonly seen with chemotherapy, including diarrhoea, nausea, neutropenia, 
anaemia, vomiting, asthenia, fatigue, decreased appetite and abdominal pain and their incidence was 
similar in both treatment arms. Other events commonly described in patients treated with 
bevacizumab, such as hypertension, proteinuria, thrombocytopenia and bleeding, were also reported in 
similar proportion in both treatment arms. Finally, serious TEAEs were reported in 40 (29%) patients 
overall, 19 (28%) in the BEVZ92 arm and 21 (30%) in the EU-Avastin arm. Despite a larger number of 
Assessment report  
EMA/197736/2021

serious TEAEs in the EU-Avastin arm (56 compared to 34 in the BEVZ92 arm), there was no obvious 
pattern regarding the types of serious TEAEs in both arms. 
When TEAEs were analyzed according to an exposure-adjusted incidence rate to see if the nominal 
differences in exposure to study treatment have an influence on the incidence of TEAEs observed in 
each treatment arm (events per 100 patient months [PM]), the incidence of TEAEs was comparable 
and supported the previous analysis for TEAEs considering any causality. Similarly, no remarkable 
difference was observed in serious TEAEs based on the total exposure time – per 100 PM. 
Comparative analysis of the number of patients with particular AEs in the BEVZ92 and EU-Avastin arms 
of the study suggests a similar profile of AEs in the two treatment groups. The safety profiles were 
within expectations given the underlying disease and concomitant chemotherapy and consistent with 
the labelling information for Avastin 
The numbers of patients in study BEVZ92-A-01-13 that reported at least one TEAE, regardless of 
causality, in each treatment group is displayed by SOC in Table 37.

Table 38: Overall Summary of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (SAF Set) 
Common adverse events:  
The majority of the patients in this study had at least one TEAE (all causality). The subject incidence 
was balanced between treatment arms, 92.6% subjects in the MB02 group and 92.9% subjects in the 
Avastin group.  
The most common TEAEs (reported in ≥ 5% of subjects) were those commonly reported with the use of 
carboplatin/paclitaxel (e.g., alopecia, nausea, and neuropathy), as well as PTs related to 
myelosuppression (e.g., anaemia, leukopenia,  neutropenia and thrombocytopenia). Other TEAEs were 
those commonly reported with the use of bevacizumab (e.g., hypertension and proteinuria), and were 
similarly distributed between treatment groups.  
The most common TEAEs by preferred term (PT) were alopecia (51.2%) and anaemia (31.4%), with 
no considerable differences between treatment groups.

Alopecia (318 subjects [51.2%]; 155 subjects [49.8%] and 163 subjects [52.6%] in the MB02 and EU-
Avastin treatment groups, respectively), anaemia (168 subjects [27.1%]; 91 [29.3%] and 77 subjects 
[24.8%] in the MB02 and EU-Avastin treatment groups, respectively), and nausea (82 subjects 
[13.2%]; 41 [13.2%] subjects each in the MB02 and EU-Avastin treatment groups), were the most 
commonly reported TEAEs during combination therapy (up to Week 18). 
Between study Week 18 and Week 52 (i.e. the monotherapy period) the most commonly reported 
TEAEs were anaemia (65 subjects [10.5%]; 24 subjects [7.7%] in the MB02 and 41 subjects [13.2%] 
in the MB02 and EU-Avastin treatment groups, respectively), and thrombocytopenia (34 subjects

[5.5%]; 19 subjects [6.1%] and 15 subjects [4.8%] in the MB02 and EU-Avastin treatment groups, 
respectively). 
Severity of TEAEs:  
Table 41: Summary of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, by Maximum Severity (SAF Set) 
The most commonly Grade ≥3 reported events included anaemia (26 subjects [8.4%] in the MB02 
group and 21 subjects [6.8%] in the Avastin group) and neutropenia (16 subjects [5.1%] in the MB02 
group and 21 subjects [6.8%] in the Avastin group), followed by asthenia (14 subjects [4.5%] in the 
MB02 group and 11 subjects[3.5%] in the Avastin group) and thrombocytopenia (10 subjects [3.2%] 
in the MB02 group and 6 subjects [1.9%] in Avastin group).  
More patients experienced grade 3 or 4 TEAEs with MB02 compared to Avastin (39.9% vs 38.1%, 
respectively). Grade 5 TEAEs were generally low in incidence and comparable between treatment 
groups (6.4% versus 6.1%).  Of note, 3 fatal TEAEs were not classified as Grade 5 events (2 subjects 
with general physical health deterioration [Grade 2 and Grade 3] and one subject with dyspnoea 
[Grade 3]). The applicant provided a brief explanation and a table with all fatal AEs up to Week 52 not 
classified as Grade 5.  
A total of 576 (92.8%) subjects, who were treated with the study drug in study MB02-C-02-17, 
experienced at least 1 TEAE, with no statistical difference between treatment groups (p=0.89). 
Between treatment groups at each severity level, the distribution of events was similar. A total of 256 
(41.2%) subjects experienced a total of 540 TEAEs with a severity of Grade 3 or Grade 4 (131 [42.1%] 
in the MB02 group [271 events] and 125 [40.3%] in the Avastin group [269 events]). A total of 39 
subjects (6.3%) experienced a TEAE with a severity of Grade 5 (20 [6.4%] in the MB02 group and 19 
[6.1%] in the Avastin group).  
IMP-related TEAEs: 
The most commonly reported IMP-related TEAEs were hypertension (40 subjects [6.4%]; 19 subjects 
[6.1%] and 21 subjects [6.8%] in the MB02 and EU-Avastin treatment groups, respectively) and 
anaemia (33 subjects [5.3%]; 16 subjects [5.1%] and 17 subjects [5.5%] in the MB02 and EU-Avastin 
treatment groups, respectively). 
Assessment report

The most commonly reported Grade 3 or 4 IMP-related TEAEs reported were hypertension (12 subjects 
[3.9%]; 7 [2.3%] in the MB02 group and 5 [1.6%] in the Avastin group) and anaemia (9 subjects 
[2.9%]; 2 [0.6%] in the MB02 group and 7 [2.3%] in the Avastin group). For IMP-related TEAEs 
reported by ≥1% of subjects, Grade 5 PTs of haemoptysis (one event in the EU-Avastin treatment 
group) and pulmonary embolism (one event in the MB02 treatment group) were reported. 
No clear treatment group-related trends were observed for IMP-related TEAEs. In all cases, the risk 
difference between treatment groups in subjects reporting IMP-related TEAEs was <2%.

Study BEVZ92-A-01-13: 
All haemorrhagic and cardiovascular events were considered “Important Medical Events” as per the 
protocol for study BEVZ92-A-01-13. 
In relation to the SOC cardiac events, 17 TEAEs in this class were reported in 14 patients (6 in the 
BEVZ92 arm and 8 in the Avastin arm). However, none of these events were considered to be related 
to bevacizumab treatment. 
Overall, 33 (24%) of patients in the study reported at least one bleeding event (14 in the BEVZ92 arm 
and 19 in the Avastin arm). The most frequent bleeding event was epistaxis (7 [10%] in the BEVZ92 
arm and 11 [15%] in the Avastin arm) followed by gastrointestinal haemorrhage events (8% overall; 
mainly rectal, anal or haemorrhoidal). 
All bleeding events were graded 1–2 except for one event in the BEVZ92 arm (lower gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage) and two events in the Avastin arm (subdural haematoma and tumour haemorrhage) 
that were graded 3–4. 
Overall, the adjusted event rate per patient-month (0.0030 in the BEVZ92 arm and 0.0037 in the 
Avastin arm) was similar in both treatment groups. 
Study MB02-C-02-17 
Overall, the number, type, and severity of TEAEs of special interest was in alignment with the safety 
profile reported in the bevacizumab SmPC for this patient population. However, some events were 
reported as SUSARs, as discussed below. For all TEAEs of special interest, the difference in frequency 
between treatment groups of TEAEs reported was <5%. The most commonly reported TEAEs of special 
interest were identified by the searches for events associated with neutropenia and infections (191 
subjects [30.8%]). A total of 61 (9.8%) subjects experienced TEAEs associated with haemorrhage, 
pulmonary haemorrhage, and/or haemoptysis, with no observable risk difference between treatment 
groups with regard to subjects reporting TEAEs. Hypertension-related TEAEs were identified in 60 
(9.7%) subjects; proteinuria-related TEAEs were identified in 46 (7.4%) subjects, with no observable 
risk difference between treatment groups with regard to subjects reporting TEAEs. 
Treatment-related TEAEs of special interest occurring in >1% of subjects and with higher reports in 
MB02-treated subjects compared with Avastin-treated subjects included leukopenia (6 subjects in 
total; 1.0%), epistaxis (22 subjects in total; 3.5%) and haemoptysis (12 subjects in total; 1.9%). 
Treatment-related TEAEs occurring in >1% of subjects and with higher reports in Avastin-treated 
subjects compared with MB02-treated subjects included neutropenia (19 subjects in total; 3.1%) and 
proteinuria (31 subjects in total; 5.0%). Other treatment-related TEAEs occurring in >1% of subjects 
included hypertension (40 subjects in total; 6.4%) and pulmonary embolism (9 subjects in total; 
1.4%) and were reported in similar frequency in both treatment groups.

Serious adverse events and deaths 
PK study MB02-A-02-17: 
Serious TEAEs: A single subject reported an SAE. This subject was allocated to US Avastin and 
reported a Grade 3 (severe) TEAE of purpura, with no other symptoms on Day 82. Two weeks before, 
the subject had an upper respiratory tract infection. Clinical laboratory assessments were normal. No 
treatment was prescribed, and the event resolved without sequelae. The subject was negative for ADA 
and nAb at all timepoints. This SAE was unexpected and thus, the case was considered and expedited 
as a Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) as per regulatory reporting 
requirements. 
Deaths: There were no deaths reported in this study. 
PK study MB02-A-05-18: 
No deaths or other SAEs were reported in study MB02-A-05-18. 
PK study MB02-A-04-18: 
No deaths or other SAEs were reported in study MB02-A-04-18. 
Study BEVZ92-A-01-13: 
At the completion of study BEVZ92-A-01-13, a total of 37 deaths were reported in the AT (safety) 
population: 19 (28%) in the BEVZ92 arm and 18 (25%) in the Avastin arm. The majority of the deaths 
(24) were due to disease progression: 11 (16%) and 13 (18%) in the BEVZ92 and Avastin arms, 
respectively. The deaths due to disease progression reported in the study were well balanced between 
both treatment arms and are expected events in the study population. 
The remaining 13 patients (8 [10%] and 5 [6%] in the BEVZ92 and Avastin arms, respectively) 
experienced at least one serious TEAE with fatal outcome. 
Fatal events were considered related to any of the study treatments (bevacizumab, chemotherapy or 
both) in four patients (two in each treatment arm). Only in one patient in the Avastin arm the fatal 
events were considered to be related exclusively to bevacizumab by the investigator.  
The distribution of SAEs across the treatment arms by SOC were similar, as were the total number of 
patients reporting SAEs (19 [28%] in the BEVZ92 treatment arm and 21 [30%] in the Avastin arm). 
SAEs by PT that were reported in > 5% patients included intestinal obstruction (9%) in the BEVZ92 
group; and diarrhoea (7%), neutropenia (8%) and anaemia (6%) in the Avastin group. 
Most common treatment-related SAEs included neutropenia and diarrhoea (each one in one patient in 
the BEVZ92 arm and four patients in the Avastin arm), anaemia (in one patient in the BEVZ92 arm and 
three patients in the Avastin arm), leukopenia and sepsis (each one in two patients in the Avastin 
arm), and hypotension (in two patients in the Avastin arm). 
Three events merited attention: one asymptomatic thromboembolism in the right trunk of the 
pulmonary artery in a patient in the BEVZ92 group that was considered “probably related” to 
bevacizumab and was detected while the patient was undergoing a scheduled CT scan, which led to 
discontinuation of the study treatment; a superior vena cava thrombosis that was considered “possibly 
related” to Avastin and “possibly related” to FOLFOX and was ongoing at the time of patient withdrawal 
due to progression of the disease under study, and a large intestinal perforation (“transverse colon 
perforation”) in the Avastin arm, which led to a fatal outcome and was considered by the investigator 
to be “probably related” to Avastin and “not related” to FOLFOX.

Study MB02-C-02-17: 
Serious TEAEs: 
Through study Week 52, a total of 112 (18.0%) subjects experienced a total of 174 serious TEAEs 
during the study. No statistically significant difference (p=0.69) in serious TEAEs was observed 
between the MB02 (58 subjects [18.6%]; 88 events) and EU-Avastin (54 subjects [17.4%]; 86 events) 
treatment groups. No SAEs were reported during study drug infusion. 
A total of 66 (10.6%) subjects experienced study drug-related serious TEAEs during the study (33 
subjects in each treatment group); the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.99). Of these 
cases, 39 (6.3%) subjects experienced serious TEAEs related to MB02 (21 subjects [6.8%]) or EU-
Avastin (18 subjects [5.8%]). A total of 51 (8.2%) subjects experienced serious TEAEs related to 
carboplatin and/or paclitaxel (24 subjects [7.7%] in the MB02 group compared to 27 subjects [8.7%] 
in the EU-Avastin group).  
Table 43: Summary of Related Serious Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (SAF Set) 
The most common serious TEAEs were pneumonia (16 subjects [2.6%]), febrile neutropenia (11 
subjects [1.8%]), pulmonary embolism (10 subjects [1.6%]), and neutropenia (9 subjects [1.4%]). All 
other serious TEAEs were experienced by < 1% of subjects overall. The incidence of serious TEAEs 
observed between treatment groups was comparable, and no notable trends were observed in the 
reported PTs.  
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction: Study MB02-C-02-17: 
Among all TEAEs, 16 SUSARs were reported, 9 in the MB02 treatment group and 7 in the Avastin 
group.  
Per definition SUSARs are suspected to be related to the administration of the study drug, but 
unexpected as not being consistent with the applicable product information (i.e., investigators´ 
brochure for an unauthorized investigational medicinal product or SmPC for an authorized product).  
Following up on these cases, a detailed explanation of all SUSAR cases including patient narratives and 
information on the patients’ medical history and concomitant medication was provided. Thus it was 
demonstrated that all cases could be explained by one or more of the following: side effects of 
concomitant medication; confounding by medical history or underlying disease; additional data on 
Avastin from published literature or the EudraVigilance database where similar events were observed. 
Based on the provided evaluation it is concluded that no new safety signals or observable trends have

been identified in either treatment arm in the pivotal efficacy and safety study MB02-C-02-17 
compared with the known safety profile of Avastin.Deaths: Study MB02-C-02-17: 
A total of 47 (7.6%) fatal TEAEs were reported in study MB02-C-02-17, of which 23 (7.4%) occurred in 
subjects randomized to receive MB02 and 24 (7.7%) occurred in subjects randomized to receive EU-
Avastin. 
Of these 47 subjects, 25 (4.0%) reported fatal TEAEs in the SOC general and administration site 
conditions (13 subjects [4.2%] in the MB02 group and 12 subjects [3.9%] in the EU-Avastin group). 
No fatal TEAEs were reported during study drug infusion. The most commonly reported fatal TEAE was 
general physical health deterioration (disease progression), reported by 8 (2.6%) subjects in the MB02 
group and 11 (3.5%) subjects in the EU-Avastin group. 
Other fatal TEAEs experienced in more than one subject were sudden death (2 [0.6%] subjects in the 
MB02 treatment group (not fulfilling clinical definition). 
As summarized in Table 44, the fatal TEAE was considered related to any study drug in 12 subjects 
with no statistical significance between the groups (p=0.56); 7 subjects and 5 subjects in the MB02 
and EU-Avastin treatment groups, respectively. A total of 6 subjects had fatal TEAEs considered related 
to MB02 and three subjects had fatal TEAEs related to EU-Avastin.

Laboratory findings 
PK study MB02-A-02-17: 
Clinical laboratory evaluations: Five subjects (4.4%, one with MB02, one with US Avastin and three 
subjects with EU Avastin) experienced AEs related to out-of-range clinical laboratory evaluations. Most 
of them were increased hepatic enzyme, which were unlikely/ not related to study drug. The elevations 
in all 5 subjects were grade 1 or grade 2, transient and resolving without intervention by the next 
scheduled clinical laboratory evaluation.  
There were no apparent treatment or time-related differences or trends in mean clinical laboratory 
measurements during the study. Sporadic out-of-range values occurred for multiple subjects in 
evaluations of various clinical laboratory measurements but not considered clinically significant. 
Vital signs, ECG, and local tolerability: One subject (administered US Avastin) experienced a TEAE of 
pyrexia, which was considered Grade 1 (mild) and not related to the study drug by the Investigator. 
No other TEAEs related to vital signs measurements were reported. 
PK study MB02-A-05-18: 
All clinically significant changes reported in clinical laboratory assessments were considered by the 
Investigator to be resolved by the end of the study and none were considered related to study 
treatment. 
PK study MB02-A-04-18: 
Clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory assessment parameters were observed; however, 
these were transient, resolved without intervention, and no treatment arm-related trends were 
observed. 
Study BEVZ92-A-01-13: 
The majority of laboratory anomalies reported in study BEVZ92-A-01-13 were of grade 1 or 2 and the 
distribution of grade 3–4 abnormalities was similar between the BEVZ92 and Avastin study arms. The 
only grade 3–4 abnormalities reported in > 10% of patients were high uric acid (21 [30%] and 23 
[32%], respectively) and low neutrophil counts (16 [23%] and 21 [30%] in the MB02 and Avastin 
arms, respectively). 
Low total serum protein levels were reported in 37 (54%) patients in the BEVZ92 arm and 33 (46%) 
patients in the Avastin arm.  
Study MB02-C-02-17: 
Changes in the haematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, and coagulation parameters were those 
corresponding to the TEAEs reported under the SOCs investigations (alanine aminotransferase 
increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased and haemoglobin decreased), blood and lymphatic 
system disorders (anaemia, thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia), and renal disorders (proteinuria 
and protein urine), as the most representative. 
There were no apparent trends or remarkable differences between the treatment groups in mean 
baseline measurements or changes from baseline at each vist/cycle through the end of the study 
(Week 52) for any variable measured, including haematology, clinical chemistry, urinanalysis and 
coagulation variables.

12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters: ECG measurements are presented for Screening, 
Baseline, at Cycle 3, Cycle 5, Cycle 6, End of Treatment, and at End of Study There were no apparent 
trends or remarkable differences between the treatment groups in mean baseline measurements, 
numbers of subjects with abnormal clinically significant measurements, or changes from baseline to 
the worst grade or at each visit/cycle for any variable measured.  (mean heart rate, PR interval, QRS 
duration, QT interval, and QTcF interval). All abnormal ECG measurements that met criteria of an AE or 
SAE are discussed in the respective sections of this report.  
Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction: LVEF at Baseline and End-of-Treatment are presented as descriptive 
statistics by treatment group. At Baseline, mean (StD) LVEF measurements for 618 of 621 subjects in 
the SAF population were 63.1% (6.04). End-of-Treatment LVEF measurements of 62.4% (6.98) were 
observed for 365 of 621 subjects in the SAF population. No clinically significant differences were 
apparent between treatment groups. Measurements of LVEF that met criteria of an AE or SAE are 
discussed in the respective sections of this report. 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status: ECOG performance status is presented for 
Screening, Baseline, at Day 1 of each cycle, at the End-of-Treatment Visit, at additional follow-up 
visits, and at the End-of-Study Visit. All subjects entering the study were rated Grade 0 or 1 in ECOG 
status at baseline. A general worsening in ECOG status was observed as expected due to the disease 
outcome and was comparable between treatment groups. 
Clinical laboratory evaluation: 
Blood and Urine parameters: Changes in the haematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, and 
coagulation parameters were those corresponding to the TEAEs reported under the SOCs investigations 
(alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased and haemoglobin 
decreased), blood and lymphatic system disorders (anaemia, thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia), 
and renal disorders (proteinuria and protein urine), as the most representative. 
There were no apparent trends or remarkable differences between the treatment groups in mean 
baseline measurements or changes from baseline at each vist/cycle through the end of the study 
(Week 52) for any variable measured, including haematology, clinical chemistry, urinanalysis and 
coagulation variables. 
Other observations: 
12-Lead Electrocardiogram: There were no apparent trends or remarkable differences between the 
treatment groups in mean baseline measurements, numbers of subjects with abnormal clinically 
significant measurements, or changes from baseline to the worst grade or at each visit/cycle for any 
variable measured. 
Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction: No clinically significant differences were apparent between treatment 
groups. 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status: subjects entering the study were rated 
Grade 0 or 1 in ECOG status at baseline. A general worsening in ECOG status was observed as 
expected due to the disease outcome and was comparable between treatment groups. 
Safety in special populations 
The applicant has not conducted specific safety studies in special populations.  MB02 will therefore rely 
on the information available for the RMP, Avastin.

Immunological events 
Analytics: 
Immunogenicity assay validation 
Screening and confirmation assayTo obtain data with regards to the immunogenicity of MB02 and 
Avastin in the phase I study MB02-A-02-17, MB02-A-05-18, MB02-A-04-18 and the efficacy and safety 
study MB02-C-02-17, determination of ADAs was performed using an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) 
method validated with respect to sensitivity, specificity, intra- and inter-assay precision, and short- 
and long-term stability. Assay selectivity was shown in the presence of haemolysed and lipaemic 
matrix components. Drug tolerance was established in the presence of varying concentrations of MB02. 
To mitigate VEGF interference, samples were neutralised with VEGF Receptor 1 neutralisation buffer 
after the acid dissociation step.  
Calculation of the screening cut point followed recent recommendations (testing for normality, 
selection of non-parametric approach). Calculation of confirmatory cut point is in accordance with 
recent guidance. 
Neutralization assay 
The assay for determination of neutralising antibodies (nAbs) was comprehensively validated according 
to recent guidance. nAbs in the clinical Phase I studies and Phase III study were determined using 
assays validated with regard to sensitivity, selectivity, short- and long-term stability, inter- and intra-
assay precision, drug tolerance and interference. 
Haemolytic samples (10% haemolysis) were found to interfere with nAb determination in normal as 
well as in NSCLC human serum, thus potentially causing false positive results.  No hook effect was 
observed. 
Due to insufficient volumes of negative control pool and labelled reagents to complete new upcoming 
clinical studies (Covance studies 8412384 and 8412385, MB02-A-05-18, MB02-A-04-18 respectively), 
a partial re-validation was conducted. 
Pharmacokinetic Study MB02-A-02-17:  
Immunogenicity Sampling was performed at baseline, d14, 28, 56 and day 78. 
At the baseline visit (study Day -1), one subject in each of the MB02 and EU-Avastin treatment arms 
tested positive for ADA.  
Treatment-induced ADA were reported in both the MB02 and EU-Avastin arms of the study (2 subjects 
and 1 subject, respectively). The majority of positive tests for ADA were transient, occurring at a single 
time point with a low titre value.  
No discernible trend or correlation between ADA status and the measured values for PK parameters 
(AUC0-inf, Cmax and CL) could be observed for either the MB02 or EU-Avastin treatment arms. Those 
subjects who developed an ADA or nAb response did not report any treatment-emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs) related to infusion reactions or any TEAEs considered temporally associated with the 
development of ADA or nAbs. 
Pharmacokinetic Study MB02-A-05-18:  
Immunogenicity Sampling was performed at baseline, d14, 28, 56 and day 78. 
A total of 3 subjects (2.6%) tested positive for ADA at baseline (2 [5.2%] subjects in the MB02 
treatment group and 1 [2.6%] subject in the EU-Avastin treatment group). All three positive baseline 
Assessment report

samples were negative for NAb response and were low titre. One of the subjects in the MB02 
treatment group who was ADA positive at baseline showed a NAb response at study Day 78. 
Treatment-induced ADA (TI-ADA), defined as an ADA which developed following drug administration, 
were developed in a total of 35 (30.7%) subjects. The distribution of ADA positive subjects was similar 
between the MB02 and EU-Avastin treatment groups; 12 subjects (31.5%) and 14 subjects (36.8%) in 
the MB02 and the EU-Avastin treatment groups, respectively. The presence of TI-ADA was distinctly 
higher in this study than in all other clinical studies. Although the reasons for this observation could 
not be elucidated, similar incidences of TI-ADAs where observed between treatments arms within each 
individual study. Moreover, almost all ADAs were transient and appeared not to have effects on PK or 
safety.  
All subjects that were ADA positive in both the MB02 and EU-Avastin treatment groups exhibited a 
transient response, with only one subject (in the MB02 treatment group) showing a NAb response at a 
single timepoint (Day 78). 
No discernible trend or correlation between ADA status and the measured values for PK parameters 
(AUC0-inf, Cmax and CL) could be observed for either the MB02 or EU-Avastin treatment arms. 
Those subjects who developed an ADA or NAb response did not report any treatment-emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) related to infusion reactions or any TEAEs considered temporally associated 
with the development of ADA or NAbs. 
Pharmacokinetic Study MB02-A-04-18:  
The majority of study subjects tested negative for ADA at all timepoints. A total of two subjects tested 
positive for ADA at baseline, one in each treatment arm.  
Only one subject in the EU-Avastin treatment arm tested positive for treatment-induced ADA during 
the study. The positive result was transient. 
The subjects testing positive for ADA at baseline did not report any TEAEs related to infusion reactions.  
No discernible trend or correlation between ADA status and total clearance was observed. The 
incidence of ADA and NAb was not considered to have any effect on PK parameter estimates. 
Pharmacokinetic Study BEVZ92-A-01-13:  
Immunogenicity of BEVZ92 is not assessed. 
Study MB02-C-02-17: 
Through study Week 52, a total of 2811 samples have been analysed, corresponding to 621 subjects 
from the Safety population (311 and 310 for MB02 and EU-Avastin groups, respectively). 
Initially, an increased frequency of ADA positive baseline samples in the screening tier of the trial 
(17.4%) had been measured. This led to further investigations and new analyses with cut-points, 
which better reflected the disease matrix (NSCLC serum) but may still have included a certain level of 
false positives, thus leading to the relatively high number of ADA positive patients at baseline. 
However, it was shown that the observed ADA baseline levels are in line with historical data for 
bevacizumab across different patient populations. 
A total of 38 (6.1%) subjects tested positive for ADA at baseline (Cycle 1 prior to treatment), 16 
(5.1%) subjects in the MB02 group and 22 (7.1%) subjects in the EU-Avastin group. Among these 
positive baseline samples, 4 NAb positive responses were detected, all in the EU-Avastin group.  
The majority of subjects tested negative for ADA at all timepoints. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197736/2021  
Page 104/125 
 
 
 
 
A total of 103 subjects (16.6%) developed TI-ADA, defined as an ADA which developed in a subject 
who had tested negative for ADA at baseline. Similar proportions of subjects developed treatment-
induced ADA in the MB02 (53 subjects [17.0%]) and EU-Avastin (50 subjects [16.1%]) treatment 
groups, respectively. Most subjects positive for TI-ADA harboured low titres and the median titre in 
both treatment arms was observed to be similar. 
In both the MB02 and EU-Avastin treatment groups the majority of the TI-ADA positive subjects 
exhibited a transient response (for MB02, 50 of 53 subjects [94.3%]; for EU-Avastin 40 of 50 subjects 
[80.0%]). These transient responses generally occurred at a single timepoint or at two timepoints 
occurring less than 16 weeks apart. A small number of subjects demonstrated a persistent response (3 
of 53 subjects [5.7%] and 10 of 40 subjects [20.0%] in the MB02 and EU-Avastin treatment groups, 
respectively). 
Less than 5% of subjects tested positive for TI-NAb, 10 of 292 (3.2%) of subjects in the MB02 
treatment group and 13 of 297 subjects (4.2%) in the EU-Avastin treatment group.

Table 46: Summary of NAb incidence by treatment group (SAF Set)  
Of the 103 patients with TI-ADAs, 62 patients (60.2%) achieved ORR at Week 18 (CR or PR; 28 
[patients [52.8%] in the MB02 arm and 34 [68.0%] in the Avastin® arm) and 41 patients (39.8%) 
were non-responders (25 [47.2%] in the MB02 arm and 16 [32.0%] in the Avastin® arm). Although a 
difference in the number of patients achieving ORR between both treatment arms was observed, this 
difference was not statistically significant (RD -15.17, 95% CI: -32.82 to 3.48 treatment p-value 0.11) 
and it was overall concluded that the findings do not account for any differences in efficacy between 
the products. 
No discernible trend or correlation between ADA status and safety was seen. The presence of ADAs 
was apparently not associated with serious infusion-related reactions or anaphylactic reactions.

Discontinuation due to Adverse Events 
Pharmacokinetic Study MB02-A-02-17: No subject discontinued due to TEAEs. 
Pharmacokinetic studies MB02-A-04-18 and MB02-A-05-18: No subject discontinued due to AEs. 
Pharmacokinetic Study BEVZ92-A-01-13: 
A total of 19 patients (13 in the BEVZ92 arm and six in the Avastin arm) reported a total of 21 (14 and 
seven in the BEVZ92 and Avastin arms, respectively) TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of 
study treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197736/2021  
Page 106/125 
 
 
 
 
 
The TEAEs leading to discontinuation were considered related to one of the study drugs in 15 patients 
(10 in the BEVZ92 arm and five in the Avastin arm) and discontinuation was attributed to bevacizumab 
alone or bevacizumab in combination with FOLFOX/FOLFIRI in 9 patients (5 in the BEVZ92 arm and 
four in the Avastin arm). 
The bevacizumab-related TEAEs leading to discontinuation in the BEVZ92 arm were wound bleeding, 
wound dehiscence, aortic thrombosis and aortic dissection (all considered non-serious), along with one 
case of serious embolism. In the Avastin arm, hypertension, portal vein thrombosis and abdominal 
abscess (all considered non-serious) and one serious case of hypotension and dystonia, were 
responsible for study discontinuation. 
Study MB02-C-02-17: 
Through study week 52, there were slight but statistically non-significant differences between 
treatment groups in the total number of subjects who experienced TEAEs leading to discontinuation 
(23.2% in MB02 vs 20.3% in Avastin; p=0.39) or in the total discontinuations due to study-drug 
related TEAEs (13.5% in MB02 group vs 10.6% in Avastin group; p=0.27).  
A slightly higher number of patients in the MB02 group than in the Avastin group discontinued due to 
study drug-related and IMP-related serious TEAE, mostly while receiving 3-4 cycles or after receiving 
more than 6 cycles. The median dose administered per patient over the entire study was similar 
between the arms. The median exposure time was approximately three times longer in the MB02 
group than in the Avastin group, while the median number of cycles administered was slightly higher 
for this category of patients in the MB02 group. This can be explained either by more dose delays in 
the MB02 group or by a better tolerability to MB02 in the early cycles allowing the patients to continue 
the treatment for a longer time while a longer time of exposure increases the risk for higher incidents 
of serious adverse events or deaths.  When analysing the fatal TEAEs study drug-related and IMP-
related, 3 fatal cases were reported in the MB02 vs 0 in the Avastin group. Regarding the number of 
MB02 cycles administered in the 3 fatal cases, in 1 case up to 4 cycles and in the other 2 fatal cases 
more than 6 cycles were administered (median number of cycles 8). Based on the data presented, no 
clear conclusion on the relationship between exposure in time or dose intensity and the pattern of 
discontinuation due to toxicity or death can be drawn.

Table 48: Exposure to Study Treatments – Subjects that Discontinued Due to Fatal TEAEs, 
Fatal Study Drug-Related TEAEs, and Fatal IMP-Related TEAEs up to Week 52, SAF Set
The most commonly reported TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation were general physical health 
deterioration (31 subjects [5.0%]; 13 [4.2%] subjects in the MB02 group and 18 [5.8%] in the 
Avastin® group) and anemia (12 subjects [1.9%]; 7 [2.3%] subjects in the MB02 group and 5 [1.6%] 
in the Avastin® group) and the associated event of hemoglobin decreased (2 subjects [0.3%], both in 
the Avastin® group). No clear treatment group–related trends were observed for TEAEs leading to 
treatment discontinuation. In all cases, the risk difference between treatment groups in subjects 
reporting TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation was <2%. 
The Applicant also presented the proportion of subjects with drug-related TEAEs, any combination 
drug-related TEAEs, IMP-related TEAEs and chemotherapy-related AEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation. In general, less than 5% of subjects discontinued due to TEAEs in any specific SOCs. A 
difference between treatments was observed in IMP-related TEAEs in the SOC “Nervous system 
disorders” where five patients discontinued treatment in the MB02 arm as opposed to zero in the 
Avastin arm. Regarding IMP-related TEAEs, it is noticed that, though in general comparable between 
Assessment report

treatment arms, in the two SOCs “Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders” and “Nervous 
system disorders” more events were observed in the MB02 arm. Most were limited to mild events and 
were confounded by the concomitant chemotherapy medication. They do therefore not represent an 
impediment in the comparative safety assessment of MB02 and Avastin.  
Upon request from EMA, drug exposure in subjects who discontinued due to TEAEs were analysed, 
observing an slight higher proportion of discontinuations due to serious TEAEs in MB02 group than in 
Avastin group (8.7 % vs 5.2 %). The serious TEAE leading to discontinuation was drug-related or IMP-
related in a slightly higher number of patients in the MB02 group than in Avastin group, mostly while 
receiving 3-4 cycles or after receiving more than 6 cycles. In all cases differences were less than 5%. 
Drug exposure was assessed in these subjects, observing that the median dose administered per 
patient over the entire study was similar between the arms. The median exposure time to the study 
drug for subjects who discontinued due to serious TEAEs was longer and the median number of cycles 
administered was slightly higher in the MB02 group than in the Avastin group. As to regard to the fatal 
TEAEs study drug-related and IMP-related, 3 fatal cases were reported in the MB02 vs 0 in the Avastin 
group. These subjects received a median number of 8 cycles of MB02 in combination with 
chemotherapy.  
Based on the data presented, no clear conclusion on the relationship between exposure in time or dose 
intensity and the pattern of discontinuation due to toxicity or death can be drawn.

N/A 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety population consisted of all subjects who received at least one dose of bevacizumab in any of 
the following studies:  
• 
The pivotal phase 3 comparative efficacy, safety and immunogenicity study in non-squamous 
NSCLC patients (MB02-C-02-17),  
• 
the pivotal three-arm single dose PK study conducted in healthy volunteers in the UK (MB02-A-
02-17), 
• 
an additional three-arm single dose PK study conducted in healthy volunteers in Germany 
(MB02-A-05-18), 
• 
an additional two-arm single dose PK study conducted in healthy volunteers in Japan (MB02-A-
04-18), 
• 
and a phase I, open label, repeat-dose, parallel arm PK study in mCRC patients (BEVZ92-A-01-
13).  
Exposure: In total, 1037 subjects received at least one dose of IMP: 621 non-squamous NSCLC 
patients, 140 mCRC patients and 276 healthy volunteers. In the pivotal efficacy and safety study 
MB02-C-02-17 the mean duration of exposure was lower in the MB02 group (185.9 days compared 
with the Avastin group (203.9 days). While not statistically significant, the lower duration of exposure 
in MB02-treated subjects was likely attributed to the slightly higher rate of discontinuations up at week 
18 in the MB02 group than in Avastin group, particularly in the first cycles. Incidence of dose 
modifications or infusion interruption was low and balanced between treatment arms. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197736/2021  
Page 110/125 
 
 
 
 
Adverse events: The incidence and severity of TEAEs in PK study MB02-A-02-17 was comparable 
between MB02 and EU Avastin. The most frequently reported TEAEs were mild in severity and included 
headache (19.3%), upper respiratory tract infection, (18.4%), and back pain (10.5%), with slighty 
higher incidence with EU Avastin compared to MB02 in each of these terms. The incidence of ADRs was 
low and comparable between treatment arms (6 subjects vs. 8 subjects with MB02 and EU Avastin, 
respectively).   
A similar picture was observed in the PK study MB02-A-05-18 where the majority of TEAEs were mild 
or moderate in severity and treatment-related TEAEs were evenly distributed between the study arms. 
TEAEs considered to be treatment-related (possibly, probably or definitely-related) were reported in 33 
(28.9%) study subjects from all arms of the study.  
In PK study MB02-A-04-18, the incidence of TEAEs in the MB02 treatment group was slightly lower 
compared to the EU-Avastin treatment group (8 [33.3%] and 12 subjects [50.0%] in the MB02 and 
EU-Avastin treatment groups, respectively). The number of TEAEs was comparable between the MB02 
and EU-Avastin treatment groups. Only 3 of the 47 reported TEAEs were considered to be treatment-
related. All of them were observed in the EU-Avastin treatment group, with no treatment-related 
TEAEs observed in the MB02 treatment group. All of the 47 TEAEs reported in this study were classified 
as mild or moderate in severity. Of note, the number of TEAE was distinctly lower in study MB02-A-04-
18 compared to the other PK studies in healthy volunteers probably caused by slight differences in 
baseline characteristics (age, BMI) and a known trend towards  occasionally  lower  reporting  of  TEAEs 
in  Asian  countries.  
Study BEVZ92-A-01-13: All 71 patients in the EU-Avastin arm and 66 patients (96%) in the BEVZ92 
arm experienced at least one TEAE. A similar number of TEAEs considered related to administration of 
IMP were reported in each treatment arm; 24 (35%) and 26 (37%) of patients experienced at least 
one TEAE considered related only to IMP administration in the BEVZ92 and EU-Avastin arms, 
respectively. The SOCs with the largest number of patients reporting TEAEs (≥ 50 patients for each 
SOC) were gastrointestinal disorders, general disorders and administration site conditions, nervous 
system disorders, blood and lymphatic system disorders, metabolism and nutrition disorders, infections 
and infestations and investigations. Comparative analysis of the number of patients with particular AEs 
in the BEVZ92 and EU-Avastin arms of the study suggests a similar profile of AEs in the two treatment 
groups. The safety profiles were within expectations given the underlying disease and concomitant 
chemotherapy and consistent with the labelling information for Avastin. 
In Study MB02-C-02-17 the subject incidence was balanced between treatment arms, 92.6% subjects 
in the MB02 group and 92.9% subjects in the Avastin group (p = 0.89). The most common TEAEs were 
those commonly reported with the use of carboplatin/paclitaxel (e.g., alopecia, nausea, and 
neuropathy), as well as PTs related to myelosuppression (e.g., anaemia, thrombocytopenia, 
leukopenia, and neutropenia). Other TEAEs were those commonly reported with the use of 
bevacizumab (e.g., hypertension and proteinuria), and were similarly distributed between treatment 
groups. The most common TEAEs by preferred term (PT) were alopecia (51.2%) and anaemia 
(31.24%), with no considerable differences between treatment groups. More patients experienced 
grade 3 or 4 TEAEs with MB02 compared to Avastin (39.9% vs 38.1%, respectively). Grade 5 TEAEs 
were generally low in incidence and comparable between treatment groups. No clear treatment group-
related trends were observed for IMP-related TEAEs. In all cases, the risk difference between 
treatment groups in subjects reporting IMP-related TEAEs was <2%. 
Overall, the number, type, and severity of TEAEs of special interest was in alignment with the safety 
profile reported in the bevacizumab SmPC for this patient population. There were no new safety signals 
or observable trends reported for MB02-treated subjects. For all TEAEs of special interest, the 
difference in frequency between treatment groups of TEAEs reported was <5%. The most commonly

reported TEAEs of special interest were identified by the searches for events associated with 
neutropenia and infections (191 subjects [30.8%]). A total of 61 (9.8%) subjects experienced TEAEs 
associated with haemorrhage, pulmonary haemorrhage, and/or haemoptysis, with no observable risk 
difference between treatment groups with regard to subjects reporting TEAEs. Hypertension-related 
TEAEs were identified in 60 (9.7%) subjects; proteinuria-related TEAEs were identified in 46 (7.4%) 
subjects, with no observable risk difference between treatment groups with regard to subjects 
reporting TEAEs.  
Serious events and deaths:  
In PK study MB02-A-02-17, only one subject treated with US-Avastin experienced a serious TEAE. The 
event of purpura was considered as SUSAR and resolved without sequelae. No death occurred in this 
study.  
In study MB02-A-05-18 and in study MB02-A-04-18 no SAE or deaths occurred. 
Study BEVZ92-A-01-13: A total of 37 deaths were reported in the AT (safety) population. The majority 
of the deaths (24) were due to disease progression and were well balanced between both treatment 
arms and are expected events in the study population. 13 patients (8 [10%] and 5 [6%] in the 
BEVZ92 and Avastin arms, respectively) experienced at least one serious TEAE with fatal outcome. 
Fatal events were considered related to any of the study treatments (bevacizumab, chemotherapy or 
both) in four patients (two in each treatment arm). Only in one patient in the Avastin arm the fatal 
events were considered to be related exclusively to bevacizumab.  
The distribution of SAEs across the treatment arms by SOC were similar, as were the total number of 
patients reporting SAEs (19 [28%] in the BEVZ92 treatment arm and 21 [30%] in the Avastin arm). 
SAEs by PT that were reported in > 5% patients included intestinal obstruction (9%) in the BEVZ92 
group; and diarrhoea (7%), neutropenia (8%) and anaemia (6%) in the Avastin group. Most common 
treatment-related SAEs included neutropenia and diarrhoea, anaemia, leukopenia and sepsis, and 
hypotension. These events were more common in the Avastin arm, which may be a result of the 
relatively small sample size.  
In study MB02-C-02-17, serious TEAEs were observed in 58 (18.6%) and 54 (17.4%) of patients 
treated with MB02 or Avastin, respectively. No statistically significant difference (p=0.69) in serious 
TEAEs was observed between the MB02 and EU-Avastin treatment groups. No SAEs were reported 
during study drug infusion. A total of 66 (10.6%) subjects experienced study drug-related serious 
TEAEs during the study (33 subjects in each treatment group); the difference was not statistically 
significant (p=0.99). Of these cases, 39 (6.3%) subjects experienced serious TEAEs related to MB02 
(21 subjects [6.8%]) or EU-Avastin (18 subjects [5.8%]). A total of 51 (8.2%) subjects experienced 
serious TEAEs related to carboplatin and/or paclitaxel (24 subjects [7.7%] in the MB02 group 
compared to 27 subjects [8.7%] in the EU-Avastin group). The most common serious TEAEs were 
pneumonia (16 subjects [2.6%]), febrile neutropenia (11 subjects [1.8%]), pulmonary embolism (10 
subjects [1.6%]), and neutropenia and general physical health deterioration (9 subjects [1.4%] each). 
All other serious TEAEs were experienced by < 1% of subjects overall. The incidence of serious TEAEs 
observed between treatment groups was comparable, and no notable trends were observed in the 
reported PTs.  
Fatal TEAEs in study MB02-C-02-17 were observed in 23 (7.4%) and 24 (7.7%) of subjects with MB02 
and Avastin, respectively. Fatal TEAEs considered related to any study drug occurred in 12 subjects 
with no statistical significance between the groups (p=0.56); 7 subjects and 5 subjects in the MB02 
and EU-Avastin treatment groups, respectively. A total of 6 subjects had fatal TEAEs considered related 
to MB02 and three subjects had fatal TEAEs related to EU-Avastin. Reported fatal TEAEs are known 
ADR for bevacizumab.

In total, 16 SUSARs were reported during the study, of which 5 were fatal. Upon EMA request, a 
detailed explanation of all SUSAR cases including patient narratives and information on the patients’ 
medical history and concomitant medication was provided. Thus it was demonstrated that all cases 
could be explained by one or more of the following: side effects of concomitant medication; 
confounding by medical history or underlying disease; additional data on Avastin from published 
literature or the EudraVigilance database where similar events were observed. Based on the provided 
evaluation it is concluded that no new safety signals or observable trends have been identified in either 
treatment arm in the pivotal efficacy and safety study MB02-C-02-17 compared with the known safety 
profile of Avastin. A minor imbalance in discontinuation due to toxicity or death was observed in the 
group of patients who discontinued due to SAEs. A slightly higher number of patients in the MB02 
group than in Avastin group discontinued due to study drug-related and IMP-related serious TEAE, 
mostly while receiving 3-4 cycles or after receiving more than 6 cycles. The median dose administered 
per patient over the entire study was similar between the arms. Based on the data presented, no clear 
conclusion on the relationship between exposure in time or dose intensity and the pattern of 
discontinuation due to toxicity or death can be drawn. 
The Applicant also presented the proportion of subjects with drug-related TEAEs, any combination 
drug-related TEAEs, IMP-related TEAEs and chemotherapy-related AEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation. In general, less than 5% of subjects discontinued due to TEAEs in any specific SOCs. A 
small difference between treatments was observed in IMP-related TEAEs in two SOCs “Respiratory, 
thoracic and mediastinal disorders” and “Nervous system disorders” where more events were observed 
in the MB02 arm. During the evaluation procedure it was concluded that differences in IMP-related 
TEAEs between treatment arms in the two SOCs “Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders” and 
“Nervous system disorders” in study MB02-C-02-17 were limited to mild events and were confounded 
by the concomitant chemotherapy medication. They do therefore not represent an impediment in the 
comparative safety assessment of MB02 and Avastin.  
Immunogenicity: Total treatment-induced ADAs were mainly transient and were similar between 
products (MB02 and EU Avastin) across all studies for which immunogenicity data were submitted. In 
all studies, ADAs were present at baseline in some subjects. In the pivotal phase 3 study, a total of 38 
subjects (6.2%) tested positive for ADAs at baseline, although previous treatment with Avastin or 
other VEGF inhibitors was an exclusion criterion. Initially, an increased frequency of ADA positive 
baseline samples in the screening tier of the trial (17.4%) had been measured. This led to further 
investigations and new analyses with cut-points which better reflected the disease matrix (NSCLC 
serum) but may still have included a certain level of false positives, thus leading to the relatively high 
number of ADA positive patients at baseline. However, it was shown that the observed ADA baseline 
levels are in line with historical data for bevacizumab across different patient populations.  
The range of TI-ADAs was different between studies with the highest number in the supportive phase 1 
study conducted in Germany (MB02-A-05-18), where TI-ADAs were detected in 12 (31.5%) and 14 
(36.8%) subjects in the MB02 and EU-Avastin arm, respectively. Although the reasons for this 
observation could not be elucidated, it is acknowledged that similar incidences of TI-ADAs were 
observed between treatments arms within each individual study. Moreover, almost all ADAs were 
transient and appeared not to have effects on PK or safety.  
No impact on the safety in general and no immune-related safety risks in particular, seem to be 
correlated with treatment related antibodies.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Summary of analytical similarity 
The design of the analytical similarity exercise has been discussed in two CHMP advices (procedures 
EMEA/H/SA/3471/1/2017/III and EMEA/H/SA/3471/1/FU/2/2019/I). The Applicant generally followed 
the recommendations and relevant guidelines and performed a sound and comprehensive biosimilarity 
exercise using sensitive orthogonal state-of-the-art analytical methods that addressed the relevant 
quality attributes. Primary and higher order structure, post-translational modifications, size and charge 
variants, larger aggregates, general attributes, as well as Fab- or Fc-mediated biological functions were 
compared between MB02 and the reference product EU-Avastin. The Fab-mediated mechanism of 
action was evaluated by a range of biological assays at different levels (binding to various VEGF 
isoforms, competitive binding ELISA, HUVEC anti-proliferation assay, VEGF blocker reporter gene 
assay, receptor dimerization assay). Biological characteristics were further compared with regard to Fc 
receptor and mannose receptor binding, C1q binding, and CDC and ADCC activity. Size and charge 
variants were thoroughly characterised for both MB02 and EU-Avastin. A sufficient number of lots, 
which can be expected to sufficiently reflect product variability of both the proposed biosimilar and the 
reference product, was included. 
Summary of non-clinical data 
Non-clinical studies supported biosimilarity between MB02 and Avastin. The cynomolgus monkey 
repeated dose toxicity study BEVZ92-NC-01, conducted for MAA in non-EU regions, showed no relevant 
differences between BEVZ92 and EU-Avastin in mortality, clinical signs, body weights, ophthalmology, 
electrocardiography, haematology, clinical chemistry, urine analysis, organ weights, macroscopic and 
microscopic findings. Consequently, the study appears to support biosimilarity of BEVZ92 and EU-
Avastin; however, the small group size and occasionally high inter-individual variability in this study 
make it unreliable in terms of demonstrating biosimilarity. Therefore, results of this study should only 
be regarded as supplementary data. 
Summary of clinical data 
The design of the clinical studies has been discussed in two CHMP advices. From a clinical point of view 
the Applicant mostly followed EMA guidelines and the CHMP SA, except for additional PK sampling in 
the efficacy and safety study in patients, which was omitted.

The clinical developmental program compromised of 
- 
MB02-A-02-17: The pivotal PK-study was a randomised (1:1:1), double-blind, single dose (3 
mg/kg per IV infusion) parallel group study for a duration of up to 100 days comparing the 
pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity between MB02, EU- and US-Avastin in 114 healthy male 
volunteers. 
- 
MB02-C-02-17: A multi-centre, double-blind, parallel group, randomised (1:1), one-year 
clinical study comparing the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of MB02 to EU-Avastin (15 mg/kg 
every 3 weeks Q3W) in 627 patients with Stage IIIB/IV non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NS-
NSCLC).  
Supportive information for PK, immunogenicity and safety was provided from two phase I, single-dose 
studies: MB02-A-05-18 was conducted in Germany with 114 healthy volunteers, comparing MB02 to 
EU Avastin and US Avastin with a study design similar to the completed study MB02-A-02-17 to 
support FDA filing and MB02-A-04-18 had also a similar design and was conducted in 48 healthy 
Japanese volunteers comparing MB02 to EU Avastin to support PMDA filing.  
The applicant also provided supportive safety information from a phase I study BEVZ92-A-01-13 (open 
label repeat-dose parallel arm PK study) in 142 mCRC patients. 5 mg/kg BEVZ92 or EU-Avastin was 
administered in combination with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI by IV infusion once every two weeks.  
3.2.  Results supporting biosimilarity 
Quality 
In summary, the presented analytical data show similarity of the proposed biosimilar MB02 and the 
reference product EU-Avastin. Quality attributes related to the mechanism of action of bevacizumab 
were highly similar. The minor analytical differences observed for several quality attributes have been 
appropriately addressed by the Applicant and justified with regard to their potential impact on clinical 
performance of the product.  
Clinical 
• 
Pharmacokinetics 
Similarity between MB02 and EU-Avastin was demonstrated in study MB02-A-02-17, as the 90% CI for 
the geometric LS means ratios of protein-unadjusted AUCs and Cmax parameters were fully contained 
within the predefined bioequivalence limits of 0.80 to 1.25. Results for the difference in AUC0-∞ were 
1.16 with a 90% CI of [1.09, 1.22] and for Cmax 1.12 [1.03, 1.22], respectively. Results showed a 
statistically significant difference, as “1” was not included in the ratio, suggesting slight overexposure. 
Review of the protein concentrations administered to subjects demonstrated that subjects in the MB02 
arm received a dose of bevacizumab approximately 12 to 14% higher compared to the US and EU Avastin 
arms, due to the higher protein concentrations in the MB02 vials. The additionally performed sensitivity 
analysis correcting for actual protein content confirmed PK similarity, showing no statistically significant 
difference, with the point estimates near “1”. Although, which is seen with some caution, this analysis is 
supportive of PK similarity. A bioequivalence assessment on protein-unadjusted PK parameters was also 
performed  including  the  actual  protein  in  the  model  as  a  nested  parameter  of  treatment.  The  point 
estimates for AUC0-inf, AUC0-t and Cmax were 0.892, 0.885 and 0.897 respectively, with an upper limit 
of the 90% CI excluding “1” for all three parameters, suggesting slight underexposure, which is explained 
by the unbalanced strata in the nested model (29 vs 9 subjects) and the magnitude of the differences 
which  could  lead  to  an  inability  to  estimate  the  model  parameters  due  to  a  lack  of  variability  in  the 
protein content.

The secondary endpoints were in support of PK similarity. The terminal elimination half-life was 451h 
with MB02 and 449h with EU Avastin, the elimination rate constant was also similar. Tmax was slightly 
longer with EU-Avastin compared to MB02: 3h vs. 2.51h, respectively.  
Similarity was also demonstrated between MB02 and EU Avastin in the supportive studies MB02-A-04-
18 and MB02-A-05-18. In study MB02-A-05-18, the ratio of geometric least squares mean for AUC0-inf 
was 1.07 (90% CI: 1.00, 1.14) and for Cmax was 1.06 (90% CI: 0.976, 1.16). The 90% CIs were fully 
contained within the predefined equivalence limits of 0.80 to 1.25. The resulting 90% CI for AUC0-inf, 
where the lower limit covers exactly “1”, even indicates a slight overexposure of MB02. The secondary 
endpoints  were  in  support  of  PK  similarity.  Results  from  the  MB02-A-04-18  study  demonstrated 
equivalence in healthy Japanese male subjects, as the 90% CI for the geometric LS mean ratio for AUC0-
inf (1.04; 90% CI: 0.981, 1.11) was fully contained within the predefined equivalence limits of 0.80 to 
1.25. The secondary endpoints were also in support of PK similarity. 
•  Efficacy 
Primary endpoint: In the ITT population, the ORR by IRC was 40.3% (127/315) in the MB02 group and 
44.6% (139/312) in the EU-Avastin group resulting in the point estimate of -4.02 (95% CI: -11.76 to 
3.71) for the risk difference. The 95% CI for the risk difference was contained within the pre-
determined equivalence margin of ±12%. Under multiple imputation, the ORR RD showed similarity at 
95% CIs (-1.92; 95% CI: -10.02 to 6.19) and using the multiple imputation for subjects without 
tumour response data (missing, NonCR/NonPD or NE), the ORR RD was -2.22 with 95% CI of (-10.54 
to 6.10) at Week 18 in the ITT. In the mITT, the ORR difference was -2.77 (95% CI: -11.09 to 5.55) 
and showed also similar results. While the pre-defined equivalence range was not fully met for the 
initial PPS, when only the complete cases with overall response at week 18 were analysed, the RD of 
the ORR remained entirely within the equivalence margin (-2.66; 95% CI: -11.91 to  6.59). 
Additionally, by excluding only those patients from the PPS who had major protocol deviations with 
potential impact on efficacy, the ORR RD was -3.45 (95% CI -12.04 to 5.13) under the preferred 
analysis using multiple imputation adjusting for missing/NE.  
Similar efficacy between MB02 and Avastin was observed in analyses of best ORR in the ITT set based 
on the IRC assessments with a RD -4.04 (95% CI: -11.86 to 3.78).  
No relevant differences between treatment arms MB02 and Avastin were identified in patient subgroups. 
Secondary endpoints: 
The percentage change in tumour burden from baseline (sum of the diameters of the target lesions) 
was investigated post-hoc, showing no significant difference between the treatments. The mean of the 
%change from baseline in tumour burden by week 18 was −26.64 for MB02 and −25.75 for Avastin; 
the difference between the treatment groups was −0.892 (95% CI of −4.828, 3.044). Results were 
comparable by Week 6 and Week 12, with a difference of −0.976 and −1.133, respectively. Analysis of 
the %change in tumour burden assessed by the investigator was comparable with the IRRC 
assessment.  
For PFS in the ITT set, the HR was 1.200 with 95% CI (0.985, 1.462). For PFS in the PPS, the HR was 
1.233  with  95%  CI  (0.999  to  1.521).  For  OS  in  the  ITT  set,  the  HR  was  1.107  with  95%  CI  (0.826, 
1.483) and in the PPS, the HR was 1.141 with 95% CI (0.835, 1.560). 
•  Safety 
In  PK  study  MB02-A-02-17,  incidence  and  severity  of  TEAEs  was  comparable  between  MB02  and  EU 
Avastin. TEAEs occurred in 63.2% and 65.5% of subjects, respectively. The incidence of ADRs was low 
and  also  comparable  between  treatment  arms  (6  subjects  vs.  8  subjects  with  MB02  and  EU  Avastin, 
respectively).  The  only  serious  event  (purpura)  was  rated  as  SUSAR  and  occurred  in  the  US-Avastin

treatment arm. It developed after an  upper respiratory tract infection and resolved without sequelae. 
Only  few  patients  had  out-of-range  laboratory  values.  They  were  transient  and  comparable  between 
treatment arms, resolving without intervention by the next scheduled clinical laboratory evaluation.  
A similar picture was observed in the PK study MB02-A-05-18 where the majority of TEAEs were mild 
or moderate in severity and treatment-related TEAEs were evenly distributed between the study arms. 
TEAEs considered to be treatment-related were reported in 33 (28.9%) study subjects from all arms of 
the study.  
In PK study MB02-A-04-18, the number of TEAEs was comparable between the MB02 and Avastin 
treatment groups. Only 3 of the 47 reported TEAEs were considered to be treatment-related. All of 
them were observed in the Avastin treatment group, with no treatment-related TEAEs observed in the 
MB02 treatment group. All of the 47 TEAEs reported in this study were classified as mild or moderate 
in severity. 
In Study BEVZ92-A-01-13, 24 (35%) and 26 (37%) of patients experienced at least one TEAE 
considered related only to IMP administration in the BEVZ92 and Avastin arms, respectively. 
Comparative analysis of the number of patients with particular AEs in the BEVZ92 and Avastin arms of 
the study suggests a similar profile of AEs in the two treatment groups. The safety profiles were within 
expectations given the underlying disease and concomitant chemotherapy and consistent with the 
labelling information for Avastin. A total of 37 deaths were reported in the all treated (= safety) 
population. The majority of the deaths (24) were due to disease progression and were well balanced 
between both treatment arms and are expected events in the study population. 13 patients (8 [10%] 
and 5 [6%] in the BEVZ92 and Avastin arms, respectively) experienced at least one serious TEAE with 
fatal outcome. Fatal events were considered related to any of the study treatments (bevacizumab, 
chemotherapy or both) in four patients (two in each treatment arm). Only in one patient in the Avastin 
arm the fatal events were considered to be related exclusively to bevacizumab. The distribution of 
SAEs across the treatment arms by SOC were similar, as were the total number of patients reporting 
SAEs (19 [28%] in the BEVZ92 treatment arm and 21 [30%] in the Avastin arm). 
In  Study  MB02-C-02-17,  the  subject incidence  of  TEAEs  was  balanced  between  treatment  arms,  with 
92.6% subjects in the MB02 group and 92.9% subjects in the Avastin group. The most common TEAEs 
were  those  commonly  reported  with  the  use  of  carboplatin/paclitaxel  (e.g.,  alopecia,  nausea,  and 
neuropathy), as well as PTs related to myelosuppression (e.g., anaemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia 
and  neutropenia).  Other  TEAEs  were  those  commonly  reported  with  the  use  of  bevacizumab  (e.g., 
hypertension and proteinuria), and were similarly distributed between treatment groups. The majority 
of subjects experienced TEAEs classified as NCI CTCAE severity Grade 1 or 2 events. No clear treatment 
group-related trends were observed for IMP-related TEAEs. 
Serious TEAEs were observed in 58 (18.6%) and 54 (17.4%) of patients treated with MB02 or Avastin, 
respectively. No statistically significant difference (p=0.69) in serious TEAEs was observed between the 
MB02 and Avastin treatment groups. No SAEs were reported during study drug infusion. A total of 66 
(10.6%) subjects experienced study drug-related serious TEAEs during the study (33 subjects in each 
treatment group); the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.99). Of these cases, 39 (6.3%) 
subjects  experienced  serious  TEAEs  related  to  MB02  (21  subjects  [6.8%])  or  Avastin  (18  subjects 
[5.8%]). A total of 51 (8.2%) subjects experienced serious TEAEs related to carboplatin and/or paclitaxel 
(24 subjects [7.7%] in the MB02 group compared to 27 subjects [8.7%] in the Avastin group). 
Fatal  TEAEs  were  observed in  7.4%  and 7.7% of  subjects with  MB02 and Avastin, respectively. Fatal 
TEAEs  considered  related  to  any  study  drug  occurred  in  12  subjects  with  no  statistical  significance 
between the groups (p=0.56) – 7 subjects and 5 subjects in the MB02 and Avastin treatment groups, 
respectively. A total of 6 subjects had fatal TEAEs considered related to MB02 and three subjects had 
fatal TEAEs related to Avastin. The majority of the reported fatal TEAEs are known ADR for bevacizumab.

Immunogenicity:  Total  treatment-induced  ADAs  were  mainly  transient  and  were  similar  between 
products (MB02 and EU Avastin) across all studies for which immunogenicity data were submitted. In all 
studies,  ADAs  were  present  at  baseline  in  some  subjects.  No  impact  on  the  safety  in  general  and  no 
immune-related safety risks in particular, seem to be correlated with treatment related antibodies. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about biosimilarity 
Quality 
The presented analytical data show similarity of the proposed biosimilar MB02 and the reference product 
EU-Avastin. Quality attributes related to the mechanism of action of bevacizumab were highly similar. 
The  minor  analytical  differences  observed  for  several  quality  attributes  have  been  appropriately 
addressed by the Applicant and justified with regard to their potential impact on clinical performance of 
the product. 
The samples used in the analytical similarity exercise have been stored frozen prior to analysis. However, 
based  on  the  available  data,  it  is  deemed  unlikely  that  freezing  will  specifically  impact  the  reference 
product.  
A  partial  metabolic  amino  acid  substitution  is  observed  for  MB02,  which  affects  the  formation  of 
disulphide bridges. These variants are not present in Avastin. However, the extent of replacement is low. 
As demonstrated by analytical data the exchange has no effect on biological activity and structure under 
native  conditions.  An  impact  on  immunogenicity  appears  unlikely;  indeed,  the  clinical  data  show 
comparable immunogenicity of MB02 and Avastin.  
Clinical 
Efficacy 
Primary endpoint: For the PP set, the pre-defined equivalence margin for the difference in ORR at week 
18 was not met, with a 95% CI of (-12.92 to 4.38) under non-responder imputation and a 95% CI of (-
13.68 to 3.68) under multiple imputation.  
Secondary  endpoints:  The  Kaplan-Meier  plots  for  PFS  and  OS  in  both  ITT  set  and  PPS  set  show  a 
consistent trend for better outcomes for subjects in the Avastin group than subjects in the MB02 group, 
although in a statistically non-significant manner.  
Safety 
Study MB02-C-02-17: 
A slight imbalance in discontinuation due to toxicity or death was observed between the treatment arms 
(median duration of exposure: 182 days in MB02 group vs 204 days in Avastin group). A slightly higher 
number of patients in the MB02 group than in Avastin group discontinued due to study drug-related and 
IMP-related serious TEAE, mostly while receiving 3-4 cycles or after receiving more than 6 cycles. Based 
on the data presented, no clear conclusion on the relationship between exposure in time or dose intensity 
and the pattern of discontinuation due to toxicity or death can be drawn. 
Although  IMP-related  TEAEs  were  in  general  comparable  between  treatment  arms,  in  the  two  SOCs 
“Respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders”  and  “Nervous  system  disorders”  more  events  were 
observed in the MB02 arm. However, these findings were limited to mild events and were confounded 
by the concomitant chemotherapy medication.  
The occurrence of SUSARs in the setting of a similar biological medicinal product application, where a 
known active substance with a well-described safety profile is investigated, required further evaluation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197736/2021  
Page 120/125 
 
 
 
 
The Applicant acknowledged that three events should not have been reported as SUSARs as they are 
clearly listed in the RSI as expected events. Also, the remaining cases were explained retrospectively 
by one or more of the following: side effects of concomitant medication; confounding by medical 
history or underlying disease; additional data on Avastin from published literature or the 
EudraVigilance database where similar events were observed. 
Immunogenicity: 
In all studies, ADAs were present at baseline in some subjects. In the pivotal phase 3 study, a total of 
38 subjects (6.1%) tested positive for ADAs at baseline, although previous treatment with Avastin or 
other VEGF inhibitors was an exclusion criterion. Initially, an increased frequency of ADA positive 
baseline samples in the screening tier of the trial (17.4%) had been measured. This led to further 
investigations and new analyses with cut-points, which better reflected the disease matrix (NSCLC 
serum) but may still have included a certain level of false positives, thus leading to the relatively high 
number of ADA positive patients at baseline. However, it was shown that the observed ADA baseline 
levels are in line with historical data for bevacizumab across different patient populations.  
The range of TI-ADAs was different between studies with the highest number in the supportive phase 1 
study conducted in Germany (MB02-A-05-18), where TI-ADAs were detected in 12 (31.5%) and 14 
(36.8%) subjects in the MB02 and EU-Avastin arm, respectively. Although the reasons for this 
observation could not be elucidated, it is acknowledged that similar incidences of TI-ADAs were 
observed between treatments arms within each individual study.  
Furthermore,  a difference in efficacy in terms of ORR at Week 18 was observed in TI-ADA positive 
subjects between the treatments (ORR 52.8% and 68% for the MB02 arm and the Avastin arm, 
respectively) in study MB02-C-02-17. In response to outstanding issues the applicant provided further 
analyses on the difference in ORR between TI-ADA positive subjects and it was overall concluded that 
the findings were minimal and do not account for any differences in efficacy between the products. 
3.4.    Discussion on biosimilarity 
Overall, the design of the analytical similarity exercise is considered adequate. The results demonstrate 
high analytical similarity between MB02 and EU-Avastin. Analytical differences observed between MB02 
and the reference product have been adequately justified with regard to their potential impact on 
clinical performance. Notably, molecule variants with partial amino acid substitution are present in 
MB02 that are not observed in Avastin; however, the extent of the substitution is low and hence, an 
impact on clinical performance is not expected. The quantitative differences in free thiol content, basic 
peak 2, and mannose content have been adequately addressed.  
Pharmacokinetic similarity of MB02 to EU-Avastin was demonstrated in the pivotal single dose PK study 
MB02-A-02-17 in HV, based on primary PK parameters. The post-hoc performed protein-corrected 
analysis supports the primary results. The two supportive studies MB02-A-04-18 and MB02-A-05-18 
also demonstrated similarity of the pharmacokinetics of MB02 and EU-Avastin, based on the primary 
PK parameters. Therefore, biosimilarity on PK level can be concluded from three independent PK 
studies.  
Generally, the Applicant has established in compliance with the relevant guidelines a comprehensive 
program for the purpose of investigating the similarity between MB02 and EU-Avastin. Based on the 
analytical data and the PK studies performed, no differences have been identified that give rise to 
uncertainty over the expected clinical performance. 
The pivotal efficacy and safety study in non-squamous NSCLC patients was adequately designed and 
the chosen primary and secondary efficacy outcomes and equivalence criteria are deemed acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197736/2021  
Page 121/125 
 
 
 
 
The results of the ORR risk difference at week 18 in the ITT population demonstrated biosimilarity 
between MB02 and EU Avastin within the equivalence margin of 12%. In the initial PP population under 
multiple imputation that does not favour the treatment arm with less missing values, the 95% CI of 
the ORR RD (-13.68, 3.68) did go below -13%, however.  
Additional analyses were presented by including only those patients from the ITT set that completed 
Week 18 and had overall response (OR of CR, PR, SD or PD per RECIST v1.1). In selecting this 
population, the patients that experience response of NE and non-CR/non-PD due to non-evaluable 
target lesions at baseline, have been excluded. This analysis set has a similar intention as the pre-
specified PPS, i.e. to assess differences in the treatments reducing the impact of unrelated factors on 
the outcome assessment, in this case based on the set of actual data that are generated over the 
course of treatment. The ORR RD was fully contained within the predefined acceptance range of [-
12%, +12%]. Though the interpretation of this result needs to be balanced against not fully respecting 
randomisation (as no PPS analysis does) and regarding multiplicity considering its post-hoc character, 
this analysis in a more sensitive model of completing patients supports similarity of MB02 and Avastin 
with respect to the primary endpoint ORR. 
Another relevant analysis approximating the per-protocol set was provided that excluded only those 
patients from the PPS who had major protocol deviations with potential impact on efficacy. This means 
that compared to the initial PPS definition those patients were included where the reason for the 
protocol violation was considered unrelated to later treatment efficacy. The intent of this request was 
to increase the sample size, and thereby to increase the precision of the information on the difference 
between the treatments, as based on a decreased sample size the PPS has by definition the property 
to have less statistical power. In the thereby defined analysis set and under the preferred analysis 
using multiple imputation adjusting for missing/NE, the ORR RD was -3.45 (95% CI -12.04 to 5.13) 
and thus like the complete cases set demonstrated comparable between the two treatments.  
The ORR over time (Week 6, 12 and 18) does not show a consistent pattern and makes the suspicion of 
a treatment effect seem implausible, but rather suggests a random element.  
Tumour burden on a continuous scale might be expected to increase sensitivity in terms of detecting 
potential treatment differences and is less prone to a biased assessment than ORR. All 95% CIs around 
the difference in means of %change in tumour burden show maintained response within +5/-5%, 
across both ITT and PPS. While it is noted that no margin was pre-specified for this endpoint, the 
extension of the confidence intervals for the difference in LSMeans is small in relation to the change 
from baseline, indicating good quantification of the differences and supporting similarity of the two 
treatments across the analysis. Though in the lack of pre-specified equivalence margins this result 
cannot be used as a sole confirmatory result, it can be considered sensitive to detect differences 
between the treatments arms and adds supporting evidence of similarity. Therefore, tumour burden 
strengthens the notion of similarity between MB02 and Avastin in the clinical assessment.  
Other secondary efficacy endpoints were in consistency with the primary endpoint, with point 
estimates favouring EU Avastin. The slightly higher efficacy estimated for Avastin vs MB02 on the 
primary and secondary endpoints could be partly explained by the slightly lower exposure and number 
of cycles of IMP and chemotherapy in the MB02 arm than in the Avastin arm. Similar differences in 
exposure were also seen in the SAF set, where this imbalance did not lead to a crossing of the 
acceptance range in the ITT analysis for the ORR RD. 
Nonetheless, the comparability exercise at the quality and functional level forms the basis of the 
biosimilarity demonstration, and similarity was demonstrated in the relevant characteristics. Similarity 
in PK was also concluded in a well conducted study in healthy volunteers. These are the most sensitive 
parts of the comparability exercise. In the efficacy and safety trial, the primary analysis in the ITT 
population met the predefined equivalence margins, and while the initial PPS analysis on the ORR 
Assessment report

Page 122/125 
 
 
 
 
extended wider, several requested post-hoc results including sensitive models support similarity with 
respect to the primary endpoint ORR. The safety seems broadly comparable.  
In summary, the initial ITT efficacy data and the requested additional results in sensitive analyses sets 
together with the evidence provided by analytical/ quality parameters, clinical PK, safety and 
immunogenicity support a conclusion of demonstration of biosimilarity based on the entire data 
package.  
3.5.  Extrapolation of safety and efficacy 
The indications approved for the reference product Avastin were applied for Oyavas except for one 
concerning platinum-resistant recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. 
The primary mechanism of action of bevacizumab is the inhibition of tumour vessel growth by blocking 
VEGF. The mode of action of bevacizumab is considered to be the same across all approved cancer 
indications of Avastin. The biological activities related to the mode of action have been 
comprehensively evaluated in the analytical similarity exercise. Extrapolation to all other approved 
indications of the reference product is considered acceptable. 
3.6.  Additional considerations  
Not applicable. 
3.7.  Conclusions on biosimilarity and benefit risk balance 
Based on the review of the submitted data, Oyavas 25 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion is 
considered approvable.  
4.  Recommendations

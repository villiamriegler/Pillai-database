Extension of indication to include treatment of adult men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate 
cancer (mHSPC) in combination with docetaxel, based on final results from Study 17777 (ARASENS); 
this is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study designed to demonstrate the 
superiority of darolutamide in combination with docetaxel over placebo in combination with docetaxel 
in OS in patients with mHSPC. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.8, and 5.1 of the SmPC are 
updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 2.1 of the RMP has also been 
submitted. As part of the application, the MAH is also requesting one additional year of market 
protection. 
The variation requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet 
and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
CW/0001/2015 on the granting of a class waiver.  
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
MAH request for additional market protection 
Initially the Market Authorization Holder (MAH) requested consideration of its application in accordance 
with Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) 726/2004 - one year of market protection for a new indication. 
The request was withdrawn during the procedure.  
Scientific advice 
The MAH received Scientific advice (SA) from the CHMP on 24 September 2015 
(EMEA/H/SA/2639/2/2015/II). The Scientific advice pertained to clinical aspects of the dossier. SA was 
provided on the use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (i.e. orchiectomy, luteinizing hormone-

releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists or antagonists) based on investigator’s choice, which was 
considered acceptable by the CHMP; the use of docetaxel as backbone treatment; the proposed 
stratification factors (i.e. extent of disease and the level of alkaline phosphatase) as well as the 
primary endpoint (overall survival) and the statistical design and secondary endpoints. Some other 
questions were raised to the CHMP.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Claimed the therapeutic indication 
The applied indication for Nubeqa was for the treatment of adult men with metastatic hormone-
sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) in combination with docetaxel.  
The recommended indication is: NUBEQA is indicated for the treatment of adult men with metastatic 
hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) in combination with docetaxel and androgen deprivation 
therapy (see section 5.1). 
Epidemiology  
Prostate  cancer  is  the  second  most  frequent  cancer  diagnosed  in  men,  and  the  fifth  leading  cause  of 
death in the world. Based on Global Cancer Observatory (GLOBOCAN) 2020 estimates, 1,414,259 new 
cases of prostate cancer were reported worldwide, with higher prevalence in developed countries (Sung 
et al. 2021). In Europe, the estimated number in 2020 of new prostate cancer cases was approximately 
473,344, and the number of deaths was approximately 108,088 (Sung et al. 2021). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Metastatic HSPC is defined as metastatic prostate cancer in patients who have not yet received or are 
continuing  to  respond  to  anti-hormonal  therapy.  Depriving  prostate  cancer  cells  of  androgen  is  the 
primary form of therapy since prostate cancer depends on androgen for growth and survival. Androgen 
deprivation therapy (ADT) is defined as surgical castration by bilateral orchiectomy or medical castration 
with LHRH agonist/antagonists. Metastatic HSPC can occur due to recurrence after initial local treatment 
with surgery  and/or radiotherapy, or as de novo  disease in  patients whose first  diagnosis of  prostate 
cancer is metastatic disease (Lowrance et al. 2021). 
Metastatic  castration  resistant  prostate  cancer  is  associated  with  a  range  of  symptoms  but  is 
predominantly characterised by bone pain, fatigue, and urinary dysfunction. Metastasis is predominantly 
Assessment report  
EMA/80060/2023  
Page 11/147 
 
 
 
 
localized  in  bones  (90%  of  patients  with  metastatic  castration-resistant  prostate  cancer),  causing 
significant morbidity which requires medical interventions. 
Although almost all men with mHSPC initially respond to ADT, most will progress to mCRPC within 1 to 
3 years of their initial diagnosis (Wenzel et al. 2021). 
Management 
The treatment and management of patients with mHSPC has evolved over recent years with several new 
treatment  options.  Historically,  for  decades  ADT,  achieved  by  surgical  or  medical  castration,  was  the 
standard of care (SOC) for mHSPC. Nowadays, ADT in combination with one of the following is currently 
approved  in  the  EU  for  the  treatment  of  mHSPC:  abiraterone,  a  CYP17  inhibitor  (with  prednisone  or 
prednisolone), apalutamide, an androgen receptor inhibitor (ARI), or enzalutamide, another ARI. In the 
EU, docetaxel in combination with ADT, with or without prednisone or prednisolone, is also approved for 
the treatment of mHSPC. (C Parker et al. Ann Oncol 2020)  
2.1.2.  About the product 
Darolutamide is a structurally distinct non-steroidal ARI that binds with a high affinity and selectivity to 
the AR, thus inhibiting androgen binding, AR nuclear translocation and AR mediated transcription, thus 
preventing transcription of oncologic genes necessary for cancer growth and survival. 
Chemical structure of darolutamide 
Darolutamide (Nubeqa) was first approved in the EU on 27 March 2020 for the treatment of adult men 
with non-metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) who are at high risk of developing 
metastatic disease.  
The recommended dose is 600 mg darolutamide (two tablets of 300 mg) taken twice daily, equivalent 
to a total daily dose of 1200 mg. The proposed dose for the current indication is the same. 
Darolutamide should be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. mHSPC patients 
should start darolutamide in combination with docetaxel.The first of 6 cycles of docetaxel should be 
administered within 6 weeks after the start of darolutamide treatment. Treatment with darolutamide 
should be continued until disease progression or unaccepatble toxicity even if a cycle of docetaxel is 
delayed, interrupted, or discontinued. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The  pivotal  study  to  support  efficacy  and  safety  of  darolutamide  for  the  treatment  in  the  mHSPC 
population is the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 Study 17777 (ARASENS). Study 
17777 was designed to demonstrate the superiority of darolutamide in combination with docetaxel over 
placebo in combination with docetaxel in overall survival (OS). The study randomized 1306 patients in 
Assessment report  
EMA/80060/2023  
Page 12/147 
 
 
 
 
 
a  1:1  ratio  to  receive  6  cycles  of  docetaxel  and  either  darolutamide  +  docetaxel  +  ADT  or  matching 
placebo+docetaxel concurrently with ADT until disease progression. 
The MAH sought Scientific Advice at the CHMP on the design of study 17777, the pivotal trial for this 
application  (EMEA/H/SA/2639/2/2015/II)  (See  section  1).  The  MAH  mostly 
followed 
the 
recommendations of the CHMP scientific advice. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. The MAH has 
provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out 
in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
New non-clinical studies as well as environmental studies have been submitted in support to this 
procedure. The non-clinical studies are oncology studies conducted in transgenic mice submitted and 
discussed under Variation EMEA/H/C/004790/II/0012. The submitted study on the environmental risk 
was an update of the study submitted in 2019. 
2.2.2.  Pharmacology                                                                                          
2.2.3.  Toxicology  
Carcinogenicity 
The carcinogenic potential of darolutamide was evaluated in a 6-month study in TgRAS transgenic mice. 
Seven -day and 4-week studies were also conducted to select the appropriate dosing regimen for the 6-
month study. 
The chosen maximum tolerated dose was 500 mg/kg twice daily.

assess the endocrine disrupting (ED) potential of darolutamide.  
On the basis of these study results, it appears that darolutamide poses a risk to aquatic organisms in 
surface  waters.  This  result  leads  the  manufacturer  to  calculate  a  Refined  PECsw  (based  on  a  refined 
Fpen) which no longer showed any risk for aquatic organisms in surface waters.

2.2.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The carcinogenic potential of darolutamide was evaluated in a 6-month study in TgRAS transgenic mice 
presented  in  Variation  EMEA/H/C/004790/II/0012.  The  study  was  well  constructed  about  number  of 
mice, positive and negative controls. The chosen maximum tolerated dose was 1000 mg/kg/day. This is 
a  dose  which  did  not  show  any  toxicity  in  transgenic  mice.  Beyond  this  dose,  the  appearance  of  an 
exposure plateau justified the choice of this maximum dose. The results of this study did not demonstrate 
an increase in tumor development in mice treated with darolutamide versus untreated mice. However, 
studies in transgenic mice alone and the maximum dose used do not offer sufficient safety margins to 
rule out the risk of second primary cancers in humans. 
Since darolutamide unlike other second-generation anti-androgens did not produce pre-neoplastic lesion 
in repeated toxicity studies and in order to reduce the use of animals, the need for 2-year studies in 
rats, was waived. 
2.2.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The 6-month study in transgenic mice did not show significantly higher tumor occurrence in treated 
mice compared to negative controls. However, this study alone does not rule out the risk of a second 
primary cancer in humans, especially since the safety margins are low. The non-discarded risk of 
development of a second primary cancer in humans has been added to the SmPC. 
Darolutamide was found to be very persistent and not readily biodegradable but without toxicity to 
aquatic organisms.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Darolutamide pharmacokinetic (PK) in mHSPC patients has been investigated in Study 17777 
ARASENS using non-compartmental analysis (NCA) and population PK modelling and simulation 
techniques (study number CPMX50017 / report R-13408, report date 10 January 2022). This pivotal 
study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating the efficacy and safety of 
600 mg (bis in die) BID oral darolutamide in combination with docetaxel (75 mg/m2 Day 1 as 1 h 
intravenous [IV] infusion every 21 days) in mHSPC patients for six treatment cycles. 
In addition, the PK has been investigated in a subgroup of Chinese patients who were randomized to 
the darolutamide+docetaxel arm.  Moreover, exposure-response analysis was provided.  
Clinical pharmacology data in mHSPC patients were compared, where applicable, with the previously 
submitted data in nmCRPC patients from a Phase 3 Study 17712 (ARAMIS). 
2.3.2.1.  Methods 
2.3.2.1.1.  Bioanalytical methods 
•  Darolutamide 
In study 17777, bioanalysis of darolutamide, the two diastereomers, (S,R)-darolutamide and (S,S)-
darolutamide, and its metabolite keto-darolutamide in human plasma (K2EDTA) was performed 
utilizing quantitative high performance LC-MS/MS assay. All Samples were stored at nominal 
temperature of -20°C and analysed within at most 728 days after sampling. The stability data 
indicated that the analyte(s) were stable for this time period. A summary of the calibration range, 
precision and accuracy is provided in Table 1. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) values for 
(S,R)-darolutamide, (S,S)-darolutamide, keto-darolutamide and docetaxel were 4.87 μg/L, 5.13 μg/L, 
10 μg/L and 1 μg/L respectively.

•  Docetaxel 
In study 17777, quantitative analysis of docetaxel in plasma was performed utilizing liquid phase 
extraction followed by quantitative high performance LC-MS/MS detection, with quantitation being 
achieved by weighted linear regression using paclitaxel as the internal standard. All samples were 
stored at -20°C and -80°C and analysed within 1158 days after sampling. The stability data indicated 
that docetaxel was stable for this time period. A summary of the calibration range, precision and 
accuracy is provided in Table 2.

2.3.2.1.2.  Pharmacokinetic analyses 
The PK of darolutamide (i.e. the sum of the two diastereomers (S,S), and (S,R)-darolutamide), (S,S)-
darolutamide, (S,R)-darolutamide, keto-darolutamide, and docetaxel were evaluated in study 17777 
ARASENS. 
PK data were analysed using NCA and population PK modelling. NCA evaluation was performed using 
WinNonlin Phoenix (Certara). Population PK modelling and simulation was performed using the 
nonlinear-mixed effects modelling approach with NONMEM software (ICON Development Solutions, 
version 7.4).  
In the first 25 patients (safety/PK lead-in) PK samples were taken on day 1 pre-dose, and after 20 
min, 1h, 1.5 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 6 h, and 8 h post-dose, as well as two additional samples at two later 
visits (one per visit). For those who received at least 1 cycle of docetaxel, AUC(0–12) (using the pre-
dose plasma sample also as 12 hour sample), AUC(0–8), AUC(0–tlast), Cmax, tmax, tlast were estimated for 
darolutamide, (S,S)-darolutamide, (S,R)-darolutamide, keto-darolutamide, and docetaxel. For 
docetaxel, AUC(0–t last), Cmax, tmax, and tlast were estimated.  
For all other patients, sparse PK sampling was done.  
China PK substudy: At sites in China additional blood samples at visit 1 (days 1, 2 and 3), and day 15 
for assessment of pharmacokinetics were drawn. Differences in study drug administration compared to 
the main study were (i) single dosing of study drug on day 1, (ii) study treatment holiday on day 2, 
and (iii) tart of regular twice-a-day dosing of study drug on day 3. 
Absorption 
The population PK analysis using data from Study 17777 ARASENS in patients with mHSPC showed 
that peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of darolutamide following oral administration of 600 mg 
(2 tablets of 300 mg), were about 20 % lower compared to those observed in study 17712 ARAMIS in 
patients with nmCRPC (i.e. 3.84 mg/L [35.6 %CV] versus 4.79 mg/L [30.9 %CV]).  
In study 17712 ARAMIS in patients with nmCRPC Cmax were usually reached around 4 hours after 
administration. 
Distribution 
The apparent volume of distribution of darolutamide after intravenous administration is 119 L. The 
population PK analysis using data from Study 17777 ARASENS in patients with mHSPC reveal an 
overall volume of distribution of 32.7 L (117 %CV) after oral administration of 600 mg BID of 
darolutamide. 
 Elimination 
The clearance of darolutamide following intravenous administration was 116 mL/min (CV: 39.7%).  
In study 17712 ARAMIS in patients with nmCRPC the effective half-life of darolutamide and 
keto-darolutamide in plasma of patients was approximately 20 hours. Of the two diastereomers 
comprising darolutamide, (S,R)-darolutamide had a shorter effective half-life of 9 hours compared to 
(S,S)-darolutamide with an effective half-life of 22 hours.  
The population PK analysis using data from Study 17777 ARASENS in patients with mHSPC revealed 
that the effective half-life of darolutamide, (S,R)-darolutamide, (S,S)-darolutamide, and

keto-darolutamide in plasma of patients were approximately 18.4 h (62 %CV), 10.9 h (76.2 %CV), 
20.5 h (58.8 %CV), and 19 h (63.2 %CV), respectively.

Variability was reported to be higher in study 17777 ARASENS in patients with mHSPC (Table 8) 
compared to study 17712 ARAMIS in patients with nmCRPC (Table 11). 
2.3.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics in target population 
The PK in the pivotal study 17777 ARASENS was analysed using NCA and population PK modelling 
methods.

Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive darolutamide or placebo at 600 mg (2 tablets 
of 300 mg) BID with food, equal to a daily dose of 1200 mg. Randomization was stratified by extent of 
disease  and  alkaline  phosphatase  (ALP)  levels.  Docetaxel  was  administered  after  randomization,  at  a 
dose of 75 mg/m2 as an IV infusion every 21 days for 6 cycles, and the first cycle was to be administered 
within  6  weeks  after  the  start  of  study  drug.  Docetaxel  could  be  administered  in  combination  with 
prednisone/prednisolone at the discretion of the investigator. All patients were required to receive ADT 
of  the  investigator’s  choice  (luteinizing  hormone-releasing  hormone  [LHRH]  agonist/antagonists  or 
orchiectomy) as standard therapy starting ≤12 weeks before randomization.

NCA results for study 17777 ARASENS 
Safety/PK lead-in phase 
In total, PK data from 25 patients were evaluated during the safety/PK lead-in phase. Among those, 
12 patients were randomized into the darolutamide + docetaxel arm. 
The results from NCA evaluation showed a slight increase in exposure in the darolutamide + docetaxel 
arm compared with the placebo + docetaxel arm (Table 4) with the AUC(0–tlast) being 6% higher (2.10 
vs. 1.98 mg*h/L) and Cmax being 15% higher (1.93 vs. 1.68 mg/L) in the darolutamide + docetaxel 
arm (23 – 54 %CV docetaxel).

Population PK modelling results for study 17777 ARASENS  
Study number: CPMX50017 / report R-13408, report date 10 January 2022 
Objectives 
A previously developed population PK model for nmCRCP patients was used to describe the PK of 
darolutamide in mHSPC patients. In addition, the PK of (S,S)-darolutamide, (S,R)- darolutamide and 
keto-darolutamide were investigated and covariates potentially influencing their PK were examined. 
Moreover, individual docetaxel clearance and exposure on the basis of established literature models 
were evaluated. The potential of drug-drug interaction between darolutamide and docetaxel was 
analysed (refer to section “Pharmacokinetic interaction studies”).  Furthermore, a meta-population PK 
analysis of study 17777 and study 17712 was done (presented below). 
Data 
Among the 1305 patients included in study 17777 ARASENS, 645 contributed to the darolutamide final 
population PK model analysis with 2496 concentrations of both (S,S)-darolutamide and keto-
darolutamide and 2485 concentrations of (S,R)-darolutamide above the LLOQ. In addition, a total of 
190 observations of both (S,S)- darolutamide and keto-darolutamide and 201 concentrations of (S,R)-
darolutamide were below the LLOQ. In total, 1252 patients contributed to the PK assessment of 
docetaxel, with 2135 samples above the LLOQ and 225 concentration measures below the LLOQ, and 
94 excluded.  
A visualisation revealed non-normally distributed observed data. Box-Cox transformation were applied 
to evaluate if the transformed data more closely follow a normal distribution. Model building resumed 
with use of the Box-Cox transformed data. Re-estimation of parameter values could still not address 
bias in residuals on treatment day one. Attempts were made to include darolutamide concentrations 
below the LLOQ, but this constantly resulted in unstable parameter estimation. Therefore, it was 
Assessment report

decided to omit data below LLOQ during model development. For model development where 
observations <LLOQ were included, the M3 method was used. 
The median age of patients was 67 years (range 41 to 86 years) and the median body weight was 
75.05 kg (range 39 to 144 kg). In total, 52.5 % of the patients were White, 35.9 % were Asian and 
11.6% were categorized as other. Asian and “other” were combined to create the ethnicity covariate 
“white” vs “non-white”. In total, 16.3 % of patients were from Mainland China, 9.9 % from Japan, 7.1 
% from Korea and 2.5 % from Taiwan. Further to this, 16.5% patients were from the USA. The median 
baseline serum creatinine level was 0.88 mg/dL (range 0.4 to 2.39 mg/dL) and median estimated 
glomerular filtration rate at baseline was 92.75 mL/min (range 16.37 to 230.59 mL/min). The median 
baseline total bilirubin level was 0.53 mg/dL (range 0.04 to 1.95 mg/dL), median aspartate 
transaminase (AST) level was 24 U/L (range 7.95 to 79.8 U/L) and median alanine transaminase (ALT) 
was 24 U/L (range 1 to 161.6 U/L). In total, 92.2% of patients had normal hepatic function, 7.5% of 
patients had mild hepatic impairment and two patients had moderate hepatic impairment. The median 
baseline serum albumin level was 4.3 g/dL (range 2.4 to 6.15 g/dL) and the median baseline total 
protein level was 7.2 g/dL (range 5.2 to 9.11 g/dL).  
Model development and results 
The previously developed population PK model for nmCRCP patients was used. Parameters were re-
estimated for study 17777 ARASENS data. Covariates were investigated using the forward inclusion 
(ΔOFV ≤10.828, p < 0.001, 1 degree of freedom) and backward elimination procedure (ΔOFV > 
+15.137, p > 0.001, 1 degree of freedom). Model selection criteria included commonly used methods 
like goodness-of-fit (GOF) plots, precision and plausibility of parameter estimates. For model 
qualification prediction-corrected visual predictive checks (pcVPC) were carried out (1000 replicates). 
For docetaxel, a literature model was used (please refer to section “Pharmacokinetic interaction 
studies”).  
Parameter estimates of the final population PK model for darolutamide in study 17777 ARASENS are 
shown in Table 6. Bootstrap results are given in Table 7. VPCs are presented in Figure 2, Figure 3, 
and Figure 4. The model structure remained the same as the previously model structure. The 
population typical CL was 4.88 L/h (IIV = 41.5 %CV) and the total volume of distribution for all three 
analyses was 32.7 L (IIV = 117 %CV). ETA shrinkages were below 10.2 %. The absorption of 
darolutamide was described by several (inter-connected) processes due to the interconversion of the 
diastereomers via keto-darolutamide. Keto-darolutamide was more rapidly absorbed (KA3=0.26 h-1) 
compared to (S,R)-darolutamide (KA1 = 0.06 h-1) and R,S-darolutamide (KA2 = 0.006 h-1). Following 
absorption, keto-darolutamide was rapidly interconverted back to (S,R)- and (mainly) (S,S)-
darolutamide. As a result, the model predicted a much faster occurrence of (S,R)- and (S,S)-
darolutamide, as reflected by the Tmax (3.33 h (18.4%,1.35–4.59)) estimates, in the plasma/central 
compartment as the estimated KA1 and KA2 values might suggest. Parameter KRET (estimate: 0.475) 
represented the ratio between the transformation rate of (S,S)- or (S,R)-darolutamide to keto-
darolutamide and the transformation rate of keto-darolutamide back to (S,S)- or (S,R)-darolutamide. 
It informed about the net transformation of darolutamide to keto-darolutamide or vice versa. Age, 
Japanese, and Chinese were identified as statistically significantly covariates. As such, CL increased by 
approximately 26.3 % for patients under 65 versus patients ≥ 65 years, Japanese having a CL 32 % 
lower than patients from the rest of regions (excluding Mainland China) and patients in Mainland China 
having a CL 19.7% lower than patients from the rest of regions (excluding Japan). Residual variability 
varied between 14 – 35 %. Relative standard error (RSE) was below 26 %.

This meta-analysis was done using pooled data from study 17777 ARASENS and study 17712 ARMAIS 
to (1) evaluate the contribution of pre-defined covariates to the variability in darolutamide PK in the 
combined data, and (2) to assess the extent to which differences in darolutamide exposure between 
both studies is accounted for by differences in population characteristics.

The population PK base model for Study 17777 was used and inter-individual variability (IIV) and 
covariates were re-estimated. The ratio of the model-derived geometric mean AUC(0- 12)ss value for 
Study 17777 versus 17712 was calculated for each analyte (bootstrap analysis). Additional IIV were 
identified for the rate at which keto is transformed to (S,S)-darolutamide or (S,R)-darolutamide 
(KRET) and RR as well as the following covariates: Age, Asian, and Japanese on CL, China on V, serum 
creatinine at baseline, body weight on KRET (i.e. scaling parameter for rate of conversion from keto to 
(S,R) and (S,S) darolutamide), and age, and AST on RR (i.e. conversion ratio of keto-darolutamide to 
either (S,R)-darolutamide or (S,S)- darolutamide). Parameter estimates of the population PK meta-

compared to patients with normal renal function. These results are consistent with previous findings 
from study 17712 ARAMIS in patients with nmCRPC. 
No new information was provided regarding patients with end-stage renal disease receiving dialysis. 
Hepatic impairment 
The population PK analysis using data from Study 17777 ARASENS in patients with mHSPC reported a 
similar exposure in patients with mild hepatic impairment (mean geometric ratio 0.977 [90 % CI: 
0.879 – 1.08]) compared to patients with normal hepatic function. These results are consistent with 
previous findings from study 17712 ARAMIS in patients with nmCRPC.  
Gender 
Not applicable. 
Race/Ethnicity 
The population PK analysis using data from Study 17777 ARASENS in patients with mHSPC reported a 
higher increase in exposure (AUC(0–12)ss) for Japanese patients (mean ratio compared to rest of regions 
= 1.56 (90%CI: 1.43 – 1.70) as compared to the previous analysis of data from study 17712 ARAMIS 
(mean ratio compared to rest of regions =1.42 (90%CI: 1.33 - 1.53)). 
Body weight 
Results for body weight effects on exposure of darolutamide from the population PK analysis using 
data from Study 17777 ARASENS in patients with mHSPC were consistent with previous findings from 
study 17712 ARAMIS in patients with nmCRPC. 
Elderly 
The population PK analysis using data from Study 17777 ARASENS in patients with mHSPC reported 
that mean exposure (AUC(0-12)ss) for patients aged 65 - <75 years was about 1.28-fold (90%CI: 1.22– 
1.34) higher and for patients aged 75 - < 85 about 1.34-fold (90% CI: 1.25 – 1.49) higher compared 
to patients aged < 65 years. The ratio was similar for patients aged ≥85 years compared to the age 
group 75 - < 85. However only three patients were aged above 85 years of age. 
Results for the age group 65 - <75 years were slightly lower compared to those from study 17712 
ARAMIS in patients with nmCRPC, but were generally comparable and consistent.

Docetaxel population PK model  
Study number:  CPMX50017 / report R-13408, report date 10 January 2022 
Individual docetaxel clearance and exposure were investigated using an established literature 
population PK model. Docetaxel clearance between the two treatment arms (with or without 
darolutamide) in study 17777 ARASENS were assessed and the correlation between darolutamide and 
docetaxel clearance on an individual level was evaluated. 
Assessment report  
EMA/80060/2023  
Page 30/147 
 
 
 
 
Overall, 1152 patients with 2135 plasma PK samples above and 225 samples below LLOQ contributed 
to the analysis. The final population PK model for docetaxel is a 3-compartment model with linear 
elimination. The parameters were re-estimated based on study 17777 PK data. Parameter estimates 
from the final model for study 17777 are listed in Table 13. All covariates in the docetaxel literature 
model were identified for study 17777 data, with the exception of α1-acid glycoprotein (AAG). AAG 
was fixed to the median value provided in the literature. The remaining covariates on CL were body 
surface area (BSA, calculated using the DuBois method), albumin, age and hepatic function (called 
HEP12).  
Based on the GOF plots DV versus Population Predicted Value (PRED) and pc-VPC, the population PK 
model of docetaxel is biased on the structural (PRED) predictions. Taking into account that the 
objective of the docetaxel population PK modelling was to estimate individual clearance and exposure 
of docetaxel in Study 17777, the bias on the population level was considered acceptable. The GOF 
plots for the individual weighted residuals (IWRES) were considered to show a lack of bias in the 
individual predictions, and it was concluded that the literature model was fit-for-purpose to estimate 
individual clearance and exposure of docetaxel in Study 17777. 
Summary statistics of individual estimates of docetaxel clearance stratified by treatment arm are 
presented in Table 14 and box plots showing docetaxel concentrations versus time after dose are 
stratified by treatment arm are presented in Figure 5.

2.3.3.  PK/PD modelling 
Population PK/PD modelling for efficacy (study 17777 ARASENS)  
Study number: CPMX50018 / report R-13397, report date 31 December 2021 
An exploratory population pharmacodynamic (PD) analysis of change in prostate specific antigen over 
time in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer of study 17777. 
Objectives 
This study aimed to describe the change in prostate specific antigen (PSA) over time by means of a 
semi-mechanistic model, investigate covariates, and evaluate the multivariate relationship between 
darolutamide and/or active metabolite exposure, docetaxel exposure and the change in PSA over time. 
In addition, the potential relationship between the change in testosterone over time and darolutamide 
exposure was investigated using exploratory analysis. Furthermore, the association between the time-
course of PSA and overall survival was visualised (means of Kaplan Meier curves per quartile of change 
in PSA and curves per quartile of darolutamide exposure). 
Data and methods 
Data below LLOQ (BLQ) under treatment were included in the dataset. Measurements with no recorded 
sample time and vice versa were excluded. Missing continuous and categorical baseline covariate data 
were in general either filled with the population median value or most frequent category across study 
17777. The dataset considered for this analysis contained all patients of study 17777 who received at 
least one dose of study drug, either darolutamide or control. 
Nonlinear mixed-effects modelling using NONMEM software version 7.4.3 was used. 
Exposure variables were calculated based on the population PK models described in report CPMX50017 
/ report R-13408, report date 10 January 2022. Different exposure variables were tested. 
A previous developed model was used as a starting point to investigate the PKPD relationship with 
PSA: BAY 1841788 (darolutamide) / 19792. Exploratory population pharmacodynamic analysis of 
change in prostate specific antigen over time in studies 17712, 17829 and 17830. M&S Report R-
12788, Version 1.0, dated 08 JAN 2019. The base model described the growth of prostate cancer cells 
by means of a tumour cell proliferation and kill rate. Furthermore, the model described the secretion of 
PSA in the blood by the tumour cells and the elimination of PSA from the blood. Covariates were 
investigated using the forward inclusion (ΔOFV ≤ 6.67, p < 0.01, 1 degree of freedom) and backward 
elimination procedure (ΔOFV > +10.828, p > 0.001, 1 degree of freedom). Model evaluation and 
qualification was done using generally applied methods (e.g. GOF plots, precision of parameter 
estimates, VPCs). The final covariate model was used to calculate the predicted reduction in PSA from 
baseline at different time-points. It was assumed that PSA concentrations in blood were at steady state 
at the start of treatment. 
Change of testosterone over time was investigated using exploratory plots (i.e. spaghetti plots). 
The potential relationships between darolutamide exposure and overall survival was explored through 
different Kaplan Meier plots. 
Instantaneous concentration of docetaxel was not tested due to only a single PSA data-point being 
available during the docetaxel phase for the majority of patients. Instead, four docetaxel covariates 
were tested: Total docetaxel dose, average docetaxel dose, total docetaxel AUC and average docetaxel 
AUC.

Results 
The darolutamide exposure variables at steady state for the 647 patients of study 17777 (initial data) 
and docetaxel exposure variables for the 1280 patients of study 17777 (initial data) were predicted 
based on the population PK models as described in CPMX50017 / report R-13408, report date 10 
January 2022.

PSA 
Data used in the inference of the selected covariate model onto the final data, resulting in the final 
covariate model, included 13994 PSA observations from 1302 patients who received at least one dose 
of study drug. Compared to the initial data, one patient was removed from the data due to a serious 
data breach. Overall, 12693 post-baseline PSA observations were used for model inference. Of these 
12693 post-baseline PSA observations, 3726 (29.4%) were below the LLOQ.  
Parameter estimates of the final PD model for PSA are listed in Table 15.

Darolutamide and docetaxel exposure did not result in a statistically significant covariate in the PD 
model. Baseline PSA, haemoglobin, alkaline phosphatase and three Asian geographic region China, 
Japan, and Korea, were found to influence PSA time course.  
Darolutamide-treated patients were found to be associated with a greater and longer lasting PSA 
reduction compared to control patients. The difference in the fraction of patients with ≥ 90% reduction 
in PSA from baseline at week 24 between darolutamide-treated and control groups is consistent in sub-
groups defined by age, race, geographical region, renal function, hepatic function and bodyweight. 
Also, dose reductions or interruptions for darolutamide-treated patients are not expected to affect PSA 
response. The PSA time-course was consistent over the darolutamide exposure range after 600 mg 
BID. Differences in docetaxel exposure were not found to influence PSA time course.  
Despite of some deficiencies in the model, overall, it is considered to support darolutamide efficacy in 
patients from study 17777 ARASENS. 
• 
Testosterone 
Data used in the exploratory model-free analysis of the time-course of total testosterone included 
11240 observations from 1303 patients. Of these, 8792 (78.2%) were below the LLOQ. The data file 
also included 2246 free testosterone observations from 597 patients. Of these, 91 (4.05%) were below 
the LLOQ. Spaghetti plot of the time-course of total testosterone were carried out. No differences in 
the time-course of total testosterone between darolutamide-treated and control patients were 
observed. 
•  Kaplan Meier plots of overall survival 
Exploratory Kaplan Meier plots of overall survival were carried out and indicated:

Population PK/PD modelling for safety (study 17777 ARASENS) 
Study number: CPMX50020 / report R-14071, report date 12 January 2022 
Exploratory exposure-response analysis of relevant safety events in patients with metastatic hormone-
sensitive prostate cancer of study 17777. 
Objectives 
Evaluate the association between darolutamide and docetaxel exposure and the temporal changes in 
absolute neutrophil count, AST, ALT, total bilirubin, haemoglobin, and selected treatment emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) with an overall event rate greater than 10% in the data of Study 17777. 
Data and methods 
Nonlinear mixed-effects modelling using NONMEM software version 7.4.3 was used, following a visual 
inspection of the data. The starting point for the development of the base model for each PD safety 
variable was a turnover type model and different models were considered if deemed necessary. 
Covariates were investigated using the forward inclusion (ΔOFV ≤ 6.67, p < 0.01, 1 degree of 
freedom) and backward elimination procedure (ΔOFV > +10.828, p > 0.001, 1 degree of freedom). 
Model evaluation and qualification was done using generally applied methods. 
Results 
Different datasets were created. After updating the dataset with additional neutrophil count 
observations it contained a total of 100852 observations in 1303 patients who received at least one 
dose of study drug. 
The median age of patients was 67 years (range 41-89). In total, 36.5% of patients were aged < 
65 years, 46.7% were aged 65-74, 16.3% were aged 75-84 and 0.5% were aged ≥85 at the start of 
the study. In order to meet the 15% frequency requirement for a covariate category to be investigated 
in models, the age categories 75-84 and ≥85 were combined into a single ≥75 category. A total of 
63.5 % of patients were aged ≥65. 
Overall, 15.5% of patients were from mainland China, 11.3% were from Japan, 6.5% were from 
Korea. 2.8% were from Taiwan, 16.6% were from USA and 47.2% were from the rest of regions. All 
regions were tested independently despite Japan, Korea and Taiwan not reaching the 15% 
requirement. 
In total, 54.1% of patients had a normal renal function, 36.8% mild, 9.1% moderate, and 0.2% severe 
renal impairment. To meet the 15% frequency requirement, the categories ‘mild’, ‘moderate’ and 
‘severe’ were combined into a single ‘mild or worse’ category for covariate testing. In total, 92.2% of 
patients had a normal hepatic function, 7.6% mild and 0.2% moderate hepatic impairment. 
Bone metastases were found in 79.7% of patients, 17.3% had visceral metastases and 3% had non-
regional lymph node metastases only. To meet the 15% frequency requirement, the visceral 
metastases and non-regional lymph node metastases only categories were combined into a single 
category. Overall, 71.8% of patients had ECOG=0 and 28.2% had ECOG=1. 
•  Absolute neutrophil count 
In total, 21208 absolute neutrophil counts from 1303 patients were analysed.The final model is a five-
compartment model with three transit compartments and contains the neutrophil production as well as 
a feedback loop from blood concentration. The effect of docetaxel on neutrophil production is also 
reflected in the model by each a zero- and first order constant. Neutrophil suppression was found to be 
different between patients depending on geographical regions (China, USA, Japan, and Korea).

Slight differences due to region or race were established. The proportion of patients with neutropenia 
grade 3 and grade 4 based on the region or race, stratified by treatment arm are shown in Table 17. 
Higher incidences were reported in patients from the Asia Pacific region compared with patients from 
North America and rest of the world (ROW) in both treatment arms. These observed differences in 
Grade 3 or 4 neutrophil count decreased among geographical regions were generally consistent with 
the assessment of the typical patient’s profile of absolute neutrophil count predicted by the PK-PD 
model, and are generally consistent in both treatment arms.

Parameter of the final model estimates are listed in Table 18.The typical percentage change in AST 
across all patients is shown in Table 19. AST concentration was found to be reduced during docetaxel 
treatment in both study arms. No other patient characteristics were found to influence AST. 
Differences in docetaxel exposure were not found to AST. No differences between darolutamide and 
control patients were identified.

The typical percentage change in AST across all patients is shown in Table 23. Total bilirubin was found 
to be reduced during docetaxel treatment in both study arms. Older patients and patients from Japan, 
Korea or mainland China were associated with increased total bilirubin. Darolutamide treatment was 
found to be associated with increased bilirubin levels over control, with model-predicted 0.1% (90% CI 
-8.6 to 24.7) increase from baseline after one year of treatment for a typical darolutamide-treated 
patient versus -12.1% (90% CI - 19.9 to 10.3) reduction from baseline for a typical control patient. 
The association with darolutamide treatment was consistent across the darolutamide exposure range 
at 600 mg BID.

Figure 11: VPC of hemoglobin final model for darolutamide (left) and placebo (right) treated 
patients of Study 17777 
Haemoglobin was found to be reduced during docetaxel treatment in both study arms. The reduction in 
haemoglobin due to docetaxel treatment was more pronounced in those with higher docetaxel 
exposure, older patients, patients from Japan and patients from China. After haemoglobin levels 
recovered from docetaxel treatment, darolutamide treated patients continued to be associated with 
lower haemoglobin levels than control patients for the remainder of the study, although the model-
predicted difference is small with a -4.5% (90% CI - 8.1 to 1.0) reduction from baseline one year after 
treatment start for a typical darolutamide-treated patient versus -2.4% (90% CI -5.9 to 0.77) 
reduction from baseline for a typical control patient). The same applies for older versus younger 
patients and patients from Korea versus not from Korea. 
For patients from Japan, on average, 1.56-fold higher exposure in these patients did not result in a 
different change in haemoglobin over time compared with patients from the rest of the regions. The 
predicted change in haemoglobin after 1 year in the darolutamide + docetaxel arm was −5.6% (90% 
CI: [−7.9%; −2.2%]) in a typical Japanese patient vs. −4.3% (90% CI: [−7.3%; −0.7%]) in a typical 
rest of the regions patient and a comparable difference between a Japanese vs. rest of the regions 
patient was observed in the placebo + docetaxel arm, i.e., −3.3% (90% CI: [−6%; −0.1%]) vs. 
−2.4% (90% CI: [−5.4%; +1.1%], respectively. Similarly, the 1.27-fold higher exposure in patients 
from mainland China vs. rest of the regions was not associated with differences in haemoglobin 
decrease. While the predicted change in haemoglobin after 1 year was −4.4% (90% CI: [−6.8%, 
−1.6%) in a typical patient from mainland China vs. −4.3% (90% CI: [−7.3%; −0.7%]) in a typical 
rest of the regions patient, a comparable difference between a patient from mainland China vs. a rest 
of the regions patient was observed in the placebo + docetaxel arm, i.e., −2.4% (90% CI: [−5.1%, 
+1.2%]) vs. −2.4% (90% CI: [−5.4%; +1.1%], respectively.

• 
Population PK modelling darolutamide 
Although some slight misspecifications in the pc-VPC were identified for (S,R)-darolutamide, overall, 
the population PK model is considered fit-for-purpose to inform on PK characteristics and exposure-
response relationships.  
•  Comparison of studies 17777 ARASENS and 17712 ARAMIS 
Based on PK analyses systemic exposure was shown to be generally lower and the PK more variable in 
patients with mHSPC in study ARASENS compared to patients with nmCRPC in study ARAMIS. 
However, this difference does not appear to be attributed to the cancer type but to other patient 
characteristics (e.g. age, body weight). Therefore, the PK of darolutamide is considered to be generally 
comparable between mHSPC and nmCRPC patients. Available data from study 17777 ARASENS 
suggested a higher increase in exposure (AUC(0–12)ss) for Japanese patients (mean ratio compared to 
rest of regions = 1.56 (90%CI: 1.43 – 1.70) as compared to the previous analysis of data from study 
17712 ARAMIS (mean ratio compared to rest of regions =1.42 (90%CI: 1.33 - 1.53)). See section 5.2 
of the SmPC.

Population PK modelling of docetaxel and effect of darolutamide on PK of docetaxel 
Based on the presented results, darolutamide 600 mg BID orally administered resulted in no clinically 
relevant changes in the systemic exposure of docetaxel (75 mg/mg2 as 1 hour IV infusion every 21 
days) in mHSPC patients.

PK/PD modelling for efficacy and safety 
Modelling aspects 
Several PK/PD models have been developed to characterise the time course of darolutamide, 
docetaxel, PSA, neutrophil count, ALT, ALT, bilirubin and haemoglobin. 
Although adequate PK data were limited, the current analysis reveals the ability of the model to 
capture the time-course of PSA over time and relevant covariates to explain differences among groups. 
No clear relationship between darolutamide exposure and PSA response was identified. 
Exploratory analysis suggested no differences in time-course of total testosterone between 
darolutamide-treated and control patients. 
Regarding neutrophil count, ALT, AST, bilirubin, and haemoglobin, no relevant differences on model 
performance was observed across the different treatment arms (refer to VPCs), suggesting that the 
model adequately captures the pharmacodynamic endpoints (neutrophil count, ALT, AST, bilirubin, and 
haemoglobin) on each arm. 
The justification of including an alpha parameter, which represents the fraction of the correlation 
between Kin or Kout in the AST and ALT model is not completely understood, although it seems to 
improve the prediction of the AST and ALT time-course data. The sparse data available and the 
identification of three parameters of the turn-over model may be explained by non-steady state 
conditions of patients before initiating treatment or no relevant information of baseline AST and ALT 
values collected. Therefore, the estimation of baseline of AST and ALT together with Kin and Kout is 
supported to address the non-steady-state conditions of patients.  
The Applicant recognized the inability to incorporate longitudinal predicted concentrations of docetaxel 
to predict AST, ALT, and bilirubin profiles over time. Although the PK/PD model captures the observed 
data, no relevant information is incorporated to understand how changes in docetaxel exposure may 
affect the response time-course. Therefore, simulation-based analyses to support changes in docetaxel 
dose level or schedule are of limited information. 
Neutrophil count, ALT, ALT, bilirubin and haemoglobin 
Differences in neutrophil suppression due to docetaxel treatment in both study arms were identified for 
patients in different geographical regions (China, USA, Japan, and Korea). A slightly higher incidence 
of neutropenia Grade 3 / 4 in the placebo + docetaxel arm was observed versus the darolutamide + 
docetaxel arm.  
AST and ALT concentrations were reduced during docetaxel treatment in both study arms. Older 
patients and patients from Japan or mainland China were associated with decreasing ALT levels. 
Differences in docetaxel exposure were not associated with changes in ALT levels. Overall, no 
differences between darolutamide and control patients were identified for AST and ALT. 
Total bilirubin was reduced during docetaxel treatment in both study arms. Older patients and patients 
from Japan, Korea or mainland China were associated with increased total bilirubin. Darolutamide 
treatment was associated with increased bilirubin levels consistent across the darolutamide exposure 
range at 600 mg BID. 
The co-administration of darolutamide with docetaxel was shown to reduce the decrease on bilirubin 
(BIL) level compared to docetaxel only. Although no definitive conclusions could be established 
regarding the mechanism involved in bilirubin change after darolutamide, it has been hypothesized 
that the inhibition of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 by darolutamide may play a role, leading to higher BIL 
levels.

Haemoglobin was reduced during docetaxel treatment in both study arms. The reduction in 
haemoglobin due to docetaxel treatment was more pronounced in those with higher docetaxel 
exposure, older patients, patients from Japan and patients from China. Darolutamide treatment was 
also associated with reduced haemoglobin levels. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK of darolutamide appear generally comparable between mHSPC and nmCRPC patients.  
Overall, the adequacy of the current PK/PD model to describe the observed (response) data is 
supported. However, it should be highlighted that the current PK/PD models developed for each PD 
outcome did not take into account how changes in darolutamide or docetaxel exposure may affect the 
PD outcome. Therefore, although several covariates were statistically identified to explain differences 
in PD response over time, the PK/PD models were not suitable to support any dose schedule 
modification since it is not possible to estimate how differences in exposure may translate into the PD 
outcome.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
The  selected  dose  of  darolutamide  in  ARASENS  study  is  600  mg  bd  tablets  which  is  the same  as  the 
selected  dose  for  the  currently  approved  indication  in  the  treatment  of  patients  with  non-metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC). 
The  600  mg  bd  dose  of  tablet  formulation  for  treatment  of  patients  with  mHSPC  in  combination  with 
docetaxel was primarily supported by a popPK meta-analysis and data of Study 17777.  
2.4.2.  Main study(ies) 
Study ARASENS  
Study ARASENS is a randomized, double–blind, placebo–controlled Phase III study of darolutamide 
(ODM–201) versus placebo in addition to standard androgen deprivation therapy and docetaxel in 
patients with metastatic hormone–sensitive prostate cancer.

Treatments 
Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the treatments as specified below:  
-  Darolutamide tablets orally 600 mg [2 x 300 mg tablets] twice daily [bd], tablet formulation 
combined with docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg/m2 as an IV infusion every 21 days for 6 cycles, 
starting within 6 weeks after the start of study drug. 
-  Placebo tablets orally combined with docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg/m2 as an IV infusion every 21 
days for 6 cycles, starting within 6 weeks after the start of study drug. 
Docetaxel could be administered in combination with prednisone/prednisolone at the discretion of the 
Investigator. To prevent hypersensitivity reactions and fluid retention, the recommended pre–medication 
regimen was oral dexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, 3 hours and 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion. 
Anti-emetic regimens are recommended as per local clinical practice. 
Treatment was administered until disease progression (symptomatic progressive disease, change of 
antineoplastic therapy), unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal or withdrawal from the study at the 
discretion of the Investigator or his/her designated associate(s), death, or non–compliance. 
Objectives and endpoints 
Table 26 : Objectives and endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
Definition 
Overall survival (OS) 
Time from the date of randomization until death from any cause. 
OS of patients not known to have died was censored at their last date of being known to be 
alive or at the database cut-off date, whichever came first. 
Secondary endpoints 
Time to castration-
resistant prostate 
cancer 
Time from randomization to the first occurrence of one of the following events: 
•  PSA progression, according to PCWG3 criteria with serum testosterone being at 
castrate level <0.50 ng/mL; defined as the date that a 25% or greater increase and an 
absolute increase of 2 ng/mL or more from the nadir (lowest at or after baseline) was 
documented, both of which were confirmed by a second value obtained at least 3 
weeks later, including all potential PSA values ≥2 ng/mL above nadir and ≥25% 
increase above nadir between the initial assessment date and the confirmation 
assessment date. This definition required serum testosterone at castrate levels 
<0.50 ng/mL and a first assessment date at least 12 weeks from randomization. The 
analysis was based on PSA and testosterone assessments from the central laboratory. 
However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some PSA assessments were performed at 
local laboratories. 
•  Radiological progression by soft tissue and visceral lesions; defined according to 
RECIST v1.1, based on MRI/CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed by 
the investigator, as recommended by PCWG3 
•  Radiological progression by bone lesions; defined according to PCWG3 criteria based 
on whole body 99mTc methylene diphosphonate bone scans performed by the 
investigator.

Time to pain progression  Time from randomization to the first date a patient experienced pain progression. 
Pain progression was defined as: 
•  For asymptomatic patients (worst pain subscale [WPS] = 0 at baseline, as assessed 
using the BPI-SF questionnaire [ePRO device]): 
-  An increase of 2 or more points in the “worst pain in 24 hours” score (ie, 2 or more 
point increase in WPS score) from nadir (ie, zero) observed at 2 consecutive 
evaluations ≥4 weeks apart, or 
-  Initiation of short- or long-acting opioid use for pain 
•  For symptomatic patients (WPS >0 at baseline): 
-  An increase of 2 or more points in the “worst pain in 24 hours” score (ie, 2 or more 
point increase in WPS score) from nadir observed at 2 consecutive evaluations ≥4 
weeks apart and a WPS of ≥4, or 
-  Initiation of short- or long-acting opioid use for pain 
Time from randomization to the first occurrence of an SSE or death from any cause, 
whichever came first. 
An SSE was defined as the occurrence of one of the following: 
•  Administration of EBRT to relieve skeletal symptoms, or 
•  New symptomatic pathologic bone fracture, or 
•  Spinal cord compression, or 
•  Tumor-related orthopedic surgical intervention 
Symptomatic skeletal 
event-free survival 
(SSE-FS) 
Time to first symptomatic 
skeletal event (SSE) 
Time from randomization to the first occurrence of an SSE. Death was not considered as 
an event.  
Time to initiation of 
subsequent systemic 
antineoplastic therapy 
Time from randomization to initiation of the first subsequent systemic antineoplastic 
therapy. Patients in the study may have received subsequent antineoplastic therapy for 
prostate cancer or for additional primary malignancies. Systemic antineoplastic therapy 
treatment was selected as described in the SAP. 
Time to worsening of 
disease-related 
physical symptoms 
Time from randomization to the first date a patient experienced an increase in disease-
related physical symptoms based on the NCCN-FACT-FPSI-17 questionnaire (ePRO 
device). 
An increase in disease-related physical symptoms was defined as a 3-point decrease in 
the FPSI-DRS-P subscale from baseline (a lower score indicates a higher symptom 
burden), observed at 2 consecutive evaluations ≥4 weeks apart. 
Time to initiation of 
Time from randomization to the date of first opioid use for ≥7 consecutive days. 
opioid use for 
≥7 consecutive days 
Exploratory endpoints 
Opioid use related to prostate cancer pain was included in the analysis, while opioid use for 
non-malignant cause(s) was excluded. 
Time to PSA progression  Time from randomization to the date of first PSA progression (with testosterone at castrate 
level <0.5 ng/mL). 
The definition of PSA progression is the same as described above for the time to 
castration-resistant prostate cancer endpoint. 
Rates of absolute and 
relative PSA response 
Rate of response was determined by the number of patients with PSA response divided by 
the total number of patients randomized. 
•  Absolute PSA response (evaluated at 6 and 12 months after randomization) was 
defined as a baseline PSA value above the detection limit and a post-baseline PSA 
level below 0.2 ng/mL, confirmed by a second subsequent PSA value below 0.2 ng/mL 
3 or more weeks later, with all potential PSA values between the initial date and 
confirmation date below 0.2 ng/mL. 
•  Relative 30% PSA response (evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months after randomization) 
was defined as a baseline PSA value above the detection limit and a post-baseline 
≥30% reduction in PSA level compared with the baseline value, confirmed by a second 
subsequent PSA value with a ≥30% reduction from baseline 3 or more weeks later, with 
all potential PSA values between the initial date and confirmation date showing a ≥30% 
reduction from baseline. Relative 50% and 90% PSA response were defined in the 
same way. 
In addition, descriptive statistics and frequency distribution (no decline, <30%, 30% to 
<50%, 50% to <90%, ≥90%) are provided for PSA maximum percent decline from baseline 
at any time on study.

Sample size 
The sample size of the study was based on the primary endpoint of OS. The study was designed to have 
90% power to detect a 25% decrease in risk of death with darolutamide compared with placebo with a 
one-sided test with a type I error of 0.025 (equivalent to a two-sided test with a type I error 0.05). The 
OS data were considered mature when approximately 509 deaths are observed. 
With  the  additional  assumptions  that  patients  were  enrolled  at  a  rate  of  50  patients  per  month, 
exponential distributions of the OS event times, median time of OS in the placebo group of 60 months, 
5% dropout rate of patients, and a 6-months enrolment ramp-up period, it followed that approximately 
1,300 patients were required to be randomized to observe 509 deaths after approximately 70 months. 
Interim analysis 
A futility interim analysis was planned. For the futility interim and final analyses together, a one-sided 
overall  beta  of  0.1  was  used.  Stopping  boundaries  were  calculated  with  an  O’Brien-Fleming  beta-
spending function using the actual number of events observed up to the cut-off date. The interim futility 
analysis  was  planned  when  approximately  153  deaths  were  observed  (information  fraction=0.3).  The 
critical boundary for the futility analysis was calculated separately from the efficacy boundary, in order 
to not interfere with the type I error of the efficacy analysis. 
Stopping boundaries for interim analysis 
A second interim analysis was initially planned, which included a stopping boundary for efficacy 
calculated based on an alpha-spending function. It was removed with protocol amendment 7 (26 May 
2020) due to the implications of the COVID–19 pandemic on the conduct of study procedures and data 
collection at the study sites.  
Assessment report  
EMA/80060/2023  
Page 54/147 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The 1st interim analysis was completed and its stopping boundaries were calculated before the 
decision was made to remove the 2nd interim analysis. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomly assigned on a 1:1 basis in a blinded fashion to treatment with darolutamide or 
matching placebo plus ADT and docetaxel. In addition, randomisation was stratified by: 
• 
Extent of disease 
o  Non–regional lymph nodes metastases only 
o  Bone metastases with or without lymph node metastases 
o  Visceral metastases with or without lymph node metastases or with or without bone 
metastases 
•  Alkaline Phosphatase 
o  ALP<ULN 
o  ALP≥ULN 
Note: Blood samples to measure ALP levels for stratification were analysed in a central laboratory. 
Blinding (masking) 
Study  ARESENS  was  a  double-blind  study.  Both  investigators  and  patients  remained  blinded  to 
randomised treatment for the study duration.  
Data monitoring committee (DMC) 
A DMC was instituted to monitor ongoing safety of study patients with respect to a risk/benefit 
assessment during periodic data review meetings, review results from planned interim analyses and 
provide a formal recommendation for continuation/termination of the study and monitor study conduct 
to ensure the overall integrity of study was maintained. The DMC was to operate independently of the 
MAH and Investigators. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis populations 
The Full Analysis Set was used for the analysis of all efficacy endpoints and all other endpoints. The 
Safety Analysis Set was used for the analyses of all safety endpoints. The pharmacokinetic data was 
analysed in the pharmacokinetic analysis set (PKS). 
Full analysis set (FAS) 
All patients who were randomized were included in the FAS, except for cases with critical GCP 
violations. Following the intent-to-treat principle, the patients in this set were grouped according to the 
planned treatment they were allocated to receive at randomization, irrespective of actual treatment. 
Safety analysis set (SAF) 
All randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of darolutamide or placebo were included in the 
SAF, except for cases with critical GCP violations. This safety population was used in the analyses of all 
Assessment report  
EMA/80060/2023

safety endpoints and was included in the analyses according to the treatment they actually received. 
Patients were included in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm if they had received any dose of 
darolutamide and were included in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm if they received only placebo. 
Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set (PKS) 
At least the first 20 randomized patients who received at least 1 cycle of docetaxel and for whom 
mandatory dense PK sampling was performed were included in the PKS. These patients received at 
least 3 days of uninterrupted study drug treatment, as well as one cycle of docetaxel and had at least 
one post-dose PK measurement, except for cases with critical GCP violations. 
Multiplicity adjustment 
If the primary endpoint OS was statistically significant at a 0.025 level (one-sided), the secondary 
endpoints were to be tested using a hierarchical test procedure in the order below at the same nominal 
significance level.  
1) Time to castration-resistant prostate cancer 
2) Time to pain progression 
3) Symptomatic skeletal event free survival (SSE-FS) 
4) Time to first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE) 
5) Time to initiation of subsequent systemic antineoplastic therapy 
6) Time to worsening of disease-related physical symptoms based on functional assessment of cancer 
therapy / National Comprehensive Cancer Network prostate cancer symptom index 17 item 
questionnaire (NCCN-FACT FPSI-17) 
7) Time to initiation of opioid use for ≥ 7 consecutive days 
If OS or a secondary endpoint was not statistically significant, the hierarchical procedure was stopped, 
and all subsequent analyses of the secondary endpoints were to be considered exploratory. 
Interim analysis considerations 
As described in the sample size section, a futility IA (not impacting the study type I error) was planned 
when approximately 153 deaths were observed (information fraction=0.3).  This IA was completed. 
A second interim analysis which included a stopping boundary for efficacy calculated based on an 
alpha-spending function was initially planned but was removed with protocol amendment 7 (26 May 
2020) due to the implications of the COVID–19 pandemic on the conduct of study procedures and data 
collection at the study sites.   
As a consequence, no alpha-spending function was used and the final analysis was performed using a 
one-sided test with a type I error of 0.025. 
Primary endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was OS, defined as the time from the date of randomization until death 
from any cause. The censoring rules for OS are provided below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/80060/2023  
Page 56/147 
 
 
 
 
The last known alive date (LKAD) was derived from the main data sources, i.e. visit dates, exposure 
information, laboratory measurements, tumor assessment dates, SSE dates, demographics, survival 
status date, vital signs and disposition events or follow up assessments were used to determine 
survival status. 
The primary analysis of OS was a stratified log-rank test with the same IxRS stratification factors as 
were used for randomization. The HR (darolutamide or placebo) for OS and its 95% confidence interval 
(CI) were calculated using the Cox model, stratified by the same factors as were used for 
randomization. If the p-value from the one-sided log-rank test was less than 0.025 (corresponding to a 
two-sided log-rank test less than 0.05) with the HR (darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm vs. placebo 
+ docetaxel + ADT arm) less than 1, the null hypothesis was rejected in favor of the alternative 
hypothesis. 
Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates for the median time of OS (including 95% CI) and 25% and 75% 
percentiles are presented for each treatment arm. KM estimates at time points such as 12 months, 24 
months, etc., together with corresponding 95% CIs and the differences of these estimates between the 
darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm were also presented. 
Sensitivity analyses 
OS was evaluated with the unstratified log-rank test and Cox model for the FAS population (OS 
sensitivity analysis 1 – unstratified analysis). 
OS was to be also evaluated with the stratified log-rank test and Cox model for the FAS population 
using stratification factors collected from the eCRF, in case there were more than 5% of patients with 
different values in any stratification variable between IxRS and eCRF (OS sensitivity analysis 2 – eCRF-
variables stratified analysis). 
In addition, OS was evaluated with the stratified log-rank test and Cox model for the FAS population 
using extent of disease stratification factors collected from the central imaging review (OS sensitivity 
analysis 3 – central imaging review extent of disease as stratification factor). 
Secondary endpoints 
All secondary endpoints were time-to-event variables, which were analyzed using a stratified log-rank 
test with randomization stratification factors using IxRS data. Hazard ratios and 95% CIs were 
provided using the Cox model stratified by the same factors as were used for randomization. 
Median time, 25th and 75th percentiles, and associated 95% CI of KM estimates are presented by 
treatment arm, as well as the number and percentage of censored observations. KM curves were 
generated for each treatment arm.

Subgroup analyses 
Subgroup analyses were conducted for the primary efficacy endpoint OS, based on the FAS population. 
Descriptive statistics and HR estimates with 95% CI were to be provided for the subgroups listed 
below, provided that at least 10 total events are observed within the subgroup across the treatment 
arms. HRs were presented in forest plots. All subgroups analyses were performed using an unstratified 
Cox model.  
•  Stratification Factor based on eCRF: Extent of disease (non-regional lymph nodes metastases 
only, bone metastases with or without lymph node metastases, or visceral metastases with or 
without lymph node metastases or with or without bone metastases) 
•  Stratification Factor based on eCRF: ALP at baseline (<ULN, ≥ULN) 
•  Age category (<65, 65-74, 75-84, ≥85 years) 
•  Race (White, Asian, Black or African American, Other) 
•  Geographical region (North America, Asia Pacific, Rest of the World) 
• 
• 
PSA values (<median of overall population, ≥median of overall population) at baseline 
ECOG PS at baseline (0, 1) 
•  Gleason score (<8, ≥8) at initial diagnosis 
•  Metastases at initial diagnosis (Yes: Stage IV-M1, No: Stage I, IIA, IIB, III, IV-M0) 
Subgroup analysis  
Subgroup analyses were conducted for the primary efficacy endpoint OS, based on the FAS population. 
Descriptive statistics and HR estimates with 95% CI were provided for the subgroups, provided that at 
least 10 total events were observed within the subgroup across both treatment arms. HRs were 
presented in forest plots. All subgroup analyses were performed using an unstratified Cox model. The 
number of patients, the number of events, and KM estimates for the median per arm for all planned 
subgroups were presented in the forest plot.

Protocol deviation  
The number of patients with important protocol deviations in each treatment arm and overall is 
summarised below.  
Table 28 : Important protocol deviations (FAS) 
Changes to planned analyses 
Several changes to planned analyses were implemented with protocol amendments or revisions to the 
statistical analysis plan (SAP). 
A main update to the analysis plan was introduced with protocol amendment 7 (26 May 2020), which 
removed the second planned IA. The rationale provided for its removal was the implications of the 
COVID-19 pandemic for the conduct of study procedures and data collection at the study sites. In 
Assessment report  
EMA/80060/2023  
Page 64/147 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
addition, the secondary endpoints were ranked in a gatekeeping procedure as part of this same 
amendment. 
The removal of the second IA was reflected in the SAP in version 3.0 (26 May 2020). The hierarchical 
gatekeeping procedure was implemented in version 4.0 (dated 22 September 2021) of the SAP. 
With SAP version 4.1 (11 November 2021), a change in the analysis populations was introduced. 
Patients were to be excluded from all FAS, SAF, and PKS if they were related to or associated with any 
critical GCP violations that result in fraudulent patient data. After detection of issues with investigator 
fraud at one site, it was decided to exclude one affected patient from all analysis sets as these data 
could not be trusted.  
Post-hoc analyses were described in a SAP supplement (version 1.0, 4 February 2022), which included 
a set of additional sensitivity analyses for the primary and secondary endpoints: OS by 6 cycles versus 
5 and less cycles, OS by 6 and 5 cycles versus 4 and less cycles, OS including one patient with 
violation of GCP (based on all randomized patients), time to pain progression based on unconfirmed 
pain progression as event, time to pain progression based on 4 or more points increase in WPS score.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary variables 
At the time of the database cut-off date for the primary completion analysis (25 OCT 2021), a total of 
533 OS events had occurred, with 229 deaths (35.2% of patients) in the darolutamide + docetaxel + 
ADT arm and 304 deaths (46.5% of patients) in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm. 
The median follow-up time from randomisation to the last contact or death was 43.7 months in the 
darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and 42.4 months in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm.

QoL of patients during the study was evaluated with the NCCN-FACT-FPSI-17 and the BPI-SF 
questionnaires. The NCCN-FACT-FPSI-17 questionnaire was used to assess symptoms of prostate 
cancer, symptoms of treatment of prostate cancer, and HRQoL in prostate cancer patients. The BPI-SF 
questionnaire was used to assess clinical pain. Results of question 3 in the BPI-SF, “worst pain in 24 
hours,” were used for the analysis of time to pain progression, a secondary efficacy endpoint.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The current application is based on the results of the pivotal study ARASENS (Study 17777). This was a 
Phase  III,  multinational,  randomized  (1:1),  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  evaluating 
darolutamide  600  mg  BID  orally  in  combination  with  6  cycles  of  docetaxel  in  combination  with  ADT. 
Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either darolutamide or placebo, each combined with 
docetaxel. The use of docetaxel in combination with ADT as comparator is acceptable as recommended 
by  ESMO  in  the  treatment  of  mHSPC  (Cancer  of  the  prostate:  ESMO  Clinical  Practice,  Guidelines  for 
diagnosis, treatment and follow-up, volume 31, 25 June 2020).  
Considering  the  study  design,  the  initially  claimed  indication  has  been  modified  to  reflect  that 
darolutamide is administered in combination not only with docetaxel but also with ADT.  
Eligibility criteria are considered acceptable considering the claimed indication. It is noted that patients 
were included in the study regardless of disease volume. Patients were stratified at randomization by 
extent of disease (non-regional lymph node metastases only [M1a]; bones metastases with or without 
lymph node metastases [M1b]; visceral metastases with or without lymph node metastases or with or 
without bone metastases [M1c]) and by alkaline phosphatase (ALP), <ULN or ≥ULN at baseline. The 
addition of radiotherapy may be recommended for some patients according to current guidelines (i.e. 
patients with low volume disease). However, patients receiving treatment with radiotherapy were 
excluded from the study, which is acknowledged taking into account the available evidence at the time 
of study start. According to the protocol, palliative radiation therapy or surgical intervention as needed 
were allowed during study treatment. Treatment with bisphosphonates and denosumab was also 
allowed. 
The dose of darolutamide used in ARASENS study is the 600 mg bd tablet formulation in combination 
with  docetaxel  (75  mg/m2  for  6  cycles).  This  dose  showed  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically 
meaningful  efficacy  benefit  for  mHSPC  patients.  The  data  indicate  that  darolutamide  (600  bd)  plus 
docetaxel  has  an  acceptable  tolerability  profile  when  administered  in  the  proposed  target  patient 
population.  This choice of dose was supported by safety and PK data, exposure-response analyses, and 
exposure-safety analysis. 
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate superiority of darolutamide in combination with 
docetaxel over placebo in combination with docetaxel in OS. The secondary objectives were to evaluate 
the  time  to  castration-resistant  prostate  cancer  (CRPC),  the  time  to  pain  progression,  symptomatic 
skeletal event-free survival (SSE-FS), the time to first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE), the time to 
Assessment report

initiation  of  subsequent  systemic  antineoplastic  therapy,  the  time  to  worsening  of  disease-related 
physical symptoms, the time to initiation of opioid use for ≥7 consecutive days, and to characterize the 
safety of darolutamide in  combination  with docetaxel in mHSPC patients. Overall, the study design is 
considered  acceptable.  The  Applicant  has  mostly  followed  the  CHMP  scientific  advice  except  for  the 
suggestion to add other primary endpoints (rPFS or Time to castrate resistance) considering OS could 
be confounded by further treatment lines given the disease stage. The sponsor did not add any further 
primary  endpoints  but  changed  the  hierarchy  of  secondary  endpoints  by  placing  Time  to  castrate 
resistance first which is acceptable.  
The  sample  size  calculations  were  acceptable.  The  targeted  treatment  effect  on  OS  (HR=0.75)  was 
considered  “meaningful  and  clinically  relevant”  (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/596563/2015).  The  randomisation 
process and associated stratification factors are appropriate.  
Twenty-three patients (10 [1.5%] in the darolutamide arm and 13 patients [2.0%] in the placebo arm) 
never received docetaxel. According to the MAH, after randomization and start of study drug, they were 
no longer considered to be eligible to receive concomitant docetaxel within 6 weeks after start of study 
drug. Since numbers were low and balanced between treatment arms it is not considered that this may 
have impacted the results. 
A relatively large proportion of patients had premature emergency unblinding performed at the study 
site  by  the  investigator  (89  patients  in  total,  26  darolutamide  +  docetaxel  +  ADT  and  63 
placebo+docetaxel). Investigators were unblinding patients to inform the choice of subsequent therapy 
which  was  not  allowed  per  protocol.  The  MAH  clarified  that  premature  unblinding  was  limited  to  the 
investigator and patient, and that study team members remained blinded to treatment allocation until 
the formal study unblinding at the time of analyses.  The impact and potential bias induced by premature 
unblinding on subsequent patient measurements have been discussed and post-hoc analyses have been 
provided  for  two  endpoints  considered  to  be  most  likely  influenced  by  premature  unblinding:  time  to 
pain progression and time to worsening of physical disease-related symptoms. The MAH also clarified 
that 18 patients (2.8%) in the darolutamide+docetaxel arm and 43 (6.6%) in the placebo+docetaxel 
arm  received  at  least  1  subsequent  systemic  antineoplastic  therapy  after  premature  unblinding.  In 
general,  bias  cannot  be  completely  ruled  out  in  the  presence  of  premature  unblinding.  However,  the 
additional information and post-hoc analyses performed (data not shown) provided some reassurance 
on the potential impact on study results. 
For the secondary endpoint of time to castration-resistant prostate cancer, it is noted that data following 
two or more consecutive missing assessments or following the start of subsequent therapy are being 
censored at the last assessment date before these occurrences. The MAH was requested to perform a 
supplemental  analysis  of  time  to  castration-resistant  prostate  cancer  following  a  treatment  policy 
strategy for these intercurrent events (IEs) (start of subsequent therapy, and ≥2 consecutive missing 
assessment), i.e. without censoring data in these situations, and making use of following observations 
instead. The results (not shown) were consistent with the main analysis results.  
The statistical methods for analysing primary and secondary endpoints (stratified log-rank test and Cox 
model) are standard and adequate for these time to event variables. 
There  were  several  changes  to  the  planned  analyses,  including  the  removal  of  the  second  interim 
analysis,  the introduction of  gatekeeping procedure in  the SAP, and the exclusion  of  the patient  data 
with a critical GCP violation. Given the double-blind nature of the study, the review of the amendments 
is not thought to have affected the overall interpretation of the study results.  
Regarding protocol deviations, frequency of important protocol deviations was similar between treatment 
arms  (73.3%  and  73.9%  in  the  darolutamide  and  placebo  arm,  respectively).  The  most  commonly 
Assessment report  
EMA/80060/2023  
Page 93/147 
 
 
 
 
reported were related to procedure deviations (56.8% vs 57.0%) and treatment deviations (36.4% vs 
35.5%).  Of  the  total  number  of  protocol  deviations,  15.8%  and  12.1%,  in  each  treatment  arms, 
respectively, were related to COVID-19 pandemic. However, even if numbers were comparable between 
treatment arms, the rate was considered high. According to the MAH a broad definition of “important 
protocol  deviations”  was  used  in  the  study,  which  somehow  would  explain  the  high  rates  of  protocol 
deviations  reported,  in  addition  to  those  related  to  COVID-19  pandemic.  Detailed  information  on  the 
causes  of  procedure  and  treatment  deviations  was  also  submitted  and  no  major  differences  were 
observed between treatment arms. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Baseline data 
Overall, the baseline demographic and baseline patient and disease characteristics of FAS were generally 
well balanced between the 2 treatment arms. The majority of patients included in the study had high 
volume  disease  (77%),  applying  the  CHAARTED  criteria.  Further,  according  to  inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, patients with brain metastases were allowed to enter the study but there were no patients with 
(known) brain metastasis enrolled in the study.  
Docetaxel could be given with prednisone/prednisolone. According to the information provided by the 
MAH,  18.6%  and  22%  of  patients  in  the  darolutamide  and  placebo  arms,  respectively,  received 
prednisolone while 23.2% and 18.5%, respectively, received prednisone. There were also around 7.5% 
of patients that received methylprednisolone. Further, around 80% of patients received dexamethasone. 
Dexamethasone was given as a premedication according to the above definition in 45.9% (299/651) of 
patients  in  the  darolutamide+docetaxel  arm  and  in  49.4%  (323/654)  in  the  placebo+docetaxel  arm. 
Almost 235 patients in the darolutamide+docetaxel arm and 219 patients in the placebo+docetaxel arm 
received dexamethasone not used as premedication according to the predefined time window: a start 
date within 3 days prior to any docetaxel cycle treatment (Day-3), and a stop date within 5 days after 
each docetaxel cycle treatment date (Day+5). The reason why majority of the patients had the reason 
‘Other’ was that there was no specific field in the eCRF to capture prophylactic use and the data was 
collected as free text.  
The majority of patients (85%) had not received prior surgical or radiation treatment. Around 25% of 
patients received concomitant treatment with bisphosphonates or denosumab. 
Primary endpoint 
The primary efficacy analysis in support of this application was performed at the data cut-off of 25-oct-
2021.   
With a total of 553 OS events: 229 deaths (35.2% of patients) in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT 
arm; 304 deaths (46.5% of patients) in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm, ARASENS study met its 
primary endpoint with a statistically significant improvement of OS in the darolutamide + docetaxel + 
ADT arm compared to placebo + docetaxel + ADT. The addition of darolutamide to backbone docetaxel 
+ ADT decreased the risk of death of 32.5% compared to the placebo arm (HR: 0.675; 95% CI: [0.568; 
0.801], p<0.0001) which is considered clinically relevant for the target population. Median OS was not 
reached  in  the  darolutamide  +  docetaxel  +  ADT  arm  (95%  CI:  [A;  A])  and  was  48.9  months  in  the 
placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm (95% CI: [44.4; A]). However, median OS in the control arm was lower 
than expected at the time of the estimation of the sample size and lower than the reported in studies 
STAMPEDE and CHAARTED (62 months and 57.6 months, respectively).  Further, in the study PEACE-
Assessment report  
EMA/80060/2023  
Page 94/147 
 
 
 
 
11, in de novo metastatic prostate cancer patients, median OS in the docetaxel plus ADT arm was of 
around 53 months. In this study, radiotherapy was allowed. The MAH provided supporting evidence to 
justify the difference observed of median OS between studies (CHAARTED, STAMPEDE and PEACE-1). 
The most likely cause of this observed difference, was the difference in clinical prognostic factors between 
the patients. Indeed, it is well known that Gleason score >8 as well as a diagnosis of de novo mHSPC or 
the presence of visceral metastases are factors of worse prognosis in prostate cancer.  
A high number of censored patients was reported in both arms, representing almost 60% of the FAS 
population, with 64.8% in the darolutamide arm and 53.5% in the placebo arm.  The provided description 
of the reasons for censoring, provided reassurance that the censorships were balanced between both 
arms throughout the study conduct. Likewise, a sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint imputing the 
use of prohibited medication as event was consistent with the primary analysis. 
Secondary endpoints 
The  start  of  a  new  systemic  antineoplastic  therapy  was  reported  for  33.6%  of  patients  in  the 
darolutamide  +  docetaxel  +  ADT  arm  compared  with  60.4%  in  the  placebo  +  docetaxel  +  ADT  arm. 
There  was  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically  meaningful  improvement  in  time  to  first  systemic 
therapy (TFST) associated with darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT vs the control arm (HR of 0.388, 95% 
CI: [0.328; 0.458]; p<0.0001).  
Given the stage of the disease, OS could be confounded by further treatment lines. The use of subsequent 
therapies known to have impact on patient´s survival was almost 1.33-fold higher in the placebo arm, 
which is  in  line with what can be expected  based  on  primary  results.  However,  the  magnitude of  the 
impact that subsequent therapies have in OS results cannot be complete elucidated. 
Time to castrate resistance was considered the most relevant secondary endpoint and  was defined 
as the time to PSA progression (i.e. ≥25% increase and an absolute increase ≥2 ng/ml from the nadir) 
with serum testosterone being at castrate level <0.50 ng/mL, or the time to radiological progression by 
soft  tissue/visceral  lesions  or  by  bone  lesions  whichever  occurs  first.  CRPC  was  documented  for  225 
(34.6%) patients in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and 391 (59.8%) patients in the placebo 
+ docetaxel + ADT arm. Of the patients who progressed to CRPC, the first progression event observed 
was mostly PSA progression for 121/225 patients (53.8%) in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm 
compared  with  289/391  patients  (73.9%)  in  the  placebo  +  docetaxel  +  ADT  arm.  A  statistically 
significant prolonged time to CRPC was observed for patients in the  darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT 
arm compared with the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm, with an HR of 0.357 (95% CI: [0.302; 0.421]); 
p<0.0001. The median time to CRPC was not reached (95% CI: [A; A]) in the darolutamide + docetaxel 
+ ADT arm and was 19.1 months (95% CI: [16.5; 21.8]) in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm. 
This delay in the time to CRPC was mainly based on PSA progression, which was in fact the main (first) 
event  observed  in  both  treatment  arms.  However,  no  apparent  differences  were  observed  between 
treatment arms in terms of radiological progression by bone or visceral lesions. As mentioned, rPFS was 
not included as secondary endpoint in the study, which would have provided information about the effect 
of darolutamide in delaying radiological disease progression.  
The assessment of PSA progression was questioned taking into account that only 53% of patients had 
testosterone castrate levels at baseline. At Visit 2 (Week 12) 93.7% of patients had castrate levels of 
testosterone. Considering at Visit 2 most patients were already on castrated levels it is presumed that 
no events of PSA progression had been reported for the vast majority of patients. Since testosterone at 
castrate levels was a necessary condition for a PSA progression event, the MAH clarified that patients

castration-sensitive prostate cancer (PEACE-1): a multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 study with a 2 × 2 factorial 
design. Lancet. 2022 Apr 30;399(10336):1695-1707. 
Assessment report

who did not have a testosterone castrate level did not qualify for a PSA progression event. Among the 
76  (6.3%)  remaining  patients  with  non-castrate  testosterone  level  at  Visit  2,  22  patients  fulfilled  the 
criteria for PSA progression at a subsequent and confirmation visit. There were 54 patients who did not 
fulfil the criteria and therefore were not evaluable for PSA progression but were assessed for radiological 
progression. Of these 54 patients 13 had radiological progression. Thus, in total, of the 76 patients, 35 
experienced an event. 
As  this  variation  proposes  the  use  of  darolutamide  as  an  add-on  to  one  of  the  standard  of  care,  the 
quality  of  life  of  patients  is  important  in  the  evaluation  of  the  claimed  indication.  Main  secondary 
endpoints which indirectly reflect the quality of life of patients were: Time to pain progression; SSE-FS; 
Time to first SSE; Time to initiation of subsequent systemic antineoplastic therapy; Time to worsening 
of  disease-related  physical  symptoms  based  on  functional  assessment  of  cancer  therapy;  Time  to 
initiation of opioid use for ≥7 consecutive days.  
The time to first symptomatic skeletal events in the study and the time to initiation of opioid use were 
considered clinically relevant in this context. 
A statistically significant delay in time to pain progression was observed in favour of the experimental 
arm (HR 0.792; 95% CI: [0.660, 0.950]), with 34.1% events in the darolutamide arm and 37.9% in the 
placebo arm. Median time to pain progression was not reached in the darolutamide arm and was of 27.5 
months in the placebo arm. Sensitivity analyses were consistent. Approximately 71.5% of patients in 
the  study  were  taking  concomitant  analgesics.  SSEs  were  reported  in  14.6%  of  patients  in  the 
darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm compared with 16.5% in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm with 
a numerical improvement (i.e. a delay) of time to first SSE for patients in the darolutamide + docetaxel 
+ ADT arm, with an HR of 0.712 (95% CI: [0.539; 0.940]); p=0.0081. The median time to first SSE 
was not reached (95% CI: [A; A]) in either treatment arm. The majority of the first SSEs were External 
beam radiation therapy to relieve skeletal symptoms, reported for 63.2% of patients with an SSE in the 
darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and 82.4% of patients with an SSE in the placebo + docetaxel + 
arm.  
Worsening of disease-related physical symptoms was observed for 53.9% of patients in the darolutamide 
+ docetaxel + ADT arm and 47.1% of patients in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm. There was no 
significant  difference  in  time  to  worsening  of  disease-related  physical  symptoms  between  the 
treatment  arms  (HR=1.043;  95%  CI:  [0.894,  1.217];  p=0.7073).  The  median  time  to  worsening  of 
disease-related  physical  symptoms  was  19.3  months  (95%  CI:  [13.8,  24.8])  in  the  darolutamide  + 
docetaxel + ADT arm and 19.4 months (95% CI: [15.4, 27.6]) in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm. 
Since time to worsening of disease-related physical symptoms was not statistically significant, the results 
of  the secondary endpoint  time to initiation of opioid use  were considered  exploratory.  It is  to be 
noted that 14.1% of patients in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and 17.9% in the placebo + 
docetaxel + ADT arm had initiated opioid treatment for cancer pain for ≥7 consecutive days. The time 
to  first  opioid  use  for  ≥7  consecutive  days  showed  an  advantage  in  favour  of  the  darolutamide  + 
docetaxel + ADT arm, with an HR of 0.688 (95% CI: [0.523; 0.906]); p=0.0037. 
Findings  from  secondary  efficacy  analyses  all  showed  statistically  significant  results  in  favour  of 
darolutamide  +  docetaxel  +  ADT  arm  except  for  the  Time  to  worsening  of  disease-related  physical 
symptoms based on the NCCN–FACT-FPSI-17 questionnaire. 
Exploratory endpoints 
Additional  exploratory  endpoints  also  favoured  darolutamide  +  docetaxel  +  ADT  arm  compared  to 
placebo + docetaxel. 
Assessment report  
EMA/80060/2023  
Page 96/147 
 
 
 
 
Baseline  PSA  values  were  comparable  between  the  treatment  arms  (median  30.30  ng/mL  in  the 
darolutamide  +  docetaxel  +  ADT  arm  and  24.20  ng/mL  in  the  placebo  +  docetaxel  +  ADT  arm). 
Treatment with darolutamide in combination with docetaxel resulted in a longer time to PSA progression 
than placebo in combination with docetaxel, with an HR of 0.255 (95% CI: [0.208; 0.313]); p<0.0001.  
The majority of the patients in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm (88.6%) and in the placebo + 
docetaxel + ADT arm (68.7%) had a maximum PSA decline of ≥90% from baseline at any time on study 
treatment. 
Patients in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm showed a significantly higher relative PSA response 
rate of ≥90% reduction from baseline at 12 months after randomization than patients in the placebo + 
docetaxel  +  ADT  arm,  84.3%  vs.  57.5%,  respectively  (difference=26.82%,  95%  CI:  [22.11;  31.53], 
p<0.0001). Both absolute PSA response rates (PSA level <0.2 ng/mL) and relative PSA response rates 
(≥90% reduction in PSA from baseline) were higher in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm than in 
the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm at all evaluated time points. 
Concerning quality of life (QoL), the results indicated that health-related QoL was maintained while on 
treatment in patients in both treatment arms. At baseline (i.e., Screening or Visit 1/Day 1), the BPI-SF 
pain interference and pain severity scores were similar between the treatment arms. Changes in mean 
values from baseline for the pain severity and pain interference scores were observed in both treatment 
arms, and there were no clinically meaningful differences (MID=2 points) between the treatment arms. 
Subgroups analysis  
The different subgroup analyses according to tumour volume (high and low tumour volume) showed a 
favourable benefit in overall survival and other efficacy outcomes (time to castration-resistant prostate 
cancer, symptomatic skeletal event-free survival, time to initiation of subsequent systemic antineoplastic 
therapy) with no major differences were observed regarding burden of disease. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Despite  therapeutic  advances  in  recent  years  in  the  treatment  of  prostate  cancer,  the  arsenal  of 
treatment in mHSPC setting remains limited.  
ARASENS  study  met  its  primary  endpoint  with  a  statistically  significant  improvement  of  OS  in  the 
darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm compared to placebo + docetaxel. ARASENS study demonstrated 
a reduction of the risk of death of 32.5% in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm compared to the 
placebo  +  docetaxel  +  ADT  arm  (HR:  0.675;  95%  CI:  [0.568;  0.801]),  and  the  log-rank  test  was 
statistically significant with a one-sided p<0.0001.  
Findings  from  secondary  efficacy  analyses  all  showed  statistically  significant  results  in  favour  of 
darolutamide  +  docetaxel  +  ADT  arm  except  for  the  Time  to  worsening  of  disease-related  physical 
symptoms based on the NCCN–FACT-FPSI-17 questionnaire. The combination darolutamide + docetaxel, 
in the ARASENS study, significantly reduced the onset of castration-resistant disease, prolonged the time 
to the first SSE, and the time to subsequent systemic antineoplastic therapy.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The evidence for the clinical safety of darolutamide in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of 
mHSPC is based on the data from the pivotal Study 17777 (ARASENS) in patients with mHSPC 
Assessment report  
EMA/80060/2023  
Page 97/147 
 
 
 
 
(n=1302) from start of the study (30 NOV 2016) until the database cut-off date for the primary 
completion analysis (25 OCT 2021). 
Safety data were also derived from the following sources: 
• 
Integrated analysis of safety from completed uncontrolled Phase 1/2 darolutamide studies in 
patients with mCRPC (mCRPC pool) comprising Study 17829 (ARADES) [including extension 
Study 18035 (ARADES-EXT)], Study 17830 (ARAFOR), and Study 17719 (n=173). 
• 
Integrated analysis of safety from completed Phase 1 single dose darolutamide studies in non-
cancer subjects (non-cancer subject pool) comprising Studies 17721, 17726, 17831, and 
18426. No new multiple dose darolutamide studies were conducted since the submission of the 
initial dossier, therefore, “non-cancer subject pool” refers to the updated integrated analysis of 
the single dose studies in this SCS (n=80). 
In addition, the summaries of deaths and serious adverse events (SAEs) and treatment-emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) leading to treatment discontinuation were provided from the ongoing Phase 3 
Study 21140 (ARANOTE) in mHSPC patients, and for the ongoing roll-over Study 20321. 
Analysis sets 
All safety evaluations are presented for the safety analysis set (SAF), defined as: 
• 
Phase 3 Study 17777 (ARASENS): all randomized patients who received at least one dose of 
study drug (darolutamide or placebo), except for cases with critical GCP violations. Patients 
were included in the analyses according to the treatment they actually received. Patients were 
included in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm if they had received any dose of 
darolutamide. 
• 
Integrated safety analyses in mCRPC patients (mCRPC pool) and in non-cancer subjects (non-
cancer subject pool): all patients and subjects, respectively, who received at least one dose of 
study treatment.

•  Patient exposure 
Darolutamide exposure 
A summary of study drug exposure in Study 17777 until the database cut-off date for the primary 
completion analysis (25 OCT 2021) is presented in the table below. 
Table 51 Study drug exposure in Study 17777 (SAF) 
After the last dose of docetaxel, patients continued on study drug treatment for a median time of 36.9 
months in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm (n=642) and 13.1 months in the placebo + 
docetaxel + ADT arm (n=637).

Two cases of darolutamide overdose were reported, both with an actual total daily dose of 2400 mg for 
1 day only. Following the overdose, no TEAEs were reported for either patient. 
Docetaxel exposure 
In Study 17777, docetaxel was administered at a dose of 75 mg/m2 as an IV infusion every 21 days 
for 6 cycles, starting within 6 weeks after the start of study drug. A summary of docetaxel exposure in 
Study 17777 until the database cut-off date for the primary completion analysis is presented in the 
table below. 
Table 52 Docetaxel exposure in Study 17777 (SAF) 
Most patients in both treatment arms received at least 1 dose of docetaxel within 6 weeks after the 
first dose of darolutamide or placebo. There were 10 patients (1.5%) in the darolutamide + docetaxel 
+ ADT arm and 13 patients (2.0%) in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm who never received 
docetaxel. These patients were initially assessed by the investigator to be candidates for ADT and 
docetaxel. After randomization and start of study drug, they were no longer considered to be eligible to 
receive concomitant docetaxel within 6 weeks after start of study drug.

Table 58 Incidences and exposure-adjusted incidence rates of the most common TEAEs by 
MedDRA PT occurring in ≥10% of patients in either treatment arm in Study 17777 (SAF) 
TEAEs over time 
The incidence (new or worsening TEAEs) and prevalence of the most commonly reported TEAEs were 
analyzed within pre-specified time intervals (3-month intervals for the first year and 6-month intervals 
from thereafter up to 24 months) in Study 17777.  
Incidences of commonly reported TEAEs, including alopecia, fatigue, anaemia, arthralgia, oedema 
peripheral, neutrophil count decreased, diarrhoea, WBC count decreased, neuropathy peripheral, and 
peripheral sensory neuropathy, were highest during the first 3 months of treatment and started to 
decrease during Months 4 to 6 after the start of study treatment in both treatment arms. A further

decrease was seen during Months 7 to 12, after completing the docetaxel treatment (data not shown) 
The incidences of these events then remained stable during continued treatment with study drug.  
Prevalence followed a similar general trend for most of the TEAEs listed above; however, the 
prevalence of TEAEs decreased over a longer period of time. The prevalence of neuropathy peripheral 
and peripheral sensory neuropathy remained stable throughout the whole study in both treatment 
arms. A trend of increasing prevalence of arthralgia, hypertension, and hyperglycaemia was observed 
in both treatment arms.

o  Hypertension 
Approximately half of the patients in both the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and the placebo + 
docetaxel + ADT arm (51.3% vs. 49.2%, respectively) had a medical history of hypertension (single 
PT) in the FAS. 
Medical history of blood pressure increased was reported for 0.5% vs. 0.2% of patients, and essential 
hypertension for 1.4% of patients in both the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT and placebo + 
docetaxel + ADT arms, respectively. 
Pre-treatment AEs of hypertension (single PT) were reported with a slightly higher incidence in the 
darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm than in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm (2.5% vs 1.7%, 
respectively). 
Treatment-emergent events of hypertension (data-driven grouping) were more commonly reported in 
the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm than in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm 13.8% vs. 9.4%, 
respectively). When adjusted for the difference in study drug treatment duration, the EAIRs of 
hypertension were similar between the arms (5.2 vs. 5.1 per 100 PY), with an incidence risk ratio of 
1.02. The events within this group were mainly driven by a single PT hypertension (13.0% vs 9.1%). 
Although the incidence of Grade 1 and 2 hypertension events (data-driven grouping) were similar 
between the treatment arms, hypertension events with Grade 3 as the worst grade were more 
commonly reported in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm (6.4%) than in the placebo + 
docetaxel + ADT arm (3.5%). There was 1 patient with a Grade 4 event of hypertension in both the 
darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm (hypertensive emergency) and the placebo + docetaxel + ADT 
arm (hypertensive crisis).  
One patient in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT treatment arm was reported with two Grade 5 
events (hypertension and arteriosclerosis). As per the patient’s death certificate, the patient died due 
to hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The investigator and sponsor did not 
suspect a causal relationship to darolutamide. There were no Grade 5 events in the placebo + 
docetaxel + ADT arm. 
Overall, TEAEs of hypertension were reported more commonly in patients with no medical history of 
hypertension in both treatment arms, and the incidences were higher in the darolutamide + docetaxel 
+ ADT arm than in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm (16.4% vs. 10.3% of patients, respectively). 
Among the patients with medical history of hypertension, the incidence of TEAEs of hypertension with 
worst grade of 3 was higher in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm than in the placebo + 
docetaxel + ADT arm (7.2% vs. 3.9%, respectively). The incidence of hypertension with worst grade of 
3 was also higher in patients without history of hypertension in the darolutamide +docetaxel arm 
compared with the placebo+docetaxel + ADT arm (5.6% vs 3.1%).

o  Rash 
Treatment-emergent events of rash were reported with a higher incidence in the darolutamide + 
docetaxel + ADT arm compared with the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm (16.6% vs. 13.5%, 
respectively). When adjusted for the difference in study drug treatment duration, the EAIRs of rash 
were similar between the arms (6.2 vs. 7.3 per 100 PY), with an incidence risk ratio of 0.85. At the PT 
level, the most commonly reported TEAE within this group was an unspecific term rash in both 
treatment arms (7.8% vs. 6.9%). 
Events of rash were reported with a worst grade of 1 or 2 in severity in most patients. Events with a 
worst grade of 3 were reported with a slightly higher incidence in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT 
arm than in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm (1.2% vs. 0.2%), respectively. At the PT level, the 
difference was mainly driven by Grade 3 rash maculo-papular (0.6% vs. 0%), followed by Grade 3 
drug eruption (0.3% vs. 0%) and Grade 3 rash (0.3% vs. 0.2%). Grade 4 rash (PT drug eruption) was 
reported in 1 patient (0.2%) in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm whereas no Grade 4 events 
of rash were observed in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm. 
The events of rash were considered serious in 1 patient (0.2%) in both treatment arms. Study drug 
and docetaxel were permanently discontinued due to rash in 1.1% and 0.9% of patients in the 
darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm, respectively, with no permanent discontinuations being reported 
in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm. Study drug dose was interrupted in 1.4% vs. 0.2% of patients 
and reduced in 0.5% vs. 0% of patients in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and the placebo + 
docetaxel + ADT arm, respectively. Docetaxel dose was interrupted in 0.6% vs. 0.5% of patients and 
reduced in 1.1% vs. 0.5% of patients in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and the placebo + 
docetaxel + ADT arm, respectively. 
o  Cardiac disorders 
The overall incidence (12.7% vs. 13.8%) of TEAEs within the SOC cardiac disorders was similar in the 
darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm, respectively. The 
events were mostly reported with Grade 1 or 2 as the worst grade in both treatment arms. Grade 5 
events within the SOC cardiac disorders included 5 patients (0.8%) in the darolutamide + docetaxel + 
ADT arm and 3 patients (0.5%) in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm. The events were mostly 
reported with Grade 1 or 2 as the worst grade in both treatment arms. Grade 5 events within the SOC 
cardiac disorders included 5 patients (0.8%) in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and 3 
patients (0.5%) in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/80060/2023  
Page 110/147 
 
 
 
 
 
Altogether, 112 patients in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and 128 patients in the placebo + 
docetaxel + ADT arm had a medical history of cardiac disorders before the start of study treatment. In 
both treatment arms, the incidence of TEAEs within the SOC cardiac disorders was higher in patients 
who had a history of cardiac disorders, and this difference was more evident in patients in the placebo 
+ docetaxel + ADT arm: 
-  Darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm 
o History of cardiac disorders: 20/112 patients (17.9%) 
o No history of cardiac disorders: 63/540 patients (11.7%) 
- 
Placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm 
o History of cardiac disorders: 37/128 patients (28.9%) 
o No history of cardiac disorders: 53/522 patients (10.2%) 
TEAEs within the HLGT (High Level Group Term) cardiac arrhythmias were reported with a similar 
incidence (8.0% vs. 8.5%) in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and the placebo + docetaxel + 
ADT arm, respectively. The most common PTs within this HLGT were sinus tachycardia (1.5% in both 
arms), tachycardia (1.4% vs. 1.5%), atrial fibrillation (1.4% vs. 1.2%) and sinus bradycardia (1.1% 
and 0.6%) in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm, 
respectively. 
TEAEs within the HLGT coronary artery disorders were reported with a small difference between the 
darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm (2.9% vs. 2.0%, 
respectively). When adjusted for the difference in study drug treatment duration, the EAIR was 1.1 per 
100 PY in both treatment arms. The most common PTs within this HLGT were myocardial infarction 
(0.9% vs. 0.3%), acute myocardial infarction (0.5% vs. 0.5%), and angina pectoris (0.5% vs. 0.3%) 
in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm, respectively. Two 
fatal events of myocardial infarction were reported in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm. 
TEAEs within the HLGT heart failures were reported in 0.6% vs. 2.0% of patients in the darolutamide + 
docetaxel + ADT arm and the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm, respectively. Of note, the most 
commonly reported TEAEs within this HLGT were less frequent in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT 
arm than in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm, respectively: cardiac failure (0.2% vs. 1.4%) and left 
ventricular failure (0% vs. 0.6%). 
o  Diabetes mellitus and hyperglycaemia 
TEAEs of diabetes mellitus and hyperglycaemia were reported with a similar incidence between the 
darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm (15.2% vs. 14.3%, 
respectively). At the PT level, the most commonly reported TEAE within this group was hyperglycaemia 
in both treatment arms (11.3% vs. 9.4%). Events of diabetes mellitus and hyperglycaemia were 
reported with a worst grade of 3 in 3.5% vs. 4.5% of patients, and with a worst grade of 4 in 0.2% vs. 
0.9% of patients in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm, 
respectively. An analysis of diabetes mellitus and hyperglycaemia over time showed that both the 
incidence and prevalence of Grade 3 or 4 events were highest during the first 3 months of treatment 
and decreased thereafter in both treatment arms, whereas there was a consistent increase in the 
prevalence of Grade 1 or 2 events over time in both treatment arms. 
The events of diabetes mellitus were considered serious in 0.5% vs. 1.1% of patients in the 
darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm, respectively. No study

drug or docetaxel discontinuations, dose interruptions or dose reductions were reported in the 
darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm. 
o  Fatigue/asthenic conditions 
TEAEs of special topics were most commonly reported within the grouped term of fatigue/asthenic 
conditions in both the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm 
(48.3% vs. 49.1%, respectively). At the PT level, the most commonly reported TEAE within this group 
was fatigue, which was also reported with a similar incidence in both treatment arms (33.1% vs. 
32.9%). An analysis of fatigue/asthenic conditions events over time showed that the events were 
predominantly reported during the first months from the start of study treatment in both treatment 
arms. The events of fatigue/asthenic conditions were considered serious in 0.5% vs. 0.3% of patients 
in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm, respectively. The 
events resulted in study drug dose interruption in 0.8% vs. 0.2% of patients in the darolutamide + 
docetaxel + ADT arm and the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm, respectively, and in dose reduction in 
0.6% of patients in both treatment arms. 
o  Bone fractures (excluding pathological fractures) 
TEAEs of bone fracture were reported with a small difference between the darolutamide + docetaxel + 
ADT arm and the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm (7.5% vs. 5.1%, respectively). When adjusted for 
the difference in study drug treatment duration, the EAIRs of bone fractures were similar between the 
treatment arms (2.8 vs. 2.7 per 100 PY), with an incidence risk ratio of 1.03. Of note, there were 
1.1% of patients in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and 0.5% of patients in the placebo + 
docetaxel + ADT arm who had pathological fracture (not part of the grouped term). 
Bone fractures were reported with a worst grade of 1 or 2 in severity in most patients. Events with a 
worst grade of 3 were reported in 1.5% of patients in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and in 
2.3% in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm. The bone fracture events were considered serious in 
1.4% vs. 1.5% of patients in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and the placebo + docetaxel + 
ADT arm, respectively. Study drug was permanently discontinued due to bone fracture in 0.3% of 
patients in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm with no respective events reported in the darolutamide 
+ docetaxel + ADT arm. 
o  Fall 
Treatment-emergent events of fall were reported with a small difference between the darolutamide + 
docetaxel + ADT arm and the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm (6.6% vs. 4.6%, respectively). When 
adjusted for the difference in study drug treatment duration, the EAIRs of fall were 2.5 per 100 PY in 
both treatment arms, with an incidence risk ratio of 1.00. Almost all events within this group were due 
to a PT fall. The events of fall were reported with a worst grade of 1 or 2 in severity in most patients 
and thus were minor with no resultant injuries or were symptomatic with noninvasive intervention 
needed. The fall events were considered serious in 0.3% of patients in the darolutamide + docetaxel + 
ADT arm and no serious events were reported in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm. 
o  Vasodilatation and flushing 
Treatment-emergent events of vasodilatation and flushing were reported with a similar incidence in the 
darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm (20.4% vs. 21.7%, 
respectively). 
o  Breast disorders/gynaecomastia 
TEAEs of breast disorders/gynaecomastia were more commonly reported in the darolutamide + 
docetaxel + ADT arm than in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm (3.2% vs. 1.5%, respectively). When 
Assessment report  
EMA/80060/2023  
Page 112/147 
 
 
 
 
adjusted for the difference in study drug treatment duration, the EAIRs of breast 
disorders/gynaecomastia were 1.2 vs. 0.8 per 100 PY, with an incidence risk ratio of 1.46. 
All events of breast disorders/gynaecomastia were either Grade 1 or 2 as the worst grade in both 
treatment arms. No TESAEs, study drug or docetaxel discontinuations, dose interruptions or dose 
reductions were reported due to breast disorders/gynaecomastia in the darolutamide + docetaxel + 
ADT arm. 
o  Mental impairment disorders 
TEAEs of mental impairment disorders were reported with a small difference between the darolutamide 
+ docetaxel + ADT arm and the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm (3.5% vs. 2.3%, respectively). When 
adjusted for the difference in study drug treatment duration, the EAIRs of mental impairment disorders 
were similar between the arms (1.3 vs. 1.2 per 100 PY), with an incidence risk ratio of 1.06. Grade 1 
or 2 was the worst grade for all reported events. At the PT level, the most commonly reported TEAE 
within this group was memory impairment (1.2% vs. 0.9%), followed by cognitive disorder (0.9% vs. 
0.5%) and disturbance in attention (0.8% vs. 0.5%) in both the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm 
and the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm, respectively.  
o  Depressed mood disorders 
TEAEs of depressed mood disorders were reported with a similar incidence in the darolutamide + 
docetaxel + ADT arm and in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm (3.2% vs. 3.7%, respectively). 
o  Cerebrovascular disorders 
TEAEs of cerebral ischemia were reported in 1.2% of patients in both treatment arms. Cerebral and 
intracranial hemorrhage were reported in 6 patients (0.9%) in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT 
arm and in 1 patient (0.2%) in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm. Confounding factors, such as 
preceding surgery, fall or underlying comorbidities (hypertension, aneurysma, thrombocytopenia), 
were identified for all 6 patients who had cerebral or intracranial hemorrhage in the darolutamide + 
docetaxel + ADT arm. None of the events were considered drug-related by the investigator. 
o  Seizure 
During the study, seizure was reported in 4 patients (0.6%) in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT 
arm and in 1 patient (0.2%) in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm (Table 2–17). At the PT level, the 
events were seizure (3 patients) and focal dyscognitive seizures (1 patient) in the darolutamide + 
docetaxel + ADT arm, and epilepsy (1 patient) in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm. 
All seizure events were of Grade 1 (0.2% vs. 0%) or Grade 2 (0.5% vs. 0.2%) in the darolutamide + 
docetaxel + ADT arm and the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm, respectively. No study drug permanent 
discontinuations were reported due to seizure. 
The 4 patients with a reported seizure in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm had no medical 
history of seizure. Two of these patients had confounding factors: CVA and movement disorders as 
medical history in one patient, and CVA as a co-reported event in another patient. 
The third patient in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm had a history of anxiety and experienced 
focal dyscognitive seizures (reported term: complex partial epileptic crisis) 341 days after starting 
darolutamide treatment. Darolutamide dose was not changed as a result of this event. 
The event was treated with valproic acid and levetiracetam. The fourth patient had a seizure between 
docetaxel cycles 1 and 2. The brain CT and electroencephalogram were without findings. Darolutamide 
dose was not changed, whereas docetaxel treatment was interrupted due to the event. 
Assessment report  
EMA/80060/2023  
Page 113/147 
 
 
 
 
Overall, 2 of the 4 seizure events in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm occurred during the 
docetaxel treatment. The seizure event led to docetaxel interruption in 1 of the patients but 
darolutamide dose was not changed in either of these 2 patients. 
o  Weight decreased 
TEAEs of weight decreased (single PT) were reported with a slightly lower incidence in the 
darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm than in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm (3.4% vs. 5.4%, 
respectively). 
TEAEs commonly associated with docetaxel 
The most common TEAEs in Study 17777 largely overlapped with the TEAEs commonly associated with 
docetaxel (alopecia, anaemia, neutrophil count decreased and neutropenia, diarrhoea, constipation, 
nausea, neuropathy peripheral and peripheral sensory neuropathy, myalgia, dysgeusia, asthenia, and 
dyspnoea). 
-  Neutrophil count decreased was one of the most commonly reported TEAEs occurring in 26.1% 
of patients in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and in 23.8% of patients in the placebo 
+ docetaxel + ADT arm. Neutropenia was reported in 10.4% and 11.7% of patients in the 
darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm, respectively. 
Most of the patients with neutrophil count decreased or neutropenia had an event with a worst 
grade of 3 or 4 in both treatment arms (these were the most common Grade 4 TEAEs). 
Neutrophil count decreased was assessed as study drug-related by the investigator in 1.4% vs. 
0.6% of patients, and docetaxel-related in 24.8% vs. 22.8% of patients in the darolutamide + 
docetaxel + ADT and the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm, respectively. Neutropenia was 
assessed as study drug-related in 0.6% vs. 0.3% of patients, and docetaxel-related in 9.2% 
vs. 10.6% of patients in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT and the placebo + docetaxel + 
ADT arm. 
-  AST and ALT increased were reported as TEAEs with slightly higher incidences in the 
darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm (14.0% and 15.6% of patients, respectively) than in the 
placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm (10.5% and 12.9% of patients, respectively). AST increased 
and ALT increased were among the most commonly reported study drug-related TEAEs, TEAEs 
leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug or docetaxel, and TEAEs leading to study 
drug or docetaxel dose modifications. 
Additional primary malignancies 
In Study 17777, additional primary malignancies were reported in 25 patients (3.8%) in the 
darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and in 16 patients (2.5%) in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT 
arm. 
Additional primary malignancies reported in ≥2 patients in either the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT 
arm or the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm, respectively, are summarized below. 
-  Basal cell carcinoma: 3 patients (0.5%) vs. 1 patient (0.2%) 
-  Squamous cell carcinoma of skin: 2 patients (0.3%) vs. 2 patients (0.3%) 
- 
Pancreatic carcinoma: 2 patients (0.3%) vs. 0 patients (0%) 
-  Squamous cell carcinoma: 2 patients (0.3%) vs. 0 patients (0%)

There was 1 patient in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm reported with a suspicion of laryngeal 
cancer that was never confirmed. For this patient, a laryngoscopy was performed, but there was no 
confirmation of cancer (data from the clinical database). 
In 8 patients in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and in 2 patients in the placebo + docetaxel 
+ ADT arm subsequent systemic antineoplastic therapy was given for additional primary malignancies 
•  mCRPC pool 
At least one TEAE was experienced by 94.2% of patients in the mCRPC pool. 
TEAEs were of Grade 1 or Grade 2 as the worst grade in severity in the majority of the patients 
(64.2%). Grade 5 TEAEs were reported in 4.0% of patients. 
TESAEs were reported in 28.3% of patients and TEAEs led to permanent discontinuation of the study 
drug in 7.5% of patients. 
Similar to Study 17777, TEAEs of special topics were most commonly reported within the grouped term 
of fatigue/asthenic conditions in the mCRPC pool (32.4%). At the PT level, fatigue was also the most 
commonly reported TEAE in the mCRPC pool (26.0%) 
Table 63 Incidences of TEAEs of special topics in mCRPC pool (SAF) 
Adverse drug reactions 
For identification of ADRs of darolutamide in mHSPC indication, the clinical data from the Phase 3 
Study 17777 (ARASENS) were analyzed. 
The analysis of TEAEs and laboratory abnormalities for the identification of ADR was as follows: 
-  Selection of the TEAE preferred or grouped terms by evidence of disproportionality between 
the treatment arms: Selection of the TEAE preferred or grouped terms by evidence of 
disproportionality between the treatment arms (≥ 2%), 
-  Analysis of selected TEAE terms to identify further potential evidence: 
compatibility/consistency with the pharmacological properties of darolutamide such as mode of 
action, known pharmacological class effect, analysis of TEAEs over time, analysis of absolute 
and exposure-adjusted incidence rate,  
Assessment report  
EMA/80060/2023

-  Assessment of relevance of the prioritized TEAE term/medical concept based on the frequency 
of ADR, proportion of SAEs, proportion of Grade ≥3 TEAEs, proportion of events leading to 
permanent discontinuation of study treatment or dose adjustment, analysis of baseline patient 
characteristics. 
In addition to the analysis of TEAE terms, hematological and biochemical laboratory-based 
abnormalities were also reviewed, focusing on a higher incidence (≥5% difference) in the darolutamide 
+ docetaxel + ADT arm compared to the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm, central tendency (mean and 
median values), abnormal values distribution (categorized by severity grade) including shift-from-
baseline analysis and laboratory-based abnormalities occurring with a difference in incidence between 
treatment arms of less than 5% were reviewed for clinical significance and considered in the context of 
the totality of safety data. (SmPC section 4.8)

A total of 229 patients (35.1%) in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and 304 patients (46.8%) 
in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm had died as of the database cut-off date. The most common 
cause of death was progressive disease in both the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm (26.1% of 
patients) and placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm (36.0% of patients). 
The majority of deaths in the study occurred more than 30 days after the last dose of study drug in 
both the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm (30.5% of patients) and the placebo + docetaxel + ADT 
arm (42.6% of patients). 
No patients died before the treatment start. One patient in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm 
died during the treatment period due to an AE not associated with disease progression (acute cardiac 
failure reported on the same day when study drug was stopped).  
A death within 30 days after the last dose of study drug was reported in 4.4% vs. 4.2% of patients in 
the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm, respectively, mostly 
due to AEs not associated with disease progression (2.9% vs. 1.5%) or progressive disease (0.8% vs. 
0.6%). 
The incidences of all TEAEs with fatal outcome (Grade 5) are displayed in the table below.

Table 67 Incidence of TESAEs (any grade) by MedDRA PT occurring in ≥1% of patients in 
either treatment arm in Study 17777 (SAF) 
In the ongoing Study 21140 in mHSPC patients receiving darolutamide or placebo in addition to ADT 
(based on non-validated clinical database), SAE was reported during treatment or within 30 days after 
study treatment discontinuation as of the database cut-off date for the submission (25 OCT 2021).  
In the ongoing roll-over Study 20321 in patients receiving treatment with darolutamide in addition to 
ADT (based on non-validated clinical database), at least one SAE was reported in 38 patients during 
treatment or within 30 days after study treatment discontinuation as of the database cut-off date for 
the submission (25 OCT 2021). SAEs were most frequently reported in SOCs infections and infestations 
(14 events), renal and urinary disorders (8 events) and cardiac disorders (6 events). 
Laboratory findings 
•  Hematological and biochemical laboratory abnormalities 
Laboratory abnormalities at baseline were reported with a worst grade of 1 or 2 for most patients in 
both treatment arms. There were only a few laboratory abnormalities with a worst grade of 4: ALP 
increased in 1.7% of patients in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm vs. 2.9% of patients in the 
placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm, lymphocyte count decreased (0.8% vs. 0.2%), neutrophil count 
decreased (0.8% vs. 0%), hyperglycaemia (0.4% vs. 0%), and hyperkalaemia (0% vs. 0.2%). 
Overall, pre-treatment laboratory abnormalities were reported at similar incidences in both treatment 
arms. 
The incidences of hematological and biochemical laboratory abnormalities in Study 17777 after the 
start of treatment are presented by CTCAE term and worst CTCAE grade in the table below.

Laboratory abnormalities that were reported with ≥5 percentage points higher incidence in the 
darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm than in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm included blood 
bilirubin increased (19.6% vs. 10.0% of patients, respectively), neutrophil count decreased 
(50.6% vs. 45.5%), and hyperkalaemia (26.0% vs. 20.5%).  
Analysis of liver function tests 
o  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
In Study 17777 at baseline, the median value was 24.00 U/L in both treatment arms. Before the start 
of study treatment, increased ALT (any grade) was reported as a laboratory abnormality in 11.4% of 
patients in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and in 11.2% of patients in the placebo + 
docetaxel + ADT arm. No patients had pre-treatment abnormalities of Grade >2. 
ALT increased was reported as a laboratory abnormality with a slightly higher incidence in the 
darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm than in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm, i.e. 42.3% vs 
38.0%. Most of the events were reported with a worst grade of 1 in both treatment arms (34.2% and 
31.5% in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm respectively). 
Treatment-emergent laboratory abnormality of ALT increased with a worst grade of 3 was observed in 
22 patients (3.4%) in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm vs. 16 patients (2.5%) in the placebo 
+ docetaxel + ADT arm, and with a worst grade of 4 in 2 patients (0.3%) vs. 3 patients (0.5%), 
respectively. 
ALT increased of any grade was reported as a TEAE in 15.6% of patients in the darolutamide + 
docetaxel + ADT arm and in 12.9% of patients in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm. TEAEs of Grade 
3/4 ALT increased occurred in 18 patients (2.8%) in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm 
compared with 11 patients (1.7%) in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm. 
o  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
In Study 17777 at baseline, the median value was 24.00 U/L in both treatment arms. Before the start 
of study treatment, increased AST (any grade) was reported as a laboratory abnormality in 7.7% of 
patients in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and in 8.6% of patients in the placebo + 
docetaxel + ADT arm. No patients had pre-treatment abnormalities of Grade >2. 
AST increased was reported as a laboratory abnormality with a slightly higher incidence in the 
darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm than in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm, i.e. 43.9% vs 
39.3%. Most of the events were reported with a worst grade of 1 in both treatment arms (36.8% and 
33.7% in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm respectively). 
Treatment-emergent laboratory abnormality of AST increased with a1 worst grade of 3 was observed 
in 22 patients (3.4%) in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm vs. 13 patients (2.0%) in the 
placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm, and with a worst grade of 4 in 1 patient (0.2%) vs. 2 patients 
(0.3%), respectively. 
AST increased of any grade was reported as a TEAE in 14.0% of patients in the darolutamide + 
docetaxel + ADT arm and in 10.5% of patients in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm. TEAEs of Grade 
3/4 AST increased occurred in 17 patients (2.6%) in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm 
compared with 7 patients (1.1%) in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm 
o  Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 
ALP increased was reported as a laboratory abnormality with comparable incidences in both treatment 
arms (62.7% and 63.5% in darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and in the placebo + docetaxel + 
ADT arm, respectively). Most of the events were reported with a worst grade of 1 or 2 in both

treatment arms. Blood ALP increased was reported as a TEAE in 6.9% of patients in the darolutamide 
+ docetaxel + ADT arm and in 6.6% of patients in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm. 
o  Blood bilirubin 
Before the start of study treatment, laboratory abnormality of blood bilirubin increased was observed 
at a similar incidence in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm (1.5%) and the placebo + docetaxel 
+ ADT arm (1.1%).  
Blood bilirubin increased was observed with a higher incidence in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT 
arm than in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm. Most of the events were reported with a worst grade 
of 1 or 2 in both treatment arms, i.e. all grade 19.6% vs. 10.0% in the darolutamide + docetaxel + 
ADT arm and the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm, respectively; Grade 1: 15.0% vs. 8.0% and Grade 
2: 4.2% vs. 1.7%. Overall, increases in worst grade from pre-treatment were observed at a higher 
incidence in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm than in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm. 
The difference in bilirubin between the treatment arms over time increased after the 6 months of 
docetaxel combination treatment period. 
Blood bilirubin increased (part of SOC of investigations) was reported as a TEAE in 4.9% of patients in 
the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and in 2.9% of patients in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT 
arm. Almost all patients with TEAE blood bilirubin increased had events with a worst grade of 1 or 2, 
and there was 1 patient (0.2%) in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm with an event with a worst 
grade of 3 (no patients in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm). Hyperbilirubinemia (part of SOC of 
hepatobiliary disorders) was reported as a TEAE in 2 patients (0.3%) in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT 
arm (1 patient had an event with a worst grade of 1 and 1 patient with a worst grade of 3) (no 
patients in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm). 
Hy’s Law and drug-induced liver injury (DILI) 
Potential Hy’s Law cases 
Possible Hy’s Law cases were defined as patients with treatment-emergent abnormalities of liver 
function tests falling in the Hy’s Law range (patients with elevated AST and/or ALT >3xULN, and 
bilirubin ≥2xULN) with ALP <2xULN.  Two cases in darolutamide+docetaxel arm and two cases in the 
placebo+docetaxel arm. One case in the darolutamide+docetaxel arm experienced hepatocellular 
injury meeting Hy’s Law criteria 37 days after commencing darolutamide treatment and 13 days after 
the first and only dose of docetaxel. Marked increases in ALT and AST occurred with evidence of 
hepatic functional impairment as indicated by concurrent elevated bilirubin and INR. Skin rash and 
pyrexia were also documented.  
Increase in transaminases 
The incidence was 17.6% and 14.9%, respectively, in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and 
the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm. Worst Grade 3 TEAEs occurred in 3.4% of patients in the 
darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm vs. 1.8% of patients in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm. 
TEAEs of increase in transaminases (MLG) with a worst grade of 4 occurred in 1 patient (0.2%) in the 
darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and 2 patients (0.3%) in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm. 
This patient had reversible and clinically asymptomatic increases in ALT and AST of >20xULN with 
concurrent normal bilirubin levels Docetaxel had been discontinued almost 5 months prior to the 
events. Dechallenge and rechallenge with darolutamide was positive.  
Drug-induced liver injury (DILI), PT (part of SOC of hepatobiliary disorders): TEAEs occurred in 3 
patients (0.5%) in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and 4 patients (0.6%) in the placebo + 
docetaxel + ADT arm. In the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm, 2 cases were Grade 2 and one 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/865923/2022

case was Grade 4. In the place+docetaxel arm, one case was Grade 1, 2 cases were Grade 2 and one 
case was Grade 3.  
Of the 7 patients, 3 patients in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm had non-serious TEAEs of DILI, all 
with isolated transaminase elevations and no meaningful increase in total bilirubin level. 
The remaining 4 patients experienced TESAEs of DILI (3 patients in the darolutamide + docetaxel + 
ADT arm and 1 patient in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm). One of the patients in the darolutamide 
+ docetaxel + ADT arm who had a DILI TESAE with a worst grade of 4 is discussed above as one of 
the potential Hy’s Law cases.  
12-lead ECG and QTc 
At Screening, the 12-lead ECG was performed for 633/652 (97.1%) and 607/650 (93.4%) patients in 
the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT and placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm, respectively, of which 
43.4% and 41.7% of patients had central ECG reading interpreted as abnormal (of which 1.5% and 
1.4%, respectively, were considered clinically significant by the investigator). The analysis of the ECG 
data by visit did not reveal any relevant imbalance between the treatment arms or changes from 
baseline. 
A summary of QTcF values at baseline, at EOT, and at last visit is presented in the table below. 
Table 69 Summary of QTcF values in Study 17777 (SAF) 
Among the 7 patients with a post baseline QTcF value >500 msec at the EOT visit in the darolutamide 
+ docetaxel + ADT arm, most of them had this value only at the EOT visit and not in prior visits. 
TEAE electrocardiogram QT prolonged was reported in 5 patients (0.8%) in the darolutamide + 
docetaxel + ADT arm and in 7 patients (1.1%) in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm. All these were 
reported as non-serious and the study drug doses were not modified due to the events in any of the 
patients. 
Fridericia QTc results were in general similar between treatments arms, and within a treatment arm, at 
baseline, end of treatment, and last visit. Baseline ECG abnormalities were observed at a similar 
incidence in patients in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and the placebo + docetaxel + ADT 
arm. An analysis of ECG data over time did not reveal any relevant imbalance between the treatment 
arms.

Concomitant statin use 
Concomitant use of statins with darolutamide can increase the exposure to statins, with rosuvastatin 
increasing up to 5-fold (Zurth et al. 2019). Therefore, a subgroup analysis was performed to 
investigate whether the AE profile differs between users and non-users of statins. This analysis 
included all TEAEs that were reported in concomitant statin users compared with non-users regardless 
of the time when the event occurred (ie, not considering if the event occurred during concomitant 
darolutamide and statin administration). An overview of TEAEs by concomitant statin use in Study 
17777 is presented below.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
• 
TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation 
Overall, TEAEs that resulted in permanent discontinuation of study drug occurred at a higher 
incidence in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm than the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm 
(13.5% vs. 10.6%, respectively). The most common TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of 
study drug (in ≥5 patients in either treatment arm) were AST increased (0.9% vs. 0.3%), ALT 
increased (0.8% vs. 0.2%) and bone pain (0.3% vs. 1.4%). 
The incidences of TEAEs that resulted in permanent discontinuation of docetaxel were slightly lower 
in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm compared to the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm (8.0% 
vs. 10.3%, respectively). The most common TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of docetaxel 
(in ≥5 patients in either treatment arm) were neutrophil count decreased (0.8% vs. 0.5%), febrile 
neutropenia (0.5% vs. 0.8%), neutropenia (0.5% vs. 0.8%), and WBC count decreased (0.2% vs. 
0.9%).

• 
TEAEs leading to dose interruption 
TEAEs that resulted in interruption of study drug occurred at a higher incidence in the darolutamide 
+ docetaxel + ADT arm (22.9%) than in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT+ ADT arm (15.7%). The most 
common TEAEs leading to interruption of study drug (in ≥2% of patients in either treatment arm) were 
ALT increased (3.2% vs. 1.5%), AST increased (3.1% vs. 1.1%), and febrile neutropenia (2.1% vs. 
1.4%) in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm, 
respectively. When adjusted for the difference in study drug treatment duration, the incidences of all 
TEAEs were comparable between the treatment arms, except for ALT increased (EAIRs of 1.2 vs. 0.8 
per 100 PYs in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT and placebo + docetaxel + ADT arms, 
respectively), and AST increased (EAIRs of 1.2 vs. 0.6 per 100 PYs, respectively). 
TEAEs that resulted in interruption of docetaxel occurred at a similar incidence between the 
treatment arms, in 21.9% of patients in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and 20.6% of 
patients in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm. The most common TEAEs leading to interruption of 
docetaxel (in ≥2% of patients in either treatment arm) were ALT increased (4.0% vs. 3.4%), 
neutrophil count decreased (2.8% vs. 2.3%), and AST increased (2.8% vs. 1.7%) in the darolutamide 
+ docetaxel + ADT arm and placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm, respectively.

arm) were ALT increased (2.8% vs. 1.2%) and AST increased (2.5% vs. 0.8%) in the darolutamide + 
docetaxel + ADT arm and placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm, respectively. All other TEAEs were reported 
in ≤4 patients each. When adjusted for the difference in treatment duration, the incidences of all 
TEAEs were comparable between the treatment arms, except for AST increased, for which the EAIRs 
were 0.9 vs. 0.4 per 100 PYs in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT and placebo + docetaxel + ADT 
arms, respectively. 
TEAEs that resulted in dose reduction of docetaxel occurred at a similar incidence between the 
treatment arms, in 19.9% of patients in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and 19.5% of 
patients in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm. The most common TEAEs leading to reduction of 
docetaxel (in ≥2% of patients in either treatment arm) were neutrophil count decreased (5.4% vs. 
6.0%), febrile neutropenia (3.7% vs. 3.8%), WBC count decreased (3.2% vs. 3.4%), and neutropenia 
(1.8% vs. 2.2%) in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm, 
respectively. The incidences of these TEAEs were comparable between the treatment arms.

Post marketing experience 
No new safety concerns were identified from darolutamide post-marketing surveillance between the 
first marketing authorization (30 JUL 2019) and the cut-off date for the latest Periodic Benefit-Risk 
Evaluation Report (PBRER) (30 JUL 2021). 
From 30 JUL 2019 until 30 JUL 2021, the distributed volume of darolutamide (NUBEQA) 300 mg film-
coated tablets was 6700440 tablets, and the estimated patient exposure to the marketed product 
worldwide was 4590 patient years. 
The estimated patient exposure to the marketed product worldwide was 4,590 patient years. A total of 
966 events were reported cumulatively from post-marketing data sources. Of these 966 events, 790

events (81.8%) were derived from spontaneous reports, including regulatory authority and literature. 
Of these 790 events, 161 events were serious (20.4%) and 629 events were non-serious (79.6%). The 
remaining 176 events (18.2%) were derived from non-interventional post-marketing studies and other 
solicited sources. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of darolutamide in combination with docetaxel in the intended indication mHSPC was 
mainly based on data from the pivotal study 17777 (DCO date: 25 Oct 2021) including 652 patients 
with mHSPC treated with darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT and standard ADT and 650 patients with 
mHSPC treated with placebo+ docetaxel and standard ADT. Supportive safety data were provided by 
the mCRPC pool including Phase 1/2 darolutamide studies in patients with mCRPC (n=173) and the 
non-cancer subject pool including Phase 1 single dose darolutamide studies (n=80).  
In Study 17777, docetaxel was administered at a dose of 75 mg/m2 as an IV infusion every 21 days 
for 6 cycles, starting within 6 weeks after the start of study drug, ADT (LHRH agonist/ antagonist 
concurrently or bilateral orchiectomy) was started ≤12 weeks before randomization and continued 
throughout the study and darolutamide and its matching placebo were administered at a dose of 600 
mg BID.  
Extent of exposure 
The median treatment duration was longer in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm than the 
placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm, i.e. 41.0 months and 16.7 months, respectively. Difference between 
the 2 arms might be partly explained by the percentage of discontinuation of study treatment due to 
disease progression, i.e. 54.1% of treatment discontinuation in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT 
arm vs 80.4% in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm of the FAS. The average daily dose of study drug 
was comparable across the two treatments arms. The median percent of study drug planned dose was 
100% and the mean was above 97% in both treatment arms, reflecting a good treatment compliance. 
The exposure to docetaxel was well balanced among the 2 treatment arms with 87.6% of subjects in 
the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and 85.5% in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm who 
received 6 cycles of docetaxel treatment. The average docetaxel cycle dose received was similar across 
the two treatment arms. 
At the DCO there were 424 patients (32.5%) still on treatment, 299 (45.9%) receiving darolutamide 
and 125 (19.1%) receiving placebo. There were 105 (16.1%) patients in the darolutamide arm and 38 
(5.8%) in the placebo arm that received treatment for >48 months. 
The fact that patients remained significantly longer time in the darolutamide arm reflects that the 
tolerability of darolutamide was acceptable, unmanageable side effects did not occur frequently and 
these patients had not progressed.  
Importantly, the addition of darolutamide did not translate into a lower number of docetaxel cycles 
administered: 87.6% of patients in the darolutamide arm received 6 cycles of docetaxel, in comparison 
with 85.5% patients in the placebo arm. In the context of a combination therapy with chemotherapy, 
this observation is reassuring. The number of dose modifications for the study drug was higher in the 
darolutamide arm than in the placebo arm (670 vs. 463), as expected. However, the proportion of 
patients with dose modifications was overall comparable between treatment arms. The percentage of 
events with TEAE as primary reason for study drug dose modification was 37.0% for darolutamide and 
32.0% for placebo. No differences were observed between treatment arms in dose modification of 
docetaxel due to TEAEs (46.5% and 43.2%). There were more patients with ≥ 10 dose modifications 
per patient in the darolutamide arm than in the placebo arm (7.9% vs. 4.4%).

Overall, the patient exposure is considered to be sufficient to characterize the safety profile of 
darolutamide in combination with docetaxel in the proposed indication.      
Adverse events 
The overview of TEAEs is comparable across the treatment arms. Almost all the patients experienced a 
TEAE, i.e. 99.5% in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and 98.9% in the placebo + docetaxel + 
ADT arm. Slightly more TEAEs leading to study drug dose modification were reported in darolutamide 
+ docetaxel + ADT arm than placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm, i.e. 25.9% vs 17.2%, while the TEAEs 
leading to docetaxel dose modification were similar across the treatment arms, i.e. 32.8% and 32.9%.  
The majority of the TEAEs reported were severe with 70.2% of Grade ≥3 TEAEs in darolutamide + 
docetaxel + ADT arm and 67.5% in placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm, with a greater rate of docetaxel-
related Grade ≥3 TEAEs (42.6% in both arms) compared to study drug-related Grade ≥3 TEAEs (9.5% 
in darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and 6.3% in placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm). 
The most commonly reported TEAEs were generally similar between the treatment arms. The most 
common events (≥25% of patients in either treatment arm) included alopecia, fatigue, anaemia, 
arthralgia, oedema peripheral, neutrophil count decreased, and diarrhoea. Those observed TEAEs were 
consistent with the known safety profile of docetaxel and darolutamide. 
The most common TEAEs reported with ≥3 percentage points higher incidence in the darolutamide + 
docetaxel + ADT arm than in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm were decreased appetite (18.6% vs 
13.1%), hypertension (13.0% vs 9.1%), AST increased (14.0% vs 10.5%), and pain in extremity 
(15.0% vs 12.0%). When adjusted for the difference in study drug treatment duration, the EAIRs of 
these events were comparable between the treatment arms. 
Overall, events with a worst grade of 3, 4, or 5 were reported with low incidences within the most 
common TEAEs, with the exception of the following Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs that occurred in ≥5% of 
patients in either treatment arm: neutrophil count decreased, febrile neutropenia, white blood count 
(WBC) count decreased, hypertension, anaemia and neutropenia. 
Overall, these most common TEAEs occurred with similar incidences between the treatment arms, 
except for hypertension and ALT and AST increased, that occurred more frequently in darolutamide + 
docetaxel + ADT arm than placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm. 
Concerning TEAEs over time, the incidence of commonly reported TEAEs, including alopecia, fatigue, 
anaemia, arthralgia, oedema peripheral, neutrophil count decreased, diarrhoea, WBC count decreased, 
neuropathy peripheral, and peripheral sensory neuropathy, were similar between the treatment arms. 
Prevalence followed a similar general decreasing trend for most of the TEAEs listed above. The trend of 
increasing prevalence of arthralgia, hypertension, and hyperglycaemia, observed in both treatment 
arms, could be explained due to the underlying comorbidities of the elderly patient population along 
with metastatic disease. 
Adverse events of special topics  
Among the TEAEs of special topic identified as potential or known risks associated with ADT or with 
anti-androgens, comparable incidence across the two treatment arms were observed except for the 
following events (by grouped TEAE term) reported at a higher rate in darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT 
arm than placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm: rash (16.6% vs 13.5%), diabetes (15.2% vs 14.3%), 
hypertension (13.8% vs 9.4%), bone fractures (7.5% vs 5.1%), fall (6.6% vs 4.6%), breast disorders 
(3.2% vs 1.5%) and mental impairment disorders (3.5% vs 2.3%). It is noted that the incidence of 
the TEAEs of special interest was greater in the study 17777 compared to the ARAMIS study that 
supported the approval of darolutamide in nmCRPC.

Since patients in the darolutamide arm remained significantly longer time on treatment than patients 
in the placebo arm, the incidences of AEs could be impacted by this difference. For this reason, the 
incidences adjusted by time and over time were provided. The results suggested that most AEs 
occurred within the first 6 months of treatment, and that afterwards the incidences decreased notably. 
It should be noted that “hypertension” did not seem to follow this pattern since it was less clear that 
incidences decreased over time. AEs prevalence also decreased over time with a similar trend among 
PTs. 
Hypertension was newly identified as an ADR, with the grouped term hypertension (data-driven: PTs 
hypertension, blood pressure increased, hypertensive crisis, hypertensive emergency) reported at a 
higher incidence in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm than in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT 
arm (51.3% vs 49.2%). Hypertension was reported in 13.8% of patients treated with 
darolutamide+docetaxel and 9.4% of patients treated with placebo+docetaxel.Grade 3 hypertension 
was reported in 6.4% of patients treated with darolutamide+docetaxel compared to 3.5% of patients 
treated with placebo+docetaxel. One patient had grade 4 hypertension in each treatment arm. One 
case was reported as grade 5 hypertension with grade 5 arteriosclerosis in the darolutamide+docetaxel 
arm. This patient had a long standing history of hypertension and smoking and the case occurred more 
than 3 years after starting darolutamide treatment. Events of hypertension were reported more 
commonly in patients with no medical history of hypertension in both treatment arms. 
The section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated to include relevant information about cases of 
hypertension reported in mHSPC.   
Overall, no major differences were observed between treatment arms regarding AEOSIs, but there was 
a higher incidence of breast disorders/gynaecomastia, which was double in the darolutamide arm 
compared with the placebo arm (3.2% vs 1.5%). All these events were of Grade 1/2. After adjusting 
for treatment exposure, the exposure-adjusted incidence rate (EAIR) remained higher in the 
darolutamide arm (1.2 vs 0.8). In Study 17712 (ARAMIS) the profile of events of breast 
disorders/gynaecomastia was similar: 2.3% vs. 1.6%, further suggesting that there might be an 
increased risk of occurrence of these events with darolutamide, which has been somehow replicated in 
Study 17777 (ARASENS). Considering the replication of results in two different studies, the double 
frequency reported between arms in Study 17777 (ARASENS), and the fact that gynaecomastia is a 
known ADR for another second-generation androgen receptor inhibitor (i.e. enzalutamide), it is 
considered that there is a reasonable likelihood of a potential causal link that justifies the inclusion of 
this AE in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Therefore, “gynaecomastia” has been included in section 4.8, with 
frequency “common”.  
Six (0.9%) patients in the darolutamide and only 1 (0.2%) in the placebo arm reported an event of 
cerebral and intracranial haemorrhage. After adjusting for treatment exposure differences appeared 
lower, but still higher in the darolutamide arm (0.3 vs 0.1 per 100 PY, respectively). A pooled analysis 
from ARASENS and ARAMIS studies including 1606 patients in the darolutamide arm and 1204 in the 
placebo arm showed cerebral and intracranial haemorrhage events of any-grade in 8 patients (0.5%) 
in the darolutamide arm vs. 3 patients (0.2%) in the placebo arm, being the RR 2.11 (95% CI: 0.61; 
7.36). Although the evidence so far available does not clearly indicate a causal role for darolutamide, 
the fact that these events are of high-grade severity and that potentially they can lead to death or 
cause long-term damage is worrisome. Therefore, the MAH will continue to closely monitor these 
events in the PSURs.     
Additional primary malignancies were reported in 25 patients (3.8%) in the darolutamide arm vs. 
16 patients (2.5%) in the placebo arm. Besides, more SAEs and deaths due to secondary malignancies 
were reported in the darolutamide arm than in the placebo arm. Although the difference between arms 
observed in Study 17777 (ARASENS) is small, a carcinogenicity risk has been associated with other 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/865923/2022 
Page 132/147 
 
 
 
drugs from the same pharmacological class, and the non-clinical studies performed with darolutamide 
could not rule out this carcinogenicity risk. Therefore, based on the evidence so far available, the 
causal relationship with darolutamide could not be excluded and further monitoring should be 
warranted. As such, “carcinogenicity potential” has been reclassified from “missing information” to 
“important potential risk” in the RMP.  
An increased incidence for new symptomatic pathological fractures (6.6% vs 2.4%) and spinal cord 
compression (5.4% vs 2.7%) was observed in the SSE-FS and Time to SSE tables. It is recognized that 
the cumulative incidence might have been affected by the different median time on treatment between 
arms. In study 17777, there was a higher rate of TEAEs of bone fractures including pathological 
fractures in darolutamide+docetaxel arm than placebo+docetaxel arm (8.3% vs 5.5%, respectively) 
but when adjusted for the difference in study drug treatment duration, the EAIRs of bone fractures 
were similar between the treatment arms (2.8 vs. 2.7 per 100 PY). Nevertheless bone fracture is a 
known ADR of darolutamide (see SmPC section 4.8), there was an imbalance of TEAEs of bone 
fractures across the treatment arms and the effect of additional androgen depletion additive to ADT is 
likely to have increased negative effects on bone mineral density over time and likely increased the 
risk for fracture with longer duration of darolutamide+docetaxel+ADT above placebo+docetaxel+ADT. 
Therefore, bone fracture has been added to the list of ADRs reported in combination with docetaxel in 
the mHSPC patients in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Adverse drug reactions 
The list of ADRs as reflected in the SmPC was elaborated based on the identification of a causal 
relationship between a TEAE and darolutamide.  As a result, ALT increased, hypertension and 
gynaecomastia were identified as new ADRs of darolutamide. 
Less ADRs were identified for the combination of darolutamide+docetaxel in mHSPC compared to 
darolutamide alone for the treatment of nmCRPC while the safety profile is more unfavourable in 
mHSPC than in nmCRPC. Since darolutamide was administered in combination with docetaxel, adverse 
reactions from both darolutamide and docetaxel can be confounded and prevent the identification of a 
clear association between TEAE and one of the active substances.  
Serious adverse events / deaths 
In terms of death´s causes, overall there is no evidence of any trend, suggesting that the causes of 
death were similar in nature between arms. The only cause of death by PT reported with a higher 
incidence in the darolutamide arm than in the placebo arm was “COVID-19 pneumonia”: 0.6% vs. 
0.2%; although an additional death coded as “COVID-19” was also reported in the darolutamide arm. 
The clinical relevance of this observation is uncertain taking into account that the rate of infections was 
not higher in the darolutamide arm in comparison with the placebo arm, and considering the small 
number of events.   
Special attention should be given to deaths related to cardiac and vascular disorders: in the 
darolutamide arm there were 7 deaths during treatment and within 30 days post permanent treatment 
discontinuation caused by cardiac and vascular disorders (PTs: “arteriosclerosis”+”hypertension”; 
“anaesthetic complication cardiac”; “cardiac failure acute”; “myocardial infarction”; “cardiac disorder”; 
“acute myocardial infarction”; “cardiac arrest”), and 2 additional deaths caused by “haemorrhagic 
stroke” and “subarachnoid haemorrhage”. Of note, only 3 deaths related to cardiac and vascular 
disorders were reported in the placebo arm (2 due to “cardiac arrest” and 1 due to “cardiac failure”), 
together with an additional death caused by “cerebrovascular accident”. Although none of the deaths 
of the darolutamide arm was considered as related by the investigator because patients had several 
underlying confounding factors. Further, in the darolutamide arm of study ARASENS there were 2 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/865923/2022 
Page 133/147 
 
 
 
 
deaths due to a secondary malignancy in contrast to no reported deaths in the placebo arm. The 2 
deaths were considered a second primary malignancy (urothelial cell carcinoma and gastric cancer, 
respectively) and unrelated to darolutamide. Subjects died 3 and 2 years after receiving the first dose 
of darolutamide, respectively. 
SAE rates, although considerably high (probably impacted by the concomitant administration of 
docetaxel), were similar between treatment arms, i.e. 44.8% vs 42.3%, respectively. Febrile 
neutropenia was the most common SAE and was reported in 6.1% vs. 6.0% of patients in the 
darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm, respectively. Neutrophil 
count decreased was the only SAE that occurred in ≥1% of patients at a higher incidence in 
darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm compared to placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm (2.8% vs 1.5%). 
Overall, no SOC was particularly higher in the darolutamide arm in comparison with the placebo arm, 
except for “neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps)”, which was 
reported in 4.1% in the darolutamide arm vs. 2.3% in the placebo arm and considered study drug 
related in 0.2% in darolutamide group (one case of myelofibrosis) and 0 in placebo group.  
Laboratory findings 
The most commonly reported (≥50% of patients in either arm) laboratory abnormalities (any grade) 
were anaemia, hyperglycaemia, ALP increased, lymphocyte count decreased, WBC decreased, and 
neutrophil count decreased. Hematotoxicity is characterized with the use of docetaxel and anaemia 
and neutropenia are known risk associated with docetaxel. The incidence of anaemia, lymphocyte 
count decreased and WBC decreased was similar across the two treatment arms.  Laboratory 
abnormalities that were reported with ≥5 percentage points higher incidence in the darolutamide + 
docetaxel + ADT arm than in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm included blood bilirubin increased 
(19.6% vs. 10.0% of patients, respectively), neutrophil count decreased (50.6% vs. 45.5%), and 
hyperkalaemia (26.0% vs. 20.5%). 
“Neutrophil count decreased” was reported with a high incidence in both arms, but the incidence of G1-
4 events and the incidence of G4 events were similar between arms: 50.6% vs. 45.5% and 22.1% vs. 
19.4% respectively. Neutrophil count decreased is a known ADR of darolutamide and docetaxel. 
Therefore, it has been included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
“AST/ALT increased” were reported with a high incidence, but the incidence of G1-4 events was quite 
similar between arms (around 40%). Furthermore the incidence of G4 events was low in both arms. 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC includes ALT/AST increased as ADRs. 
With regards to blood bilirubin, it can be concluded that there is a causal role of darolutamide in 
combination with docetaxel in triggering the laboratory abnormality of blood bilirubin increased. These 
results are in line with the exposure-response analysis which showed that the change in total blood 
bilirubin over time in mHSPC patients was statistically different in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT 
than in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm. Therefore it has been included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Hepatotoxicity 
Overall, the elevations of ALT, AST and blood bilirubin were more reported in patients treated with 
darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT than those treated with placebo+docetaxel, and liver functions 
increased were mostly of low grade of severity. 
Cases of DILI were reported in Study 17777 and their occurrence was balanced across the 2 arms. 
However more serious cases were observed with darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT compared to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/865923/2022 
Page 134/147 
 
 
 
 
placebo+docetaxel. There were 2 possible Hy’s Law cases in darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and 
one case in placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm, and both cases were reversible.  
In addition, the MAH provided in the document on signal evaluation for Drug-Induced Liver Injury 
(DILI) across all darolutamide clinical trials and 5 cases were considered to provide strong evidence for 
a causal association between darolutamide and idiosyncratic hepatocellular liver injury and both 5 were 
serious cases: 2 cases from ARASENS (Study 17777), 2 from ARAMIS (Study 17712), and 1 case that 
met Hy’s Law from an investigator sponsored research study (ODENZA). 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated to reflect the cases of hepatic transaminase elevations 
suggestive of a DILI related to darolutamide.  In addition, a warning has been added in section 4.4 to 
reflect that in case of hepatic transaminase elevations suggestive of idiosyncratic drug-induced liver 
injury related to darolutamide, the treatment should be permanently discontinued. 
Vital signs 
Overall, no meaningful differences in the changes of mean or median values for blood pressure 
measurements, body weight, body mass index (BMI), and heart rate were observed across the two 
treatment arms. 
Safety in special population 
In both arms, the incidence of Grade 4-5 TEAEs, SAEs and TEAEs leading to docetaxel dose 
modification and permanent discontinuation increased with increasing age. While comparing the two 
treatment arms, the overview of TEAEs was comparable in the age groups <65 and 75-84 except for 
TEAEs leading to study drug dose modification and permanent discontinuation of study drug for these 
2 age groups. An imbalance was however observed in the age group 65-74 that included the majority 
of the subjects in study 17777 (n=303 in darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and n=305 in placebo 
+ docetaxel + ADT arm) with a higher proportion of Grade 3-4 TEAEs, SAE and TEAEs leading to study 
drug dose modification and permanent discontinuation of study drug in darolutamide + docetaxel + 
ADT arm compared to the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm. 
In both treatment arms, the number of patients with moderately impaired renal function at baseline 
was smaller than the number of patients with mildly impaired or normal renal function. Comparable 
overview of TEAEs by renal function was observed across the treatment arms except TEAEs leading to 
study drug modification in mild RI that were more reported in darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm 
than placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm (30.5% vs 20.5%). 
There were 2 patients in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm with moderately impaired hepatic 
function, and the number of patients with mildly impaired hepatic function was small in both treatment 
arms; therefore, comparisons across hepatic function groups should be made with caution. Overall, the 
incidences of any TEAEs, TESAEs, and TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation or dose 
modification were generally similar between the hepatic function groups in both treatment arms. 
Regarding subgroups by geographical region, it should be noted that Asian patients had an increased 
rate of TESAEs and grade 4 events in both arms in comparison with patients from other regions. 
Notably, an increase in the TEAEs leading to docetaxel dose modification and docetaxel permanent 
discontinuation was observed in both arms, suggesting that the worse toxicity profile observed in this 
subgroup of patients was driven by the docetaxel administration and not by the darolutamide 
administration. Specifically, by PT this increase seemed to be associated with an increase rate of 
“neutrophil count decreased”, “white blood cell count decreased” and “anaemia”. The incidence of 
these TEAES was higher in the first 6 months, and afterwards it decreased over time. Apart from this 
apparent link between a worse tolerability in Asian patients and the administration of docetaxel, it 
should be noted that patients in the Asian Pacific region presented at study entry with a more 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/865923/2022 
Page 135/147 
 
 
 
advanced disease stage, which could also play a role in the worse tolerability observed in this subgroup 
of patients. Other PTs were also significantly increased in Asian patients, such as “malaise”, which was 
reported in 21.3% and 24.0% in the darolutamide and placebo arm, respectively; whereas in the other 
subgroups it was reported with an incidence lower than 5% in either arm. The clinical relevance of this 
observation remains unknown, although it does not seem to have an important impact on the safety 
profile of darolutamide. 
The MAH also presented subgroups analysis by concomitant statin use. Overall, no clinically meaningful 
differences were observed among subgroups, although the incidence of TESAEs and TEAEs leading to 
study drug or docetaxel dose modification were higher in the subgroup of patients taking statins 
concomitantly. However, this observation should be interpreted with caution due to the smaller size of 
the subgroup of patients taking statins (N=183) than the subgroup of patients not taking statins 
(N=480). The incidence of pre-defined TEAEs reflecting frequent undesirable effects of statins 
(ALT/AST/transaminases increased, muscular weakness, renal failure/impairment, etc) were also 
assessed in those subsets and the results did not show any significant imbalance which could be 
explained by drug-drug interactions between darolutamide and statins. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Overall TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug were more reported in darolutamide 
+ docetaxel + ADT arm than placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm (13.5% vs 10.6%, respectively) while 
those leading to permanent docetaxel discontinuation occurred more frequently in the placebo + 
docetaxel + ADT arm than the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm (10.3% vs 8.0%, respectively).  
All TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug and docetaxel occurred at low rate <1% except bone 
pain in placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm. The most common TEAEs leading to permanent 
discontinuation of study drug (in ≥5 patients in either treatment arm) were AST increased (0.9% vs. 
0.3%), ALT increased (0.8% vs. 0.2%) and bone pain (0.3% vs. 1.4%).  
Regarding the incidence of TEAEs leading to interruption of the study drug, it should be highlighted 
that the incidence was markedly higher in the darolutamide arm (22.9%) vs. the placebo arm 
(15.7%), mainly due to Grade 3 TEAEs. The higher rate of interruptions seems to be driven mainly by 
the imbalance in some PTs, such as “ALT and AST increased”, as well as “febrile neutropenia”; which 
were reported with approximately double frequency in the darolutamide compared with the placebo 
arm. TEAEs leading to interruption of docetaxel were reported with a similar incidence in both arms. 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to dose reduction of the study drug was overall low, although in the 
darolutamide arm it was twice as high as the incidence in the placebo arm (8.7% vs 4.3%), also 
apparently driven mainly by “ALT and AST increased” PTs. The incidence of TEAEs leading to docetaxel 
dose reduction was similar between arms, suggesting that darolutamide addition did not have a 
detrimental effect on the planned administration of docetaxel. 
Post marketing experience 
No new safety concerns were identified from darolutamide post-marketing surveillance. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT in mHSPC was comparable to 
placebo+docetaxel but worsened compared to the known safety profile of darolutamide in nmCRPC 
with a toxicity mainly driven by the combination with docetaxel. The majority of the reported adverse 
events were severe (Grade ≥3) in both treatment arms, with 70.2% of Grade ≥3 TEAEs in 
darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and 67.5% in placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm. The incidence of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/865923/2022 
Page 136/147 
 
 
 
 
serious adverse events was comparable across the treatment arms but greater in study 17777 
(ARASENS) than in ARAMIS study in mCRPC patients for both treatment groups. Hypertension, ALT 
increased and gynaecomastia were newly identified as ADRs of darolutamide. Hepatotoxicity arised 
from the safety data of clinical trials in which 5 cases were considered to provide strong evidence for a 
causal association between darolutamide and idiosyncratic hepatocellular liver injury. In both cases the 
hepatotoxicity events were manageable. Concerning the carcinogenicity risk, which has been 
previously associated with other drugs from the same pharmacological class, based on the available 
evidence presented so far, the causal relationship with darolutamide could not be excluded. Therefore, 
“carcinogenicity potential” has been reclassified from “missing information” to “important potential 
risk” in the RMP and additional pharmacovigilance activities have been proposed to further assess this 
risk.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
This application was to extend the indication of Nubeqa (darolutamide) to include the treatment of 
adult men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) in combination with docetaxel.  
The recommended indication is: NUBEQA is indicated for the treatment of adult men with metastatic 
hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) in combination with docetaxel and androgen deprivation 
therapy.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Metastatic HSPC, also known as metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC), is defined as 
metastatic prostate cancer in patients who have not yet received or are continuing to respond to anti-
hormonal  therapy.  Depriving  prostate  cancer  cells  of  androgen  is  the  primary  form  of  therapy  since 
prostate cancer depends on androgen for growth and survival. ADT is defined as surgical castration by 
bilateral orchiectomy or medical castration with LHRH agonist/antagonists.  
Although almost all men with mHSPC initially respond to ADT, most will progress to mCRPC within 1 to 
3 years of their initial diagnosis.  
According to ESMO guideline on cancer of the prostate (2020), the recommended treatment of hormone 
naïve setting is ADT (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [LHRH] agonist or surgical castration) in 
combination with one of the following approved treatments of mHSPC: abiraterone, a CYP17 inhibitor 
(with  prednisone  or  prednisolone),  an  ARI  (apalutamide  or  enzalutamide),  docetaxel  with  or  without 
prednisone or prednisolone.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The  pivotal  study  for  this  application  is  trial  ARASENS  (study  17777):  a  Phase  III,  multinational, 
randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating darolutamide 600 mg BID orally in 
combination  with  6  cycles  of  docetaxel.  Patients  were  randomised  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  receive  either 
darolutamide or placebo, each combined with docetaxel and ADT. 
The primary endpoint was OS. The secondary endpoints were the time to castration-resistant prostate 
cancer  (CRPC),  the  time  to  pain  progression,  symptomatic  skeletal  event-free  survival  (SSE-FS),  the 
time  to  first  symptomatic  skeletal  event  (SSE),  the  time  to  initiation  of  subsequent  systemic 
antineoplastic therapy, the time to worsening of disease-related physical symptoms, the time to initiation 
of opioid use for ≥7 consecutive days. 
3.1.4.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint of the pivotal study was met, with a statistically significant improvement of OS in 
the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm compared to placebo + docetaxel. ARASENS study showed a 
reduction of the risk of death of 32.5% in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm compared to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/865923/2022

placebo  +  docetaxel  +  ADT  arm  (HR:  0.675;  95%  CI:  [0.568;  0.801]),  and  the  log-rank  test  was 
statistically significant with a one-sided p<0.0001.  
The  start  of  a  new  systemic  antineoplastic  therapy  was  reported  for  33.6%  of  patients  in  the 
darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm compared with 60.4% in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm which 
represents a  statistically  significant and  clinically  meaningful  improvement  with an  HR  of 0.388,  95% 
(CI: [0.328; 0.458]; p<0.0001.  
CRPC was documented for 225 (34.6%) patients in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and 391 
(59.8%)  patients  in  the  placebo  +  docetaxel  +  ADT  arm.  A  statistically  significant  prolonged  time  to 
CRPC was observed for patients in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm compared with the placebo 
+ docetaxel + ADT arm, with an HR of 0.357 (95% CI: [0.302; 0.421]); p<0.0001.  
SSEs were reported in 14.6% of patients in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm compared with 
16.5% in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm with a numerical improvement (ie, a delay) of time to first 
SSE for patients in the  darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm, with an HR of 0.712 (95% CI: [0.539; 
0.940]); p=0.0081. The median time to first SSE was not reached (95% CI: [A; A]) in either treatment 
arm. The majority of the first SSEs were External beam radiation therapy to relieve skeletal symptoms, 
reported for 63.2% of patients with an SSE in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and 82.4% of 
patients with an SSE in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm.  
Findings  from  secondary  efficacy  analyses  all  showed  statistically  significant  results  in  favour  of 
darolutamide  +  docetaxel  +  ADT  arm  except  for  the  Time  to  worsening  of  disease-related  physical 
symptoms based on the NCCN–FACT-FPSI-17 questionnaire.  
3.2.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
A relatively large proportion of patients had premature emergency unblinding performed at the study 
site by the investigator to inform the choice of subsequent therapy. The premature unblinding was limited 
to the investigator and patient, and study team members remained blinded to treatment allocation until 
the formal study unblinding at the time of analyses. The impact and potential bias induced by premature 
unblinding on subsequent patient measurements were discussed and post-hoc analyses were provided 
for the endpoints that were considered to be most likely influenced by premature unblinding: time to 
pain progression and time to worsening of physical disease-related symptoms. Although bias cannot be 
completely ruled out in the presence of premature unblinding, the additional information and post-hoc 
analyses performed by the MAH provided some reassurance that the study conclusions were not affected.  
3.3.  Unfavourable effects 
The majority of the patients in study 17777 experienced a TEAE, and the TEAEs observed were mostly 
severe (Grade ≥3) in both treatment arms. The incidence of TEAEs, Grade 1-2 TEAEs and Grade 3-4 
TEAEs was comparable between the  darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT and the placebo + docetaxel + 
ADT arms in study 177777. The majority of the TEAEs reported were severe with 70.2% of Grade ≥3 
TEAEs in darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and 67.5% in placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm. The most 
common  events  (≥25%  of  patients  in  either  treatment  arm)  included  alopecia,  fatigue,  anaemia, 
arthralgia,  oedema  peripheral,  neutrophil  count  decreased  and  diarrhoea.  The  most  common  TEAEs 
reported with ≥3 percentage points higher incidence in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm than 
in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm were decreased appetite, hypertension, AST increased and pain 
in extremity. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/865923/2022 
Page 142/147 
 
 
 
The SAEs were reported at comparable rates in darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT and placebo + docetaxel 
+ ADT arms, i.e. 44.8% vs 42.3%, respectively. Febrile neutropenia was the most common SAE across 
the  two  treatment  arms  and  neutrophil  count  decreased  was  the  only  SAE  that  occurred  in  ≥1%  of 
patients at a higher incidence in darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm compared to placebo + docetaxel 
+ ADT arm (2.8% vs 1.5%). The Grade 5 TEAEs were reported at similar rate across the treatment arms 
(4.1% and 4.0% in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm and the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm, 
respectively). 
Hypertension and ALT increased were newly identified as ADRs 
The grouped term hypertension (data-driven: PTs hypertension, blood pressure increased, hypertensive 
crisis, hypertensive emergency) was reported at a higher incidence in the darolutamide + docetaxel + 
ADT arm than in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm (51.3% vs 49.2%). Also Grade 3 hypertension was 
higher in darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm than in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm (6.4% vs 
3.5%  of  patients,  respectively).  One  case  of  Grade  5  Atherosclerotic  Cardiovascular  Disease  and 
Hypertensive was reported in darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT arm.  
ALT increased was reported with a slightly higher incidence in the darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT 
arm than in the placebo + docetaxel + ADT arm. In addition, an increased frequency of AST elevations 
and blood bilirubin increased, already identified as adverse drug reactions of darolutamide in nmCRPC 
patients, were observed in patients treated with darolutamide in combination with docetaxel in 
comparison with patients who received placebo in combination with docetaxel.  
Hepatotoxicity cases were reported in ARASENS study. Cases of DILI were reported in Study 17777 
and their occurrence was balanced across the 2 arms. In addition, the MAH provided a document on 
signal evaluation for DILI across all darolutamide clinical trials and 5 cases were considered to provide 
strong evidence for a causal association between darolutamide and idiosyncratic hepatocellular liver 
injury and both 5 were serious cases: 2 cases from ARASENS (Study 17777), 2 from ARAMIS (Study 
17712), and 1 case that met Hy’s Law from an investigator sponsored research study (ODENZA). 
Therefore, section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated to reflect the cases of hepatic transaminase 
elevations suggestive of a DILI related to darolutamide.  In addition, a warning has been added in 
section 4.4 to reflect that in case of hepatic transaminase elevations suggestive of idiosyncratic 
drug-induced liver injury related to darolutamide, the treatment should be permanently discontinued. 
3.4.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The characterization of the safety profile of darolutamide in mHSPC based on data from study 17777 
remains challenging due to the combination with docetaxel. Reported adverse reactions incidences may 
not be attributable to darolutamide alone but may contain contributions from other medicinal products 
used in combination. This has been reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC in where the adverse reactions 
observed in patients with mHSPC treated with darolutamide in combination with docetaxel have been 
listed  (see  Section  4.8,  Table 2  of  the  SmPC).  Additional  safety  information  when  darolutamide  is 
administered in combination can be found in  the product information of the individual medicinal products   
Despite numbers were low, a higher incidence of cerebral and intracranial haemorrhage was reported in 
the  darolutamide  arm  compared  with  the  placebo  arm.  While  confounding  factors  were  present  a 
potential  relationship with darolutamide (+docetaxel)  could not  be ruled  out at this stage and  will  be 
further monitored in the PSURs.  
With  regards  to  the  carcinogenicity  risk,  a  causal  association  with  darolutamide  couldn’t  be  ruled  out 
based  on  the  available  evidence  presented  so  far.  As  a  result,  “carcinogenicity  potential”  has  been 
Assessment report

Page 143/147 
 
 
 
reclassified  from  “missing  information”  to  “important  potential  risk”  in  the  RMP  and  two  additional 
pharmacovigilance activities have been proposed to further assess this risk.

3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Darolutamide + docetaxel as add-on therapy to standard ADT showed a clinically relevant improvement 
in terms of OS and a delay in the onset of mCRPC. These results were consistently supported by most 
secondary  endpoints  which  are  considered  to  indirectly  reflect  the  quality  of  life  of  patients.  The 
combination darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT in the ARASENS study, significantly reduced the onset of 
castration-resistant disease, prolonged the time to the first SSE, and the time to subsequent systemic 
antineoplastic therapy. 
The overall safety profile of darolutamide in the treatment of adult men with metastatic hormone 
sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and 
docetaxel was consistent with the known safety profile of darolutamide and there were no unexpected 
findings. The majority of adverse events reported with darolutamide + docetaxel + ADT combination in 
mHSPC patients were severe and the frequency of serious adverse events was not negligible but 
comparable to the one reported with placebo+docetaxel+ADT. Although the combination with 
docetaxel makes the characterization of the safety profile of darolutamide in mHSPC challenging, ALT 
increased, hypertension and gynaecomastia were identified as new ADR of darolutamide. Furthermore, 
cases of hepatic transaminase elevations suggestive of idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury related 
to darolutamide were reported with darolutamide and managed with darolutamide discontinuation.  
Overall, the safety profile is considered manageable and well tolerated, based on the frequencies of 
SAEs, AE leading to treatment discontinuation and AES leading to death, with no major differences 
over placebo. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In study ARASENS darolutamide + docetaxel + ADR showed a clinically relevant and statistically 
significant benefit in terms of OS versus docetaxel + ADT for patients with mHSPC while the safety 
profile of darolutamide with docetaxel was consistent with the known safety profile of the two products 
and manageable with adequate risk minimisation measures.  
3.6.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
None  
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Nubeqa is positive in the following indication:   
NUBEQA is indicated for the treatment of adult men with metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer 
(mHSPC) in combination with docetaxel and androgen deprivation therapy (see section 5.1).

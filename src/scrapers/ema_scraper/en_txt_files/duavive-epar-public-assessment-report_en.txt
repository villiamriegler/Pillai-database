1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The  Applicant  Pfizer  Limited  submitted  on  26  June  2012  an  application  for  Marketing  Authorisation  to  the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Duavive, through the centralised procedure under Article 3 (2) (a) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 
18 March 2010.  
The Applicant initially applied for the following indication: The treatment of oestrogen deficiency symptoms in 
postmenopausal women. The treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture. 
Duavive is indicated in postmenopausal women with a uterus (with 12 months since the last menses). When 
determining whether to use DUAVIVE or other therapies, including oestrogens, for an individual postmenopausal 
woman, consideration should be given to menopausal symptoms, effects on uterine and breast tissues, and 
cardiovascular risks and benefits (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 10(b) of Directive 2001/83/EC – relating to applications for new fixed combination products. 
The application submitted is a new fixed combination medicinal product.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This application concerns a fixed dose combination (FDC) of bazedoxifene acetate (BZA), a selective oestrogen 
receptor modulator (SERM), and conjugated oestrogens (CE) (BZA/CE). 
Loss of oestrogen production in women during menopause results in a state of oestrogen deficiency, which has 
been associated with multiple symptoms, including vasomotor symptoms (VMS), symptoms of vulvar-vaginal 
atrophy (VVA), and difficulties with sleep, mood, memory, and sexual activity. In addition, oestrogen deficiency 
has  further  been  associated  with  loss  of  bone  mass,  which  often  leads  to  osteoporosis.  The  only  hormone

replacement  therapy  (HRT)  treatment  option  currently  approved  to  address  postmenopausal  symptoms  in 
women with a uterus is progestin containing HRT which has been associated with vaginal bleeding, breast pain 
/ tenderness, and increases in breast density. The combination of BZA with CE is considered by the Applicant to 
provide an alternative treatment option to progestin containing HRT. 
BZA has been approved in the EU as Conbriza® and in Japan as Viviant® for the treatment of postmenopausal 
osteoporosis in women at increased risk of fracture, and has also been approved in a number of other countries 
for the prevention or treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.  
CE are obtained from natural sources and are a mixture of sodium estrone sulphate, sodium equilin sulfate, and 
concomitant 
components, 
sodium 
sulfate 
conjugates, 
17α-dihydroequilin, 
17α-estradiol, 
and 
17β-dihydroequilin. CE is a well-established therapy for the treatment of oestrogen deficiency symptoms (EDS) 
in  postmenopausal  women,  available  in  the  US  since  1942  and  in  the  EU  since  the  early  1950s  but  due  to 
established risks HRT should be administered in the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration and should 
only be continued as long as the benefit in alleviation of severe symptoms outweighs the risks of HRT. With 
regard to prevention of osteoporosis, the therapeutic indication within the EU was limited to patients who are 
intolerant of or contraindicated to other medicinal products approved for the prevention of osteoporosis. CE is 
administered as a monotherapy in hysterectomised patients. In women with an intact uterus, a progestin has to 
be added in order to prevent the increased risk of endometrial carcinoma associated with oestrogen alone HRT. 
Combinations of CE and MPA are approved and available in some EU countries. 
BZA has both tissue selective oestrogen receptor agonist and antagonist activity, with agonist activity on the 
skeletal system and antagonist activity in breast and uterine tissues. The multiple oestrogens in CE have tissue 
selective oestrogen receptor agonist activity. Measured outcomes are supposed to be a result of a composite of 
the components’ effects distinct from BZA and CE single effects. 
The  developmental  rationale  for  the  combination  was  based  on  the  assumption  that  BZA  would  inhibit 
proliferative effects of CE on the endometrium reducing the incidence of irregular uterine bleeding and prevent 
oestrogenic stimulatory effects of CE in breast tissue thus not inducing breast pain / tenderness or changes in 
breast  density  associated  with  traditional  progestin-containing  hormone  therapy  (HT),  while  established 
benefits  of  oestrogen  therapy  (ET)  for  the  treatment  of  postmenopausal  EDS  are  maintained  with  the  fixed 
combination therapy. The Applicant considered the fixed combination therapy of BZA/CE as an alternative to 
current HRT (i.e. oestrogen plus progestin [E+P]) by offering benefits of replacing oestrogen, while reducing 
side effects and risks associated with oestrogen plus progestin use. 
The Applicant initially applied for the following indication:  
Duavive is indicated for: 
- The treatment of oestrogen deficiency symptoms in postmenopausal women. 
- The treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture. 
Duavive is indicated in postmenopausal women with a uterus (with 12 months since the last menses). When 
determining whether to use DUAVIVE or other therapies, including oestrogens, for an individual postmenopausal 
woman, consideration should be given to menopausal symptoms, effects on uterine and breast tissues, and 
cardiovascular risks and benefits (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Two strengths were initially included in this application: BZA/CE 20 mg / 0.45 mg as well as 20 mg / 0.625 mg. 
During the procedure the MAH withdrew the indication for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal 
women at increased risk of fracture and the higher strength BZA/CE 20 mg / 0.625 mg. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/383987/2014 
Page 13/153 
  
  
 
 
 
At the end of the procedure the following indication was granted a positive Opinion by the CHMP:  
Treatment of oestrogen deficiency symptoms in postmenopausal women with a uterus (with at least 12 months 
since the last menses) for whom treatment with progestin-containing therapy is not appropriate.   
The experience treating women older than 65 years is limited. 
The recommended dose for DUAVIVE is 0.45 mg conjugated oestrogens (CE) and 20 mg bazedoxifene taken as 
a single oral tablet, once daily.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Conjugated Oestrogens 
General information  
The “active substance” Conjugated Oestrogens is a mixture of different estrogenic substances isolated from 
pregnant mare’s urine.  Conjugated oestrogens is a known entity which is monographed in the European 
Pharmacopoeia. The main components are estrone sulphate (NES) and equiline sulphate (NEQS) and they are 
accompanied by other chemical closely related substances. A classification and differentiation is given as 
primary components, concomitant components, other components and signal impurities as per the Ph Eur. Their 
structural formulae are shown below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/383987/2014 
Page 15/153 
  
  
 
 
 
 
The  European  Pharmacopoeia  specifies  that  the  mixture  of  conjugated  oestrogens  is  dispersed  in  a  suitable 
powdered  diluent.  The  active  substance  used  in  Duavive  has  been  designed  as  Conjugated  Oestrogens

It  appears  as  a  pale yellow-brown  coloured,  hygroscopic,  amorphous  powder,  soluble  in  water.  Since  CEDL 
comprises a mixture of active estrogenic substances isolated from natural sources, extensive information on its 
physical  characteristics  is  not  available.  The  components  of  the  conjugated  oestrogens  have  several 
stereocenters. The manufacturing process only consists of extraction of the conjugated oestrogens from urine 
and mixing with excipients. There are no manufacturing steps which would alter the natural occurring isomerism 
of the components. 
The active substance is packaged in material which comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The manufacturing process does not involve any chemical steps. The active substance, defined as conjugated 
oestrogens desiccation with lactose (CEDL), is manufactured by extraction of pregnant mare’s urine (PMU) and 
by  further  processing  with  excipients  it  to  yield  CEDL  which  is  then  milled  analysed  and  packed  into  LDPE 
containers.  
PMU  is  collected  during  a  predetermined  period  of  the  gestation  of  pregnant  mares.  Two  methods  of 
preservation of PMU are currently proposed. However, since one of them involves the use of an organic solvent 
and since it is possible to completely avoid its use, it is recommended that this option is removed (see 2.2.6. 
Recommendations  for  future  quality  development).The  manufacturing  process  is  designed  to  minimise  the 
potential for increase in bioburden.  
The process has been described in sufficient detail and suitable IPCs have been provided. The in-process tests 
are predominantly product-related tests, however, it has been shown that oestrogen composition is consistent 
between the incoming PMU and the bulk intermediate PCUD and throughout the PCUD manufacturing process 
which  is  considered  as  reflecting  a  controlled,  validated  manufacturing  process.  The  characterisation  of  the

active  substance  and  its  impurities  are  in  accordance  with  the  EU  guideline  on  chemistry  of  new  active 
substances and the Ph Eur. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and 
characterised. 
Appropriate validation data covering the entire complex manufacturing process have been provided. Control of 
manufacture has been adequately addressed by risk assessment, which was employed to classify manufacturing 
process parameters and to identify critical steps in the manufacture of PCUD and CEDL, and by assessing the 
potential impact they may have on product quality and process robustness. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests and limits for: appearance (visual), identification (Ph. Eur., GC), 
total Conjugated Oestrogens content (Ph. Eur. or GC), assay of CE primary components (Ph. Eur. or GC), assay 
of  Concomitant  Components  (Ph.  Eur.  or  GC),  impurities  (Ph.  Eur.  or  GC),  free  steroids  (Ph.  Eur.),  residual 
solvents  (GC)  and  moisture  (KF).  The  specification  is  considered  appropriate  and  complying  with  the 
requirements of the respective EP monograph. Additional tests and adequate limits for moisture and residual 
solvents (including the preservative solvent) have been set. The analytical methods used have been adequately 
described and appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.    
Batch results of eight production batches of active substance CEDL manufactured by the proposed manufacturer 
together  with  data  from  another  17  historical  batches  have  been  submitted.  The  results  are  within  the 
specifications and the consistency of active substance quality is sufficiently confirmed.  
Stability 
Stability data on seven production batches of CEDL from the proposed manufacturer, three of them stored in the 
intended commercial package, for up to 24 months under long term refrigerated conditions (2°C – 8°C) and for 
up to six months under accelerated conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The  parameters  tested  were  the  same  as  for  release  with  the  omission  of  tests  for  residual  solvents  and 
identification. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
Stability data for the three batches which have been stored in the proposed EU compliant bag are comparable to 
the data for batches packed into a different material. All the tested parameters for all batches have met the 
specification during stability studies. No significant loss in content of any of the ten single oestrogen-sulfate 
derivatives  of  the  active  substance  complex  (conjugated  oestrogens)  was  observed  under  the  long  term 
refrigerated or even under the accelerated conditions. No trends were observed. 
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  active  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  manufacturer  is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions in the proposed 
container.

Bazedoxifene 
General information 
The  chemical  name  (IUPAC)  of 
the  active  substance  bazedoxifene  acetate 
is  1H-Indol-5-ol, 
1-[[4-[2-(hexahydro-1H-azepin-1-yl)  ethoxy]phenyl]  methyl]-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-methyl-,monoacetate 
corresponding  to  the  molecular  formula  C30H34N2O3•C2H4O2  and  has  molecular  mass  of  530.65.  It  has  the 
following structure:  
It appears as a white to tan non-hygroscopic crystalline powder. It exists in at least three crystalline 
polymorphic forms which can be differentiated with DSC. The route of synthesis is reported to yield only form I. 
It does not show any optical activity.  
Bazedoxifene solubility in water is largely pH dependent showing plateau of approx. 0.5 mg/ml below pH 5.  
The active substance is packaged in material which comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Bazedoxifene acetate (BZA) is synthesised in four main chemical steps followed by micronisation, using well 
defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. Two alternate routes have been adequately described, 
differing  only  in  step  two.  The  remaining  steps  for  both  processes  are  identical.  The  starting  materials  are 
considered  acceptable  taking  into  account  the  subsequent  process  steps  and  the  fact  that  they  have  been 
characterised  and  quality  controls  in  place  are  considered  adequate.  The  characterisation  of  the  active 
substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential  and  actual  impurities  were  well  discussed  with  regards  to  their  origin  and  characterised.  The 
polymorphism  of  bazedoxifene  has  been  thoroughly  investigated  and  it  has  been  shown  that  the  process 
consistently yields the desired form. 
The  manufacturing  in-process  controls  (IPCs),  control  of  materials,  critical  steps  and  intermediates  are  well 
defined and adequate to ensure consistent manufacture.  
The manufacturing process has been qualified at commercial scale. A validation plan and summary report of a 
prospective validation has been provided in adequate detail. 
The information on the active substance was provided according to the Active Substance Master File (ASMF) 
procedure.

Specification 
The  drug  substance  specification  includes  tests  and limits  for  appearance  (visual),  identification  (IR,  HPLC), 
assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water (Ph Eur), residue on ignition (Ph Eur), acetic acid 
content  (HPLC),  palladium  content  (ICP-OES),  heavy  metals  (Ph  Eur),  particle  size  (laser  diffraction)  and 
polymorphic  forms  (DSC,  XRD).  The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and 
(non-compendial  methods)  appropriately  validated  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  guidelines.  The  polymorphic 
purity  specifications  are  set  in  line  with  Decision  Tree  #4  in  ICH  Q6A.  Particle  size  limits  have  been  also 
sufficiently justified. 
Batch analysis data are provided for eight commercial scale batches produced using both processes. The results 
show compliance with the proposed specification and no significant differences in purity or impurity contents 
across the batch size range. Additional results from historical batches of various batch sizes were also presented. 
The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability studies on three commercial scale batches of active substance manufactured with process 2 and nine 
pilot  scale  batches  according  to  process  1,  all  by  the  proposed  manufacturer  and  stored  in  the  intended 
commercial primary package were conducted. Results for up to 36 months under long term conditions (5 ± 3 °C 
/ambient  humidity)  and  intermediated  conditions  (25  ºC  /  60%  RH)  and  for  six  months  under  accelerated 
conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were presented.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance, water, impurities, assay and polymorphic form II. 
The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. No significant changes 
are observed.  
Additional supportive stability studies on twelve batches packaged in double LDPE bags in HDPE containers, 
including batches manufactured according to process 1 and process 2 using alternate drying equipment and 
micronised at the proposed site were initiated to evaluate the use of three types of dryers.  An additional twelve 
batches were placed on stability in order to investigate polymorphic form conversion. These batches include 
batches manufactured according to process 1 and process 2, using alternate drying equipment, micronised at 
the proposed site and packaged in double LDPE bags in HPPE containers. 
Furthermore, stability results of three industrial lots of unmicronised BZA show no significant changes when 
stored  at  5°C  or  25°C/  60%  RH  for  36  months.    The  proposed  holding  time  for  storage/  transport  of 
unmicronised bulk substance is accepted.  
Photostability testing was also performed on one industrial scale batch following the ICH guideline Q1B. Results 
do not indicate any significant concern regarding photostability under the conditions tested. Results on stress 
conditions: heat, oxidative, acidic, basic and light conditions revealed significant degradation after treatment 
with light, hydrogen peroxide and basic solution. 
In conclusion, the data collected to date under all studied conditions support the proposed retest period, storage 
conditions and packaging material for both the unmicronised and micronised active substance.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Duavive  is  a  modified  release  film-coated  tablet,  designed  to  provide  an  immediate  release  of  BZA  in 
combination with a controlled release of CE. The development was based on the Applicant’s experience with the 
current marketed CE mono-product. The composition and manufacturing process of the mono-product tablet 
has  been  updated.  The  proposed  product  consists  of  the  updated  core  tablet  of  the  mono-product  with  the 
additional BZA active substance coated around the tablet core. The tablet consists of four layers. The tablet core 
contains the conjugated oestrogens and is coated with an inert filler is identical to the current CE mono-product. 
This coated tablet is further coated with an active coating containing the other active substance BZA. The two 
outer layers are colour coating and clear coating. The choice of the excipients has been satisfactorily justified 
and their function in this modified release formulation has been adequately described.  
Their quality is compliant with Ph Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product 
formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
Conjugated oestrogens is a well-known mixture of water-soluble estrogenic substances described in Ph Eur. The 
composition  of  CEDL  has  remained  consistent  over  the  many  years  of  manufacture  of  the  current  CE 
mono-product. 
The acetate salt of bazedoxifene was chosen due to its physicochemical properties. Those with impact on drug 
development were solubility, permeability, solid state properties including polymorphism, chemical stability and 
particle size. BZA has low solubility; however it is highly soluble at gastric pH. Permeability is high implying a 
potential  for  high  bioavailability,  hence  BZA  is  classified  as  a  BCS  class  II  compound.  Crystalline  BZA  is 
micronised in order to improve the dissolution rate. The impact of particle size on drug product was evaluated. 
Solubility, intrinsic dissolution and conversion of the different polymorphs were also studied. It was concluded 
that tablets spiked with low levels of potential polymorphic impurities exhibited similar dissolution profiles as 
unspiked tablets and that no conversion of the polymorphic form occurs under the manufacturing conditions 
used  or  during  storage  under  ICH  conditions;  therefore  polymorphism  is  only  controlled  in  the  BZA  release 
specifications. 
Two dissolution methods have been developed; one for each substance. For the BZA dissolution method the 
discriminatory power regarding BZA particle size was studied on pilot as well as commercial scale batches. The 
dissolution method was shown to be discriminatory with regard to the particle size distribution.  
Although there is no evidence to suggest that the ratio of the amorphous form of BZA to the crystalline active 
substance form is critical to bioavailability, the proposed dissolution method has been shown to be biorelevant 
since it has sufficient discriminatory power to detect non-bioequivalent batches and thus provides a measure of 
holistic control. In addition, PK data from multiple clinical studies support the above conclusion. Moreover the 
probability of bioequivalent batches passing the dissolution specification has been calculated and it is concluded 
that the probability that a non-bioequivalent batch would meet the proposed specification is negligible. 
The dissolution method for the CE was based on the already developed method for the current marketed CE 
mono-product, for which for which a Level A in-vitro/in-vivo correlation (IVIVC) had been established. However, 
as the proposed CE dissolution method for Duavive was different to the one upon which the IVIVC had been 
based, a new level A IVIVC has been developed based on the new commercial dissolution method and suitable 
formulation variants, thereby demonstrating the biorelevance of the CE dissolution method for Duavive tablets.

In conclusion the chosen dissolution methods and conditions have been sufficiently justified and in addition the 
development of an IVIVC for CE and a discriminating dissolution method for BZA is described in detail. 
Development of the proposed formulation and manufacturing process has been described in sufficient detail. 
Elements  of  Quality  by  Design  (such  as  design  of  experiments)  have  been  applied  to  development  of  the 
manufacturing process; however, no design space is claimed.  During the development programme, there were 
several changes made to manufacturing equipment, scale and sites. Manufacturing process development of the 
different  clinical  and  the  proposed  commercial  formulation  was  focused  on  maintaining  equivalency  of  the 
quality attributes of the product while addressing the site to site changes in the manufacturing equipment. Each 
unit  operation  was  evaluated  to  develop  process  understanding  and  determine  appropriate  ranges  for  the 
process.  The  following  quality  attributes  of  the  BZA/CE  tablets  were  identified  and  investigated  regarding 
influence through process parameters: content uniformity, dissolution profile, strength and ID for both active 
substances as well as impurities, moisture, antioxidant, appearance, and microbial attributes. Control charts 
and  DOE  data  were  provided  for  the  evaluated  process  parameters.  Equivalency  of  the  CE  tablet  core 
manufactured by different sites during the development was established by comparing critical quality attributes 
and including a statistical evaluation (f2) of dissolution profiles.  
Finally during scale-up and transfer of the process to the commercial site, the BZA exposure was studied in vivo. 
The optimisation of the BZA coating process and the level of excipients in the active coating ensured the desired 
dissolution profile and the corresponding in vivo PK performance. Thus, comparability of both sites regarding 
consistent quality has been demonstrated.  
Duavive tablets are packaged in a PVC/Aclar/PVC/Alu blister, which is then sealed in an aluminium foil laminate 
pouch. The material complies with the EP requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of the following main steps: preparation of the CE core tablets coated with 
the inert filler suspension and preparation of the finished tablets.  
The CE core tablets are manufactured by mixing CEDL with tablet core excipients, wet granulation and drying, 
lubrication and compression. The finished tablets are manufactured by coating the CE core tablets by the inert 
filler, followed by active BZA coating. The BZA coated tablets are subsequently coated first with a colour and 
finally with a clear coating. The manufacturing process is considered to be a non-standard process because the 
content  of  the  conjugated  oestrogens  is  below  2%  and  also  because  the  tablets  are  modified  release. 
Intermediates and critical steps have been properly identified. The in-process controls are adequate for this type 
of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
The manufacturing process has been validated using three production scale batches which have been produced 
in the same manufacturing facilities and process as for the batches intended  for marketing. The results are 
compliant with specifications. It can be concluded that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the 
finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner.

Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  and  limits  for  appearance  (visual), 
identification of CE (GC), identification of BZA (HPLC, UV), assay for total CE and NEQS to NES ratio (GC), CE 
potency (GC), assay for BZA (HPLC), Uniformity of Dosage Units for CE and BZA (HPLC), BZA related substances 
(HPLC), ascorbic acid (HPLC), water content (Ph Eur), dissolution for CE (Ph Eur-HPLC), dissolution for BZA (Ph 
Eur-UV) and microbial limits (Ph Eur).  
The  proposed  release  specification  limit  for  total  Conjugated  Oestrogens  assay  was  set  upon  the  statistical 
analysis of a large number of CE related products and from 27 batches of Duavive and of the current marketed 
CE mono-product stored at 25 ºC/60 % RH for up to 36 months. The limit is considered acceptable; nevertheless, 
it should be reviewed upon availability of more data from Duavive tablets (see 2.2.6. Recommendations for 
future quality development). 
The  proposed  shelf-life  limit  for  BZA  assay  was  predicated  upon  the  statistical  analysis  from  14  recently 
manufactured batches and is considered acceptable; the lower limit for shelf life should be re-evaluated upon 
availability of more data from Duavive tablets. (see 2.2.6. Recommendations for future quality development). 
Batch analysis results are provided for three production scale batches. Results confirm the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three production scale batches of Duavive tablets stored under long term conditions for up to 36 
months at 25 ºC / 60% RH, up to 12 months at 30°C/75% RH and for six months under accelerated conditions 
at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The stability batches were packed in the 
primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested according to ICH guidance for appearance, BZA assay and related substances, total CE, 
sum  of  equilin  and  estrone,  ratio  equilin/estrone,  equilin,  estrone,  degradation  products  of  the  conjugated 
oestrogens, water content, dissolution of CE and BZA, ascorbic acid and a leak test. Initially and after 12, 24 and 
36 months, polymorphism and microbiological quality were additionally tested.  All parameters tested remained 
within the limits set and there were no significant changes in assay of active substance, as well as in any other 
parameter tested. The analytical procedures used were the same as for release and are stability indicating. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug 
Substances and Products. No significant changes were observed in any of the attributes that were monitored; 
therefore, it is concluded that the Duavive tablets are not light sensitive and no precautionary packaging or 
labelling is required. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
The  only  excipient  derived  from  animal  sources  is  lactose  monohydrate.  Suppliers  of  lactose  confirm  it  is

Satisfactory information has been provided regarding the implemented herd health system for the oversight of 
the PMU ranches, where the starting material is collected and this has been substantiated by specific information. 
Virus  safety  of  the  drug  substance  is  exclusively  based  on  virus  inactivation/  removal  capacity  of  the 
manufacturing  process.  Enveloped  as  well  as  non-enveloped  viruses  representing  a  broad  range  of 
physical-chemical characteristics have been included in the virus validation studies. The panel of model viruses 
chosen for the validation study is thus considered appropriate. The validity of the claimed virus reduction has 
been supported by adequate data. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Duavive film-coated tablets is a fixed dose combination of two active substances formulated in a special type of 
dosage form that allows immediate release of bazedoxifene and prolonged release of the conjugated oestrogens. 
Information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  both  active  substances  has  been  presented  in  a 
satisfactory manner. Key aspects of both active substances in relation to the safety and clinical performance of 
the  product  were  taken  into  account  during  the  design  and  development  of  the  product  and  have  been 
satisfactorily  addressed.  In  this  context  it  is  also  recommended  that  the  manufacture  of  CE  is  updated 
post-authorisation by the appropriate variation procedure(s) as discussed above. Elements of Quality by Design 
have  been  applied  to  development  of  the  manufacturing  process  confirming  the  Applicant’s  enhanced 
understanding of the manufacturing process however no design space is claimed. Sufficient information on the 
development, manufacture and control of this modified release product is also presented with emphasis on the 
consistency  of  product  quality  and  clinical  performance.  It  is  expected  that  when  data  from  more  product 
batches become available that certain specification limits should be reviewed in the light of a larger dataset. The 
results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important quality product characteristics, and 
these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in 
clinical use.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no impact on 
the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC.  Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Sufficient information has been presented to 
give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP 
recommends the following points for investigation:

1. The  Applicant  should  provide  a  post-authorisation  variation  to  remove  the  organic  solvent  from  the 
proposed manufacturing process of CE and replace with refrigeration of PMU. 
2. The  Applicant  should  critically  review  the  limits  for  TCEC  during  release  and  shelf  life  upon  the 
availability of a significant body of data. Data should be provided via an appropriate variation if needed 
at the latest by the time of renewal. 
3. The Applicant should critically review the lower shelf-life limit for bazedoxifene upon the availability of a 
significant body of data. Data should be provided via an appropriate variation if needed at the latest by 
the time of renewal.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
In nonclinical studies, bazedoxifene (BZA), either alone or in combination with conjugated oestrogens (CE) or 
17β estradiol (17β E2), was administered as the acetate salt, and doses are expressed in terms of the free base, 
bazedoxifene.  For the oral gavage studies, the vehicle used was 1% polysorbate 80 and 0.5% methylcellulose 
in purified water.  In studies where bazedoxifene was administered in combination with CE or 17β E2, the vehicle 
for the oestrogens was 0.5% methylcellulose and purified water. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
According to the intended use (combination of CE and BZA, in postmenopausal women without addition of a 
progestin)  the  Applicant  tried  to  demonstrate  in  the  non-clinical  primary  PD  programme  that  BZA  does  not 
interfere with the desired effects of CE on bone and in regard to hot flushes but prevents or at least attenuates 
the undesired (proliferative) effects of CE on uterus and breasts. At the time of the evaluation of this application 
the combination of a SERM with an oestrogen was not in therapeutic use in the EU. In order to justify this new 
approach, the Applicant also intended to show that BZA differs from other SERMs pharmacologically in a relevant 
way.  Most  of  the  PD  studies  were  explorative  in  character,  investigating  for  example  changes  in  the  gene 
expression  profile  which  does  not  allow  immediate  conclusions  for  the  therapeutic  use  of  the  BZA/CE 
combination. Nevertheless, a 1-year study in an OVX rat osteopenia model was also conducted in which the 
effects of CE and BZA, alone and in combination on bone were extensively studied. Effects on uterus were also 
determined, albeit much less extensive, e.g. without histology. In vivo effects of the BZA/CE combination on the 
mammary gland were investigated to a limited extent only. 
The following table summarises the PD studies performed with CE and BZA in combination and provided a short 
description of the outcome.

RPT-68443  Three different SERMs, BZA, RAL and LAS), alone or in 
combination with CE, induced changes in gene 
expression in the immature rat uterus (measured on 
whole genome DNA arrays). Each treatment induced a 
slightly different pattern. The clinical relevance of 
these changes is unknown. 
RPT-73139  Mammary gland morphology and amphiregulin 
(AREG) expression in the mammary gland were 
followed. E2 als well as 3 and 10 mg/kg CE markedly 
induced AREG. RAL, LAS and BZA markedly attenuated 
the CE effect (not tested with E2), most pronounced 
for BZA (used in a dose of 2 mg/kg).  
Morphology was shown as one whole mount 
photomicrograph per treatment but was not quantified 
or statistically evaluated so that firm conclusions are 
not possible.

diminished the time to vessel occlusion. CE alone had 
no statistical significant effect. Although BZA 
numerically reversed the CE effect, no firm conclusions 
can be drawn due to the lack of statistical significance. 
GTR-35197  Co-administration of CE with all BZA doses protected 
from OVX-induced bone loss; the maximal effect of the 
combination appeared to plateau between 0.3 and 
1 mg/kg BZA with a slight attenuation of the effects 
with the high dose. 1 mg/kg BZA completely blocked 
the uterine stimulatory activity of CE (0.5 mg/kg)

BZA/CE effect on rat hot flush model 
In a rat hot flush model based on naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal, CE at 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg 
doses, suppressed the hot flush (rise in tail skin temperature following naloxone withdrawal) in rats. When CE 
(10 mg/kg) was co-administered with BZA at 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, 10.0 mg/kg, BZA antagonized CE’s suppression 
of the tail skin temperature rise to some extent in two experiments. There was no clear dose dependency.

BZA/CE effect on rat uterus 
Uterine weight was determined in most in vivo PD studies, in mice and rats. CE (or another oestrogen) increased 
uterine weight as expected. BZA counteracted this effect dose-dependently. Full antagonism was seen in mice 
at  10 mg/kg  BZA.  In  rat  studies,  lower  doses  were  employed,  leading  to  incomplete  inhibition  of  the 
oestrogen-induced  increase  in  uterine  weight.  Other  uterine  parameters  (e.g.  histology,  endometrium 
proliferation) were not studied in the PD studies. 
BZA/CE effect on rat mammary gland 
One PD study in rats aimed to investigate the effects of BZA, CE and the combination thereof on rat mammary 
gland  in  vivo.  However,  rather  untypical  parameters  were  determined,  such  as  expression  of  the  gene 
amphiregulin  and  qualitative  evaluation  of  whole  mounts  of  the  mammary  gland.  No  histology  data  and  no 
proliferation markers were obtained. Thus, although the CE effect on amphiregulin expression was counteracted 
by BZA, this study only allows limited conclusions in respect to breast safety of the BZA/CE combination. The 
Applicant also presented in vitro data, obtained with the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. BZA at 1 nM was 
able  to  virtually  completely  counteract  the  proliferative  effect  of  CE  on  these  cells.  This  is  reassuring,  but 
extrapolation from tumour cells in vitro to neoplastic disease in vivo is difficult. 
BZA/CE effect on bone 
Bone effects were examined in a six week and in a one year study in OVX rats. The design of the 1-year study 
(RPT-58143) can be summarised as follows: 
Animals in Groups 1 to 7 underwent surgical procedures; animals in 6 of these groups were ovariectomised at 
the age of approximately 6 months (OVX Groups 2 to 7) and animals in one group (Group 1) served as Sham 
controls, while animals in Group 8 served as baseline controls. Bazedoxifene and/or CE was administered orally 
by  gavage  to  female  Sprague-Dawley  CD®  (Crl:CD®  (SD)BR)  rats  (24/group)  once  daily  for  at  least  52 
consecutive  weeks.  Bazedoxifene  and  CE  were  administered  either  separately  at  0.3  or  2.5 mg/kg/day, 
respectively, or in combination at dosages of 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg/kg/day of BZA with 2.5 mg/kg/day of CE. 
Control groups received the vehicle consisting of 1.0% Polysorbate 80, NF (Tween 80) and 0.5% methylcellulose 
in deionized water. Dosing of animals was initiated the day after ovariectomy was performed. A baseline group 
of animals was euthanized at the end of the acclimation period. These animals were used to provide additional 
perspective  for  histomorphometric  evaluation  and  biomechanical  tests.  Evaluations  for  compound-related 
effects  were  based  on  mortality,  clinical  observations,  body  weight,  food  consumption,  clinical  chemistry, 
urinalysis, biochemical markers of bone turnover, hormones, bone densitometry consisting of duel energy x-ray 
absorptiometry  (DXA)  and  quantitative  computed  tomography  (pQCT),  organ  weights,  macroscopic 
examinations, histomorphometry, and biomechanical testing. 
The main finding was that BZA did not inhibit the desirable CE effects on bone (and vice versa) but there was no 
additive effect of BZA and CE on the bone. BZA in the doses tested (up to 1 mg/kg) inhibited CE-induced uterine 
weight gain, but not completely. In the six week study (OVX rat), 3 mg/kg BZA slightly inhibited the CE-induced 
increase in trabecular bone density. Taken together, BZA did not inhibit desired bone effects at doses up to 
1 mg/kg but slightly inhibited the desired CE effect  on experimental hot flushes and could not fully prevent 
CE-induced increase in uterine weight. The effect of BZA, CE and the combination on the mammary gland was 
not studied sufficiently.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No specific secondary PD studies were performed with the BZA/CE combination. Effects of these compounds on 
other organs beside bone (the intended target) were investigated within the frame of the primary PD studies and 
are therefore described in the primary PD section above. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
No safety pharmacology studies were performed with the combination BZA/CE. CE is well-established, and the 
risks  are  known  from  clinical  experience.  Safety  pharmacology  of  BZA  was  studied  previously,  yielding  no 
findings of concern. From the molecular mechanism of action it is not expected that the combination of CE and 
BZA would reveal fundamentally different effects that were not observed with the individual compounds alone. 
Hence, omission of safety studies with the combination was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
PD interactions between CE and BZA (and other SERMs) were extensively studied in the primary PD studies as 
described in the respective section above. No other PD interaction studies were performed. 
The lack of further PD interaction studies was considered acceptable by the CHMP. PD interactions of oestrogens 
and SERMs with other compounds (e.g. progestins) are established and are not expected to be fundamentally 
different when CE and BZA are combined. Furthermore, it is not intended to combine BZA/CE with drugs capable 
of PD interaction. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic properties of the individual components of the BZA/CE combination are well known. The 
Applicant conducted an in vitro study in liver cell extracts to demonstrate that the metabolic pathways of BZA 
and  estrone  and  equilin  (main  constituents  of  CE)  essentially  do  not  interfere  with  each  other.  No  in  vivo 
interaction  study  in  animals  was  provided.  Plasma  levels  of  BZA  after  administration  of  BZA  alone  and  in 
combination with CE were determined clinically. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
No single-dose studies with the BZA/CE combination were performed. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Four (4) repeated-dose toxicology studies were performed with the BZA/CE combination, two in rats and two in 
monkeys. One study in each species was of shorter duration (1 month) whereas the other had the full duration 
required for a new substance intended for long-term use, namely 6 month plus 3 months recovery in rats and 9 
months in monkeys. The findings of the shorter studies are in line with the observations in the longer studies 
described below. 
6-Month with 3-Month Recovery, Rats 
BZA and CE were administered individually by gavage to female S-D rats (30/group) at BZA/CE dosages of 0/0, 
3/0.33, 12/1, or 60/3 mg/kg/day for 6 months.

An increased incidence (compared with controls) of alopecia occurred at a dosage of 60/3 mg/kg/day during the 
dosing period and persisted during the recovery period and was attributed to the estrogenic activity of BZA/CE. 
During  the  dosing  period,  test-article-related,  but  not  dose-related,  decreases  (25%  to  27%)  in  mean 
body-weight gains were associated with slight decreases (7% to 9%) in mean body weight at week 27 in all 
treated groups, compared with the control group. Test-article-related, but not dose-related, slight decreases 
(6% to 9%) in mean food consumption also occurred over the course of the study in all treated groups. These 
effects were reversible after the 3-month test-article-free recovery period. There were no test-article-related 
ophthalmoscopic  effects  or  alterations 
in  haematology  parameters.  There  were  no  noteworthy 
test-article-related changes in clinical chemistry parameters or organ weights, with the exception of the uterus, 
as described below. 
Decreases  (12%  to  24%)  in  absolute  and  relative  (to  body  and  brain)  mean  weights  of  the  uterus  at 
≥12/1 mg/kg/day  were  observed.  Microscopic  changes  included  an  increased  incidence  of  slight  to  marked 
cystic follicular arrest of the ovary, an increased incidence of slight to moderate microscopic dilatation of the 
uterine lumen (≥12/1 mg/kg/day), slight or mild squamous metaplasia of the uterine endometrial epithelium, 
and slight or mild atrophy of the uterus. Based on vaginal morphology at final necropsy, animals in all treated 
groups  were  predominantly  in  the  estrous  phase  of  their  cycle.  At  recovery  necropsy  (week  39),  diestrus 
occurred with slightly increased incidence in rats in all treated groups. 
After  the  3-month  test-article-free  recovery  period  (week  39),  cystic  follicular  arrest  of  the  ovary  resolved 
completely; uterus weights returned to normal, but dilatation of the uterine lumen, squamous metaplasia of the 
uterine endometrial epithelium, and atrophy (ie, reduced overall diameter of the uterine horns) of the uterus did 
not resolve at 60/3 mg/kg/day, and there was a modest shift toward diestrus in all treated groups. Slight to 
moderate lobular hyperplasia of the mammary gland occurred with a dose-related increased incidence in all 
treated groups at the recovery necropsy (week 39). Lobular hyperplasia of the mammary gland occurred with 
low incidence at final necropsy (week 26), but was not considered test article related. 
9-Month, Monkeys 
BZA and CE were administered individually by gavage to female cynomolgus monkeys (5/group) at BZA/CE 
dosages of 0/0, 7.5/0.1, 33.5/0.45, or 150/2 mg/kg/day daily for 9 months. Mean liver weights (absolute and 
relative to body and brain) were increased 19% to 20% in monkeys given 150/2 mg/kg/day. No macroscopic or 
microscopic correlates were observed for the increased weights and there were no clinical chemistry changes in 
liver enzymes. The increased liver weights and absence of any macroscopic or microscopic observations were 
comparable to the effects seen at dosages up to 300 mg/kg/day in a 9-month toxicity study in monkeys given 
BZA alone. 
Mean ovary weights (absolute and relative to body and brain) were increased 18% to 32%, 71% to 78%, and 
179%  to  193%  in  monkeys  given  7.5/0.1,  33.5/0.45,  or  150/2 mg/kg/day  of  BZA/CE,  respectively,  when 
compared with controls and correlated microscopically with the presence of slight to moderate cystic follicles, 
which was slightly more severe at 150/2 mg/kg/day of BZA/CE. These findings have been observed in previous 
repeat dose toxicity studies in monkeys with BZA alone. 
Mean uterus weights (absolute and relative to body and brain) were decreased 75% to 79% in monkeys at all 
dosages  of  BZA/CE  when  compared  with  controls  and  correlated  microscopically  with  moderate  to  marked 
atrophy and macroscopically to a small uterus. Marked atrophy of the cervix and moderate to marked atrophy 
of vaginal epithelium occurred in monkeys given ≥7.5/0.1 mg/kg/day of BZA/CE when compared with controls.

The severities of this lesion in these organs were similar at all dosages of BZA/CE and are similar in magnitude 
to the effects seen after administration of BZA alone.  
Cystic follicles in the ovary and atrophy of the uterus, vagina, and cervix have been observed in previous toxicity 
studies in monkeys with BZA alone. 
Genotoxicity 
Bazedoxifene  was  tested  for  genotoxicity  in  a  battery  of  in  vitro  (AMES,  mouse  lymphoma  assay,  and 
chromosome aberration test in CHO cells) and in vivo (mouse micronucleus) assays. All studies were performed 
according to GLP and gave negative results. Therefore bazedoxifene is regarded as devoid of any genotoxic 
potential.  Published  studies  on  genotoxicity  of  CE  revealed  no  significant  increase  in  induced  mutations  or 
chromosome aberrations. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies with the BZA/CE combination were performed. It is known that certain tumours of 
hormone-sensitive tissue depend on estrogenic stimulation, in animals as well as in humans. The underlying 
mechanism is not genotoxic. BZA is intended to mitigate proliferative effects of oestrogens (in particular CE) on 
uterus and breasts. Data from PD and repeated-dose toxicology studies support this intention. Therefore, there 
is  no  hint  that  BZA  could  increase  the  carcinogenic  potential  of  oestrogens.  Furthermore,  rodents  are  very 
sensitive towards oestrogens, and the relevance of rodent findings for humans is unclear in case of oestrogens. 
In consequence, carcinogenesis studies with the combination BZA/CE were not considered necessary. This was 
agreed by the CHMP. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity of BZA alone were evaluated in separate fertility studies for male and 
female rats and embryotoxicity studies in rats and rabbits. Toxicokinetic parameters were obtained within each 
study.  No  study  on  pre-  and  postnatal  development  was  performed.  Male  fertility  was  not  impaired  by  BZA 
treatment up to a dose of 300 mg/kg/day, the highest dose studied. BZA treatment of female rats resulted in 
cessation of estrous cycles and a reduced number of implantations at all dosages. Accordingly, a NOAEL for 
reproductive parameters in females was not identified. Adverse reproductive effects of BZA were consistent with 
the pharmacologic activity. In the embryotoxicity studies performed in rats, decreased embryo-foetal survival, 
decreased  foetal  body  weights,  delayed  ossification  and  an  increase  in  vascular  variations  were  observed 
already at the lowest dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day. In rabbits, administration of BZA resulted in foetal ventricular 
septum defects, anomalies in skeletal development and fetuses with  hydropericardium starting at a dose of 
0.05 mg/kg/day. Since signs of compromised health of the dams were observed in this rabbit study, a second 
study was performed. In the second study, BZA treatment resulted in abortions at doses of 0.5 mg/kg/day, but 
no foetal effects were seen. Effects on reproductive and developmental toxicity were in general already observed 
below human therapeutic exposure levels.  
No  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  studies  were  performed  with  the  combination  BZA/CE.  As 
announced  in  the  Guideline  of  Non-clinical-development  of  fixed  combinations  of  medical  products 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005,  when  single  components  have  been  adequately 
tested  and 
the 
reproductive/developmental toxicity profiles of the compounds are sufficiently characterised, additional studies 
with the combination may not be warranted.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Both  bazedoxifene  and  estrone  /  17β-dihydroequilin  (conjugated  oestrogens)  are  considered  for  the 
environmental risk assessment of Duavive®. For bazedoxifene a phase I and phase II Tier A assessment was 
provided by the Applicant. Based on the available data it was assessed that bazedoxifene is not classified as PBT 
nor expected to bioaccumulate. The data provided by the Applicant do allow concluding that bazedoxifene is 
unlikely to present a risk to the environmental compartments surface water, groundwater and sediment as well 
as  wastewater  microorganisms.  No  final  conclusion  is  possible  on  the  potential  risk  of  bazedoxifene  to  the 
terrestrial environment. Both for estrone and 17β-dihydroequilin a phase II environmental risk assessment has 
been initiated. This assessment will be based on the tier A testing, including experimental determination of log 
D values to perform PBT classification and fish full life cycle evaluation. No conclusion on the potential risk of 
estrone and 17β-dihydroequilin to the environment is possible yet. 
The Applicant committed to provide an updated ERA for bazedoxifene and conjugated oestrogens by end of first 
quarter 2015. This ERA report will include study reports and missing data of PBT and terrestrial risk assessment 
of bazedoxifene as well as experimentally determined log Kow of estrone and 17β-dihydroequilin and results 
from long-term fish test.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The Applicant’s intention of the PD programme was to demonstrate suitability of the BZA/CE combination for 
prevention or treatment of osteoporosis and hot flushes and to avoid undesirable, proliferative actions on breast 
and uterus. Probably because combinations of oestrogens and SERMs are currently uncommon in therapy and 
because  endometrial  protection  is  to  date  mainly  performed  by  adding  a  progestin  instead  of  a  SERM,  the 
Applicant also aimed to demonstrate that BZA is more suitable for this purpose than other SERMs. Therefore, in 
many studies BZA was compared to raloxifene and lasofoxifene. In several studies gene expression profiles were 
investigated; however, the relevance of these results for therapeutic use of BZA/CE is unknown because the 
physiological  meaning  of  the  observed  changes  is  unknown.  Nevertheless,  standard  bone  parameters  and 
uterine weight was also investigated in studies with up to one year duration. It turned out that BZA at suitable 
doses is indeed able to increase BMD and bone stability together with CE and simultaneously to attenuate the 
CE-induced uterine weight gain. However, CE-induced uterine proliferation was not completely blocked by the 
BZA doses used. On the other hand, as revealed in one mouse study, higher doses of BZA may also interfere 
with the bone-saving effect of CE so that the possibility of increasing the BZA dose for better uterine protection 
is limited.  
Although some of the PD studies performed were rather extensive, the data obtained on breast and uterine 
effects of BZA/CE appear incomplete. Uterine effects were only determined as weight gain (or gene expression 
in the whole uterus) but the clinically most important target tissue, the endometrium was not investigated in the 
PD studies. Information on endometrial histology can be derived from the repeated-dose toxicology studies (see 
below). However, more specific investigations like morphometry or determination of proliferation markers at 
doses relevant for the desired bone effect were not performed, and much higher doses of BZA were used in the 
toxicity studies.  
The same concerns also apply for the mammary gland. Apart from effects on gene expression, the relevance of 
which is not fully clear, no quantifiable effects of BZA/CE on the breast and in particular on mammary gland 
histology and proliferation were determined. The presented data suggest that BZA could protect the mammary 
gland  from  undesired  estrogenic  effects.  This  would  be  highly  favourable  because  this  probably  cannot  be 
achieved  by  the  standard  combination  partner  of  CE,  a  progestin.  On  the  other  hand,  in  the  6  month 
repeated-dose toxicity study in rats, mammary gland hyperplasia was observed with the BZA/CE combination 
even  if  the  BZA  dose  used  was  much  higher  than  in  the  PD  studies.  Therefore,  determination  of  relevant 
quantitative standard parameters (e.g. weight, histomorphometry, proliferation markers) to characterise BZA’s 
action on the mammary gland, in particular in respect to proliferation, would have been desirable. The Applicant 
has sponsored studies in monkeys to address these concerns, where BZA and CE alone and in combination were 
administered  to  ovariectomised  cynomolgus  monkeys.  The  dose  levels  were  2.5 mg/kg/day  for  BZA  and 
0.03 mg/kg/day for CE, which according to the authors correspond to the target human combination treatment 
of 20 mg/day for BZA and 0.45 mg/day for CE. Two resulting publications  (Ethun et al., 2012, Menopause 19: 
1242-1252, and Ethun et al., 2013, Menopause 20: 777-784) conclude that BZA at the target human equivalent 
dose fully antagonizes the proliferative and transcriptional effects of CE on the macaque endometrium while 
having  no  oestrogen  agonist  activity  when  given  alone.  Lumbar  bone  mineral  density  was  not  negatively 
affected  by  the  chosen  BZA/CE  dose  ratio  as  compared  to  the  effect  of  CE  alone.  BZA  antagonized  the 
proliferative  and  transcriptional  effects  of  CE  in  the  normal  postmenopausal  nonhuman  primate  breast. 
However,  mammary  gland  proliferation  was  higher  with  the  BZA/CE  combination  than  with  BZA  alone.  This 
means  that  addition  of  CE  to  BZA,  as  intended,  may  alter  the  established  benefit/risk  profile  of  BZA  alone.

Monkey data are considered more relevant for humans than rodent data so that no further rodent studies are 
requested.  
Taken together, the non-clinical PD programme has shown that the approach of combining BZA and CE may be 
feasible but some points remain open from a non-clinical point of view. At least in the non-clinical studies, no 
BZA  dose  could  be  identified  that  did  not  impair  the  desired  CE  effects  on  bone  and  hot  flushes  and 
simultaneously provided full uterine protection. The situation in humans may be different but this conclusion 
could only be reached if confirmed by the assessment of the results of the clinical trials. Effects on the mammary 
gland are much more easily to study  non-clinically than clinically. This information was not provided by the 
Applicant, however it was agreed that on the other hand, the relevance of the non-clinical findings for humans 
remains unclear. 
The pharmacokinetic properties of the individual components of the BZA/CE combination are well known. The 
Applicant conducted an in vitro study in liver cell extracts to demonstrate that the metabolic pathways of BZA 
and  estrone  and  equilin  (main  constituents  of  CE)  essentially  do  not  interfere  with  each  other.  No  in  vivo 
interaction  study  in  animals  was  provided.  Plasma  levels  BZA  and  estrone  after  administration  of  each 
compound alone vs. in combination, were determined clinically. Thus, an additional in vivo PK interaction study 
in animals is not considered necessary because no additional relevant information is expected. 
The Applicant has conducted repeated-dose toxicology studies of the combination in two species, for up to 9 
months in non-rodents (monkeys) and up to 6 months (plus recovery) in rodents (rats). The pharmacodynamic 
and  toxicological  properties  of  both  components  of  the  combination  are  known  and  from  this  no  increased 
toxicity of the combination is expected. This expectation was confirmed by the outcome of the repeated dose 
studies  which  were  performed  with  a  sufficient  number  of  animals  and  used  sufficiently  high  doses  for 
meaningful conclusions. In rats, which are known to be very sensitive towards oestrogens, the estrogenic effects 
of CE dominated the findings with the combination. Vice versa, in monkeys oestrogens have less pronounced 
effects so that in the combination study in this species the BZA effects dominated. All observed effects could be 
related to the hormonal properties of the test compounds; no unexpected toxicities were observed. 
Mammary gland lobular hyperplasia was observed following cessation of treatment with doses giving rise to 
clinically relevant plasma exposure levels. The Applicant ascribes the mammary gland lobular hyperplasia to a 
prolactin  rebound  effect.  This  finding  was  not  made  in  the  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  conducted  with 
bazedoxifene.  It  is  acknowledged  that  post-menopausal  women  naturally  have  a  lower  prolactin  level  than 
pre-menopausal women. The effects observed in the nonclinical studies were ascribed to the ovarian functional 
state in the young cycling animals, whereas the post-menopausal women will have quiescent ovaries. In the 
clinical studies, breast-related adverse event was comparable between the control and treated groups.  
Since no histological evaluation was performed in the PD studies, some information on the pharmacodynamics 
of the BZA/CE combination may be derived from the toxicology studies. Oestrogens (but not BZA) are known to 
induce  hyperplasia  of  the  mammary  gland,  and  this  effect  was  also  observed  with  the  BZA/oestrogen 
combination in rats. Hence, BZA was not able to (fully) counteract the estrogenic effects on the breast in this 
species. The matter is not fully clear since in the 1-month study mammary hyperplasia was only observed with 
the E2/BZA combination but not with the BZA/CE combination. It is not known whether the E2 dose used was 
stronger estrogenic than the CE dose used because CE and E2 were not tested alone. In the 6-month study, 
mammary hyperplasia was most pronounced after recovery, which could indicate a sort of rebound effect. It is 
not known whether a similar rebound effect could occur in humans. Regarding the endometrium, atrophy was 
observed in the 1-month study as desired, but the 6-month study revealed squamous metaplasia of unknown 
significance. In monkeys, no hyper- or metaplasia was observed in the mammary gland or endometrium with 
Assessment report

Page 36/153 
  
  
 
 
the BZA/CE dose ratio tested. It is expected that the dose ratio of BZA and CE is critical for the resulting effects. 
A sufficiently high BZA dose is probably able to counteract all undesired effects of CE on breast and uterus, but 
the  question  remains  whether  the  desired  effects  of  CE  in  respect  to  bone  and  hot  flush  remain  largely 
unaffected under these circumstances. 
It should be noted that the dose ratio of BZA/CE used was markedly different in the PD and toxicology studies 
so that comparison of the findings is difficult. Whereas in the large rat PD study (RPT-58143) the BZA dose was 
much lower than the CE dose (per mg/kg), the opposite is true for the toxicology studies. In fact, the high BZA 
dose in the toxicity studies led to a much higher exposure (AUC) ratio of BZA vs. CE (measured as estrone) in 
the steady state in animals than in humans (the ratio was up to around 200 in mice, up to around 70 in monkeys 
and was 2 in humans). Thus, the anti-estrogenic effect of BZA addition to CE was considerably overestimated in 
the toxicity studies. It can be expected that much more pronounced proliferation of mammary gland tissue and 
perhaps  also  proliferation  of  the  endometrium  would  have  been  observed  if the  BZA  dose  would  have  been 
reduced to around one hundredth in rats to match the human therapeutic exposure ratio. It would have been 
desirable to see PD and toxicology data (including histopathology and proliferation markers) with the same BZA 
and CE doses leading to a similar exposure ratio as observed in humans. The Applicant explained that dose 
selection in the PD studies was based on the different sensitivity of humans and rodents towards oestrogens. On 
the  other  hand,  dose  selection  in  the  toxicology  studies  was  only  based  on  exposure  multiples.  However,  if 
different sensitivity is known, this should also be regarded when selecting the doses for the toxicology studies. 
Thus, the new information that can be derived from the BZA/CE combination studies in rodents remains limited.  
No other toxicology studies were performed but the toxicology programme is considered sufficient for a fixed 
combination of known authorised substances. Performing repeated dose studies of rather long duration in two 
species is justified by the fact that BZA and CE are not used as free combination so that clinical experience with 
the combination is lacking. 
Ecotoxicity / Environmental Risk Assessment 
The Environmental Risk Assessment of bazedoxifene and estrone / 17β-dihydroequilin cannot be concluded until 
the  Applicant  will  provide  the  missing  data  and  the  revised  ERA.  It  was  agreed  that  this  will  be  done 
post-authorisation by 31 March 2015.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The Applicant submitted pharmacodynamic studies in vitro and in vivo, aiming to demonstrate that (rather low) 
doses of BZA added to CE do not affect the desired effects of CE in models of hot flush and osteoporosis. On the 
other  hand,  it  should  be  demonstrated  that  the  undesired  (proliferative)  effects  of  CE  on  the  uterus  and 
mammary gland can be blocked by addition of BZA. However, it could not be shown that BZA at a suitable dose 
leaves the desired CE effects completely unaffected but fully blocks the undesired effects. Proliferative effects of 
the BZA/CE combination on bone and uterus were not investigated with appropriate methods so that no firm 
conclusions  can  be  drawn,  e.g.  no  histology  was  performed  and  no  proliferation  markers  were  determined. 
Although  histology  data  are  available  from  toxicology  studies,  comparison  is  not  possible  because  in  the 
toxicology studies much more BZA was administered compared to CE than in the PD studies. This approach is 
questionable because thereby no toxicological information is available for BZA/CE ratios for which the desired 
bone effect was demonstrated.  By increasing the BZA dose as done in the toxicology studies a rather complete 
inhibition  of  mammary  gland  and  endometrium  proliferation  is  easily  to  achieve  but  the  effect  on  bone  is 
questionable and was not tested in the toxicology studies. Vice versa, the dose ratio BZA/CE used in the PD

study supports the desired bone effects but could lead to mammary or endometrial proliferation which was not 
sufficiently tested in these studies. Clarkson has addressed this in a report from 2012 compiled of publications 
(published  or  intended  for  publication),  where  the  effect  of  bazedoxifene  acetate  and  conjugated  equine 
oestrogens  administrated  alone  and  in  combination  on  coronary  artery  atherosclerosis,  bone  and 
breast/endometrial  health  of  surgically  postmenopausal  monkeys.  Whereas  the  described  effects  on  bone, 
endometrium and coronary arteries gave no cause for concern, it appeared as if addition of CE increases cell 
proliferation in the mammary gland. Thus, the effect of BZA/CE in regard to breast cancer remains uncertain; an 
increased proliferation due to addition of CE to BZA cannot be excluded. 
Ecotoxicity / Environmental Risk Assessment 
The assessment of the environmental risk of both bazedoxifene and estrone / 17â-dihydroequilin (conjugated 
oestrogens) cannot be completed. The Applicant committed to provide missing data, study reports as well as a 
revised ERA by end of first quarter 2015.

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The  clinical  trials  were  performed  in  accordance  with  GCP  as  claimed  by  the  Applicant.  The  Applicant  has 
provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the  community  were  carried  out  in 
accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
The CHMP was of the view that GCP inspections should be triggered for at least one of the pivotal trials for each 
part of the applied indication, i.e. treatment of oestrogen deficiency symptoms and treatment of osteoporosis. 
In addition, a GCP inspection of the bioanalytical site was recommended in the context of the analysis of the 
oestrogen plasma levels (free and total) as both the performance of study sample analysis and the in-study 
validation are considered insufficient.  
Therefore a request for GCP inspection was adopted by the CHMP in November 2012 for: 
-  the bioanalytical part of the pivotal studies 3115A1-1139-US and 3115A1-1142-US, as well as at: 
-  for study 303 (study centres that enrolled 889 and 307 subjects) and 
-  for study 305 (study centre that enrolled 26 subjects) 
in order to provide further product specific information.  
The Applicant conducted a routine GCP investigator site auditing programme. In 2010 the Applicant reviewed 
the outcome of these Sponsor conducted audits and engaged a third party to conduct post-study investigator 
site assessments of the Phase 3 studies that had been completed at that time. The third-party GCP assessments 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/383987/2014 
Page 38/153 
  
  
 
 
 
were conducted from January through June 2011 and encompassed Studies 303, 304, 305, and 306. Study 
3307  was  ongoing  at  that  time  with  no  critical  issues  reported  from  GCP  audits.  Fifty-three  (53)  clinical 
investigator sites, representing 18% of the total of 293 sites were audited; site selection was determined using 
a statistical sampling approach, taking into account geographical distribution of sites and review of risk factors 
including adverse event rates, screen failure rates, subject discontinuations, and subject completer rates. This 
third party GCP assessment did not identify any significant systemic findings.  
EMA GCP inspection of study 303 and study 305 
The inspected investigator sites 447 and 450 of trial 303 contributed 889 and 307, respectively, out of 3,544 
subjects,  about  35% of  the  total  trial  population.  Thus  the  inspection  findings  from  these  sites  have  a  high 
relevance for the acceptability of the entire study data of trial 303. The missing source data for 197 subjects 
from sites 447 and 450 and 3 other sites denote a major concern as the validity of the study data is considered 
corrupted. This is further aggravated by the Sponsor not having an adequate overview of the trial conduct at the 
two sites i.e. about serious non-compliances. The available archived source data at the two investigator sites 
were under the sole control of the Sponsor. With regard to endometrial safety, the results of the GCP inspection 
of the two sites of study 303 and of the Sponsor inspection referring to the study conduct in general and more 
specifically to handling of endometrial biopsies are relevant. It is noted that the biopsies were sent from the 
clinical sites to the Sponsor and then to the pathologists. The reports of the pathologists were sent from the 
pathologist to the Sponsor and then to the clinical site. Thus, all biopsies as well as all reports from pathologists 
were in the possession of the Sponsor. This is not acceptable. Taking into account further critical and major 
findings related to study conduct and reporting it is agreed with the Inspectors that data from this study cannot 
be used to demonstrate the endometrial safety of BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg and BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg.  
The  second  study  investigating  endometrial  safety  in  terms  of  incidence  of  hyperplasia  /  malignancy  at  12 
months was study 3307. No GCP inspection with regard to this study was performed by European inspectors, but 
further clarification as regards the handling of endometrial biopsies in this study was provided from the Applicant. 
The CHMP agreed that a GCP inspection of this study is not considered necessary. 
With regard to the demonstration of efficacy of BZA/CE in the treatment of hot flushes, study 305 is pivotal. As 
a result of the GCP inspection, this study was also classified as not GCP-compliant. Nevertheless, the analyses 
regarding  hot  flushes  described  in  the  study  report  are  considered  valid  and  are  taken  into  account  for  the 
assessment of efficacy.  
As regards adverse events relatedness to study medication was incorrectly assessed by the investigators of the 
two  sites  from  study  303  and  the  data  of  the  clinical  study  report  on  the  basis  of  these  assessments  are 
incorrect; the assessment was clearly shifted to ‘not related’. Considering that comparable findings occurred for 
the investigator site inspection of trial 305, the deficiencies as regards adverse event reporting seem to be a 
systematic deficiency, not involving only the two sites from study 303. There were also concerns in relation to 
the quality of safety data reported in relation to the adverse event ‘hypertension’ and ‘adverse event related 
subjects’ withdrawal’. The Sponsor’s re-monitoring at sites 447 and 450 did not remedy the systematic failures 
in relation to adverse event reporting. Measures at the Sponsor site to ensure quality in the evaluation of the 
safety profile for the product were also not sufficient. The CHMP agreed with the Inspectors that at this stage it 
is not realistically possible to remedy this finding. The findings are considered relevant for the benefit / risk 
assessment, since the study 303 data cannot be  used to demonstrate the endometrial safety and adequate 
Assessment report

Page 39/153 
  
  
 
 
 
validity of the adverse event reporting has not been shown. Despite this limitation the analyses regarding hot 
flushes are considered valid and were taken into account for the assessment of efficacy. 
EMA GCP inspections of bioanalytical site  
The GCP inspection of the bioanalytical site was focused on the verification of the bioanalytical data reported in 
the  Marketing  Authorisation  Application  for  the  pivotal  studies  3115A1-1139-US  and  3115A1-1142-US.  The 
inspection revealed 2 major and 1 minor GCP finding. The two major findings observed were related to the 
method validation for the determination of the oestrogens; only within run, but no between-run precision and 
accuracy was tested for LLOQ. A possible matrix effect for haemolysed and hyperlipidaemic samples was not 
investigated.  Selectivity  Testing  was  only  performed  with  plasma  from  two  different  individuals.  Long  Term 
Stability data and data for Stock Solution stability were provided only post inspection. The stability data and 
documentation provided (investigations from 1995 / 1996 and 2001) were considered not acceptable to reflect 
the  technical,  scientific,  and  documentary  standards  valid  for  the  trials  performed  in  2008  and  2009  at  the 
inspected laboratory (Finding MA1). The matrix effect was not tested although the composition of the plasma for 
the  blank  samples  (obtained  by  aphaeresis)  differed  (different  dilution  and  Na-Heparin  content)  from  the 
composition of the subject plasmas in the two inspected trials (obtained by a vacutainer system) (Finding MA2). 
Due to these findings the validity of the bioanalytical method could not be concluded and thus these findings 
were  considered  relevant  for  the  benefit  /  risk  assessment.  In  course  of  the  GCP  inspection  procedure  the 
Applicant was requested to address these findings by submission of additional supporting validation test results. 
The results of these investigations have been provided after close of the GCP inspection and were considered 
sufficient to address the GCP major findings. There was one outstanding point for clarification regarding the 
between-run  precision  and  accuracy  at  LLOQ 
for  17β-Dihydroequilin,  17β-Δ8,9 Dehydroestradiol, 
Δ8,9 Dehydroestrone, and Equilin which has been adequately addressed.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
General PK 
The PK of BZA is well investigated as shown in the SmPC and EPAR of bazedoxifene. The submission of the 
dossier  for  DUAVIVE  does  not  provide  relevant  new  data  except  the  newly  submitted  interaction  studies 
3115A1-1134-US and -1135-US. The new information is that bazedoxifene co-administered with Premarin have 
no effect on PK of BZA and CE (and vice versa) so that the effects seen in study 3115A1-101-US seems to be an 
effect of the formulation of the fixed combination product, in this case and in concrete Formulation A. 
The  PK  of  CE  is  well  established  (see  SmPC  of  CE  containing  products  approved  nationally  within  the  EU 
[Premarin in most countries, Climopax in Germany]). The Applicant submitted a comprehensive overview on PK 
data of CE monotherapy summarising the available study data and literature. 
Bioequivalence 
Four (4) main bioequivalence studies in fasted state were performed comparing the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg 
and the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg to-be-marketed formulations to clinical formulations A and B which were used 
in several clinical studies including phase III. For the 2 initially proposed strengths, the 80-125% acceptance 
ranges for bioequivalence for BZA and the analysed total, i.e. conjugated and unconjugated, oestrogens (i.e. 
total  estrone,  estrone  adjusted  for  baseline,  equilin,  17β-estradiol,  17β-estradiol  adjusted  for  baseline, 
Δ-dehydroestrone, 17β-Δ-dehydroestradiol) were met. 
However, the active substance CE is an extract from mare´s urine and thus a biological product containing a not 
fully characterised mixture of about 160 components. Currently there appears to be no regulatory experience 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/383987/2014

within  the  EU  regarding  the  investigation  of  bioequivalence  of  CE-containing  formulations.  Proof  of 
bioequivalence between the formulation of BZA/CE used in the clinical studies and the TBM formulation is critical 
for  this  application.  Therefore  the  Pharmacokinetics  working  party  (PKWP)  was  involved  with  regard  to  the 
concept and methodological issues regarding proof of bioequivalence regarding CE. The PKWP agreed that the 
concept to demonstrate bioequivalence with respect to the active substance “conjugated oestrogens” based on 
2  lead  substances,  i.e.  estrone  and  equilin,  is  acceptable.  It  was  also  agreed  that  bioequivalence  should  be 
demonstrated with respect to total (conjugated and unconjugated) oestrogens and that demonstration of BE 
with respect to free (unconjugated) oestrogens is not required (for details see Section 1, Questions to be posed 
to additional experts above). 
Based  on  results  of  a  food-effect  programme  for  the  mono-components  and  the  combination  product  Cmax 
increases up to 44% and AUC up to 25% for BZA single dose and steady state. For CE both Cmax and AUC differed 
(decreased or increased) up to 22%. It is agreed with the MAH that even though one of the food-effect studies 
with the combination product used a formulation not bioequivalent with the TBM product, the results are in line 
with previous food-effect studies supporting the overall effect of food on the BZA/CE formulation. In addition, 
the pivotal studies (conducted with formulations bioequivalent to the TBM formulation) mimicked the real-life 
situation as no specific recommendations were given regarding administration with or without food. It should be 
noted that the food-effect studies have only been conducted with the 20 mg BZA / 0.625 mg CE combination. 
With  regards  to  the  CE  components  no  safety  issues  are  expected  as  the  other  suggested  dosage  includes 
0.45 mg of CE thus a smaller dose than investigated in the food-effect studies. With regard to BZA 20 mg / CE 
0.45 mg intake with food is not expected to result in lack of effect of the CE component as that the ratio of fed 
state to fasting state for AUCT and AUCinf were 0.87-1.06 for estrone (total and unconjugated estrone; adjusted 
and unadjusted) and 0.85-1.06 for equilin, supporting that food does not alter the exposure in clinically relevant 
ways. 
Bioanalytical methods for CE 
With  regard  to  the  bioanalytical  methods  used  for  the  determination  of  total  and  free  oestrogens,  the 
bioanalytical method for the determination of the free (unconjugated) oestrogens is not considered valid. Only 
the  determination  of  the  total  (conjugated  and  unconjugated)  oestrogens  can  be  accepted  as  valid,  which 
however is considered sufficient. The justification for basing the decision with respect to bioequivalence on total 
oestrogens  only  is  that  these  are  considered  as  sensitive  with  respect  to  detection  of  formulation-specific 
differences and that AUC of total oestrogens seems to reflect the amount of oestrogens absorbed from the tablet 
formulation. 
Furthermore, there was one remaining other concern. The shelf life / retest period of almost all of the reference 
standards used for the bioanalytical determination of oestrogens (free and total) in the study plasma samples 
was  expired  prior  to  study  sample  analysis.  Furthermore,  characterization  /  identification  of  the  working 
reference standards has not been described for most of the reference standards. However, these issues have 
been adequately resolved now.  
As  mentioned  in  section  2.4  above  two  GCP  major  findings  related  to  the  method  validation  for  the 
determination of the oestrogens were identified during the GCP inspection of the bioanalytical site inVentiv, 
Princeton,  New  Jersey,  USA.  In  the  course  of  the  GCP  inspection  procedure  the  Applicant  was  requested  to 
address  these  findings  by  submission  of  additional  supporting  validation  test  results.  The  results  of  these 
investigations have been provided after close of the GCP inspection and were considered sufficient to address 
the  GCP  major  findings.  One  outstanding  point  for  clarification  regarding  the  between-run  precision  and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/383987/2014

accuracy  at  LLOQ  for  17β-Dihydroequilin,  17β-Δ  Dehydroestradiol,  Δ Dehydroestrone,  and  Equilin  was  later 
adequately addressed by the Applicant.  
Conclusion regarding bioequivalence 
In conclusion, bioequivalence of the formulations administered in the clinical studies and the TBM formulation 
was adequately demonstrated. No relevant effect of intake with food compared to intake in the fasting state on 
the bioavailability of CE and BZA is expected.  
Absorption  
After  a  single  dose  of  BZA/CE,  BZA,  and  baseline-adjusted  total  estrone  were  absorbed  with  a  t max  of 
approximately  2 hours  and  8.5 hours,  respectively.  When  single  doses  of  CE  0.625 mg  /  BZA  20 mg  were 
administered with a high-fat meal, BZA Cmax was unaffected, but AUC increased by approximately 25%. Food 
had little or no effect on the exposure of conjugated oestrogens. BZA/CE can be administered with or without 
food. 
Following administration of BZA alone, a linear increase in plasma concentrations for single doses from 0.5 mg 
up to 120 mg and multiple daily doses from 1 mg to 80 mg was observed. The absolute bioavailability of BZA is 
approximately 6%. Conjugated oestrogens are soluble in water and are well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal 
tract after release from the medicinal product formulation. Oestrogen dose proportionality was assessed in two 
studies of CE. Dose-proportional increases in both AUC and Cmax were observed across the dose range from 
0.3 mg to 0.625 mg of CE for total (conjugated plus unconjugated) equilin, total estrone adjusted for baseline, 
and unconjugated estrone adjusted for baseline. 
Distribution 
The  distribution  of  CE  and  BZA  after  administration  of  BZA/CE  has  not  been  studied.  Following  intravenous 
administration of a 3 mg dose of BZA alone, the volume of distribution is 14.7 ± 3.9 l/kg. BZA is highly bound 
(98%-99%)  to  plasma  proteins  in  vitro,  but  does  not  bind  to  sex  hormone  binding  globulin  (SHBG).  The 
distribution  of  exogenous  oestrogens  is  similar  to  that  of  endogenous  oestrogens.  Oestrogens  are  widely 
distributed in  the  body  and  are  generally  found  in  higher  concentrations  in  the  sex  hormone  target  organs. 
Oestrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to SHBG and albumin. 
Metabolism and Elimination 
The  metabolic  disposition  of  CE  and  BZA,  after  administration  of  BZA/CE,  has  not  been  studied.  Exogenous 
oestrogens are metabolised in the same manner as endogenous oestrogens. Circulating oestrogens exist in a 
dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions. 17β-estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone, and both 
can be converted to estriol, which is the major urinary metabolite. In postmenopausal women, a significant 
proportion of the circulating oestrogens exists as sulfate conjugates, especially estrone sulfate, which serves as 
a  circulating  reservoir  for  the  formation  of  more  active  oestrogens.  The  metabolic  disposition  of  BZA  in 
postmenopausal women has been determined following oral administration of 20 mg of radiolabeled BZA. BZA 
is extensively metabolised in women. Glucuronidation is the major metabolic pathway. Little or no cytochrome 
P450-mediated  metabolism  is  evident.  BZA-5-glucuronide  is  the  major  circulating  metabolite.  The 
concentrations of these glucuronides are approximately 10-fold higher than those of unchanged BZA in plasma. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/383987/2014 
Page 46/153 
  
  
 
 
After  a  single  dose  of  BZA/CE,  baseline-adjusted  total  estrone  (representing  conjugated  oestrogens)  is 
eliminated  with  a  half-life  of  approximately  17 hours.  BZA  is  eliminated  with  a  half-life  of  approximately 
30 hours.  Steady-state  concentrations  are  achieved  by  the  second  week  of  once-daily  administration. 
Conjugated oestrogens components, 17β-estradiol, estrone, and estriol are excreted in the urine along with 
glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. The clearance of BZA is 0.4 ± 0.1 L/h/kg based on IV administration. The 
major route of excretion of radiolabeled BZA is the faeces and less than 1% of the dose is eliminated in urine. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Following administration of BZA alone, a linear increase in plasma concentrations for single doses from 0.5 mg 
up to 120 mg, and multiple daily doses from 1 mg to 80 mg was observed. 
CE  are  soluble  in  water  and  are  well-absorbed  from  the  gastrointestinal  tract  after  release  from  the  drug 
formulation. Oestrogen dose proportionality was assessed in two studies of CE. Dose-proportional increases in 
both AUC and Cmax were observed across the dose range from 0.3 mg to 0.625 mg of CE for total (conjugated 
plus unconjugated) equilin, total estrone adjusted for baseline, and unconjugated estrone adjusted for baseline. 
A drug will exhibit time independent PK when single-dose PK data accurately predicts the PK data observed 
following multiple doses. Specifically, the exposure (AUC) observed over the dosing interval once the drug has 
achieved steady state systemic concentrations following multiple dosing (AUCss) should be similar to the AUCinf 
observed following a single dose of the drug.   
Special populations 
Elderly 
The pharmacokinetics of BZA/CE have not been evaluated in women over 75 years of age. The PK of a 20 mg 
single-dose of BZA were evaluated in a study in 26 healthy postmenopausal women. On average, compared to 
women 51 to 64 years of age (n=8), women 65 to 74 years of age (n=8) showed a 1.5-fold increase in AUC and 
women >75 years of age (n=8) showed a 2.6-fold increase in AUC. This increase is most likely attributable to 
age-related changes in hepatic function.  
Renal impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of BZA/CE have not been evaluated in patients with renal impairment. Limited clinical 
impairment  (creatinine 
data  (n=5) 
clearance < 50 ml/min).  A  single  20 mg  dose  of  BZA  was  administered  to  these  subjects.  Negligible  (<1%) 
in  subjects  with  moderate 
for  BZA  are  available 
renal 
amounts of BZA are eliminated in urine. Impaired renal function showed little or no influence on bazedoxifene 
pharmacokinetics. 
Hepatic impairment  
The pharmacokinetics of BZA/CE have not been evaluated in women with hepatic impairment. The disposition of 
a single 20 mg dose of BZA was compared in women with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A [n=6], B 
[n=6],  and  C  [n=6])  and  subjects  with  normal  hepatic  function  (n=18).  On  average,  women  with  hepatic 
impairment  showed  a  4.3-fold  increase  in  AUC  compared  with  controls.  Safety  and  efficacy  have  not  been 
evaluated further in women with hepatic insufficiency. Use of BZA/CE in this population is contraindicated. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/383987/2014 
Page 47/153 
  
  
 
 
Gender 
Pharmacokinetics were investigated in postmenopausal women so that a gender effect cannot be assessed. 
Race 
The clearance of BZA was not appreciably different among the different race groups (Asian, Black, Hispanic, 
White).  Population  pharmacokinetic  analyses  showed  no  significant  effect  of  ethnic  origin  on  CL/F  or  V/F.  A 
similar analysis of baseline-adjusted total estrone oral clearance versus ethnic origin based on BZA/CE studies 
proved that there is no difference in the oral clearance across these groups. 
Weight 
No evidence of an effect of body weight on the pharmacokinetics (clearance) of BZA was found in the clinical 
programme  investigating  monotherapy.  The  same  applies  to  trials  performed  with  the  BZA/CE  fixed 
combination. The same applies on estrone. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No interaction studies have been performed with BZA/CE fixed combination. However, the interactions of the 
components  of  DUAVIVE  with  one  another  have  been  investigated.  Two  (2)  more  recent  trials  allow  the 
conclusion  that  the  impact  of  BZA  on  CE  PK  and  vice  versa  is  minor  and  clinically  irrelevant.  Based  on  this 
conclusion it is not very likely that the fixed combination will interact with other substances (and vice versa) 
differently than its single components. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
BZA/CE  pairs  conjugated  oestrogens  (CE)  with  the  selective  oestrogen  receptor  modulator  (SERM), 
bazedoxifene. The active ingredients of CE are primarily the sulphate esters of estrone, equilin sulphates and 
17α/β-estradiol.  These  substitute  for  the  loss  of  oestrogen  production  in  menopausal  women,  and  alleviate 
menopausal  symptoms.  As  oestrogens  promote  the  growth  of  the  endometrium,  unopposed  oestrogens 
increase  the  risk  of  endometrial  hyperplasia  and  cancer.  The  addition  of  bazedoxifene  reduces  the 
oestrogen-induced risk of endometrial hyperplasia in non-hysterectomised women. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of this fixed dose combination of CE and BZA have mainly been described by 
referring to the PD properties of both active substances. The PD properties for bazedoxifene monotherapy have 
been described and are available from the EPAR of bazedoxifene. With regard to the PD properties of the CE, the 
Applicant  submitted  a  comprehensive  overview  of  monotherapy  summarising  the  available  study  data  and 
literature. 
The pharmacodynamics of various biomarkers seen with the treatment of BZA as monotherapy was evaluated in 
a multiple ascending dose study (3068A1-101-US).  
No sign of QTc prolongation was seen when subjects were treated with BZA alone in the moxifloxacin controlled 
study 3068A1-131-US. With regard to CE, there are no indications of QTc prolongation in the literature or in 
Assessment report

PSURS for CE products. In studies investigating BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg and BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg there 
was also no evidence of QTc prolongation based on ECG findings.  
For the fixed dose combination the Applicant has provided results of a population PD model based on data from 
Phase 2 trial 203 as well as from Phase 3 trials 300 (BZA mono), 303, and 304 together with historical data from 
the  HOPE  trial  for  CE  (Utian  WH  et  al.,  2001).  The  model  includes  data  for  the  key  PD  endpoints  rate  of 
endometrial hyperplasia and changes in BMD evaluated in Phase 3 trials. Overall, the population PK/PD model 
development,  except  of  the  data  handling  regarding  the  handling  of  outliers  and  the  splitting  into  different 
datasets, seems adequate. Results of the model indicate that for a CE dose of 0.45 mg BZA AUC values of less 
than 10 μg/L*h were associated with a risk of hyperplasia that was greater than 1%. For a CE dose of 0.625 mg 
BZA AUC values of less than 30 μg/L*h were associated with a risk of hyperplasia that was greater than 1%. 
Subjects  receiving  BZA  from  formulation  C  had  lower  AUC  values  and  therefore  a  higher  probability  of 
hyperplasia  than  subjects  receiving  the  same  40 mg  dose  with  formulation  A  due  to  the  reduced  relative 
bioavailability of BZA from this formulation. The model based evaluation of spine and hip BMD suggests an effect 
of BZA in reducing the progression of BMD loss. For the spine BMD model the effect of BZA dose was found to be 
important  but  differences  in  exposure  due  to  formulation  are  unlikely  to  have  been  noted  due  to  the  short 
duration of therapy. Over longer treatment intervals, however, the efficacy of formulation C would be expected 
to be less than formulation A. 
Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials used PD effects as primary and secondary endpoints. The available data indicate that 
there is a relevant PD interaction between the two active substances CE and BZA. For the prevention of hot 
flushes the lowest dose of CE of 0.3 mg (e.g. SPC Climopax in DE; Utian WH et al., 2001) effective in hormone 
replacement therapy (HRT) was not effective to prevent hot flushes in the fixed combination of CE with BZA. As 
regards bone mineral density (BMD) while in BZA monotherapy programme (Study 300) 20 mg BZA was more 
effective on BMD than 10 mg, the effect on BMD appears to be most pronounced with the fixed combination of 
BZA/CE containing 10 mg of BZA and attenuating with increasing doses of BZA. As regards genetic differences 
in  PD  response  no  significant  differences  in  exposure  and  subsequent  differences  in  response  due  to  poor 
metaboliser status of one of the metabolizing enzymes is to be expected. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics of BZA have been well investigated and the current submission does not provide relevant new 
data  except  for  the  newly  submitted  interaction  studies  3115A1-1134-US  and  -1135-US.  Conbriza 
co-administered with Premarin has no effect on PK of BZA and CE and vice versa; the effects seen in Study 
3115A1-101-US seem to be due to the formulation. The known food effect of BZA has been confirmed for the 
combination.  Pharmacokinetics  of  CE  are  also  well  established  and  a  comprehensive  overview  was  provided 
within this procedure.  
As regards the bioequivalence studies provided for the 2 proposed dose strengths the 80-125%-acceptance 
ranges for bioequivalence for BZA and the analysed CE were met. However, the active substance CE is an extract 
from  mare´s  urine  and  thus  a  biological  product  containing  a  not  fully  characterised  mixture  of  about  160 
components. The CHMP noted that there was no regulatory experience within the EU regarding the investigation 
of bioequivalence of CE-containing formulations. However, proof of bioequivalence between the formulation of 
BZA/CE  used  in  the  clinical  studies  and  the  TBM  formulation  was  considered  critical  for  this  application. 
Therefore, the PKWP was asked to provide a response to two questions.

CHMP questions to PKWP  
Is  it  an  acceptable  approach  to  demonstrate  bioequivalence  of  conjugated  oestrogens  based  on  two  “lead 
substances”, i.e. the most abundant components estrone and equilin? 
Summary of the PKWP Response 
Based on Ph.Eur monograph, CE is considered an active substance consisting of 169 components (based on 
observed HPLC-MS analysis). The Ph.Eur monograph states 10 components to represent >91.5 % by mass of 
overall CE. Accordingly, based on specifications possible content variability is limited. The potency for any given 
dose strength of CE monotherapy is based on the 3 most abundant components estrone, equilin, and sodium 
17alpha-dihydroequilin. Taking the mean percentage, estrone and equilin represent 83.5 %, i.e. more than 80% 
of  the  administered  dose.  The  components  used  for  bioequivalence  evaluation  were  selected  based  on  a 
pragmatic approach, i.e. those having a large quantity of the mixture and were quantifiable in plasma samples 
hence  allowing  calculation  of  relevant  PK  parameter  (AUC  and  Cmax)  for  bioequivalence  decision.  Based  on 
currently available data it does not seem feasible to identify components that are most relevant with respect to 
the  pharmacodynamic  /  clinical  response.  Oestrogens  from  CE  are  eliminated  in  near-parallel  fashion  with 
terminal half-lives generally ranging from 10 to 20 hours. For the purpose of bioequivalence only pre-specified 
compounds should be quantified that have been judged most relevant for the comparison of formulations.  
In  conclusion,  the  bioequivalence  approach  employed  for  the  most  abundant  (‘lead’)  CE  components  is 
considered pragmatic but reasonable. This is supported by data that shows that baseline adjusted total estrone 
and total equilin appear to translate formulation-related PK differences. 
Sufficiently sensitive bioanalytical methods for determination of unconjugated oestrogens are not available. Is it 
acceptable to take only total (unconjugated and conjugated) oestrogens into consideration for determination of 
bioequivalence of formulations containing conjugated oestrogens? 
Summary of the PKWP Response 
Conjugated  oestrogens  are  water-soluble  and  are  well-absorbed  from  the  gastrointestinal  tract.  However, 
bioavailability is low due to first-pass metabolism in the small intestine and liver. Following oral administration, 
many of the conjugates are hydrolysed already in the mucosa of the stomach and the small intestine; however, 
the  unconjugated  oestrogens  are  quickly  re-conjugated  in  the  liver  following  absorption.  Furthermore, 
exogenous  oestrogens  are  reported  to  be  metabolised  in  the  same  manner  as  endogenous  oestrogens. 
Published  data  indicate  that  complex  metabolic  processes  result  in  a  dynamic  equilibrium  of  circulating 
conjugated and unconjugated estrogenic forms. From biopharmaceutics perspective the Applicant’s position is 
agreed that it is reasonable to base bioequivalence decisions on total rather than unconjugated oestrogens since 
the tablets contain predominantly sulphated conjugates of oestrogens. Conjugates may thus be considered the 
‘parent compound’. The unconjugated oestrogens are available in plasma in rather small amounts. Moreover, it 
has been demonstrated that total oestrogens (baseline adjusted) could identify formulation related differences 
in bioavailability. However, some limitations are expected regarding rate parameter of total oestrogens since 
they may not describe pure absorption but include biotransformation processes.  
In conclusion, the PKWP agreed that the concept using lead substances for demonstration of bioequivalence for 
the active substance “conjugated oestrogens” which is a mixture of numerous known und some unknown 
substances is acceptable. In addition, the PKWP agreed that BE can be demonstrated with respect to total

(conjugated and unconjugated) oestrogens. For the full advice from the PKWP see Appendix 1: PKWP Responses 
to Questions posed by the CHMP. 
Based on the available PK data for the mono-components as well as the combination product and taking also into 
account that in the pivotal studies no specific recommendations were given regarding administration with or 
without food, a clinically relevant food effect on BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg is not expected. It should be noted 
that the food-effect studies have only been conducted with the 20 mg BZA / 0.625 mg CE combination. With 
regard to BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg, intake with food is not expected to decrease the effect of the CE component, 
based on the ratio of fed to fasting state of AUCT and AUCinf for estrone and equilin. 
PD properties of this FDC of CE and BZA have mainly been described by referring to the PD properties of both 
active substances. The PD properties for BZA monotherapy have been described and are available from the 
EPAR of BZA. A description and discussion on the PD properties of CE has been provided within current dossier.  
For the FDC the Applicant has provided results of a population PD model. Overall, the model development seems 
adequate. The model based evaluation of spine and hip BMD suggests an effect of BZA in reducing the 
progression of BMD loss. For the spine BMD model the effect of BZA dose was found to be important, but 
differences in exposure due to formulation are unlikely to have been noted due to the short duration of therapy. 
Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials used PD effects as primary and secondary endpoints and the available data indicate 
that the effects of CE decrease when CE is combined with increasing doses of BZA with regard to hot flushes as 
well as effects on endometrium. As regards genetic differences in PD response no significant differences in 
exposure and subsequent differences in response due to poor metaboliser status of one of the metabolising 
enzymes is to be expected. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In summary, due to the lack of pharmacokinetic interaction of BZA on CE and vice versa, PK statements for the 
proposed  BZA/CE  SmPC  can  be  based  on  the  SmPC  of  Conbriza  and  Premarin  and  related trade  names.  As 
regards bioequivalence the 80-125%-acceptance range for bioequivalence was met for BZA and the measured 
CEs  for  the  2  initial  proposed  tablet  strengths  used  in  the  provided  studies  vs.  the  TBM  formulation.  Thus, 
bioequivalence was adequately demonstrated. No relevant effect of intake with food compared to intake in the 
fasting state on the bioavailability of CE and BZA is expected.  
The  PD  properties  of  BZA/CE  have  mainly  been  described  by  referring  to  the  PD  properties  of  both  active 
substances. The Applicant has also provided results of a population PD model; the model based evaluation of 
spine and hip BMD suggests an effect of BZA in reducing the progression of BMD loss. For the spine BMD model 
the effect of BZA dose was found to be important, but differences in exposure due to formulation are unlikely to 
have been noted due to the short duration of therapy. Furthermore, the available data indicate that with regards 
to hot flushes as well as endometrium the effects of CE decrease when CE is combined with increasing doses of 
BZA.  As  regards  genetic  differences  in  PD  response  no  significant  differences  in  exposure  and  subsequent 
differences in response due to poor metaboliser status of one of the metabolising enzymes is to be expected.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The BZA/CE clinical development programme consists of data summarised from 26 clinical trials, 20 Phase 1, 1 
Phase 2, and 5 Phase 3 studies, of which 4 are considered pivotal.  
The Phase 1 programme assessed the pharmacokinetics of BZA/CE in generally healthy postmenopausal women 
and consisted mainly of bioavailability/bioequivalence, food effect, and drug interaction studies.  
Study 203 was the only Phase 2 trial; doses of 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg for BZA and 0.3 mg and 0.625 mg for 
CE were investigated. Based on these data, the Applicant considered the 0.3 mg CE dose not to be effective for 
the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and vulvar and vaginal atrophy symptoms 
(VVA). 
The BZA/CE Phase 3 programme comprised the 5 studies 303, 304, 305, 306, and 3307; as for the tablets used 
during trial 304 bioequivalence to the finally to be marketed medicinal product could not be established, data 
from this trial are considered supportive only. In all these trials BZA/CE was administered as a single tablet in 
contrast to the Phase 2 dose ranging study. As the dose of 0.3 mg CE was not considered effective based on 
Study 203, the Applicant choose a dose of 0.45 mg CE as lowest dose in the Phase 3 programme; this dose was 
identified as effective to treat moderate to severe VMS in the Women’s Health Osteoporosis Progestin Estrogen 
(HOPE) Study (Utian et al., 2001) and investigated this together with a dose of 0.625 mg CE. The Applicant 
considers the availability of 2 dose strengths of CE in the FDC of BZA/CE consistent with current treatment 
guidelines for HRT (North American Menopause Society, 2012; Sturdee DW et al., 2011; Climacteric medicine: 
European  Menopause  and  Andropause  Society  (EMAS)  2004/2005  position  statements  on  peri-  and 
postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy, 2005) by allowing healthcare providers to tailor the dose to a 
woman’s individual needs and to treat women with the lowest dose effective for their symptoms, as well as to 
modify the dose according to response to treatment. The doses of BZA in the first Phase 3 study 303 were 10 mg, 
20 mg, and 40 mg. 
The clinical development programme was initiated in 2001, in accordance with regulatory guidelines that were 
in effect at that time ([1]FDA HRT Working Group; Guidance for Industry: Clinical evaluation of combination 
estrogen  /  progestin-containing  drug  products  used  for  hormone  replacement  therapy  of  postmenopausal 
women. Mar 1995; [2] Division of Reproductive and Urologic Drug Products, United States Department of Health

deficiency  symptoms  in  postmenopausal  women  (EMEA/CHMP/021/97  rev.  1),  Oct  2005).  The  last  Phase  3 
study 3307 was finalised in 2011. 
As  regards  osteoporosis  the  fixed  combination  was  initially  developed  for  the  prevention  of  osteoporosis  in 
postmenopausal  women  in  accordance  with  the  CHMP  Note  for  guidance  in  effect  in  2001  (CHMP  Note  for 
guidance on postmenopausal osteoporosis in women, Jan 2001 (CPMP/EWP/552/95 rev 1)). During the clinical 
development  of  BZA/CE  the  CHMP  guideline  on  primary  osteoporosis  was  revised  (CHMP  Guideline  on  the 
Evaluation of Medicinal Products in the Treatment of Primary Osteoporosis, November 2006 (CPMP/EWP/552/95 
Rev 2, Effective 31 May 2007)); only an indication for the “treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women 
at  increased  risk  of  fracture”  should  now  generally  be  considered.  However,  prevention  is  merged  into  the 
treatment  indication,  since  the  goal  of  therapy  is  to  prevent  fractures.  The  current  guideline  accepts  under 
defined circumstances that for compounds having demonstrated anti-fracture efficacy for a specific formulation, 
demonstration of non-inferiority for changes in BMD in a study of a minimum of 1 year duration may be an 
acceptable surrogate marker for applying for an extension of the indication for a new formulation. The Applicant 
acknowledged that this approach does not directly apply to the new proposed fixed combination, but argues that 
given the similarity of the pharmacologic activity of the two components, both of which have individually shown 
efficacy for reduction of fracture risk, the demonstration of comparable effects on changes in BMD and other 
surrogate  endpoints  associated  with  fracture  risk,  such  as  bone  turnover  markers  (BTMs),  supports  the 
indication for treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women for BZA/CE. Implications of the revision to 
the guidance were discussed during EU national agency scientific advice consultations in 2008 and 2010.  
Per the current EU CHMP guideline for the clinical investigation of medicinal products for therapy of oestrogen 
deficiency symptoms, in postmenopausal women (EMEA/CHMP/021/97 rev. 1), Oct 2005 the most important 
symptoms guiding treatment in postmenopausal women are considered to be VMS (hot flushes).  
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Study 203 
Study 203 was a phase 2, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, controlled, dose finding study of BZA paired 
with CE on the estrogenic stimulation of the endometrium in healthy postmenopausal women conducted in the 
EU. Eleven dose groups were studied: 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg BZA each in combination with 0.45 mg CE and 
0.626 mg  CE;  0.3 mg,  0.625 mg  CE  monotherapy,  0.625 mg  CE  /  2.5 mg  MPA,  and  placebo.  Patients  were 
treated  for  12  weeks.  The  primary  efficacy  variable  was  endometrial  thickness  measured  by  transvaginal 
ultrasound (TVUS) at day 84. Secondary endpoints included change from baseline in the number of subjects 
presenting oestrogen related changes in the endometrium (glands and stroma), percent change from baseline 
in VMI, percent change from baseline in number and severity of hot flushes, and change from baseline in bone 
markers. Bleeding / spotting and breast tenderness were also investigated. 
Four  hundred  fourteen  (414)  patients  were  enrolled,  412  patients  were  randomised,  and  408  patients were 
treated.  Of  these,  397  patients  had  at  least  one  post-baseline  evaluation  of  endometrial  thickness  and 
constituted the ITT population. With regard to demographic and baseline characteristics the study groups were 
comparable. 
Endometrial thickness 
The results of comparisons between treatment groups are displayed in the following table:

Page 53/153 
  
  
 
 
Table 15: Transvaginal ultrasonography: endometrial thickness (mm) at day 84 (ITT) 
BZA 5 mg in combination with the two doses of CE did not decrease endometrial thickness compared to the 
respective dose of unopposed CE. 
The addition of BZA 10 mg to CE 0.3 mg resulted in an endometrial thickness at day 84 not statistically different 
from  0.3 mg  CE  alone  and  numerically  higher,  but  not  statistically  significantly  different  from  placebo.  The 
addition of 10 mg BZA to CE 0.625 mg resulted in an endometrial thickness at day 84 statistically significantly 
lower than with CE 0.625 mg alone, comparable to CE 0.625 mg / MPA 2.5 mg and statistically significantly 
higher compared to placebo. 
BZA 20 mg in combination with the two doses of CE led to a statistically significantly lower endometrial thickness 
at day 84 compared to the respective dose of unopposed CE. In combination with CE 0.3 mg, this dose of BZA 
led to an endometrial thickness at day 84 comparable to placebo. In combination with 0.625 mg CE this dose of 
BZA led to an endometrial thickness at day 84 numerically higher than placebo, but numerically lower than CE 
0.625 mg / MPA 2.5 mg. These differences however were not statistically significant. 
Regarding estrogenic effects in endometrial biopsies there was a considerable increase of about 20 to 25% in the 
percentage of patients with significant or marked effects from baseline to day 84 in the BZA 5 mg / CE 0.625 mg 
group and the CE 0.625 mg indicating that endometrial protection was insufficient in these groups. In all other 
BZA/CE groups and CE groups the number of patients with significant or marked effects increased by 1 or 2 from 
baseline to day 84, while in the BZA 5 mg group this number remained unchanged and in the CE/MPA group this 
number decreased from 1 to 0. However, based on the low number of patients per group, no definite conclusions 
can be drawn.

VMS 
For CE 0.3 mg the effect on hot flushes decreased with increasing doses of BZA. Efficacy on VMS seems unlikely 
with a dose of 20 mg BZA. 
For CE 0.625 mg effects on VMS decreased to some extent with BZA 10 mg compared to the BZA 5 mg while 
between  BZA  10 mg  and  BZA  20 mg,  the  effects  were  comparable.  However,  with  all  3  doses  of  BZA  the 
decrease of VMS can be considered as clinically relevant. 
VMI 
The effect on VMI decreased with increasing doses of BZA for CE 0.3 mg as well as CE 0.625 mg. In the BZA 
20 mg / CE 0.625 mg group an increase of the VMI from baseline to day 84 was still observed while the VMI did 
hardly change in this time interval in the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.3 mg group. 
Markers of bone metabolism 
Results for biochemical markers of bone metabolism were in line with known effects of BZA and CE.  
Lipid parameters 
As regards parameters of lipid metabolism there was no clear dose-relationship. 
Coagulation parameters 
While BZA 10 mg / CE 0.625 mg and BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg showed a statistically significant reduction from 
baseline  in  fibrinogen  levels  compared  to  placebo,  BZA/CE  0.625 mg  combinations  were  not  significantly 
different from placebo or CE 0.625 mg / MPA 2.5 mg as regards prothrombin time, or partial prothrombin time.  
Conclusions 
Taking  all  results  into  account  it  can  be  concluded  that  a  dose  of  5 mg  BZA  is  insufficient  for  endometrial 
protection with regard to both doses of CE. A dose of 5 mg BZA was not further studied in phase III studies. A 
dose of 20 mg BZA seems to be more effective for endometrial protection in patients treated with CE 0.625 mg 
than a dose of 10 mg BZA. However, 10 mg as well as 20 mg BZA were further studied in combination with CE 
0.45 mg and CE 0.625 mg in phase III study 303. 
The efficacy of CE 0.3 mg for VMS as well as for VVA is considerably compromised by 20 mg BZA. Regarding the 
combination BZA 10 mg / CE 0.3 mg a clinically relevant efficacy on VMS and VVA might be preserved. However, 
in study 303 a dose of 10 mg BZA was clearly insufficient for endometrial protection in patients treated with 
0.45 mg CE. Thus, it is agreed that a dose of 0.3 mg CE in combination with BZA was not further investigated in 
phase III studies. 
For CE 0.625 mg, effects on VMS decreased to some extent with BZA 10 mg compared to the BZA 5 mg while 
between  BZA  10 mg  and  BZA  20 mg  the  effects  were  comparable.  However,  with  all  3  doses  of  BZA  the 
statistically significant differences vs. placebo were observed. 
No statistically significant differences with respect to number and severity of hot flushes were observed between 
the  different  combinations  of  BZA/CE  compared  with  the  same  doses  of  CE  as  monotherapy.  However, 
numerically the effects were somewhat greater in the CE monotherapy groups except for the comparison BZA

5 mg  /  CE  0.3 mg  vs.  CE  0.3 mg.  For  CE  0.625 mg  /  BZA  5 mg,  CE  0.625 mg  /  BZA  10 mg  and  20 mg  no 
statistically  significant  differences  with  respect  to  number  and  severity  of  hot  flushes  were  observed  vs.  CE 
0.625 / 2.5 mg MPA. However, numerically the effects were somewhat greater in the CE/MPA group. 
With regard to CE 0.3 mg the effect on VMI appeared to be highest in the CE 0.3 mg monotherapy group and 
decreased numerically with increasing BZA doses. With regard to CE 0.625 mg similar effects were observed in 
all BZA/CE groups and the CE 0.625 mg monotherapy group while the effect in the placebo group appeared to 
be lower. It is also noted that the effect on the VMI appeared to be higher with CE 0.625 mg / MPA 2.5 mg, 
compared to all combinations of BZA/CE. Statistical significance was not tested regarding these comparisons. 
Results for biochemical markers of bone metabolism were in line with known effects of BZA and CE. As regards 
parameters of lipid metabolism there was no clear dose-relationship. As regards coagulation parameters while 
BZA/CE 10 mg / 0.625 mg and 20 mg / 0.625 mg showed a statistically significant reduction from baseline in 
fibrinogen  levels  compared  to  placebo,  BZA/CE  0.625 mg  combinations  were  not  significantly  different  from 
placebo or CE/MPA 0.625 mg / 2.5 mg as regards prothrombin time or partial prothrombin time.  
2.5.2.  Main studies 
The Applicant has provided data from 4 pivotal Phase 3 studies, studies 303, 305, 306, and 3307 to support the 
submission for registration of BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg and BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg. These studies evaluated 
efficacy and safety of BZA/CE compared to placebo or active comparators. 
Study 303  
Study 303 ‘A double-blind, randomised, placebo- and active-controlled safety and efficacy study of bazedoxifene 
/  conjugated  oestrogens  combinations  in  postmenopausal  women’  is  a  Phase  3  multicentre,  double-blind, 
randomised, outpatient, 8-parallel-group placebo- and active-controlled dose-ranging study evaluating efficacy 
and safety of 6 combinations of BZA/CE (BZA 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg; CE 0.45 mg, 0.625 mg) over 2 years of 
therapy.  
Methods 
Study Participants  
The  study  was  conducted  between  April  2002  and  January  2006  and  enrolled  generally  healthy, 
non-hysterectomised postmenopausal women, aged 40 to 75 years having normal endometrial biopsy results at 
screening.  Inclusion  Criteria  were:  1.  Generally  healthy,  postmenopausal,  age  40  to  75  year;  2.  Serum 
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentration ≥ 30 mIU/mL and serum 17β-estradiol concentration ≤ 183.5 
pmol/L (50 pg/mL) at screening; 3. Intact uterus; 4. Endometrial biopsy report at screening; 5. Last natural 
menstrual cycle completed at least 12 consecutive months before screening, more than 5 years before screening 
in Osteoporosis Prevention I Substudy (study groups C and D), and not more than 5 years before screening in 
Osteoporosis Prevention II and Metabolic Substudy (study groups E and F); 6.  Body mass index (BMI) ≤ 32.2 
kg/m2; 7. Likely being compliant and having a high probability of completing the study by investigator’s opinion; 
8. IRB approved written informed consent signed and dated before screening; 9. In Osteoporosis Substudies 
lumbar spine scans at screening differ by < 5% and total hip scans at screening by < 7.5% at baseline; 10. In 
Osteoporosis Prevention Substudies participants had to have a bone mineral density (BMD) T-score at lumbar 
spine or total hip between -1 and -2.5 incl. and at least one of the following risk factors: a. Family history of 
osteoporosis;  b.  Early  menopause  (≤ 40  years);  c.  Current  history  of  smoking;  d.  Past  history  of  excessive

alcohol  use;  e.  Diet  low  in  calcium;  f.  Inactive  lifestyle;  g.  Thin  or  small  frame  (weight  <  50 kg  or  BMI 
< 18 kg/m2); h. Caucasian or Asian. 
Treatments 
Subjects were randomly assigned to receive 1 of the 6 BZA/CE doses (10 mg / 0.625 mg, 20 mg / 0.625 mg, 40 
mg / 0.625 mg, 10 mg / 0.45 mg, 20 mg / 0.45 mg, 40 mg / 0.45 mg), raloxifene 60 mg, or placebo. Subjects 
were to take 1 capsule orally once daily on a continuous regimen for 2 years. Subjects were also to maintain a 
consistent daily intake of dietary and supplemental calcium and vitamin D during the treatment period, with a 
total daily calcium intake of approximately 1000 to 1600 mg. At the randomization visit, each subject's daily 
calcium  intake  (dietary  plus  supplemental)  was  assessed  and  subjects  requiring  additional  supplementation 
were provided Caltrate 600 + D in open-label market packages as required. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to evaluate the effects of BZA/CE on the incidence  of endometrial hyperplasia in 
postmenopausal  women  after  1 year  of  treatment.  The  secondary  objective  was  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of 
BZA/CE in preventing osteoporosis after 2 years of therapy. Additional objectives were to evaluate the effects on 
safety (including mammography), metabolic parameters (including lipids, serum bone markers, carbohydrates, 
and coagulation factors), vaginal atrophy, uterine bleeding, vasomotor symptoms, and quality-of-life indices. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint of this study was the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia after 1 year of therapy. The 
main secondary endpoint was the mean percent change from baseline in BMD of the lumbar spine after 2 years 
of therapy. The chosen primary and secondary endpoints are adequate to investigate the defined objectives. 
However, as regards the main secondary endpoint, mean percent change from baseline in BMD of the lumbar 
spine after 2 years of therapy, osteoporosis prevention was assessed in the Osteoporosis Prevention Substudy 
I (women >5 YSM with BMD, T-score between -1 and -2.5, at least 1 additional risk factor for osteoporosis) and 
Osteoporosis Prevention Substudy II (women ≥1 and ≤5 YSM, at least 1 additional risk factor for osteoporosis) 
as required by the regulatory guidance on prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis that were in effect at the 
time the study was designed and initiated. Thus the study is primarily designed as a dose-ranging study and the 
osteoporosis prevention indication is assessed only in a substudy and the present study cannot be considered as 
a pivotal main study for the osteoporosis treatment indication. It has to be considered that the relevant CHMP 
guideline  on  postmenopausal  osteoporosis  in  women  has  been  revised  during  the  clinical  development 
programme.  While  revision  1,  effective  since  2001,  considered  an  indication  of  prevention  of  osteoporosis, 
revision 2, effective since May 2007, does no longer have a specific prevention indication. However, prevention 
of osteoporosis is contained in the treatment indication since the goal of therapy is to prevent fractures. Since 
for both components of this fixed combination anti-fracture efficacy has been established, BMD together with 
other markers of bone turnover is considered an adequate surrogate marker. 
Sample size 
The  sample  size  calculation  with  regard  to  endometrial  protection  in  this  study  was  based  on  US  guidance 
documents only. According to the current version of the CHMP Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal 
products for hormone replacement therapy of oestrogen deficiency symptoms in postmenopausal women, the 
Assessment report

Page 57/153 
  
  
 
 
upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of the incidence of hyperplasia should be ≤2%, to conclude to an established 
endometrial safety. 
The sample size calculation with respect to osteoporosis was adequate, as well as randomisation and blinding. 
Overall, the statistical methods were acceptable. 
Randomisation 
Participants were randomised at visit 2B after washout, all screening, and baseline procedures being completed. 
The randomization schedule for packaging and labelling was generated by the Clinical Biostatistics Section of 
Wyeth  Research.  Allocation  of  subjects  to  treatment  groups  proceeded  using  of  a  computerized 
randomization/enrolment interactive voice recognition system (IVRS) accessible by phone and randomization 
and package number were recorded on the CRF.  
Blinding (masking) 
Both study drug and active comparator were provided as single tablets, over-encapsulated for blinding to match 
placebo capsules. Reasons for and date of any unblinding were to be documented on the CRF and in the source 
documents. 
Statistical methods 
The primary endpoint for proof of efficacy in this study was the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia after 1 year 
of therapy, and the primary analysis population was the efficacy evaluable (EE) population for month 12 defined 
as subjects who had taken at least 1 dose of test article, had an endometrial biopsy at screening, an endometrial 
biopsy within 30 days before or after the time point of interest or were diagnosed with hyperplasia at any time 
prior to the time point, and had no major protocol violations. An acceptable rate of hyperplasia was defined as 
an observed rate of 2% or less with a 1-sided 95% upper CI limit of 4% or less. The 1-sided CIs were examined 
using a step-down procedure to correct for the multiplicity of treatment groups. Comparisons to placebo and 
raloxifene were done by examining 95% CIs for pairwise differences in hyperplasia rates. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 10,511 subjects were screened for enrolment in the study, and 3,544 were randomly assigned to the 
8 treatment groups. A total of 147 randomly assigned subjects did not take a test article and are not included in 
any analyses. The remaining 3,397 subjects took at least 1 dose and are included in the safety analyses. Among 
the  3397  subjects  dosed,  2539  (75%)  were  included  in  the  EE  population  for  the  primary  efficacy  analysis 
incidence of endometrial hyperplasia at month 12, 73% in the placebo and 77% and 76% in the BZA/CE 20 mg 
/ 0.45 mg and 20 mg / 0.625 mg groups, respectively. A total of 1454 subjects participated in the Osteoporosis 
Prevention I substudy (OSS I, women > 5 years post-menopausal, Groups C and D) and 1295 (89%) of these 
were included in the MITT population for the primary analysis of percent change from baseline in lumbar spine 
BMD. A total of 861 dosed subjects participated in the Osteoporosis Prevention II and Metabolic substudy (OSS 
II, women ≤ 5 years post-menopausal, Groups E and F) and 783 (91%) were included in the MITT population.

The overall rate of discontinuation from the study was similar across treatment groups (29.8% to 35.7%, overall 
p-value = 0.610, Chi-square). For each group, the most frequent reason for withdrawal was AE, followed by 
subject request unrelated to the study. As regards withdrawal due to AEs, please see also safety assessment 
below.  For  most  discontinuation  reasons,  the  incidence  of  withdrawal  was  similar  across  groups  with  no 
significant  differences  (p  >0.05,  Chi-square).  The  only  exception  was  the  incidence  of  withdrawals  due  to 
unsatisfactory response, which was significantly different among groups (p = 0.002, Chi-square) and higher 
among subjects treated with placebo (12; 2.8%) and raloxifene (9; 2.1%) than for the other groups. The rate 
of  protocol  violations  leading  to  discontinuation  was  low.  Overall,  protocol  deviations  appear  to  have  been 
adequately addressed and dealt with by the Applicant. It is agreed that no major impact on study results are to 
be expected. 
There  were  no  significant  differences  among  groups  regarding  baseline  characteristics,  but  the  population 
consisted of mainly younger postmenopausal women and the number of women with other than white ethnicity 
is sparse. Considering the populations for the Osteoporosis Prevention I and II substudies, women in Substudy 
II  were  generally  younger  (mean  age  approximately  52  years)  than  those  in  Substudy  I  (mean  age 
approximately 59 years). Similarly, the mean number of years since the last menstrual period was 11.14 years 
for Substudy I as compared with 2.99 years for Substudy II, and 8.10 years for the overall population. Based on 
BMD data for lumbar spine, the mean T-score at baseline was -1.47 for women in Substudy I and -0.83 for those 
in Substudy II. In addition, the incidence of elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure at baseline was greater 
among women in Substudy I than in Substudy II. 
Recruitment

Baseline data 
Subjects were generally healthy, non-hysterectomised postmenopausal women, ranging in age from 40 to 75 
years, with a mean age of 56.5 years. Body mass index (BMI) ranged from 16.2 to 35.7 kg/m² with a mean of 
25.8 kg/m², and approximately 59.0% of subjects had BMI ≥ 25 kg/m². The mean number of years since the 
last menstrual period for these subjects was 8.1, and the mean age at the time of the last menstrual period was 
48.9  years.  Baseline  characteristics  were  similar  across  treatment  groups,  and  there  were  no  statistically 
significant differences among treatment groups for any baseline characteristics, except for maternal history of 
fracture (p = 0.043, Chi-Square), which was approximately 7% overall and ranged from 4% to 10%. Overall, 
there were no significant differences among groups regarding baseline characteristics. However, the population 
consisted of mainly younger postmenopausal women and the number of women with other than white ethnicity 
is sparse. 
Numbers analysed 
A total of 3397 subjects were randomly assigned and took at least 1 dose. The numbers analysed for the primary 
and secondary analyses are summarised below. The primary analysis population for endometrial hyperplasia 
was  the  EE  population  for  month  12,  while  secondary  analyses  were  conducted  using  data  from  the  MITT 
population.

b prespecified 1-sided 97.5% confidence interval per stepwise procedure, to adjust for multiple comparisons (CE 0.45mg combined with BZA 
40 mg and 20 mg) 
It is noted that even in this GCP non-compliant study, 3 cases of endometrial hyperplasia / malignancy had been 
detected in the two BZA/CE groups during the second treatment year. This is considered as a safety signal. In 
addition, it is noted that at month 12, the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of the incidence of endometrial 
hyperplasia / malignancy was above the reference limit of 2% stated in the CHMP HRT Guideline in the BZA 
20 mg / CE 0.625 mg group. 
Bone mineral density 
The MITT analysis of the main secondary endpoint mean percent change from baseline in BMD of the lumbar 
spine after 2 years of therapy showed significant increases in lumbar spine BMD from baseline to month 24 in 
both  substudies  for  all  groups  except  placebo  were  BMD  values  decreased.  Increases  in  BMD  were  most 
pronounced with the lowest dose of BZA of 10 mg attenuating with increasing doses of BZA. In the elder group 
of women >5 years postmenopausal effects were more pronounced with BZA/CE containing either 10 or 20 mg 
BZA, but  not 40 mg, compared to raloxifene 60 mg; in the younger  women  ≤5 years postmenopausal BMD 
increases were more pronounced with all doses of BZA/CE. However, results were only marginally significant for 
BZA/CE 20 mg / 0.45 mg in the elder women and for both BZA 40 mg / CE in younger women.

The responder analysis was in line with these findings; in both substudies, consistent with the primary analysis, 
responder rates tended to be higher with higher doses of conjugated oestrogens and lower doses of BZA. Thus, 
in general higher doses of CEs induced larger increases in BMD, while increases in the BZA dosage attenuated 
the effects of CEs.  
At total hip women > 5 years (OSS I)and women ≤ 5 years (OSS II) post-menopausal treated with BZA/CE had 
significant increases in total hip BMD from baseline to month 24 compared to a decrease in BMD in the placebo 
group. Increases were numerically larger for all BZA/CE groups than for raloxifene in OSS I and in OSS II were 
significant for all BZA/CE groups except 20 mg / 0.625 mg and 40 mg / 0.45 mg.  
Results from the EE and Completer analyses of BMD were consistent with results from the primary analysis.  
Serum markers of bone metabolism were determined for subjects participating in OSS II. At all time-points and 
for all BZA/CE doses the median percent changes from baseline in serum concentrations of C-telopeptide and 
osteocalcin were significantly greater than for placebo, indicating a decrease in bone turnover.  
The efficacy analyses of height used data from the EE populations pooled from both substudies. Data analysed 
for month 12 and 24 showed little effect on change in height with BZA/CE or raloxifene.  
Other endpoints  
Efficacy  on  hot  flushes  (VMS)  was  evaluated  in  a  subpopulation  of  216  postmenopausal  women  who  were 
experiencing a minimum of 7 moderate to severe hot flushes per day or 50 or more per week at baseline. All 
dose of BZA/CE except BZA/CE 40 mg / 0.625 mg induced a greater reduction in the number of moderate to 
severe hot flushes than placebo at week 4 and week 12.  
In  the  vulvar-vaginal  atrophy  (VVA)  subpopulation  as  with  effects  on  BMD  the  lowest  doses  of  BZA  tested, 
10 mg,  together  with  higher  doses  of  CE  were  most  effective  as  regards  measures  of  vaginal  atrophy.  The 
applied dose of BZA/CE 20 mg / 0.45 mg was not significantly more effective than placebo in increasing the 
mean proportion of superficial cells from baseline. It is also noted that the differences between BZA 20 mg / CE 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/383987/2014 
Page 63/153 
  
  
 
 
 
0.45 mg and BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg with respect to mean change from baseline in proportion of superficial 
cells  and  parabasal  cells  were  numerically  small.  The  clinical  relevance  seems  doubtful.  It  was  not  tested 
whether the difference between the two dose groups was statistically significant. This issue is further discussed 
with regard to the pivotal study regarding VVA (study 306 below). 
As regards quality of sleep, fixed combination with BZA 10 mg or 20 mg and 0.625 mg CE were most effective. 
As regards sexual activity there were no significant differences between groups while for dyspareunia there was 
a trend for a decrease in the percent of women with dyspareunia with BZA/CE combinations containing 10 mg or 
20 mg BZA versus an increase with raloxifene or placebo. Analysis of the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life 
(MENQOL)  questionnaire  showed  some  improvements  compared  to  placebo  again  especially  with  doses  of 
10 mg  BZA.  There  were  no  significant  differences  in  the  incidence  of  breast  pain  between  groups.  The 
percentages of women with cumulative amenorrhea were comparable between groups including placebo with 
the exception of BZA/CE 10 mg / 0.625 mg were percentages were lower. 
In conclusion while in the analysis of the primary endpoint of endometrial hyperplasia the lowest dose of BZA, 
10 mg, was not sufficiently effective, the most efficacious dose as regards osteoporosis is the lowest dose of 
10 mg with effects attenuating with increasing the dose of BZA. Importantly study 303 was classified as GCP 
non-compliant and should not be taken into account for the assessment of efficacy of BZA / CE.

Study 4000 
This was an ancillary study that examined the mammograms taken at baseline and at month 24 from a subset 
of subjects who completed study 303, the primary study, and who had received BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg, BZA 
20 mg / CE 0.625 mg, RAL, or placebo in this study. A single radiologist performed the quantifications of breast 
density  in  pairs.  The  radiologist  was  blinded  to  the  time  sequence  (baseline  versus  month  24),  treatment 
assignment, and subject information. 
Breast  density  was  determined  by  using  software  developed  by  Byng  et  al.  The  digitized  mammogram  was 
displayed on a workstation monitor. The skin and pectoral muscle lines were first drawn to define the total breast 
area. Then a histogram computed the density (in pixels) of the outlined breast. To obtain the percentage of 
breast occupied by breast tissue, the following formula was used: 
Results 
The study population consisted of 132, 111, 129, and 135 subjects in the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg, BZA 20 mg 
/ CE 0.625 mg, RAL 60 mg and placebo groups, respectively. A total of 22 subject´s data were excluded from 
the breast density analysis because of protocol deviations (mammogram not technically acceptable for reading 
or missing mammogram at baseline or at month 24). The main results are summarised in the following table:

Table 20: Summary of breast density measurements at baseline and month 24 
The conclusion in the study report that this study has shown that, in healthy postmenopausal women with a 
mean age of 56 years, BZA/CE treatment did not affect age-related changes in mammographic breast density 
was not fully agreed by the CHMP. The decrease in breast density seemed numerically less pronounced with BZA 
20 mg  /  CE  0.625 mg,  compared  to  BZA  20 mg  /  CE  0.45 mg  and  placebo.  Thus,  an  unfavourable  effect  of 
BZA/CE, in particular regarding BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg, on breast density cannot be excluded, even taking 
into account that this was a GCP non-compliant study. 
Study 305 
Study  305  was  a  Phase  3,  multicentre,  double-blind,  randomised,  3-parallel-group  placebo-controlled  study 
designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg and BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg for the 
treatment of VMS (oestrogen deficiency symptom indication), conducted in the US. 
Methods 
Study Participants  
In brief, the study enrolled generally healthy women with an intact uterus, aged 40 to 65 years, with at least 12 
months  of  spontaneous  amenorrhea  or  6  months  of  spontaneous  amenorrhea,  and  who  had  a  serum 
follicle-stimulating hormone level > 40 mIU/mL. In addition, the women had to be seeking treatment for hot 
flushes and report at screening a minimum of 7 moderate to severe hot flushes per day or 50 per week. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/383987/2014 
Page 70/153 
  
  
 
 
 
Treatments 
Subjects were randomly assigned to receive BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg, BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg or placebo for 
a treatment duration of 12 weeks. No control group treated with CE combined with a progestin such as MPA was 
included. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to assess the safety and efficacy of 2 doses of BZA/CE compared with placebo for the 
treatment of moderate to severe VMS associated with menopause. The secondary objectives were to assess the 
effect of BZA/CE on breast pain and to assess the results from the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) sleep scale. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  efficacy  variables  were  the  change  from  baseline  at  week  4  and  week  12  in  the  average  daily 
number  of  moderate  and  severe  hot  flushes  and  the  severity  of  hot  flushes.  Secondary  endpoints  included 
further parameters related to VMS, self-administered questionnaires MOS sleep scale, MENQOL, and MS-TSQ as 
well  as  the  presence  of  breast  pain.  The  primary  analysis  population  was  the  MITT  population,  defined  as 
subjects who were randomly assigned test article, had taken at least 1 dose of test article, had recorded at least 
5  days  data  at  the  baseline  week  and  had  at  least  5  days  data  for  at  least  1  on-therapy  week,  with  LOCF 
approach. 
Sample size 
A sample size of 104 subjects per group for the BZA/CE treatment groups and 52 subjects for the control group 
was to provide greater than 90% power to detect a difference of 3 hot flushes between a BZA/CE treatment 
group  and  placebo  with  a  0.05  two-sided  significance  level  (standard  deviation  [SD]  =  4.8).  A  total  of  130 
subjects in each BZA/CE treatment group and 65 subjects in each control group were to be enrolled to have 
allowed for up to 20% of the subjects being excluded from the analysis. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were allocated to treatment groups through the use of a CORE system that was accessible 24 hours a 
day. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study used a double-blind design. Test article were be supplied as 2 doses of bazedoxifene/CE capsules and 
matching placebo capsules. 
Statistical methods 
Three populations were defined for the efficacy endpoints:  
(1)  Modified-intent-to-treat  (MITT)  population  for  analysis  of  hot  flushes  (the  MITT  population  with  LOCF 
approach was considered to be the primary analysis population at week 4 and week 12), (2) Per-Protocol (PP) 
population (3) Safety population for analysis of hot flushes included all subjects who were randomly assigned 
and took at least 1 dose of test article.

The reduction of the average daily number and severity of hot flushes was compared between BZA/CE dose 
groups and placebo using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)  with treatment and study site as factors and 
baseline  value  as  a  covariate  plus  treatment  by  study  site  interaction.  Pairwise  comparisons  between  the 
BZA/CE groups and placebo were made using a t-test based on the least square means and pooled error terms 
obtained from the ANCOVA.

Protocol  violations  which  led  to  study  discontinuation  included  criteria  for  hot  flushes  not  met  (n=5), 
endometrial thickness >4 mm or not measurable (n=4), non-compliance with medication or diary cards (n=2), 
subject meeting exclusion criterion 4c with respect to TVUS (n=1), subject meeting exclusion criterion 4c and 
not meeting inclusion criterion 4 with respect to endometrial biopsy (n=1), and subject randomised in error 
(n=1). 
Conduct of the study 
The study protocol is dated 19 July 2005. There were no protocol amendments. 
Baseline data 
The 3 study groups were comparable regarding baseline characteristics. 
Outcomes and estimation 
With regard to all primary endpoints, statistically significant differences favouring BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg and 
BZA  20 mg  /  CE  0.625 mg  vs.  placebo  were  found  in  the  analysis  using  the  LOCF  approach  which  was 
prespecified in the protocol. The results are displayed in the following tables.

and week 12 (LOCF, OC)

Table 22: Mean change from baseline in the average daily severity score hot flushes at week 4 and week 12 
(LOCF, OC) 
With regard to missing values, sensitivity analyses were submitted raising no concerns as regards the validity of 
the results. However, the difference between BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg and BZA 20 mg / CE0.45 mg at week 
12 with regard to number (-0.42) as well as severity of hot flushes (-0.34) is small. Statistical significance was 
not tested.  
With  regard  to  all  secondary  endpoints  related  to  VMS  and  most  items  of  the  MOS  sleep  scale,  statistically 
significant  differences  favouring  the  2  BZA/CE  groups  vs.  placebo  were  observed.  Regarding  MENQOL, 
statistically significant differences vs. placebo at week 12 (MITT) were observed regarding all 5 criteria in the 
BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg group, and regarding 2 of 5 items in the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg group. With regard 
to breast pain, the differences vs. placebo were not statistically significant for both BZA/CE groups. 
However, the differences  between BZA 20 mg / CE  0.45 mg and BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg with respect to 
efficacy  in  the  treatment  of  hot  flushes  are  in  most  cases  numerically  small  and  of  questionable  clinical 
relevance. 
It is also noted that no CE /progestin control group was included in this study pivotal for the efficacy in the 
treatment of hot flushes. According to the results of phase 2 study 203, BZA obviously decreases the efficacy of 
CE on VMS. A control group treated with oral CE/MPA should have been included in order to investigate in more 
detail to which extent the efficacy of CE in the combination BZA/CE is decreased and how the benefit risk balance 
of  BZA/CE  compares  to  the  currently  established  treatment  of  hot  flushes  with  an  oestrogen  /  progestogen 
combination.

The daily severity score was calculated by 
multiplying the number of mild, moderate and 
severe hot flushes by 1, 2 and 3, respectively. 
These values were added and then divided by the 
total number of hot flushes. 
The average daily severity of hot flushes was 
calculated as: 
responder analysis (responders defined as subjects 
who reached at least a 50% or a 75% decrease 
from baseline in the number of hot flushes for 
moderate and severe hot flushes and for mild, 
moderate, and severe hot flushes); 
reduction in the number of mild, moderate, and 
severe hot flushes; 
reduction in the daily composite score;

number of hot flushes for at least 3 consecutive 
days;

Study 306 
Study  306  was  a  Phase  3,  multicentre,  double-blind,  randomised,  outpatient,  4-parallel-group  placebo-  and 
active-controlled  study  designed  to  assess  the  efficacy  of  BZA  20 mg  /  CE  0.45 mg  and  BZA  20 mg  /  CE 
0.625 mg compared with placebo and BZA 20 mg for the treatment of VVA. The study was conducted in the US. 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Generally healthy women, 40 to 65 years of age, who had an intact uterus and were postmenopausal, were 
enrolled.  At  screening,  all  subjects  had  to  have  a  vaginal  cytological  smear  showing  ≤  5%  superficial  cells, 
vaginal pH > 5.0; and had to self-identify on the Symptom Questionnaire at least 1 moderate to severe vulvar 
/  vaginal  symptom  that  was  most  bothersome  to  them  (vaginal  dryness,  irritation  /  itching,  or  pain  with 
intercourse). 
Treatments 
Subjects were randomly assigned to receive BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg, BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg, BZA 20 mg 
or placebo for the duration of a treatment of 12 weeks.

Objectives 
The primary objective was to compare the efficacy and safety of 2 doses of BZA/CE (BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg 
and BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg) with those of placebo at 12 weeks for the treatment of moderate to severe 
vulvar/vaginal atrophy associated with menopause. The secondary objectives were to assess the efficacy and 
safety  of  2  doses  of  BZA/CE  compared  with  placebo  at  4  weeks  for  the  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe 
vulvar/vaginal  atrophy  associated  with  menopause;  to  provide  descriptive  vulvar/vaginal  atrophy  data 
comparing BZA/CE with BZA alone at 4 and 12 weeks; and to assess the effect of 2 doses of BZA/CE on changes 
at 4 and 12 weeks in each vulvar/vaginal symptom (vaginal dryness, vaginal and/or vulvar irritation/itching, and 
vaginal pain associated with sexual activity). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  co-primary  endpoints  for  vulvar  /  vaginal  atrophy  were  the  increase  in  superficial  cells,  decrease  in 
parabasal cells, lowering of vaginal pH, and improvement in the most bothersome symptom at week 12. 
Secondary  efficacy  endpoints  included  the  proportion  of  vaginal  intermediate  cells  by  vaginal  smear,  and 
individual  symptoms  from  the  Symptom  Questionnaire  (i.e.,  dryness,  itching,  or  pain  with  intercourse).  A 
responder analysis was also conducted. Responders were defined as subjects who had 1 or more of the following 
at the week 12 (LOCF) evaluation: vaginal superficial cells > 5%, vaginal pH < 5, or improvement of their Most 
Bothersome Symptom by at least 1 category from baseline. Other secondary efficacy variables included the 
Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale (ASEX); the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL) questionnaire; and 
the Menopause Symptoms-Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (MS-TSQ). 
Vaginal  maturation  (VM)  was  assessed  by  determination  of  the  proportion  of  superficial,  parabasal,  and 
intermediate cells in samples of vaginal epithelium obtained from vaginal smears. Results were read centrally 
and remained blinded to the investigators and to the subjects for the duration of the study. 
The  Symptom  Questionnaire  collected  information  on  3  vulvar  /  vaginal  symptoms:  dryness  of  the  vagina, 
itching or irritation of the vagina or vulva, and pain with intercourse. Subjects were to rate the intensity of each 
symptom (rated as none, mild, moderate, or severe) experienced during the past week. At screening only, the 
subject was to indicate the moderate or severe symptom that bothered her most. This symptom was identified 
as  the  subject's  "Most  Bothersome  Symptom"  for  the  remainder  of  the  study.  Diaries  were  used  to  capture 
intake of medication and symptoms / complaints. 
Sample size 
A total of 152 subjects in each BZA/CE treatment group and 76 subjects in each control group were needed to 
detect a 5% difference between groups in the percentage of superficial cells (assuming standard deviation [SD] 
of 11%), with 90% power; 190 and 95 subjects, respectively, would ensure adequate numbers of subjects for 
the analysis even if up to 20% of the subjects were excluded from the analysis because of missing data. Because 
the goal was to show statistical significance at the 0.05 level for the 4 co-primary endpoints, the sample size was 
increased to 215 for each BZA/CE group and 110 for each control group to ensure that at least 172 and 88, 
respectively, were available for inclusion in the analyses. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were allocated to treatment groups through the use of a CORE system that was accessible 24 hours a 
day.

Blinding (masking) 
The study used a double-blind design. Test article was supplied as 2 doses of BZA/CE (BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg 
and BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg), BZA 20 mg, and matching placebo. Both study drug and active comparator were 
provided as single tablets, over-encapsulated for blinding to match placebo capsules. 
Statistical methods 
For all efficacy variables except for MS-TSQ, the primary efficacy population was the modified-intent-to-treat 
population  (MITT),  defined  as  all  subjects  who  were  randomised,  took  at  least  1  dose  of  test  article,  had  a 
baseline value, and had at least 1 on-therapy value for the parameter being analysed, using an LOCF approach

Conduct of the study 
A total of 100 subjects (15.3%) had protocol violations. Seven patients were withdrawn from the study due to 
protocol  violations:  hyperplasia  in  endometrial  biopsy  (n=1),  endometrial thickness  in  TVUS  >4  mm  (n=1), 
vaginal maturation index exclusionary (n=1), subject receiving exclusionary co-medication (n=1), insufficient 
vaginal smear material at screening (n=1), and non-compliance with medication or diary cards (n=2). 
Baseline data 
The 3 study groups were comparable regarding demographic baseline characteristics. With respect to baseline 
data for primary endpoints, vaginal smears and vaginal pH were comparable in the 4 study groups. Regarding 
the type and severity of the MBS, the data were similar in the two BZA/CE groups, with pain with intercourse 
being clearly the most frequent MBS. In the BZA group and the placebo group, vaginal dryness and pain with 
intercourse were stated as MBS almost equally frequently.

Figure 4: Percentage of subjects with most bothersome symptom – data by severity at week 12 
With regard to vaginal maturation statistically significant differences favouring both BZA/CE groups vs. placebo 
were  found  in  the  nonparametric  analysis  in  the  MITT  population  using  the  LOCF  approach  which  had  been 
prespecified as the primary analysis in the study protocol in case data were not normally distributed. With regard 
to vaginal pH, the difference vs. placebo was statistically significant only in the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg group, 
not in the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg group. 
For BZA, differences vs. placebo were not statistically significant regarding superficial cells and vaginal pH while 
regarding parabasal cells even a significant increase vs. baseline was observed. 
With regard to MBS, a statistically significant difference favouring BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg vs. placebo was 
found in the parametric analysis in the MITT population using the LOCF approach which had been prespecified as 
the primary analysis in the study protocol. Regarding the lower dose strength BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg and 
BZA 20 mg monotherapy, the difference vs. placebo was not statistically significant. 
With regard to the issue of missing values, additional sensitivity analyses using different methods for replacing 
missing values were performed supporting the results reported in the study report. 
No comparison of BZA/CE vs. CE/progestin is possible based on this study as no CE/progestin control group was 
included. It seems that BZA  negatively affects the  efficacy of CE on  VVA.  It is assumed that the efficacy of 
BZA/CE in the treatment of VVA is lower than the efficacy if CE/progestin. A control group treated with either a 
local  oestrogen  or  with  oral  CE/MPA  should  have  been  included  in  order  to  investigate  the  decrease  of  the 
efficacy of CE when it is administered in combination with BZA in the treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy in more 
detail. 
A formal comparison of BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg vs. BZA 20 mg / CE 0.65 mg regarding primary endpoints was 
not planned. The numerical differences between BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg and BZA 20 mg / CE0.45 mg with 
regard to change from baseline at week 12 regarding superficial cells and parabasal cells as well as with regard 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/383987/2014

to MBS at week 12 are small. Statistical significance was not tested. Thus, the higher dose strength applied for 
appears to be insufficiently justified for the treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy as already discussed above with 
respect to the treatment of hot flushes. 
Regarding secondary endpoints, statistically significant differences vs. placebo were observed with regard to 
responder rates at week 12 and mean change from baseline in the proportion of vaginal intermediate cells at 
week 12 and proportion of patients with no dryness of the vagina at week 12. Regarding itching / irritation of the 
vagina and pain wit intercourse no statistically significant differences were observed. 
Statistically significant differences favouring BZA/CE were observed with regard to some but not all items of 
ASEX  Scores,  MENQOL,  and  MS-TSQ.  In  particular  with  regard  to  itching  /  dryness  of  the  vagina  and 
dyspareunia  at  week  12  the  results  were  numerically  somewhat  inferior  to  placebo  in  the  BZA  20 mg  /  CE 
0.45 mg group and similar to placebo in the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg group. 
As was already observed with respect to primary endpoints, the differences between BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg 
and BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg are numerically small; statistical significance was not tested.

of  bazedoxifene  /  conjugated  oestrogens  combinations  on  endometrial  hyperplasia  and  prevention  of 
osteoporosis  in  postmenopausal  women’  was  a  Phase  3  outpatient,  multicentre,  double-blind,  randomised, 
placebo- and active-controlled study conducted between January 2009 and February 2011.  
The trial consisted of a main study and included 3 substudies, i.e. osteoporosis (OSS), sleep, and breast density 
substudies. 
Methods 
Study Participants  
It included generally healthy postmenopausal women with an intact uterus aged between 40 to 65 years. The 
inclusion and exclusion criteria are acceptable, but as the study excluded women above the age of 65 years this 
adds to the sparsity of data in the elderly and thus in the overall clinical programme. 
Treatments 
Participants  received  either  BZA/CE  20 mg  /  0.45 mg,  BZA/CE  20 mg  /  0.625 mg,  BZA  20 mg,  CE/MPA 
0.45 mg/1.5 mg, or placebo. 
Objectives 
The primary objectives of this study were to investigate the endometrial safety of both BZA 20 mg / CE doses 
and  the  effect  in  preventing  postmenopausal  osteoporosis  in  the  OSS  after  1  year  of  therapy.  Secondary 
objectives included comparison of effects on BMD between BZA/CE and BZA 20 mg, the effect of BZA/CE versus 
placebo and BZA 20 mg on bone turnover markers (BTM), the effect of BZA/CE versus placebo and CE/MPA on 
uterine  bleeding  /  spotting  and  on  breast  tenderness,  noninferiority  of  BZA/CE  to  placebo  on  quantitative 
changes in mammographic breast density, and the effect of BZA/CE versus placebo on sleep parameters in a 
subset of women with bothersome VMS at baseline.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
For the main endpoints endometrial hyperplasia was assessed by endometrial biopsies performed at screening 
and after 1 year of therapy; biopsies were analysed by central readings by 2 or 3 pathologists, depending on 
whether there was a disagreement between first two assessments. BMD measurements of the lumbar spine 
were performed by DXA expand scan at least twice during screening, once at Month 6, and twice during Month 
12. BTM osteocalcin, C-telopeptide, and procollagen type 1 N-propeptide (P1NP) were measured at Month 3, 
Month 6 and Year 1. The Sleep substudy was analysed using the medical outcomes study (MOS) Sleep Scale. 
Breast Density was obtained by digital mammography performed at baseline and at Week 52 or at Week 26 for 
patients  who  withdrew  early  from  the  study.  The  chosen  endpoints  are  adequate  to  investigate  the  defined 
objectives. In particular, the evaluation of endometrial biopsies is in accordance with the CHMP Guideline on 
clinical investigation of medicinal products for hormone replacement therapy of oestrogen deficiency symptoms 
in  postmenopausal  women  (EMEA/CHMP/021/97  Rev.  1).  As  mentioned  for  Study  303  the  relevant  CHMP 
guideline  on  postmenopausal  osteoporosis  in  women  has  been  revised  during  the  clinical  development 
programme.  While  revision  1,  effective  since  2001,  considered  an  indication  of  prevention  of  osteoporosis, 
revision  2,  effective  since  May  2007,  does  no  longer  have  a  specific  prevention  indication.  Nevertheless, 
prevention  of  osteoporosis  is  contained  in  the  treatment  indication  since  the  goal  of  therapy  is  to  prevent 
fractures. In contrast to Study 303, however this trial was started (January 2009) long after revision 2 came into 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/383987/2014 
Page 87/153 
  
  
 
 
effect  (May  2007).  As  with  trial  303  aspects  regarding  the  prevention  of  osteoporosis  have  only  been 
investigated in a substudy of trial 3307 and are thus not considered pivotal for this indication.  
Sample size 
The  sample  size  calculation  was  based  on  the  endometrial  hyperplasia  endpoint.  The  FDA  recommended  in 
January 2003 draft guidance on oestrogen products that the endometrial hyperplasia observed rate at year 1 
had to be ≤ 1% with the upper limit of the 1-sided 95% CI less than 4%. The sample size of 300 subjects having 
at least 1 year follow-up in each BZA/CE group was sufficient for population rates up to 0.5%. The EMA/CHMP 
Guideline  on  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal  products  for  hormone  replacement  therapy  of  oestrogen 
deficiency symptoms in postmenopausal women (EMEA/CHMP/021/97 Rev. 1, Oct 2005) recommends that the 
upper limit of a 2-sided 95% CI of the observed incidence of endometrial hyperplasia should not exceed 2%. 
Sample size calculation was judged adequate by the CHMP.  
Randomisation 
The randomization was to be stratified by whether or not a subject participated in the OSS. The randomization 
ratio for the main study and the OSS was 2:2:1:1:2 (BZA/CE 20 mg/0.45 mg, 20 mg/0.625 mg, BZA 20 mg, 
CE/MPA 0.45 mg/1.5 mg, placebo). 
Blinding (masking) 
Blinding  was  accomplished  by  over-encapsulating  the  BZA/CE,  BZA  and  CE/MPA  tablets  in  capsules  that 
matched the placebo capsules. 
Statistical methods 
The incidence of endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy at Month 12 for each treatment group was calculated for 
the  EE  population  (primary  analysis  population)  as:  I = A / B,  where  I = incidence  at  Month  12  evaluation, 
A = all  subjects  in  the  EE  population  with  biopsy  results  positive  for  endometrial  hyperplasia  or  malignancy 
during first 12 months, and B = all subjects in the EE population defined as subjects randomly assigned and at 
least 1 dose of the test article taken, having screening endometrial biopsy with readings by at least 2 blinded 
central  pathologists,  having  had  a  biopsy  during  Month  12,  or  hyperplasia  diagnosed  before  Month  12,  and 
having had no major protocol violations. For all groups the incidence of endometrial malignancy at 12 months 
and the associated exact 1-sided and 2-sided 95% CI were calculated with an acceptable hyperplasia rate of 1% 
or less with an upper 1-sided 95% confidence limit of 4% or less. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Four thousand seven hundred seventy four (4774) women were screened. There were 2888 screen failures and 
thus 1886 women were randomly assigned; 43 of these did not take any test article and are not included in any 
analyses. The remaining 1843 subjects took at least one dose and are included in the safety analyses.

Overall, discontinuations in the main study were comparable between BZA/CE 20 mg / 0.45 mg (19.8%), and 
20 mg / 0.625 mg groups (17.1%), BZA 20 mg group (19.6%), and placebo (19.2%), but discontinuations were 
higher  in  the  CE/MPA  0.45 mg  /  1.5 mg  group  (27.7%).  Differences  were  even  more  pronounced  in  the 
osteoporosis substudy. Rates ranged from about 15% in the BZA/CE 20 mg / 0.625 mg to 27% in the CE/MPA 
group, about 25% discontinued in the BZA 20 mg monotherapy group. A literature review however showed that 
the  overall  rate  of  discontinuation  in  study  3307  was  consistent  with  overall  rates  observed  in  studies  with 
SERMs in women with PMO and as regards the influence of the differences on the interpretation of the BMD data 
a conservative approach was used for the primary analysis of these data (LOCF) and a set of sensitivity analyses 
(BOCF, MMRM, CDC, JC) was consistent with the primary analysis, indicating that the differential drop-out rates 
across groups have no significant influence on the evaluation of the BMD efficacy results. As regards numbers 
analysed for the primary analysis only 75% in the placebo and 75% and 78% in the BZA/CE 20 mg / 0.45 mg 
and 20 mg / 0.625 mg groups, respectively, have been included. The percent of women included was even lower 
in the CE/MPA group with 68%.

Conduct of the study 
The original protocol was issued on 20 Nov 2008. Two protocol amendments were implemented following the 
first visit of the first subject. Protocol Amendment 1 was issued on 08 May 2009 and Protocol Amendment 2 was 
issued on 08 Jun 2010. 
Protocol  deviations  occurred,  but  these  appear  to  have  been  adequately  addressed  and  dealt  with  by  the 
Applicant.  It  is  agreed that  no  major impact  on  study  results  are  to  be expected.  There  were  no  significant 
differences among groups regarding baseline characteristics, but the population investigated was even younger 
than in trial 303 and the number of women with other than white ethnicity again was low. 
Baseline data 
Overall, there were no significant differences among groups regarding baseline characteristics. However, the 
population investigated was even younger than in trial 303 and the number of women with other than white 
ethnicity again is low. 
Numbers analysed 
Among the 1843 randomised subjects who took at least 1 dose, 1375 (75%) and 1465 (79%) were included in 
the EE and MITT populations, respectively, for the endometrial hyperplasia analyses. Overall, 1477 (78.3%) 
subjects  completed  the  study.  For  the  primary  analysis  only  75%  in  the  placebo  and  75%  and  78%  in  the 
BZA/CE 20 mg/0.45 mg and 20 mg/0.625 mg groups, respectively, have been included. The percent of women 
included was even lower in the CE/MPA group with 68%. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Endometrial hyperplasia 
Two  definitions  for  defining  cases  of  endometrial  hyperplasia  were  used.  For  Definition  1  endometrial 
hyperplasia  was  assumed  if  at  least  1  pathologist  determined  hyperplasia.  For  definition  2  a  diagnosis  of 
hyperplasia was based on at least 2 positive diagnosis. 
It is reported that at month 12, 324 of 445 dosed subjects in the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg group and 351 of 474 
dosed subjects in the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg group had evaluable biopsies. Using definition 2 which is in 
accordance with the CHMP Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for hormone replacement 
therapy of oestrogen deficiency symptoms in postmenopausal women (EMEA/CHMP/021/97 Rev. 1, 13 October 
2005), one case of endometrial hyperplasia in each of these 2 groups is reported at month 12. No endometrial 
carcinomas  were  observed  in  this  study.  Based  on  314  and  333  evaluable  biopsies  in  the  BZA  20 mg  /  CE 
0.45 mg group and the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg group, respectively, the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia 
/ malignancy at month 12 was 0.32% (95% CI 0.01%; 1.76%) and 0.30% (2-sided 95% CI 0.01; 01.66%), 
respectively.  Thus,  the  upper  limit  of  the  2-sided  95%  confidence  interval  of  the  incidence  of  endometrial 
hyperplasia was below the reference limit of 2% stated in the CHMP HRT Guideline in each of the two groups. 
Nevertheless,  the  following  issues  with  regard  to  the  analysis  of  the  incidence  of  endometrial  hyperplasia  / 
malignancy in study 3307 are considered as not reassuring: 
Only  the  diagnosis  of  the  endometrial  biopsy,  not  a  more  detailed  description  of  the  macroscopic  and 
microscopic findings by the pathologists is available. Thus, more detailed information on cases diagnosed as 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/383987/2014 
Page 90/153 
  
  
 
 
“endometrium,  other”  could  not  be  provided  by  the  Applicant  and  no  further  assessment  in  this  respect  is 
possible. 
In addition, in study 3307, concerns remain with regard to 4 patients in the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg in whom 
no  biopsy  was  performed  at  month  12  and  endometrial  thickness  was  ≥4  mm.  It  is  acknowledged  that  the 
Applicant reported that these 4 patients had refused a biopsy. In addition, in 8 patients of the BZA 20 mg / CE 
0.45 mg group neither a biopsy nor TVUS was performed. In 4 patients, no reasons are given. In the other 4 
subjects, biopsy and TVUs were refused or the patient had moved. In summary, in 12 patients of the BZA 20 mg 
/ CE 0.45 mg group, the outcome with respect to endometrial histology cannot be considered as reassuring. As 
already stated above, a very low number of additional cases of hyperplasia would change the outcome of the 
study from success to failure. 
Thus, currently endometrial safety cannot be concluded. 
Bone mineral density 
For both BZA/CE doses there were significant increases in mean percent change from baseline in BMD of lumbar 
spine at Month 12 and Month 6 (secondary) compared to placebo as well as well as in total hip BMD at Month 12. 
Changes in BMD were not statistically significant between BZA monotherapy, BZA/CE, and CE/MPA groups, but 
effects were most pronounced with CE/MPA.

The analyses of the BMD of the lumbar spine at Month 12 in the MITT population observed cases (OC) and in the 
PP population were consistent with the results from the primary analyses. In the BMD responder analysis the 
lumbar spine responder rates were significantly greater for both BZA/CE and the CE/MPA group compared to 
placebo at Month 12 (p≤0.001). Differences for BZA 20 mg / CE compared to BZA 20 mg at Month 12 were not 
statistically  significant  (p=0.323  and  0.101,  respectively).  The  total  hip  responder  rates  were  significantly 
greater for all treatment groups compared with placebo at Month 12, but total hip responder rates were not 
statistically significant different between BZA 20 mg / CE and BZA 20 mg at Month 12 (p=0.740 and 0.127, 
respectively). 
The non-inferiority analysis for BMD showed non-inferiority of BZA/CE 20 mg / 0.625 mg to BZA 20 mg but no 
superiority, whilst BZA/CE 20 mg / 0.45 mg failed the pre-specified non-inferiority criterion. 
Others 
The cumulative rate of amenorrhea was similar to placebo in both the BZA/CE treatment groups over a 1 year 
treatment period, while it was significantly lower with CE/MPA treatment. The bleeding and spotting profile of 
both BZA/CE groups was significantly better than that for the CE/MPA group. There was no significant difference 
in  the  incidence  of  subjects  reporting  breast  tenderness  between  BZA/CE  and  placebo  groups,  while  it  was 
significantly higher in the CE/MPA group. There were no significant differences between both BZA/CE groups and 
placebo in mean percent change of mammographic breast density from baseline with slight decreases in all 
groups,  while  breast  density  increased  in  the  CE/MPA  group.  As  regards  quality  of  sleep  BZA/CE  20 mg  / 
0.625 mg appeared to be effective on more items in the MOS sleep scale than 20 mg / 0.45 mg. The MENQOL 
analysis showed some improvements compared to placebo, these appear to be more pronounced with higher 
doses of CE. 
In summary, endometrial safety can currently not be concluded based on study 3307. As regards treatment of 
postmenopausal  osteoporosis  the  investigated  doses  of  BZA/CE  of  20 mg  /  0.45 mg  and  20 mg  /  0.625 mg 
appear not to have an advantage over the active comparators BZA 20 mg and CE/MPA; changes in BMD were

not  statistically  significant  between  BZA  monotherapy,  BZA/CE,  and  CE/MPA  groups,  but  effects  were  most 
pronounced with CE/MPA. These results, in conjunction with the efficacy data seen in study 303, question the 
suitability  of  the  proposed  fixed  dose  combination  of  BZA  with  CE  for  the  treatment  of  postmenopausal 
osteoporosis.

Supportive studies 
Study 300 
Study  300  has  already  been  assessed  in  the  BZA  monotherapy  programme  (see:  EPAR  Conbriza 
EMEA/H/C/000913). It was a 5-arm, outpatient, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo- and raloxifene 
controlled study in postmenopausal women and examined the effect of bazedoxifene 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg 
as  well  as  raloxifene  60 mg  and  placebo  on  BMD  over  a  period  of  up  to  24  months.  It  was  designed  as  an 
“osteoporosis prevention” trial, with inclusion criteria and primary endpoint considered to be in line with Revision 
1 of the CHMP Guideline on Osteoporosis. 
BMD  was preserved in BZA 20 mg and raloxifene 60 mg-treated subjects, while significant loss in BMD  was 
observed in patients receiving placebo. The increase in LS BMD with BZA 20 mg and raloxifene 60 mg, compared 
with placebo, was significant at 6 months (1.14% and 1.26%, respectively) and was maintained through 2 years 
(1.41% and 1.49%, respectively). The effect of BZA on BMD at other skeletal sites was similar. 
Study 301 
Study  301  as  well  has  already  been  assessed  in  the  BZA  monotherapy  programme  (see:  EPAR  Conbriza 
EMEA/H/C/000913). It was a 4-arm, outpatient, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo- and raloxifene 
controlled study over 3 years in postmenopausal osteoporotic women. Treatment groups included BZA 20 mg 
and  40 mg,  raloxifene  60 mg,  and  placebo.  It  was  considered  the  main  pivotal  trial  for  the  monotherapy 
programme. Inclusion and exclusion criteria and primary endpoint were mainly in line with Revision 1 of the 
CHMP Guideline on Osteoporosis and scientific advice received by the Applicant with the exception of exclusion 
of women with a very high risk of osteoporotic fractures. According to the Applicant this was due to ethical 
considerations  regarding  the  placebo-control  included  in  this  study,  which  was  considered  to  be  a  valid 
argument. The study evaluated the incidence of new vertebral fractures over 3 years in the core study with two 
2-year  double-blind,  placebo  controlled  extensions.  The  BZA  40 mg  dose  was  decreased  to  20 mg  after 
approximately 4 years. The raloxifene group was discontinued during the first 2-year extension.  
Overall there was a significant reduction in the incidence of new vertebral fractures after 3 years of treatment 
with BZA 20 mg and raloxifene 60 mg compared to placebo. The reduction in the incidence of vertebral fracture 
was similar among BZA and raloxifene groups. The treatment effect was similar among those with and without 
prevalent vertebral fractures. After 5 years of treatment the incidence of new vertebral fractures remained lower 
in the BZA 20 mg group (4.49%) compared to placebo (6.82%) with a relative risk reduction of 36% (p=0.014). 
After 7 years of treatment, the incidence of new vertebral fractures remained lower in the BZA 20 mg group 
(7.64%) compared to placebo (9.90%) with a relative risk reduction of 30% (p=0.022). 
The  incidence  of  non-vertebral  osteoporosis-related  fractures  was  similar  among  BZA  20 mg  (5.68%), 
raloxifene 60 mg (5.87%), and placebo (6.26%) groups. In a post-hoc analysis, the 10-year fracture probability 
as  an  index  of  baseline  fracture  risk  was  determined.  The  mean  10-year  fracture  probability  of  a  major 
osteoporotic fracture for the entire study population was 11%. In subjects treated with BZA, the incidence of 
fractures was related to the baseline fracture risk: the higher the fracture risk, the greater the benefit with BZA 
treatment.  In  subjects  with  10-year  fracture  probabilities  at  or  above  16%,  BZA  was  associated  with  a 
significant decrease in the risk of all clinical fractures. In a post-hoc analysis, the relative risk of non-vertebral 
fractures  in  BZA-treated  subjects  decreased  with  increased  fracture  probability.  In  subjects  with  a  fracture 
probability  of  20%  or  greater  (n  =  618)  the  risk  of  non-vertebral  fractures  in  BZA-treated  subjects  was 
decreased by 55% (95% CI: 18-76) compared to placebo-treated subjects.

The  increase  in  LS  BMD  compared  with  placebo  with  BZA  20 mg  and  raloxifene  60 mg  was  significant  at  6 
months  (1.02%  and  1.29%,  respectively)  and  was  maintained  through  3  years  (1.32%  and  2.08%, 
respectively). The effect of BZA on BMD at other skeletal sites was similar. The increases in BMD relative to 
placebo remained statistically significant at all skeletal sites throughout the 5 years of treatment with BZA. After 
7 years of treatment with BZA the increases in BMD relative to placebo remained statistically significant at the 
femoral neck, femoral trochanter, and total hip. The increase from baseline in lumbar spine BMD at 7 years in 
the BZA 20 mg group was not statistically greater than in the placebo group. 
Study 304 
Study 304 ‘A double-blind, randomised, placebo- and active-controlled efficacy and safety study of bazedoxifene 
/ conjugated oestrogens combinations for prevention of endometrial hyperplasia and prevention of osteoporosis 
in  postmenopausal  women’  was  an  outpatient,  multicentre,  double-blind,  randomised,  4-parallel-group, 
placebo-  and  active-controlled  (CE/MPA  0.45 mg/1.5 mg)  study  in  non-hysterectomised  postmenopausal 
women designed to assess the effect of BZA/CE 20 mg / 0.45 mg and 20 mg / 0.625 mg on the incidence of 
endometrial  hyperplasia  and  efficacy  in  preventing  postmenopausal  osteoporosis  after  1 year  of  therapy, 
conducted between October 2005 and August 2007.  
Study 304 is considered as supportive only as the formulations of BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg and BZA 20 mg / CE 
0.625 mg  administered  in  this  study  were  not  bioequivalent  to  the  BZA/CE  formulations  used  in  study  303 
(geometric mean ratio of 82% for AUC, 90% CI 75% - 90%). 
The study enrolled healthy, postmenopausal, non-hysterectomised women aged 40 to <65 years. 
Before data were analysed the protocol of the original 1-year study (CSR 68285) was amended to add a 1-year 
extension study (CSR-73414). Not all subjects participating in the original study were eligible for the extension 
since the amendment was implemented after some subjects had already completed and not all sites participated 
in the extension. Participants in the BZA/CE groups initially received Formulation B and were later switched to 
Formulation C. Data from bioequivalence studies performed showed that Formulation C is not bioequivalent to 
Formulations A and B and thus data from trial 304 are considered supportive only. 
The Primary objectives were to assess the effect of BZA/CE on the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia and in 
preventing  postmenopausal  osteoporosis  after  1  year  of  therapy.  Secondary  objectives  were  to  provide 
descriptive BMD data for BZA/CE versus the active comparator and to assess the effect on uterine bleeding or 
spotting and breast pain. The objective of the 1-year study extension was to obtain additional efficacy and safety 
data. 
The  primary  endpoints  were  the  incidence  of  endometrial  hyperplasia  at  Year  1  of  therapy  and  in  the 
osteoporosis  substudy  the  percent  change  from  baseline  in  BMD  of  lumbar  spine  after  1  year  of  therapy 
compared with placebo. Secondary endpoints were percent change from baseline in the BMD of lumbar spine at 
Month 24, percent change from baseline in the BMD of total hip, the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia at 
Month  24,  cumulative  and  noncumulative  amenorrhea,  bone  metabolism  markers,  and  breast  pain.  The 
numbers of subjects per group and study period are given in the table below.

At Year 2 in the study extension in the BZA/CE 20 mg / 0.45 mg group, the endometrial hyperplasia rate was 0% 
with an  upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of 2.78%, while in the 20 mg / 0.625 mg group the endometrial 
hyperplasia rate was 4.93% with an upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of 9.89%. In addition, after 2 years there 
were 2 cases of endometrial malignancy in the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg. 
It is noted that a decrease in bioavailability of BZA of about 20% for the formulations of BZA/CE used in this 
study, compared to the formulations used in study 303, considerably compromised the endometrial safety, at 
least regarding the higher dose. In addition, with respect to BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg, it appears questionable 
whether the number of subjects in the EE population is the population of subjects with evaluable biopsies as 
defined in the CHMP Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for hormone replacement therapy 
of oestrogen deficiency symptoms in postmenopausal women (EMEA/CHMP/021/97 Rev. 1, 13 October 2005). 
However, as this study is considered as supportive only, this issue is not further discussed. 
Changes  from  baseline  in  BMD  at  lumbar  spine  at  month  12  showed  significant  increases  for  both  doses 
compared  to  placebo,  but  were  significantly  lower  than  with  CE/MPA.  At  total  hip  changes  in  BMD  were 
comparable with the exception that the difference between CE/MPA and BZA/CE 20 mg / 0.625 mg was not 
statistically significant (p=0.057). Results from the 1 year study extension were in line with those from the main 
study, as were results of the responder analyses performed. In conclusion data from trial 304 indicate that the 
anti-osteoporotic efficacy of both BZA/CE fixed combinations used in this trial was inferior to that seen with 
CE/MPA 0.45 mg/1.5 mg. Overall changes in markers of bone turnover were in line with changes seen in BMD. 
The cumulative rate of amenorrhea was higher in both BZA/CE groups than in the CE/MPA group at all time 
periods. There were no significant differences in the percentages of subjects reporting at least 1 day of breast 
pain between BZA/CE groups and placebo, while these were significantly higher in the CE/MPA versus placebo at 
most time points.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study 203 was a phase 2, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, controlled, dose finding study of BZA paired 
with CE on the estrogenic stimulation of the endometrium in healthy postmenopausal women conducted in the 
EU.  Eleven  (11)  dose  groups  were  studied:  doses  of  5 mg,  10 mg,  and  20 mg  BZA  were  studied  each  in 
combination with 0.45 mg CE and 0.626 mg CE; 0.3 mg, 0.625 mg CE monotherapy; 0.625 mg CE / 2.5 mg 
MPA and placebo. Patients were treated for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was endometrial thickness 
measured by TVUS at day 84. Secondary endpoints included change from baseline in the number of subjects 
presenting oestrogen related changes in the endometrium (glands and stroma), endpoints related to VMS and 
VVA, bleeding / spotting, and breast tenderness. 
Study  303  investigated  six  (6)  fixed  dose  combinations  of  BZA/CE,  BZA  10,  20,  and  40 mg,  each  in 
combination  with  either  0.625 mg  or  0.45 mg  CE;  it  included  2  osteoporosis  substudies.  The  rate  of 
discontinuation was comparable between groups. For the primary analysis only 73% in the placebo and 77% 
and 76% in the BZA/CE 20 mg / 0.45 mg and 20 mg / 0.625 mg groups, respectively, have been included. The 
rate of protocol violations leading to discontinuation was low. Protocol deviations occurred, but these appear to 
have been adequately addressed and dealt with by the Applicant. It is agreed that no major impact on study 
results are to be expected.  
Overall, there were no significant differences among groups regarding baseline characteristics. However, the 
population  consisted  of  mainly  younger  postmenopausal  women  and  the  number  of  women  with  other than 
white ethnicity is sparse. Importantly, study 303 was classified as GCP non-compliant. 
Study  305 was a Phase 3, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, 3-parallel-group, placebo-controlled study 
designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg and BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg for the 
treatment of VMS (oestrogen deficiency symptom indication). The study was conducted in the USA. In brief, the 
study enrolled generally healthy postmenopausal women with an intact uterus, aged 40 to 65 years, seeking 
treatment for hot flushes and reporting at screening a minimum of 7 moderate to severe hot flushes per day or 
50 per week. The treatment duration was 12 weeks. The primary objective was to assess the safety and efficacy 
of 2 doses of BZA/CE  compared with placebo for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS associated with 
menopause. The secondary objectives were to assess the effect of BZA/CE on breast pain and to assess the 
results  from  the  Medical  Outcomes  Study  (MOS)  sleep  scale.  An  active  comparator  was  unfortunately  not 
included. 
With regard to the conduct of the study, it is noted that in a GCP inspection the study was classified as GCP 
non-compliant.  Nevertheless,  the  data  regarding  efficacy  of  BZA/CE  in  the  treatment  of  hot  flushes  were 
correctly  reported  and  in  particular  the  MITT  analyses  regarding  hot  flushes  can  be  taken  into  account  for 
assessment of BZA/CE. 
Study  306 was a Phase 3, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, outpatient, 4-parallel-group placebo- and 
active-controlled  study  designed  to  assess  the  efficacy  of  BZA  20 mg  /  CE  0.45 mg  and  BZA  20 mg  /  CE 
0.625 mg compared with placebo and BZA 20 mg for the treatment of VVA. The study was conducted in the USA. 
Generally healthy postmenopausal women, 40 to 65 years of age, with an intact uterus and  with signs and 
symptoms of VVA were enrolled. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg, BZA 
20 mg / CE 0.625 mg, BZA 20 mg, or placebo. The treatment duration was 12 weeks. The co-primary endpoints 
for vulvar / vaginal atrophy were the increase in superficial cells, decrease in parabasal cells, lowering of vaginal 
pH, and improvement in the most bothersome symptom at week 12. Secondary efficacy endpoints included 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/383987/2014 
Page 100/153 
  
  
 
 
further  endpoints  related  to  vaginal  smear  and  symptoms  of  VVA,  including  a  responder  analysis,  with 
responders defined as subjects who had 1 or more of the following at the week 12 (LOCF) evaluation: vaginal 
superficial cells > 5%, vaginal pH <5, or improvement of their Most Bothersome Symptom by at least 1 category 
from  baseline.  Other  secondary  efficacy  variables  included  the  self-administered  questionnaires  (ASEX, 
MENQOL,  MS-TSQ).  Diaries  were  used  to  capture  intake  of  medication  and  symptoms  /  complaints.  For  all 
efficacy  variables  except  for  MS-TSQ,  the  primary  efficacy  population  was  the  modified-intent-to-treat 
population  (MITT),  defined  as  all  subjects  who  were  randomised,  took  at  least  1  dose  of  test  article,  had  a 
baseline value, and had at least 1 on-therapy value for the parameter being analysed, using an LOCF approach. 
Study 3307 consisted of a main study and included 3 substudies (osteoporosis (OSS), sleep, breast density). 
The  study  included  healthy,  postmenopausal  female  subjects  aged  between  40  to  65  years.  Participants 
received  BZA/CE  20 mg  /  0.45 mg,  BZA/CE  20 mg  /  0.625 mg,  BZA  20 mg,  CE/MPA  0.45 mg  /  1.5 mg,  or 
placebo. The rate of discontinuation was not comparable between groups. For the overall analysis, the rate of 
discontinuation  was  about  28%  in  the  CE/MPA  group,  versus  about  20%  in  all  other  groups  except  BZA/CE 
20 mg / 0.625 mg (about 17%). These differences were even more pronounced in the osteoporosis substudy. 
Rates  ranged  from  about  15%  in  the  BZA/CE  20 mg  /  0.625 mg  to  27%  in  the  CE/MPA  group;  about  25% 
discontinued  in  the  BZA  20 mg  monotherapy  group.  For  the  interpretation  of  the  BMD  data  a  conservative 
approach was used for the primary analysis of these data (LOCF) and a set of sensitivity analyses (BOCF, MMRM, 
CDC, JC) was consistent with the primary analysis, indicating that the differential drop-out rates across groups 
have no significant influence on the evaluation of the BMD efficacy results. For the primary analysis only 75% in 
the placebo and 75% and 78% in the BZA/CE 20 mg / 0.45 mg and 20 mg / 0.625 mg groups, respectively, 
have been included. The percent of women included was even lower in the CE/MPA group with 68%. Protocol 
deviations occurred, but these appear to have been adequately addressed and dealt with by the Applicant. It is 
agreed that no major impact on study results is to be expected. Overall, there were no significant differences 
among groups regarding baseline characteristics. However, the population investigated was even younger than 
in trial 303 and the number of women with other than white ethnicity again is low. 
Efficacy 
Oestrogen Deficiency Symptoms 
VMS 
In dose-finding study 203 it was observed that CE 0.3 mg was statistically significantly superior to placebo only 
in combination with 5 mg BZA, but not with 10 mg or 20 mg BZA. A dose of 0.3 mg CE was not further studied 
in phase 3 studies. CE 0.625 mg in combination with 5 mg, 10 mg, or 20 mg BZA was statistically significantly 
superior to placebo regarding VMS. No statistically significant differences with respect to number and severity of 
hot flushes were observed between the different combinations of BZA/CE, compared with the same doses of CE 
as  monotherapy.  However,  numerically  the  effects  were  somewhat  greater  in  the  CE  monotherapy  groups 
except for the comparison BZA 5 mg / CE 0.3 mg vs. CE 0.3 mg. For CE 0.625 mg / BZA 5 mg, CE 0.625 mg / 
BZA 10 mg and 20 mg, no statistically significant differences with respect to number and severity of hot flushes 
were observed vs. CE 0.625 / 2.5 mg MPA. However, numerically, the effects were somewhat greater in the 
CE/MPA group. 
In study 305, the pivotal study regarding VMS, statistically significant superiority of BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg 
and of BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg vs. placebo was shown with respect to the co-primary endpoints change from 
baseline in the average daily number of moderate and severe hot flushes at week 4 and week 12 and change 
from baseline in the average daily severity score of hot flushes at week 4 and 12. At week 12 the mean change 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/383987/2014 
Page 101/153 
  
  
 
 
from baseline in the average daily number of moderate and severe hot flushes was -7.63, -8.05, and -4.92 in the 
BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg, the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg, and the placebo group, respectively. At week 12 the 
mean change from baseline in the average daily severity score of hot flushes was -0.87, -01.21, and -0.26 in the 
BZA  20 mg  /  CE  0.45 mg,  the  BZA  20 mg  /  CE  0.625 mg,  and  the  placebo  group,  respectively.  Regarding 
secondary  endpoints  the  results  also  support  the  conclusion  that  both  dose  strengths  of  BZA/CE  are  more 
effective than placebo for hot flushes. 
The differences between BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg and BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg at week 12 with regard to 
number as well as severity of hot flushes were small. A formal comparison of the 2 dose strengths of BZA/CE 
regarding the primary endpoints had not been pre-specified. 
With regard to secondary endpoints statistically significantly more subjects experienced a 75% reduction from 
baseline in the number of moderate and severe hot flushes at week 4 and 12 in the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg 
group  (53.60%  and  72.80%,  respectively)  compared  to  BZA  20 mg  /  CE  0.45 mg  (39.34%  and  60.66%, 
respectively).  Regarding  other  secondary  endpoints  such  as  subjects  with  ≥50%  decrease  in  average  daily 
number of hot flushes at week 12 vasomotor function domain of MENQOL, median time to 3 consecutive days of 
50% reduction from baseline, and sleep-related endpoints the results were mostly very similar in the BZA 20 mg 
/ CE 0.45 mg and the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg group. No CE/progestin control group was included in this 
study. 
Study 303, was classified as GCP non-compliant and is not taken into account for the assessment of efficacy of 
BZA/CE in the treatment of hot flushes. 
VVA 
In study 203, with regard to CE 0.3 mg the effect on VMI appeared to be highest in the CE 0.3 mg monotherapy 
group and decreased numerically with increasing BZA doses. With regard to CE 0.625 mg, similar effects were 
observed in all BZA/CE groups and the CE 0.625 mg monotherapy group while the effect in the placebo group 
appeared to be lower. It is also noted that the effect on the VMI appeared to be higher with CE 0.625 mg / MPA 
2.5 mg,  compared  to  all  combinations  of  BZA/CE.  Statistical  significance  was  not  tested  regarding  these 
comparisons. 
In study 306, the pivotal study regarding VVA, statistically significant differences favouring BZA 20 mg / CE 
0.625 mg  vs.  placebo  were  found  with  regard  to  all  4  co-primary  endpoints  increase  in  superficial  cells  and 
decrease in parabasal cells, decrease in vaginal ph, and improvement in MBS at week 12. Regarding BZA 20 mg 
/ CE 0.45 mg the differences vs. placebo at week 12 were statistically significant only regarding superficial and 
parabasal cells, not regarding vaginal pH and MBS. For BZA alone, differences vs. placebo were not statistically 
significant regarding superficial cells, vaginal ph, and MBS while regarding parabasal cells even a significant 
increase vs. baseline was observed. No CE/progestin control group was included in this study. 
The  investigation  of  VVA  is  acknowledged  as  additional  evidence  in  the  oestrogen  deficiency  symptoms 
indication, although not mandatory according to European guidance. It is also noted that also in this study, no 
CE / progestin control group was included. 
Study 303 was classified as GCP non-compliant and should not be taken into account for the assessment of 
efficacy of BZA/CE in the treatment of VVA.

Treatment of Osteoporosis 
Data on surrogate parameters of postmenopausal osteoporosis were collected in substudies of pivotal trials 303 
and 3307 only; they evaluated effects on BMD for the prevention of osteoporosis as main secondary endpoint. 
Study 303 included 2 osteoporosis substudies, while Study 3307 included 1 osteoporosis substudy. Women in 
the Substudy I of Study 303 had to be >5 years postmenopausal, have a BMD T-score at the lumbar spine or 
total hip between -1 and -2.5 (inclusive), and have at least 1 risk factor for osteoporosis; those in the Substudy 
II had to be at least 1 year and ≤5 years postmenopausal and have at least 1 risk factor for osteoporosis. The 
osteoporosis  substudy  of  Study  3307  had  similar  requirements  for  inclusion  and  exclusion  as  Study  303 
Substudy II. 
The Applicant initially designed the clinical programme for the prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal 
women  evaluated  by  improvements  in  BMD  and  changes  in  BTMs  in  accordance  with  the  CHMP  Note  for 
Guidance on Postmenopausal Osteoporosis in Women, revision 1, effective from January 2001. This guideline 
has been revised during the clinical development programme; revision 2, effective since May 2007, does no 
longer have a specific prevention indication. However, prevention of osteoporosis is contained in the treatment 
indication since the goal of therapy is to prevent fractures. Since for both components of this fixed combination 
anti-fracture  efficacy  has  been  established,  BMD  together  with  BTMs  are  considered  adequate  surrogate 
markers.  
Study 303 was classified as GCP non-compliant and should not be taken into account for the assessment of 
efficacy of BZA/CE as regards osteoporosis. The MITT analysis of the main secondary endpoint mean percent 
change from baseline in BMD of the lumbar spine after 2 years of therapy showed significant increases in lumbar 
spine BMD from baseline to month 24 in both substudies (women >5 and ≤5 years postmenopausal) for all 
groups  except  placebo  were  BMD  values  decreased.  All  groups  with  BZA/CE  had  mean  percent  changes  in 
lumbar spine BMD from baseline to month 24 significantly different from placebo. Independent of the dose of CE 
the effect was most pronounced with the lowest dose of 10 mg BZA, attenuating with increasing dose of BZA. 
This  trend  was  also  seen  in  BMD  of  total  hip  and  the  other  hip  areas.  In  the  group  of  women  >5  years 
postmenopausal effects were more pronounced with BZA/CE containing either 10 or 20 mg BZA, but not 40 mg, 
compared to raloxifene 60 mg; in women ≤5 years postmenopausal BMD increases were more pronounced with 
all doses of BZA/CE. However, results were only marginally significant for BZA/CE 20 mg / 0.45 mg in the elder 
women and for BZA 40 mg / CE in younger women. The responder analysis was in line with these findings; in 
both substudies, consistent with the primary analysis, responder rates tended to be higher with higher doses of 
conjugated oestrogens and lower doses of BZA. Thus, in general higher doses of CEs induced larger increases in 
BMD, while increases in the BZA dosage attenuated the effects of CEs. As regards changes in BMD the results 
clearly favour the BZA 10 mg dose groups. Nevertheless for BZA/CE combinations containing 20 mg of BZA 
effects  on  BMD  at  lumbar  spine  were  more  pronounced  than  with  raloxifene  60 mg  while  in  the  BZA 
monotherapy clinical programme, effects of BZA 20 mg on BMD were comparable to that seen with raloxifene 
60 mg (EPAR Conbriza 2009). 
Study 3307 is the only clinical trial with valid data as regards osteoporosis. In the osteoporosis substudy in 
postmenopausal women with a baseline T-score ≥-2.5 both BZA/CE groups showed a significant increase in 
lumbar spine and total hip BMD compared with decreases observed in the placebo group after 1 year of therapy. 
For both BZA/CE doses there were significant increases in mean percent change from baseline in BMD of lumbar 
spine  at  Month  12  and  Month  6  (secondary)  compared  to  placebo  as  well  as  in  total  hip  BMD  at  Month  12. 
Changes in BMD were not statistically significant between BZA monotherapy, BZA/CE, and CE/MPA groups, but 
effects  were  most  pronounced  with  CE/MPA.  The  non-inferiority  analysis  for  BMD  showed  non-inferiority  of 
Assessment report

BZA/CE  20 mg  /  0.625 mg  to  BZA  20 mg  but  no  superiority,  whilst  BZA/CE  20 mg  /  0.45 mg  failed  the 
pre-specified  non-inferiority  criterion  in  comparison  to  BZA  monotherapy.  Findings  in  the  analysis  of  bone 
turnover markers were in line with the observed changes in BMD. 
Overall there was no additive or synergistic effect on skeletal endpoints of the fixed combination of BZA with 
CEs.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Oestrogen Deficiency Symptoms 
Vasomotor symptoms are considered as the most important oestrogen deficiency symptoms in accordance with 
Guideline  on  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal  products  for  hormone  replacement  therapy  of  oestrogen 
deficiency  symptoms  in  postmenopausal  women  (EMEA/CHMP/021/97  rev.  1,  13 Oct  2005).  The  current 
standard  therapy  is  systemic  administration  of  an  oestrogen  in  hysterectomised  patients  and  an  oestrogen 
combined  with  a  progestin  in  non-hysterectomised  patients.  In  addition  VVA  also  occurs  in  postmenopausal 
women. However, if treatment is intended for VVA only the treatment option of choice is topical oestrogen. 
In  the  therapeutic  indication  treatment  of  oestrogen  deficiency  syndrome  in  postmenopausal  women  with  a 
uterus  BZA  is  intended  for  endometrial  protection  as  oestrogens  alone  increase  the  risk  of  endometrial 
carcinoma  in  non-hysterectomised  patients.  Usually,  in  this  population  an  oestrogen  is  combined  with  a 
progestin for endometrial safety. This is the first application submitted in the centralised procedure in the EU for 
a fixed combination of an oestrogen and a SERM. 
Both  dose  strengths  of  BZA/CE  initially  applied  for  are  statistically  significantly  superior  to  placebo  in  the 
treatment of hot flushes. Based on the available data regarding treatment of hot flushes from the phase 2 study 
203, the phase 3 study 3307, and a historical comparison vs. the HOPE study investigating different dosages of 
CE and CE/MPA it is concluded that the efficacy of CE in this regard is decreased in the combination BZA/CE 
compared to the combination CE/MPA. This decrease cannot be quantified as unfortunately a CE/MPA active 
control group was not included in study 305 which is considered as pivotal with respect to treatment of hot 
flushes. The Applicant argues that the decrease in efficacy is outweighed by better tolerability in terms of less 
breast pain, a more favourable bleeding pattern, and lack of effect on mammographic breast density.  
Comparisons  of  the  effects  of  the  2  dose  strengths  of  BZA/CE  initially  applied  for  on  hot  flushes  were  not 
prespecified in the submitted studies. In the pivotal study 305, the results regarding number of  hot flushes 
which is the recommended primary endpoint according to the CHMP HRT Guideline (EMEA/CHMP/021/97 Rev. 1, 
13  October  2005)  were  similar  with  the  two  dosages.  Regarding  the  co-primary  endpoint  “severity  of  hot 
flushes” the difference between the two dosages was numerically small. With regard to secondary endpoints 
some  statistical  significant  differences  favouring  the  higher  dose,  e.g.  regarding  75%  responder  rate,  were 
noted, while regarding other secondary endpoints such as vasomotor function scale of MENQOL, median time to 
3 consecutive days of 50% reduction from baseline, or sleep outcomes the results were largely similar with the 
two doses. Thus, an increased efficacy of BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg compared to BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg was 
not demonstrated in the pivotal study. 
With regard to VVA statistically significant differences vs. placebo were shown for BZA 20 / CE 0.45 mg only 
regarding increase in superficial cells and decrease in parabasal cells, not regarding vaginal pH and the most 
bothersome symptom. For BZA 20 / CE 0.625 mg statistically significant differences vs. placebo were shown 
with regards to all these 4 co-primary endpoints. Regarding treatment of VVA there is a consensus that topical 
Assessment report

low dose oestrogens should be used (see e.g. de Villiers TJ et al.: Global consensus statement on menopausal 
hormone therapy. Climacteric 2013; 16: 203-204; Panay N et al.: The 2013 British Menopause Society and 
Women´s  Health  Concern  recommendations  on  hormone  replacement  therapy.  Menopause  Int  19;  2013: 
59-68). Topical oestrogens have proven efficacious for VVA and are associated with lower systemic exposure as 
compared to oestrogens. Thus, with regard to the therapeutic indication “oestrogen deficiency symptoms in 
postmenopausal women”, efficacy of BZA/CE in the treatment of VMS is of primary interest. 
In summary with regard to hot flushes, the endpoint of primary interest, efficacy of both dose strengths initially 
applied for vs. placebo was shown. However, the available data indicate that the efficacy of CE in the treatment 
of oestrogen deficiency syndrome is decreased in the combination BZA/CE compared to CE/MPA. In addition, 
superior efficacy of the higher dose strength BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg compared to the lower dose BZA 20 mg 
/ CE 0.45 mg has not been demonstrated. Consequently, the Applicant has withdrawn the higher dose strength 
BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg from the current application. 
Treatment of Osteoporosis 
Generally higher doses of CEs induced larger increases in BMD while increases in the BZA dosage attenuated the 
effects of CEs. As regards changes in BMD the results clearly favour the BZA 10 mg dose groups. Nevertheless, 
for BZA/CE combinations containing 20 mg of BZA effects on BMD at lumbar spine were more pronounced than 
with raloxifene 60 mg while in the BZA monotherapy clinical programme, effects of BZA 20 mg on BMD were 
comparable to that seen with raloxifene 60 mg (EPAR Conbriza EMEA/H/C/000913). However, these results are 
based on study 303 which was classified as GCP non-compliant and should therefore not be taken into account 
for the assessment of efficacy of BZA/CE. 
For the investigated doses of BZA/CE 20 mg / 0.45 mg and 20 mg / 0.625 mg no additive or synergistic effect 
on skeletal endpoints of the FDC over the active comparators BZA 20 mg and CE/MPA has been shown in trial 
3307; changes in BMD were not statistically significant between BZA monotherapy, BZA/CE, and CE/MPA groups, 
but effects were most pronounced with CE/MPA. It should be taken into account that the data for the active 
comparator CE/MPA are limited to the lower possible dose of CE of 0.45 mg instead of 0.625 mg. This dose is not 
licensed in some member states of the EU. Data on a direct comparison with CE/MPA containing 0.625 mg have 
not been provided, but even more pronounced effects on BMD might be expected with this combination. In a 
FDC  both  components  should  contribute  to  the  effect  of  the  combination  but  the  doses  of  BZA/CE  20 mg  / 
0.45 mg  and  20 mg  /  0.625 mg  did  not  appear  to  be  more  efficacious  compared  to  monotherapy  with  BZA 
20 mg or CE/MPA.  
In conclusion, the added value of the FDC over the mono-components for the proposed indication of treatment 
of osteoporosis, even considering proposed revised wording during the procedure, has not been shown and is 
lacking adequate justification. The required long-term treatment for this indication is not considered to be in line 
with  the  Core  SmPC  for  Hormone  Replacement  Therapy  products.  Furthermore  results  are  only  based  on 
substudies of the clinical trials 303 and 3307; these substudies are not considered pivotal. In addition, study 303 
was classified as GCP non-compliant and should not be taken into account for the assessment of efficacy of 
BZA/CE leaving only 1 trial delivering valid data for the assessment of efficacy of the BZA/CE in osteoporosis. In 
consequence the Applicant has withdrawn the osteoporosis treatment claim from the current procedure.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
The  safety  analysis  is  based  on  data  of  the  five  Phase  3  studies  3115A1-303-US/EU/BR,  3115A1-304-WW, 
3115A1-305-US, 3115A1-306-WW, and 3115A1-3307-WW as well as additional supportive data from Phase 1 
and Phase 2 studies. This includes 20 Phase 1 studies all of which were conducted in healthy postmenopausal 
women and a single Phase 2 study (Study 203) in healthy postmenopausal women experiencing moderate to 
severe VMS.  
Patient exposure 
The safety population consisted of all subjects who were randomly assigned and received at least 1 dose of test 
article. For the safety analyses the overall safety population including all data up to 2-years of treatment was 
comprised of all subjects enrolled in the 5 Phase 3 studies 303, 304, 305, 306, and 3307. Details of the five 
different study groupings provided by the Applicant and the exposure per group is given in the following table.

Overall, more than 1,000 women have been exposed to the fixed dose combinations of BZA/CE with 20 mg BZA 
for more than 1 year and more than 850 have been exposed for 2 years. Data for the fixed dose combination are 
sparse beyond 2 years of exposure except for BZA monotherapy where data for up to 7 years are available. 
Adverse events 
A full picture over the safety of the BZA/CE combinations was hampered by the Applicant’s data presentation in 
the Clinical Overview and Summary of Clinical Safety which only included comparisons with placebo given that 
the dossier contains 3 studies with active comparators, namely studies 306 (BZA), 303 (raloxifene), and 3307 
(CE/MPA and BZA). The evaluation of the safety therefore focused on the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg and BZA

The AE profile for the Studies 305 and 306 combined was similar to the overall AE data from the integrated 3 
months treatment duration data as well as for the VMS subpopulation (Study 305, Study 303 subpopulation) for 
all time points. 
Treatment-emergent adverse events 
The analysis of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) included the active phase of the study from the first 
dose of double-blind therapy through 30 days after the last dose of study medication. 
According to the original dossier about 3 to 4% of women experienced treatment emergent adverse events 
considered  severe  and  related  to  therapy  by  the  investigators;  there  were  no  clear  pattern  or  significant 
differences  in  treatment  emergent  adverse  events  between  groups.  However,  the  GCP  inspection  findings 
clearly indicated that the relatedness of AEs has not adequately been assessed and that there is considerable 
underreporting in this regard. Therefore the Applicant was asked to provide updated overall numbers of adverse 
events considered to be related, using a most conservative approach in reassessing relatedness. It was agreed 
that the Applicant has taken a sufficiently conservative approach to report the safety profile in the proposed 
Assessment report

will be considered in the benefit-risk evaluation.

Classifications of adverse events are based on the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  
a. Totals for the number of Subjects at a higher level are not necessarily the sum of those at the lower levels since a subject may report two or 
more different adverse events within the higher level category.  
b. For each subject, adverse events are reported for the highest drug relationship within the highest severity (first priority) observed.

Adverse events of special interest 
Because  of  the  known  SERM  and  CE  class  effects  relevant  AEs  have  been  analysed;  this  included  venous 
thromboembolic  events  (VTE),  cardiovascular  (CHD)  events,  cerebrovascular  accidents  (CVAs),  and 
malignancies.  Post-hoc  an  independent  adjudication  committee  was  initialised  to  review  the  AEs  of  special 
interest VTEs, CHD, and CVA.  
The Applicant chose to use a meta-analytic approach to summarise these safety events. Incidence rates, rate 
differences,  and  relative  risk  versus  placebo  were  first  calculated  for  each  study,  then  the  incidence  rates, 
differences in rate versus placebo, and relative rates were summarised across studies using an inverse variance 
approach, which resulted in a different weight for each study and endpoint. Poisson variance was selected for 
weighting based on large differences in study duration. To allow inclusion of the studies with no events, the 
number of such events was inflated by 0.5 events. Results are presented as incidence rates, risk differences, and 
relative risks. The 95% CIs presented are ‘nominal’ without adjustment for multiple comparisons. 
Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTE) 
VTEs were defined as any venous thrombosis involving a deep peripheral vein (DVT), any pulmonary embolus, 
or any other serious vein thrombosis (e.g. retinal vein thrombosis).  
The number of women exposed and the number of events per group do not allow to assess differences per group. 
The absolute number of events in the clinical trial for this marketing application was 3 events in the BZ/CE 20 mg 
/ 0.45 mg and none in the 20 mg / 0.625 mg group. The issue has to be followed post-authorisation.   
Details on the incidence rates, risk differences and relative risks of VTEs as well as a comparison to historical 
data from the WHI trial are shown in the tables below.

Source:  2.7.4, BZA/CE Summary of Clinical Safety, Table 2-23.   
Since VTE is considered a known risk for BZA as well as CE, the Applicant has identified VTE as an important 
identified risk in the RMP and is proposing the addition of VTE as a Warning in the PI as well as a contraindication 
for  women  with  “Active  or  past  history  of  venous  thromboembolism  (deep  venous  thrombosis,  pulmonary 
embolism, and retinal vein thrombosis)”.   
Cardiac Adverse Events 
Based on the number of women exposed, the duration of treatment, and the lack of data in elderly women the 
available data do not allow to assess whether the risk of cardiac events for women treated with BZA 20 mg / CE 
compared to placebo or to historical data for CE/MPA from the WHI trial is increased. While a possible increase 
in the incidence of cardiac events for women treated with CE/MPA has been identified, the data provided for the 
registration  of  bazedoxifene  monotherapy  did  not  demonstrate  an  increased  risk  with  either  BZA  20 mg  or 
40 mg compared to placebo. The issue is reflected as an important potential risk in the RMP. 
Cerebrovascular Events 
Based on the number of women exposed, the duration of treatment, and the lack of data in elderly women the 
provided data do not allow to assess whether the incidence of cerebrovascular events for women treated with 
BZA  20 mg  /  CE  compared  to  placebo  or  to  historical  data  for  CE/MPA  from  the  WHI  trial  is  increased. 
Cerebrovascular AEs were not increased with BZA monotherapy (Studies 300 and 301), while in the CE-alone 
substudy of the WHI Study there was an increased risk of ischemic stroke due to hormone therapy compared to 
placebo. The issue was considered to be an important potential risk and included in the RMP.

Cancer 
Regarding the clinical trials investigating BZA/CE the duration of exposure is too short and the number of women 
exposed is too small to draw any conclusions regarding a possible risk of cancer, including breast cancer or 
ovarian cancer, associated with the fixed combination therapy of BZA 20 mg / CE.  
For BZA monotherapy an increased risk of breast cancer has not been reported based on the available data. 
CE/MPA combination therapy has been associated with an increase in the risk of breast cancer (Chlebowski RT 
et al.: JAMA 2003; 289: 3243-3253). CE alone did not increase the risk of breast cancer compared to placebo in 
the WHI study (Stefanick ML et al.: JAMA 2006; 295: 1647-1657) while an increase in breast cancer risk with 
oestrogen alone was observed in the Million Women Study (Million Women Study Collaborators: Lancet 2003; 
362:  419-427).  Thus,  data  regarding  the  risk  of  breast  cancer  associated  with  CE  monotherapy  are  not 
consistent. It should be noted that from the data available with respect to mammographic breast density in 
patients treated with BZA/CE, no conclusions regarding the risk of breast cancer can be drawn. The effect of 
BZA/CE on the risk of breast cancer is currently unknown and as such was included as important potential risk 
in the RMP. 
As regards endometrial cancer no increase in risk was reported with BZA monotherapy; based on the available 
data while for conjugated oestrogens the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma is increased when they 
are administered alone for prolonged periods. Endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer are included as 
important potential risks in the RMP of BZA/CE. 
Also in study 301 there were 5 cases of ovarian carcinoma with BZA 20 mg monotherapy versus no cases in the 
placebo group and 5 cases of thyroid cancer versus 1 case in the placebo group over the 7 years study period. 
No occurrence of ovarian cancer was reported for subjects in the BZA/CE 20 mg / 0.45 mg, 20 mg / 0.625 mg, 
or placebo groups. Ovarian cancer was reported in 2 of 4868 patients in all BZA/CE groups. Long-term use of 
oestrogen-only HRT is associated with a slightly increased risk of ovarian cancer. The effect of BZA/CE on the 
risk of ovarian cancer is currently unknown and hence included as important potential risk in the RMP. 
Based  on  the  available  data  overall  the  Applicant  proposed  to  predefine  breast  cancer,  ovarian  cancer, 
endometrial  cancer,  lung  cancer,  thyroid  cancer,  and  skin  cancer  as  potential  risks  in  the  RMP.  This  was 
endorsed.  
Gynaecological Safety 
In contrast to other safety analyses safety data from Study 304 have been excluded from the assessment of 
endometrial safety. This is acceptable since the bioavailability of BZA from the formulation used in trial 304 was 
reduced as compared to the TBM formulation and in combination with 0.625 mg CE no adequate endometrial 
protection was achieved. 
The following table presents the number and percentage of subjects who had AEs related to the endometrium 
excluding  cancer  reported  during  or  after  treatment  in  the  four  Phase  3  studies  303,  305,  306,  and  3307, 
excluding study 304 data.

It is noted that 1 case of endometrial malignancy was observed in the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg group of study 
303. It should also be noted that the treatment duration of 3 months in study 305 and 306 was not sufficient for 
the investigation of endometrial safety as per EMA Guideline on HRT.  
The  results  regarding  endometrial  thickness  measured  by  TVUS  from  study  3307  which  had  a  treatment 
duration  of  1  year,  are  displayed  below  (results  from  study  303  are  not  displayed  as  this  study  was  GCP 
non-compliant): 
Table 38: Mean Changes From Baseline in Transvaginal Ultrasonography Findings at Month 12 and Follow- up in

Page 114/153 
  
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
Thus, at month 12 statistical significant increases in endometrial thickness vs. baseline were reported in the BZA 
20 mg / CE 0.45 mg group, the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg group and the CE 0.45 mg / MPA 1.5 mg group. All 
these increases were statistically significantly higher compared to the change vs. baseline in the placebo group. 
Table 39: Number (%) of Subjects With Transvaginal Ultrasonography Results of Potential Clinical Importance 
(On-Therapy) up in study 3307 (from tab. 10-33 of the study report, p. 254) 
Statistical significance of the differences between each of the active treatment groups vs. placebo or between 
the different active treatment groups vs. each other was not tested. Numerically, the proportion of patients with 
TVUS findings of potential clinical importance regarding endometrial thickness results was higher in the BZA 
20 mg / CE 0.625 mg group and the CE 0.45 mg / MPA 1.5 mg group, compared to the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg 
and the placebo group. 
Ovarian volume was not adversely affected by BZA/CE 20 mg / 0.45 mg or 20 mg / 0.625 mg. The incidence of 
ovarian cysts was 6.8%, 9.1%, 10.6% and 12.0% in the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg group, the BZA 20 mg / CE 
0.625 mg group, the CE 0.45 mg / MPA 1.5 mg group and the placebo group, respectively, in study 3307. 
With regard to the bleeding pattern, the following results are available from study 3307: The percentage of 
subjects with amenorrhea from month 1 to 3 was 93.44%, 90.38%, 64.81%, and 92.13% in the BZA 20 mg / 
CE 0.45 mg group, the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg group, the CE 0.45 mg / MPA 1.5 mg group, and the placebo 
group, respectively. The percentage of subjects with amenorrhea from month 10 to 12 was 96.51%, 94.89%, 
79.17%, and 93.40% in the BZA 20 mg /  CE 0.45 mg group, the  BZA 20 mg /  CE 0.625 mg group, the CE 
0.45 mg / MPA 1.5 mg group and the placebo group, respectively. 
Thus, in the population included in study 3307 the bleeding pattern in the two BZA/CE groups was similar to 
placebo and more favourable compared to CE 0.45 mg / MPA 1.5 mg. However, it is noted that the dose of 
1.5 mg MPA is low and that no comparison of the products applied for vs. CE 0.625 mg / MPA 2.5 mg or CE 
0.625 mg  /  MPA  5 mg  was  provided.  In  addition  the  population  of  study  3307  was  not  selected  based on  a 
minimum frequency / severity of hot flushes and is therefore not identical with a population to be treated for 
VMA. 
Fractures 
Although differences are small adverse events of bone fracture occurred more often in patients treated with any 
combination of BZA and CE than with placebo. The Applicant provided additional analyses of the adverse events 
of bone fracture by summarising all potential osteoporotic fractures occurring ≥ 120 days after first dose of 
treatment  considering  the  bone  remodelling  cycle  of  approximately  120  days.  These  analyses  do  not  show 
clinically  relevant  differences  between  BZA/CE  groups  and  placebo.  When  further  subtracting  potentially 
traumatic fractures confirmed by review of patient narratives for each fracture potentially osteoporotic fractures 
were equally distributed across treatment groups.

Ocular Events 
Since there have been post-marketing reports of ocular events associated with BZA monotherapy ocular events 
have been specifically assessed. Treatment with a fixed combination of BZA/CE did not result in an increase in 
the incidence of ocular adverse events compared to placebo. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The analysis of deaths did not reveal an imbalance between groups. 
A consolidated presentation and discussion of serious adverse events occurring in the BZA/CE 20 mg / 0.45 mg 
and 20 mg / 0.625 mg versus both BZA 20 mg and CE/MPA was not included in the Summary of Clinical Safety 
but  contained  in  supportive  tables  in  the  annex  and  the  design  of  these  tables  was  not  considered  very

informative. However, the analysis of these data did not indicate relevant differences between active treatment 
groups as regards serious adverse events and thus no further information was requested. 
Overall  there  are  currently  no  significant  differences  identified  in  the  incidence  of  serious  adverse  events 
between BZA 20 mg / CE and placebo, although small imbalances with low absolute numbers occurred. Serious 
adverse  events  of  coronary  artery  disease,  chest  pain,  cholecystitis,  cholelithiasis,  abnormal  endometrium 
results, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischaemic attack, and deep vein thrombosis occurred more often 
with active treatment than with placebo.

Laboratory findings 
Treatment  with  BZA  20 mg  /  CE  had  no  clinically  relevant  influence  on  the  lipid  profile,  C-reactive  protein, 
plasma concentrations of homocysteine, mean fasting glucose levels, fasting insulin, parameters of liver or renal 
function, haemoglobin, haematocrit, or platelet counts, coagulation parameters, or thyroid stimulating hormone 
compared to placebo. Treatment with BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg and BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg was associated 
with an increase in serum triglycerides from baseline of approximately 16% and 20% at months 12 and 24, 
respectively; this is adequately reflected in the PI. Decreases from baseline in serum calcium, phosphorus, and 
alkaline phosphatase values were observed in all groups including placebo at all scheduled time points, but there 
were few occurrences of potentially clinically important decreases in calcium or phosphorus.  
With  respect  to  the  coagulation  system  the  Applicant  has  investigated  several  coagulation  parameters  to 
evaluate  potential  changes  that  might  result  in  a  higher  risk  for  thromboembolic  complications.  Currently 
available data about patients with abnormal coagulation laboratory results during on- and post-therapy time 
periods do not show an association of the thromboembolic risk with the changes observed in the parameters of 
coagulation  or  fibrinolysis.  Resistance  to  activated  protein  C  or  resistance  to  other  markers  for  venous 
thromboembolism have not been measured which has to be reflected in the uncertainty of the knowledge about 
the unfavourable effects. 
Vital Signs 
The available data do not indicate an influence of treatment with a fixed combination of BZA/CE compared to 
placebo on changes in vital signs or blood pressure. 
Safety in special populations 
No  clear  pattern  or  clinical  relevance  of  differences  in  adverse  events  in  special  populations  between  BZA 
20m mg / CE and placebo treated women has been seen in the data provided. However, the amount of data in 
the elderly as well as in women of other than white ethnicity is very limited and thus no definite conclusion as 
regards age and ethnicity can be drawn. “Use in elderly patients” was included as missing information in the 
RMP. 
Immunological events 
N/A 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug interaction studies were conducted with BZA/CE, which was considered acceptable. 
Discontinuation due to AEs 
The validity of the assessment of discontinuations due to AEs has been questioned for the investigated sites of 
study  303  in  the  GCP  inspection  report.  The  Applicant  has  therefore  provided  updated  analyses  of 
discontinuation due to AEs including analyses of relative frequencies calculated without data from investigator 
sites  447  and  450  of  trial  303  together  with  a  discussion  of  possible  differences  in  relative  frequencies  as 
requested. The Applicant has also conducted an additional analysis of AEs leading to discontinuation for the 
integrated data from all 5 Phase 3 studies (Studies 303, 304, 305, 306 and 3307) after excluding data from sites

447 and 450. The provided analyses do not indicate significant differences in the rates of discontinuation due to 
AEs re-analyses and the original analyses.

a Body system totals for the number of subjects are not necessarily the sum of the individual AEs, since a subject may report two or more 
different AEs in the same body system. Also, some of the preferred terms under the body system are not included in this table because 
of the cut-off used for this table (≥3 subjects in any treatment group). 
Overall P-value: Refers to No. of Subjects data. P-value for Chi-Square. 
Statistical significance at the .05, .01, .001 levels is denoted by *, **, *** respectively. 
Note: Two of the AEs listed in the text as differing significantly in incidence among the treatment groups (migraine and urticaria) are not 
included in this table because of the cut-off used for this table (≥3 subjects in any treatment group). 
Abbreviations: SGOT=Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (aspartate aminotransferase); SGPT=serum glutamic-pyruvic 
transaminase (alanine aminotransferase).

Post marketing experience 
Due to the late introduction of BZA into the market, post marketing exposure to BZA is low. The Applicant did not 
provide any information on the available extensive post marketing experience with CE.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The increased risks of administration of oestrogens in hysterectomised women and of oestrogen / progestin 
combination therapy in non-hysterectomised women, in particular during long-term treatment, are well-known, 
mainly based on the WHI studies and the Million Women Study. With oestrogens as well as oestrogen / progestin 
combination  therapy,  the  risk  of  VTE  is  increased  compared  to  placebo.  The  increase  in  risk  is  higher  with 
CE/MPA vs. placebo compared to CE vs. placebo (Cushman M et al.: JAMA 2004; 292: 1573-1580; Curb JD et al.: 
Arch Intern Med 2006; 166: 772-780). The risk of coronary artery disease is slightly increased with oestrogen 
/  progestin  combination  therapy  compared  to  placebo,  while  regarding  oestrogens  alone  no  increase  was 
observed (Manson JE et al.: NEJM 2003; 349: 523-534; Hsia J et al.: Arch Intern Med 2006; 166: 357-365). 
Both  oestrogens  alone  as  well  as  oestrogen  /  progestin  combination  therapy  are  associated  with  an  up  to 
1.5-fold increase in the risk of ischemic stroke (Wassertheil-Smoller S et al.: JAMA 2003; 289: 2673-2684; The 
Women’s health Initiative Steering Committee: JAMA 2004; 291: 1701.1712). Combined oestrogen-progestin 
therapy is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Regarding oestrogens alone no increased risk was 
reported in the WHI study while observational studies showed a small increase in risk (Chlebowski RT et al.: 
JAMA 2003; 289: 3243-3253; Stefanick ML et al.: JAMA 2006; 295: 1647-1657). The risk of ovarian cancer is 
slightly increased with oestrogen-only HRT and possibly also with oestrogen-progestin HRT. There is also some 
evidence that the risk of dementia is increased in women starting oestrogen-only or oestrogen / progestin HRT 
after the age of 65 years. Further adverse reactions of oestrogen / progestin HRT include gallbladder disease, 
erythema  nodosum,  and  erythema  multiforma.  All  these  increased  risks  regarding  oestrogens  alone  and  in 
combination with progestins are reflected in the CMDh Core SPC for hormone replacement therapy products, 
CMDh/131/2003/ Rev. 3, December 2009. 
The safety analysis of current application is mainly based on data of the five Phase 3 studies 303, 304, 305, 306, 
and 3307. Overall, 4868 women have been exposed to BZA/CE at any dose and 3168 women received BZA/CE 
doses with 20 mg of  BZA, 1585 BZA/CE 20 mg / 0.45 mg and 1583 20 mg /  0.625 mg, while 1241 women 
received placebo, 340 BZA 20 mg monotherapy, 423 raloxifene 60 mg, and 399 CE/MPA 0.45 mg / 1.5 mg. 
Additionally, safety data from the BZA monotherapy programme have been included. About 850 women have 
been exposed to the FDC of BZA/CE with 20 mg BZA for 2 years. Data for the FDC are sparse beyond 2 years of 
exposure; only for BZA monotherapy data are available for up to 7 years.

The analysis of the most common AEs occurring in more than 10% of patients did not reveal any unexpected 
findings. About 3 to 4% of women experienced treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) considered severe 
and  related  to  therapy  by  the  investigators;  there  were  no  clear  pattern  or  significant  differences  in  TEAE 
between groups. However, the validity of the relatedness of AEs to BZA/CE treatment is questioned due to the 
serious GCP inspection findings. The most common severe drug-related TEAE was headache in all groups. As 
expected when comparing placebo with HRT, hot flushes occurred more frequently in the placebo group. 
Because of the  known SERM and  CE class effects relevant AE have been specifically analysed; this included 
venous  thromboembolic  events  (VTE),  cardiovascular  (CHD)  events,  cerebrovascular  accidents  (CVAs),  and 
malignancies.  Post-hoc,  an  independent  adjudication  committee  was  initialised  to  review  the  AEs  of  special 
interest VTEs, CHD, and CVA. Considering the number of women exposed, the lack of data in elderly women, and 
the duration of treatment, the available safety data for BZA/CE do not allow to assess whether the incidence of 
these  rare  adverse  events  is  increased  in  women  treated  with  BZA  20 mg  /  CE  compared  to  placebo  or  to 
historical data for CE/MPA. 
As regards VTE there were only 3 events in the BZA/CE 20 mg / 0.45 mg and none in the 20 mg / 0.625 mg 
group. Resistance to activated protein C or resistance to other markers for venous thromboembolism have not 
been  measured  which  adds  to  the  uncertainty  of  the  knowledge  about  the  unfavourable  effects.  As  regards 
cardiac events a possible increase in the incidence of cardiac events for women treated with CE/MPA has been 
identified, while the data provided for the registration of bazedoxifene monotherapy did not demonstrate such 
an increased risk with either BZA 20 mg or 40 mg compared to placebo. The incidence of cerebrovascular events 
was not increased with BZA monotherapy (Studies 300 and 301) as compared to placebo and in the CE-alone 
substudy of the WHI study in women aged 50 to 59 years, there was no increased risk of ischemic stroke due to 
hormone therapy. Regarding breast cancer, there is an increase in risk associated with CE/MPA combination 
therapy and possibly also with CE monotherapy. Regarding ovarian carcinoma, there were 5 cases of ovarian 
carcinoma with BZA 20 mg monotherapy versus no cases in the placebo group in study 301. Ovarian cancer was 
reported in 2 out of 4868 patients in all BZA/CE groups. Long-term use of oestrogen-only HRT is associated with 
a slightly increased risk of ovarian cancer. With BZA monotherapy 5 cases of thyroid cancer occurred versus 1 
case in the placebo group over the 7 years study period in study 301. Based on the available data overall the 
Applicant proposes to predefine VTE and increased triglycerides as important identified risks and CVA, CHD, 
breast cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, lung cancer, thyroid cancer, and skin cancer 
as important potential risks in the RMP. This was endorsed by the PRAC and the CHMP.  
As regards endometrial safety from study 203 it can be concluded that a dose of 5 mg BZA is insufficient for 
endometrial protection with regard to both doses of CE; a dose of 5 mg BZA was not further studied in phase III 
studies. 
Regarding study 303 a GCP inspection was performed, with the result of GCP non-compliance. There were major 
and critical findings in particular regarding the handling and reporting of endometrial biopsies. Nevertheless, at 
month 24, 2 cases of endometrial hyperplasia / malignancy had been detected in the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg 
group as well as in the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg group. 
In study 3307 one case of endometrial hyperplasia was observed at month 12 each in the BZA 20 mg  / CE 
0.45 mg and the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg group. No endometrial carcinomas were observed in this study. The 
upper limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval of the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia was below 2% in 
each of the two groups. It was noted that only the diagnosis of the endometrial biopsy, not a more detailed 
description of the macroscopic and microscopic findings by the pathologists is available. Thus, more detailed 
information on cases diagnosed as “endometrium, other” could not be provided by the Applicant and no further 
assessment in this respect is possible. In addition, in study 3307 concerns remain with regard to 4 patients in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/383987/2014 
Page 124/153 
  
  
 
 
BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg in whom no biopsy was performed at month 12 and endometrial thickness was ≥4 mm. 
It is acknowledged that the Applicant reported that these 4 patients had refused a biopsy. In addition, in 8 
patients of the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg group neither a biopsy nor TVUS was performed. For 4 patients of these 
patients no reasons are given, while for the other 4 subjects biopsies and TVUS were refused or the patient had 
moved. Nevertheless the amount of missing data was considered not unusual for a study of this size. 
Regarding endometrial thickness measured by TVUS at month 12 statistical significant increases in endometrial 
thickness vs. baseline were reported in the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg group, the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg group, 
and the CE 0.45 mg / MPA 1.5 mg group in study 3307. All these increases were statistically significant higher 
compared to the change vs. baseline in the placebo group. Numerically the proportion of patients with TVUS 
findings of potential clinical importance regarding endometrial thickness results was higher in the BZA 20 mg / 
CE 0.625 mg group and the CE 0.45 mg /MPA 1.5 mg group compared to the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg and the 
placebo group. (For details regarding endometrial thickness see paragraph Gynaecological Safety below). 
In summary endometrial safety of BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg and BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 was considered to be 
sufficiently demonstrated. 
Ovarian volume or the incidence of ovarian cysts do not appear to be adversely affected by BZA/CE. 
With regard to the bleeding pattern, in the population included in study 3307, the bleeding pattern in the two 
BZA/CE groups was similar to placebo and more favourable compared to CE 0.45 mg / MPA 1.5 mg. However, 
it  is  noted  that  the  dose  of  1.5 mg  MPA  is  low  and  that  no  comparison  of  the  products  applied  for  vs.  CE 
0.625 mg / MPA 2.5 mg or CE 0.625 mg / MPA 5 mg was provided. In addition, the population of study 3307 was 
not  selected  based  on  a  minimum  frequency  /  severity  of  hot  flushes  and  is  therefore  not  identical  with  a 
population to be treated for VMS. 
Although differences are small adverse events of bone fracture occurred more often in patients treated with any 
combination of BZA and CE than with placebo. The Applicant provided additional analyses of the adverse events 
of  bone  fracture  by  summarising  all  potential  osteoporotic  fractures  occurring  ≥120  days  after  first  dose  of 
treatment  considering  the  bone  remodelling  cycle  of  approximately  120  days.  These  analyses  do  not  show 
clinically  relevant  differences  between  BZA  /  CE  groups  and  placebo.  When  further  subtracting  potentially 
traumatic fractures confirmed by review of patient narratives for each fracture potentially osteoporotic fractures 
were equally distributed across treatment groups.  
The analysis of deaths did not reveal an imbalance between groups.  
A consolidated presentation and discussion of SAEs other than death occurring in the BZA/CE 20 mg / 0.45 mg 
and 20 mg / 0.625 mg versus both BZA 20 mg and CE/MPA was missing in the Summary of Clinical Safety but 
contained in supportive tables in the annex. This analysis did not indicate relevant differences between active 
treatment  groups  as  regards  SAEs.  Overall,  there  were  no  significant  differences  in  the  incidence  of  SAEs 
between BZA 20 mg / CE and placebo, although small imbalances with low absolute numbers occurred. SAEs of 
CAD,  chest  pain,  cholecystitis,  cholelithiasis,  abnormal  endometrium  results,  cerebrovascular  accident, 
transient  ischaemic  attack,  and  deep  vein  thrombosis  occurred  more  often  with  active  treatment  than  with 
placebo. Treatment with a fixed combination of BZA and CE did not result in an increase in the incidence of ocular 
adverse events compared to placebo.  
As regards laboratory findings treatment with BZA 20 mg / CE had no clinically relevant influence on the lipid 
profile, C-reactive protein, plasma concentrations of homocysteine, mean fasting glucose levels, fasting insulin, 
parameters of liver or renal function, haemoglobin, haematocrit, or platelet counts, coagulation parameters, or 
thyroid stimulating hormone compared to placebo. Decreases from baseline in serum calcium, phosphorus, and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/383987/2014 
Page 125/153 
  
  
 
 
alkaline phosphatase values were observed in all groups including placebo at all scheduled time points, but there 
were few occurrences of potentially clinically important decreases in calcium or phosphorus. With respect to the 
coagulation system the Applicant has investigated several coagulation parameters to evaluate potential changes 
that might result in a higher risk for thromboembolic complications. Currently available data about patients with 
abnormal coagulation laboratory results during on- and post-therapy time periods do not show an association of 
the thromboembolic risk with the changes observed in the parameters of coagulation or fibrinolysis. Resistance 
to activated protein C or resistance to other markers for venous thromboembolism have not been measured 
which has to be reflected in the uncertainty of the knowledge about the unfavourable effects. The available data 
also do not indicate an influence of treatment with a fixed combination of BZA and CE compared to placebo on 
changes in vital signs or blood pressure. 
No clear pattern or clinical relevance of differences in adverse events in special populations between BZA 20 mg 
/ CE and placebo treated women has been seen in the data provided. However, the amount of data in the elderly 
as well as in women of other than white ethnicity is very limited and thus no definite conclusion as regards age 
and ethnicity can be drawn.  
No drug interaction studies were conducted with BZA/CE which is considered acceptable based on the known PK 
of the components of this FDC. 
A GCP inspection of trials 303 and 305 revealed critical findings as regards the safety assessment for BZA/CE. 
For details regarding the inspection findings please refer to the GCP section in the Introduction to the Clinical 
Aspects. The validity of the assessment of discontinuations due to AEs has been questioned for the investigated 
sites  of  study  303  in  the  GCP  inspection  report.  The  Applicant  has  therefore  provided  updated  analyses  of 
discontinuation due to AEs including analyses of relative frequencies calculated without data from investigator 
sites 447 and 450 of study 303. The provided analyses do not indicate significant differences in the rates of 
discontinuation due to AEs re-analyses and the original analyses. Adverse events of hot flush and osteoporosis 
leading to discontinuation occurred more often with placebo than with active treatment.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Although the Applicant has provided an extensive dataset comparing BZA/CE with placebo, these data do not 
allow for an assessment of rare adverse events known to be relevant for BZA or CE/MPA. Furthermore, relevant 
data for a direct comparison in the provided clinical trials to either BZA or CE as monotherapy is limited as well 
as  data  in  women  above  65  years  of  age  or  beyond  2  years  of  treatment.  Comparisons  to  HRT  and  BZA 
monotherapy are based on historical data and the BZA licensing dossier. 
The  known  SERM  and  CE  class  effects  include  venous  thromboembolic  events  (VTE),  cardiovascular  (CHD) 
events, cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), and malignancies. Considering the number of women exposed, the 
lack of data in elderly women, and the duration of treatment the available safety data for BZA/CE do not allow 
to assess whether the incidence of these rare adverse events is increased in women treated with BZA 20 mg / 
CE compared to placebo or to historical data for CE/MPA. It was agreed to address these issues in the RMP.  
As expected when comparing HRT with placebo, hot flushes occurred more frequently in the placebo group; 
adverse events “hot flush” and “osteoporosis leading to discontinuation” occurred more often with placebo than 
with active treatment. Although differences are small adverse events of bone fracture occurred more often in 
patients treated with any combination of BZA and CE than with placebo; additional analyses of these adverse 
events revealed that potentially osteoporotic fractures were equally distributed across treatment groups. As 
regards SAEs small imbalances with low absolute numbers occurred; serious adverse events of CAD, chest pain, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/383987/2014 
Page 126/153 
  
  
 
 
cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, abnormal endometrium results, CVA, TIA, and deep vein thrombosis occurred more 
often with active treatment than with placebo.  
Due to the late introduction of BZA into the market, post marketing exposure to BZA is low. 
For  the  assessment  of  endometrial  safety  data  from  two  studies  were  provided.  However,  study  303  is  not 
considered GCP-compliant, in particular regarding the investigation of endometrial safety. Nevertheless, in this 
study 1 case of endometrial hyperplasia was observed in year 1 in the two BZA/CE groups while 3 cases of 
endometrial hyperplasia / malignancy were detected during the second year of treatment in the two BZA/CE 
groups.  
In study 3307, the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval of the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia 
was below 2% in each of the two BZA/CE groups. In 12 of 445 and 11 of 474 patients in the BZA 20 mg / CE 
0.45 mg  and  the  BZA  20 mg  /  CE  0.625 mg  group,  respectively,  no  reassuring  outcome  with  regard  to 
endometrial safety is available. In 4 and 3 patients in the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg and the BZA 20 mg / CE 
0.625 mg group, respectively, no biopsy was performed at month 12 and endometrial thickness was ≥4 mm. 
Nevertheless, the amount of missing data was considered not unusual for a study of this size. With regard to 
endometrial thickness, study 3307 is considered most relevant as the treatment duration was 1 year. At month 
12, statistically significant increases from baseline were observed in the CE 0.45 mg / MPA 1.5 mg group (0.79 
mm). These increases were statistically significant higher than in the placebo group (0.08 mm). However, it can 
also be stated that the increase with BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg was numerically lower than with CE 0.45 mg / MPA 
1.5  mg.  In  summary,  the  endometrial  safety  of  BZA  20 mg  /  CE  0.45 mg  was  considered  as  sufficiently 
demonstrated by the CHMP.  
In conclusion, considering the number of women exposed, the lack of data in elderly women, and the duration 
of treatment the available safety data do not allow to assess whether there is an additive effect of the fixed 
combination of BZA and CEs on the incidence of adverse events known for either of these active substances. 
However, the CHMP agreed that despite the validity of the safety data was corrupted based on the serious GCP 
inspection findings the available data from study 3307 permitted to conclude that the endometrial safety of BZA 
20  mg  /  CE  0.45  mg  was  sufficiently  demonstrated.  The  important  possible  and  identified  risks  of  this 
combination will be further investigated and missing information collected as per agreed RMP for this product 
and also within the requested DUS and PASS studies.  
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The Applicant has provided documents that set out a detailed description of the system of pharmacovigilance 
(Version  3.1  dated  26  April  2012).  A  statement  signed  by  the  Applicant  and  the  qualified  person  for 
pharmacovigilance,  indicating  that  the  Applicant  has  the  services  of  a  qualified  person  responsible  for 
pharmacovigilance and the necessary means for the notification of any adverse reaction occurring either in the 
Community or in a third country has been provided.  
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the Applicant fulfils the requirements 
as described in Volume 9A of the Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the EU and provides adequate evidence 
that  the  Applicant  has  the  services  of  a  qualified  person  responsible  for  pharmacovigilance  and  has  the 
necessary means for the notification of any adverse reaction suspected of occurring either in the Community or 
in a third country.

Beneficial effects 
Effect on oestrogen deficiency symptoms 
In the phase 3 study pivotal for the treatment of VMS (study 305), BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg as well as BZA 
20 mg / CE 0.625 mg were statistically significant more effective than placebo with respect to reduction of the 
number and severity of hot flushes.  
In this study, statistically significant superiority of BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg and of BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg vs. 
placebo was shown with respect to the co-primary endpoints change from baseline in the average daily number 
of  moderate  and  severe  hot  flushes  at  week  4  and week  12  and  change  from  baseline in  the  average  daily 
severity score of hot flushes at week 4 and 12. At week 12 the mean change from baseline in the average daily 
number of moderate and severe hot flushes was -7.63, -8.05, and -4.92 in the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg, the BZA

20 mg / CE 0.625 mg, and the placebo group, respectively. At week 12 the mean change from baseline in the 
average daily severity score of hot flushes was -0.87, -01.21, and -0.26 in the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg, the BZA 
20 mg / CE 0.625 mg, and the placebo group, respectively. Results regarding secondary endpoints related to 
VMS in this pivotal study support this conclusion. 
Available  data  suggest  that  the  efficacy  of  conjugated  oestrogens  (CE)  for  the  treatment  of  hot  flushes  is 
decreased in the fixed dose combination of BZA/CE, compared to the combination CE/MPA. Unfortunately, this 
question was not studied due to lack of an active CE/MPA control group in study 305.  
The  investigation  of  VVA  is  acknowledged  as  additional  evidence  in  the  oestrogen  deficiency  symptoms 
indication, although not mandatory according to European guidance. 
A superior efficacy of the higher dose strengths BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg compared to the lower dose strength 
BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg was not convincingly shown. Following concerns expressed by the CHMP, the Applicant 
has withdrawn the higher dose strength BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg during this application. 
Osteoporosis 
In both trials with osteoporosis substudies (studies 303 and 3307), the fixed dose combinations of BZA 20 mg 
/ CE 0.45 mg and BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg led to significant increases in BMD of the lumbar spine and total hip 
after  1  or  2  years  of  therapy  compared  to  a  decrease  in  BMD  with  placebo  in  women  >5  and  ≤5  years 
postmenopausal.  The  mean  percent  changes  in  lumbar  spine  BMD  from  baseline  to  Month  12  or  24  were 
statistically significant different from placebo. However, study 303 was classified as GCP  non-compliant and 
could not be taken into account for the assessment of efficacy of BZA/CE.  
In study 303 investigating different doses of BZA (10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg) in combination with CE, independent 
of  the  dose  of  CE  the  effect  was  most  pronounced  with  the  lowest  dose  of  10 mg  BZA,  attenuating  with 
increasing doses of BZA. This trend was also seen in BMD of total hip and the other hip areas. The responder 
analysis was in line with these findings. For BZA/CE combinations containing 20 mg of BZA, effects on BMD at 
lumbar spine were more pronounced than with raloxifene 60 mg. 
Serum markers of bone metabolism were determined in a subset of women participating in these trials. At all 
time-points and for all BZA/CE doses the median percent changes from baseline in serum concentrations of bone 
turnover markers (BTMs) were significantly greater than for placebo, indicating a decrease in bone turnover. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
General 
In the pivotal studies, formulations other than the to be marketed (TBM) formulation were used. Thus, proof of 
bioequivalence  between  study  formulations  and  the  TBM  formulation  was  required.  With  regard  to  BZA, 
bioequivalence was adequately demonstrated. 
CE  is  an  extract  from  pregnant  mare´s  urine  and  thus  a  naturally  occurring  product  containing  a  not  fully 
characterised mixture of at least 160 components. Of these, 10 substances are listed in Ph. Eur. For proof of 
bioequivalence, the 2 most abundant oestrogens in CE, estrone and equilin, were selected. In addition, some 
further  oestrogens  were  measured  in  the  4  most  relevant  bioequivalence  studies.  Thus,  components  for 
demonstration  of  BE  were  obviously  selected  based  on  a  pragmatic  approach,  selecting  components  which 
comprise  the  largest  part  of  the  mixture  and  which  can  be  quantified  by  currently  available  bioanalytical 
methods. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/383987/2014 
Page 141/153 
  
  
 
 
With  regard  to  the  total  (conjugated  and  unconjugated)  oestrogens  prespecified  for  the  analysis  of 
bioequivalence,  the  80%-125%  acceptance  range  was  met.  It  is  noted  that  with  regard  to  unconjugated 
oestrogens, the bioanalytical methods were of insufficient sensitivity. Therefore, only results regarding total 
oestrogens can be taken into account for bioequivalence.  
The  Pharmacokinetics  Working  Party  (PKWP)  of  the  CHMP  was  involved  regarding  the  concept  and 
methodological issues regarding proof of bioequivalence of CE as there was no previous regulatory experience 
within the EU in this regard. The PKWP agreed that the concept to demonstrate bioequivalence with respect to 
the  active  substance  “conjugated  oestrogens”  based  on  2  lead  substances,  i.e.  estrone  and  equilin,  is 
acceptable. It was also agreed that bioequivalence should be demonstrated with respect to total (conjugated 
and unconjugated) oestrogens and that demonstration of BE with respect to free (unconjugated) oestrogens is 
not required. 
Consequently, bioequivalence between the formulations used in the clinical studies and the TBM formulations 
was considered adequately demonstrated. 
Oestrogen deficiency symptoms 
With regard to hot flushes and VVA, superiority vs. placebo was shown for BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg and BZA 
20 mg / CE 0.45 mg although regarding the lower dose strengths statistically significant superiority vs. placebo 
was not demonstrated for all primary endpoints of the phase 3 study regarding VVA (study 306). In addition, the 
pivotal study regarding treatment of VMS (study 305) was classified as GCP non-compliant. Nevertheless, the 
results regarding hot flushes can be taken into account for the assessment of efficacy. 
Comparisons between the 2 dose strengths applied for with respect to efficacy in the treatment of oestrogen 
deficiency symptoms had not been prespecified in the pivotal studies and thus, no confirmatory analyses are 
available in this respect. 
There is a concern that the efficacy of CE in the combination BZA/CE is decreased compared to the combination 
CE/MPA. Unfortunately, in phase 3 studies investigating the efficacy of BZA/CE in the treatment of oestrogen 
deficiency symptoms no CE/MPA control group was included. Thus, for the comparison of efficacy of BZA/CE vs. 
CE/MPA, data from a phase 2 study (203), from a phase 3 osteoporosis study (3307), and published data on 
CE/MPA had to be taken into account.  
With respect to treatment of VVA, it is noted that in the pivotal study a control group treated with a topical 
oestrogen preparation is also missing. 
In addition, few patients >65 years of age were included in the clinical trials. Thus, experience in this age group 
is  limited.  BZA/CE  was  also  not  studied  in  patients  with  oestrogen  deficiency  symptoms  due  to  premature 
menopause. 
With regard to the efficacy of BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg in patients for whom treatment with progestin-containing 
therapy is not appropriate, a post-hoc subgroup analysis including patients with a medical history of diabetes or 
depression was provided. 
Osteoporosis 
In contrast to BZA monotherapy (see published EPAR for Conbriza) where changes in BMD from baseline are 
more  pronounced  with  increasing  doses  of  BZA,  in  the  available  data  with  BZA/CE  this  relation  is  opposite. 
Furthermore, in study 3307 for both doses of BZA/CE changes in BMD were not statistically significant between 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/383987/2014 
Page 142/153 
  
  
 
 
BZA  monotherapy,  BZA/CE,  and  CE/MPA  groups,  but  effects  were  most  pronounced  with  CE/MPA.  The 
non-inferiority  analysis  for  BMD  showed  non-inferiority  of  BZA/CE  20 mg  /  0.625 mg  to  BZA  20 mg  but  no 
superiority, whilst BZA/CE 20 mg / 0.45 mg even failed the pre-specified non-inferiority criterion.  
As regards the active comparator CE/MPA only the lower dose strength containing 0.45 mg CE has been included 
in the pivotal trials, while data on a comparison of changes in BMD from baseline with 0.625 mg CE containing 
products  are  missing.  From  the  available  data,  it  has  to  be  expected  that  differences  between  the  CE/MPA 
containing 0.625 mg of CE compared to the applied dose strengths of BZA/CE would be even more pronounced. 
The  data  supporting  the  osteoporosis  indication  are  solely  based  on  surrogate  parameters  referencing  to 
established anti-fracture efficacy of both components. In general, this approach is endorsed. However, data are 
only derived from substudies within the pivotal trials; the pivotal trials 303 and 3307 have not been designed as 
osteoporotic trials and the populations in the substudies have not been selected on the basis of risk factors for 
osteoporosis. Furthermore, study 303 was classified as GCP non-compliant and should not be taken into account 
for the assessment of efficacy of BZA/CE leaving only data from 1 trial for the assessment of the efficacy of 
BZA/CE as regards treatment of osteoporosis. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
BZA/CE 
About  3  to  4%  of  women  experienced  treatment  emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs)  considered  severe  and 
related to therapy by the investigators. There was no clear pattern or significant differences in TEAEs between 
groups. The most common severe drug-related TEAE was headache in all groups.  
Endometrial safety was investigated in study 303 and 3307. Study 303 was classified as GCP non-compliant, 
which was agreed by the CHMP. Nevertheless, the cases of endometrial hyperplasia / malignancy detected after 
treatment duration of 24 months raise concerns regarding endometrial safety during long-term treatment and 
this  is  included  as  important  potential  risk  in  the  RMP.  There  were  statistically  significant  increases  in 
endometrial thickness compared to placebo at Month 12 vs. baseline in the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg group, the 
BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg group and the CE 0.45 mg / MPA 1.5 mg group in study 3307. As regards increases 
in endometrial thickness in terms of an increase from baseline >3 mm or >5 mm as well as an endometrial 
thickness >4 mm or >8 mm, numerically, the proportion of patients was higher in the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg 
group and the CE 0.45 mg / MPA 1.5 mg group compared to the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg and the placebo 
group. 
Regarding breast cancer, there is an increase in risk associated with CE/MPA combination therapy and possibly 
also with CE monotherapy. Regarding ovarian carcinoma, there were 5 cases of ovarian carcinoma with BZA 
20 mg monotherapy versus no cases in the placebo group in study 301. Ovarian cancer was reported in 2 out of 
4868 patients in all BZA/CE groups. Long-term use of oestrogen-only HRT is associated with a slightly increased 
risk of ovarian cancer. With BZA alone, 5 cases of thyroid cancer occurred versus 1 case in the placebo group 
over the 7 years study period in study 301. Ovarian volume or the incidence of ovarian cysts does not appear to 
be adversely affected by BZA/CE. 
With regard to breast density, the claim of the Applicant that BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg and BZA 20 mg / CE 
0.625 mg demonstrated similar changes in mammographic breast density compared to placebo is not agreed 
due to the fact that the non-inferiority limit vs. placebo was not sufficiently justified and that in study 4000 a 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/383987/2014 
Page 143/153 
  
  
 
 
decrease in mammographic breast density was observed in the placebo group after 2 years, but not in the BZA 
20 mg / CE 0.625 mg group. However, it is acknowledged that no increase from baseline in mammographic 
breast density was observed with BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg and BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg. Therefore, a warning 
in  this  respect,  as  included  in  the  SmPC  of  other  HT  products,  especially  of  oestrogen  /  progestogen  fixed 
combinations, is not required. Breast pain / tenderness was less frequent in patients treated with BZA 20 mg / 
CE 0.45 mg and BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg, compared to CE 0.45 mg / MPA 1.5 mg. 
The  assessment  of  vaginal  bleeding  and  spotting  based  on  subject’s  diaries  did  not  reveal  a  safety  signal. 
Spotting was less frequent and the rate of amenorrhea was higher in patients treated with BZA 20 mg / CE 
0.45 mg and BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg, compared to CE 0.45 mg / MPA 1.5 mg. 
The  analysis  of  deaths  and  serious  adverse  events  other  than  death  did  not  indicate  relevant  differences 
between active treatment groups. While there were no significant differences in the incidence of serious adverse 
events between BZA 20 mg / CE and placebo, small imbalances with low absolute numbers occurred. Serious 
adverse  events  of  coronary  artery  disease,  chest  pain,  cholecystitis,  cholelithiasis,  abnormal  endometrium 
results, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischaemic attack, and deep vein thrombosis occurred more often 
with active treatment than with placebo.  
BZA 20 mg / CE had no clinically relevant influence on the lipid profile, C-reactive protein, plasma concentrations 
of  homocysteine,  mean  fasting  glucose  levels,  fasting  insulin,  parameters  of  liver  or  renal  function, 
haemoglobin,  haematocrit,  or  platelet  counts,  coagulation  parameters  or  thyroid  stimulating  hormone 
compared to placebo. Decreases from baseline in serum calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase values 
were observed in all groups including placebo at all scheduled time points, but there were few occurrences of 
potentially clinically important decreases in calcium or phosphorus. The available data also do not indicate an 
influence of treatment with a fixed combination of BZA and CEs compared to placebo on changes in vital signs 
or blood pressure.  
No clear pattern or clinical relevance of differences in adverse events in special populations between BZA 20 mg 
/ CE and placebo treated women has been seen in the data provided. Overall, discontinuations due to adverse 
events  were  equally  distributed  across  groups.  Adverse  events  of  hot  flush  and  osteoporosis  leading  to 
discontinuation occurred more often with placebo than with active treatment. 
CE 
The increased risks of VTE, stroke, myocardial infarction, ovarian cancer, and possibly also dementia associated 
with oestrogen-only HRT are well-known. 
BZA 
The safety profile of BZA is mainly in line with the known safety profile of drugs in the SERM class. AE of special 
interest are venous thromboembolic events (VTE), cardiovascular events, cerebrovascular AE, vasodilatation, 
reproductive  disorders  including  breast  disorders,  and  leg  cramps.  BZA  monotherapy  over  7  years  was 
associated with a numerical increase in ovarian and thyroid cancer versus placebo.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Endometrial safety in terms of incidence of endometrial hyperplasia / malignancy was studied in studies 303 and 
3307.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/383987/2014 
Page 144/153 
  
  
 
 
A GCP inspection of 2 investigator sites (447 and 450) of trial 303 contributing about 35% of the total trial 
population revealed critical findings as regards the safety assessment for BZA/CE. The critical findings relate to 
missing source data for 197 subjects from these sites together with evidence of missing source data from other 
sites,  no  adequate  overview  of  the  trial  conduct  at  the  two  sites  i.e.  about  serious  non-compliances  by  the 
Sponsor, incorrectly assessed relatedness of adverse events to study medication by investigators (with a clear 
shift  to  ‘not  related’)  also  seen  in  the  GCP  inspection  of  trial  305  and  thus  appearing  to  be  a  systematic 
deficiency, concerns regarding the quality of safety data on the adverse event ‘hypertension’, and adverse event 
related subjects’ withdrawal / discontinuation. The Sponsor’s re-monitoring at sites 447 and 450 did not remedy 
the  systematic  failures  in  relation  to  adverse  event  reporting  and  at  this  stage  it  does  not  appear  to  be 
realistically possible to remedy this finding. Study 303 was classified as GCP non-compliant in a GCP inspection 
and therefore cannot be used to justify the endometrial safety of BZA/CE. Nevertheless, 3 cases of endometrial 
hyperplasia / malignancy were observed during year 2 in the two BZA/CE groups of this study. 
In study 3307, only the diagnosis of the endometrial biopsy, not a more detailed description of the macroscopic 
and microscopic findings by the pathologists is available. Thus, more detailed information on cases diagnosed as 
“endometrium, other” could not be provided and no further assessment in this respect is possible. In addition, 
in study 3307 in 4 patients in the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg group no biopsy was performed at Month 12 and 
endometrial thickness was ≥4 mm. In addition, in 8 patients of the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg group neither a 
biopsy nor TVUS was performed.  
Although about 1580 women have been exposed to either dose of BZA/CE numbers in the active control groups 
are only 340 for BZA 20 mg, 423 for raloxifene 60 mg, and 399 CE/MPA 0.45 mg / 1.5 mg. Due to this limitation 
in the number of women treated together with the limited treatment duration and missing data in elderly women 
the data set does not allow the safety assessment of rare AEs known to be relevant class effects for CE or BZA 
(e.g. VTE or cancer). Thus, it cannot be concluded whether the FDC of BZA/CE has additive effects on the risk 
profiles known for both single components; no definite conclusions on VTE, cardiac, or cerebrovascular AEs as 
well  as  on  the  risk  of  cancer  can  be  drawn.  Therefore  these  risks  were  included  as  important  identified  or 
potential risks in the agreed version of the RMP. Furthermore, as regards VTEs resistance to activated protein C 
or resistance to other markers for venous thromboembolism have not been measured. The CHMP agreed that it 
is likely that at least most risks known for the individual components apply to this FDC.  
In  addition,  there  is  an  increase  in  risk  for  breast  cancer  associated  with  CE/MPA  combination  therapy  and 
possibly also with CE monotherapy. A study in monkeys revealed that CE may increase the proliferation rate of 
mammary gland cells when added to BZA in doses corresponding to the intended human therapeutic dose. Thus, 
the possibility that the BZA/CE combination leads to an increased breast cancer risk as compared to BZA alone 
cannot be excluded and breast cancer was included in the RMP as important potential risk.  
The interpretation of unfavourable effects in elderly women as well as in women of other than white ethnicity is 
limited by the low number of women in these groups. Due to the late introduction of BZA into the market, post 
marketing exposure to BZA is low and the limited data currently do not add to the interpretation of risks involved 
with BZA treatment. In addition, the PASS requested at the time of marketing authorisation of BZA so far did not 
deliver  relevant  data  due  to  considerable  limitations  of  the  chosen  databases  and  the  late  introduction  into 
market.  
The increased risks in particular of long-term administration of CE alone or CE combined with a progestin are 
well-known. How these risks are modified when CE is combined with BZA is currently unknown and this was 
included as missing information into the RMP.

Although  the  bleeding  pattern  in  the  two  BZA/CE  groups  investigated  was  similar  to  placebo  and  more 
favourable  compared  to  CE  0.45 mg  /  MPA  1.5 mg  the  dose  of  1.5 mg  MPA  used  in  this  trial  is  low  and  no 
comparison of the products applied for vs. CE 0.625 mg / MPA 2.5 mg or CE 0.625 mg / MPA 5 mg was provided.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Oestrogen deficiency symptoms 
Generally,  oestrogen  deficiency  symptoms  may  adversely  affect  quality  of  life  but  are  not  associated  with 
serious  long-term  sequelae.  Nevertheless,  there  is  a  population  of  postmenopausal  women  who  experience 
severe and frequent VMS, often also negatively affecting sleep, and for whom effective treatment is required. 
Thus, hot flushes are considered as the most important endpoint regarding efficacy with regards to oestrogen 
deficiency symptoms. This is in accordance with the EMA Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products 
for  hormone  replacement  therapy  of  oestrogen  deficiency  symptoms 
in  postmenopausal  women 
(EMEA/CHMP/021/97 rev. 1), Oct 2005, which recommends the number of moderate and severe or hot flushes 
as the primary endpoint. 
With regard to safety, endometrial safety is considered as a very important issue.  
In the treatment of oestrogen deficiency symptoms, BZA/CE is expected to be used for long-term therapy of 
several years in many patients. Therefore, potential serious risks associated with long-term use such as VTE or 
stroke are considered as very important. 
Efficacy regarding VVA is considered as less important as there is a consensus that local vulvovaginal symptoms 
should preferably be treated with topical oestrogens. Thus, BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg as well as BZA 20 mg / CE 
0.625 mg would not be considered as suitable treatment options in patients with VVA only. 
The bleeding pattern, breast pain, and mammographic breast density are taken into account by the Applicant for 
the benefit risk evaluation. Irregular bleeding and breast pain are not in itself serious events associated with 
adverse long-term sequelae but may be of importance for individual patients. These adverse effects should be 
taken  into  account  for  the  benefit-risk  evaluation,  but  are  not  considered  as  more  important  than  other 
non-serious adverse effects. 
Mammographic breast density is also an effect to be considered as with oestrogen / progestogen combinations 
an increase in breast density is observed. An increase in mammographic breast density is expected to adversely 
affect the detection of breast cancer in mammograms. However, no conclusions regarding the risk of breast 
cancer can be drawn, based on a lack of increase in mammographic breast density. 
Osteoporosis 
As regards unfavourable effects, the use of HRT or SERMs including BZA is amongst others associated with the 
occurrence of AEs of VTE, coronary heart disease (CHD), cancer, and hot flushes. Especially cardiovascular as 
well  as  cancer  related  events  carry  a  significant  burden  for  both  the  individual  patient  and  the  society. The 
relevant AEs are both potential life threatening and disabling and are therefore considered as important. 
The effect on osteoporosis could be important as postmenopausal osteoporosis is a common, systemic skeletal 
disorder. In general for medicinal products with known anti-fracture activity it can be assumed that increases in 
BMD  will  reduce  the  risk  of  osteoporotic  fracture.  However,  changes  in  BMD  have  only  unequivocally  been 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/383987/2014 
Page 146/153 
  
  
 
 
demonstrated in comparison to placebo, while in comparison to the active comparators BZA 20 mg alone or 
CE/MPA they were not convincing. In particular, as no contribution of CE to the effects of BZA/CE on BMD was 
demonstrated,  the  efficacy  in  the  treatment  of  osteoporosis  is  considered  as  unimportant.  No  additive  or 
synergistic  effects  of  the  FDC  compared  to  BZA  monotherapy  or  CE/MPA  therapy  has  been  demonstrated. 
Furthermore, while the HRT Core EU SmPC limits the use of these medicinal products to the shortest duration 
possible,  use  of  BZA  for  the  treatment  of  postmenopausal  osteoporosis  would  be  required  over  long 
time-periods. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Oestrogen deficiency symptoms 
The efficacy of both dose strengths of BZA/CE vs. placebo in the treatment of oestrogen deficiency symptoms 
has been demonstrated in pivotal study 305. In this study, statistically significant superiority of BZA 20 mg / CE 
0.45 mg and of BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg vs. placebo was shown with respect to the co-primary endpoints 
change from baseline in the average daily number of moderate and severe hot flushes at Week 4 and Week 12 
and change from baseline in the average daily severity score of hot flushes at Week 4 and 12. 
However,  taking  all  data  into  account,  superior  efficacy  of  BZA  20 mg  /  CE  0.625 mg  vs.  BZA  20 mg  /  CE 
0.45 mg  was  not  sufficiently  demonstrated.  According  to  the  literature,  a  dose  dependent  increase  in  the 
efficacy of hormone therapy in the treatment of hot flushes is established. As the risks associated with CE are 
considered as dose-dependent, the higher dose strength BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg was insufficiently justified. 
Therefore, the Applicant has withdrawn the higher dose strength BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg from the application 
during the procedure. 
The available data also indicate that the efficacy of CE in the treatment of VMS is decreased in the combination 
BZA/CE,  compared  to  the  combination  of  CE/MPA.  Unfortunately,  a  CE/MPA  active  control  group  was  not 
included  in  the  studies  pivotal  for  the  treatment  of  oestrogen  deficiency  symptoms  so  that  the  decrease  in 
efficacy cannot be quantified. In addition, the lack of data regarding possible risks in particular during long-term 
administration of several years, which is expected in the treatment of oestrogen deficiency symptoms, also has 
to be taken into consideration. No conclusions can be drawn from the clinical trials in this respect, as the sample 
size and the treatment duration were not adequate to investigate these risks. In particular, the CHMP did not feel 
reassured with regards to the number of adverse events classified as low/similar to placebo in clinical studies. In 
particular, it was noted that BZA alone as well as CE alone are associated with an increased risk of VTE. In 
addition, stroke is a known risk of CE and a potential risk of BZA. Thus, there is a concern that the incidence of 
VTE and possibly also stroke will be increased with the combination of BZA/CE. That is why these risks were 
included as identified or potential risks in the agreed version of the RMP. Furthermore the results of the PASS 
and the DUS studies should provide further information regarding safety of this product. 
In  addition,  the  risk  of  breast  cancer  associated  with  BZA/CE  is  currently  unknown.  With  regard  to 
mammographic  breast  density,  it  is  acknowledged  that  no  increase  from  baseline  in  mammographic  breast 
density was observed with BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg and BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg. Therefore, a warning in this 
respect as included in the SmPC of other HT products, especially of oestrogen / progestogen fixed combinations, 
is not required. However, no conclusions such as no increase in the risk of breast cancer can be drawn, based on 
a lack of increase in mammographic breast density as mammographic breast density is no established surrogate 
endpoint in this respect. Data from monkeys are not fully reassuring in regard to mammary gland proliferation.

CE was able to increase proliferation markers even in the presence of BZA. Thus, the breast safety of BZA/CE 
remains uncertain and is addressed in the agreed version of the RMP. 
In study 3307 investigating primarily the efficacy of BZA/CE for osteoporosis, the rates of amenorrhea were 
higher in the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg group and the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg group, compared to CE 0.45 mg 
/ MPA 1.5 mg.  In addition, breast pain was less frequent in patients treated with both dose strengths of BZA/CE, 
compared to CE/MPA.  
Endometrial  safety  was  considered  by  the  CHMP  of  particular  importance.  Study  303  is  not  considered 
GCP-compliant, in particular regarding the investigation of endometrial safety. Nevertheless, in this study no 
cases of endometrial hyperplasia was observed in year 1 in the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg group while 2 cases of 
endometrial hyperplasia / malignancy were detected during the second year of treatment in the BZA 20 mg / CE 
0.45  mg  group.  In  study  3307,  the  upper  limit  of  the  2-sided  95%  confidence  interval  of  the  incidence  of 
endometrial hyperplasia was below the reference limit of the EMA Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal 
products  for  hormone  replacement  therapy  of  oestrogen  deficiency  symptoms  in  postmenopausal  women 
(EMEA/CHMP/021/97 rev. 1), Oct 2005 of 2% in each of the two BZA/CE groups. In 12 of 445 patients in the BZA 
20 mg / CE 0.45 mg no reassuring outcome with regard to endometrial safety is available. In 4 patients in the 
BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg no biopsy was performed at month 12 and endometrial thickness was ≥4 mm. As 
already stated above, this amount of missing data was considered not unusual for a study of this size. Regarding 
endometrial thickness measured by TVUS statistically significant increases vs. placebo were observed in the BZA 
20 mg / CE 0.45 mg group and the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.625 mg group at month 12 in study 3307. 
Taking into account that: 
-  the efficacy of BZA/CE combination vs. placebo in the treatment of oestrogen deficiency symptoms has been 
demonstrated in the pivotal for VMS treatment trial, 
-  the efficacy of CE in the treatment of VMS is decreased in the combination with BZA, 
-  the  available  data indicate  that  efficacy  of  the  BZA/CE  combination  is  lower  as  compared to the  CE/MPA 
combination (no CE/MPA arm in the pivotal 305 study)  
and also considering identified risks such as VTE and potential risks such as stroke, endometrial hyperplasia and 
others, the Applicant proposed for BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg a more narrow therapeutic indication: 
Treatment of oestrogen deficiency symptoms in postmenopausal women with a uterus (with at least 12 months 
since the last menses) for whom treatment with progestin-containing therapy is not appropriate. The experience 
treating women older than 65 years is limited. 
Taking into account that endometrial safety as well as other safety issues will be further addressed in RMP as 
well  as  in  DUS  and  PASS  studies,  the  benefit-risk  balance  of  this  more  narrow  therapeutic  indication  was 
considered as positive. 
Osteoporosis 
It  is  acknowledged  that  BZA/CE  demonstrated  relevant  increases  in  BMD  from  baseline  and  that  for  both 
components anti-fracture efficacy has been established. However, while the Applicant has provided data on an 
adequate effect of both doses of BZA/CE on changes in BMD from baseline compared to placebo, these effects 
appear to be less than those seen with the active control of CE 0.45 mg / MPA 1.5 mg, although this is probably 
not even the most efficacious dose of CE/MPA. In addition, BZA/CE did not show superiority to BZA 20 mg in 
changes  of  BMD  from  baseline  and  for  the  BZA  20 mg  /  CE  0.45 mg  dose  even  failed  the  pre-specified 
non-inferiority criterion. Furthermore, while with BZA effects on BMD increase with increasing dose, the opposite 
Assessment report

effect  has  been  seen  with  BZA/CE  were  the  lowest  doses  of  BZA  10 mg  /  CE  showed  the  most  pronounced 
increases  with  attenuating  effects  with  increasing  the  dose  of  BZA  indicating  relevant  pharmacodynamic 
interactions between both components. 
The fixed combination of BZA/CE has no superior efficacy on BMD compared to BZA monotherapy and appears 
to have inferior efficacy to CE/MPA.  
Furthermore, the duration of use for HRT has been limited to the shortest duration possible due to the adverse 
effects seen with this therapy. The data provided by the Applicant do not justify considering the risk profile of the 
new proposed combination of BZA/CE to be different from that seen with CE/MPA treatment as regards relevant 
AEs limiting the duration of use. 
While there was no added value shown for the fixed-dose combination of BZA/CE over the mono-components in 
the  treatment  of  postmenopausal  osteoporosis,  there  are  important  potential  life  threatening  and  disabling 
unfavourable  effects  associated  with  its  use.  It  is  not  possible  to  determine  how  the  incidence  of  these 
unfavourable effects with BZA/CE compares to the rates observed with other forms of the hormone replacement 
therapy or with SERMs.  
In consequence, the Applicant has withdrawn an osteoporosis related indication.

Divergent Position 
The undersigned members of CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s opinion recommending the granting of a 
Marketing Authorisation for Duavive. The reasons for divergent opinion were as follows: 
Some CHMP members considered that the benefit risk balance of Duavive is negative for the following reasons: 
The available data indicate that the efficacy of conjugated oestrogens (CE) in the treatment of VMS is decreased 
in  the  combination  with  bazedoxifene  (BZA),  compared  to  the  combination  CE/medroxprogesterone  acetate 
(MPA). Unfortunately, a CE/MPA active control group was not included in the studies pivotal for the treatment of 
oestrogen deficiency symptoms so that the decrease in efficacy could not be quantified. However, it is concluded 
that a higher dose of CE will be required for the treatment of oestrogen deficiency symptoms in the combination 
BZA/CE compared to the combination CE/MPA. 
Taking into account the well-known risks of CE/MPA or more generally of oestrogen / progestogen HRT and the 
current consensus that oestrogens for the treatment of oestrogen deficiency symptoms should be administered 
at the lowest possible dose an increase in the dose of CE seems hardly acceptable and is considered as a safety 
concern. 
Endometrial  safety  is  of  particular  importance.  Study  303  is  not  considered  GCP-compliant,  in  particular 
regarding  the  investigation  of  endometrial  safety.  Nevertheless,  in  this  study  no  cases  of  endometrial 
hyperplasia  was  observed  in  year  1  in  the  BZA  20  mg/CE  0.45  mg  group  while  2  cases  of  endometrial 
hyperplasia / malignancy were detected during the second year of treatment in the BZA 20 mg/CE 0.45 mg 
group. This finding is considered as a risk signal, raising concerns regarding safety during long-term treatment. 
In study 3307, the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval of the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia 
was below the reference limit of the CHMP HRT Guideline of 2% in each of the two BZA/CE groups. Nevertheless, 
there are concerns with respect to the analysis of endometrial safety, based on this study. In 12 of 445 patients 
in the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg no reassuring outcome with regard to endometrial safety is available. In 4 
patients in the BZA 20 mg / CE 0.45 mg no biopsy was performed at month 12 and endometrial thickness was 
≥4  mm.  As  already  stated  above,  a  very  low  number  of  additional  cases  of  hyperplasia  would  change  the 
outcome of the study from success to failure. 
The applicant proposes to conduct a PASS in the US, in particular to address concerns around endometrial safety 
in a post-marketing setting. A PASS to be conducted in the EU is not considered to be able to provide additional 
information regarding the safety issues of interest within a reasonable timeframe. 
In addition, the lack of data regarding possible risks in particular during long-term administration of several 
years  which  is  expected  in  the  treatment  of  oestrogen  deficiency  symptoms  has  also  to  be  taken  into 
consideration. No conclusions can be drawn from the clinical trials in this respect as the sample size and the 
treatment duration were not adequate to investigate these risks. In particular, it is noted that BZA alone as well 
as CE alone are associated with an increased risk of VTE. In addition, stroke is a known risk of CE and a potential 
risk of BZA. The risk of breast cancer associated with BZA/CE is currently unknown. 
Taking also into account: 
- that different progestogens have different activities and therefore, intolerance to a specific progestin cannot be 
extrapolated to progestins in general, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/383987/2014 
Page 152/153 
  
  
 
 
- that other treatment options exist for postmenopausal women with VMS who experienced adverse effects 
during treatment with a specific combined oestrogen progestin regimen, 
- that no data are available with respect to the benefits and risks of BZA 20 mg/CE 0.45 mg in the subgroup of 
postmenopausal patients intolerant of progestins, 
- that in particular, it is unknown whether patients discontinuing combined oestrogen progestin hormone 
therapy due to adverse effects will tolerate BZA 20 mg/CE 0.45 mg better, 
- that adverse effects such as flatulence, depression, mood swings, peripheral oedema, acne, hirsutism and 
increased weight, considered by the applicant as specific adverse effects of progestins, were observed in study 
3307 in the BZA 20 mg/CE 0.45 mg group and the CE 0.45 mg/MPA 1.5 mg group with comparable frequency, 
and 
- that it remains unknown which co-morbid conditions will be exacerbated by progestins, but not by BZA/CE, 
- that depression should not be considered as such a co-morbid condition because the depression score was 
similar with CE/MPA and placebo in the WHI study (Hays et al. 2003) and depression occurred with similar 
frequency in patients treated with CE/MPA or BZA/CE in study 3307, 
- that diabetes should not be considered as such a co-morbid condition as the risk of diabetes was decreased in 
patients treated with CE/MPA compared to placebo in the WHI study (Margolis et al. 2004) and fasting glucose 
was similar with CE/BZA, CE/MPA and placebo in study 3307, 
- that BZA/CE was not investigated in a population of postmenopausal women with diabetes or depression, 
the benefit risk balance of BZA 20 mg/CE 0.45 mg in the therapeutic indication applied for is considered 
negative.

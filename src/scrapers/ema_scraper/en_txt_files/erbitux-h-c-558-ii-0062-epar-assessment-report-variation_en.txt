2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Cetuximab is a chimeric monoclonal Immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody directed against the 
Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). EGFR signalling pathways are involved in the control of cell 
survival, cell cycle progression, angiogenesis, cell migration and cellular invasion/metastasis. 
Cetuximab binds to the EGFR with an affinity higher than that of endogenous ligands. Cetuximab 
blocks binding of endogenous EGFR ligands resulting in inhibition of the function of the receptor and 
induces the internalisation of EGFR, which can lead to down-regulation of the receptor. Cetuximab also 
targets cytotoxic immune effector cells towards EGFR-expressing tumour cells (antibody dependent 
cell-mediated cytotoxicity, ADCC).  
Erbitux is indicated for the treatment of patients with EGFR-expressing, KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma 
viral oncogene homologue) wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC): 
- in combination with irinotecan-based chemotherapy; 
- in first-line in combination with FOLFOX; 
- as a single agent in patients who have failed oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based therapy and who are 
intolerant to irinotecan. 
Erbitux is also indicated for the treatment of patients with squamous cell cancer of the head and neck 
(SCCHN): 
- in combination with radiation therapy for locally advanced disease; 
- in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for recurrent and/or metastatic disease. 
In all indications, Erbitux is administered once a week as intravenous infusion at a maximum rate of 10 
mg/min. The initial dose is 400 mg/m2, and all subsequent weekly doses are 250 mg/m2. 
With this variation application, the MAH proposed to further restrict the indication of Erbitux in 
colorectal cancer to the treatment of patients with RAS (i.e. both KRAS and NRAS) wild-type tumours. 
This was in follow-up to CHMP request after a similar recent restriction of the Vectibix colorectal cancer 
indication. Data strictly related to cetuximab in this application come from one study (OPUS) but 
further relevant data from studies CRYSTAL and FIRE III are expected (see further below).

2.2.  Clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The RAS gene family has three broadly expressed members: Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene 
homolog (KRAS), neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS), and the v-Ha-RAS Harvey rat 
sarcoma viral oncogene (HRAS). RAS (KRAS, NRAS, HRAS) proteins are central nodal points in these 
signalling pathways regulating the transmission of activation signals from the EGFR to down-stream 
effectors. The three different isoforms share sequence identity at all regions regulating activation state 
and effector functions, and high sequence similarity in most of the remaining gene. The region of 
variability between the isoforms, containing only 23 to 24 amino acids, is involved in membrane 
binding.  
Mutated, activated RAS proteins can bypass inhibition of EGFR by direct activation of the downstream 
pathways, MAPK and AKT pathways, independent of EGFR. KRAS exon 2 mutations at codons 12 and 
13 are the most frequently occurring RAS mutations in CRC (approximately 40% of subjects) and were 
demonstrated to be associated with resistance to anti-EGFR therapy in subjects with mCRC. Somatic 
mutations beyond KRAS exon 2, including KRAS exon 3 and 4 and NRAS exon 2, 3 and 4 mutations, 
have been documented in CRC and collectively occur in approximately 7% to 22% of wild-type KRAS 
exon 2 CRC cases. 
In this submission, results of the RAS mutational analysis and correlation with efficacy and safety 
were reported for the phase II OPUS trial, investigating cetuximab plus oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil (5-
FU), and leucovorin (FOLFOX4) versus FOLFOX4 alone. 
GCP 
The Clinical trial (OPUS) was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that the clinical trial (OPUS) conducted outside 
the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
2.3.  Clinical efficacy aspects 
2.3.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
The BEAMing (Beads, Emulsions, Amplification, and Magnetics) assay was chosen for the detection of 
KRAS and NRAS mutations in tumour samples from patients in the OPUS study due to the limited 
amount of starting material (genomic DNA isolated from one tissue slide). The BEAMing Technology 
combines polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with flow cytometry to create a mutation detection platform 
with greater sensitivity and specificity than traditional PCR. The technology allows for detection and 
quantification of low prevalence mutations and permits detection of mutations in heterogeneous or 
poor quality samples with rare mutated clones. 
The panel of KRAS and NRAS mutations analysed is presented in the following Table 1.

The number and percentage of patients per treatment arm of the OPUS study evaluable for RAS 
analysis and their disposition according to the RAS status of their tumours are presented in Table 2. 
Table 2: Number of patients with (K)RAS wild-Type and (K)RAS mutant tumour status 
+RAS mutant population includes patients with any KRAS exon 2 to 4 and NRAS exon 2 to 4 mutant tumours and 
thus also includes the patients originally identified as carriers of KRAS (i.e. exon 2 only) tumours 
The new RAS mutant population includes patients with KRAS exon 3 and 4 and NRAS exon 2 to 4 mutant tumours

2.3.3.  Discussion 
With regard to the numbers of tumour samples available for RAS analysis and the baseline 
demographic and disease characteristics of patients in the different subgroups (by RAS status), some 
of the subgroups were small, e.g. the interesting new RAS mutant; nevertheless, there were no major 
imbalances in prognostic factors. 
For tumour responses and except for the small group ‘new RAS mutant’, results were directionally as 
expected and the odds ratio seemed more favourable in the RAS wild type compared with KRAS wild 
type. In principle the same patterns were seen also for PFS, but PFS seemed neutral in the ‘new RAS 
mutant’ subgroup. Finally, OS results were compatible with PFS results taking into account the small 
sample sizes and diluting effects of post-progression survival.  
Of note, all comparisons were made without protection by stratification/randomisation, i.e. baseline 
imbalances within subgroups were to be expected, although no major imbalances of this type were 
observed. 
Currently available data on cetuximab formally only refer to the randomised phase II study OPUS, but 
the rationale based on tumour biology is strong and the conclusions are supported by data related to 
panitumumab.  
More data by RAS status specifically related to cetuximab are expected from the CRYSTAL and FIRE III 
studies, but the totality of data provides the evidence needed to restrict the indication as proposed by 
the MAH.    
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
• 
To submit the results of the CRYSTAL and FIRE III studies by RAS status

2.4.  Clinical safety aspects 
A summary of adverse events in subgroups defined by RAS tumour status is presented in the following 
Table 8. 
Table 8: Summary of adverse events during the treatment phase by RAS status 
As RAS mutation status refers to the tumour only, there were no good reasons to postulate differences 
in safety profiles related to RAS status other than from the perspective that patients with RAS wild 
type tumours would be treated for longer periods of time. Taking small sample sizes into account, the 
assumption that safety is independent of tumour RAS status was considered to be in-line with reported 
data. 
2.4.1.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The latest data lock point was 30 September 2013 (the PSUR being expected by 9 December 2013).  
The annex II related to the PSUR refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged.  
2.5.  Risk management plan 
No revised RMP was submitted in this variation. An updated RMP will be submitted when data from the 
CRYSTAL and FIRE III studies are submitted (see discussion on clinical efficacy).  
2.6.  Update of the Product information   
As a consequence of this restricted indication, sections 4.1 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. 
Additionally, the pre-existing posology recommendation, contraindication and warning in case of KRAS 
mutations have been amended in accordance in sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 of the SmPC. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template (version 
9.0), which were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
2.7.  Direct Healthcare Professional Communication 
The CHMP considered that a Direct Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC) was needed to 
communicate on the restriction of the colorectal cancer indication to patients with wild-type RAS 
tumour status, as inferior OS has been shown in patients with RAS mutations beyond KRAS exon 2 
who received Erbitux in combination with FOLFOX chemotherapy versus FOLFOX alone. 
The final version of this DHPC agreed by the CHMP is provided in Attachment 3 together with the 
communication plan. 
Erbitux 
Assessment report

The MAH should agree the translations and local specificities of the DHPC with national competent 
authorities. The DHPC should be sent upon receipt of the Commission Decision with the revised SmPC 
with the changes highlighted to oncologists who are expected to prescribe Erbitux, chief pharmacists, 
and pathologists responsible for testing tumour samples from metastatic colorectal cancer patients for 
RAS status. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Restricting the use of cetuximab to patients with metastatic colorectal cancer carrying RAS wild type 
tumours improves the benefit without negatively affecting the risk.   
Although cetuximab data by RAS status are only derived from the randomised phase II study OPUS, 
the biological rationale supporting the efficacy in patients with RAS wild type tumours only is strong 
and the conclusions are supported by data related to panitumumab. More data by RAS status 
specifically related to cetuximab are expected from the CRYSTAL and FIRE III studies, but the totality 
of current data already provides the evidence needed to restrict the Erbitux colorectal cancer indication 
to the treatment of patients with RAS (i.e. KRAS and NRAS) wild type tumours.    
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
• 
To submit the results of the CRYSTAL and FIRE III studies by RAS status

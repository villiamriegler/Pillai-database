2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a rare aggressive cancer of the blood and bone marrow. The majority 
of ALL cases are B-lineage, Philadelphia-negative ALL. There are approximately 6,300 new cases 
diagnosed in the European Union (EU) each year (based on Forman et al, 2014). Of these, 
approximately half are children. B-cell precursor ALL is the most common subtype of ALL, accounting 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/241758/2021  
Page 8/162 
 
 
 
 
 
for approximately 80% to 85% of total cases of ALL in children and approximately 70% in adults 
(American Cancer Society, 2015 and 2014). 
Among children with B-cell precursor ALL, more than 95% achieve a complete remission (CR) with 
front-line treatment, and 75% to 85% remain progression-free 5 years from initial diagnosis (Schrappe 
et al, 2013). However, approximately 15% to 20% of children with B-cell precursor ALL relapse after 
current front-line chemotherapy (Hunger et al, 2015). 
The International Study for Children and Adolescents with Relapsed ALL (IntReALL), formed in 2010, 
stratified this population into two distinct risk groups, standard risk and high risk, defined by 
established risk factors (IntReALL, 2017; Locatelli et al, 2012). Therefore, the high-risk first relapsed 
ALL patient population is defined as patients with very early relapse (< 18 months from initial 
diagnosis) at any anatomical site, early isolated bone marrow relapse (< 18 months after primary 
diagnosis and < 6 months from completion of front-line therapy), and/or MRD-positive disease. 
State the claimed therapeutic indication 
The purpose of this variation application is to request the following new indication:  
BLINCYTO as monotherapy for the treatment of paediatric patients aged 1 year or older with high-risk 
first relapsed Philadelphia chromosome negative CD19 positive B-precursor ALL as consolidation 
therapy. 
Management 
Treatment of high-risk first relapsed ALL generally includes 3 phases, including CNS prophylaxis and 
treatment: 
- Induction: The goal of induction therapy is to reduce tumor burden by clearing as many leukemic 
cells as possible from the bone marrow. Induction regimens are typically based on a standard 
backbone of therapy consisting of a combination of drugs including but not limited to: corticosteroids, 
vincristine, and anthracyclines with or without L-asparaginase and/or cyclophosphamide, 6-
mercaptopurine, and cytosine arabinoside. 
- Consolidation: The intent of post-induction consolidation is to eliminate potential leukemic cells that 
remain after induction therapy, thus permitting further eradication of residual disease. The 
combination of drugs and duration of therapy for consolidation regimens vary between studies and 
patient populations. 
- Allogeneic HSCT: Patients with poor outcome and high rates of subsequent relapse after conventional 
intensive chemotherapy have an indication for allogeneic HSCT from a matched or haplo-identical 
donor or in case of very high-risk also from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched donor. For a 
successful allogeneic HSCT, the depth of remission is critical, which may be the case after induction 
and early consolidation therapy. A low MRD value before allogeneic HSCT predicts a better outcome 
after the allograft (Bader et al, 2009). 
- CNS Prophylaxis and Treatment: The aim of CNS prophylaxis and/or treatment is to clear leukemic 
cells from sites that cannot be readily reached by systemic chemotherapy due to the blood-brain 
barrier, with the overall goal of preventing CNS disease or relapse. CNS specific therapy may include 
cranial irradiation and intrathecal chemotherapy (eg, methotrexate, either administered alone or in 
combination with cytarabine and steroids). CNS prophylaxis is typically given throughout the course of 
ALL therapy starting from induction and continuing through maintenance therapy.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/241758/2021  
Page 9/162 
 
 
 
In general, pediatric treatment regimens are more intense than those used in adults and include 
courses of combination chemotherapy, including central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis and 
treatment (eg, intrathecal chemotherapy with or without cranial radiation). 
Following induction and consolidation salvage therapy, high-risk first relapsed pediatric patients who 
still have M1 or M2 bone marrow and those who achieve CR but remain MRD-positive prior to 
allogeneic HSCT will likely experience another relapse. Approximately 44% of pediatric patients with 
second bone marrow relapse and only 27% of those with third bone marrow relapse achieve a 
subsequent CR; the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate in patients in third CR is reported to be 
15% (Ko et al, 2010). In addition, current treatment options rely heavily on aggressive chemotherapy 
regimens that are generally cytotoxic and may be poorly tolerated as manifested by severe nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue and may cause a range of toxicities including bone marrow 
suppression, cardiotoxicity, irreversible neuropathies, and renal toxicity. Finally, the toxicities 
associated with these treatments may adversely contribute to reduced effectiveness and increased 
treatment-related mortality of subsequent allogeneic HSCT. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Blinatumomab is a bispecific T-cell engager antibody construct that utilizes a patient’s own T cells to kill 
CD-19-positive B cells, including malignant B cells and which  binds specifically to CD19 expressed on 
the  surface  of  cells  of  B-lineage  origin  and  CD3  expressed  on  the  surface  of  T-cells.  It  activates 
endogenous T-cells by connecting CD3 in the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex with CD19 on benign and 
malignant B-cells.  
In the European Union (EU), blinatumomab (BLINCYTO) is currently indicated as: 
•  monotherapy for the treatment of adults with CD19 positive relapsed or refractory B-precursor 
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive B-
precursor ALL should have failed treatment with at least 2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and 
have no alternative treatment options. 
•  monotherapy for the treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome negative CD19 positive 
B-precursor ALL in first or second complete remission with minimal residual disease (MRD) 
greater than or equal to 0.1% 
•  monotherapy for the treatment of paediatric patients aged 1 year or older with Philadelphia 
chromosome negative CD19 positive B-precursor ALL which is refractory or in relapse after 
receiving at least two prior therapies or in relapse after receiving prior allogeneic 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No new data have been submitted to environmental risk assessment. According to the CHMP 2006 
Guideline on the environment Risk Assessment of Medicinal Product for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2), in the case of proteins or peptide, due to their nature they are 
unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment. As recombinant non-glycosylated protein, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/241758/2021  
Page 10/162 
 
 
 
blinatumomab is expected to be degraded to small peptides and individual amino acids. Although the 
current variation may result in an increase in the total amount of blinatumomab used, due to its 
structure, it is not expected to result in a significant risk to environment. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Based on the accepted justification submitted in this application, the extended indication does not lead 
to a significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of blinatumomab.  
Considering the above data, blinatumomab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Introduction 
To support this new indication, a phase 3, randomized, open label, controlled, multicentre study 
20120215 was performed (in accordance to the PIP, EMEA-000574-PIP02-12-M03) in paediatric 
patients as shown in Table 2.

Page 12/162 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 1: Core clinical study for Blinatumomab efficacy and safety assessment for Study 
20120215 
The claimed dosing regimen for paediatric patients for this new indication consisted of: 
-  Weight less than 45 kg (BSA-based dose): 15 µg/m2/day (not to exceed 28 µg/day) 
-  Weight greater than 45 kg (fixed dose): 28 µg/day 
Descriptive PK statistics from study 20120215 were provided. In addition, one PopPK model was 
developed using available PK data from adults (for other indications) and paediatric patients (for the 
claimed and other indication). Two exposure-response (ER) analysis were also submitted: ER efficacy 
and safety.  
Methods 
• 
Analytical methods 
Blinatumomab serum concentration 
A validated bioassay was used to quantify serum blinatumomab concentrations. The assay is based on 
the principle that the CD69 activation marker is expressed on T cells in a blinatumomab concentration 
dependent manner, therefore the assay measures “active form” of blinatumomab. Briefly, nominal 
standard ranged from 0 to 200 ng/mL (9 levels), with 3 QC samples (150/450 and 900 pg/mL). 
Nominal assay ranged from 50 to 1000 pg/mL (LLOQ to ULOQ).  
A total of 28 analytical runs were performed for this study. Every analytical run met acceptance 
criteria. Samples were received between February 2016 to November 2019. 175 samples were 
received from which 98 were analysed. 
ISR is excluded from this study because it has been already performed in the context of clinical study 
MT103-205 which represent the same patient population as 20120215 and uses the same assay. 
Method acceptance criteria are presented in  
Table 4 below. As shown below PK samples were determined in triplicates.

Table 2: Bioassay for the quantification of blinatumomab across the clinical development 
Table 3: Method acceptance criteria 
Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity was assessed by a validated electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-based bridging 
immunoassay to determine if anti-idiotype antibodies directed against blinatumomab and/or human 
anti-mouse antibodies were detectable. The methodology of antibody testing was provided in the 
original marketing authorization application for adult relapsed/refractory ALL. 
• 
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Standard non-compartmental (model independent) pharmacokinetic methods were used to calculate 
PK parameters, Css (steady-state serum concentrations as the observed concentrations collected after 
24 hours from the start of cIV) andCL (systemic clearance calculated as CL=R0/Css, with R0 the rate 
of infusion) using Phoenix® WinNonlin® v.6.4 software (CertaraTM, Princeton, NJ). 
In addition to CL, Vz and half-life were also estimated. CL and Vz were expressed in L/h and L 
respectively, and normalized by BSA as L/h/m2 and L/m2, respectively. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/241758/2021  
Page 14/162 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Blinatumomab PK data collected from Study 20120215 in conjunction with PK data from other relevant 
studies (please refer to Population PK analysis section) were pooled to develop a Population PK model 
using the Nonmem 7.2 (ICON Development Solutions, Ellicot City, MD) software.  
Exposure-response (ER) analysis for efficacy and safety were also performed using the PK exposure 
metrics estimated by NCA. For efficacy, the ER analysis included time to event analysis for EFS and OS 
using Cox proportional hazard models. For safety, ER were investigated using univariate and 
multivariate logistic regression models using R version 3.0.1 or higher. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Pivotal Study 20120215 (high-risk relapsed) 
Design 
Study 20120215 is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, controlled, multicentre study investigating the 
efficacy and safety profile of blinatumomab versus intensive SOC late consolidation, in paediatric 
patients aged > 28 days to < 18 years with high risk first relapsed B-cell precursor ALL. 
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the blinatumomab arm or a third block of SOC high-
risk consolidation chemotherapy arm (HC3 arm). Randomization was stratified by age, bone marrow 
status determined at the end of the second block of SOC chemotherapy, and MRD status determined at 
the end of induction.  
Six strata were formed from the following 2 age categories (1 to 9 years; other [< 1 year and > 9 
years]) and 3 bone marrow/MRD categories (M1 with MRD level ≥ 10-3; M1 with MRD level < 10-3; and 
M2), where M1 was defined as representative bone marrow aspirate or biopsy with blasts < 5%, with 
satisfactory cellularity, and with regenerating hematopoiesis, and M2 was defined as representative 
bone marrow aspirate or biopsy with 5% to < 25% blasts. 
After the screening period, eligible subjects were randomized into 1 of the following treatment arms: 
•  Blinatumomab arm with 1 consolidation cycle of blinatumomab, defined as a 4 weeks cIV 
(continuous infusion) of 15 µg/m2/day (maximum dose not to exceed 28 µg/day), or 
•  HC3 arm with 1 consolidation cycle of HC3, defined as 1 week on/ 3 weeks off 
PK sampling consisted of 2 PK samples per subject collected at Day 1 and Day 15 (at least 10h after 
infusion start and up to 24h). 
Results 
Study 20120215 is ongoing. At the cut-off date of 17 July 2019, a total of 108 eligible subjects were 
enrolled and randomized; both arms had 54 subjects. 
During cIV infusion of 15 µg/m2/day blinatumomab to pediatric subjects, the mean (SD) serum 
blinatumomab concentration at steady state (Css) was 921 (1010) pg/mL ( 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/241758/2021  
Page 15/162 
 
 
 
 
Table 5). The mean (SD) clearance (CL) was 0.998 (0.450) L/hr/m2. The intersubject variability, as 
assessed by percent coefficient of variation (CV) in the PK parameter estimates, was up to 109%. 
Given the high observed intersubject variability in this study, mean (SD) Css and CL of blinatumomab 
were generally within the ranges of those previously reported in pediatric subjects from Studies 
MT103-205 and 20130265 (please refer to next section).

Results 
Study MT103-205 
Blinatumomab serum concentrations were available in total of 48 subjects including 8 subjects < 2 years 
of age, 23 subjects 2 to 6 years of age, and 17 subjects 7 to 17 years of age. The PK of blinatumomab 
was assessed at doses of 5, 15, and 30 µg/m2/day. 
Following  the  cIV  infusion,  Css  was  presumed  on  day  1  based  on  the  estimated  average  half-life  of 
blinatumomab (~2 hours). At a given dose, the Css was stable over time (figure 1) and the drug exposure 
was  comparable  over  cycles  1  and  2  (Table  7).  The  mean  Css  values  increased  proportionally  with 
increasing doses indicating linear PK. In cycle 1, the mean (SD) Css values were 162 (179), 533 (392), 
and 1520 (1020) pg/mL for doses of 5, 15, and 30 µg/m2/day, respectively, for the combined age group 
(≤ 17 years), independent of regimen. The inter-subject variability values for Css were large, ranging 
from 60.8% to 110.5% in the combined group. A summary of Css values by dose, cycle, and age group 
is presented in Table 7.

combined age group (≤ 17 years). The mean (SD) blinatumomab clearance was similar in the ≤ 2 years 
(1.57 [0.435] L/hr/m2), 2 to 6 years (2.28 [2.47] L/hr/m2) and 7 to 17 years (1.49 [1.38] L/hr/m2) 
age  groups.  The  intersubject  variability  in  PK  parameter  estimates  (Vz,  t1/2,z  and  CL)  were  large, 
ranging from 70.1% to 101.2% in the combined group. Since no ADA was found in pediatric patients, 
the effect of ADA on PK was not evaluated.

Study 20130265 
Blinatumomab was administered via continuous IV infusions of 9 and 28 µg/day to adult subjects and of 
5 and  15 µg/m2/day to pediatric subjects with relapsed/refractory B-cell precursor ALL.  As shown in 
Table 9, blinatumomab mean (SD) values of Css in cycle 1 were 191 (90.8) pg/mL and 948 (488) pg/mL 
for the 9- and 28-µg/day dosage in adults, and 113 (65.0) pg/mL and 361 (137) pg/mL for the 5- and 
15-µg/m2/day dosage in pediatrics, respectively. The mean (SD) clearance was 1.59 (0.812) L/hour in 
adults  and  1.88  (0.789)  L/m2/hour  in  pediatric  subjects.  Mean  (SD)  Css  and  systemic  clearance  of 
blinatumomab in Japanese subjects in this study were within the range of those previously reported in 
adult and pediatric subjects in global clinical studies.

The observed mean Css value of 361 pg/mL for Japanese paediatric subjects at the 15 µg/m2/day dose 
level and 948 pg/mL for Japanese adult subjects at the 28 µg/day dose level (fixed dose equivalent to 
15 µg/m2/day) are impacted by the PK variability of blinatumomab with a coefficient of variation (CV) 
up to 52% (Table 10 and Table 11). With limited data available in 7 Japanese paediatric subjects, all but 
1  (86%)  had  Css  values  within  range  of  the  Css  values  from  Japanese  adult  subjects  (Figure  2).

At a dose of 15 µg/m2/day dose, the observed mean Css value of Japanese pediatric subjects in Study 
20130265 were approximately 1.5-fold lower than that of global pediatric subjects in Study MT103-205 
(Table 12).

Table 12. Fold Difference in Mean Css Exposure Between Japan Study 20130265 and Global 
Studies for Pediatric and Adult Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory ALL. 
The 1.5-fold difference in observed mean Css values between Japanese and global paediatric subjects is 
impacted by PK variability with CV up to 73.6%.  The mean values of the subject groups are impacted 
by  the  extreme  values  observed,  resulting  in  the  observed  fold  difference  for  mean  Css  (Figure  3).  
Consistent with the Css exposures, the observed CL values in Japanese pediatric subjects were within 
range of those in global pediatric subjects (Table 10 and Figure 5).    
Likewise, the blinatumomab PK parameters for Japanese adult subjects with relapsed or refractory ALL 
are within range of those of corresponding adult subjects with relapsed or refractory ALL in the global 
studies.  At a dose of 28 µg/day dose, the observed mean Css value of Japanese adult subjects in Study 
20130265  were  approximately  1.4  to  1.6-fold  higher  than  that  of  global  adult  subjects  in  3  clinical 
studies, MT103-211, 00103311, and 20120216 (Table 12). When combining the Css values across the 
3  global  studies,  the  fold  difference  relative  to  Japanese  subjects  is  approximately  1.5-fold.    This 
difference is impacted by PK variability for Css in both groups with CV up to 88% (Table 11).  In addition, 
the mean values of the subject groups are impacted by the extreme values in both groups, resulting in 
the observed fold difference for mean Css (Figure 6).  Consistent with the Css exposures, the observed 
CL values in Japanese adult subjects were within range of those in corresponding global subjects (Table 
11 and Figure 7).    
PK across different populations 
The PK of blinatumomab (Css) in pediatric subjects with relapsed/refractory or high-risk first relapsed 
ALL along with those estimated in adult  subjects with relapsed/refractory ALL, MRD-positive ALL and 
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) are presented in table 13 and table 14, respectively.

Css can be attained within a day and is stable over treatment cycles in both pediatric and adult subjects 
as shown in Table and Table, respectively. Mean Css values increased approximately dose proportionally 
over the dose range tested in both subject populations. The variability in Css was large in both paediatric 
and adult subjects regardless of BSA-based dosing or fixed dosing. 
Blinatumomab PK in paediatric subjects were characterized in two distinct populations: (1) subjects with 
high-risk  first  relapsed  ALL  who  received  induction  therapy  and  2  blocks  of  high-risk  consolidation 
chemotherapy prior to blinatumomab treatment in the third consolidation course and had < 25% blasts 
in bone marrow at enrollment in Study 20120215 and (2) subjects with relapsed/refractory ALL (defined 
as one of the following: second or later bone marrow relapse, any marrow relapse after allogeneic HSCT, 
or refractory to other treatments) with > 25% blasts in the bone marrow for Study MT103- 205 or > 5%

blasts  in  the  bone  marrow  for  Study  20130265  where  chemotherapy  was  not  required  prior  to 
blinatumomab  treatment.  Given  these  differences,  the  mean  (SD)  Css  at  15  µg/m2/day  and  CL  of 
blinatumomab in paediatric subjects from Study 20120215 were generally within the ranges of those 
previously  reported  in  pediatric  subjects  from  Studies  MT103-205  and  20130265  when  taking  into 
consideration the high observed inter-subject variability. 
Across the 3 clinical studies in paediatric subjects, BSA-based doses were tested over a dose range from 
5 to 30 µg/m2/day. Based on non-compartmental analysis, the estimated mean (coefficient of variation 
[CV%]) Vz was 4.14 (80.3%) L/m2, indicating that blinatumomab is mainly distributed in the vascular 
space.  As  a  therapeutic  protein,  blinatumomab  is  likely  cleared  mainly  via  the  normal  catabolic 
degradation  to  small  peptides  and  individual  amino  acids  (Lin,  2009).  The  estimated  mean  (CV%) 
clearance (CL) under BSA-based dosing was 1.50 (94.9%) L/m2/hr, and the mean (SD) t1/2,z was 2.14 
(1.44) hours, which was similar to the mean (SD) value for adults (2.19 [1.39] hours). Due to the fast 
CL of blinatumomab, cIV infusion is required during the treatment to maintain therapeutic concentrations 
in the systemic circulation.

Model development 
The analysis was conducted using PK data from a previous published PopPK model (Model 1) where PK 
data were retrieved from several clinical studies performed in adult and pediatric (MT103-104, MT103-
202, MT103-203, MT103-206, MT103-211, MT103-205, 20120216 and 00103311).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/241758/2021  
Page 34/162 
 
 
 
 
 
This previous PopPK model was updated with PK data from studies 20120215 and 20130265 (Model 2). 
The concentration-time data of blinatumomab was modelled using a compartmental approach. 
Covariates of interest in blinatumomab trials included were demographic factors (age, BSA, weight, sex, 
race), liver function tests (ALB, Total BILI), disease status (LDH and Hb), and baseline rating of bone 
marrow  blast  percentage(using  standard  classification  of  M1,  M2  and  M3  as  bone  marrow  biopsy  or 
aspirate with < 5% blasts, 5 to < 25%, and ≥ 25% blasts respectively). 
The PopPK model was built using nonlinear mixed effects model with the first order conditional estimation 
with interaction method (FOCEI) in Nonmem 7 (version 7.2, ICON Development Solutions, Maryland). 
Covariates effects were first explored graphically, where the individual Bayesian post-hoc PK parameters 
were plotted against covariates. Then, testing of the covariate effects was performed using a standard 
stepwise forward/backward elimination method. The criterion for retention was a change in likelihood 
ratio  >  10.83  for  1  parameter  (p<  0.001).  Then  the  PopPK  models  were  evaluated  using  standard 
diagnostic plots, and pcVPC.  
Results 
The combined PK dataset includes 4043 serum samples from 760 pediatric and adult subjects across 10 
studies (Model 2). 
The  index  PK  dataset  consisted  of  PK  data  from  study  20120215  (Pivotal  Phase  3  study)  and  study 
20130265  in  Japanese  subjects  (adult  and  pediatric).  The  index  PK  dataset  consisted  of  547  serum 
samples from 120 adult and pediatric subjects receiving blinatumomab cIV infusion. 
According to data, there were: 
• 
7 pre-dose samples and 59 (11%) post-dose samples below the LLOQ that were excluded 
•  After these exclusions, 34 subjects did not have any post-dose PK samples above the LLOQ and 
were excluded from the analysis 
• 
Further,  serum  samples  beyond  90  day  post-start  of  first  blinatumomab  infusion  period  (45 
samples) were excluded. 
The  final  index  dataset  of  paediatric  and  adult  subjects  from  these  two  studies  included  436  serum 
samples from 86 subjects. A PopPK model with only these data was developed (Model 3). 
An overview of the demographic covariates is provided in table 18 below. Figure 8 display the individual

First a simulation based exercise was performed using a VPC from model 1 to check if it was able to 
adequately predict the central tendency and variability of the observed PK data from studies 20120215 
and 20130265. Result from this exercise is displayed in figure 9 and show the inadequacy of its predictive 
performance particularly on PK data from study 20120215 along the time interval and at earlier/later

tendency  and  associated  variability  of  blinatumomab  serum  concentrations  for  the  new  dataset,  the 
previous model was updated by using a combined dataset of 760 subjects from 10 studies.

The final model is described as a one-compartment linear pharmacokinetic model and was parameterized 
in terms of systemic CL and  V. An exponential inter-individual variability term was estimated for CL. 
Residual variability was modeled using an additive error model in the log-domain.

Figure 14. CL vs continuous covariates 
The effects of baseline bone marrow blast percentage may be confounded by study-specific effects and 
demographics in each study population. Adult and pediatric subjects with M1 bone marrow showed lower 
CL compared to M3 bone marrow, however subjects in  M1  bone marrow were primarily composed of 
pediatric subjects and thus associated with lower BSA. A comparison of two pediatric studies with one 
composed of subjects primarily with M1 bone marrow (Study 20120215, mean BSA = 1.05 m2) and the 
other composed of subjects primarily with M3 bone marrow (Study MT103-205, mean BSA = 0.87 m2) 
revealed  similar  CL  values  (mean  CL  1.4  L/hr  vs.  1.5  L/hr),  therefore  baseline  bone  marrow  blast 
percentage was not considered as a covariate on CL. 
The results from the exploratory graphical and statistical analysis between the random effect of model 
parameters  and  the  covariates  evaluated  in  the  combined  dataset  did  not  reveal  any  remaining 
significant trend that explain more than 10% of the estimated between subject variability. Consequently, 
the final model did not include additional covariate effects other than BSA effect on CL.

Simulations of exposures between 15 µg/m2/day vs 28 µg/day in paediatric population patients with high 
risk first relapsed ALL for subjects ≥ 45 kg administered by cIV infusion 
Figure 15 shows the simulated blinatumomab steady state concentration (Css) in pediatric patients with 
body weight ≥ 45 kg administered a body surface area (BSA)-based dose of 15 µg/m2/day versus a fixed 
dose of  28 µg/day using the updated population pharmacokinetic (PPK) model (Report 153930). The 
BSA values for the pediatric subjects included in this simulation were based on weight, age, and height 
from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2017-2018 demographic and body 
measurement  datasets.  The  figure  shows  both  dosing  regimens  resulted  in  similar  Css  in  pediatric 
subjects ≥ 45 kg.   
For the initial PPK model, other residual unexplained variability (RUV) models were not tested. Check on 
a combined error model (additive + proportional) for the updated PPK model found that the additional 
additive error term did not improve the variability estimates.   
To further evaluate the predictive performance of the updated PPK model, prediction corrected visual 
predicted  checks  (pcVPCs)  of  the  updated  PPK  model,  split  by  study,  are  provided  in  Figure  16. 
Additionally, a pcVPC for Study 20120215 alone with a different binning was presented for clarity (Figure

Figure 17. Prediction-Corrected visual Predictive Check of the Updated PPK Model for study 
20120215 
Inclusion of inter-occasion variability (IOV) was not considered during model development under the 
applicant’s consideration that pcVPCs demonstrated minimal bias and IOV may have limited ability to 
improve model predictions  for pediatric  subjects, as all PK samples were collected during cycle 1 for 
Study  20120215,  and  estimation  of  IOV  across  studies  would  be  confounded  with  study-specific 
differences.   
The  evaluation  of  baseline  blasts  as  a  continuous  PK  covariate  was  not  feasible  as  baseline  blast 
numerical values were not collected in a significant portion of our population dataset (available in only 
52% of pediatric subjects). While the effect of baseline blasts on PK could not be evaluated, the effects 
of the baseline rating of bone marrow blasts (category M1, M2, or M3) in the pediatric subject population 
was explored. The relationship between interindividual variability (IIV) in blinatumomab clearance (CL) 
and baseline rating of bone marrow blast category is presented in Figure 4. Note that only one subject 
in the pediatric population had a baseline rating of M2.  
The PPK model have also been re-estimated using pediatric subjects only as requested. The parameter 
values from the PPK model based on pediatric subjects alone are presented in Table 1 alongside the 
parameter values for the updated PPK model from Report 153930.  The CL for a typical subject from the 
pediatric subject population is 1.28 L/hr.  Note that the median BSA for the pediatric subject population 
is 0.968 m2.  Based on the PPK model using pediatric  subjects, the CL for a typical  subject from the 
combined adult and pediatric subject population with a median BSA of 1.753 m2 is 1.84 L/hr, only a 15% 
decrease from the previous estimate of 2.16 L/hr.  The estimated volume of central compartment (V) of 
3.35 L is for a typical pediatric subject with BSA of 0.968 m2; on a per m2 basis, V is only 5.4% lower 
than the typical  V estimated using the  combined adult and pediatric population for BSA of  1.753 m2.

The IIV on CL decreased for the PPK model using pediatric subjects compared to the updated PPK model, 
but  the  residual  variability  increased.    The  15%  difference  in  CL  between  the  two  models  is  small 
compared to the 30.1% IIV in CL.  Additionally, review of the pcVPC of the PPK model using pediatric 
subjects stratified by study shows that the pediatric-only PPK model performs similarly to the updated 
PPK model (Figure 19).   
The  PPK  model  based  on  pediatric  subjects  was  used  to  simulate  the  steady  state  concentrations  in 
pediatric subjects ≥ 45 kg after a continuous infusion of either 28 μg/day or 15 μg/m2/day (Figure 20).  
Simulated Css based on the PPK model using pediatric subjects and simulated Css based on the updated 
PPK model are reported  in Figure 15.

Table 21. Estimated Blinatumuab PK Parameters Using Pediatric Subjects Only 
•  Special populations 
The effects of demographics factors on the blinatumomab PK were evaluated using individual estimated 
clearance  retrieve  from  the  NCA  approach.  Additional  assessment  to  quantify  these  effects  was 
performed with the PopPK analysis. 
Relationship between weight, BSA, age, race and gender and CL of Blinatumomab were investigated at 
the paediatric population level (figure 21), and at both the paediatric and adult population (Figure 22) 
•  Weight 
No  formal  PK  study  was  performed  to  investigate  the  potential  effect  of  weight  on  the  PK  of 
blinatumomab. The body weight ranged from 7.5 to 76.6 kg in the paediatric population, and from 7.5 
to 149 kg for the full dataset. Figure 21 and 22. 
•  BSA 
No formal PK study was performed to investigate the potential effect of BSA on the PK of blinatumomab. 
The BSA ranged from 0.367 to 1.99 m2 in the paediatric population, and from 0.367 to 2.70 m2 for the 
full dataset (figure 21 and 22). Based on the PopPK analysis, only BSA was found to have a significant 
effect on CL. Blinatumomab CL for the lowest BSA of subjects ≥ 45 kg of 1.3 m2 compared to a median 
BSA of 1.85 m2 is associated with a 22% reduction, and systemic CL for the highest BSA of 2.7 m2 is 
associated with a 31% increase. However, the magnitude of this effect is relatively low compared to the 
53%  unexplained  between-subject  variability  in  CL  and  the  34%  residual  variability  that  had  a  52% 
between-subject variability in blinatumomab pharmacokinetics. Therefore, dose adjustments in patients 
≥ 45 kg based on BSA do not appear to be necessary. 
•  Age, gender, race 
The age ranged from 0 to 17 years in the pediatric population, and from 0 to 85 years for the full dataset. 
There were 78 White subjects, 9 Japanese, 3 Hispanic/latino, 1 non-Japanese Asian and 3 other races, 
in the pediatric population and, 570 White subjects, 35 Japanese, 82 Hispanic/latino, 24 non-Japanese 
Asian,  43  other  races  and  13  Black  or  African  American  for  the  full  dataset.  There  were  48/46

Immunogenicity assessment 
None of the 132 paediatric subjects tested were positive for anti-blinatumomab antibodies from Study 
20120215 (48 subjects tested), Study MT 103-205 (75 subjects tested), and Study 20130265 (9 subjects 
tested). These results are consistent with the low incidence of immunogenicity  observed across adult 
studies with 1.4% (9 out of 663) of adult subjects showed binding or neutralizing ADA. 
• 
Effect of baseline rating bone marrow blast percentage on Pharmacokinetic 
Morphologic evidence of tumor burden in ALL subjects was assessed by percentage of blasts in the bone 
marrow  at  baseline.  The  effect  of  baseline  rating  of  bone  marrow  blast  percentage  on  the  CL  of 
blinatumomab  was  assessed  across  the  3  clinical  studies  in  pediatric  subjects  with  ALL:  Studies 
20120215, MT103-205, and 20130265 (Figure). Baseline rating of bone marrow blast percentage was 
reported in subjects according to the standard classification: M1, < 5% blasts; M2, 5% to < 25% blasts; 
M3, ≥ 25% blasts.  
As shown in figure 23, the level of blast infiltration in bone marrow at baseline did not show an apparent 
effect on drug clearance in pediatric subjects.

Figure 23: Effect of baseline rating bone marrow blast percentage on blinatumomab clearance 
in paediatric subject 
Statistical  analyses  were  conducted  using  the  Wilcoxon  non-parametric  test  comparing  the 
blinatumomab clearance (CL) values of subjects with baseline bone marrow blasts below 5% (M1) and 
those with baseline blasts at or above 5% (M2/M3). The results indicated that there is a low probability 
that the groups differ by chance. Similar statistical results are observed when comparing CL values of 
subjects with M1 bone marrow and those with M3 bone marrow (≥25% blasts) at baseline (ie., removing 
the 1 M2 subject from the analysis).

In addition, based on the PopPK analysis, the applicant states that the effect of baseline bone marrow 
blast  percentage  may  be  confounded  by  study  specific  effects  and  demographics  in  each  study 
population. Adult and pediatric subjects with M1 bone marrow showed lower CL compared to M3 bone 
marrow; however, subjects with M1 bone marrow were primarily composed of pediatric  subjects and 
thus associated with lower BSA.  
A comparison of two pediatric studies with one  composed of subjects primarily with M1 bone marrow 
(Study 20120215, mean BSA = 1.05 m2) and the other composed of subjects primarily with M3 bone 
marrow (study MT103-205, mean BSA = 0.87 m2) revealed similar CL values (mean CL 1.4 L/hr vs. 1.5 
L/hr); therefore, baseline bone marrow blast percentage was not considered as a covariate on CL. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Pharmacodynamic assessments were not conducted in Study 20120215; therefore, the PD effect of 
blinatumomab in paediatric subjects is not discussed in this assessment report. The previous variation 
application for paediatric subjects with relapsed/refractory ALL in 2018 provides a description of 
blinatumomab PD in paediatric subjects (EMEA/H/C/003731/II/0018). 
Exposure-response Relationships 
Relationships between blinatumomab Css from the target dosing regimen and the primary and 
secondary efficacy endpoints of EFS and OS, respectively, and adverse events of CRS, neurological 
events, and infections were explored in pediatric subjects with high-risk first relapsed B-cell precursor 
ALL treated with blinatumomab (Study 20120215). Considering that there was only 1 dosing cohort, 
Study 20120215 is inadequate to make conclusions about the exposure-response relationships for 
blinatumomab in these subjects.  
Immunogenicity 
None of the 132 paediatric subjects tested were positive for anti-blinatumomab antibodies from Study 
20120215 (48 subjects tested), Study MT103-205 (75 subjects tested), and Study 20130265 (9 
subjects tested). These results are consistent with the low incidence (1.4%) of immunogenicity 
observed across adult studies 
2.3.4.   PK/PD modelling 
The objectives of this analysis were to investigate the relationship between blinatumomab exposure and 
efficacy endpoints (duration of EFS and OS) or safety events (occurrence of CRS, neurologic events, and 
infections, and time to neurologic events) in paediatric subjects with high-risk first relapsed B-precursor 
ALL  receiving  blinatumomab  or  standard  of  care  (SOC)  chemotherapy  as  consolidation  therapy  after 
induction therapy.

Methodology 
Time to event analysis were conducted using Cox proportional hazard models and the hazard ratios 
and respective 95 th CIs are presented.

Duration of EFS and OS were considered as PD endpoints for exploratory purposes where Css 
(tabulated by quartiles) was available. Baseline covariates (age, weight, BSA, sex, blood counts, 
genetic abnormalities, extramedullar disease) were also tabulated by quartiles. 
Results 
Of the 108 subjects enrolled 54 received blinatumomab (and 54 HC3). From the 54 subjects, only 40 
Css at Day 15 receiving 15 µg/m2/day. (table 23, 24 and 25)

Methodology 
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression model and the odds ratio and respective 95th CIs were 
performed, in addition to Cox proportional hazard models. 
PK data 
Observed Blinatumomab Css was selected as the exposure metric to be investigated given the large 
RUV and high between subjects as evident from the PopPK analysis.  
PD data 
CRS (cytokine release syndrome), neurological (and time event to event analysis) and infections 
events were considered. 
Results 
In  40  subjects  with  blinatumomab  Css,  exploratory  exposure-safety  analysis  indicates  no  difference 
between Css in subjects with or without a safety event of any grade for CRS, neurological events, and 
infections (figure 25). Further details of the univariate analysis for each safety event is presented below.

The proportion of subjects with CRS events of any grade was  5% (2 of  40 subjects) in the pediatric 
subjects  with  blinatumomab  Css.  There  was  no  grade  ≥3  CRS  event  in  the  40  subjects  with 
blinatumomab Css. Due to the  small number of events,  univariate analysis exploring the association 
between  exposure  and  the  occurrence  of  CRS  of  any  grade  did  not  find  any  significant  association 
between blinatumomab Css and the occurrence of CRS. 
Neurological events 
The proportion of subjects with at least 1 neurologic event of any grade was 45% (18 of 40 subjects) in 
the pediatric subjects with blinatumomab Css, however only 1 event (2.5%) was grade ≥3. Univariate 
analysis exploring the association between exposure and neurologic events of any grade suggested that 
blinatumomab Css was not associated with occurrence of neurologic events (table 28), or the time to 
neurologic events (hazard ratio =  1.222  per log[pg/mL], 95% CI:  0.567–2.634 per log[pg/mL], p = 
0.608). Higher age was associated with higher occurrence of neurological events (odds ratio per age 
year = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.07–1.31 per year, p =0.001). Multivariate analysis with treatment and age also 
suggests higher occurrence of neurological events with higher age (table 29).

Infections 
The proportion of subjects with at least 1 infection of any grade was 42.5% (17 of 40 subjects) in the 
pediatric  subjects  with  blinatumomab  Css,  with  15%  (6  of  40  subjects)  categorized  as  grade  ≥3. 
Univariate analysis suggested that blinatumomab Css was not associated with occurrence of infections 
of  any  grade  or  grade  ≥3  (Table  25).  No  significant  associations  were  found  between  occurrence  of 
infections and the covariates tested in the univariate analyses.  
Dose rationale 
The rationale for the clinical dose selection for consolidation therapy of blinatumomab for the treatment 
of high-risk first relapsed ALL after induction therapy was based mainly on the totality of PK, efficacy, 
and safety information. The recommended dose regimen for this population is 15 µg/m2/day for subjects 
< 45 kg and 28 µg/day for subjects ≥ 45 kg administered by cIV infusion. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/241758/2021  
Page 61/162 
 
 
 
 
 
The  dose  tested  in  Study  20120215  in  paediatric  patients  with  high-risk  first  relapsed  ALL  was  15 
µg/m2/day  with  a  maximum  daily  dose  not  to  exceed  28  µg/day,  whereas  the  dose  in  previous 
blinatumomab pediatric studies, Studies MT103-205 and 20130265, was 15 µg/m2/day (no maximum 
dose defined). Although an equivalent fixed dose regimen of 28 µg/day was not specified for subjects ≥ 
45 kg in Study 20120215,  similar exposure levels are expected with either the  BSA-based  dosing or 
fixed dosing at an equivalent dose. Similar exposure levels were observed in subjects ≥ 45 kg given the 
15 µg/m2/day dose in subjects across all pediatric studies and 28 µg/day dose in adults regardless of 
indication (figure 26 and Table 30). In addition, the relationship between blinatumomab clearance (CL) 
values and body weight in subjects ≥ 45 kg was analyzed from PK data pooled from adult and pediatric 
subjects with relapsed/refractory ALL or high-risk first relapsed ALL (figure 27). The analyses indicate 
that body weight is not a sensitive factor affecting blinatumomab CL in subjects ≥ 45 kg regardless of 
age. 
Therefore, comparable exposures of blinatumomab in subjects ≥  45 kg are expected when receiving 
either a fixed dose or BSA-based dose. Body surface area has been identified as the only covariate to 
have  a  significant  effect  on  CL  based  on  population  PK  modeling  of  blinatumomab  PK  in  adult  and 
pediatric subjects that included the impact of covariates such as demographic factors, organ function, 
and disease status on PK parameters. However, the BSA covariate effect was minimal, with a ≤  31% 
change in CL over the range of BSA values in the combined population of pediatric and adult subjects ≥ 
45 kg (1.3–2.7 m2), relative to the median BSA (1.85 m2) in this population. In addition, the magnitude 
of this effect is relatively low compared to the 53% unexplained between-subject variability in CL and 
the 34% residual variability that had a 52% between-subject variability in blinatumomab PK. Therefore, 
dose adjustments in pediatric patients ≥ 45 kg based on BSA do not appear to be necessary.

From safety and efficacy perspectives, the dose of 15 µg/m2/day (maximum daily dose not to exceed 
28 µg/day) was found to be safe and effective for the treatment of high-risk first relapsed ALL pediatric 
subjects with a reduced tumor burden of < 25% blasts in the bone marrow (M1 and M2 bone marrow) 
in consolidation therapy after induction therapy in Study 20120215.

In pediatric relapsed/refractory ALL, the recommended dose for the first cycle of treatment is a starting 
dose of 5 µg/m2/day (or 9 µg/day for subjects ≥ 45 kg) with escalation to 15 µg/m2/day (or 28 µg/day 
for subjects ≥ 45 kg) after one week to avoid CRS associated with high tumor burden. No step-dosing 
was needed in Study 20120215 as in the treatment in relapsed/refractory ALL, mainly because the tumor 
burden and related CRS events was low in the setting of consolidation after induction for the treatment 
of high-risk first relapsed ALL. 
This rationale is identical to that of the recommended dosing for subjects with MRD positive ALL with 
similar  reduced  tumor  burden  and  related  CRS  risk  profile.  Given  that  comparable  exposures  are 
expected between fixed dosing and BSA-based dosing for subjects ≥ 45 kg, fixed dosing of 28 µg/day 
can be recommended for pediatric subjects ≥ 45 kg due to logistical advantages with fixed dosing such 
as  ease  of  administration,  reduced  risk  of  dosing  errors,  minimal  preparation  by  hospital  staff  and 
reduced  patient  waiting  time.  In  addition,  BSA-based  dosing  of  15  µg/m2/day  is  recommended  for 
pediatric subjects ≥ 45 kg to avoid excessive Css exposures. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Blinatumomab is currently approved for the treatment of Philadelphia-chromosome negative 
relapsed/refractory B-cell precursor ALL (R/R ALL) in adult and paediatric subjects and in MRD in 
adults only. The pharmacokinetics have been well characterized in adult and pediatric patients in R/R 
ALL. 
The current Type II variation of extension of the indication of Blinatumomab in the paediatric 
population (1 to < 18 years) with high-risk first relapsed Ph- B-cell precursor ALL, have been 
addressed according to the paediatric investigation part of Blinatumomab clinical development (EMEA-
000574-PIP02-12-M03). In support of this application, the applicant conducted a Phase 3 study (Study 
20120215) in patients aged 1 to <18 years.  
Descriptive statistics were performed to support PK similarity between the observed PK metrics of 
interest (Css) in the target population (paediatric with high-risk), and pooled PK data from ancillary 
studies in adults (R/R ALL, NL, MRD, R/R ALL in Japanese) or paediatric (R/R ALL, R/R ALL in 
Japanese). One Population PK analysis using all available PK data and two ER analysis (efficacy/safety) 
using only PK data from the pivotal study were performed. 
The bioanalytical assay for determination of blinatumomab in serum is considered validated and 
considered suitable. The same assay was used across the ancillary clinical studies (adult and pediatric 
populations).  The standard NCA and the population methodology are acceptable for PK data analyses. 
One concern was raised with regards to the dosing regimen used in this study which should have been 
guided by a PopPK/PD analysis according to the PIP. Data provided showed that selected dose 
15µg/m2/day was based on preliminary PK data (and efficacy/ safety data) from study MT103-206. 
Overall the PK data from this study are not well presented. 
In study MT103-205 During cIV infusion of 15µg/m2/day blinatumomab to pediatric subjects (n=34), 
the mean (SD) serum blinatumomab concentration at steady state was 533 (392) pg/mL with CV of 
73.6%. Median (min-max) was 498 pg/mL (58.5-2090 pg/mL). Geometric mean Css was 411 pg/mL.  
Interestingly, it could be observed that between cycles, Css at the same dosing regimen increase by 2-
fold in children from 2 to 17 years, however since only one cycle is expected for subjects with high risk 
first relapsed, such behavior will be difficult to observe. Overall, when PK data are split by age 
subgroup, it could be observed that the geometric mean CL is 2-fold higher in children aged 7-17 years 
compared to children ≤ 2 years (1.35 vs 0.662 L/h), therefore the applicant BSA based dose appears 
reasonable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/241758/2021  
Page 64/162 
 
 
 
A concern was raised with regards to a novel study (20130265) performed in R/R ALL Japanese adult 
and paediatric subject, which was used in addition to other studies to assess the PK similarity between 
populations. In Study 20130265 the PK data between the adult and the paediatric population are not 
similar at two levels, within the study (2-fold higher exposure in adult vs pediatric) and between 
studies (adult and paediatric from other studies). Fortunately, by providing more detailed PK data, Css 
in Japanese children (aged 7-17 years) were 1.5 fold lower than Css in children from Study MT103-
205, 361 vs 533 pg/mL, respectively. The value of 533 pg/mL probably rely on pooled Css across age 
cohorts, whereas the reported one 686 pg/mL rely on subjects aged 7-17 years from study MT103-
205. However the applicant states that age have not a significant effect on blinatumomab CL and this 
is not fully agreed based on the available PPK model since BSA is part as the final PPK model (BSA, 
age, weight are expected to be correlated, and the table which provide the covariate effect testing on 
PK is missing). In Japanese adult patient Css was 1.5 fold higher than Css in adult patients. Overall the 
applicant noted these differences but considered that PK was generally similar between population 
given the high CV% observed in adults 88% and in the paediatrics 76%. Moreover, the applicant state 
that race was not found as a significant covariate in the PPK analysis. However it should be noted that 
the entire PK dataset consisted of 760 subjects from which Asian accounted for 59 subjects (7.7% of 
the entire dataset), from which Japanese (35 subjects) accounted for 4.6% of the entire dataset (less 
than at least the 10% needed to detect any significant covariate). Therefore data have been provided 
with the exclusion of the Japanese population, nevertheless, the applicant argued that PK similarity 
between Japanese paediatric and adult subject, and between Japanese and other race subject can be 
claimed given the high IIV. 
In addition, a concern was raised on the claimed PK similarity between paediatric subject from Study 
20120215 and those from Study MT103-205 or adult subjects. Based on geometric mean of Css (which 
is considered as the best metric to consider instead of arithmetic mean, Css is related to CL and CL 
follow a lognormal distribution), in Study 20120215, Css is not similar between children aged 2-6 
years and 7-17 years, this can be claimed only based on median Css. It should be noted that probably 
one (or several) outlier(s) in the group of children aged 7-17 years is probably responsible of the high 
CV Geo mean of 92.9%. Based on Geometric mean of CL the same trend remains. The same 
comments can be made with PK data from Study MT103-205 (for both Css and CL) suggesting an 
effect of age on blinatumomab PK. However according to the applicant, based on the PopPK model age 
was not found to have an effect on blinatumomab PK (this is expected since BSA is already introduce 
in the PK model, and both are known to be correlated). 
When geometric mean Css (or CL) are compared between age cohorts from Study 20120215 and 
Study MT103-205, for: 
-<2 years, Css are not comparable 
- 2-6 years old children, Css (CV%) were 642 (42.6%) vs 303 (120.8%) pg/mL, then approximately a 
2.1-fold greater Css 
- 7-17 years old, Css were 904 (92.9%) vs 567 (70.2%) pg/mL, then approximately a 1.6-fold greater 
Css 
- 1-17 years (pooled), Css were 718 (66.3%) vs 411 (93%) pg/mL, then approximately a 1.7-fold 
greater Css 
Even if the comparison is performed based on the arithmetic mean Css with pooled Css across age, Css 
were 921 vs 533 pg/mL, then approximately a 1.7-fold greater Css in subjects from Study 20120215. 
Therefore Css in both paediatric populations from Study 20120215 and Study MT103-206 are not 
comparable.

Now compared to adults PK data the applicant claimed that PK in the pediatric population fell within 
the range of corresponding values for the combined group of all adult subjects taking into 
consideration the large IIV of CV% of 144%. However this conclusion rely on pooled Css across all the 
pediatric cohort and studies by considering a mean Css, and such comparison is not considered reliable 
as raw PK data clearly show that PK data from Studies 20120215 and MT103-205 are not comparable 
and cannot be pooled. 
Raw data suggest that mean Css in adults subjects is similar to the pediatric population from study 
MT103-205, however such conclusion cannot be claimed with mean Css from Study 20120215. Overall 
the applicant rely on the large IIV observed (CV of 144%) to claim the comparability between Css 
across the populations. However one can argue that such high CV can be reduced if instead of a BSA 
based fixed-dose, an adapted dose based on another metrics or maybe based on the disease status 
would not have led to these unexpected PK results in this pediatric population compared to others 
populations. 
Overall, therefore statement on PK similarity is not endorsed and it has been deleted from the SmPC. 
Pediatric subject from Study 20120215 have a 1.7 fold increased Css compared to pediatric subjects 
from study 20120215 and consequently compared to adults R/R ALL. 
A concern was raised with regards to the developed PopPK model and a new one has been requested 
with only PK data from the pediatric population to address the dosing regimen issue.  
The requested simulation (based on an updated model) shows that predicted Css in children weighting 
more than 45 kg with the two dosing regimens (15 µg/m2 or 28 µg) are similar. Upon request, another 
RUV model (combined) have been investigated by the applicant with the initial PPK model (all the data 
except those from children) to try to correct the under-prediction of the central tendency, however no 
improvement of the pcVPC was observed. pcVPC split by study with the update PPK model were 
provided. Generally the central tendency (and variability) is well captured across the different studies 
except reasonable misspecifications for all the pediatric studies. The associated simulation exercise 
(based on an updated) was provided and shows that predicted Css in children weighting more than 45 
kg with the two dosing regimens (15 µg/m2 or 28 µg) are similar. The requested PPK model was 
performed by the applicant without investigation of an IOV term. The evaluation of baseline blast was 
performed but remain uninformative since only 52% of pediatric subjects had this measure. pcVPC 
split by studies remain similar (with the same reasonable misspecifications) to those with the updated 
PPK model. This may be explained by the structure of the PK model which have not been improved and 
was set to be similar to that of adults even if, in general it is not expected a different structural PK 
model between adults and paediatrics subjects. This probably explain the inflated observed RUV, to 
this end the IOV term should have been of particular interest, nevertheless the issue will not be 
pursued, as the simulation exercise performed similarly. In conclusion, the new simulation perform 
similarly to that which use pooled PK data.  
In addition, several concerns were raised with regards to the unclear effect of blast percentage at 
baseline (or after subsequent cycles) on blinatumomab clearance. Indeed results from NCA and PopPK 
analysis appear conflicting. Also, several studies from which PK of blinatumomab have been evaluated 
at subsequent cycle clearly show that as long as the number of cycles increase (and the number of 
percent blast is expected to decrease), Css increase suggesting that there is an effect of blast 
percentage on blinatumomab clearance. This behavior is observed in Study MT103-205 between Cycle 
1 and Cycle 2, with geometric mean Css of 411 pg/mL and 684 pg/mL respectively, in Study 
20130265, in both adult and pediatric subjects from Cycle 1 to Cycle 3, with mean Css of 948 to 1420 
pg/mL in adults and 361 to 780 pg/mL in pediatric subjects. However, no such blast effect on Css was 
evident as demonstrated by the applicant at the individual level (data not shown). Nevertheless, it 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/241758/2021  
Page 66/162 
 
 
 
should be noted that the applicant acknowledges that the % blast at baseline have an effect on Css 
(and thus on CL). However, this effect is not clinically relevant. 
ER analyses (efficacy/safety) were performed using estimated blinatumomab Css provided by the NCA 
approach and even if 54 patients were enrolled, only 40 Css from 40 patients were considered. Overall 
according to the applicant Css was not related to any of the efficacy or safety endpoints.  
The exploratory analyses shown above suggested that the distribution of baseline covariates are 
similar across the exposure Css quartiles. Maintenance of EFS and OS at study cut-off as well as 
occurrence of CRS, neurological events, and infections is similarly distributed. 
Given the small number of subjects and a single dose cohort, univariate analysis found no significant 
association between exposure and time to EFS and suggested that the blinatumomab Css achieved in 
study 20120215 using the 15 µg/m2/day dose regimen (with maximum daily dose not exceeding 28 
µg/day) was sufficient to achieve EFS. 
Univariate analysis also demonstrated no significant association between exposure and time to EFS or 
OS and the covariates tested in the univariate analyses, thus no further multivariate analyses were 
conducted.    
In conclusion, the association between variation of Css with selected efficacy and safety responses was 
empirically explored for the dosing regimen evaluated in study 20120215. Blinatumomab Css achieved 
with the dose tested in study 20120215 was sufficient to prolong EFS and OS compared to HC3, 
demonstrating no significant association between exposure and duration of EFS or duration of OS. No 
associations were found between blinatumomab Css and the occurrence of neurologic events, CRS, or 
infections or the time to neurologic events. Overall, the exposure-response analyses support the 
dosing regimen of 15 µg/m2/day (maximum dose not to exceed 28 µg/day) in pediatric patients with 
high-risk first relapsed B-precursor ALL. 
Regarding dose rational, comparable exposures of blinatumomab in subject’s ≥ 45 kg are expected 
when receiving either a fixed dose or BSA-based dose in terms of median. However in terms of 
geometric mean pediatric subject have already a 1.6-fold higher exposure (735 vs 461 pg/mL). 
Nevertheless, since the safety profile remain similar between adult and pediatric subjects, the 
proposed dosing regimen can be considered acceptable. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Exposure to blinatumomab in paediatric patients aged 1-<18 years with high-risk first relapsed Ph- B-
cell precursor ALL, receiving the commercial formulation following a BSA based dose regimen, has been 
shown to be 1.7-fold higher than both adult and paediatric with R/R ALL. Nevertheless, since the safety 
profile  remain  similar  between  adult  and  paediatric  subjects,  the  proposed  dosing  regimen  can  be 
considered acceptable. 
No new PD data was included in this submission. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No dedicated dose response study was carried out. The rationale for the clinical dose selection for 
consolidation therapy of blinatumomab for the treatment of high-risk first relapsed ALL after induction 
therapy was based mainly on the totality of PK, efficacy, and safety information.  The recommended 
dose regimen for this population is 15 µg/m2/day for subjects < 45 kg and 28 µg/day for subjects ≥

45 kg administered by continuous IV infusion. Refer to dedicated discussion in above clinical PK 
section. 
2.4.2.  Main study 
Title of Study 
Study 20120215 is an ongoing phase 3, randomized, open-label, controlled, multicentre study 
investigating the efficacy and safety profile of blinatumomab versus intensive SOC late consolidation 
chemotherapy in paediatric subjects. 
Methods 
Figure 28: Study design and treatment schedule (study 20120215) 
The design of Study 20120215 was agreed to with PDCO as part of the PIP (EMEA-000574-PIP02-12-
M03). 
The study consisted of a 3-week screening period, a 4-week treatment period followed by a 1-week 
safety follow-up period, a 12-month short-term efficacy follow-up, and a long-term follow-up that 
continued until the last subject on study was either followed for 36 months after receiving allogeneic 
HSCT or until death, whichever occurred first. After reaching the primary endpoint, subjects were to be 
followed in the long-term follow-up period. 
After induction therapy and 2 blocks of high-risk consolidation chemotherapy (HC), paediatric subjects 
with high-risk first relapse B-cell ALL were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either blinatumomab arm or a 
third block of standard-of-care chemotherapy (HC3 arm):  
-  Blinatumomab was administered as continuous IV infusion at a constant daily flow rate of 15 
µg/m2/day over 4 weeks (maximum daily dose was not to exceed 28 µg/day). Subjects 
randomized to HC3 arm received 1 cycle (1 week) of HC3.  
-  High-risk consolidation 3 chemotherapy was administered per the IntReALL protocol. 
Most subjects who were in or achieved second CR (M1 bone marrow) after completing consolidation 
therapy in either the blinatumomab or HC3 arm were to undergo allogeneic HSCT.

Treatments 
Subjects randomized to blinatumomab arm received 1 cycle (4 weeks) of blinatumomab. 
Blinatumomab was administered as continuous IV infusion at a constant daily flow rate of 15 
μg/m2/day over 4 weeks (maximum daily dose was not to exceed 28 μg/day).

Objectives and endpoints 
Table 34: Objectives and Endpoints (pivotal study 20120215) 
Complete remission (CR) was defined as M1 bone marrow (representative bone marrow aspirate or 
biopsy with <5% blasts, satisfactory cellularity, and regenerating hematopoiesis), peripheral blood 
without blasts, and absence of extramedullary leukemic involvement. M2 was defined as 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/241758/2021  
Page 73/162 
 
 
 
 
representative bone marrow aspirate or biopsy with ≥ 5% and < 25% blasts. M3 bone marrow was 
defined as representative bone marrow aspirate or biopsy with ≥ 25% blasts. 
Sample size 
For EFS, an enrolment target of approximately 202 subjects and the observation of 94 events would 
give approximately 84% power using a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05. The calculation was based on a 
non-cured hazard ratio (HR) of 0.63, a control true cure rate of 40%, a control true median EFS of 7 
months among non-cured patients, a true treatment cure rate of 56.2%, and a true treatment median 
EFS of 11.1 months among non-cured subjects. 
Two interim analyses were planned to assess benefit when approximately 50% and 75% of the total 
number of EFS events were observed; Or when approximately 50 true cure were calculated with the 
use of a Lan-DeMets alpha spending function (O-Brien and Fleming, 1979; Lan and DeMets, 1983). 
Testing of the secondary endpoints was planned to be descriptive at the interim analyses. 
As noted above, the first interim analysis was planned when approximately 50% of the total EFS 
events had occurred. The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) reviewed the results of the first interim 
analysis and concluded that the threshold for declaring efficacy was met for the primary endpoint. 
Subsequently, the DMC recommended to stop enrolment for benefit in the blinatumomab arm, and 
only continue with treatment and long-term follow-up for those already enrolled on the study per the 
protocol-specified follow-up period. The MAH accepted the DMC’s recommendation. The interim results 
met the criteria for this analysis to become the primary analysis. 
Randomisation 
Upon confirmation of eligibility, study centre stuff assigned a randomization number to the subject 
through the Integrated Voice Response System (IVRS). Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive either blinatumomab or HC3. Randomization was stratified by age, bone marrow status, and 
MRD status. Subjects should have commenced protocol-required therapy within 3 days of 
randomization. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study has an open label design. 
Statistical methods 
No formal hypothesis testing was performed.  
Blinatumomab would demonstrate a reduction in the risk of events (relapse or M2 marrow after having 
achieved a CR, failure to achieve a CR at the end of treatment, secondary malignancy, or death due to 
any cause) in this paediatric, high-risk, first relapse B-cell ALL population. It was anticipated that the 
risk reduction of events would be 37% in noncured subjects and a cure rate would increase from 40% 
to 56.2% (cure was defined as a subject having no EFS event after 36 months on study). 
A sensitivity analysis assigned the planned study day rather than the actual study day to EFS events 
(other than deaths) to address potential evaluation-time bias resulting from the different treatment 
lengths between study arms. To address the potential bias of differing cycle lengths between study 
arms, EFS event times were grouped into discrete times as follows: as with the primary analysis, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/241758/2021  
Page 74/162 
 
 
 
subjects who failed to achieve or maintain a CR before the disease assessment at the end of the first 
randomized treatment cycle (or before the assessment on day 15 for those subjects on the 
blinatumomab arm) were assigned an EFS duration of 1 day. An additional sensitivity analysis included 
allogeneic HSCT as a time-dependent covariate in a stratified Cox regression model and tested the null 
hypothesis using the treatment effect from that Cox model. 
Testing of the secondary endpoints was planned to be descriptive at the interim analysis. Intent-to-
treat analysis of efficacy included all subjects who underwent randomization (the Full Analysis Set); 
analysis of safety included all subjects who received either blinatumomab or HC3 (the Safety Analysis 
Set). Time-to-event endpoints were summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method, and treatment arms 
were compared using two-sided stratified log-rank tests. Treatment effects were expressed as a HR 
with a 95% CI, estimated using a stratified Cox regression model. Percentages with exact 95% CIs 
summarized response endpoints. The cumulative incidence of relapse was analysed using an extension 
of the Cox regression model, whereby deaths that occurred before relapse and unrelated to an 
otherwise undocumented relapse were treated as a competing risk (Fine and Gray, 1999). Subject 
incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events were also summarized. 
The percentage of subjects in each treatment arm with an MRD response (ie, MRD level < 104) was 
summarized with an exact binomial 95% CI. In addition, a 2-sided Cochran Mantel-Haenszel test, 
which adjusted for the stratification factors at randomization, described the difference in MRD response 
between treatment arms. If a baseline MRD marker was found for a subject, then that subject was part 
of the MRD Evaluable Set. Safety analyses were descriptive in nature, and included summaries of 
blinatumomab administration and exposure, adverse events, concomitant medications, laboratory 
measurement, vital signs, and antibody testing.  
An external independent DMC assessed safety approximately every 6 months provided that the 
enrolment rate was adequate. 
Results 
Results from the primary analysis of efficacy and safety are provided below. The final analysis for the 
CSR of Study 20120215 is expected to be available by 2023.  
Participant flow 
A total of 121 subjects were screened, of which 108 eligible subjects were randomized (54 subjects to 
the HC3 arm and 54 subjects to the blinatumomab arm) and comprise the Full Analysis Set.

Protocol deviations 
As of the data cut-off date, 52 subjects (48.1%) had important protocol deviations (IPDs). The DMC 
reviewed all the IPDs and determined that they did not present a safety risk for the subjects. The most 
common IPD was “missing data”, most of which occurred when bone marrow samples were not sent 
for central review during treatment or follow up. However, bone marrow specimens at diagnosis were 
sent for central review for all the study subjects. Therefore, the diagnosis of B-cell ALL in all study 
subjects have been confirmed by central review. Moreover, all missing central lab bone marrows had 
local morphology reading response. For subjects without central review of the bone marrow during 
treatment or follow up, bone marrow MRD was assessed by either polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
and/or flow cytometry. The second and third most common IPD were “off-schedule procedures” (table 
60) and “other deviations”, respectively.

Non-fulfilment with inclusion/exclusion criteria 
- The IPD “Clinically relevant CNS pathology requiring treatment (eg, unstable epilepsy). Evidence of 
current CNS (CNS 2, CNS 3) involvement by ALL” concerned 3 subjects (2 in the blinatumomab arm, 1 
in the HC3 arm). These subjects were eligible because CNS was successfully treated prior to 
enrolment, as allowed per study protocol. Although the screening CSF test within the study defined 
window was not done in these 3 subjects, the likelihood of them having CNS disease prior to cycle 1 
day 1 treatment start was low given that all of them had received intense chemotherapy including 
induction and two blocks of consolidation chemotherapy with MRD negative (< 10-4) bone marrow at 
screening, and 2 of the 3 subjects had no history of CNS disease. In addition, the distribution of this 
IPD was balanced between both treatment arms. 
- The IPD “Subjects with M1, M2 marrow at the time of randomization” occurred in 1 subject in both 
treatment arms. It was based on local bone marrow assessment in both subjects. Central marrow 
results in both subjects, although showing M1 marrow, was not available to the sites at the time of 
enrolment.   
- The IPD “Subjects with Philadelphia chromosome negative (Ph-) high-risk (HR) first relapse B-
precursor ALL (as defined by I-BFM SG/IntReALL criteria) (after second consolidation after induction 
according to IntReALL treatment guidelines)”   occurred in 1 subjects in both arms. It was reported 
due to subjects not receiving study defined induction or consolidation chemotherapy prior to 
enrollment.  The variation in chemotherapy was deemed necessary and compatible with local 
treatment guidelines per treating physicians. 
- The IPD “Peripheral neutrophil < 500/µL prior to start of treatment” concerned 1 patient for whom 
transplantation was scheduled with conditioning in 1 month and the BM was normal and regenerative.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint  Event-Free Survival (EFS) 
As of the data cu-toff date, the median follow-up time for EFS was 22.4 months. The subject incidence 
of EFS events was 57.4% in the HC3 arm and 33.3% in the blinatumomab arm. Event-free survival 
was statistically significantly improved in the blinatumomab arm when compared with HC3 arm (p < 
0.001 by the stratified log-rank test). 
The EFS hazard ratio from a stratified Cox proportional hazard model was 0.36 (95% CI: 0.19, 0.66), 
indicating a 64% risk reduction in the blinatumomab arm. Results obtained with unstratified HR were 
similar (HR= 0.39; 95% CI: [0.22; 0.70]). 
The median EFS was 7.4 months (95% CI: 4.5 to 12.7 months) in the HC3 arm and was not reached in 
the blinatumomab arm (95% CI: 12.5 months to not estimable [NE]). A Kaplan-Meier plot comparing 
EFS between the treatment arms is presented in figure below. The 36-month Kaplan-Meier estimate 
was 26.9% (95% CI: 13.2% to 42.8%) in the HC3 arm and 55.7% (95% CI: 37.8% to 70.4%) in the 
blinatumomab arm.  
Figure 30: Kaplan-Meier for Event-free Survival (Full Analysis Set) 
Similar results were obtained in the ‘clean’ snapshot, dated 16 December 2019 with data filtered up to 
analysis trigger date 17 July 2019. 
Additional sensitivity analyses were done for EFS to evaluate potential bias of differing cycle lengths 
between the study arms; the results of these analyses (in ‘as-in’ and ‘clean’ analysis) were similar to 
the results from the primary analysis (data not shown).  
To evaluate the consistency of EFS in subgroups, subgroup analyses were performed to test treatment-
by-subgroup interactions in a Cox regression analysis (an interaction term with a p-value < 0.10 was 
suggestive of an inconsistent treatment effect). Subgroup analyses for EFS included the following 
subgroups: age based on stratification, bone marrow/MRD status based on stratification, 6 strata 
formed by the combination of the stratification factors, age for disclosure, sex, and time from first 
diagnosis to relapse.

Subgroup analyses for EFS using ‘as-is’ and ‘clean’ snapshots were provided. The results were similar 
between the 2 snapshots. No notable treatment-by-subgroup effects were observed for any subgroups, 
showing that the blinatumomab treatment effect was consistent across the subgroups. The estimated 
hazard ratios within the treatment groups were all < 1 and directionally favoured blinatumomab 
treatment. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints - Overall Survival (OS) 
As of the data cut-off date, the median follow-up time for OS was 19.5 months. The subject incidence 
of death was 29.6% in the HC3 arm and 14.8% in the blinatumomab arm; the nominal p-value from 
the stratified log-rank test was 0.047. 
The OS hazard ratio from a stratified Cox proportional hazard model was 0.43 (95% CI: 0.18 to 1.01). 
The median OS was not reached in either arm. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival at 36 months 
was 55.8 months (95% CI: 36.9 to 71.0 months) in the HC3 arm and 81.1 months (95% CI: 65.5 to 
90.2 months) in the blinatumomab arm.

Figure 31: Kaplan-Meier for Overall Survival (Full Analysis Set) 
In the Full Analysis Set, 13 subjects were randomized and treated with HC3, and then received 
blinatumomab treatment. After treatment with investigational product indeed, additional therapies, 
including blinatumomab, were allowed at the discretion of the treating investigators.  Thirteen subjects 
in the HC3 arm received blinatumomab following HC3 or following further lines of therapies including 
allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Twelve of these subjects received 
blinatumomab due to relapsed/refractory disease (M2 or M3 bone marrow [≥ 5% and <25% blasts or 
≥ 25% blasts, respectively]), and 1 of the subjects received blinatumomab due to minimal residual 
disease (MRD)-positive status (M1 bone marrow [< 5% blasts] with MRD ≥ 104). Seven of the 13 
subjects received blinatumomab as a third line of treatment (treatment for initially diagnosed disease 
was considered as first line and HC3 +/- allogeneic HSCT as second line).  Six of the 13 subjects 
received blinatumomab as fourth or fifth line of treatment.  A sensitivity analysis was performed to 
estimate the treatment effect adjusted for the HC3 subjects dropping into the blinatumomab arm 
(Branson and Whitehead, 2002). This analysis produced a hazard ratio that was similar to that in the 
primary analysis (0.35 [95% CI: 0.12, 1.01; p = 0.052]). 
Subgroup analysis for OS included the following subgroups: age based on stratification, marrow/MRD 
status based on stratification, 6 strata formed by the combination of the stratification factors, age for 
disclosure, sex, and time from first diagnosis to relapse. Only limited conclusions can be drawn from 
the OS subgroup analysis because only 24 deaths were observed overall.

Of the 54 subjects in the blinatumomab arm who were included in the Safety Analysis Set, 48 (88.9%) 
had a postbaseline antibody result; none of the subjects tested positive for binding or neutralizing anti-
blinatumomab antibodies. Therefore, analyses evaluating the effect of anti-blinatumomab antibodies

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study design and method 
The pivotal study 20120215 is an ongoing phase 3, randomized, open-label, controlled, multicentre 
study investigating the efficacy and safety profile of blinatumomab versus intensive SOC late 
consolidation chemotherapy in paediatric subjects. 
The randomized study design allows a comparison of results obtained versus SOC. However, a bias in 
investigator’s assessment cannot be ruled out considering the open label design. Randomization was 
stratified by age, bone marrow status, and MRD status.   
The inclusion/exclusion criteria of pivotal study 20120215 were designed to select a high-risk 
population, as per IntReALL study, OR with positive MRD after induction and 2 consolidation cycles. 
Considering the treatment schedule in the study, and blinatumomab as part of consolidation therapy, 
the indication has been adjusted accordingly indicating that blinatumomab is considered to be part of 
the consolidation therapy (see final adopted indication).  
Cycle length was different, with a 4 weeks cycle in blinatumomab arm and 3 weeks cycle in HC3 as per 
IntReALL protocol. This point is addressed in sensitivity analyses  
Eligible paediatric subjects for this study should have Phi - B-precursor ALL in first relapse. High-risk 
(HR) population was defined as per IntReALL study, or with positive MRD after induction and 2 
consolidation cycles. HR status per IntReALL protocol is defined per very early relapse (< 18 months 
from initial diagnosis), early isolated bone marrow relapse (> 18 months after primary diagnosis and < 
6 months from completion of front-line therapy). The HR status in IntReALL protocol didn’t include 
MRD level. It was specified that MRD was assessed at screening and was taken into account in 
stratification at the end of induction therapy. Considering the data provided, MRD status was known for 
two thirds of the subjects, including 20% who were MRD positive. Subgroups analysis showed, 
regardless of the MRD level, a trend in hazard ratio in favour of the blinatumomab arm which is 
acceptable. Exclusion criteria follow the known safety profile for blinatumomab.  
As also highlighted in Locatelli et al. publication, this classification does not consider rearrangements, 
which is a non-negligible limitation in this HR graduation.  
IntReALL 2010 protocol allowed the implementation of study 20120125 in the continuity of InTReALL 
study, as follows: “At the end of the HR consolidation, an investigational window has been 
implemented to allow further studies in this patient cohort.” 
This study included a long-term follow-up up to 36 months until the last subject on study after HSCT or 
died.

The primary objective was to compare EFS after blinatumomab versus SOC. EFS was calculated from 
randomization to relapse, M2 after having achieved CR, no CR at the end of treatment, SPM or death, 
whichever occurred first. This is acceptable per current guidelines for oncology treatments. 
Threshold greater than 5% blasts in the bone marrow (M1) follows ESMO guidelines (2016) for the 
definition of haematological relapse. 
The planned sample size was 202 subjects to allow 84% power using a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05. 
There was no formal hypothesis.  
At time of first interim analysis (when 50% of the total EFS events had occurred), efficacy endpoint 
was met and enrolment was stopped for benefit in the blinatumomab arm. This interim analysis is 
adequately considered as primary analysis.  
The intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of efficacy included all subjects who underwent randomization and is 
referred to as the Full Analysis Set (FAS). 
Blinatumomab was expected to demonstrate a reduction in the risk of events (relapse or M2 marrow 
after having achieved a CR, failure to achieve a CR at the end of treatment, secondary malignancy, or 
death due to any cause), with a risk reduction of 37% in non-cured patients and a cure rate increase 
from 40% to 56.2% (cure was defined as a subject having no EFS event after 36 months on study). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study conduct 
The study initially planned to enrol 202 subjects but recruitment in the study was prematurely stopped 
on 17 July 2019, based on DMC recommendation at time of first interim analysis. Thus, study data are 
limited to the primary analysis, in a sample size limited to 108 enrolled patients (54 per study arm).  
The study remains ongoing and the final analysis is planned by 2023. The final analysis CSR remains 
expected as soon as available (letter of recommendation).  
At time of the data cut-off date, 75 subjects (69.4%) remained on study (32 in HC3 arm and 43 in 
blinatumomab arm) and 33 subjects (30.6%) discontinued the study (22 in HC3 arm and 11 in 
blinatumomab arm). Study discontinuation was mainly due to death (24 deaths, including 16 in HC3 
arm and 8 in blinatumomab arm) and consent withdrawal (5 in HC3 arm and 2 in blinatumomab arm). 
Among the 108 enrolled subjects, 105 received the study treatment (51 in the HC3 arm and 54 in the 
blinatumomab arm) and most of patients completed investigational treatment (99; 91.7%: 49 subjects 
in the HC3 arm and 50 subjects in the blinatumomab arm). 
However, 52 subjects (48.1%) had important protocol deviations. A quarter of subjects had missing 
data, driven by bone marrow samples not sent for central review during follow up; this would not 
impact the diagnosis of B-cell ALL nor EFS assessment. The Applicant classified the 22 subjects with 
missing data due to non-sending of bone marrow samples for central review during follow-up into 3 
categories/group (Group 1: Subsequent M1 BM per central lab review after missing a central BM 
assessment; Group 2: Subsequent M1 BM per local lab review after missing a central lab BM 
assessment; Group 3: Did not have a complete of set of central or local BM assessments collected at 
all the protocol-specified timepoints) and performed a risk analysis. The proposed categorization is 
acceptable. Few disease progressions were observed in Groups 1 and 2. Only the Group 3 subjects 
could potentially have a meaningfully impact on EFS result. Among these six subjects, four were from 
the blinatumomab arm while 2 were from the HC3 arm. Based on the data provided, all patients in 
blinatumomab arm had no event (n=3) or death of any cause (n=2), without impact of BM assessment 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/241758/2021  
Page 103/162 
 
 
 
on the timing of assessment of these events. The conclusion is that these deviations had no major 
impact on efficacy results. 
The second most common IPD were “off-schedule procedures”. 14 subjects had assessment not 
performed in due time. The development of CNS disease because following anticipated screening 
lumbar puncture (LP) is unlikely. Indeed, all subjects had already received intrathecal chemotherapy at 
the time of screening LP. 11 of the 14 subjects (except for 3 subjects [1 in the blinatumomab arm and 
2 in the HC3 arm]) had no CNS disease at the time of relapse and thus had very low risk for further 
CNS relapse soon after induction and 2 blocks of consolidation chemotherapy. Detailed data have been 
provided in Table 60 (see AR above). Also “off-schedule procedures” protocol deviations are considered 
not to have major impact on efficacy results. 
Concerning the non-fulfilment with inclusion or exclusion criteria, the Applicant provided details on 
these major deviations (see above). These deviations would not have impacted study results. 
Baseline characteristics 
Subjects’ baselines were globally consistent between both treatment arms. The proportion of male 
patients was higher in blinatumomab arm (55.6% vs 40.7%) and median age was 1 year older (6 vs 5 
years in HC3 arm). However, age groups were similar in both arms, with around 70% of patients aged 
1 to 9 years. There was no patient below 1 year of age, which is reflected in the targeted indication. 
A lower proportion of subjects had genetic abnormality in blinatumomab arm (37.0 vs 46.3%), driven 
by hyperdiploidy (6 patients each). MLL rearranged was only observed in HC3 arm (4 patients, 7.4%). 
Extramedullar disease at diagnosis and at relapse were comparable between both arms, observed in 
14 patients in HC3 arm (25.9%) and 10 patients (18.5%) in blinatumomab arm, mainly in CNS in both 
arms. Globally, all but 3 patients were M1 bone marrow. Baseline MRD was only available in about 2 
thirds of subjects, with positive MRD in 21.3% and 20.4% globally (with PCR and flow cytometry 
detection respectively). 
Baseline blood cell counts were similar between both arms. Median time from first diagnosis to first 
relapse was similar between both arms, with 20.95 and 22.34 months in HC3 and blinatumomab arms 
respectively. Very early relapse < 18 months, as per IntReALL definition previously discussed, was 
observed in 22(40.7%) and 19 (35.2%) of patients in HC3 and blinatumomab arms respectively. 
Randomization was stratified by age, bone marrow status, and MRD status. Both arms were balanced 
regarding these characteristics. 
Primary endpoint – EFS 
Event was defined as relapse or M2 marrow after having achieved a CR, failure to achieve a CR at the 
end of treatment, secondary malignancy, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. At time of 
data cut-off, median EFS was 7.4 months (95% CI: 4.5 to 12.7 months) in the HC3 arm and was not 
reached in the blinatumomab arm (95% CI: 12.5 months to not estimable [NE]). Median FU time was 
22.4 months. EFS event incidence was 57.4% in the HC3 arm and 33.3% in the blinatumomab arm, 
with a statistically significant difference between both arms, in both stratified and unstratified analysis. 
Similar results were obtained in data analysis dated 16 December 2019 including only data until 17 
July 2019 as it was the predefined date. It seems that MRD threshold applied in subgroups analysis 
was 103, while 104 was used in baseline characteristic. This discrepancy is justified by the fact that 
MRD level at the end of induction was assessed in country local labs including those using 103 as the 
threshold due to available MRD assay sensitivity in these labs.  MRD level at baseline in Study 
20120215 was assessed in central labs that utilized assays with sensitivity sufficient to allow 
application of 104 as the MRD negativity cut-off.

Page 104/162 
 
 
 
Results in subgroups analysis confirmed trends observed in EFS, favourable with blinatumomab 
treatment. 
The 36-month KM estimate (95% CI) was 26.9% (13.2% to 42.8%) in HC3 arm and 55.7% (37.8% to 
70.4%) in blinatumomab arm. Thus the cure rate increase, expected to raise from 40% to 56.2%, was 
met. However, the cure rate in the comparative arm was clearly lower than expected. In this regards 
the provided expected cure rate in the comparative HC3 arm was based on 2013 unpublished study 
data in the same population. Since then, front-line treatments have improved, suggesting that cure 
rate expected in second line currently would be lower. Thus, the applicant considers that cure rate was 
overestimated, without impact on study results nor interpretation. The applicant did not discuss if this 
could anyway reflect a suboptimal course of this comparative arm. However, considering cure rate 
obtained in blinatumomab arm (independently of the difference when compared to the comparative 
arm), the applicant’s conclusion is endorsed; the overestimation of the cure rate do not appear to have 
had a major impact on study data interpretation.  
Secondary endpoints 
Median OS were not reached at time of interim data cut off, with a median FU time of 19.5 months. 
Death incidence was 29.6% in the HC3 arm and 14.8% in the blinatumomab arm, with a significant 
difference in both stratified and unstratified analysis. Results in median OS remain expected in the final 
analysis as soon as available. KM estimates raised significant differences between both arms, favorable 
for blinatumomab treatment. 
13 out of the 54 patients in HC3 arm received blinatumomab treatment subsequently to HC3 
treatment, following R/R disease (n=12) or MRD (n=1). This did not impact the analysis.  
Subgroups analysis is endorsed, with limited conclusion considering small sample size in these 
subgroups. 
MRD response was defined as MRD level < 104, with 2 methods of assessment (quantitative PCR and 
flow cytometry). Only patients with baseline MRD were assessed for MRD response. At time of primary 
cut-off date (17 July 2019), with PCR method, 54.2% (26/48) in HC3 arm and 89.8% of patients 
(44/49) in blinatumomab arm had achieved an MRD response. The difference between both arms was 
significant, favorable for blinatumomab treatment.  Trends in MRD response were similar when 
measured by flow cytometry, with a higher number of assessable patients and a higher number of 
MRD response detected.  
Sensitivity analysis with per protocol analysis was provided, in order to assess potential impact of 
protocol deviations on study results. Despite sample size sharply reduced (23 and 27 MRD evaluable 
patients in HC3 and blinatumomab arms respectively with PCR), results remained significantly higher 
in blinatumomab arm, with 89.8% (77.8; 96.6) of MRD response at the end of C1 D29. Further 
sensitivity analysis confirmed the favorable trend observed with blinatumomab in MRD response. 
Globally, at time of primary cut-off date, a similar proportion of subjects went to alloHSCT between 
both arms: 85.2% in HC3 arm and 88.9% in blinatumomab arm. In blinatumomab arm, all of these 
patients received alloHSCT before relapse. Median time to transplant from randomization was similar 
between both arms (1.7 and 1.9 month in HC3 and blinatumomab arms respectively). Donor type and 
conditioning were quite balanced between both arms. The main stem cell source was bone marrow in 
both arms; however, a higher proportion of subjects received stem cell from peripheral blood in 
blinatumomab arm (41.7%) vs HC3 arm (23.7%). 
The 100 days mortality estimate was provided in patients with alloHSCT prior relapse (n=38 in HC3 
arm, n=48 in blinatumomab arm), and estimated from the date of alloHSCT: it was lower in 
blinatumomab arm (4.2% (1.1; 15.6) vs 5.6% (1.4; 20.5)), but not significantly different considering

crossing CI. At the cut-off date (17 jul 2019), 41/48 (85.4%) of patients remained alive in 
blinatumomab arm, and 26/38 (68.4%) in HC3 arm. The median time to death was reached in neither 
arm. 
The cumulative relapse, in the full analysis set (54 subjects per arm), was 53.7% of patients in HC3 
arm and 24.1% in blinatumomab arm presented with LAL relapse. One additional patient in HC3 arm 
died due to disease progression. The discrepancy between OS death and cumulative relapse events are 
justified considering that the overall survival (OS) analysis reports all deaths observed on study, 
regardless of cause or if there was relapse prior to death.  Therefore, all 24 deaths observed on study 
are reported as an event in the OS analysis.  The cumulative relapse analysis reports the time to first 
event where the events include relapse or death due to disease progression.  For a subject that died 
on study but experienced a relapse prior to death, the relapse was reported as the event, not the 
death.  Therefore, the cumulative relapse analysis only reports deaths as events if they occurred 
without a prior relapse and the cause of death was due to disease progression. 
Data on patients who received subsequent CAR-T cell therapy have been provided. Among the two 
subjects who received CAR-T cell therapy in the blinatumomab arm, one had no EFS event at last 
follow up in January 2021. The second subject died of ALL due to disease progression. Among the 
three subjects who had CAR-T in the HC3 arm, one each died of disease progression, cardiorespiratory 
arrest and myocardial infarction. The two last subjects had received blinatumomab after HC3 
treatment. These data allow an interesting but limited analysis. Indeed, given the sample size, it is not 
possible to conclude on a lower response to CAR-T cells in one treatment arm or another. 
Considering the cumulative incidence estimate of relapse or death due to disease progression, the 
difference remained significant between both arms up to 36 months from randomization, in favor of 
blinatumomab treatment.  
None of the 48 patients with a post baseline antibody result presented with anti-blinatumomab 
antibodies. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The pivotal study 20120215 provided results in 108 patients (54 per study arm). Median EFS in 
blinatumomab arm was not reached (vs 7.4 months (95% CI: 4.5; 12.7) in HC3 arm) and EFS event 
incidence was statistically different, in favour of blinatumomab arm (57.4% in the HC3 arm and 33.3% 
in the blinatumomab arm). The 36-month KM estimate EFS was 26.9% (13.2% to 42.8%) in HC3 arm 
and 55.7% (37.8% to 70.4%) in blinatumomab arm. The expected cure rate increase was met but the 
cure rate in the comparative arm was lower than expected. 
Median OS were not reached at time of interim data cut off. Death incidence was 29.6% in the HC3 
arm and 14.8% in the blinatumomab arm, with a significant difference in both stratified and 
unstratified analysis.  
With PCR method, the difference in MRD response was statistically significant: 54.2% in HC3 arm vs 
89.8% in blinatumomab arm. Sensitivity analysis with per protocol, despite very limited sample size, 
confirmed the favorable trend observed with blinatumomab in MRD response. 
A similar proportion of subjects went to alloHSCT between both arms: 85.2% in HC3 arm and 88.9% in 
blinatumomab arm. Median time to transplant was similar between both arms (1.7 and 1.9 month in 
HC3 and blinatumomab arms respectively).  
The 100 days mortality estimate, in patients with alloHSCT prior relapse (n=38 in HC3 arm, n=48 in 
blinatumomab arm), was lower in blinatumomab arm (4.2% (1.1; 15.6) vs 5.6% (1.4; 20.5)), but not

significantly different considering crossing CI. At the cut off date (17 jul 2019), 41/48 (85.4%) of 
patients remained alive in blinatumomab arm, and 26/38 (68.4%) in HC3 arm. The median time to 
death was reached in neither arm. 
None of the 48 patients with a post baseline antibody result presented with anti-blinatumomab 
antibodies. 
In conclusion, considering the data provided the clinical difference remained significant between both 
arms, in favour of blinatumomab treatment. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Safety data are provided from the pivotal Study 20120215. 
Additionally, this variation application includes supporting pooled safety data from the 3 completed 
single-arm, open-label, multicenter blinatumomab studies in paediatric subjects with 
relapsed/refractory ALL (second or greater relapsed, relapsed after HSCT, and refractory to previous 
treatments) as a reference population for assessing the safety of blinatumomab in paediatric subjects 
with high-risk first relapsed ALL: 
-  Study MT103-205, an open-label, single-arm, dose-finding, phase 1b/2 study in 93 paediatric 
subjects in second or later bone marrow relapse, in any marrow relapse after allogeneic HSCT, or 
refractory to other treatments 
-  Study 20130320, an open-label, single-arm, expanded access study in 110 paediatric subjects with 
relapsed/refractory B-cell precursor ALL 
-  Study 20130265, an open label, multicenter, phase 1b/2 study in 40 adult and 26 paediatric 
Japanese subjects with relapsed/refractory ALL. Data from the 26 paediatric subjects in this study 
are included in the proposed variation application.

Table 49: Summary of Clinical Studies Contributing to the Safety of Blinatumomab for the 
Treatment Pediatric Subjects with ALL 
For Study 20120215, the safety data cut-off date was based on the primary analysis data cut-off date 
of 17 July 2019. For the 3 completed studies (Studies MT103-205, 20130320, and 20130265), the 
safety data cut-off dates were based on the final analysis data cut-off dates for the studies. 
Method 
Adverse events are defined as events that started between the start of the first infusion of 
investigational product (blinatumomab or HC3) and 30 days after the end of the last infusion during 
the study. 
The safety assessment of paediatric subjects from Study 20120215 who received at least 1 infusion of 
blinatumomab (N = 54) is based on the primary analysis of safety data with a data cut-off date of 17 
July 2019. During the treatment period, visits were performed on days 1, 15, and day 29 or end of 
treatment. A safety follow-up visit was required within 7 days before allogeneic hematopoietic stem 
cell transplantation (HSCT) or anti-cancer therapy for current malignancy not mandated by the 
protocol, whichever comes first. 
Subjects were followed during a short-term efficacy follow-up period of 12 months after allogeneic 
HSCT, and then were followed in a long-term follow-up period until the last subject on study either was 
followed for 36 months after allogeneic HSCT or died, whichever occurred first. 
For all studies summarized in the integrated safety analyses (ie, for the iSAP), the Safety Analysis Set 
was used to include all subjects who received any infusion of blinatumomab. Demographics, baseline

disease characteristics, and disposition are summarized based on the Full Analysis Set. Adverse 
events, exposure, and other safety assessments are summarized based on the Safety Analysis Set. 
Patient exposure 
The protocol-defined dose and regimen for each of the 4 studies that comprise the safety database are 
shown in the table below.

Of the 108 subjects randomized in study 20120125, 105 subjects (51 in the HC3 arm; 54 in the 
blinatumomab arm) received investigational product and are included in the Safety Analysis Set. In the 
HC3 arm, 3 subjects did not receive treatment. Of the 105 subjects that received treatment, 99 
subjects (91.7%) completed treatment (49 subjects [90.7%] in the HC3 arm; 50 subjects [92.6%] in 
the blinatumomab arm). 
As of the data cut-off, the mean (SD) duration of blinatumomab treatment was 26.5 (6.0) days, and 
the mean (SD) cumulative blinatumomab dose was 378.2 (110.1) μg/m2. 50 subjects (92.6%) 
completed the blinatumomab treatment cycle (ie, 90% of planned duration) and 4 subjects (7.4%) 
discontinued the treatment cycle.  
Dose modification in each arm are summarized in the table below.

Treatment-related Adverse Events 
For the primary analysis of Study 20120215, the rate of treatment-related adverse events was 
comparable (78.4% [40/51] in the HC3 arm; 83.3% [45/54] in the blinatumomab arm). 
In the HC3 arm, the related adverse events with a rate ≥ 10% were stomatitis (41.2%, 21/51), anemia 
(35.3%, 18/51), neutropenia (25.5%, 13/51), thrombocytopenia (21.6%,11/51), and febrile 
neutropenia (15.7%, 8/51), and platelet count decreased (13.7%, 7/51).  In the blinatumomab arm, 
the related adverse event with a rate ≥ 10% were pyrexia (55.6%, 30/54) and headache (18.5%, 
10/54). 
Related adverse events more than 10% higher in the HC3 arm than in the blinatumomab arm were 
anemia (35.3% for HC3; 3.7% for blinatumomab), stomatitis (41.2% for HC3; 1.9% for blinatumomab), 
platelet count decreased (13.7% for HC3; 0% for blinatumomab); neutropenia (25.5% for HC3; 1.9% 
for blinatumomab), and thrombocytopenia (21.6% for HC3; 1.9% for blinatumomab).  Related adverse 
events more than 10% higher in the blinatumomab arm than in the HC3 arm were pyrexia (55.6% for 
blinatumomab; 3.9% for HC3) and headache (18.5% for blinatumomab; 2.0% for HC3).   
Relapsed/Refractory ALL Population:  
Related adverse events that were more than 10% higher in the relapsed/refractory ALL population 
compared with the high-risk first relapsed ALL population include:  Blood and Lymphatic System 
Disorders (24.6%; 56/228 versus 3.7%; 2/54); Investigations (31.1%; 71/228 versus 16.7%; 9/54).  
By System Organ Class, no related adverse events were more than 10% higher in the high-risk first 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/241758/2021  
Page 122/162 
 
 
 
 
 
relapsed ALL population compared with the relapsed/refractory ALL population.  The following had 
comparable rates between relapsed/refractory and high-risk first relapsed ALL populations:  General 
Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (62.3%; 142/228 versus 59.3%; 32/54); Gastrointestinal 
Disorders, which was comparable between populations (21.5%; 49/228 versus 25.9%; 14/54); Nervous 
System Disorders (22.4%; 51/228 versus 29.6%; 16/54), and Immune System Disorders (20.6%; 
47/228 versus13.0%; 7/54).   
In the relapsed/refractory pediatric ALL population, related adverse events with a rate ≥ 10% were 
pyrexia (61.8%; 141/228), cytokine release syndrome (19.3%; 44/228), anemia (11.8%; 27/228), 
headache (12.3%; 28/228), and ALT increased (10.5%; 24/228).  In the blinatumomab high-risk first 
relapsed population, adverse events with a rate ≥ 10% were pyrexia (55.6%, 30/54) and headache 
(18.5%, 10/54). 
Cytokine release syndrome (19.3% for relapsed/refractory; 3.7% for high-risk first relapsed) was the 
only related adverse event that was more than 10% higher in the relapsed/refractory ALL population 
compared with the high-risk first relapsed ALL population, which may be attributed to a higher 
percentage of baseline bone marrow blasts in the relapsed/refractory ALL population compared with 
the high-risk first relapsed ALL population.  No related adverse events were more than 10% higher in 
the high-risk first relapsed ALL population compared with the relapsed/refractory ALL population.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
An overview of deaths across the blinatumomab pediatric ALL studies is  presented below. Across the 
blinatumomab pediatric ALL studies (N = 282), a total of 96 deaths were reported.  A total of 25 subjects 
(8.9%) had treatment emergent fatal adverse events.

Other serious TEAEs 
For the primary analysis of Study 20120215, a summary of serious adverse events is presented in the 
table below.   
Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported for 27.5% (14/51) of subjects in the HC3 arm 
and 16.7% (9/54) of subjects in the blinatumomab arm. In the HC3 arm, the most frequently reported 
treatment-related serious adverse event was febrile neutropenia (11.8% [6/51]). In the blinatumomab 
arm, the most frequently reported treatment-related serious adverse events were neurological symptom 
and seizure (each 3.7% [2/54]). 
In  the  HC3  arm,  the  most  frequently  reported  treatment-related  serious  adverse  events  by  System 
Organ Class were in Blood and lymphatic system disorders (17.6% [9/51]).

Events of Interest  
Key  risks  for  the  blinatumomab  paediatric  program  include  neurologic  events,  cytokine  release 
syndrome, and medication errors. The full list of EOIs is provided below. 
Table 64: Event of Interest, Search Strategy, and Search Scope 
In  study  20120215,  no  subjects  had  events  of  tumor  lysis  syndrome,  leukoencephalopathy,  or 
immunogenicity. 
•  Neurologic Adverse Events 
The  analysis  of  adverse  events  suggestive  of  neurologic  and  psychiatric  events  was  based  on  a 
comprehensive search of sponsor-defined (AMQ) high-level arm terms from Nervous Systems Disorders 
and Psychiatric Disorders System Organ Classes. 
Neurologic events were reported at a more than a 10% higher rate in the blinatumomab treatment arm 
(48.1%, n = 26) compared with the HC3 treatment arm (29.4%, n = 15).

Table 65: Neurologic AEs –TEAE of Interest by Preferred Term (Safety Analysis Set –) 
The median time to onset of neurologic events was earlier in blinatumomab arm (2.5 days; range:  1 to 
51 days) compared with the HC3 arm (8.0 days; range:  1 to 46 days).  In the blinatumomab arm, a 
total of 52 neurologic events were reported, of which 45 events (86.5%) resolved.  In the HC3 arm, a 
total  of  25 neurologic  events  were  reported,  of  which  23 events  (92.0%)  resolved.    For  the  resolved 
events,  the  median  time  to  event  resolution  was  2.5 days  (range:  1, 46 days)  for  subjects  in  the 
blinatumomab arm and 6.0 days (range:  1, 256 days) for subjects in the HC3 arm.    
One subject (2.0%) in the HC3 arm and  3  subjects (5.6%) in the blinatumomab arm had neurologic 
events that were grade ≥ 3 in severity.  In the HC3 arm, the grade ≥ 3 event was confusional state. In 
the blinatumomab arm, the grade ≥ 3 events were nervous system disorder, seizure, and neuralgia (each 
in 1 subject [1.9%]).  The time to onset for grade ≥ 3 neurologic events was 3.0 days for the subject in 
the HC3 arm and 2.0 days (range:  2 to 54 days) for subjects in the blinatumomab arm.  In the HC3 
arm, the 1 event resolved as of the cutoff date.  In the blinatumomab arm, 2 events resolved, and 1 
event  were  unresolved  as  of  the  cutoff  date.    For  the  resolved  grade  ≥  3  events,  the  time  to  event 
resolution  was  3 days  for  the  1  subject  in  the  HC3  arm  and  1 and  2  days  for  the  2  subjects  in  the 
blinatumomab arm.    
One subject (2.0%) in the HC3 arm and 5 subjects (9.3%) in the blinatumomab arm had neurological 
events that were deemed serious.  By preferred term, the serious adverse events were headache (2.0%, 
n = 1) in the HC3 arm and neurological symptom and seizure (3.7%, n = 2 for each), and nervous system 
disorder (1.9%, n = 1) in the blinatumomab arm.  All events resolved.  The rates of neurologic events 
that led to treatment interruption and discontinuation were 2.0% and 0%, respectively, in the HC3 arm 
and 5.6% and 3.7%, respectively, in the blinatumomab arm. 
•  Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) 
One subject (2.0%) in the HC3 arm and 2 subjects (3.7%) in the blinatumomab arm had CRS. The time 
to onset was 30 days for 1 subject in the HC3 arm and 1 and 2 days for 2 subjects in the blinatumomab 
arm. All 3 events resolved; the time to resolution was 3.0 days for 1 subject in the HC3 arm and 3 and 
7 days for 2 subjects in the blinatumomab arm. No events were deemed grade ≥ 3 or serious adverse 
events. 
•  Medication errors 
Assessment report

No subjects (0.0%) in the HC3 arm and 1 subject (1.9%) in  the blinatumomab arm had a medication 
error.  The event was grade 2 accidental overdose, deemed serious by the investigator, and resolved. 
No adverse events were reported in association with the accidental overdose.   
• 
Infections 
Events of interest are defined as any adverse events in the Infections and Infestations System Organ 
Class.  For the assessment of opportunistic infections, a definition of opportunistic infection was applied 
that  was  consistent  with  infections  that  occur  with  increased  frequency  or  severity  among 
immunocompromised patients such as HSCT recipients, which was performed across the blinatumomab 
pediatric ALL studies. 
In the System Organ Class of Infections and Infestations, events were reported at a more than a 10% 
higher rate in the blinatumomab treatment arm (42.6%, n = 23) compared with the HC3 treatment arm 
(31.4%, n = 16).  The most frequently reported (≥ 3 subjects) infections by preferred term were rhinitis 
(9.8%, n = 5 for HC3; 1.9%, n = 1 for blinatumomab), nasopharyngitis (2%, n = 1 for HC3; 5.6%, n = 3 
for blinatumomab), and paronychia (0% for HC3; 5.6%, n = 3 for blinatumomab).  The median time to 
onset of infections was earlier for subjects in the HC3 arm (10.5 days, range:  1 to 36 days) compared 
with subjects in the blinatumomab arm (34.0 days, range:  14 to 58 days).   In the HC3 arm, all 27 
infections resolved.  In the blinatumomab arm, 42 of 45 (93.3%) infections resolved.   For the resolved 
events, the median time to event resolution was earlier for subjects in the HC3 arm (8.5 days, range:  
2 to 48 days) than for subjects in the blinatumomab arm (23.0 days, range:  1 to 274 days). 
The rate of grade ≥ 3 infections was more than 5% higher for the blinatumomab arm (18.5%, n = 10) 
compared with the HC3 arm (9.8%, n = 5).  By preferred term, no grade ≥ 3 infections were reported in 
> 1 subject in either treatment arm.  The median time to onset for grade ≥ 3 infections was earlier for 
subjects in the HC3 arm (13.0 days, range:  4 to 31 days) compared with subjects in the blinatumomab 
arm (52.5 days, range:  14 to 61 days).  In the HC3 arm, all 7 grade ≥ 3 infections resolved.  In the 
blinatumomab arm, 12 of 14 (85.7%) of grade ≥ 3 infections resolved. For the resolved grade ≥ 3 events, 
the median time to event resolution was 12.0 days (range:  5 to 33 days) for subjects in the HC3 arm 
and 16.5 days (range:  4 to 72 days) for subjects in the blinatumomab arm.  The higher incidence of 
grade ≥ 3 infections in the blinatumomab arm could be explained by the adverse event reporting period 
ending  30  days  after  last  dose  of  investigational  product.  This  period  ended  later  for  blinatumomab 
patients due to the duration of administration, often overlapping with subsequent anti-cancer therapy.   
A post hoc analysis showed that the time from last dose of investigational product to allogeneic HSCT 
was 2 times earlier for subjects who received blinatumomab (mean 0.9 months) compared with subjects 
who  received  HC3  (mean  1.95  months).    Therefore,  any  infections  associated  with  transplant 
conditioning treatment were more likely reported in the blinatumomab arm since adverse event were 
reported up to 30 days following last dose of investigational treatment.  An additional post hoc analysis 
showed that the rates of infections were similar (31.4% for HC3; 29.4% for blinatumomab) when the 
reporting  time  was  on  or  before  the  safety  follow-up  visit  (ie,  before  the  start  of  the  allogeneic 
conditioning).    The  rates  of  grade  ≥  3  infections  were  also  similar  (9.8%  for  HC3;  13.0%  for 
blinatumomab) when reported on or before the safety follow-up visit. Specifically, 7 of  10 grade ≥  3 
infections  in  the  blinatumomab  arm  and  0  of  5  grade  ≥  3  infections  in  the  HC3  arm  occurred  after 
receiving allogeneic HSCT preparative regimens (data on file).   
Four subjects (7.8%) in the HC3 arm and 3 subjects (5.6%) in the blinatumomab arm had infections that 
were deemed serious.  By preferred term, no serious adverse event was reported in > 1 subject and all 
serious adverse events resolved. No infections led to treatment interruption and discontinuation in either 
treatment arm.  No infections were fatal. 
•  Elevated Liver Enzymes  
Assessment report

Identification of elevated liver enzyme events was based on the narrow search strategy for the MedDRA 
SMQ Liver-related Investigations, Signs and Symptoms.   
In addition to the narrow search, all potential cases of drug-induced liver injury were identified initially 
by applying the Hy’s law laboratory criteria (ALT or AST ≥ 3.0 x upper limit of normal [ULN]; total bilirubin 
≥ 2.0 x ULN; alkaline phosphatase < 2.0 x ULN) to liver parameters reported to have occurred at any 
time during treatment.  
Elevated liver enzyme events were reported at a more than a 10% higher rate in the HC3 treatment arm 
(29.4%, n = 15)  compared with the blinatumomab treatment arm (13.0%, n=7). The most  frequently 
reported (> 2 subjects) elevated liver enzymes events were increased ALT (13.7%, n=7 for HC3; 7.4%, 
n = 4  for  blinatumomab),  increased  AST  (9.8%,  n=5  for  HC3;  3.7%,  n=2  for  blinatumomab), 
for  HC3;  1.9%,  n=1 
hypertransaminasemia  (7.8%,  n=4 
gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) (3.9%, n = 2 for HC3; 1.9%, n=1 for blinatumomab).   
for  blinatumomab),  and 
increased 
Grade  ≥  3  elevated  liver  enzyme  events  were  reported  at  a  more  than  10%  higher  rate  in  the  HC3 
treatment arm (17.6%, n = 9) compared with the blinatumomab treatment arm (5.6%, n = 3).  The most 
frequently reported (> 2 subjects) elevated liver enzyme events that were grade ≥ 3 in severity were 
increased ALT (9.8%, n = 5 for HC3; 1.9%, n = 1 for blinatumomab), hypertransaminasemia (5.9%, n = 
3  for  HC3;  0%  for  blinatumomab),  and  increased  GGT  (3.9%,  n  =  2  for  HC3;  1.9%,  n = 1  for 
blinatumomab).  No events were fatal.   
One subject (2.0%) in the HC3 arm had elevated liver enzyme event of hypertransaminasemia that was 
deemed serious; this event resolved. No subjects in either arm had elevated liver enzyme events that 
led to treatment interruption or discontinuation. 
No  subjects  met  the  laboratory  criteria  of  Hy’s  law  before  treatment  of  protocol-specified  therapy.  
Overall, 7.8% of subjects (4/51) in the HC3 arm and 1.9% of subjects (1/52) in the blinatumomab arm 
met the biochemical criteria of Hy’s law at any time during treatment.   
For  the  1  subject  in  the  blinatumomab  arm,  none  of  the  laboratory  values  were  elevated  during 
treatment.  The laboratory value criteria were met after completion of treatment with blinatumomab, 
between 45 days to 6 months after allogeneic HSCT.  Therefore, this subject did not meet the definitive 
criteria of the Hy’s law during treatment.  
For  the  4  subjects  in  the  HC3  arm,  not  all  the  laboratory  criteria  were  met  during  treatment.    The 
laboratory value criteria were met on day 29 for 1 subject and during post-HSCT period to the end of 
study for 3 subjects.  All 4 subjects had ≥ 1 elevated Hy’s law laboratory parameter at baseline.  Elevation 
of laboratory parameters were episodic, did not show a discernable pattern of occurrence and did not 
appear to lead to progressive liver injury.  Therefore, these subjects did not meet the definitive criteria 
for Hy’s law.

Embolic and Thrombotic Events 
Adverse events suggestive of venous thrombosis and thromboembolic events were based on the narrow 
search strategy for the MedDRA SMQ Embolic and Thrombotic Events.  
No subjects in the HC3 arm and 4 subjects (7.4%) in the blinatumomab arm had embolic and thrombotic 
events.  The adverse events were device occlusion, disseminated intravascular coagulation, jugular vein 
thrombosis, and veno-occlusive disease  (1.9%, n = 1  for each).  Two  subjects  had grade ≥  3 events.  
Grade ≥ 3 events include veno-occlusive disease (1.9%, n = 1) and jugular vein thrombosis (1.9%, n = 
1).  No subject had embolic and thrombotic events that were deemed serious, fatal, or led to treatment 
interruption or discontinuation. 
• 
Infusion Reactions 
Potential infusion-related adverse events were identified by applying an AMQ narrow search strategy of 
preferred terms likely associated with infusion reactions.  Since an infusion reaction could represent a 
broad spectrum of signs and symptoms occurring within a close proximity of an infusion, many preferred 
terms may represent adverse events that are not an infusion related reaction.  A preferred term was 
considered to be an infusion reaction if it occurred within 48 hours of the infusion. 
Infusion reactions were reported at a more than a 10% higher rate for the blinatumomab treatment arm 
(68.5%, n = 37) compared with the HC3 treatment arm (7.8%, n = 4).  This is most likely explained by 
the dosing regimens of the 2 treatments, as blinatumomab is infused for a much longer duration than

HC3.  Blinatumomab is administered as a continuous intravenous (IV) infusion over 28 days, while the 
chemotherapy components of HC3 are administered by IV on over 7 days.    
The most frequently reported infusions reactions reported in ≥ 5% in either treatment arm were pyrexia 
(0% in HC3; 63.0%, n = 34 in blinatumomab) and hypotension (0% in HC3; 7.4%, n = 4 blinatumomab).  
No subjects in the HC3 arm and 2 subjects (3.7%) in the blinatumomab arm had an infusion reaction 
that was grade ≥ 3 in severity.  The adverse events were hypotension and pyrexia.  No infusion reactions 
were fatal.  
No subjects in the HC3 arm and 1  subject (1.9%) in the blinatumomab arm had an infusion reaction 
(pyrexia)  that  was  deemed  serious;  this  event  resolved.  No  infusion  reactions  led  to  treatment 
interruption or discontinuation in either treatment arm. 
•  Neutropenia and Febrile Neutropenia 
Neutropenia events are based on the sponsor-defined narrow search strategy. 
Neutropenia events were reported at a more than 10% higher rate for the HC3 treatment arm (54.9%, n 
= 28) compared with the blinatumomab treatment arm (22.2%, n = 12). The neutropenia events were 
neutropenia (31.4%, n = 16 for HC3; 9.3%, n = 5 for blinatumomab), febrile neutropenia (25.5%, n = 13 
for HC3; 5.6%, n = 3 for blinatumomab), and decreased neutrophil count (3.9%, n = 2 for HC3; 9.3%, n 
= 5 for blinatumomab).   
The rate of grade ≥ 3 neutropenia events was more than 10% higher in the HC3 arm (52.9%, n = 27) 
compared with the blinatumomab arm (20.4%, n = 11). The grade ≥ 3 events were neutropenia (27.5%, 
n = 14 for HC3; 9.3%, n = 5 for blinatumomab), febrile neutropenia (25.5%, n = 13 for HC3; 3.7%, n = 2 
for  blinatumomab]),  and  decreased  neutrophil  count  (3.9%,  n  =  2  for  HC3;  7.4%,  n  =  4  for 
blinatumomab).  No neutropenia events in either treatment arm were fatal. 
Twelve subjects (23.5%) in the HC3 arm and no subjects in the blinatumomab arm had  neutropenia 
events that were deemed serious.  The serious adverse events reported for subjects who received HC3 
were  febrile  neutropenia  (17.6%,  n  =  9)  and  neutropenia  (5.9%,  n  =  3).    All  events  resolved.    No 
neutropenia events in either treatment arm led to treatment interruption or discontinuation. 
•  Capillary Leak Syndrome (CLS) 
One subject (2.0%) in the HC3 arm and 0 subjects (0.0%) in the blinatumomab arm had capillary leak 
syndrome events of interest. The event was deemed as grade 4 in severity and serious, and it resolved.  
• 
Pancreatitis 
One subject (2.0%) in the HC3 arm and 0 subjects (0.0%) in the blinatumomab arm had pancreatitis. 
This  event  of  acute  pancreatitis  was  deemed  grade  3  and  serious  adverse  event  of  interest,  and  it 
resolved. 
•  Decreased Immunoglobulins 
Decreased immunoglobulin events were reported at similar rate in the HC3 treatment arm (11.8%, n = 
6)  compared  with  the  blinatumomab  arm  (16.7%,  n  =  9).  Decreased  immunoglobulin  events  were 
hypogammaglobulinemia  (3.9%,  n  =  2  for  HC3;  11.1%,  n  =  6  for  blinatumomab),  decreased  blood 
immunoglobulin G  (3.9%,  n  =  2  for  HC3;  1.9%,  n  =  1  for  blinatumomab),  decreased  globulins  (n  = 
0 subjects for HC3; 1.9%, n  = 1 for blinatumomab), decreased immunoglobulins (3.9%, n = 2 for HC3; 
1.9%, n = 1 for blinatumomab).   
The rates of grade ≥ 3 decreased immunoglobulin events were comparable between treatment arms:  
2.0%  in  the  HC3  arm;  1.9%  in  the  blinatumomab  arm.    The  adverse  events  were  decreased 
Assessment report

immunoglobulin for the subject in the HC3 arm and decreased blood immunoglobulin G for the subject 
in the blinatumomab arm.  No events were fatal in either treatment arm. 
One subject (1.9%) in the blinatumomab arm had an event of decreased blood immunoglobulin G that 
was  deemed  serious;  this  event  resolved.    No  decreased  immunoglobulin  events  led  to  treatment 
interruption or discontinuation. 
In summary, a review of decreased immunoglobulin events did not reveal any additional safety concerns 
for subjects who received blinatumomab 
Minimum Critical Toxicities 
Minimum  critical  toxicities  for  this  variation  application  include  bone  marrow  toxicity  (cytopenias), 
hepatotoxicity,  nephrotoxicity,  and  torsade  de  pointes/QT  prolongation,  cardiac  arrhythmias,  and 
convulsion. 
- 
 Bone  marrow  toxicity  was  assessed  using  the  MedDRA  SMQ  hematopoietic  cytopenias  narrow 
search;  
-  Hepatotoxicity was assessed using the MedDRA SMQ drug-related hepatic disorders narrow search. 
A review of potential hepatotoxicity was performed by Hy’s law criteria; 
-  Nephrotoxicity  was  assessed  by  reviewing  adverse  events  with  preferred  terms  reported  in  the 
MedDRA SMQ acute renal failure and Renal and Urinary Disorders System Organ Class; 
-  QT prolongation was assessed by review of adverse events using the MedDRA SMQs of torsade de 
pointes/QT prolongation, cardiac arrhythmias, and convulsion (narrow searches).

Table 67: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events of Interest by System Organ Class and 
Preferred Term in Descending Frequency Bone Marrow Toxicity (Hematopoietic Cytopenias) 
(Narrow) (Safety Analysis Set) 
•  Hepatotoxicity 
Hepatotoxicity (drug related hepatic disorders) was based on the narrow search strategy for the MedDRA 
SMQ Drug Related Hepatic Disorders - comprehensive search.   
In the primary analysis, subjects who received HC3 had a more than a 10% higher rate of hepatotoxicities 
than subjects who received blinatumomab (37.3% versus  16.7%, respectively). The following adverse 
events were ≥ 5% higher in the HC3 arm compared with the blinatumomab arm:  hypertransaminasaemia 
(7.8% versus 1.9%); ALT increased (13.7% versus 7.4%); AST increased (9.8% versus 3.7%).  No adverse 
events suggestive of hepatotoxicities were ≥ 5% higher in the blinatumomab arm compared with HC3 
arm.  The most frequently reported (≥ 5% of subjects) adverse event in the blinatumomab arm was ALT 
increased (7.4%, n = 4). In the HC3 arm, 3 subjects (5.9%) had hypertransaminasaemia that was grade 
≥ 3 in severity and for 1 subject (2.0%) the event was deemed serious.   
In summary, no new safety signal was identified from a review of these data.  In a pediatric population 
with  high-risk  first  relapse  ALL,  subjects  who  received  blinatumomab  are  not  at  a  higher  risk  of 
hepatotoxicities than subjects who received HC3. 
•  Nephrotoxicity 
Nephrotoxicity was evaluated using the Acute Renal Failure SMQ (narrow search). 
Subjects who received HC3 had a similar rate of nephrotoxicity compared with subjects who received 
blinatumomab (2.0% versus 1.9%, respectively).  The adverse event of oliguria was reported for 1 subject 
who received HC3 treatment and the event of acute kidney injury was reported for 1 subject who received 
blinatumomab.  Neither event was grade ≥ 3 in severity or deemed serious. 
In summary, no new safety signal was identified from a review of these data.  In the pediatric high-risk 
first  relapsed  ALL  population,  subjects  who  received  blinatumomab  are  not  at  a  higher  risk  of 
nephrotoxicity than subjects who received HC3.

•  Arrhythmia, Convulsions, and Torsade de Pointes/QT Prolongation 
The SMQs of torsade de pointes/QT prolongation, cardiac arrhythmias, convulsions (narrow search) were 
used to identify adverse events that could be secondary to QT prolongation.   
Subjects  who  received  HC3  had  a  similar  rate  of  cardiac  arrhythmias  compared  with  subjects  who 
received blinatumomab (7.8%, n = 4 versus 5.6%, n = 3, respectively).  In the HC3 arm, the adverse 
events were sinus tachycardia (3.9%, n = 2) and electrocardiogram QT prolongation (2.0%, n = 1).  In 
the blinatumomab arm, the adverse events were sinus bradycardia  (3.7%,  n =  2), extrasystoles and 
sinus arrhythmia (1.9%, n = 1 for each); there were no event of QT prolongation or torsade de pointes 
reported for blinatumomab.  None of these events were grade ≥ 3 in severity or deemed serious. 
Subjects  who  received  HC3  had  a  similar  rate  of  convulsions  compared  with  subjects  who  received 
blinatumomab (2.0%, n = 1 versus 3.7%, n = 2, respectively).  In the HC3 arm, the adverse event was 
petit mal epilepsy (2.0%, n = 1).  In the blinatumomab arm, the adverse event was seizure (3.7%, n = 
3.7%).  One event of seizure was grade ≥ 3 in severity and deemed serious.  
Only 1  subject (2.0%) who received HC3 had Torsade  de Pointes –  QT prolongation.  The event was 
electrocardiogram QT prolongation; The event was neither grade ≥ 3 in severity or deemed serious. 
In summary, no new safety signal was identified from a review of these data.  In the pediatric high-risk 
first relapsed ALL population, subjects who received blinatumomab are not at a higher risk of cardiac 
arrhythmias, convulsions, and torsade de pointes/QT prolongation than subjects who received HC3.

Baseline immunoglobulin (IgG) data were available for 41 subjects in the HC3 arm and 53 subjects in 
the blinatumomab arm.  The median baseline IgG value was 4.68 g/L for the HC3 arm and 4.58 g/L for 
the blinatumomab arm.  The median IgG value for cycle 1 day 29 was 5.04 g/L for the HC3 arm and 
3.00 g/L for the blinatumomab arm.  As only 3 subjects had nonmissing values for the safety follow-up 
visit, the sample size is too small to support any conclusions.    
No new safety signal for blinatumomab was identified from the review of these data.

Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
Cumulatively, from clinical studies, there was 1 case of pregnancy reported in the long-term follow-up 
phase of a clinical trial. The case  described a  female with MRD-positive ALL who became pregnant  6 
months  after  the  last  dose  of  blinatumomab  in  Study  MT103-203.  Approximately  5  months  into  the 
pregnancy, an ultrasound revealed normal results with no fetal abnormalities detected. The outcome of 
the pregnancy was a live birth at the gestational age of 37 weeks. The investigator reported that the 
infant did not have any complications, medical problems, or congenital anomalies. 
Cumulatively, from non-study sources, there were 2 cases of pregnancy reported. The first case 
described a male patient with a pregnant partner who was potentially exposed while changing the 
infusion bags. The birth outcome was unknown (lost to follow-up). The second case described an event 
of fetal death while a female patient was receiving blinatumomab. The case did not provide the 
patients age or obstetric history. The patient was diagnosed with B-ALL in July 2018. The patient was 
treated sequentially. However, the ALL was refractory to both. Subsequently, blinatumomab was 
started at 9 μg/day x 1 week, and the dose was escalated to 28 μg/day. On day 14 of blinatumomab 
treatment (approximately 26 weeks gestation), the patient had a “spontaneous birth of a life-less 
child.” No details were provided as to fetal monitoring prior to the birth, autopsy, or pathology of fetus.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted with blinatumomab.  Blinatumomab is a 
therapeutic protein and is not expected to affect cytochrome P450 enzyme activities and catabolism of 
other proteins.  Blinatumomab may induce transient cytokine elevations and the elevated cytokines, 
especially IL-6, may have suppressive effect on P450 enzymes.  Effect of cytokines on activities of 
P450 enzymes was evaluated via a physiologically based PK modelling and simulation approach, and 
results were provided in the original MAA submission (2015).  It was concluded that the blinatumomab 
mediated cytokine elevation has a low potential to affect exposure levels of other drugs and the effect 
is inconsequential. 
Post marketing experience 
From the International Birth Date of 03 December 2014 to 02 June 2020 (data lock point for PBRER/PSUR 
#9), an estimated 11 774 patients have been exposed to blinatumomab in the marketed setting (through 
commercialization  and  early  access  programs).    Of  these,  more  than  916  patients  were  children 
(< 18 years of age). 
As of 02 June 2020, Amgen received a total of 5870 serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs) cumulatively 
from  spontaneous  and  solicited  sources.  In  addition,  3,227 nonserious  ADRs  were  reported 
spontaneously.  These  events  are  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  blinatumomab  or 
representative of the underlying malignancy.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data in this extension of indication are provided from the pivotal study 20120215. The review 
also included pooled safety data from 3 completed single-arm, open-label, multicenter blinatumomab 
studies in paediatric subjects with relapsed/refractory ALL (second or greater relapsed, relapsed after 
HSCT, and refractory to previous treatments).  
Safety analysis set in study 20120215 includes 105 patients (51 in HC3 arm, 54 in blinatumomab arm). 
Subjects received 1 cycle of blinatumomab treatment (4 weeks, 15 µg/m2/day through continuous IV). 
50 patients completed study treatment in blinatumomab arm.  
A similar proportion of patients  had dose modifications in both arms (21.6% and  25.9% in HC3 and 
blinatumomab arms respectively). However, all modifications were dose change in HC3 arm, while all 
modifications included drug interruption in blinatumomab arm. The reason for drug change was driven 
by  protocol  requirement  in  HC3  arm  (7/11)  and  adverse  event  in  blinatumomab  arm  (6/7).  Drug 
interruption in blinatumomab arm was mainly due to adverse event (13.0%) and ‘other’ reason (11.1%).  
In study 20120215, patients received only 1 cycle of blinatumomab or HC3, according to the protocol. 
Despite differences in protocols, which planned up to 5 cycles in additional paediatric studies, median 
duration of exposure is similar between study 20120215 and pooled peadiatric studies, with a median of 
1 cycle. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics, as previously discussed in the efficacy section, were balanced 
between both arms in study 20120215. Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar 
between study 20120215 and pooled paediatric ALL studies. However, it should be noted that patients 
in study 20120215 were slightly younger (median age of 6.0 years, vs 8.0). In blinatumomab subjects 
in study 20120215, baseline platelets and ANC were higher and all patients had baseline BM lasts <5% 
when compared to pooled paediatric ALL studies, as expected according to study inclusion criteria.

Overview of safety profile 
In study 20120215, most of patients presented with AEs in both arms (96.1% and 100% in HC3 and 
blinatumomab arms respectively). The frequency of treatment related AEs (TRAE) was also similar 
(78.4% and 83.3%) respectively. However, a higher proportion of patients in HC3 arm presented with 
TRAE grade ≥3 (62.7% vs 46.7% in blinatumomab arm) and serious TRAE (25.7% vs 16.7% in 
blinatumomab arm). 
When compared to pooled paediatric safety studies, the frequency of grade ≥3 AEs (78.1% in pooled 
studies vs 57.4% in blinatumomab arm 20150215) and serious AEs (47.4% vs 24.1%) was higher in 
pooled paediatric study. Similarly, TRAE grade ≥3 (44.7% vs 16.7%) were more frequent in pooled 
paediatric studies. 
In study 20120215, the highest increase in blinatumomab arm was reported in the following SOCs: 
General disorders and administration site conditions (35.3% in HC3 arm vs 88.9% in blinatumomab 
arm), Nervous system disorders (23.5% vs 42.6%) and Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
(25.5% vs 42.6%). The highest increase in TEAEs reporting in HC3 arm concerned Blood and 
lymphatic system disorders SOC (74.5% vs 35.2%). 
Common TEAEs were defined as TEAEs observed in at least 10% of subjects in any of both study arms. 
In study 20120215, TAEs with at least 10% higher frequency in blinatumomab arm were pyrexia 
(81.5% versus 19.6%), nausea (40.7% for versus 17.6%), and headache (35.2% versus 17.6%), 
while a higher frequency for the following AEs was reported in HC3 arm: anaemia (45.1% vs 22.2%), 
neutropenia (31.4% vs 9.3%), thrombocytopenia (25.5% vs 7.4%), febrile neutropenia (25.5% vs 
5.6%) and stomatitis (54.9% vs 18.5%). These safety results are coherent with the known safety 
profile of both treatments. The safety profile of blinatumomab was similar to pooled RR ALL paediatric 
population (refer to table 13 is CSS), despite a higher frequency of nausea (40.7% for high-risk first 
relapsed; 22.8% for relapsed/refractory), stomatitis (18.5% for high-risk first relapsed; 7.5% for 
relapsed/refractory), and mucosal inflammation (16.7% for high-risk first relapsed; 2.6% for 
relapsed/refractory) in blinatumomab arm in study 20120215. The implication of previous 
consolidation cycles in the onset of these TEAEs, as well as HSCT conditioning, in this population 
cannot be ruled out.  
In study 20120215, grade ≥3 TEAEs were reported in 82.4% of patients in HC3 arm, and 57.4% in 
blinatumomab arm. A similar trend was observed in related grade ≥3 TEAEs (62.7% vs 16.7%). The 
safety profile in grade ≥3 TEAEs appeared to be more favourable in blinatumomab arm, with the 
following grade ≥3 TEAEs more frequent in HC3: anaemia (41.2% in HC3 arm vs 14.8% in 
blinatumomab arm), neutropenia (27.5% vs 9.3%), febrile neutropenia (25.5% vs 3.7%) and 
stomatitis (31.4% vs 5.6%). The safety profile for grade≥3 TEAEs of blinatumomab in study 20120215 
was similar to pooled RR ALL paediatric population (refer to table 15 is CSS), despite a higher 
frequency of mucosal inflammation (13.0% versus none). 
In study 20120215, the frequency of TRAEs was similar between both arms (78.4% in the HC3 arm; 
83.3% in the blinatumomab arm). The following TRAEs were more frequent in HC3 arm: anaemia 
(35.3% for HC3; 3.7% for blinatumomab), stomatitis (41.2% vs 1.9%), platelet count decreased 
(13.7% vs 0%), neutropenia (25.5% vs 1.9%), and thrombocytopenia (21.6% vs 1.9%). TRAEs of 
pyrexia (55.6% for blinatumomab; 3.9% for HC3) and headache (18.5% vs 2.0% for HC3) were more 
frequent in blinatumomab arm. 
No unexpected safety signal was raised comparing blinatumomab arm to pooled paediatric safety data. 
Of note, mucosal inflammation was no longer reported as TRAEs with blinatumomab. A decrease in 
TRAE of CSR was noted; applicant’s hypothesis that this could be related to lower blast count in study 
20120215 is acknowledged.

The applicant provided data on TEAEs occurred after 31 days after treatment stopped in study 
20120215. Among them, serious GVHD events were more frequently reported in blinatumomab arm: 
acute GVHD (none in HC3; 1 in blinatumomab arm), GVHD in gastrointestinal tract (1 each) and GVHD 
in skin (none in HC3; 1 in blinatumomab arm) . Delayed neutrophil/platelet engraftment were 
discucssed based on ANC ≤ 5 x109/L and Platelet Count ≤ 20 x 109/L at 45 days Post-transplant. Based 
on cases retrieved, no risk of delayed neutrophil/platelet engraftment was identified following 
blinatumomab treatment pre HSCT. Infections post HCT were reported in 67 patients gobally (n=36, 
75.0% of patients with HSCT in blinatumomab arm; n=31, 67.4% in HC3 arm). No significant 
difference in these infections between both arms was identified. Two cases of graft failure were 
reported, one in each arm. Based on case narratives provided, no unexpected safety finding was raised 
from these two cases. GvHD was only reported in blinatumomab arm, in 3 patients. Of note, two of 
them had received HSCT from match-sibling donor. The applicant considered that, based on 
blinatumomab half life, a causal relationship is poorly probable. However, considering the 3 cases 
described, and the absence of case in HC3 arm, this point remains of concern. Supportive data were 
provided, from a previous phase 2 study, without higher risk of GvHD identified. Based on data 
provided, a causal relationship or a higher potential risk between blinatumomab treatment and GvHD  
seems not being supported. However, the risk of GvHD should remain closely monitored in the routine 
pharmacovigilance. To be noted, the risk of Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation-related toxicity in 
children remains one of the important potential risks, described in the RMP. 
No fatal TEAE was reported in study 20120215. The frequency of serious TEAEs was lower in 
blinatumomab arm (24.1% vs 43.1%); a similar trend was observed among treatment related serious 
AEs (’16.7% vs 27.5%). No unexpected safety finding was retrieved among serious AEs. 
No unexpected trend in AEs leading to Treatment Interruptions and treatment discontinuation was 
observed in study 20120215.  
Prespecified AESIs were neurologic events, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), infections, elevated liver 
enzymes, infusion reactions, tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), capillary leak syndrome (CLS), medication 
errors, decreased immunoglobulins, embolic and thrombotic events (including disseminated 
intravascular coagulation [DIC]), leukoencephalopathy including progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML), neutropenia and febrile neutropenia, lymphopenia, immunogenicity, and 
pancreatitis. Additionally, the following minimum critical toxicities were reviewed: bone marrow toxicity 
(cytopenias), hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and torsade de pointes/QT prolongation, cardiac 
arrhythmias, and convulsion.  
No unexpected safety signal was raised from these AESIs and critical toxicities. 
No safety signal was raised from changes in haematology laboratory parameters, immunoglobulins nor 
from vital signs. Regarding clinical chemistry, a review of the events in the blinatumomab arm of 
potassium decrease from grade 0 to grade 3 or 4. The review identified 6 AEs with switch in laboratory 
values, including 3 without temporal relationship with blinatumomab and 3 with confonding 
concomitant treatments. Theree addiontal cases were retrieved from clinical AEs reported, including 2 
without temporal relationship with blinatumomab and 1 with confonding medical condition. Based on 
these data, and the absence of significant difference in incidence between both arms, no new safety 
signal was identified.  
Subgroup analysis 
The applicant provided a subgroup analysis with 3 age groups in study 20120215: 28 days to 23 
months; 2 to 11 years; and 12 to 18 years. Despite limited conclusion due to very small sample size, 
no difference in safety profile was identified across age groups in blinatumomab arm, nor when 
comparing each age group between blinatumomab and HC3 arms.

No significant difference in safety profile was evidenced between male and female patients in 
blinatumomab arm, nor when comparing each sex group between blinatumomab and HC3 arms. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
No  unexpected  safety  signal  was  raised  in  high-risk  first  relapse  paediatric  patients  treated  with

2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridge to the results of the user consultation performed for the initial MAA. The changes to 
the package leaflet are minimal and do not require user consultation with target patient groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
The purpose of this variation application is to include:  
BLINCYTO as monotherapy for the treatment of paediatric patients aged 1 year or older with high-risk 
first relapsed Philadelphia chromosome negative CD19 positive B-precursor ALL as part of the 
consolidation therapy. 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a rare aggressive cancer of the blood and bone marrow. The majority 
of ALL cases are B-lineage, Philadelphia-negative ALL. There are approximately 6,300 new cases 
diagnosed in the European Union (EU) each year (based on Forman et al, 2014). Of these, 
approximately half are children. B-cell precursor ALL is the most common subtype of ALL, accounting 
for approximately 80% to 85% of total cases of ALL in children (American Cancer Society, 2015 and 
2014). 
Among children with B-cell precursor ALL, more than 95% achieve a complete remission (CR) with 
front-line treatment, and 75% to 85% remain progression-free 5 years from initial diagnosis (Schrappe 
et al, 2013). However, approximately 15% to 20% of children with B-cell precursor ALL relapse after 
current front-line chemotherapy (Hunger et al, 2015). 
The International Study for Children and Adolescents with Relapsed ALL (IntReALL), formed in 2010, 
stratified this population into two distinct risk groups, standard risk and high risk, defined by 
established risk factors (IntReALL, 2017; Locatelli et al, 2012). Therefore, the high-risk first relapsed 
ALL patient population is defined as patients with very early relapse (< 18 months from initial 
diagnosis) at any anatomical site, early isolated bone marrow relapse (< 18 months after primary 
diagnosis and < 6 months from completion of front-line therapy), and/or MRD-positive disease. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Pediatric treatment regimens are more intense than those used in adults and include courses of 
combination chemotherapy, including central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis and treatment (eg, 
intrathecal chemotherapy with or without cranial radiation).  
Treatment of high-risk first relapsed ALL generally includes 3 phases, including CNS prophylaxis and 
treatment:  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/241758/2021  
Page 154/162 
 
 
 
- Induction: The goal of induction therapy is to reduce tumor burden. Induction regimens are typically 
based on corticosteroids, vincristine, and anthracyclines with or without L-asparaginase and/or 
cyclophosphamide, 6-mercaptopurine, and cytosine arabinoside. 
- Consolidation: The intent of post-induction consolidation is to eliminate potential leukemic cells that 
remain after induction therapy, thus permitting further eradication of residual disease. The 
combination of drugs and duration of therapy for consolidation regimens vary between studies and 
patient populations. 
- Allogeneic HSCT: Patients with poor outcome and high rates of subsequent relapse after conventional 
intensive chemotherapy have an indication for allogeneic HSCT. 
- CNS Prophylaxis and Treatment: CNS prophylaxis is typically given throughout the course of ALL 
therapy starting from induction and continuing through maintenance therapy.  
Current treatment options rely heavily on aggressive chemotherapy regimens that are generally 
cytotoxic and may be poorly tolerated. Toxicities associated with these treatments may adversely 
contribute to reduced effectiveness and increased treatment-related mortality of subsequent allogeneic 
HSCT. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This extension of indication is mainly based on Study 20120215, a phase 3, randomized, open-label, 
controlled, multicenter study investigating the efficacy and safety profile of blinatumomab as part of the 
consolidation therapy versus intensive standard late consolidation chemotherapy in pediatric high-risk 
first relapsed ALL subjects. The randomized study design allows a comparison of results obtained versus 
SOC. 
After induction therapy and 2 blocks of consolidation chemotherapy, patients were randomized (1:1) 
to:  
- blinatumomab arm: continuous IV infusion, 15 µg/m²/day over 4 weeks (and maximum daily dose of 
28 µg/day); 
- or a third block of standard-of-care (SOC) chemotherapy (HC3 arm), per the IntReALL protocol. 
Eligible paediatric subjects for this study should have Phi - B-precursor ALL in first relapse. High-risk 
(HR) population was defined as per IntReALL study, or with positive MRD after induction and 2 
consolidation cycles. HR status per IntReALL protocol is defined per very early relapse (< 18 months 
from initial diagnosis), early isolated bone marrow relapse (> 18 months after primary diagnosis and < 
6 months from completion of front-line therapy). 
This study included a long-term FU up to 36 months until the last subject on study after HSCT or died. 
The planned sample size was 202 subjects to allow 84% power using a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05. 
However, the recruitment in the study was prematurely stopped on 17 July 2019 for efficacy in 
blinatumomab arm, based on DMC recommendation at time of first interim analysis. Thus, study data 
are limited to primary analysis, in a sample size limited to 108 enrolled patients (54 per study arm). 
Most of patients completed investigational treatment (99; 91.7%: 49 subjects in the HC3 arm and 50 
subjects in the blinatumomab arm).

Page 155/162 
 
 
 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Median EFS in blinatumomab arm was not reached (vs 7.4 months (95% CI: 4.5; 12.7) in HC3 arm) 
and EFS event incidence was statistically different, in favour of blinatumomab arm (57.4% in the HC3 
arm and 33.3% in the blinatumomab arm). Results in subgroups analysis confirmed trends observed in 
EFS, favourable with blinatumomab treatment. The 36-month KM estimate EFS was 26.9% (13.2% to 
42.8%) in HC3 arm and 55.7% (37.8% to 70.4%) in blinatumomab arm.  
Median OS were not reached at time of interim data cut off. Death incidence was 29.6% in the HC3 
arm and 14.8% in the blinatumomab arm, with a significant difference in both stratified and 
unstratified analysis.  
With PCR method, the difference in MRD response was statistically significant: 54.2% in HC3 arm vs 
89.8% in blinatumomab arm. Trends in MRD response were similar when measured by flow cytometry. 
Sensitivity analysis with per protocol, despite very limited sample size, confirmed the favorable trend 
observed with blinatumomab in MRD response. 
The cumulative relapse, in the full analysis set (54 subjects per arm), was 53.7% of patients in HC3 
arm and 24.1% in blinatumomab arm presented with LAL relapse. Considering the cumulative 
incidence estimate of relapse or death due to DP, the difference remained significant between both 
arms up to 36 months from randomization, in favor of blinatumomab treatment.  
At the cutoff date (17 July 2019), 41/48 (85.4%) of patients remained alive in blinatumomab arm, and 
26/38 (68.4%) in HC3 arm. The median time to death was reached in neither arm. 
None of the 48 patients with a post baseline antibody result presented with anti-blinatumomab 
antibodies. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The randomized study design allows a comparison of results obtained versus SOC. However, the 
following limitations should be taken into account:  
-  A bias in investigator’s assessment cannot be ruled out considering the open label design; 
-  Recruitment in the study was prematurely stopped on  17 July 2019 for efficacy in blinatumomab 
arm, based on DMC recommendation. Thus, study data are limited to primary analysis, in a sample 
size limited to 108 enrolled patients (54 per study arm). The final analysis remains expected, planned 
by 2023;  
-  Results in median OS remain expected in the final analysis, to be completed by may 2023. 
The expected cure rate increase, in terms of 36-month KM EFS estimate, was met. However, the cure 
rate in the comparative arm was lower than expected. This point was further clarified: the expected 
cure rate in the comparative arm, based on 2013 unpublished study data, could have been 
overestimated, considering current improvements in first-line treatments. However, considering results 
raised in blinatumomab arm, this would not have impacted efficacy results, nor their interpretation.  
About one half of patients had important protocol deviations. However, these deviations had no major 
impact on the results assessment. Moreover, assessment not performed in due time for 14 subjects 
and non-fulfilment with inclusion/exclusion criteria for 8 patients (3 in HC3 arm, 5 in Blinatumomab 
arm) bear no impact on study results nor on the robustness of the study conduct.  
While high risk of relapse in patients with MRD is acknowledged, HR status per MRD level is not clearly 
described in IntReALL protocol, and not clearly specified in inclusion criteria. Nevertheless, MRD level 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/241758/2021  
Page 156/162 
 
 
 
was not part of HR status but was assessed at screening and considered as risk factor in stratification 
at the end of the induction therapy.  
Exposure to blinatumomab in pediatric patients aged 1-<18 years with high-risk first relapsed Ph- B-
cell precursor ALL, receiving the commercial formulation following a BSA based dose regimen, has 
been shown to be 1.7 fold higher than both adult and pediatric with R/R ALL.  
No evaluation of quality of life was provided. Considering the 4 weeks IV continuous treatment with 
blinatumomab, vs one week of HC3 course, this would have been helpful to complete the assessment. 
No increase in allo HSCT was obtained: 85.2% in HC3 arm and 88.9% in blinatumomab arm. Median 
time to transplant from randomization was similar between both arms (1.7 and 1.9 month in HC3 and 
blinatumomab arms respectively).  
No significant difference in 100-days mortality was observed: 4.2% (1.1; 15.6) in blinatumomab arm 
vs 5.6% (1.4; 20.5) in HC3 arm.  
Very few data have been provided on response to CAR-T cells after blinatumomab considering that this 
could have been of concern, but very preliminary exploratory analysis did not confirm this risk at this 
point in time. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Safety data in this extension of indication are provided from the pivotal study 20120215: ongoing 
phase 3, randomized, open-label, controlled, multicentre study investigating the efficacy and safety 
profile of blinatumomab versus intensive SOC late consolidation chemotherapy in paediatric subjects. 
The review also included pooled safety data from 3 completed single-arm, open-label, multicenter 
blinatumomab studies in paediatric subjects with relapsed/refractory ALL (second or greater relapsed, 
relapsed after HSCT, and refractory to previous treatments).  
Safety analysis set in study 20120215 includes 105 patients (51 in HC3 arm, 54 in blinatumomab arm). 
Subjects received 1 cycle of blinatumomab treatment (4 weeks, 15 µg/m²/day through continuous IV). 
50 patients completed study treatment in blinatumomab arm.  
Overview of safety profile 
In study 20120215, most of patients presented with AEs in both arms (96.1% and 100% in HC3 and 
blinatumomab arms respectively). The frequency of treatment related AEs (TRAE) was also similar 
(78.4% and 83.3%) respectively. However, a higher proportion of patients in HC3 arm presented with 
TRAE grade ≥3 (62.7% vs 46.7% in blinatumomab arm) and serious TRAE (25.7% vs 16.7% in 
blinatumomab arm). 
In study 20120215, TAEs in blinatumomab arm were driven by pyrexia (81.5% versus 19.6%), nausea 
(40.7% for versus 17.6%), and headache (35.2% versus 17.6%), while a higher frequency for the 
following AEs was reported in HC3 arm: anaemia (45.1% vs 22.2%), neutropenia (31.4% vs 9.3%), 
thrombocytopenia (25.5% vs 7.4%), febrile neutropenia (25.5% vs 5.6%) and stomatitis (54.9% vs 
18.5%).  
The safety profile in grade ≥3 TEAEs appeared to be more favourable in blinatumomab arm, with the 
following grade ≥3 TEAEs more frequent in HC3: anaemia (41.2% in HC3 arm vs 14.8% in 
blinatumomab arm), neutropenia (27.5% vs 9.3%), febrile neutropenia (25.5% vs 3.7%) and 
stomatitis (31.4% vs 5.6%). The safety profile for grade≥3 TEAEs of blinatumomab in study 20120215 
was similar to pooled RR ALL paediatric population. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/241758/2021  
Page 157/162 
 
 
 
The following TRAEs were more frequent in HC3 arm: anaemia (35.3% for HC3; 3.7% for 
blinatumomab), stomatitis (41.2% vs 1.9%), platelet count decreased (13.7% vs 0%), neutropenia 
(25.5% vs 1.9%), and thrombocytopenia (21.6% vs 1.9%). TRAEs of pyrexia (55.6% for blinatumomab; 
3.9% for HC3) and headache (18.5% vs 2.0% for HC3) were more frequent in blinatumomab arm. 
No fatal TEAE was reported in study 20120215. The frequency of serious TEAEs was lower in 
blinatumomab arm (24.1% vs 43.1%); a similar trend was observed among treatment related serious 
AEs (16.7% vs 27.5%). No unexpected safety finding was retrieved among serious AEs. 
No unexpected trend in AEs leading to Treatment Interruptions and treatment discontinuation was 
observed in study 20120215.  
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) 
Prespecified AESIs were neurologic events, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), infections, elevated liver 
enzymes, infusion reactions, tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), capillary leak syndrome (CLS), medication 
errors, decreased immunoglobulins, embolic and thrombotic events (including disseminated 
intravascular coagulation [DIC]), leukoencephalopathy including progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML), neutropenia and febrile neutropenia, lymphopenia, immunogenicity, and 
pancreatitis. 
Additionally, the following minimum critical toxicities were reviewed: bone marrow toxicity 
(cytopenias), hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and torsade de pointes/QT prolongation, cardiac 
arrhythmias, and convulsion.  
No unexpected safety signal was raised from these AESIs and critical toxicities. 
No safety signal was raised from changes in haematology laboratory parameters, immunoglobulins nor 
from vital signs. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of blinatumomab was similar to pooled RR ALL paediatric population, despite a 
higher frequency of nausea (40.7% for high-risk first relapsed; 22.8% for relapsed/refractory), 
stomatitis (18.5% for high-risk first relapsed; 7.5% for relapsed/refractory), and mucosal 
inflammation (16.7% for high-risk first relapsed; 2.6% for relapsed/refractory) in blinatumomab arm 
in study 20120215. The implication of previous consolidation cycles in the onset of these TEAEs, as 
well as HSCT conditioning, in this population cannot be ruled out.  
The applicant provided a summary table of TEAEs occurred after 31 days after treatment stopped in 
study 20120215. Among them, serious GVHD events were more frequently reported in blinatumomab 
arm: acute GVHD (none in HC3; 1 in blinatumomab arm), GVHD in gastrointestinal tract (1 each) and 
GVHD in skin (none in HC3; 1 in blinatumomab arm). Nevertheless, no safety signal was raised but 
this risk remains to be closely monitored.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The pivotal study, 20120215, enrolled 108 patients (54 per study arm). Most of patients completed 
investigational treatment (99; 91.7%). 
Considering treatment schedule, blinatumomab is part of consolidation therapy. The indication was 
reviewed to clearly reflect this point. 
Median EFS in blinatumomab arm was not reached (vs 7.4 months (95% CI: 4.5; 12.7) in HC3 arm) 
and EFS event incidence was statistically different, in favour of blinatumomab arm (57.4% in the HC3 
arm and 33.3% in the blinatumomab arm). The 36-month KM estimate EFS was 26.9% (13.2% to 
42.8%) in HC3 arm and 55.7% (37.8% to 70.4%) in blinatumomab arm. 
Median OS were not reached at time of interim data cut off. Death incidence was 29.6% in the HC3 
arm and 14.8% in the blinatumomab arm, with a significant difference in both stratified and 
unstratified analysis.  
With PCR method, the difference in MRD response was statistically significant: 54.2% in HC3 arm vs 
89.8% in blinatumomab arm.  
At the cut off date (17 July 2019), 41/48 (85.4%) of patients remained alive in blinatumomab arm, 
and 26/38 (68.4%) in HC3 arm. The median time to death was reached in neither arm. 
No increase in allo HSCT was obtained: 85.2% in HC3 arm and 88.9% in blinatumomab arm. Median 
time to transplant from randomization was similar between both arms (1.7 and 1.9 month in HC3 and 
blinatumomab arms respectively).  
No significant difference in 100-days mortality was observed: 4.2% (1.1; 15.6) in blinatumomab arm 
vs 5.6% (1.4; 20.5) in HC3 arm.  
The safety profile was similar between both arms, and coherent with the known safety profile of 
blinatumomab. 
The randomized study design allows a comparison of results obtained versus SOC. However, the 
following limitations should be taken into account:  
-  A bias in investigator’s assessment cannot be ruled out considering the open label design; 
-  Recruitment in the study was prematurely stopped on  17 July 2019 for efficacy in blinatumomab 
arm, based on DMC recommendation. Thus, study data are limited to primary analysis, in a sample 
size limited to 108 enrolled patients (54 per study arm). The final analysis remains expected, planned 
by 2023. 
Exposure to blinatumomab in the target population was 1.7-fold higher than both adult and pediatric 
with R/R ALL, however the safety profile remain similar between both populations.  
The expected cure rate increase, in terms of 36-month KM EFS estimate, was met. The cure rate in the 
comparative arm was lower than expected, probably overestimated due to treatment improvements 
since protocol design.  
No evaluation of quality of life was provided. Considering the 4 weeks IV continuous treatment with 
blinatumomab, vs one week of HC3 course, this would have been helpful to complete the assessment.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Despite limitations due to limited sample size, open-label design and deviations, efficacy results in the 
target indication are favourable to blinatumomab vs HC3, in terms of EFS and OS estimate, as well as 
RMD response. No significant difference in allo HSCT was obtained.  
The safety profile was similar between both arms, and coherent with the known safety profile of 
blinatumomab.

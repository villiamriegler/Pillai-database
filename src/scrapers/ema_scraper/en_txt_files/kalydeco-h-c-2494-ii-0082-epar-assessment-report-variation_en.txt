Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive, progressive, and life-threatening genetic disease caused 
by mutations in the CF Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene that result in deficient 
CFTR protein function.  
The R117H-CFTR mutation is a missense mutation that results in the replacement of an arginine 
residue at position 117 of CFTR with a histidine residue. Although generally characterized as a Class IV 
conductance mutation, R117H-CFTR is known to exhibit a defect in channel gating which has been 
documented in published studies (Sheppard et al., 1993, Van Goor F et al, 2014) supporting the use of 
ivacaftor for the treatment of patients with CF who have the R117H mutation.  
R117H is a CFTR variant of varying clinical consequences (clinical and functional translation of CFTR, 
CFTR2), i.e. by itself, R117H does not act as a CF-causing variant but under certain circumstances 
(and as always, when another CF-causing variant is present in-trans) R117H can cause disease. 
Whether or not R117H can cause disease is based on another region of the CFTR gene which is a 
polythymidine (Poly-T) repeat polymorphism located in CFTR Intron 8 (IVS8) or poly-T tract. The poly-
T tract is present in every copy of the CFTR gene and occurs in one of three forms: 5T, 7T, or 9T. 
Depending on which poly-T form is present in the same copy of the CFTR gene (i.e. in-cis) with R117H, 
differing outcomes may occur. The combination of R117H/5T with a second CF-causing mutation such

as F508del is expected to result in CF while the combination of R117H/7T is unlikely to act as a 
disease-causing variant (particularly for females) but may result in male infertility. However, a person 
with this combination of variants and this form of the poly-T tract may have borderline or elevated 
sweat chloride and mild clinical symptoms of CF. R117H/9T is highly unlikely to act as a disease-
causing variant; the vast majority of individuals with this combination will not have CF. Nevertheless, 
there may be other genetic and environmental factors which may also play a role on the phenotypic 
expression of the disease in individual patients.  
R117H can be a CF disease-causing CFTR mutation that is associated with residual CFTR function. The 
prevalence of the R117H-CFTR mutation among individuals with CF is estimated to be 1.0% in Europe 
and 5.5% in the UK (2017 ECFS Patient Registry Annual Data Report, UK Cystic Fibrosis Registry: 2017 
Annual Data Report). While on a population basis, patients with residual function CFTR mutations have 
relatively higher rates of pancreatic sufficiency, and a later age of onset of disease manifestations than 
patients homozygous for the F508del mutation (the most common CFTR mutation), R117H patients 
may have a classical CF disease. Median life expectancy of patients with residual function, including 
patients with the R117H-CFTR mutation, is only 50 years, and the median age at death is 38 years in 
the US and 32 years in the UK (Hoo ZH et al, 2014; McKone et al, 2014). These patients may develop 
all the co-morbidities associated with CF including bronchiectasis and recurrent lung infections, 
rhinosinusitis, CF-related diabetes, infertility, and pancreatic insufficiency. 
Data from the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR) show evidence of lung disease 
and decreased percent predicted FEV1 (ppFEV1) in patients 6 to 11 years of age, and a progressive 
loss of lung function with age (see Figure 1 below). In the 12- to 17-year-old subgroup, 17% of 
patients have ppFEV1 ≤90%, and this increases to 59% of patients ≥18 years of age which highlights 
the rationale for earlier intervention. 
Figure 1 Prevalence of lung disease with normal ppFEV1 and reduced ppFEV1 in different 
age groups of patients in the US with the R117H-CFTR mutation
The delayed but progressive nature of CF in patients with the R117H-CFTR mutation was also 
documented by Wagener et al. (2018), using data from the US CFFPR. In this study, the rates of lung 
function decline in children 6 to 12 years of age and 13 to 17 years of age were slower (but present) in 
R117H patients compared to homozygous F508del patients, but the rates in adults (18 to 24 years of 
age and ≥25 years of age) were not significantly different. These data suggest that while disease 
progression is slower in children with R117H, by the time patients are 18 years of age, progression of 
Assessment report

lung disease is comparable to F508del homozygous patients. Thus, patients with the R117H-CFTR 
mutation are likely to benefit from treatment before reaching 18 years of age. In addition, although 
residual function mutations are usually associated with exocrine pancreatic sufficiency, these 
mutations demonstrate a high propensity for ductal blockage and inflammation, resulting in 
pancreatitis. Over time, these episodes of recurrent pancreatitis develop defective acinar pancreatic 
secretion and a decline in pancreatic exocrine function, with 20% becoming pancreatic insufficient 
(Johns JD and Rowe SM, 2019).  
Newborn screening allows individuals with the R117H-CFTR mutation to be identified early in life, often 
before the onset of advanced gastrointestinal or pulmonary manifestations. This provides the 
opportunity for early intervention, ideally before major irreversible organ damage has occurred. While 
most paediatric patients with the R117H-CFTR mutation may not have overt clinical manifestations of 
disease, they are at risk for lung damage and airway inflammation. Lung function decline is delayed 
but not decreased in patients with CF and the R117H gene mutation. 
In the EU there are at present no approved CFTR modulators for the treatment of paediatric patients 
with CF who have an R117H mutation. However, Kalydeco is currently approved for adult patients with 
R117H mutation since September 2015. In this application the MAH is seeking an indication as follows:  
Kalydeco tablets: treatment of adults, adolescents, and children aged 6 years and older and weighing 
25 kg or more with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have an R117H mutation in the CFTR gene.  
Kalydeco granules: treatment of patients with CF aged 6 months and older and weighing 5 kg to less 
than 25 kg who have an R117H mutation in the CFTR gene.   
Of note, during the procedure, the applicant proposed to extend the initial request for Kalydeco 
granules from 12 months to 6 months.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. However, an updated Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) has been provided following 
the assessment of Kalydeco EMEA/H/C/002494/X/0075/G.  The updated ERA submitted as part of this 
application summarised the degradation half-lives for unchanged VX-770 and Metabolite M2 in soil 
calculated according to the recommendations of EMA/CHMP.  
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An environmental risk assessment of VX-770 (ivacaftor) in Kalydeco (Monotherapy) was submitted in 
Module 1.6 in the Marketing Authorisation Application for Kalydeco. This assessment was based on a 
single product at a maximum daily dose of 300 mg.  
Kalydeco is now indicated in tablet form at a daily dose of 300 mg for the treatment of CF in patients 
aged  6  years  and  older  who  have  a  G551D  mutation  or  other  gating  mutations  in  the  CFTR  gene. 
Kalydeco is also indicated in granule form at a daily dose of 150 mg for the treatment of CF in patients 
aged 2 years and older who have mutations in the CFTR gene including G551D. In addition, Kalydeco is 
indicated in tablet form at a daily dose of 300 mg for the treatment of CF in patients aged 18 years and 
older who have a R117H mutation.  
VX-770 is also marketed as Orkambi in combination with VX-809 for the treatment of CF in patients who 
have  been  genotyped  homozygous  for  the  F508del  mutation.  The  maximum  daily  dosage  is  500  mg, 
administered orally.  
Assessment report  
EMA/297262/2020

VX-770 is also to be marketed in combination with VX-661 (Symkevi) and in combination with VX-445 
and VX-661 for the treatment of CF in patients who have been genotyped for total F508del mutations. 
The maximum daily dosage of VX-770 is 300 mg, administered orally.  
The applicant provided an ERA for Kalydeco as prescribed alone or in combination with other drugs, 
that can be summarised as follows:

2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in the application. As requested, the ERA for Kalydeco 
has been updated and data have been provided in this application. Based on available data, the risk of 
ivacaftor to the environment, as previously assessed, remains low. Appropriate recommendations are 
already included in the product information in order to minimize any potential risks to the 
environment.  
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application did not warrant any change to the product information.  
No new non-clinical issues are identified which could preclude the granting of the extension of 
indication for Kalydeco. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
In the EU Kalydeco as monotherapy is approved for patients with CF who have certain gating (class 
III) mutations in the CFTR gene as well as for patients with an R117H-CFTR mutation. For the latter, 
only adult subjects are covered by the indication. The subject of this application is an extension of the 
indication of Kalydeco tablets and granules for the treatment of patients with CF aged 6 months and 
older who have an R117H mutation in the CFTR gene.  
The proposed recommended dose of ivacaftor (IVA) for R117H-CFTR patients is identical to the dose 
approved in children and adolescents with pre-specified gating (class III) CFTR mutations, i.e. 25 mg 
dose for patients weighing between 5 to < 7 kg, 50 mg dose for patients weighing between 7 to <14 
kg, 75 mg dose for patients weighing between 14 to <25 kg, and 150 mg dose for patients weighing 
≥25 kg.  
The following clinical data were submitted to support this application:

-  Study VX11-770-110 (study 110): a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ivacaftor in subjects aged 6 years of age 
and older with cystic fibrosis who have the R117H-CFTR mutation.  
Of note, this study has been previously assessed in variation application EMEA/H/C/002494/II/27 
and led to the granting of an indication for adult patients with an R117H-CFTR mutation based on a 
pre-specified subgroup analysis by age. However, the request for an indication in adolescents 
(n=2) and children (aged 6 and older, n=17) was rejected by CHMP at that time. Further 
information can be found in the published EPAR for EMEA/H/C/002494/II/27.  
-  Study VX12-770-112 (study 112): a phase 3, two-arm, open-label, rollover study to evaluate the 
safety of long-term ivacaftor treatment in subjects 6 years of age and older with cystic fibrosis and 
a non-G551D CFTR mutation and who had previously been enrolled in study 110, study 111 or 
study 113.  
Interim data (until week 12) of study 112 were assessed in EMEA/H/C/002494/II/27, while the 
final study report was submitted later on and assessed in EMEA/H/C/002494/II/0054.  
- 
Interim analysis 2 (IA2) of Study VX15-770-122 (study 122): a study in the Cystic Fibrosis 
Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR) of patients (including patients below 18 years of age) with CF 
who have the R117H-CFTR mutation to confirm the long-term safety and effectiveness of Kalydeco 
where data captured in the CFFPR from an interventional cohort (Kalydeco cohort; no subjects 
enrolled) and a non-interventional cohort (Kalydeco cohort). Study 122 also included an historical 
cohort. Study 122 was requested as a post-marketing commitment by FDA at the time of approval 
of Kalydeco for children aged 6 years and older (and subsequently to younger age groups) who 
have the R117H mutation in the CFTR gene.  
The results of study 122 represent the only new clinical data submitted as part of this application 
and were not previously assessed.  
GCP 
The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The MAH proposed to expand the approved therapeutic indication to include patients with the R117H-
CFTR mutation who are 6 months to <18 years of age, using the film coated tablet (150 mg) and 
granule (75 mg, 50 mg and 25 mg) formulations. Discussion on dose recommendation is detailed 
below.  
2.3.2.1.  PopPK analysis 
Methodology for patients aged 6 years and older 
In procedure EMEA/H/C/002494/II/27, a popPK analysis was conducted via nonlinear mixed effects 
modelling using the previously developed popPK model for IVA. This model was updated with data 
from study 110 (Table 1).  
Consistent with the previous model, IVA PK was described by a 2-compartment model with zero-order 
delivery to the absorption compartment and subsequent first-order absorption. The typical estimates 
(90% CI) of PK model parameters for the reference subject (70 kg, male, 18 years, CF subject, non-
R117H mutation) were 18.2 (16.9, 19.3) L/h for CL/F, 246 (196, 254) L for apparent (oral) central 
volume of distribution (Vc/F), 150 (48.1, 362) L for apparent (oral) peripheral volume of distribution 
(Vp/F), 3.09 (1.98, 14.0) L/h for apparent (oral) intercompartmental clearance (Q/F), 2.96 (2.88, 
3.17) hours for zero-order dose duration (D1) and 0.721 (0.530, 0.765) h-1 for first-order absorption 
rate (ka). The typical CL/F estimate is similar to that reported in the prior popPKmodel. 
Allometric relationships using body weight were incorporated in the base model for all structural 
parameters to describe the effect of body weight on IVA PK.  
Results 
Body weight was the most important predictor of IVA disposition, with a change in IVA CL/F of 39% 
and 131% for the typical 20 kg and 100 kg subject, respectively, when compared to the reference 
subject (70 kg). Gender and patient status (healthy volunteer versus CF patient) did not account for 
variability in IVA PK in a clinically meaningful manner. Age was also not a clinically important covariate 
after accounting for body weight. 
IVA CL/F was reduced 21% for subjects with the R117H-CFTR mutation relative to the non-R117H CF 
population (including other mutations that cause gating defects and F508del homozygotes), with an 
estimate of 14.3 (12.7, 16.0) L/h. However, this difference in the CL/F estimate should be interpreted 
with caution since all the data for R117H subjects came from a single study; therefore, factors such as 
study design and inherent inter-study variability may contribute to the difference in CL/F. This 
difference was not considered to be clinically relevant. IVA exposure (AUC and Cmin) in subjects in 
Study 110 was consistent with exposures observed in previous clinical studies in other CF populations 
(Table 1).

Table 1 Predicted IVA exposure at a dose of 150 mg q12h in CF subjects with R117H-CFTR 
mutation versus studies in CF subjects with other mutations
Ivacaftor exposure in subjects 6 years to 11 years of age at the dose of 150 mg q12h is higher than 
ivacaftor exposure in subjects 18 years of age and older; however, this level of exposure was 
demonstrated to be safe and efficacious in this age group in clinical studies and has been addressed by 
the use of weight cut-offs in the labelling for Kalydeco. For children in this age range weighing 25 kg or 
more, the recommended dose is 150 mg twice daily while for those weighing ≥14 kg to less than 25 kg 
less the dose is 75 mg twice daily. The predicted systemic exposures are reflected in section 5.2 of the 
SmPC of Kalydeco.  
Methodology for patients under 6 years of age 
To support this extension of indication under 6 years of age and support dosing recommendations in 
this age group, key PK data provided in previous ivacaftor submissions from subjects 2 years through 
5 years of age (Study 108) and 12 months to <24 months of age (Study 124) have been summarized 
by the MAH. 
A PopPK analysis was conducted across different age groups of patients 12 months of age and older.  
Results 
Results from the popPK model showed that in subjects 12 months to <24 months of age administered 
either 50 mg (7 kg to <14 kg) or 75 mg (14 kg to <25 kg) IVA granules in Study 124, the exposures 
were generally consistent across the age group. The IVA exposure (Cmin and AUC) in subjects 12 
months to <24 months of age was similar to that observed in the 2 years through 5 years of age group 
administered 50 mg (<14 kg) or 75 mg (≥14 kg) IVA granules in Study 108, and in subjects 12 years 
of age and older in the pivotal Phase 3 Studies 102 and 103. A summary of exposure across age range 
are shown in Figure 1-1 and Figure 1-2.

Figure 1-2 Predicted IVA AUC distribution in subjects with CF by age group
For patients below 6 years of age, predicted IVA exposures in subjects 12 months to <6 years of age 
from previous submissions (Studies 124 and 108) were demonstrated to be similar to that observed in 
subjects 12 years of age and older in the Phase 3 pivotal studies (Studies 102 and 103). The PK results 
from Studies 124 and 108 confirm the appropriateness of the 50 mg dose for subjects weighing 
between 7 kg to <14 kg and the 75 mg dose for subjects weighing between 14 kg to <25 kg in the 12 
months to <6 years of age group and thus, would be anticipated to be applicable for the R117H 
population in that genotype has not been identified as a relevant covariate influencing ivacaftor 
pharmacokinetics. 
Exposure parameters (Cmin and AUC) for IVA in CF subjects, as determined from the popPK model, 
are compared across age groups in Table 2.

Table 2: Predicted IVA Exposure in CF Subjects by Age 
In procedure EMEA/H/C/002492/X/75, population PK analysis was also conducted across different age 
groups of patients 6 months of age and older to support dosing recommendations for infants aged 6 to 
less than 12 months. This analysis led to the conclusion that age was not a covariate influencing 
ivacaftor pharmacokinetics but the number of children treated with the ivacaftor lower dose (25 mg) 
was very limited. Therefore, the MAH was requested to update the pop PK model with available 
pharmacokinetic (PK) data from a younger (than 6 months) and lower (than 5 kg) weight cohort 
treated in Study 124 (PK data from Part A, Cohort 3; subjects 3 to <6 months of age; N = 6). Results 
from several models were provided, including  a refit model which incorporated only allometric scaling 
(Model 2), as well as additional models incorporating maturation and/or an empirical weight 
relationship on apparent oral clearance (e.g., Model 4).  Figure 2 shows predicted IVA AUC0-12hr at 
steady-state for different dosing regimens for the paediatric population aged months to less than 12 
months of age.

For infants aged 6 to less than 12 months of age and weighing at least 5 kg to less than 7 kg dosed 
with ivacaftor 25 mg twice daily, predicted Cmin, ss and AUCtau,ss are 336 ng/ml and 5410 ng*h/mL 
respectively. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Ivacaftor is a potentiator of the CFTR protein, i.e. in vitro ivacaftor increases CFTR channel gating to 
enhance chloride transport in specified mutations with reduced channel-open probability compared to 
normal CFTR. Ivacaftor also potentiated the channel-open probability of R117H-CFTR, which has both 
low channel-open probability (gating) and reduced channel current amplitude (conductance). The 
mechanism of action of ivacaftor has not been completely elucidated and further studies are needed to 
identify the site of ivacaftor binding on CFTR. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
A summary of the data previously assessed for study 110 is provided below. 
The mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride through week 24 (MMRM analysis) was -
26.28 mmol/L for the ivacaftor group and -2.31 mmol/L for the placebo group. The treatment 
difference for ivacaftor versus placebo was -23.97 mmol/L (95% CI: -28.01, -19.93). In the ivacaftor 
Assessment report

group, 85.3% (29 out of the 34 subjects in the Full Analysis Set) had a reduction ≥ 10 mmol/l and 
76.5% (26/34) had a reduction ≥ 15 mmol/l.  
In the subgroup of patients ≥ 18 years of age, the mean absolute change from baseline was -25.90 
mmol/L for the ivacaftor group and -4.03 mmol/L for the placebo group. The treatment difference for 
ivacaftor versus placebo was -21.87 mmol/L (95% CI: -26.46, -17.28). In subjects <12 years of age, 
the mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride through week 24 was -26.59 mmol/L for the 
ivacaftor group and 1.04 mmol/L for the placebo group. The treatment difference for ivacaftor versus 
placebo was -27.63 mmol/L (95% CI: -37.16, -18.10).  
Only two adolescent subjects were randomised in study 110, one to ivacaftor and the other to placebo. 
The subject on ivacaftor showed a -17.25 mmol/L absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride 
which was slightly below  the mean value seen in subjects ≥18 years of age in the ivacaftor group (-
25.90  mmol/L) and in children 6 to less than 12 years old (-26.59 mmol/L).  
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application regarding secondary pharmacology, which 
is considered acceptable. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
PK - children aged 6 years and older  
Dosing recommendations were supported by an updated pop-PK report which included data from study 
110 previously submitted in the variation application extending the indication of Kalydeco in adult 
patients with R117H mutation (refer to EMEA/H/C/002494/II/27). The base model incorporated weight 
as an allometric function for all structural parameters. Sex, age and patient status did not explain in a 
clinically meaningful way the variability in ivacaftor PK. Ivacaftor CL/F was reduced by 21% in patients 
with the R117H mutation compared to CF subjects with a gating mutation. Ivacaftor Cmin and AUC 
values in study 110 overlapped with the values observed in previous studies with other mutations.  
Similarly, PK data from children aged 6 to 11 years in study 110 showed the same trend as that seen 
in studies 103 and 111, i.e. exposure at the dose of 150 mg twice daily was higher in children than in 
adults.  
An ivacaftor dose of 150 mg q12h achieved a mean Cmin,ss of 1240 ng/mL in paediatric patients from 
6 to 11 years of age while the same dose resulted in a mean Cmin,ss of 701 ng/mL in adult subjects. 
Mean AUC was 20,000 ng/mL.h for 6 to 11 years old, compared to 10,700 g/mL.h for adults.  
However, this level of exposure was demonstrated to be safe and efficacious in this age group in 
clinical studies with patients with other type of mutations. Further, this has been addressed by the use 
of weight cut-off for the posology in the product information for Kalydeco for children aged 6 to less 
than 12 years old. 
PK - children under 6 years of age 
Following responses to the request from CHMP during the procedure, the MAH proposed to further 
extend the R117H mutation indication to include patients with the R117H-CFTR mutation who are 6 
months to <18 years of age, using the film coated tablet (150 mg) and granule (75 mg, 50 mg, and 
25 mg) formulations.  
The proposed recommended dose of ivacaftor (IVA) for R117H-CFTR patients is identical to the dose 
for the other approved genotypes in the same weight group, i.e. 25 mg dose for patients weighing 
between 5 to < 7 kg, 50 mg dose for patients weighing between 7 to <14 kg, 75 mg dose for patients 
weighing between 14 to <25 kg, and 150 mg dose for patients weighing ≥25 kg. 
Assessment report  
EMA/297262/2020  
Page 18/119 
 
 
 
For children under the age of 6 years, dosing recommendations are based on PK data from study 108 
(children aged 2 to less than 6 years with CF who have a [pre-specified] gating [class III] mutation in 
the CFTR gene [refer to EMEA/H/C/002494/X/34]) and on an interim analysis of study 124 in children 
down to 6 months of age (refer to EMEA/H/C/002494/II/0069 and EMEA/H/C/002492/X/75).  
Results from the popPK model showed that in subjects 6 months to <24 months of age administered 
either 25 mg (5 kg to < 7 kg), 50 mg (7 kg to <14 kg) or 75 mg (14 kg to <25 kg) IVA granules in 
study 124, the exposures were generally consistent across the age groups.  
Dose regimens and associated PK data have been established for children with CF ≥6 months of age 
with CF who have at least a predefined gating (class III) mutations in the CFTR gene. Predicted IVA 
exposures in subjects 6 months through 5 years of age from Studies 124 and 108 were similar to 
those observed in the Phase 3 pivotal studies in subjects 12 years of age and older. The PK results 
from Studies 124 and 108 confirmed the appropriateness of the 25 mg dose for subjects weighing 
between 5 to < 7 kg, the 50 mg dose  for subjects weighing between 7 to <14 kg and the 75 mg dose 
for subjects weighing between 14 to <25 kg in the 6 months through 5 years of age group. 
The most prevalent genotype in studies 108 and 124 was G551D/F508del. Taking into consideration 
that genotype was not identified as a relevant covariate explaining variability of IVA PK and the safety 
profile was overall similar and acceptable across age groups and genotypes, CHMP considered that the 
approved posology for children aged 6 months (weighing at least 5 kg) and older with CF who have a 
(pre-specified) gating (class III) mutation in the CFTR gene is applicable to children of the same age 
and body weight with CF who have an R117H-CFTR mutation.  
Pharmacodynamics 
In study 110, in the 6 to 11 years of age group, a pharmacodynamic effect on CFTR function was 
shown with a -26.59 mmol/L reduction in sweat chloride in the ivacaftor group. The improvement 
(reduction) observed in sweat chloride was similar in magnitude across all age groups in study 110.  
While this is understood as a confirmation of activity at the cellular level, at the time of assessment of 
variation EMEA/H/C/002494/II/27, it was not considered sufficient to conclude on the efficacy of 
ivacaftor for paediatric subjects under 12 years of age (i.e. as a surrogate for clinical improvement). 
Since then additional data have been generated across different CFTR mutations and genotypes which 
show that the effects of CFTR modulators on sweat chloride generally parallel the clinical benefits 
observed in the patient population for which their use is intended (Muhlebach MS et al, 2016) e.g. the 
highest reduction in sweat chloride with ivacaftor has been observed in subjects with gating (class III) 
mutations where the highest clinical benefit was also achieved.  
Given that intermediate effects are observed with ivacaftor in CF patients with the R117H mutation, 
moderate clinical improvements could very likely be expected in this patient population taking into 
account that individual changes in sweat chloride have not correlated directly with FEV1 improvements 
(Fidler MC et al, 2017).  
Overall, exposure in the 6 to 11 years of age group in Study 110 is within the range of adult 
exposures, and a PD effect on CFTR function was shown. While a lack of FEV1 response was observed 
in R117H subjects 6 to 11 years of age in study 110, the PK findings seemed to indicate that this was 
not due to inadequate dosing or drug exposure, but rather to small sample size and large variability, 
as well as difficulty in showing IVA’s effect in younger subjects with well-preserved lung function.

2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of IVA is well understood and is consistent across genotypes and among age 
ranges down to the age of 6 months. Based on the PK data presented by the MAH, the CHMP 
considered that the proposed recommended posology of ivacaftor for CF paediatric patients with 
R117H-CFTR mutation was sufficiently justified. Dosing recommendations are therefore as follows:  
-  25 mg twice daily for patients weighing between 5 to < 7 kg 
-  50 mg twice daily for patients weighing between 7 kg to <14 kg 
-  75 mg twice daily for patients weighing between 14 kg to <25 kg 
-  150 mg twice daily for patients weighing ≥25 kg 
The above treatment recommendations are identical to the recommendations already approved for 
patients with class III gating mutations. 
The CHMP also considered that from a pharmacodynamic point of view, treatment with ivacaftor of 
patients carrying a R117H mutation is justified as the predominant in vitro defect of the mutated 
R117H-CFTR protein is a defect in channel gating, although R117H is usually classified as a class IV, 
i.e. conductance mutation. Further, the magnitude of sweat chloride reduction after treatment with 
ivacaftor was similar in children and adults.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No dose-response studies have been performed. Dosing recommendations are based on a population 
PK model analysis of the similarity of ivacaftor systemic exposure between paediatric and adult 
patients. The popPK analysis was based on studies which enrolled mainly patients with some pre-
specified gating (class III) mutations i.e. children below 6 years of age in study 108 (2 to less than 6 
years of age) and in study 124 (children below 2 years of age). Detailed information is provided in the 
pharmacology section. This approach was considered acceptable by CHMP as in population PK analysis 
genotype was not identified as a significant covariate explaining variability in ivacaftor 
pharmacokinetics. Therefore, dosing recommendations for children with these gating mutations are 
considered applicable to children with an R117H-CFTR mutation.  
2.4.2.  Main study 
2.4.2.1.  Study VX11-770-110 
This study has previously been assessed in variation (EMEA/H/C/002494/II/27). 
Title of Study 
Study VX11-770-110: A Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-
group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ivacaftor in subjects with cystic fibrosis 
who have the R117H-CFTR mutation.

Methods 
Study participants 
The pivotal study for the proposed extension to the indication of Kalydeco is study VX11-770-110 
(study 110).  
Figure 3. Schematic of Study Design VX11-770-110 
The study included a Screening Period (Day -35 to Day -15 relative to the first dose of study drug), a 
Run-In Period (Day -14 to Day -1 relative to the first dose of study drug), a Treatment Period (Day 1 
[first dose of study drug] through Week 24), and a Follow-up period 3 to 4 weeks after the last week 
of study drug. Study visits during the Treatment Period occurred on Day 1, Weeks 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24. 
Patients were offered after the Follow-up period to be enrolled in study 112. 
Patients with CF, age 6 years and older, who have a R117H-CFTR mutation were enrolled provided that 
they met all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria as follows (only key criteria 
shown):  
Key inclusion criteria 
1. 
Male or female patients aged 6 years (on the date of signed ICF, and where appropriate data 
of assent) and older with confirmed diagnosis of CF, defined as: 
• 
a sweat chloride value ≥60 mmol/L by quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis OR 2 CF-
causing mutations (all as documented in the subject’s medical record) 
AND 
• 
chronic sinopulmonary disease 
2.  Must have had at least 1 allele of the R117H-CFTR mutation 
3. FEV1 predicted normal for age, sex, and height (Hankinson or Wang equations) at screening: 
•  40% to 90% inclusive for subjects aged 12 years or older 
•  40% to 105% inclusive for subjects aged 6 to 11 years 
All subjects enrolled in this study would have had the R117H-5T or R117H-7T alleles because the study 
entry criteria required that subjects have CF, as evidenced by sinopulmonary disease and a sweat 
chloride ≥60 mmol/L or 2 CF-causing mutations. CFTR genotyping provided the subjects' poly-T 
variant genotype, but it did not specify which CFTR allele each variant was located on (i.e. the phase of 
the mutation) because that requires a different sequencing assay (allele-specific long-range PCR). 
Assessment report  
EMA/297262/2020  
Page 21/119 
 
 
 
 
Therefore, allele-specific long-range PCR was conducted using an optional DNA sample (Sample A) 
from the subjects who consented to that sample. 
For subjects who either had DNA samples that could not be analysed or did not consent to the optional 
DNA samples, the poly-T variant for the R117H allele was derived if the subject had either a 
R117H/F508del or R117H/R117H genotype. All subjects who had the R117H/F508del genotype had 
one 9T variant; it was assumed that the 9T was on the F508del allele, and therefore the other variant 
(5T or 7T) was on the R117H allele. This assumption was considered valid because: (1) if a subject 
had R117H-9T they would have had a very mild disease phenotype (e.g., sweat chloride <60 mmol/L) 
and would not have qualified for entry into the study, and (2) a survey of the scientific literature 
indicates that the F508del allele has always been reported with the 9T variant except in some 
Lebanese Maronites (Desgeorges M et al, 1997), North Iranian individual (Tabaripour R et al, 2012) 
and 1 Hispanic individual (Dharajiya N et al, 2013). For subjects who did not have either a 
R117H/F508del or R117H/R117H genotype, the 5T/7T status for the R117H allele could not be derived. 
Key exclusion criteria 
1.  CFTR gene mutation leading to CFTR channel with gating defect (i.e. any 1 of the following 
mutations: G551D, G178R, G551S, S549N, S549R, G970R, G1244E, S1251N, S1255P, or G1349D) 
2.  An acute upper or lower respiratory infection, pulmonary exacerbation, or changes in therapy 
(including antibiotics) for pulmonary disease within 4 weeks before Day 1 (first dose of study 
drug). 
3.  Abnormal liver function, at screening, defined as ≥3 × upper limit of normal (ULN), of any 3 or 
more of the following: serum aspartate transaminase (AST), serum alanine transaminase (ALT), 
gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), serum alkaline phosphatise (ALP), total bilirubin. 
4.  History of solid organ or hematological transplantation. 
5.  Colonization with organisms associated with a more rapid decline in pulmonary status (e.g. 
Burkholderia cenocepacia, Burkholderia dolosa, and Mycobacterium abscessus) at screening. 
6.  Current or prior (within 14 days before study Day 1) use of any inhibitors or inducers of 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A, including consumption of certain herbal medications (e.g., St. John’s 
Wort) and grapefruit/grapefruit juice. 
7.  Evidence of cataract or lens opacity at Screening. 
Treatments 
Study drug (ivacaftor 150 mg or ivacaftor-matched placebo) was administered every 12 hours with 
fat-containing food such as a standard “CF” high-fat, high-calorie meal or snack for up to 24 weeks. 
Subjects should remain on stable CF medication regimens from 4 weeks before study Day 1 through 
the Follow-up Visit. 
Objectives 
Primary objective: to evaluate the efficacy of ivacaftor in subjects with CF who have a R117H-CFTR 
mutation. 
Secondary Objective: to evaluate the safety of ivacaftor in subjects with CF who have a R117H-CFTR 
mutation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/297262/2020  
Page 22/119 
 
 
 
Tertiary Objective: to characterize the plasma PK of ivacaftor and metabolites, hydroxymethyl-
ivacaftor (M1) and ivacaftor carboxylate (M6), at steady state in subjects with CF who have the 
R117H-CFTR mutation. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint: absolute change from baseline in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 
second (FEV1) through Week 24.   
Secondary Endpoints: 
•  Rate of change from baseline in body mass index (BMI) at Week 24. 
•  Absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride concentration through Week 24.  
•  Change from baseline in the respiratory domain score of the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-
Revised (CFQ-R) through Week 24.  
• 
Time-to-first pulmonary exacerbation. 
•  Safety, as determined by adverse events, clinical laboratory values (serum chemistry, 
hematology, and coagulation), electrocardiogram (ECG), ophthalmologic examinations, and 
vital signs.  
A number of tertiary endpoints were also assessed such as pulmonary exacerbations, change from 
baseline in immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT), change from baseline in faecal elastase-1 etc.   
Sample size 
Enrolment was planned for a minimum of 40 and a maximum of approximately 80 subjects in total 
who have the R117H-CFTR mutation on at least 1 allele. Table 3 presents the estimated study power 
for detecting different treatment effect sizes between the ivacaftor and placebo groups in the absolute 
change in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline through the Week 24 Visit, assuming 40, 60, or 80 
randomized subjects. Subjects were randomized in 1:1 ratio. The treatment effect sizes and standard 
deviation are based on the results of Study 102 and Study 103, and a review of the clinical CF 
literature.

An interim analysis (IA) for safety and efficacy was carried out after 40 subjects completed the Week 8 
Visit. The IA data were reviewed by the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). Vertex clinical study 
personnel remained blinded to IA results. In order to control the overall type I error rate, a Bonferroni-
type adjustment was applied. This reflected an allocated significance of 0.0052 for the IA. The 
significance level for the final analysis was set at 0.0448 as enrolment was not stopped after the IA.  
Based upon the existing power calculations for the study and after exceeding the minimum number of 
subjects defined in the study protocol, the study was terminated early by the sponsor and recruitment 
was halted after 70 subjects were randomized. Subjects completed all protocol-defined study visits 
prior to the closure of the study including the Follow-up Visit. Subjects who did not have their Week 24 
Visit were considered to have completed their assigned treatment duration and were offered enrolment 
in the open-label treatment arm of Study 112; subjects who chose not to enrol in the open-label 
treatment arm were offered enrolment in the observational arm of Study 112. All available data was 
included in the final analyses regardless of whether subjects completed 24 weeks of study drug 
treatment or not. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio, stratifying for age (≥18 years, 12 to 17 years [inclusive], and 
6 to 11 years [inclusive]) and percent predicted FEV1 severity (<70%, ≥70% to ≤90% [inclusive], and 
>90%) to receive either 150-mg ivacaftor or ivacaftor-matching placebo q12h (in addition to their 
usual prescribed CF therapy). 
Blinding (masking) 
Ivacaftor-matched placebo was administered to subjects in the control group. 
The subjects, all site personnel including the investigator, the study monitor, and the Vertex study 
team remained blinded to treatment assignments until database lock and study unblinding, with the 
exception of any site personnel for whom this information was important to ensure the safety of the 
subject and their fetus in case of pregnancy or in case of a life-threatening medical emergency; Vertex 
staff to satisfy SAE processing regulations; unblinded biostatisticians; IWRS vendor; a member of 
DMPK sample management, Vertex clinical supply chain; DMC; etc. 
Sweat chloride laboratory personnel were unblinded to the sweat chloride results but remained blinded 
to treatment assignment.  
A single member of Vertex DMPK Sample Management, independent from the study team, was 
unblinded for the purpose of assembling samples intended for bioanalysis.  
Subjects and their parent/caregiver should not have been informed of their study-related spirometry 
results during the Treatment Period (through Week 24). 
Statistical methods 
The statistical analysis plan (SAP), Final Version 2.0, dated 15 November 2013 is for the Final Analysis 
of Study VX11-770-110 (Study 110) data and is based on the approved clinical study protocol (CSP), 
dated 11 June 2013, Version 4.0 and the approved electronic case report form (eCRF), dated 19 March 
2013, Version 6.0.  
Analysis sets 
Assessment report  
EMA/297262/2020  
Page 24/119 
 
 
 
The following analysis sets were defined:  
• 
Full Analysis Set (FAS): The FAS will include all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose 
of study drug (i.e., ivacaftor or placebo). Subjects will be analysed according to the study drug to 
which they were assigned. All analyses of background data and efficacy data will be performed 
using the FAS. 
•  Complete Case Set (CCS): The CCS will include all FAS subjects who had the opportunity to 
complete the full 24-week treatment period. The CCS will only be performed for primary and key 
secondary endpoints to assess the impact of early termination of the study which resulted in a 
small number of subjects being unable to complete 24 weeks of assessment. 
• 
Per Protocol Set (PPS): The PPS will include all FAS subjects without major protocol violations (i.e., 
subjects who have not been determined to have violated protocol requirements). Major protocol 
violations are defined as violations that may have a substantial impact on efficacy assessment. The 
criteria to be used for excluding subjects from the PPS will be determined before the database lock 
and will be documented. The PPS analyses will only be performed for the primary endpoint to 
provide supportive evidence for efficacy. 
•  Safety Set: The Safety Set will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug (i.e., 
ivacaftor or placebo). Subjects will be analysed according to the study drug they actually received. 
All summaries of safety will be based on the Safety Set. 
Statistical analysis of the primary efficacy variable 
The primary analysis for the primary efficacy variable was based on a mixed-effects model for 
repeated measures (MMRM). The model included absolute change from baseline in percent predicted 
FEV1 as the dependent variable, treatment (ivacaftor versus placebo), visit (Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, 
Week 16, and Week 24), and treatment by visit interaction as fixed effects, and subject as a random 
effect, with adjustment for the continuous baseline values of age and percent predicted FEV1. In the 
model, visit was treated as a class variable and a compound symmetry covariance matrix was 
assumed to model the within-subject variability. Denominator degrees of freedom for the F-test for 
fixed effects was estimated using the Kenward-Roger approximation. With a mixed-effects model as 
the primary analysis model based on maximum likelihood estimation and assuming that conditional on 
fixed and random effects, data were assumed missing at random and no imputation of missing data 
was done. 
The main effect of treatment obtained from the model was interpreted as the average treatment effect 
(effect of ivacaftor) across all post-baseline visits. This was a weighted average of the treatment effect 
across all post-baseline visits under the no treatment by visit interaction model. The estimated mean 
treatment effect, a 95% confidence interval (CI), and a 2-sided P value was provided. The consistency 
of treatment effect over different visits was evaluated using the above model. If there was evidence of 
a qualitative treatment by visit interaction, a descriptive summary of the treatment difference for each 
visit was used to identify the nature of the interaction. 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary variable 
The following sensitivity analyses of the primary variable were performed to assess the robustness of 
the primary analysis: 
•  Nonparametric analysis: Stratified Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Van Elteren test) on the mean change 
from baseline in percent predicted FEV1, stratified by baseline values of age group (≥18 years of 
age, 12 to 17 years [inclusive], 6 to 11 years [inclusive]) and FEV1 severity (<70%, 70% to 90% 
[inclusive], >90% of the predicted value). If the number of subjects in a stratum was less than 5 
subjects per treatment group, the stratum was collapsed with others to create meaningful

comparison categories. The mean change in percent predicted FEV1 was the mean change from 
baseline across all post-baseline visits for each subject. 
With a mixed-effects model as the primary analysis model, no imputation of missing data was done. 
However, the following sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of missing efficacy 
evaluations on the treatment effect estimated through MMRM: 
• 
Pattern mixture model (PMM): Assessment of the effect of missing patterns on treatment effect, 
and an overall treatment effect were obtained from the PMM, if there was more than 10% missing 
data in either treatment group. 
•  Dropout reason-based multiple imputation: For subjects who terminated from treatment prior to 
the end of the analysis period for any of the following reasons: adverse event, noncompliance with 
study procedures, death, physician decision, or required prohibited medication, missing 
measurements were imputed using a multiple imputation method. Complete data were analyzed 
using ANCOVA and MI ANALYZE; multiple-imputation was performed to remedy loss of variance 
information.  
The imputation distribution for the missing change in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline at 
Week 24 was a normal distribution.  
All randomized subjects were classified as Completer, Dropout Category 1, or Dropout Category 2, 
based on the following rules: 
•  Completer: Subjects completed 24 weeks treatment duration 
•  Dropout Category 1: Subjects discontinued treatment due to adverse events, 
noncompliance with study requirements, death, physician decision, or requires prohibited 
medication. 
•  Dropout Category 2: Subjects discontinued treatment due to all other reasons, including 
study termination. 
If any of the sensitivity analyses used to assess the impact of missing efficacy evaluations yielded a 
result that was inconsistent with the result of the primary analysis, the nature of the discrepancy was 
to be examined and discussed in the clinical study report. 
Subgroup analyses of the primary variable 
Due to small sample size, subgroup analyses were primarily descriptive in nature and consisted of 
summary statistics. These subgroup analyses were used to examine the consistency of treatment 
effect across subgroups. If an adequate sample size (i.e., ≥5 subjects in both treatment groups) was 
available in any of the subgroups described below, a model-based analysis similar to that described for 
the primary analysis was conducted within the subgroup. Minimally, summary statistics were provided 
by treatment group at each visit. The FAS was used for all subgroup summaries/analyses. 
The following subgroups were used: 
•  Age Group at Baseline (≥18 years, 12 to 17 years [inclusive], and 6 to 11 years [inclusive]) 
• 
Percent Predicted FEV1 severity at Baseline (<70%, 70% to 90% [inclusive], and >90% of the 
predicted value) 
•  Geographic Region (North America and Europe) 
•  Sex (Female and Male) 
• 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P aeruginosa) infection status at baseline (Yes and No)

•  R117H poly-T variant (5T, 7T, 9T). 
Ad hoc analyses 
Following database lock, ad hoc analyses were carried out to gain a better understanding of the main 
study results. These analyses were primarily focused on understanding any potential differences in 
results due to subject age, baseline percent predicted FEV1, and R117H allele poly-T variant. 
Additional summary statistics were also carried out based on subject age, baseline percent predicted 
FEV1, and genotype characteristics. 
Interim analysis 
An interim analysis (IA) for safety and efficacy was carried out after 40 subjects had completed the 
Week 8 visit. In order to control the overall type I error rate, a Bonferroni-type adjustment was 
applied. This reflected an allocated significance of 0.0052 for the IA. The significance level for the final 
analysis (week 24) will be set at 0.0448 as enrolment was not stopped after the IA.  
The IA was conducted by a CRO independent of the sponsor; the CRO communicated directly with the 
DMC, as described in DMC Charter. Following review of the IA data and after applying the pre-specified 
rules, the DMC recommended to Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to continue with enrolment.

Table 4 Subject Disposition 
One hundred and eight patients were screened out of whom 70 patients were randomised to ivacaftor 
(n=34) or to placebo (n=36). Thirty-eight screened patients were not randomized and hence not 
dosed. One subject was randomized to placebo but was not dosed.  
Four subjects in the ivacaftor group and 2 subjects in the placebo group were excluded from the PPS 
due to major protocol violations. 
Four subjects in the ivacaftor group and 4 subjects in the placebo group were excluded from the CCS 
because they did not complete the full 24-week treatment period. 
A total of 67 subjects (32 in the ivacaftor group and 35 in the placebo group) completed their full 
assigned duration of dosing. Two subjects in the ivacaftor group discontinued treatment prematurely: 
1 because of noncompliance with the ophthalmologic examination and 1 because of pregnancy. Of the 
Assessment report

67 subjects who completed the assigned duration of dosing, 59 subjects (28 in the ivacaftor group and 
31 subjects in the placebo group) completed the full 24-week Treatment Period. The remaining 8 
subjects did not complete 24 weeks of treatment because the study was terminated early by the 
sponsor. For these 8 subjects, the last Treatment Period study visit was: Week 2 for 2 subjects, Week 
4 for 1 subject, Week 8 for 3 subjects, and Week 16 for 2 subjects. These subjects were considered to 
have completed their assigned treatment duration. 
Recruitment 
Study initiation was 03 July 2012 (date first eligible subject signed informed consent form) and study 
completion was 25 October 2013 (date last subject completed the last visit).  
Subjects were randomized at 27 study sites in North America (25) and Europe (2 centres in the UK 
where 15 patients were randomised).  
Conduct of the study 
The clinical study protocol was amended 4 times, 1 of which was a country-specific amendment for the 
UK, by the time of the data cut for this clinical study report (CSR). The final protocol (Version 4.0) is 
dated 11 June 2013.  
The main amendments were related to the clarification of the statistical analysis that was to be 
performed for the interim analysis and the control of the type I error. Also, amendments had to be 
implemented to deal with the analysis of patients who had not had their Week 24 Visit completed in 
the event of early study termination. These patients were to be considered to have completed their 
assigned treatment duration. In addition, clarifications were provided regarding concomitant 
medication, e.g. cycling antibiotic therapy. The exclusion of hypertonic saline use as part of the 
concomitant medication was removed. 
Baseline data 
All subjects in both treatment groups were white, and the majority of subjects in both treatment 
groups were of non-Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (placebo: 100%; ivacaftor: 97.1%). The mean age 
was 32.7 years (range: 6 to 68 years) for the placebo group and 29.2 years (range: 6 to 55 years) for 
the ivacaftor group. There were 19 subjects overall in the <18 years subgroup (2 of whom were 12 to 
17 years of age) and 50 subjects overall in the ≥18 years subgroup. 
Baseline percent predicted FEV1 and BMI were slightly higher in the ivacaftor group than in the 
placebo group, and baseline sweat chloride and P aeruginosa infection rate were slightly lower for the 
ivacaftor group than the placebo group. In data from subjects for whom the R117H allele poly-T 
variant was confirmed or derived, the R117H-5T variant was more prevalent in the placebo group 
(placebo: 27 of 34 subjects; ivacaftor: 21 of 33 subjects).  
The mean sweat chloride value of about 70 mmol/L for the FAS is consistent with the residual function 
phenotype generally associated with the R117H-CFTR mutation. 
Selected baseline data are shown in Table 5 by age group.

Numbers analysed 
All efficacy and exploratory analyses were conducted using the FAS, which included 69 subjects who 
were randomized and received at least 1 dose of study drug (35 on placebo and 34 on ivacaftor).  
Sixty-seven (35 in the placebo group and 32 in the ivacaftor group) completed their full assigned 
duration of dosing. Two subjects in the ivacaftor group discontinued treatment prematurely: 1 because 
of noncompliance with the ophthalmologic examination and 1 because of pregnancy. Of the 67 
subjects who completed the assigned duration of dosing, 59 subjects (28 in the ivacaftor group and 31 
subjects in the placebo group) completed the full 24-week Treatment Period. The remaining 8 subjects 
did not complete 24 weeks of treatment because the study was terminated early by the sponsor. For 
these 8 subjects, the last Treatment Period study visit was: Week 2 for 2 subjects, Week 4 for 1 
subject, Week 8 for 3 subjects, and Week 16 for 2 subjects. Out of the 8 patients who did not 
complete 24 weeks of treatment 3 were children and 5 adult patients. Their genotype was 
R117H/F508del (n=7) and R117H/R117H (n=1). Their poly-T status was 5T/9T (n=6), 7T/7T (n=1) 
and 7T/9T.  
The CCS comprises 61 patients (31 on placebo and 30 on ivacaftor) and the PPS includes 63 (33 
subjects in the placebo group and 30 subjects in the ivacaftor group). Six patients were excluded from 
the PPS for major protocol violations. 
Limited analyses of efficacy were conducted using the PPS and CCS. Both pre-planned and ad hoc FAS 
subgroup analyses were performed for primary and secondary endpoints. Tables and figures generated 
as a result of ad hoc analyses are indicated by an “ad” at the end of the table number.

The mean absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 24 by MMRM for the FAS was 
greater for the ivacaftor group (2.57 percentage points) than the placebo group (0.46 percentage 
points). The estimated treatment difference for ivacaftor versus placebo was 2.11 percentage points 
(95% CI: -1.13, 5.35, P=0.1979). The absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 including the Follow-
up Visit is provided in Figure 4 which shows that the change seen in ppFEV1 for the ivacaftor group 
during the treatment period reversed in the Follow-up Period when the subjects were no longer 
receiving ivacaftor.

Figure 5 Waterfall plot of absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 by 
treatment, Full Analysis Set 
Out of the 28 subjects in the ivacaftor group who completed 24 weeks of treatment, 20 had an 
improvement in ppFEV1 after 24 weeks of treatment, 1 had no change, and 7 had a decline in ppFEV1. 
Six of the 7 subjects in the ivacaftor group who had a decline in ppFEV1 were children 6 to 11 years 
old.  
A responder analysis was conducted by categorizing the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 
through Week 24 as ≥3.5% or <3.5%, ≥5% or <5%, ≥7.5% or <7.5%, ≥10% or <10%. Results are 
presented in Table 9 and show that the number of responders favours ivacaftor at all thresholds, with 
approximately twice as many responders in the ivacaftor group as the placebo group.

The majority of subjects in the ivacaftor group who had ≥5 mmol/L decrease in sweat chloride at Week 
24 also had ≥15 mmol/L decrease at Week 24. Only 1 subject (2.9%) in the placebo group achieved a 
≥15 mmol/L decrease in sweat chloride compared to 21 subjects (61.8%) in the ivacaftor group. 
Absolute change from baseline in BMI (secondary efficacy variable) 
The absolute of change from baseline in BMI at Week 24 by LMM is shown in Table 12.  
Table 12 Rate of change from baseline in BMI (kg/m2) by LMM, Full Analysis Set 
BMI-for-age z-scores were calculated using the CDC growth chart for the 22 subjects who were 20 
years of age or younger. The rate of change from baseline in BMI-for-age z-score at Week 24 by LMM 
was greater for the ivacaftor group (0.13 points) than the placebo group (0.03 points). However, the 
treatment difference of 0.10 points (95% CI: -0.57, 0.77) was not statistically significant (P = 
0.7692).  
Time-to-First Pulmonary Exacerbation (secondary efficacy variable) 
Figure 7 presents the survival curves by treatment group for time-to-first pulmonary exacerbation. The 
calculated hazard ratio of 0.928 favoured ivacaftor but was not statistically significant (P = 0.8556).

The number of events and model-based estimates of event rates of pulmonary exacerbations through 
Week 24 (tertiary efficacy variables) are summarized in Table 13. The event rate of pulmonary 
exacerbations was similar, but numerically favoured ivacaftor (ivacaftor: 0.249; placebo: 0.295); the 
rate ratio was 0.843 (95% CI: 0.409, 1.737, p value = 0.6432). Rates for subcategories of pulmonary 
exacerbations (i.e., requiring hospitalization and requiring IV antibiotics) were not calculated due to 
low event incidence, however, the number of events requiring hospitalization or IV antibiotics was 
notably lower for the ivacaftor group.

Change from Baseline in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score (secondary efficacy variable) 
Four versions of the questionnaire were used: 3 in which the subject was interviewed or information 
was self-reported (Children Ages 6 to 11 Years, Children Ages 12 to 13 Years, and Adolescents and 
Adults) and 1 in which the subject's parent or caregiver was the respondent (Parent/Caregiver). Pooled 
questionnaire analyses were defined as all questionnaire versions except for the Parent/Caregiver 
version. 
The mean absolute change from baseline in the pooled CFQ-R respiratory domain score through Week 
24 by MMRM is presented in Table 14.

Table 14 Absolute change from baseline in pooled CFQ-R respiratory domain score by 
MMRM, Full Analysis Set 
The mean absolute change from baseline in the pooled CFQ-R respiratory domain score was greater for 
the ivacaftor group (7.56 points) than the placebo group (-0.83 points). The treatment difference for 
ivacaftor versus placebo was 8.39 points (95% CI: 2.17, 14.61; p value = 0.0091), which is 
approximately double the defined minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 4 points.  
As shown in Figure 8, the change seen in the CFQ-R respiratory domain score for the ivacaftor group 
during the Treatment Period reversed in the Follow-up Period when subjects were no longer on 
ivacaftor.

The PPS and CCS analyses were performed for the primary and secondary endpoints to provide 
supportive evidence for efficacy through Week 24. The results of the CCS analyses are presented in 
Table 15 and were consistent with the results of the FAS analysis in that no statistically significant 
differences were seen between treatment groups regarding the absolute change from baseline in 
ppFEV1.

Tertiary endpoints 
Change from baseline in non-respiratory domains of the CFQ-R 
The treatment differences favoured ivacaftor in the pooled analysis for the CFQ-R non-respiratory 
domains (treatment difference [95% CI]): physical (6.7224 [-1.0433, 14.4881]), emotion (5.4440 
[1.7232, 9.1649]), social (7.1716 [2.1042, 12.2390]), eating (4.6528 [0.1939, 9.1117]), and 
digestion (2.5616 [-1.7858, 6.9089]).  
Change from baseline in Weight 
Rate of change from baseline in weight through Week 24 was slightly greater for the ivacaftor group 
(1.8490 kg) than the placebo group (0.9214 kg). The mean treatment difference was 0.9275 kg (95% 
CI: -5.9659, 7.8210). 
For subjects 20 years of age or younger, weight-for-age z-scores were calculated using the CDC 
growth chart. The mean rate of change from baseline for weight-for-age z-score through Week 24 was 
slightly greater for the ivacaftor group (0.1829 points) than the placebo group (-0.0256 points). The 
mean treatment difference was 0.2085 points (95% CI: -0.4505, 0.8675).  
Change from baseline in Height 
The mean absolute change from baseline in height through Week 24 was slightly lower for the 
ivacaftor group (0.3699 cm) than the placebo group (1.7551 cm). The treatment difference was -
1.3851 cm (95% CI: -10.8213, 8.0510).

For subjects 20 years of age or younger, height-for-age z-scores were calculated using the CDC growth 
chart. The treatment difference between groups was 0.0794 cm (95% CI: -0.4803, 0.6391). 
CF-Related Complications 
No analysis of CF-related complications was performed because no episodes of pancreatitis or DIOS 
occurred during the study. 
Ancillary analyses 
The following pre-planned subgroups analyses were included in the SAP for the primary and secondary 
efficacy variables:  
-  Age Group at Baseline (6 to 11years [inclusive], 12 to 17 years [inclusive], and ≥ 18 years); 
- 
Percent Predicted FEV1 Severity at Baseline (<70%, 70% to 90% [inclusive], and >90% of the 
predicted value); 
-  Geographic Region (US and EU); 
-  Sex (Female and Male); 
- 
- 
Pseudomonas infection status at baseline (yes or no); 
Poly T status (5T, 7T, 9T). This subgroup analysis was only to take place if Poly T status relating to 
R117H allele can be obtained. 
In Study 110, following database lock, ad hoc analyses (e.g., by poly-T variant within each age 
category) were also carried out in the age subgroups ≥18 years old and 6 to 11 years old. These 
analyses were primarily focused on understanding any potential differences in results due to subject 
age, baseline percent predicted FEV1, and R117H allele poly-T variant.  
In this report only treatment differences for ivacaftor versus placebo by age group for the primary and 
secondary endpoints as well as by poly-T variant are shown. Other subgroup analyses have been 
addressed in EMEA/H/C/2494/II/027.  
Subjects ≥ 18 years old (26 on placebo; 24 on ivacaftor) 
Results of subgroup analyses limited to subjects aged ≥ 18 years are presented in Table 16.

The mean absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 24 by MMRM for subjects ≥18 years 
of age was greater for the ivacaftor group (4.51 percentage points) than the placebo group (-0.46 
percentage points). The treatment difference for ivacaftor versus placebo was 4.96 percentage points 
(95% CI: 1.15, 8.78; p value = 0.0119). 
In a responder analysis (see Table 17) of the mean absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 through 
Week 24, a higher number of patients in the ivacaftor group (n=24) than in the placebo group (n=26) 
experienced a change in ppFEV1 ≥3.5% (54.2% vs. 19.2%), ≥5% (54.2% vs. 15.4%), and ≥7.5% 
(33.3% vs. 3.8%).

Results of the analyses for other efficacy variables are presented in Table 18 (see below).   
Ad-hoc subgroup analyses were also performed for poly-T variant within each age category and should 
be interpreted with caution as this was not a pre-planned analysis and as it is an assessment of a 
subgrouping of a subgroup. 
In the Full Analysis Set of study 110, the LS mean absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 in 
subjects above 18 years of age with the confirmed 5T variant was 0.73 percentage points in the 
placebo group and 6.02 percentage points in the ivacaftor group. The treatment difference was 5.29 
percentage points (95% CI: 1.27, 9.32). In the group of subjects with the confirmed 7T variant, the 
treatment difference was 0.20 (95% CI: -8.14, 8.54). In the confirmed plus derived dataset of 
subjects with the R117H-5T, the treatment difference between groups was 3.20 percentage points 
(95% CI: -0.48, 6.87) in favour of ivacaftor while for subjects with the 7T variant, the treatment 
difference was -1.46 percentage points (95% CI: -8.69, 5.76).   
The analysis restricted to subjects ≥ 18 years by poly-T variant (confirmed plus derived dataset) 
shows a larger absolute change from baseline in the ivacaftor group both in subjects with the R117H-
7T variant (ivacaftor: 4.98 pp; placebo: 0.75 pp) and in those with the R117H-5T variant (ivacaftor:

7.42 pp; placebo: 0.78 pp). The response was larger in subjects with the R117H-5T variant than in 
subjects with the R117H-7T variant. In subjects with the 5T variant, the estimated (by MMRM) 
treatment difference for ivacaftor versus placebo at week 24 was 6.87 pp (95% CI: 2.19, 11.56).   
An MMRM analysis was conducted on the 10 subjects ≥18 years of age with R117H-7T which show a 
treatment difference at week 24 of -0.25 (95% CI: -14.16, 13.66). A waterfall plot analysis of 
individual subject responses at Week 24 suggests that some R117H-7T subjects did respond to 
ivacaftor treatment (see figures below).

Regarding sweat chloride, for patients with the 5T variant, the mean (SD) absolute change at week 24 
was -8.2 mmol/l (2.8) in the placebo group and -33.9 mmol/L (3.0) in the ivacaftor group. The 
estimated (by MMRM) treatment difference between groups was -25.64 mmol/l (95% CI: -33.86, -
17.42).  For patients with a 7T variant, the mean (SD) absolute change at week 24 was -11.7 mmol/l 
(11.9) and -19.3 mmol/l (6.9) in the placebo and ivacaftor groups, respectively.   
Assessment report

As for the respiratory domain score of the CFQ-R (pooled), for patients with the 5T variant, the mean 
(SE) absolute change at week 24 was -2.48 points (4.0) in the placebo group and 16.99 points (4.28) 
in the ivacaftor group. The estimated (by MMRM) treatment difference between groups was 19.47 
points (95% CI: 7.66, 31.27). For patients with a 7T variant, the mean (SD) absolute change at week 
24 was -5.56 points (10.14) and 11.11 points (19.77) in the placebo and ivacaftor groups respectively.   
Adolescents  
Only 2 subjects 12 to 17 years of age (inclusive) enrolled in the study, 1 subject randomized to 
ivacaftor and 1 subject randomized to placebo. No inferential statistical analysis was performed for this 
subgroup because the number of subjects with results in each treatment group was <5. 
One subject was a 13-year-old female with CFTR genotype R117H-7T/F508DEL-9T. At baseline, the 
subject had a percent predicted FEV1 of 87.633%, a sweat chloride value of 44.25 mmol/L, a BMI of 
28.04 kg/m2, and a CFQ-R respiratory domain score of 100 points. The subject was discontinued from 
the study 16 days after the first dose of ivacaftor due to non-compliance in completing the required 
ophthalmologic examination at Screening. The only Treatment Period visit that the subject had was the 
Week 2 Visit, at which there was no substantial change in percent predicted FEV1 (baseline 87.633%; 
Week 2: 88.232%), but the subject's sweat chloride showed a -17.25 mmol/L absolute change from 
baseline.  
The other subject was a 17-year-old female with CFTR genotype R117H-5T/W1282X-7T, who 
completed the full 24 weeks of treatment. At baseline, the subject had a percent predicted FEV1 of 
88.668%, a sweat chloride value of 74.75 mmol/L, a BMI of 21.86 kg/m2, and a CFQ-R respiratory 
domain score of 77.778 points. At the Week 24 Visit, the subject had a 7.534 percentage points 
absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline and a corresponding increase in CFQ-R 
respiratory domain score to 94.444 points. The subject’s sweat chloride value at the Week 24 Visit was 
slightly higher than at baseline. 
Children aged 6 to 11 years old (inclusive) 
Table 19 presents the mean absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 24 by MMRM for 
subjects 6 to 11 years of age. The mean absolute change (increase) in the placebo group was 
substantial, i.e. from 93.98 pp at baseline to 98.43 pp overall post-baseline, while the ivacaftor group 
had a slight decline in mean ppFEV1 from 97.49 pp at baseline to 96.25 pp overall post-baseline. The 
mean treatment difference estimated by MMRM for the absolute change from baseline was -6.33 
percentage points (95% CI: -11.96, -0.71; p value = 0.0301) favouring the placebo group.

The consistency of treatment effect over study visits for the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 
by MMRM for subjects 6 to 11 years of age (inclusive) is presented in Figure 13. The mean ppFEV1 was 
>93% for both treatment groups at all time points. While the mean ppFEV1 for the placebo group at 
baseline was 93.98 pp, the mean during the treatment period ranged from 97.36 (Week 2) to 99.10 pp 
(Week 8). The mean ppFEV1 for the ivacaftor group at baseline was 97.49 pp and ranged from 93.46 
pp (Week 2) to 99.01 pp (Week 8) during the treatment period.  
Figure 13 Modelled Absolute Change From Baseline in Percent Predicted FEV1 by Treatment: 
Full Analysis Set, Subjects 6 to 11 Years of Age (Inclusive) 
In view of the large placebo response and to further understand the treatment difference seen 
between the ivacaftor and placebo groups in subjects 6 to 11 years of age, the treatment effect over 
study visits for the absolute change from the Screening Visit in ppFEV1 was analysed to assess if any 
pre-treatment trends may have influenced the outcomes (see Figure 14). Comparison of the Screening 
and Day 1 (i.e. Baseline) values shows that in the placebo group, many subjects had a decrease in 
ppFEV1 between Screening and Baseline, and a number of ivacaftor subjects had an increase in 
ppFEV1 between Screening and Baseline. In the analysis of change from Screening value, there were 
no statistically significant (P value of <0.05) treatment difference in the absolute change in ppFEV1 at

any time point, including Overall Post-baseline. The MAH is of the opinion that the placebo group 
changes between the Screening Visit and Day 1 contributed to the observed treatment difference in 
the primary endpoint in subjects 6 to 11 years of age.

Figure 15 Study 110: Individual Subject Results for Absolute Change From Baseline in 
ppFEV1; FAS, Subjects 6 to 11 Years of Age
In the ivacaftor group, one subject had a serious decline in ppFEV1 at Week 16 (26 percentage points) 
that coincided with an SAE of pulmonary exacerbation; this subject remained on ivacaftor and had 
another substantial decline in FEV1 during the follow-up period (47 percentage points). The subject 
enrolled in the IVA arm of Study 112, and his FEV1 returned to baseline during IVA treatment in Study 
112. The next worse response in the 6- to 11-year-old subgroup in Study 110 was a subject who had a 
baseline ppFEV1 value of 105.5 pp and an average ppFEV1 value of 100.2 pp post-dose, ending at a 
ppFEV1 value of 103.2 pp at Week 24. Aside from these 2 subjects, all other 6- to 11-year-old subjects 
had less than a 5-percentage point relative change (comparing post-dose average to baseline), and 3 
subjects had average ppFEV1 values >100% during the 24-week treatment period.  
The LS mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride was -26.59 mmol/L for the ivacaftor 
group and 1.04 mmol/L for the placebo group. The treatment difference for ivacaftor versus placebo 
was -27.63 mmol/L (95% CI: -37.16, -18.10). This treatment difference favoured ivacaftor and was 
very similar to that of subjects ≥18 years of age (-21.87 mmol/L [95% CI: -26.46, -17.28]).  
Treatment differences were detected by Week 2 (first post-baseline time point assessed; -28.01 
mmol/L (95% CI: -40.29, -15.73) and were sustained through Week 24 (-26.35 mmol/L [95% CI: -
39.88, -12.83]. These treatment differences favoured ivacaftor and were very similar to those for 
subjects ≥18 years of age. 
No protocol-defined pulmonary exacerbations occurred in subjects 6 to 11 years of age (inclusive) 
during the treatment period. 
The mean absolute change from baseline in BMI-for-age z-score (calculated using the CDC growth 
chart for subjects who were 20 years of age or younger) at Week 24 by LMM was greater in the 
Assessment report

ivacaftor group (0.13 points) than in the placebo group (0.08 points). The mean treatment difference 
between groups was 0.05 points (95% CI: -0.69, 0.80). The mean treatment difference of the absolute 
change from baseline in BMI at Week 24 in children aged 6 to 11 years was -0.18 kg/m2 (95% CI: -
2.38, 2.01).  
Two versions of the CFQ-R questionnaire were used to collect data on subjects 6 to 11 years of age 
(inclusive) 1 in which the subject was interviewed (Children Ages 6 to 11 Years version) and 1 in which 
the subject's parent or caregiver was the respondent (Parent/Caregiver version). Only data collected 
from the Children Ages 6 to 11 Years questionnaire were used in efficacy analyses. 
The mean absolute change from baseline in the CFQ-R respiratory domain score through Week 24 by 
MMRM for subjects 6 to 11 years of age was -1.56 points in the placebo group and -7.69 points in the 
ivacaftor group. The treatment difference for ivacaftor versus placebo was -6.13 points (95% CI: -
15.68, 3.41), in favour of placebo.  
Little variation was seen in the CFQ-R respiratory domain scores for the placebo group during the 
Treatment Period, while the ivacaftor group experienced a substantial decrease in the mean CFQ-R 
respiratory domain scores at Week 2 and Week 16. For Weeks 4, 8, and 24, there were no clinically 
meaningful difference between the ivacaftor and placebo groups. The MAH is therefore of the opinion 
that caution is warranted in interpretation of the overall post-baseline differences. 
The following subjects in the ivacaftor group had substantial decreases in the CFQ-R respiratory 
domain score at the indicated week(s): one subject at Week 2 and Week 16, one subject at Week 2, 
one subject at Week 2 and Week 16, one subject at Week 2 and Week 16, and one Subject at Week 
16. All individual substantial decreases in the CFQ-R respiratory domain score occurred at Week 2 and 
Week 16. Some of these subjects with notable changes in CFQ-R also had notable variability in FEV1. 
Complete efficacy and safety narratives for these subjects, and all subjects <18 years of age, have 
been provided.

Overall, no evidence of a spirometry and of a CFQ-R respiratory domain response to ivacaftor therapy 
was seen in subjects from this age group with either of the R117H poly-T variants. The MAH is of the 
view that this decrease in ppFEV1 in the IVA group may be partially explained by a subject with a 
pulmonary exacerbation and by the changes between the Screening Visit and baseline (Day 1). 
Summary statistics revealed clear and consistent sweat chloride responses for both R117H poly-T 
variant subgroups which began at Week 2 and were sustained through Week 24.

Primary Analysis 
Full analysis set: all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of 
study drug (i.e., ivacaftor or placebo). Patients were analyzed according to 
the study drug to which they were assigned at/through Week 24.  
Eight patients did not complete 24 weeks of treatment because the study 
was terminated early by the sponsor. For these 8 subjects, the last 
Treatment Period study visit was: Week 2 for 2 subjects, Week 4 for 1 
subject, Week 8 for 3 subjects, and Week 16 for 2 subjects. Out of the 8 
patients who did not complete 24 weeks of treatment 3 were children and 5 
adult patients.

A number of tertiary endpoints, additional spirometry variables, subgroup 
analyses and post-hoc analyses have also been performed.  
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
No pre-specified efficacy analyses have been performed across trials. However, baseline data and 
disease characteristics of patients enrolled in study 110 have been compared to those of patients 
enrolled in studies 102 (adult and adolescent patients with a G551D mutation), 103 (patients aged 6 to 
11 years with a G551D mutation) and study 111 (patients aged 6 years and older with a non-G551D-
CFTR gating mutation). It is concluded that consistently with the milder phenotype associated to the 
R117H-CFTR mutation patients in study 110 had lower mean sweat chloride concentrations 
(approximately 70 mmol/L) than subjects from studies 102, 103, and 111 (approximately 100 
mmol/L). The recruited R117H subjects had well preserved BMIs (mean: 23.76 kg/m2) and a higher 
proportion were pancreatic sufficient (as assessed by a low rate of pancreatic enzyme replacement 
therapy use [pancreatin: 11.6%; pancrelipase: 5.8%] and a high rate of faecal elastase-1 ≥200 µg/g 
[87.0%]) compared to the subject populations of studies 102 and 103.  
Regarding ppFEV1 study 110 patients who were 6 to 11 years of age had a baseline mean ppFEV1 
approximately 10 percentage points higher than study 103 patients and a categorical distribution 
favouring higher baseline ppFEV1 values. The high preservation of lung function in Study 110 subjects 
6 to 11 years of age is not unexpected given the known clinical progression of CF in patients with an 
R117H-CFTR mutation; that is, patients with an R117H-CFTR mutation have less advanced disease in 
childhood and adolescence than patients of the same age with more severe genotypes.  
The results of these studies have been discussed to provide further supportive information for the 
efficacy shown in study 110. In studies 102, 103, and 111 (Part 1) analysis of the primary endpoint 
(absolute change in ppFEV1) performed in patients with other mutations than R117H showed a 
substantial treatment effect in favour of ivacaftor that was statistically significant. Treatment 
differences in mean absolute change from baseline through week 24 in ppFEV1 were in all cases above 
Assessment report  
EMA/297262/2020  
Page 53/119 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10.0 percentage points. In particular, in study 103 the treatment difference was 12.5 percentage 
points.  
Although in Study 110, subjects 6 to 11 years of age (inclusive) showed a comparable sweat chloride 
response to those ≥18 years of age, the younger age group did not show any other meaningful clinical 
response to ivacaftor treatment. In this age group, the ppFEV1 treatment difference favoured placebo. 
Therefore, the extension of indication was refused during procedure EMEA/H/C/002494/II/27. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
The results of studies 110 and 112 have been discussed elsewhere in this report; both studies included 
paediatric population. 
Narratives have been provided for two patients ≥65 years old enrolled in study 110. Both of them were 
randomised to placebo. One of them experienced adverse events of cough, sputum increased and 
pyrexia that are reported as not related and of moderate severity. They were considered as non-
serious adverse events in study 112. A moderate increase in ppFEV1 was seen for both patients after 
twelve and two weeks of treatment with ivacaftor in study 112. Regarding sweat chloride, no change 
was seen in one of these patients while for the other a decrease of 30 mmol/l was seen at week 2 of 
study 112. 
The overall median age in study 110 was 32 years while it was 23 years in study 111 (non-G551D 
gating mutations) and 24 years in study 102 (G551D-CFTR mutation). The maximum age reported in 
these studies is 68, 57 and 53 years respectively. The MAH was requested to provide the number of 
patients ≥55 years old treated with ivacaftor in studies 110, 111 and 102 and the corresponding roll-
over studies. A total of 10 patients ≥55 years of age were treated with ivacaftor, of which 5 subjects 
turned 55 during ivacaftor treatment. In addition, 4 subjects from study 113 were ≥55 years of age 
during either study 113 (a pilot study testing the effect of ivacaftor on lung function in subjects with CF 
and residual CFTR function) or the rollover study 112.  
Overall, CHMP considered that the number of patients treated with ivacaftor who are at least 55 years 
old is still limited.      
Supportive studies 
Study VX12-770-112: Phase 3, multicentre, 2-arm, open-label, rollover study of orally 
administered ivacaftor in subjects with CF who were 6 years of age and older, had a non-
G551D-CFTR mutation, and who had previously been enrolled in Study VX11-770-110 (Study 
110), Study VX12-770-111 (Study 111), or Study VX12-770-113 (Study 113). 
Methods 
Study 112 was an open-label study designed to evaluate the long-term safety, efficacy, and 
pharmacokinetic of ivacaftor in subjects from Study 110 (subjects with an R117H-CFTR mutation), 
study 111 (subjects with a non-G551D-CFTR gating mutation that causes a severe gating defect) and 
study 113 (subjects who have phenotypic or molecular evidence of residual CFTR function). The final 
report of study 112 was assessed within procedure EMEA/H/C/002494/II/0054 in 2017.   
A schematic of the study 112 design is provided in Figure 16.

Figure 16 Schematic of Study Design 
At the time of the initial application of the extension of the indication to subjects with CF aged 6 years 
and older with an R117H-CFTR mutation (EMEA/H/C/002494/II/27), results from interim analysis 
(through Week 12 Visit) of data from patients who were previously enrolled in study 110 was provided. 
Patients from study 111 and study 113 who enrolled in study 112 were not included in this interim 
analysis. Although in study 110 subjects 6 to 11 years of age did not show any meaningful clinical 
response to ivacaftor treatment except for sweat chloride response, they were enrolled in study 112. 
Consequently, this interim analysis provides additional information.  
Baseline was defined as the most recent measurement before intake of the first dose of study drug in 
Study 112. This measurement was generally taken at the Day 1 Visit for Study 112, which was also 
the Follow-up Visit of Study 110, and which occurred 3 to 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug in 
Study 110. For study 110 patients who enrolled in the ivacaftor arm of study 112, the Safety Follow-up 
Visit for study 110 was used as the Baseline Visit for study 112.  
In the following, patients from the ivacaftor group in study 110 are referred to as patients in the 
ivacaftor/ivacaftor group (i.e. patients who received ivacaftor in study 110 and in study 112), and 
patients from the placebo group in study 110 will be referred to as patients in the placebo/ivacaftor 
group (i.e. patients who received placebo in study 110 and ivacaftor in study 112). 
Of the 69 patients enrolled in study 110, 65 enrolled in the ivacaftor arm of study 112, 2 enrolled in an 
observational arm of study 112 and 2 did not enrol in study 112 due to early discontinuation of 
treatment in study 110. The Full Analysis Set (FAS) for this interim analysis includes 65 patients: 30 
patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group and 35 patients in the placebo/ivacaftor group. Out of these, 
64 patients completed at least 12 weeks of treatment in Study 112. A patient in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor 
group discontinued between Week 2 and 12 and three other patients (1 placebo/ivacaftor and 2 
ivacaftor/ivacaftor) discontinued after Week 12.  
Fifteen patients 6 to 11 years of age at the start of study 110 enrolled in study 112 (placebo/ivacaftor: 
8 patients; ivacaftor/ivacaftor: 7 subjects). Their overall baseline mean ppFEV1 was 92.1% (97.5% in 
the placebo/ivacaftor group and 85.8% in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group). Percent predicted FEV1 
baseline in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group was lower than that of study 110 (97.5%). This difference was 
likely due to a patient who suffered a large decrease in ppFEV1 during study 110 due to a pulmonary 
exacerbation. This subject remained on ivacaftor throughout the pulmonary exacerbation and his FEV1 
returned to baseline during study 112. In study 112, the baseline sweat chloride concentration was 
62.8 mmol/L in the placebo/ivacaftor group and 60.4 mmol/L in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group.  
Summary statistics were the pre-planned analysis for the overall population, patients aged ≥18 years, 
and patients aged 6 to 11 years. Following database lock additional analyses were conducted to 
evaluate the absolute change from baseline to Week 12 in ppFEV1 using a one-sample t-test.

Outcomes 
Interim analysis through the Week 12 Visit of study 112 results previously described in variation 
(EMEA/H/C/002494/II/27) 
Full Analysis Set, all patients (n=65) 
Summary statistics show that the mean (SD) absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline at week 12 in 
the placebo/ivacaftor group was 5.00 percentage points (7.67) and 6.04 percentage points (10.42) in 
the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group (n=27 from the initial number of 30 at baseline). For the overall 
population, the mean (SD) change from baseline in ppFEV1 at week 12 was 5.45 percentage points 
(8.91).  
Full Analysis Set, Patients ≥18 Years of Age (n=49) 
Summary statistics show that the mean (SD) absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline at week 12 in 
the placebo/ivacaftor group was 5.47 (7.89) percentage points and 4.73 (6.39) percentage points in 
the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group (n=20 from the initial number of 23 at baseline). The mean (SD) overall 
absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline to Week 12 in study 112 was 5.15 percentage points (7.21)  
Full Analysis Set, Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age  
Only 1 patient in this age group was enrolled in the placebo/ivacaftor group, a 17-year-old White 
female with R117H-5T/W1282X-7T. At study 110 baseline his ppFEV1 and sweat chloride were 88.67% 
and 74.75 mmol/l. At study 112 baseline, these figures were as follows: 96.477% and 82 mmol/l, i.e. 
she had experienced an increase of 7.5% and 7.3 mmol/l in ppFEV1 and sweat chloride respectively. 
At study 112 week 12 his ppFEV1 was 100.59 (above the baseline of study 110 and study 112). At 
week 2 his sweat chloride was 44.5 mmol/l, i.e. a large reduction was observed with respect to 
baseline values of studies 110 and 112. 
Full Analysis Set, Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age (n=15) 
The mean (SD) absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline at week 12 in the placebo/ivacaftor group 
was 3.58 (7.76) percentage points and 9.78 (17.87) percentage points in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group. 
There was a slight decrease in ppFEV1 in the placebo/ivacaftor group at week 2 in study 112. Although 
the decrease is numerically very small, similar phenomenon was observed by the analysis of the 
youngest subgroup in study 110 that was attributed to unlucky pre-treatment trends in study 110. No 
further issues were raised given the limited magnitude of the drop. The mean (SD) overall absolute 
change in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline to Week 12 in study 112 was 6.47 percentage points 
(13.31).  
Overall, the results seen in study 112 in terms of change from baseline at week 12 in ppFEV1 in the 
placebo/ivacaftor group improve the results seen in study 110 in patients receiving ivacaftor (for which 
the mean absolute change from baseline was 2.57 as compared to 5.00 percentage points in the 
placebo/ivacaftor group of study 112, FAS population, all patients). This seems also to be the case of 
patients in the age group ≥18 years old and particularly in those aged 6 to 11 years old. With a single 
exception (patients aged 18 years and older) the change (increase) at week 12 in ppFEV1 is higher in 
the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group than in the placebo/ivacaftor group. The results of the post-hoc statistical 
analyses performed show treatment differences between groups in ppFEV1 that are (nominally) 
statistically significant except for patients in the 6 to 11-year-old group. This was attributed by the 
MAH to a single patient in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group who had an increase of 49.72 percentage 
points at week 12 following resolution of a pulmonary exacerbation.

In study 110, 17 children were enrolled (8 patients on placebo; 9 on ivacaftor). The mean absolute 
change (increase) in the placebo group in ppFEV1 was substantial, i.e. from 93.98 pp at baseline to 
98.43 pp overall post-baseline, while the ivacaftor group had a slight decline in mean pp FEV1 from 
97.49 pp at baseline to 96.25 pp overall post-baseline. The mean treatment difference for the absolute 
change from baseline was -6.33 percentage points (95% CI: -11.96, -0.71) favouring the placebo 
group. 
Thirteen children rolled over from study 110 into study 112. Their mean (SD) baseline ppFEV1 was 
90.7 (18.8) percentage points.  
At study 112 week 104, children from study 110 (n=4) experienced a mean (SD) absolute change in 
ppFEV1 of 8.2 percentage points (23.8) which is in contrast with the value observed in study 110. 
However, at all study 112 visits the range of values of absolute change in ppFEV1 includes a negative 
minimum value (ranging from -3.1 to -10.9). At earlier points in time where the number of children 
with available data was higher (e.g., n=10 at week 48), the mean (SD) absolute change in ppFEV1 
from study 112 baseline was 4.2 percentage points (8.1).  
Similarly, a response in the respiratory domain of CFQ-R was observed at almost all time points in 
study 112. At baseline, mean (SD) respiratory domain score was 82.1 (20.4) points. Changes from 
baseline in the 6 to 11 years of age subgroup remained above the MCID at all but 1 time point (i.e., at 
Week 36) and ranged from 3.2 to 10.1 points.   
For the two adolescents who rolled over into study 112 from study 110, at week 84 (last visit at which 
data were available), the mean (SD) change from baseline in ppFEV1 was 5.8 (4.8) percentage points. 
At the earlier termination visit (i.e., as soon as possible after the last ivacaftor dose), this value was 
2.6 (6.4) percentage points.  
Study VX15-770-122: A study in US cystic fibrosis patients with the R117H-CFTR mutation 
to confirm the long-term safety and effectiveness of Kalydeco, including patients <18 years 
of age, combining data captured in the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry from an 
interventional cohort and a non-interventional cohort 
The MAH was requested by FDA to conduct an open-label, single-arm study as a post-marketing 
requirement to evaluate the long-term safety of Kalydeco in CF paediatric patients following approval 
of Kalydeco for CF aged 6 years and older who have the R117H mutation in the CFTR gene. Study 
VX15-770-122 (study 122) was designed as an observational, phase 4 study using data collected via 
the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR).  
The schedule of reporting of data from this study is detailed below:

Table 22 Schedule for Interim Analyses and Report Submission Dates 
In this application, interim analysis 1 (IA1) was submitted and interim analysis 2 (IA2) was provided 
upon request from CHMP during the procedure. Outcome measures summarised in this assessment 
report are those of the IA2, unless stated otherwise.    
Methods 
Study 122 is an ongoing Phase 4, non-interventional, observational study to confirm the long-term 
effectiveness and safety of Kalydeco in CF patients who have the R117H mutation. The study leverages 
existing data collected via the CFFPR. Observational cohorts of patients receiving Kalydeco and 
historical patients who were never treated with Kalydeco were established in the registry as described 
below.  
A Non-Interventional Kalydeco Cohort (hereafter referred to as “Kalydeco Cohort”) is comprised of 
paediatric (<18 years of age) and adult R117H patients who were included in the CFFPR and had a 
record of Kalydeco treatment initiation from 01 January 2015 through 31 December 2016. Analyses of 
data for 36 months before and 36 months after the initiation of Kalydeco treatment will permit a 
within-group comparison of outcome measures of effectiveness and safety before and after treatment.  
A Historical Cohort is comprised of longitudinal data from an earlier time period (i.e. 2009 through 
2011) for paediatric (<18 years of age) and adult patients with the R117H mutation who had never 
been exposed to Kalydeco and will provide additional context.  
A schematic of the study design for Non-Interventional Cohort is provided in Figure 17.

Study participants  
The inclusion criteria for each study cohort are summarized in Table 23.   
Table 23 Study Cohort Inclusion Criteria 
Each patient in the Kalydeco cohort was attempted to be matched with at least 1 corresponding patient 
from the Historical cohort but the specified matching algorithm did not successfully achieve balance in 
ppFEV1 in the adult populations. Therefore, patients in the Historical cohort were not matched to those 
in the Kalydeco cohort.  
In the final study protocol, an Interventional Cohort was planned as part of the post-marketing 
requirement to ensure adequate paediatric enrolment (i.e., a minimum of 50 patients ≥8 to <18 years 
of age with evaluable data on key endpoints). However, as it became clear that this target had been 
achieved in the Non-Interventional Cohort, the Interventional Cohort was closed and no patients were 
enrolled.

Objectives 
Primary Objective: confirm the long-term safety and effectiveness of Kalydeco in US CF patients with 
the R117H-CFTR mutation who are <18 years of age. 
Secondary Objective: describe the long-term safety and effectiveness of Kalydeco in CF patients with 
the R117H-CFTR mutation overall and in patients ≥18 years of age. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The outcomes captured in the CFFPR and assessed as study endpoints include: 
- 
- 
Lung function measurements (ppFEV1 and ppFVC) using the Global Lung Initiative (GLI) standards. 
Pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) (which, by definition, include the use of intravenous antibiotics at 
home or in the hospital), use of intravenous antibiotics. 
-  Nutritional parameters (weight, body mass index [BMI], and associated z-scores). 
-  Deaths or transplantation. 
-  Hospitalizations. 
-  Selected CF complications (symptomatic sinus disease, pulmonary complications, CF-related 
diabetes [CFRD], distal intestinal obstruction syndrome [DIOS], hepatobiliary complications, and 
pancreatitis). 
-  Selected pulmonary microorganisms (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa [P aeruginosa], 
Staphylococcus aureus [S aureus]). 
Study Size 
No prespecified sample size calculation was made. The sample size was dependent on the use of 
Kalydeco in the real-world setting. The study intent was to evaluate a minimum of 50 patients who 
were ≥8 to <18 years of age, had at least 2 years of acceptable spirometry data in the CFFPR, and had 
attended at least 2 of the CFF quarterly recommended scheduled CF clinic visits per year. The 
minimum number of adult patients in the Kalydeco cohort was intended to be 100. There was no 
maximum number for either paediatric or adult patient groups, although, if the above criteria were 
met, further enrolment would be targeted to stop on 31 December 2016. 
Statistical methods  
Two Statistical Analyses Plans (SAP) were submitted, i.e., for the IA1 (version 1.0 of 20 FEB 2017) and 
for the IA2 and final analysis (version 1.0 of 20 February 2019). The final analysis is due by 31 
December 2020. Data below correspond to the SAP of IA2 in which modifications from the IA1 SAP 
were made to accommodate the data available.  
The mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis and linear mixed effects (LME) 
analyses of spirometry endpoints and the LME analyses of nutritional parameters described in the 
study protocol as potential analyses to be performed if warranted by the data were not performed for 
none of the interim analyses and there is no plan to perform this kind of analyses in the final report.  
For the purpose of analysis of the outcome measures, two periods were defined for this study based on 
timing relative to the start of Kalydeco treatment (defined as the index date): 
- 
Period 1 (pre-treatment) is defined as the 36-month period before the index date. 
Assessment report  
EMA/297262/2020  
Page 60/119 
 
 
 
- 
Period 2 (post-treatment) is defined as the index date through the end of the study, i.e. through 
the 36 months after the index date. For IA2, this was limited to the first 24 months of post-
treatment data for all Kalydeco Cohort patients, and up to 36 months of post-treatment outcomes 
data for patients who initiated Kalydeco in 2015. 
For patients for whom the precise start of Kalydeco dosing was not known, the visit at which the first 
use of Kalydeco was indicated was considered the index date. 
For the purposes of change from baseline analyses of lung function and nutritional parameters, 
baseline was defined as the last encounter visit up to 31 days before the date of first initiation of 
Kalydeco. For patients for whom the precise start of Kalydeco dosing was not known, baseline was 
defined as the last encounter before the visit at which the use of Kalydeco was indicated for the first 
time. 
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics included age, age at diagnosis, sex, race, weight, 
weight-for-age z-score, height, height-for-age z-score, BMI, BMI-for-age z-score, pulmonary function 
(ppFEV1 as both a continuous and categorical variable [<70, ≥70 to ≤90, and >90]), ppFVC and poly-
T status (as captured in the registry). These characteristics are summarized separately for each age 
group within the Kalydeco Cohort as of the index date. Baseline demographic and clinical 
characteristics for the Historical Cohort are summarized by age group as of 01 January 2009. 
Exposure data are summarized separately for each age group. Exposure to Kalydeco (duration of 
treatment in months) is summarized by means of descriptive summary statistics and also categorically 
(<6 months, ≥6 to <12 months, ≥12 months to <24 months, and ≥24 months to <36 months). 
Changes in exposure after Kalydeco initiation (treatment discontinuation, death, or loss to follow-up) 
are also summarized as number (%) of patients. Treatment discontinuations are defined as having no 
record of Kalydeco use recorded at a later date and before the end of the study. 
Visit frequency is described by the proportions of patients in each age group having <2, ≥2 to <4, and 
≥4 clinic visits per year, as well as the mean annual number of visits as recorded in the registry. 
Lung function data are summarized using descriptive statistics for the observed values at the index 
date and for each 12-month interval in the pre- and post-treatment periods. Where more than one 
value was available in any given 12-month interval, the average of the values was used. Analysis 
Comparing Post-Treatment Data with Historical Cohort Data: ppFEV1 observed data for the ≥6 to <18 
Years of Age analysis set, and the corresponding subset from the Historical Cohort, will be summarized 
and compared using descriptive statistics. Plots will be provided as appropriate to aid in the 
interpretation of data. 
All summary statistics and descriptive statistics provided for the ppFEV1 endpoint are repeated for 
ppFVC. No inferential statistics will be provided for ppFVC. 
The number and percentage of patients with PEx and PEx requiring hospitalization are summarized for 
each 12-month interval in the pre- and post-treatment periods. Percentages of patients with PEx and 
PEx requiring hospitalization are compared between the 12-month interval in the period immediately 
preceding the start of Kalydeco treatment and the 12-month intervals after treatment initiation using a 
McNemar’s test. A Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test for paired data was used to compare the number of PEx 
and PEx requiring hospitalization between the 12-month interval in the period immediately preceding 
the start of Kalydeco treatment and the first 12-month intervals after treatment initiation. 
Analyses of hospitalizations and CF disease-related hospitalizations are carried out in a similar way to 
analyses of PEx. 
Assessment report  
EMA/297262/2020  
Page 61/119 
 
 
 
Descriptive statistics on observed values of weight, weight-for-age z-scores, height, height-for-age z-
scores, BMI, and BMI-for-age z-scores at the index date and for each 12-month interval in the pre- 
and post-treatment periods are provided. For IA2, not all subjects have reached the final 12-month 
interval; data for all available subjects in that interval are presented. Changes from baseline at each 
12-month interval are also summarized descriptively. Z-scores are calculated using the CDC growth 
charts which are designed for use only in subjects aged 2 to 20 years of age. Further details are 
described in the SAP.  
Deaths and transplantations are summarized for relevant analysis sets and by cohort. This analysis 
was only presented for the Kalydeco Cohort but not for the Historical Cohort. 
The prevalence of the selected complications is presented for each 12-month interval in the pre- and 
post-treatment periods.  
The number and percentage of patients with a culture positive for bacteria, including positive for P 
aeruginosa, and patients with cultures positive for bacteria other than P. aeruginosa are summarized 
for each 12-month interval in the pre- and post-treatment periods for those patients who had a 
microbiology culture result. 
The evaluation of safety is a co-primary objective of study 122. Certain effectiveness analyses, 
including absolute change in ppFEV1 and PEx, will also be used to support the overall safety objective 
of the study. In accordance with its observational nature, no additional safety reporting is applicable 
for the Kalydeco Cohort. 
The following ad hoc analyses were performed as part of IA1. Both analyses were applicable only to 
the Kalydeco Cohort (and not to the Historical Cohort). 
-  Visit frequency was assessed in the year before Kalydeco treatment initiation. 
-  Data on the following parameters were assessed in the subset of patients who had data available 
in all time intervals: ppFEV1, PEx (overall and those requiring hospitalization), weight, weight-for-
age z-score, BMI, BMI-for-age z-score, hospitalizations, prevalence of selected complications, and 
positive microbiology culture results.  
Analysis Sets 
The following analysis sets were defined within the overall Kalydeco Cohort by age at the time of 
Kalydeco initiation: 
-  All Patients Set (will comprise all patients who received at least 1 dose of Kalydeco) 
-  ≥18 Years of Age (named the Adult Analysis Set in the protocol) 
-  ≥6 to <18 Years of Age (named the Primary Full Analysis Set in the protocol, and focus of the 
primary analyses to fulfil the primary objective of this study) 
-  ≥2 to <6 Years of Age 
Similar analyses sets were defined within the Historical Cohort by age as of 01 January 2009.

Participants flow 
Kalydeco cohort 
There were 368 R117H patients with a record of Kalydeco initiation between 01 January 2015 and 31 
December 2016.  
The table below present patients included per age category as of December 2016, December 2017 and 
December 2018. (Table 24).

Baseline data 
Paediatric subjects 
Table 25 summarizes key baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of paediatric Kalydeco 
Cohort patients by age subgroup as provided in the IA1. The exact number of paediatric subjects does 
not exactly coincide with that of IA2 (i.e., 107 paediatric patients aged ≥ 6 to less than 18 years of 
age and 65 patients ≥ 2 to less than 6 years) in which no baseline data were discussed with a few 
exceptions.

Table 25 Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of Paediatric Patients at Kalydeco 
Initiation (Interim Analysis 1) 
Mean BMI-for-age z-score in patients ≥6 to <18 years of age (0.5) and patients ≥2 to <6 years of age 
(0.5) were considered normal, which is not unexpected for this residual function CF patient population. 
Similarly, ppFEV1 in patients ≥6 to <18 years of age was well preserved at baseline (mean [SD] = 
99.3 [13.7]). Most patients had unknown poly-T status, precluding any subgroup analyses being 
conducted by this characteristic. 
Table 26 summarise ivacaftor exposure data in paediatric patients of the Kalydeco cohort. Among 
paediatric patients ≥6 to <18 years of age, the mean (SD) duration of Kalydeco exposure was 27.30 
(9.95) months; the majority (77.6%) had at least 24 months of exposure; 17.8% had a record of 
Kalydeco discontinuation. In the 12 months immediately preceding Kalydeco treatment initiation, 
patients ≥6 to <18 years of age had an average of 3.7 visits per year and 49.5% of patients had ≥4 
visits per year; in the second year after Kalydeco initiation, 36 patients (41.4%) had ≥2 to <4 visits 
and 48 (55.2%) had ≥ 4 visits per year.  
Similarly, among paediatric patients ≥2 to <6 years of age, the majority (83%) had at least 24 
months of Kalydeco exposure with only 8 (12.3%) patients having a record of treatment 
discontinuation. In the 12 months immediately preceding treatment initiation, patients ≥2 to <6 years 
of age had an average of 4.0 visits per year and 60.9% of patients had ≥4 visits per year; in the 
second year after Kalydeco initiation, 25 patients (43.9%) had ≥2 to <4 visits and 32 (56.1%) had ≥ 4 
visits per year.

Patients in the Kalydeco Cohort were followed from their first record of Kalydeco treatment in the 
CFFPR until they discontinue Kalydeco treatment (i.e. no record of Kalydeco use in the registry), die, or 
are lost to follow-up, whichever occurs first. Among paediatric patients aged ≥6 to less than 18 years, 
17.8% had a record of treatment discontinuation, a patient had a record of therapy with other CFTR 
modulator, and 4 were lost to follow-up. These figures for children aged ≥2 to less than 6 years were 
12.3%, 1.5%, 4.6%. In addition, a patient in this age group died.

Adult subjects 
Key baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of adult Kalydeco Cohort patients and the overall 
Kalydeco-treated population as provided in the IA1 are summarised in table below.

Table 27 Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of Adult Patients and Overall Population 
at Kalydeco Initiation  
Among adult patients in the Kalydeco Cohort, mean BMI (kg/m2) at baseline was 26.5 kg/m2, slightly 
above the World Health Organization’s (WHO) threshold of 25 kg/m2 for normal weight. In the overall 
Kalydeco Cohort, mean BMI (kg/m2) at baseline was 22.7 kg/m2, which was well within the WHO 
normal weight range; this is not unexpected for this patient population with residual CFTR function. 
At baseline, the mean (SD) ppFEV1 in adults was 70.8 (24.6) percentage points, which was lower than 
the baseline ppFEV1 observed in paediatric patients and consistent with the progressive nature of CF 
disease. Lung function in the overall Kalydeco Cohort with non-missing values at baseline was similar 
to that observed for adults, with a mean (SD) ppFEV1 of 80.7 (25.3) pp. 
The mean (SD) duration of Kalydeco exposure in adult patients was 20.25 (11.79) months. The 
majority (52%) of adult patients had at least 24 months of Kalydeco exposure. Among adult patients, 
there were 24.5% (48 patients) with a record of ivacaftor discontinuation in the registry, 2.6% (5 
patients) had a record of other modulator therapy, 22.4% (44 patients) were lost to follow-up, and 
1.0% (2 patients) die.  
In the 12 months immediately before Kalydeco treatment initiation, adult patients had an average of 
3.3 visits per year with 35.3% having 4 or more visits per year; in the second year after Kalydeco 
initiation, 50 patients (40.7%) had ≥2 to <4 visits and 53 (43.1%) had ≥ 4 visits per year.

Historical cohort 
At the start of data collection in January 1, 2009 there were 509 (as compared to 518 reported in the 
Interim Analysis 1) Kalydeco-naïve patients with an R117H mutation in the (unmatched) Historical 
Cohort, including 282 adult and 227 paediatric patients, of whom 128 were ≥6 to <18 years of age. 
Table 28 summarizes key demographic and clinical characteristics of the unmatched Historical Cohort 
patients overall and by age subgroup as provided in the Interim Analysis 1 (note the slight difference 
in the number of patients).

At the beginning of follow-up (i.e., 2009) for paediatric Historical Cohort patients, mean BMI-for-age z-
scores in patients ≥6 to <18 and ≥2 to <6 years of age were within 0.5 SD of the referent CDC 
population, indicating normal BMI in these patients. Lung function was well preserved at the beginning 
of follow-up among patients ≥6 to <18 years; the mean (SD) ppFEV1 was 96.2 (12.5) percentage 
points. 
The mean BMI in both adults and in the overall Historical Cohort population were normal. Mean ppFEV1 
was 74.2% in adults and 82.7% in the overall population. 
In the Paediatric Historical Cohort patients ≥6 to <18 years of age had a mean (SD) of 3.4 (2.1) clinic 
visits per year; only 34.3% of patients in this age group had the recommended ≥4 clinic visits per 
year. Similarly, Historical Cohort patients ≥2 to <6 years of age had a mean (SD) of 3.5 (2.0) visits 
per year, and only 36.1% of patients in this younger age group had an average of ≥4 visits per year. 
Adult patients in the Historical Cohort had a mean (SD) of 3.3 (2.3) clinic visits per year with only 
25.8% having the recommended number of yearly visits (i.e., quarterly). In the overall population, 
patients had a mean (SD) of 3.4 (2.2) visits per year, and only 29.9% had the recommended number 
of yearly clinic visits. 
Table 29 shows the demographic and disease characteristics of paediatric patients in the Kalydeco 
cohort at the index date (i.e., at the time of treatment initiation) and Table 30 shows data in the 
matched Historical cohort at the beginning of the follow-up period in January 2009. The matched 
historical cohort consisted of patients with CF, with at least 1 allele of the R117H-CFTR mutation, in 
the CFF Patient Registry as of 01 January 2009, with no evidence of any prior Kalydeco exposure, 
matched to Kalydeco Cohort patients on age, gender, and lung function.

ppFEV1 results 
Patients ≥6 to <18 years: 
Figure 18 summarizes ppFEV1 over time in Kalydeco-treated paediatric patients ≥6 to <18 years of 
age. Among patients ≥6 to <18 years of age, 92 (out of the 107 in the cohort) had non-missing 
ppFEV1 data available in the year preceding treatment with Kalydeco. In the second-year post-
treatment, ppFEV1 values were available for 87 children.  
In the 36 months before Kalydeco initiation, ppFEV1 was relatively stable with a mean of 98.2 
percentage points in the 12 months immediately before treatment initiation. In the 36 months 
following Kalydeco treatment initiation, mean ppFEV1 increased slightly and remained above the pre-
treatment baseline.

Figure 18 Kalydeco Cohort Patients ≥6 to <18 Years of Age: Change in ppFEV1 Over Time, 
36 Months Before and 36 Months After Kalydeco Treatment Initiation (Interim Analysis 2) 
Mean ppFEV1 (percentage points) numerically increased from pre-treatment baseline during the first 
12 months of Kalydeco treatment (mean [SD]:1.1 [7.2]; this increase was maintained in the second 
(mean [SD]: 0.5 [9.1]), and third (mean [SD]: 1.0 [9.1]) 12-month intervals after treatment 
initiation, among patients who had available data in the respective intervals.   
Adult patients: 
In adult subjects (n=196), in the 36 months before Kalydeco treatment initiation, ppFEV1 was 
relatively stable with a mean (SD) of 69.2 (23.7) percentage points in the 12 months immediately 
before treatment initiation (n=170). Following Kalydeco treatment, ppFEV1 slightly increased to 71.9 
(23.5) in the first year post-treatment (n=188), to 72.2 (23.2) pp in the second year (n=120), and to 
71.3 (23.5) percentage points in the third year post-treatment initiation (n=95). The mean (SD) 
absolute change from the index date to the >12 to 24-month interval post treatment initiation was 2.3 
(9.7) percentage points based on data from 109 adult subjects. 
Ad-hoc analysis with non-missing ppFEV1 data in paediatric patients aged ≥ 6 years to less than 18 
years:  
Within the IA1 (05 December 2017), the MAH presented the results of an ad-hoc analysis which was 
confined to subjects in the Kalydeco cohort with non-missing ppFEV1 data in all three pre-treatment 
intervals and first year post-treatment interval. Among the 71 (out of 109) paediatric patients aged ≥ 
6 years to less than 18 years, the mean (SD) ppFEV1 was 97.0 (12.1) pp in the year preceding 
treatment initiation. In the 12 months after treatment initiation, the mean ppFEV1 increased to 99.6 
(12.6) pp. Among the 110 (out of 196) adult subjects with non-missing data, mean (SD) ppFEV1 in the 
year preceding treatment with Kalydeco was 66.7 (24.4) pp which increased to 68.1 (23.8) pp in the 
year following treatment initiation.

ppFVC results 
Patients ≥6 to <18 years:  
In terms of percent predicted Forced Vital Capacity (ppFVC), in patients ≥6 to <18 years of age with 
data available in the 12-month interval preceding treatment initiation (92 out of the 107) the mean 
(SD) ppFVC was 101.7 (11.9) pp. In the second-year post-treatment this value was 102.3 (12.7) 
(n=87). The mean (SD) absolute change from the index date value (102.57 pp, n=91) to the first 12-
month interval post-treatment was 0.96 (5.7) pp. The change from the index date to the second 12-
month interval post-treatment (n=80) was 0.01 (7.1) pp. For the 75 patients with data available, the 
change from the index date to the third 12-month interval post-treatment was 1.01 (9.10) pp.  
Adult patients:  
In the group of adult subjects, the mean (SD) absolute change in ppFVC from the value at the index 
date (82.14 [19.83], n=149 out of the 196 in this age group) to the first (n=149), second (n=109) 
and third (n=86) year post-treatment was 1.2 (7.9), 1.8 (9.5), and 1.3 (10.6) pp respectively.

ppFEV1 results 
Patients ≥6 to <18 years: 
In the Unmatched Historical cohort, among the 120 (out of the 134 in this age group in IA1) patients 
aged ≥6 to <18 years, mean (SD) ppFEV1 was 95.7 (12.4) pp in the first year of follow-up. During the 
last year of follow-up (2011), mean (SD) ppFEV1 was 95.4 (12.9) pp (n=105). In adult patients, these 
figures were 73.3 (24.1) and 72.0 (23.9) pp in these two periods of time based on a number of 
patients of 246 and 201 respectively out of the 287 in the adult group.  
• 
ppFVC results 
Patients ≥6 to <18 years:  
Regarding ppFVC, in patients ≥6 to <18 years of age the mean (SD) ppFVC was 101.1 (12.7) pp at the 
beginning of the follow-up in 2009 (n=118 out of the 128 in this age group). At the end of the follow-
up in 2011 (n=102/128), the mean (SD) pp FVC was 99.4 (11.8) pp. In the adult group these values 
were 83.1 (20.1) pp based on data from 242 patients out of the 282 in this age group and 81.7 (19.5) 
pp at the end of the follow-up period in 2011 (n=191/282).  
Within IA1, the MAH provided descriptive statistics for the observed values of ppFEV1 in each 12-
month interval of follow-up for the Matched Historical cohort. Among 110 (out of 113) patients aged 
≥6 to <18 years with available data, mean (SD) ppFEV1 was 96.5 (11.2) pp in the first year of follow-
up. During the last year of follow-up (2011), mean (SD) ppFEV1 was 96.2 (11.4) pp (n=93). In adult 
patients, these figures were 75.2 (23.8) and 75.2 (23.3) pp in these two periods of time based on a 
number of patients of 180 and 134 respectively out of the 187 in the adult group.

•  Pulmonary Exacerbations and Hospitalizations 
Pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) are defined as intravenous (IV) antibiotic use at home or in the 
hospital; PEx requiring hospitalization represent a subset of PEx as above defined.  
Kalydeco cohort 
Patients ≥6 to <18 years:  
In the 36 months before Kalydeco treatment initiation, the annual proportion of patients ≥6 to <18 
years of age experiencing at least 1 PEx was relatively stable (Figure 19).  
In each of the 12-month intervals after Kalydeco treatment initiation, the proportion of patients with at 
least 1 PEx was numerically lower than in the period before treatment initiation. Statistical 
comparisons between the proportion of patients with at least 1 PEx in the 12-month interval 
immediately preceding treatment initiation and each 12-month post-treatment interval are presented 
in Table 33; these comparisons are based on the subgroups of patients with non-missing data in both 
intervals of interest.

Table 33 Kalydeco Cohort Patients ≥6 to <18 Years of Age: Statistical Comparisons of the 
Proportion of Patients With ≥1 PEx or Hospitalization in the 12 Months Before Kalydeco 
Treatment Initiation and Each 12-month Post-treatment Interval (Analysis interim 2) 
Within the IA1, in the subset of patients with non-missing data both in the 12 months pre- and post-
treatment initiation (n=101 out of the 109 patients in this age group), there was a numeric decrease in 
the proportion of patients who had at least 1 PEx in the 12 months after treatment initiation (7.9%, 
n=8 patients) compared to the 12 months immediately preceding treatment initiation (9.9%, n=10). 
An ad-hoc analysis restricted to patients with non-missing visits in all three pre-treatment intervals 
and first post-treatment interval (n=93 out of 109 patients in this age group) showed that in the 12 
months immediately before treatment initiation the proportion of patients who had at least a PEx was 
8.6% (n=8 patients who experienced 9 events). In the first year after treatment initiation the 
proportion was the same, i.e. 8.6%, i.e., no reduction was observed. Given that hospitalisation may 
occur due not only to PEx, the proportion of patients with at least an event of hospitalisation was 
higher in all periods of time than the proportion of patients with at least an event of PEx. In the year 
preceding treatment initiation, 16.2% (16/99) patients had at least an event of hospitalisation. This 
proportion was reduced to 13.1% (n=14 patients) in the first-year post-treatment. Similarly, there was 
a reduction of hospitalisation during the second-year post-treatment (from 17.1% to 9.8%, based on 
data available from 82 patients). The ad-hoc analysis provided with the IA1 for PEx requiring 
hospitalisation (n=93) showed exactly the same results as in the case of PEx (i.e., 8.6% patients had 
at least an event of this type in the year pre-treatment and in the year post-treatment). The results of 
the IA2 limited to hospitalisation due to PEx show similar results, i.e., all events of PEx in the age 
group ≥ 6 to less than 18 years old appear to require hospitalisation.   
Patients ≥2 to <6 years:  
Among patients ≥2 to <6 years, the proportion of patients with ≥1 PEx in the year immediately before 
treatment was 10.8% (7 out of the 65 paediatric patients with non-missing data in the time intervals 
Assessment report  
EMA/297262/2020

of interest who experienced 10 events). In the first and second-year post-treatment, this proportion 
was 4.6% (3 out of the 65 patients who experienced 5 events) and 8.6% (5 out of the 58 paediatric 
patients with non-missing data who experienced 7 events) respectively. An ad-hoc analysis (provided 
with the Interim Analysis 1) restricted to patients with non-missing visits in all three pre-treatment 
intervals and first post-treatment interval (n=52) shows that in the 12 months immediately before 
treatment initiation the proportion of patients who had at least a PEx was 13.5% (7 patients who 
experienced 10 PEx). In the first year after treatment initiation the proportion was 5.8% (3 patients 
who experienced 5 events).   
As for hospitalisations, in the year preceding treatment initiation, 15.4% (10 out of the 65 patients 
with non-missing data who experienced 13 events) had at least an event of hospitalisation. This 
proportion was reduced to 10.8% (7 patients who experienced 9 events of this type) in the first-year 
post-treatment. In the second-year post-treatment, 8.6% (5 out of the 58 patients with non-missing 
data who experienced 7 events) had at least an event of hospitalisation. The ad-hoc analysis provided 
with the IA1 for PEx requiring hospitalisation (n=52) showed that in the year preceding treatment, the 
proportion of patients with at least an event of this type was 13.5% (7 patients who experienced 10 
events), while in the first year post-treatment initiation this figure was 5.8% (3 patients who 
experienced 5 events). The results of the IA2 on PEx leading to hospitalisation show similar results, 
i.e., all events of PEx in the age group ≥2 to less than 6 years old appear to require hospitalisation.    
Adults: 
In the 36 months before Kalydeco treatment initiation, the annual proportion of adult patients 
experiencing at least 1 PEx was relatively stable (see Figure 20).  
In each 12-month interval after Kalydeco treatment initiation, the proportion of adult patients with at 
least 1 PEx was numerically lower than in the period before treatment initiation.  
Figure 20 Kalydeco Cohort Adult Patients: Proportion of Patients With ≥1 PEx by 12-month 
Interval During the 36 Months Before and 36 Months After Treatment Initiation 
Among adult patients treated with Kalydeco, there was a numeric decrease in the proportion of 
patients experiencing at least an event of PEx in the 12 months after treatment was initiated (12.2%,

n=24 subjects out of the 196 with non-missing data) as compared to the 12 months immediately 
before treatment began (20.5%, n=36 subjects out of the 176 with non-missing data). During the 
second-year post-treatment initiation, the proportion of adult patients with at least an event of PEx 
was 17.1% (n=21 subjects out of the 123 with non-missing data). A similar pattern was observed for 
PEx requiring hospitalizations although in adults not all of these events required hospitalisation. 
Regarding hospitalisations of any cause, there was a numeric decrease in the proportion of patients 
experiencing at least an event of hospitalisation in the 12 months after treatment was initiated 
(13.8%, n=27 patients out of the 196 with non-missing data) as compared to the 12 months 
immediately before treatment began (23.3%, n=41 subjects out of the 176 with non-missing data). 
During the second-year post-treatment initiation, the proportion of adult patients with at least an 
event of hospitalisation was 18.7% (n=23 subjects out of the 123 with non-missing data). Most events 
of hospitalisation in adult subjects are due to PEx.  
Historical cohort 
Unmatched Historical cohort:  
At the beginning of the follow up in January 2009 (N=518), the proportion of Unmatched Historical 
cohort patients who experienced at least an event of PEx was 7.8% (n=10 out of the 129 patients with 
non-missing data), 20.6% (n=52/252), and 3.2% (n=3/94) in the oldest paediatric group (N=134), 
adult group (N=282), and the youngest age group (N=97) which corresponds to a total number of 
events of 11, 89, and 3 respectively. The mean (SD) number of PEx was 0.09 (0.31), 0.35 (0.87), and 
0.03 (0.18) respectively. At the end of the follow-up period, in December 2011, these figures were 
11.0% (n=12), 19.9% (n=41), and 4.1% (n=3) which corresponds to a total number of events of 15, 
52, and 3 respectively. The mean (SD) number of PEx was 0.14 (0.44) 0.25 (0.60) 0.04 (0.20) 
respectively although based on a reduced number of subjects (due to missing data). After 3 years of 
follow-up, the percentage of adult subjects who experienced at least a PEx slightly decreased from 
20.6% to 19.9% while for the other two groups these figures were from 7.8% to 11.0% (≥ 6 to less 
than 18 year-old group) and from 3.2% to 4.1% (≥2 to less than 6 year-old group). 
Matched Historical cohort: 
At the beginning of the follow-up in January 2009, the proportion of Matched Historical cohort patients 
who experienced at least a PEx was 8 (7.1%), 35 (19.4%), and 3 (3.0%) in the oldest paediatric 
group, adult group, and the youngest age group respectively which corresponds to a total number of 
events of 8, 59, and 3. The mean (SD) number of PEx was 0.07 (0.26), 0.32 (0.85), and 0.03 (0.26) 
respectively. At the end of the follow-up period, in December 2011, these figures were 0.11 (0.34), 
0.21 (0.57), and 0.04 (0.19) although based on a reduced number of subjects (due to missing data). 
After 3 years of follow-up, the percentage of adult subjects who experienced at least a PEx decreased 
from 19.4% to 16.9% while for the other two groups these figures were from 7.1% to 9.6% (≥ 6 to 
less than 18 year-old group) and from 3.0% to 3.7% (≥2 to less than 6 year-old group). Descriptive 
statistics for Unmatched Historical cohort:  
Descriptive statistics for number of PEx requiring hospitalization are only provided for the unmatched 
Historical cohort (IA1 report) for 475 patients out of the 518 in the cohort distributed as follows in the 
first period of the follow-up (2009): 129 in the oldest paediatric group, 252 adults, and 94 in the 
youngest group. The mean (SD) number of these events was 0.08 (0.30), 0.29 (0.78), and 0.03 
(0.18) respectively which corresponds to 9 (7.0%), 44 (17.5%), and 3 (3.2%) patients having at least 
one of these events with a total number of events of 10, 73, and 3. In 2011, the number of subjects 
with available data was 389 (109, 206, and 74 patients respectively). The mean (SD) number of 
events was 0.14 (0.44), 0.17 (0.40), and 0.04 (0.20) with 12 (11.0%), 33 (16.0%), and 3 (4.1%) 
patients having at least one of the event of interest. The number of events was 15, 35, and 3

respectively. The results after 3 years of follow-up are somehow unexpected for the adult group in 
which the percentage of patients with PEx leading to hospitalisation decreased from 17.5% (73 events) 
in 2009 to 16.0% (33 events) in 2011. 
Regarding hospitalisation of any cause, the number and percentage of subjects in the Unmatched 
Historical cohort who had at least an event of this type at the beginning of the follow-up period in 2009 
was 16 (12.4%), 61 (24.2%), and 5 (5.3%) which corresponds to a total number of events of 22, 103, 
and 5 in the oldest paediatric group (n=129 with non-missing data), adult group (n=252), and the 
youngest age group (n=94) respectively. After three years of follow-up (2011), these figures were 14 
(12.8%), 51 (24.8%), and 8 (10.8%) which correspond to a total number of events of 27, 63, and 8 in 
each of these age groups albeit based on a reduced number of subjects (i.e., 109, 206, and 74 
subjects respectively) due to missing data.  
Overall, as in the Kalydeco cohort, most PEx in the two paediatric age groups required hospitalisation 
and most hospitalisations were due to PEx.   
Table 34 summarises descriptive statistics for number of subjects who experienced at least an event of 
PEx and of PEX requiring hospitalisation for the Kalydeco cohort and Table 35 for the matched 
historical Cohort. For patients in the Kalydeco cohort, results are based on the IA2. For the Historical 
Control data were obtained from the IA1.

Kalydeco cohort 
Patients ≥6 to <18 years: 
During the 36 months before Kalydeco treatment initiation, body mass index (BMI)-for-age z-scores in 
patients ≥6 to <18 years of age (N=107) were in the normal range and stable (Figure 21). In the 36 
months following treatment initiation, mean (SD) BMI-for-age z-scores remained stable in the normal 
range as shown by a mean (SD) absolute change from the index date to the first (n=94): -0.02 
(0.41); second (n=81): -0.03 (0.47); third (n=74): 0.00 (0.57) 12-month intervals after treatment 
initiation.  
Figure 21 Kalydeco Cohort Patients ≥6 to <18 Years of Age: Change in BMI-for-age z-score 
Over Time During the 36 Months Before and 36 Months After Treatment Initiation
Regarding weight-for-age z-scores, in the 12-month interval immediately preceding treatment 
initiation, the mean (SD) weight-for-age z-score was 0.32 (0.92) (n=99) in children aged 6 to less 
than 18 years. In the 36 months following treatment initiation, the mean (SD) absolute change from 
the value at the index date (0.42 [1.00], n=94) to the first 12-month interval (n=94) was 0.02 (0.26); 
it was 0.04 (0.37) during the second interval (n=81) and 0.06 (0.51) during the third one (n=75)

(Table 36). These figures for height-for-age z-score were 0.06 (1.01) at the index date (n=94), 0.03 
(0.15) during the first 12-month interval (n=94) after treatment initiation, 0.05 (0.26) during the 
second interval (n=81), and 0.06 (0.36) during the third one (n=74).  
Patients ≥2 to less than 6 years: 
Among children aged ≥2 to less than 6 years, the mean (SD) BMI-for-age z-score in the year 
immediately preceding treatment initiation (n=61) was 0.45 (1.05). In the 36 months following 
treatment initiation, the mean (SD) absolute change from the value at the index date (0.46 [1.05], 
n=60) to the first 12-month interval (n=60) was 0.11 (0.46); it was 0.07 (0.56) during the second 
interval (n=55) and 0.05 (0.68) during the third one (n=49). 
The absolute change in mean weight-for-age z-score from the index date (0.39 [1.00), n=60) to the 
first 12-month interval (n=60) was 0.07 (0.30); it was 0.11 (0.45) during the second interval (n=55) 
and 0.10 (0.57) during the third one (n=49). These figures for height-for-age z-score were 0.19 (0.98) 
at the index date (n=60), -0.01 (0.33) during the first 12-month interval (n=60) after treatment 
initiation, 0.07 (0.39) during the second interval (n=55), and 0.04 (0.50) during the third one (n=49). 
Among the 196 adult subjects in the Kalydeco cohort, 151 patients have data available on BMI at the 
index date and the first-year post-treatment initiation. The mean (SD) absolute change in BMI from 
the value at the index date (26.3 kg/m2 [5.9]) to the first-year post-treatment initiation was 0.3 kg/m2 
(1.19). During the second (n=111) and third (n=86) year, the mean (SD) absolute change in BMI was 
0.65 kg/m2 (1.80) and 1.01 kg/m2 (2.09) respectively. The mean (SD) weight at index date was 75.9 
kg (19.6) with a range from 44.6 to 161.5 kg. The mean (SD) absolute change from the value at the 
index date to the first 12-month interval following treatment initiation (n=157) was 0.9 kg (3.5). 
During the second (n=117) and third year (n=92), the mean (SD) absolute change was 1.7 kg (5.8) 
and 2.4 kg (6.6).   
Historical cohort 
Patients ≥6 to less than 18 years old and ≥2 to less than 6 years old:  
During the initial year of follow-up (2009), the number of patients ≥6 to less than 18 years old and ≥2 
to less than 6 years old with data available for weight-for-age z-score was 127 and 93 respectively. 
This number decreased (i.e., 106 and 72 respectively) at the end of the follow-up in 2011. The number 
of adult patients with available data on body weight and BMI decreased from 249 to 207.  
Mean (SD) BMI-for-age z-score was in the initial period 0.4 (1.0) and 0.2 (1.0) while in the final period 
of follow-up they were 0.4 (1.0) and 0.2 (0.9) (Table 37). The mean (SD) weight-for-age z-score was 
in the first period of follow-up 0.3 (1.2) and 0.1 (0.9) for the oldest and the youngest paediatric 
groups, respectively. At the end of the follow-up these values were 0.4 (1.2) in the oldest group and 
0.1 (0.9) in the youngest one (Table 37). Mean (SD) height-for-age z-scores at the beginning of the 
follow-up period in 2009 was -0.12 (1.20) in children aged ≥ 6 to less than 18 years (n=124) and -
0.12 (0.93) in children aged ≥2 to less than 6 years (n=95). At the end of the follow-up period in 
2011, these figures were -0.01 (1.04) and -0.09 (0.95), respectively based on 103 and 78 patients 
with non-missing data for this parameter. Overall, the mean values of the anthropometric parameters 
were within 0.5 SD of the CDC referent population and stable during the 3 years of follow-up. 
Adults:  
As for adults, mean (SD) body weight in the initial period was 74.6 kg (17.7) which increased to 75.1 
kg (18.5) at the end of the follow-up. Mean (SD) BMI was 25.4 kg/m2 (5.6) and 25.7 kg/m2 (5.6) in 
these two periods which are in the upper range of what is considered normal weight according to the

•  Deaths and Transplantations 
In the Kalydeco cohort, as of 31 December 2018, there were no organ transplants among all paediatric 
patients <18 years of age. In 2018, there was 1 death among patients ≥2 to <6 years of age. There 
were 2 deaths in the adult population and 1 adult patient received an organ (kidney) transplant as 
reported in the first interim analysis (IA1). 
•  Chronic CF Complications 
Six selected complications of cystic fibrosis were analysed, i.e., (symptomatic) sinus disease, 
pulmonary complications (allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, asthma, haemoptysis, and

pneumothorax); cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD); distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS), 
hepatobiliary complications; and pancreatitis. For the composite outcome measure of hepatobiliary 
complications, events of gall stones, liver disease (cirrhosis), hepatic steatosis, liver disease (other), 
acute hepatitis and acute liver failure are included as defined by registry data collection. Analyses by 
individual entities were not prespecified in the approved study protocol and are therefore not provided.   
Kalydeco cohort  
The proportion of patients ≥6 to <18 years of age with sinus disease or pulmonary complications 
showed a slightly upward trend over time during the 36 months before Kalydeco initiation. While the 
proportion of patients with sinus disease or pulmonary complications continued to increase during the 
first 12 months after treatment initiation (Figure 22), the prevalence remained stable in the second 
and third 12-month intervals after treatment initiation. 
Figure 22 Kalydeco Cohort Patients ≥6 to <18 Years of Age: Changes in Sinus Disease and 
Pulmonary Complications Over Time During the 36 Months Before and 36 Months After 
Treatment Initiation 
In subjects with non-missing encounter data, 12 months before treatment initiation the percentage of 
paediatric patients with sinus disease in the age group ≥6 to less than 18 years old, adults, and 
children ≥ 2 to less than 6 years old was 25.5%, 49.1%, and 9.7% respectively (see Table 38 further 
below). Twelve months after treatment initiation, these figures were 30.5%, 55.2%, and 10.8% 
respectively. During the second 12-month interval, the percentage of patients with sinus diseases was 
as follows: 28.7%, 61%, and 10.5% (see Table 38 further below).  
Regarding pulmonary complications, 12 months before treatment initiation the percentage of paediatric 
patients aged 6 to less than 18 years old, adults, and children aged to 2 to less than 6 years was 
30.6%, 43.3%, and 9.7% which increased to 37.1%, 44.3%, and 12.3% during the first 12 months 
after treatment initiation respectively. In the second 12-month interval after treatment initiation these 
figures were 35.6%, 47.2%, and 12.3% respectively (Table 38). 
Regarding the remaining chronic complications assessed, in general, prevalence of these complications 
was low (<7%) in paediatric patients. In patients ≥6 to <18 years old, prevalence of DIOS was 
generally stable in the 36 months before Kalydeco initiation and decreased in each 12-month interval 
following treatment initiation. The prevalence of pancreatitis increased in each 12-month interval 
before Kalydeco initiation; in the 36 months following treatment initiation, prevalence decreased in 
each 12-month interval (Figure 23). There were no hepatobiliary complications reported in the second 
and third 12-month intervals after treatment initiation. As expected for R117H patients, rates of CFRD 
Assessment report

were 0% at every pre- and post-treatment interval. Trends in other chronic complications showed no 
discernible patterns. 
Figure 23 Kalydeco Cohort Patients ≥6 to <18 Years of Age: DIOS, Hepatobiliary 
Complications, and Pancreatitis, Over Time During the 36 Months Before and 36 Months 
After Treatment Initiation 
Historical cohort 
During the initial year of follow-up (2009), the number of patients ≥6 to less than 18 years old and ≥2 
to less than 6 years old with data available on sinus disease was 129 and 93 respectively. This number 
decreased at the end of the follow-up in 2011 (i.e., 108 and 72 respectively). The number of adult 
patients with available data on this complication decreased from 252 to 210.  
The percentage of paediatric subjects with sinus disease in the first period of follow-up was 14.7% and 
9.7% in the oldest and the youngest paediatric groups respectively. At the end of the follow-up, these 
values were 14.8% and 18.1% respectively. As for adults, the percentage of subjects with this 
complication was 33.3% in the initial period which increased to 44.8% after 3 years of follow-up.  
Regarding pulmonary complications, the percentage of paediatric subjects with such complications in 
the first period of follow-up (2009) was 14.7% (≥6 to less than 18 years old) and 5.4% (≥2 to less 
than 6 years old). At the end of the follow-up, these values were 20.4% and 22.2%, respectively. As 
for adults, these figures were 25.4% and 31.9% in each period respectively.  
There were no discernible trends in other chronic complications including DIOS, hepatobiliary 
complications, pancreatitis, and CFRD in any age group. 
Table 38 and Table 39 shows the prevalence of disease complications in paediatric patients of both 
cohorts. For the Kalydeco cohort data from the interim analysis 2 are provided while for the Historical 
Cohort data correspond to the Interim Analysis 1.

•  Pulmonary Microorganisms 
The prevalence of P aeruginosa and other pulmonary microorganisms including methicillin-sensitive S 
aureus, methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA), H influenzae, S maltophilia, A xylosoxidans, B cepacia 
complex, A fumigatus, and nontuberculous mycobacteria were examined.  
Kalydeco cohort 
In paediatric patients ≥6 to <18 years of age, the prevalence of P aeruginosa was constant during the 
36 months before Kalydeco initiation (Figure 24). In each of the 12-month intervals following 
treatment initiation, prevalence of P aeruginosa was numerically lower than in the 12 months before 
treatment initiation. 
Figure 24 Kalydeco Cohort Patients ≥6 to <18 Years of Age: Changes in P aeruginosa 
Prevalence Over Time During the 36 Months Before and 36 Months After Treatment 
Initiation  
In patients ≥6 to <18 years of age, prevalence of methicillin-sensitive S aureus, MRSA, and H 
influenzae were relatively stable in the 36 months before Kalydeco initiation. In the 36 months 
following initiation of Kalydeco, prevalence of methicillin-sensitive S aureus and MRSA had slight 
numeric increases while the prevalence of H influenzae decreased in the third 12-month interval after 
treatment initiation. No discernible patterns were observed for prevalence of other pulmonary 
microorganisms in paediatric patients ≥6 to <18 years of age, nor in patients ≥2 to <6 years of age 
(see Table 40). 
In the first 12 months of Kalydeco treatment, the prevalence of P aeruginosa among adult patients 
declined from 43.9% in the 12 months before treatment initiation to 39.7%. This decline was

maintained during the second 12-month interval after treatment initiation (40.4%). In the third 12-
month interval after treatment initiation, prevalence of P aeruginosa had a slight increase to 44.3%; it 
is noted that not all adult patients have completed the full 36 months of follow-up after treatment 
initiation.  
The prevalence of other pulmonary microorganisms was also assessed (Table 40). Among the adult 
population, there was a slight decline in the prevalence of methicillin-sensitive S aureus during the 36 
months after treatment initiation. There were no discernible patterns observed in the prevalence of 
other microorganisms in the adult population. 
Historical cohort 
During the initial year of follow-up (2009), the number of patients ≥6 to less than 18 years old and ≥2 
to less than 6 years old with bacterial culture available was 125 and 90 respectively. This number 
decreased at the end of the follow-up in 2011 (i.e., 104 and 72 respectively). The number of adult 
patients with available data decreased from 228 to 188.  
The prevalence of P aeruginosa in the paediatric group in the first period of follow-up was 12.8% and 
2.2% in the oldest and in the youngest paediatric groups respectively. At the end of the follow-up, 
these values were 12.5% and 6.9% in these two groups. As for adults, these figures were 39.9% in 
the initial period which increased to 45.2% after 3 years of follow-up.  
The prevalence of MSSA at the beginning period of follow-up in 2009 was 52.8% (≥6 to less than 18 
years old), 45.6% (≥2 to less than 6 years old), and 37.3% (adults). At the end of follow-up, three 
years later, these values were as follows: 56.7%, 52.8%, and 38.8%. 
As in the Kalydeco cohort, B cepacia complex was isolated in very few patients. 
Table 40 and Table 41 show the prevalence of selected organisms in paediatric patients in both 
cohorts. For the Kalydeco cohort data from the Interim Analysis 2 are provided. For the Historical 
cohort data correspond to those of the Interim Analysis 1.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
This extension of indication for Kalydeco for the treatment of paediatric patients with CF who have the 
R117H-CFTR mutation is now from the age of 6 months, instead of 12 months as initially proposed by 
the MAH. This was considered to be acceptable by CHMP given that Kalydeco granules (25 mg twice 
daily) are approved for children aged 6 months and weighing 5 kg with CF who have a pre-specified 
gating (class III) mutation in the CFTR gene (refer to procedure EMEA/H/C/002492/X/75). This is also 
further discussed in the clinical pharmacology part of this report.  
The main study in this application is study 110, a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ivacaftor in patients with CF aged 
6 years and older who have an R117H-CFTR mutation. Supportive studies to this application are study 
112, an open label extension study in which patients from study 110 were offered to roll over for an 
additional period of 104 weeks, and study 122 which is an ongoing, non-interventional study being 
conducted in subjects with CF who have the R117H mutation aged 2 years and older, adolescents, and 
adults.  
Study 110 
This study was initially submitted in variation procedure EMEA/H/C/002494/II/0027, the ppFEV1 
results in the small number of subjects 6 to 11 years of age (N = 17) favoured the placebo over

ivacaftor. With the exception of the sweat chloride response, which was comparable to that seen in 
patients ≥18 years of age, no other meaningful clinical responses to ivacaftor treatment were seen in 
children. The indication was therefore restricted to adults with CF and an R117H-CFTR mutation. With 
this application, the MAH reiterated the factors that could have affected the FEV1 results. The MAH 
considered that an increase in ppFEV1 in the placebo group combined with a modest decrease in 
ppFEV1 in the ivacaftor group could explain the observed results with ppFEV1 through week 24. 
Further, relevant mean reduction in sweat chloride levels was seen in all age subgroups in the ivacaftor 
arm, including 6 to 11 years of age (-26.59 mmol/L) in comparison with 1.04 mmol/L for the placebo 
group. Further, mean sweat chloride reduction was detected by Week 2 (first post-baseline time point 
assessed; -25.22 mmol/L) and were sustained through Week 24. The magnitude of the mean 
reduction was very similar to that of subjects ≥18 years of age in the ivacaftor arm. Treatment 
differences at all time points where sweat chloride levels were determined favoured ivacaftor. Little 
variation was seen in the CFQ-R respiratory domain scores for the placebo group during the treatment 
period, while the ivacaftor group experienced a substantial decrease in the mean CFQ-R respiratory 
domain scores at Week 2 and Week 16. For Weeks 4, 8, and 24, the mean differences versus placebo 
were smaller and ranged between -3.8 to 3.4 points.   
A correlation between sweat chloride and ppFEV1 was also explored. Overall, the data demonstrate 
that changes in sweat chloride are not predictive of changes in pulmonary function at the individual 
subject level which is not unexpected given that while the sweat glands, and sweat chloride 
concentrations, of CF patients show little change throughout life, the lungs and other organs are 
progressively damaged with age. However, when the data were evaluated together at a population-
level, the data do support that a positive relationship is observed i.e. populations who show 
improvements in sweat chloride would be expected to show improvements in pulmonary function when 
evaluated in totality as a population. 
Further, subjects enrolled in study 110 were required to have at least an allele of R117H-CFTR 
mutation and CF defined as either a sweat chloride value ≥60 mmol/L OR 2 CF-causing mutations AND 
chronic sinopulmonary disease. An assumption was made that all subjects would have had the R117H-
5T or R117H-7T alleles based on the study entry criteria but for a number of subjects an assumption 
needed to be made as the poly-T status and the phase of it was unknown. Within the request for 
supplementary information, the MAH was requested to clarify in which EU countries the R117H 
mutation was included in panels for genetic analysis and whether the poly-T status was determined. 
The MAH clarified that in most countries for which data have been provided the mutation was included 
in the panels and the poly-T status was determined. As the claimed indication clearly states that 
patients should have CF disease and the R1117H mutation, the CHMP concluded that there was no 
need to include a warning  in the SmPC of Kalydeco indicating that patients with R117H mutation 
should have the poly-T status determined as this should be part of the diagnostic algorithm of cystic 
fibrosis, in particular in young children who may be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic after 
newborn screening. Therefore, the below warning included in section 4.4. of the SmPC has been 
removed:  
‘Whenever possible the phase of the poly-T variant identified with the R117H mutation should be 
determined as this may be informative in considering treatment of patients with an R117H mutation 
(see section 4.2).’ 
However, the below statement included in section 4.2 of the SmPC is maintained  
 “The phase of the poly T variant identified with the R117H mutation should be determined in 
accordance with local clinical recommendations.”  
Based on non-published data, the MAH estimated that there may be approximately 1000 subjects with 
Assessment report

CF and the R117H mutation in the EU of whom ~52% are adults.  
Study 112 
Results from an interim analysis (through the Week 12 visit) of data from patients who were previously 
enrolled in study 110 was provided in variation procedure EMEA/H/C/002494/II/27. The final study 
results were provided in variation procedure EMEA/H/C/002494/II/0054. Patients from study 111 and 
study 113 who also rolled over into study 112 were not included in this interim analysis.  
Out of the 17 children from study 110, 13 rolled over to study 112. Their mean (SE) ppFEV1 was 90.7 
(5.2) percentage points at study 112 baseline. At study 112 week 104, only 4 children had data 
available on ppFEV1. At earlier points in time when the number of children with available data was 
higher (e.g., n=10 at week 48), the mean (SE) absolute change in ppFEV1 from study 112 baseline 
was 4.0 percentage points (2.5). These results were in contrast with the value observed in study 110. 
Similarly, a response in the respiratory domain of CFQ-R was observed at almost all time points in 
study 112. At baseline, mean (SE) respiratory domain score was 82.1 (5.6) points. Changes from 
baseline in the 6 to 11 years of age subgroup remained above the MCID at all but 1 time point (i.e., at 
Week 36) and ranged from 3.2 to 10.3.   
Only a small number of adolescents were enrolled in study 110 and rolled over into study 112. No 
issues of concern were identified in either study 110 or study 112 but overall definitive conclusions on 
efficacy could not be reached based on the small number of paediatric patients.  
Overall, the CHMP considered that the results of the randomised, double-blind study 110 could not be 
ignored and that results from study 112 could not supersede them. However, it was acknowledged that 
certain factors in study 110 could have played a role in the lack of response to ivacaftor because 
subjects 6 to 11 years of age had higher baseline ppFEV1 and were more likely to have an R117H-7T 
allele; and data from study 112 were reassuring in that the seemingly deteriorating effect in ppFVE1 
seen in study 110 was not kept in this age group at a longer duration of exposure.      
Extrapolation of efficacy from adult subjects to children (R117H mutation) 
Extrapolation of ivacaftor efficacy from adult subjects to children was considered. The MAH was of the 
view that extrapolation of ivacaftor efficacy from subjects ≥18 years of age to younger subjects is 
appropriate and in accordance with ICH E11 guideline based on the following:  
-  Adequate systemic exposure is achieved in children/adolescents, i.e., in the range of adult 
systemic exposure; 
-  Adequate safety data in children and adolescents as assessed in study 110, 112 and in other 
studies of ivacaftor in children and adolescents with gating (class III) mutations; 
- 
- 
Evidence that the same disease process exists in both adults and children; 
The fact that the ivacaftor mechanism of action and the sweat chloride/CFTR response to ivacaftor 
is similar across age groups. 
The CHMP acknowledged that the basic difference between adults and paediatric subjects (and 
particularly the youngest ones) refers to disease manifestations which are usually more advanced in 
older ages. Similarly, in classical CF, the predominant manifestation of the disease at young ages is at 
the level of the gastrointestinal tract in the form of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency while in older 
subjects the main cause of morbidity is lung disease. Other complications of CF also show a temporal

pattern and are more frequent in the paediatric age.  
Study 122  
The MAH initially submitted the first interim analysis (IA1) of this study which was due by 31 
December 2017. Upon request, the second interim analysis (IA2) which was scheduled in December 
2019 was provided with the responses to the Request for Supplementary Information. This analysis 
covers full 24 months of post-treatment outcome measures for all Kalydeco cohort patients, and up to 
36 months of post-treatment outcomes data for some of them. The final analysis is due in December 
2020, and this study is included in the EU RMP as a category 3 study.  
Statistical methods  
There were a number of differences between the analyses performed in IA1 and analyses described in 
the Statistical Analysis Plan. The most relevant are described below: 
As specified in the protocol, patients in the Historical Cohort were planned to be matched on age, sex, 
and lung function to patients in the Kalydeco Cohort. However, due to the differences in demographic 
and clinical characteristics of the 2 cohorts, effective matching was not achieved. Therefore, all 
patients enrolled in the CFFPR as of 01 January 2009 with an R117H mutation and without any record 
of previous exposure to CFTR modulators were included in the Historical Cohort. The SAP of IA2/final 
analysis indicates that there is no plan to perform further analysis on the matched Historical cohort.   
Both the final study 122 protocol and the SAP of the Interim Analysis 1 indicate that mixed-effects 
model for repeated measures (MMRM) and linear mixed effects (LME) analyses of spirometry endpoints 
and the LME analyses of nutritional parameters were described as potential analyses to be performed if 
warranted by the data. Model-based analyses as described in the protocol were not performed in the 
IA2 report and will not be performed in the final analysis.  
Baseline data  
Key baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of paediatric Kalydeco Cohort patients by age 
subgroup were provided in the IA1. Although the exact number of paediatric subjects does not coincide 
(i.e., 107 paediatric patients aged ≥ 6 to less than 18 years of age and 65 patients ≥ 2 to less than 6 
years in IA2) the slight difference is not expected to have an important impact on the baseline 
characteristics of the Kalydeco cohort. This is endorsed by CHMP considering that baseline 
demographic and disease characteristics will be provided in the final study report and re-discussed 
based on the final number of patients. 
Study participants 
To fulfil the objectives of the study two cohorts of patients were established in the registry; a non-
interventional Kalydeco cohort (referred to as ‘Kalydeco cohort’) and a historical cohort.  
Each patient in the Kalydeco cohort was attempted to be matched with at least one corresponding 
patient from the Historical cohort but the specified matching algorithm did not successfully achieve 
balance in ppFEV1 in the adult populations. Therefore, patients in the Historical cohort were not 
matched to those in the Kalydeco cohort which limits the accuracy of the conclusions that can be 
reached by comparing these two cohorts.  
Nevertheless, results in terms of ppFEV1 and PEx are presented for the Historical cohort matched to 
Kalydeco cohort patients on age, gender, and lung function in the IA1 analysis. As the main interest of 
the present study is the paediatric population, the MAH was requested by CHMP to provide and discuss 
comparative results between both cohorts for all outcome measures using the matched historical 
cohort. The MAH did not provide such comparison justifying that as per SAP IA2 no analyses are

Page 94/119 
 
 
 
planned on the matched historical cohort but only on the full, unmatched cohort. Data from the 
matched Historical cohort are presented within the IA1 analysis.  
Clarification has been also provided that even though model-based analyses of spirometry endpoints 
and nutritional parameters were described in the study protocol as potential analyses to be performed, 
these have been not been performed and will not be performed in the final analysis. As study 122 has 
been included in the Risk Management Plan (Category 3) this issue and the one mentioned above will 
be further reviewed at the time of assessment of the final analysis of study 122.  
Results 
-  Baseline data 
Kalydeco cohort  
Overall, the baseline data of the Kalydeco cohort are consistent with what is known about patients with 
the R117H mutation in terms of delayed diagnosis (mean age diagnosis in the adult cohort was 25.3 
years vs. 4 months in the youngest children identified via newborn screening), as well as nutritional 
status and lung function. 
Most patients had unknown poly-T status, precluding any subgroup analyses being conducted by this 
characteristic which is unfortunate but likely due to local recommendations on the genetic testing on 
the poly-T variant as suggested by the MAH in response to the CHMP question in this respect.  
In the all patients set of the Kalydeco cohort, 75 (20.4%) subjects (including 48 adults, 19 paediatric 
subjects in the oldest age group and 8 in the youngest one) have a record of Kalydeco treatment 
discontinuation which is not due to patients’ death or lost to follow-up. Compared to paediatric 
patients, adult patients had higher percentages of Kalydeco treatment discontinuation (24.5%) and 
loss to follow-up (22.4%).    
Historical cohort 
Mean (SD) ppFEV1 was 76.2 (23.5) in adults and 97.0 percentage points (pp) (11.2) in the paediatric 
group aged ≥6 years and older. Thirty-seven percent (36.9%) of adult subjects have ppFEV1 <70% 
while 27.4% of paediatric patients had PPFEV1 between 70 to 90 percentage points. Similar values 
were observed in the age groups of the Kalydeco cohort (99.3 [13.7] in paediatric patients aged ≥6 
years and older and 70.8 [24.6] in the adult group). Higher variability is observed in the adult group in 
both cohorts.  
Nutritional status for the paediatric population was normal for both the Historical cohort and the 
Kalydeco cohort while the mean BMI for adult population was higher and exceeded the WHO threshold 
of normal weight (25 kg/m2).   
As for the Kalydeco cohort, very few patients in the Historical cohort had their poly-T variant identified.  
Overall, the frequency of visits to the clinic in the year before treatment initiation was higher in the 
Kalydeco cohort than in the unmatched Historical cohort with less patients in the latter having the 
recommended number of yearly visits (i.e., quarterly). In children ≥6 to <18 years of age, 34.3% of 
patients in the Historical cohort had the recommended ≥ 4 clinic visits per year compared to 49.5% of 
patients in the same age group in the Kalydeco cohort. For the youngest children, these figures were 
36.1% versus 60.9% respectively while in adults the percentage of subjects in the Historical cohort 
having ≥ 4 visits was 25.8% versus 35.3% in the Kalydeco cohort. Once treatment with ivacaftor was 
initiated in the Kalydeco cohort, the percentage of patients with ≥ 4 visits to the clinic increased. This 
is particularly evident during the first-year post-treatment in the paediatric population. Later, this 
Assessment report

percentage tends to decrease or stabilise in all age groups.    
Further, in study 122, the age group from 6 to less than 18 years of age is presented together for both 
cohorts. However, compared to children, adolescents are at a higher risk of lung function decline. The 
MAH was requested to provide demographic and disease characteristics at baseline for children aged 6 
to less than 12 years and for adolescents in specific subsets of both cohorts (i.e., patients in the 
Kalydeco cohort with non-missing pre-treatment/index and post-treatment initiation data; and for the 
Historical cohort matched to patients in the Kalydeco cohort). This was not provided by the MAH based 
on the fact that the existing analyses of the 3 age subgroups predefined by the study protocol and SAP 
are sufficient to address the research question. In addition, the MAH considered that analysing 
subgroups of a subgroup post hoc would not be expected to be informative due to sample size 
limitations. This issue will be further assessed and discussed when the final analysis of study 122 
(listed as a category 3 study in the RMP) will be submitted for review.  
Outcomes and estimation 
The main goal of the Historical cohort is to give some context to the results observed in the Kalydeco 
cohort and to gather some temporal trends in the data. However, a systematic discussion comparing 
the same endpoints in both cohorts was lacking in both reports of the IA1 and IA2. The tables of study 
122 included in this report for changes in the outcome measures over time for both cohorts and from 
the matched Historical cohort when available, were therefore built during the assessment based on 
information available to CHMP and should be viewed with caution as they correspond to interim 
analyses of the data and due to the number of missing data over time. 
1.  Lung function  
Kalydeco cohort 
Better trends in ppFEV1 are observed in the subset of paediatric patients with non-missing data in the 
three pre-treatment intervals and in the first-year post-treatment initiation. The analysis restricted to 
paediatric subjects with non-missing data as above mentioned (n=71) shows an increase in mean 
ppFEV1 from 97 in the year preceding treatment initiation to 99.6 percentage points in the first year 
post-treatment, while in the Interim Analysis 2 the mean absolute change in ppFEV1 slightly increased 
after treatment initiation with a mean absolute change from the index date that ranged between 0.48 
to 1.13 percentage points during the three years post-treatment initiation. Of note, ppFEV1 data are 
not available for patients ≥2 to <6 years of age because spirometry is not widely performed on 
patients before the age of 6 years. 
Regarding the adult cohort the analysis restricted to subjects with non-missing data (n=110) shows a 
modest increase of the mean ppFEV1 from 66.7 pp in the year preceding treatment initiation to 68.1 
(23.8) pp in the year following treatment initiation. In the adult group, the mean absolute change in 
ppFEV1 ranged between 1.28 (first year post-treatment initiation) to 2.32 (second year) (Interim 
Analysis 2).  
The MAH was requested to provide not only the mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from the index value 
to the first-12 month after treatment initiation, but also the absolute values to calculate this change. 
Even though absolute changes were provided for subjects with observed ppFEV1 data based on which 
descriptive statistics were provided, the absolute ppFEV1 values which allow the calculation of the 
mean absolute change were lacking as this requires non-missing data prior and after treatment 
initiation. In the absence of further clarification, the CHMP considered that this issue remains unsolved 
and will be further discussed and assessed when the final analysis will be submitted for review.  
Historical cohort

Regarding the Unmatched Historical cohort, at the beginning of the follow-up, the mean (SD) ppFEV1 
in paediatric patients aged 6 to less than 18 years (n=120 out of the 134 paediatric patients) was 95.7 
(12.4) pp while in the adult group (n=246 out of 287 adult subjects) this value was 73.3 (24.1). At the 
end of the follow-up period, these figures were 95.4 (12.9) and 72.0 (23.9) pp respectively based on 
data available from 105 paediatric and 201 adult patients.  
As for the Matched Historical Control, at the beginning of the follow-up, the mean (SD) ppFEV1 (pp) in 
paediatric patients aged 6 years and older (n=110) was 96.5 pp (11.2) while in the adult group 
(n=180) this value was 75.2 pp (23.8). At the end of the follow-up period, these figures were 96.2 pp 
(11.4) and 75.2 pp (23.3) based on data from 93 and 134 subjects respectively. The percent of 
missing data with respect to the number of subjects who had ppFEV1 values collected at the beginning 
of the follow-up period is 15.5% and 25.5% respectively. As far as it can be concluded due to subjects 
with missing data, it seems that ppFEV1 remained stable in both paediatric and adult patients over the 
time of follow-up.  
The comparison of both cohorts in terms of ppFEV1 shows that in the Matched Historical cohort at the 
end of the follow-up period the mean ppFEV1 was 96.2 pp in paediatric patients aged 6 years and 
older versus 99.6 pp in the Kalydeco cohort the first year after treatment initiation (n=71 subjects with 
non-missing data in the three periods pre-treatment and the first year post-treatment, IA1). In the 
second-year post-treatment initiation mean ppFEV1 was 99.6 pp (n=87 out of the 107 paediatric 
patients with data available, IA2). These figures for adult subjects were 75.2 pp (n=134 out of the 187 
adult subjects in the Matched Historical cohort) versus 68.1 pp in the first-year after treatment 
initiation (n= 110 out of the 196 adult subjects with data available at the above indicated time 
intervals, IA1) and 72.2 in the second-year post-treatment initiation (n=120 out of the 196 adult 
subjects with data available, IA2).  
2.  Pulmonary exacerbations and pulmonary exacerbations requiring hospitalisation 
According to the report of IA1, pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) and use of IV antibiotics were the 
endpoints to be collected and analysed while the endpoint discussed was “pulmonary exacerbations 
and hospitalizations”. Reasons for hospitalization recorded by the registry could include not only PEx, 
but also pulmonary complication, gastrointestinal complication, transplant related, sinus infection, 
nontransplant surgery, and other. The MAH was requested to address hospitalisations due to PEx and 
due to other reasons independently. It was clarified that separate analyses for hospitalizations outside 
the context of PEx were not available because these were not prespecified in the approved study 
protocol. Nevertheless, data on PEx requiring hospitalisation and hospitalisations due to PEx and other 
causes are provided. In addition, it was clarified that PEx is defined as intravenous (IV) antibiotic use 
at home or in the hospital.   
Statistical comparisons of the percentage of patients with PEx between the 12-month interval 
immediately preceding the start of Kalydeco treatment and the first and second 12-month intervals 
after treatment initiation using the McNemar’s test did not show any statistically significant difference 
between periods in any of the sets of patients analysed except in the overall population (P =0.02) 
during the first year post-treatment initiation, a result that is driven by the reduction seen in adult 
subjects. Furthermore, no statistically significant differences were seen in the number of exacerbations 
in the paediatric groups which is not unexpected. However, in adult patients, a statistically significant 
difference (P = 0.005) was seen during the first-year post-treatment.    
In the 12 months preceding treatment initiation with Kalydeco, the percentage of subjects aged 6 to 
less than 18 years old who had at least an event of PEx was 10.9%. This figure for the youngest 
children was 11.5%. At the end of the follow-up of the matched Historical control the percentages in 
these two groups were 9.6% and 3.7%. The number of subjects in the Kalydeco cohort who had at 
Assessment report  
EMA/297262/2020  
Page 97/119 
 
 
 
least one PEx prior treatment initiation with Kalydeco was systematically higher than that of the 
Historical cohort which is somehow a striking finding as historical cohorts usually show worse outcomes 
than more recent cohorts as standard of care improves over time. After treatment initiation, 
percentages were 6.9% and 8.6% during the second-year post-treatment initiation in the oldest and 
the youngest age groups respectively which in the case of the latter is still above the value seen in the 
Historical Cohort; this will be further addressed below.  
3.  Nutritional Parameters 
Kalydeco cohort 
Data show that patients with the R117H-CFTR mutation tend to have, as a group, normal growth which 
may be related to the fact that many of them are usually pancreatic sufficient and present with 
preserved lung function. Treatment with Kalydeco in paediatric patients was not associated with 
meaningful changes with respect to the period pre-treatment which is not unexpected taking into 
account the normal range of the mean anthropometric parameters at the index date and during the 
pre-treatment period.   
CF has usually been associated with malnutrition. However, due to early diagnosis, nutritional 
supplements, and increased prevalence of obesity in the general population, overweight, and obesity in 
the CF patient population is also of concern. In the Kalydeco cohort there were both malnourished and 
overweight/obese subjects as shown by the range of values of the growth parameters analysed. 
Weight-for-age z-score in children aged ≥ 6 to less than 18 years ranged in the year immediately 
before treatment initiation between -1.7 to 2.4. During the second-year post-treatment these figures 
were -1.4 and 3.0. In the youngest children in the Kalydeco cohort, two years after treatment initiation 
weight-for-age z-score ranged from -1.1 to 3.9. While according to WHO definitions no paediatric 
patients were underweight as the minimum value was above -2SD of the population of reference (but 
closed to it), the maximum value is indicative that some paediatric patients may be overweight/obese. 
This is confirmed by the maximum value of BMI-for-age z-score in the two paediatric age groups which 
exceeds the cut-off of + 2SD (indicative of overweight) and of + 3SD (indicative of obesity). The latter 
is particularly the case of the youngest children.   
In the case of adult patients, the mean BMI values at the year immediately preceding treatment with 
Kalydeco and during the second year post-treatment were 25.44 kg/m2 and 26.67 kg/m2 which are 
above the cut-off of 25 that defines overweight according to the WHO definition. The minimum values 
of BMI also indicate that some subjects were malnourished as shown by minimum BMI values.  
The MAH was requested to provide a separate analysis confined to malnourished and overweight/obese 
paediatric subjects using the appropriate WHO definitions. Nevertheless, the MAH clarified that such 
analysis was not possible due to the absence of patients meeting the WHO definition of malnourished 
and the lack of sufficient numbers of overweight/obese patients (<5 expected). This is acceptable by 
CHMP.  
Unmatched Historical cohort 
During the initial year of follow-up, the number of patients ≥6 to less than 18 years old and ≥2 to less 
than 6 years old with data available for weight-for-age was 127 and 93 respectively. This number 
decreased (i.e., 106 and 72 respectively) at the end of the follow-up. The number of adult patients 
with available data on body weight and BMI decreased from 249 to 207.  
The mean (SD) weight-for-age z-score in the first period of follow-up was 0.3 (1.2) and 0.1 (0.9) for 
the oldest and the youngest paediatric groups respectively. At the end of the follow-up these values 
were 0.4 (1.2) in the oldest paediatric cohort and 0.1 (0.9) in the youngest one. Mean (SD) BMI-for-
age z-score was in the initial period 0.4 (1.0) and 0.2 (1.0) while in the final period of follow-up they 
Assessment report  
EMA/297262/2020  
Page 98/119 
 
 
 
were 0.4 (1.0) and 0.2 (0.9). Therefore, values of these parameters were within 0.5 SD of the CDC 
referent population and stable during the 3 years of follow-up.  
As for adults, mean (SD) body weight in the initial period was 74.6 kg (17.7) which increased to 75.1 
kg (18.5) at the end of the follow-up. Mean (SD) BMI was 25.4 kg/m2 (5.6) and 25.7 kg/m2 (5.6) in 
these two periods which are in the upper range of what is considered normal weight according to the 
WHO threshold. As for the Kalydeco cohort, maximum and minimum values indicate that the Historical 
cohort included underweight and overweigh/obese patients. 
4.  Deaths and Transplantations 
In the Kalydeco cohort, as of 31 December 2018, there were no organ transplants among all paediatric 
patients <18 years of age. In 2018, there was 1 death among patients ≥2 to <6 years of age. There 
were 2 deaths in the adult population and 1 adult patient received an organ (kidney) transplant as 
reported in the first interim analysis (IA1). 
No data were provided for the Historical cohort on deaths and transplantation during the follow-up 
period. Upon request by CHMP, the MAH clarified that these data will be provided with the final study 
report.  
5.  Chronic CF Complications 
Analyses by individual entities within each of the CF complications analysed have not been performed 
as they were not prespecified in the study protocol and SAP. In addition, due to sample size limitations 
and low incidence and prevalence of some of these events in the paediatric population they may not be 
sufficiently informative.  
An increase in the percentage of subjects with sinus disease and pulmonary complications in the three 
age groups was observed in the first 12 months following treatment initiation with ivacaftor which was 
attributed by the MAH to the chronic, progressive nature of CF. Indeed, patients with classical CF 
disease have a high incidence of (chronic) rhinosinusitis. While progression of the disease over time is 
in line with the observed upward trend of these two complications during the 36 months before 
treatment initiation, some of the very common adverse events described for ivacaftor overlap with the 
classical symptoms of rhinosinusitis such as rhinorrhoea, nasal obstruction, mouth breathing, and 
headache. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that treatment with ivacaftor may have also contributed to 
the increased incidence of these complications. Nevertheless, the records of treatment discontinuation 
during the first 12-month interval post-treatment for the overall population of this cohort were small 
(i.e., 9.5%) which suggests that these complications could be managed. During the second and third 
12-month intervals of treatment, these complications tend to stabilise in paediatric patients while 
among adult patients their prevalence continued to increase. As for all other outcome measures, 
additional comparative data between two specific subsets of subjects in the Kalydeco and the matched 
Historical cohort was requested to gather further information. This has not been provided by the MAH 
but the data submitted with the Interim Analysis 2 partially address the concern caused by the 
increased prevalence of these complications in paediatric patients after treatment initiation with 
ivacaftor.  
Trends in other chronic complications including DIOS, hepatobiliary complications, and CFRD showed 
no discernible patterns in either adults or paediatric patients. Mild to moderate liver enzyme elevations 
are not uncommon among young children with CF. Treatment with ivacaftor has been associated with 
liver enzymes increases, in particular transaminases, which is slightly more frequent in young children 
than in older patients. The present data do not suggest that treatment initiation with Kalydeco is 
associated with an increase in hepatobiliary complications. The SmPC of Kalydeco includes 
recommendations to monitor liver function tests.   
Assessment report  
EMA/297262/2020  
Page 99/119 
 
 
 
Data on pancreatitis show a progressive decrease over time in the three age groups of the Kalydeco 
cohort that seems particularly relevant in the oldest paediatric group and in adult subjects and 
consistent with literature data on the manifestation and evolution of the CF disease.  
6.  Pulmonary Microorganisms 
The results in terms of pulmonary microorganisms should be interpreted with caution and in light of 
the changing microbiology of the lung with age. Initially the main colonising bacteria is the Gram-
positive Staphylococcus aureus, which affects around 50% of patients during infancy. However, its 
incidence declines later in life and infections with the Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa become 
more prominent. Other microorganisms also known to infect the CF airways include H. influenzae, 
methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and S. maltophilia which can be routinely and appropriately 
treated while Burkholderia (ceno)cepacia are harder to detect and treat. Infections with B. 
(ceno)cepacia have a low incidence but are associated with a high mortality.  
The number of subjects in the Kalydeco cohort with bacterial culture available in the 12-month interval 
preceding treatment initiation was 99 (≥6 to less than 18 years old), 164 (adults), and 63 (≥2 to less 
than 6 years old). In the oldest paediatric group, the prevalence of P aeruginosa was 16.2% in the 12-
month interval preceding treatment initiation and decreased to 15.5%, 9.2%, and 11.0% in the three 
12-month intervals following treatment initiation with Kalydeco. In the youngest children, these figures 
were 15.9% (pre-treatment) and 3.1%, 3.4%, and 0% post-treatment. As expected the highest 
prevalence is seen in adult subjects, i.e., 43.9% in pre-treatment and 39.7%, 40.4%, and 44.3% in 
each of three 12-month intervals post-treatment. Overall, the prevalence of P aeruginosa numerically 
decreased during the post-treatment period except for the third 12-motnh interval for which data are 
not completed.   
An ad-hoc analysis performed at the time of the Interim Analysis 1 in a subset of subjects who have 
data available in all three time intervals pre-treatment and during the first 12 months post-treatment, 
showed that the number of subjects with available data (i.e., bacterial culture) as indicated was 92 
(≥6 to less than 18 years old), 113 (adults), and 50 (≥2 to less than 6 years old). In the oldest 
paediatric group, the prevalence of P aeruginosa was 15.2% in the period from >24 to 36 months pre-
treatment and decreased to 13.0% in the first 12-month interval after treatment initiation with 
Kalydeco. In the youngest children, these figures were 6.0% and 2.0% in these two periods. As 
expected the highest prevalence is seen in adult subjects, i.e., 50.4% in the first period and 46.0% 
after treatment initiation with Kalydeco. 
The prevalence of methicillin-susceptible S aureus (MSSA), a more relevant pathogen for children as 
many of them with classical CF are chronically colonised by this organism, was 58.6% in the 12-month 
interval preceding treatment initiation and 56.3%, 63.2%, and 63.4% in the three 12-month intervals 
following treatment initiation with Kalydeco. In the youngest children, these figures were 15.9% (pre-
treatment), and 58.5%, 53.4%, and 58.8% in each of the three 12-month intervals post-treatment. In 
adult subjects, the prevalence of MSSA was 39.6% (pre-treatment), and 43.6%, 35.1%, and 31.8% 
post-treatment. The prevalence of methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) in the three age groups 
during the 36 months pre-treatment and after treatment initiation remained below 20%. While in adult 
patients, after treatment with ivacaftor, the overall prevalence of P aeruginosa decreased, this was not 
the case of S. aureus in paediatric patients.      
The prevalence of P aeruginosa in the 12-month interval prior treatment initiation with Kalydeco seems 
abnormally high in the youngest paediatric group (15.9%) when compared to the prevalence of the 
Historical cohort at the beginning of the follow-up period in that cohort (2.2%). Over time, prevalence 
of P aeruginosa tended to increase in the Historical cohort (6.9% at the end of the follow-up period) 
and to decrease in the Kalydeco cohort (3.4% during the second 12-month interval post-treatment 
Assessment report  
EMA/297262/2020  
Page 100/119 
 
 
 
initiation) for this group of patients. The prevalence of P aeruginosa in adult subjects in the Kalydeco 
cohort pre-and post-treatment as well as that of the Historical cohort are higher than reported for 
patients with this mutation in CFTR2 (i.e., 27% among 1,819 patients with this mutation in the 
database distributed as follows: 156 children below 10 years of age, 287 between 10 to 20 years and 
661 older than 20 years of age). In the overall population of the Kalydeco and Historical cohorts these 
percentages are 21.6% (second 12-month interval post-treatment) and 28.3% (at the end of the 
follow-up period in 2011) which are more similar to the percentage in CFTR2.    
In summary, in study 122, treatment with Kalydeco seems to be associated with a limited increase in 
ppFEV1 and a reduction in PEx that are more relevant for the adult population. Very limited changes 
are seen in terms of body weight and BMI which is not unexpected given the preserved nutritional 
status of subjects in the Kalydeco cohort as shown by mean values within the normal range or, even, 
values exceeding normal weight as overweight/obesity is an increasing concern in patients with CF 
which may also have a deleterious effect on lung function. Among the 3 age groups in the Kalydeco 
Cohort, the proportion of patients with sinus disease and pulmonary complications showed an upward 
trend over time during the 36 months before Kalydeco initiation. During the first 12 months after 
treatment initiation, the proportion of patients with sinus disease and pulmonary complications 
continued to numerically increase and later during the second and third 12-month intervals post-
treatment, these complications tend to stabilise in paediatric patients while the opposite trend is 
observed among adult patients. The overall increase observed in the Kalydeco cohort seems to be 
attributed to disease progression. However, it cannot be completely ruled out that ivacaftor has a role 
as some of its common adverse effects overlap with the classical symptoms of sinus disease. In terms 
of pulmonary microorganisms, the prevalence of P aeruginosa declined during the first 12 months of 
treatment as compared to the 12-month interval immediately preceding the index. This was not the 
case of S aureus in paediatric patients.  
The above results should be viewed with caution given that missing data may introduce 
misclassification of exposure and outcomes data in observational studies. The US CFFPR, however, has 
robust systems in place to minimize missing data in its database. In addition, in observational studies 
with non-randomised treatment assignments, confounding by indication may be of concern as indeed 
patients treated with Kalydeco may be systematically different and have different risk factors for 
adverse outcomes than patients who are not treated. This is limited by the within-group comparison of 
outcomes in patients for 36 months before and 36 months after initiation of Kalydeco. Finally, precise 
treatment start dates and event occurrence dates may not be available. Consequently, the person-time 
data may be unavailable and the temporal relationship between exposure and outcome challenging to 
establish.  
Further, use of a historical cohort from an earlier time period may be biased by the different standards 
of care that were applied from 2009 through 2011, as well as by differences in the population of CF 
patients over time. In this respect, it is noted that for the outcome measures of PEx, sinus disease, 
pulmonary complications and prevalence of P aeruginosa, patients in the Kalydeco cohort in the pre-
treatment period showed, in general, worse outcomes (i.e., higher frequency) than those of the 
Historical cohort at the beginning of the follow-up period (and for some of them even at the end of the 
3-year follow-up). Considering that historical cohorts usually show worse outcomes than more recent 
ones as standard of care improves over time, further clarifications were requested. Possible 
explanations from the MAH  include the following, i.e., 1) changes in the standard of care of CF 
patients over time as well as changes in registry data collection practices over time; 2) the lower 
frequency of visits in the historical period which may explain also the lower recorded frequency of 
select outcome measures compared to the pre-treatment period in the Kalydeco Cohort; and 3) 
channelling bias or confounding by indication, where sicker patients would be more likely to initiate 
Kalydeco therapy. It is agreed that all, but particularly the channelling bias, appear likely factors that 
Assessment report

may contribute to the above findings.   
Overall discussion on efficacy 
Kalydeco has now been approved down to children aged 6 months and weighing at least 5 kg with CF 
who have certain gating (class III) mutations in the CFTR gene based on single arm pharmacokinetic 
and safety studies (with efficacy variables collected as secondary/exploratory endpoints). Extrapolation 
of efficacy from adults to the paediatric population has been accepted based on similar systemic 
exposure as in adults or older paediatric patients at the selected doses, the mechanism of action of 
ivacaftor which acts similarly in adults and paediatric patients, a similar response in sweat chloride and 
on the pathogenesis of the disease that is expected to be comparable between paediatric and adult 
populations, although there may be significant age-dependency for the presence of certain symptoms 
and signs of the disease or showing a different pattern of organ damage.  
Further, in studies in children under 6 years of age with specified CFTR gating mutations, faecal 
elastase-1 and immunoreactive trypsinogen which are markers of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, 
were also assessed. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is usually established early in life and the 
greatest chance to assess whether ivacaftor is able to delay or reverse the progression of this CF 
complication is in the youngest children. The available results of study 108 (children aged 2 to less 
than 6 years of age) and of study 124 (children below 2 years of age, still ongoing in the age cohort 
below 6 months) showed that in some children faecal elastase-1 values reverse to normal or near 
normal levels. Despite normal or stable lung function as measured by FEV1, studies using high-
resolution computed tomography (HRCT) have shown lung damage (such as airway wall thickening 
and bronchiectasis). HRCT studies in infants with CF who were diagnosed by newborn screening, but 
were considered clinically healthy, indicate that structural lung damage is common even very early in 
disease progression. In addition, there may be further systemic beneficial effects expected given that 
CFTR dysfunction affects multiple organs in CF patients. As life-expectancy in patients with CF 
increases, other complications, which are also important causes of morbi-mortality, such as CF-related 
diabetes (Barrio R, 2015) and CF-related liver disease (Leeuwen L et al, 2014) have emerged which 
may respond to treatment with CFTR modulators. The benefits of an early intervention have been 
shown in children diagnosed soon after birth, particularly in what refers to promote normal growth as 
early diagnosis allows nutritional intervention. Therefore, there is a reasonable expectation that by 
starting ivacaftor treatment early in life, disease progression can be slowed down or halted on the 
basis that CFTR modulators target the mutated CFTR protein rather than the downstream 
consequences of its defect. This is currently being explored in an ongoing registry-based post-
authorisation efficacy study of ivacaftor in young children with certain class III gating mutations.   
Such study has been included in the RMP and final results will be provided as a post-approval 
commitment.      
A major objection was raised to further discuss the rationale behind the proposed unrestricted 
indication, in particular for children under the age of 6 years (and even more under 2 years of age), as 
ivacaftor is expected to be administered lifelong in these children, who may be minimally symptomatic 
at the time of diagnosis and who may eventually not develop the classical form of disease. 
Additionally, the MAH was also requested to discuss possible markers allowing the identification of 
young CF patients at a higher risk of lung disease as well as the upward trend in sinus disease and 
pulmonary complications seen during the 12 months post Kalydeco treatment. In response, no 
markers which may permit the identification of young CF patients with the R117H-CFTR mutation who 
are at higher risk of lung disease (or other complication of CF) were discussed on grounds that CF 
disease is present since birth as shown (e.g.) by structural lung disease in high-resolution computed 
tomography. Regarding the upward trend of sinus disease and pulmonary complications that was 
observed in the Kalydeco cohort of study 122 during the first 12 months following treatment initiation 
Assessment report  
EMA/297262/2020  
Page 102/119 
 
 
 
with ivacaftor, the additional data presented in the Interim Analysis 2 showed that in the paediatric 
age groups both complications tended to stabilise during the second and third 12-month interval post-
treatment. This is acknowledged by CHMP.  
According to current diagnostic consensus guidelines, the diagnosis of CF is confirmed if the subject 
harbours an R117H-5T mutation. For subjects with an R117H-7T mutation, the diagnosis of CF is 
confirmed in case sweat chloride is above 60 mmol/l or other evidence of CFTR dysfunction is present 
(e.g., nasal potential difference or intestinal current measurement). The diagnosis of CF is not 
confirmed in case of an R117H-7T mutation and sweat chloride below 60 mmol/l in the absence of 
advanced testing as above mentioned. In Europe, these babies are named CF screen positive 
inconclusive diagnosis (CFSPID), and a balance is trod between ‘ignoring’ their potential for developing 
problems and over-medicalising them. Currently most infants detected on newborn screening with an 
R117H-7T will not fulfil CF diagnostic criteria and will remain asymptomatic. Children with an R117H-
7T mutation who does not fulfil the current, stringent diagnostic criteria for CF should not be treated 
with CFTR modulators unless their diagnosis evolves over time and/ or is influenced by the 
development of CF disease or a relevant family history, all of which would be grounds to reconsider the 
treatment with CFTR modulators. Given that sweat chloride concentrations may increase, particularly 
in the first few years of life, these can be monitored in those with intermediate levels initially. 
Therefore, the key issue in the view of the CHMP is the confirmation of the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis 
in presence of the R117H-CFTR mutation. In asymptomatic young children this requires genetic 
analysis (including the poly-T status) and sweat chloride determination. Most subjects with the R117H-
7T mutation will never developed cystic fibrosis but as there are cases reported, the CHMP considered 
that the indication should be kept broad (for patients with CF and R117H mutation) to allow treatment 
of the subjects if needed.   
In summary the data provided in this application for patients less than 18 years are considered 
sufficient to approve the extension of indication of Kalydeco to paediatric patients with CF and the 
R117H mutation considering also extrapolation of efficacy from adult subjects with the R117H-CFTR 
mutation. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The final clinical study report of study 112, submitted two years after the initial application, gives 
reasonable reassurance that the seemingly deteriorating effect of ivacaftor in lung function seen in 
study 110 in children aged 6 to 11 years old (inclusive) was not present, although the magnitude of 
the effect of ivacaftor in ppFEV1 was limited. A positive effect was also seen in the respiratory domain 
of the CFQ-R. Further, the magnitude of the decrease of sweat chloride in these paediatric patients 
was similar to the reduction seen in adult subjects. The trends in outcomes in paediatric patients 
observed in the interim analysis of Study 122 are consistent with the trends observed in adult patients 
with the R117H-CFTR mutation, and with the known benefit-risk profile of ivacaftor.  
The CHMP considered that extrapolation of efficacy from adults with R117H mutation to children may 
be applied on the basis that adequate systemic exposure is achieved in children/adolescents, there are 
evidence that the same disease process exists in both adults and children; and the ivacaftor 
mechanism of action and the sweat chloride/CFTR response to ivacaftor is similar across age groups. 
In light of the above, the CHMP concluded that the indication claimed, i.e., for the treatment of 
paediatric patients aged 6 months and older WITH cystic fibrosis AND who have an R117H mutation is 
therefore acceptable.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Study 110 and Study 112 
Comparative safety data have been generated in a small number of paediatric patients aged 6 years 
and older and in a single adolescent (n = 10) with CF and the R117H mutation who have been treated 
with ivacaftor in study 110 up to 24 weeks. Longer-term safety data up to 96 weeks of additional 
treatment are available from study 112. Both studies were assessed in prior procedures and therefore 
only a brief summary is provided below.  
The safety set of study 110 included 69 patients (adults and paediatric subjects) who have received at 
least 1 dose of ivacaftor or placebo. Analysis of the occurrence of AEs and SAEs, including events of 
special interest, laboratory parameters, safety data in special populations, etc., did not reveal major 
inconsistencies with the already known profile of ivacaftor. It is likely that the limited number of 
patients enrolled in study 110 contributed to the difficulty to capture the AEs that occur less 
frequently.  
Study 112 enrolled patients with CF who completed study 110, study 111 (patients with a non-G551D-
CFTR mutation), and study 113 (patients who have phenotypic or molecular evidence of residual CFTR 
function). Study 110 contributed with 54% of the studied safety population.  
Overall, results of the safety assessment indicated that ivacaftor was well tolerated for up to 96 weeks 
of additional treatment. The safety findings were also consistent with the known safety profile of 
ivacaftor. Although an increase in blood pressure without clinical relevance was identified, no changes 
in the Product Information were deemed necessary at this stage. Nevertheless, the MAH was requested 
to closely monitor this safety concern in future PSURs. 
The number of children aged 6 to 11 years of age (inclusive) and adolescents with an R117H mutation 
is very small for a full characterisation of the safety profile of ivacaftor in children. However, given that 
the genotype has not been identified as relevant from the safety perspective, reassurance on the 
safety profile is obtained from paediatric patients with class III gating mutations. The ivacaftor safety 
database includes 61 patients between 6 to less than 12 years of age and 94 patients between 12 to 
less than 18 years of age.  
Similarly, for children aged 2 years to less than 6 years who have the R117H mutation, the only source 
of data is study 122 (see below) but safety can be also extrapolated from children with class III gating 
mutations enrolled in study 108 (2 to less than 6 years old) which have been assessed in procedure 
EMEA/H/C/002494/X/34. The ivacaftor safety database includes 34 patients between 2 to less than 6 
years of age. 
Study 122  
In this study children 2 to less than 6 years of age, ≥6 to less than 18 years of age, and adults all of 
them with the R117H mutation are being followed. Study 122 is the only source of data in children 
aged 2 to less than 6 years with this variant. Although one of the stated objectives of this study is to 
confirm the long-term safety of ivacaftor, no detailed discussion is provided on safety in the report of 
the interim analysis 2 but some of the outcome measures of the study (e.g., deaths, some selected 
disease complications etc.) are useful from a safety perspective. Given that study 122 is a non-
interventional study based on the secondary use of data, reporting of suspected adverse reactions as 
individual case safety reports is not required. This is acknowledged.  
Death 
Three deaths have been reported in the Interim Analysis 2 in the Kalydeco cohort of this study, two 
adult patients and a child aged ≥2 to less than 6 years died.

Sinus disease and pulmonary complications 
An increase in sinus disease and pulmonary complications was observed in all age groups before 
treatment initiation and during the first 12 months after treatment initiation in the Interim Analysis 1.  
Sinus disease: 
In subjects with non-missing encounter data, 12 months before treatment initiation the percentage of 
paediatric patients with sinus disease in the age group ≥6 to less than 18 years old, adults, and 
children ≥ 2 to less than 6 years old was 25.5%, 49.1%, and 9.7% respectively.  
Twelve months after treatment initiation, these figures were 30.5%, 55.2%, and 10.8% respectively.  
During the second 12-month interval, the percentage of patients with sinus diseases was as follows: 
28.7%, 61%, and 10.5%.  
Pulmonary complication: 
Regarding pulmonary complications, 12 months before treatment initiation the percentage of paediatric 
patients ≥6 to less than 18 years old, adults, and children aged to 2 to less than 6 years was 30.6%, 
43.3%, and 9.7% which increased to 37.1%, 44.3%, and 12.3% during the first 12 months after 
treatment initiation respectively. In the second 12-month interval after treatment initiation these 
figures were 35.6%, 47.2%, and 12.3% respectively.  
Data from the Interim Analysis 2 suggest that in the paediatric population sinus disease and 
pulmonary complications tended to stabilise in the second 12-month interval following treatment. 
However, this was not the case for adult subjects where the numerical increase continued.  
No safety data are available for children under 2 years of age who have the R117H-CFTR mutation. 
Safety, in this case, is extrapolated from children with class III gating mutations enrolled in study 124 
below 2 years of age. The ivacaftor safety database includes 25 patients between 12 months to less 
than 24 months of age and 14 patients between 6 months to less than 12 months of age. 
Post marketing experience 
Since the initial IVA marketing approval in January 2012, more than 6500 patients have been treated 
with IVA, representing over 17,000 person-years of exposure. Post-marketing exposure in patients less 
than 18 years of age is estimated to be approximately 30% of overall post-marketing exposure. The 
safety data from post-marketing experiences were consistent with data from clinical studies, including 
the 5-year post-authorization safety study (PASS), and are also consistent between patients 18 years 
of age and older and patients less than 18 years of age. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The overall safety database of paediatric patients is small, in particular for the youngest children but 
supported by post-marketing data. Safety risks from placebo-controlled studies (study 103 and study 
110) and from single arm studies (study 108 and study 124) did not reveal significant unfavourable 
effects which were not known already.  
With regards to study 122, although one of the stated objectives was to confirm the long-term safety 
of ivacaftor, no discussion could be found on safety in the interim analysis reports. While some of the 
outcome measures could be useful from a safety perspective (e.g., deaths, some selected disease 
complications etc.) when it comes to adverse events no data were provided. Upon request by CHMP, 
Assessment report  
EMA/297262/2020  
Page 105/119 
 
 
 
the MAH clarified that as study 122 is based on the secondary use of data, reporting of suspected 
adverse reactions as individual case safety reports is not required. This was acknowledged by CHMP.  
Increase in sinus disease and pulmonary complications were seen in the Kalydeco cohort of study 122. 
The MAH was of the view that those observations made over time and during the first year after 
treatment initiation with ivacaftor were consistent with the chronic and progressive nature of CF. 
Patients with classical CF disease have a high incidence of (chronic) rhinosinusitis. Nevertheless, some 
of the common adverse events described for ivacaftor overlap with the classical symptoms of 
rhinosinusitis such as rhinorrhoea, nasal obstruction, mouth breathing, and headache. Therefore, it 
cannot be ruled out that treatment with ivacaftor may also be contributing to the increased incidence 
of these complications. However, the records of treatment discontinuation in the registry for the overall 
population of this cohort were small (i.e., 9.5%) during the first year which suggests that these 
complications could be managed. Although, comparative data in specific datasets of subjects in the 
Kalydeco cohort and in the matched Historical cohort were requested to gather further information, 
this has not been done by the MAH. Nevertheless, the request is partially superseded by the results of 
the Interim Analysis 2 which show that sinus disease and pulmonary complications tended to stabilise 
during the second year of treatment in the paediatric population while this was not the case for adult 
patients. Indeed, for adult patients with poor lung function it has been described that increased 
bronchial secretions may warrant increased physiotherapy and intravenous antibiotic treatment when 
ivacaftor is initiated.   
Further, mild to moderate liver enzyme elevations are not uncommon among children with cystic 
fibrosis. Treatment with ivacaftor has been associated with liver function enzymes increase, in 
particular transaminases, which is slightly more frequent in young children than in older subjects. Data 
from study 122 do not suggest that treatment initiation with Kalydeco is associated with an increase in 
hepatobiliary complications. Therefore, no update of the safety profile is necessary. Section 4.8 
adequately described the safety profile in the population less than 18 years of age.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of ivacaftor in patients with R117H-CFTR mutation in study 110 and study 
112 was consistent with the already known safety profile for this medicinal product. The additional 
data presented in study 122 show that the increase seen in sinus disease and pulmonary complications 
during the first year of treatment tended to stabilise during the second 12-month interval in the 
paediatric patients. 
The safety data are limited especially in very young patients, however given the current experience 
and indication in children above 6 months for other mutations, extrapolation of safety from these 
patients is acceptable and support approval in patients with cystic fibrosis and with R117H mutations 
above 6 months of age.  
The SmPC adequately reflects the safety profile for the patient population above 6 months of age in 
patients with cystic fibrosis and with an R117H mutation.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive monogenic disorder affecting approximately 70,000 
individuals worldwide. It is caused by variants in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance 
regulator (CFTR), a cAMP-regulated chloride and bicarbonate channel. CF manifests considerable allelic 
heterogeneity with over 2,000 CFTR variants identified to date and broad clinical variability, rendering 
the relationship between genotype and phenotype difficult to fully elucidate. 
CF greatly affects the paediatric population, as approximately half of the total population with CF is < 
18 years of age. Pancreatic destruction leading to pancreatic exocrine insufficiency begins early in life, 
and lung involvement is manifested by pulmonary inflammation and infection that begins shortly after 
birth. There are published data that support that early treatment (e.g., early nutritional support, 
including pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy and other measures) improves the outcome of 
children with CF. There is therefore an expectation that by treating young children early in life with 
CFTR modulators such as ivacaftor this may have an impact on disease progression and prolong 
survival.  
While severe CFTR genotypes are associated with early-onset pancreatic insufficiency and severe 
respiratory disease, genotypes with one or more residual CFTR function mutation, such as R117H-
CFTR, can initially present with preserved respiratory and pancreatic functions. 
The R117H-CFTR mutation is a missense mutation that results in the replacement of an arginine 
residue at position 117 of CFTR with a histidine residue. The prevalence of the R117H-CFTR mutation 
among individuals with CF is estimated to be 1.0% in Europe and 5.5% in the UK. 
R117H is associated with varying clinical consequences and is influenced by the poly-T status of the 
cis-located intron 8 polythymidine tract. Poly-T tract is present in every copy of the CFTR gene and 
occurs in one of three forms: 5T, 7T, or 9T. Depending on which poly-T form is present, differing 
outcomes may occur. The combination of R117H/5T with a second CF-causing mutation such as 
F508del is expected to result in CF while the combination of R117H/7T is unlikely to act as a disease-
causing variant (particularly for females) but may result in male infertility. However, a person with this 
combination of variants and this form of the poly-T tract may have borderline or elevated sweat 
chloride and mild clinical symptoms of CF. R117H/9T is highly unlikely to act as a disease-causing 
variant and will not lead to CF in the majority of cases. Nevertheless, there may be other genetic and 
environmental factors which may also play a role on the phenotypic expression of the disease in 
individual patients.  
Kalydeco tablets are currently authorised for the treatment of adults aged 18 years and older with 
cystic fibrosis (CF) who have an R117H mutation in the CFTR gene while Kalydeco granules are not yet 
approved for patients with CF and an R117H mutation.  
The aim of the present procedure is the extension of the indication of Kalydeco tablets to children aged 
6 years and above and weighing 25 kg or more with CF who have an R117H mutation in the CFTR 
gene; and to extend the indication of Kalydeco granules to children aged at least 6 months and 
weighing 5 kg to less than 25 kg with CF who have an R117H mutation.  
Dosing recommendations for patients aged 6 months and older:  
Assessment report  
EMA/297262/2020  
Page 110/119 
 
 
 
-  25 mg twice daily for patients weighing between 5 to < 7 kg 
-  50 mg twice daily for patients weighing between 7 kg to <14 kg 
-  75 mg twice daily for patients weighing between 14 kg to <25 kg 
-  150 mg twice daily for patients weighing ≥25 kg 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There is currently no fully effective cure for CF. The majority of CF therapies available including 
nutritional supplements, antibiotics, and mucolytics target the downstream consequences and 
symptoms of the disease. The CFTR modulators such as ivacaftor are small molecules that target the 
functional defect of the mutant CFTR protein. These CFTR modulators are not a cure for CF and must 
be taken chronically for the patient to maintain treatment benefits.  
At present, there are no CFTR modulators approved for the treatment of paediatric subjects with cystic 
fibrosis and with the R117H mutation.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This application corresponds to an extension of the indication of Kalydeco tablets and granules for the 
treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis aged 6 months and older who have an R117H mutation in the 
CFTR gene. It is based on one main clinical study (study VX11-770-110) and two supportive clinical 
studies (study VX11-770-112 and study VX15-770-122). 
Study VX11-770-110 (study 110) is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-
group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ivacaftor in subjects aged 6 years of age and older 
with cystic fibrosis who have the R117H-CFTR mutation. This study was assessed in 
EMEA/H/C/002494/II/27 and led to the granting of an indication for adult patients with an R117H-
CFTR mutation based on a pre-specified subgroup analysis by age. However, the request for 
adolescents (n=2) and children (aged 6 and older, n=17) was rejected.  
Study VX12-770-112 (study 112) is an open-label, rollover study designed to evaluate the safety 
(primary endpoint) and efficacy of long-term (approximately 104 weeks) ivacaftor treatment. This 
study enrolled patients with CF who completed study 110, study 111 (patients with a non-G551D-CFTR 
gating mutation), and study 113 (patients who have phenotypic or molecular evidence of residual CFTR 
function). Interim data (until week 12) and the final study report of study 112 were assessed in 
EMEA/H/C/002494/II/27 and EMEA/H/C/002494/II/0054 respectively. 
Study VX15-770-122 is a non-interventional registry-based study of ivacaftor in patients with the 
R117H-CFTR mutation, aimed at confirming the long-term effectiveness and safety of Kalydeco in both 
paediatric patients (≥2 to <18 years of age) and adults in the US (i.e., in the Cystic Fibrosis 
Foundation Patient Registry, CFFPR).  
Of note, studies in children under 6 years of age with CF who have at least a pre-specified class III 
gating mutations are also relevant for this application because they provide the needed data to support 
extrapolation of PK and safety to CF children below that age with the R117H mutation.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Study 110-patients with R117H mutation: 
Assessment report  
EMA/297262/2020  
Page 111/119 
 
 
 
Adult patients 
In study 110, the mean absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 through week 24 for 
patients ≥18 years of age was greater for the ivacaftor group (4.51 percentage points) than the 
placebo group (-0.46 percentage points). The treatment difference of ivacaftor versus placebo was 
4.96 percentage points (95% CI: 1.15, 8.78). This improvement in ppFEV1 was accompanied by a 
decrease from baseline in sweat chloride (21.87 mmol/l) and by an increase in the respiratory domain 
of the pooled Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) above the minimal clinically important 
difference (mean treatment difference was 12.64 points). The response was larger in subjects with the 
R117H-5T variant than in subjects with the R117H-7T variant with a treatment difference of ivacaftor 
vs. placebo at week 24 of 6.87 pp (95% CI: 2.19, 11.56) favouring ivacaftor.  
Adolescents (n=2) 
Only two adolescents were enrolled in study 110 and rolled over into study 112. In study 112, at week 
84, the mean (SD) change from baseline in ppFEV1 was 5.8 (4.9) percentage points and decreased to 
2.6 (6.4) at the earlier termination visit. No issues of concern were identified in either study 110 or 
study 112 but overall definitive conclusions on efficacy could not be reached based on the small 
number of paediatric patients.   
Children from 6 to 11 years (n=17) 
A relevant mean reduction in sweat chloride levels was seen in all age subgroups in the ivacaftor arm, 
including 6 to 11 years of age (-26.59 mmol/L) in comparison with 1.04 mmol/L for the placebo group. 
Further, mean sweat chloride reduction was detected by Week 2 (first post-baseline time point 
assessed; -25.22 mmol/L) and were sustained through Week 24. The magnitude of the mean 
reduction was very similar to that of subjects ≥18 years of age in the ivacaftor arm. Treatment 
differences at all time points where sweat chloride levels were determined favoured ivacaftor. 
Study 112 (Follow up of study 110) - Children from 6 to 11 years (n = 10) 
Thirteen children rolled over from study 110 into study 112. Their mean baseline ppFEV1 was 90.7 
percentage points. Children from study 110 experienced a mean (SE) absolute change in ppFEV1 of 
4.0 percentage points (2.5) and 8.6 percentage points (3.2) at week 48 (n=10) and week 96 (n=5) 
respectively. Results from study 112 in children were reassuring in that the seemingly deteriorating 
effect in ppFEV1 seen in study 110 was not seen in this age group at a longer duration of exposure.  
Similarly, a response in the respiratory domain of CFQ-R was observed at almost all time points in 
study 112. Changes from baseline in the 6 to 11 years of age subgroup remained above the MCID at 
almost all time points and ranged from 3.2 to 10.3 points. 
Study 122 (Non interventional study) – Adults and paediatric patients aged 2 to less than 18 years: 
In study 122 in the Kalydeco cohort for ‘paediatric patients aged 6 to <18 years’, the mean (SD) 
ppFEV1 increased from pre-treatment baseline during the first 12 months of Kalydeco treatment (1.1 
[7.2]); this increase was maintained in the second (0.5 [9.1]) 12-month interval after treatment 
initiation among patients who had available data in the respective intervals. The percentage of patients 
with at least one pulmonary exacerbation was reduced from 10.1% (12-month pre-treatment) to 6.9% 
(24 months post-treatment). Similarly, the mean number of pulmonary exacerbations changed from 
0.13 to 0.07 in these two periods. For ‘children aged 2 years to less than 6 years’, these figures were 
10.8% and 0.15 pre-treatment and 8.6% and 0.12 post-treatment. The prevalence of pancreatitis 
decreased in paediatric patients aged ≥6 to less than 18 years (from 6.1% pre-treatment to 2.3% 
during the second 12-month interval post-treatment) and in adults (10.5% pre-treatment to 7.3% 
post-treatment).   
Assessment report

Page 112/119 
 
 
 
Extrapolation of efficacy from adults to the paediatric population has been accepted based on 1) similar 
systemic exposure as in adults or older paediatric patients at the selected doses, 2) the mechanism of 
action of ivacaftor which acts similarly in adults and paediatric patients, 3) a similar response in sweat 
chloride and 4) on the pathogenesis of the disease although there may be significant age-dependency 
for the presence of certain symptoms and signs of the disease or showing a different pattern of organ 
damage.  
Overall, the main clinical study in adults with R117H mutations and in particular the positive sweat 
chloride results along with the well-established PK for ivacaftor in the adolescents and children 
population support extrapolation of efficacy to younger patients <18 years of age with R117H 
mutation. Additionally, the post marketing experience in children with the R117H-CFTR mutation 
outside EU provide supportive data. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The very low number of subjects involved in the main pivotal study (study 110) was a limitation 
especially in the younger age of the group. In study 110, 17 children (8 patients on placebo; 9 on 
ivacaftor) and 2 adolescents (one in each group) were enrolled.  
In children aged 6 to 11 years (inclusive), the mean ppFEV1 was >93% for both treatment groups at 
all time points. While the mean ppFEV1 for the placebo group at baseline was 93.98 pp, the mean 
during the treatment period ranged from 97.36 (Week 2) to 99.10 pp (Week 8). The mean ppFEV1 for 
the ivacaftor group at baseline was 97.49 pp and ranged from 93.46 pp (Week 2) to 99.01 pp (Week 
8) during the treatment period.  
In these children, the mean treatment difference for the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 was 
-6.3 percentage points (95% CI: -11.96, -0.71) favouring the placebo group. With the exception of the 
sweat chloride response, no other meaningful clinical responses to ivacaftor treatment (i.e., 
anthropometric parameters, respiratory domain score of the CFQ-R questionnaire, and pulmonary 
exacerbations) were seen in children. In this age group, the ppFEV1 treatment difference favoured 
placebo, which the MAH interpreted as a spurious result driven by an unusual placebo response and 
generally no or minimal change in FEV1 in the ivacaftor group. In spite of that, the indication in the EU 
was restricted to adults with cystic fibrosis who have the R117H-CFTR mutation.    
There are certain limitations with study 112, in particular the clinical design of such study (uncontrolled 
study) as well as the very small number of paediatric patients (n=15) who rolled over from study 110 
and which was further decreased towards the end of the study as patients were transferred to 
commercial drug. Based on the inherent limitations of non-randomised studies, the results of study 
112 should therefore be interpreted with caution.   
Results for the age group from 6 to less than 18 years of age are presented together in study 122. 
However, compared to children, adolescents are at a higher risk of lung function decline. The lack of 
comparative matched cohort data provide limitation to the results. Indeed, demographic and disease 
characteristics at baseline for children (6 to 12 years of age) and for adolescents in specific subsets of 
cohorts was not satisfactorily addressed by the MAH despite the request by CHMP. Further, patients in 
the Historical cohort could not be matched to those in the Kalydeco cohort which limits the accuracy of 
the conclusions that can be reached by comparing these two cohorts.  
In addition, for study 122, use of a historical cohort from an earlier time period may be biased by the 
different standards of care and by potential differences in the CF population over time. In this respect, 
for the outcome measures of PEx, sinus disease, pulmonary complications and prevalence of P 
aeruginosa, patients in the Kalydeco cohort in the pre-treatment period showed, in general, worse 
Assessment report

Page 113/119 
 
 
 
outcomes (i.e., higher frequency) than those of the Historical cohort. Possible explanations of the 
unusual worse outcomes of the Kalydeco cohort in comparison to Historical cohort include 1) changes 
in the standard of care of CF patients over time as well as changes in registry data collection practices 
over time; 2) the lower frequency of visits in the historical period which may explain also the lower 
recorded frequency of select outcome measures compared to the pre-treatment period in the Kalydeco 
Cohort; and 3) channelling bias or confounding by indication, where sicker patients would be more 
likely to initiate Kalydeco therapy. The channelling bias, in particular, appears a likely factor that may 
contribute to the above finding. 
Further, the impact of missing data which may introduce misclassification of exposure and outcomes 
data as well as the potential confounding by indication may be of concern as patients treated with 
Kalydeco may be systematically different and have different risk factors than patients who are not 
treated. Although more robust data have been presented with the request for supplementary 
information in the form of an additional interim analysis (IA2) covering until 24 months (and for a 
number of patients until 36) of follow-up under ivacaftor treatment the above concerns cannot be 
ignored. In addition, the prevalence of certain cystic fibrosis complications is lower in the paediatric 
population than in adults which may make it difficult to accurately capture them.   
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The overall comparative safety database of paediatric patients with an R117H mutation is small and 
limited to children aged 6 years and older. Children below that age have not been enrolled in clinical 
studies. Due to the very limited safety data especially in very young patients, safety is extrapolated 
from patients with gating (class III) mutations enrolled in study 108 and study 124.  
In study 110, the adverse events with the highest incidence in both treatment groups were infective 
pulmonary exacerbations of CF and cough. Treatment AEs with at least 5% higher incidence with 
ivacaftor compared to placebo included nasal congestion, oropharyngeal pain, abdominal pain, 
wheezing, upper airway cough syndrome, bacterial disease carrier, influenza-like illness, and 
abdominal discomfort. All of them have been reported in prior studies and are included in section 4.8 
of the SmPC. Lens opacities, which are of concern in the paediatric population, were not reported in 
study 110.  
Nevertheless, results of the safety assessment indicated that ivacaftor was well tolerated. Further, 
analysis of the occurrence of AEs and SAEs, including events of special interest, laboratory parameters, 
safety data in special populations, etc., did not reveal major differences with the known safety profile 
of ivacaftor.  
In study 112, an increase in blood pressure without clinical relevance was identified. No changes to the 
PI were deemed necessary. This safety concern is currently monitored in the post-marketing setting as 
part of PSURs. 
Treatment with ivacaftor has been associated with liver function enzymes increase, in particular 
transaminases, which is slightly more frequent in young children than in older subjects. Data from 
study 122 do not suggest that treatment initiation with Kalydeco is associated with an increase in 
hepatobiliary complications which is reassuring.  
Three deaths (one in a young paediatric patient and two in adults) have been reported in the Kalydeco 
cohort of study 122. 
In study 122 an observed increase in sinus disease and pulmonary complications in the Kalydeco 
cohort was observed consistent with the chronic and progressive nature of CF. Interim Analysis 2 
results showed that sinus disease and pulmonary complications stabilised during the second year of 
Assessment report  
EMA/297262/2020  
Page 114/119 
 
 
 
treatment in the paediatric population while this was not the case for adult patients. Trends in other 
chronic complications in paediatric patients including distal intestinal obstruction syndrome and 
hepatobiliary complications, showed no discernible patterns.  
Patients with classical cystic fibrosis disease have a high incidence of chronic rhinosinusitis, therefore 
the increased frequency of sinus disease and pulmonary complications with ivacaftor (Kalydeco cohort) 
observed in the three age groups could be linked with the chronic, progressive nature of CF.  Some of 
the common adverse events described for ivacaftor overlap with the classical symptoms of 
rhinosinusitis such as rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction, mouth breathing, and headache. The interim 
analysis (IA2) covering 24 months (36 months follow-up for some patients) showed that sinus disease 
and pulmonary complications tended to stabilise over time in the two paediatric age groups but not in 
adult patients. However, it cannot be ruled out that treatment with ivacaftor may also be contributing 
to the increased incidence of these complications. The MAH did not provide comparative data in 
specific datasets of subjects in the Kalydeco cohort and in the matched Historical cohort as requested 
by CHMP to allow firm conclusion.  
Post-marketing exposure in patients less than 18 years of age represents approximately 30% of 
overall post-marketing exposure (about 17,000 person-years). The safety data from post-marketing 
experiences were consistent with data from clinical studies, including the 5-year post-authorization 
safety study (PASS), and are also consistent between patients 18 years of age and older and patients 
less than 18 years of age. 
Overall, no update of the safety profile is necessary and section 4.8 adequately describes the safety 
profile in the paediatric population less than 18 years of age.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The number of children aged 6 to 11 years of age and adolescents with an R117H mutation for which 
comparative (24 weeks) safety data are available from study 110 is very small (n=19) to allow an 
appropriate characterisation of the safety profile of ivacaftor. Longer-term safety data have been 
generated in study 112 only in 15 of these patients. Further, the only data available for children aged 2 
to less 6 years of age who have the R117H mutation come from the observational study 122 which is a 
non-interventional study based on the secondary use of data and thus reporting of suspected adverse 
reactions as individual case safety reports is not required which limits the availability of safety data in 
paediatric patients with CF and an R117H mutation.  
Further, study 122 is a registry-based observational study and therefore has inherent limitations such 
as the potential impact of missing data which may introduce misclassification of exposure and 
outcomes data as well as the potential confounding by indication which is also of concern as patients 
treated with Kalydeco may be systematically different and have different risk factors than patients who 
are not treated.  
The higher frequency of pulmonary exacerbations, sinus disease, pulmonary complications and 
prevalence of P aeruginosa, at the beginning and even at the end of the 3-year follow-up period (for 
some patients) observed in the Kalydeco cohort compared to the Historical cohort would not be 
expected as historical cohorts usually show worse outcomes than more recent ones as standard of care 
improves over time. It is reassuring, however, that the records of treatment discontinuation during the 
first year post-treatment in study 122 for the overall population of the Kalydeco cohort were small 
(i.e., 9.5%) which suggests that these complications could be managed. Potential explanations for the 
observed numeric differences could be due to changes in the standard of care of CF patients as well as 
changes in registry data collection practices over time; lower frequency of visits in the historical period 
(leading to a  lower recorded frequency of outcome measures) compared to the pre-treatment period 
Assessment report  
EMA/297262/2020  
Page 115/119 
 
 
 
in the Kalydeco Cohort; and channelling bias or confounding by indication, where sicker patients would 
be more likely to initiate Kalydeco therapy. All of them, but particularly the channelling bias, appear 
likely factors that may contribute to the above finding. 
No safety data are available for children under 2 years of age who have the R117H-CFTR mutation. 
Safety, in this case, is extrapolated from children with class III gating mutations enrolled in study 124 
(below 2 years of age).  
3.6.  Effects Table 
The only study which has not been previously assessed is study 122, a non-interventional registry-
based study. As such, reporting of suspected adverse reactions as individual case safety reports is not 
required and therefore, no effects table could be provided.  
3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
A consistent effect in sweat chloride has been observed in all age subgroups in the pivotal study 110. 
 A relevant mean reduction in sweat chloride levels was seen in all age subgroups in the ivacaftor arm, 
including 6 to 11 years of age (-26.59 mmol/L) in comparison with 1.04 mmol/L for the placebo group. 
Further, mean sweat chloride reduction was detected by Week 2 (first post-baseline time point 
assessed; -25.22 mmol/L) and were sustained through Week 24. The magnitude of the mean 
reduction was very similar to that of subjects ≥18 years of age in the ivacaftor arm. Treatment 
differences at all time points where sweat chloride levels were determined favoured ivacaftor. 
The principles of extrapolation apply in what refers to the systemic exposure in children, observed to 
be within the range of adult systemic exposure to efficacy as well as on the similar reduction in sweat 
chloride observed in study 110 across all age groups in the ivacaftor arm.  
Clinical efficacy data are provided in adult, adolescents, and children patients with R117H mutation 
from studies 110, 112 and 122. These data provide some support of clinical efficacy in children above 
2 years of age.  Results from study 112 in children aged 6 to less than 12 years (n=15) were 
reassuring in that the seemingly deteriorating effect in ppFEV1 seen in study 110 was not kept in this 
age group at a longer duration of exposure. As for study 122, the second interim analysis in paediatric 
patients less than 18 years old provides reassurance in terms also of ppFEV1 as well as pulmonary 
exacerbations.  
From a safety perspective, the database of paediatric subjects enrolled in study 110 and study 112, is 
small but further reassurance on the safety profile across age groups is obtained from children of the 
same age with gating (class III) mutations as well as by post-marketing data. The limitation in terms 
of size is particularly evident for very young children as safety data is available for 25 patients between 
12 months to less than 24 months of age and 14 patients between 6 to less than 12 months of age 
with class III gating mutations).  
An increase in sinus disease and pulmonary complications was seen in all subjects in the Kalydeco 
cohort of study 122 during the first-year post-treatment initiation but tended to stabilise in the 
paediatric population over time which seems reassuring. Sinus disease and pulmonary complications 
will be further reviewed as part of the final study report for study 122 expected to be finalised by 
December 2020. 
Assessment report

Overall, results of the safety assessment indicated that ivacaftor was well tolerated and consistent with 
the known safety profile of ivacaftor.  
The safety data from post-marketing experiences were consistent with data from clinical studies, 
including the 5-year post-authorization safety study (PASS), and similar between adults and paediatric 
patients less than 18 years of age.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
This application is based on clinical PK, efficacy, and safety data in paediatric patients with an R117H 
mutation. The PK of ivacaftor is well understood and is consistent across genotypes and among age 
ranges down to 6 months of age based on completed studies. 
Taking into consideration that genotype was not identified as a relevant covariate explaining variability 
of ivacaftor pharmacokinetics and the safety profile was overall similar and acceptable across age 
groups and genotypes, the approved posology for children aged 6 months (weighing at least 5 kg) and 
older with CF who have a (pre-specified) gating (class III) mutation in the CFTR gene is considered to 
be also applicable to children of the same age and body weight with CF who have an R117H-CFTR 
mutation. 
Extrapolation of efficacy from adults has been the principle on which ivacaftor has been approved for 
children younger than 6 years of age with some pre-specified gating (class III mutations) based on 
single arm studies assessing the PK and safety of ivacaftor with efficacy endpoints collected as 
secondary endpoints. The same approach is proposed for children with the R117H mutation. 
Interim data from the non-interventional registry-based study 122 provide further reassurance that the 
use of ivacaftor may be of benefit for paediatric patients in terms of lung function (ppFEV1), 
pulmonary exacerbations, P. aeruginosa lung colonisation, and pancreatitis to which patients with the 
R117H mutation may be prone to.  
The results of the safety assessment indicated that ivacaftor was well tolerated and that the safety 
findings were consistent with the known safety profile of ivacaftor.  Even though the paediatric safety 
database in paediatric patients with this CFTR variant is very limited (children aged 6 years and older 
and adolescents) or even non-existing (children under 6 years of age), safety data can be extrapolated 
from children of the same age range with gating mutations based on similar systemic exposure which 
is not expected to be influenced on the basis of a different genotype. 
The safety data from post-marketing experiences were consistent with data from clinical studies, 
including the 5-year post-authorization safety study (PASS), and similar between adults and paediatric 
patients less than 18 years of age. Additional safety data in the younger population are expected to be 
generated by the ongoing open-label study 126 (a phase 3, 2-arm, open-label study to evaluate the 
safety and PD of long-term IVA treatment in subjects with CF who are less than 24 months of age at 
treatment initiation and have an approved IVA-responsive mutation). The final CSR of study 126 is 
expected to be completed by March 2022 to provide further data to characterise the safety profile of 
ivacaftor in these young children. 
In patients with the R117H mutation, the diagnosis of CF may be particularly challenging but once the 
diagnosis is confirmed these children are followed and managed as classical CF. Given that the 
biochemical defect in the CFTR conductance channel is present from birth and although the disease can 
take many years to become manifested in full, there is evidence of respiratory and other organ 
involvement since birth even if there may not be overt disease manifestations that can be captured by 
the usual clinical endpoints. Therefore, the present extension of the indication of Kalydeco will allow 
Assessment report  
EMA/297262/2020  
Page 117/119 
 
 
 
treatment initiation at a young age as this may modify the progress of the disease by correction, or at 
least by improvement of the biochemical defect.    
The approval of Kalydeco for the treatment of paediatric patients down to 6 months of age with cystic 
fibrosis and who have the R117H-CFTR mutation will cover an existing unmet medical need.  
In asymptomatic young children diagnosis of cystic fibrosis requires genetic analysis (including the 
poly-T status) and sweat chloride determination. Currently most infants detected on newborn 
screening with an R117H-7T will not fulfil CF diagnostic criteria and will remain asymptomatic. 
However, there are cases reported with the CF disease.  
As a consequence, the CHMP considered that the indication should be kept broad to allow treatment to 
patients with an R117H-CFTR mutation who have cystic fibrosis without restricting the poly-T variant. 
Therefore, the previous precautionary statement in section 4.4 of the SmPC has been removed while 
information about the need to confirm the genotype (if not already available from the clinical records 
of patients) before starting treatment with ivacaftor as well as to determine the phase of the poly-T 
variant is kept in section 4.2. 
In conclusion, the data support an extension of the indication in patients with CF who have an R117H 
mutation from 6 months of age. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Kalydeco for the treatment of paediatric patients down to 6 months of age and 
weighing 5 kg with cystic fibrosis and who have the R117H-CFTR mutation is positive.

Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annexes I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0353/2018 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Kalydeco is not similar to Bronchitol (mannitol), TOBI 
Podhaler (tobramycin inhalation powder) and Symkevi (tezacaftor/ivacaftor) within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. CHMP AR on similarity dated 30

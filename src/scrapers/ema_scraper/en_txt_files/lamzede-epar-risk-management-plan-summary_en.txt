Part VI-Summary of activities in the risk management plan   
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for velmanase alfa (CHF-LMZYMAA1). 
The RMP details important risks of velmanase alfa (CHF-LMZYMAA1), how these risks can be minimised, 
and  how  more  information  will  be  obtained  velmanase  alfa  (CHF-LMZYMAA1)'s  risks  and  uncertainties 
(missing information). 
Velmanase  alfa  (CHF-LMZYMAA1)'s  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet 
give  essential  information  to  healthcare  professionals  and  patients  on  how  velmanase  alfa  (CHF-
LMZYMAA1) should be used. 
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for? 
Velmanase  alfa  (CHF-LMZYMAA1)  is  an  enzyme  replacement  therapy  for  the  treatment  of  non-
neurological manifestations in patients with mild to moderate alpha-mannosidosis.   
II.   Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks  
Important risks of velmanase alfa (CHF-LMZYMAA1), together with measures to minimise such risks and 
the proposed studies for learning more about velmanase alfa (CHF-LMZYMAA1)’ risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
• Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package leaflet and 
SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
• The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the medicine is used 
correctly; 
• The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or without prescription) 
can help to minimise its risks.  
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
If  important  information  that  may  affect  the  safe  use  of  velmanase  alfa  (CHF-LMZYMAA1)  is  not  yet 
available, it is listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A  List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of velmanase alfa (CHF-LMZYMAA1) are risks that need special risk management activities 
to further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important risks 
can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a 
link with the use of velmanase alfa (CHF-LMZYMAA1). Potential risks are concerns for which an association 
with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established 
yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to  information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal 
product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

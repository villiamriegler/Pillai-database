See Annex A 
The following variation was requested: 
Variation requested 
Type 
C.1.6 a 
Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of 
II 
an approved one 
The MAH applied for a new indication for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative 
colitis in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including 
corticosteroids and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have 
medical contraindications for such therapies. Consequently, the MAH proposed the update of sections 
4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 of the SmPC.  
The Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated in accordance. 
The variation proposed amendments to the SmPC and Package Leaflet. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0106/2012 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0106/2012 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
Scientific advice 
The applicant did not seek scientific advice at the CHMP.

TNFα is considered a key inflammatory mediator that exhibits a wide variety of functional activities. 
Abnormally high levels of TNFα have been implicated in the pathophysiology of several immune-
mediated diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and ankylosing 
spondylitis (AS). Binding of TNFα by an anti-TNFα antibody prevents the target from binding to cell 
surface TNFα receptors and consequently prevents downstream signalling cascades and the deleterious 
effects of inappropriate or excessive TNFα expression.

In  the  EU,  Simponi  is  available  as  a  50  mg  Solution  for  injection  in  prefilled  Pen  and  Solution  for 
injection in prefilled syringe and is to be administered subcutaneously. The approved indications are: 
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
Simponi, in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for: 
-  the  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe,  active  rheumatoid  arthritis  in  adults  when  the  response  to 
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy including MTX has been inadequate. 
- the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously treated 
with MTX. 
Simponi, in combination with MTX, has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage 
as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function. 
Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) 
Simponi,  alone  or  in  combination  with  MTX,  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  active  and  progressive 
psoriatic  arthritis  in  adult  patients  when  the  response  to  previous  disease-modifying  anti-rheumatic 
drug  (DMARD)  therapy  has  been  inadequate.  Simponi  has  been  shown  to  reduce  the  rate  of 
progression of peripheral joint damage as measured by X-ray in patients with polyarticular symmetrical 
subtypes of the disease (see section 5.1) and to improve physical function. 
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) 
Simponi  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  severe,  active  ankylosing  spondylitis  in  adults  who  have 
responded inadequately to conventional therapy. 
This Type II variation application has been submitted to seek approval of a new therapeutic indication 
for golimumab i.e. “treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult patients who 
have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and 
6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have medical 
contraindications for such therapies”. 
The application is based on the results of one induction study C0524T17 and of one maintenance 
study, C0524T18. A long-term extension of study C0524T18 is ongoing through week 228. 
A second induction study, study C0524T16, was stopped due to lack of efficacy of single IV induction 
doses as compared with SC induction in study C0524T17. Efficacy results from this study are not used 
for support of the UC indication, although PK and safety data from the study is presented. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
On 20th June 2013, the MAH informed the CHMP about misconduct at one study site (site 7407). The 
CHMP therefore asked the MAH to submit results from all analyses of importance for the evaluation of 
the efficacy and safety of Simponi in the new indication, comparing the initial study population and the 
population where these subjects were omitted. Further to this assessment the MAH excluded efficacy 
data from 10 of 771 patients in the original primary analysis population of the induction study and 
from 7 of 463 the original primary analysis population of the maintenance study. The new analyses 
Simponi 
Assessment report  
EMA/640422/2013 
Page 6/60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
show that the overall effects of removing the data from this site affect the key efficacy outcomes by 0-
1%. The CHMP therefore concluded that data from the new analyses do not change the conclusions on 
the efficacy results.  
The MAH performed additional source data monitoring at seventeen (17) high-enrolling sites in order 
to assess if further audits were necessary. These sites were chosen based on a risk-assessment 
algorithm developed by the MAH. The monitoring visits included a thorough assessment of source data 
for all key efficacy outcomes including a review of the Mayo diary cards, Mayo score calculation, and 
endoscopy reports at each site. No further cases of misconduct or data integrity issues were identified. 
Therefore, additional audits were not considered necessary. 
At CHMP’s request The MAH also confirmed that previously identified non-compliance issues related to 
the Simponi UC program, including misconduct, were thoroughly investigated and described in the 
CSRs submitted with this application. The types of observations found at site 7407 were not observed 
at any other sites in the program.

Tabular overview of clinical studies  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The role of pharmacokinetics in this application was to describe the PK of the new dose level (100 mg) 
and the new patient group (UC).  
Pharmacokinetic sampling was performed in all three studies performed in UC: 
Simponi 
Assessment report  
EMA/640422/2013 
Page 7/60 
 
 
 
 
- C0524T16 IV induction study  
- C0524T17 SC induction study 
- C0524T18 SC maintenance study 
The studies and results are described below. The data was also used to perform a population PK 
analysis.  
In addition, four phase I studies (CNTO148NAP1001, C0524T23, C0524T15 and C0524T14) in healthy 
volunteers and RA patients are referred to. 
Introduction 
The doses for the clinical studies in UC were chosen based on clinical data of infliximab and knowledge 
about the relative potency of infliximab and golimumab, since the use of infliximab is already 
established in UC.  
Phase 2/3 studies in UC 
•  Analytical methods 
Serum golimumab concentrations were measured using an electrochemiluminescent immunoassay 
(ECLIA), in two versions, a bead-based method on a BioVeris platform in C0524T23 and C0524T15, 
and a plate-based method on a Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) platform in C0524T14, CNTO148NAP1001, 
C0524T16, C0524T17, and C0524T18. The BioVeris assay has been assessed previously. The MSD 
method has shown comparable results to the BioVeris assay, when analysing incurred study samples 
and controls using the ECLIA (MSD) assay, 54 of the 60 samples were within ± 30% of the 
corresponding BioVeris ECLIA results. 
•  Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
A population PK analysis was performed to characterize the PK of golimumab and evaluate the 
influences of subject demographic characteristics and other intrinsic or extrinsic factors on the 
disposition of golimumab in subjects with UC. 
•  Study design 
C0524T16 was a Phase 2/3 multicenter, dose-ranging (Part 1), dose-confirming (Part 2), randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of the safety and efficacy of IV induction 
regimens of golimumab in subjects with moderately to severely active UC. Doses of 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, 
4 mg/kg or placebo were administered at Week 0. At study termination, a total of 291 subjects had 
been randomized to treatment, 214 subjects to golimumab (62, 75, and 77 subjects to the 1 mg/kg, 2 
mg/kg, and 4 mg/kg groups, respectively) and 77 subjects to placebo. Serum samples for the 
measurement of golimumab concentrations were drawn before and 1 hour after a single golimumab 
infusion was administered at Week 0. Samples were also collected at Weeks 2, 4, and 6. An additional 
sample was collected 16 weeks after the last administration of study agent for subjects who terminated 
the study and did not continue into the maintenance study (C0524T18).  
C0524T17 was a Phase 2/3 multicenter, dose-ranging (Part 1), dose-confirming (Part 2), randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of the safety and efficacy of SC induction 
regimens of golimumab in subjects with moderately to severely active UC. Doses of 100 mg and 50 
mg, 200 mg and 100 mg or 400 mg and 200 mg or placebo were administered at Week 0 and Week 2 
respectively. A total of 1,065 subjects were randomized to treatment, 734 subjects to golimumab (72, 
331, and 331 subjects to 100 mg and 50 mg, 200 mg and 100 mg, and 400 mg and 200 mg, 
Simponi 
Assessment report

respectively) and 331 subjects to placebo. Serum samples for the measurement of golimumab 
concentrations were collected before drug administration at Weeks 0 and 2. Samples were also 
collected at Weeks 4 and 6. An additional sample was collected 16 weeks after the last administration 
of study agent for subjects who terminated the study and did not continue into the maintenance study 
(C0524T18).  
C0524T18 was a Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to evaluate 
the safety and efficacy of golimumab maintenance therapy, administered subcutaneously, in subjects 
with moderately to severely active UC. Doses of 50 mg, 100 mg or placebo were administered every 4 
weeks through Week 52. A total of 464 subjects were randomized to treatment, 308 subjects to 
golimumab (154, and 154 subjects to 50 mg and 100 mg, respectively) and 156 subjects to placebo. 
Subjects who achieved clinical response with golimumab in an induction study (i.e., randomized 
subjects) but who subsequently lost clinical response at any time during C0524T18 were eligible for a 
single dose adjustment through Week 52. Serum samples for the measurement of golimumab 
concentrations were collected prior to study agent administration at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 20, 28, 36 and 
44. Additional samples were also collected at a visit between Weeks 16 and 24 and at Weeks 30 and 
54. 
•  Study results 
Study C0524T16 
In this study, golimumab was administered intravenously at three different dose levels (1, 2 and 4 
mg/kg). It was prematurely stopped because of better results from the SC induction study 
(C0524T17), but included 291 subjects. Serum PK samples were collected at each scheduled visit 
through week 6. 
Figure 1 Median serum golimumab concentration over 6 weeks after a single IV dose of Simponi 1 (n=63), 2 (n=74) and 
4m (n=76) mg/kg. 
The median serum golimumab levels at 6 weeks were 0.16, 0.56 and 1.40 µg/ml after single dose IV 
administration of 1, 2 and 4 mg/kg, respectively. 27% of the patients receiving 1 mg/ml, 11% 
receiving 2 mg/kg and none in the high dose group had undetectable levels (<0.03905 μg/ml) at week 
6. None of the patients were positive for golimumab antibodies.  
Study C0524T17 
In this study, golimumab was administered SC on week 0 and week 2 at three different dose levels 
(100 mg + 50 mg, 200 mg + 100 mg, 400 mg + 200 mg). Serum PK samples were collected at each 
scheduled visit through week 6.

(n=71), 200+100 (n=331) and 400+200 (n=332) mg. 
The median serum golimumab levels at 6 weeks were 0.78, 1.78 and 4.01 μg/ml after 2 SC doses of 
100+50, 200+100 and 400+200 mg, respectively. Very few patients had undetectable levels 
(<0.03905 μg/ml) at week 6 (3.4%, 0.3%, and 0.4%). Of the 721 patients, 3 were positive for 
golimumab antibodies.  
Study C0524T18 
Steady state was judged to be reached at week 8 (14 weeks from start of induction) and the steady 
state level was approximately dose proportional (at week 8-44, median drug concentration was 0.69-
0.83 μg/ml in the 50 mg dose group and 1.33-1.58 μg/ml in the 100 mg group). Median plasma levels 
for randomized subjects who had received the 200 + 100 mg SC induction are shown in Figure 3.  
Figure 3 Median serum golimumab concentrations (ug/ml) through week 54 of the maintenance study (C0524T18) from 
week 0 of the induction study (T17) in randomized patients with 200+100 mg SC induction. 
At Week 8 of C0524T18, median pre-administration serum golimumab concentrations in subjects who 
were randomized to placebo from the SC golimumab induction treatment groups were either low (0.39 
μg/mL in the 400 mg → 200 mg and 0.08 μg/mL 200 mg → 100 mg groups) or below the limit of 
quantification (golimumab 100 mg → 50 mg group). In subjects who were randomized to golimumab 
100 mg, the median pre-administration serum golimumab concentrations at Week 8 were 1.54 μg/mL, 
1.60 μg/mL, and 1.14 μg/mL for subjects receiving golimumab SC induction at 400 mg → 200 mg, 200 
mg → 100 mg, or 100 mg → 50 mg, respectively. In subjects who were randomized to golimumab 50 
mg, the median pre-administration serum golimumab concentrations at Week 8 were 1.01 μg/mL, 
0.85μg/mL, and 0.60 μg/mL for subjects receiving golimumab SC induction at 400 mg → 200 mg, 200 
mg → 100 mg, or 100 mg → 50 mg, respectively. In general, steady state was reached approximately 
8 weeks after maintenance doses were initiated (i.e., 14 weeks after the start of induction treatment) 
in randomized subjects from the SC induction treatment groups.

Effect of Immunomodulator Use on Serum Golimumab Concentration 
Of the 308 subjects in C0524T18 randomized to golimumab, 30.8% (95 subjects) were receiving 
immunomodulators at Week 0 of induction (30.2% receiving 6-MP or AZA and 0.6% receiving MTX), 
and 69.2% (213 subjects) were not receiving immunomodulators (C0524T18 54-week CSR\Tab2). 
Median serum golimumab concentrations for randomized subjects receiving golimumab 100 mg were 
comparable irrespective of baseline immunomodulator use status while median serum golimumab 
concentrations were slightly but consistently higher across all time points in subjects receiving 
golimumab 50 mg in combination with immunomodulators compared to those in subjects receiving 
golimumab 50 mg without immunomodulator use. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population (popPK analysis of data from subjects with 
UC) 
Serum golimumab concentration-time data was analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling 
methods (NONMEM with FOCE-I). The objectives of the analysis were to quantify population PK model 
parameters including typical values and random variability and identify covariates which significantly 
influence golimumab pharmacokinetics in subjects with UC. 
The analysis was conducted with data from two induction studies (C0524T16 and C0524T17) and 
one maintenance study (C0524T18) in subjects with UC. A total of 11,280 serum golimumab 
concentrations from 1,227 UC subjects were included in the population PK analysis. There were ten 
outlier samples excluded from the analysis. In the population PK dataset, serum golimumab 
concentrations below limit of quantification (BLQ) were replaced with half of the lower limit of 
quantification (LLOQ). For this population PK analysis, the first post dose BLQ data within a dosing 
interval was included in the analysis, while BLQ data in a sample prior to the first administration of the 
drug along with trailing BLQ data were excluded from the final PopPK data set. Thus, all available BLQ 
data were not included in the calculation of % BLQ. Of the 11,280 serum golimumab concentration 
samples in the final population PK analysis dataset, 590 samples (5.2%) were BLQ. These samples 
were associated with the first BLQ samples within a dosing interval and were set to half of the LLOQ 
value for the population PK analysis; however, trailing BLQ samples (n= 572) were excluded from the 
analysis data set. 
All significant covariates identified in previous population PK analyses of golimumab including: 
• 
body weight, 
•  C-reactive protein (CRP), 
• 
• 
• 
antibody to golimumab status, 
smoking status, 
subject’s sex 
were assessed for influence on the PK variability of golimumab. In addition, the following covariates 
were assessed:  
• 
• 
• 
body surface area, 
lean body mass, 
age, 
Simponi 
Assessment report  
EMA/640422/2013 
Page 11/60 
 
 
 
• 
albumin, 
•  white blood cell count, 
• 
• 
estimated creatinine clearance, 
hepatic enzymes, 
•  Mayo score, 
• 
• 
• 
disease duration, 
race (Caucasians versus non-Caucasians, Japanese versus non- Japanese), 
concomitant use of immunomodulators (azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine/ or methotrexate, 
AZA/6-MP or MTX). 
In general, baseline values of the covariates were used in modeling with the exception of antibody to 
golimumab status or where otherwise specified. Continuous covariates were normalized to the 
approximate median or selected reference value of the respective covariate as determined from the 
dataset. Categorical covariates were entered into the model using index variables (0 or 1) and as a 
fractional change relative to the reference group (usually assigned a 0). Empirical Bayesian estimates 
(EBEs) were generated from the estimation step in NONMEM. An exploratory graphical evaluation of 
covariate- parameter relationships was performed. The shrinkages of PK parameters were taken into 
consideration while assessing plots based on EBEs. A trend between a covariate and a PK parameter 
led to direct assessment in NONMEM. Final covariate model selection was conducted using a stepwise 
backward elimination procedure starting with the “full” covariate model. If the effects of two covariates 
were highly correlated (r>0.7), it was not considered appropriate to incorporate both covariates on the 
same parameter in the full model. In such a case, the variable with the highest significance (i.e., 
largest decrease in objective function value (OFV) from the base model), or better clinical utility was 
used. In the event that highly correlated covariates were identified for different model parameters 
(e.g. body weight on CL and body surface area on V2), only one of the correlated covariates was 
included on the different model parameters. 
General goodness-of-fit of the final PK model was evaluated by examining a variety of diagnostic and 
summary graphics. Model stability was tested through the evaluation of the condition number. The 
covariance step was implemented with each NONMEM run and standard errors for parameter 
estimates, along with correlations between parameters, were evaluated. A nonparametric bootstrap 
approach was used to compute confidence intervals for the PK parameters. 
Supporting phase 1 studies 
The applicant is also referring to four phase I studies with rich PK sampling. 
CNTO148NAP1001 (completed April 2011) was comparing a single SC dose of golimumab (200 or 
400 mg) in male Caucasian (n=24) and Japanese (n=25) subjects. Similar mean AUC and half life 
were observed in the two ethnic groups. The mean AUC inf in Caucasians was 246 ug.day/ml after the 
200 mg dose and 535 ug.day/ml after the 400 mg dose, thus golimumab appeared dose-proportional 
in this range. 
Study C0524T23 was previously submitted and assessed the PK profile, tolerability and safety of 
golimumab single SC dose of 50 and 100 mg, and has been assessed previously. The mean AUC inf in 
Caucasians was 48 ug.day/ml after a 50 mg dose and 129 ug.day/ml after a 100 mg dose, suggesting 
approximately dose proportionality.

Study C0524T15 was assessing the absolute bioavailability of SC administration of golimumab in 
healthy subjects, and has been assessed previously as part of the initial MAA.  
Study C0524T14 was assessing the multiple dose PK of golimumab in RA patients after IV and SC 
administration, and has been assessed previously as part of variation II10 (approved in July 2010). 
The study CNTO148NAP1001 and C0524T23 together were used to claim dose proportionality between 
50 and 400 mg golimumab SC. 
The PK parameters in healthy subjects after rich sampling in study C0524T15 was used to compare 
golimumab PK in healthy subjects to that in UC patients. In the population PK analysis of data from UC 
patients, golimumab Cl was estimated to be 0.544 L/day in a 70 kg subject. This value is similar to the 
Cl of 0.480 L/day for a 70 kg subject determined in study C0524T15. The half lives were also similar 
between the studies – 10.5 compared with 10.9 days. The MAH is also referring to PK data from RA 
patients (study C0524T14), where Cl/70 kg was estimated to be 0.535 L/day and half life 13 H and 11 
days, with and without concomitant administration of methotrexate.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Introduction  
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory disorder involving the large intestines 
and the rectum. The diseases is characterised by episodes of increased stool frequency and bloody 
diarrhoea. TNF-α is considered a key inflammatory mediator that exhibits a wide variety of functional 
activities and appears to play an important role in the pathogenesis of UC.  
Mechanism of action 
Golimumab is a human monoclonal antibody that forms high affinity, stable complexes with both the 
soluble and transmembrane bioactive forms of human TNF-α, which prevents the binding of TNF-α to 
its receptors. There are no new data related to pharmacodynamics in this application. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
For treated subjects in the phase III maintenance study C0524T18 who were randomized to receive 
golimumab, the proportions of subjects in clinical response through Week 54 and the proportions of 
subjects in clinical remission at both Week 30 and Week 54 were summarized by golimumab 
concentration quartile at Week 54. 
The proportion of subjects in clinical response through Week 54 was greatest among subjects in the 
highest concentration quartile (≥4.13 µg/mL; Figure 4). The proportion of subjects in clinical response 
through Week 54 was higher in subjects with golimumab concentration of ≥2.51 to <4.13 µg/mL 
compared with the proportions of subjects with serum golimumab concentrations of ≥1.63 to <2.51 
µg/mL and <1.63 µg/mL. 
The non-randomized non-responder group had approximately half the median drug levels before 
receiving the first maintenance dose compared with the randomized responders (1.31 compared with 
2.28-2.50 μg/ml).

and Week 54 by serum golimumab concentration; treated subjects who were randomized (excluding site 6706 and site 
7257) 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In study C0524T16 the mean concentration at week 6 was slightly lower than expected assuming dose 
proportionality. This could be due to limitations in the assay of golimumab and/or non-linear PK due to 
target mediated drug disposition (which is expected for an IgG-based antibody). Proportionality in 
exposure is approximately 1 µg/mL. In study C0524T17, dose proportionality was seen for all the 
doses based on median serum concentrations. In study C0524T18, with the proposed regimen, steady 
state golimumab levels were reached before week 14 after start of induction and the steady state 
levels were proportional between the 50 and 100 mg/4 weeks dose group. 
The choice of nonlinear mixed effects modeling for the analysis of the data is appropriate. The 
calculation of the fraction of concentration measurements below limit of quantification (BLQ) was made 
after exclusion of pre-dose and “trailing” BLQ data. However, the MAH stated that “trailing” BLQ data 
amounted to n=572 which, together with the BLQ data in the final PopPK data set, would sum up to 
~10% of the data. There was a high frequency of BLQ values at week 6 in the 1 mg/kg dose group in 
study C0524T16 as well as signs of non-proportional relation between doses with respect to median 
concentration at week 6. This should be viewed from the perspective of target mediated drug 
disposition which would lead to non-linear PK. Due to the relatively large number of BLQ values in the 
information rich part of the plasma concentration time profile, non-linear disposition may be obscured. 
The MAH does not seem to have explored this possibility during the structural model building phase. 
However, due to limitations of the bioassay, the low concentrations of golimumab may be subject to 
bias and detection of the potential non-linearity in PK difficult to perform. 
The method for covariate modeling which consisted of inclusion based on graphical exploration and 
significance testing in NONMEM followed by backward deletion from the tentative “full” model is 
sensitive to shrinkage which was reported to range from 17.7% for ETA2 (CL) to 44.7% for ETA1 (V2). 
However, a large number of covariates were included in direct significance testing in NONMEM which 
means that in practice a forward inclusion-backward deletion method was performed, at least for 
covariate effects on golimumab clearance. This partly mitigates the negative impact of shrinkage on 
this analysis.

Data from the two phase I studies indicate approximate dose proportionality of golimumab in the dose 
range 50-400 mg, but in line with what was observed in study C0524T16, slightly lower AUC than 
expected assuming dose proportionality was observed for the lowest dose. This could be due to 
limitations in the bioassay and/or target mediated drug disposition, which is expected for an IgG-based 
antibody. The data provided suggest similar PK (Cl as well as half life) in UC patients compared with 
RA patients and healthy subjects. 
The MAH has provided an analysis of golimumab dose linearity/proportionality in UC patients based on 
observed plasma concentration vs. time data. Looking at the IV data, there are some signs of 
disproportional increase in concentration in the range from 1 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg for IV administration 
(at Week 6 after start of administration). For the SC data there is a similar trend at week 6 after start 
of administration, albeit more subtle. The MAH speculated that this may be due to target mediated 
drug disposition as expected for a monoclonal antibody. Looking at the totality of data and taking the 
rather limited deviation from proportionality into account it is fair to conclude that pharmacokinetics of 
golimumab is approximately dose-proportional following SC administration over a dose range of 50 mg 
to 400 mg. 
Following induction doses of 200 mg and 100 mg golimumab at week 0 and 2, respectively, and 
maintenance doses of 50 mg or 100 mg golimumab subcutaneously every 4 weeks thereafter to 
patients with UC, serum golimumab concentrations reached steady state approximately 14 weeks after 
the start of therapy. Treatment with 50 mg or 100 mg golimumab subcutaneous every 4 weeks during 
maintenance resulted in a mean steady-state trough serum concentration of approximately 0.9 
± 0.5 µg/ml and 1.8 ± 1.1 µg/ml, respectively. In UC patients treated with 50 mg or 100 mg 
golimumab subcutaneously every 4 weeks, concomitant use of immunomodulators did not have a 
substantial effect on steady-state trough levels of golimumab. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Since golimumab is an IgG-based antibody directed towards TNF-alpha, target mediated drug 
disposition is expected. The data provided from both from healthy subjects and UC patients suggested 
a slightly more than dose-proportional increase in golimumab exposure. The PK in patients with UC 
does not seem to differ substantially from that in patients with RA and healthy subjects. This is an 
expected result, golimumab being an antibody and the parenteral administration should make the 
uptake independent of gastrointestinal disease. 
The proposed dose regimen with a higher initial dose followed by a second dose after 2 weeks before 
starting the maintenance monthly dosing seems reasonable from a pharmacokinetic perspective, 
reaching therapeutic plasma levels rapidly. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The assessment of efficacy in the sought indication was based on the randomised Phase II/III induction 
study C0524T17 and 54-week data of the phase III maintenance study C0524T18. An extension of 
study C0524T18 is ongoing. The study extension began at Week 54 and is to continue through Week 
228.

2.4.1.  Dose response study 
Induction study C0524T17 was divided in two parts: part 1 was a phase II dose-ranging portion and 
part 2 was a phase III dose-confirming portion. In the part 1 of the respective study, several doses 
were evaluated for continuation in part 2. On completion of part 1 data were analysed and the doses 
for part 2 were chosen. 
Study C0524T17  
The subcutaneous (SC) induction doses were based on results of infliximab studies in inflammatory 
bowel disease (IBD), predictions of previous and ongoing studies of golimumab and from preclinical 
studies. 
The three evaluated doses were:  
•  100 mg at Week 0 and 50 mg at Week 2 (100 mg → 50 mg) 
•  200 mg at Week 0 and 100 mg at Week 2 (200 mg → 100 mg) 
•  400 mg at Week 0 and 200 mg at Week 2 (400 mg → 200 mg) 
For continuation into part 2, the 200 mg → 100 mg and 400 mg → 200 mg golimumab SC dosage 
regimens were selected. The decision was based on PK, efficacy, exposure-response and the safety 
profile. Both doses were concluded to be effective and safe in the induction of clinical response. 
2.4.2.  Main studies 
The assessment of efficacy in the sought indication was based on the randomised Phase II/III induction 
study C0524T17 and the phase III maintenance study C0524T18.

Study C0524T17: A Phase 2/3 Multicenter, Randomized, Placebo-controlled, Double-blind Study to 
Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Golimumab Induction Therapy, Administered Subcutaneously, in 
Subjects with Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis (PURSUIT-Induction). 
Methods 
The two parts of the study, part 1 dose-finding and part 2 dose-confirming, were randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled and of parallel-group designs. There was no break in enrolment between Part 
1 and Part 2. In part 1 of the study 169 patients were randomized at Week 0. Part 2 of the study 
began when the 170th patient was randomized and 896 patients were randomized at Week 0 in Part 2.  
At week 6, patients were evaluated for clinical response. At this visit all patients, regardless of the part 
of the study into which they were enrolled, were eligible to enrol in the golimumab maintenance study 
(C0524T18). Patients not entering the golimumab maintenance study were evaluated for safety 16 
weeks following their last administration of study agent. 
Figure 6. Design of study C0524T17  
Study participants 
Main inclusion criteria: 
Subjects had to be men or women 18 years of age or older with moderately to severely active UC as 
defined by a Mayo score of 6 to 12 inclusive at baseline (Week 0), including an endoscopic subscore of 
≥2. Subjects must have had a biopsy result consistent with the diagnosis of UC and must have been 
ambulatory (i.e., not at imminent risk of colectomy). Subjects must have demonstrated an inadequate 
response to or have failed to tolerate oral 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASAs), or oral corticosteroids, or the 
immunomodulators azathioprine (AZA) or 6-mercaptopurine (6 MP), or have demonstrated 
corticosteroid dependence (i.e., an inability to successfully taper corticosteroids without a return of the 
symptoms of UC). 
Main exclusion criteria 
Subjects were not to be enrolled into the study if they were at imminent risk of colectomy. Subjects 
with UC limited to the rectum only or <20 cm of the colon, a stoma, a fistula, an obstruction, or 
adenomatous colonic polyps that were not removed were ineligible for entry into the study. Subjects 
with a history of latent or active granulomatous infection (including TB), a predisposition to infections, 
or a history of or increased potential for malignancy were ineligible for entry into the study. Subjects 
with a diagnosis or history of congestive heart failure, lymphoproliferative disease, systemic lupus 
erythematosus, or demyelinating disease were ineligible for entry into the study. Subjects with prior 
exposure to biologic anti-TNF agents were ineligible for entry into the study. 
Treatments 
Patients in part 1 were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of the following dose regimens:

golimumab 100 mg at Week 0 and 50 mg at Week 2 (100 mg → 50 mg) 
golimumab 200 mg at Week 0 and 100 mg at Week 2 (200 mg → 100 mg) 
golimumab 400 mg at Week 0 and 200 mg at Week 2 (400 mg → 200 mg) 
While the data from Part 1 were being evaluated, newly enrolled subjects in Part 2 were equally 
randomised to the same SC doses of golimumab or placebo as in Part 1. After the interim analysis, the 
selected doses were the 200 mg → 100 mg and 400 mg → 200 mg golimumab SC dose regimens for 
continued development in Part 2. Newly enrolled patients in Part 2 were thereafter equally randomized 
to 200 mg →100 mg or 400 mg → 200 mg golimumab or placebo. 
Objectives 
The primary objectives of part 1 of the study were to evaluate dose response and to select a SC 
induction regimen for golimumab. 
Objectives of the second part were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of golimumab in inducing clinical 
response. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was clinical response at week 6 defined as a decrease from baseline in the Mayo 
score by ≥30% and ≥3 points, with either a decrease from baseline in the rectal bleeding subscore of 
≥1 or a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1. 
The major secondary endpoints evaluated at week 6 were: 
•  Clinical remission (Mayo score ≤2 with no individual subscore >1) 
•  Mucosal healing (endoscopy subscore 0 or 1) 
•  Change from baseline in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) score (a ≥20 
point improvement was considered to be consistent with response) 
Sample size 
It was estimated that 176 patients in total would provide ≥80% probability of detecting a dose-
response relationship in part 1 of the study. 
The sample size for Part 2 was based on the consideration of statistical power and the objective to 
provide the target study population to be evaluated in the golimumab maintenance study C0524T18. 
Since no data were available for golimumab in the treatment of UC, estimates used for the sample size 
calculation were obtained from the ACT 1 and ACT 2 studies of infliximab in subjects with moderately 
to severely active UC. 
Due to the termination of the C0524T16 study the sample size of part 2 of study C0524T17 was 
increased to provide a sufficient number of subjects to enrol in and adequately power study C0524T18. 
Randomisation 
An IVRS was used to randomly assign subjects to study treatment and dispense study agent. In Part 1, 
subjects were randomly assigned to receive placebo or 1 of 3 dose regimens of golimumab (100 mg → 
50 mg, 200 mg → 100 mg, or 400 mg → 200 mg at Week 0 and 2, respectively) using an adaptive 
randomization procedure, with investigative site as the stratification variable. The randomization

method was a minimization procedure with a biased-coin assignment. In Part 2, eligible subjects were 
allocated to a treatment regimen using a permuted block randomization. 
Blinding (masking) 
There were no visual differences in appearance between the syringes of placebo and golimumab. The 
designated pharmacists or other appropriately licensed and authorized personnel who dispensed the 
study agent and independent drug monitors were unblinded to study agent. The subjects, site 
monitors, principal investigator and all the investigator site staff were blinded to study agent 
assignment. To protect the integrity of the study and the golimumab maintenance study C0524T18, 
treatment assignment blinding was maintained for investigative sites, site monitors and subjects 
participating in this study until the Week 54 analyses for the maintenance study were completed. 
Sponsor personnel were unblinded to treatment assignment for this study in 2 stages. At the first 
database lock, the data for subjects in Part 1 were unblinded and released to a limited number of 
sponsor personnel for analysis; the data for all subjects in Part 2 remained blinded at this time. At the 
second database lock, the data for all subjects was unblinded and released to a limited number of 
sponsor personnel for analysis. 
Statistical methods 
Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were summarized for all randomized subjects. Chi-
square tests or Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel [CMH] chi square tests, as appropriate, were used to 
compare the proportions of subjects achieving selected endpoints (e.g., clinical remission). In cases of 
rare events, Fisher’s exact test was used for treatment comparisons.  
Continuous response parameters were compared using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) or an ANOVA 
on the van der Waerden normal scores, as appropriate. All statistical testing was performed at the α = 
0.05 (2-sided) level unless otherwise specified.  
Control of Type I error 
In the C0524T17 study, after all patients in Part 1 had either completed the Week 6 visit or had 
terminated the study prior to Week 6, an analysis of the Part 1 data was performed to select induction 
doses for continued development in Part 2 of the study. No patients from Part 2 were unblinded at the 
time of the Part 1 database lock and the patients in Part 1 were not included in the primary analysis 
population, which was based on patients randomized in Part 2 after the dose selection. 
In addition, due to the stopping of the C0524T16 induction study, which together with the C0524T17 
induction study was to provide the required number of patients to power the maintenance study 
C0524T18, the number of patients in the C0524T17 study was increased. No data from patients in the 
primary analysis population in C0524T17 were used to determine the increase in sample size. 
Since no comparisons (blinded or unblinded) of the C0524T17 data for the primary analysis population 
were performed prior to the final database lock, no adjustments were made to the overall Type 1 error 
rate (α = 0.05, 2-sided) for the primary and major secondary endpoint analyses in the C0524T17 
study.  
Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data 
Patients with missing observations, unless otherwise specified, the last observation was carried forward 
for continuous endpoints with the exception of the Mayo and partial Mayo scores, where the last 
available Mayo subscores were carried forward. Patients with missing data were considered as not 
achieving the respective endpoints for dichotomous endpoints.

Results 
Participant flow 
Table 2. Number of patients who terminated study participation prior to Week 6 by reason for termination; randomized 
patients (study C0524T17) 
There were 16 (1.5 %) patients that terminated the study drug between weeks 0 and 6. Six of the 16 
patients completed the safety visit 16 weeks after the drug administration. Major reasons for 
terminating the study drug was AEs (placebo n=3, golimumab n=4) and lack of efficacy (n=2). 
A total of 50 patients terminated study participation. Thirty-five (3.3%; including 1 patient who was 
randomized but never treated) terminated prior to week 6, and 15 (1.4%) terminated between week 6 
and week 16.

The study was initiated on 18 July 2007 and completed on 29 November 2010. 
Conduct of the study 
There were two amendments to the protocol 
Amendment 1:  08 May 2008 
Amendment 2:  20 August 2009 
There were 3 major changes in the first amendment that concerned: 
• 
• 
• 
change to a permuted block randomization 
inclusion of corticosteroid dependant patients 
inclusion of patients refractory to or intolerant of oral 5-ASA only in order to permit for 
evaluation of early intervention with an anti-TNF-α agent 
Major changes in the second amendment concerned: 
• 
• 
increase of numbers of patients in part 2 to compensate for early termination of study 
C0524T16 
primary analysis population was changed to include only patients that randomized to part 2

Numbers analysed 
The primary analysis population was composed of patients randomized in Part 2 after the dose 
selection. Data from two sites (data from 13 randomized patients) were excluded from the primary 
efficacy analyses due to misconduct. The following pre-specified analysis populations were also 
evaluated for selected, pre-specified efficacy endpoints: 
•  Subjects randomized in Part 1 
•  Subjects randomized in Part 2 
•  Subjects randomized in Part 2 before the dose selection 
• 
•  All randomized subjects (Part 1 and Part 2 combined) 
First 450 subjects randomized in Part 2 after the dose selection 
Therefore the primary analysis population consisted of 761 subjects. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint  
Figure 7. Proportions of patients in clinical response at Week 6 in C0524T17; randomized

The result of the primary analysis was generally consistent in subgroups (demographic, UC disease, 
baseline medication), in sensitivity analysis regarding missing data and exclusion of patients and in the 
pre-specified efficacy populations with one exception; for patients randomized in part 2 before the 
dose selection the effect of golimumab was not evident due to a high placebo response rate (50%).

Study C0524T18: A Phase 3 Multicenter, Randomized, Placebo-controlled, Double-blind Study to 
Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Golimumab Maintenance Therapy, Administered Subcutaneously, in 
Subjects with Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis (PURSUIT-Maintenance). 
Methods 
The Study, C0524T18, was randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 3-arm, parallel-group study 
of the safety and efficacy of SC administration of golimumab in maintaining clinical response. Patients 
in clinical response to golimumab in one of the induction studies, C0524T16 or C0524T17 were invited 
to participate. Patients who were not in clinical response to golimumab or placebo in the induction 
studies were also eligible to enrol in this study but were not included in the key efficacy analyses. They 
were included in the safety and PK analyses only.  
Patients were to be discontinued from the study drug if there was no improvement of their disease 
activity by week 16. For patients that lost response through week 52 the following applied: 
• 
Placebo: Received golimumab 100 mg q4w 
•  Golimumab 50 mg: Re-randomized to receive golimumab 50 mg or 100 mg q4w 
•  Golimumab 100 mg:

1.  Prior to the implementation of Protocol Amendment 3, patients were re-randomized to 
receive golimumab 100 mg or 200 mg q4w. 
2.  After the implementation of Protocol Amendment 3, patients only received golimumab 
100 mg q4w. Patients who had been re-randomized to 200 mg q4w prior to 
implementation of Protocol Amendment 3 had their dose decreased to 100 mg q4w. 
Patients on immunomodulators and oral 5-ASA at baseline should remain on the same dose regimen 
throughout week 54. Patients in clinical response receiving oral corticosteroids were to begin tapering 
the daily dose at baseline. 
Patients were assessed for UC disease activity using the Mayo score at week 30 and 54 and by partial 
Mayo score every 4 weeks. At week 54, patients were evaluated for efficacy and safety. Patients that 
had successfully completed treatment (through week 52) were eligible to participate in a study 
extension. Patients who discontinued study agent but continued to participate in the study or did not 
enter the study extension were followed for 16 weeks after the last administration of study agent. 
Patients that discontinued prior to week 54 were followed for 54 weeks after the week 0 visit for 
information related to colectomy. 
Study participants 
The study population was adult patients with moderately to severely active UC (i.e., a Mayo score of 6 
to 12, inclusive, at baseline [Week 0 of an induction study], including an endoscopic subscore of ≥ 2) 
who had an inadequate response to or failed to tolerate oral 5-ASAs, or oral corticosteroids, or the 
immunomodulators AZA or 6-MP, or had demonstrated corticosteroid dependence (i.e., an inability to 
successfully taper corticosteroids without a return of the symptoms of UC). All patients were naive to 
anti-TNF therapy. 
Maintenance therapy was evaluated in patients who were in clinical response to golimumab at Week 6 
in either of the induction studies, C0524T16 or C0524T17. 
Main inclusion criteria:

calculate the baseline Mayo score, whichever of these 2 events came first, the following conditions 
must be met: 
a. If receiving 6-MP, AZA, or MTX, must have been receiving it for at least 12 weeks. The class of 
agent (6-MP/AZA versus MTX) prescribed may not have changed during those 12 weeks, and the dose 
must be stable for at least 4 weeks. 
b. If 6-MP, AZA, or MTX have been recently discontinued, they must have been stopped for at least 4 
weeks. 
c. If receiving oral 5-ASA compounds or oral corticosteroids (including budesonide), the dose must 
have been stable for at least 2 weeks.

antibiotics for the treatment of UC (ie, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, or rifaximin) 
f. 6-thioguanine (6-TG) must have been discontinued for at least 4 weeks. 
- Must have results from a biopsy collected at the screening endoscopy procedure or have a previous 
biopsy result obtained within the last year that is consistent with the diagnosis of UC. 
- All subjects ≥45 years of age must either have had a colonoscopy to assess for the presence of 
adenomatous polyps within 5 years of the first administration of study agent or a colonoscopy to 
assess for the presence of adenomatous polyps at the screening visit. The adenomatous polyps must 
be removed prior to the first administration of study agent. 
All the cases of colon polyps reported in the UC trials were confirmed to be inflammatory and with no 
dysplasia. 
Main exclusion criteria 
1. Have severe extensive colitis as evidenced by: 
• 
Investigator judgment that the subject is likely to require a colectomy within 12 weeks of 
baseline. 
or 
•  Symptom complex at screening or baseline visits that includes at least 4 of the following: 
1)  diarrhoea with ≥6 bowel movements/day with macroscopic blood in stool 
2)  focal severe or rebound abdominal tenderness 
3)  persistent fever (≥37.5°C) 
4)  tachycardia (>90 beats/minute) 
5)  anemia (hemoglobin <8.5 g/dL) 
2. Have UC limited to the rectum only or to <20 cm of the colon. 
3. Presence of a stoma. 
4. Presence or history of a fistula. 
5. Require, or required within the 2 months prior to screening, surgery for active gastrointestinal 
bleeding, peritonitis, intestinal obstruction, or intra-abdominal or pancreatic abscess requiring surgical 
drainage, or other conditions possibly confounding the evaluation of benefit from study agent 
treatment. 
6. Presence of symptomatic colonic or small bowel obstruction, confirmed by objective radiographic or 
endoscopic evidence of a stricture with resulting obstruction (dilation of the colon or small bowel 
proximal to the stricture on barium radiograph or an inability to traverse the stricture at endoscopy). 
7. History of extensive colonic resection (e.g., less than 30 cm of colon remaining) that would prevent 
adequate evaluation of the effect of study agent on clinical disease activity. 
8. History of colonic mucosal dysplasia. For subjects with a pathology finding of “indefinite dysplasia 
with reactive atypia,” the investigator should discuss the case with the medical monitor to determine 
eligibility. 
9. Presence on screening endoscopy of adenomatous colonic polyps, if not removed prior to study 
entry, or history of adenomatous colonic polyps that were not removed. 
Treatments 
Patients in clinical response were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio at week 0 to receive one of the following 
regimens:

every 4 weeks (q4w) through week 52. 
Figure 8. Treatment groups in Study C0524T18 
Objectives 
The primary objectives were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of golimumab in maintaining clinical 
response. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was clinical response (continuous) through week 54. Clinical response is defined 
as a decrease from Week 0 of C0524T16 or C0524T17 in the Mayo score by ≥ 30% and ≥ 3 points, 
with either a decrease in the rectal bleeding subscore of ≥ 1 or a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1). 
Subjects who lost clinical response at any time prior to Week 54 were considered not to be in clinical 
response for the primary endpoint analysis.  
The major secondary endpoints were: 
•  Clinical remission (defined as a Mayo score ≤ 2 points, with no individual subscore >1) at both 
week 30 and 54  
•  Mucosal healing (defined as endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1) at both week 30 and 54 
•  Clinical remission at both week 30 and 54 among subjects who were in clinical remission at 
week 0 of the maintenance study 
•  Clinical remission and not receiving corticosteroids at week 54 among subjects who were 
receiving corticosteroids at week 0 of the maintenance study 
Sample size 
The number of patients enrolled was dependant on the number who entered the study from the 
induction studies C0524T16 and C0524T17. The number of patients in the primary analysis population 
depended on the number of patients in clinical response to golimumab in the induction studies who 
consented to participate in this maintenance study. In order to ensure that there would be enough 
patients from the induction studies to meet the required number of patients for the primary analysis 
population of this study, at a designated time point near the completion of planned enrolment of 
C0524T17, the IVRS system projected, based on the available data and a predefined algorithm, 
whether or not the target number of patients for the primary analysis population of this study would be 
reached, and, if not, how many more patients from C0524T17 would need to be enrolled to reach the 
target. If the information provided by the IVRS vendor indicated that more patients would have been 
needed in this study, the sponsor may have increased the number of patients in C0524T17. Only data 
from this study (C0524T18) that was included in this calculation was the number of patients who had 
already entered the target population in this study. These data were only available to the IVRS vendor 
Simponi 
Assessment report  
EMA/640422/2013 
Page 25/60 
 
 
 
and no sponsor personnel had access. No comparisons (blinded or unblinded) of the C0524T18 data 
were performed prior to the Week 54 database lock. 
Randomisation 
An interactive voice response system (IVRS) was used to assign patients to study treatment and 
dispense study agent. Patients in clinical response to golimumab at Week 6 in C0524T16 or C0524T17 
were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio at Week 0 to one of three treatment groups (placebo, golimumab 50 
mg, or golimumab 100 mg) using an adaptive randomization procedure. 
Stratification was performed for investigative site, clinical remission status at Week 0 (yes or no), week 
0 corticosteroid use (yes or no) and mode and dose of induction dose. 
Blinding (masking) 
There were no visual differences in appearance between the syringes of placebo and golimumab. The 
designated pharmacists, or other appropriately licensed and authorized personnel who dispensed the 
study agent, and independent drug monitors were unblinded to study agent. The patients, site 
monitors, principal investigator, and all the investigator site staff were blinded to study agent 
assignment. 
Sponsor personnel remained blinded to treatment assignments until after the week 54 database lock. 
The study blind was maintained for the investigative sites, site monitors, and patients until the week 
54 analyses were completed.  
Statistical methods 
Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were summarized for all randomized subjects. Chi-
square tests or Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel [CMH] chi square tests, as appropriate, were used to 
compare the proportions of subjects achieving selected endpoints (e.g., clinical remission). In cases of 
rare events, Fisher’s exact test was used for treatment comparisons.  
Continuous response parameters were compared using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) or an ANOVA 
on the van der Waerden normal scores, as appropriate. All statistical testing was performed at the α = 
0.05 (2-sided) level unless otherwise specified.  
Control of Type I error 
No comparisons of the C0524T18 data were performed prior to the Week 54 database lock for 
C0524T18, and therefore no adjustments to the overall Type 1 error rate were necessary for 
C0524T18. 
Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data 
Patients with missing observations, unless otherwise specified, the last observation was carried forward 
for continuous endpoints with the exception of the Mayo and partial Mayo scores, where the last 
available Mayo subscores were carried forward. Patients with missing data were considered as not 
achieving the respective endpoints for dichotomous endpoints.

Recruitment 
The  study  was  conducted  at  251  study  centres.  The  study  was  initiated  on  28  September  2007  and 
completed on 24 October 2011. 
Conduct of the study 
There were 3 amendments to the protocol 
There were 2 major changes in the first amendment:  
•  prohibition of 6-thioguanine (6-TG) as a concomitant medication for safety reasons 
• 
addition of the induction dose factor as a stratum variable in the analysis of the primary 
endpoint 
Amendment 2 concerned the following major changes: 
• 
clarification of the re-randomization procedure on loss of clinical response where eligible 
patients received either the original dose or the double original dose  
•  patients with insufficient data (Mayo score) at week 30 or 54 should be considered not to be in 
clinical response for the primary endpoint analysis 
• 
addition of the process for gauging the enrolment of subjects into the primary analysis 
population. A process was added to determine whether the number of subjects in C0524T17 
should be increased to ensure the required number of subjects for the primary analysis 
population for this study. 
The purpose of amendment 3 was to stop dose adjustment to golimumab 200 mg q4w after reports of 
lymphoproliferative cancers in subjects with long standing RA.

Numbers analysed 
The primary analysis population is subjects randomized at Week 0 of this maintenance study (i.e., 
subjects in clinical response to golimumab induction at Week 0 of this maintenance study as 
determined by the IVRS), excluding those from 3 sites(sites 6706, 7257 and 7407). Therefore, there 
were 456 subjects in the primary analysis population. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint  
Figure 9. Proportion of patients in clinical response through Week 54; randomized patients 
(study C0524T18) 
In the target population, 37 % (172) patients had a dose adjustment. Dose adjustment due to loss of 
clinical response was the most common treatment failure criteria. The rate in the placebo group was 
49% followed by 34% and 28% in the 50 mg and 100 mg groups, respectively.  
Of patients in the 50 mg group that had a dose adjustment and that were re-randomized to receive the 
same dose, 37% (n=10) were in clinical response at week 54. The corresponding figure for patients 
that were randomized to receive 100 mg was 28% (n=7). Increasing the dose to 100 mg at dose 
adjustment did not impact clinical response or partial Mayo score. Corresponding efficacy analyses for 
patient in the 100 mg group who had a dose adjustment have not been performed. 
The result of the primary analysis was generally consistent in subgroups (demographic, UC disease, 
baseline medication) and in the pre-specified sensitivity analysis regarding missing data and exclusion 
of patients.

Corticosteroid Use 
At baseline, when tapering of the daily dose of corticosteroid began, the median daily dose was similar 
in the treatment groups. At week 30, daily doses were decreased in the 100 mg group (-7.50) and in

the 50 mg group (-10.00) while there were no change in the placebo group. At week 54 doses were 
similar in the 100 mg and the placebo group while there was still a decrease in the 50 mg group. 
The proportions of subjects who were not receiving concomitant corticosteroids at Week 54 were 
greater in the 100 mg group (32.9%) and significantly greater in the 50 mg group (41.0%) compared 
with the placebo group (21.8%; p = 0.028).  
The proportions of subjects who maintained clinical response through Week 54 and were not receiving 
concomitant corticosteroids at Week 54 were greater in the 100 mg group (30.5%) and significantly 
greater in the 50 mg group (38.5%) compared with the placebo group (20.7%; p = 0.026). 
Numbers of UC related hospitalizations were low across all treatment groups. 
The rate of colectomies through week 54, were 1.3% (n=2), 2.6% (n=4) and 1.9% (n=3) in the 100 
mg, 50 mg and placebo groups, respectively. 
Approximately 35% of the patients in the primary analysis population were in clinical remission at 
week 0. The study was not powered to detect a difference between the active and placebo treatment 
for this endpoint. 
Median CRP concentrations, faecal lactoferrin and calprotectin were lower in the 100 mg group than for 
patients in the placebo group and 50 mg groups at weeks 30 and 54. 
Ancillary analyses 
The time to first loss of clinical response through Week 54 is presented in Figure 10. The time to loss of 
clinical response was significantly longer in the 100 mg and 50 mg groups compared with the placebo 
group (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). The median time to loss of clinical response was 
greater than 54 weeks in the 100 mg and 50 mg groups (i.e., more than half of the subjects had not 
met the criteria for loss of clinical response by Week 54) and 27 weeks in the placebo group.

Supportive studies  
Study C0524T16: A Phase 2/3 Multicenter, Randomized, Placebo-controlled, Double-blind Study to 
Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Golimumab Induction Therapy, Administered Intravenously, in 
Subjects with Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis. 
An interim analysis to determine the optimal IV induction doses of golimumab was conducted after all 
subjects in Part 1 either completed the Week 6 visit or terminated study participation prior to Week 6.  
Following the subsequent dose response analysis for the golimumab SC induction study C0524T17 and 
a review of the totality of the data from both induction studies, it was recommended that the 
C0524T16 study is stopped and enrolment into the study is terminated. It was concluded that single IV 
administration of golimumab in subjects with moderately to severely active UC did not lead to 
significant improvement in disease activity.  
The study was terminated after 291 patients had been randomized and there were 115 also 
randomized in part 2. Patients already enrolled in the study were followed per the protocol and were 
invited to enter the 1-year golimumab maintenance study C0524T18. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The efficacy of golimumab for induction and maintenance treatment of patients with moderately to 
severely active ulcerative colitis has been evaluated. Patients received induction therapies that were 
evaluated after 6 weeks. Two induction studies were initiated with similar design but with different 
dosage regimen and mode of administration (IV/SC). The study using a single IV dose of golimumab 
was prematurely stopped since the SC induction therapy was found to have a more favourable effect 
on efficacy. The SC regimens that were studied further included two doses of the study drug at weeks 
0 and 2, 200 mg/100 mg or 400 mg/200mg. 
Patients in clinical response in the induction studies were eligible to continue into the maintenance 
study. The maintenance study was of double-blind placebo-controlled design and the effect of 
golimumab therapy, 50 mg and 100 mg every 4 weeks, was evaluated after 52 weeks.  
All patients included in the studies had experienced inadequate response to conventional therapy with 
corticosteroids, 6-mercaptopurine (6- MP)/azathioprine (AZA), or 5-ASA or were intolerant to or had 
medical contraindications for such therapies. All patients were further TNF-α naïve. According to the 
MAH the reason for inclusion of patients being refractory to 5-ASA only was to permit for evaluation of 
the efficacy and safety of early intervention with an anti-TNF-α agent. Further, it was pre-specified in 
the protocol that the inclusion should be limited to 10%. The MAH has presented data showing that 
there were 19% and 17% of patients that were refractory to 5-ASA only in the induction and 
maintenance studies, respectively. Excluding these patients from the efficacy analyses did not have 
any major impact on the results. 
In general, the design and the conduct of the studies seemed appropriate. However the primary 
efficacy endpoint for both the induction and maintenance studies was clinical response. This is not in 
accordance with current guidelines where induction and maintenance of remission is considered the 
primary efficacy parameter to be used. Patients were recruited from the induction studies for the 
maintenance study and were consequently in clinical response and not in remission at baseline. 
However, data from the subgroup of patients that were in remission at baseline of the maintenance 
study were also presented (third ranked secondary endpoint). Overall, the observed difference 
Simponi 
Assessment report  
EMA/640422/2013 
Page 35/60 
 
 
 
between placebo and active treatment was slightly larger for this group (patients in clinical remission 
at week 0 who maintained remission also at weeks 30 and 54). For patients in clinical response at 
Week 0, the difference in clinical remission at both week 30 and 54 was 8% and 12% for patients 
receiving 50 mg and 100 mg compared to placebo. Thus, the data from this subgroup are sufficiently 
supporting of efficacy. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Following induction treatment, the observed difference between golimumab and placebo in inducing 
clinical response was 22% and 25% for the 200 mg/100 mg and 400 mg/200 mg doses, respectively. 
Corresponding figures for the induction of clinical remission were 11% and 12%.  
For the maintenance treatment the observed difference between active and placebo treatment for 
maintaining response was 16 % for the 50 mg dose and 19 % for the 100 mg. The difference between 
active and placebo treatment for patients in remission both at week 30 and 54 was 8 % and 12 % for 
the low and high dose, respectively. Corresponding data from the subgroup of patients that were in 
remission at baseline of the maintenance study (n=163) and maintained remission through week 54 
were 12 % and 16 %. Thus, data from this subgroup further support the efficacy. 
Of all randomized patients in the maintenance study 28 % discontinued the study, the major reasons 
being lack of efficacy (placebo 12 %, 50 and 100 mg groups, 11 and 14 %, respectively) and AEs.  
The MAH proposed not to make any recommendations as regards discontinuation of therapy in patients 
who have responded to treatment since patients in clinical response to anti-TNF therapy are expected 
to have ongoing benefit from continued treatment. It is accepted that there are at present no data 
available to support a recommendation and the decision to continue therapy is left at the discretion of 
the treating specialist. Nevertheless, collection of data from clinical practice regarding treatment 
interruption is important and the MAH will collect additional data regarding this point in the ongoing 
long-term extension of the C0524T18 trial and the proposed Nordic National Register Database Study 
and the Spanish Registry (as detailed in the RMP).  
The available data suggested that clinical response is achieved within 12 to 14 weeks of treatment 
(after 4 doses). Continued therapy should be reconsidered in patients who show no evidence of 
therapeutic benefit within this time period.  
The initially proposed dosing for patients with UC was golimumab 200 mg SC week 0, followed by 100 
mg at week 2, then 100 mg every 4 weeks, thereafter. For the already approved indications the 
maintenance dose is 50 mg every month. The dose may be increased to 100 mg in patients >100 kg. 
For the approved indications the therapy should be reconsidered in patients who show no evidence of 
therapeutic benefit after receiving 3 to 4 additional doses of 100 mg. 
The difference between the two induction doses evaluated in part 2 of study C0524T17 was modest. 
The MAH’s proposal to recommend the lower dose is therefore supported. 
Concerning the proposed dose for maintenance treatment, 100 mg every 4 week, the clinical relevance 
of the difference between the two doses on efficacy and the rational for the proposed dosing is less 
clear. The differences between the doses were limited in spite of twice as high serum golimumab 
concentrations for the higher dose. Similar proportions of discontinuations due to lack of efficacy 
across all treatment groups further questions the rational from an efficacy point of view. In response to 
the question regarding the clinical relevance of the difference in efficacy between the two dosing 
regimens 50 mg and 100 mg, the MAH pointed out that although the response rates induced by both 
doses were clinically and statistically significant at week 54, maintenance of remission at weeks 30 and 
54 was only statistically significant for the higher dose as compared with placebo. However, although 
Simponi 
Assessment report  
EMA/640422/2013 
Page 36/60 
 
 
statistically significant, the clinical relevance of a difference in remission rate between the doses of 5 % 
for maintained remission was questioned by the CHMP. Furthermore, in clinical guidelines it is stated 
that the goal of maintenance therapy in UC is to maintain steroid-free remission. Although a difference 
between doses of 5% is not considered clinically relevant, in this comparison the lower dose was more 
effective than the higher dose (steroid-free remission at week 54; placebo 18%, low dose 28% and 
high dose 23%). Further, in the low dose groups there were 34% of patients that required a dose 
adjustment as compared to 28% in the high dose group. Corresponding figures for patients 
experiencing flares were 52% in the low dose group and 45% in the high dose group. Again the 
differences between the groups are modest (7-8%) and the importance and clinical relevance of these 
differences is unclear. 
Concerning colectomies through week 54, the numbers of patients were limited in all treatment 
groups, 3, 4 and 2 respectively, in the placebo, 50 mg and 100 mg groups. 
To support the use of the higher 100 mg dose, exposure-response relations have been further 
analysed. According to the MAH there is a positive correlation between exposure and key efficacy 
endpoints. The CHMP considered that the reporting of the modeling was very rudimentary and made 
secondary review difficult to perform. Even though a positive correlation between exposure and 
response is likely, the model needs to be further developed and thoroughly qualified before it can be 
used for the purpose of prediction. In response the MAH has presented further data that support the 
use of the 100 mg dose for patients >80 kg. The difference between the low and high dose groups for 
these patients is approximately 11-12% for the presented efficacy endpoints. The Applicant further 
proposed that patients <80 kg in clinical response who do not achieve clinical remission might benefit 
from a dose increase. However, supportive data are based on a too limited number of patients to make 
any firm conclusions. Thus, this proposal was not agreed by the CHMP. 
Those patients on 50 mg who lost response, were re-randomised to 50 or 100 mg q4w. Following re-
randomisation, there was no difference in response rate (37% vs. 28%, although numbers were 
small), suggesting that there is no point in increasing the dose in a patient who loses response.  
Data from the maintenance study implies that for patients in the 50 mg group that lost response, a 
dose increase did not affect the outcome at week 54.  
To conclude, presented data support an additional benefit of the 100 mg dose in patients >80 kg while 
for patients <80 kg there seems to be no major difference in clinical response/remission between the 
doses. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The results of the induction and maintenance studies for treatment of patients with moderate to severe 
UC with golimumab show a statistically significant effect on the primary efficacy endpoint that was 
supported with the result of major secondary endpoints, including remission. This overall dataset is 
accepted for the efficacy demonstration. The observed differences between active and placebo 
treatment are considered to be clinically relevant for patients with inadequate response or intolerance 
to conventional therapy. Based on the available data the 50 mg q4w dose is the recommended 
maintenance dose for patients with body weight less than 80 kg whereas patients >80 kg would 
benefit from a higher dose i.e. 100 mg q4w.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Data from the induction studies C0524T16 and C0524T17 and from the maintenance study C0524T18 
contributed to the safety evaluation. 
The safety presentations include:  
•  Summary of the safety data from the three individual UC studies. 
• 
Pooled safety data from the three UC studies from Week 0 of induction through Week 54 of 
maintenance for patients randomized in C0524T18 for a total of 60 weeks of follow-up.  
•  Data pooled from the UC studies and other disease populations in which golimumab has been 
studied (events of special interest and malignancies) 
Events of special interest include sepsis, pneumonia, tuberculosis (TB), opportunistic infections, 
cellulitis, demyelination, congestive heart failure (CHF), hypersensitivity reactions, serum sickness-like 
and anaphylactic reactions, and hepatobiliary events. 
Study C0524T17 
Two populations were evaluated for safety; all treated patients (parts 1 and 2 combined) and treated 
patients after dose selection in part 2. 734 patients received at least one dose of golimumab. 
Study C0524T18  
Three populations were evaluated, randomized patients (the target population), non-randomized 
patients and all treated patients through week 54. The data presentations focus on the placebo, 50 mg 
and 100 mg treatment groups. There were only 14 patients that received the 200 mg dose. There were 
1075 patients receiving active treatment;  
•  741 (69 %) were exposed for at least 6 months 
•  536 (50 %) were exposed for at least one year 
Data from other indications 
Data from studies in other disease populations involve 3935 patients and 7534 patient-years of follow-
up, and have been assessed within previous applications.

Adverse events  
Study C0524T16 
Thirty-one (31) percent of patients in the placebo group and 36% of patients treated with golimumab 
had AEs. Most frequently reported AEs were in the SOC Gastrointestinal disorders with the most 
common being colitis ulcerative (2.6% and 3.8% in placebo and actively treated patients).

frequency of ≥2% in any golimumab or placebo group) through Week 6 by MedDRA 
preferred term; treated patients 
The proportion of reasonable (possibly, probably or definitely) related events was 15-17 % with no 
major differences between treatment groups. 
The proportions of patients with AEs of severe intensity were 15.5 % and 16.8 % in the placebo and 
active groups, respectively.

The system organ class with the highest reported number of AEs were Gastrointestinal disorders and 
Infections and infestations. 
Treatment-emergent AEs of severe intensity were reported by 8.3%, 10.4% and 14.3% in the placebo, 
50 mg and 100 mg groups, respectively. Colitis ulcerative was the most commonly reported severe AE. 
For randomized patients the proportion of reasonable related events were 28%, 25% and 36% in the 
placebo, 50 mg and 100 mg groups, respectively.

Approximately 75% of non-randomized patients reported one or more treatment related AEs. The 
highest proportion of AEs was Gastrointestinal disorders. 
Pooled safety data from the three UC studies 
For patients who received golimumab in C0524T16 and C0524T17 and who were randomized in 
C0524T18, the proportions of patients with an AE from Week 0 of induction until week 54 of the 
maintenance study was 74%, 78%, and 79% in the placebo, 50 mg, and 100 mg maintenance 
treatment groups, respectively, with average weeks of follow-up of 38.8, 50.4, and 52.4, respectively.

week 0 of an induction study until week 54 (treated patients in studies C0524T16, 
C0524T17 and Co524T18). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Study C0524T16  
The proportions of patients with serious adverse events (SAEs) were 2.6 % in the placebo group and 
3.8 % in golimumab groups. Flares of UC were the only SAE that was reported from more than one 
patient (4 golimumab treated patients). 
There were no deaths during the study period. 
Study C0524T17  
The proportions of patients that reported SAEs were 6% (n=20) in the placebo group and 3% (n=20) 
in the golimumab groups. The most commonly reported events were colitis ulcerative followed by 
anaemia, dehydration and erythema nodosum. The numbers of patients with events that were 
considered to be reasonably related through week 6 were 12, 10 in the placebo group and 2 in the 
golimumab groups. 
Serious infections were reported from 1.8% and 0.5% in the placebo and golimumab groups, 
respectively (through week 6). Serious infection that was reported from >1 patient was pneumonia.  
There were two reports of opportunistic infections through week 6 (candidiasis and CMV infection) and 
2 reports after week 6 (CMV infections). 
Injection-site reactions were reported from 1.5% of placebo-treated and 3.4% of actively-treated 
patients. The most common reactions in the actively treated groups were injection-site erythema and 
pruritus. 
Malignancies were reported for 2 patients, carcinoma in situ and colon cancer that were identified in 
biopsies from one patient prior to the randomization and thyroid cancer was reported for one patient.

One report of a demyelinating disorder occurred after completion of the induction study. The SAE was 
reported while the patient was treated with placebo in study C0524T18 on day 160. The patient was 
treated with antibiotics and was asymptomatic and the lesion was resolving at a neurologic follow-up a 
year later. 
One patient died during the induction period due to an SAE of ischiorectal abscess, two weeks after the 
second golimumab dose. The patient suffered from severe ischiorectal abscess and was hospitalized. 
Due to the severity of the disease, there was necrosis of the rectum leading to an external fistula that 
was surgically treated. Subsequently perforations of the colon, requiring colectomy and ileostomy 
developed. Following the second surgery, peritonitis and sepsis developed that led to multisystem 
organ failure and approximately 10 weeks after the last dose of golimumab, the patient died. 
Study C0524T18  
For randomized patients in the placebo, 50 mg and 100 mg treatment groups, SAEs were reported in 
7.7%, 8.4% and 14.3%, respectively. The corresponding figures after taking into account the time of 
follow-up were 12.6, 10.4 and 17.1 SAEs per hundred patient-years. Colitis ulcerative was the most 
commonly reported SAE. For non-randomized patients approximately 15% reported SAEs and in this 
group were UC flares most commonly reported also. 
Among randomized patients the SOC with the most frequently reported AE considered to be reasonably 
related was Infections and infestations. 
Serious infections were reported from 1.9%, 3.2% and 3.2% of patients in the placebo and golimumab 
50 and 100 mg groups, respectively (randomized patients). Serious infection that was reported from 
>1 patient was appendicitis. Among non-randomized patients, the proportion was 2.2% 3.7% in 
patients receiving active treatment and no SAE was reported in the placebo group. SAEs reported from 
> 1 patient were disseminated TB and UC. 
There were 4 cases of tuberculosis (TB) reported through week 54. The patients were male, two from 
India and two from Poland. None of the patients had signs or symptoms of TB at baseline. However, 
one patient had a positive QFT-TB test result and received prophylactic treatment for latent TB on 
entering the induction study. Chest x-rays were read as normal in 3 of 4 patients, one patients was 
reported as having an abnormal result with no suspicion of TB. Two patients discontinued the study 
agent and one patient was treated and continued in the study. The patient with the positive QFT-TB 
test result received isoniazid treatment (and was compliant) but died at day 206 of disseminated TB. 
There were also 4 cases of opportunistic infections through week 54 (CMV infection (n=2), candidiasis 
and brain abscess).  
For randomized patients through week 54, there were reports of injection-site reactions in 1.9 % of 
patients in the placebo and 50 mg golimumab group and 7% in the 100 mg group. There were no 
severe and serious events reported. 
One non-serious AE of Type IV hypersensitivity reaction was reported for one patient in the golimumab 
100 mg group.  
There were four reports of malignancies. Two patients were diagnosed after placebo induction dosing 
and before receiving active treatment. The remaining two cases concerned one patient with lung 
adenocarcinoma (patient had COPD and had been a smoker for 40 years) and one patient with breast 
cancer. 
There were three deaths during the maintenance period. One randomized patient, died from cardiac 
failure on day 335. The patient had a history of thrombosis. Two non-randomized patients died of 
septic shock and disseminated TB on days 364 and 206, respectively. 
Simponi

EMA/640422/2013 
Page 42/60 
 
 
Four additional patients died during the long-term extension period (gallbladder adenocarcinoma, 
biventricular heart dysfunction, sepsis, heart failure and pneumonia). 
Data pooled from the UC studies and other disease populations 
The incidence (per 100 subject-years of follow-up) of events of special interest (i.e., sepsis, 
pneumonia, TB, opportunistic infections, cellulitis, demyelination, CHF, hypersensitivity reactions, 
serum sickness and anaphylactic reactions) were generally similar between all treated subjects in the 
UC studies and that of all disease populations in which golimumab has been studied as in table 14: 
Table 24. The incidence (per 100 subject-years of follow-up) of events of special interest in 
patients in the UC studies and that of all disease populations in which golimumab has been 
studied 
Among all golimumab treated UC patients, the rate of malignancies was 0.46 (CI: 0.15, 1.08) per 100 
patient-years of follow-up. The corresponding figure across other disease populations is 1.06 (CI: 0.86, 
1.30). 
In summary, 
•  When SAEs in C0524T18 were analysed as randomized, the overall proportions of SAEs were 
similar across treatment groups. In addition, in the randomized population, the proportions of 
subjects with colectomy were low (i.e., 1.9%, 2.6%, and 1.3% in the placebo, 50 mg, and 100 
mg groups, respectively; C0524T18 54-Week CSR\Sec6.5.5.2). These analyses based on 
safety data assessed according to the randomized treatment groups did not identify differences 
in the safety of subjects in the 50 mg versus the 100 mg groups, suggesting that the safety of 
50 mg and 100 mg dose regimens is comparable. 
•  Among all treated subjects in C0524T18, the higher proportions of subjects with SAEs in the 
100 mg group were primarily attributable to the increased rate of colitis ulcerative. This was 
not unexpected due to the high proportion of nonresponders in this population. When SAEs of 
colitis ulcerative are excluded from the analysis of all treated subjects, the safety between the 
50 mg and the 100 mg dose regimens was comparable. 
•  No Exposure-Response (E-R) relationship was observed for SAEs or serious infections with 
increased golimumab exposure. 
• 
The risks of SAEs, events of special interest, and malignancies (with the exception of TB, 
opportunistic infection, demyelination, and lymphoma) were similar between the 50 mg dose 
regimen and 100 mg dose regimen across all Phase 2b and Phase 3 studies. Higher incidences 
Simponi 
Assessment report  
EMA/640422/2013 
Page 43/60 
 
 
 
 
of TB, opportunistic infection, demyelination, and lymphoma were observed with the 100 mg 
dose regimen across all indications; these are known risks with anti-TNF agents. The current 
SmPC describes the greater incidence with the 100 mg dose regimen compared with the 50 mg 
dose regimen. 
•  An analysis of the discontinuation of study agent due to an AE through Week 52, in which 
discontinuation of study agent due to an AE were included in the subjects’ original randomized 
groups, showed a higher proportion of subjects discontinuing study agent in the placebo group 
than in either the 100 mg group or the 50 mg group. 
•  No new safety signals were observed with the 100 mg maintenance dose regimen in the UC 
population. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Markedly abnormal post-baseline values with regard to decrease in lymphocytes were reported for 
12% of golimumab and 18% of placebo treated patients in study C0524T17. Similar findings were 
identified in 36%, 25% and 22% of patients in the placebo, 50 mg and 100 mg treatment groups of 
study C0524T18. 
In study C0524T18 there were 3 patients with transient decreases of neutrophils <1.0 x 103 cells /µL. 
Chemistry 
Elevated potassium values were reported from 8 patients being actively treated.  
ALT and AST values ≥3 x ULN were uncommon both for placebo (n=3) and golimumab treated (n=2) 
patients in study C0524T17. In study C0524T18 there were 3 patients with concurrent elevations in 
ALT and total bilirubin (>2 x ULN). 
Safety in special populations 
The safety of golimumab was evaluated regarding the rates of AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to 
discontinuation of study agent and infections in the Phase 3 UC studies in subpopulations based on 
demographics (i.e., sex, race, age, and weight) and baseline disease characteristics (i.e. disease 
severity, disease duration, and extent of disease). In general there were no differences between the 
subgroups. However, for age, although the number of patients ≥65 was limited, n=51 (4%) in 
comparison with patients <65 (n=1182, 96%), the rate of AEs, SAEs, or serious infection were higher 
in the older population. In patients ≥65 the rates were 86%, 29% and 6% and in the younger 78%, 
15% and 4%, respectively. 
Immunological events 
In study C0524T17 there were 3 patients that had positive tests for antibodies to golimumab. 
Among treated patients that were negative for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) at baseline, 11 were 
positive for ANA antibodies (using a titre ≥1:160) at week 6 (4 patients that had received golimumab 
and 7 placebo). 
There were no patients that were positive for anti-dsDNA antibodies between baseline and at their last 
evaluation through week 6. 
In study C0524T18, a total of 20 (4.4%) of 455 randomized patients with appropriate samples for 
antibodies to golimumab were positive at week 54, 11 of 155 (7.1%) subjects in the placebo group 
Simponi 
Assessment report  
EMA/640422/2013 
Page 44/60 
 
 
(these subjects had received golimumab induction treatment), 4 of 152 (2.6%) subjects in the 
golimumab 50 mg group, and 5 of 148 (3.4%) subjects in the golimumab 100 mg group. Among the 
subjects who were positive for antibodies to golimumab, the majority (16/20) had titers under 1:640.  
The corresponding figures for all treated patients (randomized and non-randomized patients were, of 
1103 appropriate samples, 32 (2.9%) were positive, 21 of 32 had titers under 1:640. 
There were 6 (2.7%) patients in the placebo group, 6 (4.3%) and 31 (3.8%) in the golimumab 50 mg 
and golimumab 100 mg groups, that were positive for ANA antibodies between baseline and week 54. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In study C0524T17, 4 patients in the placebo and 3 in the active groups discontinued due to AES 
during the induction period. Five (5) of these patients discontinued due to an SAE (viral infection, 
erythema nodosum and rash, colitis ulcerative (n=2), carcinoma in situ and colon cancer (identified in 
biopsies prior to randomization)). 
Of randomized patients in the placebo, 50 mg and 100 mg golimumab groups in study C0524T18, 6%, 
5% and 9%, discontinued due to AEs. The discontinuation was due to UC flares in 2%, 4% and 4% of 
patients in these groups, respectively. Corresponding figures taking into account time of follow-up 
were 10.4, 6.2 and 10.4 per hundred patient-years.  
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The most commonly reported events were flares of UC followed by nasopharyngitis and headache. 
Worsening of UC was the most common adverse event and was also the dominating reason for 
discontinuations. 
There were no major differences between the two active treatment groups in numbers of AEs. 
However, the rate of SAEs and discontinuations due to AEs was higher in the 100 mg group than in the 
50 mg group. Among patients receiving the 50 mg dose there were 8.4% that had SAEs and 5% 
discontinued due to AEs. Corresponding figures for patients on 100 mg were 14.3% and 9%. 
The proposed treatment for UC involved higher dosing regimen than for the already approved 
indications. However, there are safety data from other disease populations including about one 
thousand patients being exposed to golimumab (100 mg) for at least one year and 760 for at least 96 
weeks. Thus, although long-term safety data is sparse in the UC indication, there are safety data 
available for the higher dose from clinical trials in other patient populations. Furthermore, it has been 
concluded that the higher maintenance dose should be restricted to patients >80 kg. 
Important potential risks for the UC population are colon dysplasia/colon cancer and hepatosplenic T-
cell lymphoma (HSTCL). The MAH agreed to add wording on the potential risk for HSTCL and colon 
carcinoma/dysplasia in Section 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for Use of the SmPC. HSTCL has 
also been added as a class-effect adverse drug reaction in Section 4.8. Colon carcinoma/dysplasia and 
HSTCL have been added as important potential risks for golimumab in the RMP. 
Safety data from patients above the age of 65 have been presented. Overall it seems  elderly patients 
have a similar incidence of AEs and SAEs as younger patients.

2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of golimumab is well established and is characterised by several potentially serious 
risks. No new safety issues were revealed in the UC clinical trials. There seems to be a dose related 
increase in SAEs. 
Adequate risk minimisation as well as pharmacovigilance activities are in place from previous 
procedures. Safety data from studies in the UC programme indicated that the safety profile in the 
treatment of ulcerative disease is similar to that for other approved indications. There were no new 
safety concerns identified. 
The treatment of UC is a new indication for golimumab, and long-term benefits and risks of golimumab 
treatment in UC are currently unknown. Potential risks of treatment of UC with biologic agents, 
including anti-TNFα agents, as well as conventional therapy, include colorectal dysplasia, colorectal 
cancers, and HSTCL. The rate at which subjects with UC have colectomies is also an important factor. 
The CHMP requested the MAH to collect disease-based UC registry data as an additional 
pharmacovigilance activity to assess the long-term safety of golimumab in adult subjects with UC. The 
Nordic National Register Database Study is proposed as a registry for these purposes. A feasibility 
assessment will be conducted to determine whether the data from the Spanish Registry would also be 
useful in this regard. These measures are described in the updated RMP. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
- The MAH should submit the protocol for the Ulcerative Colitis Registry within the Nordic National 
Registry Database for review by December 2013. 
- The MAH should provide the timelines of the feasibility assessment for utilising the Registry in Spain 
as an additional source of information for collection of long term safety data in patients with ulcerative 
colitis by October 2013.  
2.5.4.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged.  
2.6.  Risk management plan    
2.6.1.  PRAC advice 
The CHMP received the following PRAC advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan. 
PRAC Advice 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 8.5 the PRAC considers by consensus 
that the risk management system for golimumab (Simponi) in the treatment of: 
moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult patients who have had an inadequate response 
to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA) 
or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies is acceptable provided 
that the MAH submits the protocol for the Ulcerative Colitis Registry within the Nordic National 
Registries Database for review within 6 months of the CHMP Opinion. 
Simponi

The MAH is also requested to provide the timelines of the feasibility assessment for utilising the 
Registry in Spain as an additional source of information for collection of long term safety data in 
patients with ulcerative colitis.  
An updated RMP should be submitted before the CHMP Opinion with the available milestones for these 
studies.

The PRAC noted the proposal outlines by the MAH for the two different registry options in UC (the 
Nordic National Register Database Study and the Registry in Spain.  
The PRAC considered that both of these databases would be able to generate the required data 
including comparisons of Simponi with biologic, as well as non-biologic treatments, and possible 
switches between different treatments.  
The PRAC recommended that the proposal for the protocol for the Nordic registry should be submitted 
within 6 months of the CHMP opinion. 
The PRAC also requested that the time lines for the feasibility assessment for using the Spanish 
registry should also be outlined in a revised RMP which should be submitted .

been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Variation EMEA/H/C/992/WS0312/0041 submitted to add Melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma in the 
Simponi EU SmPC was approved on 22 November 2012. The MAH committed as part of this variation 
to add melanoma as an identified risk and MCC as potential risk to the RMP of Simponi with the next 
RMP update. This update was made a part of the RMP approved with the II/39 variation. Following this 
update of the RMP, the MAH has taken the opportunity to update the information regarding the 
educational material in Annex II. This is agreed by the CHMP. 
Furthermore, minor editorial changes have been introduced to the labelling. 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Golimumab has been approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and 
ankylosing spondylitis (AS) since 1st October 2009. 
The efficacy of golimumab for induction and maintenance treatment has been evaluated in patients 
with moderate to severely active ulcerative colitis. The patients had active disease despite adequate 
treatment with 6-MP, AZA, corticosteroids, and/or 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA) compounds, or were 
intolerant to or had medical contraindications for conventional therapy. 
The effect of golimumab for induction of response was evaluated after 6 weeks. Two induction studies 
with similar design but with different modes of administration (SC and IV) were initiated. The study 
using a single IV dose was prematurely stopped due to a more favourable effect of the SC induction 
therapy. The SC administration included two doses of the study drug at weeks 0 and 2 (200 mg/100 
mg or 400 mg/200mg). For the primary efficacy endpoint clinical response, (decrease of Mayo score 
≥30% and ≥3 points with decreased rectal bleeding subscore ≥1 or subscore of 0 or 1), the observed 
difference between golimumab and placebo was 21% and 25% for the 200 mg/100 mg and 400 
mg/200 mg doses, respectively. Corresponding figures for the highest ranked secondary endpoint, 
induction of clinical remission (Mayo score ≤2 with no subscore >1), were 11% and 12%.  
Patients in clinical response from the induction studies were invited to continue into the maintenance 
study. The maintenance study was of double-blind placebo-controlled design and the effect of 
Simponi 
Assessment report  
EMA/640422/2013 
Page 56/60 
 
 
 
 
 
golimumab therapy, 50 mg and 100 mg every 4 weeks, for 52 weeks was evaluated. The observed 
difference between active and placebo treatment for maintaining clinical response was 16% for the 50 
mg dose and 19% for the 100 mg. The difference between active and placebo treatment for patients in 
remission both at week 30 and 54 was 8% and 12% for the low and high dose, respectively. 
The results of the induction and maintenance studies for treatment of patients with moderate to severe 
UC with golimumab showed a statistically significant effect on the primary efficacy endpoint that was 
supported with the result of major secondary endpoints. The observed differences between active and 
placebo treatment are considered to be clinically relevant for patients with inadequate response or 
intolerance to conventional therapy. Furthermore, the magnitude of effect of golimumab for induction 
and maintenance treatment in the UC population is similar to that of other TNF-α inhibitors. 
Data has been presented showing that there were 19% and 17% of patients that were refractory to 5-
ASA only in the induction and maintenance study, respectively. The rational for the inclusion of this 
population, that is generally not considered for anti TNF-α therapy, was to explore the effect of early 
intervention. Excluding these patients from the efficacy analyses did not have any major impact on the 
results. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The MAH has discussed the need for recommendations as regards discontinuation of therapy in 
patients who have responded to treatment. The MAH stated that patients in clinical response to anti-
TNF therapy are expected to have ongoing benefit from continued treatment. It is accepted that there 
are at present no data available to support a recommendation and the decision to continue therapy is 
left at the discretion of the treating specialist. Nevertheless, collection of data from clinical practice 
regarding treatment interruption is important and the MAH will collect additional data regarding this 
point the ongoing long-term extension of the C0524T18 trial and the proposed Nordic National Register 
Database Study and the Spanish Registry (as detailed in the RMP). 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of golimumab is well established and is characterised by several potentially serious 
risks, including infections and potential risks of lymphoproliferative disorders and malignancies, 
congestive heart failure and demyelinating disorders. Adequate risk minimisation as well as 
pharmacovigilance activities are in place from previous procedures.  
Safety data from studies in the UC programme indicated that the safety profile in the treatment of 
ulcerative disease seems to be similar to that for other approved indications. There were no new safety 
concerns identified. The most commonly reported events were flares of UC followed by nasopharyngitis 
and headache. Worsening of UC was the most common adverse event and was also the dominating 
reason for discontinuation. The SmPC contains recommendations to stop treatment in subjects who do 
not respond within a defined time frame. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Long-term safety data from the UC indication is sparse, in particular for the proposed maintenance 
dose 100 mg, which also is higher than what has previously been approved for other indications. Data 
from other disease populations have been presented, which include safety data from one thousand 
Simponi 
Assessment report  
EMA/640422/2013 
Page 57/60 
 
 
 
patients being exposed to golimumab (100 mg) for at least one year and 760 for at least 96 weeks. 
The presented safety experience from other indications gives a sign of numerically higher rates of 
events of special interest with the 100 mg dose than with the 50 mg dose.  
Although overall no new safety signals have been identified in the presented studies, follow-up on the 
limited long-term safety is of importance. In response to a question regarding a registry, the MAH has 
submitted outlines for two registry options addressing the use of golimumab in the treatment of active 
moderate to severe UC in adult patients(as detailed in the RMP). 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The observed differences in efficacy between placebo and active treatment show that there is an effect 
of golimumab in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. The demonstrated effect is 
considered to be of clinical relevance for patients that have previously failed conventional therapies.  
Treatment with golimumab and also alternatives for ulcerative colitis is associated with potentially 
serious adverse events. Main concerns regarding treatment with golimumab are the increased risk of 
infections and potential risks of lymphoproliferative disorders and malignancies, congestive heart 
failure and demyelinating disorders. A special concern in young adults with ulcerative colitis for 
treatment with TNF-α inhibitors, is the potential risk of developing hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma 
(HSTCL). These risks have been addressed in the updated RMP and the PI. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The benefit-risk balance of golimumab use in ulcerative colitis is positive. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The results show statistically significant effects of golimumab in inducing and maintaining 
response/remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. The observed differences 
between active and placebo treatment are considered to be of clinical relevance for patients who have 
experienced inadequate response to conventional therapies. 
Considering the potentially serious safety profile of golimumab it has been agreed that the higher 
maintenance dose should be restricted to patients >80 kg. Data has been presented supporting a gain 
in efficacy with the 100 mg dose for those patients compared with the 50 mg q4w dose 
The MAH has updated the Product Information and has accepted the CHMP comments. An updated 
RMP has been submitted in accordance with the PRAC’s recommendations.

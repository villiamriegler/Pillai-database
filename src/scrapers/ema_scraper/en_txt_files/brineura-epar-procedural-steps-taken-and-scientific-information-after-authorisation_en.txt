SmPC, Annex 
Based upon the data that have become available since the 
II, Labelling 
granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP 
and PL 
considers that the benefit-risk balance of Brineura remains 
positive, but considers that an additional renewal is 
required for the following reasons: 
In the framework of the initial marketing authorisation 
under exceptional circumstances, a post-authorisation 
efficacy study (study 190-203) has been adopted as 
specific Obligation (SOP). An in-depth assessment of the 
totality of the data is needed at the time of submission of 
the final CSR, especially an in-depth assessment for 
efficacy and safety data for those patients <2 years of age. 
This will include the appropriateness of the current dosing 
recommendations with regard to efficacy and safety in 
younger children (below the age of 3 years), taking the 
available PK data into consideration.  
A second renewal of the marketing authorisation is required 
due to unfulfilled SOB, i.e. an uncompleted post-
authorisation efficacy study, study 190-203

The SmPC section 4.4 has been updated as follows:  
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
“Material degradation of the intracerebroventricular access 
device reservoir occurs after long periods of use according 
to preliminary results of benchtop testing and as observed 
in clinical trials with approximately 4 years of use. In two 
Page 7/11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
clinical cases, the ICV access devices did not show signs of 
failure at the time of infusion; however, after removal, 
material degradation of the devices were apparent and 
consistent with data from benchtop testing of ICV access 
devices. The access devices were replaced and patients 
resumed treatment with Brineura. 
Access device replacement should be considered prior to 4 
years of regular administration of Brineura, however it 
must always be ensured, that the intracerebroventricular 
access device is used in accordance with the provisions of 
the respective medical device manufacturer.” 
The PL has been updated accordingly. 
II/0007 
Update of sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC in 
06/12/2018 
19/11/2019 
SmPC and PL 
Following a routine pharmacovigilance review, it has been 
order to update the safety information of Brineura in 
relation to device-related complications and 
meningitis, and to include meningitis as a possible 
adverse reaction, based on data collected from 
clinical trials and post-marketing experience. The 
package leaflet is updated accordingly. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
observed intracerebroventricular access device-related 
infections, including sub-clinical infections and one case of 
meningitis, in patients treated with Brineura. As a result 
meningitis has been included in the SmPC as an adverse 
drug reaction with frequency “not known”. Meningitis may 
present with the following symptoms: fever, headache, 
neck stiffness, light sensitivity, nausea, vomiting, and 
change in mental status. The signs and symptoms of 
device-related infections may not be apparent, therefore, 
cerebrospinal fluid samples should routinely be sent for 
testing to detect subclinical device infections.

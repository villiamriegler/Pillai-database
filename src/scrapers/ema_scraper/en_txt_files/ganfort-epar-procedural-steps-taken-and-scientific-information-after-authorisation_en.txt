To introduce a new preservative free 0.4 ml 
presentation of Ganfort 0.3 mg/ml eye-drops 
solution, in single-dose container. As a consequence, 
the product formulation, specification and test 
methods were updated, and a new supplier of the 
Labelling and 
PL 
Ganfort, with this variation, the MAH proposed to change 
the prescribing and patient information in relation to the 
active substances bimatoprost and timolol.  
The CHMP considered the proposals for the SmPC sections 
4.4, 4.8 and 4.9, and PL section 4 to be acceptable and 
overall improve the text of the prescribing and patient 
information. 
The main changes were addition of clarifying text in the 
warnings section to describe possible reasons for changes 
to the colour of the iris. Warnings on the use of Ganfort 
during active eye inflammation, potential for hair growth 
and potential consequences of taking more than one 
bimatoprost dose per day were also included. Additionally, 
section 4.8 was revised, mainly to update the frequencies 
of some side effects.

Removal of the restriction to morning-only dosing 
20/09/2012 
24/10/2012 
SmPC and PL 
This change to the dosing regimen recommendations from 
from the posology section (4.2) of the SPC in order 
to allow a choice of either morning or evening once-
daily dosing. The pharmacodynamics section (5.1) of 
the SPC has also being updated regarding morning 
and evening posology. The Package Leaflet (PL) has 
also been revised in line with the SPC wording. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
morning dosing to the possibility of morning or evening 
dosing of Ganfort eye drops was supported by a 
comprehensive review of two GCP compliant studies 
published in peer reviewed journals. One directly compares 
am to pm dosing of Ganfort eye drops in exfoliative 
glaucoma patients, the other comparing the IOP decreasing 
effect of Ganfort and a travoprost/timolol fixed combination 
eye drops, both dosed in the evening. A literature review of 
supportive studies and a justification of the extrapolation of 
the patient population with exfoliative glaucoma to a 
population with open angle glaucoma are also major parts 
of the submission. 
The MAH has demonstrated that the proposed amendment 
to SPC Section 4.2 is appropriate.  
The safety information from the pm dosing regimen is 
consistent with what is known from the am dosing schedule 
– with the reservation that literature data do not possess 
the same accuracy than data collected in clinical trials with 
regulatory purpose. There is, however, no reason to believe 
that a pm dosing should be more prone to adverse events – 
on the contrary, a slightly better outcome may be 
anticipated as some adverse events may occur during 
sleep, thus being less bothersome to the patient. 
Compliance may be a weak point in glaucoma patients, who 
in earlier stages are symptom free and hence not always 
Page 7/11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adhering to the prescriptions. Hence, any potential benefit 
of compliance might improve the outcome for patients with 
this often symptom-free disorder. 
In conclusion, the proposed changes in sections 4.2 and 5.1 
in the Ganfort SPC do not have any impact on the positive 
Benefit / Risk Balance of Ganfort eye drops.

hyper-pigmentation. The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications

observed while using Ganfort with a frequency ‘common’.  
“Iris hyper-pigmentation” (darker iris colour) and

listed for timolol. The Package Leaflet has also been revised 
to bring in line with the recommended PhVWP PL wording 
and the proposed SPC. The recommended PhWVP PL 
wording was amended slightly in some parts to make the 
wording more patient friendly.

The benefit/risk for the product was assessed based on the 
Labelling and 
submitted PSUR data and safety/efficacy data accumulated 
PL 
since the granting of the MA and a review of literature data. 
No new pre-clinical or clinical data were available which 
changed or resulted in a changed risk-benefit evaluation.  
Based on the CHMP review of the available information and 
on the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit risk balance, 
the CHMP was of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of Ganfort continued to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated and therefore considered that the 
benefit risk profile of Ganfort continues to be favourable. 
The CHMP was also of the opinion that the renewal could be 
granted with unlimited validity.

this has been reported with Ganfort treatment. The 
resulting text in section 4.4 is the following 
"Cystoid macular oedema has been reported with 
GANFORT. Therefore, GANFORT should be used with 
caution in patients with known risk factors for macular 
oedema (e.g. aphakic patients, pseudophakic patients with 
a torn posterior lens capsule)." 
In section 4.8 of the SPC, "cystoid macular oedema" has 
been added as an adverse drug reaction. 
The package leaflet has been updated accordingly.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Transfusion and iron chelation therapy can be a lifelong requirement for many patients with 
transfusion-dependent anemias. Compliance with iron chelation therapy can influence the frequency and 
severity of iron overload-related complications, with demonstrated improvement in organ dysfunction 
and survival in patients compliant with iron chelation therapy (Taher AT et al., 2017). Iron homeostasis is 
a complex system that balances both the absorption of intestinal iron and release of stored iron, with the 
body’s iron requirements. There are several molecules, such as hepcidin, ferritin, and ferroportin that 
provide tight regulation of this process, and contribute to iron homeostasis. Under normal circumstances, 
almost all absorbed iron is rapidly bound to transferrin (TF), an abundant, high-affinity iron-binding 
protein. Iron occupies approximately 30% of TF iron-binding sites. In heavily transfused patients, non-TF 
bound iron begins to accumulate. Labile plasma iron (LPI), a directly chelatable form of non-TF bound 
iron, is readily taken up by cells, leading to expansion of the cellular iron pool and generation of reactive 
oxygen species, resulting in cellular dysfunction and death. (Chalmers AW et al., 2016). The aim of 
treatment is to remove excess iron storage from the body. Deferasirox is an orally active iron chelator 
belonging to a new class of tridentate iron chelators, the N-substituted bis-hydroxyphenyl-triazoles. 
Deferasirox is claimed to mobilize tissue iron and promote its excretion, primarily in the faeces. 
This centralised application for marketing authorisation concerns a generic application according to article 
10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC for Deferasirox Mylan 90 mg, 180 mg and 360 mg film-coated tablets. The 
originator product is Exjade 90 mg, 180 mg and 360 mg film-coated tablets (MAA No: 
EU/1/06/356/011-019, Novartis Europharm Limited) for which marketing authorisation was granted in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/509090/2019  
Page 9/37 
 
 
 
 
the European Union on 28 August 2006 on the basis of a complete dossier in accordance with Article 8(3) 
of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
A single bioequivalence study was conducted in fasting state in healthy volunteers; comparing the 
applicant’s Deferasirox film coated tablets 360 mg with Exjade (deferasirox) 360 mg Film coated tablets 
of Novartis Europharm Limited. 
Additionally, the applicant provided a bioequivalence study with the crushed tablets consumed with apple 
sauce.

Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
For deferasirox an Active Substance Master File (ASMF) has been provided by the active substance 
manufacturer. Brief description of the validated manufacturing process of the active substance is 
presented in the ASMF applicant’s part provided by the finished product manufacturer. The brief 
description includes a satisfactory discussion on the proposed starting materials, including the used 
reagents and solvents has been provided together with a discussion about possible impurities into the 
final active substance. 
The flow chart and a narrative description of the manufacturing process have also been provided. The 
critical steps have been defined and appropriate in-process controls have been established. Detailed 
information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of the 
ASMF and it was considered satisfactory.  
Representative certificates of analysis (CoA) have been provided, and the suppliers, the brief description 
of the synthetic pathway have also been provided. Starting material specifications include identification 
tests, and limits for assay, related impurities and other relevant physico-chemical parameters. 
Specifications and methods of analysis have been provided, which control the impurity content and 
relevant physical parameters of the intermediates. The specifications for the reagents and solvents used 
in the process are considered suitable.  
The critical manufacturing steps have been identified. Adequate in-process controls have been 
established to control completion of reaction and loss on drying at the end of the respective stages, these 
have been adequately described, method descriptions have been presented.  
The specifications and methods of analysis for the two intermediates have been provided, which control 
the impurity content and relevant physical parameters of the intermediates. Certificates of analysis have 
been provided for the intermediates to show that the proposed specifications are in line with obtained 
results. Fate and purge of reagents have been discussed. 
The manufacturing process development has been very briefly described, but considering the simplicity of 
the process, this is considered acceptable. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of active substances. The active substance was characterized by IR, UV, NMR, mass 
spectroscopy, elemental analysis, thermal analysis and XRD. Sufficient data has been presented. The 
methods used for elucidation of structure are adequate. Typical spectra have been enclosed. The 
spectrum assignations are consistent with the declared chemical structure. Information on elemental 
analysis is also provided. The results confirm the theoretical elemental composition of the active 
substance. The active substance manufacturer consistently produces the same crystalline form of the 
active substance. Stability of the polymorphic form has been adequately discussed. 
An evaluation of the potential related impurities of deferasirox that could be introduced via the 
manufacturing process or from degradation pathways has been conducted. Potential and actual 
impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. Characterisation of specified 
related substances has been presented. The listed impurities are either routinely controlled in the active 
substance specification, or their absence has been satisfactorily demonstrated in production batches. The 
discussion of genotoxic impurities is acceptable. 
All of the residual solvents used in the synthesis steps of the commercial process are routinely controlled.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/509090/2019  
Page 11/37 
 
 
 
 
A satisfactory elemental impurities risk assessment was conducted following the principles outlined in ICH 
Q3D.  
Specification 
Deferasirox has no European Pharmacopoeia monograph. The specifications include tests and limits for 
appearance, solubility (Ph. Eur.) identity (IR, HPLC), assay (HPLC), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), sulphated 
ash (Ph. Eur.), related substances (HPLC and LC-MS/MS), residual solvents (GC) and identification of 
polymorph (PXRD). 
The proposed parameters and impurities limits are acceptable, the latter correspond to the requirements 
of ICH Q6A, ICH Q3A ICH Q3C and ICH Q3D guidelines. The limits are in line with the batch data and the 
stability results. Impurities have been evaluated and found to be acceptable from the point of view of 
safety. 
Analytical procedures and reference standards 
The analytical methods have been suitably described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
materials is provided. 
Batch analysis 
All presented batch analysis (9 batches) results conform to the API manufacturer’s specifications. The 
active substance produced is of consistent quality. The results are within the specifications and consistent 
from batch to batch. 
Container closure 
Deferasirox is packed into an antistatic white low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bag, twisted and tied with 
a plastic fastener.  
Compliance of the primary packaging material with the relevant regulations has been certified. The 
information presented on the packaging materials is sufficient and adequate. 
Stability 
Stability studies have been conducted in accordance with the ICH guidelines, at accelerated 
(40°C/75%RH) and long-term (25°C/60%RH) conditions. The studies have been initiated for 3 batches. 
The scale of batches corresponds to the proposed batch size, taking into account the yield range. The 
packaging material resembles the commercial packaging. The analytical methods are the same as for 
routine testing. The following parameters were tested during stability studies: description, loss on drying, 
impurities, assay. 
All results comply with the requirements up to the presented time-points. No out-of-specification result 
has been measured. 
Forced degradation studies have revealed that deferasirox degrades in acidic medium at 60°C, but no 
significant degradation can be observed in basic and oxidative media as well as under the effect of heat 
and light. The active substance is photostable. 
Measurements were undertaken to demonstrate stability of the polymorphic form. 
Based on the stability data presented all tested parameters were within the specifications and the 
proposed re-test period can be accepted.

2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development   
The finished product is film-coated tablets containing 90, 180 or 360 mg of deferasirox as active 
substance and their appearance is as follows: 
90 mg strength: a peach, film-coated, modified capsule shaped, biconvex tablet debossed with“ ” on 
one side of the tablet and ‘DF’ on the other side. Approx. tablet dimensions 10.0 mm x 4.5 mm. 
180 mg strength: a peach, film-coated, modified capsule shaped, biconvex tablet debossed with “ ”
on one side of the tablet and ‘DF1’ on the other side. Approx. tablet dimensions 12.8 mm x 6.0 mm. 
360 mg strength: a peach, film-coated, modified capsule shaped, biconvex tablet debossed with “ ” 
on one side of the tablet and ‘DF2’ on the other side. Approx. tablet dimensions 17 mm x 6.7 mm. 
The qualitative composition of the core is identical to that of the reference product. The different strengths 
are dose-proportional. They can be differentiated based upon their size and their markings. No overages 
are used. 
Based on the characterization of reference product i.e. Exjade® tablets 90 mg, 180 mg and 360 mg 
manufactured by Novartis Europharm Ltd., it was determined that the test product should have the 
following attributes: 
1. The product has to be formulated as an immediate release tablets to be administered orally having 
deferasirox as the active ingredient and it has to be pharmaceutically equivalent to the reference product. 
2. The formulation should have comparable dissolution profile with reference product. 
3. The product should have satisfactory pharmaceutical stability. 
4. Test product should be bioequivalent to the reference product. 
5. The test product strengths - 90 mg, 180 mg and 360 mg should be formulated as dose weight 
proportional formulations in order to justify biowaiver of lower strengths - 90 mg and 180 mg. 
Initially, the quality target product profile (QTPP) was defined based on the properties of the drug 
substance, characterization of reference product, consideration of the reference product label and 
intended patient population. 
The excipients used in formulation were selected based on the excipients used in the reference product, 
excipient compatibility study and prior experience of product development.  
Except for the film coating material, all of the excipients used are identical to those used in the reference 
product, and are conventional pharmaceutical ingredients that comply with the requirements of the 
European Pharmacopoeia. They are included in the formulation at suitable levels and for recognized 
purposes. The functionality related characteristics of the excipients have been adequately discussed in 
line with the findings of manufacturing process development, and included in their specification. There are 
no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 
6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
Appropriate TSE/BSE statements regarding safety of the excipients have been provided. 
The film coating material is a proprietary material purchased from an established commercial supplier, to 
an agreed specification. The individual compendial components used in the manufacturing of Opadry 
coating material comply with the respective monograph in Ph. Eur. The colorants used in Opadry coating 
material comply with directive (EU) No. 231/2012. The iron content present in the chosen coating 
material does not significantly affect the iron binding capacity of the active substance.

Risk assessment was carried out throughout development to identify potentially high-risk formulation and 
process variables and to determine which studies were necessary to achieve product and process 
understanding. 
Risk Assessment was performed to identify the formulation variables affecting the proposed critical 
quality attributes (CQAs). The identified formulation variables were studied at various levels and the 
optimized level of each variable was selected based on the desired values of the CQAs. An updated 
formulation risk assessment was found to be satisfactory as the high and medium formulation risks were 
reduced to low. 
Following formulation risk assessment, a similar risk assessment was conducted to evaluate the risk 
associated with various process parameters. Formulations were prepared employing different levels of 
process variables and evaluated for the affected CQAs. The final range of process parameters was 
determined based on the results of these studies. Subsequently, the risk assessment was then updated 
after development to capture the reduced level of risk based on improved process understanding. 
Finally, an adequate control strategy of the material attributes and process parameters were proposed 
which also includes in-process controls and finished product specifications. Monitoring of the process will 
be continued throughout the product lifecycle and the control strategy will be adjusted based on the 
experience gained. 
The chosen formulation and manufacturing process adequately accommodate active substance 
properties. 
Optimization trials were undertaken by varying the concentration of the excipients in the formula. The 
batches were analyzed for weight variation, hardness, thickness, disintegration time, friability and 
dissolution profile. Based on the results, the final product composition was finalized. 
The description of the manufacturing process development is sufficiently detailed. The choice of process 
variables has been adequately justified. 
The effect of the manufacturing process steps on the polymorphic stability of the active substance has 
been adequately investigated. 
Deferasirox is a BCS class II compound which easily penetrates the relevant physiological barriers, and 
possesses poor solubility in the aqueous body fluids. During development of the dissolution method, 
surfactant had to be added to the dissolution medium to produce a measurable dissolved amount of the 
active substance. In spite of efforts taken to optimise dissolution parameters to accommodate the poor 
solubility of deferasirox, sink conditions could not be achieved for the 360 mg strength in all media, nor 
probably for the 180 mg strength. Nevertheless, the discriminatory power of the chosen method has been 
satisfactorily demonstrated. 
The applicant has performed comparative bioequivalence study between Deferasirox 360 mg film coated 
tablets and the reference product Exjade (Deferasirox) 360 mg film coated tablets. The applicant 
confirmed that the composition and the manufacturing process of the test product formulation used in the 
bioequivalence study and the formulation proposed for commercial supplies to the European Economic 
Area is the same. The assay and impurities data of the batches used in the bioequivalence study have 
been provided. The difference in assay of the test and the reference products is less than 5%, as per the 
Guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev 1). The levels of 
impurities are similar. The biobatch has been produced at the proposed finished product manufacturing 
site. The source of active substance has been indicated. Comparative dissolution profiles of the test and 
reference products have been provided. 
A biowaiver is requested for the lower strengths. The conditions necessary for a waiver are fulfilled. In 
order to unambiguously prove similar in vitro behaviour of the test and reference products, lower

strengths of the reference product have also been compared to the respective 90 mg and 180 mg test 
products and found comparable.  
Furthermore, according to the SmPC, “For patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, the 
film-coated tablets may be crushed and administered by sprinkling the full dose onto soft food, e.g. 
yogurt or apple sauce (pureed apple).”  No compatibility study was required due to identical instructions 
in the reference product’s SmPC; and no in-use stability was requested, as according to the SmPC “the 
dose should be immediately and completely consumed, and not stored for future use”. Considering that 
according to the SmPC administration of crushed tablets is also proposed, comparative dissolution profiles 
of crushed and intact tablets have also been provided, additionally a bioequivalence study was performed 
comparing test and reference crushed in apple sauce. 
In addition a new bioequivalence study (No. C18443) was submitted in response to the Day 120 LoQ. The 
study was performed with the additional mode of administration i. e. crushing the tablet, administered 
with soft food (apple sauce). Based on the results of the study with crushed Deferasirox 360 mg 
film-coated tablets (Mylan) and Exjade 360 mg filmovertrukne tabletter (Novartis) (language as written 
in the response documentation) met the bioequivalence criteria with regard to rate and extent of 
absorption under fasting conditions. 
The product is presented in the following pack types: 
PVC/PVDC/Aluminium blister pack and unit-dose blisters.  
• 
•  High density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle pack with opaque polypropylene (PP) screw closure  
The packaging materials are commonly used for storage of oral film-coated tablets, and comply with the 
relevant EC directive requirements for packaging materials in contact with food. The choice of the 
container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process comprises granulation, blending, compression, coating as main steps and can 
be considered as a standard process. 
The detailed narrative description of the process has been provided, as well as the flow chart of the 
process steps. The manufacturing conditions and operating parameters to be followed for the proposed 
commercial batch sizes are in line with the conclusions of the manufacturing process development as 
sufficiently detailed in the respective section. 
In-process control (IPC) tests and criteria have been adequately detailed. The packaging materials of the 
intermediates and holding times, verified by stability studies, have been provided. 
The manufacturing process has been validated for three batches per strength. It has been demonstrated 
that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a 
reproducible manner.  
Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
description (visual), identification (HPLC, UV), identification of colorants (colorimetry), dissolution (UV), 
assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), and loss of drying (Ph.

formulae, typical chromatograms and spectra have been provided. The analytical test methods applied 
were adequately validated in line with ICH Q2 (R1),and are suitable for their intended purpose. The 
stability indicating nature of the methods has been demonstrated by the forced degradation studies. 
Batch analysis 
The presented batch analysis results (3 batches of each strength) confirm the quality, consistency and 
uniformity of the product, and indicate that the process is under control.  
Impurities/degradation products have been evaluated and found to be acceptable from the point of view 
of safety. No additional impurity of deferasirox is observed in the finished product during manufacturing 
or during stability.   
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards has been presented. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release proposed specifications, 
through traditional final product release testing.

conditions. Acceptable bracketing design has been applied for the stability studies in bottles. 
The tested parameters are within the specified limits. No significant changes or trends can be observed for 
any of the tested parameters at any of the tested conditions. The conditions used in the stability studies 
comply with the ICH stability guideline, stability data are available for representative batches (9 batches) 
of all strengths manufactured at the commercial site and packed in the commercial container closure 
systems i.e. the tablets were packed in the container closure system as proposed for marketing i.e. HDPE 
bottle pack and PVC/PVDC/aluminium blister pack. 
Bulk stability study: data have been presented up to 12 months. The tested parameters are within the 
specified limits. No significant changes or trends can be observed for any of the tested parameters at any 
of the tested conditions, except for a slight increase in loss on drying.  
In-use stability: despite a slight increase in loss on drying, all results comply with the requirements. Since 
the tablets packed in bottle packs comply with the proposed shelf-life specification at the end of the 
conducted in-use study, no in-use period is stated in the SmPC in line with EMA Q&A on quality Part 2. 
Photostability study has been performed on one representative batch from each strength as per ICH Q1B 
Guideline- “Photo stability testing of new drug substances and products”, and the results showed that the 
product is not sensitive to light.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which 
is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to 
generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical 
aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. 
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment studies were submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Deferasirox Mylan manufactured by Mylan S.A.S is considered unlikely to result in any 
significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all deferasirox containing products and the 
exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which 
justifies why there is no need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and 
toxicology data. Absence of ERA has been acceptably justified by the applicant. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The application is approvable from a non-clinical perspective.

2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for film-coated tablets containing deferasirox. To support the marketing 
authorisation application the applicant conducted a bioequivalence study with cross-over design under 
fasting conditions. This study was the pivotal study for the assessment. 
Additionally, the applicant conducted a bioequivalence study with cross-over design under fasting 
conditions (light meal and with crushed tablets) in relation to section SmPC 4.2 of the reference product 
‘For patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, the film-coated tablets may be crushed and 
administered by sprinkling the full dose onto soft food, e.g. yogurt or apple sauce.’. 
The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well 
as efficacy and safety of deferasirox based on published literature. The SmPC is in line with the SmPC of 
the reference product. 
No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product.  
For the clinical assessment the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) is of particular relevance. 
GCP 
The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Exemption  
A biowaiver request was submitted for the additional 90 mg and 180 mg strengths according to the 
Bioequivalence Guideline (General biowaiver criteria). 
Since deferasirox is a BCS class II compound that easily penetrates the relevant physiological barriers and 
possesses poor solubility in the aqueous body fluids, the applicant investigated the dissolution in presence 
of surfactant.  
The low solubility of the drug substance was confirmed also with the dissolution profiles without 
surfactant.  
Although it has been demonstrated according to the Guideline on the Investigation of bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **) that similar profiles are obtained with samples of the same 
dose (1x360 mg tablet vs 2x180 mg tablets vs 4x90 mg tablets in a vessel), sink conditions were visibly 
not achievable for all strengths. 
In order to unequivocally prove similar in-vitro behaviour of the test and reference products, lower 
strengths of the reference product were compared to the respective 90 mg and 180 mg test products, 
confirming that low dissolution is drug substance rather than formulation related. Furthermore, 
considering the SmPC of the originator, since it allows the administration of crushed tablets is also 
proposed, comparative disintegration times of the tablets and dissolution profiles of crushed and intact 
tablets were also provided. 
Further dissolution and disintegration tests were performed with Deferasirox Test and Reference (Exjade) 
showing similar dissolution profiles.

Clinical studies 
To support the application, the applicant has submitted one pivotal bioequivalence study in fasting 
conditions. 
Additionally, as part of the responses to the Day 120 LoQ , one supportive study (crushed tablets with 
light meal), was submitted in connection to section SmPC 4.2 of the reference product ‘For patients who 
are unable to swallow whole tablets, the film-coated tablets may be crushed and administered by 
sprinkling the full dose onto soft food, e.g. yogurt or apple sauce.’.

The study population included healthy, non-smoking male volunteers aged between 18 to 45 years 
(included), with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 18.5 kg/m2 and ≤ 30.0 kg/m2 and weight ≥ 50.00 kg. The 
sample size calculation was properly conducted, the choice of population size was N=40. Two subjects 
were withdrawn, thus 38 subjects completed the study. 
Protocol deviations/violations: one protocol deviation occurred during the study period, 
inclusion/exclusion of subject No. 31 due to loose motion in period 2 post-dose. The study validity 
remained unaffected. 
Analytical methods 
The plasma samples of subjects were analysed using LC/MS/MS method for Deferasirox in Human Plasma 
using High Performance and Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography Method with Tandem mass 
spectrometry over a Concentration range of 0.250 μg/mL lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) to 32.618 
μg/mL upper limit of quantification (ULOQ).  
Bioanalytical assay: 13 December 2017 – 21 December 2017.  
The analytical method for the determination of deferasirox in human plasma was validated. The 
validation, partial validations and analytical reports were submitted. CoAs of internal standards and 
analyte standard were presented. Stability of analyte in the plasma samples has been demonstrated. The 
reanalysis using incurred samples confirmed the reproducibility of study samples used in validated 
bioanalytical method.  
During the bioanalysis 299 samples (15.82%) had to be reanalysed because of “QCs did not meet the 
acceptance criteria”. Both assay methods were validated, and appropriate incurred sample reanalysis 
indicated that using UPLC and HPLC technique was acceptable as well.

The bioequivalence results were based on free deferasirox, in line with the requirement as the evaluation 
should be based on the parent compound. 
Pharmacokinetic variables 
Primary Variables:  
Cmax: maximum measured plasma concentration over the time span specified 
AUC0-t: The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve, from time (0) to the last measurable 
concentration (t), as calculated by the linear trapezoidal method. 
Secondary Variables:  
AUC0-inf: The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time (0) to infinity. 
Tmax: Time of the maximum measured plasma concentration. 
Kel: apparent first-order elimination or terminal rate constant calculated from a semi-log plot of the 
plasma concentration versus time curve. 
t1/2: the elimination or terminal half-life is calculated as 0.693/Kel. 
AUC_%Extrap_obs.: The residual area in percentage was determined by the formula [(AUC0-inf – AUC0-t)/ 
AUC0-inf] × 100 
The actual time of blood sample collection were used for estimation of pharmacokinetic parameters, using 
non-compartmental model of Phoenix® WinNonlin® version 6.3. 
Statistical methods 
Statistical analysis was performed on the data obtained assaying concentration of deferasirox in the 
plasma samples collected, using SAS® Software (Version 9.2); SAS Institute Inc., USA, actual time of 
blood sample collection were used for estimation of pharmacokinetic parameters, which was computed 
using non-compartmental model of Phoenix® WinNonlin® version 6.3.  
Descriptive statistics were computed for all primary pharmacokinetic parameters.  
The ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax AUC0-t and AUC0-inf for Deferasirox were subjected 
to Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The model was including Sequence, Formulation, Period and Subject 
(Sequence) as fixed effects. Sequence effect was tested using Subject (Sequence) as error term. An 
F-test was performed to determine the statistical significance of the Formulation and Period effects 
involved in the model at a significance level of 5% (alpha= 0.05) and Sequence effect involved in the 
model at a significance level of 10% (alpha= 0.10). 
Bioequivalence criteria: Bioequivalence of the test product with that of the reference product under 
fasting condition was concluded if the 90% confidence intervals of geometric least square mean ratio of 
the test to reference product falls within the acceptance range of 80.00 % – 125.00% for Cmax and AUC0-t 
for deferasirox. 
Although not pre-specified in the analysis plan, the results of the study have been presented with 
inclusion and also with exclusion of subject No. 31 who developed loose motion.

Supportive PK study No. C18443 (submitted as part of responses to the LoQ) 
This is a randomized, balanced, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence, single-dose, crossover oral 
bioequivalence study of Deferasirox film coated tablets 360 mg of Mylan Laboratories Limited, India with 
Exjade® (deferasirox) 360 mg filmovertrukne tabletter deferasirox of Novartis Europharm Limited, 
Frimley Business Park, Camberley GU16 7SR, UK, in normal healthy adult human subjects under fasting 
conditions.  
The objective of the study was to evaluate oral bioequivalence of Test and Reference deferasirox products 
in thirty four subjects. Two experimental sessions were respectively undertaken from 18/12/2018 to 
22/12/2018 (period-1), and from 26/12/2018 to 30/12/2018 (period-2). In each period, all subjects were 
required to fast overnight for at least 10.00 hours prior to dosing. On dosing day, approximately weighed 
10 grams of apple sauce was dispensed on the spoon at least 3 hours prior to dosing and kept aside. A 
single oral dose of either Test or Reference tablet was crushed using a mortar and pestle. This crushed 
tablet was sprinkled over a spoonful of apple sauce and administered to the subjects with 240 mL of 
ambient temperature water.  
Blood samples were collected for 72 hours in each period, and minimum of eight days washout interval 
was kept between the two periods. All plasma samples were stored at a temperature of -70°C at the 
clinical site until transferred on dry ice to analytical site. 
Bioequivalence was concluded if the 90% confidence intervals of geometric least square mean ratio of the 
T/R product fell within the acceptance range of 80.00 % – 125.00% for Cmax and AUC0-t for Deferasirox. 
Primary log-transformed pharmacokinetic results are presented in Table 3.3.7.

mg film-coated tablets the Test product met the bioequivalence criteria to Reference product 
with regard to rate and extent of absorption under fasting conditions consumed with apple sauce.  
According to PKWP’s proposal, although bioequivalence of crushed Test and Reference products was 
justified, this study can only be considered as a supporting one. The applicant has demonstrated that the 
Reference product has the same lot number (WP827) as in the pivotal study, and the medicinal product 
has been authorised in the EU (EU/1/06/356/018). 
Safety data 
No serious adverse events were observed during the study C17305. By four subjects a total of six adverse 
events were reported over the course of the study, one AE during period-2 in-house and five events 
during post study safety evaluation. 
All of the reported adverse events were mild in severity and possibly related to the study drug.  
The details of AEs from the pivotal trial are presented in table 7 (Display of adverse events).

The requested data about the subjects’ laboratory parameters and vital signs were provided by the 
applicant.  
Conclusions 
Based on the presented bioequivalence studies Deferasirox Mylan is considered bioequivalent with 
Exjade. 
The results of study C17305 with the 360mg formulation can be extrapolated to other strengths, 90 mg 
and 180 mg, according to conditions in the Guidelines and following the in-vitro dissolution tests 
submitted. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application. 
2.4.4.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The submitted bioequivalence study was considered relevant to support the generic documentation of the 
Deferasirox Mylan film-coated tablets. The study seemed adequately designed considering the number of 
randomized subjects, wash-out period, sampling periods, test and reference products. A pre-dose level 
was not detected in any samples, thus it can be concluded that the wash-out period was long enough to 
avoid  carry-over  effect.  Cmax  was  not  observed  in  any  subject  in  the  first  sample  point.  The  point 
estimates and 90% confidence intervals for the ln-transformed pharmacokinetic variables Cmax and AUC 
were within the conventional bioequivalence range of 80.00% - 125.00%. The sponsor presented PK and 
statistical  report  by  including  and  with  excluding  subject  No.  31  as  well.  The  applicant  showed  that 
inclusion of subject No 31 did not have significant impact on the study results. Even if loose motion was 
not pre-defined as exclusion criteria in the protocol, leaving out subject No 31 from pharmacokinetic and 
statistical analysis seems to be acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/509090/2019  
Page 27/37 
 
 
 
 
ANOVA  detected  significant  period  effect  for  the  log-transformed  AUC(0-t)  (p=0.0184)  and  AUC(0-inf) 
(p=0.0340).  The  applicant  ruled  out  reasons  like  different  positioning,  timing  and  degree  of  physical 
activity, timing and composition of food/beverages ingested and explained the issue with possibility of 
different  psychological  status  of  the  subjects  that  could  lead  to  effect  on  blood  concentration  data. 
Nevertheless this significant period effect was not expected by the applicant to influence the comparison 
of test and reference products using 90% confidence interval. The applicant was requested to discuss 
further the influence of this significant period effect on the study outcome.  
The applicant has adequately discussed that the decrease in intra-subject variability can lead to the 
increase of study power, hence the sensitivity of statistical tests may also increase. Consequently, the 
small differences between the periods may become significant. This explanation of the phenomenon 
seems to be acceptable and it can be concluded that the observed significant period effects in AUC-s have 
no influence on the outcome of the bioequivalence study. 
Although, in principle, study C17305 could be considered sufficient to demonstrate the essential similarity 
between the Test and Reference products, there were some issues that needed to be resolved by the 
applicant. Taking into consideration the mode of administration described in the reference product SmPC, 
for patients suffering from swallowing difficulties, the tablets can be administered crushed and dispersed 
with food. Consequently, the applicant had to justify and demonstrate by appropriate in vitro or in vivo 
data that the bioavailability of the active substance is not affected with this additional mode of 
administration namely crushed and dispensed with light meal (apple sauce or yogurt). 
The results of the newly conducted bioequivalence study (No. C18443) with crushed tablets administered 
with apple sauce indicate that this mode of administration does not have significant impact on the 
bioavailability of deferasirox, the increase in tmax and t1/2 parameters seems negligible as well. Thus, 
crushed deferasirox 360 mg film-coated tablets Test product met the bioequivalence criteria to crushed 
360 mg film-coated tablets Reference product with regard to rate and extent of absorption under fasting 
conditions when consumed with apple sauce. Moreover, line extension studies of Exjade (procedure X/43 
film-coated tablets) justified that administration of film-coated tablets in crushed form with applesauce or 
in yoghurt results in comparable absorption. The applicant demonstrated that administration of crushed 
deferasirox film-coated tablets in apple sauce does not have a significant impact on the bioavailability of 
deferasirox, as compared to the intact deferasirox 360 mg film-coated tablets. 
CHMP-PKWP provided the following input on PK 
The applicant has addressed the possibility of ‘crushing’ by submitting an additional bioequivalence study 
comparing Test and Reference taken in crushed with apple sauce. Bioequivalence has been 
demonstrated, confirming that qualitative formulation differences did not result in different 
biopharmaceutic performance when crushed products where compared in vivo. As expressed in the 
respective recently revised PKWP Q&A document (Q & A 3.6 at 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/research-development/scientific-guidelines/clinical-
pharmacology-pharmacokinetics/clinical-pharmacology-pharmacokinetics-questions-answers), this may 
be considered an expected outcome given already demonstrated bioequivalence with intact products. 
In addition, in order to unequivocally prove similar in vitro behaviour of the test and reference products 
and accept the biowaiver for the lower strengths, comparison of the reference product to the respective 
90 mg and 180 mg test products was requested, confirming that low dissolution is drug substance rather 
than  formulation  related  (without  surfactant).  Furthermore,  concerning  the  acceptability  of  the 
alternative administration for the lower strengths in relation to the SmPC of the originator, which allows 
administration  of  crushed  tablets,  comparative  disintegration  times  of  the  test  and  reference  intact 
tablets were also asked to be provided.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/509090/2019  
Page 28/37 
 
 
 
The observed significant period effect in AUCs’ and their influence on the outcome of the bioequivalence 
study was discussed, considering that the decrease in intra-subject variability can lead to the increase of 
study  power,  hence  increasing  the  sensitivity  of  statistical  tests.  Consequently,  the  small  differences 
between the periods may become significant. The explanation and the conclusion of the applicant “as the 
observed  significant  period  effect  in  AUC's  did  not  impact  on  the  study  outcome”  was  considered 
acceptable. 
During the bioanalysis, 299 samples (15.82%) had to be reanalysed because of “QCs did not meet the 
acceptance  criteria”.  As  per  the  explanation,  the  re-assay  of  the  mentioned  samples  (299)  were  in 
accordance with the predefined SOP “CRC-SOP-BIO-TEC-0001” criteria. Due to gradual decrease the QC 
runs failed, and it was noted, that repeat analytical run versus original failed analytical run showed almost 
similar differences in the concentration data as in the QC’s samples. The procedure of re-assay seems 
acceptable. 
HPLC and UPLC were also used for the bioanalysis. Both assay methods were validated, and appropriately 
incurred  sample  reanalysis  indicated  that  using  UPLC  and  HPLC  technique  is  acceptable  as  well.  The 
applicant  provided  the  case  report  forms  of  study  subjects,  and  the  accurate  documentation  of  the 
medicine  concomitantly  administered  a  few  hours  after  intake  of the  2nd  period  investigation  drug  in 
patient No.31 reporting loose motion. All necessary data about the medication and further observation 
were detailed. Handling of this patient during the study seemed to be appropriate. 
Further data about the subjects’ laboratory parameters and vital signs were presented by the applicant.  
The lower pre-study Creatinine clearance was not considered remarkable by the principal investigator of 
Subject No 31 (who had loose motions and was partly excluded from the statistical analyses). Based on 
the SmPC of the originator (Exjade®): “During clinical studies, increases in serum creatinine of >33% on 
≥2 consecutive occasions, sometimes above the upper limit of the normal range, occurred in about 36% 
of patients.”  
Thus the slight increase in post-study creatinine level in this patient does not seem to have a clinical 
relevance either.  
A total of three post study adverse events were reported by three subjects over the course of study No. 
C18443. These laboratory parameter deviations (Eo count / ALAT / Blood bilirubin increased) were mild in 
severity and possibly related to the study drug, however, the subjects were not interested to come for 
repeated safety sample collection therefore were considered as lost to follow-up. 
The applicant confirmed that only free form of deferasirox was measured in the plasma samples which is 
in line with the guideline.  
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
To support this application, the applicant originally submitted one successful bioequivalence study (study 
C17305) with intact tablets, and in the LoQ response document one study with crushed tablets taken with 
apple sauce (study C18443) both in fasting conditions.  
For the originator, the effect of food on the bioavailability of deferasirox has been demonstrated to be (i) 
formulation dependent and (ii) divergent dependent on the fat content of the meal. Since the formulation 
of  the  proposed  Deferasirox  Mylan  film-coated tablets  differs  from that  of  the  originator’s  film-coated 
tablets, the applicant provided an additional study to demonstrate similarity of the food effect. Based on 
the  submitted  data,  light  meal  (apple  sauce,  yoghurt)  has  no  influence  on  the  bioavailability  of 
Deferasirox Mylan 360 mg film-coated tablets, or of the Reference product. Bioequivalence criteria were 
met in study C18443, and the data sufficiently support the claim of essential similarity of tested crushed 
Deferasirox Mylan to the crushed reference medicinal product Exjade.

The CHMP considers that Deferasirox Mylan 360 mg, 180 mg and 90 mg film-coated tablets are 
approvable from a pharmacokinetic point of view.

Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.7.  Product information 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.7.2.  Additional monitoring 
This product does not require additional monitoring. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of deferasirox film-coated tablets. The reference product 
Exjade is indicated for the treatment of iron overload (see detailed indication). No nonclinical studies have 
been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available nonclinical information for 
the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application 
does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and 
safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on 
information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis with an open-label, randomized, balanced, single dose, 
two-period, two-treatment cross-over design. The study design was considered adequate to evaluate the 
bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line with the respective European requirements. Choice of 
dose, sampling points, overall sampling time as well as wash-out period was adequate. The analytical 
method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of Deferasirox Mylan met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when 
compared with Exjade. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters 
AUC0-t,, AUC0-∞, and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of 80.00 to 
125.00%. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
4.  Recommendation 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Deferasirox Mylan is not similar to Revlimid, Zynteglo within 
the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
decision that the benefit-risk balance of Deferasirox Mylan is favourable in the following indication: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/509090/2019  
Page 34/37 
 
 
 
 
Deferasirox Mylan is indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to frequent blood 
transfusions (≥7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) in patients with beta thalassaemia major aged 
6 years and older. 
Deferasirox Mylan is also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions 
when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in the following patient groups: 
- in paediatric patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to frequent blood 
transfusions (≥7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 to 5 years, 
- in adult and paediatric patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to infrequent blood 
transfusions (<7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 years and older, 
- in adult and paediatric patients with other anaemias aged 2 years and older. 
Deferasirox Mylan is also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload requiring chelation therapy 
when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in patients with non-transfusion-dependent 
thalassaemia syndromes aged 10 years and older. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following

being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to launch of Deferasirox Mylan in each Member State the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) 
must agree about the content and format of the educational programme, including communication media,

distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent Authority.  
The educational programme is aimed to inform healthcare professionals and patients to minimise the 
risks of:  
•  Non-compliance of the posology and biological monitoring  
•  Medication errors due to switching between formulations available on the market by different 
MAHs (dispersible tablets and film-coated tablets/granules). 
The MAH shall ensure that, at launch, in each Member State where Deferasirox Mylan is marketed, all 
healthcare professionals and patients who are expected to prescribe, dispense and use Deferasirox Mylan 
are provided with the following educational package:  
•  Physician educational material  
•  Patient information pack  
Additional periodic distributions after launch should be performed, notably after substantial safety 
modifications of the product information justifying educational material updates. 
The physician educational material should contain:  
•  The Summary of Product Characteristics  
•  Guide for healthcare professionals 
The Guide for healthcare professionals shall contain the following key elements: 
•  Description of available deferasirox formulations on the market (e.g. dispersible tablets, 
• 
• 
• 
film-coated tablets and granules) 
o  Different posology regimen 
o  Different conditions of administration 
o  Dose conversion table when switching from one formulation to another 
The recommended doses and the rules for starting treatment 
The need to monitor serum ferritin monthly 
That deferasirox causes rises in serum creatinine in some patients 
o  The need to monitor serum creatinine 
  On two occasions prior to initiation of treatment 
 
Every week during the first month of initiation of treatment or after therapy 
modification 
  Monthly thereafter 
o  The need to reduce by 10 mg/kg the dose if serum creatinine rises: 
  Adults: >33% above baseline and creatinine clearance <LLN (90 ml/min) 
 
Paediatrics: either >ULN or creatinine clearance falls to <LLN at two consecutive 
visits. 
o  The need to interrupt treatment after a dose reduction if serum creatinine rises: 
  Adults and Paediatrics: remain >33% above baseline or creatinine clearance 
<LLN (90 ml/min) 
o  The need to consider renal biopsy: 
  When serum creatinine is elevated and if another abnormality has been detected 
(e.g. proteinuria, signs of Fanconi syndrome).

The importance of measuring creatinine clearance 
• 
•  Brief overview of methods of measuring creatinine clearance 
• 
That rises in serum transaminases may occur in patients treated with Deferasirox Mylan 
o  The need for liver function tests prior to prescription, then at monthly intervals or more 
often if clinically indicated 
o  Not to prescribe to patients with pre-existing severe hepatic disease 
o  The need to interrupt treatment if persistent and progressive increase in liver enzyme 
were noted. 
The need for annual auditory and ophthalmic testing 
The need for a guidance table highlighting pre-treatment measurements of serum creatinine, 
creatinine clearance, proteinuria, hepatic enzymes, ferritin, such as: 
• 
• 
Before initiating treatment 
Serum creatinine at Day – X  
Serum creatinine at Day – Y  
Value 1 
Value 2 
           X and Y are the days (to be determined) when pre-treatment measurements should be 
performed. 
•  A warning on the risk of overchelation and on the necessity of close monitoring of serum ferritin 
levels and renal and hepatic function. 
• 
The rules for treatment dose adjustments and interruption when target serum ferritin +/- liver 
iron concentration are reached. 
•  Recommendations for treatment of non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia (NTDT) syndromes: 
Information that only one course of treatment is proposed for NTDT patients 
o 
o  A warning on the necessity of closer monitoring of liver iron concentration and serum 
ferritin in the paediatric population  
o  A warning on the currently unknown safety consequences of long-term treatment in the 
paediatric population 
The patient information pack should contain:  
 
 
Patient information leaflet  
Patient guide  
Patient guide should contain the following key elements: 
 
Information on the need for regular monitoring, and when it should be carried out, of serum 
creatinine, creatinine clearance, proteinuria, hepatic enzymes, ferritin  
Information that renal biopsy may be considered if significant renal abnormalities occur  
 
  Availability of several oral formulations (e.g. dispersible tablets, film-coated tablets and granules) 
and the main differences associated with these formulations (i.e., different posology regimen, 
different conditions of administration notably with food)

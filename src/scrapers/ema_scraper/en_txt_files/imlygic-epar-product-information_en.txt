CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Imlygic is indicated for the treatment of adults with unresectable melanoma that is regionally or 
distantly metastatic (Stage IIIB, IIIC and IVM1a) with no bone, brain, lung or other visceral disease 
(see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with talimogene laherparepvec should be initiated and supervised by a qualified physician 
experienced in the treatment of cancer. 
Patients treated with Imlygic must be given the Patient Alert Card and be informed about the risks of 
the treatment (see also Package leaflet). 
Posology 
Imlygic is provided in single-use vials of 1 mL each in two different concentrations: 
• 
• 
106 (1 million) PFU/mL - For initial dose only. 
108 (100 million) PFU/mL - For all subsequent doses. 
The total injection volume for each treatment visit should be up to a maximum of 4 mL. The initial 
recommended dose is up to a maximum of 4 mL of Imlygic at a concentration of 
106 (1 million) PFU/mL. Subsequent doses should be administered up to 4 mL of Imlygic at a 
concentration of 108 (100 million) PFU/mL.

Determining Imlygic dose volume (per lesion) 
The volume to be injected into each lesion is dependent on the size of the lesion and should be 
determined according to table 2. The total injection volume for each treatment session should be up to 
a maximum of 4 mL.

Patients may experience increase in size of existing lesion(s) or the appearance of a new lesion prior to 
achieving a response. As long as there are injectable lesion(s) remaining, Imlygic should be continued 
for at least 6 months unless the physician considers that the patient is not benefitting from Imlygic 
treatment or that other treatment is required. 
Imlygic treatment may be reinitiated if new lesions appear following a complete response and the 
physician considers that the patient will benefit from treatment. 
Special populations 
Elderly population 
No adjustment of the dose is required in patients ≥ 65 years old (see section 5.1). 
Hepatic and renal impairment 
No clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic or renal impairment on the 
pharmacokinetics of talimogene laherparepvec. However, no adjustment in dosage is necessary for 
patients with hepatic or renal impairment. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Imlygic in paediatric patients has not been established. No data are 
available.

Method of administration 
Imlygic is to be administered by intralesional injection into cutaneous, subcutaneous, and/or nodal 
lesions that are visible, palpable or detectable by ultrasound guidance. 
Precautions to be taken before manipulating or administering the medicinal product 
This medicinal product contains genetically modified organisms. Personal protective equipment 
should be worn while preparing or administering talimogene laherparepvec (see section 6.6). 
Healthcare professionals who are immunocompromised or pregnant should not administer Imlygic and 
should not come into direct contact with the injection site(s) or body fluids of treated patients (see 
sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
Follow the instructions below to prepare and administer Imlygic to patients: 
Pre-injection 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Injection 
• 
Thaw Imlygic vial(s) at room temperature. Thawed vials may be stored prior to administration 
(see section 6.3). For handling of thawed vials, see section 6.6. 
Draw the desired amount of Imlygic from the vial into a syringe using aseptic technique. A 22- 
to 26-gauge needle is recommended. 
The injection site may be treated with a topical anaesthetic agent. Injectable anaesthetic may be 
injected around the periphery of the lesion but should not be injected directly into the lesion. 
Clean the lesion and surrounding areas with an alcohol swab and let dry. 
Inject Imlygic intralesionally into cutaneous, subcutaneous, and/or nodal lesions that are visible, 
palpable or detectable by ultrasound guidance. 
Determine injection volume for each lesion using table 2 above. 
Using a single insertion point, inject Imlygic along multiple tracks as far as the radial reach of 
the needle allows within the lesion to achieve even and complete dispersion. Multiple insertion 
points may be used if a lesion is larger than the radial reach of the needle.

• 
Disperse Imlygic evenly and completely within the lesion by pulling the needle back without 
exiting the lesion. Redirect the needle as many times as necessary while injecting the remainder 
of the dose. Continue until the full dose is evenly and completely dispersed. 
•  When removing the needle, withdraw it from the lesion slowly to avoid leakage or splash back 
• 
of Imlygic at the insertion point. 
Repeat these steps for other lesions that need to be injected. Use a new needle anytime the 
needle is completely removed from a lesion and each time a different lesion is injected.

Post-injection 
• 
• 
Apply pressure to the injection site with a sterile gauze for at least 30 seconds. 
Swab the injection site and surrounding area with alcohol, and cover the injected lesion with an 
absorbent pad and dry occlusive dressing. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to talimogene laherparepvec or any of its excipients. 
Patients who are severely immunocompromised (e.g. patients with severe congenital or acquired 
cellular and/or humoral immune deficiency) (see section 4.4). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Previously treated patients 
Efficacy data for Imlygic in the current second or later line treatment settings are limited. 
Disseminated Herpetic Infection 
Disseminated herpetic infection, including serious cases of disseminated herpetic infection, have been 
reported in patients treated with Imlygic (see section 4.8). 
Imlygic has not been studied in immunocompromised patients. Based on epidemiological data, 
immunocompromised patients (such as those with HIV/AIDS, leukaemia, lymphoma, common 
variable immunodeficiency, or who require chronic high-dose steroids or other immunosuppressive 
agents) may be at increased risk of disseminated herpetic infection. Consider the risks and benefits of 
treatment before administering Imlygic to immunocompromised patients. 
Based on animal data, patients who are severely immunocompromised may be at an increased risk of 
disseminated herpetic infection and should not be treated with Imlygic (see sections 4.3 and 5.3).  
Accidental exposure to Imlygic 
Accidental exposure may lead to transmission of Imlygic and herpetic infection. Healthcare 
professionals and close contacts (e.g. household members, caregivers, sex partners or persons sharing 
the same bed) should avoid direct contact with injected lesions or body fluids of treated patients during 
the entirety of the treatment period and up to 30 days after the last treatment administration (see 
section 6.6). Accidental needle stick and splash-back have been reported in healthcare professionals 
during preparation and administration. 
Close contacts who are pregnant or immunocompromised should not change the patient’s dressing or 
clean their injection site. Pregnant women, neonates, and immunocompromised individuals should not 
be exposed to potentially contaminated materials. 
Healthcare professionals should ensure that patients are able to comply with the requirement to cover 
injection sites with occlusive dressings (see section 6.6). Patients should also be advised to avoid 
touching or scratching injection sites as this could lead to inadvertent transfer of Imlygic to other areas 
of their body or to their close contacts. 
Although it is not known if Imlygic could be transmitted through sexual contact, it is known that 
wild-type HSV-1 can be transmitted through sexual contact. Patients should be advised to use a latex 
condom during sexual contact to prevent possible transmission of Imlygic. Women of childbearing 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
potential should be advised to use an effective method of contraception to prevent pregnancy during 
treatment (see section 4.6). 
Caregivers should be advised to wear protective gloves when assisting patients in applying or 
changing occlusive dressings and to observe safety precautions for disposal of used dressings and 
cleaning materials (see section 6.6). 
In the event of an accidental exposure to Imlygic, follow instructions in section 6.6. If signs or 
symptoms of herpetic infection develop, exposed individuals should contact their healthcare 
professional. In case suspected herpetic lesions occur, patients, close contacts or healthcare providers 
have the option of follow-up testing by the Marketing Authorisation Holder for further 
characterisation of the infection. 
Herpetic infection in Imlygic-treated patients 
Herpetic infections (including but not limited to cold sores and herpes keratitis) and serious cases of 
disseminated herpetic infections have been reported in patients treated with Imlygic (see section 4.8). 
Symptoms of a local or systemic infection possibly related to Imlygic are anticipated to be similar to 
symptoms caused by wild-type HSV-1 infections. 
Individuals with wild-type HSV-1 infection are known to be at a lifelong risk for symptomatic 
herpetic infection due to reactivation of latent wild-type HSV-1. Symptomatic herpetic infection due 
to possible reactivation of Imlygic should be considered. 
Patients who develop herpetic infections should be advised to follow standard hygienic practices to 
prevent viral transmission. 
Talimogene laherparepvec is sensitive to acyclovir. The risks and benefits of Imlygic treatment should 
be considered before administering acyclovir or other anti-viral agents indicated for management of 
herpetic infection. These agents may interfere with the effectiveness of the treatment if administered 
systemically or topically directly to the injection site. 
Information on herpetic lesions is provided in the Patient Alert Card. 
Cellulitis at the injection site 
Necrosis or ulceration of tumour tissue may occur following Imlygic treatment. Cellulitis and systemic 
bacterial infection have been reported. Careful wound care and infection precautions are 
recommended, particularly if tissue necrosis results in open wounds. 
Impaired healing at the injection site 
In clinical studies, impaired healing at the injection site has been reported. Imlygic may increase the 
risk of impaired healing in patients with underlying risk factors (e.g. previous radiation at the injection 
site, or lesions in poorly vascularised areas). 
The risks and benefits of Imlygic should be considered before continuing treatment if persistent 
infection or delayed healing develops. 
Immune-mediated events 
In clinical studies, immune-mediated events including as glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, pneumonitis, 
worsening psoriasis, and vitiligo have been reported in patients treated with Imlygic. 
The risks and benefits of Imlygic should be considered before initiating treatment in patients who have 
underlying autoimmune disease or before continuing treatment in patients who develop 
immune-mediated events. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Plasmacytoma at injection site 
Plasmacytoma has been reported in proximity to the injection site after administration of Imlygic. The 
risks and benefits of Imlygic should be considered in patients with multiple myeloma or in whom 
plasmacytoma develops during treatment. 
Obstructive airway disorder 
Obstructive airway disorder has been reported following Imlygic treatment. Caution should be used 
when injecting lesions close to major airways. 
HSV-1 seronegative patients 
Patients who were HSV-1 seronegative at baseline were reported to have a greater incidence of 
pyrexia, chills, and influenza-like illness compared with those who were HSV-1 seropositive at 
baseline, especially within the period of the first 6 treatments (see section 4.8). 
Hepatic Haemorrhage from Transcutaneous Intrahepatic Route of Administration 
Imlygic is not indicated for transcutaneous intrahepatic route of administration. In clinical studies, 
cases of hepatic haemorrhage resulting in hospitalisation and death have been reported in patients 
receiving transcutaneous intrahepatic Imlygic injections. 
All patients 
This medicinal product contains 20 mg sorbitol per 1 mL vial. The additive effect of concomitantly 
administered products containing sorbitol (or fructose) and dietary intake of sorbitol (or fructose) 
should be taken into account. 
This medicinal product contains 7.7 mg sodium per 1 mL vial, equivalent to 0.4% of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been conducted with Imlygic. Acyclovir and other anti-viral agents may 
interfere with the effectiveness of the treatment if administered systemically or topically directly to the 
injection site. Consider the risks and benefits of Imlygic treatment before administering acyclovir or 
other anti-viral agents indicated for management of herpetic infection. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/contraception 
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use an effective method of contraception to 
prevent pregnancy during treatment. 
All patients should be advised to use a latex condom during sexual contact to prevent possible 
transmission of Imlygic (see section 4.4). 
Pregnancy 
Adequate and well controlled studies with talimogene laherparepvec have not been conducted in 
pregnant women. 
If a pregnant woman has an infection with wild type HSV-1 (primary or reactivation), there is 
potential for the virus to cross the placental barrier, and also a risk of transmission during birth due to 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
viral shedding. Infections with wild-type HSV-1 have been associated with serious adverse effects, 
including multi-organ failure and death, if a foetus or neonate contracts the wild type herpes infection. 
While there are no clinical data to date on talimogene laherparepvec infections in pregnant women, 
there could be a risk to the foetus or neonate if talimogene laherparepvec were to act in the same 
manner. No effects on embryo-foetal development have been observed in animal studies (see 
section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of talimogene laherparepvec 
during pregnancy. 
Transplacental metastases of malignant melanoma can occur. Because talimogene laherparepvec is 
designed to enter and replicate in the tumour tissue, there could be a risk of foetal exposure to 
talimogene laherparepvec from tumour tissue that has crossed the placenta. 
If Imlygic is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking the medicinal 
product, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazards to the foetus and/or neonate. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether talimogene laherparepvec is transferred into human milk. A decision must be 
made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Imlygic therapy taking into 
account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
No clinical studies have been performed to evaluate the effects of talimogene laherparepvec on 
fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Talimogene laherparepvec may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Because of potential adverse reactions such as dizziness and confusional state (see section 4.8), 
patients should be advised to use caution when driving or operating machinery until they are certain 
that talimogene laherparepvec does not adversely affect them. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
The safety of Imlygic was evaluated in the pivotal study where 292 patients received at least 1 dose of 
Imlygic (see section 5.1). The median duration of exposure to Imlygic was 23 weeks (5.3 months). 
Twenty-six (26) patients were exposed to Imlygic for at least one year. 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥ 25%) in Imlygic-treated patients were fatigue 
(50.3%), chills (48.6%), pyrexia (42.8%), nausea (35.6%), influenza-like illness (30.5%), and injection 
site pain (27.7%). Overall, 98% of these adverse reactions reported were mild or moderate in severity. 
The most common grade 3 or higher adverse reaction was cellulitis (2.1%) (see section 4.4). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions were determined based on clinical trials in patients with melanoma treated with 
Imlygic compared to GM-CSF and post-marketing experience. Incidence of adverse reactions are 
presented by system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), 
common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) and uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100). Within each frequency grouping, 
adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Immune-mediated events 
Immune-mediated events reported in the pivotal clinical study included a case of worsening psoriasis 
in a patient with a prior history of psoriasis, one case of pneumonitis in a patient with a prior history of 
autoimmune disease, one case of vasculitis, and two cases of glomerulonephritis of which one 
presented with acute renal failure. 
Plasmacytoma 
In clinical trials, one case of plasmacytoma at injection site was observed in a patient who was found 
to have multiple myeloma. 
Cellulitis 
In the pivotal clinical trial (study 005/05), events of cellulitis were recorded, some of them being 
considered as serious adverse events. However, none lead to permanent discontinuation of Imlygic 
treatment. Careful wound care and infection precautions are recommended, particularly if tissue 
necrosis results in open wounds. 
Influenza-like symptoms 
Ninety percent (90%) of patients treated with Imlygic experienced influenza-like symptoms. Pyrexia, 
chills, and influenza-like illness, which can occur any time during treatment, generally resolved within 
72 hours. These events were reported more frequently within the period of the first 6 treatments, 
particularly in patients who were HSV-1 negative at baseline. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is no clinical experience with overdose with Imlygic. Doses up to 4 mL at a concentration of 
108 PFU/mL every 2 weeks have been administered in clinical trials with no evidence of dose limiting 
toxicity. The maximum dose that can be safely administered has not been determined. In the event of a 
suspected overdose or inadvertent intravenous administration, the patient should be treated 
symptomatically, e.g. with acyclovir or other anti-viral agents (see section 4.4) and supportive 
measures instituted as required.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents, ATC code: L01XX51. 
Mechanism of action 
Talimogene laherparepvec is an oncolytic immunotherapy that is derived from HSV-1. Talimogene 
laherparepvec has been modified to replicate within tumours and to produce the immune stimulatory 
protein human GM-CSF. Talimogene laherparepvec causes the death of tumour cells and the release 
of tumour-derived antigens. It is thought that together with GM-CSF, it will promote a systemic 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
anti-tumour immune response and an effector T-cell response. Mice that had complete regression of 
their primary tumours following treatment were resistant to subsequent tumour re-challenge. 
The modifications to talimogene laherparepvec from HSV-1 include deletion of ICP34.5 and ICP47. 
Whereas anti-viral immune responses defend normal cells following infection by talimogene 
laherparepvec, tumours have been shown to be susceptible to injury and cell death from 
ICP34.5-deficient HSV-1 viruses, including talimogene laherparepvec. Deletion of ICP47 prevents 
down-regulation of antigen presentation molecules and increases the expression of HSV US11 gene, 
thereby enhancing viral replication in tumour cells. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Study 005/05 
The safety and efficacy of Imlygic monotherapy compared with subcutaneously administered 
GM-CSF were evaluated in a phase 3, multinational, open-label, and randomised clinical study of 
patients with stage IIIB, IIIC, and IV melanoma that was not considered to be surgically resectable. 
Previous systemic treatment for melanoma was allowed but not required. Patients with active brain 
metastases, bone metastases, extensive visceral disease, primary ocular or mucosal melanoma, 
evidence of immunosuppression, or receiving treatment with a systemic anti-herpetic agent were 
excluded from the study. 
Patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive either Imlygic or GM-CSF (N = 436; 295 Imlygic, 
141 GM-CSF). Imlygic was administered by intralesional injection at an initial concentration of 
106 (1 million) PFU/mL on day 1, followed by a concentration of 108 (100 million) PFU/mL on day 21 
and every 2 weeks thereafter at a dose of up to 4 mL. GM-CSF was administered subcutaneously at 
125 µg/m2 delivered daily for 14 days followed by a 14-day rest period in repeating intervals. 
To allow for delayed immune-mediated anti-tumour effects to occur, patients were treated for a 
minimum of 6 months or until there were no longer any injectable lesions. During this period, 
treatment was to continue despite an increase in size in existing lesion(s) and/or development of new 
lesion(s) unless the patient developed intolerable toxicity or the investigator believed that it was in the 
best interest of the patient to stop treatment or to be given other therapy for melanoma. After 6 months 
of treatment, patients were to continue treatment until clinically relevant disease progression (i.e. 
disease progression associated with a decline in performance status and/or alternative therapy was 
required in the opinion of the investigator). Patients experiencing a response at 12 months of treatment 
could continue treatment for up to an additional 6 months. The mean (SD) treatment duration for the 
intent-to-treat (ITT) population was 15.76 weeks (15.79) in the GM-CSF arm and 26.83 weeks (18.39) 
in the Imlygic arm. The primary endpoint was durable response rate (DRR) [defined as the percent of 
patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) maintained continuously for a minimum 
of 6 months] per blinded central review. The secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), 
overall response rate (ORR) [PR+CR], time to response, duration of response, and time to treatment 
failure (time from randomisation until the first episode of clinically relevant disease progression where 
there is no response achieved after the progression event, or until death). 
The mean age was 63 (range: 22 to 94) years; 26.5% were over 65 years old and 23.3% were over 
74 years old. The majority of patients, 98%, were caucasian. Male patients comprised 57% of study 
population and 70% of patients were baseline ECOG 0 performance status. Of the enrolled patients, 
22% had stage IV M1c disease and 53% of patients had received prior therapy for melanoma such as 
chemotherapy and cytokine-based immunotherapy in addition to surgery, adjuvant therapy or 
radiation. Overall, 58% of all patients enrolled into the study were seropositive for wild-type HSV-1 at 
baseline and 32.6% were seronegative; the HSV-1 serostatus of the remaining 9.4% was unknown. 
The difference in DRR between Imlygic and GM-CSF in the ITT population was statistically 
significant (see table 4) in favour of Imlygic.

Among the Imlygic-treated responders, 56 (72%) responses were still ongoing at the time of primary 
analysis. Of the responders, 42 (54%) experienced a ≥ 25% increase in overall size of existing 
lesion(s) and/or developed a new lesion(s) prior to ultimately achieving a response. 
In an analysis to evaluate systemic activity of Imlygic, 27 of 79 patients (34.2%) had a ≥ 50% overall 
decrease in non-visceral lesions that were not injected with Imlygic, and 8 of 71 patients (11.3%) had 
a ≥ 50% overall decrease in visceral lesions that were not injected with Imlygic.

No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between elderly (≥ 65 years old) and 
younger adult patients. 
Exploratory subgroups 
Exploratory subgroup analyses for DRR and overall survival by stage of disease were also carried out 
(see figure 5 and table 5). While the pivotal study was not powered to evaluate efficacy in these 
individual subgroups, patients with no visceral disease derived greater benefit from Imlygic treatment 
than those with more advanced disease.

Due to the exploratory nature of the analysis and based on the current evidence, it has not been 
established that Imlygic is associated with an effect on overall survival. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Imlygic in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in melanoma (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Talimogene laherparepvec is a genetically modified and replication-competent HSV-1 virus. 
Therefore, its pharmacokinetics and biodistribution are driven by the site of intralesional injection, 
tumour-selective replication, and release from tumour tissue. 
Absorption 
Cellular uptake of talimogene laherparepvec occurs through HSV-1 receptors on tumours and 
non-tumour cells following local injection into tumours. As talimogene laherparepvec is injected and 
replicates intratumourally, bioavailability and systemic concentration of talimogene laherparepvec are 
not predictive of drug substance activity and therefore have not been evaluated. 
Metabolism/elimination 
Talimogene laherparepvec is cleared through general host-defence mechanisms (e.g. autophagy, 
adaptive immune responses). Talimogene laherparepvec is degraded by typical endogenous protein 
and DNA catabolic pathways. As with other wild-type HSV-1 infections, a latent pool of talimogene 
laherparepvec DNA may persist in neuronal cell bodies innervating the injection sites; therefore, the 
occurrence of latent infection with talimogene laherparepvec cannot be excluded. 
Biodistribution (within the body) and viral shedding (excretion/secretion) 
Talimogene laherparepvec DNA was quantified with a highly sensitive and specific quantitative 
Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) assay which may not correlate with viral infectivity risk. 
Talimogene laherparepvec was also quantified in selected patient samples in clinical studies using 
viral infectivity assays at the injection sites and in some cases of potential herpetic lesions. 
Clinical biodistribution, elimination, and shedding 
The biodistribution and shedding of intralesionally administered talimogene laherparepvec were 
investigated in a clinical study that measured talimogene laherparepvec DNA in blood, urine, injection 
site, exterior of the occlusive dressings, oral mucosa, anogenital area, and suspected herpetic lesions. 
Sixty patients with melanoma received Imlygic intralesional injection at a dose and schedule same as 
clinical study 005/05 (see section 5.1). Occlusive dressings samples were collected during treatment. 
Blood and urine samples were collected during treatment and for up to 30 days after the end of 
treatment. Injection site, oral mucosa, and anogenital area samples were collected during treatment and 
for up to 60 days after the end of treatment. Suspected herpetic lesion samples were collected any time 
a patient experienced lesions of suspected herpetic origin. If the qPCR testing for talimogene 
laherparepvec DNA was positive, then a TCID50 assay was performed to measure viral infectivity. In 
the 60 patients treated, data indicate that talimogene laherparepvec DNA was present in all sites during 
the study (see table 6).

a For the anogenital area, 26 patients were tested for Imlygic DNA. 
The proportion of samples and subjects with talimogene laherparepvec DNA was highest during cycle 
2 of treatment for the blood, urine, injection site, and occlusive dressings; highest in cycle 1 of 
treatment for the oral mucosa; and highest in cycles 1 and 2 for the anogenital area. Among patients 
with detectable talimogene laherparepvec DNA in the blood, urine, oral mucosa, and anogenital area, 
no samples had detectable talimogene laherparepvec DNA 30 days after the end of treatment. For 
patients with detectable DNA in injected lesions, no samples had detectable talimogene laherparepvec 
DNA 60 days after end of treatment. 
Overall 3 of 19 patients with lesions of suspected herpetic origin had talimogene laherparepvec DNA 
present at any time during the study. Viral activity was measured in samples that were positive for 
talimogene laherparepvec DNA from the injection site, occlusive dressings, oral mucosa, anogenital 
area, and suspected herpetic lesions. No viral activity was detected in samples of the occlusive 
dressings, oral mucosa, anogenital area, and suspected herpetic lesions. Infectious talimogene 
laherparepvec virus was detected at the site of injection in 7 (11%) patients at multiple time points in 
the study; no samples were positive for viral infectivity after cycle 2 or after the end of treatment. 
Pharmacokinetics in special populations 
No pharmacokinetic studies using talimogene laherparepvec have been conducted in special 
populations. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
At doses up to 4 x 108 PFU/kg or 107 PFU/dose (60-fold over the highest proposed clinical dose), 
single or repeated doses of talimogene laherparepvec administered by SC, IV, or intratumoural 
injection were well tolerated in immunocompetent mice, rats, and dogs. No neuropathology or adverse 
neurological effects were observed. In an in vivo study of intracerebral injection, talimogene 
laherparepvec was 10,000-fold less neurovirulent as compared to the wild-type HSV-1 dose that 
results in death 50% of the time in mice. 
Talimogene laherparepvec was injected into various xenograft tumours at doses up to 2 x 108 PFU/kg 
(30-fold over the highest proposed clinical dose) in immunodeficient mice (nude and SCID). Lethal 
systemic viral infection was observed in up to 20% of nude mice (primarily deficient in T lymphocyte 
function) and 100% of SCID mice (devoid of both T and B lymphocytes). 
Across studies, fatal disseminated viral infection was observed in 14% of nude mice following 
treatment with talimogene laherparepvec at doses that are 10- to 100-fold higher than those that result 
in 100% lethality with wild-type HSV-1. 
Mutagenicity 
The genotoxic potential of talimogene laherparepvec has not been evaluated in long-term animal or 
human studies. Because wild-type HSV-1 does not integrate into the host genome, the risk of 
insertional mutagenesis with talimogene laherparepvec is negligible. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Carcinogenicity 
The carcinogenic potential of talimogene laherparepvec has not been evaluated in long-term animal or 
human studies. However, available data for talimogene laherparepvec and wild-type HSV-1 do not 
indicate a carcinogenic risk in humans. 
Reproductive and development toxicity 
There were no impacts to male or female reproductive tissues following treatment of adult mice at 
doses up to 4 x 108 PFU/kg (60-fold higher, on a PFU/kg basis, compared to the maximum clinical 
dose). No effects on embryo-foetal development were observed when talimogene laherparepvec was 
administered during organogenesis to pregnant mice at doses up to 4 x 108 (400 million) PFU/kg 
(60-fold higher, on a PFU/kg basis, compared to the maximum clinical dose). Negligible amounts 
(< 0.001% of maternal blood levels) of talimogene laherparepvec DNA were found in foetal blood.

6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
Thawing Imlygic vials 
• 
• 
Before use, thaw frozen Imlygic vials at room temperature (20°C to 25°C) until Imlygic is 
liquid. The time to achieve complete vial thaw is expected to be 30 to 70 minutes, depending on 
the ambient temperature. Gently swirl. Do NOT shake. 
Vials should be thawed and stored in the original carton until administration in order to protect 
from light. 
Handling and Administration 
Follow local guidelines for handling and administration, personal protective equipment, accidental 
spills, and waste disposal. 
•  Wear protective gown or laboratory coat, safety glasses, or face shield and gloves while 
preparing or administering Imlygic. Cover any exposed wounds before administering. Avoid 
contact with skin, eyes or mucous membranes. 
After administration, change gloves prior to applying occlusive dressings to injected lesions. 
Wipe the exterior of occlusive dressing with an alcohol wipe. It is recommended to keep 
injection sites covered with airtight and watertight dressings at all times, if possible. To 
minimise the risk of viral transmission, patients should keep their injection site covered for at 
least 8 days from the last treatment or longer if the injection site is weeping or oozing. Advise 
patients to apply dressing as instructed by the healthcare professional and to replace the dressing 
if it falls off. 
Dispose of all materials that have come in contact with Imlygic (e.g. vial, syringe, needle, any 
cotton or gauze) in accordance with local procedures. 
• 
• 
Accidental exposure 
• 
• 
• 
In the event of an accidental occupational exposure to Imlygic (e.g. through a splash to the eyes 
or mucous membranes) during preparation or administration, flush with clean water for at least 
15 minutes. In the event of exposure to broken skin or needle stick, clean the affected area 
thoroughly with soap and water and/or disinfectant. 
Treat all Imlygic spills with a virucidal agent and absorbent materials. 
Advise patients to place used dressings and cleaning materials in a sealed plastic bag as they 
may be potentially contaminated, and to dispose of the bag in household waste. 
This medicine contains genetically modified organisms. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Imlygic is and what it is used for 
Imlygic is used to treat adult patients with a type of skin cancer called melanoma that has spread in the 
skin or to the lymph nodes, when surgery is not an option. 
The active ingredient of Imlygic is talimogene laherparepvec. This is a weakened form of herpes 
simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1), which is commonly called the cold sore virus. To get Imlygic from 
HSV-1, the virus has been changed so that it multiplies more effectively in tumours than in normal 
cells. This leads to destruction of infected tumour cells. This medicine also works by helping your 
immune system to recognise and destroy tumours throughout your body. 
2.  What you need to know before and during Imlygic treatment 
You will not be given Imlygic: 
- 
if you are allergic to talimogene laherparepvec or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). 
if your healthcare professional has told you that you have a severely weakened immune system. 
- 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your healthcare professional before being given this medicine. 
Life-threatening herpes infection 
Life-threatening herpes infection including spreading to any part of the body far from the injection site 
(disseminated herpetic infection) may occur. If you have any new or worsening symptoms, tell your 
healthcare professional immediately. Tell your healthcare professional if you have or have ever had a 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
weakened immune system, if you have HIV/AIDS, blood or bone marrow cancer, or if you are taking 
steroids or other medicines that suppress your immune system because you may be at increased risk of 
life-threatening herpes infection. 
Accidental spread of Imlygic to yourself and others 
Imlygic can be spread to other parts of your body or to other people through direct contact with your 
body fluids or injection sites. 
You should do the following to avoid spreading Imlygic to other areas of your body or to your close 
contacts (close contacts include household members, caregivers, sex partners, or someone you share a 
bed with): 
• 
Avoid direct contact between your injection sites or body fluids (e.g. blood and urine) and close 
contacts (e.g. use latex condoms when engaging in sexual activity, avoid kissing close contacts 
if either of you has an open mouth sore) while you are being treated with this medicine and up 
to 30 days after your last dose. 
Avoid touching or scratching the injection sites. 
Keep injection sites covered with airtight and watertight dressings at all times. Apply the 
dressing as instructed by your healthcare professional. If the dressing comes loose or falls off, 
replace it immediately with a clean dressing. 
Place all used dressings and cleaning materials in a sealed plastic bag and throw them away in 
your household waste. 
• 
• 
• 
You should tell your close contacts to: 
• 
•  Wear gloves while changing your dressing. 
Avoid direct contact with your body fluids or injection sites. 
If your close contacts are accidentally exposed to Imlygic, they should clean the affected area on their 
body with soap and water and/or a disinfectant. If they develop signs or symptoms of herpes infection, 
you should ask them to contact their healthcare professional. If herpetic lesions (blisters or sores) are 
suspected, patients or close contacts have the option of follow-up testing by the Marketing 
Authorisation Holder for further characterisation of the infection. Please discuss with your healthcare 
professional. 
Close contacts who are pregnant or who have a weakened immune system, and newborns 
Ensure that your close contacts who are pregnant or who have a weakened immune system do not 
touch injection sites, used dressings and cleaning materials. Keep used dressings and cleaning 
materials away from newborns. 
Herpes infection 
Cold sores or a more serious herpes infection may occur during or after treatment with Imlygic. Signs 
and symptoms related to treatment with Imlygic may be the same as for herpes infections, and include 
but are not limited to pain, burning or tingling in a blister around the mouth, genitals, on the fingers or 
ears, eye pain, light sensitivity, discharge from the eyes, or blurry vision, weakness in arms or legs, 
extreme drowsiness (feeling sleepy), and mental confusion. If you have these signs or any new 
symptoms, you should follow standard hygiene practices to prevent viral transmission to others. If 
herpetic lesions (blisters or sores) are suspected, patients or close contacts have the option of follow-
up testing by the Marketing Authorisation Holder for further characterisation of the infection. Please 
discuss with your healthcare professional. 
Infection and delayed healing at injection site 
Imlygic may cause infection at the injection site. Signs and symptoms of infection include pain, 
redness, warmth, swelling, discharge or a sore (ulcer), fever, and chills. The injection site may take 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
longer to heal than normal. You should tell your healthcare professional if you notice any of these 
symptoms. 
Autoimmune reactions 
Imlygic may cause autoimmune reactions (an over-reaction of the body’s immune system). Some 
people taking this medicine have developed inflammation in the kidneys (glomerulonephritis), 
narrowing or blockage of blood vessels (vasculitis), swelling of the lungs (pneumonitis), worsening 
skin scaling (psoriasis), and areas of skin without any colour (vitiligo). Inform your healthcare 
professional if you have a history of autoimmune disease. 
Plasmacytoma 
Imlygic may cause cancerous white blood cells to gather at or near the injection site (plasmacytoma). 
Inform your healthcare professional if you have a history of blood cancer including multiple myeloma. 
Difficulty breathing 
If you have a tumour in your neck, your healthcare professional may warn you that you might 
experience compression of your airways during treatment. 
Patients with no prior herpes infection 
If you have never had herpes infection in the past, you may be more likely to get fever, chills, and 
flu-like illness within the period of the first 6 treatments. 
Children and adolescents 
Imlygic is not recommended for children and adolescents since the effects of this medicine in people 
younger than 18 years old are not known. 
Other medicines and Imlygic 
Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines, such as acyclovir, to treat or prevent herpes infections. Acyclovir and 
other anti-viral treatments may decrease the effects of Imlygic. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Ask your healthcare professional for advice if you: 
• 
• 
Your healthcare professional will determine if Imlygic is right for you. 
think you may be pregnant; or 
are planning to have a baby. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, ask your healthcare professional for advice before being given 
this medicine. Imlygic may harm your unborn baby. 
Women who are able to become pregnant should use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy 
during treatment with Imlygic. Talk to your healthcare professional about suitable methods of 
contraception. 
It is not known whether Imlygic passes into breast milk. It is important to tell your healthcare 
professional if you are breast-feeding or plan to do so. They will then help you decide whether to stop 
breast-feeding, or whether to stop taking Imlygic, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to 
the baby and the benefit of Imlygic to you. 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Driving and using machines 
When you are being treated with Imlygic you may experience symptoms such as dizziness or 
confusion. This may impair your ability to drive or operate machinery. Use caution when driving or 
operating machinery until you are certain that this medicine does not adversely affect you. 
Imlygic contains sodium and sorbitol 
This medicine contains 7.7 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 1 mL vial. This 
is equivalent to 0.4% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. 
This medicine contains 20 mg sorbitol in each 1 mL vial. 
3.

Subsequent doses will be up to 4 mL of Imlygic at a concentration of 108 (100 million) PFU/mL. 
Your healthcare professional will inject this medicine directly into your tumour(s) with a needle and a 
syringe. Your second injection will be given 3 weeks after the first injection. After that, you will 
receive injections every 2 weeks for as long as you have the tumour(s). 
Your healthcare professional will decide which tumour(s) to inject and may not inject every tumour. 
Your existing tumour(s) may increase in size and new tumour(s) could appear while you are being 
treated with Imlygic. 
You can expect to be treated with Imlygic for at least 6 months or longer.

Thawing Imlygic vials 
• 
• 
Before use, thaw frozen Imlygic vials at room temperature (20°C to 25°C) until Imlygic is 
liquid. The time to achieve complete vial thaw is expected to be 30 to 70 minutes, depending on 
the ambient temperature. Gently swirl. Do NOT shake. 
Vials should be thawed and stored in the original carton until administration in order to protect 
from light. 
After thawing 
• 
• 
• 
After thawing, administer Imlygic as soon as practically feasible. 
Thawed Imlygic is stable when stored at temperatures of 2°C up to 25°C protected from light in 
its original vial, in a syringe, or in the original vial followed by a syringe. Do not exceed the 
storage times specified in table 1 and table 2. 
If storing thawed Imlygic in the original vial followed by a syringe: 
o 
the same temperature range should be maintained throughout the duration of storage until 
administration. 
the storage time in the syringe at ambient temperature up to 25°C cannot exceed 2 hours 
for 106 (1 million) PFU/mL and 4 hours for 108 (100 million) PFU/mL (see table 1). 
the maximum cumulative storage time (storage time in vial plus storage time in syringe) 
cannot exceed the durations in table 2.

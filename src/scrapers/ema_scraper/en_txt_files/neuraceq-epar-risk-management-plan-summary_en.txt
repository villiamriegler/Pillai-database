Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan     
Summary of risk management plan for Neuraceq 
(florbetaben (18F)) 
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  Neuraceq.  The  RMP  details 
important risks of Neuraceq, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about Neuraceq's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Neuraceq's  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Neuraceq should be 
used.  
This summary of the RMP for Neuraceq should be read in the context of all this information 
including  the  assessment  report  of  the  evaluation  and  its  plain-language  summary,  all 
which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of 
Neuraceq's RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Neuraceq  is  authorised  for  Positron  Emission  Tomography  (PET)  imaging  of  β-amyloid 
neuritic plaque density in the brains of adult patients with cognitive impairment who are 
being evaluated for Alzheimer’s disease (AD)  and other causes  of  cognitive impairment. 
Neuraceq should be used in conjunction with a clinical evaluation. (see SmPC for the full 
indication).  It  contains  florbetaben  (18F)  as  the  active  substance  and  it  is  given  by 
intravenous injection. 
Further information about the evaluation of Neuraceq’s benefits can be found in 
Neuraceq’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, 
under the medicine’s webpage 
http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/002
553/human_med_001716.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d124.  
II.  Risks  associated  with  the  medicine  and  activities  to 
minimise or further characterise the risks  
Important  risks  of  Neuraceq,  together  with  measures  to  minimise  such  risks  and  the 
proposed studies for learning more about Neuraceq's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
 
 
 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. 
with or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  the  case  of  Neuraceq,  these  measures  are  supplemented  with  additional  risk 
minimisation measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected 
continuously and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action 
can  be  taken  as  necessary.  These  measures  constitute  routine  pharmacovigilance 
activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Neuraceq is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  Neuraceq  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to 
further  investigate  or  minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely 
administered.  Important risks can be  regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks 
are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Neuraceq. Potential 
risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based 
on  available  data,  but  this  association  has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further 
evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product 
that  is  currently  missing  and  needs  to  be  collected  (e.g.  on  the  long-term  use  of  the 
medicine).

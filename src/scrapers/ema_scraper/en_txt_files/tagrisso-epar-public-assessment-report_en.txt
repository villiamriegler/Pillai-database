2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Lung cancer is an aggressive, heterogeneous, and life-threatening disease. It has been one of the most common 
cancers in the world for several decades (1.8 million new cases in 2012, 12.9% of all new cancers worldwide 
(GLOBOCAN 2012). In the EU, lung cancer is ranked as the fourth most frequent cancer; approximately 313,000 
new cases were diagnosed in 2012 (Ferlay et al. 2013). Furthermore, lung cancer incidence rates were two-fold 
higher in males compared to females (1,241,601 and 583,100, respectively). It is also the most common cause 
of death from cancer worldwide, estimated to be responsible for nearly 1 in 5 cancer deaths (1.59 million 
deaths; 19.4% of all deaths from cancer) in 2012, including 168,000 deaths in the US and 268,000 deaths in 
Europe (GLOBOCAN 2012).  NSCLC represents approximately 80 to 90% of all lung cancers (Cataldo et al 2011, 
Herbst et al 2008).  For the minority of patients with NSCLC who have resectable disease, surgery offers the best 
chance of cure (Mountain 1997).  Despite progress in early detection and treatment, NSCLC is most often 
diagnosed at an advanced stage and has a poor prognosis (Herbst et al 2008).  Once NSCLC has progressed to 
a locally advanced or metastatic stage there is no cure and treatment is therefore focused on extending life, 
delaying disease progression, and improving symptoms and quality of life. 
Progress in molecular biology has changed the therapeutic approach to NSCLC, and the treatment of advanced 
NSCLC can now be guided by the presence of certain mutations, e.g., epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), 
or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). 
Since the discovery of the common somatic mutations in the kinase domain of EGFR in 2004 (Lynch et al 2004), 
NSCLC patients with activating EGFR mutations in exons 18-21 of EGFR (including L858R and exon 19 deletions 
[Ex19del], collectively described as EGFRm) are considered a subset of NSCLC in terms of pathogenesis, 
prognosis and treatment. 
In recent years, studies have identified the presence of EGFR mutations in approximately 10% of patients with 
lung cancer in the European Economic Area (EEA) (Barlesi et al 2013, Esteban et al 2015, Gahr et al 2013, Rosell 
et al 2009). Overall, EGFR mutations have been found to be more frequent in never smokers, in patients with the 
adenocarcinoma histologic subtype, and in women.  Their prevalence is also higher in East Asian patients than 
in Caucasian patients (ESMO clinical practice guidelines [Reck et al 2014]). 
There is a large body of evidence showing consistent efficacy of EGFR TKIs in patients with sensitizing EGFR 
mutations and that these patients are more likely to benefit from initial treatment with an EGFR TKI in 
preference to doublet chemotherapy (Maemondo et al 2010, Mitsudomi et al 2010, Mok et al 2009, Rosell et al 
2012, Zhou et al 2011, Wu et al 2014).   
First- or second-generation EGFR TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib) would generally be considered first choice 
treatment for patients with activating mutations in EGFR, offering ORRs of approximately 60-70% and median 
PFS of 9 to 14 months (NCCN guidelines, ESMO clinical practice guidelines [Reck et al 2014], Sebastian et al 
2014). 
Despite achieving very good initial response rates and durable benefit following treatment with approved TKI 
drugs targeting EGFRm, these patients will eventually develop treatment resistant disease after 9-14 months 
(Jackman et al 2009, Mok et al 2009, Oxnard et al 2011, Maemondo et al 2010, Mitsudomi et al 2010, Rosell et 
al 2012, Sebastian et al 2014). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/15445/2016 
Page 9/134 
  
  
 
Survival rates of patients with advanced NSCLC who progress following treatment with EGFR-TKI remain very 
low, with a median overall survival of 1 to 2 years (Fukuoka et al 2011, Katakami et al 2013, Miller et al 2012, 
Mok et al 2014, Wang et al 2012, Wu et al 2010, Yu et al 2013). 
Treatment following progression on EGFR TKI therapy is guided by patient performance status, symptoms, and 
extent of disease (NCCN Guidelines). Patients have traditionally been treated with chemotherapy. 
Second-line platinum-based chemotherapy post EGFR TKI for EGFRm NSCLC generally provides response rates 
in the range of 20 to 30% (Gridelli et al 2012, Goldberg et al 2012, Maemondo et al 2010, Mok et al 2014, Wang 
et al 2012, Wu et al 2010).   
Median PFS with platinum-containing doublet chemotherapy is generally reported to be in the range of 3 to 6 
months (2nd-line), as was seen in the IMPRESS study (median 5.4 months). 
Following progression on an EGFR TKI and doublet chemotherapy, the only remaining options are re-challenge 
with EGFR TKI, or salvage chemotherapy (usually single-agent), or investigational agents through clinical trials 
(Langer et al 2012).

Patients with local or gradual disease progression may benefit from continued EGFR TKI therapy past objective 
disease progression, as a patient’s tumour may have a meaningful population of cells still sensitive to an EGFR 
TKI.  Many other novel agents and combinations have tried to overcome the acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs, 
but response rates were quite limited; with response rates generally lower than 10% (e.g., EGFR 
TKI+everolimus response rate 0% [Riely et al 2007]; neratinib response rate 3% [Sequist et al 2010a], IPI-504 
response rate 4% [Sequist et al 2010b]).  The combination of afatinib plus the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab 
has shown an overall response rate of 29% and PFS <5 months, that is similar to that of chemotherapy in an 
unselected 2nd-line population (Janjigian et al 2014).  
There are multiple mechanisms for acquired resistance, e.g.: amplification of the mesenchymal epithelial 
transition (MET) proto-oncogene, which activates an AKT-mediated signalling pathway, bypassing the EGFR; 
BRAF mutations; HER2 amplification; even histologic changes, i.e. transformation to small-cell or 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition.  
However, the most common cause of acquired resistance (50-60%) is the EGFR T790M point mutation. Initially 
thought to simply exclude binding of EGFR-TKI drugs by steric hindrance, the substitution of methionine for 
threonine at position 790 in exon 20 is suggested to cause resistance by restoring the EGFR affinity for ATP, thus 
decreasing the binding of the reversible ATP-competitive TKIs, gefitinib and erlotinib (Herbst et al 2008, 
Kobayashi et al 2005, Pao et al 2005, Su et al 2012, Yu et al 2013).  
Several studies showed that patients who acquired the T790M mutation after EGFR TKI therapy had longer 
post-progression survival than those without it, associated with less metastatic sites and a better performance 
status. In this sense, the acquired T790M mutation may be indicative of a more indolent disease (Oxnard et al 
2011). There also is increasing evidence that a low level of the T790M mutation exists before treatment in many 
patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC and may predict a worse PFS on e.g. erlotinib, compared to those without 
pre-treatment T790M (Inukai et al 2006). Currently there is no approved targeted therapy for the T790M 
‘gatekeeper’ mutation.

About the product 
Osimertinib is a TKI and an irreversible inhibitor of EGFRs harbouring sensitising-mutations (EGFRm) and 
TKI-resistance mutation T790M. 
In vitro studies have demonstrated that osimertinib has high potency and inhibitory activity against EGFR across 
a range of all clinically relevant EGFR sensitising-mutant and T790M mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
cell lines (apparent IC50s from 6 nM to 54 nM against phospho EGFR). This leads to inhibition of cell growth, 
while showing significantly less activity against EGFR in wild type cell lines (apparent IC50s 480 nM to 1.8 μM 
against phospho-EGFR). In vivo oral administration of osimertinib leads to tumour shrinkage in both EGFRm and 
T790M NSCLC xenograft and transgenic mouse lung tumour models.  
The applicant applied for an accelerated procedure for the following indication:  
TAGRISSO is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR T790M 
mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed on or after EGFR TKI therapy. 
The recommended indication is: 
TAGRISSO is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic epidermal growth 
factor receptor (EGFR) T790M mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
Treatment with osimertinib should be initiated by a physician experienced in the use of anticancer therapies. The 
recommended dose of TAGRISSO is 80 mg osimertinib once a day until disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity. When considering the use of osimertinib as a treatment for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, it is 
necessary that EGFR T790M mutation status is determined by a clinical laboratory using a validated test method 
If dose of TAGRISSO is missed, the dose should be made up unless the next dose is due within 12 hours. 
TAGRISSO can be taken with or without food at the same time each day. 
Dose adjustments 
Dosing interruption and/or dose reduction may be required based on individual safety and tolerability. If dose 
reduction is necessary, then the dose of TAGRISSO should be reduced to 40 mg taken once daily. 
Dose reduction guidelines for adverse reactions toxicities are provided in Table 2.

Figure 1:  Structure of osimertinib mesylate 
The structure of osimertinib was inferred from the route of synthesis and confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR 
spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. 
The active substance is a non-hygroscopic crystalline solid with pH dependent aqueous solubility: slightly soluble 
at pH 1.2, sparingly soluble in pH 4.5 buffer and very slightly soluble in pH 7 buffer. These properties are 
adequate for an oral solid dosage form. Only one polymorphic form is known despite extensive polymorph 
screening. Osimertinib is achiral. 
Osimertinib is considered a new active substance from a quality perspective. The applicant compared its 
structure with active substances within authorised products in the EU and demonstrated that it is not a salt, 
ester, ether, isomer, mixtures of isomers, complex or derivative (e.g. pro-drug or metabolite) of any of them. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Osimertinib is synthesized by a single manufacturer in four main steps using well-defined starting materials with 
acceptable specifications. The process was developed by the MAA before out-sourcing to the proposed 
commercial manufacturer. 
A reworking procedure has been described to purify active substance which does not meet its specification. This 
is considered acceptable. 
Critical steps have been defined and the in-process controls (IPCs) used to ensure the process performs as 
expected are described. Suitable specifications for isolated intermediates, starting materials and reagents have 
been presented. 
The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered to be 
comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. The synthetic route has remained the 
same with only minor changes to reagents and solvents which do not adversely impact the quality of the active 
substance. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised. The control strategy for a series of potentially mutagenic impurities has been devised 
in accordance with ICH M7 and ICH S9 since the product is intended to treat patients with advanced small cell 
lung cancer. Either suitable limits have been set in the active substance specification or efficient purge by the 
synthetic process has been demonstrated. 
Critical quality attributes of the active substance have been defined as appearance, identity, assay and organic 
impurities. These properties are all controlled by tests in the active substance specification. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/15445/2016 
Page 14/134 
 
 
  
  
 
The active substance is packed in a container which complies with Commission Regulation (EU) No 10/2011. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (active moiety and counter ion - 
FT-IR), assay (LC), impurities (LC), residual solvents (GC), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), particle size 
distribution (laser diffraction) and water content (KF).  
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by toxicological 
and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. One mutagenic impurity has been identified 
and its level is set in line with ICH guidelines M7 (assessment and control of DNA reactive (mutagenic) impurities 
in pharmaceuticals to limit genotoxic risk) and S9 (nonclinical evaluation for anticancer pharmaceuticals). The 
identification test is specific for the mesylate salt so no separate identification test for the counter ion is needed. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standard used 
for assay testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on 36 batches of the active substance were provided. The batches were all analysed 
according to the analytical methods and met with the specifications in place at the time they were manufactured 
and released. Of these, 11 were production scale batches analysed with the current analytical methods. The 
results were within the current specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on three pilot scale batches manufactured by the MAA rather than the intended commercial 
supplier, but using the same process, and stored in the intended commercial package for up to 12 months under 
long term conditions (25 °C / 60% RH), up to 12 months under intermediate conditions (30 °C / 65% RH) and 
for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 °C / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided. The following parameters were tested: description; assay; organic impurities; particle size 
distribution; polymorphic form; water content; microbiological quality. The analytical methods used were the 
same as for release and are stability indicating. All tested parameters were well within specification at all 
time-points and no significant trends were observed. 
Supportive information from two earlier smaller scale batches manufactured using slightly modified routes 
(same sequence, different reagents) were also provided which also showed that the active substance is stable. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch (and one supportive batch) 
and the active substance shown not to be photosensitive. 
Solid state stress testing was carried out up to 50 °C at ambient humidity. Solution state (or as a suspension if 
not soluble) degradation studies were carried out at pH 1, 7 and 13 or in the presence of an oxidant. Osimertinib 
is thermally and acid stable. Degradation is observed under basic, neutral and oxidative conditions. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the 
proposed retest period of 12 months in the proposed container.

Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/15445/2016

The aim was to develop an immediate release dosage form containing either 40 or 80 mg of active substance. 
Film-coated tablets were chosen for the commercial presentation. Their cores are manufactured from a common 
granule blend and coated to form bioconvex, beige tablets of different sizes and debossed with their respective 
strengths in order to readily distinguish them. The quality target product profile (QTPP) was defined as 
immediate release dosage form containing osimertinib, that meets compendial and other relevant quality 
standards for appearance, identity, assay, impurities, uniformity of dosage units, dissolution, disintegration, 
hardness and friability. 
Osimertinib is a non-hygroscopic solid with poor flow properties although other mechanical properties render it 
suitable for tableting. Only one polymorphic form is known and it exhibits pH dependent solubility in aqueous 
media with maximal solubility in weak acids. Permeability is formally low and so osimertinib is classed as BCS III 
although data suggested high enough permeability that it won’t limit absorption. A series of different 
formulations was prepared during development including an oral solution used in early development, a powder 
in capsule formulation used in phase I, a film-coated tablet also used in phase I and the final commercial 
formulation used in phases I, II and III clinical trials. Sequential in vivo bioavailability studies were carried out 
in order to bridge between successive clinical trials. In parallel, in vitro dissolution studies demonstrated that 
differences in dissolution rate do not translate to differences in bioequivalence, further indicating that dissolution 
rate is not crucial to bioavailability. The phase I capsules contain the same excipients as those planned for 
commercialisation but in different proportions. Lower strength tablets were also used in phase I. The levels of 
lubricant, disintegrant and filler were optimised in order to improve product performance and manufacture. The 
amount of film coating mixture was also optimised to impart more consistent dissolution and appearance. A 
further in vitro dissolution study demonstrated the equivalence of tablets manufactured at the development and 
proposed commercial manufacturing sites. 
Compatibility with the chosen core tablet and film coating excipients was shown using multi-variate design of 
experiments (DoE) under stressed conditions (high temperature/RH). Very little degradation was observed, 
indicating no compatibility issues. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is 
compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The 
list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.2.1 of this report. 
Risk assessment was used to guide development activities. The potential impact of individual formulation unit 
operations and the various input materials on quality attributes of the finished product was assessed and those 
deemed likely to be important were investigated experimentally. Material attributes (MAs) and process 
parameters (PPs) were set at appropriate levels to guarantee finished product quality and manufacturability 
based on these investigations. The overall control strategy is a combination input MAs, PPs, IPCs and finished 
product testing. No design space is applied for. 
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method was investigated using batches manufactured with 
significant deviations in the most critical manufacturing parameters. In all instances, rapid release was achieved 
across the physiological pH range. Therefore, none of the manufacturing variables is considered critical to the 
dissolution behaviour of Tagrisso tablets. According to ICH Q6A, decision tree #7 (2), discriminatory power does 
not need to be demonstrated under such circumstances. The performance of the product is guaranteed by input 
material attributes, IPCs, and controlling the process under GMP within pre-determined limits. 
The primary packaging is Alu/Alu blisters. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice 
of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product.

EMA/CHMP/15445/2016

The applicant submitted a post-approval change management protocol (PACMP) for an additional primary 
packaging format, PVC/PVDC/Alu blisters. The Alu/Alu blister format was selected to provide a high barrier to 
water ingress. However, stability studies, including an open dish study at high humidity (40 oC / 75% RH) have 
shown that although an increase in water content is observed, this doesn’t adversely impact the performance of 
the tablets with no change in assay, degradants or dissolution profile noticeable. Therefore, the medium 
moisture barrier provided by the PVC/PVDC/Alu format will provide sufficient protection. The PACMP is 
considered acceptable as is the reporting category IA IN B.II.g.5.a. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  six  main  steps:  blending  of  intra-granular  excipients  followed  by 
lubrication;  roller  compaction  and  milling;  lubrication  of  granules;  compression;  film-coating;  packing.  The 
process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process and as such, validation will be performed before 
the  product  is  launched.  An  acceptable  process  validation  scheme  has  been  provided.  Major  steps  of  the 
manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. The critical steps are defined and suitable 
controls  are  applied.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  capable  of  producing  the 
finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type 
of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications are appropriate for this kind of dosage form and include tests for 
appearance, identification (UV, LC), assay (LC), degradation products (LC), dissolution (Ph. Eur.) and uniformity 
of dosage units (LC). The omission of a test for microbial quality was justified according to ICH Q6A (Decision 
Tree #8) in that evidence has been provided which indicates that the finished product has growth inhibitory 
properties. The water content of Tagrisso film-coated tablets is routinely low at release and after storage, and so 
no test for water content is needed. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the 
ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standard used for assay testing has been 
presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for seven batches of 40 mg tablets and nineteen batches of 80 mg tablets, 
manufactured at pilot to production scale confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability 
to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data on three batches of each strength of tablet manufactured at ≥10% of commercial scale stored for 
up to 12 months under long term conditions (25 °C / 60% RH), up to 12 months under intermediate conditions 
(30 °C / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 °C / 75% RH) in line with the ICH 
guidelines was provided. The batches of Tagrisso were manufactured by the proposed commercial process 
although two smaller scale 40 mg batches were made at a different site. Otherwise, the batches are identical to 
and packed in the same primary packaging as those proposed for marketing. Identical studies on samples stored 
in bulk packaging (aluminium bag in rigid container) were also carried out. Samples were tested for according to 
the release specifications with the omission of the dose uniformity and the inclusion of a test for microbial quality 
at some time-points. The analytical procedures used are the same as for release and were shown to be stability 
indicating.

No changes to any of the measured parameters were observed under any condition other than a small but 
notable increase in one specified degradation product. However, its level remained well within specification after 
12 months and is predicted to do so, based on statistical analysis of the trends, over a 2 year period. Similar 
trends were observed for finished product stored in bulk packaging. 
In addition, one batch of each strength was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability 
Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. No significant changes to any of the measured parameters were 
observed, indicating that Tagrisso is not photosensitive.  
The batches were also stored under stressed conditions (50 oC / ambient RH and 40 oC / 75% RH / open 
container). The results indicate that Tagrisso is thermally stable but picks up up to 1 weight% water in a humid 
environment. However, this has no impact on other quality parameters or the product performance. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 18 months without special storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
A PACMP for an additional packaging format was deemed acceptable, as was the variation classification which 
will be used to report the change. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The pivotal safety pharmacology, toxicology and toxicokinetic studies submitted to support this application were 
conducted in rats and dogs in compliance with GLP regulations. The dose range finding studies do not claim GLP

Acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs 
T790M, as an acquired resistance mechanism across multiple independent populations of PC9 cells, was not 
detected following chronic treatment with osimertinib (see figure below).

In vivo studies 
Tumour growth regression was investigated following oral treatment with daily doses of osimertinib of mice 
bearing EGFRm and EGFRm/T790M or wild-type EGFR xenograft tumours.

Table 9: Summary of xenograft % growth inhibition studies across models after 14 daily doses of 
osimertinib 
Xenograft growth regression with osimertinib was accompanied by dose and time-dependent pharmacodynamic 
inhibition of phospho-EGFR (pEGFR) together with key downstream biomarkers phospho-AKT (pAKT) and 
phospho-ERK (pERK) across mutant and wild-type EGFR disease models in vivo (data not shown).  
Osimertinib pharmacology caused tumour regression in transgenic disease models at low oral doses that align 
with clinical dose levels. Daily oral administration of 25 mg/kg of osimertinib resulted in profound and sustained 
growth regression in a PC9 brain metastasis model in vivo (data not shown). 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Osimertinib and its two metabolites, AZ5104 and AZ7550, were tested in a panel of in vitro radioligand binding, 
enzyme activity and functional assays covering a diverse range of receptors, ion channels, transporters and 
enzymes to explore their pharmacological profiles. 
The table below shows those targets with <100 fold selectivity over primary target IC50 (osimertinib, AZ5104 
and AZ7550 have IC50 values of ≤12, ≤6 and ≤56 nM, respectively, at isolated mutant EGF receptors).

Safety pharmacology programme 
Osimertinib has been evaluated in a panel of safety pharmacology studies to examine potential effects on the 
cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory and central nervous systems.  
There were no notable effects of osimertinib on the respiratory, visual or central nervous systems in rats 
following administration of single doses up to 100 mg/kg in GLP safety pharmacology studies. (Study 3464SR, 
GLP).  
Osimertinib inihibited the human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) encoded potassium channel in Chinese 
hamster ovary cells in vitro (study number VKS0795/0403SZ, GLP) with an IC50 of 0.69 μM indicating a 
potential to cause prolongation of the QT interval.  
In the GLP dog cardiovascular study (Study 1352ZD), administration of single oral doses of osimertinib (0, 6, 20 
and 60 mg/kg) to conscious telemetered dogs was associated with marginal differences in QTcR (up to 7 
increase) and heart rate (up to 20% decrease) compared to the vehicle control in all three dosing groups. Group 
mean plasma concentrations at the lowest dose (6 mg/kg) were 0.516, 0.0150 and 0.0713 µM for osimertinib, 
AZ5104 and AZ7550, respectively.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/15445/2016 
Page 24/134 
 
 
 
  
  
 
In a non-GLP investigative study in the anaesthetized guinea pig (study 0264SG), intravenous infusion of 
osimertinib was associated with small decreases in heart rate (up to 7%) and +ve dP/dtmax (an index of cardiac 
contractility; up to 18%) and increases in left ventricular systolic pressure (up to 10%), PR interval (up to 7%), 
QTcB interval (up to 7%) and QRS duration (up to 26%). These findings were only seen at very high exposures 
(total plasma concentrations of 22.87 µM) and not at the lower dose of 5 mg/kg (total plasma concentrations of 
4.76 µM). 
Dose-dependent increases in blood pressure were seen in the rat telemetry study (study PH E 14191) at oral 
doses of 50 mg/kg and above (NOEL at 20 mg/kg). Exposure of osimertinib was based on extrapolation from 
other studies would be expected to be comparable to the human Cmax at the 80 mg dose (0.635 μM). There 
were no effects on blood pressure in the GLP dog telemetry study (osimertinib group mean Cmax up to 2.51 μM) 
or in the 1 month dog study. Some increases in blood pressure were noted during the 14 day dog dose range 
finding study, but these were confined to poorly tolerated doses (20 mg/kg) or above. The clinical relevance of 
the observed increased blood pressure is uncertain. 
Osimertinib inhibited GI transit in the rat at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No studies were submitted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Non-clinical absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) studies were submitted. These studies 
used the same species and where possible the same strains of laboratory animal (mouse, rat, and dog) that 
were used in the pharmacology, general toxicology and reproductive toxicology studies. Tissue distribution was 
investigated in albino and partially pigmented rats.  In vitro investigations were performed in isolated human 
tissue and in animal or insect derived tissue that expressed specific human drug metabolism and transport 
proteins.  Metabolite identification was conducted following a single dose to human volunteers and on steady 
state plasma samples from patients. 
The multi-analyte analytical methods used to assay osimertinib, and N-desmethyl metabolites AZ5104 and 
AZ7550 in preclinical pharmacokinetic and toxicology studies employed LC-MS/MS. 
Absorption  
Osimertinib absorption was moderate to high in preclinical species with bioavailabilities of 24-37% in rat (study 
8308627) and 115% in dog (study 197725). Exposure increased approximately in proportion to increasing dose. 
Absorption was prolonged with Tmax typically being achieved at 2-4 h or later following higher doses in 
toxicology studies. 
Osimertinib has a moderate to high volume of distribution in rat (12-13 L/kg) and dog (18 L/kg) which is 
consistent with the lipophilic and basic physico-chemical properties of the compound and with the observation 
that tissue concentrations were higher than blood in the rat QWBA study.  Plasma clearances were 2.6 and1.8 
L/h/kg in male and female rats and ~1.3 L/h/kg in the dog.  The combination of moderate clearance and volume 
of distribution results in half lives of 2-5 h in rat and 5-13 h in dog. The half-life after oral dosing was longer than 
after IV which may indicate prolonged absorption of osimertinib. Half-lives in preclinical species were shorter 
than in humans where a half-life of 55.06 h was calculated after an 80 mg human capsule dose. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/15445/2016 
Page 25/134 
  
  
 
In rats, osimertinib exposure was up to 2 fold higher in female rats than males, which is consistent with the sex 
difference in clearance, and exposure increased approximately in proportion to dose in both sexes. Following 
daily dosing of between 4 and 40 mg/kg for 1 month to rats of both sexes, exposure was largely unchanged upon 
multiple dosing.   
In male and female dogs, exposure was similar. Osimertinib exposure increased approximately in proportion to 
dose between 2 and 20 mg/kg.  A slight accumulation was observed after 2 weeks and maintained at 4 weeks 
dosing in the 1 month toxicology study, consistent with the half-life in the dog (approximately 10 h). 
Distribution 
Tissue distribution  
The tissue distribution of radiolabelled osimertinib was evaluated in study KMR002, in partially pigmented and 
albino rats. 
In male partially pigmented rats, drug-related material was slowly absorbed and widely distributed at the early 
sampling times, with tissue concentrations typically higher than in blood. The highest concentrations of 
radioactivity were observed at 6 hours post-dose in uvea plus retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), inner renal 
cortex, bile ducts, pituitary, spleen, renal cortex, lung and Harderian gland. Radioactivity was still evident in 
42% of tissues measured at 60 days after dosing. 
The pattern of distribution in albino rats was, with the exception of melanin containing tissues, qualitatively 
similar to those observed in male partially pigmented rats at comparable times. 
The central nervous system (i.e., brain and spinal cord) contained quantifiable radioactivity up to 21 days 
post-dose, suggesting that osimertinib drug-related radioactivity crosses the blood brain barrier to some extent. 
This was also supported by a study in SCID tumour bearing mice, with osimertinib brain to plasma AUC ratios up 
to 2.8. 
Protein binding 
The protein binding of osimertinib has not been determined due to instability in human plasma and non-specific 
binding issues.  
However, a preliminary investigation of the plasma protein binding of osimertinib, AZ5104 and AZ13597550 at 
100 µM (study ID VKS0890, see table below) indicated that the binding was high for each compound in all the 
species investigated, although a specific value could not be assigned for osimertinib and AZ7550 due to 
non-specific binding issues in the ultrafiltration collection tube. A computational model was used to predict the 
human protein binding. The prediction for AZ5104 was the same as that measured (98% bound) suggesting that 
the binding of osimertinib (99% predicted) and AZ7550 (98% predicted) were likely to be at least as high as for 
AZ5104.

Table 12: Preliminary binding of osimertinib incubated at 100 μM to mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, guinea 
pig and human plasma and human serum albumin (HSA) and α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) in vitro by 
ultrafiltration 
Blood/plasma ratio 
osimertinib related material was mostly distributed into the blood cells. The distribution increased with time and 
was higher in male rats at all-time points.  
In male dogs, after oral dosing the [14C] blood/plasma ratio was approximately 1 at all time points. After 
intravenous dosing, the ratio decreased from 1.4 at the first time point (5 min) to approximately 1 after 6 hours 
where it remained constant up to 168 h. 
Covalent binding 
Osimertinib binds covalently to rat and human plasma proteins, human serum albumin and rat and human 
hepatocytes (Studies 120118-CVB-KXZZ856, 111123-CVB-KXZZ856, KMN006).  
Placental transfer 
No studies have been conducted. 
Metabolism 
The metabolism of osimertinib has been investigated in vitro in mouse, rat, dog and human hepatocytes, in 
isolated recombinant cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes and in humans. No preclinical in vivo metabolism studies 
have been conducted. 
Results from study ADME 025 showed that the metabolism of osimertinib was primarily to oxidative and 
dealkylated products with direct conjugation to a range of glutathione, cysteineglycine, glucuronide and 
sulphate conjugates. All metabolites formed in human hepatocytes were seen in incubations with rat and dog 
hepatocytes. Only 2 metabolites were detected between 1-10 % in human hepatocytes: the de-methylated M3 
and the oxidated M4. The de-methylated plasma metabolites M3 (AZ7550) and M6 (AZ5104) are active 
metabolites. 
In a panel of CYP isoforms, CYP3A4 was the principal CYP enzyme responsible for the metabolism of osimertinib 
although CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2E1 and 3A5 also contributed to a lesser extent. Similarly the metabolites AZ5104 
and AZ7550 were extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 and/or CYP3A5. The extent of formation of AZ5104 and 
AZ7550 from osimertinib incubations also indicated that they were predominantly formed by CYPs 3A4 and 3A5.

Excretion 
Following intravenous and oral administration of osimertinib, the major route of excretion was via faeces, with 
urinary elimination being a minor component. Excretion was rapid in rats (study KMR008), with the majority of 
dose recovered in the first 48h, and between 90.0 and 99.3% recovered within 168 h. In dogs (study 197725), 
excretion rate was variable between individuals, with the majority (85.2 to 86.4%) recovered within 168h. The 
constitution of the excreted radioactivity has not been further studied in animals. In humans, approximately 
47.7% of osimertinib related components were excreted after 7 days, 68.9% after 21 days and 81.9% after 84 
days with the majority of radioactivity excreted in faeces. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions  
Cytochrome P450 Inhibition 
The direct and time-dependent CYP inhibitory potential of osimertinib, AZD5104 and AZD7550 (0.1-30 µM) were 
tested against a panel of CYP enzyme activities in vitro. Osimertinib showed to be an in vitro competitive 
inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 with an IC50 of 5.1 μM, but not CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 2E1 at 
clinically relevant concentrations.  
An in vivo study has been submitted to elucidate the CYP inhibition of osimertinib at the clinical doses. Modest 
inhibition was showed for CYPs 1A2 and 2C8. However, at clinical doses osimertinib did not result in DDI via 
inhibition of CYP1A2 or 2C8. At the highest osimertinib concentration (30 μM) no inhibition of CYP2A6, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 was observed. The metabolites AZ5104 and AZ7550 demonstrated 
modest inhibition against CYPs 1A2, 2C8, 3A4/5 with IC50 of >17.9 μM. Osimertinib was shown to be a weak 
time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4 in vitro (24% TDI at 50 μM) which was further analyzed where the kinetic 
time-dependent inhibition parameters kinact (maximal inactivation) and ki (concentration at 50% Kinact) for 
osimertinib against CYP3A4 were determined. The estimated values were 0.0617 min-1 and 1090 μM, 
respectively. 
Cytochrome P450 Induction 
The CYP induction potential of osimertinib was investigated using cultures of human hepatocytes. At the highest 
osimertinib concentration (3.3 μM), induction of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 activity was observed (up to 45% and 16% 
of positive control respectively) with no induction of CYP2B6.  
UGT inhibition 
Based on in vitro studies, osimertinib is not an inhibitor of UGT2B7 and weak inhibitor of UGT1A1 and is unlikely 
to result in a clinically relevant hepatic DDI. However, due to higher concentrations observed in the intestine, 
intestinal inhibition of UGT1A1 is possible but the clinical impact is unknown. 
Transporter inhibition 
The table below outlines results of studies that investigated the inhibition of efflux and uptake transporters by 
osimertinib. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/15445/2016 
Page 28/134 
  
  
 
Table 13: Inhibition of efflux and uptake transporters by osimertinib 
Transporter substrate  
In vitro, osimertinib, AZ5104 and AZ7550 are substrates for the human drug efflux transporter MDR1 (P-gp) and 
BCRP. Osimertinib, AZ5104 and AZ7550 are not substrates for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 (data not shown). 
Protein binding 
The human microsomal binding of osimertinib was observed to be 97.4% in a 4 hours incubation (fumics 
=0.0261, n=1). As this value indicated a high non-specific binding to human microsomes, the DDI assessment 
has been re-evaluated for CYPs 3A4, 2C8 and for other where the IC50 is >30 µM. Three situations were 
presented using a mechanistic static model: A) fumic = 1 and plasma protein binding (PPB) = 90%, B) fumic = 
0.0261 and PPB = 90% and C) fumic = 0.0261 and PPB = 99%. In all situations the possibility of interaction with 
CYP3A4/5 was greater than with other CYPs. 
Other pharmacokinetic studies 
Metabolite pharmacokinetics 
Two different N-desmethyl active metabolites of osimertinib (AZ5104 and AZ7550) were identified during 
incubations with rat or dog hepatocytes, and both were found to be pharmacologically active. The 
concentrations of metabolites AZ7550 and AZ5104 have been determined in mouse, rat and dog 
pharmacokinetic studies and 1 and 3 month rat and dog pivotal toxicology, safety pharmacology and rat 
embryofetal development studies following oral dosing of osimertinib.  
Exposure to osimertinib and AZ7550 was quantified in all of these studies, but it was only possible to quantify 
exposure to AZ5104 in the 1 month dog study and dog cardiovascular study due to analytical issues (interfering 
component, failed ISR). Exposure to these metabolites achieved in rats and dogs at the highest doses tested in 
the pivotal repeat dose toxicity studies and in the rat embryofoetal development study were generally similar to 
or below that observed in humans at the 80 mg dose. 
In rats (study 3416AR) both osimertinib and AZ7550 exposure on Day 28 increased approximately in proportion 
to increasing dose. AZ7550 maximal concentrations and AUC (0-24) were 5 to 13% and 6 to 14% of osimertinib

values. The exposure of osimertinib and AZ7550 on Day 91 of the rat 3 month toxicology study (study 526248) 
were similar to those from Day 28 of the 1 month toxicology studies.  
In dogs (study 1351AD), osimertinib, AZ7550 and AZ5104 exposure on Day 28 increased approximately in 
proportion to increasing dose. AZ7550 maximal concentrations and AUC (0-24) ranged from 15 to 19% and 16 
to 20% of osimertinib respectively.  AZ5104 maximal concentrations and AUC (0-24) ranged from 4 to 5% and 
5 to 8% of osimertinib, respectively. Exposure to osimertinib was consistently greater in females than males 
only in rats and there were no sex differences in exposure to AZD9191 and AZ7550 in dogs. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Toxicology studies submitted included repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs (up to 3 months duration), 
in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity, reproductive toxicity and phototoxic potential. Additional in vitro genetic 
toxicity studies were conducted on a number of potential impurities. All pivotal studies were conducted in 
compliance with GLP regulations and used the intended clinical route of administration (oral). 
Single dose toxicity 
Dedicated single dose toxicity studies were not submitted.

Carcinogenicity 
As this application is for the use of osimertinib for the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC no

Reproduction Toxicity 
Osimertinib has been evaluated in a modified rat embryo-foetal development study that included an assessment 
of pre-implantation pregnancy and a littering phase. Studies on male and female fertility, embryo-foetal 
development in rabbits and a pre-and postnatal development study in rats were not submitted.  
Fertility and early embryonic development 
In repeat dose toxicity studies, an increased incidence of anoestrus, corpora lutea degeneration in the ovaries 
and epithelial thinning in the uterus and vagina were seen in rats exposed to osimertinib for ≥ 1 month at 
clinically relevant plasma concentrations. Findings in the ovaries seen following 1 month dosing were reversible. 
In rats and dogs, testicular findings comprising seminiferous tubular degeneration and/or spermatic retention 
accompanied by secondary epididymal changes (reduced sperm) and decreases in organ weights (prostate and 
epididymides in rats) have been seen in the 1 and 3 month studies (≥10 mg/kg/day in rats, ≥2 mg/kg/day in 1 
month dog study and at 6/10 mg/kg/day in 3 month dog study). In the 1 month rat study these findings were 
not present following 1 month off-dose, indicating reversibility. In the 1 month dog study testicular pathology 
was present at the low and mid doses, but not at the high dose at the end of the dosing period.  
Embryofoetal development 
Effects on embryofoetal development and early postnatal survival/growth were assessed in a modified rat 
embryofoetal development study, which included a littering phase. Maternal toxicity was seen at doses of ≥ 20 
mg/kg/day. Administration to rats prior to implantation until Day 20 of gestation resulted in an increase in 
post-implantation loss at 20 mg/kg/day. Dosing during the major period of embryonic organogenesis (Day 6 to 
16 of gestation) was associated with reduced foetal weights at 20 and 30 mg/kg/day. Administration to dams 
during gestation and through early lactation (Day 6 of gestation until at least Day 6 of lactation) caused reduced 
pup survival (100% litter loss seen at 30 mg/kg/day) and reduced pup weights at ≥ 20 mg/kg/day. There were 
no compound-related external or visceral abnormalities in foetuses or pups (doses up to 30 mg/kg/day).

Exposure to osimertinib and AZ7550 was confirmed in suckling pups, which may indicate the potential for 
excretion of osimertinib and its metabolites in milk. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Plasma levels of osimertinib and metabolites AZ5105 and AZ7550 were evaluated in the pivotal repeat-dose 
toxicity studies. 
Comparison of total osimertinib and AZ7550 exposures in rats, dogs and humans showed that the steady state 
Cmax and AUC levels in humans at the proposed therapeutic dose of 80 mg was generally similar to or higher 
than that achieved at the high dose levels in the 3 month rat (5880 and 16200 nM.hr in males and females, 
respectively) and dog studies (5420 nM.hr), indicating lack of margins of safety. Due to failing incurrent sample 
reproducibility (ISR), TK parameters for metabolite AZ5104 are not available from the pivotal 3 month studies 
in rats and dogs, and margins of safety can therefore not be established for AZ5104.  
Local Tolerance  
No local tolerance studies were submitted as the drug will be administered orally. 
Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
Antigenicity studies were not submitted because there were was no evidence of immunological effects of 
osimertinib in the repeat dose toxicity studies. 
Immunotoxicity 
In accordance with ICH S8 and ICH S9, no dedicated immunotoxicity studies were submitted. 
No relevant liver or immune-related signals have been identified in repeat dose toxicology studies up to 3 
months duration. Increases in white blood cell counts and fibrinogen and decreases in red blood cell parameters 
were seen in rats and dogs. These findings were accompanied by increased haematopoiesis in the spleen in the 
3-month rat study. They were considered to be secondary to the wild type EGFR-related degenerative and 
inflammatory changes seen in the skin and GI tract. These effects were reversible in the 1-month rat study (not 
seen in dogs at 1 month). The finding in the mesenteric lymph node (minimal to mild sinus erythrocytes and 
erythrophagocytosis) seen in rats at 1 and 3 months, which reversed following 1 month off-dose, was not 
associated with any other degenerative changes or pigment derived from red blood cell breakdown and is 
considered to be of limited toxicological significance. 
Hypocellularity seen in the thymus and bone marrow were confined to non-tolerated or poorly tolerated doses 
(≥40 mg/kg) in the 7 and 14 day rat studies.  
Limited assessments of other potential markers of immune activation (α-macroglobulin in the rat 7 day study 
and lymphocyte subsets in the dog 14 day study) were included in the dose range finding studies and there were 
no noteworthy changes. Marked decreases in platelets accompanied by macrothrombocytes on peripheral blood 
smears were seen in the 14 day dog study, but only at non tolerated doses (≥40 mg/kg); there were no 
histopathological correlates.  
Dependence 
Dependence studies were not submitted.

In addition to monitoring systemic exposure to AZ5104 and AZ7550 in the pivotal toxicology studies, an 
investigative study was conducted to evaluate the toxicology of AZ5104 following oral administration to female 
rats for 1 month. The in-life, clinical pathology and histopathological findings seen in AZ5104-treated rats were 
consistent with those observed with osimertinib in the rat with exception of the inflammatory changes in the skin 
(minimal to slight inflammatory cell infiltration) and adrenal gland (minimal cortical inflammatory cell 
infiltration) which showed partial recovery. 
Impurities 
Four potentially mutagenic impurities (based on structural alerts from commercial databases, DEREK and 
Leadscope, and/or an in-house database) were evaluated for bacterial mutagenicity in vitro using the Ames 
assay. Two impurities were negative in Ames assays, and are considered as non-mutagenic whilst the other two 
tested positive and are considered mutagenic. 
Other studies 
Osimertinib showed no evidence of phototoxic potential in an in vitro cytotoxicity assay conducted in the 
presence and absence of UV light.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
In in vitro cellular EGFR phosphorylation assays, osimertinib showed potent inhibition of all single-activated 
(EGFRm) and double-T790M mutant (EGFRm/T790M) assays across different cell lines. Osimertinib has greater 
activity towards mutant EGFRs compared to wild-type in an in vitro cellular context. Furthermore, in vitro 
wash-out and time-dependent cellular kinetic studies supported the irreversible mechanism of action of 
osimertinib. 
Two pharmacologically active metabolites, AZ5104 and AZ7550 have been identified. AZ5104 exhibited 
significantly greater potency than osimertinib across mutant and wild-type EGFR assays, and thus displayed a 
smaller margin of selectivity against wild-type EGFR compared to EGFRm/T790M and EGFRm in vitro.  
Osimertinib and AZ7550 both showed low activity against IGF1R and InsR. In comparison, AZ5104 showed 
greater activity against IGF1R and InsR. Osimertinib and both metabolites were largely inactive against cellular 
pIGF1R with IC50s >1 μM, indicating that these agents do not potently inhibit IGF1R in cell context in vitro, and 
observed enzyme potency of AZ5104 did not appear to translate into significant cell activity.

Non-clinical data indicate that osimertinib and AZ5104 inhibit the hERG-channel, and QT-prolonging effect 
cannot be excluded. QTc interval prolongation has been observed in patients treated with osimertinib (see 
section 2.4.3). 
Osimertinib inhibited GI transit in the rat at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. The mechanism 
underlying this finding in uncertain, but reductions in gastric emptying have been reported with other EGFR 
inhibitors in rats. The GI tract was identified as a target organ in the repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs 
where there were histopathological findings (atrophic, degenerative and/or inflammatory changes associated 
with reductions in food consumption and body weight loss) that are considered to be a consequence of inhibition 
of the wild-type EGFR (see discussion on toxicology). 
Pharmacokinetics 
Exposure increased approximately in proportion to increasing dose. Absorption was prolonged with Tmax 
typically being achieved at 2-4h or later following higher doses in toxicology studies. 
The plasma protein binding has not been determined due to instability of osimertinib in human plasma and 
non-specific binding. Based on computational algorithm, the prediction for AZ5104 was the same as measured 
(98% bound) suggesting that the binding of osimertinib (99% predicted) and AZ7550 (98% predicted) were 
likely to be at least as high as for AZ5104. For the purpose of DDI potential, a conservative value of 90% bound 
(10%) free has been used. 
No metabolism studies in animals were provided. In general, non-clinical studies of in vivo metabolism should 
have been submitted. However, since no human metabolite comprises >8% of total osimertinib related 
material, and in view of the intended patient population, further characterization of metabolites and metabolite 
toxicity is not warranted. 
Osimertinib was a substrate of P-gp and BCRP but is unlikely to result in clinically relevant drug interactions with 
active substances by osimertinib at the clinical doses. Osimertinib is not a substrate for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3.  
Based on in vitro data, osimertinib is predicted to inhibit BCRP at clinically relevant concentrations. Therefore, 
osimertinib have the potential to increase plasma concentrations of co-administered medicinal products 
transported by this protein. 
In in vitro studies osimertinib inhibited weakly transport via OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1, MATE2K, and OCT2. 
Based on current scientific recommendation (ITC 2010), the inhibition of OATP1B1 would be unlikely to result in 
a clinically significant DDI. For OATP1B3, MATE2-K, OAT1, OAT3 a clinically meaningful DDI could be excluded 
but not with MATE1 and OCT2 substrates. However, as osimertinib has showed high covalent binding and the 
impact of the incubational binding fuinc was not take into account in these in vitro study for drug transporters 
inhibition, the potential for transporter inhibition will be further addressed post authorisation (see RMP).  
The osimertinib potential to inhibit the P-gp transporter cannot be predicted since the highest concentration 
studied (30 µM) is lower than the maximum expected concentrations in the intestine at clinical doses. The 
maximum expected concentrations in the intestine (64 µM) cannot be tested since it was cytotoxic. Based on 
solubility data and dissolution profiles provided, the gut concentrations did not seem to be highly limited by the 
solubility of the compound or by slow dissolution. Therefore, an in vivo clinical study on the potential of 
osimertinib for P-gp inhibition will be conducted and submitted by Q4 2017 (see RMP).Reversible inhibition of 
osimertinib was demonstrated in vitro for CYP2C8 and CYP3A4/5 and time-dependent inhibition for CYP3A4/5, 
while induction of mRNA was found for CYP1A2 and CYP3A4.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/15445/2016 
Page 37/134 
  
  
 
Osimertinib is not an inhibitor of UGT2B7 in vitro and is weak inhibitor of UGT1A1. It is therefore unlikely to 
result in a clinically relevant hepatic DDI. However, due to higher concentrations observed in the intestine, 
intestinal inhibition of UGT1A1 is possible but the clinical impact is unknown (see section 5.2 of the SmPC).  
AZ5105 in vitro inhibited reversibly CYP1A2, CYP3A4/5, and CYP2C8, and time dependent CYP3A4/5, while 
induction of mRNA was found for CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. AZ7550 inhibited CYP3A4/5, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and 
CYP2D6. Both AZ5105 and AZ7550 induced CYP3A5 and CYP1A2 mRNA, were substrates of P-gp and BCRP, but 
were not substrates for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. AZ5104 and AZ7550 have not been included in the evaluation 
of interaction potential as the clinical plasma exposure of both metabolites is less than 25% of osimertinib. 
Toxicology 
The wild-type EGFR is widely expressed in tissues of epithelial, mesenchymal and neuronal origin where it plays 
an important role in many physiological processes including proliferation, regeneration, differentiation and 
development (Yano et al, 2003). While osimertinib is more potent towards mutant EGFR compared to wild-type 
EGFR, the active metabolite AZ5104 has significantly greater potency towards wild-type EGFR than osimertinib. 
Consequently, the repeat-dose toxicity findings are most likely related to inhibition of wild-type EGFR and are 
expected findings at higher doses of osimertinib, possibly related to AZ5104. This is further supported by similar 
findings with other EGFR inhibitors. 
The majority of the findings in the toxicology studies were seen below clinical exposures and it was not possible 
to calculate safety margins. 
The main findings observed in repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs comprised atrophic, inflammatory 
and/or degenerative changes affecting the epithelia of the cornea (accompanied by corneal translucencies and 
opacities in dogs at ophthalmology examination), GI tract (including tongue), skin, and male and female 
reproductive tracts with secondary changes in spleen. These findings occurred at plasma concentrations that 
were below those seen in patients at the 80 mg therapeutic dose. The findings present following 1 month of 
dosing were largely reversible within 1 month of cessation of dosing with the exception of partial recovery for 
some of the corneal changes. The dose-limiting findings were reduced food consumption accompanied by body 
weight loss, and ocular clinical signs and ophthalmology findings. Increases in white cell counts, decreases in red 
cell parameters and increased haematopoiesis in the spleen are considered to be secondary to the degenerative 
and inflammatory changes in these tissues. Similar findings have been seen with other EGFR TKIs and these are 
considered to be class effects. The increased haematopoiesis in the spleen would be expected to be reversible 
once the inflammatory/degenerative pathology had resolved. Other target organs were the male reproductive 
tract, male mammary gland, mesenteric lymph nodes, harderian gland, lung, bone marrow and thymus.  
An increased incidence of foamy alveolar macrophage aggregates was seen in the lung in the 3 month rat study 
(both sexes). Further characterisation of these macrophages by electron microscopy revealed changes 
consistent with early phospholipidosis in females and either lipofucinosis or multivesicular bodies in both sexes. 
Given the low severity of the findings and the lack of any associated degenerative or inflammatory changes in 
the lung alveoli or interstitial tissue, this small degree of phospholipid accumulation is considered likely to 
represent an adaptive response and is considered to be non-adverse. These changes would be expected to be 
reversible as no structural alterations were noted in the lungs and the changes were generally of minimal to mild 
severity (Chatman et al, 2009; Reasor et al 2006). Similar findings were not observed in the dog studies. Hence, 
the early phospholipidosis was considered unlikely to be of clinical relevance. 
Marked decreases in platelets accompanied by macrothrombocytes on peripheral blood smears were seen in the 
14 day dog study. Consequently, haematological parameters were monitored in patients with osimertinib.

However due to the lack of clinical consequences of the observed reductions, the identified risk was not 
categorised as important. 
Recovery was assessed in the 1 month rat and dog studies where all findings were reversible, although partial 
recovery was seen for some of the corneal changes (corneal epithelial atrophy in rats and corneal translucencies 
in dogs) within the 1 month off-dose period. Based on preclinical experience with gefitinib, it is uncertain 
whether the corneal opacities would reverse (corneal opacities seen in the 6 month dog study with gefitinib did 
not fully reverse following 12 weeks off-dose; Yano et al 2003). The corneal findings seen in osimertinib-treated 
animals are considered to be a consequence of inhibition of the wild-type EGFR leading to a reduction in the 
production and migration of epithelial cells to replace those lost by normal exfoliation. 
Degenerative changes were present in the testes in rats and dogs exposed to osimertinib for ≥1 month and 
there was a reduction in male fertility in rats following exposure to osimertinib for 3 months. These findings were 
seen at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. Pathology findings in the testes seen following 1 month dosing 
were reversible in rats; however, a definitive statement on reversibility of these lesions in dogs cannot be made.  
A female fertility study has not been conducted. In repeat dose toxicity studies, an increased incidence of 
anoestrus, corpora lutea degeneration in the ovaries and epithelial thinning in the uterus and vagina were seen 
in rats exposed to osimertinib for ≥1 month at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. Findings in the ovaries 
seen following 1 month dosing were reversible. 
Post-implantation loss in rats was observed at an exposure equivalent to the human exposure at the 
recommended dose of 80 mg daily. Dosing during the major period of embryonic organogenesis was associated 
with reduced foetal weights. Administration to dams during gestation and through early lactation caused 
reduced pup survival and reduced pup weights. There were no compound-related external or visceral 
abnormalities in foetuses or pups. Exposure to osimertinib and AZ7550 was confirmed in suckling pups, which 
may indicate the potential for excretion of osimertinib and its metabolites in milk (see section 5.3 of the SmPC).  
Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with osimertinib which is considered acceptable in accordance 
with ICHS9. Osimertinib did not cause genetic damage in in vitro and in vivo assays. 
Four impurities are considered adequately qualified based on the levels present in the batches used for the 
toxicity studies. The levels in the batches used for the genotoxicity studies are in principle too low to address 
potential genotoxicity of the four specified impurities.  However, due to lack of structural alerts in two QSAR 
assays (DEREK and Leadscope), and due to negative genotoxicity studies with the structurally related 
osimertinib, are considered devoid of mutagenic potential. In addition, based on the intended patient population 
with life time expectancy less than 5 years, the proposed limit of intake is considered acceptable for the 
mutagenic impurities from a non-clinical point of view. 
The lack of local tolerance and antigenicity studies were considered acceptable. 
ERA 
Osimertinib refined PECsurfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and is not a PBT substance as 
log Kow does not exceed 4.5. In addition, the risk of bioaccumulation is low. Osimertinib is therefore not 
expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
However, if the applicant applies for a wider use of osimertinib in the future, bringing the refined 
PECsurfacewater value above the action limit, a thorough assessment of the phase II studies has to be 
performed.

2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Based on the submitted preclinical studies, osimertinib showed potent inhibition of all single-activated (EGFRm) 
and double-T790M mutant (EGFRm/T790M) assays.  
The pharmacokinetic profile of osimertinib was well described. Protein binding has not been determined for 
osimertinib and AZ7550 but was predicted using computational models. The toxicity of osimertinib has been 
sufficiently well characterised, with adverse effects in study animals related to wild-type EGFR inhibition at 
higher doses. Most adverse effects seen were reversible.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of osimertinib have been characterized following single dosing in healthy volunteers 
(Study 5 – Comparative bioavailability and Food Effect; Study 10 – Effect of omeprazole [a proton pump 
inhibitor] on osimertinib exposure; Study 11 – Mass Balance) and after single and multiple dosing in patients 
with advanced NSCLC (Study 9 – Food effect; Study 12 – Effect of itraconazole [a CYP3A4 inhibitor]; Study 13 
– Effect of rifampicin [a CYP3A4 inducer]; Study 14 – Effect on simvastatin [a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate]; 
Study 19 – Effect on rosuvastatin [a sensitive BCRP substrate]; AURA – Dose escalation; AURA extension – 
Pivotal and AURA 2 – Pivotal). 
Different formulations 
The final formulation is an immediate-release film-coated tablet. During the course of the development program, 
4 different immediate release formulations were employed: capsule, oral solution, phase 1 tablet and 
film-coated tablet (see quality aspects).Film-coated tablets has been manufactured in two facilities.

Capsule, oral solution and Phase I tablet: In a relative bioavailability study (Study 5 conducted with the lowest 
dose of 20 mg), the capsule formulation showed similar bioavailability to the solution and the Phase 1 tablet 
formulation. In AURA Phase I study, a statistical comparison of steady-state exposures after dosing 80 mg 
osimertinib daily as the capsule or Phase 1 tablet formulation showed that the exposures were similar, although 
were not bioequivalent according the standard criteria.

Phase I tablet and Film-coated tablet: The film-coated tablet was qualitatively identical to the Phase 1 tablet with 
small differences in the amounts of excipients. Both formulations showed similar dissolution profiles with release 
of greater than 85% within 30 minutes in pH 1.3 and pH 6.8 media. 
Comparison of exposures from osimertinib clinical studies, in which either the capsule or Phase 1 tablet or 
film-coated tablets were dosed at 80 mg, indicated similar exposures across formulations. Of note, the 
variability of the tablet formulations appeared to be lower than that observed with the capsule formulation.

Film-coated tablet in two facilities: Equivalent release profiles were observed for tablets manufactured at both 
sites with both tablets showing release of greater than 85% within 15 minutes in pH 1.3 and pH 6.8 media and 
greater than 85% within 30 minutes in pH 4.5 medium (f2 value in pH 4.5 medium was 52.6). 
Dispersed tablet: For patients who are unable to swallow or where dosing via naso-gastric tube is required, 
tablets may also be administered as dispersion in water. The dissolution of osimertinib tablets dispersed in water 
was evaluated at pH 1.3 (QC media), 4.5 and 6.8 at both 40 and 80 mg. The release profiles for dispersed and 
intact tablets are similar, with comparable release being observed within 30 minutes, indicating that tablet 
pre-dispersion does not negatively affect extent of release. F2 values have not been provided.  
Absorption  
The absolute bioavailability of osimertinib in man has not been determined. Based on mass balance study (Study 
11), absorption of osimertinib appears to be high with fraction absorbed greater than 0.8 based on less than 
19% of the dose eliminated in faeces in the first 72 hours after dosing. 
Following oral administration of osimertinib, peak plasma concentrations of osimertinib were achieved with a 
median (min-max) tmax of 6 (3 - 24) hours, with several peaks observed over the first 24 hours in some 
patients.  
In healthy volunteers administered an 80 mg tablet where gastric pH was elevated by dosing of omeprazole for 
5 days (Study 10), osimertinib exposure was not affected (AUC and Cmax increase by 7% and 2%, respectively) 
with the 90% CI for exposure ratio contained within the 80-125% limit.

In the Food effect study (Study 5) conducted with 20 mg using Phase I tablet, administration of the tablet with 
a high-fat meal increased osimertinib AUC and Cmax approximately 19% and 14%, respectively, compared to 
fasted conditions (see also elimination).

Fed conditions had no effect on the AUC and Cmax of the metabolites AZ5104 and the AUC of AZ7550 compared 
to fasted conditions. The Cmax of AZ7550 decreased by approximately 16% under fed conditions compared to 
fasted conditions. Based on a clinical pharmacokinetic study in patients at 80 mg (Study 9), food does not alter 
osimertinib bioavailability to a clinically meaningful extent (AUC increase by 6% (90%CI -5, 19) and Cmax 
decrease by 7% (90%CI -19, 6)). Food effect did not impact osimertinib median tmax (8 hours in fed vs 6 hours 
in fasted) or t1/2 (54 hours in fed vs 56 hours in fasted) (see sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC). 
Distribution 
Osimertinib appeared to be extensively distributed in healthy volunteers with mean (± SD) apparent volume of 
distribution (Vz/F) of 2495 (± 936) L after administration of 80 mg of the proposed commercial film-coated 
tablet in Study D5160C00010. In AURA Phase I, the mean (± SD) apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) was 
1216 (± 604) L in patients after the Phase 1 tablet dose at 80 mg. The volume of distribution was extensive in 
both populations and was approximately 2-fold greater in healthy volunteers than in patients. In a population 
pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation report for osimertinib typical value for apparent volume of 
distribution was 986 L. At steady-state, circulating plasma concentrations are typically maintained within a 1.6 
fold range over the 24-hour dosing interval. 
In vitro studies indicate that osimertinib is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4, and CYP3A5. CYP3A4 
mediated metabolism may be a minor pathway. Alternative metabolic pathways may exist which have not been 
fully characterized Based on in vitro studies, 2 pharmacologically active metabolites (AZ7550 and AZ5104) have 
subsequently been identified in the plasma of preclinical species and in humans after oral dosing with 
osimertinib; AZ7550 showed a similar pharmacological profile to TAGRISSO while AZ5104 showed greater 
potency across both mutant and wild-type EGFR. Both metabolites appeared slowly in plasma after 
administration of TAGRISSO to patients, with a median (min-max) t max of 24 (4-72) and 24 (6-72) hours, 
respectively. In human plasma, parent osimertinib accounted for 0.8%, with the 2 metabolites contributing 
0.08% and 0.07% of the total radioactivity with the majority of the radioactivity being covalently bound to 
plasma proteins. The geometric mean exposure of both AZ5104 and AZ7550, based on AUC, was approximately 
10% each of the exposure of osimertinib at steady-state (see sections 4.5 and 5.2 of the SmPC and also 
non-clinical section).   
In the [14C]-osimertinib human study (study D5160C00011), the whole blood to plasma ratio of total 
radioactivity was 0.917 in humans suggesting osimertinib and its metabolites distributed equally in whole blood 
and plasma.

Available in vitro non-clinical data suggest that osimertinib binds covalently to plasma proteins, serum albumin 
and hepatocytes. 
The ability of osimertinib to enter the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was shown by the measurement of CSF 
concentration in one patient (in study AURA2). In that patient, the concentration of osimertinib measured in CSF 
was approximately 1% of the total osimertinib concentration in plasma 
Elimination 
Mean apparent clearance was low to moderate, after single dose in healthy male volunteers 27-30 L/h and in 
NSCLC patients 16.9 L/h. Osimertinib steady state clearance was 16.9 L/h after dosing with 80 mg osimertinib 
in NSCLC patients. In a population pharmacokinetic modelling & simulation report for osimertinib the typical 
value of clearance was 14.2 L/h. 
According to Study D5160C00011 (in healthy volunteers), renal clearance (ClR) of osimertinib was low with 
mean Cl R of 0.235 (± 0.116) L/h and 1.37 L/h and 1.77 L/h for AZ5104 y AZ7550, respectively. 
Mean half-life of osimertinib after single dose tablet formulation was 53-64 hours in healthy male volunteers and 
48 hours in NSCLC patients. In Study D5160C00011 (in healthy volunteers), the t 1/2 of osimertinib was 
calculated to 61 hours whereas the [14C]-osimertinib equivalent in plasma was 472 hours in plasma and 556 
hours in blood. It was only possible to extract approximately 8% and 65% of the radioactive material out of 
plasma and faeces respectively, likely due to irreversible binding of the osimertinib related material to plasma 
proteins. 
The primary elimination pathway for osimertinib and metabolites was faecal. 
Table 19: Descriptive statistics for total radioactivity recovered (%dose) cumulatively by collection 
interval (both urine and faeces together) – Study 11 
Although total recovery of radioactivity was less than 90%, radioactivity was still being excreted at the end of 
the study (84 days). At least 12 components were observed in the pooled urine and faecal samples in humans 
with 5 components accounting for >1% of the dose of which unchanged osimertinib, AZ5104 and AZ7550, 
accounted for approximately 1.9, 6.6 and 2.7% of the dose while a cysteinyl adduct (M21) and an unknown 
metabolite (M25) accounted for 1.5% and 1.9% of the dose, respectively. Unchanged osimertinib accounted for 
approximately 2% of the elimination with 0.8% in urine and 1.2% in faeces (see section 5.2 of the SmPC).

dose level 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Osimertinib showed dose proportional increases in exposure (AUC and Cmax) both with increasing single and 
multiple doses. The PK for the 160 and 240 mg cohorts were time independent with a median temporal change 
parameter/linearity factor of 0.972 after dosing with osimertinib (capsule) and 0.901 after dosing with 80 mg 
osimertinib (Phase 1 tablet) after 22 days of dosing (with a value of 1 indicating that PK do not change with 
time).  
Based on the mean osimertinib half-life of approximately 48 hours, steady-state is expected to be achieved after 
10 to 11 days of once-daily dosing. Visual observation of trough levels of osimertinib, AZ5104 and AZ7550 
indicates that steady-state is achieved by Day 15 for osimertinib and AZ5104 in AURA extension and by Day 22 
for all of them in AURA2. As expected from the long half-life, accumulation of approximately 3 fold was observed 
after multiple once daily dosing of either the capsule or the Phase 1 tablet for 22 days.  
Osimertinib induces and inhibits CYP3A4 in vitro, and osimertinib is meanly metabolized by this enzyme. 
However, the absence of auto-induction and auto-inhibition of osimertinib is supported by not only multiple PK 
parameters (temporal change parameter, predictable accumulation based on half-life, similar metabolite to 
parent exposure ratios, etc.) but also by the dose proportional PK observed after single dose (lack of 
auto-inhibition) and time independent PK after multiple dose (lack of auto-induction). Additionally, the analysis 
of 4β-hydroxycholesterol in study 14 and 19 indicated limited increase in the presence of multiple doses of 
osimertinib. Therefore, it is unlikely that significant auto induction of osimertinib is occurring.

Intra- and inter-individual variability 
The overall inter-individual variability is considered moderate to high (%CV approximately 40-80%), being 
slightly lower in healthy volunteers (%CV approximately 30-50%). Inter-individual variability seems to be lower 
with film-coated tablets (40-50%) than with capsules. Intra-individual variability has not been studied. 
Pharmacokinetic in target population 
Exposure (AUC and Cmax) was higher in NSCLC patients compared to healthy volunteers as a result of slower 
clearance and smaller volume of distribution. As consequence, the half-life was comparable between patients 
and healthy volunteers. Inter-individual variability seems to be slightly lower in healthy volunteer than in 
patients. Additionally, in the population PK analysis, a difference in clearance was observed between healthy 
subjects and patients with NSCLC, with healthy subjects having a higher clearance.  
Mean PK parameters were obtained from patients. There were 3 single dose studies conducted in healthy 
volunteers to evaluate the relative bioavailability of different oral formulations (n=16) and preliminary food 
effect (Study 5; n=16), to evaluate the effect of gastric pH (Study 10; n=68) and to evaluate the rates and 
routes of absorption, metabolism and elimination ofosimertinib (Study 11; n=8). A definitive food effect study 
(Study 9; n=38) was conducted using the proposed commercial formulation (80 mg film-coated tablet 
formulation) in NSCLC patients. It was not considered appropriate to conduct the 14C human ADME study in 
patients due to the slow elimination and need to characterize the excretion of osimertinib related material for 
approximately 85 days following a single oral dose. However, in the study about the co-administration with 
omeprazole differences detected in human were no relevant (increased osimertinib AUC by approximately 7% 
and Cmax by 2%). No higher differences than in healthy subjects are expected since the effect of gastric pH is 
mainly based on the drug properties. 
Population PK model 
A population PK model for osimertinib and AZ5104 was developed based on plasma concentrations of 
osimertinib and AZ5104 from Phase I/II studies in NSCLC patients (AURA extension and AURA2) and one study 
in healthy subjects (D5160C00005). The final population PK parent and metabolite model was comprised of first 
order oral absorption of osimertinib followed by two compartments in series: one-compartment for osimertinib 
followed by a compartment for AZ5104. 
The impact of the following covariates on PK was evaluated: ethnicity, body weight (and/or body surface area, 
body mass index), formulation, sex, age, hepatic markers (albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) and bilirubin), creatinine clearance, and smoking status.

Table 21: Parameter estimates for the final osimertinib/AZ5104 PPK model 
The primary predictors of variability in osimertinib and AZ5104 PK were disease state (i.e. NSCLC patient vs. 
healthy subjects), body weight and serum albumin. In addition there was an ethnicity effect observed for 
AZ5104 but not osimertinib. There were no factors identified that would require dose adjustment in patients. 
The expected values of osimertinib AUCss, Css,max and Css,min for an 80-mg osimertinib dose in NSCLC patients 
are 11258 nM.h, 501 nM, and 417 nM, respectively. The expected values of AZ5104 AUCss, Css,max, and Css,min for 
an 80-mg osimertinib dose in NSCLC patients are 1271 nM.h, 56 nM, and 52 nM, respectively. 
Population PK estimated steady state AUC and Cmax were similar to that observed across patient studies.

Impairment renal function 
A formal clinical study to investigate the impact of renal impairment on osimertinib PK was not conducted. In 
Study D5160C00011 (14C-ADME) osimertinib, AZ5104 and AZ7550 were shown to undergo negligible renal 
clearance. However, as renal impairment can adversely affect some pathways of hepatic / gut metabolism, the 
impact of renal impairment was assessed in the population PK analysis. Based on a population pharmacokinetic 
analysis of 330 patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr 60 to less than 90 mL/min), 149 patients with 
moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to <than 60 mL/min), 3 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 to 
<than 30 mL/min) and 295 patients with normal renal function (≥90 mL/min), osimertinib exposures were 
similar. Patients with CLcr less than 15 mL/min were not included in the clinical trials.  
Impairment hepatic function 
In Study D5160C00011, osimertinib was shown to undergo significant metabolism mediated clearance 
presumably with the liver as a major site of biotransformation and hence, hepatic impairment might be expected 
to lead to increased exposure of osimertinib. 
Based on population PK analysis, there was no relationship between markers of hepatic function (ALT, AST, 
bilirubin) and osimertinib exposure. The hepatic impairment marker serum albumin showed an effect on the PK 
of osimertinib. Based on the PK analysis (via NCA analysis) of patients from AURA2 and AURA extension, mild 
hepatic impairment had no impact on the apparent clearance of osimertinib.  
Weight 
After dosing with osimertinib at 80 mg daily, AZ5104 circulated at a mean of 10.44% and 9.78% of the 
osimertinib AUCss and Css,max, respectively, and AZ7550 circulated at 9.80% and 9.01% of osimertinib AUCss 
and Css,max, respectively. Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, body weight have an impact on 
apparent clearance and volume of distribution, indicating that within a body weight range of 43–90 kg, the 
AUCss for osimertinib may range from -20% to +30% compared to the median body weight of 62 kg, while for 
AZ5104 AUCss may range similarly from -40 to +50%. Across the 43-90 kg body weight range, AZ5104 and 
AZ7550 each circulated in plasma at a geometric mean AUCss (and Css,max) of approximately 10% of 
osimertinib AUCss (and Css,max). Taking the extremes of body weight into consideration, from <43 kg to >90 
kg, AZ5104 metabolite ratios decreased from 11.8% to 9.6% while for AZ7550 it decreased from 12.8% to 
9.9%, respectively. This decrease in exposure of both metabolites relative to osimertinib with increasing body 
weight is unlikely to be of clinical significance. The population PK analysis included 35 patients with baseline 
body weight >90 kg, with a maximum body weight of 122 kg. The mean AUCss in patients > 90 kg (11244.8 
nM.h) was 17% lower than the mean AUCss in patients ≤90 kg (13547.7 nM.h).  
Race 
The population PK analysis included White (24%), non-Japanese or non-Chinese Asians (24%), Chinese (15%), 
Japanese (19%) and others (6%). There were some subjects who had missing ethnicity information (11.2%). 
The population PK analysis indicated there was no impact of race or ethnicity on osimertinib PK. 
A small decrease in AZ5104 AUCss of approximately 10–23% may be expected in Chinese, Japanese, Asian 
other and non-Asian-non-white patients compared to white patients. 
Smoking or use of other nicotine products 
The population PK analysis did not identify smoking status (current smokers = 3%, former smokers = 30%, 
never smokers = 67%) as having a significant impact on osimertinib PK.

Effects of other medicinal product on the pharmacokinetics of osimertinib 
Considering the results of in vitro studies, it has been shown that the Phase I metabolism of osimertinib is 
predominantly via CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. 
Strong CYP3A Inducer 
Strong CYP3A4 inducers can decrease the exposure of osimertinib (see section 4.5 of the SmPC). In a clinical PK 
study in patients (Study 13), the steady-state AUC of AZD92941 was reduced by 78% (90% CI 81, 76) and of 
AZ5104 was reduced by 82% (90% CI 83, 79) when co-administered with rifampicin (600 mg daily for 21 days). 
The Cmax of AZ5104 was also reduced by 78%. 
Strong CYP3A Inhibitor 
In a clinical PK study in patients (Study 12), osimertinib co-administered with 200 mg itraconazole twice daily (a 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) had no clinically significant effect on the exposure of osimertinib [(AUC) increased by 
24% (90% CI 15, 35) and Cmax decreased by 20% (90% CI -27, -13)]. AZ5104 increased in AUC approximately 
8% and decreased in Cmax approximately 24% and compared with the administration of osimertinib alone. 
Therefore, CYP3A4 inhibitors are not likely to affect the exposure of osimertinib.  
In study 12 and 13, the results of metabolite AZ7550 are not in line with it were expected. Its behaviour is 
different from behaviour of metabolite AZ5104 and parent. The reason for this behaviour could be based on its 
long half-life or as consequence of the impact of the inductor or the inhibitor in the parent’s metabolism. 
Nevertheless, considering that AZ7550 amounted to less than 8-10% of the exposure to osimertinib based on 
mean metabolite to parent ratios for AUC and Cmax, the fact that mean responsible for safety concerns is 
metabolite AZ5104 and the relevance of the observed modification in AUC and Cmax is low, this issue is not 
further persecuted.  
P-glycoprotein and BCRP 
Osimertinib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein and BCRP. 
Gastric pH modifying agents 
Based on the results of the clinical study with omeprazole, co-administration of omeprazole did not result in 
clinically relevant changes in osimertinib exposures.

Effects of osimertinib on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal product 
BCRP Substrate 
Osimertinib is a competitive inhibitor of BCRP. In a clinical PK studying patients (Study 19), co-administration of 
osimertinib with rosuvastatin (sensitive BCRP substrate) increased the AUC and Cmax of rosuvastatin by 35% 
(90% CI 15, 57) and 72% (90% CI 46, 103), respectively.  
CYP3A Substrate 
Osimertinib is a reversible and time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 and inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2. 
However, induction of CYP1A2 could be considered negative (due to sensitivity of the assay) since the increase 
in mRNA was less than 20% (16%) of the response of the positive control. 
In a clinical PK study in patients (Study 14), co-administration of osimertinib with simvastatin (sensitive CYP3A4 
substrate) decreased the AUC and Cmax of simvastatin by 9% (90% CI -23, 8%) and 23% (90% CI -37, 6%) 
respectively. These changes are small and not likely to be of clinical significance. In this study osimertinib was 
dosed for 28 days. It should be noted that a new steady state level of CYP3A4 could be reached by 8-10 days and 
the steady-stated was achieved by Day 15 for osimertinib and AZ5104 in AURA extension and by Day 22 in 
AURA2. Although the duration of the study is slightly limited is acceptable to investigate whether an 
investigational drug is an inducer or a time-dependent inhibitor in vivo. 
PBPK models 
The impact of several interactions has been predicted using PBPK models using Simcyp (version 14). Simcyp 
model was created using a combination of in silico, in vitro and in vivo data. The final Simcyp model was checked 
with a clinical dataset to show that the model is predictive of the PK and the variability of osimertinib at the 80 
mg dose. Using this final model, DDI simulations using oncology patient population administered with either 
itraconazole or ketoconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor), or rifampicin (strong CYP3A inducer) was performed. 
Similarly, simulation of osimertinib as a perpetrator of DDI was conducted with either simvastatin (CYP3A4 
substrate) or rosuvastatin (BCRP substrate) in the oncology patient population. 
The initial PBPK model submitted was refined to include CYP3A inhibition and induction parameters for predicting 
the net effect of probe CYP3A substrates and validated against clinical DDI data. 
The Simcyp PBPK model adequately predicted the plasma concentration-time profile for osimertinibosimertinib 
tablet monotherapy (AURA Phase I). The PK of osimertinib in a clinical DDI study with rifampicin, a strong 
inducer (Study 13) was used to verify the osimertinib DDI model. The Simcyp model was then used to predict 
the following interaction potential for the tablet formulation: 
1. The effect of moderate CYP3A inducer (efavirenz) and a weak inducer (dexamethasone) on exposure of 
osimertinib. Additional simulations were performed to potentially define osimertinib dose adjustment when 
given in combination with CYP3A inducers. 
2. The net effect of osimertinib on exposure to CYP3A probe substrate simvastatin. 
3. A preliminary evaluation of the potential effect of co-administration of osimertinib on the BCRP substrate 
rosuvastatin was simulated using Simcyp. Although rosuvastatin is a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and 
OCT2, based on static modelling, the potential effect of osimertinib on these transporters other than BCRP is 
unlikely. The model for rosuvastatin is not appropriately validated in Simcyp and hence, the simulations for this 
effect are preliminary and unvalidated and are shown for comparison only.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
See non-clinical aspects. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
No pharmacodynamics biomarkers were collected from the studies provided. 
Secondary pharmacology 
A proper QT-study according to the ICH 14 guideline was not performed. The QTc interval prolongation potential 
of osimertinib was assessed in AURA2. Serial ECGs were collected following a single dose and at steady-state to 
evaluate the effect of osimertinib on QTc intervals. A PK-PD modelling of exposure related to QTc-intervals 
indicated a linear relationship between plasma concentration of osimertinib and prolongation of the 
QTcF-interval with increasing concentrations of osimertinib. The predicted a drug-related QTc interval 
prolongation at 80 mg of 14 msec with an upper bound of 16 msec (90% CI). 
Relation between plasma concentration and effect 
No relationship has been observed between probability of response, DoR, or best percentage change in tumour 
size from baseline and osimertinib or AZ5104 exposure in EGFR T790M mutation positive patients with advanced 
NSCLC who have progressed on or after EGFR TKI therapy.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Four different immediate release formulations were employed: capsule, oral solution, phase 1 tablet and 
film-coated tablet.  Capsule and Phase 1 tablet formulation showed that the exposures were similar, although 
not bioequivalent according to the standard criteria. Considering the results on single-dose of study 5 and that 
osimertinib is a BCS class 3 compound, which has shown dose proportional PK between 20 mg and 80 mg and 
moderate-high inter-individual variability in NSCLC patients, this issue does not raise concern. In addition, 
pivotal studies (AURA Extension and AURA 2) are conducted with film-coated tablets. The modification of 
excipients between Phase 1 tablet and the film-coated tablet is not considered substantial. Similar exposures 
across different formulations used during the development program have been overall demonstrated.  
The osimertinib volume of distribution indicate extensive distribution into tissue. Plasma protein binding could 
not be measured due to instability, but based on the physicochemical properties of osimertinib plasma protein 
binding is likely to be high. Osimertinib has also been demonstrated to bind covalently to rat and human plasma 
proteins, human serum albumin and rat and human hepatocytes. 
Several issues in relation with covalent binding and the very limited identification of recovered radioactive 
material has been discussed since they produce uncertainties on exposure, identification of major elimination 
pathways, long term safety, bioanalytical assay, and results from in vitro experiments. At this time, there is no 
evidence of reversibility back to starting components once it is covalently bound, although it cannot be fully 
ruled out. The MAH will conduct a study investigating the potential for transporter inhibition taking into account 
the covalent binding and very limited identification of recovered radioactive material. In addition, more reliable 
estimation of plasmatic protein binding and binding to the transporters studies should be obtained from in vitro 
studies (see RMP).

According to non-clinical data, there were no toxicologically significant effects on the liver (e.g. plasma 
transaminases or histopathological changes) or effects indicative of immune-mediated toxicity. According to 
clinical safety data (median duration of treatment of 8.3 months with the longest being 24.9 months on 
treatment in AURA Phase I as of 01 May 2015 DCO), there are no long terms or late emerging effects from the 
covalent binding that could contribute to hepatic or immune mediated complications. With available data, no 
high impact on systemic exposure, bioanalytical method.  
Considering that osimertinib and metabolite AZ7550 were not detectable at 648 hours in the plasma, it is 
recommended to use 30 days as washout period. As a consequence, it is proposed to recommend women of 
child-bearing potential to use effective contraception for at least 2 months (30 days PK washout and 4 weeks for 
completion of one menstrual cycle) and 4 months in male (30 days PK washout and 90 days for completion of 
one spermatogenic cycle) (see section 4.6 of the SmPC). 
Relevant differences have been observed on PK parameters between NSCLC patients and healthy volunteers. It 
is not uncommon for oncology treatments to demonstrate different PK between healthy volunteers compared to 
cancer patients. The reasons for the differences in the PK are multi-factorial and covariates such as age, weight, 
metabolic capacity, renal function, plasma protein binding etc. may contribute to these differences (Cheeti et al 
2013). Differences in age, creatinine clearance and body weight have been detected between healthy subjects 
and patients included in PK studies. 
Population PK estimated steady state AUC and Cmax were similar to those observed across patient studies. The 
PPK analysis was in general performed using well recognized model building techniques. The validity of the final 
model seems to be overall acceptable.  
Regarding elimination of osimertinib, the DDI study with itraconazole suggests that CYP3A4 metabolism would 
not likely be a main pathway of osimertinib elimination. A clinical study (Study D5160C00020) to evaluate the 
absolute bioavailability of a single dose of osimertinib in healthy male subjects is planned and will be submitted 
by 30 June 2016 (see RMP). As bioavailability data will help understand the quantitative contribution of the 
different excretion routes/metabolism pathways, the MAH is requested to re-evaluate the elimination of 
osimertinib when these data is available and update the SmPC if needed. 
Clinical studies investigating the impact of renal impairment on osimertinib have not been submitted. Number of 
patients included with severe renal impairment is low (n=3). Since severe renal impairment may influence the 
elimination of hepatically eliminated drugs, a reduced-design study in patients with severe renal impairment will 
be conducted post authorisation and the results will be submitted by 31 December 2018 (see RMP).  No dose 
adjustment is recommended in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment. Limited data are available in 
patients with severe renal impairment. The safety and efficacy of this medicinal product has not been 
established in patients with end-stage renal disease [creatinine clearance (CLcr) <15 mL/min, calculated by the 
Cockcroft and Gault equation], or on dialysis. Caution should be exercised when treating patients with severe 
and end stage renal impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2 of the SmPC).. 
Considering that population with hepatic impairment included in the population PK analysis is limited and that 
serum albumin has been considered predictor of variability in osimertinib and AZ5104 PK, the effect of hepatic 
impairment on the PK of osimertinib cannot be ruled out in the population PK. Based on a pharmacokinetic 
analysis of 44 patients with mild hepatic impairment and 330 patients with normal hepatic function osimertinib 
exposures were similar. No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild hepatic impairment but 
caution should be used when administering osimertinib to these patients. The safety and efficacy of this 
medicinal product has not been established in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Until 
additional data become available, use in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment is not

EMA/CHMP/15445/2016 
Page 53/134 
  
  
 
recommended (see sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC).A clinical study investigating the impact of mild and 
moderate hepatic impairment (as assessed by Child-Pugh criteria) on osimertinib pharmacokinetics is currently 
ongoing and the results will be submitted by 30 November 2018 (see RMP). 
The decrease in AUCss of AZ5104 expected in Chinese, Japanese, Asian other and non-Asian-non-white patients 
compared to white patients is unlikely to have clinically relevant impact. No dose adjustment based on patient 
race or ethnicity is needed (see sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC). 
Number of current smokers (n=24; 3.1%) is low, limiting the possibility for a robust assessment of the PK in 
these patients. However, CYP1A2 (which is induced by smoking) is not a major enzyme involved in the metabolic 
clearance of osimertinib and it is therefore not expected a significant impact on osimertinib PK of smoking status 
(see section 5.2 of the SmPC). 
Population PK analysis suggests that body weight has a greater impact on pharmacokinetics of the metabolites 
AZ5104 and AZ7550 than on pharmacokinetics of osimertinib. The exposures of the metabolites AZ5104 and 
AZ7550, compared to the exposures of osimertinib, have been described in the different body weight situations. 
The absence of dose adjustment in patients over 90 Kg has also been justified (see sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the 
SmPC). 
Based on the results of a DDI study with rifampicin, it is recommended that concomitant use of strong CYP3A 
inducers (e.g. Phenytoin, rifampicin and carbamazepine) with osimertinib should be avoided. Moderate CYP3A4 
inducers (e g bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil) may also decrease osimertinib exposure and should be 
used with caution, or avoided when possible. There are no clinical data available to recommend a dose 
adjustment of osimertinib (see sections 4.5 of the SmPC). However use of St. John’s wort is contraindicated with 
osimertinib (see section 4.3 of the SmPC).  
In a clinical pharmacokinetic study, co-administration of omeprazole did not result in clinically relevant changes 
in osimertinib exposures. Gastric pH modifying agents can be concomitantly used with osimertinib without any 
restrictions (see section 4.5 of the SmPC). 
Based on clinical PK data, it is recommended that patients taking concomitant medications with disposition 
dependent upon BCRP and with narrow therapeutic index should be closely monitored for signs of changed 
tolerability of the concomitant medication as a result of increased exposure whilst receiving osimertinib (see 
sections 4.5 and 5.2 of the SmPC). 
In a clinical PK study with simvastatin (sensitive CYP3A4 substrate), the AUC and Cmax of simvastatin were 
decreased. The changes observed are small and not likely to be of clinical significance. Clinical PK interactions 
with CYP3A4 substrates are unlikely. Pregnane X Receptor (PXR) regulated enzyme interactions other than 
CYP3A4 have not been studied.  
However, it is not the optimal study to extrapolate the results due to the net effect of osimertinib over CYP3A4/5 
(reversible and time-dependent inhibition and induction). Simvastatin data is problematic to use to extrapolate 
the risk for enzyme induction of other PXR regulated enzymes but also to exclude the risk for inhibition of 
enzymes other than CYP3A4. Therefore, the applicant will conduct a new clinical study to assess the potential for 
DDI with a non-CYP3A4 mediated PXR substrate together with the potential for P-gp inhibition and submit the 
results by Q4 2017 (see RMP). 
The study should investigate not only the net effect of induction and inhibition, but also the PK of the victim on 
the first day of co-administration to address the potential risk for enzyme inhibition. In the evaluation of the 
results from this trial, extrapolation to other enzymes both regarding induction and inhibition needs to be

discussed. In the meantime, the lack of knowledge regarding both enzyme inhibitory and inducing properties 
has been reflected in the product information (see sections 4.5 and 5.2 of the SmPC). 
A risk for decreased exposure of hormonal contraceptives cannot be excluded. 
No biomarker data were provided. Therefore, PD analysis provided focused on clinical markers of efficacy and 
safety (see discussion on clinical efficacy and safety).  
Regarding the activity of osimertinib towards the T790M mutation in patients with advanced NSCLC, the ability 
of tumours to develop mechanisms against inhibitors of important signalling pathways may cause osimertinib 
resistance mutations to emerge. The Applicant is recommended to submit a proposal to investigate the 
mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib and identify potential treatment strategies. 
The PK-PD modelling data on QT/QTc-interval are limited and biased as most patients in thecame from the 80 
mg cohort. An influence on the QT/QTc-interval is also indicated by preclinical findings. The hERG-assay is e.g. 
blocked by relatively low concentrations of osimertinib (IC50 approx. 690 nM), and a study in dogs showed a 5-7 
% increase in QT-prolongation. In addition, in Guinea pigs, a decrease in heart frequency and a 7 % increase in 
the QT-interval was seen. Based on available data, a concentration-dependent increase in QTc interval 
prolongation can be predicted with osimertinib. 
If the patient is unable to swallow the tablet, the tablet may first be dispersed in 50 mL of non-carbonated water. 
It should be dropped in the water, without crushing, stirred until dispersed and immediately swallowed. An 
additional half a glass of water should be added to ensure that no residue remains and then immediately 
swallowed. No other liquids should be added. 
If administration via nasogastric tube is required, the same process as above should be followed but using 
volumes of 15 mL for the initial dispersion and 15 mL for the residue rinses. The resulting 30 mL of liquid should 
be administered as per the naso-gastric tube manufacturer’s instructions with appropriate water flushes. The 
dispersion and residues should be administered within 30 minutes of the addition of the tablets to water. It is not 
expected that differences in release rate observed between dispersed and intact tablets can affect osimertinib 
exposure. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Basic  pharmacokinetic  properties  for  osimertinib  are  overall  well  characterized.  An  important  feature  of 
osimertinib is the covalent binding to proteins. This property is desirable form a pharmacodynamics point of 
view, however it causes a very long retention time of the drug in the body which could have impact on the 
long-term safety osimertinib treatment (see RMP). 
Overall, the clinical pharmacology study package for osimertinib is considered sufficient for a conditional 
approval although relevant information is still missing in order to fully characterise the PK and PD profile of 
osimertinib.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
•  A clinical study to assess the absolute bioavailability of a single oral dose of osimertinib with respect to an 
intravenous microdose of [14C]osimertinib in healthy male subjects 
•  A clinical study to determine the PK, Safety and Tolerability of osimertinib following a single oral dose to 
patients with normal hepatic function or mild or moderate hepatic impairment 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/15445/2016 
Page 55/134 
  
  
 
•  A reduced-dosing clinical study in patients with severe renal impairment 
•  A clinical study to assess the potential for DDI with a non-CYP3A4 mediated PXR substrate and the potential 
for P-gp inhibition should be conducted. 
•  A study investigating the potential for transporter inhibition taking into account the covalent binding and 
very limited identification of recovered radioactive material. More reliable estimation of plasmatic protein 
binding and binding to the transporters studies should be obtained from in vitro studies. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
The AURA Phase I study was an open-label, multicentre study of osimertinib administered orally to 355 patients 
with advanced NSCLC designed to support a dose selection decision. The study included a substantial number of 
pre-treated patients with advanced NSCLC in the dose escalation (N=31) and dose expansion (n = 312, 
including 252 pre-treated patients, 12 pre-treated patients dosed with 80 mg Phase I tablet and 60 first-line 
patients) parts of the study, with a total of 283 pre-treated patients dosed with osimertinib capsule formulation 
across the range of doses tested (20, 40, 80, 160, and 240 mg). These 283 patients include 103 who were dosed 
with the capsule formulation at the recommended daily dose of 80 mg.  
Expansion cohorts were included to investigate specific patient subgroups (according to tumour EGFR T790M 
mutation status) and to evaluate pharmacodynamic changes (paired biopsy cohorts in patients with EGFR 
T790M mutation tumours).  In addition, 1 cohort of pre-treated EGFR patients (not selected by tumour EGFR 
T790M mutation status) received 80 mg of osimertinib as Phase 1 tablet formulation (n = 12; United States [US] 
only).  One additional patient assigned to treatment died before receiving the first dose of osimertinib.  Efficacy 
analyses were based on investigator assessment; a BICR assessment was also conducted in the subset of 63 
pre-treated patients with T790M mutation-positive NSCLC who received osimertinib 80 mg.  The study was 
ongoing at DCO (1 May 2015).

comply with study procedures, restrictions and requirements 
Treatments 
The recommended osimertinib oral daily dose of 80 mg was selected from a review of all available safety, 
tolerability, PK, and efficacy data from AURA Phase I 
Patients (with the exception of patients with insulin-dependent diabetes) had to fast for ≥1 hour prior to taking 
a dose to ≥ 2 hours after dosing. Water was permitted during this fasting period. 
Patients continued on treatment with osimertinib until RECIST v1.1-defined progression or until a treatment 
discontinuation criterion was met. There was no maximum duration of treatment as patients could continue to 
receive osimertinib beyond RECIST v1.1-defined progression as long as they continued to show clinical benefit, 
as judged by the investigator. 
Objectives 
AURA extension 
Primary objective:  
To investigate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy (ORR) of osimertinib when given orally to patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic NSCLC who had progressed following prior therapy with an EGFR-TKI agent.   
Key secondary objectives:  
To obtain additional assessments of the anti-tumour activity of osimertinib by evaluation of DoR, DCR, tumour 
shrinkage, PFS, using RECIST v1.1 as assessed by a BICR of radiological information, and OS; and to 
characterise the pharmacokinetics of osimertinib and its metabolites (AZ5104 and AZ7550) after multiple oral 
doses 
AURA 2 
Primary Objective:  
To investigate the efficacy (ORR by BICR) of orally administered osimertinib. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/15445/2016 
Page 63/134 
  
  
 
Key Secondary Objectives:  
To further assess the efficacy of osimertinib in terms of DoR, DCR, tumour shrinkage, and PFS as assessed by 
BICR; to investigate the safety and tolerability profile of osimertinib and to characterise the pharmacokinetics of 
osimertinib and its metabolites; to investigate the effect of osimertinib on QTc interval after oral dosing to 
NSCLC patients 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint variable was the ORR according to RECIST 1.1 by BICR using the 
evaluable for response analysis set. 
The ORR was defined as the percentage of patients with at least 1 visit response of CR or PR that was confirmed 
at least 4 weeks later (ie, a BOR of CR or PR). Data obtained up until progression, or the last evaluable 
assessment in the absence of progression, were included in the assessment of ORR. However, any CR or PR that 
occurred after a further anti-cancer therapy was received was not included in the numerator of the ORR 
calculation. Assessment were carried out every 6 weeks. For each patient, the BICR defined the overall visit 
response as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD) or not 
evaluable (NE) and the relevant scan dates for each time point (ie, for visits where response or progression was 
or was not identified). 
From the investigators’ review of the imaging scans, the RECIST tumour response data were used to determine 
each patient’s visit response for TLs, NTLs) and new lesions. Patients with brain metastases, asymptomatic, 
stable and not requiring steroids for at least 4 weeks prior to start of study treatment, were included in the 
study; any brain metastases present at baseline were recorded as NTL.Sensitivity analyses of ORR were 
performed using the investigators’ assessments of RECIST and the concordance between the ORR as assessed 
by BICR and as assessed by the investigator summarised using those patients evaluable for response by both 
investigator and BICR. 
Patients with brain metastases (which had to be asymptomatic, stable and not requiring steroids for at least 4 
weeks prior to the start of study treatment) were included in the study; any brain metastases present at 
baseline were recorded as non-target lesions (NTL) 
Secondary endpoints 
- 
Duration of response 
The DoR was defined as the time from the date of first documented response, (that is subsequently confirmed) 
until the date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression. The end of response 
should coincide with the date of progression or death from any cause used for the PFS endpoint. The time of the 
initial response was defined as the latest of the dates contributing towards the first visit response of PR or CR.  
- 
Disease control rate 
The DCR was defined as the percentage of patients who had a BOR of CR or PR or SD for at least 6 weeks 
(allowing for a 1-week visit window) 
- 
Tumour shrinkage 
Tumour size is the sum of the longest diameters of the TLs. The best percentage change in tumour size from 
baseline was determined for each patient, ie, the maximum reduction from baseline or the minimum increase 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/15445/2016 
Page 64/134 
  
  
 
from baseline in the absence of a reduction from baseline based on all post-baseline assessments prior to 
progression or the start of subsequent anticancer therapy.  
- 
Progression-free survival 
The PFS was defined as the time from date of first dose until the date of objective disease progression as defined 
by RECIST or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the patient withdrew 
from osimertinib therapy or received another anti-cancer therapy prior to progression.  
- 
Overall survival 
Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of first dose until death due to any cause.  
Exploratory endpoints 
The following PROs were collected: 
- 
- 
The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire – Core 
30 items (EORTC QLQ-C30) 
The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire – Lung 
Cancer 13 items (EORTC QLQ-LC13) 
Sample size 
AURA extension Study 
The primary endpoint of this Phase II extension part of the AURA study was ORR. The extension phase was to 
recruit approximately 175 patients with EGFR T790M mutation positive advanced NSCLC, whose disease had 
progressed following either 1 prior therapy with an EGFR TKI (2nd-line; no additional lines of therapy, n=50) or 
following treatment with at least 2 lines of prior therapy including at least 1 EGFR TKI and potentially other 
anticancer therapies (≥ 3rd-line, n=125). 
With 175 patients, the precision of the estimation of ORR in the overall study population would be within ±8% 
(e.g. ORR 40%, 95% CI: 33.0%, 47.4%). The precision of the estimation of ORR would be within ±13% in the 
50 patient cohort who have only received previous TKI treatment and within ±9% in the 125 patient cohort who 
have received previous TKI treatment and other anti-cancer therapy. The study also provided an adequate 
number of patients in which to assess the safety and tolerability of osimertinib; if zero events were observed in 
the 175 patients, there would be 95% confidence (2 sided) that the true event rate was less than 2.2%. 
AURA 2 STUDY 
The primary endpoint of this study was ORR. The study was to recruit approximately 175 patients with EGFR 
T790M mutation positive locally advanced NSCLC or metastatic NSCLC whose disease had progressed following 
either 1 prior therapy with an EGFR TKI (2nd-line, n=50) or following treatment with both EGFR TKI and a 
platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (patients may have also received additional lines of treatment; 
≥3rd-line, n=125). 
With 175 patients, the precision of the estimation of ORR in the overall study population would be within ±8% 
(eg, ORR 40%, 95% CI 33.0%, 47.4%). The precision of the estimation of ORR would be within ±13% in the 
cohort who have only received previous TKI treatment and within ±9% in the cohort who have received previous 
TKI treatment and other anti-cancer therapy. The study also provided an adequate number of patients in which

to assess the safety and tolerability of osimertinib; if zero events were observed in the 175 patients, there would 
be 95% confidence (2 sided) that the true event rate was less than 2.2%. 
Randomisation

Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable since both studies were single-arm and open-label studies. 
Statistical methods 
AURA extension and AURA2 studies 
Descriptive statistics were used for all variables. Continuous variables were summarised by the number of 
observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum. Categorical variables were 
summarised by frequency counts and percentages for each category. Unless otherwise stated, percentages 
were calculated based on the full analysis set (FAS). 
The FAS was defined as all patients enrolled who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. 
Summaries of demography and all safety data summaries and analyses were produced based on the FAS. 
The following efficacy analyses were conducted in the FAS: 
- 
PFS by BICR 
-  Sensitivity analysis of ORR and best objective response (BOR) by BICR 
- 
Investigator RECIST outcomes 
-  QoL 
The evaluable for response analysis set was defined as all patients who received at least 1 dose of study 
treatment and had measurable disease at baseline according to the BICR of baseline imaging data. 
The primary analysis of ORR, BOR, DoR, DCR and tumour shrinkage by BICR were produced based on the 
evaluable for response analysis set (patients evaluable for response by BICR). 
Primary endpoint 
The primary analysis of ORR will be presented together with 95% exact (Clopper-Pearson) confidence interval 
(CI) by study and overall. Overall ORR based on the pooled data will be calculated as the number (%) of patient 
with best objective response of confirmed CR or PR from both studies. 
The similar analysis of ORR will also be presented by treatment cohort (2nd- versus ≥ 3rd-line) and overall. The 
ORR in each treatment cohort based on the pooled data will be calculated as the number (%) of patients with 
best objective response of confirmed CR or PR from each treatment cohort across two studies. 
Secondary endpoints 
In both studies the secondary outcomes variables were DoR, DCR, tumour shrinkage and PFS, according to 
RECIST 1.1 using assessments performed by a BICR. A further secondary variable was OS. 
-  Duration of response 
Assessment report

If the response was not confirmed, it was not included. If a patient did not progress following a response, then 
their DoR used the PFS censoring time. DoR (months) in responding patients based on the BICR will be 
summarised using the median and 95% CI. The median will be calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The 
number and percentage of responding patients remaining in response at >3; >6; >9; >12 months will be 
summarised. The above analyses will be presented by study and overall. For overall DoR, the responding 
patients from both studies will be included in the analyses. A Kaplan-Meier plot will be presented for overall 
pooled population. The similar analysis of DoR will be presented by treatment cohort and overall. For DoR in 
each treatment cohort, the responding patients from each treatment cohort across two studies will be included 
in the analyses. A Kaplan-Meier plot will be presented for each treatment cohort. 
- 
Tumour shrinkage 
To assess the depth of tumour shrinkage, the proportion of patients who achieved >30%, >50% and >75% 
reduction in TL tumour size was summarised descriptively.The percentage change in TL tumour size from 
baseline was summarised using descriptive statistics and presented for each visit. 
The best percentage change from baseline in TL tumour size was summarised descriptively and presented 
graphically using waterfall plots. In the following situations where patients’ best percentage change data would 
have been missing, the value of +20% was imputed: 
If a patient had no postbaseline assessments and had died 
If a patient had new lesions or progression of NTLs 
If a patient had withdrawn due to disease progression and had no evaluable TL data before or at 
progression 
- 
Progression-free survival 
PFS will be displayed using a Kaplan-Meier plot for overall pooled population. The total number of events, 
median PFS (calculated from the Kaplan-Meier plot, with 95% CIs), and the percentage PFS at 3, 6, 12 and 18 
months will be summarised by study and overall. Similar analyses of PFS will be presented by treatment cohort 
and overall. A Kaplan-Meier plot will be presented for each treatment cohort. 
-  Overall survival 
Any patient not known to have died at the time of analysis was censored based on the last recorded date on 
which the patient was known to be alive. 
Sensitivity analysis 
Sensitivity analyses of ORR, DCR, DoR, tumour shrinkage and PFS using the investigators assessment of RECIST 
will be performed in an analogous manner to those using the BICR described above. 
The concordance between ORR as assessed by BICR and by investigator will be presented by study and overall 
based on the FAS. 
Subgroup analysis 
The consistency of the ORR and DoR by BICR across the following key subgroups will also be evaluated based on 
pooled data across two studies. The analysis of ORR together with 95% exact (Clopper-Pearson) CI will be 
presented by treatment cohort and overall within each category of the key subgroups. DoR (months) in 
responding patients based on the BICR will be summarised using the median and 95% CI by treatment cohort 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/15445/2016 
Page 67/134 
  
  
 
and overall within each category of the key subgroups. The median will be calculated using the Kaplan-Meier 
method. Kaplan-Meier plots will be presented for DoR within each category of the key subgroups for the overall 
pooled population to ensure that the median estimates within subgroups are not over-interpreted in these 
potentially small subgroups where the data may be limited and not mature at the primary analysis. 
o  Patients who received EGFR-TKI as last treatment prior to study start (further split into whether 
EGFR-TKI was <30 days or ≥30 days prior to first dose of osimertinib) and those whose treatment prior 
to study start was not an EGFR-TKI 
o  Ethnicity (Asian versus Non-Asian) 
o  Gender (Male versus Female) 
o  Age at screening (<65 versus ≥65) 
o  Mutation status prior to start of study (Exon 19 deletion/L858R/Other) 
o  Duration of most recent prior EGFR-TKI (<6 months versus ≥6 months) 
o  Smoking history 
o  Brain metastases at entry 
o  Patients with T790M+ detected in their baseline plasma sample (ctDNA) and patients that are T790M- 
by the plasma test 
o  Region (North America/Asia/Europe and rest of world) 
Forest plots of ORR by BICR for the above defined subgroups will be constructed for each treatment cohort and 
overall. 
Interim analyses 
There were no formal interim analyses planned for this study, but 2 DCO points were planned at approximately 
3 months and 8 months after the last patient had been enrolled. This report covers analyses from the 8-month 
DCO. The final database will be locked at the end of the study, at 12 to 24 months after the last patient was 
enrolled.

Recruitment 
AURA extension 
The first patient started treatment on 14 May 2014 and the last patient started treatment on 21 October 2014. 
The DCO for this report was 1 May 2015. 
The study was open for enrolment at 46 study centres in Japan (16), the USA (7), South Korea (4), Australia (3), 
France (3), Germany (3), Spain (3), Italy (3), Taiwan (2) and the UK (2). Patients were both screened and 
recruited at 40 centres in 10 countries; 50.7% of patients were from Asia, 20.4% from North America, and 
28.9% from Europe and rest of world. 
AURA 2 
The first patient started treatment on 13 June 2014 and the last patient started treatment on 27 October 2014. 
The DCO for this report was 1 May 2015. 
The study was open for enrolment at 44 study centres in Canada (3), Hong Kong (2), Italy (5), Japan (14), 
South Korea (3), Spain (6), Taiwan (2) and the USA (9);51.9% of patients were from Asia, 31.9% were from 
North America and 16.2% were from Europe and rest of world. 
Conduct of the study 
AURA extension 
There were 19 patients identified as having protocol deviations for review; 5 did not fulfil eligibility criteria, 9 
protocol-required procedures were not adhered to, and 5 other reasons. 
Key Protocol amendments (all the amendments were carried out before the start of patients recruitment): 
a) Amendment 1 (29 March 2013): Additional clarifications regarding efficacy assessments such as PFS 
up to and beyond discontinuation of study treatment were included. Details of RECIST version 1.1 
assessments and safety data requirements beyond discontinuation of study treatment but prior to 
disease progression were updated An option to enter patients into the study using local tumour EGFR 
T790M mutation status testing was added 
b) Amendment 3 (27 February 2014): Amended to add a Phase II extension study (study title and all 
sections of this report). Addition of optional CSF sample collection 
AURA 2 
There were 25 patients identified as having protocol deviations for review; 12 did not fulfil eligibility criteria, 6 
protocol-required procedures were not adhered to, and 5 other reasons. Of these deviations, there were 7 
patients in the ≥3rd-line cohort who received 2 or more prior treatment regimens but did not have a 
platinum-containing doublet regimen as treatment for advanced NSCLC, as required in inclusion criterion 5. Two 
other protocol deviations were considered important protocol deviations with the potential to impact the primary 
assessment of efficacy: 
Two patients had their tumour assessment performed more than 28 days before first dose 
• 
Protocol amendments:

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint: Objective response rate 
As of the DCO of 1 May 2015, the median treatment exposure of patients treated in the ongoing AURA extension 
and AURA2 studies was 7.7 months (range: <0.1 month to 11.6 months). All patients had at least 6 months 
follow-up from first dose.

Duration of response 
The median DoR based on BICR assessment had not been reached yet (22.8% maturity); however, the lower 
limit of the 95% CI was 8.3 months. The median DoR based on investigator assessment (27.6% maturity) was 
8.5 months (95% CI: 8.5, NC).

Fifty-seven of the 139 patients who progressed and were still alive at DCO (41.0%) subsequently received other 
anti-cancer therapies, the most frequent of which were platinum-based chemotherapy (27 patients, 19.4%) and 
non-platinum-based cytotoxic chemotherapy (22 patients, 15.8%); 11 patients (7.9%) received an EGFR-TKI. 
Overall survival 
Overall survival data are currently immature. At DCO, median follow-up for OS was 7.4 months.

Assessment of EGFR T790M mutation status 
In the phase I extension cohort of study D5160C00001 (AURA Extension), T790M+ patients were screened for 
enrollment using the cobas EGFR Mutation Test v1 using tissue. In AZ study D5160C00002 (AURA2), patients 
were screened for enrollment using the cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2 in tissue to identify those who harboured 
an EGFR sensitizing mutation and a T790M mutation. In both of these trials, plasma samples were collected at 
baseline and while on therapy for use in exploratory analyses.  
Comparison of cobas plasma test vs cobas tissue test  
In the method comparison 383 patients in AURA2 who provided adequate tissue for testing were prospectively 
screened for T790M mutation using the cobas tissue test. Of these patients, 344 (89.8%) also provided a plasma 
sample. EGFR T790M mutation status was compared in the tissue and plasma samples from these 344 patients

(Table 36). Not all patients who were tissue T790M mutation positive at screening were dosed in the studies, 
since some patients failed screening for reasons unrelated to mutation status.

The numbers of elderly patients dosed with osimertinib 80 mg from AURA Phase I, AURA extension and AURA2 
are provided in the table below. 
Table 39: Number of patients dosed with osimertinib 80 mg in the non-controlled AURA Phase I, 
AURA extension and AURA2 trials 
Supportive study(ies) 
Data from AURA phase I (dose-escalation and dose expansion parts) provides some information on the duration 
of response to be expected with osimertinib in the current indication.  Investigator-based efficacy data from all 
pre-treated patients with centrally-confirmed T790M mutation-positive NSCLC who received osimertinib at 
doses ranging from 20 mg to 240 mg in AURA phase I dose-expansion (n = 163), with particular focus on the 
subset of 63 pre-treated EGFR T790M mutation-positive patients who received the 80 mg dose of osimertinib, 
has been presented. Response assessment based on confirmed objective responses as determined by BICR was 
available for the 80 mg T790M mutation-positive subset of patients. Sixty of the 63 pre-treated patients with 
centrally-confirmed T790M mutation-positive NSCLC treated with osimertinib 80 mg were evaluable for 
response based on BICR assessment of baseline imaging data. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/15445/2016 
Page 86/134 
 
 
 
  
  
 
The demographics and disease characteristics at baseline are quite similar between the patients in the phase II 
pooled population and the 163 patients in AURA phase I dose-expansion study.  
In the 37 pre-treated patients with EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC who had a confirmed response by 
BICR in the 80 mg cohort (ORR 61.7% 95%CI 48.2-73.9) the median DoR from first documentation of objective 
response by Kaplan-Meier method, based on BICR data, was 9.7 months (95% CI: 8.3, NC).  
In the subset of 63 pre-treated patients with centrally-confirmed T790M mutation-positive NSCLC who received 
80 mg osimertinib, the median PFS based on BICR was 11.0 months (95% CI: 7.0, 15.2). 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
EGFR-mutant NSCLC is characterised by exhibiting sensitivity to EGFR TKIs such as erlotinib and gefitinib; 
nevertheless, usually acquired resistance develops after a median of 9–14 months (N. Engl. J. Med. 361, 
947–957; 2009). The most common mechanism of TKI resistance is a second-site mutation (T790M) in the 
EGFR kinase domain, which could be found in 50-60% of biopsies carried out (Clin. Cancer Res. 17, 1169–1180; 
2011). In these patients, the therapeutic alternatives are scarce, with chemotherapy and TKI re-challenge, as 
the preferred options. 
The recommended daily dose of 80 mg for osimertinib was established during the AURA phase I study has 
demonstrated a positive benefit/risk profile that maximises clinical activity in patients with EGFR T790M 
mutation-positive NSCLC, while simultaneously minimising the incidence and severity of adverse reactions as 
well as dose modifications.  Importantly, this dose ensures that patients will receive a clinically active dose 
regardless of inter-patient variability and allows prescribers to reduce the dose should this be necessary. 
Additionally, preclinical modelling indicates that the 80 mg dose is likely to provide better activity than the 40 mg 
dose in brain metastases. The doses of 160 mg and 240 mg were clearly less tolerable than the 80-mg dose, 
with no perceivable benefit in efficacy. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The overall goal of the single-arm trials was to show clinically meaningful benefit in the proposed indication, with 
prospective replication of data across 2 studies.  Both studies had very similar designs in terms of the patient 
population (i.e. similar inclusion criteria, similar proportion of 2nd-line and ≥ 3d-line), conduct, and outcome 
measures (same schedule of radiological assessments). 
Patients were either 2nd-line patients (i.e. after one EGFR TKI) or ≥3rd-line patients (after EGFR TKI and at 
least one other regimen). The presence of mutations known to be associated with EGFR TKI sensitivity was only 
introduced in the AURA 2 study. Patients with brain metastases were included in the study; any brain 
metastases present at baseline were recorded as non-target lesions (NTL). 
Mutation status was determined using Roche cobas EGFR mutation test based on biopsies from the patients after 
progression on their most recent line of therapy. A validated test should be performed using either tumour DNA 
derived from a tissue sample or circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) obtained from a plasma sample. Only robust, 
reliable and sensitive tests with demonstrated utility for the determination of T790M mutation status of tumour 
derived DNA (from a tissue or a plasma sample) should be used. Positive determination of T790M mutation 
status using either a tissue-based or plasma-based test indicates eligibility for treatment with osimertinib. 
However, if a plasma-based ctDNA test is used and the result is negative, it is advisable to follow-up with a tissue 
test wherever possible due to the potential for false negative results using a plasma-based test (see section 4.4 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/15445/2016 
Page 87/134 
  
  
 
of the SmPC).. With the proposed testing strategy, 50-60% of all patients potentially eligible for osimertinib 
treatment could avoid an invasive procedure.  
In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint variable was the ORR according to RECIST 1.1 by BICR using the 
evaluable for response analysis set. Even though the use of ORR as primary endpoint would not be the 
recommended primary endpoint, however given the design of the studies and the unmet medical need, this 
could be acceptable, in particular considering the request for conditional approval. 
In both studies the secondary outcomes variables were DoR, DCR, tumour shrinkage and PFS, according to 
RECIST 1.1 using assessments performed by a BICR. A further secondary variable was OS. 
Even though no formal interim analysis has been pre-planned, the results submitted for both studies are based 
on the DCO 1st May 2015, approximately 6 months after the last patient was enrolled, to allow for at least a 6 
month follow-up after the first dose. 
A total of 873 patients signed informed consent and started screening  in AURA extension (401) and AURA2 
(472). In both studies a high proportion of patients was not assigned to study treatment because of the absence 
of confirmatory T790M mutation in the majority of the cases. 
The percentage of discontinuations of study drug is low in both studies (16% and 14%) probably as a 
consequence of the duration of the study (DCO: 1st May 2015) 
Overall, the included patients appear to represent the target population, i.e. relatively young (63 years as the 
median age), non-smoking (71.5%) female patients (67.9%) with tumours of adenocarcinoma histology (83%). 
The demographics and baseline characteristics are very similar for the patients in the two phase II studies and 
also across lines of therapy. The vast majority of the patients included in the studies are Asian (60.1%) 
reflecting the higher incidence of EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC in Asian patients. A sufficient number of white 
patients (36.2%) is also included in the two studies in order to ensure an assessment which is representative of 
a European population as well. 
The cohorts in both studies seem to be reasonably balanced. In the AURA extension study, there were almost 
37% of patients with brain metastases. In the AURA 2 study, the presence of brain metastases was reported in 
42% of subjects and there seem to be more brain metastases in the 3rd-line cohort (46% vs 34%). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Results based on the primary endpoint are considered clinically meaningful. Confirmed ORR in the pooled 
evaluable population according to the BICR assessment was 66%. The proportion of patients in AURA extension 
study that obtained antitumor activity from osimertinib was 60.7% and 61.6% (2nd and 3rd-line cohorts 
respectively). All the responses were partials. In the AURA 2 study the ORR was 73% and 69.9% (2nd and 
3rd-line cohorts respectively), with only two patients in complete response. Results according to the assessment 
of the investigators were similar to those obtained by the BICR.  Of note, among the proportion of patients with 
non-response, the percentage of subjects with stable disease ≥6 weeks ranged from 20.6% to 29.1%, which is 
of clinical value and will likely have an impact on the PFS data. 
Focusing on the analysis of subgroups in the pooled data, this analysis reveals differences in ORRs between 
patients with different EGFR mutations (69.6% in patients with Exon 19 deletion versus 58.9% in patients with 
L858R mutation), and also between Asian (70.0%) and non-Asian patients (60.2%). Differences in efficacy 
between different EGFR-mutation types have been observed in earlier reports which suggests that the exon 19 
deletion might have a higher sensitivity to EGFR TKIs compared with L858R (Riely et al 2006, Fukuoka et al 
2011, Kim et al 2011, Sequist et al 2013, Karachaliou et al 2015). However, after the review of baseline 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/15445/2016 
Page 88/134 
  
  
 
demographics, weight/exposure and efficacy data provided, there is no clear explanation to the observed 
differences in response between subgroups of patients with different ethnicity. No differences were noted 
between the two cohorts of both studies (2nd and 3rd-line) 
The median duration of the response according to the BICR has not been achieved yet (95% CI 8.3-NC) which 
can be expected given the low maturity of the data (22.8%). However, data from investigator assessment 
provide a median DoR of 8.5 months, with 96.2% of responders showing a documented objective response at 
their second scheduled follow-up scan (Week 12 ± 1 week; according BICR). The DoR based on investigator 
assessment seems to be in line with the data from the phase I study, with a percentage of maturity for DoR of 
46% (% progressed or died by BICR) the median DoR being 9.7 months (BICR; 95% CI 8.3-NC). 
Most of the studied patients had confirmed tumour shrinkage, which suggest that osimertinib is active in most 
of the NSCLC patients with T790M mutation-positive tumours.  
Data on PFS from the pooled phase II studies and phase I trial, show a median PFS around 10-11 months, with 
39% and 52% of events respectively. Analyses of subgroups based on PFS do not suggest any subsets of 
patients where the efficacy of osimertinib could be worse than in the whole population, even though these data 
should be taken very cautiously due to the immaturity and sample size of the some subgroups. 
OS data are not mature enough so as to reach any conclusion 
The absence of comparator represents an uncertainty in this application, however the historical ORR obtained by 
chemotherapy, or TKI re-challenge, are considerably lower than those seen in the AURA studies. Even in the 
worst-case scenario of a response rate of 50% and DoR of 6 months (lower 95%CI for the AURA extension study 
is 54.2%), this seems superior to that described in the literature for alternative treatments. The objective 
response rate with 2nd line chemotherapy agents has been described around 25-30% at best (Dong et al 2014; 
J Int Med Res. 2014 Feb;42(1):191-7.), whereas the proportion of patients previously treated with TKI and 
achieving a response when re-challenged with another TKI hardly exceed 10-20%. In fact the re-challenge with 
TKI after failure of erlotinib, gefitinib, or both, and one or two lines of chemotherapy, was tested in the LUX-Lung 
1 study with afatinib, obtaining response rates of 7.4% (Lancet Oncol. 2012 May;13(5):528-38). Furthermore, 
the recent results from the IMPRESS trial (Mok et al 2014) where patients who had progressed on first-line 
gefitinib, were treated with cisplatin/pemetrexed or cisplatin/pemetrexed with continuation of gefitinib showed 
no differences in terms of PFS and ORR (median PFS was 5.4 months, and 25% of patients had response). These 
results have been recently supported by Halmos et al (The Oncologist 2015; 20: 1298–1303). 
Therefore, it is highly plausible that the response seen in the AURA studies can be deemed superior to the 
different alternatives usually offered to these patients, indicating a new valuable option for patients with 
presence of T790M mutation 
Although no clinical studies have been conducted, osimertinib is expected to be effective in first line treatment 
in the presence of the T790M mutation. The applicant is currently conducting a “Phase III, Double-blind, 
Randomised Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of osimertinib versus a Standard of Care EGFR TKI as First 
Line Treatment in Patients with EGFR Mutation Positive, Locally Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC”. This study will 
explore the efficacy of osimertinib in first line, including patients with the presence of the T790M mutation, if any 
is ultimately included. The contribution of the study results to provide supportive evidence for the use of 
osimertinib in first line patients harbouring the T790M could be relevant as long as there are enough patients 
with the T790M mutation. However, given the very low prevalence of this mutation in first line (Mok et al 2009; 
Inukai et al 2006; Sequist et al 2008), the real contribution of this phase 3 trial is expected to be limited.

From a mechanistic point of view, there is no foreseen impact of previous treatment on the expected benefit 
from treatment with osimertinib in patients with T790M mutation. Nevertheless, the consequence of moving the 
chemotherapy to 2nd-line is unknown in terms of life expectancy. As explaining by Yun et al (Proc Natl Acad Sci 
U S A. 2008 Feb 12;105 (6):2070-5), substitution of threonine 790 with methionine (T790M) has been thought 
to cause resistance by steric interference with binding of TKIs, including gefitinib and erlotinib. Osimertinib is 
therefore considered the optimal treatment alternative over available EGFR TKI therapies in patients with 
advanced EGFR positive NSCLC in the presence of T790M, regardless of the line of therapy.  
Taking as a reference the most recent study of chemotherapy in first line in EGFR mutation positive patients, the 
LUX-Lung 3 study (afatinib vs cisplatin plus pemetrexed chemotherapy) it can be observed that the ORR for 
chemotherapy was 23% and 44% (independent and investigator assessment respectively) with a median 
duration of response of 5.5 months. In the EURTAC study, the best overall response rate for chemotherapy was 
10.5%, whereas in the IPASS study, ORR for chemotherapy was 47% (EGFR+). In all of them the use of TKIs 
offered better results in response rate and PFS. It is therefore reasonable to expect that osimertinib in first line 
treatment of patients with T790M mutation will have a higher activity than chemotherapy as well. But in the 
worst case scenario, where osimertinib had a similar efficacy than chemotherapy, the better safety profile of this 
drug would make it a more suitable treatment option. 
Therefore, based on the above efficacy and safety considerations, a broad indication in patients with T790M 
mutation can reasonably be recommended.  
It is expected that the use of osimertinib in first line will be limited since the testing for the presence of T790M 
in EGFR positive NSCLC (first line) is not routinely performed because of the low prevalence of this mutation in 
patients not previously exposed to TKIs therapies. 
Although the PRO data do not suggest deterioration of the patient’s quality of life, the design of the two phase 
II studies (open-label, uncontrolled) makes it difficult to conclude on the clinical relevance of symptomatic 
improvement in patients treated with osimertinib. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
The AURA3 study (D5160C00003) is a phase III, open label randomised study of osimertinib vs. platinum-based 
doublet chemotherapy for patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose disease has progressed 
with previous EGFR TKI therapy and whose tumours harbour an EGFR T790M mutation within the EGFR gene. 
The primary endpoint is PFS and the secondary endpoints include ORR, DoR, DCR and OS. The results from 
AURA3 are expected to be submitted by 30 June 2017. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The high antitumor activity shown by osimertinib in the two phase II studies carried out is considered of clinical 
value. Osimertinib is a new alternative before chemotherapy, with outstanding response rates. It is expected 
this will be translated into clinical benefit for patients, although the magnitude of such benefit in terms of OS 
and/or PFS remains unknown. Results from the ongoing phase III study (AURA 3) will need to be provided to 
address this uncertainty.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the context of a 
conditional MA: 
In order to further confirm the efficacy of osimertinib in the treatment of patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC, the applicant should submit the final results of the phase III

study AURA3 comparing osimertinib to platinum-based doublet chemotherapy by 30 June 2017. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety assessment was limited to the population of enrolled patients who received at least one dose of study 
drug (the safety population) which is also the defined full analysis set (FAS). Adverse events and SAEs were 
collected from the time of informed consent, throughout the treatment period and including the safety follow-up 
period (defined as 28 days after study drug was discontinued). 
Patient exposure 
Overall extent of exposure: Clinical program 
Based on an informal DCO of 01 June 2015 at least 1221 subjects have been exposed to study treatment 
(osimertinib alone or in combination). Dose levels ranged from 20 mg to 240 mg. 
Seventy (70) subjects were exposed to osimertinib in combination with another treatment.  
Overall subject exposure included 591 subjects who participated in Phase I studies, 411 subjects who 
participated in the Phase II programme and 149 subjects who participated in the Phase III programme.  
In the Phase II studies 333 (81.0%) patients received osimertinib for longer than 6 months and 97 patients 
(23.6%) received osimertinib for longer than 9 months. In AURA Phase I, the pre-treated dose expansion 
population (n=271) provides the main contribution to additional safety information. In this population the 
median exposure to osimertinib is 8.2 months (251.0 days) and 162 (59.8%) patients received osimertinib for 
longer than 6 months. These patients with longer exposure provide additional safety information for the 
potential use of osimertinib in the longer term. At the DCO date for this study (01 May 2015), the longest 
duration of exposure to osimertinib across the clinical programme is from patients enrolled in AURA Phase I, in 
which patients have received up to 24.9 months (759 days) treatment with osimertinib to date (median 8.3 
months [253 days]). 
The main contributory safety data from AURA Phase I are from the pre-treated capsule expansion cohort. 
Overall extent of exposure: Phase II studies (AURA ext and AURA2) 
Given the almost identical study designs of AURA extension and AURA2, safety data were pooled to provide 
increased sensitivity and precision towards the evaluation of the safety and tolerability profile of osimertinib in 
the proposed indication, compared to each individual trial using the same testing methodology. Data from AURA 
Phase I are presented as additional information towards the primary safety assessment provided by the Phase 
II pooled dataset.  
The median total treatment duration was longer in the AURA extension study than in AURA2 due to an earlier 
recruitment period (8.2 months versus 7.4 months). 
At  the  time  of  DCO  for  these  clinical  studies,  01  May  2015,  296  patients  (72.0%)  in  the  Phase  II  studies 
remained  on  study  drug  treatment  (141  patients  (70.1%)  in  AURA  extension,  and  155  patients  [73.8%]  in 
AURA2) so exposure will increase with longer follow up. 
The majority of common AEs (ie, rash, diarrhoea) occur within the first few weeks of treatment.

Table 41: Treatment interruptions and dose reductions for osimertinib (Full analysis set) 
The median length of a dose interruption, excluding dose interruptions where the patient forgot to take their 
dose, was 7 days and ranged from 1 to 170 days. The maximum period for a dose interruption (170 days) 
appears to be as a result of a data entry error.  
In AURA extension, two additional patients who had AEs leading to interruptions were identified but are not 
included in the table above since they had not been entered in the dosing eCRF. Therefore, the total number of 
patients with interruptions caused by AEs in AURA extension is 38 (18.9%). In the total Phase II population, 77 
(18.7%) patients had dose interruptions due to AEs.

In  86.4%  (355/411)  of  patients,  AEs  were  considered  to  be  possibly  causally  related  to  osimertinib  by  the 
investigator. 
In the pooled analysis of the Phase II studies, the majority of patients (68.1%) experienced AEs of mild (Grade 
1:  30.4%)  to  moderate  (Grade  2:  37.7%)  severity.  the  most  commonly  reported  EGFR-associated  AEs  by 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA] PT) were diarrhoea, rash, dry skin and paronychia; these 
AEs were mostly mild to moderate in severity. AEs were most frequently reported in the SOCs of GI disorders 
(287/411; 69.8%), Skin disorders (264/411; 64.2%), and Infections (212/411; 51.6%). 
Dose interruptions, dose reductions and treatment discontinuations with osimertinib 80 mg due to AEs were 
reported for 18.7%, 4.4%, and 5.6% of patients respectively; the mean and median relative dose intensity (RDI) 
was 97.7% and 100.0% respectively.

Compared to the Phase II studies, the overall incidence of AEs of CTCAE ≥Grade 3 events in the Phase I study 
was  numerically  higher  (43.9%;  119/271)  of  pre-treated  patients  who  received  the  osimertinib  capsule 
formulation in the dose expansion part of the study. The AEs of ≥CTCAE Grade 3 reported in ≥5 patients were 
pulmonary embolism (3.7%; 10/271 patients), pneumonia (3.7%; 10/271 patients), anaemia (3.0%; 8/271 
patients), dyspnoea (2.6%; 7/271 patients), paronychia and diarrhoea (2.2% each reported in 6/271 patients), 
and neutrophil count decreased (1.8%; 5/271 patients).  
AEs of special interest 
A number of AESI have been identified based on pre-clinical findings, emerging data from clinical studies of 
osimertinib and pharmacological effects of approved EGFR TKIs. 
Pneumonia, pulmonary embolism and dyspnoea are the most common AEs of CTCAE Grade ≥3 in the Phase I 
and Phase II studies. These 3 AEs are described here in a more detailed assessment since they have not been 
identified as AESIs. 
Interstitial lung disease (ILD)

events  was  83  days  (range  17  to  230  days).  The  distribution  of  patients  is  as  follows:  7  Asian  patients,  4 
non-Asian patients, 8 reports were serious, while 3 reports were non-serious, 4 patients with CTCAE Grade 1 
AEs; 3 patients with CTCAE Grade 3 AEs, and 4 patients with fatal AEs (0.7%), 5 patients recovered, 1 patient 
was recovering, 1 patient had not recovered.  
Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) or ILD-like adverse reactions (e.g. pneumonitis) were reported in 2.9% and were 
fatal  in  0.3%  of  the  1221  patients  who  received  osimertinib  across  clinical  trials.  ILD  or  ILD-like  adverse 
reactions were reported in 11/411 (2.7%) of patients who received osimertinib in the two Phase II studies, of 
which  0.7%  were  Grade  3  or  4  and  1%  were  fatal.  The  incidence  of  ILD  was  6.2%  in  patients  of  Japanese 
ethnicity, 1.2% in patients of Asian ethnicity and 2.4% in non-Asian patients. The median time to onset of ILD 
or ILD-like adverse reactions was 2.7 months (See Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC).

Referring the recovery from the AEs, 11 (0.9%) patients recovered from the AE, 5 (0.4%) patients were 
recovering, 15 (1.2%) patients had not recovered. 
Treatment with the study drug was discontinued in 33 out of 35 patients with reported ILD, as per protocol. The 
majority  of  these  patients  were  treated  according  to  local  clinical  practice,  with  corticosteroids  and  often  in 
association with antibiotics to treat the differential diagnosis of respiratory infection. 
Cardiac effects 
Following a review of preclinical and EGFR TKI and HER2 class data, the applicant identified two cardiac topics of 
special interest to assess potential risks of cardiac toxicity. These are QT prolongation and reduction in cardiac 
contractility (including LVEF decreases). 
In the Phase II studies there were 19 (4.6%) patients with AEs in the Cardiac disorder SOC outside of the SMQs 
shows 20 [4.9%] patients with AEs, however, an AE of cardiac failure congestive reported in the AURA extension 
study was captured within the grouped terms SMQ of Cardiac failure. 
Adverse events with PTs in cardiac failure or cardiomyopathy SMQs were reported in 5 patients (1.2%) in the 
phase II studies. 
Left ventricular ejection fraction analysis 
No clinically significant change was observed in median LVEF from the baseline of 63% in the 195/210 patients 
(90.9%) who had at least one post-baseline echocardiograph assessment in Aura 2 study.  
QT prolongation 
In both Phase II studies an increase from baseline in median QTcF was observed, which reached a plateau by 
Cycle 3 Day 1. 
In AURA2 the mean time-matched change from baseline in QTcF at Week 6 across all time points was14.5 ms 
(90% CI 14.0, 15.0), with the maximum upper 90% CI limit at any time point being 17.5 ms.  
Data on QTcF intervals are summarised in the table below

Of the 411 Phase II patients, one patient was found to have a QTc greater than 500 msec, and 11 patients 
(2.7%) had an increase from baseline QTc greater than 60 msec 
AURA2  provided  the  primary  assessment  of  the  pro-arrhythmic  risk  of  osimertinib  in  line  with  ICH  E14, 
according to the applicant. The effect of both single and multiple dosing of osimertinib on QT/QTc interval was 
evaluated using extensive ECG sampling. 
Based on a c-QTc analysis, a drug-related QTc interval prolongation was observed in the AURA2 study.  The 
mean (90% CI) increase in ΔQTcF interval (based on time-matched change from baseline) was estimated to be 
0.271 (0.241 – 0.301) ms per 10 nM increase in osimertinib plasma levels, based on a linear mixed effects 
model, with gender not having a significant effect in the model. This resulted in a predicted mean drug-related 
QTcF interval prolongation at the proposed osimertinib therapeutic dose (80 mg) of 14.2 msec with an upper 
bound of the associated two-sided 90% CI of 15.8 msec.  
In AURA Phase I an increase from baseline in median QTcF was observed, which reached a plateau by Day 1of 
Cycle 3. The median change from baseline in QTcF on Day 1 of Cycle 3 was 12.3 msec when considering all 
doses. There appeared to be an increase of the QTcF effect with dose, with a median increase of 4.0 msec and 
9.0 msec on Day 1 of Cycle 3 (week 6) at the 20 mg and 40 mg dose levels respectively, while median increases 
of  12.7  msec,  16.3  msec  and  14.5  msec  were  reported  at  the  80  mg,  160  mg  and  240  mg  dose  levels, 
respectively. At the 160 mg and 240 mg dose levels, there were isolated occurrences where the median interval 
increase per cycle was greater than 20 msec. A total of 26.2% (71/271) of patients had a QTcF interval >450 
msec at any time during treatment. Six (2.2%) patients had a QTcF interval >480 msec and 1 (0.4%) patient 
had a QTcF interval >500 msec (522 msec). One fatal AE was reported in a patient treated with the 240 mg dose 
in this in the AURA1 study (Grade 5 Pulseless Electrical Activity). 
QT interval relevant cardiac AEs: 
Across the Phase II studies, there were no events of Torsade de Pointes (TdP) reported or of Sudden death; 
Ventricular tachycardia; Ventricular fibrillation and flutter.  
There was one CTCAE Grade 2 AE of syncope reported in a patient with a maximum QTcF 454 msec and a 
medical history of dizziness. This event was considered by the investigator not to be possibly causally related to 
osimertinib and resolved in 1 day. 
There were no reported AEs with PTs in the Arrhythmias standardised MedDRA queries (SMQ). In the Phase II 
studies, adverse events with PTs in the QT prolongation SMQ category were reported in 17 patients (4.1%); all 
reported PTs were Electrocardiogram QT Prolonged. Nine (2.2%) patients reported maximum Grade 1 events; 
3 (0.7%) reported maximum CTCAE Grade 2 events and 5 (1.2%) patients reported maximum CTCAE Grade 3 
events. Per protocol requirement, CTCAE Grade 3 QT prolongation events led to a dose interruption. 
One  fatal  AE  was  reported  in  a  patient  treated  with  the  240  mg  dose  in  AURA  Phase  I  (Grade  5  Pulseless 
Electrical Activity).

Table 47: Skin effects as reported in the pooled Phase II studies (AURA Extension and AURA2) 
A total of 51.8% (213/411) patients had maximum reported Grade 1 (mild) AEs of skin effects (grouped terms). 
Adverse events of maximum reported Grade 2 (moderate) or Grade 3 (severe) were reported for 7.5% (31/411) 
and 0.5% (2/411) of patients respectively. One Grade 3 event was maculo-papular rash. The other Grade 3 
event was for the PT of erythema. There were no SAEs. No skin-related AE led to hospitalisation. 
The most common anatomical locations for skin effects (grouped terms) AEs were the face (115/411; 43.2% 
patients) and hands (110/411; 41.4% patients). 
AEs leading to dose modifications were reported for 0.5% (2/411) patients (erythema and rash each reported 
for 1 patient) and 1 patient (0.2%) had an AE (rash maculo-papular) leading to permanent discontinuation. 
Adverse events of maximum reported Grade 2 (moderate) or Grade 3 (severe) were reported for 4.4% (18/411) 
and 0.5% (2/411) of patients respectively. The median time to onset of Rashes and Acnes was 20.5 days (range 
1 to 266) with a median duration of 122.0 days. After one month of treatment with osimertinib, the prevalence

of  rashes  and  acnes  (grouped  term)  remains  relatively  constant  over  the  duration  of  treatment,  with 
approximately 20% to 30% patients experiencing AEs in this grouped term at any one time point. Medication 
was  administered  for  37.4%  of  patients  with  rashes  and  acnes  AEs,  typically  consisting  of  topical  steroids. 
Treatments did not increase the resolution or decrease the duration of rash/acne. 
A total of 28.2% (116/411) patients had maximum reported Grade 1 (mild) AEs of dry skin (grouped term). 
Adverse events of maximum reported Grade 2 (moderate) were reported for 2.4% (10/411) of patients. There 
were no Grade  ≥3 AEs,  no SAEs, and no AEs that led to dose modifications or permanent discontinuations. 
Median time to onset of dry skin AEs was 26 days (range 1 to 255).  
• 
Diarrhoea 
Diarrhoea was reported in 42.3% (174/411) patients during treatment with osimertinib 80 mg. The majority of 
reported AEs of diarrhoea were considered mild in severity. A total of 35.8% (147/411) patients had maximum 
Grade 1 AEs of diarrhoea. Adverse events of maximum Grade 2 or 3 were reported for 5.1% (21/411) and 1.0% 
(4/411) patients respectively. No fatal AEs of diarrhoea were reported. Out of the 263 events of diarrhoea there 
was a single event that led to discontinuation of osimertinib. There were 4 patients with AEs that led to dose 
interruption. 
The overall median time to onset of first event of diarrhoea was 18.0 days (n=174; mean 43.0, range 1 to 251 
days), with a median total duration of all episodes of diarrhoea of 81.0 days (range 1 to 310 days).  
There were no events reported of GI perforation or haemorrhagic diarrhoea. 
At the DCO date, 183/263 (69.6%) events were reported to have resolved, 22/263 (8.4%) events were reported 
to be resolving, one event was reported to be resolved with sequelae, and 57/263 (21.7%) were reported to be 
ongoing. 
Less than half of all events of diarrhoea were treated (95/263 events; 36.1%). Antipropulsives (eg, loperamide) 
were administered for 77 events. Of the 95 treated events, 57 (21.7% of all events) events were reported to 
have resolved (4 of these patients also had a dose modification) and 34 (12.9% of all events) were reported to 
be ongoing at the DCO date of this data. For the 168 events where no treatment was given, 123 (46.8% of all 
events)  were  reported  to  have  resolved  and  44  (16.7%  of  all  events)  events  were  reported  to  be  ongoing 
without any dose modification at the DCO date of this analysis. 
The median total duration of all episodes of diarrhoea was 81.0 days (range  1 to 310 days) this calculation 
includes  AEs  of  intermittent,  sporadic,  or  occasional  diarrhoea  and  therefore  may  overestimate  the  median 
continuous duration due to the inclusion of days/periods without diarrhoea. 
Events were typically of low clinical significance with no requirement for medical intervention to prevent the 
development of complications such as dehydration or electrolyte disturbance. 
In the Phase II studies, three patients experienced diarrhoea concurrently with renal failure and/or dehydration 
(high level term). 
After one month of treatment with osimertinib the prevalence of diarrhoea remains relatively constant over the 
duration of treatment, with approximately 20% patients experiencing diarrhoea at any one point. 
In AURA Phase I: dose expansion cohort, diarrhoea was reported in 53.5% (145/271) of patients. Diarrhoea was 
reported in 42.3 % (41/97) of patients in the 80 mg cohort and the incidence increased in the 160 mg and 240 
mgdose levels (69.9%; 65/93 patients and 85.7%; 12/14 patients, respectively).

Upper GI Inflammation [and nasal mucosal] effects 
Upper GI inflammatory adverse events (grouped term) were reported in 22.6% (93/411) patients in the Phase 
II studies (during treatment with osimertinib 80 mg), including 11.9% (49/411) patients reporting stomatitis, 
3.2% (13/411) patients reporting oropharyngeal pain, 2.9% (12/411) patients reporting epistaxis and 2.4% 
(10/411) patients reporting dysphagia. All other PTs were reported in ≤2% of patients. All AEs of upper GI 
inflammatory events were Grade 1 (19.0%) or Grade 2 (3.4%) in severity. One grade 3 event of gastritis was 
reported in one patient (0.2%) which led to dose modification but was not considered related to osimertinib. 
There were no permanent discontinuations. The median time to onset of first event of upper GI inflammatory AE 
was 63.0 days (mean 77.3 days; range 1 to 263 days). A total of 125 events were reported for 93 patients. Less 
than half of the 125 events required treatment (57 events; 45.6 %). Of these 125 events, 69 (55.2 %) were 
reported to have resolved, 12 (9.6%) were reported to be resolving and 43 (34.4%) were reported to be 
ongoing at the DCO date of this analysis. 
Stomatitis was reported in 11.9% (49 of 411) patients during treatment with osimertinib 80 mg, with a similar 
frequency in both Phase II studies. The overall median time to onset of first event of stomatitis was 43 days 
(range 3 to 252 days). All reported AEs of stomatitis were considered Grade 1 (10.0%) or Grade 2 (1.9%) in 
severity. None of the 49 reported events of stomatitis required osimertinib discontinuation, dose interruption or 
dose modification. 
• 
Nail Effects 
Nail effects AEs were reported by 25.1% (103/411) of the patients across the Phase II studies during treatment 
with  osimertinib 80  mg.  The  most  commonly  reported  nail  effect  PT  was  paronychia  17.5%.  The  next  most 
frequently reported nail effect PTs were nail disorders (3.2%) and onychoclasis (2.7%). All reported AEs of nail 
effects were Grade 1 (19.7%) or Grade 2 (5.4%) in severity. No patients reported Grade ≥3 events of nail 
effects and no SAEs of nail effects were reported. The overall median time to onset of first event of nail effects 
was 70 days (range 1 to 296 days). 
No patients discontinued osimertinib due to a nail effect AE. One patient had a dose modification due to the nail 
effect AE paronychia. Less than half of all events of nail effects were treated (54 events; 42.5%). Of these 127 
events, 38 (29.9%) were reported to have resolved, 14 (11.0%) were reported to be resolving and 74 (58.3%) 
were reported to be ongoing at the DCO date of this analysis. 
A similar pattern of nail effect AEs was reported in AURA Phase I dose expansion cohort (29.5%), with the most 
commonly reported PT being paronychia (23.6%).  
• 
Ocular effects 
Osimertinib has not been associated with clinically significant ocular surface effects such as ulcerative keratitis, 
or severe or serious ocular AEs. 
Ocular effect (grouped term) AEs were reported by 11.2% (46/411) patients with a similar distribution between 
both Phase II studies. Ocular effects of conjunctival disorders were reported in 9.5% (39/411), corneal disorders 
in  0.7%  (3/411),  lacrimal  disorder  in  6.6%  (27/411)  and  periorbital/eyelid  disorders  in  1.7%  (7/411)  of 
patients. 
The most common PTs reported in the Ocular effects grouped terms were Dry Eye in 5.6% (23/411) patients and 
conjunctivitis in 2.9% (12/411) patients. No other PT was reported at a frequency ≥2%. Twenty-six patients 
(6.3%) with ocular effects AEs received treatment, but no ocular effects AEs led to permanent discontinuation 
of osimertinib 80 mg. Three (1.1%) patients had a dose modification due to an ocular event and 1 (0.4%) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/15445/2016

patient had a dose interruption due to an ocular event. Median time to first onset of events in the ocular effects 
grouped terms was 36.5 days (range 1 to 249 days). 
Ocular effects AEs were predominantly Grade 1 (8.8%) with Grade 2 events reported in 2.4% patients. There 
were no SAEs, no Grade ≥ 3 events, and no events of corneal erosion or corneal ulceration.  
The findings in the Phase II studies were consistent with the observations in Phase I, where no dose-related 
toxicity was observed in the ocular effects for AESI or eye disorder SOC/PT. 
In AURA Phase I: first-line capsule cohort a CTCAE Grade 3 event of corneal erosion was reported as an SAE in 
1 patient at the 80 mg dose level; this patient also had a dose interruption. The corneal erosion was attributed 
to the patient’s underlying Sjögren’s syndrome and was not considered by the investigator to be possibly 
causally related to treatment with osimertinib.  
Cardiac contractility 
A causal association between osimertinib and cardiac failure adverse events cannot be fully excluded due to the 
temporal relationship between receiving study drug and onset/recovery of events. Based on available data, 
There is no evidence of a causal relationship between osimertinib and decrease in cardiac function or cardiac 
contractility. 
Elevations AST or ALT 
Osimertinib is eliminated mainly via the liver. Evaluation for liver toxicity has shown no apparent association of 
osimertinib with drug induced liver injury. Hepatic parameters were unchanged from baseline in the majority of 
patients during treatment with osimertinib. The majority of maximum CTCAE grade shifts from baseline were 
mild (to moderate in severity.  Grade 3 changes in ALT elevations were reported for 1.2% of patients and Grade 
3 changes in AST elevations were reported for 0.2% of patients. No Hy’s Law cases were identified. 
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 
The list of ADRs has been established by the applicant taking into account the following criteria: pre-clinical 
findings, class effects, plausibility in light of the drug’s pharmacology (e.g. wild-type EGFR inhibition), incidence 
rates in light of epidemiological data in the NSCLC population (indirect comparisons to placebo data from trials 
in NSCLC patients), dose response relationship in AURA Phase I, time to onset of events and/or re-challenge 
data where available, confounding factors, the presence or absence of single events which are strongly 
indicative of a drug reaction.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
Serious adverse events were reported for a total of 20.2% (83/411) of patients in the osimertinib Phase II 
studies with no notable differences between the two studies. Respiratory disorders (7.3%) and Infections 
(6.1%) were the most common SOCs for SAE reporting. The most commonly reported SAEs were pneumonia 
and pulmonary embolism (see Table 49). 
SAEs were considered by the investigator to be possibly causally related to osimertinib in 5.1% (21/411) of 
patients. The SAEs considered by the investigator to be possibly causally related to treatment with osimertinib 
that occurred in >1 patients were pneumonitis, ILD and thrombocytopenia.

In the Phase II studies a total of 18.5% of patients had an AE that led to hospitalisation. The most common SOCs 
for AEs leading to hospitalisation were Respiratory disorders (7.1%; 29/411 patients) and Infections (5.8%; 
24/411 patients). Only the PTs of pneumonia (2.7%) and pulmonary embolism (2.4%) led to hospitalisation in 
more than 5 patients. 
Deaths 
In the osimertinib Phase II studies to date, there were 52 (12.7%) deaths reported in the 28 day follow-up 
period and post follow-up. The majority of the patients died due to the disease under investigation only. The 
most common fatal AE across the clinical programme was pneumonia.

In AURA Phase I dose expansion cohort in total, 40 deaths (40/271 patients; 14.8%) were reported by the DCO 
date of 01 May 2015. Twenty-eight (10.3%) of these deaths were considered to be related to the disease under 
investigation only. Nine (3.3%) deaths were attributed to an AE only and 3 (1.1%) patients had their death 
reported as being related to the disease under investigation and also as an AE with the outcome of death. Of the 
12 patients who died due to an AE the most frequently reported AE that led to death was pneumonia (6 
patients). No other AE that led to death was reported in more than 1 patient. None of the AEs leading to death 
were considered by the investigator to be possibly causally related to treatment with osimertinib. 
In AURA Phase I remaining cohorts, one death (3.2%) occurred in the pre-treated capsule formulation dose 
escalation cohort. In total, 2 deaths (2/12 patients; 16.7%) occurred. One death (8.3%) was considered to be 
related to the disease under investigation. One death (8.3%) was considered to be secondary to the AE of renal 
failure. The death was not considered by the investigator to be possibly causally related to treatment with 
osimertinib. 
Laboratory findings 
Hepatobiliary disorders or clinical chemistry for hepatic function  
In the phase II studies, 6.6% of patients had reports of any specific hepatobiliary AE in the Investigations SOC 
or the hepatobiliary disorder SOC and <20% of patients had abnormal hepatic biochemistry values for any 
individual parameter. Adverse events in the hepatobiliary disorders SOC were reported in 10/411 (2.4%) of 
patients, six patients (1.5%) had AEs that were mild (CTCAE Grade 1), one patient (0.2%) had an AE that was 
moderate (CTCAE Grade 2).

Two  patients  were  hospitalised  due  to  hepatic-related  AEs.  Two  patients  had  a  dose  interruption  due  to 
increased ALT and AST. One (0.2%) patient experienced a dose discontinuation due to drug-induced liver injury. 
Seven patients experienced a dose interruption due to hepatic-related AEs. 
No Hy’s law cases were identified in the AURA Phase II studies. Three patients with combined ALT or AST, and 
bilirubin were identified (patients who have ALT or AST ≥3 × ULN and total bilirubin ≥2 × ULN at any time during 
the  study,  ie,  not  necessarily  at  the  same  time,  elevations  at  any  time  during  the  study).  Each  case  has 
confounding factors.  
Adverse events reported in the AURA Phase I dose expansion cohort relevant to hepatic function were reported 
under both the hepatobiliary disorders SOC and the investigations SOC; frequencies and severities of AEs in the 
Phase I study were similar to those in the Phase II studies.  
Renal disorders or clinical chemistry for renal function 
In the phase II studies, Adverse events were reported in 27/411 patients (6.6%) under the Renal and urinary 
disorders SOC of which most events were mild in severity (5.1% of Grade 1, 1.0% of Grade 2 and 0.5% AE of 
Grade 3). One AE of renal impairment leading to a dose interruption, one Grade 3 AE of urinary incontinence and 
one SAE of Grade 3 renal failure leading to hospitalisation were reported. No discontinuations due to AEs were 
reported. For the overall patient population, there was a slight rise in median serum creatinine during treatment 
with osimertinib, with a corresponding fall in median creatinine clearance which stabilised early in the first cycle. 
Based on the Investigations SOC (renal-related), blood creatinine increased was reported in 3.2% of patients 
(grade 1 in 1.7% of the patients and grade 2 in 1.5% of the patients). One patient had an AE of blood creatinine 
increased that led to a dose interruption. One patient had a grade 1 AE of increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN). 
Adverse events reported in the AURA Phase I dose expansion cohort in the renal and urinary disorders SOC, AEs 
were  reported  in  11.8%  (32/271)  of  patients;  7.7%  (21/271)  patients  had  AEs  of  Grade  1,  2.6%  (7/271) 
patients had AEs of Grade 2. The Grade ≥3 AEs were: nephrolithiasis (grade 3: 0.4%), renal failure (grade 3: 
0.4%), chronic renal failure (Grade 4: 0.4%), chronic kidney disease (Grade 4: 0.4%), and renal failure acute 
(Grade 4: 0.4%). A dose reduction due to an AE of chronic renal failure was reported in 1 (0.4%) patient. One 
(0.4%) patient discontinued osimertinib due to an AE of renal  failure. In the pre-treated, tablet formulation 
cohort in AURA phase I study 1 death (8.3%; 1/12) was considered to be secondary to an AE of renal failure.  
Platelets, leucocytes and neutrophils 
Haematological  related  AEs  were  reported  under  the  blood  and  lymphatic  disorders  SOC  and  under  the 
investigations SOC. Grade 3 events were reported by <2% of patients per PT and there were two patients with 
Grade  4  toxicities.  There  was  one  patient  with  an  AE  of  pancytopenia,  which  was  reported  as  mild  by  the 
investigator.  The  investigator  considered  the  event  to  be  possibly  causally  related.  No  patient  discontinued 
osimertinib due to changes in haemoglobin or RBC count. 
Decreases  from  baseline  in  median  values  for  platelets,  neutrophils  and  leucocytes  were  observed  early  in 
treatment with osimertinib. Median values appear to stabilise after the initial drop with the majority of patients 
experiencing  no  change  in  CTCAE  grade,  or  a  single  grade  change.  As  would  be  expected  with  the  small 
magnitude of these changes, no clinically significant sequelae in the population have been observed.

Platelets: At a population level, a decrease in median platelet count was seen over time in early cycles which 
stabilised towards the lower limit of normal (LLN). In total 56.7% of patients had a platelet count below the LLN 
at any point during the treatment period mainly Grade 1 (41/47 patients), this includes patients who had a value 
below the LLN at baseline. Platelet count decreased was reported in 11.4%of the patients and only one SAE 
related to a decrease in platelets was reported. Thrombocytopenia was reported in 5.4% (22/411) of patients 
with the majority of patients having Grade 1 events (14/22 patients).  
Leucocytes: AEs of white blood cell count decreased were reported in a total of 7.5% of patients. Grade 1 AEs 
were reported in 1.9% of patients, CTCAE Grade 2 AEs in 4.9% of patients and CTCAE Grade 3 in 0.7% of 
patients. All were considered non serious. Two patients had dose interruptions due to an AE were reported. No 
patients who had WBC count decreased were treated for the event. AEs of leukopenia were reported in a total of 
2.9% of patients. Grade 1 AEs were reported in 0.5% patients, Grade 2 AEs in 1.7% of patients and Grade 3 in 
0.7% of patients. All were considered non serious. Two patients had dose interruptions due to AEs reported. In 
total 3 patients received granulocyte-colony stimulating factor for WBC count decrease and leucopenia. 
Neutrophils: AEs of neutrophil count decreased were reported in a total of 6.1% of patients. Grade 1 AEs were 
reported in 1.0% of patients, Grade 2 AEs in 3.4% of patients and Grade 3 in 1.5% of patients. One SAE was 
reported. There was one (0.2%) patient with a discontinuation due to changes in neutrophil count over time. AEs 
of neutropenia were reported in a total of 4.1% of patients. Grade 1 AEs were reported in 1.7% of patients, 
Grade 2 AEs in 1.9% of patients and Grade 3 in 0.5% of patients. All were considered non serious and there were 
two patients with dose interruptions and one dose reduction. No events of febrile neutropenia were reported. 
Four patients received colony-stimulating factor treatment for neutropenia in the Phase II studies whilst on 
osimertinib. 
Anaemia 
AEs of anaemia were reported for 9.7% (40/411) of patients. Three patients had SAEs of anaemia (CTCAE Grade 
2): One patient had an SAE due to hospitalisation, with a time to onset at Day 156; One patient is described in 
the platelet section; and one patient reported a CTCAE Grade 3 SAE of anaemia, starting on Day 202 which led 
to dose interruption and administration of concomitant treatment. Anaemia AEs of CTCAE Grade 1 were reported 
for 4.6% of patients (19/411 patients), with Grade 2 AEs reported for 3.6% (15/411) of patients and CTCAE 
Grade 3 AEs reported for 1.5% (6/411) of patients. A total of 7 patients had blood transfusions and 1 patient had 
Darbepoetin alfa whilst on osimertinib. Two AEs of anaemia led to dose interruption. 
Clinical chemistry laboratory values 
In the majority of patients, there were no clinically significant changes in albumin, creatinine, calcium, glucose, 
magnesium, potassium or sodium observed during treatment. A small percentage of patients developed 3-grade 
shifts in magnesium (hyper), potassium (hyper and hypo), sodium (hypo) and creatinine (hyper) in the Phase II 
studies.  
In the Phase II studies, AEs relevant to clinical biochemistry parameters were reported in no more than 3.2% of 
patients for any specific PT. The most commonly reported AEs were blood creatinine increased in 3.2% of 
patients, hypocalcaemia in 2.4% of patients and hyponatraemia in 2.2% of patients. The majority of AEs were 
Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Four patients experienced Grade 3 AEs of hyponatraemia, 2 patients experienced Grade 
3 AEs of hypokalaemia, and Grade 3 AEs of hyperglycaemia and hypocalcaemia were experienced by 1 patient 
each.

Race 
An assessment of the safety profile of osimertinib was performed for patients, split by race: White (n=148); 
Black/African American (n=4); Asian (n=246); Other (n=7). As the number of Black/African American patients 
and the number of Other patients is low, the interpretation has concentrated mainly on any differences seen 
between White and Asian patients. 
The incidence of AEs was similar across all 4 groups (all >95%). However, the frequency of AEs considered by 
the investigator to be possibly causally related to osimertinib was higher in Asian patients (89.4%) versus White 
patients (80.4%). A similar pattern was observed for Grade ≥3 AEs considered by the investigator to be possibly 
causally related to osimertinib (Asian patients 14.6%; versus White patients 7.4%). 
Serious adverse events were reported less frequently for Asian patients (15.0%) compared to White patients 
(27.7%). Serious adverse events were reported for two Black/African American patients (50.0%) and no SAEs 
were reported for ‘Other’ patients. 
Dose interruption as a result of an AE occurred at a slightly higher rate in the Asian population (20.3%) than in 
the White population (15.5%). Some differences between Asians and White patients were identified.  
Age 
An assessment of the safety profile of osimertinib was performed in patients aged <65 years (n=224), ≥65 - 
<75 years (n=133) and ≥75 years (n=54).   
The incidence of adverse events was similar across all 3 groups, however AEs of Grade≥ 3 were more frequent 
for the older populations, i.e. 27.7% of patients aged <65 years, 28.6% of patients aged ≥65 - <75 years and 
38.9% of patients aged ≥75 years experienced AEs of Grade≥ 3. 
The frequency of osimertinib dose interruption due to an AE or SAE was numerically higher in the highest age 
group; 16.5% of patients aged <65 years, 18.0% of patients aged ≥65 to <75 years and 29.6% of patients aged 
≥75 years. 
The incidence of rash, decreased appetite, constipation, platelet count decreased, upper respiratory tract 
infection and rashes and acnes (group term) was numerically higher in the highest age group.

Gender 
Overall, the safety profile of osimertinib was similar for male (n=132) and female patients (n=279). No 
meaningful differences were observed between males and females in the incidence of AEs in any category, and 
no specific AEs with a difference of ≥10% were seen. There was double the incidence of ‘upper respiratory tract 
infection’ (PT) in males compared with females (11.4% vs 5.4%). There were no other AEs (when considering 
PTs with a frequency of >10%) with a doubling incidence. 
Effect of baseline BSA 
An assessment of the safety profile of osimertinib at the AE category level was performed for patients, split by 
BSA, ie <1.73 m2 (n=267) and ≥1.73 m2 (n=137). 
The incidence of AEs was similar across both groups. Patients with a baseline BSA of ≥1.73 m2 had a numerically 
higher incidence of SAEs (22.6% vs 18.4%). 
An assessment of the safety profile was also conducted for the most common AEs (>10% frequency) at PT level 
and at grouped term level (for AESIs), split by baseline BSA. The incidence of ‘cough’ (PT) (23.4% vs 9.0%), 
‘dyspnoea’ (PT) (15.3% vs 4.1%) and ‘asthenia’ (PT) (12.4% vs 4.1%) was at least numerically double the

≥1.73 m2 group and the incidence of ‘stomatitis’ (PT) (15.7% vs 5.1%) was at least numerically double the 
<1.73 m2 group. No other notable differences between the AE profiles were observed. 
Baseline WHO performance status 
An assessment of the safety profile of osimertinib at the AE category level was performed in patients with WHO 
performance status at baseline of 0 (n=152) and ≥1 (n=259). Patients who had WHO PS ≥1 at baseline 
experienced higher frequencies of CTCAE Grade 3 or higher adverse events (32.8% vs 23.7%) and causally 
related CTCAE Grade ≥3 events (15.1% vs 5.9%). Serious adverse events (22.0% vs. 17.1%) and adverse 
events leading to dose interruptions (21.2% vs 14.5%) were also higher in patients with a WHO PS ≥1 at 
baseline.  
The most common (>10% frequency) AEs were similar across WHO PS at baseline categories. 
Comorbidity of hypertension 
Overall, the safety profile of osimertinib was similar patients with hypertension (n=145) or without hypertension 
(n=266). There was no difference in the incidence of AEs for patients with hypertension or without hypertension 
(hypertension: 99.3%; no hypertension: 96.6%). AEs of CTCAE Grade 3 or higher were more frequent for 
patients with hypertension than for patients without hypertension (33.8% vs. 27.1%); this was also true for AEs 
leading to dose modifications (28.3% vs. 15.4%).  
The most common (>10% frequency) AEs were similar for patients with hypertension or without hypertension 
at baseline. 
Treatment line (2nd-line, ≥ 3rd-line) 
In general there was no difference in the incidence of AEs for patients with 2nd-line (125/129; 96.9%) and 
3rd-line (276/282; 97.9%). However, 3rd-line patients reported more AEs with CTCAE 3 or higher (93/282; 
33%) compared to 2nd-line patients (28/129; 21.7%). This was also true for causally related CTCAE Grade 3 or 
higher (3rd-line: 43/282; 15.2%; 2nd-line: 5/129; 3.9%). Serious AEs (22.3% vs 15.5%) and AEs leading to 
dose modifications (22.0% vs 15.5%) were also higher for 3rd-line patients. 
An assessment of the safety profile was also conducted for the most common (>10% frequency) AEs both at the 
PT level and at the group term level (for AESIs) for 2nd-line and 3rd-line. Adverse events more commonly 
associated with 3rd-line treatment compared to patients in 2nd-line, with a numerical difference of 5% or more, 
were observed for pruritus (15.6% vs 10.1% of patients), vomiting (12.1% vs 3.9% of patients), and WBC 
decreased (10.3% vs 1.6% of patients). 
Analysis of the sub-group of patients outlined above has indicated no increase in safety risk in case of prior 
treatment with 2nd/3rd or later lines of TKIs. Overall, the osimertinib safety profile appears acceptable, 
irrespective of the number of priorEGFR TKIs that had been received. 
Renal function 
SAP-defined subgroup analysis was not performed for patients with renal impairment. Study exclusion criteria 
mandated that patients with creatinine >1.5 times ULN concurrent with creatinine clearance <50 ml/min were 
to be excluded from taking part. 
Hepatic function  
SAP-defined subgroup analysis was not performed for patients with hepatic impairment. Study exclusion criteria 
mandated that patients with ALT >2.5 times ULN if no demonstrable liver metastases or >5 times ULN in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/15445/2016 
Page 112/134 
  
  
 
presence of liver metastases, or, AST >2.5 times ULN if no demonstrable liver metastases or >5 times ULN in 
the presence of liver metastases, or, Total bilirubin >1.5 times ULN if no liver metastases or >3 times ULN in the 
presence of documented Gilbert’s syndrome or liver metastases, were to be excluded from taking part. 
Effect of smoking status 
An assessment of the safety profile of osimertinib at the AE category level was performed for patients smoking 
status split by Ever (n=117) and Never (n=294). 
Overall there was no notable difference between the ever and never smoking statuses. 
An assessment of the safety profile was also conducted for the most common AEs (>10% frequency) at PT level 
and at grouped term level (for AESIs), split by smoking status. No notable difference between the AE profile was 
observed. Adverse events with a numerical difference of 5% or more were observed for nausea (11.1% vs 
19.0%), platelet count decreased (19.7% vs 8.2%), dry skin (grouped term) (35.0% vs 29.3%) and rashes and 
acnes (grouped term) (45.3% vs 39.8%) for Ever versus Never smokers respectively. 
Since osimertinib PK exposure is unaffected by smoking status, it is unlikely that smoking status would impact 
the safety profile of osimertinib. The small numerical differences in the AEs leading to dose modifications for 
ever smokers vs. Never smokers that are seen are most likely an artefact of natural variability. Overall, 
irrespective of smoking status osimertinib is a tolerable treatment for ever smokers and neversmokers. 
The overall PK and safety data, also does not suggest a relationship between being a smoker and an impact of 
osimertinib on the safety profile. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
An analysis of relevant AEs in the Phase II studies was conducted, focusing on patients concomitantly using a 
statin. In total, 47 patients were on a statin and 364 patients had no statin use. No notable differences between 
the profiles were observed. 
In the pivotal Phase II clinical trials, 67.9% (279/411) of patients recruited were female with a median age of 63 
years old (mean 61.9 years). The age of the recruited population of female patients is broadly characteristic of 
a NSCLC population and represents a group of patients where the use of contraceptives is likely to be minimal. 
Based on the pharmacokinetic characteristics of osimertinib, it is the Applicant’s position that the exposure of 
osimertinib is unlikely to be affected by previous contraceptive treatments and thereby, the safety and/or 
efficacy of osimertinib in these patients is not expected to be any different compared to others who have not 
used contraceptives. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Adverse events leading to discontinuation 
The frequency of adverse events leading to discontinuation was low across the osimertinib pooled Phase II 
studies (5.6%; 23/411). The common AEs that characterise the osimertinib safety profile (diarrhoea, rash) did 
not generally lead to discontinuation of treatment. 
Across the Phase II studies, the reported discontinuations due to AEs in ≥2 patients were ILD and pneumonitis 
(each  reported  in  5  patients;  1.2%),  and  cerebrovascular  accident  (CVA)  and  pulmonary  embolism  (each 
reported in 2 patients; 0.5%). Nineteen events leading to discontinuations in 15 patients were considered by the 
investigator  to  be  possibly  causally  related  to  treatment  with  osimertinib.  For  ILD  or  ILD-like  events  it  was 
mandated in the study protocols that the patients discontinue. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/15445/2016 
Page 113/134 
  
  
 
The low rate of discontinuation from osimertinib 80 mg therapy in both the Phase II studies and the AURA Phase 
I  study  indicates  osimertinib  at  the  recommended  daily  dose  is  tolerated  by  this  advanced  NSCLC  patient 
population. 
In study the dose expansion cohort of the AURA Phase I, in total, 10.0% (27/271) of patients across all doses of 
osimertinib  discontinued  due  to  an  AE.  4/271  patients;  1.5%)  and  pneumonia  (3/71  patients;  1.1%).  The 
events of pneumonitis were all reported for patients at the 160 mg dose level. No single PT drove the incidence 
of AEs leading to discontinuation of osimertinib. osimertinib was discontinued due to AEs that were considered 
by the investigator to be possibly causally related to treatment with osimertinib in 3.3% (9/271) of patients. An 
increase  in  the  incidence  of  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  osimertinib  that  were  considered  by  the 
investigator to be possibly causally related to treatment with osimertinib was apparent from 80 mg to 160 mg 
(1/97 patient; 1.0% and 7/93 patients; 7.5%, respectively). At the 80 mg dose level 8.2% (8/97) of patients 
discontinued due to an AE. No individual PT leading to discontinuation was reported for more than one patient. 
The  PTs  of  pulmonary  embolism,  AST  increased,  intestinal  obstruction,  atrial  fibrillation,  pneumonitis,  renal 
failure and cardiac failure acute were considered by the investigator to be possibly causally related to treatment 
with osimertinib. 
Dose reductions due to adverse events 
Adverse events leading to a dose reduction of osimertinib to 40 mg occurred in 18 patients (4.4%) in the Phase 
II studies suggesting good tolerability of osimertinib. 
In 14 patients with dose reductions due to AEs, there was no evidence of any single type of toxicity driving the 
dose reductions. Fourteen PTs leading to dose reduction were reported for these 14 patients, with some patients 
having more than one AE reported. The PT of electrocardiogram QT prolonged was reported for 3 patients and 
the  PT  of  nausea  was  reported  for  2  patients,  all  other  PTs  were  reported  for  only  one  patient  each.  Four 
additional patients with dose reductions due to AEs were recorded on the exposure CRF and not linked to a 
particular AE on the AE CRF. 
In  the  Phase  II  clinical  trials  with  osimertinib,  patients  who  had  a  dose  reduction  to  40  mg  were  rarely 
discontinued at a later time point due to an AE. Of the 18 (4.4%) patients who had a dose reduction to 40 mg 
osimertinib,  16  patients  (3.9%)  continued  treatment  with  osimertinib.  Two  patients  (0.5%)  subsequently 
discontinued osimertinib due to an AE: one due to rash maculo-papular; one due to drug induced liver injury.  
Adverse  events  that  led  to  a  dose  reduction  were  reported  in  10.7%  (29/271)  of  pre-treated  patients  who 
received the osimertinib capsule formulation. 
The main reasons for dose reductions were related to the SOCs of GI disorders (8/271 patients; 3.0%), 
infections (7/271 patients; 2.6%), skin effects (6/271 patients; 2.2%) and investigations (5/271 patients; 
1.8%). The most commonly reported PTs were diarrhoea (5/271 patients; 1.8%), paronychia (4/271 patients; 
1.5%) and nausea (3/271 patients; 1.1%). With the exception of dizziness and chronic renal failure (1 patient 
each at the 40 mg dose level) and blood creatine phosphokinase increased (1 patient at the 80 mg dose level), 
AEs that led to a dose reduction were only reported at the 160 mg and 240 mg dose levels, suggesting a 
relationship of dose reductions with dose. 
Dose interruptions due to adverse events 
AEs led to dose interruptions in 18.7% (77/411) of patients in the Phase II studies, with a total of 115 dose 
interruptions in 77 patients. In the majority of the 115 events, only 1 PT contributed to the dose interruption per 
Assessment report

event (84.3%; 97/115), with a maximum of 3 PTs contributing to a dose interruption for one event. This 
observation further supports the tolerability of osimertinib at 80 mg. 
The most common SOCs with AEs leading to dose interruptions were Investigations (5.8%; 24/411) and 
Infections (4.4%; 18/411). The most common PTs leading to dose interruptions were electrocardiogram QT 
prolonged (8/411; 1.9%), neutrophil count decreased (6/411; 1.5%), and ALT increased (5/411; 1.2%). All 
other PTs were reported in no more than 4 patients each. 
Of the 77 patients who had a temporary interruption for an AE, subsequent dose reduction or dose 
discontinuation was infrequent. A total of 56/77 (72.7%) patients continued osimertinib at the same dose with 
no dose reduction or discontinuation due to an AE and 17/41 (41.5%) patients were dose reduced. Six patients 
later discontinued due to an AE (two of whom, also had a dose reduction after previous dose interruptions due 
to AE). 
In AURA Phase I dose expansion cohort the Dose interruptions due to AEs were reported in 22.9% (62/271) of 
pre-treated patients who received the osimertinib capsule formulation in the dose expansion part of the study. 
The reasons driving dose interruptions were distributed across different SOCs. The major reasons were related 
to the SOCs of GI disorders (16/271 patients; 5.9%), investigations(13/271 patients; 4.8%), and infections 
(12/271 patients; 4.4%). The most commonly reported PTs were diarrhoea (6/271 patients; 2.2%), pulmonary 
embolism (5/271 patients; 1.8%), paronychia (5/271 patients; 1.8%), neutrophil count decreased (4/271 
patients; 1.5%), and ALT increased, nausea and vomiting (each reported 3/271 patients; 1.1%).Generally, 
there was no clear association with the incidence of AEs leading to dose interruption and osimertinib dose level. 
Post marketing experience 
There is no post-marketing data available for osimertinib 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  established  safety/tolerability  profile  of  approved  small  molecule  EGFR  TKI  agents  (gefitinib,  erlotinib, 
afatinib), derived from clinical experience, consists mostly of gastrointestinal disturbances (diarrhoea, nausea 
and vomiting) and skin reactions (rash, acne, dry skin and pruritus, and rarely, severe bullous and exfoliative 
reactions). The aetiology of these events is thought to be related to inhibition of non-mutated EGFR by these 
agents in target tissues. These events are well characterised and are considered to be mostly mild or moderate 
in severity and reversible with supportive care or a short cessation of therapy. Typical onset is within the first 
month of treatment and there is considered to be a dose relationship. 
Other types of adverse event (AE) reported commonly or very commonly with these agents in patients with 
advanced NSCLC include anorexia, stomatitis, asthenia, keratitis, conjunctivitis and alopecia.  
Less common toxicities that have been associated with EGFR TKIs include Interstitial lung disease (ILD); the 
frequency of ILD documented in this patient population is 1.3% with gefitinib and between <1/100 and ≥1/1000 
(i.e. 0.1-1.0%) with erlotinib, including fatalities. From the currently approved SmPC for afatinib, it is stated 
that ILD-like AEs are reported in 0.7% amongst more than 3800 patients. Furthermore, gefitinib, erlotinib and 
afatinib  have  all  been  associated  with  hepatotoxicity  (Spraggs  et  al  2013).  EGFR  TKI  agents  have  also 
demonstrated  an  increase  in  embryolethality  and  abortion  in  non-clinical  reproductive  toxicity  studies.  The 
applicant claims that the non-clinical toxicology profile of osimertinib largely reflects the pharmacological action 
of this compound, and is generally consistent with that reported for other EGFR TKIs such as erlotinib, gefitinib 
and afatinib.

The safety evaluation is mainly based on data from two phase II studies, AURA extension (N=201) and AURA2 
(N=210), including a total of 411 patients.  
Due to the single arm design of the studies submitted, lack of control arm hampers the (direct) comparison to 
other treatment regimens. 
The median exposure for patients in the two Phase II studies (411 patients), 7.7 months with 236 (57.4%) of 
the patients received osimertinib for longer than 6 months. In AURA Phase I study population the median 
exposure to osimertinib is 8.2 months and 102 (50.7%) patients received osimertinib for longer than 6 months.  
In summary, in the pooled analysis of the Phase II studies, AEs were reported for almost all, in 97.6% of patients 
in the study; casually related to osimertinib in 86.4% of the patients. Most adverse reactions were Grade 1 or 2 
in severity.  
Common AEs: For the pooled phase II studies, AEs were most frequently reported in the SOCs of GI disorders 
(69.8%), Skin disorders (64.2%), and Infections (51.6%). The most common PTs were diarrhoea (42.3%), rash 
(23.8%), dry skin (23.1%) and paronychia (17.5%) 
Fatal AEs were reported for 3.2% (13/411) of patients, 4 of which were considered by the investigator to be 
possibly causally related to osimertinib. The most common fatal AE across the clinical program was pneumonia, 
which is not unexpected in an advanced NSCLC population.  
Serious adverse events were reported in 20.2% (83/411) of patients; 5.1% (21/411) of patients had an SAE 
considered by the investigator to be possibly causally related to osimertinib. In general, the SAEs reported are 
commonly reported in patients with advanced lung cancer and are not unexpected. 
Dose interruptions due to AEs were reported for 18.7% of patients, dose reductions due to AEs were reported for 
3.4% of patients, and discontinuations due to AEs were reported for 5.6% of patients. Dose reductions due to 
ADRs occurred in 2.2% of the patients. Discontinuation due to adverse reactions or abnormal laboratory 
parameters was 3.2%. 
The most common reasons for permanent discontinuation of treatment are related to the respiratory system, 
being pneumonitis and pneumonia, which is not unexpected in this patient population. 
AESI: The adverse events of special interest (AESI) topics includes skin effects, diarrhoea, upper GI 
inflammation, stomatitis, Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) or ILD-like effects, nail effects, ocular effects, and 
cardiac effects (including QT prolongation and cardiac contractility) as well as other safety topics (hepatobiliary 
disorders, renal disorders, upper GI tract effects including stomatitis). 
Severe, life-threatening or fatal Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) or ILD-like adverse reactions (e.g. pneumonitis) 
have been observed in patients treated with osimertinib in clinical studies. Most cases improved or resolved with 
interruption of treatment. Patients with a past medical history of ILD, drug induced ILD, radiation pneumonitis 
that required steroid treatment, or any evidence of clinically active ILD were excluded from clinical studies. 
Careful assessment of all patients with an acute onset and/or unexplained worsening of pulmonary symptoms 
(dyspnoea, cough, fever) should be performed to exclude ILD. Treatment with this medicinal product should be 
interrupted pending investigation of these symptoms. If ILD is diagnosed, osimertinib should be permanently 
discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated as necessary (see sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
The development of ILD is a potential risk associated with advanced NSCLC and treatments used for NSCLC, 
including chemotherapy and EGFR TKIs. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is considered an important identified risk 
for osimertinib based on the nature of the signal and number of reported events.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/15445/2016 
Page 116/134 
  
  
 
The risk of developing ILD in Japanese Asian patients appears higher than for patients of non-Asian ethnicity in 
the rest of world. The reason for this observed difference is currently not known. Despite the low number of ILD 
events, the data suggest as a risk factor belonging to the Asian ethnic group. 
No clear risk factors have been identified in the ongoing investigations into ILD events reported across the 
osimertinib program. 
The frequency reported should be considered in the context of the underlying disease and previous cancer 
therapies received by trial participants. NSCLC and its treatment are factors which are known to pre-dispose 
patients to occurrence of ILD. The incidence of ILD with EGFR TKIs is variable, reported in up to 5.7% of treated 
patients, with severe ILD reported in up to 2.6% of treated patients. Rates of acute ILD events up to and 
exceeding10% have been reported in patients receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In many cases for 
currently approved EGFR TKIs, ILD can be fatal, with more than 30% of ILD events with a fatal outcome 
reported in some studies (Shi et al, 2014). Based on the limited available data on irreversible EGFR inhibitors, 
there is no evidence of an increased level of risk associated with irreversible inhibition of EGFR inhibitors. 
Afatinib reports a 1.5% incidence rate of ILD, with a 0.4% fatality rate, which is in line with other EGFR inhibitors 
(afatinib USPI). 
Time to onset of ILD with EGFR-TKIs is often very rapid with a risk of ILD with gefitinib mainly in the first 4 weeks 
of treatment, whereas with osimertinib the majority of ILD reports were between 4 and 12 weeks (median time 
to onset 83 days; range 17 days to 230 days across the osimertinib program). 
The AURA2 study included an intensive assessment  of electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, addressing key 
aspects of a conventional thorough QT/QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) study, including time-matched 
ECG assessments. 
QTc interval prolongation occurs in patients treated with osimertinib. QTc interval prolongation may lead to an 
increased risk for ventricular tachyarrhythmias (e.g. torsade de pointes) or sudden death. No arrhythmic events 
were reported in AURAex or AURA2. Patients with clinically important abnormalities in rhythm and conduction as 
measured by resting electrocardiogram (ECG) (e.g. QTc interval greater than 470 ms) were excluded from these 
studies (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
When possible, the use of osimertinib in patients with congenital long QT syndrome should be avoided. Periodic 
monitoring with electrocardiograms (ECGs) and electrolytes should be conducted in patients with congestive 
heart failure, electrolyte abnormalities, or those who are taking medicinal products that are known to prolong 
the QTc interval. Treatment should be withheld in patients who develop a QTc interval greater than 500 msec on 
at least 2 separate ECGs until the QTc interval is less than 481 msec or recovery to baseline if the QTc interval 
is  greater  than  or  equal  to  481  msec,  then  resume  osimertinib  at  a  reduced  dose  as  described  in  Table  1. 
Osimertinib  should  be  permanently  discontinued  in  patients  who  develop  QTc  interval  prolongation  in 
combination  with  any  of  the  following:  Torsade  de  pointes,  polymorphic  ventricular  tachycardia, 
signs/symptoms of serious arrhythmia (see sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
It is acknowledged that no evidence of any clinical consequences of QT prolongation has been observed in 
clinical studies to date, hence, a contraindication is not warranted. However, the risk for such events are at 
present unknown, and the proposed product information (PI) from the company will hopefully facilitate an 
informed decision regarding the administration of osimertinib to patients that may be at higher risk of QTc 
interval prolongation and provide appropriate guidance regarding any modification to treatment that might be 
needed should an event of QTc interval prolongation occur. No safety signal with regards to cardiac events was 
observed, other than the already described drug-related QTc interval prolongation. QT prolongation is classified 
Assessment report

Page 117/134 
  
  
 
as an important identified risk in the proposed RMP. 
Cardiac contractility: A causal association between osimertinib and cardiac failure adverse events cannot be fully 
excluded due to the temporal relationship between receiving study drug and onset/recovery of events. Based on 
available data, osimertinib has no detrimental effect upon cardiac contractility.  
Diarrhoea was the most commonly reported AE across the osimertinib Phase II studies and Phase I study. 
The severity of diarrhoea seen in clinical trials reflects the margin of selectivity against wild-type EGFR displayed 
by osimertinib when compared to other EGFR TKIs. In particular severe events such as haemorrhagic diarrhoea 
or GI perforation have not been seen. 
At the event level, the diarrhoea experienced during treatment with osimertinib has not required dose reduction, 
and has rarely led to dose interruption, or permanent discontinuation. Less than half of all events of diarrhoea 
received treatment and irrespective of whether treatment had been received, were reported to have resolved.  
Events were typically of low clinical significance with no requirement for medical intervention to prevent the 
development of complications such as dehydration or electrolyte disturbance. 
In the pooled phase II studies, skin effect grouped term AEs were reported in 59.9% of patients, Rash (23.8%) 
and dry skin (23.1) were the most common skin effect PTs in the skin effects grouped terms. 
There were no SAEs .No skin-related AE led to hospitalisation. Across the studies there were no severe bullous, 
severe blistering, or severe exfoliative rash events, no events suggestive of hypersensitivity reactions, including 
SJS or TEN (Lyell’s syndrome), and no events of phototoxicity.  
The company claims that the low severity of the safety profile of skin effects seen in the osimertinib clinical trials 
reflects the margin of selectivity against wild-type EGFR displayed by osimertinib when compared to other EGF 
TKIs, however, these severe events are reported as rare with treatment of other TKIs and it may not have been 
possible to detect them at this stage. Based on current knowledge, skin effects seem to be very frequently 
occurring, but manageable and seldom require dose reduction or discontinuation, and hence, do not seem to 
significantly contribute to the tolerability burden in this advanced NSCLC population.  
Events in any of the ocular effects grouped terms were reported in a total of 11.2% of patients with a similar 
distribution between both Phase II studies. The most common PTs reported in the Ocular effects grouped terms 
were dry eye in 5.6% (23/411) of patients and conjunctivitis in 2.9% (12/411) of patients. No other PT was 
reported at a frequency ≥2%. There were no SAEs, no events of CTCAE Grade 3 or greater and no events of 
corneal erosion or corneal ulceration. Twenty-six patients (6.3%) with ocular effects AEs received treatment, 
but no ocular effects AEs led to permanent discontinuation of osimertinib 80 mg. 
With regards to renal disorders or clinical chemistry for renal function the data shows a slight rise in serum 
median creatinine (and corresponding fall in median creatinine clearance) which stabilises within the first cycle. 
Less than 5% of patients reported renal AEs across the Phase II studies, most of which were mild in severity.  
Decreases  from  baseline  in  median  values  for  platelets,  neutrophils  and  leucocytes  were  observed  early  in 
treatment with osimertinib. Median values appear to stabilise after the initial drop with the majority of patients 
experiencing  no  change  in  CTCAE  grade,  or  a  single  grade  change.  As  would  be  expected  with  the  small 
magnitude of these changes, no clinically significant sequelae in the population have been observed. 
CTCAE grade changes from baseline were observed in other haematological (e.g. haemoglobin, lymphocytes) 
and biochemical parameters (e.g. creatinine, sodium, potassium, magnesium), but no pattern in time to onset 
Assessment report

or clinical course of events was identified. These changes in laboratory parameters have not been identified as 
adverse  drug  reactions  (ADRs)  associated  with  osimertinib  and  were  not  considered  to  be  of  clinical 
consequence. 
Osimertinib is eliminated mainly via the liver. A small number of patients reported AEs of elevations in AST 
(6.3%) or ALT (6.6%) and the majority of these elevations were Grade 1 or Grade 2 changes. Grade 3 changes 
in ALT elevations were reported for 1.2% of patients and Grade 3 changes in AST elevations were reported for 
0.2% of patients. No Hy’s Law cases were identified however the patient population is too limited at the time (3 
cases were considered but finally not lead to a definitive conclusion). 
The overall assessment did not identify an increased risk of drug-induced liver injury (DILI). 
Any differences seen between different ethnicities were thought not to be of clinical significance. The difference 
observed in SAE incidence (higher in Whites) and AE incidence (higher in Asians) is reflective of variability in 
data with no relationship with the product. 
The safety profile for osimertinib is broadly similar across age groups in terms of nature, severity and impact of 
adverse events. However as expected among the elderly (≥65 years) the incidences were numerically higher for 
at least some AEs and also (S)AEs that led to dose modifications (interruptions or reductions) as compared to 
the younger (23 % versus 17 %). Older patients experienced more Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions 
compared to younger patients (32% versus 28%). No overall differences in efficacy were observed between 
these subjects and younger subjects. No dosage adjustment is required due to patient age, body weight, 
gender, ethnicity and smoking status. 
In phase I/II clinical trials a limited number of patients were treated with osimertinib daily doses of up to 240 mg 
without dose limiting toxicities. In these studies, patients who were treated with osimertinib daily doses of 
160 mg and 240 mg experienced an increase in the frequency and severity of a number of typical EGFR-induced 
AEs (primarily diarrhoea and skin rash) compared to the 80 mg dose. There is limited experience with accidental 
overdoses in humans. All cases were isolated incidents of patients taking an additional daily dose of osimertinib 
in error, without any resulting clinical consequences. 
There is no specific treatment in the event of osimertinib overdose. In case of suspected overdose, osimertinib 
should be withheld and symptomatic treatment initiated. 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of osimertinib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity (embryolethality, reduced foetal growth, and neonatal death. Based on its 
mechanism of action and preclinical data, osimertinib may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant 
woman. Osimertinib should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires 
treatment with osimertinib. In addition, women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming 
pregnant while receiving osimertinib. It is not known whether osimertinib or its metabolites are excreted in 
human milk. There is insufficient information on the excretion of osimertinib or its metabolites in animal milk. 
However, osimertinib and its metabolites were detected in the suckling pups and there were adverse effects on 
pup growth and survival. A risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued 
during treatment with osimertinib. There are no data on the effect of osimertinib on human fertility. Results from 
animal studies have shown that osimertinib has effects on male and female reproductive organs and could 
impair fertility (see sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC). 
Osimertinib has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines (see section 4.7 of the SmPC).

Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
The phase III study AURA3 comparing osimertinib to platinum-based doublet chemotherapy will provide 
additional data to confirm the safety profile of osimertinib in the treatment of patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the osimertinib safety profile was as expected for a population of patients with advanced NSCLC treated 
with an EGFR TKI agent with an improved margin of selectivity against wild-type EGFR. The most commonly 
reported AEs being low-grade gastrointestinal disturbances (primarily diarrhoea) and skin effects (mainly rash, 
acne,  and  dry  skin)  which  are  consistent  with  some  degree  of  inhibition  of  wild-type  EGFR.A  total  of  2.9% 
(35/1221) patients have reported ILD or suspected ILD-like events 
Adverse  events  of  maximum  CTCAE  Grades  3,  4  and  5  have  been  experienced  in  25.5%  (105/411)    1.2% 
(5/411) and 2.7% (11/411) of patients, respectively. Serious adverse events were reported in 20.2% (83/411) 
of patients; 5.1% (21/411) of patients had an SAE considered by the investigator to be possibly causally related 
to  osimertinib.  Fatal  AEs  were  reported  for  3.2%  (13/411)  of  patients,  4  of  which  were  considered  by  the 
investigator to be possibly causally related to osimertinib. 
The lack of comparator in the studies hampers to properly contextualise the tolerability and toxicity. The long 
term safety profile is not totally known. Nevertheless, despite these uncertainties, the overall safety profile of 
osimertinib is considered acceptable and manageable, with a likely better tolerability than the traditional 
chemotherapy 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the context of a 
conditional MA 
In order to confirm the safety profile of osimertinib in the treatment of patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive the applicant should submit the final results of the phase III study 
AURA3 comparing osimertinib to platinum-based doublet chemotherapy by 30 June 2017.

2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, osimertinib is included in the additional monitoring 
list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product 
authorised in the EU and it is approved under a conditional marketing authorisation [REG Art 14(7)].  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Pooled results from the two phase II studies have shown that the administration of 80 mg of osimertinib in the 
treatment of EGFR T790M mutation positive advanced NSCLC patients who had progressed following prior 
therapy with an EGFR TKI, lead to an objective response rate by BICR of around 66%. The ORR was similar 
between 2nd and 3rd-line cohorts in both phase II studies. All the responses were partials in the AURA 
extension, whereas two patients had complete response in the AURA 2 study. Results according to the 
assessment of the investigators were similar to those obtained by the BICR. The analysis of subgroups shows 
similar results among the different populations studied. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/15445/2016 
Page 127/134 
 
 
  
  
 
The median duration of the response according to the BICR has not been achieved yet (95% CI 8.3-NC). 
However, data from investigator assessment provide a median of DoR of 8.5 months, with 96.2% of responders 
showing a documented objective response at their second scheduled follow-up scan (Week 12 ± 1 week; 
according BICR). The other secondary variables, support the efficacy of osimertinib in this population: tumour 
shrinkage in approximately 94% of patients and a proportion of patients estimated to be alive and progression 
free around 71% and 52% at 6 and 9 months, respectively. 
These results are also supported by those obtained in the AURA phase I study, where in the subset of 37 patients 
in the 80 mg cohort (ORR 61.7% 95%CI 48.2-73.9) the median DoR from first documentation of objective 
response by Kaplan-Meier method, based on BICR data, was 9.7 months (95% CI: 8.3, NC). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
The design of the studies could be considered the most important uncertainty, as there was no control group, 
which makes it difficult to drawn firm conclusions on the added benefit from treatment. .  
Despite ORR is a commonly used endpoint in oncology studies, its use is usually limited to exploratory studies  
since it is not able to reliably estimate the ultimate benefit for patients in terms of life expectancy. Furthermore, 
data in terms of PFS and OS are too immature to reflect the real benefit of osimertinib. 
Even though ORR results seem promising and outstanding, duration of the response has not yet been totally 
estimated in the main studies supporting this application. Moreover, it is very likely that mechanisms of 
resistance are developed by the tumour, decreasing the activity of osimertinib and leading to the failure of 
treatment. Some of these resistances have already been described (Ann Oncol. 2015 Aug 12; Thress et al., 
Nature Medicine, 2015). 
The subgroup analyses of ORR by demographics and disease characteristics reveal differences in ORRs between 
patients that possess different EGFR mutations (69.6% in patients with Exon 19 deletion versus 58.9% in 
patients with L858R mutation), and also between patients of Asian (70.0%) and non-Asian ethnicity (60.2%). 
There are no data in patients harbouring the T790 mutation in the absence of previous exposure to TKIs. 
Theoretically, osimertinib is expected to be as effective in first as well as in 2nd line in the presence of T790M. 
From a mechanistic point of view, the expected benefit from treatment with osimertinib should not be related to 
previous treatment. Furthermore, dedicated studies are hardly feasible since the prevalence of the mutation in 
patients naïve to EGFR TKIs is estimated to be around 1%. An ongoing study will explore the efficacy of 
osimertinib in first line, including patients with the presence of the T790M mutation. Nevertheless, given the low 
prevalence of the mutation in patients not previously exposed to TKIs the evidence that will be generated is 
expected to be limited (osimertinib versus TKI Inhibitors as First-Line Treatment in Patients with EGFR Mutation 
Positive). 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
According to the data from the phase II studies, the administration of osimertinib is mainly characterised by the 
following AEs: diarrhoea (42.3%), rash (23.8%), dry skin (23.1%) and paronychia (17.5%).  
Adverse events Grade ≥3 were reported for 29.4% (121/411) patients. Of them 1.2% (5/411) were grade 4. 
Around 11.7% (48/411) of patients had an AE Grade ≥ 3 considered by the investigator to be possibly causally 
related to osimertinib. The most frequent AEs grade ≥ 3 were pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, dyspnoea and 
neutrophil count decreased., alanine aminotransferase increased. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/15445/2016 
Page 128/134 
  
  
 
In the osimertinib Phase II studies to date, most deaths were considered to be due to the underlying disease 
only (39 of the 52 deaths).  The most common fatal AE across the clinical programme was pneumonia. In the 
phase II studies, Fatal AEs were reported for 3.2% (13/411) of patients, 4 of which were considered by the 
investigator to be possibly causally related to osimertinib (3 patients had AEs of ILD, and 1 patient had an AE of 
pneumonitis). 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 20.2% (83/411) patients; 5.1% (21/411) of patients had an 
SAE considered by the investigator to be possibly causally related to osimertinib. 
Among the AEs of special interest, it should be noted the ILD/pneumonitis and the QT Interval Prolongation. The 
former was reported in 2.9% and was fatal in 0.3% of the 1221 patients who received osimertinib across clinical 
trials. Regarding the QT interval prolongation, of the 411 patients in AURAex and AURA2, one patient (less than 
1%) was found to have a QTc greater than 500 msec, and 11 patients (2.7%) had an increase from baseline QTc 
greater than 60 msec. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The size of the safety database and the few data in the long run, are the most important uncertainties related to 
toxicity and tolerability of this drug. Again the lack of comparator hampers to contextualise the actual safety 
profile. 
In fact, severe skin reactions, diarrhoea, ocular toxicity and hepatotoxicity have been reported for similar TKI 
medicinal products and although few severe cases were seen with AZD, the limitations of the safety database 
may well explain it. So, at the present time these are considered relevant potential safety concerns.  
Relevant potential DDI interactions should be considered missing information for prescribing physician until 
further clinical data become available 
Considering that the median age at diagnosis for NSCL is around 70 years, available data in very elderly patients 
(>75 years old) is limited and considered relevant missing information. 
Osimertinib was shown to undergo significant metabolism mediated clearance presumably with the liver as a 
major site of biotransformation and hence, hepatic impairment might be expected to lead to increased exposure 
of osimertinib. A clinical study investigating the impact of mild and moderate hepatic impairment (as assessed 
by Child-Pugh criteria) on osimertinib pharmacokinetics is currently ongoing. 
Unfortunately, no clear risk factors have been identified in the ongoing investigations into ILD events reported 
across the osimertinib program, except the general knowledge that a previous history of ILD is a significant risk 
factor for the development of a subsequent episode. Japanese patients experienced a higher incidence of ILD in 
the clinical studies with osimertinib compared to non-Japanese [the incidence of ILD was 3.5% in patients of 
Asian ethnicity (2.3% in Japanese patients) and 2.0% in patients of non-Asian ethnicity]. The reason for this 
observed difference is currently not known. Published data have noted that ILD is more common in Asia than the 
rest of the world, although reports are inconsistent.  
As patients with clinically important cardiac abnormalities in rhythm and conduction were excluded from the 
AURA studies, it is not certain what effect osimertinib will have in these patients with baseline risk factors. 
Therefore, the careful selection and close monitoring of patients may avert the development of QT prolongation.

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The historical ORR obtained by chemotherapy, or TKI re-challenge, are considerably lower than those seen in 
the AURA studies. Even assuming that the response rate could be overestimated and in the worst-case scenario 
of a response rate 50 % and DoR of 6 months (lower 95%CI for AURA extension study is 54.2%). Thus, tumour 
responses associated to osimertinib treatment are expected to be superior to the different alternatives usually 
offered to patients T790M+, which is expected to be translated into benefit in terms of relevant endpoint, 
although of uncertain magnitude. 
Despite the lack of long term data on the duration of responses, data from investigator assessment give a 
median of DoR of 8.5 months.  
Regarding the safety profile, the majority of the AEs identified in the safety database were mostly mild 
(maximum AEs Grade 1– diarrhoea 35.8%, rash 21.7%, dry skin 21.4%, paronychia 12.7%) to moderate 
(maximum AEs Grade 2 – diarrhoea 5.1%, rash 2.2%, dry skin 1.7%, paronychia 4.9%) in severity. Grade ≥3 
AEs for the PTs above were reported only for the PT of diarrhoea (1.0%), no AEs Grade 3 AEs were reported for 
the PTs of rash, dry skin or paronychia. The percentages of severe AEs and deaths are not deemed too high if we 
consider the context of the disease and the usually associated to chemotherapy. Even comparing osimertinib 
with other TKIs and the class-effects related to those like skin-effect, diarrhoea, upper GI inflammatory adverse 
events, nail and ocular effects, osimertinib appears to have an improved margin of selectivity against wild-type 
EGFR 
Despite the limited database, available data are partially in line with the already known safety profile for this 
class of medicinal products and considered overall acceptable in the current context.

Despite the remaining uncertainties on the true magnitude of the benefit, the observed benefits are considered 
to outweigh the expected risks associated with osimertinib treatment in the initially claimed: “the treatment of 
adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M 
mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed on or after EGFR TKI therapy”.  
Furthermore, it is noted that T790M may be present in a small subset of patients not previously exposed to TKIs, 
i.e. first line. For these patients, neither chemotherapy nor available TKIs constitute optimal treatment 
alternatives. By contrary, similar rates of response as in 2nd line would be expected with osimertinib and thus, 
this could be a suitable treatment option for those patients with metastatic EGRF T790 mutation-positive NSCLC 
not previously exposed to EGFR TKIs. Therefore, benefits are considered to outweigh risks also in this small 
subset of patients. 
Data available are not considered sufficiently comprehensive to grant a full marketing authorization however 
they are of sufficient relevance in the context of a life-threatening disease where an unmet medical need exists. 
Therefore, a conditional approval is supported subject to presentation submission of comprehensive data within 
reasonable timelines. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
A conditional approval has been applied, besides an accelerated assessment. The latter was adopted on May 
2015. Regarding the former, the CHMP is of the opinion  that, although comprehensive clinical data referring to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/15445/2016

the safety and efficacy of the medicinal product have not been supplied, all the following requirements for a 
conditional marketing are met: 
the risk-benefit balance of the medicinal product, as defined in Article 1(28a) of Directive 2001/83/EC, 
• 
is positive; 
The benefit risk balance is considered positive by the CHMP. Osimertinib has shown an outstanding and very 
promising ORR, which appears long-lasting and thus, deemed of clinical value. This tumour response appears 
quite superior to that seen with any of the available treatment options in the current context, where those are 
limited.  Despite the limitations of the evidence provided, it is noted that results have been replicated in two 
phase II clinical studies besides a phase I study. In addition, the antitumour effect was associated with some 
improvement in tumour related symptoms and is expected to translate into a gain in PFS and eventually in OS. 
However, it is recognised that a reliable estimation of the benefits in terms of PFS and/or survival cannot be done 
at the present time.  
In addition to that, the tolerability of this new treatment seems to be adequate and manageable, with a 
frequency of AEs leading to discontinuation and dose modification of around 5.6% and 20% respectively, which 
is clearly lower than those reported for the chemotherapy. 
• 
it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the comprehensive clinical data; 
It seems likely that the applicant can provide comprehensive clinical data from the AURA3 study, since full 
enrolment is projected to be completed within the third quarter (Q3) of 2015 and completion is expected in a 
reasonable timeframe i.e. 30 June 2017. 
• 
unmet medical needs will be fulfilled; 
There is currently an unmet medical need for more active treatments in those patients with NSCLC harbouring 
the T790M mutation. Osimertinib has shown promising ORR in these patients that has not been observed with 
currently available therapies. 
the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product 
• 
concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required 
In this context, taking into account the poor prognosis of these patients, the substantial increment in tumour 
responses and expected DoR over available treatment options, as well as the consistency in ORRs among the 
studies submitted, a benefit in terms of clinical outcomes can be reasonably expected subject to presentation of 
comprehensive efficacy and safety clinical data within reasonable timelines (the results from the phase III trial 
AURA3 will be submitted by 30 June 2017). 
Thus on the basis of the above criteria being met, a conditional approval can be supported. 
In conclusion, “TAGRISSO is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
EGRF T790 mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).”

Adjuvanted  Quadrivalent  Influenza  Vaccine  (aQIV;  Fluad  Tetra/Quad/Quadrivalent)  is  an  egg-derived 
inactivated  subunit  quadrivalent  influenza  virus  vaccine  adjuvanted  with  MF59C.1  (MF59),  a  squalene-
based oil-in-water emulsion. Fluad Tetra/Quad/Quadrivalent is licensed in the European Union [EU] for use 
in adults aged 65 years and over.  
Seqirus submits a Type II variation for the extension of the age indication for Fluad Tetra, for use in persons 
50 years of age and older, based on final results from study V118_23 (EudraCT: 2021-001721-40). This is 
a Phase 3, Randomized, Observer-blind, Controlled, Multicenter, Clinical Study to Evaluate Immunogenicity 
and Safety of an MF59-adjuvanted Quadrivalent Subunit Inactivated Influenza Vaccine in Comparison with 
a Licensed Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine, in Adults 50 to 64 Years of Age. 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
To assess the registration of aQIV for use in persons 50 years of age and older, this assessment report 
provides a summary of the benefits and risks of aQIV for prevention of influenza in persons 50 to 64 years 
of age based on the data generated in clinical study V118_23. 
Disease or condition 
Influenza is a highly contagious infectious disease that occurs in epidemics throughout the winter months 
in temperate climates in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The influenza virus is an orthomyxovirus 
with two clinically relevant types (types A and B).  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/533902/2023 
Page 6/85 
 
 
 
 
Type  A  viruses  are  associated  with  both  annual  epidemics  and  pandemics,  and  B  viruses  contribute  to 
annual epidemics. The type A viruses are further divided into different subtypes, of which the A/H3N2 and 
A/H1N1 viruses are the most clinically relevant for the annual influenza disease burden. For influenza B, 
only a single type is known to exist, but 2 distinct genetic lineages are identified: Yamagata and Victoria.  
Influenza  is  characterized  by  the  abrupt  onset  of  respiratory  and  systemic  symptoms,  such  as  fever, 
myalgia, headache, severe malaise, nonproductive cough, sore throat, and rhinitis and generally resolves 
within  2  to  7  days.  However,  influenza  can  exacerbate  underlying  medical  conditions  and/or  lead  to 
secondary  viral  or  bacterial  pneumonia  for  some  people,  notably  older  adults  and  those  with  chronic 
diseases (including pulmonary or circulatory disorders, metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus, renal 
dysfunction, or immunosuppression). 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
The MAH submitted a Type II variation for the extension of the age indication for Fluad Tetra. The proposed 
indication reads “Prophylaxis of influenza in adults (50 years of age and older). Fluad Tetra should be used 
in accordance with official recommendations.” 
Epidemiology, risk factors and prevention of influenza disease 
Vaccination is considered the best strategy to lower the burden of influenza disease. However, the efficacy 
of influenza vaccines in older individuals is significantly lower than in younger individuals due to the aging 
of the immune system as well as underlying medical conditions, factors which increase the risk of influenza 
complications and interfere with immune responses.  
For  adults  over  the  age  of  50  years,  the  ability  to  respond  well  to  vaccination  is  affected  by 
immunosenescence, in which advancing age diminishes the effectiveness of the immune system. Immune 
responses against conventional trivalent influenza vaccines in adults ≥58 years of age have been shown to 
be 10% to 23% lower than in adults younger than 58 years of age. 
While it is well established that adults 65 years and older are at greater risk of serious complications from 
influenza compared with young, healthy adults, there is growing recognition of a high burden of disease in 
adults aged 50 to 64 years of age.  
In the EU, approximately 93 million people are between the age of 50 to 64 years. The impact of seasonal 
influenza on hospitalizations and mortality was evaluated for 10 influenza seasons between 1996 and 2006 
in  five European  countries (Netherlands,  United Kingdom,  France,  Portugal, and Spain), using a  Poisson 
regression  model  with  age-specific  consultation  rates  for  influenza-like  illness  and  acute  respiratory 
infection. For hospitalizations, the percentage of admissions due to respiratory disease caused by influenza 
activity for the 50 to 64 years age group ranged between 2.7% and 4.8% and the percentage of admissions 
due to pneumonia and influenza ranged between 3.3% and 12.3%. For deaths, the percentage of all-cause 
mortality caused by influenza activity in the 50 to 64 years age group was between 1.7% and 3.4%, lower 
than the 3.2% and 7.4% range observed in the age group 65 years and older. The percentage of mortality 
due to respiratory disease caused by influenza activity was similar for the age groups 50 to 64 years and 
65 years and older, 9.4%-19.4% and 9.4%-19.3%, respectively as was the percentage of mortality due to 
pneumonia and influenza caused by influenza activity 11.8%-24.5% and 12.1%-25.1%, respectively. These 
data  indicate  influenza  disease  contributes  to  a  substantial  health  burden  in  the  50  to  64-year-old 
population. 
In the EU, seasonal influenza vaccine is also recommended for older adults with age of recommendation 
ranging from ≥50 to ≥65 years.

Given increased susceptibility to infectious diseases with aging, novel vaccine formulations are needed to 
elicit effective immunity in older individuals. One way to increase the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines 
is by using adjuvants. The mechanism of action of the adjuvant MF59 has been extensively detailed in the 
initial  dossier.  The  immune-enhancing  benefit  of  the  adjuvant  MF59  in  aQIV  has  been  demonstrated  in 
persons 65 years of age and older and its effect is described for persons 50 years and older in the current 
procedure.  
2.1.2.  About the product 
The investigational product in this study, adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine (aQIV), is an MF59-
adjuvanted egg-derived subunit inactivated quadrivalent influenza virus vaccine. A 0.5-mL dose has been 
formulated to contain 15 μg hemagglutinin (HA) of each influenza virus strain, including both A/H1N1 and 
A/H3N2 strains and strains of both B lineages. 
Adjuvanted  Quadrivalent  Influenza  Vaccine  (aQIV;  Fluad  Tetra/Quad/Quadrivalent)  is  an  egg-derived 
inactivated  subunit  quadrivalent  influenza  virus  vaccine  adjuvanted  with  MF59C.1  (MF59),  a  squalene-
based oil-in-water emulsion. The quadrivalent version of Fluad, containing A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Yamagata, 
and  B/Victoria  strains,  is  licensed  in  Australia  (since  24  Sep  2019),  the  US  (since  21  Feb  2020),  the 
European Union plus Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein (since 20 May 2020), New Zealand (since 17 Dec 
2020), United Kingdom (since 01 Jan 2021), Argentina (since 27 May 2022), Brazil (since 26 September 
2022), Republic of Korea (since 19 September 2022) and Taiwan (since 07 February 2023) for use in adults 
aged 65 years and older.  
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The clinical development program to support registration of the quadrivalent version of Fluad (adjuvanted 
quadrivalent influenza vaccine; aQIV) builds upon the development program of the trivalent version of the 
vaccine (aTIV). The trivalent version (containing 2 influenza A strains [A/H1N1 and A/H3N2] and 1 influenza 
B  strain  [B/Yamagata  or  B/Victoria])  has  been  licensed  for  use  in  persons  65  years  of  age  and  older  in 
Europe since 1997 and in the US since 2015. 
Study V118_23 was designed as a randomized, comparator-controlled, observer-blind, multicenter study 
to  evaluate  the  immunogenicity  and  safety  of  aQIV  with  respect  to  a  licensed  nonadjuvanted  QIV 
comparator in subjects 50 to 64 years of age. 
The design of the study is consistent with the EMA Guideline on Influenza Vaccines (EMA 2016) and with 
the  CBER  Guidance  for  Industry:  Clinical  Data  Needed  to  Support  the  Licensure  of  Seasonal  Inactivated 
Influenza Vaccines (CBER 2007).  
The  Statistical  Analysis  Plan  (SAP)  for  Study  V118_23  is  compliant  with  International  Conference  on 
Harmonization  (ICH)  Harmonized  Tripartite  Guideline,  5  February  1998,  Statistical  Principles  for  Clinical 
Trials, E9; World Health Organization, WHO Technical Report, Series No. 924. 2004, Annex 1: Guidelines 
on Clinical Evaluation of Vaccines: Regulatory Expectations; and FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and 
Research  (CBER)  Guidance  for  Industry,  May  2007,  Clinical  Data  Needed  to  Support  the  Licensure  of 
Seasonal Inactivated Influenza Vaccines. 
Fluad Tetra (aQIV) is authorised in the EU, from May 2020, for subjects older than 65  years of age and 
older. This quadrivalent influenza vaccine contains 15 μg hemagglutinin (HA) of each influenza virus strain, 
including both A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 strains and strains of both B lineages. The vaccine is an egg-derived, 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/533902/2023 
Page 8/85 
 
 
 
 
inactivated,  MF-59-adjuvanted vaccine that shows an  increased immunogenicity  in  subjects 65 YOA  and 
older.  
Considering the public health impact of severe disease caused by influenza infection in the age group 50-
64 YOA (particularly in those with certain comorbidities), it is acknowledged that the MAH decided to carry 
out study V118_23 to assess the benefits and risks of this adjuvanted vaccine in this age group, in order 
to support registration of aQIV for use in persons from 50 years of age. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
Study V118_23 was designed, implemented, and reported in accordance with the ICH Harmonized Tripartite 
Guidelines  for  Good  Clinical  Practice  (ICH  E6(R2)),  with  applicable  local  regulations  including  European 
Directive 2001/20/EC, US Code of Federal Regulations Title 21, and Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and 
Welfare, with Seqirus codes on protection of human rights, and with the ethical principles laid down in the 
Declaration of Helsinki (European Parliament 2001; FDA 1997; ICH 2016). 
The clinical trial V118_23 was performed in accordance with GCP, as indicated by the MAH. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Due to the nature of the product (i.e. a vaccine comprised of proteins in an adjuvanted buffer solution) no 
ERA  studies  have  been  performed,  since  the  product  is  unlikely  to  result  in  a  significant  risk  to  the 
environment. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The absence of ERA studies is considered acceptable due to the nature of the product. 
Considering the above data, aQIV is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The initial aQIV regulatory submission included immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety data of 4 completed 
paediatric aQIV studies (V104P2, V118_05, V118_05E1, and V118_05E3), 2 completed older adult aQIV 
studies (≥65 years of age; V118_18 and V118_20) and several aTIV studies conducted in paediatric and 
adult populations (see Clinical Overview – Paediatric and Clinical Overview – Elderly, respectively).  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/533902/2023 
Page 9/85 
 
 
 
 
The current data package includes data from Study V118_23 which compared immunogenicity and safety 
of aQIV vs a licensed non-adjuvanted QIV comparator in subjects 50 to 64 years of age.  
2.3.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
Overview of Biopharmaceutics 
No bioequivalence studies were performed in the aQIV clinical development program. 
No changes have been made to the formulation of aQIV for the requested extension of the age indication: 
the formulation is identical to the approved marketed formulation in adults 65 years of age and older. 
Overview of Clinical Pharmacology 
No classical clinical pharmacology or pharmacokinetic studies were performed in the development 
program of aQIV and aTIV. Pharmacokinetic properties of influenza vaccines do not provide useful 
information for establishing adequate dosing recommendations (EMA 2006). 
2.3.3.  Assays supporting immunogenicity assessment 
Assessment  of  immunogenicity  in  Study  V118_23  followed  guidance  in  Section  III.B.1.a  of  the  CBER 
Guidance  for  Industry:  Clinical  Data  Needed  to  Support  the  Licensure  of  Seasonal  Inactivated  Influenza 
Vaccines (CBER 2007). Serological samples were collected at baseline (ie, before vaccination) and at 21 
days after vaccination for evaluation of immunogenicity. 
All  sera  were  tested  by  validated  hemagglutination  inhibition  (HI)  assays  performed  at  one  central 
laboratory (Viroclinics Biosciences BV, Rotterdam, The Netherlands).   
The hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) assay is a method for assessing immune responses to influenza virus 
hemagglutinin (HA), a protein on the surface of a virus particle. This protein can agglutinate erythrocytes 
by binding to receptors on the membrane of red blood cells. Specific attachment of antibody to the antigenic 
sites on the HA molecule interferes with the binding between the viral HA and receptors on the erythrocytes. 
This  results  in  an  inhibition  of  the  agglutination.  The  highest  dilution  of  antibody,  which  still  prevents 
agglutination of the virus with erythrocytes, can be used to quantitate virus specific antibodies. In addition, 
the HAI assay can be used for the typing and subtyping of seasonal strains of influenza viruses by using 
reference sera, for instance obtained from ferrets after infection with selected influenza virus strains.  
A validation report of the hemagglutination inhibition assay for the following influenza strains is provided 
(VC-VAL-VAL150-RPT_C):  A/Victoria/2570/2019  (H1N1p2009);  A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020  IVR-224 
(H3N2); B/Victoria/705/2018 BVR-11 (B-Victoria lineage), and B/Phuket/3073/2013 BVR-1B (B-Yamagata 
lineage).  The  validation  report  of  the  analytical  procedure  for  detecting  antibody  responses  by 
hemagglutination  inhibition  assay  (as  described  in  SOP  VC-M005)  included  assessment  of  precision, 
repeatability,  intermediate  precision,  format  variability,  dilutional  linearity/relative  accuracy,  and 
specificity. 
The HI assays were validated for use before clinical samples were tested. 
The  use  of  the  Hemagglutination  Inhibition  (HI)  assay  as  the  primary  assay  to  assess  vaccine 
immunogenicity is in agreement with the recommendations of the Guideline on Influenza Vaccines (Non-
clinical  and  clinical  module)  (EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014).  It  is  also  considered  adequate  that  serum 
samples were analysed for HI titres both at baseline (before vaccination) and at day 21 post-vaccination. 
The MAH provided a detailed document describing the validation of the HI assay for the four viral antigens, 
which  included  assessing  the  precision,  repeatability,  intermediate  precision,  format  variability,  dilution 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/533902/2023 
Page 10/85 
 
 
 
 
linearity/relative  accuracy,  and  specificity  of  the  HI  test.  The  data  submitted  supported  the  adequate 
validation of the HI assay. The MAH also provided the protocol.   
Considering  the  results  described  below,  it  was  considered  important  for  this  application  that  the 
microneutralization (MN) data were made available during the procedure since these data may give further 
insight into the effect of the adjuvanted vs. control vaccine. The MAH indicated that using MN assays was 
an exploratory objective and that neutralization testing is currently not planned to be conducted. Indeed, 
these  data  would  have  been  valuable  in  assessing  this  variation  procedure  in  a  situation  in  which  the 
superiority criterion based on HI titres was not met. Nonetheless, following assessment of the new data 
provided by the MAH in response to the MO, the data based on neutralization assays was not considered 
critical, and thus this issue was not further pursued.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
The vaccine tested in trial V118_23 contains the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigen from four viral strains 
grown in eggs, and the adjuvant MF-59. The dose (0.5 ml) of 15 μg HA per viral strain is in agreement with 
the Eur. Ph. requirements. This same composition is the one currently approved for use in subjects 65 years 
of age and older and it is also noted that most of the inactivated influenza vaccines used in the EU contain 
also 15 μg HA (in 0.5 ml) per viral strain. 
Thus, it is agreed that the same formulation for subjects 50-64 YOA than the one currently approved for 
65 years of age and olderwas tested, without performing additional dose finding studies. 
2.4.2.  Main study

It is noted that the MAH used a comorbidity risk score, which is a validated predictor of risk of complications 
from influenza in elderly subjects (65 years of age and older); a score of <50 is considered low risk and a 
score of ≥50 is considered high risk of complications from influenza. (Hak et al. 2004). As it is shown in 
the table here below, the comorbidity risk score assessment incorporates medical comorbidity and other 
baseline  characteristics  such  as  age,  gender,  outpatient  visits  during  the  previous  year  and  previous 
hospitalizations due to pneumonia or influenza.

influenza and death due to any cause (Hak et al. 2004) 
Treatments 
There were two study vaccines in this study: the Investigational Vaccine aQIV (Fluad Tetra/Quadrivalent), 
and the Comparator Vaccine Fluarix Tetra/Quadrivalent (nonadjuvanted QIV) (GlaxoSmithKline 
Biologicals, Germany). 
 aQIV is an MF59-adjuvanted egg-derived subunit inactivated quadrivalent influenza virus vaccine 
manufactured by Seqirus. 
 Fluarix Tetra/Quadrivalent (nonadjuvanted QIV) is a nonadjuvanted egg-derived split inactivated 
quadrivalent influenza virus vaccine composed of antigens from 4 influenza strains: 2 influenza A strains 
(A/H1N1 and A/H3N2) and 2 influenza B strains (B/Yamagata and B/Victoria).

For both vaccines, the strain composition was that recommended by the World Health Organization 
(WHO) for quadrivalent influenza vaccines contemporaneous to the timing of the study, ie, the Northern 
Hemisphere 2021/2022 influenza. 
The composition of both vaccines is provided in the following table.

The product batch numbers of aQIV were 8552A1C (expiry date: 30 Apr 2022) for study sites in Estonia 
and Germany, and 316575 (expiry date: 11 May 2022) for study sites in the US.   
The product batch numbers of QIV were PD237 (expiry date: 30 Jun 2022) for study sites in Estonia and 
Germany, and PD237 and KA92R (expiry date: 30 Jun 2022) for study sites in the US. Subjects receiving 
QIV at Site 84006 in the US received batch PD237; subjects receiving QIV at all other sites in the US 
received batch KA92R.  
The  study  participants  were  individuals  50  to  64  years  of  age  (i.e.  50  to  ≤64  years),  and  subjects  with 
controlled clinical conditions were allowed to participate in the trial. Those with abnormal function of the 
immune  system  were  excluded.  This  approach  was  endorsed  since  it  allows  inclusion  of  subjects  with 
comorbidities that put them at a higher risk of influenza complications.  
The MAH used a comorbidity risk score, which is a validated predictor of risk of complications from influenza 
in elderly subjects (65 years of age and older); a score of <50 is considered low risk and a score of ≥50 is 
considered  high  risk  of  complications  from  influenza  (Hak  et  al.  2004).  The      comorbidity  risk  score 
assessment  incorporates  medical  comorbidity  and  other  baseline  characteristics  such  as  age,  gender, 
outpatient visits during the previous year and previous hospitalizations due to pneumonia or influenza. This 
approach was considered acceptable although routinely, to assess the impact of comorbidities on immune 
response  induced  by  vaccination,  the  subjects  are  classified  in  those  with  or  without  underlying  chronic 
conditions (that put them at risk of severe influenza disease), without taking into account other baseline 
characteristics. 
Differences in strain composition are noted for two out of the four strains in the two vaccines (aQIV and 
QIV)  used  in  the  pivotal  trial  (namely,  H3N2  and  B/Victoria  strains).  It  is  acknowledged  that  both 
formulations are in accordance with WHO and CHMP recommendations for quadrivalent influenza vaccines 
contemporaneous to the timing of the study, season 2021-2022. The MAH was asked to comment on the 
possible impact on the HI results obtained due to using two vaccines with different composition (regarding 
strains H3 and B/Victoria) in trial V118_23. As described by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC), influenza viruses are considered to be antigenically similar or “like” each other if their HI titres differ 
by 2 dilutions or less (CDC 2022). Thus, given the designation of these CVVs as antigenically like by public 
health experts, the use of one target virus in the HI assay to represent the A/H3N2 vaccine strain and the 
B/Victoria vaccine strain is considered to have no major implications. However, it should be noted that the 
actual  impact  of  using  the  vaccine  strains  in  the  HAI  assay  on  the  measured  immune  responses  is  not 
known,  and  thus,  a  biased  GMT  ratio  estimate  could  not  be  formally  excluded.  Given  that  NI  is  clearly 
demonstrated,  it  is  however  agreed  that  this  should  probably  not  have  major  implications  for  the  NI 
conclusion. 
 The MAH was asked to  comment on the implications on the HI results considering that validation of the 
HI  assay  was  performed  on  strains  present  in  aQIV  (A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020  IVR-224  (H3N2)  and 
B/Victoria/705/2018 BVR-11 (B-Victoria lineage)) but not on the strains present in the comparator vaccine 
(A/Tasmania/503/2020 (IVR-221) (H3N2) and B/Washington/02/2019 (B-Victoria lineage). It is considered 
that this issue has no major implications in the results obtained.  
It is noted that aQIV is a subunit vaccine, whereas the Comparator (QIV) is a split vaccine.

1a.  To  demonstrate  immunological  noninferiority  of  aQIV  versus  a  nonadjuvanted  quadrivalent 
influenza  comparator  (QIV)  in  subjects  50-64  years  of  age,  as measured  by  hemagglutination  inhibition 
(HI) GMTs and SCRs for each vaccine strain, at 3 weeks after vaccination.  
Success criteria: Noninferiority will be demonstrated if the upper limit (UL) of the 95% confidence interval 
(CI) for the inter-group GMT ratio1 (QIV/aQIV) is ≤1.5 for each vaccine strain, and the UL of the 95% CI 
for the difference in SCR2 (QIV – aQIV) is ≤10% for each vaccine strain.  
1b. To demonstrate that aQIV induces a superior immune response compared with QIV in subjects 
50-64 years of age as measured by HI GMTs at 3 weeks after vaccination for at least 2 of the 4 vaccine 
strains.  
Success criteria: Superior immune response will  be demonstrated if the UL of the 95% CI for the inter-
group GMT ratio (QIV/aQIV) is <1.0 for at least 2 of the 4 vaccine strains. 
SECONDARY IMMUNOGENICITY OBJECTIVES:

EXPLORATORY IMMUNOGENICITY ENDPOINTS 
Persistence of the immune response of aQIV compared to QIV at Day 271 will be assessed for HI GMT and 
GMT  ratio  for  all  strains  included  in  the  vaccines  in  a  similar  fashion  as  for  secondary  immunogenicity 
objective 2b and through the same descriptive immune response parameters as presented for secondary 
immunogenicity  objective  2c.  This  exploratory  analysis  at  Day  1 and  Day  271  will  be  reported  in  a  CSR 
addendum. 
For  this  analysis,  Day  1  serum  samples  obtained  for  the  primary  and  secondary  study  objectives 
(noninferiority and superiority assessments) will be retested. Day 1 data from the exploratory assessment 
of persistence at 9 months will not replace data obtained for the primary and secondary endpoint analyses. 
Additional exploratory immunogenicity endpoints that may be assessed in the study include the measures 
of  immunogenicity  of  aQIV  and  QIV  as  determined  by  the  HI  or  microneutralization  (MN)  assay  against 
homologous or heterologous strains at Day 1, Day 22, Day 181, and Day 271 (depending on availability of 
adequate sera and on assay  availability). These analyses (if  performed) will  be reported in  a (separate) 
CSR addendum. 
As indicated, in trial V118_23, there is no clinical efficacy endpoint, but only immunological endpoints. This 
approach is acceptable, in agreement with current influenza virus vaccines guideline (Guideline on influenza 
vaccines – non-clinical and clinical Module -EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014). 
Immune response against the four homologous egg-derived vaccine strains was measured in terms of: 1) 
GMT  of  HI  antibodies  (on  Day  1,  Day  22,  for  the  primary  analysis,  and  also  titers  at  Day  181  for  some 
secondary  analysis,  and  2)    SCR  (seroconversion  rate):  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  either  a 
prevaccination HI titre <1:10 and a postvaccination HI titre ≥1:40 or a prevaccination titre ≥1:10 and a 
≥4-fold  increase  in  postvaccination  titre  (measured  on  Day  22  and  Day  181).  The  use  of  GMT  of  HI 
antibodies and SCRs is considered adequate to compare the immune response induced by the two vaccines. 
The definition used for SCR is also considered adequate and it has been used in many other immunogenicity 
comparisons  between  influenza  vaccines.  Moreover,  the  definition  of  SCR  is  considered  adequate  and  in 
fact this definition was already mentioned in a previous CHMP guideline (Note for guidance on harmonization 
of requirements for influenza vaccines –CPMP/BWP/214/96), which is no longer in use.  
The MAH established two primary objectives: The first one (1a) involves demonstration of non-inferiority 
of aQIV compared to QIV, for each of the four viral strains, in terms of HI GMT ratio (four comparisons, one 
per  viral  strain  included  in  the  vaccine)  and  the  SCR  difference  (four  comparisons,  one  per  viral  strain 
included in the vaccines). Non-inferiority will be demonstrated if the upper limit (UL) of the 95% confidence 
interval (CI) for the inter-group GMT ratio (QIV/aQIV) is ≤1.5 for each vaccine strain, and the UL of the 
95% CI for the difference in SCR2 (QIV – aQIV) is ≤10% for each vaccine strain. The approach taken for 
endpoint 1a as well as the non-inferiority margins chosen are considered acceptable and are in line with 
those used in previous influenza vaccine immunogenicity comparisons. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/533902/2023 
Page 17/85 
 
 
 
 
The second primary endpoint (1b) is aimed at demonstrating that aQIV induces a superior immune response 
compared with QIV as measured by HI GMTs at 3 weeks after vaccination for at least 2 of the 4 vaccine 
strains. The success criterion is that superior immune response will be demonstrated if the UL of the 95% 
CI for the inter-group GMT ratio (QIV/aQIV) is <1.0 for at least 2 of the 4 vaccine strains. 
It  is  noted  that  the  current  guideline  on  influenza  vaccines  (non-clinical  and  clinical  module 
EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014) states: 
-“Alternatively,  subject  to  adequate  justification,  Applicants  could  choose  to  conduct  an  active 
controlled study i.e. in which the control vaccine is an approved influenza vaccine. In this case the study 
may be designed to show superiority of the test vaccine over an authorised product (e.g. an adjuvanted 
vaccine  vs.  a  non-adjuvanted  vaccine).  Depending  on  the  characteristics  of  the  test  vaccine  and  of  the 
selected comparator, and subject to adequate justifications, it may be acceptable to plan a primary analysis 
based  on  showing  non-inferior  efficacy.  The  choice  of  non-inferiority  margins  should  be  appropriately 
justified by the Applicant. 
“To authorise the use of a new adjuvanted surface antigen vaccine in adults and/or the elderly an 
advantage in terms of immune responses is required to justify the inclusion of an adjuvant. Such advantage 
may  be  based  on  a  demonstration  of  superior  immunogenicity  vs.  a  non-adjuvanted  but  otherwise 
comparable  authorised  vaccine  that  has  been  reviewed  by  EU  competent  regulatory  authorities.  An 
advantage for the adjuvanted vs. non-adjuvanted formulation could include a higher seroconversion rate, 
higher antibody titres (based on GMTs or proportions reaching a predefined cut-off titre) or other immune 
response parameters, including increased breadth or duration of response.” 
Taking  into  consideration  the  previous  statements  from  the  CHMP  influenza  vaccines  guideline,  the 
approach  taken  by  the  MAH  that  requires  meeting  the  two  primary  objectives  (non-inferiority  and 
superiority)  to  support  approval  of  aQIV  for  subjects  from  50  to  64  YOA  was  considered  acceptable. 
However, the CHMP guideline on influenza vaccines does not specify if superiority needs to be demonstrated 
for all four strains, but it is considered that the endpoint proposed by the MA is poorly demanding, since it 
only requires demonstration of superiority in terms of GMT ratio for at least 2 of the 4 vaccine strains. It is 
considered that optimally, superiority of aQIv vs QIV in terms of GMT ratio should have been demonstrated 
for the four viral strains to robustly demonstrate the role of the adjuvant in terms of inducing an increase 
of the immune response in comparison with a non-adjuvanted vaccine.  Thus, the MAH was asked to justify 
the success criterion for primary endpoint 1b (aimed to demonstrate increased immune response of aQIv 
vs QIV) that requires showing superiority for at least two of the 4 viral strains, when optimally superiority 
should have been demonstrated for the four viral strains. The MAH indicated that responses to influenza 
vaccine strains show high variability across seasons and by strain; in particular, influenza B vaccine strains 
in recent years have been less immunogenic. Accordingly, a success criterion of at least 2 of the 4 viral 
strains being superior to the comparator vaccine represents a clinically meaningful benefit. 
There are two secondary objectives (2a and 2b), that involved determining GMT ratio (QIV/aQIV) at Day 
22  (2a)  and  181  (2b)  for  the  four  strains  included  in  the  vaccine.  In  relation  to  endpoint  2a,  Superior 
immune response of aQIV compared to QIV will be demonstrated if the UL of the 98.73% CI for the inter-
group GMT ratio (QIV/aQIV) is <0.67 for one or more vaccine strains. Objective 2b, to demonstrate greater 
persistence of the immune response for at least one vaccine strain at 6 months after vaccination, being the 
success criteria “Greater persistence of the immune response will be demonstrated if the UL of the 98.73% 
CI for the inter-group GMT ratio (QIV/aQIV) is <1.0 for one or more vaccine strains.”  
Although the analysis of objectives 2a and 2b uses a higher threshold for superiority than that assessed in 
objective 1b, it is questioned the relevance of this objective from the point of view of the overall increased 
clinical protection provided by aQIV, since endpoint 2a can just be reached by showing superiority to only 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/533902/2023 
Page 18/85 
 
 
 
 
 
one of the four viral strains. Similarly, meeting the secondary objective 2b (greater persistence of immune 
response)  can  be  met  by  just  showing  greater  persistence  of  immune  response  to  just  one  of  the  four 
strains.  
Endpoint 2c is aimed to evaluate the immunogenicity of aQIV compared with QIV as measured by HI as 
follows: GMT of HI antibodies on Day 1, Day 22, and Day 181; Geometric mean fold increase (GMFI): the 
geometric mean of the fold increase of postvaccination HI titre over the prevaccination HI titre (Day 22/Day 
1, Day 181/Day 1), and the percentage of subjects with a titrer ≥1:40 at Day 1, Day 22, and Day 181. This 
endpoint does not imply any hypothesis testing.  
Exploratory objectives include persistence of the immune response of aQIV compared to QIV at day 271 as 
determined  by  HI  assays,  and  assessment  of  the  immunogenicity  against  homologous  or  heterologous 
strains by either HI or microneutralization. The MAH indicated that neutralization testing was an exploratory 
objective and that is currently not planned to be conducted. Results on persistence of immune response at 
day 271 were provided upon request by the MAH. The new data did not alter the conclusions stated.   
Sample size 
The  sample  size  of  2018  subjects  has  been  calculated  to  achieve  a  90%  power  based  on  the  primary 
endpoints: non-inferiority of GMT and SCR differences of aQIV vs QIV for all strains and superiority of GMT 
of aQIV vs QIV for at least 2/4 vaccine strains with a one-sided alpha of 2.5%. The assumptions for both 
endpoints and for each strain are based on the results from a similar study comparing trivalent Influenza 
vaccines (V7P38). This calculation takes into account a dropout rate of 10%.  
The  assumptions  and  operating  characteristics  of  the  sample  size  estimation  are  well  described.  The 
operating characteristics meet regulatory requirements and the sample size calculations appear adequate.  
Thus  with  1:1  randomization,  assuming  that  B/Victoria  and  B/Yamagata  were  similar,  1,816  evaluable 
subjects would provide an overall power of 90% to demonstrate the primary objectives of noninferiority 
and  superiority  of  aQIV  vs  QIV  with  one-sided  alpha=0.025.  Assuming  a  10%  drop  out  rate,  the  total 
sample size for the study needed was 2,018. 
Randomisation 
An  Interactive  Response  Technology  (IRT)  system  was  used  in  the  study.  Subjects  were  enrolled  and 
stratified equally into two age groups (50 to ≤59 years and 60 to ≤64 years) with approximately 50% of 
subjects per age group. Within each age group, subjects were randomized to aQIV or QIV according to a 
1:1  ratio.  Stratification  for  history  of  any  influenza  vaccination  within  the  previous  3  influenza  seasons 
(yes/no) was applied to all subjects. Stratification according to age was considered adequate. 
After signing the ICF, if an individual was determined to be eligible for study participation, the investigator 
enrolled the subject using the IRT system. Enrolled subjects were assigned a Subject Identification (ID) 
and randomized in the IRT system in a 1:1 ratio to receive either aQIV or QIV with age (50 to ≤59 years/60 
to ≤64 years) and history of any influenza vaccination within the previous 3 influenza seasons (yes/no) as 
stratification factors. Approximately 50% of subjects were to be enrolled into each age group. The list of 
randomization assignments was produced by the IRT service provider and approved by Seqirus according 
to applicable Seqirus Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). 
If for any reason, after signing the ICF, a subject who was eligible and enrolled failed to be randomized, 
this  was  called  a  randomization  failure  and  the  early  termination  study  procedures  were  applied.  The 
information on subjects who were randomization failures was kept distinct from subjects who were screen 
failures.

Regarding the stratification factor “any influenza vaccination within the previous 3 influenza seasons” rather 
than “influenza vaccination in the previous influenza season” it was clarified that this was due the variability 
between  countries and EU/US.  Thus, the  Company  applies an interval  of  3 influenza seasons to capture 
recent influenza vaccine exposure. In this study, the majority of subjects reported as previously vaccinated 
received their influenza vaccine in the year just prior to the year of study conduct (81% of subjects). 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was an observer-blind study. During the treatment period of the study, designated and trained 
unblinded nurse(s), physician(s), or other qualified healthcare professionals were responsible for preparing 
and administering the study vaccines to the subjects. They were instructed not to reveal the identity of the 
study vaccines to the subject or to the investigative site personnel (ie, blinded investigator and study nurse) 
involved  in  the  monitoring  of  conduct  of  the  trial,  except  in  an  emergency  if  unblinding  in  IRT  was  not 
possible. Vaccine administration was shielded from the subject and blinded study personnel. The unblinded 
personnel were not involved in data collection or data review such as safety assessments and/or in collection 
of study data after the vaccinations. Study vaccines were assigned through an IRT system. 
All personnel involved in the conduct of the study or in the analysis of the final study results, or who had 
contact with study centers, remained blinded to the treatment codes until the clinical database had been 
locked,  protocol  deviations  (except  for  Day  271  serum  sample  analysis  protocol  deviations)  had  been 
assessed,  and  the  data  released  for  statistical  analysis.  The  analysis  of  the  primary  and  secondary 
objectives for the final CSR were conducted on these data. 
All  personnel  involved  in  processing  samples  and  performing  laboratory  assays  remained  blinded  to  the 
treatment codes until all Day 271 serum samples had been tested and the results had been transferred. 
The exploratory analysis on the 9-month persistence objective will be conducted on these data and reported 
in a CSR addendum. 
The observer-blind strategy was considered acceptable taking into account that the comparator vaccine is 
a commercial vaccine. 
Statistical methods 
General issues for statistical analyses 
All  EDC  data  up  to  Visit  6  (Day  271)  at  the  time  of  database  lock,  immunogenicity  serum  lab  samples 
supporting  primary  and  secondary  objectives  collected  up  to  Visit  5  (Day  181)  and  protocol  deviations 
(except for Day 271 serum sample analysis PDs) will be used to support final CSR analysis. 
Adjustment for Covariates  
All statistical analyses for HI titers were performed on the logarithmically (base 10) transformed values. 
Individual HI titers below the detection limit (<10) were set to half of that limit (5); values above the upper 
limit of quantification were set to the upper limit. 
The main  statistical analysis includes  descriptive  statistics for  the overall  population. Subgroup analyses 
will be done by age cohort (50-59 and 60-64 year of age), previous vaccination history, sex, race, ethnicity, 
and comorbidity  risk  scores (Hak  score,  <50 and ≥50).  Summary tables will  show  unadjusted GMTs  for 
each vaccine group by time point. 
Adjusted GMTs will be calculated based on the log10-transformed antibody titers at Day 22/181/271 using 
an ANCOVA model which includes the vaccine group (aQIV and QIV), log10- transformed pre-vaccination 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

antibody titer, age cohort (50-59 or 60-64 year of age), sex, and history of any influenza vaccination within 
the 3 previous seasons (yes/no). The main analysis of binary immunogenicity endpoints (i.e., percentages 
of  subjects  with  seroconversion)  will  not  be  adjusted  for  any  of  the  covariates.  Binary  data  will  be 
summarized for each group using unadjusted estimates and will be reported together with two-sided 95% 
CIs calculated according to the Clopper-Pearson method. Sensitivity analysis may be done to include the 
vaccine  group  (aQIV  and  QIV),  stratification  factors  age  and  previous  vaccination  history,  and  sex  in  a 
generalized linear model. 
The primary methods for both primary endpoints were endorsed. However, it would have been desirable 
that more details had been provided on the "generalized linear model".  
Handling of Dropouts, Missing Data 
The distribution of subjects excluded from FAS/PPS will be described by vaccine group. 
For  immunogenicity  data,  it  may  be  reasonable  to  consider  missing  immunogenicity  values  as  missing 
completely at random (MCAR), i.e., not informative. Therefore, the immunogenicity analysis will comprise 
a complete case analysis only, without introducing any bias. Additional sensitivity analysis will be considered 
if the percentage of subjects with missing data is more than 10%. 
It was indicated that the reasons for missingness should be reported in detail so that, eventually, missing 
data may be finally considered as non-informative and complete case analysis as a valid strategy.  
It may be agreed that, apparently, a low rate of missing data appears to be less prone to bias, but this is 
not always the case as it depends on the missing data mechanism. Therefore, a more robust plan to deal 
with  deviations  from  MCAR,  and  to  cover  Missing  At  Random  (MAR)  or  Missing  Not  At  Random  (MNAR) 
situations  are  not  present  in  this  study.  In  fact,  ideally,  this  plan  should  have  been  primary  while  the 
complete case analysis should be considered as a sensitivity strategy. The Company was asked to clarify: 
in order to analyse whether missing data can play an important role with regards to the direction of the 
primary  efficacy  tests,  the  MAH  was  asked  to  provide  a  detailed  description  by  arm  of  the  reasons  and 
arguments  supporting  the  MCAR  for  all  missing  data.  Also,  the  MAH  should  present  an  analysis  of  the 
superiority primary endpoint under the MAR assumption. This analysis should be presented also for the FAS 
and PPS immunogenicity populations, as well as the “complete serology dataset”. These data were provided. 
The  reasons  provided  by  the  Applicant  for  considering  the  MCAR  approach  as  the  primary  analysis  for 
handling  major  protocol  violations  and  typical  missing  values  in  immunogenicity  analyses  (e.g.,  out-of-
window blood draws, mishandled blood samples, insufficient quantity blood samples) are not fully supported 
from a methodological perspective. Ignoring the occurrence of major protocol deviations, which might be 
potentially related to the vaccine effect is prone to bias. Therefore, this approach does not align with the 
regulatory requirements of considering strategies that provide an appropriately conservative estimate in 
the circumstances of the trial under consideration (CPMP/EWP/1776/99 Rev. 1). 
It is  acknowledged that Sponsors tend to use the MCAR approach in  vaccine efficacy studies due to the 
great magnitude of  their  databases.  However,  there is  disagreement as to whether this approach might 
somehow mitigate the negative impact of missing data on the efficacy analysis, leading to minor differences 
between  different  strategies  for  handling  such  data  (i.e.,  primary  against  sensitivity  analyses).  Notably, 
there is an inherent risk in this strategy, especially when borderline results are obtained during the efficacy 
analysis, as is the case in this particular study. In such situations, sensitivity analyses play a crucial role 
and  different  scenarios  for  the  imputation  of  missing  data  must  be  considered  to  ascertain  whether  the 
robustness of the efficacy endpoint meets the regulatory standards or not. 
The Applicant has presented two different approaches for the imputation of missing data, focusing on the 
superiority efficacy comparison of the four strains. For the FAS population, row C shows the results without 
imputation, row E shows the results for the worst-case scenario imputation and row F shows the results 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/533902/2023 
Page 21/85 
 
 
 
 
 
using stochastic regression with multiple imputations. The same analyses for the PPS population are shown 
in rows D, G and H respectively. 
Overall,  the  analyses  performed  by  the  MAH  are  welcome  as  they  provide  a  context  for  assessing  what 
might have happened if different strategies for dealing with missing data had been considered. However, 
neither  of  the  two  additional  sensitivity  analyses  presented  by  the  MAH  provides  conclusive  results 
confirming  the  superiority  of  the  experimental  vaccine  over  the  control  group  for  any  additional  strain. 
These sensitivity analyses do not ensure that the evaluation of any additional strain besides the A/H1N1 
strain  (i.e.  A/H3N2,  B/Yamagata  and  B/Victoria)  can  be  considered  statistically  significant,  including  the 
A/H3N2  strain  itself.  As  a  consequence  of  this  and  under  a  strict  statistically  point  of  view,  the  primary 
immunogenicity  objective  1b  (i.e.  the  superiority  immune  response  of  aQIV  versus  QIV  for  each  strain) 
cannot be considered statistically significant as the success criterion for superiority was not met.  
However, whether the small excess over 1 (the null effect for a ratio) at the upper limits of the GMT ratios 
(the higher upper limit was as of 1.08) might have a relevant impact on patient immunogenicity cannot be 
assessed from a purely statistical perspective. 
Analysis Sets 
All Enrolled Set 
All screened subjects who provided informed consent, received a subject ID, and provided demographic 
and/or baseline screening assessments, regardless of the subject’s randomization and treatment status 
in the study. 
All Exposed Set 
All subjects in the All Enrolled Set who received a study vaccination. 
Full Analysis Set (FAS) Immunogenicity 
All subjects in the All Enrolled Set who were randomized, received study vaccination and provided 
immunogenicity data at any time point. 
In case of vaccination error, subjects in the FAS sets were analyzed “as randomized” (ie, according to 
the vaccine the subject was designated to receive, which may be different from the vaccine the subject 
actually received). 
The FAS Immunogenicity was used for the Day 22 immunogenicity superiority comparisons and all 
secondary immunogenicity objectives. The FAS Immunogenicity was also used for a sensitivity analysis 
for the noninferiority analyses based on the PPS Immunogenicity. 
Per Protocol Set (PPS) Immunogenicity 
All subjects in the FAS Immunogenicity who: 
•  Had both Day 1 and Day 22 immunogenicity assessment 
•  Correctly received the vaccine (ie, received the vaccine to which the subjects were 
randomized and at the scheduled time points) 
•  Had no protocol deviations leading to exclusion (see Appendix 16.1.1, Protocol Section 
8.3.8) as defined prior to unblinding/analysis 
•  Were not excluded due to other reasons defined prior to unblinding or analysis (see 
Appendix 16.1.1, Protocol Section 8.3.8) 
The PPS Immunogenicity was used for the immunogenicity non-inferiority comparisons and for a sensitivity 
analysis for the superiority analyses based on the FAS Immunogenicity, where applicable. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/533902/2023 
Page 22/85 
 
 
 
 
Subgroup Analyses 
Adjusted and unadjusted immunogenicity analyses of the GMTs and SCRs were performed by stratifying 
for the following subgroups: 
•  Age cohort (50 to ≤59 years and 60 to ≤64 years) 
• 
Previous vaccination history (Yes and No) 
•  Sex (Male and Female) 
•  Race (Black or African American; White; Other10) 
•  Ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino and Not Hispanic or Latino) 
•  Comorbidity risk score11 (<50 and ≥50) 
The adjusted immunogenicity analyses were conducted using the same model as the primary analysis; if a 
subgroup  was  included  in  the  model,  it  was  removed  from  the  model  for  the  corresponding  subgroup 
analysis. 
The  different  populations  sets  (including  those  using  for  primary  analysis:  Full  Analysis  Set  (FAS) 
Immunogenicity and Per Protocol Set (PPS) Immunogenicity) are considered adequate.  
The approach proposed by the MAH implies: 1) using the FAS immunogenicity for testing objective 1b, and 
for testing the sensitivity analyses regrading objective 1a; 2) using the PPS immunogenicity for objective 
1a,  and  for  the  sensitive  analysis  regarding  objective  1b.  This  approach  is  considered  in  line  with  the 
guideline (Points to Consider on Switching between Superiority and Non-Inferiority (CPMP/EWP/482/99)) 
and thus was considered acceptable. 
Sequential Testing and Multiplicity 
Adjustment for multiple comparison and multiplicity is reflected in the CI of the success criteria, which kept 
the  type  I  error  under  5%.  For  secondary  endpoint  analyses,  sequential  testing  and  significance  level 
adjustment will be applied to keep type I error under 5%. 
For four out of four strain successes, with α=0.05 for each strain, the overall type I error is 
α4=0.00000625. 
For two out of four strain successes, with α=0.05 for each strain, the overall type I error is 
0.054+ 4 × 0.053× 0.95+6 × 0.052× 0.952=0.014019. 
For 1 out of four strain successes, with α=0.05 for each strain, the overall type I error is 
1-0.954=0.1855. 
Thus, for objective 1b): two out of four strain success, there is no need to adjust for α=0.05 to keep the 
overall type I error under 0.05. But for objectives 2a) and 2b): 1 out of four strain success, α needs to be 
adjusted to 0.01274 so that the overall type I error =1-(1- 0.01274)4=0.0499944 which is less than 0.05. 
Therefore, the CI for the secondary objectives 2a and 2b have been adjusted to 98.73% to keep overall 
family wise error rate (FWER) under 0.05. 
Confirmatory flow of tests and objectives, using a hierarchical testing approach 
As soon as any success criterion is not met, confirmatory testing will stop.

Statistical Hypothesis 
Noninferiority of aQIV to QIV (Objective 1a) 
The statistical hypotheses to be tested for the primary immunogenicity objective 1a correspond to: 
H0: GMTri >1.5, for any strain 
Ha: GMTri ≤1.5, for all strains 
and 
H0: Di >10%, for any strain 
Ha: Di ≤10%, for all strains 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/533902/2023 
Page 24/85 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
where GMTri (i=1,2,3,4) is any of the 4 strain-specific Day 22 GMT ratios, namely, 
•  GMTr1=GMTQIV/GMTaQIV for A/H1N1 strain 
•  GMTr2=GMTQIV/GMTaQIV for A/H3N2 strain 
•  GMTr3=GMTQIV/GMTaQIV for B/Yamagata strain 
•  GMTr4=GMTQIV/GMTaQIV for B/Victoria strain 
and Di (i=1,2,3,4) is the 4 strain-specific Day 22 SCR differences (πQIV,i – πaQIV,i), namely, 
•  D1=πQIV,1 – πaQIV,1 for A/H1N1 strain 
•  D2=πQIV,2 – πaQIV,2 for A/H3N2 strain 
•  D3= πQIV,3 – πaQIV,3 for B/Yamagata strain 
•  D4= πQIV,4 – πaQIV,4 for B/Victoria strain 
where πQIV,i, πaQIV,i (i=1,2,3,4) denotes the SCRs for the 4 strains in QIV and aQIV respectively. 
Superiority of aQIV to QIV (Objective 1b) 
The statistical hypotheses to be tested for the primary immunogenicity objective 1b correspond 
to: 
H0: GMTri ≥1, for at least 3 of the 4 vaccine strains at Day 22 
Ha: GMTri <1, for at least 2 of the 4 vaccine strains at Day 22 
where GMTri (i=1,2,3,4) are defined as above. 
Superiority of aQIV vs QIV (higher threshold) (Objective 2a) 
The statistical hypotheses to be tested for the secondary immunogenicity 2a correspond to: 
H0: GMTr ≥0.67, for all four vaccine strains at Day 22 
Ha: GMTr <0.67, for one or more vaccine strains at Day 22 
where GMTr is the Day 22 GMT ratios of GMTQIV/GMTaQIV for that vaccine strain. 
Persistence of immune response of aQIV compared to QIV (Objective 2b) 
To demonstrate greater persistence of the immune response for at least one of the vaccine strains at 6 
months after vaccination with aQIV compared with QIV as measured by HI assay in subjects 50-64 years 
of age, the statistical hypotheses to be tested for the secondary immunogenicity 2b correspond to: 
H0: GMTr ≥1, for all four vaccine strains at Day 181 
Ha: GMTr <1, for one or more vaccine strains at Day 181 
where GMTr is 6-month GMT ratio of GMTQIV/GMTaQIV for that strain. 
Immunogenicity of aQIV compared with QIV (Objective 2c) 
There was no statistical hypothesis for secondary immunogenicity objective 2c. 
The Applicant’s strategy to handle multiplicity and to control the type I error was based on a hierarchical 
testing  approach.  The  first  comparisons  tested  (primary  objective  1a),  correspond  to  co-primary  non-
inferiority hypotheses where, if the GMT ratio and the SCR difference are significant for all strains in the 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/533902/2023 
Page 25/85 
 
 
 
 
 
PPS population, then the primary objective 1b will be tested. For the latter, the GTM ratio is tested and 
efficacy is declared if in at least 2 out of 4 strains results are significant. The rest of secondary objectives 
(2a and 2b) are tested hierarchically after the previous primary objectives, if applicable, for superiority for 
at least 1 strain and persistence for at least 1 strain with the α-adjusted CI. This approach was considered 
acceptable. 
Results 
Participant flow 
The study population (N=2044) was slightly larger than the planned sample size of 2018 subjects because 
subjects who were already scheduled for enrolment, at the time the Sponsor was notified that the enrolment 
target had been reached, were allowed to participate in the study. 
A total of 2044 subjects 50 to 64 years of age were enrolled in the study (All Enrolled Set) and 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive aQIV or QIV. One subject was randomized to the QIV group but did 
not receive study vaccine and thus the All Exposed Set included 2043 subjects.  
The majority of subjects (1971/2044 subjects, 96.4%) completed the study (Table 3). The most common 
reason for discontinuing from the study was lost to follow-up (52/2044 subjects, 2.5%).

Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
Two protocol amendments were made during the study. The protocol amendments were implemented 
after First Subject First Visit and before Last Subject Last Visit (ie, while the study was still blinded). 
The main changes for the first protocol amendment (Version 1.0 (15 Apr 2021) to Version 2.0 (18 Nov 
2021)) were: 
1.  Updating of the CI for secondary objectives 2a and 2b to reflect the correct alpha (correcting 
95% for 98.73%).  
2.  Conducting database lock and unblinding in two stages to allow expedited CSR reporting. A 
Blinding Maintenance Plan was prepared to ensure blinding of relevant laboratory and 
statistical personnel was maintained until their activities had been completed.  
3.  Clarification of Exclusion Criteria #7b and #9, based on Estonian regulatory agency feedback.  
4.  Clarifications of reporting requirements for solicited AEs that start during Day 1-7 and 
continue beyond Day 14. 
5.  Correction of how the FAS would be analyzed in case of vaccination errors, based on FDA 
regulatory agency feedback (subjects analyzed “as randomized”, as opposed to the previuos 
“as treated”). 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/533902/2023 
Page 27/85 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
The main changes for the second protocol amendment (Version 2.0 (18 Nov 2021) to Version 3.0 (11 Jul 
2022)) were: 
1.  Reclassification of the secondary objective of immunogenicity persistence at 9 months after 
vaccination (Day 271) as an exploratory objective in order to expedite the primary and secondary 
immunogenicity results and report them with the complete safety data to support timely license 
applications in different regions. 
2.  Improvement in the definition of previous influenza vaccination as a stratification factor to 
consider subjects who had received an influenza vaccination in the previous 3 influenza seasons 
as previously vaccinated subjects (Yes) in order to acknowledge variability in timing of the annual 
influenza vaccination campaigns.  
3.  Correction of an inconsistency in the assessment and reporting of local solicited reactions to 
consider local events as being present if they measured ≥25 mm to ensure consistency with the 
approved labeling information for aQIV (Fluad Quadrivalent/Quad/Tetra).  
Changes in the planned analyses 
In the final blinded laboratory data transfer from Viroclinics for the primary and secondary immunogenicity 
analyses for this study, it was noted that multiple test results were reported as “Not Reportable Result” 
(NRR).  These  results  were  classified  as  “NRR-ASPECIFIC”  or  “NRR-  INCONSISTENT”.  The  technical 
laboratory personnel at Viroclinics explained that there were no further analytical options available to obtain 
a  test  result  for  the  NRR-ASPECIFIC  results.  In  contrast,  for  the  NRR-INCONSISTENT  results,  it  was 
identified  that  Viroclinics  failed  to  follow  their  method  SOP  to  retest  these  samples.  In  the  final  blinded 
laboratory dataset of Day 1, Day 22, and Day 181 results, there were NRR-INCONSISTENT results for 45 
subjects across the 4 vaccine strains (A/H1N1: 25 subjects; A/H3N2: 11 subjects; B/Yamagata: 6 subjects; 
B/Victoria: 10 subjects). As the target enrolment level for the study had been exceeded and the drop-out 
rate due to premature termination and protocol deviations was smaller than anticipated, it was decided to 
accept the final blinded data transfer and accept that these NRR-INCONSISTENT values would be considered 
missing values for the initial analysis. The decision to proceed with database lock and plan to retest the 
NRR-INCONSISTENT samples at a later date was taken before database unblinding.  
As  documented  in  the  second  protocol  amendment,  the  Day  271  samples  would  be  tested  after  study 
unblinding  as  an  exploratory  objective.  In  parallel  with  this  Day  271  testing  campaign,  the  samples 
previously reported as NRR-INCONSISTENT for the primary and secondary objectives completed retesting 
following  the  Viroclinics  method  SOP,  with  the  testing  laboratory  personnel  remaining  blinded  to  the 
treatment code during this testing campaign.  The  retesting results of  samples initially  reported as NRR-
INCONSISTENT were transferred to Seqirus in a cumulative blinded data output comprising the complete 
serology dataset for Day 1, Day 22, and Day 181 after database lock and the initial statistical analysis of 
the primary study objectives.  
Non-inferiority and superiority analyses based on the complete serology dataset, ie, inclusive of the retested 
NRR-INCONSISTENT samples from Day 1, Day 22, and Day 181, are presented in the CSR in together with 
the results based on the first analysis. 
Since all the serum samples included in the complete serology dataset were assayed in a blinded fashion 
and the complete serology immunogenicity data were analysed in exactly the same manner as the results 
from  the  initial  laboratory  data  transfer,  these  results  are  considered  accurate  and  valid  for  analysis. 
Therefore,  the  complete  serology  dataset  is  considered  a  relevant  dataset  for  the  immunogenicity 
conclusions. 
Overall,  the  modifications  made  to  the  protocol  were  not  considered  to  introduce  major  changes  to  the 
original design of the trial and importantly, the protocol amendments were made while the study was still 
blinded. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

In relation to the planned analysis, in the first analysis made by the MAH, the HI data used for the primary 
and secondary immunogenicity analyses excluded a number of samples (named “NRR-inconsistent” by the 
testing laboratory – Viroclincs-) from these analyses. These samples corresponded to 45 subjects across 
the 4 vaccine strains (A/H1N1: 25 subjects; A/H3N2: 11 subjects; B/Yamagata: 6 subjects; B/Victoria: 10 
subjects).  Although  according  to  the  Viroclinics  SOP,  these  samples  could  have  been  retested,  the  MAH 
decided not to include these samples in the initial analyses for the primary objectives since they had enough 
number of samples considering that the target enrolment levels had been exceeded and the dropout rate 
was smaller than anticipated.   
After database lock and the initial statistical analysis of the primary study objectives (that resulted in not 
meeting  the  superiority  primary  endpoint,  as  described  below),  the  MAH  decided  to  retest  (in  a  blinded 
manner)  the  “NRR-inconsistent”  serum  samples.  The  primary  and  secondary  analyses  were  then 
recalculated taking into account these new additional samples (analysis on the complete serology dataset).  
As further discussed in the results section, the MAH conducted a post-hoc sensitivity analysis based on the 
“Complete Serology Dataset”. From a methodological and statistical point of view, this post-hoc sensitivity 
analysis can never replace or rescue the main analysis, as there is no free alpha for confirmatory testing. 
In  fact,  this  analysis  will  be  considered  exploratory  only  and  no  confirmatory  claims  can  be  made  from 
these tests. 
The MAH indicates that the additional samples included in the complete serology dataset corresponded to 
45  subjects  across  the  4  vaccine  strains  (A/H1N1:  25  subjects;  A/H3N2:  11  subjects;  B/Yamagata:  6 
subjects; B/Victoria: 10 subjects). For clarification, the MAH was asked to detail in a table the number of 
samples analysed regarding primary endpoint 1b, for the first analysis and for the analysis based on the 
complete serology dataset for each of the four viral strains. The data should also include the number of 
sample analysed at the different time points (day 1, day 21 and day 181). The MAH provided information 
to confirm if all “NRR-Inconsistent “samples provided satisfactory results after re-analysis. It was indicated 
that there were no samples in the complete serology dataset with a result of “NRR-INCONSISTENT”.

Baseline data 
The study was conducted in Estonia (787 subjects), Germany (513 subjects), and the US (744 subjects). 
All subjects were recruited on the Northern Hemisphere 2021/2022 influenza season. The mean age of the 
All Enrolled Set was 57.8 years (SD: 4.19), with a range of 50 to 64 years, consistent with the intended 
study population. It is noted that more subjects (59%) were enrolled in the 50 to 59 years age cohort than 
in the 60 to 64 years age cohort (41%). Similarly, there more females (61%) than males (39%) enrolled 
in the trial. It is considered that these differences have no relevant impact in the results obtained in the 
trial. 
Importantly, there are no notable differences in the distribution of demographic and baseline characteristics 
between the aQIV and QIV vaccine groups. Overall, the population included in the trial reflects the intended 
indication sought by the MAH. 
There were no notable differences in the distribution of demographic and baseline characteristics between 
the aQIV and QIV vaccine groups, as shown in the following table:

Table 5: Demographics and Baseline Characteristics in Subjects 50 to 64 Years of Age (All 
Enrolled Set) 
The  MAH  provides  information  on  the  number  of  subjects  that  received  an  influenza  vaccination  in  the 
previous three seasons.  For completeness of the information, it was requested to provide information on 
the number of subjects in each arm that received a previous influenza vaccination just in the last season. 
The  MAH  clarified  that  1184  subjects  reported  “yes”  to  previous  influenza  vaccination  in  the  previous 
3 seasons, the majority (959 subjects, 81%) reported having been vaccinated in the influenza season just

prior to when the study was conducted in the NH 2021/2022 influenza season. 
Data set analysed 
The numbers of subjects included in the immunogenicity analysis sets are shown in Table 6. All subjects in 
the  All  Exposed  Set  were  included  in  the  FAS  Immunogenicity  (N=2043)  (Table  6,  Table  7),  while  77 
subjects were excluded from the PPS Immunogenicity (N=1966), most commonly for protocol deviations 
(57 subjects) (Table 7). 
Table 6: Overview of Immunogenicity Sets Analyzed (All Enrolled Set) 
The  FAS  Immunogenicity  that  was  based  on  the  complete  serology  dataset  was  identical  to  the  FAS 
Immunogenicity for the first analysis in terms of the number of subjects, but included additional data points 
for individual vaccine strains. 
The PPS Immunogenicity that was based on the complete serology dataset, included 2 more subjects in the 
QIV group compared with the PPS Immunogenicity for the first analysis. The PPS Immunogenicity for the 
complete serology dataset therefore consisted of 983 subjects in the aQIV group and 985 subjects in the 
QIV group for a total of 1968 subjects.

Table 7: Number of Subjects and Reason of Exclusion from Immunogenicity Sets (FAS 
Immunogenicity and PPS Immunogenicity) 
The  study  population  (N=2044)  was  slightly  larger  than  the  planned  sample  size  of  2018  subjects. 
Importantly, a large proportion of the enrolled subjects completed the study (95.5% of the aQIV arm and 
97.2% of the QIV arm). The small difference between the two treatment arms is due to a higher number 
of subjects “lost to follow-up” (3.4% -aQIV- vs 1.7% -QIV).  
Similarly, a large proportion (99.9%) of the subjects included in the “all enrolled set” were also included in 
the “FAS immunogenicity”. A slightly lower percentage (96.2%) of the “all enrolled set” were included in 
the “PPS immunogenicity”. The reasons for subjects being excluded from the “PPS immunogenicity” were 
similar in the two treatment arms, being the most common reason for exclusion “protocol deviation” (“did 
not comply with blood draw schedule”, and “serological tests not available”). Within this category (“protocol 
deviation”)  there  was  a  difference  of  0.8%  (16  subjects)  vs  1.6%  (8  subjects)  between  the  two  arms 
regarding the concept: “subject does not meet at least 1 inclusion or exclusion criteria”.  
It is noted that the evaluable subjects after protocol deviations and exclusions meet the estimated sample 
size for 90% of power to demonstrate the two primary endpoints (non-inferiority and superiority).  
Based on all the above comments, there is no reason to question the integrity of the trial.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoints  
Noninferiority Analysis of aQIV Versus QIV – Geometric Mean Titer Ratios (Study Objective 1a) 
In the PPS Immunogenicity first analysis, the UL of the 95% CI for the adjusted inter-group Day 22 GMT 
ratio did not exceed 1.5 for any of the 4 vaccine strains (A/H1N1: 0.87; A/H3N2: 0.99; B/Yamagata: 1.01; 
B/Victoria: 1.07) (Table 8). Therefore, the prespecified success criteria for demonstrating immunological 
noninferiority of aQIV versus a nonadjuvanted QIV were met with respect to the GMT ratio for all 4 vaccine 
strains in subjects 50 to 64 years of age.

Day 22 by HI Assay (PPS Immunogenicity) 
Analysis on the Complete Serology Dataset: Noninferiority Analysis in the PPS Immunogenicity 
For the complete serology dataset, the UL of the 95% CI for the adjusted inter-group Day 22 GMT ratio did 
not  exceed  1.5  for  any  of  the  4  vaccine  strains  (A/H1N1:  0.87;  A/H3N2:  0.99;  B/Yamagata:  1.01; 
B/Victoria: 1.07) (Table 9) and, thus, the prespecified non-inferiority success criteria for the GMT ratio were 
met for all 4 vaccine strains in the PPS Immunogenicity. These results are consistent with the first analysis 
results based on the PPS Immunogenicity.

Sensitivity Analysis: Non-inferiority Analysis in the FAS Immunogenicity 
The UL of the 95% CI for the adjusted inter-group Day 22 GMT ratio did not exceed 1.5 for any of the 4 
vaccine  strains  (A/H1N1:  0.87;  A/H3N2:  1.002;  B/Yamagata:  1.01;  B/Victoria:  1.08)  and,  thus,  the 
prespecified non-inferiority success criteria for the GMT ratio were met for all 4 vaccine strains in the FAS 
Immunogenicity (Table not shown in this AR). These results are consistent with the first analysis results 
based on the PPS Immunogenicity. 
Sensitivity Analysis on the Complete Serology Dataset: Non-inferiority Analysis in the FAS 
Immunogenicity 
The UL of the 95% CI for the adjusted inter-group Day 22 GMT ratio did not exceed 1.5 for any of the 4 
vaccine  strains  (A/H1N1:  0.88;  A/H3N2:  0.998;  B/Yamagata:  1.01;  B/Victoria:  1.07)  and,  thus,  the 
prespecified  non-inferiority  success  criteria  for  the  GMT  ratio  were  met  for  all  4  vaccine  strains  in  the 
complete serology dataset based on the FAS Immunogenicity. (Table not shown in this AR). These results 
are consistent with the first and complete serology dataset analyses based on the PPS Immunogenicity. 
Non-inferiority Analysis of aQIV Versus QIV – Seroconversion Rate Differences (Study Objective 1a) 
In the PPS Immunogenicity first analysis, the UL of the 95% CI for the SCR difference did not exceed 10% 
for  any  of  the  4  vaccine  strains  (A/H1N1:  -0.89%;  A/H3N2:  2.52%;  B/Yamagata:  2.22%;  B/Victoria: 
0.87%)  (Table  10).  Therefore,  the  prespecified  success  criteria  for  demonstrating  immunological  non-
inferiority  of  aQIV  versus  a  non-adjuvanted  QIV  were  met  with  respect  to  the  SCR  difference  for  all  4 
vaccine strains in subjects 50 to 64 years of age.

Analysis on the Complete Serology Dataset: Non-inferiority Analysis in the PPS Immunogenicity. 
For the complete serology dataset, the UL of the 95% CI for the SCR difference did not exceed 10% for 
any of the 4 vaccine strains (A/H1N1: -0.74%; A/H3N2: 2.48%; B/Yamagata: 2.00%; B/Victoria: 0.45%) 
(Table 11) and, thus, the prespecified non-inferiority success criteria for the SCR difference were met for 
all 4 vaccine strains in the PPS Immunogenicity. These results are consistent with the first analysis results 
based on the PPS Immunogenicity.

Sensitivity Analysis: Non-inferiority Analysis in the FAS Immunogenicity 
The UL of the 95% CI for the SCR difference did not exceed 10% for any of the 4 vaccine strains (A/H1N1: 
-0.31%;  A/H3N2:  2.62%;  B/Yamagata:  2.70%;  B/Victoria:  1.34%)  and,  thus,  the  prespecified  non-
inferiority success criteria for the SCR difference were met for strains in the FAS Immunogenicity. These 
results are consistent with the first analysis results based on the PPS Immunogenicity.

Sensitivity Analysis on the Complete Serology Dataset: Non-inferiority Analysis in the FAS 
Immunogenicity 
The UL of the 95% CI for the SCR difference did not exceed 10% for any of the 4 vaccine strains (A/H1N1: 
-0.17%;  A/H3N2:  2.58%;  B/Yamagata:  2.49%;  B/Victoria:  0.93%)  and,  thus,  the  prespecified  non-
inferiority success criteria for the SCR difference were met for all 4 vaccine strains in the complete serology 
dataset based on the FAS Immunogenicity. These results are consistent with the first and complete serology 
dataset analyses based on the PPS Immunogenicity. 
Non-inferiority Analysis of aQIV Versus QIV (Study Objective 1a)  
All 8 primary non-inferiority endpoints (Study Objective 1a) were met in the PPS 
Immunogenicity: 
• 
• 
The UL of the 95% CI for the GMT ratio (QIV/aQIV) was below the non-inferiority margin 
of 1.5 for all 4 vaccine strains (Table 8, Table 9). 
The UL of the 95% CI for the SCR difference (QIV – aQIV) was below the non-inferiority 
margin of 10% for all 4 vaccine strains (Table 10, Table 11). 
The results for the first and complete serology dataset analyses of non-inferiority in the PPS 
Immunogenicity were consistent with the corresponding sensitivity analyses conducted in the 
FAS Immunogenicity. As the prespecified success criteria for Study Objective 1a were met, the study was 
considered successful and non-inferiority of aQIV compared with QIV in subjects 50 to 64 years of age 
was concluded. 
All 8 primary non-inferiority endpoints (Study Objective 1a) were met in the PPS Immunogenicity first 
analysis: 
-The UL of the 95% CI for the GMT ratio (QIV/aQIV) was below the non-inferiority margin of 1.5 
for all 4 vaccine strains (A/H1N1: 0.87; A/H3N2: 0.99; B/Yamagata: 1.01; B/Victoria: 1.07).  
-The UL of the 95% CI for the SCR difference (QIV – aQIV) was below the non-inferiority margin 
of 10% for all 4 vaccine strains (A/H1N1: -0.89%; A/H3N2: 2.52%; B/Yamagata: 2.22%; B/Victoria: 
0.87%). 
Similarly, the 8 primary non-inferiority endpoints (Study Objective 1a) were met in the PPS immunogenicity 
when using the complete serology dataset.  
A sensitivity analyses performed in the FAS immunogenicity (both the initial analysis and that performed 
on the complete serology dataset) yielded again the same results (i.e, all 8 primary non-inferiority endpoints 
were met). 
In  conclusion,  the  pre-specified  success  criteria  for  Study  Objective  1a  were  met,  and  thus  the  non-
inferiority of aQIV compared with QIV in subjects 50 to 64 years of age was concluded. 
Superiority Analysis of aQIV Versus QIV – Geometric Mean Titer Ratios (Study Objective 1b) 
In the FAS Immunogenicity first analysis (Table 12), the UL of the 95% CI for the adjusted inter-group 
Day 22 GMT ratio was: 
-Below the superiority margin of 1.0 for the A/H1N1 strain (0.87) 
-Above the superiority margin of 1.0 for the B/Yamagata (1.01) and B/Victoria (1.08) 
strains; the superiority margin was marginally exceeded for the A/H3N2 strain (1.002) 
As the UL of the 95% CI in the first analysis was below the superiority margin of 1.0 for only 1 of the 4 
vaccine strains (A/H1N1), the prespecified success criterion for demonstrating a superior immune response 
for aQIV compared with QIV was not met in subjects 50 to 64 years of age.

by HI Assay (FAS Immunogenicity) 
Analysis on the Complete Serology Dataset: Superiority Analysis in the FAS Immunogenicity 
For the complete serology dataset, the point estimates of the Day 22 GMT ratios in the FAS 
Immunogenicity (Table 13) were consistent with those in the FAS Immunogenicity first analysis. In 
addition, the UL of the 95% CI for the adjusted inter-group Day 22 GMT ratio in the FAS Immunogenicity 
was: 
- Below the protocol-specified superiority margin of 1.0 for the A/H1N1 (0.88) and 
A/H3N2 (0.998) strains. 
- Above the protocol-specified superiority margin of 1.0 for the B/Yamagata (1.01) and B/Victoria 
(1.07) strains. 
Thus, for the complete serology dataset in the FAS Immunogenicity, a superior immune response was 
observed for aQIV compared with QIV for 2 of the 4 vaccine strains.

Superiority of aQIV Relative to QIV in Subjects 50 to 64 years of Age for A/H1N1, A/H3N2,

Sensitivity Analysis: Superiority Analysis in the PPS Immunogenicity 
The point estimates of the Day 22 GMT ratios in the PPS Immunogenicity were consistent with those in the 
primary FAS Immunogenicity; moreover, the UL of the 95% CI for the adjusted inter-group Day 22 GMT 
ratio was below the superiority margin of 1.0 for 2 of the 4 vaccine strains in the PPS Immunogenicity, ie, 
the A/H1N1 (0.87) and A/H3N2 (0.99) strains, and above for the B/Yamagata (1.01) and B/Victoria (1.07) 
strains. Thus, the prespecified criterion for demonstrating a superior immune response for aQIV compared 
with QIV for at least 2 strains was met in the PPS Immunogenicity. 
Sensitivity Analysis on the Complete Serology Dataset: Superiority Analysis in the PPS Immunogenicity 
The UL of the 95% CI for the adjusted inter-group Day 22 GMT ratio was below the superiority margin of 
1.0  for  2  of  4  vaccine  strains,  ie,  the  A/H1N1  (0.87)  and  A/H3N2  (0.99)  strains,  and  above  for  the 
B/Yamagata  (1.01)  and  B/Victoria  (1.07)  strains.  Thus,  for  the  complete  serology  dataset  in  the  PPS 
Immunogenicity, a superior  immune response was observed for aQIV  compared with QIV  for  2 of  the 4 
vaccine strains. 
In relation to objective 1b, in the FAS Immunogenicity first analysis, the UL of the 95% CI for the adjusted 
inter-group Day 22 GMT ratio was: 
-Below the superiority margin of 1.0 for the A/H1N1 strain (0.87). 
-Above the superiority margin of 1.0 for the B/Yamagata (1.01) and B/Victoria (1.08). 
strains; the superiority margin was marginally exceeded for the A/H3N2 strain (1.002). 
As the UL of the 95% CI in the first analysis was below the superiority margin of 1.0 for only 1 of the 4 
vaccine strains (A/H1N1), the prespecified success criterion for demonstrating a superior immune response 
for aQIV compared with QIV was not met in subjects 50 to 64 years of age. 
When the analysis was performed in the FAS Immunogenicity (complete serology dataset), the UL of the 
95% CI for the adjusted inter-group Day 22 GMT ratio was below the protocol specified superiority margin 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/533902/2023 
Page 39/85 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of  1.0 for  two  of  the  four  strains  (A/H1N1  (0.88)  and  AH3N2  (0.998)).  Thus  in  this  analysis,  a  superior 
immune response was observed for aQIV vs QIV for 2 of the 4 vaccine strains.  
The  sensitivity  analysis  performed  in  the  PPS  for  immunogenicity  (both  the  first  analysis  and  the  one 
performed in the complete serology dataset) demonstrated superiority of aQIV compared to QIV for two 
(A/H1N1 and A/H3N2) of the four vaccine strains. 
The planned primary efficacy objective consisting of the two primary endpoints, 1a (the non-inferiority of 
the GMT ratio and the SCR difference for all strains in the PPS set), and 1b (the superiority in at least 2 out 
of 4 strains in the GMT ratio in the FAS population) was not fulfilled. Therefore, the objective of the study 
to  demonstrate  immunological  efficacy  according  to  the  applicant's  study  design  was  considered  met. 
Specifically, while the non-inferiority test for objective 1a achieved statistical significance, the superiority 
assessment of the GMT ratio was not met as only one strain (A/H1N1) fulfilled the predefined superiority 
criteria. Notably, as this primary objective was not met, any further testing will not maintain Type I error 
control and  will  therefore be considered  only  exploratory  and  no  confirmatory  claims can  be made from 
these tests. Following MAH responses this issue was considered solved.  
The MAH conducted a post-hoc sensitivity analyses based on the “Complete Serology Dataset”, and then, 
and additional strain (A/H3N2) was shown to be significant. The MAH then states that the study should be 
considered as positive. From a methodological and statistical point of view, this post-hoc sensitivity analysis 
can never replace or rescue the main analysis, as there is no free alpha for confirmatory testing. 
The issue that the study failed to meet that planned primary objective, and therefore the immunological 
benefit of aQIV compared to QIV in subjects from 50 to 64 yoa could not be considered positive was raised 
as a major objection during the procedure. After the MAH responses this issue was considered solved.  
Secondary Immunogenicity Endpoints 
Superiority Analysis of aQIV Versus QIV (Higher Threshold) – Geometric Mean Titer Ratios (Study 
Objective 2a) 
The aim of Study Objective 2a was to assess a higher threshold for superiority than that assessed in Study 
Objective  1b  (ie,  a  superiority  margin  of  0.67  versus  a  superiority  margin  of  1.0).  As  described  above, 
confirmatory testing stopped at Study Objective 1b and thus analysis of superiority of aQIV versus QIV at 
the higher superiority margin of 0.67 (Study Objective 2a) was not conducted; as a result, the secondary 
immunogenicity analysis for Study Objective 2a is provided in Table 14 for descriptive purposes only.

Persistence of the Immune Response of aQIV Compared to QIV (Study Objective 2b). 
As described above, the secondary immunogenicity analysis of Day 181 HI GMTs for Study Objective 2b is 
provided for descriptive purposes only. 
The Day 181 HI GMT was observed to be higher for the A/H1N1 strain in the aQIV group compared with 
the QIV group (Table 15). There were no notable differences in Day 181 HI GMTs between the two vaccine 
groups for the A/H3N2, B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria strains.

The unadjusted analyses  of  HI  GMTs,  GMFIs,  percentage of  subjects with HI  titer  ≥1:40, and  SCRs are 
presented  for  the  FAS  Immunogenicity  in  Table  16  and  summarized  below.  The  results  in  the  complete 
serology dataset are consistent with the results summarized below (data not shown in this AR). No formal 
statistical comparisons were made between the aQIV and QIV groups.

The  MAH  followed  a  hierarchical  testing  approach  so  as  soon  as  any  success  criterion  is  not  met, 
confirmatory testing will stop. Thus, since Study Objective 1b was not met, confirmatory testing stopped 
and thus analysis of superiority of aQIV versus QIV at the higher superiority margin of 0.67 (at day 22: 
Study Objective 2a, and at day 181 GMTs: study objective 2b) was not conducted. 
The MAH provided the secondary immunogenicity analysis for descriptive purposes only.  
The descriptive data corresponding to endpoint 2c did not provide any new relevant information. In fact the 
results were in line with those shown regarding endpoints 1a and 1b. In fact, both at Day 22 and at day 
181, the HI GMT and GMFI were observed to be higher for the A/H1N1 strain in the aQIV group compared 
with the QIV group and there were no notable differences in HI GMTs and GMFIs between the two vaccine 
groups for the A/H3N2, B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria strains. Similarly, at day 22, there were no notable 
differences in the SCRs between the aQIV and QIV groups for any of the 4 vaccine strains. 
Reverse Cumulative Distribution Curves 
The immune response profiles for  the A/H1N1,  A/H3N2,  B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria strains  in  the aQIV 
and QIV groups in the FAS Immunogenicity are shown graphically using RCD curves based on Day 22 HI 
titers in Figure 11-1, Figure 11-2, Figure 11-3, and Figure 11-4, respectively. (these figure are not provided 
in this AR). 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

The  RCD  curves  display  titer  levels  (x-axis)  by  the  percentage  of  subjects  (y-axis)  having  a  titer  value 
greater than or equal to the value on the x axis. 
For the A/H1N1 strain, the RCD curve for the aQIV group was shifted to the right relative to that for the 
QIV group, suggesting a greater magnitude of immune response for this strain in the aQIV group. 
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup Analyses for Immunogenicity: Comparison of Results in Sub-Populations 
This  section  presents  subgroup  analyses  of  the  Day 22  GMT  and  GMT  ratio  immune  responses  by  age, 
previous vaccination history, sex, race, ethnicity, comorbidity risk score, and baseline HI titer for the first 
analysis in the FAS Immunogenicity. The results in the complete serology dataset are consistent with the 
subgroup analysis results summarized below (data not shown in this AR). 
Immunogenicity Results by Age 
For both the 50 to 59 years and 60 to 64 years age subgroups, the results were consistent with the overall 
study results in that the Day 22 immune response was observed to be higher for the A/H1N1 strain and 
there were no notable differences for the B strains for the aQIV group compared with the QIV group.  
For the A/H3N2 strain, the point estimates of the Day 22 GMT ratios for both age subgroups were similar 
to those observed in the overall study population; however, the 95% CIs were wider due to the smaller 
sample sizes and cross the value of 1. 
Immunogenicity Results by Previous Vaccination History 
For subjects who had received an influenza vaccination within the previous 3 influenza seasons, the results 
were  consistent  with  the overall  study  results  in  that  the  Day  22  immune  response  was  observed  to  be 
higher for the A/H1N1 strain and there were no notable differences for the other 3 strains (A/H3N2 and B 
strains) for the aQIV group compared with the QIV group.  
In  contrast,  for  subjects  who  had  not  received  an  influenza  vaccination  within  the  previous  3  influenza 
seasons (see next Table): The Day 22 immune response was observed to be higher for the A/H1N1 (GMTr: 
0.77 [0.67, 0.87]) and A/H3N2 (GMTr: 0.80 [0.68, 0.94]) strains for the aQIV group compared with the 
QIV group. 
There were no notable differences in immunogenicity at Day 22 for aQIV versus QIV for the B/Yamagata or 
B/Victoria strains.

by HI Assay by Influenza Vaccination History (FAS Immunogenicity) 
Immunogenicity Results by Sex 
For both the male and female subgroups, the results were consistent with the overall study results in that 
the Day 22 immune response was observed to be higher for the A/H1N1 strain and there were no notable 
differences for the other 3 strains (A/H3N2 and B strains) for the aQIV group compared with the QIV group. 
Immunogenicity Results by Race 
For White subjects, the results were consistent with the overall study results in that the Day 22 immune 
response was observed to be higher for the A/H1N1 strain, the point estimate of the Day 22 GMT ratio for 
the A/H3N2 strain was similar to that observed in the overall study population (however, the 95% CIs were 
wider due to the smaller sample sizes and crossed the value of 1), and there were no notable differences 
for the B strains for the aQIV group compared with the QIV group. 
For Black or African American subjects and subjects in the “Other” (including American Indian or Alaska 
Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander and Other) race category, the small numbers of 
subjects  in  these  two  race  categories  (75  and  15  subjects,  respectively)  for  these  analyses  limit  any 
conclusion for these observations. 
Immunogenicity Results by Ethnicity 
For subjects in the category of “Not Hispanic or Latino” ethnicity the results were consistent with the overall 
study results in that the Day 22 immune response was observed to be higher for the A/H1N1 strain, the 
point estimate of the Day 22 GMT ratio and the UL of the 95% CI for the H3N2 strain were similar to that 
observed in the overall study population, and there were no notable differences for the B strains for the 
aQIV group compared with the QIV group. 
For  subjects  of  Hispanic  or  Latino  ethnicity,  the  small  number  of  subjects  in  this  ethnicity  category  (26 
subjects) for these analyses limits any conclusion for these observations. 
Immunogenicity Results by Comorbidity Risk Score 
For subjects with a comorbidity score <50 the results were consistent with the overall study results in that 
the Day 22 immune response was observed to be higher for the A/H1N1 strain and there were no notable

differences for the other 3 strains (A/H3N2 and B strains) for the aQIV group compared with the QIV group 
(see Table 18). 
In contrast, for subjects with a comorbidity risk score ≥50: The Day 22 immune response was observed to 
be higher for both A strains (GMTr [95% CI]: A/H1N1 – 0.73 [0.57, 0.93] and A/H3N2 – 0.73 [0.55, 0.98]) 
and the B/Yamagata (GMTr [95% CI]: 0.77 [0.64, 0.94]) strain for the aQIV group compared with the QIV 
group. 
There  were  no  notable  differences  in  immunogenicity  at  Day  22  for  aQIV  versus  QIV  for  the  B/Victoria 
strain.

by HI Assay by Comorbidity Risk Score (FAS Immunogenicity) 
Immunogenicity Results by Baseline HI titer 
For subjects with a baseline titer ≥1:10, the results were consistent with the overall study results in that 
the Day 22 immune response was observed to be higher for the A/H1N1 strain for the aQIV group 
compared with the QIV group and there were no notable differences in immunogenicity at Day 22 for 
aQIV versus QIV for the other 3 strains (A/H3N2 and B strains). 
In contrast, for subjects with a baseline HI titer <1:10: 
• 
• 
The Day 22 immune response was observed to be higher for the A/H1N1 strain (GMTr [95% 
CI]: 0.59 [0.45, 0.77]) for the aQIV group compared with the QIV group. 
The point estimate of the Day 22 GMT ratio for the A/H3N2 strain (0.76) was lower than that 
observed in the overall study population (0.91), but the 95% CI was wider due to the smaller 
sample size and crossed the value of 1. 
• 
There were no notable differences in immunogenicity at Day 22 for aQIV versus QIV for the 
B/Yamagata or B/Victoria strains. 
Overall, the subgroup analyses for the FAS Immunogenicity set regarding age, sex, race, ethnicity, previous 
vaccination history (received or not an influenza vaccination within the previous 3 influenza seasons) and 
comorbidity risk score were consistent with the overall study result. In fact, the Day 22 immune response 
was observed to be higher for the A/H1N1 strain for the aQIV group compared with the QIV group for each 
of the subgroups evaluated in the study. No notable differences in immunogenicity between aQIV and QIV

for the rest of the influenza strains was observed, with the exception that a higher Day 22 immune response 
for  aQIV  regarding  the  A/H3N2  strain  in  the  subgroup  of  subjects  who  had  not  received  an  influenza 
vaccination  within  the  previous  3  influenza  seasons,  and  for  the  A/H3N2  and  B/Yamagata  strains  in  the 
subgroup of subjects with a high comorbidity risk score (≥50). However, it is unclear the relevance of these 
differences since for these two analyses the GMT estimates determined for each of the subgroups compared 
have  wide  95%CI  and  these  CI  overlap  for  the  two  subgroups  analysed  within  the  two  analysis  made 
(previous history of vaccination and comorbidity score).

Notes 
The primary endpoint 1 bis was an analysis performed by the MAH including 
additional serum samples (less than 50) as compared to the analysis 
described for endpoint 1b. This analysis was made after knowing the results 
for the endpoint 1b. 
Analysis 
description 
Secondary analysis  
The secondary analyses were not performed since additional testing stopped 
after the success criterion for endpoint 1b was not met.  
Supportive studies 
During the assessment the MAH was asked to discuss other additional evidences to support extending the 
indication to subjects 50 to 64 YOA, as immunogenicity data gathered from other clinical trials performed 
with an influenza MF-59 adjuvanted vaccine, restricting the analysis to the population 50 to 64 YOA, 
immunogenicity data from other trials and effectiveness data with an influenza MF-59 adjuvanted vaccine 
but restricting the analysis to subjects with an age closer to the indication sought (e.g, subjects 65 to 70 
yoa or 65 to 75 yoa).  
As requested, the MAH provided data from RCTs and RWE studies in support of the benefit of the 
adjuvanted influenza vaccine in subjects from 50 to 64 yoa. 
Results from three RCT were provided: V7P38 (sponsored by Chiron vaccines), V70P3 (sponsor 
unknown), and a trial sponsored by a Public Health Italian academic group.  
In these three studies, immunogenicity results (in terms of HAI titres) obtained in subjects vaccinated 
with an MF-59 adjuvanted egg-based trivalent vaccine (aTIV) are compared to those reached following 
administration of a nonadjuvanted egg-based trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV). The studies were 
conducted in three different influenza seasons (NH 2000/01, NH 2006/07 and NH 2005/06). Study V7P38 
included subjects from 50 to 64 yoa; V70P3 recruited subjects from 18 to 60 yoa, and the MAH provided 
the immunogenicity results for the age subgroup 50 to 60 years; and the study from Baldo et al, included 
subjects from 18 to 60 yoa [mean age 51 y (standard deviation ± 12 y)]. No age subgroup analysis from 
this latter study is provided, and this was interpreted in the sense that the MAH did not have access to 
the original data of this academic study. Consistently, in the three studies a higher immune response (in 
terms of GMTs), against all three viral components, was observed for the adjuvanted vaccine as 
compared to the non-adjuvanted one. Moreover, this increase in GMT was statistically significant [i.e, the 
upper limit of the 95%CI of the GMTR (TIV vs aTIV) was lower than 1] for the three strains in trial V70P3 
and for two strains in trial V7P38 and in the study by Baldo et al1.

These studies were performed using an adjuvanted trivalent vaccine. However, considering that the 
manufacturing process and formulation of aQIV are the same as those of the adjuvanted trivalent 
influenza vaccine (aTIV, Fluad), with the exception of an additional B strain included in aQIV, it is 
considered that data obtained with aTIV can be used in support of extending the age indication for aQIV.  
The new data presented in response to the RSI raised, which compare the immune response of an aTIV 
vs a non-adjuvanted TIV, in subjects 50 to 64 yoa (trial V7P38), subjects 50 to 60 yoa (trial V70P3), and 
in the age group 18- 60 (Baldo et al,) also point out in the direction of a higher immunity induced by the 
adjuvanted vaccine. In fact, a statistically superior GMTR is demonstrated for the three strains in trial 
V70P3 and for two strains in trial V7P38 and in the study by Baldo et al.  
The MAH also provides results from three vaccine effectiveness studies: two retrospective cohort studies 
sponsored by Seqirus (described by Boikos et al. 2021, and Imran et al. 2022), and one public health 
surveillance study carried out by the United Kingdom Health Security Agency (UKHSA). The two 
retrospective cohort studies were conducted during the NH 2017/2018, 2018/2019, and 2019/2020 
influenza seasons to estimate the relative vaccine effectiveness of adjuvanted egg-based trivalent 
influenza vaccine (aTIV) versus a nonadjuvanted egg-based standard-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine 
(QIV) or versus a nonadjuvanted egg-based high-dose trivalent influenza vaccine (HD-TIV) in preventing

influenza-related medical encounters (IRMEs) in individuals ≥65 years of age. The two studies used the 
same USA integrated dataset comprising de-identified (anonymous) data from electronic medical records 
from primary care and specialty clinics linked with pharmacy and medical claims. As requested, the MAH 
describes vaccine effectiveness results particularly for the age group 65 to 74 years, which is the closest 
one to the sought age indication of 50 to 64 years. In these studies, the relative vaccine effectiveness of 
aTIV vs QIV for the prevention of IRMEs significantly favoured aTIV in the overall study population (≥65 
years of age). Specifically, for the 65-74 years age subgroup, a benefit was observed for aTIV compared 
with QIV, with the relative vaccine effectiveness ranging from 15.5% (95% CI: 12.0 to 19.0) to 26.2% 
(95% CI: 23.3 to 29.0) across the 2017-2020 influenza seasons. Similarly, for the age subgroup of 65-74 
years, aTIV demonstrated a higher or comparable benefit to a HD-TIV in the 3 influenza seasons.  
Figure 2: Relative vaccine effectiveness of aTIV (aIIV3) vs QIV (IIV4) for the prevention of 
influenza-related medical encounters during the 3 influenza seasons between 2017 and 2020 
in subjects ≥65 years of age and by age subgroup (65-74 years, 75-84 years, and ≥85 years). 
It is noted that the comparison of aTIV vs QIV involves comparing a trivalent vs a quadrivalent vaccine, 
and despite this fact, the trivalent vaccine shows higher vaccine effectiveness. One of the factors that 
most likely influenced this result is that the B/Yamagata strain (present only in QIV) was not predominant 
during any of the three influenza seasons analysed. 
The evidence presented in these studies supports the idea of an increased effectiveness of aTIV vs non-
adjunvanted vaccines in terms of reduction of influenza-related office visits among the elderly.  It is 
noted, however, that the results from two of the mentioned retrospective cohort studies (HEOR 17-18 
and HEOR 18-19) were assessed in the context of the variation procedure EMEA/H/C/004993/II/0003. It 
was stated then that an important weakness of these studies is that none of them used influenza-
confirmed cases as primary effectiveness outcome, which is the preferred endpoint for influenza VE 
studies.

Vaccine effectiveness data from the MF-59 adjuvanted quadrivalent vaccine (aQIV) based on RT-PCR 
confirmed influenza cases were provided in the study carried out by the UKHSA during the NH 2022/2023 
influenza season. The study analysed vaccine effectiveness of aQIV against influenza hospitalization and 
against influenza disease (based on data from primary care sentinel surveillance system). Two sources of 
laboratory-confirmed influenza hospital outcomes were used (the respiratory DataMart and the Second 
generation Surveillance System –SGSS-). This study provides data on prevention of hospitalization not 
only for the 65-74 years of age group but also for the age group 50 to 64 yoa. These latter data appear 
to derive from adults aged 50-64 that received aQIV off label and outside of national recommendations. 
Data from primary care sentinel surveillance systems showed an adjusted vaccine effectiveness against 
outpatient laboratory-confirmed influenza of 23% (95% CI: -34 to 56) in the 65-74 years age group. 
Since the % CI includes zero, these data do not show evidence of vaccine effectiveness in that particular 
season. However, using the outcome of laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalisation, the adjusted 
vaccine effectiveness for aQIV was 40% (95% CI: 19 to 55) (data from the Respiratory DataMart system) 
and 25% (95% CI: 16 to 34) (data from the SGSS) in the 65-74 years age group. Results from the SGSS 
for the 50-64 years age group also demonstrated an adjusted vaccine effectiveness for aQIV against 
laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalisation of 34% (95% CI: 8 to 53). Although the study made by the 
UKHSA does not compare an adjuvanted vs a nonadjuvanted vaccine, the results obtained show 
significant vaccine effectiveness of aQIV against laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalisation in the 50-
64 and in the 65-74 years of age group.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Introduction 
Fluad Tetra (aQIV) is authorised in the EU, from May 2020, for subjects older than 65 YOA. This quadrivalent 
influenza vaccine contains 15 μg hemagglutinin (HA) of each influenza virus strain, including both A/H1N1 
and  A/H3N2  strains  and  strains  of  both  B  lineages.  The  vaccine  is  an  egg-derived,  inactivated,  MF-59-
adjuvanted vaccine that shows  an increased  immunogenicity  in  subjects older  than 65  YOA.  The  clinical 
development  program  to  support  registration  of  the  quadrivalent  vaccine  builds  upon  the  development 
program of the trivalent version of the vaccine (aTIV), which was licensed for use in persons 65 years of 
age and older in Europe in 1997. 
Considering the public health impact of severe disease caused by influenza infection in the age group 50-
64 YOA (particularly in those with certain comorbidities), it is acknowledged that the MAH decided to carry 
out study V118_23 to assess the benefits and risks of this adjuvanted vaccine in this age group, in order 
to support registration of aQIV for use in persons from 50 years of age. 
The MAH states that the design of the study is consistent with the EMA Guideline on Influenza Vaccines 
(EMA 2016) and with the CBER Guidance for Industry: Clinical Data Needed to Support the Licensure of 
Seasonal Inactivated Influenza Vaccines (CBER 2007).  
The MAH did not seek Scientific advice at the CHMP. 
The  current  data  package  includes  data  from  Study  V118_23,  a  randomized,  comparator-controlled, 
observer-blind, multicenter study to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of aQIV versus a licensed non-
adjuvanted QIV comparator (QIV) in subjects 50 to 64 years of age. The non-inferiority and superiority of 
the immune response of aQIV compared with QIV were evaluated in a sequential manner. The clinical trial 
V118_23 was performed in accordance with GCP, as indicated by the MAH. 
The MAH indicated that there is a planned clinical disease endpoint study with aQIV to be conducted as part 
of a post marketing requirement following FDA’s initial approval of Fluad Quadrivalent under accelerated 
approval  regulations:  Study  V118_24  –  A  Phase  3/3b,  Randomized,  Observer-blind,  Multicenter  Clinical 
Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety, and Immunogenicity of an MF59-Adjuvanted Quadrivalent Subunit 
Inactivated Influenza Vaccine Compared to a Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine in Adults ≥65 Years of Age. 
The MAH committed to submit to EMA the results of this trial when available.   
Main study V118_23 
Methods 
The  use  of  the  Hemagglutination  Inhibition  (HI)  assay  as  the  primary  assay  to  assess  vaccine 
immunogenicity is in agreement with the recommendations of the Guideline on Influenza Vaccines (Non-
clinical  and  clinical  module)  (EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014).  It  is  also  considered  adequate  that  serum 
samples were analysed for HI titres both at baseline (before vaccination) and at day 21 post-vaccination. 
In agreement with the CHMP guideline, all samples were tested for HI antibodies at one central laboratory 
(Viroclinics  Biosciences  BV,  Rotterdam,  The  Netherlands).  The  data  submitted  support  the  adequate 
validation of the HI assay.  
The vaccine tested in trial V118_23 contains the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigen from four viral strains 
grown in eggs, and the adjuvant MF-59. The dose (0.5 ml) of 15 μg HA per viral strain is in agreement with 
the Eur. Ph. requirements. This same composition is the one currently approved for use in subjects 65 YOA 
and older, and it is also noted that most of the inactivated influenza vaccines used in the EU contain also 
15 μg HA (in 0.5 ml) per viral strain. Thus, it makes sense that the MAH tested the same formulation for 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

subjects  50-64  YOA  than  the  one  currently  approved  for  ≥65YOA,  without  performing  additional  dose 
finding studies. 
The  study  participants  were  individuals  50  to  64  years  of  age  (i.e.  50  to  ≤64  years),  and  subjects  with 
controlled clinical conditions were allowed to participate in the trial. Those with abnormal function of the 
immune  system  were  excluded.  This  approach  is  endorsed  since  it  allows  inclusion  of  subjects  with 
comorbidities that put them at a higher risk of influenza complications.  
It  is  noted  that  the  MAH  has  used  a  comorbidity  risk  score,  which  is  a  validated  predictor  of  risk  of 
complications from influenza in elderly subjects (65 years of age and older); a score of <50 is considered 
low risk and a score of ≥50 is considered high risk of complications from influenza (Hak et al. 2004). The   
comorbidity risk score assessment incorporates medical comorbidity and other baseline characteristics such 
as age, gender, outpatient visits during the previous year and previous hospitalizations due to pneumonia 
or  influenza.  This  approach  is  considered  acceptable  although  routinely,  to  assess  the  impact  of 
comorbidities  on  immune  response  induced  by  vaccination,  the  subjects  are  classified  in  those  with  or 
without underlying chronic conditions (that put them at risk of severe influenza disease),  without taking 
into account other baseline characteristics. 
Differences in strain composition are noted for two out of the four strains in the two vaccines (aQIV and 
QIV)  used  in  the  pivotal  trial  (namely,  H3N2  and  B/Victoria  strains).  It  is  acknowledged  that  both 
formulations are in accordance with WHO and CHMP recommendations for quadrivalent influenza vaccines 
contemporaneous to the timing of the study, season 2021-2022. The MAH was asked to comment on the 
possible impact on the HI results obtained due to using two vaccines with different composition (regarding 
strains H3 and B/Victoria) in trial V118_23.  The MAH provided a satisfactory answer and it is considered 
that this issue has no major implications in the results obtained. However, it should be noted that the actual 
impact of using the vaccine strains in the HAI assay on the measured immune responses is not known, and 
thus, a biased GMT ratio estimate could not be formally excluded. Given that NI is clearly demonstrated 
(see  below),  it  is  however  agreed  that  this  should  probably  not  have  major  implications  for  the  NI 
conclusion. 
It is noted that aQIV is a subunit vaccine, whereas the comparator (QIV) is a split vaccine.  
Objectives 
In trial V118_23, there is no clinical efficacy endpoint, but only immunological endpoints. This approach 
was  considered  acceptable,  in  agreement  with  current  influenza  virus  vaccines  guideline  (Guideline  on 
influenza vaccines – non-clinical and clinical Module -EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014). 
Immune response against the four homologous egg-derived vaccine strains was measured in terms of: 1) 
GMT  of  HI  antibodies  (on  Day  1,  Day  22,  for  the  primary  analysis,  and  also  titers  at  Day  181  for  some 
secondary  analysis,  and  2)    SCR  (seroconversion  rate):  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  either  a 
prevaccination HI titre <1:10 and a postvaccination HI titre ≥1:40 or a prevaccination titre ≥1:10 and a ≥4-
fold increase in postvaccination titer (measured on Day 22 and Day 181). The use of GMT of HI antibodies 
and  SCRs  are  considered  adequate  to  compare  the  immune  response  induced  by  the  two  vaccines.  The 
definition used for SCR is also considered adequate and it has been used in many other immunogenicity 
comparisons between influenza vaccines. Moreover, the definition of SCR was in fact the definition already 
mentioned in a previous CHMP guideline (Note for guidance on harmonization of requirements for influenza 
vaccines –CPMP/BWP/214/96), which is no longer in use.  
The MAH establishes two primary objectives: The first one (1a) involves demonstration of non-inferiority of 
aQIV compared to QIV, for each of the four viral strains, in terms of HI GMT ratio (four comparisons, one 
per  viral  strain  included  in  the  vaccine)  and  the  SCR  difference  (four  comparisons,  one  per  viral  strain 
included in the vaccines). Non-inferiority will be demonstrated if the upper limit (UL) of the 95% confidence 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/533902/2023 
Page 55/85 
 
 
 
 
interval (CI) for the inter-group GMT ratio (QIV/aQIV) is ≤1.5 for each vaccine strain, and the UL of the 
95% CI for the difference in SCR2 (QIV – aQIV) is ≤10% for each vaccine strain. The approach taken for 
endpoint 1a as well as the non-inferiority margins chosen are considered acceptable and are in line with 
those used in previous influenza vaccine immunogenicity comparisons. 
The second primary endpoint (1b) is aimed at demonstrating that aQIV induces a superior immune response 
compared with QIV as measured by HI GMTs at 3 weeks after vaccination for at least 2 of the 4 vaccine 
strains. The success criterion is that superior immune response will be demonstrated if the UL of the 95% 
CI for the inter-group GMT ratio (QIV/aQIV) is <1.0 for at least 2 of the 4 vaccine strains. 
It  is  noted  that  the  current  guideline  on  influenza  vaccines  (non-clinical  and  clinical  module 
EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014) states: 
-“Alternatively, subject to adequate justification, Applicants could choose to conduct an active controlled 
study  i.e.  in  which  the  control  vaccine  is  an  approved  influenza  vaccine.  In  this  case  the  study  may  be 
designed to show superiority of the test vaccine over an authorised product (e.g. an adjuvanted vaccine 
vs.  a  non-adjuvanted  vaccine).  Depending  on  the  characteristics  of  the  test  vaccine  and  of  the  selected 
comparator, and subject to adequate justifications, it may be acceptable to plan a primary analysis based 
on showing non-inferior efficacy. The choice of non-inferiority margins should be appropriately justified by 
the Applicant. 
“To authorise the use of a new adjuvanted surface antigen vaccine in adults and/or the elderly an advantage 
in terms of immune responses is required to justify the inclusion of an adjuvant. Such advantage may be 
based  on  a  demonstration  of  superior  immunogenicity  vs.  a  non-adjuvanted  but  otherwise  comparable 
authorised vaccine that has been reviewed by EU competent regulatory authorities. An advantage for the 
adjuvanted  vs.  non-adjuvanted  formulation  could  include  a  higher  seroconversion  rate,  higher  antibody 
titres  (based  on  GMTs  or  proportions  reaching  a  predefined  cut-off  titre)  or  other  immune  response 
parameters, including increased breadth or duration of response.” 
Taking into consideration the previous statements from the CHMP influenza vaccines guideline, the 
approach taken by the MAH that requires meeting the two primary objectives (non-inferiority and 
superiority) to support approval of aQIV for subjects from 50 to 64 YOA is considered acceptable. 
However, the CHMP guideline on influenza vaccines does not specify if superiority needs to be 
demonstrated for all four influenza strains, but it is considered that the endpoint proposed by the MA is 
poorly demanding, since it only requires demonstration of superiority in terms of GMT ratio for at least 2 
of the 4 vaccine strains. It is considered that optimally, superiority of aQIv vs QIV in terms of GMT ratio 
should have been demonstrated for the four viral strains to robustly demonstrate the role of the adjuvant 
in terms of inducing an increase of the immune response in comparison with a non-adjuvanted vaccine.  
Thus, the MAH was asked to justify the success criterion for primary endpoint 1b (aimed to demonstrate 
increased immune response of aQIv vs QIV) that requires showing superiority for at least two of the 4 
viral strains, when optimally superiority should have been demonstrated for the four viral strains. The 
MAH indicated that responses to influenza vaccine strains show high variability across seasons and by 
strain; in particular, influenza B vaccine strains in recent years have been less immunogenic. Accordingly, 
a success criterion of at least 2 of the 4 viral strains being superior to the comparator vaccine represents 
a clinically meaningful benefit. 
Although it is agreed that responses to influenza vaccine strains show high variability across seasons and 
by  strain,  it  is  unclear  why  this  fact  should  impact  on  not  achieving  superiority  of  the  MF59  adjuvanted 
vaccine against all four viral components. Certainly, a success superiority criterion of at least 2 of the 4 
viral  implies  a clinical benefit,  but this benefit, as compared to  a non-adjuvanted vaccine,  disappears in 
seasons  in  which  the  predominant  circulating  strains  are  those  which  show  the  same  immune  response 
wherever the vaccine is adjuvanted or not.

Altogether the data provided are considered sufficient to approve the current variation procedure, and thus 
this issue related to this question is not further pursued.  
There are two secondary objectives (2a and 2b), that involved determining GMT ratio (QIV/aQIV) at Day 
22  (2a)  and  181  (2b)  for  the  four  strains  included  in  the  vaccine.  In  relation  to  endpoint  2a,  Superior 
immune response of aQIV compared to QIV will be demonstrated if the UL of the 98.73% CI for the inter-
group GMT ratio (QIV/aQIV) is <0.67 for one or more vaccine strains. Objective 2b, to demonstrate greater 
persistence of the immune response for at least one vaccine strain at 6 months after vaccination, being the 
success criteria “Greater persistence of the immune response will be demonstrated if the UL of the 98.73% 
CI for the inter-group GMT ratio (QIV/aQIV) is <1.0 for one or more vaccine strains.” 
Although the analysis of objectives 2a and 2b uses a higher threshold for superiority than that assessed in 
objective 1b, it is questioned the relevance of this objective from the point of view of the overall increased  
clinical protection provided by aQIV, since endpoint 2a can just be reached by showing superiority to only 
one of the four viral strains. Similarly, meeting the secondary objective 2b (greater persistence of immune 
response)  can  be  met  by  just  showing  greater  persistence  of  immune  response  to  just  one  of  the  four 
strains.  
Endpoint 2c is aimed to evaluate the immunogenicity of aQIV compared with QIV as measured by HI as 
follows: GMT of HI antibodies on Day 1, Day 22, and Day 181; Geometric mean fold increase (GMFI): the 
geometric mean of the fold increase of postvaccination HI titre over the prevaccination HI titre (Day 22/Day 
1, Day 181/Day 1), and the percentage of subjects with a titre ≥1:40 at Day 1, Day 22, and Day 181. This 
endpoint does not imply any hypothesis testing.  
Exploratory objectives include persistence of the immune response of aQIV compared to QIV at day 271 as 
determined  by  HI  assays,  and  assessment  of  the  immunogenicity  against  homologous  or  heterologous 
strains by either HI or microneutralization. The MAH indicated that neutralization testing was an exploratory 
objective and that is currently not planned to be conducted.  Results on persistence of immune response 
at day 271 were provided upon request by the MAH. The new data do not alter the conclusions stated in 
the first assessments report.   
The  sample  size  of  2018  subjects  has  been  calculated  to  achieve  a  90%  power  based  on  the  primary 
endpoints: non-inferiority of GMT and SCR of aQIV vs QIV for all strains and superiority of GMT of aQIV vs 
QIV for at least 2/4 vaccine strains with a one-sided alpha of 2.5%. The assumptions for both endpoints 
and for each strain are based on the results from a similar study comparing trivalent Influenza vaccines 
(V7P38).  This  calculation  takes  into  account  a  dropout  rate  of  10%.  The  assumptions  and  operating 
characteristics  of  the  sample  size  estimation  are  well  described.  The  operating  characteristics  meet 
regulatory requirements and the sample size calculations appear adequate.  
Enrolled subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either aQIV or QIV with age (50 to ≤59 years/60 
to ≤64 years) and history of any influenza vaccination within the previous 3 influenza seasons (yes/no) as 
stratification factors. Stratification according to age was considered adequate.  A clarification is asked to 
the MAH in relation to stratification according to “history of any influenza vaccination within the previous 3 
influenza seasons (yes/no)”. The MAH was asked to elaborate on the rationale to consider as a stratification 
factor “any influenza vaccination within the previous 3 influenza seasons” rather than “influenza vaccination 
in the previous influenza season”. This issue was solved and the MAH also indicated that the majority of 
subjects reported as previously vaccinated received their influenza vaccine in the year just prior to the year 
of study conduct (81% of subjects).  
The study was an observer-blind study. During the treatment period of the study, designated and trained 
personnel were responsible for preparing and administering the study vaccines to the subjects. They were 
instructed not to reveal the identity of the study vaccines to the subject or to the investigative site personnel 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/533902/2023 
Page 57/85 
 
 
 
 
(blinded  study  personnel)  involved  in  the  monitoring  of  conduct  of  the  trial.  Thus,  the  observer-blind 
strategy is considered acceptable taking into account that the comparator vaccine is a commercial vaccine. 
Statistical methods 
The  different  populations  sets  (including  those  using  for  primary  analysis:  Full  Analysis  Set  (FAS) 
Immunogenicity and Per Protocol Set (PPS) Immunogenicity, used for analysis are considered adequate.  
The approach proposed by the MAH implies: 1) using the FAS immunogenicity for testing the objective 1b, 
and for testing the sensitivity analyses regarding objective 1a; 2) using the PPS immunogenicity for the 
objective 1a, and for the sensitive analysis regarding objective 1b. This approach is considered in line with 
the  guideline 
(Points 
to  Consider  on  Switching  between  Superiority  and  Non-Inferiority 
(CPMP/EWP/482/99)) and thus is considered acceptable. 
The Applicant strategy to handle multiplicity and to control the type I error is based on a hierarchical testing 
approach.  The  first  comparisons  tested  (primary  objective  1a),  correspond  to  co-primary  non-inferiority 
hypotheses  where,  if  the  GMT  ratio  and  the  SCR  difference  are  significant  for  all  strains  in  the  PPS 
population, then the primary objective 1b will be tested. For the latter, the GMT ratio is tested and efficacy 
is declared if in at least 2 out of 4 strains results are significant. The rest of secondary objective (2a and 
2b) are tested hierarchically after the previous primary objectives, if applicable, for superiority for at least 
1 strain and persistence for at least 1 strain with the α-adjusted CI. This approach is considered acceptable. 
Overall, the primary statistical methods for both primary endpoints are endorsed.  
Results 
Two protocol amendments were made during the study. Overall, the modifications made to the protocol 
were  not  considered  to  introduce  major  changes  to  the  original  design  of  the  trial  and  importantly,  the 
protocol amendments were made while the study was still blinded. 
In relation to the planned analysis, in the first analysis made by the MAH, the HI data used for the primary 
and secondary immunogenicity analyses excluded a number of samples (named “NRR-inconsistent” by the 
testing laboratory – Viroclincs-) from these analyses. These samples corresponded to 45 subjects across 
the 4 vaccine strains (A/H1N1: 25 subjects; A/H3N2: 11 subjects; B/Yamagata: 6 subjects; B/Victoria: 10 
subjects).  Although  according  to  the  Viroclinics  SOP,  these  samples  could  have  been  retested,  the  MAH 
decided not to include these samples in the initial analyses for the primary objectives since they had enough 
number of samples considering that the target enrolment levels had been exceeded and the dropout rate 
was smaller than anticipated.   
After database lock and the initial statistical analysis of the primary study objectives (that resulted in not 
meeting  the  superiority  primary  endpoint,  as  described  below),  the  MAH  decided  to  retest  (in  a  blinded 
manner)  the  “NRR-inconsistent”  serum  samples.  The  primary  and  secondary  analyses  were  then 
recalculated taken into account these new additional samples (analysis on the complete serology dataset). 
As  further  discussed  below,  the  MAH  conducted  a  post-hoc  sensitivity  analysis  based  on  the  “Complete 
Serology Dataset”. From a methodological and statistical point of view, this post-hoc sensitivity analysis 
can never replace or rescue the main analysis, as there is no free alpha for confirmatory testing. In fact, 
this analysis will be considered exploratory only and no confirmatory claims can be made from these tests. 
The MAH indicates that the additional samples included in the complete serology dataset corresponded to 
45 subjects across the 4 vaccine strains. For clarification, it is asked to the MAH to detail in a Table the 
number of samples analysed regarding primary endpoint 1b, for the first analysis and for the analysis based 
on the complete serology dataset for each of the four viral strains. The data should also include the number 
of samples analysed at the different time points (day 1, day 21 and day 181). The MAH should also confirm 
that all “NRR-Inconsistent “samples provided satisfactory results after re-analysis.

The  study  population  (N=2044)  was  slightly  larger  than  the  planned  sample  size  of  2018  subjects. 
Importantly, a large proportion of the enrolled subjects completed the study (95.5% of the aQIV arm and 
97.2% of the QIV arm). The small difference between the two arms is due to a higher number of subjects 
“lost to follow-up” (3.4% -aQIV- vs 1.7% -QIV).  
Similarly, a large proportion (99.9%) of the subjects included in the “all enrolled set” were also included in 
the “FAS immunogenicity”. A slightly lower percentage (96.2%) of the “all enrolled set” were included in 
the “PPS immunogenicity”. The reasons for subjects being excluded from the “PPS immunogenicity” were 
similar in the two treatment arms, being the most common reason for exclusion “protocol deviation” (“did 
not comply with blood draw schedule”, and “serological tests not available”). Within this category (“protocol 
deviation”)  there  was  a  difference  of  0.8%  (16  subjects)  vs  1.6%  (8  subjects)  between  the  two  arms 
regarding the concept: “subject does not meet at least 1 inclusion or exclusion criteria”.  
It is noted that the evaluable subjects after protocol deviations and exclusions meet the estimated sample 
size for 90% of power to demonstrate the two primary endpoints (non-inferiority and superiority).  
Based on all the above comments, there is no reason to question the integrity of the trial. 
The study was conducted in Estonia (787 subjects), Germany (513 subjects), and the US (744 subjects). 
All subjects were recruited on the Northern Hemisphere 2021/2022 influenza season. The mean age of the 
All Enrolled Set was 57.8 years (SD: 4.19), with a range of 50 to 64 years, consistent with the intended 
study population. It is noted that more subjects (59%) were enrolled in the 50 to 59 years age cohort than 
in the 60 to 64 years age cohort (41%). Similarly, there more females (61%) than males (39%) enrolled 
in the trial. It is considered that these differences have no relevant impact in the results obtained in the 
trial. 
Importantly, there are no notable differences in the distribution of demographic and baseline characteristics 
between the aQIV and QIV vaccine groups. Overall, the population included in the trial reflects the intended 
indication sought by the MAH. 
The  MAH  provided  information  on  the  number  of  subjects  that  received  an  influenza  vaccination  in  the 
previous three seasons.  For completeness of the information the MAH provided information on the number 
of subjects in each arm that received a previous influenza vaccination in just the last season. It was clarified 
that 1184 subjects reported “yes” to previous influenza vaccination in the previous 3 seasons, the majority 
(959 subjects, 81%) reported having been vaccinated in the influenza season just prior to when the study 
was conducted in the NH 2021/2022 influenza season.  
All  8  primary  non-inferiority  endpoints  (Study  Objective  1a)  were  met  in  the  PPS  Immunogenicity  first 
analysis: 
-The UL of the 95% CI for the GMT ratio (QIV/aQIV) was below the noninferiority margin of 1.5 for 
all 4 vaccine strains (A/H1N1: 0.87; A/H3N2: 0.99; B/Yamagata: 1.01; B/Victoria: 1.07).  
-The UL of the 95% CI for the SCR difference (QIV – aQIV) was below the noninferiority margin of 
10% for all 4 vaccine strains (A/H1N1: -0.89%; A/H3N2: 2.52%; B/Yamagata: 2.22%; B/Victoria: 
0.87%). 
Similarly, the 8 primary non-inferiority endpoints (Study Objective 1a) were met in the PPS immunogenicity 
when using the complete serology dataset.  
A sensitivity analyses performed in the FAS immunogenicity (both the initial analysis and that performed 
on the complete serology dataset) yielded again the same results (i.e, all 8 primary non-inferiority endpoints 
were met). 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/533902/2023 
Page 59/85 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In  conclusion,  the  pre-specified  success  criteria  for  Study  Objective  1a  were  met,  and  thus  the  non-
inferiority of aQIV compared with QIV in subjects 50 to 64 years of age was concluded. 
In relation to objective 1b, in the FAS Immunogenicity first analysis, the UL of the 95% CI for the adjusted 
inter-group Day 22 GMT ratio was: 
-Below the superiority margin of 1.0 for the A/H1N1 strain (0.87). 
-Above the superiority margin of 1.0 for the B/Yamagata (1.01) and B/Victoria (1.08) 
strains; and the superiority margin was marginally exceeded for the A/H3N2 strain (1.002). 
As the UL of the 95% CI in the first analysis was below the superiority margin of 1.0 for only 1 of the 4 
vaccine strains (A/H1N1), the prespecified success criterion for demonstrating a superior immune 
response for aQIV compared with QIV was not met in subjects 50 to 64 years of age. 
When the analysis was performed in the FAS Immunogenicity (complete serology dataset), the UL of the 
95% CI for the adjusted inter-group Day 22 GMT ratio was below the protocol specified superiority margin 
of 1.0 for two of the four strains [A/H1N1 (0.88) and A/H3N2 (0.998)]. Thus in this analysis, a superior 
immune response was observed for aQIV vs QIV for 2 of the 4 vaccine strains. 
The  sensitivity  analysis  performed  in  the  PPS  for  immunogenicity  (both  the  first  analysis  and  the  one 
performed in the complete serology dataset) demonstrated superiority of aQIV compared to QIV for two 
(A/H1N1 and A/H3N2) of the four vaccine strains. 
In summary, the planned primary efficacy objective consisting of the two primary endpoints, 1a (the non-
inferiority of the GMT ratio and the SCR difference for all strains in the PPS set), and 1b (the superiority in 
at least 2 out of 4 strains in the GMT ratio in the FAS population) was not fulfilled. Specifically, while the 
non-inferiority test for objective 1a achieved statistical significance, the superiority assessment of the GMT 
ratio was not met as only one strain (A/H1N1) fulfilled the predefined superiority criteria. Notably, as this 
primary objective was not met, any further testing will not maintain Type I error control and will therefore 
be considered only exploratory and no confirmatory claims can be made from these tests. 
The MAH conducted a post-hoc sensitivity analyses based on the “Complete Serology Dataset”, and then, 
and additional strain (A/H3N2) was shown to be significant. The MAH then stated that the study should be 
considered as positive. From a methodological and statistical point of view, this post-hoc sensitivity analysis 
can never replace or rescue the main analysis, as there is no free alpha for confirmatory testing. 
In conclusion, the study failed to meet all of the planned primary objectives. The results from trial V118_23 
(in subjects 50 to 64 yoa), which are the basis for this variation application, demonstrated non-inferiority 
of aQIV vs QIV (in terms of SCR differences and GMT titres) for all four viral strains. The estimates of GMT 
titres and SRC rates were always higher for those receiving aQIV than those that received QIV. However, 
this  increase  in  the  immune  response  elicited  by  the  adjuvanted  vaccine  did  only  translate,  in  the  first 
immunogenicity  analysis,  in  showing  superiority  (in  terms  of  GMTR)  against  one  viral  strain  (H1N1), 
although it is noted that the results for A/H3N2 strain marginally exceeded the predefined criterion.  An 
additional  post-hoc  analysis  (“complete  serology  set”)  which  incorporated  additional  serum  samples, 
showed superior immune response of aQIV versus QIV for 2 of the 4 vaccine strains.   The MAH provided 
new data that include the results from three RCTs and from retrospective cohort studies and public health 
surveillance.  
The  new  data  presented,  which  compare  the  immune  response  of  an  aTIV  vs  a  non-adjuvanted  TIV,  in 
subjects 50 to 64 yoa (trial V7P38), subjects 50 to 60 yoa (trial V70P3), and in the age group 18- 60 (Baldo 
et al, 2007) also point out in the direction of a higher immunity induced by the adjuvanted vaccine. In fact, 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/533902/2023 
Page 60/85 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
consistently,  in  the  three  RCTs  a  higher  immune  response  (in  terms  of  GMTs),  against  all  three  viral 
components, was observed for the adjuvanted vaccine as compared to the non-adjuvanted one. It is noted 
that this increase in GMT was statistically significant [i.e, the upper limit of the 95%CI of the GMTR (TIV vs 
aTIV) was lower than 1] for the three strains in trial V70P3 and for two strains in trial V7P38 and in the 
study by Baldo et al.  
Moreover, the MAH provided evidence from retrospective cohort studies and one public health surveillance 
study (carried out by the United Kingdom Health Security Agency  –UKHSA-) that also indicate adequate 
vaccine effectiveness of the MF-59 adjuvanted vaccine in the 50-64 and in the 65-74 years age group. This 
latter age group is the closest one to the sought age indication of 50 to 64 years. In the retrospective cohort 
studies, the relative vaccine effectiveness of aTIV vs QIV for the prevention of influenza-related medical 
encounters favoured aTIV.  Specifically, for the 65-74 years age subgroup, a benefit was observed for aTIV 
compared with QIV, with the relative vaccine effectiveness ranging from 15.5% (95% CI: 12.0 to 19.0) to 
26.2% (95% CI: 23.3 to 29.0) across the 2017-2020 influenza seasons. Regarding the UKHSA study, when 
using the outcome of laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalisation, the adjusted vaccine effectiveness for 
aQIV  ranged  from  25%  (95% CI:  16 to 34)  to  40% (95% CI:  19  to 55) in  the  65-74 years age group. 
Moreover, results for the 50-64 years age group demonstrated an adjusted vaccine effectiveness for aQIV 
against laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalisation of 34% (95% CI: 8 to 53).  
Collectively, and despite the limitations of some of these data, it is concluded that all evidence provided is 
sufficient to support approval, from the efficacy point of view, of the current variation procedure that seeks 
extending the indication to the 50-64 years age group. 
The  MAH  followed  a  hierarchical  testing  approach  so  as  soon  as  any  success  criterion  is  not  met, 
confirmatory testing will stop. Thus, since Study Objective 1b was not met, confirmatory testing stopped 
and thus analysis of superiority of aQIV versus QIV at the higher superiority margin of 0.67 (at day 22: 
Study Objective 2a, and at day 181 GMTs: study objective 2b) was not conducted.  
The descriptive data corresponding to endpoint 2c did not provide any new relevant information. In fact, 
the results were in line with those shown regarding endpoints 1a and 1b. In fact, both at Day 22 and at 
day  181,  the  HI  GMT  and  GMFI  were  observed  to  be  higher  for  the  A/H1N1  strain  in  the  aQIV  group 
compared with the QIV group and there were no notable differences in HI GMTs and GMFIs between the 
two vaccine groups for the A/H3N2, B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria strains. Similarly, at day 22, there were 
no notable differences in the SCRs between the aQIV and QIV groups for any of the 4 vaccine strains. 
Overall, the subgroup analyses for the FAS Immunogenicity set regarding age, sex, race, ethnicity, previous 
vaccination history (received or not an influenza vaccination within the previous 3 influenza seasons) and 
comorbidity risk score were consistent with the overall study result. In fact, the Day 22 immune response 
was observed to be higher for the A/H1N1 strain for the aQIV group compared with the QIV group for each 
of the subgroups evaluated in the study. No notable differences in immunogenicity between aQIV and QIV 
for the rest of the influenza strains was observed, with the exception that a higher Day 22 immune response 
for  aQIV  regarding  the  A/H3N2  strain  in  the  subgroup  of  subjects  who  had  not  received  an  influenza 
vaccination  within  the  previous  3  influenza  seasons,  and  for  the  A/H3N2  and  B/Yamagata  strains  in  the 
subgroup of subjects with a high comorbidity risk score (≥50). However, it is unclear the relevance of these 
differences since for these two analyses, the GMT estimates determined for each of the  subgroups have 
wide 95%CI and these CI overlap for the two subgroups analysed within the two analysis made (previous 
history of vaccination and comorbidity score).

2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Study  V118_23 was a randomized,  comparator-controlled,  observer-blind,  multicenter  study  to evaluate 
the immunogenicity and safety of aQIV versus a licensed non-adjuvanted QIV comparator (QIV) in subjects 
50 to 64 years of age. The non-inferiority and superiority of the immune response of aQIV compared with 
QIV were evaluated in a sequential manner.  
Non-inferiority of aQIV vs QIV in terms of SCR differences and GMT titres was demonstrated for the four 
influenza  viral  strains  (primary  endpoint  1a).  However,  the  primary  endpoint  1b  that  required 
demonstrating superior response of aQIV in terms of GMT for at least 2 of the influenza viral strains was 
not met. The additional post-hoc analysis regarding endpoint 1b, that showed superior immune response 
of aQIV versus QIV for 2 of the 4 vaccine strains (A/H1N1 and A/H3N2), was not considered valid in principle 
to rescue the first failed analysis from a methodological and statistical point of view.  
The MAH provided new data that include the results from three RCTs and from retrospective cohort studies 
and public health surveillance. The RCTs compare the immune response of an MF-59 adjuvanted trivalent 
influenza vaccine vs a non-adjuvanted one, and the results indicate overall a higher immune response of 
the  MF-59  adjuvanted  vaccines  compared  to  the  non-adjuvanted  ones  in  the  age  group  50  to  64  yoa. 
Moreover, evidence from retrospective cohort studies and public health surveillance also indicate adequate 
vaccine effectiveness of the MF-59 adjuvanted vaccine in the 50-64 and in the 65-74 years age group. This 
latter age group is the closest one to the sought age indication of 50 to 64 years. Collectively, and despite 
the  limitations  of  some  of  these  data,  it  is  concluded  that  all  evidence  provided  is  sufficient  to  support 
approval,  from  the  efficacy  point  of  view,  of  the  current  variation  procedure  that  seeks  extending  the 
indication to the 50-64 years age group. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The  vaccine  aQIV  is  an  egg-derived  inactivated  subunit  quadrivalent  influenza  virus  vaccine  adjuvanted 
with MF59 authorised in the EU for use in adults aged 65 years and over. 
Overall, the aQIV safety profile in elderly adults (≥65 years of age) would be in general comparable to that 
of the aTIV comparators and no safety signal has been observed in this population.  
The aim of this variation (EMEA/H/C/004993/II/0043) was the registration of aQIV for use in persons 50 
years of age and older based on the data generated in clinical study V118_23. 
Patient exposure 
The Overall Safety Set is the same as All Enrolled Set and it included 2043 participants, of these 1027 
participants received aQIV and 1016 participants received QIV.  
Demographic and baseline characteristics 
The mean age of the Overall Safety Set was 57.8 years.  The study intended to enrol approximately 50% 
of  subjects  per  age  cohort;  however,  more  subjects  were  enrolled  in  the  50  to  ≤59  years  of  age  cohort 
(59.0%) than the 60 to ≤64 years of age cohort (41.0%). 
More  female  subjects  (61.2%)  than  male  subjects  (38.8%)  were  enrolled  in  the  study.  The  majority  of 
subjects  were  White  (95.6%)  and  of  “Not  Hispanic  or  Latino”  ethnicity  (98.5%).  More  than  half  of  the 
subjects had received an influenza vaccination in the previous 3 influenza seasons (57.9%). The majority

of subjects had a comorbidity risk score <50 (89.6%), suggesting a lower probability of hospitalization due 
to pneumonia or influenza or death. 
There were no notable differences in the distribution of demographic and baseline characteristics between 
the aQIV and QIV vaccine groups.

Medical History 
At least 1 medical disorder was reported as medical history for 88.4% of participants. The proportion of 
subjects  with  medical  disorders  was  similar  between  the  aQIV  (87.5%)  and  QIV  (89.3%)  groups. 
Hypertension was the most frequently reported medical history condition (reported in 40.1% of subjects 
overall); all other medical history conditions occurred at a frequency of less than 15%. 
Concomitant Use of Medications 
During the study (Day 1 through Day 271), use of at least 1 concomitant medication was reported by 92.5% 
of participants. The use of concomitant medications was similar between the aQIV group (92.0%) and the 
QIV group (92.9%). The most commonly reported types of concomitant medication were vaccines, mainly 
COVID-19 vaccines (aQIV: 60.0%; QIV: 58.6%) and agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system (aQIV: 
31.5%; QIV: 33.8%). 
The Overall Safety Set for the study V118_23 was 2043 participants aged 50-64 years of age. Of these, 
1027 participants received aQIV and 1016 participants received QIV.  
The demographic and baseline characteristics were generally comparable between vaccines. However, there 
were enrolled more female subjects (61.2%) than male subjects (38.8%) and more subjects in the range 
age  50-59years  (59.0%)  than  in  60-64  years  (41.0%).  It  is  known  that  age  and  sex  could  affect  the 
reactogenicity  profile in  vaccines.  Nevertheless,  the  same percentage  of  male/female and younger/older 
was  observed  in  both  groups,  therefore  the  possible  contribution  of  baseline  characteristics  to  the 
reactogenicity profile would be similar in both groups.  
In  addition,  the  majority  of  subjects  had  a  comorbidity  risk  score  <50  (89.6%),  suggesting  a  lower 
probability  of  hospitalization  due  to  pneumonia  or  influenza  or  death.  A  high  percentage  of  participants 
(88.4%)  reported  at  least  1  medical  disorder  as  medical  history.  Hypertension  was  the  most  frequently 
reported medical history condition (40.1%); all other medical history conditions occurred at a frequency of 
less than 15%. 
Furthermore,  92.5% of  participants received at least 1 concomitant medication during the study  (Day 1 
through  Day  271),  mainly  COVID  vaccines  (60%  approx.)  and  agents  acting  on  the  renin-angiotensin 
system (32% approx.). 
Adverse events 
Solicited adverse events 
The  Solicited  Safety  Set  included  2028  subjects  (99.3%  of  Overall  Safety  Set),  of  which  1020  subjects 
received aQIV and 1008 subjects received QIV.  
In the 7-day period after vaccination, the percentage of subjects reporting solicited AEs (any) was higher 
in the aQIV group than the QIV group (65.9% vs 53.7%). The percentage of subjects reporting solicited 
local  AEs  also  tended  to  be  higher  in  the  aQIV  group  than  the  QIV  group  (49.8%  vs  30.4%),  while  the 
percentages  of  subjects  reporting  solicited  systemic  AEs  were  similar  between  the  two  vaccine  groups

(45.3% vs 40.0%). The use of antipyretic/analgesics for treatment or prevention of pain/fever was similar 
between the aQIV and QIV groups (12.9% vs 9.6%). 
Solicited local Adverse Events 
The most commonly reported solicited local AE in both vaccine groups was injection site pain, with a higher 
percentage of subjects reporting pain in the aQIV group compared with the QIV group (47.1% vs 28.1%). 
The  percentages  of  subjects  reporting  induration  in  the  aQIV  and  QIV  groups  were  7.9%  and  3.5%, 
respectively and for erythema, 7.8% and 3.1%, respectively. The majority of solicited local AEs reported 
were mild or moderate in severity; severe solicited local AEs were reported by very few subjects (≤4 subjects 
per symptom) in either vaccine group.

Note 1: For induration, erythema, and ecchymosis, severe was defined as >100 mm; for pain, severe was 
defined as “Prevents daily activity”. 
In both aQIV and QIV groups, more subjects reported solicited local AEs during the Day 1-3 time interval 
(49.5%  and  29.9%,  respectively)  than  in  the  Day  4-7  time  interval  (9.3%  and  5.9%),  with  onset  most 
commonly  reported on Day  1 or Day 2. In  both vaccine groups,  the majority of  solicited  local  AEs were 
observed in ≤3 days. 
There  were  few  reports  of  solicited  local  AEs  continuing  or  starting  after  Day  7.  Injection  site  pain  and 
erythema  were  reported  after  Day  7  by  4  of  1020  subjects  (0.4%)  and  2  of  1020  subjects  (0.2%), 
respectively, in the aQIV group. In the QIV group, ecchymosis and injection site pain were reported by 2 
of 1008 subjects (0.2%) and 1 of 1008 subjects (0.1%), respectively. 
Solicited systemic Adverse Events 
The percentage of subjects reporting individual solicited systemic AEs was generally similar between the 
two vaccine groups. The most frequently reported solicited systemic AEs in both the aQIV and QIV groups 
were fatigue (29.5% and 24.3%, respectively) and headache (22.2% and 20.4%). Myalgia was reported 
by 13.0% in the aQIV and 7.2% of subjects in QIV groups, and arthralgia was reported by 13.7% and 9.4% 
of subjects, respectively.

The majority of solicited systemic AEs were mild or moderate in severity, with low proportions of subjects 
reporting  severe  solicited  systemic  AEs  (2.2%  in  both  vaccine  groups).  The  percentages  of  subjects 
reporting fever (≥38.0°C) were low in both the aQIV and QIV groups (2.5% and 1.7%), with severe fever 
(≥39.0°C) in only 8 subjects (0.8%) in the aQIV group and 4 subjects (0.4%) in the QIV group. Only 1 
subject, in the aQIV group, reported a body temperature of ≥40.0°C.

commonly  reported  on  Day  1  or  Day  2.  In  both  vaccine  groups,  most  of  solicited  systemic  AEs  were 
observed in ≤3 days. 
In total, 35 of 1020 subjects (3.4%) in the aQIV group and 40 of 1008 subjects (4.0%) in the QIV group 
reported solicited systemic AEs ongoing after Day 7. The most commonly events were fatigue, headache, 
and arthralgia, reported by 1.5%, 1.5%, and 1.2% of subjects, respectively, in the aQIV group, and  by 
2.1%, 1.3%, and 1.3% of subjects, respectively, in the QIV group. 
The number of participants evaluated for solicited AEs was 2028 subjects (1020 subjects in aQIV group and 
1008 subjects in QIV group).  
Any Solicited AEs were reported by 65.9% vs 53.7% of the evaluated participants, within the first 7 days 
aQIV or QIV treatment, respectively.  
The percentage of subjects reporting solicited local AEs tended to be higher in the aQIV group than the QIV 
group (49.8% vs 30.4%). The most frequently reported solicited local was injection site pain (47.1% vs 
28.1%), followed by induration (7.9% vs 3.5%) and erythema (7.8% vs 3.1%). The majority of solicited 
local AEs reported were mild or moderate in severity being reported on Day 1 or Day 2. In addition, most 
of solicited local AEs reported were observed in ≤3 days. 
Incidence of each severe solicited local AEs was very low, the highest frequency was 0.4% for erythema in 
aQIV (vs 0% in QIV) and 0.3% for pain in QIV (vs 0.1% in aQIV).   
The  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  solicited  systemic  AEs  were  similar  between  aQIV  group  and  QIV 
group (45.3% vs 40.0%). The most frequently solicited systemic AEs in both aQIV and QIV groups were 
fatigue (29.5% vs 24.3%, respectively) and headache (22.2% vs 20.4%), followed by myalgia (13.0% vs 
7.2%) and arthralgia (13.7% vs 9.4%). Fever (≥38.0°C) was reported with low frequency in both aQIV 
and  QIV  groups  respectively  (2.5%  and  1.7%).  The  majority  of  solicited  systemic  AEs  were  mild  or 
moderate in severity with onset most commonly reported on Day 1 or Day 2. In both vaccine groups, most 
of solicited systemic AEs were observed in ≤3 days. 
The frequency of severe solicited systemic AEs was 2.2% in both vaccine groups. Additionally, severe fever 
(≥39.0⁰C)  was  reported  by  only  8  subjects  (0.8%)  in  the  aQIV  group  and  4  subjects  (0.4%)  in  the  QIV 
group. Only 1 subject in the aQIV group reported a body temperature of ≥40.0°C. 
Unsolicited adverse events 
All 2043 subjects in the Overall Safety Set had unsolicited AE data and were included in the Unsolicited 
Safety Set.  
A summary of unsolicited AEs within 21 days following vaccination is presented in the table below. A 
similar percentage of participants with unsolicited AEs in aQIV and QIV was observed (16.5% vs 16.9%, 
respectively).   The majority of AEs were assessed as mild or moderate in severity in both vaccine 
groups; few subjects reported severe AEs (aQIV: 2 subjects [0.2%]; QIV: 7 subjects [0.7%]). The 
percentage of subjects with unsolicited AEs assessed by the Investigator as related to the study vaccine 
was low in both the aQIV (3.2%) and QIV (3.1%) groups.

Abbreviations: aQIV = adjuvanted Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine; QIV = quadrivalent influenza vaccine. 
Unsolicited AEs within 21 days after vaccination were reported with low and similar frequencies in aQIV 
and QIV. Specifically, the unsolicited AEs were reported by 16.5% in aQIV and 16.9% in QIV, being the 
related unsolicited AEs observed in 3.2% and 3.1% respectively. The majority of AEs were assessed as 
mild or moderate in severity in both vaccine groups. Few subjects reported severe AEs (0.2% vs 0.7%), 
but data of incidence of severe unsolicited AEs considered as related to the study vaccine are lacking. The 
MAH reported that there was only one severe event reported until 28 days after the QIV administration 
considered related and no case in aQIV group.  
The related unsolicited AEs by preferred term most commonly reported were injection site pain (0.3%) 
and lymphadenopathy (0.3%) in the aQIV group (vs 0.1% and 0.1% in QIV) and vertigo (0.3%) in the 
QIV group (vs 0.1% in aQIV). A slight imbalance in the event of lymphadenopathy considered as related 
to the study vaccine between the groups (3 events in aQIV vs 1 event in QIV) is observed. The MAH 
accepted the inclusion of Lymphadenopathy.

The rest of related unsolicited AEs were reported from 1 subject only in each vaccine group. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
There was 1 death reported during the study in the aQIV group, due to an AE of lung adenocarcinoma, 
assessed as not related to the study vaccine. 
Serious adverse events 
From Day 1 through Day 271, SAEs were reported by 31 participants (3.0%) in the aQIV group and 31 
participants (3.1%) in the QIV group. Most SAEs were reported by SOC of “Infections and infestations” (6 
subjects in aQIV group and 7 subjects in QIV group) followed by “Cardiac disorders” (5 subjects in each 
group) and “Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified” (5 subjects in each group)  
There were no related SAEs in the aQIV group.  
One SAE of hypertensive crisis (for which the subject was hospitalized) that started on the day of 
vaccination in a subject in the QIV group was assessed by the Investigator as related to the study 
vaccine. However, the Sponsor assessed this event as not related to the study vaccine, because the 
subject’s concurrent conditions of obesity, coronary sclerosis, hypercholesterolemia, and migraine 
provided alternative aetiology of the reported event.  
Adverse events of special interest 
From Day 1 through Day 271, 2 AESIs were reported by 2 subjects (0.2%) in the aQIV and no AESIs were 
reported in the QIV group. 
One subject reported worsening of rheumatoid arthritis and one subject reported autoimmune thyroiditis. 
Both AESIs were assessed as moderate in severity and were assessed by both the Investigator and Sponsor 
as not related to the study vaccine. It should be noted that the subject reporting worsening of rheumatoid 
arthritis had a history of rheumatoid arthritis (since 2002) and therefore should have been excluded from 
participation in the V118_23 study (Exclusion Criterion #4). 
During all study period (Day 271) no new safety concern was identified. Only one death assessed as not 
related  in  aQIV,  due  to  a  lung  adenocarcinoma  was  reported.  The  frequencies  of  SAE  were  low  in  both 
groups (3.0% in aQIV and 3.1% in QIV) and none was considered as related to the study vaccine by the 
investigator or promotor. In addition, there were only 2 subjects who reported AESIs in aQIV; one case of   
rheumatoid arthritis and one of autoimmune thyroiditis, both considered as not related by the investigator 
and the promotor.  
Laboratory findings 
No safety-related clinical laboratory data were collected in Study V118_23.

Safety by subgroups 
Safety in special populations 
Pregnancy and lactation 
Effects of aQIV in pregnancy and lactation have not been studied in Study V118_23 since pregnancy was 
an exclusion criterion and no pregnancies were reported during the study. 
Intrinsic factors 
Intrinsic factors for which safety was assessed include age cohort, gender, race, ethnicity, and comorbidity 
risk score (<50 and ≥50). 
By age 
The safety assessment by age cohort was performed in two age groups:  50 to ≤59 years and 60 to ≤64 
years.  
As observed for the overall study population, solicited local AEs were reported more frequently by subjects 
in  the  aQIV  group  than  the  QIV  group  for  both  subgroups  (50  to  59  years:  53.2%  vs  36.4%;  60  to  64 
years: 44.8% vs 21.8%, respectively) and no difference in the percentage of solicited systemic AEs (50 to 
59 years: 50.6% vs 43.5%; 60 to 64 years: 37.6% vs 35.0%) 
In  addition,  in  both  vaccine  groups,  solicited  local  and  systemic  AEs  were  reported  more  frequently  by 
subjects in the 50 to 59 years age subgroup than those in the 60 to 64 years age subgroup.  
Regarding unsolicited AEs, no notable differences in the frequency in the 50 to 59 years age subgroup as 
in the 60 to 64 years age subgroup (aQIV: 16.9% vs 15.8%; QIV: 18.3% vs 15.0%). 
By gender 
As observed for the overall study population, solicited local AEs were reported more frequently by subjects 
in  the  aQIV  group  than  the  QIV  group  for  both  subgroups  (male:  40.0%  vs  21.2%;  female:  55.9%  vs 
36.3%, respectively) and there was no difference in the percentage of solicited systemic AEs (male: 39.0% 
vs 31.7%; female: 49.2% vs 45.3%) or unsolicited AEs (male: 13.8% vs 16.6%; female: 18.1% vs 17.1%) 
In  addition,  in  both  vaccine  groups,  solicited  local  and  systemic  AEs  were  reported  more  frequently  by 
subjects in the female subgroup than the male subgroup. No difference of incidence of unsolicited AEs by 
sex was observed.  
By race 
The safety assessment by race cohort was performed in two race subgroups: Black or African American (69 
subjects) and White (1946 participants). The small number of Black or African American subjects in these 
analyses limits any conclusion for these observations- 
As observed for the overall study population, solicited local AEs were reported more frequently by subjects 
in the aQIV group than the QIV group in both subgroups (Black or African American: 52.8% vs 21.2%; 
White: 49.6% vs 30.7%) and no notable differences in the percentage of solicited systemic AEs (Black or 
African American subgroup: 61.1% vs 63.6%; White: 44.6% vs 39.4%) or unsolicited AEs (Black or African 
American subgroup: 5.1% vs 8.3%; White: 17.0% vs 17.3%). 
In the aQIV group, no notable differences in the percentage of solicited local AEs by race were observed. 
However, there were higher frequencies of solicited systemic AEs and lower frequencies of unsolicited AEs 
in Black or African American subjects than in White. In QIV group, there were higher solicited local AEs and 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/533902/2023 
Page 71/85 
 
 
 
 
unsolicited  AEs  and  lower  solicited  systemic  AEs  in  White  subjects  than  in  Black  or  African  American 
subjects.  
By ethnicity 
The safety assessment by ethnicity cohort was performed in two ethnicity subgroups: Hispanic or Latino 
(25  subjects)  and  Not  Hispanic  or  Latino  (2000  participants).  The  small  number  of  Hispanic  or  Latino 
subjects in these analyses limits any conclusion for these observations 
As observed for the overall study population, solicited local AEs were reported more frequently by subjects 
in the aQIV group than in the QIV group for the Hispanic or Latino ethnicity subgroup (57.1% vs 45.5%) 
and for  the “Not Hispanic or Latino”  ethnicity  subgroup (49.7%  vs  30.2%).  No notable difference in  the 
percentage of solicited systemic AEs was observed between the aQIV and QIV groups for the “Not Hispanic 
or Latino” ethnicity subgroup (45.0% vs 39.8%), whereas a higher percentage of solicited systemic AEs in 
the Hispanic or Latino ethnicity subgroup in the aQIV group compared with the QIV group (64.3% vs 45.5%) 
was  reported.  In  addition,  no  notable  differences  in  the  percentages  of  unsolicited  AEs  were  observed 
(Hispanic or Latino ethnicity: 21.4% vs 25.0%; Not Hispanic or Latino: 16.4% vs 16.9%).  
In  aQIV  groups,  solicited  local  and  systemic  AEs  and  unsolicited  AEs  were  reported  more  frequently  by 
subjects of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity compared with subjects of “Not Hispanic or Latino”. In QIV group, 
solicited  local  AEs  and  unsolicited  AEs  were  reported  more  frequently  by  subjects  of  Hispanic  or  Latino 
ethnicity  compared  with  subjects  of  “Not  Hispanic  or  Latino”  and  no  difference  was  observed  regarding 
solicited systemic AEs. 
By Comorbidity Risk Score 
As observed for the overall study population, solicited local AEs were reported more frequently by subjects 
in  the  aQIV  group  than  the  QIV  group  both  subgroup  (comorbidity  risk  score  <50:  49.7%  vs  30.3%; 
comorbidity risk score ≥50: 50.4% vs 31.3%) and there were no notable differences in the percentages of 
solicited systemic AEs (comorbidity risk score <50: 45.9% vs 39.4%; comorbidity risk score ≥50: 40.9% 
vs 45.8%) or unsolicited AEs (comorbidity risk score <50: 15.6% vs 17.1%; comorbidity risk score ≥50: 
23.5% vs 15.3%) 
For both vaccine groups, the percentages of subjects reporting solicited local and systemic AEs were similar 
between  subjects  with  a  comorbidity  risk  score  <50  and  subjects  with  a  comorbidity  risk  score  ≥50. 
Regarding unsolicited AEs in aQIV, higher incidence was observed in participants at risk, but this difference 
was not observed in QIV group. 
Extrinsic factors 
Extrinsic factor for which safety was assessed include previous influenza vaccination history. 
By Previous Vaccination History 
The safety assessment by Previous Vaccination History was performed in participants who had received an 
influenza vaccination in the previous 3 influenza seasons (subgroup YES) and in participants who had not 
received an influenza vaccination in the previous 3 influenza seasons (subgroup NO).  
As observed for the overall study population, solicited local AEs were reported more frequently by subjects 
in the aQIV group than the QIV group for both subgroups (YES: 54.0% vs 35.0%; NO 44.3% vs 23.8%; 
N=438 and 416) and no notable differences in the percentage of solicited systemic AEs (YES: 48.5% vs 
42.1%; NO: 41.1% vs  37.0%) or unsolicited AEs (YES: 16.2% vs 14.4%; NO: 16.8% vs 20.6%)  were 
observed between the aQIV and QIV groups for both subgroup 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/533902/2023 
Page 72/85 
 
 
 
 
For both vaccine groups, higher percentage of solicited local AEs was reported by subjects who had received 
an influenza vaccination in the previous 3 influenza seasons compared with subjects who had not and there 
was no difference in percentages of solicited systemic AEs or unsolicited AEs between subjects who had 
received an influenza vaccination in the previous 3 influenza seasons and subjects who had not. 
As  indicated,  effects  of  aQIV  in  pregnancy  and  lactation  have  not  been  studied  in  Study  V118_23  since 
pregnancy was an exclusion criteria and no pregnancies were reported during the study. 
In addition, safety assessment included age cohort (50-59 and 60-64 yoa), gender (male and female), race 
(White and Black or African American), ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino ethnicity and Not Hispanic or Latino), 
comorbidity  risk  score  (<50  and  ≥50)  and  previous  vaccination  history  (subjects  who  had  received  an 
influenza vaccination in the previous 3 influenza seasons compared with subjects who had not). However, 
in  the  assessment  by  race  and  ethnicity,  it  is  not  possible  to  make  a  conclusion  because  numbers  of 
participants  in  Black  or  African  American  subgroup  (69  subjects)  and  in  Hispanic  or  Latino  ethnicity  (25 
subjects) are small.  
The incidence of SAE and AESIs was low in the overall population. Nonetheless the safety analysis of SAEs 
or AESIs by subgroups has not been provided. The MAH reported no notable differences in the percentages 
of SAEs between the aQIV and QIV groups by age, gender, comorbidity risk score, and influenza vaccination 
history.  
 Regarding the reactogenicity profile, some difference was observed by subgroups analysis:  
- Solicited local and systemic AEs were reported in a higher frequency in participants aged 50-59 than in 
those 60-64 years. No difference in unsolicited AEs was observed.  
- Solicited local and systemic AEs were reported in a higher frequency in female than in male. No difference 
in unsolicited AEs was observed.  
-  Solicited  local  AEs  were  reported  with  a  higher  frequency  in  subjects  who  had  received  an  influenza 
vaccination in the 3 previous influenza seasons compared to subjects who had not. No difference in solicited 
systemic and unsolicited AEs was observed.  
- No difference in frequencies of solicited local and systemic AEs was observed by comorbidity risk score. 
However,  higher incidence of unsolicited AEs was  reported in  subjects with a comorbidity  risk  score  ≥50 
than in subjects with a comorbidity risk score <50.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Study V118_23 was not designed to prospectively investigate interactions with concomitant vaccinations 
of medications. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
One subject in the QIV group reported an AE leading to withdrawal from the study: severe aphasia, which 
was assessed as not related to the study vaccine. 
Post marketing experience 
The  first  approval  for  marketing  worldwide  was  received  in  Australia  on  24  Sep  2019.  aQIV  is  currently 
authorized in 38 countries for active immunization against influenza in persons 65 years of age and older.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/533902/2023 
Page 73/85 
 
 
 
 
Analysis of the post-marketing data received for aQIV cumulatively revealed no safety issues. The benefit-
risk profile of aQIV is favourable in the approved indication. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The aim of this variation was the registration of aQIV for use in persons 50 years of age and older based 
on the data generated in clinical study V118_23. 
The Overall Safety Set for the study V118_23 was 2043 participants aged 50-64 years of age. Of these, 
1027 participants received aQIV and 1016 participants received QIV.  
The demographic and baseline characteristics were generally comparable between vaccines. However, there 
were enrolled more female subjects (61.2%) than male subjects (38.8%) and more subjects in the range 
age  50-59years  (59.0%)  than  in  60-64  years  (41.0%).  It  is  known  that  age  and  sex  could  affect  the 
reactogenicity  profile in  vaccines.  Nevertheless,  the  same percentage of  male/female and younger/older 
was  observed  in  both  groups,  therefore  the  possible  contribution  of  baseline  characteristics  to  the 
reactogenicity profile would be similar in both groups.  
In  addition,  the  majority  of  subjects  had  a  comorbidity  risk  score  <50  (89.6%),  suggesting  a  lower 
probability  of  hospitalization  due  to  pneumonia  or  influenza  or  death.  A  high  percentage  of  participants 
(88.4%)  reported  at  least  1  medical  disorder  as  medical  history.  Hypertension  was  the  most  frequently 
reported medical history condition (40.1%); all other medical history conditions occurred at a frequency of 
less than 15%. 
Solicited AEs 
The number of participants evaluated for solicited AEs was 2028 subjects (1020 subjects in aQIV group and 
1008 subjects in QIV group).  
Any Solicited AEs were reported by 65.9% vs 53.7% of the evaluated participants, within the first 7 days 
aQIV or QIV treatment, respectively.  
The percentage of subjects reporting solicited local AEs tended to be higher in the aQIV group than the QIV 
group (49.8% vs 30.4%). The most frequently reported solicited local was injection site pain (47.1% vs 
28.1%), followed by induration (7.9% vs 3.5%) and erythema (7.8% vs 3.1%). The majority of solicited 
local AEs reported were mild or moderate in severity being reported on Day 1 or Day 2. In addition, most 
of solicited local AEs reported were observed in ≤3 days. 
Incidence of each severe solicited local AEs was very low, the highest frequency was 0.4% for erythema in 
aQIV (vs 0% in QIV) and 0.3% for pain in QIV (vs 0.1% in aQIV).   
The  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  solicited  systemic  AEs  were  similar  between  aQIV  group  and  QIV 
group (45.3% vs 40.0%). The most frequently solicited systemic AEs in both aQIV and QIV groups were 
fatigue (29.5% vs 24.3%, respectively) and headache (22.2% vs 20.4%), followed by myalgia (13.0% vs 
7.2%) and arthralgia (13.7% vs 9.4%). Fever (≥38.0°C) was reported with low frequency in both aQIV 
and  QIV  groups  respectively  (2.5%  and  1.7%).  The  majority  of  solicited  systemic  AEs  were  mild  or 
moderate in severity with onset most commonly reported on Day 1 or Day 2. In both vaccine groups, most 
of solicited systemic AEs were observed in ≤3 days. 
The frequency of severe solicited systemic AEs was 2.2% in both vaccine groups. Additionally, severe fever 
(≥39.0⁰C)  was  reported  by  only  8  subjects  (0.8%)  in  the  aQIV  group  and  4  subjects  (0.4%)  in  the  QIV 
group. Only 1 subject in the aQIV group reported a body temperature of ≥40.0°C.

Unsolicited AEs 
Unsolicited AEs within 21 days after vaccination were reported with low and similar frequencies in aQIV and 
QIV. Specifically, the unsolicited AEs were reported by 16.5% in aQIV and 16.9% in QIV, being the related 
unsolicited AEs observed  in  3.2% and 3.1%  respectively. The  majority of  AEs  were assessed as mild or 
moderate in severity in both vaccine groups. Few subjects reported severe AEs (0.2% vs 0.7%), but data 
of incidence of severe unsolicited AEs considered as related to the study vaccine are lacking. The MAH was 
requested to provide this information. The MAH has reported that only one severe event until 28 days after 
the QIV administration was considered related and no case in the aQIV group. 
The related unsolicited AEs by preferred term most commonly reported were injection site pain (0.3%) and 
lymphadenopathy (0.3%) in the aQIV  group (vs 0.1% and 0.1% in QIV) and vertigo (0.3%) in the QIV 
group (vs 0.1% in aQIV). A slight imbalance in the event of lymphadenopathy considered as related to the 
study  vaccine  between  the  groups  (3  events  in  aQIV  vs  1  events  in  QIV)  is  observed.  The  inclusion  of 
Lymphadenopathy under the uncommon frequency category was agreed. 
The rest of related unsolicited AEs were reported from 1 subject only in each vaccine group. 
Deaths, SAEs and AESIs 
During all study period (Day 271) no new safety concern was identified. Only one death assessed as not 
related  in  aQIV,  due  to  a  lung  adenocarcinoma  was  reported.  The  frequencies  of  SAE  were  low  in  both 
groups (3.0% in aQIV and 3.1% in QIV) and none was considered as related to the study vaccine by the 
investigator or promotor. In addition, there were only 2 subjects who reported AESIs in aQIV; one case of   
rheumatoid arthritis and one of autoimmune thyroiditis, both considered as not related by the investigator 
and the promotor.  
Safety by subgroups 
Effects of aQIV in pregnancy and lactation have not been studied in Study V118_23 since pregnancy was 
an exclusion criteria and no pregnancies were reported during the study. 
In addition, safety assessment included age cohort (50-59 and 60-64 yoa), gender (male and female), race 
(White and Black or African American), ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino ethnicity and Not Hispanic or Latino), 
comorbidity  risk  score  (<50  and  ≥50)  and  previous  vaccination  history  (subjects  who  had  received  an 
influenza vaccination in the previous 3 influenza seasons compared with subjects who had not). However, 
in  the  assessment  by  race  and  ethnicity,  it  is  not  possible  to  make  a  conclusion  because  numbers  of 
participants  in  Black  or  African  American  subgroup  (69  subjects)  and  in  Hispanic  or  Latino  ethnicity  (25 
subjects) are small.  
The incidence of SAE and AESIs was low in the overall population. Nonetheless the safety analysis of SAEs 
or  AESIs  by  subgroups  has  not  been  provided.  The  MAH  was  requested  to  provide  these  data  by  age, 
gender,  comorbidity  risk  score  and  previous  vaccination  history.  The  MAH  has  reported  that  no  notable 
differences were found in the percentages of subjects reporting SAEs between the aQIV and QIV groups by 
age, gender, comorbidity risk score, and influenza vaccination history.  
 Regarding the reactogenicity profile, some difference was observed by subgroups analysis:  
- Solicited local and systemic AEs were reported in a higher frequency in participants aged 50-59 than in 
those 60-64 years. No difference in unsolicited AEs was observed.  
- Solicited local and systemic AEs were reported in a higher frequency in female than in male. No difference 
in unsolicited AEs was observed.

-  Solicited  local  AEs  were  reported  with  a  higher  frequency  in  subjects  who  had  received  an  influenza 
vaccination in the 3 previous influenza seasons compared to subjects who had not. No difference in solicited 
systemic and unsolicited AEs was observed.  
- No difference in frequencies of solicited local and systemic AEs was observed by comorbidity risk score. 
However,  higher incidence of unsolicited AEs was  reported in  subjects with a comorbidity  risk  score  ≥50 
than in subjects with a comorbidity risk score <50.  
Post marketing experience 
The  first  approval  for  marketing  worldwide  was  received  in  Australia  on  24  Sep  2019.  aQIV  is  currently 
authorized in 38 countries for active immunization against influenza in persons 65 years of age and older.  
Analysis of the post-marketing data received for aQIV cumulatively revealed no safety issues. The benefit-
risk profile of aQIV is favourable in the approved indication. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The aQIV  vaccine is  well tolerated in subject aged  50-64 years.  The incidence of  solicited  local  AEs was 
higher in aQIV compared to QIV and no difference was observed regarding solicited systemic and unsolicited 
AEs between two groups. The higher incidence of solicited local AES was mainly driven by differences in 
site  injection  pain  (47.1%  vs  28.1%.)  and  this  not  considered  a  relevant  safety  issue.  The  majority  of 
adverse events was mild or moderate in severity and resolved in few days. The incidence of SAEs and AESIs 
was  low  in  both  groups  and  none  was  considered  related  to  the  study  vaccine  by  the  promotor  or 
investigator. No new safety concern was identified.  
In addition, in aQIV group, higher reactogenicity was observed in participants aged 50-59 than in those 60-
64 years and in female than male subjects.  
In  conclusion,  the  safety  profile  of  aQIV  is  considered  to  be  adequate  to  support  the  indication  for 
prophylaxis of influenza in subjects ≥50 years of age.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
Adjuvanted  Quadrivalent  Influenza  Vaccine  (aQIV;  Fluad  Tetra/Quad/Quadrivalent)  is  an  egg-derived 
inactivated  subunit  quadrivalent  influenza  virus  vaccine  adjuvanted  with  MF59C.1  (MF59),  a  squalene-
based  oil-in-water  emulsion.  Fluad  Tetra/Quad/Quadrivalent  is  licensed  in  38  countries  (Australia,  the 
United States [US], the European Union [EU] plus Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein, New Zealand, United 
Kingdom, Argentina, Brazil, Republic of Korea, and Taiwan) for use in adults aged 65 years and over.  
To support registration of aQIV for use in persons 50 years of age and older, the MAH provides the results 
on the benefits and risks of aQIV for prevention of influenza in persons 50 to 64 years of age based on the 
data generated in clinical study V118_23. 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Influenza is a highly contagious infectious disease that occurs in epidemics throughout the winter months 
in temperate climates in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The influenza virus is an orthomyxovirus 
with two clinically relevant types (types A and B).  
Type  A  viruses  are  associated  with  both  annual  epidemics  and  pandemics,  and  B  viruses  contribute  to 
annual epidemics. The type A viruses are further divided into different subtypes, of which the A/H3N2 and 
A/H1N1 viruses are the most clinically relevant for the annual influenza disease burden. For influenza B, 
only a single type is known to exist, but 2 distinct genetic lineages are identified: Yamagata and Victoria. 
Influenza  is  characterized  by  the  abrupt  onset  of  respiratory  and  systemic  symptoms,  such  as  fever, 
myalgia, headache, severe malaise, non-productive cough, sore throat, and rhinitis and generally resolves 
within  2  to  7  days.  However,  influenza  can  exacerbate  underlying  medical  conditions  and/or  lead  to 
secondary  viral  or  bacterial  pneumonia  for  some  people,  notably  older  adults  and  those  with  chronic 
diseases (including pulmonary or circulatory disorders, metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus, renal 
dysfunction, or immunosuppression). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Vaccination is considered the best strategy to lower the burden of influenza disease. However, the efficacy 
of influenza vaccines in older individuals is significantly lower than in younger individuals due to the aging 
of the immune system as well as underlying medical conditions, factors which increase the risk of influenza 
complications and interfere with immune responses.  
For  adults  over  the  age  of  50  years,  the  ability  to  respond  well  to  vaccination  is  affected  by 
immunosenescence, in which advancing age diminishes the effectiveness of the immune system. Immune 
responses against conventional trivalent influenza vaccines in adults ≥58 years of age have been shown to 
be 10% to 23% lower than in adults younger than 58 years of age. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/533902/2023 
Page 78/85 
 
 
 
 
While it is well established that adults 65 years and older are at greater risk of serious complications from 
influenza compared with young, healthy adults, there is growing recognition of a high burden of disease in 
adults aged 50 to 64 years of age.  
In the EU, approximately 93 million people are between the age of 50 to 64 years. The impact of seasonal 
influenza on hospitalizations and mortality was evaluated for 10 influenza seasons between 1996 and 2006 
in five European countries (Netherlands, United Kingdom, France, Portugal, and Spain). For hospitalizations, 
the percentage of admissions due to respiratory disease caused by influenza activity for the 50 to 64 years 
age  group  ranged  between  2.7%  and  4.8%  and  the  percentage  of  admissions  due  to  pneumonia  and 
influenza ranged between 3.3% and 12.3%. For deaths, the percentage of all-cause mortality caused by 
influenza activity in the 50 to 64 years age group was between 1.7% and 3.4%, lower than the 3.2% and 
7.4% range observed in the age group 65 years and older. The percentage of mortality due to respiratory 
disease caused by influenza activity was similar for the age groups 50 to 64 years and 65 years and older, 
9.4%-19.4%  and  9.4%-19.3%,  respectively  as  was  the  percentage  of  mortality  due  to  pneumonia  and 
influenza caused by influenza activity 11.8%-24.5% and 12.1%-25.1%, respectively.  These data indicate 
influenza disease contributes to a substantial health burden in the 50 to 64-year-old population.  
In the US, the estimated rate of hospitalizations due to influenza disease is 3-fold higher in adults 50 to 64 
years  of  age  compared  to  the  younger  adult  (18-49  years)  age  group  (155.1  vs  48.4  per  100,000 
population). Furthermore, the estimated number of medical visits due to influenza illnesses is higher in the 
50 to 64 years age group (3.97 million) compared with older adults (1.72 million). 
In  recognition  of  the  high  burden  of  influenza  disease  in  adults  50  to  64  years  of  age,  the  US  Advisory 
Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has defined the risk group for older adults as persons aged 
50 years and older. In the EU, seasonal influenza vaccine is also recommended for older adults with age of 
recommendation ranging from ≥50 to ≥65 years (European Vaccination Information Portal, 2022).  
Given increased susceptibility to infectious diseases with aging, novel vaccine formulations are needed to 
elicit effective immunity in older individuals. One way to increase the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines 
is by using adjuvants. The mechanism of action of the adjuvant MF59 has been extensively detailed in the 
initial  dossier.  The  immune-enhancing  benefit  of  the  adjuvant  MF59  in  aQIV  has  been  demonstrated  in 
persons 65 years of age and older and its effect is described for persons 50 years and older in the current 
application. 
It  is  noted  that  for  the  age  group  50  to  64  YOA,  there  are  other  two  influenza  quadrivalent  vaccines 
approved  by  the  centralized  procedure  in  the  EU  (Flucelvax  Tetra  –  Sequirus  Netherlands,  B.V-  and 
Supemtek  –Sanofi Paster-).  Flucelvax  Tetra contains  antigens  derived  from  influenza virus  grown  in  cell 
culture,  and  is  indicated  for  subjects  from  2  yoa.  Supemtek  is  a  vaccine  containing  recombinant  HA 
produced  in  insect  cells,  and  is  indicated  for  subjects  18  yoa.  Moreover,  there  are  also  a  number  of 
quadrivalent  vaccines  approved  in  different  EU  countries  by  RMP/DCP  procedures  (e.g.,  Mylan  IRE 
Healthcare Limited, Glaxo Smith Kline, S.A., and Sanofi Pasteur Europe, MSD). These vaccines contain viral 
antigens derived from influenza virus grown in eggs, and have an indication for subjects >= 6 months of 
age. Thus, there are a number of quadrivalent influenza vaccines available in the EU for subjects 50 to 64 
y and thus there is not an unmet medical need for this population. Nonetheless, if this variation procedure 
were approved, aQIV would represent, for subjects 50-64 yoa, an adjuvanted alternative to current licensed 
non-adjuvanted vaccines. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study  V118_23 was a randomized,  comparator-controlled,  observer-blind,  multicenter  study  to evaluate 
the immunogenicity and safety of aQIV versus a licensed non-adjuvanted QIV comparator (QIV) in subjects 
50 to 64 years of age. The non-inferiority and superiority of the immune response of aQIV compared with 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/533902/2023 
Page 79/85 
 
 
 
 
QIV  were  evaluated  in  a  sequential  manner.  Immunogenicity,  antibody  persistence,  reactogenicity,  and 
safety of the two vaccines were also assessed in this study population. 
A total of 2018 subjects were planned to be enrolled in the study. Subjects 50 to 64 years of age were 
randomized  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  receive  aQIV  or  the  QIV  comparator  vaccine  (Fluarix  Tetra/Quadrivalent). 
Randomization  was  stratified  by  age  (50  to  ≤59  years;  60  to  ≤64  years)  and  history  of  any  influenza 
vaccination within  the previous  3 influenza seasons (yes/no). Subjects received a single 0.5 mL dose of 
vaccine (aQIV or QIV) on Day 1, administered intramuscularly. 
The aim of this study was to demonstrate both a noninferior immune response as assessed by geometric 
mean titre (GMT) ratio and seroconversion rate (SCR) difference for each strain and a superior immune 
response  as  assessed  by  GMT  ratio  for  at  least  2  of  the  4  strains  of  aQIV  compared  with  a  licensed 
nonadjuvanted inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV), 3 weeks after vaccination, in adults 50-64 
years of age. In addition, immunogenicity, antibody persistence, reactogenicity, and safety were assessed. 
Data  from  this  study  supported  the  licensure  of  the  quadrivalent  version  of  Fluad  for  the  prevention  of 
seasonal influenza in adults 50-64 years of age. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint aimed at demonstrating non-inferiority of aQIV compared with a nonadjuvanted QIV 
was successfully demonstrated in this study population of subjects 50 to 64 years of age. The prespecified 
success criteria (upper limit [UL] of the 95% confidence interval [CI] for the Day 22 GMT ratio ≤1.5) were 
met with respect to the GMT ratio (A/H1N1: 0.87; A/H3N2: 0.99; B/Yamagata: 1.01; B/Victoria: 1.07) and 
SCR difference (UL of the 95% CI for the difference in SCR is ≤10%) (A/H1N1: -0.89%; A/H3N2: 2.52%; 
B/Yamagata: 2.22%; B/Victoria: 0.87%; complete serology dataset analysis: A/H1N1: -0.74%; A/H3N2: 
2.48%; B/Yamagata: 2.00%; B/Victoria: 0.45%) for all 4 vaccine strains  
In relation to the other primary endpoint, the first analysis of the HI data showed superior immune response 
of aQIV versus QIV for only 1 of the 4 vaccine strains (A/H1N1 [UL of the 95% CI for Day 22 GMTr: 0.87) 
and thus the prespecified success criteria for meeting this primary endpoint was not met since it required 
showing  superiority  for  at  least  two  viral  strains.  An  additional  post-hoc  analysis,  based  on  a  “complete 
serology  set”  which  incorporated  additional  serum  samples,  showed  superior  immune  response  of  aQIV 
versus QIV for 2 of the 4 vaccine strains (A/H1N1 [UL of the 95% CI for Day 22 GMTr: 0.88] and A/H3N2 
[UL of the 95% CI for Day 22 GMTr: 0.998]). 
Persistence  of  the  antibody  responses  to  each  of  the  4  vaccine  strains  was  observed  6  months  after 
vaccination (Day 181) in both vaccine groups, with evidence for a higher immune response to the A/H1N1 
strain (UL of the 95% CI for Day 181 GMTr: 0.94) in the aQIV group compared with the QIV group. 
Subgroup analyses identified a higher Day 22 immune response for aQIV versus QIV for multiple vaccine 
strains in clinically meaningful subgroups. For individuals with a higher probability of hospitalization due to 
pneumonia, influenza or death as defined by a comorbidity risk score ≥50, higher antibody responses were 
observed  for  A/H1N1,  A/H3N2  and  B/Yamagata  strains.  In  addition,  for  persons  without  a  history  of 
influenza vaccination within the previous 3 years, higher responses were observed for A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 
strains.  
New data were presented by the MAH during the assessment procedure. The RCTs compare the immune 
response  of  an  MF-59  adjuvanted  trivalent  influenza  vaccine  vs  a  non-adjuvanted  one,  and  the  results 
indicate  overall  a  higher  immune  response  of  the  MF-59  adjuvanted  vaccines  compared  to  the  non-
adjuvanted ones in the age group 50 to 64 yoa. Moreover, evidence from retrospective cohort studies and 
public health surveillance also indicate adequate vaccine effectiveness of the MF-59 adjuvanted vaccine in 
the 50-64 and in the 65-74 years age group. This latter age group is the closest one to the sought age 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 80/85 
 
 
 
 
indication of 50 to 64 years. Collectively, and despite the limitations of some of these data, it is concluded 
that all evidence provided is sufficient to support approval, from the efficacy point of view, of the current 
variation procedure that seeks extending the indication to the 50-64 years age group. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Demonstration of non-inferiority of aQIV vs QIV was clearly demonstrated in terms of SCR differences and 
GMT titres for all four viral strains. In general, the SCR rates achieved for aQIV were slightly higher for the 
four  viral  strains  (1.8  to  4.5%)  than  those  achieved  when  using  QIV.  Similarly,  estimates  of  GMT  titres 
were always higher for those receiving aQIV than those that received QIV. However, this apparent increase 
in the immune response provided by the adjuvanted vaccines did only translate, in the first immunogenicity 
analysis, in showing superiority against one viral strain (H1N1), and it is noted that the results for A/H3N2 
strain marginally exceeded the predefined criterion.  
A post-hoc analysis, which incorporated additional serum samples, showed superior immune response of 
aQIV versus QIV for 2 of the 4 vaccine strains (A/H1N1 and A/H3N2), and thus met the specified success 
criteria  for  this  primary  endpoint.  From  a  methodological  and  statistical  point  of  view,  this  post-hoc 
sensitivity analysis can never replace or rescue the main analysis, as there is no free alpha for confirmatory 
testing.  In  this  sense,  the  study  failed  to  meet  that  planned  primary  objective,  and  therefore  the 
immunological benefit of aQIV compared to QIV cannot be considered as positive in persons 50 to 64 years 
of age. 
Moreover, even in the case that the results of the “complete serology dataset” were considered relevant, 
the demonstration of  superior  immunogenicity  for  only  2 strains,  questions the protection  benefit  of  the 
vaccine against all four components of the quadrivalent vaccines.  
It is unclear how to translate in terms of clinical protection conferred by the vaccine, the higher persistence 
of antibody response observed 6 months after vaccination to only one strain (A/H1N1) strain. 
It is noted that results from trial V118_23 covered only one influenza season, and therefore it is unknown 
whether these can be extrapolated to other seasons, since the composition of vaccine is updated annually. 
The results from the subgroup analyses that showed higher antibody responses for subjects at higher risk 
of  influenza  complications  due  to  baseline  comorbidities  and  for  subjects  without  a  history  of  influenza 
vaccination within the previous 3 years, need to be taken with caution since for both cases the differences 
found were not statistically significant.  
The CHMP guideline on influenza vaccines (EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014) does not specify if superiority 
needs to be demonstrated for all four influenza strains, but the MAH criterion for success is that superiority 
needs to be demonstrated in terms of GMTR for at least 2 of the 4 vaccine strains. In order to justify this 
success criterion, the MAH indicates that the “responses to influenza vaccine strains show high variability 
across seasons and by strain.... Accordingly, a success criterion of at least 2 of the 4 viral strains being 
superior  to  the  comparator  vaccine  represents  a  clinically  meaningful  benefit”.  It  is  considered  that 
optimally, superiority of aQIv vs QIV in terms of GMT ratio should have been demonstrated for the four 
viral strains to robustly demonstrate the role of the adjuvant in terms of inducing an increase of the immune 
response in comparison with a non-adjuvanted vaccine.   
The new data regarding RCTs (comparing adjuvanted and non-adjunvanted trivalent  vaccines) show overall 
an immune benefit of the adjuvanted vaccine over the non-adjuvanted one, although this benefit does not 
translate in statistically superiority (in terms of GMTR) to all vaccine components in every season. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

A major weakness of the two retrospective cohort studies that showed higher vaccine effectiveness of the 
adjuvanted vs non adjuvanted vaccines is that none of them used influenza-confirmed cases as primary 
effectiveness outcome, which is the preferred endpoint for influenza VE studies. 
The public health surveillance study carried out by the United Kingdom Health Security Agency (UKHSA) 
does not provide relative vaccine effectiveness of an adjuvanted vs a non-adjuvanted vaccine, although the 
results  obtained  show  significant  vaccine  effectiveness  of  aQIV  against  laboratory-confirmed  influenza 
hospitalisation in the 50-64 and in the 65-74 years of age group. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of aQIV in subjects 50-64 years of age was evaluated in the clinical trial V118_23. The 
overall safety Set included 2043 participants aged 50-64 years (1027 participants received aQIV and 1016 
participants received QIV). Solicited AEs were evaluated in the majority of participants (99.3%).  
The percentage of subjects reporting solicited local AEs tended to be higher in the aQIV group than in the 
QIV  group  (49.8%  vs  30.4%),  which  is  mainly  explained  by  the  difference  regarding  injection  site  pain 
(47.1%  vs  28.1%).  However,  the  percentages  of  subjects  reporting  solicited  systemic  AEs  were  similar 
between aQIV group and QIV group (45.3% vs 40.0%). 
Most frequently reported solicited AEs were injection site pain (47.1% vs 28.1%), fatigue (29.5% vs 24.3%, 
respectively) and headache (22.2% vs 20.4%) followed by myalgia (13.0% vs 7.2%) and arthralgia (13.7% 
vs 9.4%). The majority of solicited AEs (local and systemic) were mild or moderate in severity with onset 
most commonly reported on Day 1 or Day 2, and were resolved in ≤3 days. 
Fever (≥38ºC) was reported with low frequency in both groups but slightly higher in aQIV than in QIV (2.5% 
and 1.7%). Of note, 1 subject, who received aQIV, reported a body temperature of ≥40.0ºC. 
Unsolicited AEs within 21 days after vaccination were reported with low and similar frequencies in aQIV and 
QIV. Specifically, the unsolicited AEs considered related were reported by 3.2% and 3.1% respectively. A 
slight imbalance is observed in the event of lymphadenopathy considered as related to the study vaccine 
between the groups (3 events in aQIV vs 1 event in QIV). The MAH updated the section 4.8 of the SmPC , 
including    Lymphadenopathy  (with  frequency  uncommon),  instead  of  listing  it  in  the  section  of  adverse 
reactions reported from post-marketing surveillance. 
Deaths, SAEs and AESIs were reported with very low frequencies in both groups and none of the events 
were considered as related to the study vaccine.    
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The  rates  of  solicited  AEs  reported  through  Day  7  after  any  vaccination  were  comparable  between  both 
vaccine groups (aQIV and QIV) in subjects aged 50-64 years, with the exception of higher local reactions 
in aQIV than in QIV. The higher incidence of solicited local AES was mainly driven by differences in site 
injection pain (47.1% vs 28.1%.) and this not considered a relevant safety issue. 
Stratifying by age, in participants who received aQIV, higher reactogenicity was observed in subjects aged 
50-59 than in those of 60-64 years. However, no comparative analysis between subjects 50-64 years and 
≥65 years was performed.  
In addition, the overall safety set included 2043 participants aged 50-64 years (1027 participants received 
aQIV and 1016 participants received QIV). This sample size is sufficient to define the reactogenicity profile; 
nevertheless, it does not allow to detect adverse reactions of uncommon or rare frequencies.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Non-inferiority of aQIV vs QIV in terms of SCR differences and GMT titres was demonstrated for the four 
influenza  viral  strains  (primary  endpoint  1a).  However,  the  primary  endpoint  1b  that  required 
demonstrating superior response of aQIV in terms of GMT for at least 2 of the influenza viral strains was 
not met. The additional post-hoc analysis regarding endpoint 1b, that showed superior immune response 
of aQIV versus QIV for 2 of the 4 vaccine strains (A/H1N1 and A/H3N2), is not considered valid to rescue 
the first failed analysis from a methodological and statistical point of view.  
The new data from three RCTs comparing the immune response of an MF-59 adjuvanted trivalent influenza 
vaccine  vs  a  nonadjuvanted  one,  indicate  overall  a  higher  immune  response  of  the  MF-59  adjuvanted 
vaccines compared to the non-adjuvanted ones in the age group 50 to 64 yoa. Moreover, evidence from 
retrospective cohort studies and public health surveillance also indicate adequate vaccine effectiveness of 
the MF-59 adjuvanted vaccine in the 50-64 and in the 65-74 years age group. This latter age group is the 
closest one to the sought age indication of 50 to 64 years. 
In conclusion, taking into account the variability of the immune response to influenza vaccines, and in the 
absence of a clear-cut criterion to demonstrate superiority of an adjuvanted vs a non-adjuvanted vaccine 
(according to the current CHMP guideline on influenza vaccines), it is considered that collectively the efficacy 
evidence provided is sufficient to support approval of the current variation procedure that seeks extending 
the indication to the 50-64 years age group. 
Regarding safety, the aQIV vaccine is well tolerated in subject aged 50-64 years. The only clear difference 
in the safety profile of aQIV and QIV relates to the higher frequency of site injection pain (47.1 in aQIV %

vs 28.1% in QIV) and this is not considered a relevant safety issue. Thus, from the safety point of view, 
the extension of the indication to subjects 50 to 64 YOA is supported. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Collectively,  and despite the limitations commented  above,  it  is concluded  that altogether,  the  evidence 
provided is sufficient to support approval, from the efficacy point of view, of the current variation procedure 
that seeks extending the indication to the 50-64 years age group. 
The safety data of aQIV do not rise any concern, and therefore the extension of the indication to subjects 
50 to 64 YOA is supported.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of aQIV for prevention of influenza in persons 50 to 64 is positive. 
The MAH commits to submit the results of the ongoing study V118_24 to EMA when available.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based  on  the  review  of  the  submitted  data,  the  CHMP  considers  the  following  variation  acceptable  and 
therefore recommends by consensus the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning 
the following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I, IIIA and 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
IIIB 
approved one  
Extension of indication to include adults 50 years of age and older for Fluad Tetra, based on final results 
from study V118_23; this is a phase 3, randomized, observer-blind, controlled, multicenter, clinical study 
to evaluate immunogenicity and safety of an MF59-adjuvanted quadrivalent subunit inactivated influenza 
vaccine in comparison with a licensed quadrivalent influenza vaccine, in adults 50 to 64 years of age. As a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Labelling and Package Leaflet are 
updated  in  accordance.  Version  3.0  of  the  RMP  has  also  been  approved.  In  addition,  the  marketing 
authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to the PI. 
The  variation  leads  to  amendments  to  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  Labelling  and  Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I, IIIA and IIIB and to the 
Risk Management Plan are recommended.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for alemtuzumab, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Listeriosis/Listeria meningitis 
Medicines that have a modulating effect on the immune system as Lemtrada might be associated with 
an increased risk of opportunistic infections. A total of 5 case reports all originating from the EU were 
identified. One alemtuzumab -treated MS clinical trial patient, enrolled in study CAMMS223, developed 
listeria meningitis and four spontaneous post-marketing cases of either systemic listeriosis or Listeria 
monocytogenes meningitis.  
Bradycardia as an infusion related adverse reaction 
Seventy-one cases (in 55 patients) of bradycardia (two of which were assessed as serious, the 
remainder as non-serious) were reported in clinical trials. A total of 1,505 alemtuzumab patients were 
exposed in these trials. In addition, thirty-nine cases of bradycardia (eight of which were assessed as 
serious, the remainder as non-serious) were reported from alemtuzumab post-marketing reports as of 
01 May 2015. Each of the ten serious cases involving bradycardia occurred in the context of infusion- 
associated reactions.  
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considered that changes to 
the product information of medicinal products containing alemtuzumab were warranted. The section 
4.4 of the summary of product characteristics and the relevant sections of the package leaflet were 
updated. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for alemtuzumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing alemtuzumab is unchanged subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied.

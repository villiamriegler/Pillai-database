CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Kisplyx is indicated for the treatment of adults with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC): 
• 
in combination with pembrolizumab, as first-line treatment (see section 5.1). 
• 
in combination with everolimus, following one prior vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF)-targeted therapy (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated and supervised by a healthcare professional experienced in the use of 
anticancer therapies. 
Posology 
Kisplyx in combination with pembrolizumab as first-line treatment 
The recommended dose of lenvatinib is 20 mg (two 10-mg capsules) orally once daily in combination 
with pembrolizumab either 200 mg every 3 weeks or 400 mg every 6 weeks administered as an 
intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. The daily dose of lenvatinib is to be modified as needed 
according to the dose/toxicity management plan. Lenvatinib treatment should continue until disease 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
progression or unacceptable toxicity. Pembrolizumab should be continued until disease progression, 
unacceptable toxicity or the maximum duration of therapy as specified for pembrolizumab.  
See the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for pembrolizumab for full pembrolizumab 
dosing information. 
Kisplyx in combination with everolimus as second-line treatment 
The recommended daily dose of lenvatinib is 18 mg (one 10-mg capsule and two 4-mg capsules) 
orally once daily in combination with 5 mg of everolimus once daily. The daily dose of lenvatinib and, 
if necessary, everolimus is to be modified as needed according to the dose/toxicity management plan. 
See the SmPC for everolimus for full everolimus dosing information.  
If a patient misses a dose of lenvatinib, and it cannot be taken within 12 hours, then that dose should 
be skipped and the next dose should be taken at the usual time of administration. 
Treatment should continue as long as there is clinical benefit or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
Dose adjustment and discontinuation for lenvatinib 
Management of adverse reactions may require dose interruption, adjustment, or discontinuation of 
lenvatinib therapy (see section 4.4). Mild to moderate adverse reactions (e.g., Grade 1 or 2) generally 
do not warrant interruption of lenvatinib unless intolerable to the patient despite optimal management. 
Severe (e.g., Grade 3) or intolerable adverse reactions require interruption of lenvatinib until 
improvement of the reaction to Grade 0 to 1 or baseline. 
Optimal medical management (i.e., treatment or therapy) for nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea should 
be initiated prior to any lenvatinib therapy interruption or dose reduction; gastrointestinal toxicity 
should be actively treated in order to reduce the risk of development of renal impairment or renal 
failure (see section 4.4). 
For toxicities thought to be related to lenvatinib (see Table 2), upon resolution/improvement of an 
adverse reaction to Grade 0 to 1 or baseline, treatment should be resumed at a reduced dose of 
lenvatinib as suggested in Table 1.

When used in combination with pembrolizumab, one or both medicines should be interrupted as 
appropriate. Lenvatinib should be withheld, dose reduced, or discontinued as appropriate. Withhold or 
discontinue pembrolizumab in accordance with the instructions in the SmPC for pembrolizumab. No 
dose reductions are recommended for pembrolizumab.

For toxicities thought to be related to everolimus, treatment should be interrupted, reduced to alternate 
day dosing, or discontinued (see the SmPC for everolimus for dose adjustment recommendations 
regarding specific adverse reactions).  
For toxicities thought to be related to both lenvatinib and everolimus, lenvatinib should be reduced 
(see Table 1) prior to reducing everolimus. 
All treatments should be discontinued in case of life-threatening reactions (e.g., Grade 4) with the 
exception of laboratory abnormalities judged to be non-life-threatening, in which case they should be 
managed as severe reactions (e.g., Grade 3).  
Grades are based on the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE).

Special populations 
For information about clinical experience with the combination treatment of lenvatinib and 
pembrolizumab, see section 4.8. 
Patients of age ≥65 years, with baseline hypertension or those with renal impairment appear to have 
reduced tolerability to lenvatinib (see section 4.8). 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No data for the combination of lenvatinib and everolimus are available for most of the special 
populations. The following information is derived from clinical experience of single agent lenvatinib 
in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC; see SmPC for Lenvima). 
All patients other than those with severe hepatic or renal impairment (see below) should initiate 
treatment at the recommended dose of 20 mg of lenvatinib daily with pembrolizumab or 18 mg of 
lenvatinib with 5 mg of everolimus taken once daily as indicated, following which the dose should be 
further adjusted on the basis of individual tolerability. 
Patients with hypertension 
Blood pressure should be well controlled prior to treatment with lenvatinib, and should be regularly 
monitored during treatment (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).  
Patients with hepatic impairment 
Limited data are available for the combination of lenvatinib with pembrolizumab in patients with 
hepatic impairment. No adjustment of starting dose of the combination is required on the basis of 
hepatic function in patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment. 
In patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, the recommended starting dose of 
lenvatinib is 10 mg taken once daily. Please refer to the SmPC for pembrolizumab for dosing in 
patients with hepatic impairment. Further dose adjustments may be necessary on the basis of 
individual tolerability. The combination should be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
only if the anticipated benefit exceeds the risk (see section 4.8). 
No data for the combination of lenvatinib with everolimus are available in patients with hepatic 
impairment. No adjustment of starting dose of the combination is required on the basis of hepatic 
function in patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment. In 
patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, the recommended starting dose of lenvatinib 
is 10 mg taken once daily in combination with the dose of everolimus recommended for patients with 
severe hepatic impairment in the SmPC for everolimus. Further dose adjustments may be necessary on 
the basis of individual tolerability. The combination should be used in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment only if the anticipated benefit exceeds the risk (see section 4.8).  
Patients with renal impairment 
No adjustment of starting dose is required on the basis of renal function in patients with mild or 
moderate renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment, the recommended starting dose 
is 10 mg of lenvatinib taken once daily. Please refer to the SmPC for pembrolizumab or everolimus for 
dosing in patients with renal impairment. Further dose adjustments may be necessary based on 
individual tolerability. Patients with end-stage renal disease have not been studied, therefore the use of 
lenvatinib in these patients is not recommended (see section 4.8). 
Elderly population 
No  adjustment  of  starting  dose  is  required  on  the  basis  of  age.  Limited  data  are  available  on  use  in 
patients aged ≥75 years (see section 4.8).  
Paediatric population 
Lenvatinib should not be used in children younger than 2 years of age because of safety concerns 
identified in animal studies (see section 5.3). The safety and efficacy of lenvatinib in children aged 
2 to <18 years have not yet been established (see section 5.1). No data are available. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ethnic Origin 
No adjustment of starting dose is required on the basis of race (see section 5.2). Currently available 
data are described in section 4.8). 
Body weight below 60 kg 
No adjustment of starting dose is required on the basis of body weight. Limited data are available on 
treatment with lenvatinib in combination with everolimus in patients with a body weight below 60 kg 
with RCC (see section 4.8). 
Performance status 
Patients with an ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status of 2 or higher were 
excluded from RCC Study 205 (see section 5.1). Patients with a KPS (Karnofsky Performance Status) 
<70 were excluded from Study 307 (CLEAR). Benefit-risk in these patients has not been evaluated. 
Method of administration 
Lenvatinib is for oral use. The capsules should be taken at about the same time each day, with or 
without food (see section 5.2). Caregivers should not open the capsule, in order to avoid repeated 
exposure to the contents of the capsule.  
Lenvatinib capsules can be swallowed whole with water or administered as a suspension prepared by 
dispersing the whole capsule(s) in water, apple juice, or milk. The suspension may be administered 
orally or via a feeding tube. If administered via a feeding tube, then the suspension should be prepared 
using water (see section 6.6 for preparation and administration of suspension).  
If not used at the time of preparation, lenvatinib suspension may be stored in a covered container and 
must be refrigerated at 2ºC to 8ºC for a maximum of 24 hours. After removal from the refrigerator the 
suspension should be shaken for approximately 30 seconds before use. If not administered within 24 
hours, the suspension should be discarded. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Breast-feeding (see section 4.6).  
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hypertension 
Hypertension has been reported in patients treated with lenvatinib, usually occurring early in the 
course of treatment (see section 4.8). Blood pressure (BP) should be well controlled prior to treatment 
with lenvatinib and, if patients are known to be hypertensive, they should be on a stable dose of 
antihypertensive therapy for at least 1 week prior to treatment with lenvatinib. Serious complications 
of poorly controlled hypertension, including aortic dissection, have been reported. The early detection 
and effective management of hypertension are important to minimise the need for lenvatinib dose 
interruptions and reductions. Antihypertensive agents should be started as soon as elevated BP is 
confirmed. BP should be monitored after 1 week of treatment with lenvatinib, then every 2 weeks for 
the first 2 months, and monthly thereafter. The choice of antihypertensive treatment should be 
individualised to the patient’s clinical circumstances and follow standard medical practice. For 
previously normotensive patients, monotherapy with one of the classes of antihypertensive should be 
started when elevated BP is observed. For those patients already on an antihypertensive medicinal 
product, the dose of the current agent may be increased, if appropriate, or one or more agents of a 
different class of antihypertensive should be added. When necessary, manage hypertension as 
recommended in Table 3.

2.  When systolic BP ≤150 mmHg, diastolic BP 
≤95 mmHg, and patient has been on a stable dose 
of antihypertensive therapy for at least 48 hours, 
resume lenvatinib at a reduced dose (see 
section 4.2) 
Life-threatening consequences 
(malignant hypertension, neurological deficit, or 
hypertensive crisis) 
Urgent intervention is indicated. Discontinue lenvatinib 
and institute appropriate medical management. 
Aneurysms and artery dissections 
The use of VEGF pathway inhibitors in patients with or without hypertension may promote the 
formation of aneurysms and/or artery dissections. Before initiating lenvatinib, this risk should be 
carefully considered in patients with risk factors such as hypertension or history of aneurysm. 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraception while taking lenvatinib and 
for one month after stopping treatment (see section 4.6). It is currently unknown if lenvatinib increases 
the risk of thromboembolic events when combined with oral contraceptives. 
Proteinuria 
Proteinuria has been reported in patients treated with lenvatinib, usually occurring early in the course 
of treatment (see section 4.8). Urine protein should be monitored regularly. If urine dipstick 
proteinuria ≥2+ is detected, dose interruptions, adjustments, or discontinuation may be necessary (see 
section 4.2). Cases of nephrotic syndrome have been reported in patients using lenvatinib. Lenvatinib 
should be discontinued in the event of nephrotic syndrome. 
Renal failure and impairment 
Renal impairment and renal failure have been reported in patients treated with lenvatinib (see 
section 4.8). The primary risk factor identified was dehydration and/or hypovolemia due to 
gastrointestinal toxicity. Gastrointestinal toxicity should be actively managed in order to reduce the 
risk of development of renal impairment or renal failure. Caution should be taken in patients receiving 
agents acting on the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system given a potentially higher risk for acute 
renal failure with the combination treatment. Dose interruptions, adjustments, or discontinuation may 
be necessary (see section 4.2). 
If patients have severe renal impairment, the initial dose of lenvatinib should be adjusted (see 
sections 4.2 and 5.2).

Cardiac dysfunction 
Cardiac failure (<1%) and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction have been reported in patients 
treated with lenvatinib (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for clinical symptoms or signs 
of cardiac decompensation, as dose interruptions, adjustments, or discontinuation may be necessary 
(see section 4.2). 
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) / Reversible posterior leucoencephalopathy 
syndrome (RPLS) 
PRES, also known as RPLS, has been reported in patients treated with lenvatinib (<1%; see 
section 4.8). PRES is a neurological disorder which can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, 
confusion, altered mental function, blindness, and other visual or neurological disturbances. Mild to 
severe hypertension may be present. Magnetic resonance imaging is necessary to confirm the 
diagnosis of PRES. Appropriate measures should be taken to control blood pressure (see section 4.4, 
Hypertension). In patients with signs or symptoms of PRES, dose interruptions, adjustments, or 
discontinuation may be necessary (see section 4.2). 
Hepatotoxicity 
Liver-related adverse reactions most commonly reported in patients treated with lenvatinib included 
increases in alanine aminotransferase, increases in aspartate aminotransferase, and increases in blood 
bilirubin. Hepatic failure and acute hepatitis (<1%; see section 4.8) have been reported in patients 
treated with lenvatinib. The hepatic failure cases were generally reported in patients with progressive 
liver metastases. Liver function tests should be monitored before initiation of treatment, then every 
2 weeks for the first 2 months and monthly thereafter during treatment. In the case of hepatotoxicity, 
dose interruptions, adjustments, or discontinuation may be necessary (see section 4.2). 
If patients have severe hepatic impairment, the initial dose of lenvatinib should be adjusted (see 
sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Arterial thromboembolisms 
Arterial thromboembolisms (cerebrovascular accident, transient ischaemic attack, and myocardial 
infarction) have been reported in patients treated with lenvatinib (see section 4.8). Lenvatinib has not 
been studied in patients who have had an arterial thromboembolism within the previous 6 months, and 
therefore should be used with caution in such patients. A treatment decision should be made based 
upon an assessment of the individual patient's benefit/risk. Lenvatinib should be discontinued 
following an arterial thrombotic event. 
Haemorrhage 
Serious tumour related bleeds, including fatal haemorrhagic events have occurred in clinical trials and 
have been reported in post-marketing experience (see section 4.8). In post-marketing surveillance, 
serious and fatal carotid artery haemorrhages were seen more frequently in patients with anaplastic 
thyroid carcinoma (ATC) than in DTC or other tumour types. The degree of tumour 
invasion/infiltration of major blood vessels (e.g. carotid artery) should be considered because of the 
potential risk of severe haemorrhage associated with tumour shrinkage/necrosis following lenvatinib 
therapy. Some cases of bleeding have occurred secondarily to tumour shrinkage and fistula formation, 
e.g. tracheo-oesophageal fistulae. Cases of fatal intracranial haemorrhage have been reported in some 
patients with or without brain metastases. Bleeding in sites other than the brain (e.g. trachea, 
intra-abdominal, lung) has also been reported.  
In the case of bleeding, dose interruptions, adjustments, or discontinuation may be required (see 
section 4.2, Table 2). 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gastrointestinal perforation and fistula formation 
Gastrointestinal perforation or fistulae have been reported in patients treated with lenvatinib (see 
section 4.8). In most cases, gastrointestinal perforation and fistulae occurred in patients with risk 
factors such as prior surgery or radiotherapy. In the case of a gastrointestinal perforation or fistula, 
dose interruptions, adjustments, or discontinuation may be necessary (see section 4.2). 
Non-gastrointestinal fistula 
Patients may be at increased risk for the development of fistulae when treated with lenvatinib. Cases 
of fistula formation or enlargement that involve other areas of the body than stomach or intestines 
were observed in clinical trials and in post-marketing experience (e.g. tracheal, tracheo-oesophageal, 
oesophageal, cutaneous, female genital tract fistulae). In addition, pneumothorax has been reported 
with and without clear evidence of a bronchopleural fistula. Some reports of fistula and pneumothorax 
occurred in association with tumour regression or necrosis. Prior surgery and radiotherapy may be 
contributing risk factors. Lung metastases may also increase the risk of pneumothorax. Lenvatinib 
should not be started in patients with fistulae to avoid worsening and lenvatinib should be permanently 
discontinued in patients with oesophageal or tracheobronchial tract involvement and any Grade 4 
fistula (see section 4.2); limited information is available on the use of dose interruption or reduction in 
management of other events, but worsening was observed in some cases and caution should be taken. 
Lenvatinib may adversely affect the wound healing process as do other agents of the same class. 
QT interval prolongation 
QT/QTc interval prolongation has been reported at a higher incidence in patients treated with 
lenvatinib than in patients treated with placebo (see section 4.8). Electrocardiograms should be 
monitored in all patients with a special attention for those with congenital long QT syndrome, 
congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmics, and those taking medicinal products known to prolong the 
QT interval, including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics. Lenvatinib should be withheld in the event of 
development of QT interval prolongation greater than 500 ms. Lenvatinib should be resumed at a 
reduced dose when QTc prolongation is resolved to < 480 ms or baseline. 
Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia, or hypomagnesaemia increase the risk 
of QT prolongation; therefore electrolyte abnormalities should be monitored and corrected in all 
patients before starting treatment. Periodic monitoring of ECG and electrolytes (magnesium, 
potassium and calcium) should be considered during treatment. Blood calcium levels should be 
monitored at least monthly and calcium should be replaced as necessary during lenvatinib treatment. 
Lenvatinib dose should be interrupted or dose adjusted as necessary depending on severity, presence 
of ECG changes, and persistence of hypocalcaemia. 
Impairment of thyroid stimulating hormone suppression / Thyroid dysfunction 
Hypothyroidism has been reported in patients treated with lenvatinib (see section 4.8). Thyroid 
function should be monitored before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment with 
lenvatinib. Hypothyroidism should be treated according to standard medical practice to maintain 
euthyroid state. 
Lenvatinib impairs exogenous thyroid suppression (see section 4.8). Thyroid stimulating hormone 
(TSH) levels should be monitored on a regular basis and thyroid hormone administration should be 
adjusted to reach appropriate TSH levels, according to the patient’s therapeutic target. 
Diarrhoea 
Diarrhoea has been reported frequently in patients treated with lenvatinib, usually occurring early in 
the course of treatment (see section 4.8). Prompt medical management of diarrhoea should be 
instituted in order to prevent dehydration. Lenvatinib should be discontinued in the event of 
persistence of Grade 4 diarrhoea despite medical management. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Wound healing complications 
No formal studies of the effect of lenvatinib on wound healing have been conducted. Impaired wound 
healing has been reported in patients receiving lenvatinib. Temporary interruption of lenvatinib should 
be considered in patients undergoing major surgical procedures. There is limited clinical experience 
regarding the timing of reinitiation of lenvatinib following a major surgical procedure. Therefore, the 
decision to resume lenvatinib following a major surgical procedure should be based on clinical 
judgment of adequate wound healing. 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) 
Cases of ONJ have been reported in patients treated with lenvatinib. Some cases were reported in 
patients who had received prior or concomitant treatment with antiresorptive bone therapy, and/or 
other angiogenesis inhibitors, e.g. bevacizumab, TKI, mTOR inhibitors. Caution should therefore be 
exercised when lenvatinib is used either simultaneously or sequentially with antiresorptive therapy 
and/or other angiogenesis inhibitors. 
Invasive dental procedures are an identified risk factor. Prior to treatment with lenvatinib, a dental 
examination and appropriate preventive dentistry should be considered. In patients who have 
previously received or are receiving intravenous bisphosphonates, invasive dental procedures should 
be avoided if possible (see section 4.8). 
Special populations 
Limited data are available for patients of ethnic origin other than Caucasian or Asian, and in patients 
aged ≥75 years. Lenvatinib should be used with caution in such patients, given the reduced tolerability 
of lenvatinib in Asian and elderly patients (see section 4.8). 
There are no data on the use of lenvatinib immediately following sorafenib or other anticancer 
treatments and there may be a potential risk for additive toxicities unless there is an adequate washout 
period between treatments. The minimal washout period in clinical trials was of 4 weeks. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Effect of other medicinal products on lenvatinib 
Chemotherapeutic agents 
Concomitant administration of lenvatinib, carboplatin, and paclitaxel has no significant impact on the 
pharmacokinetics of any of these 3 substances. Additionally, in patients with RCC the 
pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib was not significantly affected by concomitant everolimus. 
Effect of lenvatinib on other medicinal products 
CYP3A4 substrates 
A clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) study in cancer patients showed that plasma concentrations of 
midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A and Pgp substrate) were not altered in the presence of lenvatinib. 
Additionally, in patients with RCC the pharmacokinetics of everolimus was not significantly affected 
by concomitant lenvatinib. No significant drug-drug interaction is therefore expected between 
lenvatinib and other CYP3A4/Pgp substrates.

Oral contraceptives 
It is currently unknown whether lenvatinib may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, 
and therefore women using oral hormonal contraceptives should add a barrier method (see 
section 4.6). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/ Contraception in females 
Women of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant and use highly effective 
contraception while on treatment with lenvatinib and for at least one month after finishing treatment. It 
is currently unknown whether lenvatinib may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, and 
therefore women using oral hormonal contraceptives should add a barrier method. 
Pregnancy 
There are no data on the use of lenvatinib in pregnant women. Lenvatinib was embryotoxic and 
teratogenic when administered to rats and rabbits (see section 5.3). 
Lenvatinib should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary and after a careful 
consideration of the needs of the mother and the risk to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether lenvatinib is excreted in human milk. Lenvatinib and its metabolites are 
excreted in rat milk (see section 5.3).  
A risk to newborns or infants cannot be excluded and, therefore, lenvatinib is contraindicated during 
breast-feeding (see section 4.3). 
Fertility 
Effects in humans are unknown. However, testicular and ovarian toxicity has been observed in rats, 
dogs, and monkeys (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Lenvatinib has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines, due to undesirable effects 
such as fatigue and dizziness. Patients who experience these symptoms should use caution when 
driving or operating machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety profile of lenvatinib is based on pooled data from 497 RCC patients treated with lenvatinib 
in combination with pembrolizumab, including Study 307 (CLEAR); pooled data from 623 RCC 
patients treated with lenvatinib in combination with everolimus: 458 DTC patients and 496 HCC 
patients treated with lenvatinib as monotherapy.

patients in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab-treated group and 93.1% of patients in the sunitinib-
treated group had baseline TSH levels ≤ upper limit of normal. Elevations of TSH > upper limit of 
normal were observed post baseline in 85.0% of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab-treated patients versus 
65.6% of sunitinib-treated patients. In lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab-treated patients, hypothyroidism 
events resulted in dose modification of lenvatinib (reduction or interruption) in 2.6% patients and 
discontinuation of lenvatinib in 1 patient. 
In the pooled RCC population treated with lenvatinib and everolimus, hypothyroidism occurred in 
24.1% of patients. In general, the majority of hypothyroidism events were of Grade 1 or 2. Grade 3

palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome, proteinuria and hypothyroidism (including blood 
thyroid hormone increased) while Caucasian patients had a higher incidence of fatigue, nausea, 
arthralgia, vomiting, and asthenia. 
In the pooled RCC population treated with lenvatinib and everolimus, Asian patients had a higher 
(≥10% difference) incidence than Caucasian patients of hypothyroidism, stomatitis, platelet count 
decreased, proteinuria, dysphonia, PPE and hypertension while Caucasian patients had a higher 
incidence of nausea, asthenia, fatigue and hypercholesterolemia. 
Baseline hypertension

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The highest doses of lenvatinib studied clinically were 32 mg and 40 mg per day. Accidental 
medication errors resulting in single doses of 40 to 48 mg have also occurred in clinical trials. The 
most frequently observed adverse drug reactions at these doses were hypertension, nausea, diarrhea, 
fatigue, stomatitis, proteinuria, headache, and aggravation of PPE. There have also been reports of 
overdose with lenvatinib involving single administrations of 6 to 10 times the recommended daily 
dose. These cases were associated with adverse reactions consistent with the known safety profile of 
lenvatinib (i.e., renal and cardiac failure), or were without adverse reactions. 
There is no specific antidote for overdose with lenvatinib. In case of suspected overdose, lenvatinib 
should be withheld and appropriate supportive care given as required.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EX08 
Mechanism of action 
Lenvatinib is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that selectively inhibits the kinase activities of 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and 
VEGFR3 (FLT4), in addition to other proangiogenic and oncogenic pathway-related RTKs including 
fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4, the platelet derived growth factor 
(PDGF) receptor PDGFRα, KIT, and RET. In syngeneic mouse tumour models, lenvatinib decreased 
tumour-associated macrophages, increased activated cytotoxic T cells, and demonstrated greater 
antitumour activity in combination with an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody compared to either 
treatment alone. 
The combination of lenvatinib and everolimus showed increased antiangiogenic and antitumour 
activity as demonstrated by decreased human endothelial cell proliferation, tube formation, and VEGF 
signalling in vitro and tumour volume in mouse xenograft models of human renal cell cancer greater 
than each substance alone. 
Although not studied directly with lenvatinib, the mechanism of action (MOA) for hypertension is 
postulated to be mediated by the inhibition of VEGFR2 in vascular endothelial cells. Similarly, 
although not studied directly, the MOA for proteinuria is postulated to be mediated by downregulation 
of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 in the podocytes of the glomerulus. 
The mechanism of action for hypothyroidism is not fully elucidated. 
The mechanism of action for the worsening of hypercholesterolemia with the combination of 
lenvatinib and everolimus has not been studied directly and is not fully elucidated. 
Although not studied directly, the MOA for the worsening of diarrhoea with the combination of 
lenvatinib and everolimus is postulated to be mediated by the impairment of intestinal function related 
to the MOAs for the individual agents – VEGF/VEGFR and c-KIT inhibition by lenvatinib coupled 
with mTOR/NHE3 inhibition by everolimus.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
First-line treatment of patients with RCC (in combination with pembrolizumab)  
The efficacy of lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab was investigated in Study 307 
(CLEAR), a multicentre, open-label, randomized trial that enrolled 1069 patients with advanced RCC 
with clear cell component including other histological features such as sarcomatoid and papillary in 
the first-line setting. Patients were enrolled regardless of PD-L1 tumour expression status. Patients 
with active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were 
ineligible. Randomisation was stratified by geographic region. (North America and Western Europe 
versus “Rest of the World”) and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) prognostic 
groups (favourable, intermediate and poor risk). 
Patients were randomized to lenvatinib 20 mg orally once daily in combination with pembrolizumab 
200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks (n=355), or lenvatinib 18 mg orally once daily in combination 
with everolimus 5 mg orally once daily (n=357), or sunitinib 50 mg orally once daily for 4 weeks then 
off treatment for 2 weeks (n=357). All patients on the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm were started 
on lenvatinib 20 mg orally once daily. The median time to first dose reduction for lenvatinib was 1.9 
months. The median average daily dose for lenvatinib was 14 mg. Treatment continued until 
unacceptable toxicity or disease progression as determined by the investigator and confirmed by 
independent radiologic review committee (IRC) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours 
Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). Administration of lenvatinib with pembrolizumab was permitted beyond 
RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and considered by the 
investigator to be deriving clinical benefit. Pembrolizumab was continued for a maximum of 24 
months; however, treatment with lenvatinib could be continued beyond 24 months. Assessment of 
tumour status was performed at baseline and then every 8 weeks. 
The study population (355 patients in the lenvatinib with pembrolizumab arm and 357 in the sunitinib 
arm) characteristics were: median age of 62 years (range: 29 to 88 years); 41% age 65 or older, 74% 
male; 75% White, 21% Asian, 1% Black, and 2% other races; 17% and 83% of patients had a baseline 
KPS of 70 to 80 and 90 to 100, respectively; patient distribution by IMDC (International Metastatic 
RCC Database Consortium) risk categories was 33% favourable, 56% intermediate and 10% poor, and 
MSKCC prognostic groups was 27% favourable, 64% intermediate and 9% poor. Metastatic disease 
was present in 99% of the patients and locally advanced disease was present in 1%. Common sites of 
metastases in patients were lung (69%), lymph node (46%), and bone (26%). 
The primary efficacy outcome measure was progression free survival (PFS) based on RECIST 1.1 per 
IRC. Key secondary efficacy outcome measures included overall survival (OS) and objective response 
rate (ORR). Lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab demonstrated statistically significant 
improvements in PFS, OS and ORR compared with sunitinib at the prespecified interim analysis (final 
analysis for PFS). The median PFS for lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab was 23.9 
months (95% CI: 20.8, 27.7) compared with 9.2 months (95% CI: 6.0, 11.0) for sunitinib, with HR 
0.39 (95% CI: 0.32, 0.49; P value <0.0001). For OS, HR was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.88; P value 
0.0049) with the median OS follow-up time of 26.5 months and the median duration of treatment for 
lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab of 17.0 months. The ORR for lenvatinib in combination with 
pembrolizumab was 71% (95% CI: 66, 76) vs 36% (95% CI: 31, 41) P value <0.0001 for sunitinib. 
Efficacy results for PFS, OS and ORR at the protocol-specified final analysis (median follow-up time 
of 49.4 months) are summarised in Table 5, Figure 1 and Figure 2. PFS results were consistent across 
pre-specified subgroups, MSKCC prognostic groups and PD-L1 tumour expression status. Efficacy 
results by MSKCC prognostic group are summarised in Table 6. 
The final OS analysis was not adjusted to account for subsequent therapies, with 195/357 (54.6%) 
patients in the sunitinib arm and 56/355 (15.8%) patients in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm 
receiving subsequent anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.

Second-line treatment of patients with RCC (in combination with everolimus)  
Study 205, a multicentre, randomised, open-label, trial was conducted to determine the safety and 
efficacy of lenvatinib administered alone or in combination with everolimus in patients with 
unresectable advanced or metastatic RCC. The study consisted of a Phase 1b dose finding and a 
Phase 2 portion. The Phase 1b portion included 11 patients who received the combination of 18 mg of 
lenvatinib plus 5 mg of everolimus. The Phase 2 portion enrolled a total of 153 patients with 
unresectable advanced or metastatic RCC following 1 prior VEGF-targeted treatment. A total of 
62 patients received the combination of lenvatinib and everolimus at the recommended dose. Patients 
were required, among others, to have histological confirmation of predominant clear cell RCC, 
radiographic evidence of disease progression according to RECIST 1.1, one prior VEGF-targeted 
therapy and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) of 0 or 1. 
Patients were randomly allocated to one of 3 arms: 18 mg of lenvatinib plus 5 mg of everolimus, 
24 mg of lenvatinib or 10 mg of everolimus using a 1:1:1 ratio. Patients were stratified by 
haemoglobin level (≤13 g/dL vs. >13 g/dL for males and ≤11.5 g/dL vs >11.5 g/dL for females) and 
corrected serum calcium (≥10 mg/dL vs. <10 mg/dL). The median of average daily dose in the 
combination arm per patient was 13.5 mg of lenvatinib (75.0% of the intended dose of 18 mg) and 
4.7 mg of everolimus (93.6% of the intended dose of 5 mg). The final dose level in the combination 
arm was 18 mg for 29% of patients, 14 mg for 31% of patients, 10 mg for 23% of patients, 8 mg for 
16% of patients and 4 mg for 2% of patients. 
Of the 153 patients randomly allocated, 73% were male, the median age was 61 years, 37% were 
65 years or older, 7% were 75 years or older, and 97% were Caucasian. Metastases were present in 
95% of the patients and unresectable advanced disease was present in 5%. All patients had a baseline 
ECOG PS of either 0 (55%) or 1 (45%) with similar distribution across the 3 treatment arms. 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre (MSKCC) poor risk was observed in 39% of patients in the 
lenvatinib plus everolimus arm, 44% in the lenvatinib arm and 38% in the everolimus arm. 
International mRCC Database Consortium (IMDC) poor risk was observed in 20% of patients in the 
lenvatinib plus everolimus arm, 23% in the lenvatinib arm, and 24% in the everolimus arm. The 
median time from diagnosis to first dose was 32 months in the lenvatinib plus everolimus-treatment 
arm, 33 months in the lenvatinib arm and 26 months in the everolimus arm. All patients had been 
treated with 1 prior VEGF-inhibitor; 65% with sunitinib, 23% with pazopanib, 4% with tivozanib, 3% 
with bevacizumab, and 2% each with sorafenib or axitinib. 
The primary efficacy outcome measure, based on investigator assessed tumour response, was PFS of 
the lenvatinib plus everolimus arm vs the everolimus arm and of the lenvatinib arm vs the everolimus 
arm. Other efficacy outcome measures included OS and investigator-assessed ORR. Tumour 
assessments were evaluated according to RECIST 1.1.  
26 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The lenvatinib plus everolimus arm showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 
improvement in PFS compared with the everolimus arm (see Table 7 and Figure 3). Based on the 
results of a post-hoc exploratory analysis in a limited number of patients per subgroup, the positive 
effect on PFS was seen regardless of which prior VEGF-targeted therapy was used: sunitinib (Hazard 
ratio [HR] = 0.356 [95% CI: 0.188, 0.674] or other therapies (HR = 0.350 [95% CI: 0.148, 0.828]). 
The lenvatinib arm also showed an improvement in PFS compared with the everolimus arm. Overall 
survival was longer in the lenvatinib plus everolimus arm (see Table 7 and Figure 4). The study was 
not powered for the OS analysis. 
The treatment effect of the combination on PFS and ORR was also supported by a post-hoc 
retrospective independent blinded review of scans. The lenvatinib plus everolimus arm showed a 
statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS compared with the everolimus 
arm. Results for ORR were consistent with that of the investigators’ assessments, 35.3% in the 
lenvatinib plus everolimus arm, with one complete response and 17 partial responses; no patient had 
an objective response in the everolimus arm (P < 0.0001) in favour of the lenvatinib plus everolimus 
arm.

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
lenvatinib in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma 
(RCC) (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Pharmacokinetic  parameters  of  lenvatinib  have  been  studied  in  healthy  adult subjects,  adult subjects 
with hepatic impairment, renal impairment, and solid tumours. 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Absorption 
Lenvatinib is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with tmax typically observed from 1 to 4 hours 
postdose. Food does not affect the extent of absorption, but slows the rate of absorption. When 
administered with food to healthy subjects, peak plasma concentrations are delayed by 2 hours. 
Absolute bioavailability has not been determined in humans; however, data from a mass-balance study 
suggests that it is in the order of 85%. 
Distribution 
In vitro binding of lenvatinib to human plasma proteins is high and ranged from 98% to 99% 
(0.3 - 30 μg/mL, mesilate). This binding was mainly to albumin with minor binding to α1-acid 
glycoprotein and γ-globulin. A similar plasma protein binding (97% to 99%) with no dependencies on 
lenvatinib concentrations (0.2 to 1.2 μg/mL) was observed in plasma from hepatically impaired, 
renally impaired, and matching healthy subjects. 
In vitro, the lenvatinib blood-to-plasma concentration ratio ranged from 0.589 to 0.608 
(0.1 – 10 μg/mL, mesilate). 
In vitro studies indicate that lenvatinib is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP. Lenvatinib shows minimal or 
no inhibitory activities toward P-gp mediated and BCRP mediated transport activities. Similarly, no 
induction of P-gp mRNA expression was observed. Lenvatinib is not a substrate for OAT1, OAT3, 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, or the BSEP. In human liver cytosol, lenvatinib did not inhibit 
aldehyde oxidase activity. 
In patients, the median apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of the first dose ranged from 50.5 L to 
92 L and was generally consistent across the dose groups from 3.2 mg to 32 mg. The analogous 
median apparent volume of distribution at steady-state (Vz/Fss) was also generally consistent and 
ranged from 43.2 L to 121 L. 
Biotransformation 
In vitro, cytochrome P450 3A4 was demonstrated as the predominant (>80%) isoform involved in the 
P450-mediated metabolism of lenvatinib. However, in vivo data indicated that non-P450-mediated 
pathways contributed to a significant portion of the overall metabolism of lenvatinib. Consequently, in 
vivo, inducers and inhibitors of CYP 3A4 had a minimal effect on lenvatinib exposure (see 
section 4.5). 
In human liver microsomes, the demethylated form of lenvatinib (M2) was identified as the main 
metabolite. M2’ and M3’, the major metabolites in human faeces, were formed from M2 and 
lenvatinib, respectively, by aldehyde oxidase. 
In plasma samples collected up to 24 hours after administration, lenvatinib constituted 97% of the 
radioactivity in plasma radiochromatograms while the M2 metabolite accounted for an additional 
2.5%. Based on AUC(0 – inf), lenvatinib accounted for 60% and 64% of the total radioactivity in plasma 
and blood, respectively. 
Data from a human mass balance/excretion study indicate lenvatinib is extensively metabolised in 
humans. The main metabolic pathways in humans were identified as oxidation by aldehyde oxidase, 
demethylation via CYP3A4, glutathione conjugation with elimination of the O-aryl group 
(chlorophenyl moiety), and combinations of these pathways followed by further biotransformations 
(e.g., glucuronidation, hydrolysis of the glutathione moiety, degradation of the cysteine moiety, and 
intramolecular rearrangement of the cysteinylglycine and cysteine conjugates with subsequent 
dimerisation). These in vivo metabolic routes align with the data provided in the in vitro studies using 
human biomaterials.

In vitro transporter studies 
Please see distribution section. 
Elimination 
Plasma concentrations decline bi-exponentially following Cmax. The mean terminal exponential 
half-life of lenvatinib is approximately 28 hours. 
Following administration of radiolabelled lenvatinib to 6 patients with solid tumours, approximately 
two-thirds and one-fourth of the radiolabel were eliminated in the faeces and urine, respectively. The 
M3 metabolite was the predominant analyte in excreta (~17% of the dose), followed by M2’ (~11% of 
the dose) and M2 (~4.4 of the dose). 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Dose proportionality and accumulation 
In patients with solid tumours administered single and multiple doses of lenvatinib once daily, 
exposure to lenvatinib (Cmax and AUC) increased in direct proportion to the administered dose over the 
range of 3.2 to 32 mg once-daily. 
Lenvatinib displays minimimal accumulation at steady state. Over this range, the median accumulation 
index (Rac) ranged from 0.96 (20 mg) to 1.54 (6.4 mg). 
Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib following a single 10-mg dose were evaluated in 6 subjects each 
with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A and Child-Pugh B, respectively). A 5-mg 
dose was evaluated in 6 subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). Eight healthy, 
demographically matched subjects served as controls and received a 10-mg dose. The median half-life 
was comparable in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment as well as those with 
normal hepatic function and ranged from 26 hours to 31 hours. The percentage of the dose of 
lenvatinib excreted in urine was low in all cohorts (<2.16% across treatment cohorts). 
Lenvatinib exposure, based on dose-adjusted AUC(0-t) and AUC(0-inf) data, was 119%, 107%, and 180% 
of normal for subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment, respectively. It has been 
determined that plasma protein binding in plasma from hepatically impaired subjects was similar to 
the respective matched healthy subjects and no concentration dependency was observed. See 
section 4.2 for dosing recommendation. 
Renal impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib following a single 24-mg dose were evaluated in 6 subjects each 
with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, and compared with 8 healthy, demographically 
matched subjects. Subjects with end-stage renal disease were not studied. 
Lenvatinib exposure, based on AUC(0-inf) data, was 101%, 90%, and 122% of normal for subjects with 
mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively. It has been determined that plasma protein 
binding in plasma from renally impaired subjects was similar to the respective matched healthy 
subjects and no concentration dependency was observed. See section 4.2 for dosing recommendation. 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Age, sex, weight, ethnic origin 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients receiving up to 24 mg lenvatinib once 
daily, age, sex, weight, and race (Japanese vs. other, Caucasian vs. other) had no significant effects on 
clearance (see section 4.2). 
Paediatric population 
Paediatric patients have not been studied. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In the repeated-dose toxicity studies (up to 39 weeks), lenvatinib caused toxicologic changes in 
various organs and tissues related to the expected pharmacologic effects of lenvatinib including 
glomerulopathy, testicular hypocellularity, ovarian follicular atresia, gastrointestinal changes, bone 
changes, changes to the adrenals (rats and dogs), and arterial (arterial fibrinoid necrosis, medial 
degeneration, or haemorrhage) lesions in rats, dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys. Elevated transaminase 
levels asociated with signs of hepatotoxicity, were also observed in rats, dogs and monkeys. 
Reversibility of the toxicologic changes was observed at the end of a 4-week recovery period in all 
animal species investigated. 
Genotoxicity 
Lenvatinib was not genotoxic. 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with lenvatinib. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
No specific studies with lenvatinib have been conducted in animals to evaluate the effect on fertility. 
However, testicular (hypocellularity of the seminiferous epithelium) and ovarian changes (follicular 
atresia) were observed in repeated-dose toxicity studies in animals at exposures 11 to 15 times (rat) or 
0.6 to 7 times (monkey) the anticipated clinical exposure (based on AUC) at the maximum tolerated 
human dose. These findings were reversible at the end of a 4-week recovery period. 
Administration of lenvatinib during organogenesis resulted in embryolethality and teratogenicity in 
rats (foetal external and skeletal anomalies) at exposures below the clinical exposure (based on AUC) 
at the maximum tolerated human dose, and rabbits (foetal external, visceral or skeletal anomalies) 
based on body surface area; mg/m2 at the maximum tolerated human dose. These findings indicate that 
lenvatinib has a teratogenic potential, likely related to the pharmacologic activity of lenvatinib as an 
antiangiogenic agent. 
Lenvatinib and its metabolites are excreted in rat milk.  
Juvenile animal toxicity studies 
Mortality was the dose-limiting toxicity in juvenile rats in which dosing was initiated on postnatal day 
(PND) 7 or PND21 and was observed at exposures that were respectively 125- or 12-fold lower 
compared with the exposure at which mortality was observed in adult rats, suggesting an increasing 
sensitivity to toxicity with decreasing age. Therefore mortality may be attributed to complications 
related to primary duodenal lesions with possible contribution from additional toxicities in immature 
target organs. 
The toxicity of lenvatinib was more prominent in younger rats (dosing initiated on PND7) compared 
with those with dosing initiated on PND21 and mortality and some toxicities were observed earlier in 
the juvenile rats at 10 mg/kg compared with adult rats administered the same dose level. Growth 
retardation, secondary delay of physical development, and lesions attributable to pharmacologic 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
effects (incisors, femur [epiphyseal growth plate], kidneys, adrenals, and duodenum) were also 
observed in juvenile rats.

1.  What Kisplyx is and what it is used for 
What Kisplyx is 
Kisplyx is a medicine that contains the active substance lenvatinib. It is used in combination with 
pembrolizumab as the first treatment for adults with advanced kidney cancer (advanced renal cell 
carcinoma). It is also used in combination with everolimus to treat adults with advanced kidney cancer 
where other treatments (so-called “VEGF-targeted therapy”) have not helped stop the disease. 
How Kisplyx works 
Kisplyx blocks the action of proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which are involved in 
the development of new blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to cells and help them to grow. 
These proteins can be present in high amounts in cancer cells, and by blocking their action Kisplyx 
may slow the rate at which the cancer cells multiply and the tumour grows and help to cut off the 
blood supply that the cancer needs.

are over 75 years old 
belong to an ethnic group other than White or Asian  
weigh less than 60 kg 
have a history of abnormal passageways (known as a fistula) between different organs in the 
body or from an organ to the skin

tear in a blood vessel wall. 
have or have had pain in the mouth, teeth and/or jaw, swelling or sores inside the mouth, 
numbness or a feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth. You may be advised to 
have a dental check-up before starting Kisplyx as bone damage in the jaw (osteonecrosis) has 
been reported in patients treated with Kisplyx. If you need to undergo an invasive dental 
treatment or dental surgery, tell your dentist that you are being treated with Kisplyx, particularly 
when you are also receiving or have received injections of bisphosphonates (used to treat or 
prevent bone disorders). 
are receiving or have received some medicines used to treat osteoporosis (antiresorptive 
medicines) or cancer medicines which alter formation of blood vessels (so called angiogenesis 
inhibitors), as the risk of bone damage in the jaw may be increased. 
Before taking Kisplyx, your doctor may carry out some blood tests, for example to check your blood 
pressure and your liver or kidney function and to see if you have low levels of salt and high levels of 
thyroid stimulating hormone in your blood. Your doctor will discuss the results of these tests with you 
and decide whether you can be given Kisplyx. You may need to have additional treatment with other 
medicines, to take a lower dose of Kisplyx, or to take extra care due to an increased risk of side 
effects. 
If you are not sure talk to your doctor before taking Kisplyx.

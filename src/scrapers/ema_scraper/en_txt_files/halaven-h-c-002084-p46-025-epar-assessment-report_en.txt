1.  Introduction 
On 2nd August 2021, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for eribulin (Halaven), in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH confirms that Study E7389-G000-223 is part of the clinical development program for eribulin 
and is Study 8 in the approved Paediatric Investigation Plan (EMEA-001261-PIP01-11-M06).

Halaven 0.44 mg/mL solution for injection (marketed formulation) 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
•  Study E7389-G000-223 (Study 223) – A Phase 2, multicenter, open-label study to assess 
safety and preliminary activity of eribulin mesylate in paediatric subjects with 
relapsed/refractory rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma 
(NRSTS) and Ewing sarcoma (EWS) 
The MAH suggests that the data submitted does not change the risk-benefit balance of eribulin and 
there is no regulatory consequence. 
Eribulin is a microtubule dynamics inhibitor belonging to the halichondrin class of antineoplastic agents. 
It was first approved in the EU in March 2011. It is currently approved for use in adult patients with 
previously treated locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, or previously treated unresectable 
liposarcoma.  
Study 223 is part of the paediatric investigation plan (PIP) for eribulin. The PIP includes one additional 
clinical study, Study 113, which has been finalised and was submitted in March 2019, in a P46 
procedure. Study 113 was a Phase 1 study of eribulin in children with refractory or recurrent solid 
tumours (excluding central nervous system [CNS]), including lymphomas. Information from Study 113 
was intended to help determine appropriate dosing in children with refractory or recurrent solid 
tumours, and to evaluate safety, toxicity and pharmacokinetics (PK). The maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) for eribulin was concluded to be 1.4 mg/m2. The best overall response was partial response (PR) 
for 1 subject and stable disease (SD) for 3 subjects. As it was an open, single-arm study investigating 
different doses in different histologies, and with few subjects included, no assessment of efficacy could 
be made, but it was concluded that the overall activity of eribulin in paediatric solid tumours seemed 
low. 
 
 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study E7389-G000-223 (Study 223):  
A Phase 2, multicenter, open-label study to assess safety and preliminary activity of eribulin 
mesylate in pediatric subjects with relapsed/refractory rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), non-
rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma (NRSTS) and Ewing sarcoma (EWS) 
Description 
Study 223 was an open-label, single-arm, multicentre study of eribulin mesylate in paediatric subjects 
with recurrent or refractory relapsed/refractory RMS, NRSTS or EWS, to assess preliminary activity in 
these three histologies.  Eligible subjects ≥12 months and <18 years of age were eligible for 
enrolment. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The primary aim of the study was to conduct a preliminary assessment of activity of eribulin mesylate 
in paediatric subjects with relapsed/refractory RMS, NRSTS or EWS to determine whether each cohort 
warrants further investigation. 
Study design 
The study consisted of 3 Phases: the Pre-study Phase, the Treatment Phase and the Follow-up Phase.  
- 
- 
The Pre-study Phase (Days -28 to -1) included assessments before the first dose of study drug 
to establish eligibility and baseline values.  
The Treatment Phase started on Day 1 of Cycle 1. Study treatment was discontinued if there 
was evidence of progressive disease or toxicity that required removal from treatment. Study 
treatment may otherwise have continued provided the subject had at least SD, met laboratory 
parameters defined in the eligibility criteria and did not meet any of the criteria for removal 
from protocol therapy or study discontinuation criteria. Subjects were followed for adverse 
events (AEs) for 28 days from the last dose of eribulin mesylate or until resolution of the 
events (for serious adverse events [SAEs], if resolution was unlikely, subjects were followed up 
until the event or sequelae stabilised). 
- 
The Follow-Up period began immediately after the End-of-Treatment visit and until death or 
informed consent was withdrawn unless the study was terminated by the sponsor. Subjects 
were followed for survival approximately every 12 weeks for 1 year and annually thereafter. 
During the Follow-Up period, subjects who had discontinued study treatment without 
progression should have had tumour assessments every 6 to 12 weeks, at the investigator’s 
discretion, from the date of last tumour assessment until disease progression was documented, 
death, or initiation of another anticancer therapy, whichever occurred first, unless the study 
was terminated by the sponsor. Follow-up data were required unless consent was withdrawn. 
Study population  
Paediatric subjects (age ≥12 months and <18 years) were eligible to take part in the study if they had 
histologically confirmed, relapsed or refractory RMS, NRSTS (Grade 2 or 3), or EWS and measurable 
disease meeting protocol-specified criteria, and with performance score ≥50 in Karnofsky or Lansky 
scale.  
Subjects were not included in the study if they had >Grade 1 peripheral sensory neuropathy or 
>Grade 1 peripheral motor neuropathy (Modified [“Balis”] Pediatric Scale of Peripheral Neuropathies), 
protocol-specified cardiac pathology or CNS disease, or any serious concomitant illness that in the 
opinion of the investigator(s) could have affected the subject’s safety or interfered with the study 
assessments. 
Treatments 
Study subjects were treated at the recommended Phase 2 dose (paediatric) of 1.4 mg/m2, 
administered intravenously on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. 
Comment: The recommended dose for adults is 1.23 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 2 to 5 
minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle (Halaven SmPC).  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary objective of the study was: 
• 
To conduct a preliminary assessment of activity of eribulin mesylate in paediatric subjects with 
relapsed/refractory RMS, NRSTS or EWS to determine whether each cohort warrants further 
investigation. 
The secondary objectives of the study were: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS), using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, of eribulin mesylate in paediatric subjects with relapsed/refractory RMS, 
NRSTS, or EWS in all cohorts combined. 
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of eribulin in the paediatric subjects with 
relapsed/refractory RMS, NRSTS, or EWS in all cohorts combined. 
To evaluate the duration of response (DOR) of eribulin mesylate in paediatric subjects with 
relapsed/refractory RMS, NRSTS, or EWS. 
To evaluate the overall survival (OS) of paediatric subjects with relapsed/refractory RMS, 
NRSTS and EWS. 
Statistical Methods 
Primary endpoint:  
Objective response:  number of subjects achieving a best overall response of PR or complete response 
(CR), by up to 24 weeks after all subjects had completed response assessment.  Response assessment 
was determined by investigators. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 23 subjects were enrolled; 21 subjects were treated (8 subjects each in the RMS and NRSTS 
groups and 5 subjects in the EWS group) with eribulin mesylate at a dose of 1.4 mg/m2.  
All 21 subjects had discontinued treatment at the time of the data cutoff (22 Feb 2021); 19 subjects 
died, and 2 subjects were still in survival follow-up. The most frequent reasons for discontinuation 
were radiologic disease progression in 15 subjects (71.4%), clinical disease progression in 4 subjects 
(19.0%) and AEs in 2 subjects (9.5%). 
All 21 treated subjects were included in the Full Analysis Set and Safety Analysis Set (primary analysis 
sets used for efficacy analysis and safety analysis sets, respectively).  
Enrolment in the study was discontinued early due to lack of antitumor activity, following consultation 
with investigators and health authorities. 
Baseline data 
The median age of subjects was 13.0 years old (range: 2.0 to 17.0 years) and 13 of 21 subjects 
(61.9%) were between 12 and 17 years of age. Most subjects were male (14 [66.7%]) and white (11 
[52.4%]) and a smaller proportion (5 [23.8%]) were of Black or African American descent. With the 
exception of 1 subject, all subjects had Lansky play score or Karnofsky performance status score of 70 
or above at baseline. 
Efficacy results 
After treatment with eribulin mesylate, 6 subjects (28.6%) in total with RMS (n=3), NRSTS (n=1), or 
EWS (n=2) had a best overall response of SD and 12 (57.1%) subjects had a best overall response of 
progressive disease. No subjects achieved CR or PR (Table 1).  
At the time of data cutoff (22 Feb 2021), the median PFS per RECIST 1.1 assessed by the investigator 
for the overall population was 1.41 months (95% CI: 0.76, 1.74). The Kaplan-Meier estimated PFS 
rate was 16.5% at 3 months and 0.0% at 6 months. At the time of data cutoff, 19 subjects (90.5%) 
had died. The median OS was 6.01 months (95% CI: 2.86, 8.51). The OS rate was 52.4% at 6 
months, 16.3% at 12 months, and 10.9% at 18 and 24 months. 
The aim of this study was to assess the preliminary efficacy of eribulin mesylate in paediatric subjects 
with RMS, EWS and NRSTS. After more than 15 subjects had been enrolled and treated, with at least 5 
subjects treated per histology, no confirmed PR or CR was observed. Enrolment to the study was 
discontinued due to lack of antitumor activity, following consultation with investigators and health 
authorities.

Safety results 
Exposure 
At the time of the data cutoff date for this report (22 Feb 2021), the median overall duration of eribulin 
treatment was 6.0 weeks (range: 3.0 to 22.1 weeks). (Table 2).

Adverse events 
 
 
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as those AEs that occurred (or worsened if 
present at Baseline) after the first dose of study drug through 28 days after the last dose of study 
drug. 
All subjects reported at least 1 TEAE. The most commonly reported TEAEs (in 50% or more subjects) 
were neutrophil count decreased (71.4%), anaemia (66.7%) and white blood cell count decreased 
(61.9%). There were no reported TEAEs related to COVID-19 by the time of the data cutoff (22 Feb 
2021). 
Treatment-emergent adverse events of Grade 3 or higher were reported in 18 subjects (85.7%). The 
most commonly reported (in 20% or more subjects) Grade 3 or higher TEAEs were neutrophil count 
decreased (42.9%), white blood cell count decreased (38.1%) and anaemia (28.6%). Six of the 
8 subjects who had TEAEs of Grade 3 or higher of white blood cell count decreased had also TEAEs of 
neutrophil count decreased. 
Treatment-related adverse events 
Treatment-related TEAEs were reported in 20 subjects (95.2%). Thirteen subjects (61.9%) had 
treatment-related Grade 3 or higher TEAEs; the most frequently reported treatment-related severe 
TEAEs (in 10% or more subjects) were neutrophil count decreased (38.1%), white blood cell count 
decreased (33.3%), anaemia (19.0%) and neutropenia (14.3%). 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Overall, 11 subjects (52.4%) had at least 1 treatment-emergent SAE (fatal or nonfatal). Fatal 
treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in 3 subjects (14.3%) and were malignant neoplasm 
progression (2 subjects) and respiratory failure (1 subject); all 3 events were considered by the 
investigator to be related to disease progression.  
The most frequent nonfatal treatment-emergent SAEs reported in 2 or more subjects were Grade 1 to 
3 pyrexia (3 subjects, 14.3%) and 1 Grade 1 and 1 Grade 3 events of malignant pleural effusion (2 
subjects, 9.5%). 
Adverse events of special interest 
The clinical overview specifically discussed AEs of alopecia, neutropenia, and peripheral neuropathy, as 
they can be noted with cytotoxic chemotherapy such as eribulin. In addition, events of QT prolongation 
were described.  
-  A total of 7 subjects (33.3%) had a TEAE of alopecia; 5 of these TEAEs were related to eribulin. 
Of the 7 TEAEs of alopecia, 6 were Grade 1 and 1 was Grade 2. By the time of the cutoff date 
for the primary analysis, 3 events of alopecia were resolving or resolved, 3 events did not 
resolve and for 1 event there was no reported outcome. 
-  A total of 17 subjects (81.0%) had both TEAEs of neutropenia and neutrophil count decreased 
of all grades. The majority of the events were related to eribulin and resolved or were resolving 
at the time of this report. Ten subjects (47.6%) had both TEAEs of neutropenia and neutrophil 
count decreased of Grade 3 or higher; 1 (4.8%) of those subjects had treatment-related, 
treatment-emergent SAEs of neutropenia which resolved after study drug interruption.  
- 
Two subjects (9.5%) had treatment-related TEAEs of peripheral neuropathy: 1 subject had 
Grade 2 TEAEs of peripheral motor neuropathy and peripheral sensory neuropathy (both 
resolved) and 1 subject had a Grade 2 TEAE of peripheral sensory neuropathy (not resolved at 
the time of data cutoff). One subject (4.8%) had 2 events of Grade 3 neuralgia, a preferred 
term that belongs to Standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Query (narrow 
scope) of peripheral neuropathy. The events of severe neuralgia were assessed as related to 
study treatment and resolved with dose reduction (first event) and eribulin discontinuation 
(second event). 
-  Six subjects (28.6%) had Grade 1 TEAEs of ECG QT prolongation; in 2 of these subjects the 
TEAEs were assessed as related to study treatment. All TEAEs of QT prolongation resolved. 
One subject had treatment-emergent SAEs of Grade 3 pericardial effusion, Grade 3 left 
ventricular dysfunction, and Grade 4 cardiac tamponade assessed as not related to eribulin, 
which resolved. 
Adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation 
In total, 3 subjects (14.3%) discontinued eribulin due to TEAEs; all of these subjects had at least 1 
Grade 3 TEAE leading to discontinuation of eribulin. The TEAEs that led to study drug discontinuation 
were alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, blood alkaline 
phosphatase increased, blood bilirubin increased (all in 1 subject), muscle weakness and neuralgia (in 
1 subject each). All except 1 TEAE (a treatment-emergent SAE of neuralgia) leading to drug withdrawal 
were assessed as not related to eribulin. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Currently, the Halaven SmPC states the following regarding paediatric use:  
Section 4.2 
Paediatric population  
There is no relevant use of HALAVEN in children and adolescents for the indication of breast 
cancer.  
The safety and efficacy of HALAVEN in children from birth to 18 years of age have not yet been 
established in soft tissue sarcoma. No data are available. 
Section 5.1 
Paediatric population  
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
eribulin in all subsets of the paediatric population in the indication of breast cancer (see section 
4.2 for information on paediatric use).  
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
HALAVEN in one or more subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment of 
rhabdomyosarcoma and non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma. See section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use. 
None of the 21 subjects treated with eribulin monotherapy achieved PR or CR in Study 223. Due to the 
lack of responses, enrolment was discontinued early. The MAH’s conclusion is agreed, i.e., that these 
results do not support further clinical development of eribulin monotherapy as a potential antitumor 
treatment strategy in paediatric subjects with relapsed/refractory RMS, NRSTS or EWS. 
The safety profile of eribulin was consistent to that observed in adult subjects; no new safety signals 
were identified. The safety population is, however, small and the treatment duration was short. Based 
on this study, no firm conclusions can be drawn from a safety perspective, regarding the use of eribulin 
in a paediatric population.  
The MAH suggests that the final report of this study does not warrant an update of the SmPC. 
However, according to the paediatric regulation (EC) No 1901/2006), results from paediatric studies, 
even when there is lack of activity, should be included in the SmPC to provide guidance for the 
prescribers. Furthermore, the current text on deferral of studies with HALAVEN in one or more subsets 
of the paediatric population for the treatment of paediatric RMS and NRSTS should be amended to 
reflect finalisation of Study 223. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The efficacy results of Study 223 do not support further clinical development of eribulin monotherapy 
in paediatric subjects with relapsed/refractory RMS, NRSTS or EWS. Due to the limited safety 
database, no conclusions on safety of eribulin monotherapy in paediatric patients can be drawn.  
The SmPC should be updated with a brief description of the results of study 223, and the current texts 
on deferral of paediatric studies and lack of data should be updated to reflect finalisation of the study, 
as detailed below.   
The PAM is considered 
  Fulfilled: 
In view of the available data regarding antitumour activity of eribulin in paediatric patients with 
relapsed/refractory RMS, NRSTS or EWS the MAH should either submit a variation in accordance with 
Articles 16 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 or provide a justification for not doing so. This 
should be provided without any delay and no later than 60 days after the receipt of these 
conclusions.  
-  Section 5.1 of the SmPC should be updated with a brief description of the results of Study 223 
(number of patients, the diagnoses included and that no responses were seen). 
- 
The current deferral information in section 5.1 should be updated to reflect finalisation of the 
study.  
-  Section 4.2 (paragraph on paediatric soft tissue sarcoma) should be updated by replacing the 
text ‘No data are available’ with a reference to section 5.1.

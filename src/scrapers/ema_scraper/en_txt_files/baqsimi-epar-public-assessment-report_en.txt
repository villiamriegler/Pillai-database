2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication is: 
“Baqsimi is indicated for the treatment of severe hypoglycaemia in adults, adolescents, and children aged 
4 years and over with diabetes mellitus.” 
Severe hypoglycemia is an episode of hypoglycemia that causes neurological impairment and requires the 
assistance from another person to actively administer carbohydrates, glucagon, or take other corrective 
actions (IHSG 2015). 
Episodes of severe hypoglycemia are characterized by neurological impairment that, if left untreated, can 
lead to serious consequences, such as loss of consciousness, seizures, coma, adverse cardiovascular 
outcomes, and even death. Injectable glucagon is a safe and efficacious emergency treatment for severe 
hypoglycemia and is currently the only treatment option for patients and their caregivers outside of the 
hospital or emergency medical setting. However, practical considerations, such as the multistep 
preparation of the solution for administration and injection by untrained users, have limited the use of 
injectable glucagon and can lead to delays in treatment and increased use of costly emergency medical 
services. 
Peptide hormones are typically administered via a parenteral route such as intravenous, intramuscular, or 
subcutaneous. Oral administration is not practical since they undergo digestion and inactivation in the 
gastrointestinal tract and significant first pass metabolism, resulting in significant loss of efficacy. To 
overcome the usability challenges of injectable therapy and preserve efficacy, intranasal administration of 
peptide hormones has been studied. Known examples of intranasal peptides include desmopressin, 
oxytocin, and calcitonin. Nasal delivery of glucagon has previously been shown to increase blood glucose 
concentration in healthy subjects and patients with T1D. This application describes the clinical 
development of nasal glucagon (NG) and supports the use of Lilly’s NG as an improvement in the delivery 
of treatment for the serious condition of severe hypoglycemia.

2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Severe hypoglycemia is one of the most significant complications of diabetes treatment, occurring more 
frequently in patients with profound endogenous insulin deficiency—type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) and 
advanced type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Glucagon increases blood glucose concentration by activating hepatic glucagon receptors, thereby 
stimulating glycogen breakdown and release of glucose from the liver. Hepatic stores of glycogen are 
necessary for glucagon to produce an antihypoglycemic effect. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Severe hypoglycemia has serious clinical implications for patients with T1D or T2D, including: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
death. Based upon recent reports of mortality rates, it is estimated that 4% to 10% of all deaths 
in patients with T1D can be attributed to hypoglycemia). NICE-SUGAR Study Investigators (2012) 
reported an increased risk of death in critically ill patients. 
seizures and loss of consciousness associated with hypoglycemia, which have been reported by 
approximately 1 in 9 participants in the T1D Exchange registry in the US. 
cognitive impairment (for example, difficulty concentrating, confusion, incoordination), 
drowsiness, weakness, and behavior changes secondary to neuroglycopenia, which can lead to 
more serious consequences including seizures, coma, and even death. Cognitive impairment can 
lead to other adverse outcomes such as falls, fractures, or motor vehicle accidents. 
serious cardiac complications such as arrhythmias. 
impaired hypoglycemic awareness following repeated episodes of hypoglycaemia, which can 
increase the risk for more severe hypoglycemic episodes. 
prevention of optimal glycemic control, due to fear or avoidance of hypoglycemia. 
decreased quality of life due to interference with employment, personal relationships, and other 
activities and possible onset or acceleration of dementia or cognitive decline. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Currently available treatments for severe hypoglycemia are limited to intravenous dextrose and injectable 
glucagon. Intravenous dextrose requires administration by trained personnel within a hospital or 
emergency medical setting; thus, injectable glucagon is the only treatment option for caregivers outside 
of these settings. However, injectable glucagon is currently not available in a ready-to-use formulation. 
Glucagon is unstable in the aqueous state, therefore, the glucagon powder in currently available glucagon 
emergency kits must be reconstituted using a multiple-step process before the drug can be administered 
to the patient by either subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. Specifically, the instructions for use 
state that caregivers must remove the flip-off seal from the vial of glucagon, wipe the rubber stopper with 
an alcohol swab (Glucagon for Injection only), remove the needle protector from the syringe and inject 
the entire contents into the vial of glucagon, swirl the vial until the glucagon is completely dissolved, 
withdraw all of the solution, remove air bubbles from the syringe (GlucaGen HypoKit only), cleanse the 
injection site (Glucagon for Injection only), insert the needle into the skin to inject glucagon, and then 
withdraw the needle and press on the injection site. This process may delay or even preclude treatment, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/602404/2019 
Page 10/116 
  
  
 
 
especially in emergencies when caregivers without medical training must treat patients having a severe 
hypoglycemic event. Adding to this multiple-step process of administration, the caregiver may also need 
to determine if a weight-based dose adjustment is necessary for pediatric patients (Glucagon for Injection 
Product Monograph, 2012; GlucaGen HypoKit UK SmPC, 2015; GlucaGen HypoKit USPI, 2015; GlucaGen 
HypoKit Product Monograph, 2016; Glucagon for Injection USPI, 2017). In addition to these complexities, 
there are challenges associated with any type of injectable therapy including unfamiliarity with needles 
and syringes as well as a common fear of needles which could prevent effective administration of 
injectable glucagon. 
Although few clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate usability issues, available evidence 
suggests that people without medical training find it challenging to administer injectable glucagon in an 
emergency, more than two-thirds (69%) of the parents of children and adolescents with diabetes had 
difficulty reconstituting and injecting glucagon with the emergency kit (difficulties included opening the 
pack, sheath removal, mixing, bent needles), even though the parents were familiar with injection 
techniques and had been trained to administer injectable glucagon. In some circumstances (10%), these 
difficulties led to the caregiver aborting the injection or inadvertently not administering any glucagon at 
all. During episodes of severe hypoglycemia, delays or errors in injectable glucagon administration may 
have a significant negative impact on patient outcomes. 
All of these challenges likely contribute to the underutilization of injectable glucagon. In a study using a 
questionnaire to assess the coping strategies of 102 patients with T1D, 83% of patients said they had 
received instructions on how to use the injectable glucagon emergency kit but only 60% of patients 
actually owned one. Furthermore, of those patients who had experienced an episode of severe 
hypoglycemia, only 19% used the injectable glucagon emergency kit. More recently, Mitchell et al. (2016) 
examined the glucagon prescription pattern of patients with T1D or T2D who were newly prescribed 
insulin and found that the proportion of prescriptions filled was low, but varied with the type of insulin 
therapy and type of diabetes. Although the reason(s) that patients filled or did not fill the glucagon 
prescriptions were not known, these data further support that injectable glucagon is underutilized. 
Additionally, the US emergency medical service has policies restricting the use of injectable medications, 
including glucagon, by emergency medical technicians in many states. 
Nasal glucagon provides easy administration of glucagon via a ready to use needle-free device, could 
represent an improvement in the evolution of the treatment of severe hypoglycaemia outside of the 
hospital or emergency medical setting. 
About the product 
Nasal glucagon (NG; LY900018; formerly known as AMG504-1 [originally developed by A.M.G Medical 
Inc. and later by Locemia Solutions ULC]) is a drug/device combination product containing a novel, 
nasally administered glucagon powder intended for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in adult and 
pediatric patients with diabetes. A 3 mg dose of ready-to-use NG dry powder, which does not require 
reconstitution, is administered by inserting the tip of the single use device into the patient’s nostril and 
depressing the plunger to expel the glucagon powder into the nostril where it is passively absorbed in the 
anterior nasal mucosa. Patients do not need to inhale or breathe deeply after dosing, enabling drug 
delivery even in unconscious patients. 
Glucagon increases blood glucose concentration by activating hepatic glucagon receptors, thereby 
stimulating glycogen breakdown and release of glucose from the liver. Hepatic stores of glycogen are 
necessary for glucagon to produce an antihypoglycemic effect. Glucagon has been used clinically in the 
treatment of severe hypoglycaemia since the 1950s, and glucagon for injection (produced from animal 
sources) was first approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) in 1960. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/602404/2019 
Page 11/116 
  
  
 
 
Recombinant glucagon was approved for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in the 1990s. Currently, 
the injectable Glucagon for Injection emergency kit (Eli Lilly and Company [Lilly]) is approved in the US 
and Canada, and the injectable GlucaGen HypoKit (Novo Nordisk) is approved in the US, European Union 
(EU), and Canada for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia. 
The primary sequence of glucagon is highly conserved in mammals and is identical in man, cattle, pigs, 
dogs, and rats. The synthetic glucagon peptide is structurally identical to naturally occurring human 
glucagon as well as glucagon extracted from beef and pork pancreas. The drug substance in NG is 
synthetic glucagon which is the same single-chain, 29 amino acid polypeptide as the recombinant 
glucagon used in currently marketed glucagon emergency kits. The NG commercial drug product contains 
a dry powder formulation, which consists of synthetic glucagon and uses a novel excipient, the 
phospholipid dodecylphosphocholine (DPC), as a surfactant and absorption enhancer, and 
beta-cyclodextrin (β-CD) as a filler/bulking agent and absorption enhancer. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
To address the need for an improved method of glucagon delivery, a clinical development was conducted 
to evaluate the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of NG, as well as to characterize NG pharmacokinetics 
(PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD). 
In addition, the Sponsor has completed a comprehensive nonclinical program including studies to 
evaluate the novel route of administration and the novel excipient DPC in accordance with published 
guidance and previous regulatory advice. 
Nasal glucagon was originally developed by A.M.G Medical Inc. (AMG Medical) and later by Locemia 
Solutions ULC (Locemia) prior to acquisition by Lilly in 2015.  The clinical development program for NG 
was comprehensive and is generally aligned with regulatory guidance. Adult patients with T1D or T2D, 
pediatric patients with T1D, and their caregivers were included in the development program in order to 
assess the drug product in the intended patient populations in both randomized controlled trials and 
real-world settings. The NG development program provides adequate exposure in both adult and pediatric 
patients using a combination of pivotal, bridging and confirmatory, actual use, and other supportive 
studies to allow conclusions to be drawn on the efficacy, PK/PD, and safety of NG.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Glucagon is a synthetic linear 29-amino acid peptide with a free amino group at the N-terminus and a free 
carboxylic acid at the C-terminus.  
The chemical name of glucagon is 
L-Histidyl-L-seryl-L-glutaminyl-glycyl-L-threonyl-L-phenylalanyl-L-threonyl-L-seryl-L-aspartyl-L-tyrosyl
-L-seryl-L-lysyl-L-tyrosyl-L-leucyl-L-aspartyl-L-seryl-L-arginyl-L-arginyl-L-alanyl-L-glutaminyl-L-asparty
l-L-phenylalanyl-L-valyl-L-glutaminyl-L-tryptophanyl-L-leucyl-L-methionyl-L-asparaginyl-L-threonine 
corresponding to the molecular formula C153H225N43O49S. It has a monoisotopic mass of 3480.6 g/mol and 
the following structure: 
Figure 1: Active substance structure 
The chemical structure of glucagon was elucidated by a combination of methods including different mass 
spectrometric (MS) techniques and circular dichroism (UV CD). The solid state properties of the active 
substance were measured by different methods, including powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), raman 
spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). 
The active substance is a very hygroscopic, amorphous white powder, freely soluble in ammonium 
hydroxide and very slightly soluble in water.  
All optically active amino acids are in L-configuration, glycine residue is achiral.  The contents of the 
D-isomers of amino acids have been determined in three commercial batches of glucagon by a GC-MS 
technique upon hydrolysis of the active substance with hydrochloric acid.  
Polymorphism has not been observed for the active substance.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured in one manufacturing site. 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised.

The  active  substance  is  packaged  in  wide-neck  bottles  made  of  amber  glass  (hydrolytic  type  III 
soda-lime-silica glass) which complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual), appearance of solution (visual), 
identification (HPLC, amino acid analysis, MS), related substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), water content 
(KF), acetic acid content (IC), ammonium content (IC), chloride content (potentiometric titration), 
residual organic solvents (GC), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and  microbial limit test (TAMC, TYMC, Ph. 
Eur.).  
The applicant has provided a justification for all the tests and acceptance criteria in the specifications 
based on the relevant compendial and regulatory requirements. The specification was developed by 
following the recommendations of the ICH guidelines Q3C, Q6A, M7, the Ph. Eur. general monograph, the 
Glucagon EP monograph and the Glucagon USP monograph and is considered appropriate. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and where necessary, appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used for assay and identification testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data of 5 commercial batches of the active substance are provided. The results are within 
the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 60 months under long term conditions (-20 °C and 
5 °C) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH and 40 °C/75% RH) according 
to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, purity and related substances (total and 
individual), chloride content, ammonium content and water content.  
All tested parameters were within their specified limits after 60 month storage at -20 °C and 5 °C, and 
during 6 month storage at 25 °C/60% RH. However, a significant degradation of glucagon, a significant 
increase of related substances and a significant decrease of corrected assay values were observed during 
storage at the accelerated storage condition of 40 °C/75% RH. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. It has been shown 
that the active substance is sensitive towards irradiation with a dose of 1.2 Million lux hours (Mlxh) and is 
highly sensitive towards irradiation with a dose of 6 Mlxh. 
Results on stress conditions to evaluate the influence of temperature and moisture in solid state  and 
hygroscopicity were also provided on one batch.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months when stored in a 
freezer (< -15 °C) in the original container in order to protect from light.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Baqsimi 3mg nasal powder is a white to off-white, freeze-dried powder to be administered to the nasal 
mucosa via a single-use delivery device.  
The finished product was designed to meet the needs of patients with hypoglycemia based on the Quality 
Target Product Profile (QTPP).  
The Critical quality attributes (CQAs) for the finished product, which are necessary to ensure that the 
patient receives the desired outcome from use of the product include identification, description, potency, 
purity and combination product functionality. 
Nasal glucagon, intended for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in adult and pediatric patients, is a 
novel drug/device combination product consisting of a single use nasal dosing device that delivers 
glucagon powder for absorption via the nasal mucosa. 
Glucagon is a naturally occurring hormone produced by the pancreas. Glucagon is known to be prone to 
self-association or aggregation. The process used to manufacture nasal glucagon was developed to 
minimize the potential for aggregation. The process has been shown to effectively inhibit aggregation 
while the glucagon is in solution. 
The choice of the excipients has been justified. The excipients (except novel excipient: 
dodecylphosphocholine) are of Ph. Eur. quality. Information on dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) is included 
below. No compatibility issues between the active substance and the excipients or between the excipients 
themselves have been observed during development and stability studies.  The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The novel excipient used in the manufacture of nasal glucagon is DPC. DPC is a structural analogue of 
lauroyl lysophosphatidylcholine and is more stable to hydrolytic degradation than other excipients. DPC 
has been shown to improve paracellular permeability of hydrophilic compounds by modulating the tight 
junctions, which may have implications on its use for oral or nasal drug delivery. DPC is a surfactant and 
absorption enhancer. DPC is an appropriate choice as the surfactant in this formulation.  Detailed 
information on the manufacturing and control of DPC was requested by the CHMP during the assessment 
procedure and the provided data was considered satisfactory. 
β-cyclodextrin is used to provide bulk or structure to the lyophilized material, and also acts as an 
absorption enhancer. It can have a positive influence on glucagon solution stability as well as enhance 
mucosal permeation in the formulation. 
The nasal glucagon finished product provides a ready-to-use (no reconstitution) dry powder formulation 
for absorption via the nasal mucosa as an alternative to injection of a freeze-dried and reconstituted 
formulation. The formulation used during clinical studies is the same as that intended for marketing. 
The selection of the manufacturing process flow and unit operations with their process parameters (target 
values) is justified and is based on scientific principles, early process development and ability to control 
finished product properties.  
A risk-based approach was used for the development of the manufacturing process. The risk assessment 
focused on the potential influence of manufacturing unit operations on CQA of the finished product. 
Individual unit operations were evaluated by Failure Mode Effect and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) risk 
assessment and the outcome was based on early process development (process characterization data) 
and prior knowledge. As a result of the initial risk assessment, one factor at the time (OFAT) experiments 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/602404/2019 
Page 15/116 
  
  
 
 
were performed to study the impact of process parameters and to mitigate risks. A comprehensive 
discussion of the results is given which supports the proven acceptable ranges (PAR) for critical and 
non-critical process variables. Risk of interaction among process parameters is deemed small. Compliance 
with the CQAs is always fulfilled within the PARs investigated. Based on the experiments and initial risk 
assessment, a final risk assessment was performed.  
The product is packed in a primary container closed on one end with a centerpiece and on the opposite end 
with a ball.  A green stripe is printed onto the button of the device to indicate dose completion. The 
pre-filled device is stored in a rigid plastic tube with attached hinged cap containing a desiccant in order 
to protect the device from mechanical damage and the glucagon drug powder from moisture. The tube 
has a shrink band as indicator that the tube has not been opened.  
All packaging components comply with Food Contact EU Regulation No 10/2011. Since the finished 
product and the delivery device form a single integral product which is not reusable, the delivery device 
falls under the scope of the Medicinal Products Directive 2001/83/EC and not the Medical Device Directive 
93/42/EEC. The delivery device is not assessed by a Notified Body for CE mark. Conformance with the 
essential requirements of Annex I of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 has been demonstrated. The suitability of 
the packaging components for protection from light and moisture is supported with ICH (photo) stability 
studies, spectral transmission and water vapor transmission data. The primary container and delivery 
device have been evaluated with regard to extractables and leachables and the studies conclude that the 
observed leachable concentrations are of no toxicological relevance. The suitability of the packaging 
components for drug delivery has been studied with clinical and commercially representative batches.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of 10 unit operations.  The manufacturing process is a non-standard 
process.  
The manufacturing process has been validated with 3 consecutive production batches for formulation, 
product processing, combination product filling and combination product assembly. The functional 
secondary packaging process has been validated with 3 consecutive previously assembled product 
batches. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished 
product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this 
pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form: identity (RP-HPLC, peptide map), assay (RP-HPC), uniformity of dosage units (RP-HPLC), shot 
weight (mass), delivered dose uniformity (RP-HPLC), acetic acid (RP-HPLC), impurities (RP-HPLC), 
description (visual), water content (KF), β-Cyclodextrin Content (RP-HPLC),  dodecylphosphocholine 
content (RP-HPLC),  particle size distribution (laser diffraction), and aerodynamics particle size (cascade 
impaction). Only the stability indicating tests have shelf life specifications. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/602404/2019

The proposed release and shelf-life acceptance limits for fine particle fraction (FPF) and percent less than 
eleven (PLE) fraction for aerodynamic particle size, as determined by cascade impaction are established 
considering the commercially representative APSD results and CI method variability. Due to the limited 
number of batches available, the CHMP recommended to re-evaluate the finished product release and 
shelf-life acceptance limits for FPF and PLE after 30 batches have been manufactured using the 
commercial manufacturing process and 24 months of stability are available for the process validation and 
three additional commercial batches put into stability in Q1 2020. 
An elemental impurities risk assessment as per ICH Q3D (finished product approach) has been 
performed. The results are found below the control threshold (30% of PDE considering 30mg maximum 
daily finished product dose) for each elemental impurity of concern for inhalation products.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used has been 
presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 full commercial scale process validation batches confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of finished product stored for up to 24 months under long 
term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH, 30 ºC / 65% RH, 30 ºC / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) in both the upright and inverted orientations according to the 
ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  batches  of  medicinal  product  are  identical  to  those  proposed  for 
marketing and were packed in the functional secondary container proposed for marketing.  
In addition, long-term stability data are available for 4 supporting stability batches manufactured with the 
same unit formula as the representative clinical and development batches, stored for up to 20 months at 
30°C/65%  RH,  up  to  24  months  at  25°C/60%  RH  and  30°C/75%  RH,  and  for  up  to  6  months  at 
accelerated storage conditions (40°C/75% RH). 
The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
The real time stability results meet the established acceptance criteria whatever the storage orientations.  
Stress stability studies were performed studying the effect of high temperature and humidity  and solution 
stress. The thermal/humidity stress testing study performed on bulk drug powder showed expected 
degradation products formed with storage at an elevated temperature and humidity and demonstrated 
that the packaged combination product provides effective protection for humidity. 
In addition, 1 batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New 
Drug Substances and Products. The photostability study, performed on representative bulk finished 
product showed light-induced degradation products as a result of the direct exposure to simulated 
sunlight conditions. The studies showed that the packaged combination product (combination product in 
the functional secondary packaging) provides effective protection, and therefore is considered photo 
stable.

Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months and do not store above 30 °C as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. Keep glucagon nasal powder in the shrink wrapped tube 
until ready to use. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. This product is a novel drug/device combination product 
consisting of a single use nasal dosing device that delivers glucagon powder for absorption via the nasal 
mucosa instead of the traditional parenteral administration. The results of tests carried out indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product and their 
manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process of the 
active substance, nor for the finished product 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was a minor unresolved quality issue having no impact on the 
Benefit/Risk ratio of the product (see 2.2.6 Recommendation). 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
- to re-evaluate the finished product release and shelf-life acceptance limits for FPF and PLE after 30 
batches have been manufactured using the commercial manufacturing process and 24 months of stability 
are available for the process validation and three additional commercial batches put into stability in Q1 
2020. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Nasal glucagon is classified as an antihypoglycaemic drug, glucagon receptor agonist. Glucagon is a 
polypeptide hormone, containing 29 amino acids. The physiologic effect of both endogenous and 
exogenously administered glucagon is to raise the concentration of blood glucose. Glucagon increases 
blood glucose concentration by activating hepatic glucagon receptors, thereby stimulating glycogen 
breakdown and release of glucose from the liver. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/602404/2019 
Page 18/116 
  
  
 
 
Glucagon has additional pharmacological effects. In the GI tract, it inhibits tone and motility of stomach, 
duodenum and small/large intestines. It increases bile flow, and decreases secretion of digestive 
enzymes. It also increases blood flow in the abdominal region.  
Furthermore, glucagon induces the release of catecholamines (adrenal glands). It has a positive 
chronotropic and inotropic action. It slightly reduces the calcium serum levels, and induces the release of 
fatty acids. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Pharmacology  studies  were  conducted  to  characterize  Nasal  Glucagon  (NG).  NG  is  a  novel  powder 
formulation,  which  contains  the  drug  substance  glucagon,  and  two  excipients:  dodecylphosphocholine 
(DPC,  a  novel  excipient),  and  beta-cyclodextrin  (β-CD,  an  approved  excipient).  NG  is  intended  to  be 
administered  intra-nasally  using  a  single-use  nasal  dosing  device  for  the  treatment  of  severe 
hypoglycemia.  
The PD effects of glucagon are well known and the primary PD of NG was therefore limited to an in vivo 
study  conducted  in  dogs  and  comparing  the  intranasal  (IN)-administered  drug  to  a  commercialised 
subcutaneously (SC) injectable glucagon. This was done in the frame of a combined PK/PD study. 
The  objective  of  the  study  was  to  determine  the  effect  of  different  dose  levels  of  an  intranasally 
administered  powder  glucagon  formulation  (AMG504-1)  and  injected  glucagon  on  blood  glucose  and 
blood glucagon levels in beagle dogs. Two groups of six dogs were used in this study. At one site (ITR), 
dogs were dosed with glucagon by SC injection (1 mg) and crossed-over to intranasal treatment with a 
0.5 mg dose of AMG504-1. At a second site, dogs were dosed intranasally with AMG504-1 at the 1 mg and 
2 mg glucagon dose levels. 
Data showed that the lowest dose of glucagon, 0.5 mg IN, only slightly increased the blood glucose level 
that did not exceed the upper normal range of 6mM. In contrast, 1 mg and 2 mg glucagon IN caused a 
clear glucose excursion with a peak at around 20 min after injection. The glucose response with 1 mg 
glucagon IN was somewhat smaller than with 1 mg SC. Though this study suggested comparable efficacy 
of NG as compared to commercially available sc formulation of glucagon, inconsistent values for Tonset of 
glucose excursion were reported. However, Tonset was calculated the same way for all these studies. It 
is explained by the variability of the animal responses observed in the 0.5 mg glucagon IN study. Indeed, 
in contrast to other studies in which all the animals responded to treatment, in the 0.5 mg glucagon IN 
study, some animals did not respond (i.e. blood glucose concentration did not cross the threshold which 
defines onset). 
In addition, three animals (1 dog in the 1 mg IN group and 2 dogs in the 2mg IN group) were improperly 
dosed with the IN route. The device was not used properly in that it was pushed quite tightly against the 
medial or lateral nasal mucosa instead of being directed into the lumen of the nasal passage. The powder 
was therefore not freely expelled from the device and much of the dose remained plugged in the external 
aperture of the device. These dogs clearly did not receive the intended dose. The anatomy of the canine 
nasal  cavity  (small  vestibule  due  to  the  presence  of  ventral  and  dorstal  atrioturbinates)  favours 
mechanical problems of administration. Considering the anatomical difference in human vs canine nasal 
cavity, it is unlikely that tight obstruction of the device opening occurs in humans.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In view of the well-known PD profile of glucagon, no dedicated secondary pharmacology studies were 
performed with NG that is acceptable. Yet, off-target effects were investigated in the 28-day toxicity study 
in dogs. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
All the safety pharmacology studies were conducted in compliance with GLP. 
The evaluation of the potential effects of nasal glucagon on the cardiovascular system was included in the 
28-day repeat-dose toxicity study in dogs. The NOEL for NG on the cardiovascular system in dogs was 4 
mg/dog.  
In the 28-day repeat-dose toxicity, with the exception of transient salivation and some sneezing in most 
dogs  immediately  after  intranasal  dosing,  there  were  no  excipient-  or nasal  glucagon-related  adverse 
clinical signs in respiratory or central nervous system function. 
DPC, the novel excipient, was also assessed for potential adverse effects in the cardiovascular, respiratory 
and central nervous systems.  
IV administration of 5 mg DPC (100x the clinical intended dose, based on body weight) to dogs did not 
show any adverse finding on the cardiovascular function but effects, albeit small, were noted on several 
cardiovascular parameters including a shortening of the QTc interval and a prolongation of the PQ interval 
as  well  as  a  mild,  transient,  and  reversible  increase  in  blood  pressure  that  was  highly  variable  and 
unexpectedly high around the time of administration in all groups. No specific reason for the small but 
consistent changes in CV parameters in response to the excipient DPC could be provided. Blood pressure 
increase was also noted in a small number of patients following Baqsimi administration (see clinical AR). 
It  is  not  known  whether  this  was  due  to  pharmacological  action  of  DPC  or  due  to  the  administration 
procedure. The changes were small and transient and therefore are not considered a cause for concern. 
Regarding the procedure-related BP increase in dogs, it is acknowledged that any handling can cause 
vegetative responses in the animals. It is expected that the relevance for humans of these findings is low 
because the product will not be used chronically. 
IN administration of 30 mg DPC (60x the clinical intended dose, based on body weight) to dogs showed a 
mild increase in respiratory rate and minute volume. Furthermore, dogs showed a transient salivation, 
sneezing and clear frothy nasal discharge. A NOEL was not identified. 
IN administration of 30 mg DPC (60x the clinical intended dose) to dogs did not show any neurological 
adverse effects. The NOEL was 30 mg/dog. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No non-clinical pharmacodynamics drug interaction studies were conducted with NG. Absence of 
pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies is acceptable since glucagon is a well-established substance. 
It is not expected that the known potential interactions, which are systemic, differ between the IM and the 
intranasal preparation. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) and toxicokinetics (TK) of NG glucagon were evaluated following single-dose 
IN  administration  in  dogs  and  repeat-dose  administration  in  rats  and  dogs.  For  all  studies,  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/602404/2019 
Page 20/116 
  
  
 
 
concentrations  of  immunoreactive  glucagon  were  determined  by  validated  radioimmunoassay  (RIA) 
methods. The NG formulation also contains β-CD as a filler/bulking agent/absorption enhancer and DPC 
as an absorption enhancer/surfactant. The PK profile of the novel excipient DPC was determined in rats 
and dogs following IV and IN administration of DPC to support the DPC toxicology studies. 
Following a single-dose IN administration of NG (from 0.5 to 2 mg) in dogs, Cmax and AUC of glucagon 
increased more than dose proportionally. Tmax was achieved in 10 minutes. T1/2 ranged from 15 to 57 
minutes. The relative bioavailability of 1 mg IN-administered glucagon compared to SC administration 
was 15%. 
Glucagon toxicokinetics was studied following once daily IN administration of NG in rats and dogs for 28 
days. Glucagon did not accumulate neither in rats nor in dogs over the 28-day treatment period. No sex 
difference  in  glucagon  exposure  was  observed,  for  both  animal  species.  The  NOEL  for  NG  on  the 
cardiovascular system in dogs was 4 mg/dog, which correspond to 1.28x (Day 1) and 2.25x (Day 28) 
multiple exposure based on Cmax for a therapeutic dose of 3 mg. The data do not indicate any concern that 
would be clinically relevant for the intended clinical dose. Also, in the 28-day repeat-dose toxicity studies 
with NG, the NOAEL for systemic target organ toxicity in the rat and in the dog was considered to be 0.2 
mg glucagon/day and 4 mg glucagon/day, respectively, corresponding to an exposure that is 10x and 
68x, respectively, the human AUC following the planned 3-mg synthetic glucagon IN dose.  
Additional data based upon NG distribution support the conclusions that NG does not enter the lung after 
IN administration of nasal glucagon. 
The  PK  profile  of  the  novel  excipient  DPC  was  studied  in  rats  and  dogs  following  a  single  IV  or  IN 
administration. DPC exposure increased with dose, almost proportionally for IN administration in both 
animal species. DPC bioavailability following IN administration was indeed found to be 38% in rats, and 
59% in dogs. T1/2 was 4 hours in rats, and 19 hours in dogs. 
•  Nonclinical tissue distribution, metabolism and excretion studies were not conducted with nasal 
glucagon. Interpretation of distribution studies with radiolabeled biologics are confounded by in 
vivo  metabolism,  release  of  label  from  the  peptide  following  degradation,  and  potential 
reincorporation of radiolabelled amino acids into the endogenous protein pool (ICH S6[R1]. 
•  Glucagon  is  a  peptide  and  presumed  to  be  degraded  into  component  amino  acids  by  general 
catabolism  pathways.  Therefore,  nonclinical  metabolism  studies  were  not  performed  (ICH 
S6[R1]). 
Furthermore,  no  metabolism  nor  excretion  studies  have  been  performed  with  DPC.  DPC  is  likely 
hydrolyzed  by  phospholipase  D  generating  alkyl  phosphates  and  choline,  which  are  then  further 
metabolized by phosphatase to produce the long carbon chain alcohol and inorganic phosphate similar to 
hexadecylphosphocholine. DPC is likely not excreted via the urine. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Nasal glucagon is a single-use product indicated as rescue treatment for severe hypoglycaemia. The drug 
product is composed of synthetic glucagon and the excipients β-CD, and DPC. Glucagon has long been 
recognized for its wide safety margin. The systemic toxicity of glucagon has been well characterized for 
the marketed injectable glucagon products.  Single-dose toxicity tests have not been conducted for NG, 
β-CD and DPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/602404/2019 
Page 21/116 
  
  
 
 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The  nasal  glucagon  toxicology  program  characterized  not  only  the  local  effects  of  this  glucagon  drug 
product but also the systemic effects following nasal administration after repeated administration. 
Since DPC is a novel excipient, a series of safety pharmacology, genetic toxicity, and reproduction studies 
were also conducted with this compound. 
The  toxicity  of  nasal  glucagon  (NG)  was  adequately  evaluated  in  rats,  dogs,  and  rabbits  in  a 
comprehensive battery of GLP compliant non-clinical studies at sufficient nasal surface area-based dose 
multiple and body weight-based dose multiple as compared to human. As mentioned in the above PK 
section, the Applicant is requested to further elaborate on exposure multiple by taking into account the 
systemic  exposure  data  measured  in  the  animal  species  as  compared  to  the  clinical  exposure  for  the 
recommended therapeutic dose of NG.    
The 28-day repeat-dose toxicity studies with nasal glucagon in rats and dogs were conducted by using the 
intranasal route of administration. These pivotal studies did not reveal any NG treatment-related adverse 
clinical signs and there was not systemic target organ toxicity at any dose tested in either species. The 
most important finding was a minimal to moderate degeneration of the olfactory epithelia (with/without 
subacute inflammation) in the nasal cavity in both animal species (0.2 mg/rat; 2 and 4 mg/dog) after 
daily IN dosing for 28 days. However, these lesions were reversible since they were no longer present 
following 14-day recovery.  
This nasal finding was attributable to glucagon as the - Placebo Control consisting of DPC + β-CD did not 
adversely  affect  the  nasal  cavity  and  appeared  cumulative  since  local  nasal  changes  were  limited  to 
minimal inflammation, but no atrophy/degeneration of the olfactory epithelia in dog given a single dose of 
NG as compared animals treated daily dose for 28 days.  
The  NOAEL  for  target  organ  toxicity  in  the  28-day  rat  and  dog  studies  was  0.2  mg/rat/day  and  4 
mg/dog/day, respectively 
Considering the important differences in nasal cavity anatomy between the animal species and humans, 
together with the mild and reversible local irritation observed in the rat and in the dog, such nasal finding 
is not considered to a relevant safety issue for the clinic. 
DPC given IN to dogs for 5 consecutive days at up to 10 mg/dog/day was well tolerated and did not cause 
any adverse clinical signs or gross pathological changes at necropsy. Histologically, minimal inflammation 
and mild accumulation of basophilic material was noted in the nasal cavity, but there was no evidence of 
atrophy/degeneration of the olfactory epithelia. 
The  excipients  β-CD  and DPC  were  also  assessed  as  part  of  placebo-control powder  in  the  28-day  IN 
toxicity studies and were both well tolerated in rats and dogs. Mild irritation was observed in dogs from the 
28-day repeat dose study for β-CD. For DPC, no local irritation in the nasal cavity of rats was observed, 
while mild irritation was noticed in dogs from the 28-day repeat-dose studies.  
The  following  specified  individual  degradation  non-genotoxic  impurities  were  assessed  in  14-day 
toxicology  qualification  studies 
in 
rats:  acetylated-glucagon,  desamido-glucagons,  oxidized 
methionine-glucagons [met(o)-glucagon], aspartimidyl (Asp 15)-glucagon, and Glucagon Isomer. No test 
item-related effects were noticed. Rats were exposed to greater cumulative doses of these impurities than 
patients with T1DM will receive, except for oxidized methionine-glucagon (0.914x). 
Genotoxicity 
Because nasal glucagon is a peptide, no genotoxicity studies were conducted with NG.

The  genotoxic  potential  of  DPC  was  assessed  in  the  bacterial  reverse  mutation  assay,  the  in  vitro 
mammalian  chromosome aberration  assay,  and  the  mammalian  erythrocyte micronucleus  assay.  DPC 
doses of up to 3 mg/kg/day IV did not affect fertility and early embryonic development in rats (NOAEL: 3 
mg/kg/day). In embryo-fetal development studies, no adverse fetal effects were seen with DPC at any 
dose level tested (up to 2.5 mg/kg/day IV in rats, up to 1 mg/kg/day IV in rabbits). DPC was determined 
to be not teratogenic in either species. 
Carcinogenicity 
Nasal glucagon is a single-use product indicated as rescue treatment for severe hypoglycemia. In view of 
the infrequent use no carcinogenicity studies were conducted in accordance with the ICH S1A guideline.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
Previous reproduction studies in rats and rabbits with glucagon (Glucagen) did not reveal any evidence of 
impaired fertility or embryo-fetal development. It was also shown not to cross the human placenta. As for 
β-CD, previous studies had revealed a transient neonatal growth retardation, but no permanent 
developmental defects had been found. Furthermore, there was no significant maternal toxicity. In view 
of the known safety profile of glucagon, no toxicity studies on reproduction were conducted with NG; that 
is acceptable.   
No adverse effects on male or female reproduction or early embryonic development through to the F2 
generation was noted in a pre- and post-natal study in rats at doses up to 1 mg/kg/day indicating DPC has 
no effect on F1 growth, behavior, and reproduction in rats. Compared to control animals, the duration of 
parturition was prolonged for F0 females at all the doses of DPC tested .The NOAEL for maternal toxicity, 
F1 growth, behavior, and reproduction was 1 mg/kg/day, which correspond to 3 multiple exposure based 
on AUC0-∞ of the therapeutic dose from 1 IV dose of DPC, and to 36 multiple exposure from 12 IV doses 
of DPC. The lack of correlative endpoints (no evidence of increased gestation length, no dystocia, and no 
decreased live birth index) indicates that the risk for prolongation of parturition due to DPC in pregnant 
patients with diabetes in the context of the intended clinical use of nasal glucagon is minimal. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetics of glucagon were evaluated in rats and dogs following daily IN administration of nasal 
glucagon for 28 days. Rats received at dose levels of 0.1 and 0.2 mg/day of glucagon as a solution into the 
nostrils of the rats. Dogs received daily doses of NG powder at dose levels of 2 and 4 mg/day of glucagon 
using the intended clinical single-use nasal dosing device.  
There were no sex differences in glucagon exposure. Accumulation of glucagon was not observed 
following daily IN administrations of nasal glucagon for 28 days. 
Local Tolerance  
From the data of local tolerance, a single ocular instillation with 30 mg NG was shown to be well tolerated 
in rabbits. This led to a minimal ocular irritation, which was limited to a slight erythema and a localized 
edema to the conjunctiva and palpebral membrane.  
Also, a single intratracheal insufflation of NG was well tolerated in rats.

In a distributional study of IN administered nasal glucagon together with a dye tracer in dogs, staining 
was present in the nasal passages, the nasopharynx, the stomach, the esophagus and the tongue, but 
there was no evidence of dye in the larynx or trachea indicating not distribution to the lung. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Nasal glucagon is a powder form of synthetic glucagon that is identical to the natural peptide. In line with 
the EMA guideline (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2) the applicant provided the following justification for 
not submitting ERA studies: 
“The synthetic polypeptide nasal glucagon is not expected to be released to the environment because 
polypeptides are not excreted intact from patients and are subject to extensive degradation in sewage 
treatment.  Nasal  glucagon  is  not  expected  to  be  persistent,  bioaccumulative  or  toxic.  Therefore, 
environmental studies were not conducted with nasal glucagon”.  
Nasal glucagon PEC surfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. NG is not expected to pose 
a risk to the environment.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Because the pharmacological properties of glucagon are well known, no primary pharmacology studies 
were conducted with NG in animal model of hypoglycaemia. The nonclinical pharmacology program was 
limited to the evaluation of glucose elevations after a single NG administration compared to subcutaneous 
(SC)  injection  of  recombinant  human  glucagon  in  fasted  beagle  dog.  In  view  of  the  comparable 
pharmacology it is agreed that no further PD studies are deemed necessary. However, it is to note that 
some  dogs  could  not  be  successfully  dosed  with  the  nasal  device  because  of  mechanical  problems; 
glucagon powder was administered in the nostril but obviously was not absorbed. The applicant explained 
that probably the powder was inadvertently sprayed directly against a small mucosa patch and did not 
reach larger mucosal areas the nasal cavity as intended. The anatomy of the canine nasal cavity (small 
vestibule  due  to  the  presence  of  ventral  and  dorstal  atrioturbinates)  favours  mechanical  problems  of 
administration. Considering the anatomical difference in human vs canine nasal cavity, it is unlikely that 
tight  obstruction  of  the  device  opening  occurs  in  humans.  Further  information  may  come  from 
post-marketing experience. 
No secondary PD studies were conducted with NG; that is also acceptable. 
The potential effects of nasal glucagon and its excipients on cardiovascular function were evaluated as 
part  of  the  28-day  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  in  dogs.  The  potential  for  DPC  to  affect  cardiovascular, 
respiratory, and central nervous system functioning was evaluated following a single IV (cardiovascular) 
and IN doses (CNS & respiratory). None of those studies raised concerns for alterations in cardiovascular, 
respiratory, or CNS function. At high doses of DPC increased BP, decreased HR, as well as shortening of 
QTc  interval  and  PQ  interval  prolongation  were  noted.  Though  no  specific  reason  for  the  small  but 
consistent changes in CV parameters in response to the excipient DPC could be provided, the changes 
were small and transient and therefore not considered a cause for concern. 
The PK and TK of glucagon have been appropriately evaluated after single-dose administration in dogs 
and repeat-dose administration of nasal glucagon by the IN route in rats and dogs. Concentrations of 
glucagon were determined by a validated RIA method. The pharmacokinetic PK profile of DPC was also 
appropriately determined in rats and dogs following IV and IN administration of DPC to support the DPC 
toxicology studies. The TK data demonstrate that there was rapid absorption and adequate exposure of 
glucagon observed in rats and dogs following IN administration for the toxicology studies. The DPC PK

data supplements the nasal glucagon toxicology studies indicating animals were systemically exposed to 
DPC following IV and IN administration of DPC in the Placebo Nasal Powder. 
In  agreement  with  regulatory  recommendations  and  ICH  M3(R2),  the  toxicology  program  for  nasal 
glucagon  (i.e.,  combination  of  synthetic  glucagon,  β-CD,  and  DPC)  included  28-day  repeated-dose 
toxicity studies in dog and rat, an intra-tracheal insufflation study in rats and an ocular tolerance study in 
rats. Intranasal administration of NG to rats and dogs for 28 consecutive days was well tolerated and 
there was no evidence of systemic target organ toxicity in rats or dogs after daily IN dosing with nasal 
glucagon  for  28  days.  The  NOAELs  were  0.2  mg  synthetic  glucagon/rat/day  and  4  mg  synthetic 
glucagon/dog/day  respectively,  corresponding  to  an  exposure  that  is  10x  and  68x,  respectively,  the 
human AUC following the planned 3-mg synthetic glucagon IN dose. In the repeat-dose toxicity studies 
only mild to moderate fully reversible histological changes to nasal mucosae was noted in both species. In 
addition, direct deposition into the lungs of rats did not result in adverse findings. Ocular instillation of NG 
was well tolerated. 
Since β-CD has been used as a GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) food additive and pharmaceutical 
excipient, no stand-alone toxicology studies were conducted with β-CD. However, β-CD was evaluated in 
the 28-day intranasal (IN) toxicity studies in rats and dogs as part of the Placebo Control Powder along 
with the third ingredient, the novel excipient DPC.   
For  DPC  that  is  a  novel  excipient,  a  series  of  safety  pharmacology,  genetic  toxicity,  and  reproduction 
studies, was conducted to evaluate the safety profile in accordance with recommendations from various 
regulatory  authorities  and  FDA’s  Nonclinical  Studies  For  The  Safety  Evaluation  Of  Pharmaceutical 
Excipients (FDA 2005). 
DPC given IN to dogs for 5 consecutive days at up to 10 mg/dog/day was well tolerated and did not cause 
any adverse effects. Histologically, there were minimal inflammation and mild accumulation of basophilic 
material but there was no evidence of atrophy/degeneration of the olfactory epithelia. 
When administered by the iv route DPC did not adversely affect male or female reproductive performance 
or early embryonic development of rats, embryo-fetal development of rats and rabbits, maternal (F0) 
growth and reproduction or offspring (F1) growth, behaviour, and reproduction.  
Compared to control animals, the duration of parturition was prolonged for F0 females at all the doses of 
DPC tested.  The NOAEL for maternal toxicity, F1 growth, behaviour, and reproduction was 1 mg/kg/day, 
which correspond to 3 multiple exposure based on AUC0-∞ of the therapeutic dose from 1 IV dose of DPC, 
and to 36 multiple exposure from 12 IV doses of DPC. The lack of correlative endpoints (no evidence of 
increased  gestation  length,  no  dystocia,  and  no  decreased  live  birth  index)  indicates  that  the  risk  for 
prolongation of parturition due to DPC in pregnant patients with diabetes in the context of the intended 
clinical use of nasal glucagon is minimal. 
In line with the regulatory guidelines, no carcinogenicity or phototoxicity are warranted. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
As glucagon is a well-known substance, an important aspect of the non-clinical programme is 
characterisation of the new excipient DPC which allows enhanced absorption through the nasal mucosa.  
Overall, the safety pharmacology and toxicity studies of the nasal glucagon program did not reveal 
adverse issues in animals associated with nasal glucagon or DPC. From a non-clinical point of view, the 
non-clinical package is supportive for the proposed marketing authorisation application of Baqsimi.

a Study IGBH was terminated early due to potential sub-target dosing and was repeated under a new trial 
alias, Study IGBG. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Over  the  course  of  the  clinical  development,  samples  were  analysed  for  glucagon  using  3  different 
methods:  initially an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to support studies IGBA and 
IGBD, next a radioimmunoassay (RIA) format for studies IGBG, IGBB, IGBC and IGBE; and finally a liquid 
chromatography  with  tandem  mass  spectrometry  (LC-MS/MS)  assay  for  study  IGBI.  These  assays 
measured  both  endogenous  and  exogenous  glucagon.  Although  the  commercial  RIA  kit  was  not  fully 
validated  according to  applicable  guidance,  comparable  results  for  IM  glucagon  within  all  PK  analyses 
indicate comparable results in relation to the GLP-compliant analysis.  
A routine GCP inspection of paediatric study IGBB was performed in December 2018 and January 2019. 
According  to  the  integrated  inspection  report  (GCP/2018/027),  dated  22/03/2019,  several  critical 
findings were detected in relation to source data and sample management, such as missing instruction on 
the creation of source data and incorrect handling of PK samples . Due to these findings, only the PD data 
from this paediatric study are considered reliable and acceptable to be used for MAA. The pivotal adult 
study  IGBC  was  conducted  in  parallel  to  the  inspected  trial.  Since  data  handling  was  similar,  the 
inspection team recommended to  consider only the PD data for MAA from the adult IGBC trial.  
The CHMP received on 12 April 2019 a letter from one of the investigator sites inspected as part of the 
routine  GCP  inspection  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  “third  party”)  in  which  a  number  of  concerns  were 
discussed with regards to the conclusions of the site inspection . This letter was considered during the 
assessment and had no impact on the outcome of the application. 
In  addition,  a  triggered  GCP  inspection  (INS/GCP/2019/008)  of  study  I8R-MC-IGBI  was  requested 
(inspection  adopted  by  the  CHMP  on  28  March  2019)  at  the  two  investigator  sites  in  Germany;  the 
conclusion  of  this  inspection  was  that  overall  trial  I8R-MC-IGBI  was  conducted  in  accordance  with 
international accepted standards and GCP requirements and that the reported data are valid and reliable. 
Absorption  
PK comparison between NG and injectable glucagon in adults 
The first two studies in men, studies IGBD and IGBA, compared the PK of different doses of NG (0.5, 1, 
2 and 3 mg) to 1 mg subcutaneous glucagon (SCG) in a cross-over way.  Study IGBD was conducted in 16 
healthy subjects and study IGBA in 18 patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). In study IGBD, no substantial 
levels of glucagon were detected in all subjects of the 0.5 mg NG dose group. For 7 subjects treated with 
1 mg NG and 15 subjects treated with 2 mg NG, serum glucagon concentrations increased from baseline.  
In study IGBA, no substantial levels of glucagon were detected in 7 out of 12 patients in the 1 mg NG dose 
group and in 4 out of 18 patients in the 2 mg NG group. After dosing with 3 mg NG (n = 8) or 1 mg SCG 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/602404/2019 
Page 27/116 
  
  
 
 
 
(n = 18) however, all patients had detectable levels of glucagon. It is important to note that the mean 
serum glucagon levels exclude patients with no detectable levels of glucagon post-dosing. Quantitative 
comparison of the results for 2 mg and 3 mg NG from study IGBA is hampered by the small number of 
subjects (3 mg) and the high LLOQ resulting in exclusion of “nonresponders” and a respective bias (2 mg). 
Across studies, the Cmax and the AUC0-t for the NG dose groups were lower than the Cmax and AUC0-t 
observed with 1 mg SCG (see figures), however, Tmax values were similar (15 to 20 minutes). In study 
IGBA, absorption appears to be delayed with nasal administration. 
Figure 2. Mean (+SD) glucagon concentration over time (left: IGBD, right: IGBA) 
The pivotal adult study  IGBC was a randomized, 2-way crossover study in 83 adult patients (77 with 
T1D,  6  with  T2D)  that  assessed  the  PK  and  PD  after  administration  of  3  mg  NG  compared  to  1  mg 
intramuscular glucagon (IMG) for the treatment of insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. A wash-out of at least 
7 days was inserted between drug administrations. Similar to studies IGBD and IGBA,  Cmax and the 
AUC0-t were lower in the NG group compared to the injectable glucagon, whereas median Tmax values 
were comparable (0.33h versus 0.25h). Absorption appears to be delayed with nasal administration . As 
stated above, PK data obtained in this study cannot be relied upon due to critical GCP findings.It is also to 
be noted that study IGBC was performed with the clinical trial drug product and, as shown below, different 
pharmacokinetic  behaviour  has  been  observed  in  comparison  with  the  commercial  drug  formulation 
(studies IGBI and IGBJ). However, as only the PD response is relevant for the desired action of Baqsimi, 
PK data are considered to be supportive to the B/R discussion. The high variability observed for the PK 
parameters throughout the different studies is considered to be of less relevance as this does not impact 
the efficacy and safety profile for Baqsimi.

Figure 3. Mean (+SD) glucagon concentration over time (IGBC) 
Study IGBI was designed as a clinical bridging and confirmatory study and assessed the efficacy, safety, 
PK, and PD of NG 3 mg (commercial drug product) in adult patients with T1DM. This study mimicked the 
design of study IGBC and aimed to compare indirectly clinical trial and commercial drug product.  
In total, 70 adult T1D patients received a single dose of 3 mg NG and 1 mg IMG in a cross-over way. 
AUC0-t was lower with the nasal route of administration, whereas median Tmax values were the same 
(0.25h).  The  Cmax  observed  in  study  IGBI  (7220  pg/ml)  was  higher  compared  to  study  IGBC  (3130 
pg/ml). Furthermore, the Cmax in study IGBI was higher relative to 1 mg IMG, which is contradictory to 
the results of study IGBC.  
Figure 4. Mean (+SD) glucagon concentration over time (IGBI) 
Study  IGBJ  is a Phase 3 study in Japanese adult patients, including patients ≥65 years, with type 1 
diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) and has a similar design as studies IGBC and IGBI. IGBJ was 
conducted to support registration of NG 3 mg as a treatment for severe hypoglycemia in Japan, and was 
ongoing at the time of the initial MAA. A total of 69 Japanese patients with T1DM (32 patients) or T2DM 
(37 patients), received a single dose of both treatments, 3 mg NG and 1 mg IMG, in a cross-over way. 
Very  high  Cmax  concentrations  (mean  of  11400  pg/ml)  were  obtained  with  3  mg  NG.  A  separate  PK 
analysis  of  the  12  patients  aged  between  65-74  years  was  performed  and  gave  no  evidence  for  a 
prominently deviating PK of NG in elderly patients.

Figure 5. Mean (+SD) glucagon concentration over time (IGBJ) 
PK comparison between NG and injectable glucagon in paediatrics 
One  pivotal  study  (IGBB)  was  conducted  to  compare  the  PK  and  PD  response  of  NG  with  IMG  in  a 
controlled clinical setting in paediatric patients. The study included 3 cohorts: 4 to <8, 8 to <12, and 12 
to <17 years of age. A washout of at least 7 days separated dosing occasions. During each study visit, 
fasted patients’ blood glucose was reduced to <80 mg/dL (<4.4 mmol/L) using insulin. Peak glucagon 
concentrations were in general higher in the IM-dosing groups, except for the 3 mg NG dosing group in the 
8- to <12-year-old.  
As stated above, PK data obtained in this study cannot be relied upon due to critical GCP findings. In 
addition and as already mentioned above, glucagon plasma concentrations were markedly lower in this 
study (and also in study IGBC) due to differences in drug product. In conclusion, PK data from study IGBB 
are not relevant for the final Baqsimi preparation. Therefore, there are no reliable NG PK data in the 
pediatric population at this stage. As shown by adult NG and IV PK data, wide differences in glucagon 
Cmax and AUC exist, however, the observed glucose response was essentially the same. Therefore, at 
doses achieving saturation of the glucose response, glucagon PK data per se are less important and 
should be considered as supportive information. 
Repeated administration of NG 
In study IGBG, two NG doses of 3 mg administered within a 15 minute interval or less than 1 minute apart 
were less than dose-proportional to a single 3 mg NG dose in terms of AUC and Cmax. Since a single 3 mg 
NG  dose  is  proposed  for  the  emergency  treatment  of  severe  hypoglycaemia  in  adult  and  paediatric 
diabetes patients, a lack of dose-proportionality is not an issue for this application.

Impact of nasal decongestion 
Study  IGBE  was  a  single-center,  open-label,  2-period,  parallel  study  that  assessed  the  impact  of  nasal 
decongestant (oxymetazoline) and common cold on 3 mg NG PK and PD in 36 otherwise healthy adults.  
Glucagon exposure of NG 3 mg + Common Cold’ was greater than that of the other 2 treatment groups, with 
numerically higher AUC(0-t) and Cmax. However, none of these differences reached statistical significance.

PK-results with NG are much more heterogeneous. This might only partly be explained by the small number of 
subjects (study IGBA) and the higher variability (% CV) observed with NG due to a variable degree of absorption 
through the nasal mucosa. PK results with 3 mg NG can be grouped in early studies, pivotal studies and studies 
with  the  commercial  formulation.  Lower  glucagon  exposure  mainly  appeared in  early  clinical  studies.  In  the 
pivotal studies IGBC and IGBB (12 to > 17 years) values for Cmax of ~ 3000 pg / ml and AUC of ~ 2000 pg * 
h / ml were found. The highest Cmax values were observed with the commercial formulation. In study IGBI, 
Cmax was doubled compared to study IGBC with Cmax of ~ 7000 pg / ml and AUC moderately increased to ~ 
3200 pg * h / ml. Even higher Cmax values (almost 4x Cmax of IGBC) were obtained in study IGBJ.

As a result of the markedly increased Cmax observed with the commercial formulation, administration of this 
formulation in young children (4 to 12 year old patients), who were tested in the pivotal paediatric study IGBB 
with  the  older  version  of  Baqsimi  powder  only,  may  lead  to  extraordinary  high  plasma  concentrations  for 
glucagon. Therefore, it was concluded that the risk associated with these findings renders the B/R of NG 3 mg 
in patients from 4 to 12 years negative. As requested, the applicant addressed potential safety concerns of high 
glucagon  plasma  levels  based  on  results  from  non-clinical  and  clinical  studies  and  based  on  mechanistic 
considerations.  The  applicant’s  view  is  agreed  that  none  of  the  analyses  performed  gave  a  hint  for  any 
unfavourable  effect  of  transiently  high  plasma  levels  of  glucagon.  Existing  data  indicate  that  3  mg  nasal 
glucagon fully occupies the glucagon receptors for a short period of time (see 3.3.2. PD) and that any excess 
glucagon  has  no  biological  effects  (maybe  except  for  GLP-1  receptor  stimulation;  it  may  cause  additional 
nausea).  Therefore,  although  it  is  expected  that  the  Cmax  in  children  will  exceed  the  level  needed  to 
compensate for variability and needed for rapid onset of action by far, the use of the adult dose in children is not 
expected to cause any harm and could therefore be accepted.  Due to the incorrect sample handling in studies 
IGBB and IGBC and also taken into account the markedly lower exposure towards glucagon noted in this study 
in comparison with the results from study IGBI and IGBJ, it is concluded that the PK data from studies IGBB and 
IGBC should not be taken into account for this MAA. This is acceptable as only the PD response is relevant for the 
desired action of Baqsimi and, as described above, the high concentrations would not negatively influence the 
safety of Baqsimi in the pediatric population. 
The Applicant was also asked to explore possible explanations for the drift of NG PK-values observed during the 
drug development program (early/pivotal/confirmatory studies), however, no convincing explanation could be 
provided. The issue is not further pursued.  
Furthermore, a comparison of the delay in administration of IM to the delay in absorption of NG was requested 
since in most studies a delay in absorption between intranasal and intramuscular glucagon was observed. With 
the submission of new data from study IGBJ, it seems that a delay in absorption is mainly observed with the 
older formulation, which is reflected in the time course of the PD response (delay of relevant blood glucose 
increase of max. 1,5 minutes with the commercial formulation compared to 4 min. with the older formulation, 
see 3.3.2 PD.) 
In conclusion, the issue of incorrect handling of the PK samples is not considered insurmountable as PK data are 
considered to be only supportive to the B/R discussion , but not critical for the current application. 
Determination and characterization of anti-drug antibodies  
Patient samples were analysed using a standard 4-tiered approach (see the figure below). All the clinical study 
samples  were  assessed  in  Tier  1  (screening)  for  possible  presence  of  ADA.  Samples  testing  positive  are 
subsequently confirmed (tier 2) and further titrated (tier 3) and tested for neutralizing capacity (tier 4).

Figure 7: Immunogenicity sample testing paradigm 
A treatment-emergent (TE) ADA-positive patient was defined as follows: If baseline result is ‘ADA Detected’, 
there  should  be  at  least  1  postbaseline  titer  that  is  a  4-fold  or  greater  increase  in  titer  from  baseline 
measurement  (treatment-boosted).  If  baseline  result  is  ‘ADA  Not  Detected’,  there  should  be  at  least  1 
post-baseline  ADA  ‘Detected’  sample  with  a  corresponding  titer  that  is  one  2-fold  dilution  higher  than  the 
minimum required dilution (treatment induced). However, for patients with baseline results ‘ADA not detected’, 
it is expected that putative ADA positive samples, further confirmed positive and showing a titer equal to the 
minimum required dilution (MRD) at one or several postbaseline time points are considered in the integrated 
analysis  of  the  clinical  significance  of  immunogenicity.  Further  discussion  was  therefore  provided  by  the 
Applicant with regard to four patients showing a temporal profile in ADA titer (see end of this section below and 
discussion on safety). 
A validated affinity capture elution (ACE) ligand-binding immunogenicity assay was used to screen, confirm, and 
titer ADA to NG in patient samples from clinical studies. The neutralizing potential was determined using a less 
sensitive validated cell based neutralizing ADA (NAb) assay that mimics the in vivo mechanism of action of NG.

During  sample  analysis  of  the  clinical  studies  IGBF,  IGBG,  and  B002,  the  three  studies  investigating  the 
immunogenicity potential of NG, putative positive rates (after Tier 1) were higher than predicted by validation 
studies  in  treatment-naïve  (baseline)  samples  (34.7%  vs.  18.8%);  however,  no  statistically  significant 
difference was observed between T1D and T2D nor between clinical studies. This difference most likely resulted 
from a pre-analytical difference between Locemia Solutions ULC (Locemia)-collected and Lilly-derived clinical 
trial samples. Therefore, it was concluded to establish an in-study cut point for the Tier 1 screening assay. Based 
on this consistent difference in baseline sample reactivity, it was decided to also re-evaluate the confirmatory 
(Tier 2), titration (Tier 3), and neutralizing (Tier 4) assay cut points specific for clinical samples collected during 
Locemia-run trials in a similar fashion. Cut points were updated and applied for sample analysis. The in silico 
sensitivity and in silico drug tolerance based on the updated cut points were redetermined. With regard to the 
antibody  assays,  further  clarifications  have  been  given  by  the  Applicant  to  support  the  use  of  the  in-study 
screening  cut  point  and  the  performance  of  the  low  positive  control  used  for  clinical  study  sample  analysis. 
Missing  validation  reports  and  bioanalytical  reports  were  provided.  No  long-term  stability  data  have  been 
provided by the Applicant. But the results of additional immunogenicity samples without long sample storage 
from the study IGBJ submitted with the responses to the D120 LoQ and being in line with previous results (i.e. 
showing a low ADA incidence) as well as the current literature bring further guarantee on the reliability of the 
previous  results.  No  unresolved  issues  are  remaining  regarding  the  methods  used  for  the  detection  of 
ADAs/Nabs. 
Distribution 
The apparent volume of distribution, based on observed glucagon concentrations (i.e. not baseline-corrected) 
was determined in study IGBI to be approximately 885 l (geometric mean) following a 3 mg NG administration. 
Elimination 
After nasal administration and absorption into the circulation, glucagon elimination is expected to be the same 
as that of injectable glucagon. With the injectable route of administration, studies have shown that glucagon 
degrades in the liver, kidney, and plasma. Urinary excretion of intact glucagon has not been measured. 
Half-life was short across studies. In study IGBI, the (geometric) mean half-life of glucagon was comparable 
after nasal and intramuscular administration with values of 0.625 h and 0.634h, respectively. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Study IGBG evaluated the effects on the PK and PD of repeating a NG 3 mg dose in adults with T1D or T2D. The 
study was designed as a single-center, randomized, 4-period, 4-sequence, open-label crossover study. 
Thirty-two patients were assigned to a sequence consisting of 4 NG treatments in different order, separated by 
a wash-out of at least 7 days. After an 8-hour overnight fast and 4 hours after the start of a low-carbohydrate 
breakfast, the following treatments were administered: 1) a single 3 mg dose; 2) two 3 mg doses, the second 
of which was administered in the same nostril 15 minutes after the first; 3) two 3 mg doses, the second of which 
was administered in the other nostril 15 minutes after the first; and 4) two 3 mg doses, the second of which was 
administered in the other nostril ≤1 minute after the first. Blood samples were collected to measure baseline 
glucagon and glucose levels at 30, 15, and ≤5 minutes (time 0) before dosing, and further samples were 
collected 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 150, and 180 minutes after the first dosing of each treatment.

While NG 6 mg (repeated 3 mg dose) resulted in significantly higher glucagon exposure than a single 3 mg dose, 
this was not dose-proportional: Cmax of NG 6 mg in all dose configurations (6650 to 8080 pg/mL) was less than 
2-fold the Cmax of a single 3 mg dose (4960 pg/mL). Tmax of NG 6 mg doses ranged from 0.33 to 0.50 hours 
compared with 0.17 hours for NG 3 mg. 
Among the double-dose treatment groups, Treatment 3 (two glucagon administrations in the opposite nostril 
within a 15- minute interval) was associated with slightly higher exposure. 
Figure 8. Mean (+ SD) glucagon over time by treatment group, change from baseline – Study IGBG. 
Table 1. Summary of PK parameters – study IGBG 
In summary, two NG doses of 3 mg administered within a 15 minute interval or less than 1 minute apart were 
less than dose-proportional to a single 3 mg NG dose in terms of AUC and Cmax. A lack of dose-proportionality 
was  also  observed  in  studies  IGBD  (1  and  2  mg  NG)  and  IGBA  (1,  2  and  3  mg  NG)  with  a  more  than 
dose-proportional increase in exposure between 1 and 2 mg and a similar exposure for the 2 and 3 mg NG dose 
levels.

Since a single 3 mg NG dose is proposed for the emergency treatment of severe hypoglycaemia in adult and 
paediatric diabetes patients, a lack of dose-proportionality is not an issue for this application. 
Special populations 
No individual studies of special populations (such as patients with renal or hepatic impairment) were conducted 
during the NG program, given the extensive previous clinical experience with glucagon and because NG is being 
developed as a rescue treatment for severe hypoglycemia. 
However, the NG clinical program evaluated the impact of age (pediatric and adult) on PK of nasal glucagon, and 
no impact was observed.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Common drug-drug interaction studies were not conducted. This is acceptable in view of the short half-life and 
the intended occasional use. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Glucagon increases blood glucose concentration by activating hepatic glucagon receptors, thereby stimulating 
glycogen breakdown and release of glucose from the liver. Hepatic stores of glycogen are necessary for glucagon 
to produce an anti-hypoglycaemic effect. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology program for NG consisted of 7 clinical studies providing PK and PD data, including the 
pivotal adult study I8R-MC-IGBC (IGBC), and the clinical bridging and confirmatory study I8R-MC-IGBI (IGBI) 
(Table 1).  As part of the responses to day 120 questions, the Applicant included the results of a new study in 
adult Japanese subjects (IGBJ), which was ongoing at the time of the initial MAA.

Though PK glucagon parameters with 2 mg NG was much smaller compared with SCG, the glucose response was 
similar  in  study  IGBD.  This  is  in  contrast to  study  IGBA  (n=9  for.  1  mg  NG,  n=8  for.  3  mg  NG).  Sustained

Mean (+SD) change in glucose concentration over time (IGBJ) 
PD data indicate that glucagon receptors are virtually fully occupied after 3 mg NG because the PD response was 
the same as with injected glucagon despite much lower plasma levels were reached with the latter.  
With the commercial product, the time course of blood glucose level is virtually superimposable for injected and 
nasal glucagon within around the first 40 min. Thereafter, blood glucose decreases somewhat faster with nasal 
than with injected glucagon, but this is not a concern. In particular, nearly no temporal delay of blood glucose 
increase (less than 2 min according to the figures) was observed. This is highly desirable but comes at the cost 
of high Cmax (see 3.3.1 PK). For comparison, lag was around 5 min in the older adult study IGBC and  the 
glucose  levels  were  lower;  the  same  is  true  for  children  aged  12  years  or  above  (Study  IGBB;  for  younger 
children the picture is less clear), see figures below.

Increase of glucagon plasma concentration by increasing NG dose from 3 mg to 6 mg has almost no 
consequence for glucose response.  
Study IGBE (Common Cold and Concomitant Administration of Nasal Decongestant on the PK and PD of NG in 
Otherwise Healthy Subjects) 
As it was the case for PK common cold and concomitant administration of nasal decongestant has limited impact 
on plasma glucose. As it was observed in study IGBD with healthy subjects, glucose returns speedily to baseline 
after Tmax / TBGmax.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Glucagon  is  a  single-chain  polypeptide  containing  29  amino  acid  residues  that  increases  blood  glucose 
concentration by activating hepatic glucagon receptors, thereby stimulating glycogen breakdown and release of 
glucose  from  the  liver.  The  synthetic  glucagon  peptide  used  in  Baqsimi  is  structurally  identical  to  naturally 
occurring human glucagon as well as the recombinant glucagon used in currently marketed glucagon emergency 
kits. This includes distribution and elimination pathways. No additional data are presented, which is considered 
appropriate.

Common  drug-drug  interaction  studies  were  not  conducted.  Potential  risks  of  drug  interactions  with  beta 
blockers,  indomethacin,  and  warfarin  are  proposed  for  labelling  based  on  precedent  set  by  other  marketed 
glucagon products for the treatment of severe hypoglycaemia. Furthermore, the short half-life of glucagon, in 
addition to its intended use as an occasional, single-dose treatment, lessens the risk of interaction with other 
drugs. 
PK and PD characterisation was performed in 7 clinical studies, including the pivotal paediatric study IGBB, the 
pivotal adult study IGBC, and the clinical bridging and confirmatory study IGBI.  As part of the responses to day 
120 questions, results of a new Japanese study (IGBJ), which was ongoing at the time of the initial MAA, were 
included. Study IGBI and IGBJ are the only studies in which the final commercial formulation was administered.  
PK and PD are closely related in non-diabetic subjects. In T1D patients blood glucose level increase is sustained 
after Tmax even though plasma glucagon concentration has returned almost to normal. However, this is expected 
without counteracting insulin secretion.  
A delay in absorption between intranasal and intramuscular glucagon is observed in most studies using the older 
Baqsimi formulation, which is reflected in a delay in blood glucose increase. However, nearly no temporal delay 
of blood glucose increase is observed with the commercial formulation in studies IGBI and IGBJ. 
PK/PD results with 1 mg SCG or IMG are consistent and the only deviations (increased PK-values in study IGBB 
and reduced glucose increase in study IGBD) are easily explained by the study design (children with lower body 
weight and healthy normoglycaemic subjects, respectively).  
Contrarily, PK-results with NG are much more heterogeneous and an inexplicable drift of PK-values is observed 
during the development program. Lower glucagon exposure mainly appeared in early clinical studies (IGBA, 
IGBE). In contract, Cmax increased markedly with the commercial formulation (IGBI and IGBJ) compared to the 
older  formulation  used  in  the  pivotal  studies  IGBC  (adult)  and  IGBB  (paediatric).  Based  on  the  important 
increase in Cmax observed with the commercial formulation, extraordinary high plasma concentrations may 
appear  in  young  children  when  receiving  the  adult  dose  of  the  commercial  formulation.  As  requested,  the 
Applicant assessed potential safety concerns of high glucagon plasma levels, but none of the analyses performed 
gave  a  hint  for  any  unfavourable  effect  of  transiently  high  plasma  levels  of  glucagon.  This  is  agreed  and 
therefore the use of the adult dose also for young children is accepted.  
It is concluded that, due to considerable PK differences for the commercial vs. the older product in combination 
with critical GCP findings in study IGBB, PK data from studies IGBB and IGBC are unreliable. However, as at 
doses achieving saturation of the glucose response, glucagon PK data are not pivotal.  
Consistent  PD  data  were  demonstrated  across  adult  confirmatory  trials  using  clinical  trial  drug  product  and 
commercially representative drug product, and supported the clinical comparability between them.

Regarding non-GCP-compliant data handling and storage, the applicant pointed out (in their response to the 
inspection report) that for a rather large fraction of visits the obtained data were recorded independently, i.e. 
they were not only entered in the non-GCP-compliant eCRFs but were also kept at the individual study sites 
according to local procedures. This enables re-evaluation of the study results using only patients for which ≥90% 
of data could be verified. This re-evaluation was performed in response to major objections raised by the CHMP.  
Assessment of the response concluded  that the re-analyses based on source documentation available in Study 
IGBB demonstrate a benefit/ risk profile consistent with the one determined based on the complete dataset. The 
MO  pertaining  to  GCP  non-compliance  of  the  data  recording  system  is  considered    addressed  through  the 
availability  of  independent  recordings  of  eCFR  data  at  the  individual  study  sites.  The  results  of  the  newly 
performed analysis taking these data detected at the individual study sites into account (including patients for 
whom >90% of source data were available) are in agreement with the previous analysis including the entire 
patient population. 
Albeit study IGBC has not been inspected, the problem of missing instruction on the creation of source data 
likewise applies to this study. Unlike for study IGBB, re-evaluation of study IGBC based on patients/ visits with 
high percentage of verified data was not considered meaningful because only around 25% of visits could be 
included in this re-analysis. 
Hence, evidence of PD in adults has to be derived from study IGBI, which mimicked the design of study IGBC and 
was  conducted  with  the  commercial  drug  formulation.  The  latter  study  has  been  subject  to  GCP  inspection 
(INS/GCP/2019/008) and no critical findings were identified in this inspection. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The synthetic glucagon peptide used in Baqsimi is structurally identical to naturally occurring human glucagon 
as well as the recombinant glucagon used in currently marketed glucagon emergency kits. This allows transfer 
of many data available from IM glucagon. It has been shown that PK results obtained with the clinical trial drug 
product were markedly lower than those resulting from the studies with the commercially representative NG 
drug product. Furthermore, due to critical GCP findings in study IGBB, the reliability of PK data from this study 
was  questioned.  However,  due  to  the  specific  characteristics  of  glucagon,  the  PK  data  are  considered  only 
supportive to the B/R discussion.  
A re-evaluation of study IGBB was performed, and the conclusion is that the results are in agreement with the 
previous analysis. 
Unlike for study IGBB, re-evaluation of study IGBC based on patients/ visits with high percentage of verified data 
was not considered meaningful because only around 25% of visits could be included in this re-analysis. 
Hence, evidence of PD, efficacy and safety in adults has to be derived from study IGBI, which mimicked the 
design of study IGBC and was conducted with the commercial drug formulation. This study has been subject to 
GCP inspection (INS/GCP/2019/008) and no critical findings were identified in this inspection. 
Consistent PD data were demonstrated across adult confirmatory trials using clinical trial drug product and 
commercially representative drug product, and supported the clinical comparability between them.

Treatments 
The study consisted of two outpatient visits each lasting about 6 hours. Induced hypoglycaemia was followed by 
treatment with either IN or IM glucagon. Prior to dosing on the first visit, the order of treatments for the two 
visits was randomly assigned. A minimum of 7 days, and a maximum of 28 days was required between Visit 1 
and Visit 2. 
Patients randomized to Cohort A received the study drugs in the following sequence: 
Visit 1: IV insulin followed by IN glucagon (Test product; AMG504-1) 
Visit 2: IV insulin followed by IM glucagon (Reference product; GlucaGen®)

Patients randomized to Cohort B received the study drugs in the following sequence: 
Visit 1: IV insulin followed by IM glucagon (Reference product; GlucaGen®) 
Visit 2: IV insulin followed by IN glucagon (Test product; AMG504-1) 
A description of the mode of administration, dose, and dosage schedule of the study medications administered 
is provided below in Table 8. 
Table 3 Study Medication Administration, Dose and Dosage Schedule 
Treatment 1 (reference product): GlucaGen® HypoKit 1 mg, powder and solvent for solution for injection 
(solution of 1 mg/mL glucagon administered in the deltoid muscle of the patient’s non-dominant arm) 
Treatment 2 (test product): AMG504-1 30 mg dry-mist nasal glucagon powder (30 mg of AMG504-1 contains 3 
mg of glucagon administered in the nostril) 
Objectives 
The primary objective of AMG106 was to assess the efficacy and safety of 3 mg glucagon administered 
intranasally in comparison with commercially-available IM glucagon in reversing insulin-induced hypoglycemia 
in patients with T1D or T2D. In addition, the PK and PD parameters of IN and IM glucagon were evaluated.

Outcomes/endpoints 
A responder was defined as a subject who achieved either an increase in blood glucose to ≥ 70 mg/dL (3.9 
mmol/L) or an increase of ≥20 mg/dL from nadir within 30 minutes after receiving study glucagon, without 
receiving additional actions to increase the blood glucose level. Glucose levels were measured from t=0 and, and 
from glucose “nadir”, defined as the minimum glucose measurement at the time of, or within 10 minutes 
following glucagon administration. 
Sample size 
The sample size estimate for the study was based on the primary outcome of achieving either an increase in 
blood glucose to ≥70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) or an increase of ≥20 mg/dL from nadir within 30 minutes after 
receiving study glucagon without receiving additional interventions to increase the blood glucose level across 
varying amounts of correlation within participant (to account for the cross-over design). 
Table 9 below provides the number of subjects required in the study in order to assess the non-inferiority of 
intranasal glucagon treatment and intramuscular glucagon treatment among subjects with T1D using the 
following assumptions: 
• 80% power 
• A response rate of 95% for both treatments 
• A non-inferiority limit of 10 percentage points (absolute value) 
• One-sided alpha level of 0.025 
• Correlation of zero 
Table 4 Sample Size Estimates for Non-Inferiority Limits, Levels of Power, and Amounts of 
Correlation 
Given the above assumptions, the sample size required was 75 participants with T1D. An additional 7 
participants with T2D were also to be enrolled and an exploratory analysis was performed on the total population 
(T1D and T2D; N=82). 
No adjustment in sample size was made for potential loss to follow-up because participants that were lost to 
follow-up or drop-out were replaced. The sample size indicated in the cells denotes the number of participants 
completing the study. 
The following considerations were taken into account to justify the choice of the target achievement in the two 
groups as well as the choice of acceptable non-inferiority limit: 
Response Rate 
Injection group

The assumed response rate of 95% for glucagon by injection reflects that glucagon is not always effective under 
real-world use. In Locemia Solution ULC’s recently completed phase II study (AMG102), one participant out of 
18 (5.6%) treated with glucagon by injection required 30 minutes to achieve a BG increase of 20 mg/dL and in 
excess of 30 minutes to achieve a BG > 68 mg/dL (3.8 mmol/L). 
AMG504-1 group 
In the same phase II study, treatment with 2 mg intranasally was 93% effective while 3 mg was 100% effective 
in causing patients to return to a BG > 68 mg/dL (3.8 mmol/L) by 30 minutes. As AMG504-1 has not been used 
in the setting of the lower BG levels targeted in this phase III clinical study (i.e., 45-50 mg/dL), a slightly lower 
percent efficacy of 95% has been projected. 
Importantly, even if either treatment failed to meet the narrow definition of the primary endpoint of an increase 
in glucose level to ≥70 mg/dL within 30 minutes in every patient, the primary clinical outcome of an increase in 
BG of ≥20 mg/dL was satisfactory from a clinical perspective because sufficient recovery from clinical signs of 
hypoglycemia occurred at levels below 70 mg/dL which, in turn, permitted the patient to consume carbohydrate 
and fully recover. 
Non-inferiority Margin 
The proposed non-inferiority margin of 10 percentage points has been chosen based on the limited data 
available for glucagon injection (Harris et al. simulated emergency study), the considerable data for an 
analogous product (EpiPen for treatment of anaphylaxis) and considerations of actual use in an emergency. 
Injectable Glucagon 
We are not aware of published data documenting patient/caregiver treatment success rates in actual clinical 
situations wherein the currently injected glucagon must be given to treat an episode of severe hypoglycemia. 
However, one study has been published in which parents of children and adolescents with T1D used a currently 
available glucagon kit in a simulated emergency situation. Parents were asked to pretend it was 3:00 am and 
their child was unconscious. They were then given an unopened emergency glucagon kit (GlucaGen® HypoKit, 
Novo Nordisk®) and asked to administer the medication into a wrapped piece of meat to simulate a thigh. In this 
study, 69% of the parents experienced difficulties with the product and 10% completely failed to deliver the 
medication. 
Randomisation 
The Investigational Products were to be administered only to patients included in the study following the 
procedures set out in the clinical study protocol. 
Patients were assigned a unique participant identification number upon study enrollment. Each patient retained 
this number throughout the study. The order of Investigational Product administration was sequentially 
assigned from a compute-generated randomization list revealed to clinic center staff using a central study 
website upon enrollment of each participant. The randomization followed a 1:1 allocation ratio of treatment 
received at first study dosing visit using a blocks of N=2 and stratified by clinic site. 
Patients who were discontinued from the study after dosing were to retain their patient number and their 
randomization number.

Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label, unblinded study. 
Statistical methods 
The primary analysis was a treatment group comparison of the primary outcome in the T1D cohort (Primary 
Analysis Cohort). 
The proportion of successes in each treatment arm and the difference in proportions was computed. A one-sided 
97.5% confidence interval was obtained from the 1-sample mean of the paired differences in outcome 
(1=outcome observed; 0=outcome not observed) across visits. Non-inferiority of intranasal glucagon was 
declared if the upper limit of the one-sided 97.5% confidence interval constructed on the difference in 
proportions (intramuscular glucagon – intranasal glucagon), was less than the non-inferiority limit of 10%. The 
confidence interval of the difference in proportions was calculated using methods to account for the correlation 
due to the cross-over design. 
The primary efficacy analysis included all participants who complete the two dosing visits with the following 
exceptions: 
• Dosing visits in which a glucose-elevating intervention (e.g., oral carbohydrates or IV glucose) was given 
either before receipt of study glucagon or within the first 10 minutes after glucagon administration were 
considered to be aborted dosing visits and not included in the analysis. These visits were either repeated or the 
participant was replaced with another participant. 
• Participants with one or both dosing visits in which the central lab nadir glucose value was ≥70 mg/dL were not 
included in the efficacy analyses. Information from these visits was used only in the safety analysis. 
The primary analysis also was repeated separately in subsets of participants based on the following: 
 Nadir <60 mg/dL on both Study Visits 
 Nadir <50 mg/dL on both Study Visits 
 Nadir within 5 mg/dL on both Study Visits 
 Complete central lab glucose values preceding and including the 30 minute measurement (i.e. non-missing 
central lab glucose at time 0, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes, 25 minutes, and 30 minutes). 
The primary analysis was repeated using the outcome of an increase in blood glucose level to 70 mg/dL or more. 
For this analysis, a rise in blood glucose level by 20 mg/dL or more that does not reach 70 mg/dL within 30 
minutes would not be considered a success. 
A Kaplan-Meier curve for each treatment group was constructed for the time to occurrence of central lab blood 
glucose ≥70 mg/dL or an increase of ≥20 mg/dL from nadir after receiving study glucagon (outcome). A separate 
Kaplan-Meier curve for each treatment group was constructed for the time to occurrence of an increase in 
central lab blood glucose of ≥20 mg/dL from nadir after receiving study glucagon.

A treatment group comparison of the time from treatment to outcome was also performed using the marginal 
Cox proportional hazard models for clustered data (to account for the correlation due to the crossover design), 
adjusted for central lab nadir blood glucose and treatment period. Due to the discrete time data (5, 10, or 30 
minute intervals), the exact method was used. This method averages the Cox proportional hazards likelihood 
over all possible orderings of tied event times. 
The proportional hazards assumption was assessed using a Kolmogorov-supremum test. As the proportional 
hazards assumption held for the adjustment factors (nadir blood glucose, treatment period) and for the 
treatment group variable, neither the stratified Cox proportional hazards model, nor, the extended Cox 
proportional hazards model (with time-dependent covariate) was used. 
The analysis was repeated in the subgroup of observations with central lab nadir blood glucose value <50 
mg/dL. 
If a participant received additional intervention treatment to raise blood glucose prior to achieving a blood 
glucose value that was ≥70 mg/dL or an increase of ≥20 mg/dL from nadir, the remaining time points were 
considered non-events (i.e. blood glucose was not ≥70 mg/dL and did not increase ≥20 mg/dL from nadir). 
A treatment comparison of blood glucose over the 90 minutes following administration of glucagon was 
completed using a linear mixed model with repeated measures that accounts for the correlation due to the 
cross-over design and the correlation due to multiple measures, adjusting for starting glucose level and time 
period. Least-square means were calculated for blood glucose in each treatment group and the difference in 
blood glucose between treatment groups (IM – IN). Residuals from the model were assessed numerically and 
graphically to ensure an approximately normal distribution. As the distribution did not appear skewed, and no 
influential outliers were discovered, a transformation was not attempted. 
If a participant received additional intervention to raise blood glucose, measurements taken after the time of 
intervention were excluded from the analysis. 
Hypoglycemia symptoms were assessed using the Edinburgh Hypoglycemia Scale. Responses to each symptom 
on the Edinburgh Hypoglycemia Scale questionnaire were tabulated per instructions on the questionnaire at 
each time point for both treatment groups. The total score on the questionnaire were computed at each time 
point for both treatment groups as the sum of the scores for each symptom. 
The total score was compared between treatment groups through a linear mixed model with repeated measures 
accounting for the correlation due to the cross-over design (same participant received both treatments) and the 
correlation due to multiple measures of the questionnaire (questionnaire administered multiple times during 
testing). The starting score and treatment period were included as covariates in the model.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
Two protocol versions were drafted: AMG106 dated 18-Jul-2013 and v2.0 dated 27-Sep-2013. 
No other changes were made to the protocol. 
Protocol compliance 
A total of 131 protocol violations were reported 
All protocol deviations reported in the study were deemed to have no impact on the assessment of the study 
objectives.  
Baseline data 
Table 11 presents the demographic and baseline characteristics of the Safety Cohort, by diabetes type. Of the 
patients included in the Safety Cohort (n=83), the mean (SD) age of participants was lower for T1D patients 
compared to the T2D patients [32.9 (12.3) years vs. 47.8 (14.7) years]. The majority of patients in both groups 
were female (58% T1D, 67% T2D), with the mean (SD) age of disease duration comparable between T1D and 
T2D patients [18.1(11.2) vs. 18.8 (7.8) years, respectively). The majority of patients with T1D reported the use 
of an insulin pump as their primary modality (n=57, 74.0%), compared to only 17% of T2D patients. T1D 
patients, also reported lower median total daily insulin (TDI) compared to T2D patients (0.58 units/kg, range: 
0.46 to 0.68 units/kg vs.0.81 units/kg, range: 0.57 to1.22 units/kg).

Table 6 Glucose Nadir Values in the Primary Analysis Population (Patients with T1D) in Study IGBC 
Numbers analysed 
Of the 88 patients who completed the Enrollment Visit, 83 (77 T1D, 6 T2D) patients received at least one dose 
of the study drug, and were included in the safety analysis (Safety Cohort). Of these, 3 patients (2 patients with 
T1D and 1 patient with T2D) were excluded from all further analyses. 
The primary analysis, a treatment group comparison of the proportion of patients achieving treatment success, 
was performed in the T1D patient cohort only (n=75). The primary analysis was repeated to include patients 
with T2D (Combined Primary Analysis Cohort; n=80). A per protocol analysis was also performed in the T1D 
population (n=63), which included only inwindow central lab blood glucose values, removed observations where 
insulin was stopped prior to central lab blood glucose reaching ≤60 mg/dL, and removed observations without an 
in-window central lab blood glucose value at the 30 minute time point. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The primary efficacy analysis was a treatment group comparison of the primary outcome in Primary Analysis 
cohort, composed of all T1D patients having completed both Study/Dosing Visits with eligible glucose and 
glucagon levels. The primary efficacy outcome, treatment success, was defined as either an increase in blood 
glucose to ≥70 mg/dL or an increase of ≥20 mg/dL from glucose nadir within 30 minutes after receiving study 
glucagon, without receiving additional actions to increase the blood glucose level. Due to the residual activity of 
circulating insulin, glucose nadir was defined as the minimum glucose measurement at the time of, or within 10 
minutes following glucagon administration. 
Based on these definitions, as shown in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/602404/2019 
Page 55/116 
 
 
 
   
  
 
 
Table 13, the proportion of IN- and IM-dosed patients who achieved treatment success was 0.987 (n=74) and 
1.0 (n=75), respectively. Within the population of patients achieving treatment success, and broken down by 
treatment success parameters, 100% of all patients reported an increase in blood glucose ≥ 20 mg/dL from 
glucose nadir within 30 minutes of glucagon dosing, and 97% (n=72) of IN-dosed patients and 99% (n=74) of 
IM-dosed patients reported an increase of ≥70 mg/dL from glucose nadir within 30 minutes of glucagon dosing. 
The unadjusted and adjusted differences, and their 1-sided upper 97.5% confidence limits, for the proportion of 
patients achieving treatment success between the IM and IN treatment groups was 0.013 (0.040) and 0.015 
(0.043), respectively.

Treatments 
The study consisted of one or two outpatient visits each lasting about 4 hours. When target glucose of <80 
mg/dL was reached, treatment with either IN or IM glucagon followed. Prior to dosing on the first visit, 
determination of the study visit schedule was randomly assigned: Patients in the 4-<12 year old age group were 
randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 2 outpatient visits receiving different doses of IN glucagon during each, or to 1 
outpatient visit receiving IM glucagon. For 4-<12 year olds randomized to receive two doses of IN glucagon, and 
for 12- <17 year olds, a minimum of 7, and a maximum of 28 days was required between Visit 1 and Visit 2. 
Patients 4-<12 years old randomized to Cohort 1 received the Investigational Product in the following sequence: 
Visit 1: Intravenous insulin/ insulin pump, (if needed) followed by IM glucagon (Reference product; GlucaGen® 
HypoKit (Novo Nordisk®)

Objectives 
Primary objective 
The primary objective of AMG103 was to assess, in a pediatric population of TID patients, the PK and 
pharmacodynamics (PD) of glucagon administered intranasally in comparison with commercially-available 
intramuscular (IM) glucagon. 
Secondary objective 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/602404/2019 
Page 59/116 
 
 
 
   
  
 
The secondary objective of AMG103 was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IN glucagon in a pediatric 
population of TID patients. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy variables for the study are the PK and PD parameters calculated using both the raw and 
adjusted concentrations of glucagon and glucose, respectively.  
In each study period, blood samples were collected by catheter for the determination of plasma glucagon (4 mL 
each in K2 EDTA purple top Vacutainers containing 250KIU Aprotinin per mL of blood) and plasma glucose levels 
(each blood tube were gently inverted 8-10 times immediately after collection to ensure adequate mixing with 
the anticoagulant. The tubes were then placed on wet/crushed ice for up to 30 minutes without exceeding 30 
minutes prior to centrifugation) as follows : 
• Glucose: For all participants, plasma glucose levels were measured using a bedside rapid glucose analyzer 
(Analox, YSI or equivalent). During the insulin infusion, glucose levels were measured no more than 10 minutes 
apart while the plasma glucose level was >100 mg/dL and no more than 5 minutes apart when the plasma 
glucose level was <100 mg/dL; 
• Glucose and glucagon: Once a plasma glucose level of <80 mg/dL was reached, the basal rate returned to 
normal for participants using an insulin pump and the insulin infusion stopped for participants using insulin 
injections, a blood sample was collected for pharmacokinetics (glucagon) and pharmacodynamics 
(glucose)within 5 minutes before glucagon administration (i.e. 0 hour), and; 
• Glucose and glucagon: Plasma glucose levels were measured using a YSI (or equivalent device) for safety and 
serial blood sampling were performed for pharmacokinetics (glucagon) and pharmacodynamics (glucose) 
assessments 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 60 and 90 minutes following glucagon administration. 
Sample size 
Due to the lack of available data on children, a sample size of 48 participants was selected as a convenience 
sample based on the FDA guidance for pediatric PK studies which indicates that the standard approach is to 
administer either single or multiple doses of a drug to a relatively small (e.g., 6-12) group of participants. 
A total of 49 participants between the ages of 4 and <12 years (18 participants 4 to <8 years and 18 participants 
8 to <12 years) and 13 participants between the ages of 12 and <17 years, were enrolled. One patient in the 12 
and <17 years was not randomized due contraindicated concomitant drug use. All participants in the older age 
group of 12 - <17 years old received the 3.0 mg dose of intranasal glucagon and the IM glucagon, with the order 
of treatments randomly assigned prior to dosing; participants in the two (2) younger age groups of 4 - <8 and 
8 - <12 years of age, were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either: 1) 2 Study Visits: one to receive the 2.0 mg dose 
of IN glucagon, and the other to receive the 3.0 mg dose of IN glucagon; 2) 1 Study Visit to receive IM glucagon. 
Randomisation 
The Investigational Products were to be administered only to patients included in the study following the 
procedures set out in the clinical study protocol. 
Patients were assigned a unique participant identification number upon obtaining consent. Each patient retained 
this number throughout the study. For patients 4-<12 years old, treatment group (3 mg intranasal at first 
dosing visit/2 mg intranasal at second dosing visit; 2 mg intranasal at first dosing visit/3 mg intranasal at second 
dosing visit; intramuscular at first and only dosing visit) was sequentially assigned from a computer-generated 
randomization list revealed to clinic center staff using a central study website upon enrollment of each

participant. The randomization followed a 1:1:1 allocation ratio using blocks of N=3. The randomization list was 
stratified by age group (4-<8 years old and 8-<12 years old). 
For patients 12-<17 years old, the treatment order (intramuscular at first dosing visit/3 mg intranasal at second 
dosing visit vs. 3 mg intranasal at first dosing visit and intramuscular at second dosing visit) was sequentially 
assigned from a computer-generated randomization list revealed to clinic center staff using a central study 
website. The randomization followed a 1:1 allocation ratio using blocks of N=2. 
Patients who were discontinued from the study after dosing were to retain their patient number and their 
randomization number. 
Blinding (masking) 
The randomization code list was not made available to the personnel in charge of the administration of glucagon 
until the morning of the first Dosing Visit. For those assigned to 2 visits with IN glucagon, the order of the dose 
of intranasal glucagon (2.0 mg or 3.0 mg) was randomly assigned and blinded throughout the study. 
For patients in Cohort 2, patients, investigator staff, persons performing the assessments, and data analysts 
remained blinded to the identity of the treatment from the time of randomization until database lock, using the 
following methods: (1) randomization data were kept strictly confidential until the time of unblinding, and were 
not accessible by anyone else involved in the study (2) the identity of the treatments was concealed by the use 
of study drugs that were identical in packaging, labeling, schedule of administration, appearance, taste and 
odor. 
Unblinding was only permitted in the case of patient emergencies and at the conclusion of the study. 
Statistical methods 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of glucagon were derived NCA based on raw concentrations (AUC0-t, AUC0-
∞, CL/F, Cmax, λz, t1/2 and tmax) and baseline-adjusted concentrations (AUC0-t, Cmax and tmax).  
Given the blood volume limitations, especially for smaller children, the baseline glucagon concentration was 
obtained from the sample obtained prior to dosing. Individual concentrations and PK parameters of glucagon 
were summarized with descriptive statistics by treatment group. 
The PD analysis of glucose was performed using SAS 9.4, and PD parameters were calculated by NCA.  Key PD 
parameters were derived to assess the exposure to glucose and duration of exposure above, below and within 
the normal glucose range. The normal range for glucose was considered to be 70 to 108 mg/dL (3.9 to 6.0 
mmol/L). Actual sampling times were used for all calculations, AUECWithin, TAbove, TBelow, TWithin, 
DurationAbove, DurationBelow and DurationWithin) and baseline-adjusted concentrations (AUEC0-1.5, Cmax, 
and t max). 
Baseline glucose concentrations were calculated as the mean of concentrations from samples obtained when the 
insulin infusion was stopped and immediately prior to dosing (i.e., times - 0.08 and 0.00 hours). 
Exploratory analyses were performed to evaluate exposure-response relationship, a fundamental component for 
the understanding of drug effect and supporting efficacy endpoints. The relationship between the exposure 
(concentrations and parameters) of glucagon and glucose was explored using graphical displays and numerically 
using correlation analysis. More specifically, scatterplots showing the relationship between (i) plasma glucagon 
and plasma glucose levels, (ii) baseline-adjusted PK parameters and baseline-adjusted PD parameters were 
generated.

The primary analysis (pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics) included all participants who provide evaluable 
data for at least one of the treatments. Concentration data of the remaining participants is presented separately. 
The analysis was be stratified by age cohort (4-<8, 8-<12, and 12-<17 years old), except where otherwise 
indicated. The analyses for the 4-<8 and 8-<12 years old cohorts may have been pooled if the data suggests 
homogeneity of effect. 
The 2mg and 3mg intranasal glucagon treatment arms may have been pooled if the data suggests homogeneity 
of effect. 
The central lab glucose and glucagon measurements were used for analysis. If a central lab glucose 
measurement was missing, then the YSI (or equivalent) measurement from that time point was used. 
•  Nadir glucose was defined as the minimum glucose measurement at the time of or within 10 minutes 
following glucagon administration. 
•  Blood draws taken for quality control assessment (QC samples) were not included in the primary or 
exploratory analysis, apart from the designated quality control analysis 
•  Missing glucose measurements (i.e. no central lab or site measurement available) were imputed using 
Rubin’s* method based on available lab glucose measurements. 
• 
For exploratory analysis, out-of-window blood draws (blood draws taken before/after the midpoint 
between consecutive planned measurements) were included. Due to the exploratory nature of the 
analyses, both 95% and 99% confidence intervals were calculated, except where otherwise indicated. 
*Rubin’s method for imputation is a statistical technique used to estimate each missing data value based on the 
lab glucose measurements that are available at other time points. Multiple plausible values are imputed for each 
missing data value to quantify the increased statistical margin of error due to the missing data. 
Results  
Participant flow  
A total of 49 T1D pediatric patients were screened at the enrollment visit, 18 of which were in the 4-<8 years old 
age category and 8-<12 years old age category, each, and 13 of which were in the 12-<17 years old age 
category. Of the 49 patients screened, 1 patient in the 8-<12 years old age category requested withdrawal prior 
to receiving the second dose of Study Drug (Dosing Visit 1: 3mg IN; Dosing Visit 2: 2mg IN), and 1 patient in the 
12-<17 years old age category was excluded from the study due to regular use of a prohibited concomitant 
medication. A total of 48 patients therefore received one (1) dose of the Study Drug, with 47 of the 48 patients 
completing the requirements of their Study Arm. In addition, one patient in the 12-<17 year old group had a 
repeat 3mg IN Dosing Visit due to insufficient  administration of glucagon (device malfunction during the initial 
Dosing Visit - the design defect that led to the device malfunction was corrected to prevent future malfunction). 
As a result, 11 patients were dosed with 2mg IN glucagon, and 18 patients each, were dosed with 3mg IN 
glucagon and IM glucagon across a total of 84 Dosing Visits (23 2mg IN Dosing Visits, 37 3mg IN Dosing Visits- 
1 patient dosed twice, and 24 IM glucagon Dosing Visits.

Protocol amendments 
AMG103 Protocol v1.0 (dated the 23rd of July, 2013) was amended on the 15th of October, 2013 (Protocol 
Amendment #1). Due to the FDA’s request that both doses of AMG504-1 (2mg and 3mg formulations) be 
evaluated in participants aged 4-<12 years of age, Protocol Amendment #1 dictated that the total number of 
study participants increase from 40, to 48 participants (12 participants required in the 12-<17 year old age 
cohort, and 18 participants, each, required in the 4-<8 and 8-<12 year old age cohorts).

AMG103 Protocol v2.0 (dated 15th of October 2013 was amended on the 18th of June, 2014 (Protocol 
Amendment #2). The minimum weight requirement was removed from the protocol (enacted in v3.0 dated 
18-Jun-2014). Clarification was added that the number of blood draws was reduced for participants who did not 
weigh enough to collect all blood samples for the study. The maximum amount of blood collected remained at 
5% of the participant’s total blood volume. The rationale for this change was that many participants 4 and 5 
years of age did not meet the minimum weight requirement for the study. In order to enroll younger 
participants, the weight requirement was being removed and the number of blood samples was reduced to 
accommodate the volume allowed for younger and smaller participants. 
Protocol deviations 
A total of 107 protocol violations were reported, none of which were deemed to have an impact on the 
assessment of the primary and secondary objectives.  
Baseline data 
Table 16 summarizes the demographic and clinical characteristics per age cohort of all 48 patients who were 
enrolled in the study and received at least one dose of the Study Drug. The mean (SD) age in the 4 –<8 year old 
cohort was 6.5 (1.2) years old. In the 8-<12 year old cohort, mean (SD) age was 11.1 (0.8) years old and in the 
12-<17 year old cohort mean (SD) age was 14.6 (1.6) years old. In all age cohorts, the population was 
predominantly male (83.3% in the 4-<8 year old cohort; 55.6% in the 8-<12 year old cohort; 58.3% in the 
12-<17 year old cohort), and ethnicity was predominantly White Non-Hispanic (100% in the 4-<8 year old 
cohort; 88.9% in the 8-<12 year old cohort; 83.3% in the 12-<17 year old cohort). As expected, duration of 
diabetes increased as age cohort increased, with a mean (SD) disease duration of: 2.8 (1.3) years in the 4-<8 
year old cohort; 4.9 (1.8) years in the 8-<12 year old cohort; 6.6 (3.9) in the 12-<17 year old cohort. The 
proportion of patients in the 4-<8 year old age cohort who reported a severe hypoglycaemic event in the last 
365 days (23%; n=4) was higher compared to the 8-<12 year old age cohort (11%; n=2) and the 12-<17 year 
old age cohort (8%; n=1).

Numbers analysed 
The primary analysis (PK and PD) and exploratory analyses (inferential statistics, PK/PD relationship, time to 
maximum blood glucose concentrations, and time to achieving an increase in blood glucose of ≥ 20 mg/dL and 
≥25 mg/dL) included all participants who provide evaluable data for at least one of the treatments. One (1) 
patient’s 2mg IN glucagon Dosing Visit (patient E057-0006; 4-<8 year old group) was excluded from the 
primary and exploratory analyses due to the fact that he blew his nose immediately after glucagon 
administration. In addition, one patient in the 12-<17 year old group (patient E057-0003) had a repeat 3mg IN 
Dosing Visit due to insufficient administration of glucagon (device malfunction during the initial Dosing Visit - the 
design defect that led to the device malfunction was corrected to prevent future malfunction) during the first 
Dosing Visit; this first visit was therefore considered as ineligible and not included in the efficacy and safety 
analyses. Therefore, all 48 patients who received at least one dose of Study Drug, had all completed Study Visits 
included in the primary analysis, with the exception of patient E057-0006, whose Dosing Visit was not 
considered as valid. The secondary analysis (safety and tolerability) included all completed Dosing Visits, 
regardless of validity.

Overall, all 48 patients were included in the Primary, Safety, and Exploratory Analyses, with 84 Dosing Visits 
included in the Safety Analysis, and 82 Dosing Visits included in the Primary and Exploratory Analyses.

2.5.3.  Supportive study(ies) 
Study I18R-MC-IGBI 
Study IGBI was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, 2-treatment, 2-period, crossover study conducted in 
adult patients with T1D. The primary objective of the study was to compare NG 3 mg commercial drug product 
and IMG 1 mg in the percent of adult patients with T1D achieving treatment success during controlled 
insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Once patient’s glucose level was <60 mg/dl (3.3 mmol/L), the insulin infusion 
was stopped and approximately 5 minutes later NG or IMG was administered. 
Figure 19 illustrates the study design for Study IGBI. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients 
achieving treatment success.

The primary endpoint in Study IGBI was the proportion of patients with T1D achieving “treatment success” 
during controlled insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Treatment success was defined as an increase in glucose to ≥
70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) or an increase of ≥20 mg/dL (1.1 mmol/L) from the glucose nadir within 30 minutes after 
receiving glucagon.  
Seventy patients were randomized and received at least 1 dose of study drug. Sixty-nine patients completed the 
study. One patient discontinued the study due to an adverse event (AE) of vomiting. Three patients were 
excluded from the primary efficacy analysis since they had 1 treatment visit in which the nadir glucose 
concentration was ≥70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), leaving 66 patients with T1D included in the efficacy analysis set. 
No patients received oral carbohydrates during the assessment period of treatment response. 
Of the 70 enrolled patients, the mean (SD) age of participants was 41.7 (12.7) years. The majority of patients 
were male (N=43, 61.4%). The mean (SD) age of disease duration was 19.8 (10.6) years. All (100%) patients 
were white. Mean (SD) HbA1c levels at baseline were 7.3% (0.9%). 
Glucose Nadir Values 
Glucose nadir values for the 66 patients with T1D in the Efficacy Analysis Set are presented in Table 21. 
Table 14 Glucose Nadir Values in the Efficacy Analysis Set in Study IGBI 
Proportion of Patients with Treatment Success 
The proportions of patients in the NG and IMG treatment groups achieving treatment success were 100% and 
100%, respectively in the Efficacy Analysis Set, as presented in  
Table 22. Nasal glucagon demonstrated non-inferiority to IMG in reversing insulin-induced hypoglycaemia 
since the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference is less than the non-inferiority margin of 10%. The 
proportions of patients achieving other glucose criteria are also presented by treatment group in this table. 
These results confirm the efficacy of NG commercial drug product to IMG. 
Of the 66 patients in the Efficacy Analysis set, 3 patients in each group had glucose nadir <50 mg/dL (2.8 
mmol/L) prior to glucagon dosing in both dosing visits. All these patients achieved treatment success within 30 
minutes in both dosing visits.

Table 15 Proportion of Patients with Treatment Success in Study IGBI 
Blood Glucose Change Over Time 
For patients in the Full Analysis Set, nadir glucose levels were 55.2 mg/dL (3.1 mmol/L) and 56 mg/dL (3.1 
mmol/L) for NG and IMG respectively. 
Both NG 3 mg and IMG 1 mg rapidly raised glucose levels and produced mean glucose levels above 70 mg/dL 
(3.9 mmol/L) by 10 minutes post-glucagon dosing (Figure 20). Glucose levels of both treatment groups 
continued to rise thereafter. Nasal glucagon 3 mg demonstrated a similar glycemic response to IMG 1 mg 
through 40 minutes post-glucagon dosing. After the 40-minute time point the glucose profiles began to diverge; 
whereas the glucose profile with NG began to plateau by 60 minutes, the glucose profile with IMG continued to 
increase.

Time to Treatment Success 
Time to treatment success represents time from glucagon administration to patients achieving treatment 
success; it does not include glucagon dose preparation time (for example, reconstitution time for IMG). 
For patients in the Efficacy Analysis set, the mean time to treatment success was 11.4 and 9.9 minutes in the NG 
and IMG treatment groups, respectively . The time to reach an increase of ≥20 mg/dL (1.1 mmol/L) from glucose 
nadir was 12.4 and 11.2 minutes in the NG and IMG treatment groups, respectively. 
Edinburgh Hypoglycemia Symptom Questionnaire 
In this study, the Edinburgh Hypoglycemia Symptom Questionnaire was administered to patients to collect data 
of 13 signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia.  
Symptoms of hypoglycemia, as represented by mean total scores, were mild and similar for both the NG (16.6) 
and IMG (16.2) groups prior to glucagon administration. There were no statistically significant differences 
between treatments in total score or subscale scores at either baseline or at any postdose time point. 
Furthermore, the total score and subscale scores were low compared to the maximum possible scores.

Summary of Study IGBI 
Results from this clinical bridging and confirmatory study are consistent with what was observed in pivotal Study 
IGBC. Nasal glucagon commercial product raised glucose levels rapidly and demonstrated non-inferiority in 
treatment success compared to IMG for the correction of insulin-induced hypoglycemia in T1D patients.

Study B002 
In an adult actual use study (B002), patients with type 1 diabetes and their caregivers were dispensed Baqsimi 
to treat moderate or severe hypoglycaemic events in the home or work setting. A total of 157 moderate or 
severe hypoglycaemic events reported by 69 patients were included in the efficacy analysis. In 151 (96.2 %) of 
these events, patients awoke or returned to normal status within 30 minutes following Baqsimi administration. 
In all (100 %) 12 severe hypoglycaemic events, patients awoke, stopped convulsions or returned to normal 
status within 5 to 15 minutes following Baqsimi administration.

Study B001 
In a paediatric actual use study (B001), patients aged 4 to < 18 years old with type 1 diabetes and their 
caregivers were dispensed 3 mg Baqsimi to treat moderate or severe hypoglycaemic events in the home or 
school setting. A total of 33 moderate hypoglycaemic events reported by 14 patients were included in the 
efficacy analysis. In all events, including clinically significant hypoglycaemia with a glucose level < 3.0 mmol/L  
(< 54 mg/dL), patients returned to normal status within 5 to 30 minutes following Baqsimi administration. 
Study IGBE 
Study IGBE was a single-center, open-label, 2-period, parallel study that assessed the impact of nasal 
decongestant and common cold on NG 3 mg PK and PD in 36 otherwise healthy adults. Common cold symptoms 
were assessed using the 8-item Jackson cold scale and peak nasal flow measurements were done before each 
glucagon administration. 
Subjects with nasal congestion and/or nasal discharge associated with a common cold were randomly assigned 
to cohort 1 or 2. In Cohort 1, 18 subjects (9 males, 9 females, mean age [SD]: 32 [9]) received a single NG 3 
mg dose. After a 7- to 28-day washout period, and after being cold-symptom-free for at least 2 days, these 
subjects received a second NG 3 mg dose. In total, 17 of 18 subjects completed both periods. In Cohort 2, 18 
subjects (8 males, 10 females, mean age [SD]: 29 [8]) were given a dose (i.e. 2 sprays) of oxymetazoline, a 
nasal decongestant, in both nostrils 2 hours before a single NG 3 mg dose. This cohort did not receive a second 
dose of NG. In both cohorts, subjects fasted overnight for at least 10 hours before glucagon administration and 
continued fasting for at least 3 hours postdose. Blood samples were collected to measure baseline glucagon and 
glucose levels 30, 15, and ≤5 minutes (time 0) before NG dosing, and further samples were collected 5, 10, 15, 
20, 30, 40, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 minutes after dosing.

2.5.4.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
One pivotal study was conducted to compare the response of NG 3 mg with IMG 1 mg in a controlled clinical 
setting in adult patients.  Study IGBC was a randomized, multicenter, open-label, in-patient, insulin-induced 
hypoglycemia study in 83 patients 18 to 65 years of age with T1D or T2D.  The study was conducted at sites in 
the US.  The patient population was predominantly white; the majority were diagnosed with T1D.   
The primary efficacy outcome measure was the proportion of patients achieving treatment success, which was 
defined as either an increase in blood glucose to ≥70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) or an increase of ≥20 mg/dL (1.1 
mmol/L) from glucose nadir within 30 minutes after receiving study glucagon without receiving additional 
actions to increase the blood glucose level.   
One pivotal study was conducted to compare the response of NG with IMG in a controlled clinical setting in 
pediatric patients.  In addition to the comparison of NG 3 mg to weight-based IMG, the study also included a 
comparison of NG 2 mg with NG 3 mg as well as a comparison of NG 2 mg to weight-based IMG.  Study IGBB was 
a multicenter, randomized, in-patient, crossover study in 48 patients 4 to <17 years of age with T1D.  The study 
was conducted at sites in the US.  Study IGBB was conducted in accordance with the iPSP agreed to by the 
Sponsor and the US FDA, and was agreed to by EMA/Paediatric Committee (PDCO) as part of the PIP. 
A margin of 10% was used in Study IGBC to assess the non-inferiority of NG to IMG. The Applicant`s justification 
for the non-inferiority margin of 10% is considered not adequate (according to the Applicant the margin of 10% 
was chosen based on data for glucagon injection in a simulated emergency study where 10% of children and 
adolescents did not receive any glucagon at all due to difficulties in reconstituting the IM preparation). Albeit a 
difference in 10% between anti-hypoglycaemic treatments may be clinically relevant, the magnitude of the 
non-inferiority margin will not be further discussed (no implication in light of the well comparable results). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the NG clinical development program, doses ranging from 0.5 mg to 6 mg have been studied. In essence, a 
clear dose-response has not been established in the pharmacology and clinical studies. All studies investigating 
more than one dose of NG, were performed with a formulation distinct from the commercial formulation. The 
latter showed considerable differences in PK (Cmax about twice as high in adults, and extrapolated about 4-fold 
as high in children). An integrated dose-response analysis performed across studies estimated that NG 3 mg 
produced 87% of the maximal response (estimated as 81 mg/dl glucose increase), whereas NG 2 mg produced 
73%. However, considerable variability between studies renders this integrated analysis difficult to interpret. 
Taken together, as the primary goal of rescue treatment is to quickly restore blood glucose and safety concerns 
associated with high exposure will -in most instances – be less significant than therapeutic failure, use of the NG 
3 mg dose in adults and adolescents is supported.

Existing data indicate that 3 mg nasal glucagon fully occupies the glucagon receptors for a short period of time 
and that any excess glucagon has no biological effects (maybe except for GLP-1 receptor stimulation which is not 
considered hazardous; it may cause additional nausea). Therefore, using the adult dose also for young children 
is acceptable. In the pivotal study in adults (IGBC) in the primary analysis population, comprised of patients with 
T1D with a glucose nadir of <70 mg/dl (N=75), the proportions of patients in the NG 3 mg and IMG 1 mg 
treatment groups who achieved treatment success were 98.7% and 100%, respectively. The difference in the 
proportion of patients who achieved treatment success was 1.3%, with the 1-sided upper 97.5% confidence 
interval of 4.0%, which is below the non-inferiority margin of 10%; thus, in principle, NG demonstrated 
non-inferiority to IMG in reversing insulin-induced hypoglycemia (still, a definite conclusion is subject to the 
clarification of the a. m. methodological shortcomings with respect to the primary analysis; in particular, missing 
pre-specification and validity of the primary analysis). 
The critical findings in the GCP inspection of Study IGBB in respect to source data handling most likely also apply 
for the pivotal adult study IGBC because data handling was similar. PK data cannot be relied upon due to 
inadequate sample processing; this impacts PD data to a lesser extent, which therefore seem to be reliable.  
In the primary analysis population, 97.3% of patients in the NG 3 mg treatment group and 98.7% of patients in 
the IMG 1 mg treatment group achieved both glucose criteria of treatment success. Of the five patients with T2D 
included in the efficacy analysis, 100% achieved treatment success with NG and IMG within 30 minutes of 
glucagon administration. The sensitivity analysis conducted in patients with T1D with a glucose nadir of <50 
mg/dl at both dosing visits (n=39 [52%]) also demonstrated non-inferiority to IMG in the proportion of patients 
achieving treatment success. 
Patients in the primary analysis population had a mean time to treatment success of 16.2 minutes and 12.2 
minutes in the NG and IMG treatment groups, respectively. In clinical practice, time starts at the caregiver`s 
decision to dose. Therefore, the time needed to reconstitute the IMG would delay administration. Hence, the 4 
min difference in study IGBC is unlikely to occur in the real-world setting. 
Symptom scores in the hypoglycemia questionnaire were similar for the NG (20.6) and IMG (20.0) groups prior 
to glucagon administration. Most patients in both treatment groups had mild symptoms. At 30 minutes, both 
treatment groups had a 20% decrease in symptoms from baseline, indicating similar improvement of symptoms 
of hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia symptoms for both treatment groups continued to improve through 45 minutes.  
In the pivotal study in the pediatric population (study IGBB) all (100%) patients in both treatment arms across 
all age groups achieved an increase in glucose ≥20 mg/dl from nadir within 30 minutes of glucagon 
administration. All patients across all treatment and age groups achieved this increase in glucose within 20 
minutes post-glucagon administration. This was confirmed by an analysis applying the original response 
criterion: all patients achieved an increase in glucose ≥25mg/dL by 20 minutes post glucagon administration. 
An additional post-hoc analysis of a subgroup of patients (n=6 IMG; n=9 NG 3 mg) whose glucose nadir was <70 
mg/dl was performed using the same primary endpoint criteria used in the adult efficacy integrated analysis. All 
6 patients (100%) in the injectable glucagon group (mean glucose nadir of 58.2 mg/dl) and all 9 patients 
(100%) in the NG group (mean glucose nadir of 60.7 mg/dl) achieved treatment success of a glucose increase 
to ≥70 mg/dl or an increase of ≥20 mg/dl from nadir within 30 minutes of glucagon administration. In addition, 
all 6 patients (100%) in IMG group and all 9 patients (100%) in the NG 3 mg group met both of the glucose 
criteria.

The average time to achieve glucose increase of ≥20 mg/dl and ≥25 mg/dl, respectively, was determined. 
Results were similar for NG 3mg and IMG across all age groups (for an increase ≥20 mg/dl: young children IMG 
10.0 minutes, NG 10.8 minutes; children IMG 12.5 minutes, NG 11.3 minutes; adolescents IMG 12.5 minutes, 
NG 14.2 min). 
The clinical bridging and confirmatory study (IGBI) served to compare the commercial and the clinical trial drug 
products.  
The proportions of patients in the NG and IMG treatment groups achieving treatment success were 100% and 
100%, respectively, and non-inferiority was shown. Three patients in each group had a glucose nadir <50 mg/dl 
prior to glucagon dosing in both dosing visits. All these patients achieved treatment success within 30 minutes 
in both dosing visits. The mean time to treatment success was 11.4 and 9.9 minutes in the NG and IMG 
treatment groups, respectively  
Symptoms of hypoglycemia as assessed in the hypoglycemia questionnaire, as represented by mean total 
scores, were similar for both the NG (16.6) and IMG (16.2) groups prior to glucagon administration. At 30 min 
post-dose mean total scores were 14.3 (-2.3) for NG and 14.5 (-1.7) for IMG. Scores are considered generally 
low (reflecting a population with milder forms of hypoglycaemia), compared with the maximum possible scores 
(7x13=91).  
In the actual use study in adults (B002) 157 hypoglycemic events (from 69 patients) were evaluable, of which 
151 (96.2%) met the primary endpoint, defined as patients awakened or returned to normal status within 30 
minutes following NG administration. The six events (3.8%) not resolved within 30 minutes were all moderate 
hypoglycemic events; 1 had a blood glucose level that returned to normal (>70mg/dl) by 30 minutes but had a 
persistent headache, and 5 events had returned to normal status between 30 and 45 minutes without the use of 
additional measures to raise glucose levels. Importantly, all severe hypoglycemic events (n=12) resolved. No 
caregivers called for external professional emergency medical assistance. In 80.5% of events caregivers 
reported that it was easy to administer NG and that they were satisfied with the use of NG (94.4% of events). 
In the pediatric actual use study (B001) all moderate hypoglycemic events (n=33, 100%) from all 14 patients 
in the efficacy analysis met the primary endpoint. No severe hypoglycemic events were reported. This may be 
due to the fact that symptoms of hypoglycemia and physiological hormone responses may occur at a higher 
glucose level in children compared to adults (Ly et al., 2014) and that most caregivers intervene before severe 
hypoglycemia sets in. Clinically significant hypoglycemia or major hypoglycemia, defined as a blood glucose 
level of <54mg/dl was, however, reported; all these events (n = 17) were resolved within 30 minutes. In this 
study, no caregivers called for external professional emergency medical assistance. No patients ingested oral 
carbohydrates or used an injectable glucagon kit before the hypoglycemic event was resolved. For most of the 
hypoglycemic events (93.9%), caregivers reported that it was easy or very easy to administer NG and that they 
were satisfied with the use of NG. 
As an additional analysis an indirect between-study comparison was conducted between study IGBC and IGBI 
which showed a comparable efficacy in terms of treatment success between the NG 3 mg clinical trial drug 
product in the and the NG 3 mg commercial drug product. Difference in time to treatment success between NG 
and IMG (NG minus IMG) was 1.5 min for study IGBI, which was slightly shorter than what was observed in 
study IGBC (4 min). The shorter time to treatment success shown in this between study comparison may well be 
due to the difference in Cmax (tmax was however comparable, please refer to PK section of this report). Overall, 
this additional analysis shows that the clinical implications of the observed differences in PK are likely to be 
modest and justify the conclusion of comparable efficacy in adults and adolescents.

Elderly patients were not sufficiently represented in the clinical studies. In studies IGBC and IGBI patients up to 
65 and 64 years, respectively, were enrolled; the study population was young (mean age: 32.9 years IGBC, 42.7 
years IGBI). In the adult actual use study B002 patients up to 75 years could be included, the oldest patient 
included was 71 years. Older patients are at increased risk of hypoglycemia since they tend to be frail and on 
polypharmacy. 
It is agreed that the available data (including newly submitted data of study ICGJ) in patients above 65 years of 
age (no patient above the age of 70 was included in the study program) hint at an efficacy and safety profile in 
line with the one in younger patients. The issue, that data in patients above the age of 70 are missing, is now 
reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC by the following sentence:  
“There are only limited data on the safety and efficacy of X in patients aged 65 years and above and no such data 
in patients aged 70 and above.”  
Adults 
In the primary analysis population, comprised of patients with T1D with a glucose nadir of <70 mg/dL (3.9 
mmol/L) (N=75), the proportions of patients in the NG 3 mg and IMG 1 mg treatment groups who achieved 
treatment success were 98.7% and 100%, respectively.  The difference in the proportion of patients who 
achieved treatment success was 1.3%, with the 1-sided upper 97.5% confidence interval of 4.0%, which is 
below the NIM of 10%; thus, NG demonstrated non-inferiority to IMG in reversing insulin-induced 
hypoglycemia. 
Paediatric patients 
All (100%) patients in both treatment arms across all age groups achieved a glucose increase of ≥20 mg/dL (1.1 
mmol/L) and ≥25 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L) from nadir within 20 minutes of glucagon administration.  The mean 
times to achieve these increases were similar for NG and IMG across all age groups.  In both treatment groups 
across all age groups, glucose levels started to rise quickly.  Across all age groups, NG 3 mg demonstrated a 
glycemic response similar to IMG, and glucose levels continued to rise through 60 minutes post glucagon 
administration. 
2.5.5.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of glucagon is unquestionable; in this application the focus is on demonstrating efficacy of the 
intranasal administration.   
The pivotal adult study (Study IGBC) enrolled limited number of patients with T2D but their glucose response 
over time following NG administration was similar to adult patients with T1D. 
In the primary analysis population, comprised of patients with T1D with a glucose nadir of <70 mg/dL (3.9 
mmol/L) (N=75), the proportions of patients in the NG 3 mg and IMG 1 mg treatment groups who achieved 
treatment success were 98.7% and 100%, respectively.   
The time to treatment success was 2 to 4 minutes longer for patients treated with NG 3 mg compared to patients 
treated with IMG 1 mg. 
All (100%) pediatric patients in both treatment arms across all age groups in Study IGBB achieved a glucose 
increase of ≥20 mg/dL (1.1 mmol/L) and ≥25 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L) from nadir within 20 minutes of glucagon 
administration. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/602404/2019 
Page 88/116 
 
 
 
   
  
 
In the pivotal controlled studies, NG 3 mg produced clinically relevant increases in response to insulin-induced 
(moderate) hypoglycaemia, showing comparable success rates as IMG. These findings are supported by 
actual-use studies which evaluated effectiveness of NG in the treatment of moderate to severe hypoglycaemia 
in a real world setting. In these studies, the caregivers successfully delivered NG in a stressful setting, and no 
caregivers called for external professional emergency medical assistance. In addition, for most of the 
hypoglycaemic events, caregivers reported that it was easy to administer NG compared to injectable glucagon 
and that they were satisfied with the use of NG. 
Albeit the number of T2DM patients included in the development program was low, an indication comprising 
both types of diabetes is considered justified, as the mechanism of action is unlikely to be different in T2DM 
patients. The time to treatment success was 2 to 4 minutes longer for patients treated with NG 3 mg compared 
to patients treated with IMG 1 mg; however, the time required for the multistep preparation of injectable 
glucagon was not included, thereby disfavouring NG. 
The adult and pediatric pivotal studies did not assess efficacy in severe hypoglycaemia, since induction of this 
condition is unethical (even more so in children). However, increases in glucose from normoglycemic baseline 
have likewise been used as a biomarker to support approval of injectable glucagon products. Extrapolation of 
results to severe hypoglycaemia is considered eligible. 
A routine GCP inspection of the paediatric study IGBB yielded critical findings related to sample processing and 
data handling which cannot be corrected post-hoc. In the paediatric study IGBB the data recording system 
provided by the sponsor was not GCP compliant. Part of the information stored in the eCFRs could be verified by 
independent recordings at the individual study sites.  
 The results of the newly performed analysis taking these data detected at the individual study sites into account 
(including patients for whom >90% of source data were available) are in agreement with the previous analysis 
including the entire patient population. The MO pertaining to GCP non-compliance of the data recording system 
for study IGBB has been considered addressed 
The critical findings in the GCP inspection of Study IGBB in respect to source data handling may also apply for 
the pivotal adult study IGBC because data handling was similar.  but according to the inspectors this impacts PD 
data of Study IGBC to a lesser extent. The Applicant has provided convincing evidence that the newer studies, 
using the commercial Baqsimi product, are sufficient to support MAA of Baqsimi in adults.

A total of 499 patients, including 70 patients <18 years of age, received the study drug (either NG or IMG) in the 
11 completed clinical studies (Table 25) Of these patients, 461 received NG, with 421 patients receiving the 3 
mg dose proposed for registration. Additionally, of these 461 NG-treated patients, 365 were patients with T1D, 
44 were patients with T2D, and 52 were adults without diabetes. A total of 234 patients received IMG at the 
approved dose of 0.5 mg or 1 mg. 
Since most studies employed a crossover design, many patients received both NG and IMG, so the total number 
of patients is less than the sum of NG patients and IMG patients.

Overall Adult Exposure 
Table  26 presents a summary of exposure to NG and IMG by dose for all adult patients in the 9 NG clinical 
studies. A total of 403 adult patients received at least 1 dose of NG in the adult studies. 
Approximately 45% of the patients (178/403) received more than 1 dose of NG (maximum of 11 doses), and the 
majority  of  patients  (363/403  [90.1%])  received  the  3  mg  dose  proposed  for  registration.  In  addition,  210 
patients received at least 1 dose of IMG, which was either a subcutaneous or intramuscular injection of 1 mg 
glucagon, dependent on the study. 
Table 19 Summary of Exposure Adult Patients in the Nasal Glucagon Clinical Studies (IGBA, IGBC, 
IGBD, IGBE, IGBF, IGBG, IGBH, IGBI, and B00
Although data are limited for the pediatric subgroup of the target population, the CHMP agreed that safety data 
generated in both, adults and younger patients can provide reassurance regarding the safety of NG in the total 
target population.  
Hypoglycemia  is  a  common  side  effect  in  patients  treated  with  insulin,  which  potentially  leads  to  repetitive 
administration  of  glucagon.  This  was  also  seen  in  different  trials,  where  patients  received  up  to  11 
administrations of the study drug.

While patients with DT2 are more prevalent in the society, they were less represented in the trials. It is accepted 
that both groups of patients with DT1 or DT2 have similar side effects due to exposure from administration of 
glucagon.  
Adverse events 
Adverse events were collected and assessed in 2 complementary ways: as spontaneously reported AEs and as 
symptoms solicited through questionnaires. 
The percentage of patients suffering at least one AE differed between the studies. In study IGBC, 55.4% and 
45.1% reported at least one AE with Baqsimi and GlucaGen, respectively; in Study IGBI the percentages were 
44.3% vs. 46.4% (nasal vs. IM) and in Study IGBF 100% vs. 80.8% (nasal vs. injected). The higher AE 
incidence in Study IGBF is probably due to the fact that in the latter the participants received three glucagon 
administrations instead of one as in the other studies. 
Adverse Events in Adults 
Table 27 presents a summary of TEAEs reported in at least 2% of patients in either the NG 3 mg or IMG 
treatment groups at the preferred term level, by SOC and treatment group.

Table 20 Summary of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events in At Least 2% of Patients in Either 
Treatment Group by System Organ Class, Preferred Term and Treatment Group Study IGBC 
At least 1 TEAE was reported by 55.4% of NG-treated patients and 45.1% of IMG-treated patients. Very 
commonly reported TEAEs (≥10% of patients) in the NG 3 mg group were nausea, headache, and vomiting. 
Nausea and vomiting were reported with similar incidences in the NG 3 mg and IMG groups. 
In addition, nasal/respiratory/anosmia TEAEs (a subset of all TEAEs) were very commonly reported (≥10% of 
patients) in the NG 3 mg group. Only TAE’s from the upper respiratory tract (the area of the nose) are observed. 
Supportive Analyses from Additional Integrated Datasets 
Eye Disorders 
Lacrimation Increased 
One hundred twenty-two (52.1%) NG-treated patients and 2 (1.4%) IMG-treated patients reported lacrimation 
increased. Four events (NG) were severe, but none of the events were considered serious. In all studies the 
events were resolved within 1 day.

Ocular Hyperemia 
Fifty-two (22.2%) NG-treated patients and 2 (1.4%) IMG-treated patients reported ocular hyperemia. One 
event (NG) was severe but was not considered serious. In all studies, approximately 95% of the events resolved 
within 1 day. 
Eye Pruritus 
Thirty-four (14.5%) NG-treated patients and 3 (2.1%) IMG-treated patients reported eye pruritus. Two events 
(NG) were severe, but none of the events were considered serious. In  all studies, all events resolved within a 
day. 
Nervous System Disorders 
Headache 
Eighty-six (36.8%) NG-treated patients reported 114 TEAEs of headache, and 14 (9.9%) IMG-treated patients 
reported 16 events. Two events (NG) were severe, but none of the events were considered serious. Three events 
(NG, 1; IMG, 2) did not have a documented resolution during the study. In Study IGBC, where TEAE start 
date/time and end date/time were only recorded as a date, 18 of the 24 TEAEs of headache resolved within 1 
day, 5 events (NG, 2; IMG, 3) resolved in 1 to 2 days, and 1 event (NG) resolved in 2 to 3 days. In the other 
studies that recorded time in addition to date, approximately 50% of events resolved within 4 hours, 
approximately 92% of events resolved within 1 day, and approximately 8% of events took longer than 1 day to 
resolve. 
Headache is not a mentioned side effect in the SmPC of IMG. The Applicant explained the different 
manifestations of headache and the possible relationship with passing of glucagon through the blood-brain 
barrier. These explanations were accepted.  
Gastrointestinal Disorders 
Nausea and Vomiting 
Sixty-four (27.4%) NG-treated patients and a similar proportion of IMG-treated patients (38 [27.0%] patients) 
reported nausea. Four events (NG, 3; IMG, 1) were severe, but none were considered serious. In all studies, 
approximately 98% of events resolved within 1 day. 
Thirty-nine (16.7%) NG-treated patients and a similar proportion of IMG-treated patients (19 [13.5%] patients) 
reported vomiting. Three TEAEs (NG, 2; IMG, 1) of severe vomiting were reported by 2 patients; none of the 
events were considered serious. In all studies, approximately 97% of events resolved within 1 day. 
Hypersensitivity Reactions 
Terms identified from the search were: urticaria, rash, pruritus, eyelid edema, eye swelling, chest discomfort, 
and erythema. Ten (4.3%) NG-treated patients and 2 (1.4%) IMG-treated patients reported these events. All 
events were mild or moderate, with the exception of a TEAE of severe pruritus in Study IGBC, which began on 
the date of NG 3 mg administration. The event was considered related to study treatment and completely 
resolved within 4 days of receiving NG. 
While pruritus was the predominantly reported event (NG, 4; IMG, 1), it is not possible to determine whether 
these events were localized or systemic in nature based on the event terms reported. None of these events led 
to discontinuation or were reported as serious. Furthermore, none of these events occurred in patients who were 
treatment-emergent anti-drug antibody positive.

Adverse Events in Pediatrics 
The NG 3 mg dose in pediatric pivotal Study IGBB is the primary dataset used for determining the AE profile of 
NG. The combined NG 2 mg and NG 3 mg doses (NG_all) is used as a supportive dataset when a population-wide 
perspective is considered to be more informative. Therefore the labelling in the SmPC was modified accordingly. 
This approach was accepted by the CHMP. . Therefore the labelling in the SmPC was modified accordingly. This 
approach was accepted by the CHMP 
Table  28  presents  a  summary  of  all  TEAEs  reported  in  the  pediatric  pivotal  study,  by  preferred  term  and 
treatment group. Events are presented by decreasing frequency at the SOC level for the NG 3 mg group, and 
within each SOC, by decreasing frequency at the preferred term level for the NG 3 mg group. 
In the pediatric pivotal study, 55.6% of NG 3 mg-treated patients and 75.0% of IMG-treated patients reported 
at least 1 TEAE.  Very commonly reported TEAEs (≥10% of patients) in the NG 3 mg group at the preferred term 
level were vomiting, headache, and nausea. In the IMG group, nausea, vomiting, headache, and injection site 
discomfort were very commonly reported TEAEs, with similar incidences of nausea and vomiting as reported in 
the NG 3 mg group. 
In addition, nasal/respiratory/anosmia TEAEs were very commonly reported (≥10% of patients) in the NG 3 mg 
group.  The population in the Pediatric Pivotal Study IGBB is small though  (60 patients, with 36 in the NG 3 mg 
group). Adverse event are less reported in children compared to adults.  It is not excluded that younger patients 
do not report side effects because of their limited cognitive functions and therefore the difficulties to report 
adverse  events  correctly.  Therefore  the  labelling  in  the  SmPC  was  modified  accordingly.  This  approach  was 
accepted by the CHMP

Table 21 Summary of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events by System Organ Class, Preferred Term, 
and Treatment Group Pediatric Pivotal Study IGBB 
Of the nervous system disorders, headache was the most important side effect observed in children in the NG 
group.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The rates of SAE’s seen in all trials were low, both in children and adults. One SAE was reported in the 9 
completed adult studies. The event was an SAE of cellulitis (right leg), reported by a 54-year-old male patient 
with T2D in Study IGBG. The SAE was considered severe, unexpected, and not related to study treatment, but 
did lead to discontinuation of the patient from the study.  
One SAE was reported in the pediatric studies. The SAE of severe hypoglycemia, in pediatric pivotal Study IGBB, 
was reported by a 7-year-old male patient with T1D after receiving IMG in Study IGBB. The SAE was not 
considered related to study treatment, but was determined to be related to study procedures. 
One death was reported across the 9 completed adult studies (in Study B002 a patient experienced a Klebsiella 
infection approximately 5 weeks after his last dose of NG; developed acidosis, sepsis, and multiple organ failure 
and died 3 days later). No deaths occurred in the pediatric studies.

Laboratory findings 
Based on the intended use as an intermittent rescue medication and the decades of clinical experience with 
glucagon therapy according to the Applicant comprehensive laboratory assessments were not considered 
necessary and therefore, available laboratory data are limited. 
Only hematology parameters provided post baseline results. Additionally, the adult and pediatric pivotal studies, 
clinical bridging and confirmatory study, and actual-use studies provided no relevant clinical laboratory data 
because laboratory measurements were either collected only at baseline or not collected at all (in actual-use 
studies). No abnormal postdose laboratory values were judged to be clinically significant. 
Electrocardiograms were performed in some studies, but not for pediatric pivotal Study IGBB, the actual-use 
studies, or Study IGBI because these studies did not collect ECGs. There were no abnormal ECG findings in the 
NG program.  
Safety in special populations 
No safety data have been generated for special populations (patients with liver of renal impairment), or patients 
with hypertension. The risk profile of nasally applied glucagon in elderly, hepatic or renal impairment is 
considered to correspond to the risk profile of intravenously applied glucagon for which no specific measures are 
necessary. 
Immunological events 
Consistent with the immunogenic properties of protein and peptide therapeutics, individuals exposed to NG 
could develop an immune response, including formation of antidrug antibodies (ADA). 
Data from 3 studies of the NG development program (Studies IGBF, IGBG, and B002) demonstrated minimal 
incidence of treatment-emergent antidrug antibodies (TE ADA) for NG. The assays measured anti-glucagon 
antibodies in human serum using a ligand-binding assay, which had a target sensitivity of 250 to 500 ng/mL 
ADA. None of the patients with TE ADA experienced a hypersensitivity AE, and no patient developed neutralizing 
antibodies.  
The Applicant developed the US FDA- and European Medicines Agency (EMA)-compliant assays, and retested 
samples from Studies IGBF, IGBG, and B002. Results from these new assays showed minimal (2%) incidence of 
TE ADA, with a maximum titer of 1:80. No neutralizing antibodies were detected. There was no correlation 
between positive TE ADA results and AEs.  
Treatment-emergent (TE) ADA-positive patients have been defined by the Applicant as the sum of 
treatment-boosted ADA positive plus the treatment-induced ADA positive patients. Originally, the following 
definition was given by the Applicant for TE ADA-positive patient: If baseline result is ‘ADA Detected’, at least 1 
postbaseline titer that is a 4-fold or greater increase in titer from baseline measurement has been observed for 
treatment-boosted ADA-positive patients. If baseline result is ‘ADA Not Detected’, at least 1 post-baseline ADA 
‘Detected’ sample with a corresponding titer that is one 2-fold dilution higher than the minimal required 
dilution has been observed for treatment induced ADA-positive patients. Three patients from the three studies 
with immunogenicity data for NG glucagon were found to comply with this definition.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/602404/2019 
Page 97/116 
 
 
 
   
  
 
 
 
The original definition of the treatment-induced ADA-positive has been questioned since only the patients 
showing a titer twice the minimum required dilution (MRD) were considered. However, it is expected that 
putative ADA positive samples, further confirmed positive and showing a titer equal to the MRD at one or several 
postbaseline time points are considered in the integrated analysis of the clinical significance of immunogenicity. 
If patients showing 1 MRD positive results are also considered as TE ADA positive patients, four patients should 
be added. In total, 7 out of 124 ADA evaluable patients (5.6%) can be included in the TE ADA-positive patients 
group. The ADA incidence can be considered to be low and should be reported in the SmPC. All available clinical 
data indicate that there is no effect on PD, efficacy, or safety endpoints. 
With the responses to the D120 LoQ, an additional study with immunogenicity data was provided by the 
Applicant from the study IGBJ. In this study, one patient had an ADA titer of 1:40 at pre-hypoglycemia induction 
but ADA were not detected at early discontinuation (38 days postdose) and 1 patient had a positive ADA titer of 
1:40 at pre-hypoglycemia induction and was also positive for ADA with a titer of 1:40 at follow-up (36 days 
postdose). No rise in ADA titer were observed after glucagon administration. Thus, these observations do not 
support the development of an immune response following the administration of glucagon in this study.  
In summary, overall 5.6% of patients developed treatment-emergent anti-glucagon antibodies. These 
antibodies were not neutralising and did not lower the efficacy of glucagon nor were they associated with the 
development of treatment-emergent adverse reactions. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with NG. 
The label for GlucaGen (GlucaGen HypoKit UK SmPC 2015; GlucaGen HypoKit USPI 2015) list the following drug 
interactions relevant to treatment of severe hypoglycemia: 
•  Warfarin: glucagon may increase the anticoagulant effect of warfarin 
•  Beta-blockers: Patients taking beta-blockers might be expected to have a greater increase in both pulse 
and BP, which will be temporary because of glucagon’s short half-life. 
• 
Indomethacin: When used with indomethacin, glucagon may lose its ability to raise blood glucose or 
paradoxically may even produce hypoglycemia. 
No reproductive and developmental toxicity studies of NG have been conducted in animals.  
Glucagon  does  not  cross  the  human  placental  barrier.  The  use  of  NG  during  pregnancy,  if  needed,  is  not 
precluded  (Glucagon  for  Injection  Product  Monograph,  2012;  GlucaGen  HypoKit  UK  SmPC,  2015;  GlucaGen 
HypoKit Product Monograph, 2016; Glucagon for Injection USPI, 2017). 
It is not known whether glucagon is excreted in human milk. Glucagon nasal powder is a peptide and intact 
glucagon is not absorbed from the GI tract. Therefore, even if the infant ingested glucagon it would be unlikely 
to have any effect on the infant (GlucaGen HypoKit UK SmPC, 2015; GlucaGen HypoKit USPI, 2015; GlucaGen 
HypoKit Product Monograph, 2016). 
If over-dosage of glucagon occurs, the patient may experience nausea, vomiting, inhibition of gastrointestinal 
tract motility, increases in BP and pulse rate, and a decrease in serum potassium. Because glucagon has a short 
half-life, treatment of overdose is symptomatic, primarily for nausea, vomiting, and hypokalemia. If the patient 
develops a dramatic increase in BP, non-selective alpha-adreneric blockade has been shown to be effective in 
lowering BP for the short time that control would be needed.

Neither  NG  nor  the  active  comparators  have  a  known  profile  as  a  drug  of  abuse.  There  were  no  reported 
instances of intended drug abuse in the NG clinical program. 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. The patient’s ability to 
concentrate or react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. Until hypoglycemia has been adequately 
treated, the ability to drive vehicles or to operate machinery may be impaired. 
These  issues  are  adequately  reflected  under  sections  4.5,  4.6  and  4.7  respectively  of  the  SPC  No  separate 
interaction studies for NG are required. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
With the exception of Study IGBI, discontinuations due to AEs were not captured in study case report forms 
(CRFs) or reported in CSRs; therefore, all study discontinuations were retrospectively reviewed to identify any 
that may have been due to an AE.  
Overall Adult Disposition 
Forty of 403 (9.9%) NG-treated patients and 2 of 210 (1.0%) IMG-treated patients discontinued prematurely 
from the 9 completed studies in adult patients (please refer to 
Table 29). 
One patient (NG) died due to an AE not considered related to study drug, and another 9 patients (NG, 7 [1.7%]; 
IMG, 2 [1.0%]) discontinued due to AEs. Four of the 7 NG discontinuations due to AE occurred in NG studies 
without a IMG comparator. 
Other reasons for discontinuation of NG-treated patients were withdrawal by patient (6 [1.5%]), physician 
decision (2 [0.5%]), Sponsor’s decision (19 [4.7%]), and protocol violation (5 [1.2%]). Thirty of the 32 
discontinuations for other reasons occurred in NG studies without a IMG comparator. No IMG-treated patients 
discontinued due to reasons other than AE. 
It is noted that discontinuation of treatment during the trials in adults is lower than in paediatric patients in both 
groups (NG versus IMG). However, discontinuation rate 10 times higher was observed in the NG treated group 
and subsequent to adverse events due to sponsor`s decision. The Applicant explained that there is a comparable 
rate for discontinuation between NG and injectable glucagon in the trials where both NG and IMG are used. The 
remaining discontinuations of treatment are in the trials, where only NG was used, without possibility to 
compare with IMG, which gives the impression that the discontinuations in NG are higher. This explanation was 
accepted by the CHMP.

Overall Pediatric Disposition 
Twelve of 58 (20.7%) NG-treated patients and no IMG-treated patients discontinued from Study IGBB or B001 
prematurely. 
There were 4 discontinuations due to AEs (NG, 4 [6.9%]; IMG, 0). Three of the 4 discontinuations due to AEs 
(nasal discomfort) occurred in uncontrolled NG Study B001. The other reason for discontinuation of NG-treated 
patients was Sponsor’s decision to terminate a site because of good clinical practice (GCP) noncompliance in 
uncontrolled Study B001. 
In children the discontinuation rate is much higher than in adults and 20 times higher in the NG than in the IMG 
group, also mostly due to sponsor`s decision. The Applicant was requested to clarify this high amount of 
withdrawals by the sponsor in children. The Applicant explained that there is a comparable rate for 
discontinuation between NG and injectable glucagon in the trial where both NG and IMG were studied. The 
remaining discontinuations of treatment are in the trial where only NG was used, without possibility to compare 
with IMG, which gives the impression that the discontinuations in NG are higher. This explanation was accepted 
by the CHMP.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of NG includes well-known effects of glucagon treatment and no important identified risks 
have been observed in the NG program. Moreover, the safety results were consistent across the different 
studies. Glucagon administration caused GI side effects irrespective of the route of administration. In case of 
nasal administration, local symptoms were frequently observed which were not confined to the nose but also 
encompassed irritation of eyes and throat as well as headache. These symptoms were transient and were not 
considered serious. No major differences were observed between children and adults. Local nasal and non-nasal 
symptoms were systematically collected via a questionnaire.   
However, next to the already well known adverse events as mentioned in the SmPC of IMG, in NG treated 
patients was headache a common adverse events.  
It cannot be excluded that the observed irritation of the upper airways may in some cases be accompanied by 
potentially hazardous events such as bronchoconstriction, dyspnoea, difficulty to breathe or suffocation fear. 
The AE reports as submitted by the Applicant do not give a hint for this, but such events obviously were not 
systematically collected. Only one case of anxiety was spontaneously reported in the NG group of Study IGBC. 
The applicant considers it unlikely that hazardous events related to the airways (e.g. dyspnoea, 
bronchoconstriction) were overlooked, noting that study participants were instructed to carefully report any 
relevant event and that studies in animals did not show distribution of Baqsimi powder to the lower airways. On 
the other hand, under-reporting of events related to respiration cannot fully be excluded because the applicant 
confirmed that such events were not specifically followed as AEs of special interest. Thus, some uncertainties 
remain, but in general it can be agreed to the applicant’s position that serious respiratory events most likely 
would have been reported. Further information will be obtained from post-marketing observations. 
The safety database for NG was sufficient in scope to adequately characterize the safety profile of NG in the 
elderly adult (mostly <65 years) and pediatric patients (all >4 years) with diabetes given the intended use of NG 
and the history of safe use with the currently approved injectable glucagon products.  Others than Caucasian 
patients were not included in the safety database. Moreover, the patients who received only 3mg NG are only a 
small amount of the investigated patient group. Patients with DT2 were under-investigated in the trials, 
although they represent the highest diabetes population in general daily practice. However, it is accepted that 
no difference in adverse events in both type I and type II diabetes is expected.   
It is noticed that the adverse events are not different between children and adults, although adverse events are 
less reported in children than in adults. This could be due to the way of symptom collection via a questionnaire 
which obviously was developed for adults and which could be difficult to understand for children. It is not 
excluded that children were not able to answer the questions adequately in the used questionnaires. Thus, AEs 
in younger children could be under-reported. The applicant could not exclude under-reporting of AEs in children 
and therefore suggests modifying the labelling in the SmPC accordingly. This approach is accepted. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/602404/2019 
Page 101/116 
 
 
 
   
  
 
 
 
Furthermore, it has to be assumed that the maximal plasma level (Cmax) of glucagon will be higher with the 
current Baqsimi preparation intended for marketing than with the preparation used in the paediatric study IGBB 
because higher glucagon Cmax has been observed in the most recently conducted studies in adults (IGBJ and 
IGBI) which utilized commercial process drug product. This could be a safety problem because children down to 
the age of four years are intended to receive the same dose as adults, i.e. 3 mg. This is justified by the 
acceptable tolerability of 3 mg in children in Study IGBB. However, comparison of the PK results of the adult 
studies IGBC and IGBI shows that the newer powder leads to a nearly doubled Cmax. A routine GCP inspection 
of the paediatric study IGBB yielded critical findings related to data handling which cannot be corrected 
post-hoc.   
In the paediatric study IGBB the data recording system provided by the sponsor was not GCP compliant. Part of 
the information stored in the eCFRs could be verified by independent recordings at the individual study sites. The 
applicant was asked for how many patients ≥90% of data are available for both visits and to perform a 
re-evaluation of the study results using these patients only. According to the applicant’s response to the GCP 
inspection report, data from around 60% of the visits could be rescued to a large extent (≥90% of data verified). 
The re-analyses based on source documentation availability in Study IGBB demonstrate a benefit/risk profile 
consistent with the one determined based on the complete dataset. The MO pertaining to GCP non-compliance 
of the data recording system could be addressed through the availability of independent recordings of eCFR data 
at the individual study sites. The results of the newly performed analysis taking these data detected at the 
individual study sites into account (including patients for whom >90% of source data were available) are in 
agreement with the previous analysis including the entire patient population. 
As with all development programs, the safety evaluation for NG could not detect very rare adverse effects, 
adverse effects with long latency, or adverse effects caused by prolonged or cumulative exposure. It is accepted 
that these limitations are less meaningful for NG because the treatment indication is for acute potentially 
life-saving episodic use and not for chronic administration. However, several patients received several 
administrations of NG during a short time period.   
The adverse effects and the potential risk associated with NG will be managed through routine measures 
including labelling and pharmacovigilance activities, which are planned for the post-marketing period.   
Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure were consistently higher after administration of NG as compared to 
injected glucagon, by around 6 mmHg. The reason for this finding is not clear; local irritation might play a role, 
but this BP increase is not considered a concern since Baqsimi is not intended for chronic use. 
Elderly patients and patients with renal or hepatic impairment were largely excluded from the main clinical trials 
because induction of hypoglycaemia could pose a hazard for this population. These special patient groups are 
not excluded from NG treatment according to the current SmPC, and no dose adjustment is recommended.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials  have been included in the Summary 
of Product Characteristics. 
In order to minimise the potential risk of inappropriate use of the device (which might lead to loss of the drug 
dose by inadvertent priming of the single dose container), the Marketing Authorisation Holder must ensure that 
healthcare professionals and patients/carers who are expected to prescribe, supply or use the product have 
access to educational materials, i.e. and administration leaflet, instructional video and a demonstration kit that 
includes a trainer device.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Nasal administration of glucagon NG frequently leads to local side effects which appear more intense than the 
injection site reactions after IM/SC administration of an injectable glucagon. Moreover, adverse events were 
more commonly seen in adults than in children. The most commonly reported AEs were headache, nausea, 
vomiting, and “upper respiratory tract irritation.” Except for headache, the current product labelling for 
injectable glucagon provides the reported adverse effects due to intra nasal glucagon. 
To minimise a potential risk of inappropriate use of the device, routine and additional risk minimisation 
measures are recommended to minimise a potential risk of inappropriate use of the device (see section 2.7 Risk 
Management Plan).

Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
Based on the fact that this application concerns both a new formulation and a novel method of administration of 
glucagon, the CHMP is of the opinion that a separate entry in the EURD list for BAQSIMI is needed, as it cannot 
follow the already existing entry for glucagon. The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports 
for this medicinal product are set out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request 
the alignment of the new PSUR cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 24.07.2019. The new 
EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
In view of the important potential risk of inappropriate use of the device (see RMP above), other routine risk 
minimisation measures beyond the Product Information were introduced, i.e. instructions for proper use are 
highlighted on the device carton and tube container to state ‘Do not press the plunger prior to insertion as you 
will lose the dose’ and ‘Do not press plunger before insertion’, respectively. 
Furthermore, additional risk minimisation measures (administration leaflet, instructional video and a  
demonstration kit with a trainer device) will be made available. 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant 
show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of 
the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Severe hypoglycemia is one of the most significant complications of diabetes treatment, occurring more 
frequently in patients with profound endogenous insulin deficiency—type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) and 
advanced type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
Episodes of severe hypoglycemia are characterized by neurological impairment that, if left untreated, can lead 
to serious consequences, such as loss of consciousness, seizures, coma, adverse cardiovascular outcomes, and 
even death. Severe hypoglycemia requires the assistance from another person to actively administer 
carbohydrates, glucagon, or take other corrective actions (IHSG 2015).

3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Injectable glucagon is a safe and efficacious emergency treatment for severe hypoglycemia and, together with 
administration of carbohydrates, is currently the only treatment option for patients and their caregivers outside 
of the hospital or emergency medical setting. However, practical considerations, such as the multistep 
preparation of the solution for administration and injection by untrained users, have limited the use of injectable 
glucagon and can lead to delays in treatment and increased use of costly emergency medical services. 
Peptide hormones are typically administered via a parenteral route such as intravenous, intramuscular, or 
subcutaneous. Oral administration is not practical since they undergo digestion and inactivation in the 
gastrointestinal tract and significant first pass metabolism, resulting in significant loss of efficacy). To overcome 
the usability challenges of injectable therapy while preserving efficacy, intranasal administration of peptide 
hormones has been developed. Known examples of intranasal peptides include desmopressin, oxytocin, and 
calcitonin. This application is for the use  of a nasal glucagon (NG) for treatment of severe hypoglycaemia 
providing an administration of glucagon via a ready to use needle-free device, and could represent an 
improvement in the evolution of the treatment of severe hypoglycaemia outside of the hospital or emergency 
medical setting. . 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of nasal glucagon (NG) was characterised in healthy 
subjects (study IGBD) and in adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes (Study IGBA and study IGBG). 
As main evidence of efficacy in the adult population, two controlled clinical studies (IGBC, IGBI) were 
submitted. Effectiveness was investigated in a non-controlled actual-use study (B002).  
Studies IGBC and IGBI were single dose, multicenter, randomized, open-label, 2-treatment, 2 period crossover, 
non-inferiority studies. Efficacy in reversing insulin-induced hypoglycemia in patients with T1DM was assessed 
compared to injectable glucagon. The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients achieving 
treatment success, which was defined as either an increase in blood glucose to ≥70 mg/dl or an increase of ≥20 
mg/d from glucose nadir within 30 minutes after receiving study glucagon without receiving additional actions to 
increase the blood glucose level. Time to treatment success was investigated as an additional endpoint. Since 
there were relevant qualitative differences between the clinical trial drug product and commercial drug product, 
a clinical bridging study (IGBI) was conducted using NG commercial drug product, which mimicked the design of 
study IGBC. Symptoms of hypoglycemia were captured in studies IGBC and IGBI by using the Edinburgh 
Hypoglycemia Questionnaire. Patients were asked to rate the intensity of each symptom included in the 
questionnaire on a 1 =no symptoms to 7 =severe symptoms scale. 
The actual use study was a single-arm open-label study in adults with T1D. A single dose of NG was administered 
in case of moderate or severe hypoglycemia for up to 6 months. The endpoint was the proportion of 
hypoglycemic events in which patients awakened or returned to normal status within 30 min after NG 
administration. The purpose of this study was to evaluate effectiveness and safety of NG when administered by 
caregivers for treatment of severe or moderate hypoglycemia in adult patients with T1D. The caregiver’s 
perception on the use of NG was captured by an unvalidated questionnaire addressing usability issues.

As main evidence of efficacy in the pediatric population, two multicenter studies in patients with T1D using the 
clinical trial drug product were submitted. The pivotal study (IGBB) was a randomized study with the purpose 
to assess safety, tolerability, and PK and PD properties of NG. The exploratory efficacy analyses investigated the 
proportion of patients with treatment response defined as a rise ≥25 mg/dl above nadir by 30 minutes. 
The actual use study in children (B001) mimicked the design of study B002. The endpoint was the 
proportion of patients who achieved an increase in glucose ≥20 mg/dl from nadir within 30 min after 
administration of NG. Usability was assessed as in the adult actual use study. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In the adult pivotal study IGBC the proportions of patients in the NG 3 mg and IMG 1 mg treatment groups who 
achieved treatment success were 98.7% and 100%, respectively, in the primary analysis population (patients 
with T1D). The treatment difference in the proportions of patients achieving treatment success (IMG-NG) was 
1.3%, with the 1-sided upper 97.5% confidence limit of 4.0%, which is below the non-inferiority margin of 10%. 
Of the five patients with T2D included in the efficacy analysis, 100% achieved treatment success with NG and 
IMG. The sensitivity analysis conducted in patients with T1D with a glucose nadir of <50 mg/dl at both dosing 
visits (n=39 [52%]) also demonstrated non-inferiority to IMG in the proportion of patients achieving treatment 
success (100% treatment success with IMG, 97.4% treatment success with NG). 
These favourable effects observed in the pivotal study were confirmed with the commercial drug product in 
study IGBI (clinical bridging study). In this study, 100% of all patients in both treatment arms achieved 
treatment success.  
Patients in study IGBC had a mean time to treatment success of 16.2 minutes and 12.2 minutes in the NG and 
IMG treatment groups, respectively (study IGBI: 11.4 minutes and 9.9 minutes in the NG and IMG treatment 
groups, respectively; study IGBB: young children IMG 10.0 minutes, NG 10.8 minutes; children IMG 12.5 
minutes, NG 11.3 minutes; adolescents IMG 12.5 minutes, NG 14.2 min). Time to treatment success was 
slightly shorter with IMG across studies.  
In both studies (IGBC and IGBI) the rise in blood glucose was accompanied by an improvement in hypoglycemia 
symptoms (Edinburgh Hypoglycemia Questionnaire). In both studies and both treatment groups, a moderate 
decrease in mean total score was demonstrated at the 30 min time-point and symptoms continued to improve 
through 45 minutes. The perception of hypoglycaemic recovery was similar between the two treatment 
modalities.  
The favorable blood glucose restoring ability of NG was confirmed in children from 4 to 18 years of age: in the 
pivotal pediatric study IGBB 100% of patients with T1D achieved an increase in glucose of ≥25 mg/dl within 30 
minutes of NG administration in all age cohorts in both treatment arms.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/602404/2019 
Page 107/116 
 
 
 
   
  
 
 
 
Two uncontrolled actual use studies in adults and children (B002 and B001) demonstrated real-world 
effectiveness and good acceptability by caregivers. Among adult patients with T1D who used NG to treat 
moderate or severe (n=12) hypoglycemic events, patients awoke, ceased convulsions, or returned to normal 
status within 30 minutes for 96.2% of hypoglycemic events. In the pediatric study, all patients returned from 
moderate hypoglycemia (no severe hypoglycemia was reported) to normal status within 30 minutes. In these 
studies, the caregiver successfully delivered NG in a stressful setting, and no caregiver called for external 
professional emergency medical assistance. In addition, for most of the hypoglycemic events in both actual use 
studies, caregivers reported (un-validated questionnaire) that it was easy to administer NG compared to 
injectable glucagon (93.9% pediatric study, 80.5% adult study) and that they were satisfied with the use of NG. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The patient populations of the NG clinical studies were generally homogenous and largely composed of white, 
non-elderly adult (<65 years) and pediatric patients from the US, Canada, and Germany.  Therefore, one could 
argue that there is a lack of diversity in the study population. However, there is no reason to assume that 
glucagon would not work or would work differently in older patients or in patients of different ethnic background. 
The fact that elderly patients are  insufficiently represented in the clinical studies has been reflected in the 
product information. This is considered a limitation of the clinical development since older patients are at 
increased risk of hypoglycemia since they tend to be frail and on polypharmacy . In the proposed product 
information a warning with respect to age has been added. 
The studied patient population were mainly T1DM  patients and the number of T2DM patients that received NG 
was limited (n=44). Also the number of pediatric patients (4-18 years) included in the trials was limited 
(n=70).However, this is not of concern for efficacy since the mechanism of action of glucacon is the same in 
T1DM and T2DM patients and in adult and paediatric patients with diabetes and the same dose will be used 
across the age spectrum. 
The proposed use of nasal glucagon is for treatment of severe hypoglycaemia but the controlled studies did not 
induce severe hypoglycaemia in study subjects. This is acceptable because of ethical considerations and 
because non-inferior efficacy of NG was shown compared to injectable glucagon, which is also licensed for 
treatment of severe hypoglycaemia. 
A routine GCP inspection of the paediatric study IGBB yielded critical findings related to sample processing and 
data handling. The data recording system provided by the sponsor was not GCP compliant. However, this issue 
could be addressed during the procedure as part of the information stored in the eCFRs could be verified by 
independent recordings at the individual study sites. Data from about 60% of the visits could be rescued to a 
large extent (≥90% of data verified). Re-analyses of these data showed consistencv with the complete dataset. 
The critical findings in the GCP inspection of Study IGBB with respect to source data handling may also apply for 
the pivotal adult study IGBC because data handling was similar. PK data cannot be relied upon due to inadequate 
sample processing. PD data were affected to a lesser extent. However, the Applicant has provided convincing 
evidence that the newer studies, using the commercial Baqsimi product (IGBI), are sufficient to support efficacy 
of Baqsimi in adults. Therefore, study IGBI is considered pivotal for showing efficacy in adults. 
Time from glucagon administration to treatment success was slightly shorter (1 to 4 minutes) with injectable 
glucagon across studies. However, in the real-world setting, time starts at the caregiver`s decision to administer 
glucagon. Since injectable glucagon requires a multistep preparation, one can safely assume that the small 
differences are without relevance in clinical practice. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/602404/2019 
Page 108/116 
 
 
 
   
  
 
PK-results with NG are heterogeneous and a drift of PK-values was observed during the development program 
which could be attributed to the change in drug product. Lower glucagon exposure mainly appeared in early 
clinical studies with the clinical trial drug product (IGBA, IGBE). In contrast, Cmax increased markedly with the 
commercial formulation (IGBI and IGBJ) compared to the older formulation used in the pivotal studies IGBC 
(adult) and IGBB (paediatric). Due to critical GCP findings in study IGBB, only PD results of this study are 
considered reliable. However, it is concluded that PK data are only of supportive value to the B/R analysis.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The main adverse effects reported were ocular irritation (lacrimation, pruritus), nausea, vomiting, headache and 
upper respiratory tract symptoms. The safety profile of NG includes well-known effects of glucagon treatment 
and no important identified risks have been observed in the NG program. Adverse effects were transient and 
non-serious in nature.   
However, next to the already well known adverse events as mentioned in the SmPC of IMG, in NG treated 
patients was headache a common adverse events. Although, this effect was transient in both adults and 
children, it is not clear if there is a relation between the severity of the hypoglycemia or if it is purely related with 
the intra nasal admission of the investigated drug.  
It is noticed that the adverse events are not different between children and adults, although adverse events are 
less reported in children than in adults. It is not excluded that children were not able to answer the questions 
adequately in the used questionnaires. The applicant could not exclude under-reporting of AEs in children and 
therefore suggested modifying the labelling in the SmPC accordingly. This approach is accepted. 
Overall, the safety profile of NG is consistent with the currently approved injectable glucagon products, with the 
exception of additional effects related to its nasal route of administration.  The most commonly reported AEs 
were headache, nausea, vomiting, and “upper respiratory tract irritation.” Except for headache, the current 
product labelling for injectable glucagon provides the reported adverse effects due to intra nasal glucagon. 
Adverse events were more commonly seen in adults than in children. 
Overall, the safety data presented in this dossier demonstrate that NG is safe for the treatment of severe 
hypoglycemia in adult and pediatric patients.  However, the commercial formulation may have a markedly 
increased Cmax compared to the clinical trial formulation.  
To minimise a potential risk of inappropriate use of the single dose container, risk minimisation measures will be 
implemented. These include a demonstration kit with a training device, an administration leaflet and an 
instructional video.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety database for NG was sufficient to adequately characterize the safety profile of NG in the elderly adult 
(mostly <65 years) and pediatric patients (all >4 years) with diabetes given the intended use of NG and the 
history of safe use with the currently approved injectable glucagon products.  However, only Caucasian patients 
were included in the safety database. Moreover, patients who received 3mg NG are only a part of the 
investigated patient group. Patients with T2DM were underrepresented in the trials, although they represent the 
highest diabetes population in general daily practice. On the other hand, patients with T1DM generally carry a 
higher risk for hypoglycaemia.  No difference in adverse events in both T1DM and T2DM is expected.   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/602404/2019 
Page 109/116 
 
 
 
   
  
 
The safety database  is considered sufficient in size , except for some subgroups of patients such as patients >65 
years, children and non-white patients. However, the safety profile can be extrapolated to these patient 
populations also. 
Children down to four years of age are intended to receive the same dose of Baqsimi as adults (3 mg). Safety 
and tolerability of this dose (older formulation) were investigated in the paediatric study IGBB, albeit in a rather 
low number of subjects. Adult studies revealed that the commercial Baqsimi preparation may lead to markedly 
higher Cmax than the preparation used in most studies including IGBB. The applicant provided a comprehensive 
analysis which suggests that no harm is expected from transiently high plasma levels of glucagon when using 
the adult dose in children.  
The possibility to generalize to clinical practice is acceptable, however  
-Information of NG in breastfeeding patients is lacking but because glucagon is not absorbed in the 
gastrointestinal tract, this is not a problem even if glucagon is excreted in the milk. 
-There is no subgroup analysis of AE’s by gender, race, and ethnicity. However, no difference in safety profile is 
expected. 
-No safety data have been generated for special populations (patients with liver of renal impairment), or 
patients with hypertension. However, glucagon is intended to be administered as a single dose in an emergency 
situation. Therefore, lack of such data is considered acceptable. 
As with all development programs, the safety evaluation for NG could not detect very rare adverse effects, 
adverse effects with long latency, or adverse effects caused by prolonged or cumulative exposure. It is accepted 
that these limitations are less meaningful for NG because the treatment indication is for acute potentially 
life-saving episodic use and not for chronic administration. However, several patients received several 
administrations of NG during a short time period.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Severe hypoglycaemia is an emergency situation. Nasal glucagon was shown to restore blood glucose levels in 
hypoglycemic adult and paediatric subjects to a similar extent and within a similar time frame as injectable 
glucagon. Further important favourable effects are the comparability in terms of time to treatment success with 
IMG, and with respect of improvement of hypoglycemic symptom perception. Two uncontrolled actual use 
studies in adults and children demonstrated real-world effectiveness and good acceptability by caregivers, which 
is clearly beneficial in light of the unmet medical need for a ready-to-use device. 
Adverse events frequently occurred after administration of Baqsimi, consisting of GI effects and local symptoms 
affecting nose, eyes, throat and head in general. GI effects were also observed with injected glucagon so that 
they do not contribute to B/R considerations of Baqsimi when compared to available IM glucagon kits. The local 
symptoms were occasionally reported as severe and were in general more frequent than injection site reactions 
following IM glucagon. However, local symptoms were not regarded serious . Local symptoms are not 
considered an important risk in the light of the life-threatening situation in which Baqsimi is used. Under these 
circumstances, the need for reliable administration (in terms of easy delivery) outweighs the frequently 
observed local discomfort. 
In order to minimise the potential risk of inappropriate use of the device (which might lead to loss of the drug 
dose by inadvertent priming of the single dose container), the Marketing Authorisation Holder must ensure that 
healthcare professionals and patients/carers who are expected to prescribe, supply or use the product have 
access to educational materials, i.e. and administration leaflet, instructional video and a demonstration kit that 
includes a trainer device.Overall, the safety profile of NG is consistent with the currently approved injectable 
glucagon products, with the exception of additional effects related to its nasal route of administration and is 
acceptable.   
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Severe hypoglycaemia is a serious acute complication of diabetes treatment.  
In the pivotal controlled studies, NG 3 mg produced clinically relevant increases in blood-glucose in response to 
insulin-induced hypoglycaemia, showing comparable success rates to IMG in paediatric patients aged 4-18 and 
adults. These findings are supported by actual-use studies, which demonstrated effectiveness of NG in the 
treatment of moderate to severe hypoglycaemia. These findings underscore the benefit of nasal glucagon. The 
safety profile of NG is consistent with the currently approved injectable glucagon products, with the exception of 
additional effects related to its nasal route of administration. Additional risk minimisation measures  will be 
implemented (educational materials) to minimise a potential risk of inappropriate use of the device.  
In summary, NG 3 mg has the potential to serve as a valuable asset in the treatment of hypoglycaemia in adults 
and children with the potential advantage of an easy delivery of glucagon in an emergency situation.

Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to launch of Baqsimi (glucagon), for the treatment of severe hypoglycaemia in adults, adolescents, and 
children aged 4 years and over with diabetes mellitus, in each EU Member State, the Marketing Authorisation 
Holder (MAH) must agree on the content and format of the educational materials, including communication 
media, distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent Authority.  
The educational materials are aimed at providing guidance on how to minimise the important potential risk in the 
RMP of inappropriate use of the device leading to loss of drug benefit. 
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where Baqsimi is marketed, all healthcare professionals and 
patients/carers who are expected to prescribe, supply or use the product have access to the following: 
•  Administration leaflet;  
• 
Instructional video; 
•  Demonstration kit that includes a trainer device with an administration leaflet unique to the trainer 
device. 
The administration leaflet should contain the following key elements: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Patients should receive the administration leaflet from their healthcare professionals upon initial 
Baqsimi prescription and after training.  
The demonstration kit should include a leaflet unique to the trainer device. 
It is important not to prime the single-dose container in advance, not to remove the shrink wrapping or 
to remove the single-dose container from the tube in advance and to ensure that the patient 
understands that while the trainer device used during demonstration can be reset/reused, each Baqsimi 
single-dose container can only be used once. 
The PL/IFU should be referenced for more detailed information regarding administration and handling of 
Baqsimi. 
Patients can use the leaflet to teach those around them how to correctly handle and administer Baqsimi.  
The leaflet should contain a URL and, where required, a password to a website where patients can access 
the instructional video.     
The instructional video should contain the following key elements: 
• 
To reinforce the correct Baqsimi handling and administration, step-by-step instructions on the 
appropriate use of Baqsimi should be provided.  
The demonstration kit that includes a trainer device should contain the following key elements: 
• 
The demonstration kit consists of a trainer device, which is a non-drug containing device, and a box with 
instructions on how to use Baqsimi.

•  An administration leaflet unique to the trainer device should be included within the demonstration kit 
that includes the trainer device. 
• 
• 
• 
The trainer device should be used by healthcare professionals who prescribe and supply Baqsimi to 
educate patients and/or caregivers.  
In addition to instructions for correct handling and administration, the demonstration kit should contain 
key points that healthcare professionals who prescribe and supply Baqsimi should emphasise when 
training patients and/or caregivers on Baqsimi (importance of not priming the single-dose container in 
advance, not removing the shrink wrapping or removing the single-dose container from the tube in 
advance and ensuring that the patient understands that while the trainer device used during 
demonstration can be reset/reused, each Baqsimi single-dose container can only be used once). 
The trainer device should not be inserted into a patient’s nostril when demonstrating (that is, to observe 
prudent hygiene measures). 
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0184/2015 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

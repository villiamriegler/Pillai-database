A post-hoc analysis of study CAPiTA was performed to 
efficacy information based on results from a public 
health analysis and publication of data from the 
CAPiTA (Community-Acquired Pneumonia 
Immunization Trial in Adults), a double-blind, 
randomized, placebo-controlled efficacy trial of 13-
valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance

(IRR) and number needed to vaccinate (NNV) against 
clinical Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP); defined as 
CAP based on clinical findings regardless of radiologic 
infiltrate or etiologic confirmation. The post-hoc analysis 
study shows that the impact of this vaccine remains 
positive in  helping to prevent clinical CAP. The magnitude 
of overall VE 95% CI of 8.1 (-0.6, 16.1) against clinical CAP 
was statistically significant. The NNV reflects that at least

previously vaccinated with a pneumococcal vaccine 
received 3 doses of Prevenar 13. After the first dose, 
Prevenar 13 elicited antibody levels, measured by both IgG 
GMCs and OPA GMTs that were statistically significantly 
higher when compared to levels prior to vaccination. After 
the second and third dose of Prevenar 13, immune 
responses were similar or higher than those after the first 
dose.

of Prevenar 13 with an interval of at least 1 month between 
doses. Prevenar 13 elicited increased antibody levels after 
each dose. Immune responses after the fourth dose of 
Prevenar 13 were significantly increased for all serotypes 
compared with the third dose.  
In study 6096A1-3014 (B1851013), 2 doses of Prevenar 13

Study B1851047 assessed the impact of prophylactic 
information on the concomitant use of Prevenar 13

immunogenicity and safety of 13vPnC and Infanrix hexa in 
infants and toddlers. 
The findings from this study support the hypothesis that 
use of antipyretic agents as a prophylactic measure to 
prevent fever associated with vaccination may interfere 
with immune responses to vaccine antigens, especially 
Page 31/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
when given at the time of vaccination. These effects vary 
depending on the prophylactic agent and the vaccine. 
Paracetamol appears to impact the response to 
pneumococcal antigens but not to any antigen included in 
Infanrix hexa, which was given concomitantly in this study, 
and ibuprofen appears to impact the response to pertussis 
FHA and tetanus antigens but not to any pneumococcal 
antigen. The majority of subjects in all prophylaxis groups 
achieved immune responses that are likely to be adequate 
to prevent disease. Furthermore, these effects are 
observed only following the infant series and not following 
the toddler dose, suggesting that despite this early 
reduction in immune response, adequate priming is 
achieved and the ability to mount a robust toddler response 
is preserved. The use of antipyretics on the day of 
vaccination seems to have the most effect on the immune 
response. The clinical significance of these findings is not 
known. The CHMP considered the proposed text in section 
4.5 regarding the interaction adequate and that the 
changes introduced do not affect the positive risk/benefit 
balance of the product.

The MAH has submitted a type II to revise the frequency of 
frequencies of adverse reactions with the Company 
core data sheet (CDS), upon the conduct of a safety 
review. The package leaflet is updated in accordance. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
adverse reactions that are currently labelled in 4.8 of the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (convulsions, rash, 
urticaria, vomiting, and diarrhoea). The difference resulted 
from inclusion of all adverse events in the estimations of 
frequency for the Reference Safety Information and only 
those adverse events reported as vaccine-related in the 
estimations of frequency were included in the SmPC. The 
CHMP considered appropriate to align the SmPC with the 
Company RSI to provide health care providers and patients 
with the most update and relevant safety information. 
Therefore the CHMP endorsed.

of 13vPnC in populations with specific conditions 
associated with increased risk of pneumococcal 
disease. The PL was updated accordingly. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
after vaccination in pre-term infants as well as 
immunosuppressed subjects such as sickle cell disease 
patients and HIV infected subjects.  
The preterm infants generally had lower responses than the 
full term infants, but the responses were considered 
adequate to provide a significant benefit for these children.  
The immune responses in SCD patients were lower than 
what has been reported in studies of healthy subjects in the 
same age group, although no formal comparison across 
studies can be performed. However, there appears to be a 
clear benefit also in this group for vaccination with 
Prevenar 13.  
Likewise, the responses in HIV infected subjects were lower 
than reported from non-HIV infected adults, but still 
represent a benefit for this group of patients. There was no 
indication of hyporesponsiveness following repeated 
vaccinations, as similar immune responses were seen after 
each vaccination.  
In view of safety in these populations, children and 
adolescents with sickle cell disease have similar frequencies 
of adverse reactions, except that headaches, vomiting, 
diarrhoea, pyrexia, fatigue, arthralgia, and myalgia were 
very common. Adults with HIV infection previously 
vaccinated with the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide 
vaccine, have similar frequencies of adverse reactions, 
except that vomiting was very common and nausea 
common. 
The CHMP considered the benefit of vaccinating the above 
risk groups was demonstrated, and the proposed update of 
the relevant sections of the Product Information to include 
information on these studies was endorsed.

3010, together with post-marketing surveillance data from 
France (Cohen et al, ACTIV study) and the United States 
(Desai et al, Atlanta study) were submitted in support of 
this application. The overall results presented indicate that 
vaccination with Prevenar 13 leads to decreased 
nasopharyngeal carriage of the 6 additional vaccine 
serotypes compared to Prevenar. The studies compared 
carriage rates after vaccination with Prevenar 13 and 
Page 40/58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
NO new additional data are submitted by the MAH 
Prevenar, and therefore carriage reductions could be 
demonstrated for the 6 additional serotypes. The reduction 
was mainly driven by a reduction in serotype 19A, and to 
some extent in serotype 6A/6C. The CHMP endorsed the 
inclusion of these data in section 5.1 of the SmPC.

008, 6096A1-3021 and 6096A1-3012 were submitted to 
support the recommendation for catch-up vaccination in 
children aged over 12 months who are considered 
completely immunized with Prevenar a 7–valent 
pneumococcal vaccine (7vPnC). In these studies, subjects 
received 1 or 2 doses of Prevenar 13, a 13-valent 
pneumococcal vaccine (13vPnC) administered after 1, 2, 3, 
or 4 doses of 7vPnC in infants and young children ranging 
in age, across the 4 studies, from 2 months to less than 5 
years. The additional benefit of a second catch-up dose of 
Prevenar 13 in children fully vaccinated with Prevenar was 
considered small and the adverse reactions of an additional 
dose are generally expected to be mild and transient. The

The MAH submitted the final study report evaluating the 
a statement on subcutaneous administration based 
on data from clinical study 6096A1-3003-JA. The 
MAH takes also the opportunity to update the SmPC 
to comply with the latest QRD template and to 
update the details of the local representatives. 
Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of a 13-valent 
Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Healthy Infants in 
Japan. It should be noted that in Japan, subcutaneous (SC) 
administration is the standard route for childhood 
vaccination, although adults are vaccinated by the 
intramuscular (IM) route. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
Although the study did not directly compare subcutaneous 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
and intramuscular administration, the immune response 
and safety profile of Prevenar 13 given subcutaneously 
were generally similar to those observed in other clinical 
studies in which Prevenar 13 was given intramuscularly. In 
this study 185 healthy children received 4 doses of 
Prevenar 13 at 2, 4, 6 and 12-15 months of age.  
This information can be useful for prescribers when

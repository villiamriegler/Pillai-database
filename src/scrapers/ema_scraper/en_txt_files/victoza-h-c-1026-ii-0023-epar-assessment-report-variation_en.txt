2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Victoza (liraglutide) is a once-daily human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue. Compared to 
human GLP-1, liraglutide has a C16 fatty (palmitic) acid chain attached at position 26 (lysine) of the 
peptide, and has a lysine at position 34 replaced by an arginine. When administered subcutaneously 
(s.c.), these structural modifications result in pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of the compound suitable 
for once daily administration. Mode of action trials in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have 
demonstrated glucose lowering, increased insulin secretion, restored beta-cell responsiveness to 
increasing glucose concentrations and delayed gastric emptying after a single s.c. dose of liraglutide. 
EU approval for Victoza was obtained on 30 June 2009 for combination therapy with metformin, 
sulphonylureas (SUs), metformin and an SU or metformin and a thiazolidinedione (TZD), when the single 
or double agents did not result in adequate glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
The application concerns a Type 2 variation for Victoza (Liraglutide). The MAH seeks to extend the 
indication in combination with basal insulin and to simplify the Victoza indication wording. 
2.2.  Clinical Pharmacology aspects 
2.2.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
The IDegLira clinical pharmacology programme assessed to what extent IDeg and liraglutide affect each 
other’s pharmacokinetic profile in the IDegLira fixed ratio combination product. This was investigated in 
Trial NN9068-3632, a single-dose multi-period cross-over trial in healthy men, comparing IDegLira with 
the monocomponents IDeg and Lira. This trial was included in the MAA for IDeg, and also in the MAA for 
IDegLira. The dose tested was 17U/0.6mg, both as combination and as individual agents. The dose was 
based on the recommended starting dose of monocomponent Lira. The trial also included a period when 
IDeg and Lira were administered together as monocomponent formulations. Each subject was dosed on 4 
occasions (IDegLira, IDeg, liraglutide and separate simultaneous administration of IDeg and liraglutide in 
randomized order) with 7-15 days wash-out in between. All doses were administered sc in the thigh. A 24 
hour euglycaemic clamp was applied, and blood sampling for pharmacokinetic assessment was performed 
for 72 hours for liraglutide and 96 hours for IDeg. 
2.2.2.  Results 
The bioavailability of IDeg was very similar when administered alone or in the combination, with a 
relative bioavailability of 103% (post-hoc 90% CI 0.99-1.07) and the Cmax was somewhat higher after 
administering the combination, Cmax ratio of 1.12 (0.99-1.27). The relative bioavailability (AUC0-∞,IDeg,SD) 
for IDeg administered as part of IDegLira versus IDeg administered concomitantly with liraglutide was 
0.98 [0.95 ; 1.02]90% CI, and the ratio of Cmax,IDeg,SD was 1.04 [0.92 ; 1.18]90% CI.  
Liraglutide, on the other hand, showed a somewhat lower bioavailability when given in the combination, 
with an AUC ratio of 0.89 (post-hoc 90% CI 0.82-0.96), and a lower Cmax (ratio 0.77, 90% CI 0.68-0.87). 
The relative bioavailability (ratio of AUC0-∞,lira,SD) for liraglutide administered as part of IDegLira versus 
liraglutide administered concomitantly with IDeg was 0.89 [0.83 ; 0.97)]90% CI, and the ratio of Cmax,lira,SD 
was 0.74 [0.66 ; 0.84]90% CI, indicating an 11% lower AUC and a 26% reduction in Cmax. These observed 
Assessment report

Page 3/30 
 
  
  
differences between the pharmacokinetics of IDegLira and liraglutide are not considered to impact the 
validity of the supportive evidence for combined use of IDeg and liraglutide obtained with IDegLira. 
2.2.3.  Discussion 
As the interaction study was already assessed during other procedures, no full assessment was conducted 
in this procedure. The results of the submitted study show that the pharmacokinetics of IDeg are not 
influenced by concomitant administration of Lira alone or in any combination with IDeg. The 90% 
confidence intervals are within the acceptance criteria for bioequivalence. 
With respect to the pharmacokinetics of Lira, the extent of absorption is not affected but the rate of 
absorption after administration of the combination product with IDeg is statistically significant decreased.  
However, this lower Cmax of 26% is considered not clinical relevant. 
2.3.  Clinical Efficacy aspects  
2.3.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
In support of the application, four clinical trials were submitted (Table 1): Trial 3948 from the IDeg phase 
3b programme, Trials 3697 and 3912 from the IDegLira phase 3a programme, and Trial 1842 from the 
liraglutide phase 3b programme. In these trials, IDeg and liraglutide were administered either as separate 
injections of the two individual drugs or as one injection of the fixed ratio combination product IDegLira in 
subjects with T2DM inadequately controlled on OADs, basal insulin in combination with OADs, or a GLP-1 
receptor agonist in combination with OADs. Trial 3697 and 3912 were submitted with the MAA for 
IDegLira; trial 3948 was also submitted with the MAA for IDegLira, but as supportive study; trial 1842 
was submitted in Type 2 variations for liraglutide and in for insulin detemir and has been assessed in 
those procedures.  
The MAH considers trial 3948 as pivotal, while the other studies are seen as supportive.

2.3.2.  Main study 
Study 3948 
This trial was a 26-week randomised, controlled, open-label, multicentre, multinational, parallel, treat-to-
target trial comparing the efficacy and safety of adding liraglutide versus addition of IAsp to IDeg OD + 
metformin. Eligible subjects were patients with type 2 diabetes who had completed approximately 104 
weeks of treatment with IDeg + metformin in NN1250-3579 and the extension trial, NN1250-3643, with 
an end of treatment HbA1c ≥7.0%, thus qualifying for treatment intensification.  Subjects were 
randomised 1:1 to add liraglutide once daily or IAsp with the largest meal as intensification of current 
treatment with IDeg OD + metformin. 
A third treatment arm consisted of non-randomised subjects who completed NN1250-3643 and achieved 
the glycaemic target of HbA1c <7.0% at end of treatment. These subjects continued treatment with IDeg 
OD + metformin in order to further evaluate the long-term sustainability of glycaemic control. No 
comparisons were made between the non-randomised and the randomised treatment arms. 
At randomisation, subjects in the IDeg + IAsp group were to start IAsp at 4U once daily with the largest 
meal and continue the IDeg dose they received prior to randomisation. In the IDeg + Lira group, subjects 
were to reduce their IDeg dose by 20% at randomisation and maintain this dose until Visit 8. Subjects in 
the IDeg + Lira arm started liraglutide at 0.6 mg/day and increased to 1.2 mg/day after one week. At 
Visit 7, liraglutide was to be increased to 1.8 mg/day if warranted based on the mean of three pre-
breakfast SMPG values ≥ 5 mmol/L (90 mg/dL) measured just prior to Visit 7. In the subsequent 26 
weeks of treatment, the subject’s insulin dose was titrated once weekly based on self-measured plasma 
glucose (SMPG) to ensure the enforced titration towards a predefined glycaemic target.

The primary objective of the study was to compare the efficacy of adding liraglutide versus adding IAsp to 
the largest meal on top of IDeg (OD) + metformin in controlling glycaemia. The secondary objective was 
to compare the safety of adding liraglutide versus adding IAsp to the largest meal on top of IDeg OD + 
metformin. 
The objective of the non-randomised arm was to evaluate the durability of IDeg to maintain glycaemic 
control over an additional 26 weeks in subjects who achieved the target HbA1c < 7% after 104 weeks of 
treatment with IDeg + metformin in NN1250-3579 and the extension trial, NN1250-3643. 
Primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c after 26 weeks of treatment using an 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) method with treatment, sex and region as fixed factors and age and 
baseline HbA1c as covariates. Secondary endpoints included HbA1c responders (HbA1c < 7%), 
responders without hypoglycaemia, responders without hypoglycaemia and  weight gain, FPG, 9-point 
profile (SMPG), IDeg dose, body weight. 
2.3.3.  Supportive studies 
For this Application three trials were submitted as supportive trials: trial 3697, 3912 and 1842. As stated 
above, trials 3697 and 3912 were submitted with the MAA for IDegLira. Both trials investigated the 
efficacy and safety of IDegLira. Trial 3697 was performed in insulin-naive subjects, while trial 3912 
included patients failing on insulin+OADs. Therefore, study 3912 is considered more relevant for showing 
efficacy than trial 3697. 
Trial 1842 was submitted in type 2 variation procedures for liraglutide and insulin detemir and has been 
assessed in those procedures. At that time, for addition of liraglutide to ongoing insulin therapy this study 
was considered inappropriate, as the trial investigated the effects of addition of insulin to ongoing 
liraglutide treatment. For the current Application the study has no value for efficacy but may be 
supportive for safety. It is mentioned briefly in this section. 
Methods 
Trial 3697 
Trial 3697 was a randomised, controlled, parallel three-arm, multicentre, multinational treat-to-target 
trial with a 26-week main phase, which was followed by a 26-week extension phase to provide evidence 
of persistence of efficacy and safety during long-term exposure. The trial included subjects with type 2 
diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin or metformin + pioglitazone, defined as HbA1c level of 
7.0−10.0% (both inclusive). Subjects continued on their pre-trial OAD regimen throughout the duration 
of the trial. Primary objective was to confirm the efficacy of IDegLira in controlling glycaemia in subjects 
with type 2 diabetes. This was done by determining if the effect (change in HbA1c) of IDegLira was non-
inferior to that of IDeg and superior to that of liraglutide after 26 weeks of treatment. 
Trial 3912 
Trial 3912 was a randomised, controlled, double-blind, parallel two-arm, multicentre, multinational, treat-
to-target trial of 26 weeks duration. The trial included patients inadequately controlled on 20-40 
units/day of basal insulin and 1-2 OADs (metformin, or metformin and sulfonylurea/glinides), defined as 
HbA1c of 7.5–10.0% (both inclusive). Primary objective was to confirm superiority of IDegLira vs. IDeg in 
controlling glycaemia in subjects with type 2 diabetes. The maximum insulin dose in the IDeg treatment 
arm was 50 units (i.e., equivalent to the insulin dose administered with the proposed maximum dose of 
IDegLira) in order to specifically assess the contribution of the liraglutide component to glycaemic control 
with IDegLira.

2.3.4.  Results 
Main study 3948 
Participant flow 
Of the 659 subjects who completed NN1250-3643, 413 patients were enrolled in/ randomised in NN1250-
3948. A total of 88 patients were randomised to the IDeg + Liraglutide arm and 89 patients were 
randomised to the IDeg + IAsp arm. The remaining 236 patients were enrolled in the non-randomised 
arm. About 85 % of the patients completed the randomised part of the study. 
Baseline data 
Demographics, baseline and diabetes characteristics were generally similar between the treatment groups 
(Table 2). However, there was a slight imbalance in sex between treatment groups (more females in the 
IDeg + IAsp group). Most subjects were White (91%). Mean age was 61 years, mean HbA1c 7.7%, mean 
BMI 32.2 kg/m2. Duration of treatment was 12.4 years.

Endpoints 
The estimated mean reduction in HbA1c during the trial was −0.73 %-points with IDeg + Lira and −0.40 
%- points with IDeg + IAsp, with a statistically significant estimated mean difference in favour of IDeg + 
Lira of −0.32 %−points [−0.53; −0.12]95%CI. After 26 weeks of treatment, the observed mean (SD) 
HbA1c was 7.0 (0.8) % with IDeg + Lira and 7.3 (0.8) % with IDeg + IAsp. 
Secondary endpoints were in line with these results. Proportion of responders was larger for the IDeg + 
Lira group (58.0% vs 44.9%) and also the proportion of responders without hypoglycaemia was in favour 
of IDeg + Lira (54% vs 19%). In addition IDeg + Lira was accompanied with a decrease in body weight

Supportive studies 
In trial 3697, withdrawal rates were generally low, although slightly higher in the liraglutide treated 
group. In this group more patients withdrew due to AEs. Baseline demographic characteristics were well 
balanced between groups as were the baseline diabetes characteristics. Mean diabetes duration was 
relatively short as could be expected in an insulin naïve group of patients with T2DM, but the range was 
very wide. All patients were on metformin treatment at inclusion and about 17 % were on concomitant 
pioglitazone treatment. 
In trial 3912, withdrawal rates were balanced between groups as was the reasons for withdrawal. 
Baseline demographic characteristics were well balanced between groups as were the baseline diabetes 
characteristics. Mean diabetes duration was rather long as could be expected in an insulin treated group 
of patients with T2DM, but the range was very wide. About 50 % of patients were on dual OAD treatment 
at inclusion. 
Key efficacy results from trial 3697 and 3912 are shown in Table 4 and results for hypoglycaemia in

In both trials in the IDegLira group HbA1c decreased by 1.90% (from baseline HbA1c of 8.3 and 8.7%).  
IDegLira was superior to IDeg and Lira therapy. Results were supported by effects on FPG and prandial 
increments (both reduced). For the pre-defined glycaemic targets of HbA1c <7% and ≤6.5%, the 
proportion of IDegLira-treated subjects reaching targets were 80% and 70% (trial 3697), and 60% and 
45% (trial 3912). 
The results of the extension phase of trial 3697 show that the improvement in overall glycaemic control 
with IDegLira relative to comparators was maintained. Positive or neutral effects on body weight were 
also seen. 
Hypoglycaemia was evaluated as an integrated part of efficacy and was a confirmatory secondary 
endpoint of trial 3697. In trial 3697 IDegLira had a lower risk of hypoglycaemia relative to IDeg. The risk 
relative to liraglutide was higher; however glycaemic control with liraglutide was less tight. 
In trial 3912, hypoglycaemia rates were similar between IDegLira and IDeg. However, there was a 
greater improvement of HbA1c with IDegLira compared to IDeg.  
Study 1842 
Study 1842 was performed in T2DM patients to investigate the efficacy and safety of adding basal insulin 
detemir to the combination therapy liraglutide 1.8 mg+metformin. The purpose of the trial was to 
determine whether the effect of insulin detemir in combination with liraglutide 1.8 mg and metformin was 
superior to that of liraglutide 1.8 mg and metformin alone. patients inadequately controlled by Metformin 
(≥1500 mg daily) or Metformin + low dose SU (≤ half maximum dose) were switched to Metformin (same 
dose) + Liraglutide 1.8 mg daily. Subjects not adequately controlled after 12 weeks were randomised to 
receive insulin detemir as add-on to Metformin + Liraglutide or continued on Metformin + Liraglutide. 
Addition of insulin to liraglutide + metformin demonstrated a favourable, clinically relevant effect on the 
blood glucose control in terms of HbA1c reduction. The reduction in HbA1c in the triple therapy group at 
week 26 was (LS mean changes) -0.51%, vs. +0.02% in the metformin + liraglutide group (difference -
0.52 [CI: -0.68; -0.36]). The estimated proportions of subjects achieving HbA1c both <7% and ≤6.5% 
were significantly greater with insulin detemir + liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin (44% and 19%) 
compared to liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin (20% and 7%). Improvements in other endpoints of glucose 
control were observed, including mean change in FPG and changes in post-prandial glucose levels. 
Limitation of the study was that it only gives information about the efficacy and safety of insulin detemir 
when added to metformin + liraglutide. A treatment arm of insulin detemir + metformin was missing in 
Study 1842. Therefore, the impact of liraglutide itself in this triple therapy was not known. Triple therapy 
might have an advantage over combination treatment with metformin and insulin alone in terms of lower 
insulin dosage, fewer hypoglycaemic episodes and less weight gain, while achieving the same level of 
glucose control. However, this was not studied in this trial.

2.3.5.  Discussion 
In support of this application, the MAH has submitted four clinical trials: one pivotal (study 3948), and 
three supportive trials (3697, 3912 and 1842). Trial 3697 and 3912 were submitted as main studies 
with the MAA for IDegLira; trial 3948 was also submitted with the MAA for IDegLira, but as supportive 
study; trial 1842 was submitted in type 2 variation procedures for liraglutide and for insulin detemir 
and was assessed in those procedures. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The main clinical study (3948) was a 26-week randomised, controlled, open-label, treat-to-target 
trial comparing the efficacy and safety of adding liraglutide versus addition of IAsp with the largest 
meal to IDEG + metformin.  Eligible subjects were patients with type 2 diabetes who had completed 
approximately 104 weeks of treatment with IDeg + metformin in NN1250-3579 and the extension trial, 
NN1250-3643, with an end of treatment HbA1c ≥7.0%, thus qualifying for treatment intensification.  
Subjects were randomised 1:1 to add liraglutide once daily or IAsp with the largest meal to their 
current treatment with IDeg OD + metformin. The population of this study is a selected population who 
participated in trial 3579 for 52 weeks and in the extension trial 3643 for 52 weeks, before inclusion in 
this trial and as such they might not be as representative for the real clinical setting. In addition, as 
these patients are still qualifying for intensification of therapy, it is unlikely that IAsp administered 
once daily with the main meal will induce optimal glycaemic control. It can be expected that these 
subjects will need multiple daily injections. 
In total 413 patients were enrolled/randomised of whom 88 received IDeg + Liraglutide and 89 IDeg + 
IAsp. The remaining 236 patients were enrolled in a non-randomised arm, the objective of which does 
not contribute to this application. Therefore, the sample size for this application is considered limited. 
From the supportive studies, trial 3912 is considered the most representative for this application, as it 
was conducted in subjects failing on basal insulin + OADs. The Applicant considers this study as 
supportive because IDegLira was used and not the separate components. It was a 26-weeks 
randomised, parallel, two-arm, double-blind, multi-centre, multinational, treat-to-target trial 
comparing  IDegLira with IDeg in subjects with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with basal 
insulin and metformin with or without SU or glinides. Eligible subjects were randomised 1:1 to 2 
treatment arms consisting of once daily IDegLira or once daily IDeg both in combination with 
metformin. The maximum dose of IDeg was limited to 50 units. This creates an artificial situation, but 
was done to enable an evaluation of the contribution of the liraglutide component to glycaemic control. 
Total number of subjects in this study was 398, which is considered acceptable. 
Trial 3697 was conducted in subjects failing metformin ± pioglitazone. Subjects were randomised to 
receive IDegLira, Ideg or Lira in addition to their current treatment. Thus, the study population differs 
from the target population for this application. In addition, subjects received 2 medicines in addition to 
their current treatment, while normally one drug will be added. In addition, subjects in the IDegLira 
group started with a low dose of liraglutide (0.36mg) compared to the recommended starting dose of 
0.6mg for Liraglutide as separate component. This might have influenced safety, in particular GI-side 
effects, in favour of IDegLira. Thus, data from this trial might not be generalised to a population failing 
on insulin + OADs who start with Liraglutide 0.6mg. 
Trial 1842 investigated the effects of adding insulin to subjects failing on liraglutide + metformin. This 
study has been assessed before in 2 Type 2 variations (for liraglutide and insulin detemir). The 
limitation of this study was that it only gives information about the efficacy and safety of insulin 
detemir when added to metformin + liraglutide. The impact of liraglutide itself in this triple therapy 
was not demonstrated. The trial might have supportive value for safety aspects.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the main clinical trial 3948 addition of liraglutide resulted in a mean reduction in HbA1c of 
-0.73% compared to -0.40% with addition of IAsp. The difference was statistically significant in favour 
of IDeg + Lira (mean difference -0.32 [95% CI: -0.53;-0.12]). It should be taken into account that 
HbA1c was intermediately high at baseline (7.7%). When compared to IDeg + IAsp, more patients 
reached the target criteria and did so with less hypoglycaemias, although the figures given by the MAH 
are somewhat flattered as for this analysis only subjects were included who completed the last 12 
weeks of the study. A reduction in body weight was seen with IDeg + Lira: -3.03 kg with IDeg + Lira 
vs +0.72 Kg with IDeg + IAsp. Data from this trial indicate that the addition of liraglutide in patients 
failing on insulin + metformin can be effective. However, the comparison with IAsp was not quite valid, 
as it can be assumed that once daily dosing of IAsp might not be optimal in these patients. On the 
other hand, the reduction in hypoglycaemias is in favour of liraglutide.    
Trial 3912 showed a treatment difference between IDegLira and IDeg (Max dose 50 units) of about 
1% reduction in HbA1c. This difference is attributable to liraglutide, and thus these results are in 
favour of the addition of liraglutide in patients failing on insulin + metformin. The fact that the fixed 
ratio combination IDegLira was used in this study instead of IDeg + Lira is not considered a main 
issue, as pharmacokinetics of the fixed dose are similar to those of the separate components. 
Trial 3697 showed superiority of IDegLira over IDeg and Lira when added to metformin. However, 
these results do not contribute to the claimed indication. 
Trial 1842 does not contribute either to the claimed indication. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Trial 3948 and trial 3912 indicate that liraglutide might be effective in subjects not sufficiently 
controlled by insulin + metformin. However, the number of subjects in the main trial (3948) was 
limited. 
2.4.  Clinical Safety aspects 
The safety data from the four clinical trials were not pooled due to differences in study design. All trials 
had a follow-up duration of 26 weeks and trial 3697 and 1842 had an extension period of 26 weeks and 
these extension periods were also used for the clinical safety analysis. 
Two analysis sets were used for the safety evaluation, as defined below: 
  Safety analysis set (SAS): includes subjects receiving at least one dose of the investigational 
medicinal product or comparators. Subjects in the safety analysis set were contributed to the 
evaluation ‘as treated’. 
  Full analysis set (FAS): all randomised subjects in the trial. The statistical evaluation of the FAS 
followed the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle and subjects contributed to the evaluation “as 
randomised”. In Trial 1842 only subjects with at least one efficacy value after the randomisation 
visit were included in the FAS.

Table 6. Exposure to IDeg+liraglutide, IDegLira or IDet+liraglutide across the trials 3948, 
3697, 3912, 1842-SAS 
In Trial 3948, mean average daily dose IDeg was 0.65 U/kg in the IDeg + Lira and 0.64 U/kg in the IDeg 
+ IAsp arm. Concerning liraglutide, 2 (2.3%) subjects were taking liraglutide 0.6 mg/day, 28 (32.2%) 
were taking 1.2 mg/day and 57 (65.5%) were taking 1.8 mg/day. 
In trial 3679, mean average daily insulin dose was 31.0 units/day in the IDegLira group compared to 
36.9 units/day in the IDeg group. The mean average daily liraglutide dose in the IDegLira group was 1.1 
mg/day compared to 1.7 mg/day in the liraglutide group. 
In trial 3912, mean average daily insulin dose was 38.2 units/day in the IDegLira group compared to 
38.6 units/day in the IDeg group. 
In trial 1842, subjects were exposed to 1.8 mg liraglutide and a mean average daily dose of 39.8 IU IDet 
in the IDet+liraglutide group. 
2.4.2.  Results 
Adverse events 
For trial 3948, number of adverse events and their severity is shown in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/805158/2013 
Page 13/30 
 
  
  
 
Table 7. The combined use of IDeg with liraglutide led to a higher rate of adverse events compared to 
IDeg used with IAsp (517/100 PY vs 274/100 PY respectively). In total 62.4% of all subjects reported 318 
events in trial 3948. The observed rate of adverse events was 517 events per 100 PYE in IDegLira group 
and 274.1 events per 100 PYE in the IDeg group. Most events were of mild severity.  
The most frequently reported AEs in the IDeg + liraglutide treatment group were nausea (reported by 
20.7% of the subjects), diarrhoea (10.3% of the subjects) and nasopharyngitis (10.3% of the subjects). 
The most frequently reported AE in the IDeg + IAsp treatment group was nasopharyngitis, reported by 
12.8% of the subjects. The differences in adverse events in the IDeg + liraglutide group compared to the 
IDeg + IAsp group were mainly caused by more gastro-intestinal adverse events, as expected from 
liraglutide, and this was also observed in the IDegLira Trials 3697 and 3912 and in Trial 1842 (IDet + 
liraglutide). No new types of adverse events were reported for the combined use of IDeg + liraglutide.

Table 7. Adverse events-treatment emergency-Trial 3948 
In Trial 3697, the percentage of subjects reporting AEs during the first 26-week treatment period was 
63.2%, 60.2% and 72.6%, for IDegLira, IDeg and Lira respectively with corresponding rates 482.8 and 
430.0 and 640.5 events per 100 PYE 
The AE rates over the 52-week period were 407.9, 383.3 and 507.3 events per 100 PYE for IDegLira, 
IDeg and Lira, respectively. 
In Trial 3912, the percentage of subjects reporting AEs was similar for IDegLira (57.8%) and IDeg 
(61.3%). The rate of AEs in the IDegLira group (398.1 events per 100 PYE) was similar to the rate in the 
IDeg group (355.5 events per 100 PYE). Most AEs were mild or moderate in both treatment groups and 
the rate of severe AEs in the IDegLira group (7.6 events per 100 PYE) was similar to the rate in the IDeg 
group (8.9 events per 100 PYE). 
In Trial 1842, the percentage of subjects reporting AEs during the entire trial (run-in to end of trial) was 
similar for the liraglutide group (78.0%) and the IDet + liraglutide group (81.0%). Most AEs were mild or 
moderate in both treatment groups and the percentage of subjects having severe AEs in the liraglutide 
group (8.8%) was similar to the IDet + liraglutide group (10.4%). Most AEs were assessed as unlikely 
related to trial product by the investigator in both treatment groups with no difference between the 
treatment groups. 
According to the Applicant, the proportion of subjects with AEs for subjects treated with IDegLira or 
liraglutide + IDet were within the same range as the proportions of subjects with AEs in the IDeg + 
liraglutide group in Trial 3948: 70.1% in Trial 3948; 71.2% in Trial 3697; 57.8% in Trial 3912 and 
81.0 % in Trial 1842.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
In trial 3948 and 3912 no deaths were reported. 
In trial 3697, 2 treatment-emergent and 1 non treatment-emergent deaths were seen. All subjects were 
treated with IDegLira.  
Trial 1842 reported 1 treatment-emergent death in the liraglutide group.  
SAEs 
There were 9 SAEs in the randomised arms of Trial 3948: 4 in the IDeg + liraglutide group and 5 in the 
IDeg + IAsp group, corresponding to a rate of 10 and 12 events per 100 PYE. None of these were related 
to trial product as assessed by the investigator. 
In the supportive trials the percentage of subjects with SAEs was low and in the same range as in Trial 
3948. No pattern or clustering of events was observed during the trials, and no preferred terms were 
reported for more than 1% of the subjects. The most frequently reported SAEs were represented in the 
SOCs ‘cardiac disorders’, ‘infections and infestations’ and ‘nervous system disorders’. 2 SAE`S 
hypoglycaemia were reported in 3697 and 1 in 3912. 
Cardiovascular events 
In all 4 trials, the numbers of MACEs were low and with no apparent difference in the rate of MACE 
reported by subjects treated with the combined used of IDeg and Lira (as a free or fixed ratio 
combination) compared to subjects treated with IDeg + IAsp or with the IDeg or Lira monocomponents. 
However, the numbers are very small and should be interpreted with caution. 
In 3948, one event was classified as a stroke in the IDeg +IAsp group. 
In the pooled data from Trials 3697 and 3912, a total of 216 cardiovascular events reported for 
167 subjects were identified based on the SMQ search. The rate of cardiovascular events was 13.7 events 
per 100 PYE in the IDegLira group, 14.3 for IDeg and 13.2 for liraglutide. The most frequently reported 
cardiovascular event in the search was ‘oedema peripheral’ with no difference among the treatment 
groups. The majority of cardiovascular events were mild or moderate, and the rate of severe 
cardiovascular events with IDegLira, IDeg and liraglutide was 0.9, 1.6 and 1.2 events per 100 PYE, 
respectively. 
In Trial 1842, 4 serious treatment-emergent cardiovascular events during the trial were identified: 2 in 
the liraglutide group (cardiac failure and angina) and 2 in the IDet + liraglutide group (coronary artery 
disease and angina). All events were assessed as unlikely related to trial treatment. 
Pancreatitis 
In the pivotal study 3948 a total of 12 TEAEs for 7 subjects were identified as pancreas-related. The rate 
of pancreas-related events was 27 events per 100 PYE with IDeg + liraglutide and 2 events per 100 PYE 
with IDeg + IAsp. One event of pancreatitis was reported for 1 person in the IDeg+IAsp OD group. Seven 
(7) events of ‘lipase increased’ were reported for 6 subjects (all in the IDeg + liraglutide treatment 
group); 4 of these subjects also reported events of ‘amylase increased’.  The increase in amylase and 
lipase in the IDeg+Liraglutide group, were not associated with pancreatitis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/805158/2013 
Page 16/30 
 
  
  
 
 
In the pooled data from Trials 3697 and 3912, 5 events of pancreatitis for 5 subjects were identified: 2 
of these were confirmed by the external EAC as events of acute pancreatitis (1 with IDeg and 1 with 
Lira). No confirmed episodes of pancreatitis were reported with IDegLira. 
In addition, 17 events of elevated lipase and/or amylase reported for 15 subjects were identified based 
on predefined criteria and sent to the external EAC for adjudication; 1 event of ‘lipase increased’ in the 
liraglutide group was confirmed to be acute pancreatitis by the EAC. 
In trial 1842, 2 events of pancreatitis were reported in the liraglutide arm. In addition, increase in lipase 
was seen in 10-16% of subjects treated with liraglutide or IDet+Lira. 
Neoplasms 
The overall rates of neoplasms reported in the IDeg + liraglutide and IDegLira treatment groups were low 
and similar to those reported in the comparator groups in the four trials. The rates of malignant 
neoplasms were similar between IDeg + liraglutide and IDeg + IAsp and between IDegLira and IDeg.  
In the pooled safety dataset 3697/3912 the neoplasm event rate was 3.3 per 100 PYE in the IDegLira 
group, 2.5 per 100 PYE in the IDeg group and 3.3 per 100 PYE in the liraglutide group. 
Hypoglycaemia 
Confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes consisted of episodes of severe hypoglycaemia as well as minor 
hypoglycaemic episodes with a confirmed PG value of less than 3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL).  
In trial 3948 no episodes of severe hypoglycaemia were observed. The percentage of subjects who 
experienced confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes during the treatment period was 27.6% in the IDeg + 
Lira group and 67.4% in the IDeg + IAsp group. The rate of confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes per 100 
PYE was lower in the IDeg + Lira group compared with IDeg + IAsp (100 and 815 episodes per 100 PYE, 
respectively). 
For the pooled trials 3697 and 3912, a total of eight episodes of severe hypoglycaemia were reported. 4 
episodes in the IDegLira groups, 2 in the liraglutide group and 2 in the IDeg group. In study 3697, the 
percentage of subjects who experienced confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes during the first 26-week 
treatment period was 31.9% in the IDegLira group compared to 38.6% in the IDeg group and 6.8% for 
liraglutide.  In Trial 3912, the rate of confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes with IDegLira was 153.4 events 
per 100 PYE) and with IDeg 263.3 events per 100 PYE, although the proportion of subjects experiencing 
confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes were similar for IDegLira and IDeg (24.1% and 24.6%). 
In trial 1842, there were no severe episodes of hypoglycaemia in the randomized groups. 
Laboratory findings 
Apart from changes in lipase/amylase no clinically relevant changes in haematology and biochemistry 
parameters were observed from baseline to end of treatment in any of the treatment groups in all trials. 
In all 4 trials, amylase and lipase values appeared unchanged by insulin treatment as seen in the IDeg 
+ IAsp group of Trial 3948 and the IDeg groups of Trial 3697 and 3912. An increase in amylase and 
lipase values was observed in all 4 trials with liraglutide treatment (as liraglutide, IDegLira, IDeg + 
liraglutide and IDet + liraglutide). The increase in amylase and lipase values with liraglutide was not 
affected by concomitant treatment with insulin. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/805158/2013 
Page 17/30 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The proportion of subjects having lipase values above the reference range increased from appoximately 
10% at baseline to approximately 30% in the IDeg + liraglutide group and 15% in the IDeg + IAsp group 
at Week 26 in trial 3948. 
Immunological events 
Few events of allergic reactions were reported for the main Trial 3948 and the supportive Trials 3697 
and 3912, and there was no difference among treatment groups. The majority of the events were not 
related to the trial products. 
In the supportive trials 3697 and 3912, 5 and 8% of patients treated with IDegLira developed antibodies 
to human insulin or insulin degludec antibodies within 26-52 weeks after the start of treatment compared 
to 2and 3% for IDeg. None of these antibodies were shown to neutralize the activity of human insulin or 
insulin degludec. Few subjects developed anti-liraglutide antibodies (0.5-3% at different time points). Of 
these 5 (4 with IDegLira and 1 with liraglutide) were demonstrated to have an in vitro neutralising effect 
at Week 53 in trial 3697. 
Safety in special populations 
About one third of the subjects included in the pivotal trial were elderly subjects (> 65 years): 36.8% of 
the subjects in the IDeg + liraglutide group and 33.7% in the IDeg + IAsp OD group (Table 8). There 
was no indication of a higher rate of AEs in elderly subjects compared to adult subjects treated with IDeg 
+ liraglutide. However, in both treatment groups, the rate of confirmed hypoglycaemia was lower in 
subjects aged 18-65 years. 
In the supportive trials 3697 and 3912, no impact of age on AE rates was apparent. An analysis of 
intrinsic and extrinsic factors was not performed in trial 1842.

Approximately 5% of subjects in the 4 trials were withdrawn due to AEs. Apart from ‘gastrointestinal 
disorders’, no clustering in type of adverse event withdrawals was observed and no treatment group 
difference was apparent with respect to number of subject withdrawals due to adverse events. 
Post marketing experience 
The post marketing experience with Tresiba is currently very limited. Tresiba was launched in the United 
Kingdom on 28 January 2013, in Denmark on 04 March 2013, in Japan on 07 March 2013, in Mexico on 
21 May 2013 and in Switzerland 04 June 2013.The first periodic safety update report for Tresiba was 
submitted on 03 June 2013.  
No safety signal has emerged when Victoza is used in combination with insulin compared to the signals 
reported with the separate use of the products based on spontaneous AEs reporting. No new significant 
information on drug interactions, drug abuse or misuse, experiences during pregnancy or lactation, 
experience in special patient groups or on the effects of long-term treatment was received during the 
reporting period for Victoza (cut-off 30 December 2012). 
2.4.3.  Discussion 
Safety data were presented from the four clinical trials. Data were not pooled due to differences in study 
design. A total of 1274 patients with type 2 diabetes have been exposed to a combination therapy with 
liraglutide and basal insulin (IDeg+liraglutide, IDegLira or IDet + liraglutide), of which 751 have been 
exposed for at least 52 weeks. All patients in the studies were exposed to liraglutide and basal insulin on 
a background therapy of metformin. In addition, in trial 3697, 17.0% were using a combination of 
metformin and pioglitazone. 
The pivotal study 3948 is a relatively small study (N=87 for the IDeg + Lira arm) with a short study 
duration (26 weeks), not enough to prove safety.  To conclude on safety, the data of the supportive 
studies are also of importance due to the higher number of subjects exposed to both liraglutide and 
insulin in the same period (N=825 in trial 3697 and N=621 completed the extension period)(N=199 in 
3912 group)(N=163 in trial 1842 and N=130 completed the extension period). In trial 3697 and 3912 
IDegLira was used in a fixed ratio combination, and therefore not completely comparable to the real life 
situation in which different dose combinations of insulin and liraglutide will be used. More experience with 
the combined use of IDegLira as well as IDet +liraglutide comes from the extension periods in trial 3697 
and 1842 and the data assessed in this current application is considered as sufficient to assess short term 
safety. The safety analysis set is overall representative of a population of adult patients with T2DM, the 
majority of subjects had a mean diabetes duration > 5-10 years. 
The most common adverse events associated with liraglutide and basal insulin are gastrointestinal side 
effects as expected due to the liraglutide component. In study 3948 the incidence for IDeg+Lira, 
IDeg+IAsp, respectively were; nausea (20.7 and 1.2%), diarrhoea (10.3 and 1.2%), vomiting (5.7 and 
0%). In study 3697 the incidence for IDegLira, IDeg and Lira, respectively were; nausea (10.3, 3.9, 22.3 
%), diarrhoea (10.2, 6.8, 16.3%), vomiting (5.0, 2.4, 9.2%).These adverse events have previously been 
shown to be related to the actual liraglutide dose and also to the rate of dose uptitration. Since the actual 
dose of liraglutide was lower in trial 3697 and the dose uptitration slower in the IDegLira compared to the 
Lira group, the lower incidence in the IDegLira group is an expected finding.  Thus, GI data from IDegLira 
might not be generalised to a population failing on insulin + OADs who start with Liraglutide 0.6mg. 
As expected, the incidence of hypoglycaemia was lower in the IDeg + Lira group compared to the IDeg + 
IAsp group in trial 3948. Rates of confirmed hypoglycaemia were slightly higher in the elderly in both 
treatment groups (IDeg + Lira >65yrs: 157.5, ≤65 yrs: 66.8; IDeg + IAsp >65 yrs:1050.1, ≤65 yrs:

695.7) but rates were lower in the IDeg + Lira group as compared to the IDeg + IAsp group. Also, in 
study 3697 the incidence of hypoglycaemia was lowest in the liraglutide group. The higher incidence for 
IDeg compared to IDegLira in that study is most likely due to the higher insulin dose. In study 3912 the 
incidences were similar in the two groups. In conclusion, there is no indication of an additive effect with 
respect to the risk of hypoglycaemia when IDeg is combined with Lira. However, there were 3 
hypoglycaemia SAEs reported in patients on IDegLira in trial 3697 and 3912which should be further 
discussed. 
The current safety data base is too small to draw conclusions with respect to cardiovascular safety of the 
combination of IDeg and Liraglutide. An increased pulse rate was observed with GLP-1 use, so the 
outcomes of the ongoing CV outcome studies are of clinical relevance. 
There is limited experience of use of liraglutide and basal insulin in patients with congestive heart failure 
NYHA class I-II. There is no experience in patients with congestive heart failure NYHA class III-IV.  
The number of potential events of acute pancreatitis and pancreatic enzyme elevations was low and no 
confirmed episodes of pancreatitis were reported with combination of liraglutide and basal insulin therapy.  
Acute pancreatitis has been previously identified as a potential safety issues for the GLP-1 receptor 
agonist class.  Acute pancreatitis is included in the RMP as important identified risk. 
The incidence of allergic reactions seen in the IDeg+liraglutide treated group in the pivotal study was low, 
one subject had a possible reaction on liraglutide and withdrew. In the pooled safety analysis set of 
supportive trials 3697 and 3912 the incidence was low (0.9%) and numerically lower than for the other 
treatments.  In the supportive trials 4.8% of patients treated with IDegLira had an increase in antibodies 
to human insulin or specific insulin antibodies to insulin compared to 1.9% of patients treated with IDeg. 
No neutralising insulin anti-bodies were detected. Few subjects developed anti-liraglutide antibodies (0.5-
3% after 52 weeks treatment), 4 subjects treated with IDegLira had anti-bodies that were demonstrated 
to have an in vitro neutralising effect. Overall, antibody development has previously been detected for 
both liraglutide (8.6%) and IDeg. 
GLP-1 receptor agonists have been associated with thyroid C-cells proliferative/hyperplasia in non-clinical 
carcinogenicity studies, but the relevance for humans is unsure. The current data base is too limited and 
the duration of the studies too short to provide any useful information about thyroid or other neoplasms. 
The potential tumour growth promoting effect of insulin analogues due to their anabolic properties is an 
ongoing discussion. However, no firm association has been established between any insulin analogues 
and increased cancer risk. Considering the findings of C-cell tumors in rats when given liraglutide, an 
additive effect on the risk of malignancies when combining Lira and Ideg could be hypothesised. However, 
this risk seems very remote and is not considered strong enough to justify a request for specific PAS 
studies. Long term PAS studies are ongoing for both Lira and IDeg which will provide more information 
about neoplasms. As a result of the recent art 5(3) procedure, pancreatic  cancer should be included in 
the RMP as a potential risk. In the current clinical development program, one subject treated with 
liraglutide was diagnosed with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. No medullary thyroid cancer event 
was reported in any of the treatment groups.  
The incidence of AEs were similar in patients below and above age 65 years. The number of subjects ≥ 75 
years is very low. 
Since all patients had a background therapy of metformin there is no clinical experience of liraglutide and 
basal insulin administered alone or in combinations with other oral antidiabetic drugs than metformin or a 
combination of metformin and pioglitazone. One-hundred-forty (140) patients were treated with IDegLira 
in combination with metformin+pioglitazone. There were no indications of increased incidence of adverse 
events in these patients.

2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile for IDegLira is in general similar to the two included mono-components with no 
indications of additive toxicity. Since the actual liraglutide dose in the studies was lower and the up-
titration of dose somewhat slower the prevalence and severity of the well-known gastrointestinal side-
effects were lower compared to liraglutide as monotherapy. No new safety issues have been identified for 
this combination.  There are some issues that need further clarification, e.g. possible risk of mix-ups and 
medication errors. 
With regard to the long-term safety, the initial cardiovascular safety evaluation is acceptable with a 
potentially beneficial effect on systolic blood pressure in contrast to slight increase in heart rate in the 
clinical studies. Otherwise, the long-term safety concerns are the same as for the other GLP-1 agonist 
and insulin analogues, i.e. identified risk of pancreatitis and potential risks of malignancies e.g. pancreatic 
and thyroid tumours.  
2.5.  Changes to the Product Information 
The MAH proposed the following changes to the Product Information (PI), to which the CHMP agreed:  
Section 4.1 of the SmPC  
was amended to reflect the new combination with basal insulin. In addition to this the MAH  simplified 
the indication for Victoza as follows. 
Victoza is indicated for treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus to achieve glycaemic control in 
combination with: oral glucose-lowering medicinal products and/or basal insulin when these, together 
with  diet  and  exercise,  do  not  provide  adequate  glycaemic  control  (see  sections  4.4  and  5.1  for 
available data on the different combinations). 
– 
Metformin  or  a  sulphonylurea,  in  patients  with  insufficient  glycaemic  control  despite  maximal 
tolerated dose of monotherapy with metformin or sulphonylurea. 
In combination with: 
– 
Metformin and a sulphonylurea or metformin and a thiazolidinedione in patients with insufficient 
glycaemic control despite dual therapy. 
Section 4.2 of the SmPC  
was amended to reflect the combination with basal insulin as follows (similar additions were made to 
4.4, 4.7): 
[…] 
Victoza  can  be  added  to  existing  sulphonylurea  or  to  a  combination  of  metformin  and  sulphonylurea 
therapy or a basal insulin. When Victoza is added to sulphonylurea therapy or basal insulin, a reduction 
in the dose of sulphonylurea or basal insulin should be considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia 
(see section 4.4). 
Self-monitoring of blood glucose is not needed in order to adjust the dose of Victoza. However, when 
initiating treatment with Victoza in combination with a sulphonylurea  or a basal insulin, blood glucose 
self-monitoring may become necessary to adjust the dose of the sulphonylurea or the basal insulin. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/805158/2013 
Page 21/30 
 
  
  
 
 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC  
was  amended  to  reflect  that  the  data  for  the  combination  of  liraglutide  and  insulin  degludec  is  no 
longer missing.  
[…] 
Victoza is not a substitute for insulin.  
The  addition  of  liraglutide  in  patients  already  treated  with  insulin  has  not  been  evaluated  and  is 
therefore not recommended. 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC  
was amended to provide information on hypoglycaemic events as follows: 
[…] 
Hypoglycaemia 
Most  episodes  of  confirmed  hypoglycaemia  in  clinical  studies  were  minor.  No  episodes  of  major 
hypoglycaemia  were  observed  in  the  study  with  Victoza  used  as  monotherapy.  Major  hypoglycaemia 
may  occur  uncommonly  and  has  primarily  been  observed  when  Victoza  is  combined  with  a 
sulphonylurea  (0.02 events/subject  year).  Very  few  episodes  (0.001 events/subject  year)  were 
observed  with  administration  of  Victoza  in  combination  with  oral  antidiabetics  other  than 
sulphonylureas.  The  risk  of  hypoglycaemia  is  low  with  combined  use  of  basal  insulin  and  liraglutide 
(1.0 events per subject year, see section 5.1). 
Section 5.1 of the SmPC  
was amended to reflect the available data for the combination with insulin as follows: 
[…] 
Combination with insulin 
In  a  104-week  clinical  trial,  57%  of  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  treated  with  insulin  degludec  in 
combination with metformin achieved a target HbA1c <7% and the remaining patients continued in a 
26-week open label trial and were randomised to add liraglutide or a single dose of insulin aspart (with 
the largest meal). In the insulin degludec +  liraglutide arm, the insulin dose  was reduced by 20% in 
order  to  minimize  the  risk  of  hypoglycaemia.  Addition  of  liraglutide  resulted  in  a  statistically 
significantly  greater  reduction  of  HbA1c  (-0.73%  for  liraglutide  vs  -0.40%  for  comparator)  and  body 
weight  (-3.03  vs  0.72  kg).  The  rate  of  hypoglycaemic  episodes  (per  patient  year  of  exposure)  was 
statistically  significantly  lower  when  adding  liraglutide  compared  to  adding  a  single  dose  of  insulin 
aspart (1.0 vs 8.15; ratio: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.21).  
Additional  minor  changes  related  to  renaming  of  tables,  and  moving  the  paragraph  regarding  the 
combination of liraglutide with insulin detemir  to the section on “Combination with insulin”, were also 
made.  
The package leaflet was amended accordingly as follows:

Section 1 - What Victoza is and what it is used for 
[…] 
Victoza is used with other medicines for diabetes when they are not enough to control your blood sugar 
levels. These may include: 
oral antidiabetics (such as metformin, pioglitazone, sulphonylurea medicines) and/or a basal insulin, a 
type of insulin which works all day.to treat adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus when: 
– 
metformin or a sulphonylurea alone (such as glimepiride or glibenclamide) despite the maximal 
tolerated dose are not enough to control your blood sugar levels. 
– 
metformin in combination with a sulphonylurea (such as glimepiride or glibenclamide) or 
metformin in combination with a glitazone (such as pioglitazone) are not enough to control your blood 
sugar levels. 
Section 2 - What you need to know before you use Victoza 
In particular, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are using medicines for diabetes containing 
any of the following active substances: 
• 
• 
Insulin. Victoza is not recommended if you are already using insulin. 
Sulphonylurea (such as glimepiride or glibenclamide). You may get hypoglycaemia (low blood 
sugar) when using Victoza together with a sulphonylurea as sulphonylureas increase the risk of 
hypoglycaemia. When you first start using these medicines together, your doctor may tell you to lower 
the dose of the sulphonylurea medicine. Please see section 4 for the warnings signs of low blood sugar. 
Section 4 - Possible side effects 
Serious side effects 
Common: may affect up to 1 in 10 people 
• 
Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). The warning signs of low blood sugar may come on suddenly 
and can include: cold sweat, cool pale skin, headache, fast heart beat, feeling sick, feeling very 
hungry, changes in vision, feeling sleepy, feeling weak, nervous, anxious, confused, difficulty 
concentrating, shaking (tremor). Your doctor will tell you how to treat low blood sugar and what to do 
if you notice these warning signs. This is more likely to happen if you also take a sulphonylurea or a 
basal insulin.Your doctor may reduce your dose of these medicines before you start using Victoza.If 
you are already taking a sulphonylurea medicine when you start using Victoza, your doctor may tell 
you to reduce the dose of the sulphonylurea. 
2.6.  Significance  of paediatric studies 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0003/2013 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0003/2013 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred.

3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
In support of this application, the MAH has submitted four clinical trials: one pivotal (study 3948), and 
three supportive trials (3697, 3912 and 1842). Trial 3697 and 3912 were submitted with the MAA for 
IDegLira; trial 3948 was also submitted with the MAA for IDegLira, but as supportive study; trial 1842 
was submitted in Type 2 variations for liraglutide and for insulin detemir and has been assessed in 
those procedures. 
The pivotal study 3498 was a 26-week randomised, controlled study comparing the efficacy of 
liraglutide vs Insulin Aspart (IAsp) as add-on therapy in subjects insufficiently controlled by Insulin 
Degludec (IDeg) + Metformin In total, 177 subjects were randomised, 88 subjects were randomised to 
IDeg + Liraglutide and 89 to IDeg + IAsp once daily with the largest meal. IDeg and IAsp were titrated 
to target. IDeg dose was reduced by 20 % in the IDeg+liraglutide arm at baseline. 
Study 3697 was a three-armed study (834 subjects in IDegLira group, 414 in Ideg group, 415 in 
liraglutide group) including insulin-naïve patients with inadequate metabolic control on metformin+/-
pioglitazone. The duration of the study was 26 weeks and there was a 26 week extension period. In 
this study IDegLira, given at a maximum dose of 50 dose steps (50 units of IDeg and 1.8 mg 
liraglutide), was compared with IDeg which was titrated to target and liraglutide administered 
according to label. In the smaller study 3912 (26 weeks), IDegLira treatment (207 subjects) was 
compared with IDeg (206 subjects) given at a maximum dose of 50 units, thereby evaluating the 
contribution of the liraglutide component. Trial 1842 investigated the effect of adding IDet in insulin-
naïve subjects with T2DM inadequately controlled on liraglutide and metformin after a run-in period of 
12 weeks. The duration of the trial was 26 weeks and this trial had also an extension period of 26 
weeks.162 subjects were included in the IDet + liraglutide arm and 161 in liraglutide arm. 
The studies were generally well designed and conducted. The pivotal study was relatively small, trial 
3697 included insulin-naïve patients and this is not in line with the claimed indication, add-on to 
subjects failing on insulin ± OADs. Study 3697 and 3912 investigated the fixed ratio combination 
IDegLira and are not completely comparable to the combined use of the separate monosupplements, 
especially with regard to the titration procedure. Trial 1842 investigated the effects of adding IDet to 
liraglutide, and not the efficacy of liraglutide. Therefore this trial does not contribute to the claimed 
indication. 
The outcome of study 3948, showed that the effect of IDeg + liraglutide on HbA1c reduction was 
superior to IDeg + IAsp once daily. HbA1c decreased by 0.74% with IDeg+liraglutide and by 0.39% 
with IDeg+IAsp. The difference was statistically significant. A total of 58.0% of subjects on IDeg + 
liraglutide achieved an HbA1c <7% compared to 44.9% with IDeg + IAsp (NS), while 54.3% and 
19.3% achieved the target without confirmed hypoglycaemia (estimated odds ratio (IDeg + liraglutide 
/ IDeg + IAsp): 5.57 [2.67; 11.63]95%CI). A total of 49.4% vs. 7.2% achieved this target without 
confirmed hypoglycaemia and weight gain (estimated odds ratio: 13.79 [5.24; 36.28]95%CI).  
After 26 weeks of treatment, the mean daily IDeg dose in the IDeg + liraglutide group was 0.65 U/kg 
and 0.64 U/kg in the IDeg + IAsp arm. By Week 26, 32.2% of subjects treated with IDeg + liraglutide 
administered 1.2 mg/day and 65.5% administered 1.8 mg/day of liraglutide. The mean daily IAsp dose 
was 0.21 U/kg in the IDeg + IAsp arm.

Other secondary endpoints supported the primary outcome. The estimated mean change in FPG was 
comparable between treatments with an estimated treatment difference (IDeg+liraglutide – 
IDeg+IAsp) of 0.06 mmol/L [−0.65; 0.77]95%CI. Nine-point SMPG values improved in both groups. 
Prandial increments did not differ significantly between treatment groups. The observed change in 
body weight was -2.8 kg and 0.9 kg with IDeg + liraglutide and IDeg + IAsp, respectively, with an 
estimated treatment difference (IDeg+liraglutide – IDeg+IAsp) of -3.75 kg [-4.70; -2.79]95%CI.  
The outcome of study 3697 showed that the effect of IDegLira on HbA1c reduction was superior to 
both the mono-components (HbA1c decreased by 1.91%with IDegLira, by 1.44% with IDeg and by 
1.28% with liraglutide). The differences were statistically significant. Data from the extension study 
showed that this effect was maintained up to 52 weeks with only marginally increased doses of 
IDegLira. The reduction in HbA1c was also reflected in significantly higher responder rates with 
IDegLira, both when applying the HbA1c cut-off of 7 % (80.6 %) and the stricter cut-off of 6.5 % 
(69.7 %) compared to both mono-components (IDeg 65.1 % and 47.5 %; liraglutide 60.4 % and 
41.1 %). Higher proportions of patients reached the responder target without experiencing 
hypoglycaemia or weight gain in the IDegLira group compared to IDeg treated subjects whereas no 
difference was observed compared to liraglutide. 
Insulin doses were significantly lower in the IDegLira treated group compared to the IDeg treated 
group. At week 26 the mean insulin dose in the IDegLira group was 38 dose steps and 39.7% of 
subjects reached a daily insulin dose of 50 dose steps. In the IDeg groups the mean insulin dose was 
53 units and 53.9 % of patients were on doses > 50 units. 
Other secondary endpoints supported the primary outcome. A comparable effect on FPG was observed 
with IDegLira and IDeg (-3.62 mmol/L vs. -3.61 mmol/L, liraglutide -1.75 mmol/L), whereas the effect 
on post-prandial glucose increment was comparable for IDegLira and liraglutide (iAUC0-4h: 
-0.87 mmol/L vs. -0.78 mmol/L, IDeg -0.16 mmol/L). Body weight was reduced by 0.5 kg in the 
IDegLira group as compared to an increase by 1.6 kg in the IDeg group and a decrease by 3.0 kg in 
the liraglutide group. 
In study 3912, where the IDeg dose in both arms was maximised to 50 units, HbA1c decreased by 
1.90 % with IDegLira and by 0.89 % with IDeg. The reduction in HbA1c was statistically significantly 
greater with IDegLira compared with IDeg. The HbA1c targets of 7% and 6.5% were reached by 
60.3% and 45.2% of IDegLira-treated subjects as compared to 23.1% and 13.1% of IDeg-treated 
subjects. No difference in insulin dose was observed between treatment arms with a mean insulin dose 
of 45 units for both arms at week 26. 
The primary endpoint was supported by significant reductions in FPG with IDegLira compared to IDeg 
(-3.46 mmol/L vs. -2.58 mmol/L). The SMPG profile which includes both the effect on FPG and post-
prandial glucose increment was also lower with IDegLira compared to IDeg. After 26 weeks of 
treatment, a change in body weight from of -2.7 kg and 0.0 kg was observed for IDegLira and IDeg, 
respectively. 
Transferring patients on basal insulin applying a starting dose of 16 dose steps IDegLira appears 
feasible and did not result in loss in metabolic control during the transition period. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
In study 3948, the active comparator IAsp was used once daily with the main meal. Participant in this 
trial were subjects not sufficiently controlled on insulin + metformin in spite of participation in clinical 
trials during 2 years. These patients were in need for intensification of treatment, and it is unlikely that 
IAsp administered once daily will be sufficient. Multiple daily injections will be needed in these

subjects. 
 In the studies, the combinations IDeg+liraglutide+metformin or IDegLira+metformin+/-pioglitazone 
or IDegLira + metformin or IDet+liraglutide+metformin have been studied and there is consequently 
no data on liraglutide and basal insulin added to SU therapy or insulin glargine in combination with 
liraglutide or the combination basal insulin + liraglutide without metformin. Studies, with these specific 
combinations are ongoing. 
The currently proposed indication states that Victoza should be used “in combination with oral glucose-
lowering medicinal products and/or basal insulin”. Concomitant use with SU and basal insulin has not 
been studied. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The most common adverse events associated with liraglutide in combination with insulin are 
gastrointestinal side effects, comparable to liraglutide use. In study 3948 the incidence for IDeg 
+Liraglutide, IDeg + IAsp, respectively were; nausea (20.7 and 1.2 %), diarrhoea (10.3 and 1.2%), 
vomiting (5.7 and 0%). In study in study 3697 the incidence for IDegLira, IDeg and Lira, respectively 
were; nausea (10.3, 3.9, 22.3 %), diarrhoea (10.2, 6.8, 16.3%), vomiting (5.0, 2.4, 9.2%). The GI 
AEs were transient. 
In study 3948, the observed rate of confirmed hypoglycaemia was 100 and 815 episodes per 100 PYE 
with IDeg + liraglutide and IDeg + IAsp, respectively with an 87% lower estimated rate with IDeg + 
liraglutide; estimated rate ratio: 0.13 [0.08; 0.21]95%CI. The observed rates of nocturnal 
hypoglycaemia were 17 and 111 episodes per 100 PYE with IDeg + liraglutide and IDeg + IAsp, 
respectively; estimated rate ratio 0.14[0.05; 0.40]95%CI.  
In study 3697, the percentage of subjects who experienced confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes during 
the first 26-week treatment period was 31.9% in the IDegLira group compared to 38.6% in the IDeg 
group and 6.8% for liraglutide.  In Trial 3912, the proportions of subjects experiencing confirmed 
hypoglycaemic episodes were 24.1% and 24.6% for IDegLira and IDeg, respectively (rate; IDegLira 
153.4 events, IDeg 263.3 events per 100 PYE). 
The incidence of allergic reactions seen in the IDegLira treated group in the pooled safety analysis set 
(3697 and 3912) was 0.9%. Injection site reactions related to IDegLira treatment was present in 2.9% 
of patients compared to 4.6% for Lira and 2.9% for IDeg.  
Five (5)% of patients treated with IDegLira had an increase in antibodies to human insulin or specific 
insulin antibodies to insulin compared to 2% of patients treated with IDeg in study 3697. In study 
3912, the percentages were 5 and 3% for I IDegLira and IDeg, respectively. No neutralising insulin 
anti-bodies were detected. Few subjects developed anti-liraglutide antibodies (0.5-3% at different time 
points in the IDegLira group). Antibodies were not tested in study 3948. 
No confirmed episodes of pancreatitis were reported in the liraglutide and basal insulin groups. 
However, a mean increase of serum lipase and amylase was seen the IDeg and liraglutide and 
liraglutide groups compared to patients treated with IDeg. Acute pancreatitis has been previously 
identified as a potential safety issues for the GLP-1 receptor agonist class.  Pancreatitis should be 
included in the RMP as important identified risk.

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The rate of neoplasm events in trial 3948 was 3 in the IDeg+liraglutide group and 2 in the IDeg+Iasp 
group. In the pooled data of 3697 and 3912 in the IDegLira group 3.3 events per 100 PYE were 
reported, for IDeg 2.5 events and for Lira 3.3 events per 100 PYE groups. The event rate with IDegLira 
was mainly driven by skin events (4 events of ‘basal cell carcinoma’ and 1 event of ‘malignant 
melanoma’). No medullary thyroid cancer event was reported in any of the treatment groups. As a 
result of the recent art 5(3) procedure, pancreatic cancer should be included in the RMP as a potential 
risk. 
The safety data base is too small to draw  conclusions with respect to cardiovascular safety. However, 
as also remarked in the Assessment Report for IDegLira, it is unclear why only 40 of the 216 
cardiovascular events identified by search qualified for adjudication and were sent to the EAC.  
There is no indication of an additive effect with respect to the risk of hypoglycaemia when IDeg is 
combined with Lira. However, there were 3 hypoglycaemia SAEs reported in patients on IDegLira which 
should be further discussed especially with respect to possible medication errors. The rates of 
confirmed hypoglycaemia were slightly higher in the elderly in the pivotal study in both study groups in 
the pivotal study. 
There is limited experience of use of liraglutide and basal insulin in patients with congestive heart 
failure NYHA class I-II. There is no experience in patients with congestive heart failure NYHA class III-
IV. 
The incidences of AEs were similar in patients below and above age 65 years, but the number of 
subjects ≥ 75 years is very low.  
The clinical experience of liraglutide and basal insulin in patients with moderate renal impairment is 
very limited (n=11) and use should not be recommended in line with recommendations for Victoza. 
There is no clinical experience of liraglutide and basal insulin administered alone or in combinations 
with other oral antidiabetic drugs than metformin or a combination of metformin and pioglitazone 
(n=140).  
There is no clinical experience of liraglutide in combination with insulin glargine. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The pivotal study 3948 and trial 3912 show that the addition of liraglutide to basal insulin in subjects 
failing on insulin+OADs results in a clinically relevant effect in terms of HbA1c lowering. In study 3948, 
the incidence of hypoglycaemia was lower with IDeg+Lira compared to IDeg+IAsp, in spite of the fact 
that the dose of IAsp apparently was too low for an effect on HbA1c. In study 3912 no difference in 
rate of hypoglycaemia was seen; however the effect on HbA1c was larger in the IDegLira group 
compared to IDeg. In this trial the dose of IDeg was limited to 50 units. 
In study 3697 also clinically relevant effects on HbA1c were found with IDegLira. However, subjects in 
this trial were insulin naïve, and thus not quite comparable to the target population for the claimed 
indication. 
The effect on body weight was not entirely consistent across the studies, but the combination is at 
least weight neutral, compared to weight increase with IAsp or IDeg, which is important in the T2DM 
population where overweight is often a problem.

The safety profile for basal insulin and liraglutide is in general similar to the two included mono-
components with no indications of additive toxicity. When using IDegLira, GI adverse events were 
lower compared to liraglutide given as monotherapy. This is due to the titration scheme for IDegLira 
and results might be misleading for liraglutide as add-on therapy, where titration steps are larger. 
No confirmed episodes of pancreatitis were reported with the combined use of basal insulin and 
liraglutide, but have been reported for other GLP 1 agonists. Acute pancreatitis has previously been 
identified as a potential safety issues for the GLP-1 receptor agonist class and the risk, albeit small, 
should be taken into account when prescribing these products. 
Other issues discussed for the GLP 1 agonists include risk of thyroid and pancreatic neoplasm. The 
current data base is too limited and the duration of the studies too short to provide any useful 
information. Long term PAS studies are ongoing for both Lira and IDeg which will provide more 
information, but there are currently no indications of an increased risk. As a result of the recent art 
5(3) procedure, pancreatic cancer should be included in the RMP as a potential risk.  
Currently, data on CV outcomes are still limited. Several CV outcome studies are ongoing, no further 
action is needed at the moment. 
In conclusion, for patients eligible for intensification of insulin treatment, Victoza may be a valuable 
alternative to adding only insulin/increasing the insulin dose since Victoza was shown to provide a 
superior HbA1c reduction combined with weight stability and a lower incidence of hypoglycaemia. 
However, Victoza and basal insulin are not investigated without metformin to date and furthermore, 
this combination is not tested with the combined use with SU.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The benefit-risk balance is currently positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The combination of basal insulin and a GLP-1 analogue in the treatment of T2DM has been previously 
evaluated and accepted for other products.  
The combined use of two drugs in case one of the drugs has shown insufficient results with 
complementary mechanisms of action by a) substituting for the relative insulin deficiency in T2DM and 
b) stimulate the endogenous insulin secretion is an adequate rationale and carries the potential of 
sparing beta-cell function over time. 
The appropriate target population for liraglutide as add-on to basal insulin could primarily be patients 
eligible for intensification of insulin treatment. This would include patients not adequately controlled on 
metformin and insulin (study 3948), not adequately controlled on metformin, insulin and SU (study 
3912). Liraglutide provided a superior glycaemic control compared to adding IAsp with the largest 
meal combined with the benefit of weight stability. An alternative treatment strategy could have been 
to increase the insulin dose further, but this would very likely have been associated with increased risk 
of hypoglycaemia and weight increase.  
Trial 3697 did not include the target population for the claimed indication, and trial 1842 did not 
investigate the effect of liraglutide. 
Concerning safety data for IDeg and liraglutide separately, this has been extensively assessed in the 
context of marketing approval applications for Tresiba and Victoza. Further, recently an article 5(3) 
procedure has been finalized reviewing pancreatic safety associated with the use of GLP 1 agonists. 
The extent of the exposure to the combination Victoza with insulin in the current application is 
considered as sufficient to assess short term safety.

In the submitted studies, all subjects received study treatment as add-on to metformin +/-pioglitazone 
and liraglutide with basal insulin has not been evaluated in combination with other OADs (study in 
combination with SU is ongoing), or in patients with insulin glargine treatment (study ongoing), or in 
patients with basal/bolus insulin regimen. Concomitant use of liraglutide with SU and basal insulin has 
not been studied. The new, broad indication might suggest that Liraglutide can be combined with 
insulin plus all OADs. This is inherent to the indication, which was approved for all SGLT-2 inhibitors. In 
section 5.1 all combinations that are studied are mentioned. For SGLT-2 inhibitors this was considered 
sufficient, so it can be accepted for Victoza too. 
GLP-1 receptor agonists have been associated with thyroid C-cells proliferative/hyperplasia in non-
clinical carcinogenicity studies, but the relevance for humans is unsure. The potential tumor growth 
promoting effect of insulin analogues due to their anabolic properties is an ongoing discussion. 
However, no firm association has been established between any insulin analogues and increased 
cancer risk. An additive effect on the risk of malignancies when combining Lira and IDeg could be 
hypothesized. However, this risk seems very remote and is not considered strong enough to justify a 
request for specific PAS studies. Long term post-authorisation safety studies are ongoing for both Lira 
and IDeg which will provide more information about neoplasms.

1.  Introduction 
On  5th  of  August  2021,  the  MAH  submitted  a  final  report  of  Gilenya  study  CFTY720D1401  for  the  14 
pediatric patients that completed this study in Japan, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) 
No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that CFTY720D1401 is part of a clinical development program.  
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Gilenya  is  already  indicated  in  Europe  as  single  disease  modifying  therapy  in  highly  active  relapsing 
remitting  Multiple  Sclerosis  for  the  following  groups  of  adult  patients  (since  2011)  and  paediatric 
patients aged 10 years and older (since 2018) : 
-Patients with highly active disease despite a full and adequate course of treatment with at least one 
disease modifying therapy or 
-Patients  with  rapidly  evolving  severe  relapsing  remitting  multiple  sclerosis  defined  by  2  or  more 
disabling  relapses  in  one  year,  and  with  1  or  more  Gadolinium  enhancing  lesions  on  brain  MRI  or  a 
significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI. 
Gilenya is available as capsules of 0.5 mg and 0.25 mg (for pediatric patients ≤40 kg) which are taken 
orally once-daily. Same formulation was used in the present study.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for the 14 pediatric MS patients that were included in CFTY720D1401 
(hereafter  referred  to  as  D1401).  Data  in  adult  were  not  assessed  since  only  pediatric  data  are 
concerned  in  this  Preliminary  assessment  report  for  paediatric  studies  submitted  in  accordance  with 
article 46 of regulation.  
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study D1401: a drug use investigation (all-case surveillance) study conducted in Japan 
Description 
Study D1401 was conducted jointly by Novartis and Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, based on 
the  conditions  for  approval  of  fingolimod  in  Japan.  Study  D1401  was  a  drug  use-results  survey  in 
Japanese  MS  patients  (all-case  surveillance)  that  started  in  November  2011  when  the  drug  was 
launched in Japan.  
In study D1401, a total 6,765 patients were enrolled. After removing the number of patients with 
multiple registration before and after hospital transfer, 6,642 patients as the actual number of patients 
enrolled. It was agreed with Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) that CRFs would be

collected from 1,792 patients who started treatment with fingolimod by May 31, 2013. Data from these 
1,792 patients were analyzed and reported in the CSR. Of these, there were 14 pediatric MS patients 
(defined as below 18 years of age at the study participation). 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The primary purpose of the study was to collect and evaluate information on the safety and efficacy of 
fingolimod in patients with multiple sclerosis under long-term clinical use in Japan 
Study population /Sample size 
The  overall  population  was  defined  as  one  consisting  of  patients  whose  CRFs  were  collected.  This 
population consisted of patients who received Gilenya/Imusera for the first time and patients who had 
a  history  of  use  of  an  investigational  drug/post-marketing  clinical  study  drug  containing  the  same 
active ingredient as Gilenya/Imusera.

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total 6,765 patients were enrolled. Of these, there were 14 pediatric MS patients (defined as below 
18 years of age at the study participation). 
Baseline data 
Patients  enrolled  in  the  study  D1401  included  14  pediatric  patients  (3  males  and  11  females)  with 
RRMS.  At  treatment  initiation,  these  patients  were  12-17  years  of  age  with  mean  and  median  age  of 
15.6  and  16,  respectively  and  a  mean/median  body  weight  of  53.3/50.4  kg  (no  patient  had  a 
bodyweight <40 kg).  
Seven  patients  completed  the  study  duration  of  2  years.  The  remaining  7  patients  discontinued  the 
study  due  to  reasons  as  reported  in  the  case  report  form  (CRF):  Adverse  event(s)  (2  patients),  this 
includes  lymphocyte  count  decrease  (non-serious)  and  optic  neuritis  (serious),  Lack  of  efficacy  (1 
patient), Transferred to another hospital (2 patients) or other (2 patients).

Efficacy results 
Summary of efficacy results 
The following sections present the descriptive data of the key efficacy measures of the survey (Clinical 
relapse,  Physician's  assessment  of  efficacy  and  Expanded  Disability  Status  Scale  (EDSS))  in  the  14 
pediatric patients. 
Annualized relapse rate 
Study  D1401  was  an  observational  study,  hence  no  confirmation  of  relapse  was  conducted  and  ARR 
were  calculated  based  on  ALL  relapses  as  reported  by  the  investigators.  In  the  14  pediatric  patients, 
before  the  start  of  treatment  with  fingolimod,  the  annualized  relapse  rate  (ARR)  was  1.93  (95% 
Confidence  interval  (CI)  1.33  -  2.81).  The  ARRs  at  12  months  and  24  months  after  treatment  with 
fingolimod were 0.52 (95% CI 0.24 - 1.13) and 0.35 (95% CI 0.17 - 0.71) respectively (Table 6-5).  
The Applicant concluded that due to the very limited number of patients, the observed ARR has a high 
variation, however the reduction of relapse activity after treatment was overall consistent to what has 
been observed in the pediatric Phase 3 trial D2311. 
Physician’s efficacy evaluations  
The study included an efficacy measure of physician’s evaluation, which is a comprehensive evaluation 
of  multiple  sclerosis  symptoms/findings  (considering  recurrence  rate/severity  of  recurrence,  EDSS, 
neurological findings, MRI findings, etc.) by the physician to categorize the patient as a “responder” or 
“non-responder”  to  fingolimod  treatment.  The  assessment  was  performed  at  the  time  points  of  6 
months, 12 months, 24 months and last observation after treatment with fingolimod. 
Of the 14 pediatric patients, 10, 9 and 8 patients at Months 6, 12 and 24 respectively, were assessed 
as “responders”. At Months 6, four patients were categorized as “not assessable”. No non-responders 
were identified at any time point (please refer to Table 6-6).

EDSS 
The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) evaluations were performed at the start of treatment with 
Gilenya/Imusera,  every  3  months  after  the  start  of  treatment  with  Gilenya/Imusera  and  treatment 
discontinuation based on expanded disability statuses of MS observed within routine care.  
Of the 8 pediatric patients for whom this assessment is available at the start of treatment, the mean 
EDSS  score  was  2.06  (median  1.75,  minimum  0  and  maximum  5.5),  the  average  EDSS  score 
throughout  the  survey  remained  in  the  range  of  0.92  –  1.44  with  fingolimod  treatment.  Of  note,  the 
number  of  patients  with  available  data  is  very  low;  however,  there  is  no  trend  of  worsening  in  EDSS 
over time (Table 6-7). 
Overall,  data  collected  from  these  limited  number  of  pediatric  patients,  in  an  observational  setting, 
showed  results  consistent  with  the  known  benefits  of  fingolimod  in  this  population  according  to  the 
applicant.

CHMP comments:  
This drug used study (CFTY720D1401 or D1401) was conducted only in Japan. This study is 
submitted in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006 and therefore only 
paediatric  patients  are  considered.  14  paediatric  patients  were  included  (3  males  and  11 
females) with RRMS. All these patients were between 12 and 17 year old at initiation. They 
were all with a body weight > 50 kg and were treated at the dose of 0,5 mg/day.  
Study  D1401  was  an  observational  study.  Some  efficacy  parameters  were  collected  at  6 
months,  1  year,  2  years  from  the  start  of  treatment  with  fingolimod:  relapse  rate,  EDSS, 
MRI findings. 
7/14 patients completed the study duration of 2 years. Reasons of discontinuation for the 7 
other patients were: Adverse event(s) (2 patients: this includes lymphocyte count decrease 
(non-serious)  and  optic  neuritis  (serious),  Lack  of  efficacy  (1  patient),  Transferred  to 
another hospital (2  patients)  or  other  (2  patients).  Of  note, 9  patients  were  treated  during 
one year.  
These  data  are  informative  only,  it  is  difficult  to  conclude  anything  regarding  efficacy 
considering  the  very  limited  number  of  Japanese  patients  and  the  design  of  the  study  e.g.  
open with no comparative arm.  
Overall  these  very  limited  data  are  consistent  with  efficacy  results  of  the  pivotal  study  in 
paediatric  patients  more  than  12  year-old  and  with  a  body  weight  >  50  kg  (PARADIGMS 
D2311) on MS relapse.  
Safety results 
The median exposure for these 14 patients was 626.5 days, the mean (min, max) exposure was 482.6 
(21, 720) days, 9 and 6 patients have exposure for at least 1 and 2 years, respectively. 
Adverse events 
8/14  pediatric  patients  reported  at  least  one  adverse  event.  The  most  frequently  affected  System 
organ  class  (SOCs)  were  Investigations  (4  (28.6%)  patients)  and  Nervous  system  disorders  (4 
(28.6%) patients) followed by respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (3 (21.4%) patients).

Serious adverse events 
Three  of  the  14  patients  experienced  SAEs.  Two  patients  reported  SAEs  under  the  SOC  of  nervous 
system disorders (preferred Term (PT) of Multiple sclerosis and Optic neuritis, respectively), 1 patient 
reported SAEs under the SOC of Investigations (PT Lymphocytes count decreased) (Table 6-10). 
There were no deaths reported in this group of 14 pediatric patients.  
CHMP comments:  
Analysis of PTs by SOC of adverse effects reported in the 14 pediatric patients retrieves mainly central 
nervous  system  adverse  effects,  non-serious  investigations  AE,  mainly  decreased  lymphocytes, 
respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. 
 The reported adverse events are consistent with the EU SmPC and the RMP of fingolimod. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This drug used study (CFTY720D1401 or D1401) was conducted only in Japan. This study is submitted 
in  accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No1901/2006  and  therefore  only  paediatric  patients 
are  considered.  14  paediatric  patients  were  included  (3  males  and  11  females)  with  RRMS.  All  these 
patients were between 12 and 17 year old at initiation. They were all with a body weight > 50 kg and 
were treated at the dose of 0,5 mg/day.  
Study  D1401  was  an  observational  study.  Some  efficacy  parameters  were  collected  at  6  months,  1 
year, 2 years from the start of treatment with fingolimod: relapse rate, EDSS, MRI findings. 
7/14 patients completed the study duration of 2 years. 9 patients were treated during one year.  
Considering the very limited number of Japanese patients and the design of the study e.g.  open study 
with no comparative arm, it is difficult to conclude anything regarding efficacy considering. 
Overall  these  very  limited  data  are  consistent  with  efficacy  and  safety  results  of  the  pivotal  study  in 
paediatric patients (PARADIGMS) on MS relapse.

To  remember,  D2311  study  enrolled  patients  from  10  to  18  years  old.  The  number  of  patients  aged 
10-12  years,  with  a  weight  <40  kg  and  /  or  pre-pubertal  (<2  Tanner  stage  scoring)  enrolled  in  this 
study  was  underrepresented.    Further  long  term  safety  data  was  requested  especially  in  this  specific 
population. No new information was reported in this D1401 study since the 14 patients were more than 
12-year-old and > 40 kg.  
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
This Japanese open drug use study is submitted in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation 
(EC)  No1901/2006  and  therefore  only  paediatric  patients  are  considered.  14  MS  paediatric 
patients were included: these patients were between 12 and 17 year old at initiation with a 
body weight > 50 kg and were treated at the dose of 0,5 mg/day. 7/14 patients completed 
the  study  duration  of  2  years.  9  patients  were  treated  during  one  year. Data  are  therefore 
limited.  No  new  information  was  reported  regarding  the  14  patients  observation  in  this  drug  use 
study.  
The benefit/risk balance of Gilenya remains positive in the approved indications. 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

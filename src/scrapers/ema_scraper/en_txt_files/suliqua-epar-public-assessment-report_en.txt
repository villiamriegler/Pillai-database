2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by a gradual deterioration in β cell function; this occurs even when 
standard-of-care antidiabetic therapy is used, including concurrent use of multiple oral antidiabetic drugs 
(OADs). Since T2DM is phenotypically heterogeneous, e.g., race/ethnicity, age at onset, duration of disease, 
body weight, comorbidities, and deficits in fasting versus postprandial hyperglycaemia, these phenotypic 
variables significantly influence the choice of anti-hyperglycaemic therapy. In the last decade, several new 
therapeutic classes have become available, enabling a patient-centred rather than one-size-fits-all approach 
and moving T2DM management towards appropriate dual therapy at an earlier point in the disease continuum. 
The timely introduction of basal insulin to intensify treatment in patients with T2DM insufficiently controlled on 
OADs has been recommended by the American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of 
Diabetes (ADA/EASD) since 2006. Although metformin remains the consensus first-line drug in newly diagnosed 
patients without symptoms of significant hyperglycaemia, GLP-1 receptor agonists are recommended as part of 
metformin-based dual and triple therapy after failure of metformin monotherapy per the ADA/EASD 2015 
position statement. 
For patients insufficiently controlled on one or more OADs, initiation of insulin treatment is often delayed due to 
clinical inertia. In a retrospective study published in 2014 of more than 50 000 patients with T2DM in the United 
States, 4 out of 5 patients not achieving glycaemic control on dual oral therapy were prescribed another OAD 
rather than insulin. Another recent retrospective cohort study followed more than 80 000 patients with T2DM up 
to 2011; maximum follow-up was 7.3 years. The median time to insulin intensification in patients with HbA1c 
≥7.0% taking 2 or 3 OADs was >7 years. Physician reluctance to initiate insulin therapy, often due to concerns 
about hypoglycaemia and weight gain, thus contributes to prolonged periods of sustained hyperglycaemia. 
Patients with insufficiently controlled T2DM already on basal insulin represent an additional unmet need. Dual 
therapy with a GLP-1 receptor agonist and basal insulin (injected separately), based on the original findings 
reported for exenatide by Buse et al (2011) and recently confirmed for lixisenatide, has been added as an 
antidiabetic treatment option. The 2015 ADA/EASD T2DM position statement recommends that if glucose 
control remains poor despite the use of basal insulin with one or more oral agents, either a GLP-1 receptor 
agonist or prandial insulin can be added. The guideline states further that “The available data now suggest that 
either a GLP-1 receptor agonist or prandial insulin could be used in this setting, with the former arguably safer, 
at least for short-term outcomes. The addition of a GLP-1 receptor agonist or mealtime insulin could be viewed 
as a logical progression of the treatment regimen, the former perhaps a more attractive option in more obese 
individuals or in those who may not have the capacity to handle the complexities of a multi-dose insulin 
regimen.” 
The fixed-ratio combination (FRC) of insulin glargine (100 U/mL) with lixisenatide is intended for the treatment 
of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to improve glycaemic control in combination with oral 
glucose-lowering medicinal products when these alone or combined with basal insulin, or basal insulin alone do 
not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
The fixed-ratio combination is intended to be administered subcutaneously once a day within 1 hour prior to any 
meal of the day. 
The FRC could provide a benefit to patients since simultaneous once-daily injection of a dual 
anti-hyperglycaemic therapy may improve treatment compliance. This in turn could allow more patients to 
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016 
Page 8/113 
  
  
reach glycaemic goals without increasing safety or tolerability risks. The FRC is appropriate both for patients 
beginning insulin-based treatment and those already on established basal insulin.  
The development program includes two pivotal phase III studies which include a total of 1906 patients with 
T2DM. Both studies were of 30 weeks duration. 
The development program is in all essentials in line with the Guideline on Clinical Development of Fixed 
Combination Medicinal Products (CHMP/EWP/240/95 Rev. 1). 
Suliqua is a fixed ratio combination between the basal insulin glargine and the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) 
analogue lixisenatide. Both individual components have been approved previously in the EU, insulin glargine as 
Lantus (2000) and lixisenatide as Lyxumia (2013). Suliqua is available as solution for injection and provided in 
two different prefilled pens with constant ratios between the two substances (the 10-40 pen with a ratio of 2U 
insulin glargine/1 µg lixisenatide and the 30-60 pen with a ratio of 3U insulin glargine/1 µg lixisenatide). It is 
intended to be used for once-daily parenteral administration. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product Suliqua is a fixed ratio combination (FRC) consisting of insulin glargine and lixisenatide, 
being proposed for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  
The finished product is presented as an aqueous, sterile, clear and colourless solution containing 100 units/ml of 
insulin glargine and lixisenatide (50 microgram/ml or 33 microgram/ml) as active substances, for once-daily 
subcutaneous  injection.  The  finished  product  is  available  in  a  Type  I  colourless  glass  cartridge  with  a  black 
plunger (bromobutyl rubber) and a flanged cap (aluminium) with inserted laminated sealing disks (bromobutyl 
rubber  on  the  medicinal  product  side  and  polyisoprene  on  the  outside)  containing  3  mL  of  solution.  Each 
cartridge is assembled into a disposable pen. The pen-injector is designed to deliver multiple doses of variable 
volume and was based on the already marketed SoloStar® pen-injector.  
To maximize the range of insulin glargine and concomitantly deliver lixisenatide to approximate its maximum 
clinical dose, two different strengths have been developed (2 different dose ratios): 
-  10-40  prefilled  pen:  solution  for  injection  containing  100  U/ml  insulin  glargine  and  50  mcg/ml 
lixisenatide (ratio of 2 U insulin glargine/1 mcg lixisenatide). The pen delivers doses from 10 to 40 U in 
steps of 1 unit, allowing administration of FRC doses between 10 U/5 mcg and 40 U/20 mcg. 
-  30-60 prefilled pen solution for injection containing 100 U/ml insulin glargine and 33 mcg/ml lixisenatide 
(ratio of 3 U insulin glargine/1 mcg lixisenatide). The pen delivers doses from 30 to 60 U in steps of 1 
unit, allowing administration of FRC doses between 30 U/10 mcg and 60 U/20 mcg. 
The caps and bodies of the two strengths of the insulin glargine / lixisenatide pen-injectors feature different 
colors: peach for pen A and olive for pen B. In addition, the injection buttons of both pens are also colored 
differently:  orange  (pen  A)  and  dark  orange  (pen  B).  Apart  from  colors  and  mechanical  parts  pertaining  to 
different dose strengths, the overall geometry and function of each pen variant is identical.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Both active substances are already approved as part of mono-component centralised marketing authorisations; 
Lantus  (insulin  glargine)  held  by  Sanofi-Aventis  Deutschland  GmbH,  and  Lyxumia  (lixisenatide)  held  by 
sanofi-aventis groupe. The active substance manufacturing processes and controls presented for Suliqua are in 
line with those approved for the mono-component products. Further detail is elaborated below. 
General Information  
The  active  substance  insulin  glargine  is  a  human  insulin  analogue  produced  by  means  of  recombinant  DNA 
technology in E. coli. It is a protein consisting of 2 chains: the A-chain containing 21 amino acids and the B-chain 
containing  32  amino  acids.  In  comparison  to  insulin  human,  asparagine  is  substituted  by  glycine  at  the 
C-terminal end of the A-chain and two arginines are added to the C-terminal end of the B-chain. The A- and 
B-chains are linked by 2 interchain disulfide bonds and the A-chain contains one intrachain disulfide bond. There 
are no other post-translational modifications. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Insulin  glargine  is  produced  by  recombinant  DNA  technology  in  E.  coli  as  a  fusion  protein  containing  a 
pre-sequence (to protect against proteolytic degradation) and the pro-insulin sequence from a primate which is 
modified resulting in insulin glargine.  
The insulin glargine active substance manufacturing process has been adequately described. The main steps are 
fermentation, recovery, purification, crystallisation and drying. The ranges of critical process parameters and 
the routine in-process controls along with acceptance criteria are described for each step. The active substance 
manufacturing process is considered acceptable.  
The  manufacturing  process  of  the  active  substance  comprises  a  number  of  steps  in  which  the  protein  is 
expressed  in  E.  coli  bacteria  (pre-fermentation  and  main  fermentation),  recovered  (disruption  of  cells  and 
inclusion  bodies,  isolation  of  fusion  protein  by  continuous  centrifugation,  folding  and  precipitation  of 
by-products,  tryptic  cleavage  of  prepro-sequence  from  fusion  protein),  purified  (various  purification  and 
chromatographic steps), crystallised and dried.  
The  in-process  controls  include  parameters  and  limits  for  fermentation  in  the  upstream  process  (such  as 
pressure,  aeration,  oxygen  pressure,  pH,  glucose  concentration,  temperature,  stirring,  total  weight)  and  for 
purification  steps  in  the  downstream  process  (such  as  content  of  insulin  glargine  and  by-products  and  step 
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016

yields). These were considered acceptable based on the results from manufacturing development/experience 
and process validation provided by the applicant. 
A seeding culture is prepared by inoculation with one ampoule of the working seed bank and transferred to the 
first bioreactor with medium for amplification. The material from this pre-fermentation step is transferred into 
the  next  bioreactor  with  medium  for  the  main  fermentation,  including  the  production  phase.  At  the  end  of 
fermentation, the cells are inactivated and then separated for the following isolation of fusion protein. Thus 
material from a single ampoule is amplified and processed to give one harvest of cells with fusion protein. 
Usually, the harvest from one fermentation run is processed downstream to give one batch of insulin glargine. 
Samples are taken and the product is filled into containers of stainless steel, which are immediately labelled and 
transferred to the freezing room for storage at -20°C ± 5°C.  
This manufacturing process takes place at Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH in Germany in two facilities (i.e. 
the so-called Lantus Plant and Multi-Insulin Building (MIB) facilities) and is well defined and overall considered 
adequately controlled. 
Control of materials 
Sufficiently detailed information is provided on the raw materials used for the production of insulin glargine. No 
antibiotics  or  human/animal  derived  materials  are  used  in  the  active  substance  manufacturing  process  and 
acceptable documents have been provided for raw materials of biological origin used in the establishment of cell 
substrate. The host cell strain E. coli K12 has been thoroughly characterised with regard to physiological tests, 
bacteriophage test, ELISA and genetic tests.  
A two tiered cell banking system is used and sufficient information is provided regarding testing of MCB and WCB 
and release of future WCBs. Both the MCB and two WCBs are fully characterised in accordance with ICH Q5B and 
Q5D  guidelines  with  regard  to  identity,  phenotypic  characteristics,  growth  characteristics,  viable  cell  count, 
plasmid identity, plasmid retention, plasmid copy number, expression of fusion protein, verification of coding 
sequence, microbial contamination.  
In addition, genetic stability for end of production cells has been verified through extended fermentation runs at 
final production scale. Genetic and storage stability of the production cell line has been addressed for the MCB 
and first WCB. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Adequate limits are set for the in-process controls by which correct performance of fermentation is confirmed. 
The fusion protein isolated from the cell paste, is enriched by re-suspension and centrifugation steps and then 
combined with cysteine which prevents the growth of potential microbial contaminants. Downstream processing 
of  the  fusion  protein  to  insulin  glargine  is  a  sequence  of  modification  and  efficient  purification  steps.  Each 
intermediate is enriched or purified to a quality which is suitable for the next step. 
A full description of the in-process controls (IPCs) is provided in Section 3.2.S.2.4 Control of critical steps and 
intermediates, including an overview for the critical process parameters and the in-process controls for each 
step of the manufacturing process, together with acceptance criteria and justifications. 
Several intermediates are formed during the manufacturing process, for which normal and maximal storage 
periods are defined. Supporting validation data to substantiate these storage claims for all intermediates are 
provided.

Process validation 
Process validation data are presented for consecutive production scale batches. The results from the process 
and  product  parameters  controlled,  together  with  process  development  history  and  experience,  and  batch 
release  results  demonstrate  that  the  established  manufacturing  process  is  capable  of  yielding  a  product  of 
appropriate quality. In addition, the purification process shows a good consistency in the elimination of both 
process-related and product-related impurities. 
Manufacturing process development 
The manufacturing process development is described in detail from the beginning of development up to the 
latest changes introduced. Each step of the manufacturing process has been thoroughly discussed with regard 
to  the  establishment  and  optimization  of  all  process  and/or  product  parameters  involved  in  order to  yield  a 
product of high (or increased) quality. All batches used in clinical studies, non-clinical studies, development, 
pilot  and  production  scale  manufacturing  have  been  stated  in  clear overviews.  All  results  complied  with  the 
acceptance criteria and batches manufactured revealed no significant difference. The quality of insulin glargine 
active substance manufactured at both facilities is thus guaranteed.  
Characterisation 
The  insulin  glargine  active  substance  has  been  sufficiently  characterised  by  physicochemical  and  biological 
state-of-the-art  methods.  The  analytical  results  are  consistent  with  the  proposed  structure.  The  methods 
addressed  the  molecular  mass,  primary  structure,  secondary  and  tertiary  structures,  crystal  structure  and 
several  physicochemical  parameters,  i.e.  isoelectric  point,  solubility  in  aqueous  medium,  influence  of  pH  on 
structure and effect of zinc concentration on hexamer formation. The absence of a potency assay was acceptable 
as the active substance is well characterised and already approved as part of the centralised product, Lantus. 
Overall, a detailed and sufficient characterisation of the active substance has been made. With regard to the 
product- and process-related impurities, these are considered sufficiently addressed and controlled. 
Specification 
Specifications have been  established for insulin glargine and are considered appropriate to ensure sufficient 
quality with regard to appearance, identity, purity/impurities, quantity, microbiological quality and endotoxins. 
There were no changes made to the proposed specification during the procedure. The acceptance limits are in 
compliance with the Ph. Eur. monograph 2571 for insulin glargine.  
Analytical Methods 
All  the  analytical  methods  used  are  those  published  in  the  Ph.  Eur.  monograph  of  insulin  glargine  (current 
edition) except the ILA for the quantification of E. coli proteins, which is sufficiently described. The test methods 
chosen are considered acceptable. Additionally, validation data are supplemented for the test for microbiological 
content and bacterial endotoxins according to Ph. Eur. requirements. 
Batch Analysis 
The specifications are justified based on batch analysis data of 10 release batches and 3 stability batches. The 
results are within the specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process. 
Reference Materials 
The compendial insulin glargine reference standard is applied for testing the active substance batches. An insulin 
glargine  active  substance  batch  can  be  calibrated  as  secondary  reference  standard  against  the  compendial 
standard. Qualification of such a batch is performed according to the control tests and specifications for the 
Assessment report

active substance. In addition, calibration against the official compendial standards is performed periodically. An 
overview of the reference batches used to date is also provided. 
Stability 
The stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable and justify the proposed shelf life of 
24 months stored in an airtight container (steel drum), protected from light, at a temperature between -25 °C 
and -15 °C. 
Stability results from 3 batches stored under long term (-20 °C ± 5 °C) and accelerated (+5 °C ± 3 °C) storage 
conditions  show  a  good  stability  profile  for  the  active  substance.  All  parameters  remained  stable  over  time 
except for a slight increase in water content. The representativeness of the container closure system used during 
stability studies compared to the one used in routine production and storage is demonstrated in a comparative 
stability study of primary packaging material. The suitability of the primary packaging material for the active 
substance insulin glargine is considered demonstrated. In addition, it is acknowledged that the smaller volume 
containers represent worst case conditions with respect to product-container contact. An ICH Q1B photostability 
study revealed that insulin glargine is sensitive to light exposure.  
The claimed shelf-life period of 24 months for the active substance insulin glargine at the recommended storage 
conditions (i.e. store in an airtight container, protected from light, at a temperature between -25 °C and -15 °C) 
is supported. 
LIXISENATIDE 
An ASMF procedure is used for the active substance lixisenatide. The documentation provided in this Suliqua 
application is identical to that currently approved for Lyxumia. 
General Information 
Lixisenatide is a peptide containing 44 amino acids, which is amidated at the C-terminal AA (position 44). The 
sequence of the amino acids has been provided.  
General properties such as physical characteristics (amorphous, hygroscopic, white to off-white powder), 
melting point, pH, IR, and UV analysis of the peptide (in accordance with the structure), solubility, 
stereochemistry (pure L-form) were presented. Polymorphism has not been observed.  
It is white to off-white amorphous powder, freely soluble in water and hygroscopic. Lixisenatide is 
photosensitive, when exposed to intensive light. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The manufacturing process of lixisenatide drug substance is a standard solid phase peptide synthesis and 
consists of multiple synthetic steps, followed by purification and lyophilisation. A flow diagram and a 
comprehensive narrative description of the process have been presented.  
Further information on the manufacturing process and process controls is provided in the restricted part of the 
Active Substance Master File.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. Satisfactory specifications and control methods 
for starting materials, reagents and intermediates were presented.  
Details regarding specifications, analytical procedures, validation and batch results applied to intermediates and 
starting materials are found in the restricted part of the Active Substance Master File.  
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016

The structure of lixisenatide was elucidated using the following methods: Mass spectrometry (MS), Peptide 
mapping, Amino acid analysis, Amino acid sequencing (Edman sequencing technique). In addition, lixisenatide 
was investigated by: Infra-red (FT-IR) absorption spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet- visible absorption (UV) 
spectrophotometry, X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and Nuclear 
magnetic resonance (NMR)-spectroscopy.  
Furthermore, the functionality of lixisenatide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, was determined using a cell-based 
potency bioassay. The suitability of the bioassay method was investigated extensively and found suitable. The 
bioassay shows an adequate correlation with the HPLC results of the assay determination however the HPLC 
method is considered superior for routine testing.  
A  comprehensive  discussion  is  presented  on  impurities  (including  isomers,  degradation  products,  genotoxic 
impurities, leachables and extractables, residual solvents) of lixisenatide determined by HPLC. The impurities 
were found below the qualification levels in line with ICH guidance and did not raise any toxicological concern. 
Specification 
The specification for lixisenatide includes the following tests and acceptance criteria to assure consistent quality 
of the active substance: appearance of the active substance (visual), identification (amino acid sequencing by 
Edman  method),  mass  identification  (Ph.Eur.),  assay  lixisenatide  (HPLC),  related  substances  (HPLC  and 
HPLC-MS), high molecular weight proteins (HPSEC),  Chiral purity (AAA-GC), residual trifluoroacetic acid TFA 
(HPLC),  acetate  content  (HPLC),  residual  solvents  (GC),  water  content  (Karl-Fisher),  microbial  examination 
(Ph.Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph.Eur.). The specification was adequately justified including the absence of 
certain tests such as the cell-based bioassay in the routine controls. 
The analytical methods used are fully described. The methods are validated and they are suitable for their intend 
use. 
Batch analysis data (22 of batches, including 3 production scale) of the active substance were provided. The 
results are within the specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process. 
Information  regarding  the  reference  standards  used  for  assay  and  impurities  testing  has  been  presented, 
together with certificates of analysis of reference materials for the related substances used in the validation of 
the analytical methods. 
Lixisenatide  active  substance  is  packed  into  amber glass  bottles  with  airtight closing  screw  caps.  Due  to  its 
sensitivity to light, lixisenatide has to be protected from light. This is assured by the primary packaging. The 
packaging materials comply with the Ph. Eur. monograph on glass containers for pharmaceutical use (Ph. Eur. 
3.2.1) and Commission Directive 2002/72/EC, relating to plastic materials and articles intended to come into 
contact with foodstuffs. The specifications of the components are provided. 
Stability 
The stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable and justify the proposed retest period 
of 60 months when stored at -20°C ±5°C in the proposed container. 
Stability data are available for 3 stability commercial scale batches of active substance from the commercial 
manufacturing  process  through  60  months  of  storage  at  -20°C±5°C  in  the  intended  container.  In  addition, 
stability data are also available for 3 production batches of active substance from the commercial manufacturing

process through 48 months of storage for 2 batches and 60 months of storage for one batch at -20°C±5°C in the 
intended container.  
The following parameters were tested:  
•  Appearance of the drug substance (visual)  
•  Assay lixisenatide (HPLC 1)  
•  Related impurities 1 (HPLC 1)  
•  High molecular weight proteins (HPSEC)  
•  Water content (Karl Fischer).  
The  analytical  methods  used  were  the  same  as  for  release  and  were  stability  indicating.    The  test  results 
demonstrate the adherence to the limits of the stability-relevant control tests. All results are in compliance with 
the specifications. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. The photostability studies 
showed that lixisenatide is photosensitive when exposed to intense light. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 60 months when stored at -20°C ±5°C in the 
proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of product and Pharmaceutical development 
Suliqua is an aqueous, sterile, clear and colourless solution for once-daily subcutaneous injection. The finished 
product contains insulin glargine and lixisenatide and the following excipients: glycerol, methionine, metacresol, 
zinc chloride, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide and water for injection.  
The finished product is available in two strengths;  
•  3.64 mg/mL insulin glargine [equivalent to 100 U of insulin glargine] with 50 mcg/mL lixisenatide  
•  3.64 mg/mL insulin glargine [equivalent to 100 U of insulin glargine] with 33 mcg/mL lixisenatide.  
All  excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical  ingredients  and  their  quality  complies  with  Ph.Eur.  standards. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation.  
It is packed in Type I colourless glass cartridges with a black plunger (bromobutyl rubber) and a flanged cap 
(aluminium)  with  inserted  laminated  sealing  disks  (bromobutyl  rubber  on  the  medicinal  product  side  and 
polyisoprene  on  the  outside)  containing  3  mL  of  solution.  Closures  comply  with  Ph.  Eur.The  cartridge  is 
irreversibly  integrated  in  a  disposable  mechanical  pen-injector  for  self-administration  by  the  patient.  The 
pen-injector is designed to deliver multiple doses of variable volume and was based on the already marketed 
SoloStar® pen-injector, which is approved as part of the mono-component insulin glargine product, Lantus. Each 
dose strength has its own pen-injector of different colour, which is deemed suitable to avoid confusion. The pens 
and cartridges were investigated with respect to performance according to the applicable ISO standards and 
passed all criteria assessed under the investigations. 
The finished product intended for commercialization was manufactured with the same composition (apart from 
the dosage strengths for lixisenatide and insulin glargine) as the products used throughout clinical development. 
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016 
Page 15/113 
  
  
Pharmaceutical development 
The mono-preparations of respectively, insulin glargine and lixisenatide, are already approved. Therefore the 
development of the combination product was based on previous experience with the mono-preparations. A pH 
of 4.5 was demonstrated to be suitable, metacresol is added as preservative, glycerol for tonicity, zinc chloride 
to stabilise insulin glargine and methionine to stabilise lixisenatide. All excipients are of Ph. Eur. quality and are 
tested according to their respective monographs. 
For the clinical programs, mono-preparations were administered separately, combination products were mixed 
directly  prior  to  administration  and  different  combination  products  were  administered.  Throughout  clinical 
development, the combination product was manufactured with the same composition (apart from the dosage 
strengths for lixisenatide and insulin glargine) as the finished product intended for commercialization. 
Development of Suliqua was based on the marketed formulations for insulin glargine solution for injection 100 
U/mL in cartridges and lixisenatide solution for injection 50 or 100 μg/ml.  
During  development,  the  critical  quality  attributes  were  defined  and  the  physical/chemical  stability  of  the 
combined product was investigated. 
Manufacturing process development has been adequately described, and critical process parameters identified.  
The  concentration  of  metacresol  was  selected  and  justified  by  the  results  of  the  efficacy  of  antimicrobial 
preservation testing. 
The container closure system already in use for both mono formulations was selected and the suitability of the 
cartridges in combination with insulin glargine/lixisenatide solution for injection was successfully demonstrated 
in extractables and leachables studies. 
The  description  of  the  pharmaceutical  development  of  the  insulin  glargine/lixisenatide  pen-injector  is  well 
documented  and  raises  no  cause  for  concern.  The  results  of  the  user  consultation  of  the  insulin 
glargine/lixisenatide package leaflets are also provided. 
Manufacture of product and process controls 
The manufacture, assembly of the disposable pen-injector, testing, primary & secondary packaging, labelling, 
stability testing, and release has been sufficiently described and validated.  
The manufacturing process of the Suliqua finished product includes compounding, pH adjustment, pre-filtration, 
sterile filtration, filling in cartridges, assembly in the pen-injectors and packaging.  
The  manufacturing  process  is  considered  to  be  adequately  described  and  relevant  in-process  controls  are 
performed.  The  efficacy  of  aseptic  processing,  including  validation  by  sterile  medial  fills,  has  been 
demonstrated.  The  manufacturing  process  has  been  validated.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the 
manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner.  
Product specification 
The  specifications  for  insulin  glargine/lixisenatide  solution  for  injection  include  tests  for  appearance, 
identification  of  actives  (HPLC,  HPSEC),  assay  of  actives  (HPLC),  related  impurities/degradation  products 
(HPLC), pH (potentiometry),   sterility (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), particulate matter (Ph. Eur.), 
antimicrobial  preservative  assay  (HPLC),  assay  of  zinc  (AAS),  assay  of  methionine  (HPLC)  and  extractable 
volume (Ph. Eur.).

The appearance and identification (visual), functional test and dose accuracy of the 
pen-injector (gravimetry/optical measurement) are also tested. 
The specifications for insulin glargine/lixisenatide solution for injection, 100 U/mL insulin glargine with 50 or 33 
μg/mL  lixisenatide  –  performed  with  cartridge  are  based  on  batch  analyses  of  several  batches  of  insulin 
glargine/lixisenatide finished product prepared by the commercial process (three batches of each strength), and 
five batches used for clinical and toxicological, stability data.  
The specifications used for the control of insulin glargine/lixisenatide solution for injection were selected on the 
basis  of  the  available  manufacturing  and  testing  experience,  manufacturing  process  capabilities,  regulatory 
guidance, scientific knowledge, and the stability characteristics. 
Appropriate  data  have  been  presented  to  justify  the  specifications  for  each  quality  characteristic  that  is 
controlled.  
Analytical methods 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  (non-compendial  methods)  appropriately 
validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
The validation studies also confirm the suitability of analytical methods for the determination of both sterility and 
bacterial endotoxins in insulin glargine/lixisenatide solution for injection. 
Batch analysis 
The provided data are issued from 5 batches used in clinical development (3 x 50 µg and 2 x 22 µg lixisenatide) 
and 6 representative batches (3 x 50 µg and 3 x 33 µg). All parameters comply with the specification and confirm 
the consistency of the manufacturing process. 
Reference materials 
Satisfactory  information  regarding  the  reference  standards  used  for  assay  and  impurities  testing  has  been 
presented. 
Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf-life of 24 months when the pens are stored in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C) with an in-use shelf 
life of 14 days when stored below 30°C, are considered acceptable. 
Stability data generated at long-term (5°C±3°C) and accelerated (25°C±2°C/60%±5% RH) storage conditions 
are  provided  for  3  batches  of  each  strength  of  Suliqua  in  the  cartridges  and  one  batch  of  each  strength 
assembled in the pen injector up to 24 months and 6 months, respectively.  
The parameters tested were the same as for release, with the exception of the identification tests. Data from 
photostability testing (according to ICH Q1B Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and 
Products) and stress testing (at 40°C±2°C/75%±5% RH for one month) are provided for each of these batches. 
In-use stability data are also provided on two batches of each strength of Suliqua tested after storage for 6, 12 
and 24 months at long term storage conditions. The data provided are within the proposed specification.

The submitted stability package supports the proposed shelf-life of 24 months when the pens are stored in a 
refrigerator (2°C - 8°C) with an in-use shelf life of 14 days when stored below 30°C. 
Adventitious agents 
The risk of potential contamination with adventitious agents in the finished product is deemed very low.  
Viral safety 
It is considered that no significant risk of contamination with adventitious agents such as mammalian viruses or 
mycoplasma can be derived from the manufacturing process of starting materials. Therefore, viral clearance 
studies have not been performed, which is acceptable since no human or animal cell lines are used.  
TSE safety 
No animal or human derived material is used during the manufacture of the insulin glargine and lixisenatide 
active substances and the final finished product. Furthermore, it is also declared that both active substances are 
manufactured in accordance with the note for guidance on minimising the TSE risk (EMEA/410/01). 
Taking into account the nature of the product, sufficient information is presented with regard to the risk for 
potential contamination with adventitious agents in terms of control of materials, control of production process, 
certification of materials of animal origin and testing of active substance and finished product. These controls 
make the risk of adventitious agents contamination negligible. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
There were no major objections on quality aspects identified by the CHMP. The CHMP raised a number of other 
concerns on quality aspects. These were all satisfactorily answered by the applicant during the procedure. 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The control applied to the finished product, along with the controls over the 
manufacturing process of the finished product, support that the product insulin glargine / lixisenatide solution 
for injection can be routinely manufactured to conform to the current expectations for this type of dosage form. 
There are no recommendations for future quality development. 
Furthermore, the stability data submitted supports that both the active substance and the product will remain of 
the appropriate quality when stored as recommended storage conditions throughout the proposed re-test period 
of 48 months for Insulin glargine and 60 months for lixisenatide and a shelf-life of 24 months, for the finished 
products plus 14 day in-use period. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical package of Suliqua refers to the non-clinical studies conducted with the individual components 
insulin glargine and lixisenatide that have each undergone complete nonclinical development programs as part 
of their original marketing authorization application in the EU for the treatment of T2DM under the name 
Lantus/Optisulin and Lyxumia, respectively. 
In support of the application of Suliqua, the following non-clinical studies were further conducted by the 
Applicant with the insulin glargine/lixisenatide fixed ratio combination: 
•  A series of in vitro pharmacology studies evaluating the effects of the combination on the binding and 
activation of the IGF-1R, INSR and GLP-1 R receptors, on cell apoptosis as well as on cell proliferation.  
• 
Primary pharmacodynamics studies assessing the effects of the combination insulin glargine/lixisenatide on 
glucose homeostasis in a mouse disease model of diabetes as well as following a glucose oral tolerance test 
in normoglycemic dogs. 
•  A cardiovascular safety pharmacology study conducted in the anesthetized dog model with insulin 
glargine/lixisenatide IV co-administration. 
•  A study on the PK parameter of insulin glargine and lixisenatide in the dog following a single SC 
administration of the combination. 
• 
Two local tolerance studies with the insulin glargine/lixisenatide combination in New Zealand White Rabbits. 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology  
In vitro studies were mainly performed in 1.1B4 cells, identified to simultaneously express mRNA of GLP-1R, 
IGF1R and INSR, and the rat thyroid c-cell line RTC6-23, previously shown to co-express functionally active 
GLP-1R and INSR. No interaction in cellular signalling between lixisenatide and insulin glargine was indicated up 
to a concentration of 1 nM of the insulin when cAMP formation was measured in RTC 6-23 cells. At 1 μM of insulin 
glargine (the highest concentration applied), a slight synergism between lixisenatide and insulin glargine 
became apparent. Lixisenatide did not possess AKT stimulatory activity in RTC6-23 or 1.1B4 cells and did not 
influence AKT phosphorylation induced by insulin, insulin glargine or the insulin glargine M1-metabolite. 
Furthermore, Lixisenatide was shown to be a potent ligand of the human GLP-1R with an IC50 value of 1.43 nM 
while insulin glargine at a concentration of 100 nM didn’t show affinity to the GLP-1 receptor. On the other hand, 
Lixisenatide did not possess binding affinity to IR-B, did not influence the affinity of insulin glargine to IR-B and 
did not affect IR-auto phosphorylation or the activity of insulin glargine on IR. Lixisenatide neither possessed an 
activity for IGF1R nor an influence on the activity of insulin glargine on IGF1R. No interaction between 
lixisenatide and insulin glargine was thus indicated in the in vitro studies performed with the insulin 
glargine/lixisenatide combination at the level of their specific receptor or receptor downstream signalling. 
There was a strong signalling through the GIP receptor by native GIP in the rat (RTC6-23) and human (TT) 
thyroid C-cell carcinoma cell lines, while signalling through the GLP-1 receptor by the four GLP-1 receptor 
agonists was only strong in the rat C-cell line and weak in the human C-cell line. These findings are said to 
further support the conclusion that GLP-1 receptor-mediated C-cell proliferation in rodents after long-term 
exposure of high concentrations of GLP-1 receptor agonists might be a rodent-specific phenomenon and not 
relevant for humans. 
Lixisenatide did not induce any relevant modulation of the TNF alpha mediated apoptotic signalling pathway in 
rat RTC 6-23 cells, while a weak anti-apoptotic property of insulin glargine was detected at 1nM and 1μM. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016 
Page 19/113 
  
  
combination was comparable to the single dose treatment. In the human pancreatic beta cell line 1.1B4, treated 
with the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFalpha /IL-ß and INF-gamma, lixisenatide induced a dose dependent 
reduction of apoptosis both alone (EC50=2.64 pM) and in presence of 1nM (IC50 = 2.89 pM) and 1μM (IC50 = 
2.40 pM) insulin glargine, while insulin glargine alone (at 1pM, 1nM or 1μM) was not able to modulate caspase 
activity. No synergistic and/or additive anti-apoptotic effect for the combination of lixisenatide and insulin 
glargine was thus detectable in RTC 6-23 cells following treatment with the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF 
alpha or in the human pancreatic beta cell line 1.1B4, treated with the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFalpha 
/IL-ß and INF-gamma. 
The proliferative effect of insulin glargine and lixisenatide and possible interactions of the combination was 
investigated in the human pancreatic beta cell line 1.1B4. Insulin and insulin glargine induced 14C-thymidine 
incorporation in a dose-dependent manner with EC50 9.41nM and 0.996 nM, respectively, while lixisenatide 
alone did not show any effects on 14C-thymidine incorporation (no EC50 values reported). The combination of 
insulin glargine/lixisenatide displayed comparable incorporation of 14C-thymidine as compared to insulin 
glargine alone (EC50 0.775 nM as compared to 0.996 nM). No interaction between lixisenatide and insulin 
glargine was thus either indicated in the in vitro studies on apoptosis or cell proliferation. 
In db/db mice the lixisenatide/insulin glargine combination was indicated to be more effective than insulin 
glargine alone and decreased blood glucose levels to close normal physiological values. In an OGTT (also in 
db/db mice) treatment with the insulin glargine/lixisenatide combination was significantly more efficacious 
versus lixisenatide and insulin glargine alone during the absorptive phase and further reduced blood glucose 
during the postabsorptive phase compared to placebo-treated control mice. When lixisenatide and insulin 
glargine were given in combination to Beagle dogs the combination was at least similar to the effects of 
lixisenatide and insulin glargine monotherapy and there was a decrease of blood glucose levels during both the 
absorptive and postabsorptive phases of the OGTT similar to that of lixisenatide alone during the absorptive 
phase and to insulin glargine during the postabsorptive phase. Differences between two strengths of insulin 
glargine in combination was also observed, suggested to reflect an improved long term performance of the 300 
U/mL compared to the 100 U/mL formulation. The lixisenatide/insulin glargine combination did not increase 
insulin glargine’s effect on blood glucose during the postabsorptive phase in dogs and the combination thus did 
not seem to increase the risk for hypoglycaemia. 
A cardiovascular safety pharmacology study was conducted in anesthetized dogs with insulin 
glargine/lixisenatide IV co-administration. Both compounds, when given together, did not modify the effects 
observed with insulin glargine alone, as there was similar maximal hypoglycemia, similar effect on plasma 
potassium concomitant with an increased QT interval and changes in T wave morphology. No additional risk was 
thus identified when both compounds were co-administered, compared to treatment of insulin glargine or 
lixisenatide individually. 
No other Safety Pharmacology studies or studies on Secondary Pharmacodynamics or Pharmacodynamic drug 
interactions have been performed with the combination. This is considered acceptable. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Following SC administration of a combination of insulin glargine and lixisenatide to dogs, the exposure 
(AUC0-8h) to insulin glargine-M1 was not affected by the presence of lixisenatide in the injection solution. 
Maximum concentration (Cmax) and exposure (AUC0-8h) of lixisenatide were not significantly impacted by 
insulin glargine. The plasma half-lives of lixisenatide were significantly shorter (1.1 hours; p<0.05) after 
coadministration with insulin glargine as compared with the plasma half-life seen after administration of 
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016 
Page 20/113 
  
  
lixisenatide alone (1.9 hours). Since the PK of lixisenatide is absorption-controlled, this result is suggestive of a 
shortened absorption period of lixisenatide in the presence of insulin glargine. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
Full nonclinical programs of toxicology studies for the individual compounds were submitted and reviewed as 
part of the original marketing authorization applications and subsequent supplements for Lantus/Optisulin and 
Lyxumia, respectively.  
Insulin glargine 
The toxicology study program of insulin glargine consisted of general toxicity studies (including toxicokinetics 
and anti-drug antibody analysis) up to 3-, 6- and 12-month duration in mice, dogs and rats, respectively, in vitro 
and in vivo genotoxicity studies, carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats, reproductive toxicology studies in rats 
and rabbits, as well as local tolerance studies in rabbits and studies on potential immunogenicity. 
In the repeated dose toxicity studies performed by subcutaneous administration of insulin glargine in mice, rats 
and dogs, the major toxicity findings were related to the pharmacologic action of the drug and included 
hypoglycemia, hypoglycemic shock and coma with the consequence of death, due to the excessive doses tested 
in healthy, non-diabetic animals. These clinical findings were associated with histological findings in the 
pancreas that consisted of a dose-dependent degranulation of the ß cells of the Langerhans islets as well as in 
some severe cases, in the brain that included cortical infarction and malacic changes in the cortex and in the 
region of extrapyramidalic nuclei. 
Insulin glargine is not genotoxic. The carcinogenic potential was studied in mice and rats. In both species, there 
was no evidence for treatment related neoplastic findings other than malignant fibrous histiocytomas at the 
injection site. The increased incidence of this tumour was not attributable to insulin glargine or any excipient, 
but rather to an effect of the acid pH of the vehicle on local subcutaneous tissues in rodents. This species-specific 
finding did not represent a cancer hazard for humans.  
In reproductive toxicity studies in rats, there were no effects on fertility or embryo-fetal development up to the 
highest doses tested (10 or 20 U/kg/day, respectively); a reduction of the rearing rate in F1 animals (attributed 
to hypoglycemia) occurred at 10 U/kg/day. In rabbits, dose dependent hypoglycemia resulted in maternal 
toxicity (hypoglycemic shock, total litter loss) and embryo-foetal toxicity, including single anomalies, at doses ≥ 
1 U/kg/day. Similar effects were obtained with the reference human NPH insulin. 
In studies conducted in guinea pigs, rabbits and pigs to evaluate immunogenicity, insulin glargine had a similar 
or even lower immunogenic potential than human, porcine and bovine insulin. 
Local tolerance in a number of rabbit studies was good for single intravenous, paravenous and subcutaneous 
injections of doses similar to those intended to be used in humans and moderate to good for single intramuscular 
injection. The formulations used in the repeated dose toxicity studies in mice and rats elicited tissue damage 
caused by the low pH of these formulations. 
Lixisenatide 
In rat and mouse exploratory studies single iv or sc doses of lixisenatide (up to 500 µg/kg in mice, up to  5000 
µg/kg in rats) resulted only in transient clinical findings such as lethargy, piloerection and decreased activity. 
Repeat dose toxicity studies were performed in mice, rats and dogs with durations up to 6 months in rats and 12 
months in dogs. There were no important toxicological findings reported in mice or rats. However, in the chronic 
rat study testicular and epididymal effects appeared to occur in the high dose group with cases of atrophy,

spermatid stasis and mineralisation in the testis and oligospermia and aspermia in the epididymis. In dogs, 
reversible testicular and epididymal toxicities were observed. The effects observed in testes and epididymis 
could be due to GLP-1R mediated effects on fluid resorption in the epididymis. Receptor expression analysis in 
testes and epididymis of rats, dogs and humans revealed that GLP-1R is expressed at least 3.3-fold higher in 
dogs compared to humans and at least 100-fold compared to rats. These results indicate that dogs may be more 
susceptible for testicular and epididymal GLP1-R activation and corresponding effects by lixisenatide than rats 
and, to a lesser extent, also more susceptible than humans.  
Reversible adverse microscopic findings in testis and epididymis were also noted in a 8 month study in juvenile 
dogs that were similar to those seen in the repeat dose toxicity study in adult dogs. 
Lixisenatide was negative in a standard battery of genotoxicity tests (Ames test, human lymphocyte 
chromosome aberration test, mouse bone marrow micronucleus test). 
Two-year carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats were performed with dose levels up to 1000 μg/kg BID. In 
agreement with other GLP-1 receptor agonists, lixisenatide showed proliferative effects on thyroid C-cells in 
both species. The applicant has performed a number of mechanistic studies showing higher expression of GLP-1 
receptor in thyroid tissue from rats compared to human tissue, functional activity in a rat C cell line but not in a 
human C cell line and GLP-1 receptor mediated calcitonin release in mice. 
A statistically significant trend for increase in adenocarcinoma in the endometrium was found in 
lixisenatide-treated CD-1 mice as compared to control mice. 
There were no adverse effects on fertility or early embryonic development in the rat at any dose tested. 
Embryofoetal toxicity was studied in rats and rabbits (two studies). Malformations were observed both in the rat 
study and the first rabbit study, with no NOAEL. Also, in a rat study on pre- and postnatal toxicity, there were 
pups with skeletal malformations. Lyxumia should not be used during pregnancy and it is not recommended in 
women of child-bearing potential not using contraception. 
There was a dose- and time-dependent development of antidrug antibodies following SC administration of 
lixisenatide to mice, rats and dogs in studies up to 12 months in duration. There were no signs of 
immune-mediated pathology. While the antibodies did not appear to block the pharmacodynamic effect, the 
pharmacokinetics was affected with higher exposures. 
Specific local tolerance testing in rabbits with the clinical formulation revealed good SC tolerability. 
Insulin glargine/lixisenatide combination 
Both insulin glargine and lixisenatide have thus been extensively studied in toxicology studies and since no 
additional toxicological effects were expected for the combination product, the applicant considers the 
toxicology profile of the combination to be adequately tested with both full programs conducted by using the 
individual compounds. This is agreed with CHMP. 
To support the development of the combination product formulation two local tolerability studies in rabbits were 
conducted with the insulin glargine/lixisenatide combination. Single administration of lixisenatide/insulin 
glargine to rabbits resulted in a good (SC, IV and IM) to moderate (PV) local tolerability.  
Results from toxicological studies included in the original submissions together with the recently performed 
comparative toxicity study with insulin glargine support the qualification of impurities at the suggested limits.

2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
A claim of exclusion from preparation of an environmental risk assessment is made by the applicant because 
insulin glargine and lixisenatide are amino acid sequence analogues of naturally occurring peptides. A reference 
is made to the ERA Guideline where it is stated that “Vitamins, electrolytes, amino acids, peptides, proteins, 
carbohydrates and lipids are exempted because they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the 
environment.”  
It is thus concluded, based on the protein and peptide structure of the compounds that insulin glargine and 
lixisenatide are not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
A series of in vitro studies was performed to evaluate possible interactions of a combination treatment with 
insulin glargine and lixisenatide at the cellular level. Effects of the insulin glargine/lixisenatide combination were 
compared with the effects of both individual components at the level of their specific receptor, on receptor 
downstream signalling, cell apoptosis and proliferation in vitro. No interaction between lixisenatide and insulin 
glargine was indicated at the level of their specific receptor or receptor downstream signalling and no interaction 
regarding effects on apoptosis or cell proliferation was either indicated. 
In vivo studies were also performed in order to evaluate if the combination of insulin glargine and lixisenatide 
shows beneficial metabolic effects over treatment with either drug alone. The effect of the combination was at 
least similar to the effects of lixisenatide and insulin glargine monotherapy and there was a decrease of blood 
glucose levels during both the absorptive and postabsorptive phases of the OGTTs performed similar to that of 
lixisenatide alone during the absorptive phase and to insulin glargine during the postabsorptive phase. No 
increase of insulin glargine’s effect on blood glucose during the postabsorptive phase in dogs was seen and the 
combination thus did not seem to increase the risk for hypo-glycaemia. 
No additional risk for cardiovascular effects was identified when both compounds were co-administered to 
anesthetised dogs, compared to treatment of insulin glargine or lixisenatide individually. 
When pharmacokinetics was analysed in dogs no effect on AUC0-8 of insulin glargine was seen in the presence 
of lixisenatide in the injection solution and Cmax and AUC0-8h of lixisenatide were neither significantly impacted 
by insulin glargine. A significant shortening of the plasma half-lives of lixisenatide was seen after 
coadministration with insulin glargine indicating a shortened absorption period of lixisenatide in the presence of 
insulin glargine. 
To support the development of the combination product formulation two local tolerability studies in rabbits were 
conducted with the insulin glargine/lixisenatide combination. Single administration of lixisenatide/insulin 
glargine to rabbits resulted in a good (SC, IV and IM) to moderate (PV) local tolerability. Both insulin glargine 
and lixisenatide have been extensively studied in toxicology studies and no additional toxicological effects are 
expected for the combination product, the toxicology profile of the combination is considered to have been 
adequately tested with both full programs conducted by using the individual compounds. 
Results from toxicological studies included in the original submissions together with the recently performed 
comparative toxicity study with insulin glargine support the qualification of impurities at the suggested limits. 
The active substances are analogues of naturally occurring peptides and are not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment.

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction  
•  Tabular overview of clinical studies  
Table 1: overview of phase 1 studies 
A phase 2 proof-of concept study (ACT12374) was performed. This was a 24-week, open-label, 2-arm, 
parallel-group, multicenter study comparing the efficacy and safety of the FRC versus insulin glargine in 
combination with metformin in which 323 patients were randomized.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Suliqua is applied as two prefilled pens with different fixed ratios between insulin glargine and lixisenatide, the 
10-40 U pen with a ratio of 2U insulin glargine/1 µg lixisenatide and the 30-60 Unit pen with a ratio of 3U insulin 
glargine/1 µg lixisenatide. In both pens the concentration of insulin glargine is 100 U/ml and the concentration 
of lixisenatide is 50 µg/ml and 33 µg/ml respectively.

The clinical pharmacology file of the fixed ratio combination is referring to data from the mono-components. Six 
phase 1 studies are submitted in support of the clinical pharmacology properties of the combination. Two 
different formulation approaches were investigated during the development: combinations of a fixed ratio of 
insulin glargine and lixisenatide (supported by studies BDR10880 and BDR12547) and combinations of 
individually titrated doses of insulin glargine with a fixed-dose of lixisenatide (supported by studies BDR11578 
and BDR11540). In each of these studies the concentration of insulin glargine used was 100 U/ml, which is the 
same as in Lantus and in the combination product intended for marketing. Based on technical feasibility, the 
fixed-ratio approach was selected for further clinical development while combinations of a fixed dose of 
lixisenatide with individually titrated doses of insulin glargine were not further pursued. In 2 exploratory studies 
(BDR11038 and PKD12406), insulin glargine concentrations other than 100 U/mL intended for marketing were 
administered (approximately 60, 90, and 300 U/mL) in combination with lixisenatide. These concentrations 
were not further pursued. 
The formulation of the fixed ratio combination used in the phase 3 studies is identical to the proposed 
commercial formulation. The composition of the two dosage strengths intended for marketing are also 
comparable to the composition of the marketed mono-components insulin glargine (Lantus) and lixisenatide 
(Lyxumia). 
Total lixisenatide was determined with a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a 
double-antibody technique. Free insulin glargine was measured with a validated radioimmunoassay (RIA) 
method using a human insulin RIA kit.  
Anti-lixisenatide antibodies were assessed by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) method and anti-insulin 
antibodies were assessed using radioimmunoprecipitation (RIP) methods.  
Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by non-compartmental methods. 
Absorption 
Data from the individual files describe a rapid absorption of lixisenatide that is not influenced by the 
administered dose following subcutaneous administration to patients with type 2 diabetes (median t max of 1 to 
3.5 hours). The extent of absorption was independent of injection site, while the rate of absorption was 
somewhat slower after administration in the thigh than in the arm or abdomen. These differences in rate of 
absorption were however not considered clinically relevant. 
For insulin glargine, insulin serum concentrations indicated a slower and much more prolonged absorption and 
showed a lack of a peak after subcutaneous injection of insulin glargine in comparison to human NPH insulin 
(intermediate-acting human insulin). 
Bioavailability 
Study BDR10880 was a randomised, cross-over, single-dose, open,  euglucaemic clamp study on the relative 
bioavailability and activity of two different fixed ratio formulations of insulin glargine and lixisenatide compared 
to separate simultaneous injections performed in 42 subjects with T1DM. Blood samples were collected pre-dose 
and up to 24 hours post-dose. The test formulations were premixed formulations of lixisenatide 66 µg/ml and 
insulin glargine 100 U/ml (1.5 U/1µg) given at a dose of 0.264 µg/kg and 0.4 U/kg (test 1) and lixisenatide 25 
µg/ml and insulin glargine 100 U/ml (4 U/1µg) given at a dose of 0.100 µg/kg and 0.4 U/kg (test 2). Reference 
formulations were separate simultaneous injections of lixisenatide 100 µg/ml and insulin glargine 100 U/ml 
given at corresponding doses.

Study BDR12547 was a randomised, 4-treatment, 4-period, 4-sequence cross-over study comparing the 
relative bioavailability of lixisenatide from three different premixed formulations of lixisenatide/insulin glargine 
in healthy subjects. The tested formulations contained 100 IU/ml insulin glargine and 50 µg/ml (F1; ratio 2 IU/1 
µg), 100 µg/ml (F2; ratio 1 IU/1 µg) or 200 µg/ml (F3; ratio 0.5 U/1 µg) lixisenatide respectively. Each 
formulation was given at a lixisenatide dose of 20 µg as follows:

Treatment A: 20 µg lixisenatide and 10 U insulin glargine (1 injection of 100 µl of F3) 
Treatment B: 20 µg lixisenatide and 20 U insulin glargine (1 injection of 200 µl of F2) 
Treatment C: 20 µg lixisenatide and 40 U insulin glargine (1 injection of 400 µl of F1) 
Treatment D: 20 µg lixisenatide and 40 IU insulin glargine (4 separate sequential injections of 100 µl of F1). 
Blood samples were collected pre-dose and up to 36 hours post-dose. 
For AUCinf and AUCt the 90% confidence interval for the treatment ratios fell within the conventional acceptance 
range of 80.00-125.00% and for Cmax all point estimates and CIs were within the bioequivalence interval except 
for the lower limits for treatment ratios A/C and A/D which were just below the bioequivalence limit. 
Study BDR11578 was a randomised, single-dose, two-treatment, two-sequence, cross-over, euglycaemic 
clamp study on the relative bioavailability and activity of 0.6 U/kg insulin glargine (100 U/ml) and 20 µg 
lixisenatide, given as an on-site mix administered as a single injection at 1 periumbilical site compared to 
separate simultaneous injections at opposite periumbilical sites in 23 patients with T1DM. Blood samples were 
collected pre-dose and up to 24 hours post-dose.

Study PKD12406 was a randomized, 4-treatment, crossover study on the relative bioavailability of lixisenatide 
in insulin glargine solution in 20 healthy subjects. Three different test formulations were tested with different 
concentrations of lixisenatide (75, 150 and 300 µg/ml) and with the same concentration of insulin glargine (300 
U/ml). The reference was lixisenatide monotherapy in the same dose (15 µg). For the comparisons of the 3 
combination treatments (Treatments B, C, and D) to Treatment A (lixisenatide without insulin glargine), 
lixisenatide exposure was generally comparable between the treatments, with point estimates of exposure 
(based on AUC0-∞, AUC0-t, and AUC0-12) between 0.83 and 0.96, but not all CIs were entirely within the standard 
equivalence boundary of 0.8 to 1.25. The maximum concentration of lixisenatide when coadministered with 
insulin glargine was reduced compared to the injection of lixisenatide alone, with point estimates of the ratios 
ranging from 0.64 to 0.76.  
Bioequivalence 
Since the final formulation was used in the phase 3 studies, no bioequivalence study between clinical formulation 
and commercial formulation was necessary.

Influence on absorption of site of injection or fat layer thickness 
According to data from the mono-components there were no clinically relevant differences in serum insulin 
levels after abdominal, deltoid or thigh administration of insulin glargine. For lixisenatide monotherapy, extent 
of absorption is independent of injection site, while rate of absorption is somewhat slower after administration 
in the thigh than in the arm or abdomen resulting in a slightly delayed tmax (change in median from 2 to 2.5 
hours), and somewhat lower Cmax (mean ratio 0.86). These differences in rate of absorption were however not 
considered clinically relevant. Both mono-components can be given in the thigh, abdomen or upper arm/deltoid. 
The applicant argues that following administration of the insulin glargine/lixisenatide fixed ratio combination, 
effects on the PK of the individual components are mainly caused by interactions occurring in the SC tissue at the 
injection site. These interactions are expected to be independent of the injection site itself. Therefore, no specific 
study was conducted to investigate the effect of different injection sites on the PK of insulin glargine and 
lixisenatide following administration of the combination product. In the Phase 3 studies, patients could select 
between thigh, abdomen or upper arm for injection of the insulin glargine/lixisenatide fixed ratio combination. 
Influence on absorption of fat layer thickness has not been addressed by the applicant. 
Distribution 
According to data from the mono-component, the binding of lixisenatide to human plasma protein was 
approximately 55%. Lixisenatide has not been administered intravenously. Hence, volume of distribution is not 
determined. Apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) was reported to be around 100 l.  
For the combination, the following data regarding lixisenatide is available. In study BDR10880 in T1DM patients 
Vz/F of lixisenatide was 126 and 91.1 L at insulin glargine/lixisenatide ratios of 1.5U/1 μg and 4U/1 μg 
respectively. Also in healthy volunteers (study BDR12547) Vz/F for lixisenatide was around 100 l at insulin 
glargine/lixisenatide ratios of 0.5, 1 and 2 U/1µg. 
For insulin glargine, Vss/F was 1760 and 1660 L at insulin glargine/lixisenatide ratios of 1.5U/1μg and 4U/1μg 
according to results from study BDR10880. 
Elimination 
After subcutaneous injection of Lantus in diabetic patients, insulin glargine is rapidly metabolized at the carboxyl 
terminus of the Beta chain with formation of two active metabolites M1 (21A-Gly-insulin) and M2 
(21A-Gly-des-30B-Thr-insulin). In plasma, the principal circulating compound is the metabolite M1. The 
exposure to M1 increases with the administered dose of Lantus. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
findings indicate that the effect of the subcutaneous injection with Lantus is principally based on exposure to M1. 
Further degradation is assumed to be similar to endogenous insulin. Since no influence of lixisenatide on the 
metabolism of insulin glargine was expected, no metabolism studies were performed with the combination. 
As a peptide, lixisenatide is eliminated through glomerular filtration, followed by tubular reabsorption and 
subsequent metabolic degradation, resulting in smaller peptides and amino acids, which are reintroduced in the 
protein metabolism. The underlying metabolic processes are considered to be generally understood and no 
metabolite profiling has been performed. Therefore, no metabolism studies were performed with the 
combination. After multiple dose administration in patients with type 2 diabetes, mean terminal half-life was 
approximately 3 hours and the mean apparent clearance (CL/F) about 35 L/h.

Dose proportionality and time dependency 
In study BDR10880 with T1DM patients, in which approximately 8 and 21 μg lixisenatide were administered with 
insulin glargine at doses of approximately 30 U in the combination, the statistical analysis of dose proportionality 
for this 2.6-fold increase in lixisenatide dose indicated that the AUC increased in a dose proportional manner. 
Cmax increased less-than proportional with dose.  
In Studies BDR10880 and BDR11578, the AUC of insulin glargine administered as insulin glargine/lixisenatide 
combination or separate simultaneous injections increased with increasing dose of insulin glargine. In study 
BDR10880 an AUC0-24h of 221 µU*h/ml was achieved with a 0.4 U/kg dose of insulin glargine, while in study 
BDR11578 an AUC0-24h of 302 µU*h/ml was achieved with a 0.6 U/kg dose of insulin glargine (in both cases with 
the insulin glargine/lixisenatide combination). 
According to previous results from the mono-component lixisenatide seems to display time independent 
pharmacokinetics and has no accumulation in subjects with no anti-lixisenatide antibodies. Following 
administration of the combination, the lixisenatide PK profile reaches Cmax after approximately 2.0 to 3.0 hours 
and returns back to values below the limit of quantification well before 24 hours in anti-lixisenatide antibody 
negative subjects. Thus, no relevant accumulation of lixisenatide is to be expected following repeated 
administration of the combination and was therefore not investigated.  
Following repeated administration of insulin glargine alone, no accumulation was observed. Lixisenatide has 
shown to have no relevant impact on the PK of insulin glargine when administered as combination. Therefore, 
accumulation of insulin glargine when administered as combination was not investigated. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
The inter-individual variability for AUC and C max of lixisenatide and insulin glargine when given as a fixed ratio 
combination was generally moderate. In study BDR10880 CV was 25-50 % for lixisenatide and 30-50% for 
insulin glargine and in study BDR12547 CV was 30-40% for lixisenatide. 
For lixisenatide monotherapy the inter-individual variability for the PK parameters was generally moderate (CV 
was for the most part approximately 30% to 60%). In the bioequivalence study which had a replicate design, the 
within-subject variation was estimated to be 27% for AUC0-∞ and 22% for Cmax.  In the population analysis the 
estimated inter-occasion variability in absorption was around 35%. 
For insulin glargine monotherapy the intra-subject CV in study 1012 was 14% for AUC0-24 h and 28 % for Cmax 
while the inter-subject CV was 25% for AUC0-24 h and 36% for Cmax. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
The phase 1 studies with the combination were performed in healthy volunteers or in patients with type 1 
diabetes mellitus. Sparse sampling was performed in the phase 2 and in the phase 3 studies in patients with type 
2 diabetes mellitus with assessment of lixisenatide.  
Between-study comparison from lixisenatide monotherapy suggests similar lixisenatide exposure in T2DM 
patients and healthy volunteers. Using mixed effects modelling, a population PK model was developed for 
lixisenatide monotherapy. Given the minor differences in the PK profile of lixisenatide when given in combination 
compared to when given in separate simultaneous injections and the high inter-occasion variability, the impact 
of the combination on the existing population PK model for lixisenatide was not evaluated.  
Insulin absorption was similar in type 2 diabetic subjects as compared to healthy volunteers according to data 
from insulin glargine monotherapy. Doses of insulin glargine when administered alone or in combination with 
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016 
Page 31/113 
  
  
lixisenatide are determined individually according to patient’s FPG values. Therefore, no population PK model 
was established for insulin glargine.  
Special populations 
The impact of insulin glargine on the PK of lixisenatide is regarded to be confined solely due to an effect on the 
absorption from the subcutaneous depot. Therefore, the impact of intrinsic (primarily body weight, renal 
function and anti-drug antibodies) and extrinsic factors on the PK of lixisenatide is not altered once the peptide 
has reached the blood circulation. Based on this rationale no specific PK studies were conducted to evaluate 
potential intrinsic sources of PK variability of insulin glargine or lixisenatide following administration of the 
insulin glargine/lixisenatide combination. However, in Study ACT12374 in patients with T2DM, information on 
the influence of anti-lixisenatide antibodies on the plasma concentrations of lixisenatide in patients treated with 
the insulin glargine/lixisenatide combination is generated. Data in special populations with the monotherapies is 
summarised below. 
Impaired renal function 
In subjects with mild (creatinine clearance calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula 60-90 ml/min), moderate 
(creatinine clearance 30-60 ml/min) and severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-30 ml/min) AUC of 
lixisenatide was increased by 46%, 51% and 87%, respectively. 
The pharmacokinetics of insulin glargine were not evaluated in special populations (e.g. patients with impaired 
renal or liver function), nor was the influence of gender, age or race. It is expected that modifications to 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics occurring with insulin glargine in subjects with impaired renal and 
hepatic function will be similar to modifications observed with human insulin. A warning for diminished insulin 
requirements in renal and hepatic impairment, and a steady decrease in insulin requirements in the elderly has 
been included in the SmPC. In the light of these warnings and since the dose must be individually adjusted to 
each patient, the lack of pharmacokinetic data in sub-populations was considered acceptable for insulin glargine. 
Impaired hepatic function 
As lixisenatide is cleared primarily by the kidney, no pharmacokinetic study has been performed in patients with 
acute or chronic hepatic impairment. Hepatic dysfunction is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of 
lixisenatide. 
Gender 
Gender has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of lixisenatide. 
The influence of gender on the pharmacokinetics of insulin glargine was not evaluated. In clinical studies, 
subgroup analyses based on gender did not indicate any difference in safety and efficacy in insulin 
glargine-treated patients compared to the entire study population. 
Race 
Ethnic origin had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of lixisenatide based on the results of 
pharmacokinetic studies in Caucasian, Japanese and Chinese subjects. 
Weight 
Body weight has no clinically relevant effect on lixisenatide AUC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016 
Page 32/113 
  
  
Elderly 
Age has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of lixisenatide. In a pharmacokinetic study in 
elderly non-diabetic subjects, administration of lixisenatide 20 mcg resulted in a mean increase of lixisenatide 
AUC by 29% in the elderly population (11 subjects aged 65 to 74 years and 7 subjects aged ≥75 years) 
compared to 18 subjects aged 18 to 45 years, likely related to reduced renal function in the older age group. 
The influence of age on the pharmacokinetics of insulin glargine was not evaluated. In clinical studies, subgroup 
analyses based on age did not indicate any difference in safety and efficacy in insulin glargine-treated patients 
compared to the entire study population. 
Children 
No studies have been performed with the combination product in patients below 18 years of age. A product 
specific waiver (EMEA-000915-PIP01-10) from investigating the effects of this FRC for the treatment of T2DM in 
the paediatric population has been accepted. 
Subjects with anti-insulin glargine antibodies 
Anti-insulin antibodies were determined in all Phase 2 and 3 multiple-dose studies with the combination. The 
effect of anti-insulin antibodies on insulin exposure was not investigated in the combination studies.  
Subjects with anti-lixisenatide antibodies 
From studies with lixisenatide monotherapy it is known that lixisenatide PK is greatly influenced by presence of 
lixisenatide antibodies. For example in Study DRI6012, in which patients were treated in parallel groups at doses 
of 5 to 30 μg QD or BID for 13 weeks, the mean AUC [04.5h] and Cmax values for total lixisenatide in 
antibody-positive patients were up to 13.7-fold higher than in antibody-negative patients. The pharmacokinetics 
was therefore mainly evaluated in subjects and patients without anti-lixisenatide antibodies. 
Anti-lixisenatide antibodies were determined in all Phase 1 single-dose studies with the combination as well as 
in all Phase 2 and 3 multiple-dose studies. Three subjects in the single-dose studies in healthy subjects (2 in 
BDR12547 and 1 in PKD12406) and 6 patients in the single-dose study BDR10880 in patients with T1DM were 
recorded as having anti-lixisenatide antibodies. Three of the 6 anti-lixisenatide antibody positive patients in 
Study BDR10880 were antibody positive at baseline. In 8 of 9 of the cases, the PK profiles of lixisenatide in 
antibody-positive individuals were within the ranges found for antibody-negative individuals.  
In the multiple-dose Phase 2 Study ACT12374, following treatment of patients with T2DM with the insulin 
glargine/lixisenatide combination for 24 weeks, 72 out of 147 patients (49.0%) had anti-lixisenatide antibodies. 
In line with observations in the lixisenatide monotherapy studies, the presence of anti-lixisenatide antibodies 
resulted in up to approximately 10-fold increases in plasma concentrations of total lixisenatide.  
Interactions 
As peptides, insulin glargine and lixisenatide are subject to standard proteolytic processes involving degradation 
to small peptides and amino acids; both peptides are not expected to be metabolized by CYP isozymes. Insulin 
glargine is expected to be eliminated like human insulin. Lixisenatide is assumed to be eliminated through renal 
filtration followed by tubular reabsorption and subsequent metabolic degradation. Due to the nature of the 
proteolytic processes and the different pathways of degradation, no interaction between circulating insulin 
glargine and lixisenatide is expected. The impact of insulin glargine on the PK of lixisenatide is regarded to be 
confined solely due to an effect on the absorption from the subcutaneous depot. Coadministered drugs that 
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016 
Page 33/113 
  
  
inhibit or induce metabolic pathways are expected to have no effect on the systemic exposure to insulin glargine 
and lixisenatide. 
In vitro 
The potential for lixisenatide to inhibit the CYP isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, 
CYP2D6, and CYP3A, and the transport proteins OCT2 and OATP1B1 and to induce CYP1A, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and 
CYP3A was evaluated in vitro. Based on these data lixisenatide is unlikely to cause drug-drug interactions with 
CYP450 substrates or substrates of OCT2 and OATP1B1. 
No data are available for insulin glargine. 
In vivo 
There are no known pharmacokinetic interactions for insulin glargine. 
In vivo lixisenatide delays gastric emptying and may thereby reduce the extent and rate of absorption of orally 
administered drugs. The influence of lixisenatide monotherapy on paracetamol (as a marker for gastric 
emptying), on oral contraceptives (efficacy dependent on threshold concentrations), on drugs commonly 
prescribed in patients with T2DM (ramipril and atorvastatin) and on drugs with narrow therapeutic window 
(digoxin and warfarin) were evaluated. Lixisenatide in general showed no or very small effects on AUC of the 
concomitantly administered drugs, but there was a delay in t max and a reduction in Cmax, which was dependent 
on when lixisenatide was administered in relation to the concomitantly administered drug. In the SmPC drugs 
that are dependent on threshold concentrations (such as antibiotics) and gastro-resistant formulations are 
recommended to be administered 1 h before or 4 h after lixisenatide ingestion. The SmPC also states that 
patients receiving medicinal products of either a narrow therapeutic ratio or medicinal products that require 
careful clinical monitoring should be followed closely, especially at the time of initiation of lixisenatide treatment 
and that these medicinal products should be taken in a standardised way in relation to lixisenatide. 
For the combination product, a decrease in Cmax by approximately 30% and a delay in t max of lixisenatide by 1 
hour at unchanged exposure have been observed compared to separate simultaneous injections of lixisenatide 
and insulin glargine (study BDR10880). The applicant has performed simulations applying the population PK/PD 
model describing the correlation between lixisenatide concentration and inhibition of gastric emptying, 
demonstrating that recovery of gastric empyting to baseline occurs within 11 hours after administration of the 
maximum intended dose of lixisenatide of 20 μg in the fixed ratio combination as well as with 20 μg of 
lixisenatide given alone.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Insulin glargine 
The primary activity of insulin, including insulin glargine, is regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its 
analogues lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, 
and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein 
synthesis. 
Lixisenatide 
Lixisenatide is a DPP-4 resistant glucagon-like peptide (GLP1) receptor agonist. The GLP-1 receptor is the target 
for native GLP-1, an endogenous incretin hormone that potentiates glucose-dependent insulin secretion from 
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016 
Page 34/113 
  
  
beta cells and suppresses glucagon from alpha cells in the pancreas. Similar to endogenous GLP-1, the action of 
lixisenatide is mediated via a specific interaction with GLP-1 receptors, including those on pancreatic alpha and 
beta cells. 
Lixisenatide stimulates glucose dependent insulin secretion. In parallel, glucagon secretion is suppressed. 
Lixisenatide also slows gastric emptying thereby reducing the rate at which meal-derived glucose appears in 
blood circulation. Lixisenatide has been shown to preserve beta cell function and to prevent cell death 
(apoptosis) in isolated human pancreatic islet cells. 
Insulin glargine/lixisenatide combination 
The postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) lowering effect of lixisenatide, mediated in part by a sustained ability to 
delay gastric emptying, is associated with a reduction of HbA1c, a limited risk for hypoglycaemia and a 
weight-lowering effect. With regard to the combination therapy with basal insulin these effects of lixisenatide are 
complementary to the glucose-lowering effect of basal insulin, which primarily targets fasting plasma glucose 
(FPG) and on its own can increase the risk for hypoglycemia and weight gain. 
Primary pharmacology 
Study BDR10880 investigated the pharmacodynamics of insulin glargine and lixisenatide as a fixed ratio 
combination compared to the pharmacodynamics of each substance administered as separate simultaneous 
injections under euglycaemic clamp conditions in patients with T1DM. Following administration of the insulin 
glargine/lixisenatide combination at 2 different strengths (0.4 U/kg insulin glargine + 0.264 μg/kg lixisenatide, 
and 0.4 U/kg insulin glargine + 0.100 μg/kg lixisenatide), the PD activity, as assessed by the results of 
GIR-AUC0-24h, were comparable to the corresponding separate simultaneous injections of insulin glargine and 
lixisenatide with treatment/reference ratios of 0.95 (90% CI: 0.76 to 1.18) and 0.83 (90% CI: 0.61 to 1.12), 
respectively. 
Thus adding lixisenatide to insulin glargine solution had little to no impact on the PD of insulin glargine; 
GIR-AUC0-24h and GIRmax being comparable for the combination and separate simultaneous injections. The 
impact of the combination of insulin glargine and lixisenatide on the pharmacodynamics of lixisenatide has not 
been studied in Phase 1 studies. 
Consistent with a relatively constant concentration/time profile of insulin glargine over 24 hours with no 
pronounced peak when administered alone, the glucose utilization rate/time profile was similar, no pronounced 
peak, when given in the combination insulin glargine/lixisenatide.  
Study BDR11578 is considered supportive for BDR10880. This was a euglycaemic clamp study conducted in 
patients with T1DM. This study also demonstrated that adding lixisenatide to insulin glargine solution had little 
to no impact on the PD of insulin glargine; GIR-AUC0-24h and GIRmax being comparable for the combination and 
separate simultaneous injections. 
Insulin glargine studies 
Clinical pharmacology studies have demonstrated that insulin glargine administered once-daily is effective in 
maintaining glycaemic control as assessed by reductions in HbA1c in subjects with T1DM or T2DM. The 
glucodynamic effects of insulin glargine are the result of its delayed and predictable absorption from the 
subcutaneous injection site resulting in a smooth time-action profile with no pronounced peak

Lixisenatide studies 
Data from lixisenatide monotherapy studies PDY12545, ACT6011 and DRI6012 provide supplementary 
information on the mode of action as well as the pharmacodynamic effects of lixisenatide at doses below 20 μg. 
The clinical pharmacology findings from studies with lixisenatide have demonstrated PD effects consistent with 
potent GLP-1 receptor agonism, including a pronounced reduction in PPG levels, a sustained delay in gastric 
emptying, as well as glucagonostatic properties in patients with T2DM (ACT6011 and DRI6012). Lixisenatide 
induced reductions in PPG concentrations after breakfast, lunch, and dinner, when compared with placebo, most 
notably with the first meal after administration. This effect was maintained after 28 days of once-daily 
treatment.  Assessed for the first meal after lixisenatide administration, the PPG effects were accompanied by 
gastric emptying and reduced insulin secretion. Because delay of gastric emptying prolongs absorption of 
meal-derived glucose and has the capacity to blunt PPG excursions, the pronounced decrease in PPG with 
lixisenatide can be related to the significant and sustained delay in gastric emptying. Additional PD effects are 
stimulation of insulin release in response to an intravenous glucose challenge, with restoration of first- and 
second-phase insulin secretion. Fasting blood glucose concentrations in patients with T2DM were also reduced 
during multiple-dose treatment with lixisenatide as compared with placebo. As expected for a GLP-1 receptor 
agonist, counter-regulatory glucagon responses to hypoglycaemia are not impaired by lixisenatide in subjects 
with insulin-treated T2DM. 
Additional studies have shown that 5, 10, and 20 μg lixisenatide once-daily provided a significant reduction in 
PPG levels in patients with T2DM (ACT6011). A significant delay of gastric emptying (measured by 
acetaminophen absorption) with concomitant reductions in PPG were seen in healthy subjects with doses of 5, 
10, and 20 μg compared to placebo (PDY12545). 
In accordance with the label, lixisenatide is initiated with QD injections of 10 μg for 2 weeks. The lixisenatide 
dose is then increased to a maintenance dose of 20 μg QD. The lower end of the lixisenatide dosing range is 
defined by the minimum dose for glycaemic efficacy in the placebo-controlled dose-ranging study DRI6012, 
where doses beginning at 5 μg once-daily provided HbA1c and PPG control. Data from this study indicated that 
the PPG-lowering effect translates to a significant reduction in HbA1c following 13 weeks of treatment, including 
the dose levels of 5 and 10 μg lixisenatide (Figure 1).

Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Dosing of the insulin glargine/lixisenatide combination is intended to be based on the patient’s individual FPG 
values. The respective dose of lixisenatide will therefore be determined by the insulin glargine dose and the 
insulin glargine/lixisenatide ratio. No individual adjustment for glycaemia control of the lixisenatide dose will be 
performed. Therefore, no PK/PD relationship of the combination was required for assessing dose 
recommendations. 
The PK/PD relationship of insulin glargine 100 U/mL monotherapy was analysed as a secondary endpoint in the 
multiple dosing study TDR11626. Scatter plots of individual GIR-AUC0-24h over INS-AUC0-24 by treatment 
showed a positive correlation between the GIR-AUC and INS-AUC over the dosing interval. In steady state, a 
trend for higher GIR-AUC at higher exposure (INS-AUC0-24) was observed. 
For lixisenatide monotherapy, using mixed-effects modelling and an earlier population PK model for lixisenatide, 
the effect of lixisenatide on plasma glucose concentrations in patients with T2DM was investigated for FPG and 
PPG, using data pooled from Phase 2 studies PDY6797 and DRI6012. 
The FPG model applied to responders described the effect of lixisenatide as a reduction in glucose production in 
a turnover model. The glucose production rate was reduced, following the lixisenatide concentration according 
to an Emax model. The maximum reduction in glucose production rate was estimated to be approximately 44%. 
The characteristic time constant of the influence of lixisenatide in this process was approximately 29 hours. The 
EC50 was 18.5 pg/mL, with a high variability. Baseline FPG (i.e., before start of treatment) and Asian race were 
covariates for EC50. 
The maximum effect of lixisenatide on plasma glucose AUC0.5-4.5h after a standard breakfast (PPG) was a 
reduction of 320.4 mg.h/dL (17.8 mmol.h/L) for the population mean, compared with no lixisenatide treatment. 
The lixisenatide AUC50 (where half of the effect was observed) was approximately 104 pg.h/mL (95% CI: 57 to 
151 pg.h/mL). 
To evaluate the effect of a decrease in Cmax by 16% of lixisenatide at unchanged exposure when administered 
as insulin glargine/lixisenatide combination compared to lixisenatide alone (Study BDR11578), simulations were 
performed applying the population PK/PD model describing the correlation between lixisenatide concentration 
and effect on FPG. 
The decrease in Cmax by 16% was simulated by decreasing the absorption rate constant ka by 23%. Due to the 
flip-flop kinetics of lixisenatide, this decrease in ka resulted in a simulated prolonged exposure to lixisenatide. 
The simulation suggested an improved effect of lixisenatide on FPG indicating that the time of exposure to 
lixisenatide rather than maximum concentration determines the efficacy. This conclusion is further supported by 
that fact that Cmax of lixisenatide following administration of the insulin glargine/lixisenatide combination is well 
above the EC50 value of 10.3 pg/mL in the population PK/PD base model. 
Modelling of interaction between insulin and GLP-1 analogues 
A longitudinal model-based meta-analyses (MBMA) was performed to quantify the HbA1c response to treatment 
with different basal insulins in combination with different GLP-1 analogues. There was a statistically significant 
interaction between GLP-1 analogues and basal insulins such that the effect of the combination was synergistic 
but less than the sum of the two independent effects. The interaction coefficient was found to be similar and not 
statistically significantly different for the interaction between insulin glargine and lixisenatide vs insulin degludec 
and liraglutide

Based on the model, the dose-response for lixisenatide monotherapy, insulin glargine monotherapy, and the 
fixed ratio combination at a ratio of 2U/1μg at 24 weeks in a typical population on an oral antidiabetic drug 
(OAD) background therapy with a mean baseline HbA1c of 8% was estimated (Figure 2). The black lines are the 
mean estimated effects and the coloured regions span the 90% CI. The figure shows that the response of the 
combination is greater than each of the individual components over the complete dose range, consistent with 
the synergistic interaction. A comparison of the dose-response for lixisenatide monotherapy and contribution of 
lixisenatide to the response of fixed ratio combination at a ratio of 2:1 (Pen A in the dose ranges of 10 to 40 U 
insulin glargine and 5 to 20 μg lixisenatide) showed that there is a significant contribution of the individual 
components to the fixed ratio combination over the complete dose range. At low doses the contribution of 
lixisenatide to the fixed ratio combination is almost as large as the independent effect of lixisenatide.

The x-axis shows the dose of insulin glargine. The lixisenatide dose can be obtained by dividing the insulin glargine dose by 2. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The applicant wants to bridge to the clinical pharmacology data for the mono-components, based on showing 
similar exposure to the mono-components given as separate injections. For a fixed-dose combination containing 
known active substances the Guideline on clinical development of fixed combination medicinal products states 
that bioequivalence should be demonstrated between the free combination of the individual mono-components 
and the marketing formulation (fixed combination). However, since the indication is not a substitution indication 
and since the final formulation of the fixed combination was used in the phase 3 studies, it is not considered 
critical to demonstrate formal bioequivalence between the fixed combinations and the free combination. The 
applicant states that the objective of the phase 1 program was not to demonstrate bioequivalence to the 
mono-components but to characterize the PK and PD of lixisenatide when administered as combination 
compared to separate simultaneous injections. This is agreed.

The method for detection of lixisenatide was considered sufficiently validated during the assessment of Lyxumia. 
The performed re-validations due to extension of calibration range and change of laboratory are adequate. The 
performance of the analytical methods for insulin glargine was acceptable. The method is not selective for insulin 
glargine but also measures human insulin as well as metabolites M1 and M2. The performance of the analytical 
methods for anti-lixisenatide and anti-insulin antibodies seems acceptable. 
Absorption 
Study BDR10880 is considered to be the most important study, since it investigated the pharmacokinetics of 
insulin glargine and lixisenatide as a fixed ratio combination compared to the pharmacokinetics of each 
substance administered as separate simultaneous injections at two different fixed ratios (1.5 U/1 µg and 4 U/1 
µg), covering the range of ratios intended for marketing. The formulations tested in study BDR10880 were not 
of the same fixed ratio concentrations as those intended for marketing, but the ratios intended for marketing (2 
U/1 µg and 3 U/1 µg) are within the range of ratios tested in the study. For insulin glargine, the same 
concentration (100 U/ml) is used in study BDR10880 as well as in the formulations intended for marketing. This 
comparison is considered sufficient since the indication is not a substitution indication and since the final 
formulation of the fixed combination was used in the phase 3 studies. The study was performed in patients with 
type 1 diabetes mellitus (lacking an endogenous source of insulin) since the bioanalytical method used for 
assessment of insulin glargine showed complete cross-reactivity to human insulin. For lixisenatide, the total 
exposure (AUCinf) almost met the equivalence criteria for strength 1 (ratio 0.92, 90% CI 0.78-1.08) and did 
meet the equivalence criteria for strength 2 (ratio 0.97, 90% CI 0.83-1.13) when comparing the premixed 
combination to separate simultaneous injections. For AUC0-t the results were not within formal acceptance 
criteria (strength 1 ratio 0.82, 90% CI 0.68-0.99 and strength 2 ratio 0.93, 90% CI 0.77-1.11). The results 
however indicate similar total exposure of lixisenatide with the fixed combination compared to the free 
combination although not all comparisons are within formal equivalence criteria. Regarding Cmax, the fixed ratio 
combination resulted in lower values compared to the separate simultaneous injections (34 % lower Cmax with 
strength 1 and 22% lower Cmax with strength 2). Tmax was achieved 1 hour later for strength 1 and 0.75 hour 
later for strength 2 compared to the reference. The applicant has included a discussion regarding the effect of a 
decrease in lixisenatide Cmax at unchanged exposure using simulations with a previously developed population 
PK/PD-model, concluding that this decrease is not clinically relevant. It is agreed that a decrease in lixisenatide 
Cmax of 22-34% is not likely to be clinically relevant considering the available data on efficacy and safety for 
lixisenatide, the fact that the product is individually titrated based on blood glucose levels and considering that 
the final combination formulation has been used in the phase 3 studies.  
For insulin glargine the point estimates for AUC0-24 h were 0.86 (90% CI 0.77-0.96) and 0.88 (90% CI 
0.79-0.98) for the treatment ratios T1/R1 and T2/R2 respectively. Thus, formal equivalence was not 
demonstrated since the lower limit of the confidence interval was slightly below 0.80. A 12-14% decrease in 
AUC0-24h for insulin glargine was seen when given as a fixed ratio combination with lixisenatide compared to as 
separate simultaneous injections. However, the relative bioavailability of insulin glargine can be considered to 
be comparable in the fixed ratio combination compared to separate simultaneous injections. Since insulin 
glargine does not have a distinguished peak following subcutaneous injection it is considered acceptable to only 
calculate ratios and confidence intervals for AUC and not for cmax for insulin glargine. 
It is not intended for patients to be able to switch between separate administrations of the individual 
components and the combination, and thus it is not necessary to show strict bioequivalence. 
Study BDR12457 investigated the relative bioavailability of lixisenatide when administered in combination with 
insulin glargine at three different fixed ratios (0.5 U/1 µg, 1U/ 1µg and 2U/1 µg), i e without comparison to the 
individual mono-components. One of the ratios tested was 2 IU/1 µg, which is one of the ratios intended for

marketing. All treatments tested resulted in similar exposure to lixisenatide. Thus, the bioavailability of 
lixisenatide was not affected by the insulin glargine/lixisenatide ratio.  
Study BDR11578 investigated high body-weight adjusted doses of insulin together with a fixed dose of 
lixisenatide, i.e. not as a fixed ratio combination, but with a range of ratios relevant the formulations intended 
for marketing. The exposure of insulin glargine as well as of lixisenatide was within conventional bioequivalence 
criteria when comparing administration of the on-site mix to separate simultaneous injections, while the Cmax of 
lixisenatide was 16 % lower and the t max occurred slightly later. The results are largely in line with the results 
from study BDR10880 with the fixed-ratio combination. 
Study BDR11540 investigated low doses of insulin together with a fixed dose of lixisenatide, but the 
formulations were given as fixed-ratio combinations of 0.25U/1µg and 0.5 U/1 µg (i.e. outside the range of 
ratios intended for marketing). In contrast to the previous pharmacokinetic studies, this study had treatment 
with only lixisenatide as reference (not separate injections of both insulin glargine and lixisenatide). The two test 
treatments were bioequivalent to each other, in line with the results from study BDR12547. However, 
administration of lixisenatide together with insulin glargine resulted in significantly lower exposure compared to 
administration of lixisenatide alone. The test formulations had 35-40% lower AUC and 46-48% lower Cmax 
compared to the reference treatment. See further discussion in section on interactions. 
Study BDR11038 and PKD12406 investigated other insulin glargine concentrations than the concentration 
intended for marketing, and has therefore not been assessed. However, since study PKD12406 was the only 
study except study BDR11540 where the fixed ratio combination was compared to lixisenatide monotherapy, 
this study has been briefly summarised. In contrast to the results from study BDR11540, study PKD12406 
indicated similar total exposure with the fixed combination compared to lixisenatide monotherapy. This is in line 
with what has been seen when comparing the fixed combination to separate simultaneous injections of the 
mono-components. 
Given the similarity in PK of the two components when given separately or together, a major difference on the 
influence of injection site between the fixed combination and the mono-components is not expected. Also, for a 
long-acting product differences in rate of absorption are generally not very critical. Since the mono-components 
can be administered in thigh, abdomen or upper arm without clinically relevant differences in PK and since the 
patients could select between these injections sites in the phase 3 studies for the combination, it is considered 
acceptable that the effect of site on injection has not been specifically investigated for Suliqua. As for many 
subcutaneous formulations, there could be a risk for higher intra-individual variability in exposure in patients 
with high BMI alternating between injection sites with more or less subcutaneous fat. In this case, the clinical 
impact of the variation is however expected to be low, considering the long-acting nature of both components 
together with the relatively high between-day variability in food intake and physical exercise of most patients. 
Distribution 
Vz/F of lixisenatide reported from studies with the fixed ratio combination was similar to results previously 
obtained with the mono-component. For insulin glargine, no information regarding distribution volume or 
protein binding is given in the SmPC or EPAR. No new studies regarding the distribution of the fixed combination 
are necessary. 
Elimination 
It is agreed that no new studies on the metabolism or excretion of lixisenatide or insulin glargine are warranted. 
Pharmacokinetic data for the mono-components are referred to. This is sufficient. 
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016 
Page 40/113 
  
  
Dose-proportionality and time-dependency 
For lixisenatide, the results regarding dose-proportionality with the combination are line with the results for the 
mono-component which has demonstrated roughly dose-proportional increase in exposure. For insulin glargine 
the results with the combination indicate dose-proportional increase in exposure, although based on a 
between-study comparison. It is agreed that no relevant accumulation of lixisenatide or insulin glargine is to be 
expected when given in combination. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
The inter-individual variability seen with the fixed ratio combination was moderate and in line with what has 
been seen for the mono-components. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Sparse sampling was performed in the phase 2 and 3 studies, but except for the assessment of the effect of 
anti-lixisenatide antibodies on lixisenatide PK in the phase 2 study (see Special populations), the applicant has 
not discussed this data in the Summary of Clinical Pharmacology studies. Since the concentration data reported 
in the phase 3 studies have not been corrected for administered dose it is difficult to draw any conclusions from 
this information. However, considering the minor effects of the PK of lixisenatide and insulin glargine in the fixed 
ratio combination compared to the mono-components and since data with the mono-components indicate 
similar exposure in T2DM patients as in healthy volunteers, no additional PK data in the target population is 
considered necessary.  
Special populations 
No specific studies have been performed in special populations with the new combination except regarding 
influence of anti-lixisenatide antibodies. The results with the fixed ratio combination are in line with data for the 
mono-component, i.e. that following single dose administration the PK profiles of antibody-positive subjects was 
within the range found for antibody-negative subjects, but following multiple-dose administration there was a 
marked increase in exposure in antibody-positive subjects. No additional data on special populations with the 
combination is necessary. The information regarding special populations in the suggested SmPC reflects the 
information from the SmPCs for the mono-components.  
Interactions 
Data from the mono-components are referred to, with a discussion regarding the lower Cmax and later t max 
observed for the combination product on the effect of gastric emptying.  
It is agreed that no interaction between circulating insulin glargine and lixisenatide is expected. However, in 
study BDR11540, where the fixed combination was compared to lixisenatide monotherapy, the exposure of 
lixisenatide was significantly lower with the fixed combination, while comparisons with separate simultaneous 
injections of the mono-components in other studies showed similar exposure of lixisenatide. This might indicate 
that insulin glargine affects lixisenatide exposure due to some other mechanism than by interaction during the 
absorption following subcutaneous injection. In contrast, study PKD12406 did not indicate that the lixisenatide 
exposure would be lower with the fixed combination compared to lixisenatide monotherapy. It is noted that the 
dose-corrected exposure of lixisenatide from the fixed combination appears to be lower in study BDR11540 than 
in the other submitted studies. The reasons for the decreased lixisenatide exposure observed in study 
BDR11540 has not been elucidated, but seems to be an isolated case as compared to the results from the other 
studies and is judged as not critical.

The applicant has agreed to include the same recommendations in the SmPC regarding administration time of 
coadministered drugs as for Lyxumia, i.e. that medicinal products that are particularly dependent on threshold 
concentrations for efficacy and gastro-resistant formulations should be taken at least 1 hour before or 4 hours 
after lixisenatide injection. Although gastric emptying has not returned to normal by 4 hours after administration 
of 20 microgram lixisenatide (given as monotherapy or as fixed-dose combination) the effect on Cmax seen on 
orally administered drugs taken 4 hours after administration of lixisenatide was considered not clinically relevant 
during the assessment of Lyxumia. When given as the fixed-dose combination, it seems to take some additional 
time for the gastric emptying to return to normal compared to monotherapy, but this difference is not 
considered large enough to warrant changes in the SmPC compared to Luxymia. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The insulin glargine/lixisenatide combination is a fixed ratio combination product of a long-acting human insulin 
analogue (insulin glargine) together with a glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist (lixisenatide). Since 
both insulin glargine and lixisenatide are efficacious when given once-daily, both components can be mixed as 
a defined fixed ratio formulation to be delivered by one single injection combining the complementary 
therapeutic benefits of the constituent agents. 
The mechanisms of action for insulin glargine and lixisenatide are well known and no new data have been 
provided. The mechanism of action for lixisenatide is complementary to the mechanism of action of insulin 
glargine with regards to the glucose lowering effect. 
Only one adequately sized PD study (BDR10880) was performed which investigated whether the 
pharmacodynamics of insulin glargine was affected when given in two different fixed combinations with 
lixisenatide as compared to single injections. The study was conducted in patients with T1DM. No significant 
differences were observed with regards to GIR-AUC0-24h or GIRmax. The impact of the combination on the 
pharmacodynamics of lixisenatide was not investigated. These data were supported by a smaller preliminary 
study which also was conducted in T1DM patients. 
The primary pharmacology of insulin glargine has been well characterised within the original MAA and was not 
further investigated with this application. 
The primary pharmacology of lixisenatide has also been well characterised. Data from the lixisenatide 
monotherapy studies PDY12545, ACT6011 and DRI6012 provide supplementary information on the mode of 
action as well as the pharmacodynamic effects of lixisenatide at doses below 20 μg. In addition to effects of 
lixisenatide on glucagon and glucose-induced insulin secretion, a significant effect on gastric emptying has been 
shown for the dose range 5 to 20 μg. According the Applicant, the delay in gastric emptying observed with 
lixisenatide is an important contributor to the effect of lixisenatide on PPG. 
With the FRC, the lowest dose of lixisenatide administered is 5 μg lixisenatide once-daily. Study DRI6012 
investigated the dose range 5-30 μg lixisenatide and a statistically significant effect on change from baseline 
HbA1c, compared to placebo, was observed for all doses. The magnitude of effect was comparable for the 5 and 
10 μg dose, the latter being the recommended starting dose for lixisenatide when used as monotherapy.  
Since dosing of the insulin glargine/lixisenatide combination is to be based on the patient’s individual FPG 
values, the respective dose of lixisenatide will be determined by the insulin glargine dose and the insulin 
glargine/lixisenatide ratio. Therefore, no PK/PD relationship of the combination is required for assessing dose 
recommendations. 
For both insulin glargine and lixisenatide, the relationship between plasma concentration and effect has been 
established.  
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016 
Page 42/113 
  
  
To evaluate the effect of a decrease in Cmax by 16% of lixisenatide at unchanged exposure when administered 
as insulin glargine/lixisenatide combination compared to lixisenatide alone (Study BDR11578), simulations were 
performed applying the population PK/PD model describing the correlation between lixisenatide concentration 
and effect on FPG. The simulation suggested an improved effect of lixisenatide on FPG indicating that the time 
of exposure to lixisenatide rather than maximum concentration determines the efficacy. As discussed in the 
Pharmacokinetics AR, a reduction in lixisenatide Cmax of 22-34% when given as insulin glargine/lixisenatide 
combination compared to separate simultaneous injections as seen in study BDR10880 is considered more 
relevant than the decrease of 16% seen in study BDR11578. Thus, it would be more relevant to simulate the 
effect of a 22-34% decrease in Cmax. However, considering the available data on efficacy and safety for 
lixisenatide, and considering that the final combination formulation was used in the phase 3 studies, a decrease 
in lixisenatide Cmax of 22-34% is not considered clinically relevant.  
A larger model based meta-analysis showed that the combination of lixisenatide and insulin glargine had a 
synergistic effect on the lowering of HbA1c. The magnitude of the synergistic effect was not different compared 
to the combination liraglutide and insulin degludec. 
No data on secondary pharmacology, PD interactions or genetic differences have been provided. As both 
components are well characterised with regards to secondary effects and no important interactions or 
differences in PD due to genetic differences are expected, this is acceptable. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic documentation for the new combination is sufficient. The bioavailability of insulin glargine 
and lixisenatide in the new formulation has been sufficiently characterised, and bridging to clinical pharmacology 
data of the mono-components is acceptable.  
The pharmacodynamic documentation for the new combination is considered sufficient. Data has been provided 
that could justify the use of a lower initial dose of lixisenatide (5 μg) than currently approved, when initiating 
treatment.  
2.4.6.  Clinical efficacy 
Dose-response studies and main clinical studies 
The development program recruited patients with T2DM, including patients insufficiently controlled on one or 
more OADS or insufficiently controlled on basal insulin ± 1 to 2 OADs. The efficacy of the fixed-ratio combination 
in patients with T2DM was assessed in 2229 randomized patients in one Phase 2 proof-of-concept study and two 
pivotal Phase 3 studies (Table 2). 
Dose-response studies 
No dose response study was performed. In the following the Applicant’s rationale for the dose selection for the 
fixed-ratio combination is given. 
Dose selection rationale for the fixed-ratio combination 
The majority of the target population for the FRC is expected to require a daily dose of insulin glargine between 
10 to 60 U. In order to cover the range of 10 to 60 U of insulin glargine while limiting the maximum lixisenatide 
dose to 20 μg, two pens with two different fixed ratios and dose-ranges were used in the Phase 3 studies (Figure 
3). The lower end of the lixisenatide dose range is the minimum dose for glycaemic efficacy as defined in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016 
Page 43/113 
  
  
Phase 2 dose-ranging Study DRI6012 (N=542) where once daily prandial doses from 5 to 20 μg provided 
significantly better HbA1c and PPG reductions than placebo in patients with T2DM. 
The formulation of the FRC used in the Phase 3 studies is identical to the proposed commercial formulation. The 
FRC is provided in a pre-filled disposable SoloStar pen-injector. 
Dosing concept 
The rationale for developing the selected ratios of insulin glargine and lixisenatide was to optimize the 
dose-range of insulin glargine and concomitantly deliver an effective dose of lixisenatide up to its maximum 
approved dose (20 μg) as detailed below. This requires that the FRC is available in 2 different dose ratios (Figure 
3).  
Figure 3 Fixed-ratio combination of lixisenatide and insulin glargine in Pen A and Pen B 
•  Pen A (10 - 40 prefilled pen, peach) contains a sterile solution with 100 U/mL insulin glargine (Lantus, 
100 U/mL) and 50 μg/mL lixisenatide in a ratio of 2 U insulin glargine/1 μg lixisenatide, so that each unit 
of insulin glargine is given with 0.5 μg of lixisenatide. The pen delivers doses from 10 to 40 U in steps of 
1 unit, allowing administration of FRC doses between 10 U/5 μg and 40 U/20 μg. 
•  Pen B (30 - 60 prefilled pen, olive) contains a sterile solution with 100 U/mL insulin glargine (Lantus, 100 
U/mL) and 33 μg/mL lixisenatide in a ratio of 3 U insulin glargine/1 μg lixisenatide, so that each unit of 
insulin glargine is given with 0.33 μg of lixisenatide. The pen delivers doses from 30 to 60 U in steps of 
1 unit, allowing administration of FRC doses between 30 U/10 μg and 60 U/20 μg. 
Treatment Initiation: 
The dose at initiation is primarily based on the approach to use the appropriate insulin dose, without exceeding 
the approved lixisenatide starting dose. 
• 
Insulin-naïve patients initiate treatment at a recommended daily insulin glargine dose of 10 U with a 
corresponding dose of 5 μg of lixisenatide. 
• 
In patients switching from basal insulin to the FRC, different starting doses are available depending on 
previous insulin need: either Pen A (20 U/10 μg or 10 U/5 μg) or Pen B (30 U/10 μg), thereby avoiding 
a major decrease in their current insulin dose. During titration and maintenance: After initiation of the 
FRC and during titration, Pen A is used for total daily doses of 10 to 40 U and Pen B for total daily doses 
of 41 to 60 U. 
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016 
Page 44/113 
  
  
 
• 
For a given daily dose between 30 and 40 units where there is an overlap between Pen A and Pen B 
(Figure 3), the pen which provides the higher dose of lixisenatide (Pen A) is to be chosen as long as it is 
well tolerated. Otherwise (e.g., persistent nausea and/or vomiting), Pen B can be used. For example, in 
the case of persistent GI effects, when a 30 to 40 U daily dose is administered with Pen A (with a 
corresponding lixisenatide dose of 15 to 20 μg), switching to Pen B may allow better GI tolerability: 
while maintaining the same insulin dose, the corresponding doses of lixisenatide is reduced to 10 to 13 
μg. 
The FRC dose is adjusted individually based on the patient’s daily insulin glargine need. Only the dose of insulin 
glargine appears in the pen dosing window. The dose of lixisenatide follows the insulin glargine dose according 
to the chosen fixed-ratio. The human factors studies conducted for the FRC pens confirmed that the information 
provided to users about this dosing concept is understandable and helpful for the intended users to know the 
drug combination contained in each pen. 
Main studies 
The efficacy of the fixed-ratio combination was assessed in two pivotal phase 3 studies. 
EFC12404 (LixiLan-O): A randomised 30 week, active-controlled, open-label, 3-treatment arm, parallel-group 
multicentre study comparing the efficacy and safety of insulin glargine/lixisenatide fixed ratio combination to

Figure 5 EFC12405 study design 
The study comprised 3 periods: 
•  An up to 8-week screening period, which included: 
-  An up to 2-week screening phase. The run-in visit could be performed less than 2 weeks after 
the screening visit if the laboratory data were available. 
-  A 6-week run-in phase with switch to (if appropriate) and/or dose titration/stabilization of 
insulin glargine, continuation of metformin (if appropriate), and discontinuation of sulfonylurea 
(SU), glinides, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, or dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 
(DPP-4) inhibitors if previously taken at Visit 2. 
•  A 30-week open-label randomized treatment period 
•  A 3-day post-treatment safety follow-up period 
• 
The maximum study duration per patient was approximately 39 weeks. 
Study participants  
Both studies included patients with T2DM diagnosed for at least 1 year before the screening visit.  
Study EFC12404 included insulin-naïve patients inadequately controlled on metformin ± a second OAD (at 
least 3 months of treatment). Inclusion criteria at the end of the 4-week run-in period were HbA1c ≥7% and 
≤10%, FPG ≤ 13.9 mmol/L (≤250 mg/dL), and a maximum tolerated metformin dose of ≥1500 mg/day. 
Study EFC12405 included insulin-treated patients inadequately controlled on established basal insulin (at least 
6 months) ± 1 to 2 OADs. Inclusion criteria at the end of the 6-week run-in were HbA1c ≥7% and ≤10%, mean

SMPG for the 7 days prior to randomization of ≤7.8 mmol/L (≤140 mg/dL), and an average insulin glargine daily 
dose ≥20 U and ≤50 U. 
Exclusion criteria related to the safety of patients are detailed in the individual clinical study reports. Major 
criteria were related to a history of metabolic complications of diabetes or standard exclusion criteria for the 
GLP-1 receptor agonist class (amylase or lipase levels >3 upper limit of normal), history of pancreatic disease, 
or a calcitonin level ≥20 pg/mL [≥5.9 pmol/L]. 
Patients with a recent (within 6 months of study entry) history of stroke, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, 
or heart failure requiring hospitalization were excluded. Patients with inadequately controlled hypertension (i.e., 
systolic blood pressure >180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure >95 mmHg) were also excluded. 
Haemoglobinopathy and haemolytic anaemia were also exclusion criteria since these conditions are known to 
potentially affect the evaluation of HbA1c levels. 
Any contraindication to metformin use, according to local labelling (e.g., renal impairment defined as creatinine 
>1.4 mg/dL in women, >1.5 mg/dL in men, or creatinine clearance <60 mL/min) was exclusionary for all 
patients in Study EFC12404 where metformin was a mandatory background therapy and for those patients 
taking metformin in Study EFC12405. 
Treatments 
Patients in each study were provided with protocol-specified training on the pen-injector devices, treatment 
schedules, and dosing algorithms. 
Fixed-ratio combination treatment group 
The FRC was administered subcutaneously once daily (QD) within 1 hour before breakfast. The FRC dose was 
individualized based on clinical response and was titrated based on the patient’s need for insulin (Table 8).  
In study EFC12404 (patients insufficiently controlled on metformin with or without a second OAD), the 
recommended daily starting dose of insulin glargine in insulin-naïve patients is 10 U. Therefore, the daily 
starting dose of the FRC in patients inadequately controlled on OADs was 10 U of insulin glargine/5 μg of 
lixisenatide. This daily dose was maintained during the first week of treatment. 
In study EFC12405 (patients insufficiently controlled on basal insulin ± 1 to 2 OADs), the recommended 
starting dose of lixisenatide when given as a separate injection is 10 μg once daily to be kept stable for 2 weeks. 
Therefore, patients switching from basal insulin to the FRC began treatment at a recommended daily lixisenatide 
dose of 10 μg using either Pen A (20 U glargine) or Pen B (30 U) depending on the insulin glargine dose received 
on the day before randomization as follows: 
• 
• 
If this dose was <30 U, the starting dose of the FRC was 20 U/10 μg (given with Pen A). 
If this dose was ≥30 U, the starting dose of the FRC was 30 U/10 μg (given with Pen B). 
During titration, the choice of Pen A or Pen B was based on the required FRC daily dose: Pen A was to be used 
for daily doses below 40 U and Pen B for doses between 41 and 60 U. In EFC12404, patients needing a daily dose 
of more than 40 U were to be switched to Pen B which delivered doses up to 60 U. In EFC12405, patients who 
initiated treatment with Pen A but subsequently needed a daily insulin dose of more than 40 U were to be 
switched to Pen B. 
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016 
Page 48/113 
  
  
The maximum daily dose was 60 U/20 μg. If a daily dose of the FRC >60 U/20 μg was needed to maintain FPG 
or HbA1c below thresholds defined for rescue therapy, the dose was to be kept at 60 U/20 μg and a rescue 
therapy initiated. 
Insulin glargine 
Insulin glargine (Lantus) is a marketed product and the dose used in this study was in accordance with its 
labelling documents. Doses could be set from 1 to 80 U in steps of 1 U. The fasting SMPG targets, the titration 
algorithm, and titration monitoring were the same as those for the FRC (Table 8). 
In study EFC12404 (patients inadequately controlled on metformin with or without a second OAD), the starting 
dose was 10 U. This daily dose was maintained during the first week of treatment. 
In study EFC12405 (patients inadequately controlled on basal insulin ± 1 to 2 OADs), patients already treated 
with insulin glargine entered the run-in phase with the same dose they received prior to screening. Patients 
receiving a different basal insulin were switched to insulin glargine. Doses were adjusted based on daily 
measured fasting SMPG in order to improve fasting glycaemic control and obtain mean fasting SMPG ≤7.8 
mmol/L (≤140 mg/dL) measured for 7 days before the randomization visit, while avoiding hypoglycaemia. The 
titration procedure was at the discretion of the investigator. 
During the randomized treatment period, patients randomized to insulin glargine had to administer the same 
daily dose on the day of randomization as the day before randomization. Subsequently, the dose was titrated 
once a week using the same algorithm as used for the FRC group (Table 8). 
As the maximum daily dose of FRC was 60 U/20 μg, the comparative insulin glargine stand-alone dose was, in 
both study EFC12404 and study EFC12405, capped at 60 U to best assess the contribution of the lixisenatide 
component to glycaemic control. 
Lixisenatide treatment group (Study EFC12404 only) 
Lixisenatide was self-injected once daily with a pre-filled disposable pen, available for 2 different dose strengths 
of 10 μg (at initiation) and 20 μg (for maintenance). The injection time-point (before breakfast or dinner) was 
determined at the discretion of patient and investigator at randomization and had to be maintained until the end 
of the treatment period. 
Lixisenatide was initiated with QD injections of 10 μg for 2 weeks. The lixisenatide dose was then increased to 
a maintenance dose of 20 μg QD from Week 2 through the end of the treatment period. If the maintenance dose 
of 20 μg QD was not tolerated, the lixisenatide dose could be reduced to 10 μg QD. 
Titration of FRC and insulin glargine 
In each pivotal study, the FRC and insulin glargine treatments were both titrated to a fasting SMPG target of 4.4 
mmol/L to 5.6 mmol/L (80 to100 mg/dL), inclusive, in a treat-to target approach with once-weekly titration. 
Dose changes were based on the median of fasting SMPG values from the previous 3 days, measured by patients 
using glucometers and accessories supplied by the Sponsor, according to Table 8.

Table 8 Dose adjustment algorithm for FRC and insulin glargine 
SMPG = self-monitored plasma glucose 
Titration monitoring was performed to ensure that the protocol-defined insulin dose adjustment algorithm was 
being followed. 
Rescue therapy 
Routine fasting SMPG and central laboratory alerts on FPG and HbA1c levels were used to ensure that glycaemic 
parameters remained below predefined rescue thresholds as defined in the protocols. 
In the case of an FPG or HbA1c level above the protocol-defined thresholds, where no explanation was found 
and/or appropriate actions failed, or if a FRC dose >60 U/20 μg or an insulin glargine dose >60 U was necessary 
to decrease FPG or HbA1c levels to below the predefined thresholds, addition of a rescue therapy was 
recommended. 
For the FRC and insulin glargine treatment groups in both studies, the recommended rescue therapy was the 
addition of short/rapid acting insulin (insulin glulisine when available) to be started as a single daily dose given 
at the main meal of the day (except breakfast in the FRC group). For the lixisenatide group in study EFC12404, 
the choice was at the investigator’s discretion. No other GLP-1 receptor agonist, DPP-4 inhibitor, or basal insulin 
was allowed as rescue therapy in any of the treatment groups in either study. 
Objectives 
Study EFC12404 
The primary objectives of this study were to demonstrate the superiority of the FRC to lixisenatide in HbA1c 
change from baseline to Week 30, and to demonstrate the noninferiority of the FRC to insulin glargine in HbA1c 
change from baseline to Week 30. If noninferiority was shown, statistical superiority of the FRC compared to 
insulin glargine on HbA1c change from baseline to Week 30 was to be tested according to the pre-specified 
testing hierarchy. 
Study EFC12405 
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate the superiority of the FRC to insulin glargine in HbA1c 
change from baseline to Week 30. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint in both pivotal studies (EFC12404 and EFC12405) was change in HbA1c from 
baseline to Week 30.  
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016 
Page 50/113 
  
  
 
The secondary efficacy endpoints in both pivotal studies (EFC12404 and EFC12405) were: 
•  Percentage of patients reaching HbA1c ≤6.5% at Week 30 
•  Percentage of patients reaching HbA1c <7% at Week 30 
•  Change in 2-hour PPG and plasma glucose excursion during a standardized meal test from baseline to 
Week 30 (for all patients in the FRC or insulin glargine groups and patients injecting IMP in the morning 
in the lixisenatide group); the same variables were also assessed at the 30-minutes and 1-hour time 
points  
Note: 30-minute, 1-hour, or 2-hour plasma glucose excursion = 30-minute, 1-hour, or 2-hour PPG 
value – plasma glucose value obtained 30 minutes prior to the start of meal and before IMP 
administration if IMP was injected before breakfast 
•  Change in body weight from baseline to Week 30 
•  Change in FPG from baseline to Week 30 
•  Change in 7-point SMPG profiles from baseline to Week 30 (each time point and average daily value) 
•  Percentage of patients reaching HbA1c <7% with no body weight gain at Week 30 
•  Percentage of patients reaching HbA1c <7% at Week 30 with no documented symptomatic 
hypoglycemia (plasma glucose ≤70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L] during the 30-week open-label treatment 
period) 
•  Percentage of patients reaching HbA1c <7% with no body weight gain at Week 30 and with no 
documented symptomatic hypoglycemia (plasma glucose ≤70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L]) during the 30-week 
open-label treatment period 
•  Percentage of patients requiring rescue therapy during the 30-week open-label treatment period 
In study EFC12404, the insulin glargine dose at Week 30 (in the FRC group and insulin glargine group only) was 
included as a secondary endpoint, whereas change in daily dose of insulin glargine dose from baseline to Week 
30, was included as a secondary endpoint in study EFC12405. 
In both Phase 3 trials, documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia was defined by the protocol as an event during 
which typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia were accompanied by measured plasma glucose of ≤3.9 mmol/L 
(≤70 mg/dL). Severe symptomatic hypoglycaemia was defined as an event requiring assistance of another 
person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. 
Sample size 
In both studies the sample size calculations were based on the primary efficacy variable change in HbA1c from 
baseline to week 30.  
In study EFC12404 the following assumptions were made: 
•  A common standard deviation of 1.1 % 
•  A true difference between FRC and insulin glargine of zero and a non-inferiority margin of 0.3 % 
•  A 0.4 % mean difference between FRC and lixisenatide 
•  A t-test at a 1-sided 2.5 % significance level with at least 95 % power 
Based on these assumptions and a randomisation ratio of 2:2:1, 1125 patients were needed, 450 patients in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016 
Page 51/113 
  
  
FRC and insulin glargine arm respectively and 225 patients in the lixisenatide group. 
In study EFC12405, 350 patients per group were needed assuming a mean difference between the FRC and 
insulin glargine of 0.4%, a common standard deviation of 1.1% and a t-test at a 2-sided 5% significance level 
with at least 95% power.  
Randomisation 
At the end of the screening period, eligible patients were centrally randomised (both studies) (using permuted 
block randomisation schedule) via an interactive voice/web response system (IVRS/IWRS).  
In study EFC12404 patients were randomised in a 2:2:1 ratio to FRC, insulin glargine or lixisenatide stratified 
by HbA1c value at visit 4 (week -1) (<8%, ≥8%) and second oral anti-diabetic drug (OAD) use at screening 
(yes, no). 
In study EFC12405 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to FRC or insulin glargine, stratified by value of 
HbA1c at Visit 5 (Week -1) (<8%, ≥8%) and metformin use at screening (yes, no). 
Blinding (masking) 
Both studies were open-label because of differences in the type and number of pens used to administer the FRC, 
insulin glargine and, in study EFC12404, lixisenatide. Primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints 
(biochemical in nature) were measured in a central laboratory. The Investigator and the Sponsor were not to 
have any access to HbA1c data or to data of the standardized meal test endpoints obtained after the baseline 
visit until the end of the study.  
The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) received unblinded, closed reports from an independent statistician, to 
be handled strictly confidentially. Additional external and independent committees involved in the studies 
(ARAC, CAC and PSAC) reviewed and adjudicated events in a blinded manner. 
Statistical methods 
In both Phase 3 pivotal studies the statistical methodology was similar although differed with respect to 
non-inferiority/superiority testing of the primary efficacy endpoint and the order of hierarchical testing for the 
key secondary endpoints. 
Primary superiority hypotheses, FRC vs lixisenatide (EFC12404) and FRC vs insulin glargine (EFC12405) 
respectively, was tested at a 2-sided 5% significance level. In study EFC12404, non-inferiority of the FRC vs 
insulin glargine was to have been demonstrated if the upper bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference 
between the FRC and insulin glargine in change in HbA1c from baseline to week 30 was ≤0.3%. 
Efficacy analyses were performed on the mITT population using all efficacy assessments collected during the 
study, including those obtained after IMP discontinuation or introduction of rescue therapy. It was initially 
planned to use only on-treatment data. This approach was changed in both studies through study protocol 
amendment 1 (dated 09 July 2014, EFC12404 and 03 July 2014, EFC12405).  
The mITT population was defined as all randomised patients who had both a baseline assessment and at least 
one post-baseline assessment. The definition of the mITT was also changed with amendment 1 in that the 
requirement “received at least 1 dose of IMP” was removed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016 
Page 52/113 
  
  
The analyses of the primary endpoint were performed using a mixed-effect model with repeated measures 
(MMRM), under the missing at random framework. The MMRM model included treatment group, randomisation 
strata, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction and country as fixed effects, and baseline HbA1c value-by-visit 
interaction as a covariate. The key sensitivity analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint used the same MMRM 
model including only the scheduled HbA1c measurements collected during the on-treatment period (i.e., 
excluding HbA1c values collected after IMP discontinuation or the introduction of rescue therapy). Additional 
sensitivity analyses included e.g. an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with missing data imputed by the last 
observation carried forward (LOCF).  
In both studies a step-down testing procedure was applied for the primary and a number of selected secondary 
endpoints in order to control the type I error. In study EFC12404 testing on secondary endpoints was to continue 
only when both co-primary hypotheses had been established. In study EFC12404 the step-down testing 
procedure also included a test of superiority, FRC vs insulin glargine, on the primary endpoint.  
All continuous secondary efficacy endpoints were analysed using the same MMRM approach as used for primary 
analyses except for 30-minute, 1-hour, 2-hour PPG and plasma glucose excursion endpoints that was analysed 
using ANCOVA (LOCF). All categorical secondary efficacy endpoints were analysed using a stratified 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. Sensitivity analyses of selected secondary endpoints were performed using 
scheduled measurements collected during the on-treatment period (excluding those collected after introduction 
of rescue therapy). 
 A number of subgroup analyses were pre-planned. There was no formal efficacy interim analysis planned or 
performed in any of the two pivotal studies. 
With the study protocol amendment 1 dated 09 July 2014 (EFC12404) and 03 July 2014 (EFC12405) a few 
additional statistical changes were implemented (besides those already mentioned above). They concerned e.g. 
the modification or adding of sensitivity analyses following the change in the primary analysis and in study 
EFC12404, a few changes with regard to the step-down testing procedure. In principal all changes made were 
due to health authority´s requests or comments.  
The final version of the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for study EFC12404 was dated 12-Mar-2015 (version 2). 
The final version of the SAP for study EFC12405 was dated 13-Mar-2015 (version 2). A few analyses/summaries 
were added after database lock, in both studies post hoc analyses intended to be supportive were performed; 
key efficacy endpoints (e.g., HbA1c, 2-hour PPG excursions, and body weight) and documented symptomatic 
hypoglycaemia were also evaluated by final insulin and lixisenatide dose levels. According to both SAPs the 
database (for each of the study, respectively) was planned to be locked approximately 4 weeks after last patient 
last visit. No actual dates have been found. Considering that the latest version of both SAPs was dated before 
each of the studies were completed this is not considered to be an issue.

Results - Study EFC12404 
Participant flow  
Figure 6 Study EFC12404: Patient disposition 
a One patient was randomized to the lixisenatide group but did not receive open-label study treatment. 
The percentage of patients completing the open-label on-treatment period in the FRC group (93.8%) was similar 
to the insulin glargine group (94.2%) and was higher than in the lixisenatide group (87.6%).  
Conduct of the study 
The clinical study protocol version 1 was dated 19 November 2013. There was one substantial protocol 
amendment dated 09 July 2014. Percentages of patients with major or critical efficacy deviations potentially 
impacting efficacy analyses were low and similar for the 3 treatment groups. 
One site was closed due to non-compliance; the 5 patients concerned; 2 (0.4%) and 3 (0.6%) in the FRC and 
insulin glargine arm respectively, were transferred to another site (site 710005), and continued the study as 
planned. Due to the limited number of patients recruited at this site (5 of 1170 randomized patients), no 
sensitivity analyses were performed. 
Baseline data 
Baseline demographics were well-balanced across treatment groups. The overall population was balanced by 
gender and was predominantly Caucasian (90.1%) with a mean age of 58.4 years. The population had a mean 
baseline body mass index (BMI) of 31.7 overall (BMI range 19-42) and 63.4% of patients had a baseline BMI 
≥30.0, indicating that the majority of the population was obese.

Medical history was generally similar for the 3 treatment groups. Almost all patients (97.1%) in the randomized 
population presented with at least 1 previous disease or history of surgery. The following SOCs were affected 
most frequently: vascular disorders (76.7%), metabolism and nutrition disorders (75.1%), and surgical and 
medical procedures (45.6%). 
The majority of patients (88.2%) in the randomized population had a history of cerebrovascular events or 
cardiovascular risk factors, with hypertension being the most common (74.9% of patients) followed by 
dyslipidaemia (65.0% of patients). 
Most patients (86.1%) did not smoke at screening and 53.1% of patients did not drink any alcohol in the last 12 
months before screening. 
A low percentage of patients (3.8%) had clinically significant abnormal physical examination findings at 
screening. 
Screening and/or baseline characteristics related to diabetes were comparable in the 3 treatment groups and 
indicative of a population in poor glycaemic control that would benefit from insulin initiation. Overall, the mean 
duration of diabetes was 8.8 years with a mean HbA1c of 8.2% at screening. Metformin was a mandatory 
background therapy (mean daily dose at baseline: 2249.8 mg). Importantly, the majority of patients were using 
2 OADs at screening (57.9%), with 53.9% using a sulfonylurea as second OAD at screening. For patients using 
2 OADs, the overall mean duration of use was 4.2 years. 
Numbers analysed 
Of the 1170 randomised patients, 3 patients (1 patient from each treatment group) were excluded from the 
mITT population because they did not have any post baseline efficacy assessments. 
One patient randomised to the lixisenatide group requested not to be treated and was excluded from the safety 
population.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint - Mean change in HbA1c (%) from baseline to Week 30 
The primary objectives of the study were met as the non-inferiority and then statistical superiority according to 
the pre-specified testing hierarchy of the FRC compared to insulin glargine on HbA1c change from baseline to 
Week 30 was demonstrated as well as statistical superiority of the FRC over lixisenatide. 
The changes from baseline to Week 30 in HbA1c were -1.63% for the FRC group, -1.34% for the insulin glargine 
group, and -0.85% for the lixisenatide group, reaching mean HbA1c values of 6.50%, 6.81%, and 7.31% at 
Week 30, respectively (Table 10).

use at screening (Yes, No), visit (Week 8, 12, 24, and 30), treatment-by-visit interaction, and country as fixed effects, and 
baseline HbA1c value-by-visit interaction as a covariate. 
Countries with fewer than 5 randomized patients were grouped with the country with the lowest number of randomized 
patients that is 5 or more. 
The analysis included all scheduled measurements obtained during the study, including those obtained after IMP 
discontinuation or introduction of rescue therapy. 
Included are patients who have measurements at baseline and post-baseline.

Secondary endpoints 
Proportion of responders with HbA1c <7.0% or ≤6.5% at Week 30 
The percentage of patients reaching HbA1c <7.0% was higher in the FRC group (73.7%) compared to both the 
insulin glargine group (59.4%) and the lixisenatide group (33.0%). The proportion difference was 14.3% 
(95%CI, 8.4% to 20.2%; p<0.0001) versus insulin glargine and 40.6% (95%CI [33.6% to 47.6%]; p<0.0001) 
versus lixisenatide. 
The percentage of patients reaching HbA1c ≤6.5% was also higher in the FRC group (55.8%) compared to both 
the insulin glargine group (39.5%) and the lixisenatide group (19.3%). The proportion difference was 16.4% 
(95%CI, 10.1% to 22.6%; p<0.0001) versus insulin glargine and 36.4% (95%CI, 29.8% to 43.0%; p<0.0001) 
versus lixisenatide. 
Prandial glucose control during a standardized meal test 
Treatment with the FRC significantly improved postprandial glycaemic control after a standardized liquid 
breakfast compared to insulin glargine, as shown by the results of change from baseline in 2-hour PPG 
excursions. The LS mean change was -2.31 mmol/L (-41.7 mg/dL) in the FRC group versus -0.2 mmol/L (-3.2 
mg/dL) in the glargine group, with a LS mean treatment difference of -2.1 mmol/L (-38.4 mg/dL) (95%CI [-2.5 
to -1.8]; p<0.0001, Test 1 in the testing order). 
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016 
Page 57/113 
  
  
 
 
At Week 30, mean 2-hour PPG excursions were 2.8 mmol/L (50.7 mg/dL) for the FRC, 4.8 mmol/L (86.5 mg/dL) 
for insulin glargine, and 1.7 mmol/L (30.6 mg/dL) for lixisenatide.  
There was also a substantially greater reduction from baseline in 2-hour PPG for the FRC as compared to both 
insulin glargine and lixisenatide (although these comparisons were not included in the statistical testing order). 
The LS mean change from baseline was -5.7 mmol/L (-102.4 mg/dL) for the FRC, -3.3 mmol/L (-59.6 mg/dL) for 
insulin glargine, and -4.6 mmol/L (-82.6 mg/dL) for lixisenatide.  
At Week 30, mean pre-injection and pre-meal plasma glucose (PG) concentrations were similar between the FRC 
group and the insulin glargine group and higher in the lixisenatide group. Mean PG concentrations at all 
postprandial time points were lower in the FRC group than in the insulin glargine group and the lixisenatide 
group. In the FRC group and the lixisenatide group, the highest values were reached 1 hour after the start of the 
meal and then decreased while values continued to increase for up to 2 hours post-meal in the insulin glargine 
group (Figure 8).

Change in body weight from baseline to Week 30 
Body weight decreased in the FRC and lixisenatide groups and increased in the insulin glargine group, with LS 
mean changes from baseline to Week 30 of -0.3, -2.3 and +1.1 kg for each group. There was a statistically 
significant difference in body weight change between the FRC and insulin glargine groups with a treatment 
difference of -1.4 kg (95% CI [-1.9 to -0.9]; p<0.0001, Test 2 in the testing order). 
Change in FPG from baseline to Week 30 
The reduction from baseline to Week 30 in FPG was significantly greater in the FRC group (-3.46 mmol/L) 
compared to the lixisenatide group (-1.50 mmol/L), treatment difference -1.96 mmol/L (95%CI [-2.25 to 
-1.68]; p<0.0001, Test 3 in the testing order). Starting from comparable baseline levels, the reduction in FPG 
was similar in the FRC (-3.46 mmol/L) and insulin glargine groups (-3.27 mmol/L).  
Mean FPG values at Week 30 were 6.32 mmol/L in the FRC and 6.53 mmol/L insulin glargine groups (113.9 
mg/dL and 117.6 mg/dL). In the lixisenatide treated group mean FPG values at Week 30 were 8.27 mmol/L 
(148.9 mg/dL). 
Change in the daily average of the 7-point SMPG from baseline to Week 30  
Patients treated with the FRC had a statistically significantly greater reduction in average 7-point SMPG (-3.35 
mmol/L [-60.36 mg/dL]) compared to patients in the lixisenatide group (-1.95 mmol/L [-35.11 mg/dL]; 
difference -1.40 mmol/L [-25.24 mg/dL], p<0.0001, Test 4 in the testing order) and compared to patients in the 
insulin glargine group (-2.66 mmol/L [-47.87 mg/dL]; difference -0.69 mmol/L [-12.49 mg/dL], p<0.0001, Test 
7 in the testing order).  
A graphic display of the 7-point SMPG profiles shows that values at all Week 30 time points were notably reduced 
from baseline and lower in the FRC group compared to the insulin glargine and lixisenatide groups. Exceptions 
were the similar pre-breakfast values for the FRC and insulin glargine groups, as observed for FPG values 
measured by the central laboratory (Figure 9). Importantly, the SMPG profiles at Week 30 demonstrate that 
improvement in glycaemic control was provided throughout the day in the FRC group.

Composite endpoints  
• 
Percent of patients reaching an HbA1c <7.0% with no body weight gain  
A statistically significantly higher proportion of patients reached this composite endpoint at Week 30 in the FRC 
group (43.2%) than in the insulin glargine group (25.1%); the treatment difference was 18.1% (95% CI [12.2% 
to 24.0%]; p<0.0001; Test 5 in the testing order). The proportion of patients reaching this composite endpoint 
was also markedly higher in the FRC group compared to the lixisenatide group (27.9%), and the treatment 
difference was 15.2% (95% CI [8.05%, 22.39%] excluding 0).  
• 
Percent of patients reaching HbA1c <7.0% with no body weight gain at Week 30 and with no 
documented symptomatic hypoglycemia during the study  
Significantly more patients in the FRC group reached the triple composite endpoint than did patients in the 
insulin glargine group (31.8% versus 18.9% respectively, with a treatment difference of 12.98% (95%CI [7.5% 
to 18.5%]; p<0.0001; Test 8 in the testing order). The proportion of patients reaching this triple composite 
endpoint was also numerically higher in the FRC group compared to the lixisenatide group (26.2%).  
Insulin glargine dose  
At Week 30, LS mean daily insulin doses were comparable in the FRC and glargine groups: 39.8 U in the FRC 
group and 40.3 U in the insulin glargine group (Test 9 in the testing order), corresponding to a mean daily insulin 
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016 
Page 60/113 
  
  
  
 
dose adjusted by body weight of 0.45 U/kg in both groups. In both groups, the mean daily dose rose steadily and 
concordantly over the treatment period.  
At the end of the treatment period, the proportion of patients taking doses ≥30 U was comparable between 
groups, 71.2% in the FRC group and 70.3% in the insulin glargine group. The maximum allowed dose of 60 U 
was taken by 15.6% of patients in the FRC group and 20.1% in the insulin glargine group. Two hundred and forty 
(51.2%) of patients were using Pen A, and 227 (48.4%) had switched and were using Pen B at the end of the 
treatment period.  
Lixisenatide dose  
In the FRC group, at Week 30, the mean daily dose of lixisenatide was 15.5 μg. The majority of patients (58.6%) 
were receiving ≥15 μg to ≤20 μg of lixisenatide at the end of the treatment period (Table 11).

In the lixisenatide group, the majority of patients (88.8%) were receiving the recommended daily maintenance 
 Note: 
dose of 20 μg lixisenatide at the end of the treatment period.  
Percent of patients receiving rescue therapy  
Fewer patients received rescue therapy in the FRC group (3.6%) and the insulin glargine group (3.4%) (both 
groups capped at 60 U/day) as compared to the lixisenatide group (12.4%).  
Hypoglycaemia  
Comparable proportions of patients in the FRC (25.6%) and insulin glargine groups (23.6%) reported at least 
one event of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia (PG ≤3.9 mmol/L [≤70 mg/dL]) as defined by the 
protocol. In the lixisenatide treated group, 6.4% of patients reported at least one event of symptomatic 
hypoglycaemia. 
The corresponding number of events per patient-year was comparable between groups, 1.44 and 1.22 for the 
FRC and insulin glargine, respectively. One event of severe symptomatic hypoglycaemia was reported during 
the study and occurred in the insulin glargine group. In the lixisenatide treated group, the number of events per 
patient-year was 0.34. 
When using the PG cut off of <3.3 mmol/L (60 mg/dL), the incidence of documented symptomatic 
hypoglycaemia with the FRC was 14.1%, with insulin glargine 10.7%, and with lixisenatide 2.6%, with 
corresponding numbers of events per-patient year of 0.25, 0.19, and 0.05, respectively.

Participant flow  
Figure 10 Study EFC12405: Patient disposition 
The percentage of patients permanently discontinuing IMP during the open-label treatment period was higher in 
the FRC group (29 patients [7.9%]) than in the insulin glargine group (10 patients [2.7%]). The main reasons 
for IMP discontinuation were due to AEs (3.3% in the FRC group and 0.8% in the insulin glargine group) and 
other reasons (3.3% in the FRC group and 1.6% in the insulin glargine group). 
Conduct of the study 
There was one substantial amendment to the clinical study protocol dated 03 July 2014. Percentages of patients 
with major or critical efficacy deviations potentially impacting efficacy analyses were low. 
Baseline data  
Baseline demographics were well-balanced between treatment groups. The overall population was balanced by 
gender and was primarily Caucasian (91.7%) with 5.2% of Black patients and a mean age of 60 years. This was 
a population with a mean screening BMI of 31.3 kg/m2 (BMI range 21-42) and with 58.6% of patients having a 
mean BMI ≥30 kg/m2, indicating that the majority of the population was obese.  
The majority of patients (92.0%) in the randomized population had a history of cerebrovascular events or 
cardiovascular risk factors, with hypertension being the most common (80.9% of patients) followed by 
dyslipidaemia (70.0% of patients). No major differences were observed between treatment groups.

The smoking and drinking habits were similar between treatment groups. Most patients (63.5%) did not smoke 
at screening and 51.1% of patients did not drink any alcohol in the last 12 months before screening. 
A low percentage of patients (3.8%) had clinically significant physical examination findings at screening. No 
major differences were observed between treatment groups. 
Screening and/or baseline characteristics related to diabetes were comparable in the 2 treatment groups. At 
screening, the mean duration of diabetes was 12.1 years with a mean HbA1c of 8.5% in both groups. At 
screening, the duration of basal insulin use was approximately 3 years in both groups, and the majority of all 
patients (64.4%) were receiving insulin glargine as their basal insulin. Patients receiving any basal insulin other 
than insulin glargine were switched to once daily insulin glargine at the start of run-in period. The overall mean 
daily dose of insulin glargine was approximately 29 U at the start of run-in and had increased to approximately 
35 U at the time of randomization.  
The percentage of patients using metformin at screening was comparable between groups with metformin used 
by 89.4% of all patients. The percentage of patients using 2 OADs at screening was 43.6% and 37.9% in the FRC 
and insulin glargine groups, respectively, with the most frequent combination being metformin plus a SU.  
The inclusion criteria allowed patients pre-treated with basal insulin without metformin to be included in the 
trial. At randomization the proportion of patients using basal insulin alone was 11.4% (n=84/736).  
Numbers analysed 
The mITT population included 731 patients (99.3%) out of the 736 patients randomized; 5 patients (1 in the FRC 
group and 4 in the insulin glargine group) were excluded from the mITT population because they did not have 
any post-baseline efficacy data.  
The safety population included 730 patients; 6 patients were randomized but not treated whereof 5 were not 
eligible and randomised by mistake, and 1 patient withdrew informed consent.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint - Change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 30 
The primary objective of the study was met as statistical superiority of the FRC over insulin glargine was 
demonstrated in change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 30. 
A switch to insulin glargine from other basal insulins and/or dose titration during the run-in decreased mean 
HbA1c from 8.53% at screening to 8.08% at baseline (post run-in) in all patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016 
Page 63/113 
  
  
The changes in HbA1c from baseline to Week 30 were -1.13% for the FRC group and -0.62% for the insulin 
glargine group, reaching mean HbA1c levels of 6.94% and 7.48%, respectively (Table 13). The difference 
between the 2 treatment groups was -0.52% (95% CI: -0.633%, -0.397%). Statistical superiority of the FRC 
over insulin glargine was demonstrated (p<0.0001).

In the subgroup treated with basal insulin alone at randomisation, the change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 
30 was -1.27% for the FRC group (n=41) and -0.42% for the insulin glargine group (n=43). The difference 
between the 2 treatment groups was -0.85% (95% CI: -1.197%, -0.499%). 
Secondary endpoints  
Percentage of patients reaching HbA1c ≤6.5% or <7% at Week 30  
At Week 30, the percentage of patients reaching HbA1c <7% was markedly higher in the FRC group (54.9%) 
compared with the insulin glargine group (29.6%), proportion difference 25.5% (95%CI [18.9% to 32.1%]; 
p<0.0001).  
This was also the case for the percentage of patients reaching HbA1c ≤6.5% (33.9% versus 14.2%), proportion 
difference 20.0% (95%CI [13.9% to 25.6 %]; p<0.0001).  
In the subgroup treated with basal insulin alone at randomisation the responder rate (HbA1c <7%) was 56.1% 
in the FRC group (n=41) compared to 16.3% in the insulin glargine group (n=43), proportion difference 39.2% 
((95%CI [20.7% to 57.6%]). 
Prandial glucose control during a standardized meal test  
Treatment with the FRC significantly improved postprandial glycaemic control after a standardized liquid 
breakfast in comparison to insulin glargine as shown by the results of change from baseline in 2-hour glucose

excursions. The LS mean change was -3.9 mmol/L (-70.2 mg/dL) in the FRC group versus -0.5 mmol/L (-8.4 
mg/dL) in the glargine group with a LS mean treatment difference of -3.4 mmol/L (-61.8 mg/dL) (95%CI [-3.92 
to -2.94]; p<0.0001; Test 1 in the testing order).  
Mean 2-hour glucose excursions were 3.1 mmol/L (56.0 mg/dL) for the FRC and 6.7 mmol/L (120.8 mg/dL) for 
insulin glargine.  
There was also a substantially greater reduction from baseline in 2-hour PPG for the FRC compared to insulin 
glargine (although this comparison was not included in the statistical testing order) (LS mean treatment 
difference: -3.3 mmol/L [-60.0 mg/dL], 95% CI: 3.89 mmol/L to 2.77 mmol/L [-70.07 mg/dL to -49.97 
mg/dL]). Mean 2-hour PPG values at Week 30 were 9.9 mmol/L (178.6 mg/dL) for the FRC and 13.4 mmol/L 
(241.7 mg/dL) for insulin glargine.  
At Week 30, mean PPG concentrations were markedly lower at all postprandial time points in the FRC group 
compared to the insulin glargine group (Figure 12). In the FRC group, a plateau was reached 1 hour after the 
start of the meal while values continued to increase for up to 2 hours in the insulin glargine group.

Change in body weight from baseline to Week 30  
Mean body weight decreased in the FRC group by 0.67 kg and increased in the insulin glargine group by 0.70 kg. 
The LS mean treatment difference (-1.37 kg) between the two groups was statistically significant (95% CI 
[-1.808 to -0.930]; p<0.0001; Test 2 in the testing order).  
Change in the daily average of the 7-point SMPG from baseline to Week 30  
Patients treated with the FRC had a statistically significantly greater reduction in average 7-point SMPG (-1.50 
mmol/L [-27.05 mg/dL]) compared to patients treated with insulin glargine (-0.60 mmol/L [-10.88 mg/dL]). 
The LS mean difference between the treatment groups was -0.90 mmol/L (-16.16 mg/dL) (p<0.0001; Test 3 in 
the testing order).  
Figure 13 presents a graphic display of the 7-point SMPG profiles. Post-breakfast SMPG values at Week 30 time 
points had a clear reduction from baseline in the FRC treatment group. Values at all Week 30 time points but one 
were lower in the FRC group compared to the insulin glargine group. The one exception was observed 
pre-breakfast, when values were similar in the 2 groups, (as seen for FPG values measured by the central 
laboratory), which reflects the same titration to fasting SMPG target applied in both groups.

Composite endpoints  
• 
Percent of patients reaching an HbA1c <7.0% with no body weight gain  
A significantly higher percentage of patients reached the composite endpoint in the FRC group (34.2%) 
compared to the insulin glargine group (13.4%), with a treatment difference of 20.8% (95%CI [15.0% to 
26.7%]; p<0.0001; Test 4 in the testing order).  
• 
Percent of patients reaching HbA1c <7.0% with no body weight gain at Week 30 and with no 
documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia during the study  
Notably, more than twice as many patients in the FRC group (19.9%) reached the triple composite endpoint as 
compared to patients in the insulin glargine group (9.0%). The treatment difference was 10.94% (95% CI 
[5.93% to 15.96%]; Test 6 in the testing order). Inferential statistics were exploratory on this endpoint because 
the preceding test in the hierarchical testing order (change from baseline in dose of insulin) was not significant.  
Insulin glargine dose  
A comparable increase from baseline in the LS mean daily dose of insulin glargine was observed in both 
treatment groups (10.6 U in the FRC group and 10.9 U in the insulin glargine group) with an equivalent mean 
daily dose at Week 30 of approximately 47 U. Mean daily insulin dose adjusted by body weight was 0.54 U/kg in 
both groups.  
As specified by the protocol and in order to comply with the recommended lixisenatide starting dose of 10 
μg/day, investigators were to initiate treatment in the FRC group with a dose of either 20 U/10 μg with Pen A or 
30 U/10 μg with Pen B, depending on the patient’s previous daily basal insulin dose. This was reflected in a 
transient drop from baseline in the mean daily insulin glargine dose, followed by a steady rise (Figure 14). 
Beginning at Week 20, the mean daily dose began to plateau in both groups.  
Because this endpoint was not statistically significant (Test 5 in the testing order), further testing was not 
performed on the other endpoints pre-specified in the hierarchical testing order.

Week -6 = First Week of run-in, B=Baseline, LOCF = Last observation carried forward, INS/LIXI = Fixed Ratio Combination, 
INS = Insulin Glargine  
The analysis included scheduled measurements obtained up to the date of last injection of IMP, including those obtained after 
introduction of rescue therapy. 
At the end of the treatment period, the largest proportion of patients in any one dose-range were those taking 
>40 U to ≤60 U of insulin glargine, 60.8% in the FRC group and 64.7% in the insulin glargine group. The 
maximum allowed dose of 60 U was taken by comparable proportions of patients in the FRC (27.1%) and insulin 
glargine (30.7%) groups. One hundred (27.4%) of patients were using Pen A and 264 (72.3%) were using Pen 
B at the end of the treatment period.  
Lixisenatide dose  
In the FRC group, the mean daily dose at Week 30 was 16.9 μg. The majority of patients (68.8%) were receiving 
≥15 μg to ≤20 μg of lixisenatide at the end of the treatment period.  
Fasting plasma glucose  
Starting from comparable baseline levels, the reduction in FPG was similar in the FRC and insulin glargine 
groups. The mean FPGs at Week 30 were 6.78 mmol/L and 6.69 mmol/L (122.1 mg/dL and 120.5 mg/dL). 
Percent of patients receiving rescue therapy  
The percentage of patients requiring rescue therapy was low in both groups and was lower for those receiving 
the FRC (2.7%) as compared to those receiving insulin glargine (6.0%) (dose capped at 60 U in both groups).

Hypoglycaemia  
Comparable proportions of patients in each group reported at least one event of documented symptomatic 
hypoglycaemia (PG ≤3.9 mmol/L [≤70 mg/dL]): 40.0% and 42.5% in the FRC and insulin glargine groups, 
respectively. The number of events per patient-year was lower in the FRC group compared to the insulin glargine 
group (3.03 versus 4.22). There were 4 patients with severe symptomatic hypoglycaemia in the FRC group and 
1 patient in the glargine group. Of these, 3 patients in the FRC group had alternative factors that may have 
contributed to the episodes of severe hypoglycaemia, including dementia, unusual amount of physical activity, 
and lack of food intake prior to the event.  
When using the PG cut-off of <3.3 mmol/L (60 mg/dL), the incidence of documented symptomatic 
hypoglycaemia with the FRC was 24.4% and with insulin glargine 22.7%, with the corresponding number of 
events per-patient year of 0.44 and 0.40, respectively.

Although the conclusion is based on a limited number of patients, there is no indication of a difference in benefit 
risk balance for the FRC when used in patients ≥75 years compared to younger patients. This is further 
supported by data from the lixisenatide file. 
No dedicated studies in special populations were performed. This is acceptable considering that both 
components have been well characterised with regards to renal and hepatic impairment.  
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses AND meta-analysis) 
A pre-specified meta-analysis of change from baseline to Week 30 in HbA1c using pooled data from the 2 pivotal 
Phase 3 studies was performed by subgroup. Change from baseline was highly consistent across baseline 
categories including race, ethnicity, gender, age, baseline BMI, and baseline HbA1c (Table 16). 
Patients that were ≥65 years of age had a treatment difference between the FRC and insulin glargine of -0.49 
compared to a treatment difference of - 0.29 for patients <50 years of age and -0.35 for patients ≥50 and <65 
years of age.  
In patients ≥65 years, the greater reduction in HbA1c in the FRC group as compared to the insulin glargine group 
was not accompanied by an increased risk of hypoglycaemia in either the FRC or insulin glargine groups.  
Change from baseline by age was consistent across all age categories in the meta-analysis as well as in 
EFC12405 (insulin-pretreated population). In EFC12404 (insulin-naïve population), in patients <50 years of age 
(n=85), the difference in HbA1c change from baseline between the FRC group and the insulin glargine group was 
-0.06% and the corresponding 95% CI included zero. In older patients, the differences were -0.32% (≥50 to 
<65 years, n=250) and -0.40% in the elderly (≥65 years, n=132) and the corresponding 95% CIs excluded 
zero.  
Change from baseline by BMI was consistent across the two categories (<30 and ≥30) in the meta-analysis for 
the FRC. The treatment difference was however slightly higher for patients with BMI <30 compared to patients 
with BMI ≥30 (-0.46 and -0.33, respectively).

Supportive study 
Study ACT12374 (Phase 2 proof-of-concept study)  
Study ACT12374 was a 1:1 randomized, 24-week, open-label, 2-arm, parallel-group, multicenter study 
comparing the efficacy and safety of the FRC versus insulin glargine in combination with metformin. 
Randomization (N=323) was stratified by screening HbA1c value (<8%, ≥8%) and screening body mass index 
(BMI) (<30 kg/m2, ≥30 kg/m2). The study was comprised of an up to 2-week screening period and a 24-week 
treatment period.  
Major inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of T2DM for at least 1 year, treatment with metformin at a stable dose 
of at least 1.5 g/day for at least 3 months prior to screening, no use of insulin within the previous 6 months, 
screening HbA1c ≥7.0% or ≤10.0%, and screening FPG ≤13.9 mmol/L (≤250 mg/dL).  
The fixed-ratio (2 U of insulin glargine/1 μg of lixisenatide) allowed daily insulin glargine doses ranging from 10 
to 60 U and concomitant administration of between 5 μg and 30 μg lixisenatide. Both treatments were 
administered QD in the morning within 1 hour before breakfast. If a 60 U/30 μg dose was not sufficient to 
maintain FPG or HbA1c levels below thresholds values predefined for rescue therapy, the dose was to be kept at 
60 U/30 μg and a rescue therapy was to be initiated. In the insulin glargine group there was no cap on the dose.

Results  
The percentage of patients completing the 24-week treatment period was high in both treatment groups, 93.2% 
and 98.1%, for the FRC and insulin glargine groups, respectively.  
The duration of diabetes, duration of metformin use, and average daily metformin dose at baseline were 
comparable between treatment groups. Overall, the median duration of diabetes was 5.4 years. Glycaemic 
parameters at baseline were generally similar in the 2 treatment groups with comparable mean (standard 
deviation [SD]) baseline values for HbA1c, 8.05% (0.80%) for the FRC and 8.01% (0.80%) for insulin glargine.  
The FRC was non-inferior to insulin glargine. Statistical superiority of the FRC over insulin glargine was then 
tested and also demonstrated. The LS mean changes from baseline (standard error [SE]) to Week 24 were 
-1.82% (0.058%) for the FRC and -1.64% (0.057%) for insulin glargine, reaching mean (SD) HbA1c levels of 
6.31% (0.72%) and 6.47% (0.64%), respectively, with a LS mean treatment difference of -0.17% (p=0.0130). 
Mean HbA1c decreased steadily over time in both groups with the lowest value observed at the last 
measurement (Week 24). 
After a standardized meal at Week 24, treatment with the FRC significantly improved PPG control in comparison 
to insulin glargine.  
• 
• 
The FRC provided a significantly greater LS mean reduction from baseline in 2-hour PPG values versus 
insulin glargine. The LS mean change from baseline was -7.5 mmol/L (-135.0 mg/dL) for the FRC versus 
-4.3 mmol/L (-77.9 mg/dL) for insulin glargine with a LS mean treatment difference of -3.2 mmol/L 
(-57.1 mg/dL); p<0.0001.  
The FRC provided a significantly greater LS mean reduction from baseline in 2-hour PPG excursions 
versus insulin glargine. The LS mean reduction from baseline was 3.9 mmol/L (70.4 mg/dL) for the FRC 
and 0.7 mmol/L (12.0 mg/dL) for insulin glargine with a LS mean treatment difference of -3.2 mmol/L 
(-58.4 mg/dL); p<0.0001.  
A statistically significant difference was observed between treatment groups for mean change in body weight. At 
Week 24, the LS mean reduction in body weight was 0.97 kg for the FRC versus an increase of 0.48 kg for insulin 
glargine (LS mean treatment difference of -1.44 kg; p<0.0001).  
The average daily insulin glargine doses increased in both treatment groups over the treatment period. The LS 
mean daily average insulin glargine doses were comparable at Week 24: 36.1 U for the FRC group and 39.3 U 
for the insulin glargine group. There were comparable reductions in mean change from baseline to Week 24 in 
FPG between treatment groups with a LS mean change of -3.4 mmol/L (-60.3 mg/dL) for the FRC and -3.5 
mmol/L (-63.3 mg/dL) for insulin glargine.  
Significantly more patients treated with the FRC reached the composite endpoint of HbA1c <7.0% with no 
weight gain at Week 24 than patients treated with insulin glargine, 56.4% versus 37.3% (treatment difference: 
19.0%, 95% CI: 8.57% to 29.51%). Significantly more patients reached the triple composite endpoint of HbA1c 
<7.0% with no weight gain at Week 24 and no documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia (plasma glucose 
concentration ≤3.9 mmol/L [≤70 mg/dL]) compared to insulin glargine-treated patients, 46.3% versus 28.6% 
(treatment difference: 17.7%, 95% CI: 7.46% to 27.97%).

2.4.7.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The efficacy of the fixed-ratio combination in patients with T2DM was assessed in two pivotal phase 3 
active-controlled, 30-week, open-label studies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); study 
EFC12404 and study EFC12405.  
Study EFC12404 was designed to evaluate the contribution of the respective components insulin glargine and 
lixisenatide to the effect of the FRC. This study only included patients who were insulin naïve. Study EFC12405 
evaluated the FRC in patients on basal insulin therapy, with insulin glargine as the active comparator. All 
patients included had to be treated with basal insulin for at least 6 months. Thus this study was designed to 
support the use in of the FRC in patients switching from basal insulin. The objectives as well as the primary and 
secondary endpoints were adequate. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were adequate to ensure that a 
population representative for the target population was included in the studies. The development program is 
considered adequate in order to support an application for a fixed combination, although it should be noted that 
both studies were of relatively short duration (30 weeks).  
The open-label design used in both studies is accepted although a double-blind study is preferable, especially 
when the objective is non-inferiority (Study EFC12404). The randomisation was, in both studies stratified by 
value of HbA1c (<8%, ≥8%) during run-in and in study EFC12404 also second oral anti-diabetic drug (OAD) use 
at screening (yes, no) and in study EFC12405 metformin use at screening (yes, no). To be eligible for 
randomisation a patient had to have a value of HbA1c ≥7% and ≤10% at the end of the run-in period.  
The Applicant has developed two pens in order to accommodate both the expected dose range for insulin 
glargine as well as the dose range for lixisenatide, thus to avoid exceeding the maximum dose of 20 μg 
lixisenatide. When a patient switches from Pen A to Pen B, without changing the insulin dose, this will lead to a 
decrease in the lixisenatide dose by a maximum of 7 μg (at an insulin dose of 40 U). 
The Applicant has provided data supporting that the dose decrease in lixisenatide when patients transition from 
Pen A to Pen B does not have an adverse impact on glycaemic control.  
A human factors study has been conducted in order to investigate whether the dosing concept is understandable 
for the intended users; this issue is further discussed in the safety and RMP sections.  
The FRC was to be administered before breakfast in both studies. This is not entirely in line with the proposed 
SmPC, which states that the FRC may be given before any meal. In study EFC12404, the starting dose at 
randomisation was set according to the insulin glargine label (i.e. 10 U). With this starting dose, a lixisenatide 
dose of 5 μg will be administered, which is below the recommended starting dose for lixisenatide. However, data 
have been provided that show that an effect of lixisenatide is observed already at this dose (see section 
Pharmacodynamics). In study EFC12405, the patients entered the run-in with their previous insulin dose. This 
dose was then further titrated to achieve the target set for randomisation. The insulin glargine dose could be 
given at any time of the day. At randomisation, the starting dose was based on the lixisenatide component. 
Thus, depending on the patient’s insulin dose at randomisation, either Pen A or Pen B was to be used in order to 
administer 10 μg of lixisenatide while providing an insulin dose as close as possible to the insulin dose reached 
during titration.  
An adequate dose adjustment algorithm was in place, which was applied for both the FRC treated groups and 
those treated with insulin glargine in both studies. The maximum dose of FRC to be given was 60 U/20 μg. This 
dose was maintained also if rescue medication was introduced. In both studies the maximum allowed insulin 
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016 
Page 80/113 
  
  
glargine dose in the comparator arm was capped at 60 U. This is from a methodological point of view considered 
acceptable in study EFC12404 where the combination was to be compared to each of its components 
respectively. In study EFC12405 where the primary objective was to demonstrate superiority FRC vs. insulin 
glargine, the comparison may seem less fair since insulin glargine may then be used at a suboptimal dose. Study 
EFC12405 can therefore not provide any answer regarding whether the FRC is per se a better treatment option 
than insulin glargine alone in a setting where insulin glargine is used without any limitations, i.e. when basal 
insulin therapy is optimized, at least not with regard to reaching and keeping HbA1c targets. This is however less 
of an issue concerning known negative effects of insulin treatment (e.g. impact on body weight and the risk of 
hypoglycaemia).   
In study EFC12404, lixisenatide was given in accordance to label. The maintenance dose of 20 μg could be 
reduced if not tolerated.  
Relevant criteria for when to start rescue medication were in place. For the lixisenatide group, the choice of 
rescue treatment was left at the Investigator’s discretion, whereas for the FRC and insulin glargine treated 
groups, specific recommendations were given. This is acceptable considering that no other GLP-1 RA, DPP-4 
inhibitor or basal insulin should be used as rescue medication in any of the 3 treatment groups.  
In Study EFC12404 the non-inferiority margin was set to 0.3%, which is commonly accepted. For the superiority 
hypothesis a difference of 0.4% was assumed in both studies and hence, irrespective of comparison; FRC versus 
lixisenatide or FRC versus insulin glargine. With the non-inferiority margin 0.3% supposed to represent a 
non-clinically relevant difference, a difference >0.4% may have been more appropriate. With regard to study 
powering the assumption of a smaller difference as opposed to a bigger is however conservative.  
In both Phase 3 pivotal studies the statistical methodology was similar although differed with respect to 
non-inferiority/superiority testing of the primary efficacy endpoint and the order of hierarchical testing for the 
key secondary endpoints. The principal features of the statistical analyses planned are overall acceptable. 
Analyses of the primary endpoint were based on a mixed-effect model with repeated measures (MMRM) under 
the missing at random framework. It is endorsed that several sensitivity analyses were planned and have also 
been performed. There was no PP population defined in any of the studies; foremost potentially an issue in study 
EFC12404 considering the non-inferiority objective. Analyses were performed with or without censoring of 
HbA1c measurements obtained after IMP discontinuation or introduction of rescue therapy with the latter being 
the primary approach.  
In study EFC12404 a high percentage of randomised and treated patients completed the open-label study 
treatment period; 440/469 (93.8%) in the FRC arm, 440/467 (94.2%) in the insulin glargine arm and 205/233 
(87.6%) in the lixisenatide arm. The proportion of patients who required rescue therapy was low and, at least in 
the FRC and insulin glargine treatment group also very similar; 3.6% (17/468) and 3.4% (16/466) respectively. 
In the lixisenatide arm 12.4% (29/233) required rescue therapy.  
Also in study EFC12405 a high percentage of patients completed the open-label treatment period although 
slightly fewer in the FRC than in the insulin glargine arm; 91.6% (336/367) and 96.2% (355/369) respectively. 
The proportion of patients requiring rescue therapy was lower in the FRC arm than in the insulin glargine arm, 
2.7% (10/366) and 6.0% (22/365).  
The included population in the Phase 3 trials had a mean BMI of >30, indicating that they were obese. It is not 
clear whether this fixed ratio combination is also efficacious in a non-obese population (e.g. BMI<25). It is a fact 
that diabetic patients with low BMI are more likely to have beta cell destruction rather than insulin resistance as 
an underlying cause for their diabetes and therefore GLP-1 analogues are less suited to treat these patients.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study EFC12404  
Baseline data are considered representative for a T2DM population failing on OAD treatment and that would 
benefit from insulin initiation. Notably the mean BMI was high (31.7). Only 3 % of subjects were older than 75 
years. The mean metformin dose was 2250 mg, it is however noted that 8 subjects (0.7 %), evenly distributed 
between treatment groups, used a metformin dose <1500 mg daily. A comparable, low proportion of patients in 
the FRC and insulin glargine groups received rescue therapy (3.4% and 3.6%, respectively), whereas the 
proportion was higher in the lixisenatide group (12.4%). 
The primary objective of the study was met as superiority for the FRC vs lixisenatide was shown as well as both 
noninferiority and superiority for the FRC vs insulin glargine. The change in HbA1c from baseline was 1.63 % in 
the FRC treated group. Notably, the treatment difference in change in HbA1c between FRC and insulin glargine 
was only about 0.3 %, which is of borderline clinical relevance, whereas the treatment difference between FRC 
and lixisenatide was about 0.8 %. Thus it appears that insulin glargine contributes the major part of the FRC 
effect. These data are in line with the outcome for the fixed combination insulin degludec/liraglutide, where the 
treatment difference between insulin degludec/liraglutide and insulin degludec was -0.47% and -0.64% 
between insulin degludec/liraglutide and liraglutide in a trial of 26 weeks duration (baseline HbA1c 8.3%).  
Considering that few patients lacked data at Week 30 and also that all efficacy assessments were included, 
irrespective of requiring rescue therapy or treatment discontinuation, primary outcomes are considered 
statistically convincing. While the “all assessments approach”, which includes efficacy assessments when a 
patient was on rescue, may be conservative in the superiority setting it may not when the aim is non-inferiority. 
However, regarding the comparison versus insulin glargine, not only non-inferiority but also superiority was 
shown. While a PP population had been expected in study EFC12404 the lack thereof is acceptable; with 
data/information in hand a PP population is not considered to differ that much from the mITT population as to 
change the conclusion of non-inferiority, FRC vs. insulin glargine. All sensitivity analyses performed showed very 
similar outcomes compared to the primary analysis. Thus the data is considered robust. 
When the change in HbA1c was plotted over time, the curves separated already after 8 weeks. For the FRC and 
for lixisenatide, it appears as if the maximal effect has been reached at six months whereas the curve for insulin 
glargine showed a continuous decrease throughout the study.  
The effect of the three different treatments on PPG was studied during a standardized meal test. A greater 
change in mean 2-hour PPG excursions from baseline was observed for the FRC treated group (-2.31 mmol/L) 
compared to the insulin glargine treated group (-0.2 mmol/L). The treatment difference was statistically 
significant (-2.1 mmol/L, 95%CI, -2.5 to -1.8; p<0.0001).  The corresponding change in mean 2-hour PPG 
excursion for lixisenatide was -3.23 mmol/L.  Notably, the pre-meal PG was comparable and lower in the FRC 
and insulin glargine treated groups compared to the lixisenatide group. In the FRC and lixisenatide treated 
groups, the highest PPG was observed 1 hour after the meal, whereas PPG had not started to decline at 2 hours 
in the insulin glargine treated group.  
The FPG at baseline was comparable in the three treatment groups. At week 30, the effect on FPG was 
comparable in the FRC and insulin glargine treated groups, and mean values were well within the target range 
(6.32 mmol/L and 6.53 mmol/L, respectively). For lixisenatide the FPG at week 30 was 8.27 mmol/L. This is in 
line with the differences observed for the pre-meal PG recorded in the standardized meal test. The treatment 
difference in change in FPG from baseline between the FRC and the lixisenatide treated groups was statistically 
significant.  
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016 
Page 82/113 
  
  
There was a notable reduction in SMPG profiles with all three treatments compared to baseline. The average 
7-point SMPG was statistically significantly lower in the FRC treated group (-3.4 mmol/L) compared to both the 
lixisenatide (-2.0 mmol/L) and insulin glargine (-2.7 mmol/L) treated groups. Compared to insulin glargine, the 
FRC treated group showed lower pre- and post-prandial values at all time points except for the pre-breakfast 
(FPG) value. This appears to be mainly driven by a lower PPG excursion after breakfast with FRC. 
Thus the data on 2-hour PPG excursions, FPG and SMPG profiles are consistent and indicate that the insulin 
component mainly affects the FPG levels and the lixisenatide exerts its main effect on PPG levels. 
Body weight remained stable in the FRC treated group (-0.3 kg) whereas body weight increased in the insulin 
glargine group (1.1 kg) and decreased in the lixisenatide group (-2.3 kg). The treatment difference between FRC 
and insulin glargine of -1.4 kg was statistically significant (95% CI [-1.9 to -0.9]; p<0.0001).  
Although numerically higher in the FRC group, the proportion of patients reporting symptomatic hypoglycaemias 
were was rather low and comparable in the FRC (25.6 %) and insulin glargine (23.6 %) treated groups. As 
expected, the rate of hypoglycaemias was lowest in the lixisenatide group (6.4 %). 
The proportion of patients achieving both either the target of < 7% and or ≤6.5% was higher in the FRC treated 
group (74 % and 56 %) compared to both insulin glargine (59 % and 40 %) and lixisenatide (33 % and 19 %). 
A statistically significantly higher proportion of patients reached the target “HbA1c < 7 % with no body weight 
gain” in the FRC group (43.2%) compared to the insulin glargine group (25.1%). The proportion was also higher 
in the FRC group compared to the lixisenatide group (27.9%).  A higher proportion of patients in the FRC group 
(31.8%) reached the triple composite endpoint (HbA1c < 7%, no body weight gain and no documented 
symptomatic hypoglycaemias) compared to both the insulin glargine group (18.9%) and the lixisenatide group 
(26.2%). The treatment difference between FRC and insulin glargine was statistically significant.  
There were no difference in insulin doses between the FRC and insulin treated groups at week 30. The mean 
daily dose rose concordantly over the treatment period. The distribution of patients across different dose levels 
was comparable. A slightly higher proportion of patients in the insulin glargine group (20.1 %) used 60 U at 
week 30 compared to the FRC group (15.6 %). For a further understanding of efficacy among patients using the 
maximum dose allowed (60U) the Applicant was asked to perform additional subgroup analyses based on the 
subgroups >40U to <60U and =60U respectively. The data show that in the proportion of patients reaching the 
maximum FRC dose of 60 dose steps, about 50 % reached the target with this dose. Thus the proportion of 
patients that could potentially benefit from a different therapy was low at 30 weeks. 
It is noted that two patients in the insulin glargine treated group were using more than 60 U daily at the end of 
study.  
The data on insulin doses is somewhat in contrast to the data for insulin degludec/liraglutide, where the insulin 
dose was lower (38 U) in the insulin degludec/liraglutide arm compared to the insulin degludec arm (53 U) at 26 
weeks. It should be noted that the insulin degludec dose was not capped in that study.  
The mean lixisenatide dose in the FRC group was 15.5 μg at week 30. The mean lixisenatide dose in the 
monotherapy group was not calculated, but 89 % of patients were receiving the recommended maintenance 
dose of 20 μg. Notably, two patients are reported to have used > 20 μg in the FRC treated group. This was due 
to incorrect use of Pen A.  
Study EFC12405  
Baseline data are considered representative for a T2DM population on insulin treatment. Notably the mean BMI 
was high (31.3). Thirty-nine patients (5.3 %) were older than 75 years. The mean insulin dose at screening was 
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016 
Page 83/113 
  
  
29 U. The inclusion criteria stated that the insulin dose should be ≥20 U at randomisation. There were a total of 
7 patients with an insulin dose <20 U at randomisation (5 patients in the FRC group and 2 in the insulin glargine 
group). Although the patients were not evenly distributed between groups, this discrepancy from the inclusion 
criterion is not considered to have an effect on the outcome as the deviation from the target in most cases was 
small and the number of patients low.  
The study met its primary endpoint. The change in HbA1c from baseline in the FRC group was larger than the 
change in the insulin glargine group with a treatment difference of -0.52% (95% CI [-0.63% to -0.40%]; p< 
0.0001). Based on the limited amount of missing data and the proportion of patients who discontinued the 
treatment period and/or study treatment the difference shown between treatments in favour of FRC is 
considered statistically convincing. The percentage of patients with HbA1c value at Week 30 was slightly less in 
the FRC than in the insulin glargine treatment arm; 94.5% (346/366) compared to 97.3% (355/365) 
respectively. Of the patients randomised, there were more patients in the FRC arm than in the insulin glargine 
arm who did not complete the open-label treatment period, 29/367 (7.9%) and 10/369 (2.7%) respectively. 
There was also more patients in the FRC group than in the control group that discontinued study treatment; 
19/367 (5.2%) compared to 7/369 (1.9%). Despite these differences in treatment/study compliance pattern, 
they are numerically considered to be limited and as such not considered to be of any major concern regarding 
the primary conclusion.  
The outcome in the subgroup of patients on basal insulin alone at randomisation was comparable to that of the 
overall population. 
Again the data are in line with the outcome of a study of comparable design comparing insulin 
degludec/liraglutide with insulin degludec where the estimated treatment difference was -1.05 % (baseline 
HbA1c 8.7-8.8%). 
When the change in HbA1c is plotted over time, the curves have separated already after 8 weeks. The effect of 
insulin glargine appears to have reached a plateau already at 12 weeks whereas HbA1c showed further decrease 
up to 24 weeks in the FRC treated groups. It appears as if the maximal effect has been reached at six months 
for both treatments.  
One concern with the design of study EFC12405 was the capping of the insulin glargine dose at 60 U per day. 
However, at the end of the 30 week study period, the insulin dose did not differ between groups (mean dose 
about 47 U, 0.54 U/kg body weight). A slightly higher proportion of patients in the insulin glargine treated group 
(31%) was using the maximum dose allowed (60 U) than in the FRC treated group (27%). Taking the low 
proportion of patients needing rescue in both study arms (2.7% [10/366] for FRC and 6.0% [22/365] for insulin 
glargine), the capping of the insulin glargine dose appears not to have affected the outcome to a greater extent 
in this short-term study.  In post hoc analyses performed, HbA1c responders (<=6.5%/<7%) was evaluated 
also by final insulin dose category. The outcomes across dose category subgroups were fairly consistent within 
each treatment arm respectively with the biggest difference between treatments (FRC, insulin glargine) seen in 
the highest dose category (>40U to ≤60U) including 60.8% (222/365) of the patients in the FRC arm and 64.7% 
(236/365) of the patients in insulin glargine arm respectively. For a further understanding of efficacy among 
patients using the maximum dose allowed (60U) the Applicant was asked to perform additional analyses based 
on the subgroups >40U to <60U and =60U respectively. Within each treatment arm the subgroups of subjects 
who had reached a final insulin dose of 60 U had the numerically lowest response rates (HbA1c <7%) when 
compared with the subgroups with lower final insulin doses. Given that the same pattern was seen in both 
treatment arms, additional support is seemingly offered that the capping of the insulin glargine dose in the 
control arm in Study EFC12405 appears not to have affected the outcome to a greater extent in this short-term 
study. The data also show that in the subgroup of patients reaching the maximum FRC dose of 60 dose steps, 
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016 
Page 84/113 
  
  
43.4% (43/99) reached the target with this dose. Thus the proportion of patients that could potentially benefit 
from a different therapy was low at 30 weeks (approx. 15%; 56/365). 
A similar reduction from baseline in FPG was observed in the two treatment groups, with a mean FPG within 
target for both groups (6.78 mmol/L and 6.69 mmol/L, respectively). Thus the dose titration was similarly 
efficient for both treatments. In this study the decrease in FPG was less pronounced than in study EFC12404, 
probably due to the titration of insulin in the screening phase. It also appears as if the contribution of the 
lixisenatide component to the decrease in FPG was small as there was no “insulin saving” effect with the FRC, i.e. 
the mean insulin dose was similar in both groups at week 30.  
The mean daily dose of lixisenatide at 30 weeks was 16.9 μg. The majority of patients were using a dose ≥15 μg 
to ≤20 μg, thus very close to the recommended maintenance dose of lixisenatide when used as monotherapy.  
As in study EFC12404, the effect on PPG excursions was investigated after a standardized meal. A decrease of 
-3.9 mmol/L in the mean 2-hour PPG excursions was observed for the FRC treated group compared to -0.5 
mmol/L in the insulin glargine treated group. The treatment difference was statistically significant (-3.4 mmol/L, 
95%CI [-3.92 to -2.94]; p<0.0001). The mean 2-hour PPG excursions were 3.1 mmol/L for the FRC and 6.7 
mmol/L for insulin glargine. The pre-meal PG was comparable in the two treatment groups. While PPG was still 
increasing at two hours post-meal in the insulin glargine treated group, the PPG had reached a plateau at one 
hour post-meal in the FRC treated group. Thus these findings were consistent with those observed in study 
EFC12404. 
These data are in accordance with the data on the SMPG where the reduction in average 7-point SMPG was 
greater in the FRC treated group (-1.50 mmol/L) compared to patients treated with insulin glargine (-0.60 
mmol/L). The treatment difference between groups (-0.90 mmol/L) was statistically significant (p<0.0001). The 
FRC treated patients showed a less marked increase in post-breakfast PG which resulted in lower pre-lunch PG. 
The PPG excursions after lunch and dinner appear comparable between treatments, but due to the lower 
pre-lunch values in the FRC, all PG values remained lower than those observed in the insulin glargine treated 
group.  
Mean body weight decreased slightly in the FRC treated group (-0.67 kg) while it increased in the insulin treated 
group (0.70 kg). The treatment difference of -1.37 kg was statistically significant (95% CI [-1.808 to -0.930]; 
p<0.0001).  
The proportion of patients reporting symptomatic hypoglycaemias was comparable between the groups (40% 
with FRC and 43% with insulin glargine). Few episodes of severe symptomatic hypoglycaemia were reported (4 
patients in the FRC group and 1 in the insulin glargine group). 
In the responder analyses comparing the proportion of patients with HbA1c value ≤ 6.5% or <7% at Week 30 
respectively, there were statistically significant differences between FRC and insulin glargine in the favour of the 
FRC. Patients without assessments at week 30 were treated as non-responders. A statistically significant higher 
proportion of patients treated with the FRC reached the composite endpoint of” HbA1c <7% with no body weight 
gain” (34.2%) compared to the insulin glargine treated group (13.4%). The proportion of patients who achieved 
the triple composite endpoint “HbA1c <7% without body weight gain and no documented symptomatic 
hypoglycaemia” was also higher in the FRC treated group (20%) than in the insulin glargine treated group (9%).  
Special populations 
Although the number of patients is limited, there is no indication of a difference in benefit risk balance for the 
FRC when used in patients ≥75 years compared to younger patients. This is further supported by data from the 
lixisenatide file. The limited experience is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016 
Page 85/113 
  
  
No dedicated studies in special populations were performed. This is acceptable considering that both 
components have been well characterised with regards to renal and hepatic impairment.  
Sub group analysis 
A sub group analysis was performed on the pooled data from both studies. The effect of the FRC was comparable 
across all subgroups studies, except for subjects with GFR between 30 and 60. In this group a slightly lower 
decrease in HbA1c was observed, however the number of subjects was low. Notably, the difference in outcome 
in subjects with baseline HbA1c < 8% and >8% was small (-1.41% and -1.50%, respectively). The treatment 
difference compared to insulin glargine was also rather consistent across groups. It may be noted that the 
treatment difference increased slightly with age in favour of the FRC. The treatment difference was also slightly 
higher in females and in subjects with BMI <30 kg/m2. Additional subgroup analysis for patients with BMI ≤25, 
BMI >25 and ≤30 showed that efficacy in terms of HbA1c reduction was maintained across the range of BMI.  
Supportive data 
Study ACT12374 was a 24-week, phase 2 study which included 323 insulin naïve patients and compared the FRC 
(maximum dose 60 U/30 μg) to insulin glargine. The insulin glargine dose was not capped in this study. The 
study met its primary objective to show that the FRC was non-inferior to insulin glargine with regards to change 
in HbA1c from baseline. Further testing demonstrated that the FRC was superior to insulin glargine. No 
difference was observed in change from baseline in FPG and at the end of the study, and insulin doses were 
comparable between groups. The data from this study are in line with those presented with the pivotal studies. 
2.4.8.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The FRC has been investigated in a clinical programme of adequate design. The FRC is provided in two different 
pens with two different ratios between insulin glargine and lixisenatide which may increase the risk for 
medication errors. Study EFC12404 provides relevant information on the contribution of the mono-components 
to the effect of the FRC. Insulin glargine primarily reduces HbA1c by decreasing the fasting plasma glucose 
whereas lixisenatide primarily reduces the post-prandial glucose excursion. The major contribution in HbA1c is 
due to insulin glargine as the treatment difference between the FRC and insulin glargine ranged from 0.3 % to 
0.5 %, whereas the treatment difference between the FRC and lixisenatide was 0.8 %. With the FRC, the 
decrease in HbA1c was achieved without increase in body weight, and without an increase in the reporting of 
hypoglycaemia compared to patients on monotherapy with insulin glargine. There was no difference in insulin 
dose with the FRC compared to monotherapy with insulin glargine in any of the studies, thus there was no insulin 
“saving” effect with the FRC when the insulin dose in the comparator group was capped at 60 U. The effect was 
consistent across studies and across investigated subgroups. 
In the studies, the FRC was always to be taken before breakfast, whereas the proposed SmPC states that 
Suliqua can be taken prior to any meal. It is acknowledged that both insulin glargine and lixisenatide may be 
taken at any time of the day when used in mono-therapy. The recommendation has been further supported by 
data from the lixisenatide file, showing that no statistically significant differences are observed between 
pre-breakfast or pre-dinner dosing of lixisenatide. 
There is a lack of long-term data beyond 30 weeks with the FRC. However, further analyses have shown that 
only a small proportion of patients (7% and 15%, study EFC12404 and EFC12405 respectively) had both 
reached the maximum dose and were in need of intensified treatment at week 30. In addition, data from the 
lixisenatide file has been presented which shows maintenance of efficacy up to 76 weeks in combination with 
basal insulin. Thus it appears plausible that the effect can be maintained for a majority of patients at the doses

available. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The safety of FRC compared with insulin glargine alone and lixisenatide alone in T2DM  was mainly studied in one 
active-controlled, open-label,  24 weeks, Phase 2 study (ACT12374) and two active-controlled, open-label, 30 
weeks  Phase 3 studies (EFC12404 and EFC12405).  
Safety data was pooled in the following two datasets: 
• 
• 
Phase 3 controlled study pool (including study EFC12404 and EFC12405)  
Phase 2/3 controlled study pool (including study ACT12374, EFC12404 and EFC12405).  
Safety analyses of the FRC compared with lixisenatide alone were based on the results of Study EFC12404.  
Cumulative exposure of study treatment in the Phase 2/3 controlled study pool was 534 patients-years (N=995) 
for FRC and 542 patients-years (N=994) for insulin glargine, respectively. Total exposure to study medication by 
final lixisenatide dose at the end of the open-label treatment period in study EFC12404 was 124.6 patient-years 
(N=233) (Table 17). 
Table 17 Overall exposure to study medication in the Phase 2/3 studies – safety population 
The majority of patients exposed to FRC were in the age of <50-<65 years (72%) in the Phase2/3 study pool. 
A substantial amount of patients in the age above 65 years was exposed to the FRC (28%). However, the total 
exposure to FRC in very elderly (>75 years) was low (n=34). This is reflected in the SmPC.  
Patients below 18 years of age and patients with severe renal impairment were not included in the studies. This 
is reflected in the SmPC and uses in these populations are defined as “Missing information” in the RMP.

Adverse events 
Common adverse event 
In the Phase 3 Study pool, the percentage of patients experience at least one treatment emergent adverse event 
(TEAE) was comparable in the FRC and insulin glargine group (55% vs 50% ) but slightly lower in subjects on 
FRC compared to subjects on lixisenatide (57% vs 67%; study EFC12404).  Percentages and rates of TEAEs are 
presented in Table 18. 
There were no new or unexpected adverse events in any of the treatment groups. The main difference in TEAE 
pattern between the treatment groups was that subjects in the FRC group compared to subjects on insulin 
glargine more often experienced GI symptoms (nausea [10.0% versus 2.3%], diarrhoea [7.0% vs 3.6%], 
vomiting [3.4% versus 1.1%]). 
On the other hand, GI symptoms were less frequently reported among subjects on FRC compared to 
lixisenatide. Nausea was reported in 9.6% in patients on FRC vs 24.0% in patients on lixisenatide and vomiting 
was reported 3.2% vs 6.4% in these treatment groups, respectively.  
The overall most common (>5%) TEAE in subjects on FRC were nausea (10.0%), diarrhea (7.0%), 
nasopharyngitis (7.0%), upper respiratory tract infection (5.5%) and headache (5.4%). All these are, by the 
Applicant, proposed to be labelled in the SmPC section 4.8.  
Table 18 Overall summary of TEAEs in the phase 3 controlled studies safety population 
Gastrointestinal events 
The first event of nausea and vomiting was reported within approximately the first 9 weeks after the start of 
FRC. The majority of the patients that experienced nausea and vomiting had only 1 or 2 episodes of these 
events. Most (99%) of the events were of mild or moderate severity.  
Hypoglycaemia  
Due to the different populations, symptomatic hypoglycaemia was analysed separately for each Phase 3 study. 
Overall, there was no sign of increased risk in frequency of patients who experienced at least one event of 
documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia (defined as an event with typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia 
accompanied by a measured plasma glucose concentration of ≤ 3.9 mmol/L [70 mg/dL]) in the FRC groups 
compared to patients on insulin glargine. Among insulin naïve patients (study EFC12404) 25.6% on FRC and 
23.6% on insulin glargine respectively, experienced at least one event of documented symptomatic 
hypoglycaemia. The corresponding frequencies for patients insufficiently controlled on basal insulin with or 
without OAD were higher, 40.0% for patients on FRC and 42.5% for patients on insulin glargine.  
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016 
Page 88/113 
  
  
 
The rate of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemic event per patient-year was 1.44 in the FRC group 
compared to 1.22 in the insulin glargine group in study EFC12404 and 3.03 in the FRC group compared to 4.22 
in the insulin glargine group in study EFC12405. 
As expected the risk for symptomatic hypoglycaemia was significantly increased for subjects on FRC compared 
to subjects in the lixisenatide group (6.4%).  
No cases of severe hypoglycaemia were noted in the FRC subjects during the 30 week trial period in study 
EFC12404.  In study EFC12405, severe hypoglycaemia was reported in low frequency in both patients on FRC 
(1.1% ) and on insulin glargine (0.3%)..  
Cardiovascular Events  
There was no increased rate of CV events in subjects on FRC compared to subjects on the mono-components 
(insulin glargine and lixisenatide, respectively). The majority of CV events, both in the FRC and insulin glargine 
group, were events related to “coronary revascularization procedures”.  
Pancreatitis 
There were no events judged by the PSAC to be pancreatitis in any of the treatment groups. In accordance with 
the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004 from CHMP in October 2013, of GLP-1 based therapies and 
pancreatic safety the RMP includes pancreatitis as an important identified risk and the SmPC section 4.4 includes 
a warning regarding acute pancreatitis. 
Malignant or unspecified tumours  
Malignant or unspecified tumors were presented in 7 (0.7%) patients in the FRC group, 5 (0.5%) patients in the 
insulin glargine group, and 1 (0.4%) patient in the lixisenatide group. There were no clinically relevant 
differences across treatment groups in malignant or unspecified tumours. 
Medication errors 
The number of pen-related events (PRE) per 100 PYE was in general slightly higher for subjects on FRC 
compared to both subjects on insulin glargine and lixisenatide, respectively. A further and deeper analyse of PRE 
is presented in the document “Pen-related events and initiation dose deviations observed in clinical trials” 
attached in Annex 12.2 in the RMP. According to this document the major reason for the PREs was events of 
category 1 (“Use of pen outside its intended dose range or outside the dose range defined by the study 
protocol”). None of the PREs in any of the treatment groups were associated with a clinical event.  
“Medication errors including mix-ups between the different strength of the product” have been suggested as an 
important potential risk in the RMP. The risk includes “Mix-up with different product strengths including by 
visually impaired or colour blind patient mix-ups”. A warning regarding mix-ups between the 2 strength of 
Suliqua and other injectable diabetes medicinal product is reflected in the PIL and SmPC (see also section 3.5 
Risk management plan).  
Treatment-emergent adverse events by investigator causality  
In the Phase 3 study pool, the percentage of patients with at least 1 TEAE, judged by the Investigator to be 
related to IMP, was higher in the FRC compared with the insulin glargine group (14.6% versus 1.9%). In Study 
EFC12404, the percentage was lower in the FRC group compared with the lixisenatide group (14.9% versus 
32.2%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016 
Page 89/113 
  
  
 
The most frequently reported drug-related TEAEs with an incidence ≥3% in any treatment group (ie, FRC, insulin 
glargine and/or lixisenatide groups) were nausea (8.4%, 0.1%, and 22.3%, respectively), headache (0.6%, 
0.4%, and 4.3%, respectively), diarrhea (2.2%, 0.1%, and 3.0%, respectively), and vomiting (2.2%, 0%, and 
3.9%, respectively). All these adverse reactions have been listed in the SmPC section 4.8 of the FRC with a 
frequency based on reactions judged as related by the investigator which is accepted. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Serious adverse events occurred in 4.6% of subjects on FRC and with similar frequencies as the monotherapies 
(FRC vs insulin glargine: 4.6% vs 4.4% [Phase 3 study pool] and FRC vs lixisenatide [study EFC12404]: 3.8% 
vs 3.9%). Thus, there seemed not to be an increased risk of SAEs in subject on FRC compared to subjects on the 
respective monotherapies. No apparent PT clustering of serious events was noted. Most PTs were reported with 
low frequencies.  In the FRC group, no PT were reported in more than 2 cases. The most common SOC for SAEs 
was Cardiac disorders with 9 events (1.1%) in the FRC group and 8 events (1.0%) in the insulin glargine group. 
In total, 10 fatal events were reported in the Phase 3 studies and none in the Phase 2 study or in the 6 Phase 1 
studies. Three of the fatal events occurred in subjects on FRC, 6 in subjects on insulin glargine and one in a 
subject on lixisenatide.  The fatal events were distributed without any apparent clustering of PTs or difference in 
frequency between the treatment groups. 
Laboratory findings 
Serum Calcitonin, haematology parameters (haemoglobin, haematocrit, erythrocytes, platelets, white blood 
cells), lipid parameters (total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-C, and LDL-C), electrolytes, renal function tests 
(creatinine clearance, creatinine, uric acid and albumin) and liver function tests (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, and total 
bilirubin) were tested at baseline and through the on-treatment period without any relevant change from  or 
difference between treatment groups. 
Pancreatic enzymes (Lipase and amylase) 
Overall, concentrations of both lipase and amylase slightly increase with FRC over 30 weeks of treatment.   
Lipase levels increased more with FRC compared to use with insulin glargine but less compared to use with 
lixisenatide. 
Amylase increased similar between the three treatment groups.  
The percentage of patients in the FRC group with elevations in lipase or amylase considered as Potential 
Clinically Significant Abnormal (≥3 x ULN regardless of baseline status) were low, 7/828 (0.8%) for lipase and 
4/468 (0.9%) for amylase. Almost equally low percentages of elevations considered as PCSA were seen for 
insulin glargine and lixisenatide. 
Vital signs 
Overall, there was no change of in SBP or DBP from baseline and through the on treatment period in any of the 
studied treatment groups. 
Heart rate 
Overall, heart rate increased slightly in all groups, most in the subjects on lixisenatide. The change from baseline 
after 30 weeks on treatment was 0.9±8.9 bpm in the FRC group, 0.7±8.6 bpm in the insulin glargine group and 
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016 
Page 90/113 
  
  
1.8±8.9 bpm in the lixisenatide group. The number of PCSA heart rate cases was equally low in all treatment 
groups (one in each). 
Previous studies have indicated that liraglutide (and other GLP 1RA) increases the heart rate and this is reflected 
in the SmPC section 4.8 for lixisenatide as monotherapy. Even if the present studies did not show any increased 
heart rate with the FRC, the known phenomenon with increased heart rate for lixisenatide (and other GLP 1RA) 
as monotherapy, is reflected in the SmPC even for the FRC.  
Safety in special populations 
No difference of clinical importance regarding incidence of TEAEs was noted between the subgroups of gender, 
BMI and race.  
Age  
Overall, the total percentages of TEAEs did not differ between the different age-groups (<65 versus ≥65 years 
and <75 versus ≥75 years, respectively). However, in the small group of very elderly (>75 years; n=34) the risk 
of nausea and diarrhoea were increased compared to the subjects below 75 years (nausea: 9.4% vs 24.2% and 
diarrhoea 6.7% vs 12.1% respectively among patients <75 versus ≥75 years). Serious TEAEs were also more 
frequent in the age-group >75 years (27%) compared to the younger age groups < 50 years (3%), > 50 to < 
65 years (3%) and > 65 to <75 (6%). However, the events in the very elderly populations were not considered 
as related to IMP and no fatal events occurred in this age group. 
Use of lixisenatide as monotherapy has been studied in a larger population of the very elderly in study EFC12703 
(GetGoal-O; EMEA/H/C/002445/II/0014) and in the ELIXA study (EMEA/H/C/002445/II/0013). Results from 
these studies indicated that the risks associated with lixisenatide treatment in the geriatric population (including 
patients >75 years) were not considerably increased compared with the risk associated with this treatment in 
the overall diabetic population. The benefit risk was thus considered to be positive also in this population.  
Renal function  
TEAE incidence in the FRC treatment group were similar in patients with normal renal function (53.8%) 
compared to mild renal function (56.5%). Patients on FRC with moderate decrease in GFR had higher 
percentage of TEAEs (76.5%) compared to those with normal GFR and mild decreased GFR.  However, this 
patient group was small (n=37/995 on FRC in the Phase 2/3 controlled study pool) which makes a meaningful 
conclusion on clinical relevance difficult. 
Use of lixisenatide as monotherapy in the population with moderately increased renal function was also, as age, 
studied in study EFC12703 (GetGoal-O; EMEA/H/C/002445/II/0014) and in the ELIXA study 
(EMEA/H/C/002445/II/0013). Data from these studies indicated that the risks associated with lixisenatide 
treatment in the population with moderately increased renal function were not considerably increased compared 
with the risk associated with this treatment in the overall diabetic population. The benefit risk was thus 
considered to be positive also in this population.  
No patients with severe renal impairment were included in the studies. This is reflected in the SmPC section 4.2 
and 4.4 and “Use in patients with severe renal function” are included in the RMP as “Missing information”.  
Immunological events 
Allergic reactions: Events adjudicated by ARAC as allergic reactions were reported in similar low frequencies 
between subjects on FRC (0.7%) compared to subjects in the insulin glargine (0.5%) and lixisenatide group

(0.9%). Three events in patients on FRC were judged as allergic reactions possible related to the treatment. All 
these events were events of urticaria. The Applicant has proposed urticaria to be included in the SmPC section 
4.8 (uncommon) (Table 19). 
Table 19 Number (%) of patients with TEAEs adjudicated as allergic reaction by ARAC in the Phase 
2/3 controlled studies – safety population. 
Injection site reactions: The frequency of subjects reporting injection site reactions were similar with the FRC 
compared to formulations with insulin glargine (1.7% [17/995] vs 1.1% [11/994]) and FRC compared to 
lixisenatide, respectively (2.6% [127469] vs 3.0% [7/233]). The events were mild in all treatment groups, 
except for one event in the FRC and one in the insulin glargine group with moderate severity (Table 20). 
Mostly single episodes of injection site reactions were reported (15/17 in the FRC group). 
Table 20 Number (%) of patients with TEAEs related to injection site reactions in the Phase 2/3 
controlled studies – safety population. 
Antibody status and concentration over time  
Anti-lixisenatide antibodies (ADA) status and concentrations were studied in study EFC12404 and study 
EFC12405. Development of ADA (e.g. conversion from ADA negative to ADA positive) occurred in 36% of the 
subjects on FRC over 30 weeks of treatment. A higher converting rate, 48%, was noted for the subjects using 
lixisenatide. 
In study EFC11321 a placebo-controlled, study to compare lixisenatide treatment (as mono-component) with 
placebo in T2DM patients not adequately controlled by a stable dose of metformin with or without sulfonylurea 
(EMEA/H/C/2445/MEA/002), the mean reduction in HbA1c was smaller in the group with the highest antibody 
concentrations. In the present Phase 3 program  most of the subjects, 79%,  both on FRC and lixisenatide 
respectively, had after 30 weeks treatment, ADA concentrations below the lower limit of quantification 
(LLOQ<3.21nmol/L). The remaining 21%, had concentrations of ADA above LLOQ.  
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016 
Page 92/113 
  
  
 
 
 
Anti-insulin antibodies (AIA): In the population without prior treatment to insulin (study 12404), the rate of 
conversion from AIA negative status at baseline to positive status at Week 30, was higher in the FRC group 
compared with the insulin glargine group: 18.9% versus 8.9%. In patient earlier treated with basal insulin 
(study 12405) the increase was lower and more similar between the treatment groups (15% in the FRC group 
vs 12% in the insulin glargine group) (Table 21). 
In accordance in patients without prior insulin treatment (study 12404) the AIA titers were higher among patient 
on FRC compared to these on only insulin glargine (Table 22). 
The Applicant has in addition to AIA data or study 12404 presented and discussed comparable side-by side data 
between treatment with insulin glargine (Lantus) respectively FRC from the FRC Phase 2 study (ACT12374), in 
insulin naïve patients. Also data from the Phase 3 studies of lixisenatide (study EFC10781) with 
lixisenatide+insulin glargine vs insulin glargine (Lantus) has been submitted. These data shows a slight higher 
incidence of AIA positive subjects in the FRC (43%) or insulin glargine + lixisenatide patients (17%) compared 
to patients only treated with insulin glargine (33% and 12% respectively) after 24 weeks treatment. The median 
AIA titres were in general low (varying from 2-8 in both studies). No clinically relevance regarding safety of 
subjects with AIA positivity in general has been identified.     
Immunogenicity/neutralisation is defined as an important potential risk in the RMP for SULIQUA and general 
warning regarding antibody formation against insulin glargine and/or lixisenatide is proposed in SmPC section 
4.4 of SULIQUA.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No additional or special studies have been conducted with the insulin glargine/lixisenatide combination to 
evaluate the effects on other drugs. Data relays on the lixisenatide monotherapy program.  
In the insulin glargine/lixisenatide FRC phase 3 studies, no patients were allowed to use SU, thus there is no 
experience of concomitant use with the FRC with SU. In general, concomitant use of SU with antidiabetic 
products, including GLP-1 RA and insulin, is associated with an increased risk for hypoglycaemia and the SmPC 
for lixisenatide already recommends against the use of the triple combination of SU, lixisenatide and insulin. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The frequency of patients with permanent discontinuation of study treatment due to TEAEs was higher in the 
FRC group (2.6%; both in the Phase 3 study pool and in study 12404) compared to monotherapy with insulin 
glargine (1.4%) but lower compared to monotherapy with the lixisenatide (9.0%). The difference between 
treatment groups was largely due to different frequencies of AEs in the SOC gastrointestinal disorders (nausea 
0.7%, vomiting 0.2%, diarrhoea 0.1% for the FRC vs none for insulin glargine) but included also events of 
urticarial (0.4% vs 0, for the FRC and insulin glargine respectively). 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The percentage of patients experience at least one TEAE was comparable in the FRC and insulin glargine group 
(55% vs 50% in the Phase 3 Study pool) but slightly lower in subjects on FRC compared to subjects on 
lixisenatide (57% vs 67% in study EFC12404).  
Overall, there were no unexpected adverse events in any of the treatment groups detected compared to the 
known adverse reactions with the mono-components. 
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016 
Page 94/113 
  
  
 
The overall most common adverse reactions with FRC, with a frequency above 5 % and irrespective of 
investigator causality assessment were, apart from hypoglycaemia (see further below), nausea (10.0%), 
diarrhoea (7.0%), nasopharyngitis (7.0%), upper respiratory tract infection (5.5%) and headache (5.4%).  
The most common treatment emergent adverse reactions reported as related to study drug (FRC) by the 
investigator were nausea (8.4%), diarrhoea (2.2%), vomiting (2.2%) and dizziness (1.4%). These four 
reactions are all labelled in the SmPC section 4.8 as “common” based on these frequencies.  
The main difference in TEAE pattern between the treatment groups was that subjects in the FRC group 
compared to subjects on insulin glargine more often experienced GI symptoms (incidence of nausea [10.0% 
versus 2.3%], diarrhoea [7.0% vs 3.6%], vomiting [3.4% versus 1.1%]) but patients on FRC less often 
experienced these reactions compared to subjects on lixisenatide (nausea:9.6% vs 24.0%; vomiting: 3.2% vs 
6.4% and headache: 5.1% vs 7.7%, respectively).  
Serious adverse events occurred in 4.6% of subjects on FRC and with similar frequencies as the monotherapies 
(FRC vs insulin glargine, 4.6% vs 4.4% and FRC vs lixisenatide, 3.8% vs 3.9%). Most of the PTs of the SAEs 
were reported with low frequencies without any clustering.   
Hypoglycaemia 
There were similar percentages of patients experience at least one documented hypoglycaemic episode among 
insulin naïve patients (study EFC12404) in the FRC and insulin glargine group (25.6% and 23.6%, respectively). 
The corresponding percentage compared to subjects on lixisenatide was lower (6.4%). Most of the subjects, 
both on FRC and insulin glargine, experienced 1-3 episodes documented hypoglycaemic per patient.  
For patients earlier treated with basal-insulin (study EFC124045) the percentages of at least one documented 
hypoglycaemic episode were higher in both treatment groups (40.0% [FRC] and 42.5% [insulin glargine]). Most 
probably this reflects that patients within study EF 12405 were more advanced in the diseases compared to the 
population in study EFC 12404. 
Severe hypoglycaemia was reported in low frequency in both patients on FRC (1.1% [study 12405]) and in the 
insulin glargine group (0.3%). 
It is known that concomitant use of SU with antidiabetic products, including insulin and GLP-1 RA, is associated 
with an increased risk for hypoglycaemia. However, in the present studies concomitant use with SU was not 
allowed. The SmPC for lixisenatide includes warnings against the use of the triple combination of SU, lixisenatide 
and insulin. 
Medication errors 
The FRC is provided in two different pens with two different ratios between insulin glargine and lixisenatide 
which may increase the risk for medication errors.  
“Medication errors including mix-ups between the different strength of the product” have been suggested as an 
important potential risk in the RMP. The risk includes “Mix-up with different product strengths including by 
visually impaired or colour blind patients mix-ups”. A warning regarding mix-ups between the 2 strength of 
Suliqua and other injectable diabetes medicinal product is reflected in the PIL and SmPC (see also section 5.1 
Risk management plan – safety specification). 
In order to high-light that Suliqua consists of two active substances and to avoid confusion, the term “dose 
steps” is used instead of “units”. This is in line with the terminology used for the already approved product 
Xultophy.

EMA/800280/2016 
Page 95/113 
  
  
Heart rate 
A minor increase in heart rate was noted in all treatment groups (changes from baseline after 30 weeks were 
0.9±8.9 bpm in the FRC group, 0.7±8.6 bpm in the insulin glargine group and 1.8±8.9 bpm in the lixisenatide 
group). The number of PCSA heart rate cases was equally low in all treatment groups (one in each).   
Even if the present studies did not show any increased heart rate with the FRC, the known phenomenon with 
increased heart rate for lixisenatide (and other GLP 1RA) as monotherapy, is reflected in the SmPC section 4.8 
of FRC.  
Allergic reactions  
Adjudicated allergic reactions by ARAC were reported in similar low frequencies between subjects on FRC 
compared to subjects in the insulin glargine (0.7% vs 0.5%) and lixisenatide (1.3% vs 0.9%). The PT:s of event 
judged as related to IMP (FRC) were all urticaria. Urticaria is labelled in the SmPC section 4.8.  Hypersensitivity 
is defined as an important identified risk in the RMP based on information of insulin glargine and lixisenatide as 
mono-components.  
Injection site reactions  
The frequency of subjects reporting injection site reactions were similar with FRC compared to formulations with 
insulin glargine (1.7% vs 1.1%) and lixisenatide (2.6% vs 3.0%) as mono-components. Most of the events were 
mild in all treatment groups and mostly 1 episode was reported per subjects.  
 Anti-lixisenatide antibodies (ADA) and anti-insulin antibodies (AIA) 
Development of ADA occurred in 36% of the subjects on FRC over 30 weeks of treatment compared to 48% in 
subjects on lixisenatide (EFC12404). However, most of the ADA positive subjects (79%) had low titres, below 
the lower limit of quantification. 
 After 30 weeks treatment, the insulin naïve population on FRC (study EFC12404) more often developed AIA 
(19%) compared to subjects on only insulin glargine (9%). In the non-insulin naïve patients (study EFC12405) 
the increase was lower and more similar between the treatment groups (15% in the FRC group vs 12% in the 
insulin glargine group).  
It was also noted a slight increase in frequency of AIA in insulin naïve patients treated with FRC (43%) in the 
Phase 2 study (ACT12374) and with glargine + lixisenatide (17%) in the lixisenatide phase 3 study (EFC10781), 
compared to 33% (study ACT12374) and 12% (study EFC10781) in patients only treated with insulin glargine 
after 24 weeks of treatment.  
The median AIA titres were, in generally comparable low in all studies with FRC, insulin glargine + lixisenatide 
and insulin glargine alone. No clinically relevance regarding safety of subjects with AIA positivity has in general 
been identified.  
A general warning regarding antibody formation against insulin glargine and/or lixisenatide is also proposed, by 
the Applicant, in SmPC section 4.4. Immunogenicity/neutralization is, by the Applicant, suggested as an 
important potential risk in the RMP.  
Use in special populations 
Age: Overall, the total percentages of TEAEs did not differ between the different age-groups. However, in the 
small group of very elderly (>75 years; n=34) the risk of nausea and diarrhoea were increased compared to the 
subjects below 75 years (nausea: 9.4% vs 24.2% in patients <75years vs >75 years respectively and diarrhoea 
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016 
Page 96/113 
  
  
6.7% vs 12.1% in these age groups). The incidence of serious TEAEs in the age >75 years were higher (27%) 
compared younger age groups (3-6%). Most of the serious TEAEs in the elderly population were judged as not 
related to the studied drug and no fatal events were presented in this age group. 
Use of lixisenatide as monotherapy has earlier been studied in a larger population of the very elderly (in study 
EFC12703 and in the ELIXA study (EMEA/H/C/002445/II/0013). Results from these studies indicated that the 
risks associated with lixisenatide treatment in the geriatric population (including patients >75 years) were not 
considerably increased compared with the risk associated with this treatment in the overall diabetic population. 
The benefit risk was thus considered to be positive also in this population.  
A limited use of the insulin glargine/lixisenatide FRC in patients above 75 years is reflected in the SmPC. 
Renal impairment: Patients on FRC with moderate decrease in GFR had higher percentage of TEAEs (76.5%) 
compared to those with normal GFR (53.8%) and mild decreased GFR (56.5%).  However, the population of 
patients with moderate renal impairment was small (n=37) in the present studies. 
Use of lixisenatide as monotherapy in the population with moderately increased renal function was also studied 
in study EFC12703 and in the ELIXA study. Data from these studies indicated that the risks associated with 
lixisenatide treatment in the population with moderately increased renal function were not considerably 
increased compared with the risk associated with this treatment in the overall diabetic population. The benefit 
risk was thus considered to be positive also in this population.  
No patients with severe renal impairment were included in the studies. This is reflected in the SmPC section 4.2 
and 4.4 and “Use in patients with severe renal function” are included in the RMP as “Missing information”. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
No new or unexpected adverse reactions were noted with the fixed combination of lixisenatide/insulin glargine 
(FRC) compared to the mono-components. The adverse reaction patterns differed however in the aspect that 
the FRC group had a lower frequency of subjects with gastrointestinal adverse reactions compared to the 
lixisenatide group but a higher frequency of subjects with these reactions compared to use with insulin glargine. 
The incidences of documented hypoglycaemic episode were comparable between the FRC and insulin glargine 
group. However, it should be noted that concomitant use of SU was not allowed in the present studies with FRC. 
Immunological reactions such as allergic reactions and injections site reactions were few and equally distributed 
between the different treatment groups. A lower frequency of patients developed lixisenatide antibodies (ADA) 
in the FRC group (36%) compared to the lixisenatide group (48%). However, development of insulin antibodies 
(AIA) after 30 weeks of treatment in insulin naïve patients was higher in subjects on FRC (19%) compared to 
subjects using insulin glargine as monotherapy (9%) in study 12404. This difference was not seen in the 
population with earlier exposure to insulin (study 12505; 15% AIA positives in the FRC group vs 12%in the 
insulin glargine group after 30 weeks treatment). The titres of AIA were however in general low in all treatment 
groups and no safety issues have been noted among the AIA positive subjects.  
Overall, the fixed combination of lixisenatide/insulin glargine demonstrates a comparable safety profile as the 
two mono-components. 
The RMP adequately reflects the safety concerns listed for the two monocomponents. The only risk specifically 
related to the FRC is “Medication errors including mix-ups between the different strength of the product”, which 
is included in the RMP as an important potential risk.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits  
Beneficial effects 
The insulin glargine/lixisenatide combination Suliqua is a fixed ratio combination (FRC) product of a long-acting 
human insulin analogue (insulin glargine) together with a glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist 
(lixisenatide). The Applicant has developed two pens in order to accommodate both the expected dose range for 
insulin glargine as well as the dose range for lixisenatide, thus to avoid exceeding the maximum dose of 20 μg 
lixisenatide. When a patient switches from Pen A to Pen B, without changing the insulin dose, this will lead to a 
decrease in the lixisenatide dose by a maximum of 7 μg (at an insulin dose of 40 U). The maximum dose is 60 
U/20 μg and the dose is to be individually titrated based on the insulin need. 
The efficacy of the fixed-ratio combination in patients with T2DM was assessed in two pivotal phase 3 
active-controlled, 30-week, open-label studies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); study 
EFC12404 and study EFC12405. The studies included in total 1906 patients. Both studies were in general 
adequately designed and largely in line with the current EMA guideline on fixed combinations 
(CHMP/EWP/240/95 Rev. 1). There are no concerns with regards to the general conduct of the studies. 
Study EFC12404 was designed to evaluate the contribution of the respective components insulin glargine and 
lixisenatide to the effect of the FRC. This study only included patients who were insulin naïve. Study EFC12405 
evaluated the FRC in patients on previous basal insulin therapy, with insulin glargine as the active comparator. 
Thus this study was designed to support the use of the FRC in patients switching from a therapy which included 
basal insulin. In both studies, the only concomitant oral anti-diabetic treatment allowed was metformin. 
Baseline data show that the subjects included can be considered representative for a T2DM population failing on 
OAD treatment and that would benefit from insulin initiation in study EFC12404. Baseline data from study 
EFC12405 show that subjects that can be considered representative for a T2DM population on basal insulin 
treatment were included.  
Both studies met their primary objective. In study EFC12404, superiority of the FRC over lixisenatide was 
shown as well as over insulin glargine. The change in HbA1c from baseline was -1.63 % in the FRC treated 
group. The treatment difference in change in HbA1c between FRC and insulin glargine was -0.29% (95% CI 
[-0.38% to -0.19%]; p< 0.0001), whereas the treatment difference between FRC and lixisenatide was -0.78% 
(95% CI [-0.90% to -0.67%]; p< 0.0001). The primary outcomes are considered statistically convincing. In 
study EFC12405, the change in HbA1c from baseline in the FRC group was -1.13% and -0.62% the insulin 
glargine group, with a treatment difference of -0.52% (95% CI [-0.63% to -0.40%]; p< 0.0001). It appears as 
if the maximal effect has been reached at six months for both treatments. 
In both studies the insulin dose was capped at 60 U per day in the comparator arm. This is adequate in study 
EFC12404, where the main objective was to study the contribution of each component to the effect of the FRC. 
There were no difference in insulin doses between the FRC and insulin treated groups at week 30. The mean 
daily dose rose concordantly over the treatment period. The distribution of patients across different dose levels 
was comparable. A slightly higher proportion of patients in the insulin glargine group (20.1 %) used 60 U at 
week 30 compared to the FRC group (15.6 %). 
However, in study EFC12405, the capping of the insulin glargine dose at 60 U per day is of some concern as the 
main objective was to compare the FRC with basal insulin treatment. Thus capping the insulin dose in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016 
Page 103/113 
  
  
comparator arm may not allow optimising the insulin treatment. However, at the end of the 30 week study 
period, the insulin dose did not differ between groups (mean dose about 47 U, 0.54 U/kg body weight, in both 
groups). A slightly higher proportion of patients in the insulin glargine treated group (31%) was using the 
maximum dose allowed (60 U) than in the FRC treated group (27%). Taking the low proportion of patients 
needing rescue in both study arms (2.7% [10/366] for FRC and 6.0% [22/365] for insulin glargine), the capping 
of the insulin glargine dose appears not to have affected the outcome to a greater extent in this short-term study 
and the lower need for rescue may be seen as additional support for FRC superiority in this setting. However, no 
conclusions can be drawn for the FRC in comparison to insulin glargine when insulin glargine is used without 
limitations.  
In both studies, the majority of patients were using a lixisenatide dose of ≥15 µg to ≤20 µg, thus very close to 
the recommended maintenance dose of lixisenatide when used as monotherapy. In study EFC12404, the mean 
lixisenatide dose in the monotherapy group was not calculated, but 89 % of patients were receiving the 
recommended maintenance dose of 20 μg. 
FPG was comparable across treatment groups at baseline in both studies. In study EFC12404, at week 30, the 
effect on FPG was comparable in the FRC and insulin glargine treated groups, and mean values were well within 
the target range (6.32 mmol/L and 6.53 mmol/L, respectively). For lixisenatide the FPG at week 30 was 8.27 
mmol/L (estimated treatment difference vs FRC -1.96 mmol/L, 95%CI [-2.25 to -1.68]; p<0.0001). In study 
EFC12405, the decrease in FPG was less pronounced than in study EFC12404, probably due to the titration of 
insulin in the screening phase, with a mean FPG at week 30 within target for both groups (6.78 mmol/L and 6.69 
mmol/L, respectively).  
In both studies, the effect on PPG excursions was studied during a standardized meal test. In study EFC12404, 
a greater change in mean 2-hour PPG excursions from baseline was observed for the FRC treated group (-2.31 
mmol/L) compared to the insulin glargine treated group (-0.2 mmol/L). The treatment difference was 
statistically significant (-2.1 mmol/L, 95%CI, -2.5 to -1.8; p<0.0001).  The corresponding change in mean 
2-hour PPG excursion for lixisenatide was -3.23 mmol/L. In line with the FPG data, the pre-meal PG was 
comparable and lower in the FRC and insulin glargine treated groups compared to the lixisenatide group. In 
study EFC12405, a decrease of -3.9 mmol/L in the mean 2-hour PPG excursions was observed for the FRC 
treated group compared to -0.5 mmol/L in the insulin glargine treated group. The treatment difference was 
statistically significant (-3.4 mmol/L, 95%CI [-3.92 to -2.94]; p<0.0001). In both studies, the highest PPG was 
observed 1 hour after the meal with FRC and lixisenatide, whereas PPG had not started to decline at 2 hours in 
the insulin glargine treated groups.  
Across both studies, there was a notable reduction in SMPG profiles with all three treatments compared to 
baseline. The decrease in the average 7-point SMPG was larger in the FRC treated group compared to both the 
lixisenatide and insulin glargine treated groups and the treatment differences were statistically significant. 
Compared to insulin glargine, the FRC treated group showed lower pre- and post-prandial values at all time 
points except for the pre-breakfast (FPG) value. This appears to be mainly driven by a lower PPG excursion after 
breakfast with FRC. The PPG excursions after lunch and dinner appear comparable between treatments, but due 
to the lower pre-lunch values in the FRC, all PG values remained lower than those observed in the insulin 
glargine treated group.  
Thus the data on 2-hour PPG excursions, FPG and SMPG profiles are consistent and indicate that the insulin 
component mainly affects the FPG levels and the lixisenatide exerts its main effect on PPG levels. 
In both studies, body weight remained stable or decreased slightly in the FRC treated group (-0.3 kg (study 
EFC12404); -0.67 kg (study EFC12405)) whereas body weight increased in the insulin glargine group (1.1 kg 
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016 
Page 104/113 
  
  
(study EFC12404); 0.70 kg (study EFC12405)) and decreased in the lixisenatide group (-2.3 kg (study 
EFC12404)). The treatment difference between FRC and insulin glargine was statistically significant in both 
studies.  
In study EFC12404, which included insulin-naïve subjects, the proportion of patients reporting symptomatic 
hypoglycaemias was rather low and comparable in the FRC (25.6 %) and insulin glargine (23.6 %) treated 
groups. As expected, the rate of hypoglycaemias was lowest in the lixisenatide group (6.4 %). In study 
EFC12405, which included subjects already on basal insulin, the proportion of patients reporting symptomatic 
hypoglycaemias was higher than in study EFC12404 but still comparable between the groups (40% with FRC 
and 43% with insulin glargine). Few episodes of severe symptomatic hypoglycaemia were reported (4 patients 
in the FRC group and 1 in the insulin glargine group).  
The responder analyses support the findings. In study EFC12404, the proportion of patients achieving both the 
target of < 7% and ≤ 6.5% was higher in the FRC treated group (74 % and 56 %, respectively) compared to 
both insulin glargine (59 % and 40 %, respectively) and lixisenatide (33 % and 19 %, respectively). A 
statistically significantly higher proportion of patients reached the target “HbA1c < 7 % with no body weight 
gain” in the FRC group (43.2%) compared to the insulin glargine group (25.1%). The proportion was also higher 
in the FRC group compared to the lixisenatide group (27.9%).  A higher proportion of patients in the FRC group 
(31.8%) reached the triple composite endpoint “HbA1c < 7%, no body weight gain and no documented 
symptomatic hypoglycaemias” compared to both the insulin glargine group (18.9%) and the lixisenatide group 
(26.2%). The treatment difference between FRC and insulin glargine was statistically significant. In study 
EFC12405, the proportion of patients with HbA1c value <7% or ≤ 6.5% at Week 30 respectively, were higher 
in the FRC treated group (55% and 34%, respectively) compared to the  insulin glargine treated group (30% and 
14%, respectively). A statistically significant higher proportion of patients treated with the FRC reached the 
composite endpoint of “HbA1c <7% with no body weight gain” (34.2%) compared to the insulin glargine treated 
group (13.4%). The proportion of patients who achieved the triple composite endpoint “HbA1c <7% without 
body weight gain and no documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia” was also higher in the FRC treated group 
(20%) than in the insulin glargine treated group (9%). 
The efficacy data in the subgroup of patients switching from monotherapy with basal insulin to the FRC in study 
EFC12405 (41 patients in the FRC group), was consistent with the data obtained in the overall population. The 
mean change in HbA1c was -1.27% in the FRC-treated group And the responder rate (HbA1c <7%) was 56.1%.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The FRC has only been studied in patients on a background metformin treatment as all other OADs were 
discontinued at screening. Further to this, the only external support for the triple combination with other OADs 
comes from the lixisenatide file where the triple combination SU/lixisenatide/insulin glargine was studied. 
However, due to the increased risk of hypoglycaemia, the SmPC for lixisenatide strongly recommends against 
this combination for safety reasons, please see further below. Information on both the not studied and studied 
OAD combinations is adequately reflected in sections 4.4 and 5.1 in the SmPC. However, due to the limitations 
in the available data, the indication has been restricted to the combination with metformin. 
The data in patients switching from basal insulin alone is very limited. Although the outcome in this subgroup is 
comparable to that in the overall population, the data is not considered sufficient to support specific mentioning 
of this population in the indication especially when taking into account that this treatment regimen is not in 
accordance with standard of care. 
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016 
Page 105/113 
  
  
There is a lack of long-term data beyond 30 weeks but further subgroup analyses of the patients reaching the 
maximum dose as well as data from the lixisenatide file have been provided. These data indicate that the effect 
can be maintained long-term for a majority of patients at the doses available. 
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
In the Phase 3 study pool there were no new or unexpected adverse events in any of the treatment groups. The 
most common treatment emergent adverse events reported as related to study drug (FRC) by the investigator 
were nausea (8.4%), diarrhoea (2.2%), vomiting (2.2%) and dizziness (1.4%). These four reactions are all 
labelled in the SmPC section 4.8 as “common”. 
The main difference in TEAE pattern between the treatment groups was that subjects on FRC compared to 
subjects on lixisenatide less often experienced gastrointestinal events (study EFC12404: nausea: 9.6% [FRC] vs 
24.0% [lixisenatide] and vomiting 3.2%[FRC] vs 6.4% [lixisenatide]). The frequency of subjects experience 
diarrhoea was the same between subjects on FRC and lixisenatide (9%). On the other hand,  subjects on FRC 
more often compared to subjects on insulin glargine experienced GI symptoms (nausea: 10.0% vs 2.3%; 
diarrhoea: 7.0% vs 3.6% and vomiting: 3.4% versus 1.1% for the FRC and insulin glargine groups, respectively 
in the Phase 3 study pool). 
The percentages of patients with discontinuation of FRC due to GI event were low (0.7% due to nausea and 
0.2% due to vomiting) and mostly the events were mild or moderate in severity and occurred with one or two 
episodes per patient. 
The incidence of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia was comparable between subjects on FRC compared 
to subjects on insulin glargine both in insulin naïve patients (25.6% [FRC] vs 23.6% [insulin glargine]) and 
patients earlier treated with insulin (40.0% [FRC] vs 42.5% [insulin glargine].  
The FRC is provided in two different pens with two different ratios between insulin glargine and lixisenatide 
which may increase the risk for medication errors. The number of pen-related events per 100 PYE was in general 
slightly higher for subjects on FRC compared to both subjects on insulin glargine and lixisenatide, respectively.  
None of the-pen related events in any of the treatment groups was associated with a clinical event. “Medication 
errors including mix-ups between the different strength of the product” have been suggested as an important 
potential risk in the RMP and a warning regarding mix-ups between the 2 strength of Suliqua and other 
injectable diabetes medicinal product is reflected in the PIL and SmPC. 
Adjudicated allergic reactions were reported in a low frequency (0.7%) of the subjects on FRC in the Phase 2/3 
study pool. The PT:s of event judged as related to IMP (FRC) were all urticaria. The frequency of subjects 
reporting injection site reactions were seen in 1.7% of the subjects on FRC.  
Development of antibodies against lixisenatide (ADA) occurred in approximately 36% of the subjects on FRC 
over 30 weeks of treatment. High concentrations of ADA have, in a small amount of subjects, shown a trend with 
decreased metabolic control (higher HbA1c) in clinical studies with lixisenatide (EFC11321). However, in the 
present study (EFC12404) most of the ADA positive subjects had low concentrations, below the lower limit of 
quantification (LLOQ).  
In the population without prior treatment to insulin (study 12404), the rate of conversion from AIA negative 
status at baseline to positive status at Week 30, was higher in the FRC group (19%) compared with the insulin 
glargine group (9%). In patients earlier treated with basal insulin (study 12405) the increase was lower and 
Assessment report  
EMA/800280/2016 
Page 106/113 
  
  
more similar between the treatment groups (FRC group15% in the FRC group vs 12% in the insulin glargine 
group). Frequency data regarding development of AIA against FRC and insulin differs between different studies. 
However, there is a consistency among the studies regarding in general low titres of AIA despite treatment 
group and no identified safety problems in relation to AIA positivity. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Experience and exposure of the two mono-components in Suliqua (insulin glargine and lixisenatide) is large and 
long-term safety data are available. There were no new or unexpected safety findings with the fixed combination 
of these products in the presented studies. However, knowledge about unfavourable effects could in many cases 
be extrapolated from knowledge from the two mono-components for example use in very elderly, use in 
subjects with moderate renal impairment, events of pancreatitis, pancreas cancer and cardiovascular safety.   
The incidence of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia was comparable between subjects on FRC compared 
to subjects on insulin glargine. However, the incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes will most probably increase 
when/if the FRC is co-administrated with SU. Therefore section 4.4 of the SmPC includes a warning against the 
combined use of FRC with SU. 
“Medication errors including mix-ups between the different strength of the product” due to the two different 
pens with two different ratios between insulin glargine and lixisenatide with FRC may increase the risk for 
medication errors. This is reflected in the Product Information and as safety concern in the RMP (important 
potential risk). The applicant has proposed to conduct post-marketing cross-sectional surveys to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the additional risk minimization measures regarding medication error (i.e., Healthcare 
professional [HCP] and patient education materials). 
Immunogenicity and development of neutralizing antibodies, especially in treatment of insulin naïve patients is 
an uncertainty. It is uncertain to rely on data from the two mono-components due to a potential risk of antibody 
formation against different epitopes (and different clinical effects) compared to the FRC. However, in the present 
studies no clinical relevance of presence of antibodies against either lixisenatide, insulin glargine or the FRC was 
noted. In clinical practice, the main plausible risk is that if neutralizing antibodies develop a dose adjustment is 
needed and this is reflected in the SmPC. In addition, Immunogenicity/neutralization is characterised as an 
important potential risk in the RMP.

Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Metabolic control in terms of normalising HbA1c is challenging in the T2DM population when metformin 
monotherapy no longer is enough to achieve treatment goals. Therefore, the availability of several treatment 
options is needed to facilitate an individualized treatment strategy. Concomitant treatment with basal insulin 
and a GLP-1 RA can be an important treatment option for patients who are eligible for initiation of insulin 
treatment as well as those in need of intensified insulin treatment. The benefits compared to insulin 
monotherapy include a superior reduction of HbA1c combined with weight stability and a comparable or lower 
risk of hypoglycaemia due to the fact that the insulin doses can be kept at a lower level compared to what would 
be needed to reach the same HbA1c level with insulin only. The disadvantages include the risks associated with 
GLP-1 RA use, mainly GI adverse events. However, such events are in the majority of the cases transient.  
Suliqua has been shown to be efficient in lowering HbA1c, both in insulin naïve patients and in patients switched 
from a basal insulin therapy. The effect was superior to that of both mono-components although the treatment 
difference when compared to insulin glargine could be considered to be of borderline clinical relevance as the 
lixisenatide component contributes less to the glucose-lowering effect of the FRC than the insulin glargine 
component.  However, the data do show that both components significantly contribute to the effect, with insulin 
glargine primarily affecting the overall glucose level as reflected by a decrease in fasting plasma glucose while 
lixisenatide primarily lowers the post-prandial glucose excursions. Compared to insulin glargine, a greater effect 
on HbA1c was achieved without weight gain and at a comparable rate of hypoglycaemias. A similar degree of 
reduction of HbA1c could theoretically have been achieved with a higher insulin dose, but this would most likely 
have resulted in additional weight increase and a higher incidence of hypoglycaemia.  
Co-administration of two injectable medicinal products in one injection is convenient and could possibly increase 
compliance. This advantage should be weighed against the somewhat complicated regimen, which in most cases 
necessitates a change from Pen A to Pen B over time.  
The safety profile of the FRC (fixed-ratio combination insulin glargine/lixisenatide) is in general similar to the two 
included mono-components with no indications of additive toxicity. The incidence of GI adverse events is lower 
compared to lixisenatide given as monotherapy. This can be an advantage even though GI adverse events 
diminish over time.  
In the present Phase 2/3 studies for FRC there were no cases of pancreatitis or increased heart rate of clinical 
importance noted in the FRC group. However, these are unfavourable effects that have been noted for GLP1 RA 
in general (class effects) and thus are putative risks also for the FRC even if this was not demonstrated in the 
presented Phase 2/3 studies. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The benefits of achieving a superior reduction of HbA1c with Suliqua compared to the mono-components in 
combination with weight stability and most likely a lower incidence of hypoglycaemias compared to what would 
be the result of the higher insulin dose needed to reach the same HbA1c target, is considered to outweigh the 
additional risks which mainly included transient GI adverse events. The main target population for Suliqua is 
expected to be patients eligible for initiation or intensification of insulin treatment and where there is a need to 
avoid (further) weight increase.

Suliqua was only studied in combination with metformin in the pivotal studies. Further to this, the only external 
support for the triple combination with other OADs comes from the lixisenatide file where the triple combination 
SU/lixisenatide/insulin glargine was studied.  
However, due to the increased risk of hypoglycaemia, the SmPC for lixisenatide includes a warning against the 
combination for safety reasons. Due to the limitations in the available data, the indication has been restricted to 
the combination with metformin.  
Furthermore, the data in patients switched from basal insulin alone is considered insufficient to allow inclusion 
of this population in the indication, also taking into account that this treatment regimen is not in accordance with 
standard of care. Therefore the target population is restricted to patients failing on oral glucose-lowering 
products alone or combined with basal insulin. 
3.1.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Suliqua is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Suliqua is favourable in the following indication: 
Suliqua is indicated in combination with metformin for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus to 
improve glycaemic control when this has not been provided by metformin alone or metformin combined with 
another oral glucose lowering medicinal product or with basal insulin (see section 4.4 and 5.1 for available data 
on the different combinations). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP 
presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important 
(pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to launch of Suliqua in each Member State, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) must agree the 
content and format of the educational materials for Suliqua, including communication media, distribution 
modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent Authority.  
The educational materials are aimed at increasing awareness about the two available strengths of the 
product and at minimising the risk of medication errors including mix-ups between the different 
strengths of the product. 
The MAH shall ensure that, in each Member State where Suliqua is marketed, all healthcare professionals who 
are expected to prescribe, dispense and patients who are expected to use Suliqua, have access to/are provided 
with the following educational package: 
•  Healthcare Professional Guide; 
• 
Patient Guide. 
The Healthcare Professional Guide shall contain the following key messages: 
• 
• 
Provide patients with the patient guide prior to prescribing or dispensing Suliqua. 
Ensure that your patients and their caretakers are adequately informed on how to use insulin 
glargine/lixisenatide. 
•  Suliqua is supplied in a pre-filled pen and must only be used with this device; healthcare professionals 
must never use a syringe to withdraw insulin glargine/lixisenatide from a pre filled pen or dosing errors 
and serious harm can result. 
•  Suliqua is available in two pre filled pens containing different strengths of lixisenatide, and different dose 
ranges: 
  Both pre filled pens contain insulin glargine in a strength of 100 units/mL 
  Suliqua 10-40 pen allows daily doses between 10 and 40 dose steps of Suliqua to be given 
(strength: insulin glargine 100 units/mL and lixisenatide 50 mcg/mL; dose range: 10 to 40 units 
of insulin glargine in combination with 5 to 20 mcg lixisenatide) 
  Suliqua 30-60 pen allows daily doses between 30 and 60 dose steps of Suliqua to be given 
(strength: insulin glargine 100 units/mL and lixisenatide 33 mcg/mL; dose range: 30 to 60 units 
insulin glargine in combination with 10 to 20 mcg lixisenatide) 
• 
•

  For Suliqua, one dose step always contains one unit of insulin, regardless of the Suliqua pre filled 
pen being used (10-40 pen or 30 60 pen) 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
  The dose counter of the pen device shows the number of dose steps to be injected, 
If the patient has been transferred from a different pre filled pen device, highlight the differences in 
design between the two devices (focus on colour differentiation, warning statements on carton/label and 
other safety design features such as tactile elements on the prefilled pen).  
Explain what the patient should anticipate regarding dysglycemia and potential adverse reactions. 
Pharmacists are encouraged to check that patients and caretakers are able to read the strength of 
Suliqua, the dose range of the pre filled pen and the dose counter of the pre filled pen before dispensing 
insulin glargine/lixisenatide. Pharmacists should also check that patients have been trained on how to 
use the pen.  
Patients who are blind or with poor vision must be instructed to always get assistance from another 
person who has good vision and is trained in using insulin glargine/lixisenatide pen device. 
Tell patients to closely monitor their blood sugar levels when starting insulin glargine/lixisenatide which 
contains insulin glargine and a non-insulin active substance (lixisenatide).  
•  A reminder on the need to report all medication errors with Suliqua will be part of the healthcare 
professional guide. 
The Patient Guide shall contain the following key messages: 
•  Read the instructions in your package leaflet carefully before using Suliqua. 
•  Suliqua is supplied in a pre-filled pen and must only be used with this device; patients, carers and 
healthcare professionals must never use a syringe to withdraw insulin glargine/lixisenatide from a

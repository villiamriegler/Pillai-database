CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Mepsevii is indicated for the treatment of non-neurological manifestations of Mucopolysaccharidosis 
VII (MPS VII; Sly syndrome).  
4.2 
Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be supervised by a healthcare professional experienced in the management of 
patients with MPS VII or other inherited metabolic disorders. Administration of vestronidase alfa 
should be carried out by an appropriately trained healthcare professional with the ability to manage 
medical emergencies. 
Posology 
The recommended dose of vestronidase alfa is 4 mg/kg of body weight administered by intravenous 
infusion every two weeks. 
To minimise the risk of hypersensitivity reactions, a non-sedating antihistamine with or without an 
antipyretic medicinal product should be administered 30-60 minutes prior to the start of the infusion 
(see section 4.4). Infusion should be avoided if the patient has an acute febrile or respiratory illness at 
the time.

The safety and efficacy of vestronidase alfa in patients older than 65 years have not been established. 
No alternative dose regimen is recommended in these patients (see section 5.1).  
Renal and hepatic impairment 
The safety and efficacy of vestronidase alfa in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have not been 
evaluated. No alternative dose regimen is recommended in these patients. 
Paediatric population 
The posology in the paediatric population is the same as in adults. Currently available data are 
described in section 4.8 and section 5.1.  
Method of administration  
For intravenous use only. 
For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
The total diluted volume of the solution for infusion should be administered with a rate titration 
regimen over approximately 4 hours. 
The rate of infusion should be as follows: in the first hour, 2.5% of the total volume will be infused, 
with the balance infused over the subsequent three hours. Any dead space in the lines should be 
accounted for to ensure 2.5% of the total infusion volume is delivered into the patient’s bloodstream 
during the first hour of infusion. The lowest rate administered to a patient in the clinical development 
program was 0.5 mL/hour during the first 30 minutes of infusion, followed by 1 mL/hour over the next 
30 minutes, equalling 0.75 mL as the lowest total volume infused during the first hour.  
Do not flush the line containing vestronidase alfa to avoid a rapid bolus of infused enzyme. Due to the 
low infusion rate, additional sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion may be added 
through a separate line (piggyback or Y tube) to maintain sufficient intravenous flow. After the first 
hour, the rate can be increased to infuse the remainder of the solution for infusion over 3 hours as 
tolerated according to the recommended rate guidelines in Table 2. 
The infusion rate may be slowed, temporarily interrupted or discontinued in the event of 
hypersensitivity reactions (see section 4.4).  
4.3  Contraindications 
Life-threatening hypersensitivity (anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance or to any of the 
excipients listed in section 6.1 (see section 4.4). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
General 
The effects of treatment with vestronidase alfa should be periodically evaluated and discontinuation of 
treatment should be considered in cases where clear benefits (including stabilisation of disease 
manifestations) are not observed. Discontinuation of treatment may cause significant worsening of the 
patient’s clinical status.

As end organ damage progresses over time, it is more difficult for the treatment to reverse the damage 
or to show improvements. It should be considered by the treating physician that the administration of 
vestronidase alfa does not affect the irreversible complications (e.g. skeletal deformities).  
Vestronidase alfa, at the exposure observed in humans, is not expected to cross the blood-brain-barrier 
and therefore it is not likely to impact the neurological manifestations of the disease. 
Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis 
Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with vestronidase alfa; 
therefore, appropriate medical support should be readily available when vestronidase alfa is 
administered (see section 4.8).  
Infusion should be avoided if the patient has an acute febrile or respiratory illness at the time.  
It is recommended that premedication with non-sedating antihistamines with or without antipyretics be 
administered 30-60 minutes prior to the start of the infusion (see section 4.2).  
It is important to administer vestronidase alfa according to the recommended infusion rate schedule 
(see Table 2 in section 6.6).  
If severe hypersensitivity reactions occur, the infusion of vestronidase alfa should be stopped 
immediately and appropriate treatment should be initiated. Management of hypersensitivity reactions 
should be based on the severity of the reaction and include temporary interruption or discontinuation 
of the infusion and/or administration of additional antihistamines, antipyretics, and/or corticosteroids 
for mild to moderate reactions. Consider rapid sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion 
for decreased blood pressure and oxygen for hypoxia. Patients should be observed for a minimum of 
60 minutes after completing the infusion of vestronidase alfa.  
Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions and instructed to 
seek immediate medical care should such signs and symptoms occur. The risks and benefits of re-
administering vestronidase alfa should be considered following a severe hypersensitivity reaction. 
Spinal/cervical cord compression 
Spinal or cervical cord compression is a known and serious complication of MPS VII. During enzyme 
replacement therapy, spinal cord injury can occur due to improved neck and spine mobility. Patients 
with MPS VII receiving vestronidase alfa should be monitored for signs and symptoms of spinal cord 
compression or neck instability including neck or back pain, weakness of limbs, changes in reflexes or 
urinary and faecal incontinence. Appropriate clinical treatment should be immediately sought. 
Sodium restricted diet  
This medicinal product contains 17.8 mg sodium per vial and is administered in sodium chloride 
9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion (see section 6.6). For each vial dosed, including the 
corresponding diluent volume, the sodium intake is 35.5 mg sodium. This amount is equivalent to 
1.8% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for  an adult. Mepsevii is 
considered high in sodium. This should be taken into consideration during dilution of the medicinal 
product for patients on a controlled sodium diet or for those patients with congestive heart failure 
needing to restrict sodium and total water intake. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. Because it is a recombinant human protein and its 
enzyme action is within the lysosome, vestronidase alfa is not expected to interact with other 
medicinal products.

Pregnancy 
There are no data on the use of vetronidase alfa in pregnant women. Animal studies with vestronidase 
alfa do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo-foetal 
development, or pre- and postnatal development (see section 5.3).  
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Mepsevii during pregnancy, unless the 
potential benefit to the mother outweighs the potential theoretical risks to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
There are no data from studies in breast-feeding women. It is not known whether vestronidase alfa is 
excreted in human milk, but systemic exposure via breast-milk is not expected. Due to lack of human 
data, vestronidase alfa should only be administered to a breast-feeding woman if the potential benefit 
of vestronidase alfa to the mother and the benefit of breast-feeding to the infant outweighs the 
potential theoretical risks to the infant. 
Fertility 
No human data are available on the effect of vestronidase alfa on fertility. Animal studies with 
vestronidase alfa do not indicate any impact on male or female fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Mepsevii has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  
4.8 
Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions from 4 clinical trials in 23 patients treated with vestronidase alfa 
were rash (17.4%), urticaria (17.4%), infusion site extravasation (17.4%), anaphylactoid reaction 
(13%), infusion site swelling (8.7%), pruritus (8.7%) and diarrhoea (8.7%). Most adverse reactions 
were mild to moderate in severity.  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions  
The assessment of adverse reactions was based on the exposure of 23 patients from 4 clinical trials, 
aged 5 months to 25 years, who received vestronidase alfa at doses up to 4 mg/kg once every two 
weeks for up to 187 weeks. Nineteen patients were younger than 18 years of age.  
Table 1 lists the adverse reactions reported from 4 clinical trials in 23 patients treated with Mepsevii.

Description of selected adverse reactions  
Febrile convulsion  
One patient receiving a vestronidase alfa dose of 4 mg/kg experienced a febrile convulsion during 
treatment at the week 66, within 3 days of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis vaccination. The infusion was 
stopped, the patient received anticonvulsants, antipyretics and antibiotics, and the febrile convulsion 
resolved. The patient subsequently was re-challenged without recurrence and continued on 
vestronidase alfa treatment. This event was assessed as possibly related to vestronidase alfa due to the 
temporal association with the infusion.  
Immunogenicity 
Eighteen out of 23 patients (78%) from 4 clinical trials developed anti-recombinant human beta-
glucuronidase (rhGUS) antibodies (ADA), ten of whom further developed neutralizing antibodies 
(NAb) on at least one occasion, but not consistently over time. There is no definitive correlation 
between the antibody titre and neutralizing antibody development. In most patients, a pattern of 
attenuated immunogenicity with chronic exposure was suggested by declining antibody titres over 
time on continuous treatment. The presence of ADA (non-NAb and NAb) does not appear to affect 
reduction in the pharmacodynamic marker, urinary glycosaminoglycans (uGAGs) and development of 
hypersensitivity reactions including infusion associated reactions.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is no experience with overdoses of vestronidase alfa. For the management of adverse reactions, 
see sections 4.4 and 4.8.

Mucopolysaccharidosis VII is a lysosomal storage disorder characterised by the deficiency of 
beta-glucuronidase (GUS) that results in glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) accumulation in cells 
throughout the body leading to multisystem tissue and organ damage.  
Vestronidase alfa is a recombinant form of human GUS and is intended to provide exogenous GUS 
enzyme for uptake into cellular lysosomes and subsequent catabolism of accumulated GAGs in 
affected tissues. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The clinical program for vestronidase alfa included 23 treatment naïve patients with MPS VII from 
4 clinical trials, aged 5 months to 25 years, who received vestronidase alfa at doses up to 4 mg/kg once 
every two weeks for up to 187 weeks. Nineteen patients were younger than 18 years of age. 
Studies 301 and 202 
In a multi-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled, blind-start, single-crossover phase 3 trial (study 
UX003-CL301, referred to as study 301), 12 patients with MPS VII received vestronidase alfa 
4 mg/kg every two weeks for 24 to 48 weeks. The patients were randomised in a blinded manner into 
4 groups: 3 patients received vestronidase alfa immediately for 48 weeks (Group A), 3 patients 
received placebo for 8 weeks then vestronidase alfa for 40 weeks (Group B), 3 patients received 
placebo for 16 weeks then vestronidase alfa for 32 weeks (Group C), and 3 patients received placebo 
for 24 weeks then vestronidase alfa for 24 weeks (Group D). Patients who were enrolled in study 301 
were eligible to roll over to study UX003-CL202 (referred to as study 202), an open-label extension 
trial in which patients received additional doses of vestronidase alfa at 4 mg/kg intravenously every 
other week for up to 144 weeks. Ten patients rolled over directly from the end of study 301 to week 0 
of study 202 while 2 patients (17%) had gaps in treatment before enrolling in study 202. 
Of the 12 patients enrolled in study CL301, 4 were male and 8 were female and ranged in ages from 8 
to 25 years (median 14 years). Nine patients were younger than 18 years of age. MPS VII diagnosis 
was confirmed by GUS enzyme activity assay for 5 patients, by genotyping for 3 patients, and via both 
enzyme assay and genotyping for 4 patients. Patients with MPS VII who received hematopoietic stem 
cell transplant therapy were excluded in this study. The extremely small population of patients with 
MPS VII globally necessitated the enrolment of all patients able to participate in this clinical trial, 
resulting in a highly variable group. Clinical endpoints were not assessable in some patients due to 
their extent of disease, age or level of cognition (23 out of 72 assessments [~32%] in 6 domains for 
12 patients were non-assessable at baseline).  
The primary endpoint was the percent reduction in urinary GAG excretion (dermatan sulfate, DS) 
before and after 24 weeks of treatment with vestronidase alfa. The key secondary endpoint was the 
multi-domain clinical responder index (MDRI) score consisting of six domains [six-minute walk test 
(6MWT), forced vital capacity (FVC), shoulder flexion, visual acuity, Bruininks-Oseretsky test of 
motor proficiency (BOT-2) fine motor and gross motor function] after 24 weeks of treatment and 
fatigue total score as measured by the Pediatric Quality of Life Multidimensional Fatigue Scale 
(PedsQL). 
Minimal important differences (MIDs) were pre-specified for the six MDRI domains plus fatigue, 
which are: 6MWT (≥23 meters and ≥10% change from baseline), FVC (5% absolute change or 10% 
relative change from baseline in FVC%pred), shoulder flexion (20 degree change of both shoulder 
range of motion), visual acuity (3 lines (corrected, both eyes)), BOT-2 fine motor (fine motor 
precision: change of 0.72, and manual dexterity: change of 1.47), BOT-2 gross motor (balance: 0.57, 
and running speed and agility: 0.59), and fatigue (10 points of total score). 
Primary endpoint: uGAG reduction 
After 24 weeks of treatment with vestronidase alfa, a rapid and sustained, highly significant reduction 
in uGAG (DS) excretion was achieved with a LS mean (±SE) percentage change of -64.82% 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(±2.468%) (p<0.0001). All 12 patients were responders, pre-specified as ≥ 50% reduction in uGAG on 
at least one visit during the first 24 weeks of treatment. In addition, uGAG response (% change from 
study week 0) shows a similar magnitude of reduction in uGAG in all groups after crossover to active 
treatment. The reductions in uGAG DS that were observed in study 301 were sustained when patients 
(n=12) rolled over into the extension Study 202 and received vestronidase alfa for up to 3.6 years total 
between the 2 studies. Reduction in uGAG DS excretion was achieved with LS mean (SE) percentage 
changes of -62% (4.9%) at study 202 week 0 and -58% (7.2%) at week 48 (n=10). In patients who 
continued beyond study 202 week 48, the mean percentage reduction in uGAG DS was greater than 
70% at all subsequent assessment visits through study 202 week 144 (n=4). 
Key secondary endpoints: multi-domain clinical responder index (MDRI) and 6-minute walk test 
(6MWT) 
For the clinical (secondary) endpoints, beneficial responses were observed although not in all patients. 
After 24 weeks of vestronidase alfa treatment in study 301, the overall MDRI results, both pre-
specified and post-hoc (6 MDRI domains plus fatigue domain) analyses, were positive with an 
increase of +0.5 domains (p=0.0527) and +0.8 domains (p=0.0433) including fatigue, respectively (t-
test). For patients who continued into study 202, a mean (SD) improvement in MDRI was observed at 
week 24 (+0.7 [1.01] domains) and at week 48 (+0.9 [1.30] domains). 
For 6MWT, the distance increased from baseline to treatment week 24 in study 301 by a LS mean 
(±SE) of 20.8 m (±16.75 m) in 9 patients who were able to perform the assessment at baseline and at 
least one post-baseline visit. 6 patients had 6MWT results at treatment week 24. Three of these (50%) 
met the pre-defined MID at treatment week 24 and had sustained walking improvements of 65 meters, 
80 meters and 83 meters. For patients who continued into study 202, 8 patients were able to perform 
the 6MWT at week 48. Sustained 6MWT results were observed with a mean distance of 308.4 m 
(range: 80-556), for a mean (SE) increase from study 301 baseline of 19.0 m (16.4 m).  
Other investigations 
Study UX003-CL201 (referred to as study 201) was a single arm, open-label, dose exploration trial 
that enrolled three MPS VII patients, ranging in age from 5 years to 25 years. After 120 weeks of 
exposure to vestronidase alfa, one patient demonstrated a 21% improvement over baseline in forced 
vital capacity (FVC% predicted) on pulmonary function testing in addition to a 105 meter 
improvement in the 6MWT. Two other patients with baseline hepatosplenomegaly had reduction in 
liver volume (24% and 53%) and spleen volume (28% and 47%) after 36 weeks of treatment.  
Study UX003-CL203 (referred to as study 203) was an open-label, uncontrolled single arm study that 
enrolled eight patients less than 5 years of age who received vestronidase alfa at a dose of 4 mg/kg 
every two weeks for 48 weeks of treatment period and additional up to 240 weeks during optional 
continuation period. The study evaluated reduction of urinary GAG excretion, growth velocity and 
hepatosplenomegaly.  
uGAG reduction 
Treatment with vestronidase alfa resulted in a rapid and sustained, significant (p<0.0001) reduction in 
uGAG DS excretion with an LS mean (SE) percent change of -60% (6.6) at week 4 which was 
sustained at -61% (6.4) at Week 48. Patients who entered the continuation period up to week 132 
experienced further reduction in uGAG DS. 
Growth 
At baseline, all 8 patients had impaired growth. The mean (SD) standing height z-score improved from 
baseline by +0.196 (0.30) at week 48. A non-significant trend toward increased growth velocity was 
observed after vestronidase alfa treatment, from a mean (SD) z-score of -2.59 (1.49) at baseline to-
0.392 (2.10) post-baseline (p=0.27). 
Hepatomegaly 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All patients with hepatomegaly assessed by ultrasound examination at baseline (n=3/8) had decreased 
liver size to within normal range for age and sex prior to study termination. 
Exceptional circumstances 
This medicinal product has been authorised under ‘exceptional circumstances’. This means that due to 
the rarity of the disease, it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal 
product. 
The European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become available every 
year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of vestronidase alfa were evaluated in a total of 23 MPS VII patients including 
19 paediatric patients and 4 adults from 3 clinical trials. After repeated dosing of 4 mg/kg every other 
week, the maximal serum concentration (Cmax) was 17.3 ± 9.6 mcg/mL (mean ± s.d.; range: 4.7 to 
35.7 mcg/mL) and the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to the last measurable 
concentration (AUC0-t) was 50.9 ± 32.2 mcg*h/mL (mean ± s.d.; range: 17.4 to 153 mcg*h/mL). The 
pharmacokinetics of vestronidase alfa are time independent with repeat dosing. The limited 
pharmacokinetic data at steady state suggest dose proportional increase in exposure of vestronidase 
alfa over the dose range of 1 - 4 mg/kg every other week. 
Distribution 
After repeated dosing of 4 mg/kg every other week in MPS VII patients, the mean ± standard 
deviation the total volume of distribution (Vss) was 0.26 ± 0.13 L/kg (range: 0.10 to 0.60 L/kg). 
Biotransformation 
Vestronidase alfa is a recombinant human enzyme and is therefore eliminated by proteolytic 
degradation into small peptides and amino acids. 
Elimination 
After repeated dosing of 4 mg/kg every other week in MPS VII patients, the mean ± standard 
deviation of the total clearance (CL) was 0.079 ± 0.045 L/h/kg (range: 0.038 to 0.20 L/h/kg); the mean 
± standard deviation of the elimination half-life (t1/2) was 2.6 ± 0.6 hours (range: 0.9 to 3.6 hours).  
Excretion 
No excretion studies have been conducted in humans. Vestronidase alfa is not expected to be 
eliminated through renal or faecal excretion.   
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Nonclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, single-dose toxicity in rats, repeated dose toxicity in MPS VII mice and juvenile 
monkeys, fertility and embryo-foetal development in rats or rabbits, and pre- and postnatal 
development in rats. 
Genotoxicity studies and carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with vestronidase alfa. 
Based on mechanism of action, rhGUS is not expected to be tumorigenic.

6.4  Special precautions for storage 
Store in a refrigerator (2 °C – 8 °C).  
Do not freeze.  
Store in the original package in order to protect from light.  
For storage conditions after dilution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. 
6.5  Nature and contents of container  
Colourless glass vial (Type I) with a rubber stopper with fluoro-resin coating, and an aluminium over 
seal with a plastic flip-off cap.  
Pack size: 1 vial containing 5 mL of concentrate for solution for infusion. 
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
Each vial of Mepsevii is intended for single use only. Mepsevii must be diluted with sodium chloride 
9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection using aseptic technique according to the steps described below. 
The diluted solution for infusion should be administered to patients using a low-protein binding 
infusion bag and set (a non di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate [DEHP] bag could be used) and the application 
of an infusion set equipped with an in-line, low-protein binding 0.2 μm filter is recommended. 
1.  Determine the number of vials to be diluted based on the patient’s actual weight and the 
recommended dose of 4 mg/kg, using the following calculations (a-b): 
a.  Total dose (mg) = Patient’s weight (kg) x 4 mg/kg (recommended dose) 
b.  Total number of vials = Total dose (mg) divided by 10 mg/vial 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  Round to the next whole vial and remove the required number of vials (refer to Table 2) from 
the refrigerator to allow them to reach room temperature up to a maximum of 25 °C. Do not 
heat, microwave or shake vials.  
a.  Volume (mL) of calculated dose = Total dose (mg) divided by the 2 mg/mL 
concentration 
3.  Dilute the calculated dose 1:1 using equal volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution 
for injection for intravenous infusion. The total infusion volume is based on the total Mepsevii 
dose and volume (refer to Table 2). The above calculated dose diluted 1:1 in sodium chloride 
9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection should be added to a new empty infusion bag. Dilution 
preparation should be done at room temperature. 
4.  Prior to withdrawing Mepsevii from the vial, visually inspect for particulate matter and 
discolouration. The Mepsevii concentrate solution for infusion should be colourless to slightly 
yellow. Do not use if the solution is discoloured or if there is particulate matter in the solution. 
5.  Slowly withdraw Mepsevii from the appropriate number of vials using caution to avoid 
excessive agitation and any air or frothing. A sufficiently large needle (18 gauge) should be 
used to minimise bubbles in the solution. 
6.  Slowly add Mepsevii to the infusion bag using care to avoid agitation, ensuring liquid to liquid 
contact without generating bubbles or turbulence.  
7.  Gently rock the infusion bag to ensure proper distribution of Mepsevii. Do not shake the 
solution.

safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 
for how to report side effects.  
Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains 
important information for you. 
- 
- 
- 
Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. 
This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them,

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1. 
What Mepsevii is and what it is used for 
What Mepsevii is 
Mepsevii contains an enzyme called vestronidase alfa. This belongs to a group of medicines called 
enzyme replacement therapies. It is used in adults and children of all ages with MPS VII to treat non-
neurological manifestations of the disease (mucopolysaccharidosis VII, also known as Sly Syndrome).  
What is MPS VII 
MPS VII is an illness that runs in families, where the body does not produce enough of an enzyme 
called beta–glucuronidase. 
- 
- 
This enzyme helps to break down sugars in the body called mucopolysaccharides. 
Mucopolysaccharides are made in the body and they help build bones, cartilage, skin, and 
tendons. 
These sugars are re-cycled all the time – new ones are made and old ones are broken down.  
Without enough beta–glucuronidase, parts of these sugars build up in cells, leading to damage 
in the body. 
- 
- 
How Mepsevii works  
This medicine replaces beta-glucuronidase – this helps to break down the sugars that collect in the 
tissues of people with MPS VII.  
- 
Treatment may improve various signs and symptoms of illness, like walking difficulties and 
tiredness. 
Starting treatment early in children may stop the illness getting worse and reduce permanent damage. 
2. 
What you need to know before you are given Mepsevii  
You must not be given Mepsevii 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
If you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to vestronidase alfa or any of the other 
ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor before you are given Mepsevii. 
The effects of treatment with vestronidase alfa should be periodically evaluated and discontinuation of 
treatment should be considered in cases where clear benefits (including stabilisation of disease 
manifestations) are not observed. Discontinuation of treatment may cause significant worsening of 
clinical status. 
It should be considered that the administration of vestronidase alfa does not affect the irreversible 
complications (e.g. skeletal deformities). 
Look out for side effects during or shortly after Mepsevii infusion 
- 
- 
You may have side effects while you are being given Mepsevii or for up to a day afterwards. 
These side effects are called infusion reactions because they are caused by the infusion (drip) of 
the medicine. They may include an allergic reaction (see section 4). If you have an infusion 
reaction, tell your doctor straight away. 
If you have an allergic reaction during your infusion your doctor may slow down, or stop your 
infusion. Your doctor may also give (or have given) you other medicines to manage the allergic 
reaction such as an antihistamine or corticosteroid or an antipyretic, a medicine to reduce fever.  
Other symptoms to look out for 
- 
If you have neck or back pain, feel numb in your arms or legs, or experience lack of control 
over passing water (urine) or stools, tell your doctor straight away. These problems can be 
signs of the illness and may be caused by pressure on your spinal cord. 
Other medicines and Mepsevii 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine. 
You will not be given Mepsevii if you are pregnant unless treatment is clearly necessary. Discuss with 
your doctor if the benefits of using Mepsevii are greater than the possible risks to your unborn baby. 
This is because there is no experience on the use of Mepsevii during pregnancy. 
It is not known whether Mepsevii passes into breast milk, but transfer of the medication to your baby 
is not expected. Discuss with your doctor if the benefits of using Mepsevii are greater than the 
potential risk to your baby while breast-feeding.  
Driving and using machines 
Mepsevii is not likely to affect you being able to drive or use machines.  
Mepsevii contains sodium 
This medicine contains 17.8 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 5-mL vial, 
and is administered with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL as a diluent. Each vial dosed is therefore 
equivalent to 1.8% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. Take 
this into account if you are on a controlled sodium diet. 
3. 
How Mepsevii is given 
Treatment with Mepsevii should be started and monitored by your doctor.  
- 
Your doctor or nurse will give Mepsevii to you by an infusion (drip) into a vein. 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
The medicine has to be diluted before being given. 
Your doctor may give (or have given) you some medicines to manage the allergic reaction such 
as an antihistamine or corticosteroid or an antipyretic, a medicine to reduce fever. 
Dose 
The dose you will receive is based on how much you weigh.  
- 
- 
- 
The recommended dose is 4 mg for each kg of body weight. 
The dose is given every two weeks through a drip into a vein (intra-venous infusion).  
Each infusion will be given over about 4 hours.  
If you are given more Mepsevii than you should 
Mepsevii is given to you and monitored by your doctor. He or she will check that the correct dose has 
been given and take action as needed.  
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Side effects were mainly seen while patients were being given the medicine or within a day after the 
infusion (infusion reactions).  
Serious side effects 
Severe allergic reaction (Very common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people): 
Tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you get any of the following symptoms of a severe allergic 
reaction (anaphylactoid reaction). The infusion will be stopped immediately and your doctor may give 
(or have given) you other medicines to manage the allergic reaction such as an antihistamine or 
corticosteroid or an antipyretic, a medicine to reduce fever. Symptoms of severe allergic reaction may 
include shortness of breath, wheezing, difficulty breathing, and swelling of the face and tongue.  
Other side effects 
Tell your doctor straight away if you notice any of the following side effects – you may need urgent 
medical treatment: 
Very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): 
- 
- 
Hives (urticaria) 
Rash 
Swelling at the infusion site including leaking into the tissue around the vein (infusion site 
swelling or infusion site extravasation) 
Common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Itching of the skin (pruritus) 
Loose stools (diarrhoea)

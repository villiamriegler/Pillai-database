Summary of risk management plan for Orladeyo 
(berotralstat) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Orladeyo. The RMP details important risks of 
Orladeyo, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about 
Orladeyo's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Orladeyo's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Orladeyo should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Orladeyo should be read in the context of all this information including 
the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Orladeyo's RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Orladeyo is indicated for routine prevention of recurrent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in 
adult and adolescent patients aged 12 years and older. It contains berotralstat as the active substance 
and it is taken orally once a day. 
Further information about the evaluation of Orladeyo’s benefits can be found in Orladeyo’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/orladeyo. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimise or further characterise the risks  
Important risks of Orladeyo, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies 
for learning more about Orladeyo's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
• 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analyzed, including periodic safety update report (PSUR) assessment, so that immediate 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Orladeyo is not yet available, it is listed under 
‘missing information’ below. 
 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Orladeyo are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important risks can 
be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of 
a link with the use of Orladeyo. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of 
this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and 
needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal 
product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

II.B Summary of important risks 
Important potential risk: Hepatoxicity 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
The liver was considered a target organ in toxicology 
medicine 
studies due to reversible, non-adverse transaminase 
elevations seen in monkeys dosed for 39 weeks, along with 
hepatocellular hypertrophy. In rats, there were no enzyme 
elevations but there was extrahepatic and liver bile duct 
hyperplasia and phospholipidosis (PLD). In humans, alanine 
transaminase (ALT) elevations and to a lesser degree, 
aspartate transaminase (AST) elevations > 3 × upper limit 
of normal (ULN) have been seen in clinical trials of subjects 
with HAE, but no clinical signs of jaundice, synthetic liver 
dysfunction, or liver injury and no subject met the criteria 
for Hy’s Law. The association is not clear because 
transaminase elevations were not seen in the absence of 
prior androgen exposure, particularly very recently 
exposure. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
An association between prior androgen use and 
asymptomatic elevations in ALT was identified. More 
important than life-time exposure was recent abrupt 
discontinuation of androgens. Prior androgen use is high in 
patients with HAE. In the long-term safety trials, 63.2% of 
subjects had prior androgen use.

Important potential risk: Hypersensitivity 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
During nonclinical development, no hypersensitivity or skin 
medicine 
rashes were noted in any animal species dosed. Delayed 
type hypersensitivity rash was identified as an event of 
special interest (EOSI) during initial Phase 1 studies in 
healthy subjects, but few events have been reported in 
patients with HAE, and these were mild to moderate, self-
limited, and not dose-dependent. The rashes resolved in all 
subjects. Most subjects continued dosing with berotralstat 
without interruption, and the rashes did not reoccur with 
continued dosing, or in cases where dosing was 
interrupted, when berotralstat was restarted.  
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or 
any of the excipients in berotralstat. Human leukocyte 
antigen (HLA) genotyping data indicates that occurrence of 
drug-induced rash after administration of berotralstat, 
which clinically manifested in almost all cases as benign 
self-limited maculopapular rash, was not associated with 
known HLA risk alleles for drug-induced rash. In addition, 
the allele frequencies in subjects with drug-induced rash 
did not indicate increased frequency of any particular HLA 
alleles in affected subjects.

Section II.C) 
Important potential risk: QT prolongation   
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
Studies in nonhuman primate (NHP) showed quantitatively 
medicine 
small drug-related prolongation of the QT interval. 
A thorough QT study was conducted and showed that at 
steady state, the maximum observed plasma concentration 
(Cmax) of berotralstat at the recommended dose of 150 mg 
once daily resulted in a mean corrected QT (QTc) increase 
of 3.4 msec (90% upper confidence interval [CI] bound of 
6.8 msec), which is below the 10 msec threshold for 
regulatory concern. Exposures 4-fold higher than achieved 
at the recommended dose increased the QTc by 21.9 msec 
(mean).  
Based on exposure-response modelling, at the highest 
anticipated clinically relevant exposure in a worst-case 
scenario of GM Cmax of 240 ng/mL, in the setting of hepatic 
impairment (moderate and severe hepatic failure, Pugh-
Child class B and C), the estimated ΔΔQTcF was 7.0 msec 
(2-sided 90% UB 10.9 msec). These values exceed the ICH 
E14 threshold for potential clinical significance. It should be 
noted that in Study BCX7353-108, conducted in subjects 
who had varying degrees of hepatic failure including 
moderate and severe, no clinically significant ECG changes 
were observed, no subject had a change from baseline in 
QTcF > 30 msec, and no subject had a QTcF > 500 msec. 
The study was single dose so the risk cannot be confirmed. 
Subjects with moderate to severe hepatic failure were not 
enrolled in the long-term prophylactic clinical trials and this 
potential effect is based only on modelling.  
Additionally, low weight could increase berotralstat 
exposures. Adolescents and adults weighing < 40 kg were 
excluded from the development program. As weight is the 
primary covariate affecting PK in the population PK model, 
modelling indicates that at lower weights, berotralstat 
exposure is higher than at higher weights. Exposures in 
patients weighing 40 kg do not exceed concentrations at 
which there is a concern for prolonged QT. Modelling 
indicates that at lower weights, around 35 kg, patients are 
simulated to have Cmax exposure of approximately 222 
ng/mL, the concentration at which the 2-sided 90% UB for 
ΔΔQTcF is 10 msec. There is no clinical data in subjects 
 
 
weighing < 40 kg, and it is appropriate to restrict use of 
berotralstat in these subjects.  No dose adjustment is 
required for patients weighing at least 40 kg.  An additional 
analysis of the QT sub-intervals revealed that multiple 
supratherapeutic daily doses of berotralstat prolonged the 
QTc interval but had little effect on the J to T peak sub-
interval, which suggests that the QT prolongation reported 
with berotralstat can be categorized as “benign” and 
unlikely to be associated with proarrhythmic risk, similar to 
marketed drugs ranolazine or verapamil. 
No subject in the 3 long-term prophylaxis studies (204, 301 
and 302), experienced clinically significant QT prolongation.

undifferentiated sarcomas of the skin were found in a 2-
year (lifetime) study in rats administered berotralstat at an 
exposure that was 4.5 times the exposure achieved (on an 
AUC basis) at the clinical 150 mg berotralstat dose. These 
findings are inconclusive, with an incidence slightly higher 
than in control groups. The clinical relevance of these 
findings is unknown. Across the berotralstat clinical 
development program, there was no evidence of 
carcinogenicity. Nevertheless, carcinogenicity is addressed 
as an important potential risk.

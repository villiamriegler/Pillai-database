1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The Applicant GSK Biologicals SA submitted on 25 November 2016 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Shingrix, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.  
The Applicant applied for the following indication: 
Shingrix is indicated for prevention of herpes zoster (HZ) and HZ-related complications, such as post-
herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults 50 years of age or older. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The Applicant indicated 
that Varicella Zoster Virus glycoprotein E antigen was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on Applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain tests or studies. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0168/2013 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0168/2013 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the Applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
New active Substance status 
The Applicant requested the active substance Varicella Zoster Virus glycoprotein E antigen contained in 
the above medicinal product to be considered as a new active substance, as the Applicant claims that it 
is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
Scientific Advice 
The Applicant received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 24 April 2008, 24 September 2009,  
21 January 2010, 19 January 2012, 20 September 2012, 20 March 2014, 1 April 2016 and  
26 May 2016. The Scientific Advice pertained to quality, non-clinical and clinical aspects of the dossier.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Herpes zoster (HZ), commonly known as shingles, is caused by the reactivation of the varicella zoster 
virus (VZV). The clinical manifestation is a unilateral vesicular rash, characteristically restricted to a 
single dermatome, which is usually accompanied by radicular pain along that dermatome. Patients 
experience significant pain and discomfort that may last for weeks, months or even years in severe 
cases, diminishing the quality of life. Mortality rates associated with HZ ranged from 0.01 to 0.46 per 
100,000 persons-years and the majority of deaths occurred in adults ≥ 60 years of age. When 
considering HZ coded as primary and secondary diagnosis, the mortality rate was estimated as 0.29 
per 100,000 person-years in France and 0.6 per 100,000 person-years in Spain. 
Disease incidence 
More than 90% of adults have been infected with VZV and are, therefore, at risk of developing herpes 
zoster.  
Studies using various designs and conducted in different populations in the US, Canada, South 
America, Europe, Asia and Australia showed that the incidence of HZ ranged between 3 and 5 per 
1,000 person-years. The age-specific incidence of HZ is similar across countries, with a steep rise after 
50 years of age. The incidence of HZ was about 6-8 per 1,000 person-years at 60 years of age and 8-
12 per 1,000 person-years at 80 years of age. The incidence and severity of herpes zoster disease 
increase with age, with an exponential increase in incidence after the age of 50 years, which correlates 
with ageing-related decline in cell-mediated immunity. Among adults aged 22 years and over, 
approximately 70% of HZ cases occur after 50 years of age. Among adults who reach 85 years of age, 
it is estimated that approximately half will have suffered at least one episode of HZ.  
A study of 27 countries in Europe showed HZ incidence varying by country from 2.0 to 4.6/1 000 
person-years with no clearly observed geographic trend. Surveillance activities to monitor the 
incidence of herpes zoster and assess the impact of varicella and zoster vaccination are more 
frequently reported from those countries having introduced one or both of these vaccines into routine 
childhood and/or adult immunization schedules. 
There is scarcity of literature on VZV and HZ incidence in low and middle income countries. Most 
estimates of HZ incidence have been made in developed countries with temperate climates. Where the 
burden of disease of VZV and HZ are compared, the burden of HZ is higher, mainly due to longer 
hospital stays. However, challenges with studying the herpes zoster health burden, especially in elderly 
populations, include appropriate attribution of herpes zoster as the primary cause of severe morbidity 
or mortality rather than a contributing cause or a coincidental finding. In developed countries, the 
lifetime risk of herpes zoster disease is approximately 30%. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
Epidemiology of Varicella zoster virus (VZV) 
Since a prerequisite for developing HZ is a past primary VZV infection, the epidemiology of varicella 
may also affect the epidemiology of HZ. There is some variation described in the epidemiology of VZV 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 9/170 
 
  
infection between temperate and tropical climates. More than 90% of primary VZV infections in 
temperate climates occur before adolescence, in contrast to the tropics where a higher proportion of 
adults have not yet been infected with VZV. However, available data on varicella incidence and 
seroprevalence that is representative and population-based, suggest that it is uncommon not to 
acquire varicella by 40-50 years of age even in the tropical countries though exceptions exist, 
especially in island populations such as Sri Lanka.  
Mathematical models that assume that external boosting plays an important role in maintaining VZV 
cell mediated immunity, and thereby delaying the onset of zoster in those who had primary VZV 
infection, predict that universal childhood varicella vaccination immunization programs will impact the 
incidence of herpes zoster, theoretically by reducing exposure to circulating wild virus and subsequent 
boosting. 
Whilst an increase in herpes zoster incidence has been observed in the US and in other countries with 
childhood varicella vaccine programs, increasing trends have been noted in countries not using 
varicella vaccine universally in children. Additionally, in the US, the trend precedes the introduction of 
universal varicella vaccination and the rate of increase in herpes zoster did not change in the pre and 
post vaccine time periods suggesting that other factors are affecting the increase.  
Studies continue to examine this issue and to explore what factors, including potentially vaccination, 
may be responsible for the increasing trend observed widely throughout the developed world.  
Risk factors 
Age is the most important risk factor for development of PHN, with most cases occurring in adults over 
40 years of age and adults over 70 years having a four times increased risk of PHN than those younger 
than 60 years.  
Besides increase in age, immunosuppression from any cause, including hematologic malignancies, HIV 
and immunosuppressive medications, is an important risk factor for herpes zoster, increasing the risk 
of HZ by at least 10-fold. An increased risk of HZ has been reported in infants whose mothers had had 
varicella in pregnancy. Prompt antiviral therapy, if available, is recommended for herpes zoster in 
healthy and immunocompromised patients.  
Ethnicity is also a well described risk factor. Studies in both the US and UK reported that subjects from 
African ancestry and Hispanic ethnicity seem to be less susceptible (about one fourth to a half) to HZ 
than Caucasians. Other identified risk factors include stress or trauma, diabetes and female gender.    
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The VZV remains dormant inside multiple dorsal root ganglia after the initial varicella infection with the 
virus. Subclinical reactivation can occur intermittently in immunocompromised and immunocompetent 
individuals with detection of VZV DNA in the blood with consequent boosting in immunity (endogenous 
boosting) or after exposure to varicella or HZ (exogenous boosting). Some studies have found that re-
exposure to varicella-zoster virus or to children < 10 years is associated with a decreased risk of 
developing herpes zoster at a later stage in life, whereas other studies have not found this association. 
Clinical VZV reactivation (herpes zoster) occurs as result of a reduction in the level of T-cell immunity 
to VZV, described as the main mechanism of protection against herpes zoster, which is observed with 
increasing age. 
Reactivation leads to ganglionitis with damaging of neurons and supporting cells followed by an intense 
inflammatory response. In 70-80% of herpes zoster cases, prodromal pain occurs, restricted to the 
affected dermatome. Vesicles appear for 3-4 days, followed by umbilication, ulceration and crusting of

Page 10/170 
 
  
the lesions. The rash is accompanied by pain which may be severe. The most common serious 
complication of herpes zoster is post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), defined as pain that persists more than 
a defined period of time (90 days was used in the vaccine clinical trials), after onset of rash or after 
cutaneous healing. About 20% of patients with herpes zoster will develop PHN.  
Other serious complications of herpes zoster include blindness secondary to ophthalmic zoster, 
bacterial superinfections of zoster skin lesions and disseminated infections, which occur more 
commonly in immunocompromised patients. Based on limited available data from 366 mothers, herpes 
zoster during pregnancy does not appear to increase the risk of intrauterine infection in the unborn. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation 
Herpes zoster (HZ) is the reactivation of a viral infection caused by the same virus that causes 
chickenpox as primary infection (varicella-zoster virus, VZV). After the primary infection, the virus 
migrates to the central nervous system, where it establishes latency in sensory neurons of cranial and 
dorsal root ganglia. Following a variable period during which it remains latent, it can reactivate later in 
life to cause HZ.  
HZ typically presents as an acute, painful, vesicular eruption distributed along a single dermatome. 
During the eruptive phase, acute local neurological pain occurs in up to 90% of immunocompetent 
individuals. The prodromal phase is typically 3-4 days in duration, but longer durations of ≥ 1 week are 
not uncommon. Fever, malaise and headache may be present. The rash typically heals in 2-4 weeks 
but may leave scaring and pigmentation changes. The median duration of acute pain is 2 weeks. 
Post-herpetic Neuralgia (PHN) is the most common severe complication of HZ and can last for weeks, 
months or even years. PHN is a complex neuropathic pain condition which is a consequence of the 
nerve damage caused by the reactivation of VZV in the ganglia. The more conventional definition of 
PHN is dermatomal pain of clinically significant intensity, persisting at least 90 days after the 
appearance of the acute herpes zoster rash. 
Other less frequent complications of HZ include HZ Ophthalmicus (e.g. keratitis, retinitis, glaucoma, 
optic neuritis), Ramsay Hunt Syndrome (HZ oticus), central nervous system complications (such as 
VZV encephalitis, meningitis, myelitis). Disseminated zoster (> 20 skin lesions outside a single 
dermatome), secondary bacterial infection with Staphylococcus aureus and, rarely, purpura and 
necrosis are also reported. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Treatment of HZ 
Oral antiviral therapy should be commenced as early as possible, within 72 hours of rash onset. 
Treatment is usually given for 7 days in the absence of complications of herpes zoster. Antiviral 
therapies, such as Acyclovir, Famciclovir and Valacyclovir are used in the acute phase of infection with 
the main aims of reducing and/or stopping viral replication, which is thought to play a role in relieving 
pain and shortening duration of symptoms. 
Management of acute pain associated with herpes zoster is complex. A variety of approaches have 
been used with varying degrees of success, including acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
agents, tricyclic antidepressants, opiates, anticonvulsants, capsaicin, and topical anaesthetics. 
Conflicting evidence exists on the use of opioids.  
Management of chronic pain associated with herpes zoster is challenging, too. A recent Cochrane 
review considered all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of antiviral treatment given within 72 hours 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 11/170 
 
  
after the onset of HZ for preventing PHN. The authors conclude that there is evidence that oral 
acyclovir does not significantly reduce the incidence of PHN, while there is insufficient evidence to 
determine the effect of other antiviral treatments. Treatment of PHN is aimed to control symptoms, as 
no disease-modifying therapy is currently available. Furthermore, the addition of systemic 
glucocorticoids to antiviral drugs during the acute phase of HZ does not reduce the incidence of PHN. 
Systemic drugs are combined when pain is moderate or severe, despite the lack of robust evidence 
from RCTs showing a benefit of the combination compared to the single components. Among the 
systemic treatments, there is evidence to support the use of tricyclic antidepressants and the anti-
epileptic drugs gabapentin and pregabalin. A recent Cochrane review has concluded that there is no 
convincing and unbiased evidence of a benefit of oxycodone in treating PHN. 
Treatment may involve topical therapy (lidocaine or capsaicin as first-line treatment for mild pain) and 
systemic therapy, generally with anti-epileptic drugs gabapentin and pregabalin, or tricyclic 
antidepressants. Conflicting evidences exist on the use of potent opioids (such as oxycodone) and 
tramadol in treating PHN. Therefore opioids, including tramadol, should generally be considered as 
third-line drugs for treatment of PHN after consultation with a specialist and should be prescribed only 
with close monitoring. 
Current prophylaxis of HZ 
A live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine (Zostavax, Merck) was first licensed in 2006 and is currently 
licensed in over 60 countries including those in the EU, US, Canada and Australia. This VZV vaccine 
contains an OKA derived VZV strain that is given in a single dose and administered subcutaneously. It 
is licensed for use in immunocompetent individuals 50 years and over in Europe, Australia and the U.S. 
Recommendations for routine vaccine administration have been made in countries in Europe, US and 
Asia including Austria, Czech Republic, France and the UK. 
Zostavax is contraindicated for people with a history of anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction to gelatin, 
neomycin, or any other component of the vaccine; with a history of primary or acquired 
immunodeficiency state, including leukemia, lymphoma, or other malignant neoplasm affecting the 
bone marrow or lymphatic system, or with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or other clinical 
manifestation of infection with human immunodeficiency viruses; those receiving immunosuppressive 
therapy, including high-dose corticosteroids; or those who are or may be pregnant. 
Unmet medical need 
Shingrix was developed to address the medical need to prevent HZ and HZ-related complications such 
as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) in older adults (≥50 YOA) and to address the unmet medical need to 
prevent HZ and HZ complications in IC adults ≥18 YOA. The term HZ/su indicates the herpes zoster 
subunit candidate vaccine (50 μg gE/AS01 B) during clinical development, also called gE/AS01B 
candidate vaccine. Either of these names, but mostly HZ/su, is used in this report to indicate Shingrix. 
About the product 
HZ/su is a recombinant subunit vaccine (VZV gE), designed to induce strong cellular and humoral 
immune responses in individuals with pre-existing immunity against VZV and who are at increased risk 
of developing HZ due to age or immunodeficiency. To enhance both the magnitude and the duration of 
the protection, the gE antigen is combined with AS01 B. HZ/su was designed to be efficacious in 
persons at highest risk for HZ due to their weakened immune systems, in particular adults ≥70 YOA 
and IC adults. In addition, as HZ/su does not contain live virus, it is expected to be suitable for use in 
IC adults.

The HZ/su clinical development was designed to support the marketing authorization of HZ/su as a 
prophylactic vaccine for the prevention of HZ and HZ-related complications in persons at risk of HZ ≥ 
50 YOA.

2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product (FP) is presented as a powder and suspension for suspension for injection 
containing 50 µg of glycoprotein E (gE) antigen (powder) adjuvanted with AS01 B (suspension). 
Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV). gE is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese Hamster 
Ovarian (CHO) cells. The AS01 B adjuvant system is composed of 50 µg each of the immunoenhancers: 
plant extract Quillaja saponaria Molina, fraction 21 (QS-21,  and 3-O-desacyl-4’-monophosphoryl lipid 
A (MPL) from Salmonella minnesota (50 micrograms). These are combined with liposomes, which 
consist of the excipients dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and cholesterol. These and all other 
excipients are listed below. 
Other ingredients are:  
Powder (gE antigen): sucrose; polysorbate 80; sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate; dipotassium 
phosphate.  
Suspension (AS01 B adjuvant system): dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine; cholesterol; sodium chloride; 
disodium phosphate anhydrous; potassium dihydrogen phosphate; water for injections. 
The monodose product (powder and suspension) is supplied in separate type I glass vials with butyl 
rubber stoppers.  
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
VZV gE is the most abundant virion envelope glycoprotein and the predominant VZV glycoprotein 
expressed on the surface of VZV-infected cells. This protein plays a critical role in VZV infectivity as it 
is involved in virus entry and cell-to-cell spread of the virus. Structurally, VZV gE is a monomeric 
transmembrane glycoprotein of 623 amino acids (with a 30-amino acid cleavable signal sequence). 
This protein consists of a hydrophilic extracellular region (amino acids 1 to 544), a hydrophobic 
transmembrane domain (amino acids 545 to 561) and a C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (amino acids 562 
to 623). The truncated version of the protein lacks the transmembrane anchor and carboxy-terminal 
domain and is therefore secreted into the culture supernatant when produced in CHO cells. 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 13/170 
 
  
The product contains an active substance (AS) that has not previously been authorised in the EU and is 
therefore qualified as a new active substance.  
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
The name and address of the manufacturer involved in the manufacture and testing of the active 
Substance (AS) is GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA (Wavre Nord site): Parc de la Noire Epine, Avenue 
Fleming 20, 1300 Wavre (Belgium). 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
VZV gE antigen is produced in a bioreactor at production scale. First, a vial from the working cell bank 
(WCB) is thawed and cell culture is initiated. Cells are expanded at small scale before being transferred 
to the production bioreactor where the gE protein is secreted in the culture medium. At the end of the 
culture step, the harvested culture fluid is clarified by depth filtration. The clarified harvest is further 
processed by several purification steps, including different types of chromatography, ultrafiltration, 
nanofiltration, low pH treatment step for viral inactivation, a nanofiltration and filtration for bioburden 
control before freezing and storage. The filtered bulk antigen is filled into sterile containers and stored 
at -45°C. There is no reprocessing during AS manufacture. 
One single cell culture provides one single harvest (intermediate) on which one single clarification is 
performed. From this, one single batch of gE bulk antigen is obtained by purification (gE Purified Bulk).  
In-process monitoring (PM) tests and Quality Control (QC) tests are used throughout the AS 
manufacturing process and appropriate alert and/or action limits are established from historical data. 
The active substance manufacturing process is considered acceptable. 
Control of materials 
The CHO-K1 cell line used was derived from a parental CHO cell line. For the establishment of the pre-
master cell bank: cells were transfected with the plasmid bearing the coding sequence of a truncated 
VZV gE antigen; a clone expressing high levels of gE was selected and further cultured in serum-free 
conditions.  
The establishment of master and working cell banks (MCB and WCB, respectively) is described as is 
establishment of an end-of-production cell bank (EPC). Testing is in compliance with ICH 5A and 5D 
guidance and relevant Ph. Eur. monographs, confirming identity, freedom from adventitious agents 
and plasmid integrity. Genetic stability of the modified cells was tested by analysis of MCB, WCB and 
EPC. All raw materials and solutions used for cell culture and further steps have been described in 
detail. Evaluation of adventitious agents and TSE safety has been conducted extensively to confirm 
that no undue risk of contamination exists due to the materials applied for manufacture.   
The composition of solutions and materials was provided. No human or animal-derived raw materials 
are used for the AS manufacturing process. Materials of human or animal-derived origin used in early 
steps of cell bank preparation have been adequately evaluated from a TSE and viral safety perspective 
(See adventitious agents section). All raw materials used in the AS manufacturing process are obtained 
with certificates of analysis from their respective suppliers and confirmatory identity and/or release 
testing are undertaken as necessary. Compendial raw materials are tested in accordance with the 
corresponding monograph. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Acceptable information has been provided on the control system in place to monitor and control the 
active substance manufacturing process with regard to critical, as well as non-critical quality attributes 
(QA), process parameters (PP) and in-process tests. Clarification about actions taken if in-process tests

limits are exceeded were provided during the procedure. The company performs Quality Control (QC) 
release tests on the gE single harvest intermediate, on the AS and on the FP.  
The gE Single Harvest step marks the end of the cell culture before purification, and is extensively 
tested for absence of adventitious agents. The gE Single Harvest intermediate is not stored; it is 
processed directly through the purification steps. Satisfactory quality control (QC) release testing 
results from gE single harvests used to prepare commercial and phase III clinical lots are provided. 
These also include testing for bioburden and adventitious viruses. The impact of storage or holding 
time steps applied during the AS manufacturing was approprietely assessed 
Process validation 
Five VZV gE Purified Bulk commercial scale/ process batches were produced at the commercial facility. 
Three of these (referred to as Process Performance Qualification PPQ) lots were used to demonstrate 
consistency and comparability to reference batches (phase III clinical batches and representative 
technical development batches).  
The data includes an extensive technical package including process monitoring tests, process 
measurements, QC release and characterisation tests. All Critical Process Parameters (CPPs) were 
evaluated against the batch documentation targets and/or operating ranges to demonstrate 
consistency and control of the process. Process performance qualification (PPQ) performed by 
production of three full scale PPQ batches were tested and compared to reference batches (phase III 
clinical batches and technical development batches) in terms of manufacturing yield, gE protein 
recoveries and clearance profiles. These PPQ batches complied with the QC release acceptance criteria 
and also the extended characterization criteria including physico-chemical and immunological 
properties of gE. Validation also addressed clearance of host-cell proteins, endotoxin, DNA and 
bioburden. The ultrafiltration membrane and chromatography columns lifetime has been validated. 
A Continued Process Verification (CPV) approach is used to provide assurance that the process remains 
in a state of control during routine commercial manufacturing. Process parameters, process 
performance attributes and product quality attributes are monitored, evaluated for trending, and 
reviewed for potential process improvements. 
In general, the data presented demonstrate that the VZV gE manufacturing process is validated to 
meet process and product requirements. 
Manufacturing process development 
The AS manufacturing process has evolved during clinical and commercial development. As of 2014, 
the AS manufacturing process was transferred to the Company’s commercial facilities and commercial 
gE Purified Bulk batches were produced.  
The main changes introduced throughout development were scale-up, changes in antigen production to 
improve the yield, changes in the purification to improve antigen recovery, addition of a pH treatment 
step to ensure viral clearance robustness, optimization for the chromatography steps, increase of long-
term stability of the active substance by storage of the gE Purified Bulks at -45°C, transfer of the 
manufacturing between different facilities which, for the last manufacturing development step involved 
transfer from the industrialisation facilities to the commercial facilities at Wavre-Nord. 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 15/170 
 
  
Clinical batches applied in Phase III clinical trials have all been derived from full-scale processes that 
were quite close to the final commercial process.  The data reported adequately confirm comparability 
of batches from different process stages.  
A detailed description of the container closure system was provided. Container-closure integrity and 
sterility testing was performed. Leachables and extractables studies were conducted. The container 
closure system is adequately qualified. 
Characterisation 
The physico-chemical (including primary and secondary structure) and immunological properties of the 
AS were assessed using different analytical techniques. The gE antigen is a purified recombinant 
monomeric glycosylated protein; its molecular mass ranges between 67,000 and 68,000 Da, due to 
heterogeneity related to N-terminal clipping and a series of posttranslational modifications, such as O-
and N-glycosylation, sialylation, sulphation and/or phosphorylation. This heterogeneity is inherent to 
the molecule and does not cause concern. Characterisation data are presented for the five gE purified 
bulk batches that were manufactured as part of the first commercial campaign (including the three PPQ 
lots). In addition, for each analytical method used, the data generated on the five batches are 
presented along with data from at least one clinical batch from previous clinical campaigns.  
The characterisation data largely demonstrate that the production process used in the clinical phase III 
and first commercial campaigns results in batches which are consistent and comparable, and in which 
the antigen has retained its physico-chemical and immunological properties, as well as its purity 
profile, after transfer to the commercial facility. 
The process- and product-related impurities present in the AS have been investigated: 
• 
• 
process-related impurities- including HCP, DNA. 
product-related impurities- including degradation impurities. 
The concentration of these impurities was measured in the purified bulks of batches produced for the 
first commercial campaign. DNA clearance was assessed as part of process validation. Other process-
related impurities and host cell proteins were also tested as part of characterisation of the gE purified 
bulk. Overall purity of the AS is very high and levels of process and product-related impurities are 
acceptable (very little protein degradation occurs during manufacture and during shelf life).  
Specification 
The AS specifications include appropriate tests for identity, physiochemical properties (pH, appearance, 
osmolality), antigen content, purity of gE antigen, relative abundance of gE primary sequence, 
impurities and protein content. The specifications are considered acceptable. 
Analytical methods 
For compendial analytical procedures, the company has made reference to Ph. Eur. monographs (pH, 
endotoxin). All in-house analytical procedures for the QC release of commercial gE purified bulks have 
been validated according to the relevant ICH guideline Q2 (R1).  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data (from commercial process and scale PPQ lots) of the active substance (VZV gE 
commercial Purified Bulk) were provided. QC release testing results for additional commercial batches 
of AS were also provided. The results are within the specifications and confirm consistency of the 
manufacturing process.

Reference materials 
A reference standard is used for the following tests: identity gE and antigenic activity gE. The reference 
standard is a gE Final Container development lot. There is no international standard available. 
Stability 
The company proposes a shelf-life of 60 months for gE Purified Bulks stored at - 45°C ± 10 °C.  
Real time, real condition stability data on PPQ batches of active substance from the commercial 
manufacturing process stored in the intended container for 24 months and for up to 7 days under 
accelerated conditions at +37°C ± 2°C were provided. For ongoing studies, in accordance with EU GMP 
guidelines1, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported 
to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
Furthermore, stability data from one phase III Efficacy gE AS batch ( - 45°C ± 10 °C for up to 74 
months, +37°C ± 2°C for 7 days) and three phase III Consistency gE AS lots (- 45°C ± 10 °C for up to 
72 months, +37°C ± 2°C for 7 days) were also provided. 
These stability studies demonstrated that the tested stability-indicating parameters met the 
acceptance criteria for all gE Purified Bulk batches (Phase III Efficacy, Phase III Consistency and 
Commercial Consistency gE Purified Bulk batches). 
Since the Phase III batches can be considered as representative of the commercial product (see AS 
Manufacturing process development section), the proposed shelf-life of 60 months for gE Purified Bulks 
stored at - 45°C ± 10 °C is acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product- AS01B suspension (adjuvant system) 
vial 
The finished product is presented as an adjuvant system vial and a powder vial (antigen). 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development-AS01B suspension 
(adjuvant) vial 
The primary packaging is a type I glass vial with butyl rubber stopper. The material complies with 
Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by 
stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
The AS01 B adjuvant system is composed of two immunoenhancers, QS-21 (a triterpene glycoside 
purified from the bark of the tree Quillaja saponaria Molina) and MPL (3-Odesacyl- 4’-monophosphoryl 
lipid A), using liposomes as a vehicle. MPL is a purified, non-toxic endotoxin derivative prepared from 
the lipopolysaccharide of the R595 strain of Salmonella minnesota and is a compendial excipient. The 
liposomes are composed of dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and cholesterol, buffered saline 
solution. DOPC and cholesterol are the key components of the liposomal bilayer membranes.  
Aside from DOPC and QS-21, all excipients are compliant with Ph. Eur standards. It should be noted 
that QS-21 has not, thus far, been approved in an EU-approved medicinal product (novel excipient). 
Also DOPC and cholesterol are considered as novel excipients since they will be used for the first time 
in an EU-authorised product for intramuscular use. Stability data support the proposed shelf lives for 
QS-21 powder (60 months at -20°C), DOPC (36 months at -20°C) and cholesterol (36 months at -
20°C). All these same excipients have nonetheless, been used for the company’s malaria vaccine,

Mosquirix, which was granted a positive CHMP opinion under Article 58 in June 2015. Appropriate 
information on these novel excipients in line with EU guidance and indeed, relevant information on all 
non-compendial excipients used to manufacture the adjuvant system has been provided.  
With the exception of casamino acids, which are used during the production process of MPL, no 
materials from human or animal origin are used in the manufacture of the AS01B adjuvant system (see 
adventitious agents section for details).  
Non-clinical and clinical studies demonstrated the need for an adjuvant to increase immunogenicity of 
the gE antigen. The AS01 B adjuvant system, including both MPL and QS-21 immuno-enhancers, 
formulated in liposomes, was shown to be the most potent adjuvant system to induce gE-specific 
cellular and humoral responses in mice.  
Important physicochemical and biological properties of the AS01B adjuvant system are adequately 
described in the dossier. The manufacturing process of AS01B adjuvant system has been developed 
through the implementation of a “Series” of manufacturing processes, which reflect changes applied to 
the manufacture of the intermediates, AS01 B formulation or filling, from one “Series” to the next one 
(including site transfer and scale-up).  
A lot history of the AS01 B final container GMP lots used for clinical trials is provided. Consistency and 
comparability between clinical batches and commercial process has been demonstrated at the level of 
the concentrated liposome bulk (CLB) and the QS-21 liquid bulk (LB). For final bulk and the final 
container product, consistency and comparability has been demonstrated between pooled clinical/first 
commercial lots and final commercial process.  
AS01 B adjuvant system manufacturing involves mixing of intermediate bulk components to formulate 
AS01 B final bulk (FB), which is subsequently filled into final containers. A satisfactory evaluation of 
extractables and leachables was performed on the container closure systems used for CLB, QS-21 LB 
and AS01 B.  
AS01 B adjuvant system is part of the AS01 family of adjuvant system that comprises other variants. 
The most closely related is the AS01E adjuvant system which contains half the amount of constituents 
of the AS01B adjuvant system and is part of GSK’s malaria vaccine Mosquirix (positive opinion via 
Article 58 procedure). The manufacturing process and specifications for the different adjuvant 
components, i.e. MPL, QS-21, DOPC and cholesterol, are identical between Mosquirix and Shingrix 
(only the amount of the components in the final adjuvant composition differs between the two 
vaccines).  
Manufacture of the product and process controls-AS01B suspension (adjuvant) vial 
The AS01 B adjuvant system is produced at GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA (Wavre Nord site): Parc de 
la Noire Epine, Avenue Fleming 20, 1300 Wavre (Belgium) and QA conducted at GlaxoSmithKline 
Biologicals SA (Rixensart site): Rue de I’Institut 89, Rixensart (Belgium).  
The manufacturing process of AS01 B adjuvant system comprises the following steps: 
1) Production of intermediate bulk components. 
2) Formulation of AS01 B Final Bulk (FB), which consists of mixing the intermediate bulk components 
and sterile filtration of the resulting formulated solution. 
3) Filling step, in which the formulated FB is aseptically filled into 3 mL vials. 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 18/170 
 
  
 
The control strategy is described and aims to ensure product quality and process performance. QC 
release specifications are established for CLB and QS-21 LB intermediates. Stability data are also 
presented to support storage of these two intermediates .  
Sterile filtration and holding time of the final bulk in specified vessels between formulation and filling, 
has been adequately validated. 
Process validation of AS01 B adjuvant system manufacturing process was performed at the level of the 
two intermediates (CLB and QS-21 LB) as well as for the formulation and filling (including evaluation of 
sterile filtration) steps. 
Product specification- AS01B suspension (adjuvant) vial 
The AS01 B FP specification includes appropriate tests for identity, physiochemical properties, content 
of adjuvant constituents, impurities (sterility). Note that a sterility test (Ph. Eur.) is also part of the 
AS01 B final bulk release specification.  
The potential impurities in AS01 B adjuvant system and their control strategy have been presented. 
Possible impurities are controlled at release of AS01 B or at release of the raw materials. The low levels 
of impurities that may be present in AS01 B FC are clinically qualified and do not pose any safety 
concerns. 
Analytical methods- AS01B suspension (adjuvant) vial 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines.   
Batch analysis- AS01B suspension (adjuvant) vial 
Batch analysis data for at least three batches each of phase III clinical batches and commercial PPQ 
batches were provided. The results are within the specifications and confirm consistency of the 
manufacturing process.  
Reference materials- AS01B suspension (adjuvant) vial 
None of the QC release tests used for the testing of AS01B adjuvant system requires a final container 
lot for calibration and/or quantification. For the quantification of MPL, DOPC and Cholesterol, the 
company uses reference standards obtained from commercial suppliers. These standards are 
accompanied by certificates of analysis. For quantification of QS-21, an in-house produced reference 
standard is used. Qualification of new reference standards is described.  
Stability of the product- AS01B suspension (adjuvant) vial 
The Applicant proposes a shelf-life of 36 months at 2-8°C for AS01 B adjuvant system filled in 3 mL 
glass vials. In addition to the 36 months shelf-life, the AS01 B adjuvant system may sustain exposure 
to temperature excursion for up to 14 days at 25°C during the 36 months shelf-life. 
Long term stability studies, accelerated stability studies (6 months at 37°C) and temperature cycling 
studies have been performed in containers representative of those used for commercial product. The 
temperature cycling stability studies have been designed to include real-time storage at 2-8°C and one 
period of storage for at 14 days at 25°C or 30 days at 30°C, with a return to real-time conditions. This 
storage for up to 14 days at 25°C during the 36 months shelf-life is a temperature excursion agreed 
for the company prior to marketing. 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018

These long-term and temperature cycling stability studies included data up to 60 months on 
development lots and up to 24 months on lots of the commercial process.  For ongoing studies, in 
accordance with EU GMP guidelines, the Applicant has agreed to report any confirmed out-of-
specification result, or significant negative trend, to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
The shelf-life proposed is acceptable.  
2.2.4.  Finished medicinal product- gE finished product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development-gE/AS01 B 
reconstituted FP 
The commercial presentation of gE (finished product) is a monodose vial. This finished product (FP) 
component is a powder containing 50 µg of glycoprotein E (gE) antigen (powder) containing the 
following excipients: sucrose; polysorbate 80; sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate; dipotassium 
phosphate. All these excipients are compliant with Ph. Eur standards. No novel excipients or excipients 
from human or animal origin are used in the manufacture of gE powder.   
The primary packaging of the powder is a type I glass vial with butyl rubber stopper. The material 
complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. Container closure 
integrity has also been investigated. In addition an extractables/leachables study has been performed 
to ensure safety of the container closure system. 
Please see Finished medicinal product- AS01 B adjuvant for details of the adjuvant suspension, used to

Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018

The formulation development of the finished product has been described and mainly involved a change 
from liquid to lyophilised formulation which required the addition of sucrose as a cryoprotectant and 
the subsequent addition of polysorbate 80 to prevent formation of protein aggregates. 
The manufacturing of the gE finished product was initially performed by Henogen S.A. (Gosselies, 
Belgium), now referred to as Novasep for the initial Phase I/II studies. The process was scaled up and 
moved to the GSK industrial development facility for production of additional Phase I/II material. For 
the phase III trials the process was scaled up further. Finally, this process was moved to the GSK 
commercial facility. The lots used for pivotal clinical studies were prepared using AS manufactured 
according to full-scale processes that were close to the final commercial process. The company has 
justified, with appropriate data that changes introduced to establish the commercial AS process results 
in product that is comparable to that prepared using AS used for phase III studies (See AS 
development of the product section). Comparability between phase III FP and commercial FP was 
demonstrated. 
Three FB, final container and reconstituted vaccine commercial PPQ lots were produced to demonstrate 
consistency among the PPQ lots and comparability to the phase III clinical efficacy and consistency lots 
listed. Consistency among the PPQ lots and comparability to reference lots were assessed through a 
technical package including QC release tests, process monitoring tests, process measurements and 
characterisation tests, as appropriate. Acceptance criteria and/or consistency/comparability ranges 
were defined for relevant quality and performance attributes. The comparability assessment of 
commercial lots vs. Phase III clinical materials has shown both materials have similar quality 
attributes, with one exception related to gE methionine oxidation levels. 
The company has observed an increased level of gE methionine oxidation in the first commercial lots 
compared to clinical lots and investigation has concluded that this is due to the residual vaporised 
hydrogen peroxide (VHP) used in the commercial facility for surface decontamination of the isolators.  
This issue has already been addressed in the context of an EMA scientific advice. As recommended by 
the CHMP, the Applicant has validated the methionine oxidation test and demonstrated that methionine 
oxidation raises no safety concerns. The impact on product quality has been investigated by the 
company: using several methods it was shown that secondary and tertiary structure of gE are not 
impacted by the higher levels of oxidation. The impact on immunogenicity and antigenicity has been 
assessed by in vitro and in vivo experiments in mice. The company has performed a safety evaluation 
to define methionine oxidation level which raises no toxicological concerns. The corrective plan for 
adjusting and controlling the methionine oxidation level is acceptable. After implementation of these 
CAPAs the level of methionine oxidation was shown to be decreased in comparison with the first 
commercial lots. The Applicant will further analyse methionine oxidation in a pre-defined number of 
commercial lots.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls-gE FP 
The gE powder vial is produced at GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA (Wavre Nord site): Parc de la Noire 
Epine, Avenue Fleming 20, 1300 Wavre (Belgium) and QA conducted at GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA 
(Rixensart site): Rue de I’Institut 89, Rixensart (Belgium) 
The manufacturing process of the lyophilised gE (gE Lyo) Final Container (FC) is composed of the 
following steps: 
1. Formulation of the Final Bulk-mixing of solutions of buffer, sucrose, and polysorbate 80 (PS80) with 
water for injection (WFI) and the appropriate amount of thawed gE antigen.  
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 21/170 
 
  
 
2. Filling/Freeze-drying- the formulated bulk is sterile filtered. The Final Bulk is aseptically filled into 
vials. Filled vials are then lyophilised, capped and visually inspected.  
3. Labelling and Packaging. 
A control strategy is in place with appropriate in-process monitoring. There is no intermediate 
produced between thawing of the frozen gE purified bulk and the final gE finished product. The 
formulation, aseptic filling and lyophilisation steps have been validated using three PPQ lots.  
Product specification  
The FP specification includes appropriate tests for identity, physiochemical properties (pH, appearance, 
osmolality), potency, impurities (endotoxin, sterility), protein and excipient content. Product is 
released on the basis of individual tests on adjuvant and gE antigen vials and product will be labelled 
with the shortest shelf life. The specifications are acceptable. 
The finding of enhanced gE methionine oxidation levels in commercial lots compared to clinical lots has 
been intensely investigated. As recommended by the CHMP, the Applicant has validated the 
methionine oxidation test and demonstrated that methionine oxidation raises no safety concerns. The 
corrective plan for adjusting and controlling the methionine oxidation level is acceptable. Although 
these data are supportive of licensure, as proposed by the CHMP, the methionine oxidation will be 
further controlled for a given number of commercial lots. Based on the obtained results, it will then be 
decided whether further control (e.g. release testing) of the methionine oxidation level is required or 
whether testing can be omitted (see recommendations). 
Residual hydrogen peroxide (HP) is a potential finished product manufacturing process-derived 
impurity. The HP content in the vials has been calculated to be clearly below the threshold of 
toxicological concern (TTC) value of 1.5 µg/day (dose), as specified in the EMA guideline on limits of 
genotoxic impurities. Aggregation of the gE in the active substance or in the finished product can cause 
product-related impurities. The aggregates concentration measured in both active substance and 
finished product was consistently present in the clinical development. Other AS manufacture-related 
impurities are discussed in the AS characterisation section.  
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines.   
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data (PPQ batches at commercial scale and of the commercial formulation) of the 
Finished Product were provided. The results are within the specifications and confirm consistency of the 
manufacturing process.  
Reference materials 
See AS section for information on the reference standard used. 
Stability of the product 
A shelf-life of 36 months at +2°C/+8°C is proposed for gE lyo final container lots. The finished product 
should be stored in the original package in order to protect from light. 
See stability of the product- AS01 B vial for details of the stability of the adjuvant. Stability studies 
were performed in line with ICH (resembling at least conditions as required by ICH, or more stringent

conditions (worst case, and thus acceptable)). An in-use stability statement, following reconstitution is 
also proposed in the SmPC (not longer than 6 hours at +2°C to +8°C). 
Based on the real-time stability data for the Phase III efficacy (at least 3 lots-60 months), Phase III 
consistency (at least 3 lots-48 months) and commercial consistency PPQ lots (at least 3 lots-24 
months) (in identical primary packaging as proposed for marketing), the proposed shelf-life of 36 
months at +2°C/+8°C is acceptable for gE lyo final container lots. Appropriate stability-indicating tests 
were used. For ongoing studies, in accordance with EU GMP guidelines, any confirmed out-of-
specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. The 
maximal holding time of the gE final bulk is also sufficiently justified by stability data obtained from 
phase III lots and commercial consistency lots. 
The Phase III efficacy and Phase III consistency lot studies also included a temperature excursion of 
+25°C for 14 days or at +30°C for 30 days. The stability of the gE final container lots under stress 
conditions has also been investigated (i.e. exposure for up to 6 months at +37°C or for up to 193 days 
at +25°C). However, the storage conditions as proposed, and approved in the SmPC are +2-+8 °C for 
the duration of the shelf life. 
Stability data were generated for gE final container lots and gE final container lots after reconstitution 
with AS01 B (gE/AS01 B reconstituted vaccine). Stability data of the reconstituted vaccine stored up to 
24 hours after reconstitution at +30°C did not show impact to its physico-chemical properties. From a 
microbiological point of view, the product vaccine should be used immediately. If not used 
immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and 
would normally not be longer than 6 hours at +2°C to +8°C, as stated in the SmPC. 
There is also a statement in the SmPC to store in the original package in order to protect from light. 
Adventitious agents 
The strategy used to ensure that the VZV gE active substance and the resulting Shingrix finished 
product are free of adventitious agents is in compliance with the relevant EU viral safety and TSE 
requirements and includes: control of raw materials; testing of the MCB and WCB, as well as end of 
production cells; in-process testing of harvest for adventitious agents and bacterial contamination and 
viral clearance validation studies. 
Raw materials of human or animal origin were used for the first steps of cell bank system development 
(up to the pre-Master cell bank). A satisfactory evaluation of adventitious agents has been provided for 
these. The risk of TSE contamination is considered negligible due to the origin of the raw materials. 
The risk of other adventitious agent contamination is considered limited due to the process steps.  
Animal/ human origin materials were not used directly for the manufacture of MCB/WCB but have been 
used in the manufacture of media components: 
•  MCB: bovine trypsin -TSE certificate provided, porcine-derived carboxypeptidase B, both used 
in a cell culture ingredient’s manufacture.  
•  WCB: pepticase from bovine milk, beef peptone and beef extract- TSE certificates provided, 
porcine trypsin and L-threonine methyl ester (from porcine gelatin and avian feathers) all used 
in a cell-culture supplement’s manufacture. 
The TSE risk for these is considered negligible due to the origin of these materials and the TSE 
certificates, where applicable. The risk of other adventitious agent contamination is considered limited 
due to the process steps.  
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 23/170 
 
  
 
With the exception of casamino acids, which are used during the production process of MPL (AS01 
adjuvant system), no materials from human or animal origin are used in the manufacturing process of 
AS or FP. This source of casamino acids is compliant with current EU TSE guidelines. 
The AS manufacturing process contains various steps that were shown to contribute to virus 
removal/inactivation: chromatography steps, low pH and viral filtration. Virus removal/inactivation was 
properly validated in appropriate scale-down models using relevant model viruses.  
The results confirm that the purification process has an adequate viral clearance capacity. In 
combination with the testing of starting materials and intermediates this viral clearance capacity 
reduces the risk of viral contamination to a very low and acceptable level.  
2.2.5.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Shingrix consists of 50 μg of the recombinant subunit Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) glycoprotein E (gE) 
antigen combined with GSK’s proprietary adjuvant system AS01 B. The dossier was considered of high 
quality and no major issues were raised during the procedure. 
Active substance 
GSK performs manufacture and release testing of the VZV gE protein active substance (AS) at the 
Wavre site in Belgium. The manufacturing process consists of a conventional fermentation process 
whereby the VZV gE antigen is secreted by the CHO cells into the culture medium. The clarified harvest 
is further processed by several purification and virus inactivation and filtration steps to produce 
purified gE antigen. The filtered bulk antigen is then filled into sterile containers and stored at -45°C.  
Raw materials are described and controlled. Production is done using a two-tiered cell bank system 
which has been properly tested and qualified. No human or animal-derived materials are used in the 
active substance manufacturing process. Comparability studies were performed showing that (phase 
III) clinical lots and PV/commercial lots are comparable.  
The process and process controls are described in detail. Critical process parameters were identified. 
The AS manufacturing process has been adequately validated, including removal of process-related 
impurities, inactivation/removal of potential contaminating viruses, chromatography column lifetime 
studies and intermediate hold studies.  
The quality of the AS is controlled by both in-process controls and release testing. Analytical methods 
were described in detail and were properly validated. Apart from the routine testing, the Applicant has 
also performed additional characterisation testing to verify primary, secondary structure and higher 
order structure, glycosylation pattern, molecular size, purity and biological function of the VZV gE AS. 
Process-related impurities including host cell protein and DNA) were very low and were shown to be 
efficiently cleared by the various process purification steps. 
Acceptable justifications were provided for the specifications. The Applicant has also provided batch 
data for several AS lots. The stability studies demonstrated that all the tested parameters met the 
acceptance criteria for all gE Purified Bulk batches (Phase III Efficacy, Phase III Consistency and 
Commercial Consistency gE Purified Bulk batches). The proposed shelf-life and storage conditions of gE 
Purified Bulks is acceptable.  
Finished product 
gE/AS01 B vaccine, also referred to as Herpes Zoster subunit (HZ/su) vaccine, is a preservative-free 
suspension for intramuscular injection intended for the prevention of Herpes Zoster (HZ) and HZ-

related complications. The vaccine consists of two components: the powder (or lyophilised preparation) 
containing the recombinant Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) glycoprotein E (gE) and a liquid suspension 
consisting of the AS01 B adjuvant system both supplied in monodose vials.  
The pharmaceutical development of the vaccine and the process development were described in detail. 
Initially, the FP was manufactured in the GSK industrial development facility (Rixensart site, Belgium). 
For commercial production the FP manufacturing process was moved to the GSK commercial facility 
(Wavre site, Belgium). Suitable comparability studies were performed showing that (phase III) clinical 
FP lots and commercial FP lots are comparable. 
GSK performs manufacture and release testing of the VZV gE lyo finished product and the AS01B 
adjuvant system at the Wavre site in Belgium. 
AS01B adjuvant system 
The manufacturing process of the AS01 B adjuvant system was described. The different adjuvant 
compounds are added to the formulation tank and homogenized. After sterile filtration the adjuvant is 
filled in glass vials.  
The process and process controls are described in detail. Critical process parameters were identified. 
The FP manufacturing process has largely been adequately validated. Quality of the FP is controlled by 
both in-process controls and release testing. Analytical methods were described in detail and were 
properly validated.  
The novel excipients in the AS01 B adjuvant system, more particularly QS21, cholesterol and dioleyl-
phosphatidylcholine were described. Detailed information was provided on the manufacturing 
processes, product characterisations and product control.  
Specifications are justified. The Applicant proposes a shelf-life of 36 months at +2-+8°C for AS01 B 
adjuvant system filled in 3 mL glass vials. This is acceptable.  
gE lyo FP and reconstituted FP 
The manufacturing process of the lyophilised gE (gE Lyo) final container is composed of the following 
steps: formulation of the final bulk, sterile filtration, filling, freeze-drying, labelling and packaging. The 
process and process controls are described in detail. Critical process parameters were identified. The 
FP manufacturing process has, in general been adequately validated. Quality of the gE FP is controlled 
by both in-process controls and release testing. Analytical methods were described in detail and were 
properly validated. 
In the first commercial batches an increased level of gE protein oxidation was observed in the FP. The 
root cause was the presence of hydrogen peroxide vapour residuals from sterilisation of the filling 
isolators). An investigation showed that this increased oxidation had no impact on the gE protein 
structure or potency. In addition, in vitro and in vivo experimental data also confirmed that the 
oxidation had no impact on the quality and potency of the FP. Nevertheless, after this observation, the 
company implemented measures to reduce hydrogen peroxide vapour in the filling isolators. More 
recent commercial batches show ‘normal’ oxidation levels which remain consistent (comparable to 
those of the clinical batches).  
Specifications were justified. A shelf-life of 36 months at +2°C/+8°C is proposed for gE lyo final 
container lots. This is acceptable. An in-use stability statement, following reconstitution is also 
proposed in the SmPC (not longer than 6 hours at 2°C to 8°C). Product is released on the basis of 
individual tests on adjuvant and gE antigen vials and product will be labelled with the shortest shelf 
life.

2.2.6.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.7.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends one point for investigation as described in the assessment above. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
Nonclinical studies were performed with the gE/AS01 B candidate vaccine formulation, the AS01 
adjuvant system and its immunoenhancers QS-21 and MPL.  
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The HZ/su candidate vaccine is a two-component vaccine consisting of the lyophilized gE antigen and 
the liquid AS01 B adjuvant system, each presented in monodose glass vials. No preservative is included 
in either the gE formulation or the AS01 B formulation. The final product for administration is prepared 
by reconstitution of the lyophilized gE cake with the liquid AS01 B.  
A single human dose (HD) consists of 0.5 mL of gE/AS01 B. The vaccination schedule consists of two 
doses administered 2-6 months apart intramuscularly (IM). One dose of HZ/su contains 50 μg of gE, as 
active ingredient, adjuvanted with AS01 B including 50 μg of each immunoenhancer [3-O-desacyl-4’-
monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and Quillaja saponaria Molina fraction 21 (QS-21)] formulated in 
liposomes [containing dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and cholesterol].  
QS-21 is a water soluble triterpene glycoside with amphiphilic character and known for its haemolytic 
activity. This activity can be eliminated nevertheless through formulation in liposomes in the presence 
of cholesterol as in AS01 (Garçon, 2011 and data from study TNO V20041). MPL is a detoxified form of 
lipid A derived from the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) isolated from bacterial cell walls of the Gram negative 
bacterium Salmonella minnesota R595. Even though detoxified, MPL retains the capacity of the natural 
LPS compound to act as an immunoenhancer.  
Two different gE-based formulations were tested during clinical development: gE/AS01 B and gE/AS01 E 
(see table 2). The adjuvant selection was based on the comparison of the adjuvant system in 
preclinical models, in addition to the clinical experience gained by the Applicant with other candidate 
vaccines containing AS01.

The range of nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology studies undertaken with gE/AS01 B vaccine 
formulation is in agreement with the relevant CHMP and WHO Guidelines. The main studies are: 
• 
Primary pharmacodynamics studied in mice to evaluate cellular and humoral anti-gE antigen 
immune responses and to select the optimal formulations, specific primary pharmacodynamics 
in vitro (human or mouse cells) and in vivo (mice model) to investigate the adjuvanting effect 
of AS01 B and its mode of action (these studies were previously included and evaluated in the 
context of the Mosquirix application), and other studies to support the gE/AS01 B production  
•  GLP-compliant safety pharmacology studies with gE/AS01 B in rats and AS01 B in dogs 
•  Biodistribution of AS01 B components in mice 
•  GLP-compliant toxicology studies include local tolerance and repeat-dose toxicity in rabbits, 
reproductive toxicity and male fertility study in rats. 
Of note, as agreed following CHMP scientific advice, nonclinical toxicity studies with the QS-21 
immunoenhancer were performed using a liposomal formulation of QS-21 (i.e. DQ; for detoxified QS-
21), rather than solutions of QS-21, since DQ corresponds to the physical form of QS-21 in the 
gE/AS01 B vaccine formulation. This liposomal formulation, via the specific inclusion of cholesterol, 
allowed the elimination of the intrinsic haemolytic activity of QS-21. Similarly, the nonclinical 
pharmacology studies with QS-21 were also performed using the DQ formulation. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
There is no appropriate animal model to study Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) pathogenesis, latency or 
reactivation. Hence, no non-clinical data on protection against Herpes Zoster by vaccine candidates 
(challenge studies) were generated. It is considered acceptable that nonclinical pharmacology studies 
are limited to demonstration of immunogenicity. In addition, safety pharmacology studies were 
conducted with gE/AS01 B, AS01 B and MPL.  
An overview of the nonclinical pharmacology testing program for gE/AS01 B and for the adjuvant 
system AS01 is given in tables 3 and 4 respectively.

Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Primary pharmacodynamics studies address (1) immunogenicity of the candidate vaccine, (2) 
bioequivalence of manufacturing changes during development and (3) mode of action of the adjuvant 
system. 
Several studies were conducted to explore immunogenicity of the candidate gE subunit vaccine, 
formulated with different adjuvant systems, including oil-in-water emulsions ± MPL ± QS-21 (AS02, 
AS03), MPL + Alum (AS04), and liposomes + ML + QS-21 at different quantities (AS01). Overall, these 
studies support the need for an adjuvant to induce strong humoral gE-specific immune responses, but 
differences between tested adjuvant systems are rather limited. The choice for AS01 B is mainly based 
on its superior ability to induce cellular immune responses, measured as IFN-γ and/or IL-2 producing 
CD4 T Cells, compared to other adjuvant systems. The Applicant has not generated data on the 
functionality of the gE-antibodies in the non-clinical studies, but virus neutralization assays were 
performed on human sera.  
In conclusion, the need and choice for the AS01 B adjuvant system is supported by immunogenicity 
data. Efficacy (protection against Herpes Zoster) is only addressed clinically, as is the functionality of 
the induced gE-specific antibody response. No additional nonclinical primary pharmacology data were 
requested from the Applicant.  
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 29/170 
 
  
 
Several studies were performed to assess bioequivalence after changes in the manufacturing process. 
Altogether, these data demonstrate that gE antigen produced at different manufacturing scales 
(including final scale) and formulated with AS01 B generate comparable immune response in terms of 
level of gE-specific antibodies and frequencies of gE-specific cytokine-producing CD4+ T cells (IFN-γ ± 
IL-2 producing T cells isolated from the spleen). The geometric mean ratios and the estimated 95% 
confidence intervals are within the [0.5-2] interval, and therefore the lots are considered 
bioequivalent. Likewise, the gE/AS01 B lots produced for the clinical efficacy and clinical consistency 
campaigns and for the clinical consistency and commercial consistency campaigns elicit similar levels of 
gE-specific cellular and humoral responses in mice. 
During the production of gE commercial lots, higher levels of gE methionine  oxidation were observed 
compared to the clinical consistency lots, which was attributed to a transient exposure of gE final bulk 
to vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) residues prior to the lyophilisation step. The Applicant 
demonstrated that artificial oxidation of gE, generate comparable immune responses compared to the 
reference lot in terms of level of gE-specific antibodies and frequencies of gE-specific cytokine-
producing CD4+ T cells (IFN-γ ± IL-2 producing T cells isolated from the spleen). The geometric mean 
ratios and the estimated 95% confidence intervals are within the [0.5-2] interval, and therefore the 
lots are considered bioequivalent.   
The mechanism of action of AS01 and individual components QS-21 and MPL was satisfactorily studied. 
The early response to AS01 has been investigated in a variety of nonclinical studies in order to better 
understand the mechanism behind antigen-specific adaptive responses promoted by AS01-containing 
vaccines. The AS01 adjuvant system differs from other licensed vaccine adjuvants in terms of ability to 
enhance antigen-specific T cell response in several model antigen systems (gE, CSP, HBs, OVA). 
Activation of the innate immune system by AS01 was transient and mediated via TLR4 signalling for 
MPL, while for QS-21 the signalling pathways are not fully elucidated but involve caspase I/ 
inflammasome activation. The maximum adjuvant effect of AS01 on adaptive response, especially T 
cell response, required spatio-temporal co-localization of AS01 with the antigen, consistent with an 
early and locally acting mechanism of the adjuvant. A combination of MPL and QS21 in AS01 induced a 
synergistic response, characterized by increased or sustained cytokine levels, associated with a more 
efficient induction of an adaptive response. For example, IL-6 or IFN-γ  dependent cytokines are known 
to improve antibody and T cell responses respectively. MPL contributed to the early cytokine response 
in the muscle while QS-21 was more important for the early cytokine response in the draining lymph 
node (dLN), consistent with the biodistribution studies. The early IFN-γ secretion by NK within 6h after 
immunization results from a synergy between MPL and QS-21. The MPL and QS-21 combination 
favours a diversified population of activated antigen presenting cells, responsible for T cell priming, 
driven by the specific ability of MPL and QS-21 to activate DC and monocytes respectively. These data 
support addition of both immune enhancers in the liposome formulation.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies were performed, in accordance with the Note for Guidance on 
Preclinical Pharmacological and Toxicological Testing of Vaccines (CPMP/465/95) and Guideline on 
Adjuvants in Vaccines for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/VEG/134716/2004). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology studies are not usually required for adjuvants according to the Guideline on 
Adjuvants in Vaccines for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/VEG/134716/2004). However in line with the WHO 
guidelines on nonclinical evaluation of vaccines, the need for safety pharmacology studies for novel 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018

vaccines, adjuvants and/or other components of the vaccine formulation should be assessed on a case 
by case basis. In this case, safety pharmacology studies in the context of the gE/AS01 B vaccine 
development were deemed relevant only for the AS01 B adjuvant as this is a novel adjuvant system. 
Safety pharmacology studies were performed with the gE (100 μg)/AS01 B vaccine formulation, AS01 B 
and MPL. The study with the gE (100 μg)/AS01 B vaccine formulation was performed in the 
anesthetized rat, studies with AS01 B were performed in the anesthetized rat and in the dog, and the 
safety pharmacology study with MPL was performed in the dog. 
An ICH S7-compliant safety pharmacology study in the conscious Beagle dog with the AS01 B adjuvant 
did not raise any concern on cardiovascular and respiratory function when a full human dose was 
administered. In the anaesthetised rat, no acute cardiovascular and respiratory effects were observed 
after intravascular administration of gE/AS01 B or AS01 B at approximately 140-fold human dose on a 
body weight basis. Previous CHMP scientific advice pointed out that a justification for the choice of the 
rat should be provided as according to ICH S7B the rat is not considered being an appropriate species 
for investigation for the potential to prolong the QT interval (the ionic mechanisms of repolarization in 
adult rats and mice differ from larger species). This is no longer needed in view of the pivotal dog 
study. In addition, no adverse effects on cardiovascular or respiratory functions were observed after 
intravascular administration of MPL in anaesthetised dogs (140-fold human dose on a body weight 
basis). No additional studies are required. 
In addition safety pharmacology studies with AS01 B and MPL were already conducted for and included 
in the applications for other vaccines (Mosquirix, Cervarix and Fendrix). 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies do not apply to vaccines. Therefore, pharmacodynamic 
drug interactions studies were not conducted with the gE/AS01 B candidate vaccine. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics  
Pharmacokinetic studies are usually not required for vaccines based on current guidelines. However in 
some cases, distribution studies may be of value in understanding the mode of action of the adjuvant. 
Given the limited frequency and dose of injection, pharmacokinetic (PK) or ADME (Absorption, 
Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion) studies are not considered relevant for adjuvants or adjuvant 
system. Biodistribution studies with immunoenhancers and adjuvant system have been conducted to 
aid understanding the mode of action of the immunoenhancers and adjuvant system, hence they 
should not be interpreted as PK or ADME studies. 
To understand the mode of action of AS01 B, two mouse biodistribution studies were undertaken GSK-
CH-01-09 with [14C]QS-21 and [14C]DOPC, and GSK-CH-01-015 with synthetic analogue of MPL (i.e. 
RC-529). The latter is a new study and the former was previously included and assessed in the 
Mosquirix application. They support its inclusion in the Applicant vaccine formulations.  
Of note, additional biodistribution studies in rabbit (TSI MASON 2-R89 for 3H-QS-21 in saline solution) 
and rat (Covance 1990/521, Covance 1990/522 for 14C-MPL) were previously included in the Fendrix 
and other Applicant’s vaccine formulations, and thus are not discussed in details in this report. 
Taken together, the biodistribution studies with QS-21 and MPL administered in solution have shown 
that QS-21 and MPL are widely distributed throughout the body and are eliminated within several 
hours (48-168 h). However, the AS01-induced pro-inflammatory response at the injection site is 
transient and is fully resolved by day 7, which suggests that the retention of the MPL is either not due

to TLR4 ligand or alternatively a tolerance mechanism blunting the TLR4 response may also operate 
locally (van Maren, 2008). 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Nonclinical toxicity studies were undertaken with the vaccine gE/AS01 B, the AS01 B adjuvant system 
and its individual immune-enhancers QS-21 and MPL. Most studies were done in rat and rabbit, as both 
species demonstrated a good antibody response. The toxicity studies were usually performed by the IM 
route of administration since this is the proposed route of administration for clinical use. Toxicity 
studies were however also conducted by the SC route of administration to support a specific clinical 
trial. 
Single dose toxicity 
Single dose toxicity and local tolerance were evaluated in rabbits in two studies, with intramuscular 
and subcutaneous administration respectively. The observed slight inflammation at the injection sites 
is considered a direct consequence of an anticipated pharmacological action as it results from the 
stimulation of the immune system. DQ (QS-21) and MPL were considered to be well tolerated in 
supportive single dose toxicity studies with a sufficient safety margin over the anticipated human dose. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Two repeat-dose toxicity studies were performed to evaluate local and systemic effects of gE/AS01 B 
administration. Repeated IM injection of rabbits with the gE (100 μg)/AS01 B vaccine formulation 
induced mild local effects at the injection site. Systemically, only a few haematology and clinical 
chemistry parameters related to the local inflammation were transiently affected by gE (100 
μg)/AS01 B. Recovery of the mild local effects was ongoing in the gE (100 μg)/AS01B vaccine group at 
the end of the study period, four weeks after the last dose. In a second repeated dose study designed 
to compare IM and SC injection with the full human dose of the gE (50 μg)/AS01B candidate vaccine, 
the SC injections produced a lower incidence and severity of microscopically visible reactions at the 
injection site than did the IM injections. These SC data were included in this submission as supportive 
information. All gE/AS01 B treated animals seroconverted as assessed by gE ELISA. Repeated dose 
toxicity has thus been evaluated in one relevant animal species (rabbits) and the studies have been 
conducted according to the relevant WHO and EMA guidelines, including recommendations on dose (full 
human dose), number of doses (exceeding proposed number in the clinic) and of route of 
administration (IM is proposed route of administration for licensure).  
Repeated intramuscular administration of AS01 B in rat and rabbit produced no signs of systemic 
toxicity but did produce a transient acute inflammatory response at the injection site. Systemically, 
only a few haematology and clinical chemistry parameters, and increased body temperature (in the rat 
only), all considered to be related to the local inflammation or the non-specific immune stimulation 
following AS01 B injection, were transiently affected.  
In the repeated dose toxicology studies in rats and rabbits, DQ induced some transient effects on 
haematology and clinical chemistry, and a higher mean body temperature in the high DQ dose group 
24 hours after the first injection in the rabbits, which were considered to be part of the inflammatory 
and immunological processes following injection. Microscopically, some inflammatory response was 
observed at the injection sites, while complete recovery was observed after 28 days. 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 32/170 
 
  
Repeat-dose toxicity studies in which MPL was administered once daily were performed for up to 8 
days in rats and 14 days in Beagle dogs by the intravenous route, maximizing the systemic exposure. 
The no-observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in beagle dogs was 6 µg/kg body weight/day and the 40 
µg/kg body weight/day dose in rats was considered well-tolerated. Effects seen were generally dose-
related (e.g. reversible decreased body weight gain and food consumption; few changes in 
haematology parameters; organ weight increase). The very few effects seen at the lowest dose of 40 
µg/kg body weight/day in the rat were minor and consistent with an immunostimulatory action of MPL, 
such as increased white blood cell (WBC) count and spleen weight. 
Therefore, single and repeated dose studies, including assessment of local tolerance, indicate that 
gE/AS01 B, or the constituents AS01 B, QS-21 (DQ) and MPL, are generally well tolerated by the animals 
at the proposed clinical levels, and the observed effects may be considered expected from the 
stimulation of the immune system. 
Genotoxicity 
The Applicant did not provide genotoxicity data for the final vaccine formulation gE/AS01 B, which is 
considered acceptable. In a rat micronucleus assay, AS01 B showed no evidence of causing micronuclei. 
DQ and/or QS-21 were non-mutagenic in the Ames assay and mouse lymphoma assay. DQ did not 
show any indication of chromosomal damage and/or damage to the mitotic spindle apparatus of the 
bone marrow target cells of male rats. No genotoxic or mutagenic potential was associated with MPL, 
as demonstrated by in vitro mutagenicity (Ames) and clastogenicity (CHO cells) tests, and an in vivo 
rat micronucleus assay. Altogether these data support the lack of genotoxic potential of gE/AS01 B. 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies were not performed. As carcinogenicity studies are not required for final 
vaccine formulations, adjuvants systems and/or immunoenhancers based on current guidelines, this 
was considered acceptable.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
gE/AS01 B and AS01 B reproductive toxicity was assessed in two studies both performed in rats, one 
covering pre-, peri- and post-natal development and one covering male fertility. In addition, for QS-21 
(DQ) and MPL, embryofetal development was assessed in two species, rats and rabbit, and pre- and 
post-natal development was assessed in rats only. Apart from the MPL studies, it is the first time these 
studies are presented for assessment. Although for the target population in the proposed indication (> 
50 years of age) reproductive toxicity is not a major concern, the adjuvant system is likely to be used 
for other vaccine formulations, justifying thorough assessment of these studies at this stage. 
Treatment of male CD rats with 1/5th of a human dose of gE/AS01 B or AS01 B alone on three occasions 
prior to pairing (on Day -42, Day -28 and Day -14) did not affect male mating performance, fertility or 
early embryonic development. At termination, no treatment-related differences were detected in males 
in respect to reproductive organ weights, seminology parameters or macroscopic and microscopic 
appearance of the reproductive tissues.  
Treatment of female CD rats with the candidate vaccine gE/AS01B or adjuvant AS01 B at 40% of the 
full human dose per occasion, on 28 and 14 days before pairing and then on Days 3, 8, 11 and 15 of 
gestation and on Day 7 of lactation was well tolerated by the F0 females with effects restricted to 
slight, transient swelling at the injection site and did not adversely affect embryo-fetal or pre- and 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 33/170 
 
  
post-natal survival, growth or development of the offspring up to Day 25 of age. Serological analysis 
data to support vaccine take in dams, foetuses and pups were provided at request of the CHMP and 
demonstrate vaccine exposure of dams during pregnancy and exposure of foetuses and offspring to 
anti-gE antibodies. 
The potential effects of DQ on female fertility, reproductive performance and on embryofoetal and pre-
/post-natal development were studied in rats and rabbits. DQ, at doses of 4, 20 and 40 μg of QS-
21/occasion (corresponding to 16, 80 and 160 μg/kg of QS-21, assuming a 250 g female rat, 
respectively) did not adversely affect female fertility, embryofoetal or pre- and post-natal survival, 
growth or development of the offspring up to Day 25 of age. The NOAEL of DQ on female fertility, 
embryofoetal and pre and post-natal survival, growth and development is at least the highest dose 
level of DQ tested containing 40 μg of QS-21/occasion, corresponding to 160 μg/kg of QS-21 assuming 
a 250g female rat, therefore exceeding the human dose on µg/kg-basis. 
The intramuscular administration of DQ adjuvant (200 µg/occasion) to New Zealand White rabbits 28 
and 14 days before the start of mating and on gestation days 3, 8, 11, 15 and 24 and on day 7 of 
lactation induced a significant maternal mean body weight loss associated with reduced mean food 
consumption at the end of the gestation period. In addition, lower mean foetal weight was noted at 
this dose level. Defects of the aortic arch (retro or high arched) were observed in three foetuses from 
separate litters suggestive of a possible association with treatment at this dose.  
Malformed kidneys were observed in 2 pups from females mated with the same male, and one pup 
from a female that mated with a different male, therefore excluding a cluster effect. Although historical 
control data and literature references indicate that kidney malformations do occur as a background 
finding in the rabbit, the incidence is very low and it is therefore considered highly speculative to 
conclude that 3 offspring from treated animals (high dose only) are affected by chance. 
Findings in the low dose group (20 µg of QS-21), including malpositioned kidneys, great vessel 
malformation and total litter losses, may be considered incidental based on the historical control data 
assessed. In the absence of adverse effects on maternal condition or embryofoetal and post-natal 
development in the intermediate dose group (100 µg/mL of QS-21), this is considered the NOAEL. PK 
data are not available. As direct comparison to human doses is not possible given the particular 
experimental design of reproductive toxicity studies for vaccines, repeated dosing of a full human dose 
in absence of adverse findings is considered an acceptable safety margin. It is therefore concluded that 
the adjuvant component QS-21 induced potentially treatment related adverse findings including kidney 
and great blood vessel malformations in rabbits but not in rats, at doses considered sufficiently in 
excess over the therapeutic dose.   
Embryofoetal toxicity studies in the rabbit and the rat and a pre- and post-natal development study in 
the rat with subcutaneous administrations of MPL allowed determining a NOAEL of at least 100 
µg/kg/day (maximum dose tested). 
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic data were not generated since the determination of circulating levels of antigens is not 
required for vaccines. This is in line with the Guideline on the nonclinical evaluation of vaccine 
adjuvants and adjuvanted vaccines (WHO, 2013). The absence of toxicokinetic data is considered 
acceptable.

Not applicable. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Inactivated vaccines such as this one are exempted from requirement to conduct environmental risk 
assessment studies due to the nature of their constituents, and this is acceptable, in line with the 
CHMP Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Nonclinical studies were performed with the gE/AS01 B candidate vaccine formulation, the AS01 
adjuvant system and its immunoenhancers QS-21 and MPL. 
In absence of an appropriate animal model to study Varicella Zoster Virus pathogenesis, latency or 
reactivation, it is considered acceptable that nonclinical pharmacology studies are limited to 
demonstration of immunogenicity. Primary pharmacodynamics studies address (1) immunogenicity of 
the candidate vaccine, (2) bioequivalence of manufacturing changes during development and (3) mode 
of action of the adjuvant system. In addition, safety pharmacology studies were conducted with 
gE/AS01 B, AS01 B and MPL. No concerns were identified and no additional studies are required. 
Pharmacokinetic studies are normally not required for vaccines and this is considered acceptable also 
in this case. Several biodistribution studies on the adjuvant system were provided in an effort to help 
understand its mode of action. Genotoxicity data support the lack of genotoxic potential of AS01B. 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of acute and 
repeated dose toxicity, local tolerance, and cardiovascular/respiratory safety pharmacology. Some 
concerns were raised regarding the reproductive toxicity, specifically after administration of QS-21. 
These were addressed for this product even though they are not relevant for the target population in 
the proposed indication (> 50 years of age). The final conclusion on the adjuvant component QS-21 is 
that it potentially induces treatment related adverse findings including kidney and great blood vessel 
malformations in rabbits but not in rats, at doses considered sufficiently in excess over the therapeutic 
dose to raise any concern.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There are no concerns from a non-clinical point of view; this marketing authorisation application is 
approvable. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the Applicant. 
The Applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the

community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
Six GCP inspections were performed at 3 study sites during the conduct of both pivotal studies 
ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022. Deviations from GCP compliance were identified at one site; 
consequently the study site was closed and corrective actions taken to exclude those patients from all 
analyses. A sensitivity analysis was performed to detect safety signals at the impacted site. Sensitivity 
analyses for efficacy could not be performed, but it is considered that the overall efficacy results are 
not impacted.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Biopharmaceutical studies are typically conducted for new drugs. For vaccines, biopharmaceutics 
concerns the bioavailability of the vaccine components after administration. In accordance with the 
EMA Guideline on Clinical Evaluation of New Vaccines (EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/2005) and the EMA 
Guideline on adjuvants in vaccines for human use (EMEA/CHMP/VEG/134716/2004), pharmacokinetic 
studies including bioavailability and bioequivalence studies are usually not required for vaccines. 
Measurement of the plasma concentration of the vaccine over time is not feasible. 
Pharmacokinetic studies might be applicable when new delivery systems are employed or when the 
vaccine contains novel adjuvants or excipients. The need for pharmacokinetic studies and their design 
was discussed during EMA scientific advice. AS01B adjuvant is not included in any EU licensed vaccine, 
but a similar version is included in Mosquirix (intended for use outside the EU). It has been 
characterised extensively in nonclinical pharmacology (PK and PD) studies. The absorption, distribution 
and elimination of AS01, QS-21 and MPL to investigate AS01, QS-21 and MPL-related material was 
investigated following IM administration of AS01B in mice, IM administration of QS-21 in the rabbit and 
IM and intravenous (IV) administration of MPL in rats. Part of the AS01B, MPL and QS-21/DQ toxicity 
and safety pharmacology studies were included in the RTS,S (Mosquirix) application submitted to the 
2 These studies were concluded at the time of the CHMP opinion but the data will be submitted and assessed after 
authorisation

European Medicines Agency (EMA). In addition, the MPL toxicity and safety pharmacology studies were 
included in the Fendrix and Cervarix applications for marketing authorisation submitted to the EMA. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
In relation to vaccines, pharmacodynamic studies are essentially comprised of the immunogenicity 
studies that characterise the immune response to the vaccine. Pharmacodynamic data, which 
comprised the humoral and cell mediated immune responses to the vaccine, were obtained from 
clinical studies. 
Most of the studies were conducted in adults aged ≥ 50 years of age, who were nearly all seropositive 
at enrolment when tested, e.g. in study ZOSTER-006. Two studies were conducted in 
immunocompromised subjects, who enrolled adults ≥ 18 years of age (see section 2.5.4). 
The company submitted a large data package of clinical trials, which consisted of 5 pivotal and 14 
supportive studies. The route of administration and dosing of the glycoprotein gE as well as of the 
adjuvant AS01B were explored in 5 phase I/II studies in support of the clinical development of the 
Phase III trials of HZ/su, during which the immunogenicity and efficacy was investigated in two large, 
placebo controlled efficacy trials, which enrolled more than 16.000 subjects. Within a large lot-to-lot 
consistency study (more than 200 subjects/lot) the similar immune-responses between 3 lots were 
proven. A smaller study was conducted to determine the timeframe of the second dosing between 2 to 
12 months after the first dosing. The 0, 6-month schedule was non-inferior in terms of gE-humoral 
responses compared to the 0, 2 month schedule. The 0, 12 month schedule compared to the 0, 2 
month schedule did not meet the criteria of non-inferiority. 
The results of individual studies are described in their respective sections; section 2.5.3 provides a 
summary of the main immunogenicity results of the pivotal trials (with focus on the pooled analysis) 
and section 2.5.6 presents a summary and discussion of the overall immunogenicity results with 
HZ/su. 
Mechanism of action 
HZ/su has been designed to induce antigen-specific cellular and humoral immune responses expected 
to translate into robust vaccine efficacy in individuals with pre-existing immunity against VZV. VZV gE 
was chosen as the subunit vaccine antigen because of both its prominence as a target for host immune 
responses and its functional significance during viral infection. A truncated version of the protein was 
selected that lacks the transmembrane anchor and carboxy-terminal domains, and is thereby secreted 
into the culture supernatant. In non-clinical studies, vaccination with gE induced anti-gE antibodies 
(Abs) and gE-specific cell-mediated immunity (CMI).  
Non-clinical data further show that AS01B induces a local and transient activation of the innate immune 
system through specific molecular pathways. This facilitates the recruitment and activation of antigen 
presenting cells carrying gE in the draining lymph node, which in turn leads to the generation of gE-
specific CD4+ T cells and antibodies. The adjuvant effect of AS01B is the result of interactions between 
MPL and QS-21 formulated in liposomes. 
The immunogenicity profile of HZ/su vaccine was assessed through the measurement of humoral and 
cellular immune response. 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 47/170 
 
  
Determination of optimal threshold for vaccine response  
Since most subjects of the target population (adults ≥50 YOA) were previously infected with VZV, the 
majority of subjects enrolled in HZ/su studies were expected to be seropositive at pre-vaccination. 
Therefore, the fold-increase over pre-vaccination is a more relevant assessment to evaluate the 
immune response to the candidate HZ vaccine than only simply assessing the antibody concentrations. 
In most clinical studies with HZ/su, the immune response is evaluated in terms of vaccine response 
rate, i.e., the proportion of subjects with a vaccine response, defined as a pre-specified fold increase in 
Ab concentrations over pre-vaccination levels. Hence, the Applicant determined a definition for vaccine 
response. The determination of the optimal threshold for vaccine response is not reported here in full, 
but it was based on the Receiver Operation Characteristic (ROC) curve approach that discriminates a 
non-responder population (placebo recipients post-vaccination) from a responder population (recipients 
of the vaccine one month post-dose 2). This methodology was applied to the data from HZ/su Phase II 
clinical studies ZOSTER-003 and ZOSTER-010. ZOSTER-003 served as learning dataset and ZOSTER-
010 as confirmatory dataset. 
By using this approach, the following thresholds were selected: 1) 4-fold increase over pre-vaccination 
for humoral anti-gE ELISA responses; 2) 2-fold increase over pre-vaccination for gE-specific CD4[2+] T 
cell responses. 
Laboratory Assays 
Laboratory assays that were used in this exercise are summarized in Table 6 (see also following 
sections). Note that at the time of ZOSTER-003, the anti-gE Ab cut-off was defined at 109 EU/mL 
based on the Henogen gE ELISA. At the time of ZOSTER-010, the anti-gE Ab cut-off was defined at 18 
mIU/mL, based on the currently used in-house gE ELISA. At present, the cut-off of this assay is set on 
97 mIU/mL.

The assay cut-off was changed in February 2014 following additional validation experiments from 18 
mIU/mL to 97 mIU/mL. The higher assay cut-off was considered more precise based on additional 
assay validation utilizing VZV-naïve specimens from paediatric subjects.  
Descriptive analysis of immune response parameters 
Depending on the assays performed in each study for the humoral response, the following parameters 
were tabulated by treatment group, overall and by age cohort at the indicated time-points: 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 48/170 
 
  
 
•  Descriptive statistics of anti-gE Ab concentrations (mean, SD, min, first quartile [Q1], median, 
third quartile [Q3], max); 
•  Anti-gE and anti-VZV Ab GMCs with 95% CIs; 
•  Seropositivity rates for anti-gE and anti-VZV Abs (i.e. antibody concentrations ≥ assay cut-off 
value) with exact 95% CIs;  
•  Vaccine response rates (VRRs) for anti-gE and anti-VZV with 95% CIs. The vaccine response 
was defined as a post Dose 2 Ab concentration ≥4-fold the cut-off value for seropositivity for 
seronegative subjects at baseline or at least a 4-fold increase in post Dose 2 Ab concentration 
as compared to the pre-vaccination Ab concentration for seropositive subjects at baseline. 
•  MGI with exact 95% CI for anti-gE Ab concentrations (ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 only). 
•  Distribution of the fold increase from pre-vaccination, i.e., percentage of subjects with a more 
than X-fold (e.g., ≥2, ≥4, ≥6, ..., ≥40 -fold) increase in anti-gE and anti- VZV Ab 
concentrations tabulated per group with 95%CI. 
•  Descriptive statistics (N, mean, SD, min, Q1, median, Q3, max) of the fold increase over pre-
vaccination for anti-gE Ab concentrations. 
Note that the analysis of the humoral immune response was also performed on pooled ZOSTER-006 
and ZOSTER-022 in ≥70 YOA. 
Depending on the assays performed in each study for CMI response (see Table 6), descriptive statistics 
of the following parameters were tabulated by treatment group, overall and by age cohort at the 
indicated time-points: 
•  Descriptive statistics of frequencies of gE and VZV-specific CD4 T cells, secreting at least 2 
different immunological activation markers among IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF-α, and/or CD40L (hereafter 
referred to as CD4[2+]) upon in vitro stimulation with gE and VZV, respectively (N, mean, SD, 
min, Q1, median, Q3, max); 
•  VRRs for gE-specific and VZV-specific CD4[2+] T cells with 95% CIs. VRR for gE-specific/VZV-
specific CD4[2+] T cells is defined as the percentage of subjects who had at least a 2-fold 
increase as compared to pre-vaccination CD4[2+] T cell frequencies (subjects with pre-
vaccination CD4[2+] T cell frequencies above the assay cut-off), or as compared to the cut-off 
(subjects with pre-vaccination CD4[2+] T cell frequencies below the cut-off). 
•  Descriptive statistics of fold increase over pre-vaccination in the frequency of gE-specific and 
VZV-specific CD4[2+] T cells (N, mean, SD, min, Q1, median, Q3, max) 
•  Descriptive statistics of frequencies of gE and VZV-specific B cell memory response (N, mean, 
SD, min, Q1, median, Q3, max). 
Cell-mediated immunity 
The main assays used in the HZ/su clinical studies to evaluate CMI responses were: 
• 
gE intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay: the Applicant has developed and validated an 
ICS assay to measure in vitro the frequency of gE-specific CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from whole blood samples of clinical study participants. 
The gE ICS assay allows measurement of CMI responses induced by HZ/su. The frequency of 
CD4+ T cells is determined through detection of at least 2 of the following immune markers: 
CD40 Ligand (CD40L), Interferon γ (IFN- γ), Tumour Necrosis Factor α (TNF- α), or 
Interleukin-2 (IL-2) upon stimulation with gE peptides. CMI responses were measured in 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 49/170 
 
  
several clinical studies with HZ/su and the purpose varied depending on the phase in clinical 
development:  
- 
- 
Phase I: CMI responses were evaluated to understand the immunogenicity of the vaccine; 
Phase II: CMI (and humoral) responses were evaluated to establish the optimal vaccine 
formulation (both antigen and adjuvant doses), and whether one or 2 doses would be 
used; 
- 
Phase III: CMI data were collected in ZOSTER-006, where it was an exploratory objective 
to further characterize the immune response to the vaccine. 
•  VZV-ICS: In the early CDP (Phase I and II studies), and also in ZOSTER-006, an ICS assay 
measuring the vaccine- induced response by stimulating CD4+ T cells with VZV antigen was 
used to complement the gE ICS assay, and to provide additional characterization of the CMI 
response induced by HZ/su. 
Since CMI responses are believed to be essential for protection against the development of HZ, strong 
and persistent CD4+ T cell responses as elicited by the adjuvanted HZ/su vaccine are believed to be 
key in the efficacy of HZ/su. Therefore, evaluation of CMI responses was the primary objective of 
several Phase I/II HZ/su clinical studies (EXPLO-CRD-004, ZOSTER-003 and their extension studies 
and ZOSTER-010). 
In ZOSTER-006, gE-specific CD4[2+] T cell responses were assessed in the CMI component of the 
immunogenicity subset. One Month post Dose 2, high median frequencies of gE-specific CD4[2+] T 
cells were observed, which were 24.6-fold higher than those pre-vaccination. The gE-specific CD4[2+] 
T cell response was consistently high across age groups. 
In all studies mentioned above, except ZOSTER-003, VZV-specific CD4+ T cell responses were also 
assessed. As was observed for gE-specific CD4[2+] T cells, high VZV-specific CD4[2+] T cell 
frequencies were elicited by HZ/su one month post Dose 2.  
Memory B cell responses specific to gE and VZV were assessed one month post Dose 2 in ZOSTER-003 
in a subset of subjects ≥70 YOA as an exploratory objective in a small sample size. 
Humoral immunity 
The main assay used in the HZ/su clinical studies to evaluate humoral immune was: 
•  Anti-gE enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA): the Applicant has developed and 
validated an ELISA to determine the concentration of IgGs specific to gE in human serum 
samples. This assay allows quantitative measurement of the humoral immune response 
induced by HZ/su. Glycoprotein E is the only VZV-specific antigen in HZ/su. Therefore, 
assessment of gE-specific immunogenicity is the most direct way to confirm immune responses 
to HZ/su. 
In addition, supportive assays were used in the HZ/su clinical studies to complement the results 
obtained with the main assays. The following supportive assays were used: 
•  Anti-VZV ELISA: the Applicant has validated a commercial anti-VZV ELISA kit (Enzygnost, 
Siemens) to determine the concentration of IgG specific to VZV antigens in human serum 
samples. The assay was used in the early CDP (Phase I and II studies) to obtain a general 
understanding of the immune responses against VZV elicited by the gE subunit HZ/su vaccine. 
Moreover, evaluation of the anti-VZV ELISA response elicited by HZ/su provides evidence that 
HZ/su is able to induce immune responses to VZV as was previously observed with the live 
attenuated VZV vaccine (Zostavax). The assay was also used to evaluate a correlation between 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 50/170 
 
  
the anti-gE ELISA and the anti-VZV ELISA. This assay was still performed in the pivotal Phase 
III ZOSTER- 006/022 studies, but as the clinical development advanced (all later Phase III 
studies), the Applicant decided to use the anti-gE ELISA as the core assay and the anti-VZV 
ELISA became redundant. 
•  Anti-VZV neutralization assay: The correlation between antibody concentrations measured by 
the anti-gE ELISA and the VZV neutralizing antibody titres was explored on a subset of post-
vaccination samples from ZOSTER-010 subjects. The anti-VZV Plaque Reduction Neutralization 
(PRN) was not performed in any further clinical studies with HZ/su. 
In all HZ/su clinical studies included in this application, anti-gE Abs were measured by ELISA. In 
ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022, anti-gE Abs were assessed in a subset of subjects. Very high levels of 
anti-gE Ab were reached in the HZ/su group at Month 3 (Median 53,375 mIU/mL) as compared to the 
baseline level (i.e. Median 1283 mIU/mL) in subjects ≥50 YOA (ZOSTER-006). Overall, HZ/su elicited 
higher anti-gE Ab responses one month post Dose 2 compared to placebo. Increases in anti-gE 
antibody concentrations with a VRR of 98.5% in ≥50 YOA and 96.6% in ≥70 YOA were observed. The 
humoral immune response was consistently high across age groups, although it modestly decreased 
with increasing age. For more details see section 2.5.3 on the pooled analysis across ZOSTER-006 and 
-022.  
The cut-off values of anti-gE and anti-VZV ELISA assays were set up at 97 mIU/mL and 25 mIU/mL, 
respectively for the pivotal studies. It was clarified on which basis these values were set and adapted. 
In summary, cut-offs of both anti-gE and anti-VZV ELISAs were determined using representative 
clinical sample panels, allowing an accurate assessment of seroprevalence by both ELISAs. This was 
confirmed in retrospective analyses.  
Immunogenicity data from the pooled analysis ZOSTER-006/-022 measured by the anti-VZV ELISA 
from Siemens became available during the procedure, but is not included in this report. A very good 
correlation was observed between the anti-gE ELISA and anti-VZV ELISA results across the entire 
range of antibody concentrations in post-vaccination samples from Phase II study ZOSTER-010 
(r[Pearson]=0.92). Therefore, anti-VZV ELISA data do not add new information with regard to the 
immunogenicity of HZ/su. 
During the procedure the Applicant was requested to discuss the baseline immunity results against 
Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) by the anti-VZV IgG abs (in addition to the anti-gE abs data), in terms of 
sensitivity/specificity, risk of overestimating seroprevalence levels and comparability among assay. 
This is because most seroprevalence surveys use various VZV IgG assays. The data presented showed 
that the seroprevalence level (seropositivity at baseline) is consistently high (>99%) across studies 
(pooled ZOSTER-006/022 [adults ≥50 years], ZOSTER-003 [adults ≥60 years] and ZOSTER-010 
[adults ≥50 years]), and for both assays (anti-VZV IgG ELISA and anti-gE ELISA). It is concluded that 
given the very high level of baseline immunity (pre-vaccination anti-gE and anti-VZV antibody levels 
well above the defined cut-offs), the risk to overestimate baseline seroprevalence in adults ≥ 50 years 
is very limited by using the Applicant’s anti-gE ELISA. 
Regarding the functionality of the generated anti-gE antibodies, the correlation between antibody 
concentrations measured by the anti-gE ELISA and the VZV neutralizing antibody titres measured by 
the anti-VZV Plaque Reduction Neutralization (PRN) was explored on a subset of post-vaccination 
samples from ZOSTER-010 subjects. This was needed to provide information on the functionality of the 
anti-gE Ab response elicited following vaccination, and to establish whether anti-gE Ab levels measured 
by ELISA are predictive of neutralization titres. Results showed a good correlation anti-VZV neutralizing 
antibody titres with both ELISA assays (anti-gE and anti-VZV ELISA). As a consequence, anti-VZV 
neutralization assay has not been performed in more recent ZOSTER studies, including ZOSTER-006,

as it would not provide substantial new insights into the immune response to vaccination nor would it 
change the conclusions of the study. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
N/A 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
As evaluated in ZOSTER-010, post-vaccination anti-gE ELISA concentrations correlated with VZV 
neutralization titres. At Month 3, the Pearson correlation coefficient and the Spearman correlation 
coefficient were 0.7238 and 0.7412, respectively, indicating a good correlation between log anti-gE Ab 
concentrations and log anti-VZV neutralizing Ab titres. These data indicate that the anti-gE Ab 
concentrations measured by ELISA are predictive of neutralization responses and confirm that Abs 
induced by HZ/su are directed against the native and biologically active form of gE. Therefore the anti-
VZV Plaque Reduction Neutralization (PRN) was not performed in any further clinical studies with 
HZ/su.  
The results from exploratory immunogenicity objective for anti-VZV antibody responses (all time 
points) were considered during the procedure and do not alter the original study conclusions. A very 
good correlation was observed between the anti-gE ELISA and anti-VZV ELISA results across the entire 
range of antibody concentrations in post-vaccination samples e.g. in study ZOSTER-010, which indicate 
that antibodies elicited by HZ/su recognize the native gE present in the anti-VZV ELISA with a high 
specificity. Therefore the decision to use the anti-gE ELISA as the core assay is endorsed. 
Regarding the relationship between cellular and humoral response only a moderately positive 
correlation has been demonstrated between humoral immune responses (based on GMCs for anti-gE 
Abs as measured by anti-gE ELISA) and CMI responses (based on gE-specific CD4[2+] T cell 
frequencies as measured by the gE ICS assay). 
While anti-gE ELISA and VZV-ELISA titres reach a peak level already post dose 1 due to the relatively 
high titres pre-vaccination, VRR GMCs can be increased significantly after a second vaccine dose. This 
observation suggests that HZ/su vaccine induces multiple, yet undefined, immunological pathways. 
Currently, no correlate of protection for HZ/su has been established. As specified in the ZOSTER-006 
protocol, a correlate of protection analysis was performed on pooled ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 
breakthrough HZ cases. See section 2.5.3 on the ZOSTER-006/-022 pooled analysis for details. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The choice of assays for immunogenicity assessment and the results of the correlations across assays 
are endorsed. The candidate HZ/su vaccine elicits a strong humoral and cellular immune response and 
the data are robust. For more details please see section 2.5.3 on immunogenicity results across trials 
and section 2.5.6 on the discussion of the results. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Studies relevant for dosing recommendations are: 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 52/170 
 
  
•  ZOSTER-003: gE antigen dose selection study 
•  ZOSTER-010: adjuvant dose selection study  
Studies relevant for posology recommendations are: 
•  ZOSTER-003 and EXPLO CRD-004: dose number selection studies 
•  ZOSTER-026: flexible dose schedule selection study 
•  ZOSTER-032: SC vs IM route of administration 
Studies ZOSTER-003 and ZOSTER-010, in which different antigen and adjuvant system doses were 
tested, allowed to establish the final vaccine formulation with a glycoprotein dose (50 µg gE) and 
adjuvant dose AS01B in the older population. Two doses of HZ/su were required for optimal immune 
response, based on the observation that 2 doses provided higher gE-specific and VZV-specific CMI and 
humoral responses than one dose of HZ/su, which was investigated in the Phase II trials EXPLO CRD-
004, ZOSTER-003 and ZOSTER-10. Data of the persistence follow-up studies of ZOSTER-003 indicated 
that the vaccine-induced immune response persisted at least around 72 months post Dose 1, following 
a 0, 2 dose schedule. See also section 2.5.3 on Persistence of immune responses (ZOSTER-024 study). 
Non-inferiority in terms of gE ELISA antibody results of study ZOSTER-026 supports a two dose 
vaccination schedule with the doses being administered with an interval of 2 to 6 months. For details of 
study ZOSTER-026 see section 2.5.5.3. 
In the small study ZOSTER-032 administration of HZ/su subcutaneous versus intramuscular was 
investigated. The results in terms of gE antibody titres were similar in both dose groups. However, 
subcutaneous route of administration was not chosen since it was linked to a higher incidence of local 
reactions (see warning in the SmPC).  
2.5.2.  Main studies 
2.5.2.1.  ZOSTER-006  
Study title: A phase III, randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, clinical 
vaccination trial to assess the prophylactic efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of gE/AS01B vaccine 
when administered intramuscularly on a 0, 2-month schedule in adults aged 50 years and older. 
ZOSTER-006 (ZOE-50) is a phase 3 efficacy trial performed in adults 50 years of age (YOA) or older in 
18 countries in Europe, North America, Latin America, and Asia-Australia (268 Principal Investigators) 
in order to assess whether two doses of HZ/su reduce the risk of herpes zoster (HZ). 
A total of 16,145 subjects were randomized 1:1 either to the HZ/su Group (N=8068) or to the Placebo 
Group (N=8077) among whom 14,759 were included in the mTVC for the final efficacy analysis (7344 
in the HZ/su Group and 7415 in the Placebo Group). 
The median follow-up period was 3.1 years (range: 0 to 3.7 years) in the mTVC at the time of the final 
efficacy analysis of HZ endpoint and 4.1 years (range: 0 to 4.5 years) at the time of the End of Study 
on HZ and Post-herpetic Neuralgia (PHN) analysis. 
A pre-specified vaccine efficacy (VE) analysis was performed on pooled ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 
efficacy data in ≥70 YOA at the time both studies were completed. The co-primary objectives of this 
analysis were to evaluate VE in the prevention of overall PHN and to consolidate the VE estimation in 
the prevention of HZ compared to placebo in subjects ≥70 YOA across both Phase III studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018

Persistence of protection against HZ is being evaluated in ZOSTER-049, which follows HZ/su recipients 
from ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 for a duration of at least 10 years after first vaccination. ZOSTER-
049 data were not available at the time of the preparation of this application. 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Subjects were enrolled in the following countries: 
  Australasia: Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, S. Korea, Taiwan. 
  Europe: Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, UK. 
  Latin America: Brazil, Mexico. 
  North America: Canada, US. 
The enrolment target was about 7345 subjects for Europe. The allocation per region was provisional 
and could change depending on the enrolment.  
Eligible subjects were male or female aged ≥ 50 YOA (ZOSTER-006) or ≥ 70 YOA (ZOSTER-022) at the 
time of first vaccination, who provided informed consent and had no prior history of HZ or previous 
vaccination against HZ or varicella.  
Subjects were excluded if he/she had either of: 
  history of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of vaccine 
  acute disease and/or fever at enrolment 
  any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition resulting from 
disease or immunosuppressive/cytotoxic therapy 
  significant underlying illness. e.g. life-threatening disease likely to limit survival to < 4 years 
  any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, could interfere with evaluations 
required by the study. 
Overall inclusion and exclusion criteria in the present study are considered appropriate. 
Treatments 
In both studies, the gE/AS01B vaccine and placebo (NaCl solution) were administered in 0.5 mL 
volume, on a 0, 2-month schedule. The standard route was IM injection in the deltoid of the non-

Page 55/170 
 
  
6.  Duration of pain medication administered for HZ; 
7.  Safety endpoints in a subset of subjects (refer to section 2.6).   
Exploratory endpoints included: Acute HZ severity as determined by the mean Area Under Curve (AUC) 
of the severity-by-duration of HZ-associated pain as measured by the ZBPI during a 4-week period 
following the onset of confirmed HZ in subjects with confirmed HZ; Interference of HZ with QoL as 
measured by ZBPI or EQ-5D or SF-36 in sbj with confirmed HZ; HZ BOI as determined by the mean 
AUC of the severity-by-duration HZ-associated pain during a 26 week period following the onset of the 
HZ rash in the mTVC; CMI in terms of frequencies of antigen-specific (gE and VZV) CD4 T cells at 
Months 0, 3, 14, 26 and 38; Antigen-specific Ab concentrations at Months 0, 3, 14, 26 and 38. The 
latter included anti-gE and anti-VZV Ab concentrations as determined by ELISA (in a subset), and anti-
VZV neutralizing Ab titres as determined by neutralization assay (in a subset). 
Definitions 
Each HZ case is ascertained by clinical criteria and laboratory results. 
  A suspected case of HZ was defined as new unilateral rash accompanied by pain (broadly 
defined to include allodynia, pruritus or other sensations) and no alternative diagnosis. 
Subjects clinically diagnosed as having a suspected case of HZ by the investigator were 
referred to as a case of ‘suspected HZ’. 
  A “confirmed case of HZ” was diagnosed by using standardized and validated real-time PCR 
assay targeting VZV ORF62 (lower detection limit of 10 VZV DNA copies per reaction), or by 
the HZ Adjudication Committee (HZAC) only in case that PCR confirmation is not possible (see 
further below).  
  The HZ onset date was defined as the earlier of the following two events: 1) the HZ rash start 
date; or 2) the date on which pain at the site of a subsequent HZ rash is first noted. 
  The end date of a HZ episode was defined as the first time at which a subject had no rash 
(papules, vesicles, ulcers or crusts) present. 
  Severe ‘worst’ pain was defined as HZ-associated pain rated as 3 or greater on the ‘worst pain’ 
ZBPI question. 
  PHN was defined by the presence of HZ-associated severe ‘worst’ pain that was rated as 3 or 
greater on the Zoster Brief Pain Inventory (ZBPI) questionnaire, persisting or appearing more 
than 90 days after onset of the HZ rash. Alternative definitions of PHN, based on duration of 
pain of 30, 60, 120 and 180 days were also be used for reporting purposes.  
  Cessation of pain was defined as a 28-day pain-free period, and was used to assess the 
duration of HZ-associated pain. If that pain-free period was not achieved, or if pain did not 
cease, the time-to-event was censored at the last day HZ-associated pain was recorded. 
  Acute pain was defined as pain measured during the 4-week period following onset of 
confirmed HZ. 
Ascertainment of suspected HZ cases 
At Visit 1, all subjects had to be educated with regard to the signs and symptoms of HZ and then 
reminded at each visit. The subjects were also given a HZ specific diary card that they were instructed 
to complete as soon as they developed symptoms suggestive of HZ and prior to visiting the study site 
for evaluation of the ‘suspected HZ’. The subjects were invited to visit the study site as soon as 
possible (within 48 hours if possible) for evaluation by the investigator of the ‘suspected case of HZ’. 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 56/170 
 
  
During that visit (first evaluation of the suspected case of HZ [Visit HZ-1 at Day HZ-0]), the 
investigator had to perform a clinical examination. 
For ‘clinically diagnosed suspected HZ cases’, the following procedures had to take place at Visit HZ-1: 
  The completed HZ-specific diary card returned by the subject had to be verified and relevant 
information regarding the HZ episode recorded in the eCRF (such as date of onset of pain and 
rash, date of clinical diagnosis of HZ, location and nature of HZ lesions, HZ-related complications 
if any); 
  The rash had to be documented by digital photography and rash lesion samples (three replicate 
samples on the same day) had to be collected (if not possible, a further visit scheduled to collect 
samples); 
  Concomitant medication, including medication for HZ treatment or any HZ-related complications 
were recorded; 
  Instructions had to be provided to the subjects for completing the ZBPI, EQ-5D and SF-36 
questionnaires. 
After Visit HZ-1, visits or contacts had to take place for follow-up of the HZ episode every week up to 
Day HZ-28. Afterwards, a contact took place at Day HZ-56 and finally at Day HZ-91 (Visit HZ-7). 
Follow-up of HZ-associated pain persisting beyond Day HZ-91 (Visit HZ-7) or other complications had 
to be done at monthly contacts between the subjects and the investigator. At each visit or contact that 
occurred after Visit HZ-1, the study staff/investigator recorded relevant information regarding the 
suspected HZ case (including photographs and samples), concomitant medications and intercurrent 
medical conditions. 
Confirmation of a suspected case of HZ 
A suspected case of HZ could be confirmed in two ways:  
  by PCR using standardised and validated assays and a hierarchical case definition algorithm, 
similar to the algorithm used by Merck in their Shingle Prevention Study (Zostavax efficacy 
study); a β-actin PCR was used as positive control to ensure the validity of the negative HZ PCR 
results. However if no conclusion was possible based on PCRs, then the classification by the HZAC 
(see below) was used to confirm or exclude the suspected HZ case; 
For PCR confirmation, three rash lesion samples from each suspected HZ case were tested, which 
were collected on the same day and of the highest priority lesion type available: 1) vesicle fluid; 
2) crust; 3) crust swab; 4) papule swab. 
  by the HZ Ascertainment Committee (HZAC), who classified all referred cases as either ‘HZ’ or 
‘not HZ’. The HZAC consisted of three to five physicians with HZ expertise that were blinded to 
treatment assignments. Each HZAC member made a clinical determination of every case based on 
review of the available clinical information. A suspected case of HZ was considered as ‘HZ’ if the 
HZAC members concurred unanimously; otherwise, it was classified as ‘not HZ’. Following a 
protocol amendment the following possibility was added: ‘Not able to decide’. Their classification 
served as the final diagnosis of referred cases, only when the case could not be confirmed or 
excluded by PCR.  
Data collection related to pain and QoL 
The Zoster Brief Pain Inventory (ZBPI) questionnaire was supplied to each suspected case of HZ during 
visit HZ-1 and was used to collect information on the severity and duration of HZ-associated pain and 
discomfort (incl. allodynia, pruritus or other sensations) during an HZ episode, on a 0-10 scale and for 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 57/170 
 
  
worst, least, and average pain during the past 24 hours and at that moment. ZBPI question was also 
used to assess HZ interference with subject’s QoL by measuring selected activity of daily life (ADL) on 
7 functional status and ADL items: general activity, mood, walking ability, work, relations with others, 
sleep, enjoyment of life. EQ-5D and SF-36 questionnaires were also supplied for QoL parameter. ZBPI 
questions needed to be completed daily from Day HZ-1 up to Day HZ-28, then weekly from Day HZ-29 
onwards until a 4-week pain-free period is documented. Evaluation of zoster pain persisting beyond 
Day HZ-91 was done at monthly contacts. The ZBPI was developed based on a validated and widely 
used pain severity measure, the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). The ZBPI allows the estimation of pain 
severity as well as a severity-duration measure through the quantification of HZ-specific pain over time 
by using the area under the curve (AUC). This approach estimates the total burden of illness (BOI) 
imposed by HZ.  
The impact of HZ on subject’s QoL was also measured using the EQ-5D and SF-36 questionnaires, to 
be completed weekly during the entire period that the ZBPI questionnaires were completed and until 
HZ-associated pain ceased as defined above. Note that if pain reappeared in the same area after a 4-
week pain-free period and was not accompanied by a new HZ rash, it was assigned to the previous HZ-
episode and triggered again visits/contacts and questionnaires. 
EQ-5D and SF-36 are standardized non disease-specific instruments for describing and valuing health-
related quality of life (HRQoL). Such instruments are increasingly used for the evaluation of health 
care, in population health surveys, as well as in clinical trials. The EuroQoL-5 dimension (EQ-5D) and 
the Short Form-36 (SF-36) are the most widely used generic HRQoL questionnaires. The instruments 
are designed for self-completion by respondents and are available in many languages. Both are based 
on several dimensions of physical and mental health (including social functioning, mobility, physical 
functioning and pain). They yield a single summary score of overall HRQoL which can be used to 
calculate quality adjusted life years (QALYs). 
Evaluation of severity of HZ-associated pain and HZ Burden-Of-Illness score 
HZ Burden-Of-Illness (BOI) score and HZ severity score were derived from the data recorded in the 
ZBPI. Information on HZ-associated pain was derived from the ZBPI question: ‘Please rate your pain 
by circling the one number that best describes your pain at its worst in the last 24 hours’, so called 
‘worst pain’ in the protocol. 
HZ Burden-Of-Illness (BOI) score: for each confirmed case of HZ, responses to the ‘worst pain’ 
question in the ZBPI were used to calculate a ‘HZ severity-of-illness’ score, defined as the area under 
the curve’ (AUC) of HZ-associated pain plotted against time during the 182-day period after the onset 
of the case. A score of 0 was recorded for subjects in whom HZ did not develop during the study 
period. 
HZ severity score: the methodology described for the HZ BOI score was applied to the 4 weeks during 
which a daily measure is taken and provide the HZ severity score. 
Basically, the analysis of QoL and reduction of BOI was based on the Area Under the Curve (AUC) and 
carried out for durations of 30, 90 and 182 days, in the ZBPI evaluable subgroup (who had a first ZBPI 
evaluation visit within 14 days of the first date of rash) and/or the mTVC.

HZ complications 
During the study, digital photographs of the rash were documented, use of medication was recorded, 
and subjects were monitored for zoster-related mortality and hospitalizations and HZ-related 
complications, such as HZ vasculitis, disseminated disease, ophthalmic disease, neurologic disease, 
visceral disease, stroke, which were defined in the study protocol. The presence of HZ complications 
listed below was specifically documented in the eCRF, independently from the AE reporting. If a 
recorded complication was associated with a case of suspected HZ, and that case was finally not 
considered to be a confirmed case, the associated complication was not considered a complication of 
HZ. 
  HZ vasculitis: Vasculopathy or vasculitis (based on clinical, laboratory or radiologic findings) 
that is temporally associated with an episode of HZ and, in the opinion of the investigator, was 
caused directly by the VZV infection arising from the HZ episode. 
  Disseminated disease: Defined as ≥6 HZ lesions outside the primary dermatome as per the 
investigator’s judgment. 
  Ophthalmic disease: Defined as HZ affecting any eye structure as per investigator’s judgment. 
  Neurologic disease: Defined as cranial or peripheral nerve palsies, myelitis, 
meningoencephalitis, stroke, etc. that is temporally associated with an episode of HZ and, in 
the opinion of the investigator, was caused directly by VZV infection arising from the HZ 
episode. 
  Visceral disease: Defined as an abnormality of one or more internal organs (e.g. hepatitis, 
pneumonitis, gastroenteritis) that is temporally associated with an episode of HZ and, in the 
opinion of the investigator, was caused directly by VZV infection arising from the HZ episode. 
  Stroke: A diagnosis of stroke requires that criteria 1, 2 and 3 are fulfilled or criteria 1 and 4 
and in the opinion of the investigator is temporally associated with an episode of HZ. [Criterion 
1: Rapid onset of localising neurological deficit and/or change in level of consciousness; 
Criterion 2: Localising neurological deficit or change in level of consciousness that lasts greater 
than 24 hours; Criterion 3: No other cerebral process, peripheral lesion, or other disorder is 
the cause of the localising neurological deficit or change in level of consciousness; Criterion 4: 
CT scan or MRI scan evidence of an acute thrombotic or haemorrhagic lesion.] 
Additional information on data collection and study duration 
After Visit 3 (Month 1 post vaccination 2), monthly contacts between the subjects and the investigator 
had to take place (except at months that coincide with the subject’s scheduled visits) in order to collect 
information on any event of interest that may have occurred. The subject had to respond to a standard 
set of questions. Information on safety, the occurrence of HZ, and the follow-up of ongoing HZ cases 
was collected. 
Yearly follow-up visits had to be performed at Month 14, Month 26, and Month 38 (Visit 6). 
EQ-5D and SF-36 questionnaires had to be completed by all subjects at study entry, Visits 4 (M14), 5 
(M26) and 6 (M38). Subjects with an ongoing suspected HZ episode had to follow a weekly schedule 
and did not need to additionally complete the questionnaires at these visits. The information from 
these questionnaires was transcribed into the eCRF only for subjects who had suspected HZ during the 
study. 
Each subject had to be followed for at least 30 months after Dose 2. Subjects had to continue in the 
study at least until the cut-off date for end of study analysis regardless of their date of enrolment. The 
exact duration of the study for individual subjects could thus vary. The maximum total study duration 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 59/170 
 
  
for each subject was expected to be approximately 4 to 5 years. Final HZ efficacy analysis could be 
triggered before study conclusion for several subjects. 
B.  Immunological endpoints 
Blood samples had to be collected: 
  From all subjects at Visit 1 (Month 0) and 3 (Month 3) to contribute to the correlate of 
protection assessment (should the subject experience a HZ episode or be selected as a 
control). 
  From a subset of subjects at Visit 4 (Month 14), 5 (Month 26) and 6 (Month 38) to assess 
persistence of humoral immune response. In these subjects, the blood samples from Visit 1 
and 3 were also assessed for humoral immune response. 
  From a subset of subjects at Visit 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 to assess cell mediated immunogenicity 
(CMI) response. 
For subjects included in the Immunogenicity subset (humoral immunity), the following assays were 
planned for humoral immunity (Antibody determination) at specified time points: 
  Varicella Zoster Virus Ab IgG (ELISA), i.e. anti-VZV Abs. 
  gE Ab IgG (ELISA) i.e. anti-gE Abs. 
  Varicella Zoster Virus Neutralizing Ab IgG (PRNT), i.e. anti-VZV neutralizing Ab assay on the 
serum blood samples from a subgroup of subjects of the Immunogenicity subset. 
For a subgroup of subjects included in the CMI component of the Immunogenicity subset, the 
frequencies of gE- and VZV-specific CD4 T cells determined by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) of 
IFN-gamma and/or IL-2 and/or TNFa and/or CD40L were measured. All assays were validated. 
The cut-off values of anti-gE and anti-VZV ELISA assays were set up at 97 mIU/mL and 25 mIU/mL, 
respectively. A seronegative subject is a subject whose Ab concentration is below the cut-off value. 
A seropositive subject is a subject whose Ab concentration is greater than or equal to the cut-off value. 
The VZV gE-specific humoral immune response to vaccine (vaccine response rate) for subjects who are 
seropositive at baseline is defined as a 4-fold increase in the anti-gE Ab concentration at the endpoint 
as compared to the pre-vaccination anti-gE antibody concentration. The VZV gE-specific humoral 
immune response to vaccine for subjects who are seronegative at baseline is defined as a 4-fold 
increase in the anti gE Ab concentration at the endpoint as compared to the anti-gE Ab cut-off value 
for seropositivity. 
gE/VZV-specific CMI responses were expressed by gE/VZV-specific frequencies of CD4[2+] T cells, 
which were obtained by subtracting the response to stimulation with medium only. 
For other immunological measurements refer to section 2.4.3. 
Results obtained for the anti-gE and anti-VZV Ab ELISA assays were planned to be used for correlate 
of protection analysis. In study ZOSTER-006 attempts were made to correlate humoral immune 
responses at Month 3 with protection. Therefore, analysis of the humoral immune responses at pre-
vaccination and Month 3 were performed on samples collected from vaccinated subjects who develop 
confirmed HZ and compared with the humoral immune responses at pre-vaccination and Month 3 from 
matched subjects that did not develop HZ. 
Overall, trial’s endpoints are relevant and well defined. Study procedures to ascertain these endpoints 
are carefully designed. The detection of HZ events and their virological confirmation (primary endpoint) 
rely on particularly well designed and reliable methods and procedures. In addition, the Applicant 
undertook a comprehensive assessment of HZ-associated pain and impact on quality of life by using 
relevant and validated tools. The use of a variety of methods reinforces the robustness of the data.

Sample size 
Target enrolment was 15,980 eligible subjects (7,990 in the vaccine group and 7,990 in the placebo 
group). This sample size was selected in order to provide the required number of HZ cases within a 
follow-up time of about 3 years.  
The following age-stratification ratio was applied: 8:5:3:1 (50-59, 60-69, 70-79 and ≥80 YOA) using a 
randomization ratio 1:1 for vaccine or placebo. The stratification ratios were selected in order to 
achieve similar numbers of HZ cases in the three main age strata (50-59 YOA, 60-69 YOA and ≥70 
YOA). These numbers were finally not reached as the incidence did not increase with age as expected 
(table 7). Simulations were performed to estimate the sample size required as a consequence of 
unequal VE estimates by age strata. A drop-out rate of 5% per year and an incidence of 5% for non-
compliance to vaccine schedule were taken into account for sample size calculations leading to a total 
sample size of 15,980 subjects. Apportionment of approximately 20-25% of the ≥70 YOA cohort to 
persons ≥80 YOA aimed to ensure that this particularly vulnerable population was adequately 
represented. The study was however not powered to demonstrate efficacy in any of the 2 sub-strata 
taken separately.   
The cut-off date for final HZ efficacy analysis had to occur when at least 196 confirmed HZ cases were 
accrued in the modified Total Vaccinated cohort (mTVC) across all age strata (primary condition). It 
was estimated that 196 confirmed HZ cases and a two-sided type I error rate of 5% would provide 
~97% power to demonstrate an overall HZ VE of at least 40% assuming a true HZ VE of 68%. 
The end of study (EOS) analyses of the ZOSTER-006 and the ZOSTER-022 studies were planned after 
the accumulation at least 35 PHN cases in subjects ≥ 70 YOA in the pooled ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-
022. All PHN cases should be accrued in the mTVC.  
Table 6.  Assumptions for incidences under placebo, and VE used for trial simulations 
The cut-off date for end of study analysis had to occur when at least 35 PHN cases in subjects ≥70 
YOA were accrued in the mTVC when pooling the studies ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 (primary 
condition). This number of PHN cases would provide ~90% power to demonstrate PHN VE with Lower 
Limit (LL) above 0%.  
With the confirmatory HZ VE analysis step, it was shown that HZ/su had a VE much higher than 
expected in preventing HZ. Moreover, HZ VE estimates were similar in the three main age strata. 
Given that subjects ≥70 YOA were randomized at the same sites and time in all countries to enrol into 
ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022, it was reasonable to assume that HZ VE would be similar for the 
individuals enrolled in the ZOSTER-022 study. The Applicant thus re-estimated the statistical power of 
the ZOSTER-022 and of the pooled analysis. From these re-evaluations, it was concluded that the 
originally specified targeted numbers of HZ and PHN cases were higher than required to achieve an 
appropriate level of statistical power for the key HZ and PHN endpoints. Considering the statistical 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018

power reached for the key endpoints and in order not to delay the time until subjects in the Placebo 
group could have been offered vaccination with HZ/su under a cross-vaccination protocol, on 16 April 
2015 the Applicant decided to terminate ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 earlier than initially planned. 
The IDMC and consulted regulatory authorities had no objections against this plan. 
Immunogenicity subset 
The number of subjects to be included in each of the immunogenicity subsets was estimated at: 
  2538 subjects in the Immunogenicity subset (humoral immune response) 
  468 subjects in the CMI subset 
The number of placebo subjects and vaccine subjects with blood sampled had to be equal in order to 
maintain the blind. However, only a fraction of the placebo samples were analysed as a reduced 
sample is sufficient to characterise the background gE or VZV-specific immunogenicity levels in the 
placebo group. 
Randomisation 
Studies ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 were conducted in parallel in the same centres. Prior to 
randomized treatment assignment, subjects ≥70 years of age were randomized to the two studies. 
Subjects between ≥50 and <70 were enrolled to study ZOSTER-006 only. 
For each of the two studies, subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive HZ/su or placebo. The 
randomization system used stratification (for region and age cohort within region) and minimization 
algorithms (for country within region and site within country) to determine the treatment to be used 
for the subject. Enrolment was stratified for age groups (8:5:3:1 for 50-59:60-69:70-79:≥80 in study 
ZOSTER-006; 3:1 for 70-79:≥80 in study ZOSTER-022). As soon as the target number of subjects in a 
specific stratification group had been reached, the recruitment was frozen for that age stratum. 
Additionally, random subsets of subjects were selected to be part of the 7-day diary card subset and 
immunogenicity subset (see below). A central randomization system on the internet was used to 
assign subjects. 
Subset allocation 
Subjects were randomly allocated to be part of the Immunogenicity subset. CMI analysis were 
performed in the randomly selected Immunogenicity subset of three countries (Czech Republic, Japan 
and United States) at designated sites that have access to a Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells 
(PBMC) processing facility within the acceptable time window from sample collection to PBMC 
processing. These countries had a target of approximately 156 subjects per country enrolled in the 
immunogenicity subset. Other countries had a target of approximately 138 subjects per country to be 
enrolled in the immunogenicity subset. 
The randomisation methods used for treatment allocation are deemed appropriate. Stratification and 
minimization techniques were used to ensure balance between groups with respect to site and country.  
Blinding (masking) 
This trial was carried out in an observer-blinded way. No reconstitution is required for the NaCl solution 
(placebo), and the reconstituted gE/AS01B study vaccine differs in appearance from the NaCl solution 
placebo. To conduct the study in an observer-blind manner, the gE/AS01B vaccine and NaCl solution 
placebo doses had to be prepared and administered by study staff not involved in the clinical 
evaluation of the subjects. In this way, neither the subject nor the investigator (or other study 
personnel) responsible for the evaluation of any study endpoint would know which treatment was 
administered. 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 62/170 
 
  
Immunological data, which could lead to the unblinding of the treatment groups, was not made 
available during the course of the trial to any investigator or any person involved in the clinical conduct 
of the study. The laboratory in charge of the laboratory testing was blinded to the treatment. 
It was planned to maintain the whole team (Central, Local, Investigators) and subjects blinded up to 
end of study. Overall the blinding was considered appropriate. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis cohorts 
Several analysis sets were used and were defined as follows:  
In both studies there were 5 pre-specified analysis sets:  
• 
• 
• 
the Total Vaccinated Cohort (TVC; all vaccinated subjects with at least one dose, excluding 
subjects from excluded sites); the TVC was used for sensitivity analyses; 
the modified Total Vaccinated Cohort (mTVC; TVC excluding patients having not received 
second dose or who developed a confirmed HZ case prior to 1 month after second dose or who 
wrongly received the vaccination); the mTVC was the primary population for efficacy analysis; 
and three According To Protocol cohorts (ATPc) for analysis of efficacy (supportive), safety and 
immunogenicity. 
Of note, the TVC was analysed according to the vaccine actually administered and included only 
subjects for whom the efficacy endpoint was available. 
All analyses were presented overall and by age stratum. In ZOSTER-006, the main age strata for 
reporting purposes were 50-59, 60-69 and ≥70 YOA. In addition, results were presented separately for 
70-79 and ≥ 80 YOA subjects. Another set of analyses in subjects ≥ 60 YOA was also presented. In 
ZOSTER-022, the main age strata were 70-79 and ≥ 80 YOA. 
In both studies, the number of subjects at risk, person-time, number of confirmed events (HZ), and 
incidence of confirmed HZ cases were tabulated overall and by age stratum separately for each 
treatment group. The results were presented over the whole study and by visit interval. Similar tables 
described the median time-to-event and hazard rate. Survival curves for each vaccine group were 
calculated non-parametrically, tabulated and presented graphically overall and by age stratum using 
the Kaplan-Meier method. 
The two studies ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 were run in parallel. For each study, the primary 
hypothesis (see below) was tested separately on a 5% two-sided significance level. If both were 
successful, the studies were to be pooled. All further analyses in the gate-keeping strategy were based 
on pooled data only. Secondary endpoints for the single studies were thus supportive only and not part 
of the multiplicity control. Hochberg’s step-up procedure was to be used to control the type I error 
within specified test families. This was only applicable for tests that were not part of the primary test 
sequence, i.e., the sequence of hypothesis to be tested in a confirmatory fashion, and hence this is of 
no further consequence. 
The pre-planned null-hypotheses to be tested were 
1.  H0: HZ VE ≤ 25% for all patients in mTVC (primary endpoint ZOSTER-006) 
2.  H0: HZ VE ≤ 10% for all patients in mTVC (primary endpoint ZOSTER-022) 
If 1 and 2 were rejected the following (null-) hypotheses were to be tested in the pooled data set (i.e., 
ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022): 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 63/170 
 
  
3.  H0: PHN VE ≤ 0% for all patients ≥ 70 years of age 
4.  H0: PHN VE ≤ 0% for all patients 
5.  H0: PHN VE ≤ 0% for all patients with confirmed HZ 
6.  H0: HRtime to ceassation of worst pain ≥ 1 for all patients ≥ 70 years of age 
Sensitivity analysis in various age subgroups were conducted for most hypotheses and a re-estimate of 
HZ VE in subjects ≥ 70 years of age was conducted for the pooled data. 
In both studies, two interim analyses for futility were pre-planned. The Applicant did not expect 
stopping for efficacy but reserved a small α = 0.0001 for each interim analysis, which left a 
significance level of 0.0498 for the final analysis (similar to using a significance level of 5% 2-sided). 
Futility rules were to be described in the reporting and analysis plan (RAP). Missing data were not 
imputed for any analysis. Reasons for and timings of missing data were to be reviewed and discussed. 
Patterns for missing data were to be assessed. 
The primary endpoint (HZ vaccine efficacy) was analysed using a Poisson model to compute the 
relative risk (RR) of HZ cases for vaccinated compared to unvaccinated subjects. The model was 
adjusted for the person-time in each vaccine group and stratified for age (only for overall VE) and 
regions. In ZOSTER-006 vaccine efficacy was analysed using the three main age strata as stratification 
levels. VE was then defined as 1 – RR. P-values were presented for a test against zero (i.e., no vaccine 
efficacy), while exact 95% confidence intervals were used to assess clinically meaningful superiority 
over placebo by comparison of the lower limit of the confidence interval to the pre-specified VE (25% 
in ZOSTER-006 and 10% in ZOSTER-022). As sensitivity analysis, a stratified Cox model was 
calculated to estimate vaccine efficacy. 
Overall PHN vaccine efficacy was analysed analogously to HZ vaccine efficacy. The incidence of 
PHN in subjects with an HZ episode, overall and by sub-categories was compared with placebo 
using an asymptotic standardized unconditional binomial test. The analysis was stratified by age group 
and weights associated to each stratum were to be pre-specified (according to the study protocol). In 
the CSR, it is stated that weights associated to each stratum were the proportion of subjects by age 
stratum. Stratified analysis was not possible in case no events occurred in one age stratum. Time-to-
cessation of severe ‘worst’ pain was analysed using a Cox model. It was based on patients with 
confirmed HZ only and (according to the protocol) included any subject reporting ZBPI pain scores of 3 
or more at any time during the study. According to the CSR, patients without pain score above 3 were 
included as censored at time t = 1. Patients with severe “worst” pain (i.e., pain score >3) were 
considered as events with time to event being the inverse of duration of pain (1/t). This allows the 
computation of vaccine efficacy for the reduction of time to worst pain based on the derived hazard 
ratio. 
Subgroup analyses by age group, by region and by time for all hypotheses were provided to assess 
consistency. 
Due to GCP violations one Mexican study site was excluded from all analyses. 
Planned analysis steps 
It was predicted that study ZOSTER-006 would reach the conditions required for triggering final 
efficacy analysis of HZ primary endpoint about one year before those conditions being reached for 
study ZOSTER-022. The analyses of these studies were thus dissociated. The ZOSTER-006 study 
continued after the final HZ efficacy analysis until an adequate number of HZ cases accrued in 
ZOSTER-022 and an adequate number of PHN cases accrued in both ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022. 
Both studies ended concurrently. 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 64/170 
 
  
In study ZOSTER-006, the planned analysis steps were the following: 
Step 1: Final HZ efficacy analysis (i.e. Final analysis of HZ primary endpoint) 
The HZ incidence rate was determined with reference to the first confirmed HZ case observed in the 
patient, should several HZ cases occur in the same subject. The HZ-free period for a subject was 
calculated from HZ onset to time zero relative to the cohort considered:  
 
first vaccination for TVC and  
  beyond the HZ-case exclusion period following the second injection for mTVC and ATP. 
The number of Person-Years at risk over an interval of time is the sum of the confirmed HZ-free 
episodes over all subjects at risk during that interval, either up to the cut-off date for the analysis, the 
censoring date or the occurrence of the first HZ case for a subject. 
Step 2: End of study analysis 
The end of study analysis could not be performed before the final HZ efficacy analysis (step 1). At this 
step, all objectives of study were analysed. Objectives already analysed at step 1 were re-analysed. In 
addition, overall PHN VE in subjects ≥70 YOA, and other pre-specified endpoints were analysed in the 
pooled analyses of studies ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022. 
Different LL values of the 95% CI have been prospectively chosen for deciding whether or not a test 
was significant. In ZOSTER-006 the efficacy of HZ/su against overall HZ was demonstrated if the LL of 
the 95% CI of VE was above 25%. The efficacy in the age strata 50-59, 60-69 was demonstrated if the 
LL of the 95% CI of VE was above 10%. It is considered adequate that this LL value has been set at a 
lower level than the value chosen for the overall analysis. 
The aim of ZOSTER-006 was to show an overall VE significantly larger than 25% (i.e. 95% CI >25%) 
but the study was powered to show a VE ≥ 40%. With an anticipated vaccine efficacy under the null 
hypothesis of 0.25, the power was above 99.9%.  
Rationale for using mTVC for primary analysis  
The mTVC was the primary population for efficacy analysis, which excludes subjects in the TVC for 
efficacy analysis who were not administered with the second vaccination or who develop a confirmed 
case of HZ prior to 1 month after the second vaccination.  
Although the TVC (Intent-to-treat [ITT] population) analysis of efficacy is the one recommended 
according to ICH, the true assessment of the VE, according to the recommended schedule, can only be 
performed based on the mTVC, where subjects not completing the vaccination schedule due to an HZ 
episode or withdrawal will be excluded, as was done in an earlier HZ vaccine efficacy study [Oxman, 
2005]. The analysis on the TVC is planned for sensitivity analyses and is expected to provide 
consistent results with the primary analyses. A delay of 1 month was selected prior to which any 
subject with confirmed HZ would be excluded from mTVC. 
For those reasons, the Applicant believed that the VE estimate for registration purposes should be 
based on mTVC, provided there is no essential VE difference between the mTVC and TVC analyses. The 
proposal was to compare VE analyses on mTVC and TVC, and review the frequency for exclusion from 
mTVC. If the results were consistent between both cohorts then the VE estimate based on mTVC would 
be considered for registration purposes. The study methodology is acceptable.

Results 
Participant flow 
Of note, the flow is referring to the numbers of the Total Vaccinated Cohort as being the number of 
randomized subjects. In fact 16,145 were actually randomised, among whom 15,411 participants 
received at least one vaccination and constituted the TVC.  
The notable deviations from protocol and GCP included: 
•  Mexico – one study site was found significant and systemic deviation from GCP guidelines, 2 
other centers incorrectly applied the informed consent process, involving 671 and 9 subjects, 
respectively. 
•  US - one site was closed after the cut-off date (01 July 2014) decided for final HZ efficacy 
analysis. Thus data from 46 subjects were not endorsed by the principle investigator. 
Up to final HZ efficacy analysis 1,431 subjects were withdrawn: 749 in vaccine group and 682 subjects 
in placebo group. The most common reason was consent withdrawal (not due to an adverse event) and 
SAE, with equal distributions between vaccinated and placebo groups.

In addition to the subjects excluded from the mTVC, 509 (6.6% of the TVC) and 549 subjects (7.1% of 
the TVC) were excluded from the ATP cohort for efficacy, respectively from the HZ/su and the Placebo 
group. The main reasons for exclusion from the ATP were, by order of frequency: administration of any 
medication forbidden by the protocol, randomisation code broken at the investigator site (for most of 
the subjects the unblinding was due to non-compliance with the observer-blind, non-compliance with 
vaccination schedule), administration of vaccine(s) forbidden in the protocol, vaccine temperature 
deviation, protocol violation linked to the inclusion/exclusion criteria including age. 
Recruitment 
The study was carried out by 268 Principal Investigators in 18 countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, 
Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Republic of Korea 
[South Korea], Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, United Kingdom and United States). 
Overall, recruitment targets by region were reached although slightly lower recruitment than expected 
was observed in Latin America and Australasia.  
Concerning the numbers of subjects by region for the mTVC at the EOS analysis step, the proportion of 
subjects from Latin America is much lower than expected, reflecting lower recruitment rate and the 
exclusion of subjects with protocol violation. Most study participants (approximately 50%) were 
enrolled in Europe, as planned by the Applicant in the study protocol.  
Conduct of the study 
The first subject was enrolled on 02 August 2010 and the study was completed on 27 July 2015 (last 
study visit/contact of the last subject). The cut-off dates (data lock) for the final HZ efficacy analysis 
and for the end of study (EOS) efficacy analysis were respectively 01 July 2014 and 21 April 2015.  
Final HZ VE analysis was performed on blinded HZ data in adults ≥50 YOA when the prespecified 
number of HZ cases was reached. All suspected HZ episodes with onset before 1 July 2014, i.e. the 
data lock point for final HZ efficacy analysis, were included.  
Overall, 74 and 335 subjects had at least one suspected episode of HZ respectively in the HZ/su and in 
the Placebo groups (mTVC - EOS). There were 84 and 340 episodes occurring in the subjects in the 
respective groups. Of the suspected episodes, 76% in the HZ/su group and 77% in the Placebo group 
had adequate samples and could be properly ascertained based on PCR. The rest of the subjects had 
inadequate samples (13% and 12%) or had no sample taken (11% and 11%). 
The HZAC was not able to decide for large proportion of the episodes with no (adequate) sample (i.e. 
respectively, 10/20 and 22/79 in the HZ/su and the Placebo groups). Overall, this led to 88% and 94% 
of the suspected HZ events that could be ascertained (HZ confirmed or ruled out) either by PCR or by 
HZAC. The remaining suspected episodes could not be confirmed/ruled out. PCR and HZAC results 
were overall consistent for most of the episodes (amongst episodes with results available with both 
methods, respectively 55/60 and 207/232 had results which were in agreement in the HZ/su and the 
Placebo groups). 
The Applicant described a major issue at a Mexican site (GCP violations) which lead to the elimination 
of data from all subjects at one site from all analyses. Issues at this site in addition to a few major 
protocol violations at other sites lead to the elimination of a substantial proportion (overall 5% of the 
randomised subjects eliminated from the TVC) of the randomised subjects from all analyses. Based on 
the available information, the Applicant’s study oversight, management and decisions with regards 
compliance issues are deemed appropriate. The potential impact on study findings is likely to be 
limited given the randomisation methods and the fact that groups are balanced for exclusions.

With the exception of the issue described by the Applicant for the Mexican site (major protocol 
deviation), and given the information provided in the CSR, the study conduct raises no concern. 
Baseline data 
Overall and in mTVC, demographic characteristics were similar in 2 study groups ad within main age 
strata. The mean age at enrolment was 62.3 years, with a distribution of 47.3%, 29.1%, and 23.6% of 
participants at 50 - 59 YOA, 60 - 69 YOA, and ≥70 YOA, respectively. Most participants were female 
(61.2%) and white (71.8%), and were enrolled from Europe (51.6%). Results are similar for the TVC 
as well as in the EOS cohorts. The number of subjects in the age strata is consistent with the age 
stratification ratios (8:5:4). Age distribution was comparable across regions. 
Women were overrepresented in the trial. Female gender has been described as a risk factor of HZ in 
the literature. However, study groups are well balanced with regards to baseline demographics, 
including within age strata, so that this is not expected to affect the validity of study findings.  
Study groups were also well balanced with respect to pre-existing immunity to VZV. Nearly all subjects 
(99%) in the HZ/su and Placebo groups were seropositive for anti-gE antibodies pre-vaccination. Pre-
vaccination GMCs of anti-gE Ab were comparable between groups. Pre-vaccination GMCs of anti-gE Ab 
were 1247.1 (95% CI: 1174.8 - 1323.8) mIU/mL, and 1311.9 (95% CI: 1234.8– 1393.9) mIU/mL, for 
the HZ/su group and Placebo group, respectively. Groups were well balanced at baseline with respect 
to CMI read-outs.  
Groups are balanced for main comorbidities at baseline (medical history) such as diabetes. 
Numbers analysed  
For the Final analysis of HZ vaccine efficacy, from the 16,160 subjects enrolled, 8068 were randomized 
to the HZ/su group and 8077 to the Placebo group (15 subjects were not assigned to any group). From 
the 16,145 randomised subjects, 9 subjects were not vaccinated. Therefore, the number of subjects 
actually vaccinated is 16,136 (8061 in the HZ/su group and 8075 in the Placebo group). 
From the 16,136 subjects actually vaccinated, 363 subjects from the HZ/su group and 362 subjects 
from the Placebo group were excluded from all statistical analyses. As such, the Total Vaccinated 
Cohort used for the Final analysis corresponds to 15,411 subjects (7698 in the HZ/su group and 7713 
in the Placebo group). Of these 14,759 (95.8%) were included in the modified TVC (mTVC).

1.  Efficacy against HZ 
The primary analysis of HZ VE occurred at step 1 (final HZ efficacy analysis step). Results regarding HZ 
VE by age stratum and overall (using the Poisson method) are presented for the mTVC. A descriptive 
analysis (re-estimation) of HZ VE was performed at EOS analysis. A supportive analysis was also 
performed on the TVC and the ATP cohort for efficacy. 
All suspected HZ episodes with onset date up to and including the cut-off dates for step 1 and step 2 
analysis were considered for the respective analysis. 
Final HZ efficacy analysis overall and by age stratum (step 1) 
Only very few confirmed HZ episodes occurred in the vaccinated subjects (6 in the HZ/su group in 
comparison with 210 in the Placebo group) (Table 10 below). No subject reported more than one 
confirmed HZ episode. Of the 216 confirmed HZ cases, the majority (89%) was PCR-confirmed and 
11% were classified by the HZ Ascertainment Committee (HZAC). 
The mean (SD) follow-up time was 3.1 (0.5) years. The median (min - max) follow-up time was 3.1 (0 
- 3.7) years. The mean follow up time did not substantially differ between groups. 
Overall VE against HZ was 97.16% (95%CI: 93.72%-98.97%) in subjects ≥50 YOA. The primary 
objective of study ZOSTER-006 regarding HZ VE in subjects ≥50 YOA was met as the lower limit of the 
95% CI of the VE against HZ was largely above 25%. VE did not vary substantially with age.

End of study analysis overall and by age stratum (step 2) 
Compared to the final HZ efficacy analysis step, HZ episodes were reported for 47 additional subjects. 
In total over the study, 9 occurred in the HZ/su group and 254 in the Placebo group. No subject had 
more than one confirmed HZ episode during the study period. The mean (SD) follow-up time was 3.9 
(0.7) years. The median (min - max) follow-up time was 4.1 (0 - 4.5) years. Table 11 shows that 
findings are similar in the EOS analysis, with an overall VE against HZ of 96.50% (95%CI: 93.25%-
98.46%) in subjects ≥50 YOA. 
Table 10.  First or only episode of HZ during the entire study period by age strata and overall using 
Poisson method (mTVC - EOS analysis) 
HZ incidence rates 
Overall, incidence rate of HZ was 9.1 per 1000 person-years in the placebo group and 0.3 person-
years in the HZ/su group in the final HZ efficacy analysis (see table below together with the efficacy 
data against HZ). Similar results were obtained in the EOS analysis (0.3 vs. 8.9 per 1000 person-years 
overall). In the placebo group incidence rates of HZ tended to increase very slightly with age. In 
particular, the incidence rate tended to be slightly higher in subjects ≥60 YOA in comparison with 
those 50-59 YOA (10.2 vs. 7.8 per 1000 person-years).

*Over a median follow-up period of 3.1 years 
In the placebo group, there were trends for slightly higher incidence in females as compared to males 
(9.6 vs. 7.9 per 1000 person-years), and for variation across regions (from 7.1 in Europe to 12.3 in 
Australasia, 10.4 in Latin America and 9.6 in North America). However these variations are very small 
and no statistical tests were performed on the differences. 
Sensitivity analyses 
No substantial differences by gender or by region were observed for vaccine efficacy (VE) against HZ 
using the Poisson method.   
HZ VE (first or only episode of HZ) during the entire study period by age stratum and overall 
determined using the Cox Regression method was similar to HZ VE determined in the primary analysis 
using the Poisson method.  
HZ VE by time 
VE by year following vaccine administration is presented in table 12. VE is maintained at high levels 
over 4 years. This is confirmed by cumulative VE estimations. The overall HZ VE was 98.38% (95% CI: 
90.64% - 99.96%) up to Year 1, 96.16% (95% CI: 90.81% - 98.77%) up to Year 2, 97.49% (95% CI: 
94.05% - 99.17%) up to Year 3, and 96.50% (95% CI: 93.25% - 98.46%) up to Year 4. Analyses 
show consistent findings across age strata.

VE after one dose only 
Overall HZ VE after one dose only was analysed in subjects above 50 years of age who developed HZ 
between dose 1 and dose 2. The overall HZ VE was 90.79% (95% CI: 62.07% - 98.96%) with a mean 
follow up of ~76 days. This finding is based on only 2 events in the HZ/su group and 20 events in the 
Placebo group. As stated by the Applicant, these results thus need to be interpreted with caution. 
2.  Efficacy against PHN 
PHN efficacy analysis (EOS) overall and by age stratum 
Cumulatively 18 cases of PHN were reported in the Placebo group, vs. none in the vaccinated group. 
Overall VE against PHN was 100.00% (95% CI: 77.11-100.00). Although the study was not powered 
for this, PHN VE was demonstrated, as the overall PHN VE was 100% with LL > 0 and p-value 
<0.0001.  
VE did not appear to vary across age categories, but confidence intervals are very large within age 
strata. In the Placebo group, 8 cases occurred in the 50-59 YOA stratum and 10 cases in the ≥60 YOA 
group, of which 2 cases were in the 60-69 YOA stratum. Note that ZOSTER-006 was not powered for 
analysis of PHN VE by age strata, but as a result of the 100% VE against PHN reached in each age 
stratum, the LL of the 95% CI was also above 0% in the 50-59 YOA and ≥60 YOA strata. However, 
due to the low number of cases in the Placebo group in the 60-69 YOA stratum, PHN VE was not 
significant in this age stratum (LL of the 95% CI <0%). Efficacy against PHN by age category should 
be examined in the pooled analysis. The main analysis of PHN VE (primary objective in subjects ≥70 
YOA) was performed on pooled data from ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 studies.  
The incidence rate of subjects reporting at least one PHN episode per 1000 person-years was 0.0 in the 
HZ/su group and 0.6 in the Placebo group. PHN incidence increased with age (about twofold increased 
risk for individuals ≥70 YOA as compared to individuals <70 YOA).

3.  Duration of severe ‘worst’ HZ-associated pain over the entire pain period 
Findings with respect to the duration of severe ‘worst’ HZ associated pain over the entire pain 
reporting period (mTVC - EOS analysis) are described below. 
The number of subjects who had at least one day of severe ‘worst’ HZ-associated pain was: 
 
 
In the HZ/su group, 7 of the 9 subjects with confirmed HZ episode. 
In the Placebo group, 221 of the 254 subjects with confirmed HZ episode. 
Overall, the median (min - max) duration of severe ‘worst’ HZ-associated pain was: 
  11 days (3 - 78) days in the HZ/su group. 
  15 days (1 - 464) days in the Placebo group. 
The overall VE in terms of reduction of duration of ‘worst’ HZ-associated pain was 26.87% (95% CI: -
59.56% - 66.48%; p-value = 0.4318). Results were consistent in the TVC cohort. Although not 
statistically significant due to a low number of cases, these results show a trend in favour of the 
vaccine group. 
4.  Confirmed HZ episode-related mortality and hospitalizations, HZ-related 
complications (other than PHN) 
Overall and in all age strata, no HZ-related mortality and no HZ-related hospitalization was reported 
(mTVC and TVC). 
The number of subjects who reported HZ related complications (other than PHN) during the entire 
study period were as follows: 
In the mTVC – EOS analysis: 
 
 
In the HZ/su group, 0 of the 9 subjects with confirmed HZ episode. 
In the Placebo group, 6 (2%) of the 254 subjects with confirmed HZ episode. 
In the TVC – EOS analysis: 
 
 
In the HZ/su group, 0 of the 12 subjects with confirmed HZ episode. 
In the Placebo group, 8 (3%) of the 280 subjects with confirmed HZ episode. 
The complications described in the Placebo group are as follows: 
  HZ vasculitis (n=1) 
  Ophthalmic disease (n=1) 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 75/170 
 
  
  Neurologic disease (n=1) 
  Disseminated disease (n=5) 
Events fully recovered except one, the case of neurologic disease, which left sequelae. No conclusion 
can be drawn due to a low number of cases. 
5.  Use of pain medications  
Overall, the use of HZ-associated pain medications was reported for 6 subjects in the HZ/su group out 
of 9 subjects with a confirmed HZ episode (67%), with a total of 13 occurrence of use. In the Placebo 
group, the use of HZ associated pain medication was reported for 190 subjects out of 254 subjects 
with a confirmed HZ episode (75%), with a total of 529 occurrence of use.  
Overall, the median duration (min - max) of HZ-associated pain medication was 21.0 (8.0-63.0) days 
in the HZ/su group, and 22.0 (1.0-1266.0) days in the Placebo group. The median time to resolution of 
clinically-significant pain was 14.0 days in vaccine group and 17.0 days in placebo.  
Results were consistent in the TVC. Although not statistically significant due to a low number of cases, 
these results show a trend in favour of the vaccine group.  
6.  PHN incidence in subjects with a confirmed HZ episode 
Due to the high VE against HZ, resulting in a low number of HZ confirmed cases in the HZ/su group, it 
was not possible to conclude on VE in terms of reduction of PHN risk in subjects with confirmed HZ (p-
value = 1.0). Overall, no PHN episode was reported in any of the subjects with a confirmed HZ episode 
in the HZ/su group (9 in the mTVC and 12 in the TVC cohorts). The overall risk of PHN in case of HZ 
episode was 7.1% in the Placebo group (18/254 in the mTVC). Results were similar in the TVC: 7.5% 
(21/280).  
7.  Analysis of quality of life using the ZBPI questionnaire 
ZBPI score (mTVC HZ confirmed cases - HZ ZBPI evaluable subgroup) 
For different parameters evaluated based on the ZBPI questionnaire, a trend towards higher QoL in the 
vaccine group compared to the Placebo group was observed in subjects with a confirmed HZ episode. 
Analyses were carried out in the mTVC HZ ZBPI evaluable subgroup who had a first ZBPI evaluation 
visit within 14 days of the first date of rash. 
The mean (SD) ‘ZBPI worst pain score’ was: 5.5 (2.73) in the HZ/su vaccine group, and 6.7 (2.94) in 
the Placebo Group, with a p-value = 0.1133. 
The mean (SD) ‘ZBPI average pain score’ observed over time was: 3.9 (1.89) in the HZ/su group, and 
5.5 (2.74) in the Placebo group, with a p-value = 0.0486 (i.e. statistically significant difference), with 
lower scores in the HZ/su group. 
The mean (SD) ‘Activities of Daily Living’ score was: 3.3 (2.98) in the HZ/su vaccine group, and 4.3 
(3.13) in the Placebo Group, with a p-value = 0.3817. 
Area under the curve analysis 
The analysis of the AUC for worst pain score, AUC for average pain score, and AUC for ADL score 
showed no statistically significant difference between the HZ/su group and the Placebo group. 
However, all mean scores at all time points (30, 90 and 182 days) were lower in the HZ/su group than 
in the Placebo group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 76/170 
 
  
BOI scores 
The burden-of-illness (BOI) score incorporates the incidence of HZ with the severity and duration of 
acute and chronic HZ-related pain over a 6 month period following rash onset.  
Overall, the mean (SD) AUC severity-of-illness score and mean AUC severity-of-interference score 
evaluated by ZBPI in the mTVC were significantly lower in the HZ/su group compared to the Placebo 
group overall and in all age strata, according to the Chop-lump test (p-value < 0.0001). 
Over a 26-week period from zoster rash onset, the overall VE estimate against burden-of-illness score 
(BOI) caused by HZ was 98.4% (95% CI: 92.2%-100.0%) with consistent point estimates in all age 
strata.  
The overall VE estimated against burden-of-interference measured on ADL score in the mTVC was 
99.1% (95% CI: 86.2% - 100.0%) with consistent point estimates in all age strata. 
Interference of HZ with QoL (EQ-5D and SF-36) 
Over time, the mean (SD) ‘SF-36 role physical’ (RP) worst score (p-value = 0.0449) and the ‘SF-36 
bodily pain’ (BP) worst score (p-value = 0.0338) were significantly different between the HZ/su group 
[RP = 69.44 (19.63), BP = 55.33 (16.85)] compared with the Placebo group [RP = 49.55 (31.45), BP 
= 39.97 (24.59)], suggesting higher (better) mean scores in the HZ/su group. No other statistically 
significant difference was observed between vaccine groups in the worst score for any other SF-36 
scale scores. No statistically significant difference in the estimated EQ-5D utility score or EQ-5D VAS 
was observed between the HZ/su group and the Placebo group over time. 
8.  Humoral immunogenicity results 
Humoral immune responses were analysed in the Immunogenicity subset (ATP cohort). Immune 
responses were assessed at Month 3 (one month post-dose 2) compared to Month 0 (pre-vaccination). 
Persistence of the immune responses was assessed at Months 14, 26 and 38 (one, two and three years 
post-dose 2). The anti-gE ELISA Ab results (all timepoints) are presented in the CSR. Data regarding 
the analysis of anti-VZV ELISA Ab have been submitted and evaluated during the procedure (see 
pharmacology section). Anti-VZV neutralizing Ab titres (at all timepoints) were not measured in this 
study, since the correlation between anti-VZV as well as anti-gE concentrations and anti-VZV 
neutralizing Ab titres has been explored in ZOSTER-010 showing a good correlation of anti-VZV 
neutralizing Ab titres with both ELISA assays (anti-gE and anti-VZV ELISA). As a consequence, anti-
VZV neutralization assay has not been performed in more recent ZOSTER studies, including ZOSTER-
006, as it would not provide substantial new insights into the immune response to vaccination nor 
would it change the conclusions of the study.  
Very high levels of anti-gE Ab were reached in the HZ/su group at Month 3 (Median 53,375 mIU/mL) 
as compared to the baseline level (Median 1283 mIU/mL) and placebo level (Median 1292.2 mIU/mL). 
The majority of subjects (i.e. >98%) in the HZ/su and Placebo groups were seropositive for anti-gE 
antibodies pre-vaccination and all subsequent time-points (Months 0, 3, 14, 26 and 38). In the HZ/su 
group, post-vaccination GMCs of anti-gE Ab peaked at Month 3, than decreased one Year post-dose 2 
but remained higher than the baseline level up to 3 years post dose 2 (see below table).

Table 14.  Seropositivity rates and Geometric Mean Concentrations (GMCs) of anti-gE antibody at 
Month 0, 3, 14, 26 and 38 (Adapted ATP cohort for immunogenicity-Humoral)  
The Mean Geometric Increase (MGI) of anti-gE Ab concentrations over pre-vaccination was 42.0 (95% 
CI: 39.3 - 44.8) at Months 3. GMCs of anti-gE Ab remained higher than at baseline up to Month 38 
with MGI of 9.7 (95% CI: 9.1 - 10.4) at Month 38. In the Placebo group, GMCs remained at pre-
vaccination levels at all time-points. The MGI over pre-vaccination was not higher than 1.0 at any 
time-point. 
Anti-gE response to vaccine (Vaccine response rate [VRR]) was defined as follows: for subjects who 
were seropositive at baseline, a 4-fold increase in the anti-gE Ab concentration as compared to the 
pre-vaccination anti-gE Ab concentration; for subjects who were seronegative at baseline: a 4-fold 
increase in the anti-gE Ab concentration as compared to the anti-gE Ab cut-off value for seropositivity. 
In the HZ/su group, the VRRs for anti-gE Ab concentrations was 98.5% (95% CI: 97.6%-99.1%) and 
80.9% (95% CI: 78.2%-83.3%) at Months 3 and 38, respectively.

and 38 (Adapted ATP cohort for immunogenicity-Humoral) 
GMCs of anti-gE antibody were similar across age categories. Based on MGIs, immunogenicity very 
slightly decreased with age. In the HZ/su group, the MGI over pre-vaccination was 48.4 (95% CI: 43.1 
- 54.5), 42.9 (95% CI: 38.5 - 47.8) and 35.6 (95% CI: 31.6 - 40.0) at Month 3 respectively in the 50-
59 YOA stratum, the 60-69 YOA stratum, and the ≥70 YOA stratum. Reverse cumulative curves 
indicate that anti-gE responses were very similar across age strata. 
VRR at Month 3 were also consistent across age strata 99.2% (95%CI: 97.6%-99.8%) in the 50-59 
YOA, 98.9% (95%CI: 97.2%-99.7%) in the 60-69 YOA and 97.5% (95%CI: 95.2-98.8) in the ≥70 
YOA. However, VRR at Month 38 slightly decreased with age 87.3% (95%CI: 83.2-90.8) in the 50-59 
YOA, 80.1% (95%CI: 75.3%-84.3%) in the 60-69 YOA and 75.2% (95%CI: 70.0%-79.9%) in the ≥70 
YOA. 
Anti-gE responses did not substantially vary across regions. 
Inferential analysis on the log-transformed anti-gE Ab concentrations (Month 3) was performed by 
using a simple Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model. The fixed-effect model included the treatment 
and age strata as fixed effect. The pre-vaccination log-transformed Ab concentrations (Month 0) were 
included as continuous covariate. Least-squares means and 95% CI were back-transformed to provide 
geometric means and ratios. Geometric means (GMs) of post-vaccination Ab concentrations were 
calculated for Month 3 conditionally to the means of the log-transformed concentrations at pre-
vaccination calculated across the treatment groups. The difference of means between vaccine and 
placebo was calculated together with 95% CIs (2-sided) and back-transformed to the original units to 
provide GMCs and GM ratios. Results from this exploratory group comparison showed a higher 
adjusted GM anti-gE Ab concentration in the HZ/su group compared to the Placebo group: the adjusted 
GM ratio (HZ/su group/Placebo group) was 44.31 (95% CI: 41.68 – 47.09; p-value <0.0001).

9.  CMI results (exploratory objective) 
CD4+ T cells are believed to play a central role in preventing VZV reactivation and CD4+ T cells are 
deemed to decrease with age. gE-specific CMI overall (subjects ≥50 YOA) at Months 3, 14, 26 and 38 
was assessed in a descriptive manner. The gE-specific CD4 showed a pattern similar to the anti-gE ab 
(peak one month post dose 2, persistence above baseline level 3 years post dose 2). CMI baseline 
levels and CMI responses were essentially similar across age strata, although there was a slight 
decrease in the CMI response rate with age. 
CMI responses were evaluated in a fraction of the immunogenicity subset in ZOSTER-006, i.e. 430 
subjects of which 212 were in the HZ/su group. 
gE- and VZV-specific CD4[2+] T cell responses were evaluated up to Month 38 post Dose 1 in ZOSTER-
006. One month post Dose-2, there was a 24.6-fold increase above pre-vaccination level in the median 
frequencies of gE/specific CD4[2+] T cells observed in ATP subjects ≥ 50 YOA. VZV-specific CD4[2+] T 
responses were also augmented, although to a lesser extent. No apparent age effect was observed for 
this analysis on very limited number of subjects.

Study title: A phase III, randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, clinical 
vaccination trial to assess the prophylactic efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of gE/AS01B vaccine 
when administered intramuscularly on a 0, 2-month schedule in adults aged 70 years and older.  
The study was conducted concurrently with ZOSTER-006 according to a similar study design and in the 
same countries and centres. Prior to treatment allocation, subjects 70-79 YOA and ≥80 YOA were 
randomized to either study ZOSTER-006 or ZOSTER-022. This procedure allowed the pooled analysis of 
two studies to be powered to demonstrate statistically significant PHN VE in subjects ≥ 70 YOA, and 
further to provide consolidated estimation of clinically meaningful HZ VE in this age group. 
A total of 14,816 subjects were enrolled and randomized to HZ/su or placebo according to a 1:1 ratio 
(vaccine: placebo). Subjects were stratified by age (70-79 YOA and ≥80 YOA) in approximately a 3:1 
ratio. The 70-79 YOA and ≥80 YOA strata were combined for the primary ≥70 YOA overall analyses 
and pooled with ZOSTER-006 data for the pooled analysis. 
The anti-VZV ELISA data and the Correlate of protection analysis were conducted on ZOSTER-006 and 
ZOSTER-022 pooled data. 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 81/170 
 
  
 
 
Methods 
The study started and was conducted simultaneously at the same study sites as study ZOSTER-006, 
and applied a similar methodology (See ZOSTER-006).  
It was predicted that study ZOSTER-006 would have reached the conditions required for triggering 
final analysis of HZ primary endpoint about one year before those conditions being reached for study 
ZOSTER-022. Therefore the Applicant decided, as originally planned in these circumstances, to 
dissociate the two studies in terms of timing of the analysis of each study. Moreover, a two step 
approach is allowed for the analysis of each study. Both studies were to end concurrently. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of ZOSTER-022 (same as ZOSTER-006) was to evaluate overall VE in reducing 
the risk of HZ, as compared with placebo, in adults ≥70 YOA.  
Secondary objectives related to efficacy evaluation in ZOSTER-022: to assess VE against PHN and 
against HZ-related mortality and hospitalizations in subjects ≥70 YOA; VE in the ≥70 YOA subjects of a 
confirmed HZ episode, with respect to reducing total duration of severe “worst” HZ-associated pain 
over the entire pain reporting period, HZ-associated complications, and use of pain medications for HZ.  
Exploratory objectives of ZOSTER-022 (same as the pooled analysis): to evaluate VE in mitigation of 
BOI caused by HZ compared to placebo in subjects ≥70 YOA; VE in ≥70 YOA subjects of a confirmed 
HZ episode, with respect to reducing severity of acute HZ-associated pain and improving QoL; to 
evaluate vaccine-induced humoral immune responses up to Month 38 post Dose 1 in a subset of 
subjects, and to assess correlation of the humoral immune responses at Month 3 with protection 
against HZ.  
Endpoints 
Primary, secondary and exploratory endpoints are the same as for study ZOSTER-006 except for the 
cell-mediated immunity (CMI) which was only evaluated for ZOSTER-006. 
Sample size 
The final HZ efficacy analysis of the ZOSTER-022 study was planned after the accumulation of at least 
278 confirmed HZ cases across all age strata. This number of HZ cases would provide ~99% power to 
demonstrate HZ VE of at least 10% assuming a HZ VE of 53% with a two-sided type I error rate of 
5%. With a follow up time of ~3 years and stratification ratio for age of 3:1 (70-79:≥80) and drop-out 
and non-compliance rates as for ZOSTER-006, this leads to a total sample size of 14,512 subjects. 
The end of study (EOS) analyses of the ZOSTER-022 study (like the ZOSTER-006) was planned after 
the accumulation at least 35 PHN cases in subjects ≥ 70 YOA in the pooled ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-
022. All PHN cases should be accrued in the mTVC (modified total vaccinated cohort). 
Planning of ZOSTER-022 was in line with the success criterion, i.e. the goal to show a VE significantly 
larger than 10%.  
For other aspect of the study refer to section 2.5.2.1 on ZOSTER-006 Methods. 
Statistical methods 
See ZOSTER-006. 
Changes were introduced by protocol amendment 4 (dated 18 April 2014) for ZOSTER-022 and the 
pooled analyses. The two studies were dissociated for timing of analysis of each study and were to end 
concurrently. A 2-step approach was defined to allow for analysis of each study: step 1, the final HZ

efficacy analysis, and step 2, the EOS analysis. The conditions determining the cut-off dates of the 2 
analysis steps were detailed. 
In ZOSTER-022, PHN in subjects ≥70 YOA was demoted from co-primary endpoint to a descriptive 
secondary endpoint. The co-primary endpoint of PHN in subjects ≥70 YOA in pooled ZOSTER-006 and 
ZOSTER-022 was to be considered as the primary PHN analysis. The overall PHN in subjects ≥50 YOA 
(ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 pooled) originally planned became a secondary endpoint. The 
objectives and endpoints as well as gatekeeping strategy was updated accordingly. Pooled analyses of 
2 studies were only to be conducted if the primary objective was demonstrated in both studies 
separately. The targeted total number of PHN cases required to trigger the pooled PHN analysis was 
reduced from previous 88 PHN cases to at least 35 PHN cases in subjects ≥70 YOA in the mTVC, while 
maintaining statistical robustness. 
The cut-off of the anti-gE ELISA assay was changed from 18 to 97 mIU/mL due to background signal 
measured with samples from VZV naïve children. 
Other changes 
Subsequent to availability of the ZOSTER-006 final HZ VE results, ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 
studies were terminated earlier than initially planned. The applicable cut-off date used for ZOSTER-022 
(and ZOSTER-006) EOS efficacy analysis was 21 April 2015. 
A suspected case of HZ, if falling into the categories “not HZ” and “no possible classification” based on 
the final HZAC assignment and the case could not be confirmed or excluded by PCR, would be 
considered as “not HZ” for analysis. 
Testing of anti-VZV neutralizing Ab was not performed for ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 (see section 
2.4.3). 
Rationale for using mTVC for primary analysis  
See ZOSTER-006. 
Results 
Study population 
The mTVC was the primary population for the efficacy analysis, which excluded subjects in the TVC for 
analysis of efficacy who were not given the second vaccination or who developed a confirmed case of 
HZ prior to 1 month after the second vaccination.  
A total of 13,900 and 13,163 subjects were part of the TVC and mTVC, respectively. The mean age of 
participants at enrolment in the mTVC was 75.5 YOA (range: 62-96 YOA); 45.3% of the subjects were 
male and 54.7% female. The population was predominantly of White - Caucasian / European Heritage 
(77.0%) with 12.7% being of Asian – East Asian Heritage. The demographic characteristics of the TVC 
were similar to the mTVC.  
The immunogenicity analyses were performed on a subset of subjects. A total of 799 subjects were 
part of the ATP cohort for immunogenicity. The mean age was 75.8 YOA (range: 70 to 92 YOA); 43.8% 
of the subjects were male and 56.2% female. The population was predominantly of White - Caucasian 
/European Heritage (69.0%) with 15.6% being of Asian - East Asian Heritage. 
Individuals with certain comorbidities were included in the pivotal trials, which is acceptable for a 
general elderly population.

Efficacy results 
Primary objective: HZ Vaccine Efficacy (mTVC) 
The HZ VE analysis was performed on cases with a DLP of 12 October 2015. The median follow-up 
period was 3.9 years (range: 0 to 4.5 years) and the mean (SD) follow-up period was 3.7 (0.8) years. 
Overall, VE against HZ in adults ≥70 YOA was 89.79% (95% CI: 84.29% to 93.66%; p<0.0001), with 
23 confirmed HZ cases in the HZ/su group and 223 in the Placebo group. Therefore, the primary 
objective of study ZOSTER-022 was met (LL of the 95% CI > 10%). 
No age effect was observed when comparing the two age strata (HZ VE 90.02% [95% CI: 83.54% to 
94.32%; p <0.0001] in the 70-79 YOA strata and HZ VE 89.08% [95% CI: 74.65% to 96.16%; p 
<0.0001] in the ≥80 YOA strata). 
HZ VE during the 4th year remained high at 85.07 % (95 % CI: 64.47 – 94.83%; P<0.0001) in ≥70 
YOA. 
Secondary objectives: VE in the prevention of overall PHN (mTVC) 
Although the study was not powered for this, PHN VE was demonstrated in adults ≥70 YOA [VE of 
85.49% (95% CI: 58.52% to 96.30%; p <0.0001)], with 4 confirmed PHN episodes in the HZ/su 
group and 28 in the Placebo group. PHN VE was also demonstrated in the 70-79 YOA stratum (90.80% 
[95% CI: 62.57% - 98.95%]; p<0.0001). PHN VE could not be demonstrated in the ≥80 YOA stratum, 
which is likely due to the lower number of subjects reporting PHN episodes in the ≥80 YOA Placebo 
group. 
Table 20.  First or only episode of PHN during the entire study period by age stratum and overall 
using Poisson method (modified Total Vaccinated Cohort-ZOSTER-022) 
Other secondary objectives (mTVC) 
Despite the low number of HZ confirmed cases in the HZ/su group, the secondary objective regarding 
overall VE in terms of reduction of use of pain medication associated with HZ in subjects ≥70 YOA 
was met. The overall VE in terms of reduction of use of pain medication associated with HZ during the 
entire study period was 39.60% (95% CI: 10.79; 64.75; p=0.0083) among participants who were ≥70 
YOA, with 43.5% of subjects in the HZ/su group and 71.8% of subjects in the Placebo group having 
taken at least one pain medication for HZ. The vaccine significantly reduced the duration of HZ-
associated pain medication with VE of 49.25% (95% CI: 2.92; 73.47). The median duration of pain 
medication use was 30 and 38 days in the vaccine and placebo groups respectively. 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 84/170 
 
  
 
 
Other secondary objectives (VE in reducing the duration of severe ‘worst’ HZ-associated pain, reducing 
HZ-related mortality and hospitalizations and reducing the incidence of HZ-related complications [other 
than PHN]), were evaluated in subjects with confirmed HZ. Due to the high HZ VE, resulting in a low 
number of HZ confirmed cases in the HZ/su group, it was not possible due to lack of statistical power 
to conclude on objectives evaluating the VE in reducing the duration of severe ‘worst’ HZ-associated 
pain and the incidence of HZ-associated complications [other than PHN]. However, when considering 
the descriptive statistics of the median duration of severe worst HZ-associated pain in number of days, 
there was a trend for a shorter duration in the HZ/su group vs. Placebo group, i.e. 13.5 vs. 19.0 days 
in ≥70 YOA in ZOSTER-022. 
It was not possible to conclude on the objective evaluating the VE in reducing HZ-related mortality and 
hospitalizations due to the low number of reported events. In this study, no subjects died due to HZ or 
HZ-related complications. In the HZ/su group, none of the subjects were hospitalized due to HZ, 
whereas in the Placebo group 5 subjects were hospitalized for HZ. 
Pre-specified sensitivity analyses indicated that VE against HZ by region and by gender were generally 
consistent with the overall VE against HZ with VE estimates by region and by gender within the 95% 
CI of the overall VE. 
QoL exploratory objectives 
In subjects ≥70 YOA, the main average pain score and the mean worst pain score by ZBPI were not 
significantly lower in the HZ/su group compared to the Placebo group, i.e. 4.6 vs. 5.5 (p=0.1248) and 
5.8 vs. 6.9 (p=0.0847), respectively. ZBPI severity of illness, burden of illness (BOI), severity of 
interference, and burden of interference mean area under the curve (AUC) scores in the mTVC were 
lower in the HZ/su group compared to the Placebo group, overall as well as by age strata. 
Overall the different parameters evaluated for the QoL exploratory objectives trended towards a lower 
loss of QoL in subjects with confirmed HZ in the HZ/su group compared to the Placebo group.  
Immunogenicity exploratory objectives 
The results overall and in both age strata (70-79 YOA and ≥80 YOA) showed strong anti-gE Ab 
responses following 2 doses of HZ/su at 1 month post Dose 2 (Month 3 [32.8-fold above pre-
vaccination levels]). After the peak immune response at 1 month post Dose 2, the observed anti-gE Ab 
responses were lower 1 year post Dose 2 (Month 14) but persisted well above pre-vaccination levels 
up to 3 years post Dose 2 (Month 38 [6.50- fold above pre-vaccination levels]). 
The anti-gE Ab responses by age strata and by region were consistent with the overall analysis.

on 01 July 2014 and was defined when the following conditions were met: 
- 
- 
- 
at  least  196  confirmed  HZ 
cases were accrued in the mTVC; 
60  HZ 
cases  in  subjects  50-59  YOA  and  approximately  60  HZ  cases  in

Notes 
The primary objective regarding HZ VE in subjects ≥ 50 YOA was met as 
the LL of the 95% CI of the VE against HZ was above 25%. 
The  primary  analysis  method  of  the  VE  considered  the  exact  inference  on 
the relative risk stratified for age strata and regions conditionally to the total 
number of HZ cases observed and time at risk.  
All p-values reported were related to the null hypothesis test VE = 0 (The p-
value  for  primary  HZ  VE  endpoint  was  according  to  the  statistical  analysis 
plan to be related to the null hypothesis test VE≤25%). 
The primary analysis was supported by sensitivity analyses of the HZ VE 
in  the  50-59  YOA  and  60-69  YOA  age  strata,  and  confirmed  by  the  EOS 
analysis.

Time point description 
The  cut-off  date  for  ZOSTER-006  End-of-protocol  analysis  was  determined 
per protocol, when all conditions were also met for final HZ efficacy analysis 
in  study  ZOSTER-022.  This  was  the  case  in  study  ZOSTER-022,  as  also 
approximately  75%  of  subjects  in  each  stratum  had  completed  at  least  36 
months follow-up after dose 2, and the remaining subjects had completed at 
least 30 months follow-up after dose 2. It is noted that, in accordance with 
the  protocols  of  both  studies,  the  EOS  analysis  (step  2)  was  not  to  be 
performed before  the  final  HZ  efficacy  analysis  (step  1).  In  study  ZOSTER-
022,  the  two-steps  planned  analyses  occurred  at  once.  Following  the 
Applicant’s decision to terminate the ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 studies 
earlier  than  initially  anticipated,  the  cut-off  date  for  EOS  efficacy  analysis 
(step 2) of the studies was 21 April 2015.  
The mean (±SD) follow-up time was 3.9 (±0.7) years for EOS analysis. 
The median (min - max) follow-up time was 4.1 (0 – 4.5) years.

Reduction of HZ-related complications (other than PHN) 
Reduction in use of pain medications 
Reduction of PHN incidence in subjects with a confirmed HZ episode 
EOS, mTVC, ≥ 50 YOA 
It was not possible to conclude on these objectives due to the high HZ VE, 
resulting in a low number of confirmed HZ cases in the HZ/su group. 
Overall and in all age strata, no HZ-related mortality and no HZ-related 
hospitalization was reported. VE in terms of reduction of HZ-related 
mortality or HZ-related hospitalization could not be calculated.

2.5.3.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-
analysis) 
ZOSTER-006/022 pooled analysis 
Pooled data analyses of ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 allowed for PHN to be selected as a primary 
endpoint in order to provide a direct assessment of the VE against PHN. 
Methodology 
The primary objective of ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 was to evaluate VE in the prevention of HZ 
compared to placebo in adults ≥50 YOA and ≥70 YOA respectively, as measured by the reduction in 
HZ risk. VE against PHN was evaluated in the individual ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 studies as a 
secondary objective. However, the analysis in these studies was not powered to demonstrate PHN VE. 
A series of pooled analyses from the 2 studies were also pre-specified. PHN VE was assessed based on 
these pre-specified pooled analyses. 
Pooling of ZOSTER-006 and -022 efficacy data was justified based on their similar study design and 
because the subjects ≥70 YOA were randomized between the 2 studies. The two studies started and 
were conducted simultaneously at the same study sites. 
ZOSTER-022 was designed as a separate study from ZOSTER-006, to allow the evaluation of the VE 
against PHN by ensuring enrolment of a sufficiently large number of subjects ≥70 YOA. Including this 
large cohort of subjects ≥70 YOA in one study would have introduced an imbalance in the age group 
distribution in ZOSTER-006, that could have biased the overall estimate of efficacy against HZ in the 
≥50 YOA cohort, under the assumption that efficacy would decrease with age. As the initial assumption 
on this candidate HZ vaccine was that the efficacy would likely decrease with age, the Applicant 
designed ZOSTER-006 specifically to provide an estimate of VE against HZ in the overall ≥50 YOA 
study population (primary objective) deemed to be more demographically representative of the older 
adult population. 
It was predicted that ZOSTER-006 would reach the conditions for triggering final analysis of the HZ 
primary endpoint more than one year prior to those conditions being reached for ZOSTER-022. 
Therefore the Applicant decided to dissociate the analyses of the two studies. 
Objectives 
The co-primary objectives of the pooled analysis of ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 were: 
1.  To evaluate VE in the prevention of PHN and 
2.  To consolidate VE estimation in the prevention of HZ, 
compared to placebo in subjects ≥70 YOA across both phase III studies. 
The secondary objectives of the pooled analysis were: 
1.  To evaluate VE in the prevention of overall PHN compared to placebo in subjects ≥50 YOA; 
2.  To evaluate VE in the prevention of PHN compared to placebo in subjects ≥50 YOA with 
confirmed HZ; 
3.  To evaluate VE in reducing the total duration of severe ‘worst’ HZ-associated pain over the 
entire pain reporting period compared to placebo in subjects ≥70 YOA, with confirmed HZ; 
4.  To evaluate vaccine safety and reactogenicity in subjects ≥70 YOA. 
The exploratory objectives of the pooled analysis were: 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 95/170 
 
  
1.  To evaluate VE in reducing the severity of acute HZ-associated pain compared to placebo in 
subjects ≥70 YOA, with confirmed HZ; 
2.  To evaluate VE in improving QoL compared to placebo in subjects ≥70 YOA, with confirmed 
HZ; 
3.  To evaluate vaccine induced humoral immune responses and the persistence of each type of 
response after two injections of study vaccine in subjects ≥50 YOA and by age strata; 
4.  To evaluate anti-varicella-zoster virus (VZV) neutralizing antibody (Ab) titres in a subset of 
subjects at Month 0 (pre-vaccination), and at Months 3, 14, 26 and 38, in subjects ≥50 YOA 
and by age strata; 
5.  To assess correlation of the humoral immune responses at Month 3 with protection against HZ. 
As a post-hoc analysis, the VE in the reduction in incidence of HZ-associated complications compared 
to placebo in all subjects ≥50 YOA and ≥70 YOA was also evaluated on the pooled data of ZOSTER-006 
and ZOSTER-022. 
Endpoints 
Co-primary endpoints for pooled analysis were the occurrence of overall PHN and the occurrence of 
confirmed HZ during the entire study period in subjects ≥70 YOA. 
Secondary endpoints for pooled analysis: 
•  Occurrence of PHN during the study in subjects ≥50 YOA 
•  Occurrence of PHN during the study in the ≥50 YOA subjects of a confirmed HZ episode  
•  Duration of severe ‘worst’ HZ-associated pain in the ≥70 YOA subjects of a confirmed HZ 
episode  
In the pooled analysis, incidence of HZ complications was evaluated as a post-hoc analysis. 
Exploratory endpoints for the pooled analysis (like in each individual study) were: acute HZ severity 
determined by mean Area Under Curve (AUC) score measured by ZBPI during a 4-week period after 
zoster rash onset, HZ interference with QoL in subjects of confirmed HZ, HZ BOI as determined by 
mean AUC score during a 26-week period after zoster rash onset in the mTVC.  
In the pooled analysis, anti-gE and anti-VZV Ab concentrations at Months 0 and 3 in all subjects with 
confirmed HZ were compared to matched controls, to explore any correlation between antibody 
response and protection (refer to subsection on correlate of protection in this section). 
Statistical power and analysis 
The pooled analysis allowed for the estimation of overall PHN VE (subjects ≥50 YOA), PHN VE in 
subjects ≥70 YOA and a more robust estimation of HZ VE in subjects ≥70 YOA. 
The pooled analysis of ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 provided the highest power to generate 
statistically significant results, and was powered to demonstrate statistically significant PHN VE in 
subjects ≥70 YOA. VE against PHN was demonstrated if the LL of the 95% CI was above 0%. 
In addition, VE against PHN in subjects ≥50 YOA with confirmed HZ was performed on the pooled data 
from both studies as a secondary objective.

Table 23.  Summary of statistical inferential evaluations of primary and secondary objectives for 
studies ZOSTER-006, ZOSTER-022 and the pooled analysis 
The pooled analysis was also performed in the 70-79 YOA and ≥80 YOA strata. 
Pooled analysis 
The cut-off dates for end of study (EOS) analyses of the ZOSTER-006 and the ZOSTER-022 studies 
were planned after the accumulation at least 35 PHN cases in subjects ≥70 YOA in the pooled ZOSTER-
006 and ZOSTER-022.  
The pooled analysis (VE against PHN) could be undertaken only provided the primary objective of both 
studies (VE against HZ) were demonstrated (i.e. clinically meaningful overall HZ VE in subjects ≥50 
YOA and in subjects ≥70 YOA was reached respectively in ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022. 
The primary analysis of efficacy was based on the modified TVC (mTVC) for efficacy (i.e. TVC for 
efficacy excluding subjects who did not receive the 2nd dose of HZ/su or who developed a confirmed 
case of HZ prior to 1 month after the 2nd dose). 
An analysis on the TVC (Intent-to-treat [ITT] population) for efficacy was planned for sensitivity 
analyses according to ICH recommendation, in order to check for consistent results with the primary 
analyses. The TVC analysis started to count HZ cases from the first vaccination onwards.  
Given the very high HZ VE observed in ZOSTER-006, the statistical power reached for the key HZ and 
PHN VE endpoints and because of the need to cross-vaccinate subjects in the Placebo group, the 
Applicant decided to terminate ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 earlier than initially planned. After 
review of the unblinded final HZ/su efficacy data and unblinded available safety data of ZOSTER-006, 
the IDMC stated that they did not have any objections to GSK’s proposed plan for stopping both trials, 
ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022, in terms of subjects’ interest and data integrity. 
Similarity of the VE across the strata analysed was to be assessed graphically. Similarity of the VE was 
also to be assessed by means of exact tests of homogeneity of the VE. However, these tests were only 
done for the pooled analysis due to the high similarity of VE across age strata. Consistent and high 
vaccine efficacies across strata justified the statement of homogeneity across strata. 
In other situations, the impact of potential heterogeneity on the study conclusions was to be assessed 
using sensitivity analyses.

The objectives of the pooled analysis are endorsed. This analysis was well designed with strong 
rationale, and robust methods. The Applicant considered that the VE estimate for registration purposes 
should be based on mTVC, provided there was no essential VE difference between the mTVC and TVC 
analyses, which is endorsed. 
Trials had a nearly identical study design. Beside age of the subjects, the only difference was that only 
subjects enrolled into ZOSTER-006 study were randomly allocated to be part of the CMI component as 
additional exploratory endpoint. 
Results 
The first subject enrolled in one of the 2 studies was on 02 August 2010. The last study visit/contact 
for the pooled analysis was 27 July 2015. 
The cut-off date for EOS efficacy analysis was 21 April 2015 (i.e. all suspected HZ episodes with onset 
date up to and including 21 April 2015 were considered for efficacy analyses at the EOS analysis step). 
Database freeze for EOS analysis occurred on 12 October 2015. 
At the time of the EOS HZ and PHN analysis, the median (min to max) follow-up periods (mTVC) were: 
  ZOSTER-006:    
  ZOSTER-022:    
  Pooled for subjects ≥70 YOA:   4.0 (0 - 4.5) years. 
4.1 (0 to 4.5) years. 
3.9 (0.4 to 4.5) years. 
Results of the pooled analysis are provided in the ZOSTER-022 EOS report. Correlate of protection 
(CoP) analysis conducted on ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 pooled were presented in a ZOSTER-022 
annex report (see at the end of this section). Data regarding anti-VZV ELISA Ab concentrations (all 
time points) were presented in a ZOSTER-022 annex report (see section 2.4.3). The neutralizing Ab 
assay was not performed. 
Study population 
ZOSTER-006 enrolled subjects ≥50 YOA, of whom 15,405 were included in the EOS analysis (TVC). 
ZOSTER-022 enrolled subjects ≥70 YOA, of whom 13,900 subjects were included in the TVC. 
Overall, for the pooled analysis: 
  29,305 were included in the pooled TVC (14,645 in the Hz/su Group and 14,660 in the Placebo 
Group). 
  27,916 were included in the pooled mTVC (13,881 in the HZ/su Group and 14,035 in the 
Placebo Group). 
The number of subjects in the pooled mTVC by age category is presented in Table 25. 15,400 of the 
subjects (52.6%) from the pooled analysis (TVC) were enrolled in European sites.

Demographic characteristics and other baseline characteristics 
Demographic characteristics at baseline were comparable across groups overall and within age strata. 
Women were overrepresented in both groups. In the ≥80 YOA strata, median age is 82 years in both 
group indicating that around 900 subjects in both groups were 82 YOA or above (i.e. <7%). 
Efficacy analysis against HZ in subjects ≥70YOA (mTVC) 
Efficacy against HZ overall and by age stratum 
Only very few confirmed HZ episodes occurred in the vaccinated subjects (25 in the HZ/su group in 
comparison with 284 in the Placebo group). Overall VE against HZ was 91.30% (95%CI: 86.88%-
94.46%) in subjects ≥70 YOA. The primary objective of the pooled analysis regarding HZ VE in 
subjects ≥70 YOA was met. 
In the pooled analysis, VE was very high and consistent across age categories across and within 
studies using Poisson method. 
In subjects ≥ 70 YOA, the overall incidence of HZ per 1000 person-years for the pooled ZOSTER-
006/022 was 0.8 in the HZ/su group and 9.3 in the Placebo group. In the placebo group incidence 
rates of HZ tended to increase slightly with age.

and overall using Poisson method (mTVC Cohort, subjects ≥ 70YOA - POOLED ZOSTER 006-022) 
Efficacy against HZ by time 
VE by year following vaccine administration is presented in table 27. VE decreased slightly but was 
maintained at very high level over 4 years in individuals ≥ 70 YOA.

This is confirmed by cumulative VE estimations (post-hoc analysis). The overall HZ VE was 97.58% 
(95% CI: 90.97% - 99.71%; P<0.0001) up to Year 1; 94.71% (95% CI: 89.72% - 97.62%; 
P<0.0001) up to Year 2; 92.15% (95% CI: 87.31% - 95.43%; P<0.0001) up to Year 3 and 91.30% 
(95% CI: 86.88% - 94.46%; P<0.0001) up to Year 4. Analyses show consistent findings across age 
strata.

(modified Total Vaccinated Cohort, subjects ≥70YOA -POOLED ZOSTER 006-022) 
Sensitivity analyses 
No substantial differences were observed for VE against HZ using the Poisson method, by gender as 
well as by region. 
Efficacy against PHN (mTVC) 
Efficacy against PHN in ≥70YOA overall and by age stratum 
A PHN episode was reported in 4 subjects in the HZ/su Group and 36 in the Placebo group. HZ/su 
significantly reduces the risk of PHN compared to placebo. Overall VE against PHN was 88.78% (95% 
CI: 68.70%-97.10%; P<0.0001). The co-primary confirmatory objective of the pooled ZOSTER-
006/022 regarding PHN VE in subjects ≥70 YOA was met (Table 28). Incidence rates of subjects 
reporting at least one event of PHN per 1000 persons-years are presented in the same table. 
PHN VE could not be demonstrated in the ≥80 YOA stratum, which is likely due to the lower number of 
subjects reporting PHN episodes. 
VE against PHN were not substantially different in the TVC and ATP cohorts of analysis.

Efficacy against PHN in ≥50 YOA and according to age 
In subjects ≥50 YOA, a PHN episode was reported in 4 subjects in the HZ/su Group and 46 in the 
Placebo group. The overall PHN VE was 91.22% (95% CI: 75.95%-97.70%; P<0.0001). VE against 
PHN was very high in subjects 50-69 YOA, but with wide CI. VE against PHN was higher in subjects 
below 70 as compared to subjects ≥70 YOA. VE was higher in subjects 70-79 YOA as compared to 
subjects ≥80 YOA. VE tended to decrease with age (table 29). It has to be noted however, the number 
of cases is small within age categories, especially in the oldest, and CIs are wide.

and overall using Poisson method (mTVC, subjects ≥50YOA - POOLED ZOSTER 006-022) 
PHN frequency in the Placebo group 
The incidence rate of subjects reporting at least one PHN episode in the Placebo group tended to 
increase with age (from 0.6 in 50-59YOA to 1.1 in >80YOA). The overall risk of PHN in subjects who 
presented HZ was 9.6% (46/477), and also tended to increase with age.  
Post-hoc analysis on vaccine efficacy against PHN (alternative definitions)  
During the procedure the Applicant was requested to present the following results for the pooled 
analyses: Vaccine efficacy against PHN by time, and VE according to alternative definitions of PHN, 
based on duration of pain of 30, 60, 120 and 180 days (as indicated in ZOSTER-006 study protocol). 
These data were presented with the exception of VE in the prevention of PHN over time. VE in the 
prevention of PHN over time should be provided via the ZOSTER-049 trial.  
The VE against PHN according to alternative PHN definitions (based on duration of pain of ≥30, ≥60, 
≥120 and ≥180 days) were 93.25% (95% CI, 84.72% to 97.59%), 91.61% (95% CI, 77.08% to 
97.80%), 95.41% (95% CI, 71.57% to 99.90%) and 100% (95% CI, 72% to 100%) in adults ≥70 
YOA, respectively, in the pooled analysis. These VE results are in line with the point estimate of 
85.49% (95% CI, 58.52% to 96.30%) in adults ≥70 YOA from ZOSTER-022 with PHN defined by pain 
duration ≥90 days. 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 102/170 
 
  
 
The Applicant acknowledged that, according to the protocol, these VE endpoints were planned to be 
reported as secondary endpoints. However, only the generally accepted definition of PHN (i.e., ≥90 
days) was used for VE analysis.  
Reduction of duration of severe ‘worst’ HZ associated pain in subjects ≥ 70 YOA 
In subjects with a confirmed HZ episode, the median (min - max) duration of severe ‘worst’ HZ-
associated pain over the entire pain reported period was: 
  11.5 days (1.0 - 162.0 days) in the HZ/su group, 
  19.0 days (1.0 - 834.0 days) in the Placebo group. 
The overall VE in terms of reduction of duration of severe ‘worst’ HZ-associated pain was 30.48% 
(95% CI: -10.52% - 56.27%). It was not possible to conclude on this objective due to the high HZ VE, 
resulting in a low number of confirmed HZ cases in the HZ/su group. 
Reduction of PHN incidence in subjects ≥ 50 YOA with a confirmed HZ episode 
In subjects with a confirmed HZ episode, PHN was reported in 4 out of 32 subjects of the HZ/su group 
and 46 out of 477 subjects of the Placebo group. The overall VE in terms of reduction of PHN incidence 
in subjects with a confirmed HZ episode was 0.29% (95% CI: -161.53% -65.57%). It was not possible 
to conclude on this objective due to the high HZ VE, resulting in a low number of confirmed HZ cases 
in the HZ/su group. 
Numerically, 4/32 (12.50%) subjects with confirmed HZ in vaccine group developed PHN and 46/477 
(9.64%) subjects in the placebo group, according to the pooled analysis. The concern of increasing 
PHN risk in these subgroups is theoretical but nevertheless the Applicant was asked during the 
procedure to re-calculate cases using “relax” PHN definition, i.e. zoster pain persisting or appearing 
more than 60 days or 30 days after rash onset, and to conduct additional analysis using re-calculated 
number of PHN cases. 
For “relaxed” PHN 60 days: 5/32 (15.63%, 95%CI: 5.28, 32.79) subjects ≥ 50 YOA with confirmed HZ 
in vaccine group developed PHN whereas 64/477 (13.42%, 95%CI: 10.49, 16.81) subjects in placebo 
group. 
For “relaxed” PHN 30 days: 8/32 (25.00%, 95%CI: 11.46, 43.40) subjects ≥ 50 YOA with confirmed 
HZ in vaccine group developed PHN whereas 126/477 (26.42%, 95%CI: 22.51, 30.61) subjects in 
placebo group. 
With regard to 95%CI, similar patterns as those observed in primary analysis (i.e. PHN 90 days) are 
observed and therefore a valid statistical conclusion is still not possible.  
The available data on efficacy of HZ/su in preventing PHN in subjects with confirmed HZ do not allow 
drawing a statistically relevant conclusion. However it is noted that with reduction of the number of 
days, the number of PHN cases increases in both groups, and the difference in the percentage of 
confirmed HZ cases developing PHN between two groups is reduced. In addition, the Applicant 
reported the observation that HZ and PHN episodes in vaccine group are generally milder in nature 
than those reported in placebo recipients. 
Post-hoc analysis: efficacy against HZ-related complications (other than PHN) 
Complications related to HZ were reported for 1 subject (1 complication) in the HZ/su Group and 16 
subjects (17 complications) in the Placebo group (Pooled analysis, ≥50 YOA). The HZ related 
complications (other than PHN) reported during the entire study period were (mTVC) Ophthalmic 
disease (n=1) in the HZ/su Group and Ophthalmic disease (n=7), Disseminated disease (n=6), 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 103/170 
 
  
Neurological disease (n=3) and HZ vasculitis (n=1) in the Placebo group. No cases of visceral disease 
or stroke were reported during these studies in either groups. 
In the Placebo Group, the incidence of complications tended to increase with age. Most of the 
complications occurred in the subjects ≥70 YOA so that VE cannot be estimated in subjects 50-59 YOA 
and 60-69 YOA. 
The overall VE against HZ related complications was: 
  93.71% (95% CI: 59.53% - 99.85%; P=0.0003) in subjects ≥ 50 YOA (1 vs. 16 cases, p-
value: 0.0003) 
  91.62% (95% CI: 43.38% - 99.80%; P=0.0035) in subjects ≥ 70 YOA (1 vs. 12 cases, p-
value: 0.0035). 
Post-hoc analysis on vaccine efficacy against use and duration of pain medication 
Use and duration of pain medication administered in subjects with confirmed HZ was not part of the 
objectives of the pooled analysis. During the procedure the Applicant was asked to perform a post hoc 
analysis on this parameter for subjects ≥70 YOA, using pooled data of ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 
to improve the estimates obtained from ZOSTER-022.

Post-hoc analysis on the incidence of severe and long-lasting zoster pain 
In order to understand whether the vaccine can effectively reduce incidence of severe and long-lasting 
zoster pain, e.g. score of >600 by ZBPI, in the population of studied subjects, the Applicant was asked 
during the procedure to conduct such analysis. 
The number of subjects with a ZBPI worst pain score Area Under the Curve (AUC) for days 0-182 >600 
was calculated for both the ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 pooled data. In the ZOSTER-006 analysis, 
0/8 subjects in the vaccine group and 7/241 in the placebo group had a ZBPI worst pain score AUC 
Days 0-182 >600. 
Similarly, in the ZOSTER-022 pooled analysis 1/23 subjects in the vaccine group and 19/263 in the 
placebo group had a ZBPI worst pain score AUC Days 0-182 >600. 
The analyses were performed on the Modified Total Vaccinated Cohort Confirmed Cases HZ ZBPI 
Evaluable Subgroup, which excludes any subject without a ZBPI questionnaire within 14 days following 
rash onset. 
The point estimates would suggest that there is an attenuation of long term severity in breakthrough 
cases, however the confidence intervals are extremely wide due to the small sample size in 
breakthrough cases (i.e. due to very high vaccine efficacy). As such no definitive conclusion can be 
drawn from this analysis. 
Exploratory objectives - Quality of Life results 
After pooling, analysis of QoL parameters in the evaluable subgroup of mTVC HZ confirmed cases, who 
had a first ZBPI evaluation visit within 14 days of the first date of rash, revealed statistically significant 
reduction in the vaccine group compared to placebo group, in terms of worst ZBPI scores. In subjects 
≥70 YOA (pooled data) with at least one confirmed HZ episode, HZ/su significantly reduced the 
maximum worst pain score vs. placebo over the entire HZ episode (mean = 5.7 vs. 7.0, P-value = 
0.032) and the maximum average pain score (mean= 4.5 vs. 5.6, P-value = 0.043). There was no 
Assessment report

statistically significantly difference in terms on worst ZBPI scores for Activities of Daily Living (ADL) 
(mean=3.9 vs. 4.6, P-value= 0.26). 
There were no statistically significant differences between the HZ/su group and the Placebo group in 
the pooled analyses on AUC scores for ZBPI worst pain, ZBPI average pain and ZBPI ADL scores or on 
time to resolution of clinically significant pain, in HZ ZBPI evaluable subgroup of the mTVC HZ 
confirmed cases. However, all mean scores at all time points (30, 90 and 182 days) were generally 
lower in the HZ/su group than in the Placebo group. 
The mean scores for severity of illness and severity of interference were statistically significantly lower 
in the HZ/su group compared to the Placebo group, overall and by age stratum (P<0.0001) according 
to Chang and Chop-lump tests. The overall VE estimate against burden of illness was 92.1% (95% CI: 
90.4%-93.8%) in subjects ≥70 YOA (pooled analysis), with point estimates of 95.1% in the 70-79 YOA 
stratum and 82.2% in the ≥80 YOA stratum. The overall VE estimate against the burden of 
interference was 90.3% (95% CI: 88.5%-92.1%) with point estimates of 95.8% in the 70-79 YOA 
stratum and 73.8% in the ≥80 YOA stratum.  
Only few statistically significant differences were observed between the study groups for the worst 
score over time in the SF-36 or EQ-5D scale, in favour of placebo, and the pattern was not consistently 
in favour of one of the groups. 
Immunogenicity results – humoral (ZOSTER-006 and pooled ZOSTER-006/022) 
In the 2 pivotal efficacy studies, humoral immune response evaluations were performed in a subset of 
subjects. A total of 2,137 and 799 subjects (of which 1,070 and 387 subjects were in the HZ/su group) 
were part of the ATP cohort for immunogenicity in ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022, respectively. 
For anti-gE antibody responses measured by ELISA at Month 3 post Dose 2, the median fold increase 
above pre-vaccination level was 41.9 in ATP subjects ≥50 YOA (ZOSTER-006) and 34.3 in ATP subjects 
≥70 YOA (pooled analysis of ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022).

pooled data, like was seen in ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 studies. Stratification by age stratum

Persistence of immune responses 
The results of the follow-up Phase II clinical studies ZOSTER-018, 019 (Extension of EXPLO-CRD-004; 
measurements at M30 and M42), ZOSTER-011, 012, 013 (Extension of 003- measurements at M12, 
M24, M36), and ZOSTER-024 (Extension of 003- measurements at M48, M60, M72) provided data on 
the persistence of the immunogenicity of the vaccine. Additionally, the immunogenicity of HZ/su was 
evaluated up until 3 years after vaccination in the Phase III clinical studies ZOSTER-006 and 022, as 
just discussed. 
Immunogenicity data after 2 doses, measured 12, 24 and 36 months after the first dose in all ZOSTER-
003 study groups were also generated in ZOSTER-011, ZOSTER-012 and ZOSTER-013, respectively, in 
the TVC for persistence. Data at all of these time-points on gE-specific and VZV-specific (only Month 
36) CMI and humoral immune response to gE in the HZ/su group were re-analysed in the ATP cohort 
for immunogenicity in ZOSTER-024, a phase II, open-label, single group, follow-up clinical study in 119 
adults ≥60 years. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate CMI and humoral immune 
responses to HZ/su in older adults (≥60 YOA at enrolment in ZOSTER-003), overall and within each 
age cohort (60-69 YOA and ≥70 YOA at enrolment in ZOSTER-003) at Months 48, 60 and 72. 
The protocol for Study ZOSTER-024 described the usage of a mixed model for the frequency of CD4 T-
cells producing at least 2 immunological activation markers with log-transformed background CD4 
frequency, log-transformed pre-vaccination response and the log-transformed time elapsed (measured 
in months) following the last vaccination as covariates. A similar approach as to that described for the 
CMI endpoint was to be followed for Humoral Immune response. The covariates will include pre-
vaccination response and time OR the log-transformed time elapsed following the last vaccination 
(measured in months) according to the goodness of fit statistics (AIC or SBIC). Three models were 
considered for persistence of immunogenicity: Piece-wise, Power-law and Fraser. Overall, the models 
applied to assess persistence of antibody titre were deemed acceptable. 
Data from ZOSTER-024 indicate that the vaccine-induced immune response (humoral and CMI) 
persists up to approximately 6 years following a 0, 2-month schedule. The median anti-gE antibody 
concentration was greater than 7-fold above the baseline pre-vaccination median concentration. The 
median frequency of gE-specific CD4[2+] T cells was greater than 3.7-fold above baseline pre-
vaccination median frequency.

To allow a better assessment of persistence of immune responses, clinically more relevant endpoints 
for persistence were considered, such as the percentage of responders as defined by the fraction of 
patients above the 95 percentile of baseline measures, or the fraction of patients with a k-fold increase 
to baseline. Modelling of the average population would not allow conclusions on the more extreme 
patients, which are generally more vulnerable. Therefore, during the procedure additional analyses 
were performed on the ZOSTER-024 data for the persistence of the immune response of HZ/su using 
the percentage of responders as defined by (i) the percentage of subjects above the 95th percentile of 
baseline measures, and (ii) the percentage of subjects with a k-fold increase from baseline.  
The percentage of responders above the 95th percentile of baseline was 99.3% at Month 3, which then 
declined but was still 64.7% at 72 months post-vaccination. The cumulative percentage of subjects 
above a specific k-fold increase declined over time, but 70.6% of subjects still presented with at least a 
4-fold increase in gE-specifc humoral immune response at 72 months post-vaccination.  
The decline in the cell-mediated immune (CMI) response over time seemed more substantial than that 
observed for the anti-gE antibody humoral response. The percentage of responders above the 95th 
percentile of baseline declined over time but was still 27.3% at Month 72. The percentage of subjects 
above a specific k-fold increase declined over time, then reached a plateau. The percentage of subjects 
presenting with at least a 2-fold increase in gE-specific CMI response was still 62.7% at Month 72 
post-vaccination.  
Correlate of protection 
Currently, no correlate of protection for HZ/su has been established. The identification of a CoP was a 
pre-specified endpoint of the phase III efficacy studies ZOSTER-006 and 022. The analysis was 
performed on pooled ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 breakthrough HZ cases and was provided with the 
responses to the D120 LoQ. Although it is generally assumed that the immune mechanism of 
protection against VZV reactivation is mainly cell-mediated, investigating a CoP for CMI poses 
significant challenges. Therefore the Applicant decided to explore a potential correlation between 
efficacy and the anti-gE antibody response 1 month post-vaccination using the Applicant’s gE-ELISA 
assay, although as said it is unclear if this specific immune response is directly involved or not in 
protection against VZV reactivation. Of note, the anti-gE antibody response measured by ELISA one 
month after the second vaccine dose has been correlated with 1) the anti-VZV neutralizing response 
and 2) the gE-specific CD4+ T-cell response at the same time point. 
The objectives of the CoP analyses in studies ZOSTER-006 and 022 were: 
1.  To evaluate if the anti-gE antibody concentrations, as determined by the gE-ELISA, at Month 3 
(one month post-dose 2), and/or the anti-gE antibody fold increase from baseline, as determined 
by gE-ELISA at month 3 (one month post-dose 2), correlate with shingles protection (based on 
confirmed HZ cases); 
2.  To determine, if possible, a protective threshold. 
The statistical method used to validate the correlate of protection (Prentice method), and the statistical 
method used to identify a threshold (Dunning regression) are not explained here. Additional methods 
have also been evaluated by the Applicant. The cohorts used for the analyses include all evaluable 
subjects from studies ZOSTER- 006 and 022 who received two doses of the vaccine, excluding: 
• 
• 
subjects who were excluded from all statistical analyses due to GCP issues (i.e. one study site 
in Mexico); 
subjects who received vaccine doses or replacement not according to their randomization 
group; 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 110/170 
 
  
• 
subjects who developed a confirmed case of herpes zoster (HZ) prior to blood sampling at 
Month 3 (one month post dose 2). 
A case-cohort subsample (i.e. Cohort for CoP) was taken and consisted of (i) an immunogenicity 
subset randomly selected from the whole study population, and (ii) all the subjects with a confirmed 
HZ case. 
Overall the approaches (case-cohort design, non-mechanistic CoP, predictive paradigm, continuous 
approach) and methodological choices (Prentice and Qin frameworks) made by the Applicant are sound 
and well justified. It is also agreed that an immune marker not causally involved in the clinical 
protection could still constitute a good non-mechanistic CoP with respect to guiding regulatory 
decisions, the main condition being that it should reliably predict VE (validation based on statistical 
criteria).  
The descriptive analysis of anti-gE antibody responses measured by gE-ELISA at Month 3 (i.e. one 
month after dose 2) and the reverse cumulative curve (RCC) of the gE ELISA concentration measure at 
the same time point by study and by clinical outcome (i.e. confirmed HZ cases or no cases) show a 
clear distinction between the placebo and vaccine recipients distribution, and a trend for lower titres in 
subjects with HZ cases, including in placebo recipients, which may be an indication that a decrease in 
natural anti-gE antibodies is associated with a greater risk of HZ.  
 The correlation was estimated at the individual level (between anti-gE ELISA and probability of 
protection) and at the population level (between regional anti-gE ELISA GMR and regional vaccine 
efficacy). Both analyses suggest that probability of protection (at the individual level) and efficacy (at 
the population level) might be predicted based on these immune measurements, and thus that anti-gE 
ELISA Ab might be a useful immune marker to guide regulatory decisions in individuals ≥50 years old.  
However uncertainties and limitations remain.. Furthermore, the model linking anti-gE to probability of 
protection still needs to be further understood. The factors that could affect immunogenicity, efficacy, 
and the relationship between the CoP and VE were further explored, in particular age and pre-existing 
immunity level. Although the effect of age on both efficacy and immunogenicity is statistically 
significant, this effect is considered clinically negligible given the extremely high effect of the vaccine in 
this immunocompetent population. Concerning pre-existing immunity, given the very high efficacy 
level, a clinically relevant impact of the level of pre-existing immunity on VE is considered unlikely in 
the immunocompetent population studied. It is acknowledged that the Applicant plans to study the CoP 
in their IC efficacy trial.   
At this stage, the CoP is not sufficiently understood and validated to be considered as an established 
general CoP. However post-dose 2 anti-gE can be used as an immune marker for immunobridging in 
immunocompetent individuals ≥50 years of age. The extent to which this immune marker can be 
extrapolated to other conditions or populations will have to be discussed on a case-by-case basis, as 
there could be a potential impact of CMI on protection which has not been considered.Notwithstanding, 
it is agreed that immunobridging in certain circumstances is possible based on anti
gE non-inferiority 
(see section2.5.6 and 3.3).

2.5.4.  Clinical studies in special populations 
Immunocompromised patients 
HZ is more frequent and more severe in immunocompromised individuals. No vaccine is currently 
available for immunosuppressed individuals.

Two phase I/II clinical studies, ZOSTER-001 and ZOSTER-015, were conducted with HZ/su in subjects 
with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant or HIV infection, respectively. A total of 135 adults, 
of whom 73 were ≥50 years of age, received at least one dose of vaccine, which was shown to be 
immunogenic and well-tolerated.  
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) recipients, whose T cell immunity is deeply impaired, 
have a high 30% risk of HZ during the first year following HCT. These patients are at increased risk for 
viremia and visceral dissemination during VZV reactivation and subsequent complications. 
2.5.4.1.  ZOSTER-001 
Study title: A Phase I/IIa randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to 
evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of gE/AS01B in comparison to gE combined with 1/2 dose 
AS01B adjuvant (gE/AS01E) and to saline (placebo) when administered as 2 doses or 3 doses to 
autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) recipients. 
Methods 
•  Objectives and inclusion criteria 
ZOSTER-001 was conducted at 10 centres in the United States in 2009-2011.  
Co-Primary objectives were:  
  To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of the gE/AS01B and gE/AS01E study vaccines in 
adult autologous HCT recipients; 
  To compare gE-specific humoral and cellular immune responses at Month 4 (one month post-
final vaccination) between subjects who received three doses of gE/AS01B vaccine (Months 0, 1 
and 3), subjects who received three doses of gE/AS01E vaccine (Months 0, 1 and 3), subjects 
who received two doses of gE/AS01B vaccine (Months 1 and 3) and subjects who received 
placebo. 
Secondary objectives comprised the comparison of several additional humoral and cellular 
immunological assessments at different time points, and the description of the incidence, duration and 
severity of HZ and its complications during the entire study period in each of the four study groups. 
Eligible subjects were patients who underwent autologous HCT within the past 50-70 days for 
treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (T or B cell), myeloma or Acute Myeloid 
Leukaemia (AML), and for whom there are no plans for additional HCTs. 
•  Study design 
A total of 120 eligible HCT recipients had to be randomised, according to a 1:1:1:1 ratio in four parallel 
groups: 
1.  gE/AS01B 3-dose (Months 0, 1 and 3); 30 subjects. 
2.  gE/AS01E 3-dose (Months 0, 1 and 3); 30 subjects. 
3.  gE/AS01B 2-dose (placebo at Month 0 and gE/AS01B at Months 1 and 3); 30 subjects. 
4.  The placebo group (placebo at Months 0, 1 and 3); 30 subjects. 
Month 0 was defined as 50-70 days (approximately 2 months) post-HCT. The study lasted 15 months 
per subject, including follow-up for 12 months after the third vaccination to assess safety and 
persistence of immune response.  
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 112/170 
 
  
The randomization algorithm used a minimization procedure accounting for underlying-disease strata 
(Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin T cell lymphoma or acute myeloid leukemia (AML); non-Hodgkin B-
cell lymphoma; myeloma). Persons in Strata 1 typically do not receive post-HCT immunosuppressive 
therapy, while those in the other two strata do receive post-HCT immunosuppressive therapy. Strata 2 
and 3 are separated because the nature of post-HCT immunosuppressive therapy differs significantly 
between those populations. 
•  Treatment 
The dose of the VZV-gE antigen selected for use in this study was based on the results of a phase II 
dose ranging study (ZOSTER-003, individuals >60YOA) with or without AS01B. Based on the data of 
this study, the 50 µg gE antigen dose with adjuvant was selected. 
Vaccination started 2 months after HCT and this was based on existing data with an inactivated 
varicella vaccine (Varivax) and on the need to induce strong immunity as soon as possible after HCT. 
Results 
•  Study population 
A total of 120 subjects were enrolled and vaccinated. A total of 110 of the 120 (91.7%) vaccinated 
subjects completed the active phase of the study (up to Month 4). The most common reason for 
withdrawal was transplant failure/recurrence of underlying malignancy.  
The four groups were comparable with respect to mean age and gender distribution, baseline 
seropositivity rates and geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) of anti-gE antibody, underlying disease 
leading to HCT, prior treatment, type of HCT and source of stem cells. 
The most common concomitant medication in all four groups was HZ antiviral prophylaxis (received by 
96%-100% of subjects overall). The proportion of subjects in each group who received any 
immunosuppressant was 27% (gE/AS01B 3-dose group), 28% (gE/AS01E 3-dose group), 19% 
(gE/AS01B 2-dose group) and 13% (3-dose placebo group). 
•  Humoral responses through Month 4 of the study 
The first dose of both vaccines elicited at least a two-fold increase in GMC of anti-gE antibody.  
One month after the second dose, the GMC increased 22- and 21-fold compared to baseline for both 
vaccines. At this time point, the anti-gE GMC following the first dose of gE/AS01B in the 2-dose Group 
was 2-fold higher compared to baseline.   
At Month 4, the anti-gE GMC following the third dose of gE/AS01B and gE/AS01E was 55- and 42-fold 
higher, respectively, compared to baseline. At this time point the anti-gE GMC following the second 
dose of gE/AS01B in the 2-dose Group was 25-fold higher compared to baseline. GMCs of anti-gE ab 
were 13,413 mIU/mL (95%CI: 4967-36,220) at Month 3 (post-dose 2) and 29,193 mIU/mL (95%CI: 
11,005-77,442) at Month 4 (post-dose 3) in the gE/AS01B three dose Group. Of note, GMCs of anti-gE 
ab levels in healthy subject were 52,377 mIU/mL (95%CI: 50,264-54,578) at Month 3 (post-dose 2) 
(ZOSTER-006). 
The response rate 1 Month after the first dose was similar (about 30%) in the 2-dose schedule 
gE/AS01B (i.e. at Month 2) and in the 3-dose schedule gE/AS01B (i.e. at Month 1). At Month 4, vaccine 
response rates were similar across the 3 vaccinated Groups. 
The superiority of three doses of gE/AS01B versus three doses of placebo was demonstrated, as well as 
the superiority of two doses of gE/AS01B versus three doses of placebo (with respect to the co-primary 
objective relative to anti-gE humoral immune response at Month 4). Geometric means fold increase of 
anti-gE antibody ELISA concentrations over placebo at Month 4 were: 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 113/170 
 
  
  74.41 (95%CI: 25.74-215.09) in the 3-dose gE/AS01B group. 
  42.20 (95%CI: 16.07 110.82) in the 2-dose gE/AS01B group. 
  52.11 (95%CI: 17.36 156.41) in the 3-dose gE/AS01E group. 
The anti-gE humoral immune response in the gE/AS01B 3-dose group was not significantly higher 
compared to the gE/AS01E 3-dose vaccine at any post-vaccination time point as evidenced by a LL of 
the 95% CI < 1 for the fold increase in anti-gE GMC gE/AS01B over gE/AS01E for each comparison.  
•  gE- and VZV-specific Cell mediated immune responses through M4 of the study 
The superiority of three doses of gE/AS01B versus three doses of placebo was demonstrated as well as 
the superiority of two doses of gE/AS01B versus three doses of placebo, with respect to cellular 
immune response to gE at Month 4. Geometric means fold increase (over placebo) in the frequency of 
CD4(2+) T-cells at Month 4 following induction with gE were: 
  32.31 (95%CI: 17.78-58.71) in the 3-dose gE/AS01B group. 
  9.51 (95%CI: 5.23-17.32) in the 2-dose gE/AS01B group. 
  16.49 (95%CI: 8.87-30.68) in the 3-dose gE/AS01E group. 
•  Combined gE-specific humoral and cellular immune response multivariate assessment 
The superiority of three doses of gE/AS01B compared to two doses gE/AS01B was demonstrated at all 
time points. 
•  Persistence of the immune response 12 months after the third vaccination 
At month 12, the anti-gE GMC point estimates had decreased by 3- to 4-fold in the three vaccine 
groups compared to Month 4. 
Exploratory group comparisons at Month 15 suggested higher concentrations of anti-gE in gE/AS01B (2 
and 3 doses) and gE/AS01E (3 doses) as compared to placebo (the lower limit of the 95% CI on the 
GM ratio [vaccine group/Placebo] was greater than 1). 
Exploratory groups comparison at Month 15 suggested a higher frequency of CD4(2+) T-cells after 
induction with gE between gE/AS01B (2 and 3 doses) and gE/AS01E (3 doses) as compared to placebo 
(the lower limit of the 95% CI on the GMCs ratio [vaccine group/Placebo] was greater than 1). 
This analysis did not support a difference in the frequency CD4(2+)T-cells after induction with gE 
between gE/AS01B 3-dose and gE/AS01E 3-dose group (the lower limit of the 95% CI on the GMCs 
ratio [gE/AS01B 3-dose group/gE/AS01E 3-dose group] was less than 1). 
•  Occurrence of HZ 
Four cases of confirmed HZ (3 by PCR and 1 confirmed by the Applicant’s expert) were reported during 
the course of the study up to Month 15 (i.e. 12 months post dose 3): two in the gE/AS01E 3-dose 
group and two in the placebo group. 
•  Conclusion for study ZOSTER-001 
The 3-dose and 2-dose gE/AS01B regimens and the 3-dose gE/AS01E regimen elicited robust humoral 
and cellular immune responses superior to placebo in adult subjects who had undergone autologous 
HCT within 50 to 70 days prior to the first dose of vaccine. 
Study ZOSTER-001 was well justified and methodologically adequate. The study was stratified for 
underlying disease responsible for the HCT. Data collected during the study allowed to show that 
groups are roughly comparable with respect to potential confounders such as the diagnosis leading to 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 114/170 
 
  
the HCT, the treatment regimen prior to HCT, and antiviral prophylaxis. The proportion of subjects who 
received any immunosuppressant was higher in the gE/AS01B 3-dose group and the gE/AS01E 3-dose 
group in comparison to the two other groups (gE/AS01B 2-dose group and 3-dose placebo group). 
Despite this imbalance, immunogenicity levels were highest in the gE/AS01B 3-dose group and the 
gE/AS01E 3-dose group. 
With all three schedules, the second dose elicited a 21-25 fold increase in GMC of anti-gE antibody. 
Following the third dose, anti-gE GMC was 55- and 42-fold higher, respectively in the gE/AS01B and 
gE/AS01E vaccines Groups, which is comparable to the responses induced in immunocompetent 
individuals. Responses in terms of CMI were also comparable. Results in terms of responses rates 
however were lower than in immunocompetent individuals, even with 3 doses. 
Three doses of gE/AS01B administered at Months 0, 1 and 3 were significantly more immunogenic than 
2 doses of gE/AS01B administered at Months 1 and 3. 
The anti-gE humoral immune response in the gE/AS01B 3-dose group was not significantly higher 
compared to the gE/AS01E 3-dose vaccine at any post-vaccination time point. However, three doses of 
gE/AS01B tended to induced slightly better results with respect to several immunogenicity endpoints 
than three doses of gE/AS01E. 
Data showed that the candidate vaccines induced humoral and CMI immune responses that persisted 
until Month 15 (higher than placebo). 
Thus HZ/su elicited a very robust immune response, although lower than in immunocompetent 
subjects, with the 3-dose schedule performing better than 2 doses. The clinical consequences of these 
findings are impossible to determine given the absence of correlate of protection. An efficacy study is 
currently ongoing in autologous HCT recipients ≥18 YOA (ZOSTER-002). 
2.5.4.2.  ZOSTER-015 
Study title: A phase I/IIa randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study to 
evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of gE/AS01B in comparison to placebo when administered as 3 
doses to adult HIV-infected subjects. 
ZOSTER-015 was conducted in Germany, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US). 
Three cohorts of HIV-infected subjects were enrolled (n=123 of whom 28 ≥50YOA): 
1.  ART High CD4 cohort (n=74): ART-treated subjects with a CD4 T cell count: ≥200 cells/mm3. 
2.  ART Low CD4 cohort (n=14): ART-treated subjects with a CD4 T cell count: 50-199 cells/mm3. 
3.  Non-ART High CD4 cohort (n=15): ART-naïve HIV-infected subjects with a CD4 T cell count of 
≥500 cells/mm3. 
Eligible subjects were randomised (3:2) to receive 3 doses of gE/AS01B or Placebo at Month 0, 2 and 
6. A total of 123 eligible subjects were vaccinated (74 subjects in the 3-dose vaccine group and 47 
subjects in the placebo group), and 116 subjects completed the study. The mean age of the study 
participants was 46.0 years (range: 23-74 years) in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity (N=91; 
primary analysis cohort for immunogenicity). 
The primary objectives of the study were: 
  To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of the gE/AS01B study vaccine in HIV-infected 
subjects, by ART and CD4 count cohorts, and overall; 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 115/170 
 
  
  To estimate the gE-specific humoral and cellular immune responses at Month 7 (one month 
post-final vaccination) in subjects who received three doses of gE/AS01B vaccine (Months 0, 2 
and 6) in comparison to subjects who received placebo, in ART and non-ART cohorts 
presenting high CD4 counts at enrolment. 
•  Results of cell-mediated immunogenicity 
In the gE/AS01B group, the observed median frequency of gE-specific CD4[2+] T cells (per 106 total 
CD4 T cells) at Month 7 was: 2546.4 for the ART High CD4 cohort, 12547.8 for the ART Low CD4 
cohort, and 861.2 for the Non-ART High CD4 cohort. In the Placebo group, the observed Median 
frequency of gE-specific CD4[2+] T cells (per 106 total CD4 T cells) varied by cohort between 84.3 and 
161.7 at month 7. Overall HZ/su induced robust gE-specific CMI vs. placebo whatever the cohort but 
no meaningful conclusions can be drawn on cohort-specific results due to the limited number of 
subjects. 
The superiority of HZ/su compared to placebo in terms of the gE-specific CMI response one month 
after the third vaccination was demonstrated in subjects with high CD4 T cell count (ART+ and ART-
naïve sbjs together), but could not be demonstrated in high CD4 T cell count ART-naïve subjects as too 
few subjects with valid results were included in this cohort.   
•  Results of humoral immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity analysis was performed on the ATP cohort (primary analysis) and on the TVC. The 
analysis of immunogenicity by HIV status (ART High CD4, ART Low CD4, non-ART High CD4 cohorts) 
was performed on the ATP cohort for immunogenicity.  
The superiority of gE/AS01B compared to placebo was demonstrated with respect to the gE specific 
humoral immune response at Month 7 (one month after the third vaccination) in subjects with high 
CD4 T cell count (≥200 cells/mm3 for subjects on ART and ≥500 cells/mm3 for ART-naïve subjects) at 
enrolment (LL of the 90% CI on the GM ratio [HZ/su group /Placebo group] was greater than 3) (Table 
37).

The superiority of gE/AS01B compared to placebo was demonstrated in terms of the gEspecific humoral 
immune response one month after the third vaccination in the ART High CD4 and non-ART High CD4 
cohorts (see table 38: LL of the 90% CI on the GM ratio [HZ/su /Placebo group] was greater than 1).

•  Persistence of immune responses 
Data showed that gE-specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses persisted in the gE/AS01B 
group at Month 18 (1 year post third vaccination) relative to pre-vaccination levels. GMC of anti-gE abs 
at Month 18 in all subjects in the ATP cohort for persistence were 25.242.2 mIU/mL (95% CI: 
19,618.9; 32,477.3) vs. 1237.2 mIU/mLl (95% CI: 890.7 1718.4) pre-vaccination. Placebo GMCs in all 
subjects were 904 mIU/mL ((95% CI: 585.0 1397.0) pre-vaccination and 918 mIU/mL (95% CI: 588.0 
1433.1) at Month 18. In the gE/AS01B group, the observed Median frequency of gE-specific CD4[2+] 
T-cells per 106 total CD4 T-cells (i.e. background subtracted) was 1533.0 at Month 18 and 112.8 at 
Month 0. In the Placebo group, the observed Median frequency of gE-specific CD4[2+] T-cells was 71.8 
at Month 18 and 52.1 at Month 0. 
•  Conclusion from study ZOSTER-015 
The 3-dose gE/AS01B regimen elicited robust humoral and cellular immune responses in HIV+ adult 
subjects, whatever the cohort (ART High CD4 cohort, ART Low CD4 cohort, Non-ART High CD4 cohort). 
Responses tended to be stronger in the ‘ART High CD4’ cohort. However, the number of subjects with 
low CD4 levels was low, and does not allow to firmly conclude for this group. Strong responses were 
observed after two doses. The third dose still induced an increase in anti-gE levels, but this increase 
was marginal for gE specific CD4[2+] T cells. gE-specific humoral and CMI responses persisted in the 
vaccine group at Month 18 (1 year post third vaccination) relative to pre-vaccination levels. Results 
also showed that HZ/su induced robust VZV-specific CMI and humoral responses in HIV infected 
subjects (not shown). 
Overall, responses were of the same magnitude as those found in immunocompetent individuals in 
other studies. 
2.5.5.  Supportive studies 
2.5.5.1.  ZOSTER-007 
Study Title: A phase III, randomized, double blind multicentre study, to evaluate consistency, 
immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of 3 lots of HZ/su candidate vaccine when administered 
intramuscularly on a 0 and 2 month schedule to adults ≥50 years of age. 
•  Objectives and endpoints 
The primary objective of the trial was to demonstrate lot-to-lot consistency in terms of anti-gE humoral 
immunogenicity between three production lots of the HZ/su vaccine one month after the second dose 
(Month 3). The primary endpoint was anti-gE antibody concentration, as determined by ELISA, at 
Month 3. The criteria for consistency was defined as follows: one month after the second dose, the 
Assessment report

two-sided 95%CI of the geometric mean concentration (GMC) ratio between all pairs of lots are to be 
within [0.67, 1.5]. 
The main secondary objective was to demonstrate the consistency of three manufacturing lots of 
HZ/su vaccine in terms of vaccine response rates one month after the second vaccine dose. For this 
objective the criteria for consistency was defined as follows: for each pair-wise comparison, the 2-
sided 95%CI on the lot difference in vaccine response rate (VRR) to the HZ/su vaccine (in terms of the 
humoral anti-gE immune response) one month after the second vaccine dose are to be within the [-
10%; +10%] margin. This secondary objective was assessed in a hierarchical manner. 
•  Study design 
Generally healthy subjects ≥50 years of age were randomized (1:1:1) to the three groups (HZ/su Lot 
A, HZ/su Lot B, HZ/su Lot C). The randomisation algorithm used a minimisation procedure accounting 
for centre, age (50-59 YOA, 60-69 YOA and ≥ 70 YOA) and country. Each group had to comprise 217 
subjects. 
The subjects received one of three production lots of the HZ/su vaccine, each composed of unique 
randomized combinations of antigen and adjuvant lots, at 0 and 2 months.  
The study was double-blind. 
•  Study results 
A total of 651 enrolled subjects received at least 1 dose of vaccine (TVC) and 622 subjects (95.5% of 
the TVC) were included in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity. The main reason for exclusion from the 
ATP was ‘no vaccine administration at Visit 2 Month 2’. 
For the TVC, mean age was 64.5±9.0 years at the time of the first vaccination. There were 55.3% 
females overall. The demographic characteristics were similar for the ATP cohort for immunogenicity. 
The groups were similar with respect to age. The proportion of females was slightly higher in Lot B 
relative to the other lots. 
The primary analysis was based on the ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity. A second 
complimentary analysis based on the TVC was performed since the percentage of vaccinated subjects 
with serological results excluded from the ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity was more than 
5% (14/216) in Lot C. 
Anti-gE abs GMCs by ELISA adjusted for baseline concentration (adjusted GMC) were as follows (ATP 
cohort for immunogenicity): 
 
 
 
In HZ/su Lot A group: 59,263.5 mIU/mL (95%CI: 54,504.0-64,438.5). 
In HZ/su Lot B group: 61,033.6 mIU/mL (95%CI: 56,132.0-66,363.3). 
In HZ/su Lot C group: 62,053.6 mIU/mL (95%CI: 57,132.6-67,398.5). 
The lot-to-lot consistency in terms of anti-gE humoral immunogenicity between the 3 manufacturing 
lots of the HZ/su vaccine one month post-dose 2 was demonstrated as all 95% CIs of the GMC ratios 
between all pairs of lots were within [0.67, 1.5], as shown below: 
  Lot A over Lot B: 0.97 (95%CI: 0.86 1.09). 
  Lot A over Lot C: 0.96 (95%CI: 0.85 1.08). 
  Lot B over Lot C: 0.99 (95%CI: 0.88 1.10). 
Vaccine response rate in terms of the anti-gE antibody ELISA concentrations at one month post-dose 2 
were 95.7%, 97.6% and 97.5% respectively in Lot A group, Lot B group and Lot C group.

EMA/88588/2018

The secondary confirmatory objective for consistency of the 3 manufacturing lots of HZ/su vaccine in 
terms of VRR one month post-dose 2 was met as for each pair-wise comparison, the 2-sided 95% CIs 
on the lot difference in VRR to the HZ/su vaccine (in terms of the humoral anti-gE immune response) 
were within the [-10%; +10%] margin: 
  Lot A minus Lot B: -1.90 (-5.86, 1.72), 
  Lot A minus Lot C: -1.81 (-5.79, 1.92), 
  Lot B minus Lot C: 0.09 (-3.30, 3.58). 
The results were similar for the TVC cohort. 
•  Conclusions for study ZOSTER-007 
Variability in production process of the final formulation of HZ/su does not pose specific issue. The lots 
used in the clinical trials are deemed representative of the commercial batches. The number of three 
lots examined in this Lot-to-Lot consistency study is thus considered as sufficient.  
The criteria for concluding comparability between lots was pre-defined and based on anti-gE antibody 
(primary immunological endpoints throughout the development of HZ/su), which is endorsed. In this 
study, the consistency of the 3 manufacturing lots of HZ/su vaccine was demonstrated with respect to 
anti-gE GMC ratios and VRR. Differences between groups with respect to anti-gE were actually very 
small. Given the absence of correlate of protection the clinical relevance of the observed differences 
remains uncertain. However, the clinical impact of such differences is likely to be negligible. 
Anti-gE antibody ELISA GMCs measured for the 3 lots were similar to those observed in study ZOSTER-
006. 
2.5.5.2.  ZOSTER-004  3 
Study title: A phase III, randomized, open-label, multicentre clinical trial to assess the immunogenicity 
and safety of HZ/su vaccine when co-administered with quadrivalent influenza vaccine FLU D-QIV 
versus separate administration of the two vaccines in adults aged 50 years and older. 
The immunogenicity of FLU-D-QIV when co-administered with HZ/su was also assessed. The study was 
conducted in Canada, Germany and the United States.  
A total of 828 adults ≥50 YOA were enrolled and randomized 1:1 to either receive i) one dose of HZ/su 
and one dose of FLU-D-QIV at Month 0, while a second dose of HZ/su was administered at Month 2 
(Co-ad group) or ii) one dose of FLU-D-QIV at Month 0, while 2 doses of HZ/su were administered at 
Months 2 and 4 (Control group). The mean age was 63.4 YOA (range: 50 to 92 YOA).  
The ATP cohort for immunogenicity included 781 subjects and the demographic characteristics were 
acceptable and similar to the TVC. 
•  Study objectives 
Primary Objectives 
  To evaluate the vaccine response rate (VRR) to the HZ/su (based on the humoral immune 
response) one month after the last vaccine dose in the HZ/su-FLU-D-QIV co-administration 
group. 
3 Report Amendment 2 (117036)

  To demonstrate non-inferiority in terms of humoral immune response of two doses of the 
HZ/su when FLU-D-QIV vaccine is co-administered with the first HZ/su dose, compared to two 
doses of HZ/su given alone, one month after the last vaccine dose. 
  To demonstrate non-inferiority (in terms of HI antibody GMTs) of one dose of FLUD-QIV 
vaccine when co-administered with the first HZ/su dose compared to one dose of FLU-D-QIV 
vaccine given alone, for the four strains included in FLU-DQIV vaccine, at Day 21 post 
vaccination. 
All co-primary objectives needed to be met. Therefore, no adjustment was needed for the type I error 
of each primary comparison. 
Secondary Objectives 
  To demonstrate non-inferiority (in terms of HI antibody SCRs) of one dose of FLUD-QIV 
vaccine when co-administered with the first HZ/su dose compared to one dose of FLU-D-QIV 
vaccine given alone, for the four strains included in FLU-DQIV vaccine, at Day 21 post 
vaccination. 
  To assess the immunogenicity of FLU-D-QIV vaccine in terms of GMTs, SPR at Days 0 and 21 
and SCR and Mean Geometric Increase (MGI) at Day 21. The assessment of SPR and SCR was 
based on US FDA criteria [The lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for SCR should be 
≥40% in subjects aged 18-64 YOA or ≥30% in subjects ≥65 YOA; The lower limit of the 95% 
confidence interval for SPR should be ≥70% in subjects aged 18-64 YOA or ≥60% in subjects 
≥65 YOA.] 
  To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity following administration of HZ/su and FLU-D-QIV 
vaccines, up to one month post last vaccination, and during the whole follow-up period. 
• 
Immunogenicity results 
All co-primary objectives were met: 
  The objective with respect to VRR was met as the LL of the 95% CI of the VRR for anti-gE Ab 
concentrations in the HZ/su-FLU D-QIV co-administration group was 93.3% which was greater 
than the pre-defined criteria of >60%.  
  The non-inferiority of HZ/su co-administered with FLU-D-QIV compared to HZ/su administered 
alone with respect to GMCs for anti-gE antibodies was demonstrated as the UL of the 95% CI 
for the GMC ratio of the Control group over the HZ/su-FLU D-QIV co-administration group was 
1.2 which was below the pre-defined criteria for non-inferiority of ≤1.5. 
  The non-inferiority of FLU-D-QIV (all four strains) co-administered with HZ/su compared to 
FLU-D-QIV administered alone with respect to GMTs for anti-HI antibodies was demonstrated 
as the UL of the two-sided 95% CI for the GMT ratio of the Control group over the HZ/su-FLU 
D-QIV co-administration group was 1.2 which was below the pre-defined criteria for non-
inferiority of ≤1.5. 
The secondary objective of the non-inferiority of FLU-D-QIV (all four strains) coadministered with 
HZ/su compared to FLU-D-QIV administered alone with respect HI antibody SCRs was partially met 
since the UL of the two-sided 95% CI for the SCR difference of the Control group minus the HZ/su-FLU 
D-QIV co-administration group was above the pre-defined non-inferiority criterion of 10% for the strain 
B/Victoria (12.49%) but was below that criterion for strains A/H1N1 (7.35%), A/H3N2 (6.57%), 
B/Yamagata (4.31%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 120/170 
 
  
The US FDA criteria for the HI antibodies SPR were met for all FLU D-QIV vaccine strains in both age 
groups and in both treatment groups, as the LL of the 95% CI for SPR was ≥ 70% in subjects aged 50-
64 years of age and was ≥ 60% in subjects ≥65 years of age for all strains. 
The US FDA criteria for the HI antibodies SCR were only reached in both age groups and in both 
treatment groups for the H1N1 strain, since the LL of the 95% CI for SCR was ≥ 40% in subjects aged 
50-64 years of age and was ≥30% in subjects ≥65 years of age for that strain. In subjects 50-64 YOA, 
the US FDA criteria for SCR were also reached for the B/Victoria strain in the control group and for the 
B/Yamagata strain in the Co-ad group. In subjects ≥65 YOA, the US FDA criterion for SCR was not 
reached for any strains other than the H1N1 strain in any of the treatment groups. 
2.5.5.3.  ZOSTER-026  
Study title: A phase III, randomised, open-label, multicentre, clinical trial to assess the safety and 
immunogenicity of HZ/su vaccine when administered intramuscularly according to a 0,2-month 
schedule, a 0,6-month schedule or a 0,12-month schedule in adults aged 50 years or older. 
•  Co-Primary objectives 
1.  To evaluate vaccine response rate (VRR) for anti-gE humoral immune responses at one month 
post-dose 2 in the 0,6-month and 0,12-month schedule groups. 
Criterion to be used: The lower limit of the 97,5% confidence interval (CI) of the VRR for anti-gE 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antibody concentrations at one month post-dose 2 in the 
0,6-month or 0,12-month schedule groups is at least 60%. 
If the objective above is met, the following objective will be evaluated: 
2.  To demonstrate the non-inferiority in terms of anti-gE humoral immune response one month 
post-dose 2 given according to a 0,6- or a 0,12-month schedule compared to a 0,2-month 
schedule. 
Criterion for non-inferiority: The upper limit of the 97,5% CI for the anti-gE ELISA geometric mean 
concentration (GMC) ratio (0,2-month schedule over 0,6- or 0,12-month schedule) at one month post-
dose 2 is below 1.5. 
•  Study methods 
This was a phase III, open-label, randomised, multicentre study with three parallel groups conducted 
at sites in the US and Estonia in 2013-2015. Generally healthy male or female eligible subjects aged 
50 years or older were randomised to group Gr0-2, Gr0-6 or Gr0-12 according to a 1:1:1 ratio. 
Subjects in each group were stratified by age with a minimum of 35 subjects in each stratum (50-59 
YOA, 60-69 YOA and ≥ 70 YOA strata). Target enrolment was approximately 354 eligible subjects in 
order to have a sample size of 300 evaluable subjects (100 subjects per group).   
The vaccination schedules were as follows: one dose of HZ/su vaccine at Visit Day 0 and one dose at 
Visit Month 2 or Month 6 or Month 12 in the respective groups Gr0-2, Gr0-6 or Gr0-12. The total 
duration of the study was approximately: 14, 18 and 24 months for groups Gr0-2, Gr0-6 and Gr0-12 
respectively.  
•  Study results 
A total of 354 subjects were randomised and vaccinated according to 3 groups (119 in Gr0-2, 119 in 
Gr0-6, 116 in Gr0-12). The mean age was 64.2 ±8.9 years at the time of the first vaccination, and age

was similar across groups. There were slightly more females in the Gr0-2 group (75.6%) as compared 
to the Gr0-6 group (64.7%) and the Gr0-12 (68.1%) 
Of the 354 subjects in the TVC, 343 subjects were included in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity and 
342 subjects were included in the ATP cohort for persistence. A primary analysis for 
safety/immunogenicity was done when all subjects had completed one month follow-up after the last 
vaccine dose for each group. An end of study analysis was done when all subjects had completed 12 
months follow-up after the last vaccine dose for each group. 
•  Confirmatory analyses 
The co-primary objectives to evaluate VRR for anti-gE humoral immune responses at one month post-
dose 2 in the 0,6-month and 0,12-month schedule groups were met as shown in the Table below.

•  Estimation of vaccine efficacy based on the CoP Dunning model 
To further substantiate the clinical significance of the data from ZOSTER-026, the Applicant was asked 
during the procedure to predict the efficacy of the 0, 6-month (and 0, 2-month) schedule based on the 
anti-gE ELISA concentration one month post-dose 2 observed in ZOSTER-026 study using the 
Correlate of Protection Dunning model (refer to section 2.5.3 on the Correlate of protection). The 
results are presented here below: 
The efficacy estimates predicted by the model are very similar (point estimates respectively 93% and 
92%), and also very close to the vaccine efficacy data of the ZOSTER-006 trial.      
•  Conclusion for Study ZOSTER-026 
No efficacy data was generated for the 0, 6-month schedule. Non-inferiority in terms of anti-gE 
humoral immune response one month post-dose 2 was demonstrated for the 0,6-month schedule 
compared to a 0,2-month schedule (primary endpoints met), although GMCs were slightly lower for the 
0,6-month schedule. 
The primary objective was met if the lower limit (LL) of the protocol-defined confidence interval (CI) of 
the VRR for post Dose 2 anti-gE ELISA Ab concentrations was equal to or above a threshold of 60%. 
The optimal threshold (i.e., 4-fold increase of the anti-gE Ab concentrations) that discriminates a ‘non-
responder’ population from a ‘responder’ population was defined using Receiver Operation 
Characteristic (ROC) curves. The ROC curve analysis was not intended to define the “adequate” 
vaccine-induced protective response, but the fold increase over pre-vaccination in humoral anti-gE 
ELISA responses that best balances the specificity and sensitivity in the ability to separate the vaccine 
responses post Dose 2 from placebo individual responses. The 60% criterion was selected as it was 
considered as an acceptable percentage of subjects who meet the definition of a vaccine responder. 
The rationale behind the criteria used to evaluate the primary objectives of ZOSTER-026 is endorsed. 
Assessment report

No comparability data on CMI were generated for the 0, 6-month schedule vs 0, 2-month schedule. 
There is no clinically validated general correlate of protection for HZ/su. CMI responses are considered 
key in the prevention of VZV reactivation. The Applicant has opted for using anti-gE antibody ELISA 
concentrations GMCs for their co-primary endpoint, which is acknowledged. However, given the 
importance of CMI, the demonstration of the non-inferiority of the 0,6-month schedule compared to a 
0,2-month schedule in terms of gE-specific CMI would have been reassuring. 
The Applicant justified how a change of timing of the second doses could affect the CMI responses, 
based on theoretical considerations and on limited experience with this vaccine and with other AS01 
vaccines. This evidence suggests that a gE-specific CD4 T cell memory response is already established 
after 1 dose of HZ/su. After a high level of proliferation, the antigen-specific CD4 T cells differentiate 
into memory cells that could persist for at least 10 months after a single administration of 100 µg 
gE/AS01B. Thus, the recall response to the second dose of HZ/zu can be established at 6 months after 
the first dose. Whether the recall responses will be in the same range as established for a 0, 2 month 
schedule cannot be concluded at the moment. The Applicant thus provided some data suggesting that 
the CMI recall responses could be elicited upon a second dose of HZ/su given at either Month 2 or 6.  
Although the data presented are limited, they are consistent with the concept that increasing the 
interval between vaccine doses generally does not impair the immune responses to live and inactivated 
vaccines. The justification provided by the Applicant is considered as credible and relevant.  
The Applicant was asked to substantiate the clinical significance of the data from the ZOSTER-026 
based on their CoP Dunning model (predicted efficacy of the 0,6 schedule based on the anti-gE ELISA 
concentration one month post-dose 2 observed in ZOSTER-026 study). In addition, the Applicant has 
estimated the predicted efficacy of the 0, 2-month schedule, based on the anti-gE data generated in 
the ZOSTER-026 study. Both predicted efficacy estimated by the model are very similar (point 
estimates and 95% CI respectively 93.1% (90.8%-95.3%) and 92.0% (89.6%-94.4%)), and also very 
close to the vaccine efficacy data of the ZOSTER-006 trial. 
Overall, the inclusion of the 0,6 month schedule in the SmPC is considered acceptable based on the 
available data. However, due to the limitations of these data, the SmPC should refer to the 0,2 month 
schedule as preferable. If flexibility in the vaccination schedule is necessary, the second dose can be 
administered between 2 and 6 months after the first dose.  
2.5.5.4.  ZOSTER-033 
This phase III, non-randomized, open-label, multi-center clinical trial assessed the immunogenicity and 
safety of HZ/su when administered intramuscularly on a 0 and 2 Month schedule to adults ≥50 YOA 
with a prior episode of HZ (physician-documented). This study was conducted 2013/2014 in Canada 
and the Russian Federation. The target enrolment was approximately 96 eligible subjects to provide 84 
subjects evaluable for immunogenicity. Subjects were stratified by age: 50- 59 YOA; 60-69 YOA and 
≥70 YOA. The Applicant used historical controls in ZOSTER-033, but no formal analysis was performed 
with historical controls.  
In ZOSTER-033, the immunogenicity of HZ/su in subjects with previous HZ was determined based on 
the humoral vaccine response rate (VRR) in terms of anti-gE ELISA Abs as the primary objective. The 
VRR was defined the percentage of subjects who have at least a 4-fold increase in post Dose 2 Ab 
concentration over pre-vaccination for seropositive subjects at baseline (or above the cut-off value for 
seropositivity for seronegative subjects at baseline).   
The primary objective in ZOSTER-033 was met if the lower limit (LL) of the protocol-defined confidence 
interval (CI) of the VRR for post Dose 2 anti-gE ELISA Ab concentrations was equal to or above a 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018

threshold of 60%. The optimal threshold (i.e., 4-fold increase of the anti-gE Ab concentrations) that 
discriminates a ‘non-responder’ population from a ‘responder’ population was defined using Receiver 
Operation Characteristic (ROC) curves. The ROC curve analysis was not intended to define the 
“adequate” vaccine-induced protective response, but the fold increase over pre-vaccination in humoral 
anti-gE ELISA responses that best balances the specificity and sensitivity in the ability to separate the 
vaccine responses post Dose 2 from placebo individual responses. The 60% criterion was selected as it 
was considered as an acceptable percentage of subjects who meet the definition of a vaccine 
responder. The justification for the criteria used to evaluate the immunogenicity primary objective of 
the study was accepted. 
In this study, it was shown that the humoral immune response obtained at Month 3 after 2 doses of 
HZ/su administered 2 months apart in adults aged ≥50 years with a prior history of HZ is consistent 
with that seen in studies conducted with HZ/su in older adults without a documented history of HZ 
(VRR and anti-gE antibody concentration). The anti-gE GMC at 1 month after the last vaccine dose was 
47,758.7 mIU/mL (95% CI: 42,258.8; 53,974.4) and the median fold increase of anti-gE 
concentrations from pre-vaccination was 25.6 (Q1: 10.2; Q3: 43.8). The vaccine response rate (anti-
gE antibodies) at 1 month post-vaccination was 90.2% (95% CI: 81.7; 95.7).  
Pre-vaccination GMCs were higher in subjects who had within the last 4 years an episode of HZ 
compared to subjects with HZ-episodes 5 to 10 years ago. The VRRs 14.5 were to be lowest in 
participants with more recent HZ episodes (within 4 years prior to vaccination) compared to 35.8 (5 to 
9 years) and 38.9 (more than 10 years). However no apparent differences were noticed in anti-gE 
antibody concentrations after 2 doses of HZ/su in subjects with history of HZ.  
During this study, 9 suspected HZ cases were reported in 6 participants until Month 14 (6.3%) which 
was higher than the recurrence rate reported in the literature (up to 6.2% over a 7.3 year follow-up 
period) especially in the context of the 97.2% efficacy shown in a phase III clinical trial in adults aged 
50 years and older. As the study was not designed to formally evaluate HZ recurrence (uncontrolled 
study with a limited sample size and no laboratory confirmation of the cases), conclusions regarding 
this specific aspect of the study have to be considered with caution. Further investigation is needed 
(see section 2.5.6). 
2.5.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
•  Study design and conduct 
The pivotal studies ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 were randomised placebo controlled safety and 
efficacy trials of nearly identical study design. Beside the age of the subjects, the only other difference 
was that only subjects enrolled into ZOSTER-006 study were randomly allocated to be part of the CMI 
investigations as exploratory endpoint. Studies were adequately designed. The use of a saline placebo 
was justified as an active comparator was not yet commercially available at the time of the studies. 
The randomisation, stratification and minimization techniques used to ensure balance between groups 
with respect to age, site and country are deemed appropriate. A few study sites in Mexico had 
significant GCP violation or incorrectly applied the informed consent process, accounting to 4.21% 
(680/16,160) of the totally enrolled subjects in ZOSTER-006 and 5.84% (865/14,816) in ZOSTER-022. 
In total, 4.75% of the enrolled in ZOSTER-006 and 6.50% in ZOSTER-022 were excluded from TVC 
analyses; this is unlikely to have affected results.

Apart from immunosuppressive conditions, common comorbidities were not excluded from the trials. 
The collection of baseline medical conditions relied on the medical history performed at baseline by the 
Investigator, i.e. standardised definitions and scores of co-morbidities should be considered in future 
studies. The analysis of the medical history data suggests that groups are balanced for common 
conditions, including a range of diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 
chronic kidney disease (CKD), depression, and diabetes that affect the risk of HZ and PHN. This 
indicates that efficacy estimates in the pivotal trials are unlikely to be biased by imbalance in the pre-
existing medical conditions.  
•  Target population 
The target population for HZ/su (adults 50 YOA and older) is known to have many comorbid 
conditions, of which the most frequent ones as reported in the literature are cardiovascular diseases, 
cancer, pulmonary disease (including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), hypertension and 
diabetes. Although certain comorbidities were included in the trials (in total approximately 13,000 
subjects with underlying medical conditions from the 2 studies), and exclusion criteria were not very 
restrictive, it was considered that specific subpopulations may be underrepresented in the trials, e.g. 
frail elderly including those with multiple comorbidities, and that overall the population studied may 
have been healthier than the general population that is the target of vaccination. In addition the 
baseline status should have been more thoroughly characterised (e.g. accounting for frailty). The 
potential impact on the external validity of the study findings was discussed in the course of the 
procedure, including the need to conduct further studies post-authorisation. Based on a number of 
observations, it was concluded that the impact on the study findings is not a concern and relevant 
uncertainties in specific subgroups can be followed up post-authorisation (for details refer to the 
section on subpopulations of interest in this chapter). Overall the target population was adequately 
selected to support an age-based indication, i.e. adults 50 years of age and above. 
•  Study endpoints 
Clinical efficacy was assessed in ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 using the same methodology in both 
studies over a follow-up period of 3-4 years. The primary endpoint in both studies was the detection of 
HZ events and their virological confirmation, which is relevant. Study procedures to ascertain these 
endpoints are carefully designed.  
A suspected case of HZ was defined as new unilateral rash accompanied by pain (broadly defined to 
include allodynia, pruritus or other sensations) and no alternative diagnosis. Subjects clinically 
diagnosed as having a suspected case of HZ by the investigator were referred to as a case of 
‘suspected HZ’. The HZ onset date was defined as the earlier of the following two events: 1) the HZ 
rash start date; or 2) the date on which pain at the site of a subsequent HZ rash is first noted. The end 
date of a HZ episode was defined as the first time at which a subject had no rash (papules, vesicles, 
ulcers or crusts) present. Severe ‘worst’ pain was defined as HZ-associated pain rated as 3 or greater 
on the ‘worst pain’ ZBPI question.  
Secondary endpoints in both studies included the detection of PHN, HZ-related complications (other 
than PHN), mortality and hospitalizations, and use of pain medication. However, the analysis in these 
studies was not powered to demonstrate PHN VE, since, in view of the assumptions taken for VE, the 
sample size in each study should have been much larger. Therefore, PHN VE was assessed based on 
the pre-specified pooled analyses as a co-primary endpoint, i.e. HZ and PHN VE in subjects ≥70 YOA. 
Studies were not adequately powered to demonstrate VE against PHN in subjects with a confirmed 
case of HZ. 
PHN was defined as the presence of HZ-associated severe ‘worst’ pain persisting or appearing more 
than 90 days after onset of the HZ rash. Alternative definitions of PHN, based on duration of pain of 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 126/170 
 
  
30, 60, 120 and 180 days were also used for reporting purposes. Overall, it is unlikely that persisting 
pain has been missed as subjects with suspected HZ had to complete the ZBPI questionnaire until they 
had no HZ-associated pain for 4 consecutive weeks. There is no international standard regarding the 
exact definition of PHN, and variations in PHN case definitions influence the estimates of PHN 
incidence, as described by the Applicant. It is agreed that the pivotal studies used a more specific case 
definition compared to those described in a recent systematic review of PHN: most studies defined PHN 
as a (neuropathic) pain persisting beyond 3-4 months after the onset of the herpetic rash, i.e. no 
“worst” pain nor score cut-off was used as criteria.  
The protocol procedures are particularly well designed to assess the pain over the acute phase (the 4 
initial weeks); in particular the Zoster Brief Pain Inventory (ZBPI) is considered appropriate to assess 
HZ pain. After Day 28 post HZ onset, the ZBPI was completed weekly by the subjects (in contrast with 
daily completion during the initial 4-week period). Information on HZ-associated pain is derived from 
the ZBPI ‘worst pain’ question for the ascertainment of BOI and PHN. It is acknowledged that HZ BOI 
(which is determined by the mean AUC of the severity-by-duration HZ associated pain during a 26 
week period following the onset of the HZ rash) is valid despite fluctuations in daily ZBPI worst pain 
scores over time. Overall reliability of weekly pain assessment based on ZBPI past the initial 4-week 
period is endorsed. 
After Visit 3 (Month 1 post vaccination 2), monthly contacts between the subjects and the investigator 
had to take place (except at months that coincide with the subject’s scheduled visits) in order to collect 
information on any event of interest that may have occurred. Appropriate instructions were provided to 
the investigator and delegate to ensure accurate collection of long term data and to appropriately 
capture the relevant data up to study end.  
Overall, the presentation of exploratory endpoints related to pain severity, duration, and quality of life 
did not seem to be fully consistent with endpoints previously defined in the study protocol (ex. burden-
of-interference). The Applicant acknowledged that the protocol description of the quality of life (QoL) 
analysis was vague and has therefore clarified and detailed all QoL-related analysis in the 
corresponding statistical analysis plan (SAP) QoL, which was internally approved prior to unblinding 
and conduct of analysis. 
•  Early termination of pivotal studies 
Since the VE against HZ at final analysis of ZOSTER-006 was substantially higher than anticipated, and 
assuming that the VE in ≥70 YOA in ZOSTER-022 (randomized at the same sites and time in all 
participating countries) would be similar to that obtained at final analysis in ZOSTER-006, the Applicant 
proposed stopping both studies ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 earlier than initially planned. Subjects 
in the Placebo group could then be offered HZ/su under the cross-vaccination protocol (ZOSTER-056) 
at the earliest possible time point. This decision was made to minimise the risk of the placebo 
recipients developing HZ and its complications, such as PHN. At the data lock point, the pre-specified 
number of HZ and PHN cases was reached in both studies, and the scientific integrity of the studies 
was not impacted by the early termination. This was also the conclusion of the IDMC that reviewed the 
unblinded final HZ/su efficacy data and unblinded available safety data of ZOSTER-006 before trial 
termination. 
•  Statistical aspects 
All analysis in ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 were conducted according to the as-treated principle, 
although analyses according to the intention-to-treat principle are requested for all primary and key 
secondary hypotheses as this is the primary analysis set as requested by the “Guideline on Clinical 
Evaluation of new Vaccines” (EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/2005). This is however acceptable as overall it 
is agreed that the ITT analyses are in line with the TVC analyses. Only very few randomization errors 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 127/170 
 
  
occurred. Concerns related to the multiple testing strategy and to the description and strategy of the 
interim analysis were clarified during the assessment and are believed not to have impacted the 
interpretation of the study results, also in light of the size of the treatment effect. 
•  Conclusions on study design 
Overall, ZOSTER-006, ZOSTER-022, and their pre-specified pooled analyses thus addressed the most 
relevant clinical questions and overall the objectives and endpoints are endorsed. Methods, conduct, 
analysis and reporting of results from the main studies are considered appropriate. The study design is 
in accordance with legal requirements, available guidelines and scientific advice previously given. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
•  Efficacy against Herpes Zoster (HZ) 
In two phase III, placebo-controlled, observer-blind efficacy studies (ZOSTER-006 in 15,405 
randomised adults ≥ 50 years and ZOSTER-022 in 13,900 randomised adults ≥70 years), strikingly 
high efficacy levels were obtained with HZ/Su. 
In subjects ≥50 YOA at the final efficacy analysis, the overall VE against HZ was 97.2 [95% CI: 93.7-
99.0]) in the modified Total Vaccinated Cohort (mTVC), i.e. excluding adults who did not receive the 
second dose of vaccine or who had a confirmed diagnosis of HZ within one month after the second 
dose, over a mean follow-up period of 3.1 years. This resulted in only few breakthrough cases in the 
HZ/su group (6 vs. 210 cases in placebo). VE was very consistent across age categories, gender, 
regions as well as cohorts of analysis and statistical models. VE against HZ was slightly higher <70 
YOA as compared to ≥70 YOA. More detailed analyses across age categories (such as VE against PHN 
by age, VE again HZ over time by age, VE above 80 YOA) were assessed in the pooled analysis.  
Very high VE against HZ in the ≥70 YOA was confirmed in ZOSTER-022 [89.79% (95% CI: 84.29% to 
93.66%; p<0.0001)] and re-estimated in the pooled analysis at 91.30% (95% CI: 86.88%-94.46%) in 
the mTVC. This was based on 25 cases of HZ vs. 284 cases in placebo in the pooled analysis ≥70 YOA. 
Vaccine efficacy against HZ was very similar by age, i.e. 91.27% in the 70-79 YOA and 91.37% in the 
≥80 YOA in pooled analysis. The co-primary objective of the pooled analysis regarding HZ and PHN VE 
in subjects ≥70 YOA was met (see below for results on PHN endpoint).  
Breakthrough cases were very few so the assessment of their clinical and immunological profile even at 
baseline did not show specific common denominator or other aspects that could explain their 
occurrence. 
A sensitivity analysis VE against HZ over time was performed at ZOSTER-006 EOS in ≥50 YOA and on 
pooled ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 data in ≥70 YOA. VE against HZ persisted for at least 4 years in 
both age strata, with estimated efficacy at Year 4 of 93.07% (95% CI: 81.2; 98.2) for subjects ≥50 
YOA and 87.88% (95% CI: 73.3; 95.4) for those ≥70 YOA, in the mTVC. Of note, a longer follow-up of 
vaccine efficacy up to 10 years is ongoing in vaccinated subjects of the ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 
studies, as well as a cross-vaccination study of the placebo groups. The need and timing of booster 
dose(s) will also be assessed in these studies. 
•  Efficacy against Post-Herpetic Neuralgia (PHN) 
Two doses of HZ/su vaccine given on a 0, 2 month schedule produced high protective efficacy against 
post-herpetic neuralgia as a consequence of HZ prevention: 100% efficacy (95% CI 77.1; 100] in 
individuals >50 YOA (ZOSTER-006, no cases of PHN in the vaccine group) as well as by age strata (50-
59 and 60-69 YOA). In the co-primary analysis of the pooled data from ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022, 
the overall VE against PHN occurrence in those ≥70 YOA was 88.78% (95% CI 68.7; 97.1) in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 128/170 
 
  
mTVC (4 cases of PHN occurred in the vaccine group). In the individual studies PHN VE was evaluated 
as a secondary objective and they were not powered for this analysis. However, if the success criteria 
for demonstrating PHN VE in the pooled analysis were to be applied for these age strata, they would be 
met for PHN VE in ≥50 YOA and ≥70 YOA.  
In the pooled analysis, VE against PHN was demonstrated also in the 70-79 YOA (93.04% [95% CI 
72.4; 99.2]; LL of the 95% CI well above 0%. For those ≥80 YOA, firm conclusion could not be drawn 
(VE 71.2% with 95% CI <0; 97.1) likely due to the lower number of subjects reporting PHN episodes, 
but PHN cases were numerically lower in the vaccine group compared to placebo group (2 vs. 7).   
VE against HZ remained high in both studies up to the end of the study (median follow-up time of 4.1 
years in ZOSTER-006 and 3.9 years in ZOSTER-022). More data on the persistence of protection 
against PHN is expected to be generated in long term follow up efficacy studies.   
VE against PHN was estimated also in overall subjects with a confirmed case of HZ ≥50 YOA. This 
analysis was included as a secondary objective in the ZOSTER-006/ZOSTER-022 pooled analysis, 
however it could not be demonstrated in the mTVC cohort (VE 0.29%, p=0.5417). This is reflected in 
the SmPC. Similar results were obtained in TVC and ATP cohorts. Of note, due to the high efficacy of 
HZ/su in preventing HZ, which is the precondition for developing PHN, an unfeasible high sample size 
would have been required to show on top efficacy against PHN, in addition to the PHN efficacy that is 
the direct consequence of prevention of HZ. Therefore, the analysis of PHN prevention in subjects with 
confirmed HZ was not adequately powered. The actual reported PHN cases among confirmed HZ cases 
were 4/32 (12.50%) in the vaccine group and 46/477 (9.64%) in the placebo group, in the mTVC. The 
amount of cases is so low that a conclusion based on these numbers is not possible.   
•  Efficacy against HZ-related complications other than PHN 
A relevant post-hoc analysis suggests that VE against HZ-related complications other than PHN is of 
the same magnitude as the VE against HZ and PHN. In the pooled analysis of ZOSTER-006 and 
ZOSTER-022, the vaccine significantly reduced HZ-related complications (other than PHN) by 93.7% 
(95% CI: 59.5; 99.9) and 91.6% (95% CI: 43.3; 99.8) in adults ≥ 50 years (1 vs. 16 cases) and 
adults ≥ 70 years (1 vs. 12 cases), respectively. The complications observed in the placebo group were 
confined to HZ vasculitis, disseminated disease, neurological disease and ophthalmic disease, and their 
incidence tended to increase with age. No cases of visceral disease or stroke associated with HZ 
reported during the study in either group. The complication reported in the vaccine group was 
ophthalmic disease.  
However, this analysis was of limited power. In addition, these complications are very heterogeneous, 
with various underlying mechanisms and aetio-pathogenesis. More robust data could be needed over a 
larger range of complications and over the long term. To this end, the Applicant is currently conducting 
a feasibility assessment in relevant large healthcare databases already identified to ensure the 
robustness, reliability and interpretability of a post-authorisation effectiveness study.  
Overall, incidence of HZ, PHN and HZ ophthalmicus in the studies were at the lower range of what is 
described in the literature. This could be linked to the relatively healthy and immunocompetent profile 
of the subjects, however the pivotal studies also used more stringent/specific case definitions 
compared to those described in recent literature. Based on a number of elements evaluated during the 
procedure (e.g. relevance and validation of ZBPI tool to measure pain even in an intermittent way), 
underreporting is considered unlikely. Two post-authorisation studies will evaluate long term efficacy 
and immunogenicity of the vaccine in subjects vaccinated in earlier studies, and may provide further 
information on efficacy against PHN or other complications. 
Zoster sine herpete (ZSH) is, albeit uncommon, an increasingly described HZ-related complication; 
however no standard diagnosis tool is available and virological confirmation can be challenging. Given 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 129/170 
 
  
the protocol definition of HZ, ZSH was not collected either as a HZ-complication or as an adverse 
event, so no cases of ZSH have been reported in the trials. This is not considered a major problem 
since there is no reason to believe that the vaccine will not be efficacious against variants of HZ onset, 
such as ZSH. However the definition of HZ in IC clinical studies and other future studies will include 
atypical HZ cases comprising ZSH, so more information may be gathered. 
•  Other secondary endpoints 
No firm conclusion can be drawn on VE in reducing HZ-related mortality and hospitalization, due to 
a low number of breakthrough cases accrued. There were no cases of HZ-related mortality and no HZ-
related hospitalization in subjects >50 YOA (ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022), except for 5 subjects that 
were hospitalised for HZ in the placebo group of ZOSTER-022. 
Similarly, no statistically significant VE in reducing total duration of severe “worst” zoster pain 
was shown in individual studies or in the pooled analysis. However, there was a trend for a shorter 
duration in the vaccine group vs. the placebo group in all analyses, i.e. 11.0 vs. 15.0 days in ≥ 50 YOA 
in ZOSTER-006 (reduction of 27%), 13.5 vs. 19.0 days in ≥ 70 YOA in ZOSTER-022, and 11.5 vs. 19.0 
in ≥ 70 YOA in the pooled analysis (reduction of 30.5%). 
An impact of HZ/su on use of pain medication associated with HZ was demonstrated, although the 
association is of a lower magnitude compared to other endpoints, which is not unexpected given the 
lower specificity of this endpoint. In ZOSTER-022, HZ/su significantly reduced the use and the 
duration of HZ-associated pain medication by 39.60% and 49.25%, respectively, in the mTVC 
confirmed HZ cases (secondary objective met). However, no statistically significant difference was 
observed in ZOSTER-006. A post hoc pooled analysis for the ≥70 YOA was conducted to provide a more 
accurate estimate (reduced use and duration of HZ-related pain medication by 39% (95% CI: 11.9; 
63.3) and 50.6% (95% CI: 8.8; 73.2), respectively). The median duration of pain medication use was 
32.0 and 44.0 days in the vaccine and placebo group, respectively.  
•  Exploratory endpoints  
No  statistically  significant  difference  was  seen  between  vaccine  and  placebo  groups  for  worst  pain 
score measured by ZBPI questionnaires in subjects with at least one confirmed HZ episode in individual 
studies; however in subjects ≥70 years (pooled data), the vaccine significantly reduced the maximum 
worst pain score versus placebo over the entire HZ episode (mean = 5.7 vs. 7.0, P-value = 0.032). In 
addition,  the  vaccine  significantly  reduced  the  maximum  average  pain  score  versus  placebo  over  the 
entire  HZ  episode  (mean  =  3.9  vs.  5.5,  P-value  =  0.049  in  subjects  ≥50  years  (ZOSTER-006),  and 
mean = 4.5 vs. 5.6, P-value = 0.043, in subjects ≥ 70 years (ZOSTER-006 and -022 pooled).  
No  statistically  significant  differences  were  seen  for  the  ZBPI  AUC  analysis  for  worst  pain  score, 
average pain score and activities of daily living (ADL) score. However, there was a trend towards less 
severe zoster pain and higher QoL in vaccinated subjects compared to placebo.  
A post-hoc analysis was performed to assess whether vaccination with HZ/su  can significantly reduce 
the  incidence  of  severe  and  long-lasting  zoster  pain,  e.g.  with  score  of  >600  by  ZBPI,  in  the  studied 
subjects.  The  point  estimates  would  suggest  an  attenuation  of  long  term  severity  in  breakthrough 
cases,  but,  as  cases  are  too  few,  CI  are  wide  so  no  definitive  conclusion  can  be  drawn  (see  section 
2.5.3). 
The burden-of-illness (BOI) score incorporates the incidence of HZ with the severity and duration of 
acute and chronic HZ-related pain over a 6 month period following rash onset. The mean AUC scores 
for severity-of-illness and severity-of-interference evaluated by ZBPI in the mTVC were significantly 
lower in the vaccine group compared to placebo group, overall and in all age strata. The estimated 
overall VE against BOI was 98.4% (95% CI: 92.2; 100) in the mTVC ≥ 50 YOA (ZOSTER-006), and 
92.1% (95% CI: 90.4; 93.8) in mTVC ≥ 70 YOA (pooled analysis of ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022). 
Similar results were seen for VE against burden of interference measured on activities of daily living 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 130/170 
 
  
(ADL) score (99.1%). These relevant data address total pain associated with HZ, and are reflected in 
SmPC.  
Overall, many analysis related to pain scores (pain severity, severity by duration) and interference 
with QoL did not show statistically significant differences between groups because of the small number 
of breakthrough cases in the HZ/su group. Most scores tended to be lower in the HZ/su group than in 
the Placebo group. Notably, there was a statistically significant and favourable impact of HZ/su on BOI 
scores. Overall, these data suggest lower severity of pain and burden of illness and a lower loss of QoL 
in the HZ/su group in subjects with confirmed episode of HZ, and are considered clinically relevant for 
inclusion in the SmPC. 
Immunogenicity data 
The clinical development program demonstrated strong and persistent cellular and humoral immune 
response induced by HZ/su. Evaluation of CMI responses was the primary objective of several Phase 
I/II HZ/su trials, since CMI responses are known to be essential for protection against reactivation of 
VZV and development of HZ. Generally the median frequencies of gE-specific CD4 T-cells one month 
post Dose 2 were consistently high across studies and investigated age strata. The humoral immune 
responses in terms of anti-gE Ab VRRs, GMCs and fold increase over pre-vaccination anti-gE Ab 
concentrations measured by anti-gE ELISA 1 month post Dose 2 are consistently high in all presented 
studies, although mostly more than 99 % of subjects were seropositive at baseline. 
Humoral immune responses to HZ/su were evaluated up until 3 years post-dose 2 (Month 38) in the 
Phase III clinical studies ZOSTER-006 and 022, whilst cellular immune responses were measured only 
in ZOSTER-006.   
In ZOSTER-006, a total of 2,137 subjects ≥50 YOA (13.9% of TVC, of which 1,070 were in the vaccine 
group) were included in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity-Humoral at Month 3 (1 month after Dose 
2). At Month 3, a median fold increase of 41.9 (Q1;Q3 = 20.8; 86.9) in anti-gE ELISA titres was 
observed vs. pre-vaccination titres. The elevated responses persisted up to Month 38 post Dose-1 
(median fold increase of abs concentrations: 9.3 [Q1;Q3 = 4.9; 19.5] vs. pre-vaccination). At Month 3, 
anti-gE GMCs responses were 52,376.6 (95% CI 50,264.1; 54,577.9) as compared to the baseline 
level (1247.1 mIU/mL [95% CI: 1174.8 - 1323.8]) and to placebo (baseline: 1311.9 (95% CI: 
1234.8– 1393.9) mIU/mL; similar results at all time points). At month 3 a median fold increase vs. 
pre-vaccination of 24.6 (Q1;Q3 = 9.9; 74.2) in gE-specific CD4[2+] T cell frequency was observed in 
subjects ≥50 YOA, whilst in subjects  ≥70 YOA was 33.2 (Q1;Q3 = 10.0; 1052.0).      
After peak titres at Month 3, the observed anti-gE antibody responses declined, but GMCs remained to 
be 11,919.6 (95% CI 11,345.6; 12,522.7) at Month 38 post Dose-1. The vaccine response rate (VRR) 
was calculated by the percentage of subjects whose post-dose 2 anti-gE titres had at least a 4-fold 
increase over the assay cut-off value for seropositivity (for subjects seronegative at baseline), or 
whose post-dose 2 anti-gE titres had at least a 4-fold increase above the pre-vaccination titre (for 
subjects seropositive at baseline). In the vaccine group, VRRs were 98.5% (95% CI 97.6; 99.1) at 
Month 3 and 80.9% (95% CI: 78.2%-83.3%) at Month 38.  
In the pooled analysis, a total of 2.936 subjects (of which 2,137 from ZOSTER-006 and 799 from 
ZOSTER-022, of which 387 were in the vaccine group for the latter study) were included in the ATP 
cohort for immunogenicity to evaluate induced humoral responses and persistence in subjects ≥ 50 
YOA and by age strata. In subjects ≥ 70 YOA, 99.3% of subjects were seropositive at pre-vaccination 
(i.e. with abs concentration above the assay cut-off value, ≥97mIU/mL). At Month 3, all subjects were 
seropositive for anti-gE antibody, presenting high GMCs of 49,691.5 (95% CI: 47,250.8 to 52,258.2 
mIU/mL) vs. 1410.7 in placebo, a median fold increase of abs titres vs. pre-vaccination of 34.3 (Q1; 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 131/170 
 
  
Q3 = 16.7; 68.5), and a VRR of 96.6% (95% CI: 95.1% to 97.8%) vs. VRR of 2.5% (95% CI 1.4; 4.0) 
in the placebo group.  
At Month 38, all subjects ≥70 YOA in the pooled analysis remained seropositive for anti-gE antibody in 
the vaccine group, with high GMCs of 10,507.7 (95% CI: 9,899.2 to 11,153.6 mIU/mL), a median fold 
increase of 7.2 (Q1; Q3: 3.5; 14.5) vs. pre-vaccination, and a VRR of 70.5% (95% CI: 66.8% to 
74.0%) vs. 2.4% in the placebo group. The results obtained in 70-79 YOA and ≥80 YOA strata were 
consistent with overall analysis in the ≥70 YOA, with a trend toward decreasing response with 
increasing age. 
The analysis of persistence of humoral responses showed that anti-gE antibody concentrations as well 
as anti-gE specific CD4 T cells decline over the years but remain almost stable from year 4 to year 6, 
with immune responses persisting above pre-vaccination levels for at least up to Month 72 post-
vaccination (i.e. 6 years). At month 72 in ZOSTER-024 (phase II follow up study of ZOSTER-003), the 
median anti-gE antibody concentration was greater than 7-fold above the baseline pre-vaccination 
median concentration. The median frequency of gE-specific CD4[2+] T cells was greater than 3.7-fold 
above baseline pre-vaccination median frequency. 
The potential for exhaustion of the immune system due to the high immune responses induced by 
HZ/su and consequent implications for protection against other pathogens in a population that is 
already experiencing immunosenescence due to age were discussed during the procedure. Based on 
the clinical data observed in the coadministration study and in the IC studies as well as the non-clinical 
data, this phenomenon is considered unlikely both in the healthy and the IC populations. 
•  Additional dosing schedule (0,6 months) 
In a phase III, open-label clinical study (ZOSTER-026), 238 adults ≥50 years of age were equally 
randomised to receive 2 doses of HZ/su 2 or 6 months apart. No efficacy data was generated for the 
0,6 months schedule. The 0,6 months schedule was shown to be non-inferior to the 0,2 months 
schedule in terms of anti-gE humoral immune response one month post-dose 2 (primary endpoints 
met). The anti-gE GMC at 1 month post-dose 2 was 38,153.7 mIU/mL (95% CI: 34,205.8; 42,557.3) 
and the median fold increase of anti-gE concentrations from pre-vaccination was 36.8 (Q1: 17.6; Q3: 
68.4). Anti-gE GMCs were slightly higher for the 0,2-month schedule (44376.3 mIU/mL (95% CI: 
39697.0; 49607.2)). The demonstration of non-inferiority of the 0,12-month schedule was nearly 
missed.  
This immunobridging strategy was sufficiently justified given that the new dosing schedule involves 
similar mechanisms of protection as compared to the pivotal trials. Based on the immunogenicity data, 
the use of the 0,6-months schedule is considered acceptable, although with a preference for the 0,2-
months schedule, due to the limitations mentioned. The SmPC reflects that, if flexibility in the 
vaccination schedule is necessary, the second dose can be administered between 2 and 6 months after 
the first dose. 
•  Coadministration with other vaccines 
In a phase III, controlled, open-label clinical study (ZOSTER-004), 828 adults ≥ 50 years of age were 
randomized to receive 2 doses of HZ/su 2 months apart administered either concomitantly at the first 
dose (N=413) or non-concomitantly (N=415) with an unadjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine. 
Following co-administration of HZ/su with the unadjuvanted influenza vaccine, the anti-gE GMC at 1 
month after the last vaccine dose was 52,860.0 mIU/mL (95% CI: 48,386.3; 57,748.8) and the 
median fold increase of anti-gE concentrations from pre-vaccination was 42.9 (Q1: 17.2; Q3: 90.9). 
The VRR following coadministration of the 2 vaccines was 95.8% (95% CI: 93.3; 97.6). The antibody 
responses to both vaccines were similar, whether administered concomitantly or non-concomitantly.  
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 132/170 
 
  
Based on the results from study ZOSTER-004, HZ/su can be given concomitantly with unadjuvanted 
inactivated influenza vaccine. No data are currently available regarding concomitant use with other 
vaccines. More studies are ongoing to investigate co-administration with Pneumovax 23 (Pneumococcal 
polysaccharide conjugate vaccine), Prevenar 13 and with Boostrix (Diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis 
vaccine). 
•  Correlate of protection analysis 
The investigation to identify a CoP was considered scientifically robust and it indicates that anti-gE 
ELISA Abs may correlate with protection, however many uncertainties remain which prevents to 
conclude on a validated CoP for the time being. Therefore the level of immune response that provides 
protection against HZ is unknown. The SmPC reflects that an immunological correlate of protection has 
not been established. The Applicant is encouraged to continue the CoP development with their 
approach. 
Nevertheless, it is agreed that post-dose 2 anti-gE can be used as immune marker for immunobridging 
in certain circumstances based on demonstration of anti
gE antibodies non-inferiority. However, this 
needs to be assessed on a case
by
case basis, especially considering that the CMI component is 
‐
deemed crucial for protection based on current knowledge.

Subpopulations of interest  
• 
Individuals with comorbidities and frailty 
The studies were not designed to demonstrate efficacy and safety in subgroups of frail individuals, 
including those with multiple comorbidities. Given the target age, certain comorbidities were included 
in the trials and exclusion criteria were not very restrictive but frail patients and those with 
comorbidities are likely to be underrepresented in the pivotal studies, also based on the requirements 
of trial design (e.g. patients affected by psoriasis or chronic pain syndrome or physically impaired may 
not have been included). The finding that incidence of HZ does not increase as expected with age 
provides an additional indirect indication that patients enrolled in ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 are 
likely to be substantially healthier than the population actually targeted by the vaccine (especially the 
oldest age categories), which may limit the external validity of the efficacy/safety results.  
Post-hoc exploratory analysis suggests that VE against HZ is not significantly affected by frequent 
baseline conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, depression and chronic 
kidney disease, as compared to the overall efficacy in the pivotal studies. In addition a robust immune 
response was found in immunocompromised individuals, and all these elements are reassuring with 
respect to external validity of the HZ efficacy findings. Routine pharmacovigilance is therefore 
considered sufficient for post-marketing safety monitoring of HZ/su.  
As the level of efficacy of HZ/su is extremely high in the pivotal trials and consistent according to age 
and common comorbidities as mentioned, there is no reason to believe that VE would be drastically 
lower in frail subjects. Nevertheless use of the vaccine in frail patients is included as missing 
information in the RMP and the limited data is reflected in the SmPC. Two studies (ZOSTER-063 and -
064) are planned in subjects >50 YOA and it is expected that they will provide useful confirmatory 
information in frail subjects, although they will not assess efficacy according to frailty (see also section 
2.7). ZOSTER-063 will allow for the evaluation of reactogenicity according to frailty level. Both studies 
are included in the RMP as a measure to address missing information. 
Post-authorisation effectiveness studies are not expected to lead to any findings that would question 
the benefit-risk balance of the product, but would provide additional perspective on estimates of 
vaccine efficacy against HZ-related complications (taking into account the limitations of conducted 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 133/170 
 
  
clinical studies in this respect) and also may allow for the assessment of vaccine benefits among 
relevant patient subgroups that are otherwise difficult to study in randomized controlled trials such as 
the frail population or specific co-morbidities groups. The Applicant is currently conducting a feasibility 
assessment for a post-authorisation effectiveness study included in the RMP in the context of missing 
information. 
No data are available on efficacy and safety of HZ/su in patients from less prevalent subgroups such as 
patients with pre-existing autoimmune diseases (AIDs) or potentially immune mediated diseases 
(pIMDs) with or without immunosuppressive treatment, for which there is a significant medical need 
due to the high incidence of HZ. This is considered as missing information in the RMP and will be 
followed up post-authorisation in a dedicated immunogenicity and safety study (ZOSTER-069, currently 
under feasibility assessment; see also safety section 2.6). 
• 
Individuals with a history of HZ or previous varicella/zoster vaccination 
These individuals were excluded from the pivotal trials. This is appropriate in order not to bias the 
results by including patients presenting specific immunological profiles. The Applicant has undertaken 
specific trials targeting these subjects (ZOSTER-033 on subjects with a history of HZ, and ZOSTER-048 
on subjects previously vaccinated with Zostavax- the latter not included in this submission). 
In ZOSTER-033, the immune responses induced in adults ≥ 50 years of age with a history of HZ did 
not differ from the HZ/su induced immune responses seen in the other presented studies. Over a one-
year follow-up period 9 reports of suspected HZ were reported in 6 individuals, which might point 
towards a higher recurrence rate than generally reported in observational studies in unvaccinated 
individuals with a history of HZ. In view of the methodological limitations of ZOSTER-033 (limited 
sample size (n=96), non-controlled, no CMI assessment and no laboratory confirmation of HZ cases) 
no firm conclusions could be made, and any hypothesis of HZ/su being ineffective or even triggering 
the recurrence of HZ in these patients is speculative and based on limited observations made with 
other herpes viruses (CMV in particular). For this reason, the risk is only a potential risk that would 
benefit from further investigation (see also safety and RMP sections 2.6.5, 2.6.9 and 2.7). This is 
reflected in the SmPC and in the RMP. Additional evidence regarding use of HZ/su in subjects with a 
history of HZ will be generated in a new study, ZOSTER-062, and in study ZOSTER-056, which is an 
ongoing Phase IIIb, open-label, cross-vaccination study evaluating the safety of HZ/su. In this study, 
subjects who received placebo in the two pivotal studies were offered cross-vaccination with HZ/su 
candidate and followed-up for 12 months post last vaccination, enrolling ~200 subjects with previous 
HZ. A subgroup analysis of the subjects with a history of HZ will be performed.  
The vaccine is proposed for the prevention of zoster, and therefore acts as a booster of pre-existing 
immunity against the natural varicella infection. Currently, it is estimated that the large majority of the 
target population (>95% in Europe) have had a varicella infection and is therefore seropositive. 
However, seroprevalence levels vary by region based on epidemiology of infection and varicella 
vaccination policies. At present, the probability to vaccinate a VZV-seronegative subject in the EU is 
very low, and this probability is not expected to increase over the short term. In this context, and 
based on the absence of theoretical concern, inadvertent vaccination of seronegative subjects is 
deemed as acceptable. In addition, varicella vaccinated individuals could still develop varicella due to 
vaccine failure or vaccine virus becoming latent. The rationale to vaccinate these individuals with 
HZ/su is therefore endorsed. This uncertainty will be followed up post-authorisation via routine 
pharmacovigilance in PSURs. A study investigated the use of HZ/su in individuals previously vaccinated 
with Zostavax (ZOSTER-048). Data have become available only at the end of this procedure therefore 
it will be assessed after authorisation.

• 
Immunocompromised individuals 
The Applicant is conducting a dedicated clinical development plan in immunocompromised adults 
targeting several well-defined sentinel populations. Two completed studies were submitted in this 
application for assessment (ZOSTER-015 in HIV+ patients, and ZOSTER-001 in HCT recipients for a 
total of 135 adults of whom 73 were ≥50 YOA) and four clinical trials are ongoing (solid tumour, 
Autologous HCT recipients, Hematologic malignancy, renal transplant) and will be evaluated in future 
applications.  
In ZOSTER-015, the 3-dose HZ/su regimen elicited robust humoral and cellular immune responses in 
HIV+ adult subjects, whatever the cohort (ART High CD4 cohort, ART Low CD4 cohort, Non-ART High 
CD4 cohort). Strong responses were also observed after two doses. The third dose still induced an 
increase in anti-gE levels, but this increase was marginal for gE specific CD4[2+] T cells. Overall, 
responses were of the same magnitude as those found in immunocompetent individuals in other 
studies. 
In ZOSTER-001, the 3-dose and 2-dose gE/AS01B regimens and the 3-dose gE/AS01E regimen (half 
dose adjuvant) elicited robust humoral and cellular immune responses superior to placebo in adult 
subjects who had undergone autologous HCT within 50 to 70 days prior to the first dose of vaccine. 
HCT recipients responded well to HZ/su immunization in terms of CMI, which has been shown also for 
other vaccines, and the Applicant concluded that the most plausible rationale is that the AS01 adjuvant 
may support the expansion of gE-specific memory CD4+ T cells present in the transplant by providing 
them with a competitive advantage during T cell compartment reconstitution. The vaccine overall 
elicited a very robust immune response although lower than in immunocompetent subjects even after 
3 doses, with the 3-dose schedule superior to the 2-dose schedule. 
The immunogenicity results of ZOSTER-001 and ZOSTER-015 are reflected in the SmPC section 5.1 to 
inform prescribers. The timing between administration of chemotherapy and/or immunosuppressive 
drugs and/or immunomodulators and vaccination is likely to be important for the response to HZ/su, 
but this will be further discussed once the development is concluded and more data will be available. 
The need for specific follow-up measures in IC subjects 50 YOA and older, who are not excluded from 
the initial indication, was considered. Altogether, the potential use of HZ/su in ≥50 YOA IC adults does 
not raise concern based on the available data and therefore specific post-marketing follow-up 
measures in this population, beyond the planned routine pharmacovigilance for safety monitoring and 
the ongoing studies, are not deemed necessary.  
2.5.7.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The candidate HZ/su demonstrated very high efficacy against HZ and PHN in adults ≥ 50 YOA which 
was consistent across age strata, gender, regions as well as cohorts of analysis and statistical models. 
Following 2 intramuscular administrations separated by 2 months, the vaccine provided protective 
efficacy of 97.16% in subjects ≥50 YOA in ZOSTER-006. VE against zoster in the ≥70 YOA was 
confirmed in ZOSTER-022 and the pooled analysis (89.79% and 91.30%, respectively). High VE 
against HZ was maintained for at least 4 years (93.07% for subjects ≥50 YOA and 87.88% for the ≥70 
YOA at year 4). The duration of VE of HZ/su beyond 4 years will be further evaluated post-licensure.  
The ability of the vaccine to reduce PHN incidence as a consequence of HZ prevention, overall and by 
age strata, was evident, including in the older age groups. In powered analysis on pooled ZOSTER-006 
and ZOSTER-022, VE against PHN was estimated as 88.78% for the ≥70 YOA and 93.04% for the 70-
79 YOA stratum. A statistically significant PHN VE could not be demonstrated in the ≥80 YOA stratum 
(71.2%, 95% CI <0; 97.1), likely due to the lower number of subjects reporting PHN episodes. VE 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 135/170 
 
  
against PHN tended to decrease slightly with age and with time but was maintained at very high level 
over 4 years. No demonstrative VE was seen with respect to reducing PHN occurrence in breakthrough 
cases due to lack of study power. Therefore the benefit of the vaccine in the prevention of PHN can be 
attributed to its effect on the prevention of HZ. However the data related to pain and BOI obtained 
from secondary and exploratory endpoints suggest that HZ/su ameliorates the acute disease in 
breakthrough cases.  
Efficacy against HZ-related complications other than PHN is less clearly demonstrated due to lack of 
power. No cases of visceral disease or stroke associated with HZ were reported during the pivotal 
studies. Whether the vaccine can be effective in preventing these HZ complications remains open 
question. This information is reflected in the SmPC. 
An immunological correlate of protection has not been established; therefore the SmPC reflects that 
the level of immune response that provides protection against HZ is unknown. However post-dose 2 
anti-gE antibodies can be considered as immune marker for immunobridging on a case by case basis. 
The vaccine generated strong and persistent antigen-specific CD4 T-cell responses, which were 
consistently high across studies and investigated age strata. The results on humoral responses on anti-
gE ELISA in terms of anti-gE Ab VRRs, GMCs and fold increase over pre-vaccination anti-gE Ab 
concentrations elicited 1 month post Dose 2 are consistently high in all presented studies; they peak 1 
month after dose 2 and then decline but remain always higher than pre-vaccination titres (of at least 9 
fold) up until 3 years after vaccination in the pivotal studies. Persistence of humoral responses was 
further analysed in other studies; anti-gE antibody concentrations as well as frequencies of anti-gE 
specific CD4 T cells decline over the years but remain almost stable from year 4 to year 6 after 
vaccination.  
The need and timing of additional doses has not been established. However, the follow-up studies 
ZOSTER-049 and ZOSTER-060 will evaluate long-term vaccine efficacy and persistence of immune 
responses up to 10 yearsafter initial vaccination and further boostability of the immune response at 5 
and 10 years post-vaccination respectively. 
Clinical efficacy in subjects with previous history of HZ has not been evaluated. Subjects with previous 
history of HZ were excluded from the pivotal studies. The vaccine was shown to be immunogenic in 
one small study. This study had many limitations so more data from ongoing or planned studies (see 
below) are needed to clarify the uncertainty raised by the study (potential higher risk of HZ).   
Potential ‘inadvertent’ administration of the vaccine to VZV naïve individuals (hence use as a priming 
vaccine) in terms of safety, efficacy and immunogenicity will be followed up by routine 
pharmacovigilance. One study investigating HZ/su vaccination of subjects who have previously 
received Zostavax was only recently completed and data will be assessed post-authorisation (ZOSTER-
048).   
HZ/su can be given concomitantly with unadjuvanted inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine, and more 
co-administration data are currently being generated (see below). 
Although data are limited (a total of 135 individuals either HIV+ or HCT patients), the vaccine was 
shown to be immunogenic in an immunocompromised adult population. Given the consistently high HZ 
VE in older adults, including the oldest age group who generally have a weaker immune response, it is 
expected that HZ/su will also prevent HZ in adults with weakened immune responses due to disease or 
medication. No definite conclusion regarding HZ/su efficacy in IC adults can however be drawn before 
the results from the 4 ongoing studies are available. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address missing information related to 
efficacy/immunogenicity:

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Summary of the methodology used 
The “main” safety pooling analysis, which comprises the safety data from the 2 pivotal ZOSTER-006 
and ZOSTER-022 studies, was performed on all safety endpoints. These 2 studies have a similar study 
design and were performed simultaneously. This analysis includes a comparative analysis performed 
on safety data of the HZ/su group vs. the Placebo group (saline) in order to assess the relative risk 
(RR) of safety events. 
The broader safety pooling analysis comprises a descriptive analysis performed on all safety data 
(except reactogenicity endpoints) of the HZ/su group only (no Placebo group as comparison) of all 
studies included in this application with a safety follow-up period of at least one year post Dose 2 of 
HZ/su. This analysis was designed for the purpose of additional safety signal detection and evaluation.  
 The following safety endpoints were analysed in the pooled safety analyses: 
•  Solicited general/local symptoms during each 7-day post-vaccination period and overall, with 
further analysis of grade 3 solicited symptoms and solicited general symptoms with 
relationship to vaccination (in the 7-day diary card subset of ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 in 
the main safety pooling analysis only). 
Note: It was considered that the reactogenicity endpoints were sufficiently characterized in the 
main safety pooling analysis, since the majority of HZ/su recipients with reactogenicity 
assessment (85.4%) are included in this safety pooling. 
•  Unsolicited AEs during the 30-day post-vaccination period according to MedDRA4, with further 
analysis of grade 3 unsolicited AEs and unsolicited AEs with relationship to vaccination or with 
a medically attended visit.

•  SAEs during the 30-day post-vaccination period, with further analysis of fatal SAEs and SAEs 
with causal relationship to vaccination.  
•  SAEs during the one year post last vaccination period, with further analysis of fatal SAEs and 
SAEs with causal relationship to vaccination.

and SAEs with causal relationship to vaccination.

All solicited symptoms and unsolicited AEs were rated for intensity and the intensity was assigned to 
one of the following categories: grade 1 (mild, easily tolerated); grade 2 (moderate, interferes with 
normal everyday activities) and grade 3 (severe, prevents normal everyday activities).  
In addition, clinical laboratory evaluations were analysed in Phase I/II trials (EXPLOCRD- 004, 
ZOSTER-003 and ZOSTER-010 in older adults ≥50 YOA, and ZOSTER-001 and ZOSTER-015 in IC 
adults). 
‘Suspected cases of HZ’ (whether or not clinically diagnosed by the investigator) was a safety endpoint 
in trials in the early CDP of HZ/su; ‘confirmed cases of HZ’ (by PCR or by a GSK expert) was a safety 
endpoint in trials in IC adults (ZOSTER-001 and ZOSTER-015). In all other studies, suspected cases of 
HZ were collected as part of the endpoints for safety analyses and followed the standard AE or SAE 
reporting process as applicable and as described in each individual study protocol. 
In a subset of subjects (7-day diary card subset) in ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022, solicited local and 
general symptoms were recorded on a diary card for 7 days (Days 0-6) after each vaccination, while all 
other AEs occurring during the 30-day (Days 0-29) post-vaccination period were recorded as 
unsolicited AEs on the 30-day diary card. Subjects who did not belong to the 7-day diary card subset 
recorded all AEs occurring during the 30-day post-vaccination period as unsolicited AEs using the 30-
day diary card. This also pertained to AEs associated with PTs covering the local and general symptoms 
recorded as solicited by subjects who were part of the 7-day diary card subset. 
• 
• 
In ZOSTER-006, the 7-day diary card subset included 8,921 subjects, i.e., 2,667 subjects from 
the 50-59 YOA stratum, 2,666 subjects from the 60-69 YOA stratum and all 3,588 subjects 
from the ≥70 YOA stratum. Of note, 1 subject <50 YOA was allocated to the 50-59 YOA 
stratum (Placebo group). 
In ZOSTER-022, the 7-day diary card subset included 1,025 subjects, i.e., 574 subjects from 
the 70-79 YOA stratum and 451 subjects from the ≥80 YOA stratum.  
In addition, potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs) were collected during the 30-day post-
vaccination period and up to one year post-vaccination (all studies included in the safety pooling, 
except ZOSTER-003) and beyond one year post-vaccination in studies with longer follow-up time 
(ZOSTER-006, ZOSTER-022 and ZOSTER-024). pIMDs are a subset of AEs that include autoimmune 
diseases and other inflammatory and/or neurological disorders of interest, which may or may not have 
an autoimmune aetiology. The Applicant performed this assessment since there is a hypothetical 
concern regarding exacerbation or triggering of pIMDs linked to the immune-enhancing effects of the 
adjuvant (HZ/su contains the AS01B).

2.6.1.  Patient exposure 
In the 19 pivotal and supportive studies submitted for licensure, a total of 17,204 individuals received 
at least one IM dose of the final formulation of HZ/su. This includes 30 subjects younger than 50 years 
of age and 133 immunocompromised individuals. In the target population, i.e. adults 50 years of age 
and older, overall 17,041 individuals received at least one IM dose of the commercial formulation of 
HZ/su. 14,645 adults 50 years and older were included in the main safety pooling analysis, which 
comprises individuals who received HZ/su in the pivotal studies ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022. Of 
them, 5887 were 50 to 69 years of age, and 8758 ≥70 years of age. In studies included in the broader 
safety pooling analysis, a total of 15,493 older adults ≥50 YOA have been vaccinated with at least 1 
dose of HZ/su. 6,415 were 50-69 YOA and 9,078 were ≥70 YOA. A total of 30,234 doses were 
administered in all clinical studies included in the broader safety pooling analysis.  
The compliance with the 2-dose schedule was 95.1% for HZ/su recipients in all studies included in the 
broader safety pooling analysis. The 11 studies included in the safety pooling analyses are completed 
and have a safety follow up of at least 1 year post Dose 2. 
Although the procedure to request approval of HZ/su vaccination in immunocompromised adults will be 
part of a subsequent application, two completed studies (ZOSTER-001 and ZOSTER-015) conducted in 
IC adults were included in the submission. 74 HIV infected individual received 3 doses of HZ/su and 30 
and 31 autologous HCT recipients received 2 and 3 doses of HZ/su, respectively. 
The demographic profile of subjects included in the TVC of the main safety pooling analysis was 
comparable between the HZ/su and the placebo group in respect to age, sex, ethnicity, and geographic 
ancestry. Overall, the mean age at first vaccination in the main safety pooling analysis was 68.6 years, 
slightly more females than males were enrolled (58.2% versus 41.8%), and the majority of 
participants were White/Caucasians (73.7%). Demographic characteristics did not significantly change 
in the broader safety analysis and the subset with 7-day diary card. 
Table 41.  Clinical Studies with HZ/su Included in the 2 Pooled Analyses of Safety data 
In general, the demographic characteristics of the total exposed database were similar to the TVC. 
More female subjects than male subjects were included (58% vs 58.3% for vaccinated and control 
respectively). Median age was 68.6 for both groups. The proportion of White Caucasian was above 
73% in both groups. (73.7% and 73.6%, respectively), whereas 14.0% and 13.9% were from East

Asian heritage, 4.2% and 4.2% were Japanese, and 1.5% and 1.3% were African or African American, 
respectively. 
2.6.2.  Adverse events 
Solicited AEs - Reactogenicity  
Reactogenicity was analysed in the TVC with 7-day diary card from the main safety pooling analysis. In 
the HZ/su group, the most frequently reported solicited local symptom was pain at the injection site 
(68.1% overall/dose and 78.0% overall/subject) and the most frequent solicited general symptoms 
were myalgia, fatigue and headache (32.9%, 32.2% and 26.3% overall/dose and 44.7%, 44.5% and 
37.7% overall/subject, respectively). In the Placebo group the most frequently reported solicited local 
symptom was pain (6.9% overall/dose and 10.9% overall/subject) and the most frequently reported 
solicited general symptoms were fatigue, headache and myalgia (10.5%, 9.6% and 7.3% overall/dose 
and 16.5%, 15.5% and 11.7% overall/subject, respectively). The majority of solicited symptoms were 
mild to moderate in intensity. Most of the solicited general symptoms were considered related to 
vaccination by the investigator.  
In the HZ/su group, there was no difference between doses in incidence of solicited local symptoms, 
whereas there was a small increase in incidence of solicited general symptoms from Dose 1 to Dose 2, 
especially for grade 3 solicited general symptoms. The solicited symptoms typically lasted few days, 
i.e., median duration overall/dose in the HZ/su group was 3 days for solicited local symptoms, at most 
2 days for solicited general symptoms, and at most 2 days and 1 day for grade 3 solicited local and 
general symptoms, respectively. The incidence of solicited symptoms was lower in the ≥70 YOA group 
compared to the 50-69 YOA group, especially for solicited general symptoms (42.5% versus 59.3% of 
HZ/su doses, respectively). Meanwhile, in the HZ/su cohort, the incidence of overall grade 3 symptoms 
(solicited and unsolicited, general and local) was higher after Dose 2 (13.8%) compared to after Dose 
1 (11.7%) in the 50-69 YOA and (8.0%) compared to post-Dose 1 (6.4%) in the >70 YOA. Grade 3 
(severe) was defined as an Adverse Event which prevented normal, everyday activities.

When considering the TVC from the main safety pooling analysis, unsolicited AEs within the 30-day 
post-vaccination period were significantly more frequently reported in the HZ/su group compared to 
the Placebo group, i.e. after 10,624 of HZ/su doses (37.2%) by 7,393 subjects (50.5%), and after 
5,579 placebo doses (19.4%) by 4,689 subjects (32.0%; RR = 1.58 [95% CI: 1.52-1.64], unadjusted 
p < 0.00001). Note that this imbalance is mainly due to the fact that the subjects who were not 
included in the 7-day diary card subset have reported expected local and general symptoms as 
unsolicited AEs. Indeed, the majority of unsolicited AEs which were significantly more frequently 
reported in the HZ/su group compared to the Placebo group (unadjusted p-value <0.05) fell under the 
System Organ Class (SOC) of ‘General disorders and administration site conditions’, and were 
associated with PTs covering the local and general symptoms recorded as solicited on the 7-day diary 
card by subjects who were part of the TVC with 7-day diary card, i.e. local injection site symptoms 
(including pain, redness and swelling) and general symptoms (including fever, headache, fatigue, chills 
[PT covering the solicited general symptom of shivering], myalgia and nausea). Among the other 
significantly more frequently reported unsolicited AEs by subject in the HZ/su group compared to 
Placebo group, 4 additional unsolicited AEs were reported with an incidence ≥1.0% in HZ/su recipients, 
and at least twice as often in the HZ/su group compared to the Placebo group. These are: 
• 
Injection site pruritus (2.2% in the HZ/su group vs. 0.2% in the Placebo group; RR = 9.07 
[95% CI: 6.38-13.25]) 
•  Malaise (1.7.% vs. 0.3% of subjects, respectively; RR = 5.91 [95% CI: 4.27-8.37]) 
• 
• 
Pain (1.4% vs. 0.2% of subjects, respectively; RR = 6.01 [95% CI: 4.16-8.91]), 
Injection site warmth (1.0% vs. <0.1% of subjects, respectively; RR = 29.83 [95% CI: 12.50-
93.22]). 
In the TVC of the broader safety pooling analysis, unsolicited AEs within the 30-day post-vaccination 
period were reported following 10,915 HZ/su doses (36.1%) by 7,642 subjects (49.3%).

When considering the TVC with 7-day diary card from the main safety pooling analysis, no imbalances 
have been observed between HZ/su and Placebo groups, i.e. unsolicited AEs within the 30-day post-
vaccination period were reported following 1,720 HZ/su doses (17.7%) and following 1,570 placebo 
doses (16.1%). Overall per subject, unsolicited AEs were reported by 1,451 subjects (29.2%) in the 
HZ/su group and 1,371 subjects (27.5%) in the Placebo group. The most frequently reported 
unsolicited AEs following at least 1.0% of HZ/su doses were nasopharyngitis (1.6% of HZ/su and 
placebo doses by 2.9% and 3.0% of subjects in the HZ/su and Placebo groups, respectively) and upper 
respiratory tract infection (1.0% and 0.6% of doses by 1.9% and 1.1% of subjects, respectively). 
However, none of these AEs had a frequency of more than 2-fold higher in the HZ/su group than in the 
Placebo group, and are therefore not included in the section 4.8 of the SmPC. By age stratum, the 
incidence of unsolicited AEs was similar in subjects 50-69 YOA and subjects ≥70 YOA. 
In the TVC from the main safety pooling, unsolicited AEs considered related as per investigator 
assessment and within the 30-day post-vaccination period were reported after 7,489 HZ/su doses 
(26.2%) by 5,052 subjects (34.5%), and after 1,085 placebo doses (3.8%) by 968 subjects (6.6%). 
By PT, apart from the related unsolicited AEs also reported as local and general symptoms in the TVC 
with 7-day diary card, the most frequently reported related unsolicited AEs in the HZ/su group (≥1.0% 
of subjects) were injection site pruritus, following 1.3% of doses by 2.1% of subjects, malaise, 
following 0.9% of doses by 1.6% of subjects, pain, following 0.7% of doses by 1.2% of subjects, and 
injection site warmth, following 0.6% of doses by 1.0% of subjects. 
All adverse reactions proposed for inclusion in the section 4.8 ‘Undesirable effects’ of the SmPC are 
presented in table 47.

Overall, the majority of the imbalances between HZ/su and placebo recipients that were observed in 
terms of unsolicited AEs were related to PTs referring to solicited symptoms, with a few additional 
unsolicited AEs (chills, injection site pruritus and malaise) identified in the HZ/su group.

In the broader safety pooling analysis, 9 additional subjects in the HZ/su group died during the whole 
post-vaccination follow-up period (643 subjects [4.2%]). The majority of fatal SAEs had a time to 
onset of longer than 1 year post last vaccination. In the main pooling, 17 subjects (0.1%) in the HZ/su 
group and 21 subjects (0.1%) in the Placebo group died from the first administered dose up to 30 days 
post last vaccination, while 153 subjects (1.0%) in the HZ/su group and 168 subjects (1.1%) in the 
Placebo group reported fatal SAEs up to 1 year post last vaccination. Based on the main safety pooling 
analysis, the most common fatal SAEs in the HZ/su group by PT ( ≥0.2% of HZ/su recipients) and 
placebo group (≥0.1% of placebo recipients) were cardiac failure (0.3% in the HZ/su group and 0.4% 
in the Placebo group), pneumonia and myocardial infection (0.3% and 0.3%, respectively), cardiac 
arrest (0.2% and 0.2%, respectively), death (not otherwise specified; 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively) 
and lung neoplasm malignant (0.2% and 0.1%, respectively). When considering these specific PTs in 
the broader safety pooling analysis, 1 additional PT of myocardial infarction and 3 additional PTs of 
‘death’ (not otherwise specified) were reported as fatal SAE. 
The majority of fatal SAEs during the entire study period occurred in subjects ≥70 YOA (6.2% and 
6.6% of subjects in the HZ/su and Placebo groups, respectively, in the main safety pooling, and 6.0% 
in the HZ/su group in the broader safety pooling), while the incidence in subjects 50-69 YOA was 1.6% 
and 1.7% in the HZ/su and Placebo groups, respectively, in the main safety pooling, and 1.5% in the 
HZ/su group in the broader safety pooling. By age range in the 50-59 YOA, 60-69 YOA, 70 79 YOA and 
≥80 YOA strata, the percentage of subjects reporting fatal SAEs during the whole post-vaccination 
follow-up period increased with age in both groups, as expected. 
One fatal SAE was considered by the investigator to be vaccine related: a subject with a history of 
stable immune thrombocytopenic purpura developed AML 75 days following the first dose of HZ/su in 
study ZOSTER-022. The subject was being treated with azacitidine. 97 days following dose 1 of HZ/su 
the subject was hospitalised with febrile neutropenia; their condition deteriorated under therapy with 
filgrastim and Piperacillin/Tazobactam and the subject died the day after hospital admission. The 
investigator considered that it cannot be ruled out that HZ/su might have been the cause of AML and 
the associated neutropenic sepsis. The CHMP considers a relationship between vaccination and AML 
highly unlikely as the neutropenic sepsis and subsequent events are considered most likely side effects 
of the ongoing acazitidine therapy. 
Serious adverse events 
Overall, no imbalances between the HZ/su and Placebo groups have been observed in terms of SAEs 
reported over the entire study period, i.e. 12.8% (95% CI: 12.3-13.4) of HZ/su recipients and 13.3% 
(95% CI: 12.7-13.8) of subjects in the Placebo group (RR = 0.97 [95% CI: 0.91-1.03], unadjusted p-
value = 0.31578).

Table 48.  Main safety pooling analysis: Percentage of subjects reporting the occurrence of serious 
adverse events classified by MedDRA Primary System Organ Class during the whole post-
vaccination follow-up period (sorted by incidence in the HZ/su group) (Total Vaccinated Cohort) 
No medically relevant clusters of events (in terms of incidence and nature of SAEs) were observed in 
the HZ/su group compared to the Placebo group. In the main safety pooling analysis, SAEs were 
reported by 1,880 subjects (12.8%) in the HZ/su group and by 1,945 subjects (13.3%) in the Placebo 
group during the entire study period. From the first administered dose up to 30 days post last 
vaccination, SAEs were reported by 342 subjects (2.3%) receiving HZ/su and 327 subjects (2.2%) 
receiving placebo. In the broader safety pooling analysis (HZ/su group only), 100 additional HZ/su 
recipients reported SAEs during the entire study period. From the first administered dose up to 30 days 
post last vaccination, SAEs were reported by 366 subjects (2.4%) in the broader safety pooling 
analysis. 
SAEs reported in the HZ/su group by PT (≥0.3% of HZ/su recipients) during the entire study period 
were pneumonia (0.8% in the HZ/su group and 0.7% in the Placebo group), cardiac failure (0.5% and 
0.6%, respectively), myocardial infarction (0.5% each), atrial fibrillation (0.4% each), cerebrovascular 
accident (0.4% and 0.3%, respectively), coronary artery disease and cardiac failure congestive (0.3% 
each in both groups), and urinary tract infection (0.3% and 0.2%, respectively). The most frequently 
reported SAEs were similar in the broader safety pooling analysis. 
In the main safety pooling analysis, SAEs considered related to vaccination by the investigator were 
reported by 15 subjects (0.1%) in the HZ/su group and by 13 subjects (0.1%) in the Placebo group 
Assessment report

during the entire study period. In the HZ/su group, all related SAEs were reported by at most 1 
subject. From the first administered dose up to 30 days post last vaccination, related SAEs were 
reported by 8 subjects (0.1%) in both the HZ/su and Placebo group. In the broader safety pooling 
analysis, no additional related SAE was reported in the HZ/su group.  
During the entire study period, SAEs were reported with a higher incidence in subjects ≥70 YOA 
(16.5% and 17.3% in the HZ/su and Placebo groups, respectively, in the main safety pooling, and 
16.6% in the HZ/su group in the broader safety pooling) compared to subjects 50-69 YOA (7.4% and 
7.2% in the HZ/su and Placebo groups, respectively, in the main safety pooling, and 7.3% in the 
HZ/su group in the broader safety pooling). Considering the related SAEs in the HZ/su group, 12 of 
them were reported in ≥70 YOA, and 3 of them in 50-69 YOA. In the Placebo group, the incidence of 
related SAEs was similar between the ≥70 YOA (8 subjects) and 50-69 YOA (7 subjects) strata. By age 
range in the 50-59 YOA, 60-69 YOA, 70 79 YOA and ≥80 YOA strata, the percentage of subjects 
reporting SAEs during the whole post-vaccination follow-up period increased with age in both groups. 
SAEs of special interest   
Potential Immune-Mediated Disease (pIMDs) 
Potential immune mediated diseases (pIMDs) are a subset of AEs that include autoimmune diseases 
and other inflammatory and/or neurological disorders of interest, which may or may not have an 
autoimmune aetiology. For all vaccines containing adjuvant systems, including AS01B, pIMDs are 
considered events of interest based on their possible effects on the regulation of the immune system 
and the potential (yet theoretical) risk that they may induce unwanted immune processes in 
susceptible individuals. 
No medically relevant differences have been observed between the HZ/su and Placebo groups in terms 
of incidence and nature of pIMDs reported over the entire study period. In the main safety pooling 
analysis during the whole post-vaccination follow-up period, pIMDs were reported by 179 subjects 
(1.2%) in the HZ/su group and by 202 subjects (1.4%) in the Placebo group. By PT, the most 
frequently reported pIMDs (≥10 subjects) in both groups were polymyalgia rheumatica (32 subjects in 
the HZ/su group and 29 subjects in the Placebo group), rheumatoid arthritis (20 and 26 subjects, 
respectively), psoriasis (15 and 18 subjects, respectively) and autoimmune thyroiditis (13 and 10 
subjects, respectively). In the broader safety pooling analysis, 5 additional subjects in the HZ/su group 
reported pIMDs during the entire study period (i.e. a total of 184 subjects [1.2%]). 
In the main safety pooling analysis, pIMDs considered to be vaccine related by the investigator were 
reported in 16 subjects (0.1%) in the HZ/su group and 18 subjects (0.1%) in the Placebo group during 
the entire study period. By PT, most of the related pIMDs were reported by at most 1 subject in the 
HZ/su group, except for rheumatoid arthritis (2 subjects) and psoriasis (2 subjects). In the broader 
safety pooling analysis, no additional related pIMD was reported in the HZ/su group. The following 
pIMDs were additionally recorded in the broader safety analysis: 1 additional polymyalgia rheumatic, 1 
additional psoriasis, 2 additional cases of trigeminal nerve paresis, one additional Crohn`s disease, 2 
additional colitis ulcerative, and 8 additional IVth nerve paralysis. 
The percentage of subjects reporting pIMDs by age stratum was comparable in the 50-69 YOA and 
≥70 YOA strata (0.2% in each vaccine group).  
Hypersensitivity (including anaphylaxis) 
As for other vaccines, hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis to one or several components 
of the vaccine are considered AEs of special interest. Anaphylaxis following immunization is a serious 
but rare occurrence, i.e. estimates are in the range of 1-10 per 1 million doses distributed depending 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 147/170 
 
  
on the vaccine studied. During the clinical development of HZ/su, subjects with known hypersensitivity 
to one or several components of the vaccine were excluded from enrolment.  
Overall, no case of HZ/su-related anaphylaxis was identified in the main or broader safety pooling 
analysis. Several unsolicited AEs (by PT) indicative of hypersensitivity reaction and considered to be 
vaccine related by the investigator were recorded in the HZ/su vaccine group in the main safety 
pooling analysis. This includes, anaphylactic reaction (1 subject), hypersensitivity (3 subjects), rash 
generalized (4 subjects), rash macular (2 subjects), rash pruritic (3 subjects), urticarial (4 subjects), 
flushing (8 subjects in the vaccine and no subjects in the placebo group), and hot flush (6 subjects). 
A statement on hypersensitivity is included in the “4.3 Contraindications” section of the SmPC. 
2.6.4.  Laboratory findings 
Biochemical and hematological evaluations were conducted at baseline and at pre-defined time points 
in older adults in studies EXPLO-CRD-004, ZOSTER-003, ZOSTER-010 and ZOSTER-023, as well in 
immunocompromised adults in the phase I/IIa studies ZOSTER-001 and ZOSTER-015. The 
hematological laboratory parameters evaluated were hemoglobin concentration, white blood cell 
counts, differential white blood cells (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils) 
and platelets in all studies; red blood cell counts and hematocrit in all studies except for ZOSTER-015; 
and mean corpuscular volume in ZOSTER-010. Biochemical laboratory parameters tested included 
serum creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase in all studies; lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH), calcium, fibrinogen, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and 
total protein levels in ZOSTER-001 and ZOSTER-015; and sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, glucose, 
alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin (direct and total) and albumin in ZOSTER-015. The great majority of 
subjects in all studies had laboratory values within normal ranges for all evaluated parameters at all 
time points. No clinical relevant changes pre- and post-vaccination were observed. The proportion of 
subjects with variations in laboratory values before and after vaccination was balanced between the 
vaccine groups in the different studies that evaluated laboratory parameters. Based on these data, no 
clinically significant alteration of hematologic or biochemical laboratory parameters has been observed 
following vaccination with HZ/su.  
2.6.5.  Safety in special populations 
Pregnancy 
There  are  no  data  on  the  use  of  HZ/su  in  pregnant  women.  Animal  studies  performed  with  HZ/su 
administered to female rats do not indicate any harmful effects with respect to pregnancy. The effect 
on  breast-fed  infants  of  administration  of  HZ/su  to  their  mothers  has  not  been  studied.  Only  one 
pregnancy was recorded in all submitted studies. This subject was enroled in ZOSTER-023, a Phase I, 
open  label,  single-group  study  to  evaluate  the  safety,  reactogenicity  and  immunogenicity  of  HZ/su  in 
20 healthy adults of Japanese ethnic origin, stratified by age in a 1:1 ratio: 18-30 YOA and 50-69 YOA. 
Ten  subjects  were  of  child-bearing  age.  The  pregnancy  occurred  in  a  29-year  old  female,  about  4 
months after she received the second dose of HZ/su. About 12 months after the last vaccination, the 
woman gave birth to a healthy live female infant after 39 weeks of gestation.   
Subjects with previous history of HZ (ZOSTER-033) 
In ZOSTER-033, the evaluation of the safety and reactogenicity following administration of HZ/su from 
the first vaccination up to 30 days post last vaccination in all study subjects ≥50 YOA with a previous 
episode of HZ (by descriptive statistics) was a co-primary objective. 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 148/170 
 
  
In all 96 subjects ≥50 YOA with a physician-documented history of HZ who were vaccinated in this 
study, the HZ/su vaccine was well tolerated and no safety concerns were identified. No vaccine-related 
SAEs, fatal SAEs or pIMDs were reported up to study end (12 months post vaccination). The safety and 
reactogenicity of the vaccine is not influenced by previous HZ episode, and although no control group 
was included in this study the safety profile was generally similar to that seen in other clinical studies 
in a population with no history of HZ. There were 9 episodes of suspected HZ reported in 6 (6.3%) 
subjects during this study, which was higher than the recurrence rate reported in the literature (up to 
6.2% over a 7.3 year follow-up period). Considering laboratory confirmation of cases was not required 
per protocol, combined with the fact that some suspected cases were based on self-reporting by the 
subjects (some of them without medical diagnosis), an over-reporting of HZ is suspected, especially in 
the context of the high HZ VE shown in adults ≥50 YOA. Indeed, study participants were trained to 
recognize and report symptoms of HZ during the initial visit, which may have contributed to an 
increased awareness of HZ signs. Note that none of these suspected HZ cases were considered related 
to vaccination by the investigator. Furthermore, in Phase III clinical trials, between 24.8% and 40.2% 
of self-reported cases were confirmed as false positives after more rigorous testing. In addition, when 
epidemiological data suggest that the incidence does not differ between regions, the reported cases all 
occurred in the same country (Canada). As the study was not designed to formally evaluate HZ 
recurrence (uncontrolled study with a limited sample size and no HZ confirmatory testing), conclusions 
regarding this specific aspect of the study have to be considered with caution. See section 2.6.9 for 
more details. See also sections 2.5.5.4 and 2.5.6 for study details and discussion around efficacy 
aspects. 
Safety of HZ/su when administered subcutaneously 
ZOSTER-032 was a Phase III, open-label, uncontrolled study to evaluate the safety and 
immunogenicity of HZ/su when administered SC as compared to IM according to a 0, 2-month 
schedule. A total of 60 Japanese adults 50 years and older were vaccinated, 30 subjects each in the IM 
and SC vaccine group. The immune response after SC and IM injection of HZ/su in that very limited 
number of subjects appeared to be comparable. Efficacy was not evaluated following SC vaccination. 
The safety profile was comparable for the two routes of administration. Reactogenicity including severe 
reactions following SC was higher than following IM administration of HZ/su. This observation is known 
from other vaccines.  
The incidence of solicited symptoms (local and general) overall per subject was only slightly higher in 
the SC compared with the IM vaccine group (100% of subjects versus 93.3%, respectively). Local 
reactogenicity was higher in the SC vaccine group compared with the IM vaccine group. Apart from 
injection site pain that was reported in a comparable proportion of subjects in the SC and the IM 
vaccine group (93.3% versus 90.0%) all other solicited local reactions were far more frequently 
reported in the SC compared with the IM vaccine group. Injection site redness and swelling were 
overall reported by 86.7% versus 31.3%, and 80.0% versus 22.7% of subjects, respectively. Injection 
site pruritus was reported by 70% of subjects in the SC and 33.3% in the IM vaccine group, 
respectively. Severe redness was reported by 56.7% in the SC vaccine group versus 0.8% in the IM 
group, severe injection site swelling by 33.3% versus 0.8% of subjects, and severe injection site pain 
by 6.7% versus 0.0%. Systemic reactogenicity was also higher in the SC vaccine group, but less than 
local reactogenicity. The most frequent symptom in both groups was fatigue reported by 70% versus 
53.3% of subjects, followed by headache (56.7% versus 43.3%). The fever incidence was comparable 
in both groups (20.0% versus 23.3%, respectively). Severe solicited systemic symptoms were low in 
both groups and occurred not in a higher incidence in the SC vaccine compared with the IM vaccine 
group (overall per subject 3.3% versus 10.0%, respectively).  
The incidence of unsolicited AEs was comparable in both groups (30.0% in the SC and 20.0% in the IM 
vaccine group). Unsolicited AEs considered to be vaccine related were reported by 3.3%, each. 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 149/170 
 
  
No subjects died during the study. Three subjects, 2 in the SC HZ/su group and 1 in the IM HZ/su 
group, experienced non-fatal SAEs during the study. None of these SAEs were considered related to 
vaccination by the investigator. 
Immunocompromised subjects (ZOSTER-001, ZOSTER-015) 
In both ZOSTER-001 and ZOSTER-015, the evaluation of the safety and reactogenicity of the 
investigational HZ vaccine formulations used in these studies in subjects ≥18 YOA with a selected IC 
condition (autologous HCT and HIV infection, respectively) was a co-primary objective. 
More than half of the subjects participating in ZOSTER-001 and ZOSTER-015 (N=73; 54%) were ≥50 
YOA. 
Safety in adult autologous hematopoietic stem cell recipients≥ 18 years of age 
ZOSTER-001 was a  Phase I/IIa, randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the 
safety and immunogenicity of 3 and 2 IM injections of the final formulation of HZ/su (50 μg gE/AS01B) 
in  comparison  to  3  IM  injections  of  gE  combined  with  1/2  dose  (i.e.  25µg)  AS01B  adjuvant  (50  μg 
gE/AS01E) and to 3 doses of Placebo administered to autologous HCT recipients ≥18 years of age. The 
TVC  included  120  subjects  equally  randomised  into  the  4  parallel  groups  in  a  1:1:1:1  ratio.  The 
incidence  of  symptoms  was  comparable  in  the  three  vaccine  groups  and  lower  in  the  3-dose  placebo 
group.  During  the  7-day  post-vaccination  period  overall,  93.1%  to  96.7%  of  gE/AS01  vaccine 
recipients experienced at least one solicited or unsolicited symptom compared to 66.7% in the 3-dose 
placebo  control  group.  The  incidence  of  local  symptoms  was  82.8%  to  90%  in  gE/AS01  vaccine 
recipients  versus  23.3%  in  the  3-dose  placebo  group,  and  was  86.2%  to  93.1%  versus  63.3%  for 
general  symptoms,  respectively.  The  reactogenicity  and  safety  profile  of  HZ/su  administered  to  a 
limited  number  of  HCT  recipients  according  to  a  3  and  2  dose  schedule  did  not  reveal  any  safety 
concern.  
Safety in adult HIV subjects 
ZOSTER-015 was an observer-blind, placebo-controlled study with 2 treatment groups randomized to 
receive 3 doses of HZ/su or placebo at 0, 2, 6 months. A total of 123 subjects were vaccinated (74 in 
the gE/AS01B group and 49 in the placebo group). Local reactogenicity overall per subject was notably 
higher in the vaccine compared with the placebo group. 97.3% versus 12.2% of subjects reported 
unsolicited and solicited local symptoms. The majority of local solicited symptoms were mild or 
moderate. Grade 3 injection site symptoms occurred in 16.4% (injection site pain) to 1.4% (injection 
site swelling) of subjects. General solicited symptoms occurred in overall 75.3% (fatigue) to 50.7% of 
subjects (shivering) in the vaccine cohort. Fever was reported by 30.1% of gE/AS01B recipients, 
respectively. The majority of solicited general symptoms were mild or moderate. Severe solicited 
general symptoms were reported by 12.3% (shivering) to 1.4% (gastrointestinal symptoms). No grade 
3 fever was reported. In summary, the safety and reactogenicity profile of HZ/su administered to the 
74 HIV infected subjects did not raise any safety concern. 
Conclusion  
Several Phase III studies in IC adults are ongoing, and so far, the IDMCs overseeing 3 (ZOSTER-002, 
ZOSTER-039 and ZOSTER-041) of these 4 ongoing studies have not raised any safety concern. 
Therefore, it can be concluded that HZ/su was well tolerated when administered to IC adults ≥50 YOA 
with autologous HCT or HIV infection, although based on a very limited number of adults ≥18 YOA with 
a selection of IC conditions. The procedure to request approval of HZ/su vaccination in 
immunocompromised adults 18 years and older will be the subject of a subsequent application.

2.6.6.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
In study ZOSTER-004 the safety and reactogenicity of HZ/su administered concomitantly or 
sequentially with the Applicant’s D-QIV influenza vaccine was evaluated in subjects≥50 years of age. A 
total of 828 subjects were vaccinated either concomitantly with D-QIV or sequentially. Of note, 
solicited local and general symptoms occurred within the same range in the co-ad and the control 
group and the incidence was comparable overall per subject. Unsolicited AEs, pIMDs, SAEs and deaths 
occurred in a comparable proportion of subjects in both groups. None of the pIMDs, the SAEs and the 
deaths was considered being vaccine related. In summary the co-administration of HZ/su with D-QIV 
did not impact the reactogenicity or safety profile of HZ/su or D-QIV. The study did not reveal any 
safety concern.  
There is no data on co-administration with Prevenar 13, Hepatitis B adjuvanted vaccine or other 
Influenza adjuvanted vaccine. Two additional co-administration studies are currently ongoing with 
Pneumovax and Boostrix.  
2.6.7.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Of the 15,405 and 13,900 subjects included in the TVC at ZOSTER-006 End Of Study and in ZOSTER-
022, 1,824 and 2,369 subjects were withdrawn, respectively. The most common reason for 
discontinuation was consent withdrawal in ZOSTER-006 (N=722), and withdrawal due to an SAE in 
ZOSTER-022 (N=943). A total of 462 subjects of ZOSTER-006 were withdrawn due to an SAE.  
No apparent imbalance was observed between HZ/su and Placebo groups in either study regarding 
subjects withdrawn due to any reason. 
Of the 15,411 subjects included in the TVC at ZOSTER-006 final analysis, 1,431 subjects were 
withdrawn. The most common reason for discontinuation was consent withdrawal (N = 607). A total of 
370 subjects were withdrawn due to an SAE. No apparent imbalance was observed between HZ/su and 
Placebo groups in either study regarding subjects withdrawn due to any reason.  
During the whole post-vaccination follow-up period, 77 subjects receiving HZ/su (0.5%) and 33 
subjects receiving placebo (0.2%) were withdrawn from the study due to a non-serious AE, while 683 
subjects receiving HZ/su (4.7%) and 722 subjects receiving placebo (4.9%) were withdrawn due to an 
SAE. In the broader safety pooling analysis, 3 additional subjects receiving HZ/su were withdrawn due 
to a non-serious AE and 1 additional subject due to an SAE. 
In the main safety pooling analysis up to 1 month post Dose 2 (Month 3), 62 subjects receiving HZ/su 
(0.4%) and 17 subjects receiving placebo (0.1%) were withdrawn from the study due to a non-serious 
AE. In addition, 54 subjects receiving HZ/su (0.4%) and 48 subjects receiving placebo (0.3%) were 
withdrawn due to an SAE. 
2.6.8.  Post marketing experience 
Not applicable. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The general safety profile of HZ/su is considered acceptable.  
The safety data base is large and adequately represents the target population. A total of 17,041 
individuals≥ 50 years of age received at least one IM dose of the commercial formulation of HZ/su. 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 151/170 
 
  
14,645 adults 50 years and older were included in the main safety pooling analysis, that comprises 
individuals who received at least one dose of HZ/su in the pivotal studies ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-
022. Of them, 5887 were 50 to 69 years of age, and 8758 ≥70 years of age. A total of 15,493 older 
adults≥ 50 YOA have been included into the broader safety pooling analysis, comprising additional 
studies conducted with different designs. Of them 6,415 were 50-69 years of age and 9,078 were ≥70 
years of age. Solicited local and general AEs were collected in a subset of 4969 subjects. The incidence 
of solicited (local and general) symptoms is based on the TVC with 7-day diary card, and the incidence 
of unsolicited AEs is based on the TVC. The frequencies of the adverse reactions reported in the SmPC 
are based on the main safety pooling analysis. 
Solicited AEs were more frequently reported by subjects in the vaccine group compared with the 
placebo group. Relative risks are statistically significant and above 1 for overall solicited AEs. Among 
HZ/su recipients, 80.8% (71.5% overall/dose) had at least one local symptom, and 64.8% (51.6% 
overall/dose) had at least one general symptom within the 7-day post-vaccination period vs. 11.7% 
(7.4% overall/dose) and 29.1% (19.4% overall/dose) of subjects in the Placebo group, respectively. 
The most frequently reported solicited local AE in the HZ/su and the placebo group was injection site 
pain, reported respectively by 70.3% overall/subject (68.1% overall/dose) and by 10.9% 
overall/subject (6.9% overall/dose). More than 40% of subjects in the HZ/su group reported solicited 
systemic AEs. The most frequently reported overall per subject in the 2 groups were myalgia (44.7% 
versus 11.7% overall/subject), fatigue (44.5% versus 16.5% overall/subject) and headache (37.7% 
versus 15.5% overall/subject). Fever was reported by 20.5% of subjects in the HZ/su group, but grade 
3 fever (i.e. temperature > 39°C) occurred in only 0.3% of HZ/su recipients in that group. Grade 3 
(severe) was defined as an Adverse Event which prevented normal, everyday activities. The great 
majority (>90%) of solicited AEs was graded as mild or moderate and resolved usually within the first 
3 days. Severe solicited local AEs occurred overall per subject in not more than 6.4% (injection site 
pain) and severe systemic AEs in not more than 5.1% (myalgia). Severe AEs lasted at most 2 days 
(solicited local AEs) and 1 day (solicited general AEs).  
Reactogenicity was higher in the younger age stratum (50-69 years of age) compared with the older 
one (≥70 years of age), especially for solicited general adverse reactions. The lower reactogenicity in 
older subjects is known from other vaccines. Incidence and severity of solicited local symptoms did not 
tend to increase by dose in the pivotal studies. Solicited general AEs were reported in a slightly higher 
proportion of subjects following dose 2, especially grade 3 solicited general symptoms. The observed 
reactogenicity is not unexpected for an adjuvanted vaccine and the results do not reveal any concern. 
The safety profile of HZ/su was acceptable within the follow-up period in all studies and all populations 
included into the studies. The drop-out rate due to (S)AEs was low and balanced between the HZ/su 
and Placebo groups. 
Apart from expected local and general reactions that were recorded as unsolicited AEs in the SOC of 
general disorders and administration site conditions (e.g. injection site reactions, malaise, fatigue, 
chills), nervous system disorders (headache and dizziness), and musculoskeletal tissue disorders 
(myalgia, arthralgia), unsolicited AEs recorded in the HZ/su group did not show any specific pattern or 
cluster. Arthralgia is considered a common expected adverse reaction following vaccination. There is a 
biological plausibility for the occurrence of lymph node pain, lymphadenitis, and lymphadenopathy; 
hence it was included in the SmPC as uncommon ADR. 
An imbalance was observed in the occurrence of Gout and Gouty arthritis between the vaccinated and 
the placebo groups with a relative risk above 3. This statistical association was discussed by the 
Applicant and no cause-effect relationship could be demonstrated. However as a biological plausibility 
cannot be ruled out, the Applicant will follow up on this specific unsolicited event (gout) by active and 
enhanced surveillance.

There are no specific concerns with regards to hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis. 
Incidence and nature of serious adverse events (SAEs, related and unrelated) was balanced between 
the HZ/su and the placebo group with no medically relevant clusters of SAEs reported in the HZ/su 
group compared to the Placebo group. SAEs considered to be HZ/su related by the investigator did not 
occur in more than one subject. The most frequently reported SAEs when classified by SOC were 
cardiac disorders, followed by infections and infestations (mainly of the respiratory tract) and 
neoplasms (benign, malignant and unspecified). The majority of SAEs HZ/su vaccine appeared to be 
associated with the target/studied population’s risk factors (e.g. advanced age). The Incidence Rate is 
in line with epidemiological studies in a similar population. Same is true for fatal cases. One fatal SAE 
was considered being vaccine related by the investigator, but it is the view of the CHMP/PRAC that a 
relationship between vaccination and AML is highly unlikely based on the nature of the event (no 
biological plausibility). The neutropenic sepsis is considered most likely a side effect of the concomitant 
acazitidine therapy. 
The distribution of SAEs at day 30, 1y and 4y post 1st dose for some PTs were not well-balanced. In 
the vaccinated cohort (especially after 1 year of 1st dose), some individual Medra-PTs showed an 
increased RR for SAEs and were attributed to Basal cell carcinoma, Pneumoniae and Lung Neoplasm. 
Also, the distribution of fatal outcomes at day 30, 1y and 4y post-vaccination for same specific PTs 
(except basal carcinoma) were not balanced between the 2 cohorts. The potential implications of this 
imbalance in terms of safety of the vaccine were further discussed during evaluation. The clinical and 
non-clinical data available for AS01- and other adjuvanted vaccines collectively indicate that the 
occurrence of a sustained dysregulation of the innate immune response that could accelerate/facilitate 
the development of infections or cancer induced by AS01 in combination with gE is unlikely. The fact 
that the innate immune responses triggered by AS01 to enhance gE specific response are transient and 
return to baseline by day 7 is additionally reassuring. It was concluded that from a scientific/medical 
point of view biological plausibility of the events discussed above and a potential correlation with 
vaccination appears unlikely, and other factors may directly intervene in the cause-effect relationship.  
The Applicant discussed the concomitant prophylactic use of paracetamol around the time of 
vaccination to relieve vaccine solicited events (reactogenicity) such as pain. In the absence of robust 
data on the potential impact of antipyretics/analgesics on HZ/su immunogenicity and reactogenicity 
and based on the inconclusive literature data available from other vaccines in adult populations, a 
definitive recommendation cannot be given.  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria of clinical studies with HZ/su allowed recruitment of an overall 
older adult population, including subjects with co-morbidities. However no formal assessment of frailty 
status was foreseen or performed at enrolment in any of the studies that have been completed to date. 
The clinical impact of the very common AEs (especially of grade 3) on the frail population is currently 
unknown and needs to be assessed. Therefore ‘Use of HZ/su in frail adults 50 years of age or older’ is 
included as missing information in the RMP. The post-marketing commitments to address safety of 
HZ/su in the frail population are reflected in the next section.   
Adjuvanted vaccines are considered as a potential trigger for onset of autoimmune disease. The 
theoretical risk of acquiring an autoimmune disease derives from the immunological mechanism of 
action, i.e. in particular the immune enhancing effect of the adjuvants. In the trials conducted during 
the clinical development of HZ/su subjects were followed up at least for 6 months and up to 1 year 
after the last vaccine dose in order to detect autoimmune disease onset related to vaccination. The 
incidence and nature of pIMDs was balanced in the two vaccine groups. In the pooled analysis of safety 
there were 179 pIMDs reported after HZ/su administration (1.2%) compared to 202 cases (1.4%) 
reported in control group. 16 out of the 179 pIMDs in the vaccine group versus 18 in the placebo group 
were considered as related to the vaccine. Most frequently reported PTs in both groups are polymyalgia

rheumatica, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and autoimmune thyroiditis. The reviewed safety data do 
not reveal a safety signal with respect to the potential risk of developing autoimmune disease following 
HZ/su vaccination, including the oldest age categories (>70 YOA) and populations undergoing 
immunosuppressive treatment (ZOSTER-001) or immunocompromised (ZOSTER-015). However the 
power of pre-licensure clinical trials to detect very rare events such as new onset of autoimmune 
disease is limited due to the sample size, since incidence rates of different AD vary roughly from 1 to 
20/100,000 per year. AS01 is a new generation of adjuvant inducing a strong innate immune 
response. The experience with this novel adjuvant is still limited and the working mechanisms are not 
fully understood. Although the issues of occurrence of pIMDs as a result of vaccination and potential 
exacerbation of existing/underlying pIMDs (see below) are shared with other adjuvanted vaccines, an 
elderly population might have in principle a higher risk linked to general systemic inflammation or 
immune-dysregulation that they may experience as a results of ageing. For those reasons, the 
theoretical risk of developing a pIMD after HZ/su vaccination is considered as a potential safety 
concern in the RMP for post-authorisation follow-up via surveillance and safety study.  
 In subjects with pre-existing IMDs, clinical exacerbation triggered by AS01B-adjuvanted vaccine was 
not identified but cannot be ruled out either, since a significant proportion of patients with pre-existing 
pIMDs and/or treated with steroids or immune-modulators would have been excluded from the pivotal 
studies based on the exclusion criteria as the studies were not designed for investigating those risks. 
Only a small number of relevant events were identified after vaccination. No specific mechanism 
explaining a new onset or exacerbation of a pre-existing IMD after HZ/su exposure was found. 
Nevertheless this will be included as missing information and will be followed up by routine and 
enhanced surveillance (targeted follow up questionnaires). ZOSTER-069 has been proposed as a new 
study to address this safety concern, currently under feasibility assessment (the study protocol will be 
further discussed post-authorisation). 
ZOSTER-033 showed an overall acceptable reactogenicity/safety after vaccination of subjects with 
previous HZ, but a higher number of HZ cases than the recurrence rate generally reported in 
observational studies was observed. As the study was not designed to formally evaluate HZ recurrence 
(uncontrolled study with a limited sample size and no HZ cases confirmatory testing), it is not possible 
to conclude on the risk of triggering VZV reactivation in immunocompetent individuals with a history of 
HZ, which is thus added as an important potential risk in the RMP. Further data from well-designed 
studies are needed to make sure that HZ/su can be given safely to subject with history of HZ (studies 
ZOSTER-062 and ZOSTER-056, refer to sections 2.5.6 and 2.7).  
The limited available data about transplanted (haematologic) as well as HIV+ patients are reassuring 
showing no safety signals including for an increase incidence of pIMDs. Based on the available data the 
vaccine is well tolerated. More studies among patients suffering for malignancy and other IC patients 
including those <50 YOA are ongoing and will be assessed in the post-authorisation phase.  
The co-administration of HZ/su with D-QIV did not impact the reactogenicity or safety profile of HZ/su 
or D-QIV. The study did not reveal any safety concern. There are no data on co-administration with 
other vaccines. 
Maladministration of HZ/su via SC route may lead to an increase in transient local reactions.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the

2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The  general  safety  profile  of  HZ/su  is  acceptable.  The  main  pooled  safety  analysis  is  based  on  data 
from more than 14,000 subjects from different geographic regions who received the HZ/su vaccine in 
the  2  phase  III  pivotal  clinical  trials.  The  most  frequently  reported  adverse  reaction  were  pain  at  the 
injection  site  (68.1%  overall/dose),  myalgia  (32.9%  overall/dose),  fatigue  (32.2%  overall/dose), 
headache (26.3% overall/dose), fever (12.5% overall/dose) and gastrointestinal symptoms (including 
nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhoea  and/or  abdominal  pain  (10.7%  overall/dose).  The  majority  of  these 
reactions  were  of  mild  to  moderate  severity  and  were  not  long-lasting  (median  duration  of  2  to  3 
days).  Reactogenicity  did not  tend  to increase  by  dose.  Reactogenicity  of  HZ/su  was  slightly  lower  in 
the older age group (i.e. ≥70 years of age) compared with the younger one (50 to 69 years of age). 
The observed reactogenicity is not unexpected for an adjuvanted vaccine and the results do not raise 
any concern. Unsolicited AEs and SAEs did not indicate any cluster or specific pattern.  
SAEs, including fatal cases, were overall equally distributed between HZ/su group and placebo with a 
frequency  of  ~13%  for  all  SAEs  and  0.1%  for  related  SAEs  (as  per  investigator  assessment)  in  each 
group. The majority of SAEs, including fatal cases, occurred in ≥70 YOA and with time to onset longer 
than  one  year  after  last  vaccination,  and  mostly  appeared  to  be  associated  with  the  target/studied 
population’s  risk  factors  (e.g.  advanced  age).  On  basis  of  the  overall  results  with  a  mean  follow-up 
period  of  more  than  3  years  post-vaccination,  no  important  identified  risk  has  been  found  and  no 
safety concern is raised from SAEs data.   
pIMDs were equally distributed between HZ/su group and placebo, with a frequency of ~1% for all 
pIMDs and 0.1% for related pIMDs (as per investigator assessment) in each group. The incidence of 
pIMDs was balanced between age groups, and about half of the pIMDs occurred with time to onset 
longer than one year after last vaccination. The (theoretical) risk of acquiring a pIMD following HZ/su 
vaccination is included as important potential risk in the RMP. Routine and enhanced surveillance will 
follow up the risk post-authorisation; in addition a targeted safety study is planned (see below). 
Moreover possible exacerbation of pre-existing IMD after HZ/su vaccination needs further 
investigations in the post-marketing phase; hence it has been included as missing information in the 
RMP and will be followed up via routine and enhanced surveillance. In addition an immunogenicity and 
safety trial in adults with pre-existing pIMDs is planned (ZOSTER-069, currently under feasibility 
assessment).  
Furthermore a certain number of uncertainties persist. Safety data on a very limited number of 
immunocompromised subjects with HIV or haematopoietic stem cell transplant are available. The use 
of HZ/su in subjects with other confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient 
conditions is under investigation. As a consequence, the administration of HZ/su to 
immunocompromised subjects should be based on careful consideration of potential benefits and risks. 
There are very limited safety data to support use of HZ/su in subjects with a history of previous HZ. 
The risk of VZV reactivation following vaccination is included as potential risk in the RMP and more 
studies are planned. There are limited safety data subjects with underlying medical conditions 
including conditions associated with a higher risk of HZ. Also, there are limited safety data to support 
use of HZ/su in frail elderly subjects and in patients with immune mediated diseases. Vaccination 
should be considered on an individual basis. The use of the vaccine in all these subpopulations is 
included as missing information in the RMP and will be followed up via dedicated studies.  
Co-administration of unadjuvanted inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine did not impact the safety 
profile of HZ/su, but there is no data available on coadministration with other vaccines. The Applicant 
is recommended to submit for assessment the results of the ongoing/planned coadministration studies 
as soon as available (coadministration study with Pneumovax23 (ZOSTER-035), PVN13 (ZOSTER-059) 
and Boostrix (ZOSTER-042)). 
Assessment report

There is no safety data to support interchangeability of HZ/su with other HZ vaccines. A study ongoing 
at the time of this application investigated HZ/su vaccination of subjects who have previously received 
Zostavax (ZOSTER-048; data have recently become available and will be assessed post-authorisation).  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address safety concerns (missing information 
and important potential risks, see also section 2.7): 
•  Safety concern (important potential risk): risk of potential Immune Mediated Disorders: EPI-
ZOSTER-030 VS (targeted safety study); 
•  Safety concern (important potential risk): VZV reactivation in immunocompetent individuals with 
a history of herpes zoster: ZOSTER-062 and ZOSTER-056; 
•  Safety concern (missing information): Use of HZ/su in frail adults 50 YOA and older: studies 
ZOSTER-063 and ZOSTER-64; 
•  Safety concern (missing information): Use of HZ/su in immunocompromised adults: studies 
ZOSTER- ZOSTER-002, ZOSTER-028, ZOSTER-039 and ZOSTER-041;   
•  Safety concern (missing information): Use of HZ/su in adults with pre-existing pIMDs: study 
ZOSTER-069; 
•  Safety Concern (missing information): Long term follow up studies ZOSTER-049 and ZOSTER-060 
will provide more information on long term safety up to 10 years post-primary vaccination and on 
safety and reactogenicity after booster dose(s).

The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.0 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  Applicant  fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The Applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 13.10.2017. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The Applicant declared that Varicella Zoster virus glycoprotein E has not been previously authorised in 
a medicinal product in the European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers Varicella Zoster virus glycoprotein E to be a new 
active substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the 
Union.

2.10.  Product information 
During the procedure the CHMP contested the inclusion of HZ complications in the indication since 
complications of a disease are prevented as a consequence of the disease prevention, and as such 
there is no need to specifically include ‘prevention of complications’ in the indication. 
However in the case of PHN, intended as a complication of zoster disease (i.e. shingles), the CHMP 
agreed to explicitly list PHN in the indication of Shingrix, because of the peculiarity of vaccines for 
shingles and the strict link to PHN as the most common and disruptive complication of zoster, which 
drives the clinical use of vaccines authorised against zoster and is therefore one of the main objectives 
for such prophylactic intervention. The CHMP considered the expected impact of the wording of the 
indication on the appropriate use of this vaccine and to avoid misinterpretations.   
This decision was taken by majority. Some CHMP members were not in agreement with the majority 
view and their divergent positions are annexed to the Opinion.  
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
Applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Shingrix (Herpes zoster vaccine 
(recombinant, adjuvanted)) is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active 
substance, which on 1st January 2011 was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the 
EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Shingrix indication is for prevention of HZ and PHN in adults ≥50 YOA.  
The aim of a HZ prophylaxis is to provide a larger benefit in terms of protection in subjects from 50 
YOA onwards, especially in adults ≥ 70 YOA than offered by the currently available options. A 
reduction of the burden of HZ in adults ≥50 YOA (including ≥70 YOA) is expected, thus maintaining 
QoL. This is considered a better approach to management of this disease (rather than treatment of HZ 
and PHN) and to bring benefit from a health-economic perspective as well. 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 161/170 
 
  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The currently authorized HZ vaccine (Zostavax, Merck) demonstrated efficacy against HZ, but has 
some important limitations. Efficacy in preventing HZ in ≥60 YOA is moderate (51.3%), it is further 
reduced in ≥70 YOA (37.6%), the non-immunocompromised population at highest risk for both HZ and 
PHN, and it decreases over time. Since it is a live attenuated vaccine, it is contra-indicated in adults 
with immunosuppression or immunodeficiency due to the risk of vaccine-associated rash or 
disseminated disease.   
In countries where no HZ vaccine is marketed, no other preventive options are available. Antiviral 
treatment for HZ is available, but in order to be effective it should be given early after HZ onset. 
Although timely initiation (within 72 hours) of antiviral treatment has been shown to reduce the 
severity as well as the associated pain of an HZ episode, no curative therapy is currently available for 
the treatment of PHN once it occurred. Therefore, the HZ/su vaccine is being developed to better 
address the medical need to prevent HZ and HZ-related complications such as post-herpetic neuralgia 
(PHN) in older adults (≥50 YOA) and to address the unmet medical need to prevent HZ and HZ 
complications in IC adults ≥18 YOA (future development).  
The candidate vaccine has high efficacy and can be used in a broader target population than the 
currently available HZ vaccines. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy submitted was generated in the two phase III multicentre, randomized, 
observer-blind studies comparing HZ/su (n=14,645) vs. saline placebo (n=14,660) in adults ≥50 YOA.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Efficacy against HZ in adults ≥ 50 YOA (all ages from study ZOSTER-006) 
A total of 216 subjects reported a confirmed HZ episode, amongst which 6 were in the HZ/su group 
and 210 in the Placebo group. No subject reported more than one confirmed HZ episode. The mean 
(SD) follow-up time was 3.1 (0.5) years. The median (min - max) follow-up time was 3.1 (0 - 3.7) 
years. The overall incidence rate of HZ per 1000 person-years was 0.3 in the HZ/su group and 9.1 in 
the Placebo group. 
The overall HZ VE was 97.16% (95% CI: 93.72% - 98.97%; p-value < 0.0001) among participants 
who were ≥ 50 YOA. The primary objective of study ZOSTER-006 regarding HZ VE in subjects ≥50 
YOA was met as the LL of the 95% CI of the VE against HZ was above 25%. 
HZ VE was consistent across age strata: 
•  50-59 YOA: 96.57% (95% CI: 89.62% - 99.31%; p-value < 0.0001) 
•  60-69 YOA: 97.36% (95% CI: 90.14% - 99.69%; p-value < 0.0001) 
•  ≥70 YOA: 97.93% (95% CI: 87.91% - 99.95%; p-value < 0.0001) 
The secondary objective regarding HZ VE by age stratum was met for the 50-59 YOA and 60-69 YOA 
strata as the LL of the 95% CI of HZ VE was above 10%. Although the study was not powered for this, 
significant VE against HZ was demonstrated in subjects ≥70 YOA as the LL of the 95% CI for HZ VE 
was far above 10% for that age stratum. 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 162/170 
 
  
Efficacy against HZ in adults ≥70 YOA (pooled analysis) 
A total of 309 subjects reported a confirmed HZ episode, of which 25 were in the HZ/su group and 284 
in the Placebo group. No subject reported more than one confirmed HZ episode. The median (min - 
max) follow-up time was 4.0 (0 – 4.5) years. The overall efficacy against HZ ≥70 YOA was 91.3% 
(95% CI: 86.8% - 94.5%; P<0.0001). 
HZ VE was consistent across age strata: 
•  70-79 YOA: 91.3% (95% CI: 86.0% - 94.9%; P< 0.0001) 
•  ≥ 80 YOA: 91.4% (95% CI: 80.2 % - 97.0%; P< 0.0001) 
The overall incidence rate of HZ per 1000 person-years was 0.8 in the HZ/su group and 9.3 in the 
Placebo group for the pooled analysis ≥70 YOA.   
Efficacy against PHN in adults ≥50 YOA (all ages from study ZOSTER-006) 
Overall, VE against PHN was 100% (95% CI: 77.1; 100), and therefore demonstrated in adults ≥50 
YOA with no PHN cases in the HZ/su group vs. 18 in the Placebo group.  
The PHN VE observed for the two age strata was: 
•  50-59 YOA: 100% (95% CI: 40.8; 100), with no PHN cases in the HZ/su group and 8 in the 
Placebo group. Note that analysis was not powered for PHN VE by age strata, but as a result of 
the high VE against PHN reached in this age stratum the LL of the 95% CI was above 0.  
•  60-69 YOA: 100% (95% CI: <0; 100), with no PHN cases in the HZ/su group and 2 in the 
Placebo group. The LL of the 95% CI was <0 (not statistically significant) due to the low 
number of PHN cases observed in this age stratum. 
The overall incidence rate of PHN per 1000 persons-years was 0.0 in the HZ/su group and 0.6 in the 
Placebo group. 
Efficacy against PHN in adults ≥ 70 YOA (pooled analysis) 
Overall, VE against PHN was 88.78% (95% CI: 68.70 to 97.10), and therefore demonstrated in adults 
≥70 YOA with 4 PHN cases in the HZ/su group vs. 36 in the Placebo group.  
The PHN VE observed for both age strata was: 
•  70-79 YOA: 93.04% (95% CI: 72.47 to 99.19), with 2 PHN cases in the HZ/su group and 29 in 
the Placebo group. Note that pooled analysis was not powered for PHN VE by age strata, but as 
a result of the high VE against PHN reached in this age stratum, the LL of the 95% CI was also 
above 0%.  
•  ≥80 YOA: 71.16% (95% CI: -51.51 to 97.08). However, the LL of the 95% CI was <0% due to 
the low number of PHN cases observed in this age stratum, i.e. 2 PHN cases in the HZ/su 
group and 7 in the Placebo group. 
Results on VE against PHN in ≥70 YOA in the pooled analysis are consistent with ZOSTER-022, overall 
and by age stratum, and ZOSTER-006 EOS analysis. In the pooled analysis ≥70 YOA the overall 
incidence rate of PHN per 1000 persons-years was 0.1 in the HZ/su group and 1.2 in the Placebo 
group.  
Other aspects of efficacy 
In post-hoc analysis on pooled data, the vaccine significantly reduced the incidence of HZ associated 
vasculitis, disseminated disease, neurological disease and ophthalmic disease, with overall VE of 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 163/170 
 
  
93.71% in the ≥50 YOA and 91.62% in the ≥70 YOA. No cases of visceral disease or stroke associated 
with HZ reported during the study.  
The vaccine significantly reduced the use and the duration of HZ-associated pain medication by 39% 
(95% CI: 11.9; 63.3) and 50.6% (95% CI: 8.8; 73.2), respectively, in subjects ≥70 YOA (pooled 
data). The median duration of pain medication use was 32.0 and 44.0 days in the vaccine and placebo 
group, respectively.    
In subjects ≥70 years (pooled data), the vaccine significantly reduced the maximum worst pain score 
using ZBPI versus placebo over the entire HZ episode (mean = 5.7 vs. 7.0, P-value = 0.032). In 
addition, the vaccine significantly reduced the maximum average pain score versus placebo over the 
entire HZ episode (mean = 3.9 vs. 5.5, P-value = 0.049 and mean = 4.5 vs. 5.6, P-value = 0.043, in 
subjects ≥50 years (ZOSTER-006) and ≥70 years (ZOSTER-006 and -022 pooled), respectively).  
The AUC scores for severity-of-illness and severity-of-interference evaluated using ZBPI were 
significantly lower, overall and by age strata, in the vaccine group compared to placebo group. The 
estimated VE in pooled analysis in mitigating the BOI was 92.1% in ≥70 YOA, 95.1% in 70-79 YOA 
and 82.2% in ≥80 YOA. Similarly high efficacy in mitigating burden-of-interference was observed, 
overall and by age strata. 
Overall, the data obtained for the exploratory endpoints suggest lower severity of pain and burden of 
illness and a lower loss of QoL in the HZ/su group. 
In vaccinated subjects, 2 intramuscular doses of the vaccine on a 0, 2-month schedule elicited strong 
anti-gE ELISA titres (up to 42 median fold increase vs. pre-vaccination) and CMI responses to gE (up 
to 33 median fold increase vs. pre-vaccination) and VZV antigens, with elevated levels of induced 
immune response for up to 3 years post Dose 1 (more than 9 fold increase in anti-gE ELISA titres over 
pre-vaccination). The median anti-gE antibody concentration and the frequency of anti-gE specific CD4 
T cells decline over the years but remain almost stable from year 4 to year 6 after vaccination (greater 
than 7 and 3.7-fold above baseline pre-vaccination, respectively). Immune responses to the 0,6-month 
schedule were non-inferior to immune responses to the 0,2-months schedule, for which efficacy was 
demonstrated. 
The vaccine was shown to be immunogenic in a limited number of IC adults (135 HCT and HIV+ 
patients). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Frail patients including those with multiple comorbidities seem to be under-represented in the pivotal 
trials, especially in the oldest age categories. Frailty has not been taken into account at enrolment and 
was not monitored during the study period. Information concerning vaccine efficacy in frail patients is 
limited; however two studies are planned in frail subjects >50 YOA.  
Efficacy against HZ complications was based on a post-hoc analysis of limited power. No cases of 
visceral disease, stroke associated with HZ or ZSH were reported during the pivotal study. Whether the 
vaccine can be effective in preventing these zoster complications remains open question. The Applicant 
is currently investigating the feasibility of an effectiveness study with respect to the evaluation of the 
impact of the vaccine on HZ-related complications.  
No demonstrative efficacy was seen against PHN occurrence in breakthrough cases due to insufficient 
power of the trials due to the high efficacy of the vaccine against HZ. However, given the overall body 
of data on VE agains PHN in overall population, VE against PHN in HZ-breakthrough cases is considered 
as supportive but not essential for the granting of the indication, also in view of the methodological 
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 164/170 
 
  
complications that would render this approach unfeasible in terms of attaining statistical significance. 
More data on these aspects can be generated from the planned effectiveness study and the long term 
efficacy studies.  
Long term efficacy and persistence of immune responses as well as need and timing of additional 
doses is not established. However, two long-term follow-up efficacy and immunogenicity studies will 
evaluate these aspects.  
Efficacy data in immunocompromised is limited at this stage to HIV+ and HCT patients but the vaccine 
was shown to be immunogenic. The clinical development is still ongoing including individuals down to 
18YOA and 4 more studies are planned in different conditions. 
Individuals with a history of HZ, excluded from the pivotal clinical trials, were investigated in one small 
non-controlled study. The vaccine was shown to be immunogenic but the number of HZ cases was 
higher than expected, although the study has many limitations so no conclusion can be drawn. More 
data is expected from 2 ongoing/planned studies (see also section 3.5).  
There were no efficacy data against HZ generated for the 0, 6-month schedule, and no CMI data. 
Overall, the inclusion of the 0,6 month schedule in the SmPC is considered acceptable based on the 
available humoral immunogenicity data. However, due to the limitations of these data, the 0,2 month 
schedule is preferable. If flexibility in the vaccination schedule is necessary, the second dose can be 
administered between 2 and 6 months after the first dose. 
A correlate of protection has not been established. However, post-dose 2 anti-gE antibodies can be 
used for immunobridging, as it was done in immunocompetent individuals ≥50 years of age and for 
coadministration studies, based on the evidence that robust immune response are generated following 
vaccination.  
There is no information on use of Shingrix in VZV naïve individuals or individuals previously vaccinated 
against varicella. This will be followed up by routine pharmacovigilance. One study investigated HZ/su 
vaccination of subjects who have previously received Zostavax but data have only recently become 
available and will be assessed post-authorisation. There are no safety, immunogenicity or efficacy data 
to support replacing a dose of Shingrix with a dose of another HZ vaccine, so this is not recommended.  
Immunogenicity data on coadministration with other vaccines is limited to the quadrivalent 
unadjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine; three more studies are ongoing to investigate 
coadministration with polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine, PCV13 and DTaP vaccine.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Nature and incidence of recorded local and general AEs are in line with what can be expected from an 
adjuvanted vaccine. Based on a main safety pooled analysis on 14,645 adults ≥50 YOA who have 
received at least one dose of Shingrix, the most frequently reported adverse reactions after vaccination 
were pain at the injection site (68.1% overall/dose; 3.8% grade 3/dose), myalgia (32.9% 
overall/dose; 2.9% grade 3/dose), fatigue (32.2% overall/dose; 3.0% grade 3/dose) and headache 
(26.3% overall/dose; 1.9% grade 3/dose). Other very common adverse reactions were injections site 
redness/swelling, chills, fever and gastrointestinal symptoms (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea 
and/or abdominal pain). More than 90% of these reactions were of mild to moderate severity and were 
not long-lasting (median duration of 2 to 3 days). Severe (grade 3) reactions lasted 1-2 days. Data 
showed a higher reactogenicity within the youngest age strata as compared to those >70 YOA, 
especially for solicited grade 3 (severe) general symptoms. The overall reactogenicity did not tend to 
increase by dose.    
Assessment report  
EMA/88588/2018 
Page 165/170 
 
  
Overall, there was neither imbalance nor medically relevant clusters of serious adverse events in the 
HZ/su group compared to the Placebo group. No safety signal has been detected. Co-administration of 
Shingrix with unadjuvanted inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine did not impact the safety profile of 
Shingrix (see below). Maladministration via SC route may lead to an increase in transient local 
reactions. Shingrix has shown a clinically acceptable safety profile when administered to a limited 
number of immunocompromised adults (see below).   
Overall, based on a large safety database from controlled clinical trials (15,493 individuals in the 
broader safety pooling) with an average follow up time of about 3 years, Shingrix showed an 
acceptable safety profile and good tolerability in adults ≥50 years of age.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Pending further investigation (four more trials are ongoing including individuals down to 18YOA), only 
limited safety data are available in immunocompromised subjects with HIV or haematopoietic stem cell 
transplant. Although the vaccines showed an acceptable safety profile in HIV+ and HCT patients, due 
to the limitation of the data the administration of Shingrix to immunocompromised subjects should be 
based on careful consideration of potential benefits and risks. 
There is limited safety data to support the use of Shingrix in individuals with a history of HZ and the 
study has methodological limitations, so the theoretical risk of VZV reactivation in immunocompetent 
individuals with a history of HZ is included in the RMP as important potential risk. One specific study is 
planned (ZOSTER-062 - placebo controlled study) and another one will provide additional information 
(ZOSTER-056).  
There are limited safety data to support the use of Shingrix in individuals with frailty or with multiple 
underlying medical conditions, including conditions associated with a higher risk of HZ. The uncertainty 
is mostly linked to aspects of frailty such as immunosenescence, immune dysregulation and 
inflammation. Two studies are planned to investigate safety and reactogenicity by frailty status. 
The data in patients with immune mediated diseases show no safety signal for a new pIMD onset after 
vaccination or for exacerbation of a pre-existing pIMD, but it is considered limited, also considering the 
incidence of these diseases. Thus the risk of pIMDs is reflected as safety concern (important potential 
risk) in the RMP, and it will be followed by routine pharmacovigilance and by a study. Another study is 
planned in individual with existing pIMDs with or without immunosuppressive treatment. 
Vaccination should be considered on an individual basis in population for which limited data are 
available.  
There are no safety data to support interchangeability of Shingrix with other HZ vaccines, so this is not 
recommended. Safety data on the use of Shingrix in subjects who have previously received Zostavax 
have only recently become available (to be assessed post-authorisation).  
Three studies are ongoing/planned to investigate safety of coadministration of Shingrix with other 
vaccines (Pneumovax23, Boostrix and Prevenar13). Until this data become available coadministration 
is not recommended. 
Safety and reactogenicity of booster dose(s) and long term safety are not established and will be 
investigated post-authorisation in 2 long term follow up studies up to 10 years post-primary 
vaccination.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Shingrix has shown high efficacy against HZ and PHN in adults ≥50 YOA and consistently in all age 
strata with only slight decrease with age and time until around 4 years post-vaccination. Due to this 
high efficacy, the evidence in support of VE against other HZ-related complications and against PHN in 
breakthrough cases is limited or absent. The duration of VE against HZ and PHN beyond 4 years and 
the need for a booster dose in case of waning efficacy is unknown. These aspects should be further 
evaluated post-licensure via long term efficacy follow-up and effectiveness studies.  
The true magnitude of the protective effect could potentially be smaller in real life than that estimated 
in the pivotal trials due to identified uncertainties regarding the study populations in terms of 
comorbidities, frailty and underlying auto-immune disorders.  
The use of Shingrix in subjects immunocompromised (IC) is possible although at the moment there is 
limited efficacy and safety data available to support a specific recommendation for use, pending 
ongoing studies.  
Severe reactogenicity was not uncommon. Even if reactogenicity in terms of headache, fatigue, fever 
might have debilitating effects in particular in frail elderly, or individuals suffering from underlying 
comorbidities, most adverse reactions are temporary and could be managed by standard medical care.    
The submitted data did not reveal a higher incidence of pIMDs in the vaccine group compared with the 
placebo group. However, the power of pre-licensure clinical trials to detect very rare events such as 
new onset of autoimmune disease is limited due to the sample size, since incidence rates of different 
autoimmune diseases vary roughly from 1 to 20/100,000 per year. The (theoretical) risk of acquiring a 
vaccine induced pIMDs following HZ/su vaccination will be followed up post-licensure.  
Only limited data from a study with methodological limitations are available for subjects with previous 
history of HZ, based on which it is not possible to conclude on the potential risk of HZ recurrence,

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The main aim of HZ/su is to prevent HZ infection and HZ-related complications in the population ≥50 
years of age having an increased risk of developing HZ due to immunosenescence. Clear evidence for 
high vaccine efficacy against HZ, overall by treatment group and by age strata, is given. As a 
consequence of HZ prevention, a highly reduced PHN incidence was demonstrated overall and by age 
strata including in the older age groups. Shingrix can be used in immunocompromised individuals.  
Based on the available safety data in over 15,000 HZ/su vaccine recipients, it can be concluded that 
there is no major safety concern related to the use of Shingrix in the target population (adults ≥50 
YOA). There is no important identified risk and there are two important potential risks included in the 
RMP: pIMDs (theoretical risk considered for all vaccines containing adjuvant systems) and use in 
subjects with a history of HZ (potential reactivation of VZV). The reactogenicity and safety profile of 
HZ/su is considered acceptable in the target population.  
It is therefore considered that the high vaccine efficacy largely outweighs the unfavourable effects 
linked mainly to reactogenicity as no important risks were otherwise identified. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Shingrix is positive. 
The divergent positions are appended to the opinion. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority 
decision that the risk-benefit balance of Shingrix is favourable in the following indication: 
“Shingrix is indicated for prevention of herpes zoster (HZ) and post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults 
50 years of age or older (see section 5.1).  
The use of Shingrix should be in accordance with official recommendations.” 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Official batch release 
In accordance with Article 114 Directive 2001/83/EC, the official batch release will be undertaken by a 
state laboratory or a laboratory designated for that purpose.

Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result 
of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Not applicable. 
Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures 
Not applicable 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States. 
Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that Varicella Zoster virus 
glycoprotein E is a new active substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously 
authorised within the European Union.

Divergent Position 
The undersigned members of CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s opinion recommending the granting 
of a Marketing Authorisation for Shingrix. 
The reasons for divergent opinion were as follows: 
The undersigned members of CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s opinion recommending the final 
wording of the indication for use of Shingrix, granted for prevention of herpes zoster (HZ) and post-
herpetic neuralgia (PHN) in adults 50 years of age or older. 
The reason for the divergent opinion relates to the inclusion of prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia in 
the indication statement. This is for the following reasons: 
It is not agreed that PHN is an integral part of shingles. It is a sequela of clinically apparent shingles 
that affects a proportion of patients. It is intuitive that a medicinal product that is highly efficacious in 
preventing a disease will also prevent the complications and sequelae of that disease. It is not usual 
for the indication statements of vaccines to refer to the complications of an infectious disease, the 
occurrence of which will obviously be reduced by preventing the disease in the first place. 
Consequently, an indication statement specifically for prevention of PHN logically refers to 
breakthrough cases of HZ that occur despite vaccination. Granting of such an indication is not 
supported by evidence. Shingrix is a highly efficacious vaccine against shingles. Thus, with very few 
breakthrough cases, the data available cannot support a conclusion that the vaccine prevents PHN in 
breakthrough cases. It is acknowledged that the data do suggest that it ameliorates the acute disease 
in breakthrough cases. This is not unexpected since licensed vaccines against primary HZ infection are 
well known to reduce the number of lesions and shorten the course of the disease in breakthrough 
cases. This fact alone is not evidence for prevention of PHN.  
The fact that another authorised vaccine for HZ includes prevention of PHN in the wording of its 
indication is not considered an argument to do the same for Shingrix. As mentioned, this needs to be 
seen in context of the individual efficacy profiles and in the case of a relatively ineffective vaccine, 
enough breakthrough cases observed to support a conclusion that vaccination reduced the incidence of 
PHN in the breakthrough cases.

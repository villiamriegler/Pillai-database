1.  Introduction  
On 29th of November 2021, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study MS100070-0306 report 
for Bavencio (avelumab), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion  
2.1.  Information on the development program  
The MAH stated that study MS100070-0306 () is part of a clinical paediatric development program for 
Bavencio. The initial avelumab PIP was agreed on 17-Mar-17 (P/0071/2017).  
Here Study MS100070-0306 is presented as a stand-alone study based on the phase I part. The phase 
II was removed due to failure of avelumab monotherapy to lead to objective responses for the solid 
tumours tested in phase I. This discontinuation was part of agreed avelumab PIP modification. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study  
Avelumab was administered as an intravenous infusion. Dose was adjusted based on weight. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects  
2.3.1.  Introduction  
The MAH submitted a final report for study MS100070-0306 
2.3.2.  Clinical study – MS100070-0306  
Description  
This was a multicenter, open-label, international, Phase I/II study to evaluate the dose, safety and 
tolerability, antitumour activity, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamics of avelumab in 
paediatric subjects from birth to less than 18 years of age with refractory or relapsed solid tumours 
and lymphoma. The study was intended to consist of 2 parts: the dose-finding part (Phase I) and the 
tumour-specified expansion part (Phase II). The study was finished after dose-finding part (Phase I). 
Phase II was cancelled due to limited clinical benefit of PD-L1 monotherapy in paediatric patients. This 
discontinuation was part of agreed avelumab PIP modification. 
Methods  
Study participants  
Paediatric subjects aged 0 to < 18 years of age with refractory or relapsed malignant solid tumours 
(including central nervous system [CNS] tumours) and lymphoma for which no standard therapy is 
available or for which the subject was not eligible for the existing therapy.

Treatments  
Avelumab was administered once every 2 weeks (duration of 1 cycle was 14 days) until confirmed 
progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or any criterion for withdrawal occurred. 
Subjects received an intravenous infusion of avelumab over 1 hour (− 10 minutes/+ 20 minutes, i.e., 
50 to 80 minutes) once every 2 weeks. The subject received either 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg of avelumab 
dose. The dose of avelumab was calculated based on the weight of the subject determined within 72 
hours prior to administration. The dose of avelumab used for the previous administration could have 
been repeated if the change in the subject’s weight was within 10% of the weight used for the previous 
dose calculation.  
Premedication with an antihistamine (H1 receptor blocker such as diphenhydramine) and paracetamol 
for the first 4 doses was mandatory in all subjects treated with avelumab. 
Subjects received treatment with avelumab until confirmed progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, 
or any criterion for withdrawal occurred. Subjects who would have experienced complete response 
(CR) were to be treated for a minimum of 12 months based on clinical judgment of benefit and/or until 
confirmed progression per immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (irRECIST), 
unacceptable toxicity, or any criterion for withdrawal occurred, after confirmation of response. 
The most commonly used concomitant medications were paracetamol, fentanyl and furosemide.

Sample size  
Between 12 and 36 subjects were planned to be enrolled in the Phase I part of the study, depending  
on the required dose-escalation steps according to the Bayesian design. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking)  
Non-randomized study.  
Statistical Methods  
All statistical summaries were descriptive in nature. 
Descriptive statistics were used for PK parameters.  
Results  
Participant flow and recruitment  
First subjects first dose was administrated 19 March 2018 and last subject last visit for Phase I was 31 
May 2021. 
A total of 26 subjects were screened for participation in the Phase I part of the study. A total of 21 
subjects were enrolled and received at least 1 dose of study treatment; 6 subjects in the avelumab 10 
mg/kg treatment group and 15 subjects in the avelumab 20 mg/kg treatment group. As PK exposure 
in the first 6 paediatric subjects was lower than expected, compared with the adult exposure, the 
Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) agreed that the dose should be escalated to 20 mg/kg for the next 
cohort of subjects. At the final analysis (data cut-off date 27 July 2021) for the Phase I part of the 
study, all 21 subjects had discontinued the study treatment.

Baseline data  
There was a similar number of male and female subjects in the Phase I part of the study (52.4% and 
47.6%, respectively). The majority of the subjects were Asian (71.4%) and the subjects’ age ranged 
from 3 to 17 years (median of 12 years). A similar proportion of subjects were in age category of 1 to 
12 years (52.4%) and >12 years (47.6%). Overall, the mean Lansky performance status and 
Karnofsky performance status was 77.5 and 90.0, respectively. 
The primary tumour categories were soft tissue/bone sarcoma (12 subjects [57.1%]), CNS (8 subjects 
[38.1%]), and GI (1 subject [4.8%]). One subject with primary GI tumours was enrolled in the study 
and was included in the avelumab 10 mg/kg dose group, while all 8 subjects with CNS tumours were 
included in the avelumab 20 mg/kg dose group. 
The median time from initial cancer diagnosis to first avelumab dose was 22.24 months (minimum: 4.3 
months; maximum: 168.0 months). For subjects with metastatic disease (14 subjects [66.7%]), there 
was some variation in the time from metastatic disease to first avelumab dose, with a median time of 
10.33 months (minimum: 0.3 months; maximum: 53.5 months). 
All subjects (100.0%) had at least 1 prior anticancer surgery and 10 subjects (47.6%) had at least 1 
prior radiotherapy. All subjects (100.0%) had received at least 1 prior anticancer drug therapy with 9 
subjects (42.9%) having had ≥ 4 prior anticancer drug therapy regimens. All subjects had received 
cytotoxic therapy, 2 subjects (9.5%) had targeted therapy, 1 subject (4.8%) had monoclonal 
antibodies therapy, and 1 subject (4.8%) had therapy recorded as “other.  
The majority of the subjects in both the treatment groups had negative status for PD-L1 expression 
(n=11). Among those who tested positive for PD-L1 expression, 5 subjects were positive at the ≥1% 
cutoff, 4 subjects at the ≥ 5% cutoff, 3 subjects at the ≥ 25% cutoff, 2 subjects at the ≥ 50% cutoff, 
and 2 subjects at the ≥ 80% cutoff.  
Number analysed  
All 21 subjects (100.0%) who received study treatment were included in the FAS, SAF, PK Analysis 
Set, Biomarker Analysis Set, and Immunogenicity Analysis Set.  
A total of 18 subjects (85.7%) were included in the DLT Analysis Set, defined as subjects who received 
all study treatment administrations in the DLT evaluation period (first 2 cycles of treatment) or stopped 
treatment because of DLTs in the DLT evaluation period. One subject was not included in the DLT 
Analysis Set because the subject received only 1 dose due to an AE. Of the 3 subjects not included in 
the DLT Analysis Set, 2 subjects were considered not to be DLT evaluable during the study conduct 
since 2 subjects did not complete the DLT observation period (28-day period [2 cycles] beginning with 
the first avelumab administration) and 1 subject was considered not to be DLT evaluable because he 
stopped due to early PD before second study drug administration. All three subjects were replaced in 
the respective dose cohort in agreement with the SMC.  
Pharmacokinetic results  
A previously validated ligand binding assay was used for the quantification of avelumab. In the 
bioanalytical study report, it is stated that method is based on method. Validation report. QCs, 
calibration standards and the incurred sample reproducibility performed within preset criteria in the 
within study validation. Study samples were analysed within their long-term storage stability.  
There were no important protocol deviations affecting PK. No subjects were excluded from PK Analysis. 
Based on safety and preliminary PK exposure data in the 10 mg/kg group, it was recommended by the 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/155892/2022

SMC to escalate the dose to 20 mg/kg. PK parameters and the corresponding PK profiles are 
summarised by dose for all patients as well as stratified by bodyweight in Table 1 and Figure 1. 
Subjects who received 10 mg/kg weighed 18.5 to 65.6 kg and subjects who received 20 mg/kg 
weighed 13.4 to 78.7 kg. Since only 1 subject in both 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg groups was positive for 
ADA, no conclusions could be made on association between ADA status and PK.

No statistical analysis for PK parameters was performed, but the applicant notes some trends in PK 
exposures in Cycle 1:  
-  A trend of lower exposure in paediatric subjects with body weight of < 40 kg compared to 
those with body weight ≥ 40 kg at the same dose level in both 10 and 20 mg/kg once every 2 
weeks dose groups was observed.  
- 
In paediatric subjects with body weight ≥ 40 kg, there was an approximately dose-proportional 
increase in Cycle 1 median/geometric mean exposures (Cmax, AUC, and Ctrough) from 10 to 
20 mg/kg once every 2 weeks. In paediatric subjects with body weight of < 40 kg, there was a 
trend of a more than dose-proportional increase in median/geometric mean AUC and Ctrough 
at the same dose level.  
-  No evidence of association between age and exposure was observed.

-  Geometric mean Cycle 1 AUC and Ctrough in the 10 mg/kg dose group with dosing once every 
2 weeks appeared lower compared with those in adults at the approved dose (10 mg/kg or 800 
mg once every 2 weeks [Novakovic 2020]), especially in subjects with body weight < 40 kg. 
Median/geometric mean Cycle 1 AUC and Ctrough in the 20 mg/kg dose group were similar or 
higher compared with those in adults at the approved dose, regardless of body weight.  
- 
The PK profile in the subject who had a DLT at 20 mg/kg was similar to PK profiles in other 
subjects in the 20 mg/kg once every 2 weeks dose group.  
-  No consistent trend in change in Ctrough or CEOI over time was observed in the subjects 
remaining on treatment beyond Cycle 1.  
Efficacy results  
None of the subjects in the avelumab 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg dose groups had a CR or PR, therefore 
the ORR was 0 (95% CI: 0.0, 45.9 and 0.0, 21.8 for each dose level, respectively)  
Four subjects (26.7%) in the 20 mg/kg dose group had BOR of stable disease (SD); all had tumours in 
the CNS category. Three subjects with CNS tumours had sustained SD for at least 6 months. Two 
subjects experienced a long term stabilization of at least 25 months. All other subjects, regardless of 
dose level, had BOR of PD or were NE.  
Safety results  
The median duration of therapy was over 8 weeks for subjects in the avelumab 10 mg/kg dose group 
and nearly 12 weeks for subjects in the avelumab 20 mg/kg dose group. The median number of infusions 
was 4.0 and 6.0 for avelumab 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg dose groups, respectively. The majority of subjects 
received between 90% and < 110% of the planned dose per cycle. No subjects received ≥ 110% of the 
planned dose. 
One subject  (8.3%)  in  the  avelumab 20 mg/kg  dose  group  experienced  3  events  (fatigue, 
hemiparesis, and muscular weakness) that were identified by the SMC as a DLT. The MTD was not 
reached in paediatric subjects. 
At least 1 TEAE was reported in all subjects treated  in  the  study,  including  3  subjects  (50.0%)  in 
the  avelumab  10 mg/kg  dose  group  and 10 subjects (66.7%) in the avelumab 20 mg/kg dose group 
with at least 1 treatment-related TEAE.  
Five subjects (83.3%) in the avelumab 10 mg/kg dose group and 11 subjects (73.3%) in the avelumab 
20 mg/kg dose group experienced at least 1 Grade ≥ 3 TEAE; of these, only 1 subject (20 mg/kg dose 
group) experienced Grade 3 TEAEs considered by the Investigator to be treatment- -related  
At least 1 serious TEAE was reported in 4 subjects (66.7%) in the avelumab 10 mg/kg dose group and 
12 subjects (80.0%) in the avelumab 20 mg/kg dose group, including 2 subjects (13.3%) in the 
avelumab 20 mg/kg dose group with at least 1 serious treatment-related TEAE. 
Treatment-emergent AEs  that led to death were reported for 1 subject (16.7%) in the avelumab 10 
mg/kg dose group and 3 subjects (20.0%) in the avelumab 20 mg/kg dose group. All TEAEs that  led 
to  death  had  PT  as  disease  progression  and  none  was  considered  related  to  treatment. 
None of the subjects in the avelumab 10 mg/kg dose group and 8 subjects (53.3%) in the avelumab 20 
mg/kg dose group permanently discontinued treatment due to TEAEs; of these 5 TEAEs were      reported 
as disease progression and 3 TEAEs as thrombocytopenia, malignant pleural effusion, and intracranial

hypertension, which were related to disease progression. None of the subjects discontinued avelumab 
due to a treatment-related TEAE. 
At the final analysis for Phase I part of the study, 4 subjects (66.7%) in the avelumab 10 mg/kg dose 
group and 12 subjects (80.0%) in the avelumab 20 mg/kg dose group had at least 1 serious TEAE. 
Disease progression and pyrexia were the most commonly reported serious TEAEs in avelumab 20 
mg/kg dose group. In the avelumab 10 mg/kg dose group, serious TEAEs reported were in the form of 
single case reports only. 
There were no treatment-emergent irAEs of Grade ≥ 3, serious irAEs, irAEs leading to permanent study 
treatment discontinuation, or irAEs leading to death. One subject experienced an irAE. The subject, a 6 
year-old female with a CNS primary tumour (atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumour), experienced an irAE of 
Grade 2 hypothyroidism that started on Study Day 42, and was considered related to study treatment. 
No stop date is recorded for the irAE. The subject received 6 infusions of avelumab 20 mg/kg prior to 
discontinuing study treatment due to PD on Day 84. 
There were no treatment-emergent IRRs of Grade ≥ 3, serious IRRs, IRRs leading to permanent study 
treatment discontinuation, or IRRs leading to death. In avelumab 10 mg/kg group, 1 subject had IRRs 
after Infusion 1 and Infusion 3, and 1 subject after Infusion 4 or later. In the avelumab 20 mg/kg dose 
group, 5 subjects had a first onset after the first Infusion, 1 subject after Infusion 2, 1 subject after 
Infusion 16 and Infusion 17. Infusion-related reactions were: chills, pyrexia, infusion-related reaction, 
urticaria, and hypotension. 
Immunogenicity 
Blood samples for antidrug antibodies (ADA) assessments (including neutralizing antibodies [nAbs]) 
were collected predose (within 2 hours prior to study treatment) as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments. If the sample was positive for ADA, it was re-analyzed and tested for neutralizing 
capacity. 
A previously validated homogeneous bridging assay was used.. For the analysis of study samples, a 
cutpoint determined in solid tumour patients was used Similarly, study report  for nAb used the 
previously validated method, which had increased drug tolerance compared to earlier methods. Twelve 
(12) individual paediatric human serum lots were analysed to determine whether the adult cutpoint 
was appropriate. All neat individuals screened negative (100%). All individuals spiked at the LPC () and 
the HPC () screened positive (100%). Therefore, it is concluded that the cutpoint determined curing 
validation (0.919) is sufficient. 
In the avelumab 10 mg/kg group, only 1 subject (16.7%) had treatment emergent persistent positive 
ADA results with a titer of. None out of the 15 (0.0%) of the 20 mg/kg subjects were positive for ADA.  
In the avelumab 10 mg/kg group, only 1 subject (16.7%) had treatment emergent persistent positive 
nAb result. None of the 15 (0.0%) of the 20 mg/kg subjects were positive for nAb. 
Of the 21 subjects treated in the study, 1 subject in the 10 mg/kg group had treatment-emergent 
persistent positive ADA and treatment emergent persistent positive nAb result. 
MAH’s overall conclusion  
Exposures with 20 mg/kg dosing once every 2 weeks were similar or higher compared to those in 
adults at the approved dose (10 mg/kg or 800 mg once every 2 weeks). In contrast, exposures with 
10 mg/kg dosing once every 2 weeks in children in lower body weight category were lower compared 
to those at the approved dose in adults.

While the MTD in paediatric subjects was not reached and both the 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg dose levels 
were well tolerated, further clinical studies with avelumab monotherapy (including Phase II) are not 
recommended due to the lack of clinical activity observed in different tumour types. Therefore, an 
RP2D for monotherapy studies was not determined.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects  
In study MS100070-0306 avelumab monotherapy was investigated in paediatric subjects aged 0 to < 
18 years of age with refractory or relapsed malignant solid tumours (including central nervous system 
[CNS] tumours) and lymphoma for which no standard therapy is available or for which the subject was 
not eligible for the existing therapy.  
In total, 21 patients with soft tissue/bone sarcoma (12 subjects [57.1%]), CNS (8 subjects [38.1%]), 
and GI (1 subject [4.8%]) was included in phase I. Patients received either 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg of 
avelumab every 2 weeks. 
Analytical methods for avelumab, ADAs and nAb were previously deemed acceptable however more 
information about QPS Validation report is needed. 
As noted in the EPAR of the initial MAA, in adult patients, the mean avelumab concentration was 252 
μg/mL (range 107 to 1108 μg/mL) at the end of infusion and 23.8 μg/ml (range 1.58 to 245 μg/mL) at 
trough after the first dose. In adult patients given 10 mg/kg, the mean PK parameters after the first 
dose were the following: Cmax 310 µg/mL, Ctrough 24 µg/mL, AUC0-336h 25900 hr*µg/mL.  
Very few patients are included, therefore data should be interpreted with caution. The applicant´s view 
that exposure after the first administration was lower in paediatric patients given 10 mg/kg than the 
reference exposure in adults is agreed, however paediatric patients given 20 mg/kg had a consistently 
higher exposure than the adult reference interval. The higher exposure did not translate to efficacy in 
paediatric patients.  
Immunogenicity was in line with available data from adult patients.  
No objective responses were recorded in the phase I part of the study. Hence, the phase II part of the 
study was not started.  
The safety results presented are limited due to the low number of included patients precluding any firm 
conclusions. The MTD was not reached and only 1 DLT was recorded. However, the overall safety 
profile appears to be as expected from the known safety profile of avelumab. No new safety concern 
was identified.  
Currently, the Bavencio SmPC states the following regarding paediatric use: 
Section 4.2:  
Paediatric population  
The safety and efficacy of Bavencio in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not been 
established. 
According to Articles 16 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, results from paediatric studies, even 
when there is lack of activity, should be included in the SmPC to provide guidance for the prescribers. 
Therefore, unless otherwise justified, the SmPC section 5.1, and other applicable sections, should be 
updated with a brief description of the results of study MS100070-0306.

3.  Overall conclusion and recommendation  
 Fulfilled:  
In view of the available data regarding avelumab in paediatric patients with refractory or relapsed solid 
tumours and lymphoma the MAH should either submit a variation in accordance with Articles 16 and 17 
of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 or provide a justification for not doing so. This should be provided 
without any delay and no later than 60 days after the receipt of these conclusions. 
•  Section 4.2 should be amended with a reference to section 5.1 
•  Section 5.1 of the SmPC should be updated with a brief description of the results of MS100070-
0306 (number of patients, the diagnoses and that no responses were seen) 
•  Section 5.2 of the SmPC should be updated with the doses and exposures reached in paediatric 
patients, as compared to adult patients.  
•  Validation report 218-1823 for avelumab should be provided.

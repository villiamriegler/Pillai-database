2.  Grounds for the COMP opinions 
EU/3/14/1372 
The COMP considered that the sponsor has established the following: 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing (2R,3S)-2-(4-
cyclopentylaminophenyl)-1-(2-fluoro-6-methylbenzoyl)piperidine-3-carboxylic acid(4-methyl-3-
trifluoromethylphenyl)amide was considered justified based on preclinical data in a relevant model 
of the disease and preliminary clinical data in patients with the condition indicating improvement in 
renal disease; 
 the condition is chronically debilitating due to the progressive affection of the respiratory tract and 
kidneys and life-threatening due to the risk of renal- and respiratory failure, as well as infections 
and malignancies as a consequence of available treatments; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting not more than 1 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made. 
EU/3/14/1373 
The COMP considered that the sponsor has established the following: 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing (2R,3S)-2-(4-
cyclopentylaminophenyl)-1-(2-fluoro-6-methylbenzoyl)piperidine-3-carboxylic acid(4-methyl-3-
trifluoromethylphenyl)amide was considered justified based on preliminary clinical data in patients 
with the condition indicating improvement in renal disease and reduced overall vasculitis activity; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to progressive affection of the respiratory tract and 
kidneys and life-threatening due to the risk of renal- and respiratory failure, as well as infections 
and malignancies as a consequence of available treatments; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 1.6 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
•  Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) 
Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) is an anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis 
that affects small to medium vessels (2012 Revised International Chapel Hill Consensus Conference 
Nomenclature of Vasculitides, Jenette et al, 2013). MPA may affect any organ, with a predilection for 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
Page 6/12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the kidneys. MPA can be distinguished from other forms of small vessel vasculitides by the absence of 
granuloma formation, and the predominance of perinuclear ANCA staining by immunofluorescence and 
positive testing, predominantly for the myeloperoxidase (MPO) antigen. In contrast to other ANCA-
associated vasulites, in particular granulomatosis with polyangiitis, MPA spares the upper respiratory 
tract. 
MPA is an auto-immune disease with unknown aetiology. Environmental factors, such as 
Staphylococcus infections or exposure to silica dust, as well as genetic susceptibility have been 
discussed with HLA-DQ being a candidate gene among MPA patients. The peak age of onset is 65 to 74 
years, men are slightly more often affected than women (1.5 : 1.0). Signs and symptoms comprise 
renal disease (haematuria and urinary RBC casts, albuminuria, decreased eGFR, hypertension, and 
sometimes as acute renal failure), pulmonary disease (infiltrates, cavitary lesions, pulmonary 
haemorrhage, and rarely bronchial stenosis), gastro-intestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhoea, and bloody stools), episcleritis, constitutional symptoms, fever, arthralgias, 
purpura, and neurologic disease (peripheral neuropathy, cerebral vasculitis). Renal disease occurs in 
around 80% of patients. 
Diagnosis is based on presenting signs and symptoms, serology (positive cANCA antibody titers: anti-
MPO antibodies in up to 75% of patients), chest X rays, and often renal biopsy (pauci-immune 
necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis). Disease activity is monitored using the Birmingham 
Vasculitis Activity Score and the Vasculitis Damage Index (Mukhtyar et al, 2009; Exley et al, 1998; 
Luqmani et al, 1994). 
•  Granulomatosis with polyangitis (GPA) 
Granulomatosis with polyangitis (GPA) is an anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated 
vasculitis that affects small to medium vessels (2012 Revised International Chapel Hill Consensus 
Conference Nomenclature of Vasculitides, Jenette et al, 2013). Classically, GPA is characterised by 
granulomatous inflammation of the upper and lower respiratory tract, necrotizing vasculitis, and 
nephritis (known as ‘Wegener’s triad’, as the condition was previously named Wegener’s 
granulomatosis). GPA may affect any organ, with a predilection for the upper and lower respiratory 
tracts and the kidneys. 
GPA is an auto-immune disease with unknown aetiology. Environmental factors, such as 
Staphylococcus infections or exposure to silica dust, as well as genetic susceptibility have been 
discussed with HLA DPB1*0401 being candidate gene among European GPA patients. The peak age of 
onset is 65 to 74 years, men are slightly more often affected than women (1.5 : 1.0). Signs and 
symptoms comprise renal disease (hematuria and urinary RBC casts, albuminuria, decreased eGFR, 
hypertension and sometimes as acute renal failure), pulmonary disease (pulmonary nodules, so called 
‘coin lesions’, infiltrates, cavitary lesions, pulmonary haemorrhage, and rarely bronchial stenosis), 
ear/nose/throat involvement (pain, stuffed nose, nosebleeds, crusting, saddle-nose deformity, hearing 
loss due to auditory tube dysfunction, sensoneural hearing loss, strawberry gingivitis, non-specific 
ulcerations of the oral mucosa, subglottal stenosis), constitutional symptoms, fever, arthralgias, 
purpura and neurologic disease. Upper and lower airway disease is the most common presenting 
feature of GPA, occurring in 70% to 90% of patients, renal disease is present in approximately 80% of 
patients. 
The approved therapeutic indication “Tavneos, in combination with a rituximab or cyclophosphamide 
regimen, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with severe, active granulomatosis with 
polyangiitis (GPA) or microscopic polyangiitis (MPA)’’  falls within the scope of the two designated 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
Page 7/12 
 
 
 
 
 
orphan conditions “Treatment of granulomatosis with polyangiitis” and ‘‘Treatment of microscopic 
polyangiitis’’. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP on the 
basis of the submitted evidence including data from the randomised, double-blind, multicentre, pivotal 
phase 3 ADVOCATE study. For a full discussion of the results, please refer to the European Public 
Assessment Report of Tavneos. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
No change in the chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature of the conditions have been 
reported since the designation of the orphan medicinal product.   
The condition is chronically debilitating due to progressive affection of the respiratory tract and kidneys 
and life-threatening due to the risk of renal- and respiratory failure, as well as infections and 
malignancies, also as a consequence of available treatments. Patients with MPA have a 1-year 
mortality rate up to 23% (corral-Gudino et al, 2011). Patients with GPA have a 9-fold increased 
mortality risk in the first year of disease, compared to healthy controls. Main causes of death are 
infections, pulmonary complications, and renal disease. Cardiovascular disease is also common. Other 
adverse effects of long-term glucocorticoid therapy are osteoporosis, diabetes, hypertension, and 
ocular cataract. Cyclophosphamides increase the risk for bladder cancer, acute myeloid leukaemia, and 
non-melanoma skin cancer, and impact fertility.  Around 40% of all patients develop end-stage renal 
disease requiring renal replacement therapy within 2 years after diagnosis (Jayne et al 2000). 
Number of people affected or at risk 
• 
Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) 
A PubMed literature search was conducted on 5-May-2021 with the following search terms to identify 
any new reports since the time of the application: “microscopic polyangiitis” OR “Wegener’s” OR 
“granulomatosis with polyangiitis” OR “ANCA-associated vasculitis”. Since the orphan drug application, 
no further relevant MPA publications were found.  
A prevalence of AAV of 69.3 per million was reported in Turkey for the period of 2004 to 2014;60% of 
these were GPA (41.6 per million),30% MPA (20.8 per million), and 10% eosinophilic granulomatosis 
with polyangiitis (EGPA; 6.9 per million; Pamuk et al, 2016). The incidence of AAV in this study was 
8.1 per million person-years; 4.8 for GPA, 2.4 for MPA, and 0.8 for EGPA. A study from Spain reported 
an annual incidence of AAV of 29 per million patient-years from 1994 through 2010; 10 for GPA, 16 for 
MPA, and 3 for EGPA (Romero-Gomez et al, 2015). This study also reported a prevalence of AAV of 
44.8 per million; 15.8 for GPA, 23.8 for MPA, and 5.3 for EGPA. Hoang et al reported the frequency of 
various types of vasculitis as summarised in Table 1 (Hoang 2020).  
Table 1. Incidence - Microscopic polyangiitis 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
Page 8/12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The sponsor concludes on a prevalence of the condition of 0.94 per 10,000 in the EU, which was 
accepted by the COMP as a conservative estimate. However, the COMP considered that the prevalence 
should be reported as ‘‘not more than 1 in 10,000’’. 
•  Granulomatosis with polyangitis (GPA) 
The sponsor has searched the PubMed database with the following search terms to identify any new 
reports since the time of the initial orphan application: “microscopic polyangiitis” OR “Wegener’s” OR“ 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis” OR “ANCA-associated vasculitis”. A study from Poland (Kanecki et al 
2018) used data from the Polish hospital morbidity study carried out by the National Institute of Public 
Health. This study examining the period 2011-2015 consisted of 1491 patients and estimated annual 
incidence at 7.7 per million population and prevalence at 0.36 per 10,000. This prevalence estimate 
was within the range found in the original orphan application in 2014 (0.24 to 1.57 per 10,000). 
Therefore, GPA remains an orphan disease with a prevalence ≤5 per 10,000 people.  
Hoang et al reported the frequency of various types of vasculitis as summarised in Table 2 (Hoang 
2020). 
Table 2. Incidence - Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis) 
The COMP agrees that the prevalence has not been changed since the orphan designation of the 
product in 2014 and remains 1.6 per 10,000. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
Treatment consists of two stages: an intensive induction treatment at the time of disease flare, 
followed by chronic maintenance therapy with milder immunosuppressive treatment regimens to 
prevent relapses and organ damage by chronic vasculitis.  
Rituximab (in combination with corticosteroids) is the only approved treatment for the condition by a 
centralised procedure in the EU. It was approved in 2013 for the induction treatment of patients with 
GPA and MPA, and since 2017, also for the maintenance of GPA and MPA. Cyclophosphamide is also 
authorised in several member states for the treatment of Wegener’s Disease, which is the same as 
GPA.  Because of its toxicity, it is used as induction therapy of acute flares, usually followed by 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
Page 9/12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
azathioprine maintenance therapy according to treatment guidelines recommendations (e.g. 
EULAR/ERA-EDTA 2016) 
The sponsor also states that in spite of not being authorised, corticosteroids, in combination according 
to the different phase of the condition are the mainstay treatments of antineutrophil cytoplasmic 
antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV). Methotrexate has been acknowledged as an alternative 
to cyclophosphamide in the induction phase for those patients with milder disease and normal renal 
function. 
In addition to the above mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is used in the treatment of the condition. 
Plasmapheresis has also been used in adult patients with severe progressive renal failure. 
Significant benefit 
The sponsor argues a clinically relevant advantage based on the outcome of the pivotal Phase 3 study 
(ADVOCATE) in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis, which showed that avacopan is an effective 
treatment in these patients. A total of 330 patients aged 13 years or older with GPA (54.8%) or MPA 
(45.2%) were treated in the active-comparator, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, 
multicentre, pivotal phase 3 ADVOCATE study for 52 weeks. 
Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two groups: 
•  Avacopan group (N=166): Patients received 30 mg avacopan twice daily for 52 weeks plus 
prednisone-matching placebo tapering regimen over 20 weeks, 
•  Comparator group (N=164): Patients received avacopan-matching placebo twice daily for 52 weeks 
plus prednisone (tapered from 60 mg/day to 0 over 20 weeks) 
Patients were stratified in two strata with different background treatments: rituximab IV induction 
(4W) therapy, followed by placebo between Week 13-52, or cyclophosphamide (12 W induction), 
followed by azathioprine (AZA) or MMF maintenance W13-52). About 70% of the study population 
received rituximab in the induction phase, as at the time of recruitment, Mabthera (rituximab) was not 
yet approved for maintenance therapy in GPA/MPA. 
The following arguments are considered supportive for the significant benefit:  
1. Superior efficacy in sustained remission at Week 52, and a lower relapse rate in the avacopan group 
compared to prednisone:  
•  Sustained remission at Week 52 was achieved in 90 of 164 subjects (54.9%) in the prednisone 
control group and 109 of 166 subjects (65.7%) in the avacopan group (P=0.0066 for superiority). 
•  A higher incidence of sustained remission at week 52 in the avacopan group compared to the 
prednisone group in the rituximab stratum, where subjects did not receive any protocol specified 
immunosuppressive treatment during the last 26 weeks. In the rituximab stratum, sustained 
remission at week 52 was achieved in 60 of 107 subjects (56.1%) in the prednisone group 
compared to 76 of 107 subjects (71.0%) in the avacopan group (P=0.0040 f or superiority). 
•  Avacopan was non-inferior to prednisone in achieving remission at week 26 on top of rituximab 
induction therapy or cyclophosphamide: Remission at week 26 was achieved in 115 of 164 subjects 
(70.1%) in the prednisone control group and 120 of 166 subjects (72.3%) in the avacopan group 
(P < 0.0001 for non-inferiority). 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
Page 10/12 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
The reduction in the incidence of relapse at any time after achievement of Birmingham vasculitis 
activity score (BVAS)=0 was statistically significant in the avacopan group compared to the 
prednisone group. 
2. The medical outcomes survey short form-36 version 2 (SF-36v2) total score numerically improved 
more in the avacopan group than in the comparator group during the pivotal phase 3 study.  
3. Renal function, a clinically relevant outcome was improved more in the avacopan group compared to 
the prednisone group.  At week 52, the least squares mean (LSM) increase from baseline in Estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (Egfr) was 7.3 mL/min/1.73 m² in the avacopan group (from a baseline of 
44.6 mL/min/1.73 m²) and 4.1 mL/min/1.73 m² in the comparator group (from a baseline of 45.6 
mL/min/1.73 m²) (LSM difference 3.2, [95% CI 0.3, 6.1]). 
4. Glucocorticoid toxicity was significantly reduced in the avacopan group compared to the prednisone 
group. The glucocorticoid toxicity index cumulative worsening score and the aggregate improvement 
score at weeks 13 and 26 were clinically and statistically lower in the avacopan group compared to the 
prednisone group, particularly regarding body mass index, glucose tolerance, lipids, steroid myopathy, 
skin toxicity, neuropsychiatric toxicity, and infection components.  
The significant benefit is also considered as demonstrated based on glucocorticoid saving properties of 
avacopan treatment on top of induction treatment. In addition, a benefit in renal outcomes was shown 
at longer term treatment as compared to standard of care azathioprine.  
The COMP assessed the results from the pivotal trial for the total study population (combined for GPA 
and MPA patients). No subgroup analyses for the separate conditions were taken into consideration, as 
the study population was not stratified a priori based on their diagnosis MPA/GPA, and the study was 
neither powered to demonstrate an effect for each condition separately, which would be challenging 
given the rarity of the conditions. Subgroup analyses would also be challenging given the complex 
study design with multiple treatment strata.  
Based on the above and taking into account the therapeutic indication which is covered by both orphan 
designated conditions “treatment of granulomatosis with polyangiitis” and ‘‘treatment of microscopic 
polyangiitis’’, the COMP considered that avacopan in combination with either rituximab or 
cyclophosphamide regimen was effective on top of standard of care in improving relevant clinical 
outcomes of MPA (and GPA), including parameters of renal function and overall vasculitis scores. The 
COMP concluded that the sponsor has provided sufficient arguments to justify that the product could 
be of significant benefit to patients affected by the condition(s). 
4.  COMP positions adopted on 12 November 2021 
EU/3/14/1372 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product. 
the prevalence of microscopic polyangiitis (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be not more than 1 in 10,000 
persons in the European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to the progressive affection of the respiratory tract and 
kidneys and life-threatening due to the risk of renal failure; 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

• 
although satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the assumption that Tavneos may be of potential significant benefit to those 
affected by the orphan condition still holds. The sponsor provided data from the pivotal clinical trial 
demonstrating that Tavneos was effective on top of standard of care in improving relevant clinical 
outcomes of microscopic polyangiitis, including parameters of renal function and a relevant 
reduction of glucocorticoid treatment. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Tavneos, (2R,3S)-2-(4-
cyclopentylaminophenyl)-1-(2-fluoro-6-methylbenzoyl)piperidine-3-carboxylic acid(4-methyl-3-
trifluoromethylphenyl)amide, avacopan for treatment of microscopic polyangiitis (EU/3/14/1372) is not

IMBRUVICA
Centralized procedure
Chemical class
Small-molecule inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK)
Summary of mode of action
Ibrutinib is a potent, small-molecule inhibitor of BTK and forms a 
stable covalent bond with a cysteine residue (Cys-481) in the BTK 
active site, leading to sustained inhibition of BTK enzymatic activity. 
BTK, a member of the Tec kinase family, is an important signaling 
molecule of the B-cell antigen receptor and cytokine receptor pathways. 
The B-cell antigen receptor pathway is implicated in the pathogenesis of 
several B-cell malignancies, including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma, and 
B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). BTK’s pivotal role in 
signaling through the B-cell surface receptors results in activation of 
pathways necessary for B-cell trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion. 
Ibrutinib effectively inhibits malignant B-cell proliferation and survival 
as well as cell migration and substrate adhesion.
In preclinical tumor models, the combination of ibrutinib and 
venetoclax resulted in increased cellular apoptosis and anti-tumor 
activity compared to either agent alone. BTK inhibition by ibrutinib 
increases CLL cell dependence on BCL-2, a cell survival pathway, 
while venetoclax inhibits BCL-2 leading to apoptosis.

Risk Management Plan Version 22.1
Module SI:  Epidemiology of the Indication(s) and Target Population(s)
Indication: Mantle Cell Lymphoma
Incidence:
Mantle cell lymphoma represents approximately 6% to 8% of all new non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma 
(NHL) cases per year (Rule, 2019). Estimates of the incidence of MCL in the total population are 
below 1 case per 100,000 persons throughout the world. The incidence of MCL in Europe has been 
estimated at 0.45 per 100,000 population and 0.71 per 100,000 population in the United States
(US) based on registry data from 2002 to 2007 (Botta et al, 2020). Other national databases have 
estimated  an  incidence  of  0.9 per  100,000 persons  for  the  years  2010 to  2016 in  the  United 
Kingdom  (UK)  (Hematological  Malignancy  Research  Network  [HMRN],  2019)  and  1.80 per 
100,000 persons in Finland for 2019 (Finnish Cancer Registry, 2021).
Prevalence:
MCL represents 7% to 9% of lymphomas in Europe (Vose, 2017) and 1.3% of all hematological 
malignancies  in  the  United  Kingdom  (HMRN,  2019).  Prevalence  in  Europe  is  estimated  to  be
about  3.5  per  100,000  population  (Orphanet, 2021).  The  10-year  prevalence  in  the  United 
Kingdom for 2007 to 2016 is estimated at 3.7 per 100,000 population (HMRN, 2019). A study by 
Sant  analyzed  16,955  NHL  cases  diagnosed  from 1990  to  1994  in  27  of  67 population-based 
cancer registries participating in European Cancer Registry (EUROCARE), and 22,713 NHL cases 
diagnosed  over  the  same  period  in  9 US  cancer  registries.  Of  the  4 NHL  groupings  (follicular 
lymphoma,  DLBCL,  MCL,  and  “other  NHL”  subtypes),  MCL  had  similar  frequencies  in 
EUROCARE overall and in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) (5.9% and 4.4% 
of total NHL cases), but a much higher frequency in Estonia (20.3%) likely due to incorrect coding 
conversions in diagnostic disease codes (Sant et al, 2008). The Committee for Orphan Medicinal 
Products at the European Medicines Agency (EMA) reported that the prevalence rate of MCL for 
the period from 2004 to 2015 was stable at approximately 0.5 in 10,000 (Polsinelli et al, 2017).
Demographics of the Population in the Authorized Indication - Sex, Age, Racial and/or Ethnic 
Origin, and Risk Factors for the Disease
Sex
MCL  is  more  than  twice  as  common  among  men  compared  with  women  both  in  Europe 
(male-to-female-ratio  2.3:1)  and 
ratio  2.65:1)
(Aschebrook-Kilfoy et  al,  2013).  In  the  United  Kingdom,  the  male-to-female  ratio  is  2.6:1 
(HMRN, 2019). Specifically, in the United States, the incidence rate of MCL in men was reported 
to  be  1.3 per  100,000 person-years for  2007  to  2016,  and  among  women,  the  rate  was  0.4 per
100,000 person-years (Howlader et al, 2019).

Age
Risk Management Plan Version 22.1
In the United Kingdom, the median age at diagnosis is 72.9 years (HMRN, 2019). In the United 
Kingdom, the  incidence  increases  with  age  going  from  0.52 per  100,000  population  for  45- to
49-year-olds, with the highest rate being 4.69 per 100,000 population for 75- to 79-year-olds, and 
4.02 per 100,000 population for those aged 80 and older (HMRN, 2019).
In the United States, from 2007 to 2016, the overall incidence rate per 100,000 person-years was 
0.4 in 20- to 64-year-olds and 4.4 in those aged 65 and older (Howlader et al, 2019).
Race/Ethnicity
MCL  incidence  does  not  show  an  association  with  ethnicity  in  the  United  Kingdom 
(Cancer Research UK, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Incidence Statistics, 2016). In the United States,
for the years 2004 to 2013, 82.7% of MCL patients were white non-Hispanic, 3.9% were black, 
6.0% were Hispanic, and 7.3% were other populations (Shah et al, 2019). There is evidence that 
the incidence of MCL in Asian countries is lower than in western countries (Jain and Wang, 2019).
Risk Factors for the Disease

Risk factors for MCL include being above the age of 60 years and being male. There is also a

relatives appears  at a  younger age than in the parents, thus  suggesting  a  genetic predisposition

It has also been suggested that people exposed to causative agents for an extended period of time, 
such as pesticides, organophosphate insecticides, and phenoxy herbicides, have a greater risk of 
developing MCL (Cortelazzo et al, 2012).
Main Existing Treatment Options:
Most  patients  with  MCL  receive  treatment  following  diagnosis  and  staging.  For  younger,  fit 
patients with MCL, the therapeutic strategy has been to use aggressive induction chemotherapy 
followed by autologous stem cell transplantation. For older patients who cannot tolerate intensive 
chemotherapy  or  autologous  stem  cell  transplantation,  historically,  R-CHOP (rituximab, 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,  vincristine, and prednisone) chemotherapy  has  been used,  and 
other  chemotherapy  options  include  VR-CAP  (a  combination  of  bortezomib,  rituximab, 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone) and BR (Chen et al, 2016).

IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib)
Risk Management Plan Version 22.1
The prognosis for patients with MCL who have progressed after first-line therapy is dismal. In the 
European Union (EU), temsirolimus and ibrutinib are approved for treating relapsed and refractory 
MCL (Dreyling  et  al,  2014).  Bortezomib  is  approved  in  combination  with  rituximab, 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone for the treatment of previously untreated MCL in 
patients  who  are  unsuitable  for  hematopoietic  stem  cell  transplantation  (SCT)  in  the  European 
Union (Dreyling et al, 2014). Lenalidomide is used for the treatment of relapsed MCL and has also 
been used in combination with rituximab (Vose, 2017).
Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the Untreated Population, Including 
Mortality and Morbidity:
MCL is an aggressive B-cell subtype of NHL which generally arises from naïve, pre–germinal 
center lymphocytes. MCL characteristically exhibits small-to-medium–sized tumor cells that can 
infiltrate the lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, blood, and gastrointestinal (GI) system. It has an 
aggressive disease  course  and a high  rate of  relapse.  Most  patients are initially diagnosed  with 
stage  III  or  IV  disease,  and are usually symptomatic at presentation. Common features include 
widespread  lymphadenopathy  and  splenomegaly,  and  bone  marrow  infiltration.  Leukemic 
involvement is found in 20% to 30% of patients. Extranodal involvement is common, and most 
frequently involves the GI tract and liver. More than 90% of patients have extranodal involvement 
at diagnosis, and between 30% and 50% of patients show infiltration in more than 2 extranodal 
areas. The clinical course of MCL is not uniform, as disease course usually corresponds with the 
particular subtype of the disease (Rosen et al, 2013). In approximately 10% to 20% of patients, the 
clinical course of MCL is smoldering nodal/extra-nodal or asymptomatic non-blastoid leukemic 
non-nodal.  These  are variants  that do  not  need  immediate  systemic  treatment  and  the 
watch-and-wait strategy is used (Jain and Wang, 2019). However, most cases follow a relatively 
rapid  disease  progression,  short  response  to  treatment,  inevitable  relapses,  and  continuously 
declining survival curve (Li et al, 2013).
Mortality and Morbidity
There is no curative therapy for MCL, with the rare exception of patients who achieve long-term, 
disease-free  survival  after  allogeneic  SCT  (Goy,  2011).  The  median  duration  of  remission 
according to most studies is 1.5 to 3 years and the median survival is 3 to 6 years with standard 
chemotherapy (Leukemia & Lymphoma Society MCL, 2018). In the United Kingdom, the 5-year 
relative survival has been estimated to be 41.9% (HMRN, 2019). Some patients succumb to their 
disease in less than 6 months, whereas others (8%) survive more than 10 years. The blastoid and 
pleomorphic variants appear more aggressive, with a median overall survival (OS) of 18 months. 
The  median  OS  of  patients  with  advanced  non-blastoid  or  pleomorphic  MCL  almost  doubled 
during the past 30 years from 2.7 years up to 4.8 years in recent studies. The superior outcome 
may be a result of the improvement of treatment regimens (Cortelazzo et al, 2012). Data suggest 
that survival also improved in Germany, with the 5-year relative survival for MCL increasing from 
51.6% in 2003 to 2007 to 58.5% in 2008 to 2012 (Pulte et al, 2017). One study reported a median 
OS of 70 months, a 5-year OS of 54.9% and 10-year OS of 33.5% (Chihara et al, 2019).

Important Comorbidities:
Risk Management Plan Version 22.1
Important comorbidities in patients with MCL include infections, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), 
renal insufficiencies (Schmidt et al, 2011), and other malignancies (Chihara et al, 2016).
Indication: Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
Incidence:
CLL, a B-cell lymphoid malignancy, is the most common leukemia among adults in the United 
States  and  Europe  with  annual  incidence  ranging  between  4  to 6 cases  per  100,000 persons 
(Scarfò et  al,  2016). In  the  United  Kingdom,  for  the  years  2010  to  2016, the  incidence  was 
estimated  at  7.2 per  100,000 population,  with  4,680 new  cases  in  2016 (HMRN,  2019),  and  in 
Finland the age-standardized incidence for 2019 was estimated to be 4.64 per 100,000 population
(Finnish Cancer Registry, 2021). Based on the Cancer Registry of Norway, the age-standardized 
incidence increased from 0.6 per 100,000 person-years in 1953 to 3.1 per 100,000 person-years in 
2012. There was a 68% increase in incidence between 1993 to 2002 (1,557 patients) and 2003 to 
2012 (2,636 patients) (Lenartova et al, 2016). For 2014 to 2018, the age-adjusted incidence of CLL 
in the United States was 4.9 per 100,000 population (SEER Explorer, 2021). A Canadian study 
conducted in the province of British Columbia observed a world age-standardized incidence rate 
of CLL to be 1.71 per 100,000 in that province (Mak et al, 2014). 
Approximately 5% to 8% of patients have a detectable deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17 
(del17p)  at  diagnosis (Stilgenbauer  and  Zenz, 2010).  The  del17p  results  in  the  deletion  of  one 
allele of TP53, the gene encoding for the important tumor suppressor p53 (Sellner et al, 2013). A
further 4% to 5% of patients have TP53 mutation without del17p at the time of diagnosis. The 
proportion of patients with del17p increases with successive chemotherapy treatments, so that in 
the relapsed setting up to 30% to 50% of patients have del17p (Badoux et al, 2011; Stilgenbauer 
and Zenz, 2010).
Prevalence:
In  Europe,
the  prevalence  of  CLL  has  been  estimated  to  be 48 per  100,000 population 
(Orphanet, 2021).  The  worldwide  prevalence  of  CLL  in  2016 was  460,000 (Global  Burden  of 
Disease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence Collaborators, 2017). In the United Kingdom, CLL 
accounts for 10.6% of all hematological malignancies (HMRN, 2019). In the United States, there 
were an estimated 195,129 (0.060%) people living with CLL in 2018 (SEER Explorer, 2021).
Demographics of the Population in the Authorized Indication - Sex, Age, Racial and/or Ethnic 
Origin, and Risk Factors for the Disease
Sex
Globally,  the  age-standardized  incidence  rate  per  100,000 person-years  for CLL  in  2015  was 
estimated  to  be  3.4  (3.2-3.7)  for  men  and  2.4  (2.2-2.6)  for  women (Global  Burden  of  Disease 
Cancer Collaboration,  2017). In Europe, the incidence rate of  CLL varies from 2.2 to 3.36 per 
100,000  population in  men  and  0.9 to  1.52 per  100,000  population in  women  (Panovska  et  al, 
2010). In the United Kingdom, the age-standardized incidence rate has been estimated to be 9.2 per 
100,000 population for men and 5.2 per 100,000 population for women (HMRN, 2019). For the

Nordic  countries  (Denmark,  Finland,  Greenland,  Iceland,  Norway,  and  Sweden),
the 
incidence  rate  was  3.6 per  100,000 population  for  men  and  1.8 per 
age-standardized 
100,000 population for women in 2016 (Nordcan, 2019). In the United States, the incidence rate
is 6.7 per 100,000 population for men and 3.5 per 100,000 population for women for 2014 to 2018
(SEER Explorer, 2021). 
Risk Management Plan Version 22.1
Age
This disorder is often considered to be a disease of the elderly: the median age of diagnosis in the 
European  Union  is  72 years  and  only  10%  of  patients  are  less  than  55  years  old 
(Eichhorst et al, 2021).  In the United Kingdom, the median age at diagnosis was 71.8 years for 
2010 to 2016 (HMRN, 2019). In the United States, in the years 2014 to 2018, the incidence rate 
was 0.4 per 100,000 for people under 50 years, 7.9 per 100,000 for those aged 50 to 64 years, and 
27.1  for  those  65 years  or older  (SEER  Explorer,  2021).  The  mean  age  at  diagnosis  has  been 
reported as 69.8 years (Blansky et al, 2020).
Race/Ethnicity
Race in the European CLL population is not described. In the United States, the incidence rate in 
2014 to 2018 was 6.0 per 100,000 population for non-Hispanic whites, 3.2 per 100,000 population 
for blacks, and 2.1 per 100,000 population for Hispanics (SEER Explorer, 2021). The incidence 
rate for the Asian population in the United States for the same time period was lower (1.6 and 
0.8 per  100,000  population  for  men  and  women,
respectively)  (SEER  Explorer,  2021). 
Specifically, a Canadian study conducted by combining data from British Columbia databases and 
Hong Kong Cancer Registry observed world age-standardized incidence rates of CLL per 100,000 
to be 0.28 in Hong Kong and 0.4 in Chinese living in British Columbia (Mak et al, 2014).
Risk Factors for the Disease
Factors that may increase the risk of CLL include older age, white race, a family history of the 
disease or of another form of blood and bone marrow cancers, and exposure to certain herbicides 
and  insecticides  including  Agent  Orange  used  during  the  Vietnam  War  (Mayo Clinic,  Chronic 
lymphocytic  leukaemia:  Symptoms  &  causes,  2019). Exposure  to  several  solvents,  including 
benzene, toluene, and xylene, has been found to increase the risk of CLL (Wang and Ma, 2014).
Main Existing Treatment Options:
Current treatments for CLL are not curative, are limited by inevitable relapse as well as by toxicity, 
and are complicated by eventual resistance to therapy. Fewer patients obtain responses with each 
subsequent  regimen,  and  subjects  become 
therapy 
(Hillmen,  2011;  Maddocks  and  Lin,  2009).  While  SCT  is  a  potentially  curative  therapy,  few 
patients are able to undergo this treatment (Gribben and O’Brien, 2011).

Treatment for CLL depends on the stage of the disease, the signs and symptoms, and the fitness of 
the  patient.  The  standard  treatment  of  patients  with  early  disease  is  a  watch-and-wait  strategy 
(Eichhorst et al, 2021). When treatment is indicated, several options exist for most CLL patients: 
a 
or 
chemoimmunotherapy. For physically fit patients younger than 65 years, chemoimmunotherapy 
with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab remains a standard therapy (Hallek, 2019).

In  more  advanced  stages, when  patients  develop  symptomatic  or  progressive  disease  per
International  Workshop  on  Chronic  Lymphocytic  Leukemia  (iwCLL)  criteria  for  treatment 
(Hallek et al, 2018), treatment agent options may include:
 Chemotherapy such as fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, bendamustine, or chlorambucil

Immunotherapy: rituximab, ofatumumab, obinutuzumab
 Targeted drug therapy: ibrutinib, idelalisib, venetoclax
 SCT
Most often, chemotherapy is combined with immunotherapy, eg, fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, 
rituximab (FCR), BR, and chlorambucil in combination with obinutuzumab are commonly used 
regimens. Novel targeted agents may be given with or without immunotherapy.
Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the Untreated Population, Including 
Mortality and Morbidity:
CLL is a lymphoproliferative disorder, involving peripheral blood, bone marrow, and lymphoid 
organs  (Scarfò et  al,  2016).  The  clinical  manifestations  of  CLL  range  from  an  asymptomatic 
patient with  minimal B-cell lymphocytosis  to a progressive clinical picture of  enlarging lymph 
nodes, splenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and life-threatening infections (Kempin, 2013). 
Some patients live with stable disease for many years  without intervention, while 20% to 30% 
follow  an  aggressive  course,  sometimes  with  rapid  progression  requiring 
treatment 
(Huang et al, 2014). Advanced stage patients can show fatigue and intolerance to physical exercise 
due  to  anemia,  secondary  to  bone  marrow  infiltration,  while  the  presence  of  bleeding 
manifestations due to low platelet count is very rare. The nonspecific ‘B’ symptoms, which include 
fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue, and/or malaise, are indicators of increased disease 
activity  and  need  for  treatment.  Other  symptoms  indicating  the  need  for  treatment  are  anemia, 
thrombocytopenia, and progressive lymphadenopathy (Tees and Flinn, 2017). Patients with CLL 
have  a  higher  vulnerability  to  infections,  with  bacterial  infections  involving  upper  and  lower 
respiratory  tract  and  urinary  tract  being  the  most  frequent,  though  an  increased  risk  of  viral 
reactivation (eg, herpes zoster infection) has also been reported (Scarfò et al, 2016). About 5% to 
10% of patients with CLL develop "Richter's transformation" which refers to the development of 
aggressive lymphoma with rapidly enlarging lymph nodes (Jain and O’Brien, 2012). Advanced 
disease  is  frequently  characterized  by  worsening  infectious  complications  which  represent  the 
main cause of death (Scarfò et al, 2016).

Mortality and Morbidity
Risk Management Plan Version 22.1
For CLL, the 5-year relative survival in Europe was estimated to be 70.4%, was better in women 
than men (73.7% versus 68%), and ranged from 58% in Eastern Europe to about 74% in Central 
and  Northern  Europe  (De  Angelis  et  al,  2015).  In  the  United  States, the  5-year  survival  was 
estimated at 87.2% for 2011 to 2017 (SEER Explorer, 2021). CLL has 3 stages. When diagnosed 
in the earlier stage, people generally live for 10 years or more. For those diagnosed in the most 
advanced stage, people usually live for approximately 6.5 years. For all others, people generally 
live more than 8 years (Cancer Research UK, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia, 2018).
The  mortality rate  was  1.1 per  100,000  population  for  2014 to  2018 in  the  United  States 
(SEER Explorer, 2021). Of the CLL deaths, mortality for patients under the age of 50 was 0.0 per 
100,000 population, 0.6 per 100,000 population for those aged 50 to 64 years, and 8.2 per 100,000 
population for those 65 years or older. During this same period, the mortality was 1.6 per 100,000 
population for men and 0.8 per 100,000 population for women (SEER Explorer, 2021). The death 
rates by race between 2014 and 2018 in the United States are detailed in the table below (SEER
Explorer, 2021).

and renal insufficiencies (Schmidt et al, 2011).
Indication: Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia
Incidence:
WM accounts for 1% to 2% of hematological neoplasms (Steingrímsson et al, 2017). In Europe,
the incidence is estimated to be 0.81 per 100,000 population (Orphanet, 2021). Another study of 
patients with WM recorded within the South Thames Hematology Registry from 1999 to 2001 in 
the United Kingdom, estimated the age-standardized annual incidence of WM at 5.5 per million 
persons  per  year  (Phekoo  et  al,  2008).  In  Sweden, 
incidence  of 
WM/lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) was estimated to be 11.5 per million persons per year 
for the years 2000 to 2014 (Brandefors et al, 2018). In the United States, the incidence was 0.48 per 
100,000 population for 1980 to 2016 (Yin et al, 2020).

Prevalence:
Risk Management Plan Version 22.1
WM is a subtype of LPL, which is a rare type of NHL. In the World Health Organization’s (WHO) 
classification  of  neoplasms  of  the  hematopoietic  and  lymphoid  tissues  (Hossfeld,  2002),  LPL 
includes patients with WM, in whom the malignant cells produce immunoglobulin (Ig)M protein. 
A Swedish study reported that 86.1% of LPL patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2014 met the 
criteria for WM (Brandefors et al, 2018).
Demographics of the Population in the Authorized Indication - Sex, Age, Racial and/or Ethnic 
Origin, and Risk Factors for the Disease
Sex
WM is found at a higher proportion in men than women. For example, in a Swedish population-
based  study  of  1,555  LPL/WM  patients,  men constituted  57.9%  of 
these  patients 
(Kristinsson et al, 2013). A UK registry-based study reported the age-standardized incidence rates 
of  WM  to  be 0.73  and  0.42  per  100,000  European  standard  population  in  men and  women, 
respectively (Phekoo et al, 2008). Similarly, in the United States, the incidence rate in men was 
0.6 per 100,000 population and 0.3 per 100,000 population in women for the 2007 to 2016 period 
(Howlader et  al,  2019). Consistent  findings  were  also  seen  in  the  EUROCARE-based  project, 
HAEMACARE study, where the crude incidence rate of immunoproliferative disease (inclusive 
of LPL, WM, and not otherwise specified immunoproliferative disease and heavy chain disease) 
was 1.00 and 0.67 per 100,000 in men and women, respectively (Sant et al, 2010).
Age
WM is a disease of the elderly, with incidence increasing with age. In a population-based study in 
Sweden that included 1,555 LPL/WM patients diagnosed from 1980 to 2005, the overall median 
age of diagnosis was 72 years (Kristinsson et al, 2013). Similarly, 1 study in patients with WM 
recorded  within  the  South  Thames  Hematology  Registry  from  1999  to  2001  in  the  United 
Kingdom, observed a median age at diagnosis of 75 years (range 45-93 years) (Phekoo et al, 2008). 
In the United States, based on 20-year SEER data (2007 to 2016), the overall annual age-adjusted 
incidence of WM ranged from 0.2 per 100,000 person-years in patients aged 20 to 64 years to 2.4
per 100,000 person-years in patients aged 65 years or older (Howlader et al, 2019). 
Race/Ethnicity
WM  occurs  predominantly  in  the  white  population compared  with  the  black  population
representing  only  5%  of  all  patients.  Approximately  20%  of  WM  patients  have  an  Ashkenazi 
(Eastern European) Jewish ethnic background (Treon et al, 2008). In the United States, based on 
20-year SEER data (1988 to 2007), WM incidence rates were higher in the white population (4.1) 
than in the black population (1.8) or other races (2.1) per million persons (Wang et al, 2012). In 
the United States, based on SEER data from 2012 to 2017, the 5-year relative survival was 0.87 
(95% CI: 0.84-0.90) for the white population, 0.82 (95% CI: 0.75-0.90) for the black population, 
and  0.80  (95%  CI:  0.74-0.88)  for  the  Asian/Pacific  Islander  population.  The  10-year  relative 
survival  from  2000 to  2017  for  these  same  populations  was  0.70 (95%  CI:  0.67-0.73),  0.62 
(95% CI: 0.52-0.75), and 0.59 (95% CI: 0.50-0.69), respectively (Vaughn et al, 2021).

Risk Factors for the Disease
Risk Management Plan Version 22.1
WM is a rare cancer and mostly affects the elderly, aged over 65 years. The main risk factor is the 
presence of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and some studies 
have  shown  an  increased  risk  of  WM  with  the  presence  of  autoimmune  disorders  or  infection 
history (Simon et al, 2018). The potential role of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the etiology 
of WM is inconclusive. A high frequency of MYD88 L265P mutation has been observed in WM 
patients in multiple studies  (Poulain  et  al, 2013;  Treon et al, 2012).  The  disease has  a  familial 
component. Around 20% to 25% of patients with WM have been observed to have a relative with 
either WM or a similar condition such as CLL or another NHL (Lymphoma Action, 2019; Treon 
et al, 2006). A Swedish study found that first-degree relatives of LPL/WM patients have a 20-fold 
(95%  CI:  4.1-98.4)  increased  risk  of  developing  the  disease  compared  with  controls 
(Kristinsson et al, 2008). Another important risk factor for the development of WM is pre-existing 
IgM  monoclononal  gammopathy  of  undetermined  significance,  which  confers  a  46-fold  higher 
relative risk of developing WM compared with the general population. In addition, there may be a 
potential role for immune-related factors in the pathogenesis of WM (Ghobrial, 2012).
Main Existing Treatment Options:
WM  is  not  curable,  but  is  a  slow  growing  cancer.  Asymptomatic  patients  can  be  kept  under 
observation without therapy. Choice of therapy is highly personalized, dictated by symptoms, age, 
and  comorbidities  (Benevolo  et  al,  2017). Current  European  Society  for  Medical  Oncology 
(ESMO) and  National  Comprehensive  Cancer  Network  (NCCN) guidelines  recommend 
bortezomib/dexamethasone/rituximab  (BDR),  BR,  dexamethasone/rituximab/cyclophosphamide 
(DRC), bortezomib/rituximab (VR), or ibrutinib, depending on symptoms (Kastritis et al, 2018; 
NCCN,  2018).  Other  possible  agents  can  include  cladribine,  carfilzomib,  and  fludarabine 
(NCCN, 2018). SCT is sometimes considered for salvage therapy mainly in younger patients with 
WM (Kastritis et al, 2018). Plasmapheresis is used to manage hyperviscosity or for IgM-related 
complications (Kastritis et al, 2018). 
Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the Untreated Population, Including 
Mortality and Morbidity:
WM is defined as a B-cell LPL. WM is an indolent, chronic disease in most patients. The median 
survival varied in studies, from 5 years to nearly 11 years (Oza and Rajkumar, 2015). A German 
study reported 3-year progression-free survival from the start of first-line treatment to be 83% and 
3-year OS to be 87% (Knauf et al, 2020). At least 25% of patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis, 
and 50% of asymptomatic patients who are observed will not require therapy within 3 years and 
one in 10 will not require therapy for 10 years (Morel and Merlini, 2012). Most patients present 
with  symptoms  attributable  to  tumor  burden,  including  anemia,  pancytopenia,  organomegaly, 
neuropathy,  amyloidosis,  cryoglobulinemia,  night  sweats  and  symptomatic  hyperviscosity 
(Oza and Rajkumar, 2015). Approximately 20% of patients will experience hepatosplenomegaly 
and lymphadenopathy, and some patients may present with ‘B’ symptoms, including night sweats, 
fever, and weight  loss  (Ghobrial,  2012).  Median life expectancy  at diagnosis  is  between 5  and 
10 years,  but  varies  considerably  according  to  disease  aggressiveness  and  tumor  mass 
(Souchet-Compain et  al, 2014). The main  causes of  death of  WM  include disease  progression, 
transformation to high-grade lymphoma or complications of therapy (Oza and Rajkumar, 2015).

Mortality and Morbidity
A  retrospective  study  of  587  symptomatic  WM  patients  conducted  by  7  cooperative  groups  or 
institutions in Europe and the United States reported that the 5-year survival rate for patients with 
symptomatic WM is 87% for those with low-risk disease, 68% for those with intermediate-risk 
disease, and 36% for those with high-risk disease (Kasi et al, 2015; Morel et al, 2009).

5-year OS for WM to be 83.4%, 92.5% for patients 20 to 64 years, and 78.2% for those 65 years 
or older (Howlader et al, 2019).

PART II:  SAFETY SPECIFICATION
Module SII:  Nonclinical Part of the Safety Specification
Relevance to Human Usage
The margins for single-dose studies are high; 
therefore, there is minimal risk of acute toxicities 
in humans.  
In general, the toxicity of ibrutinib was similar 
across species and was related to the 
pharmacological activity of ibrutinib. Overall, 
based on animal studies the most likely human 
findings are GI events and pharmacologically 
mediated changes in the lymphoid organs.
Based on findings in animals, ibrutinib is 
teratogenic and may cause fetal harm when 
administered to pregnant women.
Key Safety Findings
Toxicity
Single-dose toxicity 
Single-dose studies were conducted in mice and 
rats. The maximum nonlethal total dose of 
ibrutinib following administration by oral gavage 
was 2,000 mg/kg for mice (human equivalent 
dose [HED]=160 mg/kg), 400 mg/kg for female 
rats (HED=64 mg/kg), and 1,000 mg/kg for male 
rats (HED=160 mg/kg). In rats, mortality with 
orally administered ibrutinib was 10% at a dose of 
1,000 mg/kg and 30% at 2,000 mg/kg.
Multiple dose toxicities
Multiple dose studies with a duration of 6 months 
in rats and 9 months in dogs were conducted. The 
no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was 
determined to be 100/50 mg/kg/day for 
male/female rats and 80 mg/kg/day for dogs in 
both genders. This corresponds to HEDs of 
16/8 mg/kg/day for male/female rat and 
43 mg/kg/day in dog, respectively.
Reproductive and developmental toxicity
The potential effects of ibrutinib on embryofetal 
development were evaluated in pregnant rats and 
rabbits. Rats were administered oral doses of 10, 
40, and 80 mg/kg on gestation Days 6 through 
17 (the period of organogenesis) and were 
euthanized on gestation Day 20 for assessment of 
implantation and litter parameters. The fetuses 
were examined for external, visceral, and skeletal 
malformations. There were no remarkable 
treatment-related maternal effects; therefore, the 
NOAEL for maternal toxicity was set at 
80 mg/kg/day (HED=12.8 mg/kg/day). Based on 
a higher mean litter proportion of 
post-implantation loss and a corresponding lower 
mean number of viable fetuses and test article-
related effects on fetal morphology (visceral 
[heart and major vessels] malformations and 
skeletal variations) at the 80 mg/kg/day dose 
level, as well as lower mean fetal body weights at 
the 40 and 80 mg/kg/day dose levels, 
10 mg/kg/day was considered to be the NOAEL 
for effects on embryofetal development 
(HED=1.6 mg/kg/day).

Key Safety Findings
Relevance to Human Usage
Rabbits were dosed with 5, 15, or 45 mg/kg/day 
on gestation Days 6 to 19; rabbits were euthanized 
on Day 28 of pregnancy and examined for 
macroscopic abnormalities, pregnancy status, 
corpora lutea, implantations, early and late 
resorptions, and live and dead fetuses. The fetuses 
were weighed, sexed, and examined for external, 
visceral, and skeletal abnormalities. Ibrutinib 
dosed at 45 mg/kg/day in rabbits was associated 
with increased post-implantation loss; when dosed 
at ≥15 mg/kg/day, fetal malformations (fused 
sternebrae) were induced. The NOAEL for effects 
on rabbit embryo/fetal development was 
5 mg/kg/day. Relative to a human dose of 
560 mg/day, the area under the curve (AUC)-
based safety margin was 0.75-fold. The NOAEL 
for rabbit maternal toxicity was 15 mg/kg/day 
(HED=4.8 mg/kg/day).
In repeated-dose studies in rats and dogs, no 
morphological changes were identified in the 
male and female reproductive organs.
Fertility and early embryonic development
The potential effects of ibrutinib on fertility and 
reproductive capacity, including conception and 
implantation were evaluated in male and female 
rats (22/group). Male rats received ibrutinib 
(lot 131439) at oral doses of 0 (vehicle; 0.5% w/v 
methylcellulose and 0.1% w/v sodium lauryl 
sulfate), 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg/day once daily for 
4 weeks prior to pairing, during pairing, and 
continuing until study termination. Female rats 
were administered the same dose levels once daily 
for 14 days prior to pairing, during pairing, and 
continuing until Day 7 of pregnancy [Day 0 of 
pregnancy = day of copulation]. Estrous cycles 
were recorded and the pre-coital interval was 
noted. The females were sacrificed on Day 14 of 
pregnancy for evaluation of pregnancy status. The 
males were sacrificed once the fertility rate in 
females had been established and sperm 
evaluation was conducted.
The NOAEL for fertility and reproductive 
capacities of adult female and male rats was 
considered to be 100 mg/kg/day 
(HED=16 mg/kg/day).
Based on the preclinical findings, no fertility and 
reproductive findings were identified.

Key Safety Findings
Genotoxicity
Ibrutinib was not genotoxic in studies evaluating 
reverse gene mutations in bacteria and erythrocyte 
micronuclei in the bone marrow of mice. Clinical 
grade ibrutinib did not induce chromosome 
aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells.
Major human metabolites M25 and M37 were not 
mutagenic in studies evaluating the ability to 
induce reverse gene mutations in bacteria with an 
added rat S9 metabolic activation system. Major 
metabolites M21 and M34 were not mutagenic in 
studies evaluating the ability to induce reverse 
gene mutations in bacteria with an added rat S9 
metabolic activation system and the sulfate 
conjugation cofactor adenosine 3’-phosphate-
5’-phosphosulfate present. M21, M25, M34, and 
M37 were considered negative for clastogenicity 
or disruption of mitotic spindle apparatus in a 
study evaluating micronucleated erythrocytes in 
the bone marrow of mice.
Carcinogenicity
Ibrutinib was not carcinogenic in a 6-month study 
in the transgenic (Tg.rasH2) mouse at oral doses 
up to 2,000 mg/kg/day with an exposure margin 
of approximately 23 (males) to 37 (females) times 
the human AUC of ibrutinib at a dose of 560 
mg/day.
Safety pharmacology
Cardiovascular system (including potential for 
QT interval prolongation)
The effects of ibrutinib and metabolite PCI-45227 
on human Ether-à-go-go-Related Gene (hERG) 
channel-mediated ion current were evaluated in 
voltage-clamped HEK293 cells that stably express 
hERG potassium channels. The half maximal 
inhibitory concentration (IC50) for inhibitory 
effect of ibrutinib on hERG channel current was 
970 nM (427 ng/mL). The IC50 for inhibitory 
effect of metabolite PCI-45227 on hERG channel 
current was 9,600 nM (4,555 ng/mL).
Risk Management Plan Version 22.1
Relevance to Human Usage
Based on the preclinical findings, no genotoxic 
risk was identified. No mutagenic or clastogenic
risk was identified for M21, M25, M34, or M37. 
Based on the preclinical findings, no carcinogenic 
risk was identified.
The IC50 for inhibitory effect of ibrutinib on 
hERG channel current (970 nM or 427 ng/mL) is 
96 times the average maximum steady-state 
plasma concentration of unbound ibrutinib 
(4.43 ng/mL) in patients receiving a dose of 
560 mg/day. The IC50 for inhibitory effect of 
metabolite PCI-45227 on hERG channel current 
(9,600 nM or 4,555 ng/mL) is 415 times the 
average maximum steady-state plasma 
concentration of unbound PCI-45227

Based on these margins of safety, neither ibrutinib 
nor metabolite PCI-45227 is expected to 
adversely affect ventricular repolarization in 
humans.

Key Safety Findings
Relevance to Human Usage
Human cardiac ion channels interrogated using 
the whole-cell voltage clamp technique indicated 
ibrutinib inhibits hERG-mediated IKr (Kv11.1) by 
19% at 1 µM and by 36.6% at 3 µM, inhibits late 
and peak INa (Nav1.5) only at 3 µM (by 35.8% 
and 27.5%, respectively), and inhibits IKur (Kv1.5) 
by 15.5% only at 3 µM. Ibrutinib up to 3 µM had 
no relevant effects on IKs (KvLQT1/minK), 
ICaL (Cav1.2), ICaT (Cav3.2), IK1 (Kir2.1), 
Ito (Kv4.3/KChiP2.2), If (HCN4), 
IKAch (Kir3.1/Kir3.4), and IKATP (Kir6.2/SUR2A).
Ibrutinib’s marginal inhibition of IKr (hERG) at 
1 and 3 µM and of INa (Nav1.5) and IKur (an atrial 
specific channel) at 3 µM occurs at concentrations 
that are over 100 times therapeutic free maximum 
concentration (Cmax) in human and is considered 
unlikely to be the basis for an enhanced 
susceptibility to atrial fibrillation within the 
therapeutic exposure range.
Ibrutinib was also evaluated in synchronously 
beating human induced pluripotent stem cell-
derived cardiomyocytes at concentrations of 0.03, 
0.1, 0.3, 1, and 3 µM nominal during 30 minutes
incubations. Up to 3 µM nominal there was no 
relevant effect on amplitude, beat rate, or CTD90
(a surrogate for QT-interval) and ibrutinib did not 
elicit arrhythmias, such as early after 
depolarization-like, ventricular tachycardia-like,
and ventricular fibrillation-like events. However, 
ibrutinib induced cessation of beating with an 
incidence of 50% at 1 and 3 µM nominal.
There were no findings in cardiomyocytes except 
for cessation of beating with an incidence of 50% 
at concentrations 1 and 3 µM that are over 
100 times higher than the therapeutic free Cmax in 
humans. The mechanism for the cessation of 
beating is unknown but may be a result of the 
weak Na+ channel inhibition identified with high 
concentration of ibrutinib. Similar findings have 
been noted with other weak Na+ channel blockers 
such as the positive control phenytoin, which is 
not known to be overtly pro-arrhythmic in clinical 
use.
The potential cardiovascular effects of orally 
administered ibrutinib were evaluated in 
telemetry-monitored male dogs. Prolongation of 
RR interval, lowered heart rate, and increased 
pulse pressure were noted at dose levels of 24 and 
150 mg/kg. In addition, prolonged PR intervals 
and shortened QT intervals, corrected according 
to Vandewater were noted at the 150 mg/kg dose 
level. There were no treatment-related effects on 
QTc (QT interval corrected for heart rate) 
intervals at any dose level. The no-observed-
effect level (NOEL) was determined to be 
1.5 mg/kg (HED=0.81 mg/kg). The changes 
observed in RR interval, heart rate, and pulse 
pressure at the 24-mg/kg dose level 
(HED=13 mg/kg) were considered to be non-
adverse because of the relatively small magnitude 
of maximum or overall change. Thus, 24 mg/kg 
was considered to be the NOAEL.
The estimated Cmax for ibrutinib at the NOAEL of 
24 mg/kg is approximately 6 times the mean Cmax
measured in patients receiving ibrutinib 
560 mg/day. No evidence of QT prolongation 
with increasing plasma concentrations of 
ibrutinib, as well as no evidence of QT 
prolongation with increasing concentrations of the 
metabolite PCI-45227 was observed in 2 of the 
completed clinical trials. 
Based on the nonclinical observations of 
prolonged PR intervals and lowered heart rates, 
and the available clinical data, the risk of cardiac 
arrhythmia (excluding atrial fibrillation and 
ventricular tachyarrhythmias) is considered an 
important potential risk with the use of ibrutinib. 
Atrial fibrillation and ventricular 
tachyarrhythmias have been included as important 
identified risks based on Phase 3 clinical data 
although these were not observed in nonclinical 
data.

Key Safety Findings
Nervous system
No treatment-related changes were noted in 
studies to evaluate potential effects of orally 
administered ibrutinib on the neurological 
function of rats. The NOEL for neurological in 
rats was set at 150 mg/kg (HED=24 mg/kg), the 
highest dose administered.
Respiratory function
No treatment-related changes were noted in 
studies to evaluate potential effects of orally 
administered ibrutinib on the respiratory function 
of rats. The NOEL for respiratory in rats was set 
at 150 mg/kg (HED=24 mg/kg), the highest dose 
administered.
Other toxicity-related information or data
Lymphoid organs
Lymphoid depletion of the spleen occurred in 
high-dose group male and female rats that 
received ibrutinib for 4 weeks. In rats dosed for 
13 weeks, minimal to severe lymphoid depletion 
of the mantle zone of the spleen and minimal to 
moderate lymphoid depletion of the cortex of the 
lymph nodes (axillary, mandibular, and/or 
mesenteric) were noted. Depletion of the 
lymphocytes in the mantle zone of the spleen 
correlated to the lower absolute B cells observed 
in the toxicokinetic group animals. Lymphoid 
depletion of Peyer’s patches was evident in the 
small and/or large intestines in dogs that received 
doses of 60 to 220 mg/kg/day in the 13-week 
toxicity study. The changes were minimal to mild 
and characterized by reduced size of the germinal 
center and mantle zones of the Peyer’s patches. 
Lymphoid findings were completely reversible 
following a 6-week recovery period.
Risk Management Plan Version 22.1
Relevance to Human Usage
In the rat neurological functional assay, there 
were no relevant observations at plasma 
exposures that were 18-fold higher than the 
plasma exposure measured in humans at the Cmax
after administration of the highest clinical dose of 
560 mg. Therefore, the risks for adverse 
neurological effects associated with the use of 
ibrutinib are negligible.
In the rat respiratory function assay, there were no 
relevant observations at plasma exposures that 
were 18-fold higher than the plasma exposure 
measured in humans at the Cmax after 
administration of the highest clinical dose of 
560 mg. Therefore, the risks for adverse 
respiratory effects associated with the use of 
ibrutinib are negligible.
Effects on lymphoid organs, particularly B
lymphocytes as observed in animal studies, are 
consistent with the pharmacological effects of 
BTK inhibition, and therefore, are relevant to 
humans but do not indicate a specific 
unanticipated safety risk. 
At high dose levels, where other adverse effects 
were present the lymphoid depletion was more 
generalized and consistent with a cortisol-
mediated stress response. Because of the margin 
where these findings occur the risk to humans is 
considered low.

The mechanism of the pancreatic changes in rats 
is unknown; however, the finding showed partial 
reversibility over a 6-week recovery period, was 
not associated with any clinically relevant 
biochemical markers, and was seen in only one 
species. There have been no relevant safety 
signals attributable to effects of ibrutinib on the 
pancreas in patient trials. The risk to humans is 
considered low.
Both rats and dogs had abnormal excreta with 
reversible lesions attributable to GI inflammation 
and with correlating reversible decreases in serum 
protein levels. Abnormal excreta (eg, diarrhea) are 
also a common adverse effect in clinical trials. 
Most of the events observed from human clinical 
trials were grade 1 or 2. 
GI adverse events (AEs) are common in patients 
but are generally mild, reversible, and manageable 
by routine standard of care. 
IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib)
Key Safety Findings
Exocrine pancreas
In rats dosed for 2 or 13 weeks, minimal to 
moderate acinar atrophy was observed in the 
pancreas of males and females. Acinar atrophy 
included a combination of fibrosis, brown 
pigment (interpreted as hemosiderin), small acini 
with fewer zymogen granules, and mixed 
inflammatory cell infiltrate (predominantly 
neutrophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells, 
consistent with a chronic inflammatory infiltrate). 
These lesions were noted at doses ranging from 
12 to 300 mg/kg/day and considered adverse 
(moderate severity or greater) at doses from 36 to 
300 mg/kg/day (HED=5.8 to 48 mg/kg/day). 
Atrophy of pancreatic acinar cells was more 
prominent in male rats and showed partial 
recovery in the 13-week study 6 weeks after the 
cessation of dosing. In the 2-week study in rats, 
where serum amylase and lipase levels were 
assessed, no correlative changes in these 
biochemical markers were observed. No 
pancreatic changes were observed in the dog 
studies.
Gastrointestinal system
Mild squamous epithelial hyperplasia was present 
in the non-glandular stomach of male rats 
administered ibrutinib for 4 weeks at 
300 mg/kg/day. Minimal to moderate edema and 
squamous epithelial atrophy were noted for the 
non-glandular stomach of female rats dosed at 
175 mg/kg/day for 13 weeks. Because neither of 
these findings was seen in both genders or in 
more than one study, their toxicological relevance 
is uncertain. Effects on the intestinal tract of rats 
dosed at 175 or 300 mg/kg/day for 13 weeks 
included minimal to mild acute inflammation in 
the cecum, colon, and/or rectum. Clinically, these 
animals had soft feces and presented with brown 
material on the anogenital areas during the course 
of the treatment period. Notable GI findings were 
not seen in rats administered ibrutinib for 6 
months at dose levels up to 100 mg/kg/day in 
males and 80 mg/kg/day in females.

Key Safety Findings
Relevance to Human Usage
In dogs dosed for 4 weeks, minimal to mild 
inflammation of the intestinal mucosa of dogs was 
observed microscopically in 2 of 3 males and 1 of
3 females at the 150 mg/kg/day dose level. These 
changes correlated with soft feces and diarrhea 
noted clinically and with higher neutrophil, 
monocyte, and/or eosinophil counts noted in the 
peripheral blood of affected dogs. In the 13-week 
toxicity study in dogs, a male dosed at 
220 mg/kg/day was euthanized in extremis on 
study Day 31 with acute inflammation of the 
intestines as well as ulceration of the duodenum 
and erosions of the stomach epithelium. Minimal 
to mild muscle degeneration was noted in the 
stomach of the 220/120 mg/kg/day group females 
on the 13-week study. Clinically, dogs in the 
80/60 and 220/120 mg/kg/day dose groups on the 
13-week study had abnormal excreta (soft feces, 
mucoid feces, diarrhea and/or diarrhea containing 
red material) throughout the dosing period. Dogs 
dosed up to 80 mg/kg/day for 9 months had no 
significant GI findings.
The clinical and histopathologic changes in the GI 
tract of rats and dogs were completely reversible.
Bone
In the 13-week toxicity study in rats, bone 
changes were characterized by minimal to mild 
thinning of cortical bone with fewer primary 
trabeculae. These lesions were observed primarily 
in the sternum and femur of the females dosed at 
100 and 175 mg/kg/day (HED=16 and 28 
mg/kg/day) only in the 13-week study. Notable 
bone findings were not seen in rats dosed up to 
100/80 mg/kg/day (males/females) for 6 months. 
Histopathologic changes in the bone resolved 
after the 6-week non-dosing recovery period. No 
morphological changes of the bones were seen in 
the dog studies.
The mechanism of the bone changes in rats is 
unknown; however, the finding was minimal to 
mild in nature, was reversible, and seen at >5-fold 
AUC exposures. Therefore, the risk to humans is 
low.

Serial ophthalmic examinations in completed 
clinical trials have revealed no clinical correlate to 
this finding.

Key Safety Findings
Cornea
Slight to moderate corneal dystrophy/opacity was 
noted during ophthalmic examinations for 3 of 
10 high-dose group dogs (150 mg/kg/day) in the 
4-week study and for 1 high-dose group dog 
(220/120 mg/kg/day) in the subsequent 13-week 
study. The corneal changes were noted both 
during the treatment periods and during the non-
dosing recovery periods. Corneal lesions were not 
seen in dogs dosed up to 80 mg/kg/day for 
9 months.
Hepatotoxicity
Based on in vitro data, ibrutinib is not transported 
by major transporter proteins involved in hepatic 
uptake or hepatic efflux.
Hepatic accumulation of ibrutinib due to hepatic 
transporter inhibition by coadministered drugs is 
not expected.
Based on in vitro data, a clinically relevant 
systemic inhibition of major transporter proteins 
by ibrutinib or its major human metabolites tested 
can be excluded, with the exception of the hepatic 
efflux transporter breast cancer resistance protein, 
for which a clinically relevant systemic inhibition 
by parent compound ibrutinib cannot be excluded 
based on in vitro data.
Formation of the glutathione adduct M26 and the 
glutathione conjugate M27 has been observed in 
vitro in human hepatocytes in the presence of 
additional glutathione, with or without additional 
recombinant human glutathione-S-transferase. In 
control human hepatocyte incubations, formation 
of M26 or M27 was not observed. In the human 
mass balance study, M26 or M27 were not 
observed; however, corresponding downstream 
metabolites were observed (M31, M32, and M33). 
Based on the human mass balance data, the 
combined glutathione-related pathways are a 
minor route of overall ibrutinib metabolism 
making up less than 5% in man. 
In in vitro studies, ibrutinib was observed to bind 
covalently to hepatic proteins such as cytochrome
P450 (CYP)3A4/5 and human hepatic 
microsomes, with and without metabolic 
activation. However, in vitro studies using human 
hepatic microsomes did not indicate a clinically 
relevant reversible or time-dependent CYP 
inhibition by ibrutinib.
There are no clinical data available. Ibrutinib may 
increase the exposure of coadministered drugs 
that undergo breast cancer resistance protein-
mediated hepatic efflux, such as rosuvastatin.
Given the known high intracellular glutathione 
content, neither glutathione depletion caused by 
ibrutinib treatment at the recommended 
therapeutic dose, nor drug interactions related to 
glutathione conjugation or addition, would be 
anticipated.
CYP isozyme activity and microsomal function 
were not affected by the covalent binding of 
ibrutinib.

Key Safety Findings
Relevance to Human Usage
Despite the observed in vitro covalent binding to 
(hepatic) proteins, there was no hepatic safety 
signal from the general toxicity program, eg, no 
adverse treatment-related changes in liver 
function parameters were noted and no adverse 
test article-mediated hepatic histopathology 
changes were observed.
Based on the general toxicity program, the liver is 
not a target organ for ibrutinib toxicity. However, 
based on the available postmarketing spontaneous 
case reports and a grade 4 hepatic enzyme 
elevation in a healthy volunteer, the risk of 
hepatotoxicity (including hepatic failure) is 
considered an important identified risk with the 
use of ibrutinib (see Module SVII).

PART II:  SAFETY SPECIFICATION
Module SIV:  Populations Not Studied in Clinical Trials
SIV.1.
Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Studies Within the Development 
Program
Important Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Trials Across the Development Program
Criterion 1
Hypersensitivity
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
Ibrutinib is contraindicated for patients with a 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the 
excipients listed in Section 6.1 of the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC).
Considered to be included as missing 
information
No
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
Criterion 2
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
This is a standard contraindication in SmPCs. To date, 
there were very few severe hypersensitivity reactions 
observed in association with ibrutinib treatment and there 
is currently no way allowing the identification of patients 
who could be hypersensitive to ibrutinib. None of the 
excipients is considered as potentially causing 
hypersensitivity reactions.
Central nervous system (CNS) involvement by 
lymphoma
Standard practice in oncology clinical trials. Inclusion of 
patients with known CNS involvement can confound the 
efficacy and safety assessments of the trial.
Considered to be included as missing 
information
No
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
Patients may have their lymphoma treated with ibrutinib 
but need additional therapy to treat the CNS involvement.
CONFIDENTIAL
45
IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib)
Risk Management Plan Version 22.1
Important Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Trials Across the Development Program
Criterion 3
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
Creatinine >1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal 
(ULN)
Early in the development program, the effects of renal 
clearance on ibrutinib pharmacokinetics and safety were 
not fully elucidated.
Considered to be included as missing 
information
No
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
Criterion 4
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
Ibrutinib has minimal renal clearance; urinary excretion of 
ibrutinib and its metabolites is <10% of the dose. There is 
no scientific rationale to expect a different safety profile 
in this population.
Total bilirubin >1.5 x institutional ULN (unless 
elevated from documented Gilbert’s syndrome).
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) >3 x institutional ULN
Ibrutinib is metabolized in the liver. Early in the 
development program, the effects of hepatic impairment 
on ibrutinib pharmacokinetics and safety were not fully 
elucidated.
Considered to be included as missing 
information
No
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
Trial PCI-32765CLL1006, which evaluated the effect of 
hepatic impairment on ibrutinib exposure, was completed.  
Criterion 5
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
As a result, a dose recommendation has been included in
the SmPC, advising dose reductions for patients with mild
(Child-Pugh class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh class B)
hepatic impairment. The SmPC states that it is not 
recommended to administer ibrutinib to patients with 
severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). 
Concomitant use of medicines known to cause QT 
prolongation or torsades de pointes1
Cardiac electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring was part of 
the assessments for the trial; therefore, medications that 
can cause significant abnormalities were prohibited. 
It is common practice to exclude such treatments prior to 
availability of QT data.
1 This was an exclusion criterion in Trials 04753, 1102, 1108, and 1118E-CA, but not in the other trials in the ibrutinib 
development program.

Risk Management Plan Version 22.1
Important Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Trials Across the Development Program
Considered to be included as missing 
information
No 
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
Criterion 6
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
Concomitant use of such medications was only prohibited 
in earlier trials with ibrutinib. Clinical data show that QTc 
intervals are not prolonged by ibrutinib. In a thorough QT 
study (PCI-32765CLL1007), a concentration-dependent 
shortening in the QTc interval was observed.
Significant screening ECG abnormalities including left 
bundle branch block, 2nd degree AV block type II, 3rd
degree block, bradycardia, or QTc 500 msec2
Cardiac ECG monitoring was part of the assessments for 
the trial; therefore, significant abnormalities at entry were 
excluded.
Considered to be included as missing 
information
No 
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
There were no findings in the clinical trials and the 
thorough QT study indicating that ibrutinib administration 
was associated with prolongation of QTc interval.
Criterion 7
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
Considered to be included as missing 
information
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
History of myocardial infarction, acute coronary 
syndromes (including unstable angina), coronary 
angioplasty, and/or stenting within the past 6 months
It is common clinical practice to exclude subjects with 
severe and potentially life-threatening concurrent cardiac 
conditions in clinical trials.
Yes (Use in patients with severe cardiac disease)
Mild to Moderate Cardiac Disease:
The observed cardiac AEs following exposure to ibrutinib 
in trials were mainly mild to moderate and not unexpected 
for trial populations (generally older males and with 
multiple pre-existing CVD).
There are no specific data available for use of ibrutinib in 
patients with severe cardiac disease. The treating 
physician would be expected to weigh the benefit and 
risks for each individual patient.
2 This was an exclusion criterion in Trials 04753, 1104, 1102, and 1108, but not in the other trials in the ibrutinib 
development program.

Important Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Trials Across the Development Program
Criterion 8
Pregnant or lactating women (female patients of 
childbearing potential must have a negative serum 
pregnancy test within 14 days of first day of drug 
dosing, or, if positive, a pregnancy ruled out by 
ultrasound)
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
Based on findings in animals, ibrutinib may cause fetal 
harm when administered to pregnant women.
Considered to be included as missing 
information
No
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
Criterion 9
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
The SmPC states that ibrutinib should not be used during 
pregnancy and that women of childbearing potential must 
use highly effective contraceptive measures while taking 
ibrutinib and for 3 months after stopping treatment. 
Breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment 
with ibrutinib as a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be 
excluded.
Known history of HIV or active infection with HCV or 
hepatitis B virus (HBV) or any uncontrolled active 
systemic infection
It is common clinical practice to exclude subjects with 
severe active infections because they potentially confound 
the interpretation of safety.
Considered to be included as missing 
information
No
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
Criterion 10
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
Infections (including viral reactivation) are included as an 
important identified risk. The treating physician would be 
expected to weigh the benefit and risks for each individual 
patient.
If subjects required anticoagulation with warfarin or 
other vitamin K antagonists
During the early Phase 1 and 2 trials in October 2011, a 
cluster of CNS hemorrhagic events were identified. Two 
external consultants (a hematologist and a neurosurgeon) 
reviewed the intracranial hemorrhage cases and felt that 
the causations were most likely due to a recent fall or use 
of warfarin.
Patients were excluded from participation in ibrutinib 
Phase 2 and 3 trials if they required warfarin or other 
vitamin K antagonists.

Risk Management Plan Version 22.1
Important Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Trials Across the Development Program
Considered to be included as missing 
information
No 
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
Hemorrhage is an important identified risk.
SmPC Section 4.4 states that there have been reports of 
bleeding events in patients treated with ibrutinib, both 
with and without thrombocytopenia. These include minor 
bleeding events such as contusion, epistaxis, and 
petechiae; and major bleeding events, some fatal, 
including GI bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and 
hematuria. 
Warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists should not be 
administered concomitantly with ibrutinib. Use of either 
anticoagulants or medicinal products that inhibit platelet 
function (antiplatelet agents) concomitantly with ibrutinib
increases the risk of major bleeding. A higher risk for 
major bleeding was observed with anticoagulant than with 
antiplatelet agents. The risks and benefits of anticoagulant 
or antiplatelet therapy should be considered when 
coadministered with ibrutinib and patients should be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding. 
Supplements such as fish oil and vitamin E preparations 
should be avoided. Ibrutinib should be held at least 3 to 
7 days pre- and post-surgery depending upon the type of 
surgery and the risk of bleeding. The mechanism for the 
bleeding-related events is not fully understood. Patients 
with congenital bleeding diathesis have not been studied.
The treating physician would be expected to weigh the 
benefit and risks for each individual patient.

The efficacy of ibrutinib in children aged 0 to <18 years has not 
yet been established as MCL, CLL, and WM are not present in 
the pediatric population. 
A Paediatric Investigation Plan for ibrutinib has been agreed and 
closed for the condition “Treatment of mature B-cell neoplasm”. 
A trial in pediatric subjects with relapsed or refractory mature 
B-cell NHL (Trial 54179060LYM3003) was completed and has 
shown no benefit of adding ibrutinib to standard-of-care 
chemoimmunotherapy. In that trial, 56 subjects were exposed to 
ibrutinib (21 subjects aged 1 to <18 years and 35 subjects aged 
1 to 30 years [initial diagnosis of mature B cell NHL was made 
before 18 years of age]). No new adverse reactions were 
observed in this study.
A Paediatric Investigation Plan for ibrutinib has been agreed for 
the condition “Treatment of cGVHD”. Two trials in pediatric 
subjects with cGVHD have been conducted
(Trials PCYC-1146-IM and PCYC-1140-IM). In total, 
62 pediatric subjects (aged 1 to <22 years) were exposed to 
ibrutinib.
There are no adequate and well controlled trials of ibrutinib in 
pregnant women. 
Ibrutinib should not be used during pregnancy. Breastfeeding 
should be discontinued during treatment with ibrutinib.
Of the 2,912 adult subjects in the all clinical trials population,
2,568 (88%) subjects were white, while 79 (3%) subjects were 
black or African American and 265 (9%) subjects were Hispanic 
or Latino, Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, or ”Other”

Method used to Calculate Exposure
Reporting  frequencies  calculated  using  exposure  data  do  not  reflect  occurrence  rates.  Multiple 
factors influence the reporting of spontaneous experiences and therefore, caution must be exercised 
in the analysis and evaluation of spontaneous reports. In addition, product exposure is estimated 
at the time of distribution, not at the time of usage. There is a delay between the times a medication 
is  distributed  until  it  is  used  by  a  patient.  Patient  exposure  was  estimated  by  calculation  from 
distribution data. Estimates of exposure are based upon finished product. Ibrutinib is marketed for 
3 indications: MCL, CLL, and WM. The recommended dosing for the MCL indication is 560 mg 
once  daily  and  for  the  CLL  and  WM  indications  is  420  mg  once  daily.  The  treatment  pattern 
between MCL:CLL is close to 1:4. Taking this indication ratio into consideration, the average use 
regardless  of  indications  per  patient  per  day  was  calculated  to  be  448 mg  (0.2*560  mg  + 
0.8*420 mg).

Potential Mechanisms:
In  an  in  vitro  study (PCYC-1132-NT),  ibrutinib  demonstrated  inhibition  of  collagen-induced 
platelet aggregation in samples from the cohorts of subjects with either renal dysfunction, those 
on  warfarin,  or  healthy  subjects.  The  magnitude  of  inhibition  of  collagen-induced  platelet 
aggregation  in  the  cohort  of  subjects  on  aspirin  was  less  pronounced  since  collagen-induced 
platelet  aggregation  was  already  reduced  without  ibrutinib.  Ibrutinib  did  not  show  meaningful 
inhibition  of  platelet  aggregation  for  the  4  agonists  adenosine  diphosphate,  arachidonic  acid,

There have been reports of bleeding events in subjects treated with ibrutinib, both with and without 
thrombocytopenia.  These include predominantly minor  bleeding events  such  as contusion, 
epistaxis, and petechiae; but also some major bleeding events, some fatal, including GI bleeding, 
intracranial hemorrhage, and hematuria. 
Mild to moderate hemorrhage is one of the most commonly occurring adverse reactions. Severe 
hemorrhage, which occurs less frequently, is a potentially life-threatening or fatal complication, 
also known to occur in the context of the underlying diseases of WM, MCL, or CLL. Patients with 
hemorrhage are treated as per standard of care.
No new safety information that impacts the risk-benefit balance of the product has emerged from 
postmarketing experience.
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
Predictors include increasing age (>60 years), history of bleeding, dose of chemotherapy, baseline 
platelet count, poor performance and/or nutritional status, and concomitant use of antiplatelet or 
anticoagulant therapy, especially warfarin use in the elderly population.

Preventability:
Risk Management Plan Version 22.1
As  stated  in  Section  4.4  of  the  SmPC,  warfarin  or  other  vitamin K  antagonists  should  not  be 
administered concomitantly with ibrutinib. Use of either anticoagulants or medicinal products that 
inhibit  platelet  function  (antiplatelet  agents)  concomitantly  with  ibrutinib  increases  the  risk  of 
major  bleeding.  A  higher  risk  for  major  bleeding  was  observed  with  anticoagulant  than  with 
antiplatelet  agents.  The  risks  and  benefits  of  anticoagulant  or  antiplatelet  therapy  should  be 
considered  when  coadministered  with ibrutinib and  patients should  be monitored for signs  and 
symptoms of bleeding. Supplements such as fish oil and vitamin E preparations should be avoided. 
The mechanism for the bleeding-related events is not fully understood. Patients with congenital 
bleeding diathesis have not been studied. Ibrutinib should be withheld at least 3 to 7 days pre- and 
post-surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding.
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product:
While occurring frequently in patients treated with ibrutinib, most cases of bleeding were mild or 
moderate and therefore had no significant impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product. Major 
hemorrhage occurs less frequently but has led to death in rare cases. The SmPC and package leaflet 
(PL) provide information to the prescriber and patient on how to manage the risk. Overall, the 
risk-benefit balance is positive for the product considering the severity of the diseases treated and 
the established efficacy and safety profile of ibrutinib.
Public Health Impact:
In  consideration  of  the  relatively  small  number  of  patients  in  the  targeted  populations  and  the 
relatively small number of major hemorrhage cases reported with ibrutinib therapy, the impact on 
public health is expected to be low.

Potential Mechanisms:
In in vitro studies, ibrutinib was observed to bind covalently to hepatic proteins such as CYP3A4/5 
and human hepatic microsomes, with and without metabolic activation. However, in vitro studies 
using human hepatic microsomes did not indicate a clinically relevant reversible or time-dependent 
CYP inhibition by ibrutinib. Despite the observed in vitro covalent binding to (hepatic) proteins, 
there  was  no  hepatic  safety  signal  from  the  general  toxicity  program,  eg,  no  treatment-related 
changes  in  liver  function  parameters  were  noted  and  no  hepatic  histopathology  changes  were 
observed.
Based on in vitro data, ibrutinib is not transported by major transporter proteins involved in hepatic 
uptake or hepatic efflux. A potential mechanism for ibrutinib-induced hepatotoxicity is unknown.
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:
A grade 4 hepatic enzyme elevation in association with ibrutinib has been observed in a healthy 
volunteer  in  a  clinical  trial.  Hepatic  failure  has  been  identified  as  an  adverse  reaction  during 
postmarketing experience. These events are described in the current prescribing information for 
ibrutinib.

In  a  thorough  QTc  Study  (PCI-32765CLL1007),  a  healthy  volunteer  experienced  reversible 
grade 4  ALT/AST  elevation  after  receiving  a  supratherapeutic  dose  (1,680  mg)  of  ibrutinib  in 
accordance  with  the  protocol.  The  subject’s  hepatic  enzyme  levels  returned  to  normal 
approximately  5 weeks  following  the  peak  elevation.  The  Sponsor  considered  that  a  causal

relationship of the liver function abnormalities in this subject to ibrutinib could not be ruled out. 
The investigator assessment was “possibly related.”
Liver abnormalities are generally non-severe. However, drug-induced liver injury could be serious
and  potentially  fatal  or  require  liver  transplant.  The  majority  of  cases  reporting  hepatotoxicity 
associated  with  ibrutinib  were  mild  to  moderate  and  resolved  with  discontinuation  or  dose 
modification.
No new safety information that impacts the risk-benefit balance of the product has emerged from 
postmarketing experience.

obesity,  and  nonalcoholic  fatty  liver  disease.  Patients  taking  other  anti-cancer  agents,  anti-
infectives, psychotropics, lipid-lowering agents, herbal and dietary supplements, and nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs are also at risk (Bahirwani and Reddy, 2014; Bell and Chalasani, 2009).
include 
Preventability:
The  SmPC  (Section  4.4)  states  that  liver  function  and  viral  hepatitis  status  should  be  assessed 
before initiating treatment with ibrutinib. Patients should be periodically monitored for changes in 
liver function parameters during treatment. For patients diagnosed with hepatic events, consulting 
a liver disease expert for management should be considered. As stated in the SmPC (Section 4.9), 
patients  who  ingest  more  than  the  recommended  dose should  be  closely  monitored  and  given 
appropriate supportive treatment.
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product:
The observed incidence of significant hepatotoxicity cases is low and therefore does not have a 
significant  impact  on  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  the  product.  Hepatic  failure  is  included  as  an 
adverse  reaction  in  the  SmPC.  Overall,  the  risk-benefit balance  is  positive  for  the  product 
considering the severity of the diseases treated and the established efficacy and safety profile of 
ibrutinib.
Public Health Impact:
In  consideration  of  the  relatively  small  number  of  patients  in  the  targeted  populations  and  the 
relatively  small  number  of  significant  hepatotoxicity  cases  reported  with  ibrutinib  therapy,  the 
impact on public health is expected to be low.

Potential Mechanisms:
Risk Management Plan Version 22.1
The potential mechanism by which ibrutinib causes atrial fibrillation is unknown at this time.
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:
Cases of atrial fibrillation in association with ibrutinib have been reported in completed clinical 
trials  (particularly  in  patients  with  cardiac  risk  factors,  hypertension,  acute  infections,  and  a 
previous history of atrial fibrillation), and are also described in the current prescribing information

With  rare  exceptions,  atrial  fibrillation  is  generally  not  life-threatening,  but  it  can  have 
considerable  effects  on  quality  of  life  and  can  cause  considerable  distress  for  some  patients.
Occasionally, if uncontrolled, it may increase the risk of thromboembolism.
No new safety information that impacts the risk-benefit balance of the product has emerged from 
postmarketing experience.
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
Atrial fibrillation is more common in men than women. Other risk factors for atrial fibrillation 
include  advanced age,  hypertension  and  other  cardiac  conditions,  obesity, and  metabolic 
syndrome. There are also indications that individuals of white European descent have a higher risk 
of atrial fibrillation compared with individuals of other races (Chugh et al, 2014). Specifically, 
among CLL patients, a Mayo Clinic study observed that increased risk of incident atrial fibrillation 
was associated with older age, male sex, valvular heart disease, and hypertension in multivariable 
analysis (Shanafelt et al, 2015).

Preventability:
Risk Management Plan Version 22.1
The SmPC (Section 4.4) states that fatal and serious cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac failure have 
occurred  in  patients  treated  with  ibrutinib.  Patients  with  advanced  age,  ECOG  performance 
status ≥2, or cardiac comorbidities may be at greater risk of events including sudden fatal cardiac 
events. Atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, ventricular tachyarrhythmia, and cardiac failure have been 
reported, particularly  in  patients  with  acute  infections or  cardiac  risk  factors  including 
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and a previous history of cardiac arrhythmia. Appropriate clinical 
evaluation of cardiac history and function should be performed prior to initiating ibrutinib. Patients 
should  be  carefully  monitored  during  treatment  for  signs  of  clinical  deterioration  of  cardiac 
function and clinically managed. Further evaluation (eg, ECG, echocardiogram), as indicated for 
patients  in  whom  there  are  cardiovascular  concerns,  should  be  considered.  For  patients  with 
relevant  risk  factors  for  cardiac  events,  the  benefit/risk  should  be  carefully  assessed  before 
initiating treatment with ibrutinib; alternative treatment may be considered. In patients with pre-
existing atrial fibrillation requiring anticoagulant therapy, alternative treatment options to ibrutinib 
should  be  considered.  In  patients  who  develop  atrial  fibrillation  on  therapy  with  ibrutinib,  a 
thorough assessment of the risk for thromboembolic disease should be undertaken. In patients at 
high  risk  and  where  alternatives  to  ibrutinib  are  nonsuitable,  tightly  controlled  treatment  with 
anticoagulants should be considered.
Additional  risk  minimization  measures  for  this  important  identified  risk  are  described  in 
Section V.2.
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product:
Treatment with ibrutinib is associated with an increased incidence of atrial fibrillation with most 
cases grade 3 or lower. The SmPC and PL provide information to the prescriber and patient on risk 
factors and how to appropriately manage the risk. Overall, the risk-benefit balance is positive for 
the product considering the severity of the diseases treated and the established efficacy and safety 
profile of ibrutinib.
Public Health Impact:
Although  the  incidence  of  atrial  fibrillation  in  patients  receiving  ibrutinib  was  higher  than  in 
patients  receiving  placebo/comparator 
in 
consideration  of  the  relatively  small  number  of  patients  in  the  targeted  populations  and  the 
relatively small number of significant atrial fibrillation cases reported with ibrutinib therapy, the 
impact on public health is expected to be low.

Important Identified Risk - Ventricular Tachyarrhythmias
Potential Mechanisms:
The potential mechanism by which ibrutinib causes ventricular tachyarrhythmias is unknown at 
this time.
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:
Cases of ventricular tachyarrhythmia in association with ibrutinib have been reported in completed 
clinical trials. Ventricular tachyarrhythmia has been included as an adverse reaction in the SmPC. 
These events are described in the current prescribing information for ibrutinib.

restarting therapy.
Additional  risk  minimization  measures  for  this  important  identified  risk  are  described  in 
Section V.2.
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product:
The  observed  incidence  of  ventricular  tachyarrhythmias  is low  and  therefore  does  not  have a 
significant  impact  on  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  the  product.  The  SmPC  and  PL  provide

established efficacy and safety profile of ibrutinib. 
Public Health Impact:
In  consideration  of  the  relatively  small  number  of  patients  in  the  targeted  populations  and  the 
relatively small number of significant cases of ventricular tachyarrhythmias reported with ibrutinib 
therapy, the impact on public health is expected to be low.

Long-term safety data presented in the Year 5 Long-term Safety Study 3038-1 final report showed 
an  increase  in  prevalence  rate  of  hypertension  events  (identified  based  on  hypertension  SMQ
narrow)  over  the  first  5  years  of  ibrutinib  treatment  in  the  Long-Term  Safety  population.  The 
prevalence rate of hypertension events of any grade was 20.2% overall (0-5 years): 10.2% in the 
first  period  (0-1  year),  13.0%  in  the  second  period  (1-2  years),  18.6%  in  the  third  period 
(2-3 years), 19.4% in the fourth period (3-4 years), and 20.5% in the fifth period (4-5 years). For 
events of Grade 3 or higher, the prevalence rate was 10.9% overall: 4.2% in the first period, 6.3% 
in the second period, 8.4% in the third period, 8.9% in the fourth period, and 9.4% in the fifth 
period.  The  prevalence  rate  of  serious  hypertension  events  was  0.9%  overall: 0.4%  in  the  first 
period, 0.6% in the second period, 0.1% in the third period, 0.2% in the fourth period, and 0% in 
the  fifth  period. Hypertensive  retinopathy  and  hypertension  resulted  in  the  discontinuation  of 
ibrutinib for 0.1% of subjects each, and there were no fatal hypertension events. The median time 
to first onset of hypertension events of Grade 3 or higher severity was 17.9 months and the median 
time to onset of the first serious hypertension event was 14.9 months.
The incidence rates of hypertension events were 20.2% overall: 10.2% in the first period, 6.6% in 
the second period, 8.9% in the third period, 8.2% in the fourth period, and 8.4% in the fifth period.
The decline in incidence rates of hypertension events to a lower stable rate after the first yearly 
period suggests the increased prevalence over time was due to ongoing hypertension rather than 
an increase in new events.

IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib)
Risk Management Plan Version 22.1
Of the 238 subjects with treatment-emergent hypertension events, 70.2% had 1 or more relevant 
risk factors for  developing hypertension,  including history of  hypertensive disorders/conditions 
(56.3%) and/or other relevant risk factors (44.5%) derived from medical histories.
Hypertension  is  a  major  risk  factor  for  stroke,  ischemic  heart  disease  (including  myocardial 
infarction), heart failure, aneurysms of the arteries (eg, aortic aneurysm), and peripheral arterial 
disease, and is also a cause of chronic kidney disease. Even moderate elevation of arterial blood 
pressure  is  associated  with  a  shortened  life  expectancy.  Quality  of  life  of  individuals  with 
hypertension is worse than that of normotensive individuals. However, an overall improved quality 
of life of an individual patient is expected if a better control of blood pressure can be achieved.
No new safety information that impacts the risk-benefit balance of the product has emerged from 
postmarketing experience. However, changes to the characterization of this risk have been made
based on clinical trial data from long-term Safety Study 3038-1.
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
Risk factors for hypertension include increasing age, black race, family history of hypertension, 
being overweight or obese, physical inactivity, tobacco use, excess salt (sodium) in diet, too little 
potassium and vitamin D in diet, excess alcohol use, and stress (Mayo Clinic, High blood Pressure 
[Hypertension], 2018).
Preventability:
The incidence of hypertension is high in this patient population. A heart-healthy lifestyle such as 
healthy diet with reduced salt, regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding 
tobacco smoke, and limiting alcohol intake can help to prevent high blood pressure. As stated in 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC, blood pressure should be regularly monitored in patients treated with 
ibrutinib and antihypertensive medication should be initiated or adjusted throughout treatment with 
ibrutinib as appropriate.
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product:
Hypertension  has  been  observed  at  a  higher  incidence  with  ibrutinib  than  with  comparators  in 
randomized, controlled Phase 3 trials; most events were grade 3 or lower. Long-term safety data 
showed an increase in prevalence rate of hypertension events (any grade and grade 3 or higher) 
over 5 years of ibrutinib treatment; however, few events were serious or resulted in discontinuation 
of  ibrutinib. Hypertension  is  an  acknowledged  adverse  reaction  and  Section 4.4  of  the  SmPC 
provides recommendations  for  blood  pressure  monitoring  and  management  of  patients  with 
hypertension. Overall, the risk-benefit balance remains positive for the product considering the 
severity of the diseases treated and the established efficacy and safety profile of ibrutinib.

Public Health Impact:
Risk Management Plan Version 22.1
In  consideration  of  the  relatively  small  number  of  patients  in  the  targeted  populations  and  the 
relatively small number of significant cases of hypertension reported with ibrutinib therapy, the 
impact on public health is expected to be low.

Important Identified Risk – Ischemic Stroke
Potential Mechanisms:
Risk Management Plan Version 22.1
An increased risk of stroke in patients taking ibrutinib is theoretically possible, given the known 
association of stroke with ibrutinib-associated cardiovascular adverse effects of atrial fibrillation 
and hypertension. However, from a direct mechanism standpoint and based on available data, a 
causal relationship cannot be established between ibrutinib and the occurrence of stroke. Patients 
treated with ibrutinib are generally at an increased risk for stroke events based on their advanced 
age as well as the underlying malignancy (ie, hypercoagulable state). 
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:
Cases of ischemic stroke in association with ibrutinib have been reported in completed clinical 
trials. Cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, and ischemic stroke have been included 
as adverse reactions in the SmPC, based on the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee 
(PRAC) assessment (procedure EMA/PRAC/510313/2019,  European Pharmacovigilance  Issues 
Tracking Tool [EPITT] number 19369) of the signal evaluation of ischemic stroke conducted by 
the  MAH,  considering  the  established  cardiac  risks  of  atrial  fibrillation  and  hypertension 
associated with ibrutinib administration. Although, from a direct mechanism standpoint and based 
on available data, causality between stroke and treatment with ibrutinib has not been established, 
ischemic stroke was added to the EU-RMP as an important identified risk as requested by PRAC 
(procedure EMEA/H/C/003791/II/0061), in conjunction with the addition of ischemic stroke to 
Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC.

There have been reports of cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, and ischemic stroke 
including  fatalities  in  subjects  treated  with  ibrutinib,  both  with  and  without  concomitant  atrial 
fibrillation and/or hypertension. Latency from the initiation of treatment with ibrutinib to the onset 
of  ischemic  central  nervous  vascular  conditions  was  in  the  most  cases  after  several  months 
(more than 1 month in 78% and more than 6 months in 44% of cases), emphasizing the need for 
regular monitoring of patients.
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
The most frequent causes of ischemic stroke in cancer patients are cerebrovascular risk factors 
such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and tobacco use. Additionally, 
patients receiving treatment with ibrutinib are mostly elderly  and most  strokes occur in people 
aged >65 years.
Preventability:
A  heart-healthy  lifestyle  such  as  healthy  diet  with  reduced  cholesterol/saturated  fat,  regular 
physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding tobacco smoke, and limiting stress and 
alcohol  intake  can  help  to  prevent  a  stroke,  as  well  as  regular  heart  rate  and  blood  pressure 
monitoring.  As  stated  in  Section  4.4  of  the  SmPC,  patients  treated  with  ibrutinib  should  be 
regularly monitored, as among cases with reported latency, the initiation of ibrutinib treatment to 
the onset of ischemic central nervous vascular conditions was in most cases after several months.

IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib)
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product:
Risk Management Plan Version 22.1
The observed incidence of ischemic stroke is low and therefore does not have a significant impact 
on the risk-benefit balance of the product. Cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, and 
ischemic  stroke  have  been  added  as  adverse  reactions  in  the  SmPC.  Overall,  the  risk-benefit 
balance remains positive for the product considering the severity of the diseases treated and the 
established efficacy and safety profile of ibrutinib.
Public Health Impact:
In  consideration  of  the  relatively  small  number  of  patients  in  the  targeted  populations  and  the 
relatively small number of significant cases of ischemic stroke reported with ibrutinib therapy, the 
impact on public health is expected to be low.

Important Identified Risk – Cardiac Failure
Potential Mechanisms:
Risk Management Plan Version 22.1
The potential mechanism by which ibrutinib may cause cardiac failure is unknown at this time. 
However, ibrutinib is known to be associated with atrial fibrillation, a risk factor that could lead 
to reduced cardiac output.
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:
Cases of cardiac failure in association with ibrutinib have been reported in completed clinical trials. 
Although no direct causal association between ibrutinib and cardiac failure was established, based 
on the number of cardiac failure cases from the postmarketing setting and the known association 
between ibrutinib and atrial fibrillation (a risk factor that could lead to reduced cardiac output), 
cardiac failure has been included as an adverse reaction in the SmPC.

10FEB2022, 23:41
Cardiac failure can be debilitating and potentially fatal. Cases of cardiac failure including fatalities 
have  been  reported  in  patients  treated  with  ibrutinib,  with  and  without  concomitant  atrial 
fibrillation. The majority of the cases occurred in elderly patients (≥65 years) with the median age 
being 76. In some of the cases, cardiac failure resolved or improved after ibrutinib withdrawal or 
dose reduction.
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
Patients  with  known  cardiac  risk  factors  (eg,  age  65  years  or  older,  diabetes  mellitus, 
hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, smoking), pre-existing heart disease, acute 
severe infection, and a previous history of cardiotoxic cancer therapy, such as anthracyclines, are 
at higher risk  for developing  cardiac failure. Concomitant atrial fibrillation is  a risk factor that 
could lead to reduced cardiac output. African Americans and South Asians are ethnic groups with 
higher risk (Lawson et al, 2020).

Preventability:
Risk Management Plan Version 22.1
The SmPC (Section 4.4) states that fatal and serious cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac failure have 
occurred  in  patients  treated  with  ibrutinib.  Patients  with  advanced  age,  ECOG  performance 
status ≥2, or cardiac comorbidities may be at greater risk of events including sudden fatal cardiac 
events. Atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, ventricular tachyarrhythmia, and cardiac failure have been 
reported,  particularly  in  patients  with  acute  infections  or  cardiac  risk  factors  including 
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and a previous history of cardiac arrhythmia. Appropriate clinical 
evaluation of cardiac history and function should be performed prior to initiating ibrutinib. Patients 
should  be  carefully  monitored  during  treatment  for  signs  of  clinical  deterioration  of  cardiac 
function and clinically managed. Further evaluation (eg, ECG, echocardiogram), as indicated for 
patients  in  whom  there  are  cardiovascular  concerns,  should  be  considered.  For  patients  with 
relevant  risk  factors  for  cardiac  events,  the  benefit/risk  should  be  carefully  assessed  before 
initiating  treatment  with  ibrutinib;  alternative  treatment  may  be  considered.  Patients  should  be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of cardiac failure during ibrutinib treatment. In some of these 
cases cardiac failure resolved or improved after ibrutinib withdrawal or dose reduction.
Additional  risk  minimization  measures  for  this  important  identified  risk  are  described  in 
Section V.2.
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product:
Cardiac  failure  has  been  observed  in  patients  treated  with  ibrutinib  and  has  been  added  as  an 
adverse reaction in the SmPC. The SmPC and PL provide information to the prescriber and patient 
on  how  to  manage  the  risk.  Overall,  the  risk-benefit  balance  remains  positive  for  the  product 
considering the severity of the diseases treated and the established efficacy and safety profile of 
ibrutinib.
Public Health Impact:
In  consideration  of  the  relatively  small  number  of  patients  in  the  targeted  populations  and  the
relatively small number of significant cases of cardiac failure reported with ibrutinib therapy, the 
impact on public health is expected to be low.

Important Identified Risk - Infections (Including Viral Reactivation)
Potential Mechanisms:
Patients with underlying hematological diseases often have an impaired immune system, making 
them more prone to infections. The underlying mechanism for increased risk of infection during 
ibrutinib treatment is not fully understood. Many factors should be taken into consideration, such 
as biological features of the disease (low vs high-risk), hypogammaglobulinemia with or without 
ongoing Ig substitution, previous and concomitant treatment (eg, steroids, anti-CD20 antibodies, 
or chemotherapies), exposure to environmental risk factors, concurrent neutropenia, and the effect 
of BTK inhibition on native and adaptive immunity. Baseline factors such as diabetes mellitus, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma, and/or lymphopenia may increase the risk.
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:
Cases of infections (including sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, bacterial, viral, or fungal infection) in 
association with ibrutinib have been reported in completed clinical trials and are also described in 
the current prescribing information for ibrutinib.

Risk Management Plan Version 22.1
In  Trial  DBL3001,  the  overall  safety  population  showed  a  higher  incidence  of  serious 
treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs),  grade ≥3  serious  TEAEs,  and  TEAEs  leading  to 
study  drug  discontinuation  in  the  ibrutinib  560 mg+R-CHOP  treatment  group  compared  to  the 
placebo+R-CHOP treatment group. The difference was more pronounced for older subjects (aged 
≥65 years) compared with younger subjects. Infections were reported with a higher incidence for 
the  ibrutinib+R-CHOP  treatment  group  (57.2%)  versus  the  placebo+R-CHOP  treatment  group 
(43.5%) regardless of age and were reported more frequently in the ibrutinib+R-CHOP treatment 
group (63.6%) versus the placebo+R-CHOP treatment group (46.9%) for subjects aged ≥65 years. 
The  most  common  infections  were  respiratory  related  (pneumonia,  upper  respiratory  tract 
infections).  Infections  were  the  most  commonly  reported  TEAE  with  an  outcome  of  death  for 
subjects aged ≥65 years in the ibrutinib+R-CHOP treatment group. Fewer younger subjects died 
compared with older subjects. Febrile neutropenia was reported with a higher incidence for the 
ibrutinib+R-CHOP  treatment  group  (25.5%)  versus  the  placebo+R-CHOP  treatment  group 
(14.8%) regardless of age and was reported more frequently in the ibrutinib+R-CHOP treatment 
group (29.4%) versus the placebo+R-CHOP treatment group (16.9%) for subjects aged ≥65 years.
The observed adverse reactions that occurred with ibrutinib in combination with R-CHOP were 
consistent  with  the  known  adverse  reaction  profile  of  ibrutinib  in  the  B-cell  malignancy 
randomized  controlled  trial  population.  Use  of  ibrutinib  for  treatment  of  DLBCL  and  use  of 
ibrutinib in combination with R-CHOP are not submitted/approved ibrutinib indications.
No new safety information that impacts the risk-benefit balance of the product has emerged from 
postmarketing experience.
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
Predictors include increasing age (>60 years), underlying immunosuppression that is inherent to 
the  primary  disease  process,  therapy-related  immunosuppression,  concomitant  chemotherapy, 
absence of antibiotic prophylaxis, and poor performance and/or nutritional status.
Preventability:
The SmPC (Section 4.4) states that prophylaxis should be considered according to standard of care 
in patients who are at increased risk for opportunistic infections. Patients should be monitored for 
fever,  abnormal  liver  function  tests,  neutropenia,  and  infections  and  appropriate  anti-infective 
therapy  should  be  instituted  as indicated. Liver  function  and  viral  hepatitis  status  should  be 
assessed  before  initiating  treatment  with  ibrutinib.  As  clinically  indicated,  viral  load  and 
serological testing for infectious hepatitis should be performed per local medical guidelines. For 
patients diagnosed with viral hepatitis, consulting a liver disease expert for management should be 
considered.

Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product:
Risk Management Plan Version 22.1
Infections  are  frequently  observed  in  patients  with  hematological  malignancies and  a  potential 
association with the use of ibrutinib cannot be excluded. The SmPC and PL provide information 
to the prescriber and patient on how to manage the risk. Overall, the risk-benefit balance is positive 
for the product considering the severity of the diseases treated and the established efficacy and 
safety profile of ibrutinib.
Public Health Impact:
Overall, the  frequency  of  grade  3  or  higher  infections  tends  to  be  higher  in ibrutinib  versus
comparators used in Phase 3 randomized controlled clinical trials. Given that most of these events 
are  clinically  manageable  and  reversible,  and  that  the  number  of  patients  in  the  targeted 
populations is relatively small, infections associated with ibrutinib therapy is not likely to have a 
significant impact on public health.

IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib)
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
Risk Management Plan Version 22.1
PML is  a  demyelinating  disorder  of  the  CNS,  caused  by  the  reactivation  of  the commonly
occurring JC virus, which remains inactive in healthy individuals, and causes disease only when 
the immune system has been compromized (Lopes da Silva, 2012). PML usually occurs during 
severe  immunosuppression  and  the  most  common  causes  are  represented  by  HIV  infection, 
lymphoproliferative  disorders,  and  other  forms  of  cancer.  The  use  of  monoclonal  antibodies 
(eg, natalizumab, rituximab, efalizumab) in the treatment of several dysimmune diseases such as 
multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and systemic lupus erythematosus, has led to an 
increased incidence of PML (Tavazzi et al, 2011). Chemotherapy and immunosuppressive therapy 
are considered to be the primary risk factors in addition to HIV infection (Carson et al, 2009). In 
one analysis, 3 significant risk factors for developing PML in CLL patients were identified: age 
(>55 years), male sex, and CD4 cell count <200 cells/μL (Lopes da Silva, 2012).
A  retrospective,  monocentric  cohort  study  of  976  NHL  patients,  including  517  patients  who 
received at least one dose of rituximab, concluded that the inclusion of rituximab into standard 
chemotherapy  regimens  for  NHL  caused  a  significantly  higher  incidence  of  PML  cases 
(rate difference: 2.2 every 1,000 patient-years; 95% CI: 0.1-4.3) (Tuccori et al, 2010).
Preventability:
The SmPC (Section 4.4) states that physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis 
in patients with new or  worsening neurological, cognitive, or behavioral signs or symptoms. If 
PML  is  suspected,  appropriate diagnostic  evaluations  should  be  undertaken  and  treatment 
suspended  until PML is  excluded.  If any doubt exists,  referral to a neurologist and appropriate 
diagnostic  measures  for  PML,  including  magnetic  resonance  imaging  scan  preferably  with 
contrast, cerebrospinal fluid testing for JC viral DNA and repeat neurological assessments, should 
be considered.
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product:
The observed incidence of PML is low and therefore does not have a significant impact on the 
risk-benefit balance of the product. The SmPC and PL provide information to the prescriber and 
patient on how to manage the risk. Overall, the  risk-benefit balance is  positive for the product 
considering the severity of the diseases treated and the established efficacy and safety profile of 
ibrutinib.
Public Health Impact:
In consideration of the relatively small number of patients in the targeted populations and the small 
number of PML cases reported with ibrutinib therapy, the impact on public health is expected to 
be low.

The effect of ibrutinib on the QTc interval was evaluated in 20 healthy male and female subjects 
in  a  randomized,  double-blind  thorough  QT  trial (Trial  PCI-32765CLL1007)  with  placebo  and 
positive  controls.  At  a  supratherapeutic  dose  of  1,680 mg,  ibrutinib  did  not  prolong  the  QTc 
interval to any clinically relevant extent. The largest upper bound of the 2-sided 90% CI for the 
baseline-adjusted mean differences between ibrutinib and placebo was below 10 ms. In this same 
trial,  a  concentration-dependent  shortening  in  the  QTc  interval  was  observed  (-5.3 ms 
[90% CI: -9.4, -1.1] at a Cmax of 719 ng/mL following the supratherapeutic dose of 1,680 mg) that 
was considered not clinically relevant.
Cardiac  arrhythmia  can be  debilitating  and potentially  fatal.  Patients  with  cardiac  arrhythmias 
experience various symptoms that could result in decreased quality of life. In rare cases, sudden 
death could occur as an outcome of cardiac arrhythmias (Huikuri et al, 2001). The search strategy 
for Cardiac arrhythmias (SMQ) includes the PTs of Sudden death and Sudden cardiac death. In 
the  company-sponsored  pooled  randomized  clinical  trials,  an  imbalance  in  exposure-adjusted 
incidence rate for sudden death and sudden cardiac death events was observed in the ibrutinib arm 
(0.0002) versus the comparator arm (0.0001). The subjects who had such events mostly presented 
with  preexisting  cardiac  comorbidities  at  baseline.  The  postmarketing  reporting  frequency  of 
sudden death or sudden cardiac death was 15.8 cases per 100,000 person-years (assigned as rare),

No other relevant new safety information that impacts the risk-benefit balance of the product has 
emerged from postmarketing experience.
Risk Management Plan Version 22.1
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
Arrhythmias are common in older people. Risk factors include myocardial infarction, heart failure 
or cardiomyopathy, cardiac hypertrophy, incompetent or stenotic heart valves, or congenital heart 
defects.  Risk  can  also  be  increased  if  the  patient  has  hypertension,  myocarditis,  pericarditis, 
diabetes  mellitus,  sleep  apnea,  electrolyte  imbalance  (eg,  hyperkalemia  and  hypomagnesemia), 
hypothyroidism, or hyperthyroidism (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 2011).
Preventability:
The SmPC (Section 4.4) states that fatal and serious cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac failure have 
occurred  in  patients  treated  with  ibrutinib.  Patients  with  advanced  age,  ECOG  performance 
status ≥2, or cardiac comorbidities may be at greater risk of events including sudden fatal cardiac 
events. Atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, ventricular tachyarrhythmia and cardiac failure have been 
reported,  particularly  in  patients  with  acute  infections  or  cardiac  risk  factors  including 
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and a previous history of cardiac arrhythmia. Appropriate clinical 
evaluation of cardiac history and function should be performed prior to initiating ibrutinib. Patients 
should  be  carefully  monitored  during  treatment  for  signs  of  clinical  deterioration  of  cardiac 
function and clinically managed. Further evaluation (eg, ECG, echocardiogram), as indicated for 
patients  in  whom  there  are  cardiovascular  concerns,  should  be  considered. For  patients  with 
relevant  risk  factors  for  cardiac  events,  the  benefit/risk  should  be  carefully  assessed  before 
initiating treatment with ibrutinib; alternative treatment may be considered.
Additional  risk  minimization  measures  for  this  important  potential  risk  are  described  in 
Section V.2.
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product:
Cardiac  arrhythmia  (excluding  atrial  fibrillation  and  ventricular  tachyarrhythmias)  has  been 
observed in patients treated with ibrutinib. The SmPC and PL provide information to the prescriber 
and patient on how to manage the risk. Overall, the risk-benefit balance is positive for the product 
considering the severity of the diseases treated and the established efficacy and safety profile of 
ibrutinib.
Public Health Impact:
In  consideration  of  the  relatively small  number  of  patients  in  the  targeted  populations  and  the 
relatively small number of significant cases of cardiac arrhythmia reported with ibrutinib therapy, 
the impact on public health is expected to be low.

colorectal, lung, breast, and prostate cancers. 
Some second malignancies appear to be less amenable to treatment than primary tumors of the 
same  histologic  type.  The  best  example  of  this  is  therapy-related  acute  myelogenous  leukemia 
(AML) where  the  prognosis  is  much  worse  than  for  de  novo  AML.  Presumably, this  reflects 
enhanced  mutations  and  other  molecular  genetic  abnormalities  stemming  from  exposure  to 
chemotherapy or radiation. Treatment for a second cancer must also take into account the toxicity 
from the initial therapy (Rheingold et al, 2003).
Therapeutic options for second primary cancers are often compromised by the therapy for the first 
neoplasm,  but  early  diagnosis  can  often  lead  to  successful  treatment  of  most  second  primary 
cancers.
No new safety information that impacts the risk-benefit balance of the product has emerged from 
postmarketing experience.

Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
Risk Management Plan Version 22.1
The  chance  of  developing  a  second  cancer  depends  on  a  number  of  factors  including  type  of 
primary cancer, age at diagnosis, sex, types of therapy given, environmental exposures, genetic 
predisposition, and health decisions. Radiation has long been associated with the development of 
primary  cancers  and,  when  used  as  treatment,  imparts  a  risk  for  the  development  of  a  second 
cancer. 
Leukemia as a second primary cancer can occur following treatment with chemotherapy. Although 
AML is the most common type of therapy-related leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic 
myelogenous
reported. 
Chemotherapy-induced myeloid leukemias are relatively resistant to subsequent therapy and have 
a cure rate of only 10% to 20%, stressing the importance of primary prevention (Bhatia et al, 1999; 
Neugut et al, 1990; Felix, 1999).
leukemia,  and  myelodysplastic 
syndrome  have  also  been 
Preventability:
Identifying those who  are at  greater  risk for  multiple neoplasms can help medical providers to 
better monitor for second neoplasms and advise patients on ways of reducing risks.
Many  groups  of  high-risk individuals  are  already  known,  and  several  ways  of  reducing  the 
incidence  of  second  cancers  are  underway.  The  knowledge  that  certain  agents  and  regimens 
increase the risk of second malignancies has prompted oncologists to modify therapy.
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product:
The observed incidence of other malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) is relatively 
low. Based on available data, other malignancies have not been identified as an adverse reaction 
in the SmPC. Overall, the risk-benefit balance is positive for the product considering the severity 
of the diseases treated and the established efficacy and safety profile of ibrutinib.
Public Health Impact:
In  consideration  of  the  relatively  small  number  of  patients  in  the  targeted  populations  and  the 
relatively small number of serious or severe events of other malignancies reported with ibrutinib 
therapy, the impact on public health is expected to be low.

Presentation of the Missing Information
Missing information: Use in patients with severe cardiac disease
Evidence source:  The subjects in the clinical trials included older subjects with multiple pre-existing 
CVD. However, patients with severe cardiac diseases (eg, New York Heart Association class III or 
higher) were excluded from ibrutinib clinical trials.
Population in need of further characterization:  For the use of ibrutinib in patients with severe cardiac 
disease, a risk cannot be defined based upon currently available evidence.

Risk Management Plan Version 22.1
A Direct Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC) will be distributed in EU Member States
Objective(s):
The aim of this DHPC is to increase awareness of the 
following important risks associated with the use of ibrutinib 
and to provide guidance on how to manage these risks:
Important identified risks
 Atrial fibrillation
 Ventricular tachyarrhythmias
 Cardiac failure
Important potential risks
 Cardiac arrhythmia (excluding atrial fibrillation and 
ventricular tachyarrhythmias)
Missing information
 Use in patients with severe cardiac disease
The rationale of this DHPC is to inform prescribers of 
important cardiac risks associated with the use of ibrutinib, 
provide background and recommendations on how to manage 
these risks, and to direct the prescriber’s attention to follow 
the new dose modification guidelines for patients with new 
onset or worsening cardiac arrhythmia or cardiac failure.
Hematologists, oncologists, cardiologists, and any other 
relevant target groups like hospital pharmacists as agreed at 
national level.
Routine pharmacovigilance surveillance systems are used to 
detect safety signals based on AE reporting rates and trends. 
In addition, reporting trend analyses from postmarketing 
safety data are monitored in the Periodic Benefit Risk 
Evaluation Report (PBRER)/Periodic Safety Update Report 
(PSUR). Assessments are conducted at the end of each 
PBRER/PSUR reporting interval.
Stable or declined AE reporting rates and trends from the 
postmarketing safety data are the criteria for success.

PART VI:  SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
Risk Management Plan Version 22.1
Summary of Risk Management Plan for IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib)
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  IMBRUVICA.  The  RMP  details 
important risks of IMBRUVICA, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information 
will be obtained about IMBRUVICA's risks and uncertainties (missing information).
IMBRUVICA's  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet (PL) give 
essential  information  to  healthcare  professionals  (HCPs)  and  patients  on  how  IMBRUVICA
should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for IMBRUVICA should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part 
of the European Public Assessment Report.
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of 
IMBRUVICA's RMP.
I.
The Medicine and What it is Used For
IMBRUVICA is  authorized  for  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  chronic  lymphocytic  leukemia 
(CLL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), or Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM) (see SmPC 
for  the  full  indications).  It  contains  ibrutinib as  the  active  substance  and  it  is  given  as  140 mg 
capsules or as immediate release film-coated tablets for oral administration (140, 280, 420, and 
560 mg).
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  IMBRUVICA’s  benefits  can  be  found  in 
IMBRUVICA’s European Public Assessment Report, including in its plain-language summary, 
available on the European Medicines Agency website, under the medicine’s webpage:
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/imbruvica
II.
Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimize or Further 
Characterize the Risks
Important risks of IMBRUVICA, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about IMBRUVICA's risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:


Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the PL
and SmPC addressed to patients and HCPs;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
CONFIDENTIAL
140
IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib)
Risk Management Plan Version 22.1


The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly;
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly  analyzed,  including  Periodic  Benefit  Risk  Evaluation  Report/Periodic  Safety  Update 
Report assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute 
routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of IMBRUVICA is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A.
List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of IMBRUVICA are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important risks 
can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient 
proof of a link with the use of IMBRUVICA. Potential risks are concerns for which an association 
with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been 
established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to  information  on  the 
safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the long-
term use of the medicine).

Risk factors and risk groups
A grade 4 hepatic enzyme elevation in association with ibrutinib 
has been observed in a healthy volunteer in a clinical trial. Hepatic 
failure has been identified as an adverse reaction during 
postmarketing experience. These events are described in the 
current prescribing information for ibrutinib.
Risk factors for drug-induced liver toxicity include increasing age, 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency 
syndrome infection and antiretroviral drug use, chronic hepatitis B
virus or hepatitis C virus infection, obesity, and nonalcoholic fatty 
liver disease. Patients taking other anti-cancer agents, anti-
infectives, psychotropics, lipid-lowering agents, herbal and dietary 
supplements, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are also at

Risk factors and risk groups
Cases of atrial fibrillation in association with ibrutinib have been 
reported in completed clinical trials (particularly in patients with 
cardiac risk factors, hypertension, acute infections, and a previous 
history of atrial fibrillation), and are also described in the current 
prescribing information for ibrutinib.
Atrial fibrillation is more common in men than women. Other risk 
factors for atrial fibrillation include advanced age, hypertension 
and other cardiac conditions, obesity and metabolic syndrome. 
There are also indications that individuals of white European 
descent have a higher risk of atrial fibrillation compared with 
individuals of other races. Specifically, among CLL patients, a 
Mayo Clinic study observed that increased risk of incident atrial 
fibrillation was associated with older age, male sex, valvular heart 
disease, and hypertension in multivariable analysis.

Cases of ventricular tachyarrhythmia in association with ibrutinib 
have been reported in completed clinical trials. Ventricular 
tachyarrhythmia has been included as an adverse reaction in the 
SmPC. These events are described in the current prescribing 
information for ibrutinib.
Ventricular tachyarrhythmias are common in older people. Risk 
factors include myocardial infarction, heart failure or 
cardiomyopathy, cardiac hypertrophy, incompetent or stenotic 
heart valves, or congenital heart defects. Risk can also be increased 
if the patient has hypertension, myocarditis, pericarditis, diabetes 
mellitus, sleep apnea, electrolyte imbalance (eg, hyperkalemia and 
hypomagnesemia), hypothyroidism, or hyperthyroidism.

Important Identified Risk: Ischemic stroke
Risk Management Plan Version 22.1
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
Cases of ischemic stroke in association with ibrutinib have been 
reported in completed clinical trials. Cerebrovascular accident, 
transient ischemic attack, and ischemic stroke have been included 
as adverse reactions in the SmPC, based on the Pharmacovigilance 
Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) assessment of the signal 
evaluation of ischemic stroke conducted by the Marketing 
Authorization Holder, considering the established cardiac risks of 
atrial fibrillation and hypertension associated with ibrutinib 
administration. Although, from a direct mechanism standpoint and 
based on available data, causality between stroke and treatment 
with ibrutinib has not been established, ischemic stroke was added 
to the European Union Risk Management Plan as an important 
identified risk as requested by PRAC, in conjunction with the 
addition of ischemic stroke to Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC.
The most frequent causes of ischemic stroke in cancer patients are 
cerebrovascular risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, 
diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and tobacco use. Additionally, patients 
receiving treatment with ibrutinib are mostly elderly and most 
strokes occur in people aged >65 years.

Cases of cardiac failure in association with ibrutinib have been 
reported in completed clinical trials. Although no direct causal 
association between ibrutinib and cardiac failure was established, 
based on the number of cardiac failure cases from the 
postmarketing setting and the known association between ibrutinib 
and atrial fibrillation (a risk factor that could lead to reduced 
cardiac output), cardiac failure has been included as an adverse 
reaction in the SmPC.

Risk factors and risk groups
Risk Management Plan Version 22.1
Patients with known cardiac risk factors (eg, age 65 years or older, 
diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease, 
hypertension, smoking), pre-existing heart disease, acute severe 
infection, and a previous history of cardiotoxic cancer therapy, 
such as anthracyclines, are at higher risk for developing cardiac 
failure. Concomitant atrial fibrillation is a risk factor that could 
lead to reduced cardiac output. African Americans and South 
Asians are ethnic groups with higher risk.

Important Potential Risk: Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
Cases of PML (within the context of a prior or concomitant 
immunosuppressive therapy) in association with ibrutinib have 
been reported in completed clinical trials and during postmarketing 
experience, and are also described in the current prescribing 
information for ibrutinib. PML has not been identified as an 
adverse reaction.
PML is a demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system, 
caused by the reactivation of the commonly occurring John 
Cunningham virus, which remains inactive in healthy individuals, 
and causes disease only when the immune system has been 
compromised. PML usually occurs during severe 
immunosuppression and the most common causes are represented 
by HIV infection, lymphoproliferative disorders, and other forms 
of cancer. The use of monoclonal antibodies (eg, natalizumab, 
rituximab, efalizumab) in the treatment of several dysimmune 
diseases such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, 
and systemic lupus erythematosus, has led to an increased 
incidence of PML. Chemotherapy and immunosuppressive therapy 
are considered to be the primary risk factors in addition to HIV 
infection. In one analysis, 3 significant risk factors for developing 
PML in CLL patients were identified: age (>55 years), male sex, 
and CD4 cell count <200 cells/μL.
A retrospective, monocentric cohort study of 976 non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma patients, including 517 patients who received at least 
one dose of rituximab, concluded that the inclusion of rituximab 
into standard chemotherapy regimens for non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma caused a significantly higher incidence of PML cases 
(rate difference: 2.2 every 1,000 patient-years; 95% confidence 
interval: 0.1-4.3).

IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib)
Risk Management Plan Version 22.1
Important Potential Risk: Cardiac arrhythmia (excluding atrial fibrillation and ventricular 
tachyarrhythmias)
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine
Cases of cardiac arrhythmia in association with ibrutinib have been 
reported in completed clinical trials, and are also described in the 
current prescribing information for ibrutinib.
Risk factors and risk groups
Arrhythmias are common in older people. Risk factors include 
myocardial infarction, heart failure or cardiomyopathy, cardiac 
hypertrophy, incompetent or stenotic heart valves, or congenital 
heart defects. Risk can also be increased if the patient has 
hypertension, myocarditis, pericarditis, diabetes mellitus, sleep 
apnea, electrolyte imbalance (eg, hyperkalemia and 
hypomagnesemia), hypothyroidism, or hyperthyroidism.

 A recommendation regarding further evaluation (eg, ECG, 
echocardiogram) for patients in whom there are cardiovascular 
concerns is provided in SmPC Section 4.4
 A recommendation for careful assessment of the benefit/risk 
before initiating treatment with ibrutinib in patients with 
relevant risk factors for cardiac events, including consideration 
of alternative treatment, is provided in SmPC Section 4.4

Instructions and criteria for ibrutinib treatment interruption, 
dose modification, and treatment discontinuation in patients 
who develop grade 3 or higher cardiac arrhythmias are 
provided in SmPC Section 4.2
 Warning for patients with (history of) irregular heart beat is 
provided in PL Section 2
 Legal status: restricted medical prescription
Additional risk minimization measures: 
 DHPC to inform prescribers of important cardiac risks 
associated with the use of ibrutinib, provide background and

IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib)
Risk Management Plan Version 22.1
Important Potential Risk: Other malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer)
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
Cases of other malignancies (including solid tumors and 
hematologic tumors) in association with ibrutinib have been 
reported in ongoing and completed clinical trials. Other 
malignancies has not been identified as an adverse reaction.
The chance of developing a second cancer depends on a number of 
factors including type of primary cancer, age at diagnosis, sex, 
types of therapy given, environmental exposures, genetic 
predisposition, and health decisions. Radiation has long been 
associated with the development of primary cancers and, when 
used as treatment, imparts a risk for the development of a second 
cancer. 
Leukemia as a second primary cancer can occur following 
treatment with chemotherapy. Although acute myelogenous 
leukemia is the most common type of therapy-related leukemia, 
acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and 
myelodysplastic syndrome have also been reported. 
Chemotherapy-induced myeloid leukemias are relatively resistant 
to subsequent therapy and have a cure rate of only 10% to 20%, 
stressing the importance of primary prevention.

the 
The  DHPC  addresses 
identified  risks  ‘atrial  fibrillation’,  ‘ventricular 
tachyarrhythmias’,  and  ‘cardiac  failure’;  the  important  potential  risk  ‘cardiac  arrhythmia 
(excluding atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias)’; and the missing information ‘use 
in patients with severe cardiac disease’.
important 
The specific objective is to increase awareness of HCPs to the possible safety concerns described 
above and to provide guidance for risk mitigation.

Inform  that  the  Special  Warnings  and  Precautions  for  Use  section  (Section  4.4)  of  the 
IMBRUVICA  SmPC  has  been  revised  with  additional  information  on  cardiac  arrhythmias, 
cardiac  failure,  and  sudden  fatal  cardiac  events,  including  a  description  of  risk  factors  and 
guidelines for assessment and management to help prescribers.
Inform  that
the  dose  modification  recommendations  in  the  Posology  and  Method  of 
Administration  section  (Section  4.2)  of  the  SmPC  have  been  updated  for  events  of  cardiac

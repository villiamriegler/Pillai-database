2.  Scientific discussion
2.1.  Problem statement
2.1.1.  Disease or condition
Sogroya is indicated for the replacement of endogenous growth hormone (GH) in adults with growth 
hormone deficiency (AGHD).
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of 
indication variation 
EMA/268297/2023 
Page 9/96
In the current variation procedure, it is proposed to extend the indication to endogenous growth 
hormone (GH) in children and adolescents with growth failure due to growth hormone deficiency 
(GHD).
The initially proposed indication in this variation procedure is (added text: underlined):
Replacement of endogenous GH in children and adolescents with growth failure due to growth 
hormone deficiency (paediatric GHD) and in adults with growth hormone deficiency (adult GHD).
Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is characterised by too low systemic levels of growth hormone. 
Growth hormone (GH) is produced by the somatotroph cells of the anterior pituitary gland. The 
secretion of growth hormone from the pituitary gland is stimulated by growth hormone-releasing 
hormone (GHRH) and inhibited by somatostatin, both of which are produced by the hypothalamus. 
Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is often associated with defects arising in the pituitary gland or the 
hypothalamus. 
The typical symptom of GHD in children is growth failure. Growth failure is suspected if the growth of 
paediatric subjects develops at a slower rate than would be expected based on the growth chart of the 
local geographic area. In this case, further diagnostic evaluations can be considered to find the cause 
of growth failure.1
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
The incidence of short stature associated with GHD has been estimated to be approximately 1:4000 to 
1:10,0002,3 . GHD may be isolated or may be associated with deficiencies of other pituitary hormones.
Growth hormone deficiency is the primary indication for growth hormone treatment in childhood, which 
presently requires daily subcutaneous injections for the patient except for the recently registered 
Skytrofa and Ngenla, which are also administered once weekly. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis
There are different causes of growth hormone deficiency, which can be categorized in different 
categories, namely:
•
Congenital (organic causes such as pituitary aplasia, primary empty sella syndrome etc. or 
genetic causes including various mutations)
•
Acquired (tumours of the hypothalamic-pituitary region, most commonly craniopharyngioma, 
head trauma, infection etc.)
•
Idiopathic (no clear aetiology)
The aetiology of childhood GHD is usually hypothalamic in origin with impaired GHRH secretion, with 
the most common diagnosis being isolated idiopathic GHD (Cook 2009).

Page 10/96
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation and diagnosis 
In neonates, clinical presentations of congenital pituitary GHD include profound hypoglycemia, 
hypoglycemic seizures, prolonged jaundice, and microphallus and cryptorchidism in boys. The patients 
diagnosed at younger ages generally have more severe GHD, are more likely to suffer from multiple 
pituitary hormone deficiencies and tend to have more complications at birth. A substantial reduction in 
growth rate may become apparent within the first few months of life (Huet 1999, Ogilvy-Stuart 2003, 
Ranke 2003). This is sometimes associated with a delay in fontanelle closure.
Although the most obvious feature of GHD may be short stature, the disease has broad health 
implications. Children with GHD may have a small midface, hands, and feet, excess subcutaneous 
truncal fat, reduced muscle mass, thin hair and nails, a high-pitched voice, delayed skeletal and dental 
maturation, and delayed puberty (Albanese 1994, Levy 1996). In addition, GHD can influence cognitive 
functions and the overall sense of well-being. When accompanied by other pituitary deficiencies, 
further clinical manifestations may be present.
2.1.5.  Management
The typical symptom of GHD in children is growth failure, and consequently, the aim of treatment is to 
normalize the growth rate during childhood and attainment of normal adult height. 
With current treatment algorithms, paediatric recombinant human growth hormone doses are based on 
the body weight of the growing child. IGF-I plasma concentrations should be maintained in the normal 
age and sex-adjusted range for safety reasons. Periodic checks of IGF-I levels are required because 
they may change over time, even if the growth hormone dosage does not change.
While daily human growth hormone is safe and effective, its frequency of administration can be 
burdensome for both children and their caregivers. Although children with GHD treated with daily 
growth hormone replacement can achieve normal adult height, real-world outcomes have not matched 
expectations. Due to nonadherence rates ranging from 5 to 82% (Fisher 2013), most GHD patients do 
not reach their target genetic height (Guyda 1999, Lustig 2004), leaving an opportunity to improve 
treatment outcomes in paediatric GHD.
While there are multiple therapeutic goals of human growth hormone therapy in treating GHD, 
including achievement of normal growth patterns, lean/fat body composition, bone mass, glucose 
homeostasis, cognition and improved quality of life, the most readily measured indicator of efficacy is 
growth. Therefore, a therapy that results in improved growth outcomes at the end of 52 weeks of 
treatment is expected to result in better clinical effects with long-term therapy.
For paediatric GHD patients, medicinal products for daily (e.g. Omnitrope (EU/1/06/332), Nutropin Aq 
(EU/1/00/164)) or weekly (e.g. Ngenla (EU/1/21/1617), Skytrofa (EU/1/21/1607)) growth hormone 
supplementation are available. 
2.2.  About the product
Somapacitan is a long-acting recombinant human growth hormone derivative with a single substitution 
in the peptide backbone (leucine [L] at position 101 substituted with cysteine [C]) to which an albumin 
binding moiety has been attached. The albumin binding moiety (side-chain) consists of a C16 fatty acid 
moiety and a hydrophilic spacer attached to position 101 of the protein by chemical conjugation. The 
non-covalent, reversible binding to endogenous albumin delays the elimination of somapacitan and 
prolongs the in vivo half-life (t½ and duration of action). Similar techniques have previously been used 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of 
indication variation 
EMA/268297/2023 
Page 11/96
to prolong the half-life of insulin and GLP-1 molecules, such as Levemir, Victoza and Ozempic.
Somapacitan bound to albumin
The pharmacological effects of somapacitan are like those of human growth hormone. These include 
stimulation of somatic growth, especially skeletal and muscle growth and maintenance. In addition, 
human growth hormone has many other effects on the body including increasing lipolysis, protein 
synthesis, muscle mass, and gluconeogenesis in the liver, and reducing glucose uptake in the liver. As 
for human GH, the mechanism of action of somapacitan is either direct via the growth hormone 
receptor or indirect via stimulation of IGF-I expression and release.
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development
On 31 March 2021, Sogroya was approved by the European Commission for the replacement of 
endogenous growth hormone (GH) in adults with growth hormone deficiency (AGHD).
On 25 April 2022, the European Commission has approved an extension application to add a new 
strength of 5 mg/1.5 mL (3.3 mg/mL), for which a bioequivalence study was submitted.
The current application for Sogroya is an extension of the Marketing Authorisation to add a new 
strength of 15 mg/1.5 mL solution for injection in pre-filled pen, grouped with a type II variation for 
adding a therapeutic indication in paediatric patients, starting from 3 years of age.
2.4.  Quality aspects
2.4.1.  Introduction
Sogroya is a long-acting recombinant human growth hormone (hGH) derivative based on the active 
substance Somapacitan. It is intended for once-weekly subcutaneous injection by patients, caregivers 
and/or healthcare professionals. 
The finished product is presented as a solution for injection containing somapacitan as active 
substance. Other ingredients are: histidine, mannitol, poloxamer 188, phenol, water for injections, 
hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment) and sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment). 
The product is available in 1.5 mL glass cartridge (Type I colourless glass) with a plunger made of 
chlorobutyl rubber and a stopper made of bromobutyl/isoprene rubber sealed with an aluminium cap. 
The cartridge is contained in a multidose disposable pen made of polypropylene, polyacetal, 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of 
indication variation 
EMA/268297/2023 
Page 12/96
polycarbonate and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and in addition two metal springs. The cartridge is 
permanently sealed in a pen-injector. The finished product is available in pack sizes of 1 pre-filled pen 
and multipack of 5 (5 packs of 1) pre-filled pens.
The product is currently approved in 5 mg/1.5 mL (3.3 mg/mL) and 10 mg/1.5 mL (6.7 mg/mL) 
strengths with an in-use time of up to 6 weeks. This application is an extension of the marketing 
authorisation for Sogroya with the scope of introducing a new strength 15 mg/1.5 mL (10 mg/mL) 
solution for injection, (packsizes of 1 and 5 prefilled pens), grouped with a variation to add a new 
indication for the treatment of GHD in children and adolescents. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance
Changes to the active substance manufacture and control are not proposed in this application. CTD 
section 3.2.S.4. Control of Drug Substance, has been updated to include the updated validation reports 
of analytical methods common to active substance and finished product for the 15 mg strength.
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
The MAH has updated this section to include the new 15 mg strength. The content of active ingredient 
is the only difference in composition (see Table 1) between the different strengths of the finished 
product. This is clearly stated in the updated document, and acceptable.

All changes in the composition have been implemented prior to phase 3 clinical trials.
The formulation development work for the original MAA procedure of Sogroya was already performed 
with somapacitan finished product in a matrix covering finished product strengths from 5 mg to 15 mg 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of 
indication variation 
EMA/268297/2023 
Page 13/96
in a 1.5 ml cartridge. With regard to application of Sogroya for the paediatric population, the 
formulation is not changed and no direct safety issues are foreseen from the excipients used.
For the medical device (see figure 1-3 below) the description, comparison to other pens, test report for 
device performance requirements and shelf life data according to ISO are updated to encompass the 
15 mg strength. The associated Notified Body report is provided and assessed under regional 
Information. No changes are proposed for the primary container closure system. 
The pen-injectors are highly similar in all strengths, only differing in colour and dose delivered per dose 
step. The suitability of the 15 mg pen for the line extension is considered sufficiently justified. The 
suitability of the pens with regard to the new indication for the treatment of GHD in children was also 
sufficiently addressed.
The Summary of Human Factors validation has been updated to encompass the 15 mg strength and 
the inclusion of children in the evaluation of handling and differentiation. 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls
The existing description of the finished product manufacturing process is still adequate with the 
introduction of the 15 mg strength. 
The assembly flowchart with IPCs for the pen-injector was resubmitted with editorial changes to adapt 
the text to the inclusion of the 15 mg strength.
While the process validation submitted with procedure EMEA/H/C/005030/X/0001/G (addition of the 5 
mg strength) already included data on the 15 mg strength, the MAH has submitted a new document. 
The changes found are mainly editorial changes and some additional data on the 15 mg strength 
(Process time for bioburden and bacterial endotoxin). These new data do not give rise to concerns. 
Validation results of three 15mg full scale batches which were all used in clinical studies have been

submitted and results sufficiently support the commercial process for the new strength. The 
manufacturing process for the 15 mg strength is considered validated. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis
The finished product specification parameters and acceptance criteria are identical for the three 
strengths, except for the content that varies with finished product strength and related substances, for 
which the MAH has substantiated with data that the 15 mg strength has increased degradation over 
time and proposed a separate limit based on stability data at 5°C for up to 24 months. 
Analytical procedures and reference standards
The suitability of the compendial procedures for Somapacitan 15 mg has been verified, and brief 
summaries of the validation of the non-pharmacopoeial analytical procedures have been provided. For 
non-pharmacopoeial analytical procedures used for somapacitan finished product only, brief summaries 
are provided. The information provided confirms suitability of the analytical methods for the new 
strength.
Reference standards are not changed through this application.
Batch analysis
An updated document on batch analyses is provided with mainly editorial changes. New data are added 
for “somapacitan 10 mg, batch no CLDP013, phase 2 specification”. These data do not give rise to 
concern. All data on the 15 mg strength, comprising a total of 8 commercial scale batches of which 3 
produced at the current facility, were already submitted with procedure EMEA/H/C/005030/X/0001/G, 
but with Content reported ‘for information only’. In the current submission, the proposed acceptance 
criterium for content of the 15 mg strength is included. The data provided on the 15 mg strength 
confirm that the consistency of the product as shown for the 5 mg and 10 mg strength also applies to 
this new strength.
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product
The existing stability program as approved for the 5 mg and 10 mg strengths is extended to the 15 mg 
strength, which is acceptable. The stability commitment as provided for the 5 mg and 10 mg strength 
is updated to include three full scale (2x15 L and 1x 50L) batches of the 15 mg strength as well. 
Sufficient representative batches of the 15 mg strength (four for primary stability studies, three for full 
scale manufacturing validation stability at FF, three for in-use stability, and one for photostability) have 
been included and the proposed shelf life is covered.
Data resulting from long term, accelerated, in use and photostability studies are submitted. For related 
substances, the results of 15 mg strength reveal slightly more increase in product related substances 
than those of the other strengths (of which the 5 mg is also slightly less degraded than the 10 mg 
strength. Thus, this parameter seems to increase with product strength). The other results are broadly 
equivalent between the strengths. The results for related substances for the 15 mg strength still 
remain within the shelf life acceptance criteria as approved for the already marketed strengths. 
Based on the data, the shelf life of 24 months at 2-8 °C and in-use period of 6 weeks at 2-8 ºC 
including the possibility of storage at or below 30 ºC for a maximum of 72 hours (3 days) are justified 
and acceptable. It is also agreed that data from the photostability study show that all strengths of 
somapacitan finished product are photostable when stored in the pen-injector. Thus, the existing shelf 
life criteria can be maintained and extended to the new 15 mg strength.

2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents
There are no changes to previously submitted information in relation to adventitious agents.
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects
Based on the data provided, the chemical, biological and pharmaceutical quality of Sogroya 15 mg 
strength is generally satisfactory and comparable to the approved 5 mg and 10 mg strengths. The 
formulation of the 15 mg strength is identical to the other strengths except for the concentration of the 
active substance somapacitan. The integrated medical device, i.e. the pen-injector used for 
administration is highly similar between all strengths, only differing in colour and dose delivered per 
dose step. Based on batch release and stability data, especially regarding product-related impurities, 
the three strengths can be considered comparable.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC.
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects
No new non-clinical studies were conducted to support this line extension. Exposure multiples achieved 
in repeat dose toxicity studies remain sufficiently high to support the higher dose for this paediatric 
indication. Based on this, no new toxicological findings were noted that would be of clinical relevance. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects
The application is a line-extension grouped with an extension of indication and from a non-clinical point 
of view, the CHMP has considered that the pharmacology, safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and 
toxicological properties are considered known.
The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or 
distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, somapacitan is not expected to pose a risk 
to the environment.
2.5.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects
Overall, the toxicology programme revealed no novel findings that would be of relevance for this 
application. All information has been adequately addressed in the SmPC.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics
In paediatric patients with GHD, the recommended dose is 0.16 mg/kg once weekly in treatment-naïve 
patients and patients switching from other growth hormone products.
Three new clinical studies were conducted in paediatric patients with GHD to support the line-
extension. One was a single dose escalation study in non-naïve paediatric patients with GHD aged 6 to 
11 years versus active comparator Norditropin with full PK sampling. The second one was a multiple-
dose finding, efficacy and safety study in naïve paediatric patients with GHD (aged ≥2.5 years to ≤9 
years for girls and ≤10 years for boys) versus active comparator Norditropin with sparse PK sampling. 
A third one was a multiple-dose efficacy and study (≥2.5 years of age to <10 years for girls, <11 
years for boys) study in naïve paediatric patients with GHD versus active comparator Norditropin with 
sparse PK sampling. PopPK modelling was used to determine the PK in paediatric patients following 
repeated dosing. No PK studies were conducted in paediatric patients aged <2.5 years old and 
between 12 and <18 years.
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of 
indication variation 
EMA/268297/2023 
Page 18/96
The initial PopPK model from MAA was extended with the paediatric PK and PD data. Pen strength was 
not a pre-specified covariate but was investigated as a covariate (15 mg/1.5 mL versus 5-10 
mg/1.5 mL) in a post-hoc analysis based on the full model. 
Absorption 
During the initial marketing authorisation assessment, the Applicant showed that injection into thigh 
and abdomen had no effect om the PK of somapacitan. It is agreed that this is also most likely the 
case in paediatric patients. However, the Applicant also included the injection sites upper arm and 
buttocks. In the paediatric patient studies the injection site for each individual dosing occasion was not 
registered and therefore it cannot be investigated if injection into upper arm and buttocks leads to 
similar PK as injection into thigh and abdomen. However, it is not considered that this needs to be 
investigated further.
Distribution
The PopPK model (incorporating rate-limiting absorption) estimated a volume of distribution of 14.6 L 
in adults, which would be in line with the volume of distribution of albumin (13.6 L). The paediatric 
model predicted a V/F at steady state of 1.73 L.
Elimination
No differences in metabolism and excretion are expected between paediatric and adult patients.
In adults, there was no indication of increased risk of anti-somapacitan/anti-GH antibody development 
for somapacitan compared to somatropin. No comparison was provided for paediatrics. Fifteen to 22% 
of the paediatric patients tested positive for anti-drug antibodies, but none had neutralising anti-drug 
antibodies. The formation of anti-somapacitan antibodies in paediatric patients did not appear to affect 
PD, efficacy or adverse events reported.
Dose proportionality and time dependencies
In paediatric patients with GHD, a non-linear dose-exposure relationship with a greater than dose-
proportional increase in exposure was observed. This was in accordance with the non-linearity 
observed in adult patients with GHD and healthy adults. Steady-state occurred after 1−2 doses 
following treatment initiation and low accumulation was seen (Racc of 1.06). This was similar to that 
observed in adult patients with GHD.
Special populations
Overall, body weight, gender and race did not clinically affect somapacitan PK in children with GHD 
following weight-based dosing.
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies
No specific DDI studies were conducted at the time of the initial marketing authorisation. This is 
acceptable considering the similarity of somapacitan with growth hormone. The drug-drug interaction 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of 
indication variation 
EMA/268297/2023 
Page 19/96
potential is expected to be similar to other marketed growth hormone products and no additional DDI 
studies are warranted since no additional DDIs are expected in children.
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics
Mechanism of action
The mechanism of action of somapacitan is either directly via the GH-receptor and/or indirectly via 
IGF-I produced in tissues throughout the body, but predominantly by the liver.
Primary and Secondary pharmacology
Pharmacodynamic endpoints
In the somapacitan development programme, circulating IGF-I was used as biomarker to assess the 
pharmacodynamic properties of somapacitan. Standard deviation score (SDS) data were derived for 
IGF-I. The SDS reflects the number of standard deviations below or above a reference population 
mean and allows for comparison of IGF-I data across the study population.
More than 90% of IGF-I is bound to insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs), primarily 
IGFBP-3.4 Because of this, IGFBP-3 was used as a supportive biomarker to evaluate somapacitan 
pharmacodynamics.
IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were determined in central laboratories.
To be more specific, the pharmacodynamic properties of somapacitan were evaluated using 
pharmacodynamic parameters based on concentration–time profiles for IGF-I and IGFBP-3. 
In addition, the IGF-I data collected in phase 2 and 3 studies in children with GHD (study 4172 and 
4263) were used to estimate pharmacodynamic parameters based on modelling analyses (see 
population PK/PD modelling above). Finally, exposure-response analyses were conducted.
Pharmacodynamic evaluations
In the clinical pharmacology trial 4042, the pharmacodynamics (as measured by IGF-I and IGFBP-3) of 
somapacitan following single dose exposure was investigated in children with GHD. The single doses 
ranged from 0.02 to 0.16 mg/kg. The pharmacodynamic results for IGF-I are summarised in Table 3.

Multiple doses of once-weekly somapacitan (0.04, 0.08, and 0.16 mg/kg/week), and once daily 
somatropin medicinal product (0.034 mg/kg/day (total 0.24 mg/kg per week)) were administered to 
paediatric GHD patients in study 4172. During a follow-up period of one year, IGF-I SDS and mean 
IGF-I SDS levels increased in a dose-dependent manner with increasing somapacitan dose. 
Somapacitan at a dosage of 0.16 mg/kg/week was considered the most appropriate starting dosage, 
taking into account IGF-I SDS levels, but also growth parameters, safety, and tolerability. This 
somapacitan dosage was subsequently evaluated in Phase 3 study 4263.
Steady state pharmacodynamics
The steady-state pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of somapacitan were evaluated by population 
PK/PD modelling analyses based on sparse PK/PD sampling from study 4172 (Phase 2) and study 4263 
(Phase 3). The evaluation of the steady state pharmacodynamic properties of somapacitan for the 0.16 
mg/kg/week dose level focused on parameters estimated from the combined data obtained in studies 
4172 and 4263.
The steady-state model-estimated IGF-I SDS profile for somapacitan 0.16 mg/kg/week in studies 4172 
and 4263 indicated that somapacitan is suitable for once-weekly dosing. Steady-state occurred after 
1−2 doses following treatment initiation in children with GHD.
Mean IGF-Iavg SDS for somapacitan 0.16 mg/kg/week was 0.53 [90% CI -0.83; 1.64] range for 
studies 4172 and 4263 combined. The mean time to maximum IGF-I levels at steady state (IGF-I 
Tmax) was 57.6 hours.
Steady-state occurred after 1−2 doses following treatment initiation. After treatment discontinuation, 
IGF-I levels reached baseline levels 1-2 weeks after the last dose.
IGF-I monitoring
The difference between estimated average IGF-I SDS and steady-state IGF-I SDS levels at different 
times after dose are illustrated in Figure 4.

Formulas for calculation of average IGF-I SDS based on samples taken in specified time intervals over 
the somapacitan dosing interval are provided in Table 6. Sampling 2 days after the injection provides a 
value that closely approximates the expected maximum IGF-I SDS value, whereas the average IGF-I 
SDS over the weekly dosing interval is most closely approximated with a sample taken 4 days after 
injection. The weekly average IGF-I SDS can be calculated based on blood samples taken on any day 
of the week following somapacitan injection. Sampling for IGF-I measurements within the first 24 
hours after dosing is not advised.

IGFBP-3
IGFBP-3 was used as a supportive biomarker to assess somapacitan pharmacodynamics in study 4042. 
A dose-dependent increase was observed in IGFBP-3 following somapacitan dose administration. 
Results for IGFBP-3 overall supported the findings for IGF-I. 
Pharmacodynamics over time
To evaluate IGF-I levels over time, IGF-Iavg SDS was estimated by treatment year over the duration 
of study 4172 (4 years) and study 4263 (1 year) for the somapacitan 0.16 mg/kg/week dose level. 
IGF-Iavg SDS levels were overall similar over the 4-year treatment period.
Flexibility in dosing and change of dosing day
Simulations of PK and IGF-I SDS profiles were used to assess the impact of allowing flexibility in the 
weekly dosing regimen of somapacitan or change of the weekly dosing day, while maintaining a 
minimum of 4 days (96 hours) in between doses.
On occasions when administration at the scheduled dosing day is not possible, somapacitan can be 
taken up to 2 days before or 3 days after the scheduled weekly dosing day as long as the time 
between two doses is at least 4 days. The impact on the IGF-I SDS profile of allowing dosing two days 
prior to or three days after the regular dosing day and then proceeding with weekly dosing on the 
regular dosing day is shown in Figure 5.

The day of the weekly injection can be changed as long as the time between two doses is at least 4 
days. The impact of changing the regular dosing day by dosing three days earlier or by postponing a 
dose for three days is shown in Figure 6.
In all cases, the impact on PK and IGF-I SDS was limited, and steady-state occurred 1-2 doses after 
regular weekly treatment was resumed.

Missed dosing
A missed dose of somapacitan can be administered up to 3 days after the regular dosing day with 
limited impact on the somapacitan IGF-I SDS profile (Figure 5 and Figure 6). If more than three days 
have passed, the dose should be skipped and dosing should be resumed on the regular dosing day in 
the following week, as illustrated in Figure 7. A steady-state occurred 1-2 doses after the regular 
weekly treatment regimen was resumed.

Comparison to somatropin medicinal product Norditropin
The clinical pharmacology study 4042 and the phase 2 and 3 studies (studies 4172 and 4263) included 
somatropin medicinal product Norditropin as an active comparator. The somatropin dose was 0.034 
mg/kg/day in studies 4172 and 4263, corresponding to the highest approved somatropin dose for 
children with GHD. In study 4042, a somatropin dose of 0.03 mg/kg was selected as representing a 
dose within the recommended dose range for human growth hormone (hGH) treatment of children with 
GHD.
IGF-I SDS levels following treatment with somapacitan 0.16 mg/kg/week and somatropin were
compared based on observed and model-estimated data from studies 4042, 4172 and 4263.
In study 4042, IGF-I levels for somapacitan and somatropin were compared in an exploratory 
statistical analysis for IGF-I AUC0-168h and Cmax. The results of this analysis are provided in Table 7 
for the somapacitan 0.16 mg/kg dose level. There was no statistically significant difference in AUC0-
168h for somapacitan 0.16 mg/kg and somatropin 0.03 mg/kg, but Cmax was significantly higher for 
somapacitan 0.16 mg/kg compared to somatropin, indicating a higher variation over the weekly dosing 
interval for once-weekly somapacitan compared to daily somatropin.

Switching from daily GH treatment to once-weekly somapacitan
Patients switching from daily hGH to once-weekly somapacitan should take the final dose of daily 
treatment the day before (or at least 8 hours before) taking the first dose of once-weekly somapacitan. 
The IGF-I SDS profile when switching from daily GH (somapacitan medicinal product Norditropin 0.034 
mg/kg/day which is equivalent to a total weekly dose of 0.24 mg/kg/week) to once-weekly 
somapacitan (0.16 mg/kg/week) 8 hours after the latest dose of daily GH is shown in Figure 8. Steady-
state is expected to occur after the second somapacitan dose.

Secondary pharmacology
No data on secondary pharmacology in paediatric GHD patients were submitted.
Genetic differences in PD response
Effects of intrinsic factors on somapacitan PK and PD properties
The potential impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of 
somapacitan was addressed using modelling analyses based on data from clinical pharmacology study 
4042, study 4172 (Phase 2) and study 4263 (Phase 3) in children with GHD. The factors evaluated 
were: body weight, sex, and race. Age was not investigated as a separate intrinsic factor, as age and 
body weight are strongly correlated in children.
Body weight was the only significant covariate on PK in children with GHD (Figure 9). The results of the 
modelling analysis for somapacitan PK are visualised as exposure for each covariate category relative 
to the exposure of a reference subject’s profile in Figure 9. The effects of body weight, sex and race on 
the IGF-I response, as evaluated by the change from baseline IGF-Iavg SDS, were relatively small 
(≤0.5 SDS) or not significant.
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of 
indication variation 
EMA/268297/2023 
Page 26/96
Based on population PK/PD modelling, body weight, sex and race did not have a clinically meaningful 
effect on somapacitan PK and IGF-I response in children with GHD following weight-based dosing. 
Somapacitan PK and PD were also compared between healthy adult Japanese subjects and healthy 
adult non-Asian subjects in study 3915, which was included in the initial application in AGHD. 
Somapacitan exposure (AUC0-168h and Cmax) and IGF-I response (AUC0-168h and Cmax) were similar 
between Japanese and non-Asian subjects at the same dose per kg in study 3915.

Effects of extrinsic factors on somapacitan PK and PD properties
No investigation of extrinsic factors was performed in children with GHD. Potential drug-drug 
interactions for somapacitan were evaluated in the initial application for patients with AGHD.
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology
Pharmacokinetics
Three new clinical studies were conducted in paediatric patients with GHD aged ≥2.5 years up to 11 
years to support the line-extension. No PK studies were conducted in paediatric patients aged <2.5 
years and 12 to <18 years. 
Somapacitan pen injectors with 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg in 1.5 ml were used in the confirmatory Phase 
3 study 4263 and in the Phase 2 study 4172. Based on the exposure and IGF-I response (PopPK 
modelling) and considering that the excipients are similar, no difference in exposure is expected when 
using the different pen strengths. Hence, a somapacitan dose strength of 15 mg somapacitan per 1.5 
ml solution is acceptable.
One single dose escalation (0.02, 0.04, 0.08 and 0.16 mg/kg) study was conducted with full PK 
sampling. In addition, two multiple dose (0.04, 0.08 and 0.16 mg/kg/week) studies were conducted 
with sparse PK sampling. PopPK modelling was used to determine the PK in paediatric patients 
following repeated dosing.  The exposure in paediatric patients with growth hormone deficiency is 
higher at a similar dose compared to adult patients with growth hormone deficiency. At a dose of 0.08 
mg/kg/week, the Cmax is 125 ng/mL (CV%=67) in paediatric patients and 45.4 ng/mL (CV%=128) in 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of 
indication variation 
EMA/268297/2023 
Page 28/96
 
adult patients with growth hormone deficiency. The AUC is 4367 ng × h/mL (CV%=50) in paediatric 
patients and 2085 ng × h/mL (CV%=102) in adult patients at a dose of 0.08 mg/kg/week. At a dose of 
0.04 mg/kg/week, the Cmax is 34.7 ng/mL (CV%=48) in paediatric patients and 20.6 ng/mL 
(CV%=201) in adult patients with growth hormone deficiency. The AUC is 1313 ng × h/mL (CV%=24) 
in paediatric patients and 986 ng × h/mL (CV%=93) in adult patients at a dose of 0.08 mg/kg/week. 
Higher levels of growth hormone are needed in children to normalise IGF-I levels and induce normal 
longitudinal growth. The difference in exposure between children and adults treated with growth 
hormone is also seen in populations treated with daily growth hormone. Therefore, the higher 
exposure in paediatric patients compared to adult patients with growth hormone deficiency is 
acceptable at a similar dose.
Pharmacodynamics
Somapacitan acts similar to the endogenous growth hormone, and the well-known effects are either 
direct (for example, on the fat tissue or growth in children) of indirect (for example, increase in muscle 
mass). The primary pharmacodynamic effect is an increase in IGF-1, IGFBP3 and acid-labile subunit 
levels. The most important secondary pharmacologic effects (i.e. IGF-I mediated) are elevations of 
fasting glucose and insulin concentrations.
The steady-state model-estimated IGF-I SDS profile for somapacitan 0.16 mg/kg/week indicated that 
IGF-I SDS levels increased up 2-3 days after somapacitan administration in paediatric GHD patients. 
Thereafter, IGF-I SDS levels decreased during days 4-7. A steady state occurred after 1-2 once-weekly 
somapacitan administration. 
In the first year of treatment, the observed IGF-I responses tended to be higher with increasing 
somapacitan dosages in paediatric GHD patients. Moreover, the height velocity and the results for 
supportive efficacy endpoints tended to be larger for increasing changes from baseline IGF-Iavg SDS. 
Hence, there is a positive dose-response relationship for somapacitan treatment. Model-derived change 
from baseline average IGF-I SDS for somapacitan was similar to the observed change from baseline 
IGF-I SDS for somatropin at week 52 in the pivotal Phase 3 study 4263. The applicant showed later 
that similar results were obtained upon comparison of observed IGF-I SDS levels for somapacitan and 
somatropin.
It was shown that the average IGF-I SDS levels remained similar during 4 consecutive periods of one 
year upon somapacitan dosing of 0.16 mg/kg/week in conducted clinical studies.
The effects of body weight, gender and race on the IGF-I response, as evaluated by the change from 
baseline IGF-Iavg SDS, were relatively small (≤0.5 SDS) or not significant.
The day of weekly injection can be changed as long as the time between two doses is at least 4 days. 
If somapacitan administration at the scheduled dosing day is not possible, somapacitan can be taken 
up to 2 days before or 3 days after the scheduled weekly dosing day as long as the time between two 
doses is at least 4 days. Steady-state will recur 1-2 doses after regular weekly somapacitan treatment.
According to the proposed SmPC, patients switching from daily somatropin to once-weekly 
somapacitan should take the final dose of somatropin the day before (or at least 8 hours before) taking 
the first dose of once-weekly somapacitan.
A considerable proportion of study patients had IGF-I levels above +2 SDS during some time in clinical 
studies 4172 and 4263, especially within the first 3 days after somapacitan administration. In adult 
GHD patients, short intervals of IGF-I levels above +2 SDS were not associated with increased safety 
risks of somapacitan. The applicant later indicated that this also applies to paediatric GHD patients.
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of 
indication variation 
EMA/268297/2023 
Page 29/96
At a somapacitan starting dosage of 0.16 mg/kg/week, IGF-I SDS levels within the range of -2 and +2 
were obtained in paediatric GHD patients of different gender and pubertal status. Hence, a 
somapacitan starting dosage of 0.16 mg/kg/week is appropriate for the subgroups of paediatric GHD 
patients (i.e. pre-pubertal, and post-pubertal), male pubertal GHD patients, and female pubertal GHD 
patients with or without concomitant oestrogen use.
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology
The PK was investigated in paediatric patients with GHD aged ≥2.5 to 11 years. No PK studies were 
performed in paediatric patients aged <2.5 years and 12 to <18 years. The pharmacokinetic profile of 
somapacitan 15 mg in 1.5 ml solution is in line with that of the authorized dose strengths of 5 and 10 
mg somapacitan in 1.5 ml solution.
Submitted data support the pharmacodynamic effects of somapacitan in paediatric GHD patients. A 
positive dose-response relationship for somapacitan treatment in these patients was observed.
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy
2.6.5.1.  Dose response study
Study NN8640-4172, further abbreviated into study 4172, and also indicated as REAL 3, is a 
randomised, multinational, active-controlled, dose-finding, parallel-group study investigating efficacy 
and safety of once-weekly somapacitan treatment compared to daily GH treatment (somatropin 
medicinal product Norditropin) in GH treatment-naïve, pre-pubertal children with GHD (Figure 11). 
Main study plus extension
Fifty- nine (59) study patients were randomised (1:1:1:1) to either somapacitan (0.04, 0.08 or 0.16 
mg/kg/week) or somatropin (0.034 mg/kg/day i.e. a total weekly dose of 0.24 mg/kg) during a 26-
week main period and a 26-week extension period (completed). In the main period, treatment was 
double-blinded between the three somapacitan cohorts and open-label between the somapacitan 
cohorts and the somatropin cohort. 
Safety extension
The initial 52 weeks were followed by 104-weeks open-label safety extension period (completed). In 
this period, all patients who were initially treated with different dosages of somapacitan were treated 
with somapacitan at a dosage of 0.16 mg/kg/week. Study patients who were initially randomized to 
0.034 mg/kg/week somatropin continued this treatment in the 104-week safety extension period. 
Long-term safety extension
The safety extension period was followed by a 208-week ongoing long-term safety extension in which 
all study patients were treated with somapacitan at a dosage of 0.16 mg/kg/week. 
Two new cohorts were added in the long-term safety extension period of the study to collect data on 
children in age groups not included in cohort I of study 4172 or in the Phase 3 study 4263, namely 
cohort II: children under 2.5 years, and cohort III: children above 9 years (girls) / 10 years (boys) at 
enrolment. All study patients in these new cohorts were treated with somapacitan at a dosage of 0.16 
mg/kg/week.

Study participants
Growth hormone treatment-naïve paediatric patients aged 2.5 years and older at Tanner stage I with a 
confirmed diagnosis of GHD diagnosis of GHD within 12 months prior to screening defined as a peak 
growth hormone level of ≤7.0 ng/ml, and exclusion of other diagnoses were included in study 4172.
Treatments
Somapacitan 0.04, 0.08 or 0.16 mg/kg/week
Somatropin medicinal product Norditropin 0.034 mg/kg/day 
Study patients in study 4172 were randomised to either somatropin (0.034 mg/kg/day i.e. a total 
weekly dose of 0.24 mg/kg) or one of three somapacitan doses (0.04/0.08/0.16 mg/kg/week) from 
baseline to week 52. From week 52 and for the remaining duration of the study, all study patients 
allocated to somapacitan were administered 0.16 mg/kg/week. The study patients allocated to 
somatropin were switched to somapacitan (0.16 mg/kg/week) at week 156 for the remaining duration 
of the study. 
Dose reduction in consecutive steps of 25% of the current dose could be considered at the 
investigator’s discretion, for adverse events judged as probably related to the study medicinal product 
by the investigator. If the adverse event persisted, the study patient could be discontinued and if the 
adverse event resolved, the dose could then be resumed to the original planned dose at the 
investigator’s discretion.
Objective 
The objectives of cohort I were to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and the impact of study treatment on 
well-being, psychosocial functioning, treatment satisfaction and preference in growth hormone 
treatment in growth hormone treatment naïve pre-pubertal children with GHD primarily after 26 weeks 
of treatment, up to 364 weeks of treatment.
The objective of cohorts II and III was to evaluate the safety of once-weekly somapacitan during at 
least 13 weeks and up to 208 weeks of treatment in children with GHD.
Randomisation and blinding
Study patients were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 (0.04 mg/kg/week somapacitan; 0.08 mg/kg/week 
somapacitan; 0.16 mg/kg/week somapacitan; 0.034 mg/kg/day (i.e. a total weekly dose of 0.24 
mg/kg) somatropin) manner with a block size of four to receive either somapacitan or somatropin 
medicinal product Norditropin. The randomisation was stratified by region (Japan versus the rest of the 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of 
indication variation 
EMA/268297/2023 
Page 31/96
world). The randomisation within the rest of the world region was additionally stratified by gender 
(boys versus girls) and age (<6 versus > 6 years) to minimize the bias of these two parameters on the 
primary endpoint. A study-specific interactive web response system was used, which could be accessed 
at any time via the internet or telephone. 
The main study period (26 weeks) was double-blinded with regard to different dose levels of once- 
weekly somapacitan but open-labelled with regard to daily somatropin as the active control arm. 
After the double-blinding of the main study period, the sponsor was unblinded, while the study patients 
and site staff remained blinded with regards to somapacitan dose level allocation until the end of the 
extension study period (week 52). The rest of the study was open-label as only one dose of 
somapacitan (0.16 mg/kg/week) was used. The study was observer-blinded with regards to the 
primary endpoint, i.e., the person performing the height measurements was blinded to treatment 
allocation.
Two additional cohorts were added to the study (after 156 weeks of treatment for cohort I) 
accordingly; study patients are currently being enrolled to receive unblinded somapacitan 0.16 
mg/kg/week for 13 weeks minimum in Cohort II: children with GHD of age <2.5 years and Cohort III: 
children with GHD of age 9-17 (girls) and 10-17 (boys).

trough (dosing day before dosing) and week 26 and week 52 assessments were taken at IGF-I SDS peak (day 1-4 after 
dosing). The observed IGF-I SDS levels and the modelled IGF-Iavg SDS levels, which account for the weekly IGF-I SDS 
profile were analyzed.
Notes: Secondary endpoints were not tested.
Statistical methods 
Sample size
Fifteen subjects randomised per treatment arm should assure 87% power for getting a 95% confidence 
interval for the estimated treatment difference that lies completely above -3.8 (the chosen delta value) 
when comparing a somapacitan treatment arm (0.04 mg/kg, 0.0 8mg/kg, 0.16 mg/kg) to the 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of 
indication variation 
EMA/268297/2023 
Page 32/96
somatropin treatment arm, given that the two treatments are equal, and expecting at most 7% 
dropout during the trial. The sample size calculation was based on an assumption of a standard 
deviation of 3.1 cm/year for height velocity after 26 weeks of treatment and the use of a delta value of 
-3.8 cm/year and a one-sided significance level of 2.5%. 
Definition of analysis sets
The following analysis sets were defined in the protocol:
Full analysis set (FAS): all randomised study patients who received at least one dose of randomised 
treatment. Subjects were analysed “as treated”.
Per protocol (PP) analysis set: study patients from the FAS, who had not violated any 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and who had used the randomised treatment for at least 22 weeks (for 
study patients receiving somapacitan) or 154 days (for study patients receiving somatropin) during the 
main study period. 
Safety analysis set (SAS): all randomised study patients were exposed to at least one dose of 
randomised treatment. Study patients were analysed “as treated”.
Analyses of cohorts II and III for study 4172 included all study patients who received at least one dose 
of somapacitan 0.16 mg/kg/week.
Analysis of primary endpoint height velocity
The primary endpoint for cohort I was height velocity (HV)(cm/year) during the first 26 weeks of 
treatment. Annualized height velocity after 26 weeks was analysed using a MMRM with treatment, age 
group, gender, region and sex by age group interaction term as factors and height at baseline as a 
covariate, all nested within week as a factor. From the MMRM, the treatment differences at week 26 
between somapacitan treatment arms and somatropin was estimated with the corresponding 95% CI. 
The primary analysis of the primary endpoint was based on the FAS. The analysis was repeated on the 
PP analysis set as a sensitivity analysis. 
The height velocity analysis was repeated at week 52 as a secondary, supportive endpoint, while 
height velocity at 104 weeks and 156 weeks was analysed using post-hoc statistical analysis. From 208 
weeks, height velocity was described using descriptive statistics.
Analysis of secondary endpoints
The secondary efficacy endpoints: were the change in HSDS, HVSDS, IGF-I SDS, IGFBP-3 SDS and 
TRIM-CGHD-O from baseline and the two TB-CGHD PROs at week 52 analysed using an MMRM similar 
to the MMRM used for the primary endpoint, but with the specific baseline assessment as covariate. 
The analyses were based on assessments from week 13, 26, 39 and 52 (26 and 52 for the PRO based 
endpoints). Somapacitan and hGH serum concentrations during the trial, PPQ assessment at week 160, 
as well as bone age progression versus chronological age up to week 208 were analysed using 
descriptive statistics.
For assessments up to and including week 52, analyses were done between all three somapacitan dose 
groups (0.04, 0.08 and 0.16 mg/kg/week) and somatropin (0.034 mg/kg/day). Subsequent analyses 
of all secondary efficacy endpoints (after week 52) were performed using descriptive statistics. 
Secondary endpoints were not included in any kind of test hierarchy and no adjustment for multiplicity 
was performed.

For cohort I, 86 Children were screened. Fifty-nine (59; 100%) study patients were randomised and 
exposed to treatment in the originally planned cohort I. Two (2) study patients (somapacitan 0.04 
mg/kg/week) were excluded from the FAS as they were randomised in error (violation of 
inclusion/exclusion criteria) and discontinued treatment prior to visit 3 (week 4). Fifty (50) study 
patients were exposed in the long-term safety extension study period following week 156 and 
completed treatment up to week 208.
Nine (9) children discontinued the study product before week 156, 6 in the somapacitan treatment 
arms (0.04/0.16 mg/kg/week: 4 children; 0.08/0.16 mg/kg/week: 1 child; 0.16/0.16 mg/kg/week: 1 
child) and 3 in the somatropin treatment arm. Of the 9 children discontinuing study treatment, 2 
discontinued treatment due to adverse events (nephrotic syndrome and drug hypersensitivity), 2 were 
withdrawn from treatment by parent/legally authorized representative and 5 discontinued treatment 
due to protocol violations.
Adherence was above 90% in all treatment groups in cohort I up to week 208 for study patients on 
treatment.
In cohorts II and III, a total of 10 study patients had been exposed to somapacitan (0.16 mg/kg/week) 
by the initial cut-off date of 26-Aug-2021 (recruitment still ongoing). None of the study patients in 
cohorts II or III had discontinued treatment at the cut-off date of 26-Aug-2021.

Baseline data
Study patients enrolled in cohort I of the supportive study 4172 were human growth hormone 
treatment naïve GHD diagnosed pre-pubertal children (≥2.5 years of age and <9 years for girls, <10 
years for boys). The GHD cause was either organic (7%) or unknown/idiopathic (93%).
Of the 57 study patients in cohort I (FAS), 31 (54.4%) were below the age of 6 years. 23 (40.4%) of 
the study patients were female. The study was conducted globally; most study patients were enrolled 
from India (24.6%), Japan (21.1.%), United States (14.0%) and Ukraine (12.3%). 
Cohort II included 1 child who was 2 years and 5 months (the age was rounded to 2.5 years in the 
output tables). Cohort III included 2 treatment naïve children (2 boys with age 11.9 years and 15.7 
years) and 7 previously treated children (6 boys and 1 girl; mean age: 13.27 years; min: 10.2 years; 
max: 16.1 years). The cause of GHD was idiopathic for 8 children and organic for 1 child. 
In cohort III, the 2 treatment naïve children had entered puberty (Tanner stage > 1) and among the 7 
previously treated children, 5 were prepubertal and 2 had entered puberty at screening.
Outcomes and estimation
Primary endpoint height velocity (annualised) 
The primary endpoint in study 4172 was height velocity (annualised) from baseline to week 26. A 
dose-response relationship was observed for somapacitan groups at three different dose levels (0.04, 
0.08 and 0.16 mg/kg/week) after both 26 and 52 weeks (Table 10). Height velocity at week 26 
numerically favoured somapacitan 0.16 mg/kg/week compared to somatropin 0.034 mg/kg/day 
(estimated treatment difference (ETD) = 1.67 cm/year [95% CI -0.22; 3.56]).

After week 52, study patients switching to somapacitan 0.16 mg/kg/week from the lower doses 
showed catch-up in height velocity, and at week 156, the observed height velocity was overall similar 
between the three individual somapacitan cohorts. No relevant differences in growth parameters were

observed from week 156-208 between the 39 study patients who received somapacitan since week 0 
compared to the 11 study patients switching from somatropin to somapacitan at week 156. 
In cohort II and Cohort III, Improvements in all height-based outcomes were observed in the 
treatment naïve study patients of cohort III (age above 9 years (girls) / 10 years (boys) at enrolment). 
Height based measure effects were maintained in the previously treated study patients in cohort II 
(age below 2½ years) and cohort III. 
Height velocity, HVSDS and HSDS
In cohort I, overall, the values of HV, HSDS and HVSDS increased from baseline to 26 and 52 weeks 
for all 4 treatment groups (Table 11). A dose-response relationship in the point estimates (and 
observed values) was generally seen within the somapacitan dose groups after both 26 and 52 weeks 
for all three height-based endpoints, HV, HVSDS, and HSDS.
The estimates for change from baseline in HVSDS at week 52 did not show nominal statistical 
significance for either of the two highest doses of somapacitan relative to somatropin (0.16 
mg/kg/week: estimated treatment difference= 1.64 [95% CI -0.02; 3.31]; 0.08 mg/kg/week: 
estimated treatment difference = 0.55 [95% CI -1.18; 2.29]). The difference between somapacitan 
0.04 mg/kg/week and somatropin was in favour of somatropin (estimated treatment difference = -
2.34 [95% CI -4.01; -0.67]).
At week 52, the HSDS change from baseline was higher for somapacitan 0.16mg/kg/week than 
somatropin (estimated treatment difference = 0.35 [95% CI 0.05; 0.65]). There was no difference 
between somapacitan 0.08 mg/kg/week and somatropin (estimated treatment difference = -0.10 
[95% CI - 0.39; 0.20]). The difference between somapacitan 0.04 mg/kg/week and somatropin was in 
favour of somatropin (estimated treatment difference = -0.58 [95% CI -0.88; -0.28]).

The obtained efficacy measures for height velocity, HVSDS, and HSDS were largely maintained after 
104, 156 and 208 weeks. At 156 weeks, the observed mean (SD) height velocity was 8.4 (1.7) 
cm/year for 0.16 mg/kg/week somapacitan and 7.6 (2.0) cm/year for somatropin, with similar 
increases in both groups from the baseline values of 3.8 (1.5) cm/year and 3.5 (1.6) cm/year, 
respectively. Observed mean (SD) changes from baseline in HSDS at week 156 were also similar with 
values of 2.67 (1.42) for 0.16 mg/kg/week somapacitan and 2.10 (0.85) for somatropin. Height gains 
achieved with somatropin were maintained after switching to somapacitan.

The baseline bone age/chronological age ratio was low and similar across all 4 treatment arms and 
increased moderately throughout all 208 weeks of the study to mean levels staying below 1. None of 
the study patients in cohort I reached near adult height during 208 weeks of study treatment.
In the previously treated subjects in cohort II and III, treatment effects in terms of the height based 
parameters (height velocity, HSDS, HVSDS) were maintained and in treatment naïve subjects. 
Increases in all height-based parameters were observed.
IGF-I SDS and IGFBP-3 SDS
In cohort I, baseline values for IGF-I SDS were similar for all doses of somapacitan and somatropin 
(ranging from -2.53 to -2.04). The mean IGF-I SDS remained below +2 from baseline up to week 208 
in all treatment groups. 
Dose-dependent increases in IGF-I SDS were observed for somapacitan up to week 52 with observed 
changes from baseline to week 52 of +0.98, +2.05 and +3.29 for somapacitan 0.04, 0.08 and 0.16 
mg/kg/week, respectively. The observed changes from baseline at week 52 tended to be larger for 
somapacitan 0.16 mg/kg/week (+3.29) as compared to somatropin 0.034 mg/kg/day (+1.67). Similar 
trends were observed at week 104 and week 156. In line with these data, IGF-I SDS levels > 2 (peak 
and trough levels) tended to be observed more frequently among study patients who were treated with 
somapacitan at a dosage of 0.16 mg/kg/week (0-35.7% at different visits) compared to those who 
were treated with somapacitan at a dosage of 0.08 mg/kg/week (0% at different visits) during an 
observation period of one year.
Model-derived average IGF-I SDS levels for somapacitan dosages of 0.08 and 0.16 mg/kg/week at 
week 52 in study 4172 are presented in Table 10.

The results for IGFBP-3 SDS showed the same tendencies as IGF-I SDS. 
No relevant differences in neither IGF-I SDS nor IGFBP-3 SDS were observed from week 156-208 
between the 39 study patients who received somapacitan since week 0 compared to the 11 study 
patients switching from somatropin to somapacitan at week 156.
In the treatment naïve study patients of cohort III, increases were observed in both pharmacodynamic 
endpoints, IGF-I SDS and IGFBP-3 SDS. IGF-I SDS levels remained in the normal range in these study 
patients. In the previously treated study patients in cohort II and III, the aforementioned parameters 
were maintained.
Patient reported outcomes
In cohort I, TRIM-CGHD-O, TB-CGHD-O and TB-CGHD-P all showed point estimates that tended to be 
larger for the highest dose of somapacitan (0.16 mg/kg/week) compared to somatropin up to week 
156.

indication variation

Page 38/96
From 156 to 208 weeks, the TB-CGHD questionnaires showed a tendency of reduced treatment burden 
in the study patients switching from somatropin to somapacitan at week 156 for both study patients 
and parents, as compared to the study patients who remained on somapacitan treatment.
Study patients switching from somatropin to somapacitan at week 156 and study patients remaining 
on somapacitan were observed to have a similar reduction in disease burden from week 156 to 208 as 
measured by the TRIM-CGHD-O. 
Data from the growth hormone preference questionnaire, GH-PPQ, showed that the majority (9 of 11) 
of the respondents had a strong or very strong preference for the once-weekly (somapacitan) over the 
daily (somatropin) treatment regimen. The main reasons listed included: less perceived physical pain, 
and emotional distress for the child.
PROs were not implemented for cohorts II or III.

Study NN8640-4263: A study comparing the effect and safety of once-weekly 
dosing of somapacitan with daily somatropin in children with growth hormone 
deficiency (REAL 4)
Methods
The Phase 3 study NN8640-4263, further abbreviated into study 4263, is a randomized open-labelled 
two arm study designed to compare the efficacy and safety of once-weekly dosing of somapacitan with 
daily dosing of somatropin after 52 weeks in children with GHD, followed by a 3-year single-arm 
extension period with once weekly dosing of somapacitan to evaluate safety. For efficacy, the specific 
purpose of the study was to confirm the non-inferiority of somapacitan relative to somatropin 
medicinal product Norditropin after 52 weeks of treatment.
Two hundred (200) study patients were randomised in a 2:1 manner to receive either somapacitan or 
somatropin medicinal product Norditropin during the main 52-week period. Fixed doses of somapacitan 
(0.16 mg/kg/week) and somatropin (0.034 mg/kg/day) were used throughout the first 52 weeks. After 
the 52-week main period, all study patients in the somatropin group were switched to somapacitan 
treatment (0.16 mg/kg/week), while all study patients in the somapacitan group continued their once-
weekly treatment. The safety extension period is currently ongoing.

Treatments
Somapacitan consisted of a fixed dose of 0.16 mg/kg/week
Somatropin medicinal product Norditropin at a fixed dose of 0.034 mg/kg/day 
Patients were treated for a main treatment period of 52 weeks. A 3-year safety extension period, 
where all study patients are allocated to somapacitan (0.16 mg/kg/week) is ongoing.
Dose reduction in consecutive steps of 25% of the current dose could be considered at the 
investigator’s discretion for adverse events judged as probably related to study product by the 
investigator. If the adverse event persisted, the study patient could be discontinued and if the adverse 
event resolved, the dose could then be resumed to the original planned dose at the investigator’s 
discretion. If measures of IGF-I SDS exceeded +2.5 SDS at two consecutive visits, the investigator 
was informed by the applicant. Dose reduction was then to be done by a 25% reduction of the current 
dose.

somatropin after 52 weeks of treatment on longitudinal growth in children with GHD. The specific 
purpose of the study was to confirm the non-inferiority of somapacitan relative to somatropin after 52 
weeks of treatment.
Secondary objective:
To compare the safety of somapacitan vs somatropin in children with GHD.

Notes: Secondary endpoints were not tested.
Primary endpoint: height velocity
The primary endpoint was annualised height velocity (HV) at week 52, measured in cm/year. 
Height velocity was derived from height measurements taken at baseline and the week 52 visit: height 
velocity = (height at the 52-week visit - height at baseline)/(time from baseline to the 52-week visit in 
years).
Height SDS (HSDS) was derived using Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) standards5 
and height velocity SDS was derived using Prader standards6 as reference data.

Blood samples were drawn for the assessment of IGF-I and IGFBP-3. Samples were drawn prior to 
study drug administration, if planned on a sampling day. The central laboratory and Novo Nordisk were 
responsible for providing age and sex-appropriate normal reference ranges of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 and 
for calculation of IGF-I SDS according to the following equation:
For determining bone age, X-ray images of left hand and wrist for bone age assessment according to 
the Greulich and Pyle atlas were taken. The X-ray images were sent to a central imaging laboratory for 
evaluation. An X-ray taken within 13 weeks prior to screening could be used as screening data if the 
image was acquired according to the required standards defined by the central imaging laboratory and 
available to be sent to the central imaging laboratory. 
 Sample size
The sample size of N=200 with a 2:1 randomisation ratio would achieve close to 90% power for the 
primary estimand using the hypothetical strategy, using conservative assumptions for the SD and 
taking into account the targeted estimand, with a non-inferiority margin of a -1.8 cm/year difference 
between somapacitan and somatropin. 
The non-inferiority margin was discussed during scientific advice, using of 1.8 cm/year difference 
advice EMEA/H/SA/2492/3/2018/PED/II, and was in principle supported.
 Randomisation and Blinding (masking)
Study patients were randomised in a 2:1 manner to receive either somapacitan or somatropin 
treatment, using a central interactive web response system. 
To ensure equal distribution of important prognostic factors across treatments, the randomisation was 
stratified by: 




region (Japan versus rest-of-the-world) 
age group (< 6 versus ≥ 6 years at randomisation) 
gender (boys versus girls) 
growth hormone peak level (< 7.0 versus ≥ 7.0 ng/ml).
After the main study period of 52 weeks, all study patients initially randomised to somatropin were 
switched to treatment with somapacitan. 
This study was open-label. The study was observer-blinded with regard to primary endpoint, i.e., the 
person performing the height measurements was blinded to treatment allocation. Novo Nordisk staff 
involved in the interpretation of all data was kept blinded during the study conduct until the database 
lock for the primary endpoint.
 Statistical methods
Statistical methods have been pre-specified in the protocol. No specific SAP has been developed. 
Definition of analysis sets
The following analysis sets were defined in the protocol:
Full analysis set (FAS): all randomised study patients. Study patients were analysed “as randomised”.
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of 
indication variation 
EMA/268297/2023 
Page 42/96
Per protocol (PP) analysis set: study patients from the FAS who had not violated any 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and had used 90% of the planned exposure of randomised treatment during 
the main study period (corresponding to at least 47 weeks for study patients receiving somapacitan or 
329 days for study patients receiving somatropin). Study patients were analysed “as treated”.
Safety analysis set (SAS): all randomised study patients were exposed to at least one dose of 
randomised treatment. Study patients were analysed “as treated”.
The following 2 observation periods were used in the study:
On-treatment: from the first administration and up until the last study contact, visit 7 or 14 days after 
the last administration, whichever comes first.
In-study: from first administration and up until visit 7 or last study contact, whichever comes first.
The data used in the primary EMA estimand (i.e. up to discontinuation of randomised treatment) was 
as prespecified in the protocol and described together with the statistical model. The FAS was used for 
evaluation of all efficacy endpoints. The PP analysis set was used for supplementary, sensitivity 
efficacy analyses, while the SAS was used for safety data analyses only.
Adjustment for multiplicity
No adjustment was made for multiplicity. Differing primary estimands for EMA and FDA/PMDA were not 
adjusted for. Secondary endpoints were not included in any kind of test hierarchy and no adjustment 
for multiplicity was performed. No interim analysis has been performed for the primary endpoint.
The one-sided test used for the primary endpoint is based on an alpha level of 2.5%. All other 
statistical tests conducted will be two-sided on the 5% significance level.
Definition and analysis of primary estimand 
Differing feedback on the primary estimand from the health authorities at end of phase 2 has resulted 
in establishing distinct estimand strategies for FDA/PMDA and EMA. 
Primary estimand for EMA: Hypothetical strategy – ancillary therapy not available: the treatment 
difference between somapacitan and somatropin in mean annualised HV at week 52 if ancillary therapy 
had not been available prior to week 52 (i.e. assuming no initiation of ancillary therapy) in children 
with GHD. When assessing the treatment effect on longitudinal growth, the hypothetical strategy-
based estimand is expected to minimise potential confounding from ancillary therapy such as other 
growth hormone products. The use of ancillary therapy may attenuate the treatment effect of interest 
or even exaggerate the treatment effect and the estimand, thus aiming to reflect the treatment 
difference attributable to the initially randomised treatments. 
The treatment policy strategy (primary estimand for FDA and PMDA) was considered supportive. This 
estimand assesses the expected benefit a future paediatric population with GHD can achieve if 
prescribed somapacitan compared to somatropin. By not placing any restrictions on treatment 
adherence, this estimand aims to obtain a difference as close as possible to the one expected in clinical 
practice, provided that the treatment adherence and use of ancillary therapy in trial reflects what 
would be seen in clinical practice.
The primary analysis of the primary endpoint addressing the hypothetical estimand was based on FAS, 
but data assessed after discontinuation of randomised treatment was disregarded in the analysis. To 
estimate this hypothetical strategy a mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) with an 
unstructured covariance matrix was conducted on height velocity data (annualized height velocity at 
planned visits at week 13, 26, 39 and 52) up to discontinuation of randomised treatment for each 
treatment group using all randomised study patients and assuming missing at random (MAR) for both 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of 
indication variation 
EMA/268297/2023 
Page 43/96
treatment groups. The MMRM included treatment, gender, age group, region, growth hormone peak 
group and gender by age group by region interaction term as factors and baseline height as a 
covariate, all nested within week as a factor.
A tipping point analysis was conducted, since one study patient discontinued treatment and thus, this 
study patient’s visit 7 measurement was not made ‘on-treatment’. 
Supplementary sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint was conducted on the PP data analysis set.
Choice of non-inferiority margin
A non-inferiority margin of -1.8 cm/year for the primary endpoint was chosen based on placebo- 
controlled study results for children with small for gestational age from the GHLIQUID-1424 study. In 
previous phase 3 studies in children with GHD, a non-inferiority margin of -1.8 to -2.0 cm/year has 
been applied.
Non-inferiority of somapacitan relative to somatropin was considered confirmed if the lower boundary 
of the two-sided 95% confidence interval of the hypothetical estimand was above -1.8 cm/year. If non-
inferiority is confirmed, superiority will be considered confirmed if the lower boundary of the two-sided 
95% confidence interval is above 0 cm/year. 
Analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints
All supportive, secondary efficacy endpoints were analysed based on the “in-study” observation period 
within the main study period (52 weeks of treatment), referring to the observation period from first 
administration and up until visit 7 or last study contact, whichever comes first. 
The two pharmacodynamic endpoints, IGF-I SDS and IGFBP-3 SDS, were analysed using the “on- 
treatment” observation period also (from the first administration and up until the last study contact, 
visit 7 or 14 days after the last administration, whichever comes first). 
Secondary endpoints were not included in any kind of test hierarchy and no adjustment for multiplicity 
was performed.
Subgroups
In addition to the pre-specified analyses, the treatment effect of somapacitan on the primary endpoint, 
height velocity after 52 weeks of treatment, was evaluated in different subgroups, to assess whether 
the overall treatment effect of somapacitan is consistent across subgroups of region (Japan versus 
rest-of-the-world), age (< 6 years versus ≥ 6 years at randomisation) and gender (boys versus girls).
Results
 Participant flow
In total, 348 children were screened until the database lock of 03-Dec-2021 (Figure 14). The main 
reason for screen failure was violating of inclusion criterion 9 (IGF-I < -1.0 SDS at screening). Two 
hundred (100%) children with GHD were randomised and exposed to treatment. Of these, 132 children 
were exposed to somapacitan and 68 to somatropin. 
Study patients discontinuing treatment were able to continue in the study to attend study visits. 
All 200 paediatric GHD patients completed the study period, and 199 (99.5%) children completed the 
treatment period. One child in the somapacitan group discontinued treatment prematurely due to 
being included in the study in violation of inclusion and/or exclusion criteria. 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of 
indication variation 
EMA/268297/2023 
Page 44/96
In total, 10 children in the somapacitan group and 4 children in the somatropin group were randomised 
in violation of inclusion or exclusion criteria. Except for the one subject who discontinued treatment, 
the subjects who were randomised in error remained on treatment, as the applicant assessed that the 
protocol deviations did not incur any increased safety risk.

 Recruitment
According to ClinicalTrials.gov the first participant was enrolled May 20, 2019. The main study period 
was completed on November 10th, 2021, when the primary outcome was measured for the last 
participant. The study is expected to be completed on December 12th, 2024.
 Conduct of the study
Protocol amendments
The original protocol was version 1.0 29 June 2018, which was amended to version 2.0 16 November 
2018 for all countries, to version 3.0 on 01 July 2019 applicable in all countries. Protocol version 4.0, 
5.0 and 6.0 entailed changes only applicable for Estonia, Hungary and Spain specifically. 
In protocol version 7.0, released 22 February 2021 and applicable in all countries, an additional test for 
superiority of somapacitan versus somatropin for height velocity (HV) from baseline to week 52 was 
added, in case non-inferiority of somapacitan versus somatropin for the primary endpoint has been 
confirmed. Furthermore, some secondary endpoints for effect have been removed, as they are not 
found relevant in the single-arm extension period of the study.
No GCP inspection was conducted.

The mid-parental height (standard deviation) in the somapacitan and somatropin treatment groups 
were similar (168.8 (8.6) versus 167.2 (8.7) cm). 
At screening, mean bone age was 4.15 years (min: 0.3 years; max: 9.0 years) in the somapacitan 
group and 4.24 years (min: 1.3 years; max: 9.0 years) in the somatropin group. The mean 
chronological age at baseline was 6.38 years (min: 2.5 years; max: 10.8 years) in the somapacitan 
group and 6.43 years (min: 2.7 years; max: 11.0 years) in the somatropin group. 
Measures of laboratory parameters at screening (glucose metabolism, haematology and hormones) 
and baseline (biochemistry and lipids) were similar between the somapacitan and somatropin group.
Adherence
Adherence to treatment was assessed via study patient e-diaries. The majority of children received the 
planned treatment with a mean adherence among study patients on treatment (i.e. not counting

exposure duration in 1 study patient after discontinuing treatment) of 95.8% for the somapacitan 
group and 88.3% for the somatropin group.
 Numbers analysed
All 200 randomised children were included in both the full analysis set (FAS) and the safety analysis 
set (SAS): 132 children in the somapacitan group and 68 children in the somatropin group. 
From the per protocol analysis set 14 (7%) children were excluded, 10 in the somapacitan group and 4 
in the somatropin group.
One subject discontinued the study product in the somapacitan group.
 Outcomes and estimation
Primary estimand: height velocity at week 52
The primary endpoint, height velocity at week 52 (annualised) was analysed using two different 
estimands. For EMA the primary estimand was hypothetical. Only 1 study patient discontinued 
treatment in the somapacitan group during the 52-week main period of the study. Similar increases in 
height velocities across all 4 quartiles of the midparental height were observed at week 52.
For FDA and PMDA the treatment policy estimand was the primary estimand. The results are presented 
below.

Non-inferiority of somapacitan relative to somatropin medicinal product Norditropin was confirmed for 
the hypothetical estimand as the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (-1.1 cm/year) was 
higher than the predefined non-inferiority margin of -1.8 cm/year. The treatment policy estimand 
supported this conclusion.

Secondary outcomes (supportive): HVSDS, HSDS and bone age
For the secondary growth-related endpoints, change from baseline to week 52 in HVSDS, HSDS and 
bone age, the in-study observation data sets were used for all analyses (from first administration and 
up until visit 7 or last study contact, whichever comes first), resulting in a treatment policy estimand. 
Across all growth efficacy measures, increases from baseline were observed for both somapacitan and 
somatropin after 52 weeks of treatment (Table 14).

From baseline to week 52, the observed mean (SD) HSDS increased from -2.99 (1.02) to -1.78 (0.95) 
for somapacitan and from -3.47 (1.52) to -2.09 (1.12) for somatropin.
The observed mean (SD) HVSDS increased from -2.35 (1.51) to 5.61 (2.85) for somapacitan and from 
-2.52 (1.55) to 6.45 (3.51) for somatropin, from baseline to week 52.
Moderate increases in bone age/chronological age ratio (generally staying below 1) were observed 
from baseline to week 52 for both treatment groups. The observed mean (SD) bone age (years) 
increased moderately from 4.15 (1.74) to 5.30 (2.02) for somapacitan and from 4.24 (2.01) to 5.52 
(2.22) for somatropin, from baseline to week 52, respectively. 
Secondary outcomes (supportive): IGF-I SDS and IGFBP-3 SDS
IGF-I SDS increased rapidly from baseline after initiating treatment with both somapacitan and 
somatropin (Figure 16). The observed mean IGF-I SDS increased from very low baseline levels (below 
-2) in both treatment groups to week 52 values within the normal range (-2 to +2).  The vast majority 
(97%) of study patients in the somapacitan group had average IGF-I SDS levels within normal range (-
2 to +2) after 52 weeks of treatment. 
The IGF-I samples depicted here were taken at different time points after dosing: week 4 and week 
26: day 1-4 after dosing (around peak IGF-I SDS level); week 13 and week 39: day 7 after dosing 
(around trough IGF-I SDS level); week 52: day 4-6 after dosing (around average IGF-I SDS level).

Page 49/96
The observed mean IGF-I SDS (SD) at week 52 using the in-study observation period was 0.28 (1.28) 
for somapacitan and 0.10 (1.09) for somatropin. Change from baseline to week 52 in IGF-I SDS was 
similar between the two treatment groups; ETD (somapacitan - somatropin) = 0.03 [95% CI -0.30; 
0.36]. The estimated increases of IGF-I SDS from baseline at 52 weeks (in-study data) were 2.36 for 
somapacitan and 2.33 for somatropin. 
The observed mean (SD) IGFBP-3 SDS levels were -0.33 (0.96) and -0.46 (0.94) for somapacitan and 
somatropin, respectively (in-study data). The estimated increases from baseline for IGFBP-3 at week 
52 were 1.61 in both treatment groups. Changes from baseline in IGFBP-3 SDS levels (in-study data) 
were similar for somapacitan and somatropin (estimated treatment difference 0.01 (95% CI -0.22; 
0.23)).
Patient reported outcomes
The disease specific TRIM-CGHD-O questionnaire was applied to assess the disease burden of growth 
hormone deficiency on children diagnosed with GHD. Comparable improvements were seen in both 
treatment groups, assessed as decreased scores relative to baseline in all 3 domain scores (physical 
functioning, emotional well-being, social well-being) and total score of TRIM-CGHD-O, were observed 
in both treatment groups after 52 weeks. 
Disease specific questionnaires were applied to measure the burden of growth hormone treatment on 
the study patients (TB-CGHD-O) and on the parents/LARs (TB-CGHD-P). At week 52 results favoured 
somapacitan over somatropin (Figure 17).

 Ancillary analyses
The efficacy of somapacitan on the primary endpoint (height velocity after 52 weeks) was in study 
4263 evaluated in different intrinsic subgroups including demographic factors (age, gender and 
previous growth hormone treatment status). 
Meeting selection criteria
15 subject-level protocol deviations were reported for 14 study patients in Phase 3 study 4263 (10 
study patients in the somapacitan group [7.6%] and 4 subjects in the somatropin group [5.9%]), who 
were randomised in violation of inclusion or exclusion criteria. Most of these study patients stayed on 
treatment since the protocol deviations were assessed not to incur safety issues.
The results for the per protocol analysis i.e. upon exclusion of the 14 subjects who did not meet the 
selection criteria for inclusion in study 4263 were almost identical to the results from the full on-
treatment observation period data set (all included study patients): estimated treatment difference of -
0.5 cm/year [95% CI -1.2; 0.2] for the per protocol analysis versus -0.5 cm/year [95% CI -1.1; 0.2] 
for the primary analysis.
Age group
The estimated treatment differences for height velocity after 52 weeks were similar between the two 
age groups as seen in Table 17. A slightly greater increase in the estimated height velocity after 52 
weeks was observed for the youngest children (<6 years) relative to the older study patients (≥ 6 
years) for both treatment groups.

Treatment naïve vs previously treated
All study patients in study 4263 and cohort I of study 4172 were treatment-naïve at randomisation. 
The previously treated study patients of cohort III from study 4172 showed overall maintained growth 
and pharmacodynamic endpoint levels after initiating somapacitan treatment. 
Growth hormone peak level
In CHMP scientific advice EMEA/H/SA/2492/3/2018/PED/II it was advised to define growth hormone 
deficiency based on a peak growth hormone level of <7 ng/ml instead of the currently applied level of 
≤10 ng/ml in study 4263. 
In several post-hoc analyses, the pharmacodynamic and efficacy evaluations were analysed for a peak 
growth hormone level < 7 ng/ml and a peak growth hormone level ≥ 7 ng/ml (Table 17).

Growth parameters for both study treatments tended to increase, for peak growth hormone levels < 7 
ng/ml and those ≥ 7 ng/ml. 
The observed height velocities at week 52 were similar between the somapacitan and somatropin 
groups, regardless of growth hormone peak level. Overall similar results for both study patients with 
growth hormone peak <7 ng/ml (estimated treatment difference (ETD) = -0.7 cm/year [95% CI -1.5;

the primary analysis of the total population (ETD= -0.5 cm/year [95% CI -1.1; 0.2]).
Analyses of changes from baseline IGF-I SDS showed similar effects of growth hormone treatment on 
IGF-I level changes for GHD study patients with growth hormone peak <7 ng/ml (ETD= -0.07 [95% CI

date
Design
The results presented reflect the data available in the clinical database as of:
1) 03-Dec-2021 (all data except some anti-somapacitan antibody and 
pharmacokinetic data and 4 bone age assessments). 
2) 17-Dec-2021 (adding the remaining anti somapacitan antibody data, 
pharmacokinetic data and bone age assessments)
The study was a randomised open-labelled two-group (somapacitan and 
somatropin) study investigating the effect and safety of once-weekly somapacitan 
treatment compared to daily somatropin in growth hormone treatment naïve pre-
pubertal children with GHD.
The study consisted of a 52-week main period (completed), followed by a 3-year 
single-group extension period (ongoing) with once-weekly dosing of somapacitan 
to evaluate safety. The total study duration for a study patient will be 4 years and 
the follow-up period will be a minimum of 30 days. The doses up to week 52 were 
0.16 mg/kg/week for somapacitan and 0.034 mg/kg/day for somatropin. After 
completion of the main phase at week 52, the somatropin study patients were all 
switched to 0.16 mg/kg/week somapacitan for the rest of the study.
This table covers the results of the main 52 week phase.

Endpoints and 
definitions
Primary endpoints: 
 Height velocity (HV) (cm/year) during the first 52 weeks of treatment. 
Primary estimand (EMA); Hypothetical strategy - ancillary therapy not 
available: The treatment difference between somapacitan and Somatropin in 
mean annualised HV at week 52 if ancillary therapy had not been available prior 
to week 52 (i.e., assuming no initiation of ancillary therapy) in children with GHD.
A hypothetical strategy was chosen, as initiation of ancillary therapy may make 
the treatments look more similar, tending towards non-inferiority. 
Non-inferiority testing: a non-inferiority margin of -1.8 cm/year for the primary 
endpoint was chosen. Thus, non-inferiority of somapacitan relative to somatropin 
would be confirmed if lower bound of the 95% confidence interval was higher than 
the non-inferiority margin of -1.8 cm/year.   
Confirmatory secondary endpoint: 
There were no confirmatory secondary endpoints in study NN8640-4263 (REAL 4)
Supportive secondary endpoints: 
Change from baseline to week 52 in: HVSDS, HSDS, bone age, IGF-I SDS and 
IGFBP-3 SDS.

Height velocity and change from baseline in HSDS and HVSDS at week 52 were similar for somapacitan 
(0.16 mg/kg/week) in both studies, whereas the estimates were somewhat lower for somatropin in the 
smaller study 4172, compared to study 4263. Notably, these lower values were based on 14 study 
patients only.
Mean IGF-I SDS levels stayed within the normal range in both studies. Observed and average (model- 
derived) IGF-I SDS at week 52 was similar between the two studies (mean of 0.53 in study 4263 and 
mean of 0.55 in study 4172).
2.6.5.6.  Supportive studies
Study 4263 – after week 52
Efficacy data from the ongoing part of the phase 3 study 4263 are summarised below based on the ‘in-
study’ observation period.
Study patient disposition – ongoing study phase
At the data cut point (10-Nov-2021), 68 study patients in the somatropin/somapacitan group and 130 
study patients in the somapacitan/somapacitan group had entered into the safety extension phase. At 
the data cut point (10-Nov-2021), a total of 4 study patients in the somapacitan/somapacitan group 
had withdrawn from the study due to withdrawal by parent/legally authorized representative, lost to 
follow-up, or other, non- specified reason.
Growth based parameters – ongoing study phase
Height velocity beyond 52 weeks, in-study
Mean height velocity (cm/year) showed continuously maintained effects beyond week 52 in both the 
somapacitan/somapacitan group (study patients who were randomised to somapacitan at week 0) and 
the somatropin/somapacitan group (study patients who were randomised to somatropin at week 0 and 
switched to somapacitan at week 52) (Figure 18). Overall, increases in height velocity compared to 
baseline were maintained up to week 117, although height velocity gradually declined over time after 
the initial increase observed at week 13.

HSDS beyond 52 weeks, in-study
Change from baseline in HSDS followed the trend from the main 52-week phase of the study and 
increased continuously from week 52 to week 104 for both treatment groups. HSDS appeared to 
increase to the same extent in the somapacitan/somapacitan group and the somatropin/somapacitan 
group.
Similar to the results described for height velocity, very few study patients contributed to the later 
timepoints, causing the apparent decreases at weeks 104 and 117 of observed HSDS. When evaluating 
HSDS over time solely in the study patients having completed up to week 104 or up to week 117, it 
was seen that HSDS increased continuously in these study patients in both treatment groups.

FAS
Change from baseline HSDS by visit up to week 117– mean plot – in-study - 
HVSDS beyond 52 weeks, in-study
Change from baseline in HVSDS followed the same trend as height velocity from week 52 to week 104, 
as from week 13 to week 52, i.e. continuing the same expected, slightly, decreasing levels over time. 
Similar conclusions regarding decreasing the number of study patients over the last visits as presented 
above for the observed values of height velocity and HSDS, also apply for HVSDS.
Bone age beyond 52 weeks, in-study
Bone age measures were performed only at baseline and the week 52 and 104 visits. Bone age 
increased from baseline in both treatment groups until week 104. The bone age to chronological age 
ratio generally stayed below 1 in both treatment groups, also after 104 weeks of treatment.
IGF-I SDS
Observed IGF-I SDS levels up to week 104 were similar to the levels observed in the 52-week main 
phase (Figure 20). Mean IGF-I SDS levels up to week 104 (last available assessment) stayed within 
the normal range [-2; 2] in both the somapacitan/somapacitan group and the somatropin/somapacitan 
group. The study patients switching from somatropin to somapacitan at week 52 showed a similar 
development in mean observed IGF-I SDS up to week 104 as the study patients already on 
somapacitan (-0.53 for somapacitan/somapacitan and -0.60 for somatropin/somapacitan). No IGF-I 
SDS data for visits later than week 104 were available at the data cut-point.

PRO data
At the cut-off of 10-Nov-2021, responses to the GH-PPQ at week 56 of study 4263, had been collected 
for 41 of the 68 study patients switching from somatropin to somapacitan after week 52.
37 of the 41 study patients preferred somapacitan to somatropin, while the remaining 4 study patients 
had no preference. 31 of the 37 study patients who preferred somapacitan, reported “strong” or “very 
strong” preference for somapacitan. 28 of the 37 reported they would be more adherent to 
somapacitan, once-weekly, than to daily growth hormone treatment, while 8/37 reported they did not 
expect difference in adherence between the two treatments. One study patient (1/37) reported 
expectation of higher adherence to somatropin. 
The top selected reasons listed for preferring somapacitan to somatropin were: “number of times 
needing to do injections” (20 of 37), “less worried about remembering to give injections” (16 of 37) 
and “child less worried about getting injections” (12 of 37).
Study 4172 – after week 208
In this section, selected efficacy results for the supportive study 4172 extending beyond week 208 up 
to week 286 for cohort I and up to week 65 and week 52, for cohorts II and III, respectively, are 
presented. 
Study patient disposition – ongoing study phase
There were no study patient discontinuations in the long-term safety extension period (from week 156 
to week 364) in neither cohort I, nor in cohorts II or III.
Growth parameters in cohort I
Growth benefits as assessed by height velocity, HVSDS, and HSDS were at least maintained after week 
208 up to week 286. Mean height velocity ranged from 6-8 cm/year at most visits. Mean HVSDS 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of 
indication variation 
EMA/268297/2023 
Page 60/96
stayed above 0. Generally, data at the latter visits were available for relatively few study patients, 
suggesting that results should be interpreted with caution.
No study patients reached near adult height in cohort I. 
IGF-I SDS followed the same trajectory as observed until week 156 up to week 286 and overall stayed 
within normal levels [-2; 2].
The bone age/chronological age ratio followed the same trends as observed until week 156 overall 
staying below 1 up to week 260.
Growth parameters in cohorts II and III
Data were consistent with initially obtained results: Overall, improvements in all height-based 
outcomes were observed in the treatment naïve study patients of cohort III (age above 9 years (girls) 
/ 10 years (boys) at enrolment) and were maintained in the previously treated study patients in cohort 
II (age below 2½ years) and cohort III. 
No study patients reached near adult height in cohorts II and III. 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy
The clinical efficacy of somapacitan treatment in growth hormone treatment-naïve, prepubertal 
paediatric patients with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) was evaluated in one Phase 2 dose-finding 
supporting study ((NN8640-)4172) and one Phase 3 pivotal study ((NN8640-)4263). 
The on-going phase 2 dose-selection study 4172 consists of the main study plus extension 
(26+26= 52 weeks), safety extension (104 weeks), and the long-term safety extension (208 weeks). 
In the main and extension study phase, the clinical effects of three doses (0.04, 0.08, and 0.16 
mg/kg/week) of weekly somapacitan (ntotal= 45), were compared with those of daily somatropin at a 
dosage of 0.034 mg/kg/day (i.e. a total of 0.24 mg/kg per week) (n= 14) at a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Upon 
request, the applicant indicated that the block size for worldwide randomisation was four. Both study 
treatments were administered subcutaneously in this cohort (cohort I). The nature of the study 
treatment (somapacitan/somatropin) was open-label. Somapacitan-treated patients in the main and 
extension study phase were blinded for the somapacitan dosage. From week 52 all somapacitan-
treated patients received open-label somapacitan at a dosage of 0.16 mg/kg/week. From week 156 
this also applied to the patients who were initially treated with somatropin. From week 156 paediatric 
GHD patients under 2.5 years of age (cohort II) and paediatric GHD patients aged 9-17 years (girls), 
and 10-17 years (boys)(cohort III) are included. From week 156 onwards, all study patients in all 
cohorts were treated with somapacitan at a dosage of 0.16 mg/kg/week. The long-term safety 
extension part of the study is still ongoing.
The selected study treatments and their dosages based on previous studies, including non-clinical 
studies, and clinical studies in adult GHD patients are acceptable. Applied inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, and the endpoints of study 4172 are in line with the EMA scientific advice 
EMEA/H/SA/2492/3/2018/PED/II. 
Although double-blind treatment should have been provided in a double-blind manner to all study 
patients from a scientific perspective, the key endpoints of study 4172 (height parameters, IGF-I SDS 
levels) were detected in an objective manner by blinded study personnel. 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of 
indication variation 
EMA/268297/2023 
Page 61/96
The primary endpoint (the annualized height velocity at week 26), and supportive secondary endpoints 
including growth-related parameters (e.g. height velocity SDS, height SDS) and IGF-I SDS are 
acceptable, since these endpoints are important for the evaluation of the clinical effects of growth 
hormone in paediatric GHD patients. 
The annualized height velocity increased from 3.5-4.8 cm per year at baseline to more than 8 cm per 
year in all treatment arms at week 26. At week 26, a dose-dependent effect in annualized height 
velocity was observed for increasing weekly doses of somapacitan (0.04 mg/kg: 8.0 cm/year, 0.08 
mg/kg: 10.9 cm/year, and 0.16 mg/kg: 12.9 cm/year). A similar trend for this endpoint was observed 
at week 52 (0.04 mg/kg: 7.8 cm/year, 0.08 mg/kg: 9.7 cm/year, and 0.16 mg/kg: 11.5 cm/year). 
Similar trends were observed at week 26 and 52 for the changes from baseline in height SDS and IGF-
I SDS levels. The available study data at the data cut-off point of 26-Aug-2021 indicate that the clinical 
effects of somapacitan maintain with time in cohort I, both for study patients who continued to receive 
somapacitan, and those who switched from somatropin to somapacitan during the study (growth 
hormone-experienced at the switching time). Limited available data in cohorts II and III indicate 
comparable clinical effects as in cohort I. The bone age/chronological age ratio remained below 1 
throughout study 4172. This observation was later explained that although the bone age will accelerate 
upon growth hormone treatment, the bone age still lags behind the chronological age.
Patient-reported outcomes in cohort I (not evaluated in cohort II and III) indicated a larger 
improvement for the highest dose of somapacitan (0.16 mg/kg/week) compared to somatropin up to 
week 156. 
In case IGF-I SDS levels >+2 are observed, the dose needs to be decreased and IGF-I SDS levels re-
assessed until IGF-1 SDS levels are below +2 SDS and preferably close to zero. Therefore, guidance on 
the dose titration for the paediatric population was included in the SmPC., taking into consideration the 
GHD Modelling Report, but also the possibility that for patients down-titrated to a lower dose level, 
stepwise dose increases are possible when growth velocity is not satisfactory.
Design and conduct of clinical studies
Study design. Study 4263 is an ongoing pivotal, randomized, open-label, Phase 3 clinical study in 
paediatric GHD patients in which the clinical effects of once-weekly somapacitan at a dosage of 0.16 
mg/kg/week were compared with those of daily treatment with somatropin at a dosage of 0.034 
mg/kg/day (i.e. a total dose of 0.24 mg/kg/week) during a 52-week main study phase. Included study 
patients were centrally allocated to somapacitan or somatropin, at a 2:1 ratio. The primary endpoint, 
the annualized height velocity, was determined at week 52. 
The main study period was followed by an ongoing safety extension period up to 3 years in which all 
study patients received somapacitan at a dosage of 0.16 mg/kg/week. The clinical database was 
locked on the 17th of December 2021.
Due to the open-label design of Phase 3 study 4263, the study results of this study may be affected by 
bias to some extent. However, growth parameters which concern key endpoints in this study, can be 
measured objectively. For the more subjective patient-reported outcomes a bias can not be excluded. 
This should be taken into account when interpreting these results.
Study population. In pivotal study 4263, growth hormone treatment-naïve pre-pubertal paediatric 
GHD patients aged 2.5 years up to 10 years (girls) or 11 years (boys) were included. These study 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of 
indication variation 
EMA/268297/2023 
Page 62/96
patients were generally selected in line with general EMA guidance in this respect 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/94528/2005 Rev. 1) and EMA scientific advice on somapacitan 
(EMEA/H/SA/2492/3/2018/PED/II). The clinical effects of somapacitan in paediatric GHD patients 
under 2.5 years of age (cohort II) and those aged 9 years (girls) or 10 years (boys) up to 17 years 
(cohort III) are currently evaluated as part of dose-finding study 4172 (see above). 
In study 4263, a confirmed GHD diagnosis was based on a peak growth hormone level of ≤ 10.0 ng/ml 
using the WHO International Somatropin 98/574 standard. However, in the CHMP scientific advice 
(EMEA/H/SA/2492/3/2018/PED/II) a more stringent 7 ng/ml growth hormone level upon stimulation 
was advised. The applicant showed later that similar results would have been obtained, if the growth 
hormone peak level for diagnosis of GHD and eligibility into the study would be <7 instead of ≤10 
ng/ml.
In the aforementioned scientific advice cycle it was recommended to include a selection criterion 
accounting for parental height in order to avoid the overrepresentation of children with small parents 
and thus height targets. Such a selection criterium could not be found. The applicant showed later in 
post-hoc analyses that the results for the primary endpoint were comparable for each quartile of the 
midparental height. 
Comparator. In study 4263, the clinical effects of weekly somapacitan at a dosage of 0.16 mg/kg/week 
were compared with those of daily dosed somatropin product Norditropin, both at a total weekly dose of 
0.24  mg/kg/week.  The  selected  dosage  of  somatropin  product  Norditropin  is  in  line  with  the 
recommended  posology  in  the  SmPC  of  this  medicinal  product.  It  is  acknowledged  that  a  weekly 
somapacitan  dosage  of  0.16  mg/kg/week  was 
supported 
in  EMA 
scientific  advice 
EMEA/H/SA/2492/3/2018/PED/II. 
Endpoints. The primary efficacy endpoint in study 4263 was the annualized height velocity at week 
52. Secondary efficacy endpoints in this study included changes in height standard deviation score 
(SDS), height velocity SDS, bone age, and serum IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels compared to baseline. The 
aforementioned primary and secondary endpoints are relevant for the evaluation of the clinical effects 
of growth hormone treatment and were considered acceptable in EMA scientific advice 
EMEA/H/SA/2492/3/2018/PED/II.
Statistical analysis. The clinical effects of somapacitan and somatropin were compared with respect 
to the primary endpoint annualized height velocity at week 52 in study 4263. In line with EMA advice, 
the difference between these treatments with respect to the primary endpoint was analyzed assuming 
that no ancillary treatment was initiated in paediatric GHD patients (hypothetical strategy). The 
treatment difference between somapacitan and somatropin in mean annualised height velocity at week 
52 for all randomised study patients, regardless of treatment adherence or initiation of ancillary 
therapy in children with GHD was analysed according to the treatment policy strategy (primary 
estimand for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and PMDA). For treatment comparisons between 
somapacitan and somatropin, a non-inferiority margin of 1.8 cm/year was chosen. Respective non-
inferiority margin was supported in EMA scientific advice EMEA/H/SA/2492/3/2018/PED/II. 
Since study 4263 was not developed to demonstrate statistical differences with respect to secondary 
endpoints in the main study phase, no definitive conclusions can be made based on respective 
endpoints. 
The endpoints in the safety extension phase were evaluated in a descriptive manner, since no 
comparisons between study arms can be made in this study phase.

Efficacy data and additional analyses
Patient disposition. 200 Study patients were randomized in study 4263. 131 Of 132 (99.2%) study 
patients randomized to somapacitan and all study patients randomized to somatropin completed the 
study. Hence, premature study dropout was minimal and well-balanced between treatment arms.
In total, 10 children in the somapacitan group and 4 children in the somatropin group were randomised 
in violation of inclusion or exclusion criteria. The applicant acknowledged later that these patients were 
randomized by mistake. Although the aforementioned study patients had to be excluded from study 
participation taking into account the study selection criteria, respective study patients received study 
treatment and were followed up in the study. The applicant showed at a later stage that the results 
with respect to the primary endpoint remain similar with and without including the aforementioned 14 
study patients in the main analysis.
Baseline characteristics. In study 4263, the demographics and baseline data between the treatment 
groups were balanced. At baseline, study patients had diminished growth with a mean height velocity 
of about 4 cm/year (somapacitan: 4.3 cm/year, somatropin: 4.1 cm/year), a mean height SDS of 
about -3 (somapacitan: -3.0, somatropin: -3.5). The majority of study patients (88.0%) had isolated, 
idiopathic aetiology of growth hormone deficiency.
The proportions of men of the total study population that was included in study 4263 were respectively 
75% and 73.5% in study patients who were treated respectively with somapacitan and somatropin. 
These proportions exceed the male proportion of growth hormone deficiency patients of 66.7%, i.e. a 
male: female ratio of 2:1, reported in literature (e.g. Grimberg et al. 2005). The impact of the 
preponderance of men on the interpretation of the result of study 4263 will be limited. 
Compliance. The majority of paediatric GHD patients received the planned treatment with a mean 
adherence among study patients on treatment of 95.8% for the somapacitan group and 88.3% for the 
somatropin group. Hence, the compliance rates for study treatment were high. 
Annualized height velocity. The estimated mean annualized height velocity at week 52 according to 
the hypothetical strategy (primary endpoint EMA) was 11.2 cm/year for somapacitan and 11.7 cm/year 
for somatropin in study 4263. Hence, the estimated treatment difference in height velocity at week 52 
between somapacitan and somatropin was -0.5 cm/year (95% CI -1.1; 0.2). Non-inferiority of 
somapacitan relative to somatropin was confirmed for the hypothetical estimand as the lower bound of 
the 95% confidence interval (-1.1 cm/year) was higher than the predefined non-inferiority margin of -
1.8 cm/year. 
Height velocity SDS. In study 4263, the estimated mean changes from baseline in height velocity 
SDS at week 52 compared to baseline were comparable for somapacitan and somatropin (respectively 
8.05 vs. 8.82; estimated treatment difference -0.78 (95% CI -1.63, 0.08)).
Height SDS. In study 4263, the estimated mean changes from baseline in height SDS at week 52 
compared to baseline was comparable for somapacitan and somatropin (respectively 1.25 vs. 1.30; 
estimated treatment difference -0.05 (95% CI -0.18, 0.08)).
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of 
indication variation 
EMA/268297/2023 
Page 64/96
Bone age/ chronological age. In study 4263, the estimated mean changes from baseline in bone 
age relative to chronological age at week 52 compared to baseline was comparable for somapacitan 
and somatropin (respectively 0.06 vs. 0.08; estimated treatment difference -0.02 (95% CI -0.06, 
0.01)).
IGF-I SDS levels and IGFBP-3 SDS levels. In study 4263, mean IGF-I SDS levels increased rapidly 
from baseline after initiating treatment with both somapacitan and somatropin. The observed mean 
IGF-I SDS increased from very low baseline levels (below -2) in both treatment groups to week 52 
values within the normal range (-2 to +2). Change from baseline to week 52 in IGF-I SDS was similar 
between somapacitan and somatropin (2.37 for both; estimated treatment difference 0.04 (95% CI -
0.29; 0.37)). In line with this, changes from baseline to week 52 in IGFBP-3 SDS levels (in-study data) 
were similar for somapacitan and somatropin (1.62 vs. 1.61; estimated treatment difference 0.02 
(95% CI -0.21; 0.24)).
Treatment evaluation. Guidance for clinicians in clinical practice with respect to the treatment 
evaluation of somapacitan in paediatric GHD patients was initially missing. Later, the applicant 
indicated that IGF-I SDS levels should be evaluated in paediatric GHD patients. Since approximately 
95% of individuals in a reference population have IGF-I SDS levels within the range from -2 up to +2 
SDS7, this also concerns the IGF-I SDS target range for paediatric GHD patients.8 In line with general 
practice the applicant recommends evaluating the efficacy and the safety of somapacitan in paediatric 
GHD patients at approximately 6 to 12-month intervals by evaluating auxological parameters, 
biochemistry (IGF-I, hormones, glucose and lipid levels), and pubertal status. More frequent 
evaluations should be considered during puberty. Moreover, the treatment should be discontinued in 
patients having achieved final height or near final height, i.e. an annualised height velocity <2 
cm/year, and a bone age is > 14 years (girls) or > 16 years (boys) which corresponds to the closure of 
the epiphyseal growth plates. Once the epiphyses are fused, patients should be clinically re -evaluated 
for the need for growth hormone treatment. This information has been included in SmPC section 4.2.
Subgroup analyses. With respect to the primary endpoint in study 4263 subgroup analyses were 
conducted with respect to age (<6 years vs. ≥ 6 years), gender, growth hormone treatment 
experience, and with respect to the Japanese study population. Regarding the height velocity at week 
52 compared to baseline, similar trends in effects between somapacitan and somatropin were observed 
in GHD patients under 6 years of age (12.2 vs. 12.6 cm/year; estimated treatment difference -0.4 
(95% -1.4; 0.7)) and those aged 6 years and above (12.2 vs. 12.6 cm/year; estimated treatment 
difference -0.4 (95% -1.4; 0.7)) in study 4263. For this endpoint similar trends were also observed in 
men (11.1 vs. 11.5 cm/year; estimated treatment difference -0.4 (95% -1.1; 0.3)) and women (11.8 
vs. 12.3 cm/year; estimated treatment difference -0.5 (95% -2.2; 1.1)). 
All study patients in study 4263 and cohort I of study 4172 were treatment-naïve at randomisation. In 
the study patients in study 4172 who were initially treated with somatropin maintained growth and 
adequate IGF-I SDS levels after initiating somapacitan treatment.

Somapacitan also increased height velocity (cm/year) in the subgroup of 30 Japanese study patients. 
The height velocity estimates after 52 weeks were 10.3 cm/year and 9.9 cm/year, for somapacitan and 
somatropin, respectively, with an estimated treatment difference of 0.3 [95% CI -0.9; 1.5]. 
Hence, observed trends in effects were similar for study patients of different age (< 6 years and ≥ 6 
years), gender, growth hormone treatment experience, and in the geographic region of Japan. This 
supports the use of somapacitan in naïve and growth hormone treatment-experienced patients of 
different age and gender, also in Japan.
Treatment burden. In study 4263, the treatment burden tended to be lower upon somapacitan as 
compared to somatropin treatment at week 52. The estimated treatment differences between 
somapacitan and somatropin of the total score (-6.0 (95% CI -10.0; -2.1)) of the treatment burden 
measure–child GHD-parent (TB-CGHD-P) scale tended to be more favourable for somapacitan as 
compared to somatropin, in line with its emotional sub score (-5.3 (95% CI -10.0; -0.7)), and 
interference subscores (-6.7 (95% CI -11.6; -1.9)). However, the estimated treatment differences 
between somapacitan and somatropin of the total score (-2.4 (95% CI -5.7; 0.9)) of the treatment 
burden measure–child GHD-observer (TB-CGHD-O) scale were similar, in line with its physical (-2.9 
(95% CI -6.8; 1.0)), emotional (-3.5 (95% CI -9.5; 2.4)), and interference sub- scores (-1.3 (95% CI 
-3.9; 1.3)).
At week 52 of study 4263 96% of the respondents in study 4263 found the somapacitan and 
somatropin devices to be easy or very easy to use. A high proportion of respondents (>90%) found the 
devices easy or very easy to learn to use (G-DAT).
At the cut-off of 10-Nov-2021, responses to the growth hormone patient preference questionnaire 
(GH-PPQ) at week 56 of study 4263, had been collected for 41 of the 68 study patients switching from 
somatropin to somapacitan after week 52. 37 Of the 41 study patients (90.2%) preferred somapacitan 
to somatropin, while the remaining 4 study patients had no preference. The most selected reasons 
listed for preferring somapacitan to somatropin were: “number of times needing to do injections” (20 
of 37), “less worried about remembering to give injections” (16 of 37) and “child less worried about 
getting injections” (12 of 37). 28 Study patients (68.3%) reported they would be more adherent to 
somapacitan, once-weekly, than to daily growth hormone treatment. 
Ancillary analyses. The available results of the clinical studies 4172 and 4263 were in line with the 
literature indicating that growth in paediatric GHD patients continues at a smaller, more constant rate 
after an initial catch-up growth in treatment-non-naïve paediatric GHD patients.9
However, no study patients have thus far reached near adult height. In line with EMA scientific advice 
EMEA/H/SA/2492/3/2018/PED/II determination of the final height of somapacitan-treated paediatric 
GHD patients in the conducted clinical studies is important to gain insight into the long-term clinical 
efficacy of somapacitan in patients who continued to use somapacitan without switching to or addition 
of alternative growth hormone options. This will be tracked via a post-authorisation measure. Further, 
the final results of ongoing Phase 2 dose-finding study 4172 and the pivotal Phase 3 study 4263 will be 
submitted as a post-authorisation measure.
Special populations. As expected, no patients aged 65 years and above are included in these studies. 
No adjustment of the somapacitan starting dose is needed in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy
The clinical studies which were submitted support the clinical efficacy of the somapacitan treatment in 
paediatric GHD patients. The height velocity at week 52 of somapacitan at a once-weekly dosage of 
0.16 mg/kg/week was non-inferior to that of somatropin at a once-daily dosage of 0.034 mg/kg/day in 
paediatric GHD patients.
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy:
The clinical effects of long-term somapacitan treatment in paediatric GHD patients should be evaluated 
further (post-authorisation measures including the PASS proposed by the applicant).
2.6.8.  Clinical safety
The safety information with somapacitan is based on the data obtained from 3 clinical studies in 
children with GHD (Phase 1: study 4042; Phase 2: study 4172; Phase 3: study 4263). 
The confirmatory global Phase 3 study 4263 provides safety data from the completed main period of 
the study (52 weeks) which included daily treatment with somatropin medicinal product Norditropin as 
active comparator. Daily somatropin has been used as the treatment of GHD for more than 30 years, 
thereby providing a clinically relevant comparator for which extensive safety data has been 
accumulated. 
Safety data is also obtained from the Phase 2 study 4172 (208 weeks completed), which included a 
somatropin group for the first 156 weeks of the study. For the clinical pharmacology study 4042, 
limited safety data are available due to the low exposure in the study (single-dose).
The main safety evaluation of somapacitan is based on pooled global data (adverse events) (also 
referred to as the safety pool). The safety analysis set for the pooled global data comprised all children 
with GHD enrolled in the clinical studies 4172 and 4263 who received at least one dose of somapacitan 
0.16 mg/kg/week (from the visit they start on the 0.16 mg/kg/week level) or somatropin. The 
somapacitan 0.16 mg/kg/week pool includes 194 children (132 children from study 4263, 52 children 
from study 4172 cohort I and 10 children from study 4172 cohorts II and III). The somatropin pool 
includes 82 children (68 children from study 4263 and 14 children from study 4172). Eleven (11) 
children switched from somatropin to somapacitan in study 4172 at week 156, giving a total of 265 
children in the total safety pool.
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure
The cut-off date for study 4172 was 19-Nov-2021 (database lock [DBL] for 208 weeks) and for study 
4263 03-Dec-2021 (1st DBL for 52 weeks) and 17-Dec-2021 (2nd DBL including remaining PK data, 
antibody data and bone age assessments). The cut-off date for inclusion of ongoing safety data was 
10-Nov-2021 (data lock point) for both studies 4172 and 4263. An additional cut-off for studies 4172 
and 4263 was 31-Dec-2021, providing updated information on serious adverse events after DBL to 31-
Dec-2021. No adverse events leading to discontinuation of study product were reported in studies 
4263 and 4172 by this cut-off.
A total of 194 children with GHD were exposed to somapacitan 0.16 mg/kg/week in the 2 ongoing 
clinical studies in GHD (studies 4263 and 4172). In study 4172, some of the children on somapacitan 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of 
indication variation 
EMA/268297/2023 
Page 67/96
0.16 mg/kg/week were initially randomised to somapacitan 0.04 and 0.08 mg/kg/week and switched 
to 0.16 mg/kg/week after 52 weeks. The safety pool contains all children from studies 4263 and 4172 
from the day they receive somapacitan 0.16 mg/kg/week. Up to 208 weeks of exposure to 
somapacitan has been evaluated in GHD (study 4172, ongoing).
A total of 82 children with GHD were exposed to daily somatropin 0.034 mg/kg/day as active 
comparator in the clinical studies in GHD (up to 156 weeks of exposure). The total exposure was 282.8 
patient-years for somapacitan 0.16 mg/kg/week and 104.5 person-years for somatropin. 
Table 20
Exposure - children with GHD (safety pool)
N: Number of study patients, SD: Standard deviation.  *Exposure days in the treatment period are calculated as 
time from first date on randomised treatment to last date on randomised treatment for Somatropin and plus six 
days for somapacitan or to visit 20 (week 208 for cohort I and week 52 for cohort II and III) for 4172 and for 4263 
to visit 7 (week 52), whichever comes first. The somapacitan (0.16mg/kg/week) safety pooled arm contains all 
study patients from 4263 and 4172 from the day they receive somapacitan 0.16mg/kg/week. **Last prescribed 
dose.
Through the somapacitan paediatric clinical development programme in GHD, 188 (96.9%) children 
were exposed to somapacitan for more than 6 months, 183 (94.3%) children were exposed for more 
than 12 months, and 39 (20.1%) children were exposed for more than 21 months.
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events
The safety profile of once-weekly somapacitan (administered s.c. to children with GHD for up to 52 
weeks in study 4263) was similar to the well-known safety profile for daily GH (e.g. somatropin). No 
new safety issues were identified. No local tolerability issues were identified.
In the safety pool, a similar proportion of children reported adverse events for the somapacitan 0.16 
mg/kg/week pool as observed for the somatropin pool (somapacitan 0.16 mg/kg/week: 73.2%; 
Somatropin: 67.1%).
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of 
indication variation 
EMA/268297/2023 
Page 68/96
A similar rate of adverse events was observed for somapacitan 0.16 mg/kg/week (230.9 adverse 
events/100 patient-years) as for Somatropin (232.4 adverse events/100 patient-years). The majority 
of the AEs were non-serious for both treatments.
The most frequent adverse events (≥5%) in the somapacitan group were (by proportion) pyrexia 
(12.4%), nasopharyngitis (11.9%) and headache (9.3%). These adverse events are also events 
commonly observed in children in general regardless of treatment or underlying disease. Adverse 
events reported for more than 2% of the children are summarised in Figure 21 and Figure 22.
There were no cases of lipohypertrophy or lipoatrophy in study 4263. One (1) case of lipodystrophy 
acquired was reported in the somapacitan group. The event was considered of mild severity and fully 
resolved. In study 4172, 2 cases of lipoatrophy (in 2 children treated with somapacitan 0.04 
mg/kg/week) were reported during the 4-year study period. None of the 2 cases were reported as 
serious adverse events. Both cases recovered after change of injection site.

Most frequent adverse events by preferred term (>=2%) - on-treatment - plot 
Severity
In the somapacitan 0.16 mg/kg/week pool, the majority of the adverse events were of mild or 
moderate severity. Five (5) children experienced 8 adverse events rated as severe, which were all 
adverse events expected in children. A similar proportion of children experienced severe adverse 
events in the 2 treatment groups (somapacitan: 2.6%; somatropin: 2.4%). In total, 5 of 8 severe 
adverse events reported with somapacitan were judged as possibly or probably related to somapacitan 
by the investigator, whereas 1 of 2 severe adverse events was judged as possibly or probably related 
to somatropin.
Adverse events possibly or probably related to study products
A similar proportion of children reported adverse events evaluated by the investigator as possibly or 
probably related to study products in the safety pool (somapacitan: 20.1%; somatropin: 18.3%) 
compared to study 4263.
In the somapacitan 0.16 mg/kg/week pool, the most frequently reported possibly or probably related 
adverse events ≥2% in children with GHD were headaches (somapacitan: 2.6%; somatropin: 8.5%). 
All other adverse events considered possibly or probably related to somapacitan by the investigator 
were reported in 1-3 children across different system organ classes and preferred terms.
The majority of the adverse events judged as possibly or probably related to somapacitan were of mild 
or moderate severity and non-serious. Two (2) adverse events considered possibly or probably related 
to somapacitan were reported as serious adverse events (vomiting and generalised oedema).
In the somatropin group, the most frequently reported possibly or probably related adverse events ≥
2% were headache (see above), pain in extremity (somapacitan: 1.5%; somatropin: 2.4%), vomiting 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of 
indication variation 
EMA/268297/2023 
Page 70/96
(somapacitan: 1.5%; somatropin: 3.7%), and hyperglycaemia (somapacitan: 0.5%; somatropin: 
2.4%). 
Adverse event data from the ongoing parts of the phase 3 study 4263 and phase 2 study 4172 are 
summarised below.  
Adverse events in ongoing parts of study 4263 and study 4172
Study 4263 after week 52
The safety profile in the ongoing part (week 52 to week 117) in study 4263 for serious adverse events 
and adverse events leading to discontinuation of study product) was similar to the safety profile in the 
completed main 52-week period of the study.
A similar proportion of children reported adverse events in the 2 treatment groups 
(somapacitan/somapacitan: 38.5%; somatropin/somapacitan: 39.7%) and similar adverse event rates 
were also reported (somapacitan/somapacitan: 121.4 adverse events /100 patient-years; 
somatropin/somapacitan: 123.1 adverse events/100 patient-years).
No deaths or adverse events leading to the discontinuation of the study product were reported.
Two (2) serious adverse events (Covid-19 infection and Gastroenteritis) were reported in 1 study 
patient. Both events recovered. Somapacitan treatment was temporarily interrupted due to the Covid-
19 infection.
Generally, low numbers of adverse events were reported within the safety focus areas. 
Four (4) children experienced 4 injection site reactions (reported as adverse events). All cases were of 
mild severity. None of the injection site reactions was reported as serious adverse events. There were 
no injection site reactions linked to premature treatment discontinuation.
Lipodystrophy was reported in 2 children, whereof 1 child also reported lipodystrophy in the 52-week 
main period of the study. The events were mild and moderate, were judged as possibly and probably 
related to treatment and both events resolved. 
Study 4172 – after week 208
The safety profile in the ongoing part (after week 208 up to week 286) in study 4172 (cut-offs: 10-
Nov-2021 for all adverse events and additional cut-off of 31-Dec-2021 for serious adverse events and 
adverse events leading to discontinuation of study product) was similar to the safety profile in the 
completed 208 weeks of the study.
No deaths or adverse events leading to discontinuation of study product were reported.
One (1) serious adverse event of anaphylactic shock was reported with onset day 1518. The child had 
a well-known food allergy (wheat and egg) and also experienced an anaphylactic shock with onset day 
861. The event resolved and no change in dose was made. 
One (1) case of mild scoliosis was reported.
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events
No deaths were reported in the clinical studies with somapacitan in children with GHD (study 4263, 
52 weeks; study 4172, 208 weeks; study 4042, 1 week).
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of 
indication variation 
EMA/268297/2023 
Page 71/96
A similar pattern of serious adverse events was observed for the somapacitan 0.16 mg/kg/week safety 
pool as for the pivotal Phase 3 study. A similar low proportion of children reported serious adverse 
events in both treatment groups (somapacitan: 10 (5.2%) children reported 14 serious adverse 
events; somatropin: 4 (4.9%) children reported 6 serious adverse events). Serious adverse events 
were single events reported in 1 child, except for 2 serious adverse events of vomiting. 
Two (2) serious adverse events (generalised oedema, vomiting) occurring in the same study patient 
were evaluated as probably related to study product (somapacitan 0.16 mg/kg/week) and treatment 
was temporarily interrupted in both cases. 
In study 4172, 2 children experienced an anaphylactic reaction/shock in the somapacitan group. Both 
had well-known food allergy. 
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings
There were no apparent clinically relevant changes from screening in the clinical laboratory 
haematology or biochemistry parameters assessed in children with GHD in any of the treatment 
groups/studies. 
Vital signs and ECGs
No clinically relevant changes from baseline in ECGs and vital signs (mean systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure and pulse) were observed following somapacitan treatment in the clinical studies in children 
with GHD. Similar mean values were observed for somapacitan and somatropin.
Body weight
As expected in growing children, the mean body weight increased across all treatment groups from 
baseline to week 52 in study 4263 and from baseline to week 208 in study 4172. There were no 
adverse events that concerned changes in weight. 
Physical examination
A total of 15 children had abnormal physical examinations reported as clinically significant at screening 
or during the 52-week main period of the pivotal study 4263 (somapacitan: 12 children, 6 at 
screening; somatropin: 3 children, all at screening). Four (4) cases were reported as adverse events in 
the somapacitan group (lymphadenopathy, adverse events included fever and rhinitis; exanthema, 
adverse event rash; dermatitis atopic; skin lesion, adverse event molluscum contagiosum).
In the supportive study 4172, there were 20 abnormal physical examinations reported as clinically 
significant across treatment groups up to week 208. 3 cases were reported as adverse events in the 
somapacitan group (haematoma left thigh, lipoatrophy, and skin atrophy).
Bone age
In both clinical studies, bone age approached chronological age. The bone age vs. chronological age 
ratio for individual study patients was below 1 for most children after 52 weeks (study 4263) and 208 
weeks (study 4172) of treatment. There were no clinically relevant differences in change from baseline 
in bone age between somapacitan and somatropin. There were no adverse events that concerned bone 
age in the two studies. 
Glycaemic control
In the pivotal Phase 3 study 4263, there were no clinically relevant changes in mean fasting blood 
glucose or HbA1c from baseline to week 52 with somapacitan treatment. At baseline and after 52 weeks 
of exposure, the mean HbA1c values were similar between the treatment groups 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of 
indication variation 
EMA/268297/2023 
Page 72/96
(week 52: somapacitan: 5.31%; somatropin: 5.31%). The mean fasting insulin level was within the 
reference ranges. The changes observed in fasting insulin were within expectation when administering 
growth hormone and was similar between somapacitan and somatropin. 
In the supportive Phase 2 study 4172, there were no clinically relevant changes from baseline in mean 
fasting glucose, insulin or HbA1c which were similar for somapacitan and somatropin. 
In study 4263, after 104 weeks of exposure, mean fasting blood glucose was similar in the 2 treatment 
groups (somapacitan/somapacitan: 4.7 mmol/l; somatropin/somapacitan: 4.6 mmol/l). Likewise, mean 
HbA1c values were similar between the 2 treatment groups (somapacitan/somapacitan: 5.32%; 
somatropin/somapacitan: 5.35%). The mean fasting insulin level was within the reference ranges.
2.6.8.5.  Safety in special populations
In alignment with the ICH M4E guideline, adverse events were also evaluated in the following 
subgroups in the pivotal study 4263: sex (male/female) and age group (<6 years/ ≥6 years).
Based on the adverse event profiles, there were no specific safety concerns observed in any of the 
investigated subgroups. Similar trends were observed in the subgroups as for the total patient 
population.
Adverse events in children with IGF-I SDS above +2 at two or more consecutive visits
No trend was seen in the amount or type of adverse events reported in children with IGF-I SDS above 
+2 at two or more consecutive visits in the pivotal study 4263 (somapacitan: 5 children, 3.8%; 
Somatropin: 2 children, 2.9%), compared to the remaining children in the relevant treatment groups. 
There were no serious adverse events reported for these study patients and no dose reductions due to 
the adverse events. 
One child in each treatment group had dose reductions (of 25%) due to IGF-I SDS exceeding +2.5 
SDS at 2 consecutive visits. No safety issues were observed in relation to the IGF-I SDS levels above 
+2.5 in the 2 children. 
In the supportive phase 2 study 4172, no trend was seen in the amount or type of adverse events 
reported in children with IGF-I above +2 at two or more consecutive visits compared to the remaining 
study patients in the relevant treatment groups.
2.6.8.6.  Immunological events
Overall, the low immunogenicity observed with somapacitan is consistent with that reported for other 
growth hormone products.
In the main 52-week period of the pivotal study 4263, non-neutralising antibodies were detected in 20 
(15.2%) somapacitan-treated children (including 4 children with positive antibodies at baseline which 
are most likely false positive findings as the children were naïve to growth hormone treatment) and 
7 (10.3%) children treated with somatropin. Of these, 2 (1.5%) children in the somapacitan group and 
1 (1.5%) child in the somatropin group had at least two consecutive positive antibody samples.
Immunogenicity data in the supportive study 4172 with somapacitan treatment up to 208 weeks were 
consistent with the Phase 3 data. Non-neutralising antibodies were detected in 10 somapacitan treated 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of 
indication variation 
EMA/268297/2023 
Page 73/96
children (22.2%), and 1 child (7.1%) treated with somatropin. Of these, 3 (6.7%) children in the 
somapacitan groups and 1 (7.1%) child in the somatropin/somapacitan group had at least 2 
consecutive positive antibody samples.
Data on immunogenicity from the ongoing part of studies 4263 (after week 52) and 4172 (after week 
208) were consistent with data in the completed part of the studies. Hence, based on the totality of 
data, the formation of anti-somapacitan antibodies did not appear to affect pharmacokinetics, 
pharmacodynamics, efficacy or adverse events reported (including injection site reactions and allergic 
reactions) in neither study 4263 nor study 4172.
2.6.8.7.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions
The potential clinically relevant drug interactions for somapacitan are listed in Table 23. The interaction 
between glucocorticoids and growth hormone has been further specified in the warnings and 
precautions for use. These drug interactions are based on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic 
properties of somapacitan and well-known interactions for daily growth hormone products.
Table 21
Drug-drug interactions
2.6.8.8.  Discontinuation due to adverse events
There were no children who withdrew from the study or discontinued study product due to adverse 
events in the any of the treatment groups in the 52-week main period of the pivotal Phase 3 study 
4263. 
In the supportive Phase 2 study 4172 up to week 208, no children who withdrew from the study or 
discontinued the study product due to adverse events in the somapacitan group. Two children treated 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of 
indication variation 
EMA/268297/2023 
Page 74/96
with Somatropin discontinued the study product prematurely due to adverse events (drug 
hypersensitivity and nephrotic syndrome).  
Adverse events leading to temporary discontinuation of study product
In the 52-week main period of study 4263, two (2) children treated with somapacitan and 5 children 
treated with Somatropin temporarily discontinued study product due to adverse events. In 3 cases, 
treatment was paused due to headache. Full recovery was reported for all cases and treatment was 
continued. 
In study 4172 up to week 208, eight (8) children treated with somapacitan and/or Somatropin had 
temporary discontinuation of study product due to adverse events.   
Adverse events leading to dose reduction
In the 52-week main period of study 4263, one (1) child treated with somapacitan had the dose 
reduced due to mild impaired fasting glucose at study day 369 (i.e., occurring at the week 52 visit). 
Two (2) children treated with somatropin had their dose reduced due to headache. 
In study 4172, there were no adverse events leading to dose reductions during the study period up to 
week 208. 
2.6.8.9.  Post marketing experience
Post-marketing data on children are not available as somapacitan is not yet marketed in paediatric 
indications.
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics.
The pooled safety data including all patients from the phase 2 and phase 3 study who received at least 
one dose of somapacitan or somatropin is submitted by the MAH as being supportive but will be 
considered pivotal in the safety assessment since the pooled database will give more insight in the 
rarer side effects. 
Exposure. A total of 194 children with GHD were exposed to somapacitan 0.16 mg/kg/week, the to-
be-marketed dose, in the Phase 2 study 4172 and Phase 3 study 4263. The extent of the exposure of 
children to somapacitan is considered extensive considering the rarity of the disease. 183 (94.3%) 
children were exposed for more than 12 months, which is also quite extensive. The long-term safety 
data is somewhat more limited, with only 39 patients exposed for more than 21 months. 
Adverse events. Overall, 73.2% of patients in the somapacitan 0.16 mg/kg/week group and 67.1% 
in the somatropin group experienced an adverse event. The majority of the adverse events were mild 
to moderate, and for the majority of cases, the adverse event resolved without sequela. 
The most frequent adverse events in children treated with somapacitan were pyrexia (12.4%) and 
nasopharyngitis (11.9%). Together with other frequently reported adverse events such as influenza, 
couch, respiratory tract infections, gastroenteritis and otitis media, these adverse events are 
considered common in children and are not likely to reflect drug-related adverse events. This is 
supported by the comparable numbers in the somatropin group. Headache occurred in 9.3% of 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of 
indication variation 
EMA/268297/2023 
Page 75/96
patients and is reported as common in the SmPC of somapacitan and somatropin. Overall, the safety 
profile of somapacitan resembles that of other growth hormone products. 
Constipation occurred more frequently in the somapacitan group compared to the somatropin group 
(1.2% in the somatropin group and 4.6% in the somapacitan group) in the safety pool. This is 
supported by data from the phase 3 study 4236. It is reasoned that the constipation might be part of 
hypothyroidism diagnosed in a reasonable number of patients, although other reasons could be 
involved as well (e.g. anticholinergics). 
Besides constipation, “pain in extremity” is one of the most frequently reported adverse events, with 
3.7% of patients in the somatropin group and 7.2% of the somapacitan group. Within the Phase 3 
study 4263, this difference is higher; 2.9% in the somatropin group and 9.1% in the somapacitan 
group. Nevertheless, pain in the extremity is often reported as not being related to treatment. Given 
the frequency of pain in the extremity in the somapacitan 0.16 mg/kg/week pool (7.2%) and the 
biological plausibility pain in extremity should be considered an ADR to somapacitan treatment. The 
approved SmPC is in line with these findings.
In total, 5 events of lipoatrophy/lipodystrophy were reported, 2 events in 2 patients in study 4172 and 
3 events in 2 patients in study 4263. For the events in study 4172, the events were judged as severe 
and probably related to the study drug. More specifically, the events were likely induced by multiple 
injections at the same site. The event of lipodystrophy in the 52-week part of study 4263 was judged 
as unrelated but this assessment is questioned. For the other 2 events, occurring in the ongoing part 
of study 4263, not further information seems to be available. Lipodystrophy is a known but rare side 
effect of growth hormone injectables. The phrasing in the SmPC currently reflects the diversity of the 
injection-induced morphological changes in the subcutaneous adipose tissue. 
Serious adverse events. In general, the incidence of serious adverse events was low within the 
safety pool: 10 patients (5.2%) experienced 14 events in the somapacitan group and 4 patients 
(4.9%) experienced 6 serious adverse events in the somatropin group. The majority of serious adverse 
events were in the system organ class of infections and infestations, which are not uncommon for 
children. Two events of anaphylactic reactions were reported, but in patients with known food allergies. 
Therefore, these cases were not judged as being related to the study treatment. This is supported. 
Laboratory parameters. There were no apparent clinically relevant changes from screening in the 
clinical laboratory haematology or biochemistry parameters. 
No adverse events were recorded related to altered glycaemic control. 
Safety in subgroups. The safety profile was assessed for the following subgroups in the pivotal study 
4263: sex (male/female) and age group (<6 years/ ≥6 years). Based on the adverse event profiles, 
there were no specific safety concerns observed in any of the investigated subgroups. Similar trends 
were observed in the subgroups as for the total patient population. Adverse events in children with 
IGF-I SDS <2 in more than 2 consecutive visits were comparable in both treatment arms.
Immunogenicity. Growth hormone products are known to have, varying degrees of immunogenicity. 
Anti-somapacitan antibodies were observed in 20 study patients in study 4263 and in 10 study patients 
in study 4172. Respective anti-somapacitan antibodies were non-neutralizing. In both study 4263 and 
study 4172, no effect of anti-somapacitan antibodies on the efficacy or safety of somapacitan could be 
observed.
The frequency of non-neutralising antibodies appears comparable between treatment arms. 
Safety in children below the age of 3 years. As no children <2. 5 years old were included in the 
pivotal study 4263 and only one child <2.5 years old in cohort II of study 4172 the clinical effects of 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of 
indication variation 
EMA/268297/2023 
Page 76/96
somapacitan in children <2.5 years old are very limited, and no benefit-risk assessment can be made 
based on these data. Further, the efficacy and especially the safety of long-acting growth hormone in 
these hormonally immature very young is unknown from the literature. Further an extrapolation on 
physiological ground appears difficult as the hormonal homeostasis (i.e. all pituitary axes) of the very 
young is different from those over the age of 2 – 4 years. Growth velocity in these children is mainly 
the result of the amount of food and not yet under the control of growth hormone. Further the glucose 
metabolism is under development with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia in the very young (below 
the age of 6month, see also EMEA-002692-PIP01-19 for lonapegsomatropin). This risk might be 
increased by the different IGF-I profile observed in the weekly growth hormone administration. 
A flexible daily dosing regimen with more limited amounts of growth hormone per injection is 
especially relevant in GHD patients under 3 years of age, taking into account the hormonal maturation 
and glucose homeostasis in these patients. Because of this, weekly somapacitan treatment is limited to 
paediatric GHD patients aged 3 years and above. 
Safety in adolescents GHD patients. The clinical data with somapacitan are at present also limited 
in adolescent GHD patients from 12 to 17 years old, although it is acknowledged that the clinical 
effects of somapacitan are still under evaluation in Cohort III of study 4172. It is not common to study 
the growth in pubertal children as the sexual development (and accompanying changes in sex 
hormones) dilutes the effect of the growth hormone. The effects in adolescents are commonly 
extrapolated (as is done for other growth hormone-containing products) from pre-pubertal children. 
However, given the lack of patients studied with long-acting somapacitan resulting in different IGF-I 
profiles, the safe and effective use in adolescents will be monitored in the proposed PASS. 
Safety in non-naive GHD patients. Information on safety (and efficacy) in non-naïve paediatric 
patients is lacking. Provided an adequate conversion is advised in section 4.2 the effects from the 
treatment naïve patients might be extrapolated to this non-naïve populationThe use in non-naïve 
patients will be part of the PASS.
Long-term safety. The long-term safety data from the ongoing extension studies do not raise 
additional safety concerns. The applicant is expected to submit the long-term safety data from the 
ongoing parts of the studies in due time (PAM). A PASS to collect more clinical data with somapacitan 
in children and adolescents, the near-adult final height and to collect safety data in the long–term 
especially regarding the potentially long term safety risks of diabetes and cancer has been proposed by 
the applicant. The study duration will be 10 years, with a minimum follow-up of patients for at least 5 
years. This should cover the insufficient duration of the extension parts of the clinical studies (4172 
and 4263) of 6.5 years and 3 years, respectively to respond to these uncertainties (NN8640-4787). 
This study was included in the updated RMP provided by the applicant. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety
The safety profile of somapacitan in paediatric GHD patients is in line with that of adult GHD patients 
and other growth hormone products. 
At present, limited data are available on the clinical effects of somapacitan in paediatric GHD patients 
under 3 years of age, adolescent GHD patients, and paediatric GHD patients who are non-naïve to 
growth hormone. Because of potential safety risks due to hormonal immaturity in GHD patients below 
the age of 3 years, the indication of somapacitan is restricted to GHD patients aged 3 years and above. 
Although efficacy and safety in adolescent GHD patients and non-naïve GHD patients can be assumed, 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of 
indication variation 
EMA/268297/2023 
Page 77/96
the clinical efficacy at an acceptable safety level of somapacitan will substantiated further as part of 
the PASS.
The applicant is expected to submit the long-term safety data from the ongoing parts of the studies in 
due time, as well as the proposed PASS.
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety:
A category 3 paediatric GHD register-based study (PASS) will be conducted. This will be a non-
interventional, observational, register-based study to investigate long-term safety and clinical 
parameters of somapacitan treatment in paediatric patients with GHD in the setting of routine clinical 
practice.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context
3.1.1.  Disease or condition
The indication approved at the time of the initial marketing authorisation of the medicinal product was 
for the replacement of endogenous growth hormone in adults with growth hormone deficiency.
 The applicant has proposed to extend the indication to endogenous growth hormone in children and 
adolescents with growth failure due to GHD.
The proposed indication within the line extension grouped with the variation procedure was:
Sogroya is indicated for the replacement of endogenous growth hormone (GH) in children and 
adolescents with growth failure due to growth hormone deficiency (GHD) and in adults with growth 
hormone deficiency (AGHD).
GHD is characterised by too low systemic levels of the growth hormone. The growth hormone is 
produced by the somatotroph cells of the anterior pituitary gland. The secretion of growth hormone 
from the pituitary gland is stimulated by growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and inhibited by 
somatostatin, both of which are produced by the hypothalamus. GHD is often associated with defects 
in the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus. 
The typical symptom of GHD in children is growth failure. Growth failure is suspected if the growth of 
paediatric study patients develops at a slower rate than expected based on the growth chart of the 
local geographic area. 
The incidence of growth failure associated with GHD has been estimated to be approximately 1:4000 to 
1:10,000.10 Once GHD is diagnosed, the aim of growth hormone treatment is to normalise the growth 
rate during childhood and attainment of normal adult height. 
In the current procedure, also an additional dose strength (15 mg somapacitan/ 1.5 ml solution) is 
proposed.

3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need
Available therapies
The aim of the treatment is to normalize the growth rate during childhood and attainment of normal 
adult height. For over 30 years, GHD has been treated with daily recombinant human growth hormone. 
The effects of human growth hormone replacement in children can be evaluated by assessing the 
increase in height velocity and related auxological parameters and bone maturation.
With current treatment algorithms, paediatric recombinant human growth hormone doses are based on 
the body weight of the growing child, which corrects for the higher physiological need for growth 
hormone during growth compared to adults. For safety reasons, IGF-I plasma concentrations should be 
maintained in the normal age and sex-adjusted range. Periodic checks of IGF-I levels are required 
because they may increase over time, even if the growth hormone dosage does not change.
For paediatric GHD patients, medicinal products for daily (e.g. Omnitrope (EU/1/06/332), Nutropin Aq 
(EU/1/00/164)) or weekly (e.g. Ngenla (EU/1/21/1617), Skytrofa (EU/1/21/1607)) growth hormone 
supplementation are available. 
Unmet medical need
While daily human growth hormone is safe and effective, its frequency of administration can be 
burdensome for both children and their caregivers. Although children with GHD treated with daily 
growth hormone replacement can achieve normal adult height, real-world outcomes have not matched 
expectations. Due to nonadherence rates ranging from 5 to 82% (Fisher 2013), most GHD patients do 
not reach their target genetic height (Guyda 1999, Lustig 2004), leaving an opportunity to improve 
treatment outcomes in paediatric GHD. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies
The pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and clinical effects of single doses of somapacitan were 
evaluated in a randomized, open-label Phase 1 study in 32 growth hormone treatment-experienced 
prepubertal GHD patients (study (NN8640-)4042). 
In randomized Phase 2 study (NN8640-)4172, the pharmacodynamic and clinical effects of weekly 
somapacitan at a dosage of 0.04, 0.08, and 0.16 mg/kg/week were compared with those of daily 
somatropin at a dosage of 0.034 mg/kg/day (i.e. a total weekly dose of 0.24 mg/kg) in 59 growth 
hormone treatment-naïve pre-pubertal GHD patients (cohort I) during a 26-week main treatment 
period, followed by a 26-week extension period (total: 52 weeks). In the safety extension period from 
week 52 to week 156, all somapacitan-treated study patients received weekly somapacitan at a dosage 
of 0.16 mg/kg/week, while the same initial daily dosage of somatropin was continued. In the long-term 
safety extension period from week 156 up to week 364, all included study patients received weekly 
somapacitan at a dosage of 0.16 mg/kg/week. Paediatric GHD patients under 2.5 years of age (cohort 
II), female GHD patients aged 9-17 years and male GHD patients aged 10-17 years (cohort III) were 
also included in this study phase and also received weekly somapacitan at a dosage of 0.16 
mg/kg/week. Inclusion and follow-up in the long-term safety extension period are ongoing.
In the randomized, pivotal Phase 3 study (NN8640-)4263, the pharmacodynamic and clinical effects 
of weekly somapacitan at a dosage of 0.16 mg/kg/week were compared with those of daily somatropin 
at a dosage of 0.034 mg/kg/day (i.e. a total weekly dose of 0.24 mg/kg) in 200 growth hormone

treatment-naïve pre-pubertal GHD patients during a 52-week main treatment period. In the extension 
period from week 52 to week 208 all included study patients received weekly somapacitan at a dosage 
of 0.16 mg/kg/week. The follow-up of study patients in this extension period is ongoing. 
3.2.  Favourable effects
Annualized height velocity, other growth-related parameters (as described below), and IGF-I SDS 
levels increased upon initiation of somapacitan treatment in paediatric GHD patients in both clinical 
studies 4172 and 4263. Overall, respective increases tended to be larger for a somapacitan starting 
dosage of 0.16 mg/kg/week as compared to 0.08 mg/kg/week in study 4172. It was explained that the 
somapacitan dosage of 0.16 mg/kg/week was selected as a starting dosage due to its more optimal 
treatment response.
The observed pharmacological effects with respect to the proposed 15 mg/1.5 ml somapacitan solution 
are in line with those of the authorized 5 mg/1.5 ml and 10 mg/1.5 ml somapacitan solutions. 
Annualized height velocity at week 52. The estimated mean annualized height velocity at week 52 
according to the hypothetical strategy (primary endpoint EMA) was 11.2 cm/year for somapacitan and 
11.7 cm/year for somatropin in study 4263. Hence, the estimated treatment difference in height 
velocity at week 52 between somapacitan and somatropin was -0.5 cm/year (95% CI -1.1; 0.2). Non-
inferiority of somapacitan relative to somatropin was confirmed for the hypothetical estimand as the 
lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (-1.1 cm/year) was higher than the predefined non-
inferiority margin of -1.8 cm/year. 
Height velocity SDS. In study 4263, the estimated mean changes from baseline in height velocity 
SDS at week 52 compared to baseline was comparable for somapacitan and somatropin (respectively 
8.05 vs 8.82; estimated treatment difference -0.78 (95% CI -1.63, 0.08)).
Height SDS. In study 4263, the estimated mean changes from baseline in height SDS at week 52 
compared to baseline was comparable for somapacitan and somatropin (respectively 1.25 vs 1.30; 
estimated treatment difference -0.05 (95% CI -0.18, 0.08)).
Bone age/ chronological age. In study 4263, the estimated mean change from baseline in bone age 
relative to chronological age at week 52 compared to baseline was comparable for somapacitan and 
somatropin (respectively 0.06 vs 0.08; estimated treatment difference -0.02 (95% CI -0.06, 0.01)).
IGF-I SDS levels and IGFBP-3 SDS levels. In study 4263, mean IGF-I SDS levels increased rapidly 
from baseline after initiating treatment with both somapacitan and somatropin. The observed mean 
IGF-I SDS increased from very low baseline levels (below -2) in both treatment groups to week 52 
values within the normal range (-2 to +2). With a somapacitan starting dosage of 0.16 mg/kg/week 
IGF-I SDS levels within the range -2 up to +2 SDS levels were obtained in about 97% of paediatric 
GHD patients at week 52 in study 4263. 
Change from baseline to week 52 in IGF-I SDS was similar between somapacitan and somatropin (2.37 
for both; estimated treatment difference 0.04 (95% CI -0.29; 0.37)). In line with this, changes from 
baseline to week 52 in IGFBP-3 SDS levels (in-study data) were similar for somapacitan and 
somatropin (1.62 vs 1.61; estimated treatment difference 0.02 (95% CI -0.21; 0.24)).
Subgroup analyses. With respect to the primary endpoint in study 4263, subgroup analyses were 
conducted concerning age (<6 years vs. ≥ 6 years), gender, growth hormone treatment experience, 
and the Japanese study population. Regarding the height velocity at week 52 compared to baseline, 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of 
indication variation 
EMA/268297/2023 
Page 88/96
comparable trends in effects between somapacitan and somatropin were observed in GHD patients 
under 6 years of age (12.2 vs 12.6 cm/year; estimated treatment difference -0.4 (95% -1.4; 0.7)) and 
those aged 6 years and above (12.2 vs 12.6 cm/year; estimated treatment difference -0.4 (95% -1.4; 
0.7)) in study 4263. For this endpoint similar trends were also observed in men (11.1 vs. 11.5 
cm/year; estimated treatment difference -0.4 (95% -1.1; 0.3)) and women (11.8 vs 12.3 cm/year; 
estimated treatment difference -0.5 (95% -2.2; 1.1)). Later, it was shown that the improvements with 
respect to growth parameters were comparable for GHD patients of both different gender and pubertal 
status (Tanner stage 1 versus Tanner stage >1).
All study patients in study 4263 and cohort I of study 4172 were treatment-naïve at randomisation. 
Study patients in study 4172 who were initially treated with somatropin maintained growth and 
adequate IGF-I SDS levels after initiating somapacitan treatment. 
Somapacitan also increased height velocity (cm/year) in the subgroup of 30 Japanese study patients. 
The height velocity estimates after 52 weeks were 10.3 cm/year and 9.9 cm/year, for somapacitan and 
somatropin, respectively, with an estimated treatment difference of 0.3 [95% CI -0.9; 1.5]. 
Hence, observed trends in effects were similar for study patients of different age (< 6 years and ≥ 6 
years), gender, growth hormone treatment experience, and in the geographic region of Japan. This 
supports the use of somapacitan in naïve and growth hormone treatment-experienced patients of 
different ages and gender, also in Japan.
Treatment burden. In study 4263, the total scores of the treatment burden measure–child GHD-
parent (TB-CGHD-P) scale (estimated treatment difference -6.0 (95% CI -10.0; -2.1)) and the 
treatment burden measure–child GHD-observer (TB-CGHD-O) scale (estimated treatment difference -
2.4 (95% CI -5.7; 0.9)) tended to be more favourable for somapacitan as compared to somatropin at 
week 52. 
In line with this, at week 52 of study 4263 96% of the respondents in study 4263 found the 
somapacitan and somatropin devices to be easy or very easy to use. At the cut-off of 10-Nov-2021, 
responses to the growth hormone patient preference questionnaire (GH-PPQ) at week 56 of study 
4263, had been collected for 41 of the 68 study patients switching from somatropin to somapacitan 
after week 52. 37 Of the 41 study patients (90.2%) preferred somapacitan to somatropin, while the 
remaining 4 study patients had no preference. The most selected reasons listed for preferring 
somapacitan to somatropin were: “number of times needing to do injections” (20 of 37), “less worried 
about remembering to give injections” (16 of 37) and “child less worried about getting injections” (12 
of 37). 28 Study patients (68.3%) reported they would be more adherent to somapacitan once-weekly 
than to daily growth hormone treatment. 
Ancillary analyses. In total, 10 children in the somapacitan group and 4 children in the somatropin 
group in study 4263 were randomised in violation of inclusion or exclusion criteria. It was clarified later 
that these study patients stayed on treatment since the protocol deviations were assessed not to incur 
safety issues. It was shown later that the results with respect to height velocity in an additional per 
protocol analysis i.e. upon exclusion of the 14 subjects who did not meet the selection criteria for 
inclusion in study 4263 were almost identical to the results from the full on-treatment observation 
period data set (all included study patients): estimated treatment difference of -0.5 cm/year [95% CI -
1.2; 0.2] for the per protocol analysis versus -0.5 cm/year [95% CI -1.1; 0.2] for the primary analysis.

EMA/268297/2023 
Page 89/96
The association between the treatment response and mid-parental height of the GHD study patients 
was initially unclear. In additional analyses of study 4263, the mean mid-parenteral height at baseline 
was comparable for GHD study patients in whom somapacitan or somatropin study treatment was 
initiated (respectively 168.8 and 167.2 cm). In addition, similar increases in height velocities across all 
4 quartiles of the mid-parental height were observed for both somapacitan and somatropin treatment 
at week 52. Hence, GHD patients responded to somapacitan irrespective of their mid-parental height.
In study 4263, a confirmed GHD diagnosis was based on a peak growth hormone level of ≤ 10.0 ng/ml 
using the WHO International Somatropin 98/574 standard. However, in the provided CHMP scientific 
advice (EMEA/H/SA/2492/3/2018/PED/II), a more stringent 7 ng/ml growth hormone level upon 
stimulation was advised. It was later demonstrated that similar study results would have been 
obtained if the growth hormone peak level for diagnosis of GHD and eligibility into the study would be 
<7 instead of ≤10 ng/ml.
Preliminary analyses in studies 4172 and 4263 indicate that the clinical effects of somapacitan 
concerning growth-related parameters and IGF-I SDS levels are maintained with time. 
Antibody development. Anti-somapacitan antibodies were observed in 20 study patients in study 
4263 and 10 study patients in study 4172. Respective anti-somapacitan antibodies were non-
neutralizing. The efficacy of somapacitan was neither affected by the formation of anti-somapacitan 
antibodies in study 4263 nor study 4172.
Compliance. The majority of paediatric GHD patients in study 4263 received the planned treatment, 
with a mean adherence among study patients on treatment of 95.8% for the somapacitan group and 
88.3% for the somatropin group. Hence, the compliance rate for study treatment was high. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects
In both studies 4172 and 4263, there was an open-label comparison between the clinical effects of 
somapacitan and somatropin treatment. Because of this, the study results of this study may be 
affected by bias to some extent. Growth parameters which concern key endpoints in this study can be 
measured objectively. However, subjective evaluations such as the evaluation of treatment burden and 
patient preferences are at increased risk of information bias. Knowledge about the allocated study 
treatment may affect the responses of study patients to such endpoints. Because of this, caution is 
needed with respect to the interpretation of subjective study endpoints.
At week 56 of study 4263, 90.2% of the somapacitan-treated but none of the somatropin-treated 
study patients preferred the treatment which they had received. Reasons for somapacitan preference 
included ‘number of times needing to do injections’, ‘less worried about remembering to give 
injections’, and ‘child less worried about getting injections’. Although a preference for somapacitan 
treatment is acknowledged, it is remarked that the preference assessment is subjective. In the case of 
an open-label treatment-comparison as in study 4263, knowledge of the allocated study treatment 
may affect the responses of study patients to subjective evaluations (information bias). Because of 
this, caution is needed with respect to the evaluation of treatment preference in study 4263.
The final results of on-going studies 4172 and 4263 paediatric GHD patients will be submitted after the 
approval of the extension of indication of somapacitan, as part of the post-authorisation measures.
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of

EMA/268297/2023 
Page 90/96
No study patients have thus far reached near adult height. In line with EMA scientific advice, 
EMEA/H/SA/2492/3/2018/PED/II determination of the final height of somapacitan-treated paediatric 
GHD patients in the conducted clinical studies is important to gain insight into the long-term clinical 
efficacy of somapacitan in patients who continued to use somapacitan without switching to or addition 
of alternative growth hormone options. This will be studied as part of the post-authorisation measures.
3.4.  Unfavourable effects
Overall, 73.2% of patients in the somapacitan 0.16 mg/kg/week group and 67.1% in the somatropin 
group experienced an adverse event. The majority of the adverse events was mild to moderate, and 
for the majority of cases, the adverse events were resolved without sequela. There were no treatment 
discontinuations due to adverse events. 
The most frequent adverse events in children treated with somapacitan were pyrexia (12.4%) and 
nasopharyngitis (11.9%), and headache (9.3%). A comparable number of patients experienced these 
adverse events in the somatropin group.  
Constipation occurred more frequently in the somapacitan group (4.6%) compared to the somatropin 
group (1.2%) in the safety pool. 
Pain in the extremity is one of the most frequently reported adverse events, with 3.7% of patients in 
the somatropin group and 7.2% in the somapacitan group. 
In total, 5 events of lipoatrophy/lipodystrophy were reported, 2 events in 2 patients in study 4172 
were judged as severe and probably related to the study drug and 3 events in 2 patients in study 4263 
were judged as mild-moderate and with causality questioned. 
In general, the incidence of serious adverse events was low within the safety pool: 10 patients (5.2%) 
experienced 14 events in the somapacitan group, and 4 patients (4.9%) experienced 6 serious adverse 
events in the somatropin group. 
Non-neutralizing anti-drug antibodies were found in 15.2% of patients in the somapacitan arm and 
10.3% of patients in the somatropin arm in study 4263.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects
The extent of the exposure of children to somapacitan is considered extensive considering the rarity of 
the disease. 183 (94.3%) children were exposed for more than 12 months, which is also quite 
extensive. The long-term safety data is somewhat more limited, with only 39 patients exposed for 
more than 21 months. 
Since the majority of patients received the to-be-marketed dose of 0.16 mg/kg/week, no dose-
response assessment is possible for adverse events.  
Although there are enough clinical data in all subsets of the paediatric GHD population with 
somatropin, the clinical data are too limited with somapacitan in GHD patients < 2.5 years old as only 
one child < 2.5 years old was included in cohort II of study 4172. No benefit-risk assessment can be 
made based on these data. Moreover, the PDCO provided a waiver for all subsets of the paediatric GHD 
population on the grounds of lack of significant therapeutic benefit and likely lack of safety due to 
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of 
indication variation 
EMA/268297/2023 
Page 91/96
potential induction of neoplasms and cerebrovascular diseases amongst the greatest theoretical risks 
of long-acting preparations due to their different PK profiles. Still, the safety of growth hormone 
preparations has been monitored for decades and no sign of an increased risk of neoplasms has been 
identified so far. In addition, no neoplasms or cases of onset of diabetes mellitus type 2 have been 
recorded during the clinical studies conducted in support of the present application. The CHMP also 
assessed that these important potential risks were addressed by the applicant through adequate 
routine risk minimization measures (Product Information). In addition, they are also mitigated through 
the proposed PASS which will address these safety concerns in the post-marketing setting. 
Further, the long-term efficacy and safety of long-acting growth hormone in these hormonally 
immature, very young GHD patients are unknown from the literature, and other long acting medicinal 
products were only recently authorised for marketing. Therefore, the current indication is restricted to 
GHD patients aged 3 years and above.
The clinical data with somapacitan are currently limited in adolescent GHD patients from 12 to 17 
years old, although it is acknowledged that the clinical effects of somapacitan are still under evaluation 
in Cohort III of study 4172. It is not common to study the growth in pubertal children as the sexual 
development (and accompanying changes in sex hormones) dilutes the effect of growth hormone. The 
effects in adolescents are commonly extrapolated (as is done for other growth hormone-containing 
products) from pre-pubertal children. However, given the lack of patients studied with long-acting 
somapacitan resulting in different IGF-I profiles, the applicant will include these patients in the PASS.
Despite the imbalance of incidence of constipation between the somapacitan and somatropin group, 
these events were often judged as unrelated to treatment. Although alternative causes for constipation 
can be identified for many patients, it is claimed that hypothyroidism may play a role in the cause of 
constipation

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects
Somapacitan is currently authorized for marketing in adult GHD patients (EU/1/20/1501). The study 
results of conducted clinical studies also support the clinical efficacy of somapacitan in paediatric GHD 
patients. Results concerning growth-related parameters were in line with each other across different 
studies. Somapacitan also promotes growth in paediatric GHD patients who have received prior 
somatropin treatment. Growth was maintained in somapacitan-treated GHD patients. Clinical effects of 
somapacitan up to a treatment period of 52 weeks were comparable for GHD patients of different mid-
parental height, gender and pubertal status (Tanner stage 1 versus Tanner stage >1). Bone age 
relative to chronological age was similar in study patients treated for one year with either somapacitan 
or somatropin. The efficacy of somapacitan was also supported by several patient/parent-reported 
outcomes. 
However, clinical data (efficacy and safety) with somapacitan are lacking, in particular, paediatric GHD 
subgroups, namely children < 2.5 years old, and non-naïve GHD patients. The clinical effects of 
somapacitan in patients under 2.5 years are currently evaluated in cohort II of study 4172. Especially 
in GHD patients below the age of 3 years, the benefit-risk cannot be established based on the 
information provided at the time of marketing authorization application, considering potentially 
increased safety risks due to hormonal immaturity. As a result of these uncertainties, the indication is 
restricted to patients 3 years or older.  
CHMP assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of 
indication variation 
EMA/268297/2023 
Page 93/96
Altogether, the efficacy data provide robust evidence for the clinical efficacy of weekly somapacitan 
treatment in paediatric GHD patients studied. 
The overall safety profile of somapacitan is in line with that of adults and in line with the known safety 
profile of growth hormone replacement therapies. Differences in constipation and pain in extremities 
were observed between the somapacitan and somatropin groups. 
Lipodystrophy is a known but rare side effect of injectable growth hormone. The risk of lipodystrophy 
can be adequately mitigated by injection side rotation as stated in the SmPC. 
Anti-drug antibodies were observed in a substantial number of patients. This is not uncommon for 
growth hormone replacement. In addition, the anti-drug antibodies were found to be non-neutralising 
and did not affect pharmacokinetics, safety or efficacy. 
The observed pharmacological effects concerning the proposed 15 mg/1.5 ml somapacitan solution are 
in line with those of the authorized 5 mg/1.5 ml and 10 mg/1.5 ml somapacitan solution
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks
The study results of conducted clinical studies support the efficacy of once-weekly somapacitan in 
paediatric GHD patients. This also applies to the proposed additional dose strength of 15 mg 
somapacitan per 1.5 ml solution. Results concerning different growth-related parameters were in line 
with each other and consistent over time across different studies. The results of the clinical studies 
were in line with the literature, indicating that growth in paediatric GHD patients continues at a lower, 
more constant rate after an initial catch-up growth in treatment-non-naïve paediatric GHD patients.11
An improvement concerning different patient/parent-reported outcomes was also demonstrated. The 
majority of GHD study patients preferred weekly somapacitan above daily somatropin treatment. 
From the limited population, a short-term safety profile of somapacitan emerged that appears to be in 
line with the known growth hormone-containing medicinal products. 
Considering, on the one hand, the efficacy of weekly somapacitan as compared to daily somatropin 
concerning growth-related parameters, the convenience of once-weekly somapacitan administration, 
and on the other hand, the comparable short-term safety profile of weekly somapacitan as compared 
to daily somatropin treatments, the benefits of short-term somapacitan treatment outweigh its risks. 
The long-term safety risks of somapacitan treatment are yet unknown. A PASS to collect more clinical 
data with somapacitan in children and adolescents with GHD, the near-adult final height and to collect 
safety data in the long–term, especially regarding the potentially long term safety risks of diabetes and 
cancer has been proposed by the applicant. The study duration will be 10 years, with a minimum 
follow-up of patients for at least 5 years. This should cover the insufficient duration of the extension 
parts of the clinical studies (4172 and 4263) of 6.5 years and 3 years, respectively to respond to these 
uncertainties (NN8640-4787). This study will be a category 3 study. 
Although the benefit/risk balance of the somapacitan growth hormone replacement treatment for 
paediatric GHD patients included in the studies is positive, the safety in GHD patients below 3 years of 
age cannot be established. Because of this, the indication of somapacitan is restricted to GHD patients 
aged 3 years and above). The CHMP has concluded that the benefit risk ratio for the proposed 
extension of indication is positive.

The CHMP has also agreed on the fact that proposed line extension to add a somapacitan dose 
strength of 15 mg somapacitan/1.5 ml solution is acceptable.
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance
The somapacitan medicinal product Sogroya (EU/1/20/1501) is indicated for the replacement of 
endogenous growth hormone in adults with GHD. The long-term safety risks of somapacitan are to be 
evaluated in a PASS.
3.8.  Conclusions
The overall benefit/risk balance of Sogroya is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’.
4.  Recommendations
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Sogroya is not similar to Skytrofa or Ngenla within the 
meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. See appendix on similarity.
Outcome
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality,safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of, Sogroya 15 mg/1.5 mL solution for injection in pre-filled pen is 
favourable in the following indication(s):
Sogroya is indicated for the replacement of endogenous growth hormone (GH) in children aged 3 years 
and above and adolescents with growth failure due to growth hormone deficiency (paediatric GHD), 
and in adults with growth hormone deficiency (adult GHD).
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for Sogroya subject 
to the following conditions:

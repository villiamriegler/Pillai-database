Steps taken for the assessment of the product 
The  Rapporteur’s  and  Co-Rapporteur’s  initial  assessment  reports  were  circulated  to  all 
Members of the previous CPMP on 12 October 1994. 
The consolidated list of questions was sent to the company on 9 January 1995. 
The  company  submitted  the  responses  to  the  CPMP  consolidated  list  of  questions  on 
12 April 1995. 
The  Rapporteur’s  and  Co-Rapporteur’s  assessment  report  on  the  responses  provided  by  the 
company was circulated to all CPMP Members by the Rapporteur on 31 May 1995. 
A revised Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) was circulated on 2 June 1995. Comments 
were required by 23 June 1995. 
The  company  was  asked  to  give  an  oral  explanation  on  11  July  1995  at  the  meeting  of  the 
CPMP.  The  oral explanation  with the  company took place  to  address concerns  on the  clinical 
safety profile and the lack of comparative clinical data in the Taxotere dossier. The company’s 
answers  were  considered  by  the  CPMP  on  11-12  July  1995.  The  CPMP  took  on  board  the 
recommendations of the ad hoc Working Group on Oncology meeting on 12 June 1995. 
The CPMP, at its meeting of 12 July 1995, having considered the application, recommended the 
granting  of  a  Marketing  Authorisation  under  exceptional  circumstances,  in  accordance  with 
Article 13 (2) of Council Regulation (EEC) 2309/93 and adopted its final positive Opinion for 
each of the two presentations of Taxotere. The Opinion was forwarded, in all official languages 
of the European Union, to the European Commission who issued a Marketing Authorisation for 
this medicinal product on 27 November 1995.

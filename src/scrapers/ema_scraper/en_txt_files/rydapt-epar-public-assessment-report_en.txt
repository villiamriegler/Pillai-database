2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) 
Treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) who are Fms like 
tyrosine kinase receptor 3 (FLT3) mutation positive in combination with standard daunorubicin and 
cytarabine induction and high dose cytarabine consolidation chemotherapy, and for patients in 
complete response followed by Rydapt single agent maintenance therapy. 
Aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM), systemic mastocytosis with associated haematological 
neoplasm (SM AHN) or mast cell leukaemia (MCL) 
Treatment of adult patients  with aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM), systemic mastocytosis with 
associated haematological neoplasm (SM AHN), or mast cell leukaemia (MCL). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Acute myeloid leukaemia  
The annual crude incidence of AML is 3.7 per 100,000 and the number of new cases per year in Europe 
is estimated at 18,400. AML is the most frequent form of leukaemia, accounting for approximately 
25% of all leukaemias in adults in the Western world. The incidence of AML increases sharply with age, 
ranging from 1.8 cases per 100,000 people aged less than 65 years of age to 17.6 cases per 100,000 
people over 65 years of age. More than half of the subjects with newly diagnosed AML in developed 
countries are over 65 years of age, with a median age at diagnosis of 67, and AML is more common in 
men than in women.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/516229/2017 
Page 10/209 
  
  
 
ASM, SM-AHN, MCL 
The incidence of ASM ranges between 0.01 and 0.03 cases per 100,000 person-years and its 
prevalence is between 0.1 and 0.3 cases per 100,000. The incidence rate of MCL is 0.01 per 100,000 
per year (Cohen et al., 2014). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Acute myeloid leukaemia  
Acute myeloid leukaemia is a form of leukaemia – i.e. cancer of the white blood cells – characterised 
by infiltration of proliferative, clonal, abnormally differentiated, and occasionally poorly differentiated 
haematopoietic cells of myeloid lineage in the bone marrow, blood, and other tissues. The prognosis of 
patients with AML varies dramatically as a result of a number of factors, including age, performance 
status, and cytogenetic and/or molecular genetic alterations including FLT3, NPM1, and CEBPA.  
Genetic alterations in FLT3 in AML 
Among the prognostic molecular alterations, one of the most important factors is the presence of FMS-
like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene mutations, which occur in ~30% of adult patients with AML and 
have a substantial negative impact on prognosis (Pemmaraju, Kantarjian, Ravandi, & Cortes, 2011). 
FLT3 encodes a class III receptor tyrosine kinase that consists of 5 immunoglobulin-like domains, a 
transmembrane domain, a cytoplasmic juxtamembrane domain, and 2 tyrosine kinase domains.  FLT3 
plays a critical role in normal haematopoiesis and cellular growth in primitive haematopoietic stem and 
progenitor cells. Under normal conditions, FLT3 is expressed on bone marrow haematopoietic stem 
cells, but this expression is gradually lost as cells differentiate.  
Mutant FLT3 is constitutively activated, which results in the proliferation and survival of leukaemic 
blasts. Two forms of FLT3-activating mutations are identified commonly in the blasts from patients 
with AML — internal tandem duplications (ITDs) and point mutations, both of which can occur in the 
juxtamembrane domain or the tyrosine kinase domain.  
FLT3-ITD mutations are observed in 20%-25% of de novo AML patients and in 30%-35% of the 
cytogenetically normal newly diagnosed AML patients (~30% of all patients with AML). The ITDs lead 
to an additional 3 to ≥100 amino acids inserted into the receptor, resulting in the ligand-independent, 
constitutive activation of FLT3. Point mutations of the FLT3 protein tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3-TKD 
mutations) are observed in 5%-10% of all AML patients and in 11%-14% of cytogenetically normal 
AML patients (Ferrara & Schiffer, 2013). Point mutations in the juxtamembrane domain appear to 
result in less activation compared with tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) point mutations or ITDs of the 
juxtamembrane domain.  
In addition to ITDs and TKD mutations, overexpression of FLT3 has been detected in both adult and 
paediatric patients with AML without FLT3 mutations and this overexpression may have an 
unfavourable prognostic impact on OS. 
Other relevant genetic alterations in AML 
Like alterations in FLT3, alterations in NPM1 and CEBPA have been shown to affect outcome of patients 
with AML, and in the 2016 revision to the WHO classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute 
leukaemia, “AML with mutated NPM1” and “AML with biallelic mutations of CEBPA” have become 
separate clinical entities. Furthermore, it is expected that additional markers (e.g., RUNX1, ASXL1, and 
TP53) that have consistently been associated with an inferior outcome will soon be included in these 
recommendations.

ASM, SM-AHN, MCL 
Mastocytosis is a heterogeneous myeloproliferative disorder characterised by the abnormal growth and 
accumulation of morphologically and immunophenotypically abnormal mast cells (MCs) in one or more 
organs. The disease can be limited to the skin (cutaneous mastocytosis) or involve extracutaneous 
tissues (systemic mastocytosis). Mastocytosis is frequently associated with a gain-of-function mutation 
in the KIT gene, and an Asp816 to Val (D816V)-encoding point mutation is present in 70-90% of 
patients with adult onset SM (Kristensen, Vestergaard, & Moller, 2011; Orfao, Garcia-Montero, 
Sanchez, Escribano, & Rema, 2007; Sotlar et al., 2010; Valent et al., 1994).  
Genetic alterations in KIT in ASM and MCL 
KIT is located at chromosome 4q12 and encodes KIT, a class III receptor tyrosine kinase. The type III 
class also includes platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), colony-stimulating factor 1 and 
FLT3 and is characterised by an extracellular component of 5 immunoglobulin-like domains, a 
transmembrane segment, a juxtamembrane domain and a cytoplasmic kinase domain with a 70–100 
amino acid kinase insert near its centre. Normally, KIT is activated when bound to its ligand, the stem 
cell factor (SCF), which is encoded by SCF on chromosome 12q22. KIT (CD117) is notably expressed 
by MCs, haematopoietic stem cells, germ cells, melanocytes and Cajal cells of the gastrointestinal tract 
and is therefore functionally relevant for MC development, haematopoiesis, gametogenesis and 
melanogenesis (Lim, Pardanani, & Tefferi, 2008). 
A large number of somatic heterozygous KIT alterations (point mutations and deletions/insertions) 
have been identified in patients with SM. In any given patient, one KIT alteration, or a combination of 
two or more KIT alterations, can occur. For several of these genetic alterations of KIT, changes in 
downstream KIT signalling pathways in MC have been identified (for review, see (Haenisch, Nothen, & 
Molderings, 2012)). As a result of these changes, KIT is converted into a constitutively active, 
dysregulated tyrosine kinase that signals independent of its endogenous ligand SCF (Molderings, 
2015). 
In the majority of patients with SM (70-90%), MCs display mutations in the activation loop of KIT, 
most frequently KIT D816V in exon 17. However, mutations outside of exon 17 occur in up to 44% of 
patients. In addition, genetic alterations in other genes are also found in a large proportion of the 
patients (e.g. alterations in TET2 in 20-30% of the patients, alterations in IL4 in up to 70% of the 
patients, alterations in IL13 in 80% of the patients, and alterations in KRAS in 10% of the patients; 
reviewed in (Molderings, 2015).  
The KIT D816V mutation was not found to be associated with survival in patients with mastocytosis 
(Lim, Tefferi, et al., 2009; Pardanani et al., 2016). Also, KIT D816V mutation burden does not 
correlate with the clinical manifestation of SM in a given individual, indicating that the combination of 
mutated genes could be the most relevant factor in terms of symptomatology (Molderings, 2015).  
In conclusion, 70-90% of patients with ASM harbour a KIT mutation. In MCL, the frequency of KIT 
mutations appears slightly lower, approximately 50% (Georgin-Lavialle et al., 2013). KIT mutations 
are therefore a key characteristic of SM and are considered a key driver in the aetiology and 
progression of the disease.  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
Acute myeloid leukaemia  
In AML, leukaemic blasts replace normal blood cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood, which leads 
to anaemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. This is associated with symptoms of fatigue,

EMA/CHMP/516229/2017 
Page 12/209 
  
  
 
shortness of breath, disturbed wound healing, infections and bleedings. If left untreated, AML results in 
death within a few weeks to months. 
The procedures used to diagnose and classify AML are: morphologic assessment of bone marrow 
specimens and blood smears (with ≥20% blasts in the bone marrow or peripheral blood being 
diagnostic of AML), analysis of the expression of cell-surface and cytoplasmic markers (by flow 
cytometry), identification of chromosomal findings (through cytogenetic testing), and screening for 
selected molecular genetic alterations. Currently, three molecular markers are used as part of standard 
clinical practice for risk stratification (European LeukemiaNet recommendations; (Dohner et al., 
2010)): Alterations in nucleophosmin-1 (NPM1); alternations in CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha 
(CEBPA); and alterations in Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3). 
Prognostic factors in AML can be subdivided into those that are related to the patient and those that 
are related to the disease. Patient-associated factors (e.g., increasing age, coexisting conditions, and 
poor performance status) commonly predict treatment-related early death, whereas disease-related 
factors (e.g., white-cell count, prior myelodysplastic syndrome or cytotoxic therapy for another 
disorder, and leukaemic-cell genetic changes including alterations in FLT3) predict resistance to current 
standard therapy. 
In this application the requested indication concerns patients with newly diagnosed AML who have FLT3 
mutated disease, defined as ≥5% mutated FLT3 alleles (internal tandem duplication or tyrosine kinase 
domain mutation) in AML blast cells, as determined by polymerase chain reaction. Patients positive for 
FLT3 alterations have a poorer prognosis compared to patients negative for FLT3 (Pemmaraju et al., 
2011). This concerns around 30% of patients with newly diagnosed AML.  
Overall, the 5-year survival rate for AML is 19%. The mortality rate strongly correlates with age: 5-
year survival rates are 3% to 8% in patients aged 60 years and older compared with 5-year survival 
rates of up to 50% for younger patients (Visser et al., 2012). In FLT3 mutated AML patients, the 
complete remission (CR) rate with standard first line induction chemotherapy regimens is generally 
equivalent to that of patients without FLT3 mutations (78% vs. 82%).  However the median time to 
relapse, disease free survival, event free survival and overall survival at 5 years is significantly worse 
(Gilliland & Griffin, 2002; Kottaridis et al., 2001; Schnittger et al., 2002; Thiede et al., 2002).On 
average, the median time to relapse for FLT3 mutated AML patients <60 years of age in first remission 
is estimated at approximately 9 months, compared to ~27 months for FLT3 WT AML patients <60 
years (Ciolli et al., 2004; Frohling et al., 2002; Kottaridis et al., 2001). 
ASM, SM-AHN, MCLPrognostic factors of overall survival (OS) in mastocytosis are WHO subtype, 
advanced age, history of weight loss, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, and excess bone 
marrow (BM) blasts (>5%) (Lim, Tefferi, et al., 2009).

Table 1. WHO classification of mastocytosis 
Systemic mastocytosis 
Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is mostly seen in adults and defined by multifocal histological lesions in 
the bone marrow (which is affected almost invariably) or other extracutaneous organs, together with 
cytological and biochemical signs of systemic disease. The diagnosis of SM is established if at least 1 
major and 1 minor or 3 minor of the following criteria are fulfilled (Valent et al., 2001):  
Major criteria 
•  Multifocal dense infiltrates of MC (>15 MC aggregating) detected in sections of BM and/or of 
other extracutaneous organ(s) by tryptase-immunohistochemistry or other stains 
Minor criteria  
• 
In MC infiltrates detected in sections of BM or other extracutaneous organs, >25% of MC are 
spindle-shaped, or: in BM smears, atypical MC (type I plus type II) comprise >25% of all MC  
•  KIT+ MCs in BM or blood or other extracutaneous organ(s) co-express CD2 or/and CD25 
•  Serum tryptase level >20 ng/ml (does not count in cases with an AHNMD) 
•  Detection of a KIT point mutation at codon 816 in BM or blood or other extracutaneous 
organ(s) 
SM is further divided into the following categories:  
- 
Indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) 
-  Smouldering systemic mastocytosis (SSM) 
-  SM with an associated clonal haematologic non-MC lineage disease (abbreviated SM-AHNMD or 
AHN, associated haematological neoplasm) 
-  Aggressive systemic mastocytosis  
-  MCL 
Aggressive systemic mastocytosis 
To determine the subtype of SM, a bone marrow biopsy, serum tryptase levels, complete blood counts 
with differential and liver function tests are typically performed. In addition to these assessments, the 
presence of “B” and “C findings” needs to be determined. The algorithm to define ASM and MCL is 
depicted in Figure 1. Because the application is focussed on ASM and MCL, the diagnosis of other 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/516229/2017 
Page 14/209 
  
  
 
 
 
subtypes of SM will not be discussed here. As shown in Figure 1, ASM must be associated with the 
presence of one or more C findings, i.e., findings related to organ function impairment due to 
excessive MC infiltration.  
Clinical findings are present in aggressive systemic mastocytosis and may be observed in MCL. These 
include cytopenias, palpable hepatomegaly with ascites and elevated liver function tests, palpable 
splenomegaly with hypersplenism, malabsorption due to MC infiltration of the intestinal tract with 
hypoalbuminemia and weight loss, and bone lesions with large osteolyses and/or severe osteoporosis 
with spontaneous and/or pathologic fractures. 
Mast cell leukaemia 
MCL is characterised by the presence of ≥20% MCs in a BM smear (Figure 1). Depending on whether 
there are ≥10% MCs in a peripheral blood smear or less than 10%, leukaemic MCL or aleukaemic MCL 
is diagnosed. Aleukaemic MCL is slightly more frequent than leukaemic MCL (~60% of cases; 
(Georgin-Lavialle et al., 2013).

Although AML was incurable 50 years ago, it is now cured in 35 to 40% of adult patients who are 60 
years of age or younger and in 5 to 15% of patients who are older than 60 years of age (Dohner et al., 
2010). Treatment of AML is with curative intent whenever possible. The general therapeutic strategy in 
patients with AML has not changed substantially in more than 30 years. In patients eligible for 
intensive induction chemotherapy, treatment consists of a combination of an anthracycline and 
continuous-infusion cytarabine in the classic ‘3+7’ regimen, i.e., 3 days of intravenous administration 
of an anthracycline, combined with 7 days of continuous intravenous cytarabine.  
If complete remission is achieved after intensive therapy, appropriate post-remission therapy is 
essential. There is no consensus on a single ‘best’ post-remission treatment, but it preferably includes 
intermediate or high-dose cytarabine-based chemotherapy, or consists of stem cell transplantation, 
depending on the risk group. Patients with good-risk AML should receive at least one cycle of intensive 
cytarabine-based consolidation chemotherapy. Patients with AML in intermediate and poor risk groups 
with an HLA-identical sibling may be candidates for allo-SCT, provided their age and performance 
status allow for such treatment. 
In the EU, recently approved agents include decitabine (Dacogen) is authorised for the treatment of 
adult patients with newly diagnosed de novo or secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), according 
to the World Health Organisation (WHO) classification, who are not candidates for standard induction 
chemotherapy. Azacitidine (Vidaza) is also authorised for the treatment of adult patients who are not 
eligible for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with: intermediate-2 and high-risk 
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) according to the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS); 
chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) with 10-29 % marrow blasts without myeloproliferative 
disorder, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with 20-30 % blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia, according to 
World Health Organisation (WHO) classification and AML with >30% marrow blasts according to the 
WHO classification. Finally, histamine dihydrochloride (Ceplene) is authorised for adult patients with 
AML in first remission concomitantly treated with interleukin-2 (IL-2).  
ASM, SM-AHN, MCLPatients with ASM, SM-AHN, or MCL have limited treatment options, and generally 
have a poor prognosis with a shortened life expectancy (Lim, Pardanani, Butterfield, Li, & Tefferi, 
2009). To date there are no approved standard therapies in the EU for ASM or MCL, but there are 
different therapies available which are commonly used in clinical practice (Ferrara & Schiffer, 2013; 
Ustun et al., 2016; Valent, Sperr, & Akin, 2010) 
About the product 
Midostaurin inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, including FLT3 and KIT kinase. Midostaurin 
inhibits FLT3 receptor signalling and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in leukaemic cells 
expressing FLT3 ITD or TKD mutant receptors or over expressing FLT3 wild type receptors. In vitro 
data indicate that midostaurin inhibits D816V mutant KIT receptors at exposure levels achieved in 
patients (average achieved exposure higher than IC50). In vitro data indicate that KIT wild type 
receptors are inhibited to a much lesser extent at these concentrations (average achieved exposure 
lower than IC50) (SmPC, section 5.1). 
The applicant requested the approval for the following indications:  
Rydapt is indicated 
• 
• 
in combination with standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy followed by single agent 
maintenance therapy for adult patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) who 
are FLT3 mutation-positive; 
for the treatment of adult patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis (advanced SM). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/516229/2017 
Page 17/209 
  
  
 
The final indications following CHMP review of this application is: 
Rydapt is indicated: 
• 
in combination with standard daunorubicin and cytarabine induction and high dose cytarabine 
consolidation chemotherapy, and for patients in complete response followed by Rydapt single agent 
maintenance therapy, for adult patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) who are 
FLT3 mutation positive; 
• 
as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with aggressive systemic mastocytosis 
(ASM), systemic mastocytosis with associated haematological neoplasm (SM AHN), or mast cell 
leukaemia (MCL) (SmPC,  section 4.1). 
For AML the recommended dose of Rydapt is 50 mg twice daily. Rydapt is dosed on days 8 21 of 
induction and consolidation chemotherapy cycles, and then for patients in complete response every 
day as single agent maintenance therapy until relapse for up to 12 cycles of 28 days each (SmPC, 
section 4.2). 
For the advanced SM indication, the recommended starting dose of Rydapt is 100 mg twice daily. 
Treatment should be continued as long as clinical benefit is observed or until unacceptable toxicity 
occurs (SmPC, section 4.2). 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the fact that the provided data 
indicated that more patients obtained a CR in the midostaurin-treated arm when compared to placebo, 
and it was shown that patients treated with midostaurin up to receiving SCT in CR1 had an OS benefit 
relative to patients who were transplanted in CR1 and were treated with placebo up to SCT. Thus, this 
indicated a lost chance for patients diagnosed with AML who do not receive midostaurin in first-line, 
which would justify the claim of major public health interest. 
However, during assessment the CHMP concluded that it was no longer appropriate to pursue 
accelerated assessment, since major objections had been identified, which precluded an accelerated 
assessment.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of midostaurin is N-[(2S,3R,4R,6R)-3-methoxy-2-methyl-16-oxo-29-oxa-1,7,17-
triaza-octacyclo [12.12.2.12,6.07,28.08,13.015,19.020,27.021,26] nonacosa-8,10,12,14,19,21,23,25,27-
nonaen-4-yl]-N-methylbenzamide corresponding to the molecular formula C35H30N4O4. It has a relative 
molecular mass of 570.65 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 4. Structure of midostaurin 
The chemical structure of midostaurin was inferred from the route of synthesis and confirmed by a 
combination of 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental 
analysis, infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography. The solid state 
properties of the active substance were measured by differential scanning calorimetry, 
thermogravimetric analysis and x-ray powder diffraction. 
The active substance is a white to light yellow or light green slightly hygroscopic crystalline powder. 
Due to its lipophilic properties, lack of ionisable moieties and planar structure, it is highly insoluble in 
aqueous media irrespective of pH but shows increased solubility in less polar alcohols and polar aprotic 
solvents. As a result of these properties, the active substance is dissolved in a combination of liquid 
excipients, inside a capsule, which self-emulsify on dissolution in aqueous media. 
Midostaurin exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of four chiral centres. Enantiomeric purity is 
controlled routinely by specific optical rotation of the active substance. 
Polymorphism has been observed for midostaurin and the correct physical form is ensured by the 
crystallisation process. Since the active substance is dissolved during formulation, physicochemical 
properties are mostly relevant to the isolation and stability of the active substance. 
Midostaurin is considered to be a new active substance. The applicant demonstrated that neither it, nor 
its derivatives and salts have ever been active substances in products authorised in Europe. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Midostaurin is synthesized in two main steps followed by crystallisation and milling. The first step is a 
fermentation process carried out by one manufacturer, with the working cell bank considered to be the 
source material and starting point of manufacture. Suitable specifications and detailed characterisation 
data have been provided. A master cell bank has been established in order to preserve the production 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/516229/2017 
Page 19/209 
  
  
 
 
strain and product working cell banks as needed. The microorganism is not genetically modified and is 
non-toxic and non-pathogenic. 
A second manufacturer carries out the subsequent purification of staurosporine, benzoylation and 
recrystallization processes with the milling step carried out by a third manufacturer.  
The fermentation step is described in detail with input materials and reaction parameters for both 
propagation and production steps defined. The process for harvest and subsequent purification is also 
defined as per the Ph. Eur. monograph on products of fermentation. Methods for inactivation and 
removal of biomass are defined, along with in process controls to ensure removal. Adequate in-process 
controls are applied during the chemical synthesis process. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products and reagents have been presented. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterised. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development program. The main change was from the amorphous active substance used in 
early development to the crystalline active substance used in later clinical studies. Otherwise, only 
minor changes to the process have been made resulting in improvements to the quality of the active 
substance. 
The active substance is packaged in polyethylene (PE) bags which comply with the Regulation No 
10/2011 as amended, as well as the Ph. Eur. monograph on polyolefins. The bags are placed in 
additional PE bags which are stored in drums. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR, XRPD), specific optical 
rotation, colour and clarity of solution (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents 
(GC), water content (KF), heavy metals (ICP-OES), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), particle size 
distribution (laser diffraction) and microbial enumeration (Ph. Eur.). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. Mutagenic impurities 
have been shown to be purged to well below the TTC levels in the active substance by way of spiking 
studies and so no limits are included in the specification. Control of elemental impurities is in line with 
ICH Q3D – no elemental impurity has been observed above 30% of the PDE in the tested batches. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from 26 pilot to production scale batches of the active substance manufactured via 
the intended commercial process (or earlier minor variations thereof) and used in clinical, toxicological 
and stability studies were provided. The results were within the specifications and consistent from 
batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from six pilot scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturers using 
minor variations of the process stored in the intended commercial package stored for up to 60 months 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/516229/2017 
Page 20/209 
  
  
 
under long term (25 ºC / 60% RH) and intermediate (30 ºC / 75% RH) conditions and for up to 6 
months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
In addition, stability studies using 3 production scale batches have been instigated and data after 12 
months under intermediate conditions and 6 months under accelerated conditions is available. Studies 
on these batches will be continued up to the end of the proposed retest period. Batches were tested for 
appearance, identity, specific optical rotation, colour and clarity of solution, assay, impurities and 
water content. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and are stability indicating. 
No significant trends to any of the measured parameters were observed and batches complied with the 
specification at every time point. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. Significant 
degradation occurred so midostaurin is to be protected from exposure to light. 
Stress testing in the solid state shows that midostaurin is not sensitive to moisture, oxygen and heat 
up to 100 oC although it does show reversible uptake of a small amount of water. Forced degradation 
studies in aqueous solution show that midostaurin is inert to acid and base. Minor degradation was 
observed on exposure to hydrogen peroxide and light. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 60 months stored not 
above 30 oC in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Rydapt is presented as orange soft gelatin capsules containing 25 mg midostaurin dissolved in the 
liquid contents. The capsules are packaged in PA/Al/PVC-Al blisters.  
Midostaurin is poorly soluble in aqueous media but highly permeable (BCS class II). Initial studies 
showed midostaurin to be poorly bioavailable when dosed orally. The aim of development therefore 
was to find a stable dosage form which would allow midostaurin to be delivered orally and in solution 
so as to be bioavailable without a rate-limiting dissolution step. The active substance is dissolved in a 
mixture of lipophilic and hydrophilic solvents with a surfactant such that a micro-emulsion is formed 
spontaneously on addition to aqueous media without it precipitating. The fill solution is encapsulated 
within a soft gelatin capsule for ease of administration. 
The selection of excipients for the fill solution was based on the solubility and stability of midostaurin in 
the individual and combined excipients and its ability to spontaneously form a micro-emulsion on 
addition to water. The fill solution is a mixture of corn oil mono-di-triglycerides, macrogolglycerol 
hydroxystearate, macrogol 400, ethanol and all-rac-α-tocopherol and was shown to form a 
homogeneous solution with the active substance. The inclusion of an anti-oxidant is justified and the 
amount added has been optimised to adequately control oxidative degradation. Equilibrium solubility 
studies were carried out to show that midostaurin remains in solution and no phase separation occurs 
under the manufacturing and storage conditions and that no precipitation occurs on addition to 
aqueous media. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant 
with Ph. Eur. standards where applicable. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product 
formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.2.1 of this 
report. 
Drug substance release rate was expected to depend on disintegration time of the capsule since 
midostaurin is already in solution and thus doesn’t need to dissolve. Media pH and apparatus were 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/516229/2017 
Page 21/209 
  
  
 
investigated for development of a discriminatory dissolution method. The method is considered to be 
discriminatory since it detects batches which fail to disintegrate adequately. 
The proposed commercial formulation was used during phase 1-3 clinical studies. However, earlier 
clinical studies used a different soft capsule formulation, hard capsules and an oral solution. Relative 
bioavailability or bioequivalence was demonstrated on each shift between formulations as appropriate. 
The  primary  packaging  is  PA/Al/PVC-Al  blisters.  The  material  complies  with  Ph.  Eur.  and  EC 
requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of four main steps: preparation of the fill solution; preparation of 
the gelatin mass; encapsulation followed by washing and drying; imprinting. The process is considered 
to be a standard manufacturing process.  
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated on three consecutive production scale 
batches of finished product. The process parameters to control the preparation of the fill solution have 
been shown to be robust. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of 
producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The IPCs used to test the 
fill solution, gel mass, and filled capsules are adequate. Holding times and storage conditions for 
intermediates have been defined and justified. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form 
including  appearance  (contents  and  shell),  appearance  by  light  microscopy,  identity  (HPLC  and  UV), 
identity  and  assay  of  antioxidant  (HPLC),  identity  and  assay  of  ethanol  (GC),  appearance  in  water, 
droplet size (laser light scattering), disintegration time (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (UV), water content (KF), 
degradation products (HPLC), microbial enumeration (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), 
and assay (HPLC). 
Since the performance of the finished product depends on midostaurin being dissolved in the fill 
solution, the capsules rupturing on oral administration, and the contents emulsifying on contact with 
gastrointestinal fluid, controls are included in the specification which test these attributes. 
Disintegration time is measured to ensure rapid release of the drug. The capsule contents are 
examined by light microscopy to detect midostaurin precipitation or phase separation. Visual 
appearance on dilution and emulsion droplet size are also checked to ensure midostaurin remains in 
solution and a sufficiently fine micro-emulsion is formed. Specified impurities are either metabolites or 
degradation products and have been toxicologically qualified at the levels indicated. 
The colourants are tested for identity before use and the colour of the final gelatin mass is checked as 
an IPC. Therefore, no test for colourants is included in the specification. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 9 representative production scale batches confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification.

Stability of the product 
Stability  studies  were  carried  out  on  8  production  scale  batches  stored  in  various  blister  packs  made 
from the same PA/Al/PVC forming component but with 3 separate backing component materials under 
6 sets of conditions: -20 oC / ambient humidity; 5 oC / ambient humidity; 25 oC / 60% RH (long term 
conditions); 30 oC / 75% RH (intermediate conditions); 40 oC / 75% RH and 50 oC / ambient humidity. 
Three  batches  were  stored  in  blisters  backed  with  PET/Al/vinyl  based  heat-sealed  lacquer  (blister  1), 
two in blisters backed with Al/vinyl based heat-sealed lacquer (blister 2), and three in blisters backed 
with  the  proposed  commercial  material  Al/acryl-vinyl  based  heat-sealed  lacquer  (blister  3).  Batches 
were tested for appearance (shell and contents), appearance by light microscopy, appearance in water, 
disintegration  time,  assay  of  antioxidant,  assay  of  ethanol,  droplet  size,  dissolution,  water  content, 
degradation products, microbial enumeration, and assay of midostaurin.

conditions  showed  no  significant  changes  to  any  of  the  measured  parameters  were  observed,  other 
than a minor increase in one impurity. After storage for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions, 
an  increase  in  impurities  and  decrease  in  antioxidant  content  was  observed.  However,  all  measured 
parameters  remained  within  their  specification  limits.  Similar  trends  were  observed  for  2  batches 
stored  in  blister  2  for  up  to  36  months  under  long  term  and  intermediate  conditions  and  for  up  to  6 
months under accelerated conditions, and for 3 batches stored in proposed commercial blister 3 for up 
to 18 months under long term and intermediate conditions and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions. The three packaging configurations are therefore considered equivalent. 
Batches stored at 50 °C for 1 month showed slight deformation of the capsule but no changes to any 
other measured parameters. No changes were observed for batches stored under the colder conditions 
and  subjected  to  freeze/thaw  cycles,  showing  that  refrigeration  and  freezing  have  no  detrimental 
impact on quality. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New  Drug  Substances  and  Products.  All  tested  parameters  remained  within  their  specification  limits 
indicating that Rydapt is not photosensitive. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 3 years without special storage conditions 
as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable.

Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
All the pivotal preclinical safety studies were conducted in compliance with GLP. Dose range finding 
studies do not all claim GLP compliance, but were conducted in a GLP-compliant facility. Except for the 
hERG channel tests for both major metabolites of midostaurin, safety pharmacology studies were not 
performed according to GLP. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro studies 
Activity of midostaurin against purified kinase isoforms (RD-2008-01357) 
Midostaurin was tested at a concentration of 1 μM in replicate against 220 purified kinases. Values of 
≥80% inhibition were observed for 12 kinases with 1 µM midostaurin. For these 12 kinases and a 
selected group of enzymes (based on their drug-sensitivity and their sequence similarity) IC50 
determinations were performed. The IC50 against wild-type FLT3 and the mutated FLT3 D835Y kinase 
was determined as 19.8 and 3.64 nM, respectively.   
Activity of midostaurin against wild-type KIT and other purified kinase isoforms (Fabbro et al, 2000, 
and PKF-98-02545) 
Inhibition of wild-type KIT, various protein kinase C isoforms and other kinases were investigated using 
several different methods including incorporation of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP. Anti-kinase activity with IC50 
values below 1 μM for midostaurin was reported against wild-type KIT, the conventional PKC isoforms, 
PPK, the src-family kinase SYK and the proangiogenic kinase KDR (VEGFR2).  
Binding affinity of midostaurin for purified kinases and kinase domains (Karaman et al, 2008) 
Dissociation constants for more than 180 purified kinases or kinase domains were determined by 
competition binding assays using immobilized midostaurin. The affinity constant of midostaurin was 
below 100 nM for 36 of the kinases. Oncogenic FLT3 mutants and KIT mutants ranked among the 
kinases for which midostaurin had the highest affinity. 
Inhibition of FLT3 mutated AML cell proliferation (RD-2004-01878; Grundler, 2003)

The murine pro-B cell line BaF3 expresses FLT3 mutations implicated in AML (Grundler et al 2003). 
Midostaurin inhibited the cell growth of both FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD mutants at nanomolar 
concentrations. 
In a follow-up study, midostaurin was tested in proliferation assays using human AML cell lines 
expressing mutant or wild-type FLT3 (RD-2004-01878). Some of these cell lines harboured additional 
mutations in oncogenes or were growth factor dependent.  Midostaurin inhibited the two FLT3-ITD 
dependent AML cell lines MV4-11 and MOLM13. In addition, midostaurin inhibited the proliferation of 
FIP1L-PDGFR expressing eosinophilic cell line EOL1. Midostaurin did not show significant inhibition of 
proliferation in the FLT3-ITD expressing human pro-myelocytic leukaemia cell line PL21. The mean IC50 
values obtained for midostaurin in various leukaemia cell lines are shown in Table 4 together with the 
respective growth factor information. 
Table 2: Inhibition of cell proliferation by midostaurin in various leukaemia cell lines 
The anti-proliferative activity of midostaurin in MV4-11 cells has also been investigated by other 
groups, resulting in IC50 values ranging from 12 to 35 nM (Furukawa et al 2007; Ogderel et al 2008; 
Zarrinkar et al 2009). 
Cytotoxic response of midostaurin and CGP52421 on primary AML mononuclear cells (MNCs) 
expressing wild-type or mutated FLT3 (Knapper, 2006; Levis, 2006) 
Cytotoxicity assays were conducted using cryopreserved primary AML MNCs obtained from the bone 
marrow and blood of 96 newly diagnosed AML patients (Knapper et al 2006). In this study, the IC50 
values were significantly higher than observed in studies using leukaemia cell lines, and ranged from 1 
to 10 µM. Cytotoxic responses were highly heterogeneous, and FLT3 mutation status was found to 
have no significant effect on the cytotoxicity response. Further, it was found that variations in FLT3 
expression level had little impact on the in vitro sensitivity to midostaurin. The cytotoxic response of 
midostaurin in combination with cytarabine was also investigated. The results showed that there was 
Assessment report

no statistical evidence to support synergy in any of the FLT3 mutational subpopulations treated with 
the midostaurin/cytarabine combination. 
In another similar study, the cytotoxicity of midostaurin was also investigated using primary AML 
samples isolated from patients (Levis, 2006). Midostaurin (100 nM) induced virtually no cytotoxicity in 
the FLT3 wild-type AML samples and only a modest effect in the FLT/ITD mutant samples (Table 5). 
Following up these results, five samples were selected and investigated for cytotoxicity in response to 
both midostaurin and CGP52421, one of the main metabolites of midostaurin. Over the dose range 100 
to 500 nM CGP52421 was more cytotoxic than midostaurin. When midostaurin and CGP52421 were 
combined in the cytotoxic assay, there was no difference in effect with CGP52421 alone as compared 
with the combination. Thus, in this assay CGP52421 was more cytotoxic to AML blasts than its parent 
compound, midostaurin.

Inhibition of proliferation of mast cell lines and primary mast cells expressing mutant KIT (Growney, 
2005; Gleixner, 2006) 
Midostaurin was tested against 14 different KIT mutations associated with human malignancies (AML, 
systemic mast cell disease and gastrointestinal stromal tumours) in the murine hematopoietic cell line 
BaF3 (Growney et al 2005).  KIT D816Y and D816V expressing cells were sensitive to midostaurin 
despite resistance to imatinib mesylate. In these cells, midostaurin, but not imatinib mesylate, 
inhibited auto-phosphorylation of c-KIT and activation of downstream effectors signal transducer and 
transcriptional activator (Stat) 3 and 5. 
In another study, the human mast cell lines HMC-1.1 and HMC-1.2 were used to analyse the inhibitory 
effects of midostaurin on KIT receptor phosphorylation and cell proliferation (Gleixner et al 2006). 
HMC-1.1 express the V560G mutation, while HMC-1.2 express both D816V and V560 mutations. Total 
inhibition of receptor phosphorylation was observed with 1 μM midostaurin in both cell lines, while IC50 
values for anti-proliferative effects by midostaurin ranged from 50 to 250 nM. 
The anti-proliferative activity of midostaurin was also tested in primary mast cells from a single patient 
harbouring smouldering systemic mastocytosis (SSM). This culture contained mostly imatinib resistant 
D816V positive cells. In this culture, the IC50 value for midostaurin was close to 50 nM (Gleixner et al 
2006). 
Induction of apoptosis in AML and ASM cell lines (Armstrong, 2003; Odgerel, 2008; Nordigarden, 
2009; Gleixner, 2006) 
Treatment with 500 nM midostaurin resulted in marked induction of apoptosis measured by Annexin V 
staining in FLT3-ITD expressing (MV4-11) or wild-type FLT3 overexpressing (SEMK2-M1) AML cell lines 
(Armstrong et al 2003). 
In another study, treatment with 100 nM midostaurin resulted in marked induction of apoptosis 
measured by detecting DNA fragmentation using a TUNEL assay in FLT3-ITD expressing MV4-11 AML 
cell line (Odgerel et al 2008). 
To analyse the mechanism of midostaurin to induce apoptosis at the level of Bim and Puma genes, 
both of which are regulators of apoptosis, mononuclear cells from several AML patients with FLT3-ITD 
mutations were exposed to midostaurin (100 and 300 nM) (Nordigarden et al 2009). AML cells from 
four patients were responsive to midostaurin and showed a decrease in numbers of viable cells after 72 
Assessment report

hours. Real-time PCR analysis demonstrated a significant up-regulation of Bim and Puma after 24 
hours of midostaurin treatment, ranging from a 1.3- to 4.7-fold increase compared with no treatment. 
The pro-apoptotic effects of midostaurin were also analysed in cell models of ASM (Gleixner et al 
2006). Treatment with midostaurin resulted in marked induction of apoptosis determined by 
PI/Annexin V staining in KIT D816V expressing human mast cell line HMC-1.2. Using electron 
microscopy, HMC-1.2 cells cultured with midostaurin frequently displayed signs of apoptosis including 
cell shrinkage, membrane ruffling, vacuolization, and condensation of the nuclear chromatin. 
Mechanism of synergistic activity of midostaurin (Seedhouse, 2006) 
DNA repair was investigated in FLT3-ITD and FLT3 wild-type cells (Seedhouse et al, 2006). Using the 
comet assay, it was observed that midostaurin significantly inhibited repair of DNA damage in the 
FLT3-ITD expressing MV4-11 cell line and FLT3-ITD patient samples, but not the FLT3 wild-type cells. 
The reduction in DNA repair in midostaurin-treated FLT3-ITD cells was shown to be associated with 
downregulation of RAD51 mRNA and protein expression, and correlated with the maintenance of 
phosphorylated H2AX levels, implying that midostaurin inhibits the homologous recombination double-
strand break repair pathway in FLT3-ITD cells. This suggested that midostaurin may reverse the drug-
resistant phenotype of FLT3-ITD-AML cells by inhibiting repair of chemotherapy-induced genotoxic 
damage. 
Effect of midostaurin in combination with other drugs in ASM cell lines (Gleixner, 2006) 
In order to determine if addition of midostaurin to other drugs result in enhanced efficacy, midostaurin 
plus several TKI or standard of care agents were assessed in the human mast cell line HMC-1 by a 3H-
thymidine uptake (Gleixner et al 2006). Midostaurin was found to cooperate with AMN107 (a novel TK 
targeting drug), imatinib, and cladribine in producing growth inhibition of HMC-1. However, clear 
synergistic drug interaction were only observed with the V560G mutant expressing HMC-1.1 cell 
variant, while the synergetic drug interaction was weak in the D816V / V560G mutant expressing HMC-
1.2 cells. 
Biological activity in presence of plasma (PKF-98-02553) 
In an initial study, a reduction in the midostaurin-mediated inhibition of PKC-α activity by 
approximately one order of magnitude was found in the presence of 10% human plasma. This effect 
was specific to human plasma, since neither mouse, rat nor porcine plasma had any effect on the 
potency of midostaurin to inhibit PKC- α. Additional studies revealed that the human plasma proteins 
responsible for this effect is most likely the α-1 acidic glycoprotein (AAG), followed bv α-1-anti-trypsin 
and albumin. In fact, in the presence of 1.0 mg/ml of human AAG corresponding to 20 µM (the normal 
circulating levels of AAG in human plasma) the IC50 for inhibition of PKC-α in vitro was shifted by two 
orders of magnitude. A similar shift in IC50 for the anti-proliferative effects of midostaurin against 
human bladder carcinoma T24, epidermoid carcinoma A431 and colon carcinoma HCT-116 cells was 
observed in the presence of human AAG. No effect was observed when performed in the presence of 
1.0 mg/ml of rat AAG.  
Analysis of free drug activity ex vivo by plasma inhibitory assay (Levis, 2006) 
The pharmacodynamic activity of plasma samples from midostaurin-treated AML patients were 
analysed in an ex vivo reporter assay. In this study, midostaurin had >100 fold less biological activity 
in plasma compared to medium. This effect is likely related to binding of midostaurin to plasma 
proteins leading to a reduction of the pharmacologically active free fraction. However, inhibition of 
target phosphorylation was demonstrated using plasma form midostaurin treated patients.  
Pharmacological profile of the major metabolites of midostaurin (RD-2008-01357; RDS-2015-00401; 
Zarrinkar, 2009; Karaman, 2008; Levis, 2006; Peter, 2015)  
Assessment report

In humans, midostaurin is rapidly transformed to mainly two major metabolites - the 7-hydroxy-
derivate CGP52421, which consists of two epimers, and O-demethylation product CGP62221. The 
biological activity of both metabolites was analysed to explore if they can contribute to the 
pharmacological activity of the parent compound. In general, the metabolite CGP62221 showed on 
target potencies in the biological assays similar to that of midostaurin. CGP52421, showed potencies 
that were up to one log weaker compared to those of midostaurin. The 7-hydroxy-derivate CGP52421 
exists in two epimeric forms which were found to display similar biological activities in cell based 
assays (RDS-2015-00401). 
Inhibition of receptor auto-phosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation in FLT3 dependent cell 
systems (Barry, 2007; Weisberg, 2008)  
The effect of midostaurin on FLT3 auto-phosphorylation, STAT5 and ERK phosphorylation was tested in 
murine BaF3 cells (Barry et al 2007, Weisberg et al 2008). The cells expressed several constitutively 
active oncogenic FLT3 mutants which had been identified in AML patients. These encompassed FLT3-
ITD (internal tandem duplication) as well as FLT3-TKD (tyrosine kinase domain) mutants. The 
activation loop mutations were all identified in AML patients but with different frequencies and different 
transforming potential. The most prevalent being the D835V mutation. Midostaurin inhibited 
phosphorylation of the FLT3 receptor, and its downstream targets STAT5 and ERK in a dose-dependent 
manner. Reduction of the phospho-signal was observed at midostaurin concentrations of 30 nM for the 
FLT3-ITD mutant and 100 nM for the FLT3-TKD mutants. 
Inhibition of receptor auto-phosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation in AML cell systems 
(Odgerel, 2008; Armstrong, 2003; George, 2004; Knapper, 2006) 
Midostaurin inhibited FLT3, STAT5, ERK and AKT phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent 
manner. These results indicated that midostaurin inhibits the activity of the FLT3 signalling pathway in 
AML cells (Odgerel et al 2008, Armstrong et al 2003, George et al 2004). The pharmacodynamic 
activity of midostaurin was also determined in primary mononuclear cells from AML patients with FLT3 
mutants or FLT3 wild-type status (Knapper et al 2006). Midostaurin inhibited the phosphorylation of 
the FLT3 receptor at concentrations similar to those observed in non-patient-derived cell lines. Similar 
results were reported for bone marrow derived mononuclear cells from AML patients with wild-type or 
mutated FLT3 receptor status (Odgerel et al 2008).  
Inhibition of receptor auto-phosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation in KIT dependent cell 
systems (Growney, 2005; Gleixner, 2006; Lee, 2011)  
In SM the KIT receptor is frequently mutated and constitutively activated in a ligand-independent 
fashion. Murine BaF3 cells, which express several constitutively active oncogenic KIT mutants seen in 
SM patients, were used to assess the pharmacodynamic effect of midostaurin and to determine its 
effects on KIT auto-phosphorylation and STAT5 phosphorylation (Growney et al 2005). The results 
from this study showed that the phospho-signal was reduced at midostaurin concentrations of 10-50 
nM. 
In another study, the human mast cell lines HMC-1.1 and HMC1.2 were used to analyse the inhibitory 
effects of midostaurin on KIT receptor phosphorylation and proliferation (Gleixner et al 2006). Total 
inhibition of receptor phosphorylation was observed with 1 μM midostaurin in both cell lines. 
One assay was performed using antibodies recognizing either phosphorylated forms of KIT-D816V or 
KIT-D816Y (Gleixner et al 2006). Midostaurin fully inhibited KIT-D816V phosphorylation at 1 μM, while 
imatinib was ineffective and nilotinib (AMN107) was only partially effective. Similar results were 
reported for KIT-D816V receptor phosphorylation and MITF expression by (Lee et al 2011).

In vivo studies 
Anti-tumour activity of midostaurin against FLT3-ITD expressing MV4-11 cells in the s.c. xenograft 
model (RD-2014-00163) 
The anti-proliferative activity of midostaurin against s.c. implanted human acute myeloid leukaemia 
FLT3-ITD expressing MV4-11 cells (5x106 cells/200µl) was investigated in female athymic nude mice. 
Ten days after inoculation, treatment was started with midostaurin at a daily p.o. dose of 5, 20, 50 and 
150 mg/kg/10 ml. Treatment with 5 and 20 mg/kg of midostaurin resulted in reduced tumour growth 
throughout the experiment with a final % T/C of 53 and 42 respectively. This difference was not 
statistically significant. Whereas oral doses of 50 and 150 mg/kg resulted in a significant dose-
dependent tumour regression throughout the experiment with final regressions of 58% and 100%, 
respectively. The anti-tumour activity was observed with doses which did not yield significant changes 
of body weight. However, one animal died in the group treated at 150 mg/kg. The cause of death is 
not stated in the study report. 
Anti-leukemic activity of midostaurin in the bone marrow transplantation (BMT) model (Weisberg, 
2002) 
The in vivo anti-leukemic activity of midostaurin was investigated in Balb/c mice transplanted with 
murine bone marrow cells expressing FLT3-ITD (Weisberg et al 2002). This model is established at 
approximately 30 days post transplantation. Midostaurin or placebo (n=22/group) were dosed orally 
from day 30 to day 88 in trial 1 and from day 25 to day 68 in trial 2. Data collected included total and 
differential white blood cell counts, gross morphological features, and spleen weight. Organs from all 
animals were fixated and analysed for histological features of disease. The immune-phenotype of 
spleen cells of four animals from each group was also analysed. Midostaurin resulted in significant 
survival benefit versus placebo treated controls in two separate experiments (p < 0.005 and 0.009; log 
rank test). Mean spleen weight (401 mg) was significantly higher for placebo animals compared to 
midostaurin-treated mice (80 mg). Similarly, the mean white blood cell count for placebo animals was 
25.8 × 106 /ml compared to 3.6 × 106 /ml for drug-treated animals. Histopathologic examination of 
the spleen showed that splenic architecture was effaced in the placebo mice by a marked expansion of 
red pulp comprised of maturing myeloid cells and scattered admixed megakaryocytes. The spleen 
displayed marked hyper-cellularity and myeloid hyperplasia consisting predominantly of mature 
granulocytic elements. In contrast, the drug-treated animals showed a partial recovery of splenic 
architecture, a reduction in myeloid hyperplasia, and a corresponding increase in the proportion of 
other hematopoietic lineages. 
Drug levels in midostaurin-treated animals were analysed in selected animals at trial end. Blood 
samples were obtained from six mice sacrificed 8–12 hr after dosing, and showed mean concentrations 
of 0.954 μM, well above the in vitro anti-proliferative concentration range. 
Anti-leukemic activity of midostaurin in a FLT3-ITD transgenic mouse model (Weisberg, 2008) 
To investigate further the in vivo antitumor efficacy of midostaurin, a mouse model of acute leukaemia 
in which tumour burden was quantified by non-invasive imaging of luminescent leukemic cells was 
applied.  Taconic Line NCr nude mice were inoculated with FLT3-ITD-BaF3 cells engineered to stably 
express firefly luciferase. Non-invasive imaging was used to assess leukemic burden, and mice with 
established leukaemia were divided into cohorts with similar disease burden. Midostaurin administered 
orally at a dose of 100 mg/kg, once daily was able to suppressed leukaemia burden in mice compared 
with vehicle-treated controls.  
Therapeutic activity of midostaurin in a FLT3-ITD transgenic mouse model yielding B- or T-lymphoid 
disease (Lee, 2005) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/516229/2017 
Page 29/209 
  
  
 
Midostaurin was also studied in a transgenic mouse model in which FLT3-ITD was expressed under the 
control of the vav hematopoietic promoter. Most vav-FLT3-ITD transgenic mice developed a 
myeloproliferative disease (MPD) with high penetrance. A clonal immature B- or T-lymphoid disease 
was observed in two additional founder mice, respectively, that could be secondarily transplanted to 
recipient mice that rapidly developed lymphoid disease. Treatment of these mice with midostaurin 
resulted in suppression of disease and a statistically significant prolongation of survival. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic were submitted. Possible additional modes of action by midostaurin 
which were described in literature, including inhibition of anti-IgE-induced release of histamine in 
basophils and mast cells reversion of Pgp mediated multi drug resistance were presented. Midostaurin 
inhibits anti-IgE-induced release of histamine in basophils and mast cells at pharmacological 
concentrations, which can be of clinical importance in ASM/SM-AHN/MCL patients who are candidates 
for targeted drug therapy (Krauth, 2009). Reversion of Pgp mediated multi-drug resistance (MDR) by 
midostaurin can be caused by overexpression of Pgp (p-glycoprotein). Midostaurin has been found to 
revert the Pgp-mediated MDR phenotype by inhibiting the function of Pgp. A pro-apoptotic activity of 
midostaurin against both mutated and non-FLT3-mutated AML blast cells with Pgp expression was 
observed (Utz, 1998; Hunter, 2004). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
In vitro neurotransmitter effects in rat brain slices and brain homogenate (PKF 90-02620, non-GLP): 
The effect of 10 µmol/L midostaurin on neurotransmitter release, 10 and 100 µmol/L midostaurin on 
neurotransmitter uptake and 1 mM midostaurin on phosphatidylinositol turnover was investigated in 
rat pre-labeled brain slices or brain homogenate. At 10 µmol/L [3H]noradrenaline (NA), [3H]serotonin 
(5-HT) and [3H]-dopamine (DA) were marginally decreased, whereas [3H]GABA and [3H]acetylcholine 
(ACh) were not affected. Midostaurin moderately inhibited (19%) the basal release of [3H]GABA at 10 
µM and caused weak inhibition of uptake of [3H]NA, [3H]5-HT and [3H]GABA at 100 µM in rat mid 
brain synaptosomes. In addition, at 1mM midostaurin had no effect on the activity of 1,4,5-
triphosphate 5-phosphatase and inositol monophosphate phosphatase.  
In vivo CNS observation test, rotarod test, potentiation of ethanol-induced narcosis and motility in 
mice (PKF 90-02621, non-GLP): 
Male Tif:MAGf (SPF) mice were exposed to 10, 30, 100, 300 or 1000 mg/kg midostaurin orally (n=4). 
Mice were observed up to 24 hours and behavioural alterations were scored. A marginal increase in 
ataxia was observed at 10-1000 mg/kg orally at 0.5-4 hours after exposure. In the rotarod assay, no 
significant differences were observed compared to control. At two hours after exposure, body 
temperature was significantly increased at 10 mg/kg and higher, which may be indicative of a potential 
CNS effect. Midostaurin did not have an effect on potentiation of ethanol induced narcosis. Finally, 
midostaurin did not have an effect on motility. Overall, midostaurin did not induce prominent 
behavioural alterations. 
In vitro electrophysiology studies (Studies 0250111 (non-GLP), 0770504 (GLP), 0770505, (GLP)): 
The effect of 12 µM midostaurin on hERG channel current expressed in HEK293 cells was tested using 
patch-clamp. Exposure to midostaurin resulted in an hERG tail current inhibition of 1.2%. Due to 
solubility of midostaurin, 12 µM was the highest feasible dose.

The effect of 0.34, 1.5 and 4.74 µM CGP52421 on hERG channel current expressed in HEK293 cells 
was tested using patch-clamp. Statistically significant inhibition of the hERG current was 16.5%, 
38.5% and 26.4% at 0.34, 1.5 and 4.74 µM, respectively. The effect of 1.21 µM CGP62221 on hERG 
channel current expressed in HEK293 cells was tested using patch-clamp. Exposure to CGP62221 
resulted in an hERG tail current inhibition of 11.3%. Due to solubility of CGP62221, 1.21 µM was the 
highest feasible dose.  
The highest predicted total concentration of midostaurin, CGP52421 and CGP62221 in patients 
receiving 100 mg b.i.d of midostaurin was 8.7 µM (fu=0.087 µM), 4.8 µM (fu=0.048 µM) and 5.9 μM 
(fu=0.059 µM) respectively. The highest concentrations tested in-vitro in the hERG assay were 
approximately 138, 31 and 21-fold higher than highest concentrations (fu) of midostaurin, CGP52421 
and CGP62221 in patients, respectively.  
Additional in vitro cardiovascular studies in isolated organs (PKF-90-02622, non-GLP): 
In isolated guinea-pig atria, midostaurin applied in single concentrations of 0.18, 1.8 and 18 μM had no 
consistent effects on either the force or the rate of contraction. In isolated perfused mesenteric 
vascular beds of the rat, midostaurin at 0.18 -18 μM produced concentration dependent inhibition of 
both noradrenaline and potassium chloride induced vasoconstriction (IC50’s: 0.67 and 0.41 μM) 
suggesting relaxant effects which may partly explain the decreased blood pressure effects in rats at 
high intravenous doses. Midostaurin (1-30 μM) had no relaxant effects in isolated rabbit thoracic aorta 
rings pre-constricted with noradrenaline and angiotensin II.  
In vivo cardiovascular and renal study in rats (PKF 90-02622, non-GLP): 
Male rats (Tif:RAIf, SPF) were exposed for thirty minutes to 3, 8 or 25 mg/kg (0.10, 0.27, and 0.83 
mg/kg/min) midostaurin intravenously or 300 mg/kg orally. Thirty minute infusions of 8 and 25 mg/kg 
decreased mean arterial pressure (31-47%) and heart rate (18-21%). Infusion of 2.5 mg/kg/min in 
rats induced severe hypotension and respiratory arrest and was lethal after 14 to 21 minutes of 
infusion (after total doses of 35-53 mg/kg).  The oral dose of 300 mg/kg midostaurin had no effects on 
mean arterial pressure and heart rate during the 6-hour observation period. Oral administration of 
midostaurin (30 to 300 mg/kg) increased sodium and chloride excretion by about 100% and 50% 
respectively at doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg with no effects on urine volume or potassium excretion 
suggesting weak diuretic effects. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Anti-proliferative activity of midostaurin was tested in combination with standard of care agents in the 
MOLM13 cell line by a resazurin based assay. Midostaurin was tested in fixed-ratio combinations with 
daunorubicin or cytarabine (Ara-C). These combinations were repeatedly yielding combination indices 
<1 over the most accurately defined dose/effect range. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The nonclinical absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) studies have been 
conducted in the same species and generally in the same strains as used in the toxicology studies. The 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of midostaurin (PKC412 or CGP41251) has been investigated upon single dose 
intravenous (IV) or oral (PO) administration. Multiple dose TK was examined upon daily intravenous 
and oral administration, which is the intended clinical route. The ADME information was obtained using 
rats, Beagle dogs, rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys (TK, IV only).

Specific and sensitive bioanalytical assays have been developed and validated for the quantitative 
determination of midostaurin in rat, monkey and dog plasma. The methods for quantitation of 
midostaurin utilized a common liquid/liquid extraction with tert-butylmethylether, followed by reversed 
phase liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS/MS) or an HPLC with 
fluorescence detection. Metabolites were characterized and quantified by HPLC with radioactivity 
detection and their chemical structures were elucidated by LC-MS/MS and, when possible, co-elution 
with non-radiolabelled standards. 
Midostaurin PK parameters in plasma after a single oral dose in animal species and human and after a 
single IV dose in animals are displayed in Table 6 and Table 7 respectively.

Midostaurin showed a very high plasma protein binding in the rat, dog and human (>99%). The 
fraction unbound (Fu) was dependent on the measurement method, i.e. ~1.2% for rat, dog and 
human measured by ultrafiltration method and 0.10%, 0.08% and 0.01%-0.07% for rat, dog and 
human, respectively, as measured by equilibration gel filtration method. The binding was independent 
of concentration in animals. In human, a concentration dependent increase in Fu was observed, but 
the Fu of midostaurin did not appear to be concentration dependent at a clinically relevant steady state 
concentration range. At the clinically relevant midostaurin concentrations, Fu was 8-10-fold higher in 
rat and dog than in humans (0.01%). The two major metabolites of midostaurin, CGP52421  and 
CGP62221, showed a comparable, concentration dependent, protein binding similar as midostaurin in 
human plasma, but not in rat or dog plasma. At the (pre)clinically relevant concentrations, Fu of the 
metabolites (CGP52421 & CGP62221) was 0.02% & 0.04% in humans, 0.24% & 0.23% in rat and 
0.20% & 0.19% in dog, which means a 2-4 fold higher free fraction than of midostaurin. Blood to 
plasma (B/P) ratio of midostaurin was not reported. [14C]-related radioactivity B/P distribution was 0.8 
shortly after [14C]midostaurin dosing in the rat, suggesting low partitioning into red blood cells. 
The in vivo tissue distribution of [14C]midostaurin was investigated in the rat (male, albino and 
pigmented) at 0.083h up to 168h post dosing, and assessed quantitatively by measuring radioactivity 
in homogenized tissues. Upon both oral and intravenous administration, radioactivity was quickly 
distributed to all tissues studied and tissue to blood ratio (T/B) was found to be higher than 1 for most 
tissues at 5 min post dose. The highest 14C-related radioactivity was found in organs or tissues 
involved in the absorption, metabolism and excretion such as the organs of the gastrointestinal tract, 
liver (T/B 40x) and kidneys (T/B 12-15x), but also in the brown fat (T/B 10-30x) and in glandular 
tissues such as the pancreas (T/B 9-11x) and the adrenal glands (T/B 12-30x). Exposure in these 
latter two tissues appeared also to be related to toxicological findings, which can be found in the 
toxicology section. At 168h post single dose administration of [14C]midostaurin, radioactivity was low 
but still measurable in blood and several tissues, especially in liver and kidney. Radioactivity from 
[14C]midostaurin crossed the blood brain barrier and the highest [14C]concentrations were seen in the 
frontal cortex. No melanin binding was observed but melanin containing tissues, like skin, were not 
measured in the pigmented rats. After repeated oral dosing of [14C]midostaurin to rats (18 days), the 
radioactivity levels in investigated organs and tissues increased, in line with blood levels, and 
approached steady-state levels, which were 2- to 10-fold higher than those after a single dose. 
Based on the radioactivity tissue distribution in the pregnant rats studied by on gestation days 12 and 
17, the drug related radioactivity was distinct and moderately distributed to the foetus with a ‘whole 
foetus’-to-maternal blood ratio of 2 - 5 on GD 12 and 0.6 – 1.2 on GD 17. Radioactivity crossed the 
blood brain barrier and the foetal brain-to-maternal blood ratios ranged from 0.27 - 0.47 on GD 17. 
Upon oral dosing of 20 mg/kg [14C]midostaurin to pregnant rabbits (GD 17), the transfer of 
radioactivity was similarly distributed as in the rat. At 24h after dosing, the radioactivity was equal to 
maternal blood in foetal liver and 2-fold lower than that in the maternal blood in the whole foetus and 
foetal brain showing prolonged systemic exposure of the foetus to midostaurin. Following a single oral 
30 mg/kg dose of [14C]midostaurin to lactating dams, [14C]midostaurin-related radioactivity was 
excreted into the milk with peak concentrations at 4 hours post dose.  
Midostaurin was mainly eliminated by extensive oxidative metabolism in the rat, rabbit, dog and 
human. The primary biotransformation pathways observed in the ADME studies included mono-
hydroxylation, O-demethylation, N-demethylation (human only) and amide hydrolysis (human only). 
O-demethylation and/or N-demethylation coupled with an extra hydroxylation led to the formation of

Page 33/209 
  
  
 
 
several additional metabolites. Other secondary biotransformation pathways involving the primary 
biotransformation products included di-hydroxylation, glucuronidation and glycine conjugation. In 
plasma, unchanged midostaurin was one of most abundant drug-related components found in all four 
species (22% in humans, 25% in rat, 41% in rabbit and in dog 57% of the total drug-related AUC), 
following a single oral dose of [14C]midostaurin. Circulating metabolites that were common to all 
species were P37.7 (epimer 1 of CGP52421, mono-hydroxylation metabolite on the pyrrolidinone 
moiety) and P39.8 (epimer 2 of CGP52421), accounting respectively for 5% & 33% in human, 20% & 
37% in rat, 22% & 19% in rabbit and 22% & 4% in dog. The steady state plasma exposures of 
midostaurin and its two major metabolites, CGP52421 (epimer 1 plus epimer 2) and CGP62221 were 
higher in AML and ASM patients than those in rats, dogs, monkeys and rabbits. In AML patients, 
CGP52421 exposure increased to 3 – 8-fold the midostaurin exposure upon prolonged treatment. This 
is in line with the long apparent half-life of CGP52421 and CGP62221 in human (495 and 33 h, 
respectively). The total human/animal AUC ratios in the rat and dog, the general toxicology species, 
were higher for midostaurin (13 - 20 fold), CGP52421 (17 - 33 fold), and CGP62221 (71 fold), while 
the exposure of CGP62221 was not detectable in rat. Taking protein binding species differences into 
account, the free human/animal AUC ratios were 3.4 – 4.0 fold for midostaurin and 1.6 - 3.4 fold for 
CGP52421 in rat and dog and 13.8 fold for CGP62221 in dog. In excreta, following an IV or oral dose of 
[14C]midostaurin to the intact rat, rabbit, dog or human, midostaurin was extensively metabolized and 
excretion of radioactivity was primarily through the faecal route leaving 6.3%, 11.2% and 18.7% as 
unchanged midostaurin in rat, rabbit and dog respectively. In human, after oral administration, only 
3.4% of the dose was detected as unchanged midostaurin in the faeces, with the remainder (74%) 
excreted as oxidative metabolites. Of the metabolites found in human faeces all were <6% of the 
administered dose, except for P29.6B (26.7%), which has both the O-demethylation and the 
pyrrolidinone hydroxylation modification. 
The in vitro biotransformation of [14C]midostaurin by human liver slices, human hepatocytes or 
microsomes occurred mainly via oxidative pathways. This involved primary hydroxylation and O-
demethylation pathways. The metabolic profiles of rat, dog, monkey, human liver slices and human 
hepatocytes incubations showed qualitative and quantitative differences. The biotransformation 
reactions observed in vitro were the same as those observed in vivo but the N-demethylation 
metabolites, which were found in vivo in humans, were not observed.  The formation of hydroxylated 
and O-demethylated metabolites of midostaurin was predominantly catalysed by CYP3A4, with a very 
minor contribution of CYP1A1. No metabolism of midostaurin was noted in vitro with CYP1A2, CYP2A6, 
CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A5. 
In all species the excretion of [14C]midostaurin-associated radioactivity was predominantly through 
the faecal (biliary) pathway, and, for the intact rat, rabbit and dog, it accounted for ~67% to 98% of 
the radioactivity dose while the urinary route contributed 0.7 - 2.1%.  In bile duct-cannulated rats, 
excretion into the urine, faeces and bile was <1.6%, 9.8%, and 83.7% of the radioactivity dose, 
respectively, following intravenous administration indicating a predominant biliary clearance. Similarly, 
in humans, 77.6% of the administered radioactivity was found in the faeces while ~4.0% was excreted 
in the urine. After 7 and 20 days 71.2% and 77.6% of the administered single dose was recovered in 
human. This slow recovery may be related to the long half-life of the metabolites, such as CGP52421, 
which has a terminal half-life of 495h.

At the maximum tolerated doses tested in animals, the systemic exposure (AUC) of midostaurin was 7- 
and 20- times lower (exposure multiple 0.15 and 0.05) than that in patients administered midostaurin 
at 50 mg bid or 100 mg bid respectively. Exposure of the two major human metabolites CGP52421 and 
CGP62221 was similarly much lower in animals than in patients. Protein binding was high across 
species (>99 %,) but higher in humans than in rats and dogs. When corrected for protein binding, the 
free drug concentrations of midostaurin and the metabolites in animals while slightly higher were still 
below those in patients (4 – 1.4 times lower for midostaurin). There are therefore no margins of safety 
for midostaurin when comparing animal exposures at the MTDs and human exposure at the clinical 
doses. 
Local Tolerance  
A number of iv tolerability studies were conducted in rabbits (studies 956134, 946042, 0970338). No 
local irritation was observed after 5 consecutive doses of 0.1% midostaurin. When administered as a 
single, 2-hour infusion at 0.179 mg/kg (suspended in PEG300, Polysorbate 80, ethanol and 5% 
glucose), phlebitis/ periphlebitis, thrombosis, haemorrhages, inflammatory cell infiltration in 
interstitium and oedema were recorded in both groups (midostaurin-treated and control) after dosing 
and were considered related to the application procedures in combination with the vehicle. The 
incidence of the thrombosis and haemorrhage was slightly higher in midostaurin-treated animals. On 
day 5 after administration, phlebitis/periphlebitis and inflammatory cell infiltration in interstitium

remained in both vehicle and midostaurin-treated groups whereas thrombosis and haemorrhage only 
remained in one animal each treated with midostaurin. There was a tendency for increased incidence 
and/or severity of these lesions in midostaurin-treated animals. 
Other toxicity studies 
The antigenicity of the midostaurin formulation was investigated in guinea pigs using active systemic 
anaphylaxis (ASA) and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) tests (study 93041). No signs of 
antigenicity due to antigen-antibody reaction were observed with midostaurin (ASA test), nor were 
antibodies specific to midostaurin detected in the PCA test. The results indicated that PKC412 did not 
cause either active systemic or passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reaction. 
The phototoxic potential after po and iv administration midostaurin was evaluated in albino, hairless 
mice (2/sex/group) (study 936267). Mild skin reactions (very slight erythema and oedema) were seen 
only in the 300 mg/kg treated group after oral administration and UV-A irradiation or combined UV-A 
and UV-B irradiation. No skin reactions were seen after iv administration of PKC412 at doses up to and 
including 30 mg/kg, and UV-A irradiation of mice. 
Repeated administration of 0.5% and 1% midostaurin ointment by instillation into the conjunctival sac 
of both eyes did not lead to ocular irritation in rabbits (study 15888-02), but led to ocular irritation and 
morphological changes in dogs (study 16025/02). The changes tended to be more pronounced with 
increasing concentrations of midostaurin. Single subconjunctival and retrobulbar injection of 
microspheres with up to 50% midostaurin in rabbits led to treatment-related irritation and 
morphological changes (study 15889/1/02). The changes tended to be more pronounced with 
increasing concentrations of midostaurin.  
In vivo results of ocular irritation studies in beagle dogs (Study 15889/1/02) indicated that a 
midostaurin ointment was irritating in concentrations as low as 50 μg/eye. Similar concentrations were 
not irritating to rabbit eyes (Study 15888-02). The bovine corneal opacity (BCOP) assay used to in 
order to determine the risk of ocular irritation from low residue levels of midostaurin on the blistered 
capsules. The BCOP assay categorized midostaurin as a non-irritant at concentrations of 20 µg/ml to 2 
mg/ml. Based on these results, the low levels of midostaurin residues (<80 μg/capsule) on capsules 
would not be expected to pose a risk of ocular irritation to handlers of midostaurin during clinical use 
(study 1570160). 
Midostaurin appeared as a weak lymph node activator and weak skin irritant in the murine LLNA (tier 
I-study 0317010), leading to lymph node hyperplasia and skin irritation exceeding the applied 
thresholds. The finding was without statistical significance, and is therefore considered as an equivocal 
result.  In LLNA tier II (study 0317017) no allergy-relevant changes were found on ear weight and 
draining lymph node hyperplasia and no changes in body weight were noted in the study. In 
conclusion, midostaurin was not a skin sensitizer in the murine LLNA (tier II). 
Computational analysis showed the metabolites CGP52421 and CGP62221 are structurally similar to, 
midostaurin. Both metabolites were not mutagenic in an Ames test, with or without metabolic 
activation (studies 001647 and 001648). 
The identified impurities 545-06 (desmethyl-PKC412, CGP62221), 513-03 (7-oxo-PKC412, CGP47772), 
511-03 (staurosporine, CGP39360) and palmitoyl staurosporine are specified at a limit ≤ 0.10% in the 
drug substance.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Although midostaurin has a high binding affinity with a strong enzyme inhibition for FLT3 and KIT 
mutated receptors, it is not a very selective kinase inhibitor. This may explain unexplained effects in 
the repeated dose toxicology and human safety studies. 
The CGP52421 and CGP62221 metabolites are present in human plasma at similar or higher 
concentrations compared to midostaurin and may contribute to safety issues. In addition, P33 (the O-
demethylated and hydroxylated metabolite of midostaurin) is the most abundant (7.1%) of the four 
minor human metabolites which were not observed in animals. Kinase inhibition data showed that 
metabolite CGP62221 is comparable to or up to a factor 2 higher than the parent compound 
midostaurin. Midostaurin and CGP62221 can therefore be considered multi-kinase inhibitors with a 
similar potency for a range of kinases and metabolite CGP62221 is expected to contribute to the 
pharmacological and toxicological endpoints of this product. Kinase inhibition of CGP52421 is in general 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/516229/2017 
Page 46/209 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
less potent than midostaurin. Therefore, metabolite CGP52421 is expected to contribute less to 
pharmacology and toxicology of the product.  
Due to dose limiting toxicity, clinical therapeutic exposure levels could not be reached in animals. All 
animal findings described below were observed at midostaurin exposure significantly lower than 
therapeutic levels (SmPC, section 5.3). 
In vitro, midostaurin did not inhibit hERG channel activity up to the limit of solubility of 12 µM. The two 
major human metabolites GGP52421 and CGP62221 (also tested at the limit of solubility) inhibited 
hERG current with moderate safety margins (SmPC, section 5.3). Due to technical limitations in the 
hERG channel tests, higher concentrations could not be tested, but it can be assumed that stronger 
inhibition would occur at higher concentrations. 
Safety pharmacology studies indicated that midostaurin is unlikely to interfere with vital functions of 
the central nervous system (SmPC, section 5.3). 
The midostaurin hERG test and the in vivo rat cardiovascular safety pharmacology study are not 
considered to be conducted under GLP. Furthermore, individual data for the in vivo study is lacking, 
and this level of detail would have been preferred. However, due to the information on cardiovascular 
toxicity gained from repeated dose toxicity studies in dogs (prolongation of PQ interval with sporadic 
AV block) a possible risk for human cannot be ruled out. To further investigate cardiovascular effects of 
midostaurin, a clinical thorough QT study was performed (see clinical safety section). Despite the 
shortcomings in the non-clinical package, no further non-clinical studies are considered necessary.  
No respiratory safety pharmacology studies were provided by the applicant. However pulmonary 
toxicity was observed in the juvenile rat toxicity studies following repeated doses of midostaurin at 15 
mg/kg and was characterized by minimal to slight haemorrhage and minimal to moderate mixed cell 
infiltration in the lungs. The lung changes observed by histopathology correlated with pulmonary dark 
area(s) noted macroscopically. There were no treatment-related clinical signs. Pulmonary events in the 
clinic included pneumonitis and interstitial lung disease and were reported infrequently in both 
advanced SM and AML patients. The proportion of patients with pulmonary toxicity was low among 
patients with advanced SM and similar to placebo in AML patients in the clinical trials (see clinical 
safety section and RMP).  
In the repeat dose studies in dogs, a decrease in heart rate, prolongation of the P-Q interval, and 
sporadically occurring atrioventricular blocks were seen in individual animals. 
In the repeat dose studies, target organs for toxicity were the gastrointestinal tract (emesis in dogs 
and monkeys, diarrhoea and mucosal alteration), testes (decreased spermatogenesis), bone marrow 
(hypocellularity) and lymphoid organs (depletion/atrophy). The effect on the bone marrow and 
lymphoid organs was accompanied by haematological changes of decreased white blood cells, 
lymphocytes and erythrocytic parameters. An increase in liver enzymes (ALT and AST) was seen 
consistently in rats and in dogs and monkeys in long term studies of ≥ 3 months duration, without 
histopathological correlates (SmPC, section 5.3). 
All these toxicological findings in rats and dogs are in line with observations from animal studies with 
other multi-kinase inhibitors like sunitinib, sorafenib, ponatinib and regorafenib. For midostaurin, 
leukopenia, pulmonary toxicity and cardiac dysfunction have been included in the RMP.  Regarding 
pancreatitis, the data collected thus far in patients treated with midostaurin does not support a causal 
relation of midostaurin and pancreas toxicity (see clinical safety section). Effects including 
hyperglycemia, and adverse effects on the blood, lymphatic system, blood coagulation, gastrointestinal 
tract and the respiratory are adequately reflected in section 4.8 the SmPC. Additional measures are not 
needed from the nonclinical point of view.

In a fertility study in rats, midostaurin was associated with reduced fertility, testicular degeneration 
and atrophy, reduced sperm motility, oligo-  and aspermia, increased resorptions, decreased 
pregnancy rate, number of implants and live embryos (SmPC, section 5.3). 
In embryo-foetal development studies in rats and rabbits, increased numbers of late resorptions, 
reduced foetal weight and reduced skeletal ossification were observed (SmPC, section 5.3). 
In a pre-  and post- natal developmental study, maternal dystocia and reduced litter size, lower pup 
body weights, accelerated complete eye opening and delayed auricular startle ontogeny were noted . 
In a toxicity study in juvenile rats, midostaurin was administered from days 7 to 70 postpartum. A 
reduction in body weight, haemorrhage and mixed cell infiltration in the lungs, and 
erythrocytosis/erythrophagocytosis in the mesenteric lymph nodes were seen. There were no effects 
on physical development, sensory function or behavioural function. Mating index, fertility index and 
conception rates were reduced at 0, 5 and 15 mg/kg/day, but not at 2 mg/kg/day (SmPC, section 5.3). 
In vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies covering relevant genotoxicity endpoints showed no evidence 
of mutagenic or clastogenic activity (SmPC, section 5.3).  
No carcinogenicity studies have been performed (SmPC, section 5.3). This approach is in line with the 
ICH S1A that no long-term carcinogenicity studies are required if the life-expectancy in the indicated 
patient populations is short. Patients with the ASM/SM-AHN/MCL indication have an overall median 
survival of 26 months. Patients with the AML indication have an overall median survival about 5 years 
but these patients receive also chemotherapy and may therefore have an increased risk for cancer. 
Women of childbearing potential should be informed that animal studies show midostaurin to be 
harmful to the developing foetus. Sexually active women of child bearing potential are advised to have 
a pregnancy test prior to starting treatment with Rydapt and that they should use effective 
contraception (methods that result in less than 1% pregnancy rates) when using Rydapt and for at 
least 4 months after stopping treatment with Rydapt. It is currently unknown whether midostaurin may 
reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, and therefore women using hormonal 
contraceptives should add a barrier method of contraception (SmPC, section 4.6). The impact of 
midostaurin on oral contraceptives after 28 days of treatment will be investigated by the applicant (see 
Risk Management Plan). 
Midostaurin can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate 
and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Reproductive studies in rats and rabbits demonstrated 
that midostaurin induced foetotoxicity. Rydapt is not recommended during pregnancy or in women of 
childbearing potential not using contraception. Pregnant women should be advised of the potential risk 
to the foetus (SmPC, section 4.6). Reproductive toxicity and developmental toxicity have been 
categorized as potential risks (see Risk Management Plan). 
It is unknown whether midostaurin or its active metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available 
animal data have shown that midostaurin and its active metabolites pass into the milk of lactating rats. 
Breast feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Rydapt and for at least 4 months after 
stopping treatment (SmPC, section 4.6). The use of midostaurin during lactation has been categorized 
as potential risk (see Risk Management Plan). 
There are no data on the effect of Rydapt on human fertility. Animal studies with midostaurin have 
shown impaired fertility (SmPC, section 4.6). 
No melanin binding was observed but melanin containing tissues, like skin, were not measured in the 
pigmented rats. In phototoxicology study, however, no toxicological findings were reported, suggesting 
that if melanin binding occurred, this apparently has no toxicological consequences.

Environmental risk assessment studies have shown that midostaurin has the potential to be persistent, 
bioaccumulative and toxic to the environment (SmPC section 5.3). A risk to the groundwater, surface 
water, soil and sediment compartment and the STP following the use of midostaurin as prescribed, is 
not anticipated.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
An overview of all clinical pharmacology studies and studies with a PK component is provided in Table 16.  
In addition, population pharmacokinetic analyses were performed separately for ASM/SM-AHN/MCL and AML 
and separately for midostaurin and its two active metabolites, with the aim to characterize the 
concentration-time relationships. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic modelling (PBPK) was performed 
to predict the outcome of drug-drug interaction with midostaurin and metabolites’ clinical exposure following 
single and multiple dosing scenarios.

Absorption 
The absolute bioavailability of midostaurin from oral formulation could not be estimated because the study 
A2120 was terminated due to severe adverse event occurred in the first subject with the treatment of 
midostaurin intravenous infusion (grade 4 anaphylactic reaction).  
In the mass-balance study A2107 (with oral solution, single dose of 50 mg under fasting conditions) oral 
absorption of midostaurin was rapid with peak plasma concentrations being observed at 1-3 h post dose. The 
oral absorption was estimated to be high following administration of a single dose of 50 mg midostaurin since 
only 3.4% of the parent was found in the faeces and the compound was stable in the gut. Since the total 
radioactivity recovered in the urine was only 4.0% of the dose, it was not possible to estimate the absorption 
based on the urinary data.  
Study A2111 was conducted to investigate the effect of food on pharmacokinetics of midostaurin and the 
active metabolites for FMI formulation, and to also compare the absorption of midostaurin in FMI and oral 
solution under fed conditions. The study was designed as a single dose (50 mg) open-label, randomised, four 
parallel groups study in healthy subjects under three conditions i.e. fasting (for FMI), fed with a standard 
meal (for FMI and oral solution) and with a high fat meal (for FMI). A standard meal was defined as a 450 
calorie breakfast consisting of 25% fat, whereas high fat meal was about 9000-1000 calorie breakfast. In 
total 50 subjects were enrolled in the study: 12 each in FMI [fed-standard] and oral solution [fed-standard] 
treatment groups and 13 each in FMI [fed-high] and [fasted] treatment groups respectively. The rate of 
absorption of midostaurin and its metabolites was decreased (Cmax ratio: 0.73, (90% CI: 0.59 - 0.90)) while 
the extent of absorption was increased (AUCinf ratio: 1.59 (90% CI: 1.22 - 2.08)) when administered with 
high-fat meal as compared to fasted conditions (Table 17). The absorption was delayed by 1.5 hours. The 
effect of a standard meal on the PK of 50 mg midostaurin was of a lower magnitude from that of a high-fat 
meal. After a standard meal, the Cmax of midostaurin decreased by 20% and the AUCinf increased by 22%, 
while the median Tmax was delayed by 1 hour as compared to fasting conditions. 
Table 15. Food effect: summary of statistical analysis of primary PK parameters for capsule – 
Study A2111 
In clinical studies, the efficacy and safety of Rydapt were investigated following administration with a light 
meal. After oral administration of a single 100 mg dose of midostaurin under fed conditions in ASM, SM AHN 
and MCL patients, AUCinf, Cmax and Tmax were 49600 ng*h/ml, 2940 ng/ml and 3 h, respectively, for 
midostaurin. For CGP52421, AUC0-12h and Cmax were 2770 ng*h/ml and 299 ng/ml, respectively. AUC0-12h 
and Cmax for CGP62221 were 8700 ng*h/ml and 931 ng/ml, respectively. After 100 mg bid multiple oral doses

of midostaurin the Cmin,ss plasma midostaurin in AML and ASM, SM-HN, MCL patients were 919 and 1060 
ng/ml, respectively. The CGP62421 Cmin, ss in the AML and the ASM, SM-AHN, MCL population were 1610 
ng/ml and 2020 ng/ml, respectively. The CGP52421, Cmin,ss in the AML and the ASM, SM-AHN, MCL population 
were 8630 ng/ml and 2860  ng/ml, respectively (SmPC section 5.2). 
Distribution 
Midostaurin has a tissue distribution of geometric mean of 95.2 l (Vz/F). Midostaurin and its metabolites are 
distributed mainly in plasma rather than red blood cells. In vitro data showed midostaurin is more than 98% 
bound to plasma proteins, such as albumin, α1 acid glycoprotein (AGP) and lipoprotein (SmPC, section 5.2). 
Elimination 
Midostaurin is metabolised by CYP3A4 mainly via oxidative pathways. The major plasma components 
included midostaurin and two major active metabolites, CGP62221 (via O demethylation) and CGP52421 (via 
hydroxylation), accounting for 27.7±2.7% and 38.0±6.6%, respectively, of the total plasma exposure at 96 
hours after a single 50 mg dose of midostaurin (SmPC, section 5.2). 
The median terminal half-lives of midostaurin, CGP62221 and CGP52421 in plasma are approximately 20.5, 
32.3 and 482 hours. The mean apparent plasma clearance (CL/F) was 2.4-3.1 l/h in healthy subjects. In AML 
and ASM, SM-AHN and MCL patients, population pharmacokinetic estimates for clearance of midostaurin at 
steady state were 5.9 l/h and 4.4 l/h, respectively. The Human Mass Balance study results indicated that 
faecal excretion is the major route of excretion (78% of the dose), and mostly as metabolites (73% of the 
dose), while unchanged midostaurin accounts for 3% of the dose. Only 4% of the dose is recovered in urine 
(SmPC, section 5.2).

Time dependencies 
In Study A2213, 23 ASM/MCL patients were included, and each patient received 100 mg b.i.d. midostaurin 
for up to 12 cycles (one cycle = 28 days). For the multiple dose PK, the geometric mean plasma 
concentrations of midostaurin accumulated notably during at least the first 3 days of the dosing cycle, 
reaching a peak concentration (peak Ctrough) of 2649.03 ng/mL (CV%=72.59%). On Cycle 1 Day 8, the 
geometric-mean pre-dose concentrations decreased to 1828.21 ng/mL, (CV%=97.5%). The levels continued 
to decline up to 760.46 ng/mL (CV% = 21.61%) towards the end of the cycle (Day 28 pre-dose).  The 
concentrations of the metabolite CGP62221 showed the same type of PK pattern as the parent over the first 
cycle with an initial concentration accumulation. The geometric mean peak Ctrough 3256.75 ng/mL (CV% 
=51.44%) was observed at Day 8 followed by a decrease up to 1812.02 ng/mL (CV%=17.67%) at Day 28 
pre-dose.  In contrast, the geometric plasma concentrations of CGP52421 increased steadily over the dosing 
cycle till the last day of sampling. The geometric mean peak plasma concentrations were reached on Day 28 
pre-dose (3379.41 ng/mL ± 13.64).  
In study D2201, midostaurin, CGP62221 and CGP52421 showed time-dependent kinetics. Following daily 
dosing (100 mg b.i.d.), midostaurin and CGP62221 metabolite plasma concentrations accumulated notably in 
the first 3-6 days in ASM/MCL patients. Thereafter their levels declined substantially, until reaching a plateau 
after 22 days of treatment. The geometric mean plasma concentrations of midostaurin accumulated notably 
during the first 3 days of the dosing cycle, reaching a pre-dose peak concentration (peak Ctrough) of 2762.16 
ng/mL (CV% =59.52%) which thereafter declined towards a steady state (Ctrough SS) value of 1122.77 ng/mL 
(CV% =66.66%) at Day 28. 
The concentration-time profile of the metabolite CGP62221 showed the same pattern as the parent 
compound with an initial accumulation reaching a geometric mean peak concentration (peak Ctrough) of 
3194.15 ng/mL (CV% =45.11%) at Day 8 followed by a decrease to 2113.47 ng/mL (CV%=43.87%) at Day 
28.  
The geometric mean plasma concentrations of CGP52421 increased steadily over the dosing cycle until 
reaching a plateau on Day 28, with a geometric Cmin of 2518.50 ng/mL (CV%=39.06) (study A2213). 
In study A2104E1 in AML patients, the doses of 100 mg b.i.d. and 50 mg b.i.d. were used in two groups of 
the patients respectively. The PK profile of midostaurin and both active metabolites were shown in the figures 
below (100 mg b.i.d. up to 6 cycles and 50 mg b.i.d. up to 4 cycles). 
Determination of steady state and accumulation ratio 
Based on the statistical analysis presented in Table 20 and Table 21 (ASM/MCL  Studies: D2201 (100mg 
b.i.d.), A2213 (100mg b.i.d.); and AML study A2104 E1 (50mg b.i.d. and 100mg b.i.d.)), steady state is 
reached after one month of treatment (by C2D1 = Day 29) for midostaurin and CGP62221. The CGP52421 
steady-state was reached after one month of treatment in the ASM/MCL  population, whereas for AML 
patients, the concentrations were observed to continue to increase until C3D1. However, CGP52421 
concentrations are not available beyond this time point from pooled data.  
Analyses were performed for the individual concentrations of moieties, for patients from single agent studies 
who received no CYP3A4 medication.

Special populations 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses no significant impact of age on the pharmacokinetics of 
midostaurin and its two active metabolites was identified for patients aged between 65 and 85 years. In adult 
patients with ASM, SM-AHN and MCL or AML, no midostaurin dose adjustment is required based on age 
(SmPC section 5.2).

The pharmacokinetics of midostaurin in paediatric patients were explored in a phase I dose escalation 
monotherapy study with 22 patients (12 aged 0-2 years and 10 aged 10-17 years) with AML or 
MLL-rearranged ALL using a population pharmacokinetic approach. The pharmacokinetics of midostaurin were 
less than dose proportional with the doses of 30 mg/m2 and 60 mg/m2 after single and multiple doses. Due 
to the limited pharmacokinetic data in paediatric patients, no comparison with midostaurin pharmacokinetics 
in adults can be made (SmPC section 5.2). 
Based on population pharmacokinetic model analyses of the effect of gender on clearance of midostaurin and 
its active metabolites, there was no statistically significant finding and the anticipated changes in exposure 
(<20%) were not deemed to be clinically relevant. No midostaurin dose adjustment is required based on 
gender (SmPC section 5.2). 
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetic profile between Caucasian and Black subjects. Based on a 
phase I study in healthy Japanese volunteers, pharmacokinetic profiles of midostaurin and its metabolites 
(CGP62221 and CGP52421) are similar compared to those observed in other pharmacokinetic studies 
conducted in Caucasians and Blacks. No midostaurin dose adjustment is required based on ethnicity (SmPC 
section 5.2). 
A dedicated hepatic impairment study assessed the systemic exposure of midostaurin after oral 
administration of 50 mg twice daily for 6 days in subjects with baseline mild or moderate hepatic impairment 
(Child Pugh Class A or B, respectively) and control subjects with normal hepatic function. The maximum 
concentration was reached between 2 and 3 hours after administration after single or repeated doses for all 
groups. On day 1, the AUC0 12 and Cmax were 8130 ng*h/ml and 1206 ng/ml, respectively, for healthy 
subjects. AUC0 12 was decreased by 39% and 36% in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, 
respectively. On day 7, AUCCtrough (exposure under the curve of Ctrough from day 1 to day 7) was 5410 
ng*h/ml in healthy subjects and was decreased by 35% and 20% in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic 
impairment, respectively. AUCtau was decreased by 28% and 20% on day 7, respectively. Finally, the long 
term data from patients were analysed using a population pharmacokinetic approach. No impact of hepatic 
impairment could be identified in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment in the ASM, SM AHN, 
MCL and AML populations (SmPC section 5.2). 
Overall, there was no clinically relevant increase in exposure (AUC) to plasma midostaurin in subjects with 
mild or moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. No dosage 
adjustment is necessary for patients with baseline mild or moderate hepatic impairment. The 
pharmacokinetics of midostaurin have not been assessed in patients with baseline severe hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh Class C) (SmPC section 5.2).  
Renal elimination is a minor route of elimination for midostaurin. No dedicated renal impairment study was 
conducted for midostaurin. Population pharmacokinetic analyses were conducted using data from clinical 
studies in patients with AML (n=180) and ASM, SM-AHN and MCL (n=141). Out of the 321 patients included, 
177 patients showed pre-existing mild (n=113), moderate (n=60) or severe (n=4) renal impairment 
(15 ml/min ≤ creatinine clearance [CrCL] <90 ml/min). 144 patients showed normal renal function (CrCL 
>90 ml/min) at baseline. Based on the population pharmacokinetic analyses, midostaurin clearance was not 
significantly impacted by renal impairment and therefore no dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with 
mild or moderate renal impairment (SmPC section 5.2).

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro 
The potential of midostaurin, CGP62221 and CGP52421 to inhibit human CYP enzyme activity was assessed 
(reports R0300937, R0300937b, R0300937c, R0900508 and R1500784). Time-dependent inhibition of 
CYP3A4/5 by midostaurin, CGP52421, and CGP62221 was observed (Table 23). 
Table 21. Summary of CYP inhibition by midostaurin, CGP52421 and CGP62221 
Pregnane X receptor transcriptional activation by midostaurin, CGP62221 and CGP52421, in comparison to 
the positive control, rifampicin, was assessed in a CYP3A4 reporter gene assay (report R0400365). 
Midostaurin, CGP62221 and CGP52421 were found to activate reporter gene suggesting that all compounds 
can act as in vivo inducers of CYP3A. The induction potential of midostaurin, CGP52421 and CGP62221 to 
induce the mRNA and activity levels of CYP enzymes, UGT1A1, and the mRNA levels of P-gp and MRP2 in 
vitro was evaluated in human hepatocytes prepared from three separate donor livers. Midostaurin, CGP52421 
and CGP62221 induced mRNA levels of several CYP enzymes and transporters (CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2J2, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, UGT1A1 and MRP2) that may result in decreased 
exposure to co-administered compounds (report R0700598). 
Midostaurin uptake into human hepatocytes was shown to be mainly via passive diffusion and not facilitated 
by the major hepatic uptake transporters (report R1200335). 
The potential for midostaurin to inhibit P-glycoprotein (P-gp, MDR1, ABCB1), the human breast cancer 
resistance protein (BCRP, ABCG2) and multidrug resistance associated protein 2 (MRP2) was examined 
(reports R0300018 and R0900746). Partial inhibition of P-gp and BCRP activities was observed by 
midostaurin suggesting a potential for midostaurin to affect the pharmacokinetics of P-gp and BCRP 
substrates in vivo. Midostaurin was shown not to inhibit MRP2 activity. 
The potential interaction of midostaurin with efflux proteins was also examined following transport studies 
across confluent Caco-2 (report R0900809) and LLC-PK1/MDR1 (report R1300627) cell monolayers. No 
evidence for P-gp- or MRP2-mediated transport was apparent in these studies.

The potential of midostaurin, CGP62221 and CGP52421 to inhibit the transport activities of the organic anion 
transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) or organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B3 (OATP1B3) were 
examined (reports R1200326 and R1500741). Midostaurin, CGP62221 and CGP52421 more potently inhibited 
OATP1B1 transport activity compared to OATP1B3 suggesting a potential effect on the pharmacokinetics of 
co-medications whose clearance is significantly mediated by OATP1B1. 
The potential inhibitory effect of midostaurin, CGP52421, and CGP62221 on the activity of human renal 
organic anion transporters 1 (OAT1) and 3 (OAT3) was examined (reports R1200327 and R1500678). 
Midostaurin, CGP62221 and CGP52421 had little effect on the activity of either transporter suggesting that 
clinical concentrations due to OAT1 and OAT3 inhibition are unlikely. 
The potential inhibitory effect of midostaurin, CGP52421 and CGP62221 on the activity of organic cation 
transporter (OCT) 1 and OCT2, multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter (MATE) 1, or MATE2-K was 
examined (reports R1200410, R1200637 and R1500735). Midostaurin, CGP52421 or CGP62221 had little 
effect on the transport activity of OCT1, OCT2 and weakly inhibited transport mediated by MATE1 or MATE2-
K. 
In vivo 
Study CPKC412A2109 was an open-label, randomized, parallel group study to evaluate the impact of the 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole, administered to steady-state, once daily at 400 mg for 10 days, on the 
pharmacokinetics of a single oral 50 mg dose of midostaurin in healthy subjects. Summary of statistical 
analysis of primary PK parameters are shown in Table 24. 
Table 22. Summary of statistical analysis of primary PK parameters: DDI with ketoconazole - 
study CPKC412A2109 
In study CPKC412A2104E1 a total of 29 patients with AML/MDS were enrolled to explore the safety, 
tolerability, PK, and preliminary clinical efficacy of the two regimens consisting of an itraconazole combination 
arm, and the intra-patient dose escalation arm described below. In order to increase the plasma exposure of 
midostaurin, two strategies were explored. One study arm investigated the impact of intradose escalation, 
while another arm, investigated the impact of co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole 
on the exposure of midostaurin. The ratio of PK parameters for midostaurin and the metabolites CGP62221 
and CGP52421 on day 21 and day 28 of administration are summarized in Table 25.

In a pooled 
analysis across 
ASM and AML 
patients receiving 
midostaurin as 
single-agent 
therapy, a 2.7-fold 
increase of 
midostaurin exposure (Cmin) at steady-state upon co-administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors was 
observed. When exposure to the sum of active moieties was investigated, the geometric mean Cmin 
increased by 76% upon co-administration with CYP3A4 inhibitors. 
Study CPKC412A2110 was an open-label, randomized, parallel group study to evaluate the impact of the 
strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin administered to steady-state, once daily at 600 mg for 14 days, on the 
pharmacokinetics of midostaurin administered as a single oral 50 mg dose in healthy subjects. Summary of 
statistical analysis of primary PK parameters are presented in Table 26. 
Table 24. Summary of statistical analysis of primary PK parameters: DDI with rifampicin – study 
CPKC412A2110  
When midostaurin was co-administered with rifampicin, the geometric mean Cmax and AUClast values 
decreased by 73% and 94% reduction, respectively, compared to the placebo arm. The geometric mean 
apparent elimination half-life of midostaurin decreased from 23 hours to 5.1 hours in the presence of 
rifampicin. The geometric mean of apparent clearance (CL/F) increased by approximately 16.9-fold, from 2.2 
mL/min to 37.1 mL/min. Similarly, exposure to both active metabolites decreased. The Cmax of CGP62221 
and CGP52421 decreased by 37% and 35%, respectively. The AUClast of CGP52421 and CGP62221 
decreased by 92% and 59%, respectively. The apparent elimination half-life also decreased. The extent of 
decrease for the sum of active moieties was similar to that reported for individual moieties. 
In this study (CPKC412A2110) CYP3A4 induction was assessed by endogenous biomarkers 6β-hydroxycortisol 
to cortisol ratio and/or 4β-hydroxycholesterol. The circulating plasma level of the metabolite 4β-
hydroxycholesterol increases when CYP3A4 is induced by a strong inducer and in urine, the ratio of cortisol 
and its metabolite 6β-hydroxycortisol has been established as a method of evaluating CYP3A4 induction. Pre-
treatment of subjects for 9 days with clinically relevant doses of rifampicin was associated with a notable 
Assessment report

increase in the plasma concentration of 4β-hydroxycholesterol and in the ratio of 6β-hydroxycortisol/cortisol 
excreted in urine. These increases are evidence of CYP3A4 enzyme induction. 
The effect of CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers on midostaurin and metabolites has been evaluated using the 
Simcyp model (report R1500784-01), using in vitro data and PK data from six clinical trials: CPKC412A2108, 
control arms from CPKC412A2109 and CPKC412A2110, CPKC412A2111, CPKC412A2113 and CPKC412A2116. 
The simulation results suggested that DDI effects at steady-state levels would be lesser in magnitude 
compared to those following the administration of a single midostaurin dose.  
In the Phase 3 AML pivotal trial CPKC412A2301, most patients received concomitant antifungal therapy, 
including strong, moderate and mild CYP3A4 inhibitors. An analysis was performed to determine the impact 
co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors on drug exposure and total circulating activity, compared to all 
other patients, i.e. those who received other concomitant medications, including mild and moderate CYP3A4 
inhibitors. In patients who received concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, midostaurin concentrations were 
1.44-fold higher compared to all remaining patients in the study, and the overall change in exposure to the 
sum of active moieties was estimated to be 1.22-fold (Table 27). 
Table 25 Summary of statistical analysis of plasma Cmin versus CYP3A4 medication for 
midostaurin and the active metabolites and total exposure in study CPKC412A2301 (50 mg bid in 
combination)  
A significant effect of concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors on midostaurin clearance was identified in 
the AML population PK analysis (Population pharmacokinetics of midostaurin and its metabolites in Acute 
Myeloid Leukemia Modeling Report). The analysis showed that patients with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors had 
approximately the double of the exposures compared to those who were not on concurrent inhibitors.

Study CPKC412A2112 was an open label, single-arm study to evaluate midostaurin as a perpetrator of 
CYP3A4-mediated drug interactions. Single doses (4 mg each) of the sensitive substrate of CYP3A4, 
midazolam, were administered on day 1 (reference day), day 3 (assessment of acute inhibition), and day 8 
(assessment of induction) with washout at day 2 and a resting day at day 7.  
When co-administered with midostaurin, the geometric mean Cmax for midazolam and 1’-hydroxymidazolam 
decreased by 9% and 25%, respectively, on day 8 when compared to day 1. The average decrease in AUCinf 
was 5% for midazolam and 24% for 1’-hydroxymidazolam. The PK of midazolam or its metabolite 1’-
hydroxymidazolam was not affected in a clinically meaningful manner following four dosing days of 
midostaurin in healthy subjects. The dose of midazolam was administered only after four dosing days of 
midostaurin and not at steady-state. Therefore the possibility of midostaurin being a CYP3A4 inducer cannot 
be excluded from this study. 
In the the Simcyp model (report R1500887-01) also the effect of midostaurin, CGP52421 and CGP62221 on 
the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (sensitive CYP3A4 substrate) was predicted. It predicted an overall weak 
induction effect at steady-state. 
Study CPKC412A2106 was a Phase 1b combination study of midostaurin administered sequentially and 
concomitantly with daunorubicin and cytarabine in AML patients. The effect of midostaurin on the PK of 
daunorubicin and cytarabine was assessed by comparing plasma levels of daunorubicin and cytarabine in 
sequential versus concomitant dosing schedules. Summary of daunorubicin PK parameter comparison, alone 
versus combined with midostaurin, is presented in Table 28. 
Table 26. Summary of daunorubicin PK parameter comparison (alone versus combined with 
midostaurin) from study CPKC412A2106  
Exposure to daunorubicin (AUC and Cmax) seemed to decrease approximately 2-fold in the presence of 
midostaurin 100 mg bid, while no variation of daunorubicin concentrations was seen in the presence of 
midostaurin 50 mg bid.  
In some studies, CYP3A4 induction by midostaurin was assessed by endogenous biomarkers 6β-
hydroxycortisol to cortisol ratio. In study CPKC412A2112 pre-treatment of subjects with midostaurin at 
clinically relevant doses (100 mg once daily followed by 50 mg twice daily for 3 days) for 4 days was not 
accompanied by any notable changes in the plasma concentration of 4β-hydroxycholesterol or in the ratio of 
6β-hydroxycortisol/cortisol excreted in urine. In study CPKC412A2116, in the normal hepatic function group, 
the median 6β-hydroxycortisol/cortisol ratio was 4.41 at baseline and 6.02 on day 7. This increase following 
multiple dosing could be related to CYP3A4 induction by midostaurin. In study CPKC412D2201 analysis of the 
urinary 6β-hydroxycortisol to cortisol ratios on days 1, 3, 8, 15, 22 and 28 of cycle 1, and day 15 of cycle 2 
did not show any induction of CYP3A4 by midostaurin and its metabolites with no significant changes in the 
geo-mean ratio across time points.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
No clinical pharmacodynamic studies were submitted.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
In a phase II study of midostaurin monotherapy in AML or high-risk MDS with FLT3 mutated disease 
(PKC412A2104), FLT3 inhibition was measured in patients’ bone marrow and peripheral blood cells. No 
formal analysis could be conducted in this study as PD data were available for only 7 patients. Evidence of 
FLT3 inhibition (defined as greater than 30% decrease in activity from baseline) within 4 hours of midostaurin 
treatment was observed in 3 patients. Specifically, the percent decreases were 45%, 5%, 68%, 18%, 19%, 
39%, and 4%. These findings could not be related to treatment response, as no responses (complete or 
partial) were observed in this trial. 
No clinical pharmacodynamic data are provided in relation to the ASM indication.  
A dedicated QT/QTc study (PKC412A2113) a phase I, randomised, double-blinded, placebo and active 
controlled three-way parallel study to investigate the effect of midostaurin on cardiac intervals in 192 healthy 
subjects. Twelve-lead digital ECGs were obtained in triplicate at 9 time points over 24 hours at the same 
relative time during baseline (Day -1) and on study Day 3, and at 2 time points on Day 1. Midostaurin or 
matching placebo was administered orally at 75 mg b.i.d. on days 1 and 2 and q.d. on day 3. Moxifloxacin 
400 mg tablets or placebo was administered orally o.d. on day 3.The maximum mean change in QTcF from 
baseline for midostaurin, compared to placebo, occurred at 24 hours post-dose on day 3 and was 0.715 ms 
and the upper bound of the 90% CI was 4.707 ms, which excluded 10ms. At day 3, mean (SD) Cmax values 
of midostaurin, CGP62221 and CGP52421 were 2273.3 (710.28), 1882.0 (432.47) and 1248.6 (208.36) 
ng/mL, respectively. Due to its short duration, this study was not meant to address directly the longacting 
metabolite CGP52421, which accumulates over 3 to 4 weeks. Therefore, the change from baseline in QTcF 
with the concentration of midostaurin and both metabolites was further explored in the Phase 2 study D2201 
in AdSM.  
Analyses were conducted between the exposure of midostaurin, CGP62221 and CGP52421, and QTcF interval 
using a time-matched concentration-QTcF change model. These analyses suggested no increase in QTcF 
change with increasing exposure of midostaurin, CGP62221 or CGP52421 (corresponding to QTcF slope 
estimates of -2.2817, -3.2888 and 0.1693 ms per ng/mL respectively). 
The effect of pharmacokinetic exposure of midostaurin, CGP62221 or CGP52421 was studied in relation to 
various clinical endpoints, including CR, DFS, EFS and OS. No significant associations were found for 
midostaurin and CGP52421 C1D21 PK on CR. There was a slight positive effect of CGP62221 exposure on 
response, suggesting a higher probability of response with higher CGP62221 exposure. A 50% decrease in 
CGP62221 (corresponding to a reduction from 50 mg b.i.d. to 25mg b.i.d.) exposure corresponded to a 
~29% reduction in the odds of response (OR: 0.71; 90%CI: 0.525-0.951). No relationship was observed for 
the sum of active moieties and response. No significant association was observed between midostaurin, 
CGP62221, and CGP52421 concentrations at C1D21 of induction therapy and EFS. Also no significant

associations were observed between midostaurin, CGP62221 or CGP52421 concentrations on Day 1 of Cycle 
8 of the continuation phase and OS or DFS. No significant association was observed between midostaurin or 
CGP52421 concentrations at C1D21 of induction therapy and OS in Study A2301. However, higher 
concentrations of CGP62221 were associated with a better OS (HR=1.37; 95% CI: 1.08-1.74, for a 2-fold 
decrease of CGP62221; p=0.009). Also, a trend towards increased OS was seen for higher midostaurin 
concentrations (HR for 2-fold decrease in midostaurin concentration 1.18 (95%CI: 0.98-1.43; p=0.083). 
The impact of midostaurin exposure (ASM/SM-AHN/MCL indication), was evaluated on BOR, DOR, serum 
tryptase level, and MCs.  No significant exposure-efficacy relationship was found between the Cmin C1D28 of 
midostaurin or its metabolites and the occurrence of response. However, a trend was found for higher peak 
Cmin values of midostaurin correlated with higher probability of response (OR for 2.67-fold decrease in 
midostaurin exposure: 0.37; 90%CI: 0.17-0.79). Analyses of DOR by Cmin exposure quartiles showed no 
obvious exposure-response relationship between last Cmin and the DOR. 
No significant association between the Cmin C1D28 of the three active moieties and the maximum % change 
from baseline of MCs was established within the exposure range of a daily midostaurin dose of 100 mg b.i.d.. 
However, a decrease in the maximum change from baseline in serum tryptase was highly correlated with the 
peak Cmin of midostaurin and the exposure to the sum of active moieties when analysed with a linear 
regression model (midostaurin: estimate -81, 90%CI: -139 to -22.8, p=0.0230; sum of active moieties: 
estimate -86.6, 90%CI: -153 to -20.2, p=0.0328).  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
There were 4 formulations of midostaurin used in PK studies, in which bioequivalence has been investigated 
among three mainly used formulations with and without food. The commercial formulation (FMI) gave slightly 
higher exposure than CSF2 and oral solution under fasting conditions. This small difference is not expected to 
have impact on PK investigation. Bioequivalence with food has been demonstrated between FMI and oral 
solution.  
Overall, PK of midostaurin is complex; it is dose and time dependent. Midostaurin is a compound with good 
absorption and poor solubility (BCS class II). Two of its metabolites demonstrated pharmacological activities 
(CGP52421 and CGP62221). Following multiple doses, the pharmacokinetics of midostaurin and CGP62221 
were time dependent, with an initial increase observed in the first week followed by a decline of 
concentrations until reaching steady state on day 28. CGP52421 concentrations do not appear to decline as 
significantly as for midostaurin and CGP62221 (SmPC, section 5.2). In humans, the absorption of midostaurin 
was rapid after oral administration, with Tmax of total radioactivity observed at 1 3 hours post dose (SmPC, 
section 5.2).The population pharmacokinetic analysis did not identify any change in the absorption 
characteristics in patients after multiple dose administration (SmPC, section 5.2). The absolute bioavailability 
of midostaurin following oral administration is not known (SmPC, section 5.2). The 81.6% total recovery of 
radioactivity in the mass balance study with only 3.4% being parent compound seems high absorption.  
In healthy subjects, after administration of a single dose of 50 mg midostaurin with food, AUC of midostaurin 
was increased to 20800 ng*h/ml and Cmax was decreased to 963 ng/ml. Similarly, for CGP52421 and 
CGP62221 AUC increased to 19000 and 29200 ng*h/ml and Cmax decreased to 172 and 455 ng/ml, 
respectively. Time to peak concentration was also delayed in the presence of a high fat meal. Tmax was 
delayed for all entities, midostaurin median Tmax was 3 h, and for CGP52421 and CGP62221 Tmax was 
delayed to 6 and 7 hours respectively (SmPC, section 5.2).

As Cmax level is considered relevant to the safety profile of midostaurin and food is mainly important to 
achieve optimal AUC, midostaurin is recommended to be taken with food, which was applied also in all clinical 
efficacy studies. 
The volume of distribution of midostaurin was high indicating tissue distribution. Midostaurin and the active 
metabolites were highly bound to plasma proteins (>99%). Midostaurin was mainly metabolised by CYP3A4 
and metabolites were excreted via fecel route mainly (77.6% in feces and 4 % via urine).  
The average of terminal elimination half-life of midostaurin was estimated to be 19-25 hours, 29-39 hours, 
and 16-31 days for midostaurin, CGP62221 and CGP52421, respectively, following a single oral dose of 50 
mg. Following single dose administration under fasting conditions, midostaurin and its metabolites showed no 
major deviation from dose-proportionality in the range of 25 mg to 100 mg although the rate of absortion 
seemed somewhat less than dose proportional. This might be due to poor solubility of midostaurin. It should 
be noted that in simulated intestinal fluid the solubility of midostaurin was increased by food intake from 0.07 
mg/ml (fasted) to 0.12 mg/ml (fed). A pooled analysis of single dose data from healthy subjects under 
fasting conditions showed less than dose proportional increase of AUC and Cmax between 50 mg and 100 mg 
dose. However, the PK data of the 100 mg single dose was only from 7 subjects. Thus, the single dose 
proportionality of midostaurin is still inconclusive. After multiple doses with food, there was a less than 
dose-proportional increase in exposure within the dose range of 50 mg to 225 mg daily. In AML patients the 
exposure following 50 mg b.i.d. and 100 mg b.i.d. was comparable. The less than dose-proportional 
pharmacokinetics of midostaurin in AML patients could be due to a combination of reduced absorption and 
increased auto-induction at the higher dose. 
In general, midostaurin and its metabolites showed no major deviation from dose proportionality after a 
single dose in the range of 25 mg to 100 mg. However, there was a less than dose proportional increase in 
exposure after multiple doses within the dose range of 50 mg to 225 mg daily (SmPC, section 5.2). 
Following multiple oral doses, midostaurin displayed time dependent pharmacokinetics with an initial increase 
in plasma concentrations during the first week (peak Cmin) followed by a decline with time to a steady state 
after approximately 28 days (2.5 fold decrease). While the exact mechanism for the declining concentration 
of midostaurin is unclear, it is likely due to the auto induction properties of midostaurin and its two active 
metabolite CGP52421 and CGP62221 on CYP3A4. The pharmacokinetics of the CGP62221 metabolite showed 
a similar trend. However, CGP52421 concentrations increased up to 2.5 fold for ASM, SM AHN and MCL and 
up to 9 fold for AML, compared to midostaurin after one month of treatment (SmPC, section 5.2). 
At steady state midostaurin and CGP62221 exposures were not different in AML and AdSM patients, whereas 
CGP52421 concentrations were 4-fold higher in patients with AML with dose of 100 mg b.i.d., compared to 
patients with AdSM. In AML patients, the dose of 100 mg b.i.d. was reduced to 50 mg b.i.d. due to 
gastrointestinal side effects. Exposure to midostaurin and CGP62221 were comparable for 50 mg b.i.d and 
100 mg b.i.d while CGP52421 concentrations were 1.6-fold higher at 100 mg bid than 50 mg bid. Overall the 
safety profile with 50 mg b.i.d. was not better than 100 mg b.i.d. The dose of 50 mg b.i.d. is recommended 
to the patients with AML, and 100 mg b.i.d. is recommended to the patients with AdSM (SmPC section 4.2).  
According to popPK analyses, except CYP3A4 inhibitor no covariates were identified to have effect on 
clearance of midostaurin. There was a slight decrease in exposure of midostaurin and metabolites (7 to 22%) 
in females compared to males.  This difference in exposure is too small to explain the differential treatment 
effect observed for females vs. males (see discussion on clinical efficacy). For hepatic impairment, the 
bioavailability of midostaurin in moderate hepatic impairment was decreased but the elimination half-life was 
longer at day 7, compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. At Day 7, exposure of midostaurin was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/516229/2017 
Page 65/209 
 
  
  
not different in subject with moderate hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects. In the study, there 
was approximately 40% reduction in drug exposure in patients with mild hepatic impairment, which is likely 
due to the reduction in absorption. After multiple dosing, the decrease in exposure was 28% in subjects with 
mild hepatic impairment. Thus dose adjustment is not needed for mild and moderate hepatic impairment. No 
data in patients with severe hepatic impairment are available and this has been adequately mentioned in the 
SmPC. The applicant committed to submit the results of study A2116, an open label, multiple dose study 
designed to evaluate the PK of midostaurin in subjects with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment 
compared to matched healthy subjects, which is ongoing (see Risk Management Plan). 
Based on the popPK analyses, creatinine clearance (as surrogate for renal function) showed no impact on the 
PK of midostaurin and its active metabolites. Justification for lack of pharmacokinetic study for severe renal 
impairment is accepted, as only 4% of the drug excreted in urine, no study is needed for renal impairment.  
Drug-drug interactions have been evaluated in vitro and in vivo for midostaurin. Midostaurin and metabolites 
are mainly substrate for CYP3A4. Co-administration of both strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and inducer had a 
significant effect on exposure of midostaurin and also the active metabolites.  
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase midostaurin blood concentrations. In a study with 36 healthy 
subjects, co administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole to steady state with a single dose of 
50 mg midostaurin led to a significant increase in midostaurin exposure (1.8 fold Cmax increase and 10 fold 
AUCinf increase) and 3.5 fold increase in AUCinf of CGP62221, while the Cmax of the active metabolites 
(CGP62221 and CGP52421) decreased by half. At steady state of midostaurin (50 mg twice daily for 21 
days), with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole at steady state in a subset of patients (N=7), 
midostaurin steady state exposure (Cmin) was increased by 2.09 fold. Cmin of CGP52421 was increased by 
1.3 fold, whereas no significant effect in exposure of CGP62221 was observed (SmPC section 4.5). 
Due to the high interindividual variability in the effect of the CYP 3A4 inhibitor on midostaurin exposure (no 
increase up to 4-fold increase) a general dose reduction cannot be recommended.   
Caution is required when concomitantly prescribing with midostaurin medicinal products that are strong 
inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as, but not limited to, antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole), certain antivirals (e.g. 
ritonavir), macrolide antibiotics (e.g. clarithromycin) and nefazodone because they can increase the plasma 
concentrations of midostaurin especially when (re )starting with midostaurin treatment. Alternative medicinal 
products that do not strongly inhibit CYP3A4 activity should be considered. In situations where satisfactory 
therapeutic alternatives do not exist, patients should be closely monitored for midostaurin related toxicity 
(SmPC, section 4.4).  
Strong CYP3A4 inducers decrease exposure of midostaurin and its active metabolites (CGP52421 and 
CGP62221). In a study in healthy subjects, co administration of the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin (600 
mg daily) to steady state with a 50 mg single dose of midostaurin decreased midostaurin Cmax by 73% and 
AUCinf by 96% on average, respectively. CGP62221 exhibited a similar pattern. The mean AUClast of 
CGP52421 decreased by 60% (SmPC section 4.5) Concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers, 
e.g. rifampicin, St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum), carbamazepine, enzalutamide, phenytoin is 
contraindicated (SmPC, section 4.3). 
Based on in vitro data, midostaurin and/or its metabolites have the potential to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2D6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5 enzymes (SmPC section 4.5). 
Inhibition of CYP3A5 in vitro by midostaurin and its metabolites is lacking and the CHMP recommended the 
applicant to investigate it in-vitro. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/516229/2017 
Page 66/209 
 
  
  
Based on in vitro data, midostaurin and/or its metabolites have the potential to induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 enzymes. Midostaurin inhibited OATP1B1, BCRP and P glycoprotein 
(P gp) in vitro. The combination of data on in vivo midostaurin auto induction upon repeated dosing and 
increase in plasma 4β OH cholesterol levels suggest that midostaurin may be at least a moderate CYP3A4 
inducer in vivo (SmPC section 4.5). 
Drug-drug interactions with substrates for CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2B6, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 
and oral contraceptives have been categorized as potential risk (see Risk Management Plan). 
Potential interactions with transporters and CYP2D6 were already demonstrated in vitro. The applicant 
committed to conduct in vivo studies at single dose level in order to investigate the impact of a single dose of 
midostaurin on the PK of substrates of the transporters P-gp and BCRP.  Addition of a sensitive substrate of 
CYP2D6 to evaluate the inhibitory effect of midostaurin in a single dose study was also required (see Risk 
Management Plan). The drug-drug interactions with OATP1B1, P-gp, BCRP and BSEP transporter substrates 
have been categorized as potential risk (see Risk Management Plan). 
A study to examine the inhibitory effect of midostaurin and CGP62221 and CGP52421 on BSEP efflux is 
planned and will be submitted by the applicant (see Risk Management Plan). 
In vivo studies have not been conducted for the investigation of induction and inhibition of enzymes and 
transporters by midostaurin and the active metabolites. Medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic range 
that are substrates of CYP1A2 (e.g. tizanidine), CYP2D6 (e.g. codeine), CYP2C8 (e.g. paclitaxel), CYP2C9 
(e.g. warfarin), CYP2C19 (e.g. omeprazole), CYP2E1 (e.g. chlorzoxazone), CYP3A4/5 (e.g. tacrolimus), 
CYP2B6 (e.g. efavirenz), P gp (e.g. paclitaxel), BCRP (e.g. atorvastatin) or OATP1B1 (e.g. digoxin) should be 
used with caution when administered concomitantly with midostaurin and may need dose adjustment to 
maintain optimal exposure. (SmPC section 4.5). 
The impact of midostaurin on the PK of a substrate of OATP1B1 transporters based on dynamic modeling of 
the steadystate concentrations of midostaurin, CGP52421 and CGP62221 will be assessed in a planned study 
(see Risk Management Plan). 
It is currently unknown whether midostaurin may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, and 
therefore women using hormonal contraceptives should add a barrier method of contraception (SmPC section 
4.5). 
No interaction studies except for an interaction study with midazolam have been conducted to investigate the 
interaction potential of midostaurin as a perpetrator in vivo.  The interaction study with midazolam indicated 
that midostaurin was not a moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor in vivo, whereas the inducing effect of 
CYP3A4 was uncertain because of the short, 3 days, treatment with midostaurin (SmPC section 4.5).  
The available data on PK interactions indicated that there is a high risk of midostaurin affecting the PK of 
other drugs through induction of CYP enzymes, including CYP3A4/5. As a result, midostaurin is likely to 
negatively affect the efficacy of many co-medications that are administered to patients with AML. Drugs that 
are prone to reduced efficacy (e.g. CYP3A4 substrates) were administered at a very high frequency in the 
pivotal study of Rydapt (>60% when CYP3A4/5 is considered alone, and even higher when other enzymes 
are also considered), and these drugs include those which are critical for the safety and well-being of AML, 
including anti-infective drugs for treatment of infections, and anti-emetics for treatment of nausea/vomiting. 
To assure that midostaurin treatment does not negatively affect the well-being of AML patients by affecting 
PK of many co-administered drugs which are critical for optimal treatment of these patients, the applicant 
commited to investigate the impact of midostaurin on the PK of a cocktail of the following CYP substrates: 
CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. The impact on these CYP will be investigated after 28 days of treatment.

These three CYP are considered as the most sensitive to midostaurin. The results will then be extrapolated on 
the other CYPs and will be submitted by December 2020 (see Risk Management Plan). The CHMP also 
recommended the applicant to submit PK data for the supportive trial ADE02T. 
Limited clinical pharmacodynamic data were provided to support target engagement of FLT3 by midostaurin 
and its metabolites in patients with AML. It is unclear to which degree FLT3 is inhibited at the concentrations 
achieved at the recommended dose of 50 mg b.i.d. (apart from extrapolation using an IC50 values in vitro). 
In the pivotal phase III trial in AML patients (PKC412A2301), no formal pharmacodynamic analyses were 
conducted. The geometric mean Cycle 1 day 21 predose concentrations in this study was 3760.80 ng/mL. 
This would lead to unboud concentrations of >65 nM (assuming protein binding of 99%). These are above the 
IC50 values needed to inhibit mutant and wild type FLT3. However, variability in exposure was large, ranging 
from 0 to 33700 ng/mL, possibly leading to subtherapeutic concentrations in a subset of patients.  
The relevance of FLT3 mutational status (TKD versus ITD) and allelic ratios of ITD is unclear. Overall, the 
limited clinical pharmacodynamic data provided suggest FLT3 engagement but the degree of target 
engagement in patients is unclear. The limited available data, combined with the low specificity of 
midostaurin for FLT3 make that there is limited clinical evidence supporting that the effect of midostaurin in 
AML is specifically due to inhibition of FLT3, and the contribution of inhibition of other kinases is unclear. 
No pharmacodynamic studies were submitted to support the primary pharmacology in ASM. In study 
PKC412D2201 (pivotal study in ASM), the 100 mg b.i.d. dose resulted in a mean (SD) midostaurin Cmax of 
3044.71 (964.249) ng/mL on cycle 1 day 1. This would lead to unbound concentrations of >50 nM (assuming 
protein binding of 99%), well above the IC50 values needed to inhibit mutant KIT 7.7 nM, but below the IC50 
of wild type KIT (600 nM). 
In the pivotal trial in ASM/SM-AHN/MCL (PKC412D2201), KIT D816V mutation was positively associated with 
OS. The mechanism of this association (prognostic in ASM or predictive of response to midostaurin) is 
unclear. However, the latter hypothesis (predictive association) is supported by the markedly lower affinity of 
midostaurin for wild type KIT receptor and the fact that in literature KIT mutational status was found to have 
no prognostic role in ASM (Lim, Tefferi, et al., 2009).  
Overall, the in vitro and non-clinical rationale for FLT3 inhibition in AML and KIT inhibition in ASM/SM-
AHN/MCL are reasonably justified. However, limited clinical pharmacodynamic data confirmed the effect of 
midostaurin on FLT3 and KIT in patients.  
In study PKC412D2201 (pivotal study in ASM), the 100 mg b.i.d. dose resulted in a mean (SD) midostaurin 
Cmax of 3044.71 (964.249) ng/mL on cycle 1 day 1 (with individual patients reaching concentrations of up to 
5150.0 ng/mL). The geometric mean (CV%) Cmin of CGP52421 was 2518.50 (39.06) ng/mL at day 28 and the 
geometric mean (CV%) Cmin of CGP62221 was 3194.15 ng/mL on day 8. Given that pharmacokinetic 
exposure in trial PKC412A2113 was lower than at the Applicant’s highest proposed dose of 100 mg b.i.d. at 
steady state, the dedicated QT trial insufficiently predicts the cardiac safety profile and exposure-safety 
relationship of midostaurin at steady state. 
In the ASM/SM-AHN/MCL pivotal study (D2201), 8.6% of patients had a dose reduction or interruption due to 
a prolonged QT interval. Moreover, 41 patients (39.0%) had a QTcF increase from baseline of at least 30 ms 
and 8 patients (7.6%) an increase of at least 60 ms. In the pivotal study in AML (A2301), the overall 
frequency of QT prolongation events was 19.2% for midostaurin and 16.8% in the placebo arm (for further 
discussion see safety section).

EMA/CHMP/516229/2017 
Page 68/209 
 
  
  
A dedicated QT study in 192 healthy subjects with a dose of 75 mg twice daily did not reveal clinically 
significant prolongation of QT by midostaurin and CGP62221 but the study duration was not long enough to 
estimate the QTc prolongation effects of the long acting metabolite CGP52421. Therefore, the change from 
baseline in QTcF with the concentration of midostaurin and both metabolites was further explored in a phase 
II study in 116 patients with ASM, SM AHN or MCL. At the median peak Cmin concentrations attained at a 
dose of 100 mg twice daily, neither midostaurin, CGP62221 nor CGP52421 showed a potential to cause 
clinically significant QTcF prolongation, since the upper bounds of predicted change at these concentration 
levels were less than 10 msecs (6.3, 2.4, and 4.7 msecs, respectively). In the ASM, SM-AHN and MCL 
population, 25.4% of patients had at least one ECG measurement with a QTcF greater than 450 ms and 4.7% 
greater than 480 ms (SmPC, section 5.1). 
Different exposure-response analyses in AML were performed with dose intensity as a predictor and clinical 
endpoints including EFS and OS as investigated outcomes. These analyses are considered methodologically 
unsound as dose intensity has a reciprocal relationship with the clinical endpoints (i.e. EFS affects dose 
intensity and vice versa). The fact that treatment failure (or toxicity) lead to lower dose intensity may create 
an artificial correlation between dose intensity and e.g. EFS; hence biasing the association. Analyses between 
PK and clinical endpoints are considered more robust.  
No specific pharmacodynamic interaction studies have been discussed. Midostaurin is likely to interact 
pharmacodynamically with cytostatic and cytotoxic agents, and thereby increase the risk of adverse events 
related to immunosuppression including infections. The results in terms of safety profile of pharmacodynamic 
interactions between midostaurin and the cytotoxic agents used in AML, specifically anthracyclines and 
cytarabine, are discussed in the safety section. 
NPM1 status does not affect the treatment effect of midostaurin, and midostaurin is effective both in NPM1 
mutated and NPM1 wildtype FLT3-mutated disease. Midostaurin is metabolised to a large extent via CYP3A4. 
CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 polymorphisms are likely to have a large impact on PK of midostaurin (and metabolites). 
Therefore, these polymorphisms might also have an impact on the B/R of midostaurin in genetic 
subpopulations. Pharmacogenetics data are required to determine whether dose adjustments are required in 
patients carrying CYP3A4/CYP3A5 variants that lead to reduced enzyme activity. Effect of genomic 
polymorphisms of CYP3A4/CYP3A5 on pharmacokinetics of midostaurin and potential risk of treatment-
related toxicity and effect on efficacy is classified as missing information in the risk management plan. The 
applicant will conduct a pharmacogenetics association study (PKC412E2301) in newly diagnosed AML patients 
with wild-type FLT3 to determine the impact of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 polymorphisms on the exposure of 
midostaurin, CGP52421 and CGP62221, and on treatment-related toxicity (see Risk Management Plan). The 
effect of genomic polymorphisms of CYP3A4/CYP3A5 on pharmacokinetics of midostaurin and potential risk of 
treatment-related toxicity has been categorized as potential risk (see Risk Management Plan). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of midostaurin and the active metabolites has been investigated to a reasonable 
extent. PK data indicated that the risk of midostaurin affecting other drugs due to induction of CYP enzymes 
is high (including induction of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2B6), and midostaurin is thus likely to 
affect the efficacy of many co-medications, including e.g. anti-emetics and anti-infective drugs. This will be 
followed through post-marketing studies (see Risk Management Plan).

Acute myeloid leukaemia indication 
A dose-escalation study of midostaurin as monotherapy (study 0002) was conducted in patients with non-
haematological malignancies, where patients received midostaurin for 28 days (in a 4 week on, 1 week off 
schedule) at one of 7 dose levels, ranging from 12.5 to 300 mg daily (as 100 mg t.i.d.). The maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) was not determined. Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events included nausea, 
fatigue, anaemia, anorexia, vomiting, headache, increased sweating, coughing and arthralgia. No clear 
relationship between dose and these toxicities could be shown. No dose-response relations were identified in 
this study, as only one patient (3%) had a partial response (a cholangiosarcoma patient who was treated at 
the 12.5 mg dose level). The dose of 225 mg/day was considered to be the maximum feasible dose due to a 
slightly increased number of grade 3 gastrointestinal events (nausea and vomiting) causing discontinuation in 
patients receiving 225-300 mg/day, and the fact that ingestion of 12 or more capsules (as only 25 mg 
capsules are produced) per day (at the 300 mg dose) was deemed unpractical from a patient perspective. 
A phase II study in patients with advanced CLL or NHL (study 0006) evaluated doses of 25, 150, and 225 
mg/day in a continuous schedule, which confirmed the tolerability of midostaurin as single agent at doses up 
to 225 mg/day. The median overall duration of exposure was 41 days (range: 14-93). 
A phase II monotherapy study (study 2104) evaluated continuous daily dosing of 225 mg (75 mg t.i.d.) 
midostaurin in patients with FLT3 mutant (FLT3-ITD mutation or D835Y TKD mutation) AML or high-risk MDS. 
At this dose, 30% of the patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events. The median duration of 
treatment was 35.5 days. None of the patients had a CR or PR, but 15 patients (out of a total of 20) had a 
blast reduction (greater than 50% reduction in peripheral blasts).  
Study 2104E1 evaluated 50 mg b.i.d. and 100 mg b.i.d. continuous regimens of midostaurin (as single agent) 
in patients with AML or high-risk MDS, either FLT3-mutated or wild type. The results showed that there was 
little difference between the exposures to midostaurin (measured as pre-dose concentrations) at the two 
dose levels, and indicated a less-than-proportional increase in exposure with increasing dose within this dose 
range. Clinical activity and a similar response rate were observed in the 50 mg b.i.d. and 100 b.i.d. dose 
groups in patients with FLT3 mutations. A clinical response was observed in most patients with FLT3-mutated 
AML (71.4%) but also in more than half of the patients with FLT3-wild-type AML (56.1%). 
Study 2104E2 evaluated two dosing regimens: intra-patient dose-escalation of midostaurin up to a maximum 
of 600 mg/day in a continuous regimen, and the effect of concomitant administration of itraconazole (100 mg 
b.i.d.) with midostaurin 50 mg b.i.d.  In patients with FLT3-mutated AML, a clinical response in the 
midostaurin dose escalation arm was achieved in five (55.6%) patients (95%CI: 21.2%-86.3%), and for 
each patient this comprised blast reduction alone or in combination with MR. No patients with FLT3-mutated 
AML in the midostaurin + itraconazole arm achieved a clinical response. In patients with FLT3-wild-type AML, 
a clinical response in the midostaurin dose escalation arm was achieved in two (28.6%) patients (95% CI: 
3.7%, 71.0%) and in the midostaurin + itraconazole arm a clinical response was obtained in four (66.7%) 
patients (95% CI: 22.3%-95.7%). One patient (16.7%) in the FLT3-wild-type group obtained a CR in the 
midostaurin + itraconazole treatment arm. The data from this study did not indicate obvious improvements in 
clinical response in patients with AML receiving midostaurin doses higher than 50 mg b.i.d.. 
Study 2106 was a phase IB, open-label study to determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of twice daily 
oral dosing of midostaurin combination sequentially or concomitantly with standard induction chemotherapy 
in AML. In this study (which enrolled 69 patients), dosages of 100 mg b.i.d. and 50 mg b.i.d. where explored 
in combination with induction therapy (daunorubicin 60 mg/m2/day IV over 30 min for 3 days on days 1-3

Page 71/209 
 
  
  
and cytarabine 200 mg/m2/day IV over 24 hours for 7 days on days 1-7). Sequential (arm 1) and 
concomitant (arm 2) dosing of midostaurin in relation to chemotherapy was explored.  The initial dosing 
regimen of midostaurin 100 mg b.i.d. was poorly tolerated both in sequential and concomitant regimens and 
was associated with a high rate of treatment discontinuation (71.4% in arm 1 and 85.7-87.5% in arm 2 of 
which 14.3% in both arms due to adverse events). The most common reasons for discontinuation were 
unsatisfactory therapeutic effect and withdrawal of consent. Protocol amendments were implemented that 
reduced the midostaurin dosage from the initial 100 mg b.i.d. to 50 mg b.i.d. Administration of midostaurin 
50 mg b.i.d. was associated with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile (corresponding to 
discontinuation rates, due to any reason, of 35% in arm 1 and 55% in arm 2). Discontinuation due to 
adverse events at the 50 mg b.i.d. dosage occurred in 5 and 10% in arm 1 and 2, respectively. There was no 
clear difference in the incidence of most SAEs between the cohorts within each treatment arm. However, the 
SAEs of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were only reported in the 100 mg b.i.d. cohorts, as were SAEs 
associated with increases in liver function test results (ALT, AST, total bilirubin). No effect of midostaurin was 
observed on cytarabine plasma concentrations whereas exposure to daunorubicin appeared to decrease 2-
fold at the 100 mg b.i.d. midostaurin dose. However, due to the large variability in the PK parameters for 
daunorubicin it was not possible to conclude that this decrease was caused by a drug-drug interaction. The 
CR rate was 52.9% and 60.0% in Arm 1 and Arm 2, respectively. The CR rate was higher in the 50 mg b.i.d. 
cohorts in each arm (60.0% and 75.0% in the respective arms). Overall, the CR rate was higher for patients 
with FLT3 mutation positive AML (78.9%) than patients with wild type FLT3 AML (48.0%). The median OS 
was also longer in patients with FLT3 mutation positive AML (~2.9 years), compared to those with wild type 
FLT3 AML (~1.7 years).  
Aggressive systemic mastocytosis indication 
No dose selection studies were conducted in ASM (see discussion on clinical efficacy).

Treatments 
Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to standard first-line induction and consolidation chemotherapy with 
daunorubicin/cytarabine and high-dose cytarabine, plus either placebo or midostaurin (50 mg twice daily). 
Patients were stratified based on FLT3 mutation status (ITD allelic ratio < 0.7, ITD allelic ratio ≥  0.7, or 
TKD). Midostaurin or placebo were administered during induction and consolidation treatment, and as 
maintenance treatment up to 12 cycles of 28 days (336 days) after finishing consolidation therapy in patients 
who remained in CR.  
The study comprised 3 treatment phases, as shown in Error! Reference source not found.. 
Induction: In Cycle 1, patients received induction therapy with cytarabine (200 mg/m2/day on Days 
• 
1-7) and daunorubicin (60 mg/m2/day on Days 1-3). Midostaurin or placebo was administered on Days 8-21. 
Patients who achieved a CR were to proceed to consolidation therapy while those who failed to achieve a CR 
(bone marrow aspirate with ≥  5% leukaemic blasts in a cellular marrow) were to receive a second course of 
the same remission-induction therapy starting on or shortly after Day 24 (i.e., ≥  3 days after completing 
midostaurin/placebo).  
After the induction therapy, a bone-marrow aspiration was performed within one week after haematological 
recovery (absolute neutrophil count; ANC ≥  1000/µL and platelets ≥  100000/µL) to assess response. 
Patients with residual AML after cycle 2 were to be discontinued from study treatment.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/516229/2017 
Page 73/209 
 
  
  
 
Consolidation: Patients who achieved CR during induction received up to four 28-day cycles of 
• 
consolidation therapy with high-dose cytarabine (3 g/m2 over 3 hours every 12 hours on Days 1, 3, and 5) 
and continued midostaurin or placebo on Days 8-21 of each cycle (Cycles 2-5 or 3-6).  
• 
Continuation/maintenance: Patients who remained in CR after 4 cycles of consolidation therapy 
received midostaurin or placebo administered continuously for a maximum of 12 cycles of 28-days (i.e. up to 
336 days). 
Patients who received SCT were discontinued from study treatment; however they were continued to be 
followed for efficacy (response/survival). There was no crossover between treatment arms. 
Design of study A2301/RATIFY (pivotal phase III study) 
FLT3 screening 
Patients were screened at diagnosis for the presence of a FLT3 mutation (ITD or TKD) in either bone marrow 
or peripheral blood blast cells using a polymerase chain reaction based method performed at one of nine 
designated central laboratories. The cut-off for FLT3 positivity was set at 0.05 (mutant:wild type ratio 
calculated using the signal output from the assay), i.e., patients were classified as FLT3 positive if ≥ 5% 
mutated FLT3 alleles were present in blasts. Test assay performance was regularly monitored (every 6 
months) throughout the study at these participating central labs through the use of cross-validation panel 
testing. Laboratory failure resulted in suspension until CTA proficiency was demonstrated in the following 
round. Patient samples were diverted to other laboratories for testing during suspensions.

Objectives  
Primary objective: To determine if the addition of midostaurin to daunorubicin/cytarabine induction, high-
dose cytarabine consolidation, and continuation therapy improves overall survival (OS) in both the mutant 
FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD AML patients. 
Key secondary objective: To determine if the addition of midostaurin to daunorubicin/cytarabine induction, 
high-dose cytarabine consolidation, and continuation therapy improves event-free survival (EFS) in both the 
mutant FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD AML patients. 
Other secondary objectives: 
•

Sample size 
In December 2010, the sample size calculation was revised (protocol amendment 4) based on a blinded 
review of the data. The proportion of FLT3-TKD patients was expected to increase from 14% to 26% and the 
proportion of patients receiving SCT to increase from 15% to 25%. Taking into account these new 
proportions and that no additional benefit of midostaurin would be observed for patients receiving SCT, the 
expected median OS times for placebo and midostaurin were considered to be 16.3 months and 20.9 months, 
respectively (HR=0.78). The study was determined to be underpowered (68%) and the sample size was 
increased to accrue a total of 714 patients, with a 2.9 years accrual period and 1.6 years of follow-up period. 
Within this timeframe, it was expected to observe 509 OS events by May 2013, to attain a power of 84% to 
detect a HR of 0.78, with a one-sided test at an overall one-sided alpha level of 0.025.  
In March 2015 it was decided to perform the primary analysis based on 350 OS events. The death rate was 
lower than expected, and the protocol was amended (protocol amendment 10) to perform the final 
confirmatory analysis with a data cut-off of 1 April 2015 without waiting for the originally targeted 509 OS 
events to occur.  
After amendment 4, type I error control was extended to include EFS as key secondary endpoint. Based on 
external trial data (SWOG/AMLSG), median EFS of 8.5 months was estimated for placebo patients. If it was 
assumed a median EFS of 14 months for midostaurin patients (3 additional months in remission for patients 
who were not long-term survivors, 8% increase in the rate of long term survivors and no treatment 
difference for the patients who had an SCT in CR1), 507 EFS events could have been observed with a 
minimum follow up of 3.5 years for all patients after randomization. Under these assumptions, the trial would 
have a power of approximately 89% using a one-sided alpha of 2.5% for the key secondary endpoint to 
detect a hazard ratio of 1.34 with a Cox regression model. 
Randomisation 
All AML FLT3 mutated patients were randomly assigned to the two treatments based on FLT3 mutation 
status: FLT3 TKD (No ITD), ITD Allelic ratio<0.7 (with or without FLT3 TKD) and ITD Allelic ratio≥ 0.7 (with 
or without FLT3 TKD). 
Blinding (masking) 
The pivotal study was double-blinded.  
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy endpoint was OS and all deaths up to and including the cut-off date of 1 April 2015 was 
taken into account as OS events. All patients irrespective of when they stopped study treatment or received 
SCT were followed up for this endpoint. Patients alive at study termination were censored either at their date 
of last contact before 1 April 2015 (cut-off data) or at cut-off date. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/516229/2017 
Page 77/209 
 
  
  
The primary efficacy evaluation tested the superiority of midostaurin compared to placebo on OS in the ITT 
population. The ITT population included all randomized patients with a signed protocol informed consent. 
Patients were analysed according to the treatment arm and stratum they were assigned to at randomization. 
The following statistical methodology was applied: 
• 
Log-rank test, adjusting for the FLT3 mutation strata used in the randomization, was used to test the 
null hypothesis and calculate the one-sided p-value 
•  Stratified Cox regression models adjusting according to the FLT3 mutation strata were used to 
provide estimates of the HRs and associated Wald 95% CIs 
•  Kaplan-Meier plots were used to depict OS over time in each treatment arm. Median survival was 
obtained along with 95% Cis calculated using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley. Kaplan-Meier 
estimates with 95% Cis at specific time points were summarized every 6 months using Greenwood’s 
formula for the standard error of the Kaplan-Meier estimate 
The test OS was significant if the associated one-sided p-value was less than the remaining alpha available 
considering the alpha already spent at the interim analysis. 
A pre-specified alpha level of 0.005 was to be spent at the interim analysis, meaning the one-sided test of OS 
was significant if the p-value was less than 0.005. The one-sided alpha level in the final analysis of the 
primary endpoint OS was determined to be 0.0239 to maintain the pre-specified overall alpha level of 0.025 
A conditional probability of less than 0.10 was ground for stopping the study early for futility. Conditional 
power was calculated as the probability of having a significant p-value at the primary analysis assuming an 
underlying HR of 0.78 on OS, given the observed effect at the futility look. 
Analysis sets 
The full analysis set (FAS) included all randomized patients with a signed protocol informed consent to whom 
a treatment arm was assigned by Alliance at randomization. Patients were analysed according to the 
treatment arm and the stratum they were assigned to at randomization. The FAS was used for the analyses 
of the efficacy endpoints and also for all baseline characteristics.  
The per protocol set (PPS) is a subset of the FAS, and included all randomized patients with a signed protocol 
treatment informed consent, who received at least one dose of study drug (midostaurin/placebo), and who 
had no major protocol deviation regarding inclusion/exclusion criteria or randomization issues that could 
affect response to treatment. Sensitivity analyses of the primary and the key secondary efficacy endpoints 
were produced on the PPS by region.  
The safety set included all patients with a signed protocol informed consent who received at least one dose of 
study drug (midostaurin or placebo). The safety set was used for the analyses of the safety endpoints, 
concomitant medications and treatment exposure. 
The Pharmacokinetic set (PK set) included all patients with a signed protocol and PK informed consent, who 
received at least one dose of midostaurin and who provided at least one evaluable PK concentration. The PK 
set was used for the analyses of the PK endpoints.

Numbers analysed 
Table 33. Analysis sets (All randomized patients)-Study A2301 
A total of 3279 patients were screened, and 719 patients were randomised in Study A2301. Two patients 
were excluded due to informed consent form issues at the site, resulting in 717 patients included in the 
analyses. Of the 717 patients in the full analysis set (FAS), 709 patients – 355 vs. 354 in the midostaurin and 
placebo arms, respectively – received at least one dose of study treatment (cytarabine, daunorubicin, or 
midostaurin/placebo) in the induction phase. 81 patients in the midostaurin arm and 101 patients in the 
placebo arm received a second cycle of induction therapy. 
A total of 441 patients (231 vs. 210 in the midostaurin and placebo arms, respectively) received 
consolidation therapy, and 129 and 103 patients (midostaurin and placebo, respectively) received all four 
cycles of consolidation treatment. 205 patients received continuation therapy (120 vs. 85 in the midostaurin 
and placebo arms, respectively), and 120 patients completed all study treatments per protocol (69 vs. 51 in 
the respective arms). 
All patients had completed study treatment (or discontinued) as of 2 August 2013, however patients 
continued to be followed for response and survival. The median time from date of randomisation to data cut-
off date (1April 2015) was 60.2 months in both treatment arms.

displayed Table 51. 
Table 49 Disease-free survival (CR within 60 days of study treatment start), non-censored at the 
time of SCT (FAS) 
Considering all CRs during induction (without 60 day restriction), the median DFS for patients in the 
midostaurin arm compared to the placebo arm was 28.1 months vs. 14.1 months, respectively. The risk of 
having a DFS event was reduced by 34% in favour of the midostaurin arm (HR=0.66; 95%CI: 0.52-0.85; 
p=0.0006, one-sided).  
When in the analysis of DFS there was censored for SCT, and considering all CRs in induction, the median 
DFS was longer in the midostaurin arm compared to the placebo arm (20.7 months vs. 14.5 months, 
respectively) (HR=0.72; 95%CI: 0.54-0.97). 
For patients who had an SCT in CR1, DFS was assessed after SCT. The risk of relapse or death was reduced 
by 48% for patients in the midostaurin arm (HR=0.52; 95%CI: 0.32-0.84).

Secondary endpoint – Stem cell transplantation rates 
Overall, 57% of patients underwent SCT, exceeding the pre-study estimated SCT rate of 15%, and revised 
rate (per protocol amendment no. 4) of 25%. The SCT rates were similar in the two treatment arms: 59.4% 
in the midostaurin arm and 55.2% in the placebo arm. The higher than anticipated transplant rates reflect 
the increasing use of SCT in clinical practice for higher risk AML patients during the course of this study. 
There were no major differences in SCT rate between treatment arms, or between the types of SCT used. 
Secondary endpoint – DFS after completion of one year continuation therapy 
DFS was assessed for all patients having a CR within 60 days of treatment initiation, and who had completed 
continuation therapy (i.e. had taken study drug for a minimum of 335 days) and were still in CR. The 
definition of DFS was modified to reflect time from end of continuation to relapse/death from any cause. This 
analysis included 59 patients in the midostaurin arm and 41 patients in the placebo arm. The estimated 
probability to be without an event at 1 year after completing continuation therapy for patients on midostaurin 
was 74% (95% CI: 0.61, 0.84) compared to 90% (95% CI: 0.76, 0.96) for patients on placebo (HR=1.42 
[95% CI: 0.63, 3.22]). 
Analyses to determine the effect of maintenance / continuation therapy 
An analysis to assess the benefit of maintenance/continuation therapy after consolidation therapy, by 
performing exploratory analyses comparing the patients entering continuation phase in the two arms for OS 
and DFS as measured from the start of the continuation phase (no re-randomisation prior to continuation 
therapy was performed in the study) was conducted. 
More patients in the midostaurin arm (n=120) than in the placebo arm (n=85) entered the continuation 
phase and were included in this analysis. Most patient and disease characteristics were balanced between the 
two treatment arms with the exception of fewer patients presenting with extramedullary disease in the 
midostaurin arm (19.2% to midostaurin arm vs. 28.2% to placebo arm). 
Overall survival was assessed from the start of the continuation phase (120 patients on midostaurin and 85 
patients on placebo). The HR was 0.80 (95%CI: 0.50-1.28). With 48 patients in the midostaurin arm and 24 
patients in the placebo arm censored for SCT, the HR was 0.47 (95%CI: 0.23-0.97).

(FAS) - Study A2301 
Genetic differences in PD response 
Analyses on the association between NPM1 and CEBPA mutations and response to midostaurin in patients 
with FLT3-mutated AML were submitted. Information on CEPBA mutation status was available in 236 
patients. Due to the low mutation rate (6/236 patients, 2.5%), analyses regarding CEBPA were not further 
pursued.  
The NPM1 analysis set (NPM1AS) was defined as all randomized patients from Study A2301 with a signed 
consent for research studies and NPM1 mutation status results, and included 563 patients (294 in the 
midostaurin arm and 269 in the placebo arm). Baseline disease characteristics and FLT3 mutation status 
were generally balanced across treatment arms within NPM1AS, and similar to the FAS. Fewer females 
randomized to the midostaurin arm (52.0% females) than the placebo arm (61.7% females). NPM1 
mutations were more frequent in females (201/319 patients, 63.0%) than males (123/244 patients, 50.4%), 
which is consistent with the higher incidence of NPM1 mutations in females reported in literature. Within the 
female population, there were 91/153 patients (59.5%) with NPM1 mutations in the midostaurin arm and 
110/166 patients (66.3%) with NPM1 mutations in the placebo arm. Within the male population there were

71/141 (50.4%) patients with NPM1 mutations in the midostaurin arm and 52/103 (50.5%) patients with 
NPM1 mutations in the placebo arm.  
Subgroup analyses in patients with known NPM1 status showed that OS and EFS benefit from midostaurin 
occurred in all subgroups of patients according to NPM1 status: NPM1 mutated, OS: HR 0.72 (95%CI: 0.52-
1.01), EFS: HR=0.73 (95% CI: 0.56-0.96); NPM1 wildtype, OS: HR 0.74 (95%CI: 0.54-1.03), EFS: HR=0.72 
(95% CI: 0.53-0.96) (data not shown). 
OS, EFS, CR and DFS by age groups (A2301) 
Several analyses were conducted to evaluate effect of age on efficacy outcomes in Study A2301.  The results 
of analyses of CR, EFS, DFS and OS for 5 subgroups defined by age are summarized in (Figure 18 ).

•  Study D2201 
Methods 
Study D2201 was a single arm, phase II, open-label study to determine the efficacy of 100 mg twice daily 
oral dosing of midostaurin administered to patients with aggressive systemic mastocytosis or mast cell 
leukaemia with or without an AHNMD. 
Patients were required to have a diagnosis of ASM or MCL with or without an AHNMD, and at least one 
measurable C-finding as per modified Valent/Cheson criteria.

• 
• 
Electrocardiogram (ECG) with a QTcF ≤ 450 ms 
Patients must have the following laboratory values: 
o  Aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 5 x upper limit of normal 
(ULN) if the elevation was solely due to ASM/SM-AHN/MCL ; otherwise AST, ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN 
o  Serum bilirubin ≤ 3x ULN if the elevation was solely due to ASM/MCL; otherwise serum 
bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN 
o  Serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL 
The diagnosis of SM was based on WHO criteria (Valent et al. 2001); the sub-variants of SM were defined 
using the algorithm according to WHO criteria as presented in Figure 19 
As shown in Figure 19, 1 major plus 1 minor, or 3 minor SM criteria were required for diagnosis of SM. 
•  Major criterion: Multifocal dense infiltrates of MCs (≥ 15 MCs in aggregates) in BM biopsies and/or in 
sections of other extracutaneous organ(s) 
•  Minor criteria: Greater than 25% of all MCs were atypical cells (type I or type II) on BM smears or 
were spindle-shaped in MC infiltrates detected on sections of visceral organs; KIT point mutation at 
codon 816 in the BM or another extracutaneous organ; MCs in BM or blood or another extracutaneous 
organ expressed CD2 or/and CD25; Baseline serum tryptase concentration >20 ng/mL (in the case of 
an associated myeloid neoplasm, not valid as an SM criterion) 
To be eligible, patients with ASM and MCL needed to have one or more of the following measurable C-
findings: 
o  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <1.0 x 109/L or hemoglobin <10 g/dL or platelets <100 x 
109/L 
o  Hepatomegaly with impaired liver function – i.e., elevated transaminases and/or bilirubin 
levels and/or hypoalbuminemia (with or without ascites or portal hypertension) 
o  Palpable splenomegaly with signs of hypersplenism (e.g., as documented by 
thrombocytopenia; platelets <100,000/μL) 
o  Malabsorption with hypoalbuminemia and/or significant weight loss – defined as ≥ 10% 
documented weight loss over the last 6 months 
Patients with non-measurable C-findings, such as skeletal lesions or hepatomegaly only with ascites or portal 
hypertension, were not permitted to be included in the study. 
For patients with MCL, the following criterion was required (in addition to the SM and ASM criteria mentioned 
above): BM aspirate smears with ≥ 20% immature MCs (± elevated peripheral blood MC percentage). 
Following protocol amendment, a C-finding was defined as a clinical finding which was considered attributable 
to the MC disease component and not to an AHNMD or any other cause. This was determined by the 
investigator and needed to be corroborated by the SSC chairperson or designee.  
It was left to the discretion of the investigator to determine whether a biopsy was required to evaluate 
whether the C-findings resulted from local MC infiltrates, from the AHNMD component, or both. Patients 
presenting with the C-finding of anaemia or thrombocytopenia and who were receiving RBC or platelet

transfusions were required to have another measurable C-finding present at study entry. An exception to this 
requirement was patients presenting with transfusion-dependent-anaemia (≥ 4 units of RBCs within 56 days 
of study start), who were allowed to enroll into the study even if they did not have any measurable C-finding 
including haemoglobin <10 g/dL. 
Patients with AHNMD were eligible to enter the study if the AHNMD was not life threatening or in an acute 
stage; otherwise, the patient was to be treated first for this disorder before being considered for entry into 
the study.

Patients who had ASM with eosinophilia and known positivity for the FIP1L1- PDGFRα fusion unless 
they had demonstrated relapse or disease progression on prior imatinib therapy 
Patients who had received hematopoietic growth factor support within 14 days of Day 1 of 
midostaurin treatment 
Patients with any pulmonary infiltrate, including those suspected to be of infectious origin. In 
particular, patients with resolution of clinical symptoms of pulmonary infection but with residual 
pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray were not eligible until the pulmonary infiltrates had completely 
resolved. Exception: patients with ASM/MCL ±AHNMD related pleural effusion as judged by the 
Investigator and approved by the SSC Chairperson or designee were permitted to enter the study 
Treatments 
Midostaurin was administered by oral dosing (i.e., 4 capsules of midostaurin 25 mg at each administration) 
beginning on day 1 and was to be taken with water following breakfast or dinner. Patients continued study 
drug until confirmed disease progression or discontinuation for any other reason.  
Patients were advised to swallow the capsules whole. An interval of approximately 12 hours between doses 
was recommended. If vomiting occurred, no re-dosing was allowed before the next scheduled dose. If a dose 
of midostaurin was missed by the patient, the missed dose was not to be taken, and the patient was to take 
the next scheduled dose. Other anticancer agents including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or biologic 
response modifiers were not permitted during the study. Where possible, investigators were advised to 
refrain from administering CYP3A4/5 inducers or inhibitors to patients prior to initiation and during treatment 
with midostaurin. 
Dose reductions 
Dose interruptions and dose reductions were to be applied for pre-specified haematological and non-
haematological toxicities. In case of haematological and non-haematological toxicity the dose of midostaurin 
was to be reduced to 50 mg b.i.d. after AEs had resolved. Dose reduction below 50 mg b.i.d. was not 
allowed, and treatment had to be discontinued in case patients could not tolerate 50 mg b.i.d. 
Objectives  
Primary objective:  
The primary objective was to determine the efficacy of midostaurin when administered orally at a dose of 100 
mg b.i.d. continuously for 6 cycles (of 4 weeks each) in patients with ASM or MCL with or without AHNMD as 
measured by overall response rate (ORR). The ORR was defined as the percentage of patients classified as

compartment of the disease at baseline, after 6 cycles of therapy, and at end of treatment (EOT) and 
explore potential associations with efficacy outcomes 
Biomarker analyses:  
•  Serum tryptase was measured during treatment in order to monitor the disease and potential 
treatment effects in SM 
•  Histopathology analyses, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and KIT mutational analyses were also 
performed

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint was ORR, defined as the percentage of patients with a confirmed response (MR or PR) 
as adjudicated by the SSC based on response criteria specified in the protocol (modified Valent/Cheson 
criteria) and with an initial response occurring in the first 6 cycles (Table 55). 
Table 53 Overview of response criteria 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/516229/2017 
Page 112/209 
 
  
  
 
Changes in C-findings reflecting the different response categories are shown in Table 56. 
Table 54 Definition of responses in measurable C-Findings 
Responses based on C-findings had to be confirmed at least 8 weeks (56 days) apart. Progression based on 
C-findings had to be confirmed at least 4 weeks (28 days) apart. Responses and progression based on 
transfusions alone (as assessed within a 56 day period) required confirmation in the subsequent period of 56 
days. 
Changes in C-findings or any other relevant parameters to assess response were compared to baseline. The 
responses were adjudicated by the SSC. Histopathologist comments pertaining to SM and AHNMD status from 
the review of BM biopsies/aspirations and associated markers (if performed) were captured in the CRF. In 
those patients presenting with an AHNMD, the evolution of the AHNMD-component of the disease was 
followed using the typical cytological and/or clonal markers for that disease. It was captured on the CRF by 
recording the observations in the comments section. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/516229/2017 
Page 113/209 
 
  
  
 
For patients presenting with the C-finding of anaemia and/or thrombocytopenia and who received RBC and/or 
platelet transfusions within a 56 day period prior to entry into the study (cycle 1, day 1), modified criteria 
applied for the assessment of response so as to account for interference by transfusions (as described in the 
CSR of study D2201).  
Major Response : An MR was characterised by complete resolution of at least one or more C -finding(s) and 
no confirmed progression in other C-findings. In patients with multiple C-findings, the C-finding that showed 
the best response was the determinant. 
Major response was further classified into: 
•  Complete remission (CR): disappearance of all mast cell infiltrates in affected organs, decrease of 
serum tryptase level to <20 ng/mL, and disappearance of SM-associated organomegaly. 
• 
• 
Incomplete remission (IR): decrease in mast cell infiltrates in affected organs and/or substantial 
decrease (>50%) of serum tryptase level from baseline and/or visible regression of organomegaly. 
Pure clinical response (PCR): no significant response in mast cell infiltrates, tryptase levels, or 
organomegaly that defines a CR or IR. 
•  Unspecified: No reliable information on bone marrow mast cell infiltration, serum tryptase level, or 
hepatomegaly/splenomegaly available to determine the sub-category of MR (this classification was 
not defined in the protocol). 
Partial Response 
A PR was a measurable improvement in one or more C-findings without confirmed progression in other C-
findings. In patients with multiple C-findings, the C-finding that showed the best response was the 
determinant. For the assessment of ORR only the measurable C-findings defined in Table 56 was considered. 
A PR was further classified into: Good partial response (GPR): >50% regression of one or more C-findings 
and no progression in other C-findings; Minor response (MinR): >20% to ≤50% regression of one or more C-
findings and no progression in other C-findings. 
No Response 
•  Stable disease (SD): C-findings that showed a constant range, not meeting the criteria for a response 
or progressive disease 
• 
Progressive disease (PD): one or more C-findings showing progression. 
Secondary endpoints 
Duration of response defined as the time from the start of the first confirmed response occurring before the 
end of Cycle 6 until the date of first confirmed PD or death due to ASM/SM-AHN/MCL.  
Overall survival defined as the time from the start of treatment to the date of death due to any cause.  
Time to response (TTR) defined as the time from the date of start of treatment to the date of onset of first 
confirmed response (MR or PR) and presented by summary statistics.  
Progression-free survival (PFS) defined as the time from the start of treatment to the date of the first 
confirmed progression or death due to any cause. If a patient did not progress or die at the time of the 
analysis cut-off, PFS was censored at the date of the last adequate response assessment. If a patient 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/516229/2017 
Page 114/209 
 
  
  
received any further anti-neoplastic therapy before the time of the analysis cut-off, PFS was censored at the 
date of the last adequate response assessment prior to the start of the anti-neoplastic therapy. 
Histopathologic response was summarised to demonstrate the best change from baseline in percentage of MC 
infiltrations in the BM. 
Organomegaly: A listing summarizing liver and spleen measurements by CT/Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging/Ultra sound scan with the corresponding percent change in unidimensional and volumetric 
measurement from baseline was produced.  
Patient-reported outcomes: The Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) (Portenoy et al., 1994) and 
the Short Form health survey (SF-12) questionnaires were used to assess patient reported outcomes (PROs).  
Sample size 
Based on the ASM literature from previous studies using treatments other than midostaurin, and based on 
preliminary results from the ongoing investigator-initiated study PKC412A2213 in which 11 out of 15 patients 
with ASM obtained an MR using Valent Criteria (Valent et al 2003), the proportion of responders under the 
null hypothesis was set to 0.30 and under the alternative, 0.50.The original protocol had the sample size was 
an adaption of the Fleming two-stage design with 40 patients in stage 1 and 20 in stage 2 to test H0: 
response rate ≤ 030 vs Ha: response rate ≥0.50. The testing procedure was : if 14 of fewer responses in 
stage 1 then reject H1; if 20 or more responses in stage 1 then reject H0; if between 15 up to and including 
19 responses then proceed to stage 2; if 27 or more responses out of 60 after stage 2 then reject H0, 
otherwise reject Ha. With this testing procedure the type I error of stage 1 was 0.015 and the type I error for 
stage 2 (i.e. the probability under H0 to enter stage 2 and then reject H0) was 0.005, so total type I error 
0.020. The power to reject H0 (given the response rate was ≥0.50) was 0.682 in stage 1 and 0.157 in stage 
2 (i.e. the probability to enter stage 2 and then reject H0). 
Randomisation 
This was a non-randomised, open-label, study.  
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
Binary endpoints (e.g. ORR) had their 95%-CI estimated with the exact binomial method. The Kaplan-Meier 
method was used to analyse time to event endpoints, with 95%-CI at specific time points estimated using 
Greenwood’s formula, and 95%-CI of the median with the Brookmeyer-Crowley method.  
Sensitivity analyses to the primary analysis of ORR (on PEP, per SCC) included analysis on FAS (non-eligible 
patients as per SCC designated non-evaluable / subtype non-responders), idem on PPS, analysis based on 
response based on investigator and calculated by Novartis, analysis including late responders (after cycle 6), 
analysis excluding C-finding of anaemia/thrombocytopenia in presence of RBC/platelet-transfusions. 
PFS and DOR were censored for >1 missed visits, start new anti-cancer therapy, and deaths due to reason 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/516229/2017 
Page 115/209 
 
  
  
other than deterioration of ‘study indication’. Sensitivity analyses included events after >1 missed visits.  
The chosen Fleming two-stage design (testing procedure: see sample size) implied an interim analysis at 
which 0.015 was spent. The total type I error (so including the possibility to enter stage 2) was originally 
0.020. 
The ORR in PEP was summarized for stage 1 patients, extension phase patients and for stage 1 and extension 
phase patients together. The primary efficacy analysis of ORR controlling the type I error was the analysis 
performed on the 40 stage I patients. 
A post-hoc analysis of Study D2201 data was conducted using the new (more stringent) response criteria 
published in 2013 by the International Working Group-Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment 
(IWG-MRT) & European Competence Network on Mastocytosis (ECNM; referred to as IWG criteria. The IWG 
response criteria are more stringent, primarily because of inclusion of minimum duration of improvement of 
12 weeks, and a minimum range of improvement for most C-findings. The analysis of response per IWG is 
purely algorithm based, whereas in the primary efficacy analysis performed by the Applicant both eligibility 
and responses based on the modified Valent criteria were adjudicated by the SSC. Patients whose only C-
finding at baseline was ascites (n=2) were removed from the analysis according to IWG criteria because 
history of ascites symptoms could not be adequately assessed in this post-hoc analysis. For the same reason, 
for patients who had a C-finding of ascites in addition to other C-findings, ascites was not counted as a C-
finding.  
Full Analysis Set (FAS) 
The FAS was defined according to the Intention to Treat (ITT) principle and comprises all patients to whom 
study treatment has been assigned. For this was single arm trial, study treatment was determined to be 
assigned if the patient received at least one dose of the study drug in the “Drug Administration Record” CRF. 
Demographics, medical history, and baseline disease characteristics were summarised using the FAS. 
Sensitivity analyses of efficacy endpoints were done using the FAS. 
Primary Efficacy Population (PEP) 
The PEP consisted of patients in the FAS meeting the diagnostic criteria for ASM or MCL, and presenting with 
at least one measurable C-Finding at study entry and/or patients with transfusion dependent (TD) anaemia 
due to their underlying disease at study entry as confirmed by the SSC in the “Eligibility adjudication” CRF 
form. All efficacy end-points were summarised using the PEP. Patients with haemoglobin or platelet as the 
only C-Finding required another C-Finding in the presence of transfusions. 
Per-Protocol Set (PPS) 
The per-protocol Set consisted of all patients from the PEP who did not have any major protocol deviations 
(related to inclusion, exclusion criteria and study conduct) which could affect the evaluation of the primary 
endpoint. The primary efficacy endpoint of ORR was summarised using the Per-protocol Set. 
Pharmacokinetic Set (PK Set) 
The PK set consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of midostaurin and had at least one 
evaluable post-baseline midostaurin concentration measurement.

The Safety Set included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. The safety set was used for 
all safety analyses.

Recruitment 
Study initiation date: 6 January 2009 (first patient first visit).  
Study completion date: 14 June 2012 (last patient first visit).  
Study D2201 enrolled 116 patients across 29 centres in 12 countries. Study centres: Australia (2), Austria 
(1), Belgium (1), Canada (2), France (2), Germany (5), Netherlands (1), Norway (1), Poland (1), Turkey (1), 
United Kingdom (3), United States (9).  
Conduct of the study  
There were a total of six protocol amendments: 
Amendment 1 (25-Nov-2008) was issued to include changes to the inclusion and exclusion criteria and, to 
the schedule of examinations to optimize the capturing of disease evolution, and the sampling scheme to 
alleviate the burden on patients (BM, imaging, PK sampling etc.), and to the overall language for further 
refinement and better clarity. 
Amendment 2 (23-Nov-2010) was issued to ensure that only patients with measurable C -findings due to 
mastocytosis were enrolled into the study. Among the Stage I patients enrolled in the study 36% were 
considered by the SSC to be ineligible for response assessment. 
To address these issues, systematic collection of the following information was added: history of weight and 
blood product transfusions, ongoing transfusions, mediator-related symptoms, and antineoplastic therapies 
since discontinuation of study drug. Changes were made to the response criteria for patients receiving blood 
transfusions prior to or during study treatment. A patient enrolment approval process by the SSC chair was 
implemented. Histopathologic response was added as a secondary objective. The definition of the PEP and 
additional sub-analyses to observe the impact of these were added. In addition, an extension phase was 
implemented to provide more information on safety and efficacy of midostaurin. 
Amendment 3 (6-Dec-2010) was issued to address the request from the Canadian Health Authorities to add 
an exclusion criterion of “Patients with heart block of any degree at screening”. The protocol was amended 
for Canada only. 
Amendment 4 (8-Feb-2012) was issued to clarify the follow-up for patients who discontinued study treatment 
in the absence of disease progression (e.g., due to AE). These patients were to be followed for disease status 
until the time of disease progression, initiation of another antineoplastic therapy, or end of study, whichever 
was first. Also, the definition of disease progression was updated to comprise a laboratory abnormality not 
existing at baseline that occurred during study treatment and was attributed to SM. If this new C–Finding 
demonstrated a worsening >20% from the value at baseline and was maintained for at least 28 days, this 
circumstance was defined as disease progression. 
Amendment 5 (20-Aug-2012) was issued to include language that allowed patients to continue to receive 
midostaurin in accordance with local regulations. 
Amendment 6 (27-May-2014) was issued to revise the definition of the end of study to allow for an extended 
collection period of efficacy and safety data. The end of study definition was revised to occur five years after 
last patient first treatment, or when all patients had discontinued study treatment, whichever occurred first. 
This extended period of data collection will be reviewed through supplemental annual central adjudication 
meetings by the SSC. Moreover, patients who continue to benefit from treatment with midostaurin will 
continue to have access to study treatment. In addition, retrospective collection of the date of diagnosis of 
Assessment report

SM/ASM/MCL was added to allow comparative assessment of OS data from this study with that from 
historical data.

Sensitivity analyses of Overall Response Rate 
Different sensitivity analyses were conducted: 
•  Best overall response (BOR) for the FAS. For these analyses, all patients who were considered to be 
ineligible for the PEP were assessed as being “non-evaluable” and were classified as subtype “non-
responders”.

In the FAS, the ORR was 45.7% (95%CI: 36.4-55.2; p<0.001) 
In the PPS (n=86), the ORR was 58.1% (95%CI: 47.0-68.7) 
•  By Valent/Cheson criteria, without ancillary information: based on isolated responses of C-findings 
without consideration of the clinical context, the ORR in the PEP was 46.1% (95%CI: 35.4-57.0), 
with 38 patients having an MR, and 3 patients a PR.  
•  By investigator assessment: The ORR in the PEP in the first 6 cycles of treatment according to the 
Investigator assessment was 52.8% (95%CI: 41.9, 63.5), with 33 patients having an MR and 14 
patients having a PR.

Secondary endpoint-Spleen volume 
A decrease in spleen volume was seen on at least one occasion for the majority of patients who had 
volumetric spleen size data available at baseline and post-baseline (34/45 patients, 75.6%). Furthermore, 
26.7% of these patients had a best decrease in spleen volume of at least 35% (previously been considered a 
threshold for clinical improvement in splenomegaly among patients with myeloproliferative disorders; 
Harrison et al. 2012, NEJM).

Comparison of OS data from studies D2201 and A2213 with those from a registry of patients with ASM 
Exploratory analyses were performed to further assess the clinical benefit of midostaurin in the studied 
population by comparing the OS observed with midostaurin to the OS observed in an independent German 
Registry (Heidelberg University), including patients with ASM or MCL +/- AHNMD who never received 
midostaurin. However it is considered that these analyses are methodologically unsound, and severely biased 
in favour of the midostaurin group (data not shown).

Supportive studies 
Acute myeloid leukaemia indication 
Study ADE02T  
An interim analysis was conducted on the first cohort of 145 patients enrolled into study ADE02T, which was 
a phase 2, single-arm, multicentre, investigator-initiated study evaluating the efficacy and safety of 
midostaurin in combination with intensive induction therapy (daunorubicin and cytarabine) and as single 
agent maintenance therapy after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) or high-dose 
cytarabine in patients with newly diagnosed FLT3-ITD positive AML. Patients aged 18-70 years old are 
enrolled in this study. 
In study ADE02T, after achieving CR patients proceed to ASCT as the preferred treatment option, and if ASCT 
was not feasible then patients received four cycles of age-adapted high-dose cytarabine (day 1, 3, and 5) in 
combination with midostaurin (day 6 onwards). All patients were to receive 1 year of midostaurin 
maintenance therapy post-SCT or cytarabine consolidation. The primary endpoint was EFS. Secondary 
endpoints included CR rate, relapse free survival (RFS), OS, and the cumulative incidences of relapse (CIR) 
and death (CID) in CR. 
ADE02T differed in some critical aspects of study design from the pivotal study (A2301). In the pivotal study 
patients receiving SCT discontinued midostaurin, while in study ADE02T patients received 1 year 
maintenance treatment with midostaurin after SCT. In the pivotal study patients received midostaurin on 
days 8-21, while in study ADE02T patients received midostaurin from day 8 until 48 hours prior to start of 
the next cycle of chemotherapy or conditioning therapy for SCT (effectively this means patients were 
intended to receive midostaurin on days 8-26 in contrast to days 8-21 as in the pivotal study). In study 
ADE02T patients older than 60 years of age were enrolled. 
In study ADE02T, patients had a median age of 53.6 years (range: 20 to 69 years; 32% of patients were 
>60 years of age), and the age groups (≤ 60, >60) were well matched with respect to gender and ECOG 
status. The median follow-up was derived taking the Kaplan-Meier estimate of median time to censoring and 
was 25.2 months (95%CI: 24.4-27.4). The primary efficacy endpoint was EFS after 2 years. The 2 year EFS 
of the whole cohort was 34.6% (95%CI: 27.4-43.6), which was higher than historical cohort of 588 FLT3-ITD 
AML patients used for comparison (2 year EFS 25%). Improved 2 year EFS rates were notable for patients 
>60 years with 27.1% (95%CI: 16.6-44.1) compared to 14% in the historical control. The median EFS was 
10.7 months (95%CI: 7.7-19.7) for the whole population; 13.8 months (95%CI: 7.9, 23.3) in younger 
patients and 9.3 months (95%CI: 3.5-21.1) in older patients. 
The CR rates (CR/CRi) were 77% (age ≤ 60 years) and 67% (age>60 years); 50% of the younger patients 
and 23% of those >60 years proceeded to SCT in CR1. Relapse free survival after 2 years was 51.3% and 
36.6% for the younger and older age groups respectively. The median OS after 2 years was 24.7 months; 
28.5 months for patients ≤ 60 years, and 15.5 months for those >60 years. 
Additional comparison analysis of study ADE02T with historical controls 
The Applicant has provided data on a comparison between efficacy of midostaurin in patients >60 years of 
age from ADE02T with efficacy in historical controls. The historical controls were selected from 5 successive 
clinical trials conducted by AMLSG enrolling AML patients treated with intensive chemotherapy (Tassara et al 
2014, Schlenk et al 2016b, Schlenk et al 2006a, Schlenk et al 2006b, Schlenk et al 2004a, Schlenk 2004b, 
Schlenk 2003). Only limited information was provided on baseline characteristics. Propensity score matching

was applied for the following baseline variables: age, gender, NPM1 mutation status, white blood cell count 
and percentage of bone marrow blasts, in an effort to control for prognostic variables. In the analysis no 
correction for time/year of initiation of treatment (while prognostic for outcome) was performed. Based on 
this analysis the HR (95%CI) for OS was 0.49 (0.316, 0.753) for patients >60 years of age (data not shown). 
Aggressive systemic mastocytosis / Mast cell leukaemia indication 
Study A2213 (PKC412A2213) 
This was a single-arm, Phase II, open-label study using Simon’s two-stage design to assess the efficacy of 
oral midostaurin at a dose of 100 mg b.i.d. in patients with ASM or MCL with or without associated 
haematological clonal non-mast cell lineage disease (AHNMD). Midostaurin was administered in cycles of 28 
days duration.  
Initially, 10 patients were to be enrolled in Stage I, and each patient was to be evaluated for at least 2 
months for efficacy, safety, tolerability, PK and pharmacodynamic endpoints. Any patient who discontinued 
treatment for reasons other than toxicity, death or disease progression was to be replaced. If at least one of 
the first 10 patients from the Stage I had a response, an additional 15 patients were to be enrolled into the 
Stage II of the study. If none of the first 10 patients had a clinical response, the study was to be closed. The 
Stage I and Stage II portions of the Simon’s two-stage design was conducted under the leadership of the 
Principal Investigator and Novartis received the data (data up to 3 December 2012) after all patients were 
enrolled in Stage I and Stage II portions of the study. 
Patients were followed for survival for one year after they stopped treatment. 
Midostaurin was administered at a dose of 100 mg b.i.d., beginning on Day 1. Each patient could receive up 
to 12 cycles of midostaurin; each cycle was 28 days in duration. At the end of each cycle the patient was 
evaluated for response. After the first 2 cycles of therapy, patients without a documented MR or PR according 
to the Valent criteria (Valent et al. 2003) were to be discontinued from the study. This is different from the 
main study where patients received treatment until documented progression or discontinuation for other 
reasons such as unacceptable toxicity. 
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of twice-daily oral doses of PKC412 (midostaurin) when 
administered to patients with ASM/MCL ± AHNMD (associated haematological clonal non-mast cell lineage 
disease) by measuring ORR. 
Secondary objectives included PKs of twice-daily oral doses of PKC412, evaluation of the effect of PKC412 on 
survival, investigation of ASM/MCL specific DNA mutations and comparison of gene expression changes in 
blood and bone marrow cells, and investigation of the effects of genetic variation in drug metabolism genes. 
The first 2 secondary objectives presented above were evaluated in this study. Secondary objectives 3 and 4 
were not evaluated in this study, because the format of data collection did not allow for the generation of 
summary statistics. 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria were highly similar to the main study (study A2213).  
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was ORR based on investigator assessment, over the first 2 
cycles. The response assessments in patients with ASM and MCL were based on the response criteria of 
Valent et al. (2003).

Results 
A total of 26 patients were enrolled from 7 July 2005 to 26 April 2010 at 3 centres in the United States. At 
the time of the data cut-off date (3 December 2012), 7 patients were continuing to receive study drug, and 
19 patients had discontinued study drug. Among the 26 patients enrolled in the study, all patients were 
included in all analysis sets.  
The median duration of study follow-up was 73 months (range: 31 – 89 months). Twenty (76.9%) patients 
had ASM (17 [85%] with AHNMD) and 6 patients (23.1%) had MCL (2 [33.3%] with AHNMD). The median 
age was 64.5 years with half of the patients ≥ 65 years). At baseline, 88.5% had >1 C finding and 69.2% 
had received at least one prior anti neoplastic regimen (SmPC, section 5.1).

Median overall survival was 40.0 months (patients were only followed up for one year after treatment

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
AML indication 
In phase I and II studies, the OS and EFS were similar between 50 mg bid and 100 mg bid dosage regimens 
and together with the acceptable safety profiles, the dose of 50 mg in AML patients was considered 
acceptable. 
The overall design of the study was considered adequate. The target patient population (patients with ≥ 5% 
FLT3-mutated alleles), the comparator (standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy plus placebo), 
and the sequential dosing regimen of midostaurin were considered acceptable and have been previously 
agreed upon in an SAWP scientific advice (EMEA/H/SA/764/1/2006/PA/III). The inclusion and exclusion 
criteria were considered adequate and the enrolled patient population was considered to be a clinically

representative population of patients with FLT3 positive AML. The patient population in the pivotal study was 
restricted to patients younger than 60 years of age. This reflects the standard of care at the time that the 
pivotal study was initiated, i.e., at that stage patients older than 60 years of age were deemed ineligible for 
standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy. As current practice is that AML patients older than 60 
who are fit should also treated with standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy, an indication is 
proposed by the applicant without restriction of age (see efficacy data and additional analyses below).   
A relatively high number of major protocol violations occurred in the pivotal study. The nature of the protocol 
deviations and the distribution across treatment arms is such that they do not impact the conclusions 
regarding efficacy and safety drawn from the submitted data to a relevant extent.  The main amendments to 
the study protocol did not impact the interpretation of the efficacy or safety results.  
Three GCP inspections were performed at three centres participating in the pivotal study. The three sites 
were assessed as compliant, despite a few critical findings that were noted. Considering the nature of these 
critical findings (they were mainly related to the informed consent process and drug accountability) however, 
it is concluded that they do not impact the reliability of the submitted efficacy and safety data. 
Signs of monotherapy activity of midostaurin have been observed in patients with FLT3 mutated as well as 
wild type AML in early clinical studies, although the activity might be higher in patients with mutated FLT3. 
These findings are supported by data from ex vivo studies indicating higher activity in cell lines with FLT3 
mutation. At this stage, therefore, there is an acceptable rationale for the proposed target population of 
FLT3-mutated patients (although the favourable findings observed in patients with mutated FLT3 might 
support further studies to be conducted in FLT3 wild type AML). The cut-off for FLT3 status is considered 
acceptable and was agreed upon in a previous scientific advice (EMEA/H/SA/764/1/2006/PA/III). Quality 
control regarding FLT3 screening during conduct of the pivotal study was adequate.  The CHMP agreed that in 
view of the availability of a FLT3 mutation test at multiple commercial and academic centres, co-development 
of a commercially available Health Authority-approved FLT3 mutation detection kit would not be considered 
necessary.  
Regarding the choice for the induction and consolidation chemotherapy regimens, in clinical practice, different 
varieties of regimens are used, using slightly different doses and/or e.g. different types of anthracyclines. It 
is unclear to which extent different induction and consolidation regimens could interact differently with 
midostaurin from a PK/PD perspective and in regard to the treatment effect of midostaurin. Therefore, the 
chemotherapy to be used in combination with Rydapt is specified in the wording of the indication.  
The chosen primary endpoint, OS, was considered adequate to demonstrate clinical benefit in the context of 
first-line treatment of AML. In the primary analysis patients receiving SCT were not censored. This is 
considered appropriate. The secondary endpoints, EFS (with and without censoring for SCT), DFS, CR rate, 
and SCT rate are considered adequate endpoints which are relevant in the context of the studied population. 
Patient and disease characteristics were balanced between treatment arms, with the exception of a small 
imbalance in gender (females accounted for 51.7% vs. 59.4% of patients in the midostaurin and placebo 
arms, respectively). Subjects with a history of cardiac problems, including symptomatic congestive heart 
failure, were excluded from the pivotal study. Taking into account the proposed target population, exclusion 
of risk groups such as these from the pivotal study is described in the SmPC.  
The pivotal study in AML did not include MRD assessment, because, at the time this study was initiated 
(2008) there was no universal, robust, regulatory authority-approved technology available to measure MRD. 
However the results of study E2301, a randomised, double-blind study of midostaurin versus placebo in 
combination with chemotherapy during induction and consolidation, followed by 12 months of midostaurin 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/516229/2017 
Page 148/209 
 
  
  
monotherapy in adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with newly diagnosed AML, without FLT3 mutation, will 
provide information on MRD assessment (see Annex II conditions).  
ASM/SM-AHN/MCL indication 
No dose-finding studies were conducted in ASM/SM-AHN/MCL. The dose of 100 mg b.i.d was selected based 
on the same phase I and II studies in AML patients (i.e. A2104 and A2104E1). Since there were no data in 
ASM/SM-AHN/MCL patients after 50 mg b.i.d, and the safety profile with 100 mg b.i.d was acceptable in 
ASM/SM-AHN/MCL patients the dose of 100 mg b.i.d was considered acceptable. 
Issues related to the conduct of the main study such as a large proportion of ineligible patients were enrolled 
in the study, an amendment affecting the statistical analysis plan and the primary analysis introduced 
halfway during the study and also concerns regarding potential bias in the assessment of the primary 
endpoint ORR by the SSC were further discussed. There were issues related to the accuracy of the ORR as 
primary endpoint including the use of Valent and Cheson criteria, the heterogeneity observed in the degree of 
responses, the assessment of the responses,  the primary efficacy on a subset of population and the 
discordance in the analysis of best overall response (by the investigator vs by the SSC). These concerns were 
relieved based on a post-hoc analysis provided by the applicant, in which ORR was determined using the 
most recent response criteria (IWG-MRT & ECNM criteria), and in which an algorithm-based assessment is 
performed without the potentially subjective nature of assessment by the SSC. 
The lack of a comparative design  as the pivotal results obtained in a single arm trial (D2201), was of 
concern. Adequate justification for why a randomized clinical trial is not feasible in the ASM, SM-AHN, and 
MCL indication was provided. Considering that these are rare life-threatening conditions with large unmet 
medical need, the lack of a randomized controlled trial was considered acceptable. Study D2201 is the largest 
prospectively conducted clinical trial in this population. Recruitment was completed in three years (January 
2009 to June 2012) and the study is still ongoing. A controlled trial with a relevant size to perform 
appropriate statistical comparison would take a very long time to complete. 
Duration of response (DOR) and the remaining secondary endpoints, including OS, MC improvement, and 
spleen volume were considered relevant endpoints. Quality of life data are highly relevant, but interpretation 
of the quality of life measurements that were performed in the main study was problematic in view of the 
single-arm, open-label design of the study.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
AML indication 
The primary endpoint OS (without censoring for SCT) was met, with a HR of 0.774 (95% CI: 0.629-0.953, 
p=0.0078), corresponding to a relative risk reduction of 23% in favour of midostaurin. The midostaurin arm 
had a higher plateau, with 51% (95%CI: 45-56) of the patients surviving at the 5-year time point, versus 
43% (95%CI: 38-49) of the patients in the placebo arm. Comparison of the median OS values (midostaurin: 
75 months; placebo: 26 months) is not informative since the Kaplan-Meier curves plateau around the median 
and estimates of the median are therefore not precise.  The difference in OS, and the higher plateau for 
patients treated with midostaurin, are considered to be of clinical relevance for the target population, 
although the treatment effect as determined by the HR was considered to be of moderate magnitude. 
Censoring for SCT did not affect the results regarding OS, confirming the robustness of the OS benefit 
conferred by midostaurin in the overall population. Multivariable analysis also confirmed the OS benefit in the 
overall population. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/516229/2017 
Page 149/209 
 
  
  
Most subgroups showed a similar OS benefit as in the overall population. However, while males had a clear 
OS benefit in the pivotal study (HR 0.53, 95%CI: 0.39-0.72), females appeared to have no OS benefit from 
treatment with midostaurin relative to placebo (HR 1.01, 95%CI: 0.76-1.34). Review of the publicly available 
literature for potential gender differences in outcome in newly diagnosed/untreated AML adult patients 
receiving intensive chemotherapy, indicated that in most studies no significant differences between males 
and females are observed. No apparent gender effect in OS was seen in supportive study A2106 in FLT3+ 
AML patients, while a trend towards longer OS for males was noted in supportive study ADE02T. However, 
while a gender difference has not consistently been observed, study A2301 is not the first study in the 
published literature reporting a (potential) difference in gender. This somewhat alleviates the concern 
regarding the lack of internal consistency.  
A gender difference in OS was evident in the placebo arm and was statistically significant (HR=0.66; 95% CI 
0.49, 0.90 in a multivariate analysis). Additional analyses of SCT by gender and treatment arms showed that 
censoring for SCT diminished the effect of gender on OS (HR 0.812, 95% CI 0.520, 1.269) in the placebo 
arm, while the SCT rates and timing of SCT did not reveal major differences between these groups. This was 
due to better survival of males (shift in the KM curve) when censoring for SCT while censoring had only 
limited effect on the survival curve for females. This apparent gender-related difference was confirmed in the 
OS analysis of the subgroups who received SCT. Additional censoring analysis (for SCT in CR1 only or SCT in 
salvage) seemed to indicate that this is mainly caused by a gender difference between patients receiving SCT 
as salvage therapy. While, in the midostaurin arm, the impact of SCT censoring on the survival curves also 
seems to be larger for males than females, this effect seems less than what is noted in the placebo arm. 
Notably, due to this differential effect of SCT on the male and female survival curve, a separation of these 
curves seems to be occurring but this did not result in a statistical significant difference in OS (HR 1.192, 
95% CI 0.745, 1.908) in the midostaurin arm. Although all these censoring and subgroup analyses should be 
interpreted with caution as they are post-hoc, and may be subject to informative censoring or are based on a 
post-baseline parameter and therefore bias cannot be excluded they do suggest that the observed difference 
in OS benefit between the sexes may, at least in part, be SCT-related and thus to a post-midostaurin 
treatment event. The data also indicated that midostaurin treatment may have played a role in the impact of 
SCT on the survival of males and females in this study, as the impact differs between the treatments arms 
(thus there might be a potential carry-over effect). As it is likely that SCT has substantially contributed to the 
apparent gender effect, it is important to note that censoring for SCT (sensitivity analysis) in the ITT 
population (HR 0.75, 95%CI: 0.54-1.03) confirmed the observed OS benefit conferred by midostaurin 
observed in the primary analysis (HR 0.774 (95% CI: 0.629, 0.953). Based on this observation, together 
with the fact that for females a benefit of treatment was seen in the secondary endpoints EFS, CR and CIR, it 
is considered that there is sufficient evidence of benefit, and no safety signal, to collectively outweigh the 
uncertainty on the effect size and concern regarding the internal consistently, provided that the observed 
effects between the sexes are adequately described in the SmPC. Confirmation or refutation of this gender 
difference is expected from the planned ongoing study in newly diagnosed FLT3 wild type AML patients 
(E2301), and as this study includes a more substantial biomarker analysis, also a more mechanistical 
explanation might be found.  
In current clinical practice, three genetic alterations are routinely determined as prognostic markers in AML, 
i.e. FLT3, NPM1, and CEBPA. Like FLT3, alterations in NPM1 and CEBPA affect outcome of patients with AML, 
and in the 2016 revision to the WHO classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukaemia, “AML with 
mutated NPM1” and “AML with biallelic mutations of CEBPA” have become separate clinical entities. In 
additional analysis, NPM1 status did not affect the treatment effect of midostaurin, as midostaurin was

Page 150/209 
 
  
  
effective both in NPM1 mutated and NPM1 wildtype FLT3-mutated AML. CEBPA alterations were too 
infrequent (2.5%) in FLT3-mutated AML patients for analyses to be performed.  
The effect of midostaurin on EFS was concordant with the effect on OS, with a HR of 0.784 favouring 
midostaurin (p=0.0024). Similar to OS, a higher plateau for EFS was observed for the midostaurin treatment 
arm. The effect of midostaurin on EFS was homogeneous across the investigated subgroups, including 
males/females and multivariable analysis confirmed the EFS benefit in the overall population. The EFS benefit 
is supportive of the overall result on OS. 
The CR rate was higher in the midostaurin arm in the analysis that considered all CRs (including those that 
occurred outside of the 60-day window) further confirming the anti-AML activity of midostaurin. Also the 
results regarding DFS were in line with the primary endpoint: HR 0.71, 95%CI: 0.55-0.92 (one-sided 
p=0.0051), confirming the efficacy of midostaurin. 
Slightly more patients in the midostaurin arm (59.4%) received SCT throughout the study as compared to 
the placebo arm (55.2%) possibly indicating that more patients receiving midostaurin became eligible/fit for 
SCT. In addition, more patients achieved CR in the midostaurin arm vs. the placebo arm. The proportion of 
patients who died after SCT in their first CR was lower in the midostaurin arm (HR 0.638) than in the placebo 
arm, but the 95%CI was relatively wide (0.373-1.091). Thus, so far the data indicated that midostaurin prior 
to SCT does not impair the results of SCT. The comparison of survival data in the subgroup of all patients 
who received SCT was performed and confirmed the efficacy of midostaurin in this subgroup. 
The added value of maintenance treatment is difficult to establish based on the design of the pivotal study. 
While two deaths (total events nine) were reported in the placebo arm in this phase, no deaths of 16 events 
were reported the midostaurin arm, which is reassuring. Interpretation of the exploratory analyses is difficult 
due to the following reasons: lack of re-randomisation of the midostaurin patients to either placebo or 
midostaurin at the start of continuation therapy, the fact that the efficacy analyses performed to support the 
effect of midostaurin given as continuation therapy was based on a small sample size (less than 30% of the 
randomised patients) and the highly selected population included in the analysis. Therefore, at present the 
available data did not allow a firm conclusion regarding the added value of the 12 months midostaurin 
continuation therapy. However, there is a clear scientific rationale for following the induction and 
consolidation phases by a period of maintenance therapy in FLT3-mutated AML, which has a high relapse rate 
that can be partly attributed to FLT3 clones (although other clones also contribute to relapse). Furthermore, 
the efficacy of midostaurin has been demonstrated only when a continuation/maintenance phase is applied. 
In addition, the safety profile of midostaurin monotherapy is favourable. For these reasons, the proposed 
indication which includes a postremission maintenance phase is considered acceptable. 
In the pivotal study, only  patients <60 years of age were enrolled.  During the initial evaluation, the CHMP 
raised a major objection about the indication needing to be further discussed, with reference to patients ≥ 60 
years of age.  Several post-hoc analyses were conducted to evaluate effect of age on efficacy outcome (CR, 
EFS, DFS and OS) in study A2301. CR, EFS, DFS and OS were also reviewed by 5-year intervals. These post-
hoc analyses do not support a hypothesis where efficacy of midostaurin would decrease with increasing age, 
and no conclusions can be drawn regarding specific age cutoffs for treatment. The biology of AML may differ 
between  young  and  old  AML  patients,  but  not  in  the  subset  of  patients  with  FLT3  mutations  eligible  to 
intensive  chemotherapy.  The  main  change  of  biology  of  AML  related  to  age  is  an  increase  in  complex 
cytogenetics in older patients, which is not relevant to patients with a FLT mutation. Therefore there are no 
reasons to expect that the mode of action differs between older and younger FLT3-positive AML patients and 
the age is not expected to affect the PK of midostaurin. In addition, the safety profile of midostaurin appears 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/516229/2017 
Page 151/209 
 
  
  
similar in patients >60 vs those <60 years of age based on the analysis in the ADE02T study. Regarding the 
comparison with historical controls it is considered that interpretation of the data is strongly hampered as a 
result of different factors i.e. the time of treatment and the frequency of SCT. 
In conclusion, in spite of the limited experience in patients ≥ 60 years of age, the preliminary findings of the 
supportive  study  ADE02T  indicated  a  beneficial  effect  also  in  this  population.  Furthermore,  the  results  from 
the  post-hoc  analyses  (study  A2301)  did  not  demonstrate  that  the  efficacy  of  midostaurin  would  decrease 
with increasing age, which is reassuring. Therefore the CHMP agreed that the observed survival benefit in the 
population of the pivotal study (<60 years of age) can be extrapolated to the ≥ 60 years of age population. 
However,  until  further  data  become  available  the  limited  experience  in  the  elderly  should  be  taken  into 
account  in  clinical  decision-making,  therefore  the  limited  experience  in  elderly  and  additional  guidance  on 
selecting  eligible  patients  has  been  included  in  the  product  information  (sections  4.2  and  5.1).  To  further 
resolve this, the applicant will submit the updated results of study ADE02T and the results of studies A2408 
and  E2301  when  available  in  order to  confirm  the  benefit  of  midostaurin  in  patients ≥ 60  years  of  age (see 
Annex II conditions).  
The  molecular  genetic  alterations  that  were  determined  as  part  of  clinical  practice  (NPM1  and  to  a  limited 
extent  CEBPA)  did  not  appear  to  affect  the  treatment  effect  of  midostaurin  (e.g.,  OS,  EFS).  In  addition,  no 
obvious  relation  between  the  genetic  markers  and  the  subgroup  of  gender  was  found.  Additional  efforts  to 
identify biomarkers that could be relevant in relation to the treatment effect of midostaurin based on samples 
that were banked as part of local protocols are under discussion between the Applicant and the cooperative 
groups.  A  Biomarker  study  (targeted  gene  panel  sequencing)  of  pre-treatment  samples  from  patients  in 
Study  A2301  will  evaluate  the  prognostic  and  predictive  value  of  specific  gene  mutations,  patterns  of  gene 
mutations,  and  key  pre-treatment  variables,  for  response  to  treatment  with  midostaurin  and  the  CHMP 
recommended the applicant to submit the results upon completion of the study.  
ASM/SM-AHN/MCL indication  
The initial indication proposed by the applicant included the use of midostaurin as monotherapy for the 
treatment of adult patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis. However, the CHMP considered that the 
wording of the indication should be amended in order to clearly and specifically reflect the enrolled patient 
population in line with the WHO classification. Based on this, the indication was revised to include aggressive 
systemic mastocytosis (ASM), systemic mastocytosis with associated haematological neoplasm (SM AHN) or 
mast cell leukaemia (MCL). 
The ORR was 59.6% (95%CI: 48.6-69.8, p<0.001) in the PEP, a subset of the overall population (N=89 out 
of 116). In the analysis conducted using the new, more stringent response criteria for ASM published in 2013 
by the IWG-MRT/ECNM (IWG criteria) the ORR was lower using (28%). An ORR analysis according to IWG 
criteria was performed for ASM, SM-AHN, and MCL patients separately following CHMP’s request. The overall 
ORR was 28.3% (with 32/113 patients having a response of CR, PR, or CI), and 60.0%, 20.8% and 33.3%, 
respectively, in patients with ASM, SM-AHNMD and MCL. Overall, it was considered that the observed 
responses are unlikely to be ‘spontaneous’, or related to the natural course of disease of mastocytosis, since 
prolonged improvement of C-findings (>12 weeks as required according to the IWG response criteria used) 
and durable reductions of mast cell burden (and serum tryptase) are not expected based on the natural 
course of the disease. Therefore, the observed responses were considered to be a treatment effect of 
midostaurin.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/516229/2017 
Page 152/209 
 
  
  
 
Clinically relevant durations of response were observed in patients who achieved response according to IWG 
criteria. This analysis showed that responses to midostaurin treatment were most durable among patients 
who achieved a CR or PR (median not reached, 95% CI: 27.0 – NE), and less durable in patients with clinical 
improvement alone. Thus, the magnitude of response was correlated with duration of response.  
In total 26.7% of these patients had a best decrease in spleen volume of at least 35%. Further data on 
changes in spleen volume during the course of treatment and spider plots of changes in bone marrow mast 
cell burden for all individual patients provided better insight into the course of changes in pharmacodynamic 
parameters over the course of treatment with midostaurin.  Durable improvements in mast cell burden are 
expected to be of benefit to the patient as reduced mast cell burden leads to reduction of the symptoms 
related to aberrant mast cell activity.  
Patient-reported outcomes were measured as an exploratory endpoint. Updated analyses showed that 
response according to Valent criteria was associated with superior PROs and provided additional insight into 
the clinical relevance of the PRO data. The analyses remain, however, considered exploratory, in view of the 
single-arm open-label nature of the study and of limited value in guiding treatment decisions. 
An ORR of 23.1% (3/13) was observed in KIT-wild type patients vs. 30.5% (29/95) in KIT-mutated patients. 
Among the three KIT-wild type patients who responded, all patients had substantial reductions in mast cell 
burden, in addition to improvement of their C-findings. Thus, despite the fact that KIT-wild type receptor is 
not expected to be inhibited to a relevant extent based on in vitro IC50 values (in contrast to KIT-D816V- 
mutated receptor), these response data are a strong suggestion that both patients with or without detectable 
levels of the KIT-D816V mutation may benefit from midostaurin therapy. The large difference in OS between 
KIT-mutated and KIT-wild type patients, with KIT-mutated patients having much longer OS, remains 
however unexplained, and a potential impact of KIT status on therapeutic efficacy of midostaurin cannot be 
excluded. It is therefore considered relevant to describe the OS data according to KIT status in the product 
information of Rydapt to adequately inform clinicians about the potential impact of KIT status (SmpC section 
5.1). 
No comparative data were available for the ASM/SM-AHN/MCL indication. However, the specific 
circumstances such as the extreme rarity of the diseases and the great unmet medical need in systemic 
mastocytosis patients should be considered. Furthermore, it is considered that the provided efficacy data for 
midostaurin are compelling relative to what is historically known for available (but non-approved) therapies. 
Midostaurin conferred durable responses which correlated with survival benefit, and the responses were 
further corroborated by durable reductions in bone marrow mast cell burden). For other available therapies 
such as interferon-α and cladribine, the evidence for efficacy is much weaker, and comes mostly from 
retrospective investigations (and some small single-arm studies).  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
AML indication 
The pivotal study in AML showed a clinically relevant improvement of OS by addition of midostaurin to 
standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy, followed by continuation therapy with midostaurin for 12 
cycles. This was supported by improvements on all relevant secondary endpoints. Therefore, clinically 
relevant efficacy of midostaurin in newly diagnosed FLT3 positive AML was demonstrated in the overall 
studied population.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy in the elderly: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/516229/2017 
Page 153/209 
 
  
  
The applicant should submit by September 2021 the final results of study ADE02T, a phase II, single-arm, 
investigator-initiated study of midostaurin in combination with intensive induction, consolidation including 
allogenic SCT and single agent maintenance in patients aged 18-70 with FLT3 ITD mutated AML. 
The applicant should submit by December 2022 the final results of study A2408, a single-arm multi-centre 
study to assess safety and efficacy of midostaurin in combination with standard chemotherapy during 
induction and consolidation, followed by 12 months of midostaurin monotherapy in adult patients (aged ≥ 18 
years) with newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML. 
The applicant should submit by June 2023  the results of study E2301, a randomised, double-blind study of 
midostaurin versus placebo in combination with chemotherapy during induction and consolidation, followed 
by 12 months of midostaurin monotherapy in adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with newly diagnosed AML, 
without FLT3 mutation. The protocol includes a comprehensive collection of baseline data (including 
biomarkers), post-study treatments, and evaluation of MRD. 
ASM/SM-AHN/MCL indication 
Objective and durable responses according to IWG criteria were observed in 28.3% of the patients, with 
60%, 21% and 33% of the patients with ASM, SM-AHNMD, and MCL, respectively, having a response. The 
responses were durable in a relevant proportion of patients and durability correlated with the magnitude of 
response. Furthermore, the responses are supported by solid evidence of pharmacodynamic activity, i.e., 
clear improvements in mast cell burden and further supported by reductions in serum tryptase. 
Based on the benefit in ORR and duration, it is considered that the efficacy of midostaurin for the treatment 
of patients with ASM, SM-AHNMD, and MCL has been demonstrated.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Midostaurin has been evaluated in an extensive clinical program including more than 1800 subjects, including 
one large, placebo-controlled study of midostaurin in combination with chemotherapy in FLT3-mutated AML, 
two Phase 2 studies in the ASM/SM-AHN/MCL indication, nine Phase 1-2 studies conducted in various 
indications (advanced solid tumours, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL)), 
and 11 clinical pharmacology studies. 
The AML safety database consists of 345 patients from Study A2301 who received midostaurin in combination 
with chemotherapy, and 164 patients with AML/advanced MDS from Studies A2106 (midostaurin in 
combination with chemotherapy) and A2104E1 (single agent midostaurin). The focus of the safety evaluation 
of midostaurin in AML is primarily based on the results of Study A2301, with the other studies as key 
supportive studies for the AML indication. 
The evaluation of safety of midostaurin in ASM/SM-AHN/MCL  is based on pooled safety data from patients in 
Study D2201 and Study A2213 who received at least one dose of single agent midostaurin at a dose of 100 
mg b.i.d. (ASM/SM-AHN/MCL, pooled dataset, N=142). 
In addition, 349 other patients with AML (Study A2104 and A2104E2; not dosed at 50 mg b.i.d. midostaurin), 
other haematological malignancies, solid tumours and diabetes and 504 healthy subjects contribute to the 
overall safety assessment for both indications. 
Specific safety studies have been performed to evaluate the effect of midostaurin on cardiac conduction 
intervals (Study A2113) and the use of midostaurin in patients with hepatic impairment (Study A2116).

Patient exposure 
AML 
Of the 717 patients enrolled in study A2301, 680 patients were included in the safety set; 345 patients in the 
midostaurin group and 335 patients in the placebo group. Of note, 2 patients who were randomised to the 
placebo arm received only midostaurin during the study and were therefore analysed in the midostaurin 
group for the safety analysis, and patients who were never treated with study drug were excluded from the 
safety analyses.  
Of the whole patient population, 120 patients in the midostaurin arm and 85 patient in the control arm 
entered the continuation phase. The median duration of exposure was 34 days (range 1-465 days), and 73 
patients (21.2%) in the midostaurin group and 51 patients (15.2%) in the control group were exposed to 
study drug for at least 12 months. The median time of follow-up (i.e. from the date of randomisation to data 
cut-off) was 60.2 months (range 42 to 81 months) overall, and similar in both treatment arms.  
The exposure to chemotherapy (daunorubicin, induction phase only and cytarabine, induction and 
consolidation phase), was similar in both treatment arms throughout the induction and consolidation phases. 
Almost all patients (98.5%) received at least 1 concomitant medication. During induction phase no clear 
differences in co-medication was noted. Some differences in co-medications were present during 
consolidation (higher frequency of use of levofloxasin (50 vs 41%) and dexamethasone 54 vs 47%) in the 
midostaurin arm ) and continuation (slightly higher frequency in the midostaurin arm of paracetamol (13% vs 
4%) sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (12 vs 6%) and ondansetron (13% vs 2.5%)). 
A summary of study drug exposure overall and by treatment phase is dispayed in Table 88.

ASM/SM-AHN/MCL  
All patients enrolled in Study D2201 and Study A2213 received at least one dose of midostaurin and were 
included in the safety set. Per protocol in Study D2201 patients received midostaurin at a dose of 100 mg 
b.i.d. continuously in cycles of 28 days until disease progression, intolerable toxicity or withdrawal due to any 
other cause, whichever occurred first. In Study A2213 per protocol patients could receive up to 12 cycles of 
midostaurin, each cycle was 28 days in duration; however, if a patient did not achieve a major or partial 
response in first two months treatment was to be discontinued. 
The median duration of exposure was 11.4 months (longest duration of exposure was 81 months), and 
48.6% and 33.8% of patients had at least 12 months and 24 months of exposure, respectively. The mean 
relative dose intensity was 90% of the intended daily dose, the dose intensity was slightly higher in study 
A2213 than in study D2201. 
All patients had at least 1 concomitant medication. In Study D2201 following Amendment 2, prophylaxis for 
the prevention of nausea and vomiting was to be administered to all patients. In Study A2213, prophylaxis 
for the prevention of nausea and vomiting was also recommended to be taken prior to each dose of 
midostaurin.

Adverse events 
AML 
In Study A2301 the collection of safety data, i.e. the collection of AEs and SAEs differed between the North 
America (NA) and non-North America (NNA) regions due to the difference in sponsorship. In NA region Grade 
1 and 2 events were not collected, with the exception of 13 pre-specified groups of AEs 
(neutrophils/granulocytes, platelets, haemoglobin, febrile neutropenia, ataxia (incoordination), 
rash/desquamation, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, keratitis, fatigue, left ventricular systolic dysfunction and 
mucositis/stomatitis), whereas in NNA (where Novartis is the sponsor), all AEs regardless of grade were 
collected. Due to the difference in the way AEs were collected in NA, compared to other regions (NNA), the 
safety data are presented separately as well as combined for the two regions. One third (236 patients, 
32.9%) were randomised in the NA region, and 481 patients in the NNA region. 
All patients in Study A2301 experienced at least one AE of any grade. All but one patient in the midostaurin 
group experienced at least one grade 3/4 AE. The majority of events were reported during the induction and 
consolidation phases and events were less frequently reported during the continuation phase.

* Pre-specified AEs in the NA region 
Preferred terms are sorted with first the expected AEs, then the non-expected AEs, and then in descending frequency, as 
reported in the MIDOSTAURIN – Grade 3-4 – All sites column. 
A patient with multiple occurrences of an AE is counted only once in the AE category. 
AEs with a missing grade are excluded from the table but appear in [Study A2301]. 
The most frequent AEs overall were those associated with myelosuppression and these AEs comprised also 
the most frequent grade 3-4 AEs.  
Adverse events of any grade occurring more frequently (difference of ≥ 5% in the overall population) in the 
midostaurin group than in the placebo group at all sites included nausea (82% vs 73%) and stomatitis (19% 
vs 12%). Of note, the frequency of grade 3/4 nausea was lower in the midostaurin group than in the placebo 
group (5.8% vs 10.1%, respectively). The increase in device-related infections in the midostaurin arm, as 
noted in the frequencies in grade 3/4 events (16 vs 10%), is also evident from the overall frequencies of 
device related infections (24% vs 17%, NNA sites only). Based on the AE collection in the NNA sites also 
headache (46% vs 38%), back pain (22% vs 16%) and petechiae (36% vs 27%) occurred more frequent in 
the midostaurin arm. 
Bleeding events occurred in similar proportion of patients in the midostaurin (59.0%) and placebo (57.5%) 
groups in NNA sites; however grade 3/4 events were slightly more common in the midostaurin group. The 
Assessment report

most frequently reported events were petechiae (35.8% vs 27.0%, midostaurin vs control arm respectively), 
epistaxis (27.5% vs 23.5%) and hematoma (16.2% vs 16.8%) among patients in NNA sites. The majority of 
bleeding events occurred during the induction (48.9% vs 44.6%) and consolidation (42.2% vs 53.8%) 
phases, with few events occurring in the continuation phase (6.0% vs 10.7%) in NNA sites. 
Grade 3/4 AEs occurring more frequently (>5%) in the midostaurin group than in the placebo group at all 
sites included exfoliative dermatitis (14% vs 8%, mostly due to a higher incidence in the induction phase) 
and device related infections (16% vs 10%, due to a higher incidence in the consolidation phase). 
Over 75% of patients in either treatment group experienced at least one grade 3/4 AE suspected to be 
related to midostaurin/placebo treatment. Most of these AEs occurred at similar frequencies in both 
treatment groups.

1For trial sites in North America, all grades were collected for 13 pre-specified adverse events. For 
all other adverse events, only grades 3 and 4 were collected. Therefore all grade AEs are 
summarised only for patients in non-North American trial sites, whereas Grades 3 and 4 are 
summarised for patients in all trial sites.

ASM/SM-AHN/MCL  
In the ASM/SM-AHN/MCL pool, all patients had at least 1 AE.  
Table 90. Overview of frequency of adverse events in ASM/SM-AHN/MCL (Safety set) 
The most frequently reported AEs in the pooled dataset were those related to GI toxicity (nausea, vomiting, 
and diarrhoea), infections, and myelosuppression (anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia). Other frequent 
AEs (>25% of patients) were oedema peripheral, fatigue, pyrexia, and headache . The most frequent grade 
3-4 AEs were those related to myelosuppression (anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia). All other 
grade 3-4 AEs were reported in <10% of patients each.  
The nature and incidence of AEs reported was similar (< 15%) across the 2 studies (D2201 vs A2213) with 
the exception of diarrhoea (all grade 56.0 vs 30.8%), fatigue (26.7% vs 50.0%), constipation (25.0% vs 
46.2%), musculoskeletal pain (15.5% vs 0%), abdominal distention (5.2% vs 23.1%), abdominal pain 
(29.3% vs 11.5%).

Among the ASM/SM-AHN/MCL  patients haematological events at baseline were reported; anaemia in 51.4% 
of patients thrombocytopenia in 40.1%, neutropenia in 7.7%, leukopenia in 7.0%, and eosinophilia in 7.0%. 
Also in ASM/SM-AHN/MCL  patients, GI related events have been consistently reported at high rates in 
published literature. Bleeding events were reported in 38% of patients. The most commonly reported were 
epistaxis (12%), contusion (6.3%) and hematoma (6.3%). Grade 3/4 events were reported in 20 (14.1%) 
patients; the most commonly reported were gastrointestinal haemorrhage (5 patients) and epistaxis (4 
patients). Psychiatric disorder-related events were reported in 34.5% of patients in the ASM/SM-AHN/MCL  
pool. Depression was reported in 14 patients (9.9%) and anxiety in 9 patients (6.3%). Symptoms of 
psychiatric disorders at baseline were reported in 35.9% in advanced SM pool; depression in 18.3%, major 
depression in 0.7% and anxiety in 14.1% of patients and appears to be consistent with literature reports. 
Left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) was monitored for 64 patients during treatment. LVEF changes over 
time show that around month 3 there is a decrease in the mean LVEF, and 3 patients had clear LVEF changes 
(reduction) from baseline. 
AEs related to study drug were reported in 93.7% of patients; 93.1% in Study D2201 and 96.2% in Study 
A2213. The most commonly occurring AEs suspected to be study drug related were gastrointestinal-related, 
and the majority of these were grade 1 or 2 in severity. Among the patients with nausea and vomiting, the 
majority of the events were suspected to be related to study drug.

AEs of special interest 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
In AML GI-related AEs were common among patients in Study A2301 (95.6% vs 91.6% for midostaurin vs. 
placebo, all grades at NNA sites). Grade 3-4 GI events were reported for 22.7% vs 22.6% (midostaurin vs 
placebo, NNA sites). The incidence and severity of diarrhoea was similar for midostaurin vs placebo (70.3% 
vs 71.7%, all grades at NNA sites, and 16.2% vs 13.3%, grade 3-4 AEs, NNA sites). In contrast, the 
incidences of nausea and vomiting of any grade were slightly higher in the midostaurin group (nausea: 
83.4% vs 70.4%; vomiting 60.3% vs 52.7%, NNA sites), whereas grade 3-4 events were infrequent and 
were slightly more common in the placebo group (nausea 6.6% vs 8.4%; vomiting 2.2% vs 3.1%, NNA 
sites). 
In the ASM/SM-AHN/MCL pool, the most frequently reported events were nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, 
and the majority were of mild severity with a low proportion of patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 AEs or 
SAEs of any grade. 
The GI-related adverse events reported from the midostaurin treatment groups in ASM/SM-AHN/MCL and 
AML studies were mainly nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. The majority of events were reported by 
investigators to be related to the administration of midostaurin or treatment regimen, mild to moderate in 
severity, not serious, and occurred within the first 6 months of treatment. These events were generally 
manageable with anti-emetic therapy and supportive measures. Dose adjustment or interruption was less 
commonly required and permanent discontinuation of therapy was infrequent (<2%). Similar findings have 
been seen in other studies in the midostaurin programme.

Hematologic adverse events 
In the ASM/SM-AHN/MCL population, many patients had cytopenias at baseline associated with their disease. 
In study A2301 (AML) there was a high frequency of haematological-related events; however, this was likely 
attributable to the combination of treatment with chemotherapy.  
In AML patients the majority of patients had anaemia-related events (NNA: midostaurin 97.8% vs placebo 
97.3%) and most were grade 3 or 4 (93.9% vs. 89.4%). No clear difference was observed between the 
midostaurin group and the control group. No discontinuations due to anaemia were reported. Anaemia-
related events were reported in 33.1% of ASM/SM-AHN/MCL patients, (grade 3 or 4 in 23.2% and considered 
related to study drug in 8.5% of patients). Treatment-emergent or worsening grade 3 or 4 haemoglobin 
laboratory values were reported in 40.2% of patients. SAE of anaemia was reported in 6 patients and 4 
patients required dose adjustment or interruption; however, no patient discontinued treatment due to 
anaemia.  
All AML patients in study A2301 reported leukopenia-related events and all were grade 3/4 in severity. The 
most commonly occurring were neutrophil count decreased (96.5% vs 97.8%) and febrile neutropenia 
(83.4% vs 80.5%). There was no discernible difference in the incidence of leukopenia-related events 
including neutropenia (grade 4) or in the time to resolution between midostaurin and placebo treatment 
groups. Leukopenia-related events were reported in 32 (22.5%) ASM/SM-AHN/MCL patients. Neutropenia 
was reported in 19 patients (13.4%) and febrile neutropenia was reported in 11 patients (7.7%). Dose 
adjustment or interruption was required in 8 patients for neutropenia and 2 patients for febrile neutropenia. 
The absolute neutrophil count decreased during the first 2 weeks on midostaurin treatment, and then 
remained stable between 3-4 x 109/L during the remainder of the study. 
Thrombocytopenia-related events: In the AML study 97% of patients in each treatment group reported at 
least 1 event of platelet count decreased (grade 3/4 97.8% vs 96.9%). The incidence of thrombocytopenia 
was similar in the two treatment groups, although there was a slight trend towards an increased number of 
units of transfused platelets with midostaurin treatment. In the ASM/SM-AHN/MCL population 
thrombocytopenia –related events were reported by 31 (21.8%) patients. Dose adjustment/ interruption was 
required in 6 patients, 2 patients discontinued due the an event of thrombocytopenia. 
Infections 
In Study A2301 (AML), the incidence infections (SOC) was similar in the treatment arms (NNA all grades, 
midostaurin 69.9% and placebo 69.0%). The most commonly reported events in all sites were device related 
infections (16.2% vs 10.1%), pneumonia (13.0% vs 14.0%) and sepsis (7.0% vs 7.5%). AEs related to 
infection leading to discontinuation were reported for 2 patients in each group. Deaths due to infection 
occurred less frequently in the midostaurin (4 sepsis, 1 infectious colitis,1 septic shock) compared to the 
placebo group (6 sepsis, 1 infectious colitis, 1 septic shock). 
Infections were reported in 63.4% of ASM/SM-AHN/MCL patients. Grade 3/4 infections (SOC) were reported 
in 28.9% of patients; the most commonly reported were sepsis (n=10; 7.7%) and pneumonia (n=10; 7.0%). 
Urinary tract infections were reported in 19 patients. Infection-related events lead to study drug 
discontinuation in 3 patients (pneumonia, sepsis and urinary tract infection). Six on-treatment deaths were 
related to infections and infestations (5 sepsis and 1 pneumonia) in the ACM/MCL population. 
Cardiac dysfunction 
In the AML study cardiac failure AEs (any grade) were reported for 1.3% of patients in both the midostaurin 
and placebo groups (NNA sites). Cardiac related deaths (cardiac arrest (related), myocardial infarction 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/516229/2017 
Page 166/209 
 
  
  
(possibly related)) occurred in the midostaurin group and myocardial ischemia (related; placebo) occurred in 
the placebo group. 
In the ASM/SM-AHN/MCL pool, events related to cardiac failure were reported in 10 patients (8.6%), the 
most commonly reported events were cardiac failure in 5 patients (4.3%) and pulmonary oedema in 3 
patients (2.6%). No patients discontinued due to events of cardiac failure, 5 patients died due to a cardiac 
disorder-related events (see Table 98). Cardiac failure events were more commonly reported among elderly 
patients (≥  60 years; 8.9% vs < 60 years; 3.8 %). 
LVEF 
In the AML study LVEF was only assessed at baseline. In the ASM/SM-AHN/MCL pool baseline and at least 
one post-baseline LVEF assessment were available for 64 patients. Echocardiography was not centrally read. 
The LVEF changes over time show that around month 3 there is a decrease in the mean LVEF. Three patients 
had notable LVEF changes from baseline (defined as a new LVEF compared to baseline of < 50% or < 45% 
with/without a decrease by > 10% or > 20%):  
1 patient (aged 58) had a baseline LVEF of 50% which decreased at Cycle 6 to 41%. No subsequent LVEFs 
were reported;  1 patient (aged 68) had a baseline LVEF of 65% which decreased to 49% at Cycle 3. 
Subsequent LVEFs were >60% (Cycle 6), and 59% (Cycle 12); 1 patient (aged 72) had a baseline LVEF of 
60% which decreased to 45% at Cycle 3. At Cycle 6, the LVEF was reported to be >60%. 
None of these patients had reported cardiac AEs concurrent with the LVEF nadirs.

QTc prolongation 
Notable QTcF events reported inStudy A2301 are shown in Table 95. 
Table 93. Notable QTcF abnormalities by treatment phase and overall (Safety set) - Study A2301 
In Study A2301, QTc prolongation AEs (any grade) were reported in 24.0% vs 21.2% of patients in the 
midostaurin vs. control groups, respectively (NNA sites), primarily ECG QT prolonged (19.2% vs. 16.8%) and 
syncope (5.2% vs. 4.9%).  The proportion of patients with notable abnormalities in cardiac conduction 
intervals on ECGs was higher overall in the midostaurin vs placebo groups (QTcF >480 ms: 10.1% vs 5.7%; 
QTcF >500 ms: 6.2% vs 2.6%; >60 ms increase from baseline: 18.4% vs 10.7%, PR > 25% increase from 
baseline and > 200 ms: 0.4% vs 0.5% and HR > 25% increase from baseline and > 100 ms: 7.0% vs 
5.6%). 
ASM/SM-AHN/MCL QT prolongation-related events were reported in 16.2% of patients; the most commonly 
reported event was ECG QT prolonged (15 patients; 10.6%) and resulted in discontinuation in 3 patients. A 
further 2 patients discontinued due to events of cardiac arrest and ventricular tachycardia (events included in 
the QT prolongation standard MedDRA query). Notable QTcF events are shown in Table 96.

Page 168/209 
 
  
  
  
Table 94. Notable QTc values in ASM/SM-AHN/MCL  safety pool 
In Study D2201, there were specific criteria for dose adjustment or study drug discontinuation with regard to 
QT interval values. In 10 patients (8.6%) dose reduction/interruption due to QT prolonged events was 
reported.  
A linear mixed effects model was used to fit the change from baseline in QTcF as a response variable, with 
log-transformed concentration (of midostaurin and both metabolites), baseline QTcF and relevant covariates 
(identified through backwards selection) fitted as fixed effects. A negative effect of concentration was 
observed on ΔQTcF for all three analytes. 
Pulmonary toxicity 
In AML, in Study A2301 pulmonary toxicities were assessed based on 2 groupings of events: interstitial lung 
disease (ILD), and pulmonary edema. ILD cases were balanced between the treatment groups (13.5% 
midostaurin vs 14.2% placebo; NNA sites); primarily pneumonitis (11.4% vs 12.8%). Seven patients (3.1% 
midostaurin group) and 15 patients (6.6%, placebo group) had an event of pulmonary toxicity which was 
suspected to be related to study treatment. SAEs were reported in 14 midostaurin-treated patient and 13 
placebo treated patients, with 11 patients in each group having pneumonitis. One on-treatment death due to 
pneumonitis was recorded in the midostaurin group. 
Pulmonary oedema was experienced by 1 patient in the midostaurin group; the event was grade 1-2 in 
severity and did not lead to discontinuation. 
In Study ADE02T (n=145), pulmonary haemorrhages were reported in 21 patients, 1 died; in 5 patients 
events were suspected to be related to study drug by the investigator of which 1 was grade 3/4. Most of 
these occurred in the induction and early consolidation phases. One event each pneumonitis and pulmonary 
haemorrhage were reported as serious adverse events and both were assessed as not related. No treatment 
discontinuation resulted from events of pneumonitis or pulmonary haemorrhage. 
In Study A2104 (n=20), 1 patient died due to grade 4 SAE of bronchopneumonia and 1 patient experienced a 
grade 2 SAE of alveolar haemorrhage that was not suspected to be related to study drug.  
For the ASM/SM-AHN/MCL studies patients were excluded from enrolment if they had evidence of pulmonary 
infiltrates and were not considered for study inclusion unless all the pulmonary infiltrates had resolved. In 
Study A2301, dose adjustment/interruptions were recommended if a patient experienced a ≥  grade 3 
pulmonary infiltration event. 
In the ASM/SM-AHN/MCL safety pool interstitial lung disease (pulmonary toxicity) was reported in 5 (3.5%) 
patients, of which 1 was suspected to be treatment-related. No deaths were related to pulmonary toxicity.

Skin toxicity 
In Study A2301 (AML), the incidence of any grade skin toxicities was similar in the treatment groups, overall 
and in the induction phase. However, during the induction phase, grade 3/4 skin toxicities were reported at a 
higher incidence in the midostaurin arm than in the placebo arm (14.0% midostaurin vs. 7.2% placebo; 
10.9% vs 4.1% dermatitis exfoliative). The high proportion of patients with rash and desquamation may 
partially be explained by concomitant use of vancomycin. Among patients from all sites, 4 patients in the 
midostaurin group had an AE of skin toxicity which led to discontinuation of study treatment (3 during the 
induction phase, 1 during the consolidation phase). No case of severe or fatal skin toxicity (e.g. Stevens- 
Johnsons syndrome) was reported. 
Sporadic cases of skin toxicity were observed in ASM/SM-AHN/MCL patients; in Study D2201, 4 patients 
reported grade 3 toxic skin eruption and in Study A2213 1 patient reported grade 2 erythema multiforme. 
In supportive studies skin-related events were also commonly reported, but as control groups are lacking 
treatment relationship cannot be determined. There was one case of discontinuation due to Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome reported in Study A2104E1. No other severe skin reactions were reported across the midostaurin 
development programme. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
AML 
Of all deaths, 36 patients died on treatment: 15 patients (4.3%) in the midostaurin group and 21 (6.3%) 
patients in the placebo group. All but one on treatment deaths in the midostaurin group occurred during the 
induction phase, the other patient died during consolidation. In the control arm, 11 died during the induction 
phase and 9 during the consolidation phase and 1 in the continuation phase. The causes of on-treatment 
deaths are presented in Table 97. On-treatment deaths suspected to be related to study drug were balanced 
between the treatment groups: 9 patients (2.6%) versus 7 patients (2.1%) in the midostaurin and placebo 
group, respectively. 
To evaluate if midostaurin treatment had an adverse effect on the outcomes for patients who received an 
SCT, mortality was analysed at 30 days and at 100 days post SCT for patients who received an SCT within 2 
months of study drug discontinuation. The proportion of patients who died within 30 days from their SCT was 
similar in the midostaurin and placebo groups (3/88 (3.4%) and 3/86 (3.5%) patients respectively). The 
proportion of patients who died within 100 days from their SCT was slightly lower in the midostaurin group 
(6/88 (6.8%)) than the placebo group (11/86 (12.8%)).

Table 95. On-treatment deaths in study A2301 
ASM/SM-AHN/MCL  
In the pooled dataset there were 26 on-treatment deaths reported (i.e. deaths occurring on treatment and up 
to 28 days after the last dose of study drug; see Table 98). None of the deaths were considered related to 
study drug by the investigators. 
Seven (7) additional on-treatment deaths were reported after the cut-off dates of the individual studies up to 
30 April 2016 (i.e. deaths occurring on treatment and up to 28 days after the last dose of study drug, 4 
deaths in Study D2201, and 3 deaths in Study A2213) Four of these deaths (3 in Study D2201 and 1 in Study 
A2213) occurred in the context of disease progression. The causes of deaths for the 3 other patients were: 
liver and kidney failure subsequent to disseminated intravascular coagulation; progression of general decline 
in health secondary to an inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system, and sepsis related to 
complications of an infection. None of these deaths were considered to be related to study drug by the 
investigators.

Approximately half of all patients in Study A2301 experienced an SAE, with similar incidences in the 
midostaurin and placebo groups, with the exception of grade 3/4 exfoliative dermatitis and grade 3/4 
hypotension. Device related infections occurred more often in the midostaurin arm than in the control arm 
(23 (6.7%) vs 13 (3.9%). 
In study A2301 an analysis was provided for all AEs leading to hospitalization. The proportion of patients 
requiring additional or prolonged hospitalization during Cycle 1 of the induction phase was similar in the 
midostaurin and placebo groups (53.3% vs 50.4%). For patients who had a second cycle of induction 
treatment (n=81 vs n=101), the proportion of hospitalised patients was slightly higher in the midostaurin 
group (56.8%) than the placebo group (44.6%).  
ASM/SM-AHN/MCL  
In the pooled dataset, 68.3% of the patients had an SAE; the events were mostly grade 3 or 4 (62.7%) (see 
Table 100). Infections were among the most commonly reported SAEs: pneumonia and sepsis (each reported 
in 7.0% of patients) and urinary tract infection (4.2%). Other commonly reported SAEs were pleural effusion 
(4.9%), dyspnoea (4.2%), pyrexia (4.9%) and ascites (3.5%). Acute myeloid leukaemia occurred in 5 
patients (3.5%). All other SAEs were reported in 3 or fewer patients.

After the cut-off dates for the individual studies, 22 additional SAE cases were reported (up to 30 April 2016). 
Six cases were related to infections, 3 cases each were related to haematological events, gastrointestinal 
events and respiratory events, 1 case of osteonecrosis of the jaw (patient receiving alendronate), left 
ventricular failure (patient with history aortic valve stenosis and valve replacement) and cellulitis (condition 
unchanged). Other cases included events that were as expected for the patient population with ASM as 
judged by the investigators/Applicant. 
For the ASM/SM-AHN/MCL safety pool an analysis was provided of AEs requiring additional therapy. All but 1 
patient (99.3%) in the advanced SM pool had additional therapy to manage AEs.

Laboratory findings 
Haematology parameters  
AML 
In study A2301 the collection of safety laboratory values was initiated after the start of the study 
(amendment 2), therefore some of the data were collected retrospectively for non-North America (NNA) but 
not for North America (NA). Overall, shifts in haematological abnormalities were similar in the midostaurin 
and placebo group. The majority of patients experienced grade 3 and 4 cytopenias in the induction and 
consolidation treatment phases. In the continuation phase, the frequencies of newly occurring or worsening 
haemoglobin, platelets and WBC counts were similar between the treatment groups. Median time to ANC 
recovery (≥  500/μl) was similar in both treatment groups; in induction phase cycle 1 (27 and 26 days in 
midostaurin and placebo patients, respectively) and in consolidation phase cycle 1 (27 and 25 days, in 
midostaurin and placebo patients, respectively). 
ASM/SM-AHN/MCL  
In the pooled dataset, newly occurring or worsening in haematology parameters were reported in ≥  50% of 
patients. Newly occurring or worsening from baseline to grade 3 or 4 for lymphocytes and haemoglobin was 
reported for more than 40% of patients.  
An increase was seen in haemoglobin level over time, but this is confounded by red blood cell transfusions in 
a number of patients for disease-related anaemia or bleeding episodes. The median time to onset of new 
grade 3 or worse neutrophil decrease was 0.76 months. The ANC over time demonstrated a decrease within 
the first month of midostaurin treatment that remained stable thereafter. 
Clinical chemistry 
AML 
Newly occurring or worsening biochemistry abnormalities were balanced between the two treatment groups. 
Elevations to newly occurring or worsening grade 3/4 abnormalities occurred in ≥  10% of patients in both 
treatment groups for low potassium, total bilirubin and ALT. 
ASM/SM-AHN/MCL  
Newly occurring and worsening biochemistry abnormalities were mostly mild in severity (grade 1 or 2). The 
most commonly reported biochemistry abnormality was glucose increased (all grades: 79.6% of patients; 
grade 3 and 4: 18.6%), however a significant proportion of the patients had received corticosteroids on study 
(>60%). Patients with grade 3-4 glucose increases included diabetic patients and patients already 
hyperglycaemic at baseline and/or with risk factors for diabetes. Uric acid elevations were reported in 37.9% 
of patients and shifts to grade 3 or 4 were seen in 10.7% of patients, hyperuricaemia was reported as AE in 4 
patients.  Newly occurring or worsening laboratory abnormalities of creatinine increased were reported in 35 
(24.6%) patients, with AEs of creatinine increased reported in 8 patients. Newly occurring or worsening shifts 
in magnesium (decreased) were reported in 29 patients; however, no shifts occurred to grade 3 or 4. Newly 
occurring or worsening shifts in amylase was experienced in 19.7% of patients in the pooled dataset and 
grade 3 or 4 events were reported in 6.4% of patients. Lipase elevations were reported in 37.3% of patients 
in the pooled dataset and grade 3 or 4 events were reported in 17.6% of patients.  Elevations in amylase and 
lipases have been reported as AEs.

Safety in special populations 
Age 
A subgroup analysis based on age was not conducted for patients in Study A2301, as patients ≥  60 years of 
age were not eligible for the study. 
Two age subgroup analyses were conducted for the ASM/SM-AHN/MCL  safety pool: < 65 years and ≥  65 
years and < 60 years and ≥  60 years. 52 patients were < 60 years and 90 patients were ≥  60 years. The 
median duration of exposure was higher in the patients < 60 years (18.6 months) compared to patients ≥  60 
years (9.1 months);  
The number of patients who experienced AEs and SAEs were generally similar in the two age groups, while 
Grade 3/4 AEs/SAEs were reported more frequently in patients ≥  60 years (89%/68%) than in those < 60 
years (75.0%/58%). In the ≥  60 years there were more AEs leading to discontinuation (29 vs 15%) and to 
dose adjustment/interruption (62 vs 46%). Results were similar in patients when 65 years was chosen as 
cut-off (< 65 years: n=78 patients) and ≥  65 years: n=64 patients).

The Applicant has provided an analysis of grade 3/4 AEs by age group (<40 years, 40 - <50 years, and >50 
years) in pivotal AML study A2301 (Figure 24 ).  
Figure 23. Grade ¾ AEs by age reported in all age groups with a frequency of at elast 10% oin the 
midostaurin arm in study A2301(Safety Set) 
Gender 
AML  
Overall the proportion of patients with AEs was similar among male and female patients in both treatment 
groups. In the continuation phase, among the patients in the midostaurin group the incidence of grade 3 or 4 
AEs was higher in male patients (48.4%) compared to female patients (33.9%). No difference was seen in 
the incidence of events in the SOCs of blood and lymphatic disorders, infections, or gastrointestinal disorders. 
A difference was noted in the incidence on cardiac disorder grade 3/4 events (male: 18 patients; 10.7% and 
female: 6 patients; 3.4%); among the male patients grade 3 or 4 events of left ventricular dysfunction 
occurred in 6 patients and atrial fibrillation in 4 patients; however, in female patients these events occurred 
in 2 patients and 0 patients, respectively. In females diarrhoea and vomiting occurred more frequently. 
ASM/SM-AHN/MCL   
Some differences between the genders in AE reporting were noted: A higher frequency of reporting in males 
was seen for SAEs (71.4% vs. 62.7%), grade 3/4 AE (65.9% vs 58.8%), AEs leading to discontinuation (all 
grades: 29.7% vs 13.7%; grade 3/4 23.1% vs 9.8%). AEs reported more often (>10% difference) in males 
were anaemia, peripheral oedema, rash and insomnia. AEs reported more often in females were vomiting (all 
grades 80.4% vs 60.4%; grade 3/4 11.8% vs 2.2) and nausea (all grades 92.2% vs 76.9%; grade 3/4 
11.8% vs 2.2%) and (with >10% difference) tremor, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, urinary tract 
infection, flushing, and back pain. 
Notably, there is an imbalance in overall exposure with respect to gender (median duration of exposure was 
17.0 months in female patients and 11.3 months in male patients).

The Applicant concludes that no gender-related pattern could be discerned related to the proportion of 
patients with AEs overall, those requiring dose adjustment/interruption, or those requiring addition therapy 
overall. 
ECOG 
In study A2301 (AML patients) the incidence of AEs was similar regardless of ECOG status (ECOG 0-1 vs ≥ 2). 
The proportion of patients with AEs was similar regardless of ECOG status both overall and in the 
continuation phase alone.  
Hepatic function 
For the ASM/SM-AHN/MCL population a subgroup analysis was performed between patients with AEs among 
the normal hepatic function (n=106) and mild (n=23) hepatic impairment subgroups. As there were few 
patients with moderate (n=8) and severe (n=2) hepatic impairment, no meaningful conclusions could be 
made for these subgroups. There were no major differences between the proportion of patients with AEs, 
deaths, AEs leading to discontinuation or dose reduction/interruption. The incidence of SAEs was somewhat 
higher in patients with mild hepatic function impairment (65 vs. 78%). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increase the exposure of midostaurin (see PK section of this report). In the AML 
pivotal Phase 3 study A2301, patients receiving concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitors had 1.44-fold higher 
exposure to midostaurin compared to all remaining patients in the study. For the sum of active moieties at 
steady state the increase is relatively small changes consisting of 1.22 fold higher exposure in patients 
receiving strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. An overview of AEs, in patients who were treated and those were not 
treated with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors for both treatment arms are presented in Table 102 and  
Table 103).The comparison of the AE profile of subjects known to have concomitant treatment with a strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitor with that of subjects who did not, showed that in both arms the frequency of infections is 
increased in the group treated with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors when compared to those not receiving CYP3A4 
inhibitors, but that the difference in the placebo arm is less than what is seen in the midostaurin group.

Table 102. Adverse Events leading to midostaurin/placebo discontinuation- Study A2301 
Adverse events of any grade leading to treatment discontinuation were observed in 8.3% of patients in the 
midostaurin group and in 5.3% patients in the placebo group. Information on AEs leading to study drug 
interruption or dose adjustment was not collected for Study A2301, however reasons for missed/reduced 
doses were provided in the study report. The number of missed/reduced doses due to cardiac toxicities is 
numerically higher in the midostaurin group (49 (15%) vs 41 (13%). 
ASM/SM-AHN/MCL  
At the time of data cut-off for each study, 28 patients (19.7%) in the pooled ASM/SM-AHN/MCL dataset 
continued to receive study treatment, 21 in study D2201 and 7 in study A2213.

The most frequent reasons for discontinuation of study drug were disease progression (n=50) and AEs 
(n=32, 23.9%). Death was the primary reason for discontinuation in 9 of patients. The most frequent AEs 
leading to discontinuation were nausea (n=3), ascites (n=3), and ECG QT prolonged (n=3), all other AEs 
leading to discontinuation were reported in no more than 2 patients each. 
Dose interruptions were reported for 67 patients (47.2%) in the pooled safety set: 29 patients (20.4%) had 1 
dose interruption and 38 patients (26.8%) had more than 1 dose interruption.  Dose reductions were 
reported for 84 patients (59.2%) in the pooled safety set: 38 patients (26.8%) had 1 dose reduction and 46 
patients (32.4%) had more than 1 dose reduction.  AEs were the most frequent reason for dose interruptions 
(59 of 67 interruptions) and dose reductions (63 of 84 reductions), followed by dosing error. AEs leading to 
dose interruption/adjustment were most commonly related to GI events: nausea (n=12, 12.0%), vomiting 
(n=13, 9.2%) and diarrhoea (n=7, 4.9%); ECG QT prolonged events (n=10, 7.0%); haematological events: 
neutropenia (n=8, 5.6% patients), thrombocytopenia (n=6, 4.2% patients) and anaemia (n=4, 2.8% 
patients); pyrexia (n=6 4.2%), and fatigue (n=5 3.5%). 
Supportive safety studies 
Study A2106 
Study A2106 was a phase 1b, open-label, multi-centre study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK of 
twice daily oral dosing of midostaurin in newly diagnosed, previously untreated AML patients with FLT3-
mutated and FLT3-WT AML aged 18-60 years. Midostaurin was administrated either sequentially (Arm 1) or 
concomitantly (Arm 2) with standard induction therapy. Patients were treated with midostaurin at 100 mg 
b.i.d. (29 patients) or 50 mg b.i.d. (40 patients). 
After completion of consolidation therapy, patients were to continue to receive midostaurin as single-agent 
maintenance therapy according to the schedule assigned during induction. In the absence of safety concerns, 
midostaurin could be continued until relapse or for up to 3 years from the time of diagnosis. 
Overall the incidence of AEs was similar in each dose group; however AEs suspected to be related to study 
drug, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation were reported at a higher incidence in the 100 mg b.i.d. group 
compared to the 50 mg b.i.d. group.

The most frequent AEs (100 mg b.i.d. vs 50 mg b.i.d.) were those associated with myelosuppression 
(thrombocytopenia 67.9% vs 75.0%; febrile neutropenia 60.7% vs 65.0%, anaemia 28.6% vs 45.0%, 
neutropenia 28.6% vs 52.5%), gastrointestinal events (nausea 75.0% vs 77.5%, diarrhoea 71.4% vs 67.5%, 
vomiting 67.9% vs 65.0%), infections (pneumonia 28.6% vs 12.5%), LFTs (AST increased 39.3% vs 25.0%, 
ALT increased 35.7% vs 27.5%, bilirubin increased 28.6% vs 20.0%), psychiatric disorders (insomnia 25.0% 
vs 42.5%, depression 14.3% vs 25.0%), skin toxicities (alopecia 35.7% vs 27.5%, petechiae 32.1% vs 
40.0%, rash 28.6% vs 35.0%) and vascular disorders (hypotension 42.9% vs 30.0%). 
Study A2104E1 
Study A2104E1 was an open label, randomised study in patients with AML (FLT3 wild type or mutated) and in 
patients with high risk MDS who were relapsed or refractory. Patients were randomised to receive continuous 
oral dosing of either 50 mg b.i.d. or 100 mg b.i.d. midostaurin in a 28-day cycle regimen during the 
treatment period. Eighty-five (89.5%) patients with AML and 10 patients (10.5%) with MDS were included. 
The median duration of exposure was 48.0 days and was slightly higher in patients treated at 50 mg b.i.d. 
(59.0 days) compared to the 100 mg b.i.d. dosage (42 days).

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Midostaurin has been evaluated in an extensive clinical program including more than 1800 subjects 
comprising ~20 studies in various indications.  
AML  
All demographic characteristics and relevant disease characteristics were balanced between the two 
treatment arms with the exception of gender (more male patients in the midostaurin arm, 48.3% vs 40.6% 
in the placebo arm) and extramedullary disease (a higher proportion in the placebo arm, 15.8% vs 23.5%). 
The collection of data on concomitant treatments was initiated after study initiation. Almost all patients 
(98.5%) received at least 1 concomitant medication. During the induction phase no clear differences in co-
medication were noted. During consolidation therapy, a (slight) imbalance in levofloxacin and use of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/516229/2017

dexamethasone seems to be apparent, with more use in the midostaurin arm (50 vs 41% and 54 vs 47% 
respectively). During the continuation phase, an imbalance in the use of ondansetron is noted with 13% (14 
of 106) patients using this substance in the midostaurin arm vs 2.5 % (2 of 80) in the control arm, with 
apparent limited use of other anti-emetics. 
The safety evaluation of Rydapt (50 mg twice daily) in patients with newly diagnosed FLT3 mutated AML was 
based on a phase III, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study with 717 patients. The overall 
median duration of exposure was 42 days (range 2 to 576 days) for patients in the Rydapt plus standard 
chemotherapy arm versus 34 days (range 1 to 465 days) for patients in the placebo plus standard 
chemotherapy arm. For the 205 patients (120 in Rydapt arm and 85 in placebo arm) who entered the 
maintenance phase, the median duration of exposure in maintenance was 11 months for both arms (16 to 
520 days for patients in the Rydapt arm and 22 to 381 days in the placebo arm) (SmPC, section 4.8). 
All patients in Study A2301 experienced at least one AE of any grade regardless of relation with study drug. 
All but one patient in the midostaurin group experienced at least one grade 3/4 AE. The majority of events 
were reported during the induction and consolidation phases and events were less frequently reported during 
the continuation phase. Notably, the absence of chemotherapy administration is the most likely reason for 
the lower frequency of AEs in the continuation phase (=monotherapy midostaurin vs. placebo). However, 
selection of patients with lower sensitivity for AEs/toxicity might have contributed as well. 
The most frequent AEs overall were those associated with myelosuppression and these AEs comprised also 
the most frequent grade 3-4 AEs (occurring in >95% of the study population). The myelosuppression is most 
likely due to the chemotherapy, however a potential contribution of midostaurin to haematological toxicity 
cannot be ruled out. Of note, also for the myelosuppression events frequencies in the continuation phase 
were low. 
Over 75% of patients in either treatment group experienced at least one grade 3/4 AE suspected to be 
related to treatment. These AEs occurred at similar frequencies in both treatment groups. 
The most frequent adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the Rydapt arm were febrile neutropenia (83.4%), 
nausea (83.4%), exfoliative dermatitis (61.6%), vomiting (60.7%), headache (45.9%), petechiae (35.8%) 
and pyrexia (34.5%). The most frequent Grade 3/4 ADRs were febrile neutropenia (83.5%), lymphopenia 
(20.0%), device related infection (15.7%), exfoliative dermatitis (13.6%), hyperglycaemia (7.0%) and 
nausea (5.8%) (SmPC, section 4.8). 
Bleeding events occurred in similar proportions of patients in the midostaurin (59.0%) and placebo (57.5%) 
groups in NNA sites; however, grade 3/4 events were slightly more common in the midostaurin group. The 
most frequently reported events were petechiae (35.8% vs 27.0%), epistaxis (27.5% vs 23.5%), 
haematoma (16.2% vs 16.8%). 
GI events were among the most commonly reported AEs (diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting > 55%). This high 
incidence was attributed to chemotherapy treatment. The incidence and severity of diarrhoea was similar for 
midostaurin vs. placebo, but the incidences of nausea and vomiting of any grade were slightly higher in the 
midostaurin group (nausea: 83.4% vs 70.4%; vomiting 60.3% vs 52.7%, NNA sites). Also stomatitis 
occurred more frequently in the midostaurin group than in placebo (19% vs 12%). Based on the AE collection 
in the NNA sites only, headache (46% vs 38%), back pain (22% vs 16%) and petechiae (36% vs 27%) 
occurred more frequent in the midostaurin arm. 
Approximately half of all patients experienced an SAE with similar incidences in the midostaurin and control 
group, except for grade 3/4 exfoliative dermatitis (10 vs 1 pt), grade 3/4 hypotension (10 vs 1 pt) and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/516229/2017 
Page 184/209 
 
  
  
possibly also device related infections (23 vs 13 pt) which were reported more often in the midostaurin 
group.  
In Study A2301, a total of 36 patients died on treatment: 15 patients (4.3%) in the midostaurin group and 
21 (6.3%) patients in the placebo group. Of these on-treatment deaths 16 were suspected to be related to 
study drug: 9 patients (2.6%) in the midostaurin and 7 patients (2.1%) and control group. Among the 14 
patients who died on-treatment in the midostaurin group due to causes other than disease progression it is 
noted that there was one case of cardiac arrest and 2 patients for whom QTc > 450 ms was recorded (1 died 
due to myocardial infarction, the other due to colitis). An analysis of the mortality early post SCT (within 30 
days or 100 days) did not provide a cause for concern on a possible effect of midostaurin treatment on SCT 
treatment-related mortality. 
The most frequent laboratory abnormalities were haemoglobin decreased (97.3%), ANC decreased (86.7%), 
ALT increased (84.2%), AST increased (73.9%) and hypokalaemia (61.7%). The most frequent Grade 3/4 
laboratory abnormalities were ANC decreased (85.8%), haemoglobin decreased (78.5%), ALT increased 
(19.4%) and hypokalaemia (13.9%) (SmPC, section 4.8). 
Discontinuation due to any adverse reaction occurred in 3.1% of patients in the Rydapt arm versus 1.3% in 
the placebo arm. The most frequent Grade 3/4 adverse reaction leading to discontinuation in the Rydapt arm 
was exfoliative dermatitis (1.2%)(SmPC, section 4.8). 
When the maintenance phase (single agent Rydapt or placebo) was assessed separately, a difference in the 
type and severity of ADRs was observed. The overall incidence of ADRs during the maintenance phase was 
generally lower than during the induction and consolidation phase. Incidences of ADRs were, however, higher 
in the Rydapt arm than in the placebo arm during the maintenance phase. ADRs occurring more often in the 
midostaurin arm versus placebo during maintenance included: nausea (46.4% versus 17.9%), 
hyperglycaemia (20.2% versus 12.5%), vomiting (19% versus 5.4%) and QT prolongation (11.9% versus 
5.4%)(SmPC, section 4.8). 
Most of the haematological abnormalities reported occurred during the induction and consolidation phase 
when the patients received Rydapt or placebo in combination with chemotherapy. The most frequent 
Grade 3/4 haematological abnormalities reported in patients during the maintenance phase with Rydapt were 
ANC decrease (20.8% versus 18.8%) and leukopenia (7.5% versus 5.9%)(SmPC, section 4.8). 
ADRs reported during the maintenance phase led to discontinuation of 1.2% of patients in the Rydapt arm 
and none in the placebo arm (SmPC, section 4.8). 
Subgroup analysis based on age was not conducted for patients in Study A2301, as patients ≥ 60 years of 
age were not eligible for the study. In study ADE02T two age groups were studied: patients aged ≤ 60 and 
patients aged >60, however an analysis of differences in the AE profile between these groups was not 
provided. An analysis of the data in the study report did not reveal major differences, except treatment 
related mortality, which occurred at a higher frequency in the >60 years of age population. Most of the 
deaths were early or hypoplastic deaths and were observed during the first or second induction cycles. While 
age might have contributed to the apparent reduced capability to recover from the effects of high dose 
chemotherapy (some of the) older patients, also the more aggressive disease in the elderly may also have 
played a role. However given the MoA of midostaurin and its safety profile, a contribution of midostaurin to 
thease early death, in particular those attributed to the inability to restore haematopoiesis cannot be 
excluded.   
In this analysis of grade 3/4 AEs by age group (<40 years, 40 - <50 years, and >50 years) there appeared 
to be no notable differences in the safety of midostaurin across age groups. High level analyses of data on

the safety profile of midostaurin in older patients collected in the monotherapy setting were also provided. In 
AML study A2104E1, the majority of the enrolled patients were ≥ 60 years of age (80 of 95 patients). The 
results of subgroup analyses by age groups <60 years vs ≥ 60 years showed that there were no clinically 
relevant differences in the incidences of AEs, SAEs, discontinuations and other clinically significant events in 
the two age subgroups. Similarly also the results for subgroup analyses conducted using pooled data from 
studies A2104, A2104E1, A2104E2, and A2114 (patients with AML/MDS/ALL), which included 57 patients <60 
years of age and 107 patients ≥ 60 years of age, were consistent with these findings. 
The proportion of patients with AEs was similar among male and female patients in both treatment groups. 
The frequency of vomiting and diarrhoea was higher in females than in males (81% vs. 70% for diarrhoea 
and 68% vs. 54% for vomiting), which is in part explained by the longer exposure in females. A difference 
was noted in the incidence of cardiac disorder grade 3/4 events (male: 18 patients; 10.7% and female: 6 
patients; 3.4%); among the male patients grade 3 or 4 events of left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 6 
patients and atrial fibrillation in 4 patients; however, in female patients these events occurred in 2 patients 
and 0 patients, respectively. 
ASM/SM-AHN/MCL 
In the pooled population 90 (63%) patients were ≥ 60 years of age and 39 (28%) were ≥ 70 years of age. 
The majority of patients were Caucasian, and there was a higher proportion of males (64.1%). The majority 
of patients had an ECOG status of 1 or 2. In total 102 patients had a diagnosis of SM with AHNMD and 25 
patients had a diagnosis of SM without AHNMD. Overall, 27 patients were diagnosed as having MCL and 
among those 12 had a co-existing AHNMD. The most commonly occurring AHNMD subtypes were chronic 
myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) (32.4%) and MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasms-unclassifiable (MPN-U) 
(23.2%).  
All but 1 patient in the pooled dataset had at least 1 comorbidity at study start, and all patients had at least 1 
concomitant medication. 
The safety of Rydapt (100 mg twice daily) as a single agent in patients with ASM, SM AHN and MCL was 
evaluated in 142 patients in two single arm, open label, multicentre studies. The median duration of exposure 
to Rydapt was 11.4 months (range: 0 to 81 months) (SmPC, section 4.8). 
All patients had at least 1 AE of any grade. The most frequently reported AEs in the pooled dataset were 
those related to GI toxicity (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea), infections, and myelosuppression (anaemia, 
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia). Other frequent AEs (>25% of patients) were peripheral oedema, fatigue, 
pyrexia, and headache. The most frequent grade 3/4 AEs were those related to myelosuppression (anaemia, 
thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia). 
The most common AEs are those that are also associated with the disease. As in ASM/SM-AHN/MCL only 
single arm studies have been performed by the Applicant, the analysis of AEs is severely complicated by the 
(evolution of) the underlying condition and also the co-morbidities of the patients. 
Bleeding events were reported in 38% of patients. The most commonly reported bleeding events were 
epistaxis (12%), contusion (6.3%) and haematoma (6.3%). Grade 3/4 events were reported in 20 (14.1%) 
patients; the most commonly reported were gastrointestinal haemorrhage (5 patients) and epistaxis (4 
patients).  
Psychiatric disorder-related events were reported in 34.5% of patients in the ASM/SM-AHN/MCL pool. 
Depression was reported in 14 patients (9.9%) and anxiety in 9 patients (6.3%). Symptoms of psychiatric 
disorders at baseline were reported in 35.9% in the ASM/SM-AHN/MCL pool.

Pleural effusion was seen in 18 patients (13%) of which 8 patients (4%) had pleural effusion grade 3/4. 
Interstitial lung disease was reported in 5 patients (3.5%), of which 1 was suspected to be treatment-related. 
Skin toxicities were observed in ASM/SM-AHN/MCL patients with 4 cases (2.8%) of grade 3 toxic skin 
eruption and 1 grade 2 erythema multiforme. 
QT prolongation-related adverse events were reported in 16.2% of patients. An increase from baseline with > 
30 msec was observed in 46 (36%) of the patients and of > 60 msec in 8 (6.3%) patients. 
AEs related to study drug were reported in 133 (93.7%) patients. The most commonly occurring AEs 
suspected to be study drug related were gastrointestinal-related (nausea, vomiting diarrhoea), and the 
majority of those were grade 1 or 2 in severity.  
The most frequent ADRs were nausea (82%), vomiting (68%), diarrhoea (51%), peripheral oedema (35%) 
and fatigue (31%). The most frequent Grade 3/4 ADRs were fatigue (8.5%), sepsis (7.7%), pneumonia 
(7%), febrile neutropenia (7%), and diarrhoea (6.3%). The most frequent non haematological laboratory 
abnormalities were hyperglycaemia (93.7%), total bilirubin increased (40.1%), lipase increased (39.4%), 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased (33.8%), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased 
(33.1%), while the most frequent haematological laboratory abnormalities were absolute lymphocyte count 
decreased (73.2%) and ANC decreased (58.5%) (SmPC, section 4.8). 
Serious ADRs occurred at similar rates in patients in the Rydapt versus the placebo arm. The most frequent 
serious ADR in both arms was febrile neutropenia (16%) (SmPC, section 4.8). 
In the pooled safety dataset there were 26 (18%) on-treatment deaths reported. While no clear pattern in 
the cause of the on-treatment deaths was noted, 5 were due to cardiac disorders (2 cardiac arrest, 1 
disorder, 1 failure and 1 congestive failure). This seems rather high, but given the age of the patients, the 
absence of a control group and variability in the type of cardiac disorders no definitive conclusions can be 
drawn from the provided data. 
The most frequent Grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities were absolute lymphocyte count decreased (45.8%), 
ANC decreased (26.8%), hyperglycaemia (19%), and lipase increased (17.6%) (SmPC, section 4.8). 
The safety data collected in the ASM/SM-AHN/MCL population is of limited value for assessment of possible 
effects of midostaurin on haematological parameters because of the uncontrolled nature of the trial and the 
fact that the disease is accompanied by haematological abnormalities. Of note, during study D2201, 59 of 
116 patients received RBC transfusions, 27 of which did not have transfusion-dependent anaemia at baseline. 
Platelet transfusions were given to 17 patients. However, it cannot be determined whether this increase in 
transfusion-dependent subjects is caused by midostaurin or due to progressive disease. In addition, newly 
occurring and worsening biochemistry abnormalities were commonly seen, but most were mild in severity. 
The most commonly reported biochemistry abnormality was glucose increased (all grades: 79.6% of 
patients; grade 3 and 4 : 18.6%). An additional analysis was made using the broad Pancreatitis SMQ to 
identify potential cass of pancreatitis by looking for patients in whom an event of lab abnormality and a 
clinical symptom indicative of pancreatits occurred within the time frame of 1 days. Several cases were found 
with events that may be seen as indicative for pancreatitis (lab abnormality + at least clinical symptom) (10 
from ASM trials and 19 in Novartis Argus safety database). Importantly, none of these cases were diagnosed 
as pancreatitis. In addition a search of the Novartis Argus safety database revealed 8 cases with a diagnosis 
of acute pancreatitis/pancreatitis. Only in 1 case of pancreatitis a relationship to midostaurin treatment was 
suspected.  Overall, in the absence of a plausible mechanism supporting a causal relationship between 
midostaurin treatment and pancreatitis, and with only 1 case of a suspected relationship, it is agreed that 
thus far the data are not indicative of a causal relationship between midostaurin and pancreatitis.

Dose modifications (interruption or adjustment) due to ADRs occurred in 31% of patients. The most frequent 
ADRs that led to dose modification (incidence ≥5%) were nausea and vomiting (SmPC, section 4.8). 
ADRs that led to treatment discontinuation occurred in 9.2% of patients. The most frequent (incidence ≥1%) 
were febrile neutropenia, nausea, vomiting and pleural effusion (SmPC, section 4.8). 
The number of patients who experienced AEs and SAEs were generally similar in patients < 60 years and 
patients ≥ 60 years. Results were similar in patients < 65 years (n=78 patients) and ≥ 65 years of age 
(n=64 patients). Also in this population an increased mortality in the elderly (>65 years) is noted.  
The frequency of SAEs, grade 3/4 AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation were higher in males. Vomiting and 
nausea were more commonly reported in females, as were tremor, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, 
urinary tract infection, flushing, and back pain. Anaemia, peripheral oedema, rash and insomnia were more 
commonly reported in males. Of note, median exposure in females was higher than in males which may 
partly explain the increased AEs seen in females. 
There were no apparent differences in AE profile in populations with different ECOG status (ECOG 0-1 vs ≥2) 
in the AML population. Among patients with normal vs those with mild hepatic impairment, apart from a 
somewhat higher frequency of SAEs in the hepatic impaired (65% vs. 78%), no major differences were 
observed in the proportion of patients with AEs, deaths, AEs leading to discontinuation or dose 
reduction/interruption. 
Safety on both indications 
Neutropenia has occurred in patients receiving Rydapt as monotherapy and in combination with 
chemotherapy. Severe neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/l) was generally reversible by withholding Rydapt until 
recovery and discontinuation in the ASM, SM-AHN and MCL studies. White blood cell counts (WBCs) should be 
monitored regularly, especially at treatment initiation. In patients who develop unexplained severe 
neutropenia, treatment with Rydapt should be interrupted until ANC is ≥1.0 x 109/l. Rydapt should be 
discontinued in patients who develop recurrent or prolonged severe neutropenia that is suspected to be 
related to Rydapt (SmPC, section 4.4).  
All AML patients in study A2301 reported leukopenia-related events and all were grade 3/4 in severity. The 
most commonly occurring were neutrophil count decreased (96.5% vs 97.8%) and febrile neutropenia 
(83.4% vs 80.5%). There was no discernible difference in the incidence of leukopenia-related events 
including neutropenia (grade 4) or in the time to resolution between midostaurin and placebo treatment 
groups. Leukopenia-related events were reported in 32 (22.5%) ASM/SM-AHN/MCL  patients. Leukopenia has 
been categorized as identified risk (see Risk Management Plan). 
Because of the observed neutropenia and leukopenia, any active serious infection should be under control 
prior to starting treatment with Rydapt monotherapy. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms 
of infection, including any device-related infections, and if a diagnosis of infection is made appropriate 
treatment must be instituted promptly, including, as needed, the discontinuation of Rydapt (SmPC, section 
4.4).  Severe infections have been categorized as identified risks (see Risk Management Plan). 
Patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure were excluded from clinical studies. In the ASM, SM-AHN 
and MCL studies cardiac dysfunction such as congestive heart failure (CHF) (including some fatalities) and 
transient decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) occurred. In the randomised AML study no 
difference in CHF was observed between the Rydapt + chemotherapy and placebo + chemotherapy arms. In 
patients at risk, Rydapt should be used with caution and the patient closely monitored by assessing LVEF

when clinically indicated (at baseline and during treatment) (SmPC, section 4.4). Cardiac dysfunction has 
been categorized as potential risk (see Risk Management Plan). 
An increased frequency of QTc prolongation was noted in midostaurin–treated patients (see section 4.8), 
however, a mechanistic explanation for this observation was not found. Caution is warranted in patients at 
risk of QTc prolongation (e.g. due to concomitant medicinal products and/or electrolyte disturbances). 
Interval assessments of QT by ECG should be considered if Rydapt is taken concurrently with medicinal 
products that can prolong QT interval (SmPC, section 4.4). 
Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, in some cases fatal, have occurred in patients treated with 
Rydapt monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy. Patients should be monitored for pulmonary 
symptoms indicative of ILD or pneumonitis and Rydapt discontinued in patients who experience pulmonary 
symptoms indicative of ILD or pneumonitis that are ≥Grade 3 (NCI CTCAE) (SmPC, section 4.4). Pulmonary 
toxicity (including pleural effusion and interstitial lung disease) has been categorized as identified risk (see 
Risk Management Plan). 
Caution is warranted when considering the administration of midostaurin in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment and patients should be carefully monitored for toxicity (SmPC, section 4.4). Use of midostaurin in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment is classified as missing information in the risk management plan. 
Caution is warranted when considering the administration of midostaurin in patients with severe renal 
impairment or end-stage renal disease and patients should be carefully monitored for toxicity (SmPC, section 
4.4). 
Rydapt contains macrogolglycerol hydroxystearate, which may cause stomach discomfort and diarrhoea. A 
100 mg dose of Rydapt contains approximately 14 vol. % ethanol anhydrous, which corresponds to 333 mg 
alcohol. This is equivalent to 8.4 ml beer or 3.5 ml wine. Alcohol may be harmful in patients with 
alcohol-related problems, epilepsy or liver problems or during pregnancy or breast-feeding (SmPC, section 
4.4). 
The safety of Rydapt in children and adolescents below 18 years has not been established (section 4.2). This 
has been adequately reflected in the SmPC and is reflected in the Risk Management Plan. 
In AML patients the incidence of any grade skin toxicities was similar in the treatment groups except for 
grade 3/4 skin toxicities which were reported at a higher incidence in the midostaurin arm than in the 
placebo arm (overall:14.0% midostaurin vs. 7.2% placebo; dermatitis exfoliative: 10.9% vs 4.1%). In 4 
patients in the midostaurin group skin toxicity was reported as an AE leading to treatment discontinuation.  
Sporadic cases of skin toxicity were observed in ASM/SM-AHN/MCL patients with 4 cases of grade 3 toxic skin 
eruption and 1 grade 2 erythema multiforme. In supportive studies skin-related events were also commonly 
reported. No case of severe or fatal skin toxicity (e.g. Stevens-Johnsons syndrome) was reported across the 
midostaurin studies. A cumulative search for photosensitivity reports in the Novartis Safety Database 
(ARGUS) with a data lock of 16-April-2017 and using the MedDRA (version 19.1) HLT "Photosensitivity and 
photodermatosis conditions" revealed a total of 11 cases. The limited data that was available suggested 
confounding by multiple co-suspect drugs known to cause photosensitivity (providing alternative causal 
factors), had an unreasonable time-to-onset making a causal relationship unlikely, or had a prior history of 
photosensitivity indicating other unknown causal factors. 
With regard to basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the review of the eight reports did not justify the addition of BCC 
to the label or the RMP considering confounding factors; two patients had prior history of BCC; one had prior 
radiotherapy, which was a more likely trigger for the reported event of Bowen’s disease. Two patients 
presented with BCC more than two years after the last dose of midostaurin, and among the remaining three

Page 189/209 
 
  
  
poorly documented cases one was not suspected to be related to midostaurin and the remaining two were 
too poorly documented to be assessed properly. 
Overall it is considered that the addition of photosensitivity or basal cell carcinoma to the label/ RMP is not 
warranted at this time. 
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increase exposure of midostaurin (see discussion on clinical pharmacology). In 
A2301, up to 62% of the patients received midostaurin concomitantly with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 in the 
induction phase. Comparison of the AE profile in the midostaurin arm of subjects known to have concomitant 
treatment with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (n=170) with that of subjects who did not (n=59), showed that the 
frequencies of grade 3/4 pneumonia, sepsis, febrile neutropenia, and infections were all increased in patients 
treated concomitantly with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Analysis, of patients who were treated and those were not 
treated with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors for both treatment arms indicated that also in the placebo group the 
frequency of infections is increased in the placebo group treated with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors when 
compared to those not receiving CYP3A4 inhibitors, albeit that the difference is a bit less than what is seen in 
the midostaurin group. Drug-drug interactions with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and drug-drug interactions with 
strong CYP3A4 inducers have been categorized as identified risks (see Risk Management Plan). 
Reported experience with overdose in humans is very limited. Single doses of up to 600 mg have been given 
with acceptable acute tolerability. Adverse reactions observed were diarrhoea, abdominal pain and vomiting. 
There is no known specific antidote for midostaurin. In the event of an overdose, patients must be closely 
monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and appropriate symptomatic and supportive 
treatment initiated (SmPC, section 4.9). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.5, dated 20 July 2017, is 
acceptable. 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 28.04.2017. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.8.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of midostaurin with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture of 
isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers midostaurin to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.

2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Rydapt (midostaurin) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The target indications are as follows: 
•  Midostaurin is indicated in combination with standard daunorubicin and cytarabine induction and high 
dose cytarabine consolidation chemotherapy and for patients in complete response followed by 
Rydapt single agent maintenance therapy for adult patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid 
leukaemia (AML) who are FLT3 mutation positive  
•  Midostaurin is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with aggressive systemic 
mastocytosis (ASM), systemic mastocytosis with associated haematological neoplasm (SM-AHN), or 
mast cell leukaemia (MCL). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
FLT3 positive AML 
Standard of care therapy of AML has not changed substantially in the past 30 years and consists of a 
combination of an anthracycline and continuous-infusion of cytarabine in the classic ‘3+7’ regimen, i.e., 3 
days of intravenous administration of an anthracycline combined with 7 days of continuous intravenous 
cytarabine as induction chemotherapy, followed by consolidation therapy with intermediate or high-dose 
cytarabine-based chemotherapy, and/or stem cell transplantation, depending on risk group. Despite the 
currently available treatment options, around 60% of adult AML patients who are 60 years of age or younger 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/516229/2017 
Page 196/209 
 
  
  
and 90% of patients who are older than 60 years of age are not cured with available treatment options. 
Therefore, there is a need for new treatment options in patients with AML. 
ASM / SM-AHN / MCL 
Patients with ASM, SM-AHN, or MCL have limited treatment options, and to date there are no approved 
therapies in the EU for ASM, SM-AHN, or MCL. However, there are several therapies available which are 
considered standard and are commonly used in clinical practice. In addition to therapies intended to control 
MC mediator-related symptoms (including histamine antagonists, corticosteroids, proton-pump inhibitors, and 
sodium cromolyn), cytoreductive therapy with either interferon-α (often considered first-line cytoreductive 
therapy in ASM/SM-AHN/MCL) or cladribine (often considered second-line cytoreductive therapy in ASM/SM-
AHN/MCL) are used in clinical practice in order to reduce symptoms and with the aim to prolong survival. 
Despite these available treatment options, response is limited to 30-60% of the patients. Patients with ASM, 
SM-AHN, or MCL have a shortened survival (median survival 3.5 years in patients with ASM, 2 years in SM-
AHN, and ~6 months in MCL), indicating that there is a need for new treatment options in patients with 
ASM/SM-AHN/MCL. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical package of midostaurin for the AML indication was primarily supported by data from a 
randomised phase III study (A2301) of induction (daunorubicin/cytarabine) and consolidation (high-dose 
cytarabine) chemotherapy + midostaurin (N=294) or placebo (N=269) in newly diagnosed patients younger 
than 60 years of age with FLT3-mutated AML. 
The main study for the ASM/SM-AHN/MCL indication was study D2201, a single arm, phase II, open-label 
study designed to determine the efficacy of 100 mg twice daily oral dosing of midostaurin administered to 
patients (N=116) with ASM or MCL with or without an AHNMD. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
FLT3 positive AML 
In study A2301 the addition of midostaurin to standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy 
significantly improved OS for the overall studied population: HR 0.774 (95%CI: 0.629-0.953, p=0.0078), 
corresponding to a relative risk reduction of 23% in favour of midostaurin. In an updated analysis of OS with 
15 months additional follow-up, the HR was 0.79 (95%CI: 0.64-0.97), p=0.011. At around 24-30 months OS 
curves reached a plateau with roughly 10% difference in survival rates between the curves. Subgroup 
analyses showed a consistent OS benefit across most investigated subgroups, including FLT3-high and low 
ITD/TKD allelic ratio with the exception of the gender subgroup. 
In terms of secondary endpoints, the median EFS was significantly longer for patients in the midostaurin arm 
compared to patients in the placebo arm (8.2 vs. 3.0 months) with a HR = 0.784 (95%CI: 0.662-0.930, 
p=0.0024). Subgroup analyses showed a consistent EFS benefit across most investigated subgroups, 
including according to gender (females: HR 0.81, 95%CI: 0.65-1.02; males: HR 0.79, 95%CI: 0.61-1.03).  
Subgroup analyses in patients with known NPM1 status showed that OS benefit from midostaurin occurred in 
all subgroups of patients according to NPM1 status: NPM1 mutated, HR 0.72 (95%CI: 0.52-1.01); NPM1 
wildtype, HR 0.74 (95%CI: 0.54-1.03). Subgroup analyses according to age on efficacy outcomes showed 
that the effect of midostaurin on CR, EFS and DFS was rather similar across the different age categories.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/516229/2017 
Page 197/209 
 
  
  
Sensitivity analyses for OS and EFS in the ITT population in which patients receiving SCT were censored 
showed a consistent treatment effect in line with the primary analysis.  
The secondary endpoint DFS was also consistent with the primary endpoint (HR 0.71, 95%CI: 0.55-0.92; 
p=0.0051) and complete response rate was numerically but not significantly higher in the midostaurin arm 
(58.9% vs. 53.5%, one sided p=0.073). 
Analyses of exposure-response relationships showed a trend towards increased risk of death with lower 
exposure to midostaurin (HR 1.18, 95%CI: 0.98-1.43, p=0.083) and a significantly increased risk of death 
with lower exposure to the metabolite CGP2221 (HR 1.37, 95%CI: 1.08-1.74, p=0.009). 
ASM / SM-AHN / MCL 
In the main study D2201, midostaurin conferred an ORR of 59.6% (95%CI: 48.6-69.8; p<0.001) assessed 
by the SSC and based on modified Valent/Cheson criteria, with 45% of the patients achieving a major 
response, and 15% of the patients achieving a partial response. There were no complete responses. 
Subgroup analyses showed similar response rates (ORR according to modified Valent/Cheson criteria) in 
patients with ASM/SM-AHN (61.6%, 95%CI: 49.5-72.8) and MCL (50%, 95%CI: 24.7-75.3). In KIT mutation 
positive patients the response rate was higher than in KIT mutation negative patients (63.0% for KIT 
positive, n=73; versus 43.8% for KIT negative or unknown, n=16 of which 2 unknown).  
Sensitivity analyses on ORR resulted in ORR values between 28% (ORR according to IWG-MRT-ECNM IWG 
criteria) and 65% (ORR in the PEP including late responders). 
The results of the overall ORR based on the most recent response criteria (IWG-MRT-ECNM criteria, 2013) 
was 28.3% (with 32/113 patients having a response of CR, PR, or CI), and 60.0%, 20.8% and 33.3%, 
respectively, in patients with ASM, SM-AHNMD, and MCL. 
Median DOR according to IWG-MRT-ECNM criteria was 36.8 months (95%CI: 20.5-NE). In addition, 
responses to midostaurin treatment were most durable among patients who achieved a CR or PR (median not 
reached, 95%CI: 27.0-NE), and were less durable in patients with ‘clinical improvement’ alone (23.5 months, 
95%CI: 10.9-36.8). Thus, the magnitude of response was correlated with duration of response.  
An ORR analysis in subgroups of patients with and without KIT mutations based on IWG-MRT-ECNM criteria 
showed that activity of midostaurin is observed in both subgroups, with an ORR of 23% (3/13) in KIT-wild 
type patients vs. 39% (38/97) in KIT-mutated patients. Overall survival was 26.8 months (95%CI: 17.6-
34.7).  OS differed between patients with KIT positive disease (33.9 months) versus KIT negative disease 
(7.8 months). 
Mast cell improvement (≥ 50%) was seen in 16/89 patients (18%). Serum tryptase reductions (>50% 
decrease relative to baseline) were seen in 58% of the patients. In 27% of the patients a best decrease in 
spleen volume of at least 35% was seen. 
A ≥ 50% decrease in TMSAS score (symptom burden) for at least 168 days was seen in 20 out of 52 patients 
in whom TMSAS score was measured (38%). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There is limited experience in patients ≥ 60 years of age. However, the preliminary findings of the supportive 
study ADE02T indicated a beneficial effect also in this population. Based on the similar disease biology 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/516229/2017 
Page 198/209 
 
  
  
between the age subgroups, the results of several post-hoc analyses of the pivotal study, the results of the 
supportive study and the safety profile of patients ≥ 60 years of age it was concluded that the observed 
survival benefit in the population of the pivotal study (<60 years of age) can be extrapolated to the ≥ 60 
years of age population. The results from on-going and planned studies will further quantify the OS benefit of 
midostaurin in midostaurin in patients ≥ 60 years of age (see discussion on clinical efficacy and section 4). 
A difference in treatment effect was observed in the pre-defined subgroups according to gender, with the 
large group of females found to have no OS benefit by addition of midostaurin to chemotherapy in study 
A2301. Although a gender difference has not consistently been observed in previous studies in newly 
diagnosed AML, study A2301 is not the first study reporting a (potential) difference in gender which 
somewhat alleviates the concern regarding the lack of internal consistency.  As it is likely that SCT has 
substantially contributed to this apparent gender effect, it is important to note that censoring for SCT 
(sensitivity analysis) in the ITT population (HR 0.75, 95%CI: 0.54 to 1.03) confirmed the observed OS 
benefit conferred by midostaurin in the overall population observed in the primary analysis (HR 0.774, 95% 
CI: 0.629 to 0.953). This, combined with the fact that for females a benefit of treatment was seen in the 
secondary endpoints EFS, CR and CIR, there is sufficient evidence of benefit and no safety signal to 
collectively outweigh the uncertainty on the effect size and concern regarding the internal consistently. In the 
SmpC it is highlighted that in a subgroup analysis, no apparent OS benefit was observed in females, 
however, a treatment benefit was observed in females in all secondary efficacy endpoints. 
The uncertainties that were identified during the assessment for the ASM / SM-AHN / MCL indication, primary 
analyses of ORR, the absence of comparative efficacy data and the initially proposed indication were 
satisfactorily addressed (see discussion on clinical efficacy).  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
FLT3 positive AML 
Gastrointestinal (GI) events were among the most commonly reported AEs (diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting 
occurred in >55% of the patients). The incidences of nausea, vomiting and stomatitis of any grade were 
slightly higher in the midostaurin group compared to placebo group (nausea: 83.4% vs 70.4%; vomiting 
60.3% vs 52.7%, stomatitis 19% vs 12% (NNA sites only). Grade 3/4 AEs occurring more frequently (>5%) 
in the midostaurin group than in the placebo group at all sites included exfoliative dermatitis (14% vs 8%) 
and device-related infections (16% vs 10%). 
Regarding haematological toxicitiy, the most frequent treatment-related grade 3/4 AEs were decreased 
platelet counts (60%), neutrophil counts (61%), haemoglobin (54%), and febrile neutropenia (44%), and 
these occurred at similar frequencies in both treatment groups. 
Approximately half of all patients experienced a SAE with similar incidences in the midostaurin and placebo 
group for most SAEs, except for grade 3/4 exfoliative dermatitis (10 vs 1 patients), grade 3/4 hypotension 
(10 vs 1 patients) and device-related infections (23 vs 13 patients) which were reported more often in the 
midostaurin group. 
QTc abnormalities were seen in both treatment arms; an increase of >30 msec was seen in 115 patients 
(44%) and 93 patients (40%) in the midostaurin and placebo arms, respectively, and an increase of >60 
msec was observed in 48 patients (18%) and 25 patients (11%) in the midostaurin and placebo arms, 
respectively. The frequency of >60 msec increase in QTc interval during the continuation phase (when 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/516229/2017 
Page 199/209 
 
  
  
midostaurin is administered as monotherapy) was 9.3% vs. 1.5%, for the midostaurin and placebo arms, 
respectively. 
A total of 36 patients died on treatment: 15 patients (4.3%) in the midostaurin group and 21 patients (6.3%) 
in the placebo group. Of these on-treatment deaths, 16 deaths were suspected to be related to study drug (9 
patients (2.6%) in the midostaurin arm and 7 patients (2.1%) in the placebo group). In the midostaurin 
treatment arm there was one case of cardiac arrest and 2 patients for whom QTc > 450 msec was recorded 
(1 patient died due to myocardial infarction, the other patient due to colitis). 
ASM / SM-AHN / MCL 
All patients had at least 1 AE of any grade regardless of causality. The most frequently reported AEs in the 
pooled dataset were those related to GI toxicity (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea), infections, and 
myelosuppression (anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia). Other frequent AEs (occurring in >25% of 
patients) were peripheral oedema, fatigue, pyrexia, and headache. The most frequent grade 3-4 AEs were 
those related to myelosuppression (anaemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia). 
AEs related to study drug were reported in 133 patients (93.7%). The most commonly occurring AEs 
suspected to be study drug-related were gastrointestinal-related (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea), and the 
majority of these were grade 1 or 2 in severity. 
In the pooled dataset, 68.3% of the patients had an SAE; the events were mostly grade 3 or 4 (62.7%). 
Infections were among the most commonly reported SAEs (pneumonia: 7%, sepsis: 7%, and urinary tract 
infection: 4.2%). GI events were reported in 23.9% of patients overall (gastrointestinal haemorrhage: 4.2%, 
upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage: 4.2%, diarrhoea: 5.6%, and vomiting: 4.2%). Haematological events 
most commonly reported were febrile neutropenia (4.9%) and anaemia (4.2%).  
In the pooled safety dataset there were 26 (18%) on-treatment deaths reported with 5 (3.5% of pooled 
population) due to cardiac disorders (2 cardiac arrest, 1 cardiac disorder, 1 heart failure and 1 congestive 
heart failure). 
Left ventricular ejection fraction was monitored for 64 patients during treatment. LVEF changes over time 
showed that around month 3 there was a decrease in the mean LVEF, and 3 patients had clear LVEF 
reductions compared to baseline: in 1 patient an LVEF of 50% decreased to 41%, in another patient 65% 
decreased to 49%, and for third patient a decrease from 60% to 45% was seen. 
The most frequent reasons for discontinuation of study drug in the ASM/SM-AHN/MCL safety pool were 
disease progression (n=50, 35%) and AEs (n=32, 23%). Death was the primary reason for discontinuation in 
9 patients (6%). Of these 9 deaths, for 6 patients death was considered to be due to adverse events. 
In study A2301, 62% of the patients received midostaurin concomitantly with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. 
Comparison of the AE profile in 214 patients known to have had concomitant treatment with a strong CYP3A4 
inhibitor with 131 patients who did not, showed that the frequencies of grade 3/4 pneumonia (15.4% vs 
9.2%), sepsis (9.3% vs 3.1%), febrile neutropenia (85.5% vs 79.4%) and infections (5.1% vs 0.8%) were 
all increased in patients treated concomitantly with CYP3A4 inhibitors. However, also in the placebo group the 
frequency of these AEs was increased in patients treated with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, indicating that 
confounding by indication resulted in the higher frequency of AEs in patients treated with strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors (albeit that the differences in frequencies of AEs in the placebo group were somewhat less than in 
the midostaurin group).

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The apparent midostaurin-related increase in QT prolongation events and in a >60ms shift from baseline QTc 
values in terms of exposure/dose-effect relationships has not been explained. QT prolongation (mainly) 
occurred in the presence of other confounding factors (concomitant medication and/or e.g. electrolyte 
imbalances). While it may be unlikely that midostaurin treatment on its own has the potential to induce QT 
prolongation, a possible contribution of midostaurin to QT prolongation in patients at risk for this event 
cannot be excluded. Therefore caution is warranted in patients at risk of QTc prolongation (e.g. due to 
concomitant medicinal products and/or electrolyte disturbances) and interval assessments of QT by ECG 
should be considered if midostaurin is taken concurrently with medicinal products that can prolong QT 
interval.  These have been adequately reflected in the SmPC (see section 4.2, 4.4, and 5.1) and are reflected 
in the Risk Management Plan. 
Data on potential drug-drug interactions was limited. Midostaurin and metabolites are mainly substrate for 
CYP3A4, and large differences in exposure to midostaurin and metabolites have been observed upon 
concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers. Based on the discussion of clinical 
consequence of the co-medication with strong 3A4 inhibitors and inducers, warnings on using inhibitors have 
been added in the SmPC, and using strong 3A4 inducers has been contra-indicated. The available PK data 
indicated that the risk of midostaurin affecting other drugs due to induction of CYP enzymes is high (including 
induction of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2B6), and is thus likely to affect the efficacy of many 
co-medications. A number of planned studies will be conducted by the applicant in order to address this 
safety concern (see Risk Management Plan).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
FLT3 positive AML 
The pivotal study convincingly demonstrated that addition of midostaurin to standard of care induction, 
consolidation chemotherapy followed by maintenance in newly diagnosed patients with FLT3 positive AML was 
associated with OS benefit, with an overall reduction in the risk of death of 23%. The higher plateau in the 
EFS and OS Kaplan-Meier curves suggested that addition of midostaurin lead to a higher proportion of the 
patients having long-term benefit. The effect of midostaurin on outcome is considered clinically relevant, and 
addition of midostaurin to chemotherapy is considered to be a therapeutic advantage compared to available 
standard of care therapy. All secondary endpoints are in support of the observed OS benefit, with a strong 
degree of statistical significance, and the treatment effect is therefore considered robustly demonstrated.  
Although the safety evaluation of midostaurin is complicated by the administration of concomitant 
chemotherapy (AML) overall, the safety profile of midostaurin is relatively well characterised.  
ASM / SM-AHN / MCL: 
In the updated ORR analysis according to the more recent and more clinically relevant IWG-MRT-ECNM 
criteriathe overall ORR was 28.3% (with 32/113 patients having a response of CR, PR, or CI), and 60.0%, 
20.8% and 33.3%, respectively, in patients with ASM, SM-AHNMD, and MCL. The magnitude of response was 
correlated with duration of response and this is considered a clinical benefit in terms of delaying worsening of 
the disease. Overall, quality of life data and OS data did not highlight any potential detriment, albeit based 
on indirect comparisons.  
Assessment report

The safety evaluation of midostaurin is complicated by the lack of a control arm (ASM/SM-AHN/MCL) and/or 
the underlying condition (ASM/SM-AHN/MCL), however, overall, the safety profile of midostaurin is relatively 
well characterised.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
FLT3 positive AML 
Given the poor prognosis of patients with AML, the treatment effect of midostaurin is considered clinically 
relevant, and has been robustly demonstrated in the overall population in the single pivotal study that was 
submitted. The safety profile of midostaurin was manageable and is acceptable in view of the therapeutic 
context and given the observed benefits. 
ASM / SM-AHN / MCL 
It is considered that the ORR analyses submitted based on IWG-MRT-ECNM criteria provided compeling 
evidence for the efficacy of midostaurin and demonstrated that midostaurin provides clinical benefit to 
patients who achieve a treatment response. The safety profile of midostaurin in ASM/SM-AHN/MCL is 
acceptable in view of the severity of the disease and the benefits observed. 
The lack of comparative data is unfortunate but understandable given the specific circumstances which 
pertain to the extreme rarity of the diseases and the great unmet medical need in systemic mastocytosis 
patients. Midostaurin conferred durable responses, and the responses were further corroborated by durable 
reductions in bone marrow mast cell burden). For other available therapies such as interferon-α and 
cladribine, the historical evidence for efficacy is much weaker and comes mostly from retrospective 
investigations (and some small single-arm studies).  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Rydapt is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Rydapt is not similar to Ceplene, Vidaza and Dacogen within 
the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Rydapt is favourable in the following indication: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/516229/2017 
Page 204/209 
 
  
  
in combination with standard daunorubicin and cytarabine induction and high-dose cytarabine 
• 
consolidation chemotherapy, and for patients in complete response followed by Rydapt single agent 
maintenance therapy, for adult patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) who are FLT3 
mutation-positive (see section 4.2); 
as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM), 
• 
systemic mastocytosis with associated haematological neoplasm (SM-AHN), or mast cell leukaemia (MCL). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product within 
6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the  agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.

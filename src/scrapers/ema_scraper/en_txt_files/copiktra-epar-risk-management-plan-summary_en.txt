Summary of risk management plan for Copiktra (duvelisib) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for COPIKTRA. The RMP details important 
risks of COPIKTRA, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about COPIKTRA's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
COPIKTRA's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how COPIKTRA should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for COPIKTRA should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of 
the European Public Assessment Report 
(https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/copiktra).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of COPIKTRA's 
RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
COPIKTRA monotherapy is authorised for adult patients with relapsed or refractory CLL after at 
least two prior therapies and FL that is refractory to at least two prior systemic therapies (see SmPC 
for the full indication). It contains duvelisib as the active substance and it is given by oral 
administration. 
Further information about the evaluation of COPIKTRA’s benefits can be found in COPIKTRA’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines Agency 
(EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks  
Important risks of COPIKTRA, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies 
for learning more about COPIKTRA's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The  medicine’s  legal  status  —  the  way  a  medicine  is  supplied  to  the  patient  (e.g.  with  or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected  continuously  and 
regularly analysed, including  periodic  safety  update report  (PSUR)  so  that  immediate  action  can  be 
taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
 
 
If important information that may affect the safe use of COPIKTRA is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  COPIKTRA  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient 
proof of a link with the use of COPIKTRA. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with 
the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established 
yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to  information  on  the  safety  of  the 
medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the 
medicine);

II.B Summary of important risks 
Important identified risk: Serious infections 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Non-clinical:  Toxicology  studies  showed  lymphoid  depletion  (both  in 
the peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues) with a functional impact like 
occurrence of secondary infections. 
Clinical  studies:  High  frequency  of  infections  was  observed.  Most 
infections  were  either  upper  or  lower  respiratory  infections,  the  latter 
being more predominant and specifically represented by Pneumonia. 
Post-marketing data: Cases were reported post-marketing. 
Class effect: Zydelig: High frequency of infections was observed. Most 
frequently observed were infections in the respiratory system and septic 
events. 
Infections 
in  patients  with 
haematological  malignancies.  These  patients  are  at  increased  risk  of 
infections not only because of the malignancy itself but also because of 
neutropenia induced by intensive chemotherapeutic treatment that may 
be  followed  by  haematopoietic  stem  cell  transplantation,  and  the 
cytotoxic effect on the cells that line the alimentary tract. There are often 
multiple factors that predispose patients with haematological diseases to 
infections  such  as  neutropenia  induced  therapy  or  bone  marrow 
involvement, hypogammaglobulinemia, T-cell dysfunction, asplenia and 
mucosal damage.

Clinical studies: High frequency of diarrhoea and colitis was observed. 
Post-marketing data: Cases were reported post-marketing. 
Class effect: Zydelig: Cases of severe drug-related colitis occurred. 
Patients with haematologic disease are susceptible to CDAD because of 
their frequent antibiotic use, prolonged duration of hospital stay, and 
chemotherapy-induced disruption of the intestinal mucosa. Prophylactic 
and empirical use of broad spectrum antibiotics is the common 
treatment for neutropenic fever patients with haematologic disease. A 
higher incidence of Grade ≥3 toxicities was found in younger patients 
with higher absolute lymphocyte counts. Preliminary data from ongoing 
studies suggest that patients with severe toxicities had lower baseline 
levels of Treg functional markers and decreased Treg effector markers 
(granzyme β, HLA-D related, and programmed cell death-1) after 
treatment relative to those who do not. Although these observations 
require confirmation, baseline Treg profiling may be a potential method 
for prospectively identifying patients at greatest risk for toxicity.

Clinical studies: High frequency of cutaneous reactions was observed. 
Post-marketing data: Cases were reported post-marketing. 
Class effect: Zydelig: Rash was generally mild to moderate and typically 
resolved  with 
steroids, 
diphenhydramine) and dose interruption for severe cases. 
Rarely, cases of SJS and TEN have occurred when idelalisib was 
administered concomitantly with other medicinal products associated 
with these syndromes (bendamustine, rituximab, allopurinol, and 
amoxicillin). SJS or TEN occurred within one month of the medicinal 
combination and fatal outcomes have resulted. 
A genetic disposition to cutaneous adverse drug reactions has long been 
assumed. Nevertheless, specific reaction types in relation to certain drugs 
could  only  recently  be  determined  for  patients  with  specific  HLA 
patterns, which vary according to ethnicity. For example, HLA-A*3101 
was  shown  to  be  present  in  European  patients  with  carbamazepine-
induced  adverse  reactions,  particularly  maculopapular  rash,  but  not  in 
severe  reactions  like  SJS/TEN.  A  very  strong  association  between 
carbamazepine-induced  SJS/TEN  in  Han-Chinese  patients  and  HLA-
B*1502 was observed which could not be confirmed in Europeans. HLA-
B*5801 was found in Han-Chinese patients with SJS/TEN and DRESS 
after allupurinol intake (100%), as well as in Europeans with SJS/TEN 
 
 
Risk minimisation measures 
(55%). These results clearly show that first, the genetic predisposition for 
the  development  of  severe  cutaneous  adverse  reactions  is  highly 
associated with specific drugs, and that second, ethnicity plays a more 
important role than expected.  
HIV individuals are at an increased risk of hypersensitivity reaction to 
certain drugs such as sulfonamides and nevirapine. Furthermore, 
hypersensitivity reaction to nevirapine reaction is CD4 dependent and is 
abrogated by a CD4 count of <250.

Clinical studies: Non-Infectious Pneumonitis cases were observed. 
Post-marketing data: Cases were reported post-marketing. 
Class effect: Zydelig: Cases of pneumonitis and organising pneumonia 
(some with fatal outcome), have been reported with idelalisib. 
Preliminary data from ongoing studies suggest that patients with severe 
toxicities had lower baseline levels of Treg functional markers and 
decreased Treg effector markers (granzyme β, HLA-D related, and 
programmed cell death-1) after treatment relative to those who do not. 
Although these observations require confirmation, baseline Treg 
profiling may be a potential method for prospectively identifying 
patients at greatest risk for toxicity. In addition, patients exposed to 
harsh chemicals or irritants, moulds and bacteria, as well as radiation 
treatment, may be more susceptible.

Clinical studies: There were a few cases of hepatoxicity and none were

Post-marketing data: Cases were reported post-marketing. 
Class effect: Zydelig: There have been reports of hepatocellular injury 
including hepatic failure.  
Preliminary data from ongoing studies suggest that patients with severe 
toxicities had lower baseline levels of Treg functional markers and 
decreased Treg effector markers (granzyme β, HLA-D related, and 
programmed cell death-1) after treatment relative to those who do not. 
Although these observations require confirmation, baseline Treg 
profiling may be a potential method for prospectively identifying 
patients at greatest risk for toxicity. Hepatotoxicity was more prevalent 
in younger, previously untreated patients. In addition, risk factors for 
drug-induced liver injury include race, age, sex, alcohol ingestion, pre-
existing liver disease, genetic factors, other comorbidities, drug 
formulation and host factors.

Non-clinical: Duvelisib and its metabolite are strong inhibitors of 
CYP3A4. 
Clinical studies:  Co-administration of duvelisib and midazolam, a 
sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, in healthy adults, increased the midazolam 
AUC by 4.3-fold and Cmax by 2.2-fold. Pharmacokinetic simulations in 
cancer patients under steady state conditions have shown that the Cmax 
and AUC of midazolam would increase by 2.5-fold and 5.9-fold 
respectively.  
Class effect: Zydelig is a strong CYP3A inhibitor that can increase the 
AUC of a sensitive CYP3A substrates.

Summary of risk management plan for LEMTRADA (Alemtuzumab) 
This is a summary of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for LEMTRADA. The RMP details 
important risks of LEMTRADA how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will 
be obtained about LEMTRADA’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
LEMTRADA's Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and its Package Leaflet (PL) give 
essential information to healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients on how LEMTRADA should 
be used. 
This summary of the RMP for LEMTRADA should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part 
of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
LEMTRADA’s RMP. 
I. 
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR  
LEMTRADA is indicated as a single disease modifying therapy (DMT) in adults with highly active 
relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) (see SmPC for the full indication) for the following 
patient group: 
  Patients with highly active disease despite a full and adequate course of treatment with at 
least one DMT or; 
  Patients with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or 
more disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on 
brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or a significant increase in T2 lesion load as 
compared to a previous recent MRI. 
It contains alemtuzumab as the active substance and it is given by intravenous (IV) infusion. 
Further information about the evaluation of LEMTRADA’s benefits can be found in 
LEMTRADA’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European 
Medicines Agency (EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/lemtrada 
II. 
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO MINIMIZE OR 
FURTHER CHARACTERIZE THE RISKS  
Important risks of LEMTRADA, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about LEMTRADA's risks, are outlined in the next sections.  
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and HCPs; 
 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
  The authorized pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
  The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In the case of LEMTRADA, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimization 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, outlined in the next sections. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analyzed, including Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) assessment so that immediate 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of LEMTRADA is not yet available, it is listed 
under “missing information” outlined in the next section. 
II.A 
List of important risks and missing information  
Important risks of LEMTRADA are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered or taken. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of LEMTRADA. Potential risks are concerns for 
which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine);

Risk factors and risk 
groups  
Clinical studies and postmarketing 
Infusion-associated reactions are commonly reported with monoclonal antibody 
administration a and were observed in approximately 90% of patients treated with 
alemtuzumab in MS clinical trials. A higher than recommended dose and faster infusion rate 
also increase the risk of IAR. There is no identified pattern in terms of additive or synergistic 
factors. 
While Infusion-associated reactions have also been observed with use of alemtuzumab in 
B-CLL, reporting rates are different than those in MS patients, and AEs tend to be more 
severe in the B-CLL population. The recommended dosing regimens for B-CLL patients is 
10-fold higher than for MS patients: B-CLL patients are dosed chronically for up to 3 months, 
compared to 2 annual courses for MS patients (5 days at month 0, 3 days at month 12). 
Alemtuzumab treatment is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to alemtuzumab or 
its excipients.

Postmarketing 
There were no non-clinical findings suggestive of stroke in repeat-dose toxicity studies with 
alemtuzumab. 
The major risk factors for stroke include: 
  High BP 
  Diabetes 
  Smoking 
  Heart disease 
  Personal or family History of stroke or TIA 
  Brain aneurysms or AVMs 
  It is not clearly identified which patients are at risk of stroke with LEMTRADA use. 
However, significantly increased BP during infusion may be a risk factor for haemorrhagic 
stroke, and vital sign should be monitored prior to and during infusion as described in the 
SmPC. 
  The reported events followed no particular pattern in terms of risk groups. There was no 
dose related pattern. The majority of stroke cases temporally associated to LEMTRADA 
infusion occurred within 3 days of LEMTRADA administration. No pattern of additive or 
synergistic factors were observed.

There were no non-clinical findings suggestive of vascular dissection in repeat-dose toxicity 
studies with alemtuzumab. 
Dissection of the cervicocephalic arteries are typically associated with “minor” cervical 
trauma, or torsion of the neck including variety of everyday activities. All of the reported 
events of arterial dissection appear to be in the extracranial compartment, adjacent to bony 
structures, which is where traumatic dissection typically occurs. Of the reported cases, there 
were 3 cases reported with regular chiropractic manipulations. 
There was no dose related pattern.

Clinical studies and postmarketing 
In clinical trials, over all available follow-up of the 1486a alemtuzumab treated patients, 
1466 had anti-TPO antibody testing at baseline. Patients with positive anti-TPO antibodies at 
baseline also had a higher incidence of abnormal TSH result with simultaneous abnormal T3 
or T4 compared to patients with negative antibodies. Of the 1466 patients with anti TPO 
testing at baseline, 91.4% tested negative and 8.6% tested positive. Of those who tested 
negative, 38.2% developed a thyroid AE. Of those who tested positive, 74.8% developed a 
thyroid AE. Thus, there is a higher risk of developing a thyroid AE in anti-TPO positive 
patients. However, of the patients with baseline anti-TPO antibody testing who developed a 
thyroid AE, 86% had tested negative for anti-TPO antibodies which underlines the poor 
predictive value of the measure as a whole. Had anti-TPO positive status been an exclusion 
to alemtuzumab therapy, only a small number of patients (80 out of 1466, 5.4%) would have 
been spared a thyroid AE but, based on the lower efficacy observed in the control group, 
some of them would have experienced additional MS relapses and disability progression that 
were avoided with alemtuzumab treatment. 
Maternal transmission of anti-TSH receptor antibodies is associated with higher maternal 
titres of anti-TSH receptor antibodies in the third trimester. 
There was no dose related pattern. No pattern of additive or synergistic factors were 
observed.

Evidence for linking

Risk factors and risk 
groups  
Clinical studies and postmarketing 
Relapsing remitting MS patients who have been previously treated with immune suppressive 
agents are theoretically at increased risk for infection if subsequently treated with 
alemtuzumab, as concomitant use of alemtuzumab with any of these therapies could increase 
the risk of immunosuppression. 
In controlled clinical trials, the rate of infections and serious infections is greater in previously 
treated patients, regardless of treatment (ie, whether alemtuzumab-treated or interferon 
treated). 
Interim safety data from CAMMS223 suggested that MS patients treated with alemtuzumab 
were at an increased risk of developing HSV within 1 month of receiving alemtuzumab. a  
Additionally, patients with mobility restrictions may theoretically be at higher risk for infectious 
complications due to diminished mobility and functional capacity (eg, aspiration pneumonia, 
infected decubitus ulcers, presence of indwelling catheter, and dysphagia with aspiration). 
There was no dose related pattern identified in the reported cases. No pattern of additive or 
synergistic factors were observed.

Risk minimization 
measures 
Routine risk minimization measures:  
  Labeled in sections 4.2 and 5.2 of SmPC. 
  LEMTRADA treatment should be initiated and supervised by a neurologist experienced in 
the treatment of patients with MS in a hospital with ready access to intensive care. 
Specialists and equipment required for the timely diagnosis and management of adverse 
reactions, especially myocardial ischaemia and MI, cerebrovascular adverse reactions, 
autoimmune conditions, and infections, should be available. Resources for the 
management of cytokine release syndrome, hypersensitivity and/or anaphylactic 
reactions should be available.

The following studies are conditions of the marketing authorization: 
Table 25 - Studies which are conditions of the marketing authorization  
A non-interventional PASS to investigate drug utilization and safety monitoring patterns for 
LEMTRADA (alemtuzumab) 
Purpose of the study: 
LEMTRADA was subject to an EMA Article 20 referral (EMEA/H/A-31/1483/C/3718/0028) initiated in 2019, following 
findings of serious safety concerns from post-marketing data. During the procedure, new and cumulative safety data were 
assessed. Subsequently, changes to the EU-SmPC label were implemented. The indication has been revised and 
additional safety information has been included under “Contraindications” and “Special warnings and precautions for use” 
sections of the EU-SmPC. The primary objectives of this study are to measure the proportion of prescribed LEMTRADA 
patients who  
  have the newly revised indication and;  
  do not have any of the revised contraindications at the time of prescribing.  
The secondary objective will focus on measuring adherence to the safety monitoring, prior to and during LEMTRADA 
infusion along with long-term safety monitoring. 
A non-interventional PASS to investigate the risk of mortality in MS patients treated with 
alemtuzumab (LEMTRADA) relative to comparable MS patients using other DMTs 
Purpose of the study: 
Following an EMA Article 20 referral (EMEA/H/A-31/1483/C/3718/0028) in 2019, an investigation into the risk of mortality in 
MS patients treated with LEMTRADA compared to a relevant MS patient population is required for years during which 
LEMTRADA has been in use. 
Research objective/question: To ascertain whether MS patients treated with LEMTRADA have a higher risk of all-cause 
mortality than comparable MS patients treated with other HE-DMT.

 Table 26 - Other studies in post-authorization development plan 
PASS OBS13434: A prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study of patients with 
relapsing forms of MS Treated with LEMTRADA (alemtuzumab) (cat. 3) 
Purpose of the study: 
To better characterize the long-term safety profile of alemtuzumab in relapsing MS patients and to determine the incidence 
of adverse events of special interest. In addition, the following safety concerns: thrombocytopenia and use in 
patients >55 years. 
Pediatric Study EFC13429: Open-label, rater-blinded, single-arm, before and after efficacy, 
safety and tolerability study of alemtuzumab in pediatric patients from 10 years to less than 
18 years with RRMS with disease activity on prior disease modifying treatment (cat. 3) 
Purpose of the study: 
To evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of alemtuzumab (IV) before and after treatment in pediatric subjects with 
relapsing forms of MS, who have disease activity on prior therapy. 
IV: Intravenous; MS: Multiple Sclerosis; PASS: Post-Authorization Safety Study; RRMS: Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis.

1.  Introduction 
On 29th June 2020, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Prevenar 13, in accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that a phase 4, randomised, open-label trial to describe the safety, tolerability, and 
immunogenicity of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine formulated in multidose vials when 
given with routine paediatric vaccines in healthy infants in India, protocol B4671004 is a stand-alone 
study. 
The current EU-approved indications for the use of Prevenar 13 are: 
•  Active immunisation for the prevention of invasive disease, pneumonia and acute otitis media 
caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in infants, children and adolescents from 6 weeks to 17 
years of age; 
•  Active immunisation for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia caused by 
Streptococcus pneumoniae in adults ≥ 18 years of age and the elderly 
The 4 dose multidose vial (MDV) with a new formulation of Prevenar 13 containing the additional 
preservative 2-phenoxyethanol (2-PE) was submitted to the European Medicines Agency(EMA) as a 
grouped Type II variation  (EMEA/H/C/001104/II/0130/G) on the 11 November 2015 and received a 
positive Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) Opinion on the 01 April 2016. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Suspension for Injection, 1 dose (0.5 mL) contains Streptococcus pneumoniae saccharides conjugated 
to diphtheria CRM197 protein: 
Serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F ......................... 2.2 μg  
Serotype 6B ............................................................................................4.4 μg 
The vaccine is formulated with 5mM succinate buffer, 0.02% polysorbate 80, and 0.125mg of 
aluminium as aluminium phosphate, per 0.5-mL dose. 13vPnC multidose vials (MDVs) will also contain 
4 mg of 2-PE per 0.5-mL dose.  
For this study, the investigational products are 13vPnC with 2-PE in multidose vials (MDVs) and 
13vPnC without 2-PE in prefilled syringes (PFSs). Four (4) doses of 13vPnC (2.0 mL) will be contained 
within each MDV. For the purposes of this study, only a single 0.5-mL dose will be administered from 
each of the MDVs.

paediatric vaccines in healthy infants in India, Protocol B4671004. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
A Phase 4, Randomized, Open-Label Trial to Describe the Safety, 
Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of 13-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate 
Vaccine Formulated in Multidose Vials When Given with Routine Pediatric 
Vaccines in Healthy Infants in India, Protocol B4671004 
Description 
Diseases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae are a public health problem affecting all age groups 
worldwide. Pneumonia, febrile bacteraemia, and meningitis are the most common manifestations of 
invasive pneumonia disease (IPD). Pneumococcal meningitis is a severe disease with high mortality 
and high incidence of neurologic sequelae. S pneumoniae also causes non-invasive pneumococcal 
disease, including otitis media, sinusitis, bronchitis, and nonbacteraemic pneumonia. Of the estimated 
8.8 million global annual deaths among children <5 years of age in 2008, the WHO estimated that 
476,000 (333,000 to 529,000) were caused by pneumococcal infections. Disease rates and mortality 
are higher in developing regions than in industrialized regions, with the majority of deaths occurring in 
Africa and Asia. 
The preservative, 2-PE, added to 13vPnC in MDVs is a phenolic derivative used in vaccine production. 
It was studied at high concentrations in animal studies and did not result in adverse effects (AEs). 
Furthermore, a study published by Khandke et al demonstrated that 2-PE at 5.0 mg per dose in the 
Prevenar 13 multidose formulation met the antimicrobial effectiveness requirements of the European 
Pharmacopoeia. Currently, 2-PE is the preservative used in a number of commercially available 
vaccines, e.g., diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine adsorbed (Daptacel; 
Infanrix) and hepatitis A inactivated and hepatitis B (recombinant) vaccine (Twinrix). In the earlier 
open-label, randomized study (B4671001) in healthy infants in the Gambia, the 13vPnC MDV 
formulation with 2-PE as preservative demonstrated immunogenicity and safety profiles comparable to 
those of the approved formulation of 13vPnC without 2-PE (provided in PFSs). 
Prevenar 13 and the MDV 13vPnC+2-PE formulation are licensed in India for active immunization for 
the prevention of disease caused by S pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 
19F, and 23F (including sepsis, meningitis, bacteraemia, pneumonia, and acute otitis media) in infants 
and children from 6 weeks to 5 years of age. Prevenar 13 is also licensed in India for active 
immunization for the prevention of pneumonia and invasive disease caused by S pneumoniae 
serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F in children of 6 years to 17 years of 
age and adults 50 years of age and older. 
This clinical study report (CSR) describes the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 13vPnC with 
2-PE presented in MDVs in infants and toddlers in India. This study is defined as a post-authorisation 
safety study (PASS).

Study design 
This was a randomised, multi-centre and open-label phase 4 study. The subjects were randomised in a 
1:1 ratio to receive either 13vPnC with 2-PE from an MDV or 13vPnC without 2-PE in a PFS. Subjects 
were allocated to vaccine groups through the use of an interactive web-based response system. 
Approximately 300 subjects (150 subjects per group) at 7 sites were randomized. The subjects were 
vaccinated in a 3-dose infant series at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age followed by a toddler dose at 12 
months of age. Subjects had 2 blood draws of up to 5 mL approximately 1 month after the infant 
series and approximately 1 month after the toddler dose. The approximate duration of the study was 
20 months, assuming a 6-month recruitment period. 
Study population /Sample size 
Approximately 300 Indian boys and girls (150 subjects per group) who were vaccinated in a 3-dose 
infant series at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age followed by a toddler dose at 12 months of age. 
Treatments 
At Visits 1, 2, 3, and 5, all subjects were administered 13vPnC (MDV or PFS) intramuscularly by 
injecting 0.5 mL into the left anterolateral thigh muscle. Concomitant vaccines were given in a different 
limb from that used to administer 13vPnC. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
As reflected in Table 1 above. 
Safety evaluations 
Local reactions (i.e., redness, swelling, and pain) at the 13vPnC injection site were monitored for the 
first 7 days (Days 1 to 7) following vaccination. Local reactions were measured in caliper units (range: 
1 to 14) and recorded in the e-diary. 
The e-diary was used also to record the presence of systemic events (i.e., loss of or decreased 
appetite, increased sleep, and irritability) daily for 7 days (Days 1 to 7) after each vaccination using 
the grading scale. A digital thermometer was given to the subject’s parent(s)/legal guardian(s) with 
instructions on how to measure the child’s axillary temperature at home. Axillary temperature was 
collected at evening bedtime daily for 7 days (Days 1 to 7) after each vaccination, and at any time 
during the 7 days if fever was suspected. The highest temperature for each day was recorded in the e-
diary. Fever was defined as a temperature of ≥38.0°C. Temperature was recorded to 1 decimal place 
and then categorized according to the scale for fever. 
AEs, including serious adverse effects (SAEs)  were recorded on the AE page(s) of the case report form 
(CRF) from the time the subject/ parent(s)/ legal guardian(s) provided informed consent through and 
including Visit 6 (28 to 42 Days After Visit 5).

Immunogenicity Evaluations 
Blood samples were obtained from all subjects 1 month after the infant series and 1 month after the 
toddler dose of 13vPnC. A high-throughput, multiplex direct Luminex-based immunoassay (dLIA) was 
performed on these samples to measure the concentration of antibodies elicited by the 13 
pneumococcal serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F present in the vaccine. 
Pfizer’s 13-plex dLIA was validated using immunized human serum that contained IgG antibodies to 
the 13 serotypes in 13vPnC. 
Serotype-specific OPA assays for the 13 pneumococcal serotypes were performed on blood samples 
taken from all subjects 1 month after the infant series and 1 month after the toddler dose of 13vPnC, 
where sufficient sera were available. 
Statistical Methods 
Evaluable Immunogenicity Population:  
The evaluable immunogenicity population was defined for the 3-dose infant series and the toddler dose 
separately.  
The infant evaluable immunogenicity population included all subjects who: 
•  met all eligibility criteria 
•  were aged 6 weeks (42 to 72 days, inclusive) at the time of the first vaccination 
• 
• 
• 
had received 3 doses of vaccine that was randomly assigned to them 
had post–Dose 3 blood drawn within 27 to 49 days, inclusive, after the third vaccination 
had at least 1 valid and determinate post–Dose 3 assay result, and had no other major 
protocol violations 
The toddler evaluable immunogenicity population included all subjects who:  
• 
• 
• 
had received 3 doses in the infant series and 1 toddler dose of randomly assigned vaccine  
had post–Dose 4 blood drawn within 27 to 49 days, inclusive, after the fourth vaccination 
had at least 1 valid and determinate post–Dose 4 assay result, and had no other major 
protocol violations. 
The infant and toddler evaluable immunogenicity populations were primary immunogenicity 
populations for the infant and toddler analyses. 
All- Available Immunogenicity Populations: 
The all-available immunogenicity population were defined for the 3-dose infant series and the toddler 
dose separately.  The infant all-available immunogenicity population included all subjects who had at 
least 1 valid and determinate assay result after Dose 3.  The toddler all-available immunogenicity 
population included all subjects who had at least 1valid and determinate assay result after Dose 4.

Safety Analysis Populations:  
Separate safety populations were defined for the infant series and the toddler dose.  Each safety 
population included all subjects who received at least 1dose of the investigational product for the 
indicated regimen. 
Analysis of Demographic Characteristics:  
The demographic characteristics that will be summarized using descriptive statistics include sex, 
ethnicity, and age at each vaccination. 
Efficacy Analysis: 
The proportions of subjects with IgG ≥the defined threshold was accompanied by 2-sided 95% 
confidence of intervals (CIs).  The Clopper-Pearson method was used. GMCs were obtained by log 
transformation of concentrations, averaging the transformed values, then exponentiating the results.  
95% confidence was obtained for CIs.  The CIs were calculated in the log scale with reference to the 
appropriate t-distribution. Then the lower and upper limits were exponentiated. Empirical reverse 
cumulative distribution curves (RCDCs) were compiled for each serotype at each blood sampling time 
point. Two (2)-sided 95% CIs comparing the 2 vaccine groups were compiled in order to quantify the 
differences between the 2 vaccine groups.  For the proportions of subjects with IgG ≥the defined 
threshold for each of the pneumococcal serotypes measured, the 2-sided 95% CI on MDV minus PFS 
were compiled. For the GMC, the 2-sided 95% CI on MDV minus PFS were compiled, using the log 
concentrations, as a 2-sample CI on the difference between means. The t-distribution was used.  The 
lower and upper limits were exponentiated, so the results described the ratio of MDV to PFS. Assay 
results below the limit of quantification were set to the limit of detection before analysis.  Missing data 
will not be replaced or imputed. 
Safety Analysis: 
Local injection site reactions, systemic events, and AEs were summarized by vaccine group and by 
vaccination. 
The proportions of subjects with local reactions at the injection site and systemic events reported on 
any day within the 7-day period after each vaccination were estimated for each vaccine group.  Local 
reactions were not compiled for concurrent vaccinations. 
Local reactions and systemic events that persist beyond Day 7 were listed in the CSR. AEs were 
categorized according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  AEs within 1 
month after vaccination were summarized by vaccine group for each vaccination separately.  AEs were 
also summarized from the first dose up to 1 month after the infant series. SAEs were summarized from 
the first dose up to 1 month after the toddler dose. Newly diagnosed chronic medical conditions were 
summarized from 1 month after the infant series up to the toddler dose. All safety analyses were 
performed on the safety population.  Subjects were assigned to the vaccine actually received.   
Assessors comment: We endorse MAH study design and chosen methods.

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 301 participants were randomized with 151 participants in the MDV group and 150 
participants in the PFS group.  The majority of participants completed the blood draws after the third 
dose of the infant series (18 -week visit,285 [94.7%] ) and after the toddler dose (13-month visit, 276 
[91.7%]). The percentages of participants were similar in the 2 groups for all the categories in the 
disposition table. One participant in the MDV group was withdrawn prior to vaccination.  Seven 
participants in the MDV group and 8 in the PFS group were withdrawn before the blood draw at the 18-
week visit (Visit 4).  In addition, 4 participants in the MDV group and 3 participants in the PFS group 
were withdrawn between the 18-week blood draw and the toddler dose (Vaccination 4, Visit 5).  
Reasons for withdrawal before Visit 5 included AEs (0 participants MDV; 2 participants PFS), lost to 
follow-up (2 participants MDV; 1 participant PFS), no longer meets eligibility criteria (1 participant 
MDV, 0 participants PFS), and withdrawal by parent/guardian (8 participants MDV; 8 participants PFS).  
During the toddler dose, 1 participant each was withdrawn from the MDV and PFS groups by the 
parent/guardian. 
Baseline data 
The demographical characteristics were well balanced between study arms.

Immunogenicity conclusions 
Results were generally comparable in the MDV and PFS groups for all immunogenicity endpoints as 
measured 1 month after the infant series of 13vPnC. Results were similar for the MDV and PFS groups 
as measured 1 month also after the toddler dose and, as expected, there was a clear boosting of the 
immune response induced by 13vPnC.  
Assessor’s comment: We endorse MAH conclusions. After the toddler dose close to 100 % of children 
responded with protective antibody levels for all serotypes regardless which vaccine vial type 
(multidose with 2-PE preservative or single shot vial without 2-PE) was used. This indicates that 2-PE 
do not affect immunogenicity of Prevenar 13. 
Safety results 
Local reactions 
The proportions of subjects reporting local reactions were similar for the MDV and PFS groups.  The 
most frequent local reaction reported was pain at injection site, and most local reactions were mild or 
moderate in severity.  The median durations of redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site were ≤2 
days following each dose of the infant series and 1 day following the toddler dose.  Durations were 
similar for the MDV and PFS groups.  Reported local reactions by day were similar for the MDV and PFS 
groups.

Systemic events  
The proportions of subjects reporting systemic events were similar for the MDV and PFS groups.  For 
the infant series, the most frequent systemic events reported were increased sleep and irritability.  For 
the toddler dose, the most frequent systemic event reported was irritability.  Most systemic events 
were mild or moderate in severity for both the infant series and the toddler dose.  The median 
durations of fever, decreased appetite, increased sleep, and irritability, were ≤2 days following each 
dose of the infant series and ≤3 days following the toddler dose.  Durations were similar for the MDV 
and PFS groups.

Adverse Events 
The incidence of AEs, SAEs, and related AEs was similar in the MDV and PFS groups.  The total 
incidence of any event was 71 (47.3%) in the MDV group and 74 (49.3%) in the PFS group from the 
first vaccination until 1 month after the infant series. The total incidence of any event was 11 (7.9%) 
in the MDV group and 12 (8.6%) in the PFS group from the toddler dose until 1month after the toddler 
dose.  No newly diagnosed chronical medical conditions (NDCMCs) were reported in either group. The 
distribution of AEs by system organ class and preferred term was similar in the MDV and PFS groups 
from the first vaccination until 1 month after the infant series and from the toddler dose until 1 month 
after the toddler dose.  During the infant series, the most frequently reported AE by preferred term 
was injection site pain in both groups (44 [29.3%] in the MDV and 46 [30.7%] in the PFS groups). 
These reactions were local in nature. Injection site swelling and upper respiratory tract infection were 
also frequently reported.  After the toddler dose, the most frequently reported AE by preferred term 
was upper respiratory tract infection (5 [3.6%] in the MDV and 2 [1.4%] in the PFS groups).  
Two subjects, both in the PFS group, had AEs that led to withdrawal from the study; urinary tract 
infection and vesicoureteric reflux was reported for 1 subject and seizure was reported for the other 
subject.  One participant was withdrawn prior to vaccination due to an AE.  None of the AEs leading to 
withdrawal were assessed as related to the investigational product by the investigator. 
The incidence of SAEs was similar between the MDV and PFS groups.  From the first vaccination until 1 
month after the infant series, SAEs were reported by 5 (3.3%) participants in the MDV group and 4 
(2.7%) participants in the PFS group.  From 1 month after the infant series until the toddler dose, 
SAEs were reported by 6 (4.0%) participants in the MDV group and 3 (2.0%) participants in the PFS 
group.  From the toddler dose until 1 month after the toddler dose, SAEs were reported by 1 (0.7%) 
participants in the MDV group and no participants in the PFS group.  One SAE was considered related 
to the investigational product by the investigator, a Grade 1 seizure occurring on the day of 
Vaccination 1 for a participant in the PFS group.

There were no deaths or NDCMCs reported during the study. Of the SAEs reported during the study 
period (14 in MDV group and 9 in PFS group), only 1 SAE was considered related to the investigational 
product by the investigator (seizure, PFS group). Two participants in the PFS group were withdrawn 
from the study for AEs assessed as unrelated to the investigational product (seizure, urinary tract 
infection and vesicoureteric reflux). One participant in the MDV group was withdrawn prior to 
vaccination due to an AE. 
Assessors comment: We endorse MAH conclusions. Addition of 2-PE to the vaccine did not affect the 
safety of Prevenar 13. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Present study confirmed immunogenicity and safety of Prevenar 13 MDV formulation among Indian 
infants and toddlers at age 6 weeks-12 month. Immunogenicity of 13vPnC was comparable for the 
MDV and PFS groups as measured 1 month after the infant series and 1 month after the toddler dose. 
The immunogenicity results are in agreement with previously reported studies.  
The administration of 13vPnC in both MDV and PFS was well tolerated. The safety profile of 13vPnC in 
a MDV was similar to a PFS and consistent with prior studies. The study population was small (N= 300) 
and therefore the chance to detect rare AEs and SAEs is low. No new efficacy or safety concern is 
raised from this study. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
The results of this study indicate no new safety or efficacy concern. The P46 procedure is considered 
fulfilled.  
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

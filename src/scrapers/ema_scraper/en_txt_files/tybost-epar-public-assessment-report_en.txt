2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
There are approximately 33 million people worldwide living with HIV-1. HIV-1 infection remains 
is a life-threatening disease in infected persons who do not receive adequate treatment 
sufficiently early in the course of the infection and/or are infected with virus that is resistant to 
anti-retroviral agents of several classes such that an adequate treatment regimen cannot be 
constructed from approved agents. 
Therapeutic strategies for the treatment of HIV-1 disease have been significantly advanced by 
the availability of highly active antiretroviral (ARV) therapy (HAART). The introduction of HAART 
was associated with a dramatic decrease in AIDS-related mortality and morbidity in the US and 
Europe. The goal of ARV therapy for HIV-1 infection is to delay disease progression and prolong 
survival by achieving maximal and durable suppression of HIV-1 replication.  
Current treatment guidelines suggest that initial therapy for ARV treatment-naive HIV-1 
infected patients should consist of 2 NRTIs/NtRTIs and either an NNRTI, a boosted protease 
inhibitor (PI) (e.g. darunavir, atazanavir) or the integrase inhibitor (INSTI) raltegravir (RAL). 
Boosted PIs are also used in treatment-experienced subjects infected with susceptible virus. 
Advantages of PI-based regimens include excellent anti-viral activity, a relatively high barrier 
for development of drug resistance and sparing treatment with NNRTIs. However, PIs have the 
potential for multiple drug interactions and may be associated with metabolic complications 
such as dyslipidaemia, lipodystrophy and insulin resistance. In addition, they require co-
administration of low-dose ritonavir (PI/r) to boost exposure through inhibition of CYP3A-
mediated metabolism. Indeed, systemic exposure of PIs can be increased by co-administration 
of low-dose ritonavir (RTV). This pharmacokinetic boosting effect of RTV is achieved through 
the inhibition of drug metabolism mediated by cytochrome P450 3A enzymes (CYP3A). 
Consequently, RTV has been widely used at sub-therapeutic doses in combination with many 
PIs. Of note, RTV itself is an active HIV PI with potent anti-retroviral effect. 
About the product 
The applicant has developed Cobicistat (COBI, CO) as a pharmaco-enhancer for in HIV-infected 
subjects with either once daily darunavir (DRV 800 mg) or once daily atazanavir (ATV 300 mg). 
COBI was intended as an alternative to low dose RTV to achieve pharmaco-enhancement of the 
plasma profiles of DRV or ATV. 
ATV (Reyataz) and DRV (Prezista) are both indicated in the European Union (EU) for 
coadministration with low-dose RTV for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and some 
subsets of the paediatric population. 
Of note, COBI has recently been authorised in the European Union for the fixed drug 
combination (FDC) Stribild (QUAD; also referred as single tablet regimen STR) which contains 
three ARVs (emtricitabine [FTC] and tenofovir disoproxil as fumarate [TDF] and elvitegravir 
Assessment report  
Page 9/86 
 
  
  
 
[EVG; an INSTI]) plus COBI which in this FDC modifies the pharmacokinetic profile of EVG. 
Reports of clinical studies with the Quad STR were also presented in this dossier since these 
provide additional supportive data on the long-term safety of COBI when used as a 
pharmacoenhancer in patients with HIV-1 infection. 
Initial proposed indication for use: 
Tybost is indicated as a pharmacokinetic enhancer of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV 
1) protease inhibitors atazanavir and darunavir in adults.  
Initial proposed posology: 
150 mg COBI co-administered with atazanavir or darunavir, taken orally, once daily with food. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Tybost is a film-coated tablet containing a new active substance not previously authorised in 
the EU at the time of the submission of this application. 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets, containing 150 mg of cobicistat. Other 
ingredients are: microcrystalline cellulose, silicon dioxide,  croscarmellose sodium , magnesium 
stearate, sunset yellow FCF (FD&C yellow #6) aluminium lake (E110), polyethylene glycol, 
polyvinyl alcohol, talc (E553B), titanium dioxide (E171), iron oxide yellow (E172).  
The product is available in bottles with desiccant as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The active substance cobicistat is adsorbed on silicon dioxide. Cobicistat appears as a white to 
pale yellow, very hygroscopic amorphous solid, soluble in 0.1N HCl pH 1.9, sparingly soluble at 
pH 4.5, practically insoluble in water and at pH 6.8-8.2, freely soluble in methanol. The 
chemical name of cobicistat is 1,3-Thiazol-5-ylmethyl [(2R,5R)-5-{[(2S)-2-[(methyl{[2-
(propan-2-yl)-1,3-thiazol-4-yl] methyl}carbamoyl)amino]-4-(morpholin-4-yl)butanoyl]amino}-
1,6-diphenylhexan-2-yl]carbamate, corresponding to the structural formula below: 
The molecular formula is C 40H53N7O5S2 and its relative molecular mass 776.0 g/mol. It shows 
three pKa; 1.8 (thiazole group), 2.5 (alkylthiazole group) and 6.4 (morpholino group). The 
partition coefficient LogP is 4.3 (at pH 8.5 buffer). No crystal forms have been found. It has

three chiral centres and is produced as a single isomer. The stereochemical configuration is 
defined through the synthetic process and the use of starting material with suitable chirality. 
Appropriate specifications for these starting materials ensure consistent quality during 
manufacture of cobicistat. 
Cobicistat is an amorphous solid with a low glass transition temperature of 35 ºC. Because of 
the low glass transition temperature, cobicistat under ambient conditions undergoes moisture 
and temperature induced phase transition from a foam into a rubber-like material. To increase 
physical stability of cobicistat it is adsorbed on silicon dioxide. Cobicistat on silicon dioxide is a 
white to pale yellow amorphous powder and, as cobicistat, it is also hygroscopic, as determined 
by dynamic vapor sorption at room temperature. The relatively higher water uptake of 
cobicistat on silicon dioxide compared to cobicistat is due to the hygroscopic nature of the 
silicon dioxide carrier. Importantly however and contrary to cobicistat itself, moisture uptake of 
cobicistat on silicon dioxide is reversible and therefore cobicistat is isolated by adsorption on 
silicon dioxide to provide a stable solid form, which is suitable for further finished product 
manufacture. 
Manufacture 
Two sites are proposed for the manufacture of the active substance. Due to its physiochemical 
properties (see above) cobicistat is manufactured adsorbed on silicon dioxide. Cobicistat on 
silicon dioxide is manufactured in four well defined synthetic steps. Details about possible 
reprocessing have been provided. The route of synthesis has been described in sufficient detail 
and adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and 
control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been 
presented. Because the actual loading value of cobicistat on silicon dioxide is subject to 
manufacturing variability, a target loading with an appropriate range was adopted to ensure a 
robust down-stream manufacturing process. 
Both sites have manufactured commercial scale batches of cobicistat on silicon dioxide and 
many smaller scale batches during the development of the product. The first site has made 9 
large scale batches and the second has made 7 large scale batches. Batch analysis data show 
that the active substance produced by both manufacturers is of similar quality and can be 
manufactured reproducibly. 
Specification 
Cobicistat on silicon dioxide specification includes tests and limits for appearance (visual), 
identification (cobicistat: IR, HPLC, UV, silicon dioxide: chemical reaction), water content (Ph. 
Eur.), assay (HPLC), enantiomeric purity (chiral HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents 
(GC) and heavy metals (Ph. Eur.).  
No crystal forms have been identified and since the drug substance is produced as an 
amorphous solid adsorbed onto silicon dioxide, a test for polymorphism is not required as per 
ICH Q6A. 
Cobicistat genotoxic potential has been evaluated in accordance with the recommendations in 
ICH Q3A. All the identified impurities are of low concern for genotoxicity, and therefore no 
Assessment report  
Page 11/86 
 
  
  
 
further qualification studies were considered necessary. The proposed test and limits are 
acceptable.  
A microbial limit test for the drug substance is not required in accordance with ICH Q6A 
because the latter steps of the active substance manufacturing process are non-aqueous and 
have been shown to limit microbial content. In addition data presented on several batches 
during development indicate that no significant bioburden is present.  
All in-house analytical methods have been validated according to ICH Q2A principles. 
Batch analysis data for 9 representative large scale batches from the first site and 7 
representative large scale batches from the second manufacturer have been provided. In 
addition data for (smaller) batches used during development were also provided. The results 
comply with the specifications and confirm consistency and uniformity of the manufacturing 
process. 
Stability 
Two pilot scale and one production scale batch from the first manufacturer and one full scale 
batch from the second manufacturer packaged in the proposed container were put on stability 
testing in accordance with the ICH Q1A (R2) Guideline under long-term conditions at 5 °C for 
up to 24 months and accelerated at 25 °C/60% RH for up to 24 months. Appearance, water 
content, assay, impurities and chiral purity have been monitored. The analytical methods used 
are stability indicating. All physicochemical attributes of cobicistat on silicon dioxide remained 
within the specification acceptance limits following 24 months of long-term storage at 5 °C and 
no apparent trend has been observed. A statistical analysis performed for assay, total 
impurities and the major chiral impurity also demonstrate that there is little change over time. 
The physicochemical attributes of cobicistat on silicon dioxide remained also within the 
specification acceptance limits following 24 months of storage at 25 °C/60% RH. 
Furthermore, three of the above batches were also tested under 30 °C/75% RH for up to 12 
months to evaluate the stability of cobicistat on silicon dioxide at elevated temperatures that 
may be encountered during shipping and handling. The duration of temperature and humidity 
excursions is limited to 3 months. 
In addition, a photostability study was conducted on cobicistat on silicon dioxide according to 
ICH Q1B Guideline. The results showed no significant change in appearance, assay, and 
impurity content following exposure to light. The data indicate that cobicistat on silicon dioxide 
is not sensitive to light.  
Based on the presented stability data, the proposed re-test period and storage when the active 
substance is packed in the proposed packaging materials is acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
Tybost is an immediate-release tablet containing 150 mg of cobicistat. A solid oral dosage form 
was desired in order to provide patient dosing convenience for daily administration. The choice 
Assessment report  
Page 12/86 
 
  
  
 
of dosage form for the cobicistat drug product was also determined by the physical and 
chemical stability of the active ingredient, degradation pathways of the active ingredient, size 
of the unit dose, manufacturability, and biopharmaceutical performance of the active 
substance. Cobicistat is a BCS Class 2 compound, because its solubility is high under acidic 
conditions but not over the entire range of physiologically relevant pH. 
Different approaches were evaluated during development to enable the incorporation of 
cobicistat into a solid dosage formulation. Based on the evaluation of these approaches, 
cobicistat adsorbed onto silicon dioxide was the one chosen to be pursued further in 
development. The primary considerations for choosing cobicistat on silicon dioxide over spray 
dried material were the physicochemical properties of the material. There are no crystalline 
forms of cobicistat. Cobicistat is an amorphous solid and is used adsorbed on silicon dioxide 
because unlike cobicistat itself, the moisture uptake for cobicistat on silicon dioxide is 
reversible, whereas cobicistat that has been exposed to high humidity undergoes deliquescence 
and becomes a rubber-like material that is difficult to process and which does not revert back 
to its original state. The isolation of cobicistat on a solid carrier (silicon dioxide) resulted in 
avoiding an organic solvent used in the early stages of development that was necessary to 
prepare cobicistat in solution during the manufacture of the finished product. The product 
manufacture has been designed to allow for the range of loading levels of cobicistat on silicon 
dioxide. Silicon dioxide has specific use in this formulation apart from typical use as a glidant 
and it is used to adjust for the variability of cobicistat loading level on silicon dioxide. 
All the excipients used in the cobicistat tablet formulation are commonly used and meet the 
standards defined in Ph. Eur., except for the film-coating material. This film-coat material is 
commercially available and tested according to an in-house standard. All the components of the 
film-coating comply with the standards in Directive 2008/128/EC. The physical and chemical 
compatibility between cobicistat and the excipients in the formulation has been evaluated by 
studying prototype formulation matrices. 
The formulation composition was optimised by screening several prototype formulations in a 
high shear granulation process and evaluating different fillers and binders. Based on processing 
observations and dissolution profiles, a formulation with microcrystalline cellulose as filler and 
hydroxypropyl cellulose as binder was chosen for further studies. This blend was shown to have 
excellent compressibility and good tablet characteristics and satisfactory dissolution and was 
used for Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies. 
Based on clinical findings in the Phase 1 study, cobicistat tablets, 150 mg were chosen for 
further clinical evaluation. The formulation composition and manufacturing process for Phase 2 
studies were identical to those used in Phase 1 studies. 
The formulation was further adjusted for a dry granulation process. A pivotal bioequivalence 
(BE) study GS-US-216-01163 was performed to evaluate the formulation and process change 
for the incorporation of cobicistat active ingredient loaded on the silicon dioxide carrier as part 
of the final active substance isolation step. Both tablet formulations (dry granulation 
formulation and Phase 1/2 formulation) were confirmed to be bioequivalent for all three 
pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters tested: AUCtau, Cmax, and Ctau. 
During scale-up manufacturing of the dry granulated formulation a design of experiments 
(DOE) was performed on multiple small scale batches to establish the critical formulation and 
Assessment report  
Page 13/86 
 
  
  
 
process parameters that affect surface defect formation.  Based on the DOE results the 
formulation for the Phase 3 studies, primary stability batches and commercial formulation was 
selected. The tablet formulation for the Phase 3 study and the intended commercial product are 
of the identical formulation, manufactured by the same process, and compressed into tablets in 
the same dimensions and coating. 
A discriminatory dissolution method with regard to formulation and process changes has been 
developed for quality control purposes for release and stability testing. It was found that 
granulation particle size and underlying granulation processing parameters have no impact on 
dissolution and since the variables that affect dissolution are tightly controlled by the tablet 
manufacturing process, a single point acceptance criterion is appropriate for quality control 
dissolution testing of the drug product. 
Design of experiments was used to establish proven acceptable ranges (PARs) and normal 
operating ranges (NORs). PARs and NORs for the dry granulation, tablet compression and film-
coating steps have been established. Moving inside the PARs would be acceptable without 
regulatory post approval change assessment when the other process parameters are 
maintained at their target/ normal operating value. Overall, process optimization studies 
demonstrated the formulation and manufacturing process are robust, yielding drug product 
with desired quality attributes over a wide range of processing parameters. 
Adventitious agents 
None of the excipients used in the manufacture of Tybost tablets are of human or animal origin. 
Appropriate BSE/TSE declarations from the manufacturers of excipients have been provided. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing procedure for Tybost tablets is divided into four sets of unit processes: (1) 
dry granulation and final blending, (2) tablet compression, (3) film-coating, and (4) packaging. 
The manufacturing process is a standard process and a full description is provided. 
Intermediates of manufacturing are satisfactorily described and controlled and holding time is 
defined on these intermediates. 
The robustness of the manufacture has been demonstrated by successful process validation of 
3 representative batches at the lower end for the proposed batch size range. Process validation 
will be completed at the high end of the batch size range according to an agreed protocol prior 
to marketing. The robustness of the manufacturing procedure for the clinical and the proposed 
commercial formulation has been demonstrated by the successful manufacture of

Batch analysis results are submitted for 2 commercial scale and 5 smaller batches used 
throughout development and manufactured with active substance sourced from both suppliers. 
The batch analysis data are within the set specification limits and show that the Tybost tablets 
can be manufactured reproducibly. 
Stability of the product 
One commercial scale and three smaller batches in the proposed packaging were placed on 
stability according to ICH guidelines under the following conditions: long term 25 ± 2 °C / 60 ± 
5% RH, intermediate 30 ± 2 °C / 75 ± 5% RH and accelerated 40 ± 2 °C / 75 ± 5% RH. 
Results were provided for up to 24 months in long term and intermediate conditions and for 6 
months in accelerated conditions. Assay, degradation product content, and water content 
results were well within specifications at all conditions. No change in the dissolution profile was 
observed for the four batches tested. 
Potential enantiomers have been monitored in order to demonstrate that chiral purity is not 
affected under storage. Analytical methods were the same as for release and have been shown 
to be stability indicating.  
Statistical analysis was performed for assay, total degradation products, COBI-NOx, and COBI-
HIP, showing that the proposed shelf-life is appropriate. 
A photostability study was conducted on one batch of cobicistat tablets following the ICH Q1B 
Guideline. No degradation was noted after exposure to light. Additional stress studies under 
extreme temperature and humidity conditions were performed at 50 °C/ambient humidity and 
at 25 °C / 80% RH for 6 weeks. In addition to evaluate the stability of cobicistat tablets in the 
situation where tablets may be removed from the original container, tablets were directly 
exposed to 25 °C / 60% RH or 30 °C / 75% RH in an open dish for 6 weeks. Results met the 
specification for all quality test attributes after 6 weeks storage. No degradation was noted 
under any of the stress conditions: 25 °C / 80% RH; 50 °C; 25 °C / 60% RH on Petri dish or 
30 °C / 75% RH on Petri dish. 
The overall stability results support the proposed shelf life and storage conditions. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. Development of the drug product had to take into account 
the particular characteristics of the active substance and especially the need to ensure a 
physically and chemically stable form of cobicistat. The choice of formulation, of excipients and 
the manufacturing process has been justified. The results of tests carried out indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead 
to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the 
clinic.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the 
SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A comprehensive non clinical package was provided, including single-dose oral toxicity studies 
in mice and rats; repeat-dose oral toxicity studies in mice (up to 13 weeks), rats (up to 26 
weeks) and dogs (up to 39 weeks), genotoxicity tests both in vitro and in vivo; and a full 
developmental and reproductive toxicity program. Two-year oral carcinogenicity studies in mice 
and rats have also been provided within this submission. 
The pivotal toxicology and the majority of the safety pharmacology studies conducted by the 
applicant were reported to be GLP compliant. The safety studies that were not conducted to 
GLP were conducted to an appropriate scientific standard. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Cobicistat is a structurally modified analogue of the protease inhibitor, ritonavir (RTV), which is 
devoid of anti-retroviral activity.  COBI has been shown to inhibit the activity of human CYP3A 
enzymes (IC50 values 0.03 to 0.15 µM) and enzyme kinetic studies have demonstrated that it is 
an efficient inactivator of human CYP3A activity. The potency of the observed inhibition and 
inactivation was comparable to that observed with RTV and hence, the applicant has identified 
COBI as a mechanism-based inhibitor. 
Despite the extensive use of RTV, the precise mechanism of action remains unclear and there 
are data to suggest that RTV acts as a mechanism-based, competitive, mixed competitive-
noncompetitive CYP3A4 inhibitor and more recently an irreversible Type II inhibitor 
[Sevrioukova & Poulos, 2010].  The Applicant has provided evidence that the inhibition of 
CYP3A is time, NADPH and concentration dependent, which suggests that cobicistat is capable 
of mechanism-based inhibition.  However, the Applicant agrees that the precise molecular 
mechanism of inhibition is not completely understood and that overall, the mechanism may be 
mixed.   
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
During a radioligand binding assay to screen for interactions at a panel of receptor and ion 
channels, COBI showed significant binding to the benzothiazepine sensitive L-type calcium 
Assessment report  
Page 16/86 
 
  
  
 
channel, hERG potassium channel and sodium channel, site 2 at a concentration of 10 μM, 
which is 105 fold higher than the proposed clinical Cmax (free).  The effects of COBI on cardiac 
ion channels have been investigated further and the results are summarised in the safety 
pharmacology programme section. 
In vitro data indicate that when compared to the protease inhibitor, RTV; COBI shows a lower 
potential to inhibit host proteases (such as cathepsin D), affect adipocyte functions (such as 
lipid accumulation and inhibition of glucose uptake) and cause cytotoxicity in MT-2 
lymphoblastoid T-cells. The effects of COBI on the inhibition of chymotryptic-like activity of the 
26S proteasome and the viability of HepG2 hepatoma cells were similar to that observed with 
RTV. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
A series of safety pharmacology studies have been performed in order to evaluate the effects of 
COBI on the central nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory and renal systems.   
A single oral dose of COBI at 50 mg/kg had no effects on the central nervous system (CNS) in 
the rat.  At higher doses (≥ 150 mg/kg), salivation along with decreased arousal, locomotor 
activity, motor activity and a decrease in body temperature were noted 2 and 6 hours post 
dose.  The corresponding Cmax at the no-effect level was 5 ug/mL, which is approximately 4.2-
fold higher than that observed clinically. In the rat, following single oral doses of up to 500 
mg/kg, COBI had no effects on the respiratory rate, tidal volume, or derived minute volume. 
During electrophysiology studies, COBI inhibited the hERG potassium current and the hCav1.2 
L-type calcium channel, but was a weak inhibitor of the hNav1.5 sodium channel (with IC50 
values of 1.8-1.9 µM, 6 µM and 86.5 μM, respectively).  Given that the safety margin between 
the IC50 value for hERG inhibition and the observed clinical Cmax (free) was below 30, a series 
of additional studies were performed to further evaluate the potential for QT prolongation. In 
the rabbit purkinje fibre assay, COBI at ≥1 µM caused a significant shortening of action 
potential duration (APD60 and/or APD90); however, no changes in the other action potential 
parameters (that are predictive of QT prolongation) were observed.  In the isolated heart of the 
rabbit, shortening of the monophasic action potential duration (MAPD) was also observed at ≥ 
1 µM.  In addition, COBI was associated with a significant increase in coronary perfusion 
pressure (at ≥1.5 µM), decrease in ventricular function (at ≥1 µM; possibly secondary to 
interaction with cardiac calcium channels and/or the observed increase in perfusion pressure), 
decrease in the QT interval and increase in the PR and RR interval at ≥ 3 µM.  In vivo, no 
significant effect on QT interval was observed in the dog, following single oral doses of up to 45 
mg/kg.  Increases in PR interval were noted at ≥15 mg/kg where the plasma levels were 
reported to be 3.2 to 4.9 fold higher than that observed clinically.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Given that the use of ATV is associated with PR prolongation in man, that COBI also appears to 
increase PR interval (in vitro and in vivo), and that in man, COBI is to be used in combination 
with ATV (as part of an anti-retroviral treatment regimen), the effects of COBI (0.45 to 1.5 
µM)/ATV (1.5 µM) were evaluated in the rabbit isolated heart.  The effects on HR and PR 
interval appeared to be more pronounced when ATV (1.5 µM) and COBI (1.5 µM) were 
Assessment report  
Page 17/86 
 
  
  
 
administered in combination; however, the observed differences were not considered to be 
clinically significant. It is noted that during this study, COBI alone had no effect on the QT 
interval or MAPD at up to 1.5 µM, which is in contrast to the findings from the first study 
conducted in the isolated rabbit heart. The low concentrations of COBI within the post-perfusion 
buffer (as observed during the second study) along with differences in the experimental 
methods are thought to be responsible for the observed difference in the results. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The in vitro absorption, metabolism of COBI, and the potential to cause drug interactions were 
studied in the appropriate model systems.  
In support of the studies conducted to GLP, analysis of COBI in plasma from mice, rats, rabbits 
and dogs utilized fully validated methods based upon LC/MS/MS. 
In fasted male animals, the absolute oral bioavailability for COBI (in solution) was estimated to 
be 33%, 11% and 7% in the rat, dog and monkey, respectively.  Although there were some 
deviations, in general, following single or repeated oral administration in the mouse, rat and 
dog, systemic exposures increased in a manner that was greater than proportional with dose 
(reflecting saturation of first-pass metabolism) and following saturation, systemic exposures 
generally increased in a dose-proportional manner.  In the mouse and rat, exposures to COBI 
did not appear to change significantly over time; however, in the dog, there was some evidence 
of accumulation upon repeated dosing (possibly due to differential effects on the induction of 
CYP3A enzymes).  In the mouse and dog, there were no appreciable sex differences in systemic 
exposure.  However, in the female rat, exposures were approximately 2-fold higher than in 
males, which is consistent with the known gender difference in CYP3A expression in this 
species. 
In the rat, combination studies have been performed where COBI was administered in 
combination with the protease inhibitor, atazanavir (ATV) or the integrase strand-transfer 
inhibitor, elvitegravir (EVG).  In a 13-week study, exposures to ATV were higher when ATV was 
administered in combination with COBI; which generally supports its proposed use. 
In the species evaluated, the binding to plasma proteins (in vitro) was considered to be 
moderately high (90.9 to 97.7%) and the distribution to red blood cells (in vivo) was low.  
Following single oral administration of radiolabelled-COBI to the Sprague Dawley rat, drug 
related radioactivity was widely distributed.  The peak tissue concentrations were achieved at 1 
hour post-dose and the highest tissue:plasma ratios were observed in the liver, adrenal gland, 
kidney, pituitary gland and thyroid gland, which correlates with the principal findings from the 
toxicity studies.  The distribution profile in pigmented (Long Evans) rats was comparable to that 
of albino rats; however, the levels of radioactivity in the eyes (uveal tracts) of pigmented rats 
were higher and higher concentrations of radioactivity were observed in pigmented skin, when 
compared to non pigmented skin; which suggests an association of COBI and/or its metabolites 
with melanin.  Data from a pre/post-natal study in the rat indicate that COBI distributes into 
the milk of lactating rats, whereby the milk:plasma ratios ranged from 1.3 to 1.9.   
In vitro metabolism in all species yields 3 predominant primary oxidative metabolites [M21, 
M26, and M31 (GS-9612)]. In vivo, COBI is the major radioactive component circulating in 
plasma and the 3 metabolites, along with M39, another common primary metabolite, were the 
Assessment report  
Page 18/86 
 
  
  
 
4 most abundant metabolites in the mouse, rat, dog, and human.  There are no unique or 
major (> 10%) human metabolites.  For M31 and M26, the observed inhibition of CYP3A was 
similar to or marginally lower than that observed with COBI.  M21 and M26 had no effect on the 
activities of the other CYP enzymes, but M31 was shown to inhibit CYP2C19 (IC50 2.95 µM) and 
CYP2D6 (IC50 0.21 µM).  As the circulating levels of these metabolites in man are extremely 
low, the observed CYP enzyme inhibition is unlikely to contribute to the observed 
pharmacological effects of COBI or potential drug interactions. 
Cobicistat is metabolized rapidly by hepatic microsomal fractions from non-clinical species, but 
exhibits self-limiting metabolism with human hepatic microsomal fractions, due to concurrent 
enzyme inactivation.  CYP3A (major) and CYP2D6 (minor) enzymes appear to be responsible 
for the in vitro human metabolism of COBI and there is no evidence for metabolism by direct 
conjugation. 
Following oral administration of [14C]COBI in the rat and dog, the majority of the radioactivity 
(≥ 65%) was recovered in bile, faeces and urine (the majority in the bile), confirming 
absorption in vivo. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The general toxicity, genotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, local tolerance, immunotoxicity and the 
potential for hypersensitivity to COBI alone have been characterized during a series of in vitro 
and in vivo studies (Table 1). Combination toxicity studies with ATV or EVG, compounds that 
are boosted by COBI, were also conducted.  Apart from the different mechanism of action on 
CYP inhibition between humans and rats and dogs, the rat and dog were considered appropriate 
species for the toxicology studies because of the similar metabolism of COBI in humans and the 
ability to achieve high systemic exposures in these species. 
All in vivo studies conducted with COBI, utilized oral administration, which is the proposed 
clinical route, with the exception of the sensitization, eye and dermal irritation studies.

Following single oral administration in the mouse and rat, no test article related signs were 
observed at up to 100 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg respectively. In mouse, the NOAEL was 100 
mg/kg. In rat, the NOAEL was 500 mg/kg. The corresponding Cmax values in the mouse and 
plasma concentrations at 1 hour post-dose in the mouse and rat respectively, were 13.2- and 
4.54 to 5.6-fold higher than the observed clinical Cmax. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The NOAEL of COBI when administered to CD-1 mice via daily oral gavage for 13 weeks was 50 
mg/kg/day in females based on the absence of any toxicologically significant adverse effects; 
and 5 mg/kg/day in males. The NOAEL for COBI was 30 mg/kg/day when administered daily 
via oral gavage to rats for 26 weeks. The NOAEL for COBI was 10 mg/kg/day when 
administered daily by oral gavage to dogs for 39 weeks.

Following repeated oral administration of COBI, the primary target organs were the liver 
(mouse, rat, and dog) and thyroid (rat only).  Slight, non-adverse haematological changes 
were noted in the rat and slight changes in clinical chemistry parameters were observed in the 
mouse, rat, and dog, with urinalysis changes (increases in albumin:globulin ratio, urine volume 
and pH and lower urine specific gravity) noted primarily at high doses in rat and dog, where the 
exposures exceeded those proposed clinically.  In the rat, the observed effects on the thyroid 
(increased thyroid weight and follicular hyperplasia/hypertrophy), are considered rodent-
specific, secondary to microsomal enzyme induction and thyroid hormone imbalance (decreased 
levels of T4 and thyroid-stimulating hormone), and it is unlikely that COBI presents a risk to 
the thyroid in man. 
Hepatic changes in mice, rats, and dogs included microsomal enzyme induction [CYP2B (mouse 
only) and CYP3A (in mouse and rat only)], increased liver weights, and hepatocellular 
hypertrophy and/or vacuolation.  All effects appeared to be completely reversible after a 1- or 
3-month recovery period and/or are considered to be adaptive responses.  Urinalysis changes 
(higher urine volume, lower urine specific gravity, increases in electrolyte excretion) showed no 
progression after long term dosing, were not associated with remarkable serum chemistry or 
histopathological correlates, and were reversible. 
Other potential toxicities related to COBI that were observed in non-clinical studies include PR 
interval prolongation in the 4-week dog study and decreases in left ventricular (LV) function in 
isolated rabbit hearts.  The safety pharmacology data as described previously suggest that 
there may be a potential for additive effects when COBI is administered in combination with 
ATV; however the observed effects were not considered to be clinically significant.  Overall, the 
combination toxicity studies of COBI with EVG or ATV did not result in unexpected or additive 
toxicities. 
Genotoxicity 
The results from a bacterial reverse mutation test, mouse lymphoma assay and in vivo rat 
micronucleus assay all indicate that cobicistat does not pose a genotoxic risk to man. 
Carcinogenicity 
In the mouse, following repeated oral administration for a minimum of 95 weeks (males) or 87 
weeks (females), COBI was not carcinogenic at exposures that were 7 to 16 fold higher than 
those observed clinically.  In the rat, following repeated oral administration for a minimum of 
97 weeks at 10, 25, and 50 mg/kg/day (males) and 5, 15, and 30 mg/kg/day (females), COBI 
caused an increased incidence of combined thyroid follicular cell adenoma and carcinomas at 
exposures (AUC) that were lower than that observed clinically.  It is acknowledged that the 
thyroid and liver changes are considered adaptive changes, secondary to hepatic microsomal 
enzyme induction due to activation of PXR.  Given that this extent of activation of PXR and 
CYP3A does not occur at clinically relevant concentrations in humans, COBI is not considered to 
pose a carcinogenic risk in man.

Reproduction Toxicity 
No adverse effects on male or female fertility and reproductive performance were observed at 
up to 100 mg/kg/day, where the corresponding exposures (AUC) are at least 3 fold higher than 
that observed clinically.  During a rat embryofetal development study, increased post-
implantation loss and skeletal variations (ossification changes in the spinal column and 
sternebra) along with decreased fetal weights (associated with significant decreases in maternal 
body weights) were observed at 125 mg/kg/day.  The exposures at the no-effect level for 
embryo/fetal viability and growth and developmental toxicity were similar to that proposed 
clinically.  In the rabbit, there were no treatment-related effects on embryo/fetal viability and 
growth and no fetal anomalies at systemic exposures that were 6 fold higher than that 
proposed clinically. 
The applicant has indicated that no remarkable findings occurred during the reproductive 
toxicity studies conducted with ATV and that darunavir was associated with a transient 
reduction in body weight gain during lactation.

In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific 
progress, the CHMP recommends the following point for further investigation: 
•  An updated environmental risk assessment which clarifies the effects of COBI on 
sediment dwelling organisms should be provided (by Q2 2015). 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Cobicistat is a structurally modified analogue of the protease inhibitor, ritonavir (RTV), which is 
devoid of anti-retroviral activity. COBI has been shown to inhibit the activity of human CYP3A 
enzymes (IC50 values 0.03 to 0.15 µM) and enzyme kinetic studies have demonstrated that it is 
an efficient inactivator of human CYP3A activity.  Data from the secondary pharmacology 
studies suggest that the potential for side effects (that are due to interactions at these 
secondary targets) with COBI is roughly similar to that observed with RTV. 
In the isolated heart of the rabbit, shortening of the monophasic action potential duration 
(MAPD) was also observed at ≥  1 µM.  In addition, COBI was associated with a significant 
increase in coronary perfusion pressure (at ≥ 1.5 µM), decrease in ventricular function (at ≥ 1 
µM; possibly secondary to interaction with cardiac calcium channels and/or the observed 
increase in perfusion pressure), decrease in the QT interval and increase in the PR and RR 
interval at ≥  3 µM.  However, in vivo, no significant effect on QT interval was observed in the 
dog, following single oral doses of up to 45 mg/kg.  Increases in PR interval were noted at ≥ 15 
mg/kg where the plasma levels were reported to be 3.2 to 4.9 fold higher than that observed 
clinically. 
In vitro metabolism in all species yields 3 predominant primary oxidative metabolites [M21, 
M26, and M31 (GS-9612)]. Cobicistat is metabolized rapidly by hepatic microsomal fractions 
from non-clinical species, but exhibits self-limiting metabolism with human hepatic microsomal 
fractions, due to concurrent enzyme inactivation. CYP3A (major) and CYP2D6 (minor) enzymes 
appear to be responsible for the in vitro human metabolism of COBI. 
The intended, positive pharmacokinetic interaction between COBI and darunavir/atazanavir is 
an increase in the bioavailability and a decrease in the rate of elimination of the antiviral agent 
due to inhibition of CYP3A activity by COBI. This interaction has been well characterized in 
vitro. The data suggest that COBI does not inactivate CYP3A enzymes appreciably in rat, dog 
and monkey, which would suggest that the mode of inhibition is different in these species when 
compared to man. 
A comprehensive toxicology package was provided, including single-dose oral toxicity studies in 
mice and rats; repeat-dose oral toxicity studies in mice (up to 13 weeks), rats (up to 26 
Assessment report  
Page 23/86 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
weeks), dogs (up to 39 weeks), genotoxicity tests both in vitro and in vivo; and a full 
developmental and reproductive toxicity program.  Two-year oral carcinogenicity studies in 
mice and rats have also been provided. 
During a rat embryofetal development study, increased post-implantation loss and skeletal 
variations and decreased fetal weights (associated with significant decreases in maternal body 
weights) were observed at 125 mg/kg/day. The exposures at the no-effect level for 
embryo/fetal viability and growth and developmental toxicity were similar to that proposed 
clinically. Data from a pre/post-natal study in the rat indicate that COBI distributes into the 
milk of lactating rats, whereby the milk:plasma ratios ranged from 1.3 to 1.9 and hence; a risk 
to newborns or infants cannot be excluded. 
The results from a bacterial reverse mutation test, mouse lymphoma assay and in vivo rat 
micronucleus assay all indicate that cobicistat does not pose to genotoxic risk to man. 
A long term carcinogenicity study of cobicistat in rats revealed tumorigenic potential specific for 
this species, these findings were not considered to be clinically relevant.  A long term 
carcinogenicity study in mice did not show any carcinogenic potential. 
The applicant has conducted a full environmental risk assessment.  The water-sediment-study 
(OECD 308) clearly shows that the active ingredient cobicistat is persistent in the total water-
sediment system; with a DT50 of 171-241 days, which exceeds the trigger value for 
“persistence”.  In addition, the CHMP note that the dataset are incomplete:  As sediment 
shifting of the drug substance was demonstrated (sediment shifting > 10%), the CHMP 
recommended the Applicant to investigate the effects on sediment organisms and the data will 
be submitted post-authorisation. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Cobicistat is a structurally modified analogue of the protease inhibitor, ritonavir (RTV), which is 
devoid of anti-retroviral activity and is a selective inhibitor of cytochrome P450 CYP3A.The non-
clinical data reveal no specific hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated 
dose toxicity, genotoxicity, toxicity to reproduction and development, genotoxicity and 
carcinogenicity. However, non-clinical data have demonstrated excretion of cobicistat in milk 
and hence, a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Therefore COBI should not be 
used during breast-feeding.

GS-US-216-0114 (Week 96 data cut) and GS-US-236-0118 (Week 24 data cut) as well as new 
data from GS-US-216-0130 (Week 24 CSR) were provided. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of cobicistat (COBI) were assessed in Phase 1 studies with 
COBI alone, on co-administration with elvitegravir (EVG) and as a component of the QUAD STR. 
The Phase 2 and 3 studies of efficacy included intensive PK sub-studies and sparse sampling. A 
population PK analysis was conducted. 
Formulations  
The immediate release formulation used in the Phase 3 study (F2) and the proposed 
commercial product are of identical formulation, manufactured by the same process and 
compressed into tablets with the same dimensions and coating. Other formulations (e.g. F1) 
were used throughout the clinical development. 
Analytical methods 
Determination of COBI concentrations (GS-9350) in plasma involved SPE followed by LC-MS/MS 
with positive ionisation. The method was validated. Calibration curves for initial assays ranged 
from 5 (LLQ) to 1000 or 2500 ng/mL. In a later version of the assay the range was 10-5000 
ng/mL. The range for the human metabolite GS-9612 (also numbered GS-364751 [E3] or M31) 
was 5-2500 ng/mL while the range for the human metabolites GS-341842 (also numbered [E5] 
or M26) and GS-342006 (or GS-9454 also numbered [E1] or M21) was 5-5000 ng/mL.  
Assessment report  
Page 27/86 
 
 
  
  
 
Absorption  
Bioavailability 
The absolute bioavailability of COBI has not been investigated. COBI was found to have high 
forward permeability through Caco-2 cells and showed no evidence for marked efflux. It was 
found to be a substrate for MDR1 or BCRP based on increased efflux ratios in MDR1 and BCRP 
over-expressing cells. COBI efflux ratios were decreased by the MDR1 inhibitor cyclosporin A 
(10 μM) and the BCRP inhibitor Ko134 (10 μM). 
GS-US-216-0101 (50 - 200 mg) and GS-US-216-0113 (300 - 400 mg) evaluated the 
administration of COBI in the fed state. There were much greater than dose-proportional 
increases in Cmax and AUC that were considered to be due to reduced clearance (apparent 
clearance 10-15% of hepatic blood flow) and higher bioavailability (reduction in first pass 
effect) consistent with metabolic auto-inhibition properties.  
GS-US-216-0116 compared the Phase 3 formulation of COBI (F2) with the Phase 2 version (F1) 
on dosing with 150 mg daily for 10 days.  The 90% CIs around the GMRs for COBI AUCtau, Ctau, 
and Cmax showed bioequivalence between the formulations.   
Influence of food 
A food effect study was not conducted for COBI.  GS-US-236-0105 evaluated the effect of 
fasting, light and high-fat meals on the PK of COBI when the F1 formulation of the QUAD STR 
was administered. COBI AUCinf, AUClast and Cmax met bioequivalence criteria for light meal and 
fasted conditions. There were decreases (ranging from 17% to 27%) observed with a 
high-calorie/high-fat meal vs. the fasted state or vs. dosing after light meal. 
The decreased COBI AUClast (6570.2 [49.1] ng•h/mL) observed following the high-calorie, 
high-fat meal (relative to the light meal or fasting conditions) did not affect the exposures of 
COBI-boosted EVG, suggesting that regardless of the type of food COBI plasma levels provided 
adequate CYP3A inhibition. COBI was to be taken with food (unspecified) in the Phase 2 and 3 
studies. Following administration of ATV/co in GS-US-216-0105 and GS-US-216-0114 the mean 
(%CV) COBI AUCs were 9034.0 (44.6) ng•h/mL and 11,113.2 (40.5) ng•h/mL, respectively. In 
addition, the population PK analysis of data from these studies gave a mean COBI AUC of 
8923.9 ng•h/mL. 
Distribution 
When [14C] COBI (150 mg COBI dose) was administered on the last day of a multiple-dose 
period to healthy subjects (GS-US-216-0111) the blood-to-plasma ratio of total 14C -
radioactivity was time-independent and ~ 0.5, indicating that COBI is excluded from the 
cellular components of the blood. 
Based on equilibrium dialysis studies COBI was ~97% to 98% bound to human plasma proteins 
regardless of concentration. In GS-US-183-0133 COBI was highly protein bound in plasma from 
normal subjects and those with moderate hepatic impairment with overall unbound fractions of 
2.71% ± 0.56% and 3.23% ± 0.63%, respectively. In GS-US-216-0124 COBI was highly 
protein bound in plasma from normal subjects and those with severe renal impairment with 
overall unbound fractions of 2.49% ± 0.92% and 2.47% ± 0.62%, respectively. 
Assessment report  
Page 28/86 
 
  
  
 
Elimination 
In the steady state mass balance study GS-US-216-0111 radiolabeled COBI (150 mg dose of 
[14C]COBI) was given on day 7 following administration of 150 mg daily for 6 days in the fed 
state. Peak [14C]COBI plasma concentrations were observed at 4.5 h post-dose. The estimates 
for Cmax and AUCtau were similar to values seen in other studies but the half-life was longer. 
COBI was the predominant species in plasma in the first 24 h (98.6% of the circulating 
radioactivity) with no quantifiable metabolites. In most subjects, plasma radioactivity was not 
detectable beyond 32 h and was BLQ in all subjects by 96 h.  
Total recovery of radioactivity was 94% and most (86.2%) of the dose was recovered in faeces, 
consistent with hepatobiliary excretion. A mean of 62.3% of the total radioactive dose was 
quantified and comprised primarily the parent drug or the oxidative metabolites M21 or M31. 
COBI was the major species in the faeces (27%) followed by M31 (14%), and M21 (5.5%). All 
other metabolites in the faeces were in trace amounts and did not exceed 3% of the dose. Only 
8.2% was recovered in urine, primarily as unchanged parent drug (5.5%) and with low levels of 
metabolites M21 and M31 (each < 1%). Most of the recovered dose in urine (8%) appeared 
within 48 h. COBI displayed both dose- and time-dependent changes in apparent clearance 
(CL/F), consistent with the properties of a mechanism-based inhibitor. 
Metabolism 
In-vitro studies showed that COBI is extensively metabolised via CYP3A (major) and CYP2D6 
(minor) mediated oxidation with no evidence of direct Phase 2 metabolism. There are no unique 
or major (>10%) human metabolites.  
Primary metabolites include isopropyl oxidation (M31), cleavage at the N-methylurea (M26), 
cleavage of the carbamate (M21) and cleavage and deethylation of the morpholine (M39). 
CYP3A can catalyse all reactions, while CYP2D6 contributes to the generation of M31. Mean 
plasma exposures of M31 were < 3% of COBI exposure (AUC) after a single 150 mg dose in the 
mass-balance study. The three most abundant human metabolites of COBI are weaker 
inhibitors of CYP3A compared to COBI and are not considered likely to contribute to CYP3A 
inhibition. 
Population PK analysis 
The population PK report for COBI was based on a model derived from intensive sampling data 
from: 
-  11 Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects (8 with COBI; 3 with QUAD STR) 
-  5 studies in HIV-infected subjects, comprising: 
Two COBI studies - GS-US-216-0105 (Phase 2) and 0114 (Phase 3)  
Three QUAD STR studies GS-US-236-0104 (Phase 2) and the two Phase 3 studies 0102 and 
0103  
The model was based on log-normalised COBI concentration-time data and consisted of one 
central compartment with linear and nonlinear elimination pathways.  
Assessment report  
Page 29/86 
 
  
  
 
A one-compartment PK model with zero- and first-order absorption rate constant, an absorption 
lag time and including the effect of body weight on the apparent volume of distribution of COBI 
provided a good description of COBI PK after repeated dosing with 150 mg in healthy subjects 
and HIV-infected patients.  
Inclusion of body weight resulted in a marginal decrease in the inter-individual variability 
associated with the apparent volume of distribution (COBI Vc/F 8.9% to 6.3%). A statistically 
significant positive correlation was observed between weight and COBI Vc/F but the effect was 
modest. Relative to the median weight (74.4 kg), the range of observed weights (57–101 kg; 
5th to 95th percentile) resulted in differences of -22% and +24%, respectively, corresponding to 
a +37% and -27% change in exposure from the population median COBI AUCtau of 10234 
ng•hr/mL. Median COBI exposures within the bottom 5th and upper 95th percentile of weight 
were 14063 ng•hr/mL and 7507 ng•hr/mL, respectively, which were considered sufficient to 
achieve a robust boosting effect.  
Phase 2 - GS-US-216-0105 
See section on Clinical Efficacy for study design. An intensive PK sub-study was performed at 
the Week 2, 4 or 8 visit (target n = 24 evaluable) when dosing followed a standard breakfast. A 
single trough sample was collected from all subjects 20-24 h following an observed dose at 
Weeks 8, 24 and 48. Also, a single sample was collected at Weeks 2, 4, 12, 16, 32 and 40 from 
non sub-study subjects. The COBI and RTV levels fall within the range observed in other 
studies. 
Plasma concentrations of ATV were slightly higher on boosting with RTV vs. COBI. 
From the sampling at trough (20-24 h post-dose) at week 8, 24 and 48 in larger numbers the 
mean concentrations of ATV were slightly higher in the ATV/COBI group but at each time point 
the CV% in the ATV/COBI group was greater than that in the ATV/RTV group.  
Table 3.  GS-US-216-0105: Summary of ATV plasma concentration parameters for trough PK 
sample (PK substudy analysis set) 
Phase 3 - GS-US-216-0114 
See section on Clinical Efficacy for study design. An intensive PK sub-study was performed in a 
subset (target n = 48 evaluable) at selected study sites with a sampling visit at Weeks 2-8 on 
ATV/co+TVD.  
The ATV plasma levels tended to be slightly lower when given with COBI vs. RTV. PK 
parameters are summarised in the table below, in which the magnitude of the higher FTC and 
TFV but lower ATV plasma levels on co-administration with COBI are demonstrated. The CV% 
values should also be noted for the ATV C max and AUC when given with either COBI or RTV. 
Assessment report  
Page 30/86 
 
 
 
  
  
 
Table 4.  GS-US-216-0114: Summary of ATV, COBI, RTV, FTC and TFV PK parameters (PK 
substudy analysis set) 
Overall, the differences observed between PK parameters with ATV/co+TVD vs. ATV/r+TVD 
were not considered likely to be clinically important. The mean ATV Ctau values with ATV/COBI 
or ATV/RTV were 56.9-fold or 61.0-fold, respectively, above the protein-binding adjusted IC90 
against wild-type HIV-1 (14 ng/mL). 
The higher exposure to TFV (Cmax and AUC) when co-administered with COBI rather than RTV 
was explored and the possible explanations were considered. The renal excretion of TFV 
involves uptake by OAT1 and OAT3 and efflux by MRP4. COBI showed no inhibition of OAT1 and 
minimal inhibition of OAT3 and MRP4. The magnitude of increase in TFV exposure when 
administered with COBI was comparable to that observed with other Pgp inhibitors such as RTV 
and rilpivirine (RPV). In the additional study GS-US-216-0134 that evaluated the interaction 
between TDF and COBI. The Cmax and AUC of TFV were higher upon single- or multiple-dose 
administration of COBI plus TDF vs. TDF alone but COBI did not affect the elimination of TFV 
(median t 1/2: 10.96 h for TDF alone vs. 10.87 h on co-administration). These results were 
consistent with inhibition of Pgp-mediated intestinal efflux of TDF by COBI.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In the single- and multiple-dose administration of COBI in healthy subjects PK studies, 
cobicistat displayed both dose- and time-dependent changes in apparent clearance (CL/F) with 
nonlinear increases in systemic exposure. 
Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
COBI AUCs observed in subjects with mild/moderate renal impairment in GS-US-216-0121 and 
in subjects with severe renal impairment in GS-US-216-0124 were higher than for matched 
normal controls but in both cases were within the range observed in healthy subjects with 
normal renal function (CL cr ≥ 80 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault method) at the 150 mg 
dose. 
Assessment report  
Page 31/86 
 
 
 
  
  
 
GS-US-216-0124 evaluated dosing subjects with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min; 
actual mean 23.5 mL/min) not on dialysis and matched [age, sex and BMI] healthy controls 
(eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min; actual mean 97.2 mL/min) with 150 mg of each once daily in the fed state 
for 7 days. The AUCtau, Cmax and Ctau were modestly higher (by 25%, 22% and 13%, 
respectively) in those with severe renal impairment but the differences were considered not 
clinically relevant. On Day 7 of co-administration the eGFRCG was 10.5% lower vs. baseline 
among subjects with severe renal impairment and 8.4% lower among controls. A similar 
pattern of change was observed for eGFRMDRD. Values returned to baseline levels by Day 14. 
The decreases in eGFR were attributed to inhibition of proximal tubular secretion of creatinine 
by COBI mainly via inhibition of MATE1. 
Table 5.  GS-US-216-0124: Statistical analysis of COBI PK parameters on day & between 
severely renally impaired and normal subjects (COBI PK analysis set) 
Impaired hepatic function 
GS-US-183-0133 evaluated dosing COBI 150 mg daily for 10 days to subjects with moderate 
hepatic impairment (CPT B; actual scores were 7-9) and matched [age, sex and BMI] healthy 
controls. Mean creatinine clearance was estimated at 98.7 ml/min and 116.8 ml/min in 
respective groups. AUCtau and Cmax were generally comparable between subjects with moderate 
hepatic impairment and controls while T max was prolonged by 1 h (from 3 to 4 h). The median 
T1/2 was longer (6.05 h vs. 3.99 h) resulting in a higher Ctau (Geometric Least-Squares Mean 
GLSM ratio 208%) in the presence of moderate hepatic impairment. The mean percent free 
fractions for COBI were 2.71% in the control subjects and 3.23% in subjects with moderate 
hepatic impairment. 
There were no clinically relevant correlations between COBI exposures and CPT score or its 
individual laboratory components (i.e. albumin, total bilirubin, prothrombin time and INR) for 
subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, consistent with the lack of relevant PK changes.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Effect of COBI alone on substrates of CYP3A4 
During GS-US-216-0101 a dose of midazolam (MDZ) 5 mg (oral syrup) was administered on 
Day 0 and on the final day (D14) of dosing with COBI or RTV. MDZ plasma exposures increased 
and clearance decreased as a result of the effects of RTV and COBI doses from 50 – 200 mg. 
COBI 200 mg and RTV 100 mg exhibited similar inhibition of MDZ CL/F (−94.8% and –95.6%, 
respectively) and gave 19.2- and 22.5-fold increases in MDZ AUC (vs. MDZ alone). COBI 100 
mg achieved only slightly less inhibition of MDZ CL/F (−92.7% vs. MDZ alone). MDZ clearance 
was 247%, 166% and 118% with COBI doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg, respectively, relative to 
Assessment report  
Page 32/86 
 
 
 
  
  
 
that observed with 100 mg RTV and the corresponding AUCinf were 41%, 60% and 85%, 
respectively, relative to RTV.  
Plasma concentrations of 1-OH-MDZ also decreased with increasing doses of COBI. On D14 the 
1-OH-MDZ PK values for the COBI 100 (n=11) and 200 (n=12) mg doses and RTV (n=9) 
suggested that 200 mg COBI behaved similarly to RTV 100 mg. 
GS-US-216-0119 compared the effects of COBI 150 mg BID (twice daily) on DRV (600 mg BID) 
and Tipranavir (TPV) (500 mg BID) with the effects of RTV 100 mg (with DRV) or 200 mg (with 
TPV) twice daily. Other groups received DRV/COBI BID plus either EVG 150 mg QD or etravirine 
(ETR) 200 mg BID.  
COBI 150 mg BID alone resulted in higher concentrations and exposures compared to data 
from studies using 150 mg QD. The COBI Cmax of 2991.6 ng/mL (CV% 28.2) was ~2-fold 
higher (vs. 1598 ng/mL) and the AUCtau of 23,083.4 ng•h/mL (giving AUC24 ~46,200 ng•h/mL) 
was ~4-fold higher (vs. 12430 ng.h/mL) than the corresponding data reported from GS-US-
216-0116 for the final formulation.  
COBI AUCtau was ~ 50% lower when given with DRV vs. COBI alone. Addition of EVG to the 
DRV/COBI regimen did not affect COBI exposures further. After addition of ETR the COBI 
AUCtau was lower (20%) but this was not considered to be of importance. COBI exposures were 
~ 90% lower when given with TPV vs. COBI alone, which reflected the induction of CYP3A by 
TPV.  
DRV exposure parameters, including Ctau, met bioequivalence criteria when it was given with 
COBI vs. RTV regardless of addition of EVG or ETV. In contrast, TPV exposures were markedly 
lower when given with COBI vs. TPV/RTV. 
Effect of COBI alone on substrates of other CYP isoenzymes 
GS-US-216-0112 was designed to evaluate the effects of COBI on CYP2D6 and 2B6 and on P-
gp. Three Cohorts of subjects were enrolled to receive the following oral treatments in the fed 
state: 
Cohort 1 (CYP2D6)  A: Desipramine 50 mg as a single dose in the morning 
B: COBI 150 mg once daily for 10 days + desipramine 50 mg on the 10th 
day 
Cohort 2 (P-gp) 
C: Digoxin 0.5 mg as a single dose in the morning 
D: COBI 150 mg once daily for 10 days + digoxin 0.5 mg on the 10th day 
Cohort 3 (CYP2B6) 
E: EFV 600 mg as a single dose in the morning 
F: COBI 150 mg once daily for 10 days + EFV 600 mg on the 10th day 
Co-administration of desipramine with COBI resulted in lower plasma levels for the first 4 h but 
there were overall increases in C max, AUCinf and AUC 0−last compared to desipramine alone. 
Correspondingly, the desipramine T1/2 was prolonged and CL/F reduced on co-administration. 
Based on 58% and 65% increases in desipramine AUC0−last and AUCinf, respectively, and a 24% 
increase in Cmax the applicant classified COBI as a weak CYP2D6 inhibitor. 
Assessment report  
Page 33/86 
 
  
  
 
Digoxin Cmax and AUC0−last increased but AUCinf remained unchanged with co-administration. 
The applicant considered that although COBI is regarded as a weak inhibitor of P-gp it is highly 
soluble and may achieve transient inhibition of gut P-gp during its absorption, which is the 
likely explanation for the increase in digoxin Cmax. Following a COBI dose of 150 mg the 
reference theoretical concentration in the intestine is 10 × 150 mg/250 mL (7700 µM). When 
compared to the IC50 for Pgp (36 µM), this suggests that intestinal interactions between COBI 
and Pgp substrates will take place (ratio = 214). This prediction is consistent with 
GS-US-216-0112 in which COBI increased the Cmax of the Pgp substrate digoxin (mean increase 
of 41%) without a significant effect on AUCinf (7.7% increase). There was a numerical decrease 
in T1/2 on co-administration, which the applicant described as unexpected since it was not 
predicted that COBI reaches sufficient concentrations to inhibit renal P-gp.  
EFV Cmax decreased (13%) but AUC0−last/inf remained unchanged when co-administered with 
COBI. The 90% CI fell within the 80, 125% bounds but there were numerically lower plasma 
exposures to EFV when given with COBI. This was unexpected as the induction potential of 
COBI and the expression of CYP2B6 in the intestine are low. However, co-administration of 
COBI with EFV is anyway not recommended as co-administration of COBI with medicinal 
products that are moderate to weak inducers of CYP3A (e.g. EFV). 
Other DDI studies 
In the EVG+COBI (150/150 mg) study GS-US-201-0104 co-administration with 800 mg QD 
DRV gave plasma levels of all three agents that were lower than observed in other studies. In 
particular, co-administration resulted in 40% to 50% lower trough concentrations of EVG and 
DRV, relative to historical reference exposures for each boosted agent administered alone, 
indicating that COBI 150 mg is not sufficient for boosting both DRV and EVG. The mechanism 
for reduced exposure is likely induction. Activation of PXR by DRV can lead to increased 
expression of enzymes that metabolize COBI (CYP3A), EVG (CYP3A and UGT1A1) and DRV 
(CYP3A and CYP2C19). The same phenomenon was observed with the interaction between the 
inducer rifabutin and COBI and EVG. Therefore, cobicistat should not be used in combination 
with another ARV that requires boosting (i.e. another PI or EVG). Due to lack of data a similar 
warning is made regarding use of ATV/co with other agents requiring boosting. 
The aqueous solubility of COBI free base (0.075 mg/mL, pH ~ 7) is significantly enhanced 
under acidic conditions at pH 2 (70 mg/mL). GS-US-216-0120 evaluated co-administrations 
over 8 days of EVG/COBI 150/150 mg each morning in the fed state alone (A) with omeprazole 
(C - 20 mg in the fasted state in the morning but 2 h before COBI/EVG; D – 20 mg in the 
fasted state in the evening) or with famotidine (B; 40 mg with food in the evening) in different 
cohorts of subjects. Omeprazole and famotidine did not affect PK EVG or COBI when dosing was 
separated by 12 h. When omeprazole was given 2 h before EVG/COBI (C) there was no 
appreciable effect on PK COBI.  
GS-US-216-0122 then evaluated EVG/COBI 150/150 mg co-administered with famotidine 40 
mg once daily in the fed state and showed no significant effects on PK EVG or COBI.  
GS-US-216-0123 evaluated once daily dosing of EVG/COBI 150/150 mg in the fed state with 
and without each of a single dose of rosuvastatin 10 mg, ATV 300 mg QD vs. ATV/RTV 300/100 
mg QD and rifabutin 150 mg every other day vs. rifabutin 300 mg once daily taken alone. COBI 
exposures were generally comparable across treatments except that concentrations were

substantially lower at 18 and 24 h following co-administration with rifabutin (see C tau and t 1/2 in 
table 6). 
Table 6.  GS-US-216-0123: Summary of cobicistat PK parameters (analysis set: cobicistat PK) 
The RTV AUCtau and Cmax values (10,947 ng•h/mL and 2191 ng/mL, respectively) were 
comparable to values observed with ATV/RTV dosing in GS-US-183-0106 and GS-US-183-0108. 
Rosuvastatin Cmax and AUC were greater (89% and 38%, respectively) following EVG/COBI co-
administration, but the overall concentration-time profile (and t 1/2) was similar relative to ROS 
dosing alone. The applicant considered that this interaction did not require dose adjustment. 
The ATV AUCtau was lower (10-12%) when given with EVG/COBI vs. ATV/RTV. C max was ~ 21-
24% lower and Ctau was ~ 20-35% lower, although Ctau was well above the DHHS-
recommended target (140 ng/mL) in all subjects. 
The AUCtau, Cmax and Ctau rifabutin were comparable between the EVG/COBI + rifabutin 150 
mg dose and 300 mg given alone. The median T½ was 11.7 h when rifabutin was given alone 
but was 28.6 h following concomitant administration. In contrast, co-administration with 
EVG/COBI resulted in large increases in AUCtau, Cmax and Ctau of 25-O-desacetylrifabutin vs. 
rifabutin alone. [The AUC tau of 25-O-desacetylrifabutin after administration alone was doubled 
for the comparison because of the different dosing frequencies]. The applicant estimated that 
antimycobacterial activity was unaffected by co-administration (ratio 120.9 [107, 136]). 
GS-US-216-0125 evaluated once-daily EVG/co given with methadone or 
buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP/NLX). Eligible subjects were assigned to a cohort based on their 
chronic regimen for opioid use (i.e. Cohort 1–methadone; Cohort 2- BUP/NLX) and received 
their dose with and without EVG 150 mg + COBI 150 mg once daily in the morning with a light 
meal. COBI PK parameters were comparable between treatments and with historical data with 
QUAD STR.  
The 90% CI around the GLSMs for R- and S-methadone fell within 80, 125% for both AUC and 
Cmax. Inhibition of CYP3A4 by COBI would not be expected to significantly influence methadone 
exposures and the comparable exposures of both methadone enantiomers observed in the 
presence or absence of EVG/co confirm there is no inductive effect on CYP2B6 and/or CYP2C19.  
The primary comparison for BUP was co-administration vs. dosing alone, with each subject 
serving as their own control. BUP exposures were higher following co-administration with 
EVG/co. Plasma concentrations of norBUP were also higher following co-administration with 
EVG/co while Tmax values were comparable. NLX plasma concentrations were slightly higher 
Assessment report  
Page 35/86 
 
 
 
  
  
 
when given as BUP/NLX alone vs. co-administration with EVG/co. Consistent with the short 
T1/2, plasma concentrations of NLX in both treatments were BLQ at 24 hours post-dose. 
Inhibition of CYP3A4 by COBI gave a modest increase in the BUP and norBUP (~2% as potent 
as parent compound), which is in line with the change expected when CYP3A does not have a 
predominant role in drug elimination. The BUP and norBUP exposures observed following 
BUP/NLX administration alone were in the range of historical data.  
The reasons for the decrease in NLX exposures, which showed intersubject variability, were 
unclear. The range of NLX exposures across both treatments were comparable with those 
reported on dosing with BUP/NLX alone or in combination with ARVs. The totality of the data 
indicates there is no clinically relevant influence of EVG/co administration on the PK or PD of 
BUP/NLX. This is consistent with previous ARV-opioid DDI studies where a modest change in 
drug levels is not accompanied by a measurable change in pharmacodynamic endpoint.  
Opioid PD was assessed using the standardized tests SOWS, OOWS, COWS, and OOAS daily 
prior to the morning dosing. The resulting scores observed were minimal in all treatments 
relative to the overall test score range. There were no meaningful changes in opioid 
pharmacodynamics and no subjects experienced withdrawal or overdose symptoms.

Comment on pharmacokinetics 
The applicant conducted a comprehensive investigation of the PK of COBI, including an 
evaluation of its ability to act as a pharmaco-enhancer of ATV and DRV. 
Following oral administration of cobicistat with food in HIV 1 infected subjects, peak plasma 
concentrations were observed 4 hours post-dose for cobicistat.  The steady-state mean Cmax, 
AUCtau, and Ctrough (mean ± SD) following multiple doses of cobicistat in HIV 1 infected subjects 
(n = 68), respectively, were 1.2 ± 0.3 μg/mL, 10.9 ± 3.8 μg•hr/mL, and 0.07 ± 0.07 μg/mL. 
Cobicistat displayed both dose- and time-dependent changes in apparent clearance (CL/F) with 
nonlinear increases in systemic exposure. 
A food effect study was not conducted for cobicistat.  Since in clinical studies, cobicistat was co 
administered with atazanavir or darunavir under fed conditions, in accordance with the SmPCs 
for these medicinal products, it is recommended to administer it with food. 
Cobicistat is 97-98% bound to human plasma proteins. The blood-to-plasma ratio of total 14C-
radioactivity was time-independent and ~ 0.5, indicating that COBI is excluded from the 
cellular components of the blood. 
In-vitro studies showed that COBI is extensively metabolised via CYP3A (major) and CYP2D6 
(minor) mediated oxidation with no evidence of direct Phase 2 metabolism. There are no unique 
or major (>10%) human metabolites. Primary metabolites include isopropyl oxidation (M31), 
cleavage at the N-methylurea (M26), cleavage of the carbamate (M21) and cleavage and 
deethylation of the morpholine (M39). 
Following oral administration of [14C]cobicistat, 86% and 8.2% of the dose were recovered in 
faeces and urine, respectively.  The median terminal plasma half-life of cobicistat following 
administration of Tybost is approximately 3-4 hours. 
It is possible that cobicistat is eliminated by CYP3A4 but there are no convincing data to 
support this assumption. As a post authorisation measure (see RMP section 2.8), the applicant 
should identify the major mode of elimination of cobicistat and which enzymes/transporters are 
involved. The applicant should carry out physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) 
simulations of the effect of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors on COBI exposure. If the PBPK simulations 
are inconclusive or if they indicate that another enzyme or a transporter is likely involved in the 
Assessment report  
Page 37/86 
 
 
  
  
 
elimination of COBI, studies should be performed in vitro and in vivo to characterise the 
enzymes/proteins involved. 
Based on the results from study GS-US-216-0124 conducted in non HIV 1 infected subjects 
with severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min), no meaningful 
differences in cobicistat pharmacokinetics were observed between subjects with severe renal 
impairment and healthy subjects, consistent with low renal clearance of cobicistat.  
Cobicistat is primarily metabolised and eliminated by the liver.  In study GS-US-183-0133 in 
non HIV 1 infected subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, no clinically relevant differences 
in cobicistat pharmacokinetics were observed between subjects with moderate impairment and 
healthy subjects.  Hence, no dose adjustment of COBI is necessary for patients with mild to 
moderate hepatic impairment. Since COBI is primarily metabolized in and eliminated by the 
liver and that COBI has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child 
Pugh Class C), the use of COBI in this population is contraindicated. 
Drug drug interaction studies were conducted and their conclusions are adequately reflected in 
the SmPC. 
COBI inhibits human CYP3A with kinact 0.47 min-1 and KI 1.1 μM. These values are 
comparable to those for RTV. On this basis COBI is expected to substantially increase the 
systemic levels of co-administered drugs whose bioavailability and elimination are affected by 
CYP3A enzymes (e.g. MDZ) and co-administration of COBI with these drugs has been 
contraindicated. 
Inducers of CYP3A are expected to lower COBI exposures. Inhibitors of CYP3A are expected to 
increase COBI exposures. Co-administration of COBI with strong inducers of CYP3A has been 
contraindicated while co-administration with other inducers (e.g. EFV) is not recommended. 
In the EVG+COBI (150/150 mg) study GS-US-201-0104 co-administration with 800 mg QD 
DRV gave plasma levels of all three agents that were lower than observed in other studies. 
Hence, COBI co-administered with ATV or DRV should not be used in combination with another 
antiretroviral agent that requires pharmacoenhancement by means of co-administration with an 
inhibitor of CYP3A4 to reach the desired therapeutic plasma concentrations (i.e., another 
protease inhibitor or elvitegravir). 
Data from GS-US-216-0112 demonstrated that the peak concentration of digoxin is increased 
when co-administered with COBI. Hence, the lowest dose of digoxin should initially be 
prescribed. The serum digoxin concentrations should be monitored and used for titration of 
digoxin dose to obtain the desired clinical effects. 
Taking into account the perceived implications for patient management and data from GS-US-
216-0123, it was concluded that co-administration of COBI with the CYP3A substrate and 
inducer rifabutin should not be contraindicated. If co-administration is deemed necessary then 
the recommended dose of rifabutin is 150 mg 3 times per week on set days accompanied by 
increased monitoring for rifabutin-associated adverse reactions (including neutropenia and 
uveitis) due to the increase in exposure to desacetylrifabutin. 
Data from GS-US-216-0125 demonstrated that no dosage adjustement was necessary for the 
co administration of COBI with Buprenorphine/Naloxone.

No data are available to make recommendations on the use of atazanavir/cobicistat or 
darunavir/cobicistat with combined or progestogen-only oral or implanted contraceptives.  
Therefore, alternative forms of contraception should be used. Study GS-US-236-0128, which is 
being conducted in HIV-1 infected subjects, will further inform on the drug interaction profile 
observed in healthy subjects administered STB and norgestimate/ethinyl oestradiol in Study 
GS-US-236-0106. The effect of COBI inhibition of CYP3A on the PK of commonly used oral 
contraceptives will be evaluated and the results will be submitted (see RMP section 2.8). 
As a post authorisation measures, the applicant should also provide the CSRs for the planned 
DDI study with COBI and rifabutin, the DDI with telaprevir (see RMP section 2.8).  
COBI does not inhibit human CYP1A2, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19. It is a very weak inhibitor of 
CYP2C8 (IC50 30.1 μM), a weak inhibitor of UGT1A1 (IC50 16.3 µM), a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 
(IC50 9.2 μM) and a modest inhibitor of CYP2B6 (IC50 2.8 μM). These data suggest COBI is a 
more specific inhibitor than RTV, for which IC 50 values include CYP2D6 3.4 μM, CYP2C9 3.9 μM 
and CYP2C8 5.5 μM. 
Human aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) was not induced by COBI or the three human 
metabolites tested, with findings similar to RTV (fold induction ~0.80). There was very weak 
activation of PXR by COBI and a lesser effect than was observed with RTV (3.6 to 10.1-fold 
across the same concentrations). 
In human hepatocytes COBI showed little potential to induce CYP1A2, 2B6 or 3A at 
concentrations up to 30 µM. Other targets for induction (UGT1A1 mRNA, MDR1 mRNA, and 
CYP2B6 mRNA and protein) were all unaffected or weakly affected by COBI. 
At human plasma concentrations following 150 mg doses, COBI would not be expected to 
inhibit the efflux transporters MDR1 (P gp), multi-drug resistance associated proteins 2 and 4 
(MRP2 and MRP4, respectively), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and multidrug and 
toxin extrusion protein 2-K (MATE2-K) and the renal uptake transporters, organic anion 
transporters 1 and 3 (OAT1 and OAT3). 
At concentrations achievable briefly in the intestinal lumen during absorption ([I]2 = 770 μM) 
COBI is expected to inhibit intestinal efflux transporters such as MDR1 and BCRP ([I]2/IC50 > 
10). On this basis COBI may modestly increase exposures of substrates of P-gp. In addition, 
high concentrations of COBI in the intestinal lumen during absorption can increase systemic 
TFV exposure due to inhibition of P-gp-dependent efflux of TDF. 
Cobicistat is a more potent inhibitor of the uptake transporters, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 (IC50 
values 3.5 μM and 1.88 μM, respectively), and organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2; IC50 8.24 
μM).  It also inhibits the renal efflux transporters, novel organic cation transporter 1 (OCTN1; 
IC50 2.49 μM) and multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1 (MATE1; IC50 1.87 μM).  Inhibition of 
OCT2 and/or MATE1, and thus inhibition of active secretion of creatinine by the kidney, 
provides a plausible mechanistic explanation for the reduction in creatinine clearance observed 
with COBI, in the absence of changes of true GFR. 
Co-administration of COBI with ATV or DRV: 
Atazanavir is an inhibitor of CYP2C8, but this effect is reduced when it is given with RTV, likely 
due to induction of CYP2C8 by RTV. Since COBI is not an inducer, the inhibitory effect of the 
combination of ATV + COBI on CYP2C8 will most likely resemble that for unboosted ATV.  
Assessment report  
Page 39/86 
 
  
  
 
COBI is considered to be a weak inhibitor of UGT1A1 with IC50 16.3 µM (vs. 4.7 for RTV and 
0.83 for ATV) and is not expected to affect substrates of UGT1A1. 
COBI can be transported by OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 but it shows good passive cellular 
permeability, so tissue penetration is unlikely to be dependent on OATP activity. This was 
supported by the lack of effect of ATV (a potent OATP1B1 inhibitor) on COBI plasma exposures.  
Darunavir can inhibit CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6. Darunavir is an inducer in vitro and the 
combination of DRV+COBI may result in drug-drug interactions due to induction by DRV but no 
additive effect from COBI is expected. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Cobicistat is intended for pharmaco-enhancement of two HIV protease inhibitors (atazanavir 
and darunavir) as a replacement for low dose ritonavir. The primary pharmacology concerns 
the effects of COBI on cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, specifically on CYP3A4. COBI has been 
investigated for any potential direct antiviral activity. In addition, the potential for COBI to 
exert secondary pharmacological effects on adipocyte, cardiac and renal functions has been 
investigated. 
Mechanism of action 
Cobicistat is an inhibitor of human CYP3A enzyme activity. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
CYP3A inhibition studies vs. RTV in human hepatic microsomes included established markers for 
activities of CYP3A enzymes as well as ATV, EVG and telaprevir. COBI was shown to be a strong 
inhibitor of all tested human hepatic microsomal CYP3A activities. The IC50 values for COBI and 
RTV were closely comparable. Kinetic parameters for COBI (kinact = 0.47 min-1, KI = 1.1 μM) 
were comparable to those of RTV (kinact = 0.23 min−1, KI = 0.26 μM). 
The COBI IC50 for CYP2B6 was comparable with that for RTV while that for CYP2D6 was higher 
than for RTV. 
PK/PD relationships for efficacy 
The PK-PD relationship of COBI for anti-CYP3A activity was explored in the studies that 
assessed the effects of co-administration of COBI and each of MDZ, ATV, DRV and EVG (GS-
US-216-0101 and GS-US-216-0116). Across these studies the effects of COBI on oral MDZ 
were assessed at four dose levels (from 50 mg to 200 mg) and compared with the effect of 100 
mg RTV. The applicant concluded that COBI can inhibit CYP3A-mediated metabolism of MDZ to 
an extent comparable with RTV as reported in the literature. 
The effectiveness of COBI as a booster for ATV was assessed in Phase 1 and during the Phase 2 
and Phase 3 studies that compared ATV/co+TVD with ATV/r+TVD in treatment-naive subjects 
(see the section on Efficacy). Pharmacokinetic parameters of ATV were determined following 
multiple-dose administration in a subset of these HIV-1 infected subjects. The pooled ATV 
Assessment report  
Page 40/86 
 
 
  
  
 
Ctrough values (756 and 847 ng/mL, respectively) were 54-fold and 61-fold above the IC90 
(14 ng/mL) and were also consistent with historical data for ATV. 
The assessment of the effectiveness of COBI as a booster for DRV was based primarily on data 
from the Phase 1 study GS-US-216-0115 which compared once daily DRV/RTV 800/100 mg 
with DRV/COBI 800/150 mg when each was dosed for 10 days in the fed state. The mean COBI 
Cmax (1375.7 ng/mL) occurred at a median of 3.5 h while mean AUCtau was 10,370 ng.h/mL. 
Healthy subjects were dosed with each of DRV/co or DRV/r for 10 days in the fed state in a 
cross-over study design. 
The mean COBI Cmax, median Tmax and mean AUCtau values were comparable with those 
reported from other studies with COBI given alone at this dose (e.g. GS-US-216-0110). 
The DRV mean Cmax, Tmax, and AUCtau values were comparable but T1/2 was shorter on co-
administration with COBI vs. RTV (8.29 vs. 13.79 h). There was an increase in DRV 
concentrations at 24 h in the RTV group that gave a higher Ctau (observed at end of dosing 
interval) compared to the COBI group, resulting in the difference observed (see table 8). In 
contrast, DRV C0 (pre-dose) values were comparable and were > 37-fold the protein-adjusted 
EC50 for wild-type virus (55 ng/mL). 
Comparable peak-to-trough variability was seen for DRV irrespective of whether the boosting 
agent was COBI (mean [SD] 1.99 [0.446]) or RTV (1.81 [0.512]). Differences in swing were 
noted when DRV was boosted with COBI (mean [SD], 8.12 [8.735]) compared with RTV (4.60 
[3.574]). The applicant stated that the lower swing with RTV may be attributed to the increase 
in DRV trough as mentioned above.

testing showing no darunavir RAMs] had indicated no relevant relationship between DRV AUC24h 
or C 0h and efficacy. 
In light of the results of GS-US-216-0115 the applicant performed additional PK/PD analyses 
from the Phase 3 studies of DRV/RTV 800/100 mg in HIV-1 infected subjects that modelled 
relationships between virological response and DRV PK parameters. The comparison of DRV/co 
and DRV/r PK data between those studies indicated closely comparable AUC24 and C 0h values. 
The results gave no indication that lower values within the observed DRV C 0h range would led to 
lower estimated virological response. A linear logistic regression model was also applied to 
model virological response as a function of DRV C 0h but no clear relationship could be 
established. 
Taking into account the PK/PD data, the difference in Ctau between DRV/co and DRV/r were not 
considered to be of clinical importance. 
Additional relevant efficacy data was provided with the study GS US 216 0130, which is a single 
arm study of DRV/co+2 fully active NRTIs (see Section on Efficacy). Overall 60 subjects (57 
treatment-naive) were included in PK sub-study, of which 59 were receiving TVD as a 
background regimen. Overall, the PK exposure parameters of DRV, COBI, FTC and TFV were 
consistent with historical data. 
The sub-study data were used to develop the population PK model of COBI-boosted DRV. The 
final population PK model was used for the Bayesian feedback analysis for all study subjects 
with evaluable PK data through Week 24 (n = 298). 
The population PK-based DRV AUC and trough concentration (C 0h) in GS-US-216-0130 and in 
the DRV/r studies (ODIN and ARTEMIS) are compared in Table 9. The mean DRV trough 
concentrations were > 37-fold above the protein-binding adjusted EC50 for wild-type virus 
(55 ng/mL) and > 3.7-fold above the protein-binding adjusted EC50 for PI resistant HIV-1 
strains (550 ng/mL), indicating adequate PK enhancement (boosting) of DRV by COBI.

PK/PD relationship for safety parameters 
PK/PD analyses of the COBI exposure-safety relationship were performed using data from the 
ATV/COBI+TVD groups in the Phase 2 and 3 studies. COBI exposures were derived from 
population PK modeling. The safety parameters studied were commonly observed AEs including 
bilirubin-related AEs (jaundice, ocular icterus, hyperbilirubinaemia or blood bilirubin increased), 
nausea or diarrhoea. The relationships observed between COBI exposures (AUCtau or Cmax) and 
incidence of AEs (present/absent) indicated that there were no relevant exposure-AE trends. 
Assessment report  
Page 42/86 
 
 
 
  
  
 
Exploratory analyses were also performed using COBI exposures derived from population PK 
modeling and any of Grade 3 or 4 total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), serum creatinine, eGFRCG and urine fractional excretion of phosphate. 
No convincing relationships were detected between COBI exposure (AUCtau or Cmax) quartiles 
and changes from baseline in these laboratory parameters.  
No apparent relationships were observed between DRV AUC24h and C 0h and the occurrence of 
selected AEs of interest (rashes, cardiac AEs, gastrointestinal or liver AEs, lipid or 
glucose-related AEs, nervous system or psychiatric AEs) following administration of DRV/r 
800/100 mg once daily in ARTEMIS or ODIN.  
Since COBI exposures (AUCtau and Cmax) documented in GS-US-216-0105 and 
GS-US-216-0114 were in the range observed with DRV/COBI 800/150 mg in GS-US-216-0115, 
the COBI exposure-safety relationship is expected to be comparable when used with ATV or 
DRV. 
Secondary pharmacology 
Antiviral activity 
Cobicistat is a structural analogue of ritonavir and was fully assessed for any possible anti-viral 
activity in vitro. COBI is devoid of anti-HIV activity (HIV protease IC50 > 30 μM) and exhibited 
no antiviral activity against 17 HIV-1 and 2 HIV-2 primary isolates. COBI was also inactive 
against HBV (EC50 > 12.5 μM) and HCV (EC50 > 30 μM).  
Adipocyte function 
COBI exhibited no effect on lipid accumulation and had a less pronounced effect than RTV on 
glucose uptake. 
Cardiac and renal functions 
There were three clinical studies of effects of COBI on QTc, on left ventricular function and on 
renal function (GS-US-216-0107, GS-US-216-0116, GS-US-216-0121). Each study collected PK 
data. One additional study with COBI (as a single-agent tablet) is ongoing (GS-US-236-0118). 
This is a Phase 3 study of effects of COBI-containing regimens on renal parameters in HIV-1 
infected subjects with mild to moderate renal impairment. 
GS-US-216-0107 was a cross-over study that evaluated the effect of two doses of COBI, each 
administered once in the fed state on QTc. Subjects received each of COBI 250 mg, COBI 400 
mg, placebo and moxifloxacin 400 mg at weekly intervals. The plasma levels of COBI actually 
achieved exceeded the predicted values. Assay sensitivity was established based on the 
differences between controls. COBI did not show prolongation of the QTcF interval. At these 
doses the PR interval difference vs. placebo reached a maximum of 9.6 ms at 250 mg and 20 
ms at 400 mg at times that correlated with C max. However the plasma concentrations at which 
these effects occurred were considerably higher than Cmax values using 150 mg COBI (2169 
and 3823 ng/mL vs. approximately 1125-1460 ng/mL at 150 mg doses). 
GS-US-216-0116 included collection of ECGs and echocardiograms at baseline and at 3.5-6 h 
post-dose on one occasion between days 14-19 of dosing with 150 mg COBI daily. All subjects 
Assessment report  
Page 43/86 
 
  
  
 
had normal absolute PR (< 210 ms) and QTcF (< 450 ms) intervals. The ECHO assessments 
showed that the three measures of left ventricular function were normal.  
GS-US-126-0121 evaluated the effect of COBI and RTV in normal function (cohort 1) or 
mild/moderate renal impairment (cohort 2). On day 7 higher COBI exposures (AUCtau, Cmax, 
and Ctau) were observed in cohort 2. Mean AUCtau was moderately higher, mean Cmax was 
slightly higher, and mean Ctau was considerably higher in cohort 2. Median T½ was longer and 
mean CL/F was reduced in Cohort 2. The differences in COBI exposures between Cohorts 1 and 
2 observed in this study were unexpected based on the findings of GS-US-216-0124 in subjects 
with eGFRCG < 30 mL/min and the mass balance study GS-US-216-0111. The applicant 
considered that the higher plasma exposures in Cohort 2 may reflect the change in clearance 
with or without any increase in bioavailability. 
Serum creatinine-based GFR estimations were statistically significantly decreased (p < 0.05) on 
Day 7 of COBI administration in both cohorts but not at Day 14. The eGFRMDRD and mGFR 
gave similar results to those based on serum creatinine eGFR. In contrast, the aGFR was 
unchanged from baseline at Day 7 and 14 in the COBI. There were also no statistically 
significant changes from baseline at Day 7 or Day 14 in cysGFR. 
Additional information emerged from the study GS-US-236-0130 (Phase 3b, single-arm, open-
label safety and efficacy study in HIV-1 infected ARV treatment-naive and treatment-
experienced adults with no DRV RAMs - see Section on Clinical Efficacy 2.5). In this study, 
mean plasma concentrations of COBI when given alone were similar to those for subjects 
receiving COBI+TDF and slightly lower vs. dosing with STB. There was the expected effect on 
eGFR for COBI-containing regimens. 
The on-treatment (Day 15 and Day 30) aGFR (Iohexol Plasma Clearance) data showed 
decreases from baseline and vs. placebo for COBI alone and for COBI+TDF. The 90% CI around 
ratios vs. placebo did not fall within 80, 125% except for COBI+TDF at day 15. Similar analyses 
based on Day 15 and 30 vs. D0 within each treatment group gave 90% CI around the ratios 
that just fell within 80, 125% except for Day 15 in the COBI group. The study could not rule 
out the possibility that COBI alone does have a small effect of aGFR but the effect of co-
administration of COBI+TDF was not consistently greater than the effect of COBI alone (or TDF 
alone). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
COBI was shown to be a strong inhibitor of all tested human hepatic microsomal CYP3A 
activities. The IC 50 values for COBI and RTV were closely comparable. Cobicistat is a structural 
analogue of ritonavir and is not expected to exert an antiviral effect at clinically achievable 
concentrations. 
Cobicistat is a weak CYP2D6 inhibitor and is metabolised to a minor extent by CYP2D6.  
Cobicistat inhibits the transporters p glycoprotein (P gp), BCRP, MATE1, OATP1B1 and 
OATP1B3.  Unlike ritonavir, cobicistat is not an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19 or UGT1A1.  
COBI is expected to weakly-modestly increase exposures of substrates of MATE1 and 
OATP1B1/3. Inhibition of OCT2 and MATE1 is associated with disrupted active renal secretion of 
Assessment report

creatinine, resulting in a reduction in creatinine clearance in the absence of changes in true 
GFR. The potential for a reduction in creatinine clearance is adequately reflected in the SmPC 
and no further action is considered necessary by the CHMP. 
The effectiveness of COBI as a booster for ATV was assessed in treatment-naive subjects. The 
pooled ATV Ctrough values were consistent with historical data for ATV. 
The assessment of the effectiveness of COBI as a booster for DRV was based primarily on data 
from the Phase 1 study GS-US-216-0115. GS-US-216-0115 demonstrated bioequivalent 
exposures for DRV assessed based on AUCtau, Cmax and C 0h, while C tau was ~ 30% lower with 
DRV/COBI vs. DRV/RTV. The difference in Ctau between DRV/co and DRV/r could not be 
explained. However, it is not expected to be of clinical relevance provided that the use of 
DRV/co is entirely restricted to the DRV once daily regimen. 
In light of the results of GS-US-216-0115 the applicant performed additional PK/PD analyses 
from the Phase 3 studies of DRV/RTV 800/100 mg in HIV-1 infected subjects that modelled 
relationships between virological response and DRV PK parameters. The comparison of DRV/co 
and DRV/r PK data between those studies indicated closely comparable AUC24 and C0h values. 
The results gave no indication that lower values within the observed DRV C0h range would led 
to lower estimated virological response. A linear logistic regression model was also applied to 
model virological response as a function of DRV C0h but no clear relationship could be 
established. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Cobicistat is a selective, mechanism-based inhibitor of cytochromes P450 of the CYP3A 
subfamily.  Inhibition of CYP3A-mediated metabolism by cobicistat enhances the systemic 
exposure of CYP3A substrates (such as atazanavir or darunavir) that have limited oral 
bioavailability and a short half-life due to CYP3A-dependent metabolism. 
Cobicistat has no detectable antiviral activity against HIV-1, HBV or HCV and does not 
antagonise the antiviral effect of HIV inhibitors. 
The effectiveness of COBI as a booster for ATV was assessed in treatment-naive subjects. The 
pooled ATV Ctrough values were consistent with historical data for ATV. 
Bioequivalent exposures for DRV was demonstrated based on AUCtau, Cmax and C 0h; however, 
Ctau was ~ 30% lower with DRV/COBI vs. DRV/RTV. Based on PK/PD analyses, it was concluded 
that the lower Ctau observed with DRV/COBI compared with DRV/RTV in GS US 216 0115 would 
not result in a difference in virological response between the two once daily regimens provided 
that the use of DRV/co is entirely restricted to the DRV once daily regimen. 
In the setting of boosting ATV or DRV, COBI 150 mg has the possibility of resulting in a slightly 
smaller range of potential DDIs vs. RTV 100 mg. Drug drug interaction studies were conducted 
and their conclusions are adequately reflected in the SmPC. As a post authorisation measures, 
the applicant should provide the CSRs for the planned DDI study with COBI and rifabutin, the 
DDI with telaprevir and the study with QUAD STB in women (see RMP section 2.8).

2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
The applicant selected the dose of COBI (150 mg) based on GS-US-216-0110 and GS-US-216-
0115 in which the effect of COBI on PK of ATV and DRV was evaluated. 
GS-US-216-0110 showed comparable ATV AUC tau, C max and Ctau as well as Tmax and t 1/2 on 
daily dosing with ATV/COBI 300/150 mg vs. ATV/RTV 300/100 mg. ATV with 100 mg COBI 
gave lower ATV exposures (15-20%) and a shorter T1/2 vs. ATV/RTV. Greater than dose-
proportional increases in COBI exposures were observed at 150 mg vs. 100 mg. 
GS-US-216-0115 compared once daily DRV/RTV 800/100 mg with DRV/COBI 800/150 mg 
when each was dosed for 10 days in the fed state (see Section on Pharmacodynamics 2.4).  
2.5.2.  Main study (GS-US-216-0114) 
GS-US-216-0114 is the single pivotal efficacy study conducted in treatment-naïve HIV-infected 
subjects that directly compared ATV/RTV and ATV/COBI, each given with Truvada 
(emtricitabine and tenofovir).

Study Participants 
Critical inclusion criteria were: 
•  Plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥ 5000 copies/mL 
Assessment report  
Page 47/86 
 
 
  
  
 
•  No prior use of any approved or investigational antiretroviral drug for any length of time 
•  Screening HIV-1 genotype report must have shown sensitivity to FTC, TDF and ATV  
•  Normal ECG 
•  Adequate renal function: CG formula GFR ≥ 70 mL/min  
•  AST and ALT ≤ 5 × ULN, total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL or normal direct bilirubin, absolute 
neutrophil count ≥ 1000/mm3; platelets ≥ 50,000/mm3; haemoglobin ≥ 8.5 g/dL; serum 
amylase ≤ 5 × ULN (or if amylase > 5 × ULN, serum lipase was to be ≤ 5 × ULN) 
Critical exclusion criteria were: 
•  A new AIDS-defining condition diagnosed within 30 days prior to screening  
•  On treatment for HCV or anticipated to need treatment during the course of the study 
Treatments 
During the randomised, double-blind phase all treatment was administered once daily with food 
and at approximately the same time each day as follows: 
Treatment Group 1: 
•  COBI (1 x 150-mg tablet) + ATV (1 x 300-mg capsule) + TVD (FTC/TDF 200/300 mg; 1 x 
tablet)  
•  RTV placebo (1 x 100 mg tablet) 
Treatment Group 2: 
•  RTV (1 x 100-mg tablet) + ATV (1 x 300-mg capsule) + TVD (FTC/TDF 200/300 mg; 1 x 
tablet)  
•  COBI placebo (1 x 150-mg tablet) 
Objectives 
Primary objective: 
•  To evaluate the efficacy of a regimen containing ATV/COBI versus ATV/RTV, each 
administered with TVD, in HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral treatment-naive adult subjects as 
determined by the achievement of HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) < 50 copies/mL at Week 
48 
Secondary objective: 
•  To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the 2 treatment regimens through 96 
weeks of treatment 
Outcomes/endpoints 
•  HIV-1 RNA in plasma was measured using the COBAS Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor Test 
(Version 1.5).  
Assessment report  
Page 48/86 
 
  
  
 
•  At screening, the PR/RT genotype was assessed using the GeneSeq™ assay (Monogram 
Biosciences, South San Francisco, CA). This assay also determined the HIV-1 subtype.  
•  Post-baseline resistance analyses of viruses obtained from subjects with virological failure 
or failure to achieve plasma HIV-1 RNA < 400 copies at study discontinuation (at or after 
Week 8 and on study drugs) included PR/RT genotyping and phenotyping. The PhenoSense 
GT™ (PhenoSense IN) and GeneSeq IN assays (Monogram Biosciences, South San 
Francisco, CA) were used for this purpose. 
•  CD4 counts were assessed using flow cytometry. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL 
at Week 48 as defined by the FDA snapshot analysis algorithm. Non-inferiority of 
ATV/COBI+TVD relative to ATV/RTV+TVD was assessed using 95% CI with a pre-defined non-
inferiority margin of 12%.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints were as follows: 
•  The percentage of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 96, as defined by the 
snapshot analysis algorithm 
•  The achievement and maintenance of confirmed HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL through 
Weeks 48 and 96, as defined by TLOVR 
Sample size 
A sample size of 700 HIV-1 infected subjects (randomised 1:1) had at least 95% power to 
establish non-inferiority with respect to the primary efficacy endpoint. It was assumed that 
both treatment groups would have a response rate of 0.795 (based on GS-01-934), that the 
non-inferiority margin was 0.12, and that the significance level of the test was at a 1-sided, 
0.025 level. 
Randomisation 
Randomisation was by IVRS stratified according to HIV-1 RNA ≤ 100,000 or > 100,000 
copies/ml. 
Blinding (masking) 
The IVRS/IWRS assigned blinded study drug bottle numbers at each study visit (except Week 
2). Study drug (COBI/RTV and matching placebos) was dispensed to subjects in a blinded 
fashion. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis populations for efficacy analyses were defined as follows: 
•  Randomised Analysis Set - all randomised subjects (added for analysis in the SAP).  
• 
Intent-to-Treat Analysis Set - all randomised who received at least 1 dose of study drug. 
This was the primary analysis set for efficacy analyses.  
Assessment report  
Page 49/86 
 
  
  
 
•  Per Protocol Analysis Set –all randomised and treated (grouped by actual treatment 
received) with no major protocol violation. This was the secondary analysis set for the 
primary endpoint.  
Primary Analysis 
The Week 48 interim analysis was conducted after all randomised subjects either completed 
their Week 48 study visit or prematurely discontinued study drugs before their Week 48 visit.  
The non-inferiority evaluation of proportions that achieved HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 
48 (FDA-defined snapshot approach) was the pre-specified primary comparison.  
There were two interim IDMC analyses performed at Weeks 12 and 24 in which data were 
provided with treatment groups coded as A and B. IDMC members did not request decodes 
prior to Week 48. However, as a consequence of the interim IDMC analyses, the alpha level for 
the Week 48 analysis was adjusted to 0.048. The sponsor did not have a prior intent to ask the 
IDMC to consider early termination of the study even if there was early evidence of favourable 
efficacy. Since there was no intent to stop the study early, the Haybittle procedure was used as 
a stopping rule. An alpha penalty of 0.001 was applied for each interim analysis performed by 
the IDMC. Therefore, for the primary endpoint analysis, a 95.2% CI (corresponding to an alpha 
level of 0.048) was constructed to preserve the overall alpha level of 0.05. As such, the primary 
analysis CI is described as a 95% CI. 
Snapshot Analysis Algorithm 
In the snapshot analysis for the Week 48 virological outcome the following definitions applied: 
- Virological Success: last available HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL in the Week 48 analysis window 
- Virological Failure: last available HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL in the Week 48 analysis window 
OR did not have on-treatment HIV-1 RNA data in the Week 48 analysis window due to either 
of: 
1.  discontinuation of study drug for lack of efficacy 
2.  discontinuation of study drug for reasons other than an AE, death or lack of efficacy 
AND last available HIV-1 RNA value on treatment was ≥ 50 copies/mL 
- No Virological Data in the Week 48 analysis window: no on-treatment HIV-1 RNA data in the 
Week 48 analysis window because: 
1.  study drug was discontinued due to AE or death (regardless of last available HIV-1 RNA) 
2.  study drug was discontinued due to reasons other than AE/death and lack of efficacy and 
the last available HIV-1 RNA value on treatment was < 50 copies/mL 
3.  missing data during the window but remained on study drug 
The baseline HIV-1 RNA stratum (≤ 100,000 copies/mL or > 100,000 copies/mL])-weighted 
difference in the response rate (P1 – P2) and its 95% CI were calculated based on stratum-
adjusted Mantel-Haenszel (MH) proportion. 
Secondary and Sensitivity Analyses for the Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
Assessment report  
Page 50/86 
 
  
  
 
In addition to the analysis based on the PP population a series of sensitivity analyses were 
performed using the ITT population as follows: 
•  Subjects who had no HIV-1 RNA data in the Week 48 analysis window due to study drug 
discontinuation for reasons other than lack of efficacy, AEs or death and whose last 
available on-treatment HIV-1 RNA value was < 50 copies/mL were excluded from the 
numerator and denominator in the response rate computation. Additionally, for late 
discontinuation (i.e. discontinuation of study drug due to reasons other than death in the 
Week 48 analysis window) all the HIV-1 RNA data in the Week 48 analysis window 
including data collected after the last dose of study drug were included in the evaluation of 
virological response per the FDA-defined snapshot algorithm. 
•  Subjects who had no HIV-1 RNA data in the Week 48 analysis window due to study drug 
discontinuation for reasons other than lack of efficacy, AEs or death and whose last 
available on-treatment HIV-1 RNA value was < 50 copies/mL were counted in the 
virological success category. HIV-1 RNA data collected after the last dose of study drug for 
late discontinuation were handled in the same way as in the first sensitivity analysis. 
•  The following analyses were performed for the primary endpoint: (1) stratifying by region 
and (2) without any stratification factors. The results were compared with the primary 
analysis (i.e. stratified by baseline HIV-1 RNA level). The stratified CMH analyses were 
used to estimate the odds ratio, the corresponding 95% CI, and to obtain p-values. A 
region was defined as multiple sites combined based on sites from the neighbouring 
counties states in the US. 
TLOVR Algorithm 
The outcome variable for the achievement and maintenance of confirmed HIV-1 RNA < 50 
copies/mL through Week 48 (responder) was derived using all available HIV-1 RNA data 
(including unscheduled data, post-Week 48 data, and 30-day follow-up data), based on the 
FDA-defined TLOVR algorithm. 
Results 
Participant flow 
At week 48 698 subjects were enrolled, including 692 who received at least one dose of study 
medication, at 143 sites in 18 countries. Up to the data cut-off 12.9% had discontinued study 
drug (14.5% ATV/COBI and 11.2% ATV/RTV) while 7.9% had discontinued from the study 
(9.9% vs. 6%, respectively) the most common reasons being AEs and LTFU in both treatment 
groups.

Figure 2 GS-US-216-0114: Disposition of study subjects– 48 weeks analysis 
In the 96 weeks analysis, of the 692 subjects randomised, 20.7% (143; 72 and 71 in the two 
treatment groups) had discontinued study drug prior to the Week 96 analysis cut-off date. The 
most common reasons for premature discontinuation of study drug were AEs (10.2% in the 
ATV/co+TVD group and 10.1% in the ATV/r+TVD group), lost to follow-up (4.1% and 2.3%) 
and investigator’s discretion (2.6% and 2.3%). The median duration of exposure to study drug 
was 108.1 weeks in both groups. 
Recruitment 
The study started on 26 April 2010 (First Subject Screened) and the last subject observation for 
the 48 weeks analysis was 29 November 2011. 
Conduct of the study 
There were three protocol amendments after study initiation and four administrative letters 
were issued. These occurred before unblinding the week 48 dataset but were not of a nature to 
affect the integrity of the study. 
Baseline data 
In general the baseline subject and disease characteristics were comparable between treatment 
groups. The majority of subjects were white (~60%) and male (~83%) aged between 30-40 
years. About 40% had > 100,000 copies/ml at baseline with mean and median values ~ 4.8 
log10 copies/ml. Most subjects had HIV-1 subtype B (82%). Just under half had > 350 CD4 
cells/µl and > 80% were asymptomatic. Few (< 6%) were co-infected with HBV or HCV.

Numbers analysed 
There were 106 important protocol deviations in 88 subjects of which 73 had a single important 
deviation, 12 had two and 3 subjects had 3 deviations. Protocol deviations were proportionally 
distributed between treatment groups and study centres and the majority were due to non-
adherence (< 70% adherence at any visit based on pill count).  
Overall 24 subjects violated a single eligibility criterion of which most were due to CD4 counts 
< 200 cells/μL at the screening visit that were identified after treatment had commenced; these 
subjects did not have any other AIDS-defining condition and were not discontinued. 
Adherence to active study drug, as measured by pill count, was comparable (median 99% per 
group) between groups and 80% and 84% per group had an adherence rate of ≥ 95%. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Results up to Week 48 (primary analysis) 
In the primary analysis at Week 48 non-inferiority was demonstrated for ATV/COBI vs. 
ATV/RTV with a lower bound of the 95% CI at -7.4. In addition, 5.8% and 4.0% in respective 
groups had virological failure while 9.0% and 8.6% had no virological data in the Week 48 
analysis window.

copies/mL, snapshot analysis, ITT analysis set)

Non-inferiority was also demonstrated in the PP analysis set although actual success rates were 
higher (98%; 95% CI were -2.5, 2.3). Sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint showed: 
•  After excluding study drug discontinuations not related to virological response and 
including all HIV-1 RNA data for late discontinuation (ITT analysis set) the success rates 
were 87.5% and 89.4% (95% CI: −6.9% to 2.8%). 
• 
• 
Including study drug discontinuations not related to virological response as successes and 
all HIV-1 RNA data for late discontinuation (ITT analysis set) the rates were 87.8% vs. 
89.7% (95% CI: −6.7% to 2.8%). 
In the third sensitivity analysis Odds ratios were 0.83 (95% CI: 0.54 to 1.28) for baseline 
HIV-1 RNA level and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.52 to 1.26) for region. These were similar to the 
unadjusted odds ratio (0.83, 95% CI 0.54, 1.28), indicating that the treatment effect for 
the primary endpoint was not confounded by these factors. 
Non-inferiority was also demonstrated in the analysis based on TLVOR with < 50 copies/mL in 
82.8% and 85.3% (95% CI -8.1, 2.8). In the KM analysis of TLOVR the percentages were 
comparable between treatment groups with Week 48 rates of 19% and 16% (p=0.44). 
Pure virological failure (PVF; HIV-1 cut-off at 50 copies/mL and premature study drug 
discontinuation by Week 48) occurred in 10.5% (36/344) in the ATV/COBI group and 9.8% 
(34/348) in the ATV/RTV group. 
In each of the Missing=Failure (M=F) analysis and Missing=Excluded (M=E) analysis 
percentages with HIV-1 RNA levels < 50 copies/mL were comparable between treatments and 
the lower bound of the 95% CI fell within -6%. In the corresponding analyses in the PP analysis 
percentages with < 50 copies/mL (M=F) were higher than in the ITT analysis set at 98% in 
each group while the rates when applying M=E were 98.3% and 98%.

Table 13.  GS-US-216-0114: Number and percentage of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 
copies/mL at week 48 (ITT analysis set) 
Mean decreases from baseline in HIV-1 RNA levels were identical between treatment groups at 
Week 48 (-3.08, -3.09). 
Mean increases from baseline in CD4 cell counts were comparable between treatments at Week 
48 at 213 and 219 cells/μL. Mean increases in CD4% were also comparable at 9.7% and 9.8%. 
Subgroup analyses mostly revealed virological success rates (HIV < 50 copies/mL; snapshot 
analysis; ITT) that were numerically higher in the ATV/RTV group. The exceptions were in 
subjects aged > 40 years and in female subjects, where rates were slightly higher for 
ATV/COBI. In subjects with HIV RNA > 100,000 copies/ml at baseline the success rates were 
86.4% for ATV/COBI and 86% for ATV/RTV. For those with CD4 < 350 at baseline rates were 
89.7% and 89.6%, respectively. 
Leaving aside the comparison for the relatively small subgroup with adherence < 95% the 
lower bound of the 95% CI fell within -13% in each case. Only for the subgroup aged < 40 
years and the group with baseline CD4 count > 350 did the lower 95% CI exceed -12% (-
12.3% and -12.8% respectively) and most values were within -10%. 
Homogeneity tests performed for the primary endpoint did not show a significant difference in 
treatment effects between subgroups.

All subjects showed genotypic sensitivity to FTC, TDF and ATV at screening and no subject had 
a K65R or M184V/I RT mutation at study entry. Primary PI-R mutations were observed in 
18/692 (2.6%), most commonly L33F and L90M, but these viruses were considered fully 
sensitive to ATV on their screening report. NRTI resistance (NRTI-R) mutations were observed 
in 8.4% of subjects (58 of 692), most commonly V118I in 36/692 (5.2%). 
There were 24 virological failures included in the Resistance Analysis Population (RAP).  
•  Post-baseline genotypic and phenotypic PR and RT data were available for viruses from 
11/12 subjects in the ATV/COBI group. Two of these viruses developed an RT M184V 
mutation and one had measured phenotypic resistance to FTC. None developed a K65R 
mutation. The remaining 9 viruses lacked emergent resistance mutations in PR and RT and 
remained phenotypically susceptible to all drugs in the assigned regimen. 
•  Post-baseline genotypic and phenotypic PR and RT data were available for viruses from all 
12 subjects in the ATV/RTV group. None of these had emergent resistance to a study drug 
and all remained phenotypically susceptible to TDF, FTC and ATV. 
Results up to Week 96 
At Week 96 a slightly greater proportion of subjects in the ATV/co group had virological failure 
(7.0% [24/344] vs. 4.6% [16/348] for ATV/r) principally because of the greater percentage of 
subjects in the ATV/co group who discontinued study drug due to other reasons whose last 
available HIV-1 RNA was ≥ 50 copies/mL. The percentages with no virological data in the 
Week 96 window were similar (15.1% ATV/co+TVD and 16.1% ATV/r+TVD) and the reasons 
for lack of virological data were balanced between the treatment groups. 
Based on the TLOVR analysis using the Week 96 dataset, 82.8% (285/344) in the ATV/co+TVD 
group and 85.3% (297/348) in the ATV/r+TVD group achieved and maintained confirmed 
HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL through Week 48 and were considered responders. 
The Week 96 mean (SD) increases from baseline in CD4 cell count were 277 (176.8) cells/µL in 
the ATV/co+TVD group and 287 (181.5) cells/µL in the ATV/r+TVD group. The difference in 
least square means (LSM) was -10 (95% CI: −38 to 19).

Supportive studies 
Data in support of the use of ATV/co: GS-US-216-0105  
GS-US-216-0114 is supported by a single Phase 2 study GS-US-216-0105 that was of a similar 
design but in much smaller numbers. 
This US study randomised treatment-naïve subjects (2:1; 50 and 25 per group) to ATV/COBI 
(300/150 mg) or ATV/RTV (300/100 mg), each administered once daily in combination with 
TVD in a double-blind and double dummy design. Randomisation was stratified by HIV-1 RNA 
≤ 100,000 copies/mL or > 100,000 copies/mL at screening. Up to Week 60, subjects continued 
to take their blinded study drugs and attended scheduled visits until treatment assignments 
were unblinded, when they were given the option to participate in an open-label rollover 
extension and receive ATV/COBI+TVD.  
There were 79 randomised and treated subjects (50 ATV/COBI) of which 69 completed study 
treatment in the randomised phase. The demographic and other baseline characteristics were 
comparable between the treatment groups. Subjects were mostly male, with a mean age of 36 
years and no significant differences in baseline viral load, CD4 cell count or CD4 percentage 
between treatment groups. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) baseline HIV-1 RNA value was 
4.61 (0.614) log 10 copies/mL, mean CD4 cell count was 357 (192.2) cells/µL and mean CD4% 
was 22.0 (9.01). Overall, 70.9% of subjects had baseline HIV-1 RNA level ≤ 100,000 
copies/mL. 
The week 24 and 48 HIV RNA data showed that ATV/COBI was not quite as effective as 
ATV/RTV.

Table 15.  GS-US-216-0105: Virologic outcomes at weeks 24 and 48 using snapshot analysis 
and HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL (ITT analysis set) 
Changes in CD4 counts to Weeks 24 and 48 were comparable between groups.  
Virological suppression was maintained and immunological improvement continued through 
96 weeks of treatment with ATV/COBI+TVD. Using the M = F method 75.5% (37/49) had 
< 50 copies/mL at week 96 and the mean (SD) change from baseline in CD4 cell count was 
317 (186.1) cells/µL. 
Data in support of the use of DRV/co 
GS-US-216-0130 
GS-US-216-0130 is an ongoing Phase 3b, single-arm, open-label safety and efficacy study in 
HIV-1 infected ARV treatment-naive and treatment-experienced adults with no DRV RAMs. 
Subjects receive DRV/co plus 2 investigator-selected (fully active) NRTIs.  
Overall 259/295 (87.8%) treatment-naive subjects and 15/18 (83.3%) treatment-experienced 
subjects in the full analysis set (FAS) were still on study drugs up to the Week 24 analysis cut-
off. The majority of subjects received TDF-based regimens (294/295 and 17/18), usually as 
Truvada (292/295 and 11/18). The treatment-naive cohort was mostly male (90.2%) and had 
a mean age of 36 years. The treatment-experienced cohort included 13 male subjects and had 
a mean age of 45 years. The baseline mean HIV-1 RNA was 4.8 log 10 copies/mL for both 
cohorts but mean CD4 counts were 378.2 (199.94) cells/µL for the naïve and 
197.8 (214.30) cells/µL for the experienced with CD4% of 22.6% vs. 11.9%. 
Assessment report  
Page 59/86 
 
 
 
  
  
 
A lower percentage of subjects had an adherence rate of ≥ 95% up to the Week 24 visit in the 
treatment-experienced cohort (77.8% vs. 94.6%).  
In the treatment-naive cohort a higher percentage achieved virological success at Week 24 
among those with baseline viral load ≤ 100,000 copies/mL (87.9%) compared with the subset 
with > 100,000 copies/mL (77.9%). The difference in virological success between subgroups 
primarily reflected the higher numbers with ≥ 50 copies/mL at Week 24 in the 
> 100,000 copies/mL subgroup i.e. 13.1% [16/122 subjects] vs. 0.6% [1/173 subjects] among 
those with ≤ 100,000 copies/mL at baseline.

Ten (10) subjects met the criteria for resistance analysis (5 naïve). One treatment-experienced 
subject (with poor pill bottle returns indicative of poor adherence) developed a resistance 
mutation to DRV at position I84 as a mixture with wild-type (I84I/V). No phenotypic resistance 
to DRV or other PIs was associated with that mutation. No subject developed NRTI resistance 
mutations to their concomitant NRTI regimen. 
GS-US-236-0118 
GS-US-236-0118 is an ongoing Phase 3 open-label safety and efficacy study in HIV-1 infected 
subjects with mild to moderate renal impairment in which COBI is used as a booster of DRV or 
ATV in treatment-experienced subjects (Cohort 2) or is administered as part of STB (Cohort 1). 
New non-comparative interim data through Week 24 provide further support for the efficacy of 
COBI as a booster of DRV.  Twenty out of twenty one (20/21) subjects administered DRV/co+2 
NRTIs remained virologically suppressed at Week 24. The remaining subject discontinued study 
drug due to other reasons and had last available HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The applicant selected the dose of COBI (150 mg) based on GS-US-216-0110 and GS-US-216-
0115 in which the effect of COBI on PK of ATV and DRV was evaluated. 
Assessment report  
Page 60/86 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
The assessment of the effectiveness of COBI as a booster for ATV was based on the data from 
phase 2 and 3 studies. GS-US-216-0114 is the single pivotal efficacy study (Phase 3, 
Randomized, Double-Blind Study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of COBI-boosted ATV 
versus RTV-boosted ATV each administered with Truvada in HIV-1 Infected treatment-naive 
adults). GS-US-216-0114 is supported by a single Phase 2 study GS-US-216-0105 that was of 
a similar design but in much smaller numbers of subjects. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL 
at Week 48 as defined by the FDA snapshot analysis algorithm. Non-inferiority of 
ATV/COBI+TVD relative to ATV/RTV+TVD was assessed using 95% CI with a pre-defined non-
inferiority margin of 12%. 
The assessment of the effectiveness of COBI as a booster for DRV was based primarily on data 
from the Phase 1 study GS-US-216-0115. No randomised clinical trial was conducted by the 
Applicant. Data from the Phase 3 studies investigating the use of DRV/RTV 800/100 mg in HIV-
1 infected subjects (ARTEMIS and ODIN) and from uncontrolled efficacy data (GS-US-236-
0118, GS-US-216-0130) were submitted to support this indication. This information is reflected 
in the SmPC. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the primary analysis (ITT, 48 weeks), non-inferiority was demonstrated for ATV/COBI vs. 
ATV/RTV with a lower bound of the 95% CI at -7.4. In addition, 5.8% and 4.0% in respective 
groups had virological failure while 9.0% and 8.6% had no virological data in the Week 48 
analysis window. 
Non-inferiority was also demonstrated in the PP analysis set although actual success rates were 
higher (98%; 95% CI were -2.5, 2.3). 
Non-inferiority was also demonstrated in the analysis based on TLVOR with < 50 copies/mL in 
82.8% and 85.3% (95% CI -8.1, 2.8). In the KM analysis of TLOVR the percentages were 
comparable between treatment groups with Week 48 rates of 19% and 16% (p=0.44). 
Mean increases from baseline in CD4 cell counts were comparable between treatments at Week 
48 at 213 and 219 cells/μL. Mean increases in CD4% were also comparable at 9.7% and 9.8%. 
Subgroup analyses mostly revealed virological success rates (HIV < 50 copies/mL; snapshot 
analysis; ITT) that were numerically higher in the ATV/RTV group. Since there was a single 
pivotal efficacy study it is not possible to comment further on this observation at present. 
Primary PI-R mutations were observed in 18/692 (2.6%), most commonly L33F and L90M, but 
these viruses were considered fully sensitive to ATV on their screening report. NRTI resistance 
(NRTI-R) mutations were observed in 8.4% of subjects (58 of 692), most commonly V118I in 
36/692 (5.2%). There were 24 virological failures included in the Resistance Analysis 
Population.  
As a post authorisation measure, the applicant should provide the findings of the additional 
analysis of emergent resistance substitutions in the protease gene of patients treated with 
STB in Phase 3 studies (see Section 2.8 RMP).

At Week 96 a slightly greater proportion of subjects in the ATV/co group had virological failure 
(7.0% [24/344] vs. 4.6% [16/348] for ATV/r) principally because of the greater percentage of 
subjects in the ATV/co group who discontinued study drug due to other reasons whose last 
available HIV-1 RNA was ≥ 50 copies/mL.  
Of note, the efficacy of ATV/COBI (300/150 mg once daily) has only been demonstrated in 
conjunction with Truvada and only against viruses known to be fully susceptible to all three ARV 
agents. This reduces the sensitivity of the study GS-US-216-0114 to detect any possible effects 
of slightly lower plasma levels of ATV on efficacy. 
In study GS-US-216-0105, the mean SD baseline HIV-1 RNA value was 4.61 (0.614) log 10 
copies/mL, mean CD4 cell count was 357 (192.2) cells/µL and mean CD4% was 22.0 (9.01). 
Overall, 70.9% of subjects had baseline HIV-1 RNA level ≤ 100,000 copies/mL. The week 24 
and 48 HIV RNA data showed that ATV/COBI was not quite as effective as ATV/RTV. 
There are no efficacy data for DRV/COBI (800/150 mg once daily) and its use in conjunction 
with COBI is based solely on demonstrating a comparable DRV PK profile compared to DRV/r 
(800/100 mg once daily). While the DRV Cmax and AUC met the bioequivalence criteria the Ctau 
was 30% lower for DRV/co vs. DRV/r. However, based on PK/PD analyses and cross-study 
comparisons with PK data obtained in previous DRV/r efficacy studies (see Section on Clinical 
Pharmacology), it was concluded that this difference would not result in a difference in 
virological response between the two once daily regimens provided that the use of DRV/co is 
entirely restricted to the HIV-infected sub-population described in the DRV SmPC when using 
the once daily DRV/r regimen. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Non-inferiority for ATV/COBI vs. ATV/RTV regimen was demonstrated in study GS-US-216-
0114. Indeed, COBI was shown to achieve pharmaco-enhancement of ATV resulting in efficacy 
comparable with that achieved by ATV/RTV. 
Overall, the data support the comparable efficacy of DRV/co and DRV/r provided that the use of 
DRV/co is entirely restricted to the HIV-infected sub-population described in the DRV SmPC 
when using the once daily regimen. The SmPC reflects this information. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The principal sources of safety data for the COBI tablet presented in the original MAA were from 
two double-blind, active-controlled studies in HIV-1 infected, ARV treatment-naive subjects: 
•  Phase 3 GS-US-216-0114 (48 weeks of exposure)  
•  Phase 2 GS-US-216-0105 (60 weeks of exposure during a blinded treatment phase).  
During the evaluation, updated safety data from GS-US-216-0114 (Week 96 data cut) and 
GS-US-236-0118 (Week 24 data cut) as well as new data from GS-US-216-0130 (Week 24 
CSR) were provided as well as Week 96 data from the Phase 3 STB studies. Data were analysed 
using MedDRA Version 14.0.

Patient exposure 
In the COBI Phase 2 and 3 studies submitted with the initial submission, 394 subjects received 
ATV/COBI+TVD for a median duration of 48.4 weeks. The KM estimate for time to premature 
study drug discontinuation at Week 48 was 14% (95% CI: 10.7%, 18.1%) in the 
ATV/COBI+TVD group and 12% (95% CI: 8.1%, 14.9%) in the ATV/RTV+TVD group. 
Adverse events 
Comparable percentages of subjects in each group reported any AE or any Grade 2, 3 or 4 AE. 
A slightly higher percentage of subjects in the ATV/COBI group (17.8%) reported a Grade 3 or 
4 AE compared with ATV/RTV (13.3%). Percentages reporting a Grade 3 or 4 AE considered 
related by the investigator to study drug were low but slightly higher in the COBI group (6.9% 
vs. 4.5%). The SAE reporting rate was also slightly higher with COBI.   
In the pooled safety analysis set 92% in each group reported any AE. The table 17 shows 
details of those AEs most commonly reported.

Among the most frequently reported AEs (≥ 10% incidence in either treatment group) four 
(jaundice, nausea, hyperbilirubinaemia and upper respiratory tract infection) were reported by 
a numerically higher percentage of subjects in the ATV/COBI group and four (diarrhoea, 
headache, nasopharyngitis and ocular icterus) were reported for a numerically lower 
percentage in the ATV/COBI group. A similar percentage of subjects overall experienced 
bilirubin-related AEs. Differences in rates of ≥ 5% were observed for diarrhoea (ATV/COBI 
15.0% vs. ATV/RTV 21.2%) and nasopharyngitis (9.4% vs. 14.9%). 
The majority of the AEs reported were mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2) in severity. 
Similar percentages of subjects in both treatment groups reported AEs of Grade 2, 3 or 4 and 
the most frequently reported were: 
•  ATV/COBI - hyperbilirubinaemia (8.9%), jaundice (6.1%), headache and nausea (each 
3.6%)  
•  ATV/RTV - hyperbilirubinaemia (7.2%), diarrhoea (4.8%), urinary tract infection (4.0%) 
Grade 3 or 4 AEs were reported by a slightly higher percentage in the ATV/COBI group (17.8%) 
compared to ATV/RTV (13.3%). This difference was driven by the difference in Grade 3 AEs and 
reflected the rates of bilirubin-associated AEs.

c  Multiple AEs were counted only once per subject for the highest grade for each SOC and PT, 
respectively. 
Percentages reporting any AE considered related to study drug by the investigator were 
comparable between treatment groups (56.9% vs. 57.3%). In both treatment groups, the most 
frequently reported drug-related AEs were ocular icterus, nausea and jaundice. Gastrointestinal 
and hepatobiliary AEs were commonly considered related to study drug in both treatment 
groups. Rates for individual TEAEs (Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event) were mostly closely 
comparable between treatment groups. 
At Week 96 in GS-US-216-0114 the most frequently reported AEs in the ATV/co group were 
jaundice (21.2%), ocular icterus (19.5%) and nausea (17.7%) while in the ATV/r group the 
most common were diarrhoea and ocular icterus (each 20.4%), jaundice (17.0%) and nausea 
(16.4%). Several SOCs showed a slightly higher rate for total AEs for ATV/co vs. ATV/r (e.g. 
cardiac disorders 11 [3.2%] vs. 5 [1.4%], mainly reflecting differences in rates of bradycardia 
and palpitations) but the reverse pattern also occurred several times and numbers are small so 
that no definite conclusions can be drawn. 
Hepatic events  
There were no reports of acute hepatic failure, hepatic failure or liver injury in the Phase 2 and 
3 studies. No subjects up to the Week 96 cut-off met Hy’s law criteria. 
A slightly higher rate of bilirubin-related AEs occurred with ATV/co vs. ATV/r (none was 
serious). At Week 48 in GS-US-0114 40.7% ATV/co+TVD and 36.2% ATV/r+TVD subjects were 
reported as having experienced bilirubin-related AEs. In contrast 12 (3.5%) and 11 (3.2%) in 
respective groups discontinued study drug due to bilirubin-related AEs (i.e. jaundice, ocular 
icterus, blood bilirubin increased or hyperbilirubinaemia), suggesting that the small difference 
in the rates of bilirubin-related AEs was not clinically meaningful. These subjects mostly had 
liver function tests expected with the use of boosted ATV, chronic HBV or HCV, abnormal 
baseline transaminases or other causative factors. All study drug-related hepatic AEs were 
largely reversible upon discontinuation.  
COBI and RTV have similar inhibitory potencies against UGT1A1 and MRP2 and there are no 
known effects of COBI that could explain the difference between the ATV/co and ATV/r 
treatment groups. Although COBI has not been evaluated for its inhibitory potency for MRP3, it 
is unlikely to be substantially different from that of RTV. 
Rash events 
In the Phase 2 and 3 studies the percentages with any rash were comparable between 
treatment groups (17.8% vs. 19.6%). There were three SAEs of rash including two in the 
Assessment report  
Page 65/86 
 
 
  
  
 
ATV/COBI group who had rashes considered unrelated to study drug by the investigator. They 
continued on treatment without recurrence. 
ECG effects 
In the Phase 3 study there were no notable differences between treatment groups in the 
percentages of subjects with ECG abnormalities. In the Phase 2 study there were no clinically 
relevant changes from baseline in median values for ECG parameters.  
Summary of Renal events  
In the Phase 2 and 3 studies in which COBI was given as ATV/co+TVD there were 8 subjects in 
the ATV/co+TVD group, 1 subject in the ATV/rATV/co+TVD group (Phase 2) and 15 subjects 
in the ATV/r+TVD group with either a renal SAE, discontinued study drug due to a renal AE 
and/or had a pre-specified renal AE of interest. One additional ATV/co subject discontinued due 
to IgA nephropathy. A summary of these events is as follows: 
Renal SAEs 
•  Two subjects (0.6%) in the ATV/co+TVD group each had one renal SAE reported 
(Fanconi syndrome acquired and nephropathy) in GS-US-216-0114.  
•  Eight subjects (2.4%) in the ATV/r+TVD group had a renal SAE reported (4 cases of acute 
renal failure; one each for renal failure, renal tubular necrosis and Fanconi syndrome; one 
case of renal tubular acidosis type 2 reported after the Week 96 data cut. 
Discontinuation due to renal AEs 
•  Eight subjects (2.3%) in the ATV/co+TVD group discontinued study drug due to renal 
events (blood creatinine increased, creatinine renal clearance decreased, Fanconi 
syndrome acquired, GFR abnormal, GFR decreased, renal impairment, nephropathy and 
IgA nephropathy [original PT renal failure]). 
•  Eleven subjects (3.2%) in the ATV/r+TVD group discontinued study drug due to renal 
events (blood creatinine increased for 2 subjects; proteinuria and glycosuria for 1 subject; 
creatinine renal clearance decreased, Fanconi syndrome acquired, GFR abnormal, renal 
failure, acute renal failure, renal impairment and renal tubular necrosis all in 1 subject 
each; renal tubular acidosis type 2 (verbatim term) for 1 subject. 
Renal AEs of interest  
•  For the 2 subjects (0.6%) in the ATV/co+TVD group the renal AEs of interest reported 
were Fanconi syndrome acquired and renal failure.  
•  For the 7 subjects (2.0%) in the ATV/r+TVD group the renal AEs of interest reported were 
Fanconi syndrome acquired (1 subject), renal failure (2 subjects) and renal failure acute 
(4 subjects). 
Proximal renal tubulopathy (PRT) 
Overall, 13 subjects had evidence of PRT. For 6 subjects (1.7%) in the ATV/co+TVD group and 
7 subjects (2.0%) in the ATV/r+TVD group, the renal AEs and laboratory findings were 
consistent with PRT. Each of these subjects discontinued study drug due to renal AEs. Five of 
Assessment report  
Page 66/86 
 
  
  
 
the 6 in the ATV/co+TVD group and 2/7 in the ATV/r+TVD group were reported in the Week 48 
CSR. The additional four subjects reported at Week 96 were all in the ATV/r group. There were 
also 2 in the ATV/co+TVD group plus one who switched to ATV/co in the Phase 2 study and 9 in 
the ATV/r+TVD group who had renal AEs reported but did not have evidence of PRT.  
Other relevant data from GS-US-216-0114 to week 96 were as follows: 
Serum Creatinine 
The median change from baseline at 2 weeks was 0.11 mg/dL in the ATV/co+TVD group and 
0.05 mg/dL in the ATV/r+TVD group. Values generally stabilized by Week 24 with median 
changes from baseline at Week 96 of 0.12 mg/dL and 0.08 mg/dL, respectively. Similar 
percentages of subjects in each treatment group had graded treatment-emergent serum 
creatinine abnormalities (ATV/co 7.3% [25]; ATV/r 5.2% [18]). Two subjects in the ATV/co 
group had a Grade 3 serum creatinine abnormality with no Grade 4 abnormalities. In the ATV/r 
group one had a Grade 3 and 2 subjects had a Grade 4 abnormality. 
Serum Phosphate 
Hypophosphataemia of any grade was observed in 10.8% (37) in the ATV/co group and 7.8% 
(27) in the ATV/r group. One in each treatment group had Grade 3 hypophosphataemia but 
none reached Grade 4. 
Glycosuria 
Glycosuria occurred in 6.4% (22 subjects) in each group with Grade 3 reported for 8 subjects 
(2.3%) in the ATV/co+TVD group and 9 subjects (2.6%) in the ATV/r+TVD group. 
Proteinuria 
Proteinuria was observed in ATV/co+TVD 42.1% and ATV/r+TVD 40.5%. Most were Grade 1 
(ATV/co 34.2%; ATV/r 33.5%). One subject in the ATV/co group had Grade 3 proteinuria. 
Subclinical Kidney Disease 
No subject who did not discontinue study drug due to a renal AE met the criteria for subclinical 
kidney disease (i.e. confirmed creatinine increase ≥ 0.4 mg/dL and confirmed abnormalities in 
at least 2 of hypophosphataemia, urine protein [2-grade increase] and normoglycaemic 
glycosuria occurring at the same visit at least once with no alternative aetiology). 
Exploratory analyses attempted to find additional cases of PRT based on 1-grade increase in 
combination with other renal abnormalities (serum creatinine, normoglycaemic glycosuria, 
hypophosphataemia). No subjects in either group met all criteria but 4 subjects (2 ATV/co and 
2 ATV/r) had at least 2 of the 3 markers of tubular dysfunction without confirmed creatinine 
increase ≥ 0.4 mg/dL. Therefore, there were no additional cases of PRT through Week 96 that 
were not identified through AEs. 
Reversibility of PRT after discontinuing ATV/co+TVD 
•  Serum creatinine values returned to within approximately 30% of baseline after study drug 
discontinuation in 5/6 in the ATV/co+TVD group with PRT and improved in the other. Two 
subjects started a regimen containing RTV, which has an inhibitory effect on renal tubular 
secretion of creatinine. One subject had only 1 post-dose value due to being lost to follow up. 
Assessment report  
Page 67/86 
 
  
  
 
•  Hypophosphataemia returned to baseline levels after study discontinuation for all 3 subjects 
with hypophosphataemia as a manifestation of PRT. 
•  Normoglycaemic glycosuria normalized after study discontinuation for all 3 subjects with 
normoglycaemic glycosuria as a manifestation of PRT. None of these subjects had diabetes. 
•  Urine protein values returned to baseline after study drug discontinuation for all 4 subjects 
with PRT and sufficient follow up data. One subject had negative urine protein at baseline 
and +2 urine protein at the time of study drug discontinuation, which improved to +1 after 
study drug discontinuation; the subject did not have a sufficient follow up period. One 
subject was lost follow up after study drug discontinuation and did not have follow-up urine 
protein values. 
Bone Fractures 
In GS-US-216-0114 fractures occurred in 9 in the ATV/co+TVD group (2.6%) and 11 in the 
ATV/r+TVD group (3.2%). Non-traumatic fractures were reported for 2 subjects in the 
ATV/co+TVD group (hand fracture while using hedge trimmers; wrist fracture after fall from 
bicycle) and 1 in the ATV/r+TVD group (spinal compression fracture). 
GS-US-216-0130 included 311 (of 313; 99.4%) who received TDF as a background NRTI 
therapy. No subject experienced a renal AE of interest, a renal SAE or discontinued due to a 
renal event and there was no association with PRT in any subject.  
GS-US-236-0118 required subjects to have eGFR CG between 50 and 89 mL/min at baseline. 
Interim results are available when all subjects had completed 24 weeks or had discontinued.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The single death was due to an accident in the Phase 2 study GS-US-216-0105.  
One SAE of spontaneous abortion in a subject with a prior similar event and two terminations 
were reported in Phase 1 studies with COBI in healthy volunteers and one SAE of diabetic foot 
ulcer was reported in a subject with severe renal impairment.  
In the initial submission, SAEs in Phase 2 and 3 studies were reported for 38 subjects in the 
ATV/COBI group (9.6%) compared with 25 in the ATV/RTV group (6.6%). There was no 
apparent pattern in the types of SAEs by treatment and the only SAE reported in > 1% of 
subjects in either group was acute renal failure (all 4 were in the ATV/RTV group). The organ 
system most commonly associated with SAEs was Infections and Infestations (14 subjects per 
group).  
SAEs considered related to treatment occurred in 5 (1.3%) and 6 (1.6%) subjects in respective 
groups. In the ATV/COBI group these were rhabdomyolysis, spontaneous abortion, depression, 
Fanconi Syndrome (acquired) and nephropathy. In the ATV/RTV group these were pyrexia, GGT 
increased, Fanconi Syndrome (acquired), renal failure, renal failure (acute), priapism and rash. 
In the Phase 2 study GS-US-216-0105, the additional SAEs that occurred after the randomised 
phase included pericarditis, accidental death, alcoholic hepatitis + jaundice, suicide attempt and 
renal colic in the group initially randomised to ATV/COBI and a case of meningitis in the group 
initially randomised to ATV/RTV.  
Assessment report  
Page 68/86 
 
  
  
 
In GS-US-216-0114 up to Week 96, SAEs were reported for a slightly greater percentage in the 
ATV/co group (14.8% [51 subjects] vs. 10.1% [35 subjects]). The differences reflected 
imbalances in several SOCs but the most marked occurred for gastro-intestinal disorders (8 vs. 
1). Nevertheless, the numbers for individual types of events were low and it is not possible to 
comment further. One SAE of acute renal failure occurred in ≥ 1% of subjects in either 
treatment group but all four cases [1.1%] were in the ATV/r group.  
In contrast, SAEs considered by the investigator to be related to study drug were reported for 
1.7% [6] in the ATV/co group and 2.3% [8] in the ATV/r group while percentages with any AE 
considered related to study drug by the investigator were 60.8% and 63.8%, respectively. 
Grade 3 or 4 drug-related AEs occurred in 7.8% [27] and 6.6% [23].  
Pregnancies 
Four pregnancies were reported in Phase 1 studies with COBI and one in 
study GS-US-201-0101 but one occurred in a subject who did not receive COBI. One resulted in 
a healthy term infant, one in spontaneous abortion (see SAE above), one in termination and 
one in a live birth.  
There were no pregnancies in the Phase 2 study but 6 occurred in the Phase 3 study (3 per 
treatment group) and study drug was discontinued in 4 subjects. In the ATV/COBI group one 
had a spontaneous abortion on Day 336, which was considered by the investigator to be related 
to study drug. No action was taken with study drug. One had an induced abortion and remained 
on study drug. For the other 4 subjects the pregnancies were either ongoing or the outcomes 
were unknown at the data cut-off date. 
Laboratory findings 
In the Phase 2 and 3 studies almost all subjects had at least one laboratory abnormality 
reported (98.5% and 98.9%) and most had at least one Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality 
(75.0% and 63.5%). The most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 abnormalities in both 
treatment groups were total bilirubin (which accounted for much of the overall treatment group 
difference), lipase and creatinine kinase. The lipase test was only performed for subjects with 
serum amylase > 1.5 x ULN and the denominator is the number tested. 
Renal effects 
Renal laboratory parameters were extensively evaluated due to the recognised effect of COBI 
on serum creatinine and its inhibition of OCT2 and MATE1 (active secretion accounts for 10% to 
40% of creatinine clearance in patients with normal renal function).  
In the Phase 2 and 3 studies increases in median values for serum creatinine in the ATV/COBI 
group were noted as early as Week 2 (0.11 mg/dL) but stabilised through Week 48 
(0.13 mg/dL). While the same pattern occurred in the ATV/RTV group the changes from 
baseline were smaller (median change at Week 2 was 0.05 mg/dL and at Week 48 it was 
0.09 mg/dL). 
A higher percentage of subjects in the ATV/COBI group had Grade 1 abnormalities in serum 
creatinine (6.4% vs. 3.7%). There was one Grade 2 and two Grade 3 abnormalities compared

to none in the ATV/RTV group but there was one subject in the ATV/RTV group with a Grade 4 
increase on Days 112 and 114 associated with acute renal failure ascribed to Salmonella 
enteritis.  
The data from the Phase 2 and 3 studies on eGFR by Cockcroft-Gault showed decreases in 
median eGFRCG post baseline in both groups (baseline median 111.2 mL/min [ATV/COBI+TVD] 
and 114.5 mL/min [ATV/RTV+TVD]; median change from baseline at Week 48 –12.9 mL/min 
[ATV/COBI+TVD] and –9.3 mL/min [ATV/RTV+TVD]. The decreases in eGFRCG as early as 
Week 2 of treatment with only minimal changes after Week 4 were consistent with inhibition of 
active tubular secretion of creatinine. Median values remained within the normal range. 
•  The results for eGFR calculated using the modified diet in renal disease equation (eGFRMDRD) 
were consistent with those observed for eGFRCG. Decreases in median eGFRMDRD gave 
median change from baseline at Week 48 of -14.5 mL/min/1.73 m2 [ATV/COBI+TVD] and –
10.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 [ATV/RTV+TVD]. 
•  Results for cysGFR showed increases to Week 48 in both treatment groups of 
5.3 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 6.6 mL/min/1.73 m2. 
•  No subjects had eGFRCG below 50 mL/min during the study, including the subjects that 
switched to open label ATV/COBI+TVD. One subject that switched had decreased GFR levels 
reported that led to study drug discontinuation. 
Serum Phosphorus 
Median values for serum phosphorus were within normal ranges throughout the randomized 
parts of the Phase 2 and 3 studies. Hypophosphataemia was observed in 7.4% in the 
ATV/COBI+TVD and 5.6% in the ATV/RTV+TVD group but there were no Grade 3 or 4 events. 
Glycosuria 
Glycosuria was observed for comparable percentages in the two treatment groups (4.9% and 
4.5%). Glycosuria tended to occur transiently and in isolation. Grade 3 urine glucose 
abnormalities were reported for 2.6% and 1.3% and these subjects typically also had notable 
urine glucose at screening or baseline. 
Proteinuria 
Proteinuria was observed for 33.0% and 32.3% per group. Most events were Grade 1 in 
severity (27.4% and 27.5%). One subject in the ATV/COBI+TVD group had Grade 3 proteinuria 
on study and had trace proteinuria and Grade 2 haematuria at baseline that fluctuated through 
Week 48. In the group that switched to COBI, Grade 1 proteinuria was reported for 30.9% and 
Grade 2 for 4.4%. 
Urine Fractional Excretion of Phosphate 
Urine phosphate was assessed in the Phase 3 study in which there were small increases in 
median urine fractional excretion of phosphate in the ATV/COBI+TVD group (median change 
from baseline was 2.0% at Week 2 and was stable within a range of 1.1% – 2.1% through 
Week 48). In the ATV/RTV+TVD group the median change from baseline was 1.8% at Week 2 
and was stable within a range of 1.4% – 1.7% through Week 48.

Liver-Related Laboratory Tests 
In the initial submission the elevated ALT rates were 18.4% in the ATV/COBI and 12.5% in the 
ATV/RTV groups while elevated AST rates were 21.2% and 14.1%. Abnormalities in GGT and 
alkaline phosphatase as well as elevated total bilirubin occurred in comparable percentages. 
There were 14 subjects in each treatment group with 3xULN AST or ALT concurrent with 2xULN 
total bilirubin. However, direct bilirubin > 2xULN occurred infrequently (ATV/COBI 0.5%; 
ATV/RTV 1.1%). Subjects with significant LFT test abnormalities generally had abnormal 
baseline AST or ALT, underlying chronic HBV or HCV co-infection or a history of alcoholism or 
alcohol abuse. 
During the review of the present application, another two subjects in each of the ATV/co and 
ATV/r groups in GS-US-216-0114 had elevations in AST or ALT > 3 times the ULN along with 
elevations of total bilirubin of > 2 times the ULN. In all four cases the hyperbilirubinaemia was 
due to an elevation in indirect bilirubin, which is consistent with the effect of ATV. The AST and 
ALT values normalised in all cases despite continuation of study drug. One ATV/co subject had 
AST or ALT > 3 times the ULN that appeared to have occurred in association with the use of 
fenofibrate. Therefore, it remains the case that no subject has experienced laboratory 
abnormalities that would meet the Hy’s law criteria for drug-induced liver injury. 
In the safety update analysis dataset 66 subjects had AST or ALT > 3 times ULN with or 
without concurrent increase in total bilirubin > 2 times ULN at least once while on study 
treatment. These 66 subjects comprised 64 from the randomised phase of GS-US-216-0114 
and GS-US-216-0105 [36 ATV/co and 28 ATV/r] and 2 from the ATV/co open-label phase of 
GS-US-216-0105.  
The presence of HBV surface antigen or HCV antibody as well as abnormal ALT/AST values at 
baseline all occurred more commonly in these subjects than in the overall study population. 
None of the 66 subjects was suspected to have developed severe drug-induced liver injury and 
all fell into one of the following categories: 
•  Pre-existing viral hepatitis B or C at baseline, 
•  Acquisition of viral hepatitis B or C post-baseline, 
•  Pre-existing medical condition or concurrent AE as a potential cause of liver laboratory 
abnormalities, such as alcohol use or syphilitic hepatitis, 
•  Concomitant use of another potentially hepatotoxic drug, such as isoniazid or fenofibrate, 
•  Normalisation or no progressive worsening of ALT/AST while continuing study drug. 
Fasting Glucose and Lipid Parameters 
Numerically smaller increases in fasting total cholesterol and triglycerides were observed at 
Week 48 in the ATV/COBI group. Mean increases from baseline through Week 48 in LDL 
cholesterol and HDL cholesterol were comparable between treatments. There were no clinically 
relevant changes from baseline through Week 48 in mean values for fasting glucose in either 
group. Abnormalities in fasting and non-fasting glucose and lipid parameters were generally 
Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity. There was no pattern in the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 
abnormalities. 
Assessment report  
Page 71/86 
 
  
  
 
Safety in special populations 
There were no notable effects of gender, age or race on AE rates or patterns although the low 
proportion of female subjects limits the conclusions. 
In the Phase 2 and 3 studies numbers co-infected with HBV were 3.2% (25 subjects) and co-
infection with HCV occurred in 4.8% (37 subjects). The hepatic AE profile in these subjects was 
consistent with underlying hepatitis infection in that elevations in AST and ALT occurred more 
frequently than in the general HIV-1 infected population.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Discontinuations due to TEAEs in Phase 1 studies involving COBI did not show treatment-
related trends. In the Phase 2 and 3 studies the initial submission reported that comparable 
percentages in the ATV/COBI (6.9%) and ATV/RTV groups (7.2%) discontinued study 
prematurely due to an AE. Events associated with hyperbilirubinaemia such as jaundice (2.3%, 
9 subjects; 1.9%, 7 subjects) and ocular icterus (2.0%, 8 subjects; 1.3%, 5 subjects) were the 
only AEs that led to discontinuation in > 1% in either treatment group.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The clinical trial population has been adequately quantified and stratified by relevant 
categories, including special populations, to allow assessment of the limitations of the human 
safety database and implications for the safety of the target population. Additional data from 
patients exposed to COBI as a component of the QUAD STR showed a similar distribution of 
patients. 
In terms of under-represented populations, the study population was male-dominated (about 
87% male to 13% female) and the study patients of Asian ethnicity were underrepresented 
(about 7% of the clinical trial population, compared with 58% white and 27% black). 
Adverse events and SAEs 
Among the most frequently reported AEs (≥ 10% incidence in either treatment group) four 
(jaundice, nausea, hyperbilirubinaemia and upper respiratory tract infection) were reported by 
a numerically higher percentage of subjects in the ATV/COBI group.  
Grade 3 or 4 AEs were reported by a slightly higher percentage in the ATV/COBI group (17.8%) 
compared to ATV/RTV (13.3%). This difference was driven by the difference in Grade 3 AEs and 
reflected the rates of bilirubin-associated AEs. 
There was no apparent pattern in the types of SAEs by treatment and the only SAE reported in 
> 1% of subjects in either group was acute renal failure.

Renal effect 
As a result of known safety profile for the QUAD STR, the CHMP placed a special emphasis on 
the review of the effect of COBI on the renal function. Indeed, there is a known risk of adverse 
renal effects associated with TDF.  
Background QUAD STR application 
It is important to summarise the assessment on this risk perfomed in the context of the QUAD 
STR application. There is a known risk of adverse renal effects associated with TDF. Though 
consistent with the known safety profile for TFV, the renal adverse reactions observed during 
the QUAD STR application was of concern for the CHMP. Hence, the CHMP requested the study 
GS-US-236-0130 to examine the effect of 5 treatments (COBI, TDF, COBI+TDF, Stribild and 
placebo) when given once daily for 30 days followed for a further 30 days. Day 60 data from 
this study showed that the QUAD STB had the greatest effect on aGFR and the follow-up data 
indicate that the 90% CI around the comparison vs. placebo did not span 100% after 30 days 
off treatment. The comparisons within treatments for change in renal plasma flow from baseline 
point to the most marked effect in the COBI + TDF and the QUAD STB groups. The reason for 
the apparent greater effect of QUAD STB was not clear. Given the variability observed in aGFR 
and renal plasma flow it is not impossible that the observations could have arisen by chance in 
this parallel group study. Also, there was no known reason why the QUAD STB might have a 
greater effect on aGFR than TDF + COBI.  
Currently there is no known mechanism by which COBI may have a causative role in PRT. Non-
clinical data suggest that FTC, COBI and EVG do not affect the cytotoxicity of TFV in renal 
proximal tubule cells and that COBI has no effect on TFV accumulation in isolated renal cortical 
tissue.  In vitro experiments were completed in cultured primary human renal proximal tubule 
cells (RPTECs) to assess the cytotoxicity of TFV alone and in the presence of QUAD STB 
components. The results generated with cells from two independent donors indicated low 
cytotoxicity of TFV (CC50 > 4,000 μM) that was not affected by COBI, EVG, or FTC at 
pharmacologically relevant concentrations. Since it is known that RPTECs may down-regulate 
some of the active renal transport functions due to de-differentiation process triggered by their 
in vitro culturing, the applicant has also initiated studies in HEK-293 cells co-transfected with 
OAT1 and MRP4, the two key transporters responsible for the active tubular secretion of TFV. 
Preliminary experiments confirmed the functionality of both transporters following co-
transfection and the applicant will proceed to optimize cytotoxicity measurement in the HEK-
293 cell culture model. The studies will continue with the assessment of the effect of individual 
QUAD STB components on the cytotoxicity of TFV. 
From the above it can be concluded that there are currently inadequate data to determine 
whether co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and cobicistat is associated with a 
greater risk of renal adverse reactions compared with regimens that include tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate without cobicistat. The CHMP requested a SAG consultation to have the views of 
additional experts on this issue. The minutes are included below: 
“Based on the data available at present, there was a consensus from the HIV/AV SAG that 
there was no firm evidence pointing to an increased risk of PRT with Stribild or with COBI + 
TDF versus other TDF-containing products. More extensive and longer term exposure to Striblid 
Assessment report  
Page 73/86 
 
  
  
 
and or COBI associated to TDF should be requested in the ‘real life situation’ to better assess 
characteristics and risk factors for renal toxicity. 
Given the uncertainties related to the results of study 0130 (in healthy subjects) the experts 
recommended by consensus that the applicant should be requested to conduct a comparative 
study in HIV-infected subjects to further evaluate the possible relevance of the data generated 
by study 130 and suggested a study design for CHMP’s consideration. 
In addition, some experts expressed interest in understanding the mechanism of the potential 
renal effect of Stribild and TDF + COBI on aGFR and encouraged the applicant to investigate it. 
Given uncertainties on reversibility of renal effects, the experts recommended the applicant 
gather additional information on this point. 
Overall the SAG considers the risks can be managed via appropriate advice in the SmPC and 
recommended the inclusion of further comments on the SmPC.” 
Following consideration of the SAG recommendations, the CHMP concluded that the renal 
effects of the QUAD STB can be addressed via adequate advice in the SmPC that will allow early 
identification of patients at risk of developing STB-related renal toxicity.  
COBI application 
In the Phase 2 and 3 studies in which COBI was given as ATV/co+TVD there were 8 subjects in 
the ATV/co+TVD group, 1 subject in the ATV/rATV/co+TVD group (Phase 2) and 15 subjects 
in the ATV/r+TVD group with either a renal SAE, discontinued study drug due to a renal AE 
and/or had a pre-specified renal AE of interest. One additional ATV/co subject discontinued due 
to IgA nephropathy.  
Renal laboratory parameters were extensively evaluated as COBI has been shown to decrease 
estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine. An increase 
from baseline in serum creatinine solely due to COBI’s inhibitory effect generally does not 
exceed 0.4 mg/dL. 
In study GS-US 216 0114, decreases in estimated creatinine clearance occurred early in 
treatment with COBI, after which they stabilised.  The mean (± SD) change in estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by Cockcroft-Gault method after 48 weeks of treatment was 
13.4 ± 15.2 ml/min in the COBI-boosted atazanavir plus Truvada and 8.7 ± 14.5 ml/min in the 
RTV-boosted ATV plus emtricitabine and Truvada. 
There remains some degree of uncertainty regarding the potential combined effects of TFV and 
COBI on renal function. Therefore, although there is no remaining major objection regarding 
use of COBI as a pharmaco-enhancer of ATV or DRV and there are no grounds to preclude its 
use in conjunction with TDF, it cannot be ruled out that further data could reveal an additive 
risk of renal issues if the PI/co is administered as part of a regimen that also includes TDF. A 
warning has been added in the SmPC to reflect this information. 
In addition, the applicant has planned to conduct a study to evaluate the effect of the QUAD 
STR, a TDF regimen without COBI and a regimen without COBI or TDF in HIV-1 infected ARV 
treatment naïve patients. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the effect on TDF, on the 
renal fucntion and on to markers of renal tubular function with and without COBI. In addition, 
Assessment report  
Page 74/86 
 
  
  
 
the applicant has initiated in vitro studies of the individual components of the QUAD STR on the 
cytotoxicity of TFV in HEK-293 cells co-transferred with OAT1 and MRP4. The objectives of this 
study are to evaluate the effect of the individual components of the QUAD STR on the 
cytotoxicity of TFV and will provide useful information for COBI MA. The results of these studies 
will be submitted as post authorisation measures (see RMP Section 2.8). 
The use of COBI in patients with renal impairment has been identified as an important item of 
missing information. A clinical study of COBI boosted darunavir and atazanavir in HIV-1 
infected adults with mild to moderate renal impairment is currently in progress (GS-US-236-
0118). However, in the light of data showing no meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics 
of COBI in non-HIV infected subjects with severe renal impairment and healthy subjects (GS US 
216 0124), no restrictions on use in patients with renal impairment are proposed except in 
cases where dosage adjustment based on creatinine clearance is required for co-administered 
medicinal products.  
Hepatic effect 
In study GS-US-216-0114, hyperbilirubinaemia (> 1 x ULN) was common: 97.7% in the COBI-
boosted ATV plus Truvada group, and 97.4% in the RTV-boosted ATV plus Truvada group. 
However, a higher percentage of subjects in the COBI-boosted group had increases in total 
bilirubin > 2 x ULN than those in the RTV-boosted group (85.7% vs 77.7%). The rates of study 
drug discontinuation due to bilirubin-related adverse events were low and similar in both 
groups (4.9% in the COBI-boosted group and 3.4% in the RTV-boosted group). An increase of 
> 3 x ULN in ALT or AST was recorded in 12.0% of subjects in the COBI-boosted group and 
8.7% in the RTV-boosted group. 
There were no reports of acute hepatic failure, hepatic failure or liver injury in the Phase 2 and 
3 studies. No subjects up to the Week 96 cut-off met Hy’s law criteria. A slightly higher rate of 
bilirubin-related AEs occurred with ATV/co vs. ATV/r (none was serious).  
Hepatobiliary disorders are not considered as an important potential risk for COBI. The safety 
specification in the RMP includes information about hyperbilirubinaemia and increased AST / 
ALT laboratory abnormalities from clinical studies. The ongoing studies for COBI (GS-US-216-
0114 and GS-US-216-0130) will provide additional long-term safety information for ATV/co and 
DRV/co, including information of hyperbilirubinaemia and increased AST and ALT. The results of 
these studies will be submitted as post authorisation measures (see RMP Section 2.8). 
Safety in patients with moderate hepatic impairment has been studied and no dose adjustment 
is required. Since COBI is primarily metabolized in and eliminated by the liver and that COBI 
has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), the use 
of COBI in this population is contraindicated.  
There was a higher incidence of other hepatic AEs and in hepatic grade 3 and 4 laboratory 
abnormalities in subjects co-infected with HBV or HCV compared with subjects without co-
infection. Based on the data submitted with the present application, the overall safety profile in 
the HIV-1 infected subjects co-infected with HBV and/or HCV at baseline was consistent with 
underlying hepatitis co-infection and the safety profile of ATV, and was generally similar to that 
in the wider safety population without co-infection. 
Assessment report  
Page 75/86 
 
  
  
 
Missing information 
The main patient sub-populations not studied in clinical trials are adults (long-term safety), 
children, the elderly, women who are pregnant or lactating, those with renal impairment and 
those with severe hepatic impairment. Studies to provide missing data on long-term use in 
adults (GS-US-216-0114 and GS-US-216-0130) and safety in patients with renal impairment 
(GS-US-236-0118) are currently underway. Studies on use in children are planned (GS-US-
236-0128 and GS-US-183-0154). Of note, COBI is not recommended for use in children. The 
results of these studies will be submitted as post authorisation measures (see RMP Section 
2.8). 
Although safety in elderly patients is considered as missing information for COBI, no specific 
recommendations are made with regard to use in this group and no studies are currently 
envisaged. 
In the absence of adequate well-controlled studies of COBI in pregnant women, and indeed 
with pregnancy as an exclusion criterion in all clinical studies, the applicant recommends use of 
COBI only if the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with COBI boosted ATV or 
DRV. Monitoring of exposure in pregnancy will be carried out through the Antiretroviral 
Pregnancy Registry (APR). The data from this registry will be submitted as post authorisation 
measures (see RMP Section 2.8). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included 
in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The use of ATV/COBI in conjunction with Truvada over at least 48 weeks has not raised any 
major concerns regarding safety. The Week 96 data from the COBI Phase 2 and 3 studies 
indicate no excess of renal AEs when COBI was co-administered with TDF (i.e. in the 
ATV/co+TVD group vs. the ATV/r+TVD group). 
However, there are currently inadequate data to determine whether co-administration of TFV 
and COBI is associated with a greater risk of renal adverse reactions compared with regimens 
that include TFV without cobicistat. A warning has been added in the SmPC. 
The applicant committed to perform a study to evaluate the effect on TDF, on the renal function 
and on to markers of renal tubular function with and without COBI. In addition, the applicant 
has initiated in vitro studies to evaluate the effect of the individual components of the QUAD 
STR on the cytotoxicity of TFV. The results of these studies will be submitted as post 
authorisation measures (see RMP Section 2.8). 
The available data also point to a slight excess of hyperbilirubinaemia of higher grades and of 
raised transaminases with ATV/co vs. ATV/r. Due to the modest size of the current safety 
database, the safety specification in the RMP includes information about hyperbilirubinaemia 
and increased AST / ALT laboratory abnormalities from clinical studies. The ongoing studies for 
COBI (GS-US-216-0114 and GS-US-216-0130) will provide additional long-term safety 
information for ATV/co and DRV/co, including information of hyperbilirubinaemia and increased 
AST and ALT. The results of these studies will be submitted as post authorisation measures 
(see RMP Section 2.8).

The SmPC (Section 4.6) 
contains information that it is 
unknown whether 
COBI/metabolites are excreted 
in human milk, that a risk to

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Cobicistat is a selective, mechanism-based inhibitor of cytochromes P450 of the CYP3A 
subfamily.  Inhibition of CYP3A-mediated metabolism by cobicistat enhances the systemic 
exposure of CYP3A substrates (such as atazanavir or darunavir) that have limited oral 
bioavailability and a short half-life due to CYP3A-dependent metabolism. 
Cobicistat has no detectable antiviral activity against HIV 1, HBV or HCV and does not 
antagonise the antiviral effect of HIV inhibitors. On this basis its use would not contribute to the 
selection of virus bearing RAMs. 
The assessment of the efficacy of COBI as a booster for ATV was mainly based on the data 
from phase 3 studies GS-US-216-0114. Non-inferiority for ATV/COBI vs. ATV/RTV regimen was 
demonstrated in this phase 3, randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of COBI-boosted ATV versus RTV-boosted ATV each administered with Truvada in HIV-
1 Infected treatment-naive adults. Indeed, COBI was shown to achieve pharmaco-enhancement 
of ATV resulting in efficacy comparable with that achieved by ATV/RTV. 
For DRV/COBI (800/150 mg once daily) there are no efficacy data and its use in conjunction 
with COBI is based solely on demonstrating a comparable DRV PK profile compared to DRV/r 
(800/100 mg once daily). Overall, the data support the comparable efficacy of DRV/co and 
DRV/r provided that the use of DRV/co is entirely restricted to the HIV-infected sub-population 
described in the DRV SmPC when using the once daily regimen. 
Drug-drug interaction studies (DDIs) were conducted and their conclusions are adequately 
reflected in the SmPC. In the setting of boosting ATV or DRV, COBI 150 mg has the possibility 
of resulting in a slightly smaller range of potential DDIs vs. RTV 100 mg.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
The efficacy of ATV/COBI (300/150 mg once daily) has only been demonstrated in conjunction 
with Truvada and only against viruses known to be fully susceptible to all three ARV agents. 
This reduces the sensitivity of the Phase 3 study to detect any possible effects of slightly lower 
plasma levels of ATV on efficacy. Nevertheless, the plasma exposures to ATV when given with 
Assessment report  
Page 83/86 
 
  
  
 
COBI (300/150 mg) met bioequivalence criteria when compared to ATV/RTV (300/100 mg) and 
comfortably exceed the recommended ATV C trough. 
The assessment of the effectiveness of COBI as a booster for DRV was based primarily on data 
from the Phase 1 study GS-US-216-0115. No randomised clinical trial was conducted by the 
Applicant. This is reflected in the SmPC. Data from the Phase 3 studies investigating the use of 
DRV/RTV 800/100 mg in HIV-1 infected subjects (ARTEMIS and ODIN) and from uncontrolled 
efficacy data (GS-US-236-0118, GS-US-216-0130) were submitted to support this indication. 
While the DRV C max and AUC met the bioequivalence criteria the Ctau was 30% lower for 
DRV/co vs. DRV/r. PK/PD considerations and cross-study comparisons with PK data obtained in 
previous DRV/r efficacy studies provide some reassurance that the difference in Ctau is not 
likely to be associated with lower efficacy for DRV/co vs. DRV/r. However, the use of DRV/co is 
entirely restricted to the HIV-infected sub-population described in the DRV SmPC when using 
the once daily DRV/r regimen. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The use of ATV/COBI in conjunction with Truvada over at least 48 weeks has not raised any 
major concerns regarding safety. The Week 96 data from the COBI Phase 2 and 3 studies 
indicate no excess of renal AEs when COBI was co-administered with TDF (i.e. in the 
ATV/co+TVD group vs. the ATV/r+TVD group). Nevertheless, there are currently inadequate 
data to determine whether co-administration of TFV and COBI is associated with a greater risk 
of renal adverse reactions compared with regimens that include TFV without cobicistat. 
COBI co-administered with ATV or DRV should not be used in combination with another 
antiretroviral agent that requires pharmacoenhancement by means of co-administration with an 
inhibitor of CYP3A4 to reach the desired therapeutic plasma concentrations (i.e., another 
protease inhibitor or elvitegravir). Indeed dosing recommendations for such combinations have 
not been established and co-administration may result in decreased plasma concentrations of 
ATV, DRV and/or the other ARV agents that require pharmacoenhancement leading to loss of 
antiviral activity and development of resistance. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There remains some degree of uncertainty regarding the potential combined effects of TFV and 
COBI on renal function. Therefore, although there is no remaining major objection regarding 
use of COBI as a pharmaco-enhancer of ATV or DRV and there are no grounds to preclude its 
use in conjunction with TDF, it cannot be ruled out that further data could reveal an additive 
risk of renal issues if the ATV/co or DRV/co is administered as part of a regimen that also 
includes TDF. The applicant has committed to perform a number of studies to obtain assurance 
of the acceptability of this risk (see Section 2.8 RMP). In addition, a warning has been added in 
the SmPC. 
The available data also point to a slight excess of hyperbilirubinaemia of higher grades and of 
raised transaminases with ATV/co vs. ATV/r. Due to the modest size of the current safety 
database, the safety specification in the RMP includes information about hyperbilirubinaemia 
Assessment report  
Page 84/86 
 
  
  
 
and increased AST / ALT laboratory abnormalities from clinical studies. The applicant will 
provide additional long-term safety information for ATV/co and DRV/co, including information of 
hyperbilirubinaemia and increased AST and ALT, to gain further information on this risk (see 
Section 2.8 RMP). 
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
COBI  has  potential  to  be  an  useful  alternative  to  RTV  as  a  pharmaco-enhancer  of  specific 
antiretroviral  agents  that  are  substrates  of  CYP3A4.  Indeed,  COBI  has  been  shown  to  be 
effective as a pharmacokinetic enhancer of atazanavir 300 mg once daily or darunavir 800 mg 
once  daily  as  part  of  antiretroviral  combination  therapy  in  human  immunodeficiency  virus  1 
(HIV-1) infected adults. 
There are no potential safety concerns that would preclude its use with ATV or DRV. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The benefit-risk balance is currently considered to be favourable for use of COBI as a 
pharmacokinetic enhancer of atazanavir 300 mg once daily or darunavir 800 mg once daily as 
part of antiretroviral combination therapy in human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infected 
adults. 
Conclusions 
The overall benefit risk balance of cobicistat is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Tybost as a pharmacokinetic enhancer of once daily 
300 mg atazanavir or once daily 800 mg darunavir as part of antiretroviral combination 
therapy in human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infected adults is favourable and 
therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following

2.  Scientific discussion
2.1.  Introduction
Finerenone (company research code: BAY 94-8862) is a non-steroidal and selective mineralocorticoid 
receptor antagonist. The steroidal hormones, aldosterone and cortisol, are natural ligands of the MR. 
Overactivation of the MR contributes to organ damage found in CKD, HF and hypertension, through 
mediation of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects, as well as via sodium retention and endothelial 
dysfunction.
Finerenone was approved in the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway on February 16, 
2022.
In the EU, finerenone is approved for the treatment of chronic kidney disease (stage 3 and 4 with 
albuminuria) associated with type 2 diabetes in adults.
With the present variation the applicant proposes to include information from the FIGARO-DKD study in 
the SmPC.

The applicant further proposes to extend the indication to prevention of cardiovascular events and to 
enable treatment of patients with less severe renal function. In addition, the applicant proposes to include 
a reference to section 5.1. The submission consists of the following study:
•
FIGARO-DKD (Study 17530): “A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 
multicenter, event driven Phase III study to investigate the efficacy and safety of finerenone on the 
reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and the 
clinical diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease in addition to standard of care”
2.1.1.  Problem statement
Disease or condition
The proposed indication was:
Kerendia is indicated for the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and for the prevention of 
cardiovascular (CV) events in adults with CKD (stage 3 and 4 with albuminuria) associated with type 
2 diabetes in adults.
For study results with respect to renal and CV events in the population studied, see section 
5.1.
During the procedure the Applicant’s updated the proposed indication:
Kerendia is indicated for the treatment of chronic kidney disease (stage 3 and 4 with albuminuria) 
associated with type 2 diabetes in adults.
For study results with respect to renal and cardiovascular events, see section 5.1.
Epidemiology
CKD and T2D are each independently major global health concerns. In 2017, approximately 451 million 
patients worldwide were diagnosed with T2D, and this number is expected to grow to 693 million by 
20451. An estimated 20 to 40% of T2D patients develop CKD2, which is characterized by progressive 
damage and irreversible loss of function in the kidney eventually leading to kidney failure. T2D is the 
leading cause of kidney failure in developed countries3. Worldwide rates of ESRD are projected to rise in 
parallel with the substantial increase in T2D prevalence4. CKD is also associated with increased risks of CV 
mortality and morbidity, as well as impaired quality of life5.

Biologic features
The pathophysiology underlying CKD in T2D is complex and there are multiple factors involved in the 
progression of CKD and its associated morbidity6. Contemporary models of CKD in T2D posit 
hemodynamic, metabolic, inflammatory and fibrotic factors as interrelated pathophysiological drivers of 
CKD progression7.
Clinical presentation
Diagnosis, risk stratification and monitoring of CKD is based on assessments of kidney damage using 
urinary albumin excretion, and kidney function using estimations of the GFR8. Increasing albuminuria and 
decreasing eGFR are robust independent and additive predictors of increasing risk of CV events, mortality 
and accelerated progression of kidney disease. Widespread screening and utilization of these simple 
laboratory measures, in accordance with clinical guideline recommendations, has facilitated earlier 
recognition of CKD and has formed the basis for clinical staging for risk stratification. Nevertheless, CKD 
in T2D remains underdiagnosed and the true scale of disease burden is likely underestimated.
Individuals with T2D have an increased risk of premature CV disease, and in those who develop CKD, this 
risk is further exacerbated9,10. There is a 3-fold to 6-fold increase in the risk of CV mortality and CV 
events, respectively, in T2D patients with CKD compared to those with T2D alone11.
Although often insidious and asymptomatic, manifesting with vague non-specific symptoms at early 
stages, more advanced CKD is associated with deteriorating physical function and quality of life12,13,14. 
The onset of ESRD is associated with high individual and socioeconomic burden and necessitates renal 
replacement therapy with chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation to manage kidney failure. Chronic 
dialysis is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality15,16, and although kidney transplantation 
patients have improved prognosis there is often a prolonged time until transplantation.
Management
Alongside dietary and lifestyle interventions, current proven pharmacological strategies for CKD 
prevention and treatment in T2D patients include optimization of glycaemic control, blood pressure and

blood lipid levels. RAS-inhibition using an ACEI or ARB constitute the current standard of care according 
to KDIGO 2020, ADA 2019 and joint ESC/EASD 2019 guidelines17,18,19,20,21. 
In placebo-controlled studies in patients with early CKD (i.e. high albuminuria at baseline), ACEis were 
found to significantly reduce the risk of all-cause and CV mortality, and of CV morbidity22; however, they 
were not prospectively investigated in more advanced stages of CKD.
In T2D patients with CKD and very high albuminuria (UACR ≥300 mg/g), losartan reduced the incidence 
of ESRD and a doubling of serum creatinine compared to placebo, but had no effect on CV mortality and 
CV morbidity23. Irbesartan was also shown to be effective in delaying the progression of kidney disease, 
but no significant differences in the rates of CV morbidity or mortality were observed compared to 
placebo24.
Recent clinical studies with SGLT2 inhibitors showed a benefit on cardiorenal outcomes in patients with or 
without T2D and CKD, with UACR >300 mg/g or >200 mg/g in the CREDENCE25 and DAPA-CKD trials26. 
According to recent updates in KDIGO 202027, ADA and joint ESC/EASD guidelines from 201928,29, the use 
of SGLT2 inhibitors is recommended for patients with T2D and CKD.
Despite treatment with ACEis or ARBs and the concomitant use of SGLT-2 inhibitors, there remains a high 
residual risk of cardiorenal outcome events, with more than twice the normal observed age-related 
decline in kidney function30.There remains a need for further effective therapies to address the complex 
multifactorial underlying disease mechanisms including inflammation and fibrosis in CKD in a growing 
global T2D population..

ligands of the MR. Overactivation of the MR contributes to organ damage found in CKD, HF and 
hypertension, through mediation of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects, as well as via sodium 
retention and endothelial dysfunction.
Finerenone is supplied as immediate-release tablets with non-functional film coating for oral once daily 
administration in the dose strengths 10 and 20 mg.
In the EU, finerenone is approved for the treatment of chronic kidney disease (stage 3 and 4 with 
albuminuria) associated with type 2 diabetes in adults.  
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice
This application of variation is based on efficacy and safety data from the FIGARO-DKD study. Prospective 
regulatory guidance concerning the clinical development program was obtained from the EMA 
(EMEA/H/SA/3096/1/2015/III).
Clinically, in order to claim that finerenone results in both (1) a reduction of CV mortality and morbidity 
and (2) a reduction in the rate of progression of kidney disease, a significant reduction in both the CV and 
renal events has to be demonstrated in the Phase 3 program. However, because the time to renal events 
is expected to be significantly longer than the time to CV events in the DKD population, the probability of 
showing a balanced reduction in renal and CV events when both are part of a composite endpoint, or 
when early and advanced DKD sub-populations are investigated in a single trial, is considered to be low. 
Therefore, the Applicant planned to conduct two separate studies:

FIDELIO-DKD (16244): To demonstrate a beneficial effect on CKD progression in type 2 
diabetic patients with advanced stages of CKD (submitted in support for the initial market 
authorisation application). 

FIGARO-DKD (17530): to demonstrate a beneficial effect on CV events in type 2 diabetic 
patients with moderate CKD (submitted with the present application for variation)
CHMP considered this approach in principle acceptable and the similarity in CV and CKD effects in both 
studies should support that both studies are complementary for a renal indication. This implies that in 
both studies the primary endpoints should be positive, but at least the secondary endpoints should show 
a positive trend. This is considered important in terms of the requirement for two pivotal studies in the 
EMA guideline recommendations, considering that both a CV and DKD treatment indication are implicitly 
requested in the proposed indication. In a scenario with only one successful study, the evidence 
generated may not allow to support positive benefit/risk even if compelling data would be available from 
one trial, since both studies were seen to complement each other.
The CV primary endpoint in the FIGARO-DKD study was discussed at the advice. The inclusion of 
hospitalisation for heart failure in the otherwise thrombotic ‘MACE’ endpoint is not in line with the CV 
prevention guideline that recommends a composite of all cause death or cardiovascular death and non-
fatal MI and non-fatal stroke [EMEA/CHMP/EWP/311890/2007] and there were concerns that the 
additional component ‘unplanned hospitalization for heart failure’ is sensitive to differences in local 
practice. However, finerenone is expected to influence the pathophysiology of heart failure by 
antagonizing aldosterone, its effects are not purely anti-atherothrombotic. The Applicant presented data 
indicating also that the weight of hospitalisation for HF is considerable, quoting mortality rates for 
patients with HFpEF and HFrEF of 22% and 25% at one year (Bhatia et al NEJM 2006). Additionally, as 
patients with symptomatic HFrEF are excluded as this is a class 1A recommendation for MRA 
(spironolactone / eplerenone) treatment an HF hospitalisation would be a first manifestation of HF 
disease. While the Applicant presented data to suggest that HF hospitalisations will significantly contribute

to the primary event rate they are not expected to be the driving force of the composite events, but be in 
the same order as MI’s or CV deaths. CHMP agreed that an endpoint consisting of CV death, non-fatal MI, 
non-fatal stroke and hospitalisation for heart failure is considered acceptable.  
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP
The clinical study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki ethical principles and the 
ICH GCP guideline.
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects
This Type II variation contains data from the second pivotal finerenone Phase 3 study, FIGARO-DKD 
study 17530, that completed in 2021. No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, 
which is considered acceptable.
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment
The European 'Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use' 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00, London, June 2006) stipulates the requirement for an ERA for medicinal 
products licensed in the EU after 2006.  
In the EU, the medicinal product Kerendia® with 10 mg and 20 mg finerenone is already authorized for 
the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) associated with type 2 diabetes. The applicant now 
requests the modification of indication via this type II variation procedure, i.e., the proposed indication 
includes the prevention of cardiovascular (CV) events in adults with CKD associated with type 2 diabetes. 
The CKD population is proposed to be extended to all stages of the disease. The treatment area remains 
the same (cardiorenal). The recommended dose is 20 mg and remains unchanged compared to the 
already authorized treatment and ERA as of November 23, 2021. In this ERA in phase II, tier B the risks 
calculated for environmental compartments were all well below 1 revealing no risk to the environment. 
These calculations were based on the dose of 20 mg of finerenone and would thus not change due to the 
new extended indication of finerenone.  
Therefore, the current ERA as of November 23, 2021, is up to date and the recent new authorization 
application does not require a revision of the ERA.
The present Type II variation will extend the CKD indication to all stages of the disease, but the 
recommended dose remains the same. According to the Applicant, this extension of the indication will not 
push the RQ above 1 for the environmental compartments. As initially no calculations have been made 
available, this position was not accepted. The Applicant was asked to provide with detailed justifications 
to support the position that no new risks to the environment are anticipated due to the extended 
indication. The Applicant has provided an updated ERA in which the Fpen has been refined based on a 
European prevalence of CKD with T2D of 17 125 000 patients. The data used for the Fpen refinement is 
based on a publication by Deng et. al in Frontiers in Endocrinology where CKD-DM burden (incidence, 
prevalence, deaths, and DALYs) was investigated in four world regions using the Global Health Data 
Exchange (GHDx) query tool (doi: 10.3389/fendo.2021.672350). The peer-reviewed publication is 
considered an independent and reliable source why the data is considered adequate for the Fpen 
refinement exercise. 
The refined Fpen (0.0229) was used to calculate the risk quotients for the environmental compartments. 
All risk quotients are below 1 why no risks to the surface water, sediment, or soil compartments are 
anticipated. The general statements aimed at minimising discharge of unused medicine into the

environment have already been included in the PIL and SmPC 6.6.
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable. 
However, a new ERA statement has been provided. According to the Applicant, this extension of the 
indication will not push the RQ above 1 for the environmental compartments. As no calculations had been 
made available, this position could not be be agreed. The Applicant was therefore asked to provide with 
detailed justifications (including RQ calculations) to support the position that no new risks to the 
environment are anticipated due to the extended indication. 
In the response, the Applicant provided an updated ERA in which the Fpen has been refined based on a 
European prevalence of CKD with T2D of 17 125 000 patients. The data used for the Fpen refinement was 
based on a publication by Deng et. al in Frontiers in Endocrinology where CKD-DM burden (incidence, 
prevalence, deaths, and DALYs) was investigated in four world regions using the Global Health Data 
Exchange (GHDx) query tool (doi: 10.3389/fendo.2021.672350). The peer-reviewed publication was 
considered an independent and reliable source why the data was considered adequate for the Fpen 
refinement exercise. 
The refined Fpen (0.0229) was used to calculate the risk quotients for the environmental compartments. 
All risk quotients were below 1 why no risks to the surface water, sediment, or soil compartments are 
anticipated. The general statements aimed at minimising discharge of unused medicine into the 
environment have already been included in the PIL and SmPC 6.6.  
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects
There are no non-clinical objections to approve the present type II variation.
2.3.  Clinical aspects
2.3.1.  Introduction
The application is based on data from the FIGARO-DKD study.
GCP
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH.
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics
Apart from the FIGARO Phase III study which only included sparse pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling, there 
are no new dedicated clinical PK studies conducted/submitted by the Applicant for the purpose of the

current Var 2 procedure. The Applicant proposes several SmPC updates in 5.2 section, most of which are 
representing editorial changes. Overall, all proposed PK updates in the SmPC are evaluated as acceptable.
It is also worth noting that the Applicant is updating SmPC 5.2 section with the new information about 
finerenone interaction with rosuvastatin (BCRP and OATP substrate). This clinical DDI study with 
rosuvastatin (denoted as study 21429) was already submitted and assessed within the initial regulatory 
procedure Kerendia EMEA/H/C/005200/0000 | 5.4.1-2020-95063 | PRAC Co-Rapp + CHMP Rapp | CP | 
5.4.1 | Complete | NCE 8(3)/12(3). More details are available within the corresponding previous PK 
Assessment Reports D150 and D180. Therefore, no re-assessment of the mentioned DDI study was 
performed for the purpose of the present Var 2 procedure.
Finally, the Applicant has also submitted a new biopharmaceutic study within the module 5 of the present 
Var 2 application. This was a study 21325: Bioequivalence (BE) study (tablet: 2 × 10 mg vs 20 mg) in 
Japanese healthy subjects. This BE study appears to be outside of scope of the current Var 2 procedure, 
and results in no updates of the SmPC text. According to the Applicant, as stated in the Summary of 
Biopharmaceutics: “The study was conducted based on regional requests (BE study in Japan).” Therefore, 
no regulatory assessment of the mentioned BE study was performed for the purpose of the present Var 2 
procedure.
2.3.3.  Population PK
a. Objectives
The objectives of the PopPK analysis were to:

Characterize the PK of finerenone in patients from the Phase 3 Study 17530 (FIGARO-DKD, 
referred to as FIGARO) and identify relevant covariate effects to support the finerenone 
submission and labelling.

Provide posthoc estimates for exposure-response analyses, which are reported separately.
b. Data
The PopPK analysis was based on FIGARO, a Phase 3 study to investigate the efficacy and safety of 
finerenone in T2D patients with CKD. The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate whether 
finerenone is superior to placebo in delaying the progression of kidney disease on top of standard of care. 
A graphical representation of the study design is presented in Figure 1.
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023
Page 16/172
Figure 1 Study design Study 17530 (FIGARO-DKD)
Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either once daily (OD) oral doses of finerenone (10 mg 
or 20 mg based on their eGFR value at screening) or placebo in addition to their SoC therapy. Each 
patient in the Kerendia arm received 10 mg finerenone tablet OD (starting dose for patients with an eGFR 
between 25 to <60 mL/min/1.73m2 at the Screening Visit or 20 mg finerenone tablet OD (starting dose 
for patients with an eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2 at the Screening Visit).
There were two scheduled visits in the first four months after the baseline visit (Visit 1); thereafter visits 
took place every four months until the end of the study. Study drug could be up-titrated from 10 mg to 
20 mg from Visit 2 (Month 1) onwards, provided that potassium from the local laboratory was ≤4.8 
mmol/L and eGFR-EPI decrease was ≤30% below the value last measured. Down-titration or interruption 
of study drug was permitted at any time during the study for safety reasons.
Plasma concentrations of finerenone were determined for PK samples taken at different time points using 
a sparse sampling approach in all patients. Trough samples were collected at Visit 3 (Month 4). At each of 
the yearly visits, one blood sample for the determination of finerenone plasma concentrations was drawn 
during the visit after intake of study drug at home.
The final PK data dataset contained 8142 valid finerenone concentrations from 3102 subjects after 
flagging flagged to be ignored in the analysis (e.g. outliers, BLQ samples [labelled as MDV=1], etc) as 
shown in Table 1.

blue symbols: outliers identified with DV/PRED<0.02; green symbols: outliers identified by the sponsor

axis truncated at 36h
The model was mainly developed on an interim PK dataset including a total of 6337 finerenone 
concentrations from 3026 subjects with a data cut-off on Oct 7 2019. As the final final PK dataset (data 
cut-off on May 04 2021) became available, limited model development was performed to achieve a final 
model. 
The CHMP concluded that the database appears to be overall reasonable for developing a PopPK model. 
The study design included a different starting dose depending on the estimated eGFR at baseline. 
Furthermore, the study included a design element resulting in interruptions, discontinuations, and/or 
alteration of the dosing regimen, at the individual patient level, guided by measured variables (e.g. 
potassium). This should not have overall meaningful impact on the development of the PopPK model, 
however, this should be considered when assessing the subsequent exposure-response models.
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023
Page 18/172
Approximately 14.5% of PK observations were identified as outliers. These numbers were higher than 
those identified in the analysis of Study 16244 (FIDELIO-DKD) (12%) and Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies 
(3-4%). Outliers identified in Study 17530 (FIGARO-DKD) could not be explained by any of the available 
covariates and the Applicant assumed they were caused by deviations between recorded and actual 
dosing and/or sampling times. The most common reason for excluding observations were identified 
outliers based on a DV:PRED ratio outside of defined margins of 0.02 to 50. An additional reason for 
exclusion was observations flagged by the sponsor as “kinetically implausible”. These deviations should 
be better justified, since they could arise doubts regarding the appropriate data recording and collection. 
However, despite a large number of outliers, the data from Study 17530 (FIGARO-DKD) contained a 
similar pattern of outliers as observed previously in historical Phase 2a, Phase 2b and Phase 3 analyses. 
For this reason, the issue was not further pursued. Approximately 10% of the observations were excluded 
since they were below the lower limit of quantification which is considered acceptable.
c. Methods
A previous model based on data from the Phase 2b studies 16243 (ARTS-DN global) and 16816 (ARTS-
DN Japan) from PopPK report R-9603 was used as starting point for the analysis. 
First, the existing PK model was applied to the interim data (MAXEVAL=0 run) to evaluate its predictive 
power on FIGARO data. Subsequently, the model was optimized to the data from FIGARO, while keeping 
the previously identified covariate effects. Subsequently, the inter-individual variability (IIV) structure 
was re-evaluated and it was evaluated whether the covariate EGFRMD0 (on CL/F and F) could be replaced 
by eGFR values calculated according to the CKD Epidemiology Collaboration (EGFREP0 (baseline), 
EGFREPI (time-varying)) formula. The covariate effect relationships were described using a power 
function. 
Covariates were tested in a step-wise covariate modelling approach (see below). Potential time-
dependent changes in PK that could not be explained by time-varying covariates were investigated in a 
last step. 
The final PK dataset become available approximately at this stage where the comedication 
implementation was updated, re-investigating covariate effects for three comedication categories: 
CYP3A4-inhibitors (CYPINH), CYP3A4-inducers (CYPIND) and Sodium Glucose Transporter 2 inhibitors 
(SGLT), via a reduced forward inclusion-backward deletion procedure to result in a final PK model. 
The analysis was performed in NONMEM 7.5.0 using the first-order conditional estimation with interaction 
as estimation method. 
 PopPK model 20957 (report 13322) was overall well constructed according to the EMA guidelines 
relevant to population PK modelling & simulation (i.e. step-wise covariate analysis approach, model 
selection and acceptance criteria, simulation approach, reporting). Handling of missing data, data below 
LLOQ, outliers was described as well. 
The final popPK model was built on the basis of the one already run for ARTs-DN and ARTS-DN Japan 
phase II studies (report-9603, assessed within Kerendia initial MAA), which was subsequently optimized 
to fit with data collected through FIGARO phase III study. Model 20957 development strategy was also 
similar to the one already applied to perform PK analysis for FIDELIO study.
Purely in terms of popPK model building and construction, the approach of the Applicant is considered 
acceptable.
Covariate model development
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023
Page 19/172
The testing of covariates was performed using a step-wise covariate modelling approach. The covariates 
were divided in two groups, namely: covariates of category 1 which were to be included in the covariate 
analysis, and covariates of category 2 which were to be included in the statistical evaluation only if 
graphical exploration shows a potential effect of a covariate on the model parameter of interest (Table 2). 
Table 2 Overview of covariates of interest for finerenone PK, including variable names and aliases used in 
the analysis
The main covariate analysis was performed on the interim PK dataset. The comedication variables were 
re-evaluated using the final PK dataset. 
Correlated covariates have been tested, such as several highly correlated body size descriptors. This 
could potentially lead to selection bias and correlated covariate effects if two (or more) correlated 
covariates are included on a single parameter. The Applicant is strongly recommended to make pre-
specified decisions to include only one of several correlated covariates.
Model selection and acceptance criteria
Technical and/or statistical criteria were applied during model development and acceptance of a final 
model where appropriate. These could be customised based on the objectives of the analysis, limitations 
of the available data, and computational limitations, but in general the following criteria were upheld:


A convergence criterion of preferably 3 or more significant digits in the parameter estimation.
The model fit converged successfully to a minimum objective function value with, if feasible, a 
successful covariance step.
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023
Page 20/172





The standard error of a structural parameter estimate reported by NONMEM was preferably less 
than 50% of the estimated parameter value. This would imply the 95% confidence interval of the 
parameter estimate does not include zero, assuming normality.
The correlation between parameter estimates (structural and stochastic) as reported by NONMEM 
in the correlation matrix of the model output was preferably between -0.95 and 0.95.
The values estimated for η and ε, for each random effect, was preferably adequately centred 
around zero (with a reported p-value in the NONMEM output file of at least 0.05).
Shrinkage of the random effects as reported by NONMEM was preferably below 30% (η-shrinkage 
and ε-shrinkage).
Standard Goodness-of-Fit (GoF) plots, and other diagnostic plots relevant to the project, were 
inspected visually to evaluate the model fit, including Observations versus individual and typical 
predictions, Conditional weighted residuals versus time and Conditional weighted residuals versus 
population predictions
The obtained minimum value of objective functions was used to statistically compare nested models via 
the likelihood ratio test. In case of adding one parameter to the model (1 degree of freedom), a decrease 
of 3.84 points was considered statistically significant (which theoretically coincides with a p-value of 
0.05). In case of a comparison of models that were structurally different (and thus not nested), the 
models were compared using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).
In addition to inspection of parameter estimates and goodness-of-fit plots, according to the criteria 
described above, the predictive performance and robustness of the developed PK model was evaluated 
using prediction-corrected Visual Predictive Checks (pcVPC).
Overall standard model selection and model evaluations were applied which is considered acceptable.
Simulations
Two types of model-based simulations were then performed; 1) simulations to assess the magnitude and 
uncertainty of the pure covariate effects, and 2) simulations to compare the finerenone exposure at 
steady-state in subgroups of interest taking combined individual covariate effects into account. 
The posthoc estimates of the final PK model and simulated finerenone exposure parameters were used to 
predicted the area under the curve at steady state (AUCτ,md or AUCss) and maximum concentration at 
steady state (Cmaxτ,md or Cmax,ss) in subsequent exposure-response analyses. 
The workflow of the simulations is considered acceptable.
d. Results
Model development
The existing PK model slightly underpredicted data from Study 17530 (FIGARO-DKD). Other than that, 
the data were already captured fairly well by the Phase 2b model. Subsequently, model parameters were 
optimized to data from the interim PK dataset. IIV in Ka caused model instability, high standard errors 
(low precision) and high asymmetric shrinkage for the IIV term (η) on Ka. Therefore, the stochastic 
model was reduced by excluding the IIV term on Ka. The stochastic model included IIV on CL/F and Vc/F 
with a correlation (block) between them. 
The log-linear covariate effect relationships in the existing PK model were replaced by power functions 
which did not have a relevant influence on the model fit. In addition to this, covariate EGFRMD0 on CL/F 
and F was replaced by EGFREP0 (used in E-R analyses) which resulted in only a minor decrease in MVOF. 
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023
Page 21/172
Baseline eGFR-EPI (EGFREP0) was replaced by time varying eGFR-EPI values (EGFREPI) which resulted in 
a significant decrease in MVOF (ΔMVOF or dOFV=-49.0). The log-linear covariate effect relationship 
between WGHT0 and Vc/F was replaced by a power function which led to a minor decrease in MVOF of 
2.74 points, referred to as the base model. Reducing the model structure to a one compartment model 
significantly worsened the model fit resulting in an increase in MVOF of 483 points and was therefore 
rejected.
Covariates ALP, SMOK, HGHT, ALC, PROT, BMI, BSA, CREA and GGT were all included in the model based 
covariate evaluation, in addition to the predefined type one covariates (AGE, BW0, CPGH, CYPIND, 
CYPINH, EGFREPI0, EGFREPI, EGFRMD0, EGFRMD, ETHN, SEX, LBM, RACA and SGLT). The identified 
covariates were: 



body weight and CYP inhibitor on Vc/F. 
BSA, time-varying eGFR, SGLT, PROT and a reduced CYP inhibitor variable on both CL/F and F
ALP on CL/F
The development of the base model was based on a previous model as a starting point. The previous 
model was optimized and adapted to the current dataset. This considered a reasonable approach given 
the objectives of the analysis. 
The covariate analysis identified several covariates where most are considered overall reasonable. 
However, CYP inhibitor on Vc/F is not considered biologically plausible and is likely a chance finding, 
identified as a consequence of the observed data sample. Potentially, CYP inhibitor on Vc/F is 
confounded with an underlying effect on F, although it is highly questionable whether CYP inhibitor is 
identifiable on CL/F, F and Vc/F. A more reasonable approach would have been to not test CYP inhibitor 
on Vc/F. However, this is considered acceptable for descriptive purposes and for predicting individual 
level exposures for subsequent exposure-response analyses, and therefore, this issue is not further 
pursued. In case this model is used e.g. to predict the effect of CYP inhibition in settings outside of the 
current study, an updated model may be needed. 
Another limitation of the covariate model is the Applicants’ approach of including body size. Different 
body size descriptors are used for CL (BSA) vs Vc and Vp (weight). Preferably, the same body size 
descriptor should be used both CL and V. Within PopPK, body weight is the most frequently applied 
body size descriptor and is considered good enough for most situations. Furthermore, a standard 
approach is to include body size using an allometric scaling approach where all clearance terms (e.g. Cl 
and Q) are scaled using a single exponent. Despite these limitations, the developed model is 
considered acceptable for descriptive purposes in the setting of this trial, and to derive individual 
exposures for performing exposure-response analyses. However, these aspects should be resolved in 
case the model is used for extrapolation outside the setting of the clinical study which the model is 
based on (e.g. exposure predictions in paediatric patients or patients with high weight). The Applicant 
is strongly recommended to make pre-specified decisions to include only one of several correlated 
covariates in future applications. 
Final model 
The final PK model described all data from the final PK dataset adequately as shown in pcVPC plots 
(Figure 3) and GoF plots (not shown). All fixed-effect and random-effect parameters of the final PK model 
could be identified with reasonable precision, since the estimated uncertainty in all parameter estimates,

expressed as RSE was ≤31.3% for all parameters (see Table 3). The degree of η-shrinkage for CL/F was 
acceptable (24.4%) whereas Vc/F had a larger shrinkage of 46.6%. The relationship between preselected 
covariates listed in Table 2 and estimated ETA (η) values from the final PK model did not reveal any 
remaining trends of concern (not shown).

The Applicant states that all PK data were described adequately by a final model pcVPC. However, not 
all data are well described. At the later time points (~25-30 h after the most recent dose), the model 
slightly overpredicts the observed data whereas the drug concentrations during ~1-5 hours after the 
last dose, there is a trend of underpredicting the observed drug concentrations. One concern raised by 
the CHMP is that a two-compartment model is not fully supported by the observed dataset. Despite 
these signs of model misspecification, the model is considered acceptable for descriptive purposes and

for deriving individual exposures for exposure-response analyses. The outlined limitations will be kept 
in mind when making labelling claims for Kerendia and when predicting drug concentrations beyond 
~24 hours after the last dose.
The final model parameters were estimated with overall reasonable precision.
Simulations from the final model
The impact of these covariate effects on finerenone exposure at steady-state is illustrated in Figure 5. For 
continuous covariates, Cmax,md and AUCτ,md at the 5th-95th percentiles of the covariate distribution 
were within 80-125% of the exposure at the median of the covariate distribution. These 80-125% 
references were chosen as typical equivalence ranges. For the categorical covariates, the largest effects 
were found for CYP3A4 inhibitor use for >50% of the at-risk time when compared to no CYP3A4 inhibitor 
use (17.4% increase in Cmax,md , 13.8% increase in AUCτ,md).

the simulated 5th percentile, median and 95th percentile based on 10000 simulated PK curves). Vertical 
dashed lines indicate unity and general acceptance range for equivalence of 80-125%.
Model-based simulations were performed to compare the finerenone exposure at steady-state in 
subgroups of interest. Of particular interest were potential differences in exposure between races and 
ethnic backgrounds. These are graphically represented in Figure xxx. Although no RACE-based covariate 
effects were identified, differences between (sub)groups may arise from other covariates such as body 
weight, body height or eGFR-EPI. The ratio of the median exposure (Cmax,md and AUCτ,md ) for a 
specific racial or ethnic group, and the reference (subject with median exposure) is generally contained 
within the 80-125% range for both the posthoc based exposure as well as the exposure based on 1000 
trial simulations. The one exception to this is the "Other Asians" subgroup, for which both median 
Cmax,md and median AUCτ,md are just outside the 125% boundary. However, both values are within the 
5-95% variability range of the population. It should be noted that this is a relatively small subgroup 
representing only 2.2% of the total number of subjects included in the analysis. Other subgroups were 
explored in the same way and did not identify any differences of particular concern (not shown).

The Applicant has performed various simulations using the final model. The difference in AUC and

plots in Figure 5. In general, no differences were seen which would require an update of the dosing 
recommendations in the SmPC. Race was considered a subgroup of interest by the Applicant and the 
difference in AUC and Cmax for the available race categories were predicted. Overall, the exposures 
appear overall comparable between the race categories. As FIGARO includes more CKD stages 
compared to FIDELIO (considerably more patients with CKD stages I and II), the potential difference in 
exposure between CKD stages are considered important. An increase of trough concentrations of ~60-
70% were seen between moderate and severe groups compared to normal and mild groups which is 
considered reasonable given the study design and patient population. 
The individually predicted exposures which was used for the exposure-response analysis appears to be 
reasonable.

e. MAH conclusion
The final PK model adequately captures the PK of finerenone in FIGARO. The PK of finerenone is linear 
over the studied dose and time range, as was previously observed in Phase 1, Phase 2a, Phase 2b, and 
Phase 3 (FIDELIO-DKD) studies. Apart from the influence of EGFREPI on CL/F and F, the PK of finerenone 
in FIGARO was not found to be time-dependent.
For continuous covariates, Cmaxmd and AUCτ,md at the 5th-95th percentiles of the covariate distribution 
were within 80-125% of the exposure at the median of the covariate distribution. For the categorical 
covariates, the largest effects were found for CYP3A4 inhibitor use.
Based on simulations, taking the individual values of all covariates into account, median exposure for all 
subgroups of interest was generally contained within the 80-125% range, when normalized to a subject 
with median exposure in the FIGARO population.
The final PK model for finerenone allows estimation of the individual Cmax,md and AUCτ,md and can be 
used for subsequent exposure-response analyses.
The CHMP concluded that overall the final popPK model appears to be well constructed and suitable for a 
description of PK main parameters of finerenone in the context of FIGARO study, albeit some limitations 
found also in terms of exclusion of about 14.5% of PK observations, identified as outliers. However, such 
trend is in line with the previous model run for FIDELIO 16244 study (12% outliers). Also, the pcVPC for 
the final model shows a slight under-prediction in terms of 97,5th percentile observations around 10 
hours after administration (this is more evident in patients assuming a 20 mg finerenone starting dose) 
and an over-prediction trend for median values after about 25 hours from last dose. As these limitations 
are not considered crucial for the benefit/risk assessments of the current submission, these issues are not 
pursued further. 
In conclusion, the presented model describes the observed data sufficiently well and the analysis appears 
overall adequate for descriptive purposes and for predicting individual exposures for subsequent 
exposure-response analyses. In case the current PopPK model is used e.g. for extrapolation (simulations) 
in future Type II variations outside of the setting of the FIGARO-DKD study, such as paediatric patients or 
patients with higher-than-studied body weight, these issues will most likely have to be addressed. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling
Several different exposure-response analyses were performed as described below.
2.3.4.1.  TTE analysis
The objectives of this analysis were to characterize the relationship between finerenone exposure and the 
time to reach CV composite and renal composite endpoints, in combination with selected prognostic 
factors (PFs) in FIGARO. The following endpoints were investigated:

CV composite endpoint, which is the first occurrence of:
o
CV death
o Non-fatal myocardial infarction
o Non-fatal stroke
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023
Page 30/172
o Hospitalization for HF

Renal composite endpoint, which is the first occurrence of:
o
o
o
Kidney failure (end-stage renal disease or eGFR<15 mL/min/1.73m2)
A sustained decrease of eGFR≥40% from baseline over at least 4 weeks
Renal death
The objectives are considered relevant. However, it should be noted that this exposure-response 
analysis is not considered pivotal for the overall benefit-risk assessment in the current application. 
Consequently, this exposure-response analysis is seen as supportive and therefore, the analysis was 
not subject to a detailed assessment. 
a. Data
The analysis was based on interim (containing approximately 2/3 of the events) and final datasets, 
respectively. The model developments were mainly performed on the interim dataset and the models 
were then confirmed and finalized on the final dataset. The interim dataset and final TTE dataset used for 
the analyses contained all subjects in the full analysis set (FAS, 7354 subjects in the interim dataset and 
7352 subjects in the final dataset with two additional subjects prospectively excluded due to critical GCP 
violations). An overview of the event data used for the interim and final analyses is given in Table 4. Only 
the first occurrence of an event was taken into consideration. The dataset was adjusted to allow the use 
of interval-censoring in the analysis. As the day of a CV event was captured in the dataset, but the time 
was not, the interval was set to 24 hours (the day of the event). Renal events were visit related (i.e. 
mainly based on eGFR measurements). As, in theory, the renal event could have happened between 
visits, the interval was set to the last central lab eGFR measurement before the event until the event. As 
eGFR measurements at unscheduled visits were not included in the dataset, these were not taken into 
account for the interval. The observed KM curves for the renal endpoint stratified on UACR at baseline are 
shown in Figure 8.

baseline quartile 4 (739-7630]. Solid lines indicate the observed KM curve, number above the figures and

There were up to 4 planned visits (including randomization at Visit 1) in the first 4 months; thereafter 
visits took place every 4 months until the end of the study. Subjects could be seen at any time 
throughout the study, in addition to scheduled visits, at the discretion of the investigator.
The CHMP concluded that the observed data appears to be overall reasonable. Interval-censoring based 
on scheduled visits was applied for the composite renal endpoint, as the events were mainly based on 
eGFR measurements. Renal death is part of the composite endpoint which is an event expected to occur 
irrespective of scheduled visits. Therefore, the choice of applying an interval-censoring approach based 
on scheduled visits for the renal composite endpoint is not endorsed. However, since the events were 
reported to mainly be based on scheduled eGFR measurements, the overall impact of this issue is not 
considered to be major and this issue is not further pursued. 
b. Methods
The model development procedure described below was applicable for the development of models for 
both endpoints (CV TTE model and renal TTE models). The analysis was conducted in NONMEM 7.5.0.  
First, a placebo model was developed using only data from patients in the placebo arm. Significant

prognostic factors (PFs) (at baseline, except for time-varying eGFR-EPI for the CV TTE model) at the 0.05 
level, based on non-parametric Cox Proportional Hazard (CPH) analysis. This resulted in the full PF model.
Continuous PFs were included as exponential functions on the hazard. The explored covariates are shown 
in Table 5. 
Table 5 Overview of candidate prognostic factors, including variable names and aliases used in the 
analysis
The optimal parametric hazard model was then selected based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). 
Tested distributions included exponential, Gompertz, Weibull, log-logistic and log-normal. Subsequently, 
non-significant PFs were removed via a backward deletion (BWD) procedure using a significance level of 
0.01. This resulted in the interim placebo model.
Finerenone-treated patients were then included and the exposure-response relationship was implemented 
on the baseline hazard using the following Emax function: 
ℎ(𝑡) = ℎ(𝑡)𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 ⋅ 𝑃𝐹 ⋅ (1 +
𝐸𝑚𝑎𝑥 ⋅ 𝐶𝛾(𝑡)
𝐸𝐶50𝛾 + 𝐶𝛾(𝑡)
)
Model-predicted exposure as the continuous individually predicted drug concentration was obtained from 
the interim and final finerenone population PK (PopPK) models. Emax and/or γ (Hill coefficient) were fixed 
to 1 or estimated, if supported by the data. 
The CHMP concluded that the overall model development workflow is considered acceptable. Of note, 
both body weight and BMI were tested and as outlined for the PopPK analysis (see above) these variables 
are most likely highly correlated and testing of such correlated variables should preferably be avoided. 
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023
Page 33/172
However, either variable was selected in the current analysis and therefore this issue is not further 
pursued.
CV ER model
For the CV endpoint, an exponential or power model were investigated as well for exposure-response. 
Subsequently, any removed PFs (during the PF backward deletion step) were re-evaluated in the model 
and the hazard shape was challenged.
The development of the CV ER model appears to be overall adequate.
Renal ER model
A single Emax model, with or without Hill coefficient, could not adequately capture the observed trend in 
the data. Therefore, an alternative approach was taken, which was based on a population 
pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis of the effect of finerenone on UACR and eGFR-EPI in 
FIDELIO. In that analysis, the effect of finerenone on eGFR was described by a combined ’acute’ eGFR-
decreasing effect and a ’chronic’ beneficial effect of finerenone on eGFR decline. To reflect this combined 
effect in the TTE analysis of the renal endpoint, a double Emax model was applied which consisted of a 
hazard increasing effect multiplied with a delayed hazard decreasing effect. The possible effects of UACR 
and eGFR-EPI at baseline were tested on the EC50.
The development of the renal ER model appears to be overall adequate.
Model selection and evaluation
The following criteria were applied during model development and acceptance of a final model:




A convergence criterion of 2 significant digits
The model should converge successfully to a minimum OFV with a successful covariance step
The RSE of a structural parameter should preferably be <50%
The correlation between parameter estimates in the correlation matric of the model output, 
should lie between -0.95 and 0.95
Renal and CV TTE models were evaluated by means of visual predictive checks (VPC) with 1000 replicates 
using observed dose titration, dropout and treatment discontinuation.
The model selections and evaluations appear to be overall acceptable.
c. Results
CV composite endpoint
The base hazard model was described by an exponential model. The exposure-response relationship was 
described by an Emax model. Age, UACR, body weight, time-varying eGFR-EPI, HbA1c, likely Child-Pugh 
Score, history of CV disease, CYP3A4 inhibitor use, SGLT-2 inhibitor use and GLP-1 agonist use were 
identified as significant covariates on the base hazard. The parameter estimates of the final model are 
shown in Table 6. A VPC stratified on exposure quantiles are shown in Figure 9.

Next to the fit of the placebo data (grey), the finerenone treated subjects were divided in four exposure 
quartiles based on average concentration until (censored) event. The numbers indicate the ranges in 
μg/L. Thick lines indicate the observed KM curves and the ribbons indicate the 95% interval of the model 
predictions. In this plot, subjects who had a (censored) event prior to their first finerenone dose, and thus 
had no exposure to finerenone, were assigned to the placebo group.
The CHMP concluded that the final CV endpoint model is overall reasonable. The parameter estimates and 
associated parameter uncertainties of the final model are considered acceptable. Of note, CYP3A4 
inhibitor use was implemented using 3 different parameters (“weak 0-50”, “weak >50” and “any strong, 
moderate or unclassified”). CYP3A4 inhibitor use is already accounted for in the PK model used to predict 
drug concentrations and therefore, CYP3A4 was likely found to be significant due to association with the 
disease status of the subjects. This was discussed by the Applicant in the PopPK report and is not further 
pursued.
The observed KM curves of the subjects in the placebo group and with exposures in the lowest exposure 
quartile were close to the upper end of the 95% interval of the model prediction, whereas the observed 
KM curves of subjects with exposures in the two highest exposure quartiles, were beyond one year after 
randomization, close to the lower end of the 95% interval of the model prediction, which indicates that 
the treatment effect was overestimated.
The Assessor acknowledges that it is challenging to identify the true, underlying exposure-response 
relationship given the study design. The study design is not considered adequate to accurately predict 
exposure-response relationship given adaptive elements in the protocol, e.g. where subjects received a 
different starting dose depending on the baseline characteristics (eGFR) and dose titrations and/or 
interruptions were possible during the course of the study. However, considering that the model was not 
used to extrapolate efficacy data or to give dosing recommendations, the issue is not further pursed.
Renal endpoint
The base hazard model was described by an exponential model. A double Emax model was implemented 
in which a hazard increasing effect (ER1) was multiplied with a delayed hazard decreasing effect (ER2). 
The Emax of ER2 (Emax2) was parametrized as 1/Emax of ER1 (Emax1) as they could not be 
independently estimated with good precision. UACR, eGFR-EPI at baseline, race/ethnicity, likely Child-
Pugh score, CYP3A4 inhibitor use and SGLT-2 inhibitor use were significant covariates on the base 
hazard. UACR was a significant covariate on EC50 for the delay hazard decreasing effect. The parameter 
estimates of the final model are shown in Table 7. A VPC stratified on exposure quantiles are shown in 
Figure 10.

Figure 10 VPC of the final renal TTE model applied to FIGARO data from the final TTE dataset, stratified 
by exposure quartiles. 
Next to the fit of the placebo data (grey), the finerenone treated subjects were divided in four exposure 
quartiles based on average concentration until (censored) event. The numbers indicate the ranges in 
μg/L. Thick lines indicate the observed KM curves, and the ribbons indicate the 95% interval of the model 
predictions. In this plot, subjects who had a (censored) event prior to their first finerenone dose, and thus 
had no exposure to finerenone, were assigned to the placebo group.
The parameter estimates and associated parameter uncertainties of the final model are considered 
acceptable and the VPCs describe the observed data overall well for placebo subjects and across the 
exposure quartiles. As outlined for the final CV model, it is considered challenging to identify exposure-
response relationships given the study design, which should be considered if attempts are made to 
extrapolate these findings outside the context of the study design. 
The EC50 in the typical patient is the same for both the immediate and delayed effect components, 
respectively. The absolute Emax values are similar between the immediate and delayed effect 
components, however, each component operate in different directions (increased and decreased hazard, 
respectively). Consequently, the ‘net effect’ on the hazard is near null in the typical patient, whereas a 
subject with high baseline UACR is noted to benefit from the treatment whereas a patient with low UACR 
is predicted to have increased risk following finerenone treatment. Based on these model-derived 
conclusions, it could mean that the subgroup of patients in FIGARO with the lowest UACR values have 
limited benefit from the treatment, as seen in the renal endpoint (this is outlined further in the clinical 
efficacy assessment). Of note, these trends can be seen also in the underlying observed data according to 
Figure 8.
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023

d. MAH conclusion
The final CV TTE model captured the exposure-response relationship in the FIGARO population reasonably 
well. However, based on the VPCs, the treatment effect appears to be over-estimated to some extent, 
especially for subjects in the eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 at screening subgroup and an exposure in 
exposure quartile 3 or 4. Generally, patients in the eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 at screening subgroup 
with higher exposure benefited more from finerenone treatment in terms of reducing the risk for a CV 
event, compared to subjects with lower exposure in the same subgroup. The EC50 was estimated to be 
9.69 μg/L and the maximum decrease of the hazard was fixed to 100% (Emax). Based on typical subject 
simulations, the simulated duration above the EC90 within a 24 h dose interval was 2.0 h after 20 mg 
finerenone OD at steady-state. PFs with the largest effect on the baseline hazard were: History of CV 
disease, Likely Child-Pugh Score and Weak CYP3A4 inhibitor use for >0-<50% of the at-risk period.
The final renal TTE model generally captured the exposure response relationship adequately. Two Emax 
functions were needed to separate the impact of two processes on the baseline hazard: one to capture 
the increase in baseline hazard representing the ’acute’ effect of finerenone on eGFR and one to capture 
the decrease in baseline hazard representing finerenone’s beneficial effect on disease progression. UACR 
was found to be an important prognostic factor on the EC50 of the hazard decreasing effect (EC502). 
Generally, patients with higher UACR and higher finerenone exposure benefited more from finerenone 
treatment in terms of reducing the risk for a renal event, compared to patients with lower UACR and 
lower finerenone exposure.
Exposure-response relationships were identified between finerenone exposure and prevention of 
cardiovascular and renal events. Exposure-response relationships identified between finerenone exposure 
and prevention of cardiovascular events seem not completely reliable, since at highest exposure quartiles 
the treatment effect was overestimated. Therefore, the model should not be used for extrapolations or 
dosing recommendation. For what concerns the renal events, UACR was identified as covariate, indicating 
patients with higher UACR baseline values benefit more from finerenone treatment, while patients with 
lower UACR baseline values seem to show even a detrimental effect from finerenone treatment. This 
evidence is further discussed in clinical efficacy assessment.
An important limitation is that the results for both endpoints may be influenced by some adaptive 
elements embedded in the study design and, as a consequence, the final models should generally not be 
used for extrapolations outside the setting that resembles the FIGARO study protocol. As the analysis is 
seen as supportive evidence considered to have rather low impact, the results are considered acceptable 
as is.
2.3.4.2.  Potassium analysis
The main objectives of the potassium PKPD model were to:


establish a PopPKPD model to describe serum potassium concentration data and frequency of 
crossing pre-defined safety thresholds (>5.5 mmol/L and >6.0 mmol/L) in FIGARO, and
use simulations to assess the safety impact of switching to a serum potassium threshold of ≤5.0 
mmol/L to determine eligibility for inclusion and up-titration of finerenone compared to the 
FIGARO threshold of ≤4.8 mmol/L.
The first objective is considered the most relevant for the current submission and the only objective 
covered by this assessment. No updates to the SmPC is sought for an updated 5 mmol/L threshold and 
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023
Page 39/172
therefore, this objective was not considered crucial for the current submission. As a general comment 
and as outlined above, exposure-response is not considered crucial for the overall benefit-risk 
assessment and the analysis was not subject to a detailed assessment. 
a. Data
The final PopPKPD dataset contained a total of 205121 serum potassium observations (87691 local 
laboratory and 117430 central laboratory data) from 13112 subjects (7352 from PMx FAS and 5760 from 
screening failure dataset). In the subset of patients in the PMx FAS, there were a total of 196604 serum 
potassium observations (87691 local laboratory, 108913 central laboratory), of which 189254 were post-
baseline serum potassium observations. Of the 7352 subjects in the PMx FAS, 3666 were randomised to 
placebo, 1359 to finerenone 10 mg starting dose, and 2327 to finerenone 20 mg starting dose. There is a 
moderate to strong correlation between the local and central measurements (r=0.84).
The large size of the dataset is acknowledged. As the study design allowed dose discontinuations as 
well as (up and down) titration of the dose based on potassium measurements, the dataset is not 
considered optimal for identifying a “true” exposure-response, which should be acknowledged when 
assessing the resulting exposure-response model(s).
b. Methods
A starting point for the analysis was a base model that includes some of the key aspects of the previously 
developed FIDELIO PopPKPD potassium model (PKPD report R-13534). In this model, finerenone’s effect 
on serum potassium was characterized with a turnover model, with the drug effect being implemented on 
the hypothetical first order rate constant (kout), describing the loss of serum potassium, resulting in a 
finerenone concentration dependent increase in serum potassium (Figure 11). 
Figure 11 Schematic display of the serum potassium base model structure. The first order dissipation rate 
constant in turnover model kout is calculated as kin*BSL. The chance in serum potassium over time is 
calculated with the differential equation: 
𝑑𝐾
𝑑𝑡
= 𝑘𝑖𝑛 + 𝑘𝑜𝑢𝑡 ⋅ 𝐾 ⋅ (1 ― 𝑑𝑟𝑢𝑔 𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡) ⋅ (1 ― 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑒 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛)
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023
Page 40/172
AUCτ,md was used as driver of effect, and this effect on kout was characterized with an Emax equation. 
Additionally, a t-distribution was used for the residual error. The development of the FIGARO serum 
PopPKPD potassium model was carried out in four phases:
1. Structural model development, using central laboratory data from the PMx FAS dataset (baseline visit
and beyond)
2. Adding the local laboratory data from the PMx FAS dataset
3. Covariate exploration
4. Adding the screening failure data and the run-in/screening data from the PMx FAS dataset
A limited number of known risk factors for hyperkalemia were tested as potential covariates: age, 
baseline eGFR-EPI, baseline urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), sex, CYP3A4 inhibitor use, SGLT-2 
inhibitor use and Japanese ethnicity. The covariate exploration was performed on the dataset containing 
the local and central serum potassium observations from the PMx FAS dataset. 
The predictive performance of the model was evaluated using VPCs. Simulated subjects were screened at 
the run-in and screening visits according to the FIGARO protocol, and removed from the simulated study 
if they did not meet the serum potassium inclusion criterion (≤4.8 mmol/L). To adequately reflect the 
FIGARO dosing algorithm, the simulations for the VPC include simulation of dose-titration decisions on the 
basis of simulated local laboratory serum potassium observations. Finally, the occurrence of serum 
potassium retests (which were planned in FIGARO +/-3 days after hyperkalemia observations) and up-
titration visits (which were planned in FIGARO-DKD +/-4 weeks after up-titration) were also dependent 
on the simulated serum potassium observations and simulated up-titration decisions.
The applied model development and evaluations are considered acceptable. The Applicant made efforts 
to reflect the rather complicated dosing algorithm of the study protocol (including up- and down-
titration) in the simulations which is endorsed. To our understanding, dose interruptions/dropout due to 
high serum potassium occurred in the observed data based on potassium measurements which does 
not seem to be reflected in the simulations. Since this exposure-response analysis has a supportive 
role for the submission, this is however considered overall acceptable and this issue is not further 
pursued.
c. Results
First, the starting model was re-estimated on the FIGARO data and baseline eGFR-EPI was evaluated and 
included as a covariate on the parameter describing the baseline potassium level (BSL, dOFV=-292). A 
proportional difference between central and local laboratory data characterized the difference between 
central and local laboratory data. The distribution of IIV on Emax was changed from a log-normal 
distribution to a proportional distribution, in which the individual posthoc estimate of Emax can in theory 
also become negative. A disease progression term TSLOPE that was dependent on BSL was added to the 
model. This was considered the base model.
The base model was used for covariate testing using SCM. The covariates included in the final model were 
baseline eGFR-EPI on BSL, baseline eGFR-EPI on Emax, age on Emax, CYP3A4 inhibitor use on BSL, 
SGLT-2 inhibitor use on BSL as well as Japanese ethnicity on . As a model finalization step, a Box-Cox 
transformation was included for IIV on BSL in the final model (Table 8). A VPC for the final model is 
shown in Figure 12.

grey areas indicate the 99% interval of the same percentiles in the simulations, which include variability 
but not parameter uncertainty. Units of eGFR-EPI are mL/min/1.73 m2. 
The final model parameters and RSEs are considered overall reasonable. However, it is unclear how well 
the estimated exposure-response parameters (Emax and EC50) reflects the “true” exposure-response, 
given limitations of the study design (see above). Since the results does not warrant any changes to the 
dose adaptations based on serum potassium as outlines in the SmPC, this issue is not further pursued. 
The final model described the observed data overall well, according to a VPC.
2.3.4.3.  Exploratory ER analysis for safety endpoints
Graphical analysis for selected safety endpoints were provided. However, the visualizations should be 
interpreted in the light of the underlying complexity of correlations and interactions between the PD 
parameters as well as serum potassium- and eGFR-based dose titration.
eGFR: For eGFR, the change for baseline exposure-response analysis indicates an initial exposure-
dependent eGFR decrease along with a longer-term benefit of slowed eGFR decline.

No safety events have occurred in both the finerenone and placebo group together at an event rate 
greater than 10%. However, the analysis included all common safety events, except hyperuricaemia. The 
presented analysis display slight exposure-response trends for most endpoints, however no unexpected 
relationships were detected. Since the analysis has a purely descriptive purpose, no specific issues are 
identified.
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology
A key addition to the finerenone clinical development program for the current submission is the FIGARO 
study. FIGARO study included sparse sampling for PK in addition to measurements of several biomarkers 
and clinical efficacy and safety. The finerenone PK and PKPD relationships for FIGARO was mainly 
evaluated using PopPK and PKPD approaches. The assessments of these aspects are discussed below. 
FIGARO is a Phase 3 study designed to evaluate finerenone clinical efficacy and safety and therefore, the 
the PopPK and PKPD characterizations were not considered pivotal for the submission.
Pharmacokinetics
A FIGARO population PK model was developed using a similar workflow as for FIDELIO (included in the 
initial MAA). The objectives for the FIGARO PopPK analysis were to characterize PK, identify covariate 
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023
Page 47/172
effects and to provide individual exposures for subsequent exposure-response analyses. The data and 
methods used are considered overall acceptable. However, correlated covariates were explored during the 
covariate analysis. This could potentially lead to selection bias and the Applicant is strongly recommended 
to make pre-specified decisions to include only one of several correlated covariates in future submissions.
The final model included overall reasonable covariates, however, CYP inhibitor use was included on V and 
different body size descriptors were used for CL and V, which is not seen as optimal. The final model gave 
acceptable description of the observed data despite slight over- and underpredictions of the observed 
data at early and late time-points, respectively. These issues outlined for the PopPK model are not 
pursed, given the limited impact of PopPK for the current submission. The issues should however be 
considered in case the PopPK model is used in future applications, e.g. for extrapolations (e.g. exposure 
predictions in paediatric patients or patients with higher-than-observed weight).
FIGARO includes more CKD stages compared to FIDELIO (considerably more patients with CKD stages I 
and II). An increase of trough concentrations of ~60-70% were seen between moderate and severe 
groups compared to normal and mild groups which is considered reasonable given the study design and 
patient population. 
Exposure-response
Finerenone exposure-response relationships were explored for several endpoints including cardiovascular 
events, renal events, serum potassium, eGFR, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and serum 
sodium. As the exposure-response relationships were not deemed pivotal for the current submission, they 
are not subject to an in-depth assessment.
Time-to-event models were developed to describe exposure-response for the cardiovascular and renal 
events. The datasets used to develop the respective models and the model development workflows are 
considered overall acceptable and are comparable to the workflow used to develop corresponding models 
for FIDELIO. Finerenone exposure was found to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events using an Emax 
model with EC50 estimated at 9.69 ug/L. For the renal endpoint, a more complex exposure-response 
relationship was implemented. Baseline UACR was included as a covariate for the exposure-response and 
only subjects with high baseline UACR were predicted to have reduced risk of renal events. Subjects with 
low baseline UACR were predicted to have increased risk of renal events. This could mean that the 
subgroup of patients in FIGARO with the lowest UACR values have limited benefit from the treatment, as 
seen in the renal endpoint (for more details, see clinical efficacy assessment).
For serum potassium, a turn-over model was used to describe exposure-response where exposure was 
based on the individual AUC at steady state. An Emax model was used to describe the exposure-response 
relationship where serum potassium increased with finerenone exposure with the EC50 estimated to 
0.350 mg*h/L. It is unclear how well the estimated exposure-response parameters (Emax and EC50) 
reflect the “true” exposure-response, given that the study design allowed dose discontinuations as well as 
(up and down) titration of the dose based on potassium measurements. Since the results does not 
warrant any changes to the dose adaptations based on serum potassium in the SmPC, this issue is not 
further pursued. The final model described the observed data overall well, according to a VPC. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology
A population PK model and several exposure-response analyses were performed on data from FIGARO 
study. The population PK model as well as the exposure-response analyses are considered overall 
acceptable. Of note, limitations of the provided analyses are present. However, since the PopPK and 
exposure-response characterizations are not considered pivotal for the submission, the identified 
limitations are not further pursued. The application was considered acceptable from clinical pharmacology

FIGARO-DKD (Study 17530)
FIGARO-DKD (FInerenone in reducinG cArdiovascular moRtality and mOrbidity in Diabetic Kidney 
Disease), is the pivotal phase III study in support for this application for variation.
Methods
The FIGARO-DKD Study 17530 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group, 
multicentre, event-driven Phase 3 study in patients with T2D and CKD. A schematic description of the 
overall study design is given in Figure 17.
Figure 17. Overall study design of the FIGARO-DKD study.
Description of the study periods:
Run-in period (4 up to 16 weeks): Subjects with written informed consent who completed the Run-in 
Visit and met all eligibility criteria were enrolled into a mandatory Run-in Period, the purpose of which 
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023
Page 49/172
was to ensure that the subject’s standard of care therapy including treatment with ACEIs or ARBs was 
optimized and that all inclusion and exclusion criteria were met at the Screening Visit.
In the absence of documentation of diagnosis of high or very high albuminuria, the subject still could be 
enrolled into the study as albuminuria was measured at the Run-in Visit; in this case, the Run-in Period 
had to last for a minimum of 12 weeks and a maximum of 16 weeks.
Screening period (up to 2 weeks): At the end of the Run-in Period, a Screening Visit to confirm the 
subject’s eligibility took place within ≤ 2 weeks prior to the planned randomization. At this visit, it was 
assessed whether the subject still met all eligibility criteria.
For those subjects without a prior documented diagnosis of high or very high albuminuria, the Screening 
Visit had to be performed at least 12 weeks after the Run-in Visit, and albuminuria then had to be re-
evaluated. If the subject still suffered from high or very high albuminuria whilst on standard of care 
treatment, and fulfilled all other eligibility criteria, she/he could be randomized into the study.
Treatment period: Eligible subjects were randomized to receive once daily oral doses of finerenone (10 
mg or 20 mg, see below) or placebo in addition to their standard of care therapy.
There were up to 4 planned visits (including randomization at Visit 1) in the first 4 months; thereafter 
visits took place every 4 months until the end of the study. Study drug dose could be up-titrated from 
Visit 2 (Month 1) onwards or down-titrated at any point (even between scheduled visits). At the discretion 
of the investigator, subjects could be seen throughout the study in addition to scheduled visits.
It was planned that all randomized subjects remained in the trial until either:
a)
the projected number of subjects with a primary endpoints was reached, or
b)
the trial was terminated prematurely at the recommendation of the independent DMC.
It was planned that all randomized subjects, including any subject who experienced a prespecified 
endpoint event, should continue to receive study drug until the trial was completed provided there were 
no safety grounds for discontinuing treatment.
Discontinuation of study drug (for any reason) did not constitute the subject’s withdrawal from the study, 
unless the investigator believed that it was in the best interest of the subject or if the subject withdrew 
consent.
Follow-up: The period between the subject’s last intake of study drug and last visit in the study is 
referred to as the ‘Follow-up Period’.
For a subject who withdrew from study drug permanently but did not withdraw from the study, the 
Follow-up Period was the period between the PD visit (as soon as possible following permanent 
discontinuation of study drug) and the EOS Visit. For a subject who discontinued treatment at the EOS 
Visit, the Follow-up Period was the period between the EOS and Post-treatment Visits. All subjects who 
withdrew consent were followed up for vital status if they did not sign the ‘Declaration of Objection’ form. 
In addition, vital status could be obtained by the investigator from publicly available data sources. The 
collection of vital status had to be obtained within the timelines provided by Bayer. 
The CHMP considered that the overall study design was adequate, in line with the scientific advice 
provided by the EMA. 
All randomized subjects, including subjects who experienced a health event considered for the pre-
specified endpoints, continued to receive study drug until the trial was completed (provided there were no 
safety grounds for discontinuing treatment).

Figure 18. FIGARO-DKD: Background therapy with RAS blockade
Compared with the previous FIDELIO-DKD, study, FIGARO-DKD enrolled patients with a less advanced 
DKD still associated with high or very high albuminuria in order to enrich the population for CV rather 
than renal events. Patients in the FIDELIO-DKD trial with ‘high’ albuminuria (but not the ‘very high’ 
albuminuria patients) were required to have diabetic retinopathy, which was not required in the present 
study. In the previous FIDELIO-DKD study, the number of subjects with ‘high’ albuminuria and presence 
of diabetic retinopathy in the medical history was capped at approximately 10% of the total population at 
screening, thus, the study primarily enrolled patients with ‘very high albuminuria’.
The inclusion and exclusion criteria were otherwise in overall similar in the two studies and in line with 
the EMA Scientific Advice.  However, at the time the CHMP concluded the scientific advice, a confirmed 
risk factor for CV disease or at least 1 additional risk factor for CV disease was an inclusion criteria, which 
was omitted in the final study design.

Treatments
The starting dose of finerenone depended on the eGFR value at the Screening Visit (Table 9). Thus, at 
randomization, in addition to standard of care subjects with an eGFR between 25 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m² 
at the Screening Visit (central laboratory results) were assigned to the lower dose of finerenone (10 mg) 
or placebo, whilst subjects with an eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m² were assigned to the higher dose of 
finerenone (20 mg) or placebo.

The dosage in study FIGARO-DKD was the same as the dosage in FIDELIO-DKD study and in line with the 
currently approved SmPC for Kerendia.

from baseline over at least 4 weeks or renal

Endpoints of the study were in line with CHMP SA. The first secondary endpoint in the FIGARO-DKD study 
was the primary endpoint in the FIDELIO-DKD study and vice versa, otherwise the endpoints in both 
studies were the same with the exception of time to all-cause hospitalization and all-cause mortality 
shifted place in the hierarchical order.
Sample size
This was an event-driven study. Initially, it was planned that a total of 960 primary efficacy endpoint 
events were to achieve 90% power to demonstrate superiority of finerenone to placebo using a log rank 
test at a two-sided significance level of 5%, assuming a 20% relative risk reduction, i.e. a true hazard 
ratio of 0.80 (the hazard ratio that will be observed in the study will be different, i.e. closer to 1 due to 
treatment discontinuations). 
With an assumed study duration of 36 months (recruitment period: 18 months, equal recruitment 
pattern, maximum treatment period of the last subject recruited: 18 months), the planned total number 
of subjects to be randomised was estimated to be 6210 subjects, assuming an annual placebo event rate 
of 8%, a common annual lost to follow-up rate of 0.7% in both treatment groups, an annual finerenone 
discontinuation rate of 5% and assuming that placebo discontinuation was not to change the hazard. A 
total of 6400 subjects were planned to be randomised taking a certain ramp-up during recruitment into 
account. Assuming a screening failure rate of 50%, 12800 subjects were planned to be screened.
Due to the minimal effect of the interim analysis on the overall power of the study, an adjustment of 
sample size would be negligible.
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023
Page 54/172
The assumption of the annual placebo event rate of 8% was based on the results from the MICRO-HOPE, 
RENAAL, IDNT, ALTITUDE and SAVOR-TIMI 53 trials. Event rates were obtained from the respective 
studies in the arms where treatment would more closely resemble that in the placebo population of the 
CV-DKD study who were to be on standard of care treatment for DKD. Annual event rates for the 
composite CV endpoint range from 7-10% for older studies and 5-6% for more recent studies. As the 
anticipated study population was to be enriched for CV outcomes, an annual placebo event rate of 8% 
was assumed to be appropriate. The calculations of the required total number of events and subjects to 
be randomized were performed using PASS 11.
The study was event driven. A total of 6210 subjects were initially planned to be randomised in order to 
detect 960 primary efficacy endpoint events (CV death or non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization 
for heart failure) across both treatment arms during the assumed treatment duration of 36 months. For 
the calculations, an 8% annual event rate for the primary endpoint in the placebo group was assumed 
based on data from previous clinical studies.
The sample size calculation was revised with protocol amendment 3 (May 2017). According to the 
description changes were implemented to account for a lower-than-expected recruitment rate. With this 
amendment, the number of primary efficacy endpoint events was slightly increased (from 960 to between 
970 and 976) in order to achieve 90% power, the assumed treatment/study duration was increased from 
36 to 44-48 months and the planned total number of subjects increased from 6210 to 6212-6286. In 
addition, the number of sites required worldwide were increased.
Due to a lower-than-expected event rate, a further increase in the sample size was subsequently made. 
This did not lead to a change in the CSP which the applicant justified based on that this had no impact on 
the original planning assumptions, but the new expected sample size was added in the SAP (SAP version 
2.0, dated 29 MAY 2019.). For transparency and GCP compliance it had been expected that the final 
planned sample size had been correctly reproduced also in the CSP. The sample size increase by 
approximately 1000 subjects implied that the required number of randomised subjects was expected to 
be approximately 7400. In the end, 7437 subjects were randomised.
Similar changes for the same reasons were implemented also in the FIDELIO-DKD study submitted in 
support for the initial market authorisation application.
Randomisation
Eligible subjects were randomised 1:1 at baseline (visit 1) to receive finerenone (10 mg or 20 mg) or 
placebo in addition to their SoC therapy. 
The finerenone starting dose depended on the screening eGFR value; at randomisation, subjects with an 
eGFR between 25 to < 60 mL/min/1.73m² (central laboratory results) were assigned to finerenone 10 mg 
or placebo, whilst subjects with an eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m² were assigned to finerenone 20 mg or 
placebo. 
Randomisation was to occur within ≤ 2 weeks after the screening visit and was stratified by region (North 
America, Europe, Asia, Latin America and others), type of albuminuria at screening (high or very high 
albuminuria), eGFR at screening (25 to <45, 45 to <60, ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m²) and history of 
cardiovascular disease (present, absent; for definition of CV disease see table below).
The number of subjects with high albuminuria and eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 was to be capped at 
approximately 10% of the total population with high albuminuria at screening. The number of subjects 
with high albuminuria and without a history of CVD was to be capped at approximately 40% of the total 
population with high albuminuria at screening.
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023

Table 10. Definition of cardiovascular disease for stratification purposes.
The CHMP concluded that the randomisation procedure appears to have been appropriate. FIGARO-DKD 
and FIDELIO-DKD shared the same stratification factors except that in this study, patients were also 
stratified based on CV disease history.
Blinding (masking)
Finerenone IR tablets (10 mg and 20 mg) and placebo tablets were identical in appearance (size, shape, 
colour). The packaging and labelling were designed to maintain the blinding of the investigator’s team 
and the subjects. The study data remained blinded until database lock and authorization of data release 
according to standard operating procedures. Furthermore, measures were taken to maintain blinding of 
the study team while bioanalysis of PK and biomarker samples was ongoing.
Clinical Event Committee (CEC)
The independent CEC was blinded to study drug assignment and adjudicated all potential CV and renal 
endpoint events, as well as all fatal events and hospitalizations that occurred from the day of 
randomisation (Visit 1) onwards until the respective EOS visit for each subject performed following the 
study termination notification. To adjudicate eGFR endpoints, results of central laboratory assessments 
were available. Roles and responsibilities and details on the adjudication process were defined in the CEC 
charter.
The CHMP concluded that the blinding procedure appear to have been adequate. As in the FIDELIO-DKD 
study, for subjects starting on the lower finerenone dose, up-titration was allowed from visit 2 (month 1) 
onwards; for subjects in the placebo arm there was a sham up-titration. 
During the study and as reported in the CSR, there were 43 subjects who had their randomisation codes 
broken by the sponsor’s pharmacovigilance department for the purpose of regulatory reporting 
(finerenone: 14 subjects, placebo: 29 subjects). None of the subjects who were unblinded were excluded 
from FAS or SAF. According to the applicant there were no unblinding events reported by the 
investigators.

Statistical methods
The approved SAP version 1.0 was dated 03 AUG 2016 (same date as for FIDELIO-DKD). Following 
version 1.0, the SAP history and document changes have been described with the latest version of the 
SAP being version 6.0, dated 15 Feb 2021.
Analysis populations
For the statistical analysis, the following populations were defined:



Safety analysis set. The SAF comprised all randomised subjects who took at least 1 dose of study 
drug (except those with critical GCP violations).
Full analysis set. The FAS comprised all randomised subjects (except those with critical GCP 
violations)
Per-protocol set. The PPS comprised all subjects of the FAS without any of the prespecified validity 
findings.
For analyses based on FAS, all subjects were analysed according to the planned treatment group. For 
safety analyses (SAF), all subjects were analysed according to the actual treatment received.
Primary efficacy variable: primary analysis
The primary efficacy variable was the time to first occurrence of the composite endpoint of CV death or 
non-fatal CV event (myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for HF). All events classifying for the 
primary endpoint had to be adjudicated positively by the independent adjudication committee (CEC).
The primary analysis of the primary efficacy variable was performed in the FAS based on all randomised 
subjects except in case of critical GCP violations (added with amendment X).
Events for inclusion in the primary analysis were counted from the day of randomisation onwards until the 
EOS visit following the study termination decision, or until the date of EOS notification + 4 weeks if the 
EOS visit has not been performed. In the event of premature discontinuation from the study with no 
subsequent follow-up information, events were counted up to the day of withdrawal from the study or 
non-CV death. Randomised subjects without an event of the primary composite endpoint at the time of 
analysis were censored at the date of their last contact up to and including the EOS visit or date of non-
CV death. Subjects without any information about the primary composite endpoint after baseline were 
censored at Day 1.
Superiority for finerenone versus placebo was tested using a stratified log-rank test. In order to provide a 
point estimate of the hazard ratio and a corresponding two-sided 95% confidence interval, a stratified 
Cox proportional hazard regression model was used. In addition, Kaplan Meier curves were provided for 
the cumulative incidence risk of outcome events by treatment groups.
The primary analysis of the primary efficacy variable was repeated in the PPS as a supportive analysis. 
For the PPS analysis, the censoring rules for the primary analysis was restricted to events occurring up to 
30 days after last study drug intake.
Secondary efficacy variables: primary analysis
The primary analysis of the secondary time-to-event endpoints was conducted analogously to the primary 
analysis of the primary composite endpoint, with modifications to the censoring rules as the events 
differed.
Testing procedure and multiplicity adjustment
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023

One formal interim analysis was planned when 2/3 of the required total number of primary efficacy 
endpoint events had been observed. The testing procedure and multiplicity adjustment were pre-defined 
covering both the situation where a decision could be made to stop the study early for success and the 
situation where a decision was made not to stop the study early for success.
On 17 JAN 2020, the DMC communicated the decision to continue the study as planned without changes 
to the CSP.
Since the study could not be stopped early for success, the final primary analyses were pre-planned as 
follows:

A group sequential design with a single interim analysis when 2/3 of the information was available 
with a stopping rule of two-sided p <0.00270 required a small adjustment to the significance level 
of the final analysis (α = 0.04967388) to maintain the overall significance level at 5%.
A hierarchical testing procedure was used for the primary and secondary efficacy variables in the 
order below with each variable being tested at the adjusted two-sided significance level of 
0.04967388.

If the testing strategy stopped at one point due to a non-significant result, the testing of the remaining 
secondary efficacy variables was performed in an explorative manner.
Subgroup analyses
Exploratory subgroup analyses were performed for primary and secondary efficacy variables. These 
subgroup analyses included the randomization stratification factors. Analyses included descriptive 
statistics, graphical display of estimated treatment effects with 95% CIs in a Forest plot and a statistical

Supportive analyses to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the primary analysis were to 
be conducted for primary and secondary time-to-event endpoints.
Post-hoc analyses
Post-hoc analyses for demographics and efficacy were described in a separate SAP (version 1.0, 28 May 
2021). All analyses were to be conducted on the full analysis set (FAS) unless otherwise specified. In 
subgroup analyses for albuminuria categories at baseline, patients with missing baseline UACR or 
normalbuminuria were to be excluded.
Efficacy
Subgroup analyses of eGFR for baseline albuminuria (30-<300/≥300 mg/g), high albuminuria at baseline 
(30-<150, 150-<300mg/g, i.e. excluding ≥300 mg/g) and baseline potassium (≤/>4.5 mmol/L):
o Mixed model of eGFR by <subgroup>(FAS) 
o Line plot for least square means of eGFR absolute changes from baseline by visit and <subgroup>(FAS)
o Summary statistics for acute and chronic eGFR slopes by <subgroup>(FAS)
o Analysis of covariance for eGFR slopes (full analysis set) by <subgroup>(FAS) 
Continuous modelling of baseline UACR and potassium for 40% and 57% renal composites
o Hazard ratio for time to onset of kidney failure, a sustained decrease of eGFR ≥ 40% (or ≥57%) from 
baseline over at least 4 weeks, or renal death by continuous baseline UACR (FAS)

The FIGARO-DKD study shared a number of design and analysis features with the FIDELIO-DKD study. In 
that respect it is acknowledged that besides the different endpoint order, the two studies had slightly 
differently defined multiple testing procedures (MTPs). The MTP as planned for and used in the FIDELIO-
DKD study implied a weighted Bonferroni-Holm procedure for the primary and key secondary endpoint. 
However, as in the current study, only if both the primary and most important secondary endpoint 
achieved formal statistical significance, were the remaining secondary endpoints to be tested. As already 
commented on above; the first secondary endpoint in the FIGARO-DKD study was the primary endpoint 
in FIDELIO-DKD study and vice versa, otherwise same endpoints but time to all-cause hospitalization and 
all-cause mortality shifted place in the hierarchical order.
FIGARO-DKD completed on 02 Feb 2021. The latest version of the submitted SAP was version 6.0, dated 
15 Feb 2021. Final release of the clinical database occurred 19 April 2021. FIDELIO-DKD completed on 14 
Apr 2020. The changes made to the FIGARO-DKD study has thoroughly been accounted for in the SAP. 
Some were major, however none that raise any serious concern, and none that appears to have been 
inspired by the analysis of the FIDELIO-DKD study. 
Supportive analyses to account for the COVID-19 pandemic for primary and secondary time-to-event 
efficacy endpoints were planned (SAP version 5, 05 Nov 20202) and have been presented considering 
four different versions for the COVID-19 onset date (country-specific, global, individual pandemic related 
disruption date, individual COVID-19 AE date). The supportive analyses took only events that occurred 
before the COVID-19 onset date into account and implied exclusion of what appear to be proportionally 
not that dissimilar number of events in the two treatment arms. For the primary endpoint, the impact on 
the estimates were small but the p-values for the difference changed to being less favourable or no 
longer <0.05 depending on onset date definition where global and country-specific had a larger impact 
compared with any individual onset date explained by the difference in number of excluded events. Based 
on the supportive analyses performed on the primary endpoint, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic 
appears to have been limited.

EMA/41550/2023
Page 60/172
In addition, a number of post-hoc analyses have been performed for further assessments after subgroup 
analyses revealed treatment interactions (p<0.05) concerning baseline factors correlating with stage of 
kidney disease (this is further discussed below). In that respect, post-hoc analyses are appreciated. 
These post-hoc analyses were only briefly described in a separate SAP (version 1.0, 28 May 2021). 
Although the value of pre-definition is inherently less when it comes to analyses that by nature are data-
driven, the SAP lacked details. This concerned for example continuous modelling of baseline UACR and 
potassium for renal composite endpoints. Different models to characterise non-linear effects of continuous 
covariates exist. Hence, the applicant was requested to clarify how and why a cubic B-spline was decided 
to best fit the data and also to justify number of knots that have been noted to differ depending on 
baseline covariate and analysis (at least in pooled analyses of both studies). Recognising the exploratory 
objective, the brief description presented was accepted although did not add the details that were 
thought to be missing in the provided SAP. It is supported that candidates for knots were not only data-
driven but also based on medical judgement while the selection of a cubic B-spline function was 
considered as a compromise between smoothness of the curves and overfitting the data.  
Further, the applicant will be requested to clarify where to find the SAP for the pre-planned pooled 
analyses of FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD. The Applicant has confirmed that the SAP for the pooled 
analysis of FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD was part of report submitted with the application. This SAP 
was dated 24 FEB 2021 (version 3.0). 
Results
Participant flow
The FIGARO-DKD study was conducted in 1019 sites across 48 countries and enrolled 19381 patients. 
Screening failures occurred either during run-in or during the actual ≤2-week screening period. With a 
total of 11944 screening failures, the screening failure rate was higher than anticipated (50% assumed vs 
actual 61.6%). The remaining 7437 subjects were randomized, 3723 subjects to finerenone and 3714 
subjects to placebo. 85 subject IDs were prospectively excluded from the analyses because of critical GCP 
violations, resulting in a FAS population of 7352 subjects, with 3686 subjects in the finerenone arm and 
3666 subjects in the placebo arm Figure 20).

Figure 20. Subject disposition flow (FIGARO-DKD)
Treatment duration (from first to last intake of study drug) was similar between the finerenone and 
placebo arms. Mean and median duration of treatment in the FAS were 35.2 and 35.9 months in the 
finerenone arm and 35.3 and 35.9 months in the placebo arm, respectively.
A total of 81.1% of subjects in the finerenone arm and 80.7% of subjects in the placebo arm took the 
study medication for at least 24 months. Approximately half of the subjects took the study medication for 
at least 36 months (49.7% in finerenone, 49.9% in placebo) and approximately 30% of subjects took the 
study drug for at least 44 months (32.1% in finerenone, 31.8% in placebo)
The total exposure of subjects to study drug was 21593 patient-years, with 10802 patient years
in the finerenone arm and 10791 patient-years in the placebo arm.
The screening failure rate was higher than expected (50% assumed vs actual 61.6%). The applicant is 
requested to provide data on reasons for screening failure and discuss possible impact on the intended 
target population. It was clarified that the relatively high screening failure rate was related to an 
appropriate selection of patients within the target population.
Out of the 7437 patients that were randomised, a similar and low number of patients were excluded from 
analysis in the two treatment arms.  Thus, the percentage of randomized subjects that completed the 
study was high (98.9% finerenone; 98.4% placebo). Over 80% of the participants took the medication 
for over 24 months.

Recruitment
The FIGARO-DKD study was conducted in 1019 sites across 48 countries.
First subject, first visit: 17 SEP 2015
Last subject, last visit: 02 FEB 2021
Conduct of the study
Amendments
The original study protocol was amended twice globally (Amendment 3 and 4). In addition, two local 
amendments were made, only affecting sites in Japan and Turkey.
Amendment 3, was a global amendment of the CSP dated 02 MAY 2017
1) To account for the lower than expected recruitment rate, the duration of study and the number of sites 
required worldwide were increased.
2) To allow re-screening at an earlier stage and even if the reason for initial screen failure was an 
elevated blood potassium value, the re-screening rules were amended.
3) To allow randomization of patients with a recent CVD episode (i.e. those suffering from stroke, 
transient ischemic cerebral attack, acute coronary syndrome or hospitalization for worsening heart failure 
in the last 30 days prior to the Screening visit), the respective Exclusion criterion (#7) was modified.
4) In order to allow up-titration of study drug at any time during the study (from Visit 2 onwards), the 
instructions for up-titration were modified. Additionally, a requirement to specify the reason for not 
dispensing the 20 mg dose in the eCRF was added.
5) The recommended blood pressure targets after randomization were updated according to the most 
recent literature.
6) Definitions of the endpoint “kidney failure” and the definitions of cardiovascular disease history for 
stratification purposes were added.
Amendment 4, was a global amendment of the CSP dated 12 MAR 2019
1) To perform the Post-treatment Visit as a telephone contact for all subjects except those participating in 
the iohexol clearance sub-study instead of an on-site visit to minimize the burden on subjects, sites, and 
the sponsor. This change neither compromised subject safety nor scientific value.
2) To specify baseline values to clarify the handling of subjects who did not immediately start with study 
drug treatment at randomization.
3) To increase the time window after last study drug administration from 3 to 30 days for on-treatment 
efficacy analyses to better reflect the more protracted nature of the development and diagnosis of clinical 
outcome events of interest in relation to treatment exposure.
4) To provide a more precise wording about the type of discontinuation. It is the impact of permanent 
discontinuation of the study drug that is of particular interest.
5) To specify the definition of TEAEs to account for permitted study drug interruptions (i.e. temporary 
discontinuations) which might have occurred over extended periods
6) To specify interruption of study treatment in a similar manner as done for the AE presentation when 
analysing laboratory parameters
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023
Page 63/172
7) To delete some laboratory analyses (absolute value of serum potassium >5.0 mmol/L, relative 
decrease from baseline in eGFR of ≥25%, and increase from baseline in serum creatinine >0.3 mg/dL and 
>0.5 mg/dL) that do not provide additional clinically relevant information.
Baseline data
Demographic data and baseline characteristics are provided in Table 11 and Table 12 whereas the 
number of subjects with pre-specified medical history findings of interest is summarized in Table 13. New 
concomitant medication of interest during the study are presented in Table 14.
Overall, 69.4% of subjects were male. Most subjects were White (71.8%) or Asian (19.8%). A total of 
47.7% of subjects were from Europe, 22.1% were from Asia, 15.1% from North America and 11.4% from 
Latin America.
The mean age was 64.13 years. The largest proportion of subjects (44.3%) was between 45 and 64 years 
of age. The mean BMI was 31.43 kg/m2 (SD 5.99 kg/m2) and 24.0% of the subjects had a BMI of ≥35 
kg/m2. Mean SBP at baseline was 135.75 mmHg (SD 14.01 mmHg).
The mean eGFR value at baseline was 67.80 mL/min/1.73 m2 (SD 21.69 mL/min/1.73 m2). The median 
value of UACR at baseline was 308.18 mg/g (Q1-Q3 108.09-739.86 mg/g). Similar numbers of subjects 
were categorized as having high albuminuria (30 mg/g to <300 mg/g: 46.4%) and very high albuminuria 
(≥300 mg/g: 50.7%). Due to inherent intra-individual variability, a shift in eGFR and UACR categories 
between screening and baseline was seen.
The mean serum potassium value at baseline was 4.33 mmol/L (SD 0.43 mmol/L) and 28.5% of subjects 
had serum potassium values of >4.5 mmol/L, 5.8% had >4.8 to 5 mmol/L, and 4.6% had >5 mmol/L at 
baseline.
At baseline, approximately half of the subjects (45.3%) had a history of CV disease. The mean duration 
of diabetes was 14.49 years (SD 8.52 years) and mean HbA1c value was 7.72% (SD 1.37%). 97.9% of 
the subjects took anti-diabetic treatments at baseline, mostly biguanides (68.9%) and insulins and 
analogues (54.3%). The most frequently used non-antidiabetic treatments at baseline were RAS 
inhibitors (ARBs: 57.3%; ACEIs: 42.7%) and statins (70.5%).

Baseline characteristics were similar in the two treatment arms and was comparable to the previous 
FIDELIO-DKD study, except that mean eGFR was higher and UACR lower in the present study due to 
different inclusion criteria. Also, the occurrence of diabetic retinopathy was less frequent in the present 
study compared to the FIDELIO-DKD (App. 30% compared to 45%). Almost all patients had 
hypertension.   Approximately 40% of patients had hyperlipidaemia, 30% coronary artery disease and 
30% diabetic neuropathy. Although inclusion of patients with HbA1c up to 12% was allowed, mean values 
were app. 7.7% in both groups. Unlike the FIDELIO-DKD study, the FIGARO trial included patients with 
Stage 1 and 2 (i.e. eGFR≥60 ml/min/m2) that constituted the prevailing subgroup (around 60% of the 
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023

total population), while Stage 3 and 4 (i.e. eGFR<60ml/min/m2) were also included but contributed to 
40% of the total population. According to the inclusion criteria, patients with eGFR ≥60 were required to 
have “very high albuminuria” (UACR ≥300 mg/g), while “high albuminuria” (UACR 30-300 mg/g) was 
required for the lower eGFR ranges (i.e. Stage 3 and 4).
The number of participants with previous medical history of cardiac failure was 7.9% vs. 7.7% in the 
finerenone and placebo groups. The applicant was requested to provide details on the degree of heart 
failure for these patients. Also, given that the study was amended to allow inclusion of patients with a 
recent CVD episode, data on number of patients with hospitalization for worsening heart failure in the last 
30 days prior to the Screening visit should be provided. The applicant clarified that the FIGARO-DKD 
study excluded patients with HFrEF with symptomatic heart failure (NYHA II-IV) whereas patients with 
HFpEF and patients with mid-range EF could be enrolled. No further information appears to be available 
on these patients and the issue is not further pursued. In addition, the study was amended to include 
patients with a recent CVD episode. Only a very small and balanced number of patients had a medical 
history of HF within days prior to the screening visit (4 and 5 subjects, respectively, in the finerenone and 
the placebo group).
Approximately 45% of participants were from Europe, ~70% were White, ~20% Asian and ~4% Black.
All patients were on either ARB or ACEI. In addition, ~50% of patients received beta-blockers and 
diuretics and ~70% statins. 98% of patients were treated with anti-diabetic agents, ~8% of patients 
received SGLT2 inhibitors. Slightly more patients received GLP-1 agonists in the finerenone arm 
compared to placebo at baseline (8.4% vs. 6.6%).
Among new concomitant medications during the study, slightly lower numbers are noted for diuretics  
and blood pressure lowering agents in the finerenone group than placebo, which may be expected given 
the mechanism of action for finerenone. For other medications, similar numbers are noted.
Compliance and titration
With mean values of 91.478% (finerenone) and 92.883% (placebo), treatment compliance was high in 
both treatment arms (Table 14.1.8/34). Compliance values of 80% to 120% were achieved by 87.6% of 
all FAS subjects in the finerenone arm and 89.8% subjects in the placebo arm.
The mean average daily dose was 17.514 mg (SD 3.751 mg) in the finerenone arm and 18.156 mg (SD 
3.203 mg) in the placebo arm (Table 15). The mean average daily doses by eGFR category at screening 
were similar between the finerenone and placebo arms. The extent of exposure increases with higher 
eGFR at screening, with the subgroup of subjects with eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2 at screening reporting 
the highest exposure in both treatment arms.

EMA/41550/2023
Page 69/172
Table 15. Extent of exposure (SAF).
Table 16 summarizes the titration status by starting dose, the overall reasons for not dispensing the 20 
mg dose, and the overall reasons for down-titration or temporary interruption of study drug for the SAF.
In total, 1371 subjects (37.2%, calculated manually) in the finerenone arm and 1366 subjects 37.3%, 
calculated manually) in the placebo arm started study drug at 10 mg OD. 2312 subjects (62.8%, 
calculated manually) in the finerenone arm and 2292 subjects (62.7%, calculated manually) in the 
placebo arm started study drug at 20 mg OD.
On Day 1, approximately 60% of all subjects in both treatment arms started on the 20 mg dose. By 
Month 1, 70% of subjects were on the 20 mg dose. Starting with Month 4, approximately 80% or more of 
the subjects were on the 20 mg dose, which was stable for the entire course of the study thereafter. 
From Month 4 onwards a higher proportion of subjects in the placebo arm were on the 20 mg dose than 
in the finerenone arm (approximate difference of 5%). Only a very low number of subjects interrupted 
treatment (i.e., 0 mg) at any time during the study (approximately 2-3% both treatment arms).
Overall, more subjects in the finerenone arm (50.9%) compared with the placebo arm (46.4%) were not 
dispensed the 20 mg dose in at least 1 visit. The most frequently reported reason for not dispensing the 
20 mg dose was ”other” (31.6% in finerenone, 29.2% in placebo), followed by local potassium >4.8 
mmol/L (23.7% in finerenone, 15.5% in placebo). Down titration to 10 mg study drug (4.8% in 
finerenone, 3.4% in placebo) and study drug interrupted (10.2% in finerenone, 8.8% in placebo) were 
more common in the finerenone arm than in the placebo arm. An eGFR decrease ≥30% since the 
previous visit, symptomatic hypotension and other adverse or outcome event as reasons not to dispense 
the 20 mg dose were balanced between finerenone and placebo.

Table 16. Titration status (SAF).
The CHMP concluded that the compliance was high and similar (~92%) in both study groups. 
Approximately 60% of patients in both groups started at the 20 mg dose and after month 4, 
approximately 80% of patients were on the 20 mg dose. Of patients starting with the 10 mg dose, 
slightly more patients in the finerenone group than in the placebo group were never up-titrated (22.7% 
vs. 15.4%). A serum potassium level exceeding 4.8 mmol/L was an important reason for not up-titrating 
(23.7% vs. 15.5% in finerenone vs. placebo) and also an important reason for temporary interruptions of 
the study drug (12.4% vs. 6.7%).

The primary efficacy analysis was based on the full analysis set (all randomized subjects without critical 
GCP violations) that encompassed 99.0% and 98.7% of patients in the finerenone and placebo groups, 
respectively. For the per protocol analysis, 84.8 and 86.1% of the patients were included. Non-
compliance was the main reason for exclusion from the per protocol analysis (10.4% and 7.8% in 
finerenone and placebo groups, respectively).

Outcomes and estimation
Primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were included in a hierarchical testing strategy to account for 
multiple testing (see previous sections). The primary CV composite endpoint showed a statistically 
significant result (Table 18), meeting the primary objective of the study to delay the time to first 
occurrence of CV mortality and morbidity. With a p-value of 0.0689, the secondary 40% renal composite 
endpoint did however not meet the pre-planned criterion for significance (Table 18). Therefore, the 
remaining secondary endpoints all-cause hospitalization, all-cause mortality, change of UACR from 
baseline to Month 4 and the 57% renal composite endpoint were not tested formally, but in an 
exploratory manner.
Table 18. Summary on treatment effect estimates and test decisions for primary and secondary efficacy 
endpoints (FAS, FIGARO-DKD)
Primary endpoint
Treatment with finerenone reduced the risk of the primary CV composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal 
myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure when compared with placebo as 
shown by a HR of 0.87 (95% CI 0.76; 0.98, logrank test p=0.0264) (Table 19). The CV composite 
endpoint occurred in 458 subjects (12.4%) in the finerenone arm and 519 subjects (14.2%) in the 
placebo arm. The incidence rate for the CV composite endpoint was lower in the finerenone arm 
(3.87/100 patient-years) than in the placebo arm (4.45/100 patient-years).

Kaplan-Meier curves for finerenone and placebo diverge from Month 6 with a consistent course up until 
Month 42; thereafter the curves remain stable (Figure 21). The absolute risk reduction based on Kaplan-
Meier cumulative incidences for the primary CV endpoint was 2.0% at Month 36 and 2.1% at Month 42, 
corresponding to NNTs to prevent one primary endpoint event of 51 and 47 subjects, respectively (Table 
20).

composite endpoint (FAS, FIGARO-DKD)
Treatment with finerenone resulted in a 13% relative risk reduction compared with placebo for the CV 
composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for 
heart failure (HR 0.87 [95% CI 0.76; 0.98]; p=0.0264). The primary endpoint of the study was thus met. 
The Kaplan-Meier curves did separate starting 6 months after treatment initiation, which indicates a 
sustained effect.
The effect is driven by hospitalizations due to heart failure (HR 0.71 [95% CI 0.56; 0.90]; p=0.0043). 
The components non-fatal stroke and non-fatal MI were unchanged by the treatment whereas CV death 
was numerically slightly lower in the finerenone compared to the placebo arm (194/3686 vs. 214/3666 
cases; HR 0.90 [95% CI 0.74; 1.09]; p=ns).
Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint
Forest plots for the results by the stratification factors region, eGFR at screening, UACR at screening and 
CV disease history are summarized in Figure 22. A forest plot of other key subgroups is summarized in 
Table 21. An additional forest plot of the primary CV endpoint by GFR subgroups according to KDIGO 
categories is provided in Figure 23. The point estimates of the HRs in the various subgroups were 
generally consistent with the result of the primary CV composite. No treatment interaction p-values 
<0.05 were observed.

For the primary CV endpoint, the treatment effect appears in general consistent across subgroups, 
including eGFR categories, and there were no statistically significant interactions for the stratification 
factors or other key subgroups. 
For the stratification factor region, the treatment effect however appears slightly less pronounced in 
Europe (HR=0.95) than in the other regions. However, in the previous FIDELIO-DKD study, the effect on 
this endpoint was comparable to that in other regions, indicating a that the present discrepancy is a 
chance finding. For the pooled analyses of the studies (see below) no differences between region were 
found.
For history of CVD, the effect appears less pronounced in those with an absent CVD history (HR=0.95 
[95% CI 0.77;1.17] than those with CVD history present (HR=0.82 [95% CI 0.70; 0.96]). However, the 
baseline frequency for the primary endpoint is lower in individuals without CVD history making the point 
estimate less reliable. Furthermore, in the previous FIDELIO-DKD study, no difference between these 
subgroups was found for this endpoint.
The treatment effect appears reduced in subjects with low BMI (HR = 1 [95% CI 0.82; 1.22] vs HR = 
0.78 [95% CI 0.66; 0.92]). The interaction was however not significant and in the previous FIDELIO-DKD 
study, there was instead a tendency for a more pronounced effect in these subjects.
Secondary endpoints
First secondary 40% renal composite
Treatment with finerenone led to a lower incidence rate for the secondary 40% renal composite endpoint 
when compared with placebo as shown by a HR of 0.87 (95% CI 0.76;1.01) (Table 22). The RRR of 13% 
in the 40% renal composite endpoint did not meet the pre-specified threshold for statistical significance 
(logrank test p=0.0689). Kaplan-Meier curves are provided in Figure 24.
The 40% renal composite endpoint occurred in 350 subjects (9.5%) in the finerenone arm and 395 
subjects (10.8%) in the placebo arm. Incidence rates for the 40% renal composite endpoint were 
3.15/100 patient-years in the finerenone arm and 3.58/100 patient years in the placebo arm.

Treatment with finerenone resulted in a 13% relative hazard reduction compared with placebo of the first 
secondary 40% renal composite endpoint (HR 0.87 [95% CI 0.76; 1.01] p=0.0689]) but the result did 
however not reach statistical significance. When analysing the components, directionally consistent 
changes in kidney failure and sustained decrease in eGFR ≥40% (relative to baseline) were observed. For 
renal death, too few cases occurred (2 in the placebo group) to draw any conclusions. The Kaplan-Meier 
curves did separate after 24 months and indicate a sustained effect after this timepoint. 
In the previous FIDELIO-DKD study, a sustained effect was also noted, but with an earlier curve 
separation at 12 months. 
Given that the secondary 40% renal composite endpoint did not meet the pre-planned criterion for 
significance, the remaining secondary endpoints were not tested formally, but in an exploratory manner.
All-cause hospitalization
For all-cause hospitalization, the comparison of finerenone with placebo showed a HR of 0.97
(95% CI 0.90;1.04, logrank test nominal p=0.3558) (Table 23). Statistical testing was performed in
an exploratory manner. Further information on the components is presented in Table 24.

All-cause mortality
For all-cause mortality, the comparison of finerenone with placebo showed a HR of 0.89 (95% CI 
0.77;1.04, logrank test p=0.1337). There were 333 subjects (9.0%) in the finerenone arm and 370 
subjects (10.1%) in the placebo arm who died (Table 25). The incidence rates for all-cause mortality 
were 2.68/100 patient-years (finerenone) and 3.01/100 patient-years (placebo).
For all-cause mortality Kaplan-Meier curves for finerenone and placebo start to diverge at Month 12 
(Figure 25). The absolute risk reduction was 1.3% at Month 36 and 1.8% at Month 42, corresponding to 
NNTs to prevent one death of 75 and 55 subjects, respectively.
Follow-up information for all-cause mortality was complete for almost all subjects (96.9% in the 
finerenone arm, 97.3% in the placebo arm).

Change in UACR from baseline to Month 4
Finerenone led to a larger UACR reduction from baseline to Month 4 than placebo. At Month 4, the 
geometric mean of the ratio to baseline was 0.624 (geometric SD 2.462) in the finerenone arm compared 
to 0.922 (geometric SD 2.362) in the placebo arm.
For the change in UACR from baseline to Month 4 (closest visit), the comparison of finerenone versus 
placebo by ANCOVA resulted in a ratio of LS-means of 0.676 (95% CI 0.650, 0.704, nominal p-value of F-
test <0.0001).
Secondary 57% renal composite
The 57% renal composite endpoint was defined as time to onset of kidney failure, a sustained decrease of 
eGFR ≥57% from baseline over at least 4 weeks, or renal death. Compared to the secondary 40% renal 
composite endpoint, the 57% renal composite endpoint considered a greater sustained decrease in eGFR 
of 57%, which is equivalent to a doubling of serum creatinine.
For the 57% composite endpoint the comparison of finerenone with placebo showed a HR of 0.77 (95% 
CI 0.60;0.99, logrank test p=0.0406). Statistical testing was performed in an explorative manner.

Given that the secondary 40% renal composite endpoint did not meet the pre-planned criterion for 
significance, the remaining secondary endpoints were not tested formally, but in an exploratory manner. 
Finerenone had no effect on all-cause hospitalisation (HR = 0.97 [95% CI 0.90;1.04]; logrank test 
nominal p=0.3558) but had an effect on the component hospitalization due to heart failure, as previously 
discussed in relation to the primary composite endpoint. Of note, numerically, non-heart failure related 
CV hospitalisations were slightly higher in the finerenone compared to the placebo group.
For all-cause mortality, finerenone treatment resulted in a 11% relative risk reduction compared to 
placebo, however the difference was not significant (HR = 0.89 [95% CI 0.77;1.04]; logrank test nominal 
p=0.1337) but indicates no general detrimental effect of the treatment, in line with previous findings 
from the FIDELIO-DKD study.
UACR from baseline to month 4 was reduced in the finerenone group compared to placebo (ratio of LS-
means=0.676 [95% CI 0.650; 0.704]; nominal p-value of F-test <0.0001) which is in line with the 
treatment effect observed in the previous FIDELIO-DKD study and supports the renoprotective mode of 
action. 
The secondary 57% renal composite defined a more pronounced eGFR decrease that corresponds to a 
doubling of serum creatinine, compared to the primary endpoint that involved a ≥40% reduction. 
Treatment with finerenone resulted in a 23% relative hazard reduction compared with placebo (HR 0.77 
[95% CI 0.60;0.99]; logrank test nominal p=0.0406) i.e. a similar risk reduction as seen in the previous 
FIDELIO-DKD study, providing support for renoprotection.

Subgroup analyses of the secondary 40% and 57% renal composite endpoints
As the renal composite endpoints differed only in the laboratory component sustained decrease of eGFR 
≥40% or ≥57% from baseline over at least 4 weeks, their subgroup results are described together to 
facilitate the interpretation. A forest plot by stratification factors is provided in Figure 27.
Figure 27. Forest plots for the secondary efficacy renal composite endpoints of onset of kidney failure, 
sustained decrease of eGFR ≥40% (or ≥57%) from baseline over at least 4 weeks, or renal death by 
stratification factors (FAS).
Treatment interaction p-values <0.05 only for one but not the other renal composite endpoint and/or 
inconsistent courses of the HRs were not considered a relevant heterogeneity by the applicant. This 
applies to the subgroup factors waist circumference at baseline, ACEI use (or no ARB use) and quartiles 
of baseline HbA1c.
Based on treatment interaction p-values <0.05 for both renal composite endpoints, a potential 
heterogeneity in finerenone’s treatment effect was indicated for subgroup factors by albuminuria, eGFR, 
serum potassium at baseline, region and race.
In FIGARO-DKD, due to the inclusion criteria there was a distinct relationship between albuminuria and 
eGFR at screening: the subgroup of high albuminuria corresponded to subjects with lower range of eGFR 
of ≥25 to ≤90 mL/min/1.73 m2 whereas the subgroup of very high albuminuria corresponded to subjects 
with higher eGFR of ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2.
To explore a potential heterogeneity of the treatment effect that was indicated for eGFR and albuminuria 
by the main subgroup analyses of both renal composite endpoints in relation to the above-mentioned 
inclusion criteria, post-hoc subgroup analyses by eGFR were conducted separately for the discrete 
subgroups high and very high albuminuria at baseline. Since there may be further correlations, subgroup 
analyses split by albuminuria categories were also conducted for serum potassium at baseline, region and 
race subgroups and in short showed the following results:
By high vs very high albuminuria: Heterogeneity of treatment effects for albuminuria was observed in 
subgroups of the 40% and the 57% renal composite endpoints (Figure 27). Irrespective of categories of 
eGFR, baseline potassium, region and race, the treatment effect of finerenone was stronger (i.e. a lower 
HR) in the ‘very high’ albuminuria subgroup than the ‘high’ albuminuria subgroups. In addition, 
continuous modelling was done using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model with covariates 
treatment, a cubic B-spline of baseline UACR and its interaction with treatment. For the 40% renal 
composite the fitted curve indicates HRs <1.0 for baseline UACR values >400 mg/g (Figure 28). For the 
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023
Page 84/172
57% renal composite endpoint, HRs <1.0 are already seen for baseline UACR values >200 mg/g (Figure 
29). The confidence intervals for lower UACR values included unity for both renal composite endpoints; 
for the 57% renal composite endpoint also the overall treatment effect of HR 0.77 of the primary analysis 
was included.
Comparable with the overall population, analyses of eGFR decrease over time show an acute reduction in 
eGFR for subjects in the high and very high albuminuria categories, which is most pronounced at Month 1 
and ameliorates from Month 4 onwards (Figure 30). While a stronger finerenone treatment effect on the 
total eGFR slope was observed earlier (as shown by a crossover of the curves at Month 24) for subjects in 
the very high albuminuria subgroup compared to those with high albuminuria (no crossover up until 
Month 48), a preservation of the chronic eGFR slope decline (from Month 4 onwards) was observed for all 
subjects as judged by positive values for chronic slope differences.

Various eGFR categories: Subgroup analysis indicate a heterogeneity in the response regarding 
screening eGFR for both the 40% and 57% renal endpoints (reduced treatment effect in the 45-60 
mL/min group) (see Figure 31 for an overview of GFR by different subgroups at screening/baseline). 
However, according to the applicant, results of the post-hoc analyses do not support the potential 
treatment effect heterogeneity for eGFR that was indicated by the main subgroup analysis. Within the 
‘high’ and the ‘very high’ albuminuria subgroups there was no interaction of baseline eGFR with the 
treatment effect (as shown by treatment interaction p-values >0.05 for both renal composite endpoints, 
Figure 32). This suggests that finerenone delays progression of kidney disease consistently across the 
studied range of eGFR and that the observed heterogeneity in the treatment effect is likely to be 
attributed to albuminuria.

Serum potassium categories at baseline: The treatment effect heterogeneity observed for serum 
potassium (Figure 33) cannot primarily be explained by albuminuria. In general, lower HR values were 
associated with lower potassium categories. A stratified Cox proportional hazards model was fitted with 
covariates treatment, a cubic B-spline of baseline serum potassium and its interaction with treatment. For 
the 40% renal composite, the fitted curve indicates HRs <1.0 for all but baseline serum potassium values 
>4.8 mmol/L (Figure 34). For the 57% renal composite, HRs <1.0 are seen for all baseline serum

the confidence intervals included the respective overall treatment effect of the primary analysis of HR

Region and race: The trend for a more expressed treatment effect of finerenone in the region Asia and 
in Asian subjects seen in the main subgroup analysis was also seen in the subgroup analyses of both 
renal endpoints by high or very high albuminuria. The proportion of very high albuminuria was only 
slightly higher in Asia (53.4%) than in the overall population (50.7%), indicating that the treatment 
heterogeneity cannot be primarily attributed to albuminuria, but also to region and race.
The CHMP assessment of the secondary endpoints 
For screening eGFR, given the inclusion criteria, most patients were in the ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2 group. A 
positive treatment effect was shown in this group as well as the 25-45 group. However, finerenone 
treated patients in the 45-60 group displayed an increased HR (1.62 [95% CI 1.12; 2.34]) for both the 
40% and the 57% endpoints compared to the other GFR categories. Given that most patients in this GFR 
subgroup had ‘high’ albuminuria, the increased HR may be related to the degree of albuminuria rather 
than GFR. This is supported by data from the FIDELIO-DKD trial that showed no heterogeneity with 
regards to GFR. However, given that the applicant proposes an extended indication to encompass all 
stages of CKD, further justification was requested for the renoprotective effect for all GFR categories.
The overall HR for the 40% renal composite was 0.87 (95% CI 0.76; 1.01 p=ns). In subgroups of CKD 1 
and 2, HR was 0.78 (95% CI 0.53; 1.14) and 0.80 (95% CI 0.65; 0.98) i.e a treatment effect in the same 
range as the overall effect previously found in the FIDELIO-DKD study. Compared to the FIDELIO-DKD 
study, the FIGARO-DKD study enrolled a population with less advanced kidney disease. The renal event 
rate was therefore lower, and it is acknowledged that the statistical power to demonstrate a treatment 
effect in this population is affected. In line with the CHMP’s opinion given in the SA, lack of statistical 
significance in the FIGARO results is not considered a main limiting factor to the pursued extension of 
indication, considering that a positive trend favouring finerenone over placebo has been demonstrated in 
the study population including Stage 1 and 2. Thus, it can be agreed that the eGFR category does not 
seem to produce heterogeneity in response, as also confirmed by the lack of statistical interaction 
between renal function and clinical outcomes in the presented pooled analysis. 
The pooled analysis is in general in support for an effect across the different KDIGO categories, including 
CKD stage 1 and 2 for which extension of indication is sought.
For the 40% and 57% renal endpoints, the treatment effect was reduced in subjects with ‘high’ 
albuminuria compared to ‘very high’ albuminuria. The HRs for the 40% renal endpoint was 1.16 [95% CI 
0.91; 1.47] compared to 0.74 [95% CI 0.62; 0.90]. The FIGARO-DKD study enrolled patients with high’ 
albuminuria (30 mg/g - 300 mg/g) and eGFR 25-90 OR patients with‘very high’albuminuria (≥300 mg/g) 
and eGFR ≥60. When interpreting data, there is thus both a biological relation between eGFR and 
albuminuria as well as a relationship due to the inclusion criteria. The effect of albuminuria however 
appears independent of GFR since the point estimates subjects with ‘high’ albuminuria were equal to or 
above 1 in all GFR categories whereas a beneficial effect was noted in GFR subgroups with ‘very high’ 
albuminuria. For the 57% endpoint, the same pattern was seen but the estimate is more uncertain given 
the generally lower incidence in the placebo group compared to the incidence for the 40% endpoint (5.02 
vs. 2.3 n/100 p-yrs). In the previous FIDELIO-DKD study, few participants with ’high’ albuminuria were 
enrolled since recruitment was capped at app. 10%, thus no reliable estimate of the effect in this group is 
available previously. A further post-hoc analysis using modelling indicates HRs >1 for the 40% renal 
endpoint for baseline UACR values below app. 400 mg/g. Also, a model-based exposure-response 
analysis for renal events indicated increased risk of renal events for finerenone treated subjects versus 
placebo for patients with baseline UACR below app. 400 mg/g. Furthermore, when eGFR curves are 
plotted for these subgroups, the treatment effect appears more pronounced in the ‘very high’ albuminuria 
group as shown by crossing of the curves at month 24 while no crossing of the curves is observed in the 
‘high’ albuminuria group. Thus, it was discussed if the FIGARO trial provides evidence for a favourable 
Assessment report

effect of finerenone on renal endpoints across all different eGFR ranges (from Stage 1 to Stage 4) but 
only in patients with “very high” albuminuria, since an opposite trend emerges in the group with “high” 
albuminuria. 
Following the assessment of the responses the CHMP concluded that regarding renal endpoints, there was 
a marked heterogeneity regarding albuminuria for the 40% renal endpoint in the FIGARO-DKD study (HR 
= 1.16 [0.91; 1.47] for the “high” subgroup). No reliable estimate is available for the secondary 57% 
renal endpoint given low number of events. For the secondary endpoint UACR at month 4, a similar 
reduction was found in both the “high” and “very high” subgroups. Additional explorative data provided in 
the response shows a sustained reduction of albuminuria in both subgroups up to 36 months. For the 
exploratory analysis of the chronic eGFR slope, there was a positive effect on the slope in both subgroups 
compared to placebo, but the magnitude was reduced in patients in the “high” compared to the “very 
high” subgroup which may be expected given the lower progression rate of renal dysfunction in these 
patients. Thus, the bulk of data suggest no treatment effect on renal endpoints during the follow up time 
(up to 54 months; average treatment time 35 months) but the effect on GFR slope and UACR may 
indicate a future beneficial effect not yet seen in clinical endpoints.
Safety data may indicate a slight imbalance of serious drug-related AEs in the subgroup of patients with 
“high albuminuria”; however, this may be driven by the lower eGFR (<60) in the majority of subjects 
(66%) in the pooled analysis of data from FIDELIO and FIAGRO. In the subgroup of patients with “very 
high” albuminuria, 55% of the patients had an eGFR <60 and 45% had an eGFR >60.
For the primary CV endpoint, no heterogeneity regarding albuminuria was observed for the CV endpoints 
(0.87 vs. 0.90 for “high” vs. “very high”, respectively). The effect was driven by hospitalisations for heart 
failure but observed in a population without previous symptomatic heart failure (NYHA II-IV). In an 
exploratory post hoc “net clinical benefit” analysis, including both renal and CV events and also 
accounting for events of hyperkalaemia, HR < 1 were observed in both subgroups.
Taken together, the response on the renal clinical endpoints display heterogeneity concerning albuminuria 
however explorative data suggest possible future beneficial effects not yet seen during the follow up time. 
Finerenone had a beneficial effect on the primary CV endpoint in the FIGARO-DKD study, regardless of 
baseline albuminuria status. Thus, the totality of data, including findings from post hoc analyses, support 
that patients with both “high” and “very high” albuminuria benefit from the treatment.
The FIGARO study showed heterogeneity of response by potassium level in the overall population. For the 
40% endpoint, the HR in patients with potassium >4.3 mM was 1.06 [95% CI 0.85; 1.32] compared to 
0.75 [95% CI 0.62; 0.91] for patients ≤4.3 mM. The heterogeneity was still present when data was 
stratified by a higher cut-off of 4.5 mM (HR 0.77 vs. 1.24) however the estimate in the subgroup >4.5 
mM is less reliable given fewer number of patients. When analyzing the GFR slopes in data stratified by a 
cut-off of 4.5 mM, the finerenone and the placebo curves cross at month 36 in the subgroup ≤4.5mM 
whereas no clear crossing of the curves was seen in the subgroup ≥4.5mM. However, the fewer number 
of patients in the ≥4.5mM group may have affected the appearance of the curve.  A further post-hoc 
analysis using modelling indicates a better treatment effect (i.e. lower HRs) in patients with a lower 
baseline potassium whereas patients with serum potassium above 4.8 displayed a HR above 1. In the 
previous FIDELIO-DKD study, no heterogeneity in response related to serum potassium was however 
observed and there was no heterogeneity by baseline potassium for the CV endpoints in either study 
which is reassuring. Regarding the demographic characteristics of both trials, patients with the highest 
baseline potassium concentration (4.5 mmol/L) were equally distributed across the different subgroups by 
albuminuria and eGFR levels, contrarily to the expected inverse relationship between potassium and renal 
function. Therefore, the population of patients with potassium >4.5 mmol/L is quite heterogeneous and is 
not directly attributed to those with worse renal function. Given that the heterogeneity could not be 
reproduced in the two studies, that no biological rationale has been identified and that there was no

heterogeneity related to potassium for the CV endpoint in either of the studies, the issue is not further 
pursued.

Explorative endpoints
A new diagnosis of heart failure, which was independently adjudicated by the cardiology CEC, occurred 
less frequently in the finerenone arm than in the placebo arm (Odds ratio 0.675, 95% CI 0.490;0.929, 
Wald test p=0.0160).
No treatment difference could be observed for a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, which 
was also independently adjudicated by the cardiology CEC (FAS: 3.9% in each treatment arm, Odds ratio 
1.000, 95% CI 0.779;1.284, Wald test p=0.9995.
Regression of albuminuria from very high to high albuminuria and high albuminuria to normal albuminuria 
(accompanied by a UACR change of at least 30% from baseline) was seen in more subjects in the 
finerenone arm (47.8%) than in the placebo arm (31.0%) (Odds ratio 2.051, 95% CI 1.861;2.260, Wald 
test p<0.0001).

Least square means from a mixed model analysis for the ratio to baseline of UACR, which include 
measurements from all subjects whether on or off study drug, show that the finerenone treatment effect 
on UACR that was apparent at Month 4 (Section 2.1.4.3.4) was sustained over the duration of the study 
(Figure 36).

The explorative endpoint new diagnosis of heart failure occurred less frequently in the finerenone group 
(HR=0.675 [95% CI 0.490; 0.929]; nominal p=0.016). Similar frequencies were found in both treatment 
groups for the explorative endpoint new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter while in the previous 
FIDELIO-DKD study, a numerical difference was found in favour of finerenone. Regression of albuminuria 
category (from very high to high albuminuria and high albuminuria to normal albuminuria) was more 
frequent in the finerenone arm than placebo. Also, for albuminuria, an explorative analysis showed that 
the UACR reduction by finerenone treatment, that was apparent at Month 4, was sustained over the 
duration of the study.

Design
Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, 
event-driven Phase 3 study.
This was a study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of finerenone compared to 
placebo (1:1 ratio) in addition to standard of care therapy, in patients with 
Type 2 diabetes and a clinical diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease. The starting 
dose of finerenone was based on the eGFR value at the screening visit: 10 mg 
once daily if eGFR between 25 to <60 mL/min/1.73m² (minimum dose); 20 mg 
once daily if eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73m² (maximum dose). Investigators were 
encouraged to reach the maximum (target) dose of 20 mg without 
compromising safety. Restart after interruptions of >7 days was at the lower 
(10 mg) dose.
Duration of main phase:
Event driven, expected approx. 3.5 to 4 years,

Superiority:
Finerenone is superior to placebo in addition to a guideline-directed medical 
therapy with an ACEI or ARB in delaying the time to first occurrence of

excluded from the analyses because of GCP violations, resulting in a FAS 
population of 7352 subjects (3686 subjects in the finerenone arm and 3666

notification for all but 18 subjects (0.2%, 5 in the finerenone arm, 13 in the 
placebo arm). Thus 3681 subjects (99.9%) in the finerenone arm and 3653 
subjects (99.6%) in the placebo arm completed the study. The primary 
analysis was performed on the FAS based on the endpoint events (i.e. first 
occurrences) from randomization up until the end-of-study visit that were 
positively adjudicated by an independent Clinical Events Committee. A 
hierarchical testing procedure was used for the primary and secondary efficacy 
variables.

Notes
For the comparison of finerenone versus placebo, the reduction in the primary 
CV efficacy endpoint was significantly superior. For the first secondary 40% 
renal composite endpoint a positive trend for the finerenone treatment effect 
was observed, that did not reach statistical significance. The remaining 
secondary endpoints all-cause hospitalization, all-cause mortality, change of 
UACR from baseline to Month 4 and the 57% renal composite endpoint were 
not tested formally, but in an exploratory manner.

For the CV composite endpoint, the benefit of finerenone compared with placebo was shown by 
statistically significant results for FIGARO-DKD (HR 0.87) and FIDELIO-DKD (HR 0.86) that were 
nominally significant in the pooled analysis (HR 0.86) across both Phase 3 studies (Table 30).

In FIGARO-DKD finerenone indicated a favourable treatment effect (HR 0.87), which however did not 
reach statistical significance. Statistical significance was reached in FIDELIO-DKD (HR 0.82) and nominal 
significance was reached in the pooled analysis (HR 0.85) across both Phase 3 studies (Table 32).

comparisons finerenone vs placebo (FAS).
Other secondary efficacy endpoints
For all-cause mortality, a treatment effect in favour of finerenone compared to placebo was observed that 
narrowly missed nominal statistical significance in the pooled analysis (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79;1.00). The 
result seen for all-cause mortality was due to lower incidence rates in the finerenone arm for CV death 
and fatal non-CV/non-renal events in both studies.
For all-cause hospitalization, there was a trend towards a treatment effect in favour of finerenone with a 
HR of 0.96 (95% CI 0.91;1.01) in the pooled analysis. The result seen for all-cause hospitalization was 
due to a treatment effect in favour of finerenone for CV hospitalization, that narrowly missed nominal 
statistical significance in the pooled analysis (HR 0.93, [95% CI 0.86;1.00]). The subcomponent 
hospitalization due to heart failure showed a strong result: Incidence rates in the finerenone arm were 
lower compared with placebo in both studies; the difference resulted in a nominally statistically significant 
result in FIGARO-DKD (HR 0.71, [95% CI 0.56; 0.90]) and the pooled analysis (HR 0.78, [95% CI 0.66; 
0.92]).
Decrease in eGFR
After baseline, the initial decline in eGFR was larger in the finerenone arm compared with placebo (Figure 
38). At Month 4, the between-group difference of LS means (finerenone minus placebo) was -2.24 and -
2.38 mL/min/1.73m2 in FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD, respectively.
Thereafter, the between-group difference decreased progressively and a chronic attenuation in the eGFR 
slope was seen in the finerenone treated subjects compared with placebo; crossing of the curves occurred 
at around Month 36 in FIGARO-DKD, Month 24 in FIDELIO-DKD and Month 32 in the pooled analysis.
In an additional ANCOVA, the annualized chronic eGFR slope from Month 4 to the PD or EOS Visit was 
analysed. The slower decline in eGFR for finerenone vs placebo in both studies supports the results 
obtained for the renal composite endpoints, indicating a delay in the progression of CKD with finerenone 
treatment as a long term effect. For the pooled analysis, the preservation of the chronic eGFR slope 
decline as judged by a positive value for chronic slope differences was:
• -2.495 vs -3.702 mL/min/1.73m2 (finerenone vs placebo), resulting in a LS means difference for 
finerenone minus placebo of 1.207 mL/min/1.73m2 (annualized) (p-value of F-test <0.0001)

Subgroup analyses
For the CV composite endpoint, the point estimates of the HRs in the various subgroups were generally 
consistent with the overall result of the pooled analysis for the CV composite endpoint, with the majority 
having HRs <1. No treatment interaction p-values <0.05 were observed. Forest plot of the cardiovascular 
endpoint for GFR categories for the pooled analysis is provided in Figure 43 whereas a forest plot for the 
subgroup ‘region’ for the pooled analysis is provided in Figure 44.
For the secondary 40% and 57% renal composite endpoints, some significant treatment interactions were 
indicated for either one or both renal composite endpoints. However, according to the applicant, there 
was no evidence in any subgroup for qualitative interaction with negative treatment effects, as indicated 
by the Gail-Simon test. Subgroup data for the 40% renal endpoint is summarized in Table 33. Forest plot 
on GFR subgroups of the ≥40% and ≥57% renal endpoints for the pooled FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD 
studies are shown in Figure 43.

Table 33. Data for subgroups for the 40% renal endpoint with p-values for interaction <0.05 (FAS, pooled 
analysis)
Region and race: For the 40% renal composite endpoint, the lowest HRs were observed for subjects in 
Asia or Asian subjects, respectively (Table 33). HRs were 0.68 (Asia), 0.87 (Western Europe), 0.88 (North 
America), 0.93 (Eastern Europe), 1.04 (other regions) and 1.05 (Latin America). Subgroup analysis of the 
57% renal composite endpoint also showed the lowest HRs for subjects in Asia or Asian subjects, 
respectively, but did not demonstrate significant treatment interaction by region or race.
Analyses by level of UACR: For the 40% renal composite endpoint, higher HRs were seen in subjects 
with ‘high’ albuminuria compared to those with ‘very high’ albuminuria (Table 33). Subgroup analysis of 
the 57% renal composite endpoint showed a similar trend, but did not demonstrate significant treatment 
interactions.
The stratified Cox proportional hazards model was fitted with covariates treatment, a cubic B-spline of 
baseline log(UACR) and its interaction with treatment. The fitted curves for HR by continuous baseline 
UACR indicate HRs <1.0 for UACR values above approximately 150 mg/g (Figure 39). Note that the 
confidence intervals widen for UACR <500 mg/g as the event numbers were low for the lower UACR 
values.
Analyses of eGFR over time showed the acute reduction in eGFR for subjects in all albuminuria subgroup 
categories. A stronger finerenone treatment effect on the total eGFR slope was observed earlier 
(crossover of the curves at Month 24) for subjects in the very high albuminuria subgroup compared to 
those with high albuminuria (no crossover up until Month 48) (Figure 40). A preservation of the chronic 
eGFR slope decline (from Month 4 onwards) was observed for both albuminuria subgroups as judged by 
positive values for chronic slope differences that reached nominal statistical significance in the very high 
albuminuria subgroup at screening or baseline.

Baseline serum potassium: Baseline serum potassium categorization by median FAS value resulted in 
treatment interaction p-values <0.05 in both renal endpoints, with lower HRs for the lower serum 
potassium category (Table 33). The stratified Cox proportional hazards model was fitted with covariates 
treatment, a cubic B-spline of baseline serum potassium and its interaction with treatment. The fitted 
curves for HR by continuous baseline serum potassium show an increasing trend, but with a favourable 
treatment effect of finerenone with HRs <1.0 across all serum potassium levels. The confidence intervals 
included the respective overall treatment effect of the primary analysis of HR 0.87 and HR of 0.77 for the 
40% and 57% renal composite endpoint, respectively (Figure 41).

Baseline BMI: Subgroup analyses by BMI categories showed a significant treatment interaction for both 
renal endpoints (Table 33). The HRs for BMI <30kg/m2 and ≥30kg/m2 were 0.71 and 0.99, respectively, 
for the 40% renal composite endpoint and 0.63 and 0.93, respectively, for the 57% renal composite 
endpoint. HRs for BMI categories <20, 20 to <25, 25 to <30, 30 to <35, ≥35 kg/m2) indicated a zig-zag 
pattern for the 40% renal composite endpoint and a U-shaped pattern for the 57% composite endpoint. 
The stratified Cox proportional hazards model was fitted with covariates treatment, a cubic B-spline of 
baseline BMI and its interaction with treatment. The results support the impression of a sigmoidal shape 
(Figure 42). Only for the 40% renal composite endpoint HRs >1.0 are seen with baseline BMIs >34 
kg/m2. For the 57% renal composite endpoint a consistently positive treatment effect of finerenone is 
seen by HRs <1.0 across all BMI values. The confidence intervals for higher BMI values included unity for 
both renal composite endpoints; for the 57% renal composite endpoint also the overall treatment effect 
of an HR of 0.77 of the primary analysis was included.

Baseline weight: Subgroup analysis by baseline weight resulted in a significant treatment interaction 
only for the 57% composite endpoint, most likely due to the small subject number in the weight group 
<50 kg. HRs were 1.96, 0.65 and 0.92 for <50, 50-<90 and ≥90 kg body weight; respective HRs for the 
40% renal composite endpoint were 1.13, 0.77 and 0.97 and did not demonstrate significant treatment 
interaction.

DKD & FIDELIO-DKD. (Modified by Assessor)
The applicant has provided an explorative analysis on pooled data from the FIDELIO-DKD and the 
FIGARO-DKD studies. Baseline characteristics in the two studies are in general similar. However, the 
FIGARO-DKD study submitted with this application enrolled patients with a generally more mild CKD, i.e. 
higher eGFR and lower UACR than in the FIDELIO-DKD study. The pooled dataset contains app. 450 
patients in CKD stage 4, 3500 patients in stage 3, 1950 patients in stage 2 and 650 patients in stage 1, 
per treatment arm, thus, all KDIGO categories are represented by reasonable numbers.
For the CV endpoint, treatment with finerenone resulted in a 14% relative hazard reduction compared 
with placebo (HR 0.86 [95% CI 0.78;0.95]; p=0.0018). In general, the treatment effect appears 
consistent across subgroups. Given that the CV endpoint to a large extent is driven by hospitalization for 
heart failure, possible regional differences are of interest given that treatment practices may vary. 
However, the response across the different region however appears similar which is reassuring. Also, 
given that patients with symptomatic HF were excluded, the study is less susceptible for this type of bias.
For the ≥40% renal composite endpoint, treatment with finerenone resulted in a 15% relative hazard 
reduction compared with placebo (HR 0.85 [95% CI 0.77;0.93]; p=0.0004) which is supported by a 23% 
reduction of the ≥57% renal composite (HR 0.77 [95% CI 0.67; 0.88]; p=0.0002). The pooled analysis 
of the FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD studies encompass patients with a wider GFR range than the 
individual studies. For the KDIGO GFR categories with most participants, i.e. CKD stage 2 and 3, no 
heterogeneity in the response was noted for neither the ≥40% nor the ≥57% renal endpoint. The 
subgroup analysis may indicate a weaker effect of the treatment in CKD stage 4 (HR=0.97 and 1.01 for 
the ≥40% and the ≥57% endpoints, respectively) and a more pronounced effect in stage 1 (HR=0.78 
and 0.44 for the ≥40% and the ≥57% endpoints, respectively). The response in different GFR subgroups 
may however be affected by different levels of albuminuria, due to the inclusion criteria. 
In the FIGARO-DKD study, a more pronounced treatment effect on the ≥40% renal composite was 
observed in subjects with ‘very high’ albuminuria compared to ‘high’ albuminuria, which was also evident 
in the pooled analysis. The fitted curves for HR by continuous baseline UACR indicate HRs <1.0 for UACR 
values above approximately 150 mg/g.
For the chronic eGFR slope, the treatment effect of finerenone on the chronic eGFR slope was reduced in 
patients in the “high” compared to the “very high” subgroup (0.702 [95% CI 0.143;1.261] vs. 1.539 
[95% CI 0.604; 2.475] mL/min/1.73m² per year compared to placebo). A similar pattern was seen in the 
pooled analysis (0.606 [95% CI 0.084 , 1.127] vs. 1.511 [95% CI 1.030 , 1.991] mL/min/1.73m² per 
year compared to placebo).
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023
Page 109/172
The observed reduced treatment effect on the ≥40% renal composite endpoint in patients with higher 
baseline serum potassium observed in the FIGARO-DKD study was also observed in the pooled analysis. 
The influence was however less pronounced and HRs below 1 were observed for all potassium levels.
In the pooled analysis, patients with elevated BMI displayed a reduced treatment effect on the ≥40% 
renal composite, suggesting HRs >1.0 with baseline BMIs >34. The issue has been previously discussed 
based on data from the FIDELIO-DKD study during the initial approval procedure without reaching any 
conclusions.
In addition, the Applicant provided a pooled analysis of CV and renal endpoints by subgroups as stratified 
based on the combined evaluation of eGFR and UACR levels. Analyses by the overlapping populations 
between the studies, i.e. the comparable risk populations, are displayed pooled in Figure 45 and Figure 
47 for the CV and renal endpoints, respectively. Post-hoc analyses for the subgroup eGFR*UACR at 
baseline are shown in Figure 46 and Figure 48 for the CV and renal endpoints, respectively.

While no heterogeneity was observed across categories by eGFR/UCAR levels in terms of CV outcomes, 
the pooled analysis of the renal endpoints revealed a significant difference in response to treatment 
across subgroups depending on level of albuminuria. Within the Stage 3 and 4 KDIGO categories 
(eGFR<60 ml/min/m2), treatment favoured finerenone in patients with “very high” albuminuria but not in 
those with “high” albuminuria. In the assessment of the initial MAA, the effect of different degrees of 
albuminuria could not be fully characterised due to the limited numerosity of the “high” albuminuria group 
of the FIDELIO trial. The implementation of this subcategory with the subpopulation of patients recruited 
in the FIGARO trial offers the possibility for a data revision. The pooled analysis demonstrates that the 
effect of treatment remains beneficial (HR<1) for all eGFR categories in the presence of “very high” levels 
of albuminuria, whilst HR≥0.99 was observed for “high” albuminuria patients, including those with Stage 
3 and 4 CKD (eGFR<60 ml/min/m2). The heterogeneity in the effect was reflected in section 5.1 of the 
SmPC of Kerendia. 
Ancillary analyses
Baseline albuminuria
To address the heterogeneity observed for the secondary 40% renal endpoint in relation to baseline 
albuminuria, the applicant has conducted additional analyses.
Line plots of the eGFR absolute changes from baseline for the “high” and “very high” subgroups are 
provided in Figure 30.
For the chronic eGFR slope, the treatment effect of finerenone on the chronic eGFR slope was reduced in 
patients in the “high” compared to the “very high” subgroup (0.702 [95% CI 0.143;1.261] vs. 1.539 
[95% CI 0.604; 2.475] mL/min/1.73m² per year compared to placebo). This may be expected given that 
also the decline in the placebo group in the “high” albuminuria subgroup was less pronounced than in the 
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023
Page 112/172
“very high” albuminuria subgroup (-1.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 vs. -5.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year), reflecting 
the lower progression rate of renal dysfunction in these patients. The eGFR curves in the “very high” 
group cross at month 24 while no crossing is observed during the study in the “high” albuminuria 
subgroup. 
For the pooled data, a similar picture was observed (chronic slope differences of 0.606 and 1.511 
mL/min/1.73m² per year for high albuminuria and very high albuminuria at baseline, respectively. For the 
secondary endpoint UACR at month 4, a similar reduction was found in both the “high” and “very high” 
subgroups (Figure 50). Additional explorative data shows a sustained reduction in both subgroups up to 
36 months (Figure 51).
An additional net clinical benefit (NCB) outcome was defined. This NCB outcome is restricted to fatal 
events and events with irreversible harm (i.e. efficacy outcomes including all-cause mortality, stroke, MI, 
hospitalization for HF, and kidney failure; safety outcomes including fatal, life-threatening and AEs 
leading to persistent or significant disability / incapacity for hyperkalaemia [defined in the EU RMP version 
2.2 as an important identified risk] and acute renal failure) in the pooled Phase 3 studies FIDELIO-DKD 
and FIGARO-DKD. The NCB outcome can be considered as a composite efficacy and safety endpoint and 
was analysed using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model (Table 34).

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy
The application for variation is based on efficacy data from the FIGARO-DKD study. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies
The FIGARO-DKD Study 17530 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group, 
multicenter, event-driven Phase 3 study in patients with T2D and CKD.
Like the FIDELIO-DKD study, the pivotal study for the initial market authorisation for finerenone, subjects 
with CKD and T2D were enrolled and had to be treated with the individual maximum tolerated labelled 
dose of either an ACEI or an ARB. Eligible patients had persistent high albuminuria (UACR ≥30 to <300 
mg/g) and eGFR 25-90 mL/min or very high albuminuria (UACR ≥300 mg/g) and eGFR ≥60mL/min. 
Thus, patients had in general higher GFR and lower degree of albuminuria than the previous study in 
order to enrich the study for CV rather than renal events, in line with the CHMP advice. 
The study was amended twice globally, and the amendments are in general considered appropriate. 
The starting dose of study drug (10 or 20 mg) depended on the eGFR level at the screening visit and is in 
line with the currently approved SmPC. Up-titration to the target dose of 20 mg was permitted if serum 
potassium was ≤4.8 mmol/L and if eGFR had not decreased below a certain degree. The study drug dose 
could be titrated up or down according to the potassium response and investigators were encouraged to 
reach the maximum dose of 20 mg without compromising safety.
The primary endpoint was the time to the first occurrence of the composite endpoint of CV death or non-
fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure (abbreviated as the CV composite endpoint).
The key secondary endpoint was the time to the first occurrence of the renal composite endpoint of onset 
of kidney failure, a sustained decrease of eGFR ≥40% from baseline over at least 4 weeks, or renal 
death. Other secondary endpoints focused on all-cause hospitalization, all-cause mortality and UACR as 
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023
Page 117/172
well as a secondary renal composite that defined a more pronounced eGFR decrease compared to the 
primary endpoint (≥57% vs. ≥40%).
The endpoints were similar to the FIDELIO-DKD study, but the primary and the key secondary endpoint 
have shifted places.
The statistical analysis as planned could overall be agreed. The FIGARO-DKD study shared a number of 
design and analysis features with the FIDELIO-DKD study. In that respect it is acknowledged that besides 
the different endpoint order, the two studies had slightly differently defined multiple testing procedures 
(MTPs). Both are considered appropriate as are based on a hierarchical testing procedure. The MTP in the 
FIDELIO-DKD study also included a weighted Bonferroni-Holm procedure for the primary and the key 
secondary endpoint. In both studies the remaining secondary endpoints were to be tested only if both the 
primary and most important secondary endpoint achieved formal statistical significance. The first 
secondary endpoint in the FIGARO-DKD study was the primary endpoint in FIDELIO-DKD study and vice 
versa, time to all-cause hospitalization and all-cause mortality had shifted place in the hierarchical order. 
The latest version of the submitted SAP was version 6.0, dated 15 Feb 2021. The FIGARO-DKD study was 
completed on 02 Feb 2021 and database release occurred 19 April 2021. The changes made to the SAP 
has thoroughly been accounted for. Some were major, however none that raise any serious concern, and 
none that appears to have been inspired by the analysis of the FIDELIO-DKD study that was completed in 
April 2020. 
Supportive analyses to account for the COVID-19 pandemic for primary and secondary time-to-event 
efficacy endpoints were planned (amendment to the SAP) and have been presented considering four 
different versions for the COVID-19 onset date (country-specific, global, individual pandemic related 
disruption date, individual COVID-19 AE date). Based on the analyses performed on the primary 
endpoint, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic appears to have been limited.
In addition, a number of post-hoc analyses have been performed for further assessments after that 
subgroup analyses revealed treatment interactions (p<0.05) concerning baseline factors correlating with 
stage of kidney disease. In that respect, they are appreciated. The post-hoc analyses were briefly 
described in a separate SAP (version 1.0, 28 May 2021). Although the value of pre-definition is inherently 
less when it comes to analyses that by nature are data-driven, the SAP lacked details. Regarding 
continuous modelling of baseline UACR and potassium for renal composite endpoints there were no 
details, and the applicant was requested to clarify how and why a cubic B-spline was decided to best fit 
the data. Recognising the exploratory objective, the brief description presented by the applicant is 
accepted although does not add the details that were thought to be missing in the provided SAP. It is 
supported that candidates for knots were not only data-driven but also based on medical judgement while 
the selection of a cubic B-spline function was considered as a compromise between smoothness of the 
curves and overfitting the data. Furthermore, during the procedure, additional exploratory analyses were 
submitted further characterizing the response in relation to baseline albuminuria.
With respect to the presented pooled analysis of data from both the FIGARO- and the FIDELIO-DKD 
study, the applicant confirmed that the SAP for the pooled analysis was part of report PH-42134. This SAP 
was dated 24 FEB 2021 (version 3.0).   
Efficacy data and additional analyses
The FIGARO-DKD study encompassed 3723 patients randomized to finerenone and 3714 patients 
randomized to placebo. The percentage of randomized subjects that completed the study was high 
(98.9% finerenone; 98.4% placebo). Over 80% of the participants took the medication for over 24 
months.

Baseline characteristics were similar in the two treatment arms and were comparable to the previous 
FIDELIO-DKD study, except that eGFR was higher and UACR lower in the present study due to different 
inclusion criteria. Also, the occurrence of diabetic retinopathy was less frequent in the present study 
compared to the FIDELIO-DKD (app. 30% compared to 45%). Almost all patients had hypertension.   
Approximately 40% of patients had hyperlipidaemia, 30% coronary artery disease and 30% diabetic 
neuropathy. Mean values of HbA1c were app. 7.7% in both groups.
The primary endpoint intended to support the proposed amendment to the indication “prevention of 
cardiovascular (CV) events in adults with CKD”. Treatment with finerenone resulted in a 13% relative risk 
reduction compared with placebo for the CV composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal myocardial 
infarction, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure (HR 0.87 [95% CI 0.76; 0.98]; p=0.0264). 
The primary endpoint of the study was thus met. The relative risk reduction was of a similar magnitude 
as observed in the previous FIDELIO-DKD study where this CV composite was defined as the key 
secondary endpoint (HR 0.86 [95% CI 0.747; 0.989]).
The Kaplan-Meier curves did separate starting 6 months after treatment initiation, which indicates a 
sustained effect. The absolute risk reduction based on Kaplan-Meier cumulative incidences for the primary 
CV endpoint was 2.0% at Month 36 and 2.1% at Month 42, corresponding to NNTs to prevent one 
primary endpoint event of 51 and 47 subjects, respectively.
The effect is driven by hospitalizations due to heart failure (HR 0.71 [95% CI 0.56; 0.90]; p=0.0043). 
The components non-fatal stroke and non-fatal MI were unchanged by the treatment whereas CV death 
was numerically slightly lower in the finerenone compared to the placebo arm (194/3686 vs. 214/3666 
cases; HR 0.90 [95% CI 0.74; 1.09]; p=ns).
Of note, the rate of CV events was similar between the two study populations (12.4% vs 14.2% and 13% 
vs 14.8% in the FIGARO and FIDELIO, respectively), with a prevailing incidence of hospitalization for 
heart failure among the individual components of the composite endpoint. The two populations can be 
therefore regarded as homogenous and complementary in terms of CV risk. This is supported by the 
categorization of risk of disease progression as estimated on the basis of the combined eGFR/UACR 
analysis (KDIGO 2012 guidelines), which indicates that recruitment in both the FIDELIO and FIGARO 
mainly included the “high” and “very high” risk categories however with some representation of patients 
with “moderate” risk. 
The treatment effect on the primary endpoint was generally consistent in subgroups with no statistically 
significant interactions for the stratification factors or other key subgroups. The treatment effect in 
Europe appears less pronounced (HR=0.95) than in the other regions. However, in the previous FIDELIO-
DKD study and in the pooled analysis of the FIGARO-DKD and the FIDELIO-DKD studies, the effect was 
comparable to the effect in other regions. Uniform results across regions are important given that the CV 
endpoint was driven by CV hospitalization that may be sensitive to regional practice.
Finerenone had no effect on all-cause hospitalisation (HR = 0.97 [95% CI 0.90;1.04]; log rank test 
nominal p=0.3558) but had an effect on the component hospitalization due to heart failure, as previously 
discussed.
For all-cause mortality, finerenone treatment resulted in a 11% relative risk reduction compared to 
placebo (HR = 0.89 [95% CI 0.77;1.04]; log rank test nominal p=0.1337). The difference was not 
significant but indicates no general detrimental effect of the treatment, in line with previous findings from 
the FIDELIO-DKD study.
The study excluded symptomatic patients with heart failure (NYHA II-IV) with reduced ejection fraction, 
thus an HF hospitalisation can be regarded as the first manifestation of a more significant HF. In line with 
this, the exploratory endpoint new diagnosis of heart failure occurred less frequently in the finerenone 
group (HR=0.675 [95% CI 0.490; 0.929]; nominal p=0.016).

The key secondary endpoint intends to support a broadening of the indication to encompass all stages of 
CKD (with albuminuria) associated with type 2 diabetes (i.e. deletion of “stage 3 and 4” from the 
currently approved indication). Treatment with finerenone resulted in a 13% relative hazard reduction 
compared with placebo of the first secondary endpoint time to the first occurrence of onset of kidney 
failure, a sustained decrease of eGFR ≥40% from baseline over at least 4 weeks, or renal death (HR 0.87 
[95% CI 0.76; 1.01] p=0.0689]) but the result did not reach statistical significance. In the previous 
FIDELIO-DKD study, this composite was defined as the primary endpoint and turned out significant with a 
slightly lower point estimate (HR = 0.825 [95% CI 0.732; 0.928]).
The Kaplan-Meier curves did separate after 24 months and indicate a sustained effect after this timepoint. 
In the previous FIGARO-DKD study, a sustained effect was also noted, but with an earlier curve 
separation at 12 months. When analysing the components of the composite, directionally consistent 
changes in kidney failure and sustained decrease in eGFR ≥40% (relative to baseline) were observed. For 
renal death, too few cases occurred (2 in the placebo group) to draw any conclusions.
Given that the secondary 40% renal composite endpoint did not meet the pre-planned criterion for 
significance, the remaining secondary endpoints were not tested formally, but in an exploratory manner.
The secondary 57% renal composite defined a more pronounced eGFR decrease that corresponds to a 
doubling of serum creatinine, compared to the primary endpoint that involved a ≥40% reduction. 
Treatment with finerenone resulted in a 23% relative hazard reduction compared with placebo (HR 0.77 
[95% CI 0.60;0.99]; log rank test nominal p=0.0406) i.e. a similar risk reduction as seen in the previous 
FIDELIO-DKD study, providing support for renoprotection.
In line with the treatment effect observed in the previous FIDELIO-DKD study, UACR from baseline to 
month 4 was reduced in the finerenone group compared to placebo (HR=0.676 [95% CI 0.650; 0.704]; 
nominal p-value of F-test <0.0001) which supports the renoprotective mode of action. In addition, the 
explorative endpoint “regression of albuminuria from very high to high albuminuria and high albuminuria 
to normal albuminuria (accompanied by a UACR change of at least 30% from baseline)” was seen in more 
subjects in the finerenone arm (47.8%) than in the placebo arm (31.0%) (Odds ratio 2.051, [95% CI 
1.861;2.260], Wald test nominal p<0.0001).
The responses in the 40% and 57% renal endpoints were heterogenous in subgroups of albuminuria, GFR 
and serum potassium.
Due to the inclusion criteria, there was a distinct relationship between albuminuria and eGFR at 
screening: the subgroup of ‘high’ albuminuria corresponded to subjects with lower range of eGFR of ≥25 
to ≤90 mL/min/1.73 m2 whereas the subgroup of ‘very high’ albuminuria corresponded to subjects with 
higher eGFR of ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2. 
For the 40% renal endpoint, the treatment effect was reduced in subjects with ‘high’ albuminuria 
compared to ‘very high’ albuminuria; the HRs were 1.16 [95% CI 0.91; 1.47] compared to 0.74 [95% CI 
0.62; 0.90]. For the 57% endpoint, the same pattern was seen but the estimate in the “high” subgroup is 
uncertain given the generally lower incidence in the placebo group compared to the incidence for the 40% 
endpoint (5.02 vs. 2.3 n/100 p-yrs). In the previous FIDELIO-DKD study, few participants with ’high’ 
albuminuria were enrolled, thus no reliable estimate of the effect in this population is available previously. 
A further post-hoc analysis using modelling indicates HRs >1 for the 40% renal endpoint for subjects with 
baseline UACR values below app. 400 mg/g. For the chronic eGFR slope, the treatment effect of 
finerenone on the chronic eGFR slope was reduced in patients in the “high” compared to the “very high” 
subgroup (0.702 [95% CI 0.143;1.261] vs. 1.539 [95% CI 0.604; 2.475] mL/min/1.73m² per year 
compared to placebo). This may be expected given that also the decline in the placebo group in the 
“high” albuminuria subgroup was less pronounced than in the “very high” albuminuria subgroup (-1.8 
mL/min/1.73 m2 vs. -5.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year), reflecting the lower progression rate of renal 
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023
Page 120/172
dysfunction in these patients. Nevertheless, both subgroups demonstrate a positive difference compared 
to the corresponding placebo groups. The eGFR curves in the “very high” group cross at month 24 while 
no crossing is observed during the study in the “high” albuminuria subgroup. For the secondary endpoint 
UACR at month 4, a similar reduction was found in both the “high” and “very high” subgroups. Additional 
explorative data provided in the response shows a sustained reduction in both subgroups up to 36 
months.  
Heterogeneity was also found for subgroups of GFR for the 40% and 57% renal endpoints. Given the 
inclusion criteria, most patients were in the ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2 group of screening eGFR i.e. the 
population for the proposed indication broadening. A positive treatment effect was shown in this group as 
well as the 25-40 mL/min/1.73m2 group. However, finerenone treated patients in the 45-60 
mL/min/1.73m2 group displayed an increased HR (1.62 [95% CI 1.12; 2.34]) for both the 40% and the 
57% endpoints compared to the other GFR categories. Given that most patients in this GFR subgroup had 
‘high’ albuminuria, the increased HR may be related to the degree of albuminuria rather than GFR. This is 
supported by data from the FIDELIO-DKD trial (where few participants were in category ‘high’) that 
showed no heterogeneity with regards to GFR. In summary, a positive treatment effect was found in 
eGFR subgroups in the range relevant for the proposed broadening of the indication whereas some 
subgroups, already covered by the present indication, displayed HR:s >1 which may be related to an 
interaction with the degree of albuminuria. 
For serum potassium, patients with higher levels appears to have a reduced treatment effect. For the 
40% endpoint, the HR in patients with potassium >4.3 mM was 1.06 [95% CI 0.85; 1.32] compared to 
0.75 [95% CI 0.62; 0.91] for patients ≤4.3 mM. The heterogeneity was still present when data was 
stratified by a higher cut-off of 4.5 mM (HR 0.77 vs. 1.24).  A further post-hoc analysis using modelling 
indicates a better treatment effect (i.e. lower HRs) in patients with a lower baseline potassium. Patients 
with serum potassium above 4.8 mM displayed a HR above 1. In the previous FIDELIO-DKD study, no 
heterogeneity in response related to serum potassium was however found. Patients with the highest 
potassium concentration at baseline (4.5 mmol/L) were equally distributed across the different subgroups 
by albuminuria and eGFR levels, contrarily to the expected inverse relationship between potassium and 
renal function. Therefore, the population of patients with potassium >4.5 mmol/L is quite heterogeneous 
and is not directly attributed to those with worse renal function. Given that the heterogeneity could not 
be reproduced in the two studies, that no biological rationale has been identified and that there was no 
heterogeneity related to potassium for the CV endpoint in either of the studies, the issue is not further 
pursued.
Efficacy data from the pooled analysis
The applicant has provided an explorative analysis on pooled data from the FIDELIO-DKD and the 
FIGARO-DKD studies. For the CV endpoint, treatment with finerenone resulted in a 14% relative hazard 
reduction compared with placebo (HR 0.86 [95% CI 0.78;0.95]; p=0.0018), driven by a reduction in 
hospitalizations for heart failure. The Kaplan-Meier curves start to diverge at month 6, supporting a 
sustained effect, in line with data from the individual FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD studies. In general, 
the response appears consistent across subgroups, including regions.
In the pooled analysis, treatment with finerenone resulted in a 15% relative hazard reduction of the 
≥40% renal composite endpoint compared with placebo (HR 0.85 [95% CI 0.77;0.93]; p=0.0004) which 
is supported by a 23% reduction of the ≥57% renal composite (HR 0.77 [95% CI 0.67; 0.88]; 
p=0.0002). The pooled analysis encompasses app. 450 patients in CKD stage 4, 3500 patients in stage 3, 
1950 patients in stage 2 and 650 patients in stage 1 per treatment arm, thus, all KDIGO categories are 
represented by reasonable numbers. For the KDIGO GFR categories with most participants, i.e. CKD stage 
2 and 3, the point estimates were in line with the overall HR for the ≥40% and the ≥57% renal 
endpoints. The subgroup analysis indicates a weaker effect of the treatment in CKD stage 4 (HR=0.97 
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023
Page 121/172
and 1.01 for the ≥40% and the ≥57% endpoints, respectively) and a more pronounced effect in stage 1 
(HR=0.78 and 0.44 for the ≥40% and the ≥57% endpoints, respectively). In conclusion, the pooled 
analysis is in general in support for an effect across the different KDIGO categories, including CKD stage 1 
and 2 for which extension of indication is sought, however, heterogeneity in relation to baseline 
albuminuria was observed in line with the main analysis of the FIGARO-DKD study. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy
The application for variation is based on efficacy data from the FIGARO-DKD study encompassing 7334 
patients with CKD and T2D treated with the individual maximum tolerated labelled dose of either an ACEI 
or an ARB. Treatment with finerenone resulted in a 13% relative risk reduction compared with placebo for 
the composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization 
for heart failure. Thus, a statistically significant effect has been shown in line with data from the previous 
FIDELIO-DKD study. The effect as documented by the primary endpoint was driven by hospitalizations for 
heart failure while there was no effect on nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke. The applicant 
proposed a reference to section 5.1 with respect to “cardiovascular protection” but has agreed to change 
the reference to “renal and CV events” in order to align the SmPC with other recently approved products.
The key secondary renal endpoint in the FIGARO-DKD study intends to support a broadening of the 
indication to encompass all stages of CKD (with albuminuria) associated with type 2 diabetes (i.e. 
deletion of “stage 3 and 4” from the currently approved indication). Treatment with finerenone resulted in 
a 13% relative hazard reduction compared with placebo of the first secondary endpoint time to the first 
occurrence of onset of kidney failure, a sustained decrease of eGFR ≥40% from baseline over at least 4 
weeks, or renal death. The endpoint was not significant, however, in line with the CHMP’s opinion given in 
the SA, lack of statistical significance in the FIGARO results is not considered a main limiting factor to the 
pursued extension of indication, considering that a positive trend favouring finerenone over placebo has 
been demonstrated in the study population including Stage 1 and 2. Data is thus in general in support for 
an effect across the different KDIGO categories, including CKD stage 1 and 2 for which extension of 
indication is sought. For the key secondary renal endpoint, the treatment effect was reduced in subjects 
with ‘high’ albuminuria (HR=1.16 [95% CI 0.91; 1.47]) compared to ‘very high’ albuminuria (HR=0.74 
[95% CI 0.62; 0.90]).  Data on UACR however suggest a similar and sustained response in both 
subgroups. Also, for the exploratory analysis of the chronic eGFR slope there was a positive effect on the 
slope in both subgroups compared to placebo, but the magnitude was reduced in patients in the “high” 
compared to the “very high” subgroup which may be expected given the lower progression rate of renal 
dysfunction in these patients. Thus, data suggest no treatment effect on renal clinical endpoints during 
the follow up time but the effect on GFR slope and UACR indicate a future beneficial effect not yet seen in 
clinical endpoints. Finerenone had a beneficial effect on the primary CV endpoint in the FIGARO-DKD 
study, regardless of baseline albuminuria status. Thus, the totality of data, including findings from post 
hoc analyses, support that patients with both “high” and “very high” albuminuria benefit from the 
treatment.
2.5.  Clinical safety
Introduction
Kerendia is indicated for the treatment of CKD (stage 3 and 4 with albuminuria) associated with type 2 
diabetes in adults. The main evidence of efficacy submitted to support the indication was the FIDELIO-
DKD study in T2DM patients with CKD (mean eGFR 44 mL/min/1.73 m2) and albuminuria (mean UACR 
806 mg/g). The major safety concern in the FIDELIO-DKD study was hyperkalaemia that increased with 
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023
Page 122/172
decreasing renal function. SAEs of hyperkalaemia were reported more frequently for finerenone than for 
placebo and a higher incidence of hyperkalaemia leading to discontinuation and to hospitalisation was 
reported for finerenone compared with placebo. The risk for serious events of hyperkalaemia for Kerendia 
is handled with routine risk minimisation.
The FIGARO-DKD study included T2DM patients with CKD (mean eGFR 68 mL/min/1.73 m2) and 
albuminuria (mean UACR 287 mg/g). The safety results of FIGARO-DKD are presented individually 
followed by a summary of the pooled analysis of FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD.
When comparing extent of exposure between FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD, the differences in patient 
population enrolled as well as the approximately 1 year longer observation time of FIGARO-DKD 
compared with FIDELIO-DKD should be considered. These differences led to the observed higher total 
exposure in FIGARO-DKD, and the generally better-preserved kidney function led to a lower frequency of 
study drug dose interruptions and a higher proportion of subjects on the higher dose compared with 
FIDELIO-DKD.
Patient exposure
Extent of exposure in FIGARO-DKD
In the FIGARO-DKD study, 3,683 subjects were treated with finerenone for a total exposure of 10,802 
patient-years, with 3,321 subjects (90%) for at least 52 weeks, 2,990 subjects (81%) for at least 2 
years, 1,832 (50%) for at least 3 years and 824 subjects (22%) for at least 4 years. The mean duration 
of exposure was 35.2 and 35.4 months in the finerenone and placebo arms, respectively.
In FIDELIO-DKD study, 2,827 subjects were treated with finerenone for a total exposure of 6,346 patient-
years, with 2,446 subjects (87%) for at least 52 weeks, 1,631 subjects (58%) for at least 2 years, 724 
(25%) for at least 3 years and 51 subjects (1.8%) for at least 4 years. The mean duration of exposure 
was 26.9 and 27.6 months in the finerenone and placebo arms, respectively.

EMA/41550/2023

Table 35 Duration of treatment with study (SAF)
The overall exposure for FIGARO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD was 17,149 PY for finerenone and 17,221 PY for 
placebo. The cumulative exposure was lower in FIDELIO-DKD compared with FIGARO-DKD, due to the 
overall shorter observation time in FIDELIO-DKD. The patient population enrolled in FIGARO-DKD had a 
less advanced CKD and a lower risk of progression to renal outcomes compared with the FIDELIO-DKD 
study population. About 30% more patients were treated in the FIGARO-DKD (n=7,341) than in FIDELIO-
DKD (n=5,658). The follow-up time in FIGARO-DKD was approximately 1 year longer compared with 
FIDELIO-DKD.
Demographic and other characteristics of study population FIGARO-DKD
In the FIGARO-DKD study, most subjects in the SAF had a baseline eGFR of ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2 (62.0% 
finerenone, 61.5% placebo). The mean eGFR value at baseline was 67.83 mL/min/1.73m2.
The median UACR at baseline in the SAF was 308.74 mg/g. Similar numbers of subjects were categorized 
as having high albuminuria (30 mg/g to <300 mg/g: 46.4%) and very high albuminuria at baseline 
(≥300 mg/g: 50.8%). 
The mean serum potassium value at baseline in the SAF was 4.33 mmol/L and 28.5% of subjects had 
serum potassium values of >4.5 mmol/L, 5.8% had >4.8 to ≤5.0 mmol/L, and 4.6% had >5.0 mmol/L at 
baseline.

In the FIGARO-DKD study, most subjects had a baseline eGFR of ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2 with albuminuria 
(mean eGFR 68 mL/min/1.73m2, mean UACR 287 mg/g in the SAF). In the FIDELIO-DKD study, subjects 
had a lower eGFR and more than two times higher mean baseline UACR (mean eGFR 44 mL/min/1.73m2, 
mean UACR 806 mg/g in the SAF). 
The safety population in FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD had a mean age of 65 years, about 15% were 
≥75 years of age and 0.8% were ≥85 years of age. Serum potassium values of >4.5 mmol/L at baseline 
was noted in 28% and 34% of the subjects in FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD, respectively. 
Overall, the safety database is considered to be representative of a broad general population of adults 
with T2DM and includes a sufficient number of subjects with long duration of disease, in both the 
FIGARO-DKD and the FIDELIO-DKD studies.  
Disposition of patients
A total of 3,646 subjects were discontinued from study drug: 1,831 subjects (28.1%) in the finerenone 
arm and 1,815 subjects (27.9%) in the placebo arm. The most frequently reported primary reasons for 
not completing the treatment were: adverse event (9.0% in the finerenone arm, 8.7% in the placebo 
arm), withdrawal by subject (6.2% in the finerenone arm, 5.9% in the placebo arm), death (5.3% in the 
finerenone arm, 6.3% in the placebo arm) and physician decision (4.6% in the finerenone arm, 3.7% in 
the placebo arm). More subjects in FIDELIO-DKD (approximately 10% in both treatment arms) did not 
complete treatment due to adverse or outcome event compared with FIGARO-DKD (approximately 7% in 
both treatment arms (Table 37).

Table 37 Disposition: End of treatment (full analysis set) - FIGARO-DKD & FIDELIO-DKD
In the FIGARO-DKD, about 28% of the subjects discontinued from study drug (balanced between 
finerenone and placebo). The most common reason for discontinuation from study drug was 
discontinuation due to adverse events (7.5% and 7.4% for finerenone and placebo), withdrawal by 
subject (6.6% and 5.9% for finerenone and placebo) and death (5.8% and 6.8% for finerenone and 
placebo). More subjects in FIDELIO-DKD (approximately 11% in both treatment arms) did not complete 
treatment due to adverse or outcome event compared with FIGARO-DKD (approximately 7% in both 
treatment arms).
Adverse events
Study FIGARO-DKD
The proportion of subjects with TEAEs was similar across treatment arms, with 85.1% reporting a TEAE in 
the finerenone arm compared with 85.5% in the placebo arm. In most subjects, TEAEs were reported as 
mild or moderate in maximum intensity. 
In most subjects in FIGARO-DKD, TEAEs were assessed as being either mild (29.1% and 29.2% for 
finerenone and placebo) or moderate in maximum intensity (38.6% and 37.1% for finerenone and 
placebo). A total of 639 subjects (17.3%) in the finerenone arm and 705 subjects (19.3%) in the placebo 
arm had at least 1 TEAE assessed as severe in maximum intensity.
The overall percentage of subjects with TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug was 
5.6% in the finerenone arm and 5.0% in the placebo arm (Table 38). 
Integrated data from study FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD
In terms of proportions of subjects with TEAEs, the treatment arms were balanced in both studies, with 
approximately 86% of subjects in each treatment arm in the pooled analysis (85% in FIGARO-DKD, 87% 
in FIDELIO-DKD).
In most of subjects in the pooled analysis (FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD), TEAEs were assessed as 
being either mild (29.1% and 28.2% for finerenone and placebo) or moderate in maximum intensity 
(39.4%) and (38.8% for finerenone and placebo). A total of 1140 subjects (17.5%) in the finerenone arm 
and 1261 subjects (19.4%) in the placebo arm had at least 1 TEAE assessed as severe in maximum 
intensity.

The overall number of subjects with TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug was 6.4% 
in the finerenone arm and 5.4% in the placebo arm, with slightly higher numbers seen in FIDELIO-DKD 
compared with FIGARO-DKD. This difference is mostly driven by the higher incidence of hyperkalaemia 
TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation in the finerenone arm in both studies.
Table 38 Overall summary of number of subjects with TEAEs (safety analysis set) - FIGARO-
DKD & FIDELIO-DKD
The incidence of TEAEs was similar for finerenone and placebo, respectively, in the FIGARO-DKD 
study (85.1% vs 85.5%) and in the pooled analysis with data from the FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-
DKD studies (86.1% vs 86.4%). The incidence of drug-related TEAEs was higher for finerenone 
compared with placebo, respectively, in the FIAGARO-DKD study (15.2% vs 11.3%) and in the 
pooled analysis (18.5% vs 13.3%) and was mostly driven by study drug-related hyperkalaemia. 
TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug was slightly higher in the finerenone 
group compared with the placebo group in the FIGARO-DKD study (5.6% vs 5.0%) and in the 
pooled analysis of the FIGARO and FIDELIO studies (6.4% vs 5.4%). See also below in 
Discontinuation due to adverse events.
In the FIGARO-DKD study, most of the TEAEs (about 67%) were mild or moderate in intensity and 
18% were severe in intensity; balanced between the finerenone and placebo groups. The intensity of 
AEs was described in almost all of the cases. The distribution of mild, moderate and severe AEs, 
respectively, were the same in the pooled analysis.
Common adverse events 
Study FIGARO-DKD
The more frequently reported common TEAEs in the finerenone arm in FIGARO-DKD were the MedDRA 
PTs hyperkalemia (9.1% finerenone vs 4.4% placebo), arthralgia (8.1% vs 7.2%), upper respiratory tract 
infection (6.1% vs 5.6%) and dizziness (5.3% finerenone vs 4.6% placebo), Table 39. Among TEAEs 
reported with a frequency of ≥1% difference between the treatment arms, those with a higher frequency 
in the finerenone arm were hyperkalemia (9.1% vs 4.4%), hyperuricaemia (4.5% vs 2.8%) and 
hypotension (4.2% vs 2.5%) (Table 40).
Pooled analysis of data from studies FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD
The most frequently reported TEAEs in the pooled analysis from studies FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD 
in Table 39. Hyperkalemia (12.0% of subjects in the finerenone arm vs 5.9% of subjects in the placebo 
arm) and decreased GFR (5.3% in the finerenone arm vs 4.2% in the placebo arm) were the only 2 
commonly reported TEAEs (≥5% of subjects on finerenone) that were reported more frequently in the

Treatment-emergent adverse events related to study drug 
In FIGARO-DKD, 560 subjects (15.2%) in the finerenone arm had study drug related TEAEs compared 
with 413 subjects (11.3%) in the placebo arm. The most frequently reported study drug related TEAEs in 
the finerenone arm were hyperkalemia (5.7% vs 2.7% for finerenone vs placebo).
In the pooled analysis, the number of subjects with study drug related TEAEs was higher in the 
finerenone arm (18.5%) than in the placebo arm (13.3%). The difference is mostly driven by the higher 
number of subjects observed with study drug-related hyperkalemia TEAEs in the finerenone arm in both 
studies.
COVID-19: adverse event analysis (FIGARO-DKD)
The percentage of subjects with COVID-19 AEs during the study was generally low and lower in the 
finerenone arm (84 subjects, 2.3%) than in the placebo arm (116 subjects, 3.2%). 
The current section 4.8 of the SmPC for Kerendia includes “hyperkalaemia” (very common), 
“hyponatremia” (common), “hypotension” (common), “pruritus” (common), “GFR decreased” (common) 
and “haemoglobin decreased” (uncommon). Moreover, “hyperuricaemia” has been proposed to be 
included in section 4.8 with the frequency “common”, based on data from the FIGARO study (4.5% vs 
2.8%) for finerenone vs placebo and from the pooled analysis with data from the FIGARO-DKD and 
FIDELIO-DKD studies (4.5% vs 3.4%). This is endorsed.
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events
Deaths
In FIGARO-DKD, 339 subjects in the finerenone arm and 383 subjects in the placebo arm died in the FAS. 
In addition to the subjects in the SAF, 2 subjects, who never took study drug, died of CV death of an 
undetermined cause. Overall, the number of fatal outcome or adverse events in the SAF was lower in the 
finerenone arm (338 subjects, 9.2%) than in the placebo arm (382 subjects, 10.4%) Table 42.
In the pooled analysis, the number of fatal outcome or adverse events in the SAF was lower in the 
finerenone arm (557 subjects, 8.6%) than in the placebo arm (631 subjects, 9.7%) (Table 42).
Table 42 Overview of death (SAF)
AE = adverse event, OE = outcome event
In the FIGARO study, adjudicated reasons for deaths for subjects in the SAF were well comparable to the 
results presented for the FAS (Table 43). Fewer sudden cardiac deaths (53 subjects in the finerenone 
arm vs 73 subjects in the placebo arm), deaths due to heart failure (9 subjects in the finerenone arm vs 
14 subjects in the placebo arm), and fatal stroke (12 subjects in the finerenone arm vs 19 subjects in the 
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023
Page 130/172
placebo arm) mainly contributed to the lower number of CV deaths in the finerenone arm. No renal 
deaths were reported in the finerenone arm and the percentage of subjects with non-CV or non-renal 
causes of death was lower in the finerenone arm (139 subjects, 3.8%) than in the placebo arm (154 
subjects, 4.2%).
In the FIGARO study, 179 subjects (4.9%) in the finerenone arm and 218 subjects (6.0%) in the placebo 
arm died due to treatment-emergent adverse or outcome event. The most frequently reported treatment-
emergent fatal adverse or outcome event was the PT death (not otherwise specified) in both treatment 
arms (finerenone: 31 subjects, 0.8%; placebo: 22 subjects, 0.6%). Cardiac disorders as well as general 
disorders and administration site conditions were the SOCs with the highest number of subjects with fatal 
events in both arms. The most common treatment-emergent adverse or outcome event with outcome 
death in the SAF are provided in Table 44. All other events occurred in 1 to 5 subjects per treatment 
arm.

Table 44 Most common treatment-emergent adverse or outcome events with outcome death 
by PT (≥0.2%): number (%) of subjects (SAF)
In the FIGARO-DKD study, the number of fatal outcome or AEs was overall slightly lower in the 
finerenone group (9.2%) than in the placebo group (10.4%). Adjudicated reasons for deaths (all-cause 
mortality) were also slightly lower for finerenone (9.0%) compared with placebo (10.1%).  Adjudicated 
CV deaths (5.2% vs 5.8%), renal deaths (0% vs <0.1%) and fatal non-CV/non-renal death (3.8% vs 
4.2%) were overall slightly lower for finerenone vs placebo, respectively. Moreover, 4.9% in the 
finerenone group and 6.0% in the placebo group died due to TEAEs or outcome events with outcome 
death. The results of the pooled analysis were similar.
Other serious adverse events
Study FIGARO-DKD
In the FIGARO-DKD study, serious TEAEs in the SAF were reported less frequently in the finerenone arm: 
1,158 subjects (31.4%) in the finerenone arm versus 1,215 subjects (33.2%) in the placebo arm. 
The 3 most frequently reported serious TEAEs in in the finerenone arm were pneumonia (2.0%), cellulitis 
(1.1%) and acute kidney injury (1.0). In the placebo arm, the 3 most frequently reported serious TEAEs 
were pneumonia (3.1%), acute kidney injury (1.3%) and urinary tract infection (1.1%, Table 45).
Serious TEAEs were assessed as severe in intensity in 503 subjects (13.7%) in the finerenone arm and in 
554 subjects (15.1%) in the placebo arm.

Page 132/172
Table 45 Most common (≥1%) serious TEAEs by PT: number (%) of subjects and incidence 
rates (SAF)
Pooled analysis of data from studies FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD
Overall, serious TEAEs in the SAF were reported less frequently in the finerenone arm: 2060 subjects 
(31.6%, 14.72 per 100 p-yrs) in the finerenone arm versus 2186 subjects (33.7%, 15.51 per 100 p-yrs) 
in the placebo arm. There were no relevant differences between FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD.
In the FIGARO-DKD study, the incidence of serious TEAEs was slightly lower for finerenone (31%) 
compared with placebo (33%). The most frequently reported serious TEAE was “pneumonia”, which 
occurred less frequently in finerenone-treated subjects (2.0%) than in placebo (3.1% placebo). The 
results of the pooled analysis were similar.
Adverse events of special interest
Hyperkalaemia
In the following subsections, the term hyperkalaemia refers to the combined MedDRA PTs blood 
potassium increased and hyperkalaemia.
Study FIGARO-DKD
In FIGARO-DKD, there was approximately a 2-fold increase in the proportion of subjects with any 
treatment-emergent hyperkalaemia in the finerenone arm compared with placebo (10.8% vs 5.3%). 
Study-drug related treatment-emergent hyperkalaemia events were reported in 6.5% of the subjects in 
the finerenone arm compared with 3.1% in the placebo arm. The number of subjects with TEAEs reported 
as serious (0.7% in the finerenone arm and 0.1% in the placebo arm). TEAEs leading to permanent 
discontinuation of study drug (1.2% in the finerenone arm and 0.4% in the placebo arm), or 
hospitalization (0.6% in the finerenone arm and <0.1% in the placebo arm) was comparatively small. 
Life-threatening hyperkalaemia events occurred in 1 subject in the finerenone arm and 2 subjects in the 
placebo arm. The events recovered in all 3 cases. No treatment-emergent hyperkalaemia event resulted 
in the subject’s death. 1 subject in the placebo arm died of post-treatment hyperkalaemia (Table 46).
In the majority of the subjects, treatment-emergent hyperkalaemia was assessed as mild or moderate as 
maximum intensity and resolved at the end of the study.
In the finerenone arm, the 396 subjects with treatment-emergent hyperkalaemia had a total of 580 such 
events reported. In the placebo arm, the 193 subjects with treatment-emergent hyperkalaemia had a 
Assessment report

total of 262 such events. In both treatment arms, the highest percentage of subjects had 1 treatment-
emergent hyperkalaemia event (281 subjects, 7.6% finerenone in the SAF; 143 subjects, 3.9% placebo). 
More recurrent events occurred in the finerenone arm than in the placebo arm (Table 47).

Table 47 Treatment-emergent adverse events: number of events in MLG Hyperkalaemia by 
treatment group (SAF)
In the FIGARO-DKD study, the incidence of hyperkalaemia was 2 times increased for finerenone versus 
placebo (10.8% vs 5.3%). Drug-related hyperkalaemia were reported in 6.5% of the subjects in the 
finerenone group compared with 3.1% in the placebo group. Serious events of hyperkalaemia were 
reported more frequently for finerenone (0.7%) than for placebo (0.1%). Moreover, a higher incidence of 
hyperkalaemia leading to permanent discontinuation (1.2% vs 0.4%) was reported for finerenone 
compared with placebo.
More subjects treated with finerenone, compared with placebo, reported one AE (7.6% vs 3.9%), two AEs 
(1.8% vs 1.0%) and three AEs (0.9% vs 0.3%) of hypokalaemia, respectively. In total, 580 events of 
hyperkalaemia were reported among 396 finerenone-treated subjects, of which 71%, 17% and 8%, 
respectively, experienced 1,2 and 3 events, respectively, of hyperkalaemia.
A higher incidence for finerenone, than for placebo, had changes in serum potassium to >5.5 mmol/L 
(13.2% vs 6.0%) and to >6.0 mmol/L (2.3% vs 1.2%), respectively, at any time during treatment.
The results of the pooled analysis were in general similar. The overall percentage of subjects with 
hyperkalaemia was generally lower in FIGARO-DKD compared with FIDELIO-DKD, including drug-related 
events of hyperkalaemia, serious events and events leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug.
The risk of hyperkalaemia is handled with monitoring of serum potassium and dose adjustments, 
including warning and precautions in the product information.
Subgroup analyses - hyperkalaemia
eGFR at baseline
The lower the eGFR at baseline, the higher the percentage of subjects with treatment emergent 
hyperkalemia: More subjects in the eGFR categories <60 mL/min/1.73m2 had treatment-emergent 
hyperkalemia compared with subjects in the higher eGFR categories and overall. This was observed in 
both treatment arms (Table 48).
Serum potassium at baseline and hyperkalemia in medical history
The higher the serum potassium at baseline, the higher the percentage of subjects with treatment-
emergent hyperkalemia. This was observed in both treatment arms. Similarly, subjects in both treatment 
arms with a medical history of hyperkalemia (based on the MLG hyperkalemia) had more treatment-
emergent hyperkalemia events during the study than subjects without hyperkalemia in their medical 
history (Table 48).
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023
Page 135/172
Age at run-in visit
In the finerenone arm, the percentage of subjects with treatment-emergent hyperkalemia increased with 
age starting with ≥65 years, while subjects between 18 and 65 years had lower percentages of subjects 
with hyperkalemia compared with the overall results. This was not seen in the placebo arm, where 
percentages of subjects were relatively stable across all age groups. The number of subjects between 18 
and 44 years of age at baseline was low (approximately 3% in both treatment arms) and results should 
be interpreted with caution (Table 48).
Comparable risk populations
In addition to the subgroup analyses presented above, the analysis of subjects with comparable risk 
focusses on those subjects from FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD with the same baseline characteristics: 
subjects with very high albuminuria and eGFR 60 to <75 mL/min/1.73m2, those with high albuminuria 
and eGFR 25 to <60 mL/min/1.73m2, and those with either of these combinations of eGFR and 
albuminuria categories is presented in Table 49.

Table 49 Study-stratified relative risk and assessment of heterogeneity for treatment-
emergent hyperkalemia by comparable risk populations (safety analysis set) - FIGARO-DKD & 
FIDELIO-DKD
In the FIGARO-DKD, the incidence of hyperkalaemia increased with decreasing renal function across eGFR 
strata: eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2 (7.2% vs 3.8%), eGFR 45 ≤60 mL/min/1.73m2 (12.9% vs 6.2%) and 
eGFR 25-45 mL/min/1.73m2 (20.7% vs 9.2%). This was seen for the studies individually as well as in the 
pooled analysis of FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD.
Moreover, there were higher frequencies of treatment-emergent hyperkalemia in higher baseline serum 
potassium categories in both treatment arms. 
In the finerenone group, incidences of hyperkalaemia were slightly higher for subjects 65 years or older 
(13-15%) and lower incidences were observed in subjects 45-64 years (8%) compared to the overall 
population (11%). The number of subjects in the age group 18-44 years is too limited (n<10) to draw 
any conclusions. 
Worsening of renal function
An overview of the number of subjects with treatment-emergent events related to worsening of renal 
function including laboratory eGFR values by category is provided in Table 50.
The overall number of subjects with treatment-emergent worsening renal function requiring 
hospitalization is presented in Table 51.
The overall number of subjects with permanent discontinuation of study drug due to treatment-emergent 
worsening renal function is presented in Table 52.
eGFR relative decrease of ≥30%, ≥40%, ≥50% or ≥57%: change in subgroup values
Most subjects in both groups had a relative eGFR decrease of ≥30% or ≥40% with a higher percentage of 
subjects in the finerenone arm (42.5% and 21.7%, respectively) compared to placebo (36.9% and 
20.3%, respectively). The proportion of subjects with a decline in eGFR of ≥57% was lower in the 
finerenone arm (5.0%) than in the placebo arm (6.3%). The results of FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD 
are largely comparable with a higher percentage of subjects with changes in eGFR in all categories in 
FIDELIO-DKD (Table 50).
eGFR over time
A decline in eGFR over time was observed in both treatment arms, as expected based on the known 
progressive course of the underlying disease. In line with its mode of action, a larger decrease in eGFR 
was observed for subjects in the finerenone arm with a mean difference between finerenone and placebo 
of approximately 2.0 mL/min/1.73m2 up to Month 4. Thereafter, an attenuated decline in eGFR was 
observed in the finerenone arm compared to placebo Figure 52.

SMQ acute renal failure: narrow and broad search
Numbers of subjects with TEAEs and incidence rates using the narrow and broad search of the SMQ acute 
renal failure are provided in Table 53. In the narrow search of the SMQ acute renal failure, the 
percentage of subjects with TEAE is balanced between the treatment groups overall and for both, 
FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD. However, the percentage of subjects with acute renal failure events is 
higher in FIDELIO-DKD than in FIGARO-DKD for both finerenone and placebo. In the broad search of the 
SMQ acute renal failure, the percentage of subjects with TEAE is higher in the finerenone arm than in the 
placebo arm. This result is driven by the results of FIDELIO-DKD, in which 17.8% of subjects in the 
finerenone arm and 16.3% of subjects in the placebo arm reported TEAEs related to acute renal failure. 
This difference is seen in the SOC investigations and mainly driven by the TEAE decreased GFR (6.3% of 
subjects in the finerenone arm vs 4.7% in the placebo arm).

The incidence of ‘eGFR decreased’ for finerenone and placebo, respectively, was 4.6% and 3.9% in the 
FIGARO-DKD and 5.3% and 4.2% in the pooled analysis of FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD.  In FIGARO-
DKD, more subjects in the finerenone group compared to placebo had a relative eGFR decrease of ≥30% 
(40.2% vs 32.0%) and ≥40% (19.4% vs 16.8%); however, the proportion of subjects with a decline in 
eGFR of ≥50% was balanced between finerenone and placebo (8.2% and 8.0%). The results of the 
pooled analysis were in general similar; although, a higher percentage of subjects in FIDELIO-DKD 
showed a relative eGFR decrease across all eGFR categories compared with FIGARO-DKD, for both 
finerenone and placebo.  
There was an initial decrease in eGFR in the finerenone group compared with placebo group, with a mean 
difference between finerenone and placebo of approximately 2 mL/min/1.73 m2 up to month 4. Over 
time, the eGFR declined more in the placebo group than in the finerenone group.
In FIGARO-DKD, the incidence of TEAEs in the SOC Renal and urinary disorders (source: Table 
14.3.1.1/4, PH-42134) was slightly higher for placebo (15.0%) than for finerenone (13.4%), of which the 
incidence of ‘acute kidney injury’ (2.5% vs 2.7%) was balanced. However, the incidence of drug-related 
‘acute kidney injury’ was increased for finerenone versus placebo (0.5% vs 0.2%). 
The incidence of subjects with at least 1 event of ‘acute renal failure’ (SMQ broad search), was higher for 
finerenone than for placebo in both FIGARO-DKD (11.6% vs 10.1%) and FIDELIO-DKD (17.8% vs 
16.3%); although more events of TEAEs in SMQ acute renal failure were reported in the FIDELO-DKD.

The incidence of SAEs in the SOC of Renal and urinary disorders (2.8% vs 3.4%), including ‘acute kidney 
injury’ (1.0% vs 1.3%) was slightly higher for placebo or balanced. The incidence of serious events of 
‘eGFR decreased’ was low for finerenone (0.1%) and placebo (<0.1%).
The number of subjects with permanent discontinuation of study drug due to worsening of renal function 
was higher in the finerenone group (0.7%) compared with the placebo group (0.3%); however, 
treatment-emergent worsening of renal function requiring hospitalization was balanced for finerenone and 
placebo (1.1% vs 1.3%).

In the FIGARO-DKD, a decrease in mean haemoglobin (<0.17 g/dL) and mean haematocrit (<0.85%) 
levels was observed in the first 4 months in the finerenone arm compared to placebo. The difference 
between finerenone and placebo became smaller over time. Data is consistent with data from the 
FIDELIO study.
“Decreased hemoglobin” is included in section 4.8 of the current SmPC for Kerendia.
Serum sodium
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023
Page 142/172
In the FIGARO-DKD, an initial decrease in mean serum sodium (approximately 0.8 mmol/L) was observed 
in the finerenone-treated subjects in the first month of treatment compared to placebo, followed 
thereafter by a progressive gradual increase over time in both treatment arms, although the increase 
observed was smaller in the finerenone arm.
In the FIGARO-DKD, an initial decrease in mean serum sodium (approximately 0.8 mmol/L) was observed 
for finerenone compared with placebo. This was in line with the decrease in mean serum sodium in the 
FIDELIO-DKD study (approximately 0.7 mmol/L).
“Hyponatremia” is included in section 4.8 of the current SmPC for Kerendia.
Serum potassium
In the FIGARO-DKD, an increase from baseline in mean serum potassium of approximately 0.15 mmol/L 
was observed in the finerenone arm compared to placebo over the course of the study. In the finerenone 
arm, the mean change in potassium was approximately 0.17 mmol/L (SD approx. 0.4) at Month 1 
(compared to approx. 0.02 mmol/L (SD approx. 0.4) in the placebo arm), with generally stable 
measurements thereafter. The maximum mean increase in serum potassium with finerenone (0.19 
mmol/L) was observed at Month 8. 
In pooled data from FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD, an increase from baseline in mean serum potassium 
of approximately 0.18 mmol/L was observed in the finerenone arm compared with placebo from Month 1 
to Month 20 (range 0.17 to 0.19 mmol/L). A gradual increase of mean serum potassium values was 
observed in the finerenone arm until Month 20, with decreasing mean values thereafter, while the mean 
serum potassium values in the placebo arm were relatively stable throughout the observation period.
In the pooled analysis of data from FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD, a change in potassium to >5.5 
mmol/L at any time during treatment was reported for 16.8% of subjects in the finerenone arm and 7.4% 
of subject in the placebo arm. A change in potassium to >6.0 mmol/L at any time during treatment was 
reported for 3.3 % of subjects in the finerenone arm and 1.2 % in the placebo arm. The results for 
FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD were comparable, considering that a higher percentage of subjects in 
both treatment arms reported elevated serum potassium levels in FIDELIO-DKD (Table 54).

In the FIGARO-DKD, an initial placebo-corrected increase in mean serum uric acid of approximately 0.25 
to 0.3 mg/dL was observed in the finerenone arm from Month 1 to Month 16 compared to baseline. 
Thereafter, an attenuated increase compared to baseline in uric acid was observed in the finerenone arm 
compared to placebo. The highest mean value for uric acid in the finerenone arm was 6.779 mg/dL at 
Month 1 (excluding up-titration visits); the highest individual uric acid measurement in the finerenone 
arm was 17.16 mg/dL (Month 16). In the placebo arm, the highest mean value for uric acid was 6.561 
mg/dL at Month 1 and the highest individual uric acid measurement was 18.44 mg/dL (Month 28). 
Hyperuricemia TEAEs (4.5% in the finerenone arm; 2.8% in the placebo arm) was noted in the FIGARO-
DKD.
Treatment-emergent gout was reported in 104 subjects (2.8%) in the finerenone arm and 90 subjects 
(2.5%) in the placebo arm and was reported as serious in 2 subjects each in the finerenone and placebo 
arms. Treatment-emergent gouty arthritis was reported in 15 subjects (0.4%) in the finerenone arm and 
18 subjects (0.5%) in the placebo arm and reported as serious in no subject in the finerenone arm and 2 
subjects in the placebo arm. Treatment-emergent nephrolithiasis was reported in 50 subjects (1.4%) in 
the finerenone arm and 55 subjects (1.5%) in the placebo arm and was reported as serious in 12 
subjects (0.3%) in the finerenone arm and 8 subjects (0.2%) in the placebo arm. 
In summary, the incidence of hyperuricaemia was increased for finerenone compared with placebo (4.5% 
vs 2.8%).  No imbalances of gout (2.8% vs 2.5%), gouty arthritis (0.4% vs 0.5%) or nephrolithiasis 
(1.4% vs 1.5%) were identified. “Hyperuricaemia” has been proposed to be included in section 4.8 of the 
proposed amended SmPC, which is accepted.
Vital signs
Blood pressure
In FIGARO-DKD, the mean SBP in the finerenone arm was reduced by approximately 2-3 mmHg 
compared to placebo at month 1, and the reduction remained generally stable thereafter. The mean DBP 
in the finerenone arm was reduced by approximately 1-2 mmHg compared to placebo in the first 
36 months. No clinically relevant effect on heart rate, weight or BMI was observed during treatment with 
finerenone or placebo
In FIGARO-DKD, the mean SBP in the finerenone arm was reduced by approximately 2-3 mmHg 
compared to placebo at month 1, and the reduction remained generally stable thereafter. The mean DBP 
in the finerenone arm was reduced by approximately 1-2 mmHg compared to placebo in the first 
36 months. Similar reductions in SBP and DBP was noted in the FIDELIO-DKD study (DBP: 2-3 mmHg; 
DBP: 1-2 mmHg). 
Hypotension occurred more frequently in subjects in the finerenone group (4.2%) than in the placebo 
group (2.5%). Events associated with hypotension such as syncope (1.2% vs 1.4%) and fall (0.7% vs 
0.7%) was balanced between the groups, but dizziness (5.3% vs 4.6%) was slightly increased for 
finerenone compared with placebo. The incidence of serious hypotension (<0.1% vs <0.1%) and serious 
dizziness was low and balanced (0.2% vs 0.2%).
Information on decreased SBP/DBP is included in section 4.4 of the current SmPC for Kerendia.
Heart rate 
In the FIGARO-DKD, no clinically relevant effect on heart rate was observed based on mean and median 
changes during treatment. In both treatment arms, mean change from baseline fluctuated around 0 over 
the course of the study.
ECG
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023
Page 144/172
As in FIDELIO-DKD, standard 12-lead ECGs were performed in FIGARO-DKD with local investigator 
interpretation at specified times. A 12-lead ECG was also to be obtained if serum potassium levels 
exceeded 6.5 mmol/L. Clinically relevant abnormalities were reported either as an AE or outcome event 
(e.g., new onset atrial fibrillation). 
In the FIDELIO-DKD, abnormal ECG findings were reported, of which the following were considered likely 
to be related to hyperkalaemia: e.g., peaked T-waves, bundle branch block, bradycardia, sinus 
bradycardia and 1st degree AV block. Overall, there were no unexpected ECG changes in the finerenone 
group.
Weight/BMI
The Applicant has clarified that no clinically relevant effect was observed on body weight or BMI with 
finerenone compared to placebo. 
In the FIDELIO-DKD, the number of any AEs was slightly higher in finerenone group compared with 
placebo across all the BMI categories. However, SAEs were comparable between finerenone and placebo 
or slightly lower for finerenone in some subgroups. The slight difference between finerenone and placebo 
did not have any impact on safety across the BMI subgroups.
Safety in special populations
Integrated data from the FIDELIO-DKD and the FIGARO-DKD studies was provided for the subgroup 
analyses below:
Effect by age
In the pooled analysis of FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD, the percentage of subjects with TEAEs, 
including drug-related TEAEs and serious TEAEs, was marginally higher in subjects ≥65 years compared 
to those <65 years. However, this was observed to a similar extent in both treatment arms (Table 55, 
Table 56).

The reporting rate was overall similar across the age groups. Slightly more TESAEs were reported in the 
age group ≥75 years (36.0% vs 37.8%) compared to subjects 65-74 years (33.1% vs 34.0%) and <65 
years (29.0% vs 32.1%); however, the incidence of SAEs was higher for placebo than for finerenone in 
all age groups.
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023

More subjects discontinued due to an AE in the finerenone group compared with placebo in the subgroups 
≥75 years (8.0% vs 7.5%) and 65-74 years (8.1% vs 5.9%); however, the discontinuation rate due to 
AEs was balanced (4.3% vs 4.2%) in subjects <65 years. 
Effect by sex
The pooled analysis of subjects with TEAE by sex is presented in Table 57.
Table 57 Overall summary of number of subjects with TEAE by sex (SAF) pooled analysis of 
FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD
Female subjects made up for approximately one third of the overall Phase 3 study population. No notable 
differences between males and females were noted, apart from that the incidence of subjects that 
discontinued due to an AE that was increased for finerenone compared with placebo (7.0% vs 5.4%) in 
males and was more balanced in females (5.0% than 5.4%).
Effect by race
The pooled analysis of subjects with TEAE by race is presented in Table 58. In the pooled analysis of 
FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD, the percentage of subjects with TEAEs was overall balanced between the 
treatment arms for all race groups.

EMA/41550/2023
Page 147/172
Table 58 Overall summary of number of subjects with TEAE by race (SAF) - pooled analysis of 
FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD
The incidence of AEs was about 82%-90% in White, Black and ‘Other subjects’ and was slightly higher in 
Asian subjects (93-94%). The difference was mainly driven by a higher number of subjects with AEs of 
mild intensity in the Asian race group (39%-42%) compared to the other race groups (21-26%).
Effect by hepatic impairment
Subjects with hepatic impairment were identified using 2 approaches: based on medical history findings 
and laboratory values. For the assessment based on medical history the SMQ hepatic disorders (excl. 
sub-SMQs liver-related investigations, signs and symptoms and liver-related coagulation and bleeding 
disturbances) was used. An approximation of the Child Pugh classification was calculated based on total 
bilirubin and albumin in serum at baseline.
A summary of number of subjects with TEAE by hepatic impairment in medical history is presented Table 
59.
An overview of the number of subjects with TEAE by Child Pugh classification in the pooled analysis of 
FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD is provided in Table 60.

pooled analysis of FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD
The Applicant presented overall summary by hepatic impairment: “subjects with no hepatic impairment” 
(n=10,832) and “subjects with hepatic impairment” (n=2,167). The incidence of subjects with any TEAE 
and any TESAE, respectively, was slightly higher in subjects with hepatic impairment (TEAEs:90%; 
TESAEs:38%-39%) compared to those without hepatic impairment in the medical history (TEAEs:85%-
86%; TESAEs:30%-33%), in both treatment groups. The Applicant also presented an overview of 
subjects with AE by Child Pugh classification: “likely Child Pugh A” (n=12,483), “likely Child Pugh B” 
(n=498) and “certain Child Pugh B” (n=13). However, the Child-Pugh score system is mainly used for 
assessing the prognosis of chronic liver disease, primarily cirrhosis. Since prothrombin time or INR were 
not analysed in the study and, therefore, a proper Child-Pugh classification could not be done. Therefore, 
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023
Page 149/172
the severity classification “mild”, “moderate” and severe” hepatic impairment should be used in the 
wording in the SmPC instead of the Child-Pugh classification.
Effect by renal impairment
An overall summary of number of subjects with TEAE by baseline eGFR category, in the pooled analysis of 
FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD, have been presented in Table 61.
The number of subjects with treatment-emergent worsening of renal function leading to hospitalization

In the pooled analysis of FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD, approximately 1.2% of the subjects had 
baseline eGFR<25 mL/min/1.73m2, 32% eGFR 25 -<45 mL/min/1.73m2, 26% eGFR 45 - <60 
mL/min/1.73m2 and 40% eGFR eGFR>60 mL/min/1.73m2. The number of subjects with eGFR<25 
mL/min/1.73m2 was too limited to draw any firm conclusions.
Subjects with lower eGFR at baseline reported overall more TEAEs and TESAEs compared to subjects with 
higher eGFR at baseline although the incidences were balanced for finerenone and placebo, or higher for 
placebo, across the eGFR strata: eGFR 25 -<45 mL/min/1.73m2 (TEAEs:88.1% vs 88.4% and 
TESAEs:33.7% vs 36.1%), eGFR 45 - <60 mL/min/1.73m2 (TEAEs:87.2% vs 87.3% and TESAEs:33.2% 
and 35.3%) and eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73m2(TEAEs: 83.5% vs 84.0% and TESAEs: 28.9% and 30.1%). 
However, the incidence of study-drug related AEs was increased for finerenone compared with placebo 
across the subgroups: eGFR 25 -<45 mL/min/1.73m2 (25.3% vs 17.4%), eGFR 45 - <60 mL/min/1.73m2 
(18.4% vs 13.8%) and eGFR>60 mL/min/1.73m2 (12.7% vs 9.5%). Study-drug related SAEs was 
increased for finerenone compared with placebo in subjects with eGFR 25 -<45 mL/min/1.73m2 (2.2% vs 
1.4%) and eGFR 45 - <60 mL/min/1.73m2 (1.2% vs 0.8%) and was balanced in subjects with eGFR>60 
mL/min/1.73m2 (0.5% vs 0.6%).
The incidence of subjects with any AE leading to discontinuation of study drug was increased for 
finerenone compared with placebo in subjects with eGFR 25 -<45 mL/min/1.73m2 (8.7% vs 6.7%) and 
eGFR 45 - <60 mL/min/1.73m2 (6.8% vs 5.3%) and was slightly higher for placebo in subjects with 
eGFR>60 mL/min/1.73m2 (3.8% vs 4.3%). 
The risk of hyperkalaemia increased with decreasing renal function across eGFR strata: ≥60 
mL/min/1.73m2 (7.6% vs 4.4%), 45 -<60 mL/min/1.73m2 (13.9% vs 6.2%) and 25-45 mL/min/1.73m2 
(21.6% vs 10.2%). 
Finerenone is not recommended in subjects with eGFR <25 mL/min/1.73m2 due to limited data. 
Effect by albuminuria
In the FIGARO study, subjects with high albuminuria (AEs:87.4% vs 88.2%; SAEs:35.2% vs 36.6%) 
reported overall more AEs and SAEs compared to subjects with very high albuminuria (AEs:82.8% vs 
83.2%; SAEs:27.9% vs 30.4%) at baseline although the incidences were higher for placebo. The 
incidences of drug-related AEs were more increased in subjects with high albuminuria (19.0% vs 14.3%) 
compared with subjects with very high albuminuria (11.4% vs 8.6%). Moreover, the incidence of any AE 
leading to study drug discontinuation was more increased for finerenone than for placebo in subjects with 
high albuminuria (7.7% vs 6.2%) compared with subjects with very high albuminuria (3.7% vs 3.8%). 
The data was similar for the pooled analysis of data from FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD.

Table 67 Number of subjects with MLG: Hyperkalemia by Baseline UACR (safety analysis set) - 
FIGARO-DKD & FIDELIO-DKD
In the subgroup with UACR <300 mg/g, the majority of patients (66%) had a baseline eGFR <60 
mL/min/1.73m2 in the FIGARO study. However, in the subgroup with UACR ≥300 mg/g, most subjects 
(88%) had a baseline eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2. Thus, the incidence of drug-related AEs and for AEs 
leading to study drug discontinuation is most likely driven by the worsening of kidney function, rather 
than the degree of albuminuria. The same trend is seen with treatment-emergent hyperkalaemia, where 
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023
Page 153/172
the number of subjects with hyperkalaemia events increased with decreasing renal function, independent 
of the degree of albuminuria.
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions
Concomitant use of finerenone with medications that impair potassium excretion and increase serum 
potassium, may increase the risk of hyperkalaemia. See product information of the current SmPC for 
Kerendia.
Discontinuation due to adverse events
TEAEs resulting in permanent discontinuation of study drug were reported more frequently in the 
finerenone arm: 207 subjects (5.6%) in the finerenone arm and 183 subjects (5.0%) in the placebo arm. 
This difference is driven by the higher number of subjects permanently discontinuing study drug due to 
hyperkalaemia events (i.e. hyperkalaemia and increased blood potassium; Table 68). 
The numbers of subjects with serious TEAEs resulting in permanent discontinuation of study drug was low 
in both treatment arms (1.9% vs 2.1%). The most frequent serious TEAEs resulting in permanent 
discontinuation of study drug in the finerenone arm were acute kidney injury (6 subjects, 0.2%) and 
hyperkalaemia (5 subjects, 0.1%). All other serious TEAEs resulting in permanent discontinuation of 
study drug in the finerenone arm and all events in the placebo arm were reported in <0.1% of the 
subjects.
Table 68 Most common (>0.1%) TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug by 
SOC and PT: number (%) of subjects and incidence rates (SAF) 
In FIGARO-DKD, TEAEs resulting in permanent discontinuation of study drug were reported slightly more 
frequently for finerenone (5.6%) than for placebo (5.0%), driven mostly by hyperkalaemia (1.0% vs 
0.3% for finerenone vs placebo).

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety
The safety result of FIGARO-DKD was presented individually followed by a summary of the pooled 
analysis of FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD. Similar safety data was overall seen from the pooled analysis 
of data from the FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD studies.
In FIGARO-DKD, the overall exposure was 17,149 PY for finerenone and 17,221 PY for placebo. Mean 
duration of exposure was about 35 months; 90% of the subjects were exposed for at least 52 weeks, 
81% for at least 2 years, 50% for at least 3 years and 22% for at least 4 years.
The number of TEAEs was balanced for finerenone (85.1%) and placebo (85.5%); however, the incidence 
of drug-related TEAEs was increased for finerenone (15.2%) compared with placebo (11.3%). The 
maximum intensity for any AE in most subjects (about 67%) was mild or moderate. The most reported 
TEAE was hyperkalaemia (10.8% vs 5.3%). 
The incidence of serious TEAEs was slightly higher in the placebo group (33.2%) than in the finerenone 
group (31.4%). The most frequently reported serious TEAE was “pneumonia”, which occurred less 
frequently in finerenone-treated subjects (2.0%) than in placebo (3.1% placebo). The number of fatal 
outcomes or adverse events was lower in the finerenone group (9.2%) compared with the placebo group 
(10.4%). Overall, 4.9% in the finerenone arm and 6.0% in the placebo arm died due to treatment-
emergent adverse or outcome event. 
Discontinuation rate due to TEAE was slightly higher for finerenone (5.6%) than for placebo (5.0%).  The 
most frequently reported TEAE leading to study drug discontinuation for finerenone vs placebo was 
hyperkalaemia (1.2% vs 0.4%). 
Hyperkalaemia
The incidence of hyperkalaemia was 2 times increased for finerenone versus placebo (10.8% vs 5.3%). 
Drug-related hyperkalaemia were reported in 6.5% of the subjects in the finerenone group compared 
with 3.1% in the placebo group. Serious events of hyperkalaemia were reported more frequently for 
finerenone (0.7%) than for placebo (0.1%). Moreover, a higher incidence of hyperkalaemia leading to 
discontinuation (1.2% vs 0.4%) and hospitalization (0.6% vs <0.1%) was reported for finerenone 
compared with placebo.
In total, 580 events of hyperkalaemia were reported among 396 finerenone-treated subjects, of which 
71%, 17% and 8%, respectively, experienced 1,2 and 3 events, respectively, of hyperkalaemia.
A higher incidence for finerenone, than for placebo, had changes in serum potassium to >5.5 mmol/L 
(13.2% vs 6.0%) and to >6.0 mmol/L (2.3% vs 1.2%), respectively, at any time during treatment.
Decreased eGFR and renal events
The incidence of ‘eGFR decreased’ was increased for finerenone (4.6%) compared with placebo (3.9%). 
The incidence of renal AEs was slightly higher for placebo (15.0%) than for finerenone (13.4%), of which 
the incidence of ‘acute kidney injury’ was balanced (2.5% vs 2.7%). However, the incidence of drug-
related ‘acute kidney injury’ was increased for finerenone (0.5%) versus placebo (0.2%).
The incidence of SAEs in the SOC of Renal and urinary disorders (2.8% vs 3.4%), including ‘acute kidney 
injury’ (1.0% vs 1.3%) was slightly higher for placebo or balanced. The incidence of serious events of 
‘eGFR decreased’ was low for finerenone (0.1%) and placebo (<0.1%)
Laboratory findings, vital signs
Haematocrit
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023
Page 155/172
A decrease in mean haemoglobin (<0.17g/dL) and mean haematocrit (<0.85%) levels was observed in 
the first 4 months in the finerenone arm compared to placebo. Further analysis on changes in 
haemoglobin and haematocrit in the FIGARO-DKD study over time are consistent with previous data from 
the FIDELIO study. Changes in haemoglobin are already covered in section 4,8 of the SmPC.
Blood pressure
The mean SBP in the finerenone arm was reduced by approximately 2-3 mmHg compared to placebo at 
month 1, and the reduction remained generally stable thereafter. The mean DBP in the finerenone arm 
was reduced by approximately 1-2 mmHg compared to placebo in the first 36 months.
Hypotension occurred more frequently in subjects in the finerenone group (4.2%) than in the placebo 
group (2.5%). Events associated with hypotension such as syncope (1.2% vs 1.4%) and fall (0.7% vs 
0.7%) was balanced between the groups, but dizziness (5.3% vs 4.6%) was slightly increased for 
finerenone compared with placebo. The incidence of serious hypotension (<0.1% vs <0.1%) and serious 
dizziness was low and balanced (0.2% vs 0.2%).
Serum urea
The incidence of hyperuricaemia was increased for finerenone compared with placebo (4.5% vs 2.8%).  
No imbalances of gout (2.8% vs 2.5%), gouty arthritis (0.4% vs 0.5%) or nephrolithiasis (1.4% vs 1.5%) 
were identified.
Serum sodium
An initial decrease in mean serum sodium (approximately 0.8 mmol/L) was observed in the finerenone-
treated subjects in the first month of treatment compared to placebo, followed thereafter by a 
progressive gradual increase over time in both treatment arms, although the increase observed was 
smaller in the finerenone arm
Subgroups
Integrated data from the FIDELIO-DKD and the FIGARO-DKD studies was provided for the subgroup 
analyses below:
Effect by age
In the pooled analysis of FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD, the reporting rate was overall similar across 
the age groups. Slightly more SAEs were reported in the age group ≥75 years (36.0% vs 37.8%) 
compared to subjects 65-74 years (33.1% vs 34.0%) and <65 years (29.0% vs 32.1%); however, the 
incidence of SAEs was higher for placebo than for finerenone in all age groups.
More subjects discontinued due to an AE in the finerenone group compared with placebo in the subgroups 
≥75 years (8.0% vs 7.5%) and 65-74 years (8.1% vs 5.9%); however, the discontinuation rate due to 
AEs was balanced (4.3% vs 4.2%) in subjects <65 years.
Effect by sex
In the pooled analysis of FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD, female subjects made up for approximately one 
third of the overall Phase 3 study population. No notable differences between males and females were 
noted, apart from that the incidence of subjects that discontinued due to an AE that was increased for 
finerenone compared with placebo (7.0% vs 5.4%) in males and was more balanced in females (5.0% 
than 5.4%).
Effect by race
In the pooled analysis of FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD, the incidence of AEs was about 82%-90% in 
White, Black and ‘Other subjects’ and was slightly higher in Asian subjects (93-94%). The difference was 
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023
Page 156/172
mainly driven by a higher number of subjects with AEs of mild intensity in the Asian race group (39%-
42%) compared to the other race groups (21-26%).
Effect by hepatic impairment
In the pooled analysis of FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD, the incidence of subjects with any AE and any 
SAE, respectively, was slightly higher in subjects with hepatic impairment (AEs:90%; SAEs:38%-39%) 
compared to those without hepatic impairment in the medical history (AEs:85%-86%; SAEs:30%-33%), 
in both treatment groups.
Effect by renal function
In the pooled analysis of FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD, approximately 32% of the subjects had 
baseline eGFR 25 -<45 mL/min/1.73m2, 26% eGFR 45 - <60 mL/min/1.73m2 and 40% eGFR eGFR>60 
mL/min/1.73m2. The number of subjects with eGFR<25 mL/min/1.73m2 (1.2%) was too limited to draw 
any firm conclusions. Finerenone is not recommended in subjects with eGFR <25 mL/min/1.73m2 due to 
limited data. 
Subjects with lower eGFR at baseline reported overall more AEs and SAEs compared to subjects with 
higher eGFR at baseline although the incidences were balanced for finerenone and placebo, or higher for 
placebo, across the eGFR strata: eGFR 25 -<45 mL/min/1.73m2 (AEs:88.1% vs 88.4% and SAEs:33.7% 
vs 36.1%), eGFR 45 - <60 mL/min/1.73m2 (AEs:87.2% vs 87.3% and SAEs:33.2% and 35.3%) and 
eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73m2(AEs: 83.5% vs 84.0% and SAEs: 28.9% and 30.1%).
However, the incidence of study-drug related AEs was increased for finerenone compared with placebo 
across the subgroups: eGFR 25 -<45 mL/min/1.73m2 (25.3% vs 17.4%), eGFR 45 - <60 mL/min/1.73m2 
(18.4% vs 13.8%) and eGFR>60 mL/min/1.73m2 (12.7% vs 9.5%). Study-drug related SAEs was 
increased for finerenone compared with placebo in subjects with eGFR 25 -<45 mL/min/1.73m2 (2.2% vs 
1.4%) and eGFR 45 - <60 mL/min/1.73m2 (1.2% vs 0.8%) and was balanced in subjects with eGFR>60 
mL/min/1.73m2 (0.5% vs 0.6%).
The incidence of subjects with any AE leading to discontinuation of study drug was increased for 
finerenone compared with placebo in subjects with eGFR 25 -<45 mL/min/1.73m2 (8.7% vs 6.7%) and 
eGFR 45 - <60 mL/min/1.73m2 (6.8% vs 5.3%) and was slightly higher for placebo in subjects with 
eGFR>60 mL/min/1.73m2 (3.8% vs 4.3%). 
The risk of hyperkalaemia increased with decreasing renal function across eGFR strata: ≥60 
mL/min/1.73m2 (7.6% vs 4.4%), 45 -<60 mL/min/1.73m2 (13.9% vs 6.2%) and 25-45 mL/min/1.73m2 
(21.6% vs 10.2%). 
Effect by albuminuria
In the FIGARO study, subjects with high albuminuria (AEs:87.4% vs 88.2%; SAEs:35.2% vs 36.6%) 
reported overall more AEs and SAEs compared to subjects with very high albuminuria (AEs:82.8% vs 
83.2%; SAEs:27.9% vs 30.4%) at baseline although the incidences were higher for placebo. The 
incidences of drug-related AEs were more increased in subjects with high albuminuria (19.0% vs 14.3%) 
compared with subjects with very high albuminuria (11.4% vs 8.6%). Moreover, the incidence of any AE 
leading to study drug discontinuation was more increased for finerenone than for placebo in subjects with 
high albuminuria (7.7% vs 6.2%) compared with subjects with very high albuminuria (3.7% vs 3.8%). 
The data was similar for the pooled analysis of data from FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD. 
In the subgroup with UACR <300 mg/g, the majority of patients (66%) had a baseline eGFR <60 
mL/min/1.73m2 in the FIGARO study. However, in the subgroup with UACR ≥300 mg/g, most subjects 
(88%) had a baseline eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2. Thus, the incidence of drug-related AEs and for AEs 
leading to study drug discontinuation is most likely driven by the worsening of kidney function, rather

than the degree of albuminuria. The same trend is seen with treatment-emergent hyperkalaemia, where 
the number of subjects with hyperkalaemia events increased with decreasing renal function, independent 
of the degree of albuminuria.
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety
Kerendia is indicated for the treatment of CKD (stage 3 and 4 with albuminuria) associated with type 2 
diabetes in adults. The main evidence of efficacy submitted to support the indication was the FIDELIO-
DKD study in T2DM patients with CKD (mean eGFR 44 mL/min/1.73 m2) and albuminuria (mean UACR 
806 mg/g). The FIGARO-DKD study included T2DM patients with CKD (mean eGFR 68 mL/min/1.73 m2) 
and albuminuria (mean UACR 287 mg/g). The cumulative exposure was lower in FIDELIO-DKD compared 
with FIGARO-DKD, due to the overall shorter observation time in FIDELIO-DKD. Mean duration of 
exposure in FIGARO-DKD was about 35 months and in FIDELIO-DKD about 27.5 months.
The major safety concern in the FIDELIO-DKD study was hyperkalaemia that increased with decreasing 
renal function. SAEs of hyperkalaemia were reported more frequently for finerenone than for placebo and 
a higher incidence of hyperkalaemia leading to discontinuation and to hospitalisation was reported for 
finerenone compared with placebo. The risk for serious events of hyperkalaemia for Kerendia is handled 
with routine risk minimisation.
The safety profile for finerenone in the FIGARO-DKD study was overall similar compared with previously 
identified adverse drug reactions for finerenone in the FIDELIO-DKD study, with hyperkalaemia as the 
main safety concern. The incidence of hyperkalaemia was two-fold increased for finerenone compared 
with placebo in the FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD studies, respectively; although, the incidences were 
overall lower in the FIGARO-DKD with a population that had a better-preserved kidney function.
In the FIGARO-DKD study, the incidence of hyperuricaemia was increased for finerenone compared with 
placebo (4.5% vs 2.8%). No imbalances of gout (2.8% vs 2.5%), gouty arthritis (0.4% vs 0.5%) or 
nephrolithiasis (1.4% vs 1.5%) were identified.
In the FIGARO-DKD study, 46% of the subjects had high albuminuria at baseline (UACR 30 mg/g ≤300 
mg) and about 51% had very high albuminuria (UACR ≥300 mg/g). The incidences of drug-related AEs 
(high albuminuria: 19.0% vs 14.3%; very high albuminuria:11.4% vs 8.6%) and AEs leading to study 
drug discontinuation (high albuminuria: 7.7% vs 6.2%; very high albuminuria: 3.7% vs 3.8%) were 
higher in subjects with high albuminuria compared with subjects with very high albuminuria. The data 
was similar for the pooled analysis of data from FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD and is most likely driven 
by the worsening of kidney function rather than the degree of albuminuria. In the subgroup with UACR 
<300 mg/g, the majority of patients (66%) had a baseline eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2; however, in the 
subgroup with UACR ≥300 mg/g, most subjects (88%) had a baseline eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance
3.1.  Therapeutic Context
3.1.1.  Disease or condition
Initially proposed new indication for finerenone:
Kerendia is indicated for the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and for the prevention of 
cardiovascular (CV) events in adults with CKD (stage 3 and 4 with albuminuria) associated with type 
2 diabetes in adults.
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023
Page 161/172
For study results with respect to renal and CV events in the population studied, see section 
5.1.
Applicant’s updated proposed indication:
Kerendia is indicated for the treatment of chronic kidney disease (stage 3 and 4 with albuminuria) 
associated with type 2 diabetes in adults.
For study results with respect to renal and cardiovascular events, see section 5.1.
Compared to the previous round, the applicant has agreed to modify the reference to 5.1 and replace 
“cardiovascular protection” with “renal and cardiovascular events”.
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need
For the treatment of chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, ACEis and ARBs constitute the current 
standard of care. SGLT2-inhibitors, initially approved in 2013 for improving glycaemic control in T2D, 
have recently been shown to provide additional kidney and cardiovascular benefits in patients with CKD 
and T2D. CKD in T2D is progressive and irreversible with a close connection to ESRD and cardiovascular 
disease, leading to the need for renal replacement therapy. 
The pathophysiology of CKD in T2D is multifactorial and there is a need for further effective therapies to 
address the complex and numerous underlying disease mechanisms.
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies
The application for variation is based on efficacy data from the FIGARO-DKD study encompassing 7334 
patients with CKD and T2D treated with the individual maximum tolerated labelled dose of either an ACEI 
or an ARB. The study was event driven and the primary objective was to demonstrate whether, in 
addition to standard of care, finerenone is superior to placebo in delaying the time to first occurrence of 
CV mortality and morbidity. The secondary objective was to determine whether finerenone was superior 
to placebo in delaying the progression of kidney disease. Thus, the first secondary endpoint in the 
FIGARO-DKD study was the primary endpoint in FIDELIO-DKD study and vice versa.
3.2.  Favourable effects
Primary endpoint
Treatment with finerenone resulted in a 13% relative risk reduction compared with placebo for the CV 
composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for 
heart failure (HR 0.87 [95% CI 0.76; 0.98]; p=0.0264). The primary endpoint of the FIGARO-DKD study 
was thus met. The effect is driven by hospitalizations due to heart failure (HR 0.71 [95% CI 0.56; 0.90]; 
p=0.0043). The components non-fatal stroke and non-fatal MI were unchanged by the treatment whereas 
CV death was numerically slightly lower in the finerenone compared to the placebo arm.
The Kaplan-Meier curves did separate starting 6 months after treatment initiation, which indicates a 
sustained effect. The absolute risk reduction based on Kaplan-Meier cumulative incidences for the primary 
CV endpoint was 2.0% at Month 36 and 2.1% at Month 42, corresponding to NNTs to prevent one 
primary endpoint event of 51 and 47 subjects, respectively.
Secondary endpoints
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023
Page 162/172
Treatment with finerenone resulted in a 13% relative hazard reduction compared with placebo of the first 
secondary endpoint time to the first occurrence of onset of kidney failure, a sustained decrease of eGFR ≥
40% from baseline over at least 4 weeks, or renal death (HR 0.87 [95% CI 0.76; 1.01] p=0.0689]) but 
the result did however not reach statistical significance and the remaining secondary endpoints were not 
tested formally, but in an exploratory manner.
Finerenone had no effect on all-cause hospitalisation (HR = 0.97 [95% CI 0.90;1.04]; logrank test 
nominal p=0.3558) but had an effect on the component hospitalization due to heart failure (that was also 
the main contributor to the effect on the primary endpoint).
All-cause mortality was numerically reduced in the finerenone arm (HR = 0.89 [95% CI 0.77;1.04]; 
logrank test nominal p=0.1337).
Treatment with finerenone resulted in a reduced UACR from baseline to month 4 (ratio of LS-
means=0.676 [95% CI 0.650; 0.704]; nominal p-value of F-test <0.0001). Additional explorative long-
term data support a sustained suppression of UACR. Furthermore, the secondary 57% renal composite 
defined a more pronounced eGFR decrease that corresponds to a doubling of serum creatinine. Treatment 
with finerenone resulted in a 23% relative hazard reduction compared with placebo (HR 0.77 [95% CI 
0.60;0.99]; logrank test nominal p=0.0406) i.e. a similar risk reduction as seen in the previous FIDELIO-
DKD study, providing support for renoprotection.
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects
For the 40% and 57% renal endpoints, the treatment effect was reduced in subjects with ‘high’ 
albuminuria (<300 mg/g) compared to ‘very high’ albuminuria (>300 mg/g).  Data on UACR however 
suggest a similar and sustained response in both subgroups. Also, for the exploratory analysis of the 
chronic eGFR slope there was a positive effect on the slope in both subgroups compared to placebo, but 
the magnitude was reduced in patients in the “high” compared to the “very high” subgroup which may be 
expected given the lower progression rate of renal dysfunction in these patients. Thus, data suggest no 
treatment effect on renal clinical endpoints during the follow up time but the effect on GFR slope and 
UACR indicate a future beneficial effect not yet seen in clinical endpoints.
3.4.  Unfavourable effects
Kerendia is indicated for the treatment of CKD (stage 3 and 4 with albuminuria) associated with type 2 
diabetes in adults. The main evidence of efficacy submitted to support the indication was the FIDELIO-
DKD study in T2DM patients with CKD (mean eGFR 44 mL/min/1.73 m2) and albuminuria (mean UACR 
806 mg/g). 
The FIGARO-DKD study included T2DM patients with CKD (mean eGFR 68 mL/min/1.73 m2) and 
albuminuria (mean UACR 287 mg/g). The cumulative exposure was lower in FIDELIO-DKD compared with 
FIGARO-DKD, due to the overall shorter observation time in FIDELIO-DKD. Mean duration of exposure in 
FIGARO-DKD was about 35 months and in FIDELIO-DKD about 27.5 months.
The safety profile for finerenone in the FIGARO-DKD study was overall similar compared with previously 
identified adverse drug reactions for finerenone in the FIDELIO-DKD study, with hyperkalaemia as the 
main safety concern. The incidence of hyperkalaemia was two-fold increased for finerenone compared 
with placebo in FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD; although, the incidences overall were lower in the 
FIGARO-DKD with a population that had a better-preserved kidney function. The risk for hyperkalaemia 
increases with decreasing renal function. The risk for serious events of hyperkalaemia for Kerendia is 
handled with routine risk minimisation.
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023
Page 163/172
The safety result of FIGARO-DKD was presented individually followed by a summary of the pooled 
analysis of FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD. Similar safety data was overall seen from the pooled analysis 
of data from the FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD studies.
In FIGARO-DKD, the overall exposure was 17,149 PY for finerenone and 17,221 PY for placebo. Mean 
duration of exposure was about 35 months; 90% of the subjects were exposed for at least 52 weeks, 
81% for at least 2 years, 50% for at least 3 years and 22% for at least 4 years.
The number of TEAEs was balanced for finerenone (85.1%) and placebo (85.5%); however, the incidence 
of drug-related TEAEs was increased for finerenone (15.2%) compared with placebo (11.3%). Most of the 
TEAEs (about 67%) were mild or moderate in intensity. 
The incidence of serious TEAEs was slightly higher in the placebo group (33.2%) than in the finerenone 
group (31.4%). The number of fatal outcomes or adverse events was lower in the finerenone group 
(9.2%) compared with the placebo group (10.4%). 
Discontinuation rate due to TEAE was slightly higher for finerenone (5.6%) than for placebo (5.0%).  The 
most frequently reported TEAE leading to study drug discontinuation for finerenone vs placebo was 
hyperkalaemia (1.2% vs 0.4%). 
The incidence of hyperkalaemia was 2 times increased for finerenone versus placebo (10.8% vs 5.3%). 
Drug-related hyperkalaemia were reported in 6.5% of the subjects in the finerenone group compared 
with 3.1% in the placebo group. Serious events of hyperkalaemia were reported more frequently for 
finerenone (0.7%) than for placebo (0.1%). 
More subjects in the finerenone group (4.6%) reported ‘eGFR decreased’ compared with the placebo 
group (3.9%); however, renal events were more common for placebo (15.0%) than for finerenone 
(13.4%), of which the incidence of ‘acute kidney injury’ was balanced (2.5% vs 2.7%). The incidence of 
drug-related ‘acute kidney injury’ was increased for finerenone (0.5%) versus placebo (0.2%)
Laboratory findings, vital signs
A decrease in mean haematocrit (<0.85%) levels was observed in the first 4 months in the finerenone 
arm compared to placebo. 
The mean SBP in the finerenone arm was reduced by approximately 2-3 mmHg compared to placebo at 
month 1, and the reduction remained generally stable thereafter. The mean DBP in the finerenone arm 
was reduced by approximately 1-2 mmHg compared to placebo in the first 36 months.
Hypotension occurred more frequently in subjects in the finerenone group (4.2%) than in the placebo 
group (2.5%). 
The incidence of hyperuricaemia was increased for finerenone compared with placebo (4.5% vs 2.8%).  
Hyperuricaemia is now included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. No imbalances of gout (2.8% vs 2.5%), 
gouty arthritis (0.4% vs 0.5%) or nephrolithiasis (1.4% vs 1.5%) were identified
Subgroups
Integrated data from the FIDELIO-DKD and the FIGARO-DKD studies was provided for the subgroup 
analyses below:
Effect by age
The reporting rate was overall similar across the age groups. Slightly more SAEs were reported in the age 
group ≥75 years (36.0% vs 37.8%) compared to subjects 65-74 years (33.1% vs 34.0%) and <65 years 
(29.0% vs 32.1%); however, the incidence of SAEs was higher for placebo than for finerenone in all age 
Assessment report 
EMA/41550/2023
Page 164/172
groups. More subjects discontinued due to an AE in the finerenone group compared with placebo in the 
subgroups ≥75 years and 65-74 years.
Effect by sex
No notable differences between males and females were noted.
Effect by race
The incidence of AEs was about 82%-90% in White, Black and ‘Other subjects’ and was slightly higher in 
Asian subjects (93-94%). 
Effect by hepatic impairment
The incidence of subjects with any AE and any SAE, respectively, was slightly higher in subjects with 
hepatic impairment (AEs:90%; SAEs:38%-39%) compared to those without hepatic impairment in the 
medical history (AEs:85%-86%; SAEs:30%-33%), in both treatment groups. 
Effect by renal function
Subjects with lower eGFR at baseline reported overall more AEs and SAEs compared to subjects with 
higher eGFR at baseline although the incidences were balanced for finerenone and placebo, or higher for 
placebo, across the eGFR strata: eGFR 25 -<45 mL/min/1.73m2 (AEs:88.1% vs 88.4% and SAEs:33.7% 
vs 36.1%), eGFR 45 - <60 mL/min/1.73m2 (AEs:87.2% vs 87.3% and SAEs:33.2% and 35.3%) and 
eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73m2(AEs: 83.5% vs 84.0% and SAEs: 28.9% and 30.1%). However, the incidence 
of study-drug related AEs was increased for finerenone compared with placebo across the subgroups: 
eGFR 25 -<45 mL/min/1.73m2 (25.3% vs 17.4%), eGFR 45 - <60 mL/min/1.73m2 (18.4% vs 13.8%) and 
eGFR>60 mL/min/1.73m2 (12.7% vs 9.5%). 
The risk of hyperkalaemia increased with decreasing renal function across eGFR strata: ≥60 
mL/min/1.73m2 (7.6% vs 4.4%), 45 -<60 mL/min/1.73m2 (13.9% vs 6.2%) and 25-45 mL/min/1.73m2 
(21.6% vs 10.2%). 
Effect by albuminuria
In the FIGARO-DKD study, 46% of the subjects had high albuminuria at baseline (UACR 30 mg/g ≤300 
mg) and about 51% had very high albuminuria (UACR ≥300 mg/g). The incidences of drug-related AEs 
(high albuminuria: 19.0% vs 14.3%; very high albuminuria:11.4% vs 8.6%) and AEs leading to study 
drug discontinuation (high albuminuria: 7.7% vs 6.2%; very high albuminuria:3.7% vs 3.8%) were more 
increased in subjects with high albuminuria compared with subjects with very high albuminuria. The data 
is most likely driven by the worsening of kidney function rather than the degree of albuminuria. In the 
subgroup with UACR <300 mg/g, the majority of patients (66%) had a baseline eGFR <60 
mL/min/1.73m2; however, in the subgroup with UACR ≥300 mg/g, most subjects (88%) had a baseline 
eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects
In the FIGARO-DKD study, the incidences of drug-related AEs and AEs leading to study drug 
discontinuation were more increased in subjects with high albuminuria compared with subjects with very 
high albuminuria. The data was similar for the pooled analysis of data from FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-
DKD. This is explained by the fact that mean eGFR at baseline was higher in the subgroup of patients 
with baseline UACR ≥300 mg/g, as compared to those with UACR <300 mg/g.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects
CKD and T2D are each independently major global health concerns. An estimated 20 to 40% of T2D 
patients develop CKD, which is characterized by progressive damage and irreversible loss of function in 
the kidney eventually leading to kidney failure.
For the treatment of CKD and T2D, ACEis and ARBs constitute the current standard of care. SGLT2-
inhibitors, initially approved in 2013 for improving glycaemic control in T2D, have recently been shown to 
provide additional kidney and cardiovascular benefits in patients with CKD and T2D.
Finerenone was approved in 2022 for the treatment of patients with CKD stage 3 and 4 with albuminuria 
associated with type 2 diabetes in adults. The market authorisation was supported by the pivotal 
FIDELIO-DKD study that showed a 17.5% relative risk reduction compared with placebo for the composite 
endpoint of time to first occurrence of kidney failure, a sustained decrease of eGFR ≥40% from baseline

over at least 4 weeks, or renal death. The treatment effect was obtained on top of current standard of 
care (ACEi or ARB).
The current application for variation is based on efficacy data from the FIGARO-DKD study encompassing 
7334 patients with CKD and T2D treated with the individual maximum tolerated labelled dose of either an 
ACEI or an ARB. With the variation, the indication is proposed to be broadened to encompass all stages of 
CKD (with albuminuria) associated with type 2 diabetes (i.e. deletion of “stage 3 and 4” from the 
currently approved indication). Initially, the MAH also applied for the indication “prevention of 
cardiovascular (CV) events in adults with CKD”, but this request has subsequently been withdrawn.
In the FIGARO-DKD study, treatment with finerenone resulted in a 13% relative risk reduction compared 
with placebo for the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal 
stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure. Thus, a statistically significant effect has been shown in line 
with data from the previous FIDELIO-DKD study. The effect was driven by hospitalizations for heart 
failure but observed in a population without previous symptomatic heart failure (NYHA II-IV). There was 
no effect on nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke. The applicant proposed a reference to section 5.1 
with respect to “cardiovascular protection” but has agreed to change the reference to “renal and CV 
events” in order to align the SmPC with other recently approved products.
The key secondary renal endpoint intends to support a broadening of the indication to encompass all 
stages of CKD (with albuminuria) associated with type 2 diabetes (i.e. deletion of “stage 3 and 4” from 
the currently approved indication). Treatment with finerenone resulted in a 13% relative hazard reduction 
compared with placebo of the first secondary endpoint time to the first occurrence of onset of kidney 
failure, a sustained decrease of eGFR ≥40% from baseline over at least 4 weeks, or renal death.  The 
results did not reach statistical significance, but, in line with the CHMP’s opinion given in the SA, lack of 
statistical significance in the FIGARO results is not considered a main limiting factor to the pursued 
extension of indication, considering that a positive trend favouring finerenone over placebo has been 
demonstrated in the study population including Stage 1 and 2 of CKD. Data is thus in general in support 
for an effect across the different KDIGO categories, including CKD stage 1 and 2 for which extension of 
indication is sought.
However, for the key secondary renal endpoint, the treatment effect was reduced in subjects with ‘high’ 
albuminuria (HR=1.16 [95% CI 0.91; 1.47]) compared to ‘very high’ albuminuria (HR=0.74 [95% CI 
0.62; 0.90]). Data on change in UACR however suggest a similar and sustained response in both 
subgroups. Also, for the exploratory analysis of the chronic eGFR slope there was a positive effect on the 
slope in both subgroups compared to placebo, but the magnitude was reduced in patients in the “high” 
compared to the “very high” subgroup which may be expected given the lower progression rate of renal 
dysfunction in these patients. Thus, data suggest no treatment effect on the key secondary renal 
endpoint during the follow up time, but the effect on GFR slope and UACR indicate a future beneficial 
effect not yet seen in clinical endpoints. In addition, finerenone had a beneficial effect on the primary CV 
endpoint in the FIGARO-DKD study, regardless of baseline albuminuria status. Thus, the totality of data, 
including findings from post hoc analyses, support that patients with both “high” and “very high” 
albuminuria benefit from the treatment.
No new safety concerns arise from the data provided compared to what is previously known concerning 
the safety profile for finerenone. The main safety concern is hyperkalaemia that increases with decreasing 
renal function. SAEs of hyperkalaemia are reported more frequently for finerenone than for placebo and 
more subjects discontinued treatment due to hyperkalaemia in the finerenone group compared with the 
placebo group. The incidence of hyperkalaemia was two-fold increased for finerenone compared with 
placebo in the FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD studies, respectively; however, the incidences were overall 
lower in the FIGARO-DKD with a population that had a better-preserved kidney function. The risk of 
hyperkalaemia for Kerendia is handled with routine risk minimisation.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks
The primary CV endpoint from the FIGARO-DKD is in line with the CV findings from the previous FIDELIO-
DKD study and provides additional data for a population encompassing patients with CKD stage 1-2. The 
results for the key secondary renal endpoint were not significant, but in line with previous CHMP advice, 
lack of statistical significance is not considered a main limiting factor to the pursued extension of 
indication, considering that a positive trend favouring finerenone over placebo has been demonstrated in 
the study population including CKD stage 1-2. The response in the key secondary endpoint display 
heterogeneity concerning albuminuria while the beneficial CV effect was observed regardless of baseline 
albuminuria status. Patients with “high” albuminuria has a lower progression rate of renal dysfunction and 
explorative data suggest possible future beneficial renal effects not yet seen during the follow up time. 
Thus, the FIGARO-DKD study provides support for a positive B/R balance also for patients with CKD stage 
1-2 and it is not considered that the data support a restriction of the indication to patients with very high 
albuminuria (>300 mg/g). The benefit-risk balance is considered positive.
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance
Not applicable.
3.8.  Conclusions
The overall B/R of Kerendia is positive.

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 15 DECEMBER 2022
KERENDIA EMEA/H/C/005200/II/0001/G
The undersigned member of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending the 
variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation of Kerendia.
The reason for divergent opinion was the following:
The FIGARO study showed a benefit in the “very high” albuminuria” group but failed to convincingly 
demonstrate a benefit in the “high” albuminuria group as:
- the renal composite endpoints, which are recommended as primary outcomes in confirmatory trials by 
EMA guidelines, failed to show efficacy [HR=1.16 (95% CI 0.91; 1.47) in 40% renal composite].
-The chronic eGFR slope over a 36 month-follow-up period showed a difference from placebo which is 
below clinical relevance (between-treatment difference of 0.702 [95% CI 0.143;1.261]).
- the positive effect observed in the Urine Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (UACR) end-point alone is unable 
to support a benefit. This is supported by the dissociation between the trend in the composite renal 
endpoints and albuminuria changes over a 4-year follow-up period.
The lack of demonstrated efficacy, together with a slightly unfavorable renal safety profile in this sub-
group, does not allow to conclude on a positive B/R in patients with <300 mg/g albuminuria.

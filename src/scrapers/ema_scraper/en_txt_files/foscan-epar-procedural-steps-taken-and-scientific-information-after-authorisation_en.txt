on the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit risk balance,

the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of this medicinal product continues to be 
adequately and sufficiently demonstrated and therefore 
considered that the benefit risk profile of Foscan continues 
to be favourable. The CHMP recommends the renewal of 
the Marketing Authorisation with unlimited validity.

SmPC, Annex 
As part of the initial MA, the MAH had agreed to comply 
II, Labelling 
with the following two remaining Specific Obligations:  
and PL 
- To conduct a confirmatory study (TEM-HNC-001) of the 
palliative benefits of temoporfin in patients with advanced 
disease; 
- and to maintain a patient registry until the results of this 
confirmatory study have been submitted and reviewed by 
the CHMP. 
Study TEM-HNC-001 was a confirmatory multicentre, 
multinational, single-group, open-label, single-dose study. 
The primary objective was to assess overall tumour 
response in patients with advanced squamous cell 
carcinoma of the head and neck who have failed prior 
therapies and are unsuitable for curative therapy with 
radiotherapy, surgery or systemic therapy. The secondary 
objectives of the study were to assess complete tumour 
response; duration of tumour response; time to disease 
progression, quality of life, survival, Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status and weight, 
patient global assessment of treatment benefit, and the 
toxicity, tolerability and safety of Foscan-photodynamic 
therapy (PDT).

A total of 43 patients were enrolled in the study, 39 
patients were treated and analysed of which 19 achieved a 
complete response (CR) and 2 patients a partial response 
(PR), resulting in an overall response rate of 54% (95% CI: 
37%; 70%). Median progression free survival (PFS) for 
responding patients was 131 weeks while PFS was 31 
weeks for all patients studied. The estimated 40-week 
survival rate for responders was 91%, while this was 39% 
for the non-responders and 67% for the entire population 
studied. Furthermore, during the study, 20 patients (51%) 
maintained the same performance status, 15 patients 
(39%) had an improvement from ECOG 1 to 0 and 3 
patients (8%) experienced deterioration from ECOG 0 to 1. 
Response rates were observed to be higher and durations 
of response and survival were considerably longer in the 
present study than in the earlier performed study

Annex II 
Based on the provided information, the Benefit/Risk 
Foscan  
EMA/275247/2016 
assessment of Foscan remains unchanged. The Marketing 
Authorisation should be maintained under exceptional 
circumstances until the pending Specific Obligations are 
fulfilled. 
No relevant new safety data became available during the 
Page 6/10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
period under review. Based on the data provided, there is 
no need to update the SPC, labelling and Package Leaflet. 
The CHMP considered that there is no longer any need for 
the Marketing Authorisation Holder to provide yearly 
PSURs. The Committee considered that subsequent PSURs 
could be submitted every 3 years. 
R/0018 
Renewal of the marketing authorisation. 
21/09/2006 
29/11/2006 
SmPC, Annex 
Based upon the data that have become available since the 
II, Labelling 
granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP 
and PL 
considers that the benefit-risk balance of Foscan remains 
positive, but considers that its safety profile is to be closely 
monitored for the following reasons: 
Due to the limited patient exposure so far and the safety 
profile of Foscan which includes some serious side effects 
such as photosensitivity, all adverse reactions that will be 
reported, will need to be carefully considered. Therefore, 
the CHMP decided that the MAH should continue to submit 
yearly PSURs. Furthermore, Foscan remains under 
exceptional circumstances due to two unresolved specific 
obligations, which will generate further efficacy and safety 
data in the future.  The benefit-risk balance of the product 
will continue to be reviewed annually as part of the Annual 
Re-assessments.  
Therefore, based upon the safety profile of Foscan, which 
requires the submission of yearly PSURs, the CHMP 
concluded that the MAH should submit one additional 
renewal application in 5 years time. 
As part of the renewal procedure, the following statement 
was added to section 4.4 of the SPC and the PL has been 
updated accordingly: 
"For 6 months following Foscan treatment avoid prolonged 
Page 7/10

direct sunlight exposure of the injection site arm. As a 
precautionary measure, if prolonged outdoor activity is 
planned, the injection arm should be protected by wearing 
a long sleeved, coloured shirt." 
Changes were also made to the product information to 
bring it in line with the current EMEA/QRD template, SPC 
guideline and other relevant guideline(s), which were 
reviewed by QRD and accepted by the CHMP.

The CHMP, having reviewed the evidence of compliance 
with the Specific Obligations submitted and having re-
assessed the benefit/risk profile of the medicinal product, 
recommended that the Marketing Authorisation should 
remain under exceptional circumstances. 
The benefit/risk balance of Foscan remains unchanged. The 
MA should be maintained under exceptional circumstances 
until the pending specific obligations are fulfilled.

The CHMP, having reviewed the evidence of compliance

recommended that the Marketing Authorisation should

remain under exceptional circumstances.  
The MAH shall complete the following programme of studies 
within specified time frames, the results of which shall form 
the basis of the annual reassessments of the benefit/risk 
profile: 
- The MAH commits to conduct a study confirming the 
palliative benefits of Foscan PhotoDynamic Therapy (PDT) 
in patients with advanced disease; 
- The MAH commits to maintaining a register of patients 
treated with Foscan, until the results of the above-
mentioned confirmatory study are available and have been 
reviewed by the CHMP.

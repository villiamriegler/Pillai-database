Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
EndolucinBeta 
lutetium (177 Lu) chloride 
On 28 April 2016, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
EndolucinBeta, a radiopharmaceutical precursor. EndolucinBeta is not intended for direct use in patients 
and must be used only for radiolabelling carrier molecules specifically developed to be used with 
EndolucinBeta. The applicant for this medicinal product is ITG Isotope Technologies Garching GmbH. 
EndolucinBeta will be available as a solution of 3 - 150 GBq Lutetium (177Lu). The active substance of 
EndolucinBeta is lutetium (177Lu) chloride, a radioactive isotope of lutetium that emits beta and gamma 
radiation. The effect of EndolucinBeta will depend on the nature of the medicine that is radiolabelled with 
it. 
Since EndolucinBeta is only intended for administration after conjugation to carrier molecules, no clinical 
data with the use of EndolucinBeta alone have been submitted. However, the clinical utility of 
EndolucinBeta when attached to relevant carrier molecules has been demonstrated, for example, in the 
molecular imaging and treatment of neuroendocrine tumours. 
Unfavourable effects relating to radiation exposure of the patient and other individuals in close proximity 
can occur with EndolucinBeta, as is the case with all radionuclides in clinical use. These effects, which 
include carcinogenicity and mutagenicity, will depend on the radiation characteristics of lutetium (177Lu) 
chloride in EndolucinBeta and on the carrier molecule to which EndolucinBeta is labelled. A judgement on 
whether the risk is acceptable in any particular case can only be made in subsequent applications for 
carrier molecules intending to use EndolucinBeta as a radiolabel. 
The full indication is:  
"EndolucinBeta is a radiopharmaceutical precursor, and it is not intended for direct use in patients. It is to 
be used only for the radiolabelling of carrier molecules that have been specifically developed and 
authorised for radiolabelling with Lutetium (177Lu) chloride.”  
It is recommended that EndolucinBeta only be used by specialists experienced with in-vitro radiolabelling.

Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and 
made available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been 
granted by the European Commission.

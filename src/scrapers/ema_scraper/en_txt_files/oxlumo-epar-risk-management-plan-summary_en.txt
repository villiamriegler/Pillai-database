PART VI  SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for lumasiran.  The RMP details 
important risks of lumasiran, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will 
be obtained about lumasiran’s risks and uncertainties (ie, missing information). 
Lumasiran’s Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and its Package Leaflet (PL) give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how lumasiran should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for lumasiran should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of lumasiran’s 
RMP. 
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
I 
Lumasiran is authorized for treatment of Primary Hyperoxaluria 1 (PH1) in patients of all age 
groups.  It contains lumasiran as the active substance, and it is given by injection under the skin 
(subcutaneously (SC)). 
Further information about the evaluation of lumasiran’s benefits can be found in lumasiran’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines Agency 
website under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/oxlumo. 
II 
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES 
TO MINIMIZE OR FURTHER CHARACTERIZE THE RISKS 
Important risks of lumasiran, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about lumasiran’s risks are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
PL and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals. 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging. 
•  The medicine’s legal status; the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analyzed, including in the Periodic Safety Update Report assessment, so that immediate 
actions can be taken as necessary.  These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance 
activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of lumasiran is not yet available, it is listed 
under “missing information” (see Section II.A below). 
 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
II.A 
Important risks of lumasiran are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimize the risk so that the medicinal product can be safely administered.  
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of lumasiran.  Potential risks are concerns for 
which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation.  Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

Summary of Important Risks 
Important Identified Risk: None 
Important Potential Risk: Hepatic effects 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Lumasiran is directed for delivery to the liver, therefore adverse 
hepatic effects are possible.  Minor and reversible changes were 
noted in the non-clinical (animal) studies.  The relevance of these 
nonclinical findings to humans remains unclear. 
No clinically significant liver events or abnormal liver function 
tests indicative of hepatotoxicity (liver toxicity) have been 
observed, however, given the relatively small size of the safety 
database, potential effect of lumasiran on the liver has not been 
characterized.  Therefore, hepatic effects are included as an 
important potential risk to ensure further characterization of this 
potential safety concern.

Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan: Farydak 
(panobinostat) 
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  panobinostat.  The  RMP  details 
important risks of panobinostat, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information 
will be obtained about panobinostat risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Panobinostat summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how panobinostat should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for panobinostat should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of 
panobinostat RMP. 
Part VI: I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Panobinostat in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone, is indicated for the treatment 
of adult patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least 
two prior regimens including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory agent. 
Further information about the evaluation of panobinostat benefits can be found in panobinostat 
EPAR,  including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the 
medicine’s webpage link to the EPAR summary landing page on the EMA webpage.

Part VI: II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimize or further characterize the risks 
Important  risks  of  panobinostat,  together  with  measures  to  minimize  such  risks  and  the 
proposed studies for learning more about panobinostat risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with 
or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In the case of panobinostat, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimization 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly  analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
 
 
 
 
 
Part VI – II.A: List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of panobinostat are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of panobinostat. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to 
information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is  currently missing  and  needs  to  be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

Childbearing women, pregnant women and breastfeeding women. It is not 
known whether panobinostat is excreted in human milk. The risks to the fetus 
of inadvertent exposure may be considered to be greatest during the early 
gestation period.

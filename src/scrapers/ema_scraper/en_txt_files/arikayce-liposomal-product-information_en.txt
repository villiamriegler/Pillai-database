4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
ARIKAYCE liposomal is indicated for the treatment of non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) lung 
infections caused by Mycobacterium avium Complex (MAC) in adults with limited treatment options 
who do not have cystic fibrosis (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).  
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
ARIKAYCE liposomal treatment should be initiated and managed by physicians experienced in the 
treatment of non-tuberculous lung disease due to Mycobacterium avium Complex. 
ARIKAYCE liposomal should be used in conjunction with other antibacterial agents active against 
Mycobacterium avium Complex lung infections. 
Posology 
The recommended dose is one vial (590 mg) administered once daily, by oral inhalation.  
Duration of treatment 
Treatment with inhaled liposomal amikacin, as part of a combination antibacterial regimen, should be 
continued for 12 months after sputum culture conversion.  
Treatment with inhaled liposomal amikacin should not continue beyond a maximum of 6 months if 
sputum culture conversion (SCC) has not been confirmed by then. 
The maximum duration of treatment with inhaled liposomal amikacin should not exceed 18 months. 
Missed doses 
If a daily dose of amikacin is missed, the next dose should be administered the next day. A double 
dose should not be given to make up for the missed dose. 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required.

Hepatic impairment 
Inhaled liposomal amikacin has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. No dose 
adjustments based on hepatic impairment are required since amikacin is not hepatically metabolised. 
Renal impairment 
Inhaled liposomal amikacin has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. Use is 
contraindicated in severe renal impairment (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of inhaled liposomal amikacin in paediatric patients below 18 years of age 
have not been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Inhalation use 
Inhaled liposomal amikacin must only be used with the Lamira Nebuliser System (nebuliser handset, 
aerosol head and controller). For instructions for use, see section 6.6. It must not be administered by 
any other route or using any other type of inhalation delivery system. 
ARIKAYCE liposomal is administered only using a Lamira Nebuliser System. Like all other 
nebulised treatments, the amount delivered to the lungs will depend upon patient factors. Under 
recommended in vitro testing with the adult breathing pattern (500 mL tidal volume, 15 breaths per 
minute, and inhalation: exhalation ration of 1:1), the mean delivered dose from the mouthpiece was 
approximately 312 mg of amikacin (approximately 53% of label claim) with an average drug delivery 
rate of 22.3 mg/min assuming the nebulisation time of 14 minutes. The average mass median 
aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of the nebulised aerosol droplets is about 4.7 µm with D10 of 2.4 µm 
and D90 of 9.0 µm as determined using the next generation impactor method. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to any aminoglycoside antibacterial agent, or to any of the 
excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Hypersensitivity to soya. 
Co-administration with any aminoglycoside administered via any route of administration. 
Severe renal impairment. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity reactions 
Serious and potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been 
reported in patients taking inhaled liposomal amikacin. 
Before therapy with inhaled liposomal amikacin is instituted, an evaluation for previous 
hypersensitivity reactions to aminoglycosides should take place. If anaphylaxis or a hypersensitivity 
reaction occurs, inhaled liposomal amikacin should be discontinued and appropriate supportive 
measures should be instituted.

Allergic alveolitis 
Allergic alveolitis and pneumonitis have been reported with the use of inhaled liposomal amikacin in 
clinical studies (see section 4.8). 
If allergic alveolitis occurs, treatment with inhaled liposomal amikacin should be discontinued and 
patients should be treated as medically appropriate. 
Bronchospasm 
Bronchospasm has been reported with the use of inhaled liposomal amikacin in clinical studies. In 
patients with a history of reactive airway disease, asthma or bronchospasm, inhaled liposomal 
amikacin should be administered after using a short-acting bronchodilator. If there is evidence of 
bronchospasm due to inhaled liposomal amikacin inhalation, the patient may be pre-treated with 
bronchodilators (see section 4.8). 
Exacerbation of underlying pulmonary disease 
In clinical trials, exacerbation of underlying pulmonary disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, infective exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, infective exacerbation of 
bronchiectasis) was reported with a higher frequency in patients treated with inhaled liposomal 
amikacin compared with patients not receiving inhaled liposomal amikacin. Caution should be 
exercised when initiating inhaled liposomal amikacin in patients presenting with these underlying 
conditions. Discontinuation of treatment with inhaled liposomal amikacin should be considered if 
signs of exacerbation are observed. 
Ototoxicity 
In clinical trials, ototoxicity, (including deafness, dizziness, presyncope, tinnitus, and vertigo) was 
reported with a higher frequency in patients treated with inhaled liposomal amikacin compared with 
patients not receiving inhaled liposomal amikacin. Tinnitus was the most commonly reported 
ototoxicity related adverse reaction.  
Auditory and vestibular function should be monitored periodically in all patients and frequent 
monitoring is advised in patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction.  
If ototoxicity occurs during treatment, consideration should be given to discontinuing inhaled 
liposomal amikacin. 
There is an increased risk of ototoxicity in patients with mitochondrial DNA mutations (particularly 
the nucleotide 1555 A to G substitution in the 12S rRNA gene), even if aminoglycoside serum levels 
are within the recommended range during treatment. Alternative treatment options should be 
considered in such patients.  
In patients with a maternal history of relevant mutations or aminoglycoside induced deafness, 
alternative treatments or genetic testing prior to administration should be considered. 
Nephrotoxicity 
Nephrotoxicity was reported in clinical trials in patients treated with inhaled liposomal amikacin. 
Renal function should be monitored periodically during treatment in all patients and frequent 
monitoring is advised in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction.  
Consideration should be given to stopping inhaled liposomal amikacin in patients who develop 
evidence of nephrotoxicity on treatment.  
Use in patients with severe renal impairment is contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Neuromuscular blockade 
In clinical trials, neuromuscular disorders (reported as muscle weakness, neuropathy peripheral and 
balance disorder) have been reported with inhaled liposomal amikacin. Aminoglycosides may 
aggravate muscle weakness because of a curare-like effect at the neuromuscular junction. Use of 
inhaled liposomal amikacin in patients with myasthenia gravis is not recommended. Patients with any 
known or suspected neuromuscular disorders should be closely monitored. 
Co-administration with other medicinal products 
Co-administration of inhaled liposomal amikacin with other aminoglycosides is contraindicated (see 
section 4.3). 
Co-administration with any other medicinal product affecting auditory function, vestibular function or 
renal function (including diuretics) is not recommended. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No clinical drug interaction studies have been conducted with inhaled liposomal amikacin. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
Use of inhaled liposomal amikacin with any aminoglycoside administered by any route is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
Concurrent and/or sequential use of inhaled liposomal amikacin is not recommended with other 
medicinal products with neurotoxic, nephrotoxic or ototoxic potential that can enhance 
aminoglycoside toxicity (e.g. diuretic compounds such as ethacrynic acid, furosemide or intravenous 
mannitol) (see section 4.4). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of inhaled liposomal amikacin in pregnant women. Systemic exposure 
to amikacin following inhalation of inhaled liposomal amikacin is expected to be low compared to 
parenteral administration of amikacin.  
There are limited data from the use of aminoglycosides in pregnant women. Aminoglycosides can 
cause foetal harm. Aminoglycosides cross the placenta, and there have been reports of total, 
irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in children, whose mothers received streptomycin during 
pregnancy. Although adverse reactions on the foetus or newborns have not been reported in pregnant 
women treated with other aminoglycosides, the potential for harm exists. Animal reproductive toxicity 
studies have not been conducted with inhaled amikacin. In reproductive toxicity studies in mice, rats 
and rabbits with amikacin administered parenterally, no foetal malformations were reported. 
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of inhaled liposomal amikacin during 
pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
There is no information regarding the presence of amikacin in human milk. However, systemic 
exposure to inhaled liposomal amikacin following inhalation is expected to be low compared to 
parenteral administration of amikacin.  
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from inhaled 
liposomal amikacin therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the 
benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
No fertility studies were conducted with inhaled liposomal amikacin. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Amikacin has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. The administration of inhaled 
liposomal amikacin can cause dizziness and other vestibular disturbances (see section 4.8). Patients 
should be advised not to drive or operate machinery while using inhaled liposomal amikacin.

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Adverse reactions specifically associated with overdose of inhaled liposomal amikacin have not been 
identified in clinical trials. Overdose in subjects with pre-existing impaired renal function, deafness or 
vestibular disturbance, or impaired neuromuscular transmission may develop worsening of the pre-
existing disorder. 
In the event of an overdose inhaled liposomal amikacin should be stopped immediately. Where rapid 
removal of amikacin is indicated to prevent target organ damage, for example in subjects with renal 
impairment, peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis will accelerate the extraction of amikacin from blood.

5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antibacterials for systemic use, other aminoglycosides. ATC code: 
J01GB06 
Mechanism of action 
Amikacin binds to a specific receptor protein on the 30S subunit of bacterial ribosomes and interferes 
with an initiation complex between mRNA (messenger RNA) and the 30S subunit resulting in 
inhibition of protein synthesis. 
Resistance 
The mechanism of resistance to amikacin in mycobacteria has been linked to mutations in the rrs gene 
of the 16S rRNA. 
Clinical experience 
The efficacy of inhaled liposomal amikacin was evaluated in study INS-212, a randomised, open-label 
study in adult patients with non-tuberculous mycobacterial lung infections caused by MAC. 
Patients who had not achieved sputum culture conversion (SCC) while being treated with Multiple 
Drug Regimen(s) (MDR) for at least 6 months before study entry were randomised to receive 
ARIKAYCE in addition to their MDR treatment or to continue with MDR alone. Patients achieving 
SCC, defined as 3 consecutive negative MAC sputum cultures by month 6 on treatment continued 
therapy for up to 12 months after achieving SCC. Those not achieving SCC by month 6 were 
discontinued from the study at month 8.  
A total of 335 patients were randomised and dosed (ARIKAYCE liposomal + MDR n = 223; MDR 
alone n = 112) (Safety population). Median duration of prior MDR treatment was 2.6 years and 
2.4 years in the ARIKAYCE liposomal + MDR and MDR alone group, respectively. Patients were 
stratified per smoking status (current smoker or not) and MDR use at screening (on treatment or off 
treatment for at least 3 months prior to screening). The primary endpoint was durable SCC defined as 
the proportion of randomised patients that had achieved SCC by month 6 on treatment and had no 
positive solid media culture or no more than two broth media cultures by 3 months off treatment. 
Sixty-five (29.0%) and 10 (8.9%) patients achieved SCC by month 6 on treatment in the ARIKAYCE 
liposomal + MDR and the MDR group, respectively (p< 0.0001). Of these, based on the primary 
analysis durable SCC at 3 months off treatment was achieved by 16.1% [36/224] vs. 0% [0/112]; p-
value <0.0001.  
In a post-hoc analysis that eliminated patients with negative cultures (solid media or broth) at study 
baseline and which counted any post-treatment positive culture (solid media or broth) as positive, 
30/224 (13.4%) in the ARIKAYCE liposomal + MDR group and 0/112 (0%) in the MDR group 
achieved durable SCC at 3 months off treatment. Respective rates at 12 months off treatment were 
25/224 (11%) vs. 0/112 (0%). 
Paediatric population  
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
inhaled liposomal amikacin in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in NTM lung infection 
(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Sputum concentrations 
Following once daily inhalation of 590 mg inhaled liposomal amikacin in MAC patients, sputum 
concentrations at 1 to 4 hours post-inhalation were 1720, 884, and 1300 µg/g at 1, 3, and 6 months, 
respectively. High variability in amikacin concentrations was observed (CV% > 100%). After 
48 to 72 hours post-inhalation, amikacin sputum concentrations decreased to approximately 5% of 
those at 1 to 4 hours post-inhalation. 
Serum concentrations 
Following daily inhalation of 590 mg ARIKAYCE in MAC patients, at steady state, the median serum 
AUC0-24 was 16.7 µg *hr/mL (range: 4.31 to 55.6 µg *hr/mL; n = 53) and the median serum Cmax was 
1.81 µg/mL (range: 0.482 to 6.87 μg/mL; n = 53). 
Distribution 
Amikacin is ≤ 10% bound to serum proteins. The mean total apparent volume of distribution has been 
estimated to be approximately 5.0 L/kg. 
Biotransformation 
Amikacin is not metabolised. 
Elimination 
Amikacin is excreted in the urine unchanged, primarily by glomerular filtration. The median apparent 
terminal serum half-life of amikacin after inhalation of ARIKAYCE liposomal ranged from 
approximately 3.29 to 14.0 hrs. 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis for ARIKAYCE liposomal in 53 subjects with NTM lung 
disease aged 20 to 84 years indicated that amikacin clearance is 34 L/h. The only clinical covariate 
identified to be predictive of amikacin clearance was body weight. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Carcinogenicity 
In a 2-year inhalation carcinogenicity study with inhaled liposomal amikacin in rats at doses of 5, 15, 
and 45 mg/kg/day, squamous cell carcinoma was observed in the lungs of 2 of 120 rats (0/60 males 
and 2/60 females) administered the highest dose tested (45 mg/kg/day). This ARIKAYCE dose was 
6-fold greater than the clinical dose when normalised on a lung weight basis. No squamous cell 
carcinoma was observed at the mid-dose of 15 mg/kg/day, which was 2-fold greater than the clinical 
dose when normalised on a lung weight basis. The squamous cell carcinomas may be the result of a 
high lung burden of particulates from inhaled liposomal amikacin in the rat lung. The relevance of the 
lung tumour findings with regards to humans receiving inhaled liposomal amikacin is unknown. In 
dogs administered inhaled liposomal amikacin daily by inhalation for 9 months at doses up to 
30 mg/kg/day, no preneoplastic or neoplastic changes were observed in the lungs (approximately 
3 to 11 times the recommended human dose based on lung weight). 
Genotoxicity 
No evidence of mutagenicity or genotoxicity was observed in a battery of in vitro and in vivo 
genotoxicity studies with liposomal amikacin formulations (in vitro microbial mutagenesis test, in 
vitro mouse lymphoma mutation assay, in vitro chromosomal aberration study, and an in vivo 
micronucleus study in rats). 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reproductive and development toxicity 
Animal reproductive toxicology studies have not been conducted with inhaled amikacin. In non-GLP 
reproduction toxicology studies in mice and rats with parenterally administered amikacin, no effect of 
fertility or foetal toxicity was reported.

Instructions for use 
1.  What ARIKAYCE liposomal is and what it is used for 
ARIKAYCE liposomal is an antibiotic that contains the active ingredient amikacin. Amikacin 
belongs to a group of antibiotics called aminoglycosides which stop the growth of certain bacteria that 
cause infections. 
ARIKAYCE liposomal is used by inhalation to treat lung infection caused by Mycobacterium avium 
Complex in adults with limited treatment options who do not have cystic fibrosis. 
2.  What you need to know before you use ARIKAYCE liposomal 
Do not use ARIKAYCE liposomal 
- 
if you are allergic to amikacin or other aminoglycosides, soya or any of the other ingredients 
of this medicine (listed in section 6) 
if you are taking any other aminoglycosides (oral or for injection) 
if you have very poor kidney function 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using ARIKAYCE liposomal if: 
- 
you use a bronchodilator (“reliever”) for breathing problems, as you will be asked to use that 
first, before using ARIKAYCE liposomal; 
you have kidney problems; you may need to have a kidney test before starting treatment; 
you have hearing difficulties, ringing or buzzing in the ears (tinnitus) or balance problems 
including spinning sensation, lack of coordinated muscle movements, dizziness or light-
headedness. You may have to have a hearing test before starting or during treatment, if you have 
any hearing problems; 
you suffer from other lung diseases;  
you have a disease that causes muscle weakness and fatigue, such as myasthenia gravis; 
you have, or have a maternal history of mitochondrial mutation disease (a genetic condition) or 
loss of hearing due to antibiotic medicines, you are advised to inform your doctor or pharmacist 
before you take an aminoglycoside; certain mitochondrial mutations may increase your risk of

Instructions for use 
ARIKAYCE liposomal is for oral inhalation use with the Lamira Nebuliser System. 
Before using your Lamira Nebuliser System, be sure you read and understand the detailed 
information in the full Instructions for Use that come with the Lamira Nebuliser System. These 
will provide more complete information about how to put together (assemble), prepare, use, clean, 
and disinfect your Lamira Nebuliser System.  
Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them well. 
Assemble the handset including the connection to the controller as illustrated in the full Instructions 
for Use. 
Preparing the medicine for use: 
1.  
It is recommended that the vial be removed from the refrigerator at least 45 minutes before use 
to allow it to come to room temperature. Do not use other medicines in the Lamira Nebuliser 
Handset. 
2.  
Shake the ARIKAYCE liposomal vial vigorously, until the medicine looks the same throughout 
and well mixed. 
3.  
Lift orange cap from vial and put aside (Figure 1).

ANNEX IV 
SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR THE VARIATION TO THE TERMS

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for amikacin (centrally 
authorised product only), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data from literature on the increased risk of ototoxicity in patients with particular 
mitochondrial rRNA mutations and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers 
a causal relationship between amikacin (centrally authorised product only) and increased risk of 
aminoglycoside-associated ototoxicity in patients with mitochondrial mutations at least a reasonable 
possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing amikacin 
(centrally authorised product only) should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for amikacin (centrally authorised product only) the 
CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing amikacin 
(centrally authorised product only) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product 
information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied.

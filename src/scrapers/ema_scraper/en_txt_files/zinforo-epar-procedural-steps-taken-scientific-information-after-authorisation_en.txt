add corresponding wording describing these ADRs in 
section 4.8 of the Zinforo (ceftaroline fosamil), as a

common adverse reactions occurring in ≥3% of patients 
treated with Zinforo were nausea, headache, and rash. The 
safety profile of Zinforo was similar to that observed in 
previous pooled Phase III studies with the exception of a 
greater incidence of rash in Asian patients.

as an uncommon adverse reaction within the Blood and 
lymphatic system disorders SOC. It is therefore considered 
plausible that this listed effect could also be associated 
with, or inclusive of, neutropenia. Furthermore, a number 
of other drugs within the cephalosporin class already list 
neutropenia in their product information along with 
leukopenia. 
The majority of the reports which the MAH presented from 
its search of the SAPPHIRE database for the ADR 
neutropenia reported the presence of concomitant 
medications which were known to be associated with blood 
dyscrasias such as leukopenia and neutropenia. However, 
without details of the action taken with these concomitant 
medications it is difficult to assess the impact these had on 
causality. There was evidence provided by the MAH from 
these reports of positive de-challenges, including recovery 
without treatment and reasonable onset times, which is 
supportive of an association between ceftaroline and 
Page 15/20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
neutropenia. 
The proposal to include neutropenia in the product 
information was therfore considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. This alone does not change the benefit-risk balance 
for the product, which remains positive.

that the doses used achieved ceftaroline exposures in the

>1 mg/L in plasma samples collected 3 to 4 hours after the 
end of the ceftaroline fosamil infusion in all subjects and in 
plasma samples collected 5 to 7 hours after the end of 
infusion in the majority of subjects. The mean ceftaroline 
concentrations in the plasma samples taken at the end of 
the infusion were lower in the youngest subjects (preterm

ceftaroline was cleared more slowly by the youngest 
subjects. There were no deaths and no subjects 
discontinued from the study due to an adverse event. The 
most common TEAEs overall were alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) increased, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
increased, blood creatine phosphokinase (CPK) increased, 
blood lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) increased, prothrombin

The elimination half-life in healthy Caucasian/non-Asian

healthy Chinese adults is similar. The mean steady-state 
volume of distribution of ceftaroline in healthy 
Caucasian/non-Asian adults following a single 600 mg

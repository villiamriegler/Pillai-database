The SmPC of Opzelura was updated based on TRuE-V LTE, 
based on final results from study INCB 18424-308; a 
Phase III, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, 
randomised withdrawal and treatment-extension 
study to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of 
ruxolitinib cream in participants with vitiligo (TRuE-V 
a phase 3, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, randomised 
withdrawal and treatment-extension study of ruxolitinib 
cream which enrolled 458 eligible patients with vitiligo who 
had completed either of the parent studies using ruxolitinib 
(TRuE-V1 and TRuE-V2). SmPC section 4.2 is updated to 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

indicate that once satisfactory repigmentation is achieved, 
treatment in those areas can be stopped, and that if 
depigmentation recurs after treatment discontinuation, 
therapy can be reinitiated on the affected areas. SmPC 
section 5.1 is updated with efficacy information based on 2-
year results of the TRuE-V LTE study, eligible patients 
(n=458) with vitiligo who had completed either of the 
parent studies were assigned to either cohort A (n=116) or 
B (n=342). In cohort A (patients who who reached ≥ F-
VASI90 at week 52 of the parent study), a relapse occurred 
in 15% of patients in the ruxolitinib group and in 29% of 
patients in the vehicle group. In the latter group, the 
majority of relapses occurred during the first 4 months 
after stopping ruxolitinib cream; re-treatment resulted in 
regained F-VASI75 in 75% patients in a median of 12 
weeks and F-VASI90 was regained by 69% patients in a 
median of 15 weeks. In cohort B (patients who reached < 
F-VASI90 at week 52 of the parent study), among patients 
originally randomised to ruxolitinib cream, 66% reached F-
VASI75, and 34% reached F-VASI90. No new safety 
concerns were identified in the long-term extension study 
up to 2 years.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Zinforo  (ceftaroline  fosamil)  is  an  oxyimino  cephalosporin  antibacterial  agent  for  intravenous 
administration,  presented  for  clinical  use  as  the  more  water  soluble  N-phosphono  (fosamil),  which  is 
rapidly converted to ceftaroline by phosphatases in human plasma.  
It  was  approved  in  the  EU  in  August  2012  for  treatment  of  adults  with  complicated  skin  and  soft  tissue 
infections (cSSTI) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The recommended adult dosing regimen is 
600  mg  (reduced  to  400  mg  for  patients  with  creatinine  clearance  [CrCL]  >30  to  ≤ 50  mL/min) 
administered as a 60-minute infusion every 12 hours (q12h) for 5 to 14 days for cSSTI and 5 to 7 days 
for  CAP.  In  2014  a  Type  II  variation  added  dosage  adjustment  recommendations  for  adults  with  severe 
renal impairment (CrCL ≤ 30 mL/min) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD; CrCL <15 mL/min), including 
patients undergoing haemodialysis. 
The  main  purpose  of  this  extension  of  indication  application  is  to  extend  the  use  of  Zinforo  to  children 
aged from 2 months to 17 years based on submission of the CSRs for the following studies, which were 
conducted in children (aged from 2 months to less than 18 years), in accordance with the agreed PIP: 
•  D3720c00004 (P903-23) A multicentre, randomized, observer-blinded, active-controlled study 
to  evaluate  the  safety,  tolerability,  efficacy,  and  pharmacokinetics  of  ceftaroline  versus 
comparator in paediatric subjects with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections 
•  D3720c00007 (P903-31) A multicentre, randomized, observer blinded, active-controlled study 
evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of ceftaroline versus ceftriaxone 
in paediatric subjects with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia requiring hospitalization 
•  D3720c00013 (P903-24) A multicentre, randomized, observer-blinded, active-controlled study 
evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of ceftaroline versus ceftriaxone 
plus vancomycin in paediatric subjects with complicated community-acquired bacterial pneumonia 
The initial proposals for doses in children ages > 2 months and adolescents < 18 years were as follows:

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Additional toxicity studies using ceftaroline fosamil were conducted in juvenile rats to support this 
submission as follows:   
The MAH also updated the in-vitro susceptibility data. 
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
The  in  vitro  activity  of  ceftaroline  has  been  reported  against  clinically  important  community-acquired 
pneumonia  (CAP)  and  complicated  skin  and  soft  tissue  (cSSTI)  pathogens,  relevant  to  the  Zinforo 
prescribing information. 
Ceftaroline  activity  was  assessed  against  Gram-positive  and  Gram-negative  bacteria  isolated  from  adult 
and  paediatric  infected  patients.  Overall,  susceptibility  to  ceftaroline  was  similar  between  isolates  from 
paediatric  and  adult  age  groups  for  the  relevant  pathogens  causing  skin  and  respiratory  infections. 
However,  susceptibility  varied  ±1  doubling  dilution  in  the  MIC90  values  for  S. aureus  (MRSA)  depending 
on the geographic region. MRSA isolates from children were generally more susceptible to ceftaroline than 
adult isolates by one doubling dilution. 
The 
fastidious  Gram-positive  (S.  pneumoniae,  β-haemolytic  streptococci)  and  Gram-negative 
(Haemophilus species) isolates obtained from both age groups were highly susceptible to ceftaroline when 
assessed using established interpretative criteria on susceptibility.  
Against  Enterobacteriaceae  ceftaroline  is  active  only  against  non-ESBL-producing  strains.  Isolates  from 
adult and paediatric patients showed comparable susceptibilities across different geographic regions. 
The  MAH  concluded  that  ceftaroline  is  equally  active  against  adult  and  paediatric  isolates  that  are 
clinically important in the two indicated infection types. CHMP agreed to this conclusion. 
2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  originally  intended  doses  of  ceftaroline  fosamil  proposed  by  the  MAH  in  paediatric  patients  with 
normal  renal  function  and  mild  renal  impairment  are  12  mg/kg  (up  to  a  maximum  dose  of  400  mg) 
administered every 8 hours as a 1 hour infusion to paediatric patients ≥2 years and 8 mg/kg ceftaroline 
fosamil every 8 hours as a 1 hour infusion in children 2 months to <2 years.  
Ceftaroline  fosamil  was  given  to  male  and  female  neonatal  rats  by  slow  intravenous  bolus  dose  for  14 
days from PND 7 to 21. Ceftaroline fosamil was well tolerated, no new target organs were identified and 
the NOAEL was the highest dose tested (270 mg/kg).

Page 8/53 
 
  
  
 
Exposure levels (AUC(0-t)) of ceftaroline tested in the juvenile rat at 270 mg/kg/day were approximately 
2  to  3-fold  higher  than  the  predicted  median  steady  state  AUC(0-24)  values  of  ceftaroline  (based  on 
simulations) in patients with mild renal impairment.  
The  maximum  plasma  levels  of  ceftaroline  tested  in  the  juvenile  rat  at  270  mg/kg/day  were 
approximately  20  to  28-fold  higher  than  the  predicted  median  steady  state  Cmax  values  of  ceftaroline 
(based on simulations) in patients with mild renal impairment.  
2.2.4.  Toxicology 
Other toxicity studies 
Ceftaroline  Fosamil:  14  day  intravenous  dose  range  finding  toxicity  study  in  the  neonatal  rat  (study 
number: 20011802 (3011LR)).  
Ceftaroline fosamil was administered once daily to neonatal Sprague-Dawley rat pups (Crl:CD[SD]) from 
Post  Natal  Day  (PND)  7  to  21  via  an  intravenous  (bolus)  injection  (lateral  tail  vein)  at  0,  30,  90 or  270 
mg/kg to groups of 4 males and 4 females (main study) and 24 males and 24 females (toxicokinetic [TK] 
study)  (20011802  (3011LR)).  Controls  were  given  39.5  mg/mL  of  L-Arginine  in  0.9%  (w/v)  Sodium 
Chloride for Injection. Dams were not given the test or control articles. Clinical signs, body weights, body 
weight changes, urine analysis, toxicokinetic parameters (ceftaroline ceftaroline fosamil, or ceftaroline M-
1 metabolite [primary inactive metabolite]), organ weights, and gross and microscopic observations were 
measured/conducted.  
There  were  no  test  article-related  clinical  signs,  however  injection  site  reactions  occurred  at  all  doses, 
including  controls.  Body  weights  and  body  weight  gains  were  not  affected  at  any  dose.  Urine  analysis 
parameters  were  comparable  among  the  doses.  There  were  no  test  article-related  gross  lesions  or 
microscopic  findings,  or  any  changes  in  organ  weights  at  any  dose  that  were  considered  related  to 
ceftaroline fosamil (brain, paired kidneys and spleen).

Table 2 Summary of TK Results in Combined Male and Female 
Ceftaroline Fosamil: 14 day intravenous toxicity study in the neonatal rats with a 4-week recovery period 
(20011803 (3012LR)).  
Ceftaroline fosamil was given once daily to neonatal Sprague-Dawley (Crl:CD[SD]) rat pups from PND 7 
to 21 via an intravenous (bolus) injection (lateral tail vein) at 30, 90 or 270 mg/kg to groups of 20 males 
and  20  females  (main  and  recovery  study)  and  36  males  and  36  females  (toxicokinetic  [TK]  study) 
(20011803 (3012LR)). Controls were given 35.5 mg/mL of L-arginine in 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride for 
injection.  
Dams  were  not  dosed  during  this  study,  clinical  signs,  body  weight,  body  weight  changes,  functional 
observational  battery  (FOB),  urine  analysis,  haematology,  clinical  chemistry,  organ  weights,  and  gross 
and microscopic observations were investigated.  
There were no test article-related deaths during this study. Morbidity and/or mortality occurred in 7 rats 
(3 main and 4 satellites). The premature decedents occurred in the control group and at 30 and 90 mg/kg 
(2, 3 and 2 rats respectively). In these seven animals, four were related to an injury (i.e., broken limb at 
30 mg/kg, laceration on the chest at 30 mg/kg, laceration on the back at 0 mg/kg, or desheathing of the 
tail at 90 mg/kg), one was considered secondary to the intravenous dosing procedure (i.e., an embolism 
in  the  lungs),  and  two  (one  at  0  mg/kg  and  one  at  30  mg/kg)  had  no  known  cause  of  death.  All  other 
animals  survived  to  scheduled  euthanasia  on  PND  22  (end  of  dose  period)  or  PND  50  (end  of  recovery 
period). 
Injection  site  reactions  (swelling,  discoloration  or  ulceration)  were  seen  at  all  doses,  including  the 
controls; however, these injection site reactions were attributed to the route of administration. At the end 
of the dosing and recovery periods, body weight gains in both sexes were comparable with controls.  
There  were  no  test  article-related  effects  on  clinical  pathology  parameters  (haematology  and  urine 
analysis) at the end of the dosing or recovery periods. There were no test article-related effects on organ 
weights (brain, paired kidneys and spleen) at the end of the dosing and recovery periods.  There was an 
equivocal  test  article-related  increase  in  the  incidence  of  cysts/pitted  surfaces  of  the  kidneys  in  both 
sexes at PND 50.  
Cysts were lined by a single layer of epithelium with a lumen size at least the diameter of two tubules in 
the region and involved a small area of the kidney. Minimal fibrosis occasionally encircled the cysts and, 
because of its focal nature, was considered not to be of toxicological concern.

Table 3 Summary of Microscopic Findings (PND 22) 
Microscopic findings in the kidney, observed at the end of the recovery period (PND 50), were similar in 
appearance to those observed at PND 22 (i.e., renal cyst with occasional minimal fibrosis). 
Table 4 Summary of Microscopic Findings (PND 50) 
An  increased  macroscopic  incidence of  kidneys  with  cysts  or pitted  surfaces  was  observed  at the  end of 
the  recovery  period  (PND  50)  in  both  sexes  at  all  doses  (when  compared  to  published  background 
macroscopic and microscopic renal findings in Sprague-Dawley rats).  
The MAH stated that as microscopic assessment is considered to provide a more accurate assessment of 
cyst  incidence  and  relationship  to  test  article  administration,  the  microscopic  findings  more  accurately 
reflected the true incidence of this finding.  
Microscopically, an increased and variable incidence of renal cysts was present at all doses at PND 22 and 
PND 55 in rats, including controls (Owen et al 1986) The incidence was also increased when compared to 
a recent histological review of renal cysts in 45 day old control Sprague Dawley rats (McKay 2012) which 
revealed  an  overall  incidence  of  renal  cysts  of  less  than  10%.  This  observation  may  suggest  a  possible 
procedural-related  effect  in  the  current  study.  This  is  supported  by  current  literature  in  which  it  is 
suggested  that  glucocorticoids  play  a  key  role  in  nephrogenesis  in  young  rodents  and  that  excess 
corticosteroids  can  potentially  lead  to  cystogenesis  (McDonald  et  al.,  2011,  Gupta  et  al.,  2001,  Chan  et 
al., 2010).  
The  juvenile  rats  in  this  study  were  being  dosed  during  a  time  period  which  coincides  with  active 
nephrogenesis  (PND  1  to  PND  11)  (Zoetis  et  al.,  2003)  and  so  a  potential  stress-associated  effect  on 
tubule development, secondary to the intravenous dosing procedure should be considered. An additional 
consideration is that all animals received a high volume daily bolus injection of ceftaroline fosamil or the 
control article. This could also cause altered electrolyte and fluid homeostasis in the kidney and contribute 
to  renal  tubule  dilatation  and  cyst  formation.  This  phenomenon  has  been  described  in  the  beagle  dog 
following administration of high oral doses of potent diuretics. 
This finding did not fully correlate with the microscopic findings as cysts were also identified histologically 
in  control  rats.    The  MAH  explained  that  as  these  findings  involved  only  a  small  portion  of  the  kidney, 
were  present  in  control,  and  occurred  in  the  absence  of  significant  changes  in  renal  function  or  urinary 
parameters, they were considered not to be adverse. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/244427/2016 
Page 11/53 
 
  
  
 
 
 
At the end of the recovery period (PND 50) there was an increase in the incidence of cysts at all doses in 
males  and  at  270  mg/kg/day  in  females.  This  was  accompanied  by  an  increased  incidence  of  pericystic 
fibrosis at 90 and 270 mg/kg/day (both sexes). 
When the males were evaluated on PND 50, the maximum and average values recorded in the forelimb 
grip  test  were  decreased  at  270  mg/kg.  Conversely,  in  females,  increased  maximum  (p≤0.05)  and 
average values were recorded in the fore- and hind limb grip tests in this same dose group on PND 50. 
The differences observed in these tests were considered incidental, and not related to the test article as: 
1)  alterations  in  movement  were  not  observed  in  these  rats;  and  2)  opposing  observations  occurred  in 
males (i.e., decrease in grip strength) and females (i.e., increase in grip strength). There were no other 
test article-related effects on neurobehavioral endpoints. 
A significant elevation (p ≤ 0.05) of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was observed on PND 22 in males at 270 
mg/kg.  As  individual  variation  was  large  and  there  was  no  correlation  of  higher  values  with  cyst 
occurrence,  this  was  considered  not to  be  of  toxicological  significance.  There  were  no  other  test  article-
related effects on clinical chemistry endpoints. 
The  No  Observed  Adverse  Effect  Level  (NOAEL)  was  considered  to  be  270  mg/kg  in  juvenile,  suckling 
rats.

2.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  updated  data  submitted  in  this  application  do  not  lead  to  a  significant  increase  in  environmental 
exposure further to the use of Zinforo.  
Considering the above data, CHMP agreed that Zinforo is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Assessment of paediatric data on non-clinical aspects 
Exposure levels (AUC(0-t)) of ceftaroline tested in the juvenile rat at 270 mg/kg/day were approximately 
2  to  3-fold  higher  than  the  predicted  median  steady  state  AUC(0-24)  values  of  ceftaroline  (based  on

simulations) in paediatric patients with mild renal impairment. The maximum plasma levels of ceftaroline 
tested in the juvenile rat at 270 mg/kg/day were approximately 20 to 28-fold higher than the predicted 
median  steady  state  Cmax  values  of  ceftaroline  (based  on  simulations)  in  paediatric  patients  with  mild 
renal impairment.

To describe the juvenile toxicity data, CHMP asked the MAH to include the following wording in section 5.3 
of the Zinforo SmPC:   
Juvenile toxicity Intravenous bolus dosing of ceftaroline fosamil to suckling rats from post-natal day 7 to 
20 was well tolerated at plasma exposures approximately 2-fold higher than those for paediatric patients. 
Renal cortical cysts were observed in all groups, including controls, on PND50. The cysts involved a small 
portion of the kidney and occurred in the absence of significant changes in either renal function or urinary 
parameters. Therefore, these findings were not considered to be adverse.  
2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Two  juvenile  toxicity  rat  studies  were  conducted  in  support  of  the  use  of  Zinforo  in  paediatric  patients 
aged  from  2  months  to  <18  years  with  CAP  or  cSSTI.    In  the  non-GLP  dose  range  finding  study 
ceftaroline fosamil was given once daily to neonatal Sprague-Dawley rat pups from Post Natal Day (PND) 
7  to  21  via  an  intravenous  (bolus)  injection  (lateral  tail  vein)  at  0,  30,  90  or  270  mg/kg.  In  this  study 
ceftaroline fosamil was well tolerated and did not result in any mortality or clinical signs. There were no 
apparent changes in body weight, body weight gains, organ weights (brain, paired kidneys and spleen) or 
urine analysis parameters. There were no gross and microscopic finding considered related to ceftaroline 
fosamil at any dose.  
Ceftaroline fosamil was given once daily to neonatal Sprague-Dawley (Crl:CD[SD]) rat pups from PND 7 
to 21 via an intravenous (bolus) injection (lateral tail vein) at 30, 90 or 270 mg/kg (GLP study). Transient 
reductions  in  body  weight  gains  occurred  in  both  sexes  at  all  doses  at  the  start  of  the  dosing  period; 
however, these reductions did not persist. At the end of study, there were no relevant test article-related 
effects on clinical signs, body weight, neurobehavioral parameters, clinical pathology parameters or organ 
weights. 
Exposure levels (AUC0-t) of ceftaroline tested in the juvenile rat at 270 mg/kg/day were approximately 2 
to  3-fold  higher  than  the  predicted  median  steady  state  AUC(0-24)  values  of  ceftaroline  (based  on 
simulations) in paediatric patients with mild renal impairment. The maximum plasma levels of ceftaroline 
tested in the juvenile rat at 270 mg/kg/day were approximately 20 to 28-fold higher than the predicted 
median  steady  state  Cmax  values  of  ceftaroline  (based  on  simulations).  Exposures  at  30  and  90 
mg/kg/day were at or below the predicted clinical exposures. 
There were observations of microscopic renal cysts in male rats at 90 mg/kg (PND 22) and in both sexes 
at  (PND  55)  there  were  considered  possibly  test  article-related,  but  not  adverse,  due  to  the  small  area 
involved,  presence  in  control,  normal  morphology  of  the  overall  kidney,  and  lack  of  changes  in  renal 
function  or  urine  parameters.  Based  on  the  results of  this  study,  270  mg/kg is  considered to be  the  No 
Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/244427/2016 
Page 14/53 
 
  
  
However at the end of the recovery period (PND 50) there was an increase in the incidence of cysts at all 
doses  in  males  and  at  270  mg/kg/day  in  females.  This  was  accompanied  by  an  increased  incidence  of 
pericystic  fibrosis  at  90  and  270  mg/kg/day  (both  sexes).  This  could  indicate  a  progression  of  these 
effects, which were not present in the controls and therefore cannot be attributed to procedural factors. 
Considering that the kidney has been identified as the primary target organ of toxicity in adult rats and 
monkeys, and that the extension of the indication sought includes very young children (from 2 months of 
age), the MAH was asked to provide a more extensive discussion concerning the renal findings in juvenile 
rats, to justify the conclusion that these findings are not adverse. 
The MAH responded to this issue and clarified that overall, as the cysts involved only a small area of the 
kidney  and  the  fibrosis  was  focal  and  minimal  in  nature  and  both  occurred  in  the  absence  of  significant 
changes  in  renal  function  or  urinary  parameters,  did  not  appear  to  have  any  significant  implications  for 
the  animals  (no  adverse  clinical  signs,  only  transient  effects  on  body  weight  gain  and  no  significant 
changes  in  clinical  pathology  or  organ  weights)  they  are  considered  not  to  be  adverse.  Based  on  the 
above  analysis  the  MAH’s  proposal  for  the  additional  text  in  Section  5.3  of  the  SmPC  was  accepted  by 
CHMP. 
The  updated  data  submitted  in  this  application  do  not  lead  to  a  significant  increase  in  environmental 
exposure further to the use of Zinforo. Considering the available data, Zinforo is not expected to pose a 
risk to the environment.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Special populations 
The details of the two prior PK studies in patients aged < 18 years are provided, so that all the relevant 
data are made available for review. 
Previously reported studies: 
P903-15 was included in the initial application dossier for ceftaroline even though use below 18 years of 
age was not sought at that time. This study planned to evaluate safety and PK in patients aged from 12 
to  17  years  who  were  to  receive  a  single  dose  of  8  mg/kg  if  <  75  kg  or  600  mg  if  ≥75  kg  while  being 
hospitalised and treated with licensed antibacterial agents for infections of any type.  
P903-21  was  submitted  and  assessed  as  part  of  variation  II/08  in  2013,  which  did  not  lead  to  any 
changes  in  the  Zinforo  SmPC.  The  study  evaluated  the  pharmacokinetics  and  safety  of  a  single  dose  of 
ceftaroline  in  children  from  birth  to  <  12  years  of  age.  This  was  an  open-label,  sequential,  single  dose 
study  in  children  while  being  hospitalised  and  treated  with  licensed  antibacterial  agents  for  infections  of 
any type. The study enrolled 5 cohorts who were dosed as follows: 
o  Cohort 1 - 6 to <12 years (n=10); 10 mg/kg (max 600 mg) as a 1 hour infusion 
o  Cohort 2 - 2 to <6 years (n=8); 15 mg/kg as a 1.5 hour infusion 
o  Cohort 3 - 28 days to <2 years with equal numbers < or > 12 months (n=12); 12 mg/kg as a 1 
hour infusion if ≥5 months and 8 mg/kg as a 1 hour infusion if ≥28 days to <5 months 
o  Cohort  4  -  full-term  neonates  aged  <28  days  with  equal  numbers  <  or  >  14  days  (n=12);  8 
mg/kg as a 1 hour infusion 
o  Cohort 5 - preterm neonates (gestational age 32 to 37 weeks) aged <28 days with 5 older than 
14 days and 6 younger than 14 days (n=11); 8 mg/kg as a 1 hour infusion 
Plasma  concentrations  of  ceftaroline,  ceftaroline  fosamil  (prodrug)  and  ceftaroline  M-1  (inactive 
metabolite) were determined in samples obtained at end of infusion and then at 15 to 45 minutes, 3 to 4 
h and 5 to 7 h from the end of infusion. 
New studies: 
The study designs for studies P903-23, P903-24 and P903-31 are described in the clinical efficacy section. 
In  each  CSR  there  is  a  bioanalytical  report  on  the  assay  performance  and  the  individual  concentration

data are listed for ceftaroline, ceftaroline fosamil and the open ring form (M-1). Due to sparse sampling, 
the data were included in the POPPK and PK-PD analyses and not analysed separately.  
D3720c00004 (P903-23) acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections 
Sparse  PK  blood  sampling  (2  samples  of  no  more  than  2  mL/kg  per  patient)  was  performed  only  at 
selected study centres, and for only those patients that consented to PK evaluation and were randomized 
to ceftaroline fosamil. A total of 198 plasma samples from 99 patients in the ceftaroline treatment group 
were analysed. 
D3720c00007 (P903-31) community-acquired bacterial pneumonia requiring hospitalization 
Sparse PK blood sampling was conducted as above.  
D3720c00013 (P903-24) complicated community-acquired bacterial pneumonia 
Sparse PK blood sampling was conducted as above.  
Dose selection for P903-23, P903-31 and P903-24: 
The  POPPK  models  for  ceftaroline  fosamil  and  ceftaroline  from  the  original  MAA  were  updated  to 
incorporate  data  in  adolescents  (12  to  <18  years)  from  P903-15  and  to  include  allometric  scaling  of  PK 
parameters by weight for children. Data from several additional studies in adults were added to the model 
and the dose range was limited to 250 mg to 1000 mg. 
The  initial  POPPK  model  comprised  11  Phase  1  studies  in  healthy  volunteers,  4  Phase  2/3  studies  in 
patients with cSSTI and 2 Phase 3 studies in patients with CAP. Interim PK data from P903-21 were then 
added and the final POPPK model consisted of a simultaneous two-compartment disposition model for the 
prodrug ceftaroline fosamil and a two-compartment disposition model for ceftaroline.  
As  in  the  previous  model  the  variability  in  clearance  was  primarily  predicted  by  creatinine  clearance 
(normalized  by  BSA).  The  relationship  between  age  and  clearance  was  estimated  and  kept  constant  for 
children 2 to <18 years of age. For children aged < 2 years a published sigmoid hyperbolic model based 
on  post-menstrual  age  was  used  to  account  for  maturation  of  renal  function.  The  model  adequately 
predicted observed data in paediatric patients and adults. 
The  model  was  then  used  to  simulate  a  range  of  dose  regimens  to  assess  steady-state  exposure 
measures (Cmax, AUC and %fT>MIC) and make dose recommendations for the three new studies.  
Three thousand patients (1000 per cohort) aged 2 to <18 years and 3000 aged 28 days to <24 months 
were simulated with a uniform distribution for each year of age for those 2 years and older or each month 
for  those  aged  <24  months.  An  equal  number  of  males  and  females  were  simulated.  Body  weights  for 
each simulated patient were predicted based on age in accordance with CDC growth charts. For children 
<24 months, dosing scenarios with various infusion lengths (1, 1.5 and 2 h) and dose amounts (4, 6, 8, 
10 and 12 mg/kg) were simulated. In all simulated scenarios, the dose was capped based on weight so 
that  paediatric  patients  would  not  receive  more  than  the  currently  approved  adult  dose  per  day  (1200 
mg/day).  
For P903-23 and P903-31, the goal was to select doses to match or exceed the %fT>MIC in adults dosed 
with ceftaroline fosamil 600 mg q12h without appreciably exceeding the Cmax and AUC in adults at this 
dose. For P903-24, which enrolled subjects with complicated CAP, the goal was to select doses to match 
or exceed the %fT>MIC in adults dosed with ceftaroline fosamil 600 mg q8h. Based on the simulations, 
the following dose regimens were selected:

Results 
P903-15 
The nine adolescents dosed in this study had a mean age of 13.7 years (range 12-16 years) and included 
5 male and 4 female subjects. Mean BMI was 21.51 kg/m2 and mean CrCl was 156.84 mL/minute. The 
actual amount of ceftaroline administered ranged from 320 to 600 mg based on a weight range of 40.6 to 
79.1  kg.  Eight  subjects  received  a  complete  single  dose  of  ceftaroline  fosamil  while  one  refused  further 
infusion  after  receiving  about  80%  (199  ml  and  406  mg)  of  the  planned  dose  of  510  mg  based  on  a 
weight of 64 kg) because of extravasation at the infusion site. The PK data are summarised in the table 
below: 
Table 7:  
PK parameters (mean±SD) for ceftaroline, ceftaroline fosamil and ceftaroline M1 
following a single intravenous dose of ceftaroline fosamil-PK population 
One  patient  had  unusually  low  plasma  concentrations  of  ceftaroline  and  unusually  high  plasma 
concentrations of ceftaroline M-1.  
For example, Cmax ceftaroline was only 18% and AUC0-∞ was only 14% compared to the mean values 
for the other subjects whereas AUC0-∞ ceftaroline M-1 was 3.5-times the mean for the others. Excluding 
data  from  this  patient  resulted  in  significantly  lower  standard  deviations  for  mean  PK  parameters  and 
gave  higher  mean  Cmax  and  AUC0-∞  ceftaroline  values  (17031.49  ±  3632.80  ng/ml  and  43569.02  ± 
10110.04 ng•h/ml) compared to the table below. After exclusion of the data, the re-calculated mean T½ 
for ceftaroline was 1.86 ± 0.17 h and ~55% of the dose was excreted in urine.  
The mean Cmax and AUC0-∞ for ceftaroline in these adolescents were about 10% and 23% less than the 
values  observed  in  adult  subjects  following  a  600  mg  dose  of  ceftaroline  fosamil  in  P903-01.  After 
exclusion  of  the  subject  with  unusual  PK  ceftaroline  the  mean  Cmax  for  ceftaroline  M-1  was  1250.07  ±

515.80 ng/ml (~ 7% Cmax ceftaroline) and the mean AUC0-∞ was 8466.58 ± 1574.58 ng•h/ml (~ 19% 
of the AUC0-∞ ceftaroline). The mean T½ for ceftaroline M-1 was 3.41 ± 0.39 h and approximately 4.4% 
of the dose was excreted in urine as ceftaroline M-1.  
Ceftaroline fosamil was rapidly converted to ceftaroline and was generally only measurable in plasma for 
0.25 to 1 h after the end of study drug infusion. The mean Cmax for ceftaroline fosamil was 3693.58 ± 
3414.65  ng/ml  (~  22%  of  the  Cmax  for  ceftaroline)  and  the  mean  AUC0-t  was  2591.71  ±  2515.79 
ng•h/ml (~ 6% of the AUC0-t for ceftaroline). Ceftaroline fosamil was not measurable in urine samples. 
P903-21 
Ceftaroline  was  measurable  in  all  PK  samples  and  all  patients  had  ceftaroline plasma  concentrations  >1 
μg/mL in samples collected 3 to 4 h after the end of the infusion. The majority (45/53) had >1 μg/mL in 
samples collected 5 to 7 h after the end of infusion.  
The  mean  end  of  infusion  (Cmax)  concentrations  of  ceftaroline  were  lower  in  Cohorts  4  and  5  than  in 
Cohorts  1,  2,  or  3  but  the  lower  dose  may  not  fully  explain  the  lower  Cmax.  In  contrast,  mean 
concentrations at 5 to 7 h post-infusion were higher for Cohorts 4 and 5 compared with Cohorts 1, 2, and 
3, which suggested slower clearance in the youngest groups consistent with immature renal function. In 
keeping  with  the  finding,  ceftaroline  plasma  concentrations  in  samples  collected  during  the  last  2  PK 
collection  intervals  tended  to  be  higher  in  patients  aged  from  birth  to  14  days  compared  to  those  aged 
>14 to <28 days.

Ceftaroline fosamil plasma concentrations were variable and were typically only measurable at the end of 
the  infusion  or  within  15-45  min  post-infusion.  Eight  had  no  measurable  ceftaroline  fosamil  in  any 
samples but had ceftaroline and ceftaroline M-1 levels that were consistent with appropriate dosing. 
The  highest  mean  ceftaroline  M-1  plasma  concentration  occurred  in  samples  collected  at  3  to  4  h  post-
infusion.  At  the  end  of  infusion,  mean  ceftaroline  M-1  plasma  concentrations  in  each  cohort  were 
approximately  3%  to  4%  of  mean  ceftaroline  plasma  concentrations  at  the  same  time.  For  plasma 
samples  collected  5  to  7  h  after  the  end  of  infusion,  mean  ceftaroline  M-1  levels  were  53.3%,  50.3%, 
51.1%, 26.0% and 25.7% of mean ceftaroline levels at the same time for Cohorts 1-5, respectively. 
D3720c00004 (P903-23) acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections 
A total of 198 plasma samples from 99 patients in the ceftaroline treatment group were analysed. 
D3720c00007 (P903-31) community-acquired bacterial pneumonia requiring hospitalization 
A total of 228 plasma samples from 116 patients in the ceftaroline treatment group were analysed. There 
were 22 patients with samples taken near the end of a ceftaroline fosamil infusion in which concentrations 
of  ceftaroline  were  above  30  mg/L,  including  12  with  30-40  mg/L  and  a  maximum  level  of  68.9  mg/L. 
These levels exceeded the upper limit of the 90% prediction interval for the expected maximum plasma 
concentration in adults dosed with 600 mg q12h. However, concentrations had decreased by 4 to 50-fold 
by  the  time  of  the  next  PK  sample  from  the  same  patient  (typically  3-4  hours  later).  Safety  data  from 
these patients did not show trends in AEs or in laboratory abnormalities. The MAH concluded that the high 
concentrations may reflect sampling from sites near the site of infusion (e.g. the same arm). 
D3720c00013 (P903-24) complicated community-acquired bacterial pneumonia 
A total of 58 plasma samples from 29 patients in the ceftaroline treatment group were analysed. 
The MAH compiled the paediatric PK data to support modelling and simulations. 
The application contained a POPPK report dated 2011, which included P903-15 but not the data from the 
sequential studies in children, and a PK-PD report dated January 2015. The former report (CPT-MS-14) 
comprises  the  analyses  reported  above  that  were  used  to  select  the  dose  regimens  for  the  three  new 
paediatric studies. The latter report (CPT-MS-08) is the most relevant to this extension of indication and 
included all the available paediatric data.  
Population PK modelling 
After the completion of the three new studies the POPPK model for ceftaroline and ceftaroline fosamil was 
updated to include the new data and also the final data from P903-21. 
o  The  resulting  ceftaroline  POPPK  dataset  comprised  525  patients  and  195  healthy  subjects  or 
subjects  with  various  degrees  of  renal  impairment  contributing  a  total  of  6633  measurable 
concentrations (1799 ceftaroline fosamil and 4834 ceftaroline). 
o  Of the 525 patients 305 paediatric patients contributed a total of 974 measurable concentrations 
(234 ceftaroline fosamil and 740 ceftaroline).  
o  Of these 305 patients, 42 were ≥12 to <18 years of age, 74 were ≥6 to <12 years, 102 were ≥2 
to  <6  years,  64  were  ≥24  days  and  <2  years,  12  were  term  neonates  (gestational  age  ≥38 
weeks, ages <28 days) and 11 were preterm neonates (gestational age 32-37 weeks, ages <28 
days).  
o  The paediatric population consisted of 173 males and 132 females with ages ranging from 1 day 
to 18 years and weights ranging from 1.5 to 100 kg. All (with one exception) had either normal

Paediatric  patients  demonstrated  similar  PK  for  ceftaroline  as  adult  patients  after  accounting  for  weight 
and  maturational  changes.  The  combined  ceftaroline  fosamil  and  ceftaroline  population  PK  model 
provided  a  good  description  of  the  observed  data.  Diagnostic  plots  stratified  by  age  group  and  study 
revealed  that  the  model was  consistent  with  the  observed  data  and  no  systematic  bias  was  evident.  All 
paediatric  age  groups  were  adequately  described  by  the  model.  This  population  PK  model  was  used  to 
generate individual predicted PK parameters for patients that had PK samples collected, as summarised in 
the tables below. 
The  final  combined  POPPK  model  for  ceftaroline  fosamil  and  ceftaroline  was  used  to  simulate  plasma 
concentration-time  data  using  the  current  ceftaroline  dosing  regimen  for  adults  and  various  dosing 
regimens for paediatric patients (preterm neonates to <18 years old) with normal renal function, or mild 
renal  impairment.  Concentration  data  were  simulated  at  steady-state.  Weights  for  the  paediatric  age 
groups  were  based  on  CDC  Growth  Charts.  Covariates  for  the  adult  simulations  were  generated  from  a 
multivariate normal distribution based on the covariances observed in the POPPK data in patients.

One  hundred  simulations  were  performed  for  each  mg/kg  dose,  with  600  (300  male  and  300  female) 
patients  per  1  week  age  group  from  28  to  40  post-menstrual  weeks  for  each  renal  function  category

female) patients from each 1 month age group from 0 to <18 years for each renal function category for 
each  simulation.  For  adults,  300  patients  were  simulated  for  each  dose  and  renal  function  category  for 
each of the 100 simulated data sets. Results were summarized as the median (90% prediction interval),

calculated as median (of the 100 medians), median (of the 100 5th percentiles) and median (of the 100 
95th percentiles) by age group. 
From these simulations the area under the AUC24SS and CmaxSS  were compared to simulations for adult 
patients  at  steady-state. Paediatric  simulations  using  1  h  infusions  were  compared  to  adults  dosed  with 
600  mg  q12h  over  1  h  and  those  using  2  h  infusions  were  compared  to  adults  dosed  with  600  mg  q8h 
with a 1 or 2 h infusion. Simulations are summarized by age group for normal renal function patients and 
those with mild impairment according to the regimens used in P903-23 and P903-31. It should be noted 
that  the  600  mg  q8h  adult  dose  regimen  is  not  currently  approved  in  adults  and  the  MAH  does  not 
propose to include equivalent dosing for children in this extension of indication application.

suggested that doses that are lower and more reflective of exposure in adults may be efficacious in the 
≤24 months age group. 
Proposed paediatric doses 
The  %fT>MIC  for  ceftaroline  was  previously  identified  as  the  PK/PD  index  and  the  PK/PD  targets  are  
shown  below  for  Staphylococcus  aureus,  Streptococcus  pneumoniae  and  Enterobacteriaceae  based  on  a 
neutropenic murine thigh and lung infection model.  
Table 15 
Median (min-max range) of the PK/PD target (%fT>MIC) based on in vivo 
efficacy of ceftaroline in the neutropenic murine thigh infection model against 
various CAP pathogens 
Paediatric dose selection was based on predictions of achieving 36%, 44% or 73% fT>MIC for S. aureus, 
S.  pneumoniae  and  Enterobacteriaceae,  respectively.  The  final  dose  selection  was  based  on  achieving 
>90% PTA against the current breakpoints of 1 mg/L for S. aureus, 0.25 mg/L for S. pneumoniae and 0.5 
mg/L for Enterobacteriaceae. 
Based  on  meeting  the  criteria  described  above  the  proposed  doses  for  paediatric  patients  are  not  the 
same  as  the  doses  used  in  the  clinical  studies.  As  shown  below,  12  mg/kg  q8h  as  a  1  h  infusion  in 
children aged from ≥ 24 months to < 18 years and 8 mg/kg q8h as 1 h infusion in children aged from ≥ 
2 months to < 24 months achieved good PTA in subsets with normal and mildly impaired renal function:

Based  on  the  PTA  the  proposed  q8h  dose  for  those  aged  6  to  <24  months  has  been  lowered  from  that 
used in the clinical studies (see predicted exposures at the doses that were used in tables 5 and 6 above, 
which include the 2-<6 month group not shown again in Table 10) to 8 mg/kg q8h. This dose reduces the 
exposures in children aged 6-24 months and makes them more comparable with adults as shown below.

CHMP  noted  that  the  MAH  did  not  explain  why  dose  recommendations  are  not  made  for  infants  <  2 
months and that it did not discuss the additional analyses provided in CPT-MS-08.  
The  following  tables  present  the  target  data  as  median  (90%  prediction  interval)  of  the  %fT>MIC 
predicted.  
A dose of 4 mg/kg q8h as a 1 h infusion to preterm neonates (GA 28 to <40 weeks) and infants up to <2 
months is predicted to provide median ceftaroline AUC24SS that range from 59.5% to 77.8% and median 
ceftaroline  CmaxSS  that  range  from  35.3%  to  44.7%  of  the  respective  adult  median  values  using  the 
approved adult dose. The report states that the median free percent time above MIC (fPTAM) for MICs of 
1 and 2 mg/L were similar to or exceeded median fPTAM values in adults.

(74.6%  to  97.6%  and  38.9%  to  49.2%,  respectively)  than  shown  above.  The  report  states  that  the

dosed  q8h  dosing  using  1-h  or  2-h  infusions.  The  predicted  exposures  at  these  alternative  paediatric 
doses  using  2  h  infusions  are  of  some  interest  and  can  be  compared  to  the  results  in  adults  using  the 
approved regimen of q12h with 1 h infusions as shown in the tables above. 
Compared to the approved adult dose in normal renal function (600 mg q12h using 1-h infusions) shown 
in the tables above, 5 mg/kg doses using 2-h infusions in the age groups shown in the tables below give 
similar or slightly lower AUCs.

It  was  clarified  by  the  MAH  during  the  procedure  that  dosing  recommendations  for  children  below  2 
months of age will be the subject of a future application and that the suitability of the dose resulting from 
the above (5 mg/kg in a 2h infusion) will be considered, along with the suitability of any other proposed 
dose. This was agreed by CHMP. 
Adolescents 12 - < 17 years 
The initial dose recommendation proposed by the MAH for adolescents (400 mg q8h) differed from that in 
adults (600 mg q12h). Since it was unusual that adolescents are dosed differently to adults with 
antibacterial agents, especially for beta-lactam agents with relatively simple pharmacokinetics, CHMP 
asked the MAH to clarify this aspect.

The  updated  report  presented  results  from  Monte  Carlo  simulations  that  used  the  final  population  PK 
model,  a  measure  of  parameter  uncertainty  and  appropriate  covariate  distributions  for  steady-state 
simulations  of  ceftaroline.    Simulations  were  performed  for  the  approved  adult  regimen  and  dosing 
regimens  for  patients  aged  6  to  <18  years  with  normal  renal  function  or  mild  or  moderate  renal 
impairment. Covariates for the adult simulations were generated from a multivariate normal distribution 
based on the co-variances observed in the population PK data in patients. Weights for the paediatric age 
groups were based on CDC Growth Charts.  
Simulations were performed for the following regimens: 
•  
•  
•  
•  
600 mg every 12 hours as a 1 hour infusion (adult) - normal renal function 
18 mg/kg (max 600 mg) every 12 hours as a 1 hour infusion - normal renal function 
18 mg/kg (max 600 mg) every 12 hours as a 1 hour infusion - mild renal impairment 
9  mg/kg  (max  400  mg  from  44.5  kg)  every  12  hours  as  a  1  hour  infusion  -  moderate  renal 
impairment 
•  
12  mg/kg  (max  400  mg  from  33  kg)  every  12  hours  as  a  1  hour  infusion  -  moderate  renal 
impairment 
[of note, for adults with moderate renal impairment the recommended dose is 400 mg q12h] 
The  fPTAM  and  percentages  of  patients  with  a fPTAM  26%,  30%, 35%,  40%,  44%,  48.5%,  51%, 55%, 
60%  and  73%  were  presented  in  tabular  format  for  MICs  of  0.125  -  8  mg/L.  Paediatric  simulations  of 
AUC24SS,  CmaxSS  and  fPTAM  for  various  targets  were  compared  to  simulations  for  adult  patients  at 
steady state after administration of the approved dose. One hundred simulations were performed for each 
mg/kg  dose,  with  600  (300  male  and  300  female)  patients  from  each  1  month  age  group  from  6–<18 
years for normal renal function and mild or moderate renal impairment.  
For  adults,  300  patients  were  simulated  for  each  dose  for  each  of  the  100  simulated  data  sets.  Results  were 
summarised as the median  (90% prediction interval), calculated as median (of the 100 medians),  median (of the 
100 5th percentiles and 95th percentiles) by age group (6 to <12 and 12 to <18 years) and renal function category. 
Normal Renal Function - 1 hr infusion - 18 mg/kg q12h 
The 18 mg/kg dose (max 600 mg; which would be the dose used from 33 kg upwards) given every 12 h 
gave estimated PK parameters in adolescents that were very similar to those using the approved dose in 
adults as shown below.

Mild Renal Impairment - 1 hr infusion 
The  18  mg/kg  q12h  dose  in  adolescents  with  mild  renal  impairment  gave  slightly  higher  exposures 
compared to adolescents with normal renal function. The  ratios for Cmax and AUC  vs. adults were both 
1.4-fold.

The  reduction  to  9  mg/kg  (maximum  400  mg)  q12h  gave  predicted  exposures  in  adolescents  with 
moderate renal impairment that were almost identical to those in adults using the approved regimen for 
normal renal function.

Ratios based on summary of 100 trials. Ratios are relative to adult dosing regimen and represent 
ratio of paediatric median to adult median for adult dose of 600 mg q12h 1 hr inf. 
The  MAH  acknowledged  that  using  the  updated  POPPK  model,  the  predicted  exposure  estimates  from 
q12h  have  changed  such  that  Cmax  was  more  aligned  with  the  adult  data.  The  basis  for  the  MAH 
proposal  of  thrice  daily  dosing  in  adolescents  relied  on  the  fact  that  i)  the  predicted  exposure  in 
adolescents dosed was seen by the MAH to be more comparable than q12h dosing to the adult exposures 
using the approved regimen, that ii) thrice daily dosing was predicted to provide improved PTA over q12h 
dosing  and  that  iii)  the  safety  pool  generated  in  paediatric  clinical  trials  was  considered  reassuring  and 
supportive than the evidence for the q12h dosing.  
On  the  first  point,  CHMP  analysed  the  comparisons  between  adolescents  and  adults  with  normal  renal 
function or mild renal impairment using 600 mg q12h (or 18 mg/kg q12h up to 33 kg) and concluded that 
the claim that the predicted exposure in adolescents dosed q8h is more comparable than q12h dosing to 
the  adult  exposures  using  the  approved  regimen  was  not  well  justified.  Taking  also  into  account  that 
safety issues for ceftaroline associated with a <1.5-fold increase in Cmax that would arise if adolescents 
of  at  least  33  kg  were  to  be  given  600  mg  q12h  were  unlikely,  CHMP  was,  based  on  the  additional 
simulation data provided by the MAH, of the view that once adolescents (above 12 years of age) reach 33 
kg they could be treated with 600 mg q12h. 
At the same time it was considered that children aged 2-<18 years of < 33 kg could receive the proposed 
dose  of  12  mg/kg  q8h.  All  of  the  above  were  agreed  upon  by  the  MAH  and  the  updated  dose 
recommendation was implemented in the Zinforo PI.  
Furthermore, the MAH proposed to also apply the adult dose adjustments for severe renal impairment to 
adolescents from 12 years and from 33 kg body weight. CHMP considered this proposal to be acceptable. 
The MAH presented the simulation for children aged from 12 years and with body weight from 33 kg with 
severe  renal  impairment  if  given  the  recommended adult  dose  adjustment  (reduction  to  300  mg  q12h). 
Compared with adults with normal renal function dosed with 600 mg q12h the adjusted dose in this age 
and  weight  subset  provides  a  similar  Cmax  and  slightly  higher  AUC  and  hence  higher  f%T>MIC.  The 
slightly higher predicted AUC falls between that observed in adults with normal renal function given 600 
mg q12h and 600 mg q8h. 
The  results  are  based  on  simulating  9  mg/kg  q12h  with  a  cap  at  the  adult  dose  for  severe  renal 
impairment (300 mg q12h), which is reached at 33 kg.

impairment  following  9  mg/kg  (max  of  300  mg)  q12h  dosing  (1h  infusion)  to 
steady-state for ceftaroline in paediatric patients based on simulations 
The  simulation  for  6  mg/kg  q12h  in  this  subset  also  compared  well  with  adult  exposures  (see  table 
extract  below)  but  the  difference  in  AUC  vs.  9  mg/kg  q12h  as  shown  above,  which  allows  for  a  simple 
strategy  of  applying  the  adult  dose  adjustments  to  adolescents  of  at  least  33  kg  body  weight,  seems 
unlikely to be clinically important in terms of safety. 
The applicant’s additional proposal to apply the adult dose adjustments for severe renal impairment and 
ESRD to adolescents from 12 years and from 33 kg body weight was also considered to be acceptable by 
CHMP. This has not been simulated but there will be very few such patients and all other simulations do 
suggest that the adult regimens are suitable for this age and weight subset.

2 months to < 24 months  8 mg/kg 
every 8 hours

CHMP  agreed  that  the  MAH’s  approach  to  dose  finding  in  paediatric  patients  has  been  broadly 
appropriate.  
CHMP  considered  that the  adjustment  of the  dose  for  the  age  range  6-<  24 months  to  reduce  this to 8 
mg/kg  q8h  rather  than  the  12  mg/kg  q8h  that  was  actually  studied  seemed  appropriate,  giving  a 
standard dose across the age range 2-< 24 months.  During the procedure, the MAH explained the lack of 
dose  recommendations  for  patients  <  2  months  at  this  time  point,  but  clarified  that  these  will  be 
proposed for regulatory review in the future. CHMP agreed to this proposal.  
It was also agreed by CHMP that adolescents with a body weight of less than 33 kilograms would receive 
the  same  12  mg/kg  dose  administered  every  eight  hours,  whereas  adolescents  with  a  body  weight  of 
more or equal than 33 kg would receive the adult dose (600 mg every 12 hours).  
The final agreed posology in children with normal renal function is: 
Age/weight range 
Dose 
Frequency 
Infusion 
time 
(minutes) 
≥2 months to < 2 years 
8 mg/kg 
every 8 hours

≥ 12 years to <18 years  
600 mg 
every 12 hours  60 
(≥33 kg) 
*the dose administerd every 8 hours should not exceed 400 mg 
The  adequate  posology  for  children  above  the  age  of  2  months  depending  of  their  renal  function  status 
was also agreed. 
The POPPK model was considered very complex by CHMP, but was deemed comprehensive and the fact 
that the MAH report included extensive diagnostic plots was appreciated. It  could be concluded that the 
model appeared to be appropriate for use in predicting doses for children.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main studies 
D3720c00004 (P903-23) acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections 
This was a multicentre, randomized, observer-blinded, active-controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate 
the efficacy, safety, and PK of intravenous (IV) ceftaroline versus IV comparator (vancomycin or cefazolin 
with or without aztreonam) in children aged 2 months to < 18 years with ABSSSI.  
Eligible patients were to have ABSSSI defined as: 
•  Abscess:  presence  of  a  loculated  fluid  collection  with  erythema,  oedema  or  induration  that 
extended  from  the  abscess  margin  and  onset  within  7  days  before  randomisation.  A  “major 
abscess”  either  extended  to  deeper  soft  tissue  or  required  significant  surgical  intervention. 
Incision and drainage was to be conducted within 24 h after first dose of IV study drug.  
•  Wound  infection:  presence  of  either  purulent/seropurulent  discharge  from  the surgical/traumatic 
wound  with  erythema,  oedema  or  induration  that  surrounded  the  wound  margin.  Onset  of 
infection must have occurred within 7 days before randomisation and within 30 days following the 
trauma or surgical procedure.  
•  Cellulitis/erysipelas:  presence  of  advancing  erythema,  induration/oedema  and  heat  with  onset 
within 7 days before randomisation.  
In  addition  at  least  1  of  the  following  local  signs  and  symptoms  of  acute  infection  were  to  have  been 
present for < 10 days: 
• 
• 
• 
Purulent or seropurulent drainage or discharge 
Induration/oedema 
Fluctuance 
•  Heat or localized warmth 
AND the presence of at least 1 of the following signs: 
• 
Fever (> 38°C [100.4°F]) or hypothermia (< 35°C [95.0°F]); not axillary 
•  WBC count > 12,000/mm3 
  10% immature neutrophils (bands) regardless of total peripheral WBC 
• 
Lymphangitic spread 
Block 2:1 randomisation (IXRS) was used to assign patients to ceftaroline (min 180) or comparator (min 
90). Stratification was by age cohort and region. Enrolment was in 4 cohorts as follows: 
•  Cohort 1: children from 12 years to < 18 years 
•  Cohort 2: children from 6 years to < 12 years 
•  Cohort 3: children from 24 months to < 6 years 
•  Cohort 4: young infants/toddlers from 2 months to < 24 months 
Efforts  were  made  to  enrol  at  least  27  (10%)  in  each  of  the  age  cohorts.  The  IXRS  was  also  used  to 
assign patients at a 1:1 ratio to PK schedule 1 or 2 for the collection of blood samples for PK analysis.

Ceftaroline fosamil was dosed using 1-h infusions q8h as follows: 
o  ≥ 6 months: 12 mg/kg if ≤ 33 kg or 400 mg if > 33 kg  
o  < 6 months: 8 mg/kg  
The comparator group received one of the following (dose adjustments were allowed): 
o 
o 
IV vancomycin 15 mg/kg infused over 60 minutes every 6 hours 
IV cefazolin 75 mg/kg infused over 60 (± 10) minutes every 8 hours 
o  Optional aztreonam 30 mg/kg infused over 60 (± 10) minutes every 8 hours 
Treatment  was  for  a  maximum  of  14  days.  A  switch  to  an  open-label  oral  drug  on  or  after  Day  4  was 
allowed if all of the protocol-specified criteria were met (cephalexin [preferred], clindamycin or linezolid). 
A DSMB reviewed safety data from this study. 
The overall study design and visits were as shown in the following figure:

Results 
Of  the  163  enrolled  there  were  159  treated  patients,  all  of  whom  had  a  confirmed  diagnosis  of  ABSSSI 
and were included in the MITT population while 74 (45%) were included in the mMITT population (had a

baseline pathogen). The majority (90.2% and 92.6% per treatment group) completed study drug therapy 
and the study.  
Table 28 
Subject disposition and reason for premature discontinuations-ITT population 
The highest enrolment by age cohort was in Cohort 2 (6 to < 12 years). 
The  majority  of  patients  had  cellulitis  or  erysipelas  (66%)  followed  by  major  abscesses  (25%)  and  the 
most  common  body  sites  affected  were  similar  between  groups.  Signs  and  symptoms  of  ABSSSI  at 
baseline  were  also  balanced  between treatment groups  and  most  were  of  moderate to  severe intensity. 
Abscesses had been drained for ~20% per group. The primary infection site areas were similar between 
treatment groups with median (range) infection areas of 108 cm2 (3.8, 742.5) and 112 cm2 (19.3, 874.0) 
in the comparator group.  
Overall  45.9%  had  Gram-positive  pathogens  and Staphylococcus  aureus  was  the  most  common  (40.2% 
and 42.3% per group), of which most were MSSA (18 ceftaroline and 6 comparator patients had MRSA). 
S.  pyogenes  was  identified  for  12.1%  in  the  ceftaroline  group  and  1.9%  in  the  comparator  group.  Most 
(87.8%)  infections  were  monomicrobial.  The  highest  ceftaroline  MICs  observed  were  1  μg/mL  for  S. 
aureus (including MRSA) and 0.015 μg/mL for S. pyogenes.

Approximately  67%  had  received  prior  antibacterial  therapy  and  57%  had  been  treated  for  at  least  24 
hours. Twelve of the 16 (10.1%) who had received > 24 hours of prior therapy were confirmed treatment 
failures. 
At  Study  Day  3  in  the  MITT  Population  the  response  to  treatment  was  similar  between  treatments 
according to the three parameters shown below.  
Table  29 
Clinical response at study day 3 by treatment group overall (MITT population) 
Clinical cure rates at TOC in the MITT population were 94.4% for the ceftaroline group and 86.5% for the 
comparator group, with a treatment difference of 7.9 (95% CI –1.2, 20.2). Clinical cure rates at TOC for 
the  CE  Population  were  100.0%  for  the  ceftaroline  group  and  97.8%  for  the  comparator  group  with  a 
treatment difference of 2.2% (95% CI –1.7, 11.6). 
Table   30 
Clinical outcomes at TOC by treatment group overall (MITT population) 
The  most  common  reasons  for  an  indeterminate  outcome  were  extenuating  circumstances  and  lost  to 
follow-up. Cure rates by age cohort are shown in the following table.

In  the  mMITT  population  the  cure  rates  at  TOC  were  94.2%  for  ceftaroline  and  81.8%  for  comparator. 
The  clinical  cure  rates  for  the  two  major  pathogens  are  shown  in  the  following  table.  Microbiological 
responses followed the clinical responses. 
Table 32 
Clinical outcome at the test of cure visit by baseline pathogen (mMITT

The  same  percentages  had  a  favourable  microbiological  response  (i.e.  eradication  presumed). 
Colonisation  occurred  in  2  (3.8%)  ceftaroline  and  3  (13.6%)  comparator  patients.  No  new  infections  or 
superinfections  occurred  during  the  study.  There  were  no  documented  relapses  and  the  sustained  cure 
rates at LFU were 99/101 and 45/45. 
Outcomes by gender, region, baseline CrCL and type of baseline infection showed comparable or slightly 
higher cure rates for ceftaroline vs. comparator. 
D3720c00007 (P903-31) community-acquired bacterial pneumonia requiring hospitalization 
This was a Phase 2/3 multicentre, randomized, observer-blinded, active-controlled study to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, PK, and efficacy of ceftaroline versus ceftriaxone in paediatric patients aged 2 months 
to < 18 years with CABP requiring hospitalization. 
Assessment report

Eligible patients  were  to  have  CABP  that  required  hospitalization  and  IV  antibacterial  therapy  and  which 
met each of the following criteria: 
I.  
Fever (temperature > 38.0°C) or hypothermia (temperature < 35.0°C) (not axillary) 
II.  
New infiltrate(s) compatible with bacterial pneumonia, including a new alveolar/lobar infiltrate or 
consolidation (based on imaging results or diagnostic testing) 
III.  
Acute  onset  or  worsening  within  the  previous  5  days  before  randomisation  of  at  least  2  of  the 
following clinical signs or symptoms: 
○ Cough 
○ Tachypnoea, defined as: 
2 months to < 12 months: ≥ 50 breaths/min 
12 months to < 5 years: ≥ 40 breaths/min 
≥ 5 years: ≥ 20 breaths/min 
○ Dyspnoea 
○ Grunting 
○ Sputum production 
○ Chest pain 
○ Cyanosis 
○ Evidence of pneumonia with parenchymal consolidation  
○ Increased work of breathing (e.g. nasal flaring, chest wall retractions) 
IV.   At least 1 of the following: 
○ Typical respiratory pathogen identified or isolated from a respiratory  or blood culture 
○ Leukocytosis (> 15,000 white blood cells [WBC]/mm3) 
○ > 15% immature neutrophils (bands) regardless of total peripheral WBC 
○ Leukopenia (< 4500 WBC/mm3) likely due to the bacterial infection 
○ Hypoxaemia (oxygen saturation < 92% on room air) 
Block randomization (3:1) using an IXRS was used to assign patients to ceftaroline (120) or ceftriaxone 
(40) with stratification by age cohort and region and using the same PK schema as above. Patients were 
enrolled  in  4  cohorts  of  descending  age  as  described  above  with  a  plan  to  enrol  at  least  16  (10%)  per 
cohort.  
Ceftaroline was dosed as described above. Ceftriaxone was dosed at 75 mg/kg/day up to a maximum of 4 
g/day.  Dosing  was  q12h  using  equally  divided  doses  infused  over  30.  A  switched  to  oral  amoxicillin 
clavulanate  up  to  90  mg/kg/day  in  two  divided  doses  (q12h)  was  allowed  on  or  after  Day  4 if  protocol-
specified  criteria  were  met.  The  total  duration  of  treatment  was  to  be  5  to  14  days  including  at  least  3 
days  (7  infusions  for  ceftaroline)  of  IV  study  drug.  A  DSMB  reviewed  safety  data  from  this  study.  The 
overall study design and visits were as shown in the following figure:

Results 
Of the 160 patients treated ~10% had a sole atypical pathogen (note this based only on a baseline IgM 
assay)  and  were  excluded  from  the  MITT  Population  (88.8%).  The  mMITT  Population  comprised  only 
20.5%  (33)  with  an  identified  typical  baseline  pathogen.  Most  (90.7%)  patients  completed  study  drug 
and 95.7% completed the study.

The highest enrolment was in Cohort 3 (24 months to < 6 years) and the lowest was in Cohort 1 (12 to < 
18 years). Hence the mean age was 4.19 years with a range 10 weeks through 17 years.  
Demographics  and  baseline  characteristics  were  balanced  between  treatment  groups.  Nasopharyngeal 
swabs for viral PCR were collected. The CSR states that the majority had 1 or more positive findings but 
no details are given. Approximately one half of patients had prior pneumococcal vaccination. 
Baseline  pneumonia  and  disease  characteristics  were  generally  similar  between  treatment  groups.  The 
median CRP was elevated at baseline and higher in the ceftriaxone vs. ceftaroline group. All patients had 
a  baseline  chest  X-ray,  and  the  majority  had  involvement  of  1  lobe.  A  higher  percentage  in  the 
ceftriaxone group had an effusion. Most pathogens were identified only by pneumococcal urinary antigen 
and few respiratory specimens were obtained (11 patients). Two were considered to have M. pneumoniae 
with a typical pathogen. Blood cultures were obtained from 97.2% but only 4.2% were positive (1 MRSA 
and 2 per group with S. pneumoniae).  
Nearly  half  (44.8%)  in  the  MITT  population  had  received  systemic  antibacterial  treatment  within  96 
hours.  Most  (30.8%)  had  received  ≤  24  hours  and  all  of  the  14%  who  had  received  >  24  hours  were 
confirmed treatment failures. 
The  clinical  response  rates  on  Day  4  (improvement  in  ≥  2/7  symptoms  and  no  worsening)  were  similar 
between  treatments  (69.2%  ceftaroline  vs.  66.7%  ceftriaxone;  difference  2.5%  [95%CI  -13.9,  20.9]). 
The  clinical  cure  rates  at  TOC  were  also  similar  between  groups  in  the  MITT  (87.9%  and  88.9%, 
respectively), CE (91.8 and 88.9%) and mMITT populations (79.2% and 77.8%; all derived from clinical 
outcomes.). Rates were comparable in the age cohorts with the largest numbers in the MITT population.

No subject had a clinical relapse at the LFU visit. One patient in the ceftaroline group with S. pneumoniae 
had  a  new  infection  (Haemophilus  parainfluenzae)  at  TOC  visit  (Day  25)  and  was  assessed  as  a  clinical 
failure since this required further antimicrobial therapy. 
D3720c00013 (P903-24) complicated community-acquired bacterial pneumonia 
This  was  a  multicentre,  randomised,  observer-blinded,  active-controlled  study  to  evaluate  the  safety, 
tolerability,  PK,  and  efficacy  of  IV  ceftaroline  fosamil  versus  IV  ceftriaxone  plus  IV  vancomycin  in 
paediatric  patients  aged  2  months  to  <  18  years  with  complicated  CABP.  It  was  designed  to  enrich  for 
patients at risk for infection due to MRSA.  
Eligible  patients  were  to  have  CABP  that  met  criteria  I-IV  as  in  study  P903-31  above  PLUS  confirmed 
presence of at least one indicator of complicated CABP or staphylococcal pneumonia as follows: 
○

absence  of  a  known  cause  other  than  influenza)  or  documented  influenza  infection  (e.g.  by 
culture or molecular testing) within 28 days of enrolment 
○  
Severe CABP, defined as requirement for treatment in an intensive care unit 
Block  randomization,  using  an  IXRS,  stratified  by  age  cohort,  was  used  to  assign  patients  (3:1)  to  the 
ceftaroline  or  comparator  group  (IV  ceftriaxone  plus  IV  vancomycin).  Patients  were  to  be  enrolled  in  4 
cohorts of descending age as described above.  
Ceftaroline fosamil was dosed using 2-h infusions q8h as follows: 
≥ 6 months: 15 mg/kg if ≤ 40 kg or 600 mg if > 40 kg  
< 6 months: 10 mg/kg

Ceftriaxone  was  dosed  at  75  mg/kg/day  up  to  a  maximum  of  4  g/day.  Dosing  was  q12h  using  equally 
divided  doses  infused  over  30  min.  Vancomycin  was  dosed  at  15  mg/kg  q6h  infused  over  at  least  60 
minutes  or  at  a  maximum  of  10  mg/min  and  could  be  discontinued  after  72  hours  of  IV  study  drug  if 
MRSA,  PRSP  or  PISP  was  not  confirmed  or  suspected.  At  study  centres  where  trough  levels  were 
measured as standard of care the values were recorded in the eCRF. 
A  switch  to  open-label  oral  study  drug  (amoxicillin  clavulanate,  clindamycin,  or  linezolid;  selected 
according to known or documented organisms and susceptibility) could occur after 72 hours of  IV study 
drug if the criteria for oral switch were met.  
o  Amoxicillin clavulanate was dosed at 45 to 90 mg/kg/day divided q12h 
o  Clindamycin was dosed at 13 mg/kg q8h 
o 
Linezolid was dosed at 600 mg q12h (Cohort 1) or 10 mg/kg q8h (Cohorts 2, 3 and 4) 
The total duration of study drug therapy was 5 to 21 days. A DSMB reviewed safety data from this study. 
The overall study design and visits were as shown in the following figure:

Results 
Of  40  patients  enrolled  (30  ceftaroline)  two  (one  per  treatment  group)  were  excluded  from  the  MITT 
population  due  to  having  a  sole  atypical  pathogen.  There  were  18  (45%)  with  at  least  one  typical 
pathogen  (mMITT  population).  The  mean  age  was  5.4  years  (range  16  weeks  through  17  years).  None 
had CrCL < 50 ml/min but one had CrCL of 355.2 mL/min/1.73m² with serum creatinine of 8.8 μmol/L. 
Seven  had  a  history  of  pneumococcal  vaccination.  Baseline  pneumonia  disease  characteristics  were 
similar  between  treatment  groups.  Approximately  40%  had  pleural  effusion  and  60%  had  multi-lobar 
involvement.

Table 35  
Demographic and baseline characteristics (MITT population) 
Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from the majority and most had one or more findings positive for 
viral testing by PCR but details are not provided. Respiratory samples were obtained from 17 patients (11 
ceftaroline).  Staphylococcus  aureus  was  cultured  from  4  ceftaroline  and  1  comparator  patients.  Two  in 
the ceftaroline group had positive blood cultures. A third had a urinary antigen test that was positive for 
S. pneumoniae.  
More  than  half  (62.1%  ceftaroline  and  55.6%  comparator)  had  received  prior  systemic  antibacterial 
medications within 96 hours. All patients who had > 24 hours prior (20.7% in the ceftaroline group and 
11.1% in the comparator group) were confirmed treatment failures. 
On Day 4 the clinical response (defined as above) rates were 51.7% in the ceftaroline group and 66.7% 
in the comparator group.  
Clinical  cure  rates  at  TOC  were  89.7%  ceftaroline  vs.  100%  comparator  in  the  MITT  population,  88.5% 
vs. 100%, respectively, in the CE population and 86.7% vs. 100%, respectively, in the mMITT population. 
Three  MITT  patients  in  the  ceftaroline  group  were  clinical  failures  but  only  one  was  due  to  insufficient 
therapeutic effect (the other two discontinued due to AEs). All but 2 in the ceftaroline group and all in the 
comparator group had a favourable microbiological outcome at TOC in the mMITT Population. 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
CHMP agreed that overall the efficacy findings are very supportive of the likely adequacy of the regimens 
tested  in  the  various  age groups,  despite  several  limitations  (e.g.  the  allowance  for  oral  switch  to other 
agents). As discussed in the clinical pharmacology section, the final dose recommendations in the SmPC 
are  not  identical  to  those  studied  clinically.  Nevertheless,  CHMP  agreed  that  the  amended  doses  are 
predicted to be adequate. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
No  outstanding  issues  could  be  identified.  CHMP  agreed  that  the  available  efficacy  data  are  broadly 
supportive.

10 days. A switch to oral occurred in 59% after a median time of 4 days and with a median duration of 
8.0 days in each treatment group. The most commonly used oral treatment was cephalexin. 
The following table summarises the AE rates:  
Table 36 
Summary of Adverse Events by treatment group overall (safety population) 
Treatment-emergent  AEs  were  more  common  in  Cohort  4  (the  youngest)  than  in  other  Cohorts  (70.8% 
ceftaroline and 61.5% comparator vs. <50% in all other cohorts). The most frequently occurring TEAEs in 
the  ceftaroline  group  were  diarrhoea,  rash  (8  [7.5%]  each)  and  vomiting  (7  [6.6%]).    Diarrhoea  and 
vomiting were also the most frequently reported TEAEs in the comparator group. 
Table 37 
Treatment-emergent adverse events reported by at least 2% of patients by 
treatment group overall (safety population) 
Most  TEAEs  were  of  mild  intensity.  Severe  TEAEs  were  reported  for  three  patients  per  group  (2.8% 
ceftaroline  vs.  5.7%  comparator).  Treatment-related  TEAEs  were  reported  for  21.7%  vs.  22.6%;  the 
most  common  in  the  ceftaroline  group  were  rash  and  eosinophilia  (5  patients;  4.7%  each  vs.  1  patient 
each in the comparator group).  
Six SAEs were reported from 5 patients including 4 [3.8%] in the ceftaroline group and 1 [1.9%] in the 
comparator group. Two SAEs in different patients in the ceftaroline group (Clostridium difficile colitis and 
hypersensitivity) were considered drug-related. Also, two in the ceftaroline group were discontinued from 
treatment due to SAEs (hypersensitivity and osteomyelitis).

List of serious adverse events (safety population)  
TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  study  drug  therapy  were  reported  for  3.8%  per  treatment  group  (4 
and  2  patients)  and  2  vs.  1  discontinued  IV  therapy.  These  included  the  two  discontinuations  of 
ceftaroline  that  resulted  from  SAEs  and  a  comparator  group  patient  who  discontinued  IV  due  to  non-
serious hypersensitivity. 
The rate of occurrence of PCS haematology and chemistry values was low, with little difference observed 
between  treatment  groups.  In  light  of  the  reported  AEs  of  eosinophilia,  PCS  values  occurred  in  two 
ceftaroline and no comparator group patients.

Median  exposure  to  IV  study  drug  was  5  days  in  the  ceftaroline  group  and  6  days  in  the  ceftriaxone 
group. There was a switch to oral study drug in 65% of patients after a median of 6 days IV. The median 
duration of oral treatment was 6 days. The overall safety data are summarised in the following table:

Summary of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events (safety 
population) 
The most commonly reported events in each treatment group were gastrointestinal events (diarrhoea and 
vomiting).  
Table 41 
Treatment-emergent adverse events reported by at least 3% of subjects (safety 
population) 
Most  TEAEs  were  assessed  by  the  Investigators  as  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.  Severe  TEAEs  were 
reported for 3 (2.5%) in the ceftaroline group (thrombocytosis, infectious plural effusion and Kawasaki’s 
disease)  and  for  one  (2.6%)  in  the  ceftriaxone  group  (2  TEAEs:  thrombocytosis  and  pulmonary 
thrombosis). TEAEs considered to be related to study drug occurred in 9.9% in the ceftaroline group and 
7.7%  in  the  ceftriaxone  group.  The  most  common  in  the  ceftaroline  group  were  diarrhoea  (4),  urticaria 
(2) and elevated transaminases (AST 2 and ALT 1). In the ceftriaxone group the TEAEs considered related 
were vulvovaginal erythema and dermatitis (1 each) and elevated AST/ALT in one patient.  
There were 8 SAEs reported from 7 patients (6 in the ceftaroline group reporting 7 SAEs), most of which 
were  infections  and  infestations  and  none  was  considered  related  to  study  drug  treatment  or  led  to 
discontinuation of assigned treatment (see following table).  
Three (2.5%) in the ceftaroline group and none in the ceftriaxone group prematurely discontinued study 
drug  due  to  AEs.  Two  discontinued  from  IV  treatment  because  of  headache  and  one  because  of  the 
change in diagnosis of Kawasaki’s disease. The other discontinued oral therapy.

A shift from negative at baseline to a positive Coomb’s test was found in 17% in the ceftaroline group and 
2.7%  in  the  ceftriaxone  group.  No  evidence  of  haemolytic  anaemia  or  haemolysis  was  identified  in  the 
study. 
D3720c00013 (P903-24) complicated community-acquired bacterial pneumonia 
The median duration of treatment with IV study drug was 9 days in the ceftaroline group and 7.5 days in 
the comparator group. In both treatment groups most switched to oral study drug (73.3% ceftaroline and

100%  comparator)  with  a  median  time  to  switch  on  Day  8  in  both  groups.  In  those  who  switched  the 
median exposure to oral study drug was 7.5 days in each group. The overall safety profile is summarised 
in the following table:

There  were  two  SAEs  (lower  respiratory  tract  viral  infection  and  upper  respiratory  tract  viral  infection), 
which were both reported for the same patient in the comparator group. 
Two  (10.0%)  in  the  ceftaroline  group  discontinued  IV  study  drug  due  to  AEs  of  ALT  increased  and  AST 
increased  (see  above  under  severe  TEAEs)  in  one  and  rash  and  pruritus  of  moderate  intensity  in  the 
other. These were considered to be drug-related. A third ceftaroline patient discontinued oral therapy.

comparator group. No evidence of haemolytic anaemia or haemolysis was identified. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The additional safety data do not raise any new concerns compared to the existing adult data. The rate of 
Coombs  test  positivity  was  already  noted  in  adults  to  be  considerably  higher  than  for  comparators  but 
thus far has not been linked to haemolytic anaemia. A statement on the safety experience in children has 
been added to section 4.8 of the Zinforo SmPC. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
CHMP agreed that the additional safety data assessed in this application do not change the known safety 
profile for Zinforo. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
N/A 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.2, 5.3 and 6.6 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.  
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template which were 
accepted by the CHMP. 
In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the 
representative of Bulgaria. 
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet was not performed and it has 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/244427/2016 
Page 51/53 
 
  
  
 
been found acceptable for the following reasons: changes made to the package leaflet were not 
considered significant and were not affecting its readability. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
CHMP agreed that the nonclinical data provided by the MAH to support the extension of use of ceftaroline 
to children aged from 2 months onwards were adequate.  
The MAH has completed a series of studies, in accordance with the agreed PIP and has used the PK data 
from  treated  children  to  derive  dose  recommendations  that  are  intended  to  provide  plasma  exposures 
comparable  with  those  in  adults.  Simulations  have  shown  that  the  final  proposed  posology  by  age  and 
weight  is  likely  to  achieve  the  target  exposures.  In  addition,  CHMP  and  the  MAH  agreed  during  the 
procedure to the posology which will be recommended for children above the age of 2 months, depending 
on their age, body weight and renal function status. 
Ceftaroline was previously shown to be efficacious in the indications granted for adults (complicated skin 
and soft tissue infections and community-acquired pneumonia) with an acceptable safety profile typical of 
that of the cephalosporins. The additional safety and efficacy data in children suggest high efficacy at the 
doses tested with a similar safety profile as that observed in adults. 
Overall, CHMP considered that the extension of use of ceftaroline to children from the age of 2 months for 
the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI) and community-acquired pneumonia 
(CAP) is acceptable and agreed that the benefit-risk ratio for Zinforo in this population is positive.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends by consensus the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, 
concerning the following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I, IIIA and 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
IIIB 
approved one  
Extension of indication for Zinforo to include a new population, children from the age of 2 months; as a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 6.6 of the SmPC have been updated with new 
information on dosing, PK and safety. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. In addition, the 
Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in 
the Package Leaflet and to align the PI with the latest QRD template 10.0. 
The requested variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and 
Package Leaflet. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/244427/2016 
Page 52/53 
 
  
  
 
 
Investigation Plan P/0074/2014 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 
8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Extension of indication for Zinforo to include a new population, children from the age of 2 months; as a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 6.6 of the SmPC have been updated with new 
information on dosing, PK and safety. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. In addition, the 
Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in 
the Package Leaflet and to align the PI with the latest QRD template 10.0.

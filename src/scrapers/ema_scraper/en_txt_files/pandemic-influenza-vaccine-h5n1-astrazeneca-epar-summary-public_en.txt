EPAR summary for the public 
Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca1 
pandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (live attenuated, nasal) 
This is a summary of the European public assessment report (EPAR) for Pandemic influenza vaccine 
H5N1 AstraZeneca. It explains how the Agency assessed the medicine to recommend its authorisation 
in the EU and its conditions of use. It is not intended to provide practical advice on how to use 
Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca. 
For practical information about using Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca, patients should 
read the package leaflet or contact their doctor or pharmacist. 
What is Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca and what is it used 
for? 
Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca is a vaccine developed to protect children aged between 
12 months and 18 years against influenza (flu) during a flu pandemic. 
A flu pandemic occurs when a new strain of flu virus appears that can spread easily because people 
have no immunity (protection) against it. It can particularly affect children who have not had seasonal 
flu or received flu vaccines previously. A flu pandemic can affect people worldwide and cause many 
deaths.  
Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca contains live, attenuated (weakened) influenza A virus 
A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) strain.  
How is Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca used? 
Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca is available as a nasal spray. The dose is one spray 
(0.1 ml) into each nostril. Two doses of the vaccine are recommended and the child should receive the 
second dose at least 4 weeks after the first.

The vaccine can only be obtained with a prescription. It should be given in an officially declared 
pandemic and according to official guidance. 
How does Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca work? 
A vaccine against a specific disease ‘teaches’ the immune system (the body’s natural defences) to 
defend itself against the disease. Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca is a pandemic 
preparedness vaccine. This vaccine is intended to help with the management of a future pandemic. 
It is not possible to prepare a vaccine for a future pandemic because the strain of the pandemic flu 
virus is not known in advance. Instead, a pandemic preparedness vaccine can be made to contain a 
bird flu virus strain that could potentially cause a future pandemic. Most people will not have come into 
contact with it and therefore will not have built up protection (‘immunity’) against it. Testing this 
pandemic preparedness vaccine helps to predict how people will react to the vaccine at the time of a 
pandemic, when the virus strain in the vaccine will be replaced by a weakened version of the actual 
strain causing the pandemic. 
When a child is given the vaccine, the immune system recognises the weakened virus in the vaccine as 
foreign and makes antibodies against it. The immune system will then be able to produce antibodies 
more quickly and in large numbers when it comes into contact with the virus again. This helps to 
protect against the flu that the virus causes. 
What benefits of Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca have been 
shown in studies? 
Because a new pandemic live attenuated vaccine cannot be tested in children, the benefit of this 
vaccine in children was predicted from studies in adults and from studies of similar live attenuated flu 
vaccines in children. 
Three main studies involving 107 adults found that Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca was 
able to prepare the immune system to defend itself against the H5N1 virus strain in individuals who 
had never come into contact with it. Antibodies against this type of vaccine are not easy to measure. 
However, a second vaccine that acts in a different way is able to make antibodies that can be 
measured easily. In those who received the second vaccine 3 weeks to 5 years after vaccination with 
Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca, antibodies increased 4-fold in 73% (8 out of 11) of the 
individuals compared with 10% of the individuals who had not been previously vaccinated with 
Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca. This showed that antibodies against Pandemic 
influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca increased substantially when vaccinated adults came into contact 
with the virus again. In addition, there is evidence indicating that the vaccine can protect against 
different strains of H5N1 virus. The results were similar to those from three other studies involving 170 
adults given pandemic preparedness vaccines containing similar types of bird flu virus, such as H7N9 
and H7N7, instead of H5N1.    
In addition, the company presented extensive supportive data from large studies and from clinical 
practice on how well other similar pandemic and seasonal live attenuated influenza A vaccines work in 
children. 
Further studies on the effects on the vaccine in children will need to be provided once the the flu strain 
causing the pandemic is included in the vaccine.

What are the risks associated with Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 
AstraZeneca? 
The most common side effects with Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca (which may affect 
more than 1 in 10 people) are decreased appetite, headache, runny or stuffy nose, and feeling unwell. 
For the full list of all side effects reported with Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca, see the 
package leaflet. 
Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca must not generally be given to children who have had a 
severe allergic reaction to any of the substances in the vaccine including gelatin and gentamicin or to 
children who have had a severe allergic reaction to eggs or egg proteins, such as ovalbumin. However, 
in a pandemic, it might be appropriate to give it to children with allergies if facilities for medical 
treatment of severe allergic reactions are immediately available. For the full list of restrictions, see the 
package leaflet. 
Why is Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca approved? 
The Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) noted that preparing for a 
potential flu pandemic in children and adolescents meets an important medical need. The vaccine is 
expected to protect children against pandemic flu, on the basis of data obtained with this vaccine in 
adults. This is further supported by data in children given similar seasonal and pandemic live 
attenuated flu vaccines in large studies and in clinical practice. Although Pandemic influenza vaccine 
H5N1 AstraZeneca might increase wheezing in children aged 1 to 2 years, the risk is considered 
acceptable in a pandemic situation. Thus, the CHMP decided that the benefits of the medicine in 
children aged 1 to 18 years are greater than its risks and recommended that it be given marketing 
authorisation.  
Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca has been given ‘conditional approval’. This means that 
there is more evidence to come about the medicine, which the company is required to provide. Every 
year, the European Medicines Agency will review any new information that becomes available and this 
summary will be updated as necessary. 
What information is still awaited for Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 
AstraZeneca? 
Since Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca has been granted a conditional approval, the 
company that markets Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca will conduct studies to gather 
more information on its effectiveness and side effects during its use in a pandemic as well as its shelf 
life. 
What measures are being taken to ensure the safe and effective use of 
Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca? 
Recommendations and precautions to be followed by healthcare professionals and patients for the safe 
and effective use of Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca have been included in the summary 
of product characteristics and the package leaflet.

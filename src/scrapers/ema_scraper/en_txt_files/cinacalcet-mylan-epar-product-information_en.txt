Paediatric population 
Treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) in children aged 3 years and older with end-stage 
renal disease (ESRD) on maintenance dialysis therapy in whom secondary HPT is not adequately 
controlled with standard of care therapy (see section 4.4).  
Cinacalcet Mylan may be used as part of a therapeutic regimen including phosphate binders and/or 
vitamin D sterols, as appropriate (see section 5.1).  
Parathyroid carcinoma and primary hyperparathyroidism in adults  
Reduction of hypercalcaemia in adult patients with:  
• 
• 
parathyroid carcinoma.  
primary HPT for whom parathyroidectomy would be indicated on the basis of serum calcium 
levels (as defined by relevant treatment guidelines), but in whom parathyroidectomy is not 
clinically appropriate or is contraindicated. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Secondary hyperparathyroidism: 
Adults and elderly (> 65 years) 
The recommended starting dose for adults is 30 mg once per day. Cinacalcet should be titrated every 2 
to 4 weeks to a maximum dose of 180 mg once daily to achieve a target parathyroid hormone (PTH) in 
dialysis patients of between 150-300 pg/ml (15.9-31.8 pmol/l) in the intact PTH (iPTH) assay. PTH 
levels should be assessed at least 12 hours after dosing with cinacalcet. Reference should be made to 
current treatment guidelines.  
PTH should be measured 1 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose adjustment of cinacalcet. PTH should be 
monitored approximately every 1-3 months during maintenance. Either the intact PTH (iPTH) or bio-
intact PTH (biPTH) may be used to measure PTH levels; treatment with cinacalcet does not alter the 
relationship between iPTH and biPTH.  
Dose adjustment based on serum calcium levels 
Corrected serum calcium should be measured and monitored and should be at or above the lower limit 
of the normal range prior to administration of first dose of cinacalcet (see section 4.4). The normal 
calcium range may differ depending on the methods used by your local laboratory.  
During dose titration, serum calcium levels should be monitored frequently, and within 1 week of 
initiation or dose adjustment of cinacalcet. Once the maintenance dose has been established, serum 
calcium should be measured approximately monthly. In the event that corrected serum calcium levels 
fall below 8.4 mg/dl (2.1 mmol/l) and/or symptoms of hypocalcaemia occur the following 
management is recommended: 
Corrected Serum calcium level or clinical 
symptoms of hypocalcaemia
< 8.4 mg/dL (2.1 mmol/L) and > 7.5 mg/dL 
(1.9 mmol/L), or in the presence of clinical 
symptoms of hypocalcaemia  
< 8.4 mg/dL (2.1 mmol/L) and > 7.5 mg/dL 
(1.9 mmol/L) or persistent symptoms of 
3 
Recommendations 
Calcium-containing phosphate binders, 
vitamin D sterols and/or adjustment of dialysis 
fluid calcium concentrations can be used to 
raise serum calcium according to clinical 
judgment.  
Reduce or withhold dose of cinacalcet.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hypocalcaemia despite attempts to increase 
serum calcium  
≤ 7.5 mg/dL (1.9 mmol/L) or persistent 
symptoms of hypocalcaemia and vitamin D 
cannot be increased  
Withhold administration of cinacalcet until 
serum calcium levels reach 8.0 mg/dL 
(2.0 mmol/L) and/or symptoms of 
hypocalcaemia have resolved.  
Treatment should be reinitiated using the next 
lowest dose of cinacalcet.  
Paediatric population 
Corrected serum calcium should be in the upper range of, or above, the age-specified reference 
interval prior to administration of first dose of cinacalcet, and closely monitored (see section 4.4). The 
normal calcium range differs depending on the methods used by your local laboratory and the age of 
the child/patient.  
The recommended starting dose for children aged ≥ 3 years to < 18 years is ≤ 0.20 mg/kg once daily 
based on the patient’s dry weight (see table 1).  
The dose can be increased to achieve a desired target iPTH range. The dose should be increased 
sequentially through available dose levels (see table 1) no more frequently than every 4 weeks. The 
dose can be increased up to a maximum dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day, not to exceed a total daily dose of 
180 mg.

Children who require doses lower than 30 mg or who are unable to swallow tablets, should use other 
more suitable pharmaceutical forms of cinacalcet products.  
Dose adjustment based on PTH levels 
PTH levels should be assessed at least 12 hours after dosing with cinacalcet and iPTH should be 
measured 1 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose adjustment of cinacalcet. 
The dose should be adjusted based on iPTH as shown below: 
 
 
If iPTH is < 150 pg/mL (15.9 pmol/L) and ≥ 100 pg/mL (10.6 pmol/L), decrease the dose of 
cinacalcet to the next lower dose.  
If iPTH < 100 pg/mL (10.6 pmol/L), stop cinacalcet treatment, restart cinacalcet at the next 
lower dose once the iPTH is > 150 pg/mL (15.9 pmol/L). If cinacalcet treatment has been 
stopped for more than 14 days, restart at the recommended starting dose.  
Dose adjustment based on serum calcium levels 
Serum calcium should be measured within 1 week after initiation or dose adjustment of cinacalcet. 
Once the maintenance dose has been established, weekly measurement of serum calcium is 
recommended. Serum calcium levels in paediatric patients should be maintained within the normal 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
range. If serum calcium levels decrease below the normal range or symptoms of hypocalcaemia occur, 
appropriate dose adjustment steps should be taken as shown in table 2 below: 
Table 2. Dose adjustment in paediatric patients ≥ 3 to < 18 years of age 
Corrected Serum calcium value or clinical 
symptoms of hypocalcaemia 
Corrected serum calcium is at or below age-
specified lower limit of normal  
or 
if symptoms of hypocalcaemia occur, regardless 
of calcium level. 
Corrected total serum calcium is above age-
specified lower limit of normal, and 
Symptoms of hypocalcaemia have resolved. 
Dosing recommendations 
Stop treatment with cinacalcet. * 
Administer calcium supplements, calcium-
containing phosphate binders and/or vitamin D 
sterols, as clinically indicated. 
Restart at the next lower dose. If cinacalcet 
treatment has been stopped for more than 
14 days, restart at the recommended starting 
dose. 
If patient was receiving the lowest dose 
(1 mg/day) prior to discontinuation, restart at the 
same dose (1 mg/day).
*If the dose has been stopped, corrected serum calcium should be measured within 5 to 7 days 
The safety and efficacy of Cinacalcet Mylan in children aged less than 3 years for the treatment of 
secondary hyperparathyroidism have not been established. Insufficient data are available.  
Switch from etelcalcetide to Cinacalcet Mylan 
The switch from etelcalcetide to Cinacalcet Mylan and the appropriate wash out period has not been 
studied in patients. In patients who have discontinued etelcalcetide, Cinacalcet Mylan should not be 
initiated until at least three subsequent haemodialysis sessions have been completed, at which time 
serum calcium should be measured. Ensure serum calcium levels are within the normal range before 
Cinacalcet Mylan is initiated (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Parathyroid carcinoma and primary hyperparathyroidism: 
Adults and elderly (> 65 years) 
The recommended starting dose of Cinacalcet Mylan for adults is 30 mg twice per day. The dose of 
cinacalcet should be titrated every 2 to 4 weeks through sequential doses of 30 mg twice daily, 60 mg 
twice daily, 90 mg twice daily, and 90 mg three or four times daily as necessary to reduce serum 
calcium concentration to or below the upper limit of normal. The maximum dose used in clinical trials 
was 90 mg four times daily.  
Serum calcium should be measured within 1 week after initiation or dose adjustment of cinacalcet. 
Once maintenance dose levels have been established, serum calcium should be measured every 2 to 
3 months. After titration to the maximum dose of cinacalcet, serum calcium should be periodically 
monitored; if clinically relevant reductions in serum calcium are not maintained, discontinuation of 
cinacalcet therapy should be considered (see section 5.1).  
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of cinacalcet in children for the treatment of parathyroid carcinoma and 
primary hyperparathyroidism have not been established. No data are available. 
Hepatic impairment 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No change in starting dose is necessary. Cinacalcet should be used with caution in patients with 
moderate to severe hepatic impairment and treatment should be closely monitored during dose titration 
and continued treatment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  
Method of administration 
For oral use. 
Tablets should be taken whole and should not be chewed, crushed or divided. 
It is recommended that Cinacalcet Mylan be taken with food or shortly after a meal, as studies have 
shown that bioavailability of cinacalcet is increased when taken with food (see section 5.2).  
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Hypocalcaemia (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Serum calcium 
Life threatening events and fatal outcomes associated with hypocalcaemia have been reported in adult 
and paediatric patients treated with cinacalcet. Manifestations of hypocalcaemia may include 
paraesthesias, myalgias, cramping, tetany and convulsions. Decreases in serum calcium can also 
prolong the QT interval, potentially resulting in ventricular arrhythmia secondary to hypocalcaemia. 
Cases of QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia have been reported in patients treated with 
cinacalcet (see section 4.8). Caution is advised in patients with other risk factors for QT prolongation 
such as patients with known congenital long QT syndrome or patients receiving medicinal products 
known to cause QT prolongation.  
Since cinacalcet lowers serum calcium, patients should be monitored carefully for the occurrence of 
hypocalcaemia (see section 4.2). Serum calcium should be measured within 1 week after initiation or 
dose adjustment of cinacalcet. 
Adults 
Cinacalcet treatment should not be initiated in patients with a serum calcium (corrected for albumin) 
below the lower limit of the normal range.  
In Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients receiving dialysis who were administered cinacalcet, 
approximately 30% of patients had at least one serum calcium value less than 7.5 mg/dl (1.9 mmol/l).  
Paediatric population 
Cinacalcet Mylan should only be initiated for the treatment of secondary HPT in children ≥ 3 years old 
with ESRD on maintenance dialysis therapy, in whom secondary HPT is not adequately controlled 
with standard of care therapy, where serum calcium is in the upper range of, or above, the age-
specified reference interval.  
Closely monitor serum calcium levels (see section 4.2) and patient compliance during treatment with 
cinacalcet. Do not initiate cinacalcet or increase the dose if non-compliance is suspected.  
Prior to initiating cinacalcet and during treatment, consider the risks and benefits of treatment and the 
ability of the patient to comply with the recommendations to monitor and manage the risk of 
hypocalcaemia.   
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Inform paediatric patients and/or their caregivers about the symptoms of hypocalcaemia and about the 
importance of adherence to instructions about serum calcium monitoring, and posology and method of 
administration.  
CKD patients not on dialysis 
Cinacalcet is not indicated for CKD patients not on dialysis. Investigational studies have shown that 
CKD patients not on dialysis treated with cinacalcet have an increased risk for hypocalcaemia (serum 
calcium levels < 8.4 mg/dl [2.1 mmol/l]) compared with cinacalcet-treated CKD patients on dialysis, 
which may be due to lower baseline calcium levels and/or the presence of residual kidney function. 
Seizures  
Cases of seizures have been reported in patients treated with cinacalcet (see section 4.8). The threshold 
for seizures is lowered by significant reductions in serum calcium levels. Therefore, serum calcium 
levels should be closely monitored in patients receiving cinacalcet, particularly in patients with a 
history of a seizure disorder. 
Hypotension and/or worsening heart failure  
Cases of hypotension and/or worsening heart failure have been reported in patients with impaired 
cardiac function, in which a causal relationship to cinacalcet could not be completely excluded and 
may be mediated by reductions in serum calcium levels (see section 4.8). 
Co-administration with other medicinal products 
Administer cinacalcet with caution in patients receiving any other medicinal products known to lower 
serum calcium. Closely monitor serum calcium (see section 4.5). 
Patients receiving cinacalcet should not be given etelcalcetide. Concurrent administration may result 
in severe hypocalcaemia. 
General  
Adynamic bone disease may develop if PTH levels are chronically suppressed below approximately 
1.5 times the upper limit of normal with the iPTH assay. If PTH levels decrease below the 
recommended target range in patients treated with cinacalcet, the dose of cinacalcet and/or vitamin D 
sterols should be reduced or therapy discontinued.  
Testosterone levels  
Testosterone levels are often below the normal range in patients with end-stage renal disease. In a 
clinical study of adult ESRD patients on dialysis, free testosterone levels decreased by a median of 
31.3% in the cinacalcet-treated patients and by 16.3% in the placebo-treated patients after 6 months of 
treatment. An open-label extension of this study showed no further reductions in free and total 
testosterone concentrations over a period of 3 years in cinacalcet-treated patients. The clinical 
significance of these reductions in serum testosterone is unknown.  
Hepatic impairment  
Due to the potential for 2 to 4 fold higher plasma levels of cinacalcet in patients with moderate to 
severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification), cinacalcet should be used with caution in these 
patients and treatment should be closely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).   
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Medicinal products known to reduce serum calcium  
Concurrent administration of other medicinal products known to reduce serum calcium and cinacalcet 
may result in an increased risk of hypocalcaemia (see section 4.4). Patients receiving cinacalcet should 
not be given etelcalcetide (see section 4.4). 
Effect of other medicinal products on cinacalcet  
Cinacalcet is metabolised in part by the enzyme CYP3A4. Co-administration of 200 mg, twice daily 
ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, caused an approximate 2-fold increase in cinacalcet 
levels. Dose adjustment of cinacalcet may be required if a patient receiving cinacalcet initiates or 
discontinues therapy with a strong inhibitor (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, telithromycin, 
voriconazole, ritonavir) or inducer (e.g. rifampicin) of this enzyme.  
In vitro data indicate that cinacalcet is in part metabolised by CYP1A2. Smoking induces CYP1A2; 
the clearance of cinacalcet was observed to be 36-38% higher in smokers than non-smokers. The 
effect of CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g. fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) on cinacalcet plasma levels has not 
been studied. Dose adjustment may be necessary if a patient starts or stops smoking or when 
concomitant treatment with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is initiated or discontinued.  
Calcium carbonate 
Co-administration of calcium carbonate (single 1,500 mg dose) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of 
cinacalcet.  
Sevelamer 
Co-administration of sevelamer (2,400 mg, three times a day) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of 
cinacalcet.  
Pantoprazole 
Co-administration of pantoprazole (80 mg, once daily) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of 
cinacalcet.  
Effect of cinacalcet on other medicinal products  
Medicinal products metabolised by the enzyme P450 2D6 (CYP2D6): cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor 
of CYP2D6. Dose adjustments of concomitant medicinal products may be required when cinacalcet is 
administered with individually titrated, narrow therapeutic index substances that are predominantly 
metabolised by CYP2D6 (e.g. flecainide, propafenone, metoprolol, desipramine, nortriptyline, 
clomipramine).  
Desipramine 
Concurrent administration of 90 mg cinacalcet once daily with 50 mg desipramine, a tricyclic 
antidepressant metabolised primarily by CYP2D6, significantly increased desipramine exposure 3.6-
fold (90% CI 3.0, 4.4) in CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers.  
Dextromethorphan 
Multiple doses of 50 mg cinacalcet increased the AUC of 30 mg dextromethorphan (metabolised 
primarily by CYP2D6) by 11-fold in CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers. 
Warfarin 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Multiple oral doses of cinacalcet did not affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics (as 
measured by prothrombin time and clotting factor VII) of warfarin.  
The lack of effect of cinacalcet on the pharmacokinetics of R-and S-warfarin and the absence of auto-
induction upon multiple dosing in patients indicates that cinacalcet is not an inducer of CYP3A4, 
CYP1A2 or CYP2C9 in humans.  
Midazolam  
Co-administration of cinacalcet (90 mg) with orally administered midazolam (2 mg), a CYP3A4 and 
CYP3A5 substrate, did not alter the pharmacokinetics of midazolam. These data suggest that 
cinacalcet would not affect the pharmacokinetics of those classes of medicines that are metabolized by 
CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, such as certain immunosuppressants, including ciclosporin and tacrolimus.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no clinical data from the use of cinacalcet in pregnant women. Animal studies do not 
indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, parturition or postnatal development. No 
embryonal/foetal toxicities were seen in studies in pregnant rats and rabbits with the exception of 
decreased foetal body weights in rats at doses associated with maternal toxicities (see section 5.3). 
Cinacalcet Mylan should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential 
risk to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether cinacalcet is excreted in human milk. Cinacalcet is excreted in the milk of 
lactating rats with a high milk to plasma ratio. Following careful benefit/risk assessment, a decision 
should be made to discontinue either breast-feeding or treatment with Cinacalcet Mylan. 
Fertility 
There are no clinical data relating to the effect of cinacalcet on fertility. There were no effects on 
fertility in animal studies. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Cinacalcet may have major influence on the ability to drive and use machines, since dizziness and 
seizures have been reported by patients taking this medicinal product (see section 4.4). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Secondary hyperparathyroidism, parathyroid carcinoma and primary hyperparathyroidism 
Based on available data from patients receiving cinacalcet in placebo controlled studies and single-arm 
studies the most commonly reported adverse reactions were nausea and vomiting. Nausea and 
vomiting were mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature in the majority of patients. 
Discontinuation of therapy as a result of undesirable effects was mainly due to nausea and vomiting.

Description of selected adverse reactions  
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema and urticaria have been identified during post-
marketing use of cinacalcet. The frequencies of the individual preferred terms including angioedema 
and urticaria cannot be estimated from available data.

There have been reports of idiosyncratic cases of hypotension and/or worsening heart failure in 
cinacalcet-treated patients with impaired cardiac function in post-marketing safety surveillance, the 
frequencies of which cannot be estimated from available data.  
QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia secondary to hypocalcaemia 
QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia secondary to hypocalcaemia have been identified during 
post-marketing use of cinacalcet, the frequencies of which cannot be estimated from available data 
(see section 4.4).  
Paediatric population  
The safety of cinacalcet for the treatment of secondary HPT in paediatric patients with ESRD 
receiving dialysis was evaluated in two randomised controlled studies and one single-arm study (see 
section 5.1). Among all paediatric subjects exposed to cinacalcet in clinical studies a total of 
19 subjects (24.1%; 64.5 per 100 subject years) had at least one adverse event of hypocalcaemia. A 
fatal outcome was reported in a paediatric clinical trial patient with severe hypocalcaemia (see 
section 4.4). 
Cinacalcet Mylan should be used in paediatric patients only if the potential benefit justifies the 
potential risk. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.  
4.9  Overdose 
Doses titrated up to 300 mg once daily have been administered to adult patients receiving dialysis 
without adverse outcome. A daily dose of 3.9 mg/kg was prescribed to a paediatric patient receiving 
dialysis in a clinical study with subsequent mild stomach ache, nausea and vomiting. 
Overdose of cinacalcet may lead to hypocalcaemia. In the event of overdose, patients should be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of hypocalcaemia, and treatment should be symptomatic and 
supportive. Since cinacalcet is highly protein-bound, haemodialysis is not an effective treatment for 
overdose.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Calcium homeostasis, anti-parathyroid agents, ATC code: H05BX01 
Mechanism of action 
The calcium sensing receptor on the surface of the chief cell of the parathyroid gland is the principal 
regulator of PTH secretion. Cinacalcet is a calcimimetic agent which directly lowers PTH levels by 
increasing the sensitivity of the calcium sensing receptor to extracellular calcium. The reduction in 
PTH is associated with a concomitant decrease in serum calcium levels. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reductions in PTH levels correlate with cinacalcet concentration. 
After steady state is reached, serum calcium concentrations remain constant over the dosing interval. 
Secondary hyperparathyroidism 
Adults 
Three, 6 month, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies were conducted in ESRD patients 
with uncontrolled secondary HPT receiving dialysis (n=1,136). Demographic and baseline 
characteristics were representative of the dialysis patient population with secondary HPT. Mean 
baseline iPTH concentrations across the 3 studies were 733 and 683 pg/ml (77.8 and 72.4 pmol/l) for 
the cinacalcet and placebo groups, respectively. 66% of patients were receiving vitamin D sterols at 
study entry, and > 90% were receiving phosphate binders. Significant reductions in iPTH, serum 
calcium-phosphorus product (Ca x P), calcium, and phosphorus were observed in the cinacalcet 
treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients receiving standard care, and the results were 
consistent across the 3 studies. In each of the studies, the primary endpoint (proportion of patients with 
an iPTH ≤ 250 pg/ml (≤ 26.5 pmol/l)) was achieved by 41%, 46%, and 35% of patients receiving 
cinacalcet, compared with 4%, 7%, and 6% of patients receiving placebo. Approximately 60% of 
cinacalcet-treated patients achieved a ≥ 30% reduction in iPTH levels, and this effect was consistent 
across the spectrum of baseline iPTH levels. The mean reductions in serum Ca x P, calcium, and 
phosphorus were 14%, 7% and 8%, respectively.  
Reductions in iPTH and Ca x P were maintained for up to 12 months of treatment. Cinacalcet 
decreased iPTH and Ca x P, calcium and phosphorus levels regardless of baseline iPTH or Ca x P 
level, dialysis modality (PD versus HD), duration of dialysis, and whether or not vitamin D sterols 
were administered. 
Reductions in PTH were associated with non-significant reductions of bone metabolism markers (bone 
specific alkaline phosphatase, N-telopeptide, bone turnover and bone fibrosis). In post-hoc analyses of 
pooled data from 6 and 12 months clinical studies, Kaplan-Meier estimates of bone fracture and 
parathyroidectomy were lower in the cinacalcet group compared with the control group. 
Investigational studies in patients with CKD and secondary HPT not undergoing dialysis indicated that 
cinacalcet reduced PTH levels to a similar extent as in patients with ESRD and secondary HPT 
receiving dialysis. However, efficacy, safety, optimal doses and treatment targets have not been 
established in treatment of predialytic renal failure patients. These studies show that CKD patients not 
undergoing dialysis treated with cinacalcet have an increased risk for hypocalcaemia compared with 
cinacalcet-treated ESRD patients receiving dialysis, which may be due to lower baseline calcium 
levels and/or the presence of residual kidney function. 
EVOLVE (EValuation Of Cinacalcet Therapy to Lower CardioVascular Events) was a randomised, 
double-blind clinical study evaluating cinacalcet versus placebo for the reduction of the risk of all-
cause mortality and cardiovascular events in 3,883 patients with secondary HPT and CKD receiving 
dialysis. The study did not meet its primary objective of demonstrating a reduction in risk of all-cause 
mortality or cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction, hospitalisation for unstable angina, 
heart failure or peripheral vascular event (HR 0.93; 95% CI: 0.85, 1.02; p = 0.112). After adjusting for 
baseline characteristics in a secondary analysis, the HR for the primary composite endpoint was 0.88; 
95% CI: 0.79, 0.97. 
Paediatric population 
The efficacy and safety of cinacalcet for the treatment of secondary HPT in paediatric patients with 
ESRD receiving dialysis was evaluated in two randomised controlled studies and one single-arm 
study.

Study 1 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which 43 patients aged 6 to < 18 years were 
randomised to receive either cinacalcet (n = 22) or placebo (n = 21). The study consisted of a 24-week 
dose titration period followed by a 6-week efficacy assessment phase (EAP), and a 30-week open-
label extension. The mean age at baseline was 13 (range 6 to 18) years. The majority of patients (91%) 
were using vitamin D sterols at baseline. The mean (SD) iPTH concentrations at baseline were 
757.1 (440.1) pg/mL for the cinacalcet group and 795.8 (537.9) pg/mL for the placebo group. The 
mean (SD) corrected total serum calcium concentrations at baseline were 9.9 (0.5) mg/dL for the 
cinacalcet group and 9.9 (0.6) mg/dL for the placebo group. The mean maximum daily dose of 
cinacalcet was 1.0 mg/kg/day.  
The percentage of patients who achieved the primary endpoint (≥ 30% reduction from baseline in 
mean plasma iPTH during the EAP; weeks 25 to 30) was 55% in the cinacalcet group and 19.0% in 
the placebo group (p = 0.02). The mean serum calcium levels during the EAP were within the normal 
range for the cinacalcet treatment group. This study was terminated early due to a fatality with severe 
hypocalcaemia in the cinacalcet group (see section 4.8). 
Study 2 was an open-label study in which 55 patients aged 6 to < 18 years (mean 13 years) were 
randomised to receive either cinacalcet in addition to standard of care (SOC, n = 27) or SOC alone 
(n = 28). The majority of patients (75%) were using vitamin D sterols at baseline. The mean (SD) 
iPTH concentrations at baseline were 946 (635) pg/mL for the cinacalcet + SOC group and 
1228 (732) pg/mL for the SOC group. The mean (SD) corrected total serum calcium concentrations at 
baseline were 9.8 (0.6) mg/dL for the cinacalcet + SOC group and 9.8 (0.6) mg/dL for the SOC group. 
25 subjects received at least one dose of cinacalcet and the mean maximum daily dose of cinacalcet 
was 0.55 mg/kg/day. The study did not meet its primary endpoint (≥ 30% reduction from baseline in 
mean plasma iPTH during the EAP; weeks 17 to 20). Reduction of ≥ 30% from baseline in mean 
plasma iPTH during the EAP was achieved by 22% of patients in the cinacalcet + SOC group and 32% 
of patients in the SOC group.   
Study 3 was a 26-week, open-label, single-arm safety study in patients aged 8 months to < 6 years 
(mean age 3 years). Patients receiving concomitant medicinal products known to prolong the corrected 
QT interval were excluded from the study. The mean dry weight at baseline was 12 kg. The starting 
dose of cinacalcet was 0.20 mg/kg. The majority of patients (89%) were using vitamin D sterols at 
baseline. 
Seventeen patients received at least one dose of cinacalcet and 11 completed at least 12 weeks of 
treatment. None had corrected serum calcium < 8.4 mg/dL (2.1 mmol/L) for ages 2-5 years. iPTH 
concentrations from baseline were reduced by ≥ 30% in 71% (12 out of 17) of patients in the study 
Parathyroid carcinoma and primary hyperparathyroidism  
In one study, 46 adult patients (29 with parathyroid carcinoma and 17 with primary HPT and severe 
hypercalcaemia (who had failed or had contraindications to parathyroidectomy) received cinacalcet for 
up to 3 years (mean of 328 days for patients with parathyroid carcinoma and mean of 347 days for 
patients with primary HPT). Cinacalcet was administered at doses ranging from 30 mg twice daily to 
90 mg four times daily. The primary endpoint of the study was a reduction of serum calcium of ≥ 
1 mg/dl (≥ 0.25 mmol/l). In patients with parathyroid carcinoma, mean serum calcium declined from 
14.1 mg/dl to 12.4 mg/dl (3.5 mmol/l to 3.1 mmol/l), while in patients with primary HPT, serum 
calcium levels declined from 12.7 mg/dl to 10.4 mg/dl (3.2 mmol/l to 2.6 mmol/l). Eighteen (18) of 29 
patients (62%) with parathyroid carcinoma and 15 of 17 subjects (88%) with primary HPT achieved a 
reduction in serum calcium of ≥ 1 mg/dl (≥ 0.25 mmol/l).  
In a 28 week placebo-controlled study, 67 adult patients with primary HPT who met criteria for 
parathyroidectomy on the basis of corrected total serum calcium (> 11.3 mg/dl (2.82 mmol/l) but ≤ 
12.5 mg/dl (3.12 mmol/l), but who were unable to undergo parathyroidectomy were included. 
Cinacalcet was initiated at a dose of 30 mg twice daily and titrated to maintain a corrected total serum 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
calcium concentration within the normal range. A significantly higher percentage of cinacalcet treated 
patients achieved mean corrected total serum calcium concentration ≤ 10.3 mg/dl (2.57 mmol/l) and ≥ 
1 mg/dl (0.25 mmol/l) decrease from baseline in mean corrected total serum calcium concentration, 
when compared with the placebo treated patients (75.8% versus 0% and 84.8% versus 5.9% 
respectively). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
After oral administration of cinacalcet, maximum plasma cinacalcet concentration is achieved in 
approximately 2 to 6 hours. Based on between-study comparisons, the absolute bioavailability of 
cinacalcet in fasted subjects has been estimated to be about 20-25%. Administration of cinacalcet with 
food results in an approximate 50-80% increase in cinacalcet bioavailability. Increases in plasma 
cinacalcet concentration are similar, regardless of the fat content of the meal.  
At doses above 200 mg, the absorption was saturated probably due to poor solubility.  
Distribution  
The volume of distribution is high (approximately 1,000 litres), indicating extensive distribution. 
Cinacalcet is approximately 97% bound to plasma proteins and distributes minimally into red blood 
cells.  
After absorption, cinacalcet concentrations decline in a biphasic fashion with an initial half-life of 
approximately 6 hours and a terminal half-life of 30 to 40 hours. Steady state levels of cinacalcet are 
achieved within 7 days with minimal accumulation. The pharmacokinetics of cinacalcet does not 
change over time.  
Biotransformation  
Cinacalcet is metabolised by multiple enzymes, predominantly CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 (the 
contribution of CYP1A2 has not been characterised clinically). The major circulating metabolites are 
inactive.  
Based on in vitro data, cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6, but is neither an inhibitor of other 
CYP enzymes at concentrations achieved clinically, including CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 nor an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4.  
Elimination  
After administration of a 75 mg radiolabelled dose to healthy volunteers, cinacalcet was rapidly and 
extensively metabolised by oxidation followed by conjugation. Renal excretion of metabolites was the 
prevalent route of elimination of radioactivity. Approximately 80% of the dose was recovered in the 
urine and 15% in the faeces.  
Linearity/non-linearity  
The AUC and Cmax of cinacalcet increase approximately linearly over the dose range of 30 to 180 mg 
once daily.  
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships  
Soon after dosing, PTH begins to decrease until a nadir at approximately 2 to 6 hours post dose, 
corresponding with cinacalcet Cmax. Thereafter, as cinacalcet levels begin to decline, PTH levels 
increase until 12 hours post-dose, and then PTH suppression remains approximately constant to the 
end of the once-daily dosing interval. PTH levels in cinacalcet clinical trials were measured at the end 
of the dosing interval. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
There are no clinically relevant differences due to age in the pharmacokinetics of cinacalcet. 
Renal insufficiency 
The pharmacokinetic profile of cinacalcet in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal 
insufficiency, and those on haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is comparable to that in healthy 
volunteers. 
Hepatic insufficiency 
Mild hepatic impairment did not notably affect the pharmacokinetics of cinacalcet. Compared to 
subjects with normal liver function, average AUC of cinacalcet was approximately 2-fold higher in 
subjects with moderate impairment and approximately 4-fold higher in subjects with severe 
impairment. The mean half-life of cinacalcet is prolonged by 33% and 70% in patients with moderate 
and severe hepatic impairment, respectively. Protein binding of cinacalcet is not affected by impaired 
hepatic function. Because doses are titrated for each subject based on safety and efficacy parameters, 
no additional dose adjustment is necessary for subjects with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 
4.4). 
Gender 
Clearance of cinacalcet may be lower in women than in men. Because doses are titrated for each 
subject, no additional dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. 
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics of cinacalcet was studied in paediatric patients with ESRD receiving dialysis 
aged 3 to 17 years of age. After single and multiple once daily oral doses of cinacalcet, plasma 
cinacalcet concentrations (Cmax and AUC values after normalisation by dose and weight) were similar 
to those observed in adult patients.  
A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of demographic 
characteristics. This analysis showed no significant impact of age, sex, race, body surface area, and 
body weight on cinacalcet pharmacokinetics. 
Smoking  
Clearance of cinacalcet is higher in smokers than in non-smokers, likely due to induction of CYP1A2-
mediated metabolism. If a patient stops or starts smoking, cinacalcet plasma levels may change and 
dose adjustment may be necessary.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Cinacalcet was not teratogenic in rabbits when given at a dose of 0.4 times, on an AUC basis, the 
maximum human dose for secondary HPT (180 mg daily). The non-teratogenic dose in rats was 4.4 
times, on an AUC basis, the maximum dose for secondary HPT. There were no effects on fertility in 
males or females at exposures up to 4 times a human dose of 180 mg/day (safety margins in the small 
population of patients administered a maximum clinical dose of 360 mg daily would be approximately 
half those given above).  
In pregnant rats, there were slight decreases in body weight and food consumption at the highest dose. 
Decreased foetal weights were seen in rats at doses where dams had severe hypocalcaemia. Cinacalcet 
has been shown to cross the placental barrier in rabbits.  
Cinacalcet did not show any genotoxic or carcinogenic potential. Safety margins from the toxicology 
studies are small due to the dose-limiting hypocalcaemia observed in the animal models. Cataracts and 
lens opacities were observed in the repeat dose rodent toxicology and carcinogenicity studies, but were 
not observed in dogs or monkeys or in clinical studies where cataract formation was monitored. 
Cataracts are known to occur in rodents as a result of hypocalcaemia.  
In in vitro studies, IC50 values for the serotonin transporter and KATP channels were found to be 7 and 
12 fold greater, respectively, than the EC50 for the calcium-sensing receptor obtained under the same 
experimental conditions. The clinical relevance is unknown, however, the potential for cinacalcet to 
act on these secondary targets cannot be fully excluded. 
In toxicity studies in juvenile dogs, tremors secondary to decreased serum calcium, emesis, decreased 
body weight and body weight gain, decreased red cell mass, slight decreases in bone densitometry 
parameters, reversible widening of the growth plates of long bones, and histological lymphoid changes 
(restricted to the thoracic cavity and attributed to chronic emesis) were observed. All of these effects 
were seen at a systemic exposure, on an AUC basis, approximately equivalent to the exposure in 
patients at the maximum dose for secondary HPT.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Cinacalcet Mylan is and what it is used for 
Cinacalcet Mylan contains the active ingredient cinacalcet, which works by controlling the levels of 
parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium and phosphorous in your body. It is used to treat problems with 
organs called parathyroid glands. The parathyroids are four small glands in the neck, near the thyroid 
gland, that produce parathyroid hormone (PTH).  
Cinacalcet Mylan is used in adults:  
 
to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in adults with serious kidney disease who need dialysis 
to clear their blood of waste products  
to reduce high levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcaemia) in adult patients with parathyroid 
cancer  
to reduce high levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcaemia) in adult patients with primary 
hyperparathyroidism when removal of the parathyroid gland is not possible.  
 
 
Cinacalcet Mylan is used in children aged 3 years to less than 18 years of age:  
 
to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with serious kidney disease who need 
dialysis to clear their blood of waste products, whose condition is not controlled with other 
treatments. 
In primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism too much PTH is produced by the parathyroid glands. 
“Primary” means that the hyperparathyroidism is not caused by any other condition and “secondary” 
means that the hyperparathyroidism is caused by another condition, e.g. kidney disease. Both primary 
and secondary hyperparathyroidism can cause the loss of calcium in the bones, which can lead to bone 
pain and fractures, problems with blood and heart vessels, kidney stones, mental illness and coma. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Cinacalcet Mylan 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Do not take Cinacalcet Mylan  
 
if you are allergic to cinacalcet or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
 
if you have low levels of calcium in your blood. Your doctor will monitor your blood calcium 
levels. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Cinacalcet Mylan. 
Before you start taking Cinacalcet Mylan, tell your doctor if you have or have ever had:  
 
 
 
seizures (fits or convulsions). The risk of having seizures is higher if you have had them before;  
liver problems; 
heart failure.  
Cinacalcet Mylan reduces calcium levels. Life threatening events and fatal outcomes associated with 
low calcium levels (hypocalcaemia) have been reported in adults and children treated with cinacalcet.  
Please tell your doctor if you experience any of the following which may be signs of low calcium 
levels: spasms, twitches, or cramps in your muscles, or numbness or tingling in your fingers, toes or 
around your mouth or seizures, confusion or loss of consciousness while being treated with Cinacalcet 
Mylan. 
Low calcium levels can have an effect on your heart rhythm. Tell your doctor if you experience an 
unusually fast or pounding heartbeat, if you have heart rhythm problems, or if you take medicines 
known to cause heart rhythm problems, while taking Cinacalcet Mylan.

Children and adolescents 
Children under the age of 18 with parathyroid cancer or primary hyperparathyroidism must not take 
Cinacalcet Mylan.  
If you are being treated for secondary hyperparathyroidism, your doctor should monitor your calcium 
levels before starting treatment with Cinacalcet Mylan and during treatment with Cinacalcet Mylan.

above.

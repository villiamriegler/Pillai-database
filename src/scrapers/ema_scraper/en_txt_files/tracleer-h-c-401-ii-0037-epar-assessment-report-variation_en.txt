1. 
Introduction 
Tracleer  (bosentan)  is  an  endothelin  receptor  (ETA  and  ETB)  antagonist  and  thus  competes  with  the 
binding  of  ET-1  and  other  ET  peptides  to  both  ETA  and  ETB  receptors.  Bosentan  decreases  both 
pulmonary  and  systemic  vascular  resistance  resulting  in  increased  cardiac  output  without  increasing 
heart rate. 
The Marketing Authorisation of Tracleer was granted by the European Commission on 15 May 2002. 
Tracleer is currently indicated for: 
Treatment  of  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  (PAH)  to  improve  exercise  capacity  and  symptoms  in 
patients with grade III functional status. Efficacy has been shown in: 
•  primary PAH 
•  PAH secondary to scleroderma without significant interstitial pulmonary disease. 
•  PAH associated with congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts and Eisenmenger’s physiology  
Tracleer  is  also  indicated  to  reduce  the  number  of  new  digital  ulcers  in  patients  with  systemic 
sclerosis and ongoing digital ulcer disease. 
In  the  present  application,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  of  Tracleer  applied  for  an 
extension  of  indication  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  (PAH) 
categorised  as  WHO  functional  Class  II  with  subsequent  changes  in  sections  4.4,  4.8  and  5.1  of 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC). 
2. 
Clinical aspects 
Severity  of  the  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  is  usually  assessed  using  the  World  Health 
Organisation (WHO) classification of pulmonary hypertension as modified from the New York Heart 
Association functional classification. Four categories are defined according to the following criteria: 
Class I: 
Patients with pulmonary hypertension but without resulting limitation of physical activity. 
Ordinary  physical  activity  did  not  cause  undue  dyspnoea  or  fatigue,  chest  pain,  or  near 
syncope. 
Class II:  Patients  with  pulmonary  hypertension  resulting  in  slight  limitation  of  physical  activity. 
They  were  comfortable  at  rest.  Ordinary  physical  activity  caused  undue  dyspnoea  or 
fatigue, chest pain, or near syncope. 
Class III:  Patients with pulmonary hypertension resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. 
They  were  comfortable  at  rest.  Less  than  ordinary  activity  caused  undue  dyspnoea  or 
fatigue, chest pain, or near syncope. 
Class IV:  Patients  with  pulmonary  hypertension  with  inability  to  carry  out  any  physical  activity 
without symptoms. These patients manifested signs of right heart failure. Dyspnoea and/or 
fatigue  may  even  have  been  present  at  rest.  Discomfort  was  increased  by  any  physical 
activity. 
The efficacy and safety of bosentan for the treatment of moderately to severely symptomatic PAH was 
initially  shown  in  two  placebo-controlled  trials  conducted  in  patients  with  PAH  disease  of  WHO 
functional  class  III  and  IV.  In  both  studies,  bosentan  treatment  resulted  in  a  statistically  significant 
increase  in  the  6-minute  walk  distance  and  a  significant  delay  in  the  time  to  clinical  worsening, 
compared  with  placebo.  These  improvements  were  accompanied  by  a  decrease  in  patient-rated 
dyspnoea  during  exercise,  improved  functional  class  in  a  substantial  proportion  of  patients,  and 
improvements in cardiac haemodynamics.  
The marketing authorisation of Tracleer was based on the demonstration of a favourable benefit/risk 
ratio to improve exercise capacity and symptoms in patients with grade III functional status severity in 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
primary/familial pulmonary arterial hypertension, PAH secondary to scleroderma and PAH associated 
with congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts and Eisenmenger’s physiology. 
WHO Class I or II PAH patients have not been adequately studied in previous clinical trials. PAH is a 
rare disease, and only about 25% of PAH patients seen in the clinic are in functional class II or less at 
the time of diagnosis. 
In support of the present application to extend the indication in PAH patients with mildly symptomatic 
disease (WHO functional class II), the MAH has now submitted an additional clinical phase III study, 
the EARLY trial (Endothelin Antagonist Trial in Mildly Symptomatic PAH Patients, Study AC-052-
364). This study was designed to determine if initiating treatment with bosentan earlier in the course 
of the disease would not only affect haemodynamics and exercise capacity over a 6-month treatment 
period, but also delay clinical worsening. 
2.1 
Clinical efficacy 
2.1.1 
Pivotal study: Study AC-052-364 (EARLY) 
•  Methods 
Study  AC-052-364  (EARLY)  was  a  multicentre,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group, Phase IIIb study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of bosentan in patients with 
mildly  symptomatic  PAH  (WHO  functional  class  II).  The  study  was  conducted  in  a  total  of 
185 patients at 52 centres worldwide.  
The  primary  objectives  were  to  demonstrate  that  bosentan  improves  cardiac  haemodynamics  and 
exercise capacity in mildly symptomatic PAH patients. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the 
effect of bosentan on the time to clinical worsening; dyspnoea, WHO functional class, and quality of 
life;  and  to  demonstrate  that  bosentan  is  safe  and  well  tolerated  in  this  patient  population.  Further 
objectives were to evaluate the effects of bosentan on haemodynamics and exercise capacity in strata 
with or without concomitant sildenafil treatment at baseline. 
Study design 
The  study  design  is  described  in  Figure 1.  After  a  4-week  screening,  the  6  months  treatment  period 
consisted of an initial dosing phase (administration of bosentan 62.5 mg b.i.d. or matching placebo for 
4 weeks),  followed  by  a  target  dose  treatment  phase:  bosentan  125  mg  b.i.d.  for  patients  with  body 
weight  ≥40  kg  (62.5  mg  b.i.d.  for  patients  with  body  weight  <  40  kg)  or  matching  placebo  for 
5 additional months. Patients who did not tolerate the 125 mg b.i.d. target dose could be down titrated 
to the starting dose (62.5 mg b.i.d.).

Extension 
With the approval of sildenafil in the United States for the treatment of PAH (regardless of functional 
class), the study design was modified to allow up to 50% of patients to be on concomitant sildenafil at 
entry. Patients were stratified according to use or non-use of sildenafil at entry, with patients in each 
stratum randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive bosentan or placebo.   
Allowed  concomitant  treatments  for  PAH  included  calcium  channel  blockers  (if  present  for  at  least 
1 month  before  randomization  and  remained  constant  during  the  study),  sildenafil  (if  present  for  at 
least 2 months before randomization at a stable dose ≥ 20 mg three times daily and remained constant 
during the study), and anticoagulants.  
All patients who completed Period 1 were given the option of ending their participation in the study or 
switching  to  open-label  bosentan  until  the  study  was  ended  (Period  2).  The  main  objective  of  the 
open-label  treatment  period  was  to  collect  longer-term  safety  data.  During  Period  2,  the  dosing 
regimen  for  all  patients  was  to  be  the  initial  low  dose  of  bosentan  followed  by  up-titration  after 
1 month,  and  concomitant  PAH  therapy  was  allowed.  The  results  of  the double-blind  Period  1  were 
submitted in this application. Further to the request from the CHMP, a progress report on the open-
label extension was submitted by the MAH and is discussed in section 3.2.1.3. 
Study participants 
The main inclusion criteria were: 
−  Man  or  woman  ≥  12  years  of  age  (≥  18  years  in  Denmark,  Germany,  Ireland,  Norway, 
Sweden, and the United Kingdom). 
−  WHO  functional  class  II  PAH  (either  idiopathic/familial  (primary  pulmonary  hypertension), 
secondary  to  HIV,  secondary  to  intake  of  anorexigens,  secondary  to  atrial  septum  defect  of 
< 2 cm,  ventricular  septum  defect  of  <  1 cm  or  patent  ductus  arteriosus,  secondary  to 
connective tissue or autoimmune diseases). 
−  A 6-minute walk test distance < 80% of the normal predicted value or < 500 meters associated 
with a Borg dyspnoea index score of ≥ 2. 
−  Mean  pulmonary  artery  pressure  (mPAP)  ≥  25  mmHg  and  pulmonary  capillary  wedge 
pressure (PCWP) < 15 mmHg and PVR ≥ 320 dyn.sec.cm−5 at rest. 
Patients  were  excluded  if  they  had  significant  vasoreactivity  during  right  heart  catheterization  (i.e., 
could benefit from calcium channel blockers) or had PAH associated with other conditions or severe 
obstructive  lung  disease.  Patients  were  also  excluded  if  they  had  previously  received  treatment  for 
PAH  (except  calcium  channel  blockers,  sildenafil,  and  anticoagulants)  within  1  month  or  an  ET-

receptor antagonist or prostanoid (excluding acute administration during a catheterization procedure to 
test  vascular  reactivity)  within  3  months  of  randomization.  Other  exclusion  criteria  were  to  protect 
patient safety.  
Primary endpoints 
The efficacy of bosentan in class II patients was assessed using two co-primary endpoints sequentially:  
−  PVR at rest at Month 6 expressed as a percent of the baseline value.  
−  Change from baseline to Month 6 in 6-minute walk distance.  
Secondary endpoints 
−  Time to clinical worsening, defined as: 
o  Death (during treatment or as the outcome of a treatment-emergent adverse event that 
led to discontinuation of study treatment). 
o  Hospitalization due to PAH complications. 
o  Symptomatic  progression  of  PAH  (at  least  one  of  the  following:  Appearance  or 
worsening of right heart failure; ≥ 10% decrease from baseline in two 6-minute walk 
tests performed ≥ 2 weeks apart; ≥ 5% decrease from baseline in two 6-minute walk 
tests performed ≥ 2 weeks apart associated with a ≥ 2-point increase in Borg dyspnea 
index). 
−  Change from baseline to Month 6 in WHO functional class. 
−  Change from baseline to Month 6 in Borg dyspnoea index. 
−  Change  from  baseline  to  Month  6  in  mean  right  atrial  pressure  (mRAP),  mean  pulmonary 
artery  pressure  (mPAP),  cardiac  index,  TPR  and  mixed  venous oxygen  saturation  (SVO2)  at 
rest. 
Exploratory endpoints 
−  Change from baseline to Month 6 in B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentration. 
−  Change from baseline to Month 6 in percent change from value at rest to each workload level 
for mPAP, TPR, cardiac index, and SVO2 during exercise (cycle ergometry).  
−  Change  from  baseline  to  Month  6  in  mean  peripheral  oxygen  saturation  (SpO2),  time  to 
desaturation (as defined by a ≥ 4% decrease in SpO2), trough SpO2, and area under the curve 
during exercise (6-minute walk test). 
−  Change from baseline to Month 6 in mean heart rate during exercise (6-minute walk test). 
Safety endpoints 
Treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (AEs)  and  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  in  the  double-blind 
treatment period, clinical laboratory test results (i.e., changes from baseline to the end of double-blind 
treatment  period,  incidence  of  marked  and  special  laboratory  abnormalities),  and  changes  from 
baseline in vital signs and body weight up to 1 day after the end of double-blind treatment, premature 
discontinuation of double-blind treatment, and SAEs from 2 to 28 days after the end of double-blind 
treatment. 
Statistical methods 
With 85 patients per treatment group, a ≥ 20% reduction in the geometric mean PVR and a ≥ 35-meter 
increase in the mean 6-minute walk distance in the active vs placebo group could be determined with 
> 99% and 91% power, respectively. 
The two primary endpoints were  evaluated hierarchically, with the endpoint on walk distance tested 
only  if  the  endpoint  regarding  PVR  was  significant,  with  both  tested  at  a  two-sided  type-I  error  of 
0.05. The main analysis was on the all-randomized analysis set. 
Treatment  comparisons  were  performed  using  the  two-sided  Mann-Whitney  U-test  (main  analysis) 
and a two-sided t-test (secondary analysis). Similar analyses were performed using different analysis 
sets,  alternate  substitution  rules,  in  subgroups  of  the  study  population,  and  in  strata  with  or  without 
concomitant  sildenafil  treatment  at  baseline  (stratified  at  randomization).  Secondary  and  exploratory 
variables  were  analyzed  on  the  all-randomized  set  only,  with  exploratory  treatment  comparisons 
performed. After applying the substitution rules, data were summarized descriptively, using location 
5 
 
 
and  scale  statistics  and  frequency  counts  and  proportions.  Numerical  variables  were  analyzed  in  the 
same manner as the primary endpoints. The time to clinical worsening was analyzed using the Kaplan-
Meier  method,  with  treatment  effect  evaluated  using  the  hazard  ratio  (from  the  Cox  model)  of  the 
active  vs  placebo  group  and  tested  using  the  log-rank  test;  analyses  of  randomization  strata  and 
subgroups  were  similarly  performed.  The  proportions  of  patients  improved/worsened  in  functional 
class and SF-36 health transition index were compared using relative risk (active vs placebo) with the 
p-value from the Fisher exact test. 
Safety data were summarized descriptively, with time-to-event analyses performed using the Kaplan-
Meier method. 
Randomization 
Patients were randomized  to bosentan or placebo in a 1:1 ratio, with randomization stratified by the 
presence  or  absence  of  stable  sildenafil  therapy  at  baseline.  This  stratification  allowed  for  the 
additional objective of the evaluation of bosentan’s effects on hemodynamics and exercise capacity in 
resulting strata. 
Handling of missing values: Substitution rules 
Substitution rules to replace any missing assessments were in place before the study was unblinded. 
Missing values for either PVR or walk distance at Month 6 were replaced by carrying forward the last 
available  post-baseline  value  in  the  treatment  period  unless  the  patient  died  during  treatment, 
permanently  discontinued  due  to  an  adverse  event  which  resulted  in  death,  or  the  patient  remained 
alive but experienced clinical worsening during the treatment period. In these cases, the worst value 
was used to replace the missing value. 
Missing  values  for  other  hemodynamic  parameters  were  replaced  in  the  same  manner  as  for  PVR. 
Missing values at Month 6 for WHO functional class or Borg dyspnea index were replaced by carrying 
forward  the  last  available  post-baseline  value  in  the  treatment  period  unless  the  patient  experienced 
clinical worsening, in which case the worst value (the maximum value or if the patient died, class IV 
and score of 10, respectively) was used for the missing value. 
For  the  co-primary  endpoints,  robustness  analyses  were  performed  on  the  all-randomized  set,  using 
alternate  rules  for  imputation  of  missing  values  at  Month  6  (end  of  double-blind  treatment  period). 
Table 1 shows the criteria for inclusion of patients in these analyses.

Patients with a missing value at Month 6 for the primary endpoints are identified in the patient listings 
and are summarized in Table 2. The numbers of patients with missing values at Month 6 after applying 
the  substitution  rules  and  hence  missing  in  the  main  analysis  should  not  have  greatly  affected  the

The primary analysis did not include the cases with missing End of Study data in accordance with the 
pre-specified protocol. Further to the request from  the CHMP, the applicant clarified that except for 
one case with baseline missing PVR, the End of Study missing data were mainly due to adverse events 
leading to premature discontinuation and delay in End of Study assessment (in the period defined by 
the  protocol)  or  not  performed  if  judged  ethically  not  justified  (i.e.  treatment  exposure  too  short  to 
perform  a  end  of  treatment  invasive  right  heart  catheterisation).  The  applicant  provided  graphical 
presentations of analysis with alternative substitution rules applied to all randomised set (either with or 
without  worst  substitution).  The  presentation  showed  consistency  in  the  results  on  co-primary 
endpoint with the primary analysis. 
Demographics and baseline characteristics 
A  summary  table  describing  the  characteristics  of  patients  in  the  EARLY  study  and  in  the  pivotal 
registration  study  BREATHE-1  is  presented  below.  The  study  population  consisted  primarily  of 
Caucasian females and the mean age of subjects was 44 to 45 years. The two treatment groups were 
well balanced with regard to age, race, weight, and height. The placebo group had a higher proportion 
of males than did the bosentan group (37.0 % vs 23.7 %, respectively) (Table 3).

Within the group of patients with connective tissue disease, 9.7 % (9 patients) in the bosentan group 
and  5.4  %  (5  patients)  in  the  placebo  group  had  scleroderma.  The  HIV  patients  constituted  2.2  % 
(2 patients)  and  5.4  %  (5  patients)  in  the  placebo  and  bosentan  group,  respectively.  None  of  the 
enrolled patients had PAH associated with anorexigen use. The mean time from diagnosis was longest 
for the patients with congenital heart disease and shortest for patients with HIV etiology. Overall, the 
mean time from diagnosis to randomization was shorter among patients in the bosentan than placebo 
group (2.9 vs 3.7 years), regardless of etiology. However, median values often differed markedly from 
mean  values,  and  results  differed  among  analysis  sets.  This  high  variability  is  common  with  the 
difficult identification and lack of standard definition of the start of the disease. 
Overall, 15.7% of the study population was on sildenafil at baseline, and the stratification procedure 
resulted  in  balanced  treatment  groups  (14  patients on  sildenafil  in  the  bosentan  group  and  15  in  the 
placebo group).

Treatments  at  baseline  other  than  PAH  treatments  were  relatively  well  balanced  between  the  two 
treatment groups with the exception of the lower incidence of digoxin use (7.5% vs 17.4%) and the 
higher incidence of ethinylestradiol use (5.4% vs none) in the bosentan than placebo group. 
Baseline characteristics are summarised in the Table 4 below.

BREATHE-1 = Study AC-052-352, EARLY = Study AC-052-364, mPAP = mean pulmonary artery pressure, mRAP = mean 
right atrial pressure, PVR = pulmonary vascular resistance, SD =standard deviation. 
When compared with the functional class III and IV patients enrolled in the pivotal BREATHE-1 trial, 
patients  in  EARLY  were  clearly  different  with  regard  to  objective  functional measures.  At  baseline, 
the class II patients in EARLY were characterized by a greater 6-minute walk distance (6-MWD) and 
cardiac index and a lower  PVR and  mean right atrial pressure (mRAP) than seen in the class III/IV 
patients in BREATHE-1. Mean PAP was similar in both studies.  
Co-primary efficacy endpoint: Pulmonary Vascular Resistance (PVR)  
Results  from  the  main  analysis  of  the  co-primary  endpoint  on  PVR  demonstrated  a  statistically 
significant  22.6%  reduction  in  PVR  with  bosentan  compared  with  placebo  (95%  CL  −33.5,  −10.0, 
P < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney U-test) as shown in Table 5. After 6 months of treatment, mean PVR was 
decreased from baseline in the bosentan group (−69 ± 53 dyn.sec.cm-5, ± standard error (SEM)) and 
increased  in  the  placebo  group  (128  ±  50  dyn.sec.cm-5).  Similar  results  were  observed  in  all  other 
analyses as shown in the table below.

Baseline PVRs were similar between treatment groups in each stratum of the stratification factor (i.e., 
presence  or  absence  of  stable  sildenafil  therapy  at  baseline),  but  were  higher  in  patients  on 
concomitant sildenafil (1006 and 951 dyn.sec.cm-5 mean in bosentan and placebo groups, respectively) 
than  in  those  not  taking  sildenafil  (821  and  772  dyn.sec.cm-5,  respectively).  However,  the  bosentan 
treatment  effect  was  similar  in  the  two  subgroups  (−20.4%,  P = 0.0478  on  sildenafil  and  −23.1%, 
P < 0.0001  not  on  sildenafil;  Mann-Whitney  U-test).  The  treatment  effect  remained  statistically 
significant when adjusted for the stratification factor at randomization (p<0.0001 using van Elteren's 
test). 
Subgroup analyses defined by patient gender, age, disease aetiology, and baseline values for PVR and 
walk distance showed a consistent benefit with bosentan treatment in all subgroups analyzed (gender 
and age were planned, disease aetiology and baseline values for PVR and walk distance were added 
post-hoc, Figure 3). The placebo-corrected percent changes in PVR in subgroups ranged from −12.3% 
to −34.2%, with P < 0.05 (Mann-Whitney U-test) for all comparisons between treatments except in the 
small subgroups of patients with an aetiology other than idiopathic/familial PAH.

Further to the request from the CHMP, the MAH provided statistical analyses of PVR adjusted for the 
baseline  values  of  PVR  and  6-minute  walk  distance.  The  influence  of  the  stratification  factor  at 
randomization (presence/absence of sildenafil treatment at baseline), of selected covariates anticipated 
at blind in the statistical analysis plan (gender, age, pooled site), and of post-hoc selected covariates 
(aetiology,  baseline  6MWT  and  PVR)  on  treatment  effect  for  6MWT  and  PVR  was  explored  by 
introducing,  one  at  a  time,  each  of  the  quoted  variables  as  a  stratification  factor  in  a  stratified 
Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test.  
Similarly to the main analysis, the p-values resulting from adjusted statistical testing were < 0.0001, 
confirming  that  the  conclusions  of  the  study  are  not  sensitive  to  the  inclusion  of  the  selected 
covariates.

Co-primary efficacy endpoint: 6-minute walk test  
Because  a  statistically  significant  treatment  effect  was  observed  in  the  first  co-primary  endpoint 
regarding PVR, hypothesis testing for the second co-primary endpoint on 6-minute walk distance was 
undertaken. The comparison between treatments did not reach statistical significance (Median +13.8m, 
95% CL −1.4, 29.4, P = 0.0758, Mann-Whitney U-test).

An increase from baseline in walk distance with bosentan was observed at the Month-3 assessment 
(median +14.5m; 95% CL 5.0, 24.0), and the increase was maintained at the 6-month assessment. 
Figure 4 - Walk test: Change from baseline to Month 6, all-randomized set 
When  classifying  patients  according  to  the  stratification  factor  at  randomization,  after  6  months  of 
treatment, the median bosentan treatment effect was +5.0m for patients on sildenafil and +15.0m for 
those not on sildenafil at baseline (95% CL −43.1, 53.9, P = 0.8551 and 95% CL −1.6, 32.2, P=0.0795, 
respectively).  
In  subgroup  analyses  an  improved  median  walk  distance  with  bosentan  compared  with  placebo  was 
observed in most subgroups evaluated (Figure 5). An improved median walk distance with bosentan 
compared  with  placebo  reached  P  <  0.05  in  females,  patients  below  the  median  age  (42 years),  and 
patients with a baseline walk distance or PVR above the median (437 meters and 718 dyn.sec.cm-5).

As  requested  by  the  CHMP,  the  MAH  provided  statistical  analyses  of  the  6-minute  walk  distance 
adjusted for the baseline values of PVR and 6-minute walk distance. The influence of the stratification 
factor  at  randomization  (presence/absence  of  sildenafil  treatment  at  baseline),  of  selected  covariates

Secondary endpoint: Time to clinical worsening 
The time from treatment start to clinical worsening was the main secondary endpoint, and results over 
the  duration  of  double-blind  treatment  are  presented  in  Figure  6.  A  delay  in  the  time  to  clinical 
worsening  was  observed  with  bosentan  compared  with  placebo,  which  could  be  discerned  before 
16 weeks of treatment. The hazard ratio was 0.227, corresponding to a proportional risk reduction of 
77% (95% CI 20%–94%, P = 0.0114 log-rank test). 
Figure 6 - EARLY: Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to clinical worsening, all-randomized set 
As  with  the  co-primary  endpoints,  the  time  to  clinical  worsening  was  evaluated  in  strata  based  on 
sildenafil use at baseline and in a variety of subgroups of the all-randomized set (Figure 7).

The causes of clinical worsening are summarised in the table below. 
Table 9 - Summary of causes of clinical worsening, all-randomized set 
Out of the 12 patients in the placebo group that experienced symptomatic progression of PAH, three 
patients  had  increased  dyspnea  as  the  only  symptom  of  clinical  worsening.  Three  patients  presented 
with decreased 6-MWD. The remaining eight patients which presented with clinical symptoms were 
later  either  hospitalized  due  to  worsening  or  prematurely  discontinued  study  treatment  due  to 
worsening.  In  the  bosentan  treated  group,  one  of  the  patients  with  symptomatic  progression  was 
hospitalized and the other patient prematurely discontinued medication due to worsening of PAH. 
In addition, exploratory sensitivity analyses of clinical worsening were performed as follows: 
•  Analysis  excluding  events  in  4  worsening  patients  (3  on  placebo  and  1  on  bosentan) 
considered  by  post  hoc  expert  review  as  incomplete  or  not  convincing  enough  for  a  final 
diagnosis of clinical worsening. 
•  Analyses  excluding  symptomatic  progression,  using  alternative  definitions  of  worsening,  as 
follows: 
-  Death,  hospitalisation  due  to  PAH,  or  ≥  20%  decrease  from  baseline  in  6MWT, 
including all patients who stopped the walk test prematurely for any reason.  
-  Death,  hospitalisation  due  to  PAH,  or  ≥  20%  decrease  from  baseline  in  6MWT, 
excluding  patients  who  stopped  the  walk  test  prematurely  due  to  limitations  not 
associated with PAH. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
-  Death,  hospitalisation  due  to  PAH,  or  early  treatment  escape,  i.e.,  premature 
discontinuation of study drug due to PAH worsening. 
Results  of  these  sensitivity  analyses  and  of  the  analysis  predefined  in  the  protocol  are  presented  in 
Figure  8  below.  The  point  estimates  (hazard  ratios)  for  time  to  clinical  worsening  and  their  95% 
confidence boundaries were consistent across analyses.

Secondary endpoint: WHO functional class 
All patients were WHO class II at baseline and at Month 6 improvement to class I was observed in 
6.9% and 5.5% of bosentan- and placebo-treated patients, respectively (P = 0.7629). 3.4% of patients 
on  bosentan  worsened  to  class III  or  IV  compared  with  13.2%  of  patients  on  placebo  (P  =  0.0285, 
Fisher exact test). 
Secondary endpoint: Borg dyspnoea index 
The  small  increase  in  patient-rated  dyspnoea  in  the  placebo  group  and  the  small  decrease  with 
bosentan  treatment  resulted  in  a  mean  treatment  effect  of  –  0.4  on  the  Borg  scale  from  0  to 
12 (P= 0.2599, Mann-Whitney U-test). 
Secondary endpoint: haemodynamic parameters (mRAP, mean pulmonary artery pressure, SVO2) 
In addition to PVR, the haemodynamic variables mRAP, mPAP, TPR, cardiac index, and SVO2 were 
also evaluated at rest, and the changes from baseline to Month 6 analyzed. As with PVR, a treatment 
effect with bosentan compared with placebo was observed in each of the haemodynamic variables and 
in SVO2. The decreases in mPAP and TPR and the increases in cardiac index and SVO2 with bosentan 
were associated with P-values < 0.05 (Mann-Whitney U-test).  
Exploratory endpoint: BNP concentration 
BNP, a known biomarker of disease severity in PAH, was  measured in this study as an indicator of 
disease  progression.  During  double-blind  treatment,  a  small  mean  decrease  from  baseline  in  serum 
BNP concentration was observed with bosentan compared with a small mean increase with placebo, 
which  resulted  in  a  mean  −26  ng/L  (95%  CL  −79,  26)  and  median  −4  ng/L  (95%  CL  −23,  10) 
treatment effect (P = 0.4391, Mann-Whitney U-test). Due to the central laboratory’s concern about the 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
reliability of the BNP assay in serum, existing serum samples were reanalyzed using a validated assay 
for  N-terminal-pro-BNP,  the  more  stable  precursor  of  BNP.  As  with  BNP,  a  mean  decrease  was 
observed  with  bosentan  and  a  mean  increase  with  placebo,  resulting  in  mean  and  median  treatment 
effects  of  −471  ng/L  (95%  CL  −749,  −192)  and  −150  ng/L  (95%  CL  −289,  −61),  respectively 
(P = 0.0003, Mann-Whitney U-test).  
Exploratory endpoint: SF-36 questionnaire 
The  changes  in  patients’  quality  of  life  over  the  6-month  treatment  period  were  assessed  using  the 
generic  SF-36  questionnaire.  In  the  SF-36  domains,  higher  scores  indicate  a  better  condition,  and 
increases with bosentan compared with placebo were observed in all but the role emotional domain. 
The  changes  in  the  SF-36  health  transition  item  indicated  that  more  patients  on  bosentan  than  on 
placebo  felt  their  condition  had  improved  (57.3%  vs  38.3%;  relative  risk  1.5  (95%  CL  1.07,  2.10)). 
The proportion of patients reporting worsening in this domain did not differ between groups (18.7 % 
vs 18.5 % for bosentan and placebo, respectively). 
2.1.2 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Data from the two previously conducted phase III trials in class III/IV PAH (BREATHE-1, AC-051-
351) and from the EARLY trial in class II PAH were pooled to evaluate the efficacy of bosentan as 
assessed by the 6-minute walk test over a broad spectrum of PAH patients. The methods of analysis 
introduced for pooled data were also applied to the individual studies. 
The two treatment groups of the pool were well matched with regard to patient demographics except 
for  a  higher  proportion  of  females  in  the  bosentan  group  (76.7%  vs  71.5%  on  placebo,  with  a 
concomitantly  smaller  proportion  of  males),  which  was  due  to  the  imbalance  between  treatment 
groups  in  the  EARLY  trial.  Most  patients  of  “other”  race  were  Hispanic  (9  and  10  patients  in  the 
bosentan and placebo groups, respectively). Approximately 51% of patients in the pool were class II, 
46% class III, and 3% class IV at study entry. 
Results are presented in Figure 9 below.

2.1.3 
Open-label extension of EARLY study: Study AC-052-364-OL 
Further  to  a  request  for  supplementary  information  from  the  CHMP,  the  MAH  provided  a  progress 
report  on  the  open-label  extension  period  of  the  EARLY  study,  based  on  data  collected  as  of 
14 December 2007. 
Overall,  157  patients  were  enrolled  into  the  open-label  extension  to  the  EARLY  study,  out  of 
185 included  in  the  double-blind  phase.  The  main  reason  for  discontinuation  from  the  double-blind 
study and consequently not rolling over to the open-label extension was PAH worsening for placebo 
patients, and elevated LFTs for bosentan patients.  
The  following  exploratory  efficacy  and  safety  data  are  collected  during  the  open-label  treatment 
period:  6-monthly  assessments  of  the  6MWT  and  NYHA/WHO  functional  class,  new  PAH-specific 
treatments, reasons for premature discontinuation, AEs leading to discontinuation, occurrences of pre-
defined LFT and haemoglobin (Hb) changes.  
In the progress report submitted, summaries were provided for the data collected continuously, i.e., for 
all  parameters  except  new/concomitant  PAH-specific  treatment  and  occurrences  of  LFT/Hb  changes 
which will be collected only at study end.  
•  Exposure results 
Exposure data as per the cut-off date are given in Table 10. Data in patients randomized to bosentan 
cover a mean/median treatment duration of almost 2 years.

2.1.4 
Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria were adequate in selecting a less deteriorated group than studied 
in the previous trials, representative of the target population. Both primary endpoints of the EARLY 
study  have  been  used  in  previous  studies  on  bosentan  and  are  considered  relevant  endpoints  for 
evaluating treatment effect. 
A number of different substitution rules were  applied to handle missing data. The choice  of rules is 
judged  to  be  appropriate  and  sufficiently  conservative.  The  imputation  rules  for  handling  missing 
values seem to have been established in relation with the baseline value of the primary endpoints PVR 
and 6MWT, for which thresholds were part of the inclusion criteria. Despite that, some patients have 
been excluded from the main analysis, with a higher rate of patients excluded in the bosentan group 
than in the placebo group. However, the applicant provided graphical presentations of analyses with 
alternative substitution rules applied to all randomised sets (either with or without worst substitution). 
The presentation showed consistency in the results on co-primary endpoints with the main analysis. 
The  patients  enrolled  in  the  study  appear  to  be  representative  of  the  target  population.  No  apparent 
differences  were  seen  between  the  placebo  and  bosentan  groups  in  the  EARLY  study.  The  only 
exception is the higher percentage of males enrolled in the placebo group. This differs, not only from 
the bosentan group in the present study, but also from the previous BREATHE-1 trial. Furthermore, 
7 patients with PAH secondary to HIV were included in this study whereas PAH secondary to HIV is 
not an approved indication of Tracleer. The additional analyses on the co-primary endpoints conducted 
at the request of the CHMP, respectively excluding PAH-HIV patients and adjusting for pre-specified 
covariates including gender, showed results consistent with those of the main analysis. 
Results  of  the  EARLY  study  showed  a  statistically  significant  reduction  of  the  PVR  with  bosentan 
compared  to  placebo.  The  effect  was  of  similar  magnitude  as  compared  to  that  observed  in  studies 
with grade III populations. Changes in PVR are accepted as a marker of treatment effect in PAH and 
have been shown to be of prognostic importance.  
At baseline, mean and median values of the 6MWD were similar in the bosentan and placebo groups 
and  indicated  that  exercise  capacity  was  relatively  well  preserved  in  both  groups,  reflecting  grade 
II severity assessment. Based on the main analysis, no statistically significant effect was seen on the 
20 
 
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
6MWD between bosentan and placebo groups. Furthermore, the change in 6MWD remained under the 
threshold of clinically relevant improvement initially defined as > 35 meters.  
The MAH provided supplementary analyses of change in 6-MWD in different subgroups with variable 
cut off baseline 6MWD values: > and < median 437 meters; > and < 400 meters; > and < 450 meters. 
The analysis of 6MWD in patients with a baseline value > 400 meters, corresponding to 64% of the 
EARLY  study  population,  showed  a  clinically  relevant,  albeit  not  dramatic,  effect  of  approximately 
30 meters  with  borderline  statistical  significance.  The  consistency  of  the  findings  regarding  clinical 
worsening and WHO functional class transition further supports the robustness of the results. 
In the pooled analysis, the effect on exercise capacity (6MWD) is statistically significant due to the 
strong effect in the studies on patients in WHO class III-IV. All the point estimates are in favour of 
bosentan  treatment,  with  a  positive  trend  also  seen  in  patients  of  WHO  class  II.  However,  no 
conclusion can be drawn based on the available data.  
The  time  to  clinical  worsening  was  used  as  a  secondary  endpoint  in  this  study.  The  definition  of 
clinical worsening is somewhat different to the one used in the previous studies and was adjusted to 
better fit the less deteriorated subjects in the target group. This endpoint is a composite of objective 
and  subjective  variables  which  is  debatable  as  it  highly  depends  on  investigator  assessment. 
Especially,  the  evaluation  of  worsening  of  right  heart  failure  could  be  difficult  to  standardise.  An 
effect on the time to worsening in favour of bosentan was observed in the subgroup analysis, although 
not statistically significant (except for patients not treated with sildenafil and for females). The number 
of  events  is  low  and  a  longer  observation  time  would  have  been  preferable.  Only  weak  differences 
were  observed,  driven  by  symptomatic  criteria  relating  to  functional  capacity.  The  use  of  ‘soft’ 
symptoms and signs to characterise an outcome is of course debatable. However, when reviewing the 
data of the individual patients, it appears that the results in clinical worsening are clinically relevant 
since the first symptomatic event of clinical worsening in most cases was associated with or followed 
by  more  severe  events.  The  analysis  made  by  the  MAH,  using  alternative  definitions  of  clinical 
worsening  resulted  in  consistent  findings.  This  supports  the  assumption  that  the  results  on  clinical 
worsening are robust and clinically relevant. 
There was one hospitalisation related to PAH worsening in the bosentan group and 3 hospitalisations 
in  the  placebo  group.  Only  one  death  occurred  in  each  treatment  group  during  the  6-month  double-
blind study period, therefore no conclusion can be drawn on survival. 
The use of a supportive endpoint such as change in function in WHO class is adequate and clinically 
relevant. However, it is subject to variability depending on the investigator assessment and despite the 
clarifications  from  the  MAH  on  missing  values,  it  cannot  be  recognized  as  a  robust  criterion  for 
assessment of efficacy. 
The change in Borg dyspnoea class (which is a more objective parameter) as a supportive secondary 
endpoint does not add  much to the information since  this is already included in the  main secondary 
endpoint. 
The  supportive  data  on  quality  of  life  tend  to  be  in  favour  of  bosentan  treatment,  however,  not 
statistically significant. The results observed are in line with the improvement in symptoms but do not 
support any other claim. 
The  open-label  extension  data  currently  are  in  favour  of  the  maintenance  of  the  treatment  effect  of 
bosentan in functional class II PAH after one year.

Clinical safety 
2.2.1 
Study AC-052-364 (EARLY) safety results  
• 
Patient exposure 
The safety population used in the analysis included all 185 randomised patients. Patients were to be 
treated  for  at  least  6  months  and  were  exposed  to  bosentan  treatment  for  a  mean  of  27.9  weeks 
(median 26.1 weeks) and up to 74.0 weeks. The duration of treatment was similar for those patients on 
placebo  (mean  26.8  weeks,  median  26.1  weeks).  All  safety  data  collected  during  double-blind 
treatment, regardless of duration, were included in the analysis. 
The exposure to study treatment was quite similar in the two treatment groups, with 86.0% and 88.0% 
of  patients  receiving  a  full  24  weeks  of  bosentan  and  placebo  treatment,  respectively.  Because  the 
original study design continued double-blind treatment after the Month-6 visit, some patients received 
up to 74 weeks of double-blind treatment. 
The  majority  of  patients  were  treated  per  protocol  and  the  mean  daily  dose  did  not  differ  between 
treatment groups (224 and 221 mg daily for the placebo and bosentan group, respectively). 
•  Adverse events 
An overview of the AEs that occurred during the double-blind treatment period shows that, in general, 
the incidence of AEs was similar in the two treatment groups (Table 13). 
Most events were considered by the investigator to be unrelated to study treatment. Only 33.3% and 
28.3% of patients on bosentan and placebo, respectively, experienced an AE considered to be related 
to study drug. The events that were most often considered related to study treatment in both treatment 
groups were those known to be associated with bosentan therapy, including investigations denoting an 
elevation  in  liver  aminotransferases  or  decrease  in  haemoglobin  concentration,  vascular  disorders 
(e.g., flushing), headache, and peripheral oedema.

All AEs with an overall bosentan incidence < 5% are pooled under 'Other'. 
AE = adverse event. 
At  least  one  AE  was  reported  for  69.9%  and  65.2%  of  bosentan-  and  placebo-treated  patients, 
respectively. The most frequent events in the bosentan group were nasopharyngitis (7.5% vs 8.7% in 
the placebo group) and an abnormal liver function test (7.5% vs 3.3%), and that in the placebo group 
was  headache  (9.8%  vs  4.3%  in  the  bosentan  group).  Because  of  an  association  with  bosentan 
treatment,  events  that  could  denote  an  elevation  in  liver  enzymes,  decreased  haemoglobin 
concentration,  or  oedema  were  summarized  together  to  obtain  a  better  estimate  of  these  adverse 
experiences.  In  this  combined  analysis,  events  denoting  elevated  liver  enzymes  were  more  frequent 
with  bosentan  than  placebo  (11.8%  vs  6.5%),  as  were  events  denoting  a  decrease  in  haemoglobin 
(6.5% vs 3.3%). The incidences of events denoting oedema were similar in the two treatment groups 
(9.7% and 9.8% with bosentan and placebo, respectively) as was the individual component event of 
peripheral oedema (6.5% and 7.6%, respectively). 
Individual  events  that  were  more  frequent  on  placebo  than  bosentan  (≥  4%  difference)  included 
pulmonary hypertension, headache, diarrhoea, rhinitis, upper abdominal pain, and dyspepsia. 
Nine patients in each treatment group had study treatment discontinued because of a variety of adverse 
events.  An  event  denoting  abnormal  liver  function  led  to  the discontinuation  of  six  bosentan-treated 
patients  (6.5%  vs  none  on  placebo),  and  pulmonary  hypertension  led  to  the  discontinuation  of  five 
placebo-treated patients (5.4% vs 1.1% on bosentan).  
• 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Deaths 
Only  deaths  that  occurred  on  double-blind  treatment  or  were  the  outcome  of  a  treatment-emergent 
event that led to the permanent discontinuation of double-blind treatment were reported for Period 1 of 
the study. Two such events occurred, one in each treatment group.  
One patient in the bosentan group died on Day 101 while on double-blind treatment. The sudden death 
(following  a  fall  with  subsequent  headache)  was  possibly  due  to  the  underlying  disease, 
antiphospholipid syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus, but an autopsy was not performed. The 
investigator considered the events to be related to study treatment and to sildenafil treatment.  
One  patient  in  the  placebo  group  experienced  the  SAEs  of  respiratory  failure  and  spinal  cord 
hemorrhage  on  Day  27,  was  hospitalized  and  discontinued  study  treatment.  Despite  the  investigator 
breaking  the  treatment  blind  to  better  evaluate  the  event  and  an  emergency  operation,  the  patient 
continued to deteriorate and died on Day 31. The investigator judged these events to be unrelated to 
study treatment.  
23 
  
 
Serious adverse events 
Serious  adverse  events  were  experienced  by  12.9%  and  8.7%  of  bosentan-  and  placebo-treated 
patients, respectively. No individual SAE was reported by more than two patients in either treatment 
group. Events reported by two patients included syncope in bosentan-treated patients and pulmonary 
arterial hypertension and right ventricular failure in placebo-treated patients. 
One  patient  on  bosentan  had  a  history  of  CREST  syndrome  and  was  diagnosed  with  autoimmune 
hepatitis  and  hepatic  cirrhosis,  which  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  unrelated  to  study 
treatment. Clinical features and laboratory abnormalities already present at baseline were suggestive of 
pre-existing liver disease. On the day of completion, the patient had an AE of abnormal liver function 
test, which was judged by the investigator to be serious and related to study treatment. Consequently, 
open-label bosentan treatment was not started as planned, and the abnormality resolved.  
A  similar  proportion  of  patients  in  both  bosentan  and  placebo  groups  had  double-blind  treatment 
permanently discontinued because of an AE (9.7% and 9.8%, respectively). 
One of the 28 patients who permanently discontinued study treatment (either prematurely or at the end 
of  the  double-blind  treatment  period)  and  were  followed  for  28  days  post  treatment  experienced  an 
SAE during the safety follow-up. The patient (placebo) was hospitalized with menorrhagia during the 
study,  and  6  days  after  completing  the  double-blind  treatment  period,  she  had  a  hysterectomy  and 
oophorectomy. The events resolved without sequelae and were not considered by the investigator to be 
related to study treatment.  
In  addition,  one  patient  (placebo)  had  a  positive  pregnancy  test  on  Day  34  of  the  study,  with 
conception  estimated  on  Day −11  and  a  missed  abortion  diagnosed  on  Day  35.  The  events  resolved 
without sequelae and were judged by the investigator to be not related to study treatment. 
•  Laboratory findings 
The  incidences  of  marked  laboratory  abnormalities  are  summarized  in  Table  15.  The  incidences  of 
marked  decrease  in  hemoglobin  concentration  and  marked  increases  in  ALT  and  AST  were  greater 
with bosentan than with placebo.

(2.2%)  on  placebo.  Among  bosentan-treated  patients,  the  increase  in  ALT  and/or  AST  was  to 
24 
 
  
  
  
  
 
> 8 × ULN in five patients. The elevations were asymptomatic in all cases. There was one case of an 
additional  liver  abnormality  in  a  patient  who  had  an  associated  increase  in  alkaline  phosphatase  to 
> 3 × ULN.  
Most of the elevations first appeared during the first 20 weeks of bosentan treatment, although in one 
case (patient with autoimmune hepatitis), the elevation first appeared after 67 weeks of treatment. 
The two cases with hepatitis (one with autoimmune hepatitis and one with hepatitis C) were SAEs and 
for  the  patient  with  hepatitis  C,  hospitalization  was  required.  With  this  exception,  none  of  the 
elevations  in  liver  enzymes  led  to  hospitalization,  liver  transplant,  or  death  during  the  double-blind 
treatment period.  
A decrease in haemoglobin concentration to < 75% of the lower limit of normal (LLN) was observed 
in  five  (5.4%)  patients  on  bosentan  and  none  on  placebo.  Two  patients  on  bosentan  with  a  marked 
decrease  in  haematocrit  also  had  a  marked  decrease  in  haemoglobin  concentration.  Few  marked 
abnormalities in other haematology and clinical chemistry variables were observed in either treatment 
group. 
2.2.2 
Open-label extension of EARLY study: Study AC-052-364-OL 
Overall,  157  patients  were  enrolled  into  the  open-label  extension  to  the  EARLY  study,  out  of 
185 included  in  the  double-blind  phase.  The  main  reason  for  discontinuation  from  the  double-blind 
study and consequently not rolling over to the open-label extension was PAH worsening for placebo 
patients,  and  elevated  LFTs  for  bosentan  patients.  Exposure  data  as  per  the  cut-off  date  of 
14 December 2007 are presented in Table 10 above. 
•  Deaths and other SAEs 
Forty-four (44) SAEs (8 related, 36 not related) were reported to Actelion Global Drug Safety during 
the  open-label  extension  period  of  the  EARLY  study  (from  the  start  of  the  open-label  study  up  to 
20 December 2007). A fatal outcome was reported in 9 patients (5 previously exposed to placebo and 
4 to bosentan; 2 from related cases and 7 from unrelated cases). Of the 5 ex-placebo patients, 4 died 
due to or in association with possible worsening of the underlying disease.  
With  the  exception  of  a  suspected  allergic  reaction  to  allopurinol,  the  spectrum  of  events  seen  is 
consistent with the nature of the clinical progression of this severe underlying disease and associated 
conditions and the known safety profile of bosentan as established in the pivotal clinical trials and in 
the post marketing experience.   
• 
Premature study treatment discontinuation 
Overall  34  patients  (19.7%)  discontinued  open-label  study  treatment,  16  (20%)  ex-placebo  and 
18 (19.4%) ex-bosentan patients. The most frequent reason for premature discontinuation was an AE 
other  than  PAH  (12.5  and  9.7%,  respectively)  and  death  of  any  cause  (5%  and  3.2%,  respectively).

2.2.3 
Overall clinical trial and post-marketing experience with Tracleer 
The  safety  profile  of  bosentan  in  the  EARLY  study  in  WHO  functional  class  II  PAH  patients  was 
consistent with that demonstrated in class III and IV PAH patients in the pivotal registration trials for 
Tracleer, as well as with what has been documented for bosentan in trials in other indications.  
Accordingly,  the  long-term  safety  and,  especially,  the  long-term  hepatic  safety  of  Tracleer  is  an 
important issue. Data on this are available from clinical trials and post-marketing use. 
•  Clinical trial experience 
The longest-term, placebo-controlled clinical trials with bosentan were the AC-052-301/302 ENABLE 
studies  in  804  bosentan-treated  patients  with  congestive  heart  failure,  in  which  most  patients  were 
treated with bosentan 125 mg b.i.d. for at least 1 year (mean duration of exposure 68.7 weeks, median 
exposure  78.4  weeks).  These  studies  did  not  provide  indications  of  increasing  liver  toxicity  of 
bosentan over time of exposure.  
In placebo-controlled trials, elevations reaching at least 3 × ULN have been observed in about 10% to 
14% of patients, generally within the first 26 weeks of therapy.  
As  currently  stated  in  the  SPC,  liver  enzyme  changes  typically  occur  within  the  first  26  weeks  of 
treatment.  In  a  few  cases  they  may  also  occur  late  in  treatment,  as  reported  in  post-marketing 
experience and as reflected in the section 4.8 of the approved SPC. 
• 
Post-marketing experience 
Data are available to reflect the experience with Tracleer in approximately 55,000 patients who have 
been  exposed  to  bosentan  between  20  November  2001  and  19  November  2007.  Data  of  particular 
interest are available from surveillance programmes, the Tracleer Post-marketing Surveillance (PMS) 
in the EU, and the Tracleer Access Program (T.A.P.) in the USA. 
Tracleer PMS  
In  the  EU,  the  Tracleer PMS  database  gathered  solicited  adverse  drug  reaction  (ADR)  data  from 
4,994 patients with a mean exposure time of 38.6 weeks. Of these 4,994 patients, 4,623 were naïve to 
bosentan at the time of database  entry, and 11.8% were reported  as having WHO/NYHA functional 
26 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
class II PAH. The data from this source corroborate the findings from the EARLY study in patients 
with  functional  class  II  PAH  that  the  risk  for  hepatotoxicity,  as  assessed  by  the  incidence  of  LFT 
elevations, is not higher than that in patients within WHO/NYHA functional class III or IV.  
T.A.P. program in the USA 
In  order  to  ascertain  whether  there  was  any  increased  risk  over  time  of  liver  function  abnormalities 
occurring in patients who take Tracleer, data from the Actelion global drug safety database regarding 
US Tracleer patients was reviewed. The results showed that patients in the first 6 months of exposure 
were more likely to have a liver event (8% of patients) than those who were exposed for 6 years (2% 
of  exposed  patients).  The  results  do  not  provide  information  as  to  how  many  patients  discontinued 
Tracleer as a result of their liver event.  
Overall, the data support the conclusion that within the US exposure of 28,679 patients over the last 
6 years,  1,920  or  7%,  had  a  liver  event  reported  to  Actelion  GDS,  and  that  the  chance  of  this 
happening was higher in the first 6 months of use, and gradually went down over time. 
2.2.4 
Discussion on clinical safety  
During the EARLY Study, the majority of patients were treated according to the protocol and reached 
the target dose. No new safety concerns were observed from these data. Safety findings with bosentan 
during  the  double-blind  treatment  period  were  similar  to  those  previously  observed  with  bosentan. 
Elevated liver enzymes and anaemia, which are well known side effects of bosentan, were seen more 
frequently in the bosentan treated group, whereas worsening of PAH was more frequently seen in the 
placebo group.  
There is no apparent difference in the risk of hepatic side effects in the grade II population compared 
to  patients  with  grade  III  functional  status.  As  described  by  the  MAH,  the  majority  of  hepatic  AEs 
appear within the first six months of treatment and their incidence then decreases.  
Data  currently  available  from  the  ongoing  open-label  extension  to  the  EARLY  study  show  no  new 
safety  concerns  with  bosentan.  Clinically  relevant  elevations  in  liver  enzymes  were  of  expected 
frequency and were all manageable. Deaths associated with PAH worsening, already observed within 
4 months into the open-label extension, were more frequent in patients previously exposed to placebo 
(4)  than  treated  with  bosentan  (2).  These  deaths  confirm  the  serious  prognosis  of  WHO  functional 
class II PAH patients despite initial presentation with mild symptoms.  
The experience from treatment of functional class III patients has shown that the hepatic events can be 
managed by repeated control of liver function tests as part of the risk management plan and could be 
handled  in  a  safe  way.  Furthermore,  elevated  liver  values  have  been  shown  to  normalise  after 
discontinuation of therapy.  
The MAH committed to prolong the open-label extension to the EARLY study until at least half of the 
randomised  patients  have  been  followed  for  five  years.  Data  on  several  outcomes  (death, 
transplantation, atrial septostomy, start of intravenous or subcutaneous prostanoids) will be collected 
in addition to safety and exploratory efficacy information. Annual progress reports will be submitted 
to the CHMP. The Final study report will be submitted as soon as available.

The current risk minimisation activities described in the conditions or restrictions with regard to the 
safe and effective use of the medicinal product in Annex II of the Product information are considered 
adequate for the proposed extension of indication. 
However, as a follow-up measure, the RMP should be revised with the next PSUR to take into account 
the following comments: 
−  The post-marketing experience section should be updated in accordance with the EU template. 
−  Data  on  patients  exposed  in  the  post  marketing  setting  should  be  provided,  if  possible,  for 
each indication and broken down into EU country or sales area. 
−  The  applicant  should  make  efforts  to  better  present  the  data  on  pregnancies  and  try  to 
document  as  often  as  possible  information  on  the  root  of  contraception  failure  through  the 
pregnancy reporting forms implemented. These forms should also be appended to the RMP. 
−  The  Pregnancy  Action  Plan  appended  to  the  RMP  should  be  updated  in  accordance  to  the 
conclusions from the CHMP during procedure II/34.

Orphan Medicinal Products 
Bosentan  was  granted  an  orphan  designation  (EU/3/01/019)  by  the  European  Commission  on 
14 February  2001  for  the  treatment  of  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  and  chronic  thromboembolic 
pulmonary hypertension.  
Due  to  the  overlap  of  the  extension  of  indication  in  PAH  WHO  functional  class  II  proposed  by  the 
MAH of Tracleer with that approved for Volibris (ambrisentan), the MAH was requested to submit a 
critical report addressing the possible similarity with this authorised orphan medicinal product. 
Having considered the arguments presented by the MAH of Tracleer on 18 April 2008, it is concluded 
that  bosentan  and  ambrisentan  do  not  share  the  same  principal  molecular  structural  features  and  the 
differences in molecular structure are not only minor. Bosentan is regarded as structurally not similar 
to  ambrisentan.  As  defined  in  Art.  3  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No  847/2000),  Tracleer  and 
Volibris are considered as non-similar. 
Therefore, with reference to article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000, the existence of any market 
exclusivity  for  Volibris  in  Pulmonary  Hypertension  (PAH)  including  WHO  functional  class  II,  does 
not  prevent  the  granting  of  the  extension  of  indication  of  Tracleer  in  PAH  WHO  functional  class  II 
which can be considered as significantly overlapping with the indication approved for Volibris. This 
finding is without prejudice to the outcome of the scientific assessment of the extension of indication 
application. 
5. 
Benefit-Risk Assessment 
Pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  is  a  rare  disease,  and  only  about  25%  of  PAH  patients  seen  in  the 
clinic are in functional class II or less at the time of diagnosis. PAH is a serious progressive disease 
with  a  mean  survival  of  3.5  years  in  WHO  Class  II-III,  4.9  years  in  WHO  Class  I/II.  There  is  no 
available cure but lung transplantation. Available pharmacological treatment aims at providing relief 
of  symptoms  and  to  maintain  productivity  and  quality  of  life.  Another  aspect  of  pharmacological 
treatment is to delay clinical worsening. 
The EARLY trial was designed to evaluate treatment effects in PAH patients with mildly symptomatic 
disease  (WHO  functional  class  II).  The  objectives  were  to  determine  if  initiating  treatment  with 
bosentan  earlier  in  the  course  of  the  disease  would  not  only  affect  haemodynamics  and  exercise 
capacity  over  a  6-month  treatment  period,  but  also  delay  clinical  worsening.  The  study  managed  to 
recruit  a  representative  group  of  patients  with  clinical  and  objective  findings  characteristic  of  WHO 
functional  class  II.  The  chosen  endpoints  have  previously  been  used  to  evaluate  the  effects  of 
treatment of PAH and they are well established.  
Based  on  the  main  analysis,  no  statistically  significant  effect  was  seen  on  the  6MWD  between 
bosentan  and  placebo  groups.  Furthermore,  the  change  in  6MWD  remained  under  the  threshold  of 
clinically  relevant  improvement  initially  defined  as  >  35  meters.  Therefore,  the  results  are  not 
sufficient to grant an indication to improve exercise capacity.  
However,  a  significant  effect  on  PVR  has  been  convincingly  shown  in  the  submitted  study  and  the 
effect  was  of  the  similar  magnitude  to  that  observed  in  studies  with  grade  III  populations.  The 
magnitude of the effects is therefore judged to be relevant and is supported by the observed effects on 
exercise  capacity,  clinical  symptoms  worsening  and  functional  status  improvement,  although  they 
were not as statistically convincing as the haemodynamic results. Therefore, it can be concluded that 
some improvements have also been shown in patients with PAH grade II functional status treated with 
Tracleer. 
No  new  safety  concerns  were  raised  during  the  EARLY  study.  Since  the  target  population  is  rather 
young and would be exposed to the drug for a longer time, the safety aspects are important. Severe 
adverse reactions would be more difficult to accept in a population that is less severely affected by the 
disease.  The  severe  adverse  effects  are,  however,  well  known  and  could  be  dealt  with  through  the 
current recommendations in the product information and risk management plan.

In  addition,  the  current  risk  minimisation  activities  described  in  the  conditions  or  restrictions  with 
regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product in Annex II of the Product information are 
considered adequate for the proposed extension of indication. 
Therefore,  the  CHMP  considers  that  the  benefit  of  Tracleer  in  patients  with  PAH  WHO  functional 
class II outweighs the risks.

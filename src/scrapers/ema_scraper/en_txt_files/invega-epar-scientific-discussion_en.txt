SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
1 
Introduction 
This  is  a  complete,  Article  8(3)  application  for  Invega  prolonged  release  tablets  containing  the  new 
active substance paliperidone, belonging to the class of atypical antipsychotics.  
The claimed indication for Invega tablets, available in strengths of 3 mg, 6 mg, 9 mg and 12 mg, is the 
treatment of schizophrenia. 
Paliperidone  (9-hydroxy-risperidone)  is  the  major  metabolite  of  risperidone,  which  is  approved  for 
treatment  of  schizophrenia  since  1994.  Paliperidone  shares  the  characteristic  serotonin  (5HT2A)  and 
dopamine  (D2)  antagonism  and  receptor  binding  profile  of  its  parent  risperidone.  It  binds also to a1-
adrenergic receptors, and, with lower affinity, to H1-histaminergic and a2-adrenergic receptors, which 
may explain some of the other effects of paliperidone. 
The  goals  of  treatment  of  schizophrenia  are  to  rapidly  eliminate  symptoms,  reduce  the  number  of 
relapses, and reduce the severity of the illness. Improving the level of social function and relationships 
are also important. 
Antipsychotics are the mainstay of treatment of schizophrenia. Conventional antipsychotics, typified 
by haloperidol, have a proven track record over the last half-century in the treatment of schizophrenia. 
While these drugs are highly effective against the positive, psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, they 
show little benefit in alleviating negative symptoms or the cognitive impairment associated with the 
disease. 
Second  generation,  also  called  atypical  antipsychotics,  differ  considerably  in  their  chemical, 
pharmacological, and clinical profiles and are generally characterised by effectiveness against both the 
positive and negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia and with enhanced safety profile with 
respect to extrapyramidal symptoms. 
Although  a  number  of  products  in  this  class  are  currently  available,  treatment  challenges  and 
consequently  goals  for  the  development  of  a  new  second  generation  antipsychotic  continue  to  exist 
such as the need for titration, twice daily dosing, slow onset of action necessitating the use of acute 
intramuscular treatment, and high treatment discontinuation rates due to lack of compliance or other 
reasons. 
Paliperidone is presented as a prolonged-release formulation. The goal of the development program 
was to identify an extended-release formulation that would enhance the initial tolerability and permit 
initiation of treatment at an effective dose without the need for initial dose titration. Invega prolonged 
release tablets are based on the patented OROS® (ORal Osmotic System) Push-PullTM technology 
delivery system, designed to deliver the paliperidone active substance in a controlled manner over 24 
hours, thereby achieving an effective once-a-day treatment for schizophrenia. The system deploys an 
osmotic gradient across a semi-permeable membrane for the delivery of the active substance. In 
addition, paliperidone has been developed as a racemate, since the R- and S-enantiomers have similar 
pharmacological activity and interconvert in vivo.

Quality aspects 
Introduction 
Invega 3, 6, 9, and 12 mg prolonged release tablets contain paliperidone as the only active ingredient. 
Paliperidone  is  a  new  chemical  entity  belonging  to  the  atypical  antipsychotic  class  of  psychotropic 
drugs.  The  dosage  forms  described  in  this  registration  dossier  are  prolonged  release  tablets  using 
OROS® Push-PullTM technology to deliver the active substance in a controlled rate over 24 hours.  
Invega is administered orally once daily for the treatment for schizophrenia. The proposed indication 
is: “Treatment of schizophrenia”. 
They are supplied in four different packaging materials: 
•  White high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with induction sealing, and polypropylene 
(PP) child-resistant closure and two 1-g desiccant silica gel pouches. 
•  Oriented polyamide (OPA)-aluminum (AL)-polyvinyl chloride (PVC)/AL push-through 
blister.

•  PVC laminated with polychloro trifluoroethylene (PCTFE)/AL push-through blister. 
•  White PVC laminated with PCTFE/paper-AL push-through blister. 
Active substance 
Paliperidone is a white to yellow non-hygroscopic powder. It corresponds to the molecular formula: 
C23H27FN4O3 and its relative molecular mass is 426.49. Its chemical name is (±)-3-[2-[4-(6-fluoro-1, 
2-benzisoxazol-3-yl)-1-piperidinyl]ethyl]-6,  7,  8,  9-tetrahydro-9-hydroxy-2-methyl-4Hpyrido[1,  2-a] 
pyrimidin-4-one.  
Paliperidone’s dissociation constants are pKa1 = 8.2 (piperidine moiety) and pKa2 = 2.6 (pyrimidine 
moiety). Its solubility in water is 0.003 g/100 ml, rising to to 2.3 g/100 ml in 0.1 N HCl, whereas in 
ethanol it is 0.076 g/100 ml. The logP of the substance as a neutral molecule in a 1-octanol/aqueous 
buffered solution (pH 11.9) is 2.39, while the logP of the substance regardless of its form in phosphate 
solution of pH 7.0 is 1.02. 
Paliperidone  has  one  chiral  centre  and  is  synthesised  as  a  racemic  mixture.  Two  polymorphs  were 
observed, polymorph I and II, in addition to a hydrate and a solvate. In the final active substance only 
polymorph I is present, which is the thermodynamically stable crystal form. It has been shown that all 
investigated active substance batches are of the same crystalline form I. 
•  Manufacture 
Paliperidone  is  manufactured  by  a  three-step  process  followed  by  a  purification  and  a  milling  step. 
Acceptable specification for the catalysts used in the process has been presented. The description of 
the route of synthesis of the starting materials is also regarded sufficient.  
During  the  development  of  paliperidone  active  substance,  the  manufacturing  process  has  been 
optimised, however the general pathway, including key starting materials and intermediates, remained 
unchanged. The synthesis changes that were made throughout development lead to three versions of 
the  manufacturing  process,  but  are  considered  minor  and  resulted  in  comparable  active  substance 
quality. 
A study on the crystallization parameters consistently showed polymorph I is produced, demonstrating 
that  the  crystallization  step  is  under  control.  Moreover,  the  hydrate  and  polymorph  II  can  only  be 
obtained by a process which is completely different from the current manufacturing process. 
•  Specification 
The  specification  for  the  control  of  the  active  substance  includes  tests  for  appearance  (visual 
examination),  identification  (IR  (Ph.  Eur)  and  HPLC),  heavy  metals  (USP),  residue  on  ignition  and 
sulphated  ash  (USP  at  only  release),  water  content (Karl-Fischer),  assay  (HPLC),  related  substances 
(HPLC), residual solvents (GC) and particle size (laser diffraction). 
In  humans,  the  AUC  ratio  of  R/S  enantiomers  is  similar  for  the  different  racemic  formulations. 
Furthermore,  it  has  been  demonstrated  that  both  enantiomers  interconvert  into  each  other  after  oral 
administration  of  the  separate  enantiomers.  Therefore,  no  specific  optical  rotation  testing  will  be 
performed for release of paliperidone. 
Intrinsic dissolution profiles of polymorph I, II and the hydrate are identical. Based on these data and 
the stability studies, which show that polymorph I is the most stable and that only this configuration is 
present  at  the  different  time  points  and  conditions,  a  specification  for  polymorphism  is  not  deemed 
necessary.  
The specifications for paliperidone are based on analyses of 38 batches of active substance, prepared 
by  the  commercial  process,  and  on  toxicological  and  stability  data.  The  provided  batch  analyses, 
confirm the suitability of the specifications.  
•  Stability 
Paliperidone  active  substance  has  been  subjected  to  several  stability  studies,  including  stress 
conditions and studies under long-term, intermediate and accelerated conditions  
Stability  data  for  four  production  batches  have  been  submitted  stored  at  25°C/60%  RH  (normal 
conditions) and at 30°C/65% RH for up to 24 months and at 40°C/75% RH (accelerated) for up to 6 
months.  The  parameters  studied  are  appearance,  assay,  impurities,  water  content,  polymorphism, 
transition  temperature,  optical  purity,  particle  size  and  microbiological  purity.  The  testing  methods 
used are the same as those used at release testing.

The  stability  data  provided  indicate  that  the  active  substance  remains  stable  at  different  storage 
conditions. In addition, no difference has been observed for the stability behaviour of the paliperidone 
active  substance  synthesised  by  the  different  versions  of  the  current  manufacturing  method.  The 
stability data provided support the proposed retest period without any labelling instructions. 
Medicinal Product 
Janssen-Cilag International NV has applied for the 3, 6, 9, and 12 mg strength tablets. However, for 
the sake of completeness, the 15 mg tablet was also included in the Quality documentation, a strength 
which  was  used  in  clinical  and  stability  studies.  Nevertheless,  the  Applicant  is  not  seeking 
authorisation for this additional strength, but because the bracketing approach of the stability studies is 
very  much  based  on  stability  data  from  the  15  mg  strength,  this  strength  has  also  been  taken  into 
account during the assessment. 
•  Pharmaceutical Development 
Invega  utilises  the  tri-layer  core  OROS®
  Push-PullTM  technology  system  developed  by  Alza.  This 
osmotic delivery system consists of 2 drug layers and a push layer. Drug layer 1 contains a lower drug 
concentration than drug layer 2, which provides the drug concentration gradient necessary to achieve 
an  ascending  release  rate  pattern.  Additionally,  the  expandable  push  layer  consists  of  hydrophilic 
polymers and osmotic excipients and it contributes to the drug delivery. The tablet core is surrounded 
by a lubricating subcoat, which enhances robustness of the drug release pattern. The semi-permeable 
membrane acts as a rate controlling membrane and provides to the tablet mechanical durability. Drug 
release from the tablet is inversely related to the membrane weight applied to the tablets.   
Two  orifices  are  laser  drilled  through  the  membrane  and  subcoat  on  the  first  drug  layer  side  of  the 
elongated core of the tablet to provide exit ports for the drug. The presence of the orifices is vital to 
meet  the  specified  release  profile.  The  colour  overcoat  and  the  print  applied  on  the  colour  allow 
differentiation between the different strengths. 
The water-dispersible colour overcoat erodes quickly in the GI tract. Water is then absorbed through 
the  semi-permeable,  rate-controlling  membrane  at  a  consistent  rate  into  the  core  as  a  result  of  the 
osmotic  activity  gradient  established  across  the  membrane  by  the  osmotic  excipients.  As  the  drug 
layers  hydrate,  a  gel-like  suspension  of  paliperidone  is  formed  in  situ.    Similarly,  the  push  layer 
imbibes  water  and  the  hydrophilic  polymers  hydrate  and  begin  to  expand.  Delivery  of  the  active 
substance begins when the volumetric expansion of the osmotic push layer begins to “push” the gel-
like drug suspension through the orifices. 
The osmotic gradient controls the flux of water through the membrane and into the core, which in turn 
controls the rate of drug delivered from the tablet. Because water is absorbed at a consistent rate and 
the volume of the tablet remains essentially the same the delivery rate of drug is proportional to the 
rate  at  which  water  permeates  the  membrane  and  the  drug  concentration  at  the  orifice.  Since  rate 
control  resides  within  the  semi-permeable  membrane,  the  active  substance  release  is  essentially 
independent  from  environmental  pH,  agitation,  and  other  conditions  encountered 
the 
gastrointestinal tract. Moreover, drug is expelled from the core continuously as the tablet travels along 
the gastrointestinal tract.  
Only  the  particle  size  was  specified  as  the  key  property  of  the  active  substance  during  Invega 
development.  The  tablet  functionality  was  shown  to  be  independent  of  the  active  substance  particle 
size  within  a  certain  the  D50  range.  The  mean  particle  size  of  the  active  substance  is  controlled  by 
milling. 
Finally, all inactive ingredients of Invega are conventional pharmaceutical excipients used are at the 
typical  levels  for  a  prolonged  release  tablet  formulations.  The  compatibility  of  excipient  with  the 
active substance was established by appropriate compatibility studies.  
Initial  PK  and  PD  evaluation  focused  on  the  optimal  release  rate  and  was  conducted  with  tablets 
containing  2  mg  of  paliperidone.  Two  formulations,  differing  only  in  the  amount  (thickness)  of  the 
rate controlling membrane, were tested to provide distinct drug delivery durations with nominal t90 of 
10  hours  (“fast”)  and  nominal  t90  of  20  hours  (“slow”).  The  bioavailability  of  the “fast” and “slow” 
tablets under fasted conditions was 45% and 32%, respectively, relative to the immediate release oral 
solution.  In  addition,  the  incidence  of  orthostatic  hypotension  was  lower  for  the  “slow”  tablets 
compared  with  the  other  two  formulations.  An  alternative  formulation  was  developed  to  increase 
bioavailability without compromising the favourable effect on the orthostatic hypotension. 2 mg drug 
overcoated  tablets  were  developed  and  tested  to  explore  the  impact  of  increased  amount  of  drug 
in 
3/58

delivered  in  the  upper  GI  tract.  The  bioavailability  of  the  overcoated  formulation  was  improved  to 
45% but did not outweigh the “slow” formulation advantage in the tolerability profile. Therefore, the 
“slow” formulation was selected for further testing in Phase 3 clinical trials. The 3 and 9 mg tablets 
finally chosen for the Phase 3 efficacy studies were similar to the “slow” tablets.  
An  in  vitro-in  vivo  correlation  (IVIVC)  was  demonstrated  for  Invega  tablets  and  a  Level  A  IVIVC 
model was shown and validated by establishing internal and external predictability. 
Ultimately,  during  the  development  of  the  commercial  formulation  the  core  layer  weight  was 
optimised  and  in  a  number  of  studies,  the  effect  of  subcoat  on  release  functionality,  the  effect  of 
membrane weight on release and the effect of orifice size and placement on release functionality were 
investigated. Moreover the relationship between the key properties of cellulose acetate (the principal 
component  of  the  rate  controlling  membrane)  and  the  release  functionality  of  Invega  tablets  was 
defined  allowing  a  target  membrane  weight  to  be  set  for  each  lot  of  cellulose  acetate  in  order  to 
achieve the target release profile. The target coating weight can be modified based upon excipient lot 
behaviour  affording  an  important  control  feature  of  the  process  that  assures  consistent  release 
behaviour of the product from lot to lot. 
To  ensure  that  each  Invega  tablet  has  two  orifices,  the  laser  drilling  system  is  equipped  with  an 
automated  verification  system  that  detects  the  laser  activation  for  every  tablet.  If  the  laser  is  not 
activated, the system ejects the tablet. In addition to the in-process controls, an in vitro evaluation was 
performed to determine the effect of the lack of orifice on the performance of the dosage form from a 
safety point of view. Tablets without any orifice were intentionally manufactured and the results were 
evaluated. It could be demonstrated that there is no risk for dose dumping for the “no orifice” tablets. 
Considering all this, it can be assumed that the proposed measures to control the drilling process are 
sufficient and suitable. 
•  Adventitious Agents 
With  the  exception  of  lactose  monohydrate  and  stearic  acid,  none  of  the  excipients  used  in  the 
manufacturing  of  Invega  are  from  animal  origin.  Lactose  does  not  contain  and  is  not  derived  from 
specified risk materials, as defined in the EU Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of 22 May 2001. A TSE 
certificate for stearic acid has been provided. 
•  Manufacture of the Product 
The process for the manufacture of paliperidone ER tablets consists of the following major operating 
steps: Granulation (Drug Layer 1, Drug Layer 2, Push Layer), Blending (Drug Layer 1, Drug Layer 2, 
Push  Layer),  Core  Compression,  Subcoating,  Membrane  Coating,  Laser  Drilling,  Drying,  Colour 
Overcoat and Packaging. A bioequivalence study was performed to compare the in vivo performance 
of  the  product  manufactured  at  the  two  different  manufacturing  sites.  The  study  showed  that  the  in 
vivo  profiles  are  similar,  demonstrating  that  the  batches  are  bioequivalent,  regardless  of  the 
manufacturing site. 
•  Product Specification 
The  specification  for  batch  release  and  shelf-life  include  the  following  tests:  Appearance  (Visual), 
Identification  (HPLC,  FTIR),  Assay  (HPLC),  Degradation  products  (HPLC),  Uniformity  of  Content 
(Ph.Eur.), Water content (Karl Fischer), Residual Solvent (GC), Dissolution (Ph.Eur.) and Microbial 
Limits (Ph.Eur.). Dissolution profile is controlled at the time points of 2, 8, 14 and 24 h. 
Batch analysis data were provided for three batches of Invega 3 mg tablets, three batches 15 mg tablets 
and for one batch of each of the 6, 9 and 12 mg tablets. These batches were manufactured at both sites, 
according  to  the  proposed  commercial  manufacturing  process.  The  batch  analysis  data  provided 
indicate  the  capability  of  the  manufacturing  process  to  produce  Invega  prolonged  release  tablets  of 
consistent quality, complying with the designed specification.  
•  Stability of the Product 
Each  strength  of  Invega  has  been  packaged  in  the  proposed  four  different  packaging  materials.  A 
bracketing approach was applied and three batches of the highest and lowest strengths (i.e. 3 and 15 
mg) were packaged in each of the four different packaging configurations. One batch of each of the 
intermediate strengths (i.e., 6, 9, and 12 mg) was also packaged in the 4 packaging configurations and 
placed on stability using the ICH recommended storage conditions.  
Up to 12 months of stability data (studies are on-going) at 25 °C/60% RH, 30 °C/65% RH and 5 °C 
and up to 6 months at accelerated conditions (40 °C/75% RH) demonstrate that tablets of all strengths 
4/58 
©EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
of  Invega  are  stable  for  the  attributes  of  appearance,  assay,  degradation  products,  drug  release  and 
water content in all four proposed packaging materials. Annual microbial testing was included in the 
protocols of one batch each of 3 and 15 mg tablets in all four packages. The testing methods used were 
the  same  as  those  used  at  release.  In  addition,  one  batch  of  each  strength  was  subjected  to 
confirmatory  photostability  studies  as  per  the  ICH  conditions.  These  batches  were  packaged  in  that 
material of the four providing the least protection to light. Results demonstrated satisfactory resistance 
to photo-degradation. 
Finally, in-use stability studies were performed on bottled tablets of one batch of 3- and 15-mg tablets, 
at 9 months, and will be performed again at 23 months each. Results at 9 months showed that Invega 
tablets are stable during use in a multi-dose container. 
In  conclusion,  based  upon  the  overall  stability  data  presented,  the  proposed  shelf  life  and  storage 
conditions Invega tablets as stated in the SPC are acceptable. 
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The  quality  of  Invega  prolonged-release  tablets  is  adequately  established.  In  general,  sufficient 
chemical and pharmaceutical documentation relating to development, manufacture and control of the 
active  substance  and  drug  product  has  been  presented.  There  are  no  major  deviations  from  EU  and 
ICH requirements. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of 
all  the  important  product  quality  characteristics.  It  can  be  safely  concluded  that  the  product  should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.  
Stability  tests  indicate  that  the  product  under  ICH  guidelines  conditions  is  chemically  stable  for  the 
proposed shelf life.

Non-clinical aspects 
Introduction 
Paliperidone is 9-hydroxy-risperidone, which is the major metabolite of risperidone. Paliperidone and 
risperidone have similar pharmacological profiles. The pharmacokinetic profile of paliperidone is also 
similar  to  the  active  fraction  (paliperidone  and  risperidone)  of  risperidone.  Thus,  similar  effects  of 
paliperidone as for risperidone should be expected.  
Most  of  the  nonclinical  pharmacology  and  the  absorption,  distribution,  metabolism  and  excretion 
(ADME) studies on paliperidone were performed at the time when studies were conducted to support 
the marketing application of risperidone (Risperdal®). However, some ADME studies have also been 
conducted  with  oral  paliperidone.  Some  of  the  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  have  also  included 
risperidone.  Studies  addressing  the  gastrointestinal  tolerability  of  paliperidone  ER  tablets,  and  the 
toxicity of impurities in forced degraded paliperidone ER tablets were also conducted.  
GLP aspects 
All non-clinical pharmacology studies are non-GLP studies. Pivotal studies on pharmacokinetics and 
on toxicology were GLP-compliant. 
Pharmacology 
Paliperidone (R076477 or 9-OH-risperidone) is a receptor monoaminergic antagonist that exhibits the 
characteristic dopamine type 2 (D2) and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT] type 2A [5-HT2A]) 
antagonism  of  antipsychotic  drugs.  Paliperidone  is  the  major  active  metabolite  of  risperidone 
(Risperdal®)  which  is  a  widely  used  atypical  antipsychotic  approved  for  the  treatment  of 
schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders.

The  binding  profiles  for  paliperidone, its enantiomers  R078543(+)  and  R078544(−)  and  risperidone 
are  comparable.  Paliperidone is  also  an  antagonist  at  α1-  and  α2-adrenergic  receptors  and 
the histamine  H1-receptor  in  vitro  and  in  vivo. In  similarity  with  risperidone, cardiovascular  safety 
issues  with  clinical  relevance  have  been  identified at paliperidone  treatment. These  are  discussed  in 
the clinical safety section of this report. 
•  Primary pharmacodynamics  
Paliperidone displays high affinity for 5-HT2A (Ki 0.22-0.25 nM) and D2 (Ki 4.6 nM) receptors, and 
is  also  active  as  an  antagonist  at  the  α1-and  α2-adrenergic  receptors  and  the  H1-receptor.  Binding 
affinities  and  profiles  for  all  investigated  receptor  sites  are  similar  for  paliperidone,  its  enantiomers 
and  risperidone.  Several  in  vivo  studies  were  performed  in  rats  and  dogs.  In  rats,  paliperidone  was 
slightly  less  potent  than  risperidone  at  early  time  intervals,  but  became  equipotent  at  later  time 
intervals, probably reflecting a slower rate of brain penetration. In dogs, paliperidone, its enantiomers 
and risperidone were roughly equipotent against apomorphine-induced emesis. 
Overall, paliperidone induced the expected effects (activity in functional pharmacology models) and 
the  investigated  in  vivo  effects  were  qualitatively  and  quantitatively  similar  for  paliperidone  and 
risperidone.  
•  Secondary pharmacodynamics 
Dopamine  secreted  in  the  portal  hypophyseal  circulation  inhibits  prolactin  release.  By  antagonizing 
this tonic inhibitory action of endogenous dopamine, D2 receptor antagonists elevate prolactin release. 
The  suppressive  effect  of  dopamine  on  prolactin  release  in  rat  anterior  pituitary  cells  was  dose-
dependently  antagonized  by  paliperidone,  risperidone  and  haloperidol.  Both  paliperidone  and 
risperidone  were  less  potent  than  haloperidol  in  this  in  vitro  assay,  (2  and  3  times  less  potent, 
respectively).  Paliperidone  was  equipotent  to  risperidone  in  reversing  the  dopamine-induced 
suppression  of  prolactin  release  from  anterior  pituitary  cells.  Both  compounds  provoked  more 
pronounced  plasma  prolactin  levels  than  haloperidol  when  measured  1  h  after  identical  i.p.  or  oral 
doses.  
Secondary  pharmacodynamic  effects  and  side  effect  (pre-clinical)  profile  of  paliperidone  are  very 
similar  to  those  of  risperidone.  Anti-adrenergic  and  anti-histaminergic  effects  are  suspect  to  elicit 
hypotensive and sedative effects. Hyperprolactinemia is expected due to the D2-receptor antagonism. 
•  Safety pharmacology programme 
In in-vitro studies paliperidone at concentrations of > 1 µM inhibited both HERG currents and native 
IKr, prolonged the APD, occasionally induced EADs, instability, triangulation and Torsade de Pointes 
(TdP) arrhythmias, which are all markers for a torsadogenic potential. Therefore, the slight inhibitory 
effects of paliperidone on both INa and ICa,L, which were observed at a concentration of 10 µM, do not 
seem  to  be  protective  against  the  induction  of  TdP  arrhythmias  by  paliperidone  at  micromolar 
concentrations.  Therapeutically  effective  free  plasma  concentrations  of  paliperidone  in  humans  are 
about 20 nM. A 30-fold margin between free therapeutic plasma concentrations and IC50 values for the 
block of HERG currents appears to be a line of demarcation between the majority of drugs associated 
with  TdP  arrhythmias  and  those  which  are  not.  Therefore,  when  the  paliperidone  concentrations 
effective in in-vitro electrophysiological studies are compared to therapeutically effective free plasma 
concentrations, paliperidone seems to have a low torsadogenic potential. Nevertheless, since Torsade 
de pointes may occur with antipsychotics, the torsadogenic potential of paliperidone has been included 
in section 4.8 of the SPC.  
In-vivo  studies  performed  in  guinea-pigs  and  dogs  did  not  show  marked  effects  of  paliperidone  on 
QTc  at  micromolar  plasma  concentrations,  which  might  question  the  relevance  of  these  in-vivo 
models. However, in the Carlsson model, paliperidone did demonstrate effects on the QTc.
•  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No  studies  were  performed.  The  CHMP  considered  this  acceptable  since  the  extensive  clinical  and 
nonclinical experience with risperidone and also taking into account that administration of risperidone 
results in significant paliperidone exposure.

Pharmacokinetics 
Enantiomers 
The  chemical  structure  of  paliperidone  contains  a  chiral  center,  and  paliperidone  can  therefore  exist 
racemate  of  the  two  enantiomers  R078543(+)  or  R078544(-).  Interconversion  occurs  in  aqueous 
solution  under  acidic  and  alkaline  conditions.  In  vivo  interconversion  is  also  observed resulting in a 
particular  ratio  that  is  slightly  different  across  species.  Following  paliperidone  administration  to 
laboratory  animals,  there  is  a  systemic  abundance  of  R078544(-)  over  R078543(+).  In  humans 
however, R078543(+) is slightly more abundant in plasma following administration of the ER OROS 
formulation.  Nevertheless,  the  pharmacological  and  PK  profiles  of  paliperidone  and  the  two 
enantiomers  are  comparable  both  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  and  furthermore  also  closely  resemble  that  of 
risperidone. 
Absorption – Bioavailability 
Paliperidone  was  well  absorbed  in  dog  and  rats  after  oral  administration  of  a  paliperidone  solution. 
The absolute p.o. bioavailability was estimated at 94.4% in dogs, 78 % in female rats and 46% in male 
rats. The gender difference observed in the rat species is consistent with a higher rate of metabolism in 
the male rat. Plasma concentrations obtained after the administration of the OROS ER system never 
exceeded those seen after dosing with the p.o. solution and resulted in longer time to maximum plasma 
concentrations and lower Cmax and bioavailability (15.1% compared to paliperidone solution).  
Tissue distribution 
Paliperidone related radioactivity was widely distributed, the highest concentrations in terms of AUC 
were found in liver, small intestinal tissue and salivary gland in rats, with T/P AUC ratios for these 
tissues  ranging  from  21  to  24.  The  peak  concentration  in  the  liver  represented  17  %  of  the  dose 
radioactivity.  Lowest  concentrations  of  total  radioactivity  were  measured  in  brain,  muscle,  white  fat 
and testis, with T/P AUC ratios of less than 1. In dogs, the highest tissue concentrations were seen in 
the  liver,  lung  and  kidney,  with  average  levels  5  to  7  times  higher  than  the  corresponding  plasma 
levels. Paliperidone was rapidly and widely distributed and crossed the blood-brain barrier; in brain, it 
was  preferentially  distributed  to  the  frontal  cortex  and  striatum.  In  plasma  protein  binding  studies  it 
was shown that in all species tested, including human, paliperidone is bound to a maximum of 85 %. 
No study on placental transfer was performed with paliperidone but available data for risperidone in 
rats  indicate  that  placental  transfer  is  limited.  Paliperidone  and/or  its  metabolites  were  excreted  into 
milk  in  rats.  Tissue  radioactivity  levels  declined  rapidly,  with  no  retention  observed  in  any  of  the 
investigated tissues of these albino rats. 
Protein binding 
In  plasma  protein  binding  studies  it  was  shown  that  in  all  species  tested,  including  human, 
paliperidone  is  bound  to  a  maximum  of  85  %.  Plasma  protein  binding  of  the  enantiomers  exhibited 
species-dependent  stereoselectivity,  with  higher  protein  binding  seen  with  R078543(+)  than  with 
R078544(-) in dog and human plasma. In human plasma, paliperidone was predominately bound to the 
α1-acid glycoprotein. 
In vitro metabolism 
The in vitro metabolism of  14C -paliperidone and its separate enantiomers was studied in subcellular 
liver fractions from male and female Swiss albino mice and Wistar and Sprague Dawley rats, female 
NZW rabbits, male Beagle dogs, and humans. Paliperidone was metabolized to a very limited extent in 
human  liver  matrices  as well as in mouse, rabbit and dog liver matrices, whereas it was extensively 
metabolized  in  Wistar  rat  liver  matrices  and  Sprague-Dawley  rat  hepatocyte  suspensions.  In  vitro,  a 
total  of  eight  metabolites  were  identified,  with  pathways  of  primary  importance  including  N-
dealkylation  and  alicyclic  hydroxylation.  The  major  compound  observed  in  primary  hepatocyte 
cultures  was  paliperidone  (20-90%).  Based  on  the  metabolism  rate  alone,  there  were  no  major 
quantitative differences observed between enantiomers (with the exception of mice and rabbits), and 
all  metabolites  observed  with  paliperidone  were  also  seen  with  the  individual  enantiomers.  Since 
metabolism was very limited in the non-rodent species and man, any possible impact of gender-related 
differences and stereoselectivity in metabolism may be negligible.  
In vivo metabolism

In  rats,  paliperidone  was  extensively  metabolized  and  the  excretion  of  unchanged  paliperidone 
accounted  for  3.19  (male)  and  6.42%  (female)  of  the  dose.  The  urine  and  faeces  obtained  from  rats 
contained  unchanged  paliperidone  and  seven  metabolites,  M1,  M6,  M7,  M8,  M9,  M10,  M11,  (each 
accounting for more than 1% of the dose), and four minor metabolites (each accounting for less than 
1% of the dose). In rat plasma, paliperidone was the major compound (50-68%). In rats, paliperidone 
was  mostly  metabolized  by  alicyclic  hydroxylation,  oxidative  N-dealkylation  and  benzisoxazole 
scission. 
In  dogs,  the  excretion  of  total  radioactivity  in  urine  and  faeces  were  slower  than  in  the  rat:  at  168 
hours  after  dosing,  59.8%  the  dose  was  excreted  in  urine  and  32.4%  of  the  dose  was  excreted  in 
faeces. Metabolism was limited and after 48 hours the unchanged paliperidone accounted for 32.4% in 
the urine and none in faeces. The urine and faeces obtained from dogs contained also five metabolites, 
M8, M9, M10, M11, M12, M16 (accounting each for 1.2-6.5% of the total radioactivity). Unchanged 
paliperidone  accounted  for  82%  of  the  total  radioactivity  in  plasma  (0-24h  sample).    In  dog  plasma 
only paliperidone and the M9 metabolite were detected (M9 accounting for up to 5% of plasma total 
radioactivity).  In  the  excreta  of  dogs,  biotransformation  products  resulted  from  oxidative  N-
dealkylation, alcohol dehydrogenation and benzisoxazole scission, whether or not in combination with 
glucuronidation, alicyclic mono-hydroxylation or di-hydroxylation. 
In conclusion, the major biotransformation pathways were similar across species. Paliperidone was the 
major compound in plasma (50-97%) in man, rat and dog and the major compound (32-59%) in urine 
in man and dog. Overall, the species chosen for toxicity studies are considered relevant. 
The metabolites observed following administration of paliperidone have also been observed following 
risperidone  administration.  Thus,  no  new  metabolites  were  identified  after the p.o. administration of 
paliperidone as compared to risperidone. 
Excretion 
Excretion was examined after single p.o. administration of  14C-paliperidone at a dose of 0.63 mg/kg 
bw in male and female Wistar rats, in male Beagle dogs and in healthy male subjects one week after 
receiving a 1-mg dose. 
Mass  balance  data  was  obtained  from  rats  and  dogs  and  compared  to  human  data  (Table 1). Biliary 
excretion was not determined.

In rats, most of the paliperidone-related radioactivity (86%) was excreted with the faeces. In dogs and 
humans, the most important excretion route was urine. In humans the cumulative excretion in the urine 
amounted to 79.6% of the dose. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Due  to  the  very  limited  metabolism  of  14C-paliperidone,  the  involvement  of  cytochrome  P450-
specific forms in paliperidone metabolism was studied using membrane preparations of heterologous 
systems  expressing  cytochrome  P450  isoforms  CYP1A2,  CYP2A6,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  CYP2D6, 
CYP3A5, and CYP3A4 in combination with cytochrome P450 reductase. In vitro results revealed the 
possible involvement of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 in the overall metabolism of paliperidone, and in the 
formation  of  M11via  benzisoxazole  scission.  No  ex  vivo  induction  and  inhibition  studies  have  been 
performed. However, the effect of risperidone on hepatic enzyme activity was examined in an ex vivo 
study,  in  which  male  Wistar  rats  were  administered  risperidone  as  repeated  daily  p.o.  doses  for  1 
week.  Risperidone  exhibited  no  effects  in  vivo  on  any  of  the  cytochrome  P450  isoenzyme  activities 
measured,  or  on  UDP-glucuronosyltransferase  activity.  In  vitro  studies  with  Caco-2  cells  indicated 
that paliperidone appears to have a weak P-gp inhibitory effect. No in vivo studies were performed and 
the clinical relevance is unknown.

Toxicology 
•  Single dose toxicity 
The  toxicity  of  single  doses  of  paliperidone  has  been  investigated  in  mice  and  rats  via  oral  and 
intravenous  routes.  In  single  dose  toxicity  studies,  paliperidone  was  of  moderate  acute  toxicity  with 
approximate non-lethal doses of more than 80 mg/kg (p.o.) in mice and more than 20-40 mg/kg (p.o.) 
in  rats.  Upon  single  intravenous  (i.v.)  bolus  administration  of  paliperidone,  no  test-article  related 
mortalities  were  seen  at  dose  levels  up  to  10  mg/kg  in  mice  and  40  mg/kg  in  rats,  respectively. 
Sedation and ptosis were consistently noted across rodent species and routes of administration. 
•  Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) 
Paliperidone has been extensively tested in oral repeat-dose toxicity studies in mouse (3 months), rat 
(up to 6 months), dog (paliperidone up to 3- months and risperidone administered for 12 months). In 
studies ≥ 3 months, mice, rats and dogs were exposed to paliperidone doses (oral solution or dietary 
administration)  up  to  10,  20  and  5  mg/kg/day,  respectively.  Dogs  in  a  3-month  study  were 
administered an ER formulation up to 90 mg/day.  
Toxicity findings related to exaggerated pharmacology, especially due to the dopamine D2 antagonist 
activity, were numerous. Treatment-related sedation and (palpebral) ptosis were consistently observed 
in the repeat-dose toxicity studies with paliperidone or risperidone in mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs. In 
addition,  enhanced  prolactin  release  was  associated  with  changes  in  the  following  tissues:  pituitary 
gland,  mammary  gland,  endocrine  pancreas,  female  genital  tract,  male  accessory  sex  organs  and 
adrenal  glands  in  repeat  dose  toxicity  and  carcinogenicity  studies.  Changes  in  body  weight,  body 
weight  gain  and  food  consumption  were  also  noted.  Treatment  related  changes  related  to  the  anti-
adrenergic activity were also seen in the red pulp of the spleen in paliperidone and risperidone treated 
rats  and  dogs.  Furthermore,  QTc  prolongation  and  testes  effects,  probably  unrelated  to  exaggerated 
pharmacology, were observed in dogs.  
The observed toxicities were seen at systemic exposures in rats and mice below the human exposure 
(12  mg  paliperidone).  In  dogs,  the  systemic  exposure  was  approximately  at  or  slightly  above  the 
clinical  exposure.  Similar  toxicity  profiles  were  seen  after  administration  of  paliperidone  and 
risperidone (see also Genotoxicity). 
Genotoxicity 
The  genotoxicity  of  paliperidone  has  been  studied  with  respect  to  gene  mutations  in  bacteria, 
mutations in TK locus in vitro in Mouse Lymphoma L5178Y cells and in vivo in the rat micronucleus 
test  in  bone  marrow.  In  similarity  with  risperidone,  no  genotoxic  potential  was  evident  in  any  test 
system when tested up to appropriate concentrations and dose levels according to guidelines.  
•  Carcinogenicity 
In dietary carcinogenicity studies, mice and rats were p.o. treated with risperidone at dose levels of 0, 
0.63,  2.5,  or  10  mg/kg  bw/day.  In  mice,  predominantly  at  the  highest  dose  level,  non  neoplastic 
histopathological  changes  were  observed  in  the  pituitary  gland,  male  endocrine  pancreas,  male 
accessory  sex  organs,  female  genital  tract,  and  female  mammary  glands.  An  increased  incidence  of 
splenic  red  pulp  hyperplasia  was  observed  in  both  sexes.  No  treatment-related  tumour response was 
observed in male mice. In females, the incidence of mammary adenocarcinomas was increased at all 
dose levels, particularly at 2.5 and 10 mg/kg. A dose-dependent increase in the incidence of pituitary 
gland  adenomas  was  found  in  females  at  2.5  and  10  mg/kg.  In  rats,  non  neoplastic  changes  in  the 
pituitary gland, male and female mammary glands, and male and female genital tract were seen at all 
dose  levels.  At  10  mg/kg,  the  testes  showed  an  increased  incidence  of  degeneration  and 
mineralization. Mineralization of the renal pelvis was enhanced in males and females at all dose levels. 
The incidence of mammary gland adenocarcinoma was increased in males at 10 mg/kg, as well as in 
females  at  all  dose  levels.  Male  rats  also  showed  a  slight  increase  in  the  incidence  of  endocrine 
pancreas adenoma at 2.5 and 10 mg/kg.  
In conclusion, treatment-related tumour findings in mice and rats treated with risperidone occur in the 
mammary glands and endocrine pancreas, probably due to enhanced prolactin levels. In addition, an 
increased  incidence  of  pituitary  tumours  is  observed  in  female  mice;  this  is  thought  to  be  due  to

prolonged  loss  of  dopamine  signaling.  The  doses  used  in  the  carcinogenicity  studies  did  provide 
exposures to active fraction that were only slightly higher than those determined at clinical exposure.  
•  Reproduction Toxicity 
In the male rat fertility study with doses up to 2.5 mg/kg/day no effects on male fertility were observed 
but paternal toxicity was noted at the highest dose. In the female rat fertility study, prolactin-mediated 
pseudopregnancies  and  a  prolongation  of  the  pre-coital  interval  were  observed  at  all  tested  doses 
(0.16-2.5 mg/kg/day). This response is considered to be secondary to prolactin-mediated estrus delay. 
At the maternally toxic top dose level of 2.5 mg/kg/day, there was a slight increase in pre-implantation 
loss  resulting  in  fewer  implantations  and  a  lower  number  of  live  fetuses.  Similar  effects  have  been 
seen with risperidone. 
In the rat embryo foetal development study with doses up to 10 mg/kg/day, even at maternally toxic 
dose  levels,  no  treatment-related  changes  at  external,  visceral  or  skeletal  examination  in  the  fetuses 
were observed. In the rabbit embryo-foetal development study with doses up to 5 mg/kg/day, maternal 
toxicity  was  noted  at  1.25  and  5  mg/kg.  Total  post-implantation  loss  was  slightly  increased  at  5 
mg/kg/day.  This  implantation  loss  was  associated  with  a  slight  increase  in  the  number  of 
embryonic/fetal resorptions and fetal death.  
No test article-related teratogenicity was found. Risperidone was not teratogenic either. 
In  a  combined  pre-  and  postnatal  developmental  toxicity  and  juvenile  toxicity  DRF  study  in  rats, 
treatment with paliperidone took place from GD 6 to Day 7 of lactation (doses up to 2.5 mg/kg/day). 
This  study  indirectly  established  the  excretion  of  paliperidone  in  the  milk  by  the  presence  of 
paliperidone in the suckling pups. Maternal treatment at 2.5 mg/kg/day resulted in a reduction in the 
mean  litter  viability  index  on  Day  7  of  lactation.  The  main  study  was  conducted  in  pregnant  rats 
following administration of paliperidone at dose levels up to 1.25 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through Day 
20 of lactation. Even at maternally toxic dose levels, there were no effects on gestation or parturition. 
Maternal necropsy showed no treatment-related abnormalities. Maternal dosing had no adverse effects 
on pup growth and performance, or on the offspring’s reproductive performance. 
•  Toxicokinetic data 
All  toxicology  studies  were  accompanied  by  an  adequate  toxicokinetic  examination.  Of  special 
interest  are  a)  the  data  from  the  pivotal  studies  performed  in  mice,  rats  and  dogs  comparing 
paliperidone and risperidone administration, b) data from studies with i.v. administration, c) data from 
the  oral  application  of  an  ER-preparation  with  a  powder  preparation  (immediate  release)  and  d)  the 
occurrence of paliperidone in the 12 month toxicity study with risperidone.

Interspecies comparison 
Comparison of exposure in the tested species at LOAEL in the repeat dose toxicity studies and human 
exposures are shown in Table 31. The pharmacokinetic human data used for comparison are based on 
the  following  from  patients  12  mg  daily  (0.24  mg/kg):  AUC(0-24h)  of  896  ng.h/ml    and    Cmax  of  46 
ng/ml (PAL-SCH-101). A number of toxicities in animals were observed after subchronic or chronic 
administration (see table below).

•  Local tolerance  
The local tolerability of the paliperidone ER tablets was evaluated in the GI tract. In a 3-month repeat-
dose toxicity study in beagle dogs the animals were treated p.o. with 15-mg paliperidone ER tablets at 
dose  levels  of  30  and  90  mg/day,  and  paliperidone  bulk  powder  at  90/60  mg/day.  There  were  no 
treatment-related clinical signs or histopathological changes that would indicate gastrointestinal injury 
upon  administration  of  paliperidone  in  the  two  formulations.  No  evidence of gastrointestinal lesions 
was encountered in any of the dosed groups. In single dose toxicity studies in rats, local toxicity was 
noted when high doses of paliperidone were administered by the oral and intravenous routes. 
•  Other toxicity studies 
Immunotoxicity 
• 
There is no indication of an effect of paliperidone on the functionality of the primary T-cell-dependent 
antibody  response  in  the  spleen,  and  the  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  performed  do  not  suggest  any 
immunotoxicological  properties.  No  signs  of  potential  immunotoxicity  were  observed  in  the  repeat-
dose toxicity studies with risperidone previously conducted to support registration of Risperdal®.   
Impurities 
• 
R125239  (metabolite  M12)  is  considered  toxicologically  qualified  up  to  0.62%,  which  is  above  the 
specification  level  of  0.5%  for  the  active  substance,  and  below  the  suggested  specification  for  the 
medicinal product (0.80%).  
Photosafety 
• 
Paliperidone was tested for absorption of UV and visible light with wavelengths of 290 to 700 nm. A 
marginal absorption was seen at 290 nm (absorbance: 1.5) and it gradually declined with increasing 
wavelengths  up  to  320  nm.  No  absorption  occurred  at  wavelengths  exceeding  320  nm.  The 
distribution of paliperidone derived radioactivity was extensive to the distinct melanin-rich structures, 
such as eye-pigment and pigmented parts of the skin and fur in pigmented rats.  The retention was also 
extensive  up  to  the  last  time  point  measured  (336  h).  Since  paliperidone  absorbs  light  at  the 
wavelengths  from  290  to  329  nm  and  reaches  the  eyes  following  systemic  exposure,  photosafety

concerns  must  be  taken  into  account  for  paliperidone.  In  accordance  to  the  CHMP/SWP/398/01 
guideline  “Note  for  guidance  of  photosafety  testing”,  a  photoxicity  study  was  performed.  Results 
showed that at the concentrations tested, paliperidone was not photoxic in this study. In addition, and 
in vitro photomutagenicity test will be submitted as a FUM. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  Applicant  had  initially  submitted  an  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  Report  for  paliperidone 
consisting  of  a  number  of  aquatic  ecotoxicity  studies  and  Predicted  Environmental  Concentration 
(PEC)  /  PNEC  calculations.  From  these  data,  it  was  concluded  that  paliperidone  is  not  a  PBT 
substance  and  that  it  is  unlikely  to  represent  a  risk  to  the  sewage  micro-organisms.  Additional  PEC 
data  were  provided  following  the  CHMP  request;  based  on  these  new  data  no    further  studies  were 
deemed necessary for the evaluation of the environmental impact of paliperidone.  
Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
Paliperidone has been extensively tested to characterise its toxicological and toxicokinetic profiles. All 
pivotal studies constituting the toxicology program were conducted according to GLP standards. Since 
paliperidone  is  the  major  metabolite  of  risperidone,  comparative  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  with 
paliperidone and risperidone were carried out. In line with the scientific advice, no 12-month repeat-
dose  toxicity  study  in  dogs  or  carcinogenicity  studies  in  rats  and  mice  were  performed  with 
paliperidone. These studies were bridged to studies previously conducted with risperidone in support 
of the marketing application for Risperdal®. Similar toxicity profiles were seen after administration of 
paliperidone  and  risperidone.  No  unexpected  findings were  noted  after  paliperidone  treatment. 
Toxicity  findings  were  numerous  and  included  treatment-related  sedation  and  (palpebral)  ptosis 
(observed  in  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  in  mice,  rats,  rabbits,  and  dogs).  In  carcinogenicity  studies 
performed  with  risperidone in mice  and  rats,  treatment  related  tumour  findings  were  noted  in  the 
mammary gland, endocrine pancreas and in the pituitary gland. Changes in body weight, body weight 
gain and food consumption were also noted. Treatment related changes were seen in the red pulp of 
the  spleen  in  paliperidone  and  risperidone  treated  rats  and  dogs,  and  QTc  prolongation  and  testes 
effects  were  observed  in  dogs.  In  similarity  to  risperidone  no  genotoxic  potential  was  observed. 
Paliperidone  was  not  teratogenic  in  rat  and  rabbit,  but  showed  embryotoxicity  at  a  maternally  toxic 
dose in rats. Since paliperidone absorbs light in the wavelength from 290 up 329 nm and reaches the 
eyes following systemic exposure, an in vitro phototoxicity test on paliperidone was performed. This 
test  was  found  negative,  and  the  Applicant  provided  acceptable  justification  for  the  lack  of  the 
additional  photosafety  studies  required  by  the  CPMP/SWP/398/01  guideline  “Note  for  guidance  of 
photosafety testing”. However, the submission of an in vitro photomutagenicity test was requested as a 
Follow Up Measure. In addition, an ERA was initially submitted and, following the CHMP request, 
this was supplemented with an additional PEC value, recalculated using updated source data. Based on 
the ERA and the new data provided, no environmental testing was deemed necessary by the Applicant. 
This was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
Paliperidone  is  a  new  active  substance,  belonging  to  the  class  of  atypical  antipsychotics,  and  is  the 
active  metabolite  of  a  well-known  active  substance,  risperidone.  Risperidone  is  extensively 
metabolised  to  9-hydroxy-risperidone  (i.e.  paliperidone)  via  CYP2D6  and  the  exposure  after 
administration  of  risperidone  is  often  presented  in  terms  of  “active  moiety”,  which  is  the  sum  of 
risperidone and 9-hydroxy-risperidone plasma levels. 
The product is available in strengths of 3 mg, 6 mg, 9 mg and 12 mg, and the proposed indication is 
“Treatment of schizophrenia”. 
Scientific advice for this product was given by the CHMP 2003 on the quality, preclinical and clinical 
development programmes (EMEA/CPMP/SAWG/3572/03). The CPMP stated that both pivotal short-
term  studies  should  be  positive  in  order  to  obtain  a  marketing  authorisation  for  the  indications  of 
treatment  of  schizophrenia  and  the  prevention  of  recurrence  of  schizophrenic  symptoms  over  the 
complete dosage regime (3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 mg). Further on the CPMP also agreed on the choice of 
olanzapine as active comparator.

The  applicant  has  performed  an  extensive  clinical  pharmacology  program  for  PK  and  PD 
characterisation,  comprising  15  clinical  pharmacology  and  13  biopharmaceutical  studies  in  healthy 
volunteers,  schizophrenic  patients  and  special  populations.  In  addition,  population  pharmacokinetic 
analyses and in vitro studies have been performed. IR formulations of paliperidone were used in the 
initial  studies.  Subsequently,  the  development  was  focused  on  ER  formulations  leading  to  the 
development of ER OROS paliperidone, the formulation used in Phase 3 efficacy studies. In the Phase 
3 studies, sparse PK sampling was included and used for a population PK evaluation. 
The  Invega  clinical  program  for  treatment  of  schizophrenia  consisted  of  three  short-term  phase  III 
pivotal  studies  (SCH-303,  SCH-304,  and  SCH-305)  evaluating  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  fixed 
dosages of ER OROS Paliperidone, compared with placebo and the active comparator olanzapine, in 
schizophrenic adults. Across these studies, a total of 1982 subjects were screened, from which 1692 
subjects were enrolled and randomised to double-blind treatment. A total of 972 subjects completed 
the studies. Subjects who completed the 6-week double-blind phase, or who discontinued due to lack 
of efficacy after a minimum of 21 days, were eligible to enter the 52-week open-label extension phase. 
An  additional  phase  III  study  (SCH-301)  was  performed  to  demonstrate  the  effectiveness  of 
paliperidone  in  the  prevention  of  recurrence  of  symptoms  of  schizophrenia.  A  total  of  530  subjects 
were enrolled in the open-label (8 weeks) run-in phase (with flexible doses of paliperidone 3-15 mg), 
312 (59%) subjects entered the open-label (6 weeks) stabilisation phase, and 207 (39%) subjects were 
randomized to double-blind treatment (placebo, n=102; ER OROS Paliperidone, n=105).  
Finally, a Phase III short-term study (SCH-302) was performed on a total of 114 elderly (65 years of 
age or older) patients with schizophrenia in order to evaluate, compared with placebo, the safety and 
efficacy of flexibly dosed Invega administered once daily for 6 weeks. 
The table below (table 5) gives an overview of the Phase III studies contributing to the efficacy profile 
of ER OROS Paliperidone.

The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
Pharmacokinetics 
The  main  objectives  of  the  biopharmaceutics  studies  with  paliperidone  were  to  investigate  absolute 
and  relative  bioavailability,  characterize  prolonged  release  properties,  evaluate  dose  proportionality, 
and  explore  the  effect  of  food  on  the  PK  of  ER  OROS  paliperidone.  The  biopharmaceutics  studies 
were mainly (in particular all phase 1 key studies) conducted in healthy subjects. Each of the studies 
was designed and conducted in accordance with the CPMP guidelines concerning bioavailability and 
bioequivalence (bridging study) and evaluation of food effect.  
Overall  28  Phase  1  and  2a  studies  were  performed  including  also  data  from  different  formulations. 
Data from 4 key Phase 1 studies (R076477-P01-1008, PALIOROS-P01-1012, R076477-P01-1010 and 
R076477-P01-1007) provide information on the biopharmaceutical characteristics of paliperidone. 
•  Methods 
Analytical methods  
In the key studies, analyses of paliperidone (and risperidone, when necessary) were conducted using 
validated  liquid  chromatography-tandem  mass  spectrometry  (LC-MS/MS)  assays.  The  LC-MS/MS 
assay  quantifies  paliperidone  and  risperidone  individually.  If  needed,  plasma  concentrations  of  the 
active moiety can be calculated as the sum of the corresponding plasma risperidone and paliperidone 
concentrations. The analytical methods used showed a satisfactory performance. 
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Non-compartmental  methods  were  used  in  most  studies,  mainly  by  the  use  of  WinNonlin. 
A compartmental  analysis  was performed on the  i.v. data obtained in Study R076477-P01-1007. An 
in vitro-in vivo  correlation  (IVIC)  was  performed  using  a  population  approach  (NONMEM).  A 
population pharmacokinetic analysis on Phase 1 and Phase 3 data was performed using NONMEM. 
AUC was estimated from the time of dosing (t=0) to the time of the last assayed sample. Thereafter 
AUC estimated was extrapolated from the time of the last assayed sample to infinity. The estimated 
part never exceeded 20%. 
The peak plasma concentration was taken as the concentration in the plasma sample with the highest 
concentration. t1/2 was calculated as the terminal slope of the semilogarithmic drug concentration-time 
curve. 
Statistical analysis 
Pharmacokinetic parameters of paliperidone were determined from plasma concentration-time profiles. 
Statistical analyses were performed using the SAS Statistical Analysis System program in two of the 
key studies to compare treatments by analysis of variance (ANOVA). 
•  Absorption  
The ER OROS tablets have been designed to deliver paliperidone over a 24-hour period. Paliperidone 
showed  some  preference  for  the  secretory  direction,  and  the  efflux  ratio  (secretory/absorptive  Papp) 
decreased  with  increasing  concentration,  indicating  involvement  of  an  efflux  transporter,  e.g.  P-gp. 
When apical pH increased from 6.0 to 8.0, there was a gradual increase in absorptive permeation. P-gp 
inhibitors  (quinidine,  verapamil,  imipramine)  had  a  limited  effect  on  the  transport  of  paliperidone, 
with increased absorptive and decreased secretory transport, while inhibitors of other transporters had 
no effect. Paliperidone inhibited  3H-taxol transport to some extent at the highest concentration tested 
(100 µM) from an excretion ratio of 18 to 10. The positive control verapamil gave an excretion ratio 
of 3. Since paliperidone has an absolute bioavailability of more than 90% after administration as an 
oral solution (Study R076477-P01-1007, see below) and results of the in vitro Caco-2 study support 
that paliperidone can be classified as a highly permeable compound, paliperidone meets the criteria of 
a  Class 2  compound  (low  solubility,  high  permeability)  in  the  Biopharmaceutical  Classification 
System.

•  Bioavailability 
The absolute bioavailability is 28% for the ER OROS formulation and is 106% (complete) for the oral 
solution. The lower bioavailability for the ER OROS formulation is probably due to a higher fraction 
of paliperidone released in the colon, where the absorption is lower. 
The median Tmax for an oral solution occurs at 1.5 hours, whereas the median Tmax of the ER OROS 
tablet  observed  in  various  studies  is  in  the  range  of  20-25  hours,  clearly  indicating  the  extended 
release characteristics of the formulation. The half-life was similar for all formulations, indicating no 
absorption-rate limitation in the PK of ER OROS paliperidone. No difference in Tmax is observed for 
different doses.  
Bioequivalence 
Mean  PK  parameter  estimates  of  the  several  formulations  used  across  the  clinical  development  of 
Invega are presented in Table 6. PK parameters were studied only for the 15 mg strength, and for this 
strength  bioequivalence  between  the  different  formulations  used  across  the  clinical  studies  has  been 
demonstrated.

OROS Commercial (Fasted and Fed) and ER OROS Phase 3 (Fasted) Formulations (Study R076477-P01-1008)

Under fasted conditions, the ER OROS commercial formulation was bioequivalent to the ER OROS 
Phase 3 formulation at the 15 mg dose, based on the CIs for the ratio commercial tablet/Phase 3 tablet 
for Cmax, AUClast and AUC0-∞. Food increased the systemic exposure of paliperidone administered as 
ER OROS commercial tablet by approximately 45%. 
Bioequivalence  has  been  demonstrated  between  the  commercial  formulation  and  the  Phase 3 
formulation, although not using the same tablet strengths. The bioequivalence was established for the 
strength of 15 mg, while in the MAA, the highest strength applied for is 12 mg and not 15 mg. In the 
Phase 3 studies, tablets strengths of 3 and 9 mg were used and therefore the approach to use different 
strengths is acceptable. The different strengths are of the same tablet size and dose proportionality is 
demonstrated  over  the  dose  range  3-15 mg.  Based  on  this,  it  is  considered  that  bioequivalence 
between  the  Phase  3  and  the  commercial  formulation  has been sufficiently established. Considering 
the  minor  difference  of  formulation  and  the  fact  that  dose  linearity  has  been  established  over  all 
strengths with the commercial product (except for 3 mg) this proceeding is deemed tolerable. 
•  Food interaction 
The effect of concomitant food intake on the pharmacokinetics of paliperidone has been evaluated in 
four  pilot  studies,  using  early  formulations,  and  in  two  pivotal  studies,  in  which  the  commercial 
ER OROS tablets were used.  
Table 7: The Effect of Food on PK Parameters of Paliperidone From Different Formulations (Studies R076477-
BEL-1; R076477-P01-1006; R076477-P01-1008; PALIOROS-P01-1012;C-2002-034, C-2004-006). 
Food (standard breakfast) does not affect the pharmacokinetics of paliperidone when administered as 
an  IR  tablet.  However,  an  increased  exposure  is  observed  with  the  ER  OROS formulation,  which  is 
likely  to  be  a  formulation  effect  and  not  a  substance  effect.  In  all  studies  except  one  (C-2004-006), 
food increased the exposure to paliperidone up to 50-60%. Food also increases the variability in Cmax 
and  AUC0-∞  whereas  the  Tmax  and  the  half-life  are  not  altered  to  a  large  extent.  The  observed  food 
effect was likely to be due to a delay in the transit of the ER OROS formulation in the upper part of 
the GI tract, resulting in increased absorption.

During the evaluation the CHMP was concerned because in the key phase 3 studies paliperidone was 
administered in the morning, without specific recommendations of administration in relation to food 
intake.  Considering  the  large  increase  in  exposure  and  the  relatively  steep  concentration  vs.  effect 
relationship  for  EPS,  the  CHMP  recommended  to  standardise  the  administration  of  paliperidone 
ER OROS  in  relation  to  food  intake,  in  order  to  reduce  variability  and  avoid  unnecessarily  high 
exposures. This recommendation was then introduced in the SPC.  
Other factors (e.g. increased GI motility caused by e.g. diarrhoea or certain diets (e.g. vegetarians) or 
certain medicinal product) potentially affecting the absorption from the ER OROS tablets have been 
discussed and appropriate information has been included in the SPC.  
•  Distribution 
Paliperidone  was  rapidly  distributed  into  tissues,  with  a  volume  of  distribution  of  487  L  (based  on 
population PK modelling). Paliperidone distributed well into the brain, as evidenced by displacement 
of  11C-racloprine  measured  using  PET  imaging  in  healthy  subjects.  Within  therapeutically  relevant 
concentrations of 50 to 250 ng/mL, the plasma protein binding was 74% for paliperidone, 82% for (+)-
paliperidone  and  65%  for  (-)-paliperidone,  and  was  not  influenced  by  sex,  age,  or  renal  function. 
Paliperidone and its enantiomers were predominately bound to α1-acid glycoprotein and albumin. In 
patients with moderate hepatic impairment, plasma protein binding was reduced, mainly because of a 
reduction in α1-acid glycoprotein and albumin plasma concentrations.  
•  Elimination 
The plasma clearance of paliperidone (about 80 ml/min) is low relative to hepatic plasma flow (about 
700 ml/min),  and  therefore  paliperidone  can  be  considered  as  a  drug  with  a  low  hepatic  extraction 
ratio. The half-life of paliperidone is 20-25 hours and is independent of dose, route of administration 
and  formulation,  indicating  no  absorption-rate  limitation  in  the  pharmacokinetics  of  ER OROS 
paliperidone. 
•  Excretion 
Paliperidone was mainly excreted in urine (80% of a radiolabelled dose), while only a small part was 
excreted  in  faeces  (11%).  Almost  60%  of  the  dose  was  excreted  as  unchanged  drug  in  urine.  Renal 
clearance of unchanged paliperidone was on average 53 ml/min. About 50% of the renal clearance of 
unchanged  paliperidone  was  by  means  of  filtration  (average  CLGFR:  25.9  ml/min),  the  other  half 
occurred by active processes (average CLact: 27.2 ml/min). 
•  Metabolism 
Paliperidone is not metabolised to a large extent. Almost 60% of the dose was identified as unchanged 
paliperidone in urine. Four metabolites were identified in urine, each of which accounted for up to a 
maximum of 6.5% of the dose, while 7% of the urinary radioactivity remained unidentified. Two small 
metabolites were identified in faeces. 
Metabolite profiling was not possible in plasma, due to low radioactivity levels. Based on the AUC0-24h 
values,  unchanged  paliperidone  represented  approximately  97%  of  the  total  radioactivity  in  plasma 
and therefore the lack of information regarding metabolites in plasma may be accepted.  
In vitro  results  also  indicate  limited  metabolism,  with  some  involvement  of  CYP2D6  and  CYP3A4: 
paliperidone  is  metabolised  to  some  extent  by  CYP2D6  and  mean  Cmax  and  AUC  values  for  poor 
metabolisers  (PMs)  are  somewhat  higher  compared  with  extensive  metabolisers  (EMs),  but  with 
overlapping  individual  values.  Special  dose  recommendations  or  precautions  are  not  warranted  for 
patients who are CYP2D6 PMs. 
Inter-conversion 
• 
In vivo interconversion between the (+)-enantiomer and the (-)-enantiomer is comparable (about 40%) 
in  both  directions  after  oral  administration  of  the  separate  enantiomers.  Since  the  pharmacological 
profiles  of  the  racemate  and  the  2  enantiomers  are  qualitatively  and  quantitatively  similar,  and 
pronounced racemization occurs in vitro with a constant enantiomeric ratio, the applicant decided to 
develop the racemate. The CHMP considered this acceptable. 
•  Comparisons with IR risperidone 
18/58 
©EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After  administration  of  both  paliperidone  and  risperidone  as  IR  dosage  forms,  the  exposure  to 
paliperidone  vs.  active  moiety  was  similar,  while  administration  of  paliperidone  in  the  ER OROS 
dosage form results in a lower bioavailability, lower Cmax and AUC compared with IR paliperidone. 
From  a  safety  perspective,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  exposure  to  paliperidone  is  lower  with 
administration  of  paliperidone  ER OROS  at  the  normal  and  highest  recommended  doses  compared 
with administration of IR risperidone at recommended dose levels. Thus, extrapolations of safety data 
can be made from the previous, extensive use of IR risperidone. 
Pharmacokinetics of metabolites 
• 
Paliperidone is mainly excreted unchanged, consequently the PK of metabolites is deemed negligible. 
•  Consequences of possible genetic polymorphism 
Many subjects in the Phase 1 studies underwent cytochrome P450 genotyping to assess the potential 
impact  of  genetic  polymorphisms  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  paliperidone  and  its  enantiomers.  In 
general,  the  noncompartmental  PK  parameters  of  paliperidone  for  poor  metabolizers  (PMs)  of  the 
CYP2D6 substrate were within the range of values obtained for extensive metabolizers (EMs). Results 
of  a  population  analysis  using  data  from  Phase  1  and  Phase  3  studies  confirmed  that  genetic 
polymorphism  for  the  CYP2D6  isozyme  had  no  discernable  impact  on  the  systemic  clearance  of 
paliperidone,  therefore  special  dose  recommendations  or  precautions  are  not  warranted  for  patients 
who are CYP2D6 PMs. 
•  Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose  proportionality  at  the  dose  levels  3  mg  (Phase  3  ER  OROS  paliperidone  tablet,  F016),  6 mg, 
9 mg,  12  mg  and  15  mg  (commercial  Invega  tablets,  F047,  F048, F049 and F050) was evaluated in 
Study R076477-P01-1010. This was an open-label, randomized, 5-treatment 5-period crossover study 
in healthy males. Fifty subjects received study medication and 45 completed all treatments.

Table 8: Paliperidone Plasma PK Parameters (Mean ± SD) After Single-Dose Administration of ER OROS 
Paliperidone Tablet. (Study R076477-P01-1010). 
Linear  regression  analysis  of  Cmax,  AUClast,  and  AUC0-∞  over  all  dose  levels  (parameters  dose-
normalised to 15 mg) demonstrated dose-proportionality. Dose-proportionality was confirmed for 3, 6, 
9, 12 and 15 mg ER OROS paliperidone tablets based on the pair-wise comparisons with respect to 
Cmax, AUClast and AUC0-∞. All 90%CI of the pair-wise comparisons are within the 80-125%. Thus, the 
3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 mg tablets are bioequivalent after dose-normalisation. 
Median  tmax  was  approximately  24  hours  for  all  dose  levels,  indicating  that  the  prolonged  release 
properties of the commercial Invega tablet were independent of tablet strength. The elimination half-
life was approximately 23 hours and independent of tablet strength. 
The steady state PK of paliperidone has been investigated in schizophrenic patients and the studies and 
the results are described in the section “Pharmacokinetics in target population” below. Steady state has 
generally  been  reached  within  3-6  days  of  once  daily  dosing  in  the  multiple  dose  studies.  An 
accumulation  ratio  of  3.8  was  estimated  in  Study  PAL-SCH-101  based  on  AUC0-24h  values  Days  1 
and 6. No comparison of AUC0-∞ after a single dose vs. AUCτss was available. In Phase 3 studies, the 
plasma concentrations after weeks 2 and 5 respectively were similar and indicated no accumulation of 
paliperidone over time. No differences in plasma concentrations between the predose (24 hours after 
drug  intake,  i.e.  near-peak  concentrations),  1  to  2  hours  postdose  and  more  than  4  hours  postdose 
samples were observed for all visits and all dosing groups. Thus, a low peak to trough variation was 
observed with ER OROS paliperidone. 
Intra- and Inter-individual variability 
• 
The  inter-individual  variability  in  PK  parameters  for  the  ER OROS  formulation  (Cmax  and  AUC 
values)  is  moderate  to  high  (40-50%)  with  a  somewhat  increased  variability  with  concomitant  food 
intake. No data on intra-individual variability have been presented.  
•  Pharmacokinetics in target population 
PK phase 1 studies revealed a delayed Cmax at 24 h for paliperidone extended release tablets, which is 
in line with its in vitro characteristics. The terminal half-life has been found of approximately 23 hours 
on average. To benefit from the 24-hour release profile of ER OROS paliperidone, morning dosing is 
recommended,  and  all  studies  in  the  clinical  development  program  for  this  product  were  consistent 
with this recommendation. 
Steady-state  paliperidone  concentrations  were  attained  within  4  to  5  days  of  dosing  with  ER  OROS 
paliperidone in most subjects. The fluctuation index (peak-to-trough fluctuation) observed with once 
daily  administration  of  ER  OROS  paliperidone  (38%  to  52%)  is  much  lower  than  with  risperidone, 
dosed once daily (125%) or twice daily (74%).  
The low peak-to-trough fluctuation observed with ER OROS paliperidone in the Phase 1 studies was 
confirmed by data from the Phase 3, 6-week double-blind studies (SCH-302, SCH-303, SCH-304, and 
SCH-305). In these studies, there were no apparent differences in paliperidone plasma concentrations 
between predose (i.e., 24 hours after drug intake; equivalent to near-peak concentrations), 1 to 2 hours 
postdose, and more than 4 hours postdose values. Furthermore, plasma drug concentrations measured 
after  2  and  5  weeks  of  fixed  dose  paliperidone  administration  were  consistent  over  time,  indicating 
that no further accumulation of paliperidone occurred.

Population pharmacokinetics 
• 
A population PK analysis was performed with the primary objectives to model the PK of paliperidone 
after oral administration of ER OROS formulation and to estimate the basic PK parameters in healthy 
subjects and patients; to quantify variability of the PK parameters and to evaluate the impact of patient 
and other covariates as potential sources of PK variability of paliperidone.  
A single CL/F parameter described elimination of paliperidone by all routes, including renal and non-
renal pathways. The typical total apparent CL amounted 13.8 l/h (230 ml/min) with a between-subject 
variability  estimated  to  52%.  In  the  co-variate  analysis, lean body mass (LBM) and CLCR explained 
the  intersubject  variability  in  CL  to  a  statistically  significant  extent  in  schizophrenic  and 
schizoaffective  patients.  Thus,  subjects  with  the  lowest  LBM  and  lowest  creatinine  clearance  levels 
were predicted to exhibit the highest paliperidone exposure. None of the other covariates could explain 
the intersubject variability in any of the PK parameters to a statistically significant extent. Initially, the 
covariate effects were only explored graphically and an additional covariate analysis was performed, 
as requested by the CHMP, to confirm the results from the graphical analysis. 
•  Special populations 
impairment  could  be  more  appropriate 
Renal impairment 
The effect of renal impairment was investigated in a single dose study in subjects with varying degrees 
of  renal  impairment  (mild,  moderate,  and  severe)  as  compared  with  subjects  with  normal  renal 
function. Since no subjects with CLCR below 10 ml/min have been studied it is suggested to limit the 
use  of  paliperidone  to  patients  with  a  CLCR  above  10 ml/min.  The  exposure  to  paliperidone  is 
increased  on  average  2.1-3.4-fold  [2.1  (Cmax)  and  3.4  (AUCinf)-fold  in  patients  with  severe  renal 
impairment compared with healthy subjects and the mean half-life is increased to over 50 hours. In the 
SPC initially proposed by the Applicant a daily dose of 6 mg was recommended for patients with mild 
renal  impairment  (creatinine  CL  50-80 ml/min)  and  a  daily  dose  of  3  mg  was  recommended  in 
moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine CL <50 ml/min).  
The  CHMP  suggested  that  a  lower  dose  in  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  compared  with 
patients  with  moderate  renal 
the  proposed 
recommendation. To further establish the doses to be recommended in patients with renal impairment, 
the Applicant used modelling and simulation for prediction of the exposure to paliperidone at steady 
state  with  different  dosing  schedules.  The  population  PK  model  was  used,  but  the  results  were 
inconsistent with results from the Phase I study in renal impairment, since no difference in exposure 
between severe and moderate renal impairment was detected in this analysis. The CHMP requested to 
perform  a  reanalysis,  based  on  the  Phase  I  results.  Additional  nonparametric  superposition  and 
compartmental  PK  analysis  at  the  defined  cut-offs  points  of  CLcr  values  of  10,  29  (severe),  30,  49 
(moderate), 50, 79 (mild), 80 and 120 (normal) mL/min were performed. According to the Sponsor, 
these analyses supported the dose regime initially proposed (3 mg once-a-day in severe and moderate 
renal impairment and 6 mg once-a-day in mild renal impairment). The CHMP view was that, based on 
simulations of steady state plasma levels, the exposure with the proposed doses was predicted to be 
higher  in  patients  with  severe  and  mild  renal  impairment  compared  to  patients  with  normal  renal 
function. The following dose recommendations were therefore applied and included in the final SPC: 
a dose of 3 mg every other day (with the possibility to increase the dose to 3 mg/day) for patients with 
severe  renal  impairment,  and  a  single  daily  dose  of  3  mg  for  patients  with  moderate  or  mild  renal 
impairment,  with  a  possibility  to  increase  the  dose  to  6  mg  once  daily  in  patients  with  mild  renal 
impairment. 
than 
Hepatic impairment 
Based  on  total  plasma  levels,  the  exposure  to  paliperidone  was  decreased  in  patients  with  moderate 
hepatic impairment (Child Pugh class B) compared with healthy subjects. However, the protein levels 
were  lower  and  the  unbound  fraction  higher  in  the  hepatically  impaired  group  and  the  unbound 
exposure  was  similar  in  both  groups.  As  severe  hepatic  impairment  has  not  been  studied,  caution 
should  be  recommended  in  such  patients.  No  dose  adjustment  is  required  in  patients  with  mild  or 
moderate hepatic impairment. This information has been included in the SPC.

Other special populations 
Females had lower CL of paliperidone compared with males, but after correction for body weight and 
plasma protein binding, the unbound CL was comparable between men and women.  
In the population PK analysis, no effect of gender, race or smoking status was observed. 
Elderly 
Study PALIOROS-SCH-1011
The  PK  of  ER  OROS  paliperidone  have  been  explored  in  a  specific  PK  study  (PALIOROS-SCH-
1011)  including  healthy  young  (18-45  years)  and  elderly  (>65  years)  subjects.  Exposure  was 
examined after both single and multiple dose administration of 3 mg ER OROS paliperidone. The 3 
mg dose level was used to ensure safety. 
Steady-state pharmacokinetics in this study were predictable from single dose data, indicating linear 
and time independent pharmacokinetics in the elderly. Elderly subjects had a 20-25% lower clearance 
as compared to young subjects, resulting in higher Cmax, longer half-life and larger AUC. The modest 
increase in paliperidone concentration in elderly subjects indicate that no dosage adjustment is needed 
for ER OROS paliperidone in elderly subjects, and dose adjustments solely on the basis of age have 
not been recommended in the SPC. However, apparent plasma clearance, renal clearance and apparent 
non-renal  clearance  were  affected.  Within  renal  clearance,  most  of  the  difference  with  the  young 
subject  group  after  single  dosing  was  accounted  for  by  a  decrease  in  glomerular  filtration  for  the 
subjects aged from 65 to 74 years, and to both a decrease in active renal clearance and in glomerular 
filtration  in  subjects  aged  ≥75  years.  Results  for  each  enantiomer  were  similar  to  results  for  the 
racemate except that the differences in PK parameters between young and elderly subjects were larger 
for R078543 than for R078544. As a consequence, because elderly patients may have diminished renal 
function, dose adjustments may be required according to their renal function status and doses should 
be reduced in elderly patients with a creatinine clearance of <50 mL/min. 
Study R076477-SCH-302  
This was a double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, parallel group study that evaluated the safety 
and tolerability of flexible doses of ER OROS paliperidone (3 to 12 mg/day) in geriatric subjects with 
schizophrenia (>65 years of age). Blood samples to measure paliperidone plasma concentrations were 
collected  at  limited  time  points  at  Visits  6  and  9  (weeks  2  and  5,  respectively)  of  the  double  blind 
treatment phase (predose, 1 to 2 hours after dosing, and at least 4 hours post dosing).  There were no 
notable  differences  in  dose-normalised  plasma  concentrations  for  the  different  age  groups,  although 
the  number  of  subjects  in  the  older  age  groups  was  rather  small  for  definite  conclusions.  The 
correlation  of  paliperidone  plasma  concentrations  with  safety  parameters  (EPS  rating  scales:  AIMS, 
BARS and SAS, and cardiovascular safety parameters: QTcLD) was explored graphically. There was 
no apparent relationship between plasma concentration and any of the EPS and cardiovascular safety 
parameters or their respective shifts from baseline. 
Children 
No  pharmacokinetic  data  for  paliperidone  have  been  presented  in  children  and  the  product  is  not 
intended for use in patients aged below 18 years and this is reflected in the SPC.  
•  Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Two  in vitro  metabolism  studies  and  two  in vivo  interaction  studies  (with  trimethoprim  and 
paroxetine)  have  been  submitted.  On  the  basis  of  the  in vitro  results,  no  in vivo  studies  addressing 
metabolic interactions were considered necessary. No induction studies have been performed in vitro 
or in vivo and were not deemed necessary. 
• 
In vitro 
Two  in  vitro  studies  in  human  liver  microsomes  showed  that  paliperidone  does  not  substantially 
inhibit  the  metabolism  of  drugs  metabolized  by  CYP  isozymes,  including  CYP1A2,  CYP2A6, 
CYP2C8/9/10, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. Therefore, paliperidone is not expected to 
inhibit  clearance  of  drugs  that  are  metabolized  by  these  metabolic  pathways  in  a  clinically  relevant 
manner. The effect of paliperidone on induction of metabolic enzymes has not been investigated. In 
line  with  observations 
time-independent 
pharmacokinetics,  paliperidone  is  not  expected  to  cause  enzyme  induction  or  inhibition.  As  such, 
paliperidone  is  not  expected  to  inhibit  P-glycoprotein-(P-gp)-mediated  transport  of  other  drugs  in  a 
in  clinical  studies  where  paliperidone  displayed

clinically  meaningful  manner.  An  in vitro  study  showed  that  paliperidone  may  be  a  substrate  and  a 
weak inhibitor of P-gp. No in vivo studies have been performed and the clinical relevance is unknown. 
Paliperidone  binds  primarily  to  α1-acid  glycoprotein  and  albumin.  In  vitro,  high  therapeutic 
concentrations  of  diazepam  (3  μg/mL),  sulfamethazine  (100  μg/mL),  warfarin  (10  μg/mL)  and 
carbamazepine  (10  μg/mL)  (all  bound  to  albumin)  caused  a  slight,  though  statistically  significant 
increase  in  the  free  fraction  of  paliperidone  (at  50  ng/mL),  with  a  maximum  increase  of  12%  (by 
carbamazepine,  from  22.9  to 25.7%). Based upon these data, drug interaction at the level of protein 
binding is considered unlikely. 
• 
In vivo 
The main elimination route of paliperidone is renal excretion and about half of this is through active 
secretion  in  the  renal  tubule.  Only  one  in vivo  interaction  study  was  performed  with  paliperidone, 
addressing  the  potential  interaction  with  trimethoprim  on  the  renal,  secretory  level.  Trimethoprim, 
which was chosen due to its inhibitory effect on the organic cation transporter, had only small effects 
on  the  PK  of  paliperidone,  e.g.  an  increase  in  Cmax  and  decreased  AUC  of  total  paliperidone,  and 
unbound CL/F and AUC were not different. In the Caco-2 study described above, trimethoprim had no 
effect on the transport of paliperidone either. Furthermore, there was no indication that paliperidone 
affected the PK of trimethoprim at steady state, and a drug interaction at the level of renal secretion is 
considered unlikely. 
In the Day 120 response, a new interaction study with paroxetine was included. Multiple dosing with 
paroxetine  caused  increases  in  Cmax  and  AUC  of  a  single  dose  of  paliperidone  by  10-15%.  This 
increase is not considered clinically relevant. 
In a published study, the effect of the P-gp inhibitor verapamil on the PK of risperidone was evaluated 
in  Japanese  subjects,  and  the  exposure  to  risperidone  and  paliperidone  increased  61%  and  30%, 
respectively, while the half-lives were not affected. Effects of P-gp inhibitors directly on paliperidone 
are difficult to predict based on these data.  
Following the CHMP request, the Applicant has discussed the potential for P-gp inhibitors to affect 
paliperidone. Results from in vitro data suggest that the potential for interactions may be low, but firm 
conclusions  are  difficult  to  make  in  the  absence  of  human  in  vivo  data.  As  a  result,  following  the 
CHMP request, the potential for an interaction has been addressed in the SPC. 
Results  from  a  population  PK  analysis  showed  that  concomitant  administration  of  drugs  with  P-gp 
inducing/inhibiting properties during Phase 3 efficacy and safety studies had no significant impact on 
systemic exposure to paliperidone.  
Derived by the presented PK data no severe interactions can be anticipated for paliperidone with other 
drugs. However, due to the limitations of the analysis described above, no definite conclusions can be 
drawn. 
Pharmacodynamics 
•  Mechanism of action 
Paliperidone 
is  a  monoaminergic  antagonist  with  a  high  affinity  for  serotoninergic  (5-
hydroxytryptamine [5-HT] type 2A [5HT2A]) and dopaminergic D2 receptors. Paliperidone binds also 
to α1-adrenergic receptors, and, with lower affinity, to H1-histaminergic and α2-adrenergic receptors. It 
has no affinity for cholinergic, muscarinic, or β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors. 
•  Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Paliperidone  is  the  main  metabolite  of  risperidone  and  its  pharmacological  profile  is  very  similar  to 
that of risperidone. No essential new pharmacodynamics effects are expected.  
Effects on sleep/wake cycle 
Results  of  a  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  fixed  dose,  2-week 
polysomnography  study  of  ER  OROS  paliperidone  9  mg  once  daily  in  subjects  with  schizophrenia-
related insomnia indicated that treatment was associated with a statistically significant improvement in 
sleep  architecture  and  sleep  continuity.  Specifically,  among  subjects  treated  with  ER  OROS 
paliperidone, the following mean improvements relative to placebo were observed: reduced latency to 
persistent sleep of 41.0 minutes, decreased sleep onset latency by 35.2 minutes, decreased number of 
awakenings after sleep onset by 7.0 events, increased total sleep time by 52.8 minutes, increased sleep 
23/58

period time by 41.7 minutes, and increased sleep efficiency index by 11%. Treatment with ER OROS 
paliperidone was also associated with a statistically significant decrease (relative to placebo) in Stage 
1 sleep of 11.9 minutes and increase in Stage 2 Sleep of 50.7 minutes. No clinically relevant effect on 
REM sleep was observed. 
Secondary pharmacology  
• 
Orthostatic hypotension 
One  of  the  reasons  for  developing  an  ER  formulation  was  to  allow  treatment  initiation  with  an 
efficacious dose without having to start at a lower dose in order to reduce the possibility of orthostatic 
side  effects.  Reduction  of  the  occurrence  of  orthostatic  hypotension  at  the  start  of  therapy  was  the 
outcome used in the selection of the most desirable extended release profile. However, there was no 
clear  apparent  relationship  between  the  paliperidone  plasma  concentrations  and  the  change  in 
orthostatic systolic blood pressure in study PAL-SCH-101 based on a non-inferiority comparison. 
Prolactin 
Serum prolactin concentrations have been evaluated. After single or multiple dose administration of IR 
paliperidone  in  healthy  subjects  and  subjects  with  schizophrenia,  prolactin  concentrations  increased 
and  peaked  approximately  1-2  hour  after  dosing  and  decreased  thereafter.  An  ascending  plasma 
profile, due to extended release, resulted in lower prolactin Cmax and AUC as compared to a lower dose 
of IR paliperidone or risperidone (Studies C-2001-039 and C-2002-019). 
Effect on QT/QTc 
The  effect  of  paliperidone  on  cardiovascular  safety,  particularly  on  QT/QTc  prolongation,  was 
assessed  in  a  thorough  cardiovascular  safety  Study  (R076477-SCH-1009;  see  table  below).  The 
PK/PD analysis suggests that effects of paliperidone on QTcLD are complex and cannot be explained 
by plasma concentrations only. Although plasma concentrations measured around Cmax coincide with 
the maximum effect on QTcLD change baseline, the PK/PD relationship seems to be more complex. 
In conclusion, the risk of QTcLD prolongation seems to be similar to risperidone, which is reflected in 
the SPC. 
The complete discussion of the thorough QT/Qc study and the Phase 3 results concerning the effects 
of paliperidone on the QT interval are presented in the Clinical Safety section of this report. 
Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) 
The effect of paliperidone on the incidence of EPS was analysed using a hazard model, which related 
the  EPS-incidence  to  average  steady  state  paliperidone  plasma  concentrations.  EPS-incidence 
24/58 
©EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
increased gradually between 5 mg and 10 mg. Below 5 mg (steady state plasma concentrations up to 
20 ng/ml) there was no additional EPS-risk compared to placebo, while at doses above 10 mg the risk 
quickly reached its plateau of approximately 30% compared to about 10% for placebo. 
The EC50 was estimated to be 24 ng/ml, which corresponds to a D2-receptor occupancy of about 83% 
(KD  app:  4.9±0.53  ng/mL).  This  is  consistent  with  other  reports  in  the  literature  that  suggest  that 
increased risk to develop EPS is associated with D2-receptor occupancies of > 80%. 
The PK/PD EPS model was also used to assess the impact of food intake on the probability to develop 
EPS  during  paliperidone  administration.  There  is  a  relatively  steep  rise  in  EPS  incidence  between 
concentrations  of  20  and  40 ng/ml.  The  relationship  seems  less  steep  when  doses  are  viewed,  but 
considering the placebo incidence of 10% and a maximum incidence of 30%, the incidence with food 
compared with administration in the fasting state appears to result in an approximately doubled EPS 
incidence.  In  order  to  reduce  variability  in  exposure,  the  CHMP  proposed  to  recommend 
standardisation  of  paliperidone  ER  OROS  administration  in  relation  to  food  intake.  As  a  result,  the 
Applicant introduced this recommendation in the SPC. 
•  Relationship Between Plasma Concentration And Effect 
Based  on  data  from  PET  studies,  a  relationship  between  paliperidone  plasma  concentrations  and  D2 
receptor  occupancy  was  found,  and  plasma  concentrations  needed  to  achieve  an  effect  on 
schizophrenic symptoms were fairly well defined. A dose range for ER OROS paliperidone that would 
lead to a receptor occupancy of 70-80%, which is likely to be efficacious, was estimated to be between 
4.5  and  9  mg  (10-20  ng/ml),  using  the  Emax-model,  while  doses  resulting  in  plasma  concentrations 
above 19.6 ng/ml (>80% receptor occupancy) could be associated with a higher incidence of adverse 
events associated with central D2 receptor antagonism. Based on this, the dose range of 3 to 15 mg ER 
OROS paliperidone was evaluated for efficacy and safety in the pivotal Phase 3 studies. 
Figure 3: D2-Receptor Occupancy vs. Paliperidone Plasma Concentration (Studies R076477-SIV-101 and 
R076477-SWE-1) 
PK/PD  analyses  were  performed  with  respect  to  dose/exposure  and  PANSS  (Positive  and  Negative 
Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia) and EPS (Extrapyramidal Symptoms) relationships. The effect of 
paliperidone  on  the  endpoint  PANSS  and  responder  rates  could  be  described  by  an  Emax  model.  An 
ED50  of  approximately  2.45  mg  was  estimated,  with  a  high  uncertainty,  though.  Replacing  dose  by 
concentration  did  not  improve  the  precision  of  the  model  parameters.  Dose-response  modelling 
suggested that 3 mg is close to the minimal effective dose and located on the linear part of the dose 
response curve, whereas it is uncertain whether 2 mg would yield a relevant response rate. A dose of 1 
mg is likely to be an ineffective dose. 
The  correlation  of  plasma  concentrations  of  paliperidone  with  safety  parameters  (EPS  rating  scales: 
AIMS, BARS and SAS, and cardiovascular safety parameters: QTcLD) was explored graphically for 
four Phase 3 studies. The scatterplots showed no apparent relationship between plasma concentration 
and any of the assessed EPS and cardiovascular safety parameters.

•  Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances  
No specific studies are available. Based on the in vitro and in vivo PK properties of paliperidone, the 
probability  of  drug-drug  interactions  is  low.  Considering  the  drug’s  primary  effects  on  the  CNS, 
paliperidone  should  be  administered  with  caution  in  combination  with  other  centrally  active  drugs. 
Paliperidone may antagonize the effects of levodopa and other dopamine agonists.  Due to its alpha>-
adrenergic  receptor  antagonism,  paliperidone  has  the  potential  to  enhance  the  effect  of  certain 
antihypertensive agents. Appropriate information has been included in the SPC. 
•  Genetic differences in PD response 
No data is available. A review of publications on paliperidone (as metabolite of risperidone) indicated 
that  exposure  to  paliperidone  in  diverse  groups  of  subjects  that  included  subjects  with  genetic 
polymorphisms was generally tolerated. 
Clinical efficacy  
•  Dose response study(ies) 
No specific dose response studies were performed prior to the main clinical studies. The selection of 
doses  for  these  studies  was  based  on  the  pharmacological  relationship  with  risperidone  for  which  a 
dose  between  2  mg  and  6  mg  is  usually  recommended,  corresponding  to  6-18  mg  ER  OROS 
paliperdone. Furthermore, from the receptor occupancy studies it was estimated that 4.5-9 mg would 
result in the desired D2-receptor occupancy of 70-80%.  
•  Main study(ies)  
The pivotal studies were designed to determine both short-term efficacy and maintenance of effect. 
Short-term efficacy 
Short-term  efficacy  has  been  studied  in  three  placebo-controlled,  dose-response,  fixed  dose  studies 
(SCH-303, SCH-304 and SCH-305) as well as in a flexible dose study in elderly patients (study SCH-
302). The fixed dose studies also included olanzapine as an active comparator (Table 10). 
Table 10: Treatment assignments in the four short-term phase III studies. 
Methods (studies SCH-303, SCH-304 and SCH-305) 
The studies SCH-303, SCH-304, and SCH-305 were randomised, double-blind, placebo- and active-
controlled,  parallel-group,  dose-response  phase  III  trials.  These  three  main  studies  used  the  same 
methodology, which is therefore presented collectively in the present report. 
Study Participants 
• 
To be enrolled in the studies the patients should be male or female, 18 years of age or older, fulfil the 
DSM-IV  criteria  for  schizophrenia  at  least  one  year  before  screening,  and  experiencing  an  acute 
episode, with a total PANSS score at screening between 70 and 120. Patients with any other DSM-IV 
axis  I  diagnosis  as  well  as  patients  treated  with  depot  antipsychotics,  antidepressants  (unless  on  a 
stable  dose  for  at  least  three  months)  or  mood  stabilizers  within  different  specified  time  limits  were 
excluded.  A  documented  history  of  lack  of  response  to  risperidone  was  another  exclusion  criterion.

Finally,  patients  who  experienced  a  >25%  decrease  in  PANSS  total  score  between  screening  and 
baseline were not eligible to continue in the study. 
Design and treatments 
• 
After  a  screening  phase  of  up  to  five  days  the  patients  were  randomized  to  six  weeks  double-blind 
treatment with pre-selected fixed doses of paliperidone (see Table 10 above), placebo or olanzapine 10 
mg. There was no titration except in Study SCH-305 where patients randomised to 15 mg were given 
12  mg  for  one  week.  Patients  were  hospitalized  from  the  first  day  of  double-blind  treatment  for  a 
minimum of 14 days. 
Endpoints 
• 
Primary endpoint was the change from baseline in total score of the Positive and Negative Syndrome 
Scale  (PANSS;  Kay  et  al.  1987).  The  PANSS  is  a  30-item  rating  scale  for  the  psychopathology  of 
schizophrenia  and  related  disorders  and  includes  a  positive  scale,  a  negative  scale  and  a  general 
psychopathology  scale.  Secondary  endpoints  included  responders  (at  least  30%  reduction  from 
baseline  PANSS  total  score),  change  from  baseline  in  the  Personal  and  Social  Performance  (PSP) 
scale,  Clinical  Global  Impression  of  Severity  (CGI-S),  the  Symptoms  and  Quality  of  Life  in 
Schizophrenia  (SQLS)  scale  and  a  Visual  Analogue  Scale  (VAS)  for  sleep.  All  scales  but  PSP  are 
recognised and commonly used in the evaluation of drugs for treatment of schizophrenia. 
PSP  is  intended  to  reflect  the  patients  functioning  and  measure  the  degree  of  difficulties  a  subject 
exhibits over a one month period within four domains of behaviour: socially useful activities, personal 
and  social  relationships,  self-care,  and  disturbing  and  aggressive  behaviour.  The  total  score  ranges 
from 1 to 100, Subjects with scores 71 to 100 have mild degree of difficulties; from 31 to 70, varying 
degrees of disability; and 30 or less, functioning so poorly that intensive supervision is required. 
Randomisation and blinding 
• 
The  randomisation  was  centralised,  balanced  by  using  permuted  blocks,  and  was  stratified  by  study 
centre.  During  the  double-blind  phase  all  study  medications  were  over-encapsulated  to  preserve  the 
blind. 
Statistical methods 
• 
The  primary  analysis  population  was  the  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  population  defined  as  all  randomised 
patients who received at least one dose of study medication and had at least one post-baseline efficacy 
assessment.  For  missing  values  the  last  observation  carried  forward  (LOCF)  approach  was  used.  In 
alternative analyses the observed cases (OC) approach was used. 
Adjustment  for  multiplicity  was  applied  at  two  levels.  First,  for  the  primary  analysis  of  the  PANSS 
total  score  and  for  the  secondary  variable  PSP  score  Dunnett’s  method  was  used  to  adjust  for  the 
multiple  paliperidone  dosing  group  comparisons  against  placebo.  Second,  for  each  dosing  group 
shown  to  be  significant  in  the  primary  analysis,  the  family  wise  type  I  error  for  the  analyses  of  the 
secondary variables PSP, CGI-S and SQLS scores was controlled at 0.05. 
Change  from  baseline  was  analysed  with  analysis  of  covariance  (ANCOVA)  with  treatment  and 
analysis  centre  as  factors  and  baseline  score  as  covariate.  Categorical  data,  e.g.  percentage  of 
responders, were analysed with the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, controlling for analysis centre. 
RESULTS 
Study SCH-303 
Participant flow and withdrawal information 
• 
Six hundred and thirty patients were randomised and only one and two patients were excluded from 
the safety and ITT-efficacy populations, respectively. The number of withdrawals was fairly similar in 
the  paliperidone  and  olanzapine  groups  and  differed  from  the  placebo  group  where  there  was  an 
excess of withdrawals due to lack of effect (Figure 4).

Figure 4: Withdrawal information for Study SCH-303. 
The  time  pattern  for  total  number  of  withdrawals  was  similar  for  all groups up to Day 21 when the 
higher withdrawal rate in the placebo group became apparent (Figure 5). 
Figure 5: Time to withdrawal in Study SCH-303. 
Baseline data 
• 
There  were  no  pronounced  imbalances  between  the  treatment  groups  with  respect  to  demographic 
data, concomitant diseases or psychiatric history. Eighty-eight % of the patients were between 18 and 
50 years of age. Females were well represented (48%). Patients of white race dominated (86%). The 
schizophrenia type was paranoid in 83% of the cases  and 87% of the patients had at least one prior 
hospitalization for psychosis. The CGI-S score was “marked” or worse for 62% of the patients. 
Outcomes and estimation 
• 
In  the  analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint,  change  from  baseline  in  PANSS  total  score,  effects 
statistically  significantly  superior  to  placebo  (all  p<0.001)  were  demonstrated  for  all  paliperidone 
doses (Table 11). The magnitude of effect was comparable to the effect of olanzapine. The difference

from  placebo  in  the  LS  mean  change  was  larger  in  the  12  mg  group  (-18.9)  than  either  the  6  mg  (-
13.7) or 9 mg (-13.5) groups.

In the primary ITT-LOCF analysis the effect size relative to placebo increased over time (Figure 6) in 
contrast to the ITT-OC analysis where the effect size relative to placebo decreased after three weeks 
(Figure 7). This is explained by the large number of withdrawals due to lack of effect after three weeks 
in the placebo group (Figure 8).

In  the  responder  analyses  significantly  more  responders  were  observed  in  all  paliperidone  groups 
(56%,  51%  and  61%  in  the  6  mg,  9  mg  and  12  mg  groups,  respectively,  p<0.001  for  all  doses) 
compared to the placebo group (30%). 
The results for other secondary variables are given in Table 12. An effect comparable to the effect of 
olanzapine and significantly different from placebo was generally demonstrated. Quality of sleep was 
improved without an increase in daytime drowsiness.

Study SCH-304 
Participant flow and withdrawal information 
• 
Four  hundred  and  forty-four  patients  were  randomised  and  five  and  twelve  patients  were  excluded 
from the safety and ITT-efficacy populations, respectively. The withdrawal pattern in Study SCH-304 
is similar to the pattern in Study SCH-303, although the excess withdrawal in the placebo group after 
three weeks is less pronounced (Figure 9).

Baseline data 
• 
The patients differed from Study SCH-303 with respect to gender distribution (26% females) and race 
(43%  white,  55%  black).  Otherwise  baseline  characteristics  were  similar  to  Studies  SCH-303  and 
SCH-305.  There  were  no  pronounced  imbalances  between  the  treatment  groups  with  respect  to 
demographic data, concomitant diseases or psychiatric history. 
Outcomes and estimation 
• 
In  the  analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint,  change  from  baseline  in  PANSS  total  score,  effects 
statistically  significantly  superior  to  placebo  (p=0.006  for  6  mg  and  p<0.001  for  12  mg)  were 
demonstrated for both paliperidone doses (Table 13). The magnitude of effect was comparable to the 
effect of olanzapine. The difference from placebo in the LS mean change was slightly larger in the 12 
mg group (-8.5) than the 6 mg (-7.0) group.

In the ITT-OC analysis, similar to study SCH-303, the effect size relative to placebo peaked at three 
weeks.  Again,  this  is  probably  explained  by  the  larger  number  of  withdrawals  due  to  lack  of  effect 
after three weeks in the placebo group. 
In  the  responder  analyses  significantly  more  responders  were  observed  in  both  paliperidone  groups 
(50%,  p=0.025  and  51.4%,  p=0.012  in  the  6  mg  and  12  mg  groups,  respectively)  compared  to  the 
placebo group (34.3%). 
The results for other secondary variables are given in Table 14. The overall pattern is consistent with 
results of Study SCH-303, although the effect sizes are smaller and some occasional significances are 
lacking.

Study SCH-305 
Participant flow and withdrawal information 
• 
Six hundred and eighteen patients were randomised and four and thirteen patients were excluded from 
the safety and ITT-efficacy populations, respectively. The withdrawal was dose-dependent with most 
withdrawals on placebo and fewest on the highest paliperidone dose. The withdrawal differences were 
mostly due to discontinuations because of lack of effect (Figure 10). 
Figure 10: Withdrawal information for Study SCH-305. 
Baseline data 
• 
The  patients  differed  from  Study  SCH-303  and  SCH-304  with  respect  to  gender  distribution  (32% 
females  versus  26%  in  SCH-304)  and  ethnic  appearance  49%  white,  21%  black,  24%  asian). 
Otherwise  baseline  characteristics  were  similar  for  the  three  studies.  There  were  no  pronounced 
imbalances between the treatment groups with respect to demographic data, concomitant diseases or 
psychiatric history. 
Outcomes and estimation 
• 
In  the  analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint,  change  from  baseline  in  PANSS  total  score,  statistically 
significant effects compared to placebo (p<0.001) were demonstrated for all paliperidone doses (Table 
15). The magnitude of effect was comparable to the effect of olanzapine. The difference from placebo 
in the LS mean change was larger in the 15 mg group (-17.2) than in either the 3 mg (-11.6) or 9 mg (-
12.9) groups.

In  the  responder  analyses  significantly  more  responders  were  observed  in  all  paliperidone  groups

Maintenance of effect 
Maintenance  of  effect  has  been  investigated  in  a  relapse  prevention  study  (study  SCH-301)  and  in 
open label extensions of the short-term studies. 
Study SCH-301  
Study Participants 
Methods 
• 
To  be  enrolled  in  this  study  the  patients  should  be  male  or  female,  18  to  65  years  of  age,  fulfil  the 
DSM-IV  criteria  for  schizophrenia  at  least  one  year  before  screening,  and  experiencing  an  acute 
episode, with a total PANSS score at screening between 70 and 120. Patients with any other DSM-IV 
34/58 
©EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
axis I diagnosis were excluded. A documented history of lack of response to risperidone was another 
exclusion criterion. 
Design and treatments 
• 
After a 5-day screening phase eligible patients were treated in an open label 8-week run-in phase with 
flexible doses of paliperidone (3 to 15 mg). Patients who tolerated the paliperdone treatment, were on 
a stable paliperidone dose during the last two weeks of the run-in phases and experienced control of 
acute  symptoms  defined  as  PANSS  total  score  of  ≤70;  PANSS  scores  on  individual  items  (P1 
[delusions],  P2  [conceptual  disorganization],  P3  [hallucinatory  behavior],  P6  [suspiciousness/ 
persecution], P7 [hostility] and G8 [uncooperativeness]) of ≤4 (moderate or less), and a CGI-S score 
of  ≤4  (moderately  ill  or  better),  were  eligible  for  a  6-week  open  label  stabilization  phase.  Finally 
patients  remaining  on  a  stable  dose  and  still  fulfilling  the  symptom  control  criteria  were  randomly 
assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to placebo or flexibly dosed paliperidone (3 to 15 mg). 
Endpoints 
• 
The primary efficacy variable was time to the first recurrence event. Recurrence was defined as any of 
the following criteria:  
•  Psychiatric  hospitalization  (involuntary  or  voluntary  admission  to  a  psychiatric  hospital  for 
decompensation of the subject’s schizophrenic symptoms), or 
• For PANSS: 
– Increase of 25% in the total PANSS score from randomization for 2 consecutive days if 
the score at randomization was >40, or 
– A 10-point increase in the total PANSS score from randomization for 2 consecutive days 
if the score at randomization was ≤40, or 
•  Deliberate  self-injury  and/or  violent  behaviour  resulting  in  clinically  significant  injury  to  the 
subject or another person or property damage, or 
•  Suicidal  or  homicidal  ideation  and  aggressive  behaviour  that  was  clinically  significant  (in 
frequency and severity) in the investigator’s judgment, or 
• For CGI-S: 
–  A  score  of  ≥4  after  randomisation  for  2  consecutive  days  if  CGI-S  score  was  ≤  3  at 
randomization, or 
– A score of ≥5 after randomisation for 2 consecutive days if CGI-S was 4 at randomization, 
or 
• For PANSS items P1 (delusions), P2 (conceptual disorganization), P3 (hallucinatory behaviour), 
P6 (suspiciousness/persecution), P7 (hostility) or G8 (uncooperativeness):

Results 
Participant flow and withdrawal information 
• 
Five hundred and thirty patients were included in the run-in phase, 312 continued into the stabilization 
phase and 207 were finally randomised.  There were more dropouts in the paliperidone group, mainly 
due to subject choice (Figure 11).

Baseline data 
• 
In the all treated population 86% of the patients were between 18 and 50 years of age.  One patient 
was 17 years old. A majority of the patients were of white ethnic appearance (53%) and 10% were of 
Hispanic origin. Seventy-two % had had at least one hospitalization for psychosis prior to the study. 
The baseline characteristics were similar for the patients actually randomised and there were no major 
imbalances between the two treatment groups. 
Outcomes and estimation 
• 
The  study  was  terminated  early  due  a  significant  effect  in  a  predefined  interim  analyses  (p=0.0053, 
less  than  the  predefined  stopping  criterion  of  0.0102).  Roughly  twice  as  many  patients  had  a 
recurrence on placebo compared with paliperidone (Figure 12). In a final analysis including patients 
randomised  after  the  cut-off  date  for  the  interim  analysis  the  treatment  difference  was  more 
pronounced (p<0.001).

•  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
A  pooled  analysis  of  the  efficacy  data  of  the  phase  III  studies  was  performed.  This  analysis  is  a 
mixture  of  randomised  comparisons  and  between  study  comparisons,  e.g.  there  is  no  randomised 
comparison between paliperidone 12 mg and 15 mg. The analysis confirmed that higher doses were 
more effective than lower doses (as seen in the individual studies). However, in the pooled analysis 
there  was  no  indication  that  15  mg  should  be  more  effective  than  12  mg.  In  addition,  a  dose 
relationship  for  safety  has  been  observed  with  several  of  the  common  adverse  events  being  more 
frequent  on  the  15  mg  dose,  indicating  that  a  flexible  dosage  of  3-12  mg  is  a  reasonable 
recommendation. 
Pooled analyses of subpopulations 
Pooled analyses of studies SCH-303, SCH-304 and SCH-305 have been performed to investigate the 
impact  of  age  (18-25  years  of  age,  26-50  years of age, and older than 50 years of age), gender (the 
female representation in the clinical studies ranged from 26 to 48%) and ethnic origin. The magnitude 
of effect was similar in all age groups, as well as for white, black and patients of Asian origin. Similar 
effects were demonstrated also for both genders. 
•  Clinical studies in special populations 
Study SCH-302 in geriatric subjects with schizophrenia 
This  study  was  designed  to  determine  short-term  safety  and  efficacy  of  flexibly  dosed  ER  OROS 
paliperidone  (3,  6,  9  and  12  mg)  in  the  elderly  population.  This  trial  was  a  randomized  (2:1  ratio 
paliperidone  ER  OROS:placebo),  6-week,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  multicenter  study.  Male 
and female patients aged 65 years or older with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia for at least one 
year were included. 
Participant flow and withdrawal information 
• 
A total of 114 patients were randomised and no patient was excluded from the safety and ITT-efficacy 
populations.  The  withdrawal  rate  was  twice  as  high  in  the  placebo  group,  mostly  due  more 
withdrawals because of lack of effect (Figure 13).

•  Baseline data 
More than half of the patients were between 64 and 69 years of age (paliperidone 57%, placebo 61%). 
The paliperidone group had a lower proportion of patients between 70 and 75 years of age (25% vs 
34%), and a higher proportion of patients older than 75 years (18% vs 5%). Apart from this imbalance 
the  baseline  characteristics,  concomitant  diseases  and  psychiatric  history  were  generally  similar 
between the two treatment groups. 58% of the patients had a CGI-S rating of “marked” or worse, and 
89%  had  been  hospitalized  at  least  twice  prior  to  the  study;  62%  were  hospitalized  for  psychosis  at 
least four times prior to the study. 
•  Outcomes and estimation 
In  the  analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint,  change  from  baseline  in  PANSS  total  score,  a  fairly  high 
placebo response was noted. Despite this, there was a significant difference in favour of paliperidone 
(Table 17). The difference was statistically significant (p<0.05) from two weeks and the magnitude of 
effect tended to increase over time.

While  the  effect  size  tended  to  increase  with  time  in  the  ITT-LOCF  analysis,  it  was  more  or  less 
constant from two weeks in the ITT-OC analysis. 
In the responder analysis, 38% of subjects in the ER OROS paliperidone group demonstrated a 30% or 
greater  reduction  from  baseline  in  PANSS  total  score,  compared  to  29%  in  the  placebo  group.  This 
difference was not significant. 
The  results  for  other  variables  are  given  in  Table  18.  Apart  from  the  PANSS  subscales  for  positive 
symptoms, negative symptoms and anxiety/depression, there were no significant differences between 
the treatments.

•  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The CHMP considered the clinical program for paliperidone in schizophrenia adequate with respect to 
experimental design, diagnostic criteria and study endpoints. In three phase III studies the short-term 
effect of different doses of paliperidone in the treatment of an acute episode of schizophrenia has been 
compared  to  placebo  with  olanzapine  as  an  active  reference.  The  outcome  of  the  short-term  studies 
compares well with what has been demonstrated for other drugs for the treatment of an acute episode 
of schizophrenia. A consistent effect for all doses relative to placebo has been demonstrated and the 
magnitude  of  effect  is  similar  to  the  effect  of  olanzapine.  The  difference  compared  to  placebo  in 
change from baseline in PANSS total score ranges between -7 and -19, with most of the comparisons 
between  -13  and  -19.  There  were  15  to  35%  more  responders  in  the  active  groups  compared  to 
placebo.  Both  with  respect  to  PANSS  total  score  and  responders  there  was  a  trend  for  better  effect 
with higher doses and there were some significant differences between doses in the individual studies. 
There was no direct comparison between 12 and 15 mg, and within the recommended dose range there 
were  two  direct  comparisons  between  6  and  12  mg.  Some  differences  in  change  from  baseline  in 
PANSS total score were observed, however, the clinical relevance of these differences is questionable. 
However, several adverse events were reported more frequently for 15 mg, therefore the recommended 
dose range (3-12 mg) seems reasonable. Within the recommended dose range there were more adverse 
events  on  the  higher  dose,  in  particular  26%  experienced  EPS-related  adverse  events  on  12  mg 
compared to 10% on 6 mg. Thus, the recommended starting dose (6 mg) seems reasonable as well. A 
significant, but less pronounced effect has been demonstrated in elderly patients (65 years of age or 
older). The female representation in the clinical studies ranged from 26 to 48%. Similar effects were 
demonstrated for both sexes. 
Controlled data on maintenance of effect consist of a so called recurrence prevention study. However, 
since patients were included during an acute episode and most of the separation of the recurrence-free 
curves  occurred  during  the  first  weeks  after  randomisation,  the  CHMP  objected  that  relapse  rather 
than recurrence prevention had been demonstrated. Nevertheless, relapse prevention provides support 
for  maintenance  of  effect,  and  the  Sponsor  suggested  to  include  maintenance  treatment  in  the 
therapeutic  indication,  and  proposed  the  following  text  for  Section  4.1.  of  the  SPC:  “INVEGA  is 
indicated  for  schizophrenia,  including  acute  treatment  and  maintenance  treatment  in  patients  who 
have shown an initial treatment response”. The CHMP was of the view that, for a drug to be approved 
for  treatment  of  schizophrenia,  acute  treatment  as  well  as  maintenance  treatment  have  to  be 
demonstrated,  and  that  for  a  recently  approved  drug  with similar documentation Section 4.1. of the 
SPC  reads  “Invega  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  schizophrenia”.  As  a  result,  the  “treatment  of 
schizophrenia” has been agreed upon as the indication for Invega, and this is reflected in the SPC.

Clinical safety 
The  clinical  safety  database  of  Invega  comprises  the  results  of  5  completed  Phase  3  trials  and  their 
(on-going) open-label extensions during which 2054 subjects with schizophrenia were exposed to ER 
OROS  paliperidone,  along  with  data  from  28  Phase  1/2a  studies  involving  more  than  1100  healthy 
subjects  or  subjects  with  schizophrenia,  most  of  whom  received  an  IR  or  ER  formulation  of 
paliperidone. 
Subjects  with  significant  or  unstable  cardiovascular  or  endocrine  disease  were  excluded  from 
participation  in  the  Phase  3  efficacy  and  safety  studies.  Diabetes,  dyslipidemia,  and  cardiovascular 
disease were reported as comorbid conditions at study entry for between 2 and 5% of adult subjects 
with schizophrenia comprising the Pooled Double-blind, Study SCH-301, or Pooled Open-label Safety 
Analysis Sets. Rates of comorbid diabetes and cardiovascular disease were higher among the elderly 
subjects with schizophrenia enrolled in Study SCH-302 (12% and 43%, respectively). 
•  Patient exposure 
Patient exposure in phase 3 studies  
A total of 2326 subjects with schizophrenia are included in the safety analyses of the phase 3 double-
blind studies (see Table 19), including 1682 adults in the 3 studies SCH-303, SCH-304, and SCH-305 
and  114  elderly  adults  in  study  SCH-302.  Of  the  1796  subjects  in  these  4  studies,  1039  received 
double-blind ER OROS paliperidone, 393 received placebo, and 364 received olanzapine. A total of 
530  subjects  received  at  least  1  dose  of  ER  OROS  paliperidone  in  the  open-label,  run-in  phase  of 
Study  SCH-301.  Two  hundred  seven  of  these  subjects  were  randomly  assigned  to  receive  placebo 
(N=102) or ER OROS paliperidone (N=105) during the double-blind phase of the study. 
A total of 1170 subjects had received open-label ER OROS paliperidone in the 4 studies SCH-702, -
703,  -704,  and  -705  as  of  1  November  2005.  235  subjects  were  enrolled  in  Study  SCH-701  as  of  1 
November 2005. 
Overall, in the combined double-blind and open-label phases of SCH-301/701, -302/702, -303/703, -
304/704,  and  -305/705,  2054  subjects  had  received  ER  OROS  paliperidone  treatment  through  the  1 
November 2005 cut-off date. 
Following  the  CHMP  request,  the  Applicant  submitted  updated  long-term  safety  data  information, 
summarized  with  a  cut-off  date  of  26  June  2006  (31  August  2006  for  deaths  and  serious  adverse 
events): the combined exposure to paliperidone ER in Phase 3 clinical trials in 2054 adults and elderly 
subjects with schizophrenia was 1092.88 subject-years. This represents an increase of 171.57 patient-
years.  Across  all  Phase  3  studies,  562  subjects  were  treated  for  more  than  1  year  (>52  weeks), 
including 415 (27%) subjects in the pooled Phase 3 studies (R076477-SCH-302, -303, -304, -305, -
702, -703, -704 and –705) and 147 (28%) subjects in studies (R076477-SCH-301/701).

Table 19: Phase 3 double-blind studies contributing to clinical safety data. 
Patient exposure in phase 1/2a studies 
In the 28 phase 1/2a studies, 1122 subjects were enrolled, including 383 subjects with schizophrenia 
and  739  non-schizophrenic  subjects.  Of  these,  132  subjects  with  schizophrenia  and  534  non-
schizophrenic subjects received 1 or more doses of ER OROS paliperidone. 
In the 17 studies that comprise the phase 1/2a studies in healthy adult subjects, 448 subjects received 1 
or  more  single  doses  of  study  medication,  including  275  subjects  who  received  ER  OROS 
paliperidone,  219  who  received  IR  or  other  (non-ER  OROS)  paliperidone  formulations,  62  who 
received placebo, and 52 who received risperidone. 
In the 3 studies that comprise the phase 1/2a studies in subjects with schizophrenia, study treatments 
included  up  to  2  weeks  of  daily  IR  paliperidone  (INT-1)  and  up  to  6  days  (SCH-101)  or  2  weeks 
(SCH-102) of treatment with ER OROS paliperidone high doses or risperidone. A total of 200 subjects 
participated  in  these  studies,  including  111  who  received  high  doses  of  ER  OROS  paliperidone,  34 
who received IR paliperidone, and 55 who received risperidone.  
The  other  8  phase  1/2a  studies  (P01-1004,  P01-1005,  REI-1001, SCH-1008, SCH-1009, SCH-1010, 
PALIOROS-SCH-1011,  and  PALIOROS-P01-1012)  included  474  subjects,  183  of  whom  had  a 
diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. In these 8 studies, 372 subjects, including 93 
with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, received 1 or more doses of a paliperidone formulation 
(IR or ER OROS).

•  Adverse events  
Adverse events in Phase 3 pivotal Double-Blind studies pooled data (SCH-303, SCH-304 and SCH-
305) 
In  these  studies  adult  patients  with  schizophrenia  were  treated  with  daily  doses  of  ER  OROS 
paliperidone ranging from 3 mg to 15 mg (6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose trials 
in adult subjects). Adverse events occurred in a higher percentage of subjects administered ER OROS 
paliperidone (72%) versus placebo (66%) or versus the olanzapine 10 mg/day group (69%). Table 20 
lists those adverse events that were reported with an incidence of ≥5% in any treatment group for the 
Pooled Double-blind Safety Analysis Set. 
The most frequent ADRs (≥2% of subjects receiving ER OROS paliperidone) were headache (13.2%), 
tachycardia  (6.6%),  akathisia  (6.5%),  sinus  tachycardia  (5.5%),  extrapyramidal  disorder  (5.4%), 
somnolence  (4.9%),  dizziness  (4.8%),  sedation  (4.2%),  tremor  (3.4%),  hypertonia  (2.8%),  dystonia 
(2.6%), orthostatic hypotension (2.5%), and dry mouth (2.4%). 
Those  ADRs  which  appeared  to  be  dose-related  included  weight  increased,  headache,  salivary 
hypersecretion,  vomiting,  dyskinesia,  akathisia,  dystonia,  extrapyramidal  disorder,  hypertonia,  and 
Parkinsonism.  The  only  clinically  relevant  difference  in  reporting  rates  for  common  adverse  events 
between  the  ER  OROS  paliperidone  and  olanzapine  groups  was  for  somnolence,  which  was  more 
frequent with olanzapine. 
The following represent all ADRs that were reported in the Invega-treated subjects in clinical trials. 
Very common (≥10%): headache;  
Common  (≥1%  to  <10%):  abdominal  pain  upper,  akathisia,  asthenia,  atrioventricular  block  first 
degree,  bradycardia,  bundle  branch  block,  dizziness,  dry  mouth,  dystonia,  extrapyramidal  disorder, 
fatigue,  hypertonia,  orthostatic  hypotension,  Parkinsonism,  salivary  hypersecretion,  sedation,  sinus 
tachycardia, somnolence, tachycardia, tremor, vomiting, and weight increased. 
Uncommon (≥0.1% to <1%): amenorrhea, anaphylactic reaction, breast discharge, dizziness postural, 
dyskinesia,  edema,  electrocardiogram  abnormal,  erectile  dysfunction,  galactorrhea,  gynecomastia, 
grand  mal  convulsion,  hypotension,  increased  appetite,  ischemia,  menstruation  irregular,  muscle 
rigidity, nightmare, oculogyration, palpitations, sinus arrhythmia and syncope; 
Rare (≥0.01% to <0.1%) or Very rare (<0.01%): none.

In addition, in accordance with the CHMP request, a complete list of ADRs (coded using MedDRA 
terminology)  reported  with  risperidone  and  not  yet  reported  with  paliperidone  has  been  added  to 
Section 4.8 of the SPC. 
Adverse events in Double-Blind Study in elderly subjects (SCH-302) 
Among elderly subjects with schizophrenia in Study SCH-302 (6-week, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, flexible-dose study), treatment-emergent adverse events occurred at similar rates in 
the  ER  OROS  paliperidone  (67%)  and  placebo  (71%)  groups.  Common  adverse  events  that 
were more frequently (≥4% between-group difference in incidence) reported in subjects who 
received  ER  OROS  paliperidone  versus  placebo  were  somnolence  (9%  vs  5%  placebo), 
dizziness  (7%  vs  0  placebo),  hypotension  (5%  vs  0  placebo),  sinus  tachycardia  (add  %), 
tachycardia (16% vs 0 placebo), and electrocardiogram QT corrected interval prolonged (7% 
vs 3% placebo). In the paliperidone group, ADRs judged to be severe included 1 case each of 
hypertonia,  acute  coronary  syndrome,  mania,  hypotension,  and  ECG  QT  corrected  interval 
prolonged.  Of  patients  who  experienced  QT-prolongation,  almost  all  had  a  prior  history  of 
cardiovascular  disorders  and/or  cardiovascular  adverse  events  or  QTc  prolongation  reported 
before initiation of treatment. 
Overall,  the  types  and  frequencies  of  ADRs  reported  in  the  elderly  subjects  (64  to  81  years)  in  this 
study were similar to those reported in the younger population of adult subjects with schizophrenia in 
Studies  SCH-303,  SCH-304,  and  SCH-305.  However,  based  on  the  limited  data  and consistent with 
general  clinical  practice,  a  greater  sensitivity  of  older  individuals  to  ADRs  cannot  be  ruled  out,  and 
this  is  reflected  in  the  SPC.  Of  note  are  the  cases  of  QT  interval  prolonged.  Overall,  cardiac  events 
(including  tachycardia)  associated  with  paliperidone  were  observed  in  a  higher  frequency  in  this 
patient group compared with non-elderly. 
Adverse events in Double-Blind recurrence Study (SCH-301) 
Due to the design of this study (long-term, recurrence/relapse prevention study in adult subjects), only 
adverse events that newly appeared or worsened in severity after initiation of double-blind medication 
were considered treatment-emergent in the double-blind phase. The results of this study suggest that 
subjects who continue to receive ER OROS paliperidone following a period of stabilization may have 
a lower incidence of new treatment-emergent adverse events after the period of stabilization compared 
with  those  for  whom  treatment  is  newly  initiated.  TEAEs  were  reported  at  similar  rates  during  the 
double-blind period for the ER OROS paliperidone (35%) and placebo (40%) groups. Only 4 adverse 
events occurred in at least 5% of subjects in either treatment group during the double-blind period, all 
of which were more frequent in the placebo group (schizophrenia, 15% vs 7%; psychotic disorder, 8% 
vs 0%; aggression, 5% vs 0%; insomnia, 6% vs 5%). The majority of these events were likely related 
to  exacerbation  of  the  underlying  psychotic  disorder  after  switching  from  open-label  ER  OROS 
paliperidone  to  placebo  in  the  double-blind  phase.  There  was  no  evidence  of  acute  withdrawal 
symptoms  in  subjects  abruptly  withdrawn  from  ER  OROS  paliperidone  treatment  (i.e.,  switched  to 
placebo). 
Adverse events in Open-Label Extension Studies (pooled data)  
For the Pooled Open-label Safety Analysis Set, 1 or more adverse events were reported during open-
label treatment for 875 (75%) of the 1170 subjects treated with flexibly dosed, open-label ER OROS 
paliperidone (3-15 mg), including 67% of the 416 subjects who received open-label treatment for ≤6 
months  and  79%  of  the  754  subjects  who  received  open-label  treatment  for  >6  months  as  of  the 
clinical  cut-off  date  (1  November  2005).  This  small  increase  suggests  an  absence  of  direct 
proportionality  between  longer  exposure  and  increased  incidence  of  adverse  events.  Across  all 
subjects  who  received  open-label  ER  OROS  paliperidone,  the  most  common  adverse  events  were 
insomnia  (14%),  headache  (12%),  and  akathisia  (10%).  Most  of  the  common  adverse  events  were 
reported  at  higher  rates  among  subjects  who  received  open-label  ER  OROS  paliperidone  for  >6 
months compared to those who received treatment for ≤6 months; adverse events reported at a lower 
rate in subjects treated for >6 months included psychotic disorder (12% vs 6% for ≤6 vs >6 months, 
respectively) and schizophrenia (9% vs 5%). Since these events represent worsening of the underlying 
psychotic  disorder,  they  most  likely  led  to  earlier  treatment  discontinuation,  thereby  explaining  the 
shorter duration.

In  general,  there  were  no  noteworthy  differences  in  the  reporting  rates  for  most  of  the  common 
adverse  events  as  a  function  of  previous  double-blind  treatment  for  the  Pooled  Open-label  Safety 
Analysis  Set.  Exceptions  included  extrapyramidal  disorder,  dystonia,  and  sinus  tachycardia,  all  of 
which  were  reported  at  rates  during  the  open-label  treatment  period  at  least  2-fold  higher  among 
subjects who had previously received placebo compared with those who received prior treatment with 
ER  OROS  paliperidone.  Rates  for  these  3  adverse  events  in  the  placebo/paliperidone  group  were 
generally  consistent  with  those  observed  with  ER  OROS  paliperidone  for  the  Pooled  Double-blind 
Safety Analysis Set. Most adverse event reports of EPS-related events, somnolence, and tachycardia 
occurred during the first 4 weeks of treatment with ER OROS paliperidone in the extension studies; 
incidence rates for these adverse events were lower at later time points. 
Overall no particular safety issue was noted with long-term compared with short-term treatment. 
Specific safety issues 
Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) 
A  higher  proportion  of  subjects  who  received  9,  12,  and  15  mg  of  ER  OROS  paliperidone  versus 
placebo or lower ER OROS paliperidone doses (3 or 6 mg) experienced EPS-related adverse events 
categorized  as  dystonia,  dyskinesia,  Parkinsonism,  and  hyperkinesias  in  the  Pooled  Double-blind 
Safety Analysis Set (table 21). 
EPS-related  adverse  events  were  reported  for  33%  of  subjects  receiving  open-label  ER  OROS 
paliperidone  during  the  run-in/stabilization  phase  of  Study  SCH-301;  among  these,  3  subjects 
experienced  EPS-related  adverse  events  (dyskinesia,  akathisia,  tremor)  that  resulted  in  the 
discontinuation of open-label ER OROS paliperidone. No subjects had a serious EPS-related adverse 
event  or  withdrew  for  these  events  during  the  double-blind  phase  of  Study  SCH-301.  Dosing  was 
initiated at 9 mg in Study SCH-301, and the higher rate of EPS-related adverse events during the run-
in/stabilization phase is consistent with the higher rates of these events seen with doses of 9 mg to 15 
mg in the Pooled Double-blind Safety Analysis Set (24%-26%), where 2 EPS-related adverse events 
were serious among ER OROS paliperidone-treated subjects (akathisia and dystonia), and ER OROS 
paliperidone treatment was discontinued due to an EPS-related adverse event in 0.6% of subjects.

There  was  no  indication  that  EPS-related  adverse  events  occurred  more  often  in  elderly  subjects 
receiving ER OROS paliperidone compared with placebo in Study SCH-302. 
In  the  Pooled  Open-label  Safety  Analysis  Set,  the  EPS-profile  (incidence  of  EPS-related  adverse 
events: 24%) was almost identical to the one seen in the Pooled Double-blind Safety Analysis Set for 
doses  of  9  mg  or  higher,  and  in  this  Analysis  Set,  1%  of  subjects  were  withdrawn  for  EPS-related 
adverse events, while 3 reports of akathisia and 2 reports of dystonia were considered serious. 
Among subjects treated in Study SCH-701, no EPS-related adverse event was serious; 1 subject was 
discontinued  for  tremor  and  dyskinesia  within  6  months  of  switching  from  double-blind  placebo  to 
paliperidone. 
Across all of the Phase 3 studies (completed and ongoing), 2 subjects were reported to have tardive 
dyskinesia. Oculogyration was reported in 5 (<1%) subjects receiving ER OROS paliperidone in the 
completed  Phase  3  double-blind  studies,  for  3  (0.3%)  subjects  receiving  open-label  ER  OROS 
paliperidone  treatment,  and  for  2  subjects  treated  with  ER  OROS  paliperidone  in  Study  R076477-
SCH-1010. None of these reported events were serious or resulted in treatment discontinuation. 
In conclusion, extrapyramidal symptoms were dose-related and occurred predominantly with doses of 
9 mg/day or more, and this information is reflected in the SPC. 
Suicidality  
As  of  28  February  2006,  there  were  a  total  of  4  reports  (3  in  subjects  receiving  ER  OROS 
paliperidone) of completed suicide among subjects participating in the completed Phase 1/2a studies 
or completed or ongoing Phase 3 clinical studies. These include 1 report of a completed suicide the 
day following discontinuation of open-label ER OROS paliperidone in a subject participating in Study 
SCH-301,  2  reports  of  completed  suicide  in  subjects  receiving  open-label  ER  OROS  paliperidone 
during extension Study SCH-703, and 1 report of a completed suicide in a placebo-treated subject in 
Study SCH-301. 
In the Pooled Double-blind Safety Analysis Set, the percentage of adult subjects with schizophrenia 
who reported a suicidality adverse event (suicidal ideation or attempt) are similar for the ER OROS 
paliperidone  (n=10,  1%),  placebo  (n=5,  1%),  and  olanzapine  (n=5,  1%)  groups.  An  estimate  of  the 
incidence of these events based on subject-exposure years indicated that the risk of suicidality adverse 
events was greater for placebo-treated subjects than for subjects treated with ER OROS paliperidone. 
The  rates  of  suicidal  ideation  and  suicide  attempts  per  subject-years  of  exposure  were  14.5 and 3.6, 
respectively,  for  the  placebo  group  compared  with  10.3  and  1.1,  respectively,  for  the  pooled  ER 
OROS paliperidone group. 
No elderly subject in Study SCH-302 had a suicide-related event. 
In Study SCH-301, adverse events related to suicide were reported for 5 (1%) subjects during the run-
in/stabilization phase on open-label ER OROS paliperidone, and for 5 subjects during the double-blind 
phase (4 in the placebo group and 1 in the ER OROS paliperidone group). 
Adverse  events  related  to  suicidality  were  reported  for  26  (2%)  subjects  in  the  Pooled  Open-label 
Safety Analysis Set, were more frequent in those treated for ≤6 months than for those treated for >6 
months, and most involved suicidal ideation. 
In conclusion, there is no signal of an increased risk of suicidality based on the data presented. 
Somnolence  
In  the  Pooled  Double-blind  Safety  Analysis  Set,  the  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  somnolence, 
sedation, lethargy, or hypersomnia was similar among subjects receiving ER OROS paliperidone (9%) 
compared with placebo (7%). The rate of these events was similar at ER OROS paliperidone doses of 
6  to  15  mg  (9  to  11%),  and  was  lower  (6%)  for  the  3  mg  dose  group.  Somnolence-related  adverse 
events were reported for 19% of subjects treated with olanzapine in these studies. 
In  Study  SCH-301,  the  frequency  of  somnolence-related  adverse  events  was  6%  for  the  run-
in/stabilization  phase  and  2%  for  the  double-blind phase (vs 0% for placebo). In Study SCH-302 in 
elderly subjects, the rate of somnolence-related adverse events for ER OROS paliperidone (9%) was 
similar to that observed in the double-blind studies in generally younger subjects, but higher than the 
rate of these events observed for elderly subjects treated with placebo (5%). A life table analysis for 
the  Pooled  Double-blind  Safety  Analysis  Set  indicated  that  most  reports  of  somnolence-related 
adverse events occurred during the first week of treatment, regardless of treatment group. 
For the Pooled Open-label Safety Analysis Set, somnolence-related adverse events were reported for 
8%  of  subjects,  and  most  occurred  in  the  first  month  of  treatment  with  open-label  ER  OROS 
paliperidone.  
45/58 
©EMEA 2007 
 
 
Across all completed double-blind studies, none of the reports of somnolence-related adverse events 
were serious, and 4 subjects discontinued ER OROS paliperidone as a result of this type of adverse 
event.  For  the  open-label  extension  studies,  2  reports  of  somnolence-related  adverse  events  were 
serious, and 2 resulted in discontinuation. 
In conclusion, somnolence is an expected ADR, but appears to be less common than for the reference 
compound. Elderly subjects may be at higher risk, as was the case in Study SCH-302. 
Effects on Serum Prolactin Levels   
Median increases in prolactin levels from baseline were observed for adult subjects with schizophrenia 
of  both  sexes  receiving  ER  OROS  paliperidone,  with  median  increases  at  end  point  larger  among 
female subjects (81.14 ng/mL) than among male subjects (23.75 ng/mL) for the Pooled Double-blind 
Safety  Analysis  Set  (all  dose  levels  combined).  There  appeared  to  be  a  dose-relationship.  The 
incidence of subjects of both sexes with treatment-emergent elevations in prolactin levels was higher 
in  the  ER  OROS  paliperidone  group  (70%  and  62%  for  males  and  females,  respectively)  versus 
placebo (13% and 12% for males and females, respectively) or olanzapine (20% and 32% for males 
and  females,  respectively).  Although  a  median  increase  in  prolactin  levels  was  also  seen  among 
elderly subjects and was more pronounced in female subjects, none of the elderly subjects experienced 
a potentially prolactin-related adverse event.  
No  noteworthy  differences  between  paliperidone  and  IR  risperidone  were  observed    in  3  Phase  1 
studies with regard to their effect on prolactin levels. 
Across all the studies, the proportion of subjects who experienced potentially prolactin-related adverse 
events (amenorrhoea, gynaecomastia and galactorrhoea) remained below 4% for all dose groups (3mg, 
6mg, 9mg and 12mg). None of these events was considered serious, and only one (anorgasmia) was 
rated as severe by the investigator. 
Metabolic-Related Effects  
GLUCOSE-RELATED ADVERSE EVENTS  
In  the  Pooled  Double-blind  Safety  Analysis  Set,  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  glucose-related 
adverse  events  was  comparable  for  the  placebo  (1%),  ER  OROS  paliperidone  (1%),  and  olanzapine 
(1%)  groups.  There  was  no  indication  of  a  dose-related  trend  in  the  occurrence  of  glucose-related 
adverse  events  with  ER  OROS  paliperidone.  The  most  common  of  these  events  was  blood  glucose 
increased,  reported  for  4  subjects  receiving  ER  OROS  paliperidone  and  1  subject  each  receiving 
placebo or olanzapine. Glucose-related adverse events were considered serious for 2 subjects. Blood 
glucose  increased  occurred  in  a  subject  with  no  history  of  diabetes  mellitus  treated  with  ER  OROS 
paliperidone 15 mg; this subject was withdrawn as a result of this adverse event, which resolved after 
discontinuation.  In  the  second  subject,  who  had  a  history  of  diabetes,  hypoglycemia  and  diabetes 
mellitus  were  reported  during  treatment  with  ER  OROS  paliperidone  9  mg  and  were  considered 
serious, but were not treatment limiting. 
None  of  the  elderly  subjects  with  schizophrenia  in  Study  SCH-302  had  a  glucose-related  adverse 
event. 
CHANGES IN SERUM GLUCOSE LEVELS 
Mean  changes  from  baseline  to  end  point  in  serum  glucose  associated  with  ER  OROS  paliperidone 
treatment in all Phase 3 safety analysis sets were similar to that observed with placebo in the Pooled 
Double-blind  Safety  Analysis  Set.  Across  the  5  completed  double-blind  studies,  markedly  abnormal 
elevations in serum glucose were reported for 4 subjects receiving ER OROS paliperidone, including 3 
subjects  who  had  such  abnormalities  in  the  run-in/stabilization  phase  of  Study  SCH-301  and  for  3 
subjects  treated  with  open-label  ER  OROS  paliperidone  in  the  extension  studies.  Of  the  7  subjects 
with markedly abnormal glucose levels (high or low) while receiving double-blind or open-label ER 
OROS  paliperidone,  3  had  adverse  events  associated  with  the  markedly  low  (1  in  a  subject  with  a 
history of diabetes mellitus) or markedly high (2 subjects) glucose levels. 
In conclusion, in these datasets, the frequency of glucose related ADRs were similar to placebo and 
appeared not to be dose-related.

CHANGES IN SERUM LIPID LEVELS 
Mean changes in serum levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, or triglycerides 
were small and not clinically noteworthy in the completed and ongoing Phase 3 studies. 
CHANGES IN BODY WEIGHT AND BODY MASS INDEX 
In the Pooled Double-blind Safety Analysis Set, the mean body weight and BMI increases in the ER 
OROS paliperidone 15 mg group (1.9 kg and 0.6 kg/m2) were similar to those in the olanzapine group 
(2.0  kg  and  0.7  kg/m2),  whereas  the  mean  changes  in  the  ER  OROS  paliperidone  3  mg  to  12  mg 
groups (0.6 to 1.1 kg and 0.2 to 0.4 kg/m2) were approximately half those seen in these other 2 groups. 
Similarly,  weight  increases  from  baseline  of  ≥7%  were  more  common  among  subjects  in  the 
olanzapine and ER OROS paliperidone 15 mg groups (18% for each) compared to the placebo group 
(5%) or ER OROS paliperidone 3 to 12 mg dose groups (6 to 9%).  
No noteworthy mean changes in body weight or BMI were seen among elderly subjects treated with a 
median modal dose of 9 mg/day (Study SCH-302). 
Adverse  events  of  weight  increase  were  infrequent  during  the  open-label  extension  studies  with  ER 
OROS paliperidone (3% and 5% for those treated for ≤6 or >6 months, respectively). None of these 
events  were  reported  as  serious;  2  subjects  discontinued  open-label  ER  OROS  paliperidone  due  to 
weight increase, while 1 subject was withdrawn for an adverse event of weight decrease. 
Overall,  paliperidone  is  associated  with  an  increase  in  BMI  in  an  apparent  dose-dependent  manner, 
and  this  is  reflected  in  the  SPC.  However,  paliperidone  appears  not  to  be  associated  with  lipid 
changes. The effect appears to be lower than for olanzapine, which is expected for a drug similar to 
risperidone. 
Cardiovascular Effects  
ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION 
In the Phase 3 studies, orthostatic hypotension was not reported as serious or treatment limiting in any 
subject  treated  with  ER  OROS  paliperidone.  In  the  Pooled  Double-blind  Safety  Analysis  Set,  the 
incidence of orthostatic hypotension as an adverse event was comparable for ER OROS paliperidone 
doses of 3 mg (2%), 6 mg (1%) and 9 mg (2%) to that for placebo (1%), while higher reporting rates 
were  seen  for  doses  of  12  mg  (4%)  or 15 mg (3%). In Study SCH-301, the incidence of orthostatic 
hypotension  as  an  adverse  event  was  1%  during  the  run-in  and  stabilization  phases;  each  of  these 
events  was  mild  and  occurred  early,  between  Days  1  and  25.  Among  the  elderly  subjects  with 
schizophrenia in Study SCH-302, there were no reports of adverse events of orthostatic hypotension 
with ER OROS paliperidone (flexible dose range of 3 to 12 mg) or placebo.  
Overall,  paliperidone  causes  dose-dependent  orthostatic  hypotension  as  expected  and  in  the  SPC 
caution is recommended when INVEGA is to be administered in patients with known cardiovascular 
disease, cerebrovascular disease, or conditions that predispose the patient to hypotension. 
QT 
A  thorough  QT  study  (Study  SCH-1009)  was  performed:  it  was  a  double-blind,  active-controlled, 
multicenter  trial  that  evaluated  the  effects  of  IR  paliperidone  (8  mg/day  dose,  which  generated 
supratherapeutic  plasma  levels  on  the  QT  interval)  in  141  adults  with  schizophrenia  and 
schizoaffective  disorder.  As  required  by  the  ICH  E14  Guideline,  the  peak  plasma  concentration 
achieved in this study at steady-state with 8 mg IR paliperidone (113 ng/mL) was more than twice as 
high as that achieved by the highest dose of ER OROS paliperidone to be marketed (12 mg: 45 ng/mL; 
data  from  PAL-SCH-101).  The  primary  ECG  variable  was  the  difference  in  day-averaged  QTcLD 
between IR paliperidone 8 mg at steady state (Day 8) and placebo (Day 1). Moxifloxacin was included 
in the study as a positive control to evaluate assay sensitivity for the primary variable.  
The 8 mg dose of IR paliperidone was associated with a small, albeit statistically significant, LS mean 
increase  in  the  model-adjusted,  day-averaged  QTcLD  of  5.5  msec  (90%  CI:  3.66,  7.25)  relative  to 
placebo (Day 1). Moxifloxacin 400 mg (Day 8) resulted in a LSM (SE) difference in QTcLD versus 
Day 1 (placebo) of 4.3 msec (90% CI: 2.88, 5.64). While the increase in the mean QTcLD interval in 
this study exceeded the 5 msec threshold for regulatory concern, it was less than a mean QTc interval 
increase  of  >20  msec  that  is  generally  accepted  as  the  level  of  change  that  signals  a  substantial 
increase in the risk of arrhythmias. In addition, since the upper limit of the 90% confidence interval 
(7.25 msec) was below the predefined limit of 10.0 msec as described in ICH E14, the mean effect of 
47/58 
©EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
IR paliperidone 8 mg at steady-state (Day 8) on QTcLD was considered not to exceed the threshold 
level  for  regulatory  concern.  However,  it  is  interesting  to  note  that  the  upper  limit  of  the  90% 
confidence interval exceeded the 10 msec value for the 1.5-hour observations on Days 2 and 4, and 
between  1  and  3  hours  on  Day  8  (≤13.62ms),  and  more  patients  in  the  paliperidone  group  (26%) 
compared with moxifloxacin (17%) had a QTc increase of 30-60 ms. 
Tmax  was  about  2  hours,  both  on  Day  2  (single  4-mg  dose)  and  on  Day  8  (steady-state  8-mg  dose). 
Further data explorations did not demonstrate a correlation between plasma concentration and effect 
on  the  mean  changes  from  baseline  QTcLD  values,  suggesting  that  the  effects  of  paliperidone  on 
QTcLD cannot be explained by plasma concentrations only. 
The elderly may be more sensitive, as was suggested in Study SCH-302, and discontinuation due to 
QT-prolongation among the elderly is of note. 
In accordance to what was agreed during the PhVWP May 2006 meeting, the SPC for paliperidone 
(as  recommended  for  all  neuroleptics)  include  appropriate  warnings  about  the  potential  to  prolong 
the QT and the potential for causing arrhythmias. 
Following the CHMP request, the Applicant presented additional data clarifying that there were no 
gender-based differences concerning QT prolongation.  
Study  R076477  SCH-1009  was  performed  administering  IR  paliperidone  formulation.  However,  the 
CHMP objected that the use of the modified-release paliperidone would have been more appropriate, 
since  the  effect  on  QTcLD  cannot  be  explained  by  plasma  concentrations  only  and  a  formulation 
influence  cannot  be  excluded.  The  Sponsor  performed  an  additional  thorough  QT  study  (Study 
R076477-SCH-1014)  to  confirm  and  extend  the  cardiovascular  safety  profile  of  paliperidone  ER  in 
subjects  with  schizophrenia  or  schizoaffective  disorder.  This  was  a  non-inferiority  study  comparing 
the effects on QTcLD of steady state paliperidone ER at 12 mg and the supratherapeutic dose of 18 
mg  with  steady  state  quetiapine  (a  marketed  antipsychotic  that  is  considered  to  have  an  acceptable 
cardiovascular  safety  profile)  at  400  mg  twice  daily.  The  observed  QTcLD  prolongation  was 
numerically  less  with  the  supratherapeutic  dose  of  18  mg  of  paliperidone  ER  than  with  quetiapine, 
and  overall,  these  data  further  confirmed  the  cardiovascular  safety  of  the  ER  formulation  of 
paliperidone at the maximum recommended dose of once daily 12 mg, and at a dose of once daily 18 
mg, which is 50% above this recommendation. No evidence of clinically relevant QTcLD prolongation 
with  paliperidone  ER  in  comparison  to  quetiapine  or  placebo  was  observed,  so  the  risk  of  QTcLD 
prolongation seems to be similar to paliperidone IR and risperidone.  
CHANGES IN RECORDED ECG PARAMETERS 
Beside observed increases in heart rate, the incidence of ECG parameters outside clinically important 
limits during the double-blind period was similar in the placebo and ER OROS paliperidone treatment 
groups  for  the  Pooled  Double-blind  Safety  Analysis  Set  and  for  double-blind  Studies  SCH-302  and 
SCH-301.  Compared  with  placebo  (23%),  a  higher  percentage  of  subjects  treated  with  ER  OROS 
paliperidone  (36%)  or  olanzapine  (31%)  had  high  heart  rate  values  (>=100  bpm).  This  finding  is 
consistent  with  pulse  rate  results.  Similarly,  high  heart  rate  values  were  more  common  for  the  ER 
OROS paliperidone group compared to the placebo group among elderly subjects with schizophrenia 
in Study SCH-302 (25% vs 5%) and during the double-blind phase of Study SCH-301 (7% vs 2%).  
The  lower  incidence  of  high  heart  rate  values  during  double-blind  treatment  with  ER  OROS 
paliperidone in Study SCH-301 relative to the other double-blind studies may suggest an attenuation 
of  this  effect  over  time;  32%  of  subjects  had  increases  in  heart  rate  during  open-label  ER  OROS 
paliperidone treatment during the run-in/stabilization phase of Study SCH-301. 
Multiple ECGs were recorded during the open-label extension studies, and the incidence of an 
elevation in heart rate to >= 100 bpm was 23%. 
Overall, paliperidone causes an increase of heart rate as expected, similar to risperidone. 
CHANGES IN CORRECTED QT INTERVALS 
In  the  Pooled  Double-blind  Safety  Analysis  Set,  LS  mean  differences  in  QTcLD  from  placebo 
treatment  were  <  4  ms  with  all  doses  of  ER  OROS  paliperidone.  None  of  the  adult  subjects  with 
schizophrenia receiving ER OROS paliperidone or placebo in these studies had a QTcLD of 480 msec 
48/58 
©EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
or  higher  at  any  time  during  double-blind  treatment,  although  a  QTcLD  value  of  >480  msec  (508 
msec) was recorded for one subject  (67-year-old woman) on the day following study completion. This 
subject  entered  the  open-label  extension  and  the  QTcLD  did  not  worsen.  She  did  not  experience  a 
cardiovascular adverse event and no abnormal vital sign values were recorded. One subject receiving 
olanzapine  had  a  QTcLD  value  of  ≥480  msec  (531  msec)  during  double-blind  treatment  and  was 
hospitalized  for  QTc  interval  prolongation  and  hypokalemia;  the  average  predose  QTcLD  value  for 
this subject was normal (421 msec) and he was withdrawn from study treatment. 
The incidence of increases in QTcLD of 30-60 msec was comparable for the placebo and ER OROS 
paliperidone 3 to 12 mg groups (9% and 5-8%, respectively) but was higher for the 15 mg dose group 
(12%).  One  subject  each  in  the  ER  OROS  paliperidone  12  mg  and  olanzapine  groups  had  a  change 
exceeding 60 msec at one time-point (changes of 62 and 110 msec, respectively).  
Similar  results  were  observed  in  Study  SCH-302  among  elderly  subjects  with  schizophrenia  and  in 
Study SCH-301 among adult subjects with schizophrenia.  
Overall, the frequency of QT-prolongation was higher in the 15 mg groups in the double-blind trials. 
Discontinuation  due  to  QT-prolongation among the elderly is of note. It should be remembered that 
patients with significant cardiovascular disease were excluded.  
ADVERSE EVENTS SUGGESTIVE OF PROARRHYTHMIC POTENTIAL 
No safety signal of a proarrhythmic potential emerged from the data provided.  
CHANGES IN BLOOD PRESSURE AND HEART RATE 
There  were  no  clinically  relevant  differences  between  ER  OROS  paliperidone  groups  and  placebo 
group  with  regard  to  mean  changes  from  baseline  in  standing  or  supine  systolic  and  diastolic  blood 
pressure in the Pooled Double-blind Safety Analysis Set, for Study SCH-302, or for Study SCH-301. 
Results  from  the  completed  double-blind  studies  and  open-label  extensions  of  double-blind  studies 
were consistent in showing that ER OROS paliperidone treatment is associated with increased pulse 
rate.  The  percentages  of  subjects  with  standing  or  supine  pulse  rates  of  >100  bpm  with  an  increase 
from  baseline  of  ≥15  bpm  were  higher  in  the  pooled  ER  OROS  paliperidone  dose  group  (31%  and 
17%, respectively) than with placebo (22% and 10%, respectively) for the Pooled Double-blind Safety 
Analysis Set. The highest incidence of elevated pulse rate was observed in the 15 mg dose group (39% 
and  22%),  and  there  was  no  consistent  relationship  between  ER  OROS  paliperidone  dose  and  the 
occurrence of elevated pulse rates among subjects who received lower doses. The percentages of ER 
OROS paliperidone-treated subjects with adverse events of tachycardia and sinus tachycardia (6% for 
each) were lower than the percentages with abnormally high pulse rates. Few reports of tachycardia (2 
of  58  cases)  and  sinus  tachycardia  (2  of  55  cases)  in  ER  OROS  paliperidone-treated  subjects  were 
assessed  as  severe  in  severity  and  only  5  cases  in  total  were  reported  as  serious  or  were  treatment 
limiting.  
While  more  elderly  subjects  with  schizophrenia  receiving  ER  OROS  paliperidone  compared  with 
placebo had elevated standing or supine pulse rates of >100 bpm with an increase of ≥15 bpm in Study 
SCH-302, the rates (12% and 7%, respectively) were less than that observed in the other double-blind 
Phase  3  studies.  Among  the  elderly  population  studied  in  Study  SCH-302,  there  was  a  closer 
correspondence  between  reported  rates  for  sinus  tachycardia  (9%)  and  tachycardia  (7%)  in  the  ER 
OROS paliperidone group and the observed percentages of subjects with abnormal elevations in pulse 
rate. No elderly subject was withdrawn from ER OROS paliperidone therapy due to sinus tachycardia 
or tachycardia, and none of these reported adverse events were considered serious. 
Results for Study SCH-301 were consistent with those reported for the other double-blind studies.  
In  conclusion,  in  similarity  with  risperidone  paliperidone  causes  a  dose-dependent  increase  of  heart 
rate, which is expected.

instability, altered consciousness, and elevated serum creatine phosphokinase levels has been reported 
to  occur  with  antipsychotics,  including  paliperidone.  Therefore,  special  warnings  concerning  NMS

OVERDOSE 
Experience from overdose is very limited. Three cases were reported during the 5 phase 3 studies and 
their open-label extension studies, all of which recovered within 5 days (with no treatment in the first 
case,  and  after  treatment  with  ziprasidone  or  with  infusions  of  Ringers,  saline,  levulose  and 
furosemide  in the second and third case respectively). Exhaustive information regarding overdose is

The placebo-controlled, fixed dose design of Phase 3 Studies SCH-303, SCH-304, and SCH-305 allow 
examination of dose relationships for ER OROS paliperidone with respect to safety-related findings. 
While  a  dose  relationship  was  not  observed  for  the  rates  of  treatment  limiting  or  serious  adverse 
events,  certain  safety-related  findings  were  more  common  with  the  highest  doses  of  ER  OROS 
paliperidone tested, namely 12 and 15 mg:

•  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Serious adverse events  
In the Pooled Double-blind Safety Analysis Set, the percentage of subjects with serious adverse events 
was the same for the ER OROS paliperidone (n=55, 6%), placebo (n=23, 6%), and olanzapine groups 
(n=22, 6%). Psychotic disorder and schizophrenia were the adverse events most commonly reported as 
serious, and most of these events, as well as other serious psychiatric disorders, occurred in subjects 
hospitalized due to exacerbation of psychotic symptoms. Serious adverse events other than psychiatric 
disorders  were  uncommon  (incidence  <1%  in  total  ER  OROS  paliperidone  group)  and  showed  no 
apparent  differences  in  incidence  between  the  treatment  groups.  There  was  no  apparent  dose 
relationship  in  the  incidence  of  any  serious  adverse  event  among  subjects  who  received  ER  OROS 
paliperidone. 
In Study SCH-302, a higher proportion of elderly subjects treated with placebo (n=3, 8%) experienced 
adverse events considered serious compared with those receiving ER OROS paliperidone (n=2, 3%).   
During  the  run-in/stabilization  phase  of  Study  SCH-301,  30  (6%)  subjects  receiving  open-label  ER 
OROS paliperidone experienced a serious adverse event, and the rate of serious adverse events during 
the double-blind phase was higher for the placebo group (16%) than for the ER OROS paliperidone 
group  (8%).  As  in  the  other  studies,  most  of  the  serious  adverse  events  in  SCH-301  represented 
exacerbations of psychiatric conditions. 
Up to 1 November 2005, adverse events were reported as serious for 172 (15%) subjects who received 
open-label ER OROS paliperidone in the Pooled Open-label Safety Analysis Set. Consistent with the 
observations  for  the  completed  double-blind  studies,  hospitalizations  for  psychotic  disorder  (5%),

schizophrenia (4%), and agitation (1.2%) were the only serious events reported for >1.0% of the 1170 
subjects in this analysis set.  
6 (3%) subjects in the Study SCH-701 Safety Analysis Set had a serious adverse event while receiving 
open-label  ER  OROS  paliperidone,  including  5  who  had  previously  received  double-blind  placebo 
(schizophrenia,  paranoia,  suicide  attempt,  tibia  fracture,  syncope)  and  1  previously  treated  with  ER 
OROS paliperidone (schizophrenia).  
Between  2  November  2005  and  28  February  2006,  serious  adverse  events  were  reported  for  21 
subjects in the ongoing open-label extension studies, 1 of which was a death from unknown causes, 1 
was a suicide attempt, 1 was an overdose, 1 was a hospitalization for seizure events, and the remainder 
mainly involved hospitalizations for exacerbations of psychotic symptoms/condition. 
Overall,  there  was  no  indication  of  an  increased  frequency  of  SAE  for  paliperidone  compared  with 
placebo.  
Deaths  
Across  all  completed and ongoing clinical studies with ER OROS paliperidone, a total of 10 deaths 
have been reported as of 28 February 2006, including 5 deaths among subjects treated with ER OROS 
paliperidone,  4  among  those  receiving  placebo,  and  1  in  an  olanzapine-treated  subject.  The  overall 
fatality rate in the clinical studies with ER OROS paliperidone is not different from that for placebo or 
olanzapine  in  these  studies.  One  death  was  reported  among  the  subjects  receiving  paliperidone  in 
completed  clinical  studies:  a  36-year-old  male  receiving  ER  OROS  paliperidone  in  Study  SCH-301 
committed suicide. As of 28 February 2006, 4 deaths were reported among subjects treated with ER 
OROS paliperidone in the ongoing extension studies: 2 fatalities were the result of completed suicides 
(both  in  Study  SCH-703),  one  was  due  to  bronchopneumonia  (SCH-702),  and  for  one  information 
concerning the cause of death is not known (Study SCH-701). The 4 deaths reported among placebo-
treated subjects were the result of coma, cardiac arrest, completed suicide, and gun shot wound, and 
the death in the olanzapine-treated subject was due to cardio-pulmonary arrest. 
Overall, there is no signal of an increased risk of death from any cause based on the data presented.

•  Laboratory findings 
The overall clinical laboratory test results in the completed and ongoing Phase 3 studies included in 
this submission did not suggest any safety concerns associated with the use of paliperidone ER OROS 
in  the  treatment  of  schizophrenia.  Overall,  changes  in  laboratory  test  values  for  individual  subjects 
other than prolactin were transient, of limited severity, and not considered clinically relevant.

•  Safety in special populations 
Pregnancy and lactation 
The safety of paliperidone for use in women who are pregnant or lactating has not been established. 
All  clinical  studies  specifically  excluded  women  who  were  pregnant  or  lactating,  and  women  who 
became  pregnant  were  to  be  discontinued  from  the  study.  No  pregnancies  occurred  during  the  ER 
OROS paliperidone clinical trials. Based on the available data, ER OROS paliperidone should only be 
used in pregnancy if the benefits outweigh the risks or unless clearly necessary, and it should not be 
used while breast feeding. This is reflected in the SPC (section 4.6). 
Children and adolescents 
The  safety  and  effectiveness  of  ER  OROS  paliperidone  in  patients  <18  years  of  age  have  not  been 
studied, and this is reflected in the SPC. 
Age, gender, race 
There were no noteworthy differences in adverse events reported with respect to gender, age, or racial 
group for the Pooled Double-blind Safety Analysis Set. In the SPC no dose adjustment for INVEGA is 
recommended based on gender, race or smoking status.  
Immunological events 
Immunological  events  were  not  commented  by  the  MAH,  but  paliperidone  is  not  expected  to  be 
associated with immunological events. 
Elderly  
The  safety  profile  of  paliperidone  is  similar  for  elderly  and  non-elderly  subjects.  However,  elderly 
patients are more likely to have decreased creatinine clearance compared with younger patients. Based 
on the limited data available and consistent with general clinical practice, a greater sensitivity of older 
individuals to ADRs cannot be ruled out, and this is reflected in the SPC (section 4.8). Discontinuation 
of paliperidone treatment due to QT prolongation among elderly is of note. 
Elderly patients with dementia were excluded from clinical trials with paliperidone and thus this risk 
could not be assessed. Warnings and precautions regarding the use in elderly patients with dementia 
are included in section 4.4 of the SPC. 
•  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No safety issues in this respect can be identified from the submitted clinical data. However, as already 
mentioned, the SPC has included certain key elements regarding cardiotoxicity, in accordance with the 
“Pharmacovigilance Working Party Public Assessment Report on Neuroleptics and Cardiac safety, in 
particular QT prolongation, cardiac arrhythmias, ventricular tachycardia and torsades de pointes”.  
•  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In  the  Pooled  Double-blind  Safety  Analysis  Set,  the  proportion  of  subjects  that  reported  adverse 
events  leading  to  study  discontinuation  was  the  same  across  the  Invega  (5%),  placebo  (5%),  and 
olanzapine groups (5%). The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation were psychotic 
disorder  and  agitation,  and  their  incidence  events  showed  no  clinically  relevant  difference  between 
treatments.  Other  treatment-limiting  events  occurred  infrequently  and  showed  no  pattern  related  to 
treatment or to Invega dose. Discontinuation due to QT-prolongation among the elderly is of note. 
•  Post marketing experience 
Invega has not been marketed in any country at the time of the submission. There is no post marketing 
experience.  The  MAH  has  submitted  a  risk  management  plan  and  a  pharmacovigilance  plan,  apart 
from routine pharmacovigilance practices, is not deemed necessary. The pharmacovigilance system as 
described by the applicant is considered acceptable.

1.1  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  Applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements. 
In  the  data  submitted  the  Applicant  has  provided  information  which  ensures  that  the  necessary 
resources and systems are in place to support routine pharmacovigilance activities that meet the needs 
for this product. 
Risk Management Plan 
The MAA submitted a risk management plan. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was 
of the opinion that  
• 
and 
•  no  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  were  required  beyond  those  included  in  the  product 
routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product 
information. 
The Applicant has provided a good and thorough discussion about potential risks.  
Following  request  by  the  CHMP,  the  MAH  submitted  a  document  detailing  the  assessment  of  the 
development of breast cancer, which was not originally included in the application. 
It  has  been  demonstrated  by  the  applicant  that  the  drilling  process  is  acceptably  controlled  by  the 
‘automated  current  draw  verification  system’.  However,  in-process  controls  conducted  during  the 
manufacturing process allow a relatively high percentage of tablets which do not have an orifice.  
The CHMP envisaged the possibility to address the safety/efficacy implications of this quality issue in 
the RMP. As a response, the Applicant proposed to include in the INVEGA Risk Management Plan the 
warning of a potential risk for patients to be exposed to paliperidone ER tablets without an orifice and 
a detailed description of the risk assessment performed. According to the Applicant, the potential risk 
of  such  an  exposure  can  be  managed  with  quality  controls  during  the  manufacturing  process, 
postmarketing  surveillance  for  product  quality  reports  of  “no  orifice”  tablets,  and  monitoring  of 
postmarketing reports of lack of efficacy (e.g. Periodic Safety Update Reports, and no additional risk 
management activities are required to minimize this risk. The CHMP accepted the Sponsor proposal; 
as a result, the inclusion of the proposed statement in the RMP was regarded sufficient, and no further 
activities were deemed necessary. 
Based  on  the  identified  risks,  potential  risks,  and  pharmacological  class  effects,  and  the  vast 
postmarketing  experience  with  risperidone,  routine  pharmacovigilance  is  considered  sufficient  for 
post-authorisation safety monitoring. Overall, no specific pharmacovigilance plan or risk minimisation 
steps apart from routine pharmacovigilance practices are considered indicated. 
Routine pharmacovigilance would include: AE collection and single case processing, drafting and 
review  of  aggregate  reports  (Health  Authority  Specific  Reports  including  ad  hoc  reports  requested 
from  Health  Authorities,  Periodic  Safety  Update  Reports,  Annual  Safety  Reports),  and  surveillance 
and signal detection (both intra-product and inter-product signaling utilising using various databases 
such  as  SCEPTRE,  FDA/AERS  Database,  WHO  Vigibase  Database,  review  of  lot-related  adverse 
events or product quality/technical complaints).

Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Quality 
The quality of the product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. There are 
no unresolved quality issues, which have a negative impact on the Benefit Risk balance of the product. 
to  exaggerated  pharmacology, particularly  due 
toxicity  studies  with  paliperidone  and  risperidone  were  carried  out.  In 
Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology 
Non-clinical  pharmacology  and  toxicology  were  sufficiently  documented  in  the  non  clinical  studies 
program  for  paliperidone.  Since  paliperidone  is  the  major  metabolite  of  risperidone,  comparative 
line 
repeat-dose 
with given scientific advice, no 12-month repeat-dose toxicity study in dogs or carcinogenicity studies 
in rats and mice were performed with paliperidone. These studies were bridged to studies previously 
conducted with risperidone in support of the marketing application for Risperdal®.

Toxicity  findings  related 
antagonism, were numerous and included treatment-related sedation and (palpebral) ptosis, enhanced 
prolactin  release  was  associated  with  changes  in  the  pituitary  gland,  mammary  gland,  endocrine 
pancreas, female genital tract, male accessory sex organs and adrenal glands, changes in body weight 
and QTc prolongation and testes effects, probably unrelated to exaggerated pharmacology. 
In similarity to risperidone, paliperidone showed no genotoxic potential. However, in carcinogenicity 
studies  performed  with  risperidone in mice  and  rats,  treatment  related  tumour  findings  in  the 
mammary gland, endocrine pancreas and pituitary were noted. Paliperidone was not teratogenic in rat 
and rabbit, but showed embryotoxicity at a maternally toxic dose in rats. 
In conclusion, similar toxicity profiles were seen after administration of paliperidone and risperidone. 
No unexpected findings were noted after paliperidone treatment.  Since photogenotoxicity cannot be 
adequately  evaluated  using  clinical  safety  data  the  Applicant  is  requested  to  submit  an  in  vitro 
photomutagenicity test as a follow-up measure. 
Efficacy 
In total 1982 subjects were screened across the 3 short-term phase 3 pivotal studies (SCH-303, SCH-
304,  and  SCH-305)  constituting  the  clinical  development  program  for  paliperidone  ER  OROS  in 
schizophrenia, from which 1692 subjects were enrolled and randomised to double-blind treatment. A 
total of 972 subjects completed these studies. Overall, the clinical program is adequate with respect to 
experimental design, diagnostic criteria and study endpoints. 
The  three  phase  III  short-term  studies  performed  are  of  adequate  design  and demonstrate short-term 
efficacy of different fixed doses (3-15 mg) of paliperidone ER OROS in patients experiencing an acute 
episode of schizophrenia. In these studies, a consistent effect for all doses relative to placebo has been 
demonstrated and the effect size is as expected for an anti-psychotic drug, and indeed it is comparable 
to olanzapine, the active comparator in the studies. 
Controlled  data  on  maintenance  of  effect  consists  of  a  study  (SCH-301)  designed  to  demonstrate 
recurrence prevention. A total of 530 subjects were enrolled in the open-label run-in phase, of which 
312  entered  the  open-label  stabilisation  phase,  and  207  were  randomized  to  double-blind  treatment. 
However, patients were included during an acute episode and despite 14 weeks of open label active 
treatment prior to randomisation most of the separation between the recurrence-free curves occurred 
during the first weeks after randomisation. This indicates that relapse rather than recurrence prevention 
has  been  demonstrated,  and  the  study  is  not  sufficient  to  support  a  recurrence  prevention  claim. 
Nevertheless, the results are supportive of a maintained effect for patients who initially respond. 
An additional phase 3 short-term study (SCH-302) was performed on a total of 114 elderly (65 years 
of age or older) schizophrenic patients to determine, compared to placebo, the safety and efficacy of 
flexibly dosed Invega administered once daily for 6 weeks. A significant, but less pronounced effect 
has been demonstrated in elderly patients.

Safety 
At the time of MAA submission, the combined exposure to paliperidone ER across all Phase 3 studies 
(completed  and  ongoing)  was  921.31  subject-years  for  the  2,054  subjects  with  schizophrenia  who 
received  at  least  1  dose  of  paliperidone  ER  across  the  dose  range  of  3  mg  to  15  mg.  Based  on  the 
cumulative  safety  results  presented,  the  combined  exposure  to  paliperidone  ER  in  Phase  3  clinical 
trials in 2,054 adults and elderly subjects with schizophrenia is 1092.88 subject-years. This represents 
an increase of 171.57 patient-years. 
Across all Phase 3 studies, 562 subjects were treated for more than 1 year (>52 weeks), including 415 
subjects in the pooled Phase 3 studies (Studies R076477-SCH-302, -303, -304, -305, -702, -703, -704, 
and -705) and 147 subjects in Studies R076477-SCH-301/701. 
Through  the  cut-off  date  of  26  June  2006  (31  August  for  deaths  and  other  serious  adverse  events), 
there were a total of 10 deaths in all completed and ongoing studies of paliperidone ER. 
tachycardia,  bradycardia,  akathisia,  sinus 
The  most  common  ADRs  observed  with  Invega  that  were  treatment  related  were  headache,  weight 
increase, 
tachycardia,  extrapyramidal  symptoms, 
somnolence, dizziness, sedation, tremor, hypertonia, dystonia, orthostatic hypotension, dry mouth and 
QTc prolonged. Asymptomatic increase of serum prolactin levels is very frequent. 
Overall,  discontinuation  rate  due  to  adverse  events  was  similar  for  placebo  and  Invega  across  all 
studies. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Having  considered  the  safety  concerns  in  the  risk  management  plan,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the 
proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these. 
Overall,  the  safety  profile  is  as expected for an  active metabolite of risperidone. Thus, the available 
information indicates that the risks associated with use of paliperidone in adults with schizophrenia are 
acceptable and similar to risperidone at recommended doses. 
•  User consultation 
User  testing  has  been  performed  on  the  Patient  Information  Leaflet  and  from  the  results  it  can  be 
concluded that the relevant information is accessible and understandable for the patients. 
Risk-benefit assessment 
Efficacy of paliperidone in the treatment of schizophrenia has been demonstrated relative to placebo 
and  with  a  magnitude  of  effect  similar  to  the  active  comparator  olanzapine  and  to  what  have  been 
observed  for  other  drugs  for  treatment  of  schizophrenia.    In  addition,  studies  of  sufficient  duration 
according  to  guidelines  have  demonstrated  maintenance  of  effect  in  patients  initially  responding  to 
treatment. 
The extended release formulation may enhance initial tolerability and permits initiation of treatment 
without the need for dose titration, and this may represent an advantage compared to IR risperidone. 
Human pharmacokinetic studies have shown a food interaction, which may increase the variability in 
exposure.  Standardised  administration  of  paliperidone  in  relation  to  food  intake  is  therefore 
recommended.

In non-clinical studies, similar pharmacological and toxicological profiles after administration of 
paliperidone and risperidone were demonstrated. Since photogenotoxicity cannot be adequately 
evaluated using clinical safety data, the Applicant is requested to submit an in vitro photomutagenicity 
test as a follow-up measure. 
The clinical safety profile is as expected for an active metabolite of risperidone and appears similar to 
that  of  risperidone.  The  available  information  indicates  that  the  risks  associated  with  the  use  of 
paliperidone  in  adults  with  schizophrenia  are  acceptable  and  similar  to  risperidone  at  recommended 
doses. 
The  most  common  ADRs  observed  with  Invega  that  were  treatment  related  were  headache,  weight

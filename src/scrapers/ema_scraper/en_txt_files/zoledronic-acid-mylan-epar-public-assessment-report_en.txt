2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Zoledronic acid is a bisphosphonate. It stops the action of the osteoclasts, the cells in the body that 
are involved in breaking down the bone tissue. This leads to less bone loss. The reduction of bone loss 
helps to make bones less likely to break, which is useful in preventing fractures in cancer patients with 
bone metastases. 
Patients with tumours can have high levels of calcium in their blood, released from the bones. By 
preventing the breakdown of bones, Zoledronic acid also helps to reduce the amount of calcium 
released into the blood. 
Zoledronic acid Mylan is an application made according to Article 10 (1) generic application of Directive 
2001/83/EC. For this application, the reference medicinal product authorised in the Community not 
less than 6/10 years ago is Zometa 4 mg powder and solvent for solution for infusion and 4mg/5ml 
concentrate for solution for infusion, by Novartis Europharm Limited. Zometa 4mg powder and solvent 
for solution for infusion was authorised in the EU on the 20 March 2001 (EU/1/01/176/001-003). 
Zometa 4mg/5ml concentrate for solution for infusion was authorised on the 24 March 2003 as a line 
extension to Zometa 4mg powder and solvent for infusion (EU/1/01/176/004-006); this license 
belongs to the same global marketing authorisation. Zometa 4mg/100ml solution for infusion was also 
authorised as a line extension (EU/1/01/176/007-009) on the 24 August 2011 under the same global 
marketing authorisation. 
The Zoledronic acid Mylan is designed to be aqueous in nature, contains the same active substance as 
Zometa and is intended for parenteral administration; in view of this there is no requirement for 
bioequivalence testing (cf.CPMP/QWP/EWP/1401/98 Rev. 1). 
The applicant applied for all the indications of the reference product (Zometa):  
 
Prevention of skeletal related events (pathological fractures, spinal compression, radiation or 
surgery to bone, or tumour-induced hypercalcaemia) in adult patients with advanced 
malignancies involving bone. 
 
Treatment of adult patients with tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH).  
Zoledronic acid Mylan must only be prescribed and administered to patients by healthcare 
professionals experienced in the administration of intravenous bisphosphonates. 
The recommended dose in the prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced 
malignancies involving bone is 4 mg zoledronic acid every 3 to 4 weeks. 
Patients should also be administered an oral calcium supplement of 500 mg and 400 IU vitamin D 
daily. 
The decision to treat patients with bone metastases for the prevention of skeletal related events should 
consider that the onset of treatment effect is 2-3 months. 
The recommended dose in hypercalcaemia is a single dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid.  
In patients with renal impairment, the dosing instructions and monitoring of serum creatinine as 
detailed in SmPC section 4.2 should be followed.  
Zoledronic acid Mylan

Zoledronic acid Mylan 4 mg/5 ml concentrate for solution for infusion, further diluted in 100 ml should 
be given as a single intravenous infusion in no less than 15 minutes. Patients must be maintained well 
hydrated prior to and following administration of Zoledronic acid Mylan. 
The safety and efficacy of zoledronic acid in children aged 1 year to 17 years have not been 
established. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The product is presented as concentrate for solution for infusion containing 4 mg/5 ml of zoledronic 
acid as active substance.  
Other ingredients are defined in the SPC section 6.1.   
The product is packed in clear glass vials with bromobutyl rubber stoppers and aluminium cap with a 
flip-off component in packs of 1, 4 and 10 vials. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
The active substance used in Zoledronic acid Mylan is sourced from two suppliers. The information on 
the active substance is presented in the form of an Active Substance Master File for both of them. 
The active substance of Zoledronic acid Mylan is zoledronic acid monohydrate, which has the chemical 
name: 1-Hydroxy-2-(1H-imidazolyl)ethylene-1,1-diphosphoric acid monohydrate. It corresponds to the 
molecular formula C5H10N2O7P2.H2O and relative molecular mass of 290.1.  
It appears as a white to almost white crystalline powder, soluble in 0.1N sodium hydroxide solution, 
slightly soluble in water and practically insoluble in organic solvents. The pH of aqueous suspension is 
between 2 and 3. It does not exhibit stereo isomerism as it does not contain chiral centre but shows 
polymorphism. It has been confirmed by data that zoledronic acid manufactured by both active 
substance suppliers is consistent with regard to the crystalline form.  
Manufacture 
The information on the active substance is presented in the form of an Active Substance Master File 
from both suppliers. 
Detailed information regarding the control of starting materials, reagents and raw materials as well as 
the control of critical steps and intermediates is provided in the ASMF.  
The synthesis process is sufficiently described in the ASMFs, the choice of the starting materials has 
been justified, and so have been the process controls, specifications and test methods. Satisfactory 
information on the validation of production batches, on the manufacturing process development and on 
the methods used in the control of the starting materials was also provided.

CHMP assessment report  
Page 8/34
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The ASMF holders have adequately discussed the potential carry-over of reagents, solvents and 
auxiliary material and their presence in the final active substance. 
Specification 
The specification of the active substance as set up by the drug product manufacturer includes tests and 
limits for appearance (visual), solubility (Ph.Eur.), clarity and colour index (UV), identification (IR, 
HPLC, XRD), water content (Ph.Eur.) or loss on drying (Ph.Eur.), heavy metals (Ph.Eur.), assay 
(HPLC), impurities (HPLC), pH (Ph.Eur.), sulphate and chloride (analytical balance), residual solvents 
(GC), particle size distribution (laser light diffraction), microbiological quality (Ph.Eur.), bacterial 
endotoxins  (Ph.Eur.), and palladium (ICP). 
The specifications are adequate to control the quality of the active substance. The impurity limits are 
acceptable and there is no concern from the point of view of safety.  
Batch analysis data is presented in the ASMFs for three production batches. All the results reported are 
all within the proposed specifications.  
Stability 
Stability studies on three production batches of zoledronic acid monohydrate as bulk drug substance 
packaged in the proposed material were carried out by the first supplier in accordance with current ICH 
conditions under long term conditions (30°C±2°C/65%±5%RH) and accelerated conditions 
(40°C±2°C/75%±5%RH). 
For stability studies carried out at long term conditions results are available for a time period of 48 
months. For the studies performed at accelerated conditions results are presented for a time period of 
6 months.  
Stability studies on three production batches of zoledronic acid monohydrate as bulk drug substance 
packaged in the proposed material were carried out by the second supplier in accordance with current 
ICH conditions under long term conditions (25°C±2°C/60%±5%RH) and accelerated conditions 
(40°C±2°C/75%±5%RH). 
For stability studies carried out at long term conditions results are available for a time period of 36 
months. For the studies performed at accelerated conditions results are presented for a time period of 
6 months.  
Samples were tested for parameters that are susceptible to change during storage (description, water 
content, related substances and assay) using validated analytical methods shown to be stability 
indicating. At all time points all tested parameters are within the limits of the drug substance 
specification.  
Stress studies (forced degradation studies) 
Forced degradation studies were conducted by both suppliers. Under the tested conditions the active 
substance showed to be stable under acidic and alkalic conditions as well as under light and 
temperature but susceptible to oxidation. 
Based on the stability data provided the proposed re-test period is supported.

2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Pharmaceutical development 
The objective was to develop a generic product similar in formulation, dosage form, concentration and 
use to the reference drug product Zometa 4 mg/5 ml concentrate for solution for infusion. 
Zoledronic acid Mylan 4 mg/5 ml concentrate for solution for infusion is a clear and colourless solution 
filled in type I glass vial of 15 ml. Each vial contains a quantity of 4.264 mg Zoledronic acid 
monohydrate equivalent to 4.0 mg of anhydrous Zoledronic acid. 
All excipients which are used for the manufacture of the drug product are monographed in Ph. Eur. 
Zoledronic acid Mylan was formulated on the basis of the innovator composition with a sodium citrate 
buffer. No new excipient was introduced in the proposed formulation except sodium hydroxide and 
hydrochloric acid. These excipients are commonly used for pH adjustment and generally do not 
generate any compatibility problem. Therefore no specific compatibility studies were warranted.  
Different formulae were developed and tested. Appearance and pH are relevant for the biological 
properties and the stability of the drug product. In order to compare the stability profile of different 
developed formulae and to highlight conditions which could degrade the drug product a stress study 
was performed. According to the obtained study results the physicochemical characteristics of the 
proposed product that can influence the performance and manufacturability of the drug product are 
considered similar to those of Zometa 4 mg/ 5 ml concentrate for solution for infusion. 
Furthermore, the osmolality of the diluted solution was compared between reference product and the 
proposed medicinal product. It was concluded that the proposed medicinal product when diluted in 0.9 
% w/v Sodium chloride solution and 5 % w/v Glucose solution has the same osmolality as the 
reference product diluted in the same conditions. 
Appropriate studies to evaluate the risk of formation of insoluble complexes with divalent cations which 
are constituents of pharmaceutical glass have been presented. Overall the provided data and the 
toxicological assessment were considered sufficient and the choice of the proposed glass vials as 
primary container of Zoledronic acid Mylan can be considered justified. 
The manufacturing process is considered as a “standard process” according to CPMP/QWP/848/96 Note 
for Guidance on Process Validation. The manufacture of this non-heat sensitive solution for infusion 
filled in glass vials consists of compounding, filtration, filling and terminal sterilisation. 
A stress study was performed to define potential manufacturing conditions which could degrade the 
drug product. Zoledronic acid solutions were exposed to different stress conditions. According to the 
results of the stress study the optimal parameters with regards to stability and intravenous 
administration were defined. It was further concluded that the drug product sterilisation method, 
packaging and proposed storage conditions were suitable. 
In the course of the manufacturing process development the optimum introduction of components with 
regard to active substance dissolution time was established.  
Holding times set after relevant steps of the manufacturing process are considered justified. The 
absence of any adsorption of the actives substance during the filtration steps was checked during 
process validation.  
The method of sterilisation was chosen in compliance with the requirements of the European 
Pharmacopoeia and the EMEA guideline CPMP/QWP/054/98. Terminal sterilisation was selected due to 
stability of the formulation.

Since the drug product is intended for parenteral use, the sterility of the solution is of importance. The 
microbial quality is therefore monitored during the manufacturing process and at release. Furthermore, 
as the drug substance is administered by injection no visible particle and a limited quantity of sub-
visible particles should be present. Visible particles are monitored during the manufacturing process 
and visible and sub-visible particles are controlled at release. 
During manufacture of the drug product an overfilling is performed. The overfilling ensures a minimal 
extractable volume of 5 ml concentrate which corresponds to a labelled amount of 4 mg anhydrous 
Zoledronic acid per vial in accordance with the SmPC. 
Adventitious agents 
No TSE risk materials are used in the manufacture of the finished product.  
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process is described sufficiently and is controlled by adequate in-process controls. 
A list of equipment used during the manufacturing process is provided. 
As the manufacturing process is considered as a standard process it is sufficient that process validation 
data for three pilot batches were provided. The actual commercial batch size has been defined. 
The sterilisation methods of the final product (terminal sterilisation) and of the primary packaging 
materials are according to Ph. Eur.  
A survey table on critical steps, tested parameters, acceptance limits and applied test methods is 
presented. Overall the provided information is considered adequate and sufficient. 
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications includes tests and limits for appearance 
(visually), clarity and degree of opalescence (Ph.Eur.), identification of active substance (HPLC, UV), 
pH (Ph.Eur.), impurities (HPLC), extractable volume (Ph.Eur.), particulate contamination (Ph.Eur.), 
bacterial endotoxins (Ph.Eur.), sterility (Ph.Eur.) and assay (Ph.Eur.). 
Batch analyses data and Certificates of analysis are presented for three validation batches 
manufactured using active substance from one of the two suppliers. 
For all parameters the obtained results from batch analyses are within the limits defined in the release 
specification. 
The applicant committed to validate the manufacturing process for the first finished product batch 
manufactured with the drug substance supplied by the other supplier according to a presented 
protocol. In view of this and the fact that the quality of the drug substance from both suppliers was 
shown to be similar it has been accepted that batch analyses data from batches manufactured with 
active substance from the other suppliers were not available prior to authorisation.  
All results reported indicate that the process is under control, confirming consistency and uniformity of 
manufacture. 
Stability of the product 
Stability studies were performed with three validation batches under long term conditions 
(25°C±2°C/60%RH±5%RH) and under accelerated conditions (40°C±2°C/75%RH±5%RH). The vials 
were positioned upside and downside. For all three batches results from stability studies over a time 
Zoledronic acid Mylan 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 11/34
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
period of 12 months under long term conditions and 6 months under accelerated conditions were 
presented. All tested parameters (appearance, clarity and degree of opalescence, pH, phosphate and 
phosphite, impurities, particulate contamination sterility, assay and bacterial endotoxins) remained 
within the specifications. 
In-use stability study 
An in-use stability study was carried out with one validation batch stored nine months at 25°C/60%RH 
after dilution in 0.9%w/v Sodium chloride solution and 5%w/v Glucose solution. The drug product was 
packaged as for sale. The commercial packaging for the perfusion diluent is a polyolefin bag. 
The analytical procedures used are those for the control of the drug product at release and are stability 
indicating. According to CPMP/QWP/2934/99 the study will be repeated with one batch chosen at the 
end of its shelf-life when available. According to the obtained results Zoledronic acid Mylan was 
demonstrated to be stable up to 48 hours after dilution at extreme concentrations in 100 ml 0.9 %w/v 
Sodium chloride or 5% w/v Glucose solution when stored at 4°C or 25°C. 
Photostability study 
Photostability testing was carried out with one batch according to the relevant guideline. The drug 
product was packaged in the proposed packaging. The analytical procedures used are those for the 
control of the drug product at release. According to the obtained results the primary and secondary 
packaging provide the necessary protection from light. Although a slight degradation is observed when 
the product is stored in its primary packaging the product quality remains within the specification. The 
results are in line with the photostability results of the drug substance from both sources and those 
obtained for process development on the bulk solution.  
In conclusion, stability studies were carried out according to the relevant ICH/CPMP guidelines and 
included parameters susceptible to change. The obtained results for the tested parameters at all time 
points are within the limits defined in the shelf-life specification.  
An adequate compatibility study for the stability of Zoledronic acid 4 mg/ 5 ml concentrate diluted in 
0.9%w/v Sodium chloride solution and 5%w/v Glucose solution was performed.  
In the course of the stability studies an additional limit test for two identified impurities was carried out 
by a suitable and adequately validated method. These two impurities are identified as potential 
inorganic impurities of zoledronic acid monohydrate. It has been shown they are process related 
impurities and not degradation products and therefore are not specified as a routine basis in the drug 
product specifications. 
Based on the results of the stability studies, the proposed shelf-life when stored in the original 
packaging and the storage conditions stated in the SmPC are acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and 
uniformity  of  important  product  quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the  conclusion  that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.3.  Non- clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no 
need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The 
non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity 
profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/Environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Zoledronic acid Mylan is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the 
combined sales volumes for all zoledronic acid containing products and the exposure of the 
environment to the active substance. Thus, the environmental risk is expected to be similar and not 
increased.

Section 4.2 
Renal impairment 
TIH: 
Zoledronic acid treatment in TIH 
patients who also have severe renal 
impairment should be considered only 
after evaluating the risks and benefits 
of treatment. In the clinical studies, 
patients with serum creatinine > 
400 μmol/l or > 4.5 mg/dl were 
excluded. No dose adjustment is 
necessary in TIH patients with serum 
creatinine < 400 μmol/l or < 
4.5 mg/dl (see section 4.4). 
Prevention of skeletal related events in 
patients with advanced malignancies 
involving bone: 
When initiating treatment with 
zoledronic acid in patients with 
multiple myeloma or metastatic bone 
lesions from solid tumours, serum 
creatinine and creatinine clearance 
(CLcr) should be determined. CLcr is 
calculated from serum creatinine using 
the Cockcroft-Gault formula. 
Zoledronic acid is not recommended 
for patients presenting with severe 
renal impairment prior to initiation of 
therapy, which is defined for this 
population as CLcr < 30 ml/min. In 
clinical trials with zoledronic acid, 
patients with serum creatinine > 
265 μmol/l or > 3.0 mg/dl were 
excluded.

(CLcr=75 ml/min). The reduced doses 
for patients with renal impairment are 
expected to achieve the same AUC as 
that seen in patients with creatinine 
clearance of 75 ml/min. 
Following initiation of therapy, serum 
creatinine should be measured prior to 
each dose of zoledronic acid and 
treatment should be withheld if renal 
function has deteriorated. In the 
clinical trials, renal deterioration was 
defined as follows: 
For patients with normal baseline 
serum creatinine (< 1.4 mg/dl or 
< 124 μmol/l), an increase of 
0.5 mg/dl or 44 μmol/l; 
For patients with abnormal baseline 
creatinine (> 1.4 mg/dl or 
> 124 μmol/l), an increase of 
1.0 mg/dl or 88 μmol/l. 
In the clinical studies, zoledronic acid 
treatment was resumed only when the 
creatinine level returned to within 10% 
of the baseline value (see section 4.4). 
Zoledronic acid treatment should be 
resumed at the same dose as that 
given prior to treatment interruption. 
Section 4.4 
Renal insufficiency 
Patients with TIH and evidence of 
deterioration in renal function should 
be appropriately evaluated with 
consideration given as to whether the 
potential benefit of treatment with 
zoledronic acid outweighs the possible 
risk. 
The decision to treat patients with 
bone metastases for the prevention of 
skeletal related events should consider 
that the onset of treatment effect is 2–
3 months. 
Zoledronic acid has been associated 
with reports of renal dysfunction.

potential for deterioration in renal 
function include dehydration, pre-
existing renal impairment, multiple 
cycles of zoledronic acid and other 
bisphosphonates as well as use of 
other nephrotoxic medicinal products. 
While the risk is reduced with a dose 
of 4 mg zoledronic acid administered 
over 15 minutes, deterioration in renal 
function may still occur. Renal 
deterioration, progression to renal 
failure and dialysis have been reported 
in patients after the initial dose or a 
single dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid. 
Increases in serum creatinine also 
occur in some patients with chronic 
administration of zoledronic acid at 
recommended doses for prevention of 
skeletal related events, although less 
frequently. 
Patients should have their serum 
creatinine levels assessed prior to 
each dose of zoledronic acid. Upon 
initiation of treatment in patients with 
bone metastases with mild to 
moderate renal impairment, lower 
doses of zoledronic acid are 
recommended. In patients who show 
evidence of renal deterioration during 
treatment, zoledronic acid should be 
withheld. Zoledronic acid should only 
be resumed when serum creatinine 
returns to within 10% of baseline. 
Zoledronic acid treatment should be 
resumed at the same dose as that 
given prior to treatment interruption. 
In view of the potential impact of 
zoledronic acid on renal function, the 
lack of clinical safety data in patients 
with severe renal impairment (in 
clinical trials defined as serum 
creatinine ≥ 400 μmol/l or 
≥ 4.5 mg/dl for patients with TIH and 
≥ 265 μmol/l or ≥ 3.0 mg/dl for 
patients with cancer and bone 
metastases, respectively) at baseline 
and only limited pharmacokinetic data 
in patients with severe renal 
impairment at baseline (creatinine 
clearance < 30 ml/min), the use of 
zoledronic acid is not recommended in 
patients with severe renal impairment. 
Section 4.5 
Caution is indicated when zoledronic 
acid is used with other potentially 
nephrotoxic medicinal products. 
In multiple myeloma patients, the risk 
of renal dysfunction may be increased 
when zoledronic acid is used in 
combination with thalidomide.

Renal function impairment 
Zoledronic acid has been associated 
with reports of renal dysfunction. In a 
pooled analysis of safety data from 
zoledronic acid registration trials for 
the prevention of skeletal-related 
events in patients with advanced 
malignancies involving bone, the 
frequency of renal impairment adverse 
events suspected to be related to 
zoledronic acid (adverse reactions) 
was as follows: multiple myeloma 
(3.2%), prostate cancer (3.1%), 
breast cancer (4.3%), lung and other 
solid tumours (3.2%). Factors that 
may increase the potential for 
deterioration in renal function include 
dehydration, pre-existing renal 
impairment, multiple cycles of 
zoledronic acid or other 
bisphosphonates, as well as 
concomitant use of nephrotoxic 
medicinal products or using a shorter

majority of reported cases have been 
associated with dental procedures 
such as tooth extraction. Many had 
signs of local infection including 
osteomyelitis.  
A dental examination with appropriate 
preventive dentistry should be 
considered prior to treatment with 
bisphosphonates in patients with 
concomitant risk factors (e.g. cancer, 
chemotherapy, corticosteroids, poor 
oral hygiene). 
While on treatment, these patients 
should avoid invasive dental 
procedures if possible. For patients 
who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw 
while on bisphosphonate therapy, 
dental surgery may exacerbate the 
condition. For patients requiring dental 
procedures, there are no data 
available to suggest whether 
discontinuation of bisphosphonate 
treatment reduces the risk of 
osteonecrosis of the jaw. Clinical 
judgement of the treating physician 
should guide the management plan of 
each patient based on individual 
benefit/risk assessment.

Description of selected adverse 
reactions 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw 
Cases of osteonecrosis (primarily of 
the jaws) have been reported, 
predominantly in cancer patients 
treated with medicinal products that 
inhibit bone resorption, such as 
zoledronic acid. Many of these patients 
had signs of local infection including 
osteomyelitis, and the majority of the 
reports refer to cancer patients 
following tooth extractions or other 
dental surgeries. Osteonecrosis of the 
jaws has multiple documented risk 
factors including a diagnosis of cancer, 
concomitant therapies (e.g. 
chemotherapy, radiotherapy, 
corticosteroids) and co-morbid 
conditions (e.g. anaemia, 
coagulopathies, infection, pre-existing 
oral disease). Although causality has 
not been determined, it is 
recommended to avoid dental surgery 
as recovery may be prolonged (see 
section 4.4).

Summary of the safety profile 
Within three days after zoledronic acid 
administration, an acute phase 
reaction has commonly been reported, 
with symptoms including bone pain, 
fever, fatigue, arthralgia, myalgia and

Section 4.2 
Prevention of skeletal related events in 
patients with advanced malignancies 
involving bone 
Adults and elderly 
The recommended dose in the 
prevention of skeletal related events in 
patients with advanced malignancies 
involving bone is 4 mg zoledronic acid 
every 3 to 4 weeks. 
Patients should also be administered 
an oral calcium supplement of 500 mg 
and 400 IU vitamin D daily. 
Section 4.4 
Standard hypercalcaemia-related 
metabolic parameters, such as serum 
levels of calcium, phosphate and 
magnesium, should be carefully 
monitored after initiating zoledronic 
acid therapy. If hypocalcaemia, 
hypophosphataemia, or 
hypomagnesaemia occurs, short-term 
supplemental therapy may be 
necessary. Untreated hypercalcaemia 
patients generally have some degree 
of renal function impairment, therefore 
careful renal function monitoring 
should be considered. 
Section 4.5 
Caution is advised when 
bisphosphonates are administered with 
aminoglycosides, since both agents 
may have an additive effect, resulting 
in a lower serum calcium level for 
longer periods than required.

Atrial fibrillation 
In one 3-year, randomised, double-

efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid 
5 mg once yearly vs. placebo in the 
treatment of postmenopausal 
osteoporosis (PMO), the overall 
incidence of atrial fibrillation was 2.5% 
(96 out of 3,862) and 1.9% (75 out of 
3,852) in patients receiving zoledronic 
acid 5 mg and placebo, respectively. 
The rate of atrial fibrillation serious 
adverse events was 1.3% (51 out of 
3,862) and 0.6% (22 out of 3,852) in 
patients receiving zoledronic acid 5 mg 
and placebo, respectively. The 
imbalance observed in this trial has 
not been observed in other trials with 
zoledronic acid, including those with 
zoledronic acid 4 mg every 3-4 weeks 
in oncology patients. The mechanism 
behind the increased incidence of atrial 
fibrillation in this single clinical trial is 
unknown.

Atypical fractures of the femur 
Atypical subtrochanteric and 
diaphyseal femoral fractures have 
been reported with bisphosphonate 
therapy, primarily in patients receiving 
long-term treatment for osteoporosis. 
These transverse or short oblique 
fractures can occur anywhere along 
the femur from just below the lesser 
trochanter to just above the 
supracondylar flare. These fractures 
occur after minimal or no trauma and 
some patients experience thigh or 
groin pain, often associated with 
imaging features of stress fractures, 
weeks to months before presenting 
with a completed femoral fracture. 
Fractures are often bilateral; therefore 
the contralateral femur should be 
examined in bisphosphonate-treated 
patients who have sustained a femoral 
shaft fracture. Poor healing of these 
fractures has also been reported. 
Discontinuation of bisphosphonate 
therapy in patients suspected to have 
an atypical femur fracture should be 
considered pending evaluation of the 
patient, based on an individual benefit 
risk assessment. 
During bisphosphonate treatment 
patients should be advised to report 
any thigh, hip or groin pain and any 
patient presenting with such 
symptoms should be evaluated for an 
incomplete femur fracture.

bone metastases for the prevention of 
skeletal related events should consider 
that the onset of treatment effect is 2–
3 months. 
Zoledronic acid has been associated 
with reports of renal dysfunction. 
Factors that may increase the 
potential for deterioration in renal 
function include dehydration, pre-
existing renal impairment, multiple 
cycles of zoledronic acid and other 
bisphosphonates as well as use of 
other nephrotoxic medicinal products. 
While the risk is reduced with a dose 
of 4 mg zoledronic acid administered 
over 15 minutes, deterioration in renal 
function may still occur. Renal 
deterioration, progression to renal 
failure and dialysis have been reported 
in patients after the initial dose or a 
single dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid. 
Increases in serum creatinine also 
occur in some patients with chronic 
administration of zoledronic acid at 
recommended doses for prevention of 
skeletal related events, although less 
frequently. 
Patients should have their serum 
creatinine levels assessed prior to 
each dose of zoledronic acid. Upon 
initiation of treatment in patients with 
bone metastases with mild to 
moderate renal impairment, lower 
doses of zoledronic acid are 
recommended. In patients who show

evidence of renal deterioration during 
treatment, zoledronic acid should be 
withheld. Zoledronic acid should only 
be resumed when serum creatinine 
returns to within 10% of baseline. 
Zoledronic acid treatment should be 
resumed at the same dose as that 
given prior to treatment interruption. 
In view of the potential impact of 
zoledronic acid on renal function, the 
lack of clinical safety data in patients 
with severe renal impairment (in 
clinical trials defined as serum 
creatinine ≥ 400 μmol/l or 
≥ 4.5 mg/dl for patients with TIH and 
≥ 265 μmol/l or ≥ 3.0 mg/dl for 
patients with cancer and bone 
metastases, respectively) at baseline 
and only limited pharmacokinetic data 
in patients with severe renal 
impairment at baseline (creatinine 
clearance < 30 ml/min), the use of 
zoledronic acid is not recommended in 
patients with severe renal impairment. 
Section 4.5 
Caution is indicated when zoledronic 
acid is used with other potentially 
nephrotoxic medicinal products. 
Attention should also be paid to the 
possibility of hypomagnesaemia 
developing during treatment. 
In multiple myeloma patients, the risk 
of renal dysfunction may be increased 
when zoledronic acid is used in 
combination with thalidomide.

It is not known whether zoledronic 
acid is excreted into human milk. 
Zoledronic acid is contraindicated in 
breast-feeding women (see section 
4.3). 
Fertility 
Zoledronic acid was evaluated in rats 
for potential adverse effects on fertility 
of the parental and F1 generation. This 
resulted in exaggerated 
pharmacological effects considered to 
be related to the compound’s inhibition 
of skeletal calcium metabolisation, 
resulting in periparturient 
hypocalcaemia, a bisphosphonate class 
effect, dystocia and early termination 
of the study. Thus these results 
precluded determining a definitive 
effect of zoledronic acid on fertility in 
humans. 
Section 5.3 
Reproduction toxicity 
Zoledronic acid was teratogenic in the 
rat at subcutaneous doses ≥ 
0.2 mg/kg. Although no teratogenicity 
or foetotoxicity was observed in the 
rabbit, maternal toxicity was found. 
Dystocia was observed at the lowest 
dose (0.01 mg/kg bodyweight) tested 
in the rat.

Renal impairment 
TIH: 
Zoledronic acid treatment in TIH 
patients who also have severe renal 
impairment should be considered only 
after evaluating the risks and benefits 
of treatment. In the clinical studies, 
patients with serum creatinine > 
400 μmol/l or > 4.5 mg/dl were 
excluded. No dose adjustment is 
necessary in TIH patients with serum 
creatinine < 400 μmol/l or < 
4.5 mg/dl (see section 4.4). 
Prevention of skeletal related events in 
patients with advanced malignancies 
involving bone: 
When initiating treatment with 
zoledronic acid in patients with 
multiple myeloma or metastatic bone 
lesions from solid tumours, serum 
creatinine and creatinine clearance 
(CLcr) should be determined. CLcr is 
calculated from serum creatinine using 
the Cockcroft-Gault formula.

Following initiation of therapy, serum 
creatinine should be measured prior to 
each dose of zoledronic acid and 
treatment should be withheld if renal 
function has deteriorated. In the 
clinical trials, renal deterioration was 
defined as follows: 
For patients with normal baseline 
serum creatinine (< 1.4 mg/dl or 
< 124 μmol/l), an increase of 
0.5 mg/dl or 44 μmol/l; 
For patients with abnormal baseline 
creatinine (> 1.4 mg/dl or 
> 124 μmol/l), an increase of 
1.0 mg/dl or 88 μmol/l. 
In the clinical studies, zoledronic acid 
treatment was resumed only when the 
creatinine level returned to within 10% 
of the baseline value (see section 4.4). 
Zoledronic acid treatment should be 
resumed at the same dose as that

Description of selected adverse 
reactions 
Renal function impairment 
Zoledronic acid has been associated 
with reports of renal dysfunction. In a 
pooled analysis of safety data from 
zoledronic acid registration trials for 
the prevention of skeletal-related 
events in patients with advanced 
malignancies involving bone, the 
frequency of renal impairment adverse 
events suspected to be related to 
zoledronic acid (adverse reactions) 
was as follows: multiple myeloma 
(3.2%), prostate cancer (3.1%), 
breast cancer (4.3%), lung and other 
solid tumours (3.2%). Factors that 
may increase the potential for 
deterioration in renal function include 
dehydration, pre-existing renal 
impairment, multiple cycles of 
zoledronic acid or other 
bisphosphonates, as well as 
concomitant use of nephrotoxic 
medicinal products or using a shorter 
infusion time than currently 
recommended. Renal deterioration, 
progression to renal failure and 
dialysis have been reported in patients 
after the initial dose or a single dose of 
4 mg zoledronic acid (see section 4.4).

3.  Benefit-risk balance  
This application concerns a generic version of zoledronic acid concentrate for solution for infusion 
(4mg/ 5 ml). The reference product Zometa is indicated for the prevention of skeletal related events 
(pathological fractures, spinal compression, radiation or surgery to bone, or tumour-induced

hypercalcaemia) in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone, and for treatment of tumour-
induced hypercalcaemia (TIH).  
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the 
available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. 
From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical 
overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered 
sufficient. 
There are no bioequivalence studies submitted with this application, and this is not required under the 
provisions of the “Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence” (CPMP/QWP/EWP/1401/98 Rev.1), 
as the test product is to be administered as an aqueous intravenous solution containing the same 
active substance as the currently approved product. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen 
reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are 
required beyond those included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Zoledronic acid Mylan in the:

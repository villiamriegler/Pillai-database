2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Ovarian cancer is one of the most common gynaecological tumours in Europe and the United States. 
The incidence of ovarian cancer varies by geographic region, with the highest rates observed in North 
America, Europe, and other developed countries. Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer 
death in women. 
The most common group of ovarian cancers that arise in the epithelium are epithelial ovarian cancer 
(EOC), fallopian tube cancer (FTC) and/or primary peritoneal cancer (PPC). The recommendation of the 
International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) is that treatment for PPC and FTC 
follows the guidance for EOC. Throughout this document the term ovarian cancer is used to refer to all 
three diseases. 
The definitive diagnosis and staging of ovarian cancer is by surgery, and cytological or histological 
examination of tissue samples. The FIGO surgical staging system is used for epithelial ovarian cancer 
and primary peritoneal adenocarcinoma. Because the disease tends to be asymptomatic in early 
Assessment report

stages, or associated with vague, non-specific symptoms, the majority of patients are diagnosed with 
advanced stage disease.  
Despite the high sensitivity of ovarian cancer to initial treatment with platinum and taxane combination 
chemotherapy (following cytoreductive surgery), which is the standard of care in the front-line setting, 
the majority of women diagnosed with advanced-stage disease will have a recurrence of their cancer. 
Recurrent disease is classified as platinum resistant or platinum sensitive, depending on whether the 
disease recurred less than or greater than 6 months following previous platinum therapy, and this 
classification is highly prognostic and is important in determining optimal chemotherapeutic treatment 
options. This time between last platinum therapy and disease relapse is referred to as the platinum-
free interval (PFI). Patients with PFI ≥ 6 months have a better prognosis; response rates to single-
agent platinum have a range of 32%–57%. Platinum-resistant disease (PFI < 6 months) response 
rates range from 15% to 20%, and response duration is often measured in weeks. Platinum 
combinations have become the accepted standard for the treatment of platinum-sensitive, recurrent 
disease and currently available options include platinum plus gemcitabine, taxane, or liposomal 
doxorubicin.  
Although patients with platinum-sensitive disease do benefit from currently available regimens, their 
chemotherapy-free interval and disease control period may be relatively short; moreover, these will 
progressively shorten with subsequent relapses, which are generally accompanied by symptomatic 
disease progression (PD) with significantly lower rates of response. 
Bevacizumab  (Avastin)  is  a  recombinant  humanised  monoclonal  antibody.  It  inhibits  angiogenesis  by 
neutralising  all  isoforms  of  human  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  (VEGF),  and  blocking  their 
binding to VEGF receptors. 
Avastin  was  approved  in  the  European  Union  (EU)  on  12  January  2005  for  the  first-line  treatment  of 
patients  with  metastatic  cancer  of  the  colon  or  rectum  (mCRC),  in  combination  with  intravenous  5- 
fluorouracil/folinic acid or intravenous 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid/irinotecan. Following this, Avastin was 
approved  for  the  treatment  of  locally  recurrent  and  metastatic  breast  cancer,  for  non-small  cell  lung 
cancer (NSCLC) for renal cell cancer and for the first-line ovarian cancer. 
This variation concerns an application for extension of the approved indications for Avastin. The 
indication initially claimed by the MAH was: 
Avastin, in combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine is indicated for the treatment of patients with 
recurrent, platinum-sensitive, epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. 
The final indication approved by the CHMP is as follows: 
Bevacizumab,  in  combination  with  carboplatin  and  gemcitabine,  is  indicated  for  treatment  of  adult 
patients  with  first  recurrence  of  platinum-sensitive  epithelian  ovarian,  fallopian  tube  or  primary 
peritoneal  cancer  who  have  not  received  prior  therapy  with  bevacizumab  or  other  VEGF  inhibitors  or 
VEGF receptor–targeted agents”. 
Consequently, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated to reflect the change in 
the  indication  accordingly.  The  PL  has  been  updated  accordingly.  In  addition,  Annex  II  has  been 
updated in order to revise the list of conditions. Furthermore, the MAH took this opportunity to bring 
the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 8.

2.2 Non clinical aspects  
2.2.1 Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment  
A justification for not providing an updated Environmental Risk assessment for this new indication HAS 
has  been  submitted  by  the  MAH.  This  is  in  accordance  with  the  Guideline  on  the  Environmental  Risk 
assessment  for  Human  medicinal  products  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00,  2006)  which  states  that  for 
certain  pharmacologically  active  substances,  among  others  proteins,  such  is  possible,  as  these 
substances are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment.  
Bevacizumab  is  a  monoclonal  antibody  that  is  a  recombinant  humanised  immunoglobulin  of  isotype 
IgG1 and as a protein bevacizumab is exempted from providing an ERA.  
The old ERA from 2006 and a recent publication on proteins and pharmaceuticals supporting the 
conclusion of no significant environmental risk have been included in the application and have not 
raised any concerns. 
2.3 Clinical aspects 
2.3.1 Pharmacokinetic interactions studies 
The  chemotherapies  used  in  combination  with  bevacizumab  in  Study  AVF4095g  were  carboplatin  and 
gemcitabine.  Pharmacokinetic  drug-drug  interaction  (PK-DDI)  between  bevacizumab,  carboplatin  and 
gemcitabine  was  not  assessed  specifically  in  EOC,  PPC,  and  FTC.  Available  PK-DDI  results  for  the 
impact  of  bevacizumab  on  carboplatin  and  gemcitabine  disposition  presented  are  from  studies 
AVF0757g and BO17704 in NSCLC and study BO17706 in pancreatic cancer.  
In  Study AVF0757g,  the  pharmacokinetics  of  carboplatin  and  paclitaxel  was evaluated  in combination 
with  bevacizumab  in  patients  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  NSCLC.  Carboplatin  plasma 
concentration data were collected at Day 0 and Day 63 and were available for 6 patients in the control 
arm. In the bevacizumab treated arm, 9 patients had concentration data for carboplatin. On the basis 
of  limited  data,  there  did  not  appear  to  be  a  difference  in  the  exposure  when  carboplatin  was 
administered in combination with bevacizumab, suggesting a lack of PK-DDI with bevacizumab.   
A PK-DDI substudy within study BO17704 evaluated the impact of bevacizumab (either 7.5 mg/kg or 
15  mg/kg  every  3  weeks)  and  cisplatin  on  gemcitabine pharmacokinetics in a  subset  of  patients  with 
locally  advanced,  metastatic,  or  recurrent  NSCLC.  Forty-one  patients  were  enrolled  in  the  substudy; 
however,  data  was  available  for  parameter  estimates  on  only  a  limited  number  of  patients.  AUC0-inf 
could be calculated only in 13 patients from the low-dose group and in 7 patients from the high-dose 
group.  In  addition,  the  end  of  infusion  time  point  for  gemcitabine  was  not  collected;  therefore,  a 
relevant  part  of  the  AUC  estimate  was  not  calculated.  AUC0-inf  was  used  to  assess  the  effect  of 
bevacizumab  on  the  exposure  of  gemcitabine  in  the  presence  of  cisplatin.  In  general,  AUC0-inf  results 
showed  that  on  Day  1,  on  average,  gemcitabine  exposure  was  lower  than  on  Day  8.  Gemcitabine 
exposure on Day 8 was slightly higher compared to Day 1. The difference in gemcitabine exposure was 
less pronounced between the two active treatment groups and placebo on Day 8 compared to Day 1. 
High  inter-  and  intra-  patient  variability,  as  well  as  limited  sampling,  precludes  conclusions  for  a  PK-
DDI interaction of bevacizumab on gemcitabine pharmacokinetics.   
The  population  PK  results  from  BO17704  and  BO17706  were  comparable  to  the  pharmacokinetics  of 
patients  treated  with  single-agent  bevacizumab  and  of  patients  treated  with  bevacizumab  co-
administered  with  chemotherapies,  suggesting  that  anti-cancer  agents,  including  carboplatin  and 
gemcitabine, do not alter bevacizumab pharmacokinetics when co-administered with bevacizumab.

Page 5/49
 
 
 
 
Overall,  the  cumulative  PK-DDI  data  to  date  for  bevacizumab  given  in  combination  with  various 
chemotherapy  agents  across  tumour  types  do  not  suggest  a  potential  for  a  PK-DDI  between 
bevacizumab  and  chemotherapy  agents.  In  addition,  the  lack  of  PK-DDI  of  sufficient  magnitude  does 
not  necessitate  dose  modifications  for  the  chemotherapeutics  and  anti-cancer  agents  used  in 
combination with bevacizumab.  
2.4 Clinical Efficacy  
2.4.1. Dose-response study 
No dose-response study was performed in the proposed indication.  
The dose of Bv of 15 mg/kg every 21 days (q3w), which is equivalent to a dose of 5 mg/kg/week, is 
the most commonly used dose of Bv that has been shown to be effective in clinical trials across 
multiple tumour types. In ovarian cancer, this dose was also studied in the two single-arm Phase II 
studies in ovarian cancer, which demonstrated strong activity of Bv as a single agent and was thus the 
dose chosen for the subsequent frontline Phase III trial GOG-0218 in combination with carboplatin and 
paclitaxel as well as for Study AVF4095g in the recurrent setting. The second front-line Study BO17707 
(ICON7) used a lower Bv dose of 7.5 mg/kg q3w (equivalent to 2.5 mg/kg/week), which has been 
used in trials in other solid tumours although there were no clinical data in ovarian cancer with use of 
this lower dose. Thus, given the positive results in Phase II and III studies in patients with ovarian 
cancer with the 5-mg/kg/week dose, including the greater magnitude of benefit seen in Study GOG-
0218 compared with Study BO17707 accompanied by an equivalent safety profile, the MAH supports 
the use of the 5-mg/kg/week dose in this disease. 
The selection of the chemotherapy regimen in combination with Bv for Study AVF4095g was based on 
the results of Study AGO-OVAR, in which patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent disease received 
gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 and carboplatin AUC (area under the curve) 4 mg/mL/min 
on Day 1 of each cycle. In that study, treatment cycles were repeated q3w for six cycles and for up to 
10 cycles at the investigator’s discretion. The results of Study AGO-OVAR showed an improvement in 
response rate and PFS with the combination of CG compared with single-agent carboplatin. 
Gemcitabine in combination with carboplatin was approved in the United States and Europe for use in 
recurrent ovarian cancer on the basis of these data prior to the design and initiation of Study 
AVF4095g. 
2.4.2. Main study  
Study AVF4095g (OCEANS) 
Study  AVF4095g  was  a  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  multicenter  Phase III  trial 
comparing treatment with carboplatin + gemcitabine (CG) plus concurrent and extended bevacizumab 
(Bv)  versus  carboplatin + gemcitabine plus concurrent  and  extended  placebo  (Pl)  in  women  with 
recurrent platinum-sensitive EOC, FTC, or PPC.

Treatments 
An overview of the design of Study AVF4095g is shown in Figure 1. 
Figure 1. Design of Study AVF4095g  
Patients were randomized to receive treatment with carboplatin (area under the curve [AUC] 4, Day 1, 
every  21  days  [q3w])  and  gemcitabine  (1000 mg/m2,  Day  1,  Day  8,  q3w)  plus  concomitant  and 
extended bevacizumab (15 mg/kg Day 1, q3w) or carboplatin and gemcitabine (CG) plus concomitant 
and extended placebo. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/655681/2012  
Page 7/49
 
 
 
 
 
 
15  mg/kg  of  bevacizumab/placebo  was  administered  by  intravenous  (IV)  infusion  on  the  first  day  of 
Cycle 1, every 3 weeks (21-day cycle). Patients received 6 (up to 10) cycles  of CG concurrently with 
Bv or Pl. The patients then continued with single-agent Bv or Pl until PD or unacceptable toxicity. 
Unblinding to study treatment was allowed at the time of documented PD, or after the final analysis of 
progression free survival (PFS). Patients who were randomised to treatment with bevacizumab and 
who were still receiving study drug at the time of study unblinding were offered the opportunity to 
enter an open-label bevacizumab phase. Bevacizumab was administered at the same dose and 
schedule in the open-label phase as in the blinded phase of the study. Open-label bevacizumab was 
continued until disease progression (PD), unacceptable toxicity, investigator decision, withdrawal of 
consent, or death, whichever occurred first. 
Reduction in the dose of bevacizumab or placebo was not allowed in this study.  
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  (in  terms  of  PFS)  of  combining 
bevacizumab  with  carboplatin  and  gemcitabine  compared  with  carboplatin  and  gemcitabine  with 
placebo  in  patients  with  platinum-sensitive,  recurrent  ovarian,  primary  peritoneal,  or  fallopian  tube 
cancer.  
Secondary  objectives  included  evaluation  of  objective  response  rate  (ORR),  duration  of  response, 
overall survival (OS) and safety profile of bevacizumab in combination with CG. 
Exploratory objectives were to evaluate the efficacy of bevacizumab as measured by PFS and objective 
response as determined by the Independent Review Committee (IRC), according to modified RECIST, 
to characterize cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) tumour marker levels and their relation to tumour 
response and treatment as measured by modified RECIST and to assess the effect of bevacizumab on 
ascites. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint of study AVF4095g was investigator-determined PFS defined as the time 
from randomization to PD based on investigator determination or death due to any cause. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Objective  response  was  defined  as  the  occurrence  of  a  complete  response  (CR)  or  partial  response 
(PR), with use of modified RECIST, confirmed by a repeat assessment performed ≥ 4 weeks after the 
criteria for response were first met.  
The duration of objective response was defined as the time from the initial CR or PR until documented 
PD or death. 
OS was defined as the time from randomization until death by any cause in the ITT population. 
Sample size 
The sample size was calculated on the basis of the following assumptions: 
-80% power to reject the null hypothesis 
-Two-sided test at α = 0.05 
-An HR of 0.73 
-Median PFS in the control group of 8.6 months. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/655681/2012  
Page 8/49
 
 
 
 
Based of these assumptions, a total of 317 PFS events would need to be observed at the time of the 
final PFS analysis. It was estimated that a total of 480 patients would be required to achieve this goal 
in an acceptable time frame based an enrolment rate of 20 patients per month, a ramp-up period of 
approximately 3 months, and an exponential drop-out rate of 0.019575. Complete enrolment was 
expected to occur after approximately 2.5 years, and full information for the primary endpoint was 
expected approximately 3.5 years after study initiation. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized 1:1 to CG + Bv or CG + Pl and were stratified by platinum-sensitive disease 
(recurrence  6–12  months  from  last  platinum-based  treatment  vs.  recurrence  > 12 months  from  last 
platinum-based  treatment)  and  whether  they  had  undergone  cytoreductive  surgery  for  recurrent 
disease (yes, no).  
Blinding (masking) 
The study was double-blind. 
Statistical methods 
All  efficacy  analyses  were  performed  when  approximately  317  PFS  events  were  observed  (full  PFS 
information  as  specified  by  the  protocol).  An  interim  futility  analysis  was  performed  for  the  primary 
endpoint  of 
investigator-determined  PFS  at  approximately  50%  of  total 
information  (i.e., 
approximately 160 events). 
The  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  the  comparison  of  investigator-determined  PFS  between  the  two 
treatment arms (GC + Bv vs. GC + Pl) through the use of a two-sided stratified log-rank test. Results 
from an unstratified log-rank test are also provided. The overall Type I error rate for the two-sided test 
for  the  primary  endpoint  of  PFS  was  controlled  at  α = 0.05.  Kaplan-Meier  methodology  was  used  to 
estimate the PFS curves and median times in the treatment arms. A Cox regression model was used to 
estimate the stratified and unstratified hazard ratio (HR). 
Data for patients who did not have investigator-determined PD and who had not died at the time of the 
clinical cut-off were censored at the time of the last tumour assessment. If no tumour assessments were 
performed after the baseline visit, PFS was censored at the date of randomization plus 1 day. PFS data 
for patients receiving non–protocol-specified antineoplastic therapy (NPT) prior to documented PD were 
also censored at the time of the last tumour assessment prior to therapy initiation. 
Exploratory and Sensitivity Analyses 
The following exploratory and sensitivity analyses of PFS were performed: 
 
 
 
 
-Investigator-determined PFS analysis not censored for NPT. 
-IRCdetermined analyses of PFS. 
-Discontinuation due to toxicity impact analyses on PFS.  
-Worst-case  PFS  analysis  accounting  for  missing  data:  Two  worst-case  analyses  were 
performed  in  which  patients  with  two  or  more  missing  tumour  assessments  prior  to  the  data  cut-off 
were assumed to have progressed on the date of the first missed assessment. 
 
 
-IRC-determined and investigator-determined concordance analyses. 
-Impact of demographic and baseline characteristics on the primary endpoint of PFS. 
In addition, an analysis of IRC-determined ORR and duration of OR was also performed.

The  primary  efficacy  analysis  population  was  the  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  population,  defined  as  all 
patients  randomized  to  protocol  treatment,  irrespective  of  whether  the  assigned  treatment  was 
actually received. For all efficacy analyses, patients were grouped according to the treatment assigned 
at randomization.  
The  primary  safety  population  consisted  of  all  randomized  patients  who  received  at  least  one  full  or 
partial  dose  of  any  component  of  protocol  treatment.  For  safety  analyses,  patients  were  grouped 
according to whether any full or partial dose of bevacizumab was received.

cut-off date was 17 September 2010 for the PFS, ORR analysis and for the OS interim analysis. 
Conduct of the study 
The protocol for Study AVF4095g was finalized on 21 November 2006 and was subsequently amended 
five times.  
The first amendment (22 May 2007) was to allow the unblinding of protocol treatment at PD instead of 
at week 51. 
The  second  amendment  (8  April  2008)  was  mainly  to  change  the  primary  endpoint  of  PFS  to  be 
investigator-determined  (rather  than  IRC−determined)  PFS,  to  update  the  exploratory  objectives  to 
include IRC-determined PFS, objective response, and duration of response, to increase the sample size 
from  200  patients  to  450  patients  to  power  the  study  as  a  Phase  III  trial,  to  exclude  anti-neoplastic 
hormone therapy and to change the exclusion criteria regarding other malignancies. 
The  third  amendment  (15  October  2008)  was  mainly  to  add  clarification  that  unblinding  for  clinical 
progression  could  not  be  based  on  CA125  levels  alone.  Clinical  progression  had  to  be  supported  with 
associated signs and symptoms. 
The fourth amendment (11 August 2009) was to add a futility analysis for the primary endpoint and to 
increase  the  sample  size  to  480  patients  as  fewer  patients  progressed  than  expected.  Consequently, 
the enrolment period was increased to 2.5 years. 
The  fifth  amendment  (22  December  2010)  was  to  allow  patients  randomized  to  the  bevacizumab-
containing arm to continue to receive bevacizumab after unblinding if study results were positive.

The  generalizability  of  the  observed  benefit  of  adding  bevacizumab  to  CG  therapy  on  the  primary 
parameter  of  investigator-determined  PFS  was  investigated  by  estimating  the  treatment  effect  in 
predefined  subgroups.  Subgroups  and  prognostic  factors  for  assessing  the  treatment  effect  on  PFS 
included  the  randomization  stratification  variables  (time  to  recurrence  since  the  last  platinum-based 
therapy  and  occurrence  of  cytoreductive  surgery  for  recurrent  disease),  age,  race,  baseline  ECOG 
performance status, histopathological cell type, SLD of target lesions at baseline, prior biologic therapy, 
prior hormonal therapy, and prior myeloablative therapy. 
Based on the results of all the subgroup analyses the HRs ranging from 0.41 - 0.68.

2.2.3 Discussion on clinical efficacy 
This application concerns the use of bevacizumab in patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian 
cancer. It is based on a single pivotal trial, AVF4095g (OCEANS), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled,  multicenter  Phase III  trial  comparing  treatment  with  carboplatin + gemcitabine (CG)  plus 
concurrent  and  extended  bevacizumab  (Bv)  versus  carboplatin + gemcitabine plus concurrent  and 
extended placebo (Pl) in women with recurrent platinum-sensitive EOC, FTC, or PPC. 
Design  and conduct of clinical studies 
The  AGO-OVAR  is  the  reference  study  for  the  carboplatin-gemcitabine  backbone  as  used  in  the 
OCEANS  trial  and  referenced  to  in  most  international  guidelines,  including  ESMO  Clinical  Practice 
Guidelines.  In  the  AGO-OVAR  study  patients  in  the  experimental  arm  received  gemcitabine  1,000 
mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 and carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) 4 mg/mL/min on day 1. Patients 
in the control arm received carboplatin AUC 5 on day 1, based on the Calvert formula (Phisterer J et al. 
JCO 2006; 24(29): 4699-4707.

In study AVF4095g, only patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent disease who had not received prior 
therapy with bevacizumab or prior treatment with other VEGF inhibitors or VEGF receptor–targeted 
agent previously, and only those who experienced recurrence for the first time were eligible. The 
indication proposed by the MAH has been revised to reflect this target population and the section 5.1 of 
the SmPC has been updated to include the above inclusion criteria of study AVF4095g.  
Platinum  sensitivity  is  commonly  defined  as  a  patient  who  has  had  a  relapse    6  months  after  initial 
platinum  chemotherapy.  There  was  no  specific  requirement  for  documented  response  to  front-line 
therapy for patients to be considered eligible.  
There  were  9  weeks  between  tumour  assessments.  9-week  intervals  have  precedence  in  ovarian 
cancer  and  are  considered  convenient  in  relation  to  patient  burden  and  the  6-10  cycles  of 
chemotherapy given every 3 weeks. Due to the relatively long time to progression in ovarian cancer, 
the  possible  impact  of  a  9-week  interval  between  tumour  assessments  on  the  estimate  of  PFS  is 
considered  minimal.  Tumour  assessments  were  performed  by  modified  RECIST,  which  is  considered 
acceptable.  However,  progression  could  also  be  determined  clinically,  but  not  based  on  CA-125 
increase  alone.  Overall,  4  patients  in  the  Bv  arm  and  2  patients  in  the  Pl  arm  had  clinical  disease 
progression during the study.  
CA125  rises  and  radiographic  progressions  are  not  always  concordant  in  patients  treated  with 
bevacizumab.  According  to  the  protocol,  an  increase  in  CA-125  alone  was  not  sufficient  as  basis  for 
determining  PD.  In  study  AVF4095g  13%  of  patients  in  both  treatment  arms  had  a  CA125  elevation 
without modified RECIST defined progression. As the proportion was similar across treatment arms, no 
influence  on  the  PFS  result  is  foreseen.  This  was  confirmed  in  a  sensitivity  analysis  in  which  CA125 
progressions were also counted as events.  
The date of PD was based on the date of initial documentation rather than the time of confirmed PD for 
both investigator and IRC assessments. No confirmation of PD was required. Unfortunately, scans were 
not taken until both investigator and IRC decided on progressive disease for a patient. In 49 patients 
(20.2%)  in  the  Bv  arm  and  56  patients  (23.1%)  in  the  Pl  arm,  the  investigator  determined  PD  while 
the IRC did not. In these cases, the patients discontinued treatment, and no more scans were taken. 
However,  the  overall  concordance  for  PD  status  between  investigators  and  IRC  was  high  and  not 
indicative of a systematic bias in investigators’ assessments.  
The MAH has provided adequate information about the number of patients included in the analyses of 
PFS, the number of patients censored from the analyses and the reason for censoring of data.   
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The  major  reason  for  withdrawing  from  treatment  was  development  of  PD:  66.1%  (placebo  arm)  vs. 
43.0% (bevacizumab arm).   
The HR for the primary stratified PFS analysis (INV assessed and censored for NPT) was 0.48 (95% CI: 
0.388,  0.605;  p  <  0.0001)  in  favour  of  the  bevacizumab-containing  arm,  with  a  median  PFS  of  8.4 
months in the placebo arm vs. 12.4 months in the bevacizumab arms. A similar result was obtained in 
the unstratified analysis (HR = 0.492; 95% CI: 0.396, 0.613). The Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated 
an early separation after two months.  In contrast, to what was observed in the front-line setting, the 
curves stay separate, also in the last parts of the curves. The primary PFS analysis was the final (70% 
of events were reported). 
A sensitivity analysis not censoring for NPT showed a very similar result (HR = 0.524; 95% CI: 0.425, 
0.645).  Reassuringly,  the  MAH  has  also  performed  a  “worst-case  analysis”  as  requested  in  which  all 
patients with NPT use were counted as events. In this very conservative analysis, the HR of PFS was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/655681/2012  
Page 23/49
 
 
 
 
0.529  (95%  CI:  0.430,  0-652).  It  is  therefore  acknowledged  that  censoring  for  NPT  was  not  a 
significant factor in the PFS analysis. 
A  number  of  pre-specified  sensitivity  analyses  have  also  been  performed  that  overall  confirm  the 
robustness  of  the  primary  PFS  analysis.  In  these  sensitivity  analyses,  the  magnitude  of  the  effect  on 
PFS following treatment with bevacizumab compared to placebo in terms of HR ranged from 0.45 (IRC 
determined PFS: censored for NPT) to 0.67 (INV determined PFS: Worst Case Analysis Accounting for 
Missing Data: analysis imputing PD in the bevacizumab and placebo arms). The gain in PFS in favour of 
therapy  with  bevacizumab  ranged  from  2.3  months  (INV  determined  PFS:  Worst  Case  Analysis 
Accounting for Missing Data: analysis imputing PD in the bevacizumab arm only) to 4.1 months (INV 
determined PFS: Discontinuation Due to Toxicity). 
The  concordance  rate  between  INV  and  IRC-based  determination  of  progression  was  relatively  high: 
73.2% in the placebo arm vs. 75.2% in the bevacizumab arm. When comparing the dates of PD/death 
or  censoring  based  as  determined  by  INV  and  IRC,  respectively,  there  was  an  absolute  difference  in 
PFS dates of ≤ 9 weeks (one tumour assessment interval) in the majority of patients (85%). Overall, 
the consistency between the IRC- and INV- based results indicates that investigators’ assessments of 
PFS were not biased.   
Consistent  results  were  found  in  the  pre-specified  subgroup  analysis  according  to  prognostic  factors/ 
stratification  factors.  A  benefit  in  favour  of  the  bevacizumab  -containing  arm  was  observed  in  all 
subgroups investigated. 
ORR  results (secondary  endpoint)  were  also in  favour  of  the  bevacizumab-containg  treatment  arm. A 
statistical  significantly  higher  ORR  of  78.5%  (INV-determined)  was  observed  in  patients  treated  with 
bevacizumab compared with 57.4% in the placebo arm resulting in an absolute difference of 21.1% (p 
<0.0001) which is remarkable. The majority of responses were PRs. In responding patients the median 
duration of OR was also longer in the bevacizumab arm (10.4 months) compared to the placebo arm 
(7.4 months) (non-randomised subset). The overall result of the exploratory analysis of ORR based on 
IRC assessment is in accordance with the INV analysis; there was a statistically significant difference of 
21.1%  in  ORR  between  the  treatment  arms  in  favour  of  treatment  with  bevacizumab.  There  was  a 
large  difference  in  the  proportion  of  patients  with  CR  assessed  by  the  investigators  and  the  IRC: 
according  to  the  investigator  assessment  9.1%  and  17.4%  of  the  patients  in  the  placebo  and 
bevacizumab arms, respectively, achieved CR. According to the IRC assessments the proportions were 
1.2% and 0.8%. This discrepancy was caused by differences in the criteria used for assessments of the 
tumour size in the study protocol and IRF charter, respectively. It is acknowledged, however, that the 
overall results from the investigator-based and IRC-based analyses of ORR were comparable. 
At  the  most  recent  OS  analysis  (3rd  update,  cut-off  date:  30  March  2012)  59%  of  patients  had  died 
overall  (142  (58.7%)  in  the  placebo  arm  and  144  (59.5%)  in  the  bevacizumab  arm).  The  number  of 
deaths was comparable between treatment arms. The median OS was 33.7 months in the placebo arm 
compared to 33.4 months in the bevacizumab arm. The HR for OS was 0.964 (95% CI: 0.764, 1.216) 
(unstratified analysis). The K-M curves were overlapping from 24 months and onwards.  
The vast majority of deaths were attributed to disease progression in both treatment arms (only 0.4% 
of  deaths  in  the  placebo  arm  compared  to  1.2%  in  the  Bv  arm  were  caused  by  adverse  events)  so 
there is no indication of significantly increased toxicity-related deaths in the Bv-containing arm.   
The Applicant has also analysed the types of progressions as reported by Investigators. There was no 
indication  that  Bv  should  have  promoted  new  lesions  as  a  very  similar  pattern  was  observed  across 
treatment  arms  in  terms  of  types  of  first  PD  event  (1/3  of  patients  had  new  lesions  only  in  both 
treatment  arms,  1/3  both  new  lesions  and  progression  of  exiting  lesions,  1/3  progression  of  existing 
lesions only).

EMA/CHMP/655681/2012  
Page 24/49
 
 
 
 
In  summary,  no  difference  was  seen  for  OS  between  treatment  arms  in  the  updated  3rd  interim  OS 
analysis. The final OS analysis is awaited in Q4 2013 (73% of events projected) and the  MAH should 
submit these results as an obligation. 
The  MAH  has  performed  a  number  of  additional  analyses  based  on  data  from  the  3rd  interim  OS 
analysis  (date  of  data  cut-off:  30  March  2012).  No significant  detriment  was  observed  in  the  Bv  arm 
compared to the Pl arm in any of the subgroups.  
Based  on  the  most  recent  OS  analysis,  it  can  be  concluded  that  BV  treatment  does  not  have  a 
detrimental effect on OS in the current setting. The median follow-up time is longer than the median 
OS estimate, and the KM curves stay separated at the time intervals when the degree of censoring is 
minimal.  
Given the magnitude of the estimated improvement in PFS following therapy an OS benefit could have 
been expected. However, it is difficult to demonstrate transfer of PFS benefit into increased OS when 
post-progression  survival  is  long  also  because  long  SPP  (post-progression  survival)  allows  for  use  of 
multiple lines of post-progression therapies. In the OCEAN study app. 85-89% of the patients received 
non-protocol specified anti-cancer therapies, of these app. 40% in the Pl arm and 22% in the Bv arm 
received Bv after progression. It is acknowledged that any effect on OS associated to the improvement 
in PFS of 4 months may be difficult to observe due to the relatively long post-progression survival, and 
also    due  to  post-progression  therapy  that  may  have  confounded  the  OS  results.  Indeed,  a  more 
positive OS trend in favour of Bv was actually observed in the front-line setting where fewer placebo-
treated  patients  received  bevacizumab  as  later  therapy.  It  is  the  most  likely  explanation,  but  no 
definitive  answer  can  be  given  to  this  question.  Of  note,  40%  crossover  from  the  Pl  arm  is  not 
considered  a  high  number,  and  since  phase  II  studies  have  indicated  effect  of  single  agent  Bv  in 
ovarian cancer, a more convincing OS result would have been expected if the impact of Bv on OS was 
to  be  substantial.  Nevertheless,  the  OS  data  are  sufficiently  mature  and  allow  ruling  out  a  significant 
detriment in terms of OS, which supports the clinical relevance of the observed difference in terms of 
PFS. This will be further confirmed with the final OS analysis although major changes are not expected, 
since  the  median  follow-up  time  is  longer  than  the  median  OS  estimate,  and  the  KM  curves  stay 
separated at the time intervals when the degree of censoring is minimal. 
The  discrepancy  between  PFS  and  OS  results  has  been  observed  before  in  relation  to  bevacizumab 
therapy. Thus, a concern has been raised that PFS results might have been overestimated, analogous 
(but much less pronounced) to what was seen in glioblastoma. Although there seemed to be no ideal 
way  to  address  this  uncertainty,  it  has  been  suggested  that  longitudinal  CA125  data  might  be 
informative despite reports of interference with bevacizumab. 
CA-125  changes  may  not  correspond  to  imaging  responses  in  ovarian  cancer  patients  receiving 
bevacizumab as reported by Azad et al. (Cancer 2008; 112: 1726-32) and Randall et al. Gynecol Oncol 
2012;  124:  563-8).  An  interaction  between  bevacizumab  and  CA-125  has  been  described  based  on 
concordance  rates  of  CA125  defined  progressions  and  modified  RECIST  defined  progressions  in  study 
AVF4095g.  
The MAH has clarified the following points:   
1)  If  PFS  results  had  been  overestimated,  many  patients  would  have  discontinued  therapy  based  on 
clinical signs or symptoms of disease progression which was not the case.   
2)  Depicting  the  requested  longitudinal  CA-125  levels  for  the  entire  study  population  would  be 
challenging  and  difficult  to  interpret  as  criteria  for  defining  tumour  responses/progressions  are  based 
on  relative  CA-125  values.  Therefore,  alternative  analyses  have  been  provided  which  is  considered 
acceptable.   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/655681/2012  
Page 25/49
 
 
 
 
3)  In  general,  CA-125  levels  correlate  well  with  both  responses  and  progressions  as  determined  by 
modified RECIST in the pivotal study AVF4095g. Actually, CA-125 responses occurred at a higher rate 
than modified RECIST-based responses why the latter is considered a more conservative estimate.             
4) Concordance rates between CA125-defined responses and modified RECIST defined responses were 
also high (80.8% in the placebo arm and 81.1% in the bevacizumab arm, respectively).  
5)  In  addition,  the  time  from  randomization  to  CA-125  response  and  from  randomization  to  modified 
RECIST-defined response was very similar in both treatment arms.    
6) When PFS was estimated based on CA-125 levels, the observed PFS benefit was similar to what was 
found in the primary analysis.  
7)  Prior  concerns  related  to  the  imaging  of  responses  in  glioblastoma  do  not  apply  to  ovarian  cancer 
due to different tumour characteristics and modalities of imaging.  
In  conclusion,  the  observed  PFS  benefit  associated  with  bevacizumab  as  determined  per  modified 
RECIST  in  recurrent  ovarian  cancer  is  considered  reliable,  reflecting  a  true  tumour  response.  The 
possible  explanations  for  the  apparent  lack  of  improvement  in  OS  despite  a  clear  PFS  benefit  have 
been adequately addressed by the MAH and accepted as a reasonable interpretation of study data. 
Material  for  biomarker  analyses  were  not  collected.  Although  specific  biomarkers  for  Avastin  may  not 
have been identified at the time of the design of study AVF4095g, the potential for future analyses to 
be  performed  on  such  material  should  have  been  acknowledged.  Although  samples  for  exploratory 
biomarkers were collected in the two phase 3 front-line ovarian cancer studies, markers for recurrent 
disease may differ from those of interest in the front-line setting. 
Finally, it is also worth discussing when to introduce bevacizumab in the treatment of ovarian cancer. 
Should it be given in the front-line or recurrent setting? Based on the presented results, it seems that 
either  is  possible  which  leaves  the  treating  physicians/patients  with  some  choices.  Factors  to  be 
considered  are  the  aggressiveness  of  the  disease,  the  performance  status  of  the  patient,  the  toxicity 
profile  and  physician/patient  preferences.  Actually,  the  data  seem  to  indicate  that  patients  with  the 
worst prognostic factors might actually gain the largest benefit from this treatment. It will eventually 
be  a  decision  for  the  treating  physician  (in  consultation  with  the  patient)  to  decide  if  and  when  to 
introduce bevacizumab into the treatment of ovarian cancer.  
Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The  single  pivotal  study  AVF4095  has  demonstrated  that  bevacizumab  in  combination  with 
carboplatin+gemcitabine for 6 cycles (up to 10 cycles) followed by bevacizumab as single-agent until 
PD resulted in a 52% reduction in the risk of progression or death and an absolute gain in median PFS 
of about 4 months in women with their first recurrence of platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer who had 
not  previously  been  exposed  to  bevacizumab  or  other  anti-angiogenesis  inhibitors.  This  result  is 
considered  clinically  relevant  and  unprecedented  in  the  recurrent  setting.  A  number  of  sensitivity 
analyses have confirmed the robustness of the result that was also confirmed in all subgroup analyses.  
The  result  was  supported  by  a  marked  increase  in  ORR.  There  was  no  significant  difference  in  OS 
between treatment arms. At the latest 3rd OS updated analysis, where 59% of patients had died, there 
was no indication of a detrimental effect on OS. The extensive use of later lines of therapy may have 
confounded OS results.

2.3 Clinical Safety aspects  
The  primary  safety  analysis  (cut  off  date  17  September  201)  was  performed  on  the  safety-evaluable 
population  (N = 480),  which  was  defined  as  all  patients  who  received  any  partial  or  full  dose  of 
protocol treatment: carboplatin, gemcitabine, bevacizumab, or placebo.  
In  addition, post-marketing  safety  information  up to  25  February  2011  (the  cut  off  date  used  for  the 
8th Periodic Safety Update Report) is provided. 
An  adverse  event  (AE)  was  defined  as  any  unfavourable  and  unintended  sign,  symptom,  or  disease 
temporally associated with the use of an investigational (medicinal) product or other protocol-imposed 
intervention,  regardless  of  attribution.   All  AEs  reported  in  the study  were  graded  by  the  investigator 
for  severity  according  to  the  National  Cancer  Institute  Common  Toxicity  Criteria  for  Adverse  Events 
(NCI CTCAE), Version 3.0. 
Patients  were  evaluated  for  all  AEs  and  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  at  each study  visit  for  the 
duration  of  their  participation  in  the  study  and  up  to  30 days  after  discontinuation  from  study 
treatment.    Patients  who  discontinued  during  the  treatment phase  of  the  study  for  any  reason  were 
evaluated  for  safety  approximately  30 days  (+ 10 days)  after  discontinuation  of  treatment.    Patients 
continuing  in  the  open-label  Bv  phase  after  the  study  was  unblinded  were  also  followed  with  AE 
collection up to approximately 30 days (+ 10 days) after their last dose of bevacizumab. 
After  30  days  following  the  last  protocol  treatment,  only  SAEs  that  were  attributed  to  prior  protocol 
treatment were reported. Adverse events were followed to resolution, or until the investigator assessed 
them as stable or the patient was lost to follow-up; thus, information regarding AE resolution was not 
complete for all AEs.

Estimated dose intensity (%) is the actual dose received divided by the intended dose × 100. 
For  carboplatin,  the  median  number  of  cycles  was  6  in  both  arms.  The  percentage  of  patients  who 
received  7–10  cycles  was  higher  in  the  placebo  arm  (40.3%)  than  in  the  bevacizumab arm  (33.3%). 
The median dose intensity was comparable between two treatment arms. 
For  gemcitabine,  patients  received  a  median  number  of  6  cycles  in  both  arms.  A  slightly  higher 
percentage  of  patients  received  7–10  cycles  in  the  placebo  arm  (45.5%)  compared  with  that  in  the 
bevacizumab arm (41.3%). The median dose intensity was similar across both treatment arms. 
The number of study drug cycles was higher in the bevacizumab arm (median, 12 cycles; range, 1–43 
cycles)  than  in  the  placebo  arm  (median,  10  cycles;  range,  1–36  cycles).  The  median  duration  of

treatment  for  patients  in  the  bevacizumab  arm  was  correspondingly  higher  at  37.3  weeks,  compared 
with 32.1 weeks for patients in the placebo arm.  
Adverse events 
All patients in both treatment arms experienced one or more AE of any grade. For patients who 
received bevacizumab in Study AVF4095g, the most frequently reported AEs were fatigue (81.4%), 
nausea (71.7%), neutropenia (68.8%), thrombocytopenia (57.9%), epistaxis (54.3%), and anaemia 
(52.6%). The majority of these were Grade 1 events, with the exception of thrombocytopenia and 
neutropenia, of which the majority were Grade  ≥ 3. The overall safety results of Study AVF4095g are

Adverse events of NCI CTCAR Grades 3-5 
In the bevacizumab arm, 89.5% of patients experienced an AE of Grades 3–5 (NCI -CTCAE) severity in 
the bevacizumab arm comparing to 82.4% in the placebo arm. The grade 3 and grade 4 AEs in the 
CG + Pl arm (N=233) were 98 (42.1%) and 93 (39.9%), respectively. In the CG + Bv (n = 247) arm, 
the incidence of grade 3 and grade 4 AEs were 105 (42.5%) and 115 (46.6%), respectively. The most 
frequently reported AEs of Grade ≥ 3 were: neutropenia (51.1% Pl, 51.4 % Bv), thrombocytopenia 
(33.9% Pl, 40.1% Bv), anaemia (18.9% Pl, 15.8% Bv), and hypertension (0.4% Pl, 16.2% Bv). 
Grade 3–5 AEs for which the incidence was ≥ 2% higher in the bevacizumab arm than in the placebo 
arm were thrombocytopenia, nausea, fatigue, headache, proteinuria, dyspnoea, epistaxis, and 
hypertension. One treatment-emergent death (grade 5 AE) was reported in each of the two treatment 
arms.

Adverse events of special interest 
  Arterial thromboembolic events (ATE) 
Arterial  thromboembolic  events  of  any  grade  were  reported  in  a  higher  percentage  of  bevacizumab-
treated patients (2.8%) than patients who received placebo (0.9%); the majority of these were Grade 
3  events  (Pl  0%  vs.  Bv  2.0%).    In  the  placebo  arm,  two  patients  experienced  a  Grade  4 
cerebrovascular  accident  and  cerebral  ischemia,  respectively.  In  addition  to  the  Grade  4  cerebral 
ischemia, the same patient (29634) also experienced a fatal myocardial infarction. The seven ATEs in 
the bevacizumab arm varied in nature:  One bevacizumab-treated patient had a myocardial infarction 
(Grade  4),  2 patients  experienced  a  transient  ischemic  attack  (Grade  3),  1  patient  had  an  arterial 
thrombus (Grade 3), 1 patient had an arterial occlusion (Grade 3), and 2 patients had arterial emboli 
(Grade 2 and Grade 3).  Because of coding conventions, one event reported as “thrombosis/embolism 
(vascular access-related)” was categorized as an ATE, despite being venous in nature. 
  Bleeding 
A  total  of  3 patients  experienced  CNS  bleeding  of  any  grade:    1  patient in  the  placebo arm  (Grade  1 
cerebral haemorrhage and Grade 1 subarachnoid haemorrhage and 2 patients in the bevacizumab arm 
(fatal intracranial haemorrhage and Grade 4 hemorrhagic stroke. 
 The incidence of non-CNS bleeding events of any grade was higher in the bevacizumab arm (63.2%) 
compared with the Pl arm (27.0%); the majority of these were Grade 1 and 2 events (Pl 26.2% vs. Bv 
57.5%), particularly Grade 1 epistaxis (Pl 13.3% vs. Bv 41.3%). 
Grade 3 non-CNS bleeding was reported in a higher percentage of bevacizumab-treated patients (5.7%) 
compared with patients who received Pl (0.9%).  The majority of these Grade 3 events were epistaxis 
(Pl 0.4% vs. Bv 4.9%).  Other Grade 3 non-CNS bleeding events occurred in no more than 1 patient 
and included GI haemorrhage, haematuria, soft tissue haemorrhage, and upper GI haemorrhage.  No 
Grade 4 or Grade 5 non-CNS bleeding events were reported.   
  Gastrointestinal (GI) perforation 
No  patient  in  the  study  reported  a  treatment-emergent  GI  perforation  within  the  30-day  safety 
reporting  period.    However,  two  patients,  both  in  the  bevacizumab  arm,  experienced  GI  perforations 
after the 30-day post-treatment AE reporting period: 
 
One  patient  received  her  last  dose  of  bevacizumab  on  14  April  2010  (Cycle  39).    She  was 
hospitalized with a Grade 4 event of intestinal perforation on 21 June 2010, 69 days after her last dose 
of  bevacizumab.    The  AE  resolved  on  6 July  2010.    The  investigator  assessed  that  the  event  was 
caused by bevacizumab or the disease under study.  The patient had no history of inflammatory bowel 
disease or diverticulitis.  She discontinued study treatment on 14 April 2010 because of PD.  
 
The second patient received her last dose of bevacizumab on 28 January 2010 (Cycle 34). She 
experienced  a  Grade  4  gastric  ulcer  perforation  on  6 April  2010,  69  days  after  her  last  bevacizumab 
treatment; the AE resolved on 15 April 2010.  The investigator assessed that the event was caused by 
bevacizumab or concurrent illness and concomitant medications.  The patient had a history of irritable 
bowel  syndrome  and  diverticulitis.    She  discontinued  study  treatment  following  an  episode  of  small 
bowel obstruction on 5 March 2010. 
 
Fistula and Abscess 
Fistulas/abscesses were reported in 1 patient in the Pl arm (Grade 1 anal fistula) and 4 patients in the 
bevacizumab  arm  (Grade  2  perirectal  abscess;  Grade  3  female  genital  tract  fistula,  Grade  3  pelvic 
abscess, and Grade 3 rectal abscess).  No Grade 4 or Grade 5 fistulas/abscesses were reported.

 
Hypertension 
The overall incidence of all grade hypertension was 42.1% in the bevacizumab arm and 8.6 % in the 
placebo  arm.    The  median  time  to  onset  of  hypertension  was  15.5  months  in  the  bevacizumab  arm 
(not  reached  for  the  placebo  arm).    During  the  AE  reporting  period,  all  grade  hypertension  was 
reported as resolved in 14 (70.0%) of the 20 patients in the placebo arm and in 57 (54.8%) of the 104 
patients in the bevacizumab arm.  
Hypertension Grade ≥ 3 was reported in a higher percentage of bevacizumab-treated patients (17.4%) 
than in patients who received placebo (0.4%).  Two bevacizumab-treated patients experienced Grade 
4 hypertension. 
In  patients  with  Grade  ≥ 3  hypertension,  the  median  time  to  onset  of  hypertension  was  not  reached 
for both arms.  Among the patients who developed Grade ≥ 3 hypertension, the AE resolved in the one 
patient  in  the  Pl  arm  and  in  24  (56%)  of  43  patients  in  the  bevacizumab  arm.    A  total  of  9  of  43 
patients with Grade ≥ 3 hypertension discontinued bevacizumab. 
 
Left ventricular dysfunction/Congestive heart failure (CHF) 
Overall,  6  bevacizumab-treated  patients  (2.4%)  and  two patients  in  the  placebo  arm  (0.9%) 
experienced  CHF  events.    In  the  bevacizumab  arm,  three  of  these  were  Grade ≤ 2  events,  two  were 
Grade 3, and one was a Grade 4 event (cardiomyopathy). 
 
Neutropenia and febrile neutropenia 
Neutropenia events of any grade were also reported in similar proportions for the two treatment arms 
(Pl 76.0% and Bv 75.7%).  In both arms, the majority of neutropenia events were Grade 3 (Pl 33.9% 
vs. Bv 36.8%) or Grade 4 (Pl 21.9% vs. Bv 20.6%).   
Overall,  4  patients  in  each  arm  (Pl  1.7%  vs.  Bv  1.6%)  experienced  febrile  neutropenia  of  any  grade.  
In the bevacizumab arm, two of these events were Grade 3 and two were Grade 4.  In the placebo arm, 
three events were Grade 3 and one was Grade 4. 
 
Proteinuria  
In  Study  AVF4095g,  proteinuria  was  closely  screened  for  and  followed  with  urinary  protein-to-
creatinine ratio (UPCR) measurements at each cycle. 
The  overall  incidence  of  all  grade  proteinuria  was  4.7%  in  the  placebo  arm  versus  17.4%  in  the 
bevacizumab  arm.  The  median  time  to  onset  of  proteinuria  of  21.2 months  in  the  bevacisumab  (not 
reached in the placebo arm). All grade proteinuria had resolved in 10 of the 11 patients in the placebo 
arm and in 29 (67%) of the 43 patients in the bevacizumab arm during the AE reporting period. 
Proteinuria of Grade ≥ 3 was reported in a higher percentage of bevacizumab-treated patients (8.5%) 
than  in  patients  who  received  placebo  (0.4%).    The  majority  of  these  events  were  Grade  3  (8.1%).  
One patient in each treatment arm developed nephrotic syndrome. 
Among  patients  with  Grade≥ 3  proteinuria,  the  median  time  to  onset  of  was  26.5  months  in  the 
bevacizumab arm (not reached for the placebo arm).  Among patients who had Grade ≥ 3 proteinuria, 
the resolution rate during the AE reporting period was 100% (2 of 2 patients) in the placebo arm and 
86%  (18  of  21  patients)  in  the  bevacizumab  arm.    In  addition,  6  of  21  patients  with  Grade  ≥ 3 
proteinuria discontinued bevacizumab treatment. 
 
Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) 
Three patients in the bevacizumab arm were reported to have developed RPLS.  One patient developed 
RPLS during single-agent Bv treatment at Cycle 16) and 2 patients developed RPLS during concurrent

chemotherapy/Bv treatment in Cycles 4 and 5, respectively. A diagnosis of PRES requires confirmation 
by brain imaging, preferably magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 
 
One patient experienced a Grade 3 event of RPLS on 25 April 2008.  The event occurred during 
Cycle  16  and  led  to  discontinuation  of  Bv  treatment.    A  confirmatory  MRI  was  not  performed.    The 
event, which resolved on 5 May 2009, was considered by the investigator to be related to Bv treatment.  
This patient had a history of hypertension.  During the RPLS event, the patient had Grade 3 malignant 
and Grade 2 mental status changes. 
 
The second patient experienced a Grade 3 event of RPLS on 2 June 2008.  The event occurred 
during Cycle 4, was confirmed by MRI, and led to discontinuation of Bv treatment.  The event resolved 
on 8 June 2008 and was considered by the investigator to be related to Bv treatment.  Although this 
patient had no history of hypertension, she had Grade 3 hypertension at the time of the RPLS event. 
 
The third patient experienced a Grade 4 event of RPLS on 25 March 2009.  The event occurred 
during  Cycle  5,  was  confirmed  by  MRI,  and  led  to  discontinuation  of  Bv  treatment.    The  event  was 
ongoing at the time of Bv discontinuation and was considered  by the investigator to be  related to Bv 
treatment.  This patient had a history of hypertension.  Prior to the RPLS event, she had two episodes 
of Grade 2 headache and worsening hypertension. 
 
Venous thromboembolic events (VTE)  
Venous  thromboembolic  events  of  Grade ≥ 3  were  reported  in  a  higher  percentage  of  Bv-treated 
patients  (4.0%)  than  patients  who  received  Pl  (2.6%),  and  the  majority  of  these  were  Grade  3  VTE 
events.    Grade  3  VTEs  consisted  of  deep  venous  thrombosis  (Pl  0.4%  vs.  Bv  1.6%),  jugular  vein 
thrombosis (Pl 0% vs. Bv 0.4%), pulmonary embolism (Pl 0% vs. Bv 0.4%), thrombophlebitis (Pl 0.4% 
vs. Bv 0%), thrombophlebitis superficial (Pl 0% vs. Bv 0.4%), and thrombosis (Pl 0.4% vs. Bv 0.8%) 
Five  patients  experienced  Grade  4  VTEs.    Three  of  these  5  patients  were  in  the  placebo  arm  and 
developed  pulmonary  embolism.   One  bevacizumab-treated  patient  developed  a  pulmonary  embolism 
and  vena  cava  thrombosis,  and  one  bevacizumab-treated  patient  developed  a  pulmonary  embolism. 
There were no Grade 5 VTE events. 
 
Wound healing complications 
In  the  bevacizumab  arm,  one  patient  developed  a  Grade  3  wound  healing  complication,  and  one 
patient  developed  Grade  3  wound  dehiscence;  both  cases  resolved.    No  patients  in  the  placebo  arm 
experienced any wound healing complication events of Grade ≥ 3. 
Serious adverse events/deaths/other significant events 
The  overall  incidence  of  SAEs  (all  grades)  was  higher  in  the  bevacizumab  arm  (34.8%)  than  in  the 
placebo  arm  (24.9%).    However,  there  was  no  single  serious  adverse  event  with  a  2%  or  more 
increased incidence in the bevacizumab arm compared to the placebo arm.   
The  most  frequently  reported  SAEs  (all  grades)  were  GI  disorders  (Pl  6.9%  vs.  Bv  7.3%);  blood  and 
lymphatic  system  disorders  (Pl 6.4%  vs.  Bv  5.7%);  nervous  system  disorders  (3.0%  vs.  4.9%); 
respiratory,  thoracic,  and  mediastinal  disorders  (Pl  3.4%  vs.  Bv  4.0%);  infections  and  infestations 
(Pl 3.0% vs. Bv 4.0%) and vascular disorders (Pl 0.9% vs. Bv 5.3%).   
By  preferred  term,  the  SAEs  with  a  higher  incidence  in  the  bevacizumab  arm  compared  with  the 
placebo arm were anaemia (Pl 0.4% vs. Bv 2.4%), HTN (Pl 0.0% vs. Bv 1.6%), epistaxis (Pl 0.4% vs. 
Bv 2.0%), and RPLS (Pl 0.0% vs. Bv 1.2%).   
Of  the  144  patients  with  SAEs,  119  had  Grade  3–5  events,  and  a  greater  proportion  of  these  were 
patients in the bevacizumab arm (Pl 20.2% vs. Bv 29.1%).

As  of  the  date  of  the  data  cut-off  date  for  Study  AVF4095g,  141  (29.4%)  of  the  480  patients  who 
received any component of protocol treatment had died (Table 25).  The majority of these deaths were 
due to PD.

One adverse event was not treatment emergent. 
Two patients, 1 in each arm, had a treatment-emergent fatal (Grade 5) adverse event: the 
bevacizumab-treated patient died of an intracranial haemorrhage, and the placebo-treated patient died 
of a myocardial infarction. In addition, one patient in the bevacizumab arm died following an adverse 
event of sepsis that occurred 70 days after the last administration of bevacizumab and was not 
considered treatment emergent. One patient in the bevacizumab arm died of unknown causes 485 
days after treatment. 
Laboratory findings 
Safety  laboratory  evaluations,  including  physical  examinations,  BP,  and  laboratory  measurements 
performed  by  central  and  local  laboratories  (including  haematology,  serum  chemistry,  and  urinalysis) 
were performed for safety monitoring purposes. Other than at screening and at the time of treatment 
termination  and  with  the  exception  of  UPCR  and  CA125  levels  at  prespecified  intervals,  laboratory 
results were not collected on the patient’s case report form. Abnormal laboratory values were reported 
as  AEs  only  when  determined  to  be  clinically  significant  by  the  investigator  or  resulted  in  study 
withdrawal. Laboratory abnormality data were not reconciled with reported adverse events on a routine 
basis.   
Safety in special populations 
Age 
A summary of all AEs by age (< 65 vs.  65 years) has been provided.  All patients in both treatment 
arms  experienced  at  least  one  AE.    The  overall  incidence  of  Grade  ≥ 3  AEs  was  higher  in  the 
bevacizumab arm than in the placebo arm for each subpopulation (< 65 years:  Pl 84% vs. Bv 90%; 
≥ 65 years:  Pl 79.8% vs. Bv 88.5%).  
Within both age subgroups, there was a higher incidence of Grade ≥ 3 hypertension in bevacizumab-
treated  patients  than  in  patients  receiving  Pl  (< 65  years:    0.7%  vs.  12.5%;  ≥ 65  years:    0%  vs. 
22.9%).    However,  the  increased  incidence  of  hypertension  in  the  bevacizumab  arm  was  twofold 
higher  in  the  subgroup  of  those  ≥ 65  years  of  age.  Other  Grade 3–5  AEs  that  were  higher  in  the 
bevacizumab arm compared with the placebo arm did not show a substantial differential increase in the 
subgroup of those ≥ 65 years of age vs. the subgroup < 65 years of age. 
Race 
A summary of all AEs by race (White vs. non-White) has been provided. The percentages of White and 
non-White  patients  who  reported  at  least  one  Grade  3  AE  were:  Pl 81.4%  vs.  Bv  89.6%;  and  Pl 
92.3% vs. Bv 85.0% respectively.

N/A 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
A higher percentage of patients in the bevacizumab arm (19.8%) than in the placebo arm (4.7%) 
experienced an AE of any grade that led to discontinuation of study drug. The incidence of AEs leading 
to bevacizumab discontinuation in this study was similar to what is observed in other bevacizumab 
clinical trials across indications (19%). The most common non-hematologic AEs that led to drug 
discontinuation in bevacizumab -treated patients were hypertension (9 patients; 3.6%), proteinuria (6 
patients; 2.4%), RPLS (3 patients; 1.2%), and epistaxis (3 patients; 1.2%). Bevacizumab was 
discontinued because of neutropenia in 4 patients (1.6%) and thrombocytopenia in 4 patients (1.6%).  
The majority of study drug discontinuations in both arms occurred during the chemotherapy treatment 
phase (concurrent with Pl or Bv) of the study (Table 25). Eight of eleven patients in the placebo arm 
and 36 of 49 patients in the bevacizumab arm discontinued study drug between Cycles 1 and 10. In 
addition, 3 patients in the placebo arm and 13 patients in the bevacizumab arm discontinued during 
the single agent bevacizumab or placebo treatment–extension phase after completion of their 
chemotherapy. Through all phases of treatment, the most common AEs associated with discontinuation 
of bevacizumab were Grade 3 hypertension, persistent Grade 3 proteinuria, thrombocytopenia (Grades 
1, 3, and 4) and neutropenia (Grades 2–4). The most common AEs associated with discontinuation of 
bevacizumab during the single-agent extension phase were Grade 3 hypertension and Grade 3 
proteinuria. 
The median number of placebo and bevacizumab cycles was 10 and 12, respectively. 
Post marketing experience 
Bevacizumab  in  combination  with  intravenous  5-fluorouracil–based  chemotherapy  for  the  first-line 
treatment  of  patients  with  metastatic  carcinoma  of  the  colon  or  rectum  was  approved  in  the  United 
States  on  26  February  2004  and  in  the  European  Union  on  12  January  2005.    Subsequently,  
bevacizumab  was  approved  in  the  European  Union,  for  the  first-line  treatment  of  metastatic  breast 
cancer in combination with paclitaxel or capecitabine; unresectable, advanced, metastatic, or recurrent 
non-squamous  non–small  cell  lung  cancer  in  combination  with  platinum-based  chemotherapy; 
advanced and/or metastatic renal cell cancer in combination with interferon alfa-2a; and in metastatic 
cancer of the colon or rectum in combination with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. 
The  post–marketing  experience  with  bevacizumab  is  summarised  below  on  the  basis  of  safety  data 
contained in eight previously scheduled PSURs. The total number of patients exposed to Bv in the post-
marketing  setting  or in  clinical  trials  over  the  7-year  period  covered  by  the  PSURs  is  estimated  to  be 
approximately 1,080,098. 
During the 7-year period from 26 February 2004 to 25 February 2011, a total of 42,455 AEs, of which 
35,007  were  serious,  were  reported  in  23,148  patients  (2.1%).    In  2678  cases  (0.2%),  the  outcome 
was fatal.  
The most frequently reported SAEs in patients treated with bevacizumab during the reporting period 
26 February 2009–25 February 2011 were GI disorders (18.9%); respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal 
disorders (11.2%); general disorders and administration site conditions (10.0%); and vascular 
disorders (8.1%) (Table 26).

2.3.1 Discussion on clinical safety 
All  patients  in  both  treatment  arms  experienced  one  or  more  AE  of  any  grade.  For  patients  who 
received  bevacizumab  in  this  study,  the  most  frequently  reported  AEs  were  fatigue  (81.4%),  nausea 
(71.7%), neutropenia (68.8%), thrombocytopenia (57.9%), epistaxis (54.3%), and anaemia (52.6%). 
The majority of these were Grade 1 events, with the exception of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, 
the  majority  of  which  were  Grade  ≥  3.  Many  of  the  most  common  AEs  were  observed  with  ≥  5% 
higher incidence between the treatment arms.  
The incidence of Grade ≥ 3 AEs was greater in the bevacizumab arm (89.5%) compared to the placebo 
arm (82.4%). Grade 3–5 AEs for which the incidence was ≥ 2% higher in the bevacizumab arm than in 
the placebo arm were thrombocytopenia, nausea, fatigue, headache, proteinuria, dyspnoea, epistaxis,

and hypertension. The difference in the incidence of Grade 3–5 AEs between the treatment arms was 
primarily due to a higher incidence of certain events in bevacizumab-treated  patients, which included 
Grade  3  hypertension,  Grade  3  proteinuria,  and  Grade  4  thrombocytopenia.  In  the  younger  (<65 
years)  and  older  age  group  (≥  65  years),  the  overall  incidence  of  Grade  ≥  3  AEs  in  bevacizumab  -
treated patients was generally similar. 
Generally,  hypertension  was  observed  with  a  higher  frequency  (42.1%)  for  Bv-treated  patients  than 
earlier  reported  across  indications  (up  to  34%).  With  regard  to  age,  the  incidence  of  hypertension  of 
grade ≥ 3 among Bv-treated patients was twofold higher in the subgroup of patients ≥ 65 years of age 
than in the younger age group. The SmPC has been updated accordingly. The frequencies of grade ≥3 
proteinuria (8.1%) and grade 3 bleeding (6.5%) were also somewhat higher than previously reported 
for bevacizumab (frequencies up to 7% and 5%, respectively).  This has been adequately reflected in 
the amended SmPC. 
On  the  basis  of  previous  clinical  trials  with  bevacizumab,  some  AEs  are  identified  as  being  of  special 
interest (AESI). A higher proportion of patients in the bevacizumab arm reported at least one AESI of 
any Grade (Pl 85.0% vs. Bv 94.3%), including at least one Grade 3-5 AESI (Pl 61.8% vs. bevacizumab 
73.7%). Overall, AESI of Grade 3–5 for which there was a ≥ 2% higher incidence in the bevacizumab 
arm compared with the placebo arm were hypertension, proteinuria, and non-CNS bleeding.  
One of the phase II ovarian cancer studies, denoted AVF2949g, was prematurely terminated due to a 
high incidence of GI perforations; five patients out of 44 (11.4%) developed GI perforations, of which 
one  patient  died.  There  were  no  GI  perforations  in  the  other  ovarian  cancer  phase  II  study 
(GOG170D).  The  patients  included  in  study  AVF2949g  had  advanced  ovarian  cancer  resistant  to 
several  prior  treatments  and  this  alarmingly  high  incidence  of  GI  perforations  cannot  be  directly 
transferred to a population of patients with first recurrence. 
With regard to SAEs and GI disorders, however, 10 patients were reported by Preferred Term to have 
small intestinal obstruction; 4 of these were observed in the Bv arm.  
In the pivotal trials (GOG-0218 and BO17707) in support of the frontline ovarian cancer indication, the 
incidence  rates  of  gastrointestinal  (GI)  perforations  were  higher  in  all  bevacizumab-containing 
treatment arms compared to the control arms across both studies. Only patients in the bevacizumab-
containing treatment arms had events of GI perforations leading to death. 
In the pivotal study AVF4095g no patient reported a treatment-emergent GI perforation within the 30-
day  safety  reporting  period.  However,  two  patients,  both  in  the  bevacizumab  arm,  experienced  GI 
perforations after the 30-day post treatment AE reporting period. Considering the wide indication there 
is  a  risk  that  the  incidence  of  GI-perforations  will  be  higher  in  clinical  practice  than  what  has  been 
observed  in  the  pivotal  study.  A  cumulative  analysis  of  GIP  by  Grade  will  be  presented  in  the  next 
PSUR (see RMP). 
More SAEs were recorded in the Bv arm (34.8%) vs. 24.9% in the placebo arm. The majority of these 
events were not life-threatening (grade 3). The largest difference was observed for the MedDRA SOC 
of Vascular Disorders (overall incidence of 5.3% in the Bv arm vs. 0.9% in the placebo arm), however, 
there  was  no  single  SAE  with  more  than  a  2%  increased  incidence  in  the  Bv  arm  compared  to  the 
placebo arm. The SAEs with > 1% higher incidence in the Bv arm compared to the placebo arm were 
anaemia, hypertension, epistaxis and RPLS.  
During the study, 141 patients (29.4%) died, mainly due to disease progression. Fewer patients in the 
bevacizumab  arm  died  (25.5%)  as  compared  with  the  Pl  arm  (33.5%),  due  to  the  lower  number  of 
deaths classified as PD. One patient in each arm experienced a treatment emergent Grade 5 AE.

A  higher  percentage  of  patients  in  the  bevacizumab  arm  (19.8%)  than  in  the  placebo  arm  (4.7%) 
experienced an AE of any grade that led to discontinuation of study drug. The observed frequency is in 
line with what is seen in other clinical trials with bevacizumab, across indications. The majority of study 
drug  discontinuations  in  both  arms  occurred  during  the  chemotherapy  treatment  phase  (concurrent 
with  Pl  or  Bv)  of  the  study.  Through  all  phases  of  treatment,  the  most  common  AEs  associated  with 
discontinuation  of  bevacizumab  were  Grade  3  hypertension,  persistent  Grade  3  proteinuria, 
thrombocytopenia (Grades 1, 3, and 4) and neutropenia (Grades 2–4). 
Conclusions on clinical safety 
In  conclusion,  the  addition  of  bevacizumab  to  carboplatin/gemcitabine  for  up  to  10  cycles  and 
continued  as  single  agent  resulted  overall  in  a  well-known  pattern  of  safety  findings  in  patients  with 
recurrent  ovarian  cancer,  although  the  incidences  of  some  events  like  hypertension,  proteinuria  and 
low-grade  haemorrhages  were  slightly  higher in  this  patient  population.  The SmPC  has  been  updated 
accordingly.  The  safety  profile  was  overall  in  line  with  the  extensive  experience  with  bevacizumab 
across multiple oncology indications. No unexpected safety signals were seen in this study.

Haemorrhage 
Patients treated with Avastin have an 
increased risk of haemorrhage, especially 
tumour-associated haemorrhage. Avastin 
should be discontinued permanently in 
patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 
bleeding during Avastin therapy. Patients 
with untreated CNS metastases were 
routinely excluded from clinical trials with 
Avastin, based on imaging procedures or 
signs and symptoms. Therefore, the risk of 
CNS haemorrhage in such patients has not 
been prospectively evaluated in randomised 
clinical studies. Patients should be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of CNS 
bleeding, and Avastin treatment 
discontinued in case of intracranial 
bleeding. There is no information on the 
safety profile of Avastin in patients with 
congenital bleeding diathesis, acquired 
coagulopathy or in patients receiving full 
dose of anticoagulants for the treatment of 
thromboembolism prior to starting Avastin 
treatment, as such patients were excluded 
from clinical trials. Therefore, caution 
should be exercised before initiating 
therapy in these patients. However, 
patients who developed venous thrombosis 
while receiving therapy did not appear to 
have an increased rate of grade 3 or above

In five randomised clinical trials, the 
incidence of arterial thromboembolic events 
including cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), 
transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) and 
myocardial infarctions (MIs) was higher in 
patients receiving Avastin in combination 
with chemotherapy compared to those who 
received chemotherapy alone. Patients, 
receiving Avastin plus chemotherapy, with 
a history of arterial thromboembolism or 
age greater than 65 years have an 
increased risk of developing arterial 
thromboembolic events during therapy.  
Caution should be taken when treating 
these patients with Avastin. Therapy should 
be permanently discontinued in patients 
who develop arterial thromboembolic 
events.

2.5 Changes to the Product Information 
The MAH proposed the following changes to the Product Information (PI), to which the CHMP agreed: 
Update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order extend the indication of Avastin for the 
treatment of patients.  
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template which were 
reviewed by QRD and accepted by the CHMP. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
Patients  with  ovarian  cancer  that  recur  after  front-line  treatment  have  a  poor  prognosis  and  further 
lines of therapy are considered palliative, although some patients may actually respond to several lines 
of therapy and have a relatively long survival. Patients who experience disease recurrence > 6 months 
after  last  platinum-based  therapy  are  considered  platinum  sensitive.  In  general,  these  patients  are 
offered  re-treatment  with  a  platinum-based  therapy  either  combined  with  liposomal  doxorubicin, 
paclitaxel or gemcitabine.  
With the results of the single, pivotal, phase III, multicentre, randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled 
trial  AVF4095g  (OCEANS),  the  MAH  is  applying  for  an  extension  of  the  indication  of  bevacizumab  to 
include bevacizumab in combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine in the treatment of women with 
platinum-sensitive recurrent epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma.  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The  final  primary  analysis  of  PFS  (INV  assessed  and  censored  for  NPT)  was  submitted  as  part  of  the 
type  II  variation.  This  analysis  showed  a  statistically  significant  improvement  in  median  PFS  of  4 
months  for  patients  in  the  Bv  arm  compared  to  patients  in  the  Pl  arm  (median  PFS  for  Pl  arm  8.4 
months  vs.  Bv  arm  12.4  months)  with  a  HR  of  0.484  (95%  CI,  0.388,  0.605;  log-rank  p  <  0.0001). 
This translates into a 52% reduction in the risk of progression or death in patients treated with the Bv-
containing regimen. The K-M curves demonstrated an early separation after 2 months.  
The analysis of PFS based on IRC assessment supported the primary analysis with a HR of 0.451 (95% 
CI,  0.351,  0.580;  log-rank  p  <  0.0001)  and  a  gain  in  median  PFS  of  3.7  months  in  the  Bv  arm 
compared  to  the  Pl  arm  (Pl  8.6  months  vs.  Bv  12.3  months).  Additional  exploratory  and  sensitivity 
analyses  of  investigator  and  IRC  assessed  PFS  further  supported  the  result  of  the  primary  analysis. 
Importantly,  a  sensitivity  analysis  not  censoring  for  NPT  showed  a  very  similar  result  (HR  =  0.524 
(95%  CI:  0.425,  0.645)).  The  applicant  has  also  performed  a  “worst-case  analysis”  as  requested  in 
which all patients with NPT use were counted as events. In this very conservative analysis, the HR of 
PFS = 0.529 (95% CI: 0.430, 0-652).  
Consistent  PFS  results  were  found  in  the  pre-specified  subgroup  analysis  according  to  prognostic 
factors/  stratification  factors.  A  benefit  in  favour  of  the  bevacizumab-containing  arm  was  observed  in 
all subgroups investigated. 
ORR results were also in support of the Bv-containing treatment arm. A statistically significantly higher 
ORR  of  78.5%  (INV-determined)  was  observed  in  patients  treated  with  bevacizumab  compared  with 
57.4%  in  the  Pl  arm  (absolute  difference  of  21.1%  (p  <0.0001))  which  is  remarkable  in  this  setting. 
The majority of responses were PRs.  Similarly, median duration of objective response by investigator

assessment was improved by 3 months in the Bv arm (Pl 7.4 months vs. Bv 10.4 months; HR, 0.53; 
95% CI, 0.41, 0.70). 
At the time of the 3rd OS interim analysis (data cut-off date: 30 March 2012) 59% of patients had died 
overall (142 (58.7%) in the Pl arm and 144 (59.5%) in the Bv arm). The median OS was 33.7 months 
in the placebo arm compared to 33.4 months in the bevacizumab arm. The HR for OS = 0.964 (95% 
CI: 0.764; 1.216) (unstratified analysis).  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Exploratory  OS  analyses  based  on  number  of  post-progression  therapies  and  subgroup  OS  analyses 
based on demographic and baseline characteristics did not identify a clear OS benefit. Nevertheless, it 
was possible to rule out a significant detriment in OS for the Bv arm compared to the Pl arm in all of 
the subgroups analysed. It is acknowledged that it may be more difficult to demonstrate an OS benefit 
when the post-progression survival is relatively long as in this case (median OS of the Bv arm was 33 
months)  and  that  the  extensive  use  of  post-progression  therapies  including  bevacizumab  may  have 
confounded  the  OS  results.  It  is  the  most  likely  explanation  supported  by  a  number  of  exploratory 
post-hoc analyses, but no definitive explanation can be given. 
Possible explanations for the apparent lack of improvement in OS despite a clear PFS benefit have 
been adequately addressed by the MAH and accepted as a reasonable interpretation of the study data. 
Nevertheless, further follow-up is needed to provide further re-assurance on the benefit-risk of the 
product and the MAH is requested to provide this analysis by Q4 2013 for study AVF4095g (see Annex 
II of the PI).   
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
All patients experienced one or more AE of any grade, but the incidences of Grade 3-5 AEs and SAEs 
were higher in the Bv arm.  
For  patients  who  received  bevacizumab  in  this  study,  the  most  frequently  reported  AEs  were  fatigue 
(81.4%),  nausea  (71.7%),  neutropenia  (68.8%),  thrombocytopenia  (57.9%),  epistaxis  (54.3%),  and 
anaemia (52.6%). The majority of these were Grade 1 events, with the exception of thrombocytopenia 
and neutropenia, the majority of which were Grade ≥ 3. Many of the most common AEs were observed 
with  ≥  5%  higher  incidence  between  treatment  arms.  The  adverse  events  showing  the  greatest 
difference  and  highest  incidence  in  the  Bv  arm  were  hypertension,  epistaxis,  headache,  and 
proteinuria.  The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  of  Grade ≥  3  were  neutropenia,  thrombocytopenia, 
anaemia,  and  hypertension.  Grade  3–5  AEs  for  which  the  incidence  was  ≥ 2%  higher  in  the  Bv  arm 
than  in  the  Pl  arm  were  thrombocytopenia,  nausea,  fatigue,  headache,  proteinuria,  dyspnoea, 
epistaxis, and hypertension. 
In the pivotal study AVF4095g no patient reported a treatment-emergent GI perforation within the 30-
day  safety  reporting  period.  However,  two  patients,  both  in  the  bevacizumab  arm,  experienced  GI 
perforations after the 30-day post treatment AE reporting period. Considering the wide indication there 
is  a  risk  that  the  incidence  of  GI-perforations  will  be  higher  in  clinical  practice  than  what  has  been 
observed  in  the  pivotal  study.  A  cumulative  analysis  of  GIP  by  Grade  will  be  presented  in  the  next 
PSUR (see RMP).

The overall incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs), all grades, was higher in the Bv arm (34.8%) 
than in the Pl arm (24.9%), primarily because of a higher incidence of serious vascular disorders in the 
Bv arm (5.3%) compared to the Pl arm (0.9%). The most common SAE reported in the study overall 
was  thrombocytopenia  experienced  by  eight  patients  each  in  the  two  treatment  arms.  By  Preferred 
Terms (PT), the SAEs with a higher incidence in the Bv arm compared with the Pl arm were anaemia, 
hypertension, epistaxis, and RPLS. The proportion of patients who died of adverse events was similar 
across treatment arms (Pl: 0.4%, Bv: 1.2%). 
On  the  basis  of  previous  clinical  trials,  some  AEs  have  been  identified  as  being  of  special  interest 
(AESI) to bevacizumab. Generally, the AESI profile was similar to previous experience with Bv across 
other indications. However, hypertension was observed with a higher frequency (42.1%) for Bv-treated 
patients  than  earlier  reported  across  indications  (up  to  34%).  With  regard  to  age,  the  incidence  of 
hypertension of grade ≥ 3 among Bv-treated patients was twofold higher in the subgroup of patients ≥ 
65  years  of age  than  in  the  younger  age  group.  The  frequencies  of  grade ≥3  proteinuria  (8.1%)  and 
grade 3 bleeding  (6.5%)  were  also  somewhat  higher  than  previously  reported  for  bevacizumab 
(frequencies up to 7% and 5%, respectively).

Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Ovarian cancer is highly sensitive to antineoplastic chemotherapy, and responses are expected in the 
majority  of  women  who  receive  standard  platinum-  and  taxane  combination  chemotherapy  (following 
surgery)  in  the  front-line  setting.  Despite  this,  most  women  diagnosed  with  advanced  ovarian  cancer 
will have a recurrence of the disease. Second-line chemotherapy combinations are available, but there 
are well-known limitations to these regimens (lower response rate and shorter duration of responses). 
This is why there is an unmet medical need for a more efficacious treatment option.  
In this context, a HR for PFS of 0.48 and an absolute gain of 4 months in median PFS in favour of the 
Bv-containing  regimen  is  unprecedented  in  the  recurrent  setting.  The  primary  PFS  result  was 
consistently  supported  by  all  sensitivity  and  exploratory  analyses  of  PFS,  and  by  results  in  clinically 
relevant  patient  subgroups  based  on  ECOG  performance  status,  age,  histologic  subtype,  and 
stratification variables. The improvement in PFS achieved by adding Bv concurrently to chemotherapy 
and  extending  it  as  single  agent  therapy  was  also  associated  with  a  reduction  or  stabilisation  of  the 
tumour burden as 79% of the patients in the Bv arm experienced an objective response compared to 
58% in the Pl arm. The majority of responses were PRs. 
PFS is considered an acceptable endpoint for first recurrences, but a gain in PFS should preferably be 
accompanied by a positive trend in OS or at least no detrimental effects in OS in order to be regarded 
as a clinical benefit in itself. Although a positive trend in OS could have been expected, the extensive 
use  of  later  lines  of  therapy  may  have  confounded  OS  results.  In  the  most  recent  OS  analysis,  there 
was  no  significant  difference  in  OS  between  treatment  arms  and  no  indication  of  a  detrimental  effect 
on OS.  
The safety profile of bevacizumab in the current setting is considered acceptable and overall in line 
with the experience with bevacizumab across multiple oncology indications. No unexpected safety 
signals were seen in study AVF4095g.

Benefit-risk balance 
Based  on  the  important  clinical  benefit  observed  in  terms  of  PFS,  associated  with 
improvement in ORR with relevant response duration, and a well-characterised safety profile 
that was overall acceptable, the benefit-risk balance is considered positive. 
Discussion on the benefit risk balance 
The  progression  of  ovarian  cancer  is  characterized  by  a  relentless  increase  in  the  number  of 
burdensome symptoms including GI-disturbances, abdominal pain, dyspnoea and weight loss that can 
be  related  to  tumour  progression,  the  development  of  ascites  and  bowel  obstruction/dysfunction. 
Delaying  the  emergence  of  these  symptoms  by  stabilizing  the  disease  for  a  longer  period  could  be 
meaningful  to  patients  with  first  recurrence  of  platinum-sensitive  ovarian  cancer.  Importantly,  the 
addition  of  bevacizumab  offers  clearly  better  responses  than  the  available  standard  chemotherapy 
regimens.  It  is  also  acknowledged  that  a  prolongation  of  PFS  will  delay  the  need  for  subsequent 
therapies which potentially could be beneficial to patients. In ovarian cancer, platinum agents are still 
considered  the  most  active  chemotherapies  in  the  recurrent  setting.  Patients  with  a  longer  time 
interval  between  the  last  carboplatin  dose  and  progression  of  disease    have  a  higher  chance  of 
responding to platinum at rechallenged. Overall, it is thus considered reasonably well documented that 
the  improvement  in  PFS  as  demonstrated  in  study  AVF4095g  is  of  clinical  relevance  to  the  patients. 
The majority of AEs following use of Bv are considered clinically manageable. The analyses of AEs do 
not indicate more events following early termination of Bv.  
Study AVF4095 was set up without a programme for collection of specimen for analyses of candidate 
biomarkers with potential predictive properties for bevacizumab. This is considered a weakness of the 
study, since uncertainties in the characteristics of the target population who would benefit most from 
therapy with Bv still persist. However both studies GOG-0218 and BO17707 (first-line ovarian cancer) 
were set up with biomarker programmes, and verification of whether candidate markers identified in 
other tumour types may have predictive potential in ovarian cancer could be obtained from data 
collected in these studies. The results of these analyses will be available end of June 2012 (see Annex 
II of the Opinion).   
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends by consensus the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, 
concerning the following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
C.I.6.a 
Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new 
II 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
Update of section 4.1 of the SmPC in order to extend the indication of Avastin in combination with 
carboplatin and gemcitabine in patients with ovarian cancer as a second line treatment. Related 
changes were proposed to SmPC sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1. In addition, Annex II has been updated in 
order to revise the list of conditions. The Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated accordingly. 
Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the latest QRD template version 8. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, 
Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet.

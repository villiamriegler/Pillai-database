1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Update of section 5.2 (Pharmacokinetic properties) of 
the vardenafil SmPCs and relevant sections of the 
PLs to expand the information regarding vardenafil 
interactions with P-glycoprotein (P-gp) as a result of 
a general review of vardenafil pharmacokinetic 
properties. 
Editorial changes proposed by the MAH during the 
procedure have been accepted. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
led to an update of the product information. In vitro data 
suggests a potential effect of vardenafil on P-glycoprotein 
substrates more sensitive than digoxin as for example 
dabigatran etexilate and this has been reflected in Section 
5.2. of the SmPC.

6 September 2018. Based on the review of the Clinical 
study Report provided, the small sample size (only 10 
patients) makes any statistical analysis difficult and the 
study is unlikely to provide value for further risk 
assessment of NAION associated with the class of PDE5 
inhibitors indicated for the treatment of erectile 
dysfunction.

marketed for more than 15 years risks were considered 
fully characterised and appropriately managed through

unlikely that any pharmacovigilance activity could further

important potential and identified risks were removed from 
the RMP safety specification.

Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC to reflect data 
from two post-marketing observational studies 
indicating an increased risk of Non-arteritic Anterior 
lschaemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION) when using 
phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors. The MAH is 
also terminating the Bayer NAION study 12912 and 
the RMP is updated accordingly to version 5.0. 
In addition, the PI is brought in line with version 
10.0 of the QRD template and the contact details of 
the Bulgarian local representative are updated in the 
Package Leaflets. The PI for the 10 mg orodispersible 
tablet is updated for aspartame and sorbitol, 
according to the annex to the EC guideline on 
'Excipients in the labelling and package leaflet of 
medicinal products for human use'. Some editorial 
amendments are also made to the PI. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor use (such as 
vardenafil, tadalafil and sildenafil), as a class, occurred 
immediately before NAION onset (within 5 half-lives), 
compared to PDE5 inhibitor use in a prior time period. Due 
to the nature of the performed observational studies, no 
causality between PDE5i use and NAION can be 
established. Nevertheless, the study results enhance the 
current understanding of the association and are 
considered clinically relevant. 
The RMP version 5 reflects the termination of NAION study 
on March 2018 as it was concluded that the study is 
unlikely to provide value for further risk assessment of 
NAION associated with the class of PDE5 inhibitors 
indicated for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.

Adverse Drug Reactions related to PDE5 inhibitor class of

Following the assessment of the cumulative overview 
concerning the role of PDE5 inhibitors for urogenital 
bleeding events, it has been concluded that there is 
sufficient evidence for a possible relationship between PDE5 
inhibitor class and penile haemorrhage, haematospermia 
and haematuria. As a result of this assessment the MAH for 
Levitra/Vivanza has been asked the introduction of Penile 
haemorrhage, Haematospermia, and Haematuria to Section 
4.8 of the SmPC.

Therefore, section 4.3 of the SPC has been updated to

authorisation safety studies and the review of spontaneous 
reports of adverse events collected through the PSURs, the 
sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SPC are updated to reflect the 
interaction of vardenafil with alpha-blockers. 
When vardenafil was given at doses of 5, 10 or 20 mg on a 
background of stable therapy with tamsulosin, there was no 
symptomatic reduction in blood pressure, although 3/21 
tamsulosin-treated subjects exhibited transient standing 
systolic blood pressures of less than 85 mmHg. When 
vardenafil 5 mg was given simultaneously with terazosin 5 
or 10 mg, one of 21 patients experienced symptomatic 
postural hypotension. Hypotension was not observed when 
vardenafil 5 mg and terazosin administration was separated 
by 6 hours. 
Therefore, concomitant treatment   should be initiated only 
if the patient is stable on his alpha blocker therapy.  In 
those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, 
vardenafil should be initiated at the lowest recommended 
starting dose of 5mg. Vardenafil may be administered at 
any time with tamsulosin. With other alpha blockers a time 
separation of dosing should be considered when vardenafil

arteries that supply the optic nerve as it enters the eyeball 
or globe. In NAION vascular disease and arteriolosclerosis 
are assumed to cause infarction of the short posterior 
ciliary arteries supplying the anterior optic nerve.  
NAION is the most common acute optic nerve disease in 
adults over age 50. Reported incidence rates range from 
2.5/100,000/year in adults over 50 from two counties in 
the U.S. (Johnson et al., 1994) to a rate adjusted for age 
and sex distribution of 10.2/100,000 (95% CI: 6.5-15.6) 
from the Ohmstead County study (Hattenhauer, 1997). 
Although the aetiology of NAION is unknown, many of its 
risk factors are similar to those for erectile dysfunction such 
as ischemic heart disease, hypertension, 
hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and increased age 
(Hayreh, 1995).NAION has been an issue of concern with 
PDE5 inhibitors. However, the fact that some of the risk 
factors for NAION are likely to be present in the population 
exposed to these drugs have made difficult to draw any 
firm conclusion about the association.

Pomeranz et al (2005) describe seven patients, aged 
between 50 and 69 years, who had typical features of 
NAION within 36 hours after ingestion of PDE5 inhibitors . 
Other articles describe cases of NAION after use of PDE5 
inhibitors. Articles by Pomeranz et al (2002), Egan et al 
(2000), Boshier et al (2002), Cunningham et al (2001) and 
Gruhn et al (2005) describe additional 9 cases. However, 
these cases do not clarify whether the association is 
causally related. There is an additional publication by Dheer 
et al (2002). 
The CHMP conducted a review of cases of NAION for all

In order to further clarify the interactions information that

nitrate study showed that symptomatic effect (hypotension

vardenafil group rather than in the placebo group following 
the NTG administration. The contraindication for the 
concomitant use of vardenafil and nitrates is therefore 
maintained and further information was added in section 
4.5 of the SPC with regards to this interaction. The results 
of the alpha blocker studies demonstrated that when 5 mg 
vardenafil was given on a background of stable tamsulosin 
therapy there were no clear differences in blood pressure 
effects between vardenafil and placebo. When 5 mg 
vardenafil was given simultaneously with terazosin therapy 
some patients experienced hypotension. This did not occur 
when there was a six hour dosing separation between 
vardenafil and terazosin. Information on this findings was 
added to section 4.4 and 4.5 of the SPC.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Iron overload is the result of many disorders inducing an increased net entry of iron within the body 
and can lead per se to the development of organ damage and increased mortality. It can be classified 
as primary or secondary depending whether it results from a primary defect in the regulation of iron 
balance or is secondary to other genetic or acquired disorders. A known example of primary iron 
overload is hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC), in which iron is absorbed in excess because of 
increased iron transfer from the enteral cells to the blood. The secondary includes iron overload either 
due to, or associated with, ineffective erythropoiesis, chronic liver diseases, parenteral administration 
or ingestion of excessive amounts of iron. Thalassemia major and sideroblastic anemia are the two 
best studied examples of iron overload secondary to blood transfusions and ineffective erythropoiesis. 
Frequent blood transfusions lead to excessive accumulation of iron with a toxic accumulation in 3 to 10 
years. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Transfusional iron overload: Patients with conditions leading to chronic anemia develop transfusional 
iron overload as a consequence of multiple blood transfusions. The underlying conditions include beta-
thalassemia, sickle cell disease, myelodysplastic syndrome, Diamond- Blackfan anemia (DBA) and 
other anemias.. 
Assessment report  
EMA/639290/2017 
Page 7/36 
  
  
2.1.3.  Management 
The aim of treatment of iron storage disease is to remove from the body the excess iron that has 
accumulated. In the case of patients without primary disorders of haematopoiesis (i.e. primary 
haemochromatosis), this is best achieved by phlebotomy, since regeneration of erythrocytes by the 
marrow utilises iron, which is therefore withdrawn from various body pools. Phlebotomy is only 
occasionally feasible. Patients who have augmented iron stores because of ineffective erythropoiesis 
and those in whom the iron overload is the result of multiple transfusions require treatment with an 
iron chelating agent to achieve safe levels of body iron. This is a slow process because only a small 
proportion of body iron is available for chelation at any moment. By increasing the doses of chelators 
in an attempt to speed up iron removal, there is a risk of increasing the toxicity of iron chelators by 
chelating iron, which is needed for normal tissue metabolism. Therefore, while the slow process of 
decreasing tissue iron to safe levels is being achieved, a second goal is to make the iron as safe as 
possible by binding the toxic iron pools responsible for causing tissue damage. Iron chelation therapy 
reduces iron-related morbidity, reduces and retards liver diseases, diabetes and other endocrine 
failures, normalizes growth and sexual development, prevents, and in some cases reverses, cardiac 
insufficiency and improves quality of life. Consequently iron chelation therapy dramatically reduces 
mortality. 
About the product 
Deferasirox (Exjade) is an orally active chelator that is highly selective for iron III. It is indicated for 
the treatment of chronic iron overload due to frequent blood transfusions (≥  7 mL/kg/month of packed 
red blood cells) in patients with beta thalassaemia major aged 6 years and older and when 
deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate. 
Deferasirox is already commercialised and currently available as a dispersible tablet (DT) for once daily 
administration at strengths of 125 mg, 250mg and 500 mg, and as a film-coated tablet (FCT) for once 
daily administration at strengths of 90 mg, 180 mg and 360 mg. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
To improve palatability and patient compliance, and potentially the safety profile for gastrointestinal 
(GI) tolerability, the MAH has developed a new lactose-free formulation for oral administration, 
presented as two different dosage forms: granules packaged in sachets, and a film-coated tablet 
(FCT). The granules and FCT contain the same compendial excipients in the same proportions 
(cellulose, microcrystalline; crospovidone; povidone; magnesium stearate; silica, colloidal anhydrous; 
poloxamer). The only difference in content between the forms (FCT and granules) is the coating 
material used for the FCT (hypromellose, titanium dioxide (E171), macrogol 4000, talc and indigo 
carminine aluminum lake (E132)), which is absent from the granules. The new formulation contains 
deferasirox, the same active substance as in the DT formulation (Exjade).  
The film-coated tablet was approved in the USA on 30-Mar-2015 (NDA 206-910), and in Canada on 
24-Feb-2016, under the tradename Jadenu. It also received positive CHMP Opinion in the European 
Union on 28-Jan-2016, followed by European Commission decision on 22-March-2016, under the 
tradename Exjade. Only the granules are the subject of this submission. 
Assessment report  
EMA/639290/2017 
Page 8/36 
  
  
The development program for granules includes a total of five clinical pharmacology studies in healthy 
adult subjects (Table 3) and an additional pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) investigation in 
patients diagnosed with transfusion- dependent iron overload, using a pharmacokinetic comparability 
approach. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as granules containing 90, 180 or 360 mg of deferasirox as active 
substance.  
Other ingredients are: microcrystalline cellulose, crospovidone, povidone, magnesium stearate, 
colloidal anhydrous silica and poloxamer. 
The product is available in PET/Aluminium/PE foil sachets as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Exjade 90, 180 and 360 mg granules contain the same active substance, deferasirox, as that used to 
manufacture the already-authorised dispersible tablets and film-coated tablets. The active substance is 
sourced from the same manufacturer, manufactured with the same process and released in accordance 
with the same active substance specifications. Therefore, the applicant presented no new information 
in the dossier to support this line extension application. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Exjade granules containing 90, 180 or 360 mg of deferasirox are an immediate release dosage form 
aimed at patients with difficulty in swallowing tablets. The three presentations are dose proportional 
and differentiated by the colour of the sachets which are also printed with the respective strengths. 
The composition is identical to the uncoated tablets cores of Exjade film-coated tablets, approved as a 
line extension in 2016. 
As for the film-coated tablets, the aim of development was to produce a dosage form equivalent to the 
already-approved dispersible tablets (125, 250 or 500 mg of deferasirox) with improved patient 
compliance. The dispersible tablets contain lactose and sodium lauryl sulfate which are thought to 
cause gastro-intestinal side effects. In addition, they are chalky and unpalatable once added to the 
required large volume of water indicated in the SmPC, and the large observed food effect means they 
must be taken on an empty stomach. One requirement of the paediatric investigation plan (PIP) was to 
develop a more palatable orally available dosage form and the line extensions for the film-coated 
tablets, and thereafter for the granules, fulfil that request. Both the granules proposed in this 
application, and the film-coated tablets, contain a higher percentage of active substance than the 
dispersible tablets which reduces the dose burden for patients. The granules remove the requirement 
to manually crush film-coated tablets for patients who have difficulty swallowing. 
Assessment report  
EMA/639290/2017 
Page 9/36 
  
  
Pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. The quality target product 
profile (QTPP) was defined as an orally available immediate release dosage form, which can be 
swallowed easily when dispersed on food, with equivalent in vivo performance and exposure to 
dispersible Exjade tablets. The granules should be sufficiently stable in the primary package which 
should also be child-resistant. Critical quality attributes (CQAs) were identified as appearance and 
integrity of packaging, identity, assay, content uniformity, impurity profile, dissolution and microbial 
limits. Identity and microbial limits are unlikely to be impacted by formulation and process variables. 
Deferasirox is non-hygroscopic and practically insoluble in water. As a result, the active substance is 
micronized to reduce its particle size which is controlled by specification. The required polymorph is the 
more stable of the two identified and is routinely produced by the active substance manufacturing 
process. It has good permeability and is thus BCS II, exhibiting dissolution limited biopharmaceutics. 
The choice of excipients used in the film-coated tablet formulation was based on compatibility test 
results of binary mixtures with the drug substance.  Excipients were chosen to optimize the dissolution 
profile and stability whilst minimizing adverse effects and are qualitatively and quantitatively identical 
to those used in the film-coated tablet cores. In contrast to the dispersible tablets, the granules do not 
contain lactose which will ensure better acceptance in lactose-intolerant patients. The film-coated 
tablets require less disintegrant as they are intended to be swallowed rather than dispersed. As a 
result, the percentage of active substance in the formulation increased resulting in smaller tablets 
which are easier to swallow. Sodium lauryl sulfate was replaced by poloxamer to further reduce gastric 
irritation. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with 
Ph. Eur. standards. Additional particle size limits are set for the two types of MCC and poloxamer. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included 
in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
For administration, the granules can be sprinkled on soft food such as plain non-fat yoghurt or apple 
sauce. Compatibility with the proposed vehicles was tested in a stability study which showed no 
increase in degradants or decrease in assay over 24 hours. 
The dissolution method was developed based on the method approved for the film-coated tablets, but 
with a tighter specification. The combination of a tight dissolution specification, raw material 
specifications and controlled process parameters was deemed sufficient to ensure adequate and 
consistent dissolution performance. 
Comparability was demonstrated clinically by comparing 4 sachets of the 90 mg strength against a 
single 500 mg dispersible tablet. The biobatch was manufactured according to the proposed 
commercial process and at the proposed manufacturing site. 
Since the 3 proposed strengths are dose proportional, differing only in fill weight of the sachets, a 
biowaiver was proposed for the 180 and 360 mg strengths based on comparison of f2 values of 4 x 90 
mg sachets, 2 x 180 mg sachets and 1 x 360 mg sachet at multiple physiologically-relevant pHs. Since 
these were all >50 (range 63-99), then a biowaiver was considered justified. 
The formulation and manufacturing process development were evaluated through the use of risk 
assessment, performed using failure mode effect analysis (FMEA) and Ishikawa diagrams in order to 
identify potential critical process parameters (CPPs). The risk identification was based on the prior 
knowledge of products with similar formulations and manufacturing processes as well as on the 
experience from formulation development, process design and scale-up studies of the already-
approved film-coated tablets. 
Assessment report  
EMA/639290/2017 
Page 10/36 
  
  
Based on the risk assessment, and drawing on knowledge of the identical granules used in the film-
coated tablets (where some potential CPPs had already been studied), several parameters were 
identified for further DoE (Design of Experiments) studies. The final CPPs and suitable set points were 
defined based on the DoE results and are considered acceptable. 
Three pre-validation batches of each strength were then manufactured according to the defined 
process parameters. All 9 batches passed release testing. In contrast to the approved Exjade 
presentations, no design space is claimed for the granules. 
The primary packaging is PET/Aluminium/PE foil sachets. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  shown  below  consists  of  four  main  steps:  blending  of  deferasirox  with 
intra-granular  excipients;  wet  granulation  and  drying;  blending  with  extra-granular  excipients;  filling 
into sachets. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  on  three  consecutive  production  scale 
batches  of  each  strength.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  capable  of 
producing  the  finished  product  of  intended  quality  in  a  reproducible  manner.  The  in-process  controls 
are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form  and 
comprise  tests  for  appearance  (container  and  contents),  identity  (UV,  HPLC),  mean  mass  of  contents 
(weight),  mass  uniformity  of  contents  (Ph.  Eur.),  dissolution  (HPLC),  uniformity  of  delivered  dose 
(HPLC),  degradation  products  (HPLC),  microbial  enumeration  tests  (Ph.  Eur.),  assay  (HPLC)  and 
uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.). 
Deferasirox is very stable and no impurities have been noted above the identification threshold 
throughout the lifecycles of other marketed Exjade presentations. A risk assessment was carried out to 
determine the likelihood of metal contaminants being present in the finished product in accordance 
with ICH Q3D. Furthermore, analysis data from multiple batches of finished product showed that no 
class 1-3 elemental impurities, were present above 2% of their permitted daily exposure (PDE) levels. 
The absence of tests for elemental impurities is considered justified. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 1 pilot and 6 production scale batches of the 90 mg sachets and 
3 production scale batches each of the 180 and 360 mg sachets confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. No 
impurities were observed above 0.05%.

EMA/639290/2017 
Page 11/36 
  
  
Stability of the product 
Three  production  scale  batches  each  of  90,  200  and  400  mg  sachets  were  used  for  stability  studies. 
During  development,  the  200  and  400  mg  presentations  were  reduced  to  180  and  360  mg 
respectively.  All  presentations  are  qualitatively  and  quantitatively  proportional  and  are  packed  in  the 
same size sachets proposed for marketing. The 200 mg and 400 mg sachets were manufactured using 
the proposed commercial process at the proposed settings, the only difference being the amount filled 
into  each  sachet  and  the  manufacturing  scale  which  was  four  times  larger.  Therefore,  data  from  the 
200  and  400  mg  sachets  is  considered  representative  of  the  180  and  360  mg  sachets  respectively. 
Additional  stability  studies  using  three  production  scale  batches  of  each  strength  (90,  180,  360  mg) 
will be carried out following authorization. Samples were stored for up to 24 months under long term 
conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), up to 24 months under intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 75% RH) and 
for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  (40  ºC  /  75%  RH)  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines. 
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance  (container  and  contents),  dissolution,  degradation  products  and 
assay. Microbial enumeration tests were carried out at the end of shelf-life. The analytical procedures 
used are stability indicating. No significant changes to any of the measured parameters were observed 
in any of the samples tested.    
In  addition,  one  batch  of  each  strength  was  exposed  to  light  as  defined  in  the  ICH  Guideline  on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. No significant degradation was observed. 
Samples were also stored under freeze/thaw conditions (between -20 oC and ambient temperature) for 
up to 6 months and no significant changes were observed. 
In  use  stability  studies  were  carried  out  using  1  batch  of  the  90,  200  and  400  mg  presentations. 
Sachets were poured onto either apple sauce or yoghurt and stability monitored for up to 24 hours. No 
significant changes to either assay or impurity measurements indicating that granules are stable when 
mixed with either vehicle. 
Based  on  available  stability  data,  the  proposed  shelf-life  of  36  months  without  special  storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. The magnesium stearate is of 
vegetal origin.

been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. The formulation is 
based on the already marketed film-coated tablets. The applicant has applied QbD principles in the 
development of the finished product and its manufacturing process although no design space is 
claimed. Suitable controls are set for CPPs and the manufacturing process has been validated. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were submitted for the granule formulation. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new studies were submitted for the granule formulation. 
Two pharmacokinetic studies [Study 0900739], [Study 1000323] were conducted in dogs using single 
oral doses of 375 mg deferasirox, to support the development of the film-coated tablets and granule 
formulation of deferasirox. The results of these studies were presented in the line extension application 
for film-coated tablets.  
A total of six new formulations were tested in dogs, and bioavailability relative to the dispersible 
tablets was estimated for each formulation. Non-enteric coated tablets showed comparable exposure 
to the reference dispersible formulation whereas bioavailability of the two enteric-coated tablet 
formulations was approximately 50% lower than that of the DT formulation [Study 0900739]. Contrary 
to results with these new tablet formulations, enteric coated pellets resulted in comparable 
bioavailability to the DT formulation [Study 1000323]. This was likely due to the effect of surfactant 
used in the enteric-coated pellet formulation. Based on these findings, new formulations were further 
modified for the use in a pilot pharmacokinetic study in humans.  
No additional pharmacokinetic studies in laboratory species were conducted to test new formulations. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
No specific toxicology studies have been submitted for the granule formulation. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The calculation of the predicted environmental concentration in the initially submitted ERA as part of 
the original Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for Exjade was based on a forecast peak annual 
amount in 2013.  Current sales forecasts remain well below the initial estimate used as basis for the 
original ERA. Thus, the previously submitted ERA was based on a very conservative approach for the 
calculation of the potential environmental exposure. The previously submitted ERA demonstrated no 
concern for the environment. The current application is not expected to lead to an increase in the 
initially projected potential environmental exposure.  
Assessment report  
EMA/639290/2017 
Page 13/36 
  
  
Therefore, the current application is excluded from the requirement to submit an environmental risk 
assessment. It is expected that the use of deferasirox does not lead to any significant risk to the 
environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
According to the guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) of medicinal product for 
human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr2), the evaluation of the environmental impact should be 
made if there is an increase in the environmental exposure.  
The molecule in this application is similar to the marketed one. Consequently environmental exposure 
with deferasirox is not expected to increase. The justification provided by the MAH for not submitting 
an updated ERA is considered acceptable. Therefore, deferasirox formulated as granules is not 
expected to pose a risk to the environment different from those identified for the initial market 
approval. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new nonclinical data are being included with the present submission for the granules. The 
toxicology and nonclinical pharmacology studies previously conducted for the dispersible tablets and 
the pharmacokinetic studies in dogs submitted with the line extension for film-coated tablets are 
considered to support the safety profile of the granules. 
Regarding the ERA, Deferasirox formulated as granules is not expected to increase the environmental 
exposure compared to the current marketed Exjade form and to pose a risk to the environment 
different from those already identified in the initial market approval.

2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Deferasirox is already commercialised and currently available as a dispersible tablet (DT) for once daily 
administration at strengths of 125, 250 and 500mg. The pharmacokinetics of deferasirox has been well 
characterised in healthy volunteers and in iron-overloaded patients. It was described in detail in the 
previously submitted marketing authorisation application and included in the SmPC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/639290/2017 
Page 15/36 
  
  
 
The MAH has developed a new formulation for oral administration, presented as two different dosage 
forms: granules (G) packaged in sachets and a film-coated tablet (FCT). The granules and FCT contain 
the same compendial excipients in the same proportions. The only difference in content between the 
forms (FCT and granules) is the coating material used for the FCT, which is absent from the granules. 
Based on the improved bioavailability of the new formulation, three strengths as 90 mg, 180 mg and 
360 mg (which are compositionally proportional) were developed. The granules dosage form is 
intended to further enhance patients’ convenience of use, especially for the paediatric and geriatric 
patients, who might have difficulty swallowing the FCT as whole and/or crushing the FCT. 
The present submission concerns the registration of the granules form at the same three dosage 
strengths of 90, 180 and 360mg (compositionally proportional) in line with those of the FCT. It is 
based on a dose adjusted pharmacokinetic comparability approach to the approved DT formulation. To 
support the Granules dossier, the MAH submitted five clinical pharmacology studies.  
Generally, the used bioanalytical methods appear adequate and comply with acceptance criteria 
regarding selectivity, sensitivity accuracy and precision. Analytical validation reports were provided 
with satisfactory results. Short and long-term stability of the analytes in biological matrix were tested 
and shown to be satisfactory. ISR were performed with satisfactory results. A representative number 
of chromatograms were provided by the MAH.  
Pharmacokinetic parameters such as AUCinf, AUClast, Cmax, T1/2 and Tmax of deferasirox in plasma 
were estimated using non-compartmental analysis in Phoenix (WinNonlin 6.2).  
Primary pharmacokinetic parameters, AUClast, AUCinf, and Cmax, were log-transformed and analysed 
using a linear mixed effects model including treatment, period, sequence, and subject as effects. 
Geometric mean ratio (test/reference) and its 90% confidence interval for primary pharmacokinetic 
parameters were reported. The standard methodology for statistical analysis was used. 
Intensive plasma concentration data from healthy subjects were used for PK evaluations of 
deferasirox. In all studies, blood samples for the determination of deferasirox concentrations in plasma 
were collected at pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72 hours post-dose.  
In all pharmacokinetic studies, the amount of drug used was selected to be approximately equivalent 
to the clinically relevant recommended starting dose of 20 mg/kg of the DT (1500 mg in a 75kg 
subject). The doses of 1080 and 1200mg used for the Granules formulation are estimated to be in the 
range of 15-25 mg/kg of the DT. The design, number of subjects, strengths and dosing used could be 
acceptable. The washout period (between 6 to 9 days depending on study) is considered adequate 
(with expected half-life for deferasirox between 10 and 16h) to allow the complete elimination of the 
drug before subsequent dosing and to minimise the possibility of a carry-over effect. 
In a pilot PK comparability study (F2105) including 41 healthy subjects, the relative bioavailability of a 
reduced dose 1200mg of the deferasirox granule formulation given with a soft food matrix (apple 
sauce) versus the reference DT at 1500mg under fasted conditions. The primary PK parameters of the 
two treatments were not in the range of the reference bioequivalence criteria of [0.8-1.25]. Indeed, 
the geometric mean ratios and 90% CIs for AUClast, and Cmax (1200 mg deferasirox granules vs 
1500 mg deferasirox DT) were 1.22 (90% CI: 1.16, 1.28), and 1.41 (90% CI: 1.33, 1.49), 
respectively. Thus, the study confirmed the improved bioavailability of the granule formulation 
(already seen with the FCT) compared to the DT formulation and lead to test lower granules doses. 
A pivotal bioavailability study (F1102), conducted in 97 Japanese healthy subjects, was performed to 
evaluate the PK comparability of two reduced doses (1080 and 990 mg) of the deferasirox granules 
versus the reference DT (1500mg) under fasted conditions. The exposure (AUCinf, AUClast) of both 
Assessment report  
EMA/639290/2017

1080 and 990mg deferasirox granules were found to be equivalent to the DT, with geometric mean 
ratios of 1.09 (90% CI: 1.05- 1.14) and 0.99 (0.95-1.05), respectively compared to the DT. However, 
the peak concentration of the granules was respectively 34 and 24 % higher with the 1080 and 990mg 
strengths than that of the DT. Based on these findings and to keep the granule dose consistent with 
the FCT, the 1080 mg granule was chosen as the comparable dose to the 1500mg. this approach is 
acceptable. Since ethnicity (Asians, Blacks, Caucasians) does not affect the PKs of deferasirox (based 
on submitted data in original dossier) the fact that PK comparability between the two formulations 
(Granules versus DT) were conducted in Japanese healthy subjects is not deemed to jeopardize the 
results. 
Study F2106 (food effect study) compared the PKs of deferasirox in 52 healthy subjects who received 
1200 mg of deferasirox granules under fasted conditions (three modalities: A- with water, or B- with 
apple sauce, or C- with yogurt), low-fat breakfast, or high-fat breakfast conditions. The results 
indicated a lack of food effect when deferasirox granules are administered with soft food (apple sauce 
or yogurt) compared to the reference fasted conditions with water. When deferasirox granules were 
given with a low fat meal, the AUC was unchanged (90% CI meet the bioequivalence criteria), and the 
Cmax decreased slightly by 11% (90% CI: 0.79 -0.99). With a high -fat meal, the AUC was mildly 
increased by 18%-19% (90% CI: 1.09 -1.29) while the Cmax was similar to under fasted conditions. 
Overall, systemic availability of the new granules formulation deferasirox under fed conditions appears 
to be slightly modified and the food effect is not expected to be clinically relevant.  
The dose-proportionality of deferasirox PK has been characterised in study F2104 (already submitted 
in the previous application for the FCT dosage form). The study was conducted on 21 healthy subjects 
and using the granule formulation. Following a single dose of deferasirox granules, the increase in 
mean deferasirox exposure (AUC), and peak concentration (Cmax) could be considered dose 
proportional in the dose range of 400 to 1200 mg. Indeed, the estimated proportionality coefficients 
(beta) and the 90% confidence interval for AUClast 1.13 (90% CI 1.07, 1.19), AUCinf 1.13 (90% CI 
1.07, 1.20) and Cmax 0.90 (90% CI 0.79, 1.01) were within the bioequivalence interval of [0.80 - 
1.20].  
The new formulation is characterised by an improved bioavailability that leads to about 30% dose 
reduction, and a reduced food effect than the reference commercialised DT. The deferasirox PK of the 
granules formulation (AUC and Cmax) is dose proportional in the dose range of 400 to 1200 mg in 
healthy subjects. Based on dose-adjusted approach, the AUC of deferasirox granules at 1080 mg was 
equivalent to that of DT 1500 mg based on the bioequivalence criteria of [80-125%]. However, the 
mean peak concentration of the granules was 34% higher than that of the DT. The clinical impact of 
this higher Cmax with the FCT was investigated in the PK/PD relationship analysis (A2409 study). 
Assessment report  
EMA/639290/2017 
Page 17/36 
  
  
The PKPD relationship for deferasirox has been evaluated using a large clinical trial in the target 
population (n= 1112). A covariate analysis using a proportional odds model was performed to 
determine the relative impact of C2h and trough concentrations at steady state (as a surrogate 
markers of respectively Cmax and exposure of deferasirox) on the efficacy (serum ferritin change from 
baseline) and safety (serum creatinine and creatinine clearance change from baseline) deferasirox 
treatment endpoints. The analysis showed that Ctrough had a strong impact on creatinine clearance 
change in categories (p<0.0001) but C2h,ss had minimal impact (p=0.2544) after adjusting for 
Ctrough,ss. Furthermore, a C2h,ss increase by 1.7-fold would provide an odds ratio of worsening from 
baseline in creatinine clearance categories of 1.146 (0.906, 1.449). A similar conclusion could be 
drawn regarding the relationship of AUC and Cmax to efficacy. At steady state, Ctrough has a 
statistically significant impact (p<0.001) on the changes in serum ferritin while C2h has no statistically 
significant impact (p=0.130). In particular, after adjusting for Ctrough,ss, an increase in C2h,ss by 
70% would lead to a change of -1.28% (90% CI: -2.65%, 0.12%) in the percent change from baseline 
in serum ferritin which is clinically insignificant. 
Based on these results, it appears that overall exposure (AUC) is the key parameter for assessing 
deferasirox safety and efficacy. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamics data were submitted. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PKs of the new deferasirox granule formulation has been sufficiently characterised in healthy 
volunteers (see the PK overview for detail). The new formulation is characterised by an improved 
bioavailability and a reduced food effect than the reference marketed DT. The PK of the granules (AUC 
and Cmax) is dose proportional in the dose range of 400 to 1200 mg. The AUC of deferasirox granules 
at 1080 mg was equivalent to that of the DT at 1500 mg, based on the bioequivalence criteria of [80-
125%]. However, the mean peak concentration of the granules was 34% higher than that of the DT. 
Based on a retrospective PKPD analysis in a large clinical trial in the target population, it appears that 
overall exposure (AUC) is the key parameter for assessing deferasirox safety and efficacy. Thus, the 
observed higher Cmax (with a similar AUC) with the granules formulation are not likely to result 
clinically in worsening creatinine laboratory values or in a significant change on serum ferritin from 
baseline. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of the granule formulations data are considered appropriate and supportive 
of this application. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
No new efficacy data were submitted.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
This application cross-referred to the existing efficacy data generated with the dispersible tablet 
formulation.  
An additional [Study A2409 PK/PD analysis] included in this submission confirmed the influence of AUC 
on efficacy. Efficacy would probably not be affected by the observed Cmax differences. The available 
data fully support the therapeutic equivalence of the strength-adjusted new granules. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of the granule formulation- is considered appropriate and supportive of this application.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Safety data collected in healthy volunteer were provided from the following studies: 
Study ICL670F2104:  
“A randomized, open-label, single-centre, Phase I, four period cross-over study evaluating the 
bioavailability of new deferasirox granule formulation in comparison to the reference deferasirox 
(Exjade) marketed formulation in healthy subjects.” This study compared the bioavailability after a 
single dose of the new deferasirox granule formulation vs. the dispersible tablet formulation as a 
reference. In addition, dose linearity of 400 mg, 800 mg and 1200 mg granules was tested relative to 
DT. 
Study ICL670F2105:  
“A randomized, open-label, single-center, Phase I, two-way, cross-over study to evaluate the 
pharmacokinetic comparability of deferasirox new granule formulation with the reference dispersible 
formulation in healthy subjects.” This study evaluated the pharmacokinetic comparability of deferasirox 
granule formulation (1200 mg), given with apple sauce (Treatment A), with the reference dispersible 
tablet formulation of deferasirox (1500 mg) under fasting conditions (Treatment B). 
Study ICL670F2106:  
“A single-center, open-label, randomized, two arms, cross-over study to investigate the effect of food 
on the pharmacokinetics of new deferasirox granule formulation in healthy subjects.” This was a three 
period, 12 sequence (six per arm), cross-over study to assess the effect of food on the 
pharmacokinetics of deferasirox granules (1200 mg) when administered with: 1) apple sauce or yogurt 
(Arm 1 Treatment B and C) and 2) low-fat 450 kcal breakfast or a highfat 1000 kcal breakfast, 
compared to fasting conditions (Arm 2 Treatment D and E). 
Assessment report  
EMA/639290/2017 
Page 19/36 
  
  
Study ICL670F1102:  
“A randomized, open label, six sequences, cross-over study in healthy Japanese subjects to evaluate 
the pharmacokinetic comparability of deferasirox granule formulation with the reference dispersible 
tablet formulation (Exjade).” Part 1 of the study evaluated two doses of deferasirox granules (1080 mg 
and 990 mg) in comparison to the reference dispersible tablet formulation of deferasirox (1500 mg) 
under fasting conditions in healthy Japanese subjects. Study F1102-Part 1 serves as the pivotal 
comparability PK study supportive of the present submission. Since the results from Part 1 of the study 
did not meet the criteria acceptable to file a new formulation application in Japan, a reduced dose of 
900 mg granules was further tested in Part 2 of the study. Part 2 was a randomized, open label, two 
sequences, cross-over study to evaluate the pharmacokinetic comparability of a different dose (900 
mg) of the deferasirox granules in comparison to the reference dispersible tablet formulation of 
deferasirox (1500 mg) under fasted conditions in healthy Japanese subjects. This part of the study is 
included in the present submission package for completeness. 
Patient exposure 
In Study F2104, 20 subjects were exposed to doses of 400 mg, 800 mg, and 1200 mg deferasirox 
granules and 1500 mg deferasirox dispersible tablet. Each subject received a single dose of each 
dosage in a specific sequence. One subject in this study missed the 800 mg and 1200 mg doses of 
granules due to a protocol deviation. 
In Study F2105, 41 subjects were exposed to doses of 1200 mg deferasirox granules and 1500 mg 
deferasirox dispersible tablet. Each subject received a single dose of each dosage in a specific 
sequence. 
In Study F2106, 48 subjects were exposed to three doses of 1200 mg deferasirox granules. 
In Study F1102-Part 1, 97 subjects were exposed to doses of 990 mg and 1080 mg deferasirox 
granules and 1500 mg deferasirox dispersible tablet. Each subject received a single dose of each 
dosage in a specific sequence. 
In Study F1102-Part 2, 95 subjects were exposed to doses of 900 mg deferasirox granules and 1500 
mg deferasirox dispersible tablet (one patient received 1500 mg DT, then discontinued). Each subject 
received a single dose of each dosage in a specific sequence. 
Adverse events 
The population in Studies F2104, F2105, F2106 and F1102-Part 1 and -Part 2 consisted of adult 
healthy volunteers. Safety assessments included monitoring and recording of all treatment-emergent 
adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), blood and urine laboratory monitoring and 
vital signs, physical examinations and ECGs. No other special safety evaluations were performed in 
these subjects. Treatment-emergent AEs were summarised and listed by system organ class (SOC) 
and preferred term. 
Adverse event data was coded using MedDRA Version 15 in Study F2104, Version 15.1 in Study F2106 
and Version 16 in Study F2105 and Version 16.1 in Study F1102, as those were the MedDRA versions 
valid when those studies started.

Given the half-life of deferasirox ranging from 8-16 hours and the 6-8 day wash-out between 
treatment periods, AEs in these cross-over trials are presented by ‘treatment arms’ as well as by ‘all 
subjects’. 
Common adverse events 
In Study F2104, the most reported AE was headache. 4 subjects (16.7%) experienced an event of 
headache assessed as mild and suspected to be related to study drug (400 mg granules, 1 subject; 
800 mg granules, 2 subjects; DT, 1 subject) (Table 14). One subject experienced the event twice in 
different treatment sequences (400 mg and 800 mg granules). In all patients, the duration of the 
event was 1 to 3 days, except in one subject where it lasted for seven days. No diarrhoea was 
reported. One subject experienced a mild urinary tract infection assessed as suspected to be related to 
study drug. The study medication was permanently discontinued due to administration of a prohibited 
drug. 
In Study F2105, subjects were treated with granules and DT. Two subjects in treatment B (1500 mg 
DT with water) experienced one event of diarrhoea. The other six single events occurred in five 
subjects in treatment A (1200 mg of deferasirox granules). Diarrhoea was the only reported AE with a 
suspected relationship to the study drug. No subject discontinued due to an AE. 
In Study F2106, one subject in Arm 1 treatment B (1200 mg granules with apple sauce) as well as one 
subject in Arm 2 treatment A (1200 mg granules with water) experienced an event of diarrhoea. In 
addition, 2 subjects had an event of dermatitis contact: one in treatment A, and another in treatment 
E (1200 mg granules with high-fat breakfast). The two subjects with dermatitis contact remained in 
the study. One subject in treatment D (1200 mg granules with low-fat breakfast) permanently 
discontinued study drug due to an AE (rash), which also led to administration of a prohibited 
concomitant medication (diphenhydramine). 
In Study F1102-Part 1, subjects received granules and DT. Twelve subjects (12.4%) had an event of 
diarrhoea, of which 6 subjects had more than one event (Table 17). The events occurred in different 
treatment groups and sequences (4 events on 990 mg granules, 9 events on 1080 mg granules, and 6 
events were on 1500 mg DT). All events were assessed as mild, and most AEs were suspected to be 
related to study drug. There were also increased alanine aminotransferase and aspartate 
aminotransferase (both 5.2%) (6 events on 990 mg granules, 2 events on 1080 mg granules, and 2 
events on 1500 mg DT) and increased eosinophil count (4.1%) (2 events on 990 mg granules and 2 
events on 1500 mg DT). Two subjects discontinued study treatment, one due to the AE increased 
AST/ALT (not suspected) and the second due to rash which was suspected to be associated with study 
drug. 
In Study F1102-Part 2, subjects were treated with granules and DT. The events diarrhoea and 
headache occurred with both the 900 mg granules and the deferasirox DT. Six subjects (6.3%) had an 
event of diarrhoea, of which 3 subjects experienced this more than once. These 9 events of diarrhoea 
occurred in different treatment groups and sequences (6 events on 900 mg granules and 3 events on 
1500 mg DT).  Three subjects experienced headache, 2 subjects on 1500 mg DT and 1 subject on 900 
mg granules. All events were mild in severity and suspected to be related to study drug. No subject 
discontinued due to an AE. Part 1 had 18 AEs (19%, N=97) on 1080 mg granules experienced by 14 
subjects and Part 2 had 8 AEs (8%, N=95) on 900 mg granules experienced by 8 subjects. (Of note, 
one patient discontinued in Part 2 and did not receive 900 mg.)  Events suspected to be drug-related. 
Study F2104: Gastrointestinal disorders was the most commonly observed AE; 7 subjects experienced 
an event suspected to be related to investigational product: 4 subjects (19.0%) on 400 mg deferasirox

granule, 2 subjects (10.0%) on 800 mg deferasirox granule, 1 subject (5.0%) on 1200 mg granule, 
and 2 subjects (9.5%) on the reference single dose of 1500 mg DT. Headache was the next most 
frequently reported AE with a suspected relationship to investigational product: 1 subject (4.8%) on 
400 mg granules, 2 subjects (10.0%) on 800 mg granules, no subjects on 1200 mg granules, and 1 
subject (4.8%) on DT, respectively. 
Study F2105: diarrhoea was the only reported AE with a suspected relationship to the study drug in 
one subject during treatment with 1500 mg DT. 
Study F2106: None of the reported AEs were assessed by the Investigator as suspected to be related 
to study drug, except for one AE (rash) of a subject on treatment D (single dose of 1200 mg 
deferasirox granules after a low-fat breakfast) in treatment sequence D/A/E. 
Study F1102: In Part 1, most of the AEs (20 of the 21 reported events; see Table 17) were suspected 
to be drug related. In Part 2, all AEs (see Table 18) were suspected to be drug related. 
Severity of AEs 
Study F2104: All TEAEs were mild in nature with almost all AEs requiring no action, except for a mild 
urinary tract infection and mild headache. 
Study F2105: All the reported TEAEs were mild in nature. 
Study F2106: Overall, the majority of AEs were mild in nature, except for syncope in one subject on 
treatment C (single dose of 1200 mg deferasirox granules with yogurt). It was assessed as moderate 
severity and unrelated to study medication. 
Study F1102: In both Part 1 and Part 2, all the reported TEAEs were mild in nature except one event of 
rash in Part 2 which was moderate. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In the five pharmacokinetic studies, no deaths occurred within 30 days of the last dose. 
In Study F2105, one subject who was not randomized and never received deferasirox, but did receive 
an iron supplement to counter potential loss of iron due to chelation, reported an SAE, abortion 
spontaneous. On 25-Sep-2013, an ultrasound showed she was 6 weeks pregnant. An elective abortion 
was scheduled for 16-Oct-2013, but vaginal bleeding began on 26-Sep-2013 and worsened on 29-Sep-
2013, when she went to the local emergency room. A pelvic exam, serum beta human chorionic 
gonadotropin, and ultrasound suggested that the subject was miscarrying. On 01-Oct-2013, she 
returned to the emergency room for increased vaginal bleeding and pain. Pelvic exam ultrasound 
identified a small amount of tissue present, and approximately 50% was removed by forceps under 
ultrasound guidance. On 02-Oct-2013, the subject fully recovered and was discharged home with 
instructions to follow-up with obstetrics/ gynaecology. The subject never received deferasirox, but did 
receive an iron supplement as part of the study. The Investigator did not suspect a relationship 
between the SAE and study drug (iron supplement). 
Laboratory findings 
There were no clinically significant findings observed for any of the haematology and clinical chemistry 
parameters during the studies.

Study F2106: One subject in Arm 2 permanently discontinued study drug due to mild AE (rash) which 
also led to administration of prohibited concomitant medication. 
The investigator suspected a relationship between the event (rash) and the study medication. 
Study F1102: 
In Part 1, two subjects had an AE leading to discontinuation of treatment. One subject experienced a 
mild form of rash (eruption) during treatment B (1080 mg granules), which was suspected to be 
related to study drug. Another subject experienced mild events of ALT and AST increased (>3x ULN) 
during treatment C (990 mg granules), which were not suspected to be related to study drug. The 
study drug was permanently discontinued. 
In Part 2, no subjects had an AE leading to discontinuation. 
Post marketing experience 
Considering the new formulation, post-marketing experience is only available for the film-coated tablet 
which has been approved in the USA on 30-Mar-2015 (NDA 206-910), in Canada on 24-Feb-2016 
(under the tradename Jadenu) and in the European Union on 22-March-2016 (under the tradename 
Exjade).  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Concerning the new granule formulation, supplement safety data were provided from clinical 
pharmacology trials carried on healthy subjects with a total of 301 subjects. No new safety signals 
have emerged from these studies. AEs in all subjects ranged from 11.5% in study F1102-Part 2 to 
41.7% in study F2104. The most commonly reported AE was diarrhoea. All TEAEs were mild in nature 
except one syncope assessed as moderate and unrelated to study medication (F2106) and one event 
of rash which was moderate (F1102 Part 2). No death occurred within 30 days of the last dose. Data 
from these clinical pharmacology studies could not demonstrate the safety profile of the new granule 
formulation as these studies were not carried out in the target population. 
This application is a line extension to the existing marketing authorisation for Exjade 125 mg, 250 mg 
and 500 mg dispersible tablets and Exjade 90 mg, 180 mg and 360 mg film coated tablets. The 
granules and FCT contain the same compendial excipients in the same proportions. The only difference 
in content between the forms (FCT and granules) is the coating material used for the FCT, which is 
absent from the granules. In the previous X/0043 application, quality data have been generated to 
confirm that the FCT can be crushed and administered by sprinkling the full dose onto soft food, e.g. 
yogurt or apple sauce. 
The AUC of deferasirox granules at 1080 mg was equivalent to that of the DT at 1500 mg, based on 
the bioequivalence criteria of [80-125%]. The mean peak concentration of the granules was 34% 
Assessment report  
EMA/639290/2017 
Page 23/36 
  
  
higher than that of the DT. Based on a retrospective PKPD analysis in a large clinical trial in the target 
population, it appears that overall exposure (AUC) is the key parameter for assessing deferasirox 
safety and efficacy. Thus, the observed higher Cmax (with a similar AUC) with the granules 
formulation are not likely to result clinically in worsening creatinine laboratory values or in a significant 
change in serum ferritin from baseline.  
The safety of the FCT formulation of deferasirox was recently investigated in a head-to-head 
comparison in a limited number of patients in F2201 study in thalassemia and MDS. This study 
randomized 86 patients to DT and 87 patients to FCT treatment. Based on the results of the 24-week 
treatment period, both treatment arms showed a similar overall adverse event (AE) profile and no new 
safety signals emerged. The frequencies of serious adverse events were similar between each group 
(11.6 vs. 12.6%). The most common AEs on DT and FCT (>20% in either arm) were diarrhoea (34.9% 
vs. 33.3%), nausea (26.7% vs. 27.6%), abdominal pain (26.7 % vs. 26.4%), increased urine 
protein/creatinine ratio (12.8% vs. 20.7%) and vomiting (22.1% vs. 17.2%), respectively. AEs leading 
to study drug discontinuation were numerically similar between DT and FCT groups (7% vs. 5.7%). 
One death (febrile neutropenia in a 63-year-old patient with MDS) occurred during the treatment 
period; it was in the FCT group and not suspected to be related to study treatment. An imbalance 
between groups in the urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) increase was noted. This imbalance was 
further evaluated in the EMEA/H/C/000670/II/0052 procedure. 9/86 (10.5%) patients in the DT arm 
and 16/87(18.4%) in the FCT arm had normal UPCR at baseline (<=1 mg/mg) but reported at least 
one post baseline value of UPCR > 1 mg/mg post baseline. However, among these patients, only 2 
from DT and none in the FCT arm reported UPCR value of notable range (UPCR >1 mg/mg during 2 
consecutive visits). Mean durations of exposure to study drug in patients with at least one UPCR value 
above 1 mg/mg and/or proteinuria related adverse event were similar in both arms (171 days in the 
DT group and 160 days in the FCT groups, with a median of 169 days in both treatment arms). This AE 
was not severe with FCT and did not impact negatively the overall exposure to this formulation.  
‘Renal disorders’ are already considered an important identified risk in the RMP. The SmPC currently 
recommends extensive monitoring of renal parameters. These measures are considered sufficient to 
follow the risk of proteinuria. 
Considering the pharmacokinetic and quality equivalence of FCT and granule formulation, the CHMP 
considered that safety data of the granule formulation should be provided in study CICL670F2202, a 
randomized, open-label, multicenter, two arms, Phase II study allowing to evaluate safety of 
deferasirox granules in paediatric patients with iron overload.   
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Considering the pharmacokinetic and quality equivalence of FCT and granule formulation, the CHMP 
considered that the safety data of the FCT formulation provided from F2201 study are sufficient to 
document the tolerance profile of granule formulation. The safety of the new formulations (FCT and 
granules) is still identified as missing information in the submitted RMP. In addition, study 
CICL670F2202 has been added in the pharmacovigilance plan in order to evaluate the safety of the 
granules formulation in the paediatric indication.

this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Iron overload is the result of many disorders inducing an increased net entry of iron within the body 
and can lead per se to the development of organ damage and increased mortality. It can be classified 
as primary or secondary depending whether it results from a primary defect in the regulation of iron 
balance or is secondary to other genetic or acquired disorders. A known example of primary iron 
overload is hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC), in which iron is absorbed in excess because of 
increased iron transfer from the enteral cells to the blood. The secondary includes iron overload either 
due to, or associated with, ineffective erythropoiesis, chronic liver diseases, parenteral administration 
or ingestion of excessive amounts of iron. Thalassemia major and sideroblastic anemia are the two 
best studied examples of iron overload secondary to blood transfusions and ineffective erythropoiesis. 
Frequent blood transfusions lead to excessive accumulation of iron with a toxic accumulation in 3 to 10 
years. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The aim of treatment of iron storage disease is to remove from the body the excess iron that has 
accumulated. In the case of patients without primary disorders of haematopoiesis (i.e. primary 
haemochromatosis), this is best achieved by phlebotomy, since regeneration of erythrocytes by the 
marrow utilises iron, which is therefore withdrawn from various body pools. Phlebotomy is only 
occasionally feasible. Patients who have augmented iron stores because of ineffective erythropoiesis 
and those in whom the iron overload is the result of multiple transfusions require treatment with an 
iron chelating agent to achieve safe levels of body iron.  
Assessment report  
EMA/639290/2017 
Page 29/36 
  
  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The development program for granules includes a total of five clinical pharmacology studies in healthy 
adult subjects and an additional PK/PD investigation in patients diagnosed with transfusion- dependent 
iron overload, using a pharmacokinetic comparability approach. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
To improve palatability and patient compliance, the MAH developed a new formulation for oral 
administration, presented as two different dosage forms: granules packaged in sachets, and a film-
coated tablet (FCT). This application concerns the granules and is a line extension to the existing 
marketing authorisation for Exjade 125 mg, 250 mg and 500 mg dispersible tablets and Exjade 90 mg, 
180 mg and 360 mg film coated tablets. The granules and FCT contain the same compendial excipients 
in the same proportions. The only difference in content between the forms (FCT and granules) is the 
coating material used for the FCT, which is absent from the granules.  
Dispersible tablets administration requires the dispersion in high volume (100-250 ml) of liquid and 
must be taken on an empty stomach due to the substantial food effect. In the previous X/0043 
application, quality data have been generated to confirm that the FCT can be crushed and 
administered by sprinkling the full dose onto soft food, e.g. yogurt or apple sauce. The crushing of FCT 
facilitates administration for any patient with difficulty in swallowing whole tablets. The granule 
formulation provides administration advantages, because there is no requirement to manually crush 
the tablet.  
The PKs of the new deferasirox granule formulation has been sufficiently characterised in healthy 
volunteers. The new formulation is characterised by an improved bioavailability of about 30% and a 
reduced food effect than the reference marketed DT. The PK of the granules (AUC and Cmax) is dose 
proportional in the dose range of 400 to 1200 mg. The AUC of deferasirox granules at 1080 mg was 
equivalent to that of the DT at 1500 mg, based on the bioequivalence criteria of [80-125%]. However, 
the mean peak concentration of the granules was 34% higher than that of the DT. Based on a 
retrospective PK/PD analysis in a large clinical trial in the target population, it appears that overall 
exposure (AUC) is the key parameter for assessing deferasirox safety and efficacy. Thus, the observed 
higher Cmax (with a similar AUC) with the granules formulation are not likely to result clinically in 
worsening creatinine laboratory values or in a significant change in serum ferritin from baseline. 
Finally, systemic availability of the new granules formulation deferasirox under fed conditions was only 
slightly modified and the food effect is not expected to be clinically relevant. 
No specific data focussed on efficacy/activity were submitted as part of this application. This 
application cross-referred to the existing efficacy data generated with the dispersible tablet 
formulation.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
No specific data focussed on efficacy/activity were submitted as part of this application. However, as 
mentioned above, the CHMP consider that efficacy would probably not be affected by the observed 
Cmax differences.  
Assessment report  
EMA/639290/2017 
Page 30/36 
  
  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Considering the quality equivalence and similar pharmacokinetics of FCT and granule formulation, the 
MAH provided safety data of the FCT formulation provided from F2201 study. This randomized trial 
included 173 thalassemia and MDS patients. Over the 24-week treatment period, both treatment arms 
showed a similar overall adverse events profile and no new safety signals emerged. An imbalance 
between groups in the urine protein/creatinine ratio increase was noted (10.5% patients in DT arm 
and 18.4% in FCT arm had normal UPCR at baseline (<=1 mg/mg) but reported at least one post 
baseline value of UPCR > 1 mg/mg post baseline). However, this AE was not severe with FCT and did 
not impact negatively the overall exposure to this formulation. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Concerning the new granule formulation, supplement safety data were provided from clinical 
pharmacology trials carried out on healthy subjects with a total of 301 subjects. No new safety signals 
have emerged from these studies. AEs in all subjects ranged from 11.5% in study F1102-Part 2 to 
41.7% in study F2104. The most commonly reported AE was diarrhoea. All TEAEs were mild in nature 
except one syncope assessed as moderate and unrelated to study medication (F2106) and one event 
of rash which was moderate (F1102 Part 2). No death occurred within 30 days of the last dose. 
However, data from these clinical pharmacology studies could not demonstrate the safety profile of the 
new granule formulation as these studies were not carried out in the target population. Hence, the 
safety of the new formulations (FCT and granules) is still identified as missing information in the 
submitted RMP. In addition, study CICL670F2202 has been added in the pharmacovigilance plan in 
order to evaluate the safety of the granules formulation in the paediatric indication.  
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In addition to the FCT, the  granules are in favour of a better compliance than the DT form.  
The safety profile of the granules formulation has not been tested in the target population. However, 
considering quality equivalence and similar pharmacokinetics of FCT and granule formulation, the 
CHMP considers that the safety data of the FCT formulation provided from F2201 study are sufficient to 
document the safety of granule formulation. The safety of the new formulation (FCT and granules) is 
still identified as missing information in the submitted RMP. In addition, study CICL670F2202 has been 
added in the pharmacovigilance plan in order to evaluate the safety of the granules in the paediatric 
indication.  
Also, safety post marketing data of these new formulations should be updated in the forthcoming 
periodic safety update reports.  
Risk of error due to wrong dose is low as the granules and FCT contain the same compendial excipients 
in the same proportions and the granules are intended to be launched after FCT, at the time when DT 
will likely not be supplied in the respective countries any longer. For these reasons, it was considered 
that the educational materials for patients and physicians are sufficient to minimise the risk of 
medication error. The educational materials are updated to reflect the granule formulation.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality , safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of, Exjade new pharmaceutical form is favourable in the following 
indications: 
EXJADE is indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to frequent blood transfusions 
(≥7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) in patients with beta thalassaemia major aged 6 years and 
older. 
EXJADE is also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions when 
deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in the following patient groups: 
- 
- 
in paediatric patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to frequent blood 
transfusions (≥7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 to 5 years, 
in adult and paediatric patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to 
infrequent blood transfusions (<7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 years and 
older, 
- 
in adult and paediatric patients with other anaemias aged 2 years and older. 
EXJADE is also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload requiring chelation therapy when 
deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in patients with non-transfusion-dependent 
thalassaemia syndromes aged 10 years and older. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension of the marketing authorisation for Exjade subject to 
the following conditions:

Additional periodic distributions after launch should be performed, notably after substantial safety 
modifications of the product information justifying educational material updates. 
The MAH shall use distinct outer cartons, blisters and tablets for all formulations (dispersible tablets 
and film-coated tablets/granules). 
The physician educational material should contain: 
• 
The Summary of Product Characteristics 
•  Guide for healthcare professionals 
The Guide for healthcare professionals shall contain the following key elements: 
•  Description of available deferasirox formulations (e.g. dispersible tablets, film-coated tablets 
and granules) 
o  Different posology regimen 
o  Different conditions of administration 
• 
• 
• 
o  Dose conversion table when switching from one formulation to another 
The recommended doses and the rules for starting treatment 
The need to monitor serum ferritin monthly 
That deferasirox causes rises in serum creatinine in some patients 
o  The need to monitor serum creatinine 
•  On two occasions prior to initiation of treatment 
• 
Every week during the first month of initiation of treatment or after therapy 
modification 
•  Monthly thereafter 
o  The need to reduce by 10 mg/kg the dose if serum creatinine rises: 
•  Adults: >33% above baseline and creatinine clearance <LLN (90 ml/min) 
• 
Paediatrics: either >ULN or creatinine clearance falls to <LLN at two consecutive visits. 
o  The need to interrupt treatment after a dose reduction if serum creatinine rises:

•  Adults and Paediatrics: remain >33% above baseline or creatinine clearance <LLN 
(90 ml/min) 
o  The need to consider renal biopsy: 
•  When serum creatinine is elevated and if another abnormality has been detected (e.g. 
proteinuria, signs of Fanconi syndrome). 
• 
The importance of measuring creatinine clearance 
•  Brief overview of methods of measuring creatinine clearance 
• 
That rises in serum transaminases may occur in patients treated with EXJADE 
o  The need for liver function tests prior to prescription, then at monthly intervals or more 
often if clinically indicated 
o  Not to prescribe to patients with pre-existing severe hepatic disease 
o  The need to interrupt treatment if persistent and progressive increase in liver enzyme were 
noted. 
• 
• 
The need for annual auditory and ophthalmic testing 
The need for a guidance table highlighting pre-treatment measurements of serum creatinine, 
creatinine clearance, proteinuria, hepatic enzymes, ferritin, such as: 
Before initiating treatment 
Serum creatinine at Day - X 
Serum creatinine at Day - Y 
X and Y are the days (to be determined) when pre-treatment measurements should be performed. 
Value 1 
Value 2 
•  Recommendations for treatment of non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia (NTDT) 
syndromes: 
o 
Information that only one course of treatment is proposed for NTDT patients 
o  The recommended doses and the rules for starting treatment 
o  The rules for stopping when target liver iron concentration and serum ferritin are reached 
o  A warning to minimise the risk of over-chelation 
o  A warning on the necessity of closer monitoring of liver iron concentration and serum 
ferritin in the paediatric population 
o  A warning on the currently unknown safety consequences of long-term treatment in the 
paediatric population 
Prior to launch of deferasirox film-coated tablets, healthcare professionals will receive introductory 
notification letters as follows: 
• 
• 
Pharmacists - a detailed letter explaining the switch between formulations 
Prescribers - a letter including the following dossiers: 
o  A prescribers’ guide informing about the switch between formulations in order to address 
the important potential risk of medication error for deferasirox 
Assessment report  
EMA/639290/2017 
Page 35/36 
  
  
 
 
o  A patient’s guide informing about the possibility of co-existing formulations in the EU 
market, and the differences concerning their administration, in order to address the 
important potential risk of medication error for deferasirox 
Additionally, prescribers and pharmacists will be informed via a specific letter regarding the timelines 
for removing EXJADE dispersible tablets from the EU market. 
The patient information pack should contain: 
• 
• 
Patient information leaflet 
Patient guide 
Patient guide should contain the following key elements: 
o 
o 
Information on the need for regular monitoring, and when it should be carried out, of 
serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, proteinuria, hepatic enzymes, ferritin 
Information that renal biopsy may be considered if significant renal abnormalities occur 
o  Availability of several oral formulations (e.g. dispersible tablets, film-coated tablets and 
granules) and the main differences associated with these formulations (i.e., different 
posology regimen, different conditions of administration notably with food). 
Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures 
The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures:

Non-interventional post-authorisation safety study (PASS): In order to assess the 
June 2021 
long-term exposure and safety of deferasirox dispersible and film-coated tablets, the 
MAH should conduct an observational cohort study in paediatric 
non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia patients over 10 years old for whom 
deferoxamine is contraindicated or inadequate conducted according to a CHMP-agreed 
protocol. The clinical study report should be submitted by 
Interventional post-authorisation safety study (PASS): In order to assess the safety of 
June 2021 
deferasirox film-coated tablets in the paediatric population (especially when the tablets 
are crushed), the MAH shall conduct and submit the results of a safety study conducted 
according to an agreed protocol. The clinical study report should be submitted by

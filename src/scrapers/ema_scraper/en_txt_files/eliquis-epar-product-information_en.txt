Clinical particulars 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Prevention of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in adult patients who have undergone elective hip 
or knee replacement surgery. 
Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation 
(NVAF), with one or more risk factors, such as prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA); age 
≥ 75 years; hypertension; diabetes mellitus; symptomatic heart failure (NYHA Class ≥ II). 
Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent 
DVT and PE in adults (see section 4.4 for haemodynamically unstable PE patients). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Prevention of VTE (VTEp): elective hip or knee replacement surgery 
The recommended dose of apixaban is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily. The initial dose should be 
taken 12 to 24 hours after surgery. 
Physicians may consider the potential benefits of earlier anticoagulation for VTE prophylaxis as well 
as the risks of post-surgical bleeding in deciding on the time of administration within this time 
window. 
In patients undergoing hip replacement surgery 
The recommended duration of treatment is 32 to 38 days. 
In patients undergoing knee replacement surgery 
The recommended duration of treatment is 10 to 14 days. 
Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) 
The recommended dose of apixaban is 5 mg taken orally twice daily.

Dose reduction 
The recommended dose of apixaban is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily in patients with NVAF and at 
least two of the following characteristics: age ≥ 80 years, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine 
≥ 1.5 mg/dL (133 micromole/L). 
Therapy should be continued long-term. 
Treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTEt) 
The recommended dose of apixaban for the treatment of acute DVT and treatment of PE is 10 mg 
taken orally twice daily for the first 7 days followed by 5 mg taken orally twice daily. As per available 
medical guidelines, short duration of treatment (at least 3 months) should be based on transient risk 
factors (e.g., recent surgery, trauma, immobilisation). 
The recommended dose of apixaban for the prevention of recurrent DVT and PE is 2.5 mg taken orally 
twice daily. When prevention of recurrent DVT and PE is indicated, the 2.5 mg twice daily dose 
should be initiated following completion of 6 months of treatment with apixaban 5 mg twice daily or 
with another anticoagulant, as indicated in Table 1 below (see also section 5.1).

The duration of overall therapy should be individualised after careful assessment of the treatment 
benefit against the risk for bleeding (see section 4.4). 
Missed dose 
If a dose is missed, the patient should take Eliquis immediately and then continue with twice daily 
intake as before. 
Switching 
Switching treatment from parenteral anticoagulants to Eliquis (and vice versa) can be done at the next 
scheduled dose (see section 4.5). These medicinal products should not be administered 
simultaneously. 
Switching from vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy to Eliquis 
When converting patients from vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy to Eliquis, warfarin or other 
VKA therapy should be discontinued and Eliquis started when the international normalised ratio (INR) 
is < 2. 
Switching from Eliquis to VKA therapy 
When converting patients from Eliquis to VKA therapy, administration of Eliquis should be continued 
for at least 2 days after beginning VKA therapy. After 2 days of coadministration of Eliquis with VKA 
therapy, an INR should be obtained prior to the next scheduled dose of Eliquis. Coadministration of 
Eliquis and VKA therapy should be continued until the INR is ≥ 2. 
Elderly 
VTEp and VTEt – No dose adjustment required (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
NVAF – No dose adjustment required, unless criteria for dose reduction are met (see Dose reduction 
at the beginning of section 4.2).

Renal impairment 
In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment, the following recommendations apply: 
- 
- 
for the prevention of VTE in elective hip or knee replacement surgery (VTEp), for the treatment 
of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTEt), no dose adjustment 
is necessary (see section 5.2). 
for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF and serum creatinine 
≥ 1.5 mg/dL (133 micromole/L) associated with age ≥ 80 years or body weight ≤ 60 kg, a dose 
reduction is necessary and described above. In the absence of other criteria for dose reduction 
(age, body weight), no dose adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2). 
In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 mL/min) the following 
recommendations apply (see sections 4.4 and 5.2): 
- 
- 
for the prevention of VTE in elective hip or knee replacement surgery (VTEp), for the treatment 
of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTEt) apixaban is to be 
used with caution; 
for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF, patients should 
receive the lower dose of apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily. 
In patients with creatinine clearance < 15 mL/min, or in patients undergoing dialysis, there is no 
clinical experience therefore apixaban is not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Eliquis is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically 
relevant bleeding risk (see section 4.3). 
It is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4. and 5.2). 
It should be used with caution in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A or 
B). No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Patients with elevated liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) >2 x ULN or total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 x ULN were excluded in clinical studies. Therefore Eliquis 
should be used with caution in this population (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Prior to initiating Eliquis, 
liver function testing should be performed. 
Body weight 
VTEp and VTEt - No dose adjustment required (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
NVAF - No dose adjustment required, unless criteria for dose reduction are met (see Dose reduction at 
the beginning of section 4.2). 
Gender 
No dose adjustment required (see section 5.2). 
Patients undergoing catheter ablation (NVAF) 
Patients can continue apixaban use while undergoing catheter ablation (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5). 
Patients undergoing cardioversion 
Apixaban can be initiated or continued in NVAF patients who may require cardioversion. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For patients not previously treated with anticoagulants, exclusion of left atrial thrombus using an 
image guided approach (e.g. transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) or computed tomographic scan 
(CT)) prior to cardioversion should be considered, in accordance with established medical guidelines. 
For patients initiating treatment with apixaban, 5 mg should be given twice daily for at least 2.5 days 
(5 single doses) before cardioversion to ensure adequate anticoagulation (see section 5.1). The dosing 
regimen should be reduced to 2.5 mg apixaban given twice daily for at least 2.5 days (5 single doses) 
if the patient meets the criteria for dose reduction (see above sections Dose reduction and Renal 
impairment). 
If cardioversion is required before 5 doses of apixaban can be administered, a 10 mg loading dose 
should be given, followed by 5 mg twice daily. The dosing regimen should be reduced to a 5 mg 
loading dose followed by 2.5 mg twice daily if the patient meets the criteria for dose reduction (see 
above sections Dose reduction and Renal impairment). The administration of the loading dose should 
be given at least 2 hours before cardioversion (see section 5.1). 
For all patients undergoing cardioversion, confirmation should be sought prior to cardioversion that 
the patient has taken apixaban as prescribed. Decisions on initiation and duration of treatment should 
take established guideline recommendations for anticoagulant treatment in patients undergoing 
cardioversion into account. 
Patients with NVAF and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and/or percutaneous coronary intervention 
(PCI) 
There is limited experience of treatment with apixaban at the recommended dose for NVAF patients 
when used in combination with antiplatelet agents in patients with ACS and/or undergoing PCI after 
haemostasis is achieved (see sections 4.4, 5.1). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Eliquis in children and adolescents below age 18 have not been established. 
Currently available data on thromboembolism prevention are described in section 5.1 but no 
recommendation on a posology can be made. 
Method of administration 
Oral use 
Eliquis should be swallowed with water, with or without food. 
For patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Eliquis tablets may be crushed and suspended in 
water, or 5% glucose in water (G5W), or apple juice or mixed with apple puree and immediately 
administered orally (see section 5.2). Alternatively, Eliquis tablets may be crushed and suspended in 
60 mL of water or G5W and immediately delivered through a nasogastric tube (see section 5.2). 
Crushed Eliquis tablets are stable in water, G5W, apple juice, and apple puree for up to 4 hours. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Active clinically significant bleeding. 
Hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk (see 
section 5.2). 
Lesion or condition if considered a significant risk factor for major bleeding. This may include 
current or recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of 
bleeding, recent brain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent 
intracranial haemorrhage, known or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous 
malformations, vascular aneurysms or major intraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities. 
Concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulant agent e.g., unfractionated heparin (UFH), 
low molecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin, etc.), heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, 
etc.), oral anticoagulants (warfarin, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, etc.) except under specific 
circumstances of switching anticoagulant therapy (see section 4.2), when UFH is given at doses 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
necessary to maintain an open central venous or arterial catheter or when UFH is given during 
catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Haemorrhage risk 
As with other anticoagulants, patients taking apixaban are to be carefully observed for signs of 
bleeding. It is recommended to be used with caution in conditions with increased risk of haemorrhage. 
Apixaban administration should be discontinued if severe haemorrhage occurs (see sections 4.8 and 
4.9). 
Although treatment with apixaban does not require routine monitoring of exposure, a calibrated 
quantitative anti-Factor Xa assay may be useful in exceptional situations where knowledge of 
apixaban exposure may help to inform clinical decisions, e.g., overdose and emergency surgery (see 
section 5.1). 
An agent to reverse the anti-factor Xa activity of apixaban is available. 
Interaction with other medicinal products affecting haemostasis 
Due to an increased bleeding risk, concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
The concomitant use of apixaban with antiplatelet agents increases the risk of bleeding (see 
section 4.5). 
Care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
(SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs), including acetylsalicylic acid. 
Following surgery, other platelet aggregation inhibitors are not recommended concomitantly with 
apixaban (see section 4.5). 
In patients with atrial fibrillation and conditions that warrant mono or dual antiplatelet therapy, a 
careful assessment of the potential benefits against the potential risks should be made before 
combining this therapy with apixaban. 
In a clinical study of patients with atrial fibrillation, concomitant use of ASA increased the major 
bleeding risk on apixaban from 1.8% per year to 3.4% per year and increased the bleeding risk on 
warfarin from 2.7% per year to 4.6% per year. In this clinical study, there was limited (2.1%) use of 
concomitant dual antiplatelet therapy (see section 5.1). 
A clinical study enrolled patients with atrial fibrillation with ACS and/or undergoing PCI and a 
planned treatment period with a P2Y12 inhibitor, with or without ASA, and oral anticoagulant (either 
apixaban or VKA) for 6 months. Concomitant use of ASA increased the risk of ISTH (International 
Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis) major or CRNM (Clinically Relevant Non-Major) bleeding in 
apixaban-treated subjects from 16.4% per year to 33.1% per year (see section 5.1). 
In a clinical study of high-risk post acute coronary syndrome patients without atrial fibrillation, 
characterised by multiple cardiac and non-cardiac comorbidities, who received ASA or the 
combination of ASA and clopidogrel, a significant increase in risk of ISTH major bleeding was 
reported for apixaban (5.13% per year) compared to placebo (2.04% per year). 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Use of thrombolytic agents for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke 
There is very limited experience with the use of thrombolytic agents for the treatment of acute 
ischemic stroke in patients administered apixaban (see section 4.5). 
Patients with prosthetic heart valves 
Safety and efficacy of apixaban have not been studied in patients with prosthetic heart valves, with or 
without atrial fibrillation. Therefore, the use of apixaban is not recommended in this setting. 
Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome 
Direct acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) including apixaban are not recommended for patients 
with a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular for 
patients that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-beta 
2-glycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates of 
recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy. 
Surgery and invasive procedures 
Apixaban should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures 
with a moderate or high risk of bleeding. This includes interventions for which the probability of 
clinically significant bleeding cannot be excluded or for which the risk of bleeding would be 
unacceptable. 
Apixaban should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures 
with a low risk of bleeding. This includes interventions for which any bleeding that occurs is expected 
to be minimal, non-critical in its location or easily controlled. 
If surgery or invasive procedures cannot be delayed, appropriate caution should be exercised, taking 
into consideration an increased risk of bleeding. This risk of bleeding should be weighed against the 
urgency of intervention. 
Apixaban should be restarted after the invasive procedure or surgical intervention as soon as possible 
provided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has been established (for cardioversion 
see section 4.2). 
For patients undergoing catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation, apixaban treatment does not need to be 
interrupted (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.5). 
Temporary discontinuation 
Discontinuing anticoagulants, including apixaban, for active bleeding, elective surgery, or invasive 
procedures places patients at an increased risk of thrombosis. Lapses in therapy should be avoided and 
if anticoagulation with apixaban must be temporarily discontinued for any reason, therapy should be 
restarted as soon as possible. 
Spinal/epidural anaesthesia or puncture 
When neuraxial anaesthesia (spinal/epidural anaesthesia) or spinal/epidural puncture is employed, 
patients treated with antithrombotic agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk 
of developing an epidural or spinal haematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis. 
The risk of these events may be increased by the post-operative use of indwelling epidural catheters or 
the concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis. Indwelling epidural or intrathecal 
catheters must be removed at least 5 hours prior to the first dose of apixaban. The risk may also be 
increased by traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. Patients are to be frequently monitored 
for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment (e.g., numbness or weakness of the legs, bowel or 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
bladder dysfunction). If neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is 
necessary. Prior to neuraxial intervention the physician should consider the potential benefit versus the 
risk in anticoagulated patients or in patients to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis. 
There is no clinical experience with the use of apixaban with indwelling intrathecal or epidural 
catheters. In case there is such need and based on the general PK characteristics of apixaban, a time 
interval of 20-30 hours (i.e., 2 x half-life) between the last dose of apixaban and catheter withdrawal 
should elapse, and at least one dose should be omitted before catheter withdrawal. The next dose of 
apixaban may be given at least 5 hours after catheter removal. As with all new anticoagulant medicinal 
products, experience with neuraxial blockade is limited and extreme caution is therefore recommended 
when using apixaban in the presence of neuraxial blockade. 
Haemodynamically unstable PE patients or patients who require thrombolysis or pulmonary 
embolectomy 
Apixaban is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin in patients with pulmonary 
embolism who are haemodynamically unstable or may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary 
embolectomy since the safety and efficacy of apixaban have not been established in these clinical 
situations. 
Patients with active cancer 
Patients with active cancer can be at high risk of both venous thromboembolism and bleeding events. 
When apixaban is considered for DVT or PE treatment in cancer patients, a careful assessment of the 
benefits against the risks should be made (see also section 4.3). 
Patients with renal impairment 
Limited clinical data indicate that apixaban plasma concentrations are increased in patients with severe 
renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 mL/min) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk. 
For the prevention of VTE in elective hip or knee replacement surgery (VTEp), the treatment of DVT, 
treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTEt), apixaban is to be used with caution 
in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 mL/min) (see sections 4.2 and 
5.2). 
For the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF, patients with severe renal 
impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 mL/min), and patients with serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL 
(133 micromole/L) associated with age ≥ 80 years or body weight ≤ 60 kg should receive the lower 
dose of apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily (see section 4.2). 
In patients with creatinine clearance < 15 mL/min, or in patients undergoing dialysis, there is no 
clinical experience therefore apixaban is not recommended (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Elderly patients 
Increasing age may increase haemorrhagic risk (see section 5.2). 
Also, the coadministration of apixaban with ASA in elderly patients should be used cautiously because 
of a potentially higher bleeding risk. 
Body weight 
Low body weight (< 60 kg) may increase haemorrhagic risk (see section 5.2). 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
Apixaban is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and 
clinically relevant bleeding risk (see section 4.3). 
It is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
It should be used with caution in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A or 
B) (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Patients with elevated liver enzymes ALT/AST > 2 x ULN or total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 x ULN were 
excluded in clinical studies. Therefore apixaban should be used cautiously in this population (see 
section 5.2). Prior to initiating apixaban, liver function testing should be performed. 
Interaction with inhibitors of both cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) 
The use of apixaban is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with 
strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, such as azole-antimycotics (e.g., ketoconazole, 
itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole) and HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir). These 
medicinal products may increase apixaban exposure by 2-fold (see section 4.5), or greater in the 
presence of additional factors that increase apixaban exposure (e.g., severe renal impairment). 
Interaction with inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp 
The concomitant use of apixaban with strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, 
carbamazepine, phenobarbital or St. John’s Wort) may lead to a ~50% reduction in apixaban exposure. 
In a clinical study in atrial fibrillation patients, diminished efficacy and a higher risk of bleeding were 
observed with coadministration of apixaban with strong inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp compared 
with using apixaban alone. 
In patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with strong inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp 
the following recommendations apply (see section 4.5): 
- 
- 
for the prevention of VTE in elective hip or knee replacement surgery, for the prevention of 
stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF and for the prevention of recurrent DVT 
and PE, apixaban should be used with caution; 
for the treatment of DVT and treatment of PE, apixaban should not be used since efficacy may 
be compromised. 
Hip fracture surgery 
Apixaban has not been studied in clinical studies in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery to 
evaluate efficacy and safety in these patients. Therefore, it is not recommended in these patients. 
Laboratory parameters 
Clotting tests [e.g., prothrombin time (PT), INR, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)] are 
affected as expected by the mechanism of action of apixaban. Changes observed in these clotting tests 
at the expected therapeutic dose are small and subject to a high degree of variability (see section 5.1). 
Information about excipients 
Eliquis contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase 
deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
"sodium-free".

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp 
Coadministration of apixaban with ketoconazole (400 mg once a day), a strong inhibitor of both 
CYP3A4 and P-gp, led to a 2-fold increase in mean apixaban AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in mean 
apixaban Cmax. 
The use of apixaban is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with 
strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, such as azole-antimycotics (e.g., ketoconazole, 
itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole) and HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) (see 
section 4.4). 
Active substances which are not considered strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, (e.g., 
amiodarone, clarithromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, naproxen, quinidine, verapamil) are expected to 
increase apixaban plasma concentration to a lesser extent. No dose adjustment for apixaban is required 
when coadministered with agents that are not strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp. For 
example, diltiazem (360 mg once a day), considered a moderate CYP3A4 and a weak P-gp inhibitor, 
led to a 1.4-fold increase in mean apixaban AUC and a 1.3-fold increase in Cmax. Naproxen (500 mg, 
single dose) an inhibitor of P-gp but not an inhibitor of CYP3A4, led to a 1.5-fold and 1.6-fold 
increase in mean apixaban AUC and Cmax, respectively. Clarithromycin (500 mg, twice a day), an 
inhibitor of P-gp and a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, led to a 1.6-fold and 1.3-fold increase in mean 
apixaban AUC and Cmax respectively. 
Inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp 
Coadministration of apixaban with rifampicin, a strong inducer of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, led to an 
approximate 54% and 42% decrease in mean apixaban AUC and Cmax, respectively. The concomitant 
use of apixaban with other strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, 
phenobarbital or St. John’s Wort) may also lead to reduced apixaban plasma concentrations. No dose 
adjustment for apixaban is required during concomitant therapy with such medicinal products, 
however in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with strong inducers of both CYP3A4 
and P-gp apixaban should be used with caution for the prevention of VTE in elective hip or knee 
replacement surgery, for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF and 
for the prevention of recurrent DVT and PE. 
Apixaban is not recommended for the treatment of DVT and PE in patients receiving concomitant 
systemic treatment with strong inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp since efficacy may be 
compromised (see section 4.4). 
Anticoagulants, platelet aggregation inhibitors, SSRIs/SNRIs and NSAIDs 
Due to an increased bleeding risk, concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants is 
contraindicated except under specific circumstances of switching anticoagulant therapy, when UFH is 
given at doses necessary to maintain an open central venous or arterial catheter or when UFH is given 
during catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (see section 4.3). 
After combined administration of enoxaparin (40 mg single dose) with apixaban (5 mg single dose), 
an additive effect on anti-Factor Xa activity was observed. 
Pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were not evident when apixaban was 
coadministered with ASA 325 mg once a day. 
Apixaban coadministered with clopidogrel (75 mg once a day) or with the combination of clopidogrel 
75 mg and ASA 162 mg once daily, or with prasugrel (60 mg followed by 10 mg once daily) in 
Phase I studies did not show a relevant increase in template bleeding time, or further inhibition of 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
platelet aggregation, compared to administration of the antiplatelet agents without apixaban. Increases 
in clotting tests (PT, INR, and aPTT) were consistent with the effects of apixaban alone. 
Naproxen (500 mg), an inhibitor of P-gp, led to a 1.5-fold and 1.6-fold increase in mean apixaban 
AUC and Cmax, respectively. Corresponding increases in clotting tests were observed for apixaban. No 
changes were observed in the effect of naproxen on arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation and 
no clinically relevant prolongation of bleeding time was observed after concomitant administration of 
apixaban and naproxen. 
Despite these findings, there may be individuals with a more pronounced pharmacodynamic response 
when antiplatelet agents are coadministered with apixaban. Apixaban should be used with caution 
when coadministered with SSRIs/SNRIs, NSAIDs, ASA and/or P2Y12 inhibitors because these 
medicinal products typically increase the bleeding risk (see section 4.4). 
There is limited experience of co-administration with other platelet aggregation inhibitors (such as 
GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonists, dipyridamole, dextran or sulfinpyrazone) or thrombolytic agents. As 
such agents increase the bleeding risk, co-administration of these medicinal products with apixaban is 
not recommended (see section 4.4). 
Other concomitant therapies 
No clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when 
apixaban was coadministered with atenolol or famotidine. Coadministration of apixaban 10 mg with 
atenolol 100 mg did not have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of apixaban. 
Following administration of the two medicinal products together, mean apixaban AUC and Cmax were 
15% and 18% lower than when administered alone. The administration of apixaban 10 mg with 
famotidine 40 mg had no effect on apixaban AUC or Cmax. 
Effect of apixaban on other medicinal products 
In vitro apixaban studies showed no inhibitory effect on the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 (IC50 > 45 μM) and weak inhibitory effect on the activity 
of CYP2C19 (IC50 > 20 μM) at concentrations that are significantly greater than peak plasma 
concentrations observed in patients. Apixaban did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP3A4/5 at a 
concentration up to 20 μM. Therefore, apixaban is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of 
coadministered medicinal products that are metabolised by these enzymes. Apixaban is not a 
significant inhibitor of P-gp. 
In studies conducted in healthy subjects, as described below, apixaban did not meaningfully alter the 
pharmacokinetics of digoxin, naproxen, or atenolol. 
Digoxin 
Coadministration of apixaban (20 mg once a day) and digoxin (0.25 mg once a day), a P-gp substrate, 
did not affect digoxin AUC or Cmax. Therefore, apixaban does not inhibit P-gp mediated substrate 
transport. 
Naproxen 
Coadministration of single doses of apixaban (10 mg) and naproxen (500 mg), a commonly used 
NSAID, did not have any effect on the naproxen AUC or Cmax. 
Atenolol 
Coadministration of a single dose of apixaban (10 mg) and atenolol (100 mg), a common beta-blocker, 
did not alter the pharmacokinetics of atenolol. 
Activated charcoal 
Administration of activated charcoal reduces apixaban exposure (see section 4.9).

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of apixaban in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct 
or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary 
measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of apixaban during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether apixaban or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available data in 
animals have shown excretion of apixaban in milk (see section 5.3). A risk to the suckling child cannot 
be excluded. 
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from 
apixaban therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of 
therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
Studies in animals dosed with apixaban have shown no effect on fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Eliquis has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety of apixaban has been investigated in 7 Phase III clinical studies including more than 
21,000 patients: more than 5,000 patients in VTEp studies, more than 11,000 patients in NVAF studies 
and more than 4,000 patients in the VTE treatment (VTEt) studies, for an average total exposure of 
20 days, 1.7 years and 221 days respectively (see section 5.1). 
Common adverse reactions were haemorrhage, contusion, epistaxis, and haematoma (see Table 2 for 
adverse reaction profile and frequencies by indication). 
In the VTEp studies, in total, 11% of the patients treated with apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily experienced 
adverse reactions. The overall incidence of adverse reactions related to bleeding with apixaban was 
10% in the apixaban vs enoxaparin studies. 
In the NVAF studies, the overall incidence of adverse reactions related to bleeding with apixaban was 
24.3% in the apixaban vs warfarin study and 9.6% in the apixaban vs acetylsalicylic acid study. In the 
apixaban vs warfarin study the incidence of ISTH major gastrointestinal bleeds (including upper GI, 
lower GI, and rectal bleeding) with apixaban was 0.76%/year. The incidence of ISTH major 
intraocular bleeding with apixaban was 0.18%/year. 
In the VTEt studies, the overall incidence of adverse reactions related to bleeding with apixaban was 
15.6% in the apixaban vs enoxaparin/warfarin study and 13.3% in the apixaban vs placebo study (see 
section 5.1).

* There were no occurrences of generalised pruritus in CV185057 (long term prevention of VTE) 
† The term “Brain haemorrhage” encompasses all intracranial or intraspinal haemorrhages (i.e., haemorrhagic stroke or 
putamen, cerebellar, intraventricular, or subdural haemorrhages).

The use of apixaban may be associated with an increased risk of occult or overt bleeding from any 
tissue or organ, which may result in posthaemorrhagic anaemia. The signs, symptoms, and severity 
will vary according to the location and degree or extent of the bleeding (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Overdose of apixaban may result in a higher risk of bleeding. In the event of haemorrhagic 
complications, treatment must be discontinued and the source of bleeding investigated. The initiation 
of appropriate treatment, e.g., surgical haemostasis, the transfusion of fresh frozen plasma or the 
administration of a reversal agent for factor Xa inhibitors should be considered. 
In controlled clinical studies, orally-administered apixaban in healthy subjects at doses up to 50 mg 
daily for 3 to 7 days (25 mg twice daily (bid) for 7 days or 50 mg once daily (od) for 3 days) had no 
clinically relevant adverse reactions. 
In healthy subjects, administration of activated charcoal 2 and 6 hours after ingestion of a 20 mg dose 
of apixaban reduced mean apixaban AUC by 50% and 27%, respectively, and had no impact on Cmax. 
Mean half-life of apixaban decreased from 13.4 hours when apixaban was administered alone to 
5.3 hours and 4.9 hours, respectively, when activated charcoal was administered 2 and 6 hours after 
apixaban. Thus, administration of activated charcoal may be useful in the management of apixaban 
overdose or accidental ingestion. 
For situations when reversal of anticoagulation is needed due to life-threatening or uncontrolled 
bleeding, a reversal agent for factor Xa inhibitors is available (see section 4.4). Administration of 
prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) or recombinant factor VIIa may also be considered. 
Reversal of apixaban pharmacodynamic effects, as demonstrated by changes in the thrombin 
generation assay, was evident at the end of infusion and reached baseline values within 4 hours after 
the start of a 4-factor PCC 30 minute infusion in healthy subjects. However, there is no clinical 
experience with the use of 4-factor PCC products to reverse bleeding in individuals who have received 
apixaban. Currently there is no experience with the use of recombinant factor VIIa in individuals 
receiving apixaban. Re-dosing of recombinant factor VIIa could be considered and titrated depending 
on improvement of bleeding. 
Depending on local availability, a consultation of a coagulation expert should be considered in case of 
major bleedings. 
Haemodialysis decreased apixaban AUC by 14% in subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), 
when a single dose of apixaban 5 mg was administered orally. Therefore, haemodialysis is unlikely to 
be an effective means of managing apixaban overdose.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, direct factor Xa inhibitors, ATC code: B01AF02 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mechanism of action 
Apixaban is a potent, oral, reversible, direct and highly selective active site inhibitor of factor Xa. It 
does not require antithrombin III for antithrombotic activity. Apixaban inhibits free and clot-bound 
factor Xa, and prothrombinase activity. Apixaban has no direct effects on platelet aggregation, but 
indirectly inhibits platelet aggregation induced by thrombin. By inhibiting factor Xa, apixaban 
prevents thrombin generation and thrombus development. Preclinical studies of apixaban in animal 
models have demonstrated antithrombotic efficacy in the prevention of arterial and venous thrombosis 
at doses that preserved haemostasis. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
The pharmacodynamic effects of apixaban are reflective of the mechanism of action (FXa inhibition). 
As a result of FXa inhibition, apixaban prolongs clotting tests such as prothrombin time (PT), INR and 
activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Changes observed in these clotting tests at the expected 
therapeutic dose are small and subject to a high degree of variability. They are not recommended to 
assess the pharmacodynamic effects of apixaban. In the thrombin generation assay, apixaban reduced 
endogenous thrombin potential, a measure of thrombin generation in human plasma. 
Apixaban also demonstrates anti-Factor Xa activity as evident by reduction in Factor Xa enzyme 
activity in multiple commercial anti-Factor Xa kits, however results differ across kits. Data from 
clinical studies are only available for the Rotachrom® Heparin chromogenic assay. Anti-Factor Xa 
activity exhibits a close direct linear relationship with apixaban plasma concentration, reaching 
maximum values at the time of apixaban peak plasma concentrations. The relationship between 
apixaban plasma concentration and anti-Factor Xa activity is approximately linear over a wide dose 
range of apixaban. 
Table 3 below shows the predicted steady state exposure and anti-Factor Xa activity for each 
indication. In patients taking apixaban for the prevention of VTE following hip or knee replacement 
surgery, the results demonstrate a less than 1.6-fold fluctuation in peak-to-trough levels. In 
non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients taking apixaban for the prevention of stroke and systemic 
embolism, the results demonstrate a less than 1.7-fold fluctuation in peak-to-trough levels. In patients 
taking apixaban for the treatment of DVT and PE or prevention of recurrent DVT and PE, the results 
demonstrate a less than 2.2-fold fluctuation in peak-to-trough levels.

Although treatment with apixaban does not require routine monitoring of exposure, a calibrated 
quantitative anti-Factor Xa assay may be useful in exceptional situations where knowledge of 
apixaban exposure may help to inform clinical decisions, e.g., overdose and emergency surgery. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Prevention of VTE (VTEp): elective hip or knee replacement surgery 
The apixaban clinical program was designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of apixaban for the 
prevention of VTE in a broad range of adult patients undergoing elective hip or knee replacement. A 
total of 8,464 patients were randomised in two pivotal, double-blind, multi-national studies, comparing 
apixaban 2.5 mg given orally twice daily (4,236 patients) or enoxaparin 40 mg once daily 
(4,228 patients). Included in this total were 1,262 patients (618 in the apixaban group) of age 75 or 
older, 1,004 patients (499 in the apixaban group) with low body weight (≤ 60 kg), 1,495 patients 
(743 in the apixaban group) with BMI ≥ 33 kg/m2, and 415 patients (203 in the apixaban group) with 
moderate renal impairment. 
The ADVANCE-3 study included 5,407 patients undergoing elective hip replacement, and the 
ADVANCE-2 study included 3,057 patients undergoing elective knee replacement. Subjects received 
either apixaban 2.5 mg given orally twice daily (po bid) or enoxaparin 40 mg administered 
subcutaneously once daily (sc od). The first dose of apixaban was given 12 to 24 hours post-surgery, 
whereas enoxaparin was started 9 to 15 hours prior to surgery. Both apixaban and enoxaparin were 
given for 32-38 days in the ADVANCE-3 study and for 10-14 days in the ADVANCE-2 study. 
Based on patient medical history in the studied population of ADVANCE-3 and ADVANCE-2 
(8,464 patients), 46% had hypertension, 10% had hyperlipidemia, 9% had diabetes, and 8% had 
coronary artery disease. 
Apixaban demonstrated a statistically superior reduction in the primary endpoint, a composite of all 
VTE/all cause death, and in the Major VTE endpoint, a composite of proximal DVT, non-fatal PE, and 
VTE-related death, compared to enoxaparin in both elective hip or knee replacement surgery (see 
Table 4).

2 Includes events occurring after first dose of apixaban (post-surgery) 
The overall incidences of adverse reactions of bleeding, anaemia and abnormalities of transaminases 
(e.g., ALT levels) were numerically lower in patients on apixaban compared to enoxaparin in the 
phase II and phase III studies in elective hip and knee replacement surgery. 
In the knee replacement surgery study during the intended treatment period, in the apixaban arm 
4 cases of PE were diagnosed against no cases in the enoxaparin arm. No explanation can be given to 
this higher number of PE. 
Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) 
A total of 23,799 patients were randomised in the clinical program (ARISTOTLE: apixaban versus 
warfarin, AVERROES: apixaban versus ASA) including 11,927 randomised to apixaban. The program 
was designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of apixaban for the prevention of stroke and 
systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and one or more additional 
risk factors, such as: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) 
age ≥ 75 years 
hypertension 
diabetes mellitus 
symptomatic heart failure (NYHA Class ≥ II) 
ARISTOTLE study 
In the ARISTOTLE study a total of 18,201 patients were randomised to double-blind treatment with 
apixaban 5 mg twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily in selected patients [4.7%], see section 4.2) or 
warfarin (target INR range 2.0-3.0), patients were exposed to study active substance for a mean of 
20 months. The mean age was 69.1 years, the mean CHADS2 score was 2.1 and 18.9% of patients had 
prior stroke or TIA. 
In the study, apixaban achieved statistically significant superiority in the primary endpoint of 
prevention of stroke (haemorrhagic or ischaemic) and systemic embolism (see Table 6) compared with 
warfarin.

For patients randomised to warfarin, the median percentage of time in therapeutic range (TTR) 
(INR 2-3) was 66%. 
Apixaban showed a reduction of stroke and systemic embolism compared to warfarin across the 
different levels of center TTR; within the highest quartile of TTR according to center, the hazard ratio 
for apixaban vs warfarin was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.38, 1.40). 
Key secondary endpoints of major bleeding and all cause death were tested in a pre-specified 
hierarchical testing strategy to control the overall type 1 error in the trial. Statistically significant 
superiority was also achieved in the key secondary endpoints of both major bleeding and all-cause 
death (see Table 7). With improving monitoring of INR the observed benefits of apixaban compared to 
warfarin regarding all cause death diminish.

The overall discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 1.8% for apixaban and 2.6% for warfarin 
in the ARISTOTLE study. 
The efficacy results for prespecified subgroups, including CHADS2 score, age, body weight, gender, 
status of renal function, prior stroke or TIA and diabetes were consistent with the primary efficacy 
results for the overall population studied in the trial. 
The incidence of ISTH major gastrointestinal bleeds (including upper GI, lower GI, and rectal 
bleeding) was 0.76%/year with apixaban and 0.86%/year with warfarin.

AVERROES study 
In the AVERROES study a total of 5,598 patients considered to be unsuitable for VKA by the 
investigators were randomised to treatment with apixaban 5 mg twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily in 
selected patients [6.4%], see section 4.2) or ASA. ASA was given at a once daily dose of 81 mg 
(64%), 162 (26.9%), 243 (2.1%), or 324 mg (6.6%) at the discretion of the investigator. Patients were 
exposed to study active substance for a mean of 14 months. The mean age was 69.9 years, the mean 
CHADS2 score was 2.0 and 13.6% of patients had prior stroke or TIA. 
Common reasons for unsuitability for VKA therapy in the AVERROES study included 
unable/unlikely to obtain INRs at requested intervals (42.6%), patient refused treatment with VKA 
(37.4%), CHADS2 score = 1 and physician did not recommend VKA (21.3%), patient could not be 
relied on to adhere to VKA medicinal product instruction (15.0%), and difficulty/expected difficulty in 
contacting patient in case of urgent dose change (11.7%). 
AVERROES was stopped early based on a recommendation by the independent Data Monitoring 
Committee due to clear evidence of reduction of stroke and systemic embolism with an acceptable 
safety profile. 
The overall discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 1.5% for apixaban and 1.3% for ASA in 
the AVERROES study. 
In the study, apixaban achieved statistically significant superiority in the primary endpoint of 
prevention of stroke (haemorrhagic, ischaemic or unspecified) or systemic embolism (see Table 8) 
compared to ASA.

NVAF patients with ACS and/or undergoing PCI 
AUGUSTUS, an open-label, randomised, controlled, 2 by 2 factorial design trial, enrolled 
4614 patients with NVAF who had ACS (43%) and/or underwent PCI (56%). All patients received 
background therapy with a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel: 90.3%) prescribed per local standard of care. 
Patients were randomised up to 14 days after the ACS and/or PCI to either apixaban 5 mg twice daily 
(2.5 mg twice daily if two or more of the dose-reduction criteria were met; 4.2% received lower dose) 
or VKA and to either ASA (81 mg once daily) or placebo. The mean age was 69.9 years, 94% of 
patients randomised had a CHA2DS2-VASc score > 2, and 47% had a HAS-BLED score > 3. For 
patients randomised to VKA, the proportion of time in therapeutic range (TTR) (INR 2-3) was 56%, 
with 32% of time below TTR and 12% above TTR. 
The primary objective of AUGUSTUS was to assess safety, with a primary endpoint of ISTH major or 
CRNM bleeding. In the apixaban versus VKA comparison, the primary safety endpoint of ISTH major 
or CRNM bleeding at month 6 occurred in 241 (10.5%), and 332 (14.7%) patients in the apixaban arm 
and in the VKA arm respectively (HR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.58, 0.82; 2-sided p < 0.0001 for non 
inferiority and p < 0.0001 for superiority). For VKA, additional analyses using subgroups by TTR 
showed that the highest rate of bleeding was associated with the lowest quartile of TTR. The rate of 
bleeding was similar between apixaban and the highest quartile of TTR. 
In the ASA versus placebo comparison, the primary safety endpoint of ISTH major or CRNM 
bleeding at month 6 occurred in 367 (16.1%), and 204 (9.0%) patients in the ASA arm and in the 
placebo arm respectively (HR = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.58, 2.23; two-sided p < 0.0001). 
Specifically, in apixaban-treated patients, major or CRNM bleeding occurred in 157 (13.7%), and 84 
(7.4%) patients in the ASA arm and in the placebo arm respectively. In VKA-treated patients, major or 
CRNM bleeding occurred in 208 (18.5%), and 122 (10.8%) patients in the ASA arm and in the 
placebo arm respectively. 
Other treatment effects were evaluated as a secondary objective of the study, with composite 
endpoints. 
In the apixaban versus VKA comparison, the composite endpoint of death or re-hospitalisation 
occurred in 541 (23.5%) and 632 (27.4%) patients in the apixaban and in the VKA arm, respectively. 
The composite endpoint of death or ischemic event (stroke, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis or 
urgent revascularisation) occurred in 170 (7.4%), and 182 (7.9%) patients in the apixaban and in the 
VKA arm, respectively. 
In the ASA versus placebo comparison, the composite endpoint of death or re-hospitalisation occurred 
in 604 (26.2%) and 569 (24.7%) patients in the ASA and in the placebo arm, respectively. The 
composite endpoint of death or ischemic event (stroke, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis or 
urgent revascularisation) occurred in 163 (7.1%), and 189 (8.2%) patients in the ASA and in the 
placebo arm, respectively.

Patients undergoing cardioversion 
EMANATE, an open-label, multi-center study, enrolled 1500 patients who were either oral 
anticoagulant naïve or pre-treated less than 48 hours, and scheduled for cardioversion for NVAF. 
Patients were randomised 1:1 to apixaban or to heparin and/or VKA for the prevention of 
cardiovascular events. Electrical and/or pharmacologic cardioversion was conducted after at least 
5 doses of 5 mg twice daily apixaban (or 2.5 mg twice daily in selected patients (see section 4.2)) or at 
least 2 hours after a 10 mg loading dose (or a 5 mg loading dose in selected patients (see section 4.2)) 
if earlier cardioversion was required. In the apixaban group, 342 patients received a loading dose 
(331 patients received the 10 mg dose and 11 patients received the 5 mg dose). 
There were no strokes (0%) in the apixaban group (n = 753) and 6 (0.80%) strokes in the heparin 
and/or VKA group (n = 747; RR 0.00, 95% CI 0.00, 0.64). All-cause death occurred in 2 patients 
(0.27%) in the apixaban group and 1 patient (0.13%) in the heparin and/or VKA group. No systemic 
embolism events were reported. 
Major bleeding and CRNM bleeding events occurred in 3 (0.41%) and 11 (1.50%) patients, 
respectively, in the apixaban group, compared to 6 (0.83%) and 13 (1.80%) patients in the heparin 
and/or VKA group. 
This exploratory study showed comparable efficacy and safety between apixaban and heparin and/or 
VKA treatment groups in the setting of cardioversion. 
Treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTEt) 
The clinical program (AMPLIFY: apixaban versus enoxaparin/warfarin, AMPLIFY-EXT: apixaban 
versus placebo) was designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of apixaban for the treatment of 
DVT and/or PE (AMPLIFY), and extended therapy for the prevention of recurrent DVT and/or PE 
following 6 to 12 months of anticoagulant treatment for DVT and/or PE (AMPLIFY-EXT). Both 
studies were randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, multinational trials in patients with 
symptomatic proximal DVT or symptomatic PE. All the key safety and efficacy endpoints were 
adjudicated by an independent blinded committee. 
AMPLIFY study 
In the AMPLIFY study a total of 5,395 patients were randomised to treatment with apixaban 10 mg 
twice daily orally for 7 days followed by apixaban 5 mg twice daily orally for 6 months, or enoxaparin 
1 mg/kg twice daily subcutaneously for at least 5 days (until INR≥ 2) and warfarin (target INR range 
2.0-3.0) orally for 6 months. 
The mean age was 56.9 years and 89.8% of randomised patients had unprovoked VTE events. 
For patients randomised to warfarin, the mean percentage of time in therapeutic range (INR 2.0-3.0) 
was 60.9. Apixaban showed a reduction in recurrent symptomatic VTE or VTE-related death across 
the different levels of center TTR; within the highest quartile of TTR according to center, the relative 
risk for apixaban vs enoxaparin/warfarin was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.39, 1.61). 
In the study, apixaban was shown to be non-inferior to enoxaparin/warfarin in the combined primary 
endpoint of adjudicated recurrent symptomatic VTE (nonfatal DVT or nonfatal PE) or VTE-related 
death (see Table 10).

Apixaban efficacy in initial treatment of VTE was consistent between patients who were treated for a 
PE [Relative Risk 0.9; 95% CI (0.5, 1.6)] or DVT [Relative Risk 0.8; 95% CI (0.5, 1.3)]. Efficacy across 
subgroups, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), renal function, extent of index PE, location 
of DVT thrombus, and prior parenteral heparin use was generally consistent. 
The primary safety endpoint was major bleeding. In the study, apixaban was statistically superior to 
enoxaparin/warfarin in the primary safety endpoint [Relative Risk 0.31, 95% confidence interval (0.17, 
0.55), P-value < 0.0001] (see Table 11).

The adjudicated major bleeding and CRNM bleeding at any anatomical site were generally lower in 
the apixaban group as compared to the enoxaparin/warfarin group. Adjudicated ISTH major 
gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in 6 (0.2%) apixaban-treated patients and 17 (0.6%) 
enoxaparin/warfarin-treated patients. 
AMPLIFY-EXT study 
In the AMPLIFY-EXT study a total of 2,482 patients were randomised to treatment with apixaban 
2.5 mg twice daily orally, apixaban 5 mg twice daily orally, or placebo for 12 months after completing 
6 to 12 months of initial anticoagulant treatment. Of these, 836 patients (33.7%) participated in the 
AMPLIFY study prior to enrollment in the AMPLIFY-EXT study. 
The mean age was 56.7 years and 91.7% of randomised patients had unprovoked VTE events. 
In the study, both doses of apixaban were statistically superior to placebo in the primary endpoint of 
symptomatic, recurrent VTE (nonfatal DVT or nonfatal PE) or all-cause death (see Table 12).

Apixaban efficacy for prevention of a recurrence of a VTE was maintained across subgroups, including 
age, gender, BMI, and renal function. 
The primary safety endpoint was major bleeding during the treatment period. In the study, the incidence 
in major bleeding for both apixaban doses was not statistically different from placebo. There was no 
statistically significant difference in the incidence of major + CRNM, minor, and all bleeding between

Prevention of VTE in paediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or lymphoblastic

In the PREVAPIX-ALL study, a total of 512 patients age ≥ 1 to < 18 with newly diagnosed ALL or 
LL, undergoing induction chemotherapy including asparaginase via an indwelling central venous 
access device, were randomised 1:1 to open-label thromboprophylaxis with apixaban or standard of 
care (with no systemic anticoagulation). Apixaban was administered according to a fixed-dose, body 
weight-tiered regimen designed to produce exposures comparable to those seen in adults who received 
2.5 mg twice daily (see Table 14). Apixaban was provided as a 2.5 mg tablet, 0.5 mg tablet, or 
0.4 mg/mL oral solution. The median duration of exposure in the apixaban arm was 25 days.

The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of adjudicated symptomatic and asymptomatic non-
fatal deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, and venous 
thromboembolism-related death. The incidence of the primary efficacy endpoint was 31 (12.1%) in the 
apixaban arm versus 45 (17.6%) in the standard of care arm. The relative risk reduction did not 
achieve significance. 
Safety endpoints were adjudicated according to ISTH criteria. The primary safety endpoint, major 
bleeding, occurred in 0.8% of patients in each treatment arm. CRNM bleeding occurred in 11 patients 
(4.3%) in the apixaban arm and 3 patients (1.2%) in the standard of care arm. The most common 
CRNM bleeding event contributing to the treatment difference was mild to moderate intensity 
epistaxis. Minor bleeding events occurred in 37 patients in the apixaban arm (14.5%) and 20 patients 
(7.8%) in the standard of care arm. 
Prevention of thromboembolism (TE) in paediatric patients with congenital or acquired heart disease 
SAXOPHONE was a randomised 2:1 open-label, multi-center comparative study of patients 28 days 
to < 18 years of age with congenital or acquired heart disease who require anticoagulation. Patients 
received either apixaban or standard of care thromboprophylaxis with a vitamin K antagonist or low 
molecular weight heparin. Apixaban was administered according to a fixed-dose, body weight-tiered 
regimen designed to produce exposures comparable to those seen in adults who received a dose of 
5 mg twice daily (see Table 15). Apixaban was provided as a 5 mg tablet, 0.5 mg tablet, or 0.4 mg/mL 
oral solution. The mean duration of exposure in the apixaban arm was 331 days.

The primary safety endpoint, a composite of adjudicated ISTH defined major and CRNM bleeding, 
occurred in 1 (0.8%) of 126 patients in the apixaban arm and 3 (4.8%) of 62 patients in the standard of 
care arm. The secondary safety endpoints of adjudicated major, CRNM, and all bleeding events were 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
similar in incidence across the two treatment arms. The secondary safety endpoint of drug 
discontinuation due to adverse event, intolerability, or bleeding was reported in 7 (5.6%) subjects in 
the apixaban arm and 1 (1.6%) subject in the standard of care arm. No patients in either treatment arm 
experienced a thromboembolic event. There were no deaths in either treatment arm. 
This study was prospectively designed for descriptive efficacy and safety because of the expected low 
incidence of TE and bleeding events in this population. Due to the observed low incidence of TE in 
this study a definitive risk benefit assessment could not be established. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies for the 
treatment of venous thromboembolism with Eliquis in one or more subsets of the paediatric population 
(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
The absolute bioavailability of apixaban is approximately 50% for doses up to 10 mg. Apixaban is 
rapidly absorbed with maximum concentrations (Cmax) appearing 3 to 4 hours after tablet intake. Intake 
with food does not affect apixaban AUC or Cmax at the 10 mg dose. Apixaban can be taken with or 
without food. 
Apixaban demonstrates linear pharmacokinetics with dose proportional increases in exposure for oral 
doses up to 10 mg. At doses ≥ 25 mg apixaban displays dissolution limited absorption with decreased 
bioavailability. Apixaban exposure parameters exhibit low to moderate variability reflected by a 
within-subject and inter-subject variability of ~20% CV and ~30% CV, respectively. 
Following oral administration of 10 mg of apixaban as 2 crushed 5 mg tablets suspended in 30 mL of 
water, exposure was comparable to exposure after oral administration of 2 whole 5 mg tablets. 
Following oral administration of 10 mg of apixaban as 2 crushed 5 mg tablets with 30 g of apple 
puree, the Cmax and AUC were 21% and 16% lower, respectively, when compared to administration of 
2 whole 5 mg tablets. The reduction in exposure is not considered clinically relevant. 
Following administration of a crushed 5 mg apixaban tablet suspended in 60 mL of G5W and 
delivered via a nasogastric tube, exposure was similar to exposure seen in other clinical studies 
involving healthy subjects receiving a single oral 5 mg apixaban tablet dose. 
Given the predictable, dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile of apixaban, the bioavailability 
results from the conducted studies are applicable to lower apixaban doses. 
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding in humans is approximately 87%. The volume of distribution (Vss) is 
approximately 21 litres. 
Biotransformation and elimination 
Apixaban has multiple routes of elimination. Of the administered apixaban dose in humans, 
approximately 25% was recovered as metabolites, with the majority recovered in faeces. Renal 
excretion of apixaban accounts for approximately 27% of total clearance. Additional contributions 
from biliary and direct intestinal excretion were observed in clinical and nonclinical studies, 
respectively. 
Apixaban has a total clearance of about 3.3 L/h and a half-life of approximately 12 hours. 
O-demethylation and hydroxylation at the 3-oxopiperidinyl moiety are the major sites of 
biotransformation. Apixaban is metabolised mainly via CYP3A4/5 with minor contributions from 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2J2. Unchanged apixaban is the major active substance-related 
component in human plasma with no active circulating metabolites present. Apixaban is a substrate of 
transport proteins, P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). 
Elderly 
Elderly patients (above 65 years) exhibited higher plasma concentrations than younger patients, with 
mean AUC values being approximately 32% higher and no difference in Cmax. 
Renal impairment 
There was no impact of impaired renal function on peak concentration of apixaban. There was an 
increase in apixaban exposure correlated to decrease in renal function, as assessed via measured 
creatinine clearance. In individuals with mild (creatinine clearance 51-80 mL/min), moderate 
(creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min) and severe (creatinine clearance 15-29 mL/min) renal 
impairment, apixaban plasma concentrations (AUC) were increased 16, 29, and 44% respectively, 
compared to individuals with normal creatinine clearance. Renal impairment had no evident effect on 
the relationship between apixaban plasma concentration and anti-Factor Xa activity. 
In subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the AUC of apixaban was increased by 36% when a 
single dose of apixaban 5 mg was administered immediately after haemodialysis, compared to that 
seen in subjects with normal renal function. Haemodialysis, started two hours after administration of a 
single dose of apixaban 5 mg, decreased apixaban AUC by 14% in these ESRD subjects, 
corresponding to an apixaban dialysis clearance of 18 mL/min. Therefore, haemodialysis is unlikely to 
be an effective means of managing apixaban overdose. 
Hepatic impairment 
In a study comparing 8 subjects with mild hepatic impairment, Child-Pugh A score 5 (n = 6) and 
score 6 (n = 2), and 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, Child-Pugh B score 7 (n = 6) and 
score 8 (n = 2), to 16 healthy control subjects, the single-dose pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of apixaban 5 mg were not altered in subjects with hepatic impairment. Changes in 
anti-Factor Xa activity and INR were comparable between subjects with mild to moderate hepatic 
impairment and healthy subjects. 
Gender 
Exposure to apixaban was approximately 18% higher in females than in males. 
Ethnic origin and race 
The results across phase I studies showed no discernible difference in apixaban pharmacokinetics 
between White/Caucasian, Asian and Black/African American subjects. Findings from a population 
pharmacokinetic analysis in patients who received apixaban were generally consistent with the phase I 
results. 
Body weight 
Compared to apixaban exposure in subjects with body weight of 65 to 85 kg, body weight > 120 kg 
was associated with approximately 30% lower exposure and body weight < 50 kg was associated with 
approximately 30% higher exposure. 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship 
The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship between apixaban plasma concentration 
and several PD endpoints (anti-Factor Xa activity, INR, PT, aPTT) has been evaluated after 
administration of a wide range of doses (0.5 – 50 mg). The relationship between apixaban plasma 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
concentration and anti-Factor Xa activity was best described by a linear model. The PK/PD 
relationship observed in patients was consistent with that established in healthy subjects. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Preclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, fertility and embryo-foetal 
development and juvenile toxicity. 
The major observed effects in the repeated dose toxicity studies were those related to the 
pharmacodynamic action of apixaban on blood coagulation parameters. In the toxicity studies little to 
no increase of bleeding tendency was found. However, since this may be due to a lower sensitivity of 
the non-clinical species compared to humans, this result should be interpreted with caution when 
extrapolating to humans. 
In rat milk, a high milk to maternal plasma ratio (Cmax about 8, AUC about 30) was found, possibly 
due to active transport into the milk.

Clinical particulars 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation 
(NVAF), with one or more risk factors, such as prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA); 
age≥ 75 years; hypertension; diabetes mellitus; symptomatic heart failure (NYHA Class ≥ II). 
Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent 
DVT and PE in adults (see section 4.4 for haemodynamically unstable PE patients). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) 
The recommended dose of apixaban is 5 mg taken orally twice daily. 
Dose reduction 
The recommended dose of apixaban is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily in patients with NVAF and at 
least two of the following characteristics: age ≥ 80 years, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine 
≥ 1.5 mg/dL (133 micromole/L). 
Therapy should be continued long-term. 
Treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTEt) 
The recommended dose of apixaban for the treatment of acute DVT and treatment of PE is 10 mg 
taken orally twice daily for the first 7 days followed by 5 mg taken orally twice daily. As per available 
medical guidelines, short duration of treatment (at least 3 months) should be based on transient risk 
factors (e.g., recent surgery, trauma, immobilisation). 
The recommended dose of apixaban for the prevention of recurrent DVT and PE is 2.5 mg taken orally 
twice daily. When prevention of recurrent DVT and PE is indicated, the 2.5 mg twice daily dose 
should be initiated following completion of 6 months of treatment with apixaban 5 mg twice daily or 
with another anticoagulant, as indicated in Table 1 below (see also section 5.1)

The duration of overall therapy should be individualised after careful assessment of the treatment 
benefit against the risk for bleeding (see section 4.4). 
Missed dose 
If a dose is missed, the patient should take Eliquis immediately and then continue with twice daily 
intake as before. 
Switching 
Switching treatment from parenteral anticoagulants to Eliquis (and vice versa) can be done at the next 
scheduled dose (see section 4.5). These medicinal products should not be administered 
simultaneously. 
Switching from vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy to Eliquis 
When converting patients from vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy to Eliquis, warfarin or other 
VKA therapy should be discontinued and Eliquis started when the international normalised ratio (INR) 
is < 2. 
Switching from Eliquis to VKA therapy 
When converting patients from Eliquis to VKA therapy, administration of Eliquis should be continued 
for at least 2 days after beginning VKA therapy. After 2 days of coadministration of Eliquis with VKA 
therapy, an INR should be obtained prior to the next scheduled dose of Eliquis. Coadministration of 
Eliquis and VKA therapy should be continued until the INR is ≥ 2. 
Elderly 
VTEt - No dose adjustment required (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
NVAF - No dose adjustment required, unless criteria for dose reduction are met (see Dose reduction at 
the beginning of section 4.2). 
Renal impairment 
In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment, the following recommendations apply: 
- 
- 
for the treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTEt), no 
dose adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2). 
for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF and serum creatinine 
≥ 1.5 mg/dL (133 micromole/L) associated with age ≥ 80 years or body weight ≤ 60 kg, a dose 
reduction is necessary and described above. In the absence of other criteria for dose reduction 
(age, body weight), no dose adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2). 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 mL/min) the following 
recommendations apply (see sections 4.4 and 5.2): 
- 
- 
for the treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTEt) 
apixaban is to be used with caution; 
for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF, patients should 
receive the lower dose of apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily. 
In patients with creatinine clearance < 15 mL/min, or in patients undergoing dialysis, there is no 
clinical experience therefore apixaban is not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Eliquis is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically 
relevant bleeding risk (see section 4.3). 
It is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4. and 5.2). 
It should be used with caution in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A or 
B). No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment 
(see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Patients with elevated liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) >2 x ULN or total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 x ULN were excluded in clinical studies. Therefore Eliquis 
should be used with caution in this population (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Prior to initiating Eliquis, 
liver function testing should be performed. 
Body weight 
VTEt - No dose adjustment required (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
NVAF - No dose adjustment required, unless criteria for dose reduction are met (see Dose reduction at 
the beginning of section 4.2). 
Gender 
No dose adjustment required (see section 5.2). 
Patients undergoing catheter ablation (NVAF) 
Patients can continue apixaban use while undergoing catheter ablation (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5). 
Patients undergoing cardioversion 
Apixaban can be initiated or continued in NVAF patients who may require cardioversion. 
For patients not previously treated with anticoagulants, exclusion of left atrial thrombus using an 
image guided approach (e.g. transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) or computed tomographic scan 
(CT)) prior to cardioversion should be considered, in accordance with established medical guidelines. 
For patients initiating treatment with apixaban, 5 mg should be given twice daily for at least 2.5 days 
(5 single doses) before cardioversion to ensure adequate anticoagulation (see section 5.1). The dosing 
regimen should be reduced to 2.5 mg apixaban given twice daily for at least 2.5 days (5 single doses) 
if the patient meets the criteria for dose reduction (see above sections Dose reduction and Renal 
impairment). 
If cardioversion is required before 5 doses of apixaban can be administered, a 10 mg loading dose 
should be given, followed by 5 mg twice daily. The dosing regimen should be reduced to a 5 mg 
loading dose followed by 2.5 mg twice daily if the patient meets the criteria for dose reduction (see 
above sections Dose reduction and Renal impairment). The administration of the loading dose should 
be given at least 2 hours before cardioversion (see section 5.1). 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For all patients undergoing cardioversion, confirmation should be sought prior to cardioversion that 
the patient has taken apixaban as prescribed. Decisions on initiation and duration of treatment should 
take established guideline recommendations for anticoagulant treatment in patients undergoing 
cardioversion into account. 
Patients with NVAF and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and/or percutaneous coronary intervention 
(PCI) 
There is limited experience of treatment with apixaban at the recommended dose for NVAF patients 
when used in combination with antiplatelet agents in patients with ACS and/or undergoing PCI after 
haemostasis is achieved (see sections 4.4, 5.1). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Eliquis in children and adolescents below age 18 have not been established. 
Currently available data on thromboembolism prevention are described in section 5.1 but no 
recommendation on a posology can be made. 
Method of administration 
Oral use 
Eliquis should be swallowed with water, with or without food. 
For patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Eliquis tablets may be crushed and suspended in 
water, or 5% glucose in water (G5W), or apple juice or mixed with apple puree and immediately 
administered orally (see section 5.2). Alternatively, Eliquis tablets may be crushed and suspended in 
60 mL of water or G5W and immediately delivered through a nasogastric tube (see section 5.2). 
Crushed Eliquis tablets are stable in water, G5W, apple juice, and apple puree for up to 4 hours. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Active clinically significant bleeding. 
Hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk (see 
section 5.2). 
Lesion or condition if considered a significant risk factor for major bleeding. This may include 
current or recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of 
bleeding, recent brain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent 
intracranial haemorrhage, known or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous 
malformations, vascular aneurysms or major intraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities. 
Concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulant agent e.g., unfractionated heparin (UFH), 
low molecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin, etc.), heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, 
etc.), oral anticoagulants (warfarin, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, etc.) except under specific 
circumstances of switching anticoagulant therapy (see section 4.2), when UFH is given at doses 
necessary to maintain an open central venous or arterial catheter or when UFH is given during 
catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Haemorrhage risk 
As with other anticoagulants, patients taking apixaban are to be carefully observed for signs of 
bleeding. It is recommended to be used with caution in conditions with increased risk of haemorrhage. 
Apixaban administration should be discontinued if severe haemorrhage occurs (see sections 4.8 and 
4.9). 
Although treatment with apixaban does not require routine monitoring of exposure, a calibrated 
quantitative anti-Factor Xa assay may be useful in exceptional situations where knowledge of 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
apixaban exposure may help to inform clinical decisions, e.g., overdose and emergency surgery (see 
section 5.1). 
An agent to reverse the anti-factor Xa activity of apixaban is available. 
Interaction with other medicinal products affecting haemostasis 
Due to an increased bleeding risk, concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
The concomitant use of apixaban with antiplatelet agents increases the risk of bleeding (see 
section 4.5). 
Care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
(SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs), including acetylsalicylic acid. 
Following surgery, other platelet aggregation inhibitors are not recommended concomitantly with 
apixaban (see section 4.5). 
In patients with atrial fibrillation and conditions that warrant mono or dual antiplatelet therapy, a 
careful assessment of the potential benefits against the potential risks should be made before 
combining this therapy with Eliquis. 
In a clinical study of patients with atrial fibrillation, concomitant use of ASA increased the major 
bleeding risk on apixaban from 1.8% per year to 3.4% per year and increased the bleeding risk on 
warfarin from 2.7% per year to 4.6% per year. In this clinical study, there was limited (2.1%) use of 
concomitant dual antiplatelet therapy (see section 5.1). 
A clinical study enrolled patients with atrial fibrillation with ACS and/or undergoing PCI and a 
planned treatment period with a P2Y12 inhibitor, with or without ASA, and oral anticoagulant (either 
apixaban or VKA) for 6 months. Concomitant use of ASA increased the risk of ISTH (International 
Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis) major or CRNM (Clinically Relevant Non-Major) bleeding in 
apixaban-treated subjects from 16.4% per year to 33.1% per year (see section 5.1). 
In a clinical study of high-risk post acute coronary syndrome patients without atrial fibrillation, 
characterised by multiple cardiac and non-cardiac comorbidities, who received ASA or the 
combination of ASA and clopidogrel, a significant increase in risk of ISTH major bleeding was 
reported for apixaban (5.13% per year) compared to placebo (2.04% per year). 
Use of thrombolytic agents for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke 
There is very limited experience with the use of thrombolytic agents for the treatment of acute 
ischemic stroke in patients administered apixaban (see section 4.5). 
Patients with prosthetic heart valves 
Safety and efficacy of apixaban have not been studied in patients with prosthetic heart valves, with or 
without atrial fibrillation. Therefore, the use of apixaban is not recommended in this setting. 
Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome 
Direct acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) including apixaban are not recommended for patients 
with a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular for 
patients that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-beta 
2-glycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates of 
recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy. 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Surgery and invasive procedures 
Apixaban should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures 
with a moderate or high risk of bleeding. This includes interventions for which the probability of 
clinically significant bleeding cannot be excluded or for which the risk of bleeding would be 
unacceptable. 
Apixaban should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures 
with a low risk of bleeding. This includes interventions for which any bleeding that occurs is expected 
to be minimal, non-critical in its location or easily controlled. 
If surgery or invasive procedures cannot be delayed, appropriate caution should be exercised, taking 
into consideration an increased risk of bleeding. This risk of bleeding should be weighed against the 
urgency of intervention. 
Apixaban should be restarted after the invasive procedure or surgical intervention as soon as possible 
provided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has been established (for cardioversion 
see section 4.2). 
For patients undergoing catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation, apixaban treatment does not need to be 
interrupted (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.5). 
Temporary discontinuation 
Discontinuing anticoagulants, including apixaban, for active bleeding, elective surgery, or invasive 
procedures places patients at an increased risk of thrombosis. Lapses in therapy should be avoided and 
if anticoagulation with apixaban must be temporarily discontinued for any reason, therapy should be 
restarted as soon as possible. 
Haemodynamically unstable PE patients or patients who require thrombolysis or pulmonary 
embolectomy 
Apixaban is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin in patients with pulmonary 
embolism who are haemodynamically unstable or may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary 
embolectomy since the safety and efficacy of apixaban have not been established in these clinical 
situations. 
Patients with active cancer 
Patients with active cancer can be at high risk of both venous thromboembolism and bleeding events. 
When apixaban is considered for DVT or PE treatment in cancer patients, a careful assessment of the 
benefits against the risks should be made (see also section 4.3). 
Patients with renal impairment 
Limited clinical data indicate that apixaban plasma concentrations are increased in patients with severe 
renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 mL/min) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk. 
For the treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTEt), apixaban 
is to be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
15-29 mL/min) (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
For the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF, patients with severe renal 
impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 mL/min), and patients with serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL 
(133 micromole/L) associated with age ≥ 80 years or body weight ≤ 60 kg should receive the lower 
dose of apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily (see section 4.2); 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In patients with creatinine clearance < 15 mL/min, or in patients undergoing dialysis, there is no 
clinical experience therefore apixaban is not recommended (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Elderly patients 
Increasing age may increase haemorrhagic risk (see section 5.2). 
Also, the co-administration of apixaban with ASA in elderly patients should be used cautiously 
because of a potentially higher bleeding risk. 
Body weight 
Low body weight (< 60 kg) may increase haemorrhagic risk (see section 5.2). 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
Apixaban is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and 
clinically relevant bleeding risk (see section 4.3). 
It is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
It should be used with caution in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A or 
B) (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Patients with elevated liver enzymes ALT/AST > 2 x ULN or total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 x ULN were 
excluded in clinical studies. Therefore apixaban should be used cautiously in this population (see 
section 5.2). Prior to initiating apixaban, liver function testing should be performed. 
Interaction with inhibitors of both cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) 
The use of apixaban is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with 
strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, such as azole-antimycotics (e.g., ketoconazole, 
itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole) and HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir). These 
medicinal products may increase apixaban exposure by 2-fold (see section 4.5) or greater in the 
presence of additional factors that increase apixaban exposure (e.g., severe renal impairment). 
Interaction with inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp 
The concomitant use of apixaban with strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, 
carbamazepine, phenobarbital or St. John’s Wort) may lead to a ~50% reduction in apixaban exposure. 
In a clinical study in atrial fibrillation patients, diminished efficacy and a higher risk of bleeding were 
observed with coadministration of apixaban with strong inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp compared 
with using apixaban alone. 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with strong inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp 
the following recommendations apply (see section 4.5): 
- 
- 
for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF and for the 
prevention of recurrent DVT and PE, apixaban should be used with caution; 
for the treatment of DVT and treatment of PE, apixaban should not be used since efficacy may 
be compromised. 
Laboratory parameters 
Clotting tests [e.g., prothrombin time (PT), INR, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)] are 
affected as expected by the mechanism of action of apixaban. Changes observed in these clotting tests 
at the expected therapeutic dose are small and subject to a high degree of variability (see section 5.1). 
Information about excipients 
Eliquis contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase 
deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
"sodium-free". 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp 
Coadministration of apixaban with ketoconazole (400 mg once a day), a strong inhibitor of both 
CYP3A4 and P-gp, led to a 2-fold increase in mean apixaban AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in mean 
apixaban Cmax. 
The use of apixaban is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with 
strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, such as azole-antimycotics (e.g., ketoconazole, 
itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole) and HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) (see 
section 4.4). 
Active substances which are not considered strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, (e.g., 
amiodarone, clarithromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, naproxen, quinidine, verapamil) are expected to 
increase apixaban plasma concentration to a lesser extent. No dose adjustment for apixaban is required 
when coadministered with agents that are not strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp. For 
example, diltiazem (360 mg once a day), considered a moderate CYP3A4 and a weak P-gp inhibitor, 
led to a 1.4-fold increase in mean apixaban AUC and a 1.3-fold increase in Cmax. Naproxen (500 mg, 
single dose) an inhibitor of P-gp but not an inhibitor of CYP3A4, led to a 1.5-fold and 1.6-fold 
increase in mean apixaban AUC and Cmax, respectively. Clarithromycin (500 mg, twice a day), an 
inhibitor of P-gp and a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, led to a 1.6-fold and 1.3-fold increase in mean 
apixaban AUC and Cmax respectively. 
Inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp 
Coadministration of apixaban with rifampicin, a strong inducer of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, led to an 
approximate 54% and 42% decrease in mean apixaban AUC and Cmax, respectively. The concomitant 
use of apixaban with other strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, 
phenobarbital or St. John’s Wort) may also lead to reduced apixaban plasma concentrations. No dose 
adjustment for apixaban is required during concomitant therapy with such medicinal products, 
however in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with strong inducers of both CYP3A4 
and P-gp apixaban should be used with caution for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in 
patients with NVAF and for the prevention of recurrent DVT and PE. Apixaban is not recommended 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for the treatment of DVT and PE in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with strong 
inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp since efficacy may be compromised (see section 4.4). 
Anticoagulants, platelet aggregation inhibitors, SSRIs/SNRIs and NSAIDs 
Due to an increased bleeding risk, concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants is 
contraindicated except under specific circumstances of switching anticoagulant therapy, when UFH is 
given at doses necessary to maintain an open central venous or arterial catheter or when UFH is given 
during catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (see section 4.3). 
After combined administration of enoxaparin (40 mg single dose) with apixaban (5 mg single dose), 
an additive effect on anti-Factor Xa activity was observed. 
Pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were not evident when apixaban was 
coadministered with ASA 325 mg once a day. 
Apixaban coadministered with clopidogrel (75 mg once a day) or with the combination of clopidogrel 
75 mg and ASA 162 mg once daily, or with prasugrel (60 mg followed by 10 mg once daily) in 
Phase I studies did not show a relevant increase in template bleeding time, or further inhibition of 
platelet aggregation, compared to administration of the antiplatelet agents without apixaban. Increases 
in clotting tests (PT, INR, and aPTT) were consistent with the effects of apixaban alone. 
Naproxen (500 mg), an inhibitor of P-gp, led to a 1.5-fold and 1.6-fold increase in mean apixaban 
AUC and Cmax, respectively. Corresponding increases in clotting tests were observed for apixaban. No 
changes were observed in the effect of naproxen on arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation and 
no clinically relevant prolongation of bleeding time was observed after concomitant administration of 
apixaban and naproxen. 
Despite these findings, there may be individuals with a more pronounced pharmacodynamic response 
when antiplatelet agents are coadministered with apixaban. Apixaban should be used with caution 
when coadministered with SSRIs/SNRIs, NSAIDs, ASA and/or P2Y12 inhibitors because these 
medicinal products typically increase the bleeding risk (see section 4.4). 
There is limited experience of co-administration with other platelet aggregation inhibitors (such as 
GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonists, dipyridamole, dextran or sulfinpyrazone) or thrombolytic agents. As 
such agents increase the bleeding risk, co-administration of these medicinal products with apixaban is 
not recommended (see section 4.4). 
Other concomitant therapies 
No clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when 
apixaban was coadministered with atenolol or famotidine. Coadministration of apixaban 10 mg with 
atenolol 100 mg did not have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of apixaban. 
Following administration of the two medicinal products together, mean apixaban AUC and Cmax were 
15% and 18% lower than when administered alone. The administration of apixaban 10 mg with 
famotidine 40 mg had no effect on apixaban AUC or Cmax. 
Effect of apixaban on other medicinal products 
In vitro apixaban studies showed no inhibitory effect on the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 (IC50 > 45 μM) and weak inhibitory effect on the activity 
of CYP2C19 (IC50 > 20 μM) at concentrations that are significantly greater than peak plasma 
concentrations observed in patients. Apixaban did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP3A4/5 at a 
concentration up to 20 μM. Therefore, apixaban is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of 
coadministered medicinal products that are metabolised by these enzymes. Apixaban is not a 
significant inhibitor of P-gp. 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In studies conducted in healthy subjects, as described below, apixaban did not meaningfully alter the 
pharmacokinetics of digoxin, naproxen, or atenolol. 
Digoxin 
Coadministration of apixaban (20 mg once a day) and digoxin (0.25 mg once a day), a P-gp substrate, 
did not affect digoxin AUC or Cmax. Therefore, apixaban does not inhibit P-gp mediated substrate 
transport. 
Naproxen 
Coadministration of single doses of apixaban (10 mg) and naproxen (500 mg), a commonly used 
NSAID, did not have any effect on the naproxen AUC or Cmax. 
Atenolol 
Coadministration of a single dose of apixaban (10 mg) and atenolol (100 mg), a common beta-blocker, 
did not alter the pharmacokinetics of atenolol. 
Activated charcoal 
Administration of activated charcoal reduces apixaban exposure (see section 4.9). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of apixaban in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct 
or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary 
measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of apixaban during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether apixaban or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available data in 
animals have shown excretion of apixaban in milk (see section 5.3). A risk to the suckling child cannot 
be excluded. 
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from 
apixaban therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of 
therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
Studies in animals dosed with apixaban have shown no effect on fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Eliquis has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety of apixaban has been investigated in 4 Phase III clinical studies including more than 
15,000 patients: more than 11,000 patients in NVAF studies and more than 4,000 patients in the VTE 
treatment (VTEt) studies, for an average total exposure of 1.7 years and 221 days respectively 
(see section 5.1). 
Common adverse reactions were haemorrhage, contusion, epistaxis, and haematoma (see Table 2 for 
adverse reaction profile and frequencies by indication). 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the NVAF studies, the overall incidence of adverse reactions related to bleeding with apixaban was 
24.3% in the apixaban vs warfarin study and 9.6% in the apixaban vs acetylsalicylic acid study. In the 
apixaban vs warfarin study the incidence of ISTH major gastrointestinal bleeds (including upper GI, 
lower GI, and rectal bleeding) with apixaban was 0.76%/year. The incidence of ISTH major 
intraocular bleeding with apixaban was 0.18%/year. 
In the VTEt studies, the overall incidence of adverse reactions related to bleeding with apixaban was 
15.6% in the apixaban vs enoxaparin/warfarin study and 13.3% in the apixaban vs placebo study 
(see section 5.1).

† The term “Brain haemorrhage” encompasses all intracranial or intraspinal haemorrhages (i.e., haemorrhagic stroke or 
putamen, cerebellar, intraventricular, or subdural haemorrhages). 
The use of apixaban may be associated with an increased risk of occult or overt bleeding from any 
tissue or organ, which may result in posthaemorrhagic anaemia. The signs, symptoms, and severity 
will vary according to the location and degree or extent of the bleeding (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Overdose of apixaban may result in a higher risk of bleeding. In the event of haemorrhagic 
complications, treatment must be discontinued and the source of bleeding investigated. The initiation 
of appropriate treatment, e.g., surgical haemostasis, the transfusion of fresh frozen plasma or the 
administration of a reversal agent for factor Xa inhibitors should be considered. 
In controlled clinical studies, orally-administered apixaban in healthy subjects at doses up to 50 mg 
daily for 3 to 7 days (25 mg twice daily (bid) for 7 days or 50 mg once daily (od) for 3 days) had no 
clinically relevant adverse reactions. 
In healthy subjects, administration of activated charcoal 2 and 6 hours after ingestion of a 20 mg dose 
of apixaban reduced mean apixaban AUC by 50% and 27%, respectively, and had no impact on Cmax. 
Mean half-life of apixaban decreased from 13.4 hours when apixaban was administered alone to 
5.3 hours and 4.9 hours, respectively, when activated charcoal was administered 2 and 6 hours after 
apixaban. Thus, administration of activated charcoal may be useful in the management of apixaban 
overdose or accidental ingestion. 
For situations when reversal of anticoagulation is needed due to life-threatening or uncontrolled 
bleeding, a reversal agent for factor Xa inhibitors is available (see section 4.4). Administration of 
prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) or recombinant factor VIIa may also be considered. 
Reversal of apixaban pharmacodynamic effects, as demonstrated by changes in the thrombin 
generation assay, was evident at the end of infusion and reached baseline values within 4 hours after 
the start of a 4-factor PCC 30 minute infusion in healthy subjects. However, there is no clinical 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
experience with the use of 4-factor PCC products to reverse bleeding in individuals who have received 
apixaban. Currently there is no experience with the use of recombinant factor VIIa in individuals 
receiving apixaban. Re-dosing of recombinant factor VIIa could be considered and titrated depending 
on improvement of bleeding. 
Depending on local availability, a consultation of a coagulation expert should be considered in case of 
major bleedings. 
Haemodialysis decreased apixaban AUC by 14% in subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), 
when a single dose of apixaban 5 mg was administered orally. Therefore, haemodialysis is unlikely to 
be an effective means of managing apixaban overdose.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, direct factor Xa inhibitors, ATC code: B01AF02 
Mechanism of action 
Apixaban is a potent, oral, reversible, direct and highly selective active site inhibitor of factor Xa. It 
does not require antithrombin III for antithrombotic activity. Apixaban inhibits free and clot-bound 
factor Xa, and prothrombinase activity. Apixaban has no direct effects on platelet aggregation, but 
indirectly inhibits platelet aggregation induced by thrombin. By inhibiting factor Xa, apixaban 
prevents thrombin generation and thrombus development. Preclinical studies of apixaban in animal 
models have demonstrated antithrombotic efficacy in the prevention of arterial and venous thrombosis 
at doses that preserved haemostasis. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
The pharmacodynamic effects of apixaban are reflective of the mechanism of action (FXa inhibition). 
As a result of FXa inhibition, apixaban prolongs clotting tests such as prothrombin time (PT), INR and 
activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Changes observed in these clotting tests at the expected 
therapeutic dose are small and subject to a high degree of variability. They are not recommended to 
assess the pharmacodynamic effects of apixaban. In the thrombin generation assay, apixaban reduced 
endogenous thrombin potential, a measure of thrombin generation in human plasma. 
Apixaban also demonstrates anti-Factor Xa activity as evident by reduction in Factor Xa enzyme 
activity in multiple commercial anti-Factor Xa kits, however results differ across kits. Data from 
clinical studies are only available for the Rotachrom® Heparin chromogenic assay. Anti-Factor Xa 
activity exhibits a close direct linear relationship with apixaban plasma concentration, reaching 
maximum values at the time of apixaban peak plasma concentrations. The relationship between 
apixaban plasma concentration and anti-Factor Xa activity is approximately linear over a wide dose 
range of apixaban. 
Table 3 below shows the predicted steady state exposure and anti-Factor Xa activity. In non-valvular 
atrial fibrillation patients taking apixaban for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism, the 
results demonstrate a less than 1.7-fold fluctuation in peak-to-trough levels. In patients taking 
apixaban for the treatment of DVT and PE or prevention of recurrent DVT and PE, the results 
demonstrate a less than 2.2-fold fluctuation in peak-to-trough levels.

Although treatment with apixaban does not require routine monitoring of exposure, a calibrated 
quantitative anti-Factor Xa assay may be useful in exceptional situations where knowledge of 
apixaban exposure may help to inform clinical decisions, e.g., overdose and emergency surgery. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) 
A total of 23,799 patients were randomised in the clinical program (ARISTOTLE: apixaban versus 
warfarin, AVERROES: apixaban versus ASA) including 11,927 randomised to apixaban. The program 
was designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of apixaban for the prevention of stroke and 
systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and one or more additional 
risk factors, such as: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) 
age ≥ 75 years 
hypertension 
diabetes mellitus 
symptomatic heart failure (NYHA Class ≥ II) 
ARISTOTLE study 
In the ARISTOTLE study a total of 18,201 patients were randomised to double-blind treatment with 
apixaban 5 mg twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily in selected patients [4.7%], see section 4.2) or 
warfarin (target INR range 2.0-3.0), patients were exposed to study active substance for a mean of 
20 months. The mean age was 69.1 years, the mean CHADS2 score was 2.1, 18.9% of patients had 
prior stroke or TIA. 
In the study, apixaban achieved statistically significant superiority in the primary endpoint of 
prevention of stroke (haemorrhagic or ischaemic) and systemic embolism (see Table 4) compared with 
warfarin.

For patients randomised to warfarin, the median percentage of time in therapeutic range (TTR) 
(INR 2-3) was 66%. 
Apixaban showed a reduction of stroke and systemic embolism compared to warfarin across the 
different levels of center TTR; within the highest quartile of TTR according to center, the hazard ratio 
for apixaban vs warfarin was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.38, 1.40). 
Key secondary endpoints of major bleeding and all cause death were tested in a pre-specified 
hierarchical testing strategy to control the overall type 1 error in the trial. Statistically significant 
superiority was also achieved in the key secondary endpoints of both major bleeding and all-cause 
death (see Table 5). With improving monitoring of INR the observed benefits of apixaban compared to 
warfarin regarding all cause death diminish.

The overall discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 1.8% for apixaban and 2.6% for warfarin 
in the ARISTOTLE study. 
The efficacy results for prespecified subgroups, including CHADS2 score, age, body weight, gender, 
status of renal function, prior stroke or TIA and diabetes were consistent with the primary efficacy 
results for the overall population studied in the trial. 
The incidence of ISTH major gastrointestinal bleeds (including upper GI, lower GI, and rectal

AVERROES study 
In the AVERROES study a total of 5,598 patients considered to be unsuitable for VKA by the 
investigators were randomised to treatment with apixaban 5 mg twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily in 
selected patients [6.4%], see section 4.2) or ASA. ASA was given at a once daily dose of 81 mg 
(64%), 162 (26.9%), 243 (2.1%), or 324 mg (6.6%) at the discretion of the investigator. Patients were 
exposed to study active substance for a mean of 14 months. The mean age was 69.9 years, the mean 
CHADS2 score was 2.0 and 13.6% of patients had prior stroke or TIA. 
Common reasons for unsuitability for VKA therapy in the AVERROES study included 
unable/unlikely to obtain INRs at requested intervals (42.6%), patient refused treatment with VKA 
(37.4%), CHADS2 score = 1 and physician did not recommend VKA (21.3%), patient could not be 
relied on to adhere to VKA medicinal product instruction (15.0%), and difficulty/expected difficulty in 
contacting patient in case of urgent dose change (11.7%). 
AVERROES was stopped early based on a recommendation by the independent Data Monitoring 
Committee due to clear evidence of reduction of stroke and systemic embolism with an acceptable 
safety profile. 
The overall discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 1.5% for apixaban and 1.3% for ASA in 
the AVERROES study. 
In the study, apixaban achieved statistically significant superiority in the primary endpoint of

† Clinically Relevant Non-Major 
NVAF patients with ACS and/or undergoing PCI 
AUGUSTUS, an open-label, randomised, controlled, 2 by 2 factorial design trial, enrolled 
4614 patients with NVAF who had ACS (43%) and/or underwent PCI (56%). All patients received 
background therapy with a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel: 90.3%) prescribed per local standard of care. 
Patients were randomised up to 14 days after the ACS and/or PCI to either apixaban 5 mg twice daily 
(2.5 mg twice daily if two or more of the dose-reduction criteria were met; 4.2% received lower dose) 
or VKA and to either ASA (81 mg once daily) or placebo. The mean age was 69.9 years, 94% of 
patients randomised had a CHA2DS2-VASc score > 2, and 47% had a HAS-BLED score > 3. For 
patients randomised to VKA, the proportion of time in therapeutic range (TTR) (INR 2-3) was 56%, 
with 32% of time below TTR and 12% above TTR. 
The primary objective of AUGUSTUS was to assess safety, with a primary endpoint of ISTH major or 
CRNM bleeding. In the apixaban versus VKA comparison, the primary safety endpoint of ISTH major 
or CRNM bleeding at month 6 occurred in 241 (10.5%), and 332 (14.7%) patients in the apixaban arm 
and in the VKA arm respectively (HR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.58, 0.82; 2-sided p < 0.0001 for non 
inferiority and p < 0.0001 for superiority). For VKA, additional analyses using subgroups by TTR 
showed that the highest rate of bleeding was associated with the lowest quartile of TTR. The rate of 
bleeding was similar between apixaban and the highest quartile of TTR. 
In the ASA versus placebo comparison, the primary safety endpoint of ISTH major or CRNM 
bleeding at month 6 occurred in 367 (16.1%), and 204 (9.0%) patients in the ASA arm and in the 
placebo arm respectively (HR = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.58, 2.23; two-sided p < 0.0001). 
Specifically, in apixaban-treated patients, major or CRNM bleeding occurred in 157 (13.7%), and 84 
(7.4%) patients in the ASA arm and in the placebo arm respectively. In VKA-treated patients, major or 
CRNM bleeding occurred in 208 (18.5%), and 122 (10.8%) patients in the ASA arm and in the 
placebo arm respectively. 
Other treatment effects were evaluated as a secondary objective of the study, with composite 
endpoints. 
In the apixaban versus VKA comparison, the composite endpoint of death or re-hospitalisation 
occurred in 541 (23.5%) and 632 (27.4%) patients in the apixaban and in the VKA arm, respectively. 
The composite endpoint of death or ischemic event (stroke, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis or 
urgent revascularisation) occurred in 170 (7.4%), and 182 (7.9%) patients in the apixaban and in the 
VKA arm, respectively. 
In the ASA versus placebo comparison, the composite endpoint of death or re-hospitalisation occurred 
in 604 (26.2%) and 569 (24.7%) patients in the ASA and in the placebo arm, respectively. The 
composite endpoint of death or ischemic event (stroke, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis or 
urgent revascularisation) occurred in 163 (7.1%), and 189 (8.2%) patients in the ASA and in the 
placebo arm, respectively. 
Patients undergoing cardioversion 
EMANATE, an open-label, multi-center study, enrolled 1500 patients who were either oral 
anticoagulant naïve or pre-treated less than 48 hours, and scheduled for cardioversion for NVAF. 
Patients were randomised 1:1 to apixaban or to heparin and/or VKA for the prevention of 
cardiovascular events. Electrical and/or pharmacologic cardioversion was conducted after at least 
5 doses of 5 mg twice daily apixaban (or 2.5 mg twice daily in selected patients (see section 4.2)) or at 
least 2 hours after a 10 mg loading dose (or a 5 mg loading dose in selected patients (see section 4.2)) 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
if earlier cardioversion was required. In the apixaban group, 342 patients received a loading dose 
(331 patients received the 10 mg dose and 11 patients received the 5 mg dose). 
There were no strokes (0%) in the apixaban group (n = 753) and 6 (0.80%) strokes in the heparin 
and/or VKA group (n = 747; RR 0.00, 95% CI 0.00, 0.64). All-cause death occurred in 2 patients 
(0.27%) in the apixaban group and 1 patient (0.13%) in the heparin and/or VKA group. No systemic 
embolism events were reported. 
Major bleeding and CRNM bleeding events occurred in 3 (0.41%) and 11 (1.50%) patients, 
respectively, in the apixaban group, compared to 6 (0.83%) and 13 (1.80%) patients in the heparin 
and/or VKA group. 
This exploratory study showed comparable efficacy and safety between apixaban and heparin and/or 
VKA treatment groups in the setting of cardioversion. 
Treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTEt) 
The clinical program (AMPLIFY: apixaban versus enoxaparin/warfarin, AMPLIFY-EXT: apixaban 
versus placebo) was designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of apixaban for the treatment of 
DVT and/or PE (AMPLIFY), and extended therapy for the prevention of recurrent DVT and/or PE 
following 6 to 12 months of anticoagulant treatment for DVT and/or PE (AMPLIFY-EXT). Both 
studies were randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, multinational trials in patients with 
symptomatic proximal DVT or symptomatic PE. All the key safety and efficacy endpoints were 
adjudicated by an independent blinded committee. 
AMPLIFY study 
In the AMPLIFY study a total of 5,395 patients were randomised to treatment with apixaban 10 mg 
twice daily orally for 7 days followed by apixaban 5 mg twice daily orally for 6 months, or enoxaparin 
1 mg/kg twice daily subcutaneously for at least 5 days (until INR≥ 2) and warfarin (target INR range 
2.0-3.0) orally for 6 months. 
The mean age was 56.9 years and 89.8% of randomised patients had unprovoked VTE events. 
For patients randomised to warfarin, the mean percentage of time in therapeutic range (INR 2.0-3.0) 
was 60.9. Apixaban showed a reduction in recurrent symptomatic VTE or VTE-related death across 
the different levels of center TTR; within the highest quartile of TTR according to center, the relative 
risk for apixaban vs enoxaparin/warfarin was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.39, 1.61). 
In the study, apixaban was shown to be non-inferior to enoxaparin/warfarin in the combined primary 
endpoint of adjudicated recurrent symptomatic VTE (nonfatal DVT or nonfatal PE) or VTE-related 
death (see Table 8).

Apixaban efficacy in initial treatment of VTE was consistent between patients who were treated for a 
PE [Relative Risk 0.9; 95% CI (0.5, 1.6)] or DVT [Relative Risk 0.8; 95% CI (0.5, 1.3)]. Efficacy across 
subgroups, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), renal function, extent of index PE, location 
of DVT thrombus, and prior parenteral heparin use was generally consistent. 
The primary safety endpoint was major bleeding. In the study, apixaban was statistically superior to 
enoxaparin/warfarin in the primary safety endpoint [Relative Risk 0.31, 95% confidence interval (0.17, 
0.55), P-value < 0.0001] (see Table 9).

The adjudicated major bleeding and CRNM bleeding at any anatomical site were generally lower in 
the apixaban group as compared to the enoxaparin/warfarin group. Adjudicated ISTH major 
gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in 6 (0.2%) apixaban-treated patients and 17 (0.6%) 
enoxaparin/warfarin-treated patients. 
AMPLIFY-EXT study 
In the AMPLIFY-EXT study a total of 2,482 patients were randomised to treatment with apixaban 
2.5 mg twice daily orally, apixaban 5 mg twice daily orally, or placebo for 12 months after completing 
6 to 12 months of initial anticoagulant treatment. Of these, 836 patients (33.7%) participated in the 
AMPLIFY study prior to enrollment in the AMPLIFY-EXT study. The mean age was 56.7 years and 
91.7% of randomised patients had unprovoked VTE events. 
In the study, both doses of apixaban were statistically superior to placebo in the primary endpoint of 
symptomatic, recurrent VTE (nonfatal DVT or nonfatal PE) or all-cause death (see Table 10).

† Individual subjects could experience more than one event and be represented in both classifications 
Apixaban efficacy for prevention of a recurrence of a VTE was maintained across subgroups, including 
age, gender, BMI, and renal function. 
The primary safety endpoint was major bleeding during the treatment period. In the study, the incidence 
in major bleeding for both apixaban doses was not statistically different from placebo. There was no 
statistically significant difference in the incidence of major + CRNM, minor, and all bleeding between 
the apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily and placebo treatment groups (see Table 11).

Prevention of VTE in paediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or lymphoblastic

In the PREVAPIX-ALL study, a total of 512 patients age ≥ 1 to < 18 with newly diagnosed ALL or 
LL, undergoing induction chemotherapy including asparaginase via an indwelling central venous 
access device, were randomised 1:1 to open-label thromboprophylaxis with apixaban or standard of 
care (with no systemic anticoagulation). Apixaban was administered according to a fixed-dose, body 
weight-tiered regimen designed to produce exposures comparable to those seen in adults who received 
2.5 mg twice daily (see Table 12). Apixaban was provided as a 2.5 mg tablet, 0.5 mg tablet, or 
0.4 mg/mL oral solution. The median duration of exposure in the apixaban arm was 25 days.

The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of adjudicated symptomatic and asymptomatic non-
fatal deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, and venous 
thromboembolism-related death. The incidence of the primary efficacy endpoint was 31 (12.1%) in the 
apixaban arm versus 45 (17.6%) in the standard of care arm. The relative risk reduction did not 
achieve significance. 
Safety endpoints were adjudicated according to ISTH criteria. The primary safety endpoint, major 
bleeding, occurred in 0.8% of patients in each treatment arm. CRNM bleeding occurred in 11 patients 
(4.3%) in the apixaban arm and 3 patients (1.2%) in the standard of care arm. The most common 
CRNM bleeding event contributing to the treatment difference was mild to moderate intensity 
epistaxis. Minor bleeding events occurred in 37 patients in the apixaban arm (14.5%) and 20 patients 
(7.8%) in the standard of care arm. 
Prevention of thromboembolism (TE) in paediatric patients with congenital or acquired heart disease 
SAXOPHONE was a randomised 2:1 open-label, multi-center comparative study of patients 28 days 
to < 18 years of age with congenital or acquired heart disease who require anticoagulation. Patients 
received either apixaban or standard of care thromboprophylaxis with a vitamin K antagonist or low 
molecular weight heparin. Apixaban was administered according to a fixed-dose, body weight-tiered 
regimen designed to produce exposures comparable to those seen in adults who received a dose of 
5 mg twice daily (see Table 13). Apixaban was provided as a 5 mg tablet, 0.5 mg tablet, or 0.4 mg/mL 
oral solution. The mean duration of exposure in the apixaban arm was 331 days.

The primary safety endpoint, a composite of adjudicated ISTH defined major and CRNM bleeding, 
occurred in 1 (0.8%) of 126 patients in the apixaban arm and 3 (4.8%) of 62 patients in the standard of 
care arm. The secondary safety endpoints of adjudicated major, CRNM, and all bleeding events were 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
similar in incidence across the two treatment arms. The secondary safety endpoint of drug 
discontinuation due to adverse event, intolerability, or bleeding was reported in 7 (5.6%) subjects in 
the apixaban arm and 1 (1.6%) subject in the standard of care arm. No patients in either treatment arm 
experienced a thromboembolic event. There were no deaths in either treatment arm. 
This study was prospectively designed for descriptive efficacy and safety because of the expected low 
incidence of TE and bleeding events in this population. Due to the observed low incidence of TE in 
this study a definitive risk benefit assessment could not be established. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies for the 
treatment of venous thromboembolism with Eliquis in one or more subsets of the paediatric population 
(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
The absolute bioavailability of apixaban is approximately 50% for doses up to 10 mg. Apixaban is 
rapidly absorbed with maximum concentrations (Cmax) appearing 3 to 4 hours after tablet intake. Intake 
with food does not affect apixaban AUC or Cmax at the 10 mg dose. Apixaban can be taken with or 
without food. 
Apixaban demonstrates linear pharmacokinetics with dose proportional increases in exposure for oral 
doses up to 10 mg. At doses ≥ 25 mg apixaban displays dissolution limited absorption with decreased 
bioavailability. Apixaban exposure parameters exhibit low to moderate variability reflected by a 
within-subject and inter-subject variability of ~20% CV and ~30% CV, respectively. 
Following oral administration of 10 mg of apixaban as 2 crushed 5 mg tablets suspended in 30 mL of 
water, exposure was comparable to exposure after oral administration of 2 whole 5 mg tablets. 
Following oral administration of 10 mg of apixaban as 2 crushed 5 mg tablets with 30 g of apple 
puree, the Cmax and AUC were 21% and 16% lower, respectively, when compared to administration of 
2 whole 5 mg tablets. The reduction in exposure is not considered clinically relevant. 
Following administration of a crushed 5 mg apixaban tablet suspended in 60 mL of G5W and 
delivered via a nasogastric tube, exposure was similar to exposure seen in other clinical studies 
involving healthy subjects receiving a single oral 5 mg apixaban tablet dose. 
Given the predictable, dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile of apixaban, the bioavailability 
results from the conducted studies are applicable to lower apixaban doses. 
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding in humans is approximately 87%. The volume of distribution (Vss) is 
approximately 21 litres. 
Biotransformation and elimination 
Apixaban has multiple routes of elimination. Of the administered apixaban dose in humans, 
approximately 25% was recovered as metabolites, with the majority recovered in faeces. Renal 
excretion of apixaban accounts for approximately 27% of total clearance. Additional contributions 
from biliary and direct intestinal excretion were observed in clinical and nonclinical studies, 
respectively. 
Apixaban has a total clearance of about 3.3 L/h and a half-life of approximately 12 hours. 
O-demethylation and hydroxylation at the 3-oxopiperidinyl moiety are the major sites of 
biotransformation. Apixaban is metabolised mainly via CYP3A4/5 with minor contributions from 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2J2. Unchanged apixaban is the major active substance-related 
component in human plasma with no active circulating metabolites present. Apixaban is a substrate of 
transport proteins, P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). 
Elderly 
Elderly patients (above 65 years) exhibited higher plasma concentrations than younger patients, with 
mean AUC values being approximately 32% higher and no difference in Cmax. 
Renal impairment 
There was no impact of impaired renal function on peak concentration of apixaban. There was an 
increase in apixaban exposure correlated to decrease in renal function, as assessed via measured 
creatinine clearance. In individuals with mild (creatinine clearance 51-80 mL/min), moderate 
(creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min) and severe (creatinine clearance 15-29 mL/min) renal 
impairment, apixaban plasma concentrations (AUC) were increased 16, 29, and 44% respectively, 
compared to individuals with normal creatinine clearance. Renal impairment had no evident effect on 
the relationship between apixaban plasma concentration and anti-Factor Xa activity. 
In subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the AUC of apixaban was increased by 36% when a 
single dose of apixaban 5 mg was administered immediately after haemodialysis, compared to that 
seen in subjects with normal renal function. Haemodialysis, started two hours after administration of a 
single dose of apixaban 5 mg, decreased apixaban AUC by 14% in these ESRD subjects, 
corresponding to an apixaban dialysis clearance of 18 mL/min. Therefore, haemodialysis is unlikely to 
be an effective means of managing apixaban overdose. 
Hepatic impairment 
In a study comparing 8 subjects with mild hepatic impairment, Child-Pugh A score 5 (n = 6) and 
score 6 (n = 2), and 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, Child-Pugh B score 7 (n = 6) and 
score 8 (n = 2), to 16 healthy control subjects, the single-dose pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of apixaban 5 mg were not altered in subjects with hepatic impairment. Changes in 
anti-Factor Xa activity and INR were comparable between subjects with mild to moderate hepatic 
impairment and healthy subjects. 
Gender 
Exposure to apixaban was approximately 18% higher in females than in males. 
Ethnic origin and race 
The results across phase I studies showed no discernible difference in apixaban pharmacokinetics 
between White/Caucasian, Asian and Black/African American subjects. Findings from a population 
pharmacokinetic analysis in patients who received apixaban were generally consistent with the phase I 
results. 
Body weight 
Compared to apixaban exposure in subjects with body weight of 65 to 85 kg, body weight > 120 kg 
was associated with approximately 30% lower exposure and body weight < 50 kg was associated with 
approximately 30% higher exposure. 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship 
The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship between apixaban plasma concentration 
and several PD endpoints (anti-Factor Xa activity, INR, PT, aPTT) has been evaluated after 
administration of a wide range of doses (0.5 – 50 mg). The relationship between apixaban plasma 
53 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
concentration and anti-Factor Xa activity was best described by a linear model. The PK/PD 
relationship observed in patients was consistent with that established in healthy subjects. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Preclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, fertility and embryo-foetal 
development and juvenile toxicity. 
The major observed effects in the repeated dose toxicity studies were those related to the 
pharmacodynamic action of apixaban on blood coagulation parameters. In the toxicity studies little to 
no increase of bleeding tendency was found. However, since this may be due to a lower sensitivity of 
the non-clinical species compared to humans, this result should be interpreted with caution when 
extrapolating to humans. 
In rat milk, a high milk to maternal plasma ratio (Cmax about 8, AUC about 30) was found, possibly 
due to active transport into the milk.

Eliquis (apixaban) 
Patient Alert Card 
Carry this card with you at all times 
Show this card to your pharmacist, dentist and any other healthcare professionals that treat you. 
I am under anticoagulation treatment with Eliquis (apixaban) to prevent blood clots 
Please complete this section or ask your doctor to do it 
Name: 
Birth Date: 
Indication: 
Dose:      mg twice daily 
Doctor's Name: 
Doctor's telephone: 
Information for patients 
 
Take Eliquis regularly as instructed. If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember and 
continue to follow your dosing schedule. 
Do not stop taking Eliquis without talking to your doctor, as you are at risk of suffering from a 
stroke or other complications. 
Eliquis helps to thin your blood. However, this may increase your risk of bleeding. 
Signs and symptoms of bleeding include bruising or bleeding under the skin, tar-coloured 
stools, blood in urine, nose-bleed, dizziness, tiredness, paleness or weakness, sudden severe 
headache, coughing up blood or vomiting blood. 
If the bleeding does not stop on its own, seek medical attention immediately. 
If you need surgery or any invasive procedure, inform your doctor that you are taking Eliquis. 
{MMM YYYY} 
Information for healthcare professionals 
 
 
Eliquis (apixaban) is an oral anticoagulant acting by direct selective inhibition of factor Xa. 
Eliquis may increase the risk of bleeding. In case of major bleeding events, it should be stopped 
immediately. 
Treatment with Eliquis does not require routine monitoring of exposure. A calibrated 
quantitative anti-Factor Xa assay may be useful in exceptional situations, e.g., overdose and 
emergency surgery (prothrombin time (PT), international normalised ratio (INR) and activated 
partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) clotting tests are not recommended) – see SmPC. 
An agent to reverse the anti-factor Xa activity of apixaban is available.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Eliquis is and what it is used for 
Eliquis contains the active substance apixaban and belongs to a group of medicines called 
anticoagulants. This medicine helps to prevent blood clots from forming by blocking Factor Xa, which 
is an important component of blood clotting. 
Eliquis is used in adults: 
- 
to prevent blood clots (deep vein thrombosis [DVT]) from forming after hip or knee 
replacement operations. After an operation to the hip or knee you may be at a higher risk of 
developing blood clots in your leg veins. This can cause the legs to swell, with or without pain. 
If a blood clot travels from your leg to your lungs, it can block blood flow causing 
breathlessness, with or without chest pain. This condition (pulmonary embolism) can be 
life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. 
- 
- 
to prevent a blood clot from forming in the heart in patients with an irregular heart beat (atrial 
fibrillation) and at least one additional risk factor. Blood clots may break off and travel to the 
brain and lead to a stroke or to other organs and prevent normal blood flow to that organ (also 
known as a systemic embolism). A stroke can be life-threatening and requires immediate 
medical attention. 
to treat blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis) and in the blood vessels of 
your lungs (pulmonary embolism), and to prevent blood clots from re-occurring in the blood 
vessels of your legs and/or lungs. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Eliquis 
Do not take Eliquis if: 
- 
you are allergic to apixaban or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6); 
you are bleeding excessively; 
you have a disease in an organ of the body that increases the risk of serious bleeding (such as 
an active or a recent ulcer of your stomach or bowel, recent bleeding in your brain); 
- 
- 
71 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
you have a liver disease which leads to increased risk of bleeding (hepatic coagulopathy); 
you are taking medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g., warfarin, rivaroxaban, dabigatran or 
heparin), except when changing anticoagulant treatment, while having a venous or arterial line 
and you get heparin through this line to keep it open, or if a tube is inserted into your blood 
vessel (catheter ablation) to treat an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you take this medicine if you have any of the 
following: 
- 
bleeding disorders, including conditions resulting in reduced platelet activity; 
very high blood pressure, not controlled by medical treatment; 
you are older than 75 years; 
you weigh 60 kg or less; 
an increased risk of bleeding, such as: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
a severe kidney disease or if you are on dialysis; 
a liver problem or a history of liver problems; 
- 
had a tube (catheter) or an injection into your spinal column (for anaesthesia or pain 
reduction), your doctor will tell you to take this medicine 5 hours or more after catheter 
removal; 
if you have a prosthetic heart valve; 
if your doctor determines that your blood pressure is unstable or another treatment or surgical 
procedure to remove the blood clot from your lungs is planned. 
This medicine will be used with caution in patients with signs of altered liver function. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Take special care with Eliquis 
- 
if you know that you have a disease called antiphospholipid syndrome (a disorder of the 
immune system that causes an increased risk of blood clots), tell your doctor who will decide if 
the treatment may need to be changed. 
If you need to have surgery or a procedure which may cause bleeding, your doctor might ask you to 
temporarily stop taking this medicine for a short while. If you are not sure whether a procedure may 
cause bleeding ask your doctor. 
Children and adolescents 
This medicine is not recommended in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. 
Other medicines and Eliquis 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Some medicines may increase the effects of Eliquis and some may decrease its effects. Your doctor 
will decide, if you should be treated with Eliquis when taking these medicines and how closely you 
should be monitored. 
The following medicines may increase the effects of Eliquis and increase the chance for unwanted 
bleeding: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
some medicines for fungal infections (e.g., ketoconazole, etc.); 
some antiviral medicines for HIV/AIDS (e.g., ritonavir); 
other medicines that are used to reduce blood clotting (e.g., enoxaparin, etc.); 
anti-inflammatory or pain medicines (e.g., acetylsalicylic acid or naproxen). Especially, if 
you are older than 75 years and are taking acetylsalicylic acid, you may have an increased 
chance of bleeding; 
medicines for high blood pressure or heart problems (e.g., diltiazem); 
antidepressant medicines called selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors or serotonin 
norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors. 
- 
- 
72 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The following medicines may reduce the ability of Eliquis to help prevent blood clots from forming: 
- 
- 
- 
medicines to prevent epilepsy or seizures (e.g., phenytoin, etc.); 
St John’s Wort (a herbal supplement used for depression); 
medicines to treat tuberculosis or other infections (e.g., rifampicin). 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking this medicine. 
The effects of Eliquis on pregnancy and the unborn child are not known. You should not take this 
medicine if you are pregnant. Contact your doctor immediately if you become pregnant while taking 
this medicine. 
It is not known if Eliquis passes into human breast milk. Ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for 
advice before taking this medicine while breast-feeding. They will advise you whether to stop 
breast-feeding or to stop/not start taking this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Eliquis has not been shown to impair your ability to drive or use machines. 
Eliquis contains lactose (a type of sugar) and sodium 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
"sodium-free". 
3. 
How to take Eliquis 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. 
Dose 
Swallow the tablet with a drink of water. Eliquis can be taken with or without food. 
Try to take the tablets at the same times every day to have the best treatment effect. 
If you have difficulty swallowing the tablet whole, talk to your doctor about other ways to take 
Eliquis. The tablet may be crushed and mixed with water, or 5% glucose in water, or apple juice or 
apple puree, immediately before you take it. 
Instructions for crushing: 
• 
• 
Crush the tablets with a pestle and mortar. 
Transfer all the powder carefully into a suitable container then mix the powder with a little e.g., 
30 mL (2 tablespoons), water or one of the other liquids mentioned above to make a mixture. 
Swallow the mixture. 
Rinse the pestle and mortar you used for crushing the tablet and the container, with a little water 
or one of the other liquids (e.g., 30 mL), and swallow the rinse. 
• 
• 
If necessary, your doctor may also give you the crushed Eliquis tablet mixed in 60 mL of water or 
5% glucose in water, through a nasogastric tube. 
Take Eliquis as recommended for the following: 
To prevent blood clots from forming after hip or knee replacement operations. 
The recommended dose is one tablet of Eliquis 2.5 mg twice a day. For example, one in the morning

Your doctor might change your anticoagulant treatment as follows: 
Changing from Eliquis to anticoagulant medicines 
- 
Stop taking Eliquis. Start treatment with the anticoagulant medicines (for example heparin) at the time 
you would have taken the next tablet. 
Changing from anticoagulant medicines to Eliquis 
- 
Stop taking the anticoagulant medicines. Start treatment with Eliquis at the time you would have had 
the next dose of anticoagulant medicine, then continue as normal. 
- 
Changing from treatment with anticoagulant containing vitamin K antagonist (e.g., warfarin) to 
Eliquis 
Stop taking the medicine containing a vitamin K antagonist. Your doctor needs to do 
blood-measurements and instruct you when to start taking Eliquis. 
- 
Changing from Eliquis to anticoagulant treatment containing vitamin K antagonist (e.g., 
warfarin). 
If your doctor tells you that you have to start taking the medicine containing a vitamin K antagonist, 
continue to take Eliquis for at least 2 days after your first dose of the medicine containing a vitamin K 
antagonist. Your doctor needs to do blood-measurements and instruct you when to stop taking Eliquis. 
Patients undergoing cardioversion 
If your abnormal heartbeat needs to be restored to normal by a procedure called cardioversion, take 
this medicine at the times your doctor tells you, to prevent blood clots in blood vessels in your brain 
and other blood vessels in your body.

If you take more Eliquis than you should 
Tell your doctor immediately if you have taken more than the prescribed dose of this medicine. Take 
the medicine pack with you, even if there are no tablets left. 
If you take more Eliquis than recommended, you may have an increased risk of bleeding. If bleeding 
occurs, surgery, blood transfusions, or other treatments that may reverse anti-factor Xa activity may be 
required. 
If you forget to take Eliquis 
- 
Take the dose as soon as you remember and: 
- 
- 
take the next dose of Eliquis at the usual time 
then continue as normal. 
If you are not sure what to do or have missed more than one dose, ask your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse. 
If you stop taking Eliquis 
Do not stop taking this medicine without talking to your doctor first, because the risk of developing a 
blood clot could be higher if you stop treatment too early. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

How to store Eliquis 
Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Eliquis is and what it is used for 
Eliquis contains the active substance apixaban and belongs to a group of medicines called 
anticoagulants. This medicine helps to prevent blood clots from forming by blocking Factor Xa, which 
is an important component of blood clotting. 
Eliquis is used in adults: 
- 
to prevent a blood clot from forming in the heart in patients with an irregular heart beat (atrial 
fibrillation) and at least one additional risk factor. Blood clots may break off and travel to the 
brain and lead to a stroke or to other organs and prevent normal blood flow to that organ (also 
known as a systemic embolism). A stroke can be life-threatening and requires immediate 
medical attention. 
to treat blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis) and in the blood vessels of 
your lungs (pulmonary embolism), and to prevent blood clots from re-occurring in the blood 
vessels of your legs and/or lungs. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Eliquis 
Do not take Eliquis if: 
- 
you are allergic to apixaban or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6); 
you are bleeding excessively; 
you have a disease in an organ of the body that increases the risk of serious bleeding (such as 
an active or a recent ulcer of your stomach or bowel, recent bleeding in your brain); 
you have a liver disease which leads to increased risk of bleeding (hepatic coagulopathy); 
you are taking medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g., warfarin, rivaroxaban, dabigatran or 
heparin), except when changing anticoagulant treatment, while having a venous or arterial line 
and you get heparin through this line to keep it open, or if a tube is inserted into your blood 
vessel (catheter ablation) to treat an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia).

Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you take this medicine if you have any of the 
following: 
- 
bleeding disorders, including conditions resulting in reduced platelet activity; 
very high blood pressure, not controlled by medical treatment; 
you are older than 75 years; 
you weigh 60 kg or less; 
an increased risk of bleeding, such as: 
-

- 
- 
a severe kidney disease or if you are on dialysis; 
a liver problem or a history of liver problems; 
- 
if you have a prosthetic heart valve; 
if your doctor determines that your blood pressure is unstable or another treatment or surgical 
procedure to remove the blood clot from your lungs is planned. 
This medicine will be used with caution in patients with signs of altered liver function. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Take special care with Eliquis 
- 
if you know that you have a disease called antiphospholipid syndrome (a disorder of the 
immune system that causes an increased risk of blood clots), tell your doctor who will decide if 
the treatment may need to be changed. 
If you need to have surgery or a procedure which may cause bleeding, your doctor might ask you to 
temporarily stop taking this medicine for a short while. If you are not sure whether a procedure may 
cause bleeding ask your doctor.

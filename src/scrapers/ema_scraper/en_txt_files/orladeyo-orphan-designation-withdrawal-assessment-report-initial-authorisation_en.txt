2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
Orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2018 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
The sponsor BioCryst UK Ltd submitted on 18 January 2018 an application for designation as an 
orphan medicinal product to the European Medicines Agency for a medicinal product containing  
(R)-1-(3-(aminomethyl) phenyl)-N-(5-((3-cyanophenyl)(cyclopropylmethylamino)methyl)-2-
fluorophenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxamide dihydrochloride for treatment of 
hereditary angioedema (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”). The application was submitted on 
the basis of Article 3(1)(a) first paragraph of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products. 
Having examined the application, the COMP considered that the sponsor has established the following: 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing (R)-1-(3-(aminomethyl) 
phenyl)-N-(5-((3-cyanophenyl)(cyclopropylmethylamino)methyl)-2-fluorophenyl)-3-
(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxamide dihydrochloride was considered justified based on 
preliminary clinical data showing a significant reduction in attacks in patients with the condition; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to recurrent attacks of oedema in 
various parts of the body that may cause airway obstruction leading to asphyxia; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 0.5 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made.  
Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products are fulfilled. 
In addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition exist in the European Union, 
the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal product 
containing (R)-1-(3-(aminomethyl) phenyl)-N-(5-((3-cyanophenyl)(cyclopropylmethylamino)methyl)-
2-fluorophenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxamide dihydrochloride will be of significant 
benefit to those affected by the condition. The sponsor has provided clinical data that demonstrate a 
significant reduction in the number of attacks, the use of intravenous C1 inhibitor replacement therapy 
and an alternative to using an oral formulation where currently none exists. The Committee considered 
that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage and major contribution to patient care. 
Thus, the requirement under Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products is fulfilled. 
The COMP concludes that the requirements laid down in Article (3)(1) (a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) 
No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products are fulfilled. The COMP therefore recommends the 
designation of this medicinal product, containing (R)-1-(3-(aminomethyl) phenyl)-N-(5-((3-
cyanophenyl)(cyclopropylmethylamino)methyl)-2-fluorophenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazole-5-

carboxamide dihydrochloride as an orphan medicinal product for the orphan indication: treatment of 
hereditary angioedema. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Hereditary angioedema is a rare, potentially life-threatening disorder characterized by attacks of 
cutaneous and submucosal swelling. The fundamental defect of hereditary angioedema is a deficiency 
of functional C1 inhibitor protein, a protease inhibitor in the serpin superfamily, that is linked to 
bradykinin the biologic mediator of swelling. 
Angioedema is the physical manifestation of transient increases in vascular permeability. Bradykinin, 
generated by activation of the plasma contact system, has been conclusively identified as the mediator 
of swelling in hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency. The plasma contact system 
comprises coagulation factor XII, plasma prekallikrein, and high-molecular-weight kininogen; plasma 
prekallikrein and high-molecular-weight kininogen circulate as a 1:1 bimolecular complex. Despite the 
interactions between the activated plasma contact and fibrinolytic systems, patients with hereditary 
angioedema do not appear to be at an increased risk for bleeding or thrombosis. 
The fundamental abnormality in hereditary angioedema types I and II is a deficiency of functional C1 
inhibitor (due to a mutation in SERPING1), which regulates multiple proteases involved in the 
complement, contact-system, coagulation, and fibrinolytic pathways. Within the contact cascade, C1 
inhibitor inactivates plasma kallikrein, factor XIIa, and factor XIIf, operating as a “molecular 
mousetrap.” When the Arg444–Thr445 bond in the reactive loop of the molecule is cleaved, a 
conformational rearrangement is triggered — called suicide inactivation — that irreversibly buries the 
protease in the C1 inhibitor molecule. Suicide inactivation results in a thermodynamically stable C1 
inhibitor–protease complex. 
The mutations that lead to hereditary angioedema type I are diverse, with missense, nonsense, 
frameshift deletion or insertion, or splicing defects scattered throughout the gene, resulting in 
truncated or misfolded C1 inhibitor that is not efficiently secreted. In hereditary angioedema type II, 
the defect is typically a missense mutation in exon 8, affecting the mobile loop and interfering with the 
ability to inhibit target proteases, with rare exceptions. The critical functional threshold for C1 inhibitor 
control of the plasma contact system is approximately 40%. Functional C1 inhibitor levels in hereditary 
angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency are generally 5 to 30% of the normal level, despite the 
presence of one normal gene. The cause of this discrepancy has been proposed to involve enhanced 
clearance of C1 inhibitor–protease complexes, cleavage of C1 inhibitor into an inactive, 94-kD form, 
and inhibition of the normal gene product by the abnormal one, designated as “transinhibition.” A 
dominant negative effect on C1 inhibitor protein secretion has also been reported. 
Hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency is an autosomal dominant disorder. Type I 
hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency accounts for 85% of cases, and type II accounts for 
Orphan designation withdrawal assessment report  
EMA/OD/0000045564 
Page 5/13 
 
 
 
 
 
15%. A third group of patients with hereditary angioedema, those with normal levels of C1 inhibitor, 
was first reported in 2000. Hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor levels has an autosomal 
dominant inheritance pattern with incomplete penetrance. 
For the diagnosis of the condition two types of C1 inhibitor functional analyses are available. The 
chromogenic assay (recommended when available) is more sensitive than the enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay. For children, measurement of the C4 level and the C1 inhibitor level appears to 
be accurate during the first year of life but should be repeated for verification. Genetic sequencing (if 
the mutation is known) can be used to establish an early diagnosis.  
Figure 1.   
The COMP continues to designate this condition. 
The approved therapeutic indication “ORLADEYO is indicated for routine prevention of recurrent attacks 
of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in adult and adolescent patients aged 12 years and older” falls within 
the scope of the designated orphan condition “treatment of hereditary angioedema”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has not yet been confirmed by a final positive benefit/risk assessment of the 
CHMP. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
The condition continues to be chronically debilitating and life-threatening. Recurrent attacks of 
cutaneous angioedema (asymmetric, nonpruritic, disfiguring, and nonpitting) without urticaria or 
spontaneously remitting, severe abdominal symptoms (pain and swelling) or both should alert the 
clinician to consider hereditary angioedema.  
Orphan designation withdrawal assessment report  
EMA/OD/0000045564 
Page 6/13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Although cutaneous and abdominal attacks are the most common feature, patients infrequently have 
genital swelling and, in rare cases, bladder, muscle, or joint swelling. Laryngeal episodes account for 
approximately 0.9% of all attacks; however, all patients are at risk for a laryngeal attack, and more 
than 50% have a laryngeal attack during their lifetime. A lethal laryngeal attack can be the initial 
presentation.  
In summary, attacks of the upper airways can result in asphyxiation. Abdominal attacks are painful 
and debilitating. Peripheral attacks such as those of hands or feet result in impaired function (Maurer 
et al 2017). 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor refers to the prevalence estimate provided in 2018 at the time of their initial orphan 
designation as sufficient and unchanged. The sponsor indicates that only one new publication has 
appeared since and cites an epidemiology study in Austria. They have identified a prevalence in 
Austrian patients with HAE with C1-inhibitor deficiency (HAE Type 1) or dysfunction (HAE Type 2) of 
1:64,396, or 0.16 in 10,000, which is consistent with previously reported prevalence estimates 
(Schoffl, Wiednig et al. 2019). 
Based on the above assumptions it is concluded that the prevalence has not changed at 0.5 in 10,000 
in the European Union. The COMP noted that at the time of a review for the Maintenance of the Orphan 
Designation it requests a more thorough prevalence estimate than the one provided at an initial 
orphan designation so it was considered necessary to raise a request for a revised more thorough 
prevalence estimate. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
Authorized products in the EU for the treatment of acute attacks include intravenous (IV) human 
plasma-derived C1-INH (pdC1-INH) replacement products (Cinryze, Berinert), IV recombinant human 
C1-INH (Ruconest) and subcutaneous (SC) icatibant (Firazyr) a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist. 
Authorized products for the prevention of recurrent attacks, include two formulations of plasma-
derived C1-INH (IV Cinryze and SC Berinert 2000/3000), and SC lanadelumab (Takhzyro) a 
recombinant monoclonal antibody inhibitor of plasma kallikrein. 
The current European Guidelines are part of “The international WAO/EAACI guideline for the 
management of hereditary angioedema – the 2017 revision and update, Maurer et al. World Allergy 
Organization Journal (2018) 11:5” and states for  
On-demand treatment: 
•  Early treatment with C1-INH concentrate, ecallantide (US only), or icatibant provides a better 
treatment response than late treatment. Early treatment is associated with a shorter time to 
resolution of symptoms and shorter total attack duration regardless of attack severity. As early 
treatment is facilitated by self-administration, all patients with HAE-1/2 should be considered for 
Orphan designation withdrawal assessment report  
EMA/OD/0000045564 
Page 7/13 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
home therapy and self-administration training. All C1-INH concentrates and icatibant are licensed 
for self-administration, although approved product indications vary around the world. 
Preprocedural prophylaxis with C1-INH concentrate is therefore recommended for all medical, 
surgical and dental procedures associated with any mechanical impact to the upper aerodigestive 
tract. 
Long-term prophylaxis of HAE refers to the use of regular medication to reduce the burden of the 
disease by preventing/attenuating attacks in patients with confirmed HAE-1/2. Long-term 
prophylaxis should be individualized and considered in all severely symptomatic HAE-1/2 patients 
taking into consideration the activity of the disease, frequency of attacks, patient’s quality of life, 
availability of health-care resources, and failure to achieve adequate control by appropriate on 
demand therapy. As all of these factors can vary over time, all patients should be evaluated for 
long-term prophylaxis at every visit, at least once a year. Successful long-term prophylaxis 
requires a high degree of compliance; therefore, the patient’s preferences should be taken into 
consideration. Patients with ongoing long-term prophylaxis should be assessed regularly for 
efficacy and safety of the therapy, and dosage and/or treatment interval should be adapted 
according to the clinical response. Upper airway edema and other attacks may occur despite the 
use of long-term prophylaxis. Therefore, all patients using long-term prophylaxis should also have 
on-demand medication (C1-INH concentrate, ecallantide, or icatibant). 
Significant benefit 
The sponsor believes that their product, berotralstat, offers significant benefit based on a major 
contribution to patient care. Berotralstat is the first oral formulation for the treatment of this condition 
to be authorised. All currently authorised products for the treatment are either subcutaneous injection 
or IV formulations. No claim regarding a clinically relevant advantage is made. To be regarded as 
making a major contribution to patient care, the product should at least be equivalent in terms of 
efficacy, safety and benefit/risk balance as compared with authorised medicinal products in the 
condition. 
Berostralstat is a kallikrein inhibitor which binds to plasma kallikrein and inhibits its proteolytic activity. 
Plasma kallikrein is a protease that cleaves high-molecular-weight-kininogen (HMWK) to generate 
cleaved HMWK and bradykinin, a potent vasodilator that increases vascular permeability resulting in 
swelling and pain associated with HAE. In patients with HAE caused by C1-inhibitor deficiency or 
dysfunction, normal regulation of plasma kallikrein activity is not present, which leads to uncontrolled 
increases in plasma kallikrein activity resulting in angioedema attacks. Berotralstat was authorised by 
the FDA in December 2020. 
Currently the only kallikrein inhibitor authorised in Europe is lanadelumab (Takhzyro) a recombinant 
monoclonal antibody inhibitor of plasma kallikrein which is delivered twice a month as a subcutaneous 
injection. The kallikrein inhibitor ecallantide (Kalbitor; Shire) is licensed only in the US.  
The sponsor received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on October 12, 2017 on the Phase 3 program to 
support registration. Protocol assistance for the justification of significant benefit was not sought by the 
sponsor as part of this procedure, as the sponsor obtained Orphan Designation only in 2018. 
To support their claim for major contribution to patient care the sponsor has provided a comparative 
table highlighting the differences between the drug administration approaches for Orladeyo, Cinryze, 
Bernisert and Takhzyro. No clinical data generated by the sponsor in the treatment of these patients 
has been submitted to support significant benefit for either efficacy equivalence nor major contribution 
Orphan designation withdrawal assessment report  
EMA/OD/0000045564 
Page 8/13 
 
 
 
 
 
to patient care. The sponsor only highlights difficulties in preparation of the different formulations 
before administration and reported adverse events.  
The COMP noted that Takhzyro, the only product with the same mode of action, also claimed a major 
contribution to patient care at the time of review for the maintenance of the orphan designation (OMAR 
Takhzyro 2017). It is a twice a month subcutaneous injection and was shown to have a major 
contribution to patient care to the IV formulations currently authorised at that time. No direct or 
indirect comparisons with Takhzyro have been made regarding similar efficacy or safety. During the 
plenary it was noted that Orladeyo may actually be less efficacious than Takhzyro.  
The COMP noted that 5 clinical efficacy trials where submitted to the CHMP and are summarised below. 
In the orphan maintenance submission the sponsor only discusses the pivotal Phase III trial BCX7353 
302. The main study is BCX7353 302 was conducted in a North American and European population. 
BCX 7353 301 was a smaller study with the same design as 302 conducted in Japan.

Summary of key points of BCX7 353-302 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to determine the efficacy of prophylactic BCX7353 110 mg and 
150 mg administered QD for 24 weeks compared to placebo in subjects with HAE. Secondary 
objectives relevant to efficacy included: to assess the effects of berotralstat on HAE disease activity 
and HAE attack characteristics; to evaluate the effects of berotralstat on QoL; to characterize the PD 
effects of berotralstat. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was: the rate of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during 
dosing in the entire 24-week treatment period (Day 1 to time of the first dose of study drug in Part 2). 
Secondary endpoints included the following: change from baseline in Angioedema Quality of Life 
questionnaire (AE-QoL) at Week 24 (total score); number and proportion of days with angioedema 
symptoms through 24 weeks; rate of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during dosing in the effective 
treatment period (beginning on Day 8 through to the first dose of study drug in Part 2. 
The COMP noted that in this trial only two parameters appear to be of interest namely the use of 
concomitant medicines (as an indirect measure of the use of healthcare resources) and the QoL 
measures for the purpose of the establishing the major contribution to patient care. These outcomes 
are presented below.

a)  a Medications were as recorded in the e-diary for each attack. The percentages provided were based on the 
number 
b)  of investigator-confirmed attacks. 
c)  b Medications displayed were those HAE medications recorded on the e-diary that were taken concomitantly with 
d)  study drug for an investigator-confirmed attack in Part 1. If a medication was used more than once for a given 
investigator-confirmed attack, a single occurrence was summarized. 
The summary of any C1-INH includes plasma-derived C1-INH replacement (brand names = Cinryze, Berinert, 
Haegarda), recombinant C1-INH replacement (brand name = Ruconest), and fresh frozen plasma. Subjects may 
have more than 1 medication that they use for HAE. 
Change from Baseline in Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire Total Score at Week 24 
The AE-QoL scores range from 0 to 100, and a decrease (change with a negative value) in AE-QoL 
questionnaire scores indicates an improvement in the subject’s QoL. The MCID for the AE-QoL 
questionnaire is -6 (total score). All treatment groups had an average QoL improvement that exceed 
the MCID. The LSM differences from placebo in AE-QoL total scores were -2.8 (95% CI: -10.1, 4.5; p = 
0.453) and -4.9 (95% CI: -12.2, 2.4; p = 0.188) for the berotralstat 110 and 150 mg treatment 
groups, respectively. The differences from placebo were not statistically significant. A hierarchical 
approach was used for statistical testing. As the secondary endpoint for change from baseline in 
Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire Total Score at week 24 was not met p values for the 
remaining secondary endpoints are nominal and no inference can be drawn.

The sponsor has not elaborated on how this data could show a significant benefit over Takhzyro let 
alone the other products currently authorised for use.  
Claims of better safety as a basis for major contribution to patient care was for example highlighted by 
the sponsor as reportedin the literature that Takhzyro causes important patient discomfort. Takhzyro is 
associated with a high incidence of injection site reaction (>50% of patients) including injection site 
pain, erythema, bruising, discomfort, haematoma, haemorrhage, pruritus, swelling, induration, 
paraesthesia, reaction, warmth, oedema and rash. Injection site reactions were associated with pain in 
43% of subjects (Banerji, Riedl et al. 2018). 
The claim for better safety was not supported by data generated by the sponsor in their clinical trials 
programme.   
For the COMP to establish significant benefit based on major contribution to patient care the sponsor 
should further elaborate on the comparison to Takhzyro which has the same mode of action as 
Orladeyo. Unless a comparative efficacy of both products can be shown the benefit of the oral 
formulation supporting a major contribution to patient care cannot be assessed. The claim that a once 
a day oral formulation offers a major contribution to patient care in comparison to Takhzyro which is a 
twice a month subcutaneous injection is not self-evident and further justification will be required. 
Further elaboration on parameters such as Quality of Life data as well as any other clinical or 
healthcare use data could help the COMP establish if the basis for significant benefit is met.  
4.  COMP list of issues 
Prevalence: 
The sponsor should provide a more thorough prevalence estimate. The assumptions made at the time 
of review for the Maintenance of the Orphan Designation appear to be limited.  
Significant benefit:  
The sponsor is proposing that their product offers a major contribution to patient care. To be regarded 
as making a major contribution to patient care, the product should at least be equivalent in terms of 
efficacy, safety and benefit/risk balance as compared with the authorised medicinal products. The 
sponsor should provide a comparative analysis to Takhzyro which also inhibits kallikrein and discuss 
the major contribution to patient care as it is delivered as a twice monthly sub cutaneous injection. 
Further elaboration on parameters such as Quality of Life data as well as any other clinical or 
healthcare use data could help the COMP establish if the basis for significant benefit is met.

Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Baraclude 
entecavir 
On 20 January 2010 the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal 
product Baraclude. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Bristol-Myers 
Squibb Pharma EEIG. They may request a re-examination of the CHMP opinion, provided that they 
notify the European Medicines Agency in writing of their intention within 15 days of receipt of the 
opinion. 
The CHMP adopted a new indication as follows: 
“Baraclude is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (see section 5.1) 
in adults with: 
• 
decompensated liver disease (see section 4.4)”. 
Detailed conditions for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after the variation to the 
marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission. 
For information, the full indications for Baraclude will be as follows2: 
Baraclude is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (see section 5.1) in 
adults with:  
• 
compensated liver disease and evidence of active viral replication, persistently elevated serum 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and histological evidence of active inflammation and/or 
fibrosis.

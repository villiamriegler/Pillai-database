1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH submitted on 08 July 2022 an extension of the marketing authorisation. 
The MAH applied for an addition of a new strength (0.1 mg/mL). The MAH applied for the following indication 
for COMIRNATY 0.1 mg/mL: Comirnaty 3 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is 
indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, in infants and children aged 
6 months to 4 years.  
1.2.  Legal basis

2.1.  Problem statement 
The MAH applies for an extension of the indication to children 6 months to <5 years of age to receive three 
doses of BNT162b2 3-µg (initial two doses 3 weeks apart followed by third dose at least 8 weeks after the 
second dose), based on Study C4591007 Phase 1 dose level-finding and Phase 2/3 selected-dose data on 
safety, tolerability, immune response, and supportive efficacy data from a population of approximately 4500 
children, among whom those who received a third dose of BNT162b2 had a median of at least 2 months of 
follow-up post-Dose 3. The clinical data are supplemented by a Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) 
package supporting a line extension for the BNT162b2 3-µg Tris/Sucrose presentation to enable paediatric 
dosing.

2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a zoonotic virus that first emerged as a human pathogen in China and 
has rapidly spread around the world by human-to-human transmission. At the time of this submission, the 
ongoing pandemic remains a significant challenge to public health, for which a licensed prophylactic vaccine 
is a necessary and critical mitigation across all age groups. The new strength formulation for BNT162b2 (3 
µg), Comirnaty 3 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection, includes a proposed extension of 
indication and dosing administration as follows: 
•  Proposed indication: Active immunization to prevent COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 
virus, in children aged 6 months to 4 years.  
•  Dosing administration: single 0.2-mL intramuscular (IM) dose followed by a second 0.2-mL dose 3 
weeks later and a third 0.2-mL dose at least 8 weeks after the second dose. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
All ages may present with the disease, but notably, case fatality rates (CFR) are elevated in persons >60 
years of age. Comorbidities are also associated with increased CFR, including cardiovascular disease, 
diabetes, hypertension, and chronic respiratory disease. Healthcare workers are over-represented among 
COVID-19 patients due to occupational exposure to infected patients.  
There are currently several vaccines approved for prevention of COVID-19 in adolescents, adults, elderly and 
children 5 to 11 years old. COVID-19 in children is mostly a mild disease although severe cases occur rarely, 
particularly in those with underlying, predisposing comorbidities. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus with four structural proteins. One of them, the Spike protein is a surface protein 
which binds the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) present on host cells. Therefore, the Spike protein 
is considered a relevant antigen for vaccine development. It has been shown that antibodies against the 
Spike protein neutralise the virus and prevent infection. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
COVID-19 presentation is generally with cough and fever, with chest radiography showing ground-glass 
opacities or patchy shadowing. However, many patients present without fever or radiographic changes, and 
infections may be asymptomatic which is relevant to controlling transmission. For symptomatic patients, 
disease progression may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring ventilation, subsequent multi-
organ failure, and death.  
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defined COVID-19 symptoms as including 1 or 
more of the following: fever, new or increased cough, new or increased shortness of breath, chills, new or 
increased muscle pain, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, diarrhoea, vomiting, fatigue, headache, nasal 
congestion or runny nose, or nausea.

2.1.5.  Management 
While care for individuals who have COVID-19 has improved with clinical experience, vaccination is the most 
effective medical countermeasure to decrease risk and mitigate spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus during the 
ongoing pandemic. Currently, there is no approved vaccine against COVID-19 in EU for children below 5 
years of age. 
2.2.  About the product 
Conditional marketing authorization was granted for Comirnaty 30 µg by the European Commission (EC) on 
21 December 2020 for individuals ≥16 years of age and was later expanded on 28 May 2021 to include 
individuals ≥12 years of age. Comirnaty 10 µg for children 5-<12 years of age was approved in EU on 26 
November 2021. The conditional marketing authorisation was converted into a standard marketing 
authorisation, granted on the 10 October 2022. 
The vaccine is based on SARS CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S) antigens encoded in RNA formulated in lipid 
nanoparticles (LNPs) and is referred to as BNT162b2 (BioNTech code number BNT162, Pfizer code number PF 
07302048). The structural elements of the vector backbones of BNT162 vaccines are optimized for prolonged 
and strong translation of the antigen-encoding RNA. The potency of RNA vaccines is further optimized by 
encapsulation of the RNA into LNPs, which protect the RNA from degradation by RNAses and enable 
transfection of host cells after IM delivery. 
The vaccine as 2 dose primary series is presently indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 
caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, in individuals 12 years of age and older as 30 µg per dose and for individuals 5-
11 years of age as 10 µg per dose. In current application, the formulation for children at ages between 6 
months to 4 years contains 3 µg per dose and primary series contain 3 doses. 
2.3.  Quality aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Pfizer and BioNTech have developed the COMIRNATY vaccine to prevent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-
19) caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine is based on SARS CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein antigens 
encoded in RNA and formulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). The COMIRNATY vaccine is also referred to as 
COVID-19 Vaccine (BioNTech code number BNT162b2, Pfizer code number PF 07302048). 
Two formulations of the BNT162b2 vaccine, designated PBS/Sucrose and Tris/Sucrose, have been developed 
which primarily differ in the buffer used for finished product formulation and the requirement for dilution prior 
to administration. This application is related to the Tris/Sucrose finished product only, which is formulated as 
0.1 mg/mL RNA in 10 mM Tris buffer, 300 mM sucrose, pH 7.4. The Tris/Sucrose formulation is currently 
authorized for the 30 and 10 μg RNA dosages, where the strengths differ from each other and from the 
proposed 3 μg RNA dose exclusively due to the filling volume and requirement for dilution prior to 
administration as described below: 
- 
The 30 μg RNA dosage presentation is filled at 2.25 mL per vial and is administered without dilution, 
providing 6 doses, each containing a 30 μg RNA dose in 0.3 mL injection volume for individuals 12+ 
years of age. 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/890761/2022 
Page 9/155 
 
 
- 
The 10 μg RNA dosage is filled at 1.3 mL per vial and requires dilution with 1.3 mL 0.9% sodium 
chloride prior to administration, providing 10 doses, each containing a 10 μg RNA dose in 0.2 mL 
injection volume for individuals 5 to <12 years of age. 
The primary purpose of this submission is to provide details supporting the Tris/Sucrose finished product line 
extension to include the 3 μg RNA dose presentation, which is filled at 0.4 mL per vial. The 3 μg RNA 
presentation requires dilution with 2.2 mL 0.9% sodium chloride prior to administration and once diluted 
provides 10 doses, each containing a 3 μg RNA dose in 0.2 mL injection volume. Supporting details for the 3 
μg RNA dose are provided in this application, with Process Performance Qualification (PPQ) lots FT9142 and 
FW9711 manufactured at commercial scale at the Pfizer Puurs site and filled into vials at 0.4 mL fill volume. 
Reference is made to Procedure EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0077, which includes details for Tris/Sucrose PPQ5b lot 
FK5128 filled at 0.4 mL fill volume. Lot FK5128 was successfully validated and complied with the predefined 
protocol acceptance criteria for Tris/Sucrose finished product. 
2.3.2.  Active Substance 
The active substance used to manufacture the Tris/Sucrose finished products (30 micrograms/dose, 10 
micrograms/dose and 3 micrograms/dose) is identical to that used for the currently approved PBS/Sucrose 
finished product. Consequently, there are no changes to the active substance sections and full reference is 
made to the active substance data of Comirnaty, concentrate for dispersion for injection (EMEA/H/C/005735). 
2.3.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2 . 3 . 3 . 1 .     Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
The finished product is a preservative-free, sterile dispersion of RNA-containing lipid nanoparticles in an 
aqueous cryoprotectant buffer for intramuscular injection. There are two formulations of Comirnaty vaccine, 
one designated PBS/Sucrose or Comirnaty concentrate for dispersion for injection which received a 
conditional approval in December 2020 and one designated Tris/Sucrose or Comirnaty dispersion for injection 
which received an approval in November 2021 (line extension EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0044). The primary 
difference is the buffer used for finished product formulation and requirement for dilution prior to 
administration. The Tris/Sucrose finished product (Comirnaty dispersion for injection) is formulated at 0.1 
mg/mL RNA in 10 mM Tris buffer, 300 mM sucrose, pH 7.4 and is filled into vials at 2.25 mL fill volume, 
providing 6 doses of 30 μg RNA in 0.3 mL injection volume. 
A recently approved line extension (EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0077) provided data in support of a 10 μg dosage 
presentation of Tris/Sucrose finished product for immunization of children 5-11 years of age. 
There are two approved dosages of the Tris/Sucrose finished product – 30 and 10 μg RNA per dose. The two 
doses differ only in the fill volume and requirement for dilution prior to administration for the 10 µg RNA per 
dose: 
- 
The 30 μg RNA dose is filled at 2.25 mL fill volume and is administered without dilution, providing 6 
doses, each a 30 μg RNA dose in 0.3 mL injection volume. 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/890761/2022 
Page 10/155 
 
 
- 
The 10 μg RNA dose is filled at 1.3 mL fill volume and requires dilution with 1.3 mL 0.9% sodium 
chloride prior to administration, providing 10 doses, each a 10 μg RNA dose in 0.2 mL injection 
volume. 
The purpose of this submission is to provide details supporting the Tris/Sucrose finished product line 
extension to include the 3 μg RNA dose presentation, which is filled at 0.4 mL per vial. The 3 μg RNA 
presentation requires dilution with 2.2 mL 0.9% sodium chloride prior to administration and once diluted 
provides 10 doses, each containing a 3 μg RNA dose in 0.2 mL injection volume. 
The formulation is identical for the 30, 10 and 3 μg RNA/dose-presentations and differ only in fill volume. The 
formulation includes four lipids as well as some other excipients that are identical with the composition of the 
currently approved 30 and 10 μg RNA/dose-presentations. 
The composition of the finished product, including quality standard, function, concentration and amount per 
dose for the 30, 10, and 3 μg doses are provided in Table P.1-1, Table P.1-2 and Table P.1-3, respectively.

The container closure system for the commercial BNT162b2 Tris/Sucrose finished product is a 2 mL Type I 
borosilicate or aluminosilicate glass vial and a 13 mm bromobutyl stopper. For further information and 
assessor´s comments regarding the vial, stopper and seal components, see section 3.2.P.7. 
The processing aids used in the manufacture have been specified in the composition together with a foot note 
that they are essentially removed through the manufacturing process and are not considered as ingredients 
(excipients). 
This is found acceptable. 
Pharmaceutical development 
The major part of the content in section P.2 for the Tris/Sucrose finished product is contained in the dossier 
for already approved Line extensions EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0044 and in EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0077. However, 
the section P.2 has been updated in various parts in this Line extension EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0138. 
QTPP 
The QTPP that was developed for the Tris/sucrose finished product has been updated to include the finished 
product 3 μg dosage presentation, filled at 0.4 mL fill volume. No changes were made to the currently 
approved 30 and 10 μg dosage presentations. 
Finished product 
The Tris/Sucrose finished product is formulated at 0.1 mg/mL RNA in Tris buffer and sucrose and is filled into 
vials at 2.25 mL fill volume, providing 6 doses of 30 μg RNA in 0.3 mL injection volume

(EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0044), filled into vials at 1.3 mL fill volume, providing 10 doses of 10 μg RNA in 0.2 
mL injection volume after dilution with 0.9% sodium chloride (EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0077) and this specific 
line extension (EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0138) supports a 3 μg dosage presentation of Tris/Sucrose finished 
product for immunization of infants and children from 6 months to  4 years of age. The three doses 30 μg, 10 
μg and 3 μg differ only in the fill volume and requirement for dilution prior to administration for the 10 µg 
and 3 μg RNA per dose. 
Acceptable results have been provided demonstrating that the target fill volume for the 3 μg finished product 
when diluted at the point of use with 0.9% sodium chloride is suitable for delivering 10 doses of 3 μg at 0.2 
mL per multi-dose vial. This study includes assessment of hold-up volume and delivered dose volume for 3 
μg dose vials after dilution with 0.9% sodium chloride. The provided results also show that the 2 mL vial can 
comprise a total volume of 2.6 mL, corresponding to 0.4 mL of finished product and 2.2 mL 0.9% sodium 
chloride, as well as give an acceptable indication of appropriate mixing of the solution. These results also 
show that 10 doses can be delivered for the 3 μg dose-presentation with the use of low dead-space syringes 
and needles. 
There are no formula overages in the finished product, only an overfill which has been acceptably justified. 
In summary, the section on finished product has been acceptably updated to include finished product filled at 
0.4 mL fill volume for 3 μg doses. 
Process development and characterization 
The section on process development and characterization has been updated with results and details from a 
thawing study to determine the time required for complete thawing of the 3 µg dosage presentation and 0.4 
mL fill volume. The provided results show that the thawing time required is 15 minutes at room temperature 
and 30 minutes at 2-8 °C for single vials filled at 0.4 mL and 30 minutes at room temperature and 90 
minutes at 2-8 °C for the 10-count pack. The information provided is found sufficient. 
Container closure system 
The container closure system for the commercial Tris/Sucrose finished product is a 2 mL Type I borosilicate 
or aluminosilicate glass vial and 13 mm bromobutyl rubber stopper and is compliant with the compendial 
requirements of the Ph. Eur. and is further addressed in section P.7. 
The dossier has been updated with satisfactory data from a study on penetrability, fragmentation and self-
sealing capacity to support 11 punctures of the 3 µg dose/0.4 mL vial.  
The development of the container closure system is found sufficiently presented and this is found acceptable. 
Compatibility 
The administration simulation and compatibility studies performed for the Tris/Sucrose finished product for 
the 3 µg presentation including 0.4 mL fill volume demonstrate physical and chemical stability of undiluted 
and diluted finished product for up to 24 hours at ambient temperature in vials. These studies also 
demonstrate stability of both undiluted and diluted finished product in syringes for 12 hours at ambient 
temperature or 24 hours at refrigerated temperature (2-8 °C). 
In addition, the microbial studies performed for the Tris/Sucrose finished products with samples containing 
0.9% sodium chloride to challenge the highest salt concentration and lowest pH, supports a hold time of up 
to 12 hours at up to 25 °C following first puncture of the stopper for the 3 µg presentation. Based on 
physicochemical stability and microbial in-use growth results, Tris/Sucrose finished product vials (for all three

fill volumes, 2.25 mL, 1.3 mL and 0.4 mL fill volume) may be held at ambient temperatures for up to 24 
hours, but once punctured, either for dilution or first use, may be held at 2°C to 25°C and should be used or 
discarded within 12 hours. 
In summary, compatibility of the Tris/sucrose finished product with 0.4 mL fill volume is acceptably 
demonstrated by compatibility studies provided on physicochemical stability and microbial in-use hold time.  
2.3.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing sites and the manufacturing process are the same as for the Tris/Sucrose finished product 
Comirnaty dispersion for injection 30 micrograms/dose (EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0044) and 10 micrograms/dose 
(EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0077) except for a different fill volume. The GMP compliance of these sites has been 
previously confirmed. 
The manufacturing process consists of four major manufacturing steps – LNP fabrication, bulk finished 
product formation, sterile filtration and aseptic filling. 
The commercial batch size is XX L of finished product solution corresponding to approximately XX vials at 0.4 
mL fill volume. The batch size range is similar to the approved original Tris/Sucrose vaccine. The 
manufacturing process is sufficiently described, and suitable in-process controls (IPCs) are applied. 
Process validation has been performed on two Process Performance Qualification (PPQ) batches at XX L bulk 
finished product manufactured at Pfizer Puurs. The batches are split into 1.3 mL and 0.4 mL fill volume sub-
batches. All data complies with the pre-specified criteria and sufficiently demonstrate that the manufacturing 
process is robust and provide a finished product with adequate quality. Since only the fill volume differs from 
the approved Tris/Sucrose vaccines 30 micrograms/dose and 10 micrograms/dose, the process validation for 
these products is considered as supportive, and the provided data is sufficient for process validation. 
2.3.3.3.  Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
The finished product specifications at release and shelf life provided in Table P.5-1 include tests for 
Appearance (Visual), Appearance (Visible Particulates), Subvisible Particles (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), 
Osmolality (Osmometry), LNP Size (Dynamic Light Scattering), LNP Polydispersity (Dynamic Light 
Scattering), RNA Encapsulation (Fluorescence assay), RNA content (Fluorescence assay), ALC-0315 content 
(HPLC-CAD), ALC-0159 content (HPLC-CAD), DSPC content (HPLC-CAD), Cholesterol content (HPLC-CAD), 
vial content (volume) (USP), Lipid identities (HPLC-CAD), Identity of encoded RNA sequence (RT-PCR), 
Potency / in Vitro Expression (Cell-based flow cytometry), RNA Integrity (Capillary Gel Electrophoresis), 
Bacterial Endotoxin (Ph. Eur.), Sterility (Ph. Eur.) and Container Closure Integrity (Dye incursion). For all 
quality attributes tested on stability except for RNA integrity and LNP size, the acceptance criteria for release 
and stability testing throughout shelf life are the same. 
The specifications and justifications of specifications for the Tris/Sucrose finished product are based on the 
specifications as contained in the dossier for the already approved Line extensions EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0044 
and EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0077. The acceptance criteria that differ between the specifications included in the 
approved Line extensions EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0044 and EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0077 and this specific applied 
Line extension EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0138 is only the vial content (volume), not less than 0.376 mL (for 0.4 
mL fill volume). 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/890761/2022 
Page 15/155 
 
 
The vial content (volume) for the Tris/Sucrose finished product was determined to ensure that each 0.4 mL 
filled vial can deliver ten 10 μg doses of 0.2 mL each, following the addition of 2.2 mL 0.9% sodium chloride. 
The provided justification for vial content (volume) of 0.4 fill volume is found acceptable. 
Batch analysis 
The section on batch analysis data have been updated with release data for the 3 µg presentation/0.4 mL fill 
volume for two PPQ lots FT9142 and FW9711. In addition, release data from PPQ lot FK5128 filled at 0.4 mL 
was supplied in the previous line extension EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0077 and is resubmitted in this application. 
All these three PPQ lots met all the release specifications of the specifications document in P.5.1. 
The specification, analytical procedures and batch data are found acceptable, and no issues are raised. 
Reference standard 
Reference standards or material are identical to the already approved Tris/sucrose finished products of the 30 
µg-presentation (EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0044) and the 10 µg-presentation (EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0077). 
Container closure system 
The container closure system for the commercial Tris/Sucrose finished product is a 2 mL Type I borosilicate 
or aluminosilicate glass vial and 13 mm bromobutyl rubber stopper, are compliant with the compendial 
requirements of the Ph. Eur. and is identical to the already approved Tris/sucrose finished products of the 30 
µg-presentation (EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0044) and the 10 µg-presentation (EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0077). 
2.3.3.4.  Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf life for this presentation is the same as the approved shelf-life for the existing 
Tris/Sucrose finished products; 12 months when stored at the recommended long-term storage condition of -
90 to -60 °C. Additionally, 10 weeks storage at 2-8 °C is approved at the point of use within the 6 months 
shelf-life. This 12 months shelf-life is based on the results provided in the recently approved line extensions 
EMEA/H/C/005735/0044 (30 μg/dose/2.25 mL fill volume) and EMEA/H/C/005735/0077 (10 μg/dose/1.3 mL 
fill volume) as well as from stability results for the 3 μg/dose/0.4 mL fill volume in this specific line extension 
EMEA/H/C/005735/0138. 
Stability for the 0.4 mL presentation is based on the 0.1 mg/mL Tris/Sucrose finished product which covers 
all three dosage presentations, 30, 10 and 3 μg. Stability results are provided for three commercial scale PPQ 
batches for the 3 μg presentation at 0.4 mL fill volume (PPQ batches FK5128, FT9142 and FW9711). Stability 
data are available from on-going studies at long term storage conditions of -90 to -60°C (up to 6 months 
data) and additional storage conditions at -20±5°C and 5±3°C (up to 3 months data). 6 months long-term 
stability data are provided for batches FK5128 and FT9142 and 3 months data for batch FW9711. The 
stability data from PPQ lot FK5128 supporting the 3 μg dose (0.4 mL fill volume) was submitted with a 
previous application and is referenced in this application for completeness. 
The stability samples are packaged in the currently registered glass vials used for commercial packaging.  
The stability results met all acceptance criteria in the finished product specifications document. 
Based on the totality of stability data available for the Tris/Sucrose finished product as well as the fact that 
the only difference between the 30 μg, 10 μg and 3 μg dosage presentations is the fill volume, 2.25 mL and 
1.3 mL versus 0.4 mL, the proposed shelf-life of 12 months at the recommended long-term storage condition 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/890761/2022 
Page 16/155 
 
 
of -90 to -60 °C and the additional 10 weeks storage at 2-8 °C at the point of use, is agreed to for the 3 μg 
dosage presentation. 
Post-approval stability protocol and stability commitment 
No information is provided in section 3.2.P.8.2. However, the applicant has confirmed that the identical Post-
approval stability protocol and stability commitment in section 3.2.P.8.2 is valid for the 3 μg dosage 
presentation as for the 30 μg- and 10 μg-presentations of the Tris/Sucrose finished product. 
2.3.3.5.  Post approval change management protocol(s) 
Not applicable. 
2.3.3.6.  Adventitious agents 
The active substance used to manufacture the Tris/Sucrose finished products (30 micrograms/dose, 10 
micrograms/dose and 3 micrograms/dose) is identical to that used for the currently approved PBS/Sucrose 
finished product. Consequently, there are no changes to the active substance sections and full reference is 
made to the active substance data of Comirnaty, concentrate for dispersion for injection (EMEA/H/C/005735). 
Adequate testing for bioburden, endotoxins and sterility are also included at appropriate stages of the 
manufacturing process of the finished product. 
2.3.3.7.  GMO 
Not applicable. 
2.3.4.  Discussion and conclusions on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
The Tris/Sucrose finished product is formulated at 0.1 mg/mL RNA in 10 mM Tris buffer, 300 mM sucrose, pH 
7.4. There are three dosages of the Tris/Sucrose finished product – 30, 10 and 3 μg RNA per dose. The three 
doses differ only in the fill volume and requirement for dilution prior to administration: 
- 
- 
The 30 μg RNA dose is filled at 2.25 mL fill volume and is administered without dilution, providing 6 
doses, each a 30 μg RNA dose in 0.3 mL injection volume. 
The 10 μg RNA dose is filled at 1.3 mL fill volume and requires dilution with 1.3 mL 0.9% sodium 
chloride prior to administration, providing 10 doses, each a 10 μg RNA dose in 0.2 mL injection 
volume. 
- 
The 3 μg RNA dose is filled at 0.4 mL fill volume and requires dilution with 2.2 mL 0.9% sodium 
chloride prior to administration, providing 10 doses, each a 3 μg RNA dose in 0.2 mL injection 
volume.  
The section on pharmaceutical development is found sufficiently comprehensive and acceptable. 
The manufacturing sites and the manufacturing process are the same as for the already approved 
Tris/Sucrose finished product, 30 μg/dose (EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0044) and 10 μg/dose 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/890761/2022 
Page 17/155 
 
 
(EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0077) except for a different fill volume. The manufacturing process is sufficiently 
described, and suitable in-process controls (IPCs) are applied. 
Process validation has been satisfactorily performed on two Process Performance Qualification (PPQ) batches 
at XX L bulk finished product manufactured at Pfizer Puurs and this is found sufficient. 
The specifications document for the Tris/Sucrose finished product includes a comprehensive set of relevant 
tests and the proposed acceptance criteria are found acceptable and adequately justified for all quality 
attributes included and no issues are raised. 
The proposed 12 months shelf-life at -90 to -60 °C and 10 weeks storage at 2-8 °C at the point of use within 
the 6 months shelf-life is agreed to. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

2.5.2.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.2.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Phase 1 was the open- label dose level-finding part of the study, conducted in the US. Dose levels were 
tested in sentinel cohorts of children by age de-escalation, starting with the lowest dose level in the oldest 
age group. All participants were eligible to receive 2 doses of vaccine 21 days apart.  
For each age group, the dose level identified as safe and tolerable and immunogenic in C4591007 Phase 1 
was advanced for further evaluation in Phase 2/3. 
Phase 1 was planned to enrol 16 participants per dose level tested in each age group. The doses tested and 
selected in each age group in current application during Phase 1 were: 
•  2 to <5 years of age: dose levels 3, 10-µg 
– selected dose level 3-µg 
•  6 months to <2 years of age: dose level 3-µg 
– selected dose level 3-µg 
Inclusion criteria to be enrolled into Phase 1 of this study were healthy participants 6 months to <5 years of 
age who were determined by medical history, physical examination, and clinical judgment of the investigator 
to be eligible for inclusion in the study.  
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/890761/2022 
Page 19/155 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The primary objective was to describe the safety and tolerability profiles and immune responses of 
prophylactic BNT162b2 at each dose level in each age group.  
Baseline characteristics. In the evaluable immunogenicity population, most Phase 1 participants 6 months 
to <2 years of age were White (92.3%), with 7.7% Asian participants. There were 7.7% Hispanic/Latino 
participants.  The  median  age  was  16.0  months  and  69.2%  of  participants  were  male.  The  Phase  1 
participants 2 to <5 years of age were White (80.4%), with 4.3% Black or African American participants 
and  6.5%  Asian  participants,  and  other  race  groups  were  <10%.  There  were  2.2%  Hispanic/Latino 
participants. The median age was 3.0 years and 56.5% of participants were male. 
Immunogenicity results 7 days after dose 2. For children 2 to <5 years of age, BNT162b2 elicited robust and 
comparable SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers at 7 days after Dose 2 at both tested dose levels (3-µg and 
10-µg) in a population who was without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Phase 1 study. 
For children 6 months to <2 years of age, BNT162b2 elicited robust SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers at 7 
days after Dose 2 at the 3-µg dose level tested in a population who was without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 
infection. 
Overall, two doses of BNT162b2 3-µg elicited robust immune responses in children <5 years of age (see 
Tables below).

<5yo-Evaluable Immunogenicity population 
Safety. For children 2 to <5 years of age, higher frequencies and greater severity of reactogenicity to the 10-
µg dose level in comparison to the 3-µg dose level contributed to the decision to select a lower dose of 3 µg 
of BNT162b2 to proceed to Phase 2/3 for this age group. 
For children 6 months to <2 years of age, the single dose level of 3-µg dose level tested in Phase 1 was 
informed by observed safety results from Phase 1 participants in the 2 to <5 years of age group. The 3-µg 
dose level was well tolerated in children 6 months to <2 years of age, and the observed satisfactory safety 
profile of 3-µg given supported its selection as the final dose level of BNT162b2 to proceed to Phase 2/3 for 
this age group. 
Overall, two doses of BNT162b2 3-µg were well-tolerated in participants <5 years of age in Phase 1. 
Dose Selection Based on Phase 1 Data 
For participants 2 to <5 years of age, final dose selection of BNT162b2 was based on the similarity in post-
vaccination immunogenicity reflected in Day 7 post-Dose 2 GMTs across 3-µg and 10-µg dose levels, along 
with the more favourable reactogenicity profile observed at the 3-µg dose level compared to the 10-µg dose 
level. The totality of these results led to the selection of BNT162b2 at the 3-µg dose level to proceed to Phase 
2/3 evaluation for this age group. 
For participants 6 months to <2 years of age, based on the age de-escalation design of the Phase 1 study, 
the 3-µg dose level of BNT162b2 was the only dose level tested, and Phase 1 data showed a robust immune 
response and favourable reactogenicity profile for this dose level in this age group.

2.5.2.2.  Main studies 
Title of study: Phase 2/3 Study C4591007 
Methods 
Children 6 Months to <5 Years of Age: A Phase 2/3 Placebo- Controlled, Observer-Blinded Safety, Tolerability, 
and Immunogenicity Study of a SARS-CoV-2 RNA Vaccine Candidate Against COVID-19 in Healthy Children 
and Young Adults 
Two schemes were used (2-dose and 3-dose), but the company is only seeking approval for the 3-dose 
scheme so this assessment will solely focus on that subset of the study. 
Study Participants 
Inclusion criteria 
Enrolled into Phase 2/3 of this study were healthy participants 6 months to <5 years of age who were 
determined by medical history, physical examination, and clinical judgment of the investigator to be eligible 
for inclusion in the study. Eligibility permitted enrolment of participants with medical conditions such as 
stable Type 1 diabetes or hypothyroidism; stable and controlled HIV, HCV, or HBV infection; and past 
serological or microbiological evidence of prior (not active) SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants were 
randomized 2:1 to receive vaccine or placebo at sites in the US, Finland, Poland, Spain, and Brazil. 
Participants’ parent(s)/legal guardian(s) had to provide signed inform consent (and verbal or written assent 
from the participant if appropriate); they also had to be willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, 
treatment plans, laboratory tests, lifestyle considerations, and other study procedures. 
Exclusion criteria 
Exclusions from Phase 2/3 study participation included prior receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine or medication 
intended to prevent COVID-19, prior or current diagnosis of MIS-C, history of severe (ie, anaphylactic) 
reaction associated with any vaccine or allergy to any component of the study intervention (ie, BNT162b2), 
immunodeficiency or autoimmune disease requiring therapeutic intervention (other than diabetes) and other 
medical conditions and/or therapeutic interventions deemed incompatible with study participation. 
Treatments 
Participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either BNT162b2 (3 µg) or placebo (normal saline). 
Participants were eligible to receive a 3-dose regimen. Doses were administered IM into the deltoid muscle 
for children ≥2 years of age and into the anterior thigh muscle for children <2 years of age. There was 
approximately 21-day interval between dose 1 and dose 2, and at least 8 weeks between dose 2 and dose 3.  
The comparator group for immunobridging exercise consisted of participants 16 to 25 years of age from 
Phase 2/3 of the C4591001 study, receiving 2 doses of BNT162b2 (30 μg) with 21-day interval.

Sample size 
The Phase 2/3 selected-dose portion of the study was to randomize approximately 4500 participants 
(randomization ratio of 2:1 so that 3000 receive active vaccine and 1500 receive placebo) for each age 
group, with a total of approximately 13,500 participants. The total sample size in Phase 2/3 is not based on 
statistical hypothesis testing. 
Sample size for immunobridging Evaluation of 3-Dose Series 
For evaluation of the 3-dose series immunobridging objectives in the Phase 2/3 selected-dose evaluation 
portion of the study, approximately 200 participants in each of the younger age groups (≥6 months to <2 
years, ≥2 years to <5 years) who were enrolled prior to protocol amendment 6 and received 3 doses of 
BNT162b2 was to be selected and the same number of participants 16 to 25 years of age who received 2 
doses of BNT162b2 from Phase 2/3 of the C4591001 study were to be randomly selected as the 
immunobridging subset. To maintain blinding, approximately 100 participants in each age group from the 
C4591007 study and 50 participants 16 to 25 years of age from the C4591001 study who received placebo 
were also to be selected for serology testing. 
Assuming a non-evaluable rate of 35%, approximately 130 evaluable participants in each age group were 
approximated to contribute to the immunobridging evaluation. 
Assuming that the assay standard deviation at 1 month after Dose 3 and 1 month after Dose 2 in log scale is 
0.93 based on data observed in the Phase 3 third-dose portion of the C4591001 study and the GMR of the 
younger age group to the 16- to 25-year age group is 1, 130 evaluable participants in each age group were 
to provide 93.3% power to demonstrate immunobridging success of each younger age group to the 16- to 
25-year age group based on GMR using a 1.5-fold margin. For comparisons based on seroresponse, a 95% 
response rate is assumed for each comparative group at the comparative time point. With 130 evaluable 
participants, the study had 90.4% power to show the immunobridging based on seroresponse rate using a 
10% margin. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Participants was to be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive active vaccine or placebo. 
Allocation (randomization) of participants to vaccine groups will proceed through the use of an IRT system 
(IWR). The site personnel were then provided with a vaccine assignment and randomization number from the 
IRT system, which provided a confirmation report containing the participant number, randomization number, 
and study intervention allocation assigned.

The study staff receiving, storing, dispensing, preparing, and administering the study interventions were to 
be unblinded. All other study and site personnel, including the investigator, investigator staff, and 
participants, were to be blinded to study intervention assignments. In particular, the individuals who evaluate 
participant safety were blinded. Because BNT162b2 and placebo are different in physical appearance, the 
study intervention syringes were be administered in a manner that prevented the study participants from 
identifying the study intervention type based on its appearance. Contact between the unblinded dispenser 
and study participants and unblinded administrator and study participants was to be kept to a minimum. The 
remaining site personnel were not to know study intervention assignments. 
At the 6-month follow-up visit, all participants were to be unblinded. Participants who originally received 
placebo were offered the opportunity to receive BNT162b2 as part of the study. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis methods 
Analyses for Binary Data The exact 95% CI for binary endpoints for each group were computed using the F 
distribution (Clopper-Pearson). The 95% CI for the between-group difference for binary endpoints were 
calculated using the Miettinen and Nurminen method. 
Analyses for Continuous Data A validated SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay was used to obtain titers 
(GMT) against the wild-type strain, with young adult group samples tested contemporaneously with pediatric 
group samples for comparability. Immunobridging success criteria were based on both the geometric mean 
ratio (GMR) of 50% neutralizing geometric mean titers (GMTs) and difference in seroresponse rates. 
The geometric means were calculated as the mean of the assay results after making the logarithm 
transformation and then exponentiating the mean to express results on the original scale. Two-sided 95% Cis 
were obtained by taking log transforms of assay results, calculating the 95% CI with reference to Student’s t 
distribution, and then exponentiating the confidence limits. 
The GMR were calculated as the mean of the difference of logarithmically transformed assay results (e.g., 
SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers in the younger age group minus that in 16- to 25-year age group) and 
exponentiating the mean. Two-sided CIs were obtained by calculating CIs using Student’s t distribution for 
the mean difference of the logarithmically transformed assay results and exponentiating the confidence 
limits. 
GMFRs are defined as ratios of the results after vaccination to the results before vaccination. GMFRs are 
limited to participants with non-missing values at both time points. GMFRs were calculated as the mean of 
the difference of logarithmically transformed assay results (later time point minus earlier time point) and 
exponentiating the mean. The associated 2-sided 95% CIs were obtained by constructing CIs using Student’s 
t distribution for the mean difference on the logarithm scale and exponentiating the confidence 
Seroresponse: defined as achieving a ≥4-fold rise in SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers from before Dose 1. If 
the baseline measurement was below LLOQ, post-vaccination measure of ≥4 × LLOQ was considered to be 
seroresponse. Data were summarized as the difference in percentages of participants achieving seroresponse 
and associated 2-sided 95% CI calculated using the Miettinen and Nurminen method. Immunobridging 
success was declared if the lower limit of the CI for difference in seroresponse rate was greater than -10% 
and provided that the GMR success criteria had been met.

GMTs and geometric fold-rises (GMFRs) were summarized with 2-sided 95% CIs obtained by taking log 
transforms of results, calculating CIs with reference to Student’s t-distribution, then exponentiating 
confidence limits. Titers below LLOQ were set to 0.5 × LLOQ. 
Variant Neutralization assay 
Descriptive analyses of SARS-CoV-2 variant neutralization were conducted on the Omicron neutralization 
subset. For each of the pediatric groups in Phase 2/3 Study C4591007, this included approximately 40 
BNT162b2 3-µg recipients and 5 placebo recipients randomly selected from the immunobridging subset who 
had received three doses of study intervention, were without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1-
month post-Dose 3 and had sufficient blood volume for testing at Dose 3 and 1-month post-Dose 3. The 
adult reference group from Phase 3 Study C4591001 included 40 participants 18 to 55 years of age randomly 
selected from the C4591001 evaluable immunogenicity population who had received a booster (third) dose of 
BNT162b2 30-µg at least 6 months after the second dose and were without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 
infection up to 1-month post-Dose 3. Samples from the C4591007 pediatric groups and C4591001 adult 
group were tested contemporaneously for comparability. 
A non-validated fluorescent focus reduction neutralization test (FFRNT) was used to determine SARS-CoV-2 
serum neutralizing titers before Dose 3 and 1-month post-Dose 3. The FFRNT is a non-validated assay similar 
to the 50% plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) assay which has been used to generate supportive 
data against the reference strain and other variants. The FFRNT assay has higher throughput and correlates 
well with the PRNT assay. All samples were tested at the same time to ensure comparability of results. 
The 50% FFRNT titers were determined against the designated wild-type reference strain, which is a 
recombinant USA-WA1/2020 (clinical strain isolated in January 2020), and against recombinant Delta and 
Omicron (BA.1) variants, which are recombinant viruses with the Delta or Omicron variant full spike gene on 
the genetic background of USA-WA1/2020. Titers obtained from the FFRNT assay were reported as GMTs and 
GMFRs as described above.

Missing data 
A partial AE start date (missing day or missing both month and day) was to be imputed by assigning the 
earliest possible start date using all available information. A complete missing start date for an AE was not 
allowed in the data collection. 
Values below the LLOQ for each assay, denoted as BLQ, were be set to 0.5 × LLOQ for analysis. However, 
this calculation could be adjusted based upon additional data from the assay.  
No additional imputation were applied to other missing data. 
Subgroup analyses  
For Phase 2/3, subgroup analyses based on sex, race, ethnicity, and baseline SARS-CoV-2 status were to be 
performed on all primary safety and immunogenicity endpoints (as supplemental analyses).

Multiplicity 
For the immunogenicity objectives of immunobridging of BNT162b2 after the 2-dose series in each of the 5 
age groups (≥16 to <18 years, ≥12 to <16 years, ≥5 to <12 years, ≥2 to <5 years, and ≥6 months to <2 
years of age) to the comparator group from Phase 2/3 of the C4591001 study, the hypothesis testing for 
each age group was to be carried out separately. Each immunobridging analysis corresponds to a separate 
analysis of the respective age group, with a separate objective. The age groups are included in the same 
study to improve operational efficiency. Therefore, no type I error adjustments was to be applied in the 
immunogenicity assessments for the 5 age groups. 
Within each age group, immunobridging based on GMR and seroresponse difference was to be assessed 
sequentially.  
The primary immunogenicity and secondary efficacy objectives after the 3-dose series for the ≥6-month to 
<2-year and ≥2- to <5-year age groups were to be evaluated separately from the objectives after 2-dose 
series. The hypothesis testing for immunobridging of the ≥6-month to <2-year and ≥2- to <5-year age 
groups was to be carried out separately in the same way as for the 2-dose series; no type I error 
adjustments were to be applied for the assessments of the 2 age groups for the same reason described 
above. If immunobridging success was declared for both age groups, the secondary efficacy objectives was to 
be tested sequentially in the order as stated for the 2 age groups combined. 
Interim analyses 
No formal interim analysis was to be conducted for this study, but statistical analyses were to be carried out 
when the final data for specified objectives are available while the study is ongoing.  
Results 
Recruitment 
The study started to recruit 24.03.2021 and is still ongoing. 
Conduct of the study 
The Phase 1/2/3 Study C4591007 was undertaken by Pfizer and BioNTech and conducted at a total of 84 
sites as of the data cutoff date (29 April 2022): 11 in Finland, 8 in Poland, 10 in Spain, and 55 in the US. 
There were an additional 2 study centers in the US that received study drug but did not enter any 
participants. For Phase 1, participants were entered at US sites only. 
The study was conducted by investigators contracted by and under the direction of Pfizer. The investigators 
were responsible for adhering to the study procedures described in the protocol, for keeping records of the 
study intervention, and for ensuring accurate completion of the CRFs and DCTs supplied by the sponsor. 
No sites were terminated from the study as of the Phase 2/3 data cutoff date (29 April 2022). 
The paediatric investigational Plan has label EMEA-002861-PIP02. The original protocol from 5.02.2021 has 
been amended 7 times: 5.03.2021, 6.08.2021, 10.09.2021, 29.09.2021, 15.11.2021, 4.01.2022 and 
10.03.2022. The 2 last amendments affected the results included in current application.

The Study Protocol Amendment 6 dated on 04.01.2022 focussed on age group below 5 years. The primary 
immunogenicity analysis demonstrated that the immune response elicited by BNT162b2 in participants ≥2 to 
<5 years of age (2 doses at 3 μg) did not meet immunobridging criteria when compared to participants 16 to 
25 years of age from the C4591001 study. As a result, and given the emerging data in individuals 16 years of 
age and older, an additional (third) dose of BNT162b2 was to be administered to all Phase 1 dose-finding and 
Phase 2/3 selected-dose participants and the protocol amended accordingly. Also, an additional 4500 Phase 
2/3 selected-dose participants ≥6 months to <2 years and ≥2 to <5 years of age are permitted to enrol to 
enlarge the size of the pediatric safety database. For participants <5 years of age, all positive RT-PCR cases 
confirmed by the central laboratory would undergo BioFire testing to detect coinfections. 
The Study Protocol Amendment 7 dated on 10.03.2022 added a relative VE objective for 3-dose BNT162b2 
from original active vaccine group vs 2-dose BNT162b2 from placebo crossover. The relative VE calculation 
for those receiving 3 doses of BNT162b2 is being compared to those who received 2 doses of BNT162b2 after 
originally receiving placebo (as opposed to comparing to those who received 2 doses of BNT162b2, as 
originally randomized) due to the emergence of different variants over time; the timing of cases for these 2 
groups are similar, therefore making it more likely to compare cases of the same variant. 
Immunogenicity Results post-dose 3 – Study C4591007, Phase 2/3 
Children 2 to <5 years of age: 
Disposition and Data Sets Analysed 
The Dose 3 evaluable immunogenicity population included 204 children 2 to <5 years of age who received 
three doses of BNT162b2 3-µg and 92 who received placebo, of whom 143 and 59 participants, respectively, 
were without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 3. The comparator group of 
young adults 16 to 25 years of age included 183 participants in the BNT162b2 30-µg group and 45 
participants in the placebo group of Study C4591001, of whom 170 and 38 participants, respectively, were 
without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2. 
Exclusions from the Dose 3 evaluable population were reported in similar proportions of the BNT162b2 
groups of the pediatric (6.4%) and adult (8.5%) populations, most due to lack of a valid and determinate 
assay immunogenicity result after Dose 3 or Dose 2, respectively. 
Among children 2 to <5 years of age in the immunobridging subset who received three doses of BNT162b2 3-
µg or placebo, 100% completed the 1-month post-Dose 3 visit. In the comparator adult group who received 
two doses of BNT162b2 30-µg or placebo, most (≥99.5%) completed the 1-month post-Dose 2 visit. 
All children 2 to <5 years of age in the immunobridging subset received all three doses of BNT162b2 3-µg, 
and all comparator adults 16 to 25 years of age received two doses of BNT162b2 30-µg. Most pediatric and 
adult participants (>85%) received Dose 2 within the protocol defined window of 19 to 23 days after Dose 1. 
Most pediatric participants in the immunobridging subset received Dose 3 of BNT162b2 3-µg at least 8 weeks 
after Dose 2, most commonly between 8 and <13 weeks post-Dose 2 (84.4%). The median timing of Dose 3 
administration after Dose 2 of BNT162b2 was 10.7 weeks (range: 8.1 to 15.6 weeks) and of placebo was 
10.7 weeks (range: 8.6 to 16.0 weeks).

Outcomes and estimation 
Immunobridging results are presented for 50% SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses against the 
wild-type strain, for participants in the evaluable immunogenicity population without prior evidence of SARS-
CoV-2 infection. Immunobridging success criteria were based on the GMR and difference in seroresponse 
rate, comparing neutralizing titers from children 2 to <5 years of age (1-month post-Dose 3) to those from 
young adults (1-month post-Dose 2). 
GMR of Neutralizing Titers – Children 2 to <5 Years of Age 
Among participants in the evaluable immunogenicity population without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 
infection, the GMR of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers in children 2 to <5 years of age (at 1-month post-
Dose 3 of BNT162b2 3-µg) compared to young adults 16 to 25 years of age (at 1-month post-Dose 2 of 
BNT162b2 30-µg) was 1.30 (2-sided 95% CI: 1.13, 1.50) (Table below). 
The lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for GMR was >0.67 and the GMR point estimate was >0.8 (protocol 
specified criterion) and >1.0 (requested by FDA), indicating the prespecified immunobridging success 
criterion for the GMR was met.

Difference in Seroresponse Rates – Children 2 to <5 Years of Age 
Among participants in the evaluable immunogenicity population without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 
infection, the difference in proportions who achieved seroresponse (≥4-fold rise in SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing 
titers from before Dose 1) among children 2 to <5 years of age (at 1-month post-Dose 3 of BNT162b2 3-µg) 
compared to young adults 16 to 25 years of age (at 1-month post-Dose 2 of BNT162b2 30-µg) was 1.2% (2-
sided 95% CI: -1.5%, 4.2%) (Table below). 
The lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in seroresponse rate was greater than -10%, and the 
immunobridging success criterion based on the GMR was achieved, indicating the prespecified 
immunobridging success criterion for difference in seroresponse was met.

Immunogenicity Population. 
SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Titers – Phase 2/3 – Children 2 to <5 Years of Age – Wild-type Strain 
Results from the evaluable immunogenicity population (regardless of evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection) 
and the all-available immunogenicity population were generally similar, noting that inclusion of individuals 
with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection typically results in elevated baseline (before vaccination) and post-
vaccination neutralizing titers compared with individuals without evidence of prior infection. 
Subgroup analyses based on demographic characteristics at baseline generally showed no meaningful 
differences in the immunogenicity profile. The subgroup with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection at 
baseline (‘baseline positive’) generally had higher neutralizing titers both at baseline (pre-vaccination) and 
post-vaccination compared with the ‘baseline negative’ subgroup, which is predictable in the setting of 
vaccinating after prior exposure. These should be interpreted with caution as some subgroups include a 
limited number of participants. 
Neutralizing titers are summarized below for children 2 to <5 years of age from before Dose 1 to 1-month 
post-Dose 3, and for young adults from before Dose 1 to 1-month post-Dose 2. 
GMTs – Children 2 to <5 Years of Age 
Among children 2 to <5 years of age in the evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of prior 
SARS-CoV-2 infection, the observed GMT before vaccination (20.7) was still robust at post-Dose 2 and prior 
to Dose 3 (401.1), and then substantially increased at 1-month post-Dose 3 (1535.2) (Table below). In the 
comparator group of young adults 16 to 25 years of age, the observed GMT before vaccination (21.3) was 
substantial increased at 1-month post-Dose 2 (1180.0).

month post-Dose 3 was 73.3 (2-sided 95% CI: 66.3, 81.1) (Table below). The GMFR from before Dose 3 to 
1-month post-Dose 3 was 3.8 (2-sided 95% CI: 3.5, 4.2). In the comparator group of young adults 16 to 25 
years of age, the GMFR of SARS-CoV-2 50% serum neutralizing titers from before vaccination to 1-month

SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Titers – Phase 2/3 – Children 2 to <5 Years of Age – Omicron and Delta 
Variants 
Non validated FFRNT assay results are summarized below for the Omicron neutralization subset of the 
evaluable immunogenicity population without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Titers were obtained in 
the FFRNT assay against Omicron and Delta variants and a wild-type reference strain. 
Results in the evaluable immunogenicity population (regardless of evidence of prior infection) and the all-
available immunogenicity population were generally similar, noting that inclusion of individuals with prior 
SARS-CoV-2 infection typically results in elevated baseline (before vaccination) and post-vaccination 
neutralizing titers compared with individuals without evidence of prior infection. 
GMTs – Children 2 to <5 Years of Age 
Among 34 children 2 to <5 years of age without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection who received three 
doses of BNT162b2 3-µg, neutralizing GMTs prior to vaccination with Dose 3 against Delta (68.0) and 
Omicron (14.0) were increased at 1-month post-Dose 3 with respect to both Delta (471.4) and Omicron 
(82.5) (Table below). Correspondingly, increases were also observed for the reference strain from before 
Dose 3 (70.1) to 1-month post-Dose 3 (471.4). 
Similar patterns were observed for 40 adults 18 to 55 years of age without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 
infection who received three doses of BNT162b2 30-µg, for whom neutralizing GMTs prior to vaccination with 
Dose 3 against Delta (36.4) and Omicron (12.7) were increased at 1-month post-Dose 3 with respect to both 
Delta (1153.6) and Omicron (340.0) titers. Increases were also observed for the reference strain from before 
Dose 3 (33.9) to 1-month post-Dose 3 (1067.1). 
Notably, the dosing interval between Dose 2 and Dose 3 in adults was approximately 6 months, as compared 
with the dosing interval between Dose 2 and Dose 3 in the pediatric age group of approximately 2 to 3 
months. The longer interval, as well as potential differences in antibody waning over time, may contribute to 
the higher increase in GMTs observed in adults as compared to the pediatric population. 
Noting that adults had a longer dosing interval between Dose 2 and Dose 3 (approximately  6 months) at a 
time when antibody levels may be waning and the effects of a booster may be more pronounced, compared 
with children in this age group (approximately 2 to 3 months), a higher GMFR in the adults compared to the 
pediatric population may be expected.

GMFR – Children 2 to <5 Years of Age 
For children 2 to <5 years of age without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection who received three doses of 
BNT162b2 3-µg, there was an observed 6.9-fold increase in Delta and 5.9-fold increase in Omicron 
neutralizing titers obtained in the FFRNT assay from before Dose 3 to 1-month post-Dose 3 (Table below). 
The GMFR for the reference strain from before Dose 3 to 1-month post-Dose 3 was 6.7. 
For adults 18 to 55 years of age without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection who received three doses of 
BNT162b2 30-µg, there was an observed 31.7-fold increase in Delta and 26.7-fold increase in Omicron 
neutralizing titers obtained in the FFRNT assay from before Dose 3 to 1-month post-Dose 3. The GMFR for 
the reference strain from before Dose 3 to 1-month post- Dose 3 was 31.5.

Updated Supportive Analysis 
An additional descriptive immunogenicity analysis of Omicron neutralizing titers was conducted using the 
FFRNT assay, to compare children with adults who received a third dose of BNT162b2 at a similar interval 
between Dose 2 and Dose 3. This analysis compared Phase 2/3 pediatric participants in Study C4591007 with 
a subset of adults 18 to 50 years of age in Phase 3 Study C4591017 (lot consistency study) who had received 
a two-dose primary series followed by a booster (third) dose of BNT162b2 30-µg. The dosing interval 
between Dose 2 and Dose 3 was a median of 13.0 weeks (range: 11.9 to 14.3 weeks) for adults and 10.6 
weeks (range: 8.6 to 13.7 weeks) for children 2 to <5 years of age. At 1-month post-Dose 3, among 34 
children 2 to <5 years of age without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, the neutralizing GMT was 
114.3; correspondingly, among 27 adults 18 to 50 years of age without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 
infection, the neutralizing GMT at 1-month post-Dose 3 was 164.2. These data show that for populations who 
received three doses of BNT162b2 at the age-appropriate dose level and administered at a comparable 
dosing interval, the Omicron specific neutralization titers are very similar across pediatric population and an 
adult comparator group (18 to 50 years of age) for whom high efficacy was observed. 
Children 6 months to <2 years of age: 
Disposition and Data Sets Analysed 
The Dose 3 evaluable immunogenicity population included 132 children 6 months to <2 years of age who 
received three doses of BNT162b2 3-µg and 67 who received placebo, of whom 82 and 49 participants, 
respectively, were without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 3 (Table below). 
The comparator group of young adults 16 to 25 years of age included 183 participants in the BNT162b2 30-
µg group and 45 participants in the placebo group of Study C4591001, of whom 170 and 38 participants, 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation

Page 38/155 
 
 
 
respectively, were without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2. (Note: this is 
the same adult group used for immunobridging analysis for the 2 to <5 years of age group.) 
Exclusions from the Dose 3 evaluable population were reported in similar proportions of the BNT162b2 
groups of the pediatric (10.8%) and adult (8.5%) populations, most due to lack of a valid and determinate 
assay immunogenicity result after Dose 3 or Dose 2, respectively. 
Among children 6 months to <2 years of age in the immunobridging subset who received three doses of 
BNT162b2 3-µg or placebo, 100% completed the 1-month post-Dose 3 visit. In the comparator adult group 
who received two doses of BNT162b2 30-µg or placebo, most (>99.5%) completed the 1-month post-Dose 2 
visit. 
Vaccine Administration and Timing – Children 6 Months to <2 Years of Age 
All children 6 months to <2 years of age in the immunobridging subset received all three doses of BNT162b2 
3-µg, and all comparator adults 16 to 25 years of age received two doses of BNT162b2 30-µg. Most pediatric 
and adult participants (>88.5%) received Dose 2 within the protocol defined window of 19 to 23 days after 
Dose 1. 
Most pediatric participants in the immunobridging subset received Dose 3 of BNT162b2 3-µg at least 8 weeks 
after Dose 2, most commonly between 8 and <13 weeks post-Dose 2 (50.0%). The median timing of Dose 3 
administration after Dose 2 of BNT162b2 was 12.9 weeks (range: 8.6 to 20.0 weeks) and of placebo was 
12.2 weeks (range: 8.4 to 20.0 weeks). 
Baseline data 
Demographics of the evaluable immunogenicity population without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up 
to 1 month after Dose 3 of BNT162b2 3-µg, which was comprised of 82 participants 6 months to <2 years of 
age, are included in table below. The adult comparator population is also shown for reference. 
In total, most participants in this pediatric population were White (72.0%). The median age was 16.0 months 
and 62.2% of participants were male. In the evaluable immunogenicity population (regardless of evidence of 
prior infection), 6/132 participants (4.5%) were baseline positive for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Outcomes and estimation 
Immunobridging results are presented for 50% SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses against the 
wild-type strain, for participants in the evaluable immunogenicity population without prior evidence of SARS-
CoV-2 infection. Immunobridging success criteria were based on the GMR and difference in seroresponse 
rate, comparing neutralizing titers from children 6 months to <2 years of age (1-month post-Dose 3) those 
from young adults (1-month post-Dose 2). 
GMR of Neutralizing Titers – Children 6 Months to <2 Years of Age 
Among participants in the evaluable immunogenicity population without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 
infection, the GMR of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers in children 6 months to <2 years of age (at 1-
month post-Dose 3 of BNT162b2 3-µg) compared to young adults 16 to 25 years of age (at 1-month post-
Dose 2 of BNT162b2 30-µg) was 1.19 (2-sided 95% CI: 1.00, 1.42) (Table below). 
The lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for GMR was >0.67 and the GMR point estimate was >0.8 (protocol 
specified criterion) and >1.0 (requested by FDA), indicating the prespecified immunobridging success 
criterion for the GMR was met.

Difference in Seroresponse Rates – Children 6 Months to <2 Years of Age 
Among participants in the evaluable immunogenicity population without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 
infection, the difference in proportions who achieved seroresponse among children 6 months to <2 years of 
age (at 1-month post-Dose 3 of BNT162b2 3-µg) compared to young adults 16 to 25 years of age (at 1-
month post-Dose 2 of BNT162b2 30-µg) was 1.2% (2-sided 95% CI: -3.4%, 4.2%) (Table below). 
The lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in seroresponse rate was greater than -10%, and the 
immunobridging success criterion based on the GMR was achieved, indicating the prespecified 
immunobridging success criterion for difference in seroresponse was met.

Evaluable Immunogenicity Population. 
SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Titers – Phase 2/3 – Children 6 Months to <2 Years of Age – Wild-Type 
Strain 
Immunogenicity results are presented for 50% SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses against the wild-
type strain, for participants in the evaluable immunogenicity population without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-
2 infection. Results from the evaluable immunogenicity population (regardless of evidence of prior SARS-CoV-
2 infection) and the all-available immunogenicity population were generally similar, noting that inclusion of 
individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection typically results in elevated baseline (before vaccination) and 
post-vaccination neutralizing titers compared with individuals without evidence of prior infection. 
Subgroup analyses based on demographic characteristics at baseline generally showed no meaningful 
differences in the immunogenicity profile. The subgroup with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection at 
baseline (‘baseline positive’) generally had higher neutralizing titers both at baseline (pre-vaccination) and 
post-vaccination compared with the ‘baseline negative’ subgroup, which is predictable in the setting of 
vaccinating after prior exposure. These should be interpreted with caution as some subgroups include a 
limited number of participants.

Neutralizing titers are summarized below for children 6 months to <2 years of age from before Dose 1 to 1-
month post-Dose 3, and for young adults from before Dose 1 to 1-month post- Dose 2. 
GMTs – Children 6 Months to <2 Years of Age 
Among children 6 months to <2 years of age in the evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of 
prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, the observed GMT before vaccination (20.8) was still robust at post-Dose 2 and 
prior to Dose 3 (317.0), and then substantially increased at 1-month post-Dose 3 (1406.5) (Table below). In 
the comparator group of young adults 16 to 25 years of age, the observed GMT before vaccination (21.3) 
was substantially increased at 1-month post-Dose 2 (1180.0).

GMFRs – Children 6 Months to <2 Years of Age 
Among children 6 months to <2 years of age in the evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of

to 1-month post-Dose 3 was 68.4 (2-sided 95% CI: 58.2, 80.4) (Table below). The GMFR from before Dose 3 
to 1-month post-Dose 3 was 4.4 (2-sided 95% CI: 3.8, 5.2). In the comparator group of young adults 16 to 
25 years of age, the GMFR of SARS-CoV-2 50% serum neutralizing titers from before vaccination to 1-month 
post-Dose 2 was 55.3 (2-sided 95% CI: 49.6, 61.6).

Seroresponse Rates – Children 6 Months to <2 Years of Age 
Among children 6 months to <2 years of age in the evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of 
prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, the seroresponse rate from before vaccination to 1-month post-Dose 3 was 
100% (2-sided 95% CI: 95.5%, 100%) (Table below). In the comparator group of young adults 16 to 25

Ancillary analyses 
SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Titers – Phase 2/3 – Children 6 Months to <2 Years of Age – Omicron 
and Delta Variants 
Non validated FFRNT assay results are summarized below for the Omicron neutralization subset of the 
evaluable immunogenicity population without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Titers were obtained in 
the FFRNT assay against Omicron and Delta variants and a wild-type reference strain. 
Results in the evaluable immunogenicity population (regardless of evidence of prior infection) and the all-
available immunogenicity population were generally similar, noting that inclusion of individuals with prior 
SARS-CoV-2 infection typically results in elevated baseline (before vaccination) and post-vaccination 
neutralizing titers compared with individuals without evidence of prior infection. 
Note that the adult booster population used for reference in this analysis is the same as included for the 2 to 
<5 years of age group. 
GMTs – Children 6 Months to <2 Years of Age 
Among 32 children 6 months to <2 years of age without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection who received 
three doses of BNT162b2 3-µg, neutralizing GMTs prior to vaccination with Dose 3 against Delta (94.1) and 
Omicron (16.3) were increased at 1-month post-Dose 3 with respect to both Delta (606.3) and Omicron

(127.5) (Table below). Correspondingly, increases were also observed for the reference strain from before 
Dose 3 (103.7) to 1-month post-Dose 3 (640.0). 
Similar patterns were observed for 40 adults 18 to 55 years of age without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 
infection who received three doses of BNT162b2 30-µg, for whom neutralizing GMTs prior to vaccination with 
Dose 3 against Delta (36.4) and Omicron (12.7) were increased at 1-month post-Dose 3 with respect to both 
Delta (1153.6) and Omicron (340.0) titers. Increases were also observed for the reference strain from before 
Dose 3 (33.9) to 1-month post-Dose 3 (1067.1). 
Notably, the dosing interval between Dose 2 and Dose 3 in adults was approximately 6 months, as compared 
with the dosing interval between Dose 2 and Dose 3 in the pediatric age group of approximately 2 to 3 
months. The longer interval, as well as potential differences in antibody waning over time, may contribute to 
the higher increase in GMTs observed in adults as compared to the pediatric population.

GMFR – Children 6 Months to <2 Years of Age 
For children 6 months to <2 years of age without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection who received three 
doses of BNT162b2 3-µg, there was an observed 6.4-fold increase in Delta and 7.8-fold increase in Omicron 
neutralizing titers obtained in the FFRNT assay from before Dose 3 to 1-month post-Dose 3 (Table below). 
The GMFR for the reference strain from before Dose 3 to 1-month post-Dose 3 was 6.2.  
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/890761/2022

For adults 18 to 55 years of age without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection who received three doses of 
BNT162b2 30-µg, there was on observed 31.7-fold increase in Delta and 26.7-fold increase in Omicron 
neutralizing titers obtained in the FFRNT assay from before Dose 3 to1-month post-Dose 3. The GMFR for the 
reference strain from before Dose 3 to 1-month post- Dose 3 was 31.5. 
Noting that adults had a longer dosing interval between Dose 2 and Dose 3 (approximately 6 months) at a 
time when antibody levels may be waning and the effects of a booster may be more pronounced, compared 
with children in this age group (approximately 2 to 3 months), a higher GMFR in the adults compared to the 
pediatric population may be expected.

Updated Supportive Analysis 
An additional descriptive immunogenicity analysis was conducted using the FFRNT assay, to compare children 
with adults who received a third dose of BNT162b2 at a similar interval between Dose 2 and Dose 3. This 
analysis compared Phase 2/3 pediatric participants in Study C4591007 with a subset of adults 18 to 50 years 
of age in Phase 3 Study C4591017 (lot consistency study) who had received a two-dose primary series 
followed by a booster (third) dose of BNT162b2 30-µg. The dosing interval between Dose 2 and Dose 3 was a 
median 13.0 weeks (range: 11.9 to 14.3 weeks) for adults and 12.9 weeks (range: 8.6 to 20.0 weeks) for 
children 6 months to <2 years of age). At 1-month post-Dose 3, among 32 children 6 months to <2 years of 
age without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, the neutralizing GMT was 128.8; correspondingly, 
among 27 adults 18 to 50 years of age without evidence of priorSARS-CoV-2 infection, the neutralizing GMT 
at 1-month post-Dose 3 was 164.2. These data show that for populations who received three doses of 
BNT162b2 at the age-appropriate dose level and administered at a comparable dosing interval, the Omicron 
specific neutralization titers are very similar in the pediatric population and an adult comparator group for 
whom high efficacy was observed.

This updated analysis presents observed VE against symptomatic COVID-19 for the three-dose series of 
BNT162b2 3-µg during blinded placebo-controlled follow-up. The analysis is based on 34 cases confirmed at 
least 7 days post-Dose 3 up to the data cutoff date of 17 June 2022, in the combined Dose 3 evaluable 
efficacy population of children 6 months to <5 years of age without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
Analyses include post-Dose 3 VE by SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (which were all identified from 
sequencing data as sub-lineages of Omicron), and analyses excluding cases involving coinfection with other 
respiratory pathogens.

Efficacy Against Symptomatic COVID-19 
This section presents results of analyses across the combined population of children 6 months to <5 years of 
age, conducted according to the protocol prespecified secondary efficacy objectives. 
Dose 3 Evaluable Efficacy Populations – Children 6 Months to <5 Years of Age 
Participants Without Evidence of Prior SARS-CoV-2 Infection 
The first secondary VE hypothesis for 6 months to <5 years was evaluated in participants without evidence of 
prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. The observed VE from at least 7 days after Dose 3 across the total evaluable 
population of children 6 months to <5 years of age without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection before or 
during the vaccination regimen was 73.2% (2-sided 95% CI: 43.8%, 87.6%) based on 13 cases in the 
BNT162b2 group and 21 cases in the placebo group, adjusted for surveillance time (noting 2:1 randomization 
of vaccine: placebo) (Table below ). The predefined success criterion, lower bound of 95% CI for VE >30%, 
was met.

after Dose 3 across the total evaluable population of children 6 months to <5 years of age with or without 
evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection before or during the vaccination regimen was 72.5% (2-sided 95% CI: 
44.3%, 86.9%) based on 14 cases in the BNT162b2 group and 23 cases in the placebo group, adjusted for 
surveillance time (noting 2:1 randomization of vaccine:placebo). The predefined success criterion, lower

Substantial separation of the Kaplan-Meier curves is evident very early starting from at least 7 days after 
Dose 3, with placebo cases steadily accruing and comparative fewer cases occurring more distantly after 
BNT162b2 vaccination (Figure 1). 
In the analysis by SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern in this population (Table below), the observed VE after 
Dose 3 was 72.6% to 82.9% against the most frequently identified variants (Omicron sublineages 
BA.2.12.1 and BA.2). Few cases were identified as BA.4 or BA.5, precluding meaningful interpretation of VE 
for these sublineages whether considered separately or combined.

Vaccine Efficacy from Dose 1 to Cutoff Date- Children 6 Months to <5 Years of Age 
The observed VE for BNT162b2 3-µg against any confirmed COVID-19 from Dose 1 onwards in the 
Dose 1 all-available population for children 6 months to <5 years of age was 27.9% 
(2-sided 95% CI: 13.3%, 40.0%) based on 292 cases in the BNT162b2 group and 199 cases in the 
placebo group, adjusted for surveillance time (noting 2:1 randomization of vaccine: placebo), as of the 
data cutoff date 17 June 2022 (Table below). 
When excluding participants who had evidence of coinfection with other respiratory pathogens the 
observed VE after Dose 1 was 27.0% (2-sided 95% CI: 9.4%, 41.0%) based on 220 cases in the 
BNT162b2 group and 148 cases in the placebo group (which excluded 72 cases in the BNT162b2 group 
and 51 cases in the placebo group that involved coinfections).

Children 2 to <5 years of age: 
Disposition and Datasets Analyzed – Children 2 to <5 Years of Age 
The Dose 1 all-available efficacy population of children 2 to <5 years of age included 2349 participants in the 
BNT162b2 group and 1173 participants in the placebo group (Table below), which reflects the 2:1 
randomization. Populations of participants who received three doses of study intervention were: 
•  Dose 3 all-available efficacy population: 864 BNT162b2 recipients and 405 placebo recipients. 
•  Dose 3 evaluable efficacy population with or without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection: 820 
BNT162b2 recipients and 383 placebo recipients. 
•  Dose 3 evaluable efficacy population without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection: 554 
BNT162b2 recipients and 224 placebo recipients. 
Exclusions from the Dose 3 evaluable efficacy population were primarily due to participants not receiving 
three vaccine doses prior to unblinding (63.2% of BNT162b2 group and 65.5% of placebo group). 
Note that Dose 3 administration began on 31 January 2022 and the study was still actively enrolling at 
that time. Analysis populations included participants who received BNT162b2 3-µg or placebo, and 
therefore excluded participants who turned 5 years of age and received the age appropriate BNT162b2 
10-µg dose level (which per protocol would have occurred after unblinding).

Demographics – Children 2 to <5 Years of Age 
Demographic characteristics for participants 2 to <5 years of age in the Dose 3 evaluable efficacy population 
without  evidence  of  prior  SARS-CoV-2  infection  were  generally  similar  in  BNT162b2  and  placebo  groups 
(Table below). 
Most participants were White (77.6%) and the population included 3.7% Black or African American 
participants, 10.0% Asian participants, 8.0% multiracial participants, with other race subgroups 
comprising <1%. In total, 9.8% of participants were Hispanic/Latino. The population was balanced with 
regard to sex with 45.9% male and 54.1% female participants. Comorbidities present at baseline that 
increase the risk of severe COVID-19 disease (which included obesity in this age group) were reported in 
similar proportions of participants in the BNT162b2 group (11.9%) and placebo group (13.8%). Obesity in 
this age group was reported in 6.0% of participants in the BNT162b2 group and 4.0% in the placebo 
group. 
Among participants in the Dose 3 evaluable efficacy population with or without evidence of prior SARS-
CoV-2 infection, 13.2% in the BNT162b2 group and 17.8% in the placebo group were baseline positive 
for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Other demographic characteristics were generally similar to the

Dose 3 All-Available Efficacy Population – Children 2 to <5 Years of Age 
The observed VE from at least 7 days after Dose 3 among children 2 to <5 years of age in the Dose 3 all-
available population was 70.6% (2-sided 95% CI: 30.1%, 88.2%) based on 10 cases in the BNT162b2 
group and 15 cases in the placebo group, adjusted for surveillance time (noting 2:1 randomization of 
vaccine:placebo). 
In the analysis by SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern in this population, the observed VE after Dose 3 was 
68.5% to 82.4% against the most frequently identified Omicron sublineages (BA.2.12.1 and BA.2). Few 
cases were identified as BA.4 or BA.5, precluding reliable estimation of VE for these sublineages whether 
considered separately or combined. 
Relative Vaccine Efficacy of Three vs Two Doses– Children 2 to <5 Years of Age 
The RVE of BNT162b2 3-µg against symptomatic COVID-19 based on 2 cases reported at least 7 days after 
Dose 3 (original BNT162b2 group) compared with 4 cases reported at least 7 days after Dose 2 (original 
placebo group who were unblinded to receive BNT162b2) during the period of 07 February 2022 to 29 April 
2022 was 84.0% (2-sided 95% CI: -11.8%, 98.6%) 
Vaccine Efficacy from Dose 1 to Cutoff Date – Children 2 to <5 Years of Age Dose 1 All-Available Efficacy 
Population – Children 2 to <5 Years of Age 
The observed VE from Dose 1 onwards in the Dose 1 all-available population of children 2 to <5 years of age 
was 32.3% (2-sided 95% CI: 13.8%, 46.7%) based on 169 cases in the BNT162b2 group and 121 cases in 
the placebo group, adjusted for surveillance time (noting 2:1 randomization of vaccine:placebo) (Table 
below). 
Clear  separation  of  the  Kaplan-Meier  curves  for  BNT162b2  and  placebo  groups  is  evident  by 
approximately 4 months after the first dose which generally coincides with completion of the three-
dose series for this age group. 
When excluding participants who had evidence of coinfection with other respiratory pathogens the 
observed VE after Dose 1 was 33.6% (2-sided 95% CI: 12.2%, 49.7%) based on 126 cases in the 
BNT162b2 group and 92 cases in the placebo group (which excluded 43 cases in the BNT162b2 group 
and 29 cases in the placebo group that involved coinfections).

Signs and Symptoms of COVID-19 – Children 2 to <5 Years of Age 
Confirmed cases occurring after Dose 1 among participants 2 to <5 years of age had signs and 
symptoms (per protocol case criteria) consistent with mostly mild to moderate illness, similar in both 
groups (Table below). The most commonly reported were new or increased cough (63.4%) and fever 
(59.0%) from protocol-defined symptoms and including nasal congestion or runny nose (37.2%) from 
additional CDC-defined symptoms. Most participants in both groups reported ≤3 concurrent signs or 
symptoms. 
The reported signs and symptoms for each age subgroup (ie, 2 years, 3 years, or 4 years of age) were 
generally similar.

Participants with Multiple Episodes of COVID-19 During the Study – Children 2 to <5 Years of Age 
As of the data cutoff date (17 June 2022), several participants in the 2 to <5 years of age group had 
virologically and clinically confirmed multiple episodes of COVID-19. Narratives for these participants are in 
Module 5.3.5.1. 
• 
• 
In the BNT162b2 group, 6 participants had multiple episodes of COVID-19; all of these cases occurred 
post-Dose 2 (and prior to Dose 3). Two participants had initial illness in Q3 2021 followed by subsequent 
illness in early 2022; all other cases occurred from early 2022 onwards (ie, after an Omicron surge had 
begun). 
In the placebo group, 2 participants had multiple episodes of COVID-19; one participant had both initial 
and subsequent illnesses post-Dose 2 (and prior to Dose 3), and the other participant had both initial and 
subsequent illnesses post-Dose 3. All cases occurred from early 2022 onwards. 
Note, several participants had multiple PCR-positive results confirming COVID-19, for which the last reported 
symptom of the initial case confirmation was followed within a brief period (eg, a month or less) by a 
subsequent PCR-positive result and new report of associated symptoms. 
Such instances are unlikely to represent separate illnesses. For participants meeting these criteria, all of the 
reported symptoms and PCR results were in early 2022 or later. 
The reported signs and symptoms associated with the initial and the subsequent episodes generally reflected 
mild to moderate illness for the BNT162b2 and placebo cases, with none of the cases meeting any criteria for

severe illness. None of the participants with multiple episodes had serological and/or virological evidence of 
prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 at baseline. 
Severe COVID-19 and MIS-C – Children 2 to <5 Years of Age 
As of the data cutoff date (17 June 2022), 9 participants in the 2 to <5 years of age group had confirmed 
COVID-19 which met one or more of the severe case criteria, including 6 in the BNT162b2 group and 3 in 
the placebo group (taking into account 2:1 randomization). 
As of the data cutoff date, no cases of MIS-C were reported in this age group. 
Note, for all of the participants who met a single protocol defined criterion for severe illness, the symptoms 
were considered by the investigator as not clinically significant based on examination at the illness visit, 
vital signs being near normal limits, and contributing circumstances such as the child crying during 
examination. Note that protocol criteria were adapted from the FDA definition and designed to 
conservatively identify possible severe illness. 
In the BNT162b2 group there were 6 cases that fulfilled severe criteria as summarized below.

examination at the illness visit, vital signs near normal limits, and other contributing circumstances such 
as the child crying during examination.

Children 6 months to <2 years of age: 
Disposition and Datasets Analyzed – 6 Months to <2 Years of Age 
The Dose 1 all-available efficacy population of children 6 months to <2 years of age included 1444 
participants in the BNT162b2 group and 718 participants in the placebo group (Table below), which 
reflects the 2:1 randomization. Populations of participants who received three doses of study 
intervention were 
•  Dose 3 all-available efficacy population: 487 BNT162b2 recipients and 237 placebo recipients 
•  Dose 3 evaluable efficacy population with or without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection: 474 
BNT162b2 recipients and 229 placebo recipients. 
•  Dose 3 evaluable efficacy population without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection: 319 
BNT162b2 recipients and 157 placebo recipients. 
Exclusions from the Dose 3 evaluable efficacy population were primarily due to participants not receiving 
three vaccine doses prior to unblinding (66.3% of BNT162b2 group and 67.0% of placebo group). 
Note that Dose 3 administration began on 31 January 2022 and the study was still actively enrolling at that 
time.

Demographics – 6 Months to <2 Years of Age 
Demographic characteristics for participants 6 months to <2 years of age in the Dose 3 evaluable efficacy 
population without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection were generally similar in BNT162b2 and 
placebo groups (Table below). 
Most participants were White (75.2%) and the population included 2.7% Black or African American 
participants, 9.9% Asian participants, 11.8% multiracial participants, with other race subgroups 
comprising <1%. In total, 10.3% of participants were Hispanic/Latino. The population was balanced with 
regard to sex with 51.1% male and 48.9% female participants. Comorbidities present at baseline that 
increase the risk of severe COVID-19 disease were reported in similar proportions of participants in the 
BNT162b2 group (3.1%) and placebo group (3.8%). 
Among participants in the Dose 3 evaluable efficacy population with or without evidence of prior SARS-
CoV-2 infection, 8.4% in the BNT162b2 group and 7.0% in the placebo group were baseline positive for 
prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Other demographic characteristics were generally similar to the population 
without evidence of prior infection. The demographics of the Dose 1 all-available and Dose 3 all-
available efficacy populations were also overall similar.

Vaccine Efficacy from at Least 7 Days After Dose 3 to Cutoff Date – 6 Months to <2 Years of Age 
Dose 3 All-Available Efficacy Population – Children 6 Months to <2 Years of Age 
The observed VE from at least 7 days after Dose 3 among children 6 months to <2 years of age in the 
evaluable population without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection before or during the vaccination regimen 
was 75.8% (2-sided 95% CI: 9.7%, 94.7%) based on 4 cases in the BNT162b2 group and 8 cases in the 
placebo group, adjusted for surveillance time (noting 2:1 randomization of vaccine:placebo). The observed 
VE in the evaluable population with or without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection before or during the 
vaccination regimen was 76.2% (2-sided 95% CI: 11.1%, 94.8%) based on 4 cases in the BNT162b2 group 
and 8 cases in the placebo group, 
In the analysis by SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern in this population, the observed VE after Dose 3 was 83.9% 
against both of the most frequently identified Omicron sublineages (BA.2.12.1 and BA.2). Few cases were 
identified as BA.4 or BA.5, precluding reliable estimation of VE for these sublineages whether considered 
separately or combined. 
When excluding participants who had evidence of coinfection with other respiratory pathogens the observed 
VE after Dose 3 was 79.3% (2-sided 95% CI: 9.2%, 96.5%) based on 3 cases in the BNT162b2 group and 7 
cases in the placebo group (which excluded 1 case in the BNT162b2 group and 1 case in the placebo group 
that involved coinfections). 
Relative Vaccine Efficacy of Three vs Two Doses – Children 6 Months to <2 Years of Age 
The RVE of BNT162b2 3-µg against symptomatic COVID-19 based on 2 cases reported at least 7 days after 
Dose 3 (original BNT162b2 group) compared with 2 cases reported at least 7 days after Dose 2 (original 
placebo group who were unblinded to receive BNT162b2) during the period of 07 February 2022 to 29 April 
2022 was 59.4% (2-sided 95% CI: -459.5%, 97.1%). 
Vaccine Efficacy from Dose 1 to Cutoff Date – Children 6 Months to <2 Years of Age 
Dose 1 All-Available Efficacy Population – Children 6 Months to <2 Years of Age 
The observed VE from Dose 1 onwards in the Dose 1 all-available population of children 6 months to <2 years 
of age was 20.9% (2-sided 95% CI: -6.4%, 40.9%) based on 123 cases in the BNT162b2 group and 78 cases 
in the placebo group, adjusted for surveillance time (noting the 2:1 randomization of vaccine:placebo) (Table 
below). 
Clear  separation  of  the  Kaplan-Meier  curves  for  BNT162b2  and  placebo  groups  is  evident  by 
approximately 5 months after the first dose which generally coincides with completion of the three-
dose series for this age group. 
When excluding participants who had evidence of coinfection with other respiratory pathogens the 
observed VE after Dose 1 was 15.8% (2-sided 95% CI: -19.4%, 40.2%) based on 94 cases in the

Signs and Symptoms of COVID-19 – Children 6 Months to <2 Years of Age 
Confirmed cases occurring after Dose 1 among participants 6 months to <2 years of age had signs and 
symptoms consistent with mostly mild to moderate illness, similar in both groups (Table below). The most 
commonly reported were new or increased cough (69.7%) and fever (65.2%) from protocol-defined 
symptoms and including nasal congestion or runny nose (46.3%) from additional CDC-defined symptoms. 
Most participants in either group reported ≤3 concurrent signs or symptoms. 
The reported signs and symptoms for each age subgroup (i.e., 6 to <12 months, 12 to <18 months, or 18 to 
<24 months of age) were generally similar.

Participants with Multiple Episodes of COVID-19 During the Study – Children 6 Months to <2 Years of Age 
As of the data cutoff date (17 June 2022), several participants in the 6 months to <2 years of age group had 
virologically and clinically confirmed multiple episodes of COVID-19. Narratives for these participants are 
available in Module 5.3.2.1. 
• 
In the BNT162b2 group, 3 participants had multiple episodes of COVID-19; these cases occurred 
post-Dose 2 (and prior to Dose 3), with exception of one participant who had initial illness 180 
days post-Dose 2  and subsequent illness 23 days post-Dose 3. Two participants had initial illness 
in Q4 2021 followed by subsequent illness in Q1 2022; the third participants had initial illness in 
Q1 2022 and subsequent illness after two months. All cases occurred during a period in which an 
Omicron surge had begun. 
• 
In the placebo group, 3 participants had multiple episodes of COVID-19; one participant had both 
initial and several subsequent illnesses 3 days, 11 days, and 36 days post-Dose 1; one

participant had both initial and subsequent illnesses 21 days and 51 days post-Dose 2 (both prior 
to Dose 3); and the remaining participant had initial illness 18 day post-crossover Dose 1 of 
BNT162b2 3-µg  and subsequent illness 7 days post-crossover Dose 2 of BNT162b2 3-µg. 
Note, several participants had multiple PCR-positive results confirming COVID-19, for which the last reported 
symptom of the initial case confirmation was followed within a brief period (eg, a month or less) by a 
subsequent PCR-positive result and new report of associated symptoms. Such instances are unlikely to 
represent separate illnesses. 
The reported signs and symptoms associated with the initial and the subsequent episodes generally reflected 
mild to moderate illness for the BNT162b2 and placebo cases, with none of the cases meeting any criteria for 
severe illness. None of the participants with multiple episodes had serological and/or virological evidence at 
baseline of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2. 
Severe COVID-19 and MIS-C – Children 6 Months to <2 Years of Age 
As of the data cutoff date (17 June 2022), 3 participants in the 6 months to <2 years of age group had 
COVID-19. Criteria for severe illness were fulfilled for 2 cases (both occurring post-Dose 2) in the 
BNT162b2 group and 1 case (occurring post-Dose 3) in the placebo group (taking into account 2:1 
randomization), among them one case in the BNT162b2 group reported after the participant was 
unblinded which could have introduced potential bias (Table below). No participants with cases meeting 
severe criteria had evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2. 
One case in the BNT162b2 group (identified as Omicron sublineage BA.2.12.1 infection) fulfilled multiple 
severe illness criteria including CDC criteria of hospitalization and admission to the ICU, and notably 
involved parainfluenza coinfection and clinical assessment including wheezing, cough, fatigue, and fever. 
The remaining two cases (1 each in the BNT162b3 and placebo groups) fulfilled a single criterion of 
increased heart rate and were reported post-Dose 2. For these participants who met a single protocol-
defined criterion for severe illness, symptoms were considered by the investigator as not clinically 
significant based on examination at the illness visit, vital signs near normal limits, and other contributing 
circumstances such as the child crying during examination. 
Table 38.  Characterization of COVID-19 cases assigned as severe per FDA criteria among children 6m to 
<2yo 
As of the data cutoff date, no cases of MIS-C were reported in this age group.

Notes 
7 participants in the 2 to <5 years of age group had confirmed severe 
COVID-19, including 6 in the BNT162b2 group and 1 in the placebo group. 
1 participant in the 6 months to <2 years of age group, a placebo 
recipient, had confirmed severe COVID-19. 
No cases of MIS-C were reported. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Based upon review of safety and immunogenicity results from the Phase 1 portion of the study, the 
BNT162b2 dose level selected for further evaluation in Phase 2/3 was 3 µg for the 6 months -<5 years age 
group. The selected dose is agreed based on the antibody response and safety results.  
In Phase 2/3, the efficacy of BNT162b2 was established by immunobridging of the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing 
antibody response in paediatric participants aged 6m to <2 years old and 2 to <5 years of age group in 
Study C4591007 to the response in young adult participants 16 to 25 years of age in Phase 2/3 efficacy study 
C4591001. This is the same approach which was used for the extension of the indication to for 12-15 year 
olds (EMA/H/C/005735/II/0030) and for 5 to <12 years old (EMA/H/C/005735/X/077). The reason to divide 
6m-<5 year old group into younger (6m-<2 year) and older (2-<5 year old) age groups based on 
assumption that immunogenicity and safety of 3 µg BNT162b2 may differ even in rather narrow age range 
due to the developmental status of the young children. 
Preliminary, immunogenicity of 2 doses of 3 µg BNT162b2 in 6m to <2 years old and 2 to <5 years of age 
group was compared to 2 doses of 30 µg BNT162b2 in 16 to 25 years old. The immunobridging exercise 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/890761/2022 
Page 72/155 
 
 
 
 
 
 
failed for 2 to < 5 years old groups as the GMR was lower than in young adults. Therefore, MAH after 
consulting with EMA continued the study with comparison of 3 doses of 3 µg BNT162b2 in 6m to <2 years old 
and 2 to <5 years of age group as primary series compared to 2 doses of 30 µg BNT162b2 in 16 to 25 years 
old. 
The design of the immunobridging exercise is endorsed and the use of the historical controls (16-25 yo) from 
study C4591001 are acceptable as these serology samples were analysed side by side with samples from 6m 
to <2 and 2 to <5 years old. The time shift between receipt of vaccine for study arms is expected to have no 
impact for immunogenicity. 
The Phase 2/3 evaluable immunogenicity population for participants 6m to <2 years of age included 82 
participants in the BNT162b2 group and 49 participants in the placebo group, and for 2-<5 years old group 
included 143 participants in the BNT162b2 group and 59 participants in the placebo group. Study C4591001 
participants 16 to 25 years of age included 170 participants in the BNT162b2 group and 38 participants in the 
placebo group.  
According to the study protocol, approximately 250 participants (200 in the active vaccine group and 50 in 
the placebo group) were planned to be randomized in each younger age group (≥6 months to <2 years and 
≥2 to <5 years of age). These numbers in the sample size calculation are inconsistent with the actual 
number of patients in the analysis. It instead seems that this part of the study was powered for 
immunogenicity comparison between entire age group of children from 6m to <5 year as altogether there 
was 225 subjects in entire active arm. The sample size (N=82) in active arm among younger age group is 
considerably smaller than in older group (N=143), but large enough for immunogenicity evaluation. The 
immunogenicity analyses for entire active arm of 6m-<5 year old (N= 225) vs. control arm of 16-25 yo 
(N=170) was not presented, but were requested at the primary round. Updated data were submitted by 
MAH. 
The MAH also submitted supportive immunogenicity data for SARS-CoV-2 serum neutralizing titers against 
USA-WA1/2020 (reference), B.1.617.2 (Delta) and Omicron BA.1 variant strains. Cohorts were limited in 
size: 40 participants (34 in active and 4 in placebo arm) in 2 to <5 year old and 37 (32 in active and 5 in 
placebo arm) in 6m-<2 year old and 40 (only active arm) in 16-26 year old age groups. The sample size in 
this supportive analysis was small and the neutralization assay not yet validated, therefore these data are 
considered supportive, but important in light of the Delta and Omicron BA1 variant epidemiology. Also, 
additional descriptive immunogenicity analysis of neutralizing titers was conducted, to compare children with 
adults who received a third dose of BNT162b2 at a similar interval between Dose 2 and Dose 3. 
A supportive vaccine efficacy analysis was planned to be evaluated for the combination of ≥6 months to <2 
years and ≥2 to <5 years of age if immunobridging is successful, depending on accrual of a sufficient number 
of cases in those age groups. According to SAP, sufficient number was 21 cases from 7 days after Dose 3. In 
reality, for the analysis at the cut-off 29.04.2022, there were only 10 cases in study population. The 
statistical methods for calculating Vaccine Efficacy are considered appropriate. The efficacy analysis was 
based on confirmed cases among the initially enrolled N~1500 participants in the 6 months to <5 year years 
of age group of Study C4591007.  The MAH submitted updated VE data from cut-off 17.06.2022. The MAH 
stated that this efficacy analysis was conducted in accordance with the C4591007 protocol-specified and 
hypothesis-testing secondary efficacy objective, which was to evaluate vaccine efficacy (VE) when at least 21 
confirmed COVID-19 cases had accrued among the combined population of children 2 to <5 years and 6 
months to <2 years of age following completion of the three-dose vaccination series. The Committee did not 
agree totally here with the MAH and was asked to discuss the statistical analysis plan as well as the study 
conduct, including the peek before the accrual of 21 cases, and justify that the VE data presently proposed 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/890761/2022 
Page 73/155 
 
 
for the SmPC are type 1 error controlled. The company clarified that the first submitted analysis was 
descriptive and that the descriptive nature of this analysis was documented in the SAP. As a consequence, 
this analysis does not affect the type I error control of the hypothesis testing of the second VE analysis. The 
second VE analysis is therefore considered to have type I error control. 
Among randomized participants, 992 participants were included in the BNT162b2 group and 464 participants 
in the placebo group. This part of the study was designed and powered for vaccine efficacy evaluation 
between active and placebo arm. The design and study protocol for the vaccine efficacy part is endorsed. The 
analysis appears to have been performed before the pre-defined number of cases had been accrued, but at 
the same cut-off date 19.04.2022 as primary immunogenicity analysis was done. As the presented data were 
preliminary, the final report with final analysis is requested and will be submitted when available. 
The blinding procedure appears appropriate. However, due to reactogenicity it seems likely that some of the 
study subjects and/or their guardians, may have guessed their treatment allocation. This is however unlikely 
to impact immunogenicity or efficacy conclusions.  
Assessment of paediatric data on immunogenicity and clinical efficacy  
Among participants in the evaluable immunogenicity population without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 
infection, the GMR of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers in children 2 to <5 years of age (at 1-month post-
Dose 3 of BNT162b2 3-µg) compared to young adults 16 to 25 years of age (at 1-month post-Dose 2 of 
BNT162b2 30-µg) was 1.30 (2-sided 95% CI: 1.13, 1.50). GMR in children 6 months to <2 years of age 
compared to young adults was 1.19 (2-sided 95% CI: 1.00, 1.42). The post-hoc immunogenicity analysis for 
entire age group showed very similar result, as expected. GMR in children 6 months to <5 years of age 
compared to young adults was 1.26 (2-sided 95% CI: 1.11, 1.43). 
As the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for GMR was >0.67 and the GMR point estimate was >0.8 
(protocol specified criterion) and >1.0 (requested by FDA), indicating the prespecified immunobridging 
success criterion for the GMR was met for both age groups 6 months to <2 years and 2 to <5 years old. Both 
of the age groups fulfilled the immunobridging criterion despite of the lower sample size than initially 
planned. No immunobridging results were presented for entire 6 months to <5-year-old cohort compared to 
the young adults. The Committee thought that this data would be suitable to be presented in SmPC instead 
of separate chapter for younger and older age group as it saves space and would be easier for the prescriber 
to gasp. Therefore, it was requested. The MAH clarified that the protocol-specified hypothesis for 
immunobridging was separate for the age groups 6 months to <2 years and 2 to <5 years. The results were 
therefore presented separately in the CSR and resulting manuscripts.  
Almost equal proportions (100 % each of children 2- <5 years of age and 6m-<2 yo and 99% young adults 
16 to 25 years of age) of participants achieved a seroresponse. The difference in the proportions of 
participants who had seroresponse between the 2 age groups (children – young adults) was 1.2% (2-sided 
95% CI: -1.5%, 4.2% for 2- <5 yo and -3.4%, 4.2% for 6m-<2 yo). The lower limit of the 95% CI for the 
difference in seroresponse rate were -1.5% and -3.4%, which is greater than the prespecified margin of -
10%. Therefore, immunobridging based on seroresponse rate was achieved. The post-hoc analysis showed 
the difference of the seroresponse rate in children 6 months to <5 years of age compared to young adults 
was 1.2% (2-sided 95% CI: -0.5%, 4.2%). 
As immunobridging was successful, the MAH continued with VE analysis. Among participants without prior 
evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection before or during the vaccination regimen, the observed VE for BNT162b2 3 
µg against any confirmed COVID-19 from at least 7 days after Dose 3 was 80.3% (2-sided 95% CI: 13.9%, 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/890761/2022 
Page 74/155 
 
 
96.7%) which included 3 cases in the BNT162b2 group and 7 cases in the placebo group. All these post-Dose 
3 cases were reported in February through April 2022, when Omicron BA1. was most prevalent circulating 
strain in USA.   
Relative Vaccine Efficacy (RVE) of three vs two doses of BNT162b2 3-µg against symptomatic COVID-19 
based on 4 cases reported at least 7 days after Dose 3 (original BNT162b2 group who received three doses) 
compared with 6 cases reported at least 7 days after Dose 2 (original placebo group who were unblinded and 
received two doses of BNT162b2) during the period of 07 February 2022 to 29 April 2022 was 76.2% (2-
sided 95% CI: -0.5%, 95.1%). It indicates that third dose may have a positive impact compared to only two 
doses. 
As a response to the preliminary list of questions, the MAH submitted an updated VE analysis with cut-off 
date 17.06.2022. The median follow-up time for entire cohort, from 6 months to <5 year old children was 2.2 
months. Among participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection before or during the vaccination 
regimen, the observed VE for BNT162b2 3 µg against any confirmed COVID-19  from at least 7 days after 
Dose 3 was 73.2% (2-sided 95% CI: 43.8%, 87.6%) which included 13 cases in the BNT162b2 group 
(N=873) and 21 cases in the placebo group (N=381). Similar VE was shown for both younger (6m-<2y) and 
older (2y-<5y) age groups and also for population with and without previous COVID-19 and for all- available 
efficacy population. All cases, expect one which was undefined, were caused by Omicron strain. The most 
common were Omicron BA.2 and Omicron BA.2.12.1. 
For COVID-19 cases confirmed from Dose 1 onwards in the Dose 1 all-available (mITT) population, the 
observed VE for BNT162b2 3 µg for 2 to < 5 year-old was 32.6% (2-sided 95% CI: 10.8, 48.8%) based on 
127 cases in the BNT162b2 group (N=1835) and 92 cases in the placebo group (N= 915).  In 6 months to 
<2-year age group, VE from Dose 1 onwards was 14.0 % (2-sided 95% CI: -21.2, 38.4%) based on 98 cases 
in the BNT162b2 group (N=1178) and 58 cases in the placebo group (N= 598). As stated above, these 
analyses for entire 6 months to <5 years population was not presented at the submission, and it was 
requested. The updated analysis with cut-off 17.06.2022 showed VE for BNT162b2 3-µg against any 
confirmed COVID-19 from Dose 1 onwards in the Dose 1 all-available population for children 6 months to <5 
years of age was 27.9% (2-sided 95% CI: 13.3%, 40.0%) based on 292 cases in the BNT162b2 group and 
199 cases in the placebo group, adjusted for surveillance time. Very similar VE was observed also, when the 
children with respiratory coinfections were excluded from the analysis.  
There were 8 severe cases of COVID-19 in age group 6m-<5-year-old in active arm after 2-doses, whereas in 
placebo arm 4 severe case appeared (according to FDA definition). Notably, none of the cases showed clinical 
signs that would suggest VAERD. 
No MIS-C were reported in the 6 months to <5 years of age group, per protocol definition or per CDC 
definition. 
Overall, BNT162b2 administered as a primary series of three doses of 3 µg given 3 weeks apart of first and 
second dose and at least 8 weeks apart of second and third dose for children 6 months to <5 years of age is 
protective against symptomatic COVID-19. The efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 was demonstrated in 
the age group 6 months to <5 years.  The effect size was smaller to that seen in adults preliminary due to 
the changed epidemiological situation (Omicron BA1. Strain prevalence). As the study is still ongoing the MAH 
is requested to submit the final results of the study when available. Since the submission of this application 
to extend the indication for Comirnaty to children 6 months to <5 years of age, updated efficacy analyses 
became available. Efficacy data presented in the SmPC were updated accordingly. In addition, according to 
the study protocol, updated efficacy analysis at the end of the blinded follow-up period is planned. The MAH 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/890761/2022

should provide complete safety and persistence-of-immunogenicity analysis after complete data are available 
in each age group or at the end of the study. Interim analysis, 6 months post dose 3 immunogenicity and 
safety data will be presented. The final report for the supportive vaccine efficacy analysis should be also 
submitted by the MAH when ready. The study duration for each individual is expected to be approximately 21 
months. 
Specific risk groups among children, including those immunosuppressed, or otherwise with risk of more 
severe disease, were not specifically studied.  A study in immunocompromised children is included in the PIP.  
The duration of protection conveyed by the vaccine is unknown.  
The study was conducted under Omicron wave. Majority of the confirmed cases were BA2. And BA 2.12.1. 
The VE against other Sars-Cov-2 virus variants is unknown. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The immunobridging results demonstrate that 3 doses of 3 µg BNT162b2 given to children 6 months to -< 2 
yo and 2-<5 years of age resulted in very similar neutralising antibody responses (GMTs, GMR, GMFR and 
seroresponses) compared to the efficacy population; that is, 16-25 year old subjects receiving 2 doses of 30 
µg BNT162b2. Thus, efficacy may be inferred based on immunobridging. This is supported by a descriptive 
clinical efficacy data.  
The CHMP considers the following measure necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
New REC: According to the study protocol of study C4591007, updated efficacy analysis at the end of the 
blinded follow-up period is planned. The MAH should provide complete safety and persistence-of-
immunogenicity analysis after complete data are available in each age group or at the end of the study. 
Interim analysis, 6 months post dose 3 immunogenicity and safety data will be presented. The final report for 
the supportive vaccine efficacy analysis should be also submitted by the MAH when ready. 
2.5.5.  Clinical safety 
Study C4591007 is an ongoing, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 1/2/3 pediatric study in healthy 
children and young adults aged 6 months to <12 years. For these pediatric groups, the study was designed 
to evaluate BNT162b2 vaccination in an age de-escalation Phase 1 dose finding part and Phase 2/3 selected 
dose part, in protocol defined age groups: 5 to <12 years, 2 to <5 years, and 6 months to <2 years of age. 
Initiation of the study with the oldest pediatric group (5 to <12 years of age) was based on acceptable safety 
and tolerability demonstrated in adolescents in Study C4591001. The series of BNT162b2 was initially 
planned as a two-dose series; however, based on emerging clinical and real-world data, the protocol was 
amended to add a third dose at the selected dose level for each age group. 
This report summarizes interim data for participants in the 2 to <5 years and 6 months to <2 years of age 
groups comprised of Phase 1 dose-finding safety and immunogenicity analysis results, and Phase 2/3 
selected-dose results including the primary safety objective and select secondary and exploratory 
immunogenicity and efficacy objectives. 
Safety analyses were conducted on the safety population. Phase 1 data are based on analyses up to 1 month 
after Dose 2. Phase 2/3 data are based on analyses up to 1 month after Dose 3 and up to the data cutoff 
date of 29 April 2022. Reactogenicity and antipyretic/pain medication use were recorded daily for 7 days after 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation

each dose administration using prompts from an electronic diary (e-diary). This allowed recording only within 
a fixed time window to provide an accurate representation of the participant’s experience. Grading scales 
were based on FDA guidance.18 Events included:  
Children 2 to <5 years of age: 
• 
Local reactions: pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site 
•  Systemic events: fever, fatigue, headache, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, new or worsened  
muscle pain, and new or worsened joint pain 
Children 6 months to <2 years of age: 
• 
Local reactions: tenderness, redness, and swelling at the injection site 
•  Systemic events: fever, decreased appetite, drowsiness, and irritability 
Unsolicited adverse events (AEs) were collected from Dose 1 through 1 month after Dose 2 and from Dose 3 
through 1 month after Dose 3, and serious AEs (SAEs) were collected from Dose 1 through 6 months after 
Dose 3. Deaths are recorded to the end of study. 
AEs were categorized by frequency, maximum severity, seriousness, and relationship to study intervention 
(per investigator assessment) using system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) according to MedDRA. 
AEs were also categorized as Tier 1 (prespecified events of clinical importance; none designated at this time) 
and Tier 2 (‘common’ PTs, reported in ≥1% of participants in any vaccine group). 
Myocarditis and pericarditis are designated in the C4591007 protocol as AEs of special interest (AESIs). For 
other events of specific clinical interest, the MAH evaluates a dynamic list of MedDRA AE terms during clinical 
safety data review and signal detection; these include events of interest due to association with COVID-19 
and vaccines in general, taking into consideration the CDC list of AESIs for COVID-19 that include events 
potentially indicative of severe COVID-19 or autoimmune and neuroinflammatory disorders. Evidence of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline was determined by serological testing (N-binding assay) and virological 
testing (NAAT) on anterior nares swab at Dose 1 visit (baseline) and medical history of COVID-19. 
Safety narratives were prepared for participants in cases of death, vaccine-related SAEs, safety-related 
withdrawals, and AEs of clinical interest including those requested by FDA. 
Safety data were reported as descriptive summary statistics including counts and percentages of participants 
with the indicated endpoint and the associated Clopper-Pearson 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 
Incidence rates per 1000 person-years are provided for safety data up to the data cutoff date to adjust for 
surveillance time. Missing reactogenicity e-diary data were not imputed.

2.5.5.1.  Patient exposure 
Phase 1 
Disposition 
A total of 49 participants in the 2 to <5 years of age group were assigned into dose level groups (in a 1:1 
ratio) to receive 3-μg or 10-μg BNT162b2. Of these, 48/49 were vaccinated and received both doses of 
BNT162b2 (N=32 in 10-μg group and N=16 in 3-μg group) and were in the safety population. For 
participants 2 to <5 years of age, almost all were administered study intervention as assigned. Overall, 48 
(98.0%) of participants received Dose 1 and Dose 2. Most participants received Dose 2 between 19 to 23 
days after Dose 1 in the 3-μg and 10-μg dose level groups (93.8% and 97.0%, respectively). 
A total of 16 participants in the 6 months to <2 years of age group were assigned to receive 3 µg 
BNT162b2. Of these, 16/16 were vaccinated and received both doses of BNT162b2 and were in the safety 
population. For participants 6 months to <2 years of age, all were administered study intervention as 
assigned. Overall, 16 (100.0%) of participants received Dose 1 and Dose 2. All participants received Dose 2 
between 19 to 23 days after Dose 1 (100.0%). 
No important protocol deviations occurred, and no participants were withdrawn from the Phase 1 part of the 
study.  
Demographics 
Most participants 2 to <5 years of age were White (79.2%), the median age was 3.0 years and 58.3% of 
participants were male. Most 6 months to <2 years of age were White (87.5%), the median age was 15.5 
months and 62.5% of participants were male. 
Participants in the safety population had a medical history profile consistent with that of individuals in the 
general population in the same age group. There were no participants with a history of any cardiac disorder. 
No participants received concomitant vaccines after Dose 1. 
Phase 2/3 –2 to <5 years of age 
Disposition of participants 
Most participants 2 to <5 years of age randomized to either group (>99%) received two doses, and 32.2% 
received the third dose of study intervention prior to unblinding, as of the data cutoff date (29 April 2022). 
The safety population constitutes of 2750 phase 2/3 participants e BNT162b2 (N=1835) and placebo 
(N=915) groups. No participants in the safety population were excluded from the study. No participants 
included in the safety population were HIV+. 
Few participants, who were all in the placebo group, discontinued from the vaccination period due to AEs. 
Few participants were withdrawn from the study (1.6%). The most common reason was due to withdrawal by 
parent/guardian. 
Among participants originally randomized to the BNT162b2 group, unblinding (per protocol, at 6-months 
post-Dose 2 or when turning 5 years of age) occurred for 1 child (0.1%) who received open-label Dose 2 and 
for 435 children (51.7%) who received open-label Dose 3. 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/890761/2022 
Page 78/155 
 
 
Among participants originally randomized to the placebo group, unblinding during the vaccination period 
occurred for 370 children (87.3%) who received the first, 350 children (82.5%) who received the second 
dose, and for 98 children (23.1%) who received a third dose of open-label BNT162b2. 
Few participants (5.0%) from the original placebo group reached the 1-month post-Dose 3 visit after 
unblinding and initiating the series of BNT162b2. For this age group, BNT162b2 administered after unblinding 
was at the age-appropriate dose level at the time of vaccination (3-μg if <5 years of age, 10-μg if 5 years of 
age); see below regarding children who turned 5 years and received the higher dose. Data from participants 
who were unblinded are included in safety endpoint analyses up to the point at which they were unblinded. 
Safety endpoint analyses are focused on blinded placebo-controlled follow-up. Separate analyses that include 
safety data obtained after participant unblinding are additionally provided for reactogenicity and AEs.

Important protocol deviations 
Important protocol deviations were reported for 41 participants (2.2%) in the BNT162b2 group and 16 
participants (1.7%) in the placebo group. Most protocol deviations in the BNT162b2 group were related to 
investigational product (23 [1.3%] compared with 9 [1.0%] in the placebo group), which included dosing 
errors, vaccination delay criteria related to non-study vaccine administration, or being deemed unsuitable for 
use (as BNT162b2 must be thawed/diluted prior to administration, whereas saline placebo does not). 
Duration of follow-up 
The median duration of blinded follow-up for after Dose 3 was 1.4 months (range: 0.0 to 3.2 months) (Table 
below).

Vaccine administration and timing 
Data on vaccine administration and timing in phase 2/3, children 2 to <5 Years of Age as of the data cutoff 
date (29 April 2022) are presented in the table below. 
All participants in the original placebo group received Dose 1 of placebo as randomized, and 99.1% and 
30.6% received Dose 2 and Dose 3, respectively, during blinded follow-up. After unblinding (per protocol) to 
receive active vaccination with BNT162b2, 305 children (33.3%) received a first active dose of BNT162b2 at 
the 3-μg dose level and 65 (7.1%) received the 10-μg dose level.

Demographic and other baseline characteristics 
Demographic characteristics for phase 2/3 pediatric participants 2 to <5 years of age were similar in 
BNT162b2 and placebo groups in the safety population (Table below). 
Comorbidities present at baseline that increase the risk of severe COVID-19 disease19 (excluding obesity) 
were present in similar proportions of participants in the BNT162b2 group (6.4%) and placebo group (9.7%). 
The most common baseline comorbidities (BNT162b2 vs placebo) were: 
•  Asthma (2.8% vs 4.7%) 
•  Disabilities (0.9% vs 1.4%) 
• 
Premature birth (1.1% vs 1.0%) 
One participant who was in the BNT162b2 group had an immunocompromised condition reported at baseline 
(neutropenia). Demographics of participants in the original placebo group who were unblinded to receive 
active vaccination with BNT162b2 were generally similar to those of the blinded vaccine groups.

Medical History 
The safety population included children with medical histories consistent with the general population. The 
SOCs with the most reported medical history PTs, and other select SOCs, were: 
Immune system disorders: 13.6% in BNT162b2 and 16.5% in placebo mostly consisting of a variety of non-
drug allergies, also including drug hypersensitivity (1.7% in BNT162b2 and 2.8% in placebo) and 
anaphylactic reaction (0.1% in BNT162b2 and 0.2% in placebo). 
Infections and infestations: 10.6% in BNT162b2 and 12.0% in placebo including a variety of viral and 
bacterial infections commonly seen in this age group. History of COVID-19 was reported in 0.9% of 
participants each in BNT162b2 and placebo groups (17 vs 8). 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: 9.0% in BNT162b2 and 10.1% in placebo mostly consisting of 
eczema (5.1% in BNT162b2 and 5.9% in placebo) and various types of rashes and dermatitis that may be 
commonly seen in this age group. 
Nervous system disorders: 2.8% in BNT162b2 and 2.2% in placebo including various types of epilepsy and 
sensory or developmental disorders that may be commonly seen in this age group. 
Psychiatric disorders: 1.4% in BNT162b2 and 1.2% in placebo including autism spectrum disorder (0.5% in 
BNT162b2 and 0.7% in placebo), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (0.2% in BNT162b2), and a variety 
of behavioural disorders that may be commonly seen in this age group. 
Cardiac disorders: reported in 6 (0.3%) participants in the BNT162b2 and 4 (0.4%) participants in the 
placebo group including bradycardia, tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia (n=1 each in the BNT162b2 
group) and pulmonary valve stenosis (n=2 in the BNT162b2 group and n=1 each in the placebo group). 
Additionally, congenital cardiac conditions (e.g., atrial or ventricular septal defects, pulmonary valve disorder, 
patent ductus arteriosus, cardiomyopathy, Prader-Willi syndrome) were reported in both the BNT162b2 and 
placebo groups at low frequencies (<1%). 
Concomitant vaccines were administered in 13.1% in BNT162b2 and 11.6% in placebo group. 
Phase 2/3 – 6 months to <2 years of age 
Disposition  
Disposition of children 6 months to <2 years of age until cutoff date (29APR2022) is presented in the table 
below. The safety population of 1776 Phase 2/3 participants 6 months to <2 years of age was: BNT162b2 
(N=1178) and placebo (N=598) groups. No participants in the safety population were excluded from the 
study. No participants included in the safety population were HIV+.

Important protocol deviations 
Important protocol deviations were reported in 22 participants in the BNT162b2 group and 8 participants in 
the placebo group. Most protocol deviations in the BNT162b2 group were related to investigational product 
(17 compared with 4 in the placebo group), such as dosing errors, vaccination delay criteria related to non-
study vaccine administration, or being deemed unsuitable for use. 
Duration of follow-up

Demographic and other baseline characteristics 
Demographic characteristics for phase 2/3 pediatric participants 6 months to <2 years of age were similar in 
BNT162b2 and placebo groups in the safety population (Table below). 
Comorbidities present at baseline that increase the risk of severe COVID-19 disease19 were present in similar 
proportions of participants in the BNT162b2 group (4.2%) and placebo group (5.7%). The most common 
baseline comorbidities (BNT162b2 vs placebo) were: 
• Premature birth (1.6% vs 2.0%) 
• Asthma (0.8% vs 0.8%) 
• Congenital heart disease (0.8% vs 1.8%) 
No participants in this age group reported having an immunocompromised condition at baseline.

Medical history 
The safety population included children 6 months to <2 years of age with a medical history profile consistent 
with the general population. The SOCs with the most reported medical history PTs, and other select SOCs, 
were: 
Immune system disorders: 9.8% in BNT162b2 and 8.7% in placebo mostly consisting of a variety of non-
drug allergies, also including drug hypersensitivity (0.8% in BNT162b2 and 0.8% in placebo). 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: 9.3% in BNT162b2 and 11.5% in placebo mostly consisting of 
eczema (5.5% in BNT162b2 and 6.9% in placebo) and various types of rashes and dermatitis that may be 
commonly seen in this age group. 
Infections and infestations: 9.3% in BNT162b2 and 10.2% in placebo including a variety of viral and bacterial 
infections that may be commonly seen in this age group. History of COVID-19 (including asymptomatic 
COVID-19) was reported in 8 participants (0.7%) in BNT162b2 group and 8 participants in the placebo group 
(1.3%). 
Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders: 3.3% in BNT162b2 and 3.2% in placebo consisting of 
asthma and other respiratory illnesses that may be commonly seen in this age group. 
Nervous system disorders: 1.1% in BNT162b2 and 0.7% in placebo including seizures and developmental 
disorders that may be commonly seen in this age group. 
Cardiac disorders: reported in 6 participants (0.5%) in the BNT162b2 group including aortic valve stenosis, 
cardiac valve disease, coronary artery disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, long QT syndrome, and 
pulmonary valve stenosis (n=1 each); and 1 participant (0.2%) in the placebo group with history of cardiac 
disorder (not unspecified). Additionally, congenital cardiac conditions (e.g., atrial or ventricular septal 
defects, aorta or aortic valve defects, cardiomyopathy, Fallot's tetralogy) were reported in both BNT162b2 
and placebo groups at low frequencies (≤1%). 
A similar percentage of participants in either group (27.2% in BNT162b2 and 28.8% in placebo) received any 
concomitant vaccine after Dose 1. Most concomitant vaccines received were for influenza and other routine 
pediatric immunizations. 
2.5.5.2.  Adverse events 
Reactogenicity- Phase 1 
Local reactions 
In the 2 to <5 years of age group, pain at the injection site was the most commonly reported local 
reaction within 7 days, incidence after any dose was 65.6% in the 10-μg group compared with 43.8% in the 
3-μg group; redness was reported after any dose in 28.1% versus 0.0%; and swelling after any dose was 
reported in 12.5% versus 0.0%, in the 10-μg and 3-μg groups, respectively. All local reactions were mild or 
moderate in severity. No Grade 4 events were reported at any dose levels. Across dose levels, the median 
onset for most local reactions was 1 to 2 days after Dose 1 or Dose 2, and most events resolved within 1 or 2 
days of onset. 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/890761/2022 
Page 91/155 
 
 
Based on the reactogenicity profile observed in the 2 to <5 years of age group, BNT162b2 at the 3-μg dose 
level was the only dose level tested in the 6 months to <2 years of age group. After Dose 1, the only 
reported local reactions in children 6 months to <2 years of age were mild redness and swelling at the 
injection site (18.8% and 6.3%, respectively). After Dose 2, the only reported local reaction was mild 
tenderness at the injection site (6.3%). All local reactions were mild in severity. No moderate, severe, or 
Grade 4 events were reported. The median onset for most local reactions was within 1 day after Dose 1 or 
Dose 2, and most events resolved within 1 to 4 days of onset. 
Systemic events 
In the 2 to <5 years of age group, fever was reported in 6 participants in the 10-μg dose group after 
either dose. Of these, 2 participants reported fever >38.9 °C to 40 °C after each dose. Fever was reported in 
only 1 participant in the 3-μg dose level group (>38.4 °C to 38.9 °C), after Dose 2. All systemic events were 
mild or moderate in severity. No Grade 4 events were reported at any dose levels. Across dose levels, the 
median onset for most systemic events was 1 to 2 days after Dose 1 or Dose 2, and most events resolved 
within 1 to 2 days of onset. 
In the 6 months to <2 years of age group  reported incidences of systemic events (Dose 1 vs Dose 2) were: 
• Irritability: 43.8% vs 31.3% 
• Drowsiness: 25.0% vs 6.3%  
• Decreased appetite: 6.3% vs 12.5% 
• Fever: 6.3% vs 12.5% 
Fever was reported in 1 participant after Dose 1, and in 2 participants after Dose 2; all of the reported fevers 
were <38.4 °C. Antipyretic or pain medication use was dose number dependent, reported by 18.8% of 
participants after Dose 1 with no reported use after Dose 2. All systemic events were mild or moderate in 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation

severity within 7 days after Dose 1 and Dose 2. No severe or Grade 4 events were reported. The median 
onset for most systemic events was 1 to 2 days after Dose 1 or Dose 2, and most events resolved within 1 to 
3 days of onset.  
Reactogenicity – Phase 2/3 
Local reactions 
Among children aged 2 to <5 Years, local reactions and systemic events were assessed for Phase 2/3 
participants 2 to <5 years of age for 7 days after each dose, with e-diary data from N=1825 after Dose 1, 
N=1779 after Dose 2, and N=552 after Dose 3 of BNT162b2 3-μg; and N=909 after Dose 1, N=878 after 
Dose 2, and N=262 after Dose 3 of placebo. 
Most local reactions were mild or moderate, with severe local reactions reported infrequently after any dose 
(≤0.1%). No Grade 4 local reactions were reported after any dose. The median onset for all local reactions 
after any dose of BNT162b2 3-μg was 1 to 2 days, and all events resolved within a median duration of 1 day 
after onset. 
Figure 3. Participants reporting local reactions by maximum severity within 7d after each dose-phase 2/3-blinded placebo-
controlled follow up period 2 to <5yo-safetu population.  
A separate analysis was performed for 120 participants with e-diary data who received Dose 1 and Dose 2 at 
the randomized dose level of BNT162b2 3-μg, and then turned 5 years of age prior to Dose 3 and therefore 
received Dose 3 at the age-appropriate 10-μg dose level in an open-label manner. For these participants, 
local reactions showed a dose level-dependent increase after Dose 3 compared to after Dose 2. 
After any of three doses of BNT162b2 3-μg, the frequency and pattern of local reactions in baseline positive 
children was similar to those who were baseline negative and did not suggest any clinically meaningful

difference based on prior infection status. Subgroup analyses were performed based on sex, race and 
ethnicity, and there were no meaningful differences in the overall patterns of local reactions across these 
subgroups. 
Among children aged 6 Months to <2 Years, local reactions and systemic events were assessed for Phase 
2/3 participants 6 months to <2 years of age for 7 days after each dose, with e-diary data from N=1173 after 
Dose 1, N=1147 after Dose 2, and N=365 after Dose 3 of BNT162b2 3-μg; and N=595 after Dose 1, N=591 
after Dose 2, and N=170 after Dose 3 of placebo. 
Incidences of any local reactions at the injection site after each dose in children aged 6 Months to <2 Years 
were: 
Most local reactions were mild or moderate, with severe local reactions reported infrequently after any dose 
(≤0.3%). No Grade 4 local reactions were reported after any dose. The median onset for all local reactions 
after any dose of BNT162b2 3-μg was 1 to 2 days, and most events resolved within a median duration of 1 
day after onset. 
Subgroup analyses were performed based on sex, race and ethnicity, and there were no meaningful 
differences in the overall patterns of local reactions across these subgroups. 
Systemic events 
Among children aged 2 to <5 Years, Fatigue was the most frequently reported systemic event reported 
within 7 days after each dose, at similar frequencies in the BNT162b2 and placebo group. Most systemic 
events were mild or moderate, with severe systemic events reported infrequently after any dose (≤0.6%). 
No Grade 4 events were reported after any dose. The median onset for most systemic events after any dose 
of BNT162b2 3-μg was 2 days (noting that some events had median onset of up to 6 days post-dose, which 
was similar in BNT162b2 and placebo groups), and most events resolved within a median duration of 1 day 
after onset.

Fever 38.9 °C to 40 °C was reported by ≤1.1% of participants in the BNT162b2 group and ≤1.1% in the 
placebo group, after each of the three doses. The overall median onset for fevers in either group was 4 to 5 
days post-dose, and fevers all resolved in a median duration of 1 to 1.5 days. Three participants, all in the 
BNT162b2 group, reported a fever >40.0 °C after Dose 1 or Dose 2, one of whom had a clinical presentation 
suggestive of viral exanthem. These include: 
•  A participant reported a fever of 40.8 °C on Day 2 post-Dose 1 and persisting through Day 5 
(temperatures on Days 3 to 5 were: 40.7 °C, 40.5 °C, 38.4 °C) and returned to normal body 
temperature (37.7 °C) on Day 6 with reported antipyretic/pain medication use. The fever was also 
reported as a nonserious AE of pyrexia considered by the investigator as related to study intervention 
and led to withdrawal. This participant reported no other AEs or Grade 3 systemic events. 
•  A participant reported fever starting on Day 3 post-Dose 2 and persisting through Day 7 
(temperatures on Days 3 to 7 were: 39.5 °C, 40.3 °C, 39.6 °C, 39.1 °C, 38.0 °C). The fever was also 
reported as a severe SAE of pyrexia, with a concurrent SAE of pain in extremity (calf pain) with onset 
6 days post-Dose 2 and nonserious AE of rash (chest, upper back, and ear) with onset 7 days post-
Dose 2, all considered by the investigator as related to study intervention and resolved within 2 to 4 
days of onset. This participant reported no other AEs or Grade 3 systemic events. Antipyretic/pain 
medication use was reported for the event(s). The events are described with severe AEs, SAEs and 
AESI of rash. The clinical presentation, (i.e., defervescence and development of a rash on the face 
and chest) is suggestive of a viral exanthem such as roseola as a possible diagnosis (based on 
sponsor assessment). 
•  A participant reported fever of 39.9 °C on Day 5 post-Dose 2, persisting to Day 7 (temperatures on 
Days 6 and 7 were: 40.3 °C 38.7 °C). This participant reported no other Grade 3 systemic events or 
any AEs. No antipyretic/pain medication use was reported 
A separate analysis was performed for 120 participants with e-diary data who received Dose 1 and Dose 2 at 
the randomized dose level of BNT162b2 3-μg, and then turned 5 years of age prior to Dose 3 and therefore 
received Dose 3 at the age-appropriate 10-μg dose level in an open-label manner. For these participants, 
events of fever, fatigue, headache, and chills showed a dose level-dependent increase after Dose 3 compared 
to after Dose 2, whereas other events remained similar or showed no clear pattern after each subsequent 
dose. 
Subgroup analyses were performed based on sex, race, ethnicity and baseline SARS-CoV-2 status, and there 
were no meaningful differences in the overall patterns of systemic events across these subgroups. 
Among children 6 Months to <2 Years of Age, irritability was the most frequently reported systemic event 
reported within 7 days after each dose, followed by drowsiness and decreased appetite. 
Incidences of any systemic events and antipyretic/pain medication use after each dose in children aged 6 
Months to <2 Years were: 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation

Most systemic events were mild or moderate, with severe systemic events reported infrequently after any 
dose (≤1.1%). No Grade 4 events were reported after any dose. The median onset for most systemic events 
after any dose of BNT162b2 3-μg was 2 days (noting that some events had median onset of up to 4.5 days 
post-dose, which was similar in BNT162b2 and placebo groups), and all events resolved within a median 
duration of 1 to 2 days after onset. Fever 38.9 °C to 40 °C was reported by ≤2.0% of participants in the 
BNT162b2 group and ≤1.2% in the placebo group, after each of the three doses. The overall median onset 
for fevers in either group was 2 to 4.5 days post-dose, and all reported fevers resolved in a median duration 
of 1 day. Three participants in the BNT162b2 group reported a fever >40.0 °C (n=1 each post-Dose 1, Dose 
2, Dose 3), two of whom had a concurrent viral infection (roseola or unknown). These were: 
•  A participant reported fever of 40.6 °C on Day 2 post-Dose 1 that persisted through Day 4 
(temperatures on Days 3 to 4 were: 39.0 °C, 38.1 °C) and returned to normal body temperature 
(37.2 °C) on Day 5 with reported antipyretic medication use. The fever was also reported as a 
nonserious AE of severe pyrexia considered by the investigator as related to study intervention and 
leading to withdrawal; this participant had a concurrent nonserious AE of exanthema subitum 
(attributed to a viral infection) considered as not related to study intervention that resolved in 4 days. 
This participant reported no other AEs or Grade 3 systemic events. 
•  A participant reported fever starting on Day 1 post-Dose 2 and persisting through Day 5 
(temperatures on Days 1 to 5 were: 39.2 °C, 39.5 °C, 40.5 °C, 38.4 °C, 39.1 °C) and returned to 
normal body temperature (37.1 °C) on Day 6 with reported antipyretic/pain medication use. Other 
reported Grade 3 systemic events, all of which were post-Dose 2, were drowsiness on Days 1-2 and 
Days 5-6 and irritability on Day 2 and Day 5. Based on clinical presentation at an unscheduled illness 
visit, the participant was diagnosed with roseola. This participant reported no AEs in blinded follow-
up; after unblinding, an unrelated AE of vomiting (attributed to food exposure) was reported post-
Dose 2 (prior to open-label Dose 3). 
•  A participant reported fever of 40.5 °C starting on Day 3 post-Dose 3 and persisting through Day 4 
(temperatures on Day 3 and Day 4 were: 40.5 °C and 39.5 °C, with no temperature reported on Day 
5) and returned to normal body temperature on Day 6 (37.8 °C). The fever was also reported as an 
AE leading to withdrawal and is included in severe AE analysis. The event was considered by the 
investigator as related to study intervention. This participant reported no other AEs or Grade 3 
systemic events. No antipyretic/pain medication use was reported. 
One participant in the placebo group had fever >40.0 °C (post-Dose 1). This was: 
•  A participant reported fever of 40.4 °C on Day 5 post-Dose 1 that returned to normal on Day 6 (37.5 
°C). This participant reported no AEs or other Grade 3 systemic events. 
Due to an anomaly in the eCRF data collection on symptom resolution for events of fever in the 6 months to 
<2 years of age group, if a fever was ongoing on Day 7 of the reactogenicity period, duration was considered 
‘unknown’. This data collection issue was documented as a quality event expected to be resolved by the time 
of the future licensure application for this age group. Additional analyses of systemic events that included any 
e-diary data reported after a participant was unblinded did not suggest any meaningful differences in the 
reactogenicity profile. 
Subgroup analyses were performed based on sex, race, ethnicity and baseline SARS-CoV-2 status, and there 
were no meaningful differences in the overall patterns of systemic events across these subgroups.

Subgroup Analyses on AEs from Dose 1 to 1 Month After Dose 3, Phase 2/3, 2 to <5 years 
Subgroups of Phase 2/3 pediatric participants 2 to <5 years of age had similar AE profiles from Dose 1 to 1 
month after Dose 3, overall and categorically (i.e., related, or severe events) across the BNT162b2 and 
placebo groups when evaluated by sex, race, ethnicity, and baseline SARS-CoV-2 status. 
Subgroups of race (Black or African American, Asian, multiracial), ethnicity (Hispanic/Latino) and baseline 
SARS-CoV-2 status (positive) included a limited number of participants, and their results should be 
interpreted with caution. While there were some numerical differences between subgroups, there were no 
meaningful differences in the overall patterns of AEs by category across these subgroups. There were some 
higher frequencies reported in females compared to males. However, in the BNT162b2 group, the overall 
incidences of participants 2 to <5 years of age reporting at least 1 AE were 18.5% for male participants and 
19.0% for female participants. 
Adverse Events from Dose 1 to Data Cutoff Date  
From Dose 1 to the data cutoff date, the proportions of participants with any AE up to the cutoff date were 
similar in the BNT162b2 (18.8%) and placebo (18.9%) groups. To events already reported up to 1 month 
after Dose 3 (Table below), a limited number of additional events were reported up to the data cutoff date. 
As of the data cutoff date, any related or any SAEs were reported across the BNT162b2 and placebo groups 
by 2.0% or ≤0.7% of participants, respectively. No additional SAEs or withdrawals due to AEs were reported 
in either group beyond 1-month post-Dose 3. No study participants died.

Three participants in the BNT162b2 group experienced nonserious AEs of pain in extremity. Two were 
considered by the investigator as not related to study intervention and they resolved within 2 days. Arthralgia 
was reported in 2 participants in the BNT162b2 group, both cases was related to fall from coach or tree. 
Two cases of febrile convulsion were reported in the BNT162b2 group, one participant who experienced fever 
and febrile convulsions 43 days after dose2 which resolved within 1 day, and one participant that 
experienced febrile convulsions 21 days post dose1 which resolved within 1 day (both cases are further 
described in section SAE). Two events of epilepsy/status epilepticus were reported, one in a participant 
who was hospitalized 47 days after receiving dose2 and 3 days after receiving influenza vaccine, one event 
was reported 18 days after dose1 in the setting of a urinary tract infection. Both events were reported as 
unrelated SAEs. 
One case with anaphylactic reaction was reported in a participant the BNT162b2 group 5 days after dose. 
The participant did not have shortness of breath or hypotension. The participant developed a pruritic rash 
around the mouth as well as a generalized rash on the body along with abdominal pain and wheezing. The 
participant was seen at an urgent care clinic and the reaction resolved. The event was considered by the 
investigator as not related to study intervention. A participant experienced hypoacusis (hearing

impairment) 65 and 153 days after dose 2. According to otolaryngologist, the first episode of hypoacusis 
was due to adenoid hypertrophy, and the second episode of hypoacusis was probably due to multiple 
episodes of secretory otitis media. On Day 210, the hypoacusis resolved. The events were considered by the 
investigator as not related to study intervention. 
Related Adverse Events – Dose 1 to 1 Month After Dose 3 – 2 to <5 Years of Age 
From Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 3, AEs assessed by the investigator as related to study intervention were 
reported with similar frequencies in the BNT162b2 (2.0%) and placebo (2.0%) groups. Most related AEs were 
consistent with reactogenicity events and in the SOC of general disorders and administration site conditions, 
reported by 1.4% of participants in the BNT162b2 group compared with 1.2% of participants in the placebo 
group. 
Immediate Adverse Events – After Each Dose – 2 to <5 Years of Age 
Immediate AEs reported within 30 minutes of vaccination were low in frequency after any dose (≤0.3%) of 
BNT162b2 or placebo. No immediate events of anaphylaxis were reported after any vaccination. After Dose 1, 
immediate AEs in the BNT162b2 group were skin abrasion, erythema, injection site bruising, and injury 
associated with device (0.1% each); and in the placebo group were injection site pain (0.2%), injection site 
erythema, and injection site swelling (0.1% each). After Dose 2, immediate AEs in the BNT162b2 group were 
injection site pain, injection site erythema, rash erythematous, and urticaria (0.1% each); and in the placebo 
group were injection site erythema and injection site swelling (0.1% each).No immediate AEs were reported 
after Dose 3 in either group. 
Severe or Life-Threatening Adverse Events – Dose 1 to 1 Month After Dose 3 – 2 to <5 Years of 
Age 
AEs were reported by ≤0.7% of participants in both the BNT162b2 and placebo groups. Most of the events 
considered as severe were unrelated SAEs. No life-threatening (i.e., Grade 4) AEs were reported from Dose 1 
to 1 month after Dose 3. In the BNT162b2 group, severe AEs included pyrexia, bilateral deafness, 
appendicitis, viral gastroenteritis, skin laceration, epilepsy, status epilepticus, and adenoidal hypertrophy 
(0.1% each). 
The status epilepticus was reported as an unrelated SAE that led to study withdrawal.  
The events of epilepsy, appendicitis, and viral gastroenteritis were also reported as unrelated SAEs. 
The event of pyrexia was reported as a related SAE and recorded in the e-diary as a systemic event. The 
unrelated bilateral deafness is discussed above in AE analysis by SOC/PT. Epilepsy and appendicitis events 
are also included in the AESI analysis. 
In the placebo group, severe AEs were macular rash, bronchial hyperreactivity, epilepsy, febrile convulsion, 
fall, and conjunctivitis (0.1% each). The events of bronchial hyperreactivity, epilepsy, and febrile convulsion 
were reported as unrelated SAEs. The events of febrile convulsions or epilepsy are also included in the AESI 
analysis.

Adverse Events from Dose 1 to Data Cutoff Date 
Few additional AEs were reported from Dose 1 to the data cutoff date (29 April 2022). Overall, frequencies of 
any AEs reported after Dose 1 up the data cutoff date were similar in the BNT162b2 and placebo groups 
(18.8% vs 18.9%). Many of the AEs were consistent with reactogenicity events (e.g., vomiting, pyrexia, and 
fatigue). Overall, most of the additional AEs reported after 1-month post-Dose 3 up to the data cutoff date 
consisted of unrelated viral infections, fevers, and other minor illnesses and injuries typical for this age group 
in the general pediatric population. Additional analyses of AEs from Dose 1 to the data cutoff that included 
events reported after a participant was unblinded, or that were reported for the original placebo group after 
unblinding to receive active vaccination with BNT162b2, did not suggest any meaningful differences in safety 
profile. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) There were no cases reported in the 2 to <5 years of age 
group as of the data cutoff date (29 April 2022) of myocarditis/pericarditis, Bell’s palsy (or facial 
paralysis/paresis), or vaccine-related anaphylaxis. AEs of clinical interest that were identified in the safety 
database as of the data cutoff date included lymphadenopathy and appendicitis, which are summarized 
below. 
Lymphadenopathy: Lymphadenopathy is considered an adverse reaction to this vaccine and is noted as 
such in the product labelling. Based on AE analysis during blinded follow-up from Dose 1 to 1-month post-
Dose 3, 1 case of lymphadenopathy was reported by 1 participant (0.1%) in the BNT162b2 group and none 
in the placebo group. The case of lymphadenopathy occurred 2 days post dose 2 and resolved within 6 days. 
The event was considered related to study intervention. Lymphadenopathy is included in section 4.8 in the 
product information.  
Appendicitis: Two events of appendicitis were reported, both in the BNT162b2 group and both reported as 
unrelated SAEs. In one case, the participant had acute appendicitis and localized peritonitis with onset 105 
days post-Dose 2 and both resolved the next day. In the other case, the participant had appendicitis with 
onset 11 days post-Dose 2 that resolved the same day (see details section SAE). 
MedDRA Standardized MedDRA Query (SMQ) Analysis: Based on previous FDA requests for AEs of 
clinical interest in prior submissions, the following MedDRA Standardized MedDRA Query (SMQ) searches 
were performed on the safety data: Angioedema, Arthritis, Convulsions, Demyelination, Hypersensitivity, 
Peripheral Neuropathy and Vasculitis. No events were identified consistent with demyelination, peripheral 
neuropathy, or vasculitis. Additional notable pertinent negatives from safety review (i.e., no cases reported in 
this population as of the data cutoff date) included but were not limited to thrombocytopenic events, 
thromboembolic or intravascular coagulation events, autoimmune events, meningitis, encephalitis, neuritis, 
Kawasaki disease, MIS-C, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Events that were identified in the search 
were in the angioedema, hypersensitivity, arthritis, and convulsions SMQs which are summarized below and, 
in the following table. The incidence of angioedema (SMQ) events was similar in the BNT162b2 and placebo 
groups (0.4%), and the incidence of hypersensitivity (SMQ) events was higher in the BNT162b2 group 
(0.9%) compared to the placebo group (0.4%).Rash is considered an adverse reaction to this vaccine and is 
noted as such in the product labelling. Rashes were reported infrequently in the SMQ analysis for children 2 
to <5 years of age, but at a slightly higher incidence in the BNT162b2 group (0.4%) than placebo (0.1%).  
Other events from this SMQ analysis reported in the BNT162b2 group included 6 events of urticaria (n=6), 
contact or atopic dermatitis (n=2 each), eczema (n=1), eyelid swelling (n=1), and allergic cough or rhinitis 
(n=2 each). Of these, 4 cases of urticaria were considered as related to study intervention and all others 
were considered as not related.

Subgroup Analyses 
Subgroups of Phase 2/3 paediatric participants 6 months to <2 years of age had similar AE profiles from 
Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 3, overall and categorically (i.e., related or severe events) across the 
BNT162b2 and placebo groups when evaluated by sex, race, ethnicity, and baseline SARS-CoV-2 status. 
Subgroups of race (Black or African American, Asian, multiracial), ethnicity (Hispanic/Latino) and baseline 
SARS-CoV-2 status (positive) included a limited number of participants, and their results should be 
interpreted with caution. While there were some numerical differences between subgroups, there were no 
meaningful differences in the overall patterns of AEs by category across these subgroups.

Infections and illnesses typical of this age group were also reported with no clinically meaningful imbalance 
between groups. This AE profile is generally consistent with that observed for other age groups, that is, most 
events are either reactogenicity or age-appropriate occurrences expected in the general population. 
Analysis of AEs from Dose 1 to 1-month post-Dose 2 and from Dose 3 to 1-month post-Dose 3 overall and by 
Tier 2 events did not suggest any safety concerns.

Select AEs that were reported from Dose 1 to 1-month post-Dose 3 that according to the MAH merit 
additional detail to provide a fuller clinical picture are summarized below. 
Leukopenia/Thrombocytopenia  
A participant with a medical history of long QT syndrome, received Dose 1 BNT162b2 (3 µg) in Q2 2021 and 
Dose 2 BNT162b2 (3 µg) on Day 28. Fourteen days after receiving Dose 1 clinical laboratory tests showed 
leukocytes 2400/mm3 (RR: 4500-13,000/mm3) (reported as leukocytopenia, non-SAE, grade 2) and 
thrombocyte platelets count 113,000/mm3 (RR: 227,000-550,000/mm3) (reported as thrombocytopenia, 
non-SAE, Grade 2). COVID-19 test was negative. The participant developed a fever, loss of appetite, and 
drowsiness, was less active on Day 15, and a diagnosis of stomatitis was made on Day 16 (reported as 
herpetic stomatitis, non-SAE, grade 1, resolved on Day 18). Laboratory tests on Day 27, were within the RRs 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation

(leukocytes 6500/mm3 and platelets 289,000/mm3) and thrombocytopenia and leukocytopenia considered 
resolved (in summary by the assessor with information from safety narrative) In the opinion of the 
investigator, there was a reasonable possibility that the leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were related to the 
study intervention. Thrombocytopenia and leukocytopenia are not described as AEs in the SmPC but nor 
thrombocytopenia or leukocytopenia presented in this case were profound and both events fully resolved. 
Stomatitis, fever and loss of appetite may indicate other infection(s), and this could also have caused this 
transient and small affection on thrombocytes and leucocytes. At rechallenge (dose 2 on Day 28) no new AEs 
were reported.  
Neutropenia 
further discussed also including other reported AE (gastroenteritis) in section SAEs 
Gait disturbance 
A participant developed nonserious mild right leg limping of unknown origin in 6 days post-Dose 1 of 
BNT162b2 that resolved the next day The event was considered by the investigator as not related to study 
intervention and did not recur with the second dose and agreed. 
Vertigo 
A participant had vertigo 12 days post-Dose 1 of BNT162b2 (reported as non-SAE, Grade 1) and was 
assessed by the investigator as attributed to motion  12 days post-Dose 1 of BNT162b2. The vertigo resolved 
and is assessed by the investigator as not related and this is agreed.  
Seizure/febrile seizure  
2 events of seizure were reported in the BNT162b2 group  
A participant with no pertinent medical history, received Dose 1 BNT162b2 (3 µg) in Q1 2022 and Dose 2 
BNT162b2 (3 µg) on Day 55. The participant experienced a febrile convulsion (reported as SAE, Grade 2), 38 
days after receiving Dose 1, and was admitted to the hospital. This case is further described in Section SAE.  
A participant with no pertinent medical history, received Dose 1 BNT162b2 (3 µg) in Q3 2021 and Dose 2 
BNT162b2 (3 µg) on Day 22. The participant experienced a seizure (reported as non-SAE, Grade 3), 163 
days after receiving Dose 2 and was unresponsive for approximately 60 seconds, with no jerking movements 
and some blue discoloration of skin. After gaining consciousness, the participant experienced a period of 
lethargy and fussiness for 10 to 15 minutes. Blood glucose was normal (84 mg/dL), but the participant was 
noted to have chest congestion. Laboratory testing detecting rotavirus in a stool sample and 2 
electrocardiograms (ECGs) that showed possible borderline left ventricular hypertrophy. The participant was 
discharged from the hospital with a diagnosis of rotavirus infection. Approximately seven months after 
receiving dose 1, the participant was evaluated by a neurologist and neurological examination results were 
normal. The results of the EEG performed were normal. Later that month, the participant was evaluated by a 
cardiologist: echocardiogram (normal) and ECG (normal). 
Both cases described above occurred >30 days after vaccination and were considered by the investigator and 
the MAH as not related to study intervention and is agreed. 
A participant in the BNT162b2 group had an SAE of seizure (Grade 1) with unknown cause, with onset 3 days 
post-Dose 2 and resolved. This case is further described in Section SAE. 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/890761/2022

Serum sickness 
A participant who had mild serum sickness (described as full body rash) (reported as non-SAE, Grade 1) with 
onset 31 days post-Dose 2 of BNT162b2 and was according to the investigator attributed to antibiotic 
treatment and resolved in 6 days. It is noted that the MAH informs that this case included in AESI analysis 
but no further information is found.  
Pyrexia 
A participant  experienced pyrexia (reported as non-SAE, Grade 2), 2 days after receiving Dose 3, duration 3 
days with maximum temp 104.9°F (40.5°C). In the opinion of the investigator, there was a reasonable 
possibility that the pyrexia was related to the study intervention and led to withdrawal. This case is further 
described (in section discontinuation due to AEs). 
A participant who developed pyrexia (reported as non-SAE, Grade 3, related). A diagnosis of exanthema 
subitum was made on 1 day after receiving Dose 1. The participant was withdrawn from the study because of 
the pyrexia. This case is further described in section discontinuation due to AEs. 
Anaphylactic reaction  
One participant in the BNT162b2 group  and 1 participant in the placebo group  each had unrelated SAEs of 
anaphylaxis (both attributed to food allergic reactions), with the events resolving within a day of onset. These 
cases are detailed in the section for SAE. 
Cyanosis 
A participant in the placebo group had a severe SAE of cyanosis with onset 5 days post-Dose 1 and resolved 
the same day. The event was considered by the investigator as related to study intervention. An extensive 
medical work-up was performed in the Emergency Room with normal findings, and the child was discharged 
home with no further abnormalities noted.  
One participant was reported with cyanosis 172 days post-Dose 2 placebo, assessed by the investigator as 
caused by abdominal pain, and resolved.  
Related Adverse Events – Dose 1 to 1 Month After Dose 3 – 6 Months to <2 Years of Age  
AEs assessed by the investigator as related to study intervention were reported at a slightly higher frequency 
in the BNT162b2 group (4.7%) than in the placebo group (3.5%). Most related AEs were consistent with 
reactogenicity events, most reported in both the BNT162b2 and placebo groups from the SOCs of general 
disorders and administration site conditions (1.6% and 0.7%) and gastrointestinal disorders (1.4% and 
1.3%) (Table below).

Immediate Adverse Events 
Immediate AEs reported within 30 minutes of vaccination were low in frequency after any dose (≤0.5%) of 
BNT162b2 or placebo. No immediate events of anaphylaxis were reported after any vaccination. After Dose 1, 
immediate AEs in the BNT162b2 group were vomiting, injection site erythema, and hematoma (0.1% each); 
and none in the placebo group. 
After Dose 2, immediate AEs in the BNT162b2 group were injection site erythema (0.2%) and injection site 
swelling and rash (0.1% each); and in the placebo group were vomiting, injection site erythema, scratch, and 
flushing (0.2% each). No immediate AEs were reported after Dose 3 in either group.  
Severe or Life-Threatening Adverse Events – Dose 1 to 1 Month After Dose 3  
Severe (Grade 3) AEs reported from Dose 1 to 1-month post-Dose 3 were reported at similar incidences in 
the BNT162b2 (1.0%) and placebo (1.8%) groups. Most severe AEs were gastrointestinal or respiratory 
infections/illnesses reported as unrelated SAEs, with no imbalance between groups. 
One life-threatening (i.e., Grade 4) AEs was reported from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 3, by a participant 
in the placebo group who had a thermal burn that was reported as a non-related SAE. 
In the BNT162b2 group, notable severe events included: 
•  1 participant had severe, non-serious neutropenia (as described in section SAE). 
•  1 participant had pyrexia 2 days after Dose 1 that led to withdrawal (see section discontinuation) and 
was assessed by the investigator as severe and related to study intervention; a concurrent AE of 
exanthema subitum (attributed to a viral infection) considered not related to study intervention; both 
events resolved within 4 days.

•  1 participant with a history of nut allergy reported had an unrelated event of severe anaphylactic reaction 
caused by a nut allergy, also reported as an SAE (see section SAE) and included in the AESI analysis. 
•  1 participant was reported having an anaphylactoid reaction that resolved (reported as SAE, grade 3) 
directly after eating nut. The participant had received dose 1 BNT162b2 (3µg) 15 days before this event 
and was assessed as by the investigator and MAH as not related to the study intervention or clinical trial 
procedures but was considered related to a nut allergy, that is agreed by the assessor (for details see 
section SAE). 
•  2 participants had unrelated severe events of febrile convulsion or seizure (n=1 each), (for details see 
section SAE). 
In the placebo group, 2 severe events of cyanosis were reported as SAEs (described above), one attributable 
to ‘abdominal pain’ and one of unknown aetiology both assessed as unrelated. 
Subgroup Analyses 
Subgroups had similar AE profiles from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 3, across the BNT162b2 and placebo 
groups when evaluated by sex, race, ethnicity, and baseline SARS-CoV-2 status. Subgroups of race (Black or 
African American, Asian, multiracial), ethnicity (Hispanic/Latino) and baseline SARS-CoV-2 status (positive) 
included a limited number of participants, and their results should be interpreted with caution. In general, the 
AE profiles within each subgroup were similar to the overall AE profile for the safety population as whole, 
reflecting events consistent with reactogenicity and other childhood illnesses and injuries that are commonly 
reported in the general pediatric population. While there were some numerical differences between 
subgroups, there were no meaningful differences in the overall patterns of AEs by category across these 
subgroups. 
Adverse Events from Dose 1 to Data Cutoff Date 
Few additional AEs were reported from Dose 1 to the data cutoff date (29 April 2022) for participants 6 
months to <2 years. Overall, frequencies of any AEs reported after Dose 1 up to the data cutoff date were 
similar in the BNT162b2 and placebo groups (30.3% vs 27.3%). 
Many of the AEs were consistent with reactogenicity events (e.g., vomiting, pyrexia, and fatigue). Overall, 
most of the additional AEs reported after 1-month post-Dose 3 up to the data cutoff date consisted of 
unrelated viral infections, fevers, and other minor illnesses and injuries typical for this age group in the 
general pediatric population. Additional analyses of AEs from Dose 1 to the data cutoff that included events 
reported after a participant was unblinded, or that were reported for the original placebo group after 
unblinding to receive active vaccination with BNT162b2, did not suggest any meaningful differences in the 
safety profile.  
•  One nonserious case of anaphylactic reaction was reported in the BNT162b2 group, considered not 
related to study intervention, by a participant after they were unblinded in the study (therefore not 
included in summary tables of blinded placebo-controlled AEs). This  participant had a pertinent medical 
history of eczema, multiple food allergies, and eczema coxsackium, received Dose 1 BNT162b2 (3 µg) in 
Q2 2021, Dose 2 BNT162b2 (3 µg) on Day 22, and Dose 3 BNT162b2 (3 µg) on Day 246. The participant 
experienced an anaphylactic reaction, 64 days after receiving Dose 3 BNT162b2 (3 µg) (reported as non-
SAE grade). The trigger for this event was unknown. The participant presented with vomiting and

pruritus, which are the same symptoms that the participant experienced during prior allergic episodes. 
The participant got treatment at home and at the hospital. All symptoms lasted no more than 1 hour, and 
the event resolved the same day. In the opinion of the investigator, there was no reasonable possibility 
that the anaphylactic reaction was related to the study intervention, and this is agreed. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 
There were no cases reported in the 6 months to <2 years of age group as of the data cutoff date (29 April 
2022) of myocarditis/pericarditis, Bell’s palsy (or facial paralysis/paresis), appendicitis, or vaccine-related 
anaphylaxis. 
AEs of clinical interest that were identified in the safety database as of the data cutoff date included 
lymphadenopathy as summarized below. 
Lymphadenopathy 
Lymphadenopathy is considered an adverse reaction to this vaccine and is noted as such in the product 
labelling. Based on AE analysis from Dose 1 to 1-month post-Dose 3 during blinded follow-up , 
lymphadenopathy was reported in 2 participants (0.2%) in theBNT162b2 group and none in the placebo 
group. Lymphadenopathy is already included in section 4,8 of the product information. 
Details of these cases are as follows:  
•  A participant was noted to have a neck mass of unspecified size 24 days post-Dose 2 of BNT162b2 
(administered in the left thigh), considered as not related to study intervention. The participant was seen 
in Q1 2022 by an ear nose and throat specialist who conducted an ultrasound and diagnosed the mass as 
a swollen lymph node of unknown etiology, with no other symptoms reported; follow-up with the 
specialist and with the pediatrician was scheduled. 
•  A participant, had a mild enlarged left leg lymph node (groin) on 2 days post-Dose 2 of BNT162b2 
(administered in the left thigh), resolved in 3 days, and was considered by the investigator as related to 
study intervention and this assessment is agreed. 
SMQ Analysis Based on previous FDA requests for AEs of clinical interest in prior submissions, the following 
MedDRA Standardized MedDRA Query (SMQ) searches were performed on the safety data: Angioedema, 
Arthritis, Convulsions, Demyelination, Hypersensitivity, Peripheral Neuropathy and Vasculitis. No events were 
identified consistent with arthritis, demyelination, peripheral neuropathy, or vasculitis. Additional notable 
pertinent negatives from safety review (ie, no cases reported in this population as of the data cutoff date) 
included but were not limited to thrombocytopenic events, thromboembolic or intravascular coagulation 
events, autoimmune events, meningitis, encephalitis, neuritis, Kawasaki disease, MIS-C, or acute respiratory 
distress syndrome. 
Events that were identified in the search were in the angioedema, hypersensitivity, and convulsions SMQs 
which are summarized below. The safety review using SMQs was based on AEs reported from Dose 1 to 1-
month post-Dose 3 during blinded and placebo-controlled follow-up.

Angioedema/Hypersensitivity 
The incidence of angioedema (SMQ) events was similar in the BNT162b2 (0.8%) and placebo (0.7%) groups, 
and the incidence of hypersensitivity (SMQ) events was similar in the BNT162b2 group (2.1%) compared to 
the placebo group (2.0%). Rash is considered an adverse reaction to this vaccine and is noted as such in the 
product labelling. Rashes were reported infrequently in the SMQ analysis for children 6 months to <2 years of 
age and at similar incidences in the BNT162b2 (1.1%) and placebo (1.2%) groups. In the BNT162b2 group, 
these included 13 events (including PTs of vessel puncture site rash, rash, rash erythematous, rash macular, 
rash maculo-papular) of which 7 events were considered by the investigator as related to vaccination. Rashes 
assessed as related to vaccination were typically mild to moderate, occurred in anatomical locations of 
extremities (upper and lower), torso, or face with typical onset of 1 to 5 days post-dose, and most resolved 
within 6 days of onset.  
•  One participant in the BNT162b2 group had a rash (generalized rash on face and trunk) on 6 days post-
Dose 1 resolving in 4 days, that led to withdrawal (described in section withdrawal). 
Other events from this SMQ analysis reported in the BNT162b2 group included events of urticaria (n=8), 
dermatitis or dermatitis atopic/contact (n=1 each), eczema (n=5), eyelid swelling (n=1), Of these, 1 case of 
urticaria was considered as related to study intervention and all others were considered as not related. 
• 
Two unrelated severe anaphylactic reactions (attributed to food allergic reactions) were reported (n=1 
each in the BNT162b2 and placebo groups) in participants with medical histories of pre-existing food 
allergies; both were reported as SAEs. 
•  One unrelated event of mild serum sickness (full body rash) was reported in 1 participant in the 
BNT162b2 group (attributed to amoxicillin treatment), with onset 31 days post-Dose 2 and resolved in 6 
days  
•  One unrelated event of drug eruption (attributed to Amoxicillin allergy) was reported by a participant in 
the BNT162b2 group with onset on Day 30 post-Dose 2 and resolved in 3 days. 
•  One unrelated event of hypersensitivity (unknown cause) was reported by a participant in the BNT162b2 
group with onset 59 days post-Dose 2 and resolved the same day. 
•  One unrelated event of mild drug hypersensitivity (attributed to a new drug allergy to penicillin) was 
reported in a participant in the placebo group with onset 15 days post-Dose 1 who also had concurrent 
urticaria (rash on trunk, face, and bilateral extremities) that was reported as resolved 5 days later. 
Convulsions 
Convulsions were reported at the similar incidences in the BNT162b2 (0.3%) and placebo (0.2%) groups. The 
two events are described at section SAE.

2.5.5.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Phase 2/3 - 2 to <5 Years of Age 
Deaths  
No deaths were reported in the Phase 2/3 pediatric population of children 2 to <5 years of age up to the data 
cutoff date. 
Serious Adverse Events from Dose 1 to Data Cutoff Date 
Few SAEs were reported during blinded placebo-controlled follow-up in BNT162b2 3-μg (0.7%) and placebo 
(0.9%) groups from Dose 1 to the data cutoff date. 
Few SAEs were during blinded placebo-controlled follow-up in BNT162b2 3-μg (0.7%) and placebo (0.9%) 
groups from Dose 1 to the data cutoff date. Most SAEs were gastrointestinal or respiratory 
infections/illnesses, with no imbalance between groups (considering 2:1 randomization). SAEs are 
summarized by the assessor below. 
Pyrexia, pain in extremity, rash  
Two SAEs reported by the same participant in the BNT162b2 group were considered by the investigator as 
related to study intervention, which included pyrexia accompanied by viral exanthem after receiving the 
second dose. This concerned a participant without a pertinent medical history who had pyrexia (40.3°C) 
(reported as SAE, Grade 2) 2 days post-Dose 2 that resolved in 5 days (also reported as a systemic 
event).The participant was seen in the hospital for the pyrexia and discharged home the same day in good 
condition. The fever was followed 3 days later by a pain in extremity (reported as SAE, Grade 2), 
characterized by limping while walking, that resolved in 3 days. The participant was hospitalized where his 
physical examinations, X-rays and ultrasound of lower extremity were normal. Clinical laboratory showed 
blood creatine kinase of 491, 1878 and 1503 IU/L (RR not reported), erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 17 
and 20 mm/h (RR: 0-15 mm/h), C-reactive protein of 11, white blood cell count of 3.1, 2.9 and 1.8 (RR:4.5-
13.5 × 109/L), thrombocytes 137 × 109/L (RR: 180-400 × 109/L). On the day pyrexia resolved, a nonserious 
AE of rash (Grade 2) on his chest, upper back, and ear developed that was also assessed as related and 
resolved in 2 days. In the opinion of the investigator, there was a reasonable possibility that the pyrexia and 
pain in extremity were related to the study intervention but not related to clinical trial procedures. The MAH 
concurred with the investigator’s causality assessment about pyrexia but assessed that the pain in extremity 
could reasonably be of muscular origin and related to the second dose of blinded study intervention but also 
be due to an unspecified viral infection. Assessment by the MAH is agreed. 
Status epilepticus and hypoglycaemia  
A participant with a pertinent medical history including e.g., Miller-Dieker syndrome and seizure, urinary tract 
infection (UTI), with several concomitant medications. The participant received Dose 1 BNT162b2 (3 µg) in 
Q2 2021. The participant developed status epilepticus (reported as SAE, Grade 3, 3 days duration), 17 days 
after receiving Dose 1. On Day 13, the participant was diagnosed with UTI, and treated with Levofloxacin. 
The participant initially improved, but after 48 hours  started to have sporadic episodes of severe pain, 
manifesting as crying and grimacing with an increase in seizures from baseline (5 to 10 times) to more than 
20 seizures during that time. On Day18, the participant’s highest recorded temperature was 99.3°F (37.4°C). 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/890761/2022 
Page 128/155 
 
 
Respiratory panel tests (incl. SARS-CoV-2) were negative. On Day 18, the participant was diagnosed with 
hypoglycaemia (reported as non-SAE, Grade 1) as well as seizures. On Day 19, the hypoglycaemia resolved, 
and on Day 20, the status epilepticus was considered resolved. On Day 22, a urine culture showed normal 
urogenital flora. The events of status epilepticus led to study withdrawal (Section discontinuation due to AEs) 
and the participant did not receive Dose 2. In the opinion of the investigator, there was no reasonable 
possibility that the status epilepticus was related to the study intervention or clinical trial procedures but was 
related to the UTI. The MAH concurred with the investigator’s causality assessment and stated that the status 
epilepticus was most likely due to hypoglycemia or a complication secondary to the intercurrent infectious 
condition and this assessment is agreed.  
Two unrelated SAEs of clinical interest (epilepsy, febrile convulsion) were reported in the BNT162b2 group: 
Epilepsy  
A participant with a pertinent family medical history of febrile seizures, received Dose 1 BNT162b2 (3 µg) in 
Q3 2021 and Dose 2 BNT162b2 (3 µg) on Day 21. The participant received influenza vaccine (Influvacc 
Tetra) on Day 65. The participant seizures reported as suspected epilepsy (SAE, Grade 3), 47 days after 
receiving Dose 2 and 3 days after receiving the influenza vaccine. On Day 68, the participant presented to 
the emergency department after experiencing a seizure, including an episode of vomiting, followed by 
trembling of the left hand, mimic movements of half of the face, and disturbed consciousness without 
fainting. The participant was hospitalized in good general condition. Laboratory test results showed 
thrombocyte platelet count 472 g/L (reference range [RR]: 150-420 g/L) and thyroid -stimulating hormone of 
6.3 IU/mL (RR: 0.4-6.0 IU/mL). During hospitalization, no symptoms were observed; a COVID-19 test result 
was negative. A computed tomography scan of the head revealed no signs of pathology, and 
electroencephalogram (EEG) results were not reported. The participant was treated with paracetamol and a 
solution for infusion, no further seizures were observed, the participant was discharged from the hospital on 
Day 70, and there were no seizures reported after the discharge. EEG performed while the participant was 
drowsy on Day 98 showed abnormal results. On Day 126, the neurologist verified the EEG result and 
reported that the diagnosis was still suspicion of epilepsy, since the seizure did not repeat. In the opinion of 
the investigator and MAH, there was no reasonable possibility that the epilepsy was related to the study 
intervention or clinical trial procedures, but it was suspected as being related to the influenza vaccine. Due to 
limited medical data and inconclusive EEG, epilepsy cannot be confirmed but the assessor agrees with the 
investigator and MAH that this reported SAE is, due to long time to onset after dose and that other 
concomitant factors were obvious, probably not related to study intervention. 
Febrile convulsions  
A participant with no pertinent medical history, was reported having a seizure during fever (39.3°C) that 
occurred 20 days after dose 1 BNT162b2 (3 µg) vaccine that lasted for 10 minutes (reported as febrile 
convulsions, SAE, Grade 2, resolved). Thereafter no new seizures and at revaccination with second dose no 
other AE/SAE was reported. Due to long time to onset after dose the assessor agrees that there was no 
reasonable possibility that the febrile convulsion was related to the study intervention. 
Furthermore, one case in the Placebo and thereafter crossover group receiving BNT162b2 (3 µg) vaccine 
after unblinding was reported with febrile convulsion. 
A participant with a pertinent medical history of a neurodevelopmental disorder for which prior febrile 
seizures occurred, received 2 doses of Placebo. The participant received the first crossover dose of BNT162b2 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/890761/2022 
Page 129/155 
 
 
on Day 157 and the second crossover dose of BNT162b2 on Day 177. The participant experienced a febrile 
convulsion (reported as non-SAE, grade 1), 1 day after receiving the second crossover dose of BNT162b2. 
The seizure lasted 2 minutes and the temperature of the participant was 38°C with no other symptoms or 
concomitant vaccinations reported. In the opinion of the investigator, there was a reasonable possibility that 
the febrile convulsion was related to BNT162b2. This participant had one episode of 2-minute-long convulsion 
during low fever. Since the fever was below 38.5 oC, it is not conclusive for febrile convulsions. It is possible 
that this participant, with a medical history of a neurodevelopmental disorder for which prior febrile seizures 
occurred, had a convulsion caused by low grade fever after vaccination and thereby no new safety concern 
detected.  
Appendicitis  
Two unrelated SAEs of clinical interest were reported in the BNT162b2 group: 
•  A participant who had SAEs of acute appendicitis (Grade 2) and localized peritonitis (Grade 1), both 
with onset 105 days post-Dose 2. 
•  A participant with no pertinent medical history was diagnosed with appendicitis, 11 days after 
receiving Dose 2 BNT162b2 (3 µg) reported as SAE, grade 3 and resolved. 
In the opinion of the investigator and MAH there was no reasonable possibility that the two cases of 
appendicitis were related to the study intervention, concomitant medications, or clinical trial procedures and 
this assessment is agreed by the assessor. Furthermore, after this event on Day 218 the latter participant 
received Dose 3 BNT162b2 (3 µg), and no AEs/SAEs reported after rechallenging.  
Viral gastroenteritis: 
One participant is described / in participants 2 to <5 Years of Age in the in the BNT162b2 (3 μg) group 
reported with viral gastroenteritis (reported as an SAE, Grade 3), 23 days after Dose 2 and resolved. This 
case was assessed by the investigator as unrelated to study intervention and related to viral infection. This 
assessment is agreed.

Phase 2/3 - 6 Months to <2 Years of Age 
Deaths  
No deaths were reported in the Phase 2/3 pediatric population of children 6 months to <2 years of age up to 
the data cutoff date. 
Serious Adverse Events from Dose 1 to Data Cutoff Date  
Few SAEs were reported during blinded follow-up in BNT162b2 3-μg (1.4%) and placebo (2.3%) groups from 
Dose 1 to the data cutoff date (Table below). 
Most SAEs were gastrointestinal or respiratory infections/illnesses, with no imbalance between groups.  
SAEs of potential clinical interest reported in the BNT162b2 group are further discussed below.  
A participant with a pertinent medical history of food allergy (mild perioral rash in response to nuts; now 
regularly eats nut following desensitization) was reported having an anaphylactoid reaction (reported as 
SAE, Grade 3) directly after eating nut. The participant had received dose 1 BNT162b2 (3 µg) 15 days before 
this event and was assessed as by the investigator and MAH as not related to the study intervention or 
clinical trial procedures but was considered related to a nut allergy, and this is agreed. 
A participant with no pertinent medical history, received Dose 1 BNT162b2 (3 µg) in Q1 2022 and Dose 2 
BNT162b2 (3 µg) on Day 55. The participant experienced a febrile convulsion (reported as SAE, Grade 2), 
fever (up to 40°C), 38 days after receiving Dose 1, and was admitted to the hospital. The febrile convulsion 
resolved without antiseizure medication. The participant’s physical examination on admission included good 
general condition, restlessness, and tiredness, with otherwise no abnormalities and otitis media was 
confirmed by a laryngologist. On Day 39 CRP was 10.6 mg/L (RR: 0-5 mg/L). In the opinion of the 
investigator, and MAH there was no reasonable possibility that the febrile convulsion was related to the study

intervention, concomitant medications, or clinical trial procedures. The assessor agrees based on long time to 
onset, other concomitant factors and at rechallenge no new AEs were reported.  
A participant with no pertinent medical history. Two days after receiving Dose 2, episodes of the participant’s 
eyes rolling back, along with an elevated temperature (38.0°C) and symptoms of a respiratory tract infection 
were noticed, and these symptoms were reported as seizure (SAE, grade 1). On Day 4, the participant was 
admitted to the hospital, eyeball turning upward once without deviations but otherwise the physical and 
neurological examinations, were normal. Laboratory test not conclusive for other diseases and brain 
ultrasound examination were normal. The participant was discharged and a few episodes per day of his eyes 
rolling back were noticed. Symptoms resolved on Day 42. The participant was withdrawn from the study 
because of an unblinding request. Summary of EEGs examinations at acute phase and follow up has been 
provided but are inconclusive for diagnosis of seizure. The participant was seen in the neurological clinic and 
the final diagnosis was convulsions, not elsewhere classified. In the opinion of the investigator and MAH, 
there was no reasonable possibility that the seizure was related to the study intervention or clinical trial 
procedures. 
According to the CHMP the symptoms are not conclusive for epilepsy, nor results from EEG. Furthermore, the 
follow-up EEG was normalized. The symptoms of eyes rolling back could have had other causes such as pain 
or gastroesophageal reflux. There were other concomitant symptoms such as respiratory tract infection and 
elevated temperature, however, the symptoms were not typical for seizures and temperature not above 
38.5°C and thereby the event cannot be assessed as febrile seizure. The assessment that there was no 
reasonable possibility that the seizure was related to the study intervention or clinical trial procedures, is 
agreed with the investigator and MAH. 
A participant had neutropenia (reported as non-SAE, Grade 3) of unknown etiology with onset 20 days 
post-Dose 2 of BNT162b2, resolved 36 days after onset, and considered by the investigator as not related to 
study intervention. This was reported after a routine screening with complete blood count conducted by her 
pediatrician. Clinical laboratory tests showed a white blood cell count of 3.2 x 103/μL (RR not specified) and 
ANC of 230 cells/μL (RR not specified). The participant was asymptomatic at the time with no fever, chills, 
oral lesions, diarrhea, cough, vomiting, or any other symptoms and no further diagnostic work-up was 
performed. 
The participant also had another SAE reported of viral gastroenteritis 30 days post-Dose 2 that resolved in 4 
days (reported as SAE, Grade 3); and considered by the investigator as not related to study intervention; this 
event is included in the SAE analysis. 
Further information is available that this participant is evaluated for potential ‘cyclical’ neutropenia due to an 
additional event reported after the submission cutoff date (hospitalization 166 days post-Dose 2 for RSV 
infection with clinical laboratory evidence of neutropenia). 
None of the events are considered by the investigator as not related to study intervention This assessment is 
agreed and the event of neutropenia could have been confounded by infection. It is noted that only whole 
blood cell count without definition of RR but this does not change the assessment. No new safety concern 
detected.  
SAEs of potential clinical interest reported in the placebo group included anaphylactic reaction 111 days post 
dose 1, severe cyanosis 5 days post dose 1, and viral bronchiolitis and pneumomediastinum 83 days post 
dose 2.

Phase 2/3 – 2-<5 Years of Age 
Among participants 2 to <5 years of age, AEs leading to withdrawal during blinded follow-up from Dose 1 to 
the data cutoff date (29 April 2022) were reported by 0.2% in the BNT162b2 group and 0.1% in the placebo 
group. These included events of pyrexia, status epilepticus, or urticaria reported by 1 participant each in the 
BNT162b2 group and swelling face/macular rash both reported by 1 participant in the placebo group. 
A participant and withdrew due to a nonserious (Grade 2) AE of pyrexia with onset 2 days post-Dose 1 and 
resolution in 5 days (recorded in the e-diary as a systemic event Section 5.2.3.1.1.2). The participant 
developed a temperature of 40.8°C 1 day after receiving Dose 1 BNT162b2 (3 μg) and reported as pyrexia, 
non-SAE, grade 2. No other reactogenicity symptoms were reported. On Day 3, the participant had a 
temperature of 40.7°C. On Day 4, the pyrexia continued with a temperature of 40.5°C and had mild fatigue. 
On Day 5, the temperature was 38.4°C and the mild fatigue continued. On Day 5; SARS-CoV-2 PCR, was 
negative. On Day 6, the pyrexia resolved and considered by the investigator as related to vaccine and 
agreed.  
A participant and withdrew due to an event of status epilepticus 18 days post-Dose 1 that was reported as 
an unrelated SAE (section SAE). 
A participant who experienced urticaria (reported as non-SAE, grade 1), specifically pruritic maculopapular 
rash located on the chest, back of thighs, and arms, 1 day after receiving Dose 1. On Day 5, the urticaria 
resolved. In the opinion of the investigator, there was a reasonable possibility that the urticaria was related 
to the study intervention leading to withdrawal. Urticaria described as a rare event in the SmPC. 
The following subject did not receive dose 3, since withdrawal was requested by the parent(s)/legal guardian: 
This concerns a participant who received Dose 1 BNT162b2 (3 µg) in Q3 2021 and Dose 2 BNT162b2 (3 µg) 
on Day 23, who was diagnosed with bilateral deafness (reported as non-SAE, Grade 3) during a primary 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/890761/2022 
Page 135/155 
 
 
 
care audiometric evaluation in Q3 2021 (exact day not reported). The bilateral deafness resolved after 
tympanostomy tube placement on Day 92. The participant’s parent(s)/legal guardian requested withdrawal 
from the study. In the opinion of the investigator, there was no reasonable possibility that the bilateral 
deafness was related to the study intervention. 
In the placebo group, 1 participant had a nonserious AE of swelling face and macular rash 1-day post-Dose 
1 that resolved the same day, leading to withdrawal from vaccination.  
Phase 2/3 – 6 Months to <2 years of Age 
Three AEs leading to withdrawal were reported during blinded follow-up from Dose 1 to the data cutoff date 
(29 April 2022), all in theBNT162b2 group; these include 2 cases of pyrexia and one case of rash, all 
considered by the investigator as related to study intervention. 
Two participants in the BNT162b2 group were withdrawn due to events of pyrexia (>40 °C), which were both 
also recorded in the e-diary as a systemic event and considered by the investigator as related to study 
intervention. Both cases reported as pyrexia had concomitant causality factors. Nevertheless, pyrexia is 
already described in the SmPC and thereby no new safety concern detected.  
One participant with previous history of eczema developed generalized rash 6 days after Dose 1 which 
resolved after 3 days. The participant discontinued from study intervention but remained in the study and 
Dose 2 was administered on Day 268. Rash is already included in section 4.8 of the product information.  
2.5.6.  Discussion on clinical safety 
This report concerns interim data for participants included the two age groups 6 months to <2 years and 2-
<5 years in study C4591007. Safety data from the Phase 1 studies where the two doses of 3µg (n=16) and 
10µg (n=32) was evaluated in children aged 2-<5 years and two doses of 3µg dose (n=16) was evaluated in 
children aged 6 months to <2 years. The main safety data base constitutes of two Phase 2/3 studies where 
three doses of either 3µg BNT162b2 or placebo was administered. The age group 2-<5 years included 2,750 
subjects (3µg n=1,835; placebo n=915) and the age group 6 months to<2 years included 1,776 subjects 
(3µg n=1,178; placebo n=598). Reactogenicity was recorded daily for 7 days after each dose by using e-
diary. AEs were collected from Dose 1 through 1 month after Dose 2 and from Dose 3 through 1 month after 
Dose 3, and serious AEs (SAEs) were collected from Dose 1 through 6 months after Dose 3. In both groups 
>99% received dose1 and 2, and dose 3 had been administered to 32-33% of the subjects in both age 
groups at the cutoff date (29APR2022). 
Reactogenicity 
The results from the Phase 1 study suggest that the selected dose of 3µg is associated with a clearly lower 
frequency of both local and systemic reactions compared to a dose of 10µg among children aged 2 - <5 
years. In the phase 1 study for children aged 6 months to <2 years where only 3µg was administered, the 
results do not suggest another reactogenicity profile to what was seen in children 2-<5 years.  
In the Phase 2/3 study, children aged 2 - <5 years were randomized to receive three doses of either 3µg 
BNT162b2 (n=1832) or placebo (n=915). Pain at injection site was the most common local reaction, reported 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/890761/2022 
Page 136/155 
 
 
at a higher frequency in the 3µg BNT162b2 group (dose1 31%; dose2 31%; dose3 27%) compared to 
placebo group (dose1 21%; dose2 20%; dose3 13%). The difference between the two groups were smaller 
for redness (9-11% vs 3-9%) and swelling (3-6% vs 1-3%), and the frequency was overall lower for dose 3 
compared to the first two doses. 
Fatigue was the most common systemic event, reported at an almost similar frequency in the 3µg BNT162b2 
group (dose1 30%; dose2 26%; dose3 25%) and in the placebo group (dose1 31%; dose2 23%; dose3 
22%). Fever was reported at a similar frequency between the two groups (5% vs 4-5%). Fever 38.9oC to 
40oC was reported by ≤1.1% in both groups after each of the three doses.  Three participants, all in the 
BNT162b2 group, reported a fever >40.0oC after Dose 1 or Dose 2. No other differences in terms of systemic 
events were noted between the groups and the use of antipyretic/pain medication was also similar (9-11% vs 
7-10%).  
In the Phase 2/3 study children aged 6 months to <2 years of age were randomized to receive three doses 
of either 3µg BNT162b2 (n=1178) or placebo (n=598). Pain at injection site was the most common local 
reaction, reported at a higher frequency in the 3µg BNT162b2 group (dose1 17%; dose2 15%; dose3 16%) 
compared to placebo group (dose1 11%; dose2 9%; dose3 12%). The difference between the two groups 
were smaller for redness (7-11% vs 5-7%) and swelling (3-4% vs 2-3%).  
Irritability was the most common systemic event, reported at almost similar frequency in the 3µg BNT162b2 
group (dose1 51%; dose2 47%; dose3 44%) and in the placebo group (dose1 47%; dose2 41%; dose3 
38%). Fever was reported at a similar frequency between the two groups (7% vs 6-7%), and fever 38.9oC to 
40oC was reported by ≤2.0% of participants in the BNT162b2 group and ≤1.2% in the placebo group, after 
each of the three doses. Three participants in the BNT162b2 group reported a fever >40.0oC (n=1 each post-
Dose 1, Dose 2, Dose 3), two of whom had a concurrent viral infection (roseola or unknown). Drowsiness was 
reported in 20-27% in the 3µg BNT162b2 group vs 13-30% in the placebo group. Decreased appetite was 
reported in 20-22% in the 3µg BNT162b2 group and in 14-21% in the placebo group. For both drowsiness 
and decreased appetite, the lowest frequency reported after dose 3. Use of antipyretic/pain medication was 
reported in 20-24% vs 17-20% in both groups, the lowest frequency was reported after dose 3. It is noted 
that drowsiness was reported at a frequency of >20%, which is not reflected in the SmPC. Therefore, 
applicant was asked to update the SmPC section 4.8 accordingly. 
In the Phase 2/3 studies, no Grade 4 local or systemic reactions were reported after any dose, and the 
subgroup analysis did not show any clinically meaningful differences in terms of sex, race, ethnicity or 
baseline SARS-CoV-2 status. 
Overall, the reactogenicity profile in the Phase 2/3 studies seems acceptable for children aged 6 months-<5 
years, it was noted that for several of the systemic events, a similar frequency events were reported for the 
vaccine and the placebo group. There was no clear difference in reactogenicity profile between the three 
administered doses. It is however noted that only 30% of the subjects had received dose 3 at cutoff date. 
AEs 
From Dose 1 to the data cutoff date (29 April 2022), the proportions of participants 2 to <5 years of age 
with any AE were similar in the 3µg BNT162b2 (18.8%) and placebo (18.9%) groups. To events already 
reported up to 1 month after Dose 3, a limited number of additional events were reported up to the data 
cutoff date. Many of the AEs were consistent with reactogenicity events (e.g., vomiting, pyrexia, and fatigue). 
Overall, most of the additional AEs reported after 1-month post-Dose 3 up to the data cutoff date consisted 
of unrelated viral infections, fevers, and other minor illnesses and injuries typical for this age group in the 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation

general paediatric population. In the general disorders and administration site conditions SOC, AEs were 
reported at numerically higher incidence in the BNT162b2 group than the placebo group (4.3% vs 3.9%), 
largely attributable to injection site reactions and fatigue. 
Few SAEs were reported among participants 2 to <5 years of age during blinded placebo-controlled follow-up 
in BNT162b2 3-μg (0.7%) and placebo (0.9%) groups from Dose 1 to the data cutoff date. Most SAEs were 
gastrointestinal or respiratory infections/illnesses, with no imbalance between groups. Most of the events 
considered as severe were unrelated SAEs. No life-threatening (i.e., Grade 4) AEs were reported from Dose 1 
to 1 month after Dose 3. 
Two SAEs reported by the same participant in the BNT162b2 group were considered by the investigator as 
related to study intervention, which included pyrexia accompanied by viral exanthem after receiving the 
second dose. 
One participant with pertinent medical history including seizure, was reported with SAEs of status epilepticus 
17 days after receiving Dose 1 of BNT162b probably due to a urinary tract infection and hypoglycemia. 
Two unrelated SAEs of epilepsy and febrile convulsion, 47 days after receiving Dose 2 and 3 days after 
receiving the influenza vaccine, were reported. 
One case of 10 min seizure during fever (39.3°C) 20 days after dose 1 of 3µg BNT162b2. was reported. Two 
unrelated SAEs of appendicitis were reported in the BNT162b2 group. 
From Dose 1 to the data cutoff date, the proportions of participants in the 6 months to <2 years of age 
group reported at least one AE were similar in the BNT162b2 (30.3%) and placebo (27.3%) groups. In 
addition to events already reported up to 1 month after Dose 3, a limited number of additional events were 
reported up to the data cutoff date. Many of the AEs were consistent with reactogenicity events that were 
reported as AEs (e.g., vomiting, diarrhea, and pyrexia). 
Few SAEs were reported among subjects aged 6 months to <2 years during blinded follow-up BNT162b2 3-μg 
(1.4%) and placebo (2.3%) groups from Dose 1 to the data cutoff date. Most severe AEs were 
gastrointestinal or respiratory infections/illnesses reported as unrelated SAEs, with no imbalance between 
groups. One life-threatening (i.e., Grade 4) AE was reported from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 3, by a 
participant in the placebo group who had a thermal burn that was reported as an SAE. 
One SAE of anaphylactoid reaction was reported directly after eating nut, the first dose of BNT162b2 was 
received 15 days before. One case of neutropenia (reported as non-SAE, Grade 3) and viral gastroenteritis 
was reported 30 days post-Dose 2. 
One case of febrile convulsion was reported 38 days after receiving Dose 1. One SAE of seizure (Grade 1) 
was reported 3 days post-Dose 2 and resolved 17 days later.  These cases were assessed by the CHMP as not 
related to study vaccine. 
In total three participants in the BNT162b2 group and none in the placebo group reported lymphadenopathy. 
Lymphadenopathy is already included in section 4,8 of the product information. 
AEs of clinical interest, such as the CDC's list of AESIs for COVID-19, which both include terms potentially 
indicative of severe COVID-19 or serious autoimmune and neuroinflammatory disorders, were considered in 
the review of reported events. Up to the cut-off no cases of myocarditis/pericarditis, Kawasaki disease,

Page 138/155 
 
 
 
peripheral neuropathy, MIS-C, autoimmune or demyelination events Bell’s palsy/facial paralysis/facial paresis 
was reported in the two groups included in the Phase 2/3 study. 
The rate of subjects discontinuing the study due to AE was low in both age groups. Three subjects in the 
BNT162 arm 2 to <5 years of age discontinued due to AEs or SAEs (pyrexia, status epilepticus, or urticaria), 
and three subjects 6 months to <2 years in the BNT162b2 discontinued due to AEs (pyrexia, rash). 
Overall, in both age groups most of the reported AEs were either related to the reactogenicity of vaccination 
or events that would be expected in a general population of healthy children in these age groups respectively. 
No imbalance between the vaccine and placebo groups was noted. Furthermore, SAEs occurred at a very low 
frequency in both placebo and vaccine arm in both study age groups.  
The study size did not allow detection of rare adverse events, or to evaluate whether the characteristics of 
identified, but rarer risks differ compared with the adolescent and adult populations. 
There are still limited data available on interaction with other vaccines given concomitantly (missing 
information), and limited data regarding long term safety (missing information). 
2.5.7.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety evaluation is mainly based on the still ongoing Phase 2/3 study that at the cutoff (29APR2022) 
included 2,750 subjects (3µg n=1,835; placebo n=915) aged 2-<5 years of age and 1,776 subjects (3µg 
n=1,178; placebo n=598) aged 6 months to <2 months of age.  
Overall, the reactogenicity profile are in line with what can be anticipated from a vaccine with mostly mild to 
moderate reaction. For several of the systemic reaction, a similar frequency was reported in both the vaccine 
and the placebo group. 
The frequency of reported AEs and SAEs were low. The observed adverse reactions have been included in the 
SmPC.

2.6.4.  Conclusion 
The CHMP considered that the risk management plan version 8.0 is acceptable.  
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.7.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the MAH fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.7.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
A user consultation with target patient groups on the package information leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Comirnaty 30 micrograms/dose concentrate for  
dispersion for injection, EMEA/H/C/005735.  The bridging report submitted by the applicant has been found 
acceptable. 
2.8.2.  Labelling exemptions  
The following exemptions from labelling requirements have been granted on the basis of article 63.3 of 
Directive 2001/83/EC. In addition, the derogations granted should be seen in the context of the flexibilities 
described in the Questions and Answers on labelling flexibilities for COVID-19 vaccines (EMA/689080/2020 
rev.1, from 16 December 2020)5 document which aims at facilitating the preparedness work of COVID-19 
vaccine developers and the associated logistics of early printing packaging activities. The ultimate goal is to 
facilitate the large scale and rapid deployment of COVID19 vaccines for EU citizens within the existing legal 
framework.  
Labelling exemptions 
Outer and immediate labelling (from start of supply to end February 2023). 
The following exemptions are temporarily agreed for the labelling. These exemptions are justified on the 
necessity to label batches ahead of time.

o  MA number with ‘XXX’ placeholder, instead of MA number will be used after approval. 
2.8.3.  Quick Response (QR) code 
The review of the QR code request submitted by the MAH is discussed separately with the QRD group and is 
based on previous discussions and assessment for other Comirnaty presentations.   
2.8.4.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Comirnaty (tozinameran) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as New active substance and new biological. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which appeared in 
the Wuhan province in China in 2019 and has spread world-wide during 2020 ever since, causing WHO to 
declare a pandemic on 11 March 2020. The virus infects primarily the airways and causes a broad spectrum 
of respiratory infections from asymptomatic infection to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).  
COVID-19 in children is mostly a mild disease. Severe cases occur rarely, and predominantly in subjects with 
underlying conditions. The Applicant is seeking an indication for Comirnaty (BNT162b2) 3 µg formulation to 
children 6 months to <5 years of age. 
COVID-19 is mostly a mild disease in children although severe cases rarely occur, predominantly in subjects 
with underlying conditions. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There are currently no vaccines against COVID-19 approved in EU for the use in children below 5 years of 
age. 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/890761/2022 
Page 148/155 
 
 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The application is based on a placebo-controlled, observer-blinded study in children 6 Months to <5 Years of 
Age. Participants were randomized 2:1 to receive vaccine or placebo at sites in the US, Finland, Poland, 
Spain, and Brazil. 
The applicant selected to develop 3-dose regimen, since a two-dose regimen showed inferior immunogenicity 
in the 2-5 years old stratum, compared to young adults. 
There was approximately 21-day interval between dose 1 and dose 2, and at least 8 weeks between dose 2 
and dose 3.  
The primary endpoint was non-inferior immunogenicity 1 month after dose three, in two strata, 6 months-2 
year, and 2-5 years. The reference for non-inferiority was neutralizing titres 1 month after dose 2 in 
participants 16 to 25 years of age from Phase 2/3 of the C4591001 study, who had received 2 doses of 
BNT162b2 (30 μg) with 21-day interval. 
Vaccine efficacy was de facto managed as an exploratory endpoint: confirmed COVID-19 incidence from 7 
days after Dose 3 per 1000 person-years of blinded follow-up. 
The main safety data base constitutes of two Phase 2/3 studies where three doses of either 3µg BNT162b2 or 
placebo was administered. The age group 2-<5 years included 2,750 subjects (3µg n=1,835; placebo n=915) 
and the age group 6 months to<2 years included 1,776 subjects (3µg n=1,178; placebo n=598). 
Reactogenicity was recorded daily for 7 days after each dose by using e-diary. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Among participants in the evaluable immunogenicity population without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 
infection, the GMR of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers in children 2 to <5 years of age (at 1-month post-
Dose 3 of BNT162b2 3-µg) compared to young adults 16 to 25 years of age (at 1-month post-Dose 2 of 
BNT162b2 30-µg) was 1.30 (2-sided 95% CI: 1.13, 1.50). GMR in children 6 months to <2 years of age 
compared to young adults was 1.19 (2-sided 95% CI: 1.00, 1.42). 
As the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for GMR was >0.67 and the GMR point estimate was >0.8 
(protocol specified criterion) and >1.0 (requested by FDA), indicating the prespecified immunobridging 
success criterion for the GMR was met for both age groups 6 months to <2 years and 2 to <5 years old.  
Almost equal proportions (100 % each of children 2- <5 years of age and 6m-<2 yo and 99% young adults 
16 to 25 years of age) of participants achieved a seroresponse. The difference in the proportions of 
participants who had seroresponse between the 2 age groups (children – young adults) was 1.2% (2-sided 
95% CI: -1.5%, 4.2% for 2- <5 yo and -3.4%, 4.2% for 6m-<2 yo). The lower limit of the 95% CI for the 
difference in seroresponse rate were -1.5% and -3.4%, which is greater than the prespecified margin of -
10%. Therefore, immunobridging based on seroresponse rate was achieved. The difference of the 
seroresponse rate in children 6 months to <5 years of age compared to young adults was 1.2% (2-sided 
95% CI: -0.5%, 4.2%. 
In support of the immunobridging a preliminary analysis of efficacy was submitted with cut-off date 
29.04.2022 and was updated along the procedure 
Among participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection before or during the vaccination regimen, 
the observed VE for BNT162b2 3 µg against any confirmed COVID-19  from at least 7 days after Dose 3 was 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/890761/2022 
Page 149/155 
 
 
80.3% (2-sided 95% CI: 13.9%, 96.7%) which included 3 cases in the BNT162b2 group and 7 cases in the 
placebo group. All these post-Dose 3 cases were reported in February through April 2022, when Omicron 
BA1. was most prevalent circulating strain in USA.   
The MAH submitted an updated VE analysis with cut-off date 17.06.2022. The median follow-up time for 
entire cohort, from 6 months to <5 year old children was 2.2 months. Among participants without prior 
evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection before or during the vaccination regimen, the observed VE for BNT162b2 3 
µg against any confirmed COVID-19  from at least 7 days after Dose 3 was 73.2% (2-sided 95% CI: 43.8%, 
87.6%) which included 13 cases in the BNT162b2 group (N=873) and 21 cases in the placebo group 
(N=381). All cases, expect one which was undefined, were caused by Omicron strain. The most common 
were Omicron BA.2 and Omicron BA.2.12.1. 
There were 8 severe cases of COVID-19 in age group 6m-<5-year-old in active arm after 2-doses, whereas in 
placebo arm 4 severe case appeared. Notably, none of the cases showed clinical signs that would suggest 
VAERD. 
A  descriptive  immunogenicity  analysis  of  Omicron  neutralizing  titers  was  conducted  using  the  FFRNT 
unvalidated  assay,  to  compare  children  (2  to  <5Y)  with  adults  (18  to  50Y)  who  received  a  third  dose  of 
BNT162b2 at a similar interval between Dose 2 and Dose 3. Results showed the Omicron specific neutralization 
titers are very similar across pediatric population (GMT 128.8 and 114.3 respectively in children 6 months to 
<2 years and 2 to <5 years) and an 18 to 50 years adult comparator group (GMT 164.2) for whom high efficacy 
was observed. 
No MIS-C were reported in the 6 months to <5 years of age group, per protocol definition or per CDC 
definition. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The duration of protection in the target population is unknown. Indeed, the median duration of blinded 
follow-up for after Dose 3 was only 1.4 months. 
The efficacy against Omicron BA.5 has not been studied. 
Vaccine efficacy in special groups among children, such as immunocompromised or those at high-risk of 
severe disease were not assessed. A study in immunocompromised children is included in the PIP. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The main safety data of Comirnaty 3µg in children 6 months to <5 years of age has been evaluated in a still 
ongoing Phase 2/3 study (C4591007); the study includes two safety groups based on age. The group of 
children 6 months to-<2 years constitutes of 1,776 subjects (3µg n=1,178; placebo n=598), and the group 
of children aged 2-<5 years included 2,750 subjects (3µg n=1,835; placebo n=915). The cutoff date is 29 
April 2022. 
Among the children aged 2-<5 years, pain at injection site was the most common local reaction, reported at 
a higher frequency in the 3µg BNT162b2 group (dose1 31%; dose2 31%; dose3 27%) compared to placebo 
group (dose1 21%; dose2 20%; dose3 13%).  
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/890761/2022 
Page 150/155 
 
 
Fatigue was the most common systemic event, reported at an almost similar frequency in the 3µg BNT162b2 
group (dose1 30%; dose2 26%; dose3 25%) and in the placebo group (dose1 31%; dose2 23%; dose3 
22%).  
Fever was reported at a similar frequency between the two groups (5% vs 4-5%). Fever 38.9oC to 40oC was 
reported by ≤1.1% in both groups after each of the three doses.  
No other differences in terms of systemic events were noted between the groups and the use of 
antipyretic/pain medication was also similar (9-11% vs 7-10%). 
Among the children aged 6 months to <2 years, tenderness at injection site was the most common local 
reaction, reported at a higher frequency in the 3µg BNT162b2 group (dose1 17%; dose2 15%; dose3 16%) 
compared to placebo group (dose1 11%; dose2 9%; dose3 12%).  
Irritability was the most common systemic event, reported at almost similar frequency in the 3µg BNT162b2 
group (dose1 51%; dose2 47%; dose3 44%) and in the placebo group (dose1 47%; dose2 41%; dose3 
38%).  
Fever was reported at a similar frequency between the two groups (7% vs 6-7%), and fever 38.9oC to 40oC 
was reported by ≤2.0% of participants in the BNT162b2 group and ≤1.2% in the placebo group, after each of 
the three doses. 
Most of the local and systemic events resolved within two days and were mild to moderate at intensity.  
The frequency of AEs and SAEs was in general low and no new safety concerns have been detected compared 
to what was reported for the adolescent and adult population. No cases of myocarditis or pericarditis were 
observed. 
Among the children aged 6 months to <2 years, Drowsiness was also frequently reported after administration 
of BNT162b2 3µg vaccine. Therefore, such information is reflected in the adverse reaction table in section 4.8 
of the SmPC. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The present study size does not allow for the characterisation of less common child-specific risks, or if the 
magnitudes of identified but rarer risks differ compared with higher age groups. 
There are limited data available on interaction with other vaccines given concomitantly.

3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
There are currently no vaccines against COVID-19 approved in EU for the use in children below 5 years of 
age. The benefit of the vaccine in this age group is protection against symptomatic Covid-19. The known 
unfavourable effects are considered acceptable in terms of reactogenicity. No cases of myocarditis were 
observed in clinical trial. There are no new safety concerns based on the study conducted; however, the 
study size did not allow detection of rare adverse events, or to evaluate whether the characteristics of such 
identified. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The favourable effects outweigh the unfavourable effects for Comirnaty 3µg in the sought indication. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit /risk balance of Comirnaty 0.1 mg/ml is positive, subject to the conditions stated in the 
“Recommendations” section  
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of, COMIRNATY 0.1 mg/mL, is favourable in the following indication: 
Comirnaty 3 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is indicated for active immunisation to 
prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, in infants and children aged 6 months to 4 years. 
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.

extension of indication. 
This application concerns the following medicinal product: 
Medicinal product: 
International non-proprietary name: 
Presentations: 
Roactemra 
tocilizumab 
See Annex A 
The following variation was requested: 
Variation(s) requested 
Type 
C.1.6 a) 
Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
II 
The MAH applied for an update of sections 4.1 and 5.1 of the SmPC and consequential changes to 
section 1 of the Package Leaflet in order to extend the indication to the treatment in combination with 
methotrexate (MTX) of severe, active and progressive RA in adults not previously treated with MTX. In 
addition the MAH took the opportunity to align the PI with version 9 of the QRD template and to 
correct some typographical errors throughout the PI. 
The variation proposed amendments to the SmPC, Annex II and Package Leaflet. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0185/201 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0179/2012 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
About the disease 
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a progressive, systemic autoimmune disease characterised by synovitis 
that damages diarthroidal joints and is accompanied by fatigue, anaemia, and osteopenia. RA has a 
prevalence of 0.5% to 1.0% and a peak incidence between 40 and 60 years of age and affects 
primarily women.  
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) provide only symptomatic relief. Disease-modifying 
anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) maintain or improve physical function and retard radiographic joint 
damage. More recently, biologic compounds that target tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), B cells, 
or T cells have been used successfully to treat RA, but approximately 30% to 40% of patients fail to 
respond to these therapies. 
RoActemra 
EMA/431298/2014 
Page 5/115 
  
 
 
 
 
It is now accepted that there is a ‘window of opportunity’ within the early stages of RA during which 
there is a therapeutic opportunity to maximize disease retardation in terms of controlling symptoms, 
limiting joint damage, and improving physical function (Sesin & Bingham 2005; Cush 2007). Disease 
remission for patients with early RA and low disease activity for patients with long disease duration, 
are today’s accepted treatment goals. 
About the product 
Tocilizumab (RoActemra, TCZ) is a recombinant, humanized antihuman interleukin (IL)-6 receptor 
monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors, 
thereby inhibiting IL-6-mediated signalling. 
IL-6 is a pleiotropic, pro-inflammatory, multifunctional cytokine produced by a variety of cell types, 
and it has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, 
including RA. Elevated IL-6 levels have been observed in the serum and synovial fluid of RA patients, 
and levels correlate with disease activity. 
In the European Union (EU), RoActemra, in combination with MTX, is indicated for the treatment of 
moderate to severe active RA in adult patients who have either responded inadequately to, or who 
were intolerant to, previous therapy with one or more disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs 
(DMARDs) or tumor necrosis factor α antagonists. In these patients, RoActemra can be given as 
monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or where continued treatment with MTX is inappropriate. 
The recommended posology for adult RA in the EU is 8 mg/kg body weight, given as an intravenous 
(IV) infusion once every four weeks.  
The development program/Compliance with CHMP Guidance/Scientific Advice 
The CHMP Scientific Advice was not obtained prior to the initiation of study WA19924. 
GCP 
The WA19926 study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) guidelines or with the laws of the country if these afforded greater protection of 
subjects, as declared by the MAH. 
Type of application and other comments on the submitted dossier 
This Type II variation is to extend the adult indication for RoActemra to include the following: the 
treatment of severe, active and progressive RA in adults not previously treated with MTX. In addition, 
the MAH proposed to amend the indication statement regarding the joint damage to the following: 
RoActemra has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray 
and to improve physical function when given alone or in combination with methotrexate. 
This variation application is based on the results of the Week-52 analysis of the pivotal Phase III trial, 
WA19926 (FUNCTION). Supporting data is provided from previous phase III studies and from long 
term extension studies. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Table 1.  Tabular overview of key clinical studies of tocilizumab in patients with RA 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No separate PK/PD study was conducted. PK/PD and immunogenicity parameters were measured in the 
pivotal study and summarized descriptively. Given the reduced set of PK data available from the 
pivotal study, which did not allow analysis of detailed aspects of the PK, in the Assessment focus is 
given on the PK in the target population. The derived PK data were compared with historical data.

No changes to the SmPC section 5.2 (Pharmakokinetic properties) were proposed with this variation 
application. Thus the submitted information was intended to support the assumption of a comparable 
PK profile for MTX naïve RA patients and the previously approved indication of RA patients. 
Analytical methods 
Pivotal study WA19926 (FUNCTION): The bioanalytical reports for TCZ concentration, IL-6 
concentration, sIL-6R concentration, and screening as well as confirmed positive anti-TCZ antibody 
assay were provided. 
The concentrations of interleukin-6 soluble receptor (IL-6 sR) were determined in human serum 
according to a validated quantitative solid phase sandwich ELISA designed to measure IL-6 sR in cell 
culture supernatant, serum, plasma and urine. The concentrations of IL-6 sR were determined 
successfully in a total of 3728 out of 3755 human serum samples obtained from clinical study 
WA19926. The study was not GLP conform. The lower limit of quantification was 12.5 ng/mL in native 
serum. The calibration range was 0.0313 – 2.00 ng/mL (concentrations in assay), equivalent to 12.5 – 
800 ng/mL in native serum. Aliquots of 10.0 μL of serum were used. The precision of the assay as 
ranged from 8.5% to 9.2%. The accuracy of the assay was between 99.7% and 102.2%. 
The concentrations of neutralizing anti-TCZ antibodies were determined in human serum according to 
the validated ELISA method in a total of 121 human serum samples obtained from clinical study 
WA19926. Anti-TCZ antibodies were analysed using aliquots of 40.0 μL of serum. The quality of 
determinations was satisfactory throughout the study. The lower limit of quantification for anti-TCZ 
antibodies was 211 ng-eq./mL (concentration in serum) with an analytical range of 21.1 – 240 ng-
eq./mL (concentrations in assay), equivalent to 211 – 2400 ng-eq./mL in native serum. The precision 
of the assay as determined from the analysis of quality control samples ranged from 8.2% to 14.4%. 
The accuracy of the assay was between 91.4% and 101.4%. 
Test samples for anti-TCZ antibodies were analysed initially using a validated bridging ELISA method 
(Screening assay). In serum samples found positive in the Screening Assay, the presence of specific 
anti-TCZ antibodies was confirmed or excluded using the same ELISA method with an appropriate 
immunodepletion step (addition of excess Tocilizumab). Samples were confirmed as containing specific 
anti-Tocilizumab antibodies if the mean assay response of the matching control sample was above the 
plate specific cut point and the mean assay response of the confirmation sample was less than 80% of 
the control sample or in case the response of the aliquot measured with excess TCZ dropped below the 
plate-specific cut point. A total of 2416 human serum samples obtained from clinical study WA19926 
were screened for the presence of anti-Tocilizumab antibodies. For 2413 samples valid results were 
obtained for the anti-TCZ antibody screening assay. For one sample (subject 13200, sample 104) the 
initial results was invalid and the remaining volume was insufficient for analysis. Therefore, for this 
sample NOR was reported. For two samples (subject 16450, sample 104 and subject 12137, sample 
174) insufficient volume for analysis was provided and for these samples NOS were reported. In this 
study 325 out of 2416 human serum samples screened for the presence of anti-Tocilizumab antibodies 
were positive in the screening assay. 118 samples were confirmed positive for the presence of anti- 
Tocilizumab antibodies in the confirmatory assay.

Table 2.  Anti-TCZ antibody screening and confirmatory assay 
In the placebo-controlled IV TCZ studies in the DMARD-IR population and the IV TCZ LTE studies 
commercially obtained sera from RA patients were used to generate the cut point. For Study WA19926, 
the immunogenicity assay methods were essentially the same with the following modification: the cut 
point used to define anti-TCZ antibody positivity was generated from baseline samples of the study 
population. Samples were initially evaluated using a cut point established from healthy volunteers; 
these were later re-evaluated using the cut point generated from the study patients’ ADA values at 
baseline. This method corresponds to guidelines for immunogenicity testing 
[EMA/CHMP/BMWP/86289/2010 Guidance]. Screening and confirmation assay results presented below 
are based on the re-evaluation, including the results for patients who were positive for neutralizing 
antibody in samples that were ADA positive in the initial evaluation. 
In Study WA19926, all patients had samples collected for anti-TCZ antibody testing at baseline, Week 
52, and study exit, either prematurely or at the termination visit as per protocol. Blood samples, for 
patients who withdrew from the study due to events related to infusion reactions, were to be obtained 
at the time of the event and at least 6 weeks after the last infusion.  
Methods of pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Pivotal study WA199226 
All PK/PD parameters were summarized descriptively on the basis of the PK-evaluable population. All 
study treatment groups were summarized in the PD summaries; however, in PK and PK-PD summaries, 
only those patients randomized to one of the TCZ treatment groups were included. 
Patient’s Cwk2 (μg/mL), Cmin (μg/mL), and Cmax (μg/mL) were provided. Cwk2 is the serum 
concentration at Day 14 after dosing in Week 2. Cmax is the maximum observed plasma concentration 
immediately at the end of the infusion at Weeks 1 and 12. Cmin is the pre-dose concentration at Weeks 
4, 12, 16, 24, 36, 52, 76, and 104. AUC was not determined based on observed data due to the limited 
number of PK samples taken from each patient. 
Summaries were also repeated for the following subgroups:  
•  DAS28 remission response status at Week 24 (responder, nonresponder)  
•  DAS28 remission response status at Week 52 (responder, nonresponder)  
•  mTSS progression at Week 52 (progressor, non-progressor) 
Listings were repeated for the following subgroups: 
• 
• 
Patients with positive anti-TCZ antibody (human anti-human antibody) for screening, confirmative, 
and neutralizing assay result at Week 52 
Patients with positive anti-TCZ antibody for screening, confirmative, and neutralizing assay result

• 
Patients who experienced a hypersensitivity that led to study withdrawal, with the results of anti-
TCZ antibody assay testing taken at time of the event and at least 6 weeks after the 
hypersensitivity 
Scatter plots were produced for DAS28 score versus Cmin at Week 24 and mTSS versus Cmin at Week 
52. The PD parameters IL-6 and sIL-6R were summarized descriptively by visit (actual results and 
change from baseline results). 
PK Comparison of pivotal study WA19926 with historical data  
Graphical comparison of PK and PD results (4 mg/kg TCZ + MTX, 8 mg/kg TCZ + MTX) with Studies 
WA17822 (OPTION) and WA17823 (LITHE), which supported the initial RA filing, was provided. As the 
duration of WA17822 was only 24 weeks, PK-PD data from WA17823 will be the focus of such 
comparisons.  
Additionally, comparison of 8 mg/kg TCZ monotherapy PK data with MRA012JP (SAMURAI) and 
WA17824 (AMBITION), and Comparison of 8 mg/kg TCZ + MTX PK data with that predicted from a 
prior population PK analysis based on results from four of the above studies (WA17822, WA17824, 
WA18062, and WA18063 [OPTION, AMBITION, RADIATE, TOWARD]) was provided. 
Prior population PK analysis [Population PK Report No. 1031075]  
This report was based on data from four of the pivotal Phase III studies supporting the initial filing 
(WA17822, WA17824, WA18062, and WA18063 [OPTION, AMBITION, RADIATE, TOWARD]). It should 
be noted that the population PK analysis included data from patients receiving TCZ both alone and in 
combination with MTX; however as part of the same analysis, MTX was not shown to have any impact 
on TCZ PK. This Population PK analysis, which is used for historical comparison, has previously been 
assessed in the context of the initial MAA. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Pivotal study WA19926 (FUNCTION)  
This study was a four-arm, double-blinded, double-dummy, randomized, parallel-group, pivotal Phase 
III study comparing treatment with TCZ (either in combination with MTX or as monotherapy) to MTX 
monotherapy. The study population consisted of patients with early, moderate to severe RA of less 
than 2 years duration who were naïve to treatment with both MTX and a biologic agent. Of the 1846 
patients screened 1162 patients were randomized to treatment. Five patients withdrew prior to 
receiving any study treatment. Clinical pharmacology information from patients who completed 52 
weeks (1 year) of treatment or withdrew prematurely from WA19926 is presented. 
The pharmacokinetic-evaluable population included all patients who received at least one TCZ/placebo 
infusion and had at least one PK sample taken at any time during the study (up to Week 52 for the 
Week 52 data cut). 
Pre-dose TCZ levels were measured at baseline and Weeks 4, 12, 16, 24, 36, and 52. Two samples 
were taken at the baseline and Week 12 visits; the first before dosing and the second immediately at 
the end of the TCZ/placebo infusion. An additional post-dose sample was taken at Week 2 (Day 14), 
representing a middosing interval sample after first dose. 
Key findings – PK profile 
Mean TCZ pre-dose concentrations appeared to stabilize after Week 16, with no clear trend for 
increases between Weeks 24 and 52 for all treatment groups. Mean Cmin values from Weeks 24 to 52

EMA/431298/2014 
Page 10/115 
  
 
 
following TCZ 4 mg/kg were about 16 fold lower on average than those seen following TCZ 8 mg/kg 
(with or without concomitant MTX). Concentration profiles for TCZ 8 mg/kg treatment groups with and 
without concomitant MTX were superimposable indicating no effect of concomitant MTX on TCZ 
exposure. Maximum serum TCZ concentrations in WA19926 were dose proportional following TCZ 4 
mg/kg + MTX and TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX/placebo.

Comparison with previous results - Combination therapy with MTX 
The table below presents observed PK parameters at Week 12 following 8 mg/kg TCZ+MTX from 
WA19926 compared to simulated Cmin and Cmax from the prior population PK analysis. It should be 
noted that the population PK analysis included data from patients receiving TCZ both alone and in 
combination with MTX; however as part of the same analysis, MTX was not shown to have any impact 
on TCZ PK. Cmax values from WA19926 were similar to those from the population analysis based on 
historic data. Cmin values were generally comparable as well, however the comparison was complicated 
by the high degree of variability in the data and the potential for error being introduced by use of 
scheduled rather than exact sample times when summarizing observed data from WA19926.

Please note that the figure is limited by availability of data in common between studies and common 
time scale. 
Figure 2.  Mean ± SEM Pre-Dose TCZ (μg/mL) at Selected Visits 
Comparison with previous results - Monotherapy 
As discussed above, results from WA19926 indicated no effect of concomitant MTX on TCZ exposure in 
patients with early RA. A similar finding for lack of effect of concomitant MTX on TCZ PK (albeit limited 
to Cmin and Cmax) was noted also in the population PK analysis supporting the initial RA submission. 
Graphical comparison with WA17824 (AMBITION) in monotherapy in presented below. It shows 
comparable TCZ levels from WA19926 at 8 mg/kg monotherapy versus those from the same treatment 
up to Week 24 from WA17824 (figure is limited by availability of data in common between studies and 
common time scale).

Figure 3.  Mean ± SEM Pre-Dose TCZ (μg/mL) at Selected Visits 
While week 12 and 24 TCZ level were 12.8-17.6 μg/ml in the pivotal study WA19926, in study 
WA17824 the levels were ~12.5-15.1 μg/ml respectively. 
Steady-state pre-dose (Cmin) concentrations from Clinical Study Report MRA012JP (SAMURAI) following 
treatment with 8 mg/kg TCZ monotherapy (i.e., without concomitant MTX) q4w ranged from 
approximately 12 to 15 μg/mL, slightly lower than those seen in global studies, as expected due to 
lower body weight in Japanese patients. 
Body weight in the pivotal study was indeed higher (75±17 kg) than in study SAMURAI. Since it is 
known, that TCZ Cmax and Cmin are weight dependent, this may account for the observed difference in 
Cmin. 
Special populations 
Responders versus Non-Responders 
The figure below presents pre-dose TCZ concentrations in patients based on their Disease Activity 
Score 28 (DAS28) response status at Week 24, and separates responders from non-responders. 
Patients with a remission response were defined as having a DAS28 score of <2.6. Week 2 
concentrations (14 days following first dose) are also presented.  
Figure 4.  WA19926: Mean ± SEM Pre-Dose TCZ Concentrations (μg/mL) by DAS28 Remission Status 
at Week 24 
Profiles, by treatment group, for DAS28 responders were comparable to those for non-responders, 
indicating that there was no appreciable difference in TCZ exposures in the two patient sub-sets.

Although Cmax values (concentrations at end of infusion following first dose and Week 12 dose) are not 
presented in the figure, review of these values also indicated no clear differences based on DAS28 
response status. TCZ profiles, by treatment group, for DAS28 responders at Week 52 were also 
comparable to those for non-responders (figure not shown). 
The figure below presents pre-dose TCZ concentration-time profiles in patients based on modified total 
Sharp score (mTSS) progression status at Week 52. Patients with an increase in mTSS from baseline 
were defined as progressors. Week 2 concentrations (14 days following first dose) are also presented.  
Figure 5.  WA19926: Mean ± SEM Pre-Dose* TCZ Concentrations (μg/mL) by Modified Total Sharp 
Score (mTSS) Progression Status at Week 52 
PK profiles, by treatment group, for mTSS progressors were comparable to those for non-progressors, 
indicating that there was no difference in TCZ exposures in the two patient sub-sets. Although Cmax 
values (concentrations at end of infusion following first dose and Week 12 dose) are not presented in 
the figures, review of these values also indicated no clear differences based on mTSS status. 
Immunogenicity 
The immunogenicity data from pivotal Study WA19926 are presented, as well as supportive data from 
the placebo-controlled IV TCZ studies in the DMARD-IR population and data from the IV TCZ Long-
Term Extension (LTE) studies all-exposure population. The safety dataset (referred to as the IV TCZ all 
exposure population) includes all data from patients who received at least 1 dose of TCZ in the clinical 
trial program.

Table 5.  WA19926: Patients with Positive Anti-TCZ Assay Results 
Nine patients in the placebo + MTX group (3.2%) had positive results in the screening and 
confirmation assay post-baseline after testing confirmation assay-negative at baseline. This 
phenomenon of positive results for the placebo arm is consistent with what has been observed in 
previous studies. 
Eleven patients in the TCZ treatment groups tested positive for neutralizing anti-TCZ antibodies post-
baseline, however, 3 of these 11 patients (one patient in each treatment group) were not considered 
anti-TCZ neutralizing antibody positive by the MAH because they had a positive confirmation assay at 
baseline. None of these patients withdrew for insufficient therapeutic response or were classified as 
having experienced loss of efficacy. Of note, not considering anti-TCZ neutralization antibody positive 
patients who had confirmed binding antibody at baseline is not supported as they might have a cross-
reacting antibody at baseline and in addition they might have developed neutralizing antibodies upon 
treatment. 
For a comparison, immunogenicity data from previous studies is provided below. 
Table 6.  Immunogenicity data from TCZ-placebo controlled core studies 
A total of 3945 of the 4009 patients in the IV TCZ long term extension studies all-exposure population 
were screened for anti- TCZ antibodies at any time point. Serum samples from 334/3945 patients 
(8.3%) were positive in the screening assay. Serum samples of 44 of 3945 patients (1.1%) tested 
positive post-baseline in the confirmation assay for anti-TCZ antibodies; these patients are referred to 
as “anti-TCZ antibody positive.” Patients with a positive anti-TCZ antibody assay result were tested for 
neutralizing antibodies. A total of 59/3945 patients (1.5%) were post baseline positive for neutralizing 
antibodies. Of these, 40/59 (67.8%) patients had a positive test result by Week 24, and approximately 
46/59 (78.0%) patients had a positive test result within the first year.

Effect of anti-TCZ antibodies on Pharmacokinetics  
Pre-dose TCZ and sIL-6R serum concentrations were evaluated for 13 patients in Study WA19926 who 
developed anti-TCZ antibodies following initiation of treatment and also had available PK-PD data: 6 
patients in the 4 mg/kg TCZ + MTX arm, 4 patients in the 8 mg/kg IV TCZ + MTX arm, and 3 patients 
in the 8 mg/kg TCZ + placebo arm. Eight of these 13 patients also developed neutralizing anti-TCZ 
antibodies. There was no trend for reduced TCZ concentrations in these patients when evaluating their 
PK profiles with individual dosing records and actual sampling times. This indicates that anti-TCZ 
antibodies had no effect on the PK of TCZ with the limited number of patients who developed anti-TCZ 
antibodies in this study. 
Anaphylaxis/Hypersensitivity Reactions 
Of the 19 patients who withdrew from Study WA19926 due to hypersensitivity AEs, 2 tested positive 
for anti-TCZ antibodies. One of the patients (in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX group), who experienced an 
infusion-reaction AE developed anti-TCZ antibodies post-baseline. The other patient (in the TCZ 8 
mg/kg + placebo group), who experienced muscle spasms, tested positive for anti-TCZ antibodies at 
baseline. 
One anaphylactic reaction was observed in the TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX group at the second infusion, and 
one serious hypersensitivity event leading to withdrawal was deemed an “infusion-related reaction” in 
the TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo group. Both patients were negative for anti-TCZ antibodies in the 
confirmatory assay both at baseline and at scheduled testing post-baseline. 
In the IV TCZ long term extension studies five of the 44 anti-TCZ antibody-positive patients 
experienced an anaphylactic reaction. 
Effect of Neutralizing Anti-Tocilizumab Antibodies on Efficacy 
Eleven patients in the TCZ treatment groups tested positive for neutralizing anti-TCZ antibodies post-
baseline, however, 3 of these 11 patients (one patient in each treatment group) were not considered 
anti-TCZ neutralizing antibody positive because they had a positive confirmation assay at baseline. 
None of these patients withdrew due to insufficient therapeutic response or were classified as having 
experienced loss of efficacy (defined as those who withdrew as a result of insufficient therapeutic 
response after achieving at least a 50% improvement of American College of Rheumatology response 
criteria [ACR50] or European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) good response).  
There were an additional three patients who tested positive in the neutralizing assay post-baseline 
without a positive confirmation assay result (2 patients in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX group, and 1 
patient in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo group). These three patients are also considered to have 
developed a neutralizing anti-TCZ antibody response. 
For a comparison, immunogenicity data for the IV TCZ long term extension studies is summarised 
here. No relationship was observed between a positive result for neutralizing anti-TCZ antibodies and 
loss of efficacy. Neutralizing antibodies were also assessed in patients who withdrew due to insufficient 
therapeutic response (irrespective of the screening/confirmation test results). As lack of therapeutic 
response is a subjective assessment, it was also assessed how many of these patients had potentially 
experienced loss of efficacy, based on those patients who had achieved a ACR50 or DAS28 of the 
EULAR good response prior to withdrawing due to insufficient therapeutic response. Among the 
206/4009 (5.1%) patients who withdrew for insufficient therapeutic response, 2 tested positive for 
post-baseline neutralizing antibodies. None of the 83 patients who had documented loss of efficacy 
tested positive for post-baseline neutralizing antibodies

Seroconversion in Patients Who Missed Two or More Consecutive Doses 
Patients in Study WA19926 who missed at least two consecutive IV study drug infusions were tested 
for antibody development before and after missing two doses. A total of 150 patients underwent 
immunogenicity testing for this reason. Valid immunogenicity datasets (data from patients with a valid 
assay both prior to the first consecutive missed dose and after re-starting dosing) were obtained from 
31 of these patients.  
Table 7.  Patients with Positive Anti-TCZ Assay Results Following Dose Interruptions (Safety 
Population) 
Only 2 of these 31 patients had negative results in the confirmation assay prior to the first missed dose 
and then had a positive result in the confirmation after re-starting dosing (1 patient in the TCZ 8 
mg/kg + placebo group, and 1 patient in the placebo + MTX group); both were negative in the 
neutralizing assay. Neither of these patients had AEs related to hypersensitivity or experienced loss of 
efficacy. 
For a comparison, immunogenicity data for the IV TCZ long term extension studies is also summarised. 
Patients who missed more than 2 consecutive TCZ doses did not appear to seroconvert, and the rate of 
immunogenicity was not increased. Of the 3945 patients who were tested for anti-TCZ antibodies, a 
total of 1786 (45.2%) patients had at least one instance in which there were > 70 days between 
doses. These patients were considered to have missed ≥ 2 consecutive infusions. Of these, 849 
patients (47.5%) had anti-TCZ antibody assays performed both before and after missing consecutive 
doses and could therefore be evaluated for the potential of missed doses resulting in anti-TCZ sero-
conversion. The majority (830/849, 97.8%) of evaluable patients were negative (confirmation assay) 
for anti-TCZ antibodies, both before and after missing ≥ 2 consecutive doses. Nine patients (1.1% of 
the evaluable patients) were negative for anti-TCZ antibodies prior to their missed infusions and were 
positive after resuming infusions. However, another 7 patients (0.8%) were anti-TCZ positive before 
missing doses and anti- TCZ negative after resuming treatment. 
Pharmacokinetic/Safety Relationships in Pivotal Study WA19926 
The relationships between rates of all adverse events (AEs) or rates of infections and observed Cmin at 
Week 24 are presented in the table below for the combined (TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX and TCZ 8 mg/kg + 
MTX) group, the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX group and the TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo group.

sIL-6R  
Serum interleukin-6 receptor (sIL-6R) levels were measured at baseline and Weeks 24 and 52. Mean + 
SEM sIL-6R concentration time profiles are plotted in the figure below. Based on limited data available, 
following administration of TCZ, mean sIL-6R concentrations were elevated at Weeks 24 and 52 
compared to baseline. The observed increases in sIL-6R were similar between the two TCZ 8 mg/kg 
treatment groups (with or without concomitant MTX), indicating no effect of concomitant MTX on sIL-
6R. Increases in sIL-6R following TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX were less than those seen at 8 mg/kg TCZ. 
Serum IL-6R levels in patients treated with MTX alone were unchanged compared to baseline.

ESR and CRP  
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured at baseline 
and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 36 and 52. The mean ± SEM ESR profiles and the CRP profiles 
over time are displayed in the figures below. 
A sustained decrease in ESR and normalization of CRP (to levels below 1 mg/dL) throughout Week 52 
were achieved for both groups treated with 8 mg/kg TCZ (with or without concomitant MTX). The 
observed decreases in ESR and CRP were similar between the two 8 mg/kg TCZ treatment groups, 
indicating no effect of concomitant MTX on these PD markers. 
But conversely reductions in ESR and CRP were also seen in patients treated with MTX alone. 
Decreases in ESR following treatment with MTX alone were less than those seen following 4 mg/kg TCZ 
+ MTX. CRP concentrations in the MTX alone group were comparable to those seen following treatment 
with 4 mg/kg TCZ + MTX from Weeks 4 through 52.

Pharmacokinetic/Efficacy Relationships in Pivotal Study WA19926 
DAS28  
A summary of the numbers and proportions of patients with DAS28 remission responses at Week 24 by 
Week 24 Cmin quartiles is displayed in the table below. Patients with a remission response were defined 
as having a DAS28 score < 2.6. There was a large number of patients with undetectable (displayed as 
0 µg/mL) TCZ concentrations at Week 24 in the 4 mg/kg TCZ + MTX group (n=138/246, 
approximately 56% of all observations in this group). As a result, the quartiles would have been 
extremely unbalanced with regard to sample size. Therefore, a quartile analysis was performed on a 
combination of patients participating in the TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX and TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX groups 
instead of TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX group alone; this analysis represents the continuum of all Cmin values 
at Week 24 in patients receiving both dose levels of TCZ in combination with MTX. There remained a 
slight imbalance in the first and second quartiles of this "combination" group since a total of 155 
patients had undetectable concentrations; this was a consequence of the low trough concentrations 
seen with TCZ 4 mg/kg dosing. 
Table 9.  WA19926: Patients with DAS28 Remission Response at Week 24 by Week 24 C min 
Quartiles 
For the combined (TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX and TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX) group, there was a clear trend for an 
increased proportion  of  DAS28  responders  as  Cmin  increased  across  the  four  quartiles.  For  the  TCZ  8 
mg/kg  +  MTX  group  and  the  TCZ  8  mg/kg  +  placebo  group,  there  was  a  trend  for  an  increased 
proportion  of  DAS28  responders  as  Cmin  quartiles  increased  from  the  first  to  third  quartile,  but  no 
further increase afterwards; indicating the response may have reached a plateau. The DAS28 response 
rate for the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX group was higher than that for the TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo group at 
the second, third and  fourth quartiles, despite similar Cmin levels, suggesting additional response due 
to the concomitant MTX treatment. 
However, an alternative analysis yielded different conclusion. A scatter plot of DAS28 scores at Week 
24 versus Cmin at Week 24 is shown in the figure below.

Figure 9.  WA19926: Scatter Plot of DAS28 Score and C min at Week 24 
A clear correlation was not seen between raw DAS28 scores and Cmin at Week 24 in patients in any of 
the active TCZ treatment groups. Indeed Pearson correlation coefficients ranged from -0.116 to 0.1245, 
further supporting the lack of clear correlation.  
Modified Total Sharp Score 
In study WA17823, the so called X-ray population consisted of patients who had available PK 
parameters, completed the 52 weeks treatment of the study and provided radiographic scores. Patients 
randomized to placebo that went on escape therapy were excluded from that population. The X-ray 
population consisted of 615 rheumatoid arthritis patients. 
The relationship between the radiographic score changes from baseline and the cumulative TCZ AUC 
up to week 52 was assessed graphically by comparing the AUC in responders and non-responders. The 
responders were defined as patients with a score at week 52 below or equal to score at baseline and 
non-responders as patients with a score at week 52 above the score at baseline. 
The plots of the time course of each radiographic score (in absolute change and in percentage change 
from baseline) for the placebo group and for the three categories of AUC (low, medium, high) are 
presented in the figures below for the erosion score, for the joint space narrowing score and for the 
modified Sharp score.

obvious difference of the joint space narrowing score can be noticed between the groups. The resultant 
of those two scores, the modified Sharp score seems to progress more slowly in highest exposure 
categories compared to the placebo group. See also the table below.

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
No separate PK/PD or immunogenicity study was conducted in the MTX-naïve RA population. PK/PD 
and immunogenicity parameters were measured in the pivotal study and summarized descriptively. 
The derived PK data were also compared with historical data from previously submitted pivotal studies. 
The set of PK parameters reported is reduced to Cmin, Cmax and Cwk2, since the sampling schedule did 
RoActemra 
EMA/431298/2014 
Page 25/115 
  
 
 
 
not allow for a single dose PK profile. Thus only limited evidence can be derived from it, which is 
nevertheless commonly considered adequate for this type of application. 
Validated assays were used for determination of IL-6sR and neutralizing anti-TCZ antibodies in serum 
as well as for anti-TCZ antibodies screening and confirmatory assay. Calibration and quality control 
were adequate, assay performance was satisfactory. The same assay formats appear to have been 
used as in the initial filing. Nevertheless, several methodological short comings were addressed, which 
result in uncertainties about the interpretation of results. The issue of further monitoring of 
immunogenicity is being addressed in the RMP.  
The methodology for evaluation of immunogenicity has previously been assessed and agreed to. The 
change which was implemented by using the patient’s own baseline value as cut point is considered 
adequate. 
The PK profile in the early RA population relevant to the current variation was descriptively analysed in 
pivotal study WA19926 (FUNCTION) and compared to historical data, e.g. profile of TCZ in patients 
with RA as characterized in the original submission. Due to the limited number of samples per patient 
no AUC was derived directly in the current study. 
In patients with early, moderate to severe RA of less than 2 years duration who were naïve to 
treatment with both MTX and a biologic agent: 
•  Mean TCZ pre-dose concentrations appeared to show no clear trend for further increases between 
Weeks 24 and 52 for all treatment groups. 
•  Mean Cmin values from Weeks 24 to 52 following TCZ 4 mg/kg were about 16 fold lower on average 
than those seen following TCZ 8 mg/kg (with or without concomitant MTX). This is more than what 
has been described in the Population PK analysis of pivotal studies from previous filings and 
apparently due to the higher concentration level following TCZ 8 mg/kg in study WA19926. The 
MAH was asked to comment on the discrepancy in C min at steady state of the pivotal study (~ 18 
μg/ml) and the Population PK report (based on four previously filed pivotal studies, Ctrough of 9.74 
± 10.5 μg/ml). 
•  Concentration profiles for TCZ 8 mg/kg treatment groups with and without concomitant MTX were 
superimposable indicating no effect of concomitant MTX on TCZ exposure. This is in alignment with 
the previous Population PK report findings. 
•  Maximum serum TCZ concentrations in WA19926 were dose proportional following TCZ 4 mg/kg + 
MTX and TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX/placebo. 
It is acknowledged that the variability of the concentration parameters is extremely high limiting the 
reliability of the information that can be derived from it. Overall, the PK data from the pivotal study are 
sparse given the restricted sampling time points in the individual patient, the reduced set of PK 
parameters available and the descriptive analysis. 
Furthermore, there also seems to be a discrepancy between the Ctrough levels derived from the 
Population PK analysis of the previous phase III studies, which are used for comparison, and the 
actually measured values in some of these studies. In contrast to the Population PK analysis (based on 
studies WA17822, WA17824, WA18062, and WA18063; OPTION, AMBITION, RADIATE, TOWARD), 
which suggests a Ctrough at steady state of 9.74 μg/ml, study WA17823 (LITHE) in MTX-inadequate 
responders indicates a higher Cmin level (week 24-week52: ~15.5-17.6 μg/ml) comparable to the 
current pivotal study. Similarly, a graphical comparison indicates that TCZ administered as 
monotherapy (8 mg/kg) results in concentrations at week 12 and week 24 in the range of 13-17 μg/ml 
that are comparable in MTX naïve RA patients (current pivotal trial) and the RA patients that 
discontinued MTX (WA17824, AMBITION).  
RoActemra 
EMA/431298/2014 
Page 26/115 
  
 
 
Taken together, these observations suggest that the Population PK analysis may not adequately reflect 
Ctrough levels in the previously submitted phase III studies, which are used for comparison in the 
current variation application and is currently reflected in the SmPC. Of note, on 6 May 2014 the MAH 
has submitted a type II variation to update the PK information in the SmPC. Assessment of that 
variation is ongoing. 
The PK profiles of TCZ 8 mg/kg with/out MTX and of TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX are comparable between 
patients, who showed a response in terms of reduction of DAS 28 score to < 2.6 at week 2, and non-
responders. There is also no difference in the PK profiles of TCZ 8 mg/kg with/out MTX and of TCZ 4 
mg/kg + MTX between patients, who progressed in terms of mTSS (week52) and those who 
experienced no progression.  
In the pivotal study, the numbers of patients who were considered to have developed post-baseline 
anti-TCZ antibodies in the TCZ treatment groups up to Week 52 ranged from approximately 1% to 2%. 
The percentage of patients who developed neutralizing anti-TCZ antibodies was also low (1.0% − 
1.7%). Overall, the submitted results suggest that immunogenicity of all three dose cohort (TCZ 
4mg/kg, TCZ 8 mg/kg ± MTX) was in the same range as previously observed in other RA studies at 
these dose regimens. However, the results of immunogenicity assessments in the placebo group of 
study WA19926 are puzzling as the percentage of patients who developed TCZ antibodies was higher 
than in any of TCZ groups. A few patients were found positive for TCZ binding antibody at baseline. In 
MAH’s opinion this phenomenon is likely due to the potential biological interferences (e.g. 
autoantibodies) in the screening/confirmation assays, indicating that rheumatoid factor (RF) has the 
potential to cause false positive results. To explain the observations, the possible interference of RF 
with the detection of anti-TCZ antibody needs to be explored in more details. The CHMP therefore 
recommends the MAH to address the possible interference by RF and conduct a study to support the 
sensitivity and specificity of the assays used in the immunogenicity testing for assessing the possible 
immunogenicity of TCZ. The MAH has confirmed that it will further investigate the RF interference in 
the immunogenicity assay, providing full study details in Q4 2014 and the study results in Q2 2015. 
Neutralizing capacity appears more specific since no neutralizing antibody was found among patients 
not treated by TCZ. 
The effect of anti-TCZ antibodies on PK was evaluated in only 13 patients, of which eight had 
developed neutralizing antibodies. The MAH reports that there was no trend for reduced TCZ 
concentration. However, given this very low number no conclusions should be drawn from this.  
Only one (1/17; e.g. 5.9%) of the patients, who developed anti-TCZ antibodies post-baseline, 
experienced an infusion reaction (but no anaphylactic reaction). This patient was 1 of 3 patients, who 
developed ADAs under monotherapy with TCZ. In comparison, in the IV TCZ long term extension 
studies about twice as many patients with ADA experienced anaphylaxis (5/44, 11.4%). In the pivotal 
study, the overall incidence of TCZ related anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity is low (0.12%), even in the 8 
mg/kg TCZ group (0.3%). The overall incidence of ADA related anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity is low 
(0.13%), even in the 8 mg/kg TCZ group (0.3%). It is recommended that patients who experienced 
anaphylactic/hypersensitivity reactions should be tested by the neutralization assay as well. 
The link between neutralizing ADAs against TCZ and a loss of efficacy is rather weak, since neither in 
the pivotal study nor in the long term extension studies any of the patients with a post-baseline 
positive neutralizing ADA test results had documented loss of efficacy. 
Sero-conversion was documented in 1/31 evaluable patients (3.2%) treated with TCZ in the pivotal 
study and who missed at least two consecutive IV infusions, but it did not result in the development of 
neutralizing ADAs. This is higher than the incidence observed in the IV TCZ long term studies (9/849, 
1.1%), but the difference may have to be attributed to the low number of the evaluable patients in the 
RoActemra 
EMA/431298/2014 
Page 27/115 
  
 
 
pivotal study. Overall, sero-conversion is not expected to constitute a major aspect of or effect on 
safety and efficacy. 
There is a trend that the risk of having infection is increased by about 20% in the highest exposure 
(Q4) group when patients are treated with TCZ 8 mg/kg and MTX. This might be understood based on 
general principles of pharmacology. However, given that the range of infection AEs/100 patient years 
are roughly comparable across the treatment regimens and fluctuate quite substantially (with the 95% 
CIs of the quartiles overlapping), the increase in the 4th concentration quartile in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + 
MTX group may also just be a chance finding. 
Pharmacodynamics 
There were two goals of the PD and PK/PD measurements. First was to demonstrate that TCZ has 
additional effect to MTX in patients previously not treated with MTX. Second was to show that early 
treatment with TCZ can halt or even reverse the disease progression based on radiological 
assessments. Such claims could be demonstrated if positive concentration - response (PK/PD) 
relationship was shown (as proof of efficacy and, additionally, guiding the correct dosing). The MAH 
measured several markers of the disease symptoms and progression, but the relevance of the markers 
are markedly different regarding to the short and long-term clinical effects. 
The concentration of serum interleukin-6 receptor (sIL-6R) is directly related to TCZ exposure, but a 
firm link between sIL-6R level and disease activity or clinical response has not been established yet. 
The increase in serum sIL-6R seen after administration of TCZ is probably due to the formation of a 
sIL-6R/TCZ immune complex which cannot be eliminated by its normal receptor-mediated pathway. 
CRP seems to be a better predictor because CRP is mainly produced by hepatocytes, which express 
cell-surface IL-6R. CRP therefore seems to be a surrogate marker for TCZ levels that are high enough 
to inhibit the effects of IL-6 in patients. 
The ESR is governed by the balance between pro-sedimentation factors, mainly fibrinogen, and those 
factors resisting sedimentation, namely the negative charge of the erythrocytes (zeta potential). When 
an inflammatory process is present, the high proportion of fibrinogen in the blood causes red blood 
cells to stick to each other. The ESR is increased by any inflammation. 
The progression of RA was followed using the Disease Activity Score of 28 joints (DAS28). It is widely 
used as an indicator of RA disease activity and response to treatment, but is not always a reliable 
indicator of treatment effect. Note that ESR (or CRP) is directly linked to DAS28. 
The modified total Sharp score (mTSS) measures peripheral joint involvement. It is an index based on 
radiographs and directly linked to the clinical outcome. 
For the stated purposes data were collected in two studies:  
•  Study WA19926 which is of the pivotal Phase III study (WA19926) supporting this Type II 
application 
•  Study WA17823 which was a study in moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis. Thus this 
study has only a supporting role in this Type II variation, as the study and target patient groups of 
Type II application are different. The planned study period of Study WA17823 was two years 
however only results of an interim analysis (results after 52 weeks) were submitted.  
The scope of PK/PD analysis was very limited because it is essentially narrowed down to investigating 
the relationship between C min and a PD parameter, while Cmin is not a good predictor of the overall 
exposure due to the nonlinear features of TCZ pharmacokinetics. Therefore the PK sampling strategy

was very far from being optimal, which potentially can explain why the MAH could not demonstrate a 
robust concentration-effect relationship. 
sIL-6R levels similarly increased in the two TCZ 8 mg/kg treatment groups (with or without 
concomitant MTX) in study WA 19926. This was expected because sIL-6R levels have been shown 
directly related to the TCZ mode of action and not to the therapeutic outcome.  
A sustained decrease in ESR and normalization of CRP (to levels below 1 mg/dL) throughout Week 52 
were achieved for both groups treated with 8 mg/kg TCZ. The observed decreases in ESR and CRP 
were similar between the two 8 mg/kg TCZ treatment groups (with or without concomitant MTX). This 
is in contrast with results for MTX alone, which also was effective. However, some differences between 
CRP and ESR were observed. The ESR decrease following treatment with MTX alone was less than that 
seen following 4 mg/kg TCZ + MTX while CRP concentrations in the only MTX group were comparable 
with values following treatment with 4 mg/kg TCZ + MTX. The most plausible assumption to explain 
these findings is that the maximum possible (plateau) level has been achieved alone with the dose of 8 
mg/kg TCZ that is why the additionally administered MTX apparently had no additional effect on ESR 
and CRP. The same is true for CRP and 4 mg/kg dose is sufficient to reach the maximum effect. 
A scatter plot of DAS28 scores at Week 24 versus C min at Week 24 was presented. No clear correlation 
is seen between raw DAS28 scores and Cmin at Week 24 in patients in any of the active TCZ treatment 
groups. Pearson correlation coefficients ranged from -0.116 to 0.1245, further supporting the lack of a 
clear correlation. Still, using an alternative statistical approach, some tendency between Cmin and 
DAS28 could have been demonstrated. A summary of the numbers and proportions of patients with 
DAS28 remission responses at Week 24 by Week 24 Cmin quartiles was also presented. Quartile 
analysis was performed on a combination of patients participating in the TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX and TCZ 
8 mg/kg + MTX groups. The results show a trend for an increased proportion of DAS28 responders as 
Cmin quartiles increased from the first to third quartile, but no further increase afterwards. This 
indicates that the response may have reached a plateau. The DAS28 response rate for the TCZ 8 
mg/kg + MTX group was higher than that for the TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo group at the second, third 
and fourth quartiles, despite similar Cmin levels, suggesting additional response due to the concomitant 
MTX treatment. 
On the other hand, mTSS does not show the plateau effect seen on inflammatory markers and DAS28 
in study WA19926. The results suggest that TCZ+MTX combination is more effective than giving MTX 
or TCZ (8 mg/kg) alone. However, mTSS is also a composite score and it seems only one of its 
components (bone erosion) is slowed down due to treatment. The other component, progression of 
narrowing of the joint space, has not been affected at all. 
It is noted that higher exposure is associated also with additional risk – infection rate might be 
increased by about 20% in the highest quartile group when the patients are treated with TCZ 8 mg/kg 
and MTX. 
The MAH suggested that early treatment with TCZ might slow down or even reverse the joint 
destruction process. The radiographic results of study WA17823 do not directly support this claim 
because in study WA17823 patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis were involved. 
By the protocol study WA17823 lasted for two years with an additional follow-up period. As presented 
above it seems that in some patients the bone and joint destruction process has been halted or even 
reversed after one year of TCZ treatment. It would be interesting to know that TCZ stopped the 
destruction process or just delayed it. However, the final closing report of WA17823 has not been 
submitted.

2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the provided results, albeit limited and descriptive only, appear to indicate comparable PK of 
TCZ and immunogenicity between the MTX-naïve RA population and already approved RA populations. 
Firm conclusions cannot be drawn based on the results of the PK-PD analysis. The MAH could not 
demonstrate statistically significant concentration-effect relationship between TCZ exposures and the 
clinically decisive parameters such as DAS28 and mTSS. By visual inspection of the data (results of 
studies WA19926 and WA17823), a very weak positive tendency can be observed between TCZ 
exposures and clinical effects. Based on that, it might be hypothetically assumed, that larger doses are 
required to slow down disease progression as seen by X-ray than to achieve remission (based on 
DAS28). However, higher exposure is associated with additional risk (infection rate might be increased 
by about 20% in the highest quartile group when the patients are treated with TCZ 8 mg/kg and MTX).  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical efficacy data provided consist of the results of the Week-52 data of the pivotal Phase III 
trial, WA19926 (FUNCTION). Supporting data was provided by studies, WA17824 and Chugai Study 
MRA012JP. In addition, data concerning persistence of efficacy from the WA17823 (LITHE) study and 
from long-term extension (LTE) in early RA and monotherapy subgroups were also presented.

2.4.1.  Main study 
Study WA19926 
Methods 
Study WA19926 was a multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, and parallel-group study of the safety, 
disease remission and prevention of structural joint damage during treatment with tocilizumab, as a

monotherapy and in combination with methotrexate, versus methotrexate in patients with early, 
moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis. 
The study duration is 2 years. In this submission the Week 52 data were reported. Data from Week 
104 will be reported at a later time. 
Figure 14.  WA19926 Study Design 
At Week 52, patients in the TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX and placebo + MTX treatment groups who had a 
DAS28 of ≥ 3.2 could receive escape therapy with TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX.  
Study participants 
The target population for this study was adult patients with moderate-to-severe active early RA who 
were naïve to treatment with both MTX and a biologic agent. RA was diagnosed according to the 1987 
revised American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. 
Eligible patients had: 
•  DAS28 > 3.2 both at screening and baseline visits 
•  Swollen joint count (SJC) ≥ 4 (66 joint count) and tender joint count (TJC) ≥ 6 (68 joint count) 
both at screening and baseline visits 
•  Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) ≥ 28 mm/hr or C reactive protein (CRP) ≥ 10 mg/L at 
screening visit only 
• 
Positivity for either rheumatoid factor or anti-CCP antibodies (Abs) at screening or if negative for 
rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP Ab, ≥ 1 erosion of hands, wrists, or feet at screening (erosion 
determined by central reading of X-rays) 
The number of patients negative for both RF and anti-CCP Ab was limited to 20% of the total study 
population. 
RoActemra

Patients were ineligible if they had received previous treatment with MTX or a biologic agent. All other 
DMARD therapies were discontinued prior to study entry. 
Treatments 
The following treatments were applied in this study: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX 
TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo (TCZ 8 mg/kg monotherapy) 
TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX 
Placebo + MTX (MTX monotherapy) 
TCZ was administered every four weeks for the duration of the study. MTX was administered 7.5 − 20 
mg/week oral tablets for the duration of the study. 
During the study, patients were allowed to continue to receive a background corticosteroid dose of 
≤10 mg/day of prednisone (or equivalent). Doses had to continue unchanged for at least the first 6 
months of the study and remain stable for the duration of the study. 
At study entry, stable oral NSAID doses were allowed and continued unchanged for at least the first 6 
months of the study and remained stable for the duration of the study. 
Analgesics other than NSAIDs were permitted for pain management as required. However, patients 
were not allowed to take analgesics within 12 hours prior to a visit.  
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of treatment with TCZ in combination 
with MTX and TCZ monotherapy versus MTX monotherapy in patients with early, moderate-to severe 
RA. 
Additional objectives included assessment of prevention of structural joint damage over 12 months and 
maintenance of this effect at 24 months, improvement in physical function over 12 months and 
maintenance of this effect at 24 months.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint of the study was proportion of patients who achieved Disease Activity Score 
(DAS) 28 remission (DAS28 < 2.6) at 6 months. 
The primary comparison was between the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX and placebo + MTX treatment groups. 
Secondary endpoints 
Secondary endpoints included: 
•  DAS28 remission response at week 52 
•  ACR20, ACR50, ACR70 response at Week 24 and Week 52 
•  Change from baseline in mTSS at Week 52 
•  Change from baseline in in modified Sharp erosion score at Week 52 
RoActemra 
EMA/431298/2014 
Page 32/115 
  
 
 
•  Change from baseline in modified Sharp Joint Space Narrowing (JSN) score at Week 52 
•  Major clinical response (defined as achieving a continuous 6-month period of success by the 
ACR70) at Week 52 
•  Change from baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQDI) score at Weeks 
24 and 52  
•  Change from baseline in Short Form 36 (SF-36) physical component summary (PCS) scores at 
Weeks 24 and 52 
Further exploratory parameters were also analysed. 
Sample size 
Based on data from earlier studies in patients with early RA, a DAS28 remission response rate at week 
24 of 16% was assumed for the placebo + MTX group and 26% for patients with TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX. 
It was calculated that 282 patients per group would allow detecting such a difference with 80% power 
in a two-sided test at a significance level of 5%. Based on these calculations a total of 1128 patients 
were to be included into the study. Accounting for 10% for patients with insufficient radiographic data, 
the planned sample size of 282 patients per group was estimated also to provide about 98% power to 
detect a mean difference of 2.17 units in change from baseline in modified total Sharp score between 
the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX treatment group and the Placebo + MTX treatment group in a two-sided test 
at 5% significant level. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of the four treatment groups. Randomization was 
stratified by serologic status (RF and/or anti-CCP Ab positivity) and by geographic region (Europe, 
North America, South America, ROW). 
Blinding (masking) 
According protocol and CSR study WA19926 was a double blind study. 
To minimize the risk of unblinding of investigational staff, monitors, central services (central lab), and 
Roche study management team during the remainder of the study, the week 52 data analysis was 
performed by a selected group of Sponsor’s team members only and was not to be communicated to 
investigational staff, monitors or central services. Furthermore the week 104 analyses do not plan for 
any formal comparison between treatment arms. 
Statistical methods 
The between treatment group comparisons (TCZ groups versus placebo + MTX) for the primary and 
secondary endpoints was based on the following methods: 
•  Binary response variables, such as the DAS28 response at week 24, were primarily analysed using 
a logistic regression model with the stratification factors at randomisation as covariates. In addition 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel-test stratified for the strata used in randomisation was applied. 
• 
The change from baseline in the radiographic scores at week 52 was compared between the TCZ 
treatment groups and the placebo + MTX treatment group using a non-parametric analysis of 
covariance. 
RoActemra 
EMA/431298/2014 
Page 33/115 
  
 
 
•  Continuous variables other than the radiographic scores were analyzed using an analysis of 
covariance model, with treatment group, the baseline score, and the stratification factors applied 
at randomization included in the model. 
• 
Treatment effects were described by means of 95%-confidence intervals. 
The TCZ groups were compared to the placebo+MTX group for superiority based on the ITT population. 
All statistical (null-) hypotheses (of no treatment effect) for the primary and secondary endpoints and 
treatment comparisons were tested at the 5% significance level (α = 0.05) against two-sided 
alternatives. The analyses of endpoints and treatment comparisons were performed in a pre-defined, 
fixed sequential order to control the type I error rate for multiple comparisons. For comparisons that 
occurred after the hierarchical chain break, statistical significance is not claimed.  
The primary efficacy analysis was the comparison of DAS28 remission response rate at week 24 
between the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX and placebo + MTX treatment groups. The TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo 
and TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX treatment groups were also compared with the placebo + MTX group when 
the primary comparison null hypothesis was rejected. These treatment comparisons were included into 
the hierarchical testing procedure (at positions 13 and 18 respectively). Please see full list of 
hierarchical testing in the results section. 
For binary endpoints missing values were considered as non-responder; in case of radiographic 
endpoints missing data were imputed by means of linear extrapolation. In order to assess the 
robustness of results additional analyses using an LOCF approach or complete data only were 
performed.  
Results 
Participant flow 
Of the 1846 patients screened 1162 patients were randomised to treatment. Five patients withdrew 
prior to receiving any study treatment.

Figure 15.  Overview of patient disposition 
The number of patients who completed Week 24 and Week 52 (87%-89% and 79%-81%, respectively) 
was similar across treatment groups. 
The rate of withdrawal was calculated at Week 24 of the study, which was the time point at which the 
primary endpoint was evaluated and at Week 52. The proportion of patients who prematurely withdrew 
from treatment was balanced between the four treatment groups at Week 24 (ranging from 11% − 
13% of patients) and Week 52 (19% − 22% of patients). However, there was an imbalance in the 
proportion of patients who withdrew for safety/non-safety reasons between treatment groups at both 
Week 24 and Week 52. 
At Week 24, in the placebo + MTX group, withdrawals were mainly driven by non−safety-related 
reasons versus safety reasons (27 versus 5 patients), most notably insufficient therapeutic response 
and refused treatment. Whereas, in the TCZ 8mg/kg + MTX treatment group, the withdrawal rates 
were driven chiefly by safety reasons versus non−safety-related reasons (29 versus 11 patients), 
mostly AEs. 
Withdrawals were evenly split between safety and non-safety related reasons in the TCZ 4 mg/kg + 
MTX (17 versus 18 patients) and TCZ 8 mg/kg monotherapy treatment group (15 patients versus 17 
patients).  
Recruitment 
The first patient was screened on 30 September 2009, and the first patient was enrolled on 19 October 
2009. The last patient was enrolled on 17 May 2011 and the last patient completed Week 52 on 23 
May 2012. 
Conduct of the study 
There were two substantial amendments to the original study protocol: 
•  Amendment B (14 December 2009): Changes in the study protocol included:

− 
Implementation of the dose capping strategy in which patients weighing > 100 kg had their 
TCZ/placebo dose capped at 800 mg.  
−  Update of the risk mitigation strategy. 
•  Amendment C (7 January 2011): Major change was the introduction of additional guidance on how 
to proceed in case of anaphylaxis or serious hypersensitivity.

Table 13.  Summary of RA baseline disease characteristics (ITT population) 
The study was designed to recruit patients with RA duration of ≤ 2 years. The mean and median 
duration of RA across treatment groups was 0.4−0.5 years and 0.2−0.3 years, respectively. 
RF and anti-CCP Ab positivity was a stratification factor for randomisation and RF and anti-CCP Ab 
negativity was limited to 20%. Thus the majority of patients in all treatment groups (89%−91% and 
86%−87%, respectively) were positive for RF and anti-CCP Ab at baseline. 
In all four treatment groups, the mean DAS28 at baseline was high at 6.6−6.7 (range: 3.0−9.0), 
reflecting the severity of disease in the recruited early RA patient population (severe disease being 
defined as a DAS28 > 5.1). 
The number of previously used DMARDs was low (mean, 0.2−0.3) across all treatment groups. In fact, 
the majority of patients (76.4%−81.7% across all treatment groups) were also DMARD-naïve. 
The percentage of patients using oral corticosteroids was also relatively low across all treatment 
groups but slightly fewer patients in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX group were using oral corticosteroids at 
baseline compared with the other three treatment groups (33% versus 37% [TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX], 
40% [TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo], and 38% [placebo + MTX]). 
Other baseline disease characteristics (including SJC66, TJC68, ESR, CRP, HAQ-DI, Pain VAS, physician 
VAS and Global VAS score) were generally balanced between all four treatment groups and the number 
of active joints, elevated ESR or CRP, high HAQ-DI and VAS scores again indicated that the RA 
population recruited had active, progressive disease. The mean and median values of DAS28 
components were balanced across treatment groups.

Primary endpoint 
The study met its primary endpoint of proportion of patients with DAS28 remission (DAS< 2.6).  
The proportion of patients in DAS28 remission at Week 24 was significantly higher in the TCZ 8 mg/kg 
+ MTX group than in the placebo + MTX group (44.8% versus 15.0%; OR = 4.77, 95%-CI: 3.19 – 
7.14; p < 0.0001).  
RoActemra 
EMA/431298/2014 
Page 41/115 
  
 
 
 
The proportion of patients in DAS28 remission at Week 24 was also significantly higher in the TCZ 8 
mg/kg + placebo group than in the placebo + MTX group (38.7% versus 15.0%; OR = 3.70; 95%-CI: 
2.47 – 5.55; p < 0.0001). The proportion of patients in DAS28 remission in the TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX 
was numerically greater than in the placebo + MTX group (31.9% versus 15.0%; OR = 2.72; 95%-CI: 
1.80 – 4.11) however, this comparison fell after the hierarchical break in statistical testing.  
The two robustness analyses performed (observed case and LOCF analysis) showed results consistent 
with the logistic regression analysis. In addition, an analysis using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test 
adjusted for the stratification variables of region and serologic status showed that a higher proportion 
of patients who achieved DAS28 remission in the TCZ treatment group (44.8% [TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX], 
38.7% [TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo] and 31.9% [TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX]) compared with 15% [placebo + 
MTX], which is consistent with the logistic regression results.  
Secondary and exploratory endpoints  
DAS28 Remission over Time 
Figure 16.  Percentage of Patients with DAS28 Remission Status by Visit (ITT Population) 
A clear separation between TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX and TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo compared with the 
placebo + MTX group was apparent by Week 4, with the percentage of patients achieving DAS28 
remission being 12.8% [TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX] and 10.3% [TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo] compared with 
1.4% in the placebo + MTX group. 
A clear separation between TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX and placebo + MTX group was apparent by Week 8, 
with the percentage of patients achieving DAS28 remission being 12.5% in TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX group 
compared with 5.2% in the placebo + MTX group. 
To assess the maintenance of the effect of the DAS28 remission, an exploratory analysis of the 
proportion of DAS28 remission responders at both Weeks 24 and 52 was performed. This showed that 
79.2% of Week 24 responders were still a DAS28 responder at Week 52 in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX 
group compared with 55.8% in the placebo + MTX group. In all, 70.8% of patients in the TCZ 8 mg/kg

+ placebo group maintained their response from Week 24 to Week 52 as did 76.1% of patients in the

DAS28 Low Disease Activity (≤ 3.2) 
The proportion of patients achieving DAS28 low disease activity at Week 24 was numerically higher in 
TCZ treatment groups compared with placebo + MTX treatment group (57.6% [TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX], 
50.7% [TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo], 45.5% [TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX], and 26.8% [placebo + MTX]), 
respectively, with the highest proportion of responders in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX group. The results 
at Week 52 were similar to those seen at Week 24. 
ACR20, ACR50, ACR70 
The response rates were numerically higher for all TCZ groups in comparison with placebo + MTX, with 
the highest response rates seen in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX group. Similar results were seen at Week 
52.

Table 19.  Shift Table of Proportion of ACR20 Responders at Weeks 24 and 52 (ITT Population) 
Exploratory analysis of the proportion of ACR20 responders at both Weeks 24 and 52 simultaneously 
showed that high proportions of patients maintained an ACR20 response from Week 24 to Week 52 in 
all treatment groups. The results also showed that the TCZ treatment groups achieved a higher 
proportion of patients who maintained ACR20 response from Week 24 to Week 52 compared with 
placebo + MTX (82.9% [TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX], 76.6% [TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo], 77.8% [TCZ 4 mg/kg 
+ MTX] and 74.9% [placebo + MTX]). In addition, this summary showed that a number of patients 
achieved a late ACR20 response given that approximately 20% of the Week 24 non-responders went 
on to achieve an ACR20 response at Week 52 in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX, TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX, and 
placebo + MTX groups. In the TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo group, 31% of Week 24 non-responders 
achieved an ACR20 response at Week 52.  
Major Clinical Response 
A major clinical response (MCR) was defined as maintenance of an ACR70 response for a continuous 
period of 24 weeks (or longer). The percentage of patients who achieved a MCR by Week 52 was 
numerically higher for TCZ treatment groups compared with placebo + MTX (31% [TCZ 8 mg/kg + 
MTX], 22% [TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo], 22% [TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX] and 16% [placebo + MTX]).  
These findings were consistent with the results observed for ACR20 and ACR50 up to Week 52. Both 
endpoints also showed numerically higher percentages of patients maintaining a response for at least 
24 weeks continuously in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX (66% ACR20; 46% ACR50); TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo 
(59% ACR20; 38% ACR50); and TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX (57% ACR20; 40% ACR50) when compared with 
placebo + MTX (50% ACR20; 32% ACR50), although they were not evaluated statistically.  
Modified Total Sharp-van de Heijde Score (mTSS) 
The mean change from baseline to Week 52 in mTSS was significantly lower in the TCZ 8mg/kg + MTX 
group compared with placebo + MTX (0.08 versus1.14; p = 0.0001). Numerically lower mean changes 
from baseline to Week 52 in mTSS were also observed for the TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo and TCZ 4 
mg/kg + MTX groups versus placebo + MTX(0.26 and 0.42 versus 1.14, respectively). The percentage

reductions in mTSS (from baseline to Week 52) compared with placebo + MTX were 93% [TCZ 8 
mg/kg + MTX], 77% [TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo], and 63% [TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX]. 
Modified Sharp Erosion Score 
The mean change from baseline to Week 52 in modified Sharp erosion score was significantly lower in 
TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX treatment group compared with placebo + MTX (0.05 versus 0.63, respectively; p 
= 0.00069). Numerically lower mean change from baseline to Week 52 in mTSS was observed for TCZ 
8 mg/kg + placebo and TCZ4 mg/kg + MTX groups compared with placebo + MTX group (0.15 and 
0.25 versus 0.63). 
Modified Joint Space Narrowing 
The mean change from baseline to Week 52 in JSN was numerically lower for all TCZ groups compared 
with placebo + MTX (0.03 [TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX], 0.11 [TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo], 0.17 [TCZ 4 mg/kg 
+ MTX], and 0.51 [placebo + MTX]. 
Proportion of Patients without Radiographic Progression (Exploratory) 
No progression (i.e., no worsening) was defined as a change from baseline of ≤ 0. 
At Week 52, the proportion of patients with no progression from baseline in their total Sharp-van der 
Heijde score was greater in the TCZ treatment groups (83% [TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX], 82% [TCZ 8 
mg/kg + placebo and 79% [TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX]) compared with 73% in the placebo + MTX group, 
with similar results at Week 24. The differences between the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX and TCZ 8 mg/kg + 
placebo groups compared with the placebo + MTX group yielded descriptive p-values <0.05 from the 
logistic regression stratified by region and serologic status at both Weeks 24 and 52; however, the 
comparison of TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX and placebo + MTX did not yield a descriptive p<0.05.  
At Week 52, the proportion of patients with no progression of erosion from baseline was greater in the 
TCZ groups (86% [TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX], 87% [TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo] and 83% [TCZ 4 mg/kg + 
MTX] compared with 76% in the placebo + MTX group). Similar results were observed at Week 24. The 
differences in the proportion of patients between both TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX and TCZ 8 mg/kg + 
placebo groups compared with the placebo + MTX group yielded descriptive p-values <0.05 at both 
Weeks 24 and 52. The comparison of TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX with placebo + MTX yielded a descriptive p-
value <0.05 at Week 24 but did not at Week 52.  
At Week 52, the proportion of patients with no progression of JSN from baseline was greater in the 
TCZ groups compared with placebo + MTX (93% [TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX], 92% [TCZ 8 mg/kg + 
placebo], 91% [TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX], and 88% [placebo + MTX] group). Similar results were seen at 
Week 24. The differences between the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX compared with placebo + MTX yielded 
descriptive p-values <0.05 at both Weeks 24 and 52. However, the comparisons of TCZ 8 mg/kg + 
placebo and TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX groups with placebo + MTX for the proportion of patients with no JSN 
progression did not achieve descriptive p-values of < 0.05 at either timepoint.  
ACR/EULAR Boolean and Index remission as well as CDAI remission (exploratory) 
Since the initiation of the WA19926 study, ACR and EULAR have introduced more stringent remission 
measures, and therefore ACR/EULAR Boolean and Index remission as well as CDAI remission were 
added as exploratory endpoints in WA19926.

Table 20.  Percentage of Patients with ACR/EULAR Remission (Boolean and Index-Based 
Definitions) at Weeks 24 and 52 
The remission rate was greater in all three TCZ treatment groups than in the placebo + MTX group, 
across all remission endpoints. At Week 24, a greater proportion of patients achieved the most 
stringent ACR/EULAR Boolean remission in both the TCZ 8 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg + MTX treatment 
groups compared to the placebo + MTX group (descriptive p-value 0.0095 and 0.0287, respectively). 
Additionally, the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX treatment group had a greater proportion of patients achieving 
ACR/EULAR Index remission compared to placebo + MTX at Week 24 (descriptive p-value 0.0013). 
Table 21.  Percentage of Patients with CDAI Remission at Weeks 24 and 52 
The analysis of remission by CDAI, which does not include markers of inflammation, CRP and ESR, 
shows that the higher remission response rates for TCZ therapy compared to MTX alone are robust and 
not greatly influenced by acute phase reactants. The exploratory analysis of the proportion of patients

in CDAI remission at Week 24, found that a greater proportion achieved remission in all TCZ treatment 
groups compared with placebo + MTX (descriptive p-values <0.05).

Supportive studies 
Study WA17824 
Study WA17824 was a Phase III 24-week global study assessing the safety and efficacy of TCZ 8 
mg/kg + placebo MTX versus MTX + placebo TCZ, in patients with active RA. Data from the primary 
analysis at Week 24 have been submitted previously. 
Data from a subgroup of these patients with early RA (RA duration of ≤ 2 years at baseline, similar to 
the definition used in WA19926) were presented to provide supportive evidence of signs and symptoms 
efficacy in an early RA population. 
Study MRA012JP 
Study MRA012JP was conducted by co-development partner Chugai in Japan. It was designed to 
investigate whether TCZ (8 mg/kg) monotherapy provided radiographic and clinical benefit in patients 
with active RA who had an inadequate response to conventional DMARDs. Whilst conducted in a 
different patient population to the population studied in WA19926 (the median baseline duration of RA 
was 2 years in MRA012JP) this study provided supportive radiographic evidence of the efficacy of TCZ 
monotherapy. 
Study WA17823  
Study WA17823 was Phase III study assessing the safety and prevention of structural joint damage 
during treatment with TCZ (8mg/kg or 4 mg/kg) + MTX versus placebo + MTX in patients with 
moderate to severe active RA who had an inadequate response to MTX (MTX-IR). Data from study 
WA17823 were assessed previously. In the current submission LTE data are summarised.

Comparison of Study WA19926 and MRA012JP 
While study MRA012JP was not formally designed to examine patients with early RA, nevertheless, the 
mean duration of RA in this study was 2.3 years, with a median of 2.0 years, therefore half of the 
patients enrolled met the RA duration criterion used in WA19926 to define an early population. The 
majority of patients in MRA012JP had active RA disease, as evidenced by comparison of the mean 
baseline mTSS scores which were considerably higher than those recorded in WA19926 patients.

Additional analyses 
Long-term efficacy  
Historical long-term efficacy data are provided from 3 data sets: 
• 
LTE Early RA Subpopulation. The LTE All-Exposure population comprises data (cut-off date: 02 
May 2012) pooled from the 5 pivotal RA Phase III studies WA17822, WA17823, WA18063, 
WA17824, and WA18062, the safety study WP18663, the open label LTE clinical studies 
WA18695, WA18696, and 6-month data from the Phase IV TCZ monotherapy study WA19924. 
From this pooled population, data were assessed for all patients with ≤ 2 years since their RA 
diagnosis at the time they received their first dose of TCZ (“LTE Early RA subpopulation”). 
• 
• 
LTE Monotherapy Subgroup. Long term efficacy data (cut-off date: 02 May 2012) were 
assessed from patients in study WA17824 who received TCZ monotherapy and continued on 
TCZ monotherapy up to 6.6 years in the LTE study WA18696 (“LTE monotherapy subgroup”). 
Long-Term Patients in Study WA17823. Data up to Week 104 on prevention of structural joint 
damage were assessed for patients in Study WA17823, a Phase III study assessing the safety 
and prevention of structural joint damage during treatment with TCZ (8mg/kg or 4 mg/kg) + 
MTX versus placebo + MTX in patients with moderate to severe active RA who had an 
inadequate response to MTX (MTX-IR).

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study WA19926 was a multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, and parallel-group study of the safety, 
disease remission and prevention of structural joint damage during treatment with tocilizumab, as a 
monotherapy and in combination with methotrexate, versus methotrexate in patients with early, 
moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis.

The total study duration is 104 weeks. This submission was based on an interim analysis at week 52. 
The study is continuing in a blinded fashion into Year 2, and data from Week 104 will be reported at a 
later time. It has to be noted that such approach of interim analysis might jeopardise the further 
conduct of the blinded study and affect the integrity of study data in Year 2.  
The target population for this study was adult patients with moderate-to-severe active early RA who 
were naïve to treatment with both MTX and a biologic agent.  
The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with disease remission, defined as DAS28 < 2.6, 
at Week 24. Disease remission as the primary endpoint is in line with the current treatment targets for 
early RA patients. 
The sample size calculation is comprehensible and appropriate statistical methods were applied. 
However, from the sample size calculation in combination with the hierarchical testing procedure it 
appears that the interest in determining the effects of the TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX group was relatively  
low. 
There were two amendments of the protocol; which have no impact on the safety and efficacy analysis 
of the study. 
The primary analysis population for efficacy was the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which comprises 
all patients randomized into the study, provided at least one TCZ/placebo infusion was administered. 
Patients were assigned to treatment groups as randomized for analysis purposes. 
The design e.g. patient population and endpoints is largely in line with the Points to consider on clinical 
investigation of medicinal products other than NSAIDS for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
(CPMP/EWP/556/95 rev 1/Final).  
Treatment groups were balanced for the demographic characteristics sex, race, age, mean weight, 
height and mean body mass index (BMI). Slightly more patients in the placebo + MTX treatment group 
were non-Hispanic compared with the TCZ treatment groups (83% versus 76%−78%) and slightly 
fewer patients in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX group who were postmenopausal compared with the other 
three treatment groups (37% versus 45% TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX, 45% TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo and 42% 
placebo + MTX). However, these differences are not considered clinically meaningful. 
The treatment arms were well balanced with respect to RA disease characteristics. The mean and 
median duration of RA across treatment groups (0.4−0.5 years and 0.2−0.3 years, respectively) 
indicated that a very early RA population was recruited into the study. The overall oral corticosteroid 
use was also relatively low across all treatment arms. Slightly fewer patients in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + 
MTX group were using oral corticosteroids at baseline compared with the other three treatment groups. 
This difference is not considered clinically meaningful. The mean mTSS (Sharp-van der Heijde) was 
generally similar between all treatment groups at baseline. Of note, the mTSS observed at baseline 
were relatively low given that the target study population were patients with active, progressive RA, 
with erosions at baseline. This finding was consistent through all treatment groups. The low mTSS at 
baseline as well as the low percentage of patients using oral corticosteroids reflects suggests the 
inclusion of a very early treatment naïve RA population. The number of active joints elevated ESR or 
CRP, high HAQ-DI and VAS scores again indicated that the RA population recruited had active, 
progressive disease.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The study met its primary endpoint of proportion of patients with DAS28 remission (DAS< 2.6) with 
the primary treatment comparison being the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX treatment group versus the placebo 
+ MTX treatment group (44.8% versus 15.0%; OR = 4.77, 95% CI: 3.19 – 7.14; p < 0.0001). The 
RoActemra 
EMA/431298/2014 
Page 58/115 
  
 
 
proportion of patients in DAS28 remission in the TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX was numerically greater than in 
the placebo + MTX group (31.9% versus 15.0%; OR = 2.72;) however, this comparison fell after the 
hierarchical break in statistical testing.  
A clear separation between TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX and TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo compared with the 
placebo + MTX group was apparent by Week 4; while for the TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX a clear separation 
between TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX and placebo + MTX group was apparent by Week 8. To assess the 
maintenance of the effect of the DAS28 remission, an exploratory analysis of the proportion of DAS28 
remission responders at both Weeks 24 and 52 was performed. This showed that 79.2% of Week 24 
responders were still a DAS28 responder at Week 52 in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX group compared with 
55.8% in the placebo + MTX group. In all, 70.8% of patients in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo group 
maintained their response from Week 24 to Week 52 as did 76.1% of patients in the TCZ 4 mg/kg + 
MTX group.  
This positive result for the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX treatment group was supported by a predefined set of 
secondary analyses, controlling for multiple testing. 
It can be considered that early response is predictive to a certain extent for the treatment response to 
TCZ over time. The MAH is encouraged to attempt to determine baseline disease characteristics 
correlating with treatment response and maintenance of effect over time.  
Since the initiation of the WA19926 study, ACR and EULAR have introduced more stringent remission 
measures, and therefore ACR/EULAR Boolean and Index remission as well as CDAI remission (CDAI 
data not shown) was added as exploratory endpoints in WA19926. Fewer patients in all treatment 
groups achieved remission using the newer endpoints, especially ACR/EULAR Boolean remission, which 
is the most stringent measure. This finding is consistent with observation from Kuriya at al. (J 
Rheumatol 2012; 39: 1155–8) indicating that frequency of remission in early RA differs according to 
the remission definition applied. 
The ACR20, ACR50, ACR70 response rates were numerically higher for all TCZ groups in comparison 
with placebo + MTX, with the highest response rates seen in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX group. Similar 
results were seen at Week 52. 
TCZ treatment resulted in reduction of joint damage both in combination (8 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg) with 
MTX and as monotherapy, and this reduction was greater than achieved with MTX alone. This was 
shown in an exploratory analysis. The reduction of joint damage, was greater in all TCZ treatment 
groups of WA19926 compared to placebo + MTX at Week 52 as measured by lower change from 
baseline in mTSS, and Erosion and JSN scores. The differences in radiographic endpoints were 
statistically significant for the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX group compared with placebo +MTX. 
The study was not designed to demonstrate the efficacy of the TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX treatment in the 
hierarchical testing of the endpoints. However the data suggest that patients might experience a 
clinical benefit also for the lower TCZ dose. In the US, the recommended starting dose is 4 mg/kg IV 
followed by an increase to 8 mg/kg based on clinical response. In future, a comparative analysis of 
data from the EU and US registry could provide further information on the efficacy of the lower dose 
regimen. The MAH is encouraged to conduct such analysis when possible. 
Of note, analysis of the exposure vs. DAS28 remission showed similar remission rates in quartile 3 and 
quartile 4 for patients treated with 8mg/kg, suggesting that these patients already in quartile 3 were 
on plateau in respect of efficacy. 
The efficacy findings of study WA19926 were further supported by data from previous studies. Analysis 
of efficacy in the early RA subpopulation from study WA17824, and demonstrated the efficacy of TCZ 
at improving RA signs and symptoms in patients with early RA; e.g. the proportion of DAS28 remission

responders, the ACR20/50/70 response rates were consistently higher in TCZ-treated patients than in 
patients who received MTX. 
Regarding the reduction of structural joint damage progression, the results observed in WA19926 are 
consistent with one year radiographic results from a subset of patients with early RA included in the 
Japanese TCZ monotherapy study MRA012JP. 
Long-term data beyond Week 52 are not available for Study WA19926 yet. An analysis of long-term 
efficacy of TCZ in early RA patients was conducted on the all-exposure LTE data set. These data 
showed that early RA patients as well as patients treated with TCZ monotherapy, who continued to 
receive TCZ 8 mg/kg up to 6 years, could maintain clinical benefit for a prolonged period of time. The 
final Week 104 data for Study WA19926 are expected and the CHMP recommends submitting those 
date when available. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The pivotal study met its target: The proportion of patients in DAS28 remission at Week 24 was 
significantly higher in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX group than in the placebo + MTX group (44.8% versus 
15.0%; OR = 4.77, 95%-CI: 3.19 – 7.14; p < 0.0001). 
The study was not designed to formally demonstrate the efficacy of the TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX treatment 
due to the hierarchical testing of the endpoints. Week 52 and preliminary week 104 data already 
showed that clinical benefit was also observed with the TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX dose, although at lower 
rate than for the TCZ 8 mg +MTX group. 
Exploratory analysis revealed that TCZ treatment results in reduction of joint damage both in 
combination (8 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg) with MTX and as monotherapy, and this reduction was greater 
than achieved with MTX alone. 
An analysis of long-term efficacy of TCZ in early RA patients was conducted on the all-exposure LTE 
data set. These data showed that early RA patients as well as patients treated with TCZ monotherapy, 
who continued to receive TCZ 8 mg/kg up to 6 years, could maintain clinical benefit for a prolonged 
period of time. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The safety analysis population included all patients who received at least one TCZ/placebo infusion and 
had at least one post-dose safety assessment. Patients were assigned to treatment groups as treated. 
The 5 patients who did not receive any study drug and 4 patients who had no post-baseline safety data 
(3 [placebo + MTX] and 1 [TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX]) were excluded from the safety population. 
At the baseline visit, 2 patients randomized to the placebo + MTX group erroneously received one vial 
of TCZ during IV administration and were therefore allocated to the TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX group for 
safety analysis. The total safety population comprised 1153 patients.

Table 33.  Analysis Population by Actually Received Study Treatment (All Patients Population) 
The majority of randomized patients completed 52 weeks of participation in the study (the median 
extent of exposure was 1.0 year), and were exposed to the planned cumulative dose of IV treatment 
(placebo or TCZ). The total number of PYs of exposure tocilizumab (the sum of the exposure to IV 
treatment for all patients) was similar across treatment groups (ranging between 249.2 and 260.6 PY).  
Table 34.  Exposure to IV Treatment (Safety Population) 
Adverse events 
The number of patients who experienced at least one AE was similar between TCZ and placebo + MTX 
treatment groups (88.3% [TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX]; 85.6% [TCZ 8mg/kg + placebo]; 88.6% [4 mg/kg + 
MTX]; and 83.3% [placebo + MTX]). However, the total number of AEs was slightly higher in the TCZ 
8mg/kg + MTX and TCZ 4kg/kg + MTX combination groups compared with TCZ 8 mg/kg monotherapy 
and placebo + MTX groups. 
The rate of AEs (per 100-PY) in the TCZ + MTX combination therapy groups were also slightly higher 
than in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo and placebo + MTX groups (434.1 [95% CI: 409.2, 460.0] TCZ 8 
mg/kg + MTX; 394.1 [95% CI: 370.7, 418.5] TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo; 444.3 [95% CI: 419.2, 470.5] 
TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX; and 405.7 [95% CI: 381.3, 431.2] in the placebo + MTX group).

Page 61/115 
  
 
 
  
  
Table 35.  AEs with an Incidence of at Least 3% by Preferred Term (Safety Population) 
The highest AE rate per 100-PY was seen in the SOC of infections and infestations (highest rate for 
upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis), followed by gastrointestinal disorders (highest 
rates for nausea and diarrhoea), and investigations (highest rates for of aminotransferase and 
transaminase increase). 
The rates of AEs (per 100-PY) considered by the investigator to be related (remotely, possibly, or 
probably related) to treatment were similar in TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX and TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX treatment 
groups (225.8 [95% CI: 208.0,244.7], and 232.0 [95% CI: 214.0,251.1], respectively); these rates 
were comparatively higher than the rates observed in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo and placebo + MTX 
treatment groups (182.9 [95% CI:167.1,199.8] and 164.0 [95% CI: 148.6,180.5], respectively). The 
most frequently reported treatment-related AEs occurred in the SOCs of Infections and Infestations, 
followed by Gastrointestinal Disorders and Investigations.

EMA/431298/2014 
Page 62/115 
  
 
 
  
Table 36.  Rate of Adverse Events per 100 Patient Years by Intensity (Safety Population) 
The intensity of AEs was judged by the investigator to be mild, moderate, or severe. The majority of 
AEs (96%− 98% across all four treatment groups) were mild or moderate in intensity. A higher rate of 
moderate AEs in the TCZ 8 mg/kg +MTX group and a higher rate of severe AEs in the TCZ 4 mg/kg 
+MTX group were observed.  
The most common SOCs in which severe AEs were reported were Infections and Infestations followed 
by Gastrointestinal Disorders and Investigations. 
Serious adverse events, deaths, other significant events 
Deaths 
Nine deaths were reported up to Week 52 (2 [TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX]; 1 [TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo]; 4 
[TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX]; and 2 [placebo + MTX]). 
Overall, the rate of deaths (per 100-PY) in the TCZ groups was similar to that seen in the placebo + 
MTX group, with the exception of the TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX group. The slightly higher rate of deaths in 
the TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX group compared with the other TCZ groups and placebo + MTX group was 
driven by a very small number of deaths. 
The underlying cause of death was variable across treatment groups. Additionally, there was no 
pattern in the underlying cause of death in the TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX group; however, three of the four 
deaths reported in this group occurred in patients who were > 80 years old. 
Serious adverse events 
The proportions of patients who experienced at least one SAE was similar between the study groups 
(10.7% [TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX]; 8.6% [TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo]; 10.0% [TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX]; and 
8.5% [placebo + MTX]). The rate of SAEs (per 100-PY) was slightly higher for the TCZ + MTX 
combination groups (13.3 [TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX] and 15.9 [TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX compared with 10.4 
[TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo] and 10.6 [placebo + MTX] groups). 
RoActemra 
EMA/431298/2014 
Page 63/115 
  
 
 
 
The majority of SAEs were judged by the investigator as being unrelated to study treatment. A small 
proportion of patients had at least one related SAE (2.8% [TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX]; 1.4% [TCZ 8 mg/kg 
+ placebo]; 4.8% [TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX]; and 2.1% [placebo + MTX]). 
Infections and infestations were the most frequently reported SAEs followed by neoplasms, benign, 
malignant, and unspecified (including cysts and polyps), and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal 
disorders. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events and dose interruptions 
In total, 149 patients withdrew prematurely from study treatment due to an AE (including SAEs). 
The rates of AEs leading to withdrawal per 100-PY of exposure was higher in the TCZ treatment groups 
(TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX: 22.5 [95% CI: 17.1, 29.0]; TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo: 12.7 [95% CI: 8.8, 17.7]; 
TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX: 13.3 [95% CI: 9.2, 18.5]) compared with placebo + MTX (8.2 [95% CI: 5.1, 
12.6]). 
The rate of AEs leading to withdrawal decreased over time for all treatment groups; and the majority 
were observed within the first 24 weeks of treatment in the TCZ treatment groups (TCZ 8 mg/kg + 
MTX, TCZ 8m/kg monotherapy, and TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX) and within the first 12 week of treatment in 
the placebo + MTX group. 
In all three TCZ treatment groups, the most common reasons for treatment discontinuation were 
attributed to the Investigations SOC, in particular events related to liver enzyme elevations (most 
common PTs in TCZ treatment groups: alanine aminotransferase increased [reported in 27 patients], 
transaminases increased [22 patients], and aspartate aminotransferase increased [4 patients]). 
After investigations, infections were the most frequently reported reason for study withdrawal. A 
similar number of patients in each treatment group withdrew from the study due to an infection. There 
were 6 patients in the TCZ 8mg/kg + MTX group (2 patients withdrawn due to Herpes zoster, and 1 
patients each withdrawn due to arthritis bacterial, cellulitis, Staphylococcal infection, or tuberculosis); 
1 patient in the TCZ 8mg/kg + placebo group (withdrawn due to folliculitis); 4 patients in the TCZ 
4mg/kg + MTX (withdrawn due to pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, lung infection, or urinary tract 
infection); and 4 patients in placebo + MTX (withdrawn due to pneumonia, pneumonia, influenza, 
sepsis, or tooth abscess). 
Patients in all four treatment groups experienced dose modifications/interruptions due to AEs. The 
incidence was higher with TCZ combination therapy (171 of 290 patients [59.0%] in TCZ 8 mg/kg + 
MTX; 153 of 289 patients [52.9%] in TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX) compared with placebo + MTX (134 of 282 
patients [47.5%]); whereas, the incidence in TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo (128 of 292 patients [43.8%] 
was lower than placebo + MTX. 
The most common AEs leading to dose interruptions/modification were in the Investigations SOC (most 
frequently, alanine aminotransferase increased, transaminases increased, and aspartate 
aminotransferase increased), with the rate being highest in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX group (48.4 per 
100-PY [95% CI: 40.3, 57.5]), and lowest in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo group (19.4 per 100-PY [95% 
CI: 14.5, 25.4]. The rate of Investigations AEs leading to dose modification/interruption was similar 
between TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX and placebo + MTX (31.1 per 100-PY [95% CI: 24.7, 38.6], and 24.7 per 
100-PY [195% CI: 9.0, 31.6]). 
Infections and infestations were the next most frequent cause of dose interruptions/ modifications 
(with rates being similar across all groups, although numerically higher in the TCZ treatment groups), 
followed by gastrointestinal disorders (similarly common between TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX, TCZ 4 mg/kg + 
MTX and placebo + MTX, with a lower rate in TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo).

Adverse events of special interest 
AESIs, predefined on the basis of findings from previous clinical studies, safety concerns for the RA 
population, as well as on the safety profile of other biologic agents used to treat RA, were: infections 
(including opportunistic infections), GI perforations, demyelinating disorders, hepatic events, 
myocardial infarction, stroke, malignancies, anaphylactic reactions, hypersensitivity, and bleeding 
events. 
Table 37.  Overview of Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Infections 
Infections and infestations were the most frequently reported AEs and SAEs in the study. 
The overall incidence of infections was similar between the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX, TCZ 8 mg/kg + 
placebo, and placebo + MTX treatment groups; the incidence of infections in the TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX 
group was numerically higher than the other groups. This same pattern was seen when rates were 
adjusted for exposure. Analysing infection rates by 12-week intervals revealed that for all treatment 
groups, rates were consistent over time and did not appear to increase with exposure. 
The most common types of infections across all treatment groups were upper respiratory tract 
infections, nasopharyngitis, and urinary tract infections. The incidence of these infections in both TCZ 8 
mg/kg treatment groups was similar to that observed in the placebo + MTX groups. 
The majority of infections were of mild or moderate intensity. Infections of severe intensity were rare, 
but were more common in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX and TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX treatment groups 
compared with placebo + MTX (8 [TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX], 6 [TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo], 11 [TCZ 4 mg/kg 
+ MTX], and 5 patients in the [placebo + MTX] group). 
RoActemra 
EMA/431298/2014

Serious infections were infrequent in all three TCZ treatment groups. Thirty-five serious infections were 
experienced by 35 patients in the safety population. Serious infections were more common in the TCZ 
treatment groups compared with placebo + MTX.  
The most common serious infection was pneumonia. Serious pneumonias were most common in the 
TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX group (6 patients [2.1%]); the incidence of serious pneumonias in TCZ 8 mg/kg 
+ MTX (2 patients [0.7%]) and TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo (1 patient [0.3%]) were similar to placebo + 
MTX (3 patients [1.1%].  
There were five infections that led to death: lung neoplasm/pneumonia (TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo), lung 
infection and pneumonia/malnutrition (TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX), sepsis and pneumonia influenza (placebo 
+ MTX). 
No opportunistic infections were reported in this study up to Week 52. 
One case of tuberculosis (TB) was reported in a 64-year-old female from Italy in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + 
MTX group (Patient 205655/17762). This was a new diagnosis of pulmonary TB, and the patient was 
reportedly exposed via her husband who had active TB. 
Myocardial Infarction (MI) 
The incidence of serious MI events in all treatment groups was low: 1 patient (0.3%) developed an MI 
in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX group, 1 patient (0.3%) in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo group, and 3 
patients (1.0%) in the TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX group. There were no MIs reported in the placebo + MTX 
treatment group. 
Stroke 
The incidence of serious stroke events in all treatment groups was low, with four events reported up to 
Week 52. Two patients (0.7%) had a stroke in the TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX group, with an additional 2 
patients (0.7%) who had a stroke in the placebo + MTX group. No strokes were reported for patients 
in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX or TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo treatment groups. 
Malignancies 
In total, 13 patients experienced 13 malignancies up to Week 52 of the study, with the incidence being 
similarly low across all treatment groups: 3 (1.0%) occurred in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX group, 3 
(1.0%) in TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo, 4 (1.4%) in TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX, and 3 (1.1%) in the placebo + 
MTX group. Three of these events were reported as non-serious AEs (two cases of basal cell 
carcinoma, one each in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX and TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo groups, and one case of 
breast cancer in situ in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX group). 
Five malignancies were also reported early in the study (prior to study Day 50). 
Hypersensitivity AEs 
Hypersensitivity reactions were identified as events that occurred during or within 24 hours of an 
infusion, excluding events that were not deemed unrelated to treatment. A conservative approach was 
taken to identify potential hypersensitivity reactions and this retrieval included all AEs, regardless of 
whether or not they were clinically consistent with hypersensitivity. 
Potential hypersensitivity reactions were observed at a higher frequency in the TCZ treatment groups 
(TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX: 17.6% [51 of 290 patients]; TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo: 15.4% [45 of 292 
RoActemra 
EMA/431298/2014 
Page 66/115 
  
 
 
patients]; TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX: 20.4% [59 of 289 patients], compared with placebo + MTX (13.8% 
[39 of 282 patients]) 
Serious hypersensitivity /anaphylactic reactions 
Serious hypersensitivity events were defined as SAEs that occurred during or within 24 hours of an 
infusion, excluding events that were not deemed to be unrelated to study treatment. Using this 
definition, the incidence was rare, with a total of 4 patients (1 patients [0.3%] in TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX, 
2 [0.7%] in TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo, 1 [0.3%] in TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX) experiencing four serious 
hypersensitivity events. Two of these were not clinically consistent with hypersensitivity (pneumococcal 
infection and increased transaminase). Excluding these there were 2 patients who experienced a 
serious hypersensitive. One patient was identified as having an anaphylactic reaction. This patient was 
negative for anti-TCZ antibodies in the confirmatory assay both at baseline and post-baseline. The 
second patient was reported to experience “infusion-related reaction”; the signs and symptoms were 
consistent anaphylactic reaction. 
Bleeding Events 
The incidence of serious bleeding events in all treatment groups was low, with six events experienced 
by 6 patients up to Week 52.  
Serious bleeding events were not associated with low platelet counts. Two patients (0.7%) in the TCZ 
8 mg/kg + MTX group, 1 patient (0.3%) in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo group, 2 patients (0.7%) in the 
TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX group and 1 patient (0.4%) in the placebo + MTX group reported a serious 
bleeding event. 
Two of the bleeding events were a result of accidental falls Two of the events were GI haemorrhages 
(1 patient in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX group had predisposing risk factors and 1 patient in placebo + 
MTX did not). One patient in the TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX group died as the result of the bleeding event of 
cerebral haemorrhage.  
Pregnancy 
Seven cases of pregnancy were reported in the study up to Week 52.  
Three pregnancies were reported in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX group, which resulted in patient 
discontinuation from treatment. Of the three cases, one case of pregnancy ended in spontaneous 
abortion (approximately 40 days into the pregnancy); two cases were ongoing at the time of data 
reporting. 
Four pregnancies were reported in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo group. Two cases of pregnancy resulted 
in discontinuation of study treatment; one case ended in a spontaneous abortion (duration of 
pregnancy was not known) and the other was still ongoing at the time of data reporting. Two cases of 
pregnancy resulted in in dosage modification; both cases ended in elective abortion (approximately 2 
months and approximately 45 days into the pregnancy).

Laboratory findings 
Neutropenia and abnormal neutrophil count 
Figure 17.  Mean (± SEM) Neutrophils Counts (109/L) by Visit (Safety Population) 
Mean neutrophil counts were within normal range and similar between the TCZ treatment groups and 
the placebo + MTX group at baseline. In all groups (including placebo + MTX), there was a decrease in 
mean neutrophil levels after initiation of treatment that continued to Week 12. Thereafter neutrophil 
counts became relatively stable at levels below baseline values, but still within the normal range. The 
greatest changes were seen in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX and TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo groups, while the 
decrease observed in the TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX group was similar to that in the placebo + MTX group. 
Table 38.  Worst NCI CTCAE Grades for Neutrophil Counts (Safety Population) 
Neutrophil counts remained within normal range for 63.8% of patients in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX 
group, 70.5% of patients in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo group, 84.8% of patients in the TCZ 4 mg/kg 
+ MTX group and 92.9% of patients in the placebo + MTX group. The majority of abnormalities 
RoActemra 
EMA/431298/2014

reported across all four treatment groups were Grade 1 and Grade 2 decreases. Grade 3 decreases 
were also observed in all treatment groups, but at a higher incidence in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX and 
TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo groups. The majority of Grade 3 decreases occurred at a single time point 
only. One Grade 4 decrease was observed in TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo group.  
There were 28 events of AEs defined as neutropenia in the study (7 [TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX], 6 [TCZ 4 
mg/kg + MTX], 12 [TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo] and 3 [placebo + MTX]). These events of neutropenia 
were not associated with concurrent (defined as occurring within a 30-day window) serious infections, 
except for 1 patient in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo group. The patient developed neutropenia on study 
Day 29 (neutrophil count 1.67 × 109/L) and subsequently developed an SAE of viral infection 
(manifesting as urticarial rash) on study Day 55. Study drug was temporarily interrupted and the 
patient’s neutrophil levels normalized by study Day 71. The SAE resolved without sequelae and the 
patient continued in the study.  
Six patients treated with MTX + placebo and 10 patients treated with TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX, reported 
serious infections; none had low neutrophil counts occurring within 30 days of the infection. 
Eleven patients treated with TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX reported serious infections, of which, 3 patients had 
low neutrophil levels occurring at any time during the study, and 1 of these patients (pneumonia 
bacterial) had low neutrophils within 30 days of the SAE.  
Eight patients treated with TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo reported serious infections, of which 4 patients had 
low neutrophil levels occurring at any time during the study, and 2 of these patients had low 
neutrophils within 30 days of the event. 
Platelet counts 
Platelet counts remained within normal range for most patients in all treatment groups (90.8%−97.5% 
of patients across treatment groups) 
Post-treatment, in platelet counts was observed in all treatment groups; however, the magnitude of 
change was more pronounced in the TCZ treatment groups compared with the placebo + MTX group.  
There were 6 patients with AEs classified as thrombocytopenia in the study (2 [TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX], 1 
[TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX], 2 [TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo] and 1 [placebo + MTX]); none were associated 
with a bleeding event. None of the reported bleeding AEs were associated with platelet counts below 
the normal range. 
Hepatic events and liver function test parameters 
No serious hepatic events were reported.

Table 39.   Transaminase and Total Bilirubin Shifts from Normal at Baseline to Worst Post-
baseline Value (WA19926 Safety Population) 
After initiation of treatment there was an increase in mean ALT and AST levels in all four treatment 
groups. The majority of ALT/AST shifts from normal baseline levels in all three populations were from 
>ULN to ≤ 3 ×ULN. 
Mean total bilirubin levels increased in all four treatment groups after initiation of treatment, but 
remained within the normal range throughout the study period. 
Lipid parameters 
Mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were 
increased above baseline by the first assessment at Week 8 and remained stable thereafter at the 
higher level. 
Analysis of LDL cholesterol levels according to the ATP III thresholds showed that the majority of 
patients maintained their baseline LDL cholesterol levels at the last observation. Increases in LDL 
cholesterol levels from < 160 mg/dL at baseline to ≥ 160 mg/dL at the last observation were more 
frequent in the TCZ treatment arms than in the placebo + MTX group. The greatest incidence of shifts 
to ≥160 mg/dL was observed in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo group followed by the TCZ 8 mg/kg + 
MTX and the TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX groups. 
As with LDL cholesterol, the majority of patients maintained baseline total cholesterol levels at the last 
observation. The pattern of shifts in total cholesterol from levels < 240 mg/dL at baseline to ≥ 240 
mg/dL at the last observation followed the same trend as that for LDL cholesterol. 
Similarly, for HDL cholesterol, the majority of patients maintained baseline cholesterol levels at the last 
observation. However, the proportion of patients with baseline HDL levels in each ATP III category was 
more widely distributed, and approximately a third of all patients had baseline levels in the highest 
category of > 60 mg/dL. Increases from < 60 mg/dL at baseline to ≥ 60 mg/dL at the last observation 
were more frequent in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX and TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX groups than in the placebo + 
MTX and the TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo groups. 
The majority of patients maintained baseline triglycerides levels at last observation. The majority of 
patients had triglyceride levels in the lowest ATP III category of <150 mg/dL at baseline. Increases 
from <150 mg/dL to ≥150 mg/dL at the last observation were observed, with a greater incidence in 
the TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo group followed by the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX group 
Of the patients who were not taking lipid-lowering agents at baseline, the proportion of patients who 
initiated lipid-lowering treatments during the first 52 weeks of the study (including treatments in the 
RoActemra

following classes: statins, fibrates and lipid regulating agents) was as follows: 3.9% on placebo + MTX, 
3.5% on TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX, 5.2% on TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX, and 7.5% on TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo. 
Immunogenicity 
During the 52-week treatment period, the percentage of patients who developed anti-TCZ antibodies 
(positive in both the screening and the confirmation assay post-baseline, and confirmation assay 
negative at baseline) was low (≤ 2.2%) and similar between the TCZ treatment groups (1.4% [TCZ 8 
mg/kg + MTX], 1.1% [TCZ 8mg/kg + placebo] and 2.2% [TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX]). 
Additionally, 3.2% of the patients in the placebo + MTX group tested positive in the confirmation assay 
post-baseline (after negative confirmation assay results at baseline). Since patients in the placebo + 
MTX group had never been treated with TCZ, they could not have developed anti-TCZ antibodies and 
hence, these results are considered to be false positives. Please refer also to Clinical Pharmacology 
section of this report for detailed results and discussion on immunogenicity. 
No patients with an anaphylactic reaction or severe hypersensitivity developed anti−TCZ antibodies.  
Eleven patients in the TCZ treatment groups developed neutralizing anti-TCZ antibodies. None of them 
withdrew due to lack of efficacy or were classified as non-responders.  
Further, no patient who withdrew due to lack of efficacy, or who was classified as having experienced 
loss of efficacy, developed neutralizing anti-TCZ antibodies.  
Additional analysis 
Adverse Events by Cmin Exposure Quartiles at Week 24 
The relationship between rates of all AEs and rates of infections and observed Cmin at Week 24 was 
analysed and has been presented in PK section of this report. There was no clear trend for an increase 
in the incidence of total AEs or infections when Cmin increased across quartiles, with the exception of a 
higher incidence rate for total AEs and infections in the fourth quartile of the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX 
group compared to the other quartiles in this group.

Post marketing experience 
A summary of the post-marketing experience with TCZ based on safety data submitted previously in 
PSUR covering the period from 11 April 2005 up to 10 October 2012 the end of the reporting period for 
the most recent PSUR was provided. Since initial market approval in Japan on 11 April 2005 and until 
the end of the reporting period for the most recent periodic safety update report (PSUR), TCZ has been 
approved for use in over 100 countries, including the European Union and the United States of 
America. 
During the period of the most recent PSUR, the estimated exposure to TCZ across all indications, via 
commercially obtained drug and through clinical trials, was 46,521 patients. The estimated cumulative 
exposure to TCZ since 11 April 2005, via commercially obtained drug and through clinical trials until 10 
October 2012, was 184,398 patients. 
At the data lock point of the latest PSUR, a cumulative total of 19,281 AE cases, involving 37,750 AEs 
had been recorded on the MAH’s Global Safety Database. Of these, 9,776 cases, involving 21,264 AEs, 
were medically confirmed cases. These figures include spontaneously reported cases that had only 
non-serious listed events. Excluding such cases, a total of 8,435 medically-confirmed cases, involving 
19,524 AEs, have been recorded. 
RoActemra 
EMA/431298/2014 
Page 72/115 
  
 
 
 
 
During the reporting period for the latest PSUR, the marketing authorization holder received a total of 
1,696 medically-confirmed cases containing 3,633 AEs. These events occurred in 1,689 patients. Of 
the 1,696 cases, 1,442 were serious with a total of 2,393 of the events categorized as SAEs. This 
figure of 1,696 medically-confirmed cases excludes spontaneous cases containing only non-serious 
listed events, of which there were 214 cases involving 257 AEs. 
One hundred and ten fatal cases were received during the reporting period. 
The most frequently reported AEs were within the SOCs “Infections and Infestations” (21.3% of total 
AEs), “General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions” (10.7% of total AEs), and 
“Gastrointestinal Disorder” (9.5% of total AEs). 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety assessment of TCZ in early RA is based on the pivotal Study WA19926. In this double blind 
placebo controlled study patients receiving two different doses of TCZ (8 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg) were 
evaluated in combination with MTX and the TCZ 8 mg/kg regimen was also evaluated as a 
monotherapy.  
In the pivotal study the safety population included a total of 1153 patients; of these 871 patients 
received TCZ (all TCZ-population) and 282 patients received placebo. This corresponds to a cumulative 
exposure in study of 254.9 PY for the placebo group and of 794.9 PY for the All-TCZ population.  
For a comparative analysis of the pooled TCZ patients in study WA19926 the following other RA safety 
populations are relevant: 
•  Controlled DMARD-IR population: pooled safety data from DMARD-IR patients from the placebo-
controlled period of 3 studies: 24 weeks in WA17822 and WA18063, and 52 weeks in WA17823. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Long Term Extension (LTE) All-exposure Population: the updated assessment of the ongoing LTE 
studies of IV TCZ in adult RA patients with a clinical data cut off of May 2012. 
LTE MTX-naïve subpopulation: LTE data from the subpopulation of patients who were MTX-naïve or 
who had not received MTX for 6 months prior to the core study WA17824. 
LTE early RA subpopulation: LTE data for patients starting TCZ with ≤ 2 years since their RA 
diagnosis. 
LTE monotherapy subgroup: LTE data from patients from the WA17824 study in which patients 
received TCZ monotherapy.  
The rate of all AEs in Study WA19926 was higher than the corresponding rates for of all AEs in the LTE 
All-exposure population. However, in the initial 6 months of treatment for the LTE All-exposure 
population, this all AE rate was considerably higher (480.66 events per 100 PY [95% CI: 470.80, 
490.69]) and more comparable to the rates observed in the WA19926 study (423.9 events per 100 PY 
[95% CI: 409.8, 438.5]). The same pattern of event rates vs. study WA19926 data was also seen for 
the LTE MTX-naïve and LTE early RA subpopulations and the LTE monotherapy subgroup. The rates of 
all AEs decreased over time in the LTE All-exposure population as well as in the various subpopulations 
(LTE MTX-naïve, LTE early RA, LTE monotherapy subgroup). 
The majority of AEs (96% − 98% across all four treatment groups) were mild or moderate in intensity. 
The most common AE was seen infections and infestations (highest rate for upper respiratory tract 
infection and nasopharyngitis), followed by gastrointestinal disorders (highest rates for nausea and 
diarrhoea), and investigations (highest rates for of aminotransferase and transaminase increase). 
RoActemra 
EMA/431298/2014 
Page 73/115 
  
 
 
No new safety signals were detected in Study WA19926. 
There were nine deaths reported up to Week 52 in Study WA1992; the rate of deaths (per 100-PY) in 
the TCZ groups was similar to that seen in the placebo + MTX group, however a slightly higher rate of 
deaths in the TCZ 4 mg/kg was observed. Overall the death rate observed in study WA19926 was 
slightly higher than that observed in the controlled DMARD-IR population, as well as the LTE All-
Exposure, LTE MTX-naïve and LTE early RA populations, with the CIs overlapping. 
The underlying cause of death in Study WA1992 was variable across treatment groups; no pattern in 
the cause of death was observed. Of note, three of the four deaths in the TCZ 4 mg group were 
reported in patients who were > 80 years old. This might suggest that inclusion of more vulnerable 
patients in the clinical study might have introduced a bias. Patients with current or previous (within 
past years) evidence of serious uncontrolled concomitant diseases (e.g. cardiovascular, pulmonary, 
endocrine) were excluded from the study. Furthermore patients with evidence of active malignant 
disease were also excluded from the study. The patient’s narratives suggest that the exclusion criteria 
might not have been respected in this regard. 
The proportions of patients in Study WA19926 who experienced at least one SAE was similar between 
the study groups. The rate of SAEs (per 100-PY) was slightly higher for the TCZ + MTX combination 
groups than for the placebo group; the CIs were overlapping. The majority of SAEs were judged by the 
investigator as being unrelated to study treatment. Infections and infestations were the most 
frequently reported SAEs followed by neoplasms, benign, malignant, and unspecified (including cysts 
and polyps), and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.  
The observed SAE rates in Study WA19926 were consistent with data reported in the DMARD-IR 
population in previous studies as well as with LTE data form IV TCZ studies. Consistent with data from 
these studies, the most frequent SOC affected by SAEs in the WA19926 was “Infections and 
Infestations”. The other SOCs frequently affected with SAEs in study WA19926 also showed a similar 
pattern of distribution as was observed in other TCZ-treated populations.  
Adverse events of special interest predefined on the basis of findings from previous clinical studies, 
safety concerns for the RA population, as well as on the safety profile of other biologic agents used to 
treat RA, were: infections (including opportunistic infections), GI perforations, demyelinating disorders, 
hepatic events, myocardial infarction, stroke, malignancies, anaphylactic reactions, hypersensitivity, 
and bleeding events.  
The overall incidence of infections in Study WA19926 was similar between the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX, 
TCZ 8 mg/kg + placebo, and placebo + MTX treatment groups; the incidence of infections in the TCZ 4 
mg/kg + MTX group was numerically higher than the other groups. Infection rates in study WA19926 
were stable over the 52-week study period and did not appear to increase with exposure. This finding 
is consistent with the LTE data, suggesting there is no evidence of an increasing risk of infection over 
time with TCZ treatment. 
Serious infections were infrequent in all three TCZ treatment groups. Serious infections were more 
common in the TCZ treatment groups compared with placebo + MTX. Overall, the pattern of serious 
infection rates in study WA19926 was similar to that previously observed in the controlled DMARD-IR 
population and LTE data.  
No opportunistic infections were reported in this study up to Week 52. 
The rate of serious hypersensitivity events in the All-TCZ group in study WA19926 was low and similar 
to the rates observed in the All-TCZ group in the controlled DMARD-IR population and in Month 0-6 of 
treatment in the LTE All-exposure population. The rate of anaphylaxis events in study WA19926 was 
RoActemra 
EMA/431298/2014 
Page 74/115 
  
 
 
also low and again similar to that previously observed with TCZ treatment in both the controlled 
DMARD-IR population and the LTE All-exposure population.  
Further events defined as events of special interest such as gastrointestinal perforation, demyelination 
disorders, hepatic events, myocardial infarction, stroke and bleeding events either did not occur or 
occurred at a low frequency in ALL-TCZ population in Study WA19926.  
The types of AESIs reported in Study WA19926 are consistent with the known safety profile of TCZ. 
In Study WA19926 in all groups (including placebo + MTX) there was a decrease in mean neutrophil 
levels after initiation of treatment that continued to Week 12. Thereafter neutrophil counts became 
relatively stable at levels below baseline values, but still within the normal range. The greatest changes 
were seen in the TCZ 8 mg/kg groups while the decrease observed in the TCZ 4 mg/kg group was 
similar to that in the placebo group. None of the patients with serious infections reported low 
neutrophil counts occurring within 30 days of the infection.  
In Study WA19926 the percentage of patients who developed anti-TCZ antibodies (positive in both the 
screening and the confirmation assay post-baseline, and confirmation assay negative at baseline) was 
low. There was no relationship between anti-TCZ antibody development and clinical AEs in study 
WA19926. None of the patients in the TCZ treatment groups who developed neutralizing anti-TCZ 
antibodies withdrew due to lack of efficacy or were classified as non-responders. 
The relationship between rates of all AEs and rates of infections and observed Cmin at Week 24 was 
analysed. There was no clear trend for an increase in the incidence of total AEs or infections when Cmin 
increased across quartiles, with the exception of a higher incidence rate for total AEs and infections in 
the fourth quartile of the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX group compared to the other quartiles in this group. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The unfavourable effects of TCZ are established and include infection, allergic reactions including 
anaphylaxis, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, AST/ALT/bilirubin elevation and 
hypercholesterolaemia. In general, the safety data from study WA19926 are consistent with the 
established safety profile of TCZ in adult RA. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The annex II related to the PSUR refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged.  
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: The PRAC 
considered that the risk management system version 16.0 could be acceptable with revisions required 
as described in the PRAC endorsed PRAC Rapporteur assessment report.

SPC 
SPC Section 4.3 Contraindications Active,

SPC section 4.4 Special warnings and 
precautions for use  
Infections 
Serious and sometimes fatal infections 
have been reported in patients receiving 
immunosuppressive agents including 
RoActemra (see section 4.8, Undesirable 
eEffects). RoActemra treatment should 
not be initiated in patients with active 
infections (see section 4.3). 
Administration of RoActemra should be 
interrupted if a patient develops a serious 
infection until the infection is controlled 
(see section 4.8). Healthcare professionals 
should exercise caution when considering 
the use of RoActemra in patients with a 
history of recurring or chronic infections or 
with underlying conditions (e.g. 
diverticulitis, diabetes, and interstitial lung 
disease) which may predispose patients to 
infections.  
Vigilance for the timely detection of 
serious infection is recommended for 
patients receiving biological treatments for 
moderate to severe RA as signs and 
symptoms of acute inflammation may be 
lessened, associated with suppression of 
the acute phase reactants. The effects of 
tocilizumab on C reactive protein (CRP), 
neutrophils and signs and symptoms of 
infection should be considered when 
evaluating a patient for a potential 
infection. Patients should be instructed to 
contact their healthcare professional 
immediately when any symptoms 
suggesting infection appear, in order to 
assure rapid evaluation and appropriate 
treatment. 
Tuberculosis  
As recommended for other biological 
treatments, RA sJIA and pJIA patients 
should be screened for latent tuberculosis 
(TB) infection prior to starting RoActemra 
therapy. Patients with latent TB should be 
treated with standard anti mycobacterial 
therapy before initiating RoActemra. 
RoActemra 
EMA/431298/2014

Prescribers are reminded of the risk of 
false negative tuberculin skin and 
interferon-gamma TB blood test results, 
especially in patients who are severely ill 
or immunocompromised.  
Patients should be instructed to seek 
medical advice if signs/symptoms (e.g., 
persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low 
grade fever) suggestive of a tuberculosis 
infection occur during or after therapy 
with RoActemra.   
SPC section 4.8 Undesirable effects 
Infections  
In the 6-month controlled studies the rate 
of all infections reported with tocilizumab 
8 mg/kg plus DMARD treatment was 127 
events per 100 patient years compared to 
112 events per 100 patient years in the 
placebo plus DMARD group. In the long 
term exposure population, the overall rate 
of infections with RoActemra was 108 
events per 100 patient years exposure. 
In 6-month controlled clinical studies, the 
rate of serious infections with tocilizumab 
8 mg/kg plus DMARDs was 5.3 events per 
100 patient years exposure compared to 
3.9 events per 100 patient years exposure 
in the placebo plus DMARD group. In the 
monotherapy study the rate of serious 
infections was 3.6 events per 100 patient 
years of exposure in the tocilizumab group 
and 1.5 events per 100 patient years of 
exposure in the MTX group.  
In the long term exposure population, the 
overall rate of serious infections 
(bacterial, viral and fungal) was 4.7 
events per 100 patient years. Reported 
serious infections, some with fatal 
outcome, included active tuberculosis, 
which may present with intrapulmonary or 
extrapulmonary disease, invasive 
pulmonary infections, including 
candidiasis, aspergillosis, 
coccidioidomycosis and pneumocystis 
jirovecii, pneumonia, cellulitis, herpes 
zoster, gastroenteritis, diverticulitis, 
sepsis and bacterial arthritis. Cases of 
opportunistic infections have been 
reported. 
Interstitial Lung Disease  
Impaired lung function may increase the 
risk for developing infections. There have 
been post-marketing reports of interstitial 
lung disease (including pneumonitis and 
pulmonary fibrosis), some of which had 
fatal outcomes.

The incidence of infections leading to dose 
interruptions was also numerically higher 
in patients weighing <30 kg treated with 
10 mg/kg tocilizumab (21.4%) compared 
to patients weighing ≥30 kg, treated with 
8 mg/kg tocilizumab (7.6%).

unwell. RoActemra can reduce your body’s 
ability to respond to infections and may 
make an existing infection worse or 
increase the chance of getting a new 
infection. 
If you have had tuberculosis, tell your 
doctor. Your doctor will check for signs 
and symptoms of tuberculosis before 
starting RoActemra. If symptoms of 
tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight 
loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other 
infection appear during or after therapy 
tell your doctor immediately.

Complications of diverticulitis 
Events of diverticular perforations as 
complications of diverticulitis have been 
reported uncommonly with RoActemra in 
RA patients (see section 4.8). RoActemra 
should be used with caution in patients 
with previous history of intestinal 
ulceration or diverticulitis. Patients 
presenting with symptoms potentially 
indicative of complicated diverticulitis, 
such as abdominal pain, haemorrhage 
and/or unexplained change in bowel 
habits with fever should be evaluated 
promptly for early identification of 
diverticulitis which can be associated with 
gastrointestinal perforation. 
SPC section 4.8 Undesirable effects 
Gastrointestinal Perforation 
During the 6-month controlled clinical 
trials, the overall rate of gastrointestinal 
perforation was 0.26 events per 100 
patient years with tocilizumab therapy. In 
the long-term exposure population the 
overall rate of gastrointestinal perforation 
was 0.28 events per 100 patient years. 
Reports of gastrointestinal perforation on 
tocilizumab were primarily reported as 
complications of diverticulitis including 
generalised purulent peritonitis, lower 
gastrointestinal perforation, fistulae and 
abscess.

reported in a total of 56 out of 4,009 
patients (1.4%) treated with tocilizumab 
during the controlled and open label

and potentially fatal in patients who have 
experienced hypersensitivity reactions 
during previous treatment with 
tocilizumab even if they have received 
premedication with steroids and 
antihistamines. If an anaphylactic reaction 
or other serious hypersensitivity reaction 
occurs, administration of RoActemra 
should be stopped immediately, and 
appropriate therapy initiated and 
tocilizumab should be permanently 
discontinued.

patients (5.9%) experienced infusion 
reactions during the infusion and 38 
patients (20.2%) experienced an event 
within 24 hours of an infusion. The most 
common events occuring during infusion 
were headache, nausea and hypotension 
and within 24 hours of infusion were 
dizziness and hypotension. In general, the 
adverse drug reactions observed during or 
within 24 hours of an infusion were similar

Hepatotoxicity 
SPC 
SPC section 4.4 Special warnings and 
precautions for use 
Active hepatic disease and hepatic 
impairment  
Treatment with RoActemra, particularly 
when administered concomitantly with 
MTX, may be associated with elevations in 
hepatic transaminases, therefore, caution 
should be exercised when considering 
treatment of patients with active hepatic 
disease or hepatic impairment (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Hepatic transaminase elevations  
In clinical trials, transient or intermittent 
mild and moderate elevations of hepatic 
transaminases have been reported 
commonly with RoActemra treatment, 
without progression to hepatic injury (see 
section 4.8). An increased frequency of 
these elevations was observed when 
potentially hepatotoxic drugs (e.g. MTX) 
were used in combination with RoActemra. 
When clinically indicated, other liver 
function tests including bilirubin should be

Caution should be exercised when 
considering initiation of RoActemra 
treatment in patients with elevated ALT or 
AST > 1.5 x ULN. In patients with baseline 
ALT or AST > 5 x ULN, treatment is not 
recommended. 
In RA patients, ALT and AST levels should 
be monitored every 4 to 8 weeks for the 
first 6 months of treatment followed by 
every 12 weeks thereafter. For 
recommended modifications based on 
transaminases see section 4.2. For ALT or 
AST elevations > 3–5 x ULN, confirmed by 
repeat testing, RoActemra treatment 
should be interrupted.  
SPC section 4.8 Undesirable effects 
Hepatic transaminase elevations  
During the 6-month controlled trials 
transient elevations in ALT/AST > 3 x ULN 
were observed in 2.1% of patients on 
tocilizumab 8 mg/kg compared to 4.9% of 
patients on MTX and in 6.5% of patients 
who received 8 mg/kg tocilizumab plus 
DMARDs compared to 1.5% of patients on 
placebo plus DMARDs. 
The addition of potentially hepatotoxic 
drugs (e.g. MTX) to tocilizumab 
monotherapy resulted in increased 
frequency of these elevations. Elevations 
of ALT/AST > 5 x ULN were observed in 
0.7% of tocilizumab monotherapy patients 
and 1.4% of tocilizumab plus DMARD 
patients, the majority of whom were 
discontinued permanently from 
tocilizumab treatment. These elevations 
were not associated with clinically relevant 
increase in direct bilirubin, nor were they 
associated with clinical evidence of 
hepatitis or hepatic impairment. During 
the double-blind controlled period, the 
incidence of indirect bilirubin greater than 
the upper limit of normal, collected as a 
routine laboratory parameter, is 6.2% in 
patients treated with 8 mg/kg tocilizumab 
+ DMARD. A total of 5.8% of patients 
experienced an elevation of indirect 
bilirubin of > 1 to 2 x ULN and 0.4% had

Concomitant administration of a single 
dose of 10 mg/kg tocilizumab with 10-
25 mg MTX once weekly had no clinically

Population pharmacokinetic analyses did 
not detect any effect of MTX, non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) or corticosteroids on tocilizumab

The expression of hepatic CYP450 
enzymes is suppressed by the cytokines, 
such as IL-6, that stimulate chronic 
inflammation. Thus, CYP450 expression 
may be reversed when potent cytokine 
inhibitory therapy, such as tocilizumab, is 
introduced. 
In vitro studies with cultured human 
hepatocytes demonstrated that IL-6 
caused a reduction in CYP1A2, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 enzyme 
expression. Tocilizumab normalises 
expression of these enzymes. 
In a study in RA patients, levels of 
simvastatin (CYP3A4) were decreased by 
57% one week following a single dose of 
tocilizumab, to the level similar to, or 
slightly higher than, those observed in

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
In the pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy the primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with 
DAS28 remission (DAS28 < 2.6) with the primary treatment comparison being the TCZ 8 mg/kg + 
MTX treatment group versus the placebo + MTX treatment group. The study met its target: the 
proportion of patients in DAS28 remission at Week 24 was significantly higher in the TCZ 8 mg/kg + 
MTX group than in the placebo + MTX group (44.8% versus 15.0%; OR = 4.77, 95%-CI: 3.19 – 7.14; 
p < 0.0001). Also in other groups the DAS28 results were higher than in the Placebo + MTX group 
(38.7% in TCZ 8mg/kg + placebo group and 31.9% in TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX group). Positive effect was 
observed also on other endpoints, including ACR20, ACR50, ACR70, mTSS. 
Exploratory analysis revealed that TCZ treatment results in reduction of joint damage both in 
combination (8 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg) with MTX and as monotherapy, and this reduction was greater 
than achieved with MTX alone. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
An analysis of long-term efficacy of TCZ in early RA patients was conducted on the all-exposure LTE 
data set. These data showed that early RA patients as well as patients treated with TCZ monotherapy, 
who continued to receive TCZ 8 mg/kg up to 6 years, could maintain clinical benefit for a prolonged 
period of time. 
The study was not designed to formally demonstrate the efficacy of the TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX treatment 
due to the hierarchical testing of the endpoints. Week 52 and preliminary week 104 data already 
showed that clinical benefit was also observed with the TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX dose, although at lower 
rate than for the TCZ 8 mg +MTX group. However there is some evidence that the lower dose has a 
less substantial effect of the inhibition of joint damage.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The unfavourable effects of TCZ are established and include infection, allergic reactions including 
anaphylaxis, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, AST/ALT/bilirubin elevation and 
hypercholesterolaemia. 
The proportions of patients in Study WA19926 who experienced at least one SAE was similar between 
the study groups. The rate of SAEs (per 100-PY) was slightly higher for the TCZ + MTX combination 
groups than for the placebo group. The majority of SAEs were judged by the investigator as being 
unrelated to study treatment. Infections and infestations were the most frequently reported SAEs 
RoActemra 
EMA/431298/2014 
Page 113/115 
  
 
 
followed by neoplasms, benign, malignant, and unspecified (including cysts and polyps), and 
respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. The incidence of the AEs of special interest remained 
stable over time. 
The observed SAE rates in Study WA19926 were consistent with data reported in the DMARD-IR 
population in previous studies as well as with LTE data form IV TCZ studies. Consistent with data from 
these studies, the most frequent SOC affected by SAEs in the WA19926 was “Infections and 
Infestations”. The other SOCs frequently affected with SAEs in study WA19926 also showed a similar 
pattern of distribution as was observed in other TCZ-treated populations. 
Further events defined as events of special interest such as gastrointestinal perforation, demyelination 
disorders, hepatic events, myocardial infarction, stroke and bleeding events either did not occur or 
occurred at a low frequency in ALL-TCZ in Study WA19926.  
The types of AESIs reported in Study WA19926 are consistent with the known safety profile of TCZ. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There was no clear trend for an increase in the incidence of total AEs or infections when Cmin increased 
across quartiles, with the exception of a higher incidence rate for total AEs and infections in the fourth 
quartile of the TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX group compared to the other quartiles in this group. However, the 
population size and the study duration were limited. Especially rare potential or identified risks such as 
infections including tuberculosis, complication of diverticulitis, immunological reactions, malignancies, 
and haematological abnormalities were not found. 
In general, the preliminary Week 104 safety data for study WA19926 are consistent with the 
established safety profile of TCZ in adult RA. The rate of MIs in the WA19926 study is higher than that 
reported for the controlled DMARD-IR population and the LTE All-exposure population. The MI rate in 
study WA19926 has to be interpreted with caution, since it is based on a small number of events (6 
events up to Week 104) study and the 95% CIs are overlapping between the populations. Moreover 
the data and are confounded by individual underlying risk factors at baseline. Furthermore, there is no 
biological plausibility that “first line RA patient” would experience more often MI than second line RA 
patients.  
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory and potentially disabling chronic systemic inflammatory 
disease, characterised by inflammation of the synovium leading to irreversible destruction of the joints 
and disability. Treatment goal is early remission, leading to sustained remission rates, improved 
physical function and health related quality of life, and limited radiographic damage. 
TCZ is an established treatment option for patients with RA who have had an inadequate response to 
anti-TNFs or to non-biologic DMARDS. Study WA19926 demonstrated in treatment naïve RA patients, 
that TCZ in combination with MTX or alone resulted in higher percentages of patients achieving 
remission as measured by the DAS28 remission, ACR/EULAR Boolean and Index remission, and CDAI 
remission. A clinically relevant reduction of structural joint damage at Week 52 compared to MTX alone 
after treatment with TCZ 8 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg in combination with MTX and TCZ 8 mg/kg as a 
monotherapy. 
The unfavourable effects of TCZ are established and include infection, gastro-intestinal disorders, 
infusion reactions, skin disorders, neutropenia, elevation in hepatic enzymes and lipid parameters.

Benefit-risk balance 
The overall benefit-risk balance for RoActemra in treatment of severe, active and progressive RA in 
adults not previously treated with MTX is positive. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
TCZ is an established treatment option for patients with RA who have had an inadequate response to 
anti-TNFs or to non-biologic DMARDS. Treatment naïve RA patients i.e. patients with early arthritis 
showed remission of symptoms and reduction of structural joint damage. The proportion of patients 
who responded to treatment was significant higher in the TCZ group than in the placebo group. The 
risks are well addressed in the SmPC and RMP.

Acute pain occurs as a result of tissue damage and postoperative pain is a manifestation of inflammation 
due to tissue injury or nerve injury, or both. The management of postoperative pain and inflammation 
is a critical component of adult and paediatric patient care (Derry 2013), and if treated inadequately can 
significantly affect recovery (Apfelbaum 2003). Inadequate pain relief in children may lead to short and 
long-term physiological and psychological consequences such as hyperalgesia and anxiety (Berde et al, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/794139/2022  
Page 5/107 
 
 
 
 
 
2012;  Gerik,  2005,  Taddio,  2009)  and  may  diminish  the  effect  of  adequate  analgesia  in  subsequent 
procedures (Weisman et al, 1998). 
Epidemiology  
It has been estimated that 5.4 million patients under the age of 18 undergo inpatient surgical procedures 
every year in the EU (Jonker, 2014). Moderate-to-severe pain is experienced by approximately 60% of 
children following surgery in the hospital setting (Kozlowski et al, 2014). 
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The aetiology and underlying physiology of postsurgical pain is similar in paediatric and adult patients. 
Peripheral, spinal, and supraspinal afferent pain transmission is mature already in neonates (Berde et 
al,  2002).  Relative  to  adults,  children  younger  than  12  years  of  age  have  minor  differences  in  nerve 
myelination (i.e., incomplete myelination in children and shorter distances between nodes of Ranvier) 
that may lead to slower transmission of pain signals (Brislin et al, 2005; Mazoit, 2006; Rose et al, 2004). 
However, these differences are not considered clinically relevant because the major neurons involved in 
nociception, C fibers and A-δ fibers, are unmyelinated or thinly myelinated in adults, respectively (Rose 
et al, 2004). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
During the postoperative period, pain manifests itself with maximum intensity during the first 24 hours, 
reducing progressively (Nava-Obregón, 2016). Most intense pain is experienced on postoperative day 1, 
which decreases slightly by postoperative day 3 (Apfelbaum, 2003). 
Management 
In both paediatric and adult patients, multimodal analgesia is the standard of care for postoperative pain 
management (Chou et al, 2016; American Academy of Pediatrics, 2001). 
Multimodal regimens incorporate two or more agents with different mechanisms of action to maximise 
pain control at lower analgesic doses while minimising drug-induced side effects. The current treatment 
options  for  postsurgical  analgesia  include  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs),  local 
anaesthetics, acetaminophen, opioids, N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists, and α2-adrenergic agonists; 
the specific components of effective multimodal care vary depending on the patient, setting, and surgical 
procedure (Chou et al, 2016). 
Local anaesthetics are particularly useful for management of moderate-to-severe acute pain and have 
been shown to improve postsurgical analgesia and reduce opioid utilization (Berde 2002; Brislin et al, 
2005; Mazoit 2006; Suresh et al, 2014), however, their duration of analgesic effect is typically shorter 
than  the  duration  of  moderate-to-severe  postsurgical  pain,  which  can  often  extend  for  several  days. 
Bupivacaine is one of the longer-acting local anaesthetics but it has a duration of action of approximately 
4-8 hours (Whiteman et al, 2011).

2.1.1.  About the product 
Exparel liposomal is a prolonged-release liposomal dispersion of bupivacaine. It is indicated as a brachial 
plexus block or femoral nerve block for treatment of post-operative pain in adults, and as a field block 
for treatment of somatic post-operative pain from small- to medium-sized surgical wounds in adults. 
Bupivacaine hydrochloride has been used in Europe and worldwide for more than 50 years. It is approved 
for use in paediatric patients aged 1 year and older in the EU (Marcain SmPC) and the UK. 
Exparel was approved by CHMP in 2020 and by the US FDA in October 2011 for the use in adults. FDA 
also  granted  indication  for  children  6  years  of  age  and  older  for  single-dose  infiltration  to  produce 
postsurgical local analgesia. 
Since moderate-to-severe acute pain following surgery or injury from trauma often lasts longer than the 
duration  of  action  offered  by  current  formulations  of  local  anaesthetics,  the  rationale  for  developing 
Exparel has been to provide prolonged acute pain management via a single administration. 
This Type II variation concerns the use of Exparel liposomal as a field block for the treatment of somatic 
post-operative pain from small- to medium-sized surgical wounds in paediatric patients aged 6 and older.  
2.1.2.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Scientific Advice 
The MAH received written scientific advice from HALMED in Croatia on 30 April 2021 and from MHRA in 
the UK on 07 June 2021. Both scientific advices addressed questions on pharmacokinetics, extrapolation 
of study results, safety and SmPC. 
In summary, the approach proposed by the MAH comparing the pharmacokinetics of Exparel in children 
to that in matching surgeries in adults was supported. It was agreed that similar PK profile in adults and 
children  would  allow  to  conclude  on  safety,  however  a  discussion  would  be  required  to  justify  similar 
efficacy. It was also agreed that results from studies of cardiothoracic and spine surgeries would allow 
extrapolation to similar surgeries as these have a long wound size and represent extremes in PK.  
PIP 
The  PIP  Decision  for  EXPAREL  (P/402/2018)  was  issued  on  7th  December  2018  and  was  modified  by 
subsequent PIP Decisions on 29th January 2020 (P/0036/2020), 17th March 2021 (P/0113/2021) and 
9th August 2021 (P/0342/2021). The current clinical measures agreed for the PIP consist of 4 clinical 
studies, two in wound infiltration and two in nerve block. The Final Report submission for Study 402-C-
319,  A  Multicenter  Study  to  Evaluate  the  Pharmacokinetics  and  Safety  of  EXPAREL  for  Postsurgical 
Analgesia in Pediatric Subjects Aged 6 to Less Than 17 years (PLAY), is provided in this type II variation. 
The Compliance Report on the agreed PIP, dated 31 August 2021, confirms that study 402-C-319 was 
compliant with the EMA’s Decision (P/0342/2021) of 9 August 2021. 
At the time of submission of the type II application, the PIP was not yet completed as some measures 
were deferred 
2.1.3.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The MAH provided the statement that all studies were conducted with respect for the individual 
participants according to the respective protocol, the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/794139/2022  
Page 7/107 
 
 
 
and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) as per the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) 
Harmonised Tripartite Guideline. 
FDA inspected one Study 319 US site (No 116), from 12 Feb - 1 Mar 2021 (Voluntary Remote Record 
Review).    Due  to  coronavirus  pandemic,  there  was  no  formal  GCP  inspection,  the  site  was  inspected 
remotely. The site successfully passed its remote record review without major findings. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this variation application, except an assessment of 
environmental risk which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
PHASE I: ESTIMATION OF EXPOSURE 
Assessment for Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity 
According  to  the  guideline,  drug  substances  with  a  logKow  >4.5  should  be  screened  for  persistence, 
bioaccumulation and toxicity (PBT) according to the guidance provided for REACH. 
As the measured partition coefficient values for bupivacaine were below the trigger of 4.5 (0.5 at pH 5, 
2.2 at pH 7 and 3.1 at pH 9), a PBT assessment was not required. The value for the dissociated molecule 
determined around a pH of 7 is considered most realistic for PBT and chemical safety assessment. 
As bupivacaine metabolites are expected to be more soluble in water than the parent drug substance, 
the risk for bioaccumulation of metabolites is also considered to be acceptable. 
Calculation of the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) 
In Phase I, the PEC calculation is restricted to the aquatic compartment. The calculation of the PEC in 
surface water further assumes that the predicted amount used per year is evenly distributed over the 
year  and  throughout  the geographic  area,  the  sewage  system  is the  main  route  of  entry,  there is  no 
biodegradation or retention of the drug substance in the sewage treatment plant (STP) and metabolism 
in the patient is not taken into account. Thus, a PEC is only calculated for the active entity (the parent 
compound or the active metabolite for prodrugs). 
PECSURFACEWATER (expressed in mg/L) is calculated as: 
Figure 1 
(for explanation of abbreviations and values, see Table 1 below). 
An  Fpen  default  value  of  0.01  (1%)  is  proposed  in  the  guideline  assuming  that  100%  of  the  patient 
population is daily taking the medicinal product. Refinement of the Fpen is possible based on a refined 
Pregion and the treatment regimen following: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/794139/2022  
Page 8/107 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2 
If  reasonably  justified  market  penetration  data,  e.g.,  based  on  published  epidemiological  data,  are 
available  to  estimate  a  more  accurate  Pregion,  this  may  be  used.  The  refined  Pregion  represents  the 
prevalence of the medical indication, where possible refined for a subpopulation of patients eligible for 
treatment with the drug substance under consideration. Further refinement based on posology is possible 
for drug products with a well-defined treatment regime. 
The proposed variation is to expand the indication for use as a field block for the treatment of somatic 
postoperative pain from small- to medium-sized surgical wounds in children aged 6 years or older. The 
dose is dependent on the size of the surgical site, the volume required to cover the area and individual 
patient factors that may impact the safety of an amide local anesthetic. 
Exparel is intended for single-dose administration only and is expected to be used once a year (i.e., one 
vial/patient/year). 
There are no data to refine the Fpen based on prevalence for the indications. Therefore, the default of 
0.01  is  used  and  considered  to  cover  all  indications.  As  Fpen  represents  the  fraction  of  a  population 
receiving the active substance, adults and children are covered by definition. 
The default factor of 0.01 as suggested by the guideline is used as Pregion. As EXPAREL is intended to be 
used only once a year as a single dose, Fpen can be refined for posology using 
Equation 2 with ttreatment = 1 and ntreatment,p = 1: 
Fpen = 0.01 * (1 * 1)/365 = 0.0000274 
The calculation of the related PECSURFACEWATER is shown in Table 1 below: 
Table 1:
The PECSURFACEWATER is below the action limit.

In the first version of the ERA report, an additional calculation was included to validate the PEC calculation 
based on default Fpen, using actual consumption data of bupivacaine (not restricted to EXPAREL). The 
additional  calculation  showed  that  the  environmental  exposure  based  on  actual  consumption  of 
bupivacaine was lower than that estimated using the default Fpen. As the default Fpen in the current 
version of the ERA still applies, the exercise of conducting an additional calculation based on consumption 
data is not repeated. 
Applicability of action limit 
As the CHMP guideline indicates that the action limit of 0.01 μg/L is not applicable to all substances, i.e. 
more  specifically,  not  for  substances  that  may  affect  reproduction  of  vertebrate  or  lower  animals  at 
concentrations  lower  than  0.01  μg/L,  the  toxicological  data  related  to  reproduction  in  mammals  are 
considered.  
Bupivacaine  solutions  have  been  marketed  in  Europe  and  the  US  for  many  years  as  a  local 
anaesthetic/analgesic  administered  by  field  block,  peripheral  nerve  block,  and  central  neural  block 
(caudal and epidural). The pharmacology, PK, and toxicology of bupivacaine and its structural analogues 
in laboratory animals and humans are thus well understood. 
Reproduction and developmental toxicology 
Bupivacaine HCl was administered subcutaneously to rats at doses of 4.4, 13.3, and 40 mg/kg and to 
rabbits at doses of 1.3, 5.8, and 22.2 mg/kg during the period of organogenesis (implantation to closure 
of  the  hard  palate).  No  embryo-fetal  effects  were  observed  in  rats  at  the  high  dose  which  caused 
increased  maternal  lethality.  An  increase  in  embryo-fetal  deaths  was  observed  in  rabbits  at  the  high 
dose  in  the  absence  of  maternal  toxicity  with  the  fetal  NOAEL.  The  NOAEL  is  thus  considered  to  be 
5.8 mg/kg/d. 
In a rat pre- and post-natal development study (dosing from implantation through weaning) conducted 
at  subcutaneous  doses  of  4.4,  13.3,  and  40  mg/kg/day,  decreased  pup  survival  was  observed  at  the 
highest dose. The NOAEL is thus considered to be 13.3 mg/kg/day. 
The overall lowest ecologically relevant NOAEL was 5.8 mg/kg. In order to reach this concentration in 
fish,  the  bioconcentration  factor  (BCF)  in  fish  should  be  very  high  (i.e.  concentration  in  fish  / 
PECSURFACEWATER  =  5800  [μg/kg]  /  0.0036  [μg/L]  =1.6E+06  L/kg,  calculated  from  the  worst-case 
PECSURFACEWATER). This is very unlikely, considering the low measured partition coefficient values of 0.5 at 
pH 5, 2.2 at pH 7 and 3.1 at pH 9. 
Therefore, based on available data, bupivacaine is not expected to affect the reproduction of vertebrate 
or lower animals at concentrations lower than the action limit of 0.01 μg/L. 
CONCLUSION 
The measured partition coefficient values of bupivacaine are below 4.5 (i.e., 0.5 at pH 5, 2.2 at pH 7 
and 3.1 at pH 9). Therefore, bupivacaine cannot be identified as a persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic 
(PBT) or a very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB) substance. 
The Phase I PECSURFACEWATER of bupivacaine was 0.0036 μg/L and does not exceed the action limit of 0.01 
μg/L.  Bupivacaine  is  also  not  expected  to  affect  the  reproduction  of  vertebrate  or  lower  animals  at 
concentrations lower than the action limit of 0.01 μg/L. 
Therefore,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  medicinal  product  is  unlikely  to  represent  a  risk  for  the 
Assessment report

environment following its prescribed usage in patients. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No  new  non-clinical  data  have  been  submitted  in  this  variation  application,  except  an  assessment  of 
environmental  risk,  which  is  considered  acceptable.  As  bupivacaine  is  a  well-known  active  substance 
widely used in paediatric patients, additional non-clinical studies, including juvenile toxicity studies, are 
not expected to provide new data and are not thus required.  
However, concerns regarding the suitability of the excipients for the paediatric population and safety of 
the  formulation  in  the  new  proposed  age  category  were  raised  by  the  CHMP.Within  the  response 
documentation,  the  MAH  provided  a  comprehensive  justification  for  safety  and  suitability  of  the 
excipients used in the EXPAREL for the proposed paediatric population. A non-clinical package included 
in  the  original  MAA  application  assessed  the  local  tolerability  of  the  DepoFoam  particle  components, 
specifically  DEPC  as  a  novel  excipient 
in 
the  EU.  DEPC 
is  a  synthetic  homolog  of 
dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) which is a natural lipid. Once the DepoFoam vesicle is broken down 
into individual components DEPC is expected to follow the lipid catabolism pathways similar to a natural 
fatty acid. Furthermore, toxicity studies on the excipient DEPC indicated that it is without significant local 
or  systemic  toxicity  at  single  or  repeated  doses,  and  that  it  has  no  genotoxic,  teratogenic,  or 
developmental effects. In additional, a pilot juvenile rat study submitted as part of the initial MAA did 
not reveal effects of treatment on mortality, clinical findings, body weights or body weight gain, post-
weaning food consumption, macroscopic examinations, or organ weight data.Regarding an assessment 
of  environmental  risk,  the  MAH  has  recalculated  the  PECSURFACEWATER,  using  a  Fpen  for  the  extended 
indication, which is refined based on treatment regime.  
The recalculated PECSURFACEWATER is 0.0036 μg/L. Since PECSURFACEWATER of bupivacaine remains below the 
action limit of 0.01 μg/L, it is still believed that Exparel is unlikely to represent a risk for the environment 
following its prescribed usage in patients. 
In  addition,  the  measured  partition  coefficient  values  of  bupivacaine  are  below  4.5.    Therefore, 
bupivacaine cannot be identified as a persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) or a very persistent 
and very bioaccumulative (vPvB) substance.  
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical studies are required in support of this variation application. The CHMP agreed that 
the excipients used in the EXPAREL are suitable for the paediatric population without safety concerns. 
Based on the updated ERA data submitted in this application, the extended indication does not lead to a 
significant increase in environmental exposure.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
To  support  this  Type  II  variation  and  extension  of  field  block  indication  to  paediatric  patients  aged  6 
years and older, the MAH completed two studies in spine and cardiac procedures (Study 120 and Study 
319). These two highly vascular procedures were selected in order to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and 
safety of EXAPREL under conditions where the highest systemic levels of bupivacaine and corresponding 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/794139/2022  
Page 11/107 
 
 
 
risk  for  toxicity  would  be expected,  thereby  allowing  for  the  data  obtained  to  be  extrapolated  to  less 
invasive procedures.  
Two additional supportive studies in matching surgical procedures (one in spine procedures and one in 
thoracic procedures) in adult subjects who received EXPAREL 266 mg via local infiltration were performed 
to provide a scientific bridge between the paediatric and adult age groups (Study 117 and Study 118). 
Both studies were assessed in the initial MAA. All studies in the program were designed to characterize 
the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of EXPAREL by assessing systemic levels of bupivacaine. Efficacy 
assessments  were  included  in  the  paediatric  studies  as  exploratory  endpoints,  and  these  were  not 
powered to make efficacy claims. 
The basis for the extrapolation of efficacy of EXPAREL from adult to paediatric patients consists of the 
following factors: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
a similar pathophysiology of postsurgical pain in paediatric and adult patients 
a  similar  mechanism  of  action,  metabolic  pathway,  and  response  to  intervention  with 
conventional bupivacaine in paediatric and adult patients  
demonstration  of  efficacy  in  two  Phase  3  randomized,  controlled  studies  (bunionectomy, 
haemorrhoidectomy)  of  EXPAREL  in  adults  that  supported  its  approval  as  a  field  block  for 
treatment of somatic post-operative pain from small- to medium-sized surgical wounds 
4. 
confirmation  of  similar  bupivacaine  exposures  from  single-dose  infiltration  of  EXPAREL  in 
paediatric and adult subjects in matched surgical models and anticipated similar effect site 
exposure  
5. 
the  systemic  absorption  of  bupivacaine  from  EXPAREL  was  similar  among  paediatric  and 
adult  subjects  in  matched  surgical  procedures.  This  observation  in  light  of  the  similar 
metabolism  of  bupivacaine  in  paediatric  and  adult patients  supports  that  the  rate  of  local 
release of bupivacaine from EXPAREL is similar across age groups.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
PK methods 
For Studies 117, 118, and 319, the bupivacaine pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by non-
compartmental analysis of subject data for plasma bupivacaine concentration over time. Actual sampling 
times relative to study drug administration were used to estimate all pharmacokinetic parameters. Cmax 
and Tmax values are described in three ways:  
• Early Cmax / Tmax: values occurring within 0-4 hours after administration of dose 
• Late Cmax / Tmax: values occurring after 4 hours after administration of dose 
•  Global  Cmax  /  Tmax:  the  maximum  values  occurring  during  the  entire  observation  period  after 
administration of dose. 
All mean Cmax and Tmax values were calculated by averaging Cmax and Tmax values for all subjects.  
In Study 120, pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed using a population PK approach. 
Population PK model 
The population PK model of EXPAREL was originally developed using adult PK data from wound infiltration 
studies (201, 208, 316, 317, and 401). This model was updated based on the results of Studies 117, 
120 and 319. 
Both non-compartmental analysis and population PK model were used to analyse PK data in paediatric 
subjects. The methods are considered appropriate. 
No statistical analysis was performed to evaluate similarity of the exposure between paediatric and adult 
population in matching surgical procedures. The comparison is rather of descriptive manner and there 
were no pre-defined criteria to establish similarity in exposures. It is acknowledged that no therapeutic 
range exists for systemic bupivacaine and therefore formal demonstration of statistical similarity in PK 
parameters would not be feasible. Instead, the MAH focuses on showing similar PK profile suggesting 
prolonged release of bupivacaine in paediatric subjects. 
The current variation of EXPAREL at a dose of 4 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 266 mg) is for the treatment 
of paediatric patients aged 6 years and older undergoing spinal or cardiac procedures. To support clinical 
pharmacology in paediatric subjects, two studies were conducted in paediatric subjects undergoing spine

or cardiac surgery (i.e., studies 120 and 319), and two studies were conducted in matching surgeries in 
adults (i.e., studies 117 and 118) to provide a basis for comparison of the pharmacokinetic profiles (see 
Table 2 above).  Of note, Study 120 was utilized to inform the appropriate sampling windows and to 
provide supportive pharmacokinetics and safety data to support the selection of the EXPAREL 4 mg/kg 
dose in Study 319.  
Study  120  was  a  Phase  1,  open-label,  single  arm  study  designed  to  evaluate  the  safety  and 
pharmacokinetics  of  EXPAREL  when  administered  via  local  infiltration  for  postsurgical  analgesia  in 
subjects aged 12 to less than 17 years old undergoing spinal surgery. Eligible subjects received a single 
dose of EXPAREL 4 mg/kg (not to exceed a maximum dose of 266 mg) based on the body weight of the 
subject. Fifteen subjects completed the study for PK and safety assessments. 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the PK of EXPAREL in pediatric subjects 12 to less 
than 17 years of age undergoing spinal surgery.  
The secondary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of EXPAREL in pediatric subjects 12 to 
less than 17 years of age undergoing spinal surgery.  
The pharmacokinetic sampling scheme is presented in Table 3 . Each subject provided either five (Groups 
1 - 3) or eight (Group 4) blood samples for the determination of bupivacaine plasma concentrations. 
Table 3: Pharmacokinetic Blood Sample Collection Timing Schedule 
The amendments in Pharmacokinetic Blood Sample Collection Timing Schedule were introduced before 
inclusion patients in group 4. The characteristic early/late double peak profile, which is often observed 
with EXPAREL administered by infiltration, was either not present or could not be observed due to the 
limited number of samples collected at early time points post-administration. In addition, in all subjects, 
systemic bupivacaine had already fallen to clinically insignificant levels by the fourth sampling time point. 
Thus,  following  the  PK  interim  analysis,  it  was  decided  to  update  the  PK  sampling  scheme  to  include 
more samples at earlier time points and to limit the last PK collection window to 42 - 60 hours post-
EXPAREL administration. 
Pharmacokinetic Results of Study 120 
Prior to implementation of Amendment 2 of Study 120, which changed the pharmacokinetic sampling 
scheme from 5 samples per subject to 8, a total of seven subjects were randomized to either Group 1 
or Group 2 or Group 3 (Table 3). As the pharmacokinetic sampling scheme had been inadequate to fully

characterize  bupivacaine  concentrations  during  the  earlier  sampling  times  (Figure  3),  no  definitive 
pharmacokinetic conclusions could be drawn from these subjects. 
Figure 3 
A  total  of  eight  subjects  were  randomized  to  Group  4.  In  general  subjects  in  this  group  showed  two 
bupivacaine peaks: the first was observed between 15 to 30 minutes (i.e., first two sampling windows) 
following administration of EXPAREL, and second was between 1-3 hours for five subjects and between 
10 to 18 hours for two subjects, which was followed by a gradual decrease to the lowest concentrations 
by approximately 42 to 60 hours (Figure 4). Observed peak plasma concentrations ranged from 331.0 
to 559.0 ng/mL.

Subjects Aged 12 to Less than 17 Years in Study 120, Group 4 
Instead of non-compartmental analysis, the applicant used a population PK model to assess the PK 
parameters for this study as four different sampling schemes were implemented. 
The observed inter individual variability has been explained with non-compliance with study protocol. 
One subject received a single total dose of 80 mg  EXPAREL and  was underdosed; based on subjects’ 
body weight, a total dose of approximately 248 mg EXPAREL should have been administrated, whereas 
two  other  subjects  received  a  single  total  dose  of  286  mg  and  296  mg,  respectively,  exceeding  the 
maximum dose limit of 266 mg, which is also the approved dose in adults.

Study  120  evaluated  PK  and  safety  of  Exparel  4  mg/kg  dose  (up  to  a  maximum  dose  of  266  mg)  in 
paediatric  subjects  (12  to  <  17  years)  undergoing  spinal  surgery.  When  sufficient  PK  samples  were 
obtained  (Group  4,  8  PK  samples),  a  characteristic  double-peak  Exparel  plasma  profile  could  be 
observed. The highest observed bupivacaine plasma concentration in this study was 559 ng/mL at 0.3 
hours, which is below the levels associated with safety concerns in adult subjects. The lowest bupivacaine 
plasma levels were reached by approximately 48 hours which could have implications on the duration of 
the effect. Please see further considerations below. 
The study included exploratory efficacy assessments which are addressed in the Efficacy part of this AR.  
Study  319  was  a  Phase  3,  open-label,  multi-centre  study  to  evaluate the  PK  and  safety  of  EXPAREL 
when administered via infiltration in paediatric subjects aged 12 to less than 17 years undergoing spine 
surgery (Group 1) and in paediatric subjects aged 6 to less than 12 years undergoing spine surgery or 
cardiac surgery (Group 2).  
In Group 1, subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive a single dose of either EXPAREL 4 mg/kg (maximum 
266  mg) or  bupivacaine  HCl  2  mg/kg  (maximum  175  mg).  In  Group 2,  all  subjects  received  a  single 
dose  of  EXPAREL  4  mg/kg  (maximum  266  mg).  Study  drug  was  administered  via  infiltration  into  the 
surgical site prior to wound closure.

following spine surgery is presented in Figure 5.

Study 319 
EXPAREL-treated subjects showed a prolonged duration of measurable systemic bupivacaine compared 
to bupivacaine HCl-treated subjects in the spine surgery group. The pharmacokinetic profile of subjects 
treated with bupivacaine HCl shows that bupivacaine was more rapidly absorbed systemically compared 
at higher peak concentrations than was the case for EXPAREL. 
In Figure 5, Exparel plasma profile combines PK data from patients undergoing spine surgery from Group 
1 (n=16) and Group 2 (n=2), while bupivacaine HCl plasma profile comes from Group 1 subjects only. 
EXPAREL-treated subjects showed a prolonged duration of measurable systemic bupivacaine compared

Pharmacokinetic parameters of Exparel for subjects undergoing spine surgery in Study 319 are shown 
in Table 6 below:

The higher AUC values in EXPAREL-treated subjects were consistent with the higher doses of bupivacaine 
base given to EXPAREL-treated subjects. The Cmax observed in the bupivacaine HCl treatment arm was 
higher (1.45-fold geometric mean) than in the EXPAREL treatment arm, even though the overall Tmax 
values were very similar (~1 h). Two Tmax values were visually apparent for EXPAREL; an Early Cmax 
occurred during the first 2 hours of Exparel administration, and Late Cmax occurred at approximately 
18 hours after administration. For most subjects, Early Cmax was higher than Late Cmax. The highest 
observed  concentration  for  spinal  surgery  was  595  ng/mL  at  1-1.25  hours.  The  highest  observed 
concentration in the bupivacaine HCl 2 mg/kg group was 1270 ng/mL at 0.25 hours. The bupivacaine 
t½ was considerably higher for EXPAREL than for the bupivacaine HCl treatment arm.

Study 319 
Most subjects receiving EXPAREL exhibited two bupivacaine peaks. Early Cmax generally occurred 
during the first hour after Exparel administration and Late Cmax generally occurred at approximately 
30 hours after administration. Afterwards, there was a gradual decrease to approximately 200 ng/mL 
at 60 hours. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters of Exparel for subjects undergoing cardiac surgery in Study 319 are 
shown in the Table 7 below:

Study 319 was a PK and safety study for the use of EXPAREL as a field block for the treatment of somatic 
post-operative  pain  from small-  to  medium-sized  surgical  wounds  in  paediatric  patients  aged 6  years 
and older.  
PK comparison of Exparel 4 mg/kg vs bupivacaine HCl 2 mg/kg in Group 1 (spine surgery in adolescents 
12-17  years  old)  showed  that  Exparel  exhibits  similar  PK  properties  as  already  observed  in  adult 
subjects; slower absorption and more sustained bupivacaine concentrations, in line with the extended 
release of bupivacaine from the multivesicular liposomes. The observed Cmax was lower and Tmax later 
in the Exparel group, with two maximums present in most subjects. However, since systemic plasma 
concentrations do not correlate with the local effect of Exparel, they are more indicative of safety. 
Group 2 included subjects aged 6 to <12 years, who were given Exparel 4 mg/kg only, and most of them 
(n=21)  underwent  cardiac  surgery.  Group  2  included  only  2  subjects  in  the  age  range  6-12  years 
undergoing  spine  surgery,  whereby  the  applicant  concludes  that  the  exposure  matched  that  of  the 
Exparel subjects (12-17 years) in Group 1. This is considered to be a rather limited sample size to allow 
such  conclusion,  although  it  is  generally  acknowledged  no  physiological  reasons  exist  to  expect  an 
influence of age on bupivacaine absorption at the site of action.  
The highest Cmax was observed in cardiac surgery: 1290 ng/mL at 0.5 hours, which is below the levels 
associated with safety concerns in adult subjects. 
Study 117 (in adults) was a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety 
and PK of EXPAREL when administered as a field block via local wound infiltration to subjects undergoing 
open  posterior  spinal  fusion  or  reconstructive  surgery.  Eligible  subjects,  whose  surgical  incision  was 
between 8 and 30 cm in length, received a single dose of EXPAREL (266 mg/20 mL) expanded in volume 
with  40-280  mL  normal  saline,  depending  on  the  size  of  the  incision.  Twelve  subjects  completed  the 
study for PK and safety assessments. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were obtained pre-
dose (on Day 1 prior to study drug administration); at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 
and 96 hours after study drug administration; and on Day 7. 
Three  subjects  were  excluded  from  the  pharmacokinetic  analysis  set,  because  they  did  not  provide 
sufficient samples to allow for the calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters. The PK parameters are 
presented in Table 6. 
Study  118  (in  adults)  was  a  Phase  1,  open-label  study  designed  to  evaluate  the  safety  and 
pharmacokinetics  of  EXPAREL  when  administered  for  postsurgical  analgesia  in  subjects  undergoing 
posterolateral thoracotomy surgery. Eligible subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either Cohort 1 
or Cohort 2 and received a single 266 mg dose of EXPAREL.  
Cohort  1:  20  mL  EXPAREL  +  20  mL  normal  saline  (0.9%)  for  a  total  volume  of  40  mL.  Twenty  mL 
(containing 133 mg liposomal bupivacaine) were injected intercostally over 5 interspaces; the remaining 
volume  (approximately  20  mL,  containing  133  mg  liposomal  bupivacaine)  was  used  to  infiltrate  the 
wound/port/chest tube sites (further diluted as needed to cover incisions). 
Cohort  2:  20  mL  EXPAREL  +  10  mL  normal  saline  (0.9%)  for  a  total  volume  of  30  mL.  Twenty  mL 
(containing 177 mg liposomal bupivacaine) were injected intercostally over 5 interspaces; the remaining 
volume  (approximately  10  mL,  containing  89  mg  liposomal  bupivacaine)  was  used  to  infiltrate  the 
wound/port/chest tube sites (further diluted as needed to cover incisions). 
Five subjects completed the study for PK and safety assessments. 
Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were obtained pre-dose/baseline (Day 1 prior to study drug 
administration) and at 0.5, 1, 4, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hours after study drug administration. The 
PK parameters are presented in Table 6.

For comparison of paediatric PK profiles from Study 319 to adult PK profiles from Study 118 (assessed 
in  the  initial  MAA),  different  routes  of  administration  were  applied.  In  study  118,  Exparel  was 
administered as a posterior intercostal nerve block with wound infiltration of the remaining suspension 
to adult subjects undergoing posterolateral thoracotomy.  
In MAH’s view, since both studies involved cardiothoracic procedures in highly vascular areas and similar 
PK profiles were shown, these studies can be considered comparable. Due to the fact that vascularity is 
one of the key factors affecting systemic absorption and, thus, safety, this approach is acknowledged, 
although this comparison is not considered ideal due to different mode of administration across the two 
studies, as well as the limited sample size in the adult study.  
Comparison  of  Pharmacokinetic  Profile  Between  Paediatric  Subjects  to  Adult  Subjects  in 
Matching Surgical Procedures 
Comparison of Pharmacokinetic Profile Following Spine Surgery 
In the setting of spine surgery, the mean bupivacaine time-concentration curve for paediatric subjects 
who received EXPAREL 4 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 266 mg) in Study 319 was compared to the curve 
for adult subjects who received EXPAREL 266 mg in Study 117 (Figure 7). 
Figure 7: Mean Plasma Bupivacaine Concentrations after Spine Surgery in Adult Subjects 
(Study 117) and in Paediatric Subjects (Study 319) 
The  difference  in  AUC  values  observed  between  age  groups  is  due  to  the  difference  in  absolute  dose 
administered in adults and paediatric subjects. 
The  MAH  has  conducted  additional  population  PK  analyses  which  suggest  that  incision  size  is  not 
significantly  associated  with  greater  exposure.  The  difference  in  AUC  values  observed  between  age 
groups is due to the difference in absolute dose administered in adults and paediatric subjects. 
As already mentioned, no statistical analysis was performed to assess the similarity of the PK profiles 
between  paediatric  and  adult  subjects,  and  there  were  no  pre-defined  criteria  to  evaluate  when  the 
exposures  could  be  considered  similar.  While  it  can  be  concluded  that  PK  profiles  following  Exparel 
administration  in  both  studies  319  and  117  clearly  differ  from  the  PK  profile  of  bupivacaine  HCl 
administered in study 319, it is more difficult to establish the similarity of Exparel PK profiles between 
adult and paediatric patients without adequate statistical comparison.

Due  to  the  sparse  PK  sampling  schemes,  all  PK  comparisons  were  based  on  population  PK  modelling 
rather  than  direct  comparison  of  observed  values  across  groups.  The  characteristic  shape  of  the  PK 
profile between adults and paediatric subjects appears to be reasonably similar, however it is noted that 
while the Early Cmax and Late Cmax are considerably similar between the children and adolescents, the 
pediatric  population  in  whole  has  demonstrated  lower  values  than  adult  population.  Based  on  the 
applicant’s  view,  the  difference  is  observed  due  to  different  absolute  dose  administered  -  in  adult 
population, a 266 mg dose of EXPAREL irrespective of weight was administered, whereas in in paediatric 
subjects 4 mg/kg, up to a maximum of 266 mg, were administered.  
It is important to note that the paediatric exposure remaining below the adult exposure can support the 
safety of the proposed paediatric dose 4 mg/kg.  
Using population PK model for spinal procedures, AUC, early Cmax, and late Cmax for adolescents dosed 
at 4 mg/kg were 37-39% lower, 22-35% lower, 30-36% lower than adults dosed at 266 mg, depending 
on the statistic (Table 8). For children dosed at 4 mg/kg, the AUC, early Cmax, late Cmax values were 
55-58% lower, 31-35% lower, 43-56% lower than adults dosed at 266 mg.

In the setting of cardiac surgery, the mean bupivacaine time-concentration curve for paediatric subjects

for adult subjects who received EXPAREL 266 mg in Study 118 (Figure 8).

Figure 8: Mean Plasma Bupivacaine Concentrations after Cardiothoracic Surgery in Adult 
Subjects (Study 118) and in Paediatric Subjects (Study 319) 
It is noted that comparison of paediatric PK profiles from Study 319 to adult PK profiles from Study 118 
is made using different routes of administration as discussed above. However, since both studies involved 
cardio-thoracic  procedures  with  high  vascularity,  this  approach  could  be  acknowledged.  In  cardiac 
surgery, PK data are available only from subjects of younger age group (6 to < 12 years). During initial 
assessment,  the  applicant  was  asked  to  estimate  the  exposure  for  the  adolescent  group  (12  to  <  17 
years) using the developed Pop PK model and discuss whether exposure could be considered similar. 
With  the  responses,  the  applicant  has  provided  additional  analysis  showing  that  canonical  overall  PK 
profile of Exparel is evident in all age groups, although more variability was observed in the early and 
late Cmax values among adults relative to adolescents and children, whereas early Cmax values were 
similar in all age groups. 
Paediatric subjects undergoing cardiac surgery had higher bupivacaine exposures based on Cmax and 
AUC  compared  to  subjects  undergoing  spine  surgery.  However,  these  exposures  were  below  the 
exposures associated with safety concerns in adult subjects. 
The bupivacaine exposure parameters in adults and paediatric subjects who received EXPAREL into the 
thoracic wall and surrounding subcutaneous tissue following cardiac and thoracic surgery were generally 
similar (Table 10).

Table 9: Bupivacaine PK Parameters with EXPAREL in Paediatric Subjects and Adult Subjects

Using population PK model for cardiac procedures, AUC and late Cmax values for adolescents dosed at 
4 mg/kg were 36-39% lower and 33-40% lower than adults dosed at 266 mg, respectively, depending 
on the statistic (Table 10). For children dosed at 4 mg/kg, AUC and late Cmax values were 55-58% lower 
and 47-53% lower than adults dosed at 266 mg, respectively. Early Cmax values were similar in all age 
groups due to very high absorption rate. 
Table 10: Summary of Predicted Individual Exposures of EXPAREL Following Cardiothoracic 
Procedures by Age Group, Final Model 520 
Pop PK modelling has shown that the differences in observed bupivacaine exposure between adolescents 
and children relative to adults in the clinical studies are consistent with the magnitudes of the differences 
that would occur between adults receiving EXPAREL at corresponding absolute dose levels (266 mg, 194 
mg and 132 mg).

Evaluation and Qualification of Models  
Two pop-PK models estimating the PK parameters in paediatric population have been presented by the 
applicant:

• 
Population PK Analysis of EXPAREL in Studies 402-C-120 and 402-C-117, 
Population PK Analysis of EXPAREL and Bupivacaine HCL in Study 402-C-319. 
Population PK Analysis of EXPAREL in Studies 402-C-120 and 402-C-117 
A  previously  developed  population  PK  model  of  bupivacaine  following  administration  of  EXPAREL  as 
wound  infiltration  to  adult  subjects  in  various  surgical  procedures  was  expanded  to  describe  spinal 
procedures in pediatric (12 - <17 years old) and adult subjects (from study 117). Absorption parameters 
for the spinal procedures were added to the model; differences between absorption parameters of adult 
and pediatric subjects were explored; the influence of body weight and sex on the PK parameters was 
evaluated. 
Objectives of the population PK model were: 
• 
To expand a population PK model of EXPAREL administered as a wound infiltration to describe 
spinal surgical procedures in pediatric (12 - <17 years) and adult subjects.

Model  development  was  data  driven  and  was  based  on  various  goodness-of-fit  indicators,  including 
diagnostic plots, precision of parameter estimates, and the minimum objective function value (a p-value 
of 0.01 was used for model discrimination). The model was evaluated using various diagnostic plots and 
visual predictive check techniques.  
The diagnostic plots of the model did not indicate any model deficiencies. The visual predictive check

percentile of the observed data seems to be over-predicted by the model. This is considered to provide 
an additional safety margin for the simulated data.

concentrations, PK parameters, and exposures (Early and Late Cmax and Tmax and AUC) in pediatric

Source: Population PK AnalysisReport  of EXPAREL inEXPAREL Studies 402-C-120 and 402-C-117 
Based  on  the  model  simulations,  the  MAH  concludes  that  PK  of  bupivacaine  in  adult  and  paediatric 
subjects undergoing spinal procedures was generally similar. While early and late Cmax appear to be 
comparable  between  paediatric  and  adult  subjects,  AUC  and  t1/2  were  quite  lower  in  paediatric 
population.  In  Study  120,  observed  bupivacaine  plasma  concentrations  reached  the  lowest  levels  by 
approximately 42 to 60 hours and it was evident from the simulations that bupivacaine concentrations 
drop  faster  for  adolescents  compared  to  adults.  Therefore,  during  initial  assessment,  a  concern  was 
raised  whether  lower  AUC,  shorter  t1/2  and  reaching  lowest  concentrations  earlier  in  paediatric 
population could affect efficacy and duration of effect in this population. The MAH again emphasized that 
PK of local anaesthetics are more relevant to safety than efficacy. The systemic concentration of a local 
anaesthetic  is  not  directly  correlated  with  pain  relief  because  the  degree  of  analgesia  a  patient 
experiences  at  a  given  time  is  determined  by  the  exposure  of  the  agent  at  the  site  of  action,  which 
cannot be measured in vivo. Bupivacaine PK profile following Exparel administration in paediatric patients 
was showing characteristics of the prolonged bupivacaine release at the site of action, similar as in adult 
patients. 
Population PK Analysis of EXPAREL and Bupivacaine HCL in Study 402-C-319 
The  objective  was  to  expand  an  earlier  developed  population  PK  model  that  described  EXPAREL 
administered as a wound infiltration in adult and adolescent subjects to characterize PK of EXPAREL and 
bupivacaine HCL in pediatric subjects (6 -<17 years) in study 402-C-319.

Additional Population PK Modelling to Evaluate the Similarity of PK in Adults and Paediatric 
Patients 
The key Population PK findings from the final model (Model 520, Population PK Report V3) for adult 
and paediatric patients include: 
• Apparent clearance and inter-compartment clearance does not depend on body weight or age among 
individuals less than 55 years of age. Apparent central and peripheral volumes are proportional to body 
weight in individuals with a weight up to 75 kg, with no further increase at weights exceeding 75 kg, 
with no dependency on age. 
• The AUC of bupivacaine with EXPAREL for a given procedure is equal to dose divided by clearance. 
Since clearance is not dependent on age (<55 years) or weight, the AUC would be proportional to the 
total dose administered. 
• The early Cmax of bupivacaine with EXPAREL is reciprocal to the volume of distribution, which is 
proportional to body weight up to 75 kg and is almost independent of clearance. Thus, regardless of 
age, early Cmax values would be similar for individuals of different weights if they were dosed on a 
mg/kg basis. At a fixed dose, individuals of different body weights would be expected to have early 
Cmax values approximately proportional to their respective difference in weight regardless of age (with 
individuals of lower weight having proportionally higher early Cmax values). 
• The late Cmax of bupivacaine with EXPAREL depends on both clearance (like AUC) and volume (like 
early Cmax). Since both factors play a role, the effect of weight and dose on late Cmax would be 
expected to be of a magnitude between that for AUC and early Cmax. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/794139/2022  
Page 32/107 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Therefore, if the same dose (e.g., 266 mg) was administered to adult and paediatric patients, the AUC 
values would be expected to be equivalent, but the early and late Cmax values would be higher in 
paediatric patients than adults due to their difference in weight. To preserve safety in paediatric 
patients, it is appropriate to dose EXPAREL in a weight-based manner such that the maximum 
bupivacaine concentrations do not exceed those of adults.  
In the clinical studies, while the same prolonged-release profile would be expected in all age groups, 
AUC values would be expected to trend lower with age since paediatric subjects received lower 
absolute doses than adults. Early and late Cmax values for paediatric subjects would also be expected 
to trend lower than adults because of the lower absolute dose administered on the basis of weight (to 
ensure that Cmax values in paediatric subjects did not exceed those of adults). 
To address the differences in dosing paradigms, the final Pop PK model of field block in adults (Model 
132) was utilized to evaluate whether the magnitudes of the observed differences in PK parameters 
between adult and paediatric subjects in the clinical studies were consistent with the differences that 
would be expected among adults of the same age and weight who were administered different 
absolute doses of EXPAREL. The reference adult weight used for the simulations was 75 kg and the 
reference dosing values evaluated in these simulations were: 
• 266 mg 
• 194 mg (corresponding to the median weight of 12-<17-year-olds: 48.5 kg * 4 mg/kg) 
• 132 mg (corresponding to the median weight of 6-<12-year-olds: 33 kg * 4 mg/kg) 
The estimated fraction of EXPAREL dose absorbed through the fast route was 21% for spinal 
procedures and 7.4% for cardiac procedures. Spinal and cardiac procedures were not evaluated in the 
adult studies that were included in the final model for field block in adults. Therefore, the population 
PK model for haemorrhoidectomy derived from the composite population pharmacokinetics data was 
selected to emulate PK in spinal procedures and the population PK model for inguinal hernia repair was 
selected to emulate PK cardiac procedures because of their similar fractions of EXPAREL dose absorbed 
through the fast route (25% and 11%, respectively). 
Pop PK Evaluation Corresponding to Spinal Procedures 
Holding weight (75 kg), sex (male), and age (<55 years) constant, the estimated PK parameters for 
the adult dosing groups undergoing haemorrhoidectomy procedures were proportional to dose (Table 
17 and Figure 11). The AUC, early Cmax, and late Cmax values in adults who received 194 mg and 
132 mg were 27% and 50% lower than adults who received 266 mg, respectively, for all statistics 
(i.e., geometric mean, median, and mean). Thus, if the release of bupivacaine from EXPAREL was 
comparable in paediatric and adult individuals, an adolescent (weighing 48.5 kg) or a child (weighing 
33 kg) who received EXPAREL at 4 mg/kg would be expected to have AUC parameters that were 
approximately 27% or 50% lower than an adult (weighing 75 kg) dosed at 266 mg, respectively. The 
Cmax parameters would also be expected to be lower in children and adolescents, but not to the same 
degree as with AUC for the reasons outlined earlier.

The magnitudes of the differences in PK parameters between adults dosed at 266 mg and paediatric 
subjects dosed at 4 mg/kg in the clinical studies were similar to the predicted differences in adults at 
the corresponding dose levels. In the clinical studies, AUC, early Cmax, and late Cmax for adolescents 
dosed at 4 mg/kg were 37-39% lower, 22-35% lower, 30-36% lower than adults dosed at 266 mg, 
depending on the statistic (Table 18). For children dosed at 4 mg/kg, the AUC, early Cmax, late Cmax

values were 55-58% lower, 31-35% lower, 43-56% lower than adults dosed at 266 mg. (It is 
important to note that the exposure values in paediatric and adult subjects were derived from actual 
data in the clinical trials where age and weight varied across subjects in each group; thus, some 
variability across statistics would be expected unlike the adult simulations described above where age, 
weight, and sex were held constant.)

In addition, the plasma concentration-time curves among adults dosed at 266 mg and paediatric 
subjects dosed at 4 mg/kg undergoing spinal procedures (Figure 12) were consistent with the 
predicted PK for adults undergoing haemorrhoidectomy (i.e., a surgical procedure with a similar 
fraction of bupivacaine absorption from EXPAREL through the fast route) at corresponding dose levels 
(Figure 11).

Holding weight, sex, and age constant, the estimated PK parameters for the adult dosing groups 
undergoing inguinal hernia procedures were proportional to dose (Table 19 and Figure 13). The 
exposure values (AUC, early Cmax, and late Cmax) of the adult dosing groups that were selected to 
represent the dose received by adolescents at the median weight (194 mg) and children at the median 
weight (132 mg) in the clinical studies were 27% and 50% lower than adults dosed at 266 mg, 
respectively. As described earlier, in the clinical studies, AUC values would be expected to be 
approximately 27% and 50% lower in adolescents and children than adults, respectively. Cmax 
parameters would also generally be expected to be lower, but not to the same degree as for AUC.

Apart from early Cmax, the magnitudes of the differences in PK parameters between adults dosed at 
266 mg and paediatric subjects dosed at 4 mg/kg in the clinical studies were similar to the predicted 
differences in adults at the corresponding dose levels. In the clinical studies, the early Cmax values 
were similar in all age groups due to the very high fast absorption rate (ka,fast), however weight-
based dosing preserved the intended goal of Cmax values in paediatric subjects not exceeding those of 
adults. AUC and late Cmax values for adolescents dosed at 4 mg/kg were 36-39% lower and 33-40% 
lower than adults dosed at 266 mg, respectively, depending on the statistic (Table 20). For children 
dosed at 4 mg/kg, AUC and late Cmax values were 55-58% lower and 47-53% lower than adults 
dosed at 266 mg, respectively.

profiles in adults for inguinal hernia repair (i.e., a surgical procedure with a similar fraction of 
bupivacaine absorption from EXPAREL through the fast route) at corresponding dose levels (Figure 13).

Pop PK modelling has shown that the differences in observed bupivacaine exposure between 
adolescents and children relative to adults in the clinical studies are consistent with the magnitudes of 
the differences that would occur between adults receiving EXPAREL at corresponding absolute dose 
levels.  
Absorption, Distribution, Elimination 
No additional absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) studies have been conducted 
for the paediatric local infiltration indication. 
Absorption 
It  is  known  that  the  rate  of  systemic  absorption  of  bupivacaine  is  dependent  upon  the  total  dose  of 
medicine administered, the route of administration, and the vascularity of the administration site. 
Disposition 
The  bupivacaine  metabolic  pathway  is  similar  in  adults  and  children.  The  factors  that  influence  the 
pharmacology of amide-type local anesthetics are substantially mature in paediatric patients by 2 years 
of age (Berde et al, 2002, Brislin et al, 2005): 
Assessment report

• 
Bupivacaine  metabolism  is  similar  in  adults  and  children  because  hepatic  cytochrome  P-450 
levels increase to adult levels in the first few months of life. 
• 
Bupivacaine clearance is similar in adults and children because renal function in infants reaches 
adult levels by 12 months. 
• 
Levels  of  plasma  albumin  and  alpha-1  acid  glycoprotein  increase  during  infancy;  by  early 
childhood, levels of unbound bupivacaine in plasma are similar to those observed in adults. 
No significant differences are expected in bupivacaine disposition between adults and paediatric patients 
(6-17 years) based on the published literature. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacology of bupivacaine has been extensively characterised in the scientific literature and it 
has been an approved local anaesthetic for several decades.  
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
No PK/PD modelling was conducted. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
To  support  this  Type  II  variation,  the  MAH  has  performed  and  submitted  two  studies  in  paediatric 
subjects: Study 120 (to support the chosen paediatric dose) and Study 319 (PK and safety study used 
as the basis for efficacy extrapolation). 
Both  studies  characterized  PK  and  safety  profile  of  Exparel,  while  efficacy  measurements  were  only 
exploratory. 
Efficacy is extrapolated from adults to paediatric patients 6 years and older based on the similarity of 
the exposures achieved in matching surgical procedures. Moreover, pathophysiology of postsurgical pain 
is considered comparable, and mechanism of action, metabolic pathway and response to intervention 
with bupivacaine is considered similar between the paediatric subjects of this age range and adults. 
PK methods 
The  sample  size  of  subjects  for  Study  120  and  319  was  chosen  to  enable  characterization  of  the  PK 
profile in paediatric population.  
Both non-compartmental analysis and population PK model were used to analyse PK data in paediatric 
subjects. The methods are considered appropriate. 
With  regards  to  assessment  of  similarity  of  the  exposure  between  paediatric  and  adult  population  in 
matching surgical procedures, the comparison was descriptive, without pre-defined criteria to establish 
similarity in exposures. This was considered a limitation. The MAH further clarified that no therapeutic 
range exists for systemic bupivacaine and therefore formal demonstration of statistical similarity in PK 
parameters would not be feasible. The MAH therefore focused focuses on demonstrating the similar PK 
profile suggesting prolonged release of bupivacaine in paediatric subjects. 
ADME 
No additional ADME studies have been conducted which is acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/794139/2022

Based  on  the  published  literature,  no  significant  differences  are  expected  in  bupivacaine  disposition 
between adults and paediatric patients (6-17 years) since bupivacaine protein binding, metabolism and 
renal clearance are similar. 
Due to the prolonged release system, the absorption of bupivacaine from Exparel liposomal is expected 
to depend primarily on the release from the liposomes. The slow release of bupivacaine is likely due to 
reorganization of the barrier lipid membranes and subsequent diffusion of the drug over an extended 
period of time. Even though lipid metabolism is not thought to be the primary mechanism of bupivacaine 
prolonged release, based on literature, there are no apparent differences between adult and paediatric 
populations (6 years and older) with respect to the metabolism of lipid components of the multivesicular 
liposomes that could lead to differential absorption. 
Study 120 
Study 120 was a Phase 1, open-label, single arm study that evaluated PK and safety of Exparel 4 mg/kg 
dose (up to a maximum dose of 266 mg) in paediatric subjects (12 to < 17 years) undergoing spinal 
surgery. No formal dose-response study was performed. The 4 mg/kg dose was selected based on an 
earlier experience in paediatric patients and was the only dose evaluated.  
During initial assessment, a major objection was raised to address the issue regarding applicability of 
the same dose to all types of paediatric surgeries under the extrapolation concept. With the responses, 
the MAH clarified that the  dose of 4 mg/kg was the maximum dose studied. The actual administered 
dose in the clinical practice depends on the clinician's judgement of the size of the surgical wound, the 
volume required to cover the area and individual patient factors. This is considered acceptable. 
The objective of Study 120 was to investigate whether the exposures achieved using Exparel 4 mg/kg 
(up to 266 mg) were similar to the exposures achieved in adult patients receiving 266 mg Exparel and 
undergoing spinal surgery. 
Due to sparse sampling in study 120, PK parameters were estimated using a population PK model. The 
previously developed population PK model of bupivacaine following administration of Exparel as wound 
infiltration to adults was updated and refined using the data from spinal surgeries in adolescents (Study 
120) and adult patients (Study 117).  
Groups 1-3 provided only 5 PK samples and could not identify double peaks. When sufficient PK samples 
were obtained (Group 4, 8 PK samples), a characteristic double-peak Exparel plasma profile could be 
observed. The highest observed bupivacaine plasma concentration in this study was 559 ng/mL at 0.3 
hours, which is below the levels associated with safety concerns in adult subjects. The lowest bupivacaine 
plasma levels were reached by approximately 48 hours which could have implications on the duration of 
the effect.  
Based  on  the  Pop  PK  model  predictions,  the  MAH  concludes  that  the  PK  of  bupivacaine  in  adult  and 
paediatric  subjects  undergoing  spinal  procedures  was  generally  similar.  While  early  and  late  Cmax 
appeared to be comparable between paediatric and adult subjects, AUC and t1/2 were considerably lower 
in  paediatric  population.  Observed  bupivacaine  plasma  concentrations  reached  the  lowest  levels  by 
approximately 42 to 60 hours and it was evident from the simulations that bupivacaine concentrations 
dropped faster for adolescents compared to adults. During the initial assessment, a concern was raised 
whether lower AUC, shorter t1/2 and reaching lowest concentrations earlier in paediatric population could 
affect efficacy and duration of effect in this population.  
The MAH has provided additional discussion that systemic concentrations are not directly correlated to 
a  magnitude  of  analgesic  effect.  Bupivacaine  PK  profile  following  Exparel  administration  in  paediatric

patients shows characteristics of the prolonged bupivacaine release at the site of action, similar as in 
adult patients. 
It  was  noted  that  two  paediatric  subjects  in  Study  120  received  a  single  total  dose  that  exceeded 
maximum  recommended  dose  of  266  mg  in  adults.  The  peak  concentrations  for  these  subjects  were 
however comparable to other study subjects. 
Section 4.2 of the SmPC provides dosing guidance that maximum mg/kg dose should not exceed 266 
mg. 
Study 319 
Study 319 was a Phase 3, open-label, multi-center study to evaluate the PK and safety of EXPAREL when 
administered via infiltration in paediatric subjects aged 12 to less than 17 years undergoing spine surgery 
(Group 1) and in paediatric subjects aged 6 to less than 12 years undergoing spine surgery or cardiac 
surgery (Group 2). 
A total of 8  PK samples  was collected per subject and PK parameters were calculated using the non-
compartmental analysis. Additionally, population PK model was further updated and refined using the 
data from Study 319. 
The chosen surgical models (spine and cardiac surgery) do not completely correspond to adult Exparel 
indication for small- to medium-sized surgical wounds. However, both surgical sites are highly vascular 
and  can  be  regarded  as  procedures  of  highest  risk  for  systemic  toxicity.  It  was  therefore  considered 
acceptable to extrapolate safety results to the less invasive procedures included in the indication. 
Spine surgery 
PK comparison of Exparel 4 mg/kg vs bupivacaine HCl 2 mg/kg in Group 1 (spine surgery in adolescents 
12-17  years  old)  showed  that  Exparel  exhibits  similar  PK  properties  as  already  observed  in  adult 
subjects; slower absorption and more sustained bupivacaine concentrations, in line with the extended 
release of bupivacaine from the multivesicular liposomes. The observed Cmax was lower and Tmax later 
in the Exparel group, with two maximums present in most subjects.  
While it can be concluded that PK profiles following Exparel administration in both studies 319 and 117 
clearly  differ  from  the  PK  profile  of  bupivacaine  HCl  administered  in  study  319,  it  is  more  difficult  to 
establish the  similarity  of  Exparel  PK  profiles between  adult  and  paediatric  patients  without  adequate 
statistical comparison. 
Additional population PK analyses suggest that incision size is not significantly associated with higher 
bupivacaine  exposure.  The  difference  in  AUC  values  observed  between  age  groups  is  due  to  the 
difference in absolute dose administered in adults and paediatric subjects. 
To  compare  PK  parameters  between  adults  and  adolescents  (12  to  <17  years)  undergoing  spinal 
procedures, EXPAREL exposures (early Cmax, late Cmax, and AUC from zero to infinity [AUC0-inf]) were 
predicted  using  the  final  population  PK  model  (Model  520)  with  spinal-surgery-specific  parameters 
derived from adult and adolescent data (Population PK Report V5). Exposures were predicted for adults 
from Study 117 (N=13) and for adolescents (12 to < 17 years) from Study 319 (N=16). The expected 
exposures  for  children  (6  to  <  12  years)  following  spinal  procedures  were  estimated  using  individual 
doses, covariates, and random effects of children who received EXPAREL for cardiac procedures in Study 
319 (N=20).

All PK parameters for cardiothoracic surgery were estimated using the population PK model due to the 
sparse  PK  sampling  schemes.  To  compare  PK  parameters  between  adults,  adolescents,  and  children 
undergoing cardiothoracic procedures, EXPAREL exposures (early Cmax, late Cmax, and AUC0-inf) were 
predicted  using  the  final  population  PK  model  (Model  520)  with  cardiothoracic-surgery-specific 
parameters derived from Study 319 data in children (6 to <12 years, N=20). Expected exposures for 
adults  and  adolescents  (12  to  <17  years)  following  cardiothoracic  procedures  were  estimated  using 
individual  doses,  covariates,  and  random  effects  of  the  subjects  that  received  EXPAREL  for  spinal 
procedures  in  Study  117  for  adults  (N=13)  and  in  Study  319  for  adolescents  (N=20).  Exposures  for 
these subjects following cardiothoracic procedures were predicted using the final population PK model 
(Population  PK  Report  V5).  Paediatric  subjects  undergoing  cardiac  surgery  had  higher  bupivacaine 
exposures based on Cmax and AUC compared to subjects undergoing spine surgery. The highest Cmax 
in paediatric subjects was observed in cardiac surgery: 1290 ng/mL at 0.5 hours, which is below the 
levels associated with safety concerns in adult subjects. 
The comparison of paediatric PK profiles from Study 319 to adult PK profiles from Study 118 (assessed 
in the initial MAA) is made, although the route of administration was not uniform across the two studies.  
Extrapolation concept 
Publications  from  Dunne  et  al.  (2011)  and  Berde  et  al.  (2012)  suggest  that  it  would  be  scientifically 
reasonable to extrapolate efficacy from adults to paediatric population for local anesthetics with well-
known mechanism of action, such as bupivacaine. In that case, paediatric studies should focus on PK, 
dose response and safety. In this procedure, PK and safety aspects are addressed, while dose response 
was not formally evaluated. The dose of 4 mg/kg was selected based on prior experience in the real-
world evidence study “Retrospective Analysis of Pediatric Utilization of Liposomal Bupivacaine: Cleveland 
Clinic Experience,” and evaluated in Study 120.  
Extrapolation of efficacy from adults to paediatric patients is based on similar systemic exposure that is 
expected to lead to similar exposures at the site of action and thus similar efficacy.  
The  following  arguments  have  been  put  forward  by  the  MAH  to  justify  the  general  assumption  that 
extrapolation is possible based on comparable exposure levels achieved following the use of Exparel in 
matching surgical procedures: 
- 
Discussion  was  provided  to  confirm  similar  pathophysiology  of  postsurgical  pain  between 
paediatric (6 years and older) and adult patients based on data from literature 
- 
Discussion  was  provided on  similar  mechanism  of  action,  metabolic  pathway  and  response  to 
intervention based on data from literature 
- 
Demonstrated efficacy of Exparel as a field block for the treatment of somatic postoperative pain 
from small-to-medium sized surgical wounds in adults was referenced to 
- 
Discussion on similar PK profiles of bupivacaine following field block with Exparel in paediatric 
and  adult  subjects  in  matched  surgical  models  was  provided  suggesting  similar  local  release  rate  of 
bupivacaine from Exparel 
With regards to the pathophysiology of postsurgical pain, it is agreed that pain transmission is mature 
in paediatric subjects of the proposed age range (6 years and older) and can thus be considered similar 
to that in adults. Moreover, metabolic pathways involved in bupivacaine clearance are also substantially 
mature in paediatric subjects by 2 years of age. There are no apparent differences between adult and 
paediatric  populations  (6  years  and  older)  with  respect  to  the  metabolism  of  lipid  components  of  the 
multivesicular  liposomes,  so  it  is  not  expected  that  there  could  be  clinically  significant  differences 
between adult and paediatric population in respect of absorption. This allows to justify the extrapolation 
Assessment report

Page 44/107 
 
 
 
 
 
concept from studies in adults to children based on a similar systemic exposure, which is in principle 
considered appropriate.  
While it is well-known that systemic bupivacaine concentrations do not correlate with analgesic effect, 
they could be considered indicative of the release profile of the local anaesthetic at the site of action. 
When used as a short-acting agent, bupivacaine is rapidly absorbed, distributed, and cleared from the 
site of action with an expected duration of effect of 3-8 hours as a field block. Exparel, on the contrary, 
provides prolonged effect with its prolonged release from liposomes, and the efficacy has been confirmed 
in  studies  with  adults.  With  the  current  application,  the  applicant  has  provided  PK  data  in  paediatric 
patients which show similar PK prolonged-release pattern.  
Since observed PK data are based on relatively sparse sampling scheme, PK exposure parameters for 
comparison  between  adult  and  paediatric  patients  are  obtained  using  population  PK  modelling.  Using 
population  PK  model  for  spinal  procedures,  comparison  of  Exparel  liposomal  PK  between  adult  and 
paediatric patients shows that adolescent patients (12 to <17 years old) had approximately 30% lower 
early Cmax, late Cmax and AUC, while children (6 to <12 years old) had approximately 50% lower early 
Cmax, late Cmax and AUC compared to adults who underwent matching procedure and received 266 mg 
dose of Exparel liposomal. Similar pattern was observed for cardiac procedures, except for early Cmax 
that  was  similar  in  all  age  groups.  Due  to  lower  systemic  exposures  observed  in  paediatric  patients 
compared to  adults,  overall  similarity  of  systemic  exposures  and the impact on  efficacy  extrapolation 
was questioned. 
As Cmax and AUC are not indicative of therapeutic effect at the site of action, it is generally acknowledged 
that  no  therapeutic  range  exists  for  systemic  bupivacaine  and  therefore  formal  demonstration  of 
statistical similarity in PK parameters would not be relevant. Moreover, when compared to bupivacaine 
HCl  2  mg/kg  dosed  in  adolescents  who  underwent  spine  procedures,  lower  Cmax  and  increased  AUC 
were observed which is in line with the characteristic PK profile of a slow-release bupivacaine.  
Additional  simulations  performed  have  shown  that  the  magnitude  of  differences  in  PK  parameters 
observed between adult and paediatric subjects was comparable to the differences expected in adults 
due  to  different  absolute  dose  administered  given  that  adults  received  a  fixed  dose  of  266  mg  and 
paediatric subjects received 4 mg/kg dose (up to a maximum of 266 mg). Body weight was not found 
to  be  a  significant  covariate  on  clearance.  Therefore,  AUC  values  would  be  expected  to  be  lower  in 
paediatric subjects receiving lower absolute doses than adults. Early and late Cmax values would also 
be expected to trend lower, which is acceptable from the safety perspective. Given that 266 mg is the 
maximum recommended dose in adults, and the actual dose administered to adult patient can be lower, 
the  magnitude  of  decreased  exposures  observed  in  paediatric  subjects  can  be  considered  reasonably 
similar to adult exposure and is not expected to have an impact on efficacy.  
The observed systemic exposure in children 6 years and older with similar PK characteristics as in adult 
population seems to be sufficiently convincing evidence to conclude on the similar pattern of bupivacaine 
release from liposomal particles at the site of action and, thus, local anaesthetic efficacy. 
Based  on  the  data  provided,  the  efficacy  of  Exparel  as  a  field  block  for  treatment  of  somatic  post-
operative pain from small- to medium-sized surgical wounds in adults can be extrapolated to paediatric 
patients 6 years and older. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The application is considered approvable from the clinical pharmacology point of view.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
Clinical efficacy was evaluated in two studies: extrapolated from pharmacokinetics data obtained in two 
studies: 
•  Study 402-C-120 (Study 120): a phase 1, open-label, pharmacokinetic and safety study used to 
support the dosing of 4 mg/kg in Study 402-C-319 and to provide supportive pharmacokinetic 
and safety data on EXPAREL for the proposed indication. All paediatric patients treated in this 
study underwent a spinal surgery.  
•  Study  402-C-319  (Study  319):  a  Phase  3,  open-label,  pharmacokinetic  and  safety  study 
supporting the use of EXPAREL for local infiltration. Paediatric subjects in this study underwent 
either a spinal or cardiac surgery. 
Both  studies  included  exploratory  efficacy  endpoints,  however,  they  were  not  powered  to  evaluate 
efficacy and only descriptive data on efficacy were available. 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No  dose-response  studies were  performed  for  6-17 years  old  paediatric  subjects.  Exparel  dosing  was 
based  on  body  weight,  consistent  with  general  standards  for  dosing  of  local  anesthetics  in  paediatric 
practice. A paediatric dose of EXPAREL 4 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 266 mg was selected based 
on  real-world  evidence  from  paediatric  procedures  performed  at  The  Cleveland  Clinic,  simulated 
pharmacokinetic data, and data from Study 402-C-120.

Treatments 
Subjects in Group 1 were randomly assigned to treatment with EXPAREL 4 mg/kg or bupivacaine HCl 2 
mg/kg. In group 2 all subjects received EXPAREL. 
EXPAREL was formulated as a sterile, non-pyrogenic, white to off-white, preservative-free, homogeneous 
suspension of bupivacaine encapsulated into multivesicular lipid-based particles. 
Bupivacaine in EXPAREL was at a nominal concentration of 13.3 mg/mL. EXPAREL was provided in 20 
mL, 1.3% (13.3 mg/mL) single-use, clear glass vials.  
EXPAREL  could  have  been  expanded  with  normal  (0.9%)  saline  to  increase  the  volume  up  to  a  final 
concentration  of  0.89  mg/mL  (i.e.,  1:14  dilution  by  volume).  The  total  volume  of  expansion  was 
dependent on the incision length. 
Dosing of EXPAREL was based on body weight, at a dose of 4 mg/kg, not to exceed a maximum total 
dose  of  266  mg.  The  study  drug  was  administered  prior  to  wound  closure.  Each  infiltration  site  was 
spaced 1.0 to 1.5 cm apart and approximately 1 to 1.5 mL was delivered into both deep and superficial 
areas. 
The investigators were instructed to document the total volume of expansion used; and calculate the 
total volume for each surgery depending on the incision length. 
In Group 1 subjects in the control arm received Bupivacaine HCl. Dosing of Bupivacaine HCl was based 
on body weight, at a dose of 2 mg/kg, not to exceed a maximum dose of 175 mg.  
Patients could receive postsurgical opioid medication as a rescue medication.  
Objectives 
Primary objective: evaluate the PK of EXPAREL in paediatric subjects aged 6 to <17 years undergoing 
spine or cardiac surgeries. 
Secondary  Objectives:  evaluate  the  safety  of  EXPAREL  in  paediatric  subjects  aged  6  to  <17  years 
undergoing spine or cardiac surgeries.

Safety endpoints:  
Safety assessments consisted of vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, neurological assessments, laboratory tests, 
and AEs. The safety endpoints were assessed at the specified timepoints: 
•  Change from baseline in vital signs (temperature, resting heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen 
saturation, and blood pressure).  
−  Assessment  of  vital  signs  (resting  heart  rate,  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressure, 
temperature, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate) was performed at screening; upon 
arrival in the post-anesthesia care unit; at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 96 hours 
after the end of study drug administration; at hospital discharge; and on Day 30. 
•  Summary  of  neurological  assessments  (subjects  who  were  oriented,  disoriented,  not 
assessable),  numbness  (of  lips,  tongue,  or  around  mouth),  metallic  taste,  hearing  problems, 
vision problems, and muscle twitching. The number and percentage of subjects were tabulated 
for each neurologic assessment for each age group and overall.  
−  Neurological assessment was made at screening; at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 
96 hours after the end of study drug administration; at hospital discharge; and on Day 
30. 
•  Change from baseline in clinical laboratory data.  
−  Clinical  laboratory  tests  (hematology,  chemistry,  and  urinalysis)  were  collected  at 
screening; at baseline (on Day 1 prior to surgery); and at 96 hours after the end of study 
drug administration. 
• 
• 
ECG  tracings,  classified  as  ‘normal,  ‘abnormal  not  clinically  significant’  or  ‘abnormal  clinically 
significant’.” ECGs were assessed at screening or on Day 1 prior to surgery and could also have 
been conducted if a subject experienced an AESI (i.e., cardiac AE or neurological AE), or an SAE. 
Incidence of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) and SAEs until Day 30.

Sample size 
The sample size was based on the number of subjects necessary to characterize the PK profile of EXPAREL 
in paediatric subjects following administration via wound infiltration. The studies were not powered for 
hypothesis testing. 
Randomisation 
Subjects in Group 1 were randomized 1:1 to receive either a single dose of EXPAREL or bupivacaine HCl. 
Subjects in Group 2 received a single dose of EXPAREL.  The randomization code was generated by a 
centralized randomization system, which was also used to communicate subject randomizations to study 
sites. All randomized subjects had both a unique subject identifier and a unique random code identifier. 
No subject or random code identifiers were reused once assigned. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open label study and blinding was not performed. 
Statistical methods 
Continuous  variables  were  summarized  using  descriptive  statistics  [sample  size  (n),  mean,  standard 
deviation (SD), minimum, median, and maximum]. Categorical variables were tabulated with number 
and percentage of subjects. Unless otherwise noted, percentages were based on the number of subjects 
in the treatment group or group within the analysis population and summaries presented data that were 
pooled from all sites.  
Efficacy analysis 
Summary statistics are presented for pain intensity scores at each assessment timepoint. Area under 
the pain-time curve (AUC) is derived using the linear trapezoidal rule on the pain scores. AUC starts with 
the first pain assessment obtained after surgery and use all following pain assessments including those 
collected prior to administration of opioid medication and unscheduled assessments. Summary statistics 
are  presented  for  the  following  pain  intensity  AUCs:  AUCAdjusted(4-24),  AUCAdjusted  (4-48),  AUCAdjusted  (4-72), 
AUCAdjusted(4-96) and AUCAdjusted(4-Hospital Discharge).  
Opioid  consumption  is  converted  to  oral  morphine  equivalent  dose  (MED  mg)  using  the  appropriate 
conversion factor. Total postsurgical opioid dose is calculated through 24, 48, and 72 hours. In addition 
to the descriptive statistics for continuous data, geometric mean (GM) and coefficient of variation (CV) 
is included and mean and SD is excluded. 
Time to first postsurgical use of opioid rescue medication is computed in hours as the date and time of 
the  first  opioid  rescue  medication  minus  the  date  and  time  of  the  end  of  surgery.  If  a  subject  is  not 
administered an opioid rescue medication, the time to first administration is censored at 72 hours after 
surgery  or  at  the  time  of  last  follow-up,  whichever  is  earliest.  Time  to  first  opioid  consumption  is 
summarized by the quartiles (25th, 50th, and 75th), minimum and maximum estimated using Kaplan-
Meier  methods  within  age  group  and  part  of  the  study.  The  quartile  and  the  95%  confidence  limits 
(CONFTYPE=LOGLOG) for each quartile is presented. A Kaplan-Meier plot of the time from end of surgery 
to first opioid rescue medication use will be presented within age group and part of the study, and a log-
rank test p-value of treatment difference shown for group 1.

Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data 
Missing information that could not be obtained through query resolution was imputed on a case-by-case 
basis, in a conservative manner to minimized bias. 
Opioid rescue pain medication usage is a projected amount, if a subject discontinues the study early. If 
a subject is discharged at x<36 hours after end of surgery, the total postsurgical opioid consumption 
through 72 hours is calculated as 72*(D0,x/x), where D0,x is the opioid consumption during the initial x 
hours postsurgery. If a subject is discharged at 36≤x<72hours, the total postsurgical opioid consumption 
through  72  hours  is  calculated  as  D0,x+D2x-72,x0  where  D2x-72,x0 is  the  opioid  consumption  from  2x−72 
hours (exclusive) through x hours (inclusive). For example, if a subject is discharged at x=70 hours, the 
postsurgical 0 to 72 hours opioid consumption will be calculated as the consumption during the first 70 
hours plus the consumption between 70 and 72 hours, which is imputed by the consumption between 
68 and 70 hours. 
Missing pain intensity  scores  were  not  imputed or  replaced in  efficacy  analysis  due to  the descriptive 
nature analyses without formal hypothesis testing.

Recruitment 
The  study  was  conducted  at  15  sites  in  the  United  States.  No  treatment-by-center  analyses  were 
performed. The study period was from 2 April 2019 (first participant was screened) up to 24 September 
2019 (last participant was observed). 
The date of the original CSR was 13 May 2020, and date of amended report was 22 July 2021. 
Conduct of the study 
Six specific changes were made to the clinical study report for Study 402-C-319. However, there was no 
information in study protocol on protocol amendments. 
Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics and baseline characteristics for the PK population are overall similar to those 
for the Safety population. Summary of subject demographics for Safety population is available below.  
Group 1 
According to subject demographic characteristics for the Safety population of Group 1 EXPAREL arm and 
bupivacaine  arm  was  similar.  The  overall  subject  population  was  predominantly  White  (77.0%),  non-
Hispanic (68.9%), and female (82.0%). The mean age was 13.8 years (± 1.32 years). In EXPAREL group 
was more female subjects than bupivacaine group (90.3% vs 73.3%), and in bupivacaine group were 
more white subjects than in EXPAREL group (86.7 vs 67.7%) (Table 23). Subject demographics in PK

Normal  ECG,  baseline  NRS  pain  intensity  and  ASA  classification,  but  it  should  be  considered  as 
preliminary due to the limited sample size (N=5) (Table 26).

Prior, Intraoperative, and Concomitant Medications 
Prior  medications  were  defined  as  medications  with  a  stop  date/time  prior  to  start  of  study  drug 
administration.  Intraoperative  medications  were  defined  as  medications  given  as  part  of  the  surgical 
procedure. Concomitant medications were those taken after the start of study drug administration (i.e., 
started prior to the start of study drug administration and continued after or started after the start of 
study drug administration) and were not designated as intraoperative medications. 
Prior Medications 
Group 1 
In Group 1, at least 1 prior medication was used by 30 EXPAREL subjects (96.8%) and 28 bupivacaine 
subjects (93.3%). The most commonly taken prior medications (≥50% of subjects overall) in Group 1 
were  dexamethasone  (70.5%),  midazolam  (67.2%),  propofol  (65.6%),  fentanyl  (62.3%).  The 
percentages  of  subjects  who  had  used  fentanyl  and  midazolam  were  higher  in  the  EXPAREL  group 
compared  with  the  bupivacaine  HCl  group;  for  fentanyl,  77.4%  and  46.7%,  respectively,  and  for

•  Subjects with coagulopathies or immunodeficiency disorders. 
•  Administration  of  an  investigational  drug  within  30  days  or  5  elimination  half-lives  of  such 
investigational  drug,  whichever  was  longer,  prior  to  study  drug  administration,  or  planned 
administration of another investigational product or procedure during the subject’s participation 
in this study. 
In addition, the subject was ineligible to receive study drug if he or she met the following criterion during 
surgery: 
•  Any  clinically  significant  event  or  condition  uncovered  during  the  surgery  (e.g.,  excessive 
bleeding, acute sepsis) that might have rendered the subject medically unstable or complicated 
the subject’s postoperative course. 
Treatments 
All  subjects  in  this  study  received  a  single  dose  of  EXPAREL  4  mg/kg/bodyweight,  not  to  exceed  a 
maximum total dose of 266 mg. 
EXPAREL was formulated as a sterile, non-pyrogenic, white to off-white, preservative-free, homogeneous 
suspension of bupivacaine encapsulated into multivesicular lipid-based particles. 
Bupivacaine in EXPAREL was at a nominal concentration of 13.3 mg/mL. EXPAREL was provided in 20 
mL, 1.3% (13.3 mg/mL) single-use, clear glass vials.  
EXPAREL could have been administered undiluted or may have been expanded with normal (0.9%) saline 
to increase the volume up to a final concentration of 0.89 mg/mL (ie, 1:14 dilution by volume). The total 
volume of expansion was dependent on the incision length. 
Patients could receive postsurgical opioid medication as a rescue medication. 
Objectives 
Primary  Objective:  The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  the  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of 
EXPAREL in paediatric subjects 12 to less than 17 years of age undergoing spinal surgery. 
Secondary Objectives: The secondary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of EXPAREL in 
paediatric subjects 12 to less than 17 years of age undergoing spinal surgery.

Safety endpoints:  
Safety assessments consisted of vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, neurological assessments, laboratory tests, 
and AEs. The safety endpoints were assessed at the specified timepoints: 
•  Change from baseline in vital signs (temperature, resting heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen 
saturation, and blood pressure).  
−  Assessment  of  vital  signs  (resting  heart  rate,  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressure, 
temperature, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate) was performed at screening; upon 
arrival in the post-anesthesia care unit; at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 96 hours 
after the end of study drug administration; at hospital discharge; and on Day 30. 
•  Summary  of  neurological  assessments  (subjects  who  were  oriented,  disoriented,  not 
assessable),  numbness  (of  lips,  tongue,  or  around  mouth),  metallic  taste,  hearing  problems, 
vision problems, and muscle twitching. The number and percentage of subjects were tabulated 
for each neurologic assessment for each age group and overall.  
−  Neurological assessment was made at screening; at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 
96 hours after the end of study drug administration; at hospital discharge; and on Day 
30. 
•  Change from baseline in clinical laboratory data.  
−  Clinical  laboratory  tests  (hematology,  chemistry,  and  urinalysis)  were  collected  at 
screening; at baseline (on Day 1 prior to surgery); and at 96 hours after the end of study 
drug administration. 
• 
Incidence of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) and SAEs until Day 30. 
Other (efficacy) Endpoints: 
• 
Pain intensity scores.  
−  Pain intensity was assessed at screening; at 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 96 hours 
after the end of study drug administration; immediately prior to each administration of 
postoperative  opioid  pain  management  medication  until  96  hours;  and  at  hospital 
discharge. 
Pain intensity scores were collected using the following instruments: 
− 11-point NRS-R for subjects aged 12 to <17 years 
− Color Analog Scale CAS for subjects aged 6 to <12 years

Sample size 
The sample size was based on the number of subjects necessary to characterize the PK profile of EXPAREL 
in paediatric subjects following administration via wound infiltration. The studies were not powered for 
hypothesis testing. 
Statistical methods 
This was a single-treatment group study, no comparative statistics were performed.  
Continuous  variables  are  summarized  using  descriptive  statistics  [sample  size  (n),  mean,  standard 
deviation (SD), minimum, median, and maximum]. Categorical variables are tabulated with number and 
percentage of subjects. Unless otherwise noted, percentages are based on the number of subjects in the 
population. 
Handling Missing Values 
Any  information  that  is  missing  and  cannot  be  obtained  through  query  resolution  was  imputed,  on  a 
case-by-case basis 
Total Postsurgical Opioid Consumption 
If opioid is taken on the discharge day but time of dosing is missing, it was imputed as time of discharge 
or 12:00 pm on the discharge day, whichever is later. If opioid is taken after the day of discharge and 
time of dosing is missing, it was imputed as 12:00 pm the day after discharge. 
NRS Pain Intensity 
Missing NRS was not imputed when calculating AUC or summarized over time. 
Analysis sets 
Safety: The Safety population consisted of all subjects who underwent the planned surgery and received 
study treatment. All analyses based on the Safety population were by actual treatment received. 
Pharmacokinetic: The PK population consisted of subjects who received study drug and provided at 
least 1 quantifiable plasma concentration. All analyses were by actual treatment received.

All 15 subjects used opioid medications, with a geometric mean total dose of approximately 93 MME over 
96 hours. The median time to first postsurgical opioid medication use was 1.5 hours (range, 0.8 to 6.2) 
(Table 37).

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
MAH has presented comparison of efficacy results from Study 319 (Group 1) and Study 120, however, 
this comparison is not feasible as designs of concerned studies are not sufficiently similar. Thus, these 
results cannot be interpreted as pooled analysis.

Pain Intensity Scores 
Comparison of Efficacy Results from Study 319 and Study 120 
Similar  NRS-R  pain  intensity  scores  were  observed  in  studies  120  and  319  group  1  following  spine 
surgery through 96 hours (Figure 22). Mean NRS-R pain remained between 3 and 5 throughout the study 
treatment periods.

AUC of NRS-R Pain Intensity 
AUC of NRS-R Pain intensity scores in Study 120 were higher than in Study 319 due to differences in 
calculation of AUC between the studies, where the start of the AUC time interval was 0 hours in Study 
120 and 4 hours in Study 319 (Table 38).

Postsurgical opioid use  
Nearly  all  subjects  in  both  studies  regardless  of  treatment  utilized  an  opioid  medication  in  the 
postoperative setting. The geometric mean total postoperative consumption of opioids following spine 
surgery was lower and the median time to first dose was later in Study 120 than Study 319. The Applicant 
explains the difference with differences in standard of care across clinical sites, where Study 120 was a 
single-center study conducted at The Cleveland Clinic whereas Study 319 was conducted at 15 sites in 
the US (Table 39).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The  MAH  has  submitted  two  studies  in  paediatric  subjects  (319  and  120)  that  investigate 
pharmacokinetics and safety of single dose administration in patients 6-17 years of age to support the 
extension of indication. The MAH has compared pharmacokinetic data for EXPAREL in paediatric patients 
6 to <18 years old from Study 319 with matched studies in adults (adult spine surgery from Study 402-
C-117  and  adult  cardiothoracic  surgery  in  Study  402-C-118).  Extrapolation  of  efficacy  assumes  that 
similar systemic exposure in adults and children would lead to similar exposure at effect site and thus 
similar efficacy.  
The  MAH  included  spine  and  cardiac  surgery  in  surgical  models  because  in  these  procedures  highest 
systemic  levels  of  bupivacaine  and  corresponding  risk  for  toxicity  would  be  expected,  therefore 
representing a high-risk population. Inclusion of highly vascular procedures allow to extrapolate EXPAREL 
safety in less invasive procedures, where systemic absorption, possible side effects and toxicity also is 
expected to be lower.  
Dedicated  phase  3  trial  to  evaluate  clinical  efficacy  in  the  setting  of  local  analgesia  in  paediatric 
population ≥6 years of age has not been conducted.

The  extrapolation  of  efficacy  of  Exparel  from  adults  to  paediatric  patients  is  based  on  the  following 
factors: 
1.  a similar pathophysiology of postsurgical pain in paediatric and adult patients 
2.  a  similar  mechanism  of  action,  metabolic  pathway,  and  response  to  intervention  with 
conventional bupivacaine in paediatric and adult patients  
3.  demonstration  of  efficacy  in  two  Phase  3  randomized,  controlled  studies  (bunionectomy, 
haemorrhoidectomy) of Exparel in adults that supported its approval for single-dose infiltration 
to produce postsurgical local analgesia  
4.  confirmation  of  similar  bupivacaine  exposures  from  single-dose  infiltration  of  EXPAREL  in 
paediatric  and  adult  subjects  in  matched  surgical  models  and  anticipated  similar  effect  site 
exposure  
5.  the  systemic  absorption  of  bupivacaine  from  Exparel  was  similar  among  paediatric  and  adult 
subjects in matched surgical procedures. This observation in light of the similar metabolism of 
bupivacaine in paediatric and adult patients supports that the rate of local release of bupivacaine 
from Exparel is similar across age groups. 
There were no dose-response studies performed for 6-17 years old paediatric subjects. Exparel dosing 
was based on body weight, consistent with general standards for dosing of local anesthetics in paediatric 
practice. A dose of 4 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 266 mg was selected based on real-world evidence 
from paediatric procedures performed at The Cleveland Clinic, simulated pharmacokinetic data, and data 
from Study 402-C-120. 
Study  319  was  phase  3,  multicentre,  randomised,  open  label  study  to  evaluate  the  PK  and  safety  of 
Exparel when administered via infiltration in paediatric subjects aged 12 to less than 17 years undergoing 
spine surgery (Group 1), and in paediatric subjects aged 6 to less than 12 years undergoing spine or 
cardiac surgery (Group 2). The efficacy endpoints were measured as exploratory, thus the study was 
not powered to evaluate efficacy and only descriptive data are available.  
AUC values of NRS-R pain intensity score in Study 319, Group 1 show that results for Exparel (4mg/kg) 
are  comparable  to  bupivacaine  (2mg/kg).  Postsurgical  opioid  consumption  data  are  inconclusive  in 
respect of clinically meaningfulness, where nearly all patients required opioids. It should be taken into 
account  that  patients  received  additional  medications  according  to  the  study  site’s  standard  of  care. 
Spinal  and  cardiac  procedures  also had  different  standard  of  care  applied,  where  differences  in  prior, 
intraoperative, and concomitant medications between both groups in study 319 were observed. 
Some descriptive comparison is available for age group ≥12 to 17 years of age that can be regarded as 
supportive efficacy data, while no comparative data is available for lower age group ≥6 to 12 years of 
age. 
Study 120 was an open-label, phase 1 study, its primary and secondary aims were to evaluate PK and 
safety of Exparel in paediatric population 12 to less than 17 years of age in local anaesthesia setting. 
Efficacy  endpoints  were  also  exploratory.  Study  was  too  small,  early  phase  trial  with  no  comparison 
group that precludes any conclusions.  
The  MAH  presented  comparison  of  efficacy  results  from  Study  319  (Group  1)  and  Study  120.  This 
comparison is not feasible as designs of concerned studies are not sufficiently similar to allow for such 
exercise.

2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy endpoints in presented studies suggest that EXPAREL provides pain relief in paediatric patients 
6-17 years of age, but since these were extrapolatory endpoints, no conclusions can be made. 
Efficacy can be inferred from comparative pharmacokinetics studies in adult and paediatric population 
which showed similar systemic exposure. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The purpose of the safety assessment for this procedure is to determine safety profile for the liposomal 
bupivacaine formulation in the paediatric population (6 years and older).  As agreed with PDCO during 
review  of  the  PIP  for  EXPAREL,  the  focus  of  the  EXPAREL  paediatric  development  was  to  obtain 
pharmacokinetic data in children in order to be able to extrapolate the efficacy and safety of EXPAREL in 
adults to children when undergoing similar surgeries. 
Patient exposure 
The MAH has completed two paediatric clinical studies and two adult clinical studies to investigate the 
safe use of EXPAREL as a single-dose infiltration in the paediatric population: 
• Paediatric Clinical Studies: 
o  Study  120:  a  Phase  1,  open-label  study  to  evaluate  the  PK  and  safety  of  local  administration  of 
EXPAREL  4  mg/kg  for  postsurgical  analgesia  in  paediatric  subjects  12  to  less  than  17  years  of  age 
undergoing spinal surgery. 
o Study 319: a multicenter, randomized, open-label study to evaluate the PK and safety of EXPAREL for 
postsurgical analgesia in paediatric subjects aged 6 to less than 17 years undergoing spine or cardiac 
surgery. 
• Adult Clinical Studies: 
o  Study  117:  a  Phase  1,  open-label  study  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  PK  of  local  administration  of 
EXPAREL when administered for postsurgical analgesia in adults undergoing open posterior spinal fusion 
or reconstructive surgery. 
o Study 118: a Phase 1, open-label study to evaluate the safety and PK of EXPAREL when administered 
for postsurgical analgesia in adults undergoing posterolateral thoracotomy.  
Overall,  the  safety  data  are  grouped  into  three  safety  data  pools  for  the  purposes  of  comparative 
analysis:  Paediatric  Clinical  Study  Pool,  Adult  Clinical  Study  Pool,  and  Historical  Infiltration  Pool  (see 
Table  40).  The  Paediatric  Clinical  Study  Pool  and  the  Adult  Clinical  Study  Pool  are  presented  in  this 
Summary of Clinical Safety, while the Historical Infiltration Pool and related comparisons are presented 
in the Integrated Summary of Safety (ISS). The Historical Infiltration Pool is representative of the safety 
profile  of  EXPAREL  in  the  approved  indication  for  its  use  as  a  single-dose  infiltration  to  produce  local 
analgesia.

Table 40: Composition of Safety Pools 
Paediatric Clinical Study Pool 
Key characteristics of studies included in the Paediatric Clinical Study Pool are summarised in Table 41. 
The Paediatric Clinical Study Pool includes all subjects from Study 120 and Study 319 who received study 
drug.  Study  120  evaluated  the  PK  and  safety  of  EXPAREL  in  subjects  aged  12  to  less  than  17  years 
undergoing spine surgery. Study 319 evaluated the PK and safety of EXPAREL in subjects aged 12 to 
less  than  17  years  undergoing  spine  surgery  (Group  1)  and  in  subjects  aged 6  to less  than 12  years 
undergoing  either  spine  or  cardiac  surgery  (Group  2).  Subjects  who  received  bupivacaine  HCl  (i.e., 
subjects from Group 1 of Study 319) are presented separately in this pool. Within study 319, the safety 
of EXPAREL in the younger age group (6 to <12 years) was compared to the older age group (12 to <17 
years).

Adult Clinical Study Pool 
Key characteristics of studies included in the Adult Clinical Study Pool are summarised in Table 42. The 
Adult Clinical Study Pool includes all subjects from Study 117 and Study 118 who received study drug. 
Subjects in both studies were male and female subjects at least 18 years of age or older who underwent

SUMMARY OF RESULTS OF INDIVIDUAL STUDIES 
Paediatric population 
Study 120 (Spine Surgery) 
All 15 treated subjects experienced at least one TEAE during the study (Table 45). All TEAEs were mild 
or  moderate  in  severity.  Three  (20.0%)  subjects  experienced  treatment-emergent  serious  adverse 
events  (TESAEs).  Fourteen  (93.3%)  subjects  experienced  TEAESIs.  There  were  no  deaths  or  TEAEs 
leading to discontinuation. 
Table 45: Overview of TEAEs – Study 120 
A summary of TEAEs experienced by more than one subject is presented in Table 46. The most common 
(reported by >50% of all subjects) TEAEs were anemia (15 subjects [100%]), hypotension (14 subjects 
[93.3%]),  nausea  and  muscle  twitching  (nine  subjects  [60.0%]  each),  and  tachycardia  and  vomiting 
(eight subjects [53.3%] each). One additional subject was noted to have hypotension with onset before 
administration of study medication; thus, this event was not treatment emergent.

1, 19 subjects (61.3%) in the EXPAREL group and 22 subjects (73.3%) in the bupivacaine HCl group 
experienced a TEAE during the study. Most TEAEs in both groups were mild or moderate in severity. Two 
subjects  (6.5%)  in  the  EXPAREL  group  and  five  subjects  (15.7%)  in  the  bupivacaine  HCl  group 
experienced a TEAE considered related to study treatment. Two subjects (6.5%) in the EXPAREL group 
and three subjects (10.0%) in the bupivacaine HCl group experienced a TEAESI. No subject experienced 
a TESAE or discontinued the study because of a TEAE. In Group 2, all five subjects (100%) in the spine 
surgery group and nine subjects (31%) in the cardiac surgery group experienced a TEAE, all of which 
were considered mild or moderate in severity. Three subjects (60.0%) in the spine surgery group and 
none in the cardiac surgery had TEAEs considered related to study treatment. Two subjects (6.9%) in

Summary of Adverse Events 
In subjects treated with EXPAREL in the Paediatric Clinical Study Pool, 60% of subjects experienced at 
least one TEAE during the study. The most commonly reported TEAEs were nausea (27.5%), vomiting 
(27.5%), constipation (25.0%), hypotension (22.5%), anemia (18.8%), muscle twitching (16.3%), and 
vision blurred (13.8%). Twenty subjects (25.0%) experienced at least one TEAE that was considered 
related to study drug. Twenty subjects (25.0%) experienced pre-specified cardiac or neurological AEs, 
and one subject (1.3%) experienced a fall. All TEAESIs were considered not related to EXPAREL. There 
were  no  deaths  or  TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation.  In  subjects  treated  with  bupivacaine  HCl  in  the 
Paediatric Clinical Study Pool, 73.3% of subjects experienced at least one TEAE during the study. The 
most  commonly  reported  TEAEs  were  constipation  (30.0%),  muscle  twitching  (26.7%),  hypotension 
(23.3%),  nausea  (20.0%),  vomiting  (16.7%),  and  tachycardia  (13.3%).  Five  subjects  (16.7%) 
experienced  at  least  one  TEAE  that  was  considered  related  to  study  drug.  Six  subjects  (20.0%) 
experienced pre-specified cardiac or neurological AEs and no subject reported falls. There were no deaths 
or TEAEs leading to discontinuation. 
Comparison Between the Paediatric Clinical Study Pool and the Adult Clinical Study Pool 
The studies in each pool were selected with the intention of presenting matched surgery types in adult 
and paediatric studies to enable a comparison of the PK and safety across age groups and populations 
while limiting the differences in safety (and PK) arising from comparisons of significantly different surgical 
procedures. The surgical procedures selected for the Paediatric Clinical Study Pool and the Adult Clinical 
Study Pool were chosen to be representative of subjects at high risk for safety events due to the high 
vascularity of the selected procedures. Paediatric cardiac surgeries are performed due to congenital heart 
conditions  that  do  not  commonly  present  themselves  in  adult  patients  and,  thus,  there  is  no  exactly 
matching adult cardiac procedure. However, local anesthetic administration into the thoracic region is 
known to lead to rapid absorption of local anesthetics. In the paediatric cardiac patient cohort, EXPAREL 
is administered in and around the open surgical site that encompasses the superficial layers of skin and 
muscle as well as the intercostal spaces. Therefore, the data from Study 118, in which EXPAREL was 
administered  into  the  tissues  surrounding  the  thoracic  space,  are  used  to  support  a  bridge  between

cardiac surgical procedures as studied in Study 319. Given that Study 117 evaluated adult subjects who 
received EXPAREL 266 mg via local wound infiltration in subjects undergoing a high-risk open posterior 
spinal  fusion  procedure  or  reconstructive  surgery,  data  from  Study  117  are  used  to  support  a  bridge 
between adult and paediatric patients for spine surgical procedures as studied in Study 319. Table 58 
shows the comparison of the overview of TEAEs in subjects exposed to EXPAREL in the Paediatric Clinical 
Study Pool to the Adult Clinical Study Pool.

Group  2  (both  in  the  cardiac  surgery  group).  None  of  the  TESAEs  was  considered  related  to  study 
treatment and led to discontinuation from the study or resulted in death. All were mild or moderate in 
severity.

Comparison of TESAEs in paediatric and adult patients 
The incidence of TESAEs by SOC and preferred term in the Paediatric Clinical Study Pool and Adult Clinical 
Study  Pool  is  summarised  in  Table  63.  The  incidence  of  TESAEs  in  the  Adult  Clinical  Study  Pool  was 
higher  than  those  in  the  Paediatric  Clinical  Study  Pool.  Within  the  Paediatric  Clinical  Study  Pool,  the 
incidence of TESAEs was greater in subjects treated with EXPAREL (5 of 80, 6.3%) than bupivacaine HCl 
(0%). However, none of these TESAEs was considered to be related to EXPAREL and all were mild to 
moderate in severity.

Laboratory findings 
Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Hematology and chemistry results were not collected in the Adult Clinical Study Pool.  
The mean change from baseline in erythrocytes, hemoglobin, and hematocrit at 96 hours for EXPAREL-
treated subjects was comparable to bupivacaine-treated subjects.

Table 64: Mean Change from Baseline to 96 hours for Erythrocytes, Hemoglobin and 
Hematocrit – Paediatric Clinical Study Pool 
The mean change from baseline to 96 hours for white blood cells, white blood cell subpopulations, and 
platelets was comparable between the EXPAREL and bupivacaine HCl groups. 
Table 65 presents the shift from baseline to 96 hours for erythrocytes, hemoglobin, and hematocrit. The 
percentage  of  subjects  with  a  shift  from  “normal”  at  baseline  to  “low”  at  96  hours  for  erythrocytes, 
hemoglobin, and hematocrit was comparable EXPAREL and bupivacaine HCl groups. No clinically relevant 
safety  issues  regarding  red  blood  cell  parameters  were  observed  for  EXPAREL  as  compared  with 
bupivacaine HCl in the Paediatric Clinical Study Pool. All 15 subjects from Study 120 experienced a TEAE 
of anemia. All TEAEs of anemia were mild in severity, considered by the investigator to be unrelated to 
study drug, and ongoing at the end of the study. No TEAE of anemia required treatment, was serious, 
or resulted in discontinuation. Hemoglobin values past 96 hours after study drug administration were 
not available. The effect of surgery, including general anesthesia, blood loss, and bleeding as a part of 
invasive surgical procedure, may have resulted in loss of red blood cells and the resultant incidence of 
mild anemia in all subjects. 
Table 65: Shift from Normal Baseline to Low 96 hours Postdose for Erythrocytes, 
Hemoglobin and Hematocrit – Paediatric Clinical Study Pool 
The  mean  change  and  shift  from  baseline  to  96  hours  post  dose  showed  no  clinically  meaningful 
differences between the EXPAREL and bupivacaine HCl groups in chemistry results. 
Safety in special populations 
Sex, Ethnicity, Race, ASA 
Given the low sample size of the Adult Clinical Study Pool, a meaningful comparison of TEAEs by sex, 
ethnic, racial or ASA class subgroups could not be made. However, the overall incidence of TEAEs for 
the EXPAREL pediatric group in these subgroups was generally comparable to that for the Adult Clinical 
Study Pool.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
There were no deaths or TEAEs leading to discontinuation from both Exparel and Bupivacaine HCL group

Post marketing experience 
All the post-marketing experience to date comes from use of the product in the US. Based on internal 
sales data and the assumption that one sold vial of EXPAREL represents one treated patient, more than 
6.5 million patients have received EXPAREL in the post-marketing setting to date. On an ongoing basis, 
Pacira’s Pharmacovigilance/Medical group reviews the medical/scientific literature (using the Medline and 
Embase  databases)  for  abstracts/articles  describing  adverse  experience  reports  with  EXPAREL. 
Healthcare professionals, consumers, and company representatives report AEs via company hotlines or 
email at drugsafety@pacira.com. Medical Information and license partners/company affiliates also report 
AE information via the drug safety email address. The procedures by which the information from these 
sources  is  evaluated  and  appropriate  information  entered  into  Pacira’s  global  safety  database  are 
described  in  the  company’s  Pharmacovigilance  standard  operating  procedures  (i.e.,  Management  and 
Reporting  of  Spontaneous  Adverse  Reports,  Pharmacovigilance  Literature  Searches),  and,  when 
applicable, in safety data exchange agreements with Pacira partners. EXPAREL is not subject to enhanced 
or special pharmacovigilance activities and there are no risk minimization programs ongoing for EXPAREL 
in  the US.  Because  adverse  reactions  reported  during  post-marketing  are  reported  voluntarily  from  a 
population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a 
causal relationship to drug exposure. 
The  adverse  reactions  reported  during  post-marketing  are  consistent  with  those  observed  in  clinical 
studies and most commonly involve the following SOCs: Injury, Poisoning, and Procedural Complications 
(e.g., drug-drug interaction, procedural pain), Nervous System Disorders (e.g., palsy, seizure), General 
Disorders And Administration Site Conditions (e.g., lack of efficacy, pain), Skin And Subcutaneous Tissue 
Disorders (e.g., erythema, rash), and Cardiac Disorders (e.g., bradycardia, cardiac arrest). Review of 
these events against the current approved US labelling for EXPAREL has not identified any new safety 
concerns  and  no  changes  to  the  product  labelling  have  been  required  for  safety  reasons  since  initial 
approval. 
Two  spontaneous  ADRs  pertaining  to  the  Eye  Disorders  SOC  were  reported  during  the  postmarketing 
period up to 8 Jun 2021. 
2020000052 (Product administered to patient of inappropriate age, Vision blurred) from a pharmacist 
concerns a 16-year-old patient of unknown gender who received EXPAREL (batch#, dosage and route 
unknown) for an unspecified indication and experienced near and far blurred vision. 
2018000013 (Hypoventilation, Oxygen saturation decreased, Vision blurred, Tachycardia, Somnolence, 
Agitation,  Product  administered  to  patient  of  inappropriate  age)  was  from  a  literature  article  that 
evaluated the incidence of LAST in paediatric surgical patients receiving liposomal bupivacaine compared 
to plain bupivacaine for surgical wound infiltration (Cohen et al, 2018). 
Post-marketing spontaneous ADRs in patients <18 years were reviewed up to 8 Jun 2021 for inclusion 
in Table ADR in children.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The MAH is seeking to extend the Exparel liposomal indication to children from 6 -17 years for a field 
block  for  treatment  of  somatic  postoperative  pain  from  small-  to  medium-sized  surgical  wounds. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/794139/2022  
Page 98/107 
 
 
 
Paediatric studies were conducted according to the approved Paediatric Investigation Plan. The overall 
safety pool comprises data from both paediatric and adult clinical studies. The MAH provided paediatric 
safety  data  from  conducted  studies  and  post-marketing  experience.  Paediatric  safety  pool  is  rather 
limited (N=80) bearing in mind proposed broad paediatric indication. The patients were exposed to the 
proposed Exparel dose of 4 mg/kg (up to 266 mg). Primary focus of assessment is paediatric safety pool. 
The adult safety pool data are also presented in the dossier. It is claimed that adult studies (117, phase 
I,  open  posterior  spinal  fusion  or  reconstructive  surgery  setting;  and  118,  phase  I,  posterolateral 
thoracotomy)  are  chosen  as  similar  and  thus  comparable  to  paediatric  studies  (319  and  120).  Adult 
safety pool comprises of only 19 patients. For age group ≥12 to 17 years of age there are comparative 
data from Study 319, Group 1 (Exparel vs bupivacaine HCl), but with a very limited sample sizes (N=30 
per study arm). For lower age group of ≥6 to 12 years of age, there are no comparative data. Some 
comparison is possible to adult studies. 
The MAH provided additional discussion on the safety profile in paediatric population in relation to the 
standard of care in the EU, ropivacaine. A comparison to bupivacaine and to theoretical similarities of PK 
profiles for ropivacaine and Exparel were discussed. Data revealed no major safety difference between 
bupivacaine and ropivacaine. Conclusions on no immediate safety issue identified are based on expected 
similarities of PK profiles of Exparel and ropivacaine.  
Safety database for the lower age subgroup ≥6 to 12 years of age is rather limited (N=34). It is argued 
that a size of paediatric database has been agreed within the PIP and SAs. The MAH explanation on the 
safety data for lower age subgroup ≥6 to 12 years of age relies on the predicted similarity of PK profiles 
for  adults  receiving  Exparel  266  mg  and  paediatric  patients  receiving  Exparel  4  mg/kg  in  matching 
surgical procedures. 
Additionally, historical safety data pool has been presented and analysed offering relatively large safety 
population of 998 adult patients exposed to EXPAREL. Paediatric safety pool included male and female 
patients  stratified  in  two  age  groups  -  6  to  12  years  and  12  to  17  years  old.  The  presented  safety 
population is in line with the key binding elements of the approved PIP and is deemed appropriate for 
the purpose of this procedure.  
Bupivacaine is an active substance with well known safety profile. As agreed with PDCO during review 
of the PIP for EXPAREL, the focus of the Exparel paediatric development was to obtain pharmacokinetic 
data in children. If the PK profile in adults and children are similar, then the extrapolation exercise can 
support safety. 
Adverse events 
TEAEs  were  more  frequently  reported  in  adult  safety  pool  compared  to  paediatric  patients,  and  most 
frequently in EXPAREL group compared to Bupivacaine HCI group, though all were mild to moderate.  
Pooled safety data from the two studies in the paediatric population and the two studies in adults has 
been presented. All studies were reviewed for major safety events and safety events of special interest. 
The MAH has presented safety data from individual paediatric studies and adult studies, as well as pooled 
safety analysis for paediatric population and comparison of paediatric and adult pools. Paediatric safety 
population has two age subgroups - 6-12 years and 12 to 17 years, as well as patients were stratified 
by surgery type.  
In the Study 120 EXPAREL 4 mg/kg has been administered in paediatric patients from 12 to less than 
17 years for postsurgical local analgesia following spine surgery. All patients experienced at least one 
TEAE. All AEs were mild to moderate. Most frequently reported AE was anaemia that was likely due to 
blood loss during the surgery. Other most commonly reported AEs were hypotension, nausea, vomiting 
and muscle twitching.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/794139/2022  
Page 99/107 
 
 
 
In the Study 319 EXPAREL has been administered in paediatric patients from 12 to less than 17 years 
(Group 1) and 6 to 12 years (Group 2). In Group 1 patients were randomised 1:1 either to EXPAREL 4 
mg/kg arm or Bupivacaine HCI 2 mg/kg arm. In Group 2 all patients were exposed to EXPAREL 4 mg/kg 
dose. Safety findings from this study were rather similar to those reported from Study 120. In Group 1 
slightly  lower  incidence  of  TEAEs  were  reported  in  the  EXPAREL  group  (61.3%)  compared  to  the 
Bupivacaine HCI (73.3%). All but one AE in the Bupivacaine HCI group were moderate or mild. TEAEs 
reported  from  Study  319  were  generally  similar  to  those  reported  from  Study  120.  In  the  SOC  of 
Gastrointestinal  disorders  markedly  higher  incidence  of  nausea  (32.3%)  and  vomiting  (29%)  were 
reported  in  the  EXPAREL  group  compared  to  Bupivacaine  HCI  group  -  nausea  (20%)  and  vomiting 
(16.7%).  While the proportions of patients reporting nausea and vomiting were numerically higher in 
the  EXPAREL  group  than  the  Bupivacaine  HCl  group  in  Group  1  (12  to  <17  years)  of  Study  319,  the 
differences for both nausea and vomiting represent an absolute difference of only 4 patients per group 
(i.e., 10 vs 6 for nausea, and 9 vs 5 for vomiting). The MAH provided additional analyses of the Local 
Analgesia Pool in adults from the original MAA to compare the incidence of nausea and vomiting with 
EXPAREL and Bupivacaine HCl. With a much larger sample size (1,109 EXPAREL, 604 Bupivacaine  HCl),  
there was no evidence of an imbalance between  EXPAREL and Bupivacaine  HCl in  nausea or vomiting,  
specifically, or for the Gastrointestinal disorders SOC. 
In Adult studies most of patients experienced at least one TEAE. None of them were considered related 
to EXPAREL exposure.  
The MAH presented a good comparison of safety data across studies, as well as between Paediatric safety 
pool and Adult safety pool. Most common AEs in Paediatric Clinical Study Pool were nausea (27.5%), 
vomiting  (27.5%),  constipation  (25%),  hypotension  (22.5%),  anaemia  (18.8%),  muscle  twitching 
(16.3%). There were some TEAEs such as pruritus (11.6% vs 6.7%), bradycardia (8.8% vs 0), muscle 
spasms (8.8% vs 0), tachypnoea (8.8% vs 3.3%) reported with higher incidence in the EXPAREL group 
compared to the Bupivacaine HCI group. However, these differences appear to be likely related to the 
site-effect.  Some  AEs  were  more  frequently  reported  with  Exparel  for  single  site  study  compared  to 
multi-centre study suggesting that these findings might be affected by AE’s reporting bias.    
Serious adverse events and death 
Three TEASAEs were reported in two subjects in the younger age group (6 - 12 y) from Study 319. 
Both patients were in the cardiac surgery group. The MAH argues that none of them were considered as 
related to Exparel. In the SOC of Gastrointestinal disorders, vomiting vas reported in one patient as a 
TESAE. According to narrative, this SAE indeed unlikely was related EXPAREL exposure as it started on 
day 8 post-surgery. No TESAEs were reported in Spinal surgery group and Group 1 (12 - 17 y).  
TESAEs were reported in three subjects from Study 120 in the SOCs of Musculoskeletal and connective 
tissue disorders and Nervous system disorders. The MAH provided details on these reported cases and 
there appears no plausible relationship with Exparel and SAEs.  
Overall incidence of TESAEs was rather low in both adult and paediatric pools. There were no significant 
differences observed between both pools. Based on available data, no increased risk to LAST related AEs 
was identified in EXPAREL exposed paediatric patients. However, due to a very small sample size, definite 
conclusion on LAST incidence in Exparel exposed patients compared to overall bupivacaine data cannot 
be driven.   
AEs of special interest 
Incidences of AESIs (25%) were not negligible in the paediatric safety pool; with most frequent those 
pertaining to SOC Cardiac disorders (20%) and SOC Neurologic disorders (7.5%).  
Laboratory findings 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/794139/2022  
Page 100/107 
 
 
 
Haematology  and  chemistry  tests  were  collected  only  in  paediatric  patients.  Shift  from  baseline  was 
assessed  96  hours  post-surgery.  TEAE  of  anaemia  was  reported  in  all  patients  and  the  Applicant’s 
arguments that this AE is likely due to blood loss during the surgery is generally supported.  
The MAH provided detailed analysis of the clinical biochemistry findings. No systemic exposure related 
safety concerns for Exparel exposed patients were identified.  
Discontinuation due to AEs 
Four  patients  discontinued  from  study  in  the  Paediatric  pool  (2  from  EXPAREL  group  and  2  from 
Bupivacaine  HCL  group)  due  to  lost  to  follow-up.  No  patients  discontinued  from  study  due  to  TEAEs. 
There were no TEAEs leading to discontinuation in Adult clinical study pool.  
Postmarketing experience 
Bupivacaine is a well known active substance widely used in paediatric patients therefore 
postmarketing safety data reported for conventional bupivacaine formulation might also be relevant 
and collaborate to establishing safety profile for liposomal bupivacaine. 
 As  for  this  application,  available  postmarketing  safety  data  on  liposomal  bupivacaine  is  of  particular 
interest. Post-marketing paediatric cases are discussed in the dossier in relation to ADRs determination 
process. 61 individual case histories pertaining to number of SOCs were submitted and two spontaneous 
ADR reports for liposomal bupivacaine were identified in paediatric patients. Exparel was administered 
in paediatric patients off-label as it was not authorised for paediatric patients at the time of procedure 
submission, and exact details are missing. In light of this, it is not possible to adequately assess clinical 
relevance of safety findings from the above reports. 
Adverse Drug Reactions  
The proposed ADR table in paediatric population is based on an evaluation of treatment-related TEAEs 
and TEAEs observed in children treated with Exparel in the Paediatric Clinical Study Pool, spontaneous 
post-marketing ADRs in patients <18 years up to 8 Jun 2021 and what is known about the safety of 
Exparel  and  bupivacaine  in  adults.  Anaemia  was  also  added  to  the  ADRs  table  (in  children)  in  the 
proposed PI, with frequency ‘very common’, due to the high incidences of anaemia observed in Exparel 
treated  patients,  and  as  at  least  suspected  causality  cannot  be  ruled  out  based  on  the  comparative 
incidences from clinical trials.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Submitted safety data in paediatric patients does not indicate any serious safety concerns and overall 
EXPAREL safety profile in paediatric patients seems not markedly different compared to safety profile in 
adult  patients.  The  overall  safety  data  did  not  reveal  any  specific  safety  issues  in  paediatric  patients 
compared to Bupivacaine HCL group and adult population exposed to liposomal bupivacaine. However, 
it should be noted that paediatric safety database is very limited and therefore conclusions should be 
made with great caution especially for lower age subgroup of ≥6 to 12 years of age.

leaflet will not be affected by the proposed revisions. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Acute pain occurs as a result of tissue damage and postoperative pain is a manifestation of inflammation 
due  to  tissue  injury  or  nerve  injury,  or  both.  The  aetiology  and  underlying  physiology  of  postsurgical 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/794139/2022  
Page 102/107 
 
 
 
 
pain is similar in paediatric and adult patients. During the postoperative period, pain manifests itself with 
maximum intensity during the first 24 hours, reducing progressively.   
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In both paediatric and adult patients, multimodal analgesia which incorporates two or more agents, is 
the standard of care for postoperative pain management. The current treatment options for postsurgical 
analgesia include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), local anaesthetics, acetaminophen, 
opioids,  N-methyl-D-aspartate  antagonists,  and  α2-adrenergic  agonists;  the  specific  components  of 
effective multimodal care vary depending on the patient, setting, and surgical procedure.   
Bupivacaine is a well-known active substance widely used in paediatric patients. It is one of the longer-
acting  local  anaesthetics,  but  it  has  a  duration  of  action  of  approximately  4-8  hours.    The  expected 
benefits of Exparel (bupivacaine encapsulated into multivesicual liposomes) administration would include 
extended duration of post-surgical pain relief. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Efficacy is extrapolated from adults to paediatric patients based on: 
•  Similarity of pathophysiology of postsurgical pain in paediatric and adult patients 
•  Similarity of mechanism of action, metabolism and response to treatment with bupivacaine HCl 
in paediatric and adult patients 
•  Demonstration  of  efficacy  of  Exparel  in  two  Phase  3  randomized,  controlled  studies 
(bunionectomy,  haemorrhoidectomy)  that  supported  approval  of  field  block  indication  for 
treatment of somatic post-operative pain from small- to medium-sized surgical wounds 
•  Similarity  of  the  exposures  achieved  in  paediatric  and  adult  patients  in  matching  surgical 
procedures and assumed similar effect site exposure 
•  Similarity of systemic absorption of bupivacaine from Exparel in paediatric and adult patients in 
matching surgical procedures that support similar local release of bupivacaine from Exparel. 
The MAH submitted two paediatric studies and two previously assessed adult studies to support extension 
of indication to patients from 6 years of age: 
•  Study 120: a phase 1, open-label, pharmacokinetic and safety study used to support the dosing 
of  4  mg/kg  (up  to  maximum  dose  of  266  mg)  in  Study  319  and  to  provide  supportive 
pharmacokinetic and safety data on EXPAREL for the proposed indication. All paediatric patients 
(12 to < 17 years) treated in this study underwent a spinal surgery.  
•  Study  319:  a  Phase  3,  open-label,  pharmacokinetic  and  safety  study  supporting  the  use  of 
EXPAREL for local infiltration. Paediatric subjects aged 12 to < 17 years underwent spinal surgery 
(Group 1). 6 to < 12 years participants underwent spinal or cardiac surgery (Group 2). Group 1 
included  bupivacaine  HCL  as  a  comparator.  The  study  was  used  as  basis  for  extrapolation  of 
efficacy. 
Two additional studies in matching surgical procedures in adult subjects who received EXPAREL 266 mg 
via local infiltration were submitted: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/794139/2022  
Page 103/107 
 
 
 
 
•  Study  117:  a  phase  1,  open-label  study  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  pharmacokinetics  of  local 
administration of EXPAREL when administered for prolonged postsurgical analgesia in subjects 
undergoing open posterior spinal fusion or reconstructive surgery.  
•  Study 118:a phase 1, open-label study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of EXPAREL 
when administered for postsurgical analgesia in subjects undergoing posterolateral thoracotomy.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
PK  comparison  of  Exparel  4  mg/kg  vs  bupivacaine  HCl  2  mg/kg  in  Study  319,  Group  1  showed  that 
Exparel exhibits similar PK properties as already observed in adult subjects; slower absorption and more 
sustained  bupivacaine  concentrations,  in  line  with  the  extended  release  of  bupivacaine  from  the 
multivesicular liposomes. The observed Cmax was lower and Tmax later in the Exparel group, with two 
maximums present in most subjects. 
Descriptive comparison of exploratory endpoints of AUC values of NRS-R pain intensity score in Study 
319, Group 1 (spine surgery in adolescents 12-17 years old) showed generally similar results between 
Exparel and bupivacaine HCl groups. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Submitted studies were not designed and powered to make any conclusions about the efficacy. 
There  is  no  direct  correlation  between  the  absolute  plasma  concentration  of  bupivacaine  and 
concentration at the site of action. It is assumed that a similar plasma pharmacokinetic profile observed 
in adults and children would lead to similar local tissue site concentrations and thus indicate a similar 
therapeutic efficacy.  
There was no formal dose selection studies. Instead, the dose of 4 mg/kg (up to 266 mg) was selected 
based on registry data and modelling. The actual administered dose in the clinical practice will depend 
on the clinician's judgement of the size of the surgical wound, the volume required to cover the area and 
individual patient factors.  
Due  to  the  sparse  PK  sampling  schemes,  all  PK  comparisons  were  based  on  population  PK  modelling 
rather  than  direct  comparison  of  observed  values  across  groups.  Lower  systemic  exposures  were 
observed in pediatric population compared to adult population, thus similarity of systemic exposures and 
the impact on efficacy extrapolation was questioned. The applicant provided new population PK modeling 
to demonstrate that the differences observed are due to different absolute dose administered in adults 
(a fixed dose of 266 mg) and children (4 mg/kg dose, up to a maximum of 266 mg).  
No statistical analysis was performed to evaluate similarity of the exposure between paediatric and adult 
population in matching surgical procedures. The comparison is rather of descriptive manner and there 
were no pre-defined criteria to establish similarity in exposures. It is acknowledged that no therapeutic 
range exists for systemic bupivacaine and therefore formal demonstration of statistical similarity in PK 
parameters would not be informative.  
Based  on  Pop  PK  model  simulations,  the  characteristic  shape  of  the  PK  profile  between  adults  and 
paediatric subjects appears similar. The exposure based on both Cmax and AUC was lower in children 
and adolescents compared to adult subjects for both surgical models (spine and cardiac) however this 
might be more indicative of safety rather than efficacy.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The purpose of the safety assessment is to determine safety profile for a new formulation of liposomal 
bupivacaine.  The  overall  safety  data  does  not  reveal  any  specific  safety  issues  in  paediatric  patients 
compared to Bupivacaine HCL and adult population.  
Both paediatric surgical models (spine and cardiac surgery) are highly vascular and can be regarded as 
procedures  of  highest  risk  for  systemic  toxicity.  Therefore,  it  is  considered  acceptable  to  extrapolate 
safety results to the less invasive procedures included in the indication. Provided PK data suggest that 
highest Cmax observed was below the levels associated with safety concerns in adult. 
In the pooled paediatric data, the most frequently reported AEs were nausea (27.5%), vomiting (27.5%), 
constipation (25.0%), hypotension (22.5%), muscle twitching (16.3%), and vision blurred (13.8%). 
In the pooled paediatric set in Exparel-treated subjects, five (6.3%) subjects had serious adverse events: 
flank pain, muscular weakness, vomiting, wound infection fungal, paraesthesia, and dyspnoea. None of 
the TESAEs resulted in study discontinuation or death. 
Incidences of AEs of special interest (25%) were not negligible in the paediatric safety pool; with most 
frequent those pertaining to SOC Cardiac disorders (20%) and SOC Neurologic disorders (7.5%). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Paediatric safety pool is rather limited (N=80), especially for children 6 to < 12 years of age. Additionaly, 
for lower age subgroup there are no comparative safety data. Only some comparison to adult studies is 
possible.  
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The paediatric studies were not designed nor powered to evaluate efficacy.  
The efficacy is extrapolated from adults based on the assumption that similar plasma PK profiles between 
children and adults in matching surgeries would mean similar local release of bupivacaine from Exparel 
liposomal. It is acknowledged that systemic concentrations are not directly correlated to a magnitude of 
analgesic effect. 
There  is  similar  pathophysiology  of  postsurgical  pain  between  paediatric  and  adult  patients  based  on 
data from literature. Mechanism of action, metabolic pathway and response to bupivacaine is also similar 
between paediatric and adult patients based on data from literature. Efficacy of Exparel in adults has 
been demonstrated in two Phase 3 randomized, controlled studies (bunionectomy, haemorrhoidectomy) 
that supported its approval as a field block for treatment of somatic post-operative pain from small- to 
medium-sized surgical wounds. 
PK profiles of bupivacaine following field block with Exparel in paediatric and adult subjects in matched 
surgical  models  suggest  similar  and  characteristic  local  release  of  bupivacaine  from  Exparel.  The 
magnitude  of  differences  in  PK  parameters  observed  between  adult  and  paediatric  subjects  can  be 
regarded  as  largely  similar  to  the  differences  expected  in  adults  due  to  different  absolute  dose 
administered and are not expected to influence efficacy. Paediatric exposure remaining below the adult 
exposure supports the safety of the proposed paediatric 4 mg/kg dose.

Both paediatric surgical models (spine and cardiac surgery) are highly vascular and can be regarded as 
procedures  of  highest  risk  for  systemic  toxicity.  Therefore,  it  is  considered  acceptable  to  extrapolate 
safety results to the less invasive procedures included in the indication.  
Safety  profile  in  paediatric  patients  seems  not  markedly  different  compared  to  safety  profile  in  adult 
patients. However, paediatric safety database is limited, what is particularly emphasized for the younger 
age subgroup of 6 to < 12 years of age. 
Based  on  the  data  provided,  the  efficacy  of  Exparel  as  a  field  block  for  treatment  of  somatic  post-
operative pain from small- to medium-sized surgical wounds in adults can be extrapolated to paediatric 
patients 6 years and older. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Based on the presented data, it can be concluded that benefit-risk balance for Exparel liposomal use in 
children aged 6 years or older to reduce somatic postoperative pain from small- to medium-sized 
surgical wounds is favourable. 
3.6.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
During the procedure, CHMP asked for the PDCO consultation. PDCO was invited to comment if provided 
PK data along with findings of exploratory clinical data endpoints could be considered sufficient evidence 
to support extension of indication to paediatric patients, in particular for the 6-12 years age group. In 
response,  PDCO  supported  proposed  extrapolation  concept  and  considered  that  the  PK  profiles  were 
sufficiently  similar,  whereas  predicted  lower  Cmax  was  considered  indicative  of  safety.  PDCO 
acknowledged  that  controlled  efficacy  study  is  not  feasible  in  paediatric  population.  In  addition, 
therapeutic need for children was emphasised by the PDCO, considering prolonged-release formulation 
allows to decrease adverse effects, which is even more important in younger age groups. 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Exparel liposomal is positive.

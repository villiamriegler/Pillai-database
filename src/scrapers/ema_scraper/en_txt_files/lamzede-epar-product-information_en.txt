CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of non-neurological manifestations in patients with 
mild to moderate alpha-mannosidosis. See sections 4.4 and 5.1. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
The treatment should be supervised by a physician experienced in the management of patients with 
alpha-mannosidosis or in the administration of other enzyme replacement therapies (ERT) for 
lysosomal storage disorder. Administration of Lamzede should be carried out by a healthcare 
professional with the ability to manage ERT and medical emergencies. 
Posology 
The recommended dose regimen is 1 mg/kg of body weight administered once every week by 
intravenous infusion at a controlled speed. 
The effects of treatment with velmanase alfa should be periodically evaluated and discontinuation of 
treatment considered in cases where no clear benefits could be observed. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No data are available and no relevant use in elderly patients is described. 
Renal or hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

Paediatric population 
No dose adjustment is necessary for the paediatric population. 
Method of administration 
For intravenous infusion use only. 
Instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration 
The reconstituted solution should be clear. Do not use if opaque particles are observed or if the 
solution is discoloured (see section 6.6). 
The reconstituted solution of Lamzede should be administered using an infusion set equipped with a 
pump and an in-line low protein-binding 0.22 µm filter. The infusion duration should be calculated 
individually considering a maximum infusion rate of 25 mL/hour to control the protein load. The 
infusion duration should be a minimum of 50 minutes. A slower infusion rate may be prescribed when 
clinically appropriate according to the physician’s judgment, for example at the beginning of the 
treatment or in case of previous infusion-related reactions (IRRs). 
For the calculation of the infusion rate and the infusion time based on body weight see the table in 
section 6.6. 
The patient should be observed for IRRs for at least one hour after the infusion according to clinical 
conditions and the physician’s judgment. For further instructions, see section 4.4.  
Home infusion 
Infusion of Lamzede at home may be considered for patients who are tolerating their infusions well. 
The decision to have a patient move to home infusion should be made after evaluation and 
recommendation by the treating physician. Patients experiencing infusion-related reactions, including 
hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylactic reactions, during the home infusion need to immediately 
reduce the infusion rate or to stop the infusion process considering the severity of the reaction and 
seek the attention of a healthcare professional. Dose and infusion rate in home setting should remain 
the same used in the hospital setting; they could be changed only under the supervision of a healthcare 
professional and treating physician. 
Appropriate training should be given by the treating physician and/or nurse to the patient and/or 
caregiver prior to initiation of home infusion. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Severe allergic reaction to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
General consideration on the treatment 
As the accumulation of end organ damage progresses over time, it is more difficult for the treatment to 
reverse the damage or to show improvements. As with other enzyme replacement therapies, velmanase 
alfa does not cross the blood-brain-barrier. It should be considered by the treating physician that the 
administration of velmanase alfa does not affect the irreversible complications (i.e. skeletal 
deformities, disostosis multiplex, neurological manifestations and impaired cognitive function).  
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hypersensitivity 
Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients in clinical studies. Appropriate medical 
support should be readily available when velmanase alfa is administered. If severe allergic or 
anaphylactic-type reactions occur, immediate discontinuation of velmanase alfa is recommended and 
current medical standards for emergency treatment are to be followed. 
Infusion-related reaction  
Administration of velmanase alfa may result in an IRR, including anaphylactoid reaction (see 
section 4.8). The IRRs observed in clinical studies of velmanase alfa were characterised by a rapid 
onset of symptoms and were of mild to moderate severity.  
The management of IRRs should be based on the severity of the reaction and includes slowing the 
infusion rate, treatment with medicinal products such as antihistamines, antipyretics and/or 
corticosteroids, and/or stopping and resuming treatment with increased infusion time. Pre-treatment 
with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids may prevent subsequent reactions in those cases where 
symptomatic treatment was required. Most of the patients were not routinely pre-medicated prior to 
infusion of velmanase alfa during clinical studies. 
In case symptoms such as angioedema (tongue or throat swelling), upper airway obstruction or 
hypotension occur during or immediately after infusion, anaphylaxis or an anaphylactoid reaction 
should be suspected. In such a case, treatment with an antihistamine and corticosteroids should be 
considered as being appropriate. In the most severe cases, the current medical standards for emergency 
treatment are to be observed.  
The patient should be kept under observation for IRRs for one hour or longer after the infusion, 
according to the treating physician’s judgement. 
Immunogenicity 
Antibodies may play a role in treatment-related reactions observed with the use of velmanase alfa. To 
further evaluate the relationship, in instances of development of severe IRRs or lack or loss of 
treatment effect, patients should be tested for the presence of anti-velmanase alfa antibodies. In case 
the patient’s condition deteriorates during ERT, cessation of treatment should be considered. 
There is a potential for immunogenicity.  
In the exploratory and pivotal clinical studies at any time under treatment, 8 patients out of 33 (24%) 
developed IgG-class antibodies to velmanase alfa.  
In a paediatric clinical study in patients below 6 years, 4 patients out of 5 (80%) developed IgG-class 
antibodies to velmanase alfa. In this study, the immunogenicity test was performed with a different 
and more sensitive method and therefore the incidence of patients developing IgG-class antibodies to 
velmanase alfa was higher but not comparable to data of the previous studies. 
No clear correlation was found between antibody titres (velmanase alfa IgG antibody level) and 
reduction in efficacy or occurrence of anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity reactions.  
The development of antibodies has not been shown to affect clinical efficacy or safety. 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of velmanase alfa in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition 
or postnatal development (see section 5.3). As velmanase alfa aims at normalizing alpha-mannosidase 
in alpha-mannosidosis patients, Lamzede is not recommended to be used during pregnancy unless the 
clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with velmanase alfa. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether velmanase alfa or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Nevertheless, the 
absorption of any ingested milk-containing velmanase alfa in the breastfed child is considered to be 
minimal and no untoward effects are therefore anticipated. Lamzede can be used during breastfeeding. 
Fertility 
There are no clinical data on the effects of velmanase alfa on fertility. Animal studies do not show 
evidence of impaired fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Lamzede has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions observed were weight increase (15%), IRRs (13%), diarrhoea 
(10%), headache (7%), arthralgia (7%), increased appetite (5%) and pain in extremity (5%).  
The majority of these adverse reactions were non-serious. IRRs include hypersensitivity in 3 patients 
and anaphylactoid reaction in 1 patient. These reactions were mild to moderate in intensity.  
A total of 4 serious adverse reactions (loss of consciousness in 1 patient, acute renal failure in 
1 patient, chills and hyperthermia in 1 patient) were observed. In all cases the patients recovered 
without sequelae. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The adverse reactions reflecting exposure of 38 patients treated with velmanase alfa in clinical studies 
are listed in the table 1 below. Adverse reactions are classified by system organ class and preferred 
term according to the MedDRA frequency convention. Within each frequency grouping, adverse 
reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness. Frequency is defined as very common 
(≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1 000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000),

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Infusion-related reaction 
IRRs (including hypersensitivity, cyanosis, nausea, vomiting, pyrexia, chills, feeling hot, malaise, 
urticaria, anaphylactoid reaction and hyperhidrosis) were reported in 13% of the patients (5 out of 
38 patients) in clinical studies. All were mild or moderate in severity and 2 were reported as a serious 
adverse reaction (see section 5.1). All patients who experienced IRRs recovered. 
Acute renal failure 
In the clinical studies, one patient experienced acute renal failure considered possibly related to the 
study treatment. Acute renal failure was of moderate severity leading to temporary discontinuation of 
the study treatment and fully resolved within 3 months. Concomitant long-term treatment with high 
doses of ibuprofen was noted during the occurrence of the event. 
Loss of consciousness 
In one patient, one event of loss of consciousness was reported during the treatment in the clinical 
trials. The event occurred 8 days after last infusion and after 14 months of treatment. A connection to 
the test drug could not be ruled out despite the long period from last infusion and until the event 
occurred. The patient recovered within few seconds and was taken to the hospital, where she/he 
received sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion and was then discharged after 6-hour 
observation. The patient continued in the study with no change in dose level. 
No other related event of loss of consciousness has been reported either in the clinical either in the 
commercial setting. 
Paediatric population 
Children age below 6 years old 
A total of 5 patients with alpha-mannosidosis below 6 years received velmanase alfa in a clinical 
study. The safety profile was similar to that observed in the previous studies, with similar frequency, 
type and severity of adverse events.  
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Children age group 6 to 17 years old 
The safety profile of velmanase alfa in clinical studies involving children and adolescents was similar 
to that observed in adult patients. Overall, 58% of patients (19 out of 33) with alpha-mannosidosis 
receiving velmanase alfa in clinical studies were aged 6 to 17 years at the start of the study. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is no experience with overdose of velmanase alfa. The maximum dose of velmanase alfa in 
clinical studies was a single administration of 100 units/kg (approximately corresponding to 
3.2 mg/kg). During the infusion with this higher dose, fever of mild intensity and short duration 
(5 hours) was observed in one patient. No treatment was administered.  
For the management of adverse reactions, see sections 4.4 and 4.8.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism products, enzymes. 
ATC code: A16AB15. 
Mechanism of action 
Velmanase alfa, the active substance of Lamzede, is a recombinant form of human alpha-mannosidase. 
The amino acid sequence of the monomeric protein is identical to the naturally occurring human 
enzyme, alpha-mannosidase. 
Velmanase alfa is intended to supplement or replace natural alpha-mannosidase, an enzyme that 
catalyses the sequential degradation of hybrid and complex high-mannose oligosaccharides in the 
lysosome, reducing the amount of accumulated mannose-rich oligosaccharides.  
Clinical efficacy and safety 
A total of 33 patients enrolled in the exploratory and pivotal studies (20 males and 13 females, ranging 
in age from 6 to 35 years) were exposed to velmanase alfa in five clinical studies. Patients were 
diagnosed based on alpha-mannosidase activity <10% of normal activity in blood leukocytes. Patients 
with the most severe rapidly progressing phenotype (with a deterioration within one year and central 
nervous system involvement) were excluded. Based on this criteria mild to moderate patients, 
presenting heterogeneous severity with ability to perform endurance tests, large variability of clinical 
manifestations and age of onset were enrolled.  
Overall effects of treatment were evaluated in the domains of pharmacodynamics (reduction of serum 
oligosaccharides), functional (three-minute stair climbing test (3MSCT), six-minute walking test 
(6MWT), and forced vital capacity (FVC) % predicted) and quality of life (childhood health 
assessment questionnaire (CHAQ) disability index (DI) and CHAQ VAS pain (visual analogue 
scale)). 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the phase 3 pivotal multi-centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel group study 
rhLAMAN-05, the efficacy and safety of repeated administrations of velmanase alfa over 52 weeks at 
a dose of 1 mg/kg given weekly as intravenous infusion were investigated. A total of 25 patients were 
enrolled, including 12 paediatric subjects (age range: 6 to 17 years; mean: 10.9 years) and 13 adult 
subjects (age range: 18 to 35 years; mean: 24.6). All but one patient were naïve to the treatment with 
velmanase alfa. In total 15 patients (7 paediatrics and 8 adults) received active treatment and 
10 patients received placebo (5 paediatrics and 5 adults). The results (serum oligosaccharide 
concentration, 3MSCT, 6MWT and FVC%) are presented in table 2. A pharmacodynamic effect with 
statistically significant decrease of serum oligosaccharides in comparison to placebo was 
demonstrated. The results observed in patients below 18 years of age showed an improvement. In 
patients over 18 years old a stabilisation has been demonstrated. The numerical improvement of most 
clinical endpoints over placebo (2 to 8%) observed in the year of observation could be suggestive of 
the ability of velmanase alfa to slow down the existing disease progression.

The long-term efficacy and safety of velmanase alfa was investigated in the uncontrolled, open label, 
phase 3 clinical study rhLAMAN-10 in 33 subjects (19 paediatrics and 14 adults, from 6 to 35 years at 
treatment initiation) who previously participated in velmanase alfa studies. An integrated database was 
created by pooling cumulative databases from all studies with velmanase alfa. Statistically significant 
improvements were detected in serum oligosaccharide levels, 3MSCT, pulmonary function, serum IgG 
and EQ-5D-5L (euro quality of life-5 dimensions) over time, up to the last observation (table 3). The 
effects of velmanase alfa were more evident in patients younger than 18 years.

Data suggest that the beneficial effects of the treatment with velmanase alfa diminish with the increase 
of disease burden and disease-related respiratory infections. 
A post-hoc multiparametric responders analysis supports the benefit of longer treatment with 
velmanase alfa in 87.9% of responders in at least 2 domains at last observation (table 4).

Children below 6 years old 
Use of velmanase alfa in the children below 6 years is supported by the evidence of the clinical study 
rhLAMAN08. 
Overall, there were no safety issues from use of velmanase alfa in paediatric patients below 6 years of 
age with alpha-mannosidosis. Four of 5 patients developed anti-velmanase alfa antibodies during the 
study, and 3 patients developed neutralising/inhibitory antibodies. Two Patients (both anti-velmanase 
alfa antibodies positive) experienced a total of 12 IRRs, all manageable, with no event leading to 
discontinuation of study treatment. Two IRRs were assessed as serious and resolved on the same day 
of occurrence. Premedication before infusion was used, when necessary, as a measure to further 
reduce risks related to IRRs. Efficacy analysis demonstrated reduction in concentrations of serum 
oligosaccharides, increase in IgG levels, and suggested improved endurance and hearing. Lack of 
accumulation of velmanase alfa at steady state and the safety/efficacy results confirm that the dose of 
1 mg/kg is appropriate in paediatric patients (aged below 6 years). The study suggests benefits of early 
treatment with velmanase alfa in children aged below 6 years. 
Children age group 6 to 17 years old 
Use of velmanase alfa in the age group 6 to 17 years is supported by evidence from clinical studies in 
paediatric (19 out of 33 patients enrolled in the exploratory and pivotal studies) and adult patients.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
There were no apparent pharmacokinetic gender differences in patients with alpha-mannosidosis 
disease.  
Absorption  
Lamzede is administered through intravenous infusion. At steady-state after weekly infusion 
administration of 1 mg/kg of velmanase alfa, the mean maximum plasma concentration was about 
8 µg/mL and was reached at 1.8 hours after the start of administration corresponding to the mean 
infusion duration time.  
Distribution 
As expected for a protein of this size, the steady-state volume of distribution was low (0.27 L/kg), 
indicating distribution confined to plasma. The clearance of velmanase alfa from plasma (mean 
6.7 mL/h/kg) is consistent with a rapid cellular uptake of velmanase alfa via mannose receptors. 
Biotransformation 
The metabolic pathway of velmanase alfa is predicted to be similar to other natural occurring proteins 
that degrade into small peptides and finally into amino acids.  
Elimination 
After the end of the infusion, velmanase alfa plasma concentrations fell in a biphasic fashion with a 
mean terminal elimination half-life of about 30 hours.  
Linearity/(Non)linearity 
Velmanase alfa exhibited a linear (i.e. first-order) pharmacokinetic profile, and Cmax and AUC 
increased proportionally to the dose with doses ranging from 0.8 to 3.2 mg/kg (corresponding to 25 
and 100 units/kg). 
Special populations 
Renal or hepatic impairment 
Velmanase alfa is a protein and is predicted to be metabolically degraded into amino acids. Proteins 
larger than 50 000 Da, such as velmanase alfa, are not eliminated renally. Consequently, hepatic and 
renal impairment are not expected to affect the pharmacokinetic of velmanase alfa.  
Elderly (≥65 years old) 
As no patients older than 41 years have been identified across Europe, no relevant use in elderly 
patients is expected.  
Paediatric population 
Pharmacokinetic data from paediatric patients recapitulate the data from the adult population. In 
particular, lack of accumulation of velmanase alfa at steady state, as well as the safety/efficacy data, 
confirm that the dose of 1 mg/kg is appropriate also in patients younger than 6 years. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, juvenile toxicity and toxicity to reproduction and development.

The number of vials to be used should be calculated based on the individual patient’s weight. 
The recommended dose of 1 mg/kg is determined using the following calculation:  
- 
- 
Patient’s weight (kg) × dose (mg/kg) = Patient dose (in mg). 
Patient dose (in mg) divided by 10 mg/vial (content of one vial) = number of vials to 
reconstitute. If the number of calculated vials includes a fraction, it should be rounded up 
to the next whole number.  
Approximately 30 minutes prior to reconstitution, the required number of vials should be 
removed from the refrigerator. The vials should reach ambient temperature (between 
15°C and 25°C) prior to reconstitution. 
- 
Each vial is reconstituted by slowly injecting 5 mL of water for injections to the inside of the 
wall of each vial. Each mL of reconstituted solution contains 2 mg of velmanase alfa. Only the 
volume corresponding to the recommended dose should be administered. 
Example:  
- 
- 
- 
Patient’s weight (44 kg) × dose (1 mg/kg) = Patient dose (44 mg). 
44 mg divided by 10 mg/vial = 4.4 vials, therefore, 5 vials should be reconstituted. 
From the total reconstituted volume, only 22 mL (corresponding to 44 mg) should be 
administered. 
The powder should be reconstituted in the vial by a slow drop-wise addition of the water for 
injections down the inside of the vial and not directly onto the lyophilised powder. Forcefully 
ejecting the water for injections from the syringe onto the powder should be avoided to 
minimise foaming. The reconstituted vials should stand on the table for about 5-10 minutes. 
Thereafter each vial should be tilted and rolled gently for 15-20 seconds to enhance the 
dissolution process. The vial should not be inverted, swirled, or shaken. 
An immediate visual inspection of the solution for particulate matter and discoloration should 
be performed after reconstitution. The solution should be clear and not used if opaque 
particles are observed or if the solution is discoloured. Due to the nature of the medicinal 
product, the reconstituted solution may occasionally contain some proteinaceous particles in 
form of thin white strands or translucent fibers which will be removed by the in-line filter 
during infusion (see point e).  
The reconstituted solution is to be slowly withdrawn from each vial with caution to avoid 
foaming in the syringe. If the volume of the solution exceeds one syringe capacity, the required 
number of syringes should be prepared in order to replace the syringe quickly during the 
infusion.  
The reconstituted solution should be administered using an infusion set equipped with a pump 
and an in-line low protein-binding 0.22 μm filter.  
The total volume of infusion is determined by the patient’s weight and should be administrated 
over a minimum of 50 minutes. It is recommended to use always the same dilution (2 mg/ml). 
For patients weighing less than 18 kg, and receiving less than 9 mL reconstituted solution, the 
infusion rate should be calculated so that the infusion time is ≥50 minutes. The maximum 
infusion rate is 25 mL/hour (see section 4.2). The infusion time can be calculated from the

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Lamzede is and what it is used for 
Lamzede contains the active substance velmanase alfa which belongs to a group of medicines known 
as enzyme replacement therapies. It is used to treat patients with mild to moderate alpha-mannosidosis 
disease. It is given for the treatment of non-neurological symptoms of the disease. 
Alpha-mannosidosis disease is a rare genetic disorder caused by a lack of an enzyme named 
alpha-mannosidase, which is needed to break down certain sugar compounds (called ‘mannose-rich 
oligosaccharides’) in the body. When this enzyme is missing or does not work properly, these sugar 
compounds build up inside cells and cause the signs and symptoms of the disease. The typical 
manifestations of the disease include distinctive facial features, mental retardation, difficulty in 
controlling movements, difficulties in hearing and speaking, frequent infections, skeletal problems, 
muscle pain and weakness. 
Velmanase alfa is designed to replace the missing enzyme in patients with alpha-mannosidosis 
disease.  
2.  What you need to know before you use Lamzede 
Do not use Lamzede 
- 
if you are allergic to velmanase alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor before Lamzede is used. 
Hypersensitivity reactions may occur with the administration of Lamzede. These reactions usually 
appear during or soon after the infusion and may manifest with several symptoms, such as localised or 
diffuse skin reactions, gastrointestinal symptoms or swelling of the throat, face, lips or tongue (see 
section 4 “Possible side effects”). If the hypersensitivity reaction is severe, immediate discontinuation 
of Lamzede is recommended and current medical standards for emergency treatment are to be 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
followed. Less severe hypersensitivity reactions may be managed by temporary interruption of the 
infusion or by slowing down infusion rate; administration of medicines used to treat allergy may be 
considered by the physician. 
If you are treated with Lamzede, you may experience a side effect during or immediately following 
the drip (infusion) used to give the medicine (see section 4 “Possible side effects”). This is known as 
an infusion-related reaction and can sometimes be severe. 
- 
Your doctor may decide to keep you under observation for one hour or longer after the infusion 
in relation to the infusion related reactions. 
Infusion-related reactions include dizziness, headache, nausea, low blood pressure, tiredness and 
fever. If you experience an infusion-related reaction, you must tell your doctor immediately. 
If you have an infusion-related reaction you may be given additional medicines to treat or help 
prevent future reactions. These medicines may include medicines used to treat allergies 
(antihistamines), medicines used to treat fever (antipyretics) and medicines to control 
inflammation (corticosteroids). 
If the infusion-related reaction is severe, your doctor will stop the infusion immediately and 
start giving you appropriate medical treatment. 
If the infusion-related reactions are severe and/or there is a loss of effect from this medicine, 
your doctor will perform a blood test to check for antibodies that might affect the outcome of 
your treatment. 
Most of the time you can still be given Lamzede even if you experience an infusion-related 
reaction. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Antibodies may play a role in hypersensitivity and infusion related reactions observed with the use of 
Lamzede. Although 24% of patients developed antibodies against Lamzede during its clinical 
development, no clear correlation was found between antibody titres and reduction in efficacy or 
occurrence of hypersensitivity reactions. 
Other medicines and Lamzede 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before this medicine is used. 
You should not take this medicine during pregnancy unless your doctor states it is clearly necessary. 
Your doctor will discuss that with you. 
It is not known whether velmanase alfa passes into breast milk. Lamzede can be used during breast-
feeding since the velmanase alfa will not be absorbed by a breastfed child. 
Driving and using machines 
Lamzede has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Lamzede contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose unit, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to use Lamzede 
This medicine is only to be used under the supervision of a doctor experienced in the treatment of 
alpha-mannosidosis or other similar diseases and should only be given by a healthcare professional.  
Lamzede is only used under the supervision of a doctor who is knowledgeable in the treatment of 
Alpha Mannosidosis disease. Your doctor may advice that you can be treated at home provided you 
meet certain criteria. Please contact your doctor if you would like to be treated at home. 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dose 
The recommended dose of Lamzede is 1 mg/kg of body weight given once every week.  
Use in children and adolescents 
Lamzede may be given to children and adolescents at the same dose and frequency as in adults.  
Administration 
Lamzede is supplied in a vial as a powder for infusion which will be made up with water for injections 
before being given. 
Once it has been made up, the medicine will be given by infusion pump (drip) into a vein over a 
period of at least 50 minutes under your doctor’s supervision.  
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.

This medicine has been authorised under ‘exceptional circumstances’. This means that because of the 
rarity of this disease it has been impossible to get complete information on this medicine. 
The European Medicines Agency will review any new information on this medicine every year and 
this leaflet will be updated as necessary. 
Other sources of information 
Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: 
http://www.ema.europa.eu. There are also links to other websites about rare diseases and treatments. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only. 
Lamzede requires reconstitution and is intended for intravenous infusion only.  
Each vial is for single use only. 
Instructions for reconstitution and administration  
Lamzede should be reconstituted and administrated by a healthcare professional. 
Aseptic technique is to be used during preparation. Filter needles must not be used during preparation. 
a) 
The number of vials to be used should be calculated based on the individual patient’s weight. 
The recommended dose of 1 mg/kg is determined using the following calculation:  
- 
Patient’s weight (kg) × dose (mg/kg) = Patient dose (in mg). 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
Patient dose (in mg) divided by 10 mg/vial (content of one vial) = number of vials to 
reconstitute. If the number of calculated vials includes a fraction, it should be rounded up 
to the next whole number.  
Approximately 30 minutes prior to reconstitution, the required number of vials should be 
removed from the refrigerator. The vials should reach ambient temperature (between 
15°C and 25°C) prior to reconstitution. 
Each vial is reconstituted by slowly injecting 5 mL of water for injections to the inside of the 
wall of each vial. Each mL of reconstituted solution contains 2 mg of velmanase alfa. Only the 
volume corresponding to the recommended dose should be administered. 
Example:  
- 
- 
- 
Patient’s weight (44 kg) × dose (1 mg/kg) = Patient dose (44 mg). 
44 mg divided by 10 mg/vial = 4.4 vials, therefore, 5 vials should be reconstituted. 
From the total reconstituted volume, only 22 mL (corresponding to 44 mg) should be 
administered. 
b) 
c) 
d) 
e) 
The powder should be reconstituted in the vial by a slow drop-wise addition of the water for 
injections down the inside of the vial and not directly onto the lyophilised powder. Forcefully 
ejecting the water for injections from the syringe onto the powder should be avoided to 
minimise foaming. The reconstituted vials should stand on the table for about 5-10 minutes. 
Thereafter each vial should be tilted and rolled gently for 15-20 seconds to enhance the 
dissolution process. The vial should not be inverted, swirled, or shaken. 
An immediate visual inspection of the solution for particulate matter and discoloration should 
be performed after reconstitution. The solution should be clear and not used if opaque 
particles are observed or if the solution is discoloured. Due to the nature of the medicinal 
product, the reconstituted solution may occasionally contain some proteinaceous particles in 
form of thin white strands or translucent fibers which will be removed by the in-line filter 
during infusion (see point e).  
The reconstituted solution is to be slowly withdrawn from each vial with caution to avoid 
foaming in the syringe. If the volume of the solution exceeds one syringe capacity, the required 
number of syringes should be prepared in order to replace the syringe quickly during the 
infusion.  
The reconstituted solution should be administered using an infusion set equipped with a pump 
and an in-line low protein-binding 0.22 μm filter.  
The total volume of infusion is determined by the patient’s weight and should be administrated 
over a minimum of 50 minutes. It is recommended to use always the same dilution (2 mg/ml). 
For patients weighing less than 18 kg, and receiving less than 9 mL reconstituted solution, the 
infusion rate should be calculated so that the infusion time is ≥50 minutes. The maximum 
infusion rate is 25 mL/hour. The infusion time can be calculated from the following table:

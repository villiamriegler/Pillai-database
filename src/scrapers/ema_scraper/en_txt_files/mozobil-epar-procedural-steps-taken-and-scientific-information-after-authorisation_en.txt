The MAH submitted a study which aim was to investigate 
address FUM003.4/MEA003.4. The objective of the 
study was to investigate whether there is a 
difference in tumour engraftment and progression 
when injecting rodents with tumour cells which do 
not express CXCR4 compared with tumour cells 
expressing CXCR4. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
whether there was a difference in tumour engraftment and 
progression when injecting SCID mice with tumour cells 
which do not express CXCR4 compared with tumour cells 
expressing CXCR4. Results of this study indicate that 
expression of CXCR4 on tumour cells may enhance tumour 
engraftment and thus increase the risk of disease relapse. 
However, a conclusion on whether the risk of relapse due 
to contaminating tumour cells is greater following G-CSF + 
plerixafor when compared to G-CSF mobilisation alone 
cannot be drawn based on this experiment.

SmPC and 
The MAH submitted the results of the general receptor 
5.3 of the SmPC to include additional nonclinical 
safety pharmacology data regarding the effects of 
plerixafor on receptors other than CXCR4. These 
data are provided as part of the FUM 002 as agreed 
by the CHMP at the time of initial marketing 
auhtorisation. 
Sections 4.5 and 5.2 of the SmPC are also updated 
to include in vitro pharmacokinetics data regarding 
the evaluation of plerixafor for P-glycoprotein 
substrate or inhibition potential. 
Furthermore, the MAH submitted an updated RMP to 
reflect the new available data. Consequently the 
version number of the RMP (version 2) was updated 
in Annex II. 
The MAH also took the opportunity to update the 
Product Information in line with the latest QRD 
template. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics 
Annex II 
radioligand binding study, the results of a patch clamp 
study investigating the effect of plerixafor on Ca-channels 
expressed in mammalian cells and an evaluation of the P-
Glycoprotein substrate and inhibition potential of plerixafor 
using MDCKII-MDR1 cells. 
The receptor screening shows that plerixafor has moderate 
or strong binding affinity for a number of different 
receptors predominantly located on pre-synaptic nerve 
endings in the CNS and/or the PNS (N-type calcium 
channel, potassium channel SKCA, histamine H3, 
acetylcholine muscarinic M1 and M2, adrenergic alpha-1B 
and alpha-2C, neuropeptide Y/Y1 and glutamate NMDA 
polyamine receptors). An interaction of plerixafor with one 
or more of these receptors could be responsible for 
plerixafor-induced acute toxicity signs observed in animal 
studies. This information has been added to section 5.3 of 
the SmPC. 
The study submitted evaluating P-gp substrate and 
inhibition potential of plerixafor in well characterized in 
vitro cell systems shows that plerixafor is not a substrate 
for the P-gp transporter and does not inhibit this 
transporter. Based on the results of this study, sections 4.5 
and 5.2 of the SmPC were updated. 
The results of these studies were also taken into account in 
an updated RMP. Annex II of the product information was 
also updated to reflect the new version number of the RMP 
(version 2). 
Furthermore, the Product Information was updated in line

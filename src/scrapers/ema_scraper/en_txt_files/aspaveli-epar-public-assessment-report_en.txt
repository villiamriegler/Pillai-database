2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
PNH is a rare, chronic, life-threatening blood disorder associated with anemia due to hemolysis. 
Hemolysis can result in a range of debilitating consequences such as severe fatigue, chest pain, and 
transfusion dependence, all of which contribute to the heavy disease burden and reduced quality of life 
(QoL) these patients experience. Even with C5 inhibitor treatment, 72% of patients with PNH remain 
anemic and 36% require 1 or more transfusions per year (McKinley et al. 2017). If left untreated, PNH 
can cause severe and potentially fatal complications for patients. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
PNH has an annual incidence of 1-10 new cases per 1 million individuals. The median age of diagnosis 
is in the early thirties; it affects men and women in equal proportions and has no clear ethnic or 
geographic preferences (Stern and Connell 2019). 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
PNH is characterized by chronic complement-mediated hemolysis, which most commonly occurs as a 
consequence of a somatic mutation in the phosphatidylinositol glycan class A (PIGA) gene. This genetic 
mutation causes impaired glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis and deficient GPI-anchored 
complement regulatory proteins on the surface of mature blood cells, rendering these cells susceptible 
to complement attack (Schrezenmeier et al. 2020). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation and diagnosis  
PNH is associated with a high burden of disease. The most prevalent symptoms are fatigue (80%), 
dyspnea (64%), and hemoglobinuria (62%). PNH commonly results in clinically significant hematologic 
consequences from chronic hemolysis including a marked increase in risk of thromboembolism, which 
may ultimately lead to target organ damage and death (Schrezenmeier et al. 2014). 
2.1.5.  Management 
To most effectively manage PNH, both IVH and EVH need to be controlled. This is reflected in 
improvements across the following key markers of disease activity: hemoglobin level, LDH level, ARC, 
bilirubin level, transfusion requirements, and FACIT-Fatigue score. The C5 inhibitors eculizumab and 
ravulizumab, the only currently available treatments, have increased survival and improved outcomes 
in PNH by controlling IVH, reflected in LDH improvements; however, C5 inhibitors do not control EVH. 
In many patients treated with C5 inhibitors, although LDH is largely controlled, ARC and bilirubin levels 
remain elevated, indicative of ongoing hemolysis. Despite the availability of eculizumab over the past 
13 years, patients remain symptomatically limited by their disease and still require PRBC transfusion 
because not all key markers of disease activity are meaningfully improved. Considering the available 
therapies, there is no unmet medical need. However, new therapies that provide more complete 
control are needed.

2.2.  About the product 
Pegcetacoplan is formed by a pentadecapeptide (combining a bioactive cyclic tridecapeptide C3-
inhibiting moiety and a 2–amino acid linker) covalently coupled to each end of a linear 40-kDa 
polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain, so there are 2 peptide moieties per molecule of pegcetacoplan. 
Pegcetacoplan (Pharmacotherapeutic group: Selective immunosuppressants) binds to complement 
protein C3 and its activation fragment C3b with high affinity, thereby regulating the cleavage of C3 and 
the generation of downstream effectors of complement activation. 
The claimed indication is treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) in adult patients 
that have previously received standard therapy haemoglobinuria.  
Pegcetacoplan is administered twice weekly as a 1,080 mg subcutaneous infusion with a commercially 
available syringe system infusion pump. The twice weekly dose should be administered on day 1 and 
day 4 of each treatment week. For the first 4 weeks, pegcetacoplan is administered as twice weekly 
subcutaneous doses of 1,080 mg in addition to the patient’s current dose of C5 inhibitor treatment to 
minimize the risk of haemolysis with abrupt treatment discontinuation. After 4 weeks, the patient 
should discontinue C5 inhibitor before continuing on monotherapy with pegcetacoplan. 
Before receiving treatment with pegcetacoplan, in patients with a known history of vaccination, it is 
recommended to ensure that patients have received vaccines against encapsulated bacteria including 
Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis types A, C, W, Y, and B, and Haemophilus 
influenzae Type B (Hib) within 2 years prior to starting Pegcetacoplan. For patients without known 
history of vaccination, it is recommended to administer the required vaccines at least 2 weeks prior to 
receiving the first dose of pegcetacoplan. If immediate therapy with pegcetacoplan is indicated, it is 
recommended to administer required vaccine as soon as possible and provide patients with 2 weeks of 
prophylactic antibiotic therapy. 
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
Early clinical evaluation (CP0514, 204, 202 studies) of repeated dosing of pegcetacoplan in subjects 
with PNH was conducted, and pegcetacoplan demonstrated pharmacological activity at an SC dosage of 
180 mg/day, but an improved efficacy response was observed at an SC dosage of 270 to 360 mg/day. 
On the basis of the efficacy observed in the Phase 1b/2a clinical trials and to reduce the burden of daily 
dosing, a twice-weekly dose of 1080 mg by SC infusion was selected for pivotal Phase 3 ongoing APL2-
302 study on the basis of preliminary pharmacokinetic (PK) modelling. 
Others phase 3 studies are ongoing: the extension APL2-307 study and APL2-308 study assessing 
efficacy and safety of pegcetacoplan in patients with PNH compared to standard of care excluding 
complement inhibitors. 
On 12 June 2017 the Applicant requested protocol assistance (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/579653/2017) for 
APL-2-301 study assessing patients receiving 270 mg/day of pegcetacoplan in order to support the 
indication for the treatment of patients with PNH with inadequate response to eculizumab. As the 
Applicant was not planning to conduct the APL2-301 protocol, a further follow up advice was requested 
on 6 November 2017 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/100648/2018) for APL2-302 study. The study design was 
generally agreed upon. However, it was recommended to extend the active-comparator controlled 
period to provide more long-term data on the endpoints of interest. This recommendation was not 
followed by the Applicant, however, efficacy and safety data beyond the controlled period have been 
submitted from an open label period. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/629737/2021  
Page 12/150 
 
 
 
The Applicant was advised to randomise before run-in and not afterwards and to blind the study (using 
a “double-dummy” design) to minimise the risk of bias with open label design. This advice was also not 
adhered to, however, the applicant submitted an exhaustive argumentation to address the CHMP 
concerns regarding the study design.  
The application included an EMA Decision(s) EMEA-002600-PIP01-19 on the agreement of a paediatric 
investigation plan P/0149/2020. The clinical measures were the following studies: 
- Study 1 (APL2-PNH-209): Open label, multiple dose trial to evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety and 
activity of pegcetacoplan in children from 12 to less than 18 years of age with anaemia due to PNH 
who are treatment naive or who remain anaemic despite treatment with a complement inhibitor. The 
study initiation and completion is deferred with the date of completion due by April 2024. 
- Study 2 (APL2-PNH-003): Use of population PK model to analyse PK data collected in paediatric 
studies to inform dosing recommendation in paediatric subjects. The initial population modelling 
analysis report is available and has been provided with the compliance check package. Thus, the date 
of initiation of study 2 is compliant. The completion of this measure is deferred with completion 
expected by September 2024. 
- Study 3 (APL2-PNH-004): Use of population PK/PD and E-R model of existing in-house clinical data 
on pegcetacoplan to support efficacy assumptions in the paediatric population based on extrapolation. 
The study initiation and completion are deferred with the date of completion due by April 2024.

biological attributes, including biopotency by ELISA and thermodynamic properties by isothermal 
calorimetry. 
The active substance is a white to off-white solid, very soluble in both water and buffer (10 mM acetate 
buffer, pH 5.0 containing 4.1% sorbitol), and freely soluble in both ethanol and 5% dextrose solution. 
At 25 °C, pegcetacoplan displays negligible adsorption of water at moderate relative humidity (RH) 
levels (less than 3% water adsorption at RH ≤ 65%) and low to moderate water adsorption at high 
relative humidity levels (~6% water adsorption at 85% RH). 
All the chiral amino acids contain the L configuration. The peptide portions contain two unnatural 
amino acids: 1-methyl-L-tryptophan (Trp(Me)) in position 4 and amino(ethoxyethoxy)acetic acid 
(AEEA) in position 14. The polyethylene glycol bridging the two peptides consists of 900 repeating 
units representing a nominal mass of 40 kDa and is covalently linked to the side chains of each lysine 
residue of each peptide.

The crystallinity of the active substance is not critical to the bioavailability of the finished product since 
the product is administered as a solution for infusion. Hence the absence of polymorphism discussion 
in the dossier is acceptable. 
2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The manufacture of the active substance consists of eight specific stages. 
The starting materials are Rink Amide AM Resin, the protected amino acids and PEG Diol (40K) and 
they are considered acceptable with acceptable specifications. The starting materials are commercially 
available. 
A detailed description of each stage of the manufacturing process is provided. Critical process 
parameters (CPP) and their proven acceptable ranges are described. In-process tests are listed for 
each stage of the manufacturing process. 
The process description provided by the applicant is very detailed and consistent with standard 
chemistry and controls for SPPS. This high level of detail provides a large degree of assurance that the 
process will be under sufficient control. Critical steps and controls have been identified and the 
designation of them as critical/non-critical is acceptable based on the multiple chromatographic 
purification steps used in the process. Holding times and storage conditions for process intermediates 
were established based on data generated during development, stability studies, and/or manufacturing 
experience and are acceptable. 
In-process controls applied during the synthesis are described. The specifications and control methods 
for critical steps, intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development program. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have 
been justified. 
Potential and actual impurities are described in detail. A detailed summary of the genotoxic 
assessment performed for each pegcetacoplan manufacturing process reagent, solvent, and potential 
by-products, raw materials and intermediates produced during manufacturing of the activated PEG 
intermediate and the peptide intermediate is provided. All compounds were classified either as ICH M7 
class 5 or as ICHQ3C class 2 except for acetamide for which a PDE is established. 
The active substance is packaged in an LDPE bag which complies with the European Union Regulations 
EU/10/2011, and EC/1935/2004. The secondary packaging is an opaque aluminium-lined laminate bag 
that provides protection from light. 
2.4.2.3.  Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual), identification (MALDI-TOF-MS 
and RP-HPLC), assay (RP-HPLC), purity (RP-HPLC), related substances (RP-HPLC, SE-HPLC, SEX-
HPLC), water content (KF), residual organic solvents (HS GC-FID), acetate content (IC), bioassay 
(ELISA), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and microbial enumeration (Ph. Eur.). 
The applicant has provided a detailed and sound justification of the proposed limits in line with ICH 
Q6A. An acceptable toxicological justification has been provided for those impurities where the 
respective limit is above the Ph. Eur. qualification threshold (1.0%).  
Assessment report

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data for 11 process validation and post process validation batches of the active 
substance have been provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to 
batch. 
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
Stability data from three batches of active substance from the proposed active substance manufacturer 
stored in a container closure system representative of that intended for the market for up to 18 
months under long term conditions (- 20°C ± 5 °C) and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions (5 ± 3°C) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Two of these batches were 
manufactured at the proposed commercial size while one batch was approximately one half of the 
commercial size. For these three batches, the activated PEG intermediate used to produce the active 
substance was manufactured at pilot scale by the site of manufacture for this intermediate used during 
development. The use of batches with intermediate from this site is acceptable based on the 
comparability data provided. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, purity, related substances, water content, 
impurities, bioassay, bacterial endotoxins and microbial enumeration. The analytical methods used 
were stability indicating. All tested parameters were within the specifications. 
The PEG intermediate manufacturing process was scaled up at the site proposed for commercial 
manufacturing. Stability data are available for four additional active substance lots using PEG 
intermediate from this site. To date, stability data through 12-months at the long-term and 6-months 
under the accelerated condition are available. No significant trends were observed, and the tested 
samples met the proposed commercial active substance specification. The results from these studies 
support the comparability assessment. 
Forced  degradation  studies  were  conducted  and  pegcetacoplan  was  exposed  to  thermal,  aqueous 
hydrolytic,  acidic,  basic,  and  oxidative  stress  conditions.  Results  of  these  studies  showed  that 
pegcetacoplan  is  susceptible  to  degradation  under  aqueous  hydrolytic,  acidic,  basic,  and  peroxide 
oxidative conditions. No significant change in purity and related impurities by RP-HPLC was observed in 
pegcetacoplan samples exposed to thermal stress conditions. 
Photostability  testing  following  ICH  guideline  Q1B  was  performed  on  one  batch.  The  photostability 
characteristics of pegcetacoplan were evaluated by exposing the active substance and a dark control to 
light conditions that meet or exceed the conditions for confirmatory studies specified in ICH Q1B, Section 
1B Option 1. Samples were tested for appearance, appearance of solution, purity and related substances 
(RP-HPLC, SE-HPLC, SCX-HPLC) and bioassay. The data indicate that there is no change in the colour 
and physical form of the exposed samples. In addition, no change was observed in the clarity or colour 
of  a  sample  solution.  No  visible  impurities  were  observed  in  any  of  the  samples.  The  data  show  a 
significant decrease in the purity accompanied by an increase in impurities. A decrease in bioassay is 
also observed. Therefore, it can be concluded that pegcetacoplan shows significant sensitivity to visible 
and/or UV light exposure. 
The proposed 18-month retest period for pegcetacoplan stored at -20 ± 5°C (-20°C) protected from light 
is considered acceptable. The available accelerated stability data (6 months at 5°C) support short-term 
excursions outside the proposed label storage condition of -20°C during handling.

2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Pegcetacoplan solution for subcutaneous infusion, 1080 mg is a sterile aqueous, acetate-buffered 
sorbitol solution for parenteral administration.  
The qualitative composition of the finished product is presented in the table below: 
Table 1: composition of the finished product 
No overages are used in the pegcetacoplan finished product formulation, however an overfill is used. 
An acceptable justification for the overfill volume has been provided. 
The active substance concentration was set to deliver the required amount (1080 mg) in a 20 mL 
infusion dosage form. The active substance, pegcetacoplan, is is a symmetrical molecule comprised of 
two pentadecapeptides covalently bound to the ends of a linear 40 kDa polyethylene glycol molecule. 
The active substance is a lyophilized amorphous solid of low bulk density which is freely soluble to very 
soluble in aqueous solutions. Consequently, there are no risks to achieve complete dissolution to a final 
concentration of 54 mg/mL during finished product manufacturing.  
The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. All excipients are well known 
pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel 
excipients used in the finished product formulation. The excipients and the quantities used are 
common in the manufacture of this type of dosage form and considered safe in the proposed 
concentrations. Their functions are adequately described. Sorbitol is used as a tonicity agent. Glacial 
acetic acid is used as a buffering agent and for pH adjustment. Sodium acetate trihydrate is used as a 
buffering agent. Sodium hydroxide is used for pH adjustment and water is used as solvent. Excipients 
were selected based on the route of administration and the need to stabilize the active substance in 
solution. Acetate buffer was selected based on the pH of optimal stability of the active substance, 
which is within an acceptable pH range known for subcutaneous administration. The buffer 
concentration of 10 mM acetate is adequate to maintain the pH over the proposed shelf life of the 
product.  
Data from the different formulation development studies demonstrate the compatibility of 
pegcetacoplan with the selected excipients.  
The formulation includes sorbitol. The concentration of sorbitol (4.1% w/v) was selected to afford an 
isotonic finished product. This is an excipient with known effect covered by the Excipients Guideline 
and included in the ‘Annex to the European Commission guideline on ‘Excipients in the labelling and 
Assessment report

package leaflet of medicinal products for human use’ (SANTE-2017-11668)’ 
(EMA/CHMP/302620/2017). This is adequately addressed in the SmPC. 
Detailed information on formulation development has been presented.  
An evaluation of formulations through comparison and analyses of results across studies demonstrated 
that there were no meaningful differences of the overall absorption and disposition profile of 
pegcetacoplan between the final formulation and earlier formulations. 
Information on the development of the manufacturing process for the finished product has been 
presented.  
A non-ionic tonicity agent (sorbitol) was selected for the formulation. 
Pegcetacoplan is an inhibitor of the complement protein C3, and the mode of action is described in 
detail in relevant sections of the dossier. A biologically relevant ELISA-based assay was developed 
to evaluate pegcetacoplan biopotency. Bioassay data shows that the biological activity of the 
finished product remains stable during manufacturing and long-term storage. 
The intended commercial manufacturing process, product compatibility with manufacturing 
components, manufacturing process characterisation, justification for critical/non-critical process 
parameters and in-process controls, risk assessment of the finished product manufacturing process 
and intended control strategy for the manufacturing process are described. 
The primary packaging is a type I glass vial with a stopper (cholorobutyl), and a seal (aluminium) with 
a flip-off cap (polypropylene). The material complies with Ph. Eur. 3.2.1 (glass vials) and Ph. Eur. 3.2.9 
(rubber stoppers) requirements. 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of four main steps: 1. Compounding, 2. initial buffer preparation, 
3. addition of the active substance, 4. buffer preparation/addition/mixing, pre-filtration, sterile 
filtration, aseptic filling and stoppering. The process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing 
process due to the use of aseptic techniques (sterile filtration). 
The manufacturing process has been adequately described. Adequate justification for holding times has 
been provided.  
The chosen sterilisation method is acceptable.  
During the procedure, a major objection was raised in relation to the lack of full production scale 
validation data for the actual sterilisation process. In response. satisfactory data from 3 production 
scale batches was provided demonstrating the validation of the process steps.  
It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product 
of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls and critical process parameters are 
adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
appearance (visual, colour, Ph. Eur.), identity (RP-HPLC, SE-HPLC), assay (RP-HPLC), degradation 
products (RP-HPLC, SE-HPLC, SCX-HPLC), impurities (RP-HPLC), particulate matter (Ph. Eur.), 
container content for injection (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), osmolality (vapor pressure), bioassay (ELISA), 
bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and sterility (Ph. Eur.).

A justification was provided for each of the proposed specification limits for degradation products which 
are based on ICH Q6A requirements and batch analysis data as well as stability data. The control strategy 
for  specified degradation products  is  well  discussed.  The  proposed  limits  for  each  unspecified  finished 
product degradant are the same as in the active substance. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods have been 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Testing for elemental 
impurities in the finished product has been conducted in accordance with ICH Q3D (R1) Elemental 
Impurities for parenteral products. Thus, Class 1 and 2A elements were included and Class 2B testing 
was omitted since none were used in the manufacturing process. In addition, the three Class 3 
elements with the lowest permissible exposure limits were included (i.e., Cu, Sb, and Li). Based on the 
risk assessment and the presented batch data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include 
any elemental impurity controls in the finished product specification. 
During  the  procedure,  a  major  objection  was  raised  in  relation  to  the  requirement  to  provide  a  risk 
evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product. In response, the 
risk evaluation was performed considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions 
and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004  referral  on  nitrosamine  impurities  in  human  medicinal  products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004-  Nitrosamine  impurities  in  human  medicinal  products”  (EMA/369136/2020).  Based  on  the 
information provided it is accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine 
impurities  in  the  active  substance  or  the  related  finished  product.  Therefore,  no  additional  control 
measures are deemed necessary. 
Batch  analysis  results  are  provided  for  3  production  scale  batches  of  the  finished  product.  Additional 
batch  analysis  results  were  also  provided  for  pegcetacoplan  finished  product  batches  used  in  clinical 
studies  and  in  registration  stability  studies.  The  results  provided  confirm  the  consistency  of  the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
Stability data from three pilot-scale batches of finished product stored for up to 18 months under long 
term  conditions  (5°C  ±  3°C)  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  (25°C  /  60%  RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are representative to 
those proposed for marketing, manufactured using the intended commercial process and formulation, 
and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. The stability studies were performed 
for vials stored in both upright and inverted orientation. The active substance lots used to manufacture 
the  finished  product  registration  stability  batches  were  manufactured  at  commercial  scale  by  the 
commercial  manufacturer.  The  activated  PEG  intermediate  used  to  produce  those  active  substance 
batches was manufactured at pilot scale by the site of manufacture for this intermediate used during 
development.  Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  identity,  assay,  degradation  products,  impurities, 
bioassay, particulate matter, pH, container closure integrity and sterility. The analytical procedures used 
are stability indicating.  
Three months of long-term and 6 months accelerated stability data were also provided for an additional 
production-scale  finished  product  batch  using  the  intended  commercial  process  and  formulation.  The 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/629737/2021  
Page 19/150 
 
 
 
active substance lots used to produce the supportive finished product stability batch were manufactured 
using PEG intermediate from the intended commercial manufacturer.  
Under long-term storage conditions, the product remained stable and tested parameters remained within 
specification.  Under  accelerated  storage  conditions,  significant  changes  were  observed.  No  noticeable 
differences  in  stability  results  of  the  finished  product  in  upright  and  inverted position  were  observed. 
This confirms the suitability of the proposed primary packaging concept. 
Forced degradation studies were conducted and the finished product was exposed to thermal, UV-A and 
visible light, acidic, basic and oxidative aqueous stress conditions and the results showed that the finished 
product is susceptible to degradation upon exposure to heat, base, peroxide, UV, and visible light stress 
conditions. 
The  photostability  of  the  finished  product  was  evaluated  by  exposing  finished  product  stored  in  the 
immediate pack (consisting of a vial and stopper) and in the secondary pack (consisting of a carton) and 
control samples to light conditions that meet or exceed the conditions for confirmatory studies specified 
in ICH Q1B, Option 2. The finished product in immediate pack shows sensitivity to visible and UV light 
degradation while the secondary packaging provides adequate protection from light. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 18 months and the special precautions for 
storage “store in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C) and store in the original carton to protect from light” as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The active substance is a symmetric polypeptide covalently 
linked to polyethylene glycol and is manufactured via solid-phase peptide synthesis. The results of 
tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and 
these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform 
performance in clinical use. During the procedure major objections were raised in relation to the 
finished product regarding the lack of commercial scale process validation data and the absence of a 
nitrosamine risk evaluation. On both questions, satisfactory responses were received to resolve the 
major objections. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.4.6.  Recommendations for future quality development

2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Pegcetacoplan is constituted of two amino acid cyclic peptides conjugated to a linear polyethylene 
glycol (PEG) chain. The peptidic domains of the molecule are a derivative of Compostatin (a cyclic 
tridecapeptide with a highly potent and selective C3 inhibitory activity) and have been shown to bind 
C3 and C3b, resulting in inhibition of complement activation. The inhibition of C3 and C3b will have 
consequences on all complement system function such as opsonisation and inflammation principally. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
From the in vitro pharmacology studies, Pegcetacoplan was shown a binding to C3 and C3b with 
affinity of 15nM and 21,3 nM respectively. The EC50 of APL1 (non-pegylated peptide sequence) and 
pegcetacoplan seem to be similar (EC50 APL1 = 0.1648 µM and EC50 Pegcetacoplan = 0.05695 µM). 
The inhibitory activity of Pegcetacoplan is comparable to the non-pegylated peptide sequence 
demonstrating that the binding activity is little related to pegylated.  
Pegcetacoplan inhibited classical and alternative activation pathways but in different manner according 
to species: the inhibition is significant in the serum of humans and Cynomolgus monkeys but there is 
no inhibition in serum of rabbit or rat. The animal model Cynomolgus Monkeys is then considered as 
relevant.   
From the in vivo pharmacology studies, the highest dose of pegcetacoplan was obtained 8 hours after 
the day 2 and the concentration slowly declined through day 15 (end of study). To evaluate the 
efficacy of pegcetacoplan, the inhibition of complement system and the haemolysis activity have been 
measured by AH50 and CH50. AH50 and CH50 assays are traditional assays based on their lysis of 
antibody-coated sheep red blood cells (CH50) or rabbit red blood cells (AH50) due to activation of 
complement on the cell’s surface. The CH50 and AH50 (50% complement Haemolytic dose Alternative 
Complement haemolytic dose) were determinate by adding a limiting amount of the test serum or 
plasma. This functional assay measured the amount of hemoglobin that was released when the target 
cells were lysed by the action of complement, and from this, the percentage of the cells that had been 
lysed was calculated (Ricklin, 2017).  
At dose of 84mg/kg twice daily during 60min as intravenous injection at day 1 and day 2, 
Pegcetacoplan inhibited rapidly AH50 and CH50 hemolytic activity. Furthermore, the C3a and C3 levels 
decreased during the first 48hours (correlated with pegcetacoplan injection) and decreases of AH50 
and C3a levels were also correlated with pegcetacoplan concentration. The inhibition of both classical 
and alternative pathways was observed in Monkeys but from the fifth day, the CH50, AH50 and C3 
levels returned towards baseline. The effects on hemolysis activity, induced by the inhibition on 
complement, correlated with the pegcetacoplan concentration. Additionally, the Applicant discussed the 
scopes of pharmacological studies 18XTPH-001 and 19CFPH-001 more thoroughly as both C3 and C5 
inhibitors target complement system. 
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The  secondary  or  off  target  pharmacology  has  not  been  specifically  investigated  considering  that  the 
peptidic  domains  of  the  molecule  are  a  derivative  of  Compstatin  and  the  PEG  moiety  is  known  to  be 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/629737/2021  
Page 21/150 
 
 
 
biologically inert. However, even if the PEG part of pegcetacoplan is biologically inert, the active part is 
unknown  and  the  information  provided  about  Compstatin  is  insufficient  to  evaluate  the  secondary 
pharmacology  of  pegcetacoplan.  Therefore,  the  Applicant  provided  data  on  the  potential  off-target 
pharmacology by comparing peptide sequences of pegcetacoplan and 460 million sequences to identify 
sequence similarities with existing proteins or peptides that could indicate a risk of cross-reactivity or 
biological  interactions.  The  data  revealed  no  similarity  in  proteins  or  peptide  sequences,  natural  or 
artificial,  in  humans  or  otherwise,  supporting  a  low  probability  for  cross-reactivity  of  pegcetacoplan 
against natural receptors or ligands. 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
Several cardiac and respiratory endpoints in the toxicological studies were evaluated for safety 
pharmacology. Up to 300µM, there was little to no reduction in hERG current amplitude without or with 
Human Serum Albumin. The in vivo cardiac and respiratory potentials were evaluated from the 
toxicological study in Cynomolgus Monkeys (13CATX-005) after Single SC administration of 
pegcetacoplan (up to 140mg/kg) or PEG 40 (at 112mg/kg). No effects on body temperature, 
hemodynamics, electrocardiographic or respiratory parameters were observed. According to ICH M3 
guidelines, several endpoints such as the tidal volume, respiratory rate or hemoglobin oxygen 
saturation should be measured from the toxicological studies. In study 13CATX-005, the respiratory 
volume and the tidal volume were assessed.  
Pegcetacoplan distribution in brain was quantified in primates (Study 17MTX00001) with value below 
the limit of quantification. Moreover, pegcetacoplan does not cross the blood brain barrier and clinical 
observation did not suggest any behaviour trouble related to impairment of CNS. 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interactions study has been conducted to date. Data obtained from 
pharmacokinetic study did not suggest major interaction between cytochrome P450 enzyme or drug 
transporter and pegcetacoplan. 
It should be noted that pegcetacoplan will be co-administrated with eculizumab to avoid the risk of 
hemolysis. The AH50 values of subjects from Studies CP0514 and APL2-302 increased toward normal, 
reflecting persistent, partial, inhibition of the alternative pathway of complement pathway with 
repeated SC dosing of pegcetacoplan. The interaction between pegcetacoplan and eculizumab was 
evaluated as part of the PopPK analysis when co-administered to PNH subjects (studies APL2-302 and 
CP0514). It is expected that pharmacodynamic interactions between C3 and C5 inhibitors are very 
unlikely since both inhibit different parts of the complement cascade. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The LC-MS/MS assays for the measurement of pegcetacoplan have been validated adequately in rabbit 
and monkeys studies. The computer software to determine the TK parameters has been validated 
adequately. The LLOQ determined for each analysis methods is acceptable. According to Guideline on 
bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 2**), the information 
related to analytical methods is acceptable.

Pharmacokinetic in vivo analysis of pegcetacoplan in Cynomolgus Monkeys following a single 
intravenous or single or repeated dose subcutaneous administrations showed systemic exposure for all 
animals.  
From 13APK-001 study, after a single IV or SC dose of 7mg/kg, the Cmax was achieved 212 µg/ml 
after 5 minutes post dose (tmax) and 105 µg/ml after 3 days post dose , followed by a gradual decline 
to the final timepoint on Day 15. The T1/2 was of 7.8 and 7 ,5 days respectively. The bioavailability SC 
was estimated to be superior to 85%. In comparison IV and SC, the mean AUC 0-last, the mean 
clearance and the mean Vz were similar: 1174 and 1011 µg.day/mL, 4.31 and 4.80 mL/day/kg, and 
48.5 and 52.1 mL/kg respectively. After 7 consecutive daily dose at 7 mg/kg, the pharmacokinetic 
parameters are superior compare to single SC dose. The median Tmax was 7days, the Cmax and AUC 
0-last were 558 mg/ml and 5275 µg.day/mL (5-fold to Mean cmax and AUC in single dose study). Also, 
the mean T1/2 was longer with 8.66days than IV route. However, the clearance and the Vz were 
similar to single dose study with mean clearance of 4.5mL/d/kg and a mean Vz of 50 mL/kg.  
The 16CATX-003 study in 6 Cynomolgus monkeys females (n=3/group) compared two formulations: 
dextrose 5% and 0,9%NaCl + 10mM Sodium acetate trihydrate, pH 5.0. They received two 
consecutive daily 84 mg/kg pegcetacoplan doses administered as a 60-minute IV infusion. 
Pegcetacoplan was rapidly absorbed in 1.38 days (Median Tmax), with peak serum pegcetacoplan 
concentrations of 1805µg/mL for 5% dextrose and 1680µg/ml for 10mM acetate-buffered saline, pH 5, 
with an apparent t1/2 of approximately 6.68 days for both formulations. The mean AUC 0-last was 
9779 and 9774 µg/day/mL respectively. There is no major difference between two formulations at 
84mg/kg.  
The 19CAPK-001 study in Cynomolgus monkeys male compared 3 different weights of pegcetacoplan 
formulated in Dextrose 5%: 40.3, 45.3 and 47.8 kDa after SC injection single dose of 7mg/kg. The 
renal clearance is mainly correlated to molecular weight and the modification pharmacokinetic 
parameters should be expected. The results showed no significant difference between the 3 groups: 
the Tmax ranged from 2.67 to 3.67 days, the mean Cmax ranged from 93.8 to 99.2 µg/mL, the AUC 
0-last ranged from 963 to 1038 µg.day/mL, the mean T1/2 ranged from 7.71 to 9.71 days.  
The studies 13APK-001 (Monkey female) and 19CAPK-001 (Monkey male) were comparable and 
showed no significant difference between all pharmacokinetic parameters and similarity between 
different lots of comparable molecular weights used.  
Distribution 
A single dose radiolabelled study in males Monkeys was conducted to evaluate the distribution of 
pegcetacoplan in different tissues. Radiolabeled pegcetacoplan was widely absorbed after SC 
administration. The peak concentration was reached at 48 hours and the concentrations were 
measured at different time points: 8, 72, 168, 336 and 504h. For the majority of tissues analyzed, the 
Cmax was obtained after 72hours (for 19 tissues of 37). With a LLOQ of approximately 153ng.equiv/g, 
no distribution was observed or below the limit of quantification in the brain (including cerebellum, 
cerebrum, medulla, and spinal cord), gastrointestinal contents and optic nerve. It should be noted that 
distribution in eye was observed at 8 hours but decreased after 108h (4.5 days). One subject had a 
mild visual impairment/intermittent visual disturbance treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) 
during the run-in phase. This adverse event was considered mild and assessed by the investigator as 
possibly related to pegcetacoplan. From non clinical point of view, the distribution in eyes is decreasing 
and at 8 hours the value wad 1/240the the value measured in plasma. Moreover, no pegcetacoplan-
related ocular effects occurred during the toxicity study, and there were no microscopic findings in the 
eye at termination.

Target organs were blood, lung, spleen, liver, kidney and SC dose site. At the end of the study, 
radioactivity was still quantifiable in 19 tissues against 25 tissues at the beginning. At all timepoints, 
the radioactivity in blood was higher than in all tissues measured.  Regarding excretion, the mean 
urinary recovery of radioactive dose through 504 hours (3 weeks) post-dose was 44.55%.  
The distribution in Placenta was evaluated in pregnant female Cynomolgus monkeys, after a once daily 
SC administration of 28mg/kg/day of pegcetacoplan during the period of organogenesis through the 
second trimester of pregnancy (approximately 120 doses). Pegcetacoplan has been found in foetus and 
the mean concentration was 2.50µg/mL, representing a low level of placenta transfer (<1% of mean 
maternal concentration 1770 µg/mL) at the given dose. 
Metabolism 
Metabolism of Pegcetacoplan has not been specifically studied but it expected to be catabolized like 
PEGylated peptide/protein conjugates. In a study in monkeys, Pegcetacoplan was cleared slowly from 
the circulation (with mean serum concentration of 50 and 20% at 1 and 2 weeks after 2 consecutive 
days at 84mg/kg IV injection).  
Excretion 
The mean urinary recovery of radioactive dose through 3 weeks post dose was 44.55% in Monkey after 
dose of 7mg/kg SC.  The excretion in milk was evaluated in the monkey study, the pegcetacoplan 
concentration in milk samples decreased with time but remained quantifiable until Post-Partum day 14 
and 28 at doses of 7 and 28 mg/kg/day. On PPD 14, the concentration ranged from 29 to 287 ng/mL 
at 7 mg/kg/day and ranged from 42 to 272ng/ml at 25 mg/kg/day. The ratio concentration serum: 
milk on PPD14 demonstrate a low level of excretion in milk (<1%). Finally, pegcetacoplan has not been 
quantified in the offspring, demonstrating a minimal risk of exposure in case of breast finding or 
pregnancy. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interaction 
The drug drug interaction was evaluated in three in vitro metabolism assays, two studies assessing the 
inductor or inhibitor potential of pegcetacoplan and one study assessing if Pegcetacoplan serve as 
substrate and/or inhibitor for human drug transporters (Study 17COTX-002). Pegcetacoplan showed no 
apparent induction or inhibition of cytochrome P450 in human hepatocytes or liver microsomes at any 
concentrations tested (between 0.1 and 6mg/kg). These two studies suggest low potential to induce or 
inhibit the metabolism of drugs which are substrates of these cytochromes P450s. The assay 
evaluating human drug transporter interaction with pegcetacoplan as a substrate and/or inhibitor for 
key solute carrier (SLC) transporters and key ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters showed that 
pegcetacoplan was not a substrate nor an inhibitor of transporters at any concentrations tested 
(between 0.06 and 0.6 mg/kg).  
These studies demonstrate that pegcetacoplan has a low risk to interact with other drugs. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
No single-dose toxicity studies were conducted specifically with pegcetacoplan. The data used for 
single dose toxicity were obtained from the definitive 28-day studies in rabbit and monkeys at 
140mg/kg in SC injection, from the pharmacology study in monkeys at 84mg/kg in IV injection on day 
1 and 2, and from safety pharmacology in monkeys at 140mg/kg SC injection. These results showed a 
good tolerance of pegcetacoplan in different species (monkeys and rabbits) up to 140mg/kg in IV or 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/629737/2021  
Page 24/150 
 
 
 
SC injection and no adverse effect on cardiovascular or respiratory function were noted. Also, the 
genotoxic study 13BTX-003 in mice showed a good tolerance following two consecutive daily 
2000mg/kg IV doses. Pharmacological studies showed that pegcetacoplan was not pharmacologically 
active in non-primate species. The binding of pegcetacoplan on C3 is species-dependent. The peptidic 
domains to bind to human C3 is not conserved in non-primate species. The pharmacological activity in 
primates was demonstrated in in vitro and in vivo assays. However, to support the marketing 
authorization a second nonclinical toxicology species was considered necessary thus the rabbit was 
chosen because this species was presented tissue vacuolation associated with the PEG moiety and the 
renal tubular degeneration and it has been used also as a model to assess local irritancy and 
tolerability.  
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
The first pilot, non-GLP compliance studies were conducted in rabbits and monkeys during 7 days to 
determine the toxicological potential and the toxicokinetic of APL-2 (Pegcetacoplan) at 20mg/kg/day or 
PEG40 at 16mg/kg/day. After repeated injections each day, no clinical signs, injection signs reactions 
or changes in body weight or clinical pathology parameters were observed. Also, no macro or 
microscopic findings associated. Regarding toxicokinetic, serum pegcetacoplan concentration and T1/2 
increased each day with dose, suggesting an accumulation of product. In Rabbit, no sex difference was 
observed and no production of ADA against pegcetacoplan or PEG 40 were observed in monkeys. 
During the 28-day GPL compliance definitive studies in rabbits and monkeys, pegcetacoplan was 
administered at 7, 28 and 140mg/kg/day and 2 control groups were added: group PEG40 at 112mg/kg 
and group diluent alone (Dextrose 5%). A period of recovery of 28 days (after injections of 140mg/kg) 
was performed after the 28-day study to evaluate the reversibility of effects. 
From the rabbit study, some microscopic findings were observed in all groups, such as infiltrates of 
macrophages (histiocytes) or resident macrophages with abundant vacuolated cytoplasm and 
vacuolation of epithelial cells in the choroid plexus, kidney and synovium. The issue of the vacuoles in 
the choroid plexus of the brain has already been raised and discussed, especially for paediatric 
population (see CHMP Safety Working Party’s response to the PDCO regarding the use of PEGylated 
drug products in the paediatric population: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/chmp-safety-working-
partys-response-paediatric-committee-regarding-use-pegylated-drug-products). 
At 28mg/kg, hematologic effects were observed: increase of red cells and reticulocytes counts and a 
decrease of platelet and leucocytes counts and serum glucose and potassium concentrations. Only 
reticulocytes count return to or towards diluent control values after 28 day dose free recovery period. 
Concerning the reversibility of leucocyte count, a contradiction has been noted: In the summary 
document, the hematologic effects (cited above) have been not considered reversible (except the 
reticulocytes), but in the study report 13CATX-003 (p.29) the white blood cell count (leucocyte) return 
to the diluent control levels following a 28 day dose free recovery period. Concerning this discrepancy, 
the applicant amended the summary document with the correct fact: the reticulocyte and leucocytes 
counts returned to or toward diluent control values after 28-day dose free recovery period. Also, some 
effects on spleen and on injection sites have been observed: an increase number of vacuolated 
macrophages in red pulp in spleen and at 140 mg/kg an increase of severity inflammatory cell 
infiltrates. These effects were more important at 140mg/kg and persisted through the 28 days of 
recovery. It should be noted that the reversibility is known only for the group receiving 140mg/kg, and 
not for the group receiving 28mg/kg as mentioned by the Applicant.  
The microscopic findings, such as infiltrates of macrophages and vacuolation of epithelial cells, were 
also observed in PEG40 group, indicating the imputability of PEG40. A slight increase in incidence 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/629737/2021  
Page 25/150 
 
 
 
and/or severity at 140mg/kg suggests an additional effect of pegcetacoplan. Also, at 140mg/kg a 
minimal kidney degeneration was observed in one female after terminal sacrifice and on male after 
recovery period. Consequently, the NOAEL was considered to be 28mg/kg.  
From the monkeys study (13CATX-0004), at 28mg/kg/day, microscopic vacuolation and minimal 
degeneration in kidney were observed and not considered as reversible, but as previously mentioned, 
the reversibility is not determined at 28mg/kg. No explanation has been provided concerning the 
reversibility of the tubular degeneration in kidney in Rabbits and Monkeys, nor the subsequent clinical 
relevance. At 140mg/kg, changes on coagulation parameters such as a decrease of 42% of fibrinogen 
was observed, but this finding was reversible after 28 day recovery. At 140mg/kg and also in PEG40 
group (but less severe), the non-reversible effects after recovery period, were subcutaneous 
inflammatory cells infiltrates at the injection’s sites. As in the rabbit group, microscopic findings 
(infiltrates of macrophages, epithelial vacuolation) were observed in control group PEG40, and can be 
attributed to the PEG40. The NOAEL was considered to be 7mg/kg. The on and off targets effects was 
described in the dossier. The main effects were off target effect (related to PEG) and they were 
observed in rabbit and monkeys, excepted hematological toxicities but this change is not totally 
understood. 
In the study 14CATX-004, the applicant compared a Pegcetacoplan produced by a different 
manufacturer in monkeys. At the dose of 28mg/kg and PEG40 at 25.6mg/kg, the effects observed 
were minimal to mild epithelial vacuolation in the choroid plexus, microscopic findings in the kidney. 
These results showed that the pegcetacoplan manufactured by that manufacturer is comparable to 
those with pegcetacoplan at 28mg/kg/day in the previous 28-day definitive study. 
Another study (19CATX-003) was conducted in monkeys to qualify toxicologically some components 
that form in pegcetacoplan after accelerated degradation at 40°C for 7 days. Three 
monkeys/sex/groups received either heat- degraded pegcetacoplan (28 mg/kg/day), non-degraded 
pegcetacoplan (28 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (acetate-buffered 4.1% sorbitol) alone. Non degraded or 
heat depredated Pegcetacoplan were well tolerated. The effects observed (minimal tubular degradation 
in the kidney and microscopic findings at the injections sites) were similar with the previous 28-day 
study. The vehicle tested in group 3 is different from the vehicle used in toxicological study. The 
applicant provided an explanation concerning the different formulations used during the Pegcetacoplan 
development.   
In the 6 months study in rabbit, the doses tested were 1, 7 and 28 mg/kg and two additional groups 
were added with control PEG40 26mg/kg and diluent alone (5% dextrose). Of note, PEG40 was less 
concentrate in 6 and 9 months study than 28-day study. In 28mg/kg and PEG40 groups, some 
changes in haematology parameters were observed (minimally reduced red blood cell counts, 
hematocrit and haemoglobin in female), but these effects were attributable to PEG40. Similarly, to 28-
day definitive study (13CATX 003), effects related to PEG40 are observed (infiltrates of macrophage, 
epithelial vacuolation). The severity and incidence were comparable between 28 mg/kg group and 
PEG40 group. These changes were also observed at 1 and 7 mg/kg with a severity and incidence dose 
dependent, reflective of increase levels of PEG40. Also, in the kidney, microscopic findings were 
observed (minimal tubular degeneration) at all doses of pegcetacoplan as well as in PEG40 group and 
diluent group. 
In general, during 9 months pegcetacoplan was well tolerated in Monkeys. However, in the 7 and 
28mg/kg groups, hematologic parameters have been modified (reductions in mean red cells mass of 
10 and 15% respectively compared to baseline). In all groups treated by pegcetacoplan, some 
microscopic findings PEG-40 related such as infiltrates of macrophages, epithelial vacuolation and 
minimal tubular degeneration in kidney have been observed at 3 months (interim sacrifice) and 9 
months in the PEG40 groups. The NOAEL was 7mg/kg.  The vacuoles observed in non-clinical studies 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/629737/2021  
Page 26/150 
 
 
 
were not reversible even after a recovery period of 28-days. The Applicant elected not to include 
recovery groups on the chronic studies based on the not important severity of effects and the 
reversibility expected. The reversibility of vacuolation depends of the kind of PEG, the size and the 
mode and duration of administration. For pegcetacoplan, the only recovery study has shown that the 
effects were not reversible.  
Moreover, the description of degeneration/regeneration in the study report was not clear. Also, the 
microscopic studies of vacuole were present in order to confirm the non-severity of effect.    
Different routes of administration were compared in rabbits and monkeys: intravenous versus 
subcutaneous (future marketed form). For both species and for both routes of administration the 
effects have been similar. From 1mg/kg in SC and in IV, vacuolation in epithelial cell in kidney in 
rabbits and in mesenteric lymph in monkeys was observed in one male. 
The toxicokinetic parameters from all studies showed an increase of AUC 0-24h with repeat dose 
between day 1 and day 28 suggesting an accumulation of pegcetacoplan but from 6 and 9 months 
studies, a steady state was reached on day 28 (no difference in exposure on day 91, 180 and 273) 
suggesting a saturation. The mean AUC increase was dose proportional for 1 or 7 and 28mg/kg and 
from day 1 to day 28, but from day 28 and from 28mg/kg, the AUC increased in a generally less than 
dose proportional manner for the 20-fold increase for doses from 7 to 140 mg/kg/day, as exposure 
increased by approximately 12-fold on Day 1 and by approximately 4.7-fold on Day 28. There was no 
gender differences in pegcetacoplan exposure. In the rabbit 28-day study, Anti-Drug antibodies (ADA) 
were detected in all pegcetacoplan groups without any effects. In the 9 months Monkey study, ADA 
were confirmed in 5 samples at 1mg/kg/day on day 14, day 91 and day 273 while no ADA were 
detected in 28-day study. The animal exposure seems sufficient during the long studies (6 and 9 
months), especially since the administration was daily while it will be bi-weekly in human. 
This interspecies comparison focussed on PEG concentration. PEG exposure was dose proportional to 
pegcetacoplan dose. At the highest dose, animals were 30 times more exposed than humans. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
The genotoxic GLP-compliance studies were conducted on separate bacterial mutation (Ames) on 
several lots, on in vitro mammalian cell with or without metabolic activation system S9 (micronucleus 
test) and on mice (Micronucleus test in vivo) by injection IV as two consecutive daily doses of up to 
2000mg/kg. Several strains of salmonella Typhirium and Escherichia coli strain were tested covering 
different possible effects. As expected with peptide, the results for all tests were negative. In 
conclusion the potential genotoxic of pegcetacoplan is negative, based on these results. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
Rodent carcinogenicity bioassays on pegcetacoplan have not been conducted. Since pegcetacoplan is 
pharmacologically active only in humans and non-human primates, such studies would not add 
scientific value. The uniformly negative results of the genotoxicity assays indicate that pegcetacoplan is 
not mutagenic or clastogenic. There is no evidence from the toxicity studies that pegcetacoplan is 
either an endocrine disrupter, cell-cycle disregulator or a pro-inflammatory agent. Regarding the 
pharmacologic action of pegcetacoplan, whereas it has traditionally been viewed that complete-cascade 
inhibition may potentially be tumor-promotional through decreased immunosurveillance, the weight of 
more recent evidence suggests the converse to be true, i.e. that complement activation enhances 
tumor growth and increases tumor metastasis (Afshar-Kharghan, 2017). Indeed, complement 
inhibition has been postulated as a potential oncology therapy (Zhang et al., 2019).

2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Pegcetacoplan was demonstrated to be pharmacologically active in Cynomolgus monkeys but did not 
elicit a pharmacological response in rats and rabbits (study 19CFPH-001). Therefore, the reason for 
conducting embryo-foetal development studies (even no pivotal) in non-pharmacologically-relevant rat 
and rabbit species is unclear, and also questionable from a 3R’s perspective. In that case, a single 
enhanced pre- and post-natal development (ePPND) study is acceptable. 
The potential for effects on fertility could be assessed by evaluation of reproductive tract in repeat-
dose toxicity studies of at least 3 months duration using sexually mature monkeys at study initiation. 
The latter criterion was likely not fulfilled in study 15CATX-004 since monkeys were 2-4 years old at 
treatment initiation. The applicant acknowledges the concern and reports some difficulties to obtain 
monkeys aged 4-5 years which would be fully mature; the oldest available monkeys were used at the 
time of the study conduct. In this context, a detailed evaluation of the state of sexual maturity of 
Cynomolgus monkeys used in the pivotal 9-month toxicity study was performed. In males, 2-3 animals 
per group were found to be in the early adult/ adult age at the time of terminal examination based on 
testis weight and histopathology. In females, it is relied on publications defining the age of sexual 
maturity in monkeys according to the age of first menarche: 24-30 months (Buse et al 2008) or 1195 
days (~40 months: Kobayashi et al, 2018), keeping in mind that full maturity is not reached at this 
age. All animals were older than 24 months of age at initiation of treatment, and 2-4 animals per 
group reached the first menarche criterion of 1195 days at least 30 days before the end of the dosing 
period. Sexual development would have been active for the majority of these monkeys during the 
latter part of the study. In addition, there is no indication in the published literature for a potential 
adverse effect on fertility driven by the pharmacological activity of pegcetacoplan.  
No treatment-related effect was observed in (non GLP-compliant) embryo-foetal development studies 
conducted in rats and rabbits. The clinical relevance of these results is unclear since they were 
obtained in pharmacologically irrelevant species. In addition, the design of these studies was limited 
due to their nonpivotal nature (e.g. low number of litters, no visceral/skeletal foetal examinations…).  
In a pilot study conducted in Cynomolgus monkeys, no adverse developmental treatment-related 
outcome was observed following treatment from GD20 to GD140 at the dose of 28 mg/kg/day (x2.6-
fold patient exposure at the MHRD based on either Cmax or AUC). Epithelial and macrophage 
vacuolation was reported in the choroid plexus of the brain of treated females, but such findings were 
not observed in foetal brains. Toxicokinetic data suggest limited foetal exposure to pegcetacoplan since 
concentrations measured in the umbilicus were 0.15% those measured in maternal serum. 
Increased incidence of abortions and stillbirth resulting in an increase in total combined foetal loss 
(above historical control range) were observed in the high dose group treated at 28 mg/kg/day. There 
was no observed treatment-related teratogenic effect, and no effect on the development at 7 
mg/kg/day and in the remaining offspring at 28 mg/kg/day. 
Animal-to-human exposure ratios reached 1.3 at the NOAEL of 7 mg/kg/day, and 2.9 at the dose of 28 
mg/kg/day. These figures were calculated based on GD111 data. Data reported at GD140 were 
extrapolated from only one time-point (8 hours post-dose), and the TK data obtained in the pilot 
embryofoetal study showing comparable exposure levels in dams on GD111 and GD140 (at 28 
mg/kg/day). The pilot study suggested low foetal exposure to pegcetacoplan based on a low foetal 
umbilicus/maternal serum ratio (0.15%). In the ePPND study, a time-related decrease in systemic 
exposure was reported in maternal animals with quantifiable levels up to PND14 (7 mg/kg/day) or 28 
(28 mg/kg/day). Serum concentrations could not be quantified in infants from day 14 of age, with also 
low milk/serum ratios at this occasion (no greater than 0.52%).

Excessive activation or inadequate regulation of the complement system lead to placental dysfunction. 
Regal et al (2015) report that complement regulation is apparent at the placental interface from early 
pregnancy with some degree of complement activation occurring normally throughout gestation. In the 
present study, no treatment-related effect was reported at examination of (available) placentae. The 
applicant also relies on this publication to indicate that the increase in abortions and stillbirths seen in 
the ePPND study was not expected because regulation of the complement cascade is beneficial to 
pregnancy maintenance. Although it cannot be excluded that the pharmacological regulation of the 
complement system may trigger different effects in healthy vs. diseased pregnant animals, there is 
currently no sufficient rationale to consider that the adverse foetal outcome in the ePPND study are not 
clinically relevant. 
Toxicology studies in juvenile animals have not been conducted. In the pivotal 9-month repeat-dose 
toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkeys, animals ranged from approximately 2 years (i.e., adolescent) 
to approximately 4 years (i.e., young adult) of age at the time of study initiation, thus, providing a 
representative view of potential effects of pegcetacoplan on postnatal growth and development in the 
intended paediatric population. As the agreed paediatric investigation plan for pegcetacoplan in the 
treatment of PNH (P/0149/2020) includes adolescents between the ages of 12 and <18, but not 
younger children or infants, data from the existing nonclinical study package is considered to 
sufficiently capture potential adverse effects on organ systems undergoing postnatal development 
during this range of time.  
2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
2.5.4.7.  Local Tolerance  
No specific study for local tolerance has been conducted. The local tolerance has been assessed 
according to the effects observed in repeated dose studies. No injection-site reactions were noted but a 
slight increase of inflammatory cells or an accumulation of vacuolated macrophages was observed at 
doses ≥28 mg/kg/day in rabbits and monkeys. The presence of vacuolated macrophages is expected 
and known with repeated injections of PEG40.

2.5.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
No specific antigenicity study has been conducted. The results obtained from toxicological studies and 
toxicokinetic showed a low antigenicity at titers of 1:20 to 1:500 and pegcetacoplan is less antigenic 
when the administration is performed by IV route (titers of 1:20 to 1:100). As the efficacy is not 
impacted, the ADA do not seem neutralizing. ADA are directed against PEG40 and are dependent on 
PEG ramification. 
Immunotoxicity 
No specific immunotoxicity study has been conducted. In this case, the non-clinical study conducted in 
rabbits showed some modifications of hematology parameters such as a decrease of leucocytes count, 
and a production of antibodies (ADA) against Peg40 in rabbit and more weakly in monkeys. As the 
efficacy is not impacted, the ADA do not seem neutralizing and appear late. ADA are directed against 
PEG40 and are dependent on PEG ramification. However, no increased incidence of infections has been 
noted in rabbit or monkeys. In monkeys no changes in clinical pathology parameters (serum protein 
concentration or total protein or leucocytes count) has been observed while a decrease of leucocytes 
count has been observed in rabbit. Pegcetacoplan is weakly to moderately antigenic to rabbits and 
minimally to monkeys by the ADA production.  
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Persistance  Bioaccumulation  and  Toxicity  screening  resulted  in  logKow  values  lower  than  4.5,  so 
pegcetacoplan is hydrophile and no bioaccumulable in the environment. Even if based on the results of 
biodegradability  test,  pegcetacoplan  cannot  be  characterised  as  readily  biodegradable  and  that  a  test 
protocol  OECD  308  on 
sediment 
system 
should  be 
required 
(in  accordance  with 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00  guideline  (EMEA,  2006)  and  the  Questions  and  Answers  on  the  Guideline 
CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 (EMA, 2011a)), the environmental release of PEG from pegcetacoplan will be 
negligible  in  comparison  to  the  release  from  other  consumer  products  (cosmetics  and  body  care 
products). Furthermore, a full ECHA registration dossier is available for PEG 1. This latter demonstrates 
that additional degradability testing for the PEG-moiety in pegcetacoplan is unnecessary and therefore 
not warranted.  
PECsurface  water  calculated  is  3.021  ng/L,  which  is  below  the  action  limit.  A  Phase  II  assessment  is 
deemed not necessary. Usually the Fpen used is 1%, in this case, the applicant chose to evaluate the 
PECWS with a lower Fpen of 0.00159% in view of the rarity of the PNH. Although the reliability of data 
is weak, it is considered very unlikely that the Fpen reaches values that could increase the PEC above 
the ERA action limit. Thus, the Fpen used to evaluate the PECws is acceptable.   
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical development program for pegcetacoplan was designed in accordance with ICH M3 
guidelines.  
The pharmacological profile of pegcetacoplan was demonstrated in in vitro assays and in vivo in 
Cynomolgus monkey. Pegcetacoplan inhibits the alternative and classical pathways of complement 
system by binding to C3 and C3b with affinity of 15nM and 21,3 nM respectively. The secondary or off 
target pharmacology has not been specifically investigated considering that the peptidic domains of the 
molecule are a derivative of Compstatin and the PEG moiety is known to be biologically inert. However,

these justifications were not considered acceptable. The assays on canal hERG to assess cardiac 
function was conducted specifically. Up to 300µM, there was little to no reduction in hERG current 
amplitude without or with Human Serum Albumin. Several endpoints such as cardiac and respiratory 
functions from the toxicological studies were evaluated for safety pharmacology. According to ICH M3 
guidelines, several endpoints such as the tidal volume, respiratory rate or hemoglobin oxygen 
saturation should be measured from the toxicological studies. In study 13CATX-005, the respiratory 
volume and the tidal volume were assessed. However, concerning the potential action on Central 
Nervous System, Pegcetacoplan distribution in brain was quantified in primates (Study 17MTX00001) 
with value below the limit of quantification. Moreover, pegcetacoplan does not cross the blood brain 
barrier and clinical observation did not suggest any behaviour trouble related to impairment of CNS.  
No pharmacodynamic drug interactions study has been conducted to date. Data obtained from the 
pharmacokinetic study did not suggest a major interaction between cytochrome P450 enzyme or drug 
transporter and pegcetacoplan. However, it should be noted that pegcetacoplan will be co-
administrated with eculizumab to avoid the risk of hemolysis. The AH50 values of subjects from 
Studies CP0514 and APL2-302 increased toward normal, reflecting a persistent, partial, inhibition of 
the alternative pathway of complement pathway with repeated SC dosing of pegcetacoplan. The 
interaction between pegcetacoplan and eculizumab, a C5 inhibitor, was evaluated as part of the PopPK 
analysis when co-administered to PNH subjects (studies APL2-302 and CP0514). It is expected that 
pharmacodynamic interactions between C3 and C5 inhibitors are very unlikely since both inhibit 
different parts of the complement cascade, thus the lack of pharmacodynamics drug interaction study 
is acceptable. 
According to the Guideline on bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009  Rev. 1 
Corr. 2**), the information related to analytical methods is acceptable. Absorption, distribution, 
metabolism and excretion of pegcetacoplan have been thoroughly evaluated following intravenous and 
subcutaneous administration (single and repeated) in Cynomolgus monkeys, species used for 
pharmacology and toxicology studies. No plasma protein binding studies were performed with 
pegcetacoplan which is acceptable. The distribution in Placenta was evaluated in pregnant female 
Cynomolgus monkeys and Pegcetacoplan has been found in foetus and the mean concentration was 
2.50µg/mL, representing a low level of placenta transfer (<1% of mean maternal concentration 1770 
µg/mL) at the given dose.  
The toxicological profile of pegcetacoplan has been evaluated during repeat-dose toxicity studies in 
Cynomolgus monkeys and rabbit. No Single-dose toxicity studies were conducted specifically with 
pegcetacoplan. The data used for single dose toxicity were obtained from the definitive 28-day studies 
in rabbit (Study 13CATX-003) and monkeys (Study 13CATX-004) at 140mg/kg in SC injection, from 
the pharmacology study 16CATX-0003 in monkeys at 84mg/kg in IV injection on day 1 and 2, and 
from safety pharmacology in monkeys (13CATX-0005) at 140mg/kg SC injection. These results shown 
a good tolerance of pegcetacoplan in different species (monkeys and rabbits) up to 140mg/kg in IV or 
SC injection and no adverse effect on cardiovascular or respiratory function were noted. In 
pharmacological studies, it was shown that pegcetacoplan was pharmacologically active only in non 
human primate species. After 7 days of pegcetacoplan at 20mg/kg in rabbit and monkeys no macro or 
microscopic findings were observed.  
From the 28-day rabbit study (13CATX-0003), some microscopic findings were observed in all groups, 
such as infiltrates of macrophages (histiocytes) or resident macrophages with abundant vacuolated 
cytoplasm and vacuolation of epithelial cells in the choroid plexus, kidney and synovium. The problem 
of the vacuoles in the choroid plexus of the brain has already been raised and discussed, especially for 
paediatric population (CHMP Safety Working Party’s response to the PDCO regarding the use of 
PEGylated drug products in the paediatric population).

Hematologic effects were observed: increase of red cells and reticulocytes counts and a decrease of 
platelet and leucocytes counts and serum glucose and potassium concentrations. Only reticulocytes 
counts return to or towards diluent control values after 28 day dose free recovery period.  
From the monkeys’ study, at 28mg/kg/day, microscopic vacuolation and minimal degeneration in 
kidney were observed and not considered as reversible, but as previously mentioned, the reversibility 
is not determined at 28mg/kg. No explanation has been provided concerning the reversibility of the 
tubular degeneration in kidney in Rabbits and Monkeys, nor the subsequent clinical relevance.  
Another study (19CATX-003) was conducted in monkeys to qualify toxicologically some components 
that form in pegcetacoplan after accelerated degradation at 40°C for 7 days. The effects observed 
(minimal tubular degradation in the kidney and microscopic findings at the injections sites) were 
similar with the previous 28-day study. 
During the 6 months rabbit study, some changes in haematology parameters were observed 
(minimally reduced red blood cell counts, haematocrit and haemoglobin in female), but this effects 
were attributable to PEG40. In general, during the 9 months study in Monkeys, pegcetacoplan was well 
tolerated with some hematologic parameters’ changes. Concerning the lack of data on PEG vacuole 
reversibility of 6 and 9 months and the absence of reversibility, according to ICH M3 guideline, the 
applicant demonstrated that reversibility was not evident within 28 days of dosing cessation, and the 
literature suggested that prolonged durations may be needed to show reversibility complete or at least 
partial in some tissues or organs. Moreover, the immunochemistry data were not provided (not 
conducted). However, the vacuolation were described in literature (Rudmann et al, 2013) and 
comparable to pegcetacoplan. The clinical relevance is unknown and the reversibility was not evaluated 
from 6 and 9-months studies. This justification is acceptable with regards to the indication and the 
adult population. As regard the non-clinical data, section 5.3 of the SmPC states that “Repeat dose 
studies were conducted in rabbits and Cynomolgus monkeys with daily subcutaneous doses of 
pegcetacoplan up to 7 times the human dose (1 080 mg twice weekly). Histologic findings in both 
species included dose dependent epithelial vacuolation and infiltrates of vacuolated macrophages in 
multiple tissues. These findings have been associated with large cumulative doses of long chain PEG in 
other marketed PEGylated drugs, were without clinical consequence, and were not considered adverse. 
Reversibility was not demonstrated in the pegcetacoplan animal studies after one month and was not 
evaluated for a longer duration. Data from literature suggest reversibility of PEG vacuoles. Renal 
tubular degeneration was observed microscopically in both species at exposures (Cmax and AUC) less 
than or comparable to those for the human dose and was minimal and nonprogressive between 4 
weeks and 9 months of daily administration of pegcetacoplan. Although no overt signs of renal 
dysfunction were observed in animals, the clinical significance and functional consequence of these 
findings are unknown.  
The genotoxic GLP-compliance studies, were conducted on separate bacterial mutation (Ames) on 
several lots, on in vitro mammalian cell with or without metabolic activation system S9 (micronucleus 
test) and on mice (Micronucleus test in vivo) according to ICH M3 Guidelines. As expected with a 
peptide, the results for all tests were negative. In conclusion the potential genotoxic of pegcetacoplan 
is negative, based on these results.  
Rodent carcinogenicity bioassays on pegcetacoplan have not been conducted. Since pegcetacoplan is 
pharmacologically active only in humans and non-human primates, such studies would not add 
scientific value. The uniformly negative results of the genotoxicity assays indicate that pegcetacoplan is 
not mutagenic or clastogenic. This is considered acceptable.   
Reproductive and developmental toxicity

Pegcetacoplan was demonstrated to be pharmacologically active in Cynomolgus monkeys only. It did 
not elicit a pharmacological response in rats and rabbits, therefore, the reason for conducting embryo-
foetal development studies (even nonpivotal) in these species is unclear and debatable. Considering 
also the limitations of these studies due to their nonpivotal nature (e.g. low number of litters, no 
visceral/skeletal foetal examinations…), they were not considered for a human risk assessment. 
The following statement is provided in section 5.3 of the SmPC: “Pegcetacoplan treatment of pregnant 
cynomolgus monkeys at a subcutaneous dose of 28 mg/kg/day (2.9 times the human steady state 
Cmax) from the gestation period through parturition resulted in a statistically significant increase in 
abortions or stillbirths. No maternal toxicity or teratogenic effects were observed in offspring delivered 
at term. Additionally, no developmental effects were observed in infants up to 6 months postpartum. 
Systemic exposure to pegcetacoplan was detected in foetuses from monkeys treated with 28 
mg/kg/day from the period of organogenesis through the second trimester, but the exposure was 
minimal (less than 1%, not pharmacologically significant).” 
No fertility study was conducted with pegcetacoplan. The applicant relies on the repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in monkeys showing no adverse effects of pegcetacoplan in males or females sex organs. This 
strategy is in accordance with current recommendations for biopharmaceuticals demonstrated to be 
pharmacologically relevant only in non-human primates. However, only results of studies of at least 3 
months duration initiated in sexually mature animals should be considered in that case. This criterion 
was likely not fulfilled in the 9-month monkey study (no.15CATX-004) since animals were 2-4 years 
old at treatment initiation. The applicant acknowledges the concern and reports some difficulties to 
obtain monkeys aged 4-5 years which would be fully mature; the oldest available monkeys were used 
at the time of the study conduct. In this context, a detailed evaluation of the state of sexual maturity 
of Cynomolgus monkeys used in the pivotal 9-month toxicity study was performed. In males, 2-3 
animals per group were found to be in the early adult/ adult age at the time of terminal examination 
based on testis weight and histopathology. In females, it is relied on publications defining the age of 
sexual maturity in monkeys according to the age of first menarche: 24-30 months (Buse et al 2008) or 
1195 days (~40 months: Kobayashi et al, 2018), keeping in mind that full maturity is not reached at 
this age. All animals were older than 24 months of age at initiation of treatment, and 2-4 animals per 
group reached the first menarche criterion of 1195 days at least 30 days before the end of the dosing 
period. Overall, the applicant’s conclusion that sexual development would have been active for the 
majority of these monkeys during the latter part of the study is agreed. In addition, it is explained that 
there is no indication in the published literature for a potential adverse effect on fertility driven by the 
pharmacological activity of pegcetacoplan. Therefore, the following statement is provided in section 4.6 
of the SmPC/ Fertility “No animal or human data on the effect of pegcetacoplan on fertility are 
available. In toxicity studies, there were no microscopic abnormalities in male or female reproductive 
organs in monkeys (see section 5.3). Data from studies conducted in pharmacologically-irrelevant 
species (rabbit) have not be reflected in the SmPC. 
In an enhanced pre- and post-natal development toxicity study performed in monkeys, maternal 
animals were treated s.c. at 0, 7, and 28 mg/kg/day from GD20 to parturition, and then monitored 
with their offspring up to 6 months postnatal. At the top dose (x2.9-fold clinical exposure) increases in 
abortions and stillbirth resulting in an increase in total combined foetal loss (above historical control 
range) were observed. In infants, no treatment-related effect was reported at external, visceral, and 
skeletal examinations, morphometric measurements, neurobehavioral or neurological evaluations, 
TDAR assessments, gross pathology and histopathology (including brains), organ weights, or heart 
morphology evaluations. The maternal and developmental NOAEL was 7 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 
exposure levels at GD 111 similar (x1.3) to those reached in patients at the recommended dose. 
During the postnatal period, systemic exposure levels in maternal animals declined up to postnatal day 
14/28 whereas pegcetacoplan could not be quantified in infants from postnatal day 14 to 182. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/629737/2021

Pegcetacoplan was excreted in maternal milk, albeit minimally (milk/serum ratios on postnatal day 14 
of maximum 0.52%). In a pilot embryofoetal monkey toxicity study, the foetal umbilicus/maternal 
serum ratio of 0.15% measured at C-section on GD 140 also suggested low foetal exposure to 
pegcetacoplan. These results were reported adequately in section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
No specific study for local tolerance has been conducted. The local tolerance has been assessed 
according to the effects observed in repeated dose studies. No injection-site reactions were noted but a 
slight increase of inflammatory cells or an accumulation of vacuolated macrophages were observed at 
doses ≥28 mg/kg/day in rabbits and monkeys.  
No specific studies of antigenicity, immunotoxicity have been conducted. This is considered acceptable 
for this product.  
Persistance Bioaccumulation and Toxicity screening resulted in logKow values lower than 4.5, so 
pegcetacoplan is hydrophile and no bioaccumulable in the environment. Even if based on the results of 
biodegradability test, pegcetacoplan can not be characterised as readily biodegradable and that a test 
protocol OECD 308 on sediment system should be required (in accordance with 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 guideline (EMEA, 2006) and the Questions and Answers on the Guideline 
CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 (EMA, 2011a)), the environmental release of PEG from pegcetacoplan will be 
negligible in comparison to the release from other consumer products (cosmetics and body care 
products). Furthermore, a full ECHA registration dossier is available for PEG. This latter demonstrates 
that additional degradability testing for the PEG-moiety in pegcetacoplan is unnecessary and therefore 
not warranted. PECsurface water calculated is 3.021 ng/L, which is below the action limit. A Phase II 
assessment is deemed not necessary. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall,  the  non-clinical  package  available  for  pegcetacoplan  is  considered  sufficient  to  support  the 
marketing authorisation for the proposed indication. 
2.6.  Clinical aspects

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods 
Bioanalytical  methods  were  used  for  determining  serum  pegcetacoplan  concentration,  for  monitoring 
immunogenicity and for the measurement of pharmacodynamics parameters. 
Serum pegcetacoplan concentration 
Concentrations  of  pegcetacoplan  (APL2)  were  determined  in  human  serum  using  the  liquid 
chromatography  tandem  mass  spectrometry  (LC-MS/MS)  method.  Bioanalytical  methods  were 
satisfactorily  validated  in  accordance  with  the  EMA  Guideline  on  bioanalytical  method  validation 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009  Rev.  1).  LC-MS/MS  methods  were  developed  and  validated  at  three 
different laboratoriesand were used for bioanalysis of the samples across studies.  
Immunogenicity 
•  ADA assay 
In early clinical studies (CP0713, CP1014, 401, CP0514 and 6 subjects from Study 204), ELISA-based 
ADA assay  was used to detect antibodies against pegcetacoplan in human serum. In later clinical studies, 
a  standard  multi-tiered  approach  was  employed  including  screening,  confirmatory  and  titer  assays  to 
evaluate  anti-drug  antibodies  in  accordance  with  EMA  Guideline  on  Immunogenicity  assessment  of 
therapeutic proteins (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006 Rev 1). In those studies, ECL-based ADA assay 
was used to detect antibodies against peptide moiety of pegcetacoplan in parallel with ELISA-based ADA 
assay  to  detect  antibodies  against  PEG  moiety  of  the  drug  molecule.  Assays  were  developed  at  two 
different sites.  
•  Nab assay 
A  competitive  ligand  binding  ECL-assay  was  developed  to  detect  neutralising  anti-pegcetacoplan 
antibodies in human serum samples. The assay was applied in studies 101, 302 and 204.  
Pharmacodynamics markers 
Analytical methods were developed for three PD biomarkers measured in clinical studies: AH50/AP50, 
CH50 and C3, at several different laboratories. The methods are considered adequately validated for the 
purpose. 
Flow cytometry assessment was used in studies with PNH subjects (CP0514, 204, 202 and 302) for the 
characterization  of  PNH  associated  abnormal  red  blood  cells  or  characterization  of  PNH  associated 
abnormal white blood cells in peripheral whole blood, developed. The validation results for both assays 
met the acceptance criteria and the assays are considered appropriately validated for the purpose. 
PK data across the studies were analysed using non-compartmental and population PK analysis. 
Population PK analysis (APL-EX20-CP-002) 
Population PK analysis included pegcetacoplan serum concentration-time data from 10 studies. The final 
analysis dataset included a total of 239 unique subjects with a total of 4377 PK samples, including 3734 
quantifiable samples. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/629737/2021  
Page 36/150 
 
 
 
 
Approximately  half  of  subjects  in  the  dataset  were  adults  with  PNH  (48.1%)  and  half  were  healthy 
volunteers (51.9%). More than half of all subjects were male (56.5%), while 43.5% of subjects were 
female.  The  majority  of  subjects  (64.4%)  were  White  and  22.2%  of  subjects  were  Asian  (including 
Japanese ethnicity). For all subjects, the median age was 35 years (range: 19-81 years) and median 
baseline body weight was 71.2 kg (range: 42.3-156 kg). 
Pegcetacoplan  PK  following  SC  or  IV  administration  was  adequately  described  by  a  one-compartment 
disposition model with transit compartment absorption (n=1) for the SC route, direct administration of 
intravenous doses into the central compartment, and first order elimination. The base model included 
the following structural covariates: lyophilized formulation (FORM4) on subcutaneous bioavailability (F1), 
C3 level on CL and V2, and PNH patient status divided into Phase 1 or 2 (PNH2) and Phase 3 studies 
(PNH3) on CL. In the covariate model evaluation, after stepwise backward elimination procedure based 
on the likelihood ratio test, weight was found to be a significant covariate on CL/F and V/F.  
Parameters for the final model are summarized in Table 5. 
Table 3 Pharmacokinetic Parameter Estimates for the Final Model 
The  model  was  used  to  describe  PK  of  pegcetacoplan  and  to  assess  effect  of  the  covariates  on  the 
variability in PK parameters. Model based simulations were performed to assess the impact of covariates 
on  predicted  pegcetacoplan  exposure.  Stochastic  simulations  were  performed  to  predict  key  PK 
parameters  and  exposure  measures  for  healthy  adults  and  adult  PNH  patients.  Various  SC  dosing 
regimens  were  simulated  reflecting  those  used  in  patient  studies  during  the  clinical  development  of 
pegcetacoplan: 270 mg once daily, 360 mg once daily, 1080 mg twice weekly, and 1080 mg every three 
days.  
Absorption  
In studies CP0713-1 and CP1014, pegcetacoplan was administered as SC injections, while later (Study 
101) dose was delivered by SC infusion due to dose volume. The change of the mode of administration 
did not influence the disposition profile of pegcetacoplan. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/629737/2021  
Page 37/150 
 
 
 
 
 
PK  evaluation  in  healthy  subjects  showed  that  following  a  single  SC  dose  (Study  CP0713-1), 
pegcetacoplan is slowly absorbed with a median Tmax ranging from 108 to 144 hours (4.5 to 6 days).  
Following multiple dosing to healthy subjects in Study 101, median Tmax was observed between 576.1 
and 647.9 hours (24 to 27 days). 
Distribution 
No plasma protein binding study has been conducted because pegcetacoplan binds to complement C3 in 
systemic circulation. Both pegcetacoplan and C3 levels have been monitored in all clinical pharmacology 
studies. 
No specific studies of distribution to red blood cells have been performed. Considering the structure of 
pegcetacoplan  (2  identical  cyclic  peptides  linked  by  a  linear  40  kDa  PEG  moiety),  the  potential  for 
distribution in RBCs is considered to be low. 
The Vz/F values ranged from 3.6 to 6.1 L across studies (CP0713-1 and CP1014). In the Pop PK analysis, 
volume of the central compartment for a typical subject was estimated at 4.1 L (21.5%).  
Elimination 
Pegcetacoplan is composed of 2 identical pentadecapeptides covalently bound to the ends of a linear 40-
kDa  polyethylene  glycol  (PEG)  molecule.  Like  other  PEGylated  protein/peptide  conjugates,  catabolic 
pathways are expected to be mainly responsible for the metabolism of pegcetacoplan, which is expected 
to  be  degraded  into  smaller  peptide-PEG  conjugates,  peptides,  and  eventually  amino  acids  by 
endogenous proteases. Peptides are known to be metabolized by proteolytic degradation and eliminated 
by cellular uptake or renal filtration. PEG molecules >5 kDa typically undergo minimal metabolism and 
are renally excreted. 
CL/F, Vz/F and t1/2 in healthy subjects were consistent across the doses and across single and multiple 
dose studies. The CL/F values in healthy subjects ranged from 11.1 to 20.7 mL/h across studies (CP0713-
1 and CP1014). Median t1/2 values ranged from approximately 8 to 10 days (CP0713-1 and 101). 
In the Pop PK analysis, clearance for a typical subject was estimated at 12.4 mL/h (19.5%). 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Following single ascending doses of SC pegcetacoplan from 45 to 1440 mg in healthy subjects (CP0713-
1)  and  multiple  ascending  doses  from  30  to  270  mg  once  daily  during  28  days  (CP1014),  exposure 
metrics of AUC and Cmax increased in a generally proportional manner.  
Following multiple dosing for 28 days in healthy subjects (CP1014), pegcetacoplan did not show time-
dependent PK compared to single dose. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Study  205  evaluated  PK  of  a  single  270  mg  SC  dose  of  pegcetacoplan  in  subjects  with  severe  renal 
impairement compared to matched (sex, age and weight) healthy controls. Geometric means for Cmax 
(38.2  and  38.7  μg/mL,  respectively)  and  AUC0-∞  (18,153  and  20,078  μg·h/mL,  respectively)  were 
similar for subjects in the severe and control groups, as were mean values for CL/F, Vz/F, and t½. Study 
results  show  that  there  were  no  meaningful  differences  in  PK  parameters  between  control  group  and 
group with severe renal impairment. 
Additionally, the CrCL was tested as a continuous covariate in the developed PPK model. CrCL was not 
identified as a significant covariate.

Hepatic impairment 
No  specific  studies  have  been  conducted  in  study  participants  to  determine  the  effect  of  hepatic 
impairment  on  the  PK  of  pegcetacoplan.  Metabolism  of  the  peptide  moiety  of  the  drug  molecule  is 
expected to be driven by catabolism to amino acids. PEG moiety is typically renally excreted. 
Gender 
Based  on  the  results  of  the  pop  PK  analysis,  gender  did  not  have  clinically  relevant  effect  on  the 
pegcetacoplan PK. 
Race 
Study 102 was designed to bridge PK data from non-Japanese healthy volunteers and Japanese subjects. 
Results from non-Japanese subjects were obtained from SAD study (APL-CP0713-1) and were compared 
with the results from this part of the study where only Japanese subjects were enrolled.  
Results  from  the  two  studies  over  a  period  of  1008  hours  post-dose,  showed  similar  Cmax  in  both 
populations (range of 29% higher to 13% lower) across dose range. AUC0-inf geometric means were 
slightly higher with the Japanese subjects for all of the doses (11 to 36%). This result was supported by 
Ad–hoc  covariate  analysis  in  popPK  which  showed  that  covariate  ethnicity  was  not  found  to  have  a 
statistically significant effect on CL. 
Weight 
PopPK analysis showed that only body weight had an effect on CL and V. Both CL and V2 increased with 
increasing body weight leading to lower pegcetacoplan exposure with higher body weight; however, the 
impact on exposure was modest over the range of body weights in the simulation. 
Steady-state  pegcetacoplan  exposure,  based  on  average  (Cavg,ss)  and  maximal  (Cmax,ss) 
concentration, was predicted to be approximately 15% higher at the 5th percentile of body weight (54 
kg) and 15% lower at the 95th percentile of body weight (95 kg), compared to a reference weight of 70 
kg. Observed impact was found not to have clinically meaningful effect.  
Elderly 
Based on the results of the pop PK analysis, age did not have clinically relevant effect on pegcetacoplan 
PK and on model predicted Cavg,ss and Cmax,ss in PNH patients.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Only in vitro interaction studies were performed. 
Pegcetacoplan concentrations evaluated in the in vitro studies (up to 6 mg/mL) covered the expected in 
vivo exposure. At concentrations tested, pegcetacoplan was not a direct nor time-dependent inhibitor of 
CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5. Pegcetacoplan was not an inducer 
of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4/5.

At concentrations tested, pegcetacoplan was not a substrate or inhibitor of uptake transporters OAT1, 
OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, and was not a substrate or inhibitor of efflux transporters P-gp 
and BCRP. 
Population PK analysis evaluated the potential interaction between eculizumab and pegcetacoplan since 
these  two  agents  were  co-administered  to  PNH  subjects  in  Study  APL2-302  and  Study  CP0514. 
Eculizumab  co-administration  was  not  a  statistically  significant  covariate  on  pegcetacoplan  PK 
parameters. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The  peptide  moieties  of  pegcetacoplan  molecule  bind  to  complement  protein  C3  and  its  activation 
fragment C3b with high affinity, thereby regulating the cleavage of C3 and the generation of downstream 
effectors of complement activation. Pegcetacoplan exerts broad regulation of the complement cascade 
by acting proximal to both C3b and MAC formation, thereby controlling the mechanisms that lead to EVH 
and  IVH.  These  functions  of  Pegcetacoplan  underly  the  observed  sustained  reduction  in  complement 
mediated haemolytic activity in patients with PNH. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
Healthy patients 
The applicant conducted five studies (Study CP0713-1; Study 401; Study CP1014; Study 101; and Study 
102) in healthy subjects to evaluate the PD of pegcetacoplan. 
No effect on complement CH50 was observed with pegcetacoplan.  
Across Study 401 and Study 101, mean AH50 results markedly decreased in all active study drug groups 
after initiation of treatment. However, in healthy Japanese subjects in Study 102, no statistical significant 
effect on AH50 in comparison to placebo was observed with pegcetacoplan. A reduction of AP50 from 
baseline  level  was  observed  at  the  pegcetacoplan  1440  mg  dose  level  in  study  CP0713-1  and  at  the 
pegcetacoplan 180 and 270 mg dose levels in Study CP1014. 
Serum complement C3 increased with increasing does in all five studies.  
In Study 401, a statistically significant decrease of C3a was observed with pegcetacoplan administration 
and was not dose-related. However, no effect was observed on C3a with pegcetacoplan administration 
in Study 101 and Study 102.  
In Study CP1014, reduction of LDH compared to placebo was statistically significant and was observed 
at the 180 and 270 mg dose levels.  
Patients with PNH 
Study CP0514 
Pegcetacoplan  demonstrated  clinically  meaningful  improvements  in  hematologic  parameters  (e.g.,  Hb 
and LDH levels) with a SC dose of 270 mg/day in combination with eculizumab. However, three of four 
subjects transitioned to pegcetacoplan monotherapy during the study required a further increase in dose 
to 360 mg/day (1 of these 3 subjects needed a further increase of the equivalent of 440 mg/day) to 
maintain their hematologic response.

In  Cohort  4,  an  increase  in  Type  III  cells  as  a  proportion  of  the  clonal  distribution  of  total  RBCs  was 
observed in all 6 subjects.  
By Week 13, all Cohort 4 subjects had a decrease in C3 deposition on pooled Type II and III cells. This 
decrease was maintained for the 4 remaining Cohort 4 subjects through Week 105 (2 years of treatment) 
with some intermittent fluctuations. 
No consistent effect on C3 levels was observed following single dose of pegcetacoplan. All subjects in 
Cohorts 2, 3, and 4 had dose-related increases in C3 complement during multiple dosing. 
Study APL2-302 
During the run-in period there was a decrease in Type I PNH and Type II PNH RBCs, and an increase in 
Type III PNH RBCs. These changes were maintained in the pegcetacoplan treatment group but not the 
eculizumab treatment group during the RCP.  
The C3 levels increased with repeated dosing of pegcetacoplan. The mean C3 concentration at week 2 
increased by approximately 280% than baseline level and remained at similar level towards Week 16 
(from 0.942 g/L at baseline to 3.826 g/L at Week 16; CFB of 2.824 g/L). In the eculizumab group the 
C3 levels increased from baseline to Week 2, but then decreased to below baseline at Week 16 (CFB of 
–0.006 g/L). 
Study 202 
In all subjects of this study, the applicant found an increase from baseline in clonal distribution of types 
II + III PNH RBCs.  
Noticeable decrease of C3 deposition on types II + III RBCs and C3 deposition on type III RBCs from 
respective baselines were observed in 2 subjects.  
Pegcetacoplan demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in hematologic parameters (eg, Hb and 
LDH levels).  
C3 levels increased from baseline in all subjects and peaked at approximately Day 43, then remained 
relatively stable, generally at a level of 200% or more than baseline, for the duration of the study. 
Study 204 
The sum of the mean clonal distributions of PNH RBCs (percentage of PNH Type II + Type III) was close 
to 84% of overall PNH RBCs when approaching Day 365. 
The  proportion  of  PNH  granulocytes  and  monocytes  was  minimally  changed  during  the  course  of  the 
study. 
Further supporting the intended pharmacological activity of pegcetacoplan, C3d deposition on Type II 
and Type III RBCs was decreased after pegcetacoplan treatment.  
Pegcetacoplan administration demonstrated improvements in hematologic parameters (e.g., Hb and LDH 
levels). 
C3 concentrations increased with repeated dosing of pegcetacoplan. Change from baseline in mean C3 
was 2.310 g/L at Day 29, 2.921 g/L at Day 85, and 2.483 g/L at Day 365. Mean C3 concentrations at 
Day 29 increased by approximately 250% versus baseline level. C3 subsequently remained at a similar 
level as observed serum C3 concentrations generally overlapped from Day 29 to Day 365.

There was no meaningful effect of pegcetacoplan treatment on CH50 values in all four studies in subjects 
with PNH (Study APL2-302, Study 204, Study CP0514, and Study 202) (Table 6).  
Table 4: CH50 Absolute Value and Change From Baseline by Visit For Study APL2-302, Study

AH50/AP50 
A reduction of AP50 from baseline level was observed with pegcetacoplan treatment in both Study 204 
and Study 202 that evaluated treatment-naïve subjects with PNH. A maximum decrease of approximately 
70% from baseline was observed at Day 29 in Study 204, while mean observed AP50 level subsequently 
recovered to approximately half of the baseline value at Day 169 and remained at a similar level at Day 
365.  Individual  variations  were  noted  in  AP50  percentage  throughout  the  Study  202.  However,  all 
subjects experienced a decrease from baseline in AP50 through to Day 365.  
Low  AH50  values  at  baseline  in  Study  CP0514  and  Study  APL2-302  were  consistent  with  prior  and 
concomitant  treatment  with  eculizumab,  a  strong  inhibitor  of  both  classical  and  alternative  pathway 
complement  hemolytic  activity.  AH50  increased  with  the  cessation  of  eculizumab  in  both  studies. 
Subjects in Study CP0514 received co-administration of eculizumab and pegcetacoplan for a long period 
of  time  and  no  further  effect  on  AH50  as  a  result  of  pegcetacoplan  treatment  could  therefore  be 
determined  in  the  single-dose  phase  or  in  the  multiple-dose  phase  until  after  1  year  of  treatment.

value stayed close to 50% of normal at Week 16 (or Day 113).

Across all 4 studies with PNH subjects, C3 levels increased after pegcetacoplan dosing and maintained 
at a level that was more than 200% than baseline values from Day 43 through the rest of respective 
treatment period, indicating robust and sustained target C3 engagement (

According to the results of Study CP0514, pegcetacoplan showed pharmacological activity at a daily SC 
dose dose of 180 mg. The cumulative data of Study 204, Study CP0514 (Cohort 4), and Study 202 (a 
Phase 2a study) suggested that most subjects (at least 22 of 30) had a clinically significant response 
with pegcetacoplan at 270 mg/day dose. Six of 30 subjects (20%) required a 360 mg/day dosage or 
higher to sustain robust clinical response during long-term treatment of pegcetacoplan monotherapy. In 
Study APL2-302, the Applicant investigated the effectiveness of less frequent dosing regimens, such as 
twice-weekly  dosing.  On  the  basis  of  preliminary  PK  modelling,  a  twice  weekly  dose  of  1080  mg  was 
selected.   
The effect of pegcetacoplan on cardiac conduction 
Data  are  not  available  for  a  situation  that  may  pose  a  risk  for  a  suprapharmacologic  exposure  of 
pegcetacoplan,  such  as  a  potential  drug-drug  interaction.  Based  on  the  class  and  structure  of  the 
molecule,  the  Applicant  does  not  expect  drug-drug  interactions.  In  addition,  since  the  excretion  of 
pegcetacoplan is almost entirely renal, the Applicant also does not expect that hepatic insufficiency to 
increase pegcetacoplan exposure.

There  appears  to  be  no  large  effect  of  pegcetacoplan  on  heart  rate.  No  subjects  met  bradycardic  or 
tachycardic outlier criteria. These findings are of no clinical significance. 
No signal of a clinically significant effect on PR was observed with pegcetacoplan. No subjects met PR 
outlier criteria. 
No signal of a clinically significant effect on QRS was observed with pegcetacoplan. No subjects met QRS 
outlier criteria. 
The placebo corrected QTcF change from baseline ranged from -8.6 ms in the 360 mg daily treatment 
group (Day 42) to 25.4 ms in the 1300 mg twice-weekly treatment group (Day 56). In the group with 
the largest sample size, the 1080 mg twice weekly treatment group, the largest value for ΔΔQTcF was 
15.8 ms (90% 2-sided upper confidence bound 29.0 ms) on Day 56 (n=20). Given the very small sample 
sizes of these cohorts (generally only 4 subjects to start other than in the 1080 mg weekly treatment 
group), these data are difficult to interpret (Figure 3 and  Figure 4).

The timepoint analysis demonstrated no clinically significant effect of pegcetacoplan or eculizumab on 
heart rate. No patients met bradycardic outlier criteria, while one patient in the eculizumab treatment 
met tachycardic outlier criteria.  
The timepoint analysis demonstrated no clinically significant effect of pegcetacoplan or eculizumab on 
PR interval. No patients met PR outlier criteria.  
The timepoint analysis demonstrated no clinically significant effect of pegcetacoplan or eculizumab on 
QRS duration. No patients met QRS outlier criteria.  
The mean changes from baseline for QTcF for the pegcetacoplan and ecluizumab treatment groups during 
the RCP ranged from -0.6 to 1.7 and -3.6 to 1.2 ms respectively; these results are of no clinical relevance. 
None of the timepoints for the pegcetacoplan or eculizumab groups demonstrated a 90% two sided upper 
bound for QTcF change from baseline that approached or exceeded 10 ms, demonstrating no signal of 
any  effect  of  pegcetacoplan  on  cardiac  repolarization.  During the  RCP,  the  highest  QTcF  change  from 
baseline in the pegcetacoplan treatment group was 3.0 ms (UCL 4.8 ms). For the eculizumab treatment 
group, the highest QTcF change from baseline was 0 ms (UCL 6.3 ms). These findings are of no clinical 
significance (Figure 5). 
Figure 5. QTcF Interval: Mean Change From Baseline (APL-EX20-CP-004, Figure 7) 
The results of the PK-PD model show that the slope of the relationship between ΔQTcF and pegcetacoplan 
serum concentration was flat to slightly positive (P=0.5151) and the overall predicted baseline corrected 
value at the mean Cmax for pegcetacoplan was 1.4 ms (90% 2-sided UCI 2.9 ms). There was a substantial 
negative intercept, probably related to the lack of low pegcetacoplan serum concentrations ( Figure 6).

pegcetacoplan  serum  concentration  was  flat.  With  the  inclusion  of  data  when  pegcetacoplan  serum 
concentrations were 0 or low, the intercepts were all small. The model predicted mean ΔQTcF (Sensitivity

Several  patients  developed  new,  minor  ECG  morphologic  findings  in  this  study.  In  the  pegcetacoplan

segment depression (< 0.1 mV). A review of these ECGs demonstrated only nonspecific ST and T wave 
changes  that  were  not  suggestive  of  ischemia  or  pericardial  process,  and  which  did  not  appear  to  be 
clinically significant.  
PD interactions 
Concomitant treatment with pegcetacoplan and eculizumab had no meaningful impact on CH50 relative 
to baseline and had negligible impact on AH50/AP50 relative to baseline. According to the Applicant, the

pharmacological effect on CH50 and AH50/AP50 of both drugs is largely overlapping with limited additive 
effects.  
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
A  sigmoidal  Emax  direct  effect  model  described  the  pegcetacoplan  concentration  and  Hb/LDL  level  in 
subjects with PNH. 
Exposure Relationship to Hemoglobin Response in Subjects With PNH 
The most common pegcetacoplan dosing regimens were 1080 mg twice weekly (81 subjects) or 270 mg 
once  daily  (30  subjects)  with  sorbitol  (81  subjects)  or  dextrose  (26  subjects)  formulations.  Hb  level 
increases with increasing pegcetacoplan concentration, but that the relationship is non-linear over the 
range of pegcetacoplan concentrations in the observed data. 
The  maximal  effect  was  a  36.3%  increase  from  baseline  with  an  EC50  of  272  μg/mL  the  sigmoidal 
relationship is steep over the observed pegcetacoplan concentration range (Hill coefficient of 5.85).  
The  E-R  analyses  showed  that  270  mg/day  and  1080  mg  SC  twice-weekly  dosing  regimen  are  both 
effective  for  improving  Hb  in  subjects  with  PNH.  Exposure  from  270  mg/day  dosage  is  expected  to 
achieve at least 95% of the maximal predicted Hb response. However, exposure from 1080 mg twice-
weekly dosage is expected to achieve at least 99% of the maximal predicted Hb response.  
Individuals  with  lower  baseline  Hb  values  are  predicted  to  have  greater  Hb  response,  in  terms  of 
proportional increase from baseline. However, individuals with renal impairment are anticipated to have 
a lesser Hb response than those with normal renal function at baseline. 
Exposure Relationship to Lactate Dehydrogenase Response in Subjects with PNH 
Median baseline LDH levels were approximately 10-fold higher in eculizumab-naive patients enrolled in 
Study 202 (2585 IU/L) and Study 204 (2227 IU/L) compared to patients receiving eculizumab at baseline 
in Study APL2-302 and Study CP0514 (225 IU/L), consistent with the expected pharmacological effect 
of eculizumab. 
For eculizumab treatment-naive patients, the maximal effect of pegcetacoplan was estimated as a 90.8% 
decrease in LDH level from a baseline of 2117 IU/L with an EC50 of 173 μg/mL. For subjects on eculizumab 
treatment at baseline, the maximal effect was a 32.5% decrease from a baseline of 248 IU/L with an 
EC50 of 250 μg/mL. A common Hill coefficient was estimated at 3.84 for both conditions, suggesting a 
steep  pegcetacoplan  concentration-LDH  response  relationship  over  the  observed  pegcetacoplan 
concentration range. 
Treatment with eculizumab at baseline influenced baseline LDH level, Emax, and EC50. As a result, median 
LDH levels at steady state following pegcetacoplan 1080 mg twice weekly are predicted to be 231 IU/L 
for  eculizumab-naive  subjects  and  177  IU/L  for  subjects  with  prior  eculizumab  treatment.  However, 
pegcetacoplan 1080 mg twice weekly effectively controls LDH: 78.4% and 97.4% of eculizumab-naive 
and eculizumab-treated subjects, respectively, achieved LDH levels below 1.5 times the upper limit of 
normal (ULN = 226 IU/L).  
The LDH exposure-response analysis showed that the 270 mg/day and 1080 mg twice-weekly dosing 
regimen are both effective for LDH response. Exposure from 270 mg/day dosage is expected to achieve 
at least 90% of the maximal predicted LDH response. However, exposure from 1080 mg twice-weekly 
dosage  is  expected  to  achieve  at  least  95%  and  99%  of  the  maximal  predicted  LDH  response  in 
eculizumab-treated  subjects  and  eculizumab-naive  subjects.,  respectively,  with  71.6%  of  all  subjects 
predicted to achieve LDH levels below the ULN.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/629737/2021  
Page 49/150 
 
 
 
 
LDH levels at steady-state pegcetacoplan concentrations following 1080 mg twice-weekly are predicted 
to  be  only  1.25-fold  (90%  CI:  0.999-1.55)  higher  in  treatment-naive  patients  than  in  those  with 
eculizumab  treatment  at  baseline,  suggesting  that  pegcetacoplan  monotherapy  as  initial  treatment 
provides LDH control similar to that of sequential therapy with eculizumab and pegcetacoplan. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics: 
Methods 
Serum pegcetacoplan concentration 
Concentrations  of  pegcetacoplan  (APL2)  were  determined  in  human  serum  using  validated  a  liquid 
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method.  
Immunogenicity 
•  ADA assay 
In early clinical studies (CP0713, CP1014, 401, CP0514 and 6 subjects from study 204), ELISA-based 
ADA assay  was used to detect antibodies against pegcetacoplan in human serum. The drug tolerance of 
the assay was very low. 
In later clinical studies (101, 205, 102, 202, 204 and pivotal study 302), a standard multi-tiered approach 
was  employed  including  screening,  confirmatory  and  titer  assays  to  evaluate  anti-drug  antibodies  in 
accordance  with  EMA  Guideline  on 
Immunogenicity  assessment  of 
therapeutic  proteins 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006 Rev 1). 
In  those  studies,  ECL-based  ADA  assay  was  used  to  detect  antibodies  against  peptide  moiety  of 
pegcetacoplan in parallel with ELISA-based ADA assay to detect antibodies against PEG moiety of the 
drug molecule.  
Main  issue  of  both  assays  for  antibodies  against  pegcetacoplan  peptide  (BAL-17-143-048-REP  and 
190339VMES_APWM) was the low drug tolerance which could lead to false negative results. 
Anti-pegcetacoplan  peptide  antibodies  are  being  further  evaluated  in  study  302  at  Weeks  32,  48  and 
during the Follow-up at weeks 54 and 60. The low assay drug tolerance could affect reliability of ADA 
detection at these time points. Anti-pegcetacoplan peptide antibodies will also be evaluated in study 307, 
an  open-label  extension  study  to  evaluate  the  long-term  safety  and  efficacy  of  pegcetacoplan  in  the 
treatment of PNH. The Applicant will attempt to further improve drug tolerance of the assay used for the 
analysis of patient samples from studies 302, 307 and 308.  
NAb assay 
A  competitive  ligand  binding  ECL-assay  was  developed  to  detect  neutralising  anti-pegcetacoplan 
antibodies  in  human  serum  samples.  All  the  samples  were  handled  within  the  validated  stability 
conditions. 
Population PK analysis (APL-EX20-CP-002) 
The  base  model  included  the  following  structural  covariates:  lyophilised  formulation  (FORM4)  on 
subcutaneous bioavailability (F1), C3 level on CL and V2, and PNH patient status divided into Phase 1 or 
2 (PNH2) and Phase 3 studies (PNH3) on CL. After stepwise backward elimination procedure based on 
the  likelihood  ratio  test,  weight  was  found  to  be  a  significant  covariate  on  CL/F  and  V/F.  No  other 
significant covariates were identified including race (Japanese vs Caucasian) and ADA (ad-hoc analysis).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/629737/2021  
Page 50/150 
 
 
 
All PK parameters, both fixed and random effects, of the final model were estimated with good precision 
(RSE <20%). IIV estimates were reduced compared to the base model. All GOF plots showed that the 
model  adequately  described  the  observed  pegcetacoplan  concentrations.  The  VPCs  showed  that  the 
model captured the global trend and the variability of the concentration vs time data reasonably well. 
Therefore, the final population PK model is deemed adequate for simulations.  
Absorption 
PK  evaluation  in  healthy  subjects  showed  that  following  a  single  SC  dose  (Study  CP0713-1), 
pegcetacoplan is slowly absorbed with a median Tmax ranging from 108 to 144 hours (4.5 to 6 days). 
This is reflected in the SmPC.  
Bioavailability 
In the Pop PK analysis, bioavailability of the sorbitol, mannitol and dextrose formulation was estimated 
to  be  76.6%,  whereas  for  the  lyophilized  formulation  the  estimation  was  94.7%.  Bioavailability  as 
obtained by the Pop PK analysis is stated in the SmPC. 
The preferred site of administration across the studies was abdomen, but if this site was not well tolerated 
by the patient, thigh or upper arm could be selected as an alternative. Even limited data are available 
with injection sites other than abdomen, no clear difference linked to injection site was evidenced. The 
SmPC allows administration in all three sites.  
Bioequivalence 
No  formal  bioavailability  or  bioequivalence  studies  were  conducted.  An  inter-study  comparison  of  the 
dextrose formulation (used in early clinical studies CP1014, 204, CP0514 and CP0713-1) and the acetate 
buffer–based,  sorbitol  containing  formulation  (study  101  and  pivotal  study  302)  showed  a  similar 
disposition profile. These are also the two formulations used in the majority of subjects across the clinical 
development program.  
Different  formulations  were  assessed  as  covariates  in  the  Pop  PK  model.  All  formulations  (dextrose, 
mannitol  and  lyophilized)  showed  slightly  higher  predicted  Cavg,ss  and  Cmax,ss  than  the  reference 
sorbitol formulation, but only 38% higher exposure with lyophilized formulation was deemed significant, 
which was consistent with higher estimated bioavailability for this formulation. Lyophilized formulation 
was  used  in  special  population  studies  (102  and  205).  Steady-state  exposures  obtained  by  dextrose 
formulation  are  considered  similar  to  steady-state  exposures  achieved  by  the  sorbitol  formulation. 
Sorbitol formulation was used in the pivotal study 302 and is planned for commercialisation.  
In conclusion, considering the very slow absorption of pegcetacoplan, similar t1/2 between the dextrose 
and sorbitol formulation and similar steady-state exposures achieved, the absence of formal BE study 
can  be  accepted.  Moreover,  the  pivotal  study  used  the  sorbitol  formulation  which  is  the  proposed 
commercial formulation. 
Distribution 
In the SmPC section 5.2, the Applicant states predicted volume of distribution for PNH patients based on 
the PopPK model (3.9 L (CV 35%)). This is considered acceptable. 
Elimination 
Elimination pathways and metabolism of pegcetacoplan were not specifically studied. The metabolism of 
the peptide moiety of the drug molecule is expected to be driven by catabolism to amino acids. However, 
no dedicated investigation of pegcetacoplan metabolism has been made.  
With regards to PEG moiety, like other High molecular weight pegylated drugs, the elimination is very 
slow. The drug clearance equates approximately 0.3% the glomerular filtration rate. However, it was not

agreed that the predominant elimination of the drug product is by renal route. Preclinical study 17MTX-
001  was  performed  in  Cynomolgus  Monkey  and  investigated  3H-radiolabelled  pegcetacoplan 
(synthesized using [3H]-labeled valine). Therefore, the radiolabeled material recovered in urine is tracing 
only  peptide  moiety  of  pegcetacoplan  and  could  not  inform  the  elimination  of  the  PEG  moiety.  The 
following information is implemented in the SmPC (paragraph 5-2 Metabolism/ Elimination): “Based on 
its  PEGylated  peptide  structure,  the  metabolism  of  pegcetacoplan  is  expected  to  occur  via  catabolic 
pathways and be degraded into small peptides, amino acids, and PEG. Results of a radiolabelled study 
in Cynomolgus monkeys suggest the primary route of elimination of the labelled peptide moiety is via 
urinary  excretion.  Although  the  elimination  of  PEG  was  not  studied,  it  is  known  to  undergo  renal 
excretion.” 
Target population 
A population PK model has been developed in order to elucidate the PKs of pegcetacoplan. The population 
PK analysis (APL EX20-CP-002) predicted lower pegcetacoplan exposure in subjects with PNH compared 
to healthy subjects. The effective half-life of pegcetacoplan at 1080 mg SC twice weekly was estimated 
as 8.0 days for adult patients with PNH compared with 10.1 days in healthy subjects, however, the 90% 
prediction intervals are largely overlapping which is in line with the observed data.  
Immunogenicity 
Samples from 6 subjects from study 204 tested initially for ADAs  were negative and were planned to be 
re-analysed by a more specific method.  
In the later clinical studies, more specific methods were used to detect antibodies against the peptide 
moiety of the molecule and antibodies against the PEG moiety. Overall, a low frequency of anti-peptide 
antibodies was observed with 8 out of 177 subjects (4.5%) having a confirmed positive assay result. The 
interpretation of this result should be taken with care due to low drug tolerance of both assays employed. 
On the other hand, a very high proportion of subjects had a confirmed positive assay result for anti-PEG 
antibodies  (145/177,  81.9%).  Mostly,  this  was  due  to  pre-existing  anti-PEG  antibodies  in  pre-dose 
samples. There was a low incidence of treatment-emergent (4.5%) or treatment-boosted (3.4%) anti-
PEG antibody response. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
According  to  the  study  205  results  there  were  no  meaningful  differences  in  PK  parameters  between 
control  group  and  group  with  severe  renal  impairment.  It  is  agreed  that  under  the  experimental 
conditions of the study, no differences in primary or secondary PK parameters was observed between 
the  severe  impaired  subjects  and  the  control  group.  However,  the  study  was  conducted  after 
administration of a single 270 mg dose. The tested dose was much lower (1/4) than the claimed unitary 
1080 mg dose. The response is solely supported by data from the population-PK analysis. Based on this 
analysis, where CLcr was tested as a continuous covariate, no significant effect was evidenced. Of note, 
very few data from patients with severely impaired renal function (1.7 % in respectively severe and end-
stage patients) are included in the analyzed dataset. Even in patients with moderately impaired renal 
function, the available data are rather scarce (6.3 %). The SmPC accordingly states that minimal data 
are available for patients with renal impairment administered pegcetacoplan 1080 mg twice weekly.  
Hepatic impairment 
Considering the fact that the product is a peptide; the lack of dedicated studies in subjects with hepatic 
impairment is justified. It is agreed that a dose adjustment in this patient population is not warranted. 
Body weight 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/629737/2021  
Page 52/150 
 
 
 
PNH  patients  with  body  weight  below  50  kg  (5th  percentile in  the  analysis  data  set)  are  predicted  to 
have  up  to  34%  higher  Cavg,ss  values  compared  to  a  reference  70  kg  subject.  Although  not  many 
patients with body weight <50 kg are expected in clinical practice, the impact on safety of this increase 
in exposure is not known. The SmPC reflects information with regards to the impact of body weight below 
50 kg on pegcetacoplan exposure and limited safety information for those patients.  
Elderly 
Dataset included patients with age range from 19-81 years. Based on the results of the pop PK analysis, 
age  did  not  have  clinically  relevant  effect  on  pegcetacoplan  PK  and  on  model  predicted  Cavg,ss  and 
Cmax,ss in PNH patients.  
Race/ Ethnicity: 
Inter  study  comparison  did  not  show  any  meaningful  effect  of  Japanese  ethnicity  and  popPK  did  not 
identified  race  as  a  significant  covariate.  However,  the  conclusion  made  from  this  analysis  should  be 
sought cautiously as very scarce data are available in non-white patients/subjects (black, Hispanic and 
Asians). This is reflected in the SmPC.  
Pharmacodynamics 
Complement C3 levels increased by more than 200% from baseline levels with increasing pegacetoplan 
dose in multi dose studies. These findings indicate that pegcetacoplan interacts with complement C3.   
No effect on complement CH50 was observed with pegcetacoplan. 
A reduction of AP50 from baseline level was observed with multiple-dose of pegacetacoplan in Study 202 
and Study 204. The results of Study CP5014 and Study APL2-302 showed that pegcetacoplan reduces 
complement AH50 and demonstrated inferiority of pegcetacoplan versus eculizumab in reducing AH50. 
The  findings  for  AH50/AP50  suggested  that  repeated  dosing of  pegcetacoplan  led  to  a  persistent  and 
partial inhibition of alternative complement pathway haemolytic activity.  
The Applicant considers that the increase in Type II+III PNH RBCs indicates a reduction in haemolysis, 
due to protection of the PNH RBCs, and corresponding to the rise in Hb. This is acceptable. In addition, 
this increase in Type II+III PNH RBCs was higher in pegcetacoplan arm than in eculizumab arm which 
could  show  a  higher  activity  of  pegcetacoplan  compared  to  eculizumab  in  the  control  of  haemolysis. 
However, the impact of pegcetacoplan on PNH RBCs percent Type III (RBC with absent levels of CD55 
and CD59) was higher than on PNH RBCs percent Type II (RBC with reduced levels of CD55 and CD59). 
The Applicant provided a discussion regarding this different impact observed depending on the Type of 
PNH red blood cells and clarifications are considered acceptable. The Applicant also provided an additional 
analysis assessing the impact of transfusions and the results are in concordance with those reported in 
Study APL2-302 16-week CSR.  
Pegcetacoplan treatment resulted in the improvement of Hb level and reduction of absolute reticulocyte 
count, LDH and total bilirubin. 
Based  on  these  results,  repeated  dosing  of  pegcetacoplan  with  270-360  mg  daily  or  1080  mg  twice-
weekly leads to control of both intravascular and extravascular haemolysis. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Exposure-response  analyses  have  been  conducted  for  biomarkers  of  clinical  response  Hb  and  LDH.  A 
sigmoidal  Emax  direct  effect  model  described  the  pegcetacoplan  concentration  and  Hb/LDL  level  in 
subjects with PNH reasonably well.  
Assessment report

The maximal effect of pegacetacoplan was estimated as a 36.3% increase in Hb level from baseline with 
an EC50 of 272 µg/ml. For eculizumab treatment-naive patients, the maximal effect of pegcetacoplan 
was  estimated  as  a  90.8%  decrease  in  LDH  level  from  a  baseline  with  an  EC50  of  173  μg/mL.  The 
maximal  effect  was  a  32.5%  decrease  from  a  baseline  with  an  EC50  of  250  μg/mL  for  subjects  on 
eculizumab treatment at baseline. The E-R analyses showed that 270 mg/day and 1080 mg SC twice-
weekly  dosing  regimen  are  both  effective  for  improving  Hb  and  control  of  LDL  in  subjects  with  PNH. 
Exposure from 270 mg/day dosage is expected to achieve at least 95% of the maximal predicted Hb 
response and at least 90% of the maximal predicted LDH response. However, exposure from 1080 mg 
twice-weekly dosage is expected to achieve at least 99% of the maximal predicted Hb respon of all PNH 
subjects  and  at  least  95%  and  99%  of  the  maximal  predicted  LDH  response  in  eculizumab-treated 
subjects and eculizumab-naive subjects.    
The dose and dosing regimens (1080 mg SC twice-weekly) selected for the Phase 3 studies are adequate. 
The effect of pegcetacoplan on cardiac conduction 
The Applicant did not conduct “Thorough QT/QTc Study”. Instead of that study, the applicant performed 
the analysis (APL-EX20-CP-004) which evaluated the effect of pegacetacoplan on ECG parameters in the 
Phase 3 Study APL2302 and the Phase 1 Study 101. In addition, the Applicant considered that it was not 
necessary to evaluate the effect of pegcetacoplan at supratherapeutic doses on the QT interval. These 
studies  were  also  conducted  without  a  separate  positive  control  group.  Study  APL2-302  did  not  have 
concurrent placebo control group.    
The  explanation  regarding  the  Applicant’s  claim  that  it  was  not  necessary  to  evaluate  the  effect  of 
pegcetacoplan  at  supratherapeutic  doses  on  the  QT/QTc  interval  is  acceptable.  The  lack  of  a  positive 
control and lack of the placebo control group in Study APL2-302 is drawback for the results interpretation.  
According to these analyses, the Applicant concluded that pegcetacoplan has no clear effect on heart 
rate, PR and QRS interval duration, cardiac repolarization (QT interval corrected for heart rate), or other 
ECG parameters. In Study 2-302, there no effect on heart rate, PR and QRS interval duration, cardiac 
repolarization (QTc), or other electrocardiopraphic parameters. However, in Study APL2-101, the placebo 
corrected QTcF change from baseline was 25.4 ms in the 1300 mg twice-weekly treatment group (Day 
56). Then, in the group with the largest sample size, the 1080 mg twice weekly treatment group, the 
largest value for ΔΔQTcF was 15.8 ms (90% 2-sided upper confidence bound 29.0 ms) on Day 56 (n=20). 
The Applicant did not interpret the results of Study APL2-101 due to very small sample size of the cohorts 
in  that  study.  Considering  the  results  of  Study  APL2-101  (only  study  with  a  placebo  control)  and 
considering two clinical significant QT prolongations observed in one subject in Study 204, the Applicant 
provided a discussion on the observed QT/QTc prolongations, possible underlying reasons and further 
justified the claim that QT prolongation with pegcetacoplan is not expected based on overall available 
data. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall,  the  clinical  pharmacology  package  available  with  pegcetacoplan  is  considered  sufficient  to 
support the marketing authorization for the proposed indication.

2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.6.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Early clinical evaluation of repeated dosing of pegcetacoplan in subjects with PNH was conducted in a 
Phase  1b  study  (Study  CP0514) in  subjects  receiving  treatment  with  eculizumab.  Initially,  daily  5
mg 
(Cohort 1) and 30-mg (Cohort 2) SC doses of pegcetacoplan were tested for 28 days. PK data from the 
SAD and MAD studies in healthy subjects (which were conducted in parallel to the early cohorts of the 
-
Phase 1b study) supported the escalation to 180 mg in Cohort 3. 
In  Study  CP0514,  the  lowest  pegcetacoplan  dose  with  pharmacologic  activity  was  180  mg  daily  SC. 
Improved efficacy was observed with a daily SC dose of 270 mg. Specifically, all 6 subjects in Cohort 4 
had a clinically meaningful improvements in hematologic parameters (e.g. Hb and LDH levels) with a SC 
dose  of  270  mg/d  in  combination  with  eculizumab.  Four  subjects  transitioned  to  pegcetacoplan 
monotherapy during the study, and of these, 3 required a further increase in dose to 360 mg/day (1 of 
these  3  subjects  needed  a  further  increase  of  the  equivalent  of  440  mg/day)  to  maintain  their 
hematologic response. 
Repeated  dosing  of  pegcetacoplan  in  20  subjects  with  PNH  naive  to  treatment  with  a  complement 
inhibitor was conducted in Study 204. In this setting, pegcetacoplan again demonstrated efficacy at a 
daily  SC  dose  of  270  mg,  as  evidenced  by  improvements  in  Hb  levels  and  reductions  in  LDH  levels. 
Specifically,  17  subjects  received  pegcetacoplan  at  a  daily  SC  dose  of  270  mg  for  at  least  364  days. 
Three of 20 subjects needed a dose adjustment from 270 mg/d to 360 mg/d during the study. 
The cumulative data of Study 204, Study CP0514 (Cohort 4), and Phase 2a Study 202 suggested that 
most subjects (at least 22 of 30) had a clinically meaningful response with pegcetacoplan monotherapy 
at 270 mg/d dose. A few subjects (6 of 30) needed a 360 mg/d dosage or higher to sustain robust clinical 
response during long-term treatment of pegcetacoplan monotherapy. The exposure of pegcetacoplan in 
these  subjects  at  270  mg/day,  as  measured  by  their  pegcetacoplan  serum  concentration,  was  lower 
when compared to that of the majority of other subjects on this same dose. With dose adjustment, both 
the exposure and clinical responses improved for these subjects. 
To reduce the burden of daily dosing on subjects and to promote dosing compliance, the effectiveness 
of less frequent dosing regimens, such as twice-weekly dosing, was investigated. A twice-weekly dose 
of 1080 mg was selected as the dosing regimen for the registrational trials on the basis of preliminary 
PK modelling, which predicted a pegcetacoplan serum level for this regimen between those observed for 
the  270  mg  and  360  mg  daily  dose  regimens,  potentially  striking  a  balance  between  identifying  a 
minimally effective dose and optimizing the potential clinical response for a broad PNH patient population. 
The pegcetacoplan serum concentration predicted for 1080 mg twice weekly SC dosing was confirmed 
in Study 101 in healthy subjects. 
Population PK modelling based on pooled data from 10 clinical studies, including data up to Week 16 
from Study APL2-302, confirmed that the pegcetacoplan exposure achieved in subjects with PNH at a 
dose of 1080 mg SC twice weekly is intermediate to those predicted for doses of 270 mg and 360 mg 
SC once daily. 
In  Study  APL2-302,  the  pegcetacoplan  dosing  regimen  was  1080  mg  twice-weekly.  Although  dose 
escalation  to  a  regimen  of  1080  mg  every  3  days  was  allowed,  this  change  in  dose  frequency  was 
implemented in only 1 subject through Week 16. Therefore, based on the results of Study APL2-302, a 
dose  of  regimen  of  1080  mg  twice-weekly  has  been  determined  to  meet  the  clinical  needs  of  PNH 
patients.

The exposure-response model for Hb provides support for the hypothesis that the Phase 3 dose regimen 
of  1080  mg  twice  weekly  is  an  effective  dose  for  Hb  response.  Steady-state  pegcetacoplan  serum 
concentrations  are  expected  to  reach  99%  of  the  maximal  predicted  Hb  response.  The  exposure-
response model for LDH also provides support for the hypothesis that the Phase 3 dose regimen of 1080 
mg twice weekly is an effective dose for LDH response. Steady-state pegcetacoplan serum concentrations 
are expected to reach 95% of the maximal predicted LDH response, regardless of prior treatment with 
eculizumab. 
2.6.5.2.  Main study 
APL2-302  study:  A  phase  3,  randomized,  multicenter,  open-label,  active-
comparator controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pegcetacoplan in 
patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (pnh) 
Methods 
Study APL2-302 is considered the pivotal study to provide the evidence of efficacy and safety. This is a 
global, Phase 3, prospective, randomized, multicenter, open-label, active comparator controlled study. 
Its objective is to confirm treatment efficacy and safety of pegcetacoplan monotherapy for the treatment 
of PNH in subjects aged ≥18 years who were receiving eculizumab therapy but continued to have Hb 
levels <10.5 g/dL. Subjects were randomized to receive pegcetacoplan 1080 mg twice weekly or every 
3 days if clinically indicated or their current dosage of eculizumab. This head-to-head comparator trial 
was designed to demonstrate superiority of pegcetacoplan to eculizumab monotherapy in subjects with 
PNH currently on treatment with eculizumab as measured by change in Hb level at Week 16. The 16-
week RCP is completed; the 32-week open-label period is ongoing. 
After completion of the randomized controlled period (RCP) (the end of Week 16), subjects continue into 
a  32-week  open-label  pegcetacoplan  period  in  which  all  subjects  receive  twice-weekly  doses  of 
pegcetacoplan 1080 mg. Subjects who received eculizumab in the RCP received pegcetacoplan in addition 
to eculizumab for 4 weeks (Weeks 17 to 20). After completion of the 52-week treatment period (Week 
48), subjects are offered entry into an open-label extension study. Subjects who do not enter the open-
label extension study exit the study after 2 additional safety visits. 
The planned length of participation in the study overall for each subject was a maximum of approximately 
72 weeks, including an 8-week screening period, 52-week treatment period and, for those do not enter 
the open-label extension study, a 12-week follow-up period.  
This report includes data through Week 16, which is the primary endpoint of this study.

Forty-four sites participated in this study across Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, 
Russia, South Korea, Spain, United Kingdom, and the United States of America.  
Study Participants  
At  screening  (unless  otherwise  specified),  adult  subjects  were  required  to  fulfill  all  of  the  following 
inclusion criteria to be eligible for participation in the study, notably 
Primary diagnosis of PNH confirmed by high-sensitivity flow cytometry, on treatment with eculizumab. 
Dosage of eculizumab must have been stable for at least 3 months prior to the screening visit, Hb <10.5 
g/dL at the screening visit, ARC >1.0× the upper limit of normal (ULN) at the screening visit, platelet 
count of >50,000/mm3 at the screening visit, and absolute neutrophil count >500/mm3 at the screening 
visit. 
Treatments 
Pegcetacoplan  was  provided  as  a  sterile  solution,  54  mg/mL,  in  acetate-buffered  sorbitol  in  20-cc 
stoppered glass vials and was required to be stored refrigerated at 2 to 8 °C. 
Pegcetacoplan was administered as a 20-mL SC infusion.  
Starting on Day –28 (Visit 2), subjects received twice-weekly SC doses of 1080 mg of pegcetacoplan in 
addition to their current dosage of eculizumab until Day 1. Subjects maintained their eculizumab dose 
and  administration  schedule  as  prescribed,  regardless  of  study  visit  scheduling  or  the  pegcetacoplan 
administration schedule. 
Following completion of the run-in period, subjects were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either 1080 
mg of pegcetacoplan twice weekly or their current dosage of eculizumab. If a subject did not respond 
sufficiently  to  the  planned  dosage  of  1080  mg  twice  weekly  (for  subjects  receiving  pegcetacoplan 
monotherapy, if LDH was >2 × ULN), the dosing regimen could be changed to 1080 mg every third day 
upon agreement with the sponsor. 
Objectives 
The primary objectives of this study were to establish the efficacy and safety of pegcetacoplan compared 
with  those  of  eculizumab  in  subjects  with  PNH  who  continued  to  have  Hb  levels  <10.5  g/dL  despite 
treatment with eculizumab.

Questionnaire–Core 30 Scale (QLQ-C30) scores 
•  Number of packed red blood cell (PRBC) units transfused during the RCP [>Day 1 to Week 16 
and Week 4 to Week 16]. 
Sample size 
Sample size of 64 randomly assigned subjects (32 in each group). 
Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Subjects  who  met  all  the  eligibility  criteria  were  eligible  to  enter  the  4-week  run-in  period.  Following 
completion  of  the  run-in  period,  subjects  were  randomly  assigned  (1:1)  using  interactive  response 
technology to receive either pegcetacoplan or eculizumab.  
Treatment assignment was not blinded.  
Statistical methods 
A sample size of 64 randomly assigned subjects (32 in each group) provides 90% power (using a 2-sided 
test at the 5% level of significance) of obtaining a statistically significant difference between the groups 
with  the  primary  endpoint,  Week  16  CFB  in  Hb  level.  This  assumed  a  treatment  difference  between 
pegcetacoplan and eculizumab of 1 g/dL and a standard deviation for the CFB of 1.2 g/dL (effect size = 
0.833).  To  account  for  loss  of  power  due  to  discontinuations,  the  study  attempted  to  randomize  70 
subjects. It was anticipated that more than 70 subjects would need to enter the run-in period to achieve 
70 randomly assigned subjects. 
The  primary  analysis  was  carried  out  on  the  intent-to-treat  as  randomized  population.  The  primary 
efficacy endpoint was the  CFB in Hb level at Week  16 of the RCP. If a subject received a transfusion 
during the RCP or withdrew from the study, the Hb levels up to the transfusion or time of withdrawal 
were included. If a subject received a transfusion, the pretransfusion Hb value from the local laboratory 
was used; however, if it was not collected or missing, then the pretransfusion central laboratory Hb value 
was used. 
The  between-treatment-group  comparison  for  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  performed  using  a 
mixed-effect model for repeated measures (MMRM) (Mallinckrodt et al. 2008). 
The model included the treatment effect as fixed effect and will be adjusted on visits, stratification factors 
(number  of  PRBC  transfusion  prior  inclusion  /  <  4;  ≥4  and  platelet  count  at  screening  /  >100 000; 
≥100 000), visit-by-treatment interaction and covariate baseline Hb level.

The difference between pegcetacoplan and eculizumab mean Hb changes from baseline at Week 16 was 
calculated along with its 2-sided 95% CI and associated P value from the MMRM model. 
Intercurrent  events  (ICE)  that  were  considered  in  the  analysis  of  the  primary  objective  include 
transfusions, discontinuation of study treatment, and withdrawal from the study. 
Supportive analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint included the following: 
-  An MMRM analysis using the PP set using data up to ICE. 
-  An MMRM analysis using the mITT set using all available data (uncensored for transfusion) after 
Week 4. 
-  An MMRM analysis using data uncensored for transfusion from the ITT set, regardless of whether 
the Hb measurement was following a transfusion. 
-  An MMRM analysis using the completers set using data up to ICE. 
Key secondary endpoints were tested in a hierarchical manner after statistical significance was reached 
for the primary endpoint. Key secondary endpoints were tested first for non-inferiority and, if all were 
met, then superiority was tested sequentially for transfusion avoidance, ARC, LDH, and FACIT-Fatigue 
score using a closed-testing procedure at a significance level of 0.05.  
For  categorical  secondary  efficacy  endpoints,  the  number  and  percentage  of  subjects  meeting  the 
following  criteria  was  tabulated  by  treatment  group at  Week  16  and  the  superiority  test  was  used  to 
compare  the  2  treatment  groups:  Hb  response  (≥1  g/dL  increase  from  baseline  in  the  absence  of 
transfusion), Reticulocyte normalization (≤ULN), Hb normalization (≥ the lower limit of normal).

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint  
With the MMRM analysis, the least-square (LS) mean CFB in Hb at Week 16 in the pegcetacoplan and 
eculizumab groups was 2.37 g/dL and -1.47 g/dL, respectively (see the following table). The difference 
in LS mean CFB in Hb between the 2 groups of 3.84 g/dL was statistically significant (95% CI 2.33, 5.34; 
P<.0001) and higher than the pre-specified difference between pegcetacoplan and eculizumab of 1 g/dl. 
The primary endpoint has been reached. A large number of subjects received transfusions in eculizumab 
arm (n=33) compared to pegcetacoplan arm (n=5). These data reflect a superiority of pegcetacoplan 
compared to eculizumab in terms of efficacy of control of the disease.

Key Secondary Endpoints 
Key secondary endpoints were tested first for non-inferiority and, if all were met, then superiority was 
tested sequentially for transfusion avoidance, ARC, LDH, and FACIT-Fatigue score using a closed-testing 
procedure at a significance level of 0.05.  
Transfusion Avoidance 
The Figure below provides an overview of the results for the key secondary endpoints using a plot to 
display noninferiority margins and statistics.

Table 16: Summary for Number of Subjects With Transfusion Avoidance During Randomized 
Controlled Period (ITT Set) 
Pegcetacoplan met non-inferiority to eculizumab on transfusion avoidance, with 85.4% of pegcetacoplan 
subjects and 15.4% of eculizumab subjects achieving transfusion avoidance (nominal P value <.0001).

This result is significantly clinically relevant. The proportion of subjects who were transfusion avoidant 
was  similar  in  the  pegcetacoplan  group,  regardless  of  baseline  PRBC  transfusion  strata  or  baseline 
platelet strata, but not in the eculizumab group.

Pegcetacoplan  was  also  non-inferior  to  eculizumab  for  CFB  in  ARC,  a  marker  of  hematopoietic  bone 
marrow compensatory activity in the setting of anemia and/or hemolysis, with an LS mean difference of 
–163.6 × 109 cells/L (nominal P value <.0001).

LDH did not meet non-inferiority by the prespecified analysis. However, a greater percentage of subjects 
on  pegcetacoplan  achieved  LDH  normalization,  as  compared  with  eculizumab  (71%  vs  15%, 
respectively).

FACIT-Fatigue Score 
Table 19: MMRM Model: Change From Baseline in FACIT-Fatigue Score During Randomized

Noninferiority  for  the  FACIT-Fatigue  score  was  not  assessed  because  of  the  prespecified  hierarchical 
testing.  Of  note,  a  higher  numerical  improvements  were  seen  in  FACIT-Fatigue  score  in  the 
pegcetacoplan group as compared with the eculizumab group with a difference of 11.87 points (95% CI 
5.49, 18.25; nominal P value .0005).

Number of PRBC Units Transfused 
Number of PRBC units transfused during the RCP (>Day 1 to Week 16 and Week 4 to Week 16) was 
assessed as a secondary endpoint. Subjects in the pegcetacoplan group required fewer units of PRBCs 
to be transfused (Table 48). This table includes Subject 01010003, who discontinued before receiving a 
transfusion. 
The mean number of PRBC units required in the pegcetacoplan group was 0.6 and in the eculizumab 
group was 5.1 (95% CI: 2.0, 4.0). 
Results for the mITT set (Week 4 to Week 16) were identical to the ITT set.

Others analyses by subgroups 
The 2 treatment groups were generally similar at baseline with regard to number of subjects in each 
subgroup. No subjects in the eculizumab group were of Black/African American race, and 1 subject in 
the eculizumab group identified as Race: Other. 
Subgroup analyses by sex showed that men in the pegcetacoplan group had a mean CFB at Week 16 
that was approximately 1 g/dL greater than that of women in the pegcetacoplan group. 
The mean CFB at Week 16 in the eculizumab group was similar for women and men. 
Subgroup analyses by race showed that the greatest mean CFB in Hb at Week 16 in the pegcetacoplan 
group was seen in White subjects. Asian and Black/African American subjects in the pegcetacoplan group 
had a mean CFB that was approximately 1 g/dL lower than for White subjects. 
By age, subjects in the pegcetacoplan group were comparable in mean CFB at Week 16. 
Despite these differences, all pegcetacoplan subgroups achieved at least a 2 g/dL increase in Hb by Week 
16. 
Meaningful subgroup comparisons were not possible for the eculizumab arm given the large number of 
subjects who were removed from the analysis because of transfusions.

To preserve the Type 1 error rate, the key secondary endpoints were tested in 
a hierarchical manner after statistical significance was reached for the primary 
endpoint. Once one hypothesis tested not significant, all subsequent tests were 
not assessed.

Methodology: A single cohort of subjects was planned for evaluation. The study was closed for enrolment 
by the sponsor after 4 subjects were enrolled. 
All  subjects  in  this  study  received  pegcetacoplan  270  mg/day.  Patients  showing  evidence  of  clinical 
benefit could receive pegcetacoplan daily until Day 364.  
Main inclusion criteria: Subjects were at least 18 years old who were diagnosed with PNH, LDH levels ≥2 
times  the  ULN  and  had  received  a  transfusion  within  12  months  prior  to  screening.  Subjects  were 
excluded if they had received prior eculizumab. 
Efficacy results: 
Mean LDH level at baseline was 2548.8 U/L. Lactate dehydrogenase levels remained lower than baseline 
through Day 365 (mean CFB −2322.8 U/L). Three subjects (75%) had LDH ≤ULN, and all 4 subjects 
(100%) had LDH values ≤1.5× the ULN at Day 365. 
Mean haptoglobin level at baseline was 0.1 g/L. Mean haptoglobin at Day 365 was 0.18 g/L (mean CFB 
0.08 g/L). 
Mean hemoglobin (Hb) level at baseline was 7.73 g/dL. Mean Hb level remained above baseline through 
Day 365 (mean CFB 5.27 g/dL). Three subjects had Hb levels ≥LLN at Day 365. One subject had a mean 
Hb level of 10.14 g/dL, which was just outside of the normal range (LLN 11.6 g/dL). 
Mean FACIT-Fatigue score at baseline was 40.5. At Day 365 the mean score was 47.0 (mean CFB 6.5), 
and all subjects except 1 showed an improvement in score from baseline at Day 365. 
Mean ARC at baseline was 238.3/nL. Mean ARC remained below baseline through Day 365 (mean CFB 
−144.3/nL). Three subjects (75%) had ARCs ≤ULN at Day 365. 
Mean total bilirubin at baseline was 30.85 μmol/L. At Day 365 the mean CFB was −21.53 μmol/L. Three 
subjects (75%) had bilirubin levels ≤ULN, and all 4 subjects (100%) had a bilirubin level ≤1.5 × ULN at 
Day 365. 
No subject required a transfusion during the study. All 4 subjects were transfusion-dependent prior to 
entering the study, with a transfusion history ranging from 2 to 9 PRBC transfusions in the prior year. 
All subjects except 1 showed an increase in total LASA score baseline at Day 365. Two subjects had an 
increase from baseline at Day 365 of greater than 100 points. 
In conclusion, these data should be taken with cautions as based on only 4 subjects. Pegcetacoplan at 
the dose of 270 mg daily showed preliminary efficacy results in patients who had not already received 
eculizumab. 
APL2-CP-PNH-204 study 
A phase 1b, open-label, multiple ascending dose, pilot study to assess the safety, preliminary efficacy 
and pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered pegcetacoplan in subjects with PNH 
Primary endpoints were efficacy and safety endpoints. 
The primary efficacy endpoints were CFB and percentage CFB in LDH, haptoglobin, and Hb. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were CFB in FACIT-Fatigue score, CFB and percentage CFB in ARC and 
total bilirubin level, and number of RBC transfusions per month. 
Methodology: The study was planned to enroll approximately 23 subjects: 3 subjects in Cohort 1 and up 
to 20 subjects in Cohort 2. Subjects could participate in more than 1 cohort. 
Assessment report

Dosage: 180 mg/day in Cohort 1 or 270 mg/day (increasable up to 360 mg/day if clinically indicated on 
the basis of response) in Cohort 2, administered SC. Patients showing evidence of clinical benefit could 
receive pegcetacoplan daily until Day 364.  
Main criteria: Subjects were aged ≥18 years with PNH, LDH ≥2 times the ULN, and have had their last 
transfusion within 12 months prior to screening. Subjects who had received prior eculizumab treatment 
were excluded from the study. 
Efficacy results: 
Six subjects discontinued from the study: 3 subjects withdrew consent for reasons not related to safety, 
2 subjects discontinued because of an AE, and 1 subject discontinued because of physician decision. 
Table 36: Overall Subject Disposition—Screened Set 
Treatment  with  270  mg/day  pegcetacoplan  resulted  in  improvements  in  hematologic  parameters. 
Change from baseline in mean Hb was 3.68 g/L at Day 365. Change from baseline in mean haptoglobin 
was 0.066 g/L at Day 365. 
Change from baseline in mean LDH was −2105.2 U/L at Day 365. Change from baseline in mean total 
bilirubin was −29.9 μmol/L at Day 365. 
Change from baseline in mean ARC was −105.9 × 109 cells/L at Day 365. 
Two  of  the  3  subjects  in Cohort  1  and 13  of  the  20  subjects  in  Cohort  2 did  not  require  transfusions 
during  the  pegcetacoplan  dosing  period.  Three  additional  subjects  (1  in  Cohort  1  and  2  in  Cohort  2) 
received  their  only  dosing-period  transfusion  prior  to  pegcetacoplan  reaching  a  steady-state 
concentration (Days 2, 3, and 15). Transfusion in the other 5 subjects in Cohort 2 were associated with 
SAEs. 
Change  from  baseline  in  mean  FACIT-Fatigue  score  was  7.1  points  at  Day  365.  An  increase  in  mean 
FACIT-Fatigue score of ≥3 points is generally accepted as clinically meaningful. 
In conclusion, these efficacy data should be considered as descriptive data as this phase 1b was an open-
label and multiple ascending dose. Among these subjects who had not already received eculizumab, 2 
subjects received pegcetacoplan at 180 mg daily dose and 13 received pegcetacoplan at 270 mg daily 
dose. Preliminary efficacy data showed efficacy in these patients (increase of CFB in mean Hb, reduction 
in  hemolysis  (reduction  in  LDH  and  total  bilirubin),  reduction  of  CFB  in  mean  ARC,  increase  in  mean 
FACIT-Fatigue score.  
APL-CP0514 study 
A  phase  1  open-label,  single  and  multiple  ascending  dose  study  to  assess  the  safety, 
tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of APL-2 as an add-on to standard of 
care in subjects with PNH 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/629737/2021  
Page 95/150 
 
 
 
 
 
Methodology:  
Only  efficacy  exploratory  endpoints  were  assessed  as  dependence  of  transfusion  and  FACIT-Fatigue 
score. 
Four cohorts of 12 subjects overall (9 unique subjects) with PNH who were still anemic during treatment 
with eculizumab (Soliris®) were evaluated. SC administration of APL-2 was evaluated in a single-dose 
phase and multiple-dose phase in Cohorts 1 and 2 (2 subjects each) and in multiple-dose phase only in 
Cohorts 3 (2 subjects) and 4 (6 subjects). Subjects could participate in more than 1 cohort. 
The 4 cohorts were treated as follows: 
- Cohort 1: Single SC dose of 25 mg APL-2 on Day 1, then, following a waiting period of at least 28 days, 
daily 5-mg SC dose of APL-2 for 28 days. 
- Cohort 2: Single SC dose of 50 mg APL-2 on Day 1, then, following a waiting period of at least 28 days, 
daily 30-mg SC dose of APL-2 for 28 days. 
- Cohort 3: Daily 180-mg SC dose of APL-2 for 28 days. 
- Cohort 4: Daily SC dose of 270 mg APL-2 for up to 729 days with optional intrasubject escalation up 
to 360 mg/day after Day 28. 
Main Criteria for Inclusion: Subjects were at least 18 years old. Subjects had to be diagnosed with PNH, 
on treatment with eculizumab for at least 3 months, and hemoglobin < 10 g/dL at Screening OR have 
received at least 1 transfusion within 12 months prior to Screening.  
Efficacy results: 
FACIT  score  increased  for  all  subjects  in  Cohort  3  and  Cohort  4,  except  the  subject  in  Cohort  4  who 
already had a high value at baseline. In general, FACIT Fatigue Total Score among Cohort 4 subjects 
increased from baseline and levels were maintained over the course of the study. At the end of the study 
(Week 105), Cohort 4 subjects had a mean CFB of +9.0 (range 1 to 18). 
Only 1 subject in Cohort 4 had a transfusion while receiving APL-2. Across the cohorts transfusions were 
mainly  either  before  APL-2  had  reached  steady  state,  during  dosing  interruptions,  or  following 
discontinuation of study treatment. 
Data were based on only 9 subjects as the study was closed for enrolment. No conclusion could be drawn 
based on these data. 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Clinical development programme for pegcetacoplan in patients with PNH includes 6 clinical studies. Two 
of those studies are ongoing and not submitted within this MAA. Out of the 4 remaining clinical studies, 
3 are designated as supportive and 1 is designated pivotal. The supportive studies are Study APL2-CP-
PNH-204 (Study 204; Paddock), Study APL2-202 (Study 202; Palomino) and Study APL-CP0514 (Study 
CP0514; Pharoah). Those 3 studies are early-phase (204: Phase 1b; 202: Phase 2a; CP0514: Phase 
1b), uncontrolled, with a very limited sample size of different PNH populations included (Study 204: 20 
C5i-naïve subjects; Study 202: 4 C5i-naïve subjects; Study CP0514: 6 C5i-treated subjects). 
Therefore, the impact of supportive studies on this application is limited.  
Supportive studies did not include the same pegcetacoplan dosing regimen as the pivotal Study APL2-
302, although adequate systemic exposure to pegcetacoplan was reached with the dosing used (270 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/629737/2021  
Page 96/150 
 
 
 
mg/d up to 360 mg/d). Dosing regimen used in the pivotal trial (1080 mg twice weekly) was chosen 
based on these supportive studies and PK modelling.  
Study design (main study) 
Study APL2-302 is considered the pivotal study to provide the evidence of efficacy and safety. This study 
is  a  global,  Phase  3,  prospective,  randomized,  multicenter,  open-label,  active  comparator  controlled 
study. Its objective is to confirm treatment efficacy and safety of pegcetacoplan monotherapy for the 
treatment of PNH in subjects aged ≥18 years who were receiving eculizumab therapy but continued to 
have Hb levels <10.5 g/dL. Subjects were randomized to receive pegcetacoplan 1080 mg twice weekly 
or  every  3  days  if  clinically  indicated  or  their  current  dosage  of  eculizumab.  This  head-to-head 
comparator trial was designed to demonstrate superiority of pegcetacoplan to eculizumab monotherapy 
in subjects with PNH currently on treatment with eculizumab as measured by change in Hb level at Week 
16.  After  completion  of  the  RCP  (the  end  of  Week  16),  subjects  continue  into  a  32-week  open-label 
pegcetacoplan period in which all subjects receive twice-weekly doses of pegcetacoplan 1080 mg. The 
16-week RCP is completed; the 32-week open-label period is ongoing. The clinical study report (CSR) 
covers data through the 16-week RCP.  
In total, 80 subjects were randomised (1:1) to either pegcetacoplan or eculizumab. Randomisation was 
stratified (per Protocol Amendment 3 Version 1.0) according to number of PRBC transfusion events within 
12 months prior to Day -28 (<4; ≥4) and according to platelet count (<100,000; ≥100,000). Since the 
initial stratification factor of transfusion history was significantly different (it was based on the number 
of units of PRBC transfused as opposed to the number of events of transfusion that was introduced with 
the  Protocol  Amendment),  the  Applicant  was  requested  to  discuss  the  impact  of  these  changes.  A 
discussion  on  the  rationale  for  a  change  and  possible  impact  has  been  provided.  According  to  the 
Applicant, introduced protocol amendments did not significantly impact study results and conclusions. 
Different eligibility criteria were changed in order to reflect emerging PK data or to better capture the 
effectiveness  of  pegcetacoplan.  Key  secondary  outcome  (transfusion  avoidance)  was  introduced  and 
other secondary and tertiary outcomes were rearranged; data were analysed according to amended SAP.  
Another  issue  from  the  Protocol  Assistance  that  was  not  adhered  to  is  a  strong  recommendation  to 
randomise  before  run-in  and  not  afterwards,  as  a  pre-selection  (e.g.,  depending  on  APL-2  tolerance 
and/or  early  efficacy)  can  otherwise  not  be  excluded.  A  relevant  discussion  on  the  time-point  for 
randomisation has been provided by the Applicant. It is acknowledged that the Applicant has thought 
through this issue, and that neither time-point for randomisation is flawless. From the CHMP’s point of 
view,  randomisation  after  run-in  period  raises  concerns  about  possible  selection  bias.  However,  no 
subject discontinued during the run-in period, and that the length of run-in period matches time to reach 
therapeutic concentrations of pegcetacoplan. 
As 
raised 
in 
the  protocol 
assistance 
on  6  November  2017 
by 
the  Applicant 
(EMEA/H/SA/3633/1/FU/1/2017/PA/SME/II), assessing the response to therapy at 16 weeks might not 
be sufficient to establish a benefit risk balance long-term, particularly given the long life span of red cells 
(approximately 12-16 weeks). It was noted that the treatment effect on the primary endpoint is quite 
clear at 16-weeks; however, there was a need to obtain long-term effect data of pegcetacoplan. As part 
of the responses to the LoQ, the applicant submitted efficacy and safety data from the Study APL2-302 
OLP from Week 17 through Week 48 + follow-up with a data cut-off date of 23 September 2020.  
Population 
Study APL2-302 included adult PNH patients currently being treated with eculizumab (having a stable 
dose of eculizumab for at least 3 months) but who continued to be anaemic (haemoglobin level <10.5 
g/dL at screening) despite receiving eculizumab. Therefore, the pivotal trial examined pegcetacoplan as 
a second-line treatment.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/629737/2021  
Page 97/150 
 
 
 
Some  imbalances  were  observed  between  pegcetacopan  and  eculizumab  groups  regarding  baseline 
clinical  characteristics  -  fewer  subjects  in  pegcetacoplan  vs  eculizumab  arm  were  on  label  dose  of 
eculizumab at baseline (63.4% and 76.9%). More participants in eculizumab group had ≥4 transfusion 
in  the last 12  months  compared  to  pegcetacoplan (59%  compared to 51.2%).  Mean  LDH  levels  were 
higher  in  the  eculizumab  group  compared  to  pegcetacoplan  (309  compared  to  257,  respectively). 
Haptoglobin levels were more profoundly reduced in eculizumab group (0.125 compared to 0.144 in the 
pegcetacoplan group). Some of these imbalances suggest that patients in eculizumab group might have 
less controlled disease. 
Treatments 
During  the  RCP,  patients  were  receiving  either  pegcetacoplan  1080  mg  twice  weekly  or  their  current 
dose of eculizumab. Pegcetacoplan is administered subcutaneously and this could be done by the patients 
themselves (or a caregiver), while eculizumab is administered intravenously by a healthcare provider.  
During the RCP, dose of pegcetacoplan could be adjusted (from 1080 mg twice weekly to 1080 mg every 
third day) if LDH during pegcetacoplan monotherapy was >2 × ULN. The Applicant provided an extended 
analysis as a justification for dose adjustments.  
Endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline (CFB) to Week 16, excluding data before the 
randomized  controlled  period  (RCP),  in  hemoglobin  (Hb)  level.  Key  secondary  endpoints  were: 
transfusion avoidance, CFB in absolute reticulocyte count (ARC), CFB in LDH and CFB in FACIT-Fatigue 
Scale score. A number of other secondary efficacy endpoints were pre-specified. 
From  a  clinical  standpoint,  transfusion  avoidance is  a  crucially  important  endpoint.  This  outcome  was 
also used as an endpoint in other PNH studies. Different approaches to transfusion in different centres 
were harmonised by using a pre-specified protocol criteria describing when to give a transfusion (if Hb 
value is <7 g/dL without symptoms or <9 g/dL with symptoms). 
Overall, the endpoints are clinically relevant and appropriate for the study. 
Statistical Plan 
Superiority  of  pegcetacoplan  over  eculizumab  was  examined  for the  primary  outcome.  Non-inferiority 
was  used  to  compare  results  for  the  key  secondary  outcomes,  while  superiority  was  used  for  other 
secondary outcomes. Key secondary outcomes were tested in a hierarchical manner, with formal testing 
stopping after a non-significant result was observed. 
Efficacy analyses were performed using the ITT as the primary efficacy population. Since the ITT and PP 
populations  are  equally  important  in  analysing  non-inferiority  trials,  analyses  of  the  key  secondary 
outcomes on the PP population are of high importance.  
Transfusions were intercurrent events (ICE) in Study 302. When a subject had a transfusion during the 
RCP, their data collected after the transfusion were excluded (i.e. set to missing) from the calculation 
for all efficacy endpoints and measurements up to the level of transfusion were included in analyses, 
representing a while-on-treatment strategy. The Applicant presented time-to-transfusion data including 
Kaplan-Meier plots as requested. There was a marked difference in time to transfusion in the eculizumab 
group vs pegcetacoplan group that has to be taken into consideration when interpreting study results. 
Time to discontinuation did not reveal significant difference between the study groups. 
The  between-treatment-group  comparison  for  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  performed  using  a 
mixed-effect  model  for  repeated  measures  (MMRM)  (Mallinckrodt  et  al.  2008).  The  primary  analysis 
model relies on the assumption of Missingness At Random (MAR). Mixed model approach is likely a more 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/629737/2021  
Page 98/150 
 
 
 
reliable  method  for  the  estimation  of  primary  endpoint  as  opposed  to  simple  statistical  imputation 
methods, therefore this type of analysis for the primary outcome is suitable. 
The use of a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) in the primary analysis is consistent with the 
while-on-treatment estimand strategy chosen by the Applicant. All Hb level available until intercurrent 
events (transfusion, treatment discontinuation and withdrawal) or week 16 have been used to calculating 
the  change  from  baseline  in  patients,  therefore,  no  missing  data  has  been  imputed  in  the  primary 
analysis. 
Two sensitivity analyses for the primary outcome are planned as a ‘departure from the MAR assumption 
towards the Missingness Not At Random (MNAR) assumption’– Controlled-Based Pattern Imputation and 
a  Tipping  point  analysis.  These  sensitivity  analyses  are  endorsed.  However,  additional  sensitivity 
analyses  to  investigate  different  MNAR  scenarios  are  warranted  as  per  Guideline  on  Missing  data  in 
confirmatory  clinical  trials  (EMA/CPMP/EWP/1776/99  Rev.  1).  Additional  sensitivity  analyses  to 
investigate different MNAR scenarios were done as requested. It is agreed that analyses under different 
assumptions and utilising different methods for handling missingness led to similar conclusions. 
Due  to  the  favorable  outcomes  observed  on  these  key  endpoints,  the  absence  of  clinically  relevant 
information on these margins is not an issue. 
Conduct 
The numbers of subjects in the run-in set, ITT set, mITT set, and safety set are identical. Numbers of 
patient’s withdrawals are well-balanced in both arms. No treatment allocation errors occurred in the trial. 
Reasons for protocol amendments are well described and may not impact efficacy endpoints. High rates 
of protocol deviations were observed in both arms (97.6 vs. 97.4%). Most major protocol deviations (45 
subjects;  56.3%)  involved  study  assessments/schedule  noncompliance.  Reasons  for  these  deviations 
included missed timing for laboratory or vital signs collection, missed visits, missed vaccinations, and 
assessments not completed by the subject. 
Of  particular  importance  are  major  protocol  deviations  regarding  nonadherence  to  protocol-specified 
criteria for PRBC transfusion since all of them occurred in eculizumab arm. The Applicant has clarified 
that two participants in eculizumab group received transfusion despite not meeting the protocol-specified 
criteria,  and  the  third  participant  did  not  receive  transfusion  despite  meeting  the  criteria  for  it.  The 
Applicant reassessed all protocol deviations during the end-of-study APL2-302 activities and identified 
additional  case  of  receiving  transfusion  despite  not meeting  the  protocol-specified  criteria.  In  total,  3 
participants in eculizumab group received transfusion despite not meeting the criteria, two of which were 
excluded from the PP set of 16-week CSR. Those 3 cases were classified as a major protocol deviations. 
The  fact  that  3  patients  in  eculizumab  arm  received  a  transfusion  despite  their  pretransfusion 
haemoglobin levels being >9.0 g/dL is troublesome. Subject 01009002 received the transfusion on Study 
Day  106  of  the  RCP,  which  is  near  the  end  of  the  RCP  period,  while  Subject  06001006  received  the 
transfusion on Study Day -53, which is during screening. Therefore, it can be agreed that the impact of 
these occurrences on study results is limited. The newly recognized patient to receive the transfusion 
despite not meeting criteria (Subject 04001007) received it early on during the RCP, on Day 24, which 
might influence the study results. The Applicant provided additional sensitivity analysis excluding this 
patient form the PP set and the results are in line with the primary results. 
The Applicant did a re-categorisation of protocol deviations in Dec 2020 as an end-of-study activity (it 
was  identified  that  the  implementation  of  study-specific  Protocol  deviation  guidance  document  had 
resulted in operational non-compliance deviations being categorized as major, despite not meeting the 
definition of significantly impacting subject safety and/or data integrity). It can be agreed that most of 
those  deviations  would  not  have  significant  impact  on  the  study  results  and  overall  interpretation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/629737/2021  
Page 99/150 
 
 
 
Nevertheless, it remains unfortunate to re-categorise protocol deviations after database lock date, as it 
raises concerns on the overall internal validity. 
A GCP non-compliant site from the US that enrolled 2 patients was closed, but the patients were included 
in the ITT analysis. The Applicant provided requested details. The 2 participants’ inclusion in the ITT set 
is  questionable,  but  it  can  be  considered  justified.  Sensitivity  analysis  provides  confirmation  of 
consistency with a main analysis.  
Compliance  with  study  treatments  was  high  in  both  treatment  arms  throughout  the  run-in  and  the 
randomised period which is important considering the small sample size. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The study enrolled 80 subjects. The numbers of subjects in the run-in set, ITT set, mITT set, and safety 
set are nearly identical (n=41 for pegcetacoplan arm and n=39 for eculizumab arm). 36 in pegcetacoplan 
arm and 35 patients in eculizumab arm were included in PP set. 
Treatment groups were globally balanced with regards to age, sex, height, weight, ethnicity, and race. 
Mean age was 50.2 years in pegcetacoplan arm vs. 47.3 years in eculizumab arm. Elderly subjects (65 
years and older) were included; however, experience with pegcetacoplan in Study APL2-302 in elderly 
subjects >65 years is limited to 17 subjects (21.3%). 
There  were  more  subjects  in  the  eculizumab  group  (30.8%)  from  the  APAC  region  (Australia,  Japan, 
Russia, and South Korea) than in the pegcetacoplan group (14.6%). The EU region (Belgium, France, 
Germany, United Kingdom, and Spain) had more subjects in the pegcetacoplan group (61%) than in the 
eculizumab group (48.7%). The primary and key secondary endpoints analyses have been provided for 
the 3 following geographical regions investigated in the trial: APAC, EU and NA as requested. 
Slightly less than one-third of subjects had a prior history of at least 1 type of thrombosis, including 15 
subjects  (36.6%)  in  the  pegcetacoplan  group  and  10  subjects  (25.6%)  in  the  eculizumab  group.  The 
mean time since diagnosis of PNH to Day –28 was 10.18 years overall and was longer in the eculizumab 
group than in the pegcetacoplan group (11.68 years vs 8.74 years). The duration of prior eculizumab 
treatment was numerically similar between the 2 groups (1868.3 days vs. 1745.9 days). 
The most common eculizumab dosing level and regimen was 900 mg every 2 weeks (70% of subjects), 
which is consistent with the approved product label. The remaining subjects were receiving higher than 
the label dose of eculizumab, or more frequent administration than the label specified. Specifically, 21 
subjects (26.3%) were receiving 1200 mg every 2 weeks, 2 subjects (2.5%) were receiving 1500 mg 
every 2 weeks, and 1 subject (1.3%) was receiving 900 mg once every 11 days. Fewer subjects in the 
pegcetacoplan  group  than  in  the  eculizumab  group  were  on  the  label  dose  of  eculizumab  at  baseline 
(63.4% and 76.9%). The 2 subjects who were taking the highest eculizumab dose at baseline (1500 mg 
twice weekly) were in the pegcetacoplan group. 
Baseline mean Hb, platelet, ARC, haptoglobin, total bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, and FACIT-Fatigue score 
were  generally  similar  between  groups.  LDH  was  slightly  higher  in  the  eculizumab  group  than  in  the 
pegcetacoplan group (308.64 vs 257.48, respectively). The mean number of transfusions in the last 12 
months prior to Day –28 was similar between the 2 treatment groups. Overall, 55% of subjects had ≥ 4 
PBRC transfusions in the year prior to Day-28. Slightly more subjects in the eculizumab group (59%) 
reported ≥ 4 PBRC transfusions than in the pegcetacoplan group (51.2%).  
Mean  compliance  during  RCP  for  subjects  receiving  eculizumab  was  100%,  and  99.94%  for  subjects 
receiving pegcetacoplan. During the RCP, there were only two subjects who increased dosing to every 3 
days. The Applicant provided additional data from 13 patients experiencing dose escalation within OLP.

Dose increase for patients experiencing low pegcetacoplan levels around haemolysis during treatment 
with pegcetacoplan twice weekly is considered justified. 
With the MMRM analysis, the least-square (LS) mean CFB in Hb at Week 16 in the pegcetacoplan and 
eculizumab groups was 2.37 g/dL and -1.47 g/dL, respectively. The difference in LS mean CFB in Hb 
between the 2 groups of 3.84 g/dL was statistically significant (95% CI 2.33, 5.34; P<.0001) and higher 
than the pre-specified difference between pegcetacoplan and eculizumab of 1 g/dl. The primary endpoint 
has been reached in this superiority trial. A large number of subjects received transfusions in eculizumab 
arm (n=33) compared to pegcetacoplan arm (n=5). These data reflect a superiority of pegcetacoplan 
compared  to  eculizumab  in  terms  of  efficacy  of  control  of  the  disease.  The  Applicant  has  provided 
additional  sensitivity  analyses  of  primary  efficacy  endpoint  (based  on  imputation  methods)  and 
supportive analyses of primary efficacy endpoint data with all available data (uncensored for transfusion) 
which confirm this primary analysis. 
Regarding the key secondary endpoint, pegcetacoplan met noninferiority to eculizumab on transfusion 
avoidance,  with  85.4%  of  pegcetacoplan  subjects  and  15.4%  of  eculizumab  subjects  achieving 
transfusion  avoidance  (nominal  P  value  <.0001).  This  result  is  significantly  clinically  relevant.  The 
proportion of subjects who were transfusion avoidant was similar in the pegcetacoplan group, regardless 
of  baseline  PRBC  transfusion  strata  or  baseline  platelet  strata,  but  not  in  the  eculizumab  group. 
Pegcetacoplan  was  also  non-inferior  to  eculizumab  for  CFB  in  ARC,  a  marker  of  hematopoietic  bone 
marrow compensatory activity in the setting of anemia and/or hemolysis, with an LS mean difference of 
–163.6 × 109 cells/L (nominal P value <.0001). LDH did not meet non-inferiority by the prespecified 
analysis. However, a greater percentage of subjects on pegcetacoplan achieved LDH normalization, as 
compared with eculizumab (71% vs 15%, respectively). Noninferiority for the FACIT-Fatigue score was 
not assessed because of the prespecified hierarchical testing. Of note, a higher numerical improvements 
were seen in FACIT-Fatigue score in the pegcetacoplan group as compared with the eculizumab group 
with a difference of 11.87 points (95% CI 5.49, 18.25; nominal P value .0005).  
As part of the responses to the LoQ, the applicant submitted efficacy and safety data from the Study 
APL2-302 OLP from Week 17 through Week 48 + follow-up with a data cut-off date of 23 September 
2020. All subjects had completed the Week 48 visit and had either entered follow-up or the extension 
study, Study APL2-307.  
Data cut-off was set to 23 September 2020. This data cut includes 77 subjects who entered the open-
label  period  (OLP)  and  67  (87%)  subjects  who  completed  the  Week  48  visit.  Ten  subjects  (13.0%) 
discontinued from study treatment.  
Results from OLP constitute additional data for long-term treatment efficacy after 16 weeks. Results of 
the key efficacy analyses of the OLP confirmed the results observed during the 16-week RCP.  
Results suggest an improvement in PNH markers and fatigue and efficacy results were comparable to 
that observed for the pegcetacoplan continuation group when pegcetacoplan was added to eculizumab 
for subjects previously treated with eculizumab monotherapy after Week 16.  
Improvements in FACIT-Fatigue score were confirmed through Week 48 with 55% of subjects improved 
FACIT-Fatigue score by ≥3 points. The PK analysis within OLP also showed that therapeutic concentrations 
of pegcetacoplan were maintained for up to Week 48.  
Open-label design for a single pivotal study is considered a drawback, hence a double-dummy design 
was  proposed  in  the  Protocol  Assistance  (EMEA/H/SA/3633/1/FU/1/2017/PA/SME/II).  The  Applicant 
provided relevant discussion on exclusion of a double-dummy design, and it is acknowledged. However, 
the  Applicant  did  not  provide  an  assessment  of  the  risk  of  bias  in  the  single  pivotal  clinical  trial  as 
requested. Specific measures of minimisation of bias are outlined. It is considered that measures used 
to minimise the risk of bias preserved internal validity sufficiently.

A  short  discussion  regarding  the  impact  of  investigators  interventions  and  primary  and  secondary 
endpoints measurements’ conditions has been provided. The applicant clarified that laboratory measures 
were conducted in the central laboratory and treatment assignment information was not communicated 
to this latter. The need of transfusions and the classification of patients as responders/non responders 
was done following objective lab tests criteria regardless of investigator opinion.  
At the time of planning Study 302, eculizumab was the only approved therapy for PNH. Since July 2019 
another C5 inhibitor (ravulizumab) is approved for the treatment of patients with PNH. Since eculizumab 
and ravulizumab share the same mechanism of action, it is acceptable to view the comparator in this 
study (eculizumab) as representing both available C5 inhibitors.  
It is noted that TA was achieved in a very low number and percentage of subjects in the eculizumab arm 
(only 6 out of 39 patients, amounting to 15.4%). This seems to be an under-performace of eculizumab, 
since transfusion  avoidance  was  reached in 51% of patients treated  with eculizumab  in  the  TRIUMPH 
and SHEPHERD trials (Soliris SmPC) and in 66.1% of eculizumab-treated patients in a recent study with 
ravulizumab (Lee et al., 2019). The Applicant provided relevant discussion and justification for apparent 
underperformance of eculizumab arm in the pivotal trial APL2-302. It is agreed that underperformance 
of eculizumab cannot easily be concluded because patient populations in the pegcetacoplan, eculizumab 
and ravulizumab pivotal trials were different. Some literature references provided are of limited value 
due to a small sample sizes but are supportive of conclusions.  
The Applicant provided an extended analysis as a justification for dose adjustments. Data were collected 
in  15  patients  in  total,  from  whom  13  were  enrolled  in  OLP.  Escalation  was  decided  after  patients 
experiencing haemolytic events, elevated LDH value and a low pegcetacoplan concentration at the time 
of  haemolysis  under  Pegcetacoplan  twice  weekly.  No  eculizumab  dose  adjustments  was  recorded 
however variations from the planned eculizumab dosing schedule have been reported with no associated 
haemolytic events or clinical impact.  
Of  the  15  patients,  8  (53.3%)  have  demonstrate  benefit  from  Q3D  dosing,  4  (26.7%)  did  not 
demonstrate benefit and 3 (20%), were not assessable because of limited Q3D treatment duration (<30 
days).  Based  on  data  provided,  it  is  endorsed  that  dose  increase  should  be  an  option  for  patients 
experiencing  low  pegcetacoplan  levels  around  haemolysis  during  treatment  with  pegcetacoplan  twice 
weekly. 
Improved  outcomes  with  pegcetacoplan  treatment,  as  compared  with  eculizumab  treatment,  were 
observed in others secondary endpoints at Week 16. Higher percentage of subjects in the pegcetacoplan 
group, as compared with the eculizumab group, achieving Hb response (75.6 % vs 0%), Hb normalization 
(34.1% vs 0%), and ARC normalization (78% vs 2.6%). Subjects in the pegcetacoplan group required 
fewer units of PRBCs to be transfused. The mean number of PRBC units required in the pegcetacoplan 
group was 0.6 and in the eculizumab group was 5.1 (95% CI: 2.0, 4.0). Indirect bilirubin levels decreased 
with pegcetacoplan treatment, but not with eculizumab treatment. LASA and QLQ-C30 scores increased 
in pegcetacoplan arm but not in eculizumab arm.  An exception is noted with haptoglobin, which showed 
a further decrease (-0.02 g/L) in the pegcetacoplan group and an increase (0.12 g/L) in the eculizumab 
group from baseline to Week 16. In both groups the observed values of haptoglobin were below the LLN 
at week 16, with values in eculizumab group being closer to the LLN than values in pegcetacoplan group. 
The Applicant provided relevant discussion and possible explanation for observed differences in CFB in 
haptoglobin values between study groups, which is acknowledged. It seems that there was a number of 
censored observations in the eculizumab group. 
When all observed data were considered (no censoring of data due to PRBC transfusion), the results of 
all  primary  and  key  secondary  analyses  were  consistent  with  the  MMRM  analyses  in  which  post-
transfusion  data  were  set  to  missing.  This  is  reassuring;  however  for  full  interpretation  the  Applicant 
provided requested information regarding the amount of missing and imputed data in the uncensored 
Assessment report

Page 102/150 
 
 
 
analysis  information.  MMRM  uncensored  analysis  included  subject  with  missing  data,  with  no  formal 
imputation. There was a notable difference in missing data between study groups. Despite the difference, 
the Applicant is claiming consistency of all obtained results. As stated in the initial assessment, this is 
an important analysis bearing in mind the large amount of censoring in the primary analysis, especially 
in eculizumab arm. Considering provided information on the missing data, the supportive analysis 1 of 
CFB  in  Hb  levels  at  Week  16  (uncensored  for  transfusion)  is  found  to  be  supportive,  although  the 
magnitude of observed benefit with pegcetacoplan compared to eculizumab is smaller than in the primary 
analysis, as already pointed out in the initial assessment.  
Two sensitivity analyses for the primary outcome were performed. The first sensitivity analysis is the 
control-based  pattern  imputation  (CBPI)  censored  for  transfusion.  In  this  analysis,  it  is  assumed  that 
participants  who  discontinue  (in  either  group)  will  have  unobserved  outcomes  similar  to  subjects  in 
eculizumab arm (for details please see Main study assessment in clinical AR). In this analysis, LS mean 
difference in CFB in Hg (pegcetacoplan – eculizumab) was 2.60 g/dL (95% CI 1.59, 3.61; p<0.0001). 
The effect size is very similar to analysis with uncensored values, and smaller than the results of the 
primary analysis although still statistically significant and clinically relevant. 
The second sensitivity analysis was the tipping point analysis, which shows that the true tipping point 
for LS mean difference in CFB in Hb (pegcetacoplan – eculizumab) is between 1.46 and 1.57 g/dL. This 
is quite below the effect size obtained with the primary analysis. However, this analysis also used data 
censored for transfusion. 
The Applicant also provided CBPI and tipping point analyses while using all available data (no censoring 
for  transfusion).  These  results  are  similar  to  when  censored  data  are  used.  Therefore,  the  sensitivity 
analyses  are  supportive  of  the  primary  analysis  of  the  primary  efficacy  outcome  demonstrating 
superiority of pegcetacoplan over eculizumab. 
The 5 supportive analyses (using uncensored data; mITT; PP; completers; nonparametric ANCOVA) were 
in line with the primary analysis.  
Subgroup analyses according to gender and race show some differences across subgroups. Females in 
pegcetacoplan arm (23 evaluated) show a mean CFB in Hb of 2.44 g/dL while males in pegcetacoplan 
arm (13 evaluated) show a mean CFB in Hb of 3.42 g/dL. Such a difference is not observed in eculizumab 
arm. The Applicant provided discussion on the possible impact of gender and is claiming that apparent 
difference in haemoglobin CFB in men and women may by driven by the difference in haemoglobin LLN 
between sexes rather than by a difference in response to pegcetacoplan. Indeed, gender did not have 
clinically relevant effect on the pegcetacoplan PK based on the results of the popPK analysis (please refer 
to  the  initial  PK  assessment).  Provided  discussion  might  be  plausible.  Of  note,  number  of  subjects  in 
eculizumab group analysed at Week 16 was too small for conclusions (female N=4, male N=2). 
Subgroup analyses by race showed that the greatest mean CFB in Hb at Week 16 in the pegcetacoplan 
group was seen in White subjects. Asian and Black/African American subjects in the pegcetacoplan group 
had a mean CFB that was approximately 1 g/dL lower than for White subjects. By age, subjects in the 
pegcetacoplan group were comparable in mean CFB at Week 16. Meaningful subgroup comparisons were 
not possible for the eculizumab arm given the large number of subjects who were removed from the 
analysis because of transfusions.  
Breakthrough  haemolysis  was  analysed  post-hoc  and  is  of  exploratory  value,  but  of  great  clinical 
relevance.  Signs  of  breakthrough  haemolysis  while  LDH  elevated  (after  prior  reduction  of  LDH)  was 
observed in 2 subjects (4.9%) in pegcetacoplan and 13 subjects (33.3%) in eculizumab arm. However, 
according  to  available  literature  data,  eculizumab  underperformed  in  this  pivotal  trial.  According  to 
literature,  the  incidence  of  breakthrough  haemolysis  with  eculizumab  is  up  to 27%,  while  in  a  recent 
pivotal study of ravulizumab it was as low as 5% (Kulasekararaj et al., 2019). In the present study, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/629737/2021  
Page 103/150 
 
 
 
incidence  of  breakthrough  haemolysis  with  eculizumab  is  33.3%,  which  is  significantly  higher  than  in 
literature studies. Underperformance of the eculizumab was already commented regarding transfusion 
avoidance.  
Finally, as mentioned in the protocol, self-administration of pegcetacoplan is permitted in section 4.2 of 
the SmPC. However, the risk of severe hypersensitivity reaction (including anaphylaxis) is identified as 
an important potential risk with this product. Thus, the patients eligible to self-administration in whom 
this risk can be avoided are identified in section 4.2 of the SmPC: “Self administration and home infusion 
should be considered for patients who have tolerated treatment well in experienced treatment centres. 
The decision of a possibility of self administration and home infusions should be made after evaluation 
and  recommendation  from  the  treating  physician.”  Guidance  is  also  available  as  part  of  the  patient 
information pack (see RMP section). 
Supportive clinical studies have been provided by the Applicant but not in the target population or in the 
claimed posology. 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Study APL2-302 is a randomized, controlled, global Phase 3 trial designed to compare the clinical efficacy 
of pegcetacoplan with a representative C5 inhibitor, eculizumab. The primary endpoint (CFB in Hb level) 
has been reached in this superiority trial. The following key secondary endpoints: transfusion avoidance, 
CFB  in  ARC  level  and  CFB  in  FACIT-Fatigue  score  were  consistent  with  the  primary  analysis.  Key 
secondary endpoints were tested first for non-inferiority and, if all were met, then superiority was tested 
sequentially  for  transfusion  avoidance,  ARC,  LDH,  and  FACIT-Fatigue  score  using  a  closed-testing 
procedure at a significance level of 0.05. CFB in LDH level did not meet non-inferiority by the prespecified 
analysis. However, a greater percentage of subjects on pegcetacoplan achieved LDH normalization, as 
compared with eculizumab. 
When  all  available  data  are  used,  results  are  in  line  with  the  primary  analyses  but  the  magnitude  of 
benefit observed with pegcetacoplan compared to eculizumab is smaller, albeit still statistically significant 
and clinically relevant. 
The  proposed  indication  as  amended  is  in  line  with  the  studied  population  and  reflects  second-line 
treatment, in patients still anaemic despite being treated with a C5 inhibitor. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
The  safety  data  for  pegcetacoplan  in  subjects  with  paroxysmal  nocturnal  hemoglobinuria  (PNH)  via 
subcutaneous (SC) infusion are taken from 6 studies in adults. Of these, 3 studies are completed (Study 
APL2-202 (Study 202), Study APL2-CP-PNH-204 (Study 204) and Study APL-CP0514 (Study CP0514)) 
and 2 studies are ongoing (study 307 and study 308). For the pivotal Study APL2-302, the randomized 
control period (RCP) is completed whereas the open-label phase is ongoing. 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
Through the data cut-off date (31 May 2020), the safety database consisted of 110 patients with PNH 
who received SC pegcetacoplan in the 4 studies submitted. Of the total safety database, 36 patients of 
115  (31.3%)  received  pegcetacoplan  for  more  than  1  year,  9  subjects  (7.8%)  for  >2  years,  and  4 
subjects  (3.5%)  for  >3  years  and  on  the  80  patients  enrolled  in  the  pivotal  study  APL2-302  only  10 
subjects (12.5%) received pedcetacoplan for >1 year, and no patient received pegcetacoplan for more 
than 2 years.

The pivotal study APL2-302 was composed by a run-in period of 28 days and by a randomized control 
period (RCP) of 16 weeks. In most subjects (n = 79), there was a period of combined pegcetacoplan and 
eculizumab exposure during the RCP, and this period is denoted as “pegcetacoplan + eculizumab”.  
During the run-in period, 80 subjects received both pegcetacoplan (at a dose of 1080 mg twice weekly 
or every 3 days) and eculizumab (at their current dosage) during this study period with a median duration 
of  treatment  of  29  days  for  both  groups.  During  the  RCP,  41  subjects  received  pegcetacoplan  for  a 
median of 110.0 days, and 39 subjects received eculizumab for a median of 99.0 days.  
All subjects started pegcetacoplan at a dosage of 1080 mg subcutaneously twice weekly in the pivotal 
study APL2-302. The protocol required dose escalation if a subject had elevated LDH levels > 2 x ULN. 
In the 3 supportive studies (Study 202, Study 204, and Study CP0514), patients received pegcetacoplan 
at a dose from 270mg/day to 360mg/day. In the study 202, all 4 subjects received 270mg pegcetacoplan 
daily for a duration of 1 year. The 20 patients of the cohort 2 of the study 204 received a starting dose 
of 270mg/day and then doses up to 360mg/day and the 6 patients of the cohort 4 of the study CP0514 
received a dose of 270mg/day.  
Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
The majority of the enrolled patients were female with 61% of female in the pivotal study and overall 
for the 4 studies, were young with a median age of 50.5 years old (min, max: 19, 81) in the pivotal 
study and 42 years old (min, max: 19, 81) overall for the 4 studies and were mostly White (53.6%) 
following by Asian except for the cohort 2 of study 204 where 75% of patients were Asian. In the pivotal 
study APL2-302, of the 80 patients enrolled 17 patients (21.3%) had more than 65 years old and among 
them 10 patients (10/41; 24.4%) were randomized in the pegcetacoplan group during the RCP.

Run-in period of the pivotal study APL2-302 
During the run-in period, 80 patients received the combination of pegcetacoplan and eculizumab. Of the 
80  patients  69  subjects  (86.3%)  experienced  at  least  1  TEAE  with  the  majority  were  of  a  maximum 
severity of mild (51 patients [63.8%]), followed by moderate for 16 patients (20.0%) and severe for 2 
patients (2.5%) (Sepsis and neutropenia). There were no TEAEs leading to death, study discontinuation, 
or study drug discontinuation during this period. 
The most common AEs were reported in the SOC general disorders and administration site conditions 
(49 subjects [61.3%]) with injection site reactions reported in 46 subjects (57.5%) including injection 
site erythema, pruritus and swelling as the most common events. However, none injection site reactions 
were severe, serious, or led to study drug discontinuation.  
AEs that were next more often reported were gastrointestinal disorders (16 subjects [20.0%]) including 
diarrhoea  (6  subjects  [7.5%])  and  nausea  (5  subjects  [6.3%])  and  nervous  system  disorders  (14 
subjects [17.5%]) with headache being the most common events (10 subjects [12.5%]). 
Infections and infestations were reported in 11 subjects (13.8%) with one was of moderate maximum 
severity (otitis externa) and one was severe (sepsis).  
More  TEAEs  were  considered  to  be  related  to  pegcetacoplan  (44/80;  55.0%)  or  to  the  infusion 
(32/80; 40%), than to eculizumab (4/80; 5.0%).  
There were no TEAEs leading to death, study discontinuation, or study drug discontinuation during the 
run-in period.

TEAEs  in  44  subjects  (55.0%)  were  deemed  to  be  related  to  pegcetacoplan.  General  disorders  and 
administration site conditions were reported as event counted as pegcetacoplan-related by 37 subjects 
(46.3%).  Injection  site  erythema  was  the  most  frequently  reported  of  these  events  (23  subjects 
[28.8%]), followed by injection site pruritus and injection site swelling (8 subjects [10% each]) but also 
injection  site  reaction,  injection  site  induration  and  injection  site  pain.  Six  subjects  (7.5%)  reported 
nervous  system  disorders,  including  headache  reported  by  4  subjects  (5%).  No  other  TEAEs  were 
reported in 5% or more of subjects in this study period. 
During the run-in period 4 subjects (5%) reported eculizumab-related TEAEs including 1 report each of 
ALT  increased,  platelet  count  decreased,  leukopenia,  neutropenia,  sepsis,  and  pain  in  jaw.  Events 
considered  related  to  both  pegcetacoplan  and  eculizumab  included  ALT  increased,  platelet  count 
decreased, leukopenia, neutropenia and sepsis. 
Randomized controlled period (RCP) of the pivotal study 
-  Pegcetacoplan + Eculizumab after randomization but before monotherapy dosing began 
During the RCP, the majority of subjects (79 of 80) started monotherapy after Day 2 to fit their dosing 
schedule. Twelve (15.2%) of these subjects (noted in the pegcetacoplan + eculizumab Group column in 
Table 44) reported at least 1 TEAE after randomization but before monotherapy dosing began. TEAEs 
reported in more than 2 subjects included fatigue and pyrexia (3 subjects each, 3.8%) and viral upper 
respiratory tract infection (URTI), viral infection, dizziness, and chromaturia (2 subjects each, 2.5%). 
The remaining TEAEs were reported by only 1 subject each. 
Twelve subjects (15.2%) who received pegcetacoplan + eculizumab experienced 27 TEAEs (19 unique 
events).  Two  of  these  were  deemed  related  to  pegcetacoplan  and  1  was  considered  related  to 
eculizumab. Eight subjects (10.1%) reported TEAEs with a maximum severity of mild; 3 subjects (3.8%) 
reported a TEAE with a maximum severity of moderate; and 1 subject reported an event with a maximum 
severity of severe. No TEAEs led to study drug discontinuation. Two subjects reported 2 unique SAEs. 
Neither SAE was deemed related to either study drug. 
-  Monotherapy 
After  the  beginning  of  the  monotherapy  during  the  RCP,  a  similar  percentage  of  subjects  in  both 
treatment  groups  reported  at  least  1  TEAE,  36  patients  (87.8%)  in  the  pegcetacoplan  group  and  34 
patients (87.2%) in the eculizumab group.

Note: A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is an adverse event that commenced on or after the time 
of first study drug administration or an adverse event with increase in severity from pretreatment. Adverse 
events were coded to system organ class and preferred term using MedDRA Version 20.0. 
If a subject has multiple occurrences of a TEAE, the subject is presented only once in the subject count (n) 
column for a given system organ class and Preferred Term. 
* TEAEs that occurred after randomization date but before the first monotherapy are summarized under the 
pegcetacoplan + eculizumag Group. 
Source: Table 14.3.1.2.2 
Sixteen subjects (39%) in the pegcetacoplan group and 7 subjects (17.9%) in the eculizumab  group 
reported  a  drug-related  TEAE,  largely  accounted  for  by  injection/infusion  site  reactions,  which  were 
reported solely in the pegcetacoplan group. Other than ISRs, there were no other drug-related TEAEs 
occurring in 5% or more of one group as compared to the other. 
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
One serious TEAE of sepsis occurred during the run-in period. This event was considered related to both 
pegcetacoplan and eculizumab. The subject recovered without discontinuation of both pegcetacoplan and 
eculizumab. The subject had no further SAEs or TEAEs of infection. 
A similar proportion of subjects in the pegcetacoplan and eculizumab groups experienced SAEs during 
the RCP: 7 subjects (17.1%) in the pegcetacoplan group experienced 8 SAEs, and 6 subjects (15.4 %) 
in the eculizumab group experienced 11 SAEs.

*  TEAEs  that  occurred  after  randomization  date  but  before  the  first  monotherapy  are  summarized  under  the 
pegcetacoplan + eculizumab Group. 
Source: Table 14.3.1.6.2 
During the RCP, one SAE (2.4%) of facial paralysis in the pegcetacoplan group was considered related 
to  pegcetacoplan,  and  one  SAE  (2.6%)  of  pyrexia  in  the  eculizumab  group  was  considered  related to 
eculizumab.  
No death occurred in the pivotal study APL2-302 before Week 16. However, a fatal SAE of COVID-19 
that was deemed not related to pegcetacoplan by the investigator was reported in the open-label phase 
(OLP) of the study APL2-302 that occurred after Week 16 (see section below with updated safety data 
from the OLP). 
Among the 3 supportive studies, no death occurred in the study 202 but 3 deaths occurred in the Study 
204  and  CP0514,  2  of  which  were  on-study  (aplastic  anaemia  in  the  cohort  2  of  the  study  204  and 
intracranial haemorrhage in the cohort 1 of the study CP0514) whereas the last one was not on study 
(abdominal  neoplasm  in  the  cohort  2  of  the  study  204)  and  none  of  which  were  deemed  related  to 
pegcetacoplan by the investigator. 
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Overall,  the  laboratory  findings  including  haematology  and  chemistry  were  consistent  with  those 
expected  in  patients  with  PNH,  and  changes  in  these  parameters  were  consistent  with  the  efficacy 
findings that pegcetacoplan improves haemolytic anaemia associated with PNH.  
2.6.8.5.  Safety in special populations 
One study in subjects with renal impairment, Study 205, has been performed. Pegcetacoplan was well 
tolerated across both the severe renal impairment and control cohorts with no major differences between 
cohorts  other  than  ongoing  TEAEs  and  concomitant  medications  reflective  of  the  underlying  medical 
condition and not pegcetacoplan treatment.  
No formal studies of pegcetacoplan in pregnant women have been performed up to the data cut-off date 
(31 May 2020), and contraception is required for women of childbearing potential participating in clinical 
studies with pegcetacoplan.  
There is no experience with pegcetacoplan in women who are breastfeeding.  
There are no reports of pegcetacoplan overdosage in clinical studies, and there is unlikely to be a  misuse 
problem with pegcetacoplan because it does not affect the central nervous system.

The Applicant has no information at this time regarding any effects of pegcetacoplan on those to whom 
it is administered related to their ability to drive or operate machinery or to any impairment of mental 
ability. The results of the nonclinical pharmacology studies do not suggest a depressive central nervous 
system effect. 
The pivotal Study APL2-302 did not include children or adolescents.

Data from studies APL2-302, 202, 204 and CP0514 
a Includes TEAEs with higher percentage of occurrence in subjects 65 years of age and older compared 
to subjects under 65 years of age. 
2.6.8.6.  Immunological events 
In the pivotal study a low incidence of anti-pegcetacoplan peptide antibody response (2 of 80 subjects 
[2.5%]) was observed whereas higher percentages of anti-PEG antibody response were detected. This 
anti-PEG antibody response is due to preexisting anti-PEG antibodies (66 of 80 subjects [82.5%]) which 
could be explained by the development of anti-PEG  antibodies after prior exposure to PEG-containing 
products including many medicines, cosmetics, and food products. However, the neutralizing antibody

analysis is ongoing and not provided in this application. In the pivotal study, the incidence of treatment-
emergent or treatment-boosted anti-PEG response was low (one for each case [1.3%]). The treatment-
boosted anti-PEG response observed was considered transient. Titer values associated with the positive 
anti-pegcetacoplan peptide antibody response, treatment-emergent anti-PEG response, and treatment-
boosted anti-PEG response were all considered low (less than 1:40).  
Overall immunogenicity are consistent across all clinical studies with infrequent and generally transient 
anti–pegcetacoplan  peptide  antibody  responses  detected  in  pegcetacoplan-treated  subjects,  a  high 
percentage  of  preexisting  anti-PEG  antibody  responses  reported  in  the  predose  samples  and  a  low 
incidences of treatment-emergent or treatment-boosted anti-PEG antibody response, with many of those 
responses that were transient.  
However, results related to immunogenicity in the pivotal Study APL2-302 are immature. 
Immunogenicity has been added as an important potential risk in the EU RMP and has been included 
as a safety concern to be monitored in the PASS 
2.6.8.7.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug or withdrawal from the study were reported  during 
the run-in period.  
During the RCP, 3 subjects (7.3%) discontinued because of TEAEs, all in the pegcetacoplan group, and 
all because of breakthrough haemolysis. 
Updated safety data from the Open-label phase portion of Study APL2-302 
Further safety data from the OLP (Open-label phase) portion of Study APL2-302 showing safety data at 
48-week (data cutoff date of 23 September 2020) was provided during the procedure.

Notes: AEs were coded to SOC and PT using MedDRA Version 23.0. 
An AE (classified by PT) that occurred during the study was considered a TEAE if it had a start date on or after the first dose of 
investigational 
product or if it had a start date before the date of the first dose but increased in severity on or after the date of the first dose. It applied 
up to 
30 days follow-up. If a subject had multiple occurrences of a TEAE, the subject was presented only once in the subject count (n)

Immunogenicity 
Of all subjects in OLP, none were confirmed positive for anti–pegcetacoplan peptide antibody at any 
time point (BAL-18-503-006). 
Three subjects (03009002, 04001001, and 10002001) were observed to develop treatment  boosted 
anti–polyethylene glycol antibody response in the LP as demonstrated by a ≥4-fold increase in titer 
from the predose level (BAL-18-503-010). 
2.6.8.8.  Post marketing experience 
Not applicable. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  data  for  pegcetacoplan  in  subjects  with  paroxysmal  nocturnal  hemoglobinuria  (PNH)  via 
subcutaneous  (SC)  infusion  are  mainly  coming  from  the  ongoing  pivotal  phase  3  study  APL2-302. 
Supportive data coming from 3 phase 1b/2a studies (study 204, study 202 and study CP0514) are also 
provided. Data pooling could not be performed. 
Through the data cut-off date (31 May 2020), the safety database consisted of 110 patients with PNH 
who  received  SC  pegcetacoplan  in  the  4  studies  submitted.  Only  41  PNH  patients  were  included  in 
pegcetacoplan randomised controlled period of phase 3 pivotal study (16 weeks) among which only 10 
subjects (12.5%) received pegcetacoplan for >1 year, and no patient received pegcetacoplan for more

than 2 years. Safety database is deemed limited in terms of number of PNH  patients exposed and in 
terms of duration of exposure. Safety data from the 32-week open-label period (OLP) of Study APL2-
302 with a data cutoff date of 23 September 2020 were also provided during the procedure giving an 
assessment  of  overall  safety  at  Week  48.  Long-term  safety  data  will  be  also  implemented  by  safety 
results from an extension study (Study APL-307) which the due date is expected for first quarter of 2026. 
However,  while  awaiting  the  results  of  this  study,  long-term  safety  has  been  added  as  missing 
information in the RMP.  
The  pivotal  study  APL2-302  was  composed  by  a  run-in  period  of  28  days,  followed  by  a  randomized 
control period (RCP) of 16 weeks and by 32-week open-label period (OLP). The OLP included a 4-week 
run-in period of cotreatment with eculizumab and pegcetacoplan for those assigned to eculizumab during 
the RCP. Subjects assigned to pegcetacoplan during the RCP remained on pegcetacoplan monotherapy 
in the OLP. 
Rigorous cardiac eligibility criteria and monitoring were implemented to discharge unanticipated cardiac 
risk. The observations derived from dedicated non-clinical studies do not suggest a relationship between 
pegcetacoplan plasma concentration and effect on QTc. Cardiac safety was assessed in the pivotal Phase 
3  study,  Study  APL2-302,  using  absolute  ECG  parameter  values,  change  from  baseline  in  ECG 
parameters, and ECG morphology assessments. To date, no evidence of a clinically relevant trend in the 
incidence of cardiovascular AEs, including QT interval prolongation, has been observed in clinical studies 
with  pegcetacoplan  in  healthy  volunteers  or  PNH  patients.  Patients  with  history  of  QT  prolongation 
syndrome  or  cardiac  history  or  those  receiving  drugs  with  the  potential  to  prolong  QT  interval  were 
excluded from Study APL2-302. However, these patients were not excluded from studies to mitigate a 
specific known or anticipated cardiac risk associated with the use of pegcetacoplan. These patients were 
excluded to minimise confounding cardiac safety outcomes and to ensure a homogeneous population for 
the QT analysis which formed part of the study.  
During the randomized control period, the median duration of treatment for the 41 subjects that received 
pegcetacoplan  was  3.6  months  (110.0  days),  and  for  the  39  subjects  that  received  eculizumab  the 
median duration of treatment was 3.3 months (99.0 days).  
Sixty-seven  subjects  (87.0%)  completed  treatment  in  the  OLP,  including  32  subjects  (82.1%)  in  the 
crossover to pegcetacoplan group (28 weeks of pegcetacoplan monotherapy) and 35 subjects (92.1%) 
in the pegcetacoplan continuation group (48 weeks of pegcetacoplan monotherapy). 
During the run-in period, 80 patients received the combination of pegcetacoplan and eculizumab. Of 
the 80 patients, 69 subjects (86.3%) experienced at least 1 TEAE. There were no TEAEs leading to death, 
study discontinuation, or study drug discontinuation during this period. 
During this period, the most common AEs were reported in the SOC general disorders and administration 
site  conditions  (49  subjects  [61.3%])  with  injection  site  reactions  reported  in  46  subjects  (57.5%) 
including  injection  site  erythema,  pruritus  and  swelling  as  the  most  common  events.  However,  none 
injection site reactions were severe, serious, or led to study drug discontinuation.  
AEs that were next more often reported were gastrointestinal disorders (16 subjects [20.0%]) including 
diarrhoea  (6  subjects  [7.5%])  and  nausea  (5  subjects  [6.3%])  and  nervous  system  disorders  (14 
subjects  [17.5%])  with  headache  being  the  most  common  events  (10  subjects  [12.5%]).  This  is  not 
unexpected since headache is the most common adverse reaction observed with eculizumab treatment 
(see SmPC). 
Infections and infestations were reported in 11 subjects (13.8%) with one was of moderate maximum 
severity (otitis externa) and one was severe (sepsis). The event of sepsis was the only one SAE reported 
during  the  run-in  period,  it  was  considered  related  to  both  pegcetacoplan  and  eculizumab  and  was

resolved without discontinuation of both drugs. The subject was later randomly assigned to pegcetacoplan 
and had no subsequent TEAEs of infection. 
More  TEAEs  were  considered  to  be  related  to  pegcetacoplan  (44/80;  55.0%)  or  to  the  infusion 
(32/80; 40%), than to eculizumab (4/80; 5.0%). As subjects were already on eculizumab at study entry, 
and pegcetacoplan was added to eculizumab treatment during the run-in period, it was not unexpected 
that more TEAEs during the run-in period would have been considered related to  pegcetacoplan than to 
eculizumab.  
During monotherapy treatment in the randomized controlled period (RCP), a similar percentage of 
subjects in both treatment groups reported at least 1 TEAE, 36 patients (87.8%) in the pegcetacoplan 
group  and  34  patients  (87.2%)  in  the  eculizumab  group.  Most  subjects  had  TEAEs  with  a  maximum 
severity of mild or moderate, in the pegcetacoplan group 19 subjects (46.3%) and 9 subjects (22.0%) 
respectively and in the eculizumab group in 14 subjects (35.9%) and 15 subjects (38.5%) respectively. 
Overall in the pegcetacoplan group there were more TEAEs in the SOCs general disorders/administration 
site conditions, musculoskeletal/connective tissue disorders and gastrointestinal (GI) disorders than in 
the eculizumab group. TEAEs in the SOC infections and infestations were equally reported in both groups 
whereas more TEAEs in the SOCs blood/lymphatic system disorders and nervous system disorders were 
reported in the eculizumab group than in the pegcetacoplan group. 
There were more TEAEs in the pegcetacoplan group than the eculizumab group: 270 TEAEs (100 unique 
events) were reported in the pegcetacoplan group whereas 135 TEAEs (73 unique events) were reported 
in the eculizumab group. However, when excluding injection site reactions TEAEs, the number of TEAEs 
becomes almost the same between both groups (142 total TEAEs [92 unique] in the pegcetacoplan group 
and 134 TEAEs [73 unique]).  
The most common TEAEs observed in the pegcetacoplan group during the RCP of the pivotal study 
APL2-302 were injections site reactions (ISR) with 15 subjects (36.6%) including injection site 
erythema (7 subjects [17.1%]) and injection site reaction (5 subjects [12.2%]), diarrhoea (9 subjects 
[22%]) and abdominal pain (5 subjects [12.2%]). All TEAEs of diarrhoea in the pegcetacoplan group 
were rated mild and did not lead to treatment discontinuation.  
Adverse events of special interest 
The Applicant highlighted AESIs injection site reactions, infections, haemolytic disorders, thrombosis, 
and hypersensitivity. 
•  During the RCP of Study APL2-302, injection site reactions were common and occurred in 
much higher percentages in pegcetacoplan group compared to eculizumab group (36.6% vs 
2.6%). After injection site erythema and injection site reaction, the most frequent of them 
were: injection site swelling, injection site induration and injection site bruising. There were no 
TEAEs of ISR that were serious, severe, or led to study drug discontinuation. Six subjects 
(17.1%) experienced ISRs during the OPL run-in period (Weeks 17-20) and 18 subjects 
(23.3%) experienced ISRs during pegcetacoplan monotherapy. No subjects discontinued 
because of an ISR and no ISRs were severe during the OLP. 
•  During Study APL2-302 RCP, SOC infections and infestations TEAEs were equally reported 
in the pegcetacoplan and eculizumab groups with 12 subjects (29.3%) and 10 subjects 
(25.6%), respectively. The wide range of observed infections were individual and no grouping 
was noted but the sample size is small. Two subjects in each treatment group reported viral 
upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) (4.9% in pegcetacoplan group and 5.1% in eculizumab 
group), and 1 subject in each group reported gastroenteritis and URTI. Two subjects (4.9%) 
reported oral herpes exclusively in the pegcetacoplan group and 2 subjects (5.1%) reported 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/629737/2021  
Page 127/150 
 
 
 
urinary tract infection exclusively in the eculizumab group. All other types of 
infections/infestations were reported in 1 subject each in pegcetacoplan group or in the 
eculizumab group.  
A total of 42 subjects (54.5%) experienced TEAEs included in the SOC of infections and 
infestations during the OLP. The frequency has almost doubled compared to the RCP. Events 
deemed related to pegcetacoplan by the investigator were limited to nasopharyngitis (1 subject 
[1.3%]) and urinary tract infection (2 subjects [2.6%]). The event of COVID-19 deemed 
unrelated to pegcetacoplan by the investigator was the only infection TEAE that led to 
discontinuation due to subject death. 
In addition to the serious sepsis observed during the run-in period, 3 serious infections were 
observed exclusively in the pegcetacoplan group during the RCP and none required study drug 
discontinuation.  Although  these  4  serious  infections  occurred,  none  were  infections  due  to 
encapsulated  bacteria.  A  viral  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (1.3%)  was  reported  at  the 
beginning of the RCP  when patients were still exposed to the combination of treatment. After 
starting  the  monotherapy,  2  subjects  (4.9%)  in  the  pegcetacoplan  group  reported  serious 
infections:  one  SAE  of  gastroenteritis  with  a  maximum  severity  of  severe,  and  one  SAE  of 
bacterial  infection  with  a maximum  severity  of  mild.  Both  events  were  deemed  not  related  to 
pegcetacoplan.  Eight  patients  (10.4%)  reported  a  serious  infection  during  the  OLP  with  2 
gastroenteritis (2.6%) and 3 sepsis (3.9%) of which one biliary sepsis and one post procedural 
sepsis. Serious diverticulitis, COVID-19 and upper respiratory tract infection were also reported 
by 1 subject (1.3%) each. There have been no reports of meningococcal infection or other serious 
infections  due  to  encapsulated  bacteria  through  all studies  in  which  patients  were  exposed  to 
systemic pegcetacoplan through the last data cutoff date (23 September 2020). However, taking 
into account prior experience of PNH patients treated with C5 inhibitors and review of published 
data describing the risk of infection in patients with congenital complement deficiencies, the small 
sample size of the clinical trial with a short exposure and follow-up, the risk of serious infections 
could not be excluded and should be closely monitored. In this context, serious infections have 
been  included  as  an  important  potential  risk  in  the  RMP.  The  Applicant  proposes  to  use  non-
interventional registry study to evaluate the effectiveness of RMMs on reduction and mitigation 
of the risk of serious infections with encapsulated bacteria. From the registry data, the applicant 
will also monitor the extent to which the aRMMs and SmPC are followed by prescribers and the 
extent to which they reduce and mitigate important potential risks (particularly the risk of serious 
infections) to enable evaluation of the effectiveness of these measures. In addition, actualisation 
of appropriate vaccination or antibiotic prophylaxis in patients treated with pegcetacoplan will be 
captured  through  the  system  of  controlled  distribution.  Annual  reminders  to  prescribers  or 
pharmacists will be used. These actions are considered appropriate to evaluate the effectiveness 
of  risk  minimisation  measures.  During  the  Study  APL2-302  there  were  significant  events  of 
pegcetacoplan related haemolysis observed (9.8% vs 23.1% in pegcetacoplan and eculizumab 
groups,  respectively).  Three  events  led  to  discontinuation  of  pegcetacoplan  during  the 
pegcetacoplan monotherapy; two events were considered related to pegcetacoplan with no other 
evident  cause  of  haemolysis  and  one  which  was  not  considered  related  to  pegcetaplan  was 
possibly explained due to obesity and suboptimal exposure. The 3 patients were withdrawn from 
the study and recovered from the event of haemolysis after a dose of eculizumab. In patients 
randomised  to  eculizumab  group,  3  patients  experienced  4  events  of  haemolysis  that  were 
considered definitely or possibly related to pegcetacoplan after discontinuation of pegcetacoplan 
after  run-in  period  on  study  Day  1.  No  events  of  haemolysis  occurred  because  of  missed  or 
delayed pegcetacoplan or eculizumab doses. A total of 18 subjects (23.4%) experienced TEAEs 
in  the  SMQ  of haemolytic  disorders during  the  OLP. All  events in the  SMQ  were  reported  by 1 
Assessment report

subject (1.3%) with the exception of haemolysis (15 subjects, 19.5%) and haemolytic anaemia 
(2 patients, 2.6%). This is consistent with what was reported in the RCP. 
•  Only one thrombosis event was observed in the primary safety analysis set and 2 subjects 
(2.6%) had events in the MedDRA HGLT of embolism and thrombosis during the OLP. 
•  One case of local hypersensitivity TEAE was observed in Study 204, Cohort 2. No SAE of 
hypersensitivity was observed in the primary safety analysis set. A total of 13 subjects 
(16.9%) experienced TEAEs in the SMQ of hypersensitivity during the OLP. Each event was 
reported in 1 subject (1.3%) with the exception of acute respiratory failure and erythema 
which was reported in 2 subjects (2.6%). 
A similar proportion of subjects in the pegcetacoplan and eculizumab groups experienced SAEs during 
the RCP: 7 subjects (17.1%) in the pegcetacoplan group experienced 8 SAEs, and 6 subjects (15.4 %) 
in  the  eculizumab  group  experienced  11  SAEs.  The  most  common  SAEs  were  in  the  SOC  Blood  and 
Lymphatic Disorders with twice as much SAEs in the eculizumab group than in the pegcetacoplan group. 
In the eculizumab group 2 subjects (5.1%) reported anaemia and 1 subject each (1.3% each) reported 
haemolytic  anaemia  and  haemolysis  whereas  2  subjects  (4.9%)  in  the  pegcetacoplan  reported 
haemolysis. One subject in each treatment group had an SAE that was  considered related to treatment. 
An atrial fibrillation was reported as an SAE in the pegcetacoplan group in 1 patient (2.4%). 
During the RCP, one SAE (2.4%) of facial paralysis in the pegcetacoplan group was considered related 
to study drug (pegcetacoplan), and one SAE (2.6%) of pyrexia in the eculizumab group was considered 
related to study drug (eculizumab).  
More SAEs (18 patients, 23.3%) were observed during the OLP than in the RCP. The most common SAEs 
were in the SOC blood and lymphatic disorders and in the SOC infections and infestations (8 patients, 
10.4%  each).  Each  SAE  was  reported  by  1  subject  (1.3%)  with  the  exception  of  haemolysis  and 
gastroenteritis. Haemolysis was reported for 5 subjects (6.5%) and gastroenteritis was reported for 2 
subjects (5.1%); neither event resulted in discontinuation. Three serious event of sepsis (biliary sepsis, 
sepsis and one post procedural sepsis) were reported during the OLP. 
A warning has been added to the SmPC section 4.4 that patients with PNH should be monitored regularly 
for  signs  and  symptoms  of  haemolysis,  including  measuring  LDH  levels,  and  may  require  dose 
adjustment within the recommended dosing schedule. 
There may be interference between silica reagents in coagulation panels and pegcetacoplan that results 
in  artificially  prolonged  activated  partial  thromboplastin  time  (aPTT);  therefore,  a  warning  has  been 
added to section 4.4 of the SmPC that the use of silica reagents in coagulation panels should be avoided. 
No deaths occurred in the pivotal study APL2-302 before Week 16. One death was reported during the 
OLP due to a fatal SAE of severe COVID-19 deemed not related to pegcetacoplan by the investigator. 
Other findings 
Overall, the laboratory findings were consistent with those expected in PNH patients. Observed 
changes in laboratory findings were reflective of pegcetacoplan efficacy findings. It is agreed with the 
Applicant that there is no safety signal regarding laboratory findings from the primary safety analysis 
set. 
Few cases of QT prolongation were observed in the primary safety analysis.  
Discontinuations due to the AEs 
Overall, the number of discontinued subjects was not negligible (10% in Study APL2-302, 0 to 14.3% 
in ongoing PNH and other ongoing systemic-use studies). There were in total 5 cases of pegcetacoplan 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/629737/2021  
Page 129/150 
 
 
 
discontinuations due to TEAEs in the primary safety analysis set. During the RCP, 3 subjects (7.3%) 
discontinued because of TEAEs, all in the pegcetacoplan group, and all because of breakthrough 
haemolysis, 1 was a SAE and 2 TEAEs were designated as pegcetacoplan related, both resolved with 
intervention. More details about these 3 cases are needed. There were in total 11 cases of 
discontinuations due to AEs in Study APL2-302 thorough 31 May 2020 cut-off date. Six of those were 
designated as pegcetacoplan related. Three were observed during open-label phase: intestinal 
ischaemia, hypersensitivity pneumonitis and haemolytic anaemia, and they were SAEs. 
There were 10 (13%) discontinuations from study treatment including 9 discontinuations due to an AE 
during the OLP with no trend in the nature of AEs leading to discontinuation. 
Supportive studies  
The number of patients enrolled in the 3 supportive studies (respectively 4  patients in study 202, 20 
patients in cohort 2 of study 204 and 6 patients in cohort 4 of study CP0514) is low compared with the 
number of patients enrolled in the pivotal study APL2-302 (80 patients). The posology between the 3 
supportive  studies  and  the  pivotal  study  is  also  different.  The  interpretation  of  percentage  of  TEAEs 
observed in the 3 supportive studies and the comparison with what was observed in the pivotal study 
are thus hampered. However, safety results in these 3 supportive studies are as follows: 
Among the 4 subjects in Study 202, the most common TEAEs were dizziness and erythema that occurred 
in 2 subjects each (50%). 
Among the 20 patients in cohort 2 of the Study 204, the most common TEAEs were upper respiratory 
tract infection (5 subjects [25.0%]), injection site erythema (4 subjects [20.0%]) and hypokalemia (4 
subjects [20.0%]). 
Among  the  6  patients  of  the  cohort  4  in  Study  CP0514,  the  most  common  TEAEs  were  headache  (5 
subjects  [83.3%]),  injection  site  bruising  (4  subjects  [66.7%])  and  injection  site  pain  (4  subjects 
[66.7%]). 
Drug-related TEAEs reported in the 3 supportive studies Study 202, Study 204, and Study CP0514 are 
consistent with what was observed in the pivotal study with the drug related injection site reactions that 
were  commonly  reported.  ISRs  occurred  in  2  subjects  (50.0%)  in  Study  202,  8  subjects  (40.0%)  in 
Study  204,  and  5  of  6  subjects  in  Study  CP0514.  Study  APL2-302,  no  ISRs  were  severe  or  led  to 
discontinuation in these studies. 
Two  SAEs  of  ALT  and  AST  increased  were  observed  in  one  patient  each  (12.5%)  and  were  deemed 
related to pegcetacoplan in the study CP-0514. 
No deaths occurred in the study 202 but 3 deaths occurred in the Study 204 and CP0514, 2 of which 
were on-study (aplastic anaemia in the cohort 2 of the study 204 and intracranial haemorrhage in the 
cohort 1 of the study CP0514) whereas the last was not on study (abdominal neoplasm in the cohort 2 
of the study 204) and none of which were deemed related to pegcetacoplan by the investigator. 
Among the 3 supportive studies, 3 subjects in Cohort 2 of the study 204 experienced SAEs that led to 
pegcetacoplan discontinuation: a fatal SAE of aplastic anaemia and a severe SAE of abdominal neoplasm 
that were both deemed not related to pegcetacoplan by the investigator and that led to pegcetacoplan 
discontinuation and subjects’ discontinuation from the study. A moderate SAE of hypersensitivity that was 
deemed related to pegcetacoplan by the investigator led also to pegcetacoplan discontinuation. 
Four serious infections were observed in the study CP0514, one sepsis and 3 urinary tract infections. 
Immunological events 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/629737/2021  
Page 130/150 
 
 
 
There  are  uncertainties  regarding  immunogenicity  testing  method  and  multiple  PK  OCs  are  raised. 
Antigenicity was observed during repeat-dose toxicity studies (non-clinical development). Pegcetacoplan 
was  weakly  to  moderately  immunogenic  in  rabbits  and  minimally  immunogenic  in  monkeys.  But,  the 
assay used is not completely reliable. In addition, in Compliance statements of several studies (13-catx-
004,  14catx-001,  14-catx-002,  14-catx-005,  and  15catx-004),  an  exception  from  GLP  is  reported: 
scientific interpretation of the antigenicity results were not performed in accordance with GLP regulations. 
In the clinical development program, there were high percentages of pre-existing anti-PEG antibodies 
(up to 82.5%). In Study APL2-302 RCP, two subjects (2.5%) had a positive anti-pegcetacoplan peptide 
antibody  response.  Furthermore,  one  subject  developed  treatment-emergent  anti-PEG  antibody 
response, and one subject developed treatment-boosted anti-PEG antibody response. Both events are 
considered  transient.  In  Study  204,  Cohort  2  one  subject  had  TEAE  of  rash  maculo-papular  deemed 
related to pegcetacoplan by the investigator. This event was temporally associated with positive serum 
anti-PEG antibodies. 
Overall immunogenicity are consistent across all clinical studies with infrequent and generally transient 
anti–pegcetacoplan  peptide  antibody  responses  detected  in  pegcetacoplan-treated  subjects,  a  high 
percentage  of  preexisting  anti-PEG  antibody  responses  reported  in  the  predose  samples  and  a  low 
incidences of treatment-emergent or treatment-boosted anti-PEG antibody response, with many of those 
responses that were transient.  
Presented  data  are  thus  reassuring.  However,  results  related  to  immunogenicity  in  the  pivotal  Study 
APL2-302  are  immature  and  the  Applicant  has  been  requested  to  provide  further  data  on 
immunogenicity. As such, Immunogenicity has been added as an important potential risk in the EU RMP 
and has been included as a safety concern to be monitored in the PASS (please refer to the RMP). 
Interactions 
According to the available data, the potential of pegcetacoplan for drug-drug interactions is low. There 
is an experience of concomitant use of pegcetacoplan and eculizumab obtained during Study APL2-302 
and  Study  CP0514.  It  is  agreed  with  the  Applicant  that  there  was  no  apparent  safety  issue  during 
concomitant use of pegcetacoplan and eculizumab in Study APL2-302. 
There may be interference between silica reagents in coagulation panels and PEGylated pegcetacoplan 
that results in artificially prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time. 
Non-clinical findings 
Nonclinical findings with potential to affect clinical use included epithelial vacuolation and infiltration 
of vacuolated macrophages to multiple tissues including renal findings (renal tubular vacuolation) which 
were  seen  in  repeat-dose  primate  studies.  For  the  time  being,  these  do  not  appear  to  correlate  with 
adverse  renal  effects  in  human  use,  according  to  limiting  available  data.  However,  the  risk  of  PEG 
accumulation and especially the risk of renal effects needs to be monitored and have been added as an 
important  potential  risk  in  the  RMP.  Reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  studies  have  been 
conducted  in  rabbits  and  rats  with no  effects on  maternal  or  foetal  endpoints after  pegcetacoplan  SC 
administration.  The  reproductive  toxicity  study  in  Cynomolgus  monkeys  found  several  spontaneous 
abortions and in utero deaths. The human relevance of these findings is unclear because contraception 
was required in all clinical studies. 
Special population 
One study in subjects with renal impairment, Study 205, has been performed. Pegcetacoplan was well 
tolerated across both the severe renal impairment and control cohorts with no major differences between 
cohorts  other  than  ongoing  TEAEs  and  concomitant  medications  reflective  of  the  underlying  medical

condition and not pegcetacoplan treatment. No dose adjustment is warranted in patients with hepatic 
impairment. 
The  pivotal  Study  APL2-302  did  not  include  children  or  adolescents.  A  PIP  waiver  was  given  for  the 
paediatric population aged <12 years whilst a PIP is in place for the paediatric subset aged from 12 years 
to less than 18 years and a phase study 2 is ongoing in paediatric patients. 
There are no data on use of pegcetacoplan during pregnancy and breastfeeding, except for one case of 
pregnancy that was reported in Study CP0514, Cohort 4 with no adverse effect on pregnancy, mother 
or child. 
Safety data in elderly are awaited. 
Other considerations 
Of note, C5-inhibitors have an important potential risk of malignancies and haematological abnormalities. 
It is agreed with the Applicant that a potential risk of malignancies and haematological abnormalities 
cannot  be  excluded.  This  has  been  reflected  in  the  RMP  and  “malignancies  and  haematological 
abnormalities” is an important potential risk.  
There are uncertainties regarding long-term PEG accumulation effects also considered as an important 
potential risk in the RMP. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the

Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety  
The  pivotal  Study  APL2-302  did  not  include  children  or  adolescents.  A  PIP  waiver  was  given  for  the 
paediatric population aged <12 years whilst a PIP is in place for the paediatric subset aged from 12 years 
to less than 18 years. A paediatric nonrandomised study of subjects aged 12 to 17 years (Study 209) is 
ongoing. This study is an open-label, single-arm, Phase 2 Study whose objectives are to assess safety 
and tolerability, PK, and biological activity (including efficacy and pharmacodynamics [PD]) of multiple 
subcutaneous doses of pegcetacoplan in paediatric patients with PNH. Twelve subjects planned. The final 
report is expected for 2024. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
With respect to the available information coming from a limited safety database with a limited follow-up, 
pegcetacoplan adds a mild additional toxicity to the target population treated with the proposed dose 
regimen of 1080 mg twice weekly subcutaneous infusion. However, the limited safety database does not 
allow to comprehensively determine the safety profile of pegcetacoplan in the absence of comparative 
long-term safety data especially in setting of concerned indication with chronic use.  
The safety of pegcetacoplan appears to be comparable to eculizumab in this randomized controlled Phase 
3 study, with a similar incidence of AEs and SAEs between both groups.  
The most common AEs observed during the randomized controlled treatment period were injection site 
reactions (ISRs) (36.6%), all types of infection (29.3%), diarrhoea (22%), abdominal pain (12.2%) and 
Assessment report

haemolysis (9.8%) with pegcetacoplan and haemolysis (23.1%), headache (23.1%), fatigue (15.4%), 
back  pain  (10.3%)  and  abdominal  pain  (10.3%)  with  eculizumab.  While  some  TEAEs  occurred  more 
frequently in the pegcetacoplan group (eg, ISRs and diarrhoea), others occurred more frequently in the 
eculizumab group (eg, haemolysis and headache). Infections were equally reported in the both groups. 
TEAEs  such  as  ISRs  and  diarrhoea  that  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  pegcetacoplan  group  did  not 
limit overall tolerability, as none were serious, severe, or led to study drug discontinuation. The most 
common AEs reported in the open-label phase (OLP) were ISRs (23.4%), haemolytic disorders (23.4%), 
nasopharyngitis (15.6%), and diarrhoea (13.0%). The incidence of ISRs and diarrhoea was lower in the 
OLP  than  in  the  RCP.During  the  randomized  control  period,  the  most  common  SAE  observed  in  the 
pegcetacoplan group was haemolysis (4.9%) and in the eculizumab group was anaemia (5.1%). Overall 
from the run-in period and over Week 16 (with preliminary results from the open-label phase), the most 
common  SAEs  reported  with  pegcetacoplan  treatment  were  haemolysis  (10.0%),  abdominal  pain 
(3.8%), gastroenteritis (3.8%), and sepsis (3.8%). 
Serious  infections  were  reported  with  pegcetacoplan  exposure  but  none  were  infections  due  to 
encapsulated bacteria. Serious infections have been added as important potential risk in the RMP with 
additional risk mitigation measure using registry data.  
More serious events of haemolysis or that led to study drug discontinuation were observed in the 
pegcetacoplan group although AEs of haemolysis occurred more frequently in the eculizumab group. 
There are uncertainties regarding immunogenicity testing method from the PK point of view that 
preclude conclusions on immunogenicity of pegcetacoplan. Immunogenicity has been added as an 
important potential risk in the RMP and has been included as a safety concern to be monitored in the 
PASS (Study APL2-302 and Study 307). 
Safety data from the OLP were consistent with what was previously observed with pegcetacoplan 
treatment. Most subjects had TEAEs with a maximum severity of mild or moderate during the OLP. The 
majority of AEs were not serious and there were no unexpected events and no AEs of meningitis. 
However, full safety results for Study APL2-302, compiling data across all periods of the study, are not 
yet available. Long-term safety has been added as missing information in the RMP. 
The applicant committed to conduct the following Post-Authorization Safety Studies (PASS), Category 3, 
as reflected in the RMP: 
- PASS using registry data for pegcetacoplan, to evaluate the occurrence of serious infections in patients 
with PNH treated with pegcetacoplan. 
- PASS using registry data for pegcetacoplan, to evaluate data on pregnancy outcomes  
In  addition,  the  Applicant will  continue  study  Study APL2-302  (To  establish  the  efficacy  and  safety  of 
pegcetacoplan  compared  with  eculizumab  in  subjects  with  PNH  who  continue  to  have  Hb  levels 
<10.5 g/dL  despite  treatment  with  eculizumab)  and study  307  (to  evaluate  the  long-term  safety  and 
efficacy of pegcetacoplan in subjects with PNH) 
The  Applicant  commits  to submit  a  Type  II  variation  to  update  the  SmPC  in  order  to  reflect  the  final 
Study APL2-302 48-week data.

2.7.4.  Conclusion 
The CHMP considered that the risk management plan version 0.4 is acceptable. 
In addition, the following minor revisions are recommended to be taken into account with the next RMP 
update: The applicant should replace the content of annex 6 by that of PI annex IID, subsection 
"Additional risk minimisation measures". 
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 14.05.2021. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A request to omit certain particulars from the labelling as per Art.63.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC has 
been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following 
reasons: 
The request to use minimum particulars for the 20 mL vial label was accepted by the QRD group, 
based on the fact that therapy will be initiated under the supervision of a healthcare professional 
experienced in the management of patients with haematological disorders, and that before 
self-administration is initiated, patient will be instructed by a qualified healthcare professional in 
infusion techniques, the use of a syringe system infusion pump, the keeping of a treatment record, the 
recognition of possible adverse reactions, and measures to be taken in case these occur.  All the 
relevant particulars are listed on the outer carton, moreover, the medicine should be protected from 
light and as such should not be removed from its outer carton until it is being prepared.  
2.9.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Aspaveli (pegcetacoplan) is included in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/629737/2021  
Page 138/150 
 
 
 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) who are anaemic after 
treatment with a C5 inhibitor for at least 3 months. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
To most effectively manage PNH, both IVH and EVH need to be controlled. This is reflected in 
improvements across the following key markers of disease activity: hemoglobin level, LDH level, ARC, 
bilirubin level, transfusion requirements, and FACIT-Fatigue score. The C5 inhibitors (eculizumab and 
ravulizumab), the only currently available treatments, have increased survival and improved outcomes 
in PNH by controlling IVH, reflected in LDH improvements; however, C5 inhibitors do not control EVH. 
In many patients treated with C5 inhibitors, although LDH is largely controlled, ARC and bilirubin levels 
remain elevated, indicative of ongoing hemolysis. Despite the availability of eculizumab over the past 
13 years, patients remain symptomatically limited by their disease and still require PRBC transfusion 
because not all key markers of disease activity are meaningfully improved. Considering the available 
therapies, there is no unmet medical need. However, new therapies that provide more complete 
control are needed. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study APL2-302 is the pivotal study submitted to provide the evidence of efficacy and safety. This 
study is a global, Phase 3, prospective, randomized, multicenter, open-label, active comparator 
controlled study. Its objective is to confirm treatment efficacy and safety of pegcetacoplan 
monotherapy for the treatment of PNH in subjects aged ≥18 years who were receiving eculizumab 
therapy but continued to have Hb levels <10.5 g/dL. This target population is reflected in the SmPC. 
Subjects were randomized to receive pegcetacoplan 1080 mg twice weekly or every 3 days if clinically 
indicated or their current dosage of eculizumab. This head-to-head comparator trial was designed to 
demonstrate superiority of pegcetacoplan to eculizumab monotherapy in subjects with PNH currently 
on treatment with eculizumab as measured by change in Hb level at Week 16. The 16-week RCP is 
completed; the 32-week open-label period is ongoing. 
The study enrolled 80 subjects; 41 in pegcetacoplan arm and 39 in eculizumab arm.  
The applicant further submitted efficacy and safety data from the Study APL2-302 open-label period 
from Week 17 through Week 48 + follow-up with a data cut-off date of 23 September 2020. 77 
Assessment report

patients were enrolled, completed the Week 48 visit and had either entered follow-up or the extension 
study, Study APL2-307.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
With the MMRM analysis, the least-square (LS) mean CFB in Hb at Week 16 in the pegcetacoplan and 
eculizumab groups was 2.37 g/dL and -1.47 g/dL, respectively. The difference in LS mean CFB in Hb 
between the 2 groups of 3.84 g/dL was statistically significant (95% CI 2.33, 5.34; P<.0001) and 
higher than the pre-specified difference between pegcetacoplan and eculizumab of 1 g/dl. The primary 
endpoint has been reached. A large number of subjects received transfusions in eculizumab arm 
(n=33) compared to pegcetacoplan arm (n=5). These data reflect a superiority of pegcetacoplan 
compared to eculizumab in terms of efficacy of control of the disease. The Applicant has provided 
additional sensitivity analyses of primary efficacy endpoint (based on imputation methods) and 
supportive analyses of primary efficacy endpoint data with all available data (uncensored for 
transfusion) which confirm this primary analysis. 
With regards to key secondary endpoints, pegcetacoplan met non-inferiority to eculizumab on 
transfusion avoidance, with 85.4% of pegcetacoplan subjects and 15.4% of eculizumab subjects 
achieving transfusion avoidance (nominal P value <.0001). This result is significantly clinically relevant. 
The proportion of subjects who were transfusion avoidant was similar in the pegcetacoplan group, 
regardless of baseline PRBC transfusion strata or baseline platelet strata, but not in the eculizumab 
group. Pegcetacoplan was also non-inferior to eculizumab for CFB in ARC, a marker of hematopoietic 
bone marrow compensatory activity in the setting of anemia and/or hemolysis, with an LS mean 
difference of –163.6 × 109 cells/L (nominal P value <.0001). LDH did not meet non-inferiority by the 
prespecified analysis. However, a greater percentage of subjects on pegcetacoplan achieved LDH 
normalization, as compared with eculizumab (71% vs 15%, respectively). Non-inferiority for the 
FACIT-Fatigue score was not assessed because of the prespecified hierarchical testing. Of note, higher 
numerical improvements were seen in FACIT-Fatigue score in the pegcetacoplan group as compared 
with the eculizumab group with a difference of 11.87 points (95% CI 5.49, 18.25; nominal P value 
0.0005). 
Improved outcomes with pegcetacoplan treatment, as compared with eculizumab treatment, were 
observed in others secondary endpoints at Week 16. Higher percentage of subjects in the 
pegcetacoplan group, as compared with the eculizumab group, achieving Hb response (75.6 % vs 0%), 
Hb normalization (34.1% vs 0%), and ARC normalization (78% vs 2.6%). Subjects in the 
pegcetacoplan group required fewer units of PRBCs to be transfused. The mean number of PRBC units 
required in the pegcetacoplan group was 0.6 and in the eculizumab group was 5.1 (95% CI: 2.0, 4.0). 
Indirect bilirubin levels decreased with pegcetacoplan treatment, but not with eculizumab treatment. 
LASA and QLQ-C30 scores increased in pegcetacoplan arm but not in eculizumab arm. However, no 
clear differences were seen between treatment groups in haptoglobin levels. 
Analyses based on stratification factors were in line with the primary analyses. 
Signs of breakthrough haemolysis while LDH elevated (after prior reduction of LDH) was observed in 2 
subjects (4.9%) in pegcetacoplan and 13 subjects (33.3%) in eculizumab arm. 
When all observed data were considered (no censoring of data due to PRBC transfusion), the results of 
all primary and key secondary analyses were consistent with the MMRM analyses in which post-
transfusion data were set to missing. 
Regarding Transfusion Avoidance at Week 48, fifty-five subjects (71.4%) in the total pegcetacoplan 
monotherapy group did not require transfusions, including 24 subjects (61.5%) in the crossover to 
pegcetacoplan group and 31 subjects (81.6%) in the pegcetacoplan continuation group. Moreover, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/629737/2021  
Page 140/150 
 
 
 
subjects randomised to the eculizumab group during the crossover to pegcetacoplan group who failed 
to demonstrate improvement during the RCP showed improvement after restarting pegcetacoplan in 
the OLP. 
Results of the key efficacy analyses of the OLP confirm the results observed during the 16-week RCP, 
suggest an improvement in PNH markers and fatigue and efficacy results were comparable to that 
observed for the pegcetacoplan continuation group. The PK analysis within OLP showed that 
therapeutic concentrations of pegcetacoplan were maintained for up to Week 48.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Because subjects in this study had to maintain their regular intravenous eculizumab dosing schedule 
during the run-in period, as well as receive twice-weekly subcutaneous pegcetacoplan, a double-blind 
study design was not possible, and a double-dummy design was not considered feasible by the 
Applicant. This is understood but is a limitation. Specific measures of minimisation of bias are outlined 
and it is acknowledged that the need of transfusions and the classification of patients as 
responders/non responders was done following objective lab tests criteria regardless of investigator 
opinion.  
Some imbalances in clinical baseline characteristics are observed, with more participants in eculizumab 
group compared to pegcetacoplan having the following: ≥4 transfusions in the last 12 months; higher 
mean LDH levels and more profoundly reduced haptoglobin, however, it seems that there was a 
number of censored observations in the eculizumab group. 
A GCP non-compliant site from the US that enrolled 2 patients was closed, but the patients were 
included in the ITT analysis. Their inclusion in the ITT set is questionable, but it can be considered 
justified. Sensitivity analysis provides confirmation of consistency with a main analysis. 
Eculizumab is underperforming in the pivotal study compared to published studies. However, under-
performance of eculizumab cannot easily be concluded because patient populations in the 
pegcetacoplan, eculizumab and ravulizumab pivotal trials were different.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of pegcetacoplan in the treatment of PNH patients, priory C5i-treated, is based 
mainly on one phase 3 and 3 supportive clinical trials: Phase 3 Study APL2-302 in C5i-treated subjects 
with proposed dosage of pegcetacoplan 1080 mg SC twice weekly (pegcetacoplan, N=41; eculizumab, 
N=39); 3 supportive Phase 1b/2a studies, Study 202 [C5i-naive subjects] (N=4), Study 204 [C5i-naive 
subjects] (Cohort 2, N=20), and Study CP0514 [C5i-treated subjects] (Cohort 4, N=6) with dosing 270 
mg/day SC or higher, but sufficiently comparable with proposed dosing. Data pooling could not be 
performed. 
With respect to the available information, pegcetacoplan adds a mild additional toxicity to the target 
population treated with the proposed dose regimen of 1080 mg twice weekly subcutaneous infusion. 
This is clinically characterised by TEAEs as injection site reactions (ISRs) (36.6%), all type of infections 
(29.3%), diarrhoea (22%), injection site erythema (17.1%), injection site reaction (12.2%), abdominal 
pain (12.2%), haemolysis (9.8%), injection site swelling (9.8%), asthenia (7.3%), injection site 
induration (7.3%), back pain (7.3%), pain in extremity (7.3%), headache (7.3%) and hypertension 
(7.3%) observed in ≥ 5% of the patients in the paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) 
population.  
Before Week 16 (from the run-in period to the end of the randomized control period) of the Study 
APL2-302, the most common SAEs (≥1%) were haemolysis (4.9%), bacterial infection (2.4%), 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/629737/2021  
Page 141/150 
 
 
 
gastroenteritis (2.4%), atrial fibrillation (2.4%), pyrexia (2.4%), facial paralysis (2.4%), dyspnoea 
(2.4%) and sepsis (1.3%). In the open-label period (OLP), the most common SAEs were in the SOC 
blood and lymphatic disorders and in the SOC infections and infestations (8 patients, 10.4% each). 
Each SAE was reported by 1 subject (1.3%) with the exception of haemolysis and gastroenteritis. 
Haemolysis was reported for 5 subjects (6.5%) and gastroenteritis was reported for 2 subjects (5.1%) 
Overall, from the run-in period and over Week 16 (with preliminary results from the open-label phase) 
of the Study APL2-302, the most common SAEs (≥2%) reported with pegcetacoplan treatment were 
haemolysis (10.0%), abdominal pain (3.8%), gastroenteritis (3.8%), sepsis (3.8%), infection (2.5%), 
haemolytic anaemia (2.5%) and anaemia (2.5%). Six subjects had SAEs which were designated as 
pegcetacoplan related by the investigator: haemolytic anaemia, intestinal ischaemia (reported with 
intrahepatic Budd-Chiari syndrome), biliary sepsis, sepsis, facial paralysis, and hypersensitivity 
pneumonitis. None led to treatment withdrawal. 
One death was reported during the OLP of the study APL2-302 due to a fatal SAE of severe COVID-19 
deemed not related to pegcetacoplan by the investigator. One on-study death occurred in Study 204, 
Cohort 2. It was due to serious TEAE aplastic anaemia (AA) which is designated as not related to 
pegcetacoplan by investigator. 
While some TEAEs occurred more frequently in the pegcetacoplan group (e.g., injection site reactions 
and diarrhoea), others occurred more frequently in the eculizumab  group (e.g., haemolysis and 
headache). Infections were equally reported in the both groups. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) include injection site reactions, infections, haemolytic 
disorders, thrombosis, and hypersensitivity. 
Injections site reactions (ISR) were the most commonly reported TEAEs in the pegcetacoplan group 
(36.6%) including injection site erythema, injection site reaction, injection site swelling, injection site 
induration and injection site bruising for the most of them. There were no TEAEs of ISR that were 
serious, severe, or led to study drug discontinuation. Most of the injection site reactions were a 
maximum severity of mild, with one report of moderate maximum severity. Injections site reactions 
were exclusively observed in pegcetacoplan group. The two events of injection site reactions in the 
eculizumab group were due to vaccination. During the OLP, 23.3% of subjects experienced ISRs during 
pegcetacoplan monotherapy. No subjects discontinued because of an ISR and no ISRs were severe 
during this period. 
Infections and infestations were equally reported in the pegcetacoplan and eculizumab groups during 
the randomized control period (RCP) of the pivotal study (29.3% vs 25.6%, respectively). Overall, 
infections observed in both groups were for most of them upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), viral 
URTI and gastroenteritis. Oral herpes were exclusively observed in the pegcetacoplan group although 
urinary tract infection were exclusively observed in the eculizumab group. All other types of 
infections/infestations were reported in 1 subject each in pegcetacoplan group or in the eculizumab 
group. Four serious infections were observed from the run-in period to the end of the RCP, a sepsis, a 
viral URTI, a bacterial infection and a gastroenteritis and none required study drug discontinuation. 
Eight patients (10.4%) reported a serious infection during the OLP with 2 gastroenteritis (2.6%) and 3 
sepsis (3.9%) of which one biliary sepsis and one post procedural sepsis. Serious diverticulitis, COVID-
19 and upper respiratory tract infection were also reported by 1 subject (1.3%) each. Through all 
studies in which patients were exposed to systemic pegcetacoplan through the last data cutoff date (23 
September 2020), none infection was meningococcal infection or other serious infections due to 
encapsulated bacteria.  
More serious events of haemolysis (4.9% vs 2.6%) or that led to study drug discontinuation (7.3% 
vs 0) were observed in the pegcetacoplan group during the RCP although AEs of haemolysis occurred 
more frequently in the eculizumab group (9.8% with pegcetacoplan vs 23.1% with eculizumab). Two

patients reported haemolysis that were deemed related to pegcetacoplan and 2 patients (4.9%) 
reported a serious haemolysis (4.9%) in the pegcetacoplan group during the RCP. In the OLP, 23.4% 
of subjects experienced TEAEs in the SMQ of haemolytic disorders. All events in the SMQ were reported 
by 1 subject (1.3%) with the exception of haemolysis (15 subjects, 19.5%) and haemolytic anaemia (2 
patients, 2.6%). Intravascular haemolysis after drug discontinuation is identified as important potential 
risk in the RMP. 
In addition to these AEs, TEAEs of diarrhoea were very commonly reported (22%) in the pegcetacoplan 
group (compared with one subject in the eculizumab group). All TEAEs of diarrhoea in the 
pegcetacoplan group were rated mild and did not lead to treatment discontinuation. The TEAEs from 
the SOC Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders were also frequently reported with a greater 
proportion in the pegcetacoplan group (16 subjects [39%]) including for most of them back pain, pain 
in extremity, arthralgia and neck pain. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety database is considered limited in terms of number of patients and in terms of follow-up. Six 
important potential risks are thus considered in the risk management plan (RMP): serious infections, 
serious hypersensitivity reactions, intravascular haemolysis after drug discontinuation, 
immunogenicity, malignancies and haematologic abnormalities and potential long-term effects of PEG 
accumulation in the choroid plexus of the brain and other tissues/organs. Taking into account that all 
these risks were not observed during the pivotal study due to limited number of patients and limited 
follow-up, it cannot be excluded that the safety profile of pegcetacoplan in the pivotal study has been 
minimised. If the important potential risks commonly occur after any authorisation then the additional 
toxicity could be much greater.  
In addition, taking into account of the small sample size of both groups of treatment (pegcetacoplan or 
eculizumab), interpretation of the safety differences between both groups can be only done with 
caution as the variability is non-negligible. Identifying a robust signal from a limited data source seems 
difficult. Full safety results for Study APL2-302, compiling data across all periods of the study are 
needed. 
Infections reported during the pivotal study could be an illustration of that. Indeed, although the risk of 
serious infections due to encapsulated bacteria is expected with complement inhibitors treatment, none 
was observed throughout the pivotal study and through all studies in which patients were exposed to 
systemic pegcetacoplan through the data cut-off date. However, taking into account prior experience 
of PNH patients treated with C5 inhibitors and review of published data describing the risk of infection 
in patients with congenital complement deficiencies, the risk of these type of serious infections could 
not be excluded.  
The underlying disease is a confounding factor as it is strongly contributing to the overall reporting of 
AEs in both treatment arms. Haemolysis, fatigue, headache, abdominal pain and back pain are indeed 
part of the symptoms of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria. 
There are uncertainties regarding immunogenicity testing method from the PK point of view that 
preclude conclusions on immunogenicity of pegcetacoplan. Moreover, the clinical results related to 
immunogenicty providing from the pivotal study are still not sufficient and it will be monitored further 
in the PASS. 
C5-inhibitors have an important potential risk of malignancies and haematological abnormalities. 
Although the PD properties are somewhat different, it is not anticipated that the risks would be 
different. It is deemed that those risks cannot be excluded, and the Applicant agreed to include 
malignancies and haematological abnormalities as an important potential risk. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/629737/2021  
Page 143/150 
 
 
 
There are uncertainties regarding long-term PEG accumulation effects. 
Patients with PNH-associated bone marrow failure (including aplastic anaemia PNH, myelodysplastic 
syndrome) that were not included in the pivotal study have a higher risk of serious infections due to 
neutropenia according to literature. The safety profile related to these patients is thus for the time 
being uncertain and the risk of serious infections could be seriously increased in case of any 
administration to these patients. Patients starting treatment with bone marrow failure are thus 
considered as missing information in the RMP. 
A PASS using registry data, study APL2- 302 and study 307 will investigate the important potential risk 
of serious hypersensitivity reactions, intravascular haemolysis after drug discontinuation, 
immunogenicity, malignancies and haematologic abnormalities and potential long-term effects of PEG 
accumulation 
There are no data on use of pegcetacoplan in children, during pregnancy and breastfeeding (except for 
one case of pregnancy that was reported in Study CP0514, Cohort 4 with no adverse effect on 
pregnancy, mother or child). A PASS using registry data will evaluate data on pregnancy outcomes.  
Experience with pegcetacoplan in Study APL2-302 in elderly subjects >65 years is limited to 17 
patients (21.3%). Although there were no apparent age-related differences observed in PK studies, the 
number of patients aged 65 years and over is not sufficient to determine whether they respond 
differently from younger patients. 
There are no available clinical data for the use of pegcetacoplan in patients with end stage renal 
disease (ESRD) requiring haemodialysis. Nonclinical findings with potential to affect clinical use 
included renal findings (renal tubular vacuolation), which were seen in repeat-dose primate studies, 
might be shown in clinical setting. 
PNH patients with body weight below 50 kg are predicted to have up to 34% higher exposure 
compared to a reference 70 kg subject. Although not many patients with body weight <50 kg are 
expected in clinical practice, the impact on safety of this increase in exposure is not known. 
At the time of planning Study 302, eculizumab was the only approved therapy for PNH. Since July 
2019 another C5 inhibitor (ravulizumab) is approved for the treatment of patients with PNH. Since 
eculizumab and ravulizumab share the same mechanism of action, it is acceptable to view the 
comparator in this study (eculizumab) as representing both available C5 inhibitors. Rigorous cardiac 
eligibility criteria and monitoring were implemented to discharge unanticipated cardiac risk.

3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Study APL2-302 is a randomized, controlled, global Phase 3 trial designed to compare the clinical efficacy 
of pegcetacoplan with a representative C5 inhibitor, eculizumab. The primary endpoint (CFB in Hb level) 
has been reached in this superiority trial. The following key secondary endpoints: transfusion avoidance, 
CFB  in  ARC  level  and  CFB  in  FACIT-Fatigue  score  were  consistent  with  the  primary  analysis.  Key 
secondary endpoints were tested first for non-inferiority and, if all were met, then superiority was tested 
sequentially  for  transfusion  avoidance,  ARC,  LDH,  and  FACIT-Fatigue  score  using  a  closed-testing 
procedure at a significance level of 0.05. CFB in LDH level did not meet non-inferiority by the prespecified 
analysis. However, a greater percentage of subjects on pegcetacoplan achieved LDH normalization, as 
compared  with  eculizumab.  With  respect  to  the  available  information,  pegcetacoplan  adds  a  mild

additional toxicity to the target population treated with the proposed dose regimen of 1080 mg twice 
weekly subcutaneous infusion. It was noted that the treatment effect on the primary endpoint is quite 
clear  at  16-weeks;  however,  the  there  is  a  need  to  be  re-assured  of  the  long-term  effect  of 
pegcetacoplan. The applicant submitted efficacy and safety data from the Study APL2-302 open-label 
period (OLP) from Week 17 through Week 48 + follow-up with a data cut-off date of 23 September 2020. 
77 patients were enrolled, completed the Week 48 visit and had either entered follow-up or the extension 
study,  Study  APL2-307.  Results  of  the  key  efficacy  analyses  of  the  OLP  confirm  the  results  observed 
during the 16-week RCP. 
The  amended  indication  reflects  the  studied  population  of  PNH  patients  anaemic  despite  current 
treatment with a C5 inhibitor. 
From a safety point of view, the main issue is that there is a limited database in terms of number of PNH 
patients exposed and in terms of duration of exposure, especially in setting of concerned indication with 
chronic use. The most prominent adverse events were diarrhoea and various infusion site reactions that 
were  observed  in  much  higher  frequencies  in  pegcetacoplan  group  compared  to  eculizumab  group  in 
randomised controlled portion of the pivotal study. Number of discontinuations was not negligible, with 
clinically  significant  events  of  haemolysis  that  led  to  pegcetacoplan  or  study  discontinuation. 
Immunogenicity  has  been  added  as  an  important  potential  risk  in  the  updated  EU  RMP  and has been 
included  as  a  safety  concern  to  be  monitored  in  the  PASS.  Serious  infections  have  been  added  as 
important  potential  risk  in  the  RMP  with  additional  risk  mitigation  measure  using  registry  data. 
Malignancies and haematological abnormalities are also added as important potential risk in the RMP. 
Additional long-term safety data are still needed to better characterise the safety profile of pegcetacoplan 
(added as missing information in the RMP). 
Long-term PEG accumulation has been added as an important potential risk in the RMP as requested and 
an endpoint to monitor this potential risk has been added to the post-authorisation safety study (PASS) 
using the International PNH Interest Group (IPIG) registry.  
A PASS using registry data, study APL2- 302 and study 307 will investigate the important potential risk 
of serious hypersensitivity reactions, intravascular haemolysis after drug discontinuation, 
immunogenicity, malignancies and haematologic abnormalities and potential long-term effects of PEG 
accumulation 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The  submitted  data  show  clinically  important  benefits  of  pegcetacoplan  in  patients  not  adequately 
controlled  by  eculizumab,  in  improved  Hb  levels  and  a  reduction  in  transfusion  after  16  weeks  of 
treatment.  Pegcetacoplan  is  administered  subcutaneously,  offering  patients  a  possibility  of  self-
administration that is unavailable with a C5 inhibitor. In the context of a life-long treatment, this is an 
important aspect from the patient’s perspective.  
Overall, the safety profile of pegcetacoplan in C5i-treated PNH patients is not so significantly different to 
that of eculizumab.

3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Aspaveli is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Aspaveli is favourable in the following indication: 
Treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) who are anaemic after 
treatment with a C5 inhibitor for at least 3 months. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
•  Periodic Safety Update Reports 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regards to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
•  Additional risk minimisation measures

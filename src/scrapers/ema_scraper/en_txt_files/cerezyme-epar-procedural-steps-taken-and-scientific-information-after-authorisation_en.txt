1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Update of the RMP to reflect the results of the THEME 
23/10/2014 
28/10/2015 
Annex II 
The MAH updated the RMP with data from the annual 
survey, which tested the effectiveness of the 
educational materials for home infusion, evaluated as 
MEA 040.7, and to reflect the results of the 6th 
annual report on the pregnancy and lactation 
Registry in Gaucher patients, submitted in parallel to 
the variation as MEA 040.8. The Annex II of the 
Product Information was proposed to be brought in 
line with the latest version of the QRD template 
(9.0). 
The requested variation proposed amendments to 
Annex II and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
C.I.11.b - Introduction of, or change(s) to, the 
obligations and conditions of a marketing 
authorisation, including the RMP - Implementation of 
change(s) which require to be further substantiated 
pregnancy report, including data from the 
pharmacovigilance database of the MAH and data from the 
Pregnancy Sub-registry. The data of the present annual 
report (1 June 2013 to 31 May 2014) is comparable to the 
previous reported year. No new safety issue has been 
identified.  
In addition, in line with the request made in the previous 
assessment report (MEA 040.7, CHMP conclusion adopted 
on 24 Jan 2014), the MAH proposes to use a questionnaire 
to follow-up each reported ADR as a routine 
pharmacovigilance activity to ensure that information is 
obtained on the setting in which the ADR occurred and risks 
associated with home infusion.   
The additional data submitted by the MAH are considered 
not to change the overall benefit/risk balance. 
The following point should be addressed by the MAH in the 
Page 14/28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
by new additional data to be submitted by the MAH 
where significant assessment is required 
next update of the RMP: 
- 
The MAH should be aware that in Section III.3 of 
the RMP it is stated that the final study report of the Home 
Infusion Educational Material Effectiveness Tracking 
(THEME) Study is provided in Annex 9. However, this study 
report has been removed from the annex in this version of 
the RMP. In annex 9 of the RMP version 7.0 the pregnancy 
report (number 6) is provided.

have shown that response to Cerezyme is dose-dependent.

disease and its clinical manifestations. Pulmonary 
hypertension is recognised as an uncommon complication 
in patients with Gaucher disease and is unlikely related to 
Cerezyme therapy based on current knowledge; pulmonary 
hypertension is therefore moved from section 4.4 to section 
5.1. Literature analysed refers only to treatment schedules 
with infusions every other week. Due to the demonstration 
of the effectiveness and safety of this two-week schedule, 
the 3 times per week regimen has become obsolete and 
therefore was removed from the SPC. Results from two 
clinical studies showed that maintenance treatment with 4 
weeks intervals could be a therapeutic option for some 
adult patients with stable residual Gaucher disease type 1, 
but clinical data are limited. 
Recommendation for the infusion administration has been 
made more informative in section 4.2 of the SPC by 
providing a recommendation for infusion rate only, 
removing the duration of infusion which is not taking into 
account the fact that the dose is individualised. Based on a 
cumulative review of the MAH safety database from May 
1994 to May 2008 backache was added in section 4.8 as an 
uncommon adverse event. This search identified 54 
adverse events (AEs) reported in 46 patients. Of these 54 
AEs, 52 were considered to be related to treatment and 36 
occurred within 24 hours of infusion.

"arthralgia" and "paraesthesia" as adverse reactions, 
as requested by the CHMP following assessment of 
PSUR 9 (covering the period from  
1 June 2004 to 31 May 2006). Section 4 of the PL 
has been updated accordingly. Section 6 of the PL 
was updated with the local representatives in 
Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary was updated. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
November 2006, a total of 52 case reports of arthralgia and 
15 case reports of paraesthesia were received. 
Paraesthesia was sometimes suggestive of hypersensitivity 
and responded to treatment with antihistamines and/or 
corticosteroids. These uncommon adverse events have 
been included in section 4.8 of the SPC and in section 4 of 
the PL.

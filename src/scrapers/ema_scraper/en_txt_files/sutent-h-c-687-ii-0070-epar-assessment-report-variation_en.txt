1.  Background information on the procedure 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Pfizer Europe MA EEIG submitted 
to the European Medicines Agency on 5 July 2018 an application for a variation. 
The following changes were proposed: 
Variation requested

Annexes 
affected 
C.I.4  
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new 
Type II 
I 
quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
Update of sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC in order to include paediatric study results (from 
studies A6181196 and ACNS1021) performed in compliance with a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
In addition the MAH took the opportunity to introduce editorial changes in the PL. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
The application included an EMA Decision P/0147/2018 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation 
plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0147/2018 was completed. 
The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP P/0147/2018. 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The aim of the variation is to update Sutent SmPC to include paediatric study results from studies 
A6181196 and ACNS1021 performed in compliance with a paediatric investigation plan (PIP), in order 
to provide physicians with the available information (dosing, administration, adverse reactions, 
pharmacokinetics, and clinical activity) in paediatric cancer patients, including those with 
gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST). The MAH is not seeking an indication in the paediatric 
population, as the clinical pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of sunitinib in children and young adults 
with GIST do not conclusively support a sufficiently favourable benefit/risk profile.  
The data (clinical pharmacology, efficacy and safety) included in this submission were collected from 3 
clinical studies: ADVL0612, ACNS1021, and A6181196. They were conducted globally to determine the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of sunitinib in paediatric patients with refractory solid tumors (Study 
ADVL0612), to estimate the objective response rate (ORR) to sunitinib in 
recurrent/progressive/refractory high-grade glioma (HGG) or ependymoma in pediatric (aged 18 
months to 17 years) and young adult (aged 18 to 22 years) patients (Study ACNS1021), and to 
evaluate the PK, safety, and preliminary anti-tumor efficacy of sunitinib in pediatric and young adult 
patients diagnosed with advanced, unresectable GIST (Study A6181196). Furthermore, results from 3 
modeling analysis reports, which provide additional sunitinib PK data, have been included in the 
submission. 
According to the MAH, based on the clinical pharmacology results, a starting dose of 20 mg/m2/day on 
Schedule 4/2 is predicted to provide comparable systemic sunitinib exposures to those observed in 
adult patients with GIST treated at 50 mg/day on Schedule 4/2.   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/28241/2019  
Page 4/109 
 
 
 
 
 
However, data from the phase I study ADVL0612 identified the 15 mg/m2/day as the sunitinib MTD in 
paediatric subjects without previous exposure to anthracyclines or cardiac irradiation. As stated by the 
MAH in the RSI, the MTD projection in ADVL0612 study was done in heavily pretreated pediatric 
patients mainly with CNS tumors. In addition, the starting dose in both clinical trial A6181196 and 
ACNS1021 was 15 mg/m2 (based on the MTD) with the option to escalate the dose based on toxicity. 
Further, the MAH noted that in the majority of the patients on the published case studies, the dose was 
higher than 20 mg/m2. The information that children treated in clinical trials/in case series received 
starting or average daily doses of 20 mg/m2 is not emerging from the SmPC, therefore it appeared 
somewhat misleading to report that the MTD is 15 mg/m2, and that 20 mg/m2 is the dose in paediatric 
patients expected to provide exposures similar to that obtained in adult patients with GIST. As per 
CHMP request, the MAH modified the SmPC section 5.2 to describe the dosages of Sutent received by 
pediatric patients in the clinical experience, in order to clarify the apparent contradiction between MTD 
and wording on 20 mg/m2.  
Based on the clinical data provided in paediatric patients with GIST (i.e. study A6181196 and 3 case 
series from literature), due to the lack of objective confirmed radiological responses, the limited 
number of patients in the clinical trial, the intrinsic limitations of retrospective case series, along with 
the indolent nature of GIST in paediatric patients, it is agreed that the available evidence does not 
conclusively support the clinical activity of sunitinib in children with GIST.  
The benefit-risk balance of Sutent remains positive.

5.  Introduction 
Sunitinib is an orally active small molecule multiple RTKs (PDGFRα-β, VEGFR1-2-3, KIT, FLT3, CSF-1R, 
RET) inhibitor, currently approved for metastatic RCC, GIST and pNET in adults.  
This  application  relates  to  the  submission  of  paediatric  study  results  with  Sutent,  performed  in 
compliance with a PIP. The following data are included in the dossier:  
 -  Study  A6181196  "A  Phase  I  Study  of  Sunitinib  (SU11248),  an  Oral  Multi-Targeted  Tyrosine  Kinase 
Inhibitor, in Children With Refractory Solid Tumours";  
-  Study ACNS1021 "A Phase II Study of Sunitinib in Recurrent, Refractory or Progressive High-Grade 
Glioma and Ependymoma Tumours in Paediatric and Young Adult Patients"; 
- Retrospective analyses of medical records from paediatric and young adult patients with GIST treated 
with sunitinib from 3 case-series publications; 
- Population Modeling Analysis Report.  
The scope of this Type II variation is to support the inclusion of relevant paediatric data in the sunitinib 
SmPC  (dosing,  administration,  adverse  reactions,  pharmacokinetics,  and  clinical  activity)  to  inform 
physicians  of  the  available  information  in  paediatric  cancer  patients,  including  those  with 
gastrointestinal  stromal  tumour  (GIST).  The  MAH  is  not  seeking  an  indication  in  the  paediatric 
population, as the clinical pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of sunitinib in children and young adults 
with GIST do not conclusively support a sufficiently favorable benefit/risk profile. 
The PDCO adopted on 29 June 2018 an opinion confirming the compliance of all studies in the agreed 
PIP  (P/0147/2018).  The  PDCO  positive  opinion  has  been  included  by  the  MAH  in  the  dossier 
(EMA/PDCO/255740/2018). 
The MAH stated that an updated RMP will be provided by 3Q2018.  
6.  Clinical Pharmacology aspects 
Results  from  3  modeling  analysis  reports,  which  provide  additional  sunitinib  PK  data  have  been 
provided:  
•  Population  Modeling  Analysis  Report  (PMAR-EQDD-A618w-Other-366)  entitled 
‘Population 
Pharmacokinetics-Pharmacodynamics  of  Sunitinib  in  Patients  with  GIST  and  Solid  Tumors’  describes 
key  safety  and  efficacy  endpoints  of  sunitinib  and  its  active  metabolite,  SU012662,  using  pooled  PK 
data  from  all  studies  in  adult  and  paediatric  patients  with  GIST  or  solid  tumours.  Two-compartment 
models  with  lag  time  were  successfully  used  to  describe  the  PK  of  sunitinib  and  SU012662. 
Mechanism-based and semi-mechanistic PK-Pharmacodynamics (PD) models were successfully built to 
describe key safety and efficacy endpoints of sunitinib.  
•  Population  Modeling  Analysis  Report 
(PMAR-EQDD-A618b-DP4-846)  entitled 
‘Population 
Pharmacokinetics  of  Sunitinib  in  Paediatric  Patients  with  GIST  and  Other  Solid  Tumors’  presents  the 
results  of  a  population  PK  model  for  sunitinib  and  SU012662  using  pooled  PK  data  from  studies  in 
paediatric  patients  with  GIST  or  other  solid  tumours  (ie,  Studies  ADVL0612,  ACNS1021,  and 
A6181196).  
• Physiologically based (PB) population PK Report (PBPK SimCYP Report) entitled ‘SIMCYP Prediction of

exposures in paediatric patients using PBPK simulations with SimCYP 
Assessment report

Page 8/109 
 
 
 
 
 
According to the MAH, based on the clinical pharmacology results, a starting dose of 20 mg/m2/day on 
Schedule 4/2 in paediatric patients with GIST (within age ranges from 6 years to 11 years and from 12 
years to 17 years) is predicted to provide comparable systemic sunitinib exposures to those observed 
in adult patients with GIST treated at 50 mg/day on Schedule 4/2. 
Following  discussions  with  the  EMA’s  Paediatric  Committee  (PDCO),  the  MAH  agreed  to  conduct  the 
single-arm,  open-label,  multicenter,  multinational,  Phase  1/2  clinical  trial  of  single-agent  sunitinib 
(Study  A6181196)  to  investigate  the  use  of  sunitinib  for  the  treatment  of  paediatric  GIST,  collecting 
safety, PK, and efficacy data in children aged 6 years to less than 18 years. The PDCO recommended a 
primary endpoint of PK parameters of sunitinib and its active metabolite SU012662.  
The  PDCO  accepted  the  MAH's  proposal  to  conduct  population  PK  and  PK-PD  analyses  to  help 
extrapolate the PK and key safety and efficacy endpoints of sunitinib to paediatric GIST patients based 
on  the  available  data  in  adult  patients  with  GIST  or  non-GIST  solid  tumours  and  paediatric  patients 
with non-GIST solid tumours. The analysis results were compared to the available safety and efficacy 
data in paediatric GIST patients from available literature to confirm the predictability of the models in 
paediatric GIST patients (PMAR-EQDD-A618w- Other-366).  
In addition, the MAH was requested to perform an integrated population PK analysis of the data from 3 
paediatric  studies  of  sunitinib  (PMAR-EQDD-A618b-DP4-846).  The  MAH  was  also  requested  to  build a 
PBPK  model  for  sunitinib  in  which  the  predicted  PK  concentrations  were  compared  to  the  observed 
concentrations in paediatric patients with GIST or solid tumours (Measure 5 of the PIP). The results of 
the  former  analysis  are  presented  in  the  PMAR-EQDD-A618b-DP4-846,  and  the  results  of  the  PBPK 
analysis are presented in the PBPK SimCYP report (PBPK SimCYP Report). 
6.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
One  of  the  main  objective  of  the  present  application  is  to  provide  supportive  PK  data  for  the 
administration  of  sunitinib  in  pediatric  patients.  Clinical  studies  included  in  this  package  were 
conducted  globally  to  determine  the  maximum  tolerated  dose  (MTD)  of  sunitinib  in  pediatric  patients 
with  refractory  solid  tumors  (Study  ADVL0612),  to  estimate  the  objective  response  rate  (ORR)  to 
sunitinib  in  recurrent/progressive/refractory  high-grade  glioma  (HGG)  or  ependymoma  in  pediatric 
(aged 18 months to 17 years) and young adult (aged 18 to 22 years) patients (Study ACNS1021), and 
to evaluate the PK, safety, and preliminary anti-tumor efficacy of sunitinib in pediatric and young adult 
patients diagnosed with advanced, unresectable GIST (Study A6181196). 
The  PK  data  included  in  this  summary  of  clinical  pharmacology  were  collected  from  3  studies: 
ADVL0612, ACNS1021, and A6181196:

The demographic characteristics of subjects who were enrolled in each study are provided in the table 
below: 
Study A6181196 
Study  A6181196  was  a  single-arm,  open-label,  multicenter,  multinational,  Phase  1/2  clinical  trial 
evaluating the PK, safety, and preliminary anti-tumour efficacy of sunitinib in children diagnosed with 
advanced unresectable GIST. The starting dose of sunitinib was 15 mg/m2 per day administered orally 
on  Schedule  4/2.  The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  characterize  the  plasma  PK  profile  of 
sunitinib  and  SU012662  in  children  and  young  adults  with  advanced  unresectable  GIST.  The  primary 
study  endpoints  were  the  PK  parameters  of  sunitinib  and  SU012662,  including  AUC24  (total  plasma 
exposure [AUC from 0 to 24 hrs]) and oral clearance (CL/F). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/28241/2019  
Page 10/109 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  assessment  of  the  paediatric  study  for  Sutent  (A6181196)  was  already  done  and  the  conclusion 
was  that  the  number  of  patients  enrolled  do  not  allow  to  draw  any  sound  conclusion  about 
pharmacokinetic  (PK),  safety,  and  efficacy  of  sunitinib  in  children  and  young  adults  diagnosed  with 
advanced unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST). 
Study ADVL0612 
Study ADVL0612 was an  open-label, dose-escalation, sequential-cohort, Phase 1 clinical study of oral 
sunitinib in children with refractory solid tumours. Of note, children and young adults were included in 
this study as 3, 7, and 6 patients ≤12 years of age in Part A, Part B, and Part C, respectively, and as 2 
and  1  patients  >18  years  of  age  in  Part  A  and  Part  C,  respectively.  The  aim  of  this  study  was  to 
determine  the  MTD  of  sunitinib  when  given  on  the  recommended  adult  Schedule  4/2.  The  clinical 
pharmacology  objectives  of  this  study  were  to  characterize  the  PK  of  oral  sunitinib  in  children  with 
refractory  solid  tumours  and  to  evaluate  the  tolerability  and  PK  profile  of  sunitinib  capsule  contents 
sprinkled  over  apple  sauce  or  yogurt  using  the  recommended  Phase  2  dose  (RP2D)  determined  from 
the dose-escalation part of this study. This study included 3 parts:  
-  Part  A  (12  patients  -  full  analysis  population)  (interpatient  dose  escalation):  The  starting  dose  of 
sunitinib was 20 mg/m2 QD with dose levels for subsequent groups of patients of 30 mg/m2 QD and 40 
mg/m2  QD.  If  the  MTD  had  been  exceeded  at  the  first  dose  level,  then  the  subsequent  cohort  of 
patients were treated at the 15 mg/m2 QD dose level.  
- Part B (11 patients - full analysis population) (interpatient dose escalation): After observing cardiac-
related  dose-limiting  toxicities  (DLTs)  in  Part  A  of  the  study,  the  protocol  was  amended  to  exclude 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/28241/2019  
Page 11/109 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients  with  previous  anthracycline  or  cardiac  radiation  exposure.  Part  B  was  initiated  to  determine 
the  MTD  in  the  revised  study  population.  The  starting  dose  of  sunitinib  was  15  mg/m2  QD  with  dose 
levels for subsequent groups of patients of 20 mg/m2 QD or 30 mg/m2 QD. Patients in Part B of the 
study had not received prior anthracycline treatment or cardiac radiation exposure.  
-  Part  C  (12  patients  -  full  analysis  population):  All  patients  treated  in  Part  C  received  the  RP2D 
determined  in  Part  B.  Patients  in  Part  C  took  each  sunitinib  dose  using  the  powder  contained  within 
sunitinib capsules sprinkled onto 5 mL of apple sauce or yogurt per capsule.  
This 
study  was 
evaluated  during 
the  procedure  n.  EMA/H/C/687/P46-048.  Overall, 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics  analyses  appeared  to  be  adequate.  However,  Pk  modelling  have 
been encouraged (PopPK, PBPK).  
In  comparison  to  adults,  the  single-dose  maximum and  0–24  hours  concentrations  exposures  as  well 
as  the  steady  state  trough  plasma  exposures  in  children  with  solid  tumours  appear  to  be  higher  for 
both sunitinib and its active metabolite SU012662. The correlative analyses with respect to the effect

of  body  size  and  age  supported  dosing  based  on  body  surface  area  to  ensure  uniform  total  plasma 
exposures across different body sizes and age ranges in children. 
The  pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic  correlative  analyses  performed  to  assess  the  relationships 
between  soluble,  CEC-  or  CEP-related  biomarkers  and  sunitinib,  SU012662,  and  Total  Drug  steady 
state trough concentrations, supported concentration dependent modulation of soluble as well as CEC- 
and CEP-related sunitinib pharmacological targets following multiple dosing with sunitinib in children. 
Study ACNS1021 
Study ACNS1021 was an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial designed to estimate the ORR for sunitinib in 
2  strata  of  recurrent/progressive/refractory  HGG  and  ependymoma  in  paediatric  (ages  18  months  to 
17 years) and young adult (ages 18 years to 22 years) patients. Patients received sunitinib 15 mg/m2 
as  capsules  in  6-week  cycles.  The  clinical  pharmacology  objective  (secondary)  of  the  study  was  to 
describe  the  PK  profile  of  paediatric  and  young  adult  patients  taking  sunitinib.  The  summary  of  PK 
parameters for each study group is provided in the table below: 
Based on the PK results of Study ACNS1021, both sunitinib and its active metabolite appeared to reach 
steady  state  by  Day  14  of  Cycle  1.  The  Day  14  mean  steady-state  trough  plasma  exposures  to

sunitinib (39.7 ng/mL), SU012662 (16.2 ng/mL), and total drug (55.9 ng/mL) appeared to be slightly 
higher  than  those  observed  in  the  Phase  1  Study  ADVL0612  by  20.3%,  1.25%,  and  14.1%, 
respectively.  The  plasma  exposures  to  sunitinib  and  its  active  metabolite  appeared  to  be  similar 
between patients in the HGG group and those in the ependymoma group. The dose-corrected plasma 
exposures  to  sunitinib  and  SU012662  appeared to be  higher  in  children  in  this  study  as  compared to 
adults in Study ADVL0612, indicating potentially lower CL/F per BSA in children as compared to adults.  
A total of 12 patients consented and had blood samples drawn for pharmacodynamic studies, of these 
samples  for  only  9  patients  (2  in  the  glioma  group  and  7  in  the  ependymoma  group)  resulted  in 
sufficient  quality  of  protein  in  the  plasma  for  analyses.  Profile  plots of  VEGF  and  VEGFR2  levels  were 
analysed: the mean plasma VEGF level did not significantly change from Day 1 (106.9 pg/mL) to Day 
14 (142.8 pg/mL) or to Day 28 (128.2 pg/mL). However, there was a decrease in mean VEGFR2 levels 
from 12379 pg/mL on Day 1 to 10103 pg/mL on Day 14 and 9676 pg/mL on Day 28. 
No  other  correlative  analyses  were  performed  and  PBMCs  were  not  analyzed.  No  tumor  tissue 
evaluations (genotyping and protein expression) were performed.

Dataset: The PK and PD (safety and efficacy) data collected during Studies 248-ONC-0511-002, RTKC-
0511-005, RTKC-0511-016, RTKC-0511-018 in adult patients with solid tumors, ADVL0612 in pediatric 
patients  with  solid  tumors,  A6181004,  A6181045,  A6181047,  RTKC-0511-013  in  adult  patients  with 
GIST were pooled for the population PK and PK-PD analyses. For the population PK and safety PK-PD 
analyses,  only the studies in patients with solid tumors and GIST were used whereas for efficacy PK-
PD analyses only studies of patients with GIST were used. 
All  the  available  safety  data  from  Study  ADVL0612  were  included  in  the  PK-PD  analyses  for  safety 
endpoints. However, for efficacy, the PK-PD modeling for the Sum of the Longest Diameters (SLD) only 
included adult GIST data.

central  compartment  apparent  volume  of  distribution  (Vc/F),  apparent  inter-compartmental  clearance 
(Q/F),  and  peripheral  compartment  apparent  volume  of  distribution  (Vp/F).  In  addition,  a  first  order 
absorption rate constant (ka) and a lag-time parameter (tlag) were used to characterize the absorption

Initially,  attempts  were  made  to  incorporate  the  sum  of  predicted  concentrations  of  sunitinib  and  its 
active  metabolite,  instead  of  sunitinib  alone,  into  the  sequential  PK-PD  base  models  for  selected 
endpoints (ie, SLD, platelet count, ANC, hemoglobin, and lymphocyte count); however, this approach 
did  not  lead  to  any  noticeable  improvements  in  the  model  objective  function  value  and  performance 
and was associated with significantly longer run times, and in some instances led to model instability 
or run terminations. Therefore, only the predicted sunitinib concentrations, based on its final PK model, 
were  used  to  produce  the  drug  effects  while  building  the  base  and  final  sequential  PK-PD  models  for 
different endpoints.  
The estimate of intersubject variability was provided as 95% confidence interval calculated as mean - 
1.96∙standard error and mean + 1.96∙standard error. The within-individual variability was modeled as 
an  additive  term  on  the  logtransformed  concentration  following  both-sides  log-transformed  approach 
for both PK and PD. 
Covariates  investigation  was  performed  using  the  basic  model.  The  covariates  were  subjected  to  a 
stepwise forward selection algorithm using a likelihood ratio test based on the change in the extended 
least squares minimum objective function (∆MOF). The significance level (α) chosen for covariate entry 
into  a  PK  or  PK-PD  parameter  sub-model  was  0.01  (∆MOF  of  6.63).  Covariates  were  systematically 
entered  into  the  sub-models  in  steps,  where the  covariate  with  the  greatest ∆MOF  for  each  step  was 
entered into the sub-model unless the addition of the covariate into the model resulted in instability of 
the  model.  This  process  was  continued  until  the  final  step,  where  no  covariates  could  meet  the 
criterion for entry. This model was considered the full model. The full model obtained from the forward 
selection procedure was subjected to a backward elimination algorithm using  a significance level of α 
=0.001  (∆MOF=10.83).  This  process  was  repeated  until  all  of  the  remaining  covariate  parameters, 
when  excluded  one  at  a  time,  resulted  in  significant  likelihood  ratio  tests  (p≤0.001).  This  model  was 
considered the final model. The covariates examined during building the final PK and PK-PD models are 
listed below:

For the integrated population PK (popPK) analyses in pediatric patients with GIST and solid tumors, the 
PK  data  collected  from  Studies  ADVL0612,  ACNS1021,  and  A6181196  in  pediatric  patients  with  GIST 
and  other  solid  tumors  were  pooled  (PMAR-EQDD-A618b-DP4-846).  The  objectives  of  the  popPK 
analysis  were    to  identify  covariates  which  account  for  the  inter-individual  variability  in  the  PK  of 
sunitinib  and  its  active  metabolite  and  to  make  predictions  pediatric  patients  with  GIST  within  age 
ranges 6-11 and 12-17 years of age. 
The  analysis  was  performed  using  nonlinear  mixed  effects  modeling  methodology  as  implemented  in 
NONMEM  (Version  7.1.2,  University  of  California  at  San  Francisco,  California).  Analyses  were 
performed using FOCEI. Additional software used in the analyses of the data were S-Plus Version 8.0,

Based  on  the  prior  knowledge,  a  2  compartment  model  with  first-order  absorption  (NONMEM 
subroutine ADVAN4) was used as the initial model to fit to sunitinib and SU012662 concentrations. The 
disposition  kinetics  were  modeled  using  a  parameterization  involving  apparent  clearance  (CL/F), 
central  compartment  apparent  volume  of  distribution  (Vc/F),  apparent  inter-compartmental  clearance 
(Q/F),  and  peripheral  compartment  apparent  volume  of  distribution  (Vp/F).  In  addition,  a  first-order 
absorption rate constant (ka) and a tlag were used to characterize the absorption process. The FOCEI 
estimation  method  was  used  to  estimate  all  the  parameters.  The  models  used  in  this  study  were 
mainly  adopted  from  the  study  of  Population  Pharmacokinetics-Pharmacodynamics  of  Sunitinib  in 
Patients with GIST and Solid Tumors (PMAR-EQDD-A618w-Other-366). 
Intersubject  variability  was  included  on  the  mean  pharmacokinetic  parameters  for  parent  and 
metabolite  SU012662,  including  CL/F,  Vc/F,  and  ka.  The  within-individual  variability  was  modeled  as 
an additive term on the log-transformed concentration following both-sides log-transformed approach 
for PK: 
where ln(Yij) denotes the observed concentration for the ith patient at time tj on logarithm scale, the 
ln(Fij)  denotes  the  corresponding  model-predicted  concentration  on  logarithm  scale,  and  εi  j  denotes 
the  intraindividual  random  effect,  assumed  to  have  a  mean  of  zero  and  variance  σ2  of  1.  W  was  the 
estimated variance of the residual variability that was one of the θs to be estimated. 
Based on prior experience, the following group of potential covariates were predefined in the PMAP:  
Potential  covariates  were  initially  graphically  plotted  against  ETAs  to  identify  any  relationships. 
Subsequently,  identified  covariates  were  tested  for  significance  in  a  stepwise  manner  using  the 
stepwise covariate model building procedure (SCM) application in PSN with statistical criteria of α=0.01 
for  forward  inclusion  step,  which  corresponds  to  an  objective  function  value  (OFV)  change  of  6.63 
based  on  a  Chi-square  (χ2)  distribution  with  degrees  of  freedom  (df)=1.  The  full  model  was  then 
subjected to a backward elimination step with a statistical criteria of α=0.001, which corresponds to an 
OFV change of 10.84 based on a χ2 distribution with df=1. The full model obtained from the forward 
selection  procedure  was  subjected  to  a  backward  elimination  algorithm  using  a  significance  level  of 
α=0.001 (ΔMOF=10.83). This model was considered the final model.

The  percentage  of  post-baseline  observations  which  were  BLQ  was  only  5.8%  (27/466)  and  10.5% 
(49/466) for sunitinib and SU012662, respectively. Therefore, the effect of BLQ data on modeling was 
not evaluated. 
The  dataset  for  the  pooled  analysis  comprised  439  sunitinib  and  417  SU012662  post-baseline 
measurable  plasma observations  from 65 patients  treated  with  sunitinib.  Descriptive  statistics  for  the 
subjects  baseline  characteristics  and  covariates  considered  in  building  the  population  PK  model  are

Sutent model  
A 2-compartmental model with first order absorption including tlag for absorption and elimination rates 
was  used  as  initial  model  for  sunitinib.  This  model  has  been  previously  used  to  describe  the 
pharmacokinetics of sunitinib. The correlation between the eta values for CL/F and Vc/F, CL/F and ka, 
and  Vc/F  and  ka  was  estimated  and  appeared  to  be  weak  (0.57,  -0.07,  and  -0.07,  respectively); 
hence, a full or partial omega block was not included in the base model for sunitinib. In addition, the 
diagnostic  plots  appear  to  be  satisfactory  and  the  model  appeared  to  be  very  stable,  as  indicated  by 
the condition number. Subsequently, the effect of extreme outliers (|CWRES|>6) on the population PK 
parameter  estimates  and  on  the  diagnostic  plots  was  tested  and  based  on  each  extreme  outlier 
observation  assessment,  four  observations  with  |CWRES|>6  were  excluded  from  the  dataset.  They 
were considered influential outlier observations as their exclusion led to greater than 15% changes in 
the  ω  of  CL/F,  Vc/F  and  Ka.  The  magnitude  of  the  spread  for  observations  versus  IPRED  was  small 
around  the  line  of  identity,  indicating  that  the  model  predicted  the  individual  concentrations  well.  In 
the  base  model,  η  estimates  appeared  normally  distributed  and  displayed  mean  near  zero  for  the  PK 
parameters.

To evaluate model stability and the CI of the final parameter estimates, a nonparametric bootstrapping 
approach was used (1000 replicates). The median values from 1,000 bootstrapping analysis runs were 
similar  to  the  parameter  estimates  of  the  dataset,  and  the  bootstrapped  95%  CIs  overlapped  with 
those  of  the  final  dataset,  suggesting  that  the  model  parameters  were  stable  with  the  exception  of 
Vp/F. The η-shrinkage was only 7.8% and 32% for CL/F and Vc/F, respectively.

The typical value for CL/F was estimated to be 24 L/h, Vc/F was estimated to be 1030 L. The key PK 
parameters in the final model with significant (α=0.001) covariate effect are shown below:  
CL/F = 24L/hr · (BSA/1.44)0.733 
During the SCM analysis, the effect of BSA was statistically significant on CL/F using a power function 
as  above.  This  effect  is  consistent  with  graphical  plots  that  showed  a  trend  with  BSA  and  this  PK 
parameter.  The  inclusion  of  BSA  on  CL/F  was  statistically  significant  (α=0.001).  The  inclusion  of  BSA 
on CL/F in the final model corrected for the previously observed trend in plots of η on CL/F versus BSA 
in the base model. 
V c/F = 1030L ·(BSA/1.44)1.46 
During the SCM analysis, the effect of BSA was statistically significant on Vc/F using a power function. 
This effect is consistent with graphical plots that showed a trend with BSA and this PK parameter. The 
inclusion  of  BSA  on  Vc/F  was  statistically  significant  (α=0.001).  The  inclusion  of  BSA  on  Vc/F  in  the

A 2-compartmental model with first order absorption including tlag for absorption and elimination rates 
was used as initial model for SU012662. Based upon pre-clinical observations, a conversion of 21 % of 
the  total  parent  to  metabolite  was  assumed  to  bring  the  magnitude  of  the  parameters  to  a  more 
physiologically  relevant  level.  This  model  has  been  widely  used  for  previous  sunitinib  and  SU012662 
reports. The correlation between the eta values for CL/F and Vc/F, CL/F and ka, and Vc/F and ka was 
estimated and appeared to be weak (0.453, -0.131, and -0.123, respectively); hence, a full or partial 
omega  block  was  not  included  in  the  base  model  for  SU012662.  In  addition,  the  diagnostic  plots 
appear  to  be  satisfactory  and  the  model  appeared  to  be  very  stable,  as  indicated  by  the  condition 
number.  Subsequently,  the  effect  of  extreme  outliers  (|CWRES|>6)  on  the  PK  parameter  estimates 
and  on  the  diagnostic  plots  was  tested  and  based  on  each  extreme  outlier  observation  assessment, 
two  observations  with  |CWRES|>6  were  excluded  from  the  dataset.  They  were  considered  influential 
outlier  observations  as  their  exclusion  led  to  greater  than  15%  changes  in  intraindividual  random 
effects. Therefore, Model 2 was carried forward. The magnitude of the spread for observations versus 
IPRED  was  small  around  the  line  of  identity,  indicating  that  the  model  predicted  the  individual 
concentrations well. In the base model, η estimates appeared normally distributed and displayed mean 
near zero for the PK parameters.

To  evaluate  model  stability  and  the  CIs  of  the  final  parameter  estimates,  a  nonparametric 
bootstrapping approach was used (1000 replicates; 91.8% successful). The median values from 1,000 
bootstrapping  analysis  runs  were  similar  to  the  parameter  estimates  of  the  base  model,  and  the 
bootstrapped  95%  CIs  overlapped  with  those  of  the  original  dataset,  suggesting  that  the  model  was 
stable with the exception of Vp/F and Q/F. The large relative standard errors of Vp/F and Q/F may be 
related  to  the  sampling  schedule.  The  η-shrinkage  was  only  8.15%  and  15.6%  for  CL/F  and  Vc/F, 
respectively. 
The effects of different covariates (Model 3) on CL/F and Vc/F were examined following initial screening 
using  SCM  to  identify  significant  covariates  to  be  tested  and  subsequently  by  applying  forward 
selection and backward elimination procedure until the final model was identified (Model 4). The typical 
value for CL/F was estimated to be 11.1 L/h, Vc/F was estimated to be 1060 L. The key PK parameters 
in the final model with significant (α=0.001) covariate effect are shown below  
CL/F = 11.1L/hr ·(BSA/1.44)0.87   
During the SCM analysis, the effect of BSA was statistically significant on CL/F using a power function. 
This effect is consistent with graphical plots that showed a trend with BSA and this PK parameter. The 
inclusion of BSA on CL/F was statistically significant (α=0.001).  
c/F = 1060L ·(BSA/1.44)1.61 
During the SCM analysis, the effect of BSA was statistically significant on Vc/F using a power function 
as  above.  This  effect  is  consistent  with  graphical  plots  that  showed  a  trend  with  BSA  and  this  PK 
parameter. The inclusion of BSA on Vc/F was statistically significant (α=0.001).

Sunitinib  has  been  studied  in  3  paediatric  studies:  in  children  (target  age:  2  to  21  years;  actually 
enrolled from 3 to 21 years) with refractory solid tumours in Study ADVL0612; in children (target age: 
18 months to 22 years; actually enrolled from 3 to 19 years) with recurrent, refractory, or progressive 
high grade glioma and ependymoma tumours in Study ACNS1021; and in children (target age: 6 to 18 
years;  actually  enrolled  from  13  to  16  years)  with  gastrointestinal  stromal  tumour  (GIST)  in  Study 
A6181196.  
The results of the clinical studies, including the mass-balance study and the 3 paediatric studies, were 
used  to  validate  the  performance  of  the  PBPK  model  for  sunitinib  and  SU012662.  The  sunitinib  and 
SU012662  compound  files  were  developed  in-house  and  verified  using  available  clinical  data.  The 
compound  files  for  sunitinib  and  SU012662  were  created  in  SimCYP  based  on  physico-chemical 
properties and human PK data, as summarised below:

Sunitinib  
The  model  development  employed  a  combined  “bottom-up”  and  “top-down”  approach  to  fully  utilise 
the  available  in  vitro  or  in  silico  experimental  data  and  in  vivo  observed  clinical  data.  The  first-order 
absorption  model  parameterised  with  a  fraction  of  administered  dose  absorbed  (Fa),  first  order 
absorption rate constant [time-1] (ka), and lag time for absorption (Tlag) was selected to describe the 
absorption  process  of  sunitinib  in  humans.  Ka  and  Tlag  were  set  as  0.236  h-1  and  0.527  h, 
respectively, based on the popPK analysis for the adults. The full PBPK distribution model was selected. 
The  tissue  composition-based  model  implemented  in  SimCYP  (Method  2),  proposed  by  Rodgers  and 
Rowland, was selected to predict the steady-state volumes of distribution (= CL•MRT) (Vss), with the 
tissue:plasma partition coefficients (Kp) scalar adjusted to make the Vss/F as 29 L/kg, which was the 
Vss/F  of  sunitinib  estimated  from  the  population  PK  analysis  for  the  adults.  The  retrograde  model 
implemented in the SimCYP was used to back-calculate the hepatic intrinsic clearance (CLint,hep) from 
the  population  PK  analysis  for  the  adults  estimated plasma  clearance  (apparent  oral  clearance  [CL/F] 
of 37.2 L/h). Based on the [14C]sunitinib human mass-balance study, the Fa  value was estimated to 
be 79.1% since 60.9% of the dose was ascribed to be metabolites of sunitinib, which are considered to 
be formed following oral absorption or drug-related entities (including sunitinib) excreted renally. After 
correction  with  the  total  recovery  of  77%,  Fa  was  79.1%.  Furthermore,  based  on  the  mass-balance 
study,  the  renal  clearance  (CLr)  of  sunitinib  was  set  to  4.05  L/h.  The  transformation  of  sunitinib  to 
SU012662  was  primarily  through  CYP3A4.  The  fraction  metabolised  by  CYP3A4  (Fm,CYP3A4)  was

determined  by  dividing the  total  amount  of  SU012662  recovered  in  the  faeces  and  urine  by  the  total 
amount  of  sunitinib  absorbed  minus  the  amount  of  sunitinib  excreted  renally.  The  Fm,CYP3A4  was 
calculated  as  66.5%.  After  entering  the  values  for CLr,  Fa,  fraction  of  drug  remaining  after  first-pass 
through the intestinal wall (Fg), and Fm,CYP3A4 information in the retrograde model, CYP3A4 intrinsic 
clearance  (CLint)  and  the  additional  microsomal  CLint,hep  were  estimated  to  be  0.603  µL/min/pmol 
and 41.6 µL/min/mg protein, respectively. 
SU012662 
The  CYP3A4  mediated  metabolism  of  sunitinib  was  used  as  the  input  of  SU012662.  The  full  PBPK 
distribution model was selected. The tissue composition-based model implemented in SimCYP (Method 
2), proposed by Rodgers and Rowland, was selected to predict the Vss. The Kp scalar was adjusted to 
make  the  Vss/F  as  42.3  L/kg,  which  was  the  Vss/F  of  SU012662  estimated  from  the  population  PK 
analysis  for  the  adults.  In  vivo  clearance  (CL)  was  derived  based  on  the  amount  of  SU012662 
recovered  divided  by  the  area  under  the  concentration-time  curve  (AUC)  from  time  0  to  infinity 
(AUCinf) of SU012662 in the mass-balance study, and was calculated to be 36.8 L/h.

SU012662 Model  
The effect of different covariates on the CL/F and Vc/F, and ka were examined using forward selection 
and backward elimination procedure until the final model was identified. The key PK parameters in the

A 2-compartmental model with first order absorption and elimination rates were used as initial models 
for  sunitinib  active  metabolite  SU012662.  Following  exclusion  of  observations  with  apparent  dosing 
errors, the effect of inclusion of lag time was tested and appeared to result in a significant change in 
OFV,  hence,  lag  time  for  absorption  was  included  in  the  base  model  for  both  sunitinib  and  its 
metabolite  Also,  the  diagnostic  plots  appear  to  be  satisfactory  and  the  model  appeared  to  be  very 
stable.  Subsequently,  the  effect  of  extreme  outliers  (|CWRES|>6)  on  the  population  parameter 
estimates and on the diagnostic plots were tested and based on each extreme outlier assessment, 10 
observations  with  |CWRES|>6  were  excluded  from  the  dataset.  Some  of  the  key  diagnostic  plots  for 
the base model are shown below:

For  categorical  safety  endpoints  hand  foot  syndrome,  fatigue,  nausea  and  vomiting,  the  PK-PD 
modeling  was  not  used;  however,  the  relationships  between  the  average  sunitinib  plasma  exposures 
up  to  time  of  the  earliest  worst  grade  and  the  incidence  rate  were  explored  by  using  ordered 
categorical logistic regression models. The individual average sunitinib exposure (concentration) up to 
time  of  earliest  worst  grade  was  calculated  as  the  total  dose  up  to  the  time  of  earliest  worst  grade 
divided by individual post hoc CL/F estimate for sunitinib divided by the time post first dose up to the 
time of earliest worst grade for the categorical safety endpoint. Based on sunitinib final PK and PK-PD 
models,  trial  simulations  were  performed  to  make  predictions  with  respect  to  PK  and  key  safety  and 
efficacy endpoints in pediatric and adult patients with GIST. 
ALT 
The PK-PD response model with KPD 1st ordered rate Contant (ie, slope) on Kout appeared to be the 
only  model  with  successful  minimization  which  met the  diagnostic  criteria  and  therefore  was  selected 
as  the  base  model.  The  correlation  between  the  eta  values  for  BASE  and  Kout,  BASE  and  KPD,  and 
Kout and KPD were -0.073, 0.06, and -0.29; hence, a full block or partial block model was not included 
in  the  base  model  for  ALT.  Based  on  each  extreme  outlier  observation  assessments,  6  observations 
with |CWRES|>6 were excluded from the dataset.  The key PK-PD parameter in the final model (with 
significant (α=0.001) covariate effect is: BASE = 20.5*(AGE/55)-0.188 .

ANC 
A  sequential  transit  compartments  in  series  with  feedback  loop  (TCSFL)  PK-PD  model  with  an  Emax 
model  effect  on  Kprol  constant  in  stem  cell  compartment  was  used  as  the  initial  model  for  ANC.  It 
appeared  to  be  the  most  parsimonious  model  and  was  selected  as  the  base  model.  The  correlations 
between the eta values for BASE and MTT, BASE and Emax, BASE and EC50, MTT and Emax, MTT and 
EC50, Emax and EC50 were -0.0001, -0.098, 0.24, 0.089, -0.15, and -0.53, respectively; hence, a full 
block  or  partial  omega  block  was  not  included  in  the  base  model  for  ANC.  Based  on  extreme  outlier 
observation assessments, 8 observations with |CWRES|>6 were excluded from the dataset. The PK-PD 
parameter  in  the  final  model  with  significant  covariate  (α=0.001)  effect  is:  BASE  =  4.715*(1-
0.195*RACAsian) 
AST 
The PK-PD indirect response model with KPD 1st ordered rate constant (ie, slope) on Kout appeared to 
be  the  only  model  with  successful  minimization  and  the  lower  OFV  which  met  the  diagnostic  criteria 
and  therefore  was  selected  as  the  base  model.  The  correlation  between  the  eta  values  for  BASE  and 
Kout,  BASE  and  KPD,  and  Kout  and  KPD  were  -0.06,  -0.02,  and  -0.46;  hence,  a  full  block  or  partial 
block  model  was  not  included  in  the  base  model  for  AST.  Based  on  extreme  outlier  observation 
assessments,  15  observations  with  |CWRES|>6  were  excluded  from  the  dataset.  No  significant 
covariates could be identified based on the initial screening using GAM. 
Diastolic Blood Pressure 
The  PK-PD  response model  with  KPD  1st  ordered  rate  constant  (ie,  slope) on Kin  appeared to  be  the 
most parsimonious model with successful minimization, lower OFV, and lower eta shrinkage which met 
the diagnostic criteria and therefore was selected as the base model. The correlation between the eta 
values for BASE and Kout, BASE and KPD, and Kout and KPD were 0.083, -0.10, -0.22, respectively; 
hence,  a  full  block  or  partial  block  model  was  not  included  in  the  base  model  for  diastolic  blood 
pressure.  Based  on  each  extreme  outlier  observation  assessments,  4  observations  with  |CWRES|>6 
were  excluded  from  the  dataset.  The  key  PK-PD  parameters  in  the  final  model  with  significant

Hemoglobin 
Reduced  model  such  as  TCSFL  with  KPD  type  effect  or  simpler  models  such  as  IDR  model  was  also 
examined  and  the  reduced  model  with  KPD  type effect  appeared  to be  the  most  parsimonious  model 
and was selected as the base model. The correlations between the eta values for BASE and MTT, BASE 
and KPD, MTT and KPD were 0.15, -0.11, and -0.06, respectively; hence, a full block or partial omega 
block  was  not  included  in  the  base  model  for  hemoglobin.  Based  on  extreme  outlier  observation 
assessments, 3 observations with |CWRES|>6 were excluded from the dataset. The PK-PD parameter

most parsimonious model with successful minimization, lower OFV, and lower eta shrinkage which met 
the diagnostic criteria and therefore was selected as the base model. The correlation between the eta 
values for BASE and Kout, BASE and KPD, and Kout and KPD were considered weak (- 0.27, -0.27, and 
0.32,  respectively);  hence,  a  full  block  or  partial  block  model  was  not  included  in  the  base  model  for

PK-PD Trial Simulations in Pediatric and Adult Patients with GIST  
Predicted PK, Safety, and Efficacy Profiles at 15 mg/m2 in Children 6-11 Years, 12-17 years, 
and in Adult Patients with GIST Based on Final PK-PD Models 
Based  on  the  final  population  PK  and  PK-PD  models  established,  trial  simulations  were  carried  out  to 
provide predictions with respect to PK, safety, and efficacy of sunitinib in pediatric patients with GIST 
(age  groups  6-11  [n(number  of  patients)=210]  and  12-17  years  [n=210])  in  comparison  to  adult 
patients  with  GIST  [n=210].  In  the  pediatric  age  groups,  children  received  doses  ranging  from  6.25 
mg up to 50 mg on Schedule 4/2 whereas adults only received 50 mg doses on Schedule 4/2. A total 
of  20  trial  simulations  were  run  in  which  the  pediatric  arms  consisted  of  pediatric  patients,  assigned 
demographics comparable to those for children growth statistics and for pediatric GIST; whereas, the 
comparator arm consisted of adult patients, assigned demographics consistent with those from dataset 
for adult patients with GIST. Subsequently, based on the simulated body size demographics, children 
within  each  age  group  who  had  received  doses  of  15  mg/m2  (ie,  ≥12.5  mg/m2  and  <17.5  mg/m2) 
were  subsetted  and  the  predicted  PK  and  PD  profiles  were  compared  to  those  from  adults.  The 
simulated  median  profiles for  safety  (ALT,  ANC,  AST,  BP,  HGB,  LVEF,  lymphocyte  count,  and  platelet

Subsequently,  additional  trial  simulations  were  run  using  the  predicted  average  sunitinib 
concentrations in each age group and assuming 40% intersubject variability to predict the probability 
of incidence of adverse events HFS, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue in pediatric patient age groups and

Patients with GIST Based on Final PK-PD Models 
Based  on  the  final  population  PK  and  PK-PD  models  established,  for  each  endpoint,  additional  trial

in  a  typical  age  and  gender  group  pediatric  patient  population  as  those  from  studies  conducted  by 
Janeway  et  al  and  Agaram  et  al  studies  administered  either  the  starting  dose  (ie,  25-50  mg;  ~  25 
mg/m2) or the maximum dose (ie, 25-50 mg; ~ 30 mg/m2) within those studies. A total of 200 trial 
simulations were run in which the pediatric arm consisted of pediatric patients (n=11) with the same 
demographics  as  those  in  Janeway  et  al  and  Agaram  et  al  studies  receiving  the  initial  starting  doses 
and  the  comparator  arm  included  adult  patients  (n=11)  with  GIST  all  receiving  50  mg  on  Schedule 
4/2.  Subsequently,  another  set  of  200  trial  simulations  were  run  in  which  the  pediatric  arm  received 
the  maximum  doses  instead  of  the  starting  doses  from  the  Janeway  et  al  and  Agaram  et  al  studies.

of incidence of adverse events HFS, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue in pediatric patient age groups and 
in adults with GIST based on the final PK-PD models for each endpoint. The results clearly indicate that 
sunitinib plasma exposures were higher in Janeway and Agaram patients dosed at their starting doses 
as compared to pediatric patients with GIST dosed at 15 mg/m2 in both pediatric groups, and that the 
levels in Janeway and Agaram studies although still lower (ie, by 12%) were much closer to those in 
adult  patients  with  GIST  receiving  50  mg.  Based  on  the  trial  simulations  described  previously,  the 
predicted  median  (95%  CI)  for  TTP  and  ORR  were  24.8(10.5-42.6)  weeks  and  9.0(0.0-36.0)  %  in

Population Modeling Analysis Report (PMAR-EQDD-A618b-DP4-846) 
The  effects  of  important  covariates  on  PK  parameters  were  evaluated  using  a  stepwise  covariate 
selection procedure in which BSA was the only statistically significant covariate (p≤0.001) for CL/F and 
Vc/F in the final PK models of both sunitinib and SU012662. Other covariates such as age, tumour type 
(GIST  vs  other  solid  tumours),  race  (Asian  vs  non-  Asian),  baseline  Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology

Group (ECOG) performance status (>0 vs 0), Sex (male vs female) were not found to have statistically 
significant (p>0.001) effects on CL/F or Vc/F.  
Based  on  the  final  PK  models,  in  a  typical  paediatric  patient  with  GIST  or  other  solid  tumours  within 
the age groups of 2 years to 5 years (median BSA  of 0.69 m2), 6 years to 11 years (median BSA of 
1.1  m2),  and  12  years  to  17  years  (median  BSA  of  1.6  m2),  the  sunitinib  doses  that  will  lead  to 
predicted steady- state total plasma exposure over the dosing interval (ie, steady-state AUC24) similar 
to  what  have  been  observed  in  adults  with  GIST  (1233  ng.hr/mL  for  sunitinib  and  551  ng.hr/mL  for 
SU012662)  at  50  mg  are  25  mg/m2,  22  mg/m2,  and  20  mg/m2  for  sunitinib  and  22  mg/m2,  21 
mg/m2, and 20 mg/m2 for SU012662, respectively. Therefore, in paediatric patients with GIST within 
the  age  range  from  6  years  to  17  years,  a  dose  of  approximately  20  mg/m2  is  expected  to  provide 
overall similar extent of total plasma exposures to sunitinib and its active metabolite as compared to 
adults  with  GIST  administered  sunitinib  50  mg  on  Schedule  4/2.  BSA-tiered  dosing  in  children  to 
achieve steady-state sunitinib and SU012662 AUC observed in adult patients with GIST at the sunitinib 
dose  of  50  mg  were  predicted  to  be  12.5  mg,  25  mg,  37.5  mg,  50  mg  QD  on  Schedule  4/2  for 
paediatric patients with BSAs of ≤0.7 m2, 0.8-1.5 m2, 1.6-2.4 m2, and ≥2.5 m2, respectively. 
SIMULATIONS 
Predicted Sunitinib AUC and BSA-Tiered Dosing Based on Final Sunitinib PK Model 
Bootstrapping techniques were used to estimate the expected effect of the significant covariate BSA on 
sunitinib AUC relative to the reference, an adult patient with GIST at sunitinib dose of 50 mg (sunitinib 
AUC  of  1233  ng.hr/mL).  This  analysis  showed  that  the  relative  AUC  values  for  a  typical  pediatric 
patient 6-17 years of age at sunitinib dose of 20 mg/m2 is predicted to be between 75% and 125% of 
the AUC of the reference.

Furthermore, using the final sunitinib PK model, the doses (in mg) to achieve the steady state 24-hour 
sunitinib AUC of 1233 ng.hr/mL, observed in adult patients with GIST at the sunitinib dose of 50 mg, 
were  calculated  (Table  below).  Subsequently,  based  on  the  calculated  dose  and  the  commercially 
available sunitinib dose levels (i.e., 12.5, 25, 37.5, and 50 mg), sunitinib BSA-tiered dosing in children 
was determined.

(SU012662  AUC  of  551  ng.hr/mL).  This  analysis  showed  that  the  relative  AUC  values  for  pediatric 
patients 6-17 years of age at sunitinib dose of 20 mg/m2 is predicted to be between 75% and 125% of 
the AUC of the reference.

Furthermore,  using  the  final  SU012662  PK  model,  the  doses  (in  mg)  to  achieve  the  steady  state  24-
hour SU012662 AUC of 551 ng.hr/mL, observed in adult patients with GIST at the sunitinib dose of 50 
mg, were calculated (Table below). Subsequently, based on the calculated dose and the commercially 
available sunitinib dose levels (i.e.,12.5, 25, 37.5, and 50 mg), sunitinib BSA-tiered dosing in children 
was determined.

There  was  a  great  overlap  in  the  BSA-tiered  dosing  brackets  based  on  the  metabolite  exposure  as 
compared to the sunitinib exposure; however, in cases where there were differences in the determined 
tiered dose, the preference was given to the tiered dose determination based on sunitinib considering 
that the plasma exposure to sunitinib was much larger than that of the metabolite. 
PBPK SimCYP 
SimCYP Simulation Design 
Simulations in SimCYP were performed with a virtual population of healthy volunteers in 10 trials of 10 
subjects  each  in  a  fasted  condition.  The  Standard  model  virtual  population  was  used,  and  the 
Paediatric module was selected for performing PK prediction in paediatrics.

There  is  a  relatively  good  prediction  of  the  exposures  of  sunitinib  for  Study  ADVL0612,  instead  the 
exposure of SU012662 for Study ADVL0612 was underestimated. 
 There  is  a  relatively  good  prediction  of  the  exposures  of  sunitinib,  SU012662,  and  the  total  active

SU012662, and the total active moieties.

There is a relatively good prediction of the exposures of sunitinib and SU012662 for Study A6181196, 
as a result, there is also a good prediction of the exposures of the total active moieties. 
Modelling underestimation of sunitinib, SU012662, and total active moieties exposures 
Assuming  an  approximate  15%  underestimation  of  SimCYP  exposures  (average  total  drug  AUC24 
underestimation,  SimCYP  Report  Section  4),  the  revised  projected  doses  based  on  SimCYP  (ie,  19 
mg/m2  for  6-11  years  and  21  mg/m2  for  12-17  years  instead  of  22  mg/m2  for  6-11  years  and  25 
mg/m2 for 12-17 years) would be even closer to the dose of 20 mg/m2 (ie, within approximately 5% 
instead  of  25%)  and  remain  consistent  with  and  confirming  the  dose  determined  by  the  integrated 
population  PK  analysis  (20  mg/m2).  Therefore,  in  both  scenarios,  the  dose  projections  by  SimCYP 
approach support the 20 mg/m2 dose determined by the integrated population PK analysis.

Comparison  of  Predicted  and  Observed  Sunitinib  and  SU012662  Exposure  at  Steady  State  Following 
15-mg/m2 Oral Dose of Sunitinib in Adults and Paediatrics 
A comparison of the clinically observed and simulated steady state systemic exposure of sunitinib and 
SU012662 following 15-mg/m2 daily oral administration of sunitinib is summarised in the table below: 
The exposure of sunitinib decreases with the increase of age for the 3 paediatric age groups, and the 
exposure of SU012662 increases with the increase of age for the 3 paediatric age groups. 
The MAH conducted additional simulations with 20 mg/m2 daily dosage and compared to the observed 
pediatric data. As the observed pediatric data were at 15 mg/m2 daily dosage, the observed exposure 
parameters  were  dose  corrected  to  20  mg/m2  for  comparison  purpose.  The  tables  below  show 
clinically  observed  dose-corrected  and  SimCYP-predicted  sunitinib  and  SU012662  pharmacokinetic 
parameter estimates in pediatrics in Study ADVL0612 (3-21 years old), Study ACNS1021 (3-19 years 
old),  and  Study  A6181196  (13-16  years  old)  after  a  multiple  20-mg/m2  daily  oral  dose  of  sunitinib, 
respectively.    Overall,  the  ratios  of  the  predicted  versus  observed  dose-corrected  exposure  values 
following trial simulations with the dose of 20 mg/m2 were essentially the same as the ones obtained 
with the dose of 15 mg/m2 (SimCYP Report Section 4), which is not unexpected considering the dose-
linearity in the PK model.

6.3.  Discussion 
In  the  PK-PD  analysis  of  Sunitinib  in  Patients  with  GIST  (PMAREQDD-A618w-Other-366)  paediatric 
data  from  only  1  clinical  study  have  been  included  in  the  dataset  (study  ADVL0612).  In  this  study 
patients  with  solid  tumours  have  been  enrolled,  but  the  MAH  stated  that  for  efficacy  PK-PD  analyses 
only studies of patients with GIST were used. ADVL0612 study data for the PK/PD model were included 
only for safety endpoints. The descriptive statistics for the subjects baseline characteristics from study 
ADVL0612 have not been provided, however it has been found in the study report body submitted for 
a previous variation application.

Considering that tumour type is a covariate for lymphocyte count and platelet count, and the impact of 
the different tumour type on PK-PD relationship has not been evaluated, the reliability of efficacy and 
safety  predictions  through  trials  simulation  is  questioned,  but  this  issue  will  not  be  pursued  being 
efficacy and safety analysis out of the scope of the present variation. 
The  popPK  (PMAR-EQDD-A618b-DP4-846)  analysis  has  confirmed  the  importance  of  the  BSA  as 
covariate  on  CL/F  and  Vc/F  for  both  sunitinib  and  its  active  metabolite,  as  observed  also  in  previous 
studies, i.e. ACNS1021 and ADVL0612. MAH’s conclusions include the following: respective BSA-tiered 
doses of 12.5, 25, 37.5, and 50 mg QD on Schedule 4/2 for pediatric patients with BSA of ≤0.7, 0.8 to 
1.2, 1.6 to 2.4, and ≥2.5 m2 are predicted to provide plasma exposures to sunitinib comparable with 
those  observed  in  adult  patients  with  GIST  treated  with  a  dose  of  50  mg/day  on  Schedule  4/2. 
However the figure reporting the ratio of predicted AUC values related to the values in adult reference 
following multiple dosing of sunitinib 20 mg/m2 showed that, for paediatric patients with BSA values < 
1.1 m2 , the ratio is lower that 75%; therefore for this patient population the MAH’s conclusion cannot 
be supported. Considering the above, a reference also to BSA values in the proposed text on SmPC has 
been added.   
Regarding  the  PBPK  model,  except  for  the  AUC0-8  values  for  study  A6181196,  the  results  of  the 
external  validation  show  that  the  predicted/observed  ratios  for  all  the  other  parameters  for  both 
sunitinib and its active metabolite are <1, indicating that all the predicted values are minor compared 
to  the  observed  values.  This  lead  to  conclude  that  the  model  predicts  with  an  (slightly) 
underestimation  the  exposure    of  sunitinib,  SU012662,  and  total  active  moieties.  Based  on  SimCYP, 
the  revised  projected  dose,  assuming  an  approximate  15%  of  SimCYP  exposure,  remains  consistent 
with  dose  determined  by  the  integrated  population  PK  analysis  (20  mg/m2).  Moreover  all  the 
simulated  exposure  measures  of  sunitinib  and  SU012662  were  done  following  15mg/m2  daily  oral 
administration  of  sunitinib,  however  the  proposed  dosage  to  be  included  in  the  SmPC  is  20mg/m2 
daily.    As  the  observed  pediatric  data  were  at  15  mg/m2  daily  dosage,  the  observed  exposure 
parameters  were  dose  corrected  to  20  mg/m2  for  comparison  purpose  and  an  additional  simulation 
with 20 mg/m2 daily dosage and compared to the observed pediatric data.  The ratios of the predicted 
versus observed dose-corrected exposure values following trial simulations with the dose of 20 mg/m2 
were very closed to the ones obtained with the dose of 15 mg/m2. 
Based on the information provided at the RSI, the difference between the initial population PK analysis 
(pooled  data  from  adult  and  paediatric  patients)  and  the  integrated  population  PK  analysis  (only 
paediatric data) is the inclusion of Tumor type as covariate on CL/F. In the first analysis it resulted to 
be  significant,  in  the  second  one  not.  The  integrated  population  PK  analysis  was  selected  as  final 
analysis to be used to calculate the dose in pediatric patients expected to provide exposures similar to 
that obtained in adult patients with GIST at 50 mg on Schedule 4/2. 
However, data from the phase I study ADVL0612 identified the 15 mg/m2/day as the sunitinib MTD in 
paediatric subjects without previous exposure to anthracyclines or cardiac irradiation. As stated by the 
MAH  in  the  RSI,  the  MTD  projection  in  ADVL0612  study  was  done  in  heavily  pretreated  pediatric 
patients  mainly  with  CNS  tumors.  In  addition,  the  starting  dose  in  both  clinical  trial  A6181196  and 
ACNS1021 was 15 mg/m2 (based on the MTD) with the option to escalate the dose based on toxicity. 
Further, the MAH noted that in the majority of the patients on the published case studies, the dose was 
higher  than  20  mg/m2.  The  information  that  children  treated  in  clinical  trials/in  case  series  received 
starting  or  average  daily  doses  of  20  mg/m2  is  not  emerging  from  the  SmPC,  therefore  it  appears 
somewhat misleading to report that the MTD is 15 mg/m2, and that 20 mg/m2 is the dose in pediatric 
patients  expected  to  provide  exposures  similar  to  that  obtained  in  adult  patients  with  GIST.  As  per 
CHMP request, the MAH modified the SmPC section 5.2 to describe the dosages of Sutent received by 
pediatric patients in the clinical experience, in order to clarify the apparent contradiction between MTD

and wording on 20 mg/m2.  
7.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
7.1.  Study A6181196  
Study A6181196 was evaluated within EMA/H/C/000687/P46-053 procedure. A summary of key study 
results is presented below.   
Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Study  A6181196  was  a  single-arm,  open-label,  multicenter,  multinational,  Phase  1/2  clinical  trial 
evaluating the PK, safety, and preliminary anti-tumour efficacy of sunitinib in children diagnosed with 
advanced unresectable GIST. 
Patient eligibility: Eligible patients were ≥6 and <21 years of age, with histological diagnosis of GIST 
with  non-mutant  KIT  and  demonstrated  disease  progression  or  intolerance  to  imatinib  mesylate  or 
could not obtain imatinib in their country.  
Treatment: The starting dose of sunitinib was 15 mg/m2 per day administrated orally on Schedule 4/2 
(4  weeks  on  treatment  followed  by  2  weeks  off  treatment)  for  a  maximum  of  18  cycles,  which  was 
lower than the approved 50 mg/day on Schedule 4/2 dosing regimen in adults. The starting dose was 
based  on  the  Phase  1  study  ADVL0612  conducted  in  patients  with  solid  tumor  aged  2-21  years. 
Intrapatient dose escalation of sunitinib was allowed after completion of Cycle 1.  
Objectives/endpoints:  primary  objective  was  to  characterize  PK  profile  of  sunitinib  and  its  active 
metabolite  SU012662  in  children  and  young  adults  with  advanced  unresectable  GIST,  primary 
endpoints were The primary study endpoints were the PK parameters [including AUC24 (total plasma 
exposure  [AUC  from  0  to  24  hrs])  and  oral  clearance  (CL/F)].  Secondary  objectives  were  whether 
doses  greater  than  the  established  paediatric  maximum  tolerated  dose  (MTD)  were  tolerated,  safety 
and  antitumor  activity,  PK-PD  relationships,  in  paediatric  patients  with  GIST.  Among  the  secondary 
endpoints, ORR, DOR, PFS and OS were collected.      
No interim analysis was planned in this study.  
Sample  size:  The  sample  size  was  reduced  from  the  originally  planned  15  patients  to  6  patients 
because  of  the  rarity  of  the  disease  and  the  difficulties  in  identifying  pediatric  patients  suitable  for 
participation in the study. The revised sample size was expected to still allow characterization of the PK 
profile, ie, analysis of the primary endpoint. 
Results 
Study A6181196 started on 12 June 2012 and was completed on 21 August 2017.  
Patient  disposition:  A  total  of  6  patients  aged  13  to  16  years  were  enrolled  in  the  study  and  were 
included in the analysis of PK, safety, and efficacy (see table below).

7.2.  Case series Reports 
Retrospective analyses of medical records from paediatric and young adult patients with GIST treated 
with sunitinib from 3 case-series publications have been identified and presented by the MAH (Agaram 
et al. 20081, Janeway et al. 20092, Rutkowski et al. 20173), for a total of 20 paediatric patients.    
Methods – analysis of data submitted, and Results 
Agram et al (2008)  
This publication concerns a clinic-biological study of 17 patients with a diagnosis of GIST who were 18 
years  of  age  or  younger  that  were  identified  from  the  Memorial  Sloan-Kettering  Cancer  Center 
database.  
Among  them,  4  patients  received  sunitinib  treatment,  after  failure  of  or  intolerance  to  imatinib. 
Patient’s age was 10-18 years.  
Patients  were  assessed  by  CT/PET  according  to  local  standard  practice,  and  the  overall  tumour 
assessment evaluations were reported.  
The  major  purpose  of  the  study  was  to  compare  the  tumour  samples  with  adult  patients’  samples 
regarding KIT or PDGFRα mutations and pathway activation, as well as in vitro sensitivity to TKIs. 
Neither  precise  data on  tumour  assessment  at  baseline,  nor  precise  scheme  of  dosing were  available 
for all patients (Schedule 4/2 or continuous daily dosing schedule). 
PR,  SD  and  PD  was  achieved  by  one  patient  each.  No  data  on  tumor  response  is  available  for  one 
patient who developed sunitinib intolerance after one month and could not resume therapy (see table 
below).

Janeway et al (2009) 
This  publication  describes  7  paediatric  patients,  6  of  which  with  confirmed  metastatic  or  relapsed 
GIST that were treated with sunitinib within the Expanded Access Program (Pfizer A6181036 protocol) 
after previous failure to imatinib. Patient’s age was 10-17 years. 
Six out of seven patients had available disease measure by CT at the time of enrolment. Response to 
prior imatinib therapy was SD in 3 patients and PD in 3 patients. All patients had been off prior therapy 
for over 2 weeks when sunitinib was started. 
For the 6 patients with evaluable data on dose, the mean starting dose was 24.6 mg/m2 (range 17.7-
34.2).  In  3  out  of  6  patients  the  dose  was  increased  (range  29.9-40.4  mg/m2).  In  2 patients  where 
dose  was  increased  to  40.4  and  30.9  mg/m2  respectively,  the  dose  had  to  be  decreased  ultimately 
because  of  AE.  The  mean  cumulative  daily  dose  (the  mean  daily  dose  over  all  cycles)  on  this  4/2 
schedule was 26.8 mg/m2/d (range 17-6-34.1 mg/m2).   
One  patient  had  a  PR  (resolution  of  lung  metastasis),  5 patients  SD,  and  1 patient  showed  PD  on 
sunitinib therapy (see table below). The duration of PR or SD was 7 - >21 months, with an average of 
15  months.  In  5  out  of  6  patients  with  SD/PR,  sunitinib  resulted  in  a  longer  TTP  than  was  achieved 
during  imatinib  treatment,  difference  in  TTP  ranging  from  2  to  17  months.  Two  patients  with  SD 
showed a significant reduction in tumour metabolic activity on FDG-PET imaging.

Rutkowski et al (2017) 
This  publication  describes  9  paediatric/young  adult  patients,  aged  11-21  years,  with  GIST  and 
treated with sunitinib. Those patients were identified from clinical records from 2 centers in Europe and 
1 center in the US. 
There were no mutations in neither KIT nor PDGFRα for any patient.     
Before  being  treated  with  sunitinib,  8  patients  were  treated  with  surgery  and  8  patients  did  receive 
imatinib.  On  imatinib,  all  but  one  patient  had  SD  as  the  best  response,  and  8  out  of  9  patients  had 
documented PD.   
Sunitinib dosing regimens varied with 5 patients treated with Schedule 4/2 using a standard approved 
dosage of 50 mg/day while other patients received 37.5 mg/day in an alternative continuous regimen.  
Four patients started with Schedule 4/2 and moved to continuous dosing, mostly because of AEs. The 
mean  treatment  duration  was  23  months  (range  1->73).  Two  patients  were  still  on  therapy  as  per 
data cut-off of 20 February 2016 (>42 and > 73 months).    
The  objective  response  of  GIST  to  sunitinib  therapy  was  evaluated  with  serial  CT  scans  (performed 
every  2-3  months)  according  to  RECIST.  In  accordance  with  the  PDCO  request,  the  raw  data  on 
tumour  measurements  for  4  of  the  patients  included  in  this  publication  have  been  retrospectively 
collected.    
A best response of SD was observed in 7 of the 9 patients on sunitinib treatment (see table below). All 
but 1 patient eventually had PD. Among the 8 patients who progressed, PFS and TTP duration ranged 
from 1 to 28 months, while 1 patient remained progression free after 73 months (as per date of data 
cut-off). Overall, median PFS was 15 months. 
FU  in  this  publication  ranged  from  25  months  to  260  months.  At  the  time  of  data  cut  off,  8  patients 
remained  alive  with  disease  (AWD),  with  2  being  still treated  with  sunitinib, 4  are  being  treated  with 
other targeted agents, and 2 patients have stopped treatment. One patient died of disease during the 
course of therapy.

7.3.  Discussion – Clinical Efficacy 
Gastrointestinal  stromal  tumours  (GIST)  are  rare  mesenchymal  tumours  that  arise  in  the 
gastrointestinal  tract  (stomach  in  60%  of  the  cases),  more  often  occurring  in  the  adult  ageing 
population. Paediatric patients with GIST represent an even rarer sub population (1%-2% of all GIST 
cases),  presenting  a  different  clinical  behavior  and  biology  than  typical  adult  GIST.  Paediatric  GIST 
patients tend to be predominantly female, with a median age at diagnosis in most series of 14 years. 
Mutations  in  KIT  or  PDGFRá  are  uncommon,  negative  immunohistochemistry  for  any  of  the  SDH-
proteins are common (SDH-B mostly). Despite multiple recurrences and lack of dramatic responses to 
TKI  therapy,  most  paediatric  patients  survive  with  active  disease  for  many  years,  suggesting  a  more 
indolent clinical course than observed with adult GIST. Pediatric patients with metastatic WT GIST can 
survive  as  long  as  15  years  from  the  development  of  metastatic  disease  (Mullassery  et  al  20164, 
4 Mullassery D, Weldon CB. Pediatric/“Wildtype” gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Semin Pediatr Surg. 2016 Oct;25(5):305-310.

Janeway et al 20125). 
There  is  currently  no  consensus  in  the  paediatric  oncology  expert  community  on  which  compound  to 
use  in  metastatic  disease  or  recurrent  tumours:  systemic  treatment  with  TKI  is  recommended.  The 
choice  of  which  compound  to  use  is  under  debate  and  depends  on  the  presence  of  mutations  and 
clinical factors. 
In  adult  patients  with  GIST,  Sutent  is  currently  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  unresectable  and/or 
metastatic malignant disease after failure of imatinib treatment due to resistance or intolerance. 
The  MAH  has  presented  the  results  of  the  clinical  study  A6181196  of  sunitinib  in  pediatric  GIST 
patients. In addition, data coming from three case series have been provided.  
Study A6181196  
Study A6181196 was a single-arm, multi-center, multi-national, Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating the 
PK,  safety,  and  preliminary  anti-tumour  efficacy  of  sunitinib  in  children  and  young  adults  diagnosed 
with  advanced  unresectable  GIST.  The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  characterization  of  PK 
profile.  
A total of 8 patients were screened, of which 6 patients aged 6-16 years (median 14.0 years) were 
enrolled  in  the  study  and  were  included  in  the  analysis  of  PK,  safety,  and  efficacy.  Patients 
demonstrated  disease  progression  or  intolerance  to  imatinib  mesylate  or  could  not  obtain  imatinib  in 
their country. All patients had no detectable alterations in KIT and PDGFRα. 
The starting dose of sunitinib was 15 mg/m2 per day administered orally per Schedule 4/2, based on 
previously  identified  MTD  in  children  (in  phase  I  study  ADVL0612),  for  up  to  18  cycles  (24  months). 
Intra-patient dose escalation was  allowed after completion of Cycle 1,  not to exceed 50 mg/day. The 
dose was increased to 22.5 mg/m2 per day in 5 of the 6 patients, and a further increase to 30 mg/m2 
per day in 2 patients. Dose reduction due to an AE is reported in one patient (see safety).  
Patients  were  to  be  followed  for  OS  until  either  2  years  from  the  first  dose  of  the  study  drug  or 
completion of 18 cycles of study treatment. 
In  study  A6181196,  there  were  no  confirmed  objective  responses.  SD  was  reported  in  3  (50%) 
patients,  and  objective  disease  progression  was  observed  in  3  patients  (50%).  Since  none  of  the 
patients experienced a CR or PR, an analysis of DOR was not performed.   
PFS events were reported in 4 (66.7%) patients, for an estimated median PFS of 5.8 months (95% CI: 
2.3, NR).  
No deaths were reported after a follow-up survival period ranging from 0.9 to 2.4 years, therefore all 
patients were censored, and OS was not summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method. 
Case series reports 
The efficacy results from the 6 paediatric patients with GIST treated with sunitinib in Study A6181196 
were supported by published efficacy results from 20 sunitinib-treated paediatric or young adult 
patients with GIST retrieved in literature. Nearly all of whom were previously treated with imatinib.  
In the publication by Agram et al (2008), 4 patients aged 10-18 years with wild type KIT and PDGFRá 
GIST received sunitinib treatment after failure of or intolerance to imatinib. Overall tumour assessment 
evaluations  according  to  local  standard  practice  were  reported,  although  neither  precise  data  on 
tumour  assessment  at  baseline,  nor  precise  scheme  of  dosing  were  available  for  all  patients.  PR,  SD 
and PD was achieved by one patient each. No data on tumor response is available for one patient who 
developed sunitinib intolerance after one month and could not resume therapy.

GIST, while data is not available for the other two patients. For the 6 patients with evaluable data on 
dose, the mean starting dose was 24.6 mg/m2 (range 17.7-34.2). In 3 out of 6 patients the dose was 
increased (range 29.9-40.4 mg/m2), and in 2 of them the dose had to be decreased ultimately because 
of AE. One patient had a PR (resolution of lung metastasis) and 5 patients SD, and 1 patient showed 
PD for a duration of PR/SD of 7 - >21 months (average 15 months). In 5 out of 6 patients with SD/PR, 
sunitinib  resulted  in  a  longer  TTP  than  was  achieved  during  imatinib  treatment.  One  patient 
experienced PD as best overall response.  
In the publication by Rutkowski et al (2017), 9 paediatric/young adult patients, aged 11-21 years, with 
wild  type  KIT  and  PDGFRá  GIST,  are  described.  Eight  patients  did  receive  imatinib  before  sunitinib. 
Five  patients  were  treated  with  sunitinib  50  mg/day  on  schedule  4/2,  while  other  patients  received 
37.5 mg/day in an alternative continuous regimen. Four patients started with Schedule 4/2 and moved 
to continuous dosing, mostly because of AEs. Seven patients experienced SD and 2 patients had PD as 
best  response.  One  patient  died  of  disease  during  the  course  of  therapy.  All  but  one  patients  having 
SD,  eventually  experienced  PD.  PFS  and  TTP  duration  ranged  from  1  to  28  months,  while  1  patient 
remained  progression  free  after  73  months  (as  per  date  of  data  cut-off).  Overall,  median  PFS  is  15 
months. At the time of the data cut-off, two patients were still receiving sunitinib.   
The  starting  dose  of  sunitinib  in  the  two  case  series  that  include  data  on  dosage  (i.e.  Janeway  and 
Rutkowski)  appered  higher  compared  to  the  RP2D  of  15  mg/m2  identified  in  the  ADVL0612  Phase  1 
study. 
Of  note,  the 2  partial  responses  reported  in literature  (one in  Agram  et  al, described  as  resolution  of 
liver metastases, and one in Janeway et al, reported as resolution of lung metastases) were considered 
by  the  MAH  as  SDs,  in  the  absence  of  raw  data  and/or  confirmation  by  RECIST.  Therefore,  taking 
together,  evidence  from  Study  A6181196  and  the  3  case-series  indicated  that  sunitinib  treatment 
resulted  in  disease  stabilization  in  18  of  26  (69.2%)  paediatric  or  young  adult  patients  with  GIST, 
either  after imatinib  failure  or  intolerance  (16  out  of  21,  76%),  or  de  novo/after  surgery  (2 out of  5, 
40%).  
Due  to  the  lack  of  objective  confirmed  radiological  responses,  the  limited  number  of  patients  in  the 
clinical trial, the intrinsic limitation of retrospective case series, along with the very indolent nature of 
GIST in paediatric patients, it is considered that the available evidence are not conclusively supporting 
the clinical activity of sunitinib in children with GIST.  
8.  Clinical Safety aspects 
The MAH presented safety data for sunitinib in children with refractory solid tumours, supported by the 
3  clinical  studies  performed  in  paediatric  patients  (see  table  below).  No  combined  or  integrated 
analyses  of  safety  across  studies were  planned  or  performed  due  to  different  disease  type,  different 
treated populations and the different dosing regimens studied. Overall, safety data from 70 paediatric 
patients have been reported in the submitted dossier.

when given on the recommended adult schedule 
of QD for 28 days followed by 14 days with no 
study drug. 
Total patients: 35 
Safety Population:

The study included 3 parts: 
Part A (inter-patient dose escalation): The 
starting dose was 20 mg/m2/QD with dose levels 
for subsequent groups of patients as follows: 20, 
30, or 40 mg/m2/QD.  If the MTD had been 
exceeded at the first dose level, then the 
subsequent cohort of patients were treated at a 
dose of 15 mg/m2/QD. 
Part B (inter-patient dose escalation): The 
starting dose was 15 mg/m2/QD with dose levels 
for subsequent groups of patients as follows: 15, 
20, or 30 mg/m2/QD.  Subjects in Part B of the 
study had not received prior anthracycline 
treatment or cardiac radiation exposure (after 
observing cardiac related dose limiting toxicity 
(DLTs) in Part A of the study). 
Part C: All patients treated in Part C received the 
recommended dose determined in Part B.  
Patients in Part C took each sunitinib dose using 
the powder contained within sunitinib capsules 
sprinkled onto 5 mL of applesauce or yogurt per 
capsule.  
Sunitinib 15 mg/m2 /QD for 28 days followed by 
a 14 day rest period as capsules in 6-week cycles. 
Sunitinib was to be taken at approximately the 
same time each day for a maximum of 18 cycles 
(approximately 2 years) in the absence of disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity.

8.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted  
Patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment in Study A6181196, Study ADVL0612, and 
Study  ACNS1021  were  included  in  the  evaluation  of  safety.  In  all  the  3  studies,  safety  endpoints 
included  adverse  events  (AEs),  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs),  deaths,  laboratory  evaluations,  vital 
signs, concomitant medication use, and electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram results. 
In Study ACNS1021, Grade 3 or higher AEs, SAEs, and deaths were actively collected during the study.  
Although not required by the protocol, Grade <3 AEs may also have been reported.  All reported AEs 
(any grade) were included in the AE summaries. 
All AEs (serious and non-serious) that occurred on or after the first day of study treatment and up to 
28 days after the last sunitinib dose for Studies A6181196 and ADVL0612 and up to 30 days for Study 
ACNS1021 were considered as treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs).   
All AEs were coded by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) using Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 20.0 in Studies A6181196 and ACNS1021, and Version 15.1 in 
Study  ADVL0612.  Intensity  (severity)  of  the  AEs  was  graded  according  to  the  Common  Terminology 
Criteria  for  Adverse  Events  (CTCAE)  Version  4.0  in  all  3  studies.  Haematology  and  blood  chemistry 
data were graded according to NCI CTCAE version 4.0 severity grade, if applicable. 
In  Study  ADVL0612,  in  addition  to  the  AEs,  dose-limiting  toxicity  (DLT),  and  the  maximum  tolerated 
dose (MTD) were also evaluated as described below: 
1)  Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) 
DLT  is  defined  as  any  of  the  following  events  that  are  possibly,  probably  or  definitely  attributed  to 
sunitinib:  
-  Non-Hematological Dose-Limiting Toxicity: 
1.  Any Grade 4 non-hematological toxicity. 
2.  Any Grade 3 non-hematological toxicity with the specific exception of: 
•  Grade  3  nausea  and  vomiting  of  <3  days  duration  despite  appropriate  anti-emetic 
administration. 
•  Grade  3  ALT  or  AST  that  resolved  to  ≤Grade  2  within  7  days  of  study  drug  interruption  and 
that did not recur upon re-challenge with study drug.  Note: For the purposes of this study the 
ULN for ALT was defined as 45 U/L. 
•  Grade 3 bilirubin that resolved to Grade ≤2 within 7 days of study drug interruption and that 
did not recur upon re-challenge with study drug. 
•  Grade 3 fever or infection of <5 days duration. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/28241/2019  
Page 71/109 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Grade  3  hypophosphatemia,  hypokalemia,  hypocalcemia,  or  hypomagnesemia  responsive  to 
oral supplementation. 
•  Asymptomatic Grade 3 elevations in amylase or lipase that resolved to Grade <1 within 7 days 
of study drug interruption and that did not recur upon re challenge with study drug. 
3.  Left ventricular ejection fraction <50-40%, shortening fraction <24-15%, or an absolute decrease 
in shortening fraction of 8% points from baseline. 
4.  Grade  2  allergic  reactions  that  necessitated  discontinuation  of  study  drug  was  not  considered  a 
DLT. 
5.  A BP >25 mmHg above the 95% for age, height, and gender confirmed by repeated measurement 
was dose-limiting. 
6.  In patients on antihypertensive therapy, a persistently elevated BP, but ≤25 mmHg above the 95% 
for age, height, and gender for >14 days was dose-limiting. 
7.  Any Grade 2 non-hematological toxicity that persisted for ≥7 days and was considered sufficiently 
medically significant or sufficiently intolerable by patients that it required treatment interruption. 
8.  Any  AE  that  required  interruption  of  study  drug  for  >7  days  or  which  recurred  upon  drug 
re-challenge. 
-  Hematological Dose Limiting Toxicity: 
Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelet count <25,000/mm3) or Grade 4 neutropenia. 
2)  Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) 
The MTD was the maximum dose at which fewer than 1/3 of patients experienced a DLT during Cycle 1 
of therapy. In the event that 2 DLTs were observed out of 6 evaluable patients, but were of different 
classes  of  adverse  effects  (e.g.,  hepatotoxicity  and  myelosuppression),  expansion  of  the  cohort  to 
12 patients was considered if all of the following conditions were met: 
•  One of the DLTs did not appear to be related to dose (i.e., for at least 1 DLT, the same adverse 
effect,  attributed  to  study  drug,  was  not  previously  experienced  at  a  lower  dose  level  1 
increment below [in CTCAE grade or duration] the DLT definition). 
•  The adverse effect was readily reversible. 
•  The study chair, statistician, committee chair or vice chair, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program 
(CTEP),  and  Investigational  New  Drug  sponsor  all  agreed  that  expansion  of  the  cohort  was 
acceptable. 
If  less  than  1/3  of  patients  in  the  expanded  cohort  experienced  dose-limiting  toxicities,  the  dose 
escalation proceeded.     
For  Study ADVL0612,  additional  reporting  requirement  included  Secondary  Acute  Myeloid  Leukemia 
(AML)/ Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). 
8.2.  Results 
Exposure:  A  total  of  70  paediatric  and  young  adult  patients  received  at  least  1  dose  of  study 
medication  in  Studies  A6181196  (6  patients),  ADVL0612  (35  patients),  and  ACNS1021  (29  patients).

In study A6181196, the majority of the reported AEs were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Three patients had 
1 Grade 3 AE each, and 2 patients had 1 Grade 4 AE each. There were no reports of Grade 5 TEAEs. 
Overall, Headache (Grades 1 or 2) was reported in 4 (66.7%) patients and Diarrhoea (Grades 1 or 2), 
Nausea (Grade 1), Neutropenia (Grades 2 to 4), or white blood cell (WBC) count decreased (Grade 2) 
were  reported  in  3  patients  each,  respectively.  Hepatic  hematoma  and  Intra-abdominal  hemorrhage 
TEAEs (Grade 4) were reported in 1 patient. Both of these events were determined by the Investigator 
to  be  related  to  disease  progression.  This  conclusion  was  supported  by  laparotomy  showing  multiple 
lesions  localized  at  stomach  wall,  liver,  lymph  node  at  falx  hepatis,  and  massive  peritoneal 
dissemination, with hemorrhagic ascites. The other Grade 4 TEAE was Neutropenia that was reported 
in  1  patient  and 
led  to  dose  reduction.  Grade  3  TEAEs  reported  were  Hypoglycaemia, 
Hypophosphataemia, Neutropenia, and Thrombocytopenia.

Deaths:  
Study A6181196: no deaths were reported. 
Study ADVL0612: A total of 5 patients died during Part A of the study due to the disease under study 
(1  patient  in  the  15  mg/m2  and  4  in  the  20  mg/m2  dose  group)  and  none  of  the  deaths  were 
considered to be related to study treatment.   
A total of 5 patients died during Part B of the study due to the disease under study (3 patients in the 
sunitinib 15 mg/m2 and 2 patients in the sunitinib 20 mg/m2 dose group). One patient (a 6-years old 
girl  with  diffuse-pontine  glioma)  in  20  mg/m2  group  also  experienced  Grade  5  Aspiration.  The 
investigator assessed the causality of aspiration as possibly related to sunitinib stating the AE played a 
minor  contribution  to  death,  and  the  causality  of  the  death  was  reported  as  the  disease  under  study 
(Malignant glioma). The other deaths were not considered related to study treatment.  
A total of 5 patients died during the Part C of the study due to the disease under study and none of the 
deaths were considered to be related to study treatment. 
Study ACNS1021: A total of 18 patients died during the study, with 12 (75%) patients in glioma group 
and  6  (46.2%)  patients  in  ependymoma  group.  Five  (27.8%)  patients  died  during  active  treatment 
including up to 30 days after the last dose of the study drug. All 18 patients died due to the disease 
under study; none of the deaths were considered to be related to study treatment except for the death 
of 1 patient (4-years old boy with globlastoma multiforme) for which protocol therapy was considered 
to  have  had  a  “minor  contribution  to  death”.  The  investigator  stated  that  there  was  reasonable 
possibility  that  the  reported  AE  Heamorrhage  intracranial  grade  4  occurred  13  days  before  the  death 
was related to product sunitinib based on a plausible temporal association and the known safety profile 
of the drug. In addition, the AEs Hydrocephalus and Disease progression were unrelated to the study 
drug sunitinib, but related to deterioration of the underlying glioblastoma multiforme. The progressive 
disease, which was confirmed by the MRI might have contributed to Haemorrhage intracranial. 
Serious Adverse Events: 
Study A6181196: no SAEs were reported. 
Study  ADVL0612:  Overall,  18  patients  (51%)  experienced  SAEs.  A  summary  of  SAEs  is  reported  in

Study  ACNS1021:  Overall,  13  (44.8%)  patients  in  the  safety  population  had  all-causality  SAEs.  The 
most  common  (≥10%)  all-causality  SAEs  were  Haemorrhage  intracranial,  Hydrocephalus,  Neoplasm 
progression,  and  Seizure  (each  reported  for  3  [10.3%]  patients).  The  majority  of  the  SAEs  was 
associated  with  disease  under  study  and  considered  unrelated  to  study  treatment.  The  SAEs 
considered  treatment-related  were  intracranial  hemorrhage  (3  patients,  1  grade  1  and  2  grade  3 
events) and rash maculo-papular (1 patient, grade 2). Data on SAEs in presented in the table below:

Permanent discontinuations: 
Study A6181196: one patient was permanently discontinued during cycle 6 due to a treatment-related 
adverse event of Grade 2 Anaemia that was reported as resolved. 
Study  ADVL0612:  overall,  7  patients  (20%)  discontinued  due  to  AEs  related  to  study  drug,  and  the 
event was reported as “AE unspecified”.  
Study  ACNS1021:  two  patients  (7%)  discontinued  due  to  intracranial  hemorrhage,  reported  both  as 
SAE and considered related to study drug.  
Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) – Study ADVL0612: 
Part A: A total of 6 out of 12 patients experienced DLTs, with 3 (50.0%) patients each in the sunitinib 
15 mg/m2 and 20 mg/m2 dose groups. One of the first 3 patients in the sunitinib 20 mg/m2 dose group 
had  1  cardiac  event  (Grade  2  Left  ventricular dysfunction)  during  the  first treatment  cycle.  This  dose 
level was expanded to 6 patients, and 2 other patients reported DLTs in Cycle 1. A Grade 4 Neutrophil 
count  decreased  in  1  patient,  and  Grade  3  Fatigue,  Weight  decreased,  Decreased  appetite, 
Dehydration,  Hypokalemia  and  Hypophosphatemia  in  1  patient.  The  dose  was  then  reduced  to  15 
mg/m2. One of the first 3 patients in the sunitinib 15 mg/m2 dose group experienced 3 cardiac events 
(Grade 3 Cardiac failure, Grade 2 Acute coronary syndrome, and Grade 2 Left ventricular dysfunction) 
during  the  first  treatment  cycle.  The  dose  level  was  expanded  to  6  patients  and  2  other  patients 
experienced  DLTs  in  Cycle  1  (Grade  3  ALT  increased  in  1  patient  and  Grade  3  Hyponatraemia  in  1 
patient).  The  protocol  was  amended  to  exclude  patients  with  previous  anthracycline  or  cardiac 
radiation exposure. No maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was defined for the Part A population.

Part B: A total of 4 out of 11 patients experienced DLTs (2 out of 8 patients in the sunitinib 15 mg/m2 
group  and  2  out  of  3  patients  in  the  sunitinib  20  mg/m2  dose  groups;  any  cycle  DLTs).  None  of  the 
patients experienced cardiac events. None of the 8 patients in the sunitinib 15 mg/m2 dose group had 
DLTs in Cycle 1. Two patients in the sunitinib 15 mg/m2 dose group experienced DLTs in subsequent 
cycles, a Grade 3 nephrolithiasis during Cycle 5 in 1 patient, and Grade 4 Neutrophil count decreased 
and  Grade  2  QT  prolongation  during  Cycle  2  in  1  patient.  Two  out  of  3  patients  in  the  sunitinib  20 
mg/m2  dose  group  experienced  DLTs  during  the  first  treatment  cycle,  a  Grade  4  Hyperuricemia  in  1 
patient, and Grade 4 Haemorrhage intracranial, Grade 4 Vagus nerve disorder, and Grade 5 Aspiration 
in 1 patient.   
Based  on  Part  B  of  the  study,  The  MTD  and  the  RP2D  for  sunitinib  in  children  without 
previous  cardiac  radiation  or  anthracycline  exposure  was  15  mg/m2  QD  for  28  days 
followed by 14 days off treatment. 
Part  C:  A  total  of  6  out  of  12  patients  experienced  DLTs  (any  cycle)  in  the  sunitinib  15  mg/m2  dose 
group.    None  of  the  patients  experienced  cardiac  events.  In  the  first  treatment  cycle,  3  patients 
experienced  DLTs,  a  Grade  4  Haemorrhage  intracranial  and  Hypoxia  in  1  patient;  Grade  3  Palmar 
plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome in 1 patient; and Grade 3 Back pain and Dizziness in 1 patient. In 
Part C, there were 3 out of 12 patients with Cycle 1 DLT (25%) which was below the threshold of 33% 
for  Cycle  1  DLT  rate.  DLTs  in  later  cycles  were  captured,  but  not  used  in  determination  of 
recommended  phase  2  dose  (RP2D).  One  additional  patient  had  Grade  3  Abdominal  pain  and 
Pneumatosis  intestinalis  during  the  first  treatment  cycle.  Both  these  events  were  reported  as  DLT, 
though  they  were  considered  unlikely  related  to  the  study  drug.  Two  patients  experienced  DLTs  in 
subsequent  cycles,  a  Grade  3  Blood  alkaline  phosphatase  increased  during  Cycle  3  in  1  patient  and 
Grade 3 Proteinuria during Cycle 2 in 1 patient. 
Laboratory and other events: 
Study A6181196: Haemathology: Grade 4 neutrophils (absolute) decreased was reported in 1 (16.7%) 
patient, and Grade 3 neutrophils (absolute) decreased, platelets decreased, and anemia were reported 
in  1  (16.7%)  patient  each,  all  of  which  were  also  reported  as  TEAEs.  Grade  2  decrease  in  WBC, 
decrease  in  neutrophils  (absolute),  and  anaemia  were  reported  in  6  (100%),  4  (66.7%),  and  1 
(16.7%) patients, respectively.  
Chemistry:  The  majority  of  the  results  were  within  normal  range  (shown  as  Grade  0)  or  Grade  1  in 
severity, and there were  no Grade 4 chemistry laboratory abnormalities. Grade 3 hypoglycaemia and 
hypophosphataemia  were  reported  in  1  (16.7%)  patient  each,  both  of  which  were  also  reported  as 
TEAEs. 
Blood pressure: A change from baseline in diastolic blood pressure (BP) of ≥10 mm Hg was reported in 
5  (83.3%)  patients  and  ≥20  mm  Hg  in  3  (50.0%)  patients.  A  change  from  baseline  in  systolic  BP  of 
≥20 mm Hg was reported in 1 (16.7%) patient. Overall, the mean changes from baseline in BP during 
and  at  the  end  of  treatment  were  small  and  not  clinically  meaningful,  as  there  were  no  TEAEs  of 
Hypertension or BP increased reported in this study. 
QTc interval: Overall, mean changes from baseline in QTcB and QTcF interval during and at the end of 
treatment  were  small,  and  none  were  reported  as  AEs.  Shifts  in  QTcF  interval  from  Grade  0  (within 
normal  range)  at  baseline  to  Grade  ≥3  (QTcF  interval  ≥30  msec)  post-baseline  was  reported  in  2 
(33.3%) patients.    
Study  ADVL0612:  Hematology:  laboratory  abnormalities  were  reported  in  the  majority  of  patients  in 
the safety population. The majority of the events were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity. Three (50.0%)

patients in the 20 mg/m2 group of Part A and 1 (8.3%) patient in Part C had Grade 3 WBC decreased 
and anaemia. These events were reported as TEAEs. 
Chemistry:  laboratory  test  abnormalities  were  reported  in  the  majority  of  patients  in  the  safety 
analysis  population.  In  Part  A-Total,  hypophosphatemia  and  elevated  lipase  (Grade  3  and  Grade  2, 
respectively)  were  reported  in  1  (8.3%)  patient  each.  In  Part  B-Total,  hypophosphatemia  (Grade  3) 
was  reported  in  1  (9.1%)  patient,  and  elevated  creatinine  (Grade  2)  was  reported  in  2  (18.2%) 
patients.  In  Part  C,  elevated  lipase  (Grade  2)  was  reported  in  1  (8.3%)  patient.  Grade  3 
hypophosphatemia was also reported as TEAEs as described in Study ADVL0612 CSR Table 21 in Part 
A-Total and in Part B-Total. Grade 2 lipase increased was reported as a TEAE in Part C. 
QTc interval: In Part A of the study, 1 (16.7%) patient in the 15 mg/m2 group and 2 (33.3%) patients 
in  the  20  mg/m2  group  had  maximum  increases  between  30  msec  to  60  msec  from  baseline  in  QTc 
interval.    In  Part  B  of  the  study,  1  (12.5%)  patient  in  the  15  mg/m2  group  had  maximum  increase 
between 30 msec to 60 msec from baseline in QTc interval. In Part C of the study, 2 (16.7%) patients 
in  the  15  mg/m2  group  had  maximum  increase  between  30  msec  to  60  msec  from  baseline  in  QTc 
interval. 
Study  ACNS1021:  Hematology:  The  majority  of  patients  in  both  treatment  groups  had  haematology 
baseline  severities  of  Grade  0  or  Grade  1.    Seven  (7)  patients  had  haematology  laboratory 
abnormalities reported as AEs. Five patients overall had Grade 3 Neutrophil count decreased; 1 patient 
had  activated  partial  thromboplastin  time  prolonged,  and  1  patient  had  Grade  4  Neutrophil  count 
decreased,  Lymphocyte  count  decreased,  and  Grade  3  WBC  count  decreased.  Neutrophil  count 
decreased  (Grade  3  in  5  [17.2%]  patients  and  Grade  4  in  1  [3.4%]  patient);  Lymphocyte  count 
decreased (Grade 4 in 1 [3.4%] patient); and White blood cell count decreased (Grade 3 in 1 [3.4%] 
patient) were reported as TEAEs. 
Chemistry:  The  majority  of  patients  in  both  treatment  groups  had  chemistry  baseline  severities  of 
Grade 0 or Grade 1. Two patients had Grade 4 hypocalcemia; Grade 3 abnormalities were reported for 
ALT increased (3 patients), AST increased (2 patients), hypokalemia (1 patient), and elevated lipase (1 
patient).  
Safety data from the retrospective case series 
Agaram et al (2008): the manuscript does not offer a detailed review of the safety of the 4 patients. 
One  patient  stopped  sunitinib  treatment  after  1  month.  This  patient,  however,  was  intolerant  to 
imatinib.    Another  patient  stopped  treatment  after  5  months  due  to  drug  intolerance  and  disease 
progression. The other 2 patients continued on sunitinib treatment until disease progression.  
Janewy  et  al  (2009):  of  the  7  patients  described  (age  ranges  10  to  17  years),  no  Grade  4  or  5 
treatment-related  AEs  were  reported.  Three  Grade  3  events  (fatigue,  gastrointestinal  AEs, 
haematological)  occurred  in  2  of  7  patients.  These  Grade  3  AEs  led  to  dose  reductions  in  2  patients. 
Grade 1 or 2 events reported were: fatigue in 3 patients, haematological in 3 patients, gastrointestinal 
in 4 patients (including abdominal pain, vomiting, anorexia or diarrhoea); musculoskeletal events in 4 
patients (including creatinine kinase elevation in 1 patient); leg pain in 2 patients, and joint pain in 1 
patient.  Hair  hypopigmentation  in  4  patients;  headache  in  2  patients;  hypothyroidism  in  2  patients; 
hepatic dysfunction in 1 patient. 
Rutkowski et al (2017): of the 9 patients described (age ranges 11 to 21 years), the majority of AEs 
were  Grade  1  or  2  in  severity.  No  Grade  5  treatment-related  AEs  were  reported.  Grade  3  AEs 
(cholecystitis  [n=1],  hypothyroidism  and  anaemia  [n=1],  fatigue,  mucositis  and  diarrhoea  [n=1]) 
occurred in 3 patients. Two patients permanently discontinued treatment due to Grade 1/2 AEs (Grade

2  abdominal/bone  pain  and  fatigue  [n=1],  Grade  2  oedema  and  Grade  1  fatigue,  epistaxis,  and 
headache  [n=1]),  and  2  patients  required  dose  reduction.  Most  AEs  experienced  by  patients  treated 
with sunitinib were manageable and reversible after dose adjustments.   
Post-marketing data 
Use in paediatric patients is monitored and discussed in each PSUR. As of 30 April 2017, no new safety 
signals  with  regards  to  paediatric  use  have  been  identified.  Estimated  post-marketing  exposure  in 
children and adolescents under 18 years old is not available. During the 01 May 2016 through 30 April 
2017 interval, there were 43 cases which reported the use of sunitinib in the paediatric population. The 
most  common  AEs  (≥2)  in  paediatric  patients  included  the  following  PTs:  Disease  progression  (4), 
Fatigue, GIST, and Headache (2 each). These events are listed in the sunitinib SmPC or are consistent 
with progression of the underlying malignancy. 
8.3.  Discussion 
A  total  of  70 paediatric  and  young  adult  patients  received  at  least  1 dose  of  study  medication  in 
Studies A6181196 (6 patients), ADVL0612 (35 patients), and ACNS1021 (29 patients) were included in 
the evaluation of safety. Data have been presented separately for each study: the MAH did not present 
pooled  analyses  due  to  different  disease  type,  different  treated  populations  and  the  different  dosing 
regimens studied. 
The majority of patients in all 3 studies were white, with a prevalence of female in studies A6181196 
and ADVL0612, while more male were enrolled in ACNS1021 study. Mean age was 14.3 years (SD 1.4, 
range 13-16) in A6181196 study, 12 years (range 3-21) in ADVL0612 study, and 11.5 years (SD 4.6, 
range 3-19) in ACNS1021 study.  
Study ADVL0612: This is a phase I study to determine the MTD of sunitinib in children with refractory 
solid tumours when given on the recommended adult schedule 4/2.  
During the initial portion of the study (Part A, 20 mg/m2), 1 of first 3 subjects experienced 1 cardiac 
event during the first treatment cycle. This dose level was expanded to 6 subjects and 2 other subjects 
reported  DLTs in  Cycle  1. The  dose  was  then  reduced  to  15  mg/m2.  One  subjects in  this dose  group 
experienced  3  cardiac  events  during  the  first  treatment  cycle.  Therefore,  due  to  cardiac  DLTs,  the 
protocol  was  amended  to  exclude  subjects  with  previous  anthracycline  or  cardiac  radiation  exposure, 
which were not enrolled in the subsequent Part B of the study, and no further cardiac events occurred 
in part B. No MTD was defined for Part A population. None of the 8 subjects in the Part B sunitinib 15 
mg/m2  dose  group  had  DLTs  in  Cycle  1.  The  dose  was  escalated  to  20  mg/m2  with  2  out  of  first  3 
subjects  experiencing  DLTs  during  the  first  treatment  cycle.  These  results  established  15  mg/m2  per 
day  on  schedule  4/2  as  the  MTD  for  subjects  without  previous  cardiac  radiation  or  anthracycline 
exposure (which was lower as compared to adults, i.e. 15 mg/m2 versus 30 mg/m2). During Part C of 
the study (sunitinib 15 mg/m2, with sunitinib capsule contents sprinkled over applesauce or yogurt), 4 
out of 12 enrolled subjects experienced DLTs in the first treatment cycle. 
A total of 35 patients were enrolled in this study: across the three Parts of the trial, 26 subjects were 
treated  with  sunitinib  15  mg/m2  and  9  patients  were  treated  with  20  mg/m2.  The  median  number  of 
cycles started was 1 for all 3 parts of the study. Four patients overall had started ≥5 cycles.  
All the 35 patients evaluated experienced at least one TEAEs and at least one treatment-related TEAEs. 
Approximately  half  of  the  patients  experienced  a  SAE.  Grade  5  AEs  were  reported  in  6  patients:  of 
them,  only  one  Grade  5  AE,  occurred  in  a  6-years  old  girl  with  diffuse-pontine  glioma  in  Part  B  (20 
Assessment report

mg/m2), was reported to be treatment-related. The investigator assessed the causality of aspiration as 
possibly related to sunitinib, stating the AE played a minor contribution to death, and the causality of 
the  death  was  reported  as  the  disease  under  study.  According  to  the  National  Cancer  Institute  CTEP 
(Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program) assessment, the grade 5 aspiration was considered unrelated to 
sunitinib  and  related  to  the  glioma  and  to  disease  progression.  All  the  other  deaths  occurred  in  the 
study were not considered related to sunitinib.  
Overall, in Part A of the study, the most frequent all causality TEAEs, mainly of Grade 1 or Grade 2 in 
severity  were  decreased  platelet  count  and  WBC,  decreased  neutrophil  count  and  increased  ALT 
(decreased neutrophil count mainly of severity Grade 3 or 4). In Part B of the study, the most frequent 
all  causality  TEAEs,  mainly  of  Grade  1  or  Grade  2  in  severity  were  hypertension,  hypophosphatemia, 
diarrhea,  vomiting,  decreased  WBC  count,  decreased  neutrophil,  and  increased  AST.  In  Part  C  of  the 
study,  the  most  frequent  all  causality  TEAEs,  mainly  of  Grade  1  or  Grade  2  in  severity  were  fatigue, 
anemia,  hypermagnesemia,  decreased  lymphocyte,  decreased  neutrophil,  decreased  WBC  count,  and 
increased ALT. 
Study A6181196: This is a phase I/II study of sunitinib in young patients with advanced GIST. Starting 
dose of sunitinib was 15 mg/m2 per day on schedule 4/2 for up to 18 cycles (24 months). A total of 6 
patients received at least 3 cycles of the study treatment and 1 patient received all 18 of the planned 
cycles. Overall, the median duration of treatment was 219 days (i.e. 7.3 months) and the mean daily 
dose  (SD)  was  27.12  (7.192)  mg.  The  dose  was  increased  to  22.5  mg/m2  per  day  in  5  of  the  6 
patients,  and  a  further  increase  to  30  mg/m2  per  day  in  2  patients.  Dose  reduction  due  to  an  AE  is 
reported in one patient.  
All  6 patients  in  the  safety  population  experienced  at  least  one  TEAE  and  at  least  one  treatment-
related  TEAEs.  AEs  of  Grade  3  or  4  were  reported  in  5 patients,  of  them  4  patients  (66.7%)  had 
Grades 3  or  4  treatment−related  TEAEs.  No  Grade  5  TEAEs  were  reported.  In  all  6 patients,  at  least 
1 TEAE and treatment-related AE were reported in the SOC Blood and lymphatic system disorders. The 
most commonly reported treatment-related TEAEs were diarrhea, Headache, Nausea, Neutropenia and 
WBC  count  decreased  in  3 (50.0%)  patients  each,  the  majority  being  Grade  1-2.  Grade 3 
Hypophosphatemia,  Neutropenia,  and  Thrombocytopenia  were  reported  in  1 (16.7%) patient  each. 
Grade 4  Neutropenia  was  reported  in  1 patient.  Not  deaths  or  SAE  were  reported  in  this  study.  One 
patient permanently discontinued due to Grade 2 anemia.    
Study  ACNS1021:  This  is  a  phase  II  study  of  sunitinib  in  recurrent,  refractory  or  progressive  High 
Grade  Glioma  and  Ependymoma  in  paediatric  and  young  adult  patients.  This  study  was  prematurely 
closed  due  to  the  lack  of  disease  control.  The  safety  population  included  29  subjects:  of  them,  13 
(44.8%)  had  all-causality  SAEs,  the  most  common  (≥10%)  being  Haemorrhage  intracranial, 
Hydrocephalus,  Neoplasm  progression,  and  Seizure  (each  reported  for  3  [10.3%]  patients).  Most 
common  treatment-related  TEAEs  were  neutrophil  count  decrease  (20.7%,  6  events  all  Grade  3-4), 
intracranial haemorrage (10.3%, 3 patients having one grade 1, one grade 3 and one grade 4 events), 
amylase  increase  and  fatigue  (both  6.9%).  A  total  of  18  patients  died  during  the  study:  for  one  of 
which  protocol  therapy  was  considered  to  have  had  a  “minor  contribution  to  death”,  due  to  an 
intracranial  haemorrage  developed  13  days  before death.  Intracranial  haemorrage  was  also the  most 
common  SAE  (3  events,  all  considered  treatment  related).  Cerebral  haemorrage  (including  fatal 
events)  is  a  known  ADR  for  sutent,  but  with  frequency  “uncommon”.  The  relative  high  rate  of 
intracranial haemorrage in the pediatric CNS tumor setting has been highlighted in the SmPC.       
Safety  data  from  the  retrospective  case  series  in  GIST:  In  Janeway  et  al  (7  patients),  the  more 
commonly  reported  AEs  were  fatigue,  haematoological  and  GI  events.  In  the  9  patients  described  by 
Rutkowski,  the  grade  3  events  reported  were  cholecystitis,  hypothyroidism  and  anaemia,  fatigue,

mucositis and diarrhoea in 3 patients overall. No grade 4 and 5 treatment related AEs were reported in 
both studies. No safety data have been collected in the Agaram manuscript (4 patients). 
Post-marketing data: post-marketing data revealed that Sutent use has been reported in the paediatric 
population.  The  MAH  stated  that  no  new  safety  signals  with  regards  to  paediatric  use  have  been 
identified.  
Although  the  MAH  considered  sunitinib  to  be  well  tolerated  in  the  paediatric  population,  it  should  be 
noted the high rate of grade 3-4 treatment related events reported across the studies (e.g. 66.7% in 
study A6181196; 88.3%, 45.5% and 50% in Part A, B and C of Study ADVL0612 respectively, 34.5% 
in  Study  ACNS1021),  indicating  that  the toxicity  of the  agent  is  not  negligible.  Information  regarding 
ADR reported from the available paediatric studies has been included in the SmPC.   
Based  on  the  data  provided,  several  TEAEs  of electrolyte  disturbances,  also  with  high  severity  grade, 
have been reported across clinical trials with sunitinib in children reported also as related to sunitinib. 
The  MAH  was  requested  to  discuss  this  finding.  The  MAH  reviewed  the  TEAEs  of  electrolyte 
disturbances  occurred  in  paediatric  studies,  reporting  that  9/70  (13%)  patients  reported  11  Grade  3 
TEAEs [hypophosphatemia (4), hyperkalaemia (3), hyponatraemia (2), hypokalaemia (2)]; 6/11 were 
considered probably  or  possibly  related to  sunitinib,  and  3/6 of  them  were  serious  and  resolved.  The 
three  SAEs  (hypophosphatemia,  hypokalaemia,  hyponatraemia)  were  considered  confounded  by 
advanced primary tumor and paraneoplastic syndrome (SIADH). In study ACNS1021, the 3 episodes of 
electrolyte disturbances reported (G4 hypocalcemia (2 episodes) and G3 hypokaliemia (1 event)) were 
reported  on  laboratory  values  and  not  as  TEAE,  and  no  further  information  regarding  possible 
relationship  with  study  drug  as  evaluated  by  investigator  are  available.  Hypophosphatemia  has  been 
reported in 4.8 section as Grade 3 ADR recorded in A6181196 study. Based on the data provided, no 
further information is considered needed in the SmPC.   
9.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are being updated.  
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information. 
9.1.  User consultation 
The  MAH  was  previously  requested  by  the  CHMP  (procedure  EMEA/H/C/000687/II/0065)  to  perform 
and to submit a new user testing in the next relevant variation. The MAH submitted the results of the 
readability testing.  
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
MAH show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.

3.  Possible  consequences  of  modelling  underestimation  of  sunitinib,  SU012662,  and  total  active 
moieties exposures from a safety point of view should be discussed.  
4.  All the simulated exposure measures of sunitinib and SU012662 were done following 15mg/m2 
daily oral administration of sunitinib, however the proposed dosage to be included in the SmPC 
is  20mg/m2  daily.  Therefore  the  MAH  is  requested  to  perform  the  same  simulation  and  the 
same comparison with the observed data also with 20mg/m2 daily dosage in order to directly 
compare the simulated exposure of the proposed dosage to be reported on the SmPC and the 
observed paediatric data.  
5.  An in depth discussion on the proposed dose reported in the SmPC is needed: 
a)  Population  PK  and  PK-PD  analysis  (PMAR-EQDD-A618w-Other-366,  using  pooled  data  from 
paediatric  and  adult  patients)  conclusions:  Based  on  the  PK,  safety,  and  efficacy  trial 
simulation results, a starting dose of ~15 mg/m2/day appears to be inadequate; however, a 
starting dose of ~25 mg/m2/day is predicted to be more appropriate in pediatric patients 
with  GIST  and  provides  comparable  plasma  drug  exposures,  and  subsequently  safety,  and 
efficacy to those in adult patients with GIST treated at 50 mg/day on Schedule 4/2. Although 
the starting dose of 15 mg/m2 was selected as the starting dose for the GIST pediatric study 
A6181196,  based  on  the  Phase  1  data  from  heavily  pre-treated  pediatric  patients  with  CNS 
tumours  (solid  tumours),  the  option  for  intra-patient  dose  escalation  to  22.5  mg/m2  and 
subsequently  to  30  mg/m2  was  allowed  to  ensure  maximum  plasma  drug  exposure  for  each 
individual patient; 
b)  Population  PK  analysis  (PMAR-EQDD-A618b-DP4-846,  using  data  from  paediatric  patients) 
conclusions: Based on the final PK model predictions, a sunitinib dose of approximately 20 
mg/m2/day in paediatric patients with GIST aged 6-17 years would be expected to lead to 
similar total plasma exposures for sunitinib and SU012662 as compared to adult patients with 
GIST on 50 mg/day, on Schedule 4/2; 
c)  PBPK  analysis  conclusions:  Based  on  the  simulated  exposures  in  different  ages  groups  of 
paediatrics  patients,  the  sunitinib  dose  that  will  lead  to  predicted  steady-state  total  plasma 
Assessment report

exposure over the dosing interval (i.e. steady-state AUC) similar to what has been observed in 
adults  with  GIST  (1233  ng•hr/mL  for  sunitinib,  551  ng•hr/mL  for  SU012662,  and  1822 
ng•hr/mL for the total active moieties) at 50 mg once daily (QD) is 17 mg/m2, 20 mg/m2, 
and  24  mg/m2  for  sunitinib;  28  mg/m2,  27  mg/m2,  and  26  mg/m2  for  SU012662;  20 
mg/m2,  22  mg/m2,  and  25  mg/m2  for  the  total  active  moieties,  respectively,  for  the  age 
groups 2 to 5, 6 to 11, and 12 to 17 years old. 
d)  In the Summary of Clinical Pharmacology Studies 25 mg/m2/day and 20 mg/m2/day are 
reported  into  two  different  sections  as  dose  predicted  to  provide  comparable  sunitinib 
exposure to those in adult patients with GIST treated at 50 mg QD on schedule 4/2. 
e)  The  MTD  calculated  in  study  ADVL0612  was  lower  compared  to  the  doses  reported  above: 
MDT  for  pediatric  patients  without  previous  exposure  to  anthracyclines  or  cardiac  irradiation 
was indeed established to be 15 mg/m2 schedule 4/2. Although the MAH noted that in some 
cases  patients  were  able  to  escalate  sunitinib  dose  (e.g.  in  study  A6181196),  there  is  a 
concern of safety with doses higher than the MTD. The MAH should take this data into account 
in its discussion.    
Given  all  the  above  considerations,  the  indication  of  the  dose  appears  confounding,  therefore, 
further discussion and analyses are requested.    
Clinical safety 
6.  Based  on 
the  data  provided,  several  TEAEs  of  electrolyte  disturbances 
(i.e., 
hypo/hypercalcemia, 
hypophosphatemia, 
hypo/hyperkaliemia, 
hyponatriemia, 
hypermagnesemia), also with high severity grade, have been reported across clinical trials with 
sunitinib in children (e.g. in Study A6181196: hypophosphatemia G3; in Study ADVL0612, G3 
hyponatriemia, G3 hypophosphatemia, G3 hyperkaliemia; in study ACNS1021 hypocalcemia G4 
and hyponatriemia G3). In various cases they are reported as related to sunitinib. It is noted 
that  no  electrolyte  imbalances  are  reported  as  ADR  of  sunitinib  in  the  SmPC  section  4.8.  The 
MAH should discuss this finding, and evaluate how to eventually reflect relevant information for 
paediatric patients in the SmPC.

covariates considered in building the population PK-PD model, if different compared to the population 
PK model. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
For  the  integrated  population  PK-PD  analyses  of  safety  endpoints  in  pediatric and  adult  patients  with 
GIST  and  solid  tumors,  the  data  collected  from  Studies  248-ONC-0511-002,  RTKC-0511-005,  RTKC-
0511-016,  and  RTKC-0511-018  in  adult  patients  with  solid  tumors;  Study  ADVL0612  in  pediatric 
patients with solid tumors; and Studies A6181004, A6181045, A6181047, and RTKC-0511-013 in adult 
patients with GIST were pooled.  However, for the efficacy, only the studies in patients with GIST were 
included (PMAR-EQDD-A618w-Other-366 PKPD – Published Part A Section 3).  
All  the  available  safety  data  from  Study  ADVL0612  were  included  in  the  PK-PD  analyses  for  safety 
endpoints. However, for efficacy, the PK-PD modeling for the Sum of the Longest Diameters (SLD) only 
included  adult  GIST  data.  This  approach  is  consistent  with  the  key  binding  elements  included  in 
Measure  #3  of  the  approved  Pediatric  Investigational  Plan  (PIP)  in  which  it  was  specified  to  only 
perform the PK-PD modeling using SLD data in adult patients with GIST. However, to further confirm 
the efficacy predictions in pediatric patients with GIST, the predictions were compared to the available 
literature  efficacy  data  from  Janeway  et  al  and  Agaram  et  al  (PMAR-EQDD-A618w-Other-366  PKPD – 
Published Part A Section 6.4).  
The descriptive statistics for the subject baseline characteristics and covariates considered in building 
the final PK-PD models for each PK-PD endpoint are provided in Table 1. Therefore, with the exception 
of Tumor Type effect for the efficacy endpoint SLD, all the covariates listed in Table 1 were examined 
in building the PK-PD models for safety and efficacy endpoints.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has clarified the use of ADVL0612 study data for the PK/PD model: data from this study were 
included  only  for  safety  endpoints.  The  descriptive  statistics  for  the  subjects  baseline  characteristics 
from  study  ADVL0612  have  not  been  provided,  however  it  has  been  found  in  the  study  report  body 
submitted for a previous variation application.

Question 2  
Considering  the  importance  of  the  BSA  values,  the  MAH  is  request  to  add  a  reference  also  to  BSA 
values in the proposed text on SmPC. 
Summary of the MAH’s response  
The  reference  to  the  BSA  range  of  1.1  to  1.87  m2  (PMAR-EQDD-A618b-DP4-846  Figures  25  and  26) 
has been now added to the SmPC Section 5.2 under Pediatric Population.

Following is reported the relative part of the SmPC, section 5.2, proposed as to be added: 
Furthermore,  based  on  an  integrated  population  PK  analysis  of  pooled  data  from  the  3  paediatric 
studies (2 pediatric solid tumor studies and 1 pediatric GIST study; ages: 6 years to 11 years and 12 
years to 17 years), baseline body surface area (BSA) was a significant covariate on apparent clearance 
of sunitinib and its active metabolite. Based on this analysis, a dose of approximately 20 mg/m2 daily 
(BSA  range:  1.10-1.87  m2)  in  paediatric  patients,  with  BSA  values  between  1.10  and  1.87  m2,  is 
expected  to  provide  plasma  exposures to  sunitinib  and  its  active  metabolite  comparable  (between 75 
and 125% of the AUC) to those in adults with GIST administered sunitinib 50 mg daily on Schedule 4/2 
(AUC 1233 ng.hr/mL). 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH agrees with EMA recommendation, and the BSA value has been added to Section 5.2 of the 
SmPC, subsection “Paediatric population”. 
Conclusion 
Issue  solved,  provided  that the changes to  the proposed text to be added in  section  5.2  of 
the SmPC will be implemented.  
Question 3 
SimCYP Simulation  
Possible consequences of modelling underestimation of sunitinib, SU012662, and total active moieties 
exposures from a safety point of view should be discussed. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
It  is important to  note  that  the  determined  pediatric  dose  of 20 mg/m2  was  based  on the integrated 
population  PK  analysis.  This  is  a  well-established  methodology  based  on  non-linear  mixed-effects 
modeling  (NONMEM)  and  it  allowed  the  development  of  a  parsimonious  PK  model  that  best 
fit/described the pediatric data in both solid tumors and GIST in order to derive the pediatric dose that 
achieves  comparable  systemic  exposures  to  those  in  adults  with  GIST.  Therefore,  the  observed 
potential  underestimation  of  predicted  concentrations  of  sunitinib,  SU012662,  and  total  drug  by  the 
SimCYP PBPK model would not be clinically relevant in relation to the determined dose of 20 mg/m2, 
which was based on the integrated population PK analysis.  
Unlike  the  integrated  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  approach  which  fit  a  PK  model  to  the 
clinically  observed  data  in  pediatrics,  the  SimCYP  PBPK  model  development  strategy  used  a  hybrid 
approach, the bottom up approach (ie, in vitro measured values) coupled with the top down approach 
(observed  pharmacokinetics  in  adults),  to  extrapolate  and  predict  the  plasma  exposures  in  pediatrics 
(SimCYP Report Section 3.1). As a result, a slight difference between the predicted exposures and the 
observed exposures in pediatrics would not be unexpected. Nevertheless, as requested by the CHMP, 
the  MAH  assessed  whether  this  difference  (ie,  underestimation  in  this  case)  would  alter  the  dose 
recommendation in the pediatrics, based on the SimCYP PBPK model.  
Assuming  an  approximate  15%  underestimation  of  SimCYP  exposures  (average  total  drug  AUC24 
underestimation,  SimCYP  Report  Section  4),  the  revised  projected  doses  based  on  SimCYP  (ie,  19 
mg/m2  for  6-11  years  and  21  mg/m2  for  12-17  years  instead  of  22  mg/m2  for  6-11  years  and  25 
mg/m2 for 12-17 years) would be even closer to the dose of 20 mg/m2 (ie, within approximately 5% 
instead  of  25%)  and  remain  consistent  with  and  confirming  the  dose  determined  by  the  integrated 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/28241/2019  
Page 97/109 
 
 
 
 
 
population  PK  analysis  (20  mg/m2).  Therefore,  in  both  scenarios,  the  dose  projections  by  SimCYP 
approach support the 20 mg/m2 dose determined by the integrated population PK analysis. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Based  on  SimCYP,  the  revised  projected  dose,  assuming  an  approximate  15%  of  SimCYP  exposure, 
remains consistent with dose determined by the integrated population PK analysis (20 mg/m2).  
Conclusion 
Issue resolved 
Question 4  
SimCYP Simulation 
All  the  simulated  exposure  measures  of  sunitinib  and  SU012662  were  done  following  15mg/m2  daily 
oral administration of sunitinib, however the proposed dosage to be included in the SmPC is 20mg/m2 
daily. Therefore the MAH is requested to perform the same simulation and the same comparison with 
the  observed  data  also  with  20mg/m2  daily  dosage  in  order  to  directly  compare  the  simulated 
exposure of the proposed dosage to be reported on the SmPC and the observed paediatric data. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Upon the request by the CHMP, the MAH conducted additional simulations with 20 mg/m2 daily dosage 
and compared to the observed pediatric data.  As the observed pediatric data were at 15 mg/m2 daily 
dosage, the observed exposure parameters were dose corrected to 20 mg/m2 for comparison purpose. 
Table 4,  Table 5,  and  Table 6  show  clinically  observed  dose-corrected  and  SimCYP-predicted  sunitinib 
and  SU012662  pharmacokinetic  parameter  estimates  in  pediatrics  in  Study  ADVL0612  (3-21  years 
old),  Study  ACNS1021  (3-19  years  old),  and  Study  A6181196  (13-16  years  old)  after  a  multiple  20-
mg/m2 daily oral dose of sunitinib, respectively.  Overall, the ratios of the predicted versus observed 
dose-corrected exposure values following trial simulations with the dose of 20 mg/m2 were essentially 
the  same  as  the  ones  obtained  with  the  dose  of  15  mg/m2  (SimCYP  Report  Section  4),  which  is  not 
unexpected considering the dose-linearity in the PK model.

Question 5  
SimCYP Simulation  
An in depth discussion on the proposed dose reported in the SmPC is needed: 
a)  Population  PK  and  PK-PD  analysis  (PMAR-EQDD-A618w-Other-366,  using  pooled  data  from 
paediatric  and  adult  patients)  conclusions:  Based  on  the  PK,  safety,  and  efficacy  trial 
simulation  results,  a  starting  dose  of  ~15  mg/m2/day  appears  to  be  inadequate;  however,  a 
starting dose of ~25 mg/m2/day is predicted to be more appropriate in pediatric patients with 
GIST and provides comparable plasma drug exposures, and subsequently safety, and efficacy 
to  those  in  adult  patients  with  GIST  treated  at  50  mg/day  on  Schedule  4/2.  Although  the 
starting  dose  of  15  mg/m2  was  selected  as  the  starting  dose  for  the  GIST  pediatric  study 
A6181196,  based  on  the  Phase  1  data  from  heavily  pre-treated  pediatric  patients  with  CNS 
tumours  (solid  tumours),  the  option  for  intra-patient  dose  escalation  to  22.5  mg/m2  and 
subsequently  to  30  mg/m2  was  allowed  to  ensure  maximum  plasma  drug  exposure  for  each 
individual patient; 
b)  Population  PK  analysis  (PMAR-EQDD-A618b-DP4-846,  using  data  from  paediatric  patients) 
conclusions:  Based  on  the  final  PK  model  predictions,  a  sunitinib  dose  of  approximately  20 
mg/m2/day  in  paediatric  patients  with  GIST  aged  6-17  years  would  be  expected  to  lead  to 
similar total plasma exposures for sunitinib and SU012662 as compared to adult patients with 
GIST on 50 mg/day, on Schedule 4/2; 
c)  PBPK  analysis  conclusions:  Based  on  the  simulated  exposures  in  different  ages  groups  of 
paediatrics  patients,  the  sunitinib  dose  that  will  lead  to  predicted  steady-state  total  plasma 
exposure over the dosing interval (i.e. steady-state AUC) similar to what has been observed in 
adults  with  GIST  (1233  ng•hr/mL  for  sunitinib,  551  ng•hr/mL  for  SU012662,  and  1822 
ng•hr/mL for the total active moieties) at 50 mg once daily (QD) is 17 mg/m2, 20 mg/m2, and 
24 mg/m2 for sunitinib; 28 mg/m2, 27 mg/m2, and 26 mg/m2 for SU012662; 20 mg/m2, 22 
mg/m2, and 25 mg/m2 for the total active moieties, respectively, for the age groups 2 to 5, 6 
to 11, and 12 to 17 years old. 
d)  In  the  Summary  of  Clinical  Pharmacology  Studies  25  mg/m2/day  and  20  mg/m2/day  are 
reported into two different sections as dose predicted to provide comparable sunitinib exposure 
to those in adult patients with GIST treated at 50 mg QD on schedule 4/2. 
e)  The MTD calculated in study ADVL0612 was lower compared to the doses reported above: MDT 
for  pediatric  patients  without  previous  exposure  to  anthracyclines  or  cardiac  irradiation  was 
indeed established to be 15 mg/m2 schedule 4/2. Although the MAH noted that in some cases 
patients  were  able  to  escalate  sunitinib  dose  (e.g.  in  study  A6181196),  there  is  a  concern  of 
safety  with  doses  higher  than  the  MTD.  The  MAH  should  take  this  data  into  account  in  its 
discussion.    
Given all the above considerations, the indication of the dose appears confounding, therefore, further 
discussion and analyses are requested. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The  determination  of  the  dose  in  pediatric  patients  with  GIST,  providing  comparable  exposures  to 
those in adult patients with GIST at 50 mg on Schedule 4/2, were made using 3 different analyses and 
approaches.

a. As part of the population PK and PK-PD analysis (PMAR-EQDD-A618w-Other-366, using pooled data 
from  paediatric  and  adult  patients),  only  data  from  one  pediatric  study  in  patients  with  solid  tumors 
were available to be included in the pooled dataset. The remaining data included adult data in patients 
with  GIST  and  solid  tumors.  As  part  of  the  final  population  PK  model  for  sunitinib  and  SU012662, 
Tumor Type (Solid Tumor vs GIST) was one of the variables identified as significant covariates on CL/F 
and  subsequently  was  used  in  extrapolation  of  PK parameters in  pediatric  patients  with  GIST  (PMAR-
EQDD-A618w-Other-366  PKPD  –  Published  Part  A  Sections  6.2.1  and  6.2.2).  Based  on  the  final  PK 
model, sunitinib (and SU012662) extrapolated CL/F in pediatric patients with GIST was predicted to be 
higher  than  that  in  pediatric  patients  with  solid  tumors.  Therefore,  in  the  absence  of  PK  data  in 
pediatric patients with GIST at the time of the analysis, it was assumed that the higher CL/F observed 
in  GIST  vs  Solid  Tumors  in  adults  was  also  applicable  to  that  in  pediatric  patients  [Note:  this 
assumption  was  not  later  confirmed  as  part  of  the  integrated  population  PK  analysis  (PMAR-EQDD-
A618b-DP4-846)]. 
b. In contrast to the initial population PK analysis (ie, PMAR-EQDD-A618w-Other-366), the integrated 
population  PK  analysis  (PMAR-EQDD-A618b-DP4-846,  using  data  from  only  pediatric  patients)  was 
based  on  only  pediatric  PK  data  and  included  PK  data  in  both  GIST  and  solid  tumor  patients  (2 
pediatric  solid  tumor  studies  and  1  pediatric  GIST  study).  Contrary  to  the  initial  analysis,  which  was 
mainly  based  on  adult  data,  this  analysis  did  not  identify  Tumor  Type  (GIST  vs.  Solid  Tumor)  as  a 
significant covariate on CL/F. Based on this analysis, due to the lack of Tumor Type effect on CL/F in 
pediatric  patients,  the  CL/F  values  estimated  for  pediatric  GIST  patients  were  comparable  to  that  in 
Solid Tumor patients and mainly driven by differences in body surface area (PMAR EQDD-A618b-DP4-
846 Section 6.2 and 6.3). Therefore, the difference in the dose projections based on the initial analysis 
and the integrated analysis (ie, 25 mg/m2 vs 20 mg/m2) could be in part due to the absence of Tumor 
Type effect (GIST vs Solid Tumor) on CL/F in pediatric patients.  
c. In the PBPK analysis (SimCYP Report, using physiochemical properties, preclinical, and clinical adult 
data),  the  PK  of  sunitinib  and  its  active  metabolite  was  predicted/simulated  based  on  a  hybrid 
approach (bottom up and top down approaches) using both physiochemical properties and pre-clinical 
data  (ie, bottom up) as well as adult clinical PK data (top down). Based on the SimCYP PBPK model, 
the PK predictions/simulations for pediatric patients appeared to be consistent with the observed data 
in both solid tumors and GIST patients with the geometric mean ratios of observed vs predicted for the 
majority of the PK parameters Cmax, AUC, and Ctrough falling within the 0.8 to 1.25 range. Similarly, 
the dose projections appeared to be within approximately 25% of the dose estimated by the integrated 
population  PK  analysis  (ie,  20  mg/m2).  Assuming  an  under-prediction  of  approximately  15% 
(Response to Question 3), the revised projected doses (ie, 19 mg/m2 for 6-11 years and 21 mg/m2 for 
12-17  years)  would  be  even  closer  (ie,  within  approximately  5%)  to  the  dose  estimated  by  the 
integrated  pop  PK  analysis  (ie,  20  mg/m2).  Therefore,  in  both  scenarios,  the  dose  projections  by 
SimCYP approach support the 20 mg/m2 dose determined by the integrated population PK analysis. 
d.  Considering  that  the  integrated  population  PK  analysis  included  data  from  3  pediatric  studies 
(instead  of  only  1)  in  both  GIST  and  solid  tumors  patients  (instead  of  only  solid  tumors),  the  dose 
projection  in  pediatric  patients  with  GIST  based  on  the  integrated  population  PK  analysis,  instead  of 
the initial analysis, was selected as the proposed dose in pediatric patients with GIST (please also refer 
to  Responses  to  Questions  5a  and  5b  for  further  details).  It  is  also  important  to  note  that  in  the 
absence of a Tumor Type effect on CL/F in pediatric patients (ie, CL/F in GIST being similar to CL/F in 
solid tumors), the approximated population CL/F value based on the initial analysis, for the integrated 
population  PK  analysis  Solid  Tumor/GIST  patient  population,  appears  to  be  comparable  to  the 
population CL/F value from the integrated population PK analysis (ie, 24.2 L/h vs 24.0 L/h for sunitinib 
and  10.9  L/h  vs  11.1  L/h  for  SU012662),  further  confirming  the  inherent  consistency  in  CL/F 
projections  and  consequently  dose  projections  in  pediatric  patients  with  GIST/solid  tumors  between 
Assessment report

both analyses. 
e. Based on the dose escalation study in pediatric patients with solid tumors, the maximum tolerated 
dose  was  determined  to  be  15  mg/m2.  The  MTD  projection  was  done  in  heavily  pretreated  pediatric 
patients  with  solid  tumors  and  the  majority  of  them  with  CNS  tumors.  In  Study  A6181196,  although 
the  starting  dose  was  15  mg/m2,  it  was  escalated  in  5/6  patients  to  22.5  mg/m2  and  in  2  out  of  5 
escalated further to 30 mg/m2. The average dose across the study was close to 20 mg/m2 (ie, 19.07 
mg/m2; Study A6181196 CSR Section 12.1.1). In addition, based on the published case studies from 
Janeway  et  al  and  Rutkowski  et  al  (Retrospective  Analysis  of  Medical  Records)  in  patients  where  the 
dose  per  body  surface  data  were  available,  the  median  (minimum-maximum)  dose  (ie,  starting  or 
average daily dose) per body surface area was 28 (17-36) mg/m2. In the majority of the patients (ie, 
12 out of 15 patients), the dose was higher than 20 mg/m2 and was tolerated well. Therefore, based 
on  available  safety  data  from  Study  A6181196  and  published  case  reports,  the  starting  or  average 
daily doses of 20 mg/m2 should be well tolerated in pediatric patients with GIST.   
Based  on  the  above,  the  MAH  would  like  to  confirm  that  there  are  no  confounding  factors  in 
determination of the projected dose in pediatric patients with GIST. The SmPC statement in regards to 
the  dose  of  approximately  20  mg/m2  is  in  reference  to  the  dose  in  pediatric  patients  expected  to 
provide  exposures  similar  to  that  obtained  in  adult  patients  with  GIST,  based  on  the  integrated 
population  PK  analysis.  In  addition,  based  on  available  safety  data  from  Study  A6181196  and 
published  case  reports,  the  safety  profile  of  the  starting  or  average  daily  doses  of  20  mg/m2  was 
manageable  in  pediatric  patients  with  GIST.  In  conclusion,  supportive  evidence  from  3  different 
analyses  and  from  the  available  pediatric  safety  data  in  patients  with  GIST  indicates  that  the  20 
mg/m2  dose  is  a  tolerable  dose  in  children  aging  6-17  years  and  provides  similar  drug  plasma 
exposures compared to those in adult patients with GIST at 50 mg on Schedule 4/2. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The  difference  between  the  initial  population  PK  analysis  (pooled  data  from  adult  and  paediatric 
patients)  and  the  integrated  population  PK  analysis  (only  paediatric  data)  is  the  inclusion  of  Tumor 
type as covariate on CL/F. In the first analysis it resulted to be significant, in the second one not.  The 
integrated  population  PK  analysis  was  selected  as  final  analysis  to  be  used  to  calculate  the  dose  in 
pediatric patients expected to provide exposures similar to that obtained in adult patients with GIST at 
50 mg on Schedule 4/2.  
Regarding the MTD, which is reported in SmPC, this was defined to be 15 mg/m2 on schedule 4/2 for 
the  paediatric  population  (without  risk  factors  for  cardiac  toxicity)  based  on  the  phase  I  dose-
escalation  study  ADVL0612.  As  stated  by  the  MAH  in  its  response,  the  MTD  projection  in  ADVL0612 
study  was  done  in  heavily  pretreated  pediatric  patients  mainly  with  CNS  tumors.  In  addition,  the 
starting  dose  in  both  clinical  trial  A6181196  and  ACNS1021  was  15  mg/m2  (based  on  the  MTD)  with 
the option to escalate the dose based on toxicity: in A6181196 some patients were able to receive up 
to 30 mg/m2 (data on how many patients escalated has not been found for ACNS1021 study). Further, 
the MAH noted that in the majority of the patients on the published case studies, the dose was higher 
than 20 mg/m2. The information that children received starting or average daily doses of 20 mg/m2 is 
not emerging from the SmPC, therefore it appears somewhat misleading to report that the MTD is 15 
mg/m2, and that 20 mg/m2 is the dose in pediatric patients expected to provide exposures similar to 
that obtained in adult patients with GIST.  
The MAH should propose wording in the appropriate sections of the SmPC to describe the dosages of

Sutent  received  by  paediatric  patients  in  the  clinical  setting  (e.g.  15  mg/m2  as  starting  dose,  use  of 
increased doses etc.) in order to explain the apparent contradiction between MTD and wording on 20 
mg/m2 . (OC)

Question 6  
Based  on  the  data  provided,  several  TEAEs  of  electrolyte  disturbances  (i.e.,  hypo/hypercalcemia, 
hypophosphatemia,  hypo/hyperkaliemia,  hyponatriemia,  hypermagnesemia),  also  with  high  severity 
grade,  have  been  reported  across  clinical  trials  with  sunitinib  in  children  (e.g.  in  Study  A6181196: 
hypophosphatemia  G3; 
in  Study  ADVL0612,  G3  hyponatriemia,  G3  hypophosphatemia,  G3 
hyperkaliemia; in study ACNS1021 hypocalcemia G4 and hyponatriemia G3). In various cases they are 
reported  as  related  to  sunitinib.  It  is  noted  that  no  electrolyte  imbalances  are  reported  as  ADR  of 
sunitinib in the SmPC section 4.8. The MAH should discuss this finding, and evaluate how to eventually 
reflect relevant information for paediatric patients in the SmPC. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Upon  review  of  the  TEAEs  of  electrolyte  disturbances  in  paediatric  studies,  9  out  of  the  70  patients 
reported  11  Grade  3  TEAEs  [hypophosphatemia  (4),  hyperkalaemia  (3),  hyponatraemia  (2), 
hypokalaemia (2)] with sunitinib in A6181196 and ADVL0612 studies. Most of these TEAEs were non-
serious and resolved at the time of latest reported outcome. Of these 11 TEAEs, 6 TEAEs of electrolyte 
disturbances [G3 hypophosphatemia (4), G3 hyponatraemia (1), G3 hypokalemia (1)] were considered 
either possibly or probably related to sunitinib by the investigator. In 3/6, the TEAEs were serious and 
reported  as  resolved.  On  review  of  the  case  of  serious  G3  hyponatraemia  (2007092810),  the  MAH 
considers  hyponatraemia  was  confounded  by  the  presence  of  a  paraneoplastic  syndrome  of 
inappropriate  antidiuretic hormone  secretion  (SIADH)  secondary  to  progressive  lung  disease  and  was 
likely related to metastatic disease under study. Of note, this patient developed G3 hyponatraemia 10 
days  post  sunitinib  discontinuation.  Upon  review  of  serious  TEAEs  of  G3  hypophosphatemia  and  G3 
hypokalemia  that  were  reported  in  a  patient  with  refractory/recurrent  neuroblastoma  in  the  case 
2007039720,  the  MAH  considers  that  the  patient’s  progressive  underlying  disease  Central  Nervous 
System (CNS) pathology may have contributed to the occurrence of these events. 
In  study  ACNS1021,  no  TEAEs  of  electrolyte  disturbances  were  reported.  Three  patients  reported 
laboratory  abnormalities  of  G4  hypocalcaemia  (2)  based  on  total  calcium  levels.  Ionized  calcium  was 
not  reported  and  these  were  not  reported  as  TEAEs.  One  patient  had  a  laboratory  abnormality  of  G3 
hypokalemia which was not reported as TEAE. Please note, there was no laboratory abnormality of G3 
hyponatraemia.  Overall,  since  most  of  the  patients  with  TEAEs  of  electrolyte  disturbances  had  highly 
progressive  CNS  tumors,  it  is  suggested  that  the  underlying  disease  may  have  contributed  to  the 
development of these laboratory abnormalities. The TEAEs of electrolyte disturbance reported in these 
studies  were  manageable  and  well-tolerated  in  this  patient  population.  Thus,  the  MAH  proposes  that 
the  currently  proposed  text  in  the  updated  SmPC  appropriately  represents  the  safety  information 
regarding TEAEs of electrolyte disturbances from these studies. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH reviewed the TEAEs of electrolyte disturbances occurred in paediatric studies, reporting that 
Assessment report

Page 103/109 
 
 
 
 
 
9/70  (13%)  patients  reported  11  Grade  3  TEAEs  [hypophosphatemia  (4),  hyperkalaemia  (3), 
hyponatraemia (2), hypokalaemia (2)]; 6/11 were considered probably or possibly related to sunitinib, 
and  3/6  of  them  were  serious  and  resolved.  The  three  SAEs  (hypophosphatemia,  hypokalaemia, 
hyponatraemia)  were  considered  confounded  by  advanced  primary  tumor  and  paraneoplastic 
syndrome  (SIADH).  In  study  ACNS1021,  the  3  episodes  of  electrolyte  disturbances  reported  (G4 
hypocalcemia (2 episodes) and G3 hypokaliemia (1 event)) were reported on laboratory values and not 
as  TEAE,  and  no  further  information  regarding  possible  relationship  with  study  drug  as  evaluated  by 
investigator are available.  
It is noted that SmPC 4.8 section includes the information that, for A6181196, Grade 3 adverse drug 
reactions  reported  were  hypophosphatemia,  (neutropenia  and  thrombocytopenia)  in  1  patient  each 
(16.7%).  Based  on  the  MAH’s  review  of  the  grade  ≥3  electrolyte  disturbances  described,  no  further 
information is considered needed in the SmPC.

12.  2nd Request for supplementary information  
12.1.  Other concerns 
Clinical aspects 
1.  The MAH should propose wording in the appropriate sections of the SmPC to describe the dosages 
of  Sutent  received  by  paediatric  patients  in  the  clinical  trials/case  series  (e.g.  15  mg/m2  as 
starting dose, use of increased doses etc.) in order to explain the apparent contradiction between 
MTD (15 mg/m2) and wording on 20 mg/m2.  
User testing 
2.  Q6  (Please  name  three  very  common  side  effects  that  may  occur  with  Sutent)  has  a  long  list  of 
answers  that  could  increase  the  possibility  of  a  positive  results.  Moreover,  it is  not  clear  how  the 
answer is scored in case the participant listed only one or two side effects. This aspect should be 
clarified. 
3.  Q9  (What  should  a  breast-feeding  woman  consider  before  she  starts  taking  Sutent?)  has  two 
possible  answers  (She  should  tell  her  doctor.  She  should  not  breast-feed  during  treatment  with 
Sutent.  Optional:  If  she  is  breast-feeding,  she  should  ask  her  doctor  or  pharmacist  for  advice 
before  taking  this  medicine).  The  first  answer  represents  the  focus  since  breast-feeding  woman 
should  clearly  understand  that  breast-feeding  must  be  stopped  before  she  starts  treatment  with 
Sutent.  Since  it  is  not  possible  to  check  the  answers  due  to  the  lack  of  a  detailed  summary  of 
individual  responses,  it  should  be  clarified  if  a  positive  outcome  was  registered  in  case  only  the 
optional answer was given.     
4.  Regarding questions for which a “difficulty” or “very difficulty” score in finding the information was 
reported, a clarification is needed, since there is a discrepancy between data reported in table 14 
and those reported in tables 8 and 9. 
5.  Q4 (Suppose you are treated for GIST (Gastrointestinal stromal tumour). What is the usual dose?) 
registered the “very difficult finding” score. The wording used in the PL section 3 is: ”Your doctor 
will prescribe a dose that is right for you, depending on the type of cancer to be treated. If you are 
being treated for GIST or MRCC, the usual dose is 50 mg once daily taken for 28 days (4 weeks), 
followed by 14 days (2 weeks) of rest (no medicine), in 6-week cycles. If you are being treated for 
pNET, the usual dose is 37.5 mg once daily without a rest period”. 
6.  In order to better identify the information regarding the dose indicated for each tumor type in the 
PL, a bulleted list could be used to distinguish the two possible dose regimens.

Question 1 
The MAH should propose wording in the appropriate sections of the SmPC to describe the dosages of 
Sutent received by paediatric patients in the clinical trials/case series (e.g. 15 mg/m2 as starting dose, 
use of increased doses etc.) in order to explain the apparent contradiction between MTD (15 mg/m2) 
and wording on 20 mg/m2.

Summary of the MAH’s response 
The  MAH  agrees  with  the  Rapporteur’s  recommendation  and  Section  5.2  of  the  SmPC  has  been 
updated to read as follows (text in “tracked changes” mode): 
Pharmacokinetic properties: 
Furthermore,  based  on  an  integrated  population  PK  analysis  of  pooled  data  from  the  3  paediatric 
studies (2 paediatric solid tumor studies and 1 paediatric GIST study; ages: 6 years to 11 years and 12 
years to 17 years), baseline body surface area (BSA) was a significant covariate on apparent clearance 
of sunitinib and its active metabolite. Based on this analysis, a dose of approximately 20 mg/m2 daily 
(BSA  range:  1.10-1.87  m2)  in  paediatric  patients,  with  BSA  values  between  1.10  and  1.87  m2,  is 
expected  to  provide  plasma  exposures to  sunitinib  and  its  active  metabolite  comparable  (between 75 
and 125% of the AUC) to those in adults with GIST administered sunitinib 50 mg daily on Schedule 4/2 
(AUC 1233 ng.hr/mL). 
In  paediatric  studies,  the  starting  dose  of  sunitinib  was  15  mg/m2,  which  in  paediatric  patients  with 
GIST  increased  to  22.5  mg/m2  and  subsequently  to  30  mg/m2  (not  to  exceed  the  total  dose  of  50 
mg/day)  based  on  individual  patient  safety/tolerability.  Furthermore,  according  to  the  published 
literatures in paediatric patients with GIST, the calculated starting dose ranged from 16.6 mg/m2 to 36 
mg/m2, increased to doses as high as 40.4 mg/m2 (not exceeding the total dose of 50 mg/day). 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The  MAH  modified  the  SmPC  as  per  CHMP  request.  The  wording  is  considered  overall  acceptable  for 
this section, although a minor rewording to specify that the starting dose of 15 mg/m2 was based on 
the identified MDT is suggested, as follow (additional words highlighted in yellow): 
Section 4.8 
In these paediatric patients without previous exposure to anthracyclines or cardiac irradiation, the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been identified (see section 5.1). 
Section 5.2 
In paediatric studies, the starting dose of sunitinib was 15 mg/m2 (based on the MTD identified in 
the  Phase  1  dose-escalation  study,  see  section  5.1), which  in  paediatric  patients  with  GIST 
increased  to  22.5  mg/m2 and  subsequently  to  30  mg/m2(not  to  exceed  the  total  dose  of  50  mg/day) 
based  on  individual  patient  safety/tolerability.  Furthermore,  according  to  the  published  literatures  in 
paediatric  patients  with  GIST,  the  calculated  starting  dose  ranged  from  16.6  mg/m2 to  36  mg/m2, 
increased to doses as high as 40.4 mg/m2 (not exceeding the total dose of 50 mg/day). 
Conclusion 
Issue solved, provided the rewording of sections 4.8 and 5.2 as suggested.

User testing Q6 (Please name three very common side effects that may occur with Sutent) has a long 
list of answers that could increase the possibility of a positive results. Moreover, it is not clear how the 
Assessment report

answer  is  scored  in  case  the  participant  listed  only  one  or  two  side  effects.  This  aspect  should  be 
clarified. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
In  the  case  only  1  or  2  side  effects  are  listed,  the  question  is  repeated  and  rated  “sufficiently 
understood” or “not understood” depending on the answer.  
Finding scores are not affected as the participant found the sought paragraph. Usually, if a participant 
found the information but gives an incomplete answer, he/she misunderstood the question. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The  MAH’s  response  can  be  considered  acceptable,  however,  as  a  general  rule,  in  order  to  better 
assess the results of UT, it is preferable that a detailed summary of individual responses is submitted.

Issue solved 
Question 3 
User testing Q9 (What should a breast-feeding woman consider before she starts taking Sutent?) has 
two  possible  answers  (She  should  tell  her  doctor.  She  should  not  breast-feed  during  treatment  with 
Sutent.  Optional:  If  she  is  breast-feeding,  she  should  ask  her  doctor  or  pharmacist  for  advice  before 
taking this medicine). The first answer represents the focus since breast feeding woman should clearly 
understand that breast feeding must be stopped before she starts treatment with Sutent.  
Since  it  is  not  possible  to  check  the  answers  due  to  the  lack  of  a  detailed  summary  of  individual 
responses, it should be clarified if a positive outcome was registered in case only the optional answer 
was given. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
If,  after  repetition  of  the  question,  only  the  optional  answer  is  given,  the  question  is  rated  “not 
found/not understood”.  
Optional  answer  is  an  information  for  the  interviewer,  so  that  the  interviewer  knows  that  if  a 
participant additionally gives the optional answer, the answer must not be rated as incorrect.

Question 4 
Regarding  questions  for  which  a  “difficulty”  or  “very  difficulty”  score  in  finding  the  information  was 
reported, a clarification is needed, since there is a discrepancy between data reported in table 14 and 
those reported in tables 8 and 9.

Table  14  of  the  user  testing  report  shows  the  detailed  ease  of  finding  results,  independent  of 
participants comments. In tables 8 and 9 individual questions are only listed if the participants provide 
a comment, independently of the finding or comprehension score.

Question 5 
Q4  (Suppose  you  are  treated  for  GIST  (Gastrointestinal  stromal  tumour).  What  is  the  usual  dose?) 
registered the “very difficult finding” score. The wording used in the PL section 3 is: ”Your doctor will 
prescribe a dose that is right for you, depending on the type of cancer to be treated. If you are being 
treated for GIST or MRCC, the usual dose is 50 mg once daily taken for 28 days (4 weeks), followed by 
14 days (2 weeks) of rest (no medicine), in 6-week cycles. If you are being treated for pNET, the usual 
dose is 37.5 mg once daily without a rest period”. 
In order to better identify the information regarding the dose indicated for each tumor type in the PL, a 
bulleted list could be used to distinguish the two possible dose regimens. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has updated the Package Leaflet accordingly.

Additional changes to the SmPC made by the MAH 
As per Rapporteur’s comment, Section 5.1 of the SmPC has been updated to include the efficacy data 
related to Study A6181196. In addition, the sentence related to the publications has been rephrased to 
avoid duplication of the text (changes highlighted in “track changes mode”): 
“Evidence from a Phase 1/2 study of oral sunitinib conducted in 6 paediatric patients with GIST aged 
13  years  to  16  years  who  received  sunitinib  on  Schedule  4/2,  at  doses  ranging  between  15  mg/m2 
daily  and  30  mg/m2  daily,  and  available  published  data  (20  paediatric  or  young  adult  patients  with 
GIST) indicated that sunitinib treatment resulted in disease stabilization in 18 of 26 (69.2%) patients, 
either after imatinib failure or intolerance (16 patients with stable disease out of 21), or de novo/after 
surgery  (2  patients  with  stable  disease  out  of  5).  In  this  the  Phase  1/2  study,  stable  disease  and 
disease  progression  was  observed  in  3  out  of  6  patients  each  (1  patient  received  new 
adjuvant and 1 patient received adjuvant imatinib, respectively).  In the same study, 4 out of 
6  patients  (66.7%)  experienced  grade  3-4  treatment-related  adverse  events  (Grade  3 
hypophosphatemia,  neutropenia,  and  thrombocytopenia  in  1  patient  each  and  a  Grade  4  neutropenia 
was reported in 1 patient).  
In  addition,  the  publications  reported  the  following  Grade  3  adverse  drug  reactions 
experienced  by  5  patients:  fatigue  (2),  gastrointestinal  adverse  drug  reactions  (including 
diarrhoea)  (2),  haematologic  adverse  drug  reactions  (including  anaemia)  (2),  cholecystitis 
(1), hyperthyroidism (1), and mucositis (1).”

The MAH would like also to inform that in Section 4.8 and Section 5.1 the text was corrected as some 
events are not adverse drug reactions but treatment related treatment emergent adverse events. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH’s proposal is accepted.  
 Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
 No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance

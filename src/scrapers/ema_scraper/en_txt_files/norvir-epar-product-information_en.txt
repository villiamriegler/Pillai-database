Children and adolescents
Ritonavir is recommended for children 2 years of age and older.  For further dosage recommendations, 
refer to the product information of other protease inhibitors approved for co-administration with
ritonavir.
Special populations
Renal impairment
As ritonavir is primarily metabolised by the liver, ritonavir may be appropriate for use with caution as 
a pharmacokinetic enhancer in patients with renal insufficiency depending on the specific protease 
inhibitor with which it is co-administered.  However, since the renal clearance of ritonavir is 
negligible, the decrease in the total body clearance is not expected in patients with renal impairment.  
For specific dosing information in patients with renal impairment, refer to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SPC) of the co-administered protease inhibitor.
Hepatic impairment
Ritonavir should not be given as a pharmacokinetic enhancer to patients with decompensated liver 
disease (see section 4.3).  In the absence of pharmacokinetic studies in patients with stable severe 
hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Grade C) without decompensation, caution should be exercised when 
ritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer as increased levels of the co-administered PI may 
occur.  Specific recommendations for use of ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer in patients with 
hepatic impairment are dependent on the protease inhibitor with which it is co-administered.  The SPC 
of the co-administered PI should be reviewed for specific dosing information in this patient 
population. 
Ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent
Adults
The recommended dose of Norvir powder for oral suspension is 600 mg (six sachets) twice daily by 
mouth and should be given with food. 
Gradually increasing the dose of ritonavir when initiating therapy may help to improve tolerance.  
Treatment should be initiated at 300 mg (three sachets) twice daily for a period of three days and 
increased by 100 mg (one sachet) twice daily increments up to 600 mg twice daily over a period of no 
longer than 14 days.  Patients should not remain on 300 mg twice daily for more than 3 days.
Refer to Method of Administration section below and section 6.6 for details on preparing doses.
Children and adolescents (2 years of age and above)
The recommended dosage of Norvir powder for suspension in children is 350 mg/m² by mouth twice 
daily and should not exceed 600 mg twice daily.  Norvir should be started at 250 mg/m² and increased 
at 2 to 3 day intervals by 50 mg/m² twice daily.

†In some instances, the volumes and/or doses have been adjusted to ensure the recommended final dose and 
dosing volume. 
Body surface area can be calculated with the following equation:  BSA (m2) = √(Height (cm) X Weight (kg) / 
3600)
To calculate the volume to be administered (in ml) for intermediate body surface areas not included in 
the above table, the body surface area should be multiplied by a factor of: 25 for a dose of 250 mg/m²; 
30 for 300 mg/m²; and 35 for 350 mg/m². 
Refer to Method of Administration section below and section 6.6 for details on preparing doses.
Special populations
Elderly
Pharmacokinetic data indicated that no dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (see section 
5.2).
Renal impairment
Currently, there are no data specific to this patient population and therefore specific dosage 
recommendations cannot be made.  The renal clearance of ritonavir is negligible; therefore, a decrease 
in the total body clearance is not expected in patients with renal impairment.  Because ritonavir is 
highly protein bound it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal 
dialysis.
Hepatic impairment
Ritonavir is principally metabolised and eliminated by the liver.  Pharmacokinetic data indicate that no 
dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).  
Ritonavir must not be given to patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3).  
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of Norvir in children aged below 2 years has not been established.  Currently 
available data are described in sections 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be 
made.
Method of administration
Norvir powder for oral suspension is administered orally, poured on soft food (apple sauce or vanilla 
pudding) or mixed with liquid (water, chocolate milk, or infant formula).  For details on preparation 
and administration of the Norvir powder for oral suspension, see section 6.6.  Any mixing outside the
recommendations is the responsibility of the health care professional or the user.
Norvir powder for oral suspension should be taken with food. The bitter aftertaste of Norvir powder 
for oral suspension may be lessened if peanut butter, hazelnut chocolate spread, or black currant syrup 
are taken immediately after dose administration.
The prescribed dose of Norvir powder for oral suspension can be administered via a feeding tube after 
being mixed with water as detailed in section 6.6.  Follow the instructions for the feeding tube to 
administer the medicine.

4.3  Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  
When ritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer of other PIs, consult the Summary of Product 
Characteristics of the co-administered protease inhibitor for contraindications.
Ritonavir should not be given as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent to patients 
with decompensated liver disease.
In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A- and 
CYP2D6- mediated biotransformations.  The following medicines are contraindicated when used with 
ritonavir and unless otherwise noted, the contraindication is based on the potential for ritonavir to 
inhibit metabolism of the co-administered medicinal product, resulting in increased exposure to the 
co-administered medicinal product and risk of clinically significant adverse effects.
The enzyme-modulating effect of ritonavir may be dose dependent.  For some products, 
contraindications may be more relevant when ritonavir is used as an antiretroviral agent than when 
ritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer (e.g. rifabutin and voriconazole):

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use
Ritonavir is not a cure for HIV-1 infection or AIDS.  Patients receiving ritonavir or any other 
antiretroviral therapy may continue to develop opportunistic infections and other complications of 
HIV-1 infection. 
When ritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer with other PIs, full details on the warnings and 
precautions relevant to that particular PI should be considered, therefore the Summary of Product 
Characteristics for the particular PI must be consulted.
Ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer  
Patients with chronic diarrhoea or malabsorption
Extra monitoring is recommended when diarrhoea occurs.  The relatively high frequency of diarrhoea 
during treatment with ritonavir may compromise the absorption and efficacy (due to decreased 
compliance) of ritonavir or other concurrent medicinal products.  Serious persistent vomiting and/or 
diarrhoea associated with ritonavir use might also compromise renal function.  It is advisable to 
monitor renal function in patients with renal function impairment.
Haemophilia
There have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin haematomas and 
haemarthroses, in haemophiliac patients type A and B treated with protease inhibitors.  In some 
patients additional factor VIII was given.  In more than a half of the reported cases, treatment with 
protease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued.  A causal 
relationship has been evoked, although the mechanism of action has not been elucidated.  
Haemophiliac patients should, therefore, be made aware of the possibility of increased bleeding.
Weight and metabolic parameters: 
An increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral 
therapy.  Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style.  For lipids, there is in 
7
some cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating 
this to any particular treatment.  For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose, reference is made to 
established HIV treatment guidelines.  Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate.
Pancreatitis
Pancreatitis should be considered if clinical symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain) or 
abnormalities in laboratory values (such as increased serum lipase or amylase values) suggestive of 
pancreatitis should occur.  Patients who exhibit these signs or symptoms should be evaluated and 
Norvir therapy should be discontinued if a diagnosis of pancreatitis is made (see section 4.8).
Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome
In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination 
antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymtomatic or residual opportunistic 
pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.  Typically, 
such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART.  
Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, 
and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia.  Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and 
treatment instituted when necessary.
Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to 
occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and 
can occur many months after initiation of treatment.
Liver disease
Ritonavir should not be given to patients with decompensated liver disease (see section 4.2).  Patients 
with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased 
risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions.  In case of concomitant antiviral therapy 
for hepatitis B or C, please refer to the relevant product information for these medicinal products.
Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased 
frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be 
monitored according to standard practice.  If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such 
patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered.
Renal disease
Since the renal clearance of ritonavir is negligible, the decrease in the total body clearance is not 
expected in patients with renal impairment (see also section 4.2).
Renal failure, renal impairment, elevated creatinine, hypophosphataemia and proximal tubulopathy 
(including Fanconi syndrome) have been reported with the use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF)
in clinical practice (see section 4.8).
Medication error
Special attention should be given to the accurate calculation of the dose of Norvir, transcription of the 
medication order, dispensing information and dosing instructions to minimise the risk for medication 
errors and underdose.  This is especially important for infants and young children.
Osteonecrosis
Although the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol 
consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been 
reported in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to combination 
antiretroviral therapy (CART).  Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience 
joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.
PR interval prolongation
8
Ritonavir has been shown to cause modest asymptomatic prolongation of the PR interval in some 
healthy adult subjects.  Rare reports of 2nd or 3rd degree atrioventricular block in patients with 
underlying structural heart disease and pre-existing conduction system abnormalities or in patients 
receiving medicinal products known to prolong the PR interval (such as verapamil or atazanavir) have 
been reported in patients receiving ritonavir.  Norvir should be used with caution in such patients (see 
section 5.1).
Interactions with other medicinal products
Ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent
The following warnings and precautions should be considered when ritonavir is used as an 
antiretroviral agent.  When ritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer at the 100 mg and 200 mg 
level it cannot be assumed that the following warnings and precautions will also apply.  When 
ritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer, full details on the warnings and precautions relevant 
to that particular PI must be considered, therefore the Summary of Product Characteristics, section 4.4, 
for the particular PI must be consulted to determine if the information below is applicable.
PDE5 inhibitors
Particular caution should be used when prescribing sildenafil or tadalafil for the treatment of erectile 
dysfunction in patients receiving ritonavir.  Co-administration of ritonavir with these medicinal 
products is expected to substantially increase their concentrations and may result in associated adverse 
reactions such as hypotension and prolonged erection (see section 4.5).  Concomitant use of avanafil 
or vardenafil with ritonavir is contraindicated (see section 4.3).  Concomitant use of sildenafil with 
ritonavir is contraindicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients (see section 4.3).
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors
The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors simvastatin and lovastatin are highly dependent on CYP3A for 
metabolism, thus concomitant use of ritonavir with simvastatin or lovastatin is not recommended due 
to an increased risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis.  Caution must also be exercised and 
reduced doses should be considered if ritonavir is used concurrently with atorvastatin, which is 
metabolised to a lesser extent by CYP3A.  While rosuvastatin elimination is not dependent on 
CYP3A, an elevation of rosuvastatin exposure has been reported with ritonavir co-administration.  The 
mechanism of this interaction is not clear, but may be the result of transporter inhibition.  When used 
with ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent, the lowest doses of 
atorvastatin or rosuvastatin should be administered.  The metabolism of pravastatin and fluvastatin is 
not dependent of CYP3A, and interactions are not expected with ritonavir.  If treatment with an HMG-
CoA reductase inhibitor is indicated, pravastatin or fluvastatin is recommended (see section 4.5).
Colchicine
Life-threatening and fatal drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with colchicine and 
strong inhibitors of CYP3A like ritonavir (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).
Digoxin
Particular caution should be used when prescribing ritonavir in patients taking digoxin since 
co-administration of ritonavir with digoxin is expected to increase digoxin levels.  The increased 
digoxin levels may lessen over time (see section 4.5).
In patients who are already taking digoxin when ritonavir is introduced, the digoxin dose should be 
reduced to one-half of the patients’ normal dose and patient need to be followed more closely than 
usual for several weeks after initiating co-administration of ritonavir and digoxin.
In patients who are already taking ritonavir when digoxin is introduced, digoxin should be introduced 
more gradually than usual.  Digoxin levels should be monitored more intensively than usual during 
9
this period, with dose adjustments made, as necessary, based on clinical, electrocardiographic and 
digoxin level findings.
Ethinyl estradiol
Barrier or other non-hormonal methods of contraception should be considered when administering 
ritonavir at therapeutic or low doses as ritonavir is likely to reduce the effect and change the uterine 
bleeding profile when co-administered with estradiol-containing contraceptives.
Glucocorticoids
Concomitant use of ritonavir and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised by CYP3A4 
is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic 
corticosteroid effects, including Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression (see section 4.5).
Trazodone
Particular caution should be used when prescribing ritonavir in patients using trazodone.  Trazodone is 
a CYP3A4 substrate and co-administration of ritonavir is expected to increase trazodone levels.  
Adverse reactions of nausea, dizziness, hypotension and syncope have been observed in single dose 
interaction studies in healthy volunteers (see section 4.5).
Rivaroxaban
It is not recommended to use ritonavir in patients receiving rivaroxaban, due to the risk of increased 
bleeding (see section 4.5).
Riociguat
The concomitant use of ritonavir is not recommended due to potential increase in riociguat exposure 
(see section 4.5).
Vorapaxar
The concomitant use of ritonavir is not recommended due to potential increase in vorapaxar exposure 
(see section 4.5).
Bedaquiline
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as protease inhibitors may increase bedaquiline exposure which could 
potentially increase the risk of bedaquiline-related adverse reactions.  Therefore, combination of 
bedaquiline with ritonavir should be avoided.  However, if the benefit outweighs the risk, co-
administration of bedaquiline with ritonavir must be done with caution.  More frequent 
electrocardiogram monitoring and monitoring of transaminases is recommended (see section 4.5 and 
refer to the bedaquiline Summary of Product Characteristics).
Delamanid
Co-administration of delamanid with a strong inhibitor of CYP3A (ritonavir) may increase exposure to 
delamanid metabolite, which has been associated with QTc prolongation.  Therefore, if 
co-administration of delamanid with ritonavir is considered necessary, very frequent ECG monitoring 
throughout the full delamanid treatment period is recommended (see section 4.5 and refer to the 
delamanid Summary of Product Characteristics). 
Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer
The interaction profiles of HIV-protease inhibitors, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, are 
dependent on the specific co-administered protease inhibitor. 
For a description of the mechanisms and potential mechanisms contributing to the interaction profile 
of the PIs, see section 4.5.  Please also review the Summary of Product Characteristics for the 
particular boosted PI.
10
Saquinavir
Doses of ritonavir higher than 100 mg twice daily should not be used.  Higher doses of ritonavir have 
been shown to be associated with an increased incidence of adverse reactions.  Co-administration of 
saquinavir and ritonavir has led to severe adverse reactions, mainly diabetic ketoacidosis and liver 
disorders, especially in patients with pre-existing liver disease.  
Saquinavir/ritonavir should not be given together with rifampicin, due to the risk of severe 
hepatotoxicity (presenting as increased hepatic transaminases) if the three medicines are given 
together (see section 4.5).
Tipranavir
Co-administration of tipranavir with 200 mg of ritonavir has been associated with reports of clinical 
hepatitis and hepatic decompensation including some fatalities.  Extra vigilance is warranted in 
patients with chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C co-infection, as these patients have an increased risk of 
hepatotoxicity. 
Doses of ritonavir lower than 200 mg twice daily should not be used as they might alter the efficacy 
profile of the combination.
Fosamprenavir
Co-administration of fosamprenavir with ritonavir in doses greater than 100 mg twice daily has not 
been clinically evaluated.  The use of higher ritonavir doses might alter the safety profile of the 
combination and therefore is not recommended.
Atazanavir
Co-administration of atazanavir with ritonavir at doses greater than 100 mg once daily has not been 
clinically evaluated.  The use of higher ritonavir doses may alter the safety profile of atazanavir 
(cardiac effects, hyperbilirubinemia) and therefore is not recommended.  Only when atazanavir with 
ritonavir is co-administered with efavirenz, a dose increase of ritonavir to 200mg once daily could be 
considered.  In this instance, close clinical monitoring is warranted.  Refer to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics for atazanavir for further details.
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent
Ritonavir has a high affinity for several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms and may inhibit oxidation 
with the following ranked order: CYP3A4 > CYP2D6.  Co-administration of ritonavir and medicinal 
products primarily metabolised by CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentrations of the other 
medicinal product, which could increase or prolong its therapeutic and adverse effects.  For selected
medicinal products (e.g. alprazolam) the inhibitory effects of ritonavir on CYP3A4 may decrease over 
time.  Ritonavir also has a high affinity for P-glycoprotein and may inhibit this transporter.  The 
inhibitory effect of ritonavir (with or without other protease inhibitors) on P-gp activity may decrease 
over time (e.g. digoxin and fexofenadine-see table “Ritonavir effects on non-antiretroviral medicinal 
products” below).  Ritonavir may induce glucuronidation and oxidation by CYP1A2, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 thereby increasing the biotransformation of some medicinal products 
metabolised by these pathways, and may result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal 
products, which could decease or shorten their therapeutic effect.  
Important information regarding medicinal product interactions when ritonavir is used as a 
pharmacokinetic enhancer is also contained in the Summary of Product Characteristics of the 
co-administered protease inhibitor.
11
Medicinal products that affect ritonavir levels
Serum levels of ritonavir can be reduced by concomitant use of herbal preparations containing 
St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum).  This is due to the induction of medicinal product 
metabolising enzymes by St John’s wort.  Herbal preparations containing St John’s wort must not be 
used in combination with ritonavir.  If a patient is already taking St John’s wort, St John’s wort should 
be stopped and if possible check viral levels.  Ritonavir levels may increase on stopping St John’s 
wort.  The dose of ritonavir may need adjusting.  The inducing effect may persist for at least 2 weeks 
after cessation of treatment with St John’s wort (see section 4.3).  
Serum levels of ritonavir may be affected by select co-administered medicinal products (e.g.
delavirdine, efavirenz, phenytoin and rifampicin).  These interactions are noted in the medicinal 
product interaction tables below.
Medicinal product that are affected by the use of ritonavir
Interactions between ritonavir and protease inhibitors, antiretroviral agents other than protease 
inhibitors and other non-antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in the tables below.  This list is not 
intended to be inclusive or comprehensive.  Individual SmPCs should be consulted.

avoided.  If the benefit is considered to outweigh the risk and ritonavir must be used, 
patients should be carefully monitored for safety.
Co-administration of fostamatinib with ritonavir may increase fostamatinib
metabolite R406 exposure resulting in dose-related adverse events such as 
hepatotoxicity, neutropenia, hypertension, or diarrhoea.  Refer to the fostamatinib 
SmPC for dose reduction recommendations if such events occur.
Serum concentrations of ibrutinib may be increased due to CYP3A inhibition by 
ritonavir, resulting in increased risk for toxicity including risk of tumor lysis

Although rifampicin may induce metabolism of ritonavir, limited data indicate that 
when high doses of ritonavir (600 mg twice daily) is co-administered with 
rifampicin, the additional inducing effect of rifampicin (next to that of ritonavir 
itself) is small and may have no clinical relevant effect on ritonavir levels in high-

No interaction study is available with ritonavir only.  In an interaction study of 
single-dose bedaquiline and multiple dose lopinavir/ritonavir, the AUC of 
bedaquiline was increased by 22%.  This increase is likely due to ritonavir and a 
more pronounced effect may be observed during prolonged co-administration.  Due 
to the risk of bedaquiline related adverse events, co-administration should be 
avoided.  If the benefit outweighs the risk, co-administration of bedaquiline with 
ritonavir must be done with caution.  More frequent electrocardiogram monitoring

Due to the large therapeutic window of clarithromycin no dose reduction should be

agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer.  For patients with renal impairment, a 
clarithromycin dose reduction should be considered: for patients with creatinine 
clearance of 30 to 60 ml/min the dose should be reduced by 50%, for patients with 
creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min the dose should be reduced by 75%.
No interaction study is available with ritonavir only.  In a healthy volunteer drug 
interaction study of delamanid 100 mg twice daily and lopinavir/ritonavir 
400/100 mg twice daily for 14 days, the exposure of the delamanid metabolite DM-
6705 was 30% increased.  Due to the risk of QTc prolongation associated with 
DM-6705, if co-administration of delamanid with ritonavir is considered necessary, 
very frequent ECG monitoring throughout the full delamanid treatment period is 
recommended (see section 4.4 and refer to the delamanid Summary of Product
Characteristics).
Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent inhibits

it may increase quetiapine-related toxicity (see section 4.3).
β2-agonist (long acting)
Salmeterol
Calcium channel antagonists
Amlodipine, diltiazem, nifedipine
Endothelin antagonists
Bosentan
Riociguat
Ergot Derivatives
Ritonavir inhibits CYP3A4 and as a result a pronounced increase in the plasma 
concentrations of salmeterol is expected.  Therefore concomitant use is not 
recommended.
Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent inhibits 
CYP3A4 and as a result is expected to increase the plasma concentrations of 
calcium channel antagonists.  Careful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects 
is recommended when these medicines are concomitantly administered with 
ritonavir.
Co-administration of bosentan and ritonavir may increase steady state
bosentan maximum concentrations (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC)
Serum concentrations may be increased due to CYP3A and P-gp inhibition by 
ritonavir.  The co-administration of riociguat with Norvir is not recommended (see 
section 4.4 and refer to riociguat SmPC).
Dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, 
ergotamine, methylergonovine
Ritonavir co-administration is likely to result in increased plasma concentrations of 
ergot derivatives and is therefore contraindicated (see section 4.3).
GI motility agent
Cisapride
HCV Direct Acting Antiviral
Ritonavir co-administration is likely to result in increased plasma concentrations of 
cisapride and is therefore contraindicated (see section 4.3).

↑ 4.7-fold
Ritonavir increases plasma concentrations of simeprevir as a result of CYP3A4 
inhibition.  It is not recommended to co-administer ritonavir with simeprevir.
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors which are highly dependent on CYP3A metabolism, 
such as lovastatin and simvastatin, are expected to have markedly increased plasma 
concentrations when co-administered with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent 
or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer.  Since increased concentrations of lovastatin and 
simvastatin may predispose patients to myopathies, including rhabdomyolysis, the 
combination of these medicinal products with ritonavir is contraindicated (see 
section 4.3).  Atorvastatin is less dependent on CYP3A for metabolism.  While 
rosuvastatin elimination is not dependent on CYP3A, an elevation of rosuvastatin 
exposure has been reported with ritonavir co-administration.  The mechanism of this 
interaction is not clear, but may be the result of transporter inhibition.  When used 
with ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent, the 
lowest possible doses of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin should be administered.  The 
metabolism of pravastatin and fluvastatin is not dependent on CYP3A, and 
interactions are not expected with ritonavir.  If treatment with an HMG-CoA 
reductase inhibitor is indicated, pravastatin or fluvastatin is recommended.

Due to reductions in ethinyl estradiol concentrations, barrier or other non-hormonal

dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer.  Ritonavir is 
likely to change the uterine bleeding profile and reduce the effectiveness of 
estradiol-containing contraceptives (see section 4.4).

Ritonavir co-administration is likely to result in increased plasma concentrations of 
clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam and flurazepam and is therefore contraindicated 
(see section 4.3). 
Midazolam is extensively metabolised by CYP3A4.  Co-administration with Norvir 
may cause a large increase in the concentration of this benzodiazepine.  No 
medicinal product interaction study has been performed for the co-administration of 
Norvir with benzodiazepines.  Based on data for other CYP3A4 inhibitors, plasma 
concentrations of midazolam are expected to be significantly higher when 
midazolam is given orally.  Therefore, Norvir should not be co-administered with 
orally administered midazolam (see section 4.3), whereas caution should be used 
with co-administration of Norvir and parenteral midazolam.  Data from concomitant 
use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors suggest a possible 3 – 4 
fold increase in midazolam plasma levels.  If Norvir is co-administered with 
parenteral midazolam, it should be done in an intensive care unit (ICU) or similar 
setting which ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical 
management in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation.  Dosage 
adjustment for midazolam should be considered, especially if more than a single

warranted during the first several days when alprazolam is co-administered with 
ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer, before 
induction of alprazolam metabolism develops.
Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent inhibits 
CYP3A and as a result is expected to increase the plasma concentrations of 
buspirone.  Careful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is recommended 
when buspirone concomitantly administered with ritonavir.

Bupropion is primarily metabolised by CYP2B6.  Concurrent administration of 
bupropion with repeated doses of ritonavir is expected to decrease bupropion levels.  
These effects are thought to represent induction of bupropion metabolism.  
However, because ritonavir has also been shown to inhibit CYP2B6 in vitro, the 
recommended dose of bupropion should not be exceeded.  In contrast to long-term 
administration of ritonavir, there was no significant interaction with bupropion after 
short-term administration of low doses of ritonavir (200 mg twice daily for 2 days), 
suggesting reductions in bupropion concentrations may have onset several days after 
initiation of ritonavir co-administration.
Systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal 
suppression (plasma cortisol levels were noted to be decreased 86% in the above 
study) have been reported in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasal 
fluticasone propionate; similar effects could also occur with other corticosteroids 
metabolised by CYP3A e.g., budesonide and triamcinolone.  Consequently, 
concomitant administration of ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a 
pharmacokinetic enhancer and these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the 
potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects 
(see section 4.4).  A dose reduction of the glucocorticoid should be considered with 
close monitoring of local and systemic effects or a switch to a glucocorticoid, which 
is not a substrate for CYP3A4 (e.g., beclomethasone).  Moreover, in case of 
withdrawal of glucocorticoids progressive dose reduction may be required over a 
longer period.   
Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent inhibits 
CYP3A and as a result is expected to increase the plasma concentrations of 
dexamethasone.  Careful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is 
recommended when dexamethasone is concomitantly administered with ritonavir.

month after starting and/or ending ritonavir treatment.
ND: Not determined

2. Sulfamethoxazole was co-administered with trimethoprim. 
Cardiac and neurologic events have been reported when ritonavir has been co-administered with 
disopyramide, mexiletine or nefazodone.  The possibility of medicinal product interaction cannot be 
excluded.
In addition to the interactions listed above, as ritonavir is highly protein bound, the possibility of 
increased therapeutic and toxic effects due to protein binding displacement of concomitant medicinal 
products should be considered.
Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer
Important information regarding medicinal product interactions when ritonavir is used a 
pharmacokinetic enhancer is also contained in the Summary of Product Characteristics of the co-
administered protease inhibitor. 
Proton pump inhibitors and H2-receptor antagonists
Proton pump inhibitors and H2-receptor antagonists (e.g. omeprazole or ranitidine) may reduce 
concentrations for co-administered protease inhibitors.  For specific information regarding the impact 
of co-administration of acid reducing agents, refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of the 
co-administered protease inhibitor.  Based on interaction studies with the ritonavir boosted protease 
inhibitors (lopinavir/ritonavir, atazanavir), concurrent administration of omeprazole or ranitidine does 
not significantly modify ritonavir efficacy as a pharmacokinetic enhancer despite a slight change of 
exposure (about 6 - 18%).
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
A large amount (6100 live births) of pregnant women were exposed to ritonavir during pregnancy; of 
these, 2800 live births were exposed during the first trimester.  These data largely refer to exposures 
where ritonavir was used in combination therapy and not at therapeutic ritonavir doses but at lower 
doses as a pharmacokinetic enhancer for other PIs.  These data indicate no increase in the rate of birth 
defects compared to rates observed in population-based birth defect surveillance systems.  Animal data 
have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  Norvir can be used during pregnancy if clinically 
needed.
Ritonavir adversely interacts with oral contraceptives (OCs).  Therefore, an alternative, effective and 
safe method of contraception should be used during treatment.
27
Breast-feeding
Limited published data reports that ritonavir is present in human milk.
There is no information on the effects of ritonavir on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on 
milk production.  Because of the potential for (1) HIV transmission (in HIV-negative infants), (2) 
developing viral resistance (in HIV-positive infants) and (3) serious adverse reactions in a breastfed 
infant, women living with HIV should not breast-feed their infants if they are receiving Norvir.
Fertility 
No human data on the effect of ritonavir on fertility are available.  Animal studies do not indicate 
harmful effects of ritonavir on fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Dizziness is a 
known undesirable effect that should be taken into account when driving or using machinery.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer
Adverse reactions associated with the use of ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer are dependent on 
the specific co-administered PI.  For information on adverse reactions refer to the SPC of the specific 
co-administered PI.
Ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent
Adverse reactions from clinical trials and post-marketing experience in adult patients
The most frequently reported adverse drug reactions among patients receiving ritonavir alone or in 
combination with other antiretroviral drugs were gastrointestinal (including diarrhoea, nausea, 
vomiting, abdominal pain (upper and lower)), neurological disturbances (including paraesthesia and 
oral paraesthesia) and fatigue/asthenia.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Description of selected adverse reactions
Hepatic transaminase elevations exceeding five times the upper limit or normal, clinical hepatitis, and 
jaundice have occurred in patients receiving ritonavir alone or in combination with other 
antiretrovirals.
Metabolic parameters
Weight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section 
4.4).
In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination 
antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic 
infections may arise.  Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have 
also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and can occur many months 
after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).
Pancreatitis has been observed in patients receiving ritonavir therapy, including those who developed 
hypertriglyceridaemia.  In some cases fatalities have been observed.  Patients with advanced HIV 
disease may be at risk of elevated triglycerides and pancreatitis (see section 4.4).
30
Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk 
factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).  
The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).
Paediatric populations
The safety profile of Norvir in children 2 years of age and older is similar to that seen in adults.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Symptoms
Human experience of acute overdose with ritonavir is limited.  One patient in clinical trials took 
ritonavir 1500 mg/day for two days and reported paraesthesia, which resolved after the dose was 
decreased.  A case of renal failure with eosinophilia has been reported.
The signs of toxicity observed in animals (mice and rats) included decreased activity, ataxia, dyspnoea 
and tremors.
Management
There is no specific antidote for overdose with ritonavir.  Treatment of overdose with ritonavir should 
consist of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the 
clinical status of the patient.  Due to the solubility characteristics and possibility of transintestinal 
elimination, it is proposed that management of overdose could entail gastric lavage and administration 
of activated charcoal.  Since ritonavir is extensively metabolised by the liver and is highly protein
bound, dialysis is unlikely to be beneficial in significant removal of the medicine.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmaco-therapeutic group: antiviral for systemic use, protease inhibitors ATC code: J05AE03
Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer
Pharmacokinetic enhancement by ritonavir is based on ritonavir’s activity as a potent inhibitor of 
CYP3A- mediated metabolism.  The degree of enhancement is related to the metabolic pathway of the 
co-administered protease inhibitor and the impact of the co-administered protease inhibitor on the 
metabolism of ritonavir.  Maximal inhibition of metabolism of the co-administered protease inhibitor 
is generally achieved with ritonavir doses of 100 mg daily to 200 mg twice daily, and is dependent on 
the co-administered protease inhibitor.  For additional information on the effect of ritonavir on 
co-administered protease inhibitor metabolism, see section 4.5 and refer to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics of the particular co-administered PIs.
Ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent
Ritonavir is an orally active peptidomimetic inhibitor of the HIV-1 and HIV-2 aspartyl proteases.  
Inhibition of HIV protease renders the enzyme incapable of processing the gag-pol polyprotein 
precursor which leads to the production of HIV particles with immature morphology that are unable to 
31
initiate new rounds of infection.  Ritonavir has selective affinity for the HIV protease and has little 
inhibitory activity against human aspartyl proteases.
Ritonavir was the first protease inhibitor (approved in 1996) for which efficacy was proven in a study 
with clinical endpoints.  However, due to ritonavir’s metabolic inhibitory properties its use as a 
pharmacokinetic enhancer of other protease inhibitors is the prevalent use of ritonavir in clinical 
practice (see section 4.2). 
Effects on the Electrocardiogram  
QTcF interval was evaluated in a randomised, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily) 
controlled crossover study in 45 healthy adults, with 10 measurements over 12 hours on Day 3.  The 
maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) difference in QTcF from placebo was 5.5 (7.6) for 
400 mg twice daily ritonavir.  The Day 3 ritonavir exposure was approximately 1.5 fold higher than 
that observed with the 600 mg twice daily dose at steady state.  No subject experienced an increase in 
QTcF of  60 msec from baseline or a QTcF interval exceeding the potentially clinically relevant 
threshold of 500 msec.
Modest prolongation of the PR interval was also noted in subjects receiving ritonavir in the same study 
on Day 3.  The mean changes from baseline in PR interval ranged from 11.0 to 24.0 msec in the 12 
hour interval post dose.  Maximum PR interval was 252 msec and no second or third degree heart 
block was observed (see section 4.4).
Resistance
Ritonavir-resistant isolates of HIV-1 have been selected in vitro and isolated from patients treated with 
therapeutic doses of ritonavir. 
Reduction in the antiretroviral activity of ritonavir is primarily associated with the protease mutations 
V82A/F/T/S and I84V.  Accumulation of other mutations in the protease gene (including at positions 
20, 33, 36, 46, 54, 71, and 90) can also contribute to ritonavir resistance.  In general, as mutations 
associated with ritonavir resistance accumulate, susceptibility to select other PIs may decrease due to 
cross-resistance.  The Summary of Product Characteristics of other protease inhibitors or official 
continuous updates should be consulted for specific information regarding protease mutations 
associated with reduced response to these agents.
Clinical pharmacodynamic data
The effects of ritonavir (alone or combined with other antiretroviral agents) on biological markers of 
disease activity such as CD4 cell count and viral RNA were evaluated in several studies involving 
HIV-1 infected patients.  The following studies are the most important.
Adult Use
A controlled study completed in 1996 with ritonavir as add-on therapy in HIV-1 infected patients 
extensively pre-treated with nucleoside analogues and baseline CD4 cell counts  100 cells/l showed 
a reduction in mortality and AIDS defining events.  The mean average change from baseline over 16 
weeks for HIV RNA levels was -0.79 log10 (maximum mean decrease: 1.29 log10) in the ritonavir 
group versus-0.01 log10 in the control group.  The most frequently used nucleosides in this study were 
zidovudine, stavudine, didanosine and zalcitabine. 
In a study completed in 1996 recruiting less advanced HIV-1 infected patients (CD4 200-500 cells/l) 
without previous antiretroviral therapy, ritonavir in combination with zidovudine or alone reduced 
viral load in plasma and increased CD4 count.  The mean average change from baseline over 48 weeks 
32
  
for HIV RNA levels was -0.88 log10 in the ritonavir group versus -0.66 log10 in the ritonavir + 
zidovudine group versus -0.42 log10 in the zidovudine group.
The continuation of ritonavir therapy should be evaluated by viral load because of the possibility of 
the emergence of resistance as described under section 4.1.
Paediatric Use
In an open label trial completed in 1998 in HIV infected, clinically stable children there was a 
significant difference (p = 0.03) in the detectable RNA levels in favour of a triple regimen (ritonavir, 
zidovudine and lamivudine) following 48 weeks treatment.
In a study completed in 2003, 50 HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitor and lamivudine naïve children age 
4 weeks to 2 years received ritonavir 350 or 450 mg/m2 every 12 hours co-administered with 
zidovudine 160 mg/m2 every 8 hours and lamivudine 4 mg/kg every 12 hours.  In intent to treat 
analyses, 72% and 36% of patients achieved reduction in plasma HIV-1 RNA of  400 copies/ml at 
Week 16 and 104, respectively.  Response was similar in both dosing regimens and across patient age.  
In a study completed in 2000, 76 HIV-1 infected children aged 6 months to 12 years who were 
protease inhibitor naive and naive to lamivudine and/or stavudine received ritonavir 350 or 450 mg/m2
every 12 hours co-administered with lamivudine and stavudine.  In intent to treat analyses, 50% and 
57% of patients in the 350 and 450 mg/m2 dose groups, respectively, achieved reduction in plasma 
HIV-1 RNA to ≤ 400 copies/ml at Week 48.
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
There is no parenteral formulation of ritonavir, therefore the extent of absorption and absolute 
bioavailability has not been determined.  The pharmacokinetics of ritonavir during multiple dose 
regimens were studied in non-fasting HIV-infected adult volunteers.  Upon multiple dosing, ritonavir 
accumulation is slightly less than predicted from a single dose due to a time and dose-related increase 
in apparent clearance (Cl/F).  Trough concentrations of ritonavir decrease over time, possibly due to 
enzyme induction, but appeared to stabilise by the end of 2 weeks.  The time to maximum 
concentration (Tmax) remained constant at approximately 4 hours with increasing dose.  Renal 
clearance averaged less than 0.1 l/h and was relatively constant throughout the dosage range.
The pharmacokinetic parameters observed with various dosing schemes of ritonavir alone are shown 
in the table below.

Effects of food on oral absorption
Administration of a single 100 mg dose of ritonavir powder for oral suspension with a moderate fat 
meal (617 kcal, 29% calories from fat) was associated with a mean decrease of 23 and 39% in 
ritonavir AUCinf and Cmax respectively, relative to fasting conditions.  Administration with a high fat 
meal (917 kcal, 60% calories from fat) was associated with a mean decrease of 32 and 49% in 
ritonavir AUCinf and Cmax respectively, relative to fasting conditions.
Distribution
The apparent volume of distribution (VB/F) of ritonavir is approximately 20 - 40 l after a single 
600 mg dose.  The protein binding of ritonavir in human plasma is approximately 98 - 99% and is 
constant over the concentration range of 1.0 – 100 g/ml.  Ritonavir binds to both human alpha 1-acid 
glycoprotein (AAG) and human serum albumin (HSA) with comparable affinities.
Tissue distribution studies with 14C-labelled ritonavir in rats showed the liver, adrenals, pancreas, 
kidneys and thyroid to have the highest concentrations of ritonavir.  Tissue to plasma ratios of 
approximately 1 measured in rat lymph nodes suggests that ritonavir distributes into lymphatic tissues.  
Ritonavir penetrates minimally into the brain.
Biotransformation
Ritonavir was noted to be extensively metabolised by the hepatic cytochrome P450 system, primarily 
by the CYP3A isozyme family and to a lesser extent by the CYP2D6 isoform.  Animal studies as well 
as in vitro experiments with human hepatic microsomes indicated that ritonavir primarily underwent 
oxidative metabolism.  Four ritonavir metabolites have been identified in man.  The isopropylthiazole 
oxidation metabolite (M-2) is the major metabolite and has antiviral activity similar to that of parent 
compound.  However, the AUC of the M-2 metabolite was approximately 3% of the AUC of parent 
compound.  
Low doses of ritonavir have shown profound effects on the pharmacokinetics of other protease 
inhibitors (and other products metabolised by CYP3A4) and other protease inhibitors may influence 
the pharmacokinetics of ritonavir (see section 4.5).  
Elimination
Human studies with radiolabelled ritonavir demonstrated that the elimination of ritonavir was 
primarily via the hepatobiliary system; approximately 86% of radiolabel was recovered from stool, 
part of which is expected to be unabsorbed ritonavir.  In these studies renal elimination was not found 
to be a major route of elimination of ritonavir.  This was consistent with the observations in animal 
studies.
Special populations
No clinically significant differences in AUC or Cmax were noted between males and females.  
Ritonavir pharmacokinetic parameters were not statistically significantly associated with body weight 
or lean body mass.  Ritonavir plasma exposures in patients 50 – 70 years of age when dosed 100 mg in 
combination with lopinavir or at higher doses in the absence of other protease inhibitors is similar to 
that observed in younger adults.
Patients with impaired liver function
After multiple dosing of ritonavir to healthy volunteers (500 mg twice daily) and subjects with mild to 
moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class A and B, 400 mg twice daily) exposure to ritonavir 
after dose normalisation was not significantly different between the two groups.  
Patients with impaired renal function
34
Ritonavir pharmacokinetic parameters have not been studied in patients with renal impairment.  
However, since the renal clearance of ritonavir is negligible, no changes in the total body clearance are 
expected in patients with renal impairment.  
Paediatric patients
Ritonavir steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in HIV infected children above 2 
years of age receiving doses ranging from 250 mg/m² twice daily to 400 mg/m² twice daily.  Ritonavir 
concentrations obtained after 350 to 400 mg/m² twice daily in paediatric patients were comparable to 
those obtained in adults receiving 600 mg (approximately 330 mg/m²) twice daily.  Across dose 
groups, ritonavir oral clearance (CL/F/m2) was approximately 1.5 to 1.7 times faster in paediatric 
patients above 2 years of age than in adult subjects.
Ritonavir steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in HIV infected children less than 
2 years of age receiving doses ranging from 350 to 450 mg/m² twice daily.  Ritonavir concentrations in 
this study were highly variable and somewhat lower than those obtained in adults receiving 600 mg 
(approximately 330 mg/m²) twice daily.  Across dose groups, ritonavir oral clearance (CL/F/m2) 
declined with age with median values of 9.0 L/h/m2 in children less than 3 months of age, 7.8 L/h/m2
in children between 3 and 6 months of age and 4.4 L/h/m2 in children between 6 and 24 months of age.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Repeated dose toxicity studies in animals identified major target organs as the liver, retina, thyroid 
gland and kidney.  Hepatic changes involved hepatocellular, biliary and phagocytic elements and were 
accompanied by increases in hepatic enzymes.  Hyperplasia of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) 
and retinal degeneration have been seen in all of the rodent studies conducted with ritonavir, but have 
not been seen in dogs.  Ultrastructural evidence suggests that these retinal changes may be secondary 
to phospholipidosis.  However, clinical trials revealed no evidence of medicinal product-induced 
ocular changes in humans.  All thyroid changes were reversible upon discontinuation of ritonavir.  
Clinical investigation in humans has revealed no clinically significant alteration in thyroid function 
tests.  Renal changes including tubular degeneration, chronic inflammation and proteinurea were noted 
in rats and are felt to be attributable to species-specific spontaneous disease.  Furthermore, no 
clinically significant renal abnormalities were noted in clinical trials.
Developmental toxicity observed in rats (embryolethality, decreased foetal body weight and 
ossification delays and visceral changes, including delayed testicular descent) occurred mainly at a 
maternally toxic dosage.  Developmental toxicity in rabbits (embryolethality, decreased litter size and 
decreased foetal weights) occurred at a maternally toxic dosage.
Ritonavir was not found to be mutagenic or clastogenic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays 
including the Ames bacterial reverse mutation assay using S. typhimurium and E. coli, the mouse 
lymphoma assay, the mouse micronucleus test and chromosomal aberration assays in human 
lymphocytes.
Long term carcinogenicity studies of ritonavir in mice and rats revealed tumourigenic potential 
specific for these species, but are regarded as of no relevance for humans.

Children and adolescents
Ritonavir is recommended for children 2 years of age and older.  For further dosage recommendations, 
refer to the product information of other Protease Inhibitors approved for co-administration with 
ritonavir.  
Special populations
Renal impairment
As ritonavir is primarily metabolised by the liver, ritonavir may be appropriate for use with caution as 
a pharmacokinetic enhancer in patients with renal insufficiency depending on the specific protease 
inhibitor with which it is co-administered.  However, since the renal clearance of ritonavir is 
negligible, the decrease in the total body clearance is not expected in patients with renal impairment.  
For specific dosing information in patients with renal impairment, refer to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SPC) of the co-administered protease inhibitor.
Hepatic impairment
Ritonavir should not be given as a pharmacokinetic enhancer to patients with decompensated liver 
disease, (see section 4.3).  In the absence of pharmacokinetic studies in patients with stable severe 
hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Grade C) without decompensation, caution should be exercised when 
ritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer as increased levels of the co-administered PI may 
occur.  Specific recommendations for use of ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer in patients with 
hepatic impairment are dependent on the protease inhibitor with which it is co-administered.  The SPC 
of the co-administered PI should be reviewed for specific dosing information in this patient 
population. 
Ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent
Adults
The recommended dose of Norvir film-coated tablets is 600 mg (6 tablets) twice daily (total of 
1200 mg per day) by mouth.
Gradually increasing the dose of ritonavir when initiating therapy may help to improve tolerance.  
Treatment should be initiated at 300 mg (3 tablets) twice daily for a period of three days and increased 
by 100 mg (1 tablet) twice daily increments up to 600 mg twice daily over a period of no longer than 
14 days.  Patients should not remain on 300 mg twice daily for more than 3 days.
Children and adolescents (2 years of age and above)
The recommended dosage of Norvir in children is 350 mg/m² by mouth twice daily and should not 
exceed 600 mg twice daily.  Norvir should be started at 250 mg/m² and increased at 2 to 3 day 
intervals by 50 mg/m² twice daily (please refer to the Norvir 100 mg powder for oral suspension
Summary of Product Characteristics).
For older children it may be feasible to substitute tablets for the maintenance dose of the powder for 
oral suspension.

Norvir is not recommended in children below 2 years of age due to lack of data on safety and efficacy.
Special populations
Elderly
Pharmacokinetic data indicated that no dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (see section 
5.2).
Renal impairment
Currently, there are no data specific to this patient population and therefore specific dosage 
recommendations cannot be made.  The renal clearance of ritonavir is negligible therefore; a decrease 
in the total body clearance is not expected in patients with renal impairment.  Because ritonavir is 
highly protein bound it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal 
dialysis.
Hepatic impairment
Ritonavir is principally metabolised and eliminated by the liver.  Pharmacokinetic data indicate that no 
dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).  
Ritonavir must not be given to patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3).  
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of Norvir in childred aged below 2 years has not been established. Currently 
available data are described in sections 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be 
made.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  
When ritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer of other PIs, consult the Summary of Product 
Characteristics of the co-administered protease inhibitor for contraindications.
Ritonavir should not be given as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent to patients 
with decompensated liver disease. 
In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A- and 
CYP2D6- mediated biotransformations.  The following medicines are contraindicated when used with 
ritonavir and unless otherwise noted, the contraindication is based on the potential for ritonavir to 
inhibit metabolism of the co-administered medicinal product, resulting in increased exposure to the 
co-administered medicinal product and risk of clinically significant adverse effects.
40
The enzyme-modulating effect of ritonavir may be dose dependent.  For some products, 
contraindications may be more relevant when ritonavir is used as an antiretroviral agent than when 
ritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer (e.g. rifabutin and voriconazole):

Special warnings and precautions for use
Ritonavir is not a cure for HIV-1 infection or AIDS.  Patients receiving Ritonavir or any other 
antiretroviral therapy may continue to develop opportunistic infections and other complications of 
HIV-1 infection. 
When ritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer with other PIs, full details on the warnings and 
precautions relevant to that particular PI should be considered, therefore the Summary of Product 
Characteristics for the particular PI must be consulted.
Ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer  
Patients with chronic diarrhoea or malabsorption
Extra monitoring is recommended when diarrhoea occurs.  The relatively high frequency of diarrhoea 
during treatment with ritonavir may compromise the absorption and efficacy (due to decreased 
compliance) of ritonavir or other concurrent medicinal products.  Serious persistent vomiting and/or 
diarrhoea associated with ritonavir use might also compromise renal function.  It is advisable to 
monitor renal function in patients with renal function impairment.
Haemophilia
There have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin haematomas and 
haemarthroses, in haemophiliac patients type A and B treated with protease inhibitors.  In some 
patients additional factor VIII was given.  In more than a half of the reported cases, treatment with 
protease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued.  A causal 
relationship has been evoked, although the mechanism of action has not been elucidated.  
Haemophiliac patients should therefore be made aware of the possibility of increased bleeding.
Weight and metabolic parameters: 
An increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral 
therapy.  Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style.  For lipids, there is in 
some cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating 
this to any particular treatment.  For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose, reference is made to 
established HIV treatment guidelines.  Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate.
Pancreatitis
Pancreatitis should be considered if clinical symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain) or 
abnormalities in laboratory values (such as increased serum lipase or amylase values) suggestive of 
pancreatitis should occur.  Patients who exhibit these signs or symptoms should be evaluated and 
Norvir therapy should be discontinued if a diagnosis of pancreatitis is made (see section 4.8).
Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome
In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination 
antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymtomatic or residual opportunistic 
pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.  Typically, 
such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART.  
Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, 
and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia.  Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and 
treatment instituted when necessary.
Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to 
occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and 
can occur many months after initiation of treatment.
43
Liver disease
Ritonavir should not be given to patients with decompensated liver disease (see section 4.2).  Patients 
with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased 
risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions.  In case of concomitant antiviral therapy 
for hepatitis B or C, please refer to the relevant product information for these medicinal products.
Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased
frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be 
monitored according to standard practice.  If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such 
patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered.
Renal disease
Since the renal clearance of ritonavir is negligible, the decrease in the total body clearance is not 
expected in patients with renal impairment (see also section 4.2).
Renal failure, renal impairment, elevated creatinine, hypophosphataemia and proximal tubulopathy 
(including Fanconi syndrome) have been reported with the use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF)
in clinical practice (see section 4.8).
Osteonecrosis
Although the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol 
consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been 
reported in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to combination 
antiretroviral therapy (CART).  Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience 
joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.
PR interval prolongation
Ritonavir has been shown to cause modest asymptomatic prolongation of the PR interval in some 
healthy adult subjects.  Rare reports of 2nd or 3rd degree atrioventricular block in patients with 
underlying structural heart disease and pre-existing conduction system abnormalities or in patients 
receiving medicinal products known to prolong the PR interval (such as verapamil or atazanavir) have 
been reported in patients receiving ritonavir.  Norvir should be used with caution in such patients (see 
section 5.1).
Interactions with other medicinal products
Ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent
The following warnings and precautions should be considered when ritonavir is used as an
antiretroviral agent.  When ritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer at the 100 mg and 200 mg 
level it cannot be assumed that the following warnings and precautions will also apply.  When 
ritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer, full details on the warnings and precautions relevant 
to that particular PI must be considered, therefore the Summary of Product Characteristics, section 4.4, 
for the particular PI must be consulted to determine if the information below is applicable.
PDE5 inhibitors
Particular caution should be used when prescribing sildenafil or tadalafil for the treatment of erectile 
dysfunction in patients receiving ritonavir.  Co-administration of ritonavir with these medicinal 
products is expected to substantially increase their concentrations and may result in associated adverse 
reactions such as hypotension and prolonged erection (see section 4.5).  Concomitant use of avanafil 
or vardenafil with ritonavir is contraindicated (see section 4.3).  Concomitant use of sildenafil with 
ritonavir is contraindicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients (see section 4.3).
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors
The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors simvastatin and lovastatin are highly dependent on CYP3A for 
metabolism, thus concomitant use of ritonavir with simvastatin or lovastatin is not recommended due 
44
to an increased risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis.  Caution must also be exercised and 
reduced doses should be considered if ritonavir is used concurrently with atorvastatin, which is 
metabolised to a lesser extent by CYP3A.  While rosuvastatin elimination is not dependent on 
CYP3A, an elevation of rosuvastatin exposure has been reported with ritonavir co-administration.  The 
mechanism of this interaction is not clear, but may be the result of transporter inhibition.  When used 
with ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent, the lowest doses of 
atorvastatin or rosuvastatin should be administered.  The metabolism of pravastatin and fluvastatin is 
not dependent of CYP3A, and interactions are not expected with ritonavir.  If treatment with an HMG-
CoA reductase inhibitor is indicated, pravastatin or fluvastatin is recommended (see section 4.5).
Colchicine
Life-threatening and fatal drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with colchicine and 
strong inhibitors of CYP3A like ritonavir (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).
Digoxin
Particular caution should be used when prescribing ritonavir in patients taking digoxin since 
co-administration of ritonavir with digoxin is expected to increase digoxin levels.  The increased 
digoxin levels may lessen over time (see section 4.5).
In patients who are already taking digoxin when ritonavir is introduced, the digoxin dose should be 
reduced to one-half of the patients’ normal dose and patients need to be followed more closely than 
usual for several weeks after initiating co-administration of ritonavir and digoxin.
In patients who are already taking ritonavir when digoxin is introduced, digoxin should be introduced 
more gradually than usual.  Digoxin levels should be monitored more intensively than usual during 
this period, with dose adjustments made, as necessary, based on clinical, electrocardiographic and 
digoxin level findings.
Ethinyl estradiol
Barrier or other non-hormonal methods of contraception should be considered when administering 
ritonavir at therapeutic or low doses as ritonavir is likely to reduce the effect and change the uterine 
bleeding profile when co-administered with estradiol-containing contraceptives.
Glucocorticoids
Concomitant use of ritonavir and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised by CYP3A4 
is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic 
corticosteroid effects, including Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression (see section 4.5).
Trazodone
Particular caution should be used when prescribing ritonavir in patients using trazodone.  Trazodone is 
a CYP3A4 substrate and co-administration of ritonavir is expected to increase trazodone levels.  
Adverse reactions of nausea, dizziness, hypotension and syncope have been observed in single dose 
interaction studies in healthy volunteers (see section 4.5).
Rivaroxaban
It is not recommended to use ritonavir in patients receiving rivaroxaban, due to the risk of increased 
bleeding (see section 4.5).
Riociguat
The concomitant use of ritonavir is not recommended due to potential increase in riociguat exposure 
(see section 4.5).
Vorapaxar
The concomitant use of ritonavir is not recommended due to potential increase in vorapaxar exposure 
(see section 4.5).
45
Bedaquiline
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as protease inhibitors may increase bedaquiline exposure which could 
potentially increase the risk of bedaquiline-related adverse reactions. Therefore, combination of 
bedaquiline with ritonavir should be avoided.  However, if the benefit outweighs the risk, co-
administration of bedaquiline with ritonavir must be done with caution. More frequent 
electrocardiogram monitoring and monitoring of transaminases is recommended (see section 4.5 and 
refer to the bedaquiline Summary of Product Characteristics).
Delamanid
Co-administration of delamanid with a strong inhibitor of CYP3A (ritonavir) may increase exposure to 
delamanid metabolite, which has been associated with QTc prolongation.  Therefore, if 
co-administration of delamanid with ritonavir is considered necessary, very frequent ECG monitoring 
throughout the full delamanid treatment period is recommended (see section 4.5 and refer to the 
delamanid Summary of Product Characteristics). 
Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer
The interaction profiles of HIV-protease inhibitors, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, are
dependant on the specific co-administered protease inhibitor. 
For a description of the mechanisms and potential mechanisms contributing to the interaction profile 
of the PIs, see section 4.5.  Please also review the Summary of Product Characteristics for the 
particular boosted PI.
Saquinavir
Doses of ritonavir higher than 100 mg twice daily should not be used.  Higher doses of ritonavir have 
been shown to be associated with an increased incidence of adverse reactions.  Co-administration of 
saquinavir and ritonavir has led to severe adverse reactions, mainly diabetic ketoacidosis and liver 
disorders, especially in patients with pre-existing liver disease.  
Saquinavir/ritonavir should not be given together with rifampicin, due to the risk of severe 
hepatotoxicity (presenting as increased hepatic transaminases) if the three medicines are given 
together (see section 4.5).
Tipranavir
Co-administration of tipranavir with 200 mg of ritonavir has been associated with reports of clinical 
hepatitis and hepatic decompensation including some fatalities.  Extra vigilance is warranted in 
patients with chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C co-infection, as these patients have an increased risk of 
hepatotoxicity. 
Doses of ritonavir lower than 200 mg twice daily should not be used as they might alter the efficacy 
profile of the combination.  
Fosamprenavir
Co-administration of fosamprenavir with ritonavir in doses greater than 100 mg twice daily has not 
been clinically evaluated.  The use of higher ritonavir doses might alter the safety profile of the 
combination and therefore is not recommended.
Atazanavir
Co-administration of atazanavir with ritonavir at doses greater than 100 mg once daily has not been 
clinically evaluated.  The use of higher ritonavir doses may alter the safety profile of atazanavir 
(cardiac effects, hyperbilirubinemia) and therefore is not recommended.  Only when atazanavir with 
ritonavir is co-administered with efavirenz, a dose increase of ritonavir to 200mg once daily could be 
considered. In this instance, close clinical monitoring is warranted.  Refer to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics for atazanavir for further details.

4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent
Ritonavir has a high affinity for several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms and may inhibit oxidation 
with the following ranked order: CYP3A4 > CYP2D6.  Co-administration of ritonavir and medicinal 
products primarily metabolised by CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentrations of the other 
medicinal product, which could increase or prolong its therapeutic and adverse effects. For selected
medicinal products (e.g. alprazolam) the inhibitory effects of ritonavir on CYP3A4 may decrease over 
time.  Ritonavir also has a high affinity for P-glycoprotein and may inhibit this transporter.  The 
inhibitory effect of ritonavir (with or without other protease inhibitors) on P-gp activity may decrease 
over time (e.g. digoxin and fexofenadine-see table “Ritonavir effects on non-antiretroviral medicinal 
products” below).  Ritonavir may induce glucuronidation and oxidation by CYP1A2, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 thereby increasing the biotransformation of some medicinal products 
metabolised by these pathways, and may result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal 
products, which could decease or shorten their therapeutic effect.  
Important information regarding medicinal product interactions when ritonavir is used as a 
pharmacokinetic enhancer is also contained in the Summary of Product Characteristics of the 
co-administered protease inhibitor.
Medicinal products that affect ritonavir levels
Serum levels of ritonavir can be reduced by concomitant use of herbal preparations containing 
St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum).  This is due to the induction of medicinal product 
metabolising enzymes by St John’s wort.  Herbal preparations containing St John’s wort must not be 
used in combination with ritonavir.  If a patient is already taking St John’s wort, St John’s wort should 
be stopped and if possible check viral levels.  Ritonavir levels may increase on stopping St John’s 
wort.  The dose of ritonavir may need adjusting.  The inducing effect may persist for at least 2 weeks 
after cessation of treatment with St John’s wort (see section 4.3).  
Serum levels of ritonavir may be affected by select co-administered medicinal products (e.g.
delavirdine, efavirenz, phenytoin and rifampicin).  These interactions are noted in the medicinal 
product interaction tables below.
Medicinal products that are affected by the use of ritonavir
Interactions between ritonavir and protease inhibitors, antiretroviral agents other than protease 
inhibitors and other non-antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in the tables below.  This list is not 
intended to be inclusive or comprehensive.  Individual SmPCs should be consulted.

recommendations.  Monitor for ADRs related to abemaciclib.
Apalutamide is a moderate to strong CYP3A4 inducer and this may lead to a decreased 
exposure of ritonavir and potential loss of virologic response.  In addition, serum 
concentrations may be increased when co-administered with ritonavir resulting in the 
potential for serious adverse events including seizure.  
Concomitant use of ritonavir with apalutamide is not recommended.
Serum concentrations may be increased due to CYP3A and P-gp inhibition by ritonavir.  
Caution should be exercised in administering ceritinib with Norvir.  Refer to the ceritinib

If the benefit is considered to outweigh the risk and ritonavir must be used, patients 
should be carefully monitored for safety.
Co-administration of fostamatinib with ritonavir may increase fostamatinib metabolite 
R406 exposure resulting in dose-related adverse events such as hepatotoxicity, 
neutropenia, hypertension, or diarrhoea.  Refer to the fostamatinib SmPC for dose

with caution, initiating trazodone at the lowest dosage and monitoring for clinical 
response and tolerability.
Anti-gout treatments
Colchicine
Antihistamines
Astemizole, terfenadine
Concentrations of colchicine are expected to increase when coadministered with ritonavir.
Life-threatening and fatal drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with 
colchicine and ritonavir (CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibition) in patients with renal and/or 
hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).  Refer to the colchicine prescribing 
information.
Ritonavir co-administration is likely to result in increased plasma concentrations of 
astemizole and terfenadine and is therefore contraindicated (see section 4.3).

Due to the large increase in rifabutin AUC, the concomitant use of rifabutin with ritonavir 
dosed as an antiretroviral agent is contraindicated (see section 4.3).  The reduction of the 
rifabutin dose to 150 mg 3 times per week may be indicated for select PIs when 
co-administered with ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer.  The Summary of Product 
Characteristics of the co-administered protease inhibitor should be consulted for specific 
recommendations.  Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate 
treatment of tuberculosis in HIV-infected patients. 
Although rifampicin may induce metabolism of ritonavir, limited data indicate that when 
high doses of ritonavir (600 mg twice daily) is co-administered with rifampicin, the 
additional inducing effect of rifampicin (next to that of ritonavir itself) is small and may 
have no clinical relevant effect on ritonavir levels in high-dose ritonavir therapy.  The 
effect of ritonavir on rifampicin is not known.

voriconazole.
Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent induces 
glucuronidation and as a result is expected to decrease the plasma concentrations of 
atovaquone. Careful monitoring of serum levels or therapeutic effects is recommended

observed during prolonged co-administration.  Due to the risk of bedaquiline related 
adverse events, co-administration should be avoided.  If the benefit outweighs the risk, 
co-administration of bedaquiline with ritonavir must be done with caution.  More frequent

a pharmacokinetic enhancer.  For patients with renal impairment, a clarithromycin dose 
reduction should be considered: for patients with creatinine clearance of 30 to 60 ml/min 
the dose should be reduced by 50%, for patients with creatinine clearance less than 
30 ml/min the dose should be reduced by 75%.
No interaction study is available with ritonavir only.  In a healthy volunteer drug 
interaction study of delamanid 100 mg twice daily and lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg 
twice daily for 14 days, the exposure of the delamanid metabolite DM-6705 was 30% 
increased.  Due to the risk of QTc prolongation associated with DM-6705, if 
co-administration of delamanid with ritonavir is considered necessary, very frequent ECG 
monitoring throughout the full delamanid treatment period is recommended (see section 
4.4 and refer to the delamanid Summary of Product Characteristics).
Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent inhibits 
CYP3A4 and as a result is expected to increase the plasma concentrations of 
erythromycin and itraconazole.  Careful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is

Ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent is likely to inhibit CYP2D6 and as a result is 
expected to increase concentrations of haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine.  Careful 
monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when these medicines are 
concomitantly administered with antiretroviral doses of ritonavir.
Due to CYP3A inhibition by ritonavir, concentrations of lurasidone are expected to 
increase.  The concomitant administration with lurasidone is contraindicated (see section 
4.3).
Due to CYP3A inhibition by ritonavir, concentrations of quetiapine are expected to 
increase.  Concomitant administration of Norvir and quetiapine is contraindicated as it 
may increase quetiapine-related toxicity (see section 4.3).
Ritonavir inhibits CYP3A4 and as a result a pronounced increase in the plasma 
concentrations of salmeterol is expected.  Therefore concomitant use is not recommended.
Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent inhibits 
CYP3A4 and as a result is expected to increase the plasma concentrations of calcium 
channel antagonists.  Careful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is 
recommended when these medicines are concomitantly administered with ritonavir.
Co-administration of bosentan and ritonavir may increase steady state
bosentan maximum concentr ations (Cmax) and area under the curve

Serum concentrations may be increased due to CYP3A and P-gp inhibition by ritonavir.  
The co-administration of riociguat with Norvir is not recommended (see section 4.4 and 
refer to riociguat SmPC).

HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors which are highly dependent on CYP3A metabolism, such 
as lovastatin and simvastatin, are expected to have markedly increased plasma 
concentrations when co-administered with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as 
a pharmacokinetic enhancer.  Since increased concentrations of lovastatin and simvastatin 
may predispose patients to myopathies, including rhabdomyolysis, the combination of 
these medicinal products with ritonavir is contraindicated (see section 4.3).  Atorvastatin 
is less dependent on CYP3A for metabolism.  While rosuvastatin elimination is not 
dependent on CYP3A, an elevation of rosuvastatin exposure has been reported with 
ritonavir co-administration.  The mechanism of this interaction is not clear, but may be 
the result of transporter inhibition.  When used with ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic 
enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent, the lowest possible doses of atorvastatin or 
rosuvastatin should be administered.  The metabolism of pravastatin and fluvastatin is not 
dependent on CYP3A, and interactions are not expected with ritonavir.  If treatment with 
an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor is indicated, pravastatin or fluvastatin is recommended.

Ritonavir co-administration is likely to result in increased plasma concentrations of 
clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam and flurazepam and is therefore contraindicated (see 
section 4.3). 
Midazolam is extensively metabolised by CYP3A4.  Co-administration with Norvir may 
cause a large increase in the concentration of this benzodiazepine.  No medicinal product 
interaction study has been performed for the co-administration of Norvir with 
benzodiazepines.  Based on data for other CYP3A4 inhibitors, plasma concentrations of 
midazolam are expected to be significantly higher when midazolam is given orally.  
Therefore, Norvir should not be co-administered with orally administered midazolam (see 
section 4.3), whereas caution should be used with co-administration of Norvir and 
parenteral midazolam.  Data from concomitant use of parenteral midazolam with other 
protease inhibitors suggest a possible 3 – 4 fold increase in midazolam plasma levels.  If 
Norvir is co-administered with parenteral midazolam, it should be done in an intensive 
care unit (ICU) or similar setting which ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate 
medical management in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation.  Dosage 
adjustment for midazolam should be considered, especially if more than a single dose of 
midazolam is administered.

alprazolam metabolism develops.
Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent inhibits

Bupropion is primarily metabolised by CYP2B6.  Concurrent administration of bupropion 
with repeated doses of ritonavir is expected to decrease bupropion levels.  These effects 
are thought to represent induction of bupropion metabolism.  However, because ritonavir 
has also been shown to inhibit CYP2B6 in vitro, the recommended dose of bupropion 
should not be exceeded.  In contrast to long-term administration of ritonavir, there was no 
significant interaction with bupropion after short-term administration of low doses of 
ritonavir (200 mg twice daily for 2 days), suggesting reductions in bupropion 
concentrations may have onset several days after initiation of ritonavir co-administration.
Systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression 
(plasma cortisol levels were noted to be decreased 86% in the above study) have been 
reported in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasal fluticasone propionate; 
similar effects could also occur with other corticosteroids metabolised by CYP3A e.g., 
budesonide and triamcinolone.  Consequently, concomitant administration of ritonavir 
dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer and these 
glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs 
the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4).  A dose reduction of the 
glucocorticoid should be considered with close monitoring of local and systemic effects 
or a switch to a glucocorticoid, which is not a substrate for CYP3A4 (e.g.,

Post-marketing cases have been reported indicating a potential interaction between

should be monitored in patients treated with levothyroxine at least the first month after 
starting and/or ending ritonavir treatment.
ND: Not determined

2. Sulfamethoxazole was co-administered with trimethoprim. 
Cardiac and neurologic events have been reported when ritonavir has been co-administered with disopyramide, 
mexiletine or nefazodone.  The possibility of medicinal product interaction cannot be excluded.
In addition to the interactions listed above, as ritonavir is highly protein bound, the possibility of increased 
therapeutic and toxic effects due to protein binding displacement of concomitant medicinal products should be 
considered.
Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer
Important information regarding medicinal product interactions when ritonavir is used a 
pharmacokinetic enhancer is also contained in the Summary of Product Characteristics of the co-
administered protease inhibitor.
Proton pump inhibitors and H2-receptor antagonists
Proton pump inhibitors and H2-receptor antagonists (e.g. omeprazole or ranitidine) may reduce 
concentrations for co-administered protease inhibitors.  For specific information regarding the impact 
of co-administration of acid reducing agents, refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of the 
co-administered protease inhibitor.  Based on interaction studies with the ritonavir boosted protease 
inhibitors (lopinavir/ritonavir, atazanavir), concurrent administration of omeprazole or ranitidine does 
not significantly modify ritonavir efficacy as a pharmacokinetic enhancer despite a slight change of 
exposure (about 6 - 18%).

Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
A large amount (6100 live births) of pregnant women were exposed to ritonavir during pregnancy; of 
these, 2800 live births were exposed during the first trimester.  These data largely refer to exposures 
where ritonavir was used in combination therapy and not at therapeutic ritonavir doses but at lower 
doses as a pharmacokinetic enhancer for other PIs.  These data indicate no increase in the rate of birth 
defects compared to rates observed in population-based birth defect surveillance systems.  Animal data 
have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  Norvir can be used during pregnancy if clinically 
needed.
Ritonavir adversely interacts with oral contraceptives (OCs).  Therefore, an alternative, effective and 
safe method of contraception should be used during treatment.
Breast-feeding
Limited published data reports that ritonavir is present in human milk.
There is no information on the effects of ritonavir on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on 
milk production.  Because of the potential for (1) HIV transmission (in HIV-negative infants), (2) 
developing viral resistance (in HIV-positive infants) and (3) serious adverse reactions in a breastfed 
infant, women living with HIV should not breast-feed their infants if they are receiving Norvir.  
Fertility
No human data on the effect of ritonavir on fertility are available.  Animal studies do not indicate 
harmful effects of ritonavir on fertility (see section 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.  Dizziness is a 
known undesirable effect that should be taken into account when driving or using machinery.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer
Adverse reactions associated with the use of ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer are dependent on 
the specific co-administered PI.  For information on adverse reactions refer to the SPC of the specific 
co-administered PI.
Ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent
Adverse reactions from clinical trials and post-marketing experience in adult patients
The most frequently reported adverse drug reactions among patients receiving ritonavir alone or in 
combination with other antiretroviral drugs were gastrointestinal (including diarrhea, nausea, 
vomiting, abdominal pain (upper and lower)), neurological disturbances (including paresthesia and 
oral paresthesia) and fatigue/asthenia.

Hepatic transaminase elevations exceeding five times the upper limit or normal, clinical hepatitis, and 
jaundice have occurred in patients receiving ritonavir alone or in combination with other 
antiretrovirals.
Metabolic parameters
Weight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section 
4.4).
In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination 
antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic 
infections may arise.  Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have 
also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and can occur many months 
after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).
Pancreatitis has been observed in patients receiving ritonavir therapy, including those who developed 
hypertriglyceridemia.  In some cases fatalities have been observed.  Patients with advanced HIV 
disease may be at risk of elevated triglycerides and pancreatitis (see section 4.4).
65
Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk 
factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).  
The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).
Paediatric populations
The safety profile of Norvir in children 2 years of age and older is similar to that seen in adults.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Symptoms
Human experience of acute overdose with ritonavir is limited.  One patient in clinical trials took 
ritonavir 1500 mg/day for two days and reported paraesthesia, which resolved after the dose was 
decreased.  A case of renal failure with eosinophilia has been reported.
The signs of toxicity observed in animals (mice and rats) included decreased activity, ataxia, dyspnoea 
and tremors.
Management
There is no specific antidote for overdose with ritonavir.  Treatment of overdose with ritonavir should 
consist of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the 
clinical status of the patient.  Due to the solubility characteristics and possibility of transintestinal 
elimination, it is proposed that management of overdose could entail gastric lavage and administration 
of activated charcoal.  Since ritonavir is extensively metabolised by the liver and is highly protein 
bound, dialysis is unlikely to be beneficial in significant removal of the medicine.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, protease inhibitors ATC code: J05AE03
Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer
Pharmacokinetic enhancement by ritonavir is based on ritonavir’s activity as a potent inhibitor of 
CYP3A- mediated metabolism.  The degree of enhancement is related to the metabolic pathway of the 
co-administered protease inhibitor and the impact of the co-administered protease inhibitor on the 
metabolism of ritonavir.  Maximal inhibition of metabolism of the co-administered protease inhibitor 
is generally achieved with ritonavir doses of 100 mg daily to 200 mg twice daily, and is dependent on 
the co-administered protease inhibitor.  For additional information on the effect of ritonavir on 
co-administered protease inhibitor metabolism, see section 4.5 and refer to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics of the particular co-administered PIs.
Ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent 
Ritonavir is an orally active peptidomimetic inhibitor of the HIV-1 and HIV-2 aspartyl proteases.  
Inhibition of HIV protease renders the enzyme incapable of processing the gag-pol polyprotein 
precursor which leads to the production of HIV particles with immature morphology that are unable to 
66
initiate new rounds of infection.  Ritonavir has selective affinity for the HIV protease and has little 
inhibitory activity against human aspartyl proteases.
Ritonavir was the first protease inhibitor (approved in 1996) for which efficacy was proven in a study 
with clinical endpoints.  However, due to ritonavir’s metabolic inhibitory properties its use as a 
pharmacokinetic enhancer of other protease inhibitors is the prevalent use of ritonavir in clinical 
practice (see section 4.2).
Effects on the Electrocardiogram  
QTcF interval was evaluated in a randomised, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily) 
controlled crossover study in 45 healthy adults, with 10 measurements over 12 hours on Day 3.  The 
maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) difference in QTcF from placebo was 5.5 (7.6) for 
400 mg twice daily ritonavir.  The Day 3 ritonavir exposure was approximately 1.5 fold higher than 
that observed with the 600 mg twice daily dose at steady state.  No subject experienced an increase in 
QTcF of  60 msec from baseline or a QTcF interval exceeding the potentially clinically relevant 
threshold of 500 msec.
Modest prolongation of the PR interval was also noted in subjects receiving ritonavir in the same study 
on Day 3.  The mean changes from baseline in PR interval ranged from 11.0 to 24.0 msec in the 12 
hour interval post dose.  Maximum PR interval was 252 msec and no second or third degree heart 
block was observed (see section 4.4).
Resistance
Ritonavir-resistant isolates of HIV-1 have been selected in vitro and isolated from patients treated with 
therapeutic doses of ritonavir.  
Reduction in the antiretroviral activity of ritonavir is primarily associated with the protease mutations 
V82A/F/T/S and I84V.  Accumulation of other mutations in the protease gene (including at positions 
20, 33, 36, 46, 54, 71, and 90) can also contribute to ritonavir resistance.  In general, as mutations 
associated with ritonavir resistance accumulate, susceptibility to select other PIs may decrease due to 
cross-resistance.  The Summary of Product Characteristics of other protease inhibitors or official 
continuous updates should be consulted for specific information regarding protease mutations 
associated with reduced response to these agents.
Clinical pharmacodynamic data
The effects of ritonavir (alone or combined with other antiretroviral agents) on biological markers of 
disease activity such as CD4 cell count and viral RNA were evaluated in several studies involving 
HIV-1 infected patients.  The following studies are the most important.
Adult Use
A controlled study completed in 1996 with ritonavir as add-on therapy in HIV-1 infected patients 
extensively pre-treated with nucleoside analogues and baseline CD4 cell counts  100 cells/l showed 
a reduction in mortality and AIDS defining events.  The mean average change from baseline over 16
weeks for HIV RNA levels was -0.79 log10 (maximum mean decrease: 1.29 log10) in the ritonavir 
group versus -0.01 log10 in the control group.  The most frequently used nucleosides in this study were 
zidovudine, stavudine, didanosine and zalcitabine. 
In a study completed in 1996 recruiting less advanced HIV-1 infected patients (CD4 200-500 cells/l) 
without previous antiretroviral therapy, ritonavir in combination with zidovudine or alone reduced 
viral load in plasma and increased CD4 count.  The mean average change from baseline over 48 weeks 
for HIV RNA levels was -0.88 log10 in the ritonavir group versus -0.66 log10 in the ritonavir + 
zidovudine group versus -0.42 log10 in the zidovudine group.
67
The continuation of ritonavir therapy should be evaluated by viral load because of the possibility of 
the emergence of resistance as described under section 4.1.
Paediatric Use
In an open label trial completed in 1998 in HIV infected, clinically stable children there was a 
significant difference (p = 0.03) in the detectable RNA levels in favour of a triple regimen (ritonavir, 
zidovudine and lamivudine) following 48 weeks treatment.
In a study completed in 2003, 50 HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitor and lamivudine naïve children age 
4 weeks to 2 years received ritonavir 350 or 450 mg/m2 every 12 hours co-administered with 
zidovudine 160 mg/m2 every 8 hours and lamivudine 4 mg/kg every 12 hours.  In intent to treat 
analyses, 72% and 36% of patients achieved reduction in plasma HIV-1 RNA of  400 copies/ml at 
Week 16 and 104, respectively.  Response was similar in both dosing regimens and across patient age.  
In a study completed in 2000, 76 HIV-1 infected children aged 6 months to 12 years who were 
protease inhibitor naive and naive to lamivudine and/or stavudine received ritonavir 350 or 450 mg/m2
every 12 hours co-administered with lamivudine and stavudine.  In intent to treat analyses, 50% and 
57% of patients in the 350 and 450 mg/m2 dose groups, respectively, achieved reduction in plasma 
HIV-1 RNA to ≤ 400 copies/ml at Week 48.
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
There is no parenteral formulation of ritonavir, therefore the extent of absorption and absolute 
bioavailability have not been determined.  The pharmacokinetics of ritonavir during multiple dose 
regimens were studied in non-fasting HIV-infected adult volunteers.  Upon multiple dosing, ritonavir 
accumulation is slightly less than predicted from a single dose due to a time and dose-related increase 
in apparent clearance (Cl/F).  Trough concentrations of ritonavir decrease over time, possibly due to 
enzyme induction, but appeared to stabilise by the end of 2 weeks.  The time to maximum 
concentration (Tmax) remained constant at approximately 4 hours with increasing dose.  Renal 
clearance averaged less than 0.1 l/h and was relatively constant throughout the dosage range.
The pharmacokinetic parameters observed with various dosing schemes of ritonavir alone are shown 
in the table below.  Plasma concentrations of ritonavir after administration of a single 100 mg dose 
tablet are similar to the 100 mg soft gelatin capsule under fed conditions.

Effects of food on oral absorption
Food slightly decreases the bioavailability of the Norvir tablet.  Administration of a single 100 mg 
dose of Norvir tablet with a moderate fat meal (857 kcal, 31% calories from fat) or a high fat meal 
(907 kcal, 52% calories from fat) was associated with a mean decrease of 20-23% in ritonavir AUC 
and Cmax.
68
Distribution
The apparent volume of distribution (VB/F) of ritonavir is approximately 20 - 40 l after a single 
600 mg dose.  The protein binding of ritonavir in human plasma is approximately 98 - 99% and is 
constant over the concentration range of 1.0 – 100 g/ml.  Ritonavir binds to both human alpha 1-acid 
glycoprotein (AAG) and human serum albumin (HSA) with comparable affinities.
Tissue distribution studies with 14C-labelled ritonavir in rats showed the liver, adrenals, pancreas, 
kidneys and thyroid to have the highest concentrations of ritonavir.  Tissue to plasma ratios of 
approximately 1 measured in rat lymph nodes suggests that ritonavir distributes into lymphatic tissues.  
Ritonavir penetrates minimally into the brain.
Biotransformation
Ritonavir was noted to be extensively metabolised by the hepatic cytochrome P450 system, primarily 
by the CYP3A isozyme family and to a lesser extent by the CYP2D6 isoform.  Animal studies as well 
as in vitro experiments with human hepatic microsomes indicated that ritonavir primarily underwent 
oxidative metabolism.  Four ritonavir metabolites have been identified in man.  The isopropylthiazole 
oxidation metabolite (M-2) is the major metabolite and has antiviral activity similar to that of parent
compound.  However, the AUC of the M-2 metabolite was approximately 3% of the AUC of parent
compound.  
Low doses of ritonavir have shown profound effects on the pharmacokinetics of other protease 
inhibitors (and other products metabolised by CYP3A4) and other protease inhibitors may influence 
the pharmacokinetics of ritonavir (see section 4.5).  
Elimination
Human studies with radiolabelled ritonavir demonstrated that the elimination of ritonavir was 
primarily via the hepatobiliary system; approximately 86% of radiolabel was recovered from stool, 
part of which is expected to be unabsorbed ritonavir.  In these studies renal elimination was not found 
to be a major route of elimination of ritonavir.  This was consistent with the observations in animal 
studies.
Special populations  
No clinically significant differences in AUC or Cmax were noted between males and females.  
Ritonavir pharmacokinetic parameters were not statistically significantly associated with body weight 
or lean body mass.  Ritonavir plasma exposures in patients 50 – 70 years of age when dosed 100 mg in 
combination with lopinavir or at higher doses in the absence of other protease inhibitors is similar to 
that observed in younger adults.
Patients with impaired liver function
After multiple dosing of ritonavir to healthy volunteers (500 mg twice daily) and subjects with mild to 
moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class A and B, 400 mg twice daily) exposure to ritonavir 
after dose normalisation was not significantly different between the two groups.  
Patients with impaired renal function
Ritonavir pharmacokinetic parameters have not been studied in patients with renal impairment.  
However, since the renal clearance of ritonavir is negligible, no changes in the total body clearance are 
expected in patients with renal impairment.
Paediatric patients
Ritonavir steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in HIV infected children above 2 
years of age receiving doses ranging from 250 mg/m² twice daily to 400 mg/m² twice daily.  Ritonavir 
concentrations obtained after 350 to 400 mg/m² twice daily in paediatric patients were comparable to 
those obtained in adults receiving 600 mg (approximately 330 mg/m²) twice daily.  Across dose 
69
groups, ritonavir oral clearance (CL/F/m2) was approximately 1.5 to 1.7 times faster in paediatric 
patients above 2 years of age than in adult subjects.
Ritonavir steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in HIV infected children less than 
2 years of age receiving doses ranging from 350 to 450 mg/m² twice daily.  Ritonavir concentrations in 
this study were highly variable and somewhat lower than those obtained in adults receiving 600 mg 
(approximately 330 mg/m²) twice daily.  Across dose groups, ritonavir oral clearance (CL/F/m2) 
declined with age with median values of 9.0 L/h/m2 in children less than 3 months of age, 7.8 L/h/m2
in children between 3 and 6 months of age and 4.4 L/h/m2 in children between 6 and 24 months of age.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Repeated dose toxicity studies in animals identified major target organs as the liver, retina, thyroid 
gland and kidney.  Hepatic changes involved hepatocellular, biliary and phagocytic elements and were 
accompanied by increases in hepatic enzymes.  Hyperplasia of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) 
and retinal degeneration have been seen in all of the rodent studies conducted with ritonavir, but have 
not been seen in dogs.  Ultrastructural evidence suggests that these retinal changes may be secondary 
to phospholipidosis.  However, clinical trials revealed no evidence of medicinal product-induced 
ocular changes in humans.  All thyroid changes were reversible upon discontinuation of ritonavir.  
Clinical investigation in humans has revealed no clinically significant alteration in thyroid function 
tests.  Renal changes including tubular degeneration, chronic inflammation and proteinurea were noted 
in rats and are felt to be attributable to species-specific spontaneous disease.  Furthermore, no 
clinically significant renal abnormalities were noted in clinical trials.
Developmental toxicity observed in rats (embryolethality, decreased foetal body weight and 
ossification delays and visceral changes, including delayed testicular descent) occurred mainly at a 
maternally toxic dosage.  Developmental toxicity in rabbits (embryolethality, decreased litter size and 
decreased foetal weights) occurred at a maternally toxic dosage.
Ritonavir was not found to be mutagenic or clastogenic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays 
including the Ames bacterial reverse mutation assay using S. typhimurium and E. coli, the mouse 
lymphoma assay, the mouse micronucleus test and chromosomal aberration assays in human 
lymphocytes.
Long term carcinogenicity studies of ritonavir in mice and rats revealed tumourigenic potential 
specific for these species, but are regarded as of no relevance for humans.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Norvir is and what it is used for
Norvir contains the active substance ritonavir.  Norvir is a protease inhibitor used to control HIV 
infection.  Norvir is used in combination with other anti-HIV medicines (antiretrovirals) to control 
your HIV infection.  Your doctor will discuss with you the best combination of medicines for you.
Norvir is used by children 2 years of age or older, adolescents and adults who are infected with HIV, 
the virus which causes AIDS.

medicine while you are taking Norvir. 
Also read the list of medicines under ‘Other medicines and Norvir’ for use with certain other 
medicines which require special care.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor before taking Norvir.
Important information
-
-
-
If Norvir is taken in combination with other antiretroviral medicines, it is important that you 
also carefully read the leaflets that are provided with these other medicines.  There may be 
additional information in those leaflets about situations when Norvir should be avoided.  If you 
have any further questions about Norvir (ritonavir) or the other medicines prescribed, please ask 
your doctor or pharmacist.
Norvir is not a cure for HIV infection or AIDS.
People taking Norvir may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV 
infection or AIDS.  It is therefore important that you remain under the supervision of your 
doctor while taking Norvir.
Tell your doctor if you have/had:
-
-
-
A history of liver disease.  
Hepatitis B or C and are being treated with a combination of antiretroviral agents, as you are at 
a greater risk of a severe and potentially life threatening reaction because of the effect on the 
liver.  Regular blood tests may be required to check your liver is working properly.
Haemophilia, as there have been reports of increased bleeding in patients with haemophilia who 
are taking this type of medicine (protease inhibitors).  The reason for this is not known.  You 
may need additional medicine to help your blood clot (factor VIII), in order to control any 
bleeding.
90
-
-
-
Erectile dysfunction, as the medicines used to treat erectile dysfunction can cause hypotension 
and prolonged erection.
Diabetes, as there have been reports of worsening of or the development of diabetes (diabetes 
mellitus) in some patients taking protease inhibitors.
Kidney (renal) disease, since your doctor may need to check the dose of your other medicines 
(such as protease inhibitors).
Tell your doctor if you experience:
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
Diarrhoea or vomiting that is not improving (persistent), as this may reduce how well the 
medicines you are taking work.
Feeling sick (nausea), vomiting or have stomach pain, because these may be signs of 
inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis).  Some patients taking Norvir can develop serious 
problems with their pancreas.  Tell your doctor as soon as possible if this applies to you.
Symptoms of infection – inform your doctor immediately.  Some patients with advanced HIV 
infection (AIDS) who then start anti-HIV treatment may develop the symptoms of infections 
they have had in the past even if they didn’t know they had had them.  It is believed that this 
happens because the body's immune response improves and helps the body to fight these 
infections.
In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when 
the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines 
for the treatment of your HIV infection.  Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after 
the start of treatment.  If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as 
muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of 
the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek 
necessary treatment.
Joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty 
moving, tell your doctor, as this may be a sign of a problem that can destroy bone 
(osteonecrosis).  Some patients taking a number of antiretroviral medicines may develop this 
disease. 
Muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly in combination with antiretroviral therapy 
including protease inhibitors and nucleoside analogues.  On rare occasions these muscle 
disorders have been serious. (See section 4. Possible side effects).
Dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting spells or abnormal heartbeat.  Some patients taking 
Norvir may experience changes in the electrocardiogram (ECG).  Tell your doctor if you have a 
heart defect or conduction defect.
If you have any other health concerns, discuss these with your doctor as soon as you can.
Children and adolescents
Norvir is not recommended in children below 2 years of age.
Other medicines and Norvir
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. There are some medicines you cannot 
take at all with Norvir.  These are listed earlier in section 2, under ‘Do not take Norvir’.  There are 
some other medicines that can only be used under certain circumstances as described below.
The following warnings apply when Norvir is taken as a full dose.  However, these warnings may also 
apply when Norvir is used in lower doses (a booster) with other medicines. 
91
Tell your doctor if you are taking any of the medicines listed below, as special care should be 
taken.
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
Sildenafil or tadalafil for impotence (erectile dysfunction).  
The dose and/or frequency of use of these medicines may need to be reduced to avoid 
hypotension and prolonged erection.  You must not take Norvir with sildenafil if you suffer from 
pulmonary arterial hypertension (see also section 2. What you need to know before you or 
your child takes Norvir).  Tell your doctor if you are taking tadalafil for pulmonary arterial 
hypertension.
Colchicine (for gout) as Norvir may raise the blood levels of this medicine.  You must not take 
Norvir with colchicine if you have kidney and/or liver problems (see also ‘Do not take Norvir’ 
above).
Digoxin (heart medicine).  Your doctor may need to adjust the dose of digoxin and monitor you 
while you are taking digoxin and Norvir in order to avoid heart problems.
Hormonal contraceptives containing ethinyl oestradiol as Norvir may reduce the effectiveness 
of these medicines.  It is recommended that a condom or other non-hormonal method of 
contraception is used instead.  You may also notice irregular uterine bleeding if you are taking 
this type of hormonal contraceptive with Norvir.
Atorvastatin or rosuvastatin (for high cholesterol) as Norvir may raise the blood levels of 
these medicines.  Talk to your doctor before you take any cholesterol-reducing medicines with 
Norvir (see also ‘Do not take Norvir’ above).
Steroids (e.g. dexamethasone, fluticasone propionate, prednisolone, triamcinolone) as Norvir 
may raise the blood levels of these medicines which may lead to Cushing’s syndrome 
(development of a rounded face) and reduce production of the hormone cortisol.  Your doctor 
may wish to reduce the steroid dose or monitor your side effects more closely.
Trazodone (a medicine for depression) as, unwanted effects like nausea, dizziness, low blood 
pressure and fainting can occur when taken with Norvir. 
Rifampicin and saquinavir (used for tuberculosis and HIV, respectively) as serious liver 
damage can occur when taken with Norvir.
Bosentan, riociguat (used for pulmonary arterial hypertension) as Norvir may increase the 
blood levels of this medicine.
There are medicines that may not mix with Norvir because their effects could increase or decrease 
when taken together.  In some cases your doctor may need to perform certain tests, change the dose or 
monitor you regularly.  This is why you should tell your doctor if you are taking any medicines, 
including those you have bought yourself or herbal products, but it is especially important to mention 
these:

Taking Norvir with food and drink
See section 3.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, it is very 
important that you ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.
There is a large amount of information on the use of ritonavir (the active ingredient in Norvir) during 
pregnancy.  In general, pregnant mothers received ritonavir after the first three months of pregnancy at 
a lower dose (booster) along with other protease inhibitors.  Norvir did not appear to increase the 
chance of developing birth defects compared to the general population.
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk.
If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as 
soon as possible.
Driving and using machines
Norvir can cause dizziness.  If you are affected do not drive or use machinery. 
3.
How to take Norvir
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you.  Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure.  Take this medicine one or two times a day every day with food.
For doses of exactly 100 mg amounts (100, 200, 300, 400, 500, or 600 mg) pour the entire content of 
each sachet over soft food (apple sauce or vanilla pudding) or mix with a small amount of liquid 
(water, chocolate milk, or infant formula) and consume entire serving.
For doses less than 100 mg amounts or doses between 100 mg amounts, the content of the entire 
sachet is to be mixed with a liquid and then dosed by the appropriate ml volume as told to you 
by your doctor using the oral dosing syringe. 
93
For administration using a feeding tube follow the instructions in section ‘How do I take the correct 
dose of Norvir powder for oral suspension mixed with liquid?’  Use water to mix the medicine and 
follow the feeding tube instructions to administer the medicine.
Recommended doses of Norvir are:


if Norvir is used to boost the effects of other anti-HIV medicines, the typical dose for adults is 1 
or 2 sachets once or twice daily.  For more detailed dose recommendations, including those for 
children, see the Package Leaflet of the anti-HIV medicines Norvir is given in combination 
with.
if your doctor prescribes a full dose, adults may be started on a dose of 3 sachets in the morning 
and 3 sachets 12 hours later, gradually increasing over a period of up to 14 days to the full dose 
of 6 sachets twice daily.  Children (2 – 12 years of age) will start with a dose smaller than this 
and continue up to the maximum allowed for their size.  
Your doctor will advise you on the dosage to be taken.
Norvir should be taken every day to help control your HIV, no matter how much better you feel.  If a 
side effect is preventing you from taking Norvir, tell your doctor straight away.  During episodes of 
diarrhoea your doctor may decide that extra monitoring is needed.
Always keep enough Norvir on hand so you don't run out.  When you travel or need to stay in the 
hospital, make sure you have enough Norvir to last until you can get a new supply.
Norvir powder for oral suspension has a lingering aftertaste.  Eating peanut butter, hazelnut chocolate 
spread, or black currant syrup immediately after taking the medication may help clear the aftertaste 
from your mouth. 
Prepare only one dose at a time using the correct number of sachets.  When mixing the powder with 
food or liquid, be sure to take the whole dose within 2 hours.  Do not mix Norvir with anything else 
without talking to your doctor or pharmacist.

If you take more Norvir than you should
Numbness, tingling, or a “pins and needles” sensation may occur if you take too much Norvir.  If you 
realise you have taken more Norvir than you were supposed to, contact your doctor or the Accident 
and Emergency Department of your nearest hospital straight away. 
If you forget to take Norvir
If you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as possible.  If it is nearly time for the next dose, just 
take that one.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
99
If you stop taking Norvir
Even if you feel better, do not stop taking Norvir without talking to your doctor.  Taking Norvir as 
recommended should give you the best chance of delaying resistance to the medicines.

Possible side effects
During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose.  This 
is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV 
medicines themselves.  Your doctor will test for these changes.
Like all medicines, Norvir can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  Also, the side 
effects of Norvir when used with other antiretroviral medicines are dependent on the other medicines.  
So it is important that you carefully read the side effects section of the leaflets that are provided with 
these other medicines.

Tell your doctor if you feel sick (nauseous), are vomiting, or have stomach pain, because these may be 
signs of an inflamed pancreas.  Also tell your doctor if you experience joint stiffness, aches and pains 
(especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty moving, as this may be a sign of 
osteonecrosis.  See also section 2. What you need to know before you or your child takes Norvir.
In patients with haemophilia types A and B, there have been reports of increased bleeding while taking 
this treatment or another protease inhibitor.  Should this happen to you, seek immediate advice from 
your doctor.  
Abnormal liver function tests, hepatitis (inflammation of the liver), and rarely jaundice, have been 
reported in patients taking Norvir.  Some people had other illnesses or were taking other medicines.  
People with liver disease or hepatitis may have worsening of liver disease.  
There have been reports of muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly when taking medicines 
to lower cholesterol in combination with antiretroviral therapy, including protease inhibitors and 
nucleoside analogues.  On rare occasions these muscle disorders have been serious (rhabdomyolysis).  
In the event of unexplained or continual muscle pain, tenderness, weakness or cramps, stop taking the 
medicine, contact your doctor as soon as possible or go to the Accident and Emergency Department of 
your nearest hospital.
Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience any symptoms that suggest an allergic 
reaction after taking Norvir such as rash, hives or breathing difficulties.
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, 
contact your doctor, pharmacist, Accident and Emergency department or if it is urgent get 
immediate medical help.
Reporting of side effects

medicine while you are taking Norvir.
Also read the list of medicines under ‘Other medicines and Norvir’ for use with certain other 
medicines which require special care.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor before taking Norvir.
Important information



If Norvir is taken in combination with other antiretroviral medicines, it is important that you 
also carefully read the leaflets that are provided with these other medicines.  There may be 
additional information in those leaflets about situations when Norvir should be avoided.  If you 
have any further questions about Norvir (ritonavir) or the other medicines prescribed, please ask 
your doctor or pharmacist.
Norvir is not a cure for HIV infection or AIDS.
People taking Norvir may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV 
infection or AIDS.  It is therefore important that you remain under the supervision of your 
doctor while taking Norvir.
105
Tell your doctor if you have/had:






A history of liver disease.  
Hepatitis B or C and are being treated with a combination of antiretroviral agents, as you are at 
a greater risk of a severe and potentially life threatening reaction because of the effect on the 
liver.  Regular blood tests may be required to check your liver is working properly.
Haemophilia, as there have been reports of increased bleeding in patients with haemophilia 
who are taking this type of medicine (protease inhibitors).  The reason for this is not known.  
You may need additional medicine to help your blood clot (factor VIII), in order to control any 
bleeding.
Erectile dysfunction, as the medicines used to treat erectile dysfunction can cause hypotension 
and prolonged erection.
Diabetes, as there have been reports of worsening of or the development of diabetes (diabetes 
mellitus) in some patients taking protease inhibitors.
Kidney (renal) disease, since your doctor may need to check the dose of your other medicines 
(such as protease inhibitors).
Tell your doctor if you experience:





-

Diarrhoea or vomiting that is not improving (persistent), as this may reduce how well the 
medicines you are taking work.
Feeling sick (nausea), vomiting or have stomach pain, because these may be signs of 
inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis).  Some patients taking Norvir can develop serious 
problems with their pancreas.  Tell your doctor as soon as possible if this applies to you.
Symptoms of infection – inform your doctor immediately.  Some patients with advanced HIV 
infection (AIDS) who then start anti-HIV treatment may develop the symptoms of infections 
they have had in the past even if they didn’t know they had had them.  It is believed that this 
happens because the body's immune response improves and helps the body to fight these 
infections.
In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when 
the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines 
for the treatment of your HIV infection.  Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after 
the start of treatment.  If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as 
muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of 
the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek 
necessary treatment.
Joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty 
moving, tell your doctor, as this may be a sign of a problem that can destroy bone 
(osteonecrosis).  Some patients taking a number of antiretroviral medicines may develop this 
disease. 
Muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly in combination with antiretroviral therapy 
including protease inhibitors and nucleoside analogues.  On rare occasions these muscle 
disorders have been serious. (See section 4 Possible side effects).
Dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting spells or abnormal heartbeat.  Some patients taking 
Norvir may experience changes in the electrocardiogram (ECG).  Tell your doctor if you have a 
heart defect or conduction defect.
If you have any other health concerns, discuss these with your doctor as soon as you can.
Children and adolescents
Norvir is not recommended in children below 2 years of age.
Other medicines and Norvir
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.  There are some medicines you cannot 
106
take at all with Norvir.  These are listed earlier in section 2, under ‘Do not take Norvir’.  There are 
some other medicines that can only be used under certain circumstances as described below.  
The following warnings apply when Norvir is taken as a full dose.  However, these warnings may also 
apply when Norvir is used in lower doses (a booster) with other medicines. 
Tell your doctor if you are taking any of the medicines listed below, as special care should be 
taken.









Sildenafil or tadalafil for impotence (erectile dysfunction).  
The dose and/or frequency of use of these medicines may need to be reduced to avoid 
hypotension and prolonged erection.  You must not take Norvir with sildenafil if you suffer 
from pulmonary arterial hypertension (see also section 2. What you need to know before you 
or your child takes Norvir). Tell your doctor if you are taking tadalafil for pulmonary arterial 
hypertension.
Colchicine (for gout) as Norvir may raise the blood levels of this medicine. You must not take 
Norvir with colchicine if you have kidney and/or liver problems (see also ‘Do not take Norvir’ 
above).
Digoxin (heart medicine).  Your doctor may need to adjust the dose of digoxin and monitor you 
while you are taking digoxin and Norvir in order to avoid heart problems.
Hormonal contraceptives containing ethinyl oestradiol as Norvir may reduce the effectiveness 
of these medicines.  It is recommended that a condom or other non-hormonal method of 
contraception is used instead.  You may also notice irregular uterine bleeding if you are taking 
this type of hormonal contraceptive with Norvir.
Atorvastatin or rosuvastatin (for high cholesterol) as Norvir may raise the blood levels of 
these medicines.  Talk to your doctor before you take any cholesterol-reducing medicines with 
Norvir (see also ‘Do not take Norvir’ above).
Steroids (e.g. dexamethasone, fluticasone propionate, prednisolone, triamcinolone) as Norvir 
may raise the blood levels of these medicines which may lead to Cushing’s syndrome 
(development of a rounded face) and reduce production of the hormone cortisol.  Your doctor 
may wish to reduce the steroid dose or monitor your side effects more closely.
Trazodone (a medicine for depression) as, unwanted effects like nausea, dizziness, low blood 
pressure and fainting can occur when taken with Norvir. 
Rifampicin and saquinavir (used for tuberculosis and HIV, respectively) as serious liver 
damage can occur when taken with Norvir.
Bosentan, riociguat (used for pulmonary arterial hypertension) as Norvir may increase the 
blood levels of this medicine.
There are medicines that may not mix with Norvir because their effects could increase or decrease 
when taken together.  In some cases your doctor may need to perform certain tests, change the dose or 
monitor you regularly.  This is why you should tell your doctor if you are taking any medicines, 
including those you have bought yourself or herbal products, but it is especially important to mention 
these:

There are some medicines you cannot take at all with Norvir.  These are listed earlier in section 2, 
under ‘Do not take Norvir’.
Taking Norvir with food and drink
Norvir tablets should be taken with food.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, it is very 
important that you ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.
There is a large amount of information on the use of ritonavir (the active ingredient in Norvir) during 
pregnancy.  In general, pregnant mothers received ritonavir after the first three months of pregnancy at 
a lower dose (booster) along with other protease inhibitors.  Norvir did not appear to increase the 
chance of developing birth defects compared to the general population.
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk.
If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as 
soon as possible.
Driving and using machines
Norvir can cause dizziness.  If you are affected do not drive or use machinery. 
Norvir contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’.
108
3.
How to take Norvir
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you.  Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure.  Take this medicine one or two times a day every day with food.  
It is important that Norvir tablets are swallowed whole and not chewed, broken or crushed.
Recommended doses of Norvir are:


if Norvir is used to boost the effects of certain other anti-HIV medicines the typical dose for 
adults is 1 to 2 tablets once or twice daily.  For more detailed dose recommendations, including 
those for children, see the Package Leaflet of the anti-HIV medicines Norvir is given in 
combination with.
if your doctor prescribes a full dose, adults may be started on a dose of 3 tablets in the morning 
and 3 tablets 12 hours later, gradually increasing over a period of up to 14 days to the full dose 
of 6 tablets twice daily (totaling 1,200mg per day).  Children (2 – 12 years of age) will start with 
a dose smaller than this and continue up to the maximum allowed for their size.  
Your doctor will advise you on the dosage to be taken.
Norvir should be taken every day to help control your HIV, no matter how much better you feel.  If a 
side effect is preventing you from taking Norvir as directed, tell your doctor straight away.  During 
episodes of diarrhoea your doctor may decide that extra monitoring is needed.
Always keep enough Norvir on hand so you don't run out.  When you travel or need to stay in the 
hospital, make sure you have enough Norvir to last until you can get a new supply.
If you take more Norvir than you should
Numbness, tingling, or a “pins and needles” sensation may occur if you take too much Norvir.  If you 
realise you have taken more Norvir than you were supposed to, contact your doctor or the Accident 
and Emergency Department of your nearest hospital straight away. 
If you forget to take Norvir
If you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as possible.  If it is nearly time for the next dose, just 
take that one.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you stop taking Norvir
Even if you feel better, do not stop taking Norvir without talking to your doctor.  Taking Norvir as 
recommended should give you the best chance of delaying resistance to the medicines.  
4.
Possible side effects
During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose.  This 
is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV 
medicines themselves.  Your doctor will test for these changes.
Like all medicines, Norvir can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  Also, the side 
effects of Norvir when used with other antiretroviral medicines are dependent on the other medicines.  
So it is important that you carefully read the side effects section of the leaflets that are provided with 
these other medicines.

Tell your doctor if you feel sick (nauseous), are vomiting, or have stomach pain, because these may be 
signs of an inflamed pancreas.  Also tell your doctor if you experience joint stiffness, aches and pains 
(especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty moving, as this may be a sign of 
osteonecrosis.  See also section 2. What you need to know before you or your child takes Norvir.
In patients with haemophilia type A and B, there have been reports of increased bleeding while taking 
this treatment or another protease inhibitor.  Should this happen to you, seek immediate advice from

Abnormal liver function tests, hepatitis (inflammation of the liver), and rarely jaundice, have been 
reported in patients taking Norvir.  Some people had other illnesses or were taking other medicines.  
People with liver disease or hepatitis may have worsening of liver disease.  
There have been reports of muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly when taking medicines 
to lower cholesterol in combination with antiretroviral therapy, including protease inhibitors and 
nucleoside analogues.  On rare occasions these muscle disorders have been serious (rhabdomyolysis).  
In the event of unexplained or continual muscle pain, tenderness, weakness or cramps, stop taking the 
medicine, contact your doctor as soon as possible or go to the Accident and Emergency Department of 
your nearest hospital.
Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience any symptoms that suggest an allergic 
reaction after taking Norvir such as rash, hives or breathing difficulties.
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, 
contact your doctor, pharmacist, Accident and Emergency department or if it is urgent get 
immediate medical help.

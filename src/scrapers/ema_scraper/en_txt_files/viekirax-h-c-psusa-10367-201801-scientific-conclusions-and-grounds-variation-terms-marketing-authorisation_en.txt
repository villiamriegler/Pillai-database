Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for ombitasvir / paritaprevir / 
ritonavir, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Based on the review of data presented in this PSUSA, covering the period from 15 January 2017 to 14 
January 2018, as well as cumulative data since the European birth date, the PRAC considers that the 
product information of medicinal products containing the active substances ombitasvir/ paritaprevir/ 
ritonavir should be updated as follows: update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to add diarrhoea with a 
frequency very common, vomiting with a frequency common and dehydratation with a frequency 
uncommon as adverse reactions identified with Viekirax in combination with dasabuvir and ribavirin. 
The package leaflet is updated accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir the CHMP is of the 
opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing ombitasvir / paritaprevir / 
ritonavir is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

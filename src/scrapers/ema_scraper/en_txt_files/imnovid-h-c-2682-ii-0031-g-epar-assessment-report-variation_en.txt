2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant disorder of plasma cells, characterized by uncontrolled and 
progressive proliferation of a plasma cell clone. The proliferation of myeloma cells causes displacement of 
the normal bone marrow leading to dysfunction in normal hematopoietic tissue and destruction of the 
normal bone marrow architecture, resulting in progressive morbidity and eventual mortality. 
MM is a heterogeneous disease in terms of response to treatment and survival. Prognostic features that 
contribute to this heterogeneity can be related to disease biology, patient characteristics (eg, age, frailty, 
and comorbidities), and prior treatment. The disease remains incurable using current therapies. 
Therefore, most patients experience disease relapse and will require multiple effective lines of therapy. 
Lenalidomide-based therapy is a major current standard of care in MM, and it is expected that the vast 
majority of patients will receive lenalidomide for the treatment of newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) and/or 
early relapsed refractory MM (RRMM). Consequently, the treatment where lenalidomide is no longer an 
option, including refractory patients, represent a clinically relevant population. Currently, there are no 
treatments that were developed specifically to address this patient population but there are still available 
treatment options for patients who are lenalidomide refractory (e.g. daratumumab or carfilzomib based 
regimens). 
Pomalidomide (POM) is an immunomodulatory agent whose mechanism of action is primarily mediated 
through direct antimyeloma tumoricidal and immunomodulatory activities. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/674052/2018  
Page 7/86 
 
 
 
 
Pomalidomide has direct anti-myeloma tumoricidal activity, immunomodulatory activities and inhibits 
stromal cell support for multiple myeloma tumour cell growth. Specifically, pomalidomide inhibits 
proliferation and induces apoptosis of haematopoietic tumour cells. Additionally, pomalidomide inhibits 
the proliferation of lenalidomide resistant multiple myeloma cell lines and synergises with 
dexamethasone in both lenalidomide sensitive and lenalidomide resistant cell lines to induce tumour cell 
apoptosis. Pomalidomide enhances T cell- and natural killer (NK) cell-mediated immunity and inhibits 
production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF α and IL 6) by monocytes. Pomalidomide also 
inhibits angiogenesis by blocking the migration and adhesion of endothelial cells. 
POM is currently approved in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with 
relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior treatment regimens, 
including both lenalidomide and bortezomib, and have demonstrated disease progression on the last 
therapy. 
The indication proposed by the MAH and approved by the CHMP is as follows: Imnovid in combination with 
bortezomib and dexamethasone is indicated in the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who 
have received at least one prior treatment regimen including Lenalidomide (SmPC, section 4.1).  
The recommended starting dose of Imnovid is 4 mg orally once daily on Days 1 to 14 of repeated 21-day 
cycles. 
Pomalidomide is administered in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone, as shown in Table 1. 
The recommended starting dose of bortezomib is 1.3 mg/m2 intravenous or subcutaneous once daily, on 
the days shown in Table 1. The recommended dose of dexamethasone is 20 mg orally once daily, on the 
days shown in Table 1. Treatment with pomalidomide combined with bortezomib and dexamethasone 
should be given until disease progression or until unacceptable toxicity occurs.

Molecular Mechanism of action 
Figure 1 Proposed mechanism of action of pomalidomide in multiple myeloma  
Pomalidomide has a dual mechanism of action, it is directly tumoricidal for MM cells, and it also has 
immunomodulatory activity with direct effects on T and NK-mediated immunity. 
Pomalidomide’s pleiotropic activities in a range of cell types including MM cells and immune effector cells 
suggests the existence of multiple molecular target molecules and downstream modulation of multiple 
molecular pathways.  
The molecular mechanism of action of pomalidomide has been investigated in MM cell lines and in primary 
tumor cells and human mononuclear cells. Pomalidomide inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a 
range of MM cell lines and this has been linked to its ability to induce tumor suppressor gene expression, 
caspase activation, and cell cycle arrest.   
In vitro activities of pomalidomide across multiple MM cell lines include effects on the cell cycle such as 
G0/G1 arrest associated with up-regulation of the cyclin- dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21WAF-1 
(Escoubet-Lozach, 2009), downregulation of translational checkpoint protein eIF4E and concomitant 
decrease in the protein level of C/EBPβ isoforms and downregulation of IRF4 (Li, 2011).  Interferon 
regulatory factor 4 is a critical factor for MM cell survival and IRF4 inhibition is toxic to myeloma cell lines.  
Consistent with a key role of IRF4 in MM cell survival, IRF4 expression has been found to correlate with 
poor clinical outcomes in several hematological malignancies (Iida, 1997; Shaffer, 2009).  In primary 
human monocytes and T cells, pomalidomide regulates activity of Rho GTPases and the formation of

F-actin through activating Rho guanosine-5'-triphosphate binding and hydrolyzing enzymes (GTPases) 
signaling with downstream effects on actin cytoskeleton, immune synapse formation and induction of 
IL-2 expression (Xu, 2009). 
The possibility of a common molecular mediator that is proximal to the downstream modulation of 
multiple signaling pathways was explored in various cell types.  The first suggestion of a common 
molecular mediator was the finding that thalidomide was shown to bind cereblon a protein responsible for 
the teratogenic effects of thalidomide in zebrafish and chicken embryos (Ito, 2010). Cereblon forms a 
ubiquitin E3 ligase complex with DDB1, CUL4 and protein Roc1 and thalidomide treatment has been 
shown to inhibit the ubiquitin ligase activity of the complex (Ito, 2010). E3 ubiquitin ligases are 
responsible for the poly-ubiquitination of a variety of substrate proteins.  Pomalidomide and lenalidomide 
are analogs of thalidomide.  It was showed that pomalidomide and lenalidomide bind human cereblon, 
and can modulate ubiquitination of substrates within the complex and that the expression of cereblon in 
myeloma cells is linked to both the efficacy of pomalidomide and lenalidomide and to the acquisition of 
resistance to lenalidomide (Report DM2528; Lopez-Girona, 2012). 
The affinities of pomalidomide and lenalidomide for binding to cereblon were similar (Report DM2528).  In 
U266 myeloma cell extracts, pomalidomide was shown to bind to the cereblon-DDB1 complexes (Report 
DM2528; Lopez-Girona, 2012).  Both pomalidomide and lenalidomide competed for thalidomide analog 
bead binding with potencies of ~2 μM, a concentration achieved clinically at peak exposure of effective 
lenalidomide concentrations (Chen, 2007).   
When cereblon levels were decreased transiently in myeloma cells by small interfering (si) ribonucleic 
acid against human cereblon, pomalidomide and lenalidomide were no longer able to inhibit proliferation 
and cell cycle progression.  Expression of wild-type cereblon in KMS12 myeloma cells enhanced the 
effects of pomalidomide to decrease expression of oncogenes c-myc and IRF4 and increase p21, effects 
that are abrogated by overexpression of a pomalidomide/lenalidomide binding defective mutant, 
FH-cereblonYW/AA.  In stable myeloma cell lines selected for 60% and 75% reduction of cereblon, the 
potency of pomalidomide antiproliferative activity was reduced but at high concentrations; notably, 
maximal proliferation inhibition, similar to that seen with the parental cell line, could be achieved.  In 
activated human T cells in which cereblon was transiently decreased, IL-2 and TNF-α induction by 
pomalidomide was markedly reduced.   
An important aspect of the clinical use of lenalidomide is that tumours can acquire resistance to 
lenalidomide efficacy over time (Bjorklund, 2011; Chen, 2007; Zhu, 2011).  This phenomenon was 
replicated with in vitro cell culture studies by long-term exposure to increasing concentrations of 
lenalidomide until the cells were resistant to antiproliferative effects up to 30 μM lenalidomide.  These 
results indicated that cereblon expression decreased concurrently with the decrease of efficacy of 
lenalidomide (Report DM2528) (Zhu, 2011).  However, pomalidomide maintained efficacy, although with 
somewhat lower potency, in these lenalidomide-resistant cells.   
Cereblon-mediated mechanisms at least partially explain the pleiotropic effects of pomalidomide, 
including inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, induction of tumor cell apoptosis, and activation of immune 
effector cells (Gandhi, 2014; Lopez-Girona, 2012; Zhu, 2011; Zhu, 2013).  The hematopoietic 
transcription factors, Aiolos and Ikaros, were first identified as cereblon substrate proteins degraded in 
tumour or immune cells in the presence of lenalidomide. Aiolos and Ikaros were initially discovered as 
regulators of T cells and are required for proper hematopoiesis, particularly lymphocyte development and 
plasma cell maturation (John, 2011). The expression of Aiolos and Ikaros is required for the proliferation 
of some MM cell lines (Krönke, 2014; Lu, 2014).  Upon binding to cereblon, lenalidomide and 
pomalidomide induce ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in a time- and 
concentration- dependent manner, leading to both direct cytotoxic and immunomodulatory effects 
(Bjorklund, 2015; Gandhi, 2014; Krönke, 2014; Lu, 2014).  In MM cells, degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/674052/2018

leads to decreased expression of IRF4 and c-Myc, cell-cycle arrest, decreased proliferation, and increased 
apoptosis (Bjorklund, 2015; Lopez-Girona, 2011; Lu, 2014). In MM.1S or U266 cells, short hairpin RNA 
(shRNA)-mediated knockdown of Ikaros and Aiolos was required to be sustained for more than 24 hours, 
to achieve effective downregulation of c- Myc and IRF4 levels (Bjorklund, 2015). 
Pomalidomide- and lenalidomide-induced degradation of these transcription factors in immune cells 
provides a mechanistic link for increased IL-2 production in T cells and activation of T, NK, and NKT cells 
(Gandhi, 2014; Hagner, 2015a; Ramsay, 2008; Schafer, 2003; Wu, 2008).  In primary human T cells 
treated with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, time-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros was 
observed as early as 1 hour after drug treatment, with stronger effect observed with pomalidomide as 
compared to lenalidomide.  In Lopez-Girona, 2012, culture with lenalidomide or pomalidomide enhanced 
IL-2 and TNF-α secretion by human T cells pre- cultured with phytohaemagglutinin for 24 hours and these 
effects were significantly reduced by knockdown of cereblon using shRNA.  Furthermore, ability of 
lenalidomide or pomalidomide to induce Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in T cells was abrogated in the 
presence of small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) targeting cereblon, confirming that lenalidomide 
and pomalidomide induce degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in a cereblon-dependent manner. 
Knockdown of Aiolos and Ikaros with siRNAs resulted to 61% and 67% decrease in the IL-2 messenger 
ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein, respectively, providing a mechanistic basis for lenalidomide and 
pomalidomide pharmacological effect in T cells (Gandhi 2014). 
Pomalidomide therapy led to reduction in the levels of Ikaros protein in T cells and NK cells in patients with 
relapsed lenalidomide-refractory MM, which was detected as early as 2 to 4 hours after dosing and was 
maximal 1 week after dosing (Sehgal, 2015).  Depletion of Ikaros in these patients correlated with 
changes in immune cell profile and function including an increase in circulating T cells and NK cells, 
increase in the expression of CD16, CD56, and NKG2D on NK cells, consistent with therapy-induced 
activation of NK cells, and increase in the production of cytokines by T cells and NK cells.  In patients 
treated with lenalidomide, decreased expression of Aiolos and Ikaros has also been observed in multiple 
cell types (including T and NK cells) (Gandhi, 2014; Hagner, 2015a).  The identification of Aiolos and 
Ikaros and characterization of their degradation in response to lenalidomide and pomalidomide provide 
additional insights into the molecular mechanisms of cytotoxicity and immunomodulation. 
Aiolos and Ikaros have now been identified as common substrate proteins in a variety of cell  types 
including MM, MDS, MCL, DLBCL, and T cells (Gandhi, 2014; Hagner, 2015; Hagner, 2015a; Krönke, 
2014; Lu, 2014).  However, additional substrates continue to be identified, which support the differential 
substrate hypothesis and provide insights into differential effects of lenalidomide and pomalidomide.  
ZFP91, a zinc finger protein and a putative ubiquitin ligase, was identified as a novel lenalidomide- and 
pomalidomide-dependent substrate (An, 2017).  Lenalidomide and pomalidomide promote binding of 
ZFP91 to cereblon, followed by ubiquitination and degradation in MM1.S cells in vitro.  When MM.1S cells 
were treated with increasing concentrations of thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide promoted 
ZFP91 degradation to a similar extent while thalidomide had a minimal effect 
Another substrate, casein kinase 1alpha (CK1α), was identified as a substrate of lenalidomide but not 
pomalidomide in del(5q) MDS (Krönke, 2015). Lenalidomide induces significant degradation of CK1α and 
that may underlie its clinical activity in MDS.  In contrast, Ikaros is a shared substrate between 
lenalidomide, pomalidomide, and thalidomide in MDS cells. Additionally, distinct kinetics of substrate 
degradation and downregulation of their downstream targets by lenalidomide and pomalidomide may, at 
least in part, underlie differential activity of these compounds. In the U266 cell line, pomalidomide was 
more effective than lenalidomide in triggering degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros 6 hours following 
treatment across a range of concentrations tested. Pomalidomide had a greater effect than lenalidomide 
on the rate of either Ikaros or Aiolos degradation and this correlated with its greater growth inhibitory 
effect (Bjorklund, 2015).

Cereblon, Aiolos, and Ikaros Gene Expression Studies 
In Heintel, 2013, cereblon expression was measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR) against cereblon exons 8 and 9 in 49 bone marrow samples of patients with newly diagnosed 
multiple myeloma (NDMM) treated with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone.  In this study, increased 
median cereblon mRNA expression correlated with treatment response such that the higher expression 
levels correlated with a better clinical response (i.e., median cereblon expression levels of 3.45, 3.75, 
2.01, 0.78 and 0.7 were associated with complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), 
partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD), respectively).  There were 
overlapping confidence levels within the defined thresholds such that the measurement of cereblon mRNA 
transcript levels were not clearly separated for the responses (e.g., the range of cereblon expression in 
the CR population is 0.81 to 7.26, VGPR is 0.6 to 28.74, PR is 0 to 6.7, SD is 0 to 2.37 and PD is 0.31 to 
1.09). Finally, the total bone marrow compartment was used to quantify the amounts of cereblon mRNA 
transcript, instead of purified CD138 positive MM cells. Schuster, 2014 measured cereblon gene 
expression using an Affymetrix GeneChip (Human Genome U133 + 2.0 array) from 53 MM patients 
relapsed/refractory to both lenalidomide and bortezomib who were then subsequently treated with 
pomalidomide plus dexamethasone.  To evaluate progression free survival and overall survival with 
cereblon expression data, this investigation utilized a quartile analysis system where quartile cut-off 
points for cereblon normalized median expression was defined as cereblon < 0.889 (Q1), cereblon < 
1.027 (Q2) and cereblon > 1.027 (Q3 and Q4) was defined.  The results indicated lower clinical response 
for those patients who expressed less than the normalized median cereblon expression in lowest quartile 
(Q1) than those in the upper three quartiles (Q2-Q4) (~10% vs. 40% respectively; p= not significant).  
Schuster, 2014 reported that measurement of low cereblon expression significantly correlated with 
progression free survival (3.0 vs. 8.9 mos) and overall survival (9.1 vs. 27.2  mos).  In contrast, Heintel, 
2013 found no significant correlation between cereblon expression and progression free survival or 
overall survival, highlighting the variability in the technical and analytical approaches of these two 
studies. 
Broyl, 2013 measured cereblon gene expression using an Affymetrix GeneChip (Human Genome U133 + 
2.0 array) from 95 bone marrow samples from MM patients on thalidomide maintenance. The results 
indicated that cereblon gene expression significantly correlated with an extended progression free 
survival; however, there was no association with an upgrade of response. Interestingly, Broyl, 2013 did 
not use a validated Affymetrix assay test, the quartile cut-off algorithm presented by Schuster, 2012 and 
later published (Schuster, 2014), although both groups used the same gene expression assay based on 
the same Affymetrix probes for their analysis.  
Neri, 2013 performed quantitative RT-PCR targeting cereblon exons 8-9 and exons 10-11 on 17 MM 
patients prior and after disease progression on a lenalidomide-based regimen, thereby classifying these 
patients as having acquired resistance to lenalidomide. The result showed that low cereblon mRNA 
significantly correlated with shorter progression free survival and a lack of lenalidomide response. 
In a study by Huang, 2014, immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was performed on cereblon protein in 
paraffin-embedded bone marrow sections from 40 relapsed/refractory (RR) MM patients receiving 
lenalidomide plus dexamethasone, 45 NDMM patients who received thalidomide plus dexamethasone, 
and 22 NDMM patients who received melphalan plus bortezomib and prednisolone. The IHC scoring 
method used diffuseness and the intensity of positively stained malignant plasma cells with a range from 
0 to 8, with a defined cut-off of ≥ 4.5 as a determination of a cereblon positive (CRBN+) patient and < 4.5 
as a cereblon negative (CRBN-) patient.  In both the lenalidomide plus dexamethasone and the 
thalidomide plus dexamethasone cohorts, the investigators found that the overall response rates were 
higher in CRBN+ patients versus those determined to be CRBN- (79% vs. 33% and 75% vs. 29% 
respectively). The particular anti- cereblon antibody utilized in this study is of low specificity.  In a study 
Assessment report

published by Gandhi, 2014a; the same antibody was examined by Western blot analysis where it was 
shown to have multiple non-specific bands for cereblon, suggesting that the total staining observed in 
these slides was not cereblon only, but contaminated with non-specific binding. The antibody was also 
found to be nonspecific in IHC testing (Ren, 2016). Additionally, even though a cut-off score of ≥ 4.5 
showed a higher overall response, it failed to identify all patients who would not respond to lenalidomide. 
This is highlighted by the observation that the only patient to achieve a CR in the cohort co-administered 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone had a cut-off score <4.5 and was therefore considered CRBN-. 
Additionally, another 28% of those considered to be CRBN- achieved at least a PR or better, further 
highlighting the difficulty in using this particular assay for its predictive value. 
A retrospective study by Zhu, 2014 investigated Ikaros and Aiolos gene expression data from 44 patients 
with refractory MM treated with pomalidomide and dexamethasone. Quartile analysis of Ikaros and Aiolos 
gene expression data prior to therapy suggested that there was a better overall response in those 
expressing the highest levels of Ikaros, but that there was no correlation with Aiolos expression (Zhu, 
2014). 
Development of Analytical Assays and Retrospective Testing 
Celgene has developed analytically validated assays for cereblon, Aiolos, and Ikaros and performed 
retrospective testing. Specifically, Celgene developed a highly sensitive and specific anti-cereblon 
antibody (CRBN65), and an analytically validated semi-quantitative IHC assay using this antibody for 
detecting cereblon protein in patient samples (Gandhi, 2014a; Ren, 2016). This assay has been used in 
the analysis of clinical samples (pre-treatment bone marrow biopsy) from MM patients to investigate the 
potential role of cereblon level to response to lenalidomide or pomalidomide-based regimen (Kalff, 2015; 
Sehgal, 2015). 
Celgene validated assay for cereblon was utilized in an exploratory biomarker study conducted as a part 
of the Study CC-4047-MM-010 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pomalidomide in combination with 
low dose dexamethasone in a large cohort of subjects with RRMM. Objectives of the exploratory 
biomarker study included investigation of utility of several potential biomarkers as markers predictive of 
pomalidomide response or resistance.  Five biomarkers were chosen (cereblon, cMYC, IRF4, BLIMP1, and 
XBP1) and correlative analyses were conducted in 224 subjects.  Clinical responses were observed with all 
cereblon expression levels.  There was a trend in progression free survival (PFS; P = 0.038) and a 
potential trend in overall survival (OS; P = 0.059) in favor of high cereblon expressers; however, there 
was no notable difference in overall response rate (ORR).  Overall response rate (30%), median PFS (17.7 
weeks) and median OS (52.3 weeks) in low cereblon expressers were comparable to the intent-to-treat 
population (ORR, 33%; median PFS, 20.0 weeks; median OS, 51.7 weeks).  The results of this biomarker 
study, conducted with Celgene validated cereblon assay, do not support cereblon as a biomarker for 
selecting patients for pomalidomide therapy (Exploratory Biomarker Study, Clinical Study Report 
CC-4047-MM-010)1. 
Additionally, Celgene has developed novel, dual stain IHC assays for both Ikaros and Aiolos (with CD138) 
(Ren, 2016). A small study investigating alternative schedules of pomalidomide and dexamethasone 
found no correlation between levels of Ikaros or Aiolos as measured by this IHC assay (Sehgal, 2015). In 
a larger phase II study of lenalidomide maintenance following autologous stem cell transplant, IHC 
analysis found no correlation with Aiolos protein measurement on PFS or OS (Kalff, 2015). However, in 
the same study, they found that the highest quartile of Ikaros protein levels significantly correlated with 
an inferior PFS and OS (Kalff, 2015). Analysis of a public dataset of mRNA expression of either Ikaros or 
Aiolos showed no significant correlation with disease pathogenesis from healthy donors, to MGUS, 
smoldering myeloma, NDMM, or relapse and/or refractory MM (RRMM) (Bjorklund, 2015). Yet, dual-stain 
(CD138/Ikaros or CD138/Aiolos) immunohistochemistry analysis indicated a trending increase of Ikaros 
and a significant increase in Aiolos when comparing normal versus MM bone marrow.

2.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH was asked to provide suitable information on an experimentally derived n-octanol/water 
partition coefficient (log Kow) of pomalidomide in order to assess its PBT potential. The calculated 
n-octanol/water partition coefficient value of -1.16 was used in the environmental risk assessment (ERA) 
submitted in the original marketing authorization application (MAA) for pomalidomide  submitted on 29 
May 2012 (EMEA/H/C/2682/0000). The logKow for POM has also been determined experimentally, using 
a shake flask method. The derived logKow value was determined to be 0.58, with a standard deviation of 
0.02. 
2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The pleiotropic activities of pomalidomide on a range of cell types including MM cells and immune effector 
cells suggested modulation of multiple molecular pathways. Indeed, activity of pomalidomide and 
lenalidomide are cell type- and context-dependent (Bartlett, 2004; Escoubet-Lozach, 2009; Hayashi, 
2005; Lu, 2009; Teo, 2005; Xu, 2009; Zhu, 2008). Activities included effects on the cell cycle such as 
G0/G1 arrest associated with the upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21WAF-1 
(Escoubet-Lozach, 2009), downregulation of the expression of IRF4 in both MM cell lines (Li, 2011), and 
modulation of Rho guanosine-5'- triphosphate binding and hydrolyzing enzymes (GTPases) which are 
critical for actin hyperpolymerization and immune synapse formation (Xu, 2009).  
From a technical perspective, the use of Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays for absolute measurement of a 
specific mRNA transcript is not considered a robust approach. In practice, microarrays serve more 
accurately to measure relative levels of mRNA transcripts in comparison to a reference point, rather than 
background. Also, the well published difficulties of DNA microarray technology, including accuracy, 
precision, and specificity would suggest that there is too much variability associated in the data output 
and therefore the weight given to the analysis of that data. In consideration of these technical challenges, 
the cut-offs retrospectively determined by Schuster, 2014 are narrow and overlapping, making it difficult 
to assess the predictive value of cereblon in larger prospective trials. 
There are multiple limitations of with measuring cereblon, Aiolos, and Ikaros mRNA or protein levels to 
correlate with clinical outcome. First, cereblon mRNA levels and protein levels do not correlate in cell lines 
(Gandhi, 2014a).  In 12 MM cell lines, both mRNA and protein levels of cereblon was compared to their 
relative sensitivity to lenalidomide. There is also no correlation between the level of mRNA or protein of 
cereblon within any cell line or between two cell lines. Both high and low levels of cereblon was seen to 
correlate with sensitivity to drug treatment. In addition, use of whole bone marrow cells rather than CD 
138+ MM cells will also confound the results. Therefore, it is imperative to detect cereblon protein in 
CD138+ MM cells in any correlation analysis. 
Second, Celgene and others have shown that splice variants of cereblon exist in primary MM cells 
(Gandhi, 2014a; Lode, 2013).  Therefore, the commercial quantitative RT-PCR primers used by Heintel, 
2013 and Broyl, 2013 only target select cereblon isoforms and may lead to an imprecise measurement of 
Assessment report

Page 14/86 
 
 
 
cereblon expression. Similarly, there are also multiple splice isoforms of Aiolos and Ikaros which make 
precise measurements of expression challenging (Rebollo, 2003; Matulic, 2010). 
Third, antibody quality for IHC further complicates interpretation of this assay for quantitative 
measurement of cereblon protein (Gandhi, 2014a). Commercially available antibodies for Aiolos and 
Ikaros are limited, but there are antibodies suitable for Western blot analysis; however, the presence of 
non-specific bands makes them unsuitable for IHC or flow cytometry (Celgene, unpublished data). 
Beyond the technical limitations mentioned above, the diagnostic assessment of cereblon for response or 
resistance is further complicated by a number of clinical considerations. First, MM treatment regimens are 
becoming more combination-based with an increasing use of novel agents in addition to IMiDs 
compounds. Thus, cereblon measurement would have to be examined in the combination setting in 
randomized control trials to ascertain its true utility. 
Second, the disease stage (newly diagnosed vs. relapsed/refractory) presents another complexity, as the 
natural history of the disease plays a role in response to therapy. And finally, other members of the CRL4 
E3 ligase complex, DDB1, Roc1 or Cullin4 and the substrates for the IMiDs compounds may have a 
significant role in determining response/resistance to IMiDs compound therapy. Proper understanding of 
the role of cereblon measurement in the clinic will emerge from addressing the technical as well as these 
clinical considerations in the future. 
Any assessment of cereblon expression to predict individual patients’ response to lenalidomide and 
pomalidomide therapy would require standardized reagents and assays.  The complexity of cereblon, 
Aiolos and Ikaros gene expression given the splice variants warrants more than a simple quantitative 
RT-PCR assay. 
The possibility was explored that a common molecular mediator exists that is proximal to the downstream 
modulation of multiple signaling pathways involved in the inhibition of proliferation, induction of apoptosis 
in tumour cells, and in the activation of immune effector cells.  Human cereblon has been identified as one 
common molecular mediator and both pomalidomide and lenalidomide bind human cereblon with similar 
affinities and the expression of cereblon in myeloma cells is linked to both the efficacy of pomalidomide 
and lenalidomide and to the acquisition of resistance to lenalidomide (Report DM2528). Cereblon directly 
binds DNA-DDB1 in a DDB1-CUL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and pomalidomide and lenalidomide 
binding to cereblon alters the function of the cereblon associated E3 ubiquitin ligase (Lopez-Girona, 2012; 
Zhu, 2011). Cytotoxic and immunomodulatory activities of pomalidomide and lenalidomide are linked to 
cereblon-dependent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of substrate proteins Aiolos and Ikaros 
and rate of substrate degradation underlies, at least in part, the differential activity of lenalidomide and 
pomalidomide (Bjorklund, 2015; Gandhi, 2014; Krönke, 2014; Lu, 2014; Krönke, 2015). 
The non-clinical results presented support the proposed update of section 5.1 of the SmPC with regard to 
the mechanism of action:  “Pomalidomide binds directly to the protein cereblon (CRBN), which is part of 
an E3 ligase complex that includes deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage-binding protein 1(DDB1), cullin 
4 (CUL4), and regulator of cullins-1 (Roc1), and can inhibit the auto-ubiquitination of CRBN within the 
complex. E3 ubiquitin ligases are responsible for the poly-ubiquitination of a variety of substrate proteins, 
and may partially explain the pleiotropic cellular effects observed with pomalidomide treatment. 
In the presence of pomalidomide in vitro, substrate proteins Aiolos and Ikaros are targeted for 
ubiquitination and subsequent degradation leading to direct cytotoxic and immunomodulatory effects. In 
vivo, pomalidomide therapy led to reduction in the levels of Ikaros in patients with relapsed 
lenalidomide-refractory multiple myeloma’’. 
Since the calculated value of logKow is -1.16 and the experimentally derived value of logKow has been 
determined to be 0.58 for POM, and both values are far below the action limit of 4.5, a persistent,

bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT) assessment is not triggered for pomalidomide. Based on currently 
available data it is concluded that pomalidomide is of no concern for the environment.

Pharmacokinetic results of the pomalidomide from maximum tolerated dose determination 
cohorts and the exploratory subcutaneous BTZ cohort 
MTD determination cohorts and the exploratory SC BTZ Cohort 
The plasma concentration versus time profiles from the MTD determination cohorts and the exploratory 
SQ BTZ cohort were characterized by an absorption phase with median Tmax ranging from 1.8 to 4.0 
hours post-dose. Pomalidomide exposures for both AUC0-t and Cmax appeared to increase in a dose 
dependent manner over the 1 to 4 mg dose range. Mild to moderate between-subject variability is noted 
for both AUC0-t and Cmax with values ranging from 16.7% to 54.21%.

Pharmacokinetic results of pomalidomide from the maximum tolerated dose confirmation 
cohort 
The pomalidomide plasma concentration versus time profiles from the maximum tolerated dose 
confirmation cohort were characterized by an absorption phase with Tmax ranging from 0.5 to 6.0 hours. 
Following attainment of Cmax, plasma concentrations of pomalidomide appeared to decline in a 
mono-phasic manner. The mean t1/2 was 7.12 hours. The mean CL/F was 5.75 L/h. In general, as

Table 3 Summary of Pomalidomide Plasma PK Parameters of Cohort 6 (MTD Confirmation 
Cohort) (PK Population) (Study CC-4047-MM-005) 
Additional pharmacokinetic data based on a population-PK (pop-PK) analysis, using a one-compartmental 
model was submitted. The pop-PK included combined data from 294 patients from studies MM-005 
(n=34) and MM-007 (n=260).  
Table 4 Population PK parameters of pomalidomide derived from the final PK model 
The pomalidomide PK has been characterized in a previously submitted PPK model (Clinical PK/PD 
Report: CC-4047-MPK-001, procedure EMEA/H/C/2628/II/003 submitted 10 Dec 2013) based on 
cumulative intensive and sparse PK data collected from multiple studies in both healthy subjects and 
patients. The results of a  PPK analysis, based on data from the CC-4047-MM-005 study and the 
CC-4047-MM-007 study, (exploring Bayesian individual clearance/exposure based on sparse PK data for 
exposure-response analysis), supporting the proposed dosage for the pomalidomide/bortezomib/ 
dexamethasone (PVd) regimen is provided below.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new data have been submitted. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
No new data have been submitted. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Based on the PK data, pomalidomide exposures increased in a dose dependent manner over the studied 
dose range. Pomalidomide AUC and Cmax appeared comparable between the IV- and SC-administered 
BTZ, whereas the Tmax was variable indicating that there is no meaningful impact of BTZ route of 
administration on POM exposure. Both routes of administration (IV and SC) were used in the pivotal study 
for BTZ.  
The main objective of the population PK analysis was to explore individual exposure using sparse PK data 
for further exposure-response (ER) analysis to support the proposed dose in the current therapeutic 
regimen. A small number of subjects (N = 34) contributed limited PK data leading to some bias in the 
goodness-of-fit for predictions of pomalidomide concentrations at certain earlier points (i.e. absorption 
phase). The one-compartmental model provided better minimization and more reliable parameter 
estimates. Additionally, the applicant supplemented the previous two-compartmental model with the 
current data and showed that the new parameter estimates were generally comparable to those from the 
previous population PK analysis. This confirms that the current pomalidomide PK data is in good 
agreement with the previously submitted population pharmacokinetics model. The high ETA shrinkage 
observed for the parameter V1/F had no impact on the population PK analysis as the applicant used other 
methods (e.g. objective function) to evaluate the covariate analysis. The estimated apparent clearance 
(CL/F) varied between studies and it was ranging from 5.38 to 9.85 in the previous studies in healthy 
normal subjects. Although the apparent clearance estimates from the final popPK model (i.e. 5.6 L/h) is 
within the lower end of this range, this issue is not further pursued considering the relatively wide 
therapeutic index and the relatively wide safety margin for pomalidomide treatment. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the clinical pharmacology data submitted support the new combination. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study (MM-005) 
This was a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) for the combination of pomalidomide, bortezomib and low-dose dexamethasone in subjects 
with RRMM. 
Objectives: 
Primary: To determine the MTD for the combination of pomalidomide + intravenous bortezomib + 
low-dose dexamethasone (Pom + IV BTZ + LD-dex) in subjects with RRMM. 
Secondary: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of Pom + IV BTZ + LD-dex  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/674052/2018  
Page 23/86 
 
 
 
Exploratory: pharmacokinetics (PK) of POM when administered with BTZ and LD-dex; additional efficacy 
parameters; safety for the combination of Pom + BTZ + LD-dex when bortezomib is administered 
subcutaneously. 
Methods 
A 3 + 3 design was utilized to determine the MTD for Pom + IV BTZ + LD-dex combination treatment in 
a 21-day treatment cycle. Subjects were treated in 21-day cycles until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity.  
Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were assessed to determine MTD during the first treatment cycle. Once the 
MTD was determined or the maximum planned dose (MPD) was reached without reaching MTD, a cohort 
of 6 additional subjects was treated at this MTD/MPD level to further confirm the safety and assess 
preliminary efficacy.  An additional cohort of 12 subjects was enrolled to explore the safety for the 
combination when using SQ BTZ. For this cohort, DLTs were assessed in the first treatment cycle, and the 
safety data were reviewed after subjects had completed 3 treatment cycles.

Results 
Analysis Populations 
Table 9. Analysis populations (Study MM-005) 
Baseline Characteristics 
The majority of subjects were male (58.8%) and white (91.2%); the median age for the overall 
population was 58.5 years (min, max: 36, 76 years) and approximately 6% of subjects were ≥  75 years. 
The median number of prior anti-myeloma regimens was 3. The majority had baseline MM International 
Stage I (35.3%) or Stage II (20.6%) MM. The median time since diagnosis was 3.4 years. All subjects 
were either ECOG performance status 0 (55.9%) or 1 (44.1%) at baseline. All subjects had prior exposure 
to lenalidomide and were refractory to lenalidomide, with 70.6% refractory to lenalidomide on their last 
regimen. Bortezomib was administered to 97.1% of subjects previously. All subjects had PD after their 
last myeloma regimen and the majority (91.2%) had progressed ≤  60 days after their last regimen.The 
majority of subjects were non-high risk for cytogenetic abnormalities. Mean (± SD) baseline 
beta-2-microglobulin was 2.9 (± 1.37) mg/L and serum creatinine was 80.6 (22.13) μmol/L. 
MTD for the combination treatment 
The combination of pomalidomide 4 mg/bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2/dexamethasone 20 mg (10 mg for 
subjects > 75 years of age) was the MPD (Cohort 5). DLTs did not occur at any dose level. 
Efficacy results (2 Apr 2015 data cut off) 
Table 10 Response Rates (Best Response Assessment Using IMWG Criteria) (EE 
Population-Study MM-005) 
For subjects who had at least PR for the EE population (n=22) median time to response was 4.2 weeks 
(min, max: 3.0, 22.1 weeks) and median duration of response was 32.3 weeks (95% CI: 19.3, 41.7). 
For all cohorts (n=34), median PFS was 31.6 weeks (95% CI: 20.1, 41.7) by IMWG Criteria (EE 
Population) and median time to progression was 31.9 weeks (95% CI: 20.1, 41.7).

Based on a cutoff date of 02 Apr 2015, 11 (32.4%) subjects had died. Median OS time from Kaplan-Meier 
estimates has not been reached, but would be expected to be at least 96 weeks, the lower boundary of 
the 95% CI. 
Safety 
The most commonly reported (≥ 20% of subjects) adverse events in clinical studies of bortezomib 
included nausea, diarrhoea, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, peripheral neuropathy, leukopenia, and 
lymphopenia. With the addition of pomalidomide, these AEs did not appear to increase in frequency, and 
in general, occurred at incidence rates between 26.5% (thrombocytopenia) and 38.2% (peripheral 
sensory neuropathy).

approximately 33% increase in median with 80% power. To obtain PFS events from approximately 70% 
of the ITT population for the final PFS analysis, a total of 544 subjects were required to be randomized 
(1:1 ratio). 
The MAH amended the protocol in Amendment 5 to perform the final PFS analysis earlier due to recently 
published data from several Phase 3 studies that revealed that the PFS of the BTZ + LD-DEX arm, which 
requires prior treatment with LEN, was expected to be shorter than the original assumptions of 9 months 
(relevant median PFS data for BTZ + LD-DEX from Phase 3 Endeavor, Panorama-1 and Castor studies 
ranging from 7 to 8 months) (Moreau, 2017a; Palumbo, 2016; San-Miguel, 2014). The data cut-off date 
for the revised final PFS analysis was October 2017, with approximately 320 PFS events projected to be 
reached, representing an approximate 57% event rate (out of 559 randomized subjects) and 80% power 
to test a HR of 0.73 (estimated median PFS of 12 months in the POM + BTZ + LD-DEX arm and 8.8 
months in the BTZ + LD-DEX arm). 
For OS, with the assumption of 2-sided significance level of 0.05 and 1 planned interim analyses at the 
time of the final PFS analysis, a total of 379 deaths are required to detect approximately 33% increase in 
median OS (30 to 40 months) with 75% power. The projected events at the time of the OS interim 
analysis was approximately 50% (191 events). 
Randomisation 
Randomization was done by a validated interactive response technology system, using randomly 
permutated blocks within strata, by the following baseline stratification factors: 
•  Age (≤ 75 years versus > 75 years) 
•  Number of prior anti-MM regimens (1 versus > 1) 
• 
β2M at screening (< 3.5 mg/L versus ≥  3.5 mg/L - ≤  5.5 mg/L versus > 5.5 mg/L) 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was open-label.   
Statistical methods 
The efficacy analyses include 1 interim analysis and 1 final analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint, PFS, 
as well as 1 interim analysis and 1 final analysis for the key secondary endpoint, OS. Type 1 error was 
controlled for these endpoints and analyses.  
1. Intent-to-treat population (ITT): all subjects who were randomized, independent of whether they 
received study treatment. It was used for the primary efficacy analysis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/674052/2018  
Page 33/86 
 
 
 
2. Safety population: all randomized subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug (either POM or 
BTZ or LD-DEX).  
3. Efficacy evaluable population (EE): randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug, 
had measurable disease at baseline, and had at least 1 valid post-baseline myeloma response 
assessment. It was used for exploratory analysis. 
Interim analysis 
An  analysis of PFS was to be performed when approximately 191 PFS events would have been observed. 
A non-binding stopping boundary was to be applied based on gamma function with gamma = -6. If the 
p-value of the 2-sided log-rank test for PFS was greater than 0.932, then the futility boundary was 
crossed. 
The ORR analysis and the OS analysis were to be performed with the final PFS analysis in the step-down 
fashion. The family-wise type I error rate was to be controlled by a step-down approach from PFS to ORR 
and then to OS comparison.  
If the OS analysis crossed the superiority boundary, the OS results would be considered significant in 
favour of POM + BTZ + LD-DEX. Otherwise the final OS analysis would be performed when 379 deaths are 
observed. The OS comparison between treatment arms was conducted in which a group sequential test 
with an overall Type I error probability of 0.05 (two-sided). 
Table 11 Nominal Two-Sided P-Value for Rejecting Null (Superiority) for PFS, ORR and OS 
Analysis (Pocock Type Alpha Spending) 
Efficacy analyses 
The primary efficacy analysis for all endpoints was to be performed based on the ITT population. 
Exploratory analysis for PFS, ORR and OS were to be performed using the EE population for the final 
analyses.  
For analysis of endpoints with alpha control, statistical tests were to be performed at the 2-sided 
significance level of 0.05. 
Analysis of primary endpoint (PFS assessed by IRAC based on IMWG criteria) was to be calculated using 
the FDA censoring rules (2007). Additional analysis of PFS by IRAC (EBMT criteria), investigator’s 
assessment (IMWG criteria only) and EMA censoring rules (2013) were also planned, the last two as 
sensitivity analysis. PFS was to be compared between treatment arms using a log-rank test stratified and 
Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the survival distribution for each arm. The median PFS along 
with the two-sided 95% CI for the median was to be estimated. A Cox proportional hazards model 
stratified by stratification factors was to be used to estimate hazard ratio along with 95% CIs. Unstratified 
log-rank test was performed as a secondary analysis for PFS. Additional analyses for PFS were to be 
conducted for all possible combinations of assessors (IRAC versus Investigator), criteria (IMWG versus 
EBMT) and censoring (FDA versus EMA versus sensitivity).

Amendment 1 (27 Mar 2014): 
Based on the safety, efficacy and PK data from SC BTZ cohort in Study MM-005 and 
o 
general adoption in medical practice of SC BTZ as standard of care due to decreased 
neurotoxicity, BTZ route of administration was updated from IV to SC in both treatment arms. 
Added exploratory assessments for QoL, biomarker sampling (MRD, genomic, 
o 
molecular/mechanistic and immune) and PFS2 
Amendment 2 (14 Nov 2014): 
o  Clarified that biomarker study was optional. 
o  Healthcare resource utilization measurements were added. 
Amendment 3 (16 Oct 2015): 
o  Statistical assumptions were revised by increasing the estimated PFS of arm A from 12 months to 
12.6 months (treatment difference increased from 33% to 40% over the control arm), and by 
reducing the study power from 90% to 85%, which resulted in a sample size reduction from 
approximately 782 subjects to 450 subjects. 
o  Timepoints for contraceptive requirements and pregnancy testing for FCBP were updated to be 
consistent with pomalidomide and bortezomib prescribing information. 
Amendment 4 (9 Dec 2015): 
o  Revisions were made to the overall sample size: 
- 
 The revised sample size assumed a median PFS of 9 months in the arm B versus 12 months 
in arm A with 80% power at a 2-sided significance level of 5%. This change required 381 PFS 
events and a total of 544 subjects to be enrolled for an approximate 70% event rate. 
- 
- 
The interim PFS analysis was to occur when 50% PFS information (191 events) had occurred. 
The interim OS analysis was to occur when 50% OS information (191 deaths) had occurred. 
Amendment 5 (14 Jun 2017): 
Due to recently published data from several Phase 3 studies the PFS of arm B was expected to be shorter 
than the original assumption of 9 months (median PFS from Phase 3 ENDEAVOR, PANORAMA-1 and 
CASTOR studies ranging from 7 to 8 months) (Moreau, 2017a; Palumbo, 2016; San-Miguel, 2014). 
Subsequently, the data cutoff date for the revised final PFS analysis was October 2017, by which time 
approximately 320 PFS events were projected to be reached, representing an approximate 57% event 
rate (out of 559 randomized subjects). This would allow for 80% power to test a hazard ratio of 0.73 (with 
an estimated median PFS of 12 months in the POM + BTZ + LD-DEX arm and 8.8 months in the BTZ + 
LD-DEX arm). 
Protocol violations were reported for 63 (11.3%) subjects (35 arm A (12.5%) and 28 arm B (10.1%)). 
The majority comprised SAEs submitted later than the required timing for 26 subjects (15 arm A and 11 
arm B), and Pomalidomide counselling not done in at least 1 visit for 25 subjects (13 arm A and 12 arm 
B).

Notes 
Subjects were stratified at randomization by age (≤ 75 years old versus > 75 
years old), number of prior anti-MM regimens (1 or >1), and baseline β2 
microglobulin(< 3.5 mg/L, ≥ 3.5 to ≤ 5.5 mg/L, and > 5.5 mg/L). 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
This application for a new indication of pomalidomide is supported by a single phase 3 trial (study MM-07) 
that was designed considering the recommended dose from an adequate phase 1 dose finding study 
MM-05. 
The design of the pivotal study is considered acceptable and the eligibility criteria reflect the intended 
patient population with RRMM who have received at least one prior regimen, including lenalidomide. The 
combination of BTZ with DEX is approved in the EU for the treatment of adults with progressive MM who 
have received at least 1 prior therapy and therefore it is an appropriate comparator. The choice of 
endpoints with PFS as primary is satisfactory and the duration of study sufficient for assessment.  
The methods, conduct, analysis and reporting of results from the pivotal study are appropriate and there 
are currently no concerns to trigger a GCP inspection. The sample size was amended several times during 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/674052/2018  
Page 57/86 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
this open label study; however these amendments were not based on internal data and are not 
considered to bias results. It should also be noted that the DMC conducted an interim analysis after 190 
events (blinded to the applicant) and the results are consistent with those of the final analysis at 323 
events, which provides reassurance that the estimate of treatment effect is not dependent on the final 
sample size used. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The pivotal study met its primary endpoint and showed a statistically significant PFS advantage in favour 
of POM+BTZ+LD-dex with a 39% reduction in risk of death or progression compared to the comparator 
(HR 0.61(0.49, 0.77, p<0.0001) supported by sensitivity analysis. The PFS advantage was more 
pronounced in patients with only one prior line of therapy (46% risk reduction) but this is expected as 
patients tend to become more refractory to new treatments as they receive further lines.  
It is clinically relevant that the PFS advantage was seen across subgroups of unfavourable prognosis (e.g. 
unfavourable cytogenetics), in particular in LEN refractory patients as this drug is widely used in regimens 
in front/earlier setting.  In addition, the PFS2 data showed a 24% risk reduction with POM combination 
indicating the POM combination does not increase resistance to further treatments. 
Results from response rate and other exploratory analysis are also favourable to POM combination. 
The interim OS analysis did not show any differences between arms, HR 0.98 (0.73, 1.32) but at the time 
of cut off 26 October 2017 data was not mature. An updated OS analysis based on event rate of 43.3% 
and after a median follow-up period of 26.2 months has shown a positive trend favouring 
POM+BTZ+LD-dex supportive of primary analysis. Overall survival data are still immature and the MAH 
will provide the final OS analysis in Q3 of 2021 tin order to confirm the benefit in terms of OS (see Annex 
II). 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The results of the pivotal trial MM-007 trial are considered of clinical relevance. The statistically significant 
and clinically relevant improvement in PFS support a clinical benefit associated with the addition of 
pomalidomide to standard of care regimen BTZ + LD-DEX in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma 
patients who have received LEN-based treatments earlier in their treatment pathway, including those

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Safety analyses were based on the safety population, which was defined as all randomized subjects who 
receive at least 1 dose of study drug (POM, BTZ, or LD-DEX). This safety evaluation included all safety 
data for the 548 subjects in the safety population as of the data cut-off date of 26 October 2017, including 
278 subjects in the POM + BTZ + LD-DEX arm and 270 in the BTZ + LD-DEX.

•  Neutropenia and thrombocytopaenia 
Table 43 TEAE of Interest – Neutropenia (Study CC-4047-MM-007) (Safety Population) 
In patients receiving combination therapy with pomalidomide in clinical studies, thrombocytopenia 
occurred in 27.0-36.7% of patients. Thrombocytopenia was Grade 3 or 4 in 20.7-27.3% of patients, led 
to pomalidomide discontinuation in 0.7% of patients and was serious in 0.4-1.7% of patients.  
• 
Infection 
In patients receiving combination therapy with pomalidomide in clinical studies, infection occurred in 
55.0-80.2% of patients (24.0-30.9% Grade 3 or 4). Upper respiratory tract infection and pneumonia 
were the most frequently occurring infections. Fatal infections (Grade 5) occurred in 2.7-4.0% of 
patients. Infections led to pomalidomide discontinuation in 2.0-2.9% of patients. 
•  Bleeding 
Haemorrhagic disorders have been reported with pomalidomide, especially in patients with risk factors 
such as concomitant medicinal products that increase susceptibility to bleeding. Haemorrhagic events 
have included epistaxis, intracranial haemorrhage and gastrointestinal haemorrhage. 
•  Venous Thromboembolic Events 
In patients receiving combination therapy with pomalidomide in clinical studies, venous thromboembolic 
events (VTE) occurred in 3.3-11.5% of patients (1.3-5.4% Grade 3 or 4). VTE was reported as serious in 
1.7-4.3% of patients, no fatal reactions were reported, and VTE was associated with pomalidomide 
discontinuation in up to 1.8% of patients. 
• 
Peripheral Neuropathy 
In study CC-4047-MM-007, peripheral neuropathy occurred in 55.4 % of patients who received 
pomalidomide in combination with bortezomib and low-dose dexamethasone (Pom+Btz+LD-Dex) and 
43.3% of patients receiving bortezomib and low-dose dexamethasone (Btz + LD-Dex). Peripheral 
neuropathy was reported as Grade 3 in 10.8% of patients in the Pom + Btz + LD-Dex arm and 5.2% in the 
Btz + LD-Dex arm. Grade 4 was reported infrequently; 0.7% of patients in Pom + Btz + LD-Dex arm and 
none in Btz + LD-Dex arm. Exposure-adjusted rates were comparable across treatment arms. 
Approximately 30% of the patients experiencing peripheral neuropathy had a history of neuropathy at 
baseline. Peripheral neuropathy led to discontinuation of bortezomib in approximately 12.9% of patients, 
pomalidomide in 1.8% and dexamethasone in 2.2 - 8.9% of patients, respectively.

Laboratory findings 
Hematology 
The percentages of subjects with Grade 3 or 4 hemoglobin, lymphocyte, and platelet values were similar 
in the POM + BTZ + LD-DEX and BTZ + LD-DEX treatment arms. Substantially higher percentages of 
subjects in the POM + BTZ + LD-DEX arm than in the BTZ + LD-DEX arm experienced Grade 3 leukocyte

and Grade 3 and Grade 4 neutrophil values. Neutropenia (PT) was reported as a TEAE in 130 (46.8%) 
subjects in the POM + BTZ + LD-DEX arm and 29 (10.7%) subjects in the BTZ + LD-DEX arm. 
Clinical Chemistry 
For most tests, the percentages of subjects with Grade 3 or 4 values were relatively low and similar in the 
2 treatment arms. Test with the largest differences in subjects with Grade 3 values between the POM + 
BTZ + LD-DEX and BTZ + LD-DEX treatment arms was calcium (14 subjects [5.1%] versus 4 subjects 
[1.5%]). 
One subject in the POM + BTZ + LD-DEX arm was reported with Grade 4 calcium at baseline; the value 
shifted to Grade 3 postbaseline. Two subjects in the POM + BTZ + LD-DEX arm were reported with Grade 
4 calcium corrected for albumin at baseline. The value shifted to Grade 3 postbaseline for 1 subject and 
the other subject had additional Grade 4 values postbaseline. One subject in the POM + BTZ + LD-DEX 
arm was reported with Grade 4 magnesium at baseline; the subject had additional Grade 4 readings 
postbaseline. Seven subjects in the POM + BTZ + LD-DEX arm and 2 subjects in the BTZ + LD-DEX were 
reported with Grade 4 urate at baseline. In the POM + BTZ + LD-DEX arm, the values shifted to normal 
postbaseline for 1 subject and Grade 1 postbaseline for 3 subjects. Three other subjects in the POM + BTZ 
+ LD-DEX arm and the 2 subjects in the BTZ + LD-DEX arm had additional Grade 4 values postbaseline. 
Safety in special populations 
No clinically meaningful differences were noted in the safety profile of POM + BTZ + LD-DEX when 
analyzed by age (≤ 75 years, > 75 years; ≤  65 years, > 65 years).

Table 47 TEAE Leading to Discontinuation of Pomalidomide in ≥1% of the Subjects by System 
Organ Class and Preferred Term (Study CC-4047-MM-007) (Safety Population) 
Post marketing experience 
Since the initial marketing authorization, 77,428 patients have been exposed to pomalidomide. The 
safety profile has been well defined in the RRMM population and is discussed in the most recent periodic 
safety update report (PSUR) (version 8) for the reporting period 8 February 2017 to 7 February 2018. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data from a total of 548 subjects were included in this report in order to evaluate the safety profile 
of POM together with standard background therapy, 278 subjects received POM in combination with 
standard background therapy (POM+BTZ+LD-DEZ) and 270 subjects received background therapy alone 
(BTZ+LD-DEX). The number of exposed subjects and degree of exposure is considered sufficient to 
evaluate the safety of POM in combination with the background therapies. 
Treatment was generally well tolerated and the median relative dose intensity was high for POM (0.8), 
and was comparable for both BTZ (0.8 versus 0.9) and DEX (0.8 vs 0.9) in the POM + BTZ + LD-DEX vs 
the BTZ + LD-DEX arm, respectively. Treatment duration of BTZ (33.0 versus 21.4 weeks) and DEX (34.0 
versus 21.2 weeks) was substantially longer in the POM + BTZ + LD-DEX arm compared to the BTZ + 
LD-DEX arm, indicating that triplet therapy allowed for longer usage and higher cumulative doses of BTZ 
and DEX. 
Overall, the most frequently reported ADRs (all grades) by preferred term in the POM + BTZ + LD-DEX 
arm were peripheral sensory neuropathy (47.8%), neutropenia (46.8%), fatigue (37.1%), 
thrombocytopenia and constipation (36.7% each), peripheral edema and diarrhea (33.8%). In the BTZ + 
LD-DEX arm, the 5 most frequently reported TEAEs were thrombocytopenia (38.1%), peripheral sensory 
neuropathy (37.0%), diarrhea (30.0%), anemia (27.0%), and fatigue (26.3%). 
Infections occurred frequently in both arms; 80.2% all grades and 30.9% Grade 3 or 4 in the POM + BTZ 
+ LD-DEX arm compared with 64.8% all grades and 17.8% Grade 3 or 4 in the BTZ + LD-DEX arm; 
however, exposure-adjusted rates were similar between the 2 treatment arms. Most subjects in both 
treatment arms who developed infections did not have a concurrent Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. Infections 
seldom led to treatment discontinuation or death during the treatment period. 
Neutropenia occurred more frequently in the POM + BTZ + LD-DEX arm; Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia 
occurring in 41.7% of subjects in the POM + BTZ + LD-DEX arm compared to the 8.5% in the BTZ + 
LD-DEX arm. The frequency of febrile neutropenia was low; 3.2% in the POM + BTZ + LD-DEX arm and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/674052/2018  
Page 74/86 
 
 
 
 
no recorded events in the BTZ + LD-DEX arm. Most subjects who developed a Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia 
did not develop concurrent infections in either arm. The frequency of thrombocytopenia was similar 
(36.7% in the POM + BTZ + LD-DEX arm compared with 39.3% in the BTZ + LD-DEX arm); and bleeding 
events occurred at similar rates between treatment arms (17.3% versus 15.9%, respectively). 
Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred most frequently in the first 2 cycles of treatment with 
pomalidomide. 
Peripheral neuropathy occurred more frequently in the POM + BTZ + LD-DEX arm (55.4%) compared to 
the BTZ + LD-DEX arm (43.3%); however, exposure-adjusted rates were comparable across treatment 
arms. Approximately 30% of the subjects experiencing PN already had a history of neuropathy at 
baseline. Peripheral neuropathy was reported as Grade 3 or 4 in relatively few subjects (11.5% and 5.2%, 
respectively). 
Venous thromboembolic events, including deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus, occurred 
more frequently in the POM + BTZ + LD-DEX arm than in the BTZ + LD-DEX arm (11.5% versus 2.6%). 
None of these events in either arm resulted in death. 
Cardiac arrhythmias occurred more frequently in the POM + BTZ + LD-DEX arm (15.8%) compared to the 
BTZ + LD-DEX arm (5.9%), driven primarily by atrial fibrillation (9.4% versus 1.9%, respectively). Grade 
3 or 4 atrial fibrillation occurred infrequently in both treatment arms (3.2% versus 0.7%). Most subjects 
who developed atrial fibrillation had a history of cardiac disorders, and/or other comorbidities that could 
increase the risk of developing atrial fibrillation. 
Ventricular arrhythmias were infrequently (< 1.0%) reported and at similar rates between treatment 
arms. 
In summary, 172 (31.4%) deaths occurred in the safety population over the entire study period, at a 
comparable rate across treatment arms (30.9% and 31.9%, respectively). The most common cause of 
death in both treatment arms was progression of MM; particularly plasma cell myeloma (18.0% and 
21.9% of subjects in the POM + BTZ + LD-DEX and BTZ + LD-DEX arms, respectively), and plasma cell 
leukemia and metastases to the meninges (due to MM) in 1 subject each for the POM + BTZ + LD-DEX 
arm. Death due to infections and infestations occurred in 5.4% and 4.8%, of subjects respectively, not 
unexpectedly as infection is the leading cause of death in patients with myeloma (Nucci, 2009). 
More deaths were reported during the treatment period in the POM + BTZ + LD-DEX arm compared with 
the BTZ + LD-DEX arm (9.7% versus 4.4%). This observation likely reflects the substantially longer 
treatment duration in the POM + BTZ + LD-DEX arm compared with the BTZ + LD-DEX arm (median 
treatment duration 38 weeks versus 21 weeks, respectively). In support of this observation, the incidence 
of all deaths and on-treatment deaths during the first 60 and 100 days of treatment were comparable 
across treatment arms. More deaths occurred during the follow-up phase in the BTZ + LD-DEX arm 
compared with the POM + BTZ + LD-DEX arm (74 [27.4%]) versus 59 [21.2%]), again potentially 
reflecting the difference in study treatment duration between arms. Most of these deaths were due to 
plasma cell myeloma. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of POM + BTZ + LD-DEX was consistent with the well-established safety profiles of each 
drug in the triplet therapy. There is no new safety concern arising from the data in the new population of 
RRMM patients after at least one prior treatment. Toxicities were generally manageable with dose 
reductions and interruptions, and study drug discontinuations due to AEs were infrequently reported. 
Data from POM + BTZ + LD-DEX define a manageable safety profile with no clinically relevant differences 
from the current product information for POM + DEX and BTZ.

the MAH is not proposing any additional risk minimisation measures for the new indication, which is 
agreed. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. 
As a result the MAH submitted a request to add 14-capsule pack sizes for the 1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg and 4 mg 
Imnovid strengths to support the new proposed posology and pomalidomide dose modification which was 
accepted by the CHMP. The SmPC, Labelling and Package leaflet are updated in accordance. The RMP 
version 15.1 has also been updated. 
Update on Annex II to include post-authorisation efficacy study. 
In addition, changes related to section 5.1 of the SmPC have been made with regard to pomalidomide 
mechanism of action based on literature data. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
MAH show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Pomalidomide is currently approved in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of RRMM after 
at least two prior regimens, including both lenalidomide and bortezomib, and with disease progression on 
last therapy. 
The proposed new indication of pomalidomide is in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone for 
the treatment of adults with MM who have received at least one prior treatment regimen, including 
lenalidomide. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Lenalidomide-based therapy is a major current standard of care in MM, and it is expected that the vast 
majority of patients will receive LEN for the treatment of newly diagnosed and/or early relapsed refractory 
MM. Consequently, the treatment where LEN is no longer an option, including refractory patients, 
represent a clinically relevant population. Currently, although there are no treatments that were 
developed to specifically address this patient population there are some therapy regimens available for 
lenalidomide refractory patients (e.g. daratumumab or carfilzomib based regimens). 
The combination of lenalidomide and dexamethasone is approved as second line treatment in the EU. 
There are several regimens approved in EU as second line treatment in RRMM that include the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/674052/2018  
Page 81/86 
 
 
 
combination of  LEN + Dex + a third agent (daratumumab, elotuzumab, carfilzomib, ixazomib). 
Bortezomib (monotherapy or in combination with dexamethasone or doxorubicin) is also authorised as 
second line therapy. However, none of these regimens are specifically indicated in lenalidomide refractory 
patients. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical package of Imnovid  for the proposed indication was primarily supported by data from a single 
phase 3 randomized clinical study MM-007 that compared the efficacy and safety of the triplet 
pomalidomide +bortezomib + dexamethasone to the doublet of bortezomib + dexamethasone in patients 
who had received at least 1 prior regimen that included lenalidomide. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
•  Statistically significant improvement in PFS with the POM combination with a reduction of the risk 
of progression or death by 39% in ITT population compared to BTZ+DEX (median 11.2 months 
versus 7.10 months, HR 0.61 (0.49 to 0.77), p< 0.0001) supported by positive results in 
sensitivity analysis. 
• 
The PFS favourable effect with POM combination is maintained in key subgroups of high 
prognostic risk (> 65 years, refractory to LEN, refractory to last prior antimyeloma therapy, 
unfavourable cytogenetics).  
•  Statistically significant improvement in overall response rate (sCR+CR+VGPR+PR) with the POM 
combination (ORR 82.2% versus 50.0 %, OR 5.02 (3.35 to 7.52), p<0.001). Consistent results in 
all subgroups analysis. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
For subjects with at least PR the duration of response was longer for POM combination (median 
13.7 months versus 10.94 months, HR 0.76 (0.56 to 1.02) and the time to response was shorter 
for POM combination (median 0.9 months versus 1.4 months; p<0.001). 
Time to progression was longer for POM combination (median 13.14 months versus 7.79 months, 
HR 0.57 (0.45 to 0.72)). 
Time to treatment failure was longer for POM combination (median 8.54 months versus 4.67 
months, HR 0.54 (0.44 to 0.65)). 
Treatment with POM combination prolongs the time to next anti-myeloma therapy by 58% 
(median 22.24 months versus 8.51 months; HR 0.42 (0.33 to 0.54)). 
PFS after next line therapy (PFS2) showed an advantage for POM combination (median 22.44 
months versus 16.95 months, HR 0.76 (0.59 to 0.99)). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The interim of OS analysis (176 events) did not cross the pre-specified boundary for superiority of the 
POM combination (HR 0.98; 95% CI: 0.73 to 1.32). An updated analysis based on data cut off 15 
September 2018 showed a positive trend in favour of PVd with median OS 40.5 months for the PVd arm 
and 30.5 months for the Vd arm (HR 0.91; 95% CI: 0.70 to 1.18). Overall survival data are still immature 
and the MAH will provide the final OS analysis (expected after 379 events) in Q3 of 2021 (see Annex II).

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most frequently reported (at least 10% of the subjects) pomalidomide-related TEAEs included 
neutropenia (37.8%), thrombocytopenia (28.1%), fatigue (21.9%), constipation (18.0%), diarrhea 
(14.4%), and anemia and peripheral sensory neuropathy (13.3% each).  
The following Grade 3 or 4 ADRs were reported more frequently in the POM + BTZ + LD-DEX arm than in 
the BTZ + LD-DEX arm: peripheral sensory neuropathy (8.3% vs 4.4%), neutropenia (41.7% vs 8.5%), 
fatigue (8.3% vs 3.7%), constipation(2.5% vs 0.4%), diarrhoea (7.2% vs 3.3%) and peripheral oedema 
(1.8%  vs 0.7%). 
The most frequent serious ADR reported was pneumonia. Other reported adverse reactions were in line 
with the safety profile of each drug (e.g. venous thromboembolism, cataract, secondary primary 
malignancies).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The addition of POM to BTZ + DEX results in an improvement in PFS, including patients refractory to LEN. 
As LEN based regimens are used earlier in the treatment of MM and many patients become refractory to 
LEN the proposed POM combination is an option of interest in this patient population. The positive PFS 
results are supported by sensitivity and exploratory analysis and other secondary endpoints.  
The unfavourable effects of the POM combination are in line with the known safety profile of each drug. 
The higher frequency of reported AEs should be viewed in the context of larger treatment duration 
compared to BTZ+ DEX. The toxicity is well managed with supportive care and dose interruptions and to 
a lower extent dose reductions. No new safety concerns have been reported.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit-risk balance of pomalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone for the 
treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior treatment 
regimen including lenalidomide is considered positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Imnovid is positive.

C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I, II, IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
and A 
approved one  
Extension of indication for Imnovid to include a new indication: treatment in combination with bortezomib 
and dexamethasone of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior 
treatment regimen including lenalidomide; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 
of the SmPC are updated. The Annex II is also updated to include a new post-authorisation efficacy study 
(PAES) as an obligation of the marketing authorisation. As a further consequence, new 14-capsule pack 
sizes for the 1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg and 4 mg Imnovid strengths were included to support the new proposed 
posology and pomalidomide dose modification. The SmPC, Labelling and Package leaflet are updated in 
accordance. Finally, section 5.1 of the SmPC is updated in order to update the information on 
pomalidomide mechanism of action based on literature data. The RMP version 15.1 has also been 
updated. 
The group of variations leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, 
Labelling, Package Leaflet and Annex A and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
This CHMP recommendation is subject to the following new condition:

Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures 
The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures: 
Description 
Due date 
• Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES) MM-007: In order to further
30 September 2021 
investigate the efficacy of pomalidomide in combination with bortezomib
and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with multiple
myeloma who have received at least one prior treatment regimen
including lenalidomide, the MAH should submit the final analysis of OS
from the phase 3, randomized, open label study MM-007.
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP is of the opinion that Imnovid is not similar to Farydak, Kyprolis, Darzalex and Ninlaro 
within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. 
Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers, by consensus, that the new therapeutic 
indication brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 
5. EPAR changes
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this group of variations. In particular the 
EPAR module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Extension of indication for Imnovid to include a new indication: treatment in combination with bortezomib 
and dexamethasone of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior 
treatment regimen including lenalidomide; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 
of the SmPC are updated. The Annex II is also updated to include a new post-authorisation efficacy study 
(PAES) as an obligation of the marketing authorisation. As a further consequence, new 14-capsule pack 
sizes for the 1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg and 4 mg Imnovid strengths were included to support the new proposed 
posology and pomalidomide dose modification. The SmPC, Labelling and Package leaflet are updated in 
accordance. Finally, section 5.1 of the SmPC is updated in order to update the information on 
pomalidomide mechanism of action based on literature data. The RMP version 15.1 has also been 
updated.

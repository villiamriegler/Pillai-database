2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Deltyba has a conditional marketing authorisation, obtained on 28 April 2014, for use as part of an 
appropriate combination regimen for pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in adult 
patients when an effective treatment regimen cannot otherwise be composed for reasons of resistance or 
tolerability. The recommended dose in adults is 100 mg twice daily (BID) for 24 weeks. Delamanid is a 
film-coated tablet for oral use. Deltyba has mycobacteria-specific antibacterial activity. 
The PIP for delamanid in paediatric MDR-TB patients aims to determine whether delamanid plasma 
exposure in children of all ages with MDR-TB is similar to the efficacious plasma exposure in adults; 
thereby determining the appropriate paediatric dose (using both the adult and paediatric formulations) 
and documenting safety and tolerability. The PIP for Deltyba (PIP P/0271/2019, EMEA-001113-PIP01-10-
M02) essentially consists of 3 clinical trials in addition to the paediatric formulation development and 
juvenile toxicity assessment: a pharmacokinetic (PK) trial (Trial 242-12-232) in children of all ages with 
MDR-TB on therapy with optimised background regimen (OBR), followed by a 24-month safety and 
tolerability extension trial (Trial 242-12-233) in the same patient population, and a 
bioavailability/bioequivalence trial (Trial 242-12-245) in adults to investigate the comparative 
bioavailability of the paediatric formulation (5- and 25-mg immediate-dissolving tablets) with the 
delamanid 50-mg tablet adult formulation. At the cut-off date of 13 Dec 2016, all children from the first 
two age groups (ages 6 - 17 years) have completed the 24-month safety and tolerability long-term Trial 
242-12-233 including the 6-month delamanid treatment in conjunction with an OBR, the overall 6 month 
post-treatment and follow-up periods, and the additional 12-month treatment outcome follow-up period. 
The trial is still ongoing in younger children (age groups 0 - 2 and 3 - 5 years) and trial finalisation will be 
in March 2020 in agreement with the PIP. The aim of this Type II variation is to already extend the 
delamanid MDR-TB indication to children 6 to 17 years of age. 
Childhood TB disease is different from adult TB disease. These differences include time from exposure to 
disease onset, epidemiologic differences in contagiousness, pathophysiology, bacillary load, and clinical 
and radiographic manifestations. Most cases of childhood TB have a short period between exposure to a 
contagious individual and manifestation of symptoms. Differences in the pathophysiology and clinical 
presentation of TB in children make diagnosis more challenging in children than in adults and definitions 
of latent infection and active disease are not as clear. Children are also at a much higher risk of 
progression to active disease than adults. This risk is greatest for infants and children under 2 years of 
age. 
Infants have a particularly high rate of morbidity and mortality from TB. Children under the age of 5 
years are frequently affected by peripheral lymphadenopathy and 65% to 75% of these children have a 
thoracic and mediastinal location. In a setting with a high incidence of TB and ongoing transmission, the 
most common clinical presentation of TB in young children, i.e., age ≤ 5 years, is likely to be pulmonary 
TB. 
Older children and adolescents (> 10 years) often present with adult-type cavitary disease with a high 
bacillary load. Pleural TB typically has been considered a disease of adulthood and is estimated to 
comprise approximately 4% of disease cases. However, TB pleural effusions can complicate 12% to 38% 
of cases in children with untreated pulmonary TB. Pleural involvement is more common among 
adolescents, and the mean age at diagnosis is 13 years. Adult-type disease is a phenomenon that 
suddenly appears around puberty and is distinguished by cavitation that occurs predominantly in the lung 
apices.

EMA/526836/2020 
Page 6/68 
 
 
  
  
Overall, the lifetime risk of progression from infection to active disease is 5% to 20% for 
immunocompetent older children and 40% to 50% for children in the first 2 years of life. Adolescents 
have a slightly higher risk of disease progression than adults. 
The diagnosis of childhood TB is challenging. Microbiological confirmation is often not available due to the 
paucibacillary nature of disease and the difficulty of specimen collection (especially sputum) in younger 
children. The diagnosis usually relies on nonspecific clinical and radiologic signs, as well as a history of 
exposure (i.e., close contact with a TB case). Fever (possibly intermittent or low grade), weight loss or 
failure to thrive, and persistent cough for > 2 weeks are the most important clinical signs for pulmonary 
TB. 
Children are diagnosed with either confirmed or presumed MDR-TB. Confirmed disease occurs when an 
organism is isolated from the child and is shown either genotypically or phenotypically to be resistant to 
isoniazid and rifampicin. Presumed disease occurs when TB is diagnosed in combination with either known 
contact with an MDR-TB case or after failure of appropriate first-line therapy when adherence has been 
verified. Incident cases of childhood TB reflect recent transmission, which implies that drug resistance 
patterns observed among paediatric TB cases reflect primary (transmitted) drug resistance within the 
community. If a child presenting with TB is a known contact of an adult with MDR pulmonary TB, the child 
is a probable MDR-TB case and should be managed accordingly. 
Treatment of drug-resistant TB is long, expensive and associated with frequent adverse events. In 
children, treatment is further complicated by limited data on appropriate dosing and safety, and a lack of 
child-friendly formulations. New anti-TB drugs are urgently needed to improve treatment tolerability and 
outcome, particularly for MDR-TB cases with additional second-line drug resistance, for whom identifying 
at least four active drugs is difficult with the current armamentarium of drugs. 
The principles for treating adults with MDR-TB have demonstrated over time that they generally apply to 
infants, children, and adolescents, and the regimens recommended by the WHO for childhood-type TB 
continue to be essentially the same as for adult-type TB. 
Children with MDR-TB are managed in much the same way as adults, although there are some 
differences. Confirmation of MDR-TB may not be possible in children and child TB cases in recent close 
contact with an adult MDR-TB case or failing to respond to adherent first-line treatment should be 
empirically treated as MDR-TB cases. Because of the paucibacillary nature of early primary disease 
(contained primary lung lesion or uncomplicated hilar/mediastinal lymph node enlargement), these 
children may need fewer drugs and shorter durations of treatment, although there are no randomised 
studies to confirm this. 
The EMA Addendum to the guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products indicated for treatment of 
bacterial infections to address the clinical development of new agents to treat pulmonary disease due to 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (EMA/CHMP/EWP/14377/2008 Rev. 1, 20 July 2017) gives the following 
recommendations on the paediatric population: 
- The presentation and treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis is similar in adults and paediatric patients 
aged from approximately 10 years so that an extrapolation of safety and efficacy data obtained from 
adults is acceptable. Sponsors may also consider including adolescent patients with tuberculosis in trials 
conducted in adults. 
- The presentation of clinical disease may be different in children aged less than approximately 10 years 
compared to adults but the response to treatment may be comparable at least from the age of five years 
upwards, supporting the possibility of extrapolating efficacy documented in adults (and possibly also 
adolescents if they are enrolled into the same trials as adults) to this age group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/526836/2020 
Page 7/68 
 
 
  
  
- There are recognised difficulties in diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis in children aged less than 5 years 
in whom extrapulmonary disease occurs more often and the clinical presentation and radiological findings 
may differ from those in older children and adults. Nevertheless, an extrapolation of efficacy data in 
adults to paediatric age groups is considered to be possible provided that appropriate age-specific dose 
regimens can be established using pharmacokinetic data obtained in children with tuberculosis and the 
safety profile is shown to be acceptable. The diagnosis of tuberculosis in these children should be based 
on age-specific criteria recommended by internationally-recognised expert bodies. 
- Sponsors may also consider establishing post-authorisation registries for collecting data on treatment 
outcomes from paediatric patients. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Suitability of the existing dosage form for the proposed age group 
The MAH provided data to justify the acceptability of the existing dosage form for the proposed age 
group. In trial 242-12-233, the dose which applied to children 12 to 17 years of age was the adult dose of 
100 mg delamanid BID and the dose which applied to children 11 to 6 years of age was 50 mg delamanid 
BID. Both age groups received the already approved tablet formulation (50 mg film-coated tablet) in the 
paediatric trials while younger children received delamanid dispersible tablets (in the paediatric 
investigation plan [PIP] named “delamanid paediatric formulation” [DPF]). In agreement with the PIP, 
assessment of the acceptability/palatability has been performed only for the DPF and not for the 
approved tablet formulation and therefore such information for the approved tablet formulation could not 
be presented in the dossier. As the trial was still ongoing in younger age groups receiving DPF, final 
assessment of acceptability/palatability of DPF has not been available or applicable for this indication 
extension. 
Regarding the suitability of Deltyba 50 mg film-coated tablets for children aged 6 to 17 years, the MAH 
stated that according to the “Guideline on Pharmaceutical Development of medicines for paediatric use” 
(hereafter named “Guideline”) and the Reflection Paper “Formulations of Choice for the Paediatric 
Population” (hereafter named “Reflection Paper”), tablets can be considered appropriate pharmaceutical 
forms for children aged 6 years and older. In particular, Table 3.1 of the “Reflection Paper” shows that 
tablets are coded as “preferred acceptability” (age 6 to 11 years) and “dosage form of choice” (age 12 to 
below 18 years). Furthermore, the EU guidance documents state that training can improve the 
acceptability of tablets and that with appropriate training, even children younger than 6 years may be 
able to swallow tablets (see “Guideline” Section 6.2.1 and “Reflection Paper” Section 2.1.7). This should 
apply particularly to indications requiring long term treatment, such as MDR-TB. Although the tablets are 
relatively large (11.7 mm in diameter), they were tolerated in the clinical trials. The excipients of the 
delamanid 50 mg film-coated tablets should also not raise concerns regarding the use in paediatric 
patients aged 6 years and older. The only excipient with a known effect requiring specific information in 
the SmPC and package leaflet is lactose, see “Annex to the European Commission guideline on 'Excipients 
in the labelling and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use'”. Lactose is a well-established 
excipient, and according to the Annex to the Excipients Guideline referenced above, this information is 
already included in the approved Deltyba SmPC and package leaflet and the information provided is also 
considered acceptable for children aged 6 years and older. Finally, it has to be taken into consideration 
that the therapeutic indication limits the use of the approved film-coated tablets to paediatric patients 
with a body weight of at least 30 kg who are expected to be significantly older than 6 years. 
The CHMP noted that the included patients were 7 to 17 years of age. No difficulties were reported 
regarding tablet acceptability. Tablet acceptability issues were never reported as a reason for study 
Assessment report  
EMA/526836/2020 
Page 8/68 
 
 
  
  
discontinuation. Monitoring the acceptability of the 50 mg film-coated tablets was not an endpoint of this 
study and is likely an underestimation of potential problems. No further data can be obtained from trial 
242-12-233 in the patients aged 6 to 17 years of age as this study part has been completed. 
The CHMP noted that according to the EMA reflection paper on the formulations of choice for the 
paediatric population, tablets are an acceptable formulation for children (6-11 y) and adolescents (12-18 
years of age). No unacceptability of the tablets, e.g. due to the size, has been reported in the clinical 
study, though this was not a predefined study outcome. 
Although not explicitly assessed, no negative reports from study sites, children or parents, respectively, 
on the excipients, tablet size, swallowability, acceptability, palatability or administration instructions 
became available nor was there a drop-out case reported because of unacceptability. All patients 6 to 17 
years of age who received the delamanid 50 mg adult tablet tolerated the tablet without reported 
difficulties. 
The MAH stated that the diameter of the film-coated tablet is 11.7 mm and that crushing of the film-
coated tablets is difficult because the tablets are very hard due to the film-coating and would require use 
of appropriate equipment. Splitting should not raise specific safety concerns because the pharmaceutical 
form is for immediate release but another important disadvantage of splitting the tablets is the expected 
sensation of unpleasant taste. The 50 mg film-coated tablets are not scored and very hard, therefore they 
are not considered suitable for splitting. Although there are no specific safety concerns regarding crushing 
or splitting of the film-coated tablets, the MAH does not propose addition of such proposals to SmPC or 
package leaflet. 
The CHMP considered that the tablet size is acceptable and agreed that the 50 mg film-coated tablets are 
not scored and very hard. An unpleasant taste is expected when the tablets will be crushed. Therefore, 
the tablets are not considered suitable for splitting and it is considered appropriate that no information on 
splitting or crushing the tablets is added to the SmPC or PL. 
With regard to the potential administration of delamanid through feeding tubes, the MAH referred to the 
“Guideline”, Section 6.2.3 which states that administration through feeding tubes needs to be addressed 
if this either a main route or a very likely option. MDR-TB as such is not a disease which requires 
administration of food or medicinal products through feeding tubes. Use of feeding tubes in MDR-TB 
would be more the result of concomitant diseases (e.g., acute diseases requiring intensive care) or very 
poor general health conditions (e.g., elderly patients, preterm neonates). For patients with such poor 
general health conditions or concomitant acute diseases, it is more likely that treatment of MDR-TB will 
be discontinued until the general health conditions of the patients have been improved. 
The MAH therefore concluded that MDR-TB is a disease where potential administration of delamanid 
through feeding tubes is very unlikely.  
The CHMP was of the view that administration of MDR-TB treatment through feeding tubes is not very 
likely. Possibly, the delamanid paediatric formulation, a dispersible tablet, might be a better solution for 
administration via feeding tubes. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the quality aspects 
The acceptability of the existing dosage form for the proposed age group has not been investigated in the 
paediatric clinical studies for children of 6 to 17 years of age. It was noted that no difficulties were 
reported regarding tablet acceptability and tablet acceptability issues were never reported as a reason for 
study discontinuation.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted an ERA addendum. No other new non-clinical PK/PD or toxicology data have been 
submitted in this application. However, in the Deltyba Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted 
according to Article 46 of the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 (EMEA/H/C/002552/P46/007, 20/09/2018), 
the following table is included:  
Table 1 Line listing of all the studies included in the development program  
The 10w juvenile rat study report has been submitted to the PDCO for PIP compliance check, but was not 
formally submitted for CHMP assessment. 
From the PDCO report, it seems that the NOAEL in males is the lowest dose tested:  
Study design 
OPC-242 (SD powder) was administered orally by gavage to juvenile Sprague-Dawley rats [Crl:CD(SD), 4 
days of age at the start of administration, 43 or 67 animals of each sex] once daily for 10 weeks at dose 
levels of 0 (5 w/v% gum arabic solution), 0 (control article: 0% OPC-242 (SD powder)), 3, 30 and 300 
mg/kg/day as OPC-242. 
Study results 
Males and females showed prolongation of activated partial thromboplastine time, males showed 
prolongation and females showed a tendency toward prolongation of prothrombine time, and females 
showed a high value in motor activity and a low value in the number of corpora lutea in the 300 mg/kg 
group, and males in the 30 and 300 mg/kg groups showed suppressed body weight gain in association 
with low food consumption from Week 3 of administration, it was judged that the nontoxic dose level was 
3 mg/kg in males and 30 mg/kg in females. 
The MAH provided an addendum to the non-clinical overview and the study report with the results of the 
10-week juvenile rat study. The addendum non-clinical overview concludes that “the toxicity observed in 
juvenile animals was similar to those seen in the adult animal, i.e., the juvenile animal does not appear to 
be uniquely sensitive to the toxicity of delamanid” Based on this conclusion, the MAH proposed to add the 
following statement to the SmPC Section 5.3: “In juvenile toxicity studies in rats, all delamanid 
treatment-related findings were consistent with those noted in adult animals”. This is agreed by the CHMP 
Dose-range finding (DRF) study: 
Design: SD rats PND 4, 4 weeks dosing, oral, once daily, 0, 10, 30, 100, 300 mg/kg 
Assessment report  
EMA/526836/2020 
Page 10/68 
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
Plasma concentrations were determined in a subset of animals at Day 35 of administration. There were 
no treatment-related deaths during the conduct of the study. There were also no treatment-related 
effects on body weight, food consumption, haematology, or gross necropsy. 
Results: 1 animal died in the HD group, cause of death unknown. Otherwise, there were no test article-
related changes in any examination in either sex. 
Definitive JAS study: 
Design: SD Rats PND 4 oral 10 week + 4 week recovery, dose levels were 0, 3, 30, 300 mg/kg/day 
Main cohort (evaluated for behaviour, and pathology; necropsy at Weeks 2, 5, or 10), Recovery cohort 
(sensory and motor function, motor activity, learning performance, ophthalmology, urinalysis, and 
pathology), Mating cohort (evaluated for behaviour, learning performance, sexual maturation, fertility and 
reproductive function) and Toxicokinetic (TK) cohort (blood collection at Weeks 2, 5 or 10). In the Mating 
cohort, male and female animals were cohabitated for a maximum of 2 weeks starting in Week 6 of the 
recovery period.  
Both the DRF and definitive JAS studies were conducted in compliance with GLP. 
Results: One male in the placebo control group and 1 male and 2 females in the 300 mg/kg group died 
during the lactation period between Day 5 and Day 17 of administration (1 female due to worsened 
general condition, 2 others cause of death unknown). No effects on general condition, detailed clinical 
observation, manipulative test, grip strength, learning performance (Water-filled Multiple T-maze Test), 
observation of external differentiation, ophthalmological examination, urinalysis, blood chemistry 
examination, organ weight, necropsy or histopathological examination. 
Summary of main findings in the high dose group of 300 mg/kg:  
- body weights of male animals were lower than those of the vehicle control group at various periods 
during the dosing phase and remained lower throughout the recovery period. Males in the 30 and 300 
mg/kg groups in the mating cohorts also showed suppressed body weight gain. 
- Motor activity was increased in females at week 10 of dosing and week 4 of recovery.  
- prolonged PT and aPTT in males and females at Week 2 and/or Week 10, which resolved by Week 4 of 
recovery.  
- low values in urine volume, sodium, potassium, chloride and creatinine in males.  
- lower number of corpora lutea, implantations, and live embryos.  
The NOAELs were considered to be 3 mg/kg/day in juvenile male rats (AUC0-24h: 18760 ng.h/mL) and 30 
mg/kg/day in juvenile female rats (AUC0-24h: 49060 ng.h/mL). 
The CHMP considered that regarding the toxicokinetics, it appears from the data obtained in the DRF 
study that in the 100 and 300 mg/kg groups, Cmax and AUC values were similar to or lower than 30 
mg/kg. From the table below, and the TK data from the definitive JAS study, it seems that especially in 
the low dose groups, the exposure was abnormally high. This has not been explained but is not 
considered as a concern given that the exposures in the definitive study generally increased in a dose-

Table 2 Toxicokinetic parameters of OPC-242 in week 5 of administration in juvenile rats 
- In the definitive JAS study, there was unexpected contamination in the vehicle and placebo control 
group at week 2 (plasma concentrations from 294.7 ng/mL to 707.4 ng/mL in the vehicle control group, 
and from 127.6 ng/mL to 1380 ng/mL in the placebo control). In weeks 5 and 10, all values were below 
the LLOQ. 
- In Week 2, the Cmax and AUC24h of OPC-242 were increased in a dose-related manner for both sexes. In 
Weeks 5 and 10, the AUC24h of OPC-242 was increased in a dose-related manner for both sexes; 
however, the Cmax of OPC-242 in the 300 mg/kg group was similar to that of the 30 mg/kg group for both 
sexes. 
- There were no sex differences in TK. 
- Age-related differences in TK have not been discussed. From the table above, it is noted that there were 
no significant TK differences between week 5 and 10, which is not unexpected in view of the age of 
animals, i.e. between PND 32/39 and PND 67/74, respectively. There were some age-related increases in 
exposure in week 2 (animals PND 11-18) when comparing to week 10 (adult age), which may have been 
linked to immature metabolism in the youngest group, however, the differences were limited to a ~2-fold 
increase in AUC.  
The CHMP considered that regarding the main findings in the high dose group of 300 mg/kg:  
- Motor activity was increased in females at week 10 of dosing and week 4 of recovery. Since the motor 
activity was slightly higher than the historical background data, the relation to administration of the test 
article could not be ruled out. However, this change is estimated to be of little toxicological significance 
since there were no changes suggestive of increased motility/reactivity relating to the high value in motor 
activity in clinical observation and detailed clinical observation, although the mechanism for the 
occurrence of this change remains unclear. 
- prolonged PT and aPTT in males and females at Week 2 and/or Week 10, which resolved by Week 4 of 
recovery. Similar findings have been reported in previous repeated dose toxicity studies with delamanid. 
- low values in urine volume, sodium, potassium, chloride and creatinine in males. According to the study 
report, these changes were reversible and judged to be within the range of physiological variations. 
- lower number of corpora lutea, implantations, and live embryos. No effects on any of these parameters 
were observed in previous rat studies including FEED study in rats and rat EFD study. In rabbit EFD, an

increase in pre-implantation loss and early resorptions as observed but was considered secondary to 
maternal toxicity.

Figure 1 Ten-week Repeated Oral Dose Toxicity Study of OPC-242 (SD powder) in Juvenile 
Rates with 4-week Recovery Test 
The MAH was requested to discuss the clinical relevance (incl. safety margins) of the observed effects on 
corpora lutea, implantation and live embryos in the high dose females especially as such effects have not 
been reported in any of the previous adult rats studies including the FEED and EFD studies in rats 
administered the same dose. Similar effects were observed in the rabbit EFD study, albeit in the presence 
of maternal toxicity. However, the effects observed in the juvenile rat study are reported in the absence 
of any effects on body weight in the female animals.  
The MAH provided data showing that although the mean number of corpora lutea was significantly 
reduced at 300 mg/kg/day, the mean number corpora lutea at the 300 mg/kg/day dose group (mean = 
10.7) falls within the historical control range for this species of rats (mean of 9 to 18.3). In addition, 
delamanid had no effect on number of estruses, mean oestrous cycle, number of days until copulation, or 
fertility index. Furthermore, histopathological examination of the main cohort animals showed no 
abnormal findings in the ovary. Based on the totality of data, the CHMP agreed that the reduced number 
of corpora lutea in the 300 mg/kg/day is likely an incidental finding and does not reflect a toxic effect of 
delamanid. The CHMP was therefore of the view that the effects on corpora lutea are not considered to be 
related to delamanid. 
As the product is to be approved for a paediatric population, the CHMP considered it appropriate to 
include the following paragraph in section 4.8 of the SmPC, following the tabulated list of adverse drug 
reactions, to describe the safety profile seen in this population: 
“Paediatric population  
Based on a study (see section 5.1) in 13 children and adolescents aged 6 – 17 years, the frequency, type 
and severity of adverse reactions in children are expected to be the same as in adults. 
Clinical study safety data are not available for children under 6 years.”

See discussion above on the juvenile animal data. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH submitted an ERA addendum stating that since the initial PEC calculations were not limited to 
adult patients, a new ERA is not needed for an extension to paediatric patients.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The approval of the paediatric indication for Deltyba may increase the environmental exposure to 
delamanid. However, in the initial ERA, the PEC calculations were not limited to adult patients. The 
calculation of a refined PEC was based on published epidemiological data (WHO report from 2009) for all 
tuberculosis patients in the EU (data from 2007). Although the epidemiological data seem outdated, the 
provided justification for not providing a new ERA is considered acceptable. It can be concluded that no 
new environmental risk assessment is required. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Based on the updated data submitted in this application, the new/extended indication may lead to an 
increase in environmental exposure further to the use of delamanid. Nevertheless, considering the above 
data, delamanid is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Three clinical trials were performed in accordance with the PIP for Deltyba: 
- 
- 
- 
Trial 242-12-232: a pharmacokinetic (PK) trial in children of all ages with MDR-TB on therapy 
with optimised background regimen (OBR) 
Trial 242-12-233: a 24-month safety and tolerability extension trial of trial 242-12-232 in the 
same patient population 
Trial 242-12-245: a bioavailability/bioequivalence trial in adults to investigate the comparative 
bioavailability of the paediatric formulation (5- and 25-mg immediate-dissolving tablets) with the 
delamanid 50-mg tablet adult formulation 
In view of the scope of this Type II variation, which concerns the extension of the MDR-TB indication to 
children 6-17 years of age, the first two trials are of interest as the third trial concerns the bioequivalence 
between the actual delamanid tablets formulation and the paediatric formulation, which has only been 
used in children 0-5 years of age. It is important to note that the 50 mg tablet formulation used in the 
paediatric population is the same formulation and strength as used in adults. Only children from the first 
two age groups (ages 6 - 17 years) have completed the 24-month safety and tolerability trial long-term 
Trial 242-12-233 including the 6-month delamanid treatment in conjunction with an OBR, the overall 6 
month post-treatment and follow-up periods, and the additional 12-month treatment outcome follow-up 
period. The trial is still ongoing in younger children (age groups 0 - 2 and 3 - 5 years) and trial 
finalisation will be in March 2020.  
Trial 242-12-232 (Trial 232) was designed to define the paediatric dose in subjects between 0 to 17 years 
of age that will result in a delamanid systemic exposure equivalent to that observed in the pivotal adult 
trials. Further objectives of that trial were the safety and tolerability of delamanid in combination with 
OBR treatment and the palatability of delamanid paediatric formulation (DPF). Results of this trial were 
already introduced and assessed as part of the Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006 in July 2018 
(EMA/H/C/002552/P46/007). Below a summary of the PK results and the conclusions of this trial can be 
found. Trial 242-12-233 (Trial 233) is a 6-month treatment extension trial evaluating the long-term 
safety and tolerability of the age-specific delamanid doses used in Trial 232 and to characterise the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of delamanid in this population. Delamanid PK data from this trial were combined 
with PK data from the Trial 232 and analysed using population PK methods. 
Trial  242-12-232:  Phase  1,  Open-label,  Multiple-dose,  Age  De-escalation  Trial  to 
Assess  the  Pharmacokinetics,  Safety,  and  Tolerability  of  Delamanid  (OPC-67683)  in 
Paediatric  Multidrug-resistant  Tuberculosis  Patients  on  Therapy  with  an  Optimised 
Background regimen.  
Trial 242-12-232 was a phase 1, multicentre, open-label, uncontrolled, multiple-dose, age de-escalation 
trial to assess the safety and tolerability of delamanid in paediatric subjects with MDR-TB who were also 
receiving OBR. The goal of this trial was to define the paediatric dose for delamanid in children from birth 
(0) to 17 years of age that results in delamanid plasma exposure similar to the plasma exposure in adult 
patients  that  has  been  demonstrated  to  be  safe  and  effective  for  the  treatment  of  Multidrug-resistant 
Tuberculosis (MDR-TB).

Objectives 
• 
• 
• 
To determine the PK of delamanid and its metabolites in combination with OBR in paediatric MDR-
TB subjects. 
To determine the safety and tolerability of delamanid in combination with OBR in paediatric MDR-
TB subjects. 
To determine the palatability of the delamanid paediatric formulation. 
Study design 
The  trial  was  conducted  sequentially  in  4  groups  of  paediatric  subjects:  Group  1  (ages  12  –  17  years, 
inclusive, n = 6 ), Group 2 (ages 6 - 11 years, inclusive, n = 6), Group 3 (ages 3 – 5 years, inclusive, n = 
12), Group 4 (ages birth - 2 years, inclusive, n = 12). 
Subjects who dropped out or who completed this trial (Trial 242-12-232) and decided not to participate in 
the 6-month extension trial (Trial 242-12-233) were replaced. 
Delamanid was administered to study subjects for 10 days with 8 days of safety follow-up and PK sampling 
was performed on Days 1, 2, 10, 11, 13 (Groups 1 and 2 only), 15, and 18. 
Study population /Sample size 
A total of 44 subjects were screened for this trial. The trial enrolled 37 males and females ages birth to 17 
years, inclusive, who were receiving OBR for confirmed or presumptive MDR-TB. 
All enrolled subjects who completed Trial 242-12-232 were rolled over to Trial 242-12-233, an open-label, 
uncontrolled, 6-month extension trial to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and PK of delamanid 
administered BID for Groups 1, 2, and 3; and once or twice daily, depending upon body weight for Group 
4, for 6 months in paediatric subjects with MDR-TB. Trial 242-12-233 was initiated as required under the 
approved Paediatric Investigation Plan. 
Treatments 
Group 1 (ages 12 - 17 years, inclusive) received adult formulation delamanid 100 mg dosing twice per day 
(BID) + OBR (n = 7) 
Group 2 (ages 6 - 11 years, inclusive) received adult formulation delamanid 50 mg BID + OBR (n = 6) 
Group 3 (ages 3 - 5 years, inclusive) received delamanid paediatric formulation (DPF) 25 mg BID + OBR 
(n = 12) 
Group  4  (ages  birth  -  2  years,  inclusive)  received  the  following  DPF  dose  based  on  body  weight  during 
baseline visit (n = 12): 
•  Subjects > 10 kg received DPF 10 mg BID + OBR 
•  Subjects > 8 and ≤ 10 kg received DPF 5 mg BID + OBR 
•  Subjects ≥ 5.5 kg and ≤ 8 kg received DPF 5 mg QD + OBR 
The morning dose of the delamanid BID regimen was given within 30 minutes after the start of a standard 
breakfast  meal.  The  evening  dose  of  the  BID  dose  regimen  was  given  10  hours  post  morning  dose  and 
within  30  minutes  after  the  start  of  a  standard  dinner  meal.  For  the  QD  regimen,  delamanid  was

administered within 30 minutes after the start of a standard breakfast meal. Food composition was typical 
for the children’s age and needs. 
The second-line medications were those generally used in developing OBR for MDR-TB subject treatment. 
PK Outcomes/endpoints 
For each subject, the following PK parameters were determined for delamanid and delamanid metabolite 
(DM-6705): 
•  Cmax, tmax, AUC0-24h on Day 1 and Day 10 
• 
t½ z on Day 10 
•  Rac Day 10/Day 1 for AUC0-24h, and apparent total clearance (CLss/F) for delamanid only 
Statistical Methods 
Determination of Sample Size: 
This was a phase 1, open-label trial to assess the PK parameters, safety and tolerability of delamanid. No 
formal  statistical  hypothesis  testing  was  planned.  Thus,  no  formal  sample  size  calculation  based  on 
statistical power was required. All statistical presentations are descriptive. 
The following delamanid PK parameters were determined using noncompartmental analysis: 
• 
Peak (maximal) concentration of drug in plasma (Cmax), time of peak concentration of drug (tmax), 
area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24h) on Day 1 and 
Day 10 
•  Accumulation ratio Day 10/Day 1 for AUC0-24h 
•  Apparent terminal phase elimination half-life (t1/2z) and apparent total clearance 
PK analysis of delamanid metabolite (DM-6705) plasma concentrations was performed where feasible. 
• 
The following PK parameters were determined for DM-6705 using noncompartmental analysis: Cmax, 
tmax, AUC0-24h on Day 1 and Day 10 and t1/2z. 
Plasma  concentrations  and  PK  parameters  when determined,  were  reported with  descriptive  statistics  in 
the PK report. No prior inferential statistical comparisons were performed. 
Bioanalytical Results 
A  total  of  582  plasma  samples  were  received  by  the  bioanalytical  laboratory.  Concentration  results  for 
delamanid and DM-6705 were generated for 556 samples; the remaining 26 samples were backups and 
were not analysed.

BID (Group 1), 50 mg BID (Group 2), 25 mg BID (Group 3) or 5-20 mg (Group 4) of Delamanid 
to Pediatric MDR-Subjects 
In Groups 1 to 4, the median delamanid Cmax on Day 10 was 557, 573, 500, and 179 ng/mL, respectively; 
the median AUC0-24h on Day 10 was 9790, 12000, 9290, and 2740 ng*h/mL, respectively. The Cmax and the 
AUC0-24h ranges were reasonably similar for Groups 1 to 3 but were much lower for Group 4. 
The MAH notes that the ratio of AUC0-24h on Day 10 of DM-6705 to delamanid appears to decrease with 
decreasing age, indicating that either the formation of DM-6705 is decreasing or its elimination is increasing 
or  a  combination  of  the  two  scenarios.  The  median  terminal  elimination  half-life  of  DM-6705  was  237.3 
hours in Group 1 and 128.2 hours for Group 4, indicating a more rapid elimination with decreasing age. 
In order to compare the exposures across the groups, the weight normalised oral clearance, was calculated 
for each regimen. The median weight-normalised oral clearance on Day 10 for delamanid was 8.92, 6.11, 
6.68, and 8.34 for Groups 1 to 4, respectively. 
The results indicated that the clearances for all groups, including most subjects in Group 4, were within a 
narrow range and the lower exposures observed in Group 4 were due to this group receiving lower doses 
of delamanid. 
The CHMP noted that no subjects had missing PK data. Delamanid exposures in children aged 2 years to 
<18 years in Groups 1 to 3, were comparable to each other but higher than in adults. When considering all 
age groups, delamanid exposures were the lowest for the youngest children aged from birth to less than 2 
years (Group 4).  
The dosing regimen for Group 4 was determined by modelling PK data from the previous three groups and 
it  was  thus  expected  that  the  delamanid  doses  used  would  have  a  higher  predicted  bioavailability  for 
children in this age cohort. However, the current data suggest that a higher delamanid dose is needed in 
the youngest children. As this Type II variation applies to extend the indication to children 6-17, this will 
not be further discussed in this AR, but the MAH is reminded of the conclusions of the outcome of their 
Article 46 application, that further paediatric development is needed for these young children as, at this 
stage, the available data do not fully determine the benefit-risk of delamanid in this youngest population. 
Trial  242-12-233:  Phase  2,  Open-label,  Multiple-dose  Trial  to  Assess  the  Safety, 
Tolerability,  Pharmacokinetics,  and  Efficacy  of  Delamanid  (OPC-67683)  in  Pediatric 
Multidrugresistant  Tuberculosis  Patients  on  Therapy  with  an  Optimized  Background 
Regimen of Antituberculosis Drugs over a 6-Month Treatment Period 
Trial 242-12-233 (Trial 233) is a 6-month treatment extension trial evaluating the long-term safety and 
tolerability of the age-specific delamanid doses used in Trial 232 and to characterise the pharmacokinetics

(PK) of delamanid in this population. The trial will also assess the palatability (Groups 3 and 4 only) of the 
paediatric formulation using an age-appropriate visual hedonic scale and clinical assessment. 
Objectives 
The primary objectives of this trial are: 
• 
• 
To evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of delamanid and its metabolites in combination 
with an OBR during a 6-month treatment period in paediatric subjects with MDR-TB for the age-
specific delamanid doses determined in Trial 232 
To report delamanid and metabolite plasma concentrations at each visit day by age groups and to 
conduct a population PK analysis of delamanid when delamanid is administered in combination 
with an OBR during a 6-month treatment period in paediatric subjects with MDR-TB 
The secondary objectives are: 
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate the PK/PD relationship of delamanid and its metabolite plasma concentrations and 
change in QTc when delamanid is administered in combination with OBR during a 6-month 
treatment period in paediatric subjects with MDR-TB 
To evaluate the efficacy of delamanid when administered in combination with an OBR during a 6-
month treatment period in paediatric subjects with MDR-TB 
To determine the palatability of the DPF (applicable for Groups 3 and 4 only)  
Study design 
Both Trial 232 and Trial 233 are age de-escalation trials in which paediatric subjects are enrolled in 4 age 
groups: adolescents ages 12 to 17 years, inclusive (Group 1); children ages 6 to 11 years, inclusive (Group 
2); children ages 3 to 5 years, inclusive (Group 3); and newborns and infants ages birth to 2 years, inclusive 
(Group 4). 
All  subjects  must  have  completed  the  paediatric  PK  Trial  232  prior  to  enrolment  into  Trial  233.  Those 
subjects who have completed Trial 232 and choose to enter Trial 233 must rollover from Trial 232 within 
30 days of completing that trial. Subjects who terminate Trial 233 early are not replaced. 
Blood  samples  were  taken  for  determination  of  delamanid  and  metabolite  (DM-6705)  plasma 
concentrations. 
An interim analysis was conducted focusing on groups (Groups 1 and 2) treated with the adult formulation. 
As of the cutoff date of 13 Dec 2016, all subjects enrolled into Groups 1 and 2 have completed the 24-
month  MDR-TB  therapy  including the 6-month  delamanid  treatment,  the overall  6-month  posttreatment 
and follow-up periods, and the 12-month treatment outcome follow-up. 
Study population /Sample size 
At least 36 males and females ages birth to 17 years, inclusive, who have successfully completed Trial 232, 
and meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, and are receiving OBR for confirmed 
or presumptive MDR-TB were planned to be enrolled in 4 treatment groups based on age. As of the cutoff 
date,  13  subjects  have  been  enrolled  in  the  trial.  Seven  subjects  were  enrolled  into  Group  1  (12  to  17 
years) and 6 subjects into Group 2 (6 to 11 years). All subjects were treated with the IMP and no subject 
discontinued. Overall, 6 male and 7 female subjects with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 12.7 
(3.4) years and a mean (SD) weight of 32.4 (9.3) kg were enrolled at 3 sites in the Philippines (2 sites) 
and South Africa (1 site).

Treatments 
Eligible subjects are assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups based on age and receive delamanid for 182 
days: 
•  Group 1 (ages 12 to 17 years, inclusive): Adult formulation delamanid 100 mg twice daily (BID) + 
OBR (n = 6 [target enrolment number]) 
•  Group 2 (ages 6 to 11 years, inclusive): Adult formulation delamanid 50 mg BID + OBR (n = 6) 
•  Group 3 (ages 3 to 5 years, inclusive): DPF 25 mg BID + OBR (n = 12) 
•  Group 4 (ages birth to 2 years, inclusive): DPF dose based on body weight during baseline visit (n 
= 12): 
o  Subject > 10 kg will receive DPF 10 mg BID + OBR 
o  Subject > 8 and ≤ 10 kg will receive DPF 5 mg BID + OBR 
o  Subject ≤ 8 kg will receive DPF 5 mg once daily (QD) + OBR 
o  Delamanid dose will be adjusted as needed for Group 4 subjects based on the weight 
measurement at specified study visits (Visits 5, 7, 9, 11 and 12).  
PK Outcomes/endpoints 
For each subject, the following PK parameters were determined for delamanid and delamanid metabolite 
(DM-6705): 
•  Cmax, tmax, AUC0-24h on Day 1 and Day 10 
• 
t½ z on Day 10 
•  Rac Day 10/Day 1 for AUC0-24h, and apparent total clearance (CLss/F) for delamanid only

Peak (maximal) concentration of drug in plasma (Cmax), time of peak concentration of drug (tmax), 
area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24h) on Day 1 and 
Day 10 
•  Accumulation ratio Day 10/Day 1 for AUC0-24h 
•  Apparent terminal phase elimination half-life (t1/2z) and apparent total clearance 
PK analysis of delamanid metabolite (DM-6705) plasma concentrations was performed where feasible. 
• 
The following PK parameters were determined for DM-6705 using noncompartmental analysis: Cmax, 
tmax, AUC0-24h on Day 1 and Day 10 and t1/2z. 
Plasma  concentrations  and  PK  parameters  when determined,  were  reported with  descriptive  statistics  in 
the PK report. No prior inferential statistical comparisons were performed. 
PK Results 
No PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) data are summarised or listed in the synoptic clinical study report (CSR) as 
the analysis is ongoing. Those results will be included either in the final CSR or reported separately.

Population PK analysis 
A population PK model was developed for delamanid in the paediatric population with the data collected in 
Trials 232 and 233 in order to define the dose in the paediatric patients. 
The objectives of the analyses described herein were to: 
-  Develop the population PK model and evaluate the effect of the covariates on the variability of PK 
of delamanid in the paediatric population. 
- 
 Define the paediatric doses for patients between 0-17 years of age that will result in a delamanid 
systemic exposure comparable to that in adults following the approved 
An internal interim population PK model of delamanid was used as the starting point for the base model 
building.  A  2-compartment  model  with  transit  compartment  modelled  absorption  (number  of  transit 
compartments  =  1)  and  linear  elimination  (with  interindividual  variability  on  clearance  [CL]  and  central 
volume of  distribution  [Vc];  inter-occasional  variability  on  bioavailability  [F1] and  mean  absorption  time 
[MAT]) was determined to adequately fit the data. Weight was determined to be significant covariate on 
CL, Vc, inter-compartmental clearance (Q) and peripheral volume of distribution (Vp) in the model. Age 
was a significant covariate on F1 only for age < 2 y. A summary of the covariates that may be evaluated 
and the PK parameters on which each were to be tested was provided. Covariates were selected based on 
known  or  hypothetical  factors  that  could  affect  the PK.  The  relationships  between  covariates  and  model 
parameters were explored graphically using the empirical Bayesian estimates (EBEs) from the final base 
model. Also, to screen for other covariate relationships unanticipated. 
Potential covariates were tested in a stepwise process on key PK parameters. The covariate selection was 
performed using forward addition process followed by a backward deletion approach. In order to be retained 
in the final model, a potential covariate will be required to offer statistically significant improvement in the 
model fit as estimated by the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT). 
A  number  of  standard  diagnostic  plots  was  used  throughout  model  development  to  assess  the  ability  of 
each  model  to  describe  the  observed  data.  These  diagnostic  plots  include  observed  vs.  individual  and 
population predicted concentrations (PRED), weighted residuals/CWRES/ normalised prediction distribution 
errors vs. PRED or time.  
Bootstrap  re-sampling  techniques  was  used  to  evaluate  the  stability  of  the  final  model  and  to  estimate 
confidence intervals for the model parameters. Visual Predictive Checks (VPCs) were used to evaluate the 
predictive ability of the final model. 
Stochastic  simulation  scenarios  potentially  examined  a  range  of  doses  and  regimens  to  support  dose 
selection. The final population PK model was used as a basis for these simulations. Demographic information 
(i.e. age, body weight) was extracted from two studies in paediatric TB patients. Study 1 is observational 
study  in  MDR-TB  paediatric  patients,  while  Study  2  is  hospital-based  study  for  paediatric  patients  who 
started  TB  treatment  (not  MDR).  Both  studies  were  conducted  in  South  Africa.  For  the  source  of  adult 
exposure, data from adult subjects with MDR-TB who received 100 mg BID treatment regimen of delamanid 
(Study 242-07-204) was used. 
The CHMP was of the view that the population PK modelling approach used to inform doses to be used in 
children  of  6  to  17  years  of  age,  assuming  that  similar  PK  exposure  as  in  adults  should  lead  to  similar 
response  to  delamanid,  is  acceptable  in  principle  provided  that  other  factors  that  also  impact  overall 
response to treatment are also comparable in adult and paediatric populations: these include disease stage 
and concomitant medications. 
Childhood  tuberculosis  (TB)  is  heterogeneous  manifesting  as  pleural  effusions,  disseminated  (miliary) 
disease, lymph node disease, central nervous system disease, congenital TB, skeletal disease, and (later in 
childhood) adult-type disease.

Clinical information on efficacy of delamanid in adults is not available other than for pulmonary MDR-TB; 
however, there is little evidence in general on treatment of MDR-TB in children at this time and therefore 
the treatment of MDR-TB and extensively-drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in paediatric patients is 
guided by the same principles and uses the same second-line drugs as the treatment in adult patients. 
Accordingly, programmes for treating children with MDR-TB use the World Health Organisation (WHO) 
guidelines applied for treatment of adult patients. With respect to concomitant medication administered 
specifically to children, the principles for concomitant drug administration specified in the Deltyba SmPC 
are applicable.  
As regards the Pop PK model development and evaluation, the CHMP considered overall that the methods 
used are state of the art, and noted that the MAH provided a discussion on the scientific plausibility of the 
covariates tested on the different model parameters and presented the collinearity/correlation between 
categorical vs continuous covariates. Results show overall good estimation of parameters. Only the 
intercompartmental clearance was estimated with a RSE of>50%. Results of graphical evaluation are also 
overall acceptable.  
Results of simulation results were shown for Cmax and AUCs. However, the only comparison with adult 
results was the AUC ratios for AUCs (presumably) medians and the MAH was therefore requested to 
provide box plots displaying comparisons of distributions of AUC, Cmax and Cmin between adults and 
different range of bodyweight in children should be provided. The MAH was also requested to present, 
compare and discuss the relevance of Cmin and provide distributions of Cmin for comparison between adults 
and paediatric subjects. 
The  MAH  provided  data  summarising  the  median  steady  state  area  under  the  concentration-time  curve 
(AUC) and Cmax ratios of paediatric patients vs adults at the recommended dosage for paediatric patients 
in  Table  7.  Box  plots  displaying  comparisons  of  distributions  of  AUC  and  maximum  (peak)  plasma 
concentration of the drug (Cmax) between adults and children in different ranges of body weight are shown 
in Figure 6 and Figure 7 respectively. The source of AUC values for adults used in the calculations was 
the observed data from adult subjects with multidrug resistant-tuberculosis (MDR-TB) who received a 100 
mg  twice  daily  (BID)  treatment  regimen  of  delamanid  in  Trial  242-07-204.  The  data  for  the  adult  Cmax 
values  were  derived  from  the  adult  patients  with  post-hoc  parameter  estimates  in  the  Population 
Pharmacokinetic  (Pop  PK)  model.  Since  non-clinical  and  clinical  pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic 
(PK/PD)  analysis  suggested  AUC/minimum  inhibitory  concentration  is  considered  an  efficacy  driver  of 
delamanid  (Otsuka  Report  No.  025547),  the  minimum  (trough)  plasma  concentration  of  the  drug  (Cmin) 
may not be relevant justification of the paediatric dosage. The box plots and median ratio for Cmin are also 
presented in Figure 8 and Table 7, respectively, as requested.

The CHMP assessed the boxplots of distributions of AUCss, Cmaxss and Cminss in the paediatric weight groups 
as requested, compared to the corresponding PK metrics in adults receiving 100 mg BID. The CHMP was of 
the view that the results are consistent with the proposed dose of 50 mg BID in 30-50 kg. For the >50 kg 
group, the adult dose is proposed consistently with the fact the median weight in the adult study was 55 
kg. This is endorsed. 
The CHMP assessed the choice of weight bands proposed by the MAH and the selected threshold of 30 kg 
selected for children with an age limit of 6 years and older. For the 40 kg to 50 kg weight band, it is 
predicted that both 50 mg and 100 mg BID provide similar AUC (i.e., the AUC ratio of paediatric patients 
to adults is 0.931 and 1.21, respectively, in the Pop PK report (Otsuka Report No. 242-19-259, Table 8-
5). Since DOSE = 100 mg is treated as categorical covariate of relative bioavailability, it is difficult to 
simulate the exposure between 50 mg and 100 mg. By comparing the point estimates and distribution, 
50 mg BID is considered to be closer to the exposure in adults, thus 50 mg BID is selected as the optimal 
dose.  
In agreement with the PIP children recruited for the paediatric Trial 242-11-232 and Trial 242-11-233 
have been subdivided into 4 age groups (0 to 2, 3 to 5, 6 to 12, and 13 to 17 years of age) and dosed 
according to age groups. Doses applied to children 12 to 17 years of age were the adult dose of 100 mg 
delamanid BID and to children 11 to 6 years of age 50 mg delamanid BID when both age groups received 
the adult tablet formulation (50-mg film-coated tablet) in paediatric trials while younger children received 
delamanid DPF. However, PK/PD analysis in paediatric patients assessing the paediatric dose for children 
that will result in delamanid systemic exposure comparable to that in adults following the approved dose 
suggests weight-based dosing in children. The current line extension for the use of delamanid in children 
6 to 17 years of age is based on an interim analysis of Trial 242-12-233 for these paediatric age groups, 
which had completed the trial whereas the trial was still ongoing in younger children. 
Assessment report  
EMA/526836/2020 
Page 30/68 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
When delamanid dosing is suggested based on the simulation results, children with a weight of < 30 kg 
should receive the DPF, which is available in 5 mg and 25 mg dispersible tablet strength. As the clinical 
Trial 242-12-233 using the DPF was still ongoing and final results on safety and efficacy for the use of the 
DPF were not available at the time of the interim analysis (data cut-off 13 Dec 2016), the current 
indication extension proposes that the 30 kg threshold be used. Additionally, the interim analysis included 
only children older than 6 years of age and therefore using a conservative approach, the MAH suggested 
the age (> 6 years) as well as the weight band (> 30 kg). For children with a body weight < 30 kg the 
existing 50 mg film-coated tablets would not be considered the optimal strength. Therefore, dosing 
proposals for these children will be included in the upcoming 2nd type II variation addressing the younger 
age groups. With this variation the MAH will also submit an extension application to establish the 
delamanid dispersible tablets which are more appropriate for administration in children with younger age 
and lower body weight. 
Of note, the > 50 kg subgroup was underrepresented in the model building dataset (only 3 children 
included), and the model-based simulations are therefore not reliable for this subgroup. The dose 
proposed is the adult dose, which is agreed since the median weight in the adult Pop PK data (Trial 242-
17-256) population is 55 kg. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No specific studies have been conducted in the paediatric population. The presentation and treatment of 
pulmonary tuberculosis is similar in adults and paediatric patients aged from approximately 10 years so 
that an extrapolation of safety and efficacy data obtained from adults is acceptable. 
The presentation of clinical disease may be different in children aged less than approximately 10 years 
compared to adults but the response to treatment may be comparable at least from the age of five years 
upwards, supporting the possibility of extrapolating efficacy documented in adults to this age group. 
2.4.4.  PK/PD modelling 
A PK/PD modelling analysis including trial 233 data to determine the relationship between delamanid and 
DM-6705 plasma concentrations and changes in QTc interval will be performed. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
A population PK modelling approach was used to inform doses to be used in children of 6 to 17 y, 
assuming that similar PK exposure as in adults should lead to similar response to delamanid. This is 
acceptable as other factors that also impact overall response to treatment are also comparable in adult 
and paediatric populations: these include disease stage and concomitant medications. Additionally, it 
should be kept in mind that Deltyba obtained a conditional approval and that there is still uncertainty on 
the optimal dose in the adult population. 
As regards the Pop PK model development and evaluation, the methods used are overall considered state 
of the art. The MAH provided a discussion on the scientific plausibility of the covariates tested on the 
different model parameters. Collinearity/correlation were tested between continuous covariates and 
between categorical vs continuous. 
The boxplots of distributions of AUCss, Cmaxss and Cminss in the paediatric weight groups, compared to the 
corresponding PK metrics in adults receiving 100 mg BID, are consistent with the proposed dose of 50 mg 
BID in 30-50 kg. For the >50 kg group, the adult dose is proposed consistently with the fact the median

weight in the adult study was 55 kg. This is endorsed. 
In the absence of a concentration-corrected-QT interval modelling analysis (PK/PD) with completed Trial 
242-12-233, it is hard to assess the available laboratory data on the prolongation of the QTc interval. 
Linear QTc/RR regression is a well-known and easy to apply technique providing an accurate estimate of 
the remaining influence of the RR-interval on the corrected QT-intervals. Optimal QTc correction should 
be independent of the RR-interval, the linear regression slope and R² should be 0. The CHMP noted the 
MAH commitment to submit the detailed report on the concentration-corrected-QT interval modelling 
analysis in the upcoming 2nd Type II variation addressing the younger age groups. 
While awaiting this analysis to support the safety assessment of the proposed paediatric dose regimen, 
the MAH was requested to provide a thorough discussion of the risk of QT-interval in more detail, in 
particular the relationship between QT-prolongation, dosages given/weight, time to onset, and data on 
serum concentration of DM-6705 at time of event, if possible. The MAH was also asked to discuss the 
clinical consequences of the increase of this surrogate marker in the paediatric population. 
The MAH stated that in vitro studies have shown that delamanid inhibits hERG channel (cardiac potassium 
channel); however, in pre-clinical studies, prolongation of the QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) 
was observed only with repeated delamanid dosing, while single doses of delamanid showed no effect on 
electrocardiograph (ECG) QTc interval. It has been postulated that metabolites of delamanid, and in 
particular DM-6705 (which results from metabolism of delamanid in plasma by albumin), may be 
primarily responsible for prolongation of QTc. This hypothesis is supported by the in vitro effect of DM-
6705 and other delamanid metabolites on HEK-293 and CHO-K1 cells that express hERG channels. 
In the delamanid Phase 2 clinical Trial 242-07-204, Day 56 Cmax values were used to compute predictions 
for QTc change from baseline, and the highest DM-6705 concentrations were observed on Day 56, and 
the QTc prolongation reversed after drug was discontinued on the same day. Therefore, DM-6705 
concentrations were identified as a surrogate marker for QTc prolongation. Around 3% of patients 
experienced an increase of 60 ms in QTc interval corrected for heart rate by Fredericia’s formula (QTcF) 
or greater at some point during the trial, and QTcF greater than 500 ms was observed in 10% and 13% 
of patients receiving delamanid 100 mg BID and 200 mg BID, respectively. However, no clinical cardiac 
manifestations, Torsades de Pointes (TdP) arrhythmias, or temporary related arrhythmias were reported 
among those patients. The QTc interval prolongation developed slowly over time in the first 6 to 10 weeks 
of treatment and remained stable thereafter, corresponding to the time to steady state of DM-6705. 
A concentration-corrected-QT interval modelling analysis (PK/PD) is completed and results are integrated 
in the updated PopPK/PD report (Otsuka Report No. 242-19-259). 
Based on the linear mixed effects modelling, the concentration of delamanid does not have a significant 
impact on ΔQTc interval corrected for heart rate by Bazett’s formula (QTcB) (slope for delamanid: 
0.00792 ms/[ng/mL], 90% confidence interval [CI]: −0.00132, 0.0172), whereas a significant positive 
correlation was detected for the concentration of DM-6705 (slope for DM-6705: 0.0613 ms/[ng/mL], 90% 
CI: 0.016, 0.107). Based on this regression model between QTcB and DM-6705 and the observed 
metabolic ratio to DM-6705 in Trial 242-12-232, ΔQTcB are simulated with the recommended regimen 
and the results are found in Table 8 
Due to lack of placebo data, ΔΔQTcB cannot be derived in this analysis. However, the model-predicted 
that the upper bounds of the 90% CIs of ΔQTcB values were all less than 1 ms at the simulated Cmax of 
DM-6705 following the recommended regimen, suggesting that there is unlikely to be a clinically 
meaningful effect on the QT interval.

Table 8 Model Predicted ΔQTcB with Recommended Dose  
The overall incidence of drug-induced TdP is generally unknown for paediatric populations, but paediatric 
cases of QTc interval prolongation and TdP have been associated with various drugs, including dopamine 
antagonists (domperidone, risperidone), antiarrhythmic agents (amiodarone, procainamide, and sotalol), 
and antifungals (fluconazole and voriconazole). 
A literature review involving multiple prospective cohorts in various age groups among children receiving 
domperidone, none of the patients had a QTc interval above 500 ms or experienced an increase in QTc 
interval of more than 60 ms relative to the pre-treatment value; however, drug-induced QTc interval 
prolongation to greater than 450 ms has been noted as a reason for concern. Fortunately, none of the 
patients in this analysis experienced TdP or sudden cardiac death. 
Drug-induced QTc interval prolongation and TdP are usually attributed to predisposing risk factors 
including female sex; advanced age (> 65 years); hypokalaemia, hypomagnesemia, or hypocalcaemia; 
heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; bradycardia; treatment with more than 1 QTc interval-
prolonging drug; and conditions leading to elevated plasma concentrations of such drugs, such as kidney 
or liver disease, drug interactions, and rapid IV administration. It is generally unknown which of these 
risk factors would apply to paediatric populations; however, hypokalaemia, hypomagnesemia, 
bradycardia, and elevated plasma concentrations of QTc interval-prolonging drugs have been postulated 
as potential risk factors for paediatric patients similar to adults. Additionally, female sex at or following 
puberty has been identified as a risk factor for QTc interval prolongation and TdP. 
In the delamanid Phase 2 clinical Trial 242-07-204 in adult patients, the QTc interval prolongation 
developed slowly over time in the first 6 to 10 weeks of treatment and remained stable thereafter, 
corresponding to the time to steady state of DM-6705.

Regarding the modelling-based proposed dose regimen in the paediatric population with a body weight 
above 30 kg, the MAH completed the concentration-corrected-QT interval modelling analysis (PK/PD). The 
results are integrated in the updated PopPK/PD report (Otsuka Report No. 242-19-259). This updated 
study report has not been provided by the MAH, but the results of the model predicted ΔQTcB interval are 
provided and discussed. Based on the linear mixed effects modelling, there was a significant positive 
correlation between the concentration of DM-6705 and ΔQTcB. The upper bounds of the 90% CIs of 
ΔQTcB values were all less than 10 ms at the simulated Cmax of DM-6705 following the recommended 
regimen. 
The C-QT modelling using linear mixed effects approach is in principle only valuable to model observed 
concentrations when large enough concentration ranges are covered (including at least 2x therapeutic), in 
order to be able to exclude or not a clinically relevant effect (10ms) on the average. A 6-7ms 
prolongation at therapeutic dose can definitely lead to >10ms at supratherapeutic concentrations, and 
therefore a QT effect cannot be ruled out. Nothing precise can be concluded on the actual effect size 
when only therapeutic doses are used. 
The CHMP noted that the MAH only reported ΔQTcB. As stated in the EMA guideline on the through QT 
analysis, Bazett’s correction is frequently used in clinical practice and in the medical literature. In general, 
however, Bazett’s correction overcorrects at elevated heart rates and under corrects at heart rates below 
60 bpm and hence is not an ideal correction. Fridericia’s correction is more accurate than Bazett’s 
correction in subjects with such altered heart rates and the MAH was therefore asked to also report model 
predicted ΔQTcF. 
In the QTC concentration-response analysis in trial 242-09-213 for the adult population, predicted mean 
placebo-adjusted ΔQTcF values were slightly higher than the corresponding predicted mean placebo-
adjusted ΔQTcB values. The highest placebo-adjusted ΔQTcF was predicted for DM-6705 at Week 8, with 
the value of 7.10 ms and upper bound of one-sided 95% CI of 8.14 ms predicted by the nonlinear model. 
The corresponding values from the linear model were 6.93 ms and 7.75 ms. 
The currently provided data suggest that if 50 mg BID is used for paediatric patients weighing 30-50 kg 
and 100 mg BID for those above 50 kg, the model-predicted ΔQTc values will be in the same range as 
those observed in the adult population. 
The MAH stated that from a scientific perspective the QT correction method used should show no 
relationship between QT interval and RR1. The MAH therefore evaluated the relationship between RR and 
QT/QTc intervals via scatterplots using data at drug-free state on Day −1. As shown in Figure 9, QTc by 
Fridericia’s correction showed significant correlation with heart rate (P < 0.01, R2 = 0.484), while this 
correlation was greatly reduced after the Bazett’s correction (P = 0.026, R2 = 0.044). 
Thus, QTcB was determined to be a more adequate correction method for heart rate than QTcF for the 
current population. This observation is consistent with a previous article that evaluated various heart rate 
correction formulas in children2. This article concluded that “The Fridericia’s correction may work well for 
adults, in whom average heart rates tend to be 60 - 90 bpm. However, children, especially infants, tend 
to have average heart rates well above 100 bpm. Therefore, the Bazett correction may be more 
appropriate for drug safety trials and clinical studies involving infants and young children.”

Figure 9 Linear regression of QT, QTcB and QTcF versus RR Plots 
Although QTcF was concluded as not appropriate for the current population, as per the CHMP request, a 
linear regression analysis was conducted between ΔQTcF and the concentration of delamanid and DM-
6705, separately. Based on the linear mixed effects modelling, a significant positive correlation was 
detected for the concentration of delamanid and DM-6705 (slope for delamanid: 0.0154 ms/[ng/mL], 
90% CI: 0.00703 to 0.0237; slope for DM-6705: 0.117 ms/[ng/mL], 90% CI: 0.0797 to 0.155). By using 
these regression models between ΔQTcF and delamanid/DM-6705, ΔQTcFs are simulated with 
recommended regimen in Table 9. The model-predicted upper bounds of the 90% CIs of ΔQTcF value 
were greater than 10 ms at the simulated Cmax of DM-6705 following all dosing regimens of interest. 
Although this evaluation might not be appropriate, since the effect of heart rate on QT is not sufficiently 
corrected by QTcF, the model predicted ΔQTcF and ΔQTcB point estimates show no clinical meaningful 
differences. Therefore, it can be concluded that the results from the model estimating ΔQTcF re-confirm 
the initially reported results.

The CHMP was of the view that QT correction methods developed for adults do not automatically apply to 
children. Linear QTc/RR regression is a well-known and easy to apply technique providing an accurate 
estimate of the remaining influence of the RR-interval on the corrected QT-intervals. Optimal QTc 
correction should indeed be independent of the RR-interval, the linear regression slope and R² should be 
03. Wernicke et al4 proposed, for clinical trials, to derive a population-specific correction factor ‘e’ in the 
formula QTc = QT/RRe, based on pre-treatment ECG data from the population being studied. 
In their study, ECG data were obtained from a meta-analysis of seven clinical trials for attention 
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) involving 2,288 children and adolescents 6 to 17 years of age. The 
most appropriate formula for children and adolescents included in this database was found to be QTc = 
QT/RR0.38. This is closer to Fridericia’s correction QTc = QT/RR0.33 than to Bazett’s correction QTc = 
QT/RR0.5. 
In this case, the MAH followed a similar methodology evaluating the relationship between RR and QT/QTc 
intervals via scatterplots using data at drug-free state on Day −1. The optimal correction factor exponent 
‘e’ was not determined, but the analysis showed that Bazett’s correction was closer to the optimal 
correction (slope = 0.03, R² = 0.044) than Fridericia’s correction (slope = 0.128, R² = 0.484). It is, 
therefore, considered appropriate to use Bazett’s correction for the current paediatric population from 6 
to 17 years of age in the paediatric study. 
Regarding the modelling-based proposed dose regimen in the paediatric population with a body weight 
above 30 kg, the MAH previously completed the concentration-corrected-QT interval modelling analysis 
(PK/PD). Based on the linear mixed effects modelling, there was a significant positive correlation between 
the concentration of DM-6705 and ΔQTcB. The upper bounds of the 90% CIs of ΔQTcB values were all

less than 10 ms at the simulated Cmax of DM-6705 following the recommended regimen. The upper 
bounds of the 90% CIs of ΔQTcF values were above 10 ms at the simulated Cmax of DM-6705 following 
the recommended regimen. However, in this population from 6 to 17 years of age, Bazett’s correction is 
to be preferred. 
Administration of delamanid has been shown to result in QT interval prolongation in the adult population 
and based on this simulation, this is also the case in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. 
Appropriate warning on QT interval prolongation is included in the SmPC.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Main study 
Title of Study 
Trial 242-12-233: Phase 2, Open-label, Multiple-dose Trial to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, 
Pharmacokinetics, and Efficacy of Delamanid (OPC-67683) in Pediatric Multidrugresistant Tuberculosis 
Patients on Therapy with an Optimized Background Regimen of Antituberculosis Drugs over a 6-Month 
Treatment Period 
Methods 
This is a phase 2, open-label, multi-dose, multi-centre trial to assess the safety, tolerability, PK, and 
efficacy of delamanid tablets plus OBR in paediatric subjects with MDR-TB over a 6-month period. This 
long-term trial is an extension of Trial 232, and only subjects who have completed Trial 232 are eligible to 
participate in this trial (Trial 233). 
Trial 233 is conducted sequentially in 4 groups of paediatric subjects. 
As Trial 242-12-233 is still ongoing, all results presented in this efficacy update are based on an interim 
analysis of children 6 to 17 years of age, all of whom have completed the study. 
This trial is being conducted at 3 sites qualified to treat paediatric subjects with MDR-TB. 
Study participants 
At least 36 male and female paediatric MDR-TB patients ages birth to 17 years of age, inclusive, who 
successfully completed paediatric PK trial 232 and must rollover from trial 232 within 30 days of 
completing that trial. 
Subjects were assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups based on age: 
•  Group 1: ages 12 to 17 years (minimum of 6 subjects, at least 2, but no more than 5 females) 
•  Group 2: ages 6 to 11 years (minimum of 6 subjects) 
•  Group 3: ages 3 to 5 years (minimum of 12 subjects) 
•  Group 4: ages birth to 2 years (minimum of 12 subjects)

Treatments 
Delamanid was administered for 6 months (182 days) 
•  Group 1: Adult formulation delamanid 100 mg twice daily (BID) + OBR 
•  Group 2: Adult formulation delamanid 50 mg BID + OBR 
•  Group 3: DPF 25 mg BID + OBR 
•  Group 4: DPF dose based on body weight during baseline visit: 
o  Subject > 10 kg will receive DPF 10 mg BID + OBR 
o  Subject > 8 and ≤ 10 kg will receive DPF 5 mg BID + OBR 
o  Subject ≤ 8 kg will receive DPF 5 mg once daily (QD) + OBR 
o  Delamanid dose will be adjusted as needed for Group 4 subjects based on the weight 
measurement at specified study visits (Visits 5, 7, 9, 11 and 12). 
One dose per day for a minimum of 5 days per week will be given under direct observation. It is 
recommended that all delamanid doses be administered under fed conditions in the morning and evening. 
It is also recommended that delamanid be dosed within 30 minutes of the start of a meal, if possible. 
Optimally, OBR medications should be given at least 1 hour prior to or 1 hour after dosing of delamanid. 
Delamanid is added to an optimised background regimen (OBR) for the treatment of MDR-TB as per the 
World Health Organization Guidelines for the Programmatic Management of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis, 
relevant national guidelines for treating MDR-TB, and the investigator’s best clinical judgment. OBR 
generally comprises 4 or more classes of first-line (other than isoniazid and rifampicin) and second-line 
anti-TB medications to which the patient’s strain of MTB has suspected or documented susceptibility 
based on previous treatment history and epidemiologic and clinical factors. 
Whenever possible, 5 or more classes of drugs are preferred for use in treatment, particularly in the initial 
stage of treatment. The components of OBR include: 
1) Any remaining first-line anti-TB medications to which the patient’s isolates are likely 
susceptible such as pyrazinamide 
Assessment report  
EMA/526836/2020 
Page 39/68 
 
 
  
  
2) An anti-TB medication given by injection; preferred order of selection: amikacin > kanamycin 
>Capreomycin 
3) Fluoroquinolone class; preferred order of selection: moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin > 
ofloxacin (gatifloxacin to be used with caution secondary to rare but severe side effect of 
dysglycaemia; ciprofloxacin not recommended for use). Moxifloxacin causes QT interval 
prolongation and should not be used in this trial 
Other medications include (but are not limited to): 
4) Ethionamide or prothionamide 
5) Cycloserine 
6) Para-aminosalicyclic acid 
Objectives 
The primary objectives of this trial are: 
• 
• 
To evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of delamanid and its metabolites in 
combination with an OBR during a 6-month treatment period in paediatric subjects with MDR-TB 
for the age-specific delamanid doses determined in Trial 232 
To report delamanid and metabolite plasma concentrations at each visit day by age groups and to 
conduct a population PK analysis of delamanid when delamanid is administered in combination 
with an OBR during a 6-month treatment period in paediatric subjects with MDR-TB 
The secondary objectives are: 
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate the PK/PD relationship of delamanid and its metabolite plasma concentrations 
and change in QTc when delamanid is administered in combination with OBR during a 6-month 
treatment period in paediatric subjects with MDR-TB 
To evaluate the efficacy of delamanid when administered in combination with an OBR during a 6-
month treatment period in paediatric subjects with MDR-TB 
To determine the palatability of the DPF (applicable for Groups 3 and 4 only) 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoints in this trial are: 
-  Safety and tolerability: Changes in physical examination including visual testing and audiometry 
during screening, TEAEs, vital signs, ECGs, Holter monitoring (if applicable), and clinical 
laboratory tests. 
- 
Pharmacokinetics: Descriptive statistics of delamanid and metabolite plasma concentrations. 
Delamanid PK data from this trial will be combined with PK data from the Trial 232 and analysed 
using population PK methods. 
The secondary endpoints in this trial are: 
- 
- 
Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics: PK/PD analysis for changes in QTc as a function of 
delamanid and metabolite (DM-6705) plasma concentrations. 
Efficacy: Culture conversion, normal chest radiography results, resolution of TB symptoms. 
Assessment report  
EMA/526836/2020 
Page 40/68 
 
 
  
  
The efficacy of delamanid tablets in treating paediatric MDR-TB subjects is assessed by chest radiography 
(subjects with pulmonary disease), body weight/height, and resolution of TB symptoms (based on 
investigator evaluation). In addition, when available, sputum culture conversion (for culture-positive 
subjects) will be assessed in subjects who are able to produce sputum (or provide other biological 
specimens) for microbiological evaluation. Although microbiological assessment of sputum or other 
biological specimens is not required as part of this protocol, if collected by the investigator as part of 
routine subject management, all available results for smear microscopy, culture, identification, and drug 
susceptibility will be captured as an unscheduled visit. The final treatment outcome is a World Health 
Organisation (WHO) defined outcome and will be assessed by the investigator at 24 months of initial 
investigational medicinal product (IMP) dose. For the assessment of treatment outcome, culture and/or 
other clinical results could be taken into account. 
- 
Palatability: The palatability of the DPF (Groups 3 and 4 only) is assessed using an age-
appropriate visual hedonic scale and clinical assessment. 
Sample size 
No formal sample size calculations were performed.  
Randomisation 
Randomisation of patients was not planned. 
Blinding (masking) 
This is an open-label, non-controlled trial. 
Statistical methods 
No formal statistical analysis is planned due to the small sample sizes; all statistical presentations are 
descriptive. 
Subject Samples: 
•  Safety Sample: Comprises the subjects who have received any amount of study medication in 
Trial 233, regardless of any protocol deviation or violation. 
• 
Efficacy Sample: Comprises all subjects with at least one efficacy endpoint available, the efficacy 
end points include: 1) chest radiograph result; 2) investigator assessed clinical signs and 
symptoms of tuberculosis; 3) microbiologic assessment of sputum; 4) evaluable change from 
baseline in body weight or height at treatment. 
Safety parameters are summarised by incidence rates and their change from baseline if applicable. 
Change from baseline is summarised for observed cases at each scheduled post-baseline visit and for the 
last visit.

Conduct of the study 
Figure 10 Schematic trial design 
Trial 233 consists of: The screening period, baseline, treatment period (6 months DLM+OBR), post-
treatment period (8 weeks OBR) and follow-up period with a visit at 6 months after the last delamanid 
dose and an additional treatment outcome follow-up one year after this last follow-up visit. 
For the treatment outcome follow-up, all patients will either visit the clinic or be contacted by telephone 
for clinical assessment. Collection of treatment outcome information as routinely documented in the 
patient medical records or in national TB program. 
Baseline data 
Subjects were enrolled at 3 sites, 2 sites in the Philippines and 1 site in South-Africa. The race was Asian 
for 11 subjects (84.6 %).

Table 11 Subject Demographics (Safety Sample) 
The majority of the subjects had normal audiometry assessments (8 of 13 subjects [61.5%]) and visual 
assessments (11 of 13 subjects [84.6%]) at baseline and abnormal chest x-rays (12 of 13 subjects 
[92.3%]). Baseline was defined as the last pre-dose measurement prior to IMP administration. 
Table 12 Audiometry, Chest X-ray and Visual Assessment 
The investigator-assessed sign and symptom with the highest incidence at baseline was findings on 
recent chest radiograph consistent with TB (11 of 13 subjects [84.6%]).

Table 14 Anti-TB treatment history 
² First line regimen: isoniazid, rifampicin, rifampin, rifabutine, rifapentine, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and 
streptomycin. Second line regimen: amikacin, kanamycin and capreomycin. 
The CHMP noted that the microbiological confirmation of the current treatment episode of MDR-TB is 
based on the patient’s history and could have been several months before screening for trial 232 (and 
233) – up to 5 months for group I and up to almost 1 year for group II. The CHMP therefore requested 
the MAH to discuss the patients’ clinical, radiographic and culture response to the past tuberculosis 
treatment at baseline of trial 233 as the patients have already been treated for several months (before 
and during trial 232) for their current MDR-TB episode. 
The MAH confirmed that all patients enrolled in Trial 242-12-232 and Trial 242-12-233 were required to 
have a recent diagnosis of confirmed or probable MDR-TB and to be on at least 2 weeks of an optimised 
background treatment regimen (OBR). At baseline, historical data including past TB treatment (that 
would include recent OBR), date of diagnosis, and site of disease were collected. In addition, signs and 
symptoms of active TB, along with smear microscopy data, were collected immediately prior to delamanid 
administration in order to establish a baseline status prior to the start of dosing. These data are 
summarised by age group in synoptic CSR 242-12-233, CT-3.2.2. As additional clinical data were not 
collected prior to the start of the initial background regimen, an assessment of the response of a patient 
to background treatment is not currently possible. 
The CHMP was of the view that regarding the design of the trials, assessment of efficacy is not needed, 
rather it is presumed that these can be bridged from the adult population given similar PK, which is 
acceptable. 
Concomitant anti-TB medications taken prior to the start of trial therapy were (Note that if a patient took 
more than one medication within a drug class, the patient was counted once for the drug class.):

Outcomes and estimation 
Results of chest x-ray and symptoms of TB assessments did not show consistent changes during 
treatment for both age groups. 
Table 16 Chest x-ray results  
Body weight 
Results of changes in body weight show that subjects in Group 1 gained weight over the 12 months with 
a mean (SD) change of 4.6 (3.8) kg, and in Group 2, subjects lost a modest amount with a mean (SD) 
change of -0.4 (3.8) kg. Potentially clinically significant abnormalities in vital signs included changes ≥

5% in body weight. A decrease of ≥ 5% in body weight was only reported for 2 of the 6 subjects (33.3%) 
in Group 2; the percent change from baseline reported after 12 months (at Day 365) was -24.4% for one 
subject and −12.2% for the other subject. An increase of ≥ 5% in body weight was reported for 4 of the 
7 subjects (57.1%) in Group 1 and for 2 of the 6 subjects (33.3%) in Group 2; the percent change from 
baseline reported for the subjects after 12 months (at Day 365) varies from 15.1% to 27.8% in Group 1 
and was 23.3% and 10.2% in Group 2. 
During trial 233, there was only one patient with a smear positive result for acid-fast bacilli. MGIT and 
solid cultures during trial 233 were either not performed or were culture negative. The MAH was therefore 
asked to discuss the patients’ clinical, radiographic and culture response to the tuberculosis treatment at 
the patients’ visits of trial 233 where these have been assessed. For the treatment outcome follow-up at 
24 months, all patients will either visit the clinic or be contacted by telephone for clinical assessment. 
Therefore, a summary and discussion of the data from the last follow-up visit at 6 months after the last 
delamanid dose was also requested. 
The MAH presented the numbers of subjects with specific signs and symptoms of TB assessed by the 
investigator at baseline, at 6 months, and at 6 months after the last dose of delamanid in Trial 242-12-
233. Overall, there was a trend towards a reduction in cough over the course of the trial, notably in the 
oldest age group. There were no consistent changes in signs and symptoms exhibited by subjects overall 
or within age groups over the course of the first year. Cough and weight loss were observed more 
frequently than any of the other signs/symptoms assessed with 20 of 37 (55.5%) subjects exhibiting 
cough and 24 of 37 (66.6%) subjects showing weight loss during the study. However, an examination of 
changes in body weight from baseline to the end of the 6-month follow-up period showed that 29 of 36 
(80.6%) subjects had clinically significant (≥ 5%) increases in body weight. Increases in body weight in 
paediatric TB patients is suggestive of a positive clinical response. Body weights at baseline, at 6 months, 
and at 6 months follow up are presented for each subject by age group. All but 1 of 36 (97.2%) subjects 
had abnormal findings on chest x-rays at baseline. At 6 months, 4 of 33 (12.1%) subjects had normal 
chest x-rays and at 6 months follow up, 3 of 31 (8.8%) subjects had normal chest x-rays. A total of 4 of 
37 (8.8%) subjects had a sputum smear test positive for AFB at baseline. No subjects tested positive on 
any postbaseline sputum test performed. 
The CHMP assessed the data provided by the MAH and considered that no clear trends could be derived. 
As the line extension is based on the presumption that efficacy can be bridged from the adult population, 
given similar PK, this is accepted. 
Summary of final outcome at the end of treatment as assessed by the principal investigator at 24 months 
based on the safety sample: 
Table 17 Treatment outcome at 24 Months (Safety Sample) 
In Groups 1 and 2, 57.1% and 50.0% of subjects, respectively were cured. 
The MAH was requested to clarify on which data the conclusion of cure as treatment outcome is based 
(chest radiography results, resolution of TB signs and symptoms or culture conversion) and to provide the

data supporting the treatment outcomes as well as definitions of the categories ‘Cure’, ‘Treatment 
completed’, ‘Treatment failed’. 
The MAH stated that all patients who completed Trial 242-12-233 were assessed on Day 730 (Month 24) 
+ 2 months for clinical assessment. Determination of final treatment outcomes was not prescribed by the 
protocol; nevertheless, final outcomes were assessed by the treating clinician as per local and/or WHO 
guidance, which in general were based on the standard definitions listed in Table 18. The MAH provided 
the results of these assessments for Trial 242-12-233 in PDATA-15 (19/02/2020).

Table 18 Treatment Outcomes for RR-TB/MDR-TB/XDR-TB Patients treated using Second-line 
treatment  
The CHMP noted that as determination of final treatment outcomes was not prescribed by the protocol 
and it is not clear whether the WHO guidance has been followed, efficacy outcome should not be reported 
in the SmPC for the paediatric population. It is presumed that efficacy can be bridged from the adult 
population given similar PK. The SmPC is revised accordingly.

Notes 
Safety: PK/PD for changes in QTc as a function of delamanid and metabolite 
(DM-6705) plasma concentrations has not yet been performed. 
Efficacy: There are uncertainties related to the diagnosis of tuberculosis in 
the paediatric population and the assessment of treatment outcome. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical studies 232 and 233 are PIP compliant. There is little bias control: trial 233 is an open-label, 
non-controlled and non-randomised study. A very limited number of paediatric patients are included: 7 
patients aged 12–17 years and 6 patients aged 6-11 years. Children with confirmed or presumptive 
diagnosis of pulmonary or extrapulmonary MDR-TB received delamanid during 6 months (the adult 
dosage, i.e. 100 mg BID for patients aged 12-17 years and 50 mg BID for patients aged 6-11 years) in 
addition to an optimised background regimen. Patients will continue on OBR, as prescribed by the 
investigator, and have post-delamanid treatment visits on Days 189, 196, 203, 210, 238 (2-month post 
last dose), and 365 (6-month post last dose). There is a treatment outcome follow-up at 24 months from 
the start of delamanid therapy. So, patients are closely followed until 2 months after stopping delamanid 
treatment. Thereafter, follow-up is limited with one visit 6 months after the last delamanid dose and an 
additional treatment outcome follow-up one year after this last follow-up, which makes it difficult to 
assess sustained SCC. The main endpoints of the study were the evaluation of safety and tolerability and 
PK evaluation. Efficacy was a secondary objective. The efficacy was assessed by chest radiography (in 
patients with pulmonary disease), body weight/height, and resolution of TB symptoms. When available, 
sputum culture conversion was assessed, although microbiological assessment of sputum or other 
biological specimens was not required as part of the protocol.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Evaluation of efficacy is complicated by the more difficult diagnosis in younger patients: Six out of 7 
patients aged 12-17 years had confirmed pulmonary MDR-TB, one probable pulmonary MDR-TB. In 
patient group II aged 6 to 11 years, only 50% had confirmed MDR-TB and 50% had suspected MDR-TB; 
2 patients had pulmonary TB, one extra-pulmonary TB and 3 both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB. 
Secondly, microbiological confirmation of the current episode of MDR-TB is based on the patient’s history 
and for some patients this was several months before screening for trial 232 (and 233) – up to 5 months 
for group I and almost 1 year for group II.  
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The number of patients is too small to draw clear conclusions from the efficacy evaluation. 
Based on the assumption that the response to treatment may be comparable from the age of 5 years 
upwards, approval of the indication in children from 6 to 17 years of age is based on the appropriateness 
of the age-specific dose regimens based on PK data and on an acceptable paediatric safety profile.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The most frequently observed adverse drug reactions in patients treated with delamanid + Optimised 
Background Regimen (OBR) (i.e. incidence > 10%) are nausea (32,9%), vomiting (29,9%), headache 
(27.6%), insomnia (27.3%), dizziness (22.4%), tinnitus (16.5%), hypokalaemia (16.2%), gastritis 
(15.0%), decreased appetite (13.1%), and asthenia (11.3%). 
Safety concerns associated with the use of delamanid in the EU Risk Management Plan version 3.2 include 
the important identified risks of QT interval prolongation, paraesthesia, hypoaethesia, tremor, depression, 
anxiety, insomnia, drug resistance, and gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, vomiting, and gastritis), and 
the important potential risks of tinnitus, blurred vision, hypokalaemia, liver disorders, cortisol level 
increase, drug use during pregnancy, and breastfeeding. 
Patient exposure 
Trial 233 
All but 1 of the 13 subjects analysed for the interim analysis of trial 233 were exposed to at least 6 
months of the investigational medicinal product (IMP). One subject in Group 1 (ages 12 - 17) missed all 
doses for the last 80 days of treatment. 
In trial 233, in Group 1 (ages 12 - 17), total subject days of IMP exposure was 1196 days for the 7 
subjects and 1092 days for the 6 subjects in Group 2 (ages 6 – 11). 
Trial 232 and 233 
Total clinical trial exposure by duration of exposure and by age group and gender is given in the tables 
below: 
Table 20 SIII.1 Clinical Trial Exposure to Delamanid (Cumulative for all indications) 
Table 21 SIII.2: Clinical Trial Exposure to Delamanid by Age Group and Gender  
Current exposure in the paediatric population is very low and prohibits drawing clear conclusions on the 
clinical safety of delamanid in this population.

Adverse events 
Trial 232 age 0 to 17 years 
•  Overall a total of 126 TEAEs were reported by 31 of 37 subjects (83.8%). 
• 
The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  were  vomiting  (9  of  37  subjects  [24.3%])  followed  by 
hyperuricaemia (5 of 37 subjects [13.5%]), nausea (5 of 37 subjects [13.5%]), and toothache (5 
of 37 subjects [13.5%]). 
•  All 12 subjects (100.0%) aged 0 to 2 years experienced ≥ 1 TEAE during the trial followed by 9 of 
12 subjects (75.0%) aged 3 to 5 years, 5 of 6 subjects (83.3%) aged 6 to 11 years, and 5 of 7 
subjects (71.4%) aged 12 to 17. There was no clinically meaningful difference of TEAE incidences 
across all age groups. 
•  Most  TEAEs  were  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity  except  for  the  TEAE  of  lower  respiratory  tract 
infection, which was considered to be severe in intensity. 
•  Of 37, 9 subjects (24.3%) subjects experienced ≥ 1 TEAE that was related to the IMP; the most 
frequently reporting terms were diarrhoea (2 subjects [5.4%]) and ECG QT prolongation (2 subjects 
[5.4%]). 
•  All IMP-related TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. 
• 
There were no IMP-related TEAEs experienced by subjects aged 12 to 17 years and 3 subjects each 
from  all  other  age  groups  reported  IMP-related  TEAEs.  There  were  no  clinically  meaningful 
differences between the age groups. 
•  Overall, eosinophilia (2 of 37 subjects (5.4%]; 1 subject aged 3 - 5 and 1 subject aged 0 - 2) and 
neutropenia (1 of 37 subjects (2.7%]; 1 subject aged 3 - 5) were the TEAEs reported for blood and 
lymphatic system disorders. One incidence of eosinophilia and neutropenia were assessed as IMP-
related TEAEs. 
•  No  subject  had  an  abnormal  physical  examination  finding  that  was  considered  to  be  clinically 
significant. 
• 
Potentially  clinically  significant  abnormalities  in  vital  signs  only  included  changes  ≥  5%  in  body 
weight for 8 subjects across all age groups. A decrease ≥ 5% in body weight was only reported for 
1 of 37 subjects (2.7%). An increase of ≥ 5% in body weight was reported for 7 of 37 subjects 
(18.9%) which can be considered as a benefit for the purpose of this trial. 
•  Overall, 2 of 12 subjects (16.7%) aged 3 to 5 years experienced TEAEs related to ECGs; 1 subject 
experienced  PR  prolongation,  QT  prolongation,  and  presence  of  U  wave  and  the  other  subject 
experienced QT prolongation. These incidences were reported as IMP-related TEAEs. 
•  No clinically relevant differences were noted for clinical laboratory results, ECGs, vital signs, physical 
findings, or other observations relating to safety parameters. 
Trial 233 
-  As of the data cut-off date of 13 Dec 2016, the 13 subjects analysed for this interim analysis 
experienced a total of 105 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Out of these, 88 TEAEs 
were on treatment, defined as TEAE occurring before end of IMP administration and were 
reported in all 13 subjects (100.0%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/526836/2020 
Page 54/68 
 
 
  
  
 
- 
The 3 most frequently reported adverse events (AEs) were headache (8 subjects [61.5%]), upper 
respiratory tract infection (7 subjects [53.8%]), and arthralgia (5 subjects [38.5%]). 
-  Causally related TEAEs defined as those having a possible or definitive relationship to the IMP 
were reported for 2 subjects (15.4%). One subject experienced nonserious events of arthralgia, 
headache, and butterfly rash and for another subject a nonserious event of dizziness; all were 
assessed as possibly related to IMP. 
-  No notable findings were observed with audiometry and visual assessments. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Trial 232 age 0 to 17 years 
•  No subject had a fatal outcome during the trial 
• 
Two subjects (5.4%) each had a SAE; for one subject the SAE was hepatitis A (aged 3 to 5 years) 
and for the other subject the SAE was lower respiratory tract infection (aged 0 - 2  years). Both 
SAEs were not related to IMP. 
Trial 233 
-  As of the cut-off date of 13 Dec 2016, no deaths have been reported in Trial 242-12-233. 
-  As of the cut-off date of 13 Dec 2016, 1 of 13 subjects (7.7%) experienced a serious adverse 
event. The subject was 10 years old and experienced an event of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma that 
was of severe intensity and not related to the IMP. 
Laboratory findings 
Trial 232 age 0 to 17 years 
•  Concurrent  elevation  of  transaminases  (≥  3  ×  ULN)  and  bilirubin  levels  (≥  2  ×  ULN)  was 
experienced by 1 subject (2.7%) with diagnosed hepatitis A. 
•  No clinically relevant differences were noted for clinical laboratory results, ECGs, vital signs, physical 
findings, or other observations relating to safety parameters. 
The CHMP noted that changes to ECGs were recorded in the majority of study patients, with the oldest 
group of paediatric patients (group 1) having fewer ECG abnormalities compared to the younger age 
cohorts. (4 of 7 subjects [57.1%] in Group 1, 5 of 6 subjects [83.3%] in Group 2, 10 of 12 subjects in 
Group 3 [83.3%], and 11 of 12 subjects [91.6%] in Group 4). The most commonly reported ECG rhythm 
abnormalities were sinus tachycardia and sinus bradycardia. Of the new ECG conduction abnormalities 
reported in 23 of 37 subjects (62.1%) the most frequently observed were intraventricular conduction 
defects, prolonged QTc and 1st degree AV block. Regarding the investigational TEAEs of special interest, 
no new onset changes > 500 msec in QTcB or QTcF were reported. None of the reported ECG changes led 
to withdrawal of study treatment. Overall, the CHMP considered the changes in ECG findings to be within 
acceptable limits. The ECG and QT changes described are known to be associated with adult delamanid 
use and are documented in Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Trial 233 
The assessment of clinical laboratory tests did not show any clinically relevant changes from baseline for 
both age groups or any significant effect of delamanid. Although sporadic and transient excursions 
Assessment report  
EMA/526836/2020 
Page 55/68 
 
 
  
  
outside the normal range were observed for laboratory values, no clinically relevant trends in clinical 
laboratory parameters were readily apparent or resulted in discontinuation from the trial. 
QT interval prolongation is discussed further below in the section ‘Adverse events of special interest’. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Safety concerns associated with the use of delamanid in the paediatric population are aligned with the EU 
Risk Management Plan version 3.2. These include the important identified risks of QT interval 
prolongation, paraesthesia, hypoaethesia, tremor, depression, anxiety, insomnia, drug resistance, and 
gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, vomiting, and gastritis), and the important potential risks of tinnitus, 
blurred vision, hypokalaemia, liver disorders, cortisol level increase, drug use during pregnancy, and 
breastfeeding. 
There were no SAEs, no drug-related TEAEs, and no discontinuations of IMP due to any of these safety 
concerns reported for subjects in Group 1 (ages 12 to 17 years) or Group 2 (ages 6 to 11 years) in Trial 
242-12-233. 
QT interval prolongation 
Administration of delamanid has been shown to result in QT interval prolongation, an effect associated 
primarily with DM-6705 plasma concentrations and to a lesser extent with delamanid and other 
metabolite plasma concentrations. DM-6705 accumulates slowly over time to reach maximal 
concentrations after 2 months of treatment. A 6-month open-label trial of delamanid in adults with MDR-
TB (Trial 242-07-208) showed that QTcF interval prolongation did not increase beyond 2 months of 
treatment. In the placebo-controlled Trial 242-07-204, in MDR-TB adult patients receiving 100 mg 
delamanid twice daily, the mean placebo corrected increases in QTcF from baseline were 7.6 msec at 1 
month and 12.1 msec at 2 months. Three percent of patients experienced an increase of 60 msec or 
greater at some point during Trial 242-07-204, and 1 patient exhibited a QTcF interval > 500 msec. 
In the double-blind placebo-controlled Trial 242-09-213, the maximum mean placebo corrected value for 
QTcF reached 5.9 msec. 
In the paediatric Trial 242-12-232, a clinical study with a delamanid treatment of 10 days, there were no 
clinically meaningful differences in the mean changes from baseline for the various ECG parameters 
across the age groups (0 to 17 years). The mean change from baseline for QTcF reached 4.4 msec at Day 
10. 
The effects of delamanid on QT interval prolongation in paediatric subjects with MDR-TB have been 
examined in a small number of subjects (13) aged 6 to 17 years in Trial 242-12-233. There were no SAEs 
or any AEs of QT prolongation. These data showed a mean change from baseline for QTcF of 17.5 msec. 
Five subjects (38.4%) [3 of 7 subjects (42.8%) in Group 1 (ages 12 to 17 years), 2 of 7 subjects 
(33.3%) in Group 2 (ages 6 to 11 years)] had new onset changes > 450 msec in QTcF. No subject 
exhibited a QTcF interval > 480 msec. Seven of 13 subjects in trial 233 experienced an increase ≥ 30 
and ≤ 60 msec (5, 71.4 % in Group 1 and 2, 33.3 % in Group 2). For one patient from group 1 and one 
patient from group 2, this was reported during delamanid treatment and after D182, i.e. after the 
delamanid treatment period. One subject (1 of 13 subjects, 7.6%) [1 of 7 subjects (14.2%) in Group 1 
(12-17 years)] experienced an increase of > 60 msec between Days 84 and 126, i.e. when delamanid 
was stopped for this patient. No cases of Torsades de Pointes were reported. Eleven of 13 patients 
reported a new conduction abnormality.

Table 23 QTC Mean Change from Baseline in Electrocardiogram Parameters (Fridericia 
correction) 
Baseline was defined as the average of the ECGs taken at Day 1 
A concentration-corrected-QT interval modelling analysis is planned to be submitted with completed Trial 
242-12-233. 
The CHMP noted that a significant prolongation of the QTc interval is observed in the paediatric population 
aged between 6 and 17 years in trial 233. The maximal mean change from baseline (patients on OBR) for 
QTcF was 17.5 msec after 4 months of delamanid addition to OBR. Given the relatively higher dose 
administered in these paediatric patients compared to adult patients, a larger prolongating effect on the 
QT interval could be expected. In that respect the QT effect seems to be consistent with the observations 
in adult patients. There were no SAEs or any AEs of QT prolongation observed. However, it should be kept 
in mind that in trial 233 patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions or abnormalities in screening ECG 
(including QTcF > 450 msec in both males and females) were excluded. Additionally the concomitant use 
of delamanid and moxifloxacin or bedaquiline was excluded. 
Paraesthesia, Hypoaethesia, and Tremor 
There was a low occurrence of neurological symptoms in Trial 233. No SAEs were reported for 
paraesthesia, hypoaethesia, or tremor. Paraesthesia of mild intensity was present in 1 subject (7.7%) in 
Assessment report  
EMA/526836/2020 
Page 58/68 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Group 1 (ages 12 to 17 years) and resolved. No subjects reported hypoaesthesia or tremor. 
No patients reported paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia or tremor in trial 232. 
Anxiety, Depression, and Insomnia 
No SAEs were reported for anxiety, depression, or insomnia. Depression of mild intensity was experienced 
by 1 subject (7.7%) in Group 1 (ages 12 to 17 years) and resolved. Mild insomnia was also reported by 1 
subject (7.7%) in Group 2 (ages 6 to 11 years) and resolved. There were no reports of anxiety. 
One patient reported insomnia in trial 232. 
Gastrointestinal Disorders (Nausea, Vomiting, and Gastritis) 
There were no SAEs reported for nausea, vomiting, or gastritis. Vomiting was experienced by 3 subjects 
(23.1%) total; 2 subjects in Group 1 (ages 12 to 17 years), and 1 subject in Group 2 (6 to 11 years). All 
events were mild and resolved. There were no reports of nausea or gastritis. 
In study 232, 5/37 (13.5%) reported nausea, 9/37 (24.3%) vomiting and 1/37 (2.7%) gastritis. 
Tinnitus 
There was no incidence of tinnitus reported in Trial 242-12-233. 
Blurred Vision 
There was no incidence of blurred vision reported in Trial 242-12-233. 
Hypokalaemia 
Hypokalaemia occurred infrequently: 1 subject (7.7%) in Group 1 (ages 12 to 17 years) experienced an 
AE of mild hypokalaemia which resolved. No SAEs were reported. 
One patient in trial 232 reported hypokalaemia. The AE was mild. 
Liver Disorders 
There were no SAEs of liver disorders. One subject (7.7%) in Group 1 (ages 12 to 17 years) experienced 
a mild event of prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time which resolved. 
Cortisol Level Increase 
There were no events of cortisol level increased in Trial 242-12-233. 
Safety in special populations 
Trial 233 – Pregnancy 
One event of pregnancy was reported after the last dose of delamanid and before the last dose of OBR. 
The subject gave birth to a male newborn via vaginal delivery. No malformations were noted in the 
newborn. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No new data in the paediatric population 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In trial 233 there were no discontinuations from the trial due to adverse events.

Post marketing experience 
The safety profile of delamanid observed in the post-marketing use setting is in line with the overall 
safety profile of the product currently established and the safety profile of other OBR used concomitantly. 
From the cumulative post-marketing data, within the paediatric population (≤ 17 years of age) the 
reported AEs pertained to the SOCs of injury, poisoning and procedural complications (126 events); 
investigations (35 events); gastrointestinal disorders (25 events); nervous system (23 events); general 
disorders and administration site conditions (20 events); infections and infestations (15 events); 
metabolism and nutrition disorders (13 events); psychiatric disorders (11 events); blood and lymphatic 
system disorders (10 events); respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (10 events); cardiac 
disorders (6 events); skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (6 events); hepatobiliary disorders (5 
events); eye disorders, (4 events); musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (2 events); endocrine 
disorders (2 events); and vascular disorder (1 event). 
A review of cumulative paediatric data, including paediatric data analysed per important identified and 
potential risks, from all Otsuka safety data-base sources, does not support any increased risk in the 
paediatric population or varying safety profile from the safety profile of delamanid established in adults. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Trial 242-12-232 was a phase 1, open-label, multiple-dose, and age de-escalation trial that investigated 
the pharmacokinetics and the safety and tolerability of delamanid in 37 paediatric MDR-TB patients 
administered with food for 10 days to subjects ages birth to 17 years, inclusive, who were also on therapy 
with an optimised background regimen. 
Trial 242-12-233 (phase 2, open-label, multi-dose trial to assess the safety, tolerability, PK and efficacy 
of delamanid) is a 6-month extension to Trial 232. The trial has been completed and data analysed for 13 
patients aged 6-17 years and is still ongoing for paediatric population subset 0 to 5 years of age.  
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
The safety data from these trials are consistent with the known safety profile of delamanid in adult 
subjects and no new safety signals have been identified. 
Possibly IMP-related TEAEs occurring during trial 233 were reported for 2 subjects (15.4%) and 
comprised single events of arthralgia, headache, butterfly rash, and dizziness. All terms are listed in the 
published delamanid summary of product characteristics. 
Safety concerns associated with the use of delamanid in the paediatric population are aligned with the EU 
Risk Management Plan.  
In the adult population, QT prolongation is reported as a very common (≥ 1/10) adverse reaction 
potentially caused by delamanid. In adults QT prolongation seems to be related to increased 
concentrations of the metabolite DM-6705 that accumulates slowly over time to a maximum level after 2 
months of treatment. 
In Study 232 delamanid was used for 10 days and no meaningful clinical change from baseline was seen 
in ECG parameters. 
Only 13 children were included in trial 233, but there were several cases with increase in QTcB and QTcF. In 
trial 233 (paediatric patients 6-17 years of age), the maximal mean change from baseline (patient on OBR) 
for QTcF was 17.5 msec, observed after 4 months of delamanid treatment. This is without placebo 
Assessment report  
EMA/526836/2020 
Page 60/68 
 
 
  
  
correction. This is higher than the QTcF interval prolongation observed in adults: In trail 204 (adult 
population, 100 mg BID), the mean placebo corrected increase in QTcF was 12.1 msec at 2 months. 
The above data suggest that the relatively higher exposure in the paediatric population aged 6-17 years 
relative to the adult population dosed 100 mg delamanid BID, would result in an increased risk for QTcF 
interval prolongation. In that respect, based on the current limited data, the QT effect seems to be 
consistent with the observations in adults, but no firm conclusions can be drawn at present. 
There were no SAEs or any AEs of QT prolongation observed. However, it should be kept in mind that in 
trial 233 patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions or abnormalities in screening ECG (including QTcF > 
450 msec in both males and females) were excluded. Additionally the concomitant use of delamanid and 
moxifloxacin or bedaquiline was excluded. 
The currently proposed dose based on the Pop PK model is lower than the one used in study 233 for 
children aged 6-11 years and 12-17 years. The evaluation of the PK/PD relationship of delamanid and its 
metabolite DM-6705 plasma concentrations and change in QTc interval has not been conducted yet, as it 
is only planned after trial 233 has been completed. It is therefore hard to assess the potential for QTc 
interval prolongation (and its clinical consequences) without modelling.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety data from these trials are consistent with the known safety profile of delamanid in adult 
subjects and no new safety signals have been identified. 
2.6.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.7.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application.  
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: The PRAC 
considered that the risk management plan version 3.2 is not acceptable. RMP version 3.1 remains as the 
latest approved. 
The MAH chose to submit the updated RMP version 3.3 to address the outstanding RMP issues as part of 
ongoing EMEA/H/C/00255/X/0046G procedure; this procedure will also address the changes reviewed and 
agreed as part of the current variation. No revised RMP is therefore adopted as part of this procedure.  
2.8.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with 
the latest QRD template version 10.1 and the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) took the opportunity 
to make minor editorial changes. 
The MAH initially proposed to extend the indication to adolescents and children aged 6 years and older 
with a body weight of at least 30 kg. As it is not likely that an average 6-year old child weighs 30 kg, 
there is a discrepancy between the age and weight limits selected (i.e. 6 years and 30 kg) and the CHMP 
Assessment report  
EMA/526836/2020 
Page 61/68 
 
 
  
  
therefore agreed the following reworded indication: 
“Deltyba is indicated for use as part of an appropriate combination regimen for pulmonary multi-drug 
resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in adults, adolescents and children with a BW of at least 30 kg when an 
effective treatment regimen cannot otherwise be composed for reasons of resistance or tolerability (see 
sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).” 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and do 
not require user consultation with target patient groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
It is estimated that 3.6% of the tuberculosis (TB) cases worldwide are multidrug-resistant (MDR); ie, 
resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin. Childhood TB comprises approximately 10% to 15% of the global TB 
disease burden, with higher rates in developing countries. Based on estimates of total MDR-TB cases this 
translates to a minimum global estimate of approximately 40 000 paediatric cases of MDR-TB per year. 
Differences in the pathophysiology and clinical presentation of TB in children make diagnosis more 
challenging in children than in adults and definitions of latent infection and active disease are not as clear. 
Children are also at a much higher risk of progression to active disease than adults. 
Microbiological confirmation is often not available due to the paucibacillary nature of disease and the 
difficulty of specimen collection (especially sputum) in younger children. The diagnosis usually relies on 
nonspecific clinical and radiologic signs, as well as a history of exposure (ie, close contact with a TB case). 
Fever (possibly intermittent or low grade), weight loss or failure to thrive, and persistent cough for > 2 
weeks are the most important clinical signs for pulmonary TB. 
Children are diagnosed with either confirmed or presumed MDR-TB. Confirmed disease occurs when an 
organism is isolated from the child and is shown either genotypically or phenotypically to be resistant to 
isoniazid and rifampicin. Presumed disease occurs when TB is diagnosed in combination with either known 
contact with an MDR-TB case or after failure of appropriate first-line therapy when adherence has been 
verified. Incident cases of childhood TB reflect recent transmission, which implies that drug resistance 
patterns observed among paediatric TB cases reflect primary (transmitted) drug resistance within the 
community. 
If a child presenting with TB is a known contact of an adult with MDR pulmonary TB, the child is a 
probable MDR-TB case and should be managed accordingly. 
The EMA Addendum to the guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products indicated for treatment of 
bacterial infections to address the clinical development of new agents to treat pulmonary disease due to 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (EMA/CHMP/EWP/14377/2008 Rev. 1, 20 July 2017) gives the following 
recommendations on the paediatric population:

- The presentation and treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis is similar in adults and paediatric patients 
aged from approximately 10 years so that an extrapolation of safety and efficacy data obtained from 
adults is acceptable. 
- The presentation of clinical disease may be different in children aged less than approximately 10 years 
compared to adults but the response to treatment may be comparable at least from the age of five years 
upwards, supporting the possibility of extrapolating efficacy documented in adults (and possibly also 
adolescents if they are enrolled into the same trials as adults) to this age group. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Treatment of drug-resistant TB is long, expensive and associated with frequent adverse events. In 
children, treatment is further complicated by limited data on appropriate dosing and safety, and a lack of 
child-friendly formulations. New anti-TB drugs are urgently needed to improve treatment tolerability and 
outcome, particularly for MDR-TB cases with additional second-line drug resistance, for whom identifying 
at least four active drugs is difficult with the current armamentarium of drugs. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Trial 242-12-232 was a phase I, open-label, multiple-dose, and age de-escalation trial that investigated 
the pharmacokinetics and the safety and tolerability of delamanid in 37 paediatric MDR-TB patients 
administered with food for 10 days to subjects ages birth to 17 years, inclusive, who were also on therapy 
with an optimised background regimen. 
Trial 242-12-233 is a phase II, open-label, non-comparative, multi-dose trial to assess the safety, 
tolerability, PK and efficacy of delamanid and is a 6-month extension to Trial 232. Delamanid is added to 
OBR for 6 months. Patients safety, efficacy and PK are followed until 8 weeks after the last delamanid 
dose. There is a visit at 6 months after the last delamanid dose for safety and efficacy evaluation and an 
additional treatment outcome follow-up one year after this last follow-up visit. The trial has been 
completed and data analysed for age groups 6-17 years (13 patients) and is still ongoing for paediatric 
population subset 0 to 5 years of age. 
Six children aged 6–11 years were administered a 50 mg BID dosing regimen, and seven adolescents 
aged 12–17 years were administered a 100 mg BID dosing regimen. 
A population PK model was developed for delamanid in the paediatric population with the data collected in 
Trials 232 and 233 in order to define the dose in the paediatric patients. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Deltyba has a conditional marketing authorisation, obtained on 28 April 2014, for use as part of an 
appropriate combination regimen for pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in adult 
patients when an effective treatment regimen cannot otherwise be composed for reasons of resistance or 
tolerability. 
A population PK modelling approach was used to inform doses to be used in children of 6 to 17 years of 
age, assuming that similar PK exposure as in adults should lead to similar response to delamanid. The 
use of delamanid in addition to OBR in paediatric trial 233 resulted in a favourable treatment outcome in 
12 of the 13 subjects aged 6 to 17 years at 24 months; 7 of the 13 subjects (53.8%) were cured and 5 of 
the 13 subjects (38.5%) completed treatment. 
Simulation results are showing the following optimal doses:

- 
- 
- 
- 
20-30 kg: 35 mg BID (AUC ratio: 1.05) 
30-40 kg: 50 mg BID (AUC ratio: 1.1) 
40-50 kg: 50 mg BID (AUC ratio: 0.9) AND 100 mg BID (AUC ratio: 1.2) 
>50 kg: 100 mg BID (AUC ratio: 1.2) 
For the >50 kg group, the adult dose is proposed consistently with the fact the median weight in the 
adult study was 55 kg. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Pop PK 
A population PK modelling approach was used to inform doses to be used in children of 6 to 17 y, 
assuming that similar PK exposure as in adults should lead to similar response to delamanid. As stated 
above, this is presumed to be the case from the age of 5 years upwards.  
Additionally, it should be kept in mind that Deltyba obtained a conditional approval and that there is still 
uncertainty on the optimal dose in the adult population. 
As regards the Pop PK model development and evaluation, the methods used are overall considered state 
of the art. 
Results show overall good estimation of parameters. Only the intercompartmental clearance was 
estimated with a RSE of>50%. Results of graphical evaluation are also overall acceptable. Results of 
simulation results were shown for Cmaxs, AUCs and Cmins. Boxplots of distributions have been provided. 
PK data support dosing in children with a bodyweight < 30 kg, the existing film-coated tablets are not 
considered the optimal strength. Dosing proposals for these children will be included in the upcoming 2nd 
type II variation addressing the younger age groups. With this variation, the MAH will also submit an 
extension application to establish that delamanid dispersible tablets are more appropriate for 
administration in children with younger age and lower body weight. 
Most patients included in trial 233, certainly in group I and II, were Asian. In Pop PK study 256 was 
stated that exposure was higher in Asian people. This could have an impact on the observed PK data. The 
race effect could be driven by the difference in body size between Asian and non-Asian population, but 
this is not definitely established. The lack of significance of the race effect in the paediatric Pop PK model 
can be driven by the high rate of patients with race ‘unknown’ (10/25): these results are considered 
inconclusive. This should be further explored in the planned modelling exercise in the younger children, 
data permitting. 
Efficacy 
Based on the current conclusions of the Pop PK simulation, the proposed doses are lower than the ones 
used in trial 232 and 233 in children 6 to 17 years of age. 
Evaluation of efficacy is complicated by the more difficult diagnosis in younger patients. Especially for 
children below 10 years of age, the presentation of the clinical disease may be different in children than 
in adults and lesions are more likely to be of the extra-pulmonary TB type. Six out of 7 patients aged 12-
17 years had confirmed pulmonary MDR-TB, one probable pulmonary MDR-TB. In patient group II aged 6 
to 11 years, only 50% had confirmed MDR-TB and 50% had suspected MDR-TB; 2 patients had 
pulmonary TB, one extra-pulmonary TB and 3 both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB. 
The microbiological confirmation of the current episode of MDR-TB is based on the patient’s history and 
for some patients this was several months before screening for trial 232 (and 233) – up to 5 months for 
group I and almost 1 year for group II.

Determination of final treatment outcomes was not prescribed by the protocol; nevertheless, final 
outcomes were assessed by the treating clinician as per local and/or WHO guidance defining the 
categories ‘Cure’, ‘Treatment completed’ and ‘Treatment failed’. 
Efficacy of delamanid remains unclear in extra-pulmonary TB, especially in serious forms such as 
meningitis. Regarding TB meningitis, there are little data on the CNS penetration of delamanid. However, 
the MAH is only applying for an extension of the indication of pulmonary tuberculosis to paediatric 
patients from 6 to 17 years of age. 
Several subgroups of the paediatric population have not been studied: There were no patients with HIV, 
hepatitis B or C included in the paediatric trials. In addition, patients with severe malnutrition were 
excluded. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety data from these trials are consistent with the known safety profile of delamanid in adult 
subjects and no new safety signals have been identified. Possibly IMP-related TEAEs occurring during trial 
233 were reported for 2 subjects (15.4%) and comprised single events of arthralgia, headache, butterfly 
rash, and dizziness. All terms are listed in the published delamanid summary of product characteristics. 
In trial 233 (paediatric patients 6-17 years of age), there were several cases with increase in QTcB and 
QTcF, the maximal mean change from baseline for QTcF was 17.5 msec, observed after 4 months of 
delamanid treatment. This is higher than the QTcF interval prolongation observed in adults. There were 
no SAEs or any AEs of QT prolongation observed. 
In a concentration-corrected-QT interval modelling analysis, using the linear mixed effect model, the 
concentration of DM-6705 does have a significant impact on ΔQTc interval corrected for heart rate by 
Bazett’s formula (QTcB). The model-predicted that the upper bounds of the 90% CIs of ΔQTcB values 
were all less than 10 ms at the simulated Cmax of DM-6705 following the new recommended regimen. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Current exposure in the paediatric population is very low and prohibits drawing clear conclusions on the 
clinical safety of delamanid in this population. 
Several subgroups with a higher risk profile were not studied. There were no patients with HIV, hepatitis 
B or C included in the paediatric trials. Also, patients with severe malnutrition and underlying hearth 
disease were excluded. Concomitant use of delamanid and moxifloxacin or bedaquiline was excluded. 
The updated Pop PK/PD report (Otsuka Report No. 242-19-259) with the results from the concentration-
corrected-QT interval modelling analysis (PK/PD) has not been provided and hence detailed evaluation 
was not possible. This is planned to be submitted with completed Trial 242-12-233. A 6-7ms prolongation 
at therapeutic dose can definitely lead to >10ms at supratherapeutic concentrations, and therefore a QT 
effect cannot be ruled out. The currently provided data suggest that if 50 mg BID is used for paediatric 
patients weighing 30-50 kg and 100 mg BID for those above 50 kg, the model-predicted ΔQTc values will 
be in the same range as those observed in the adult population. 
3.6.  Effects Table 
Not applicable: A population PK modelling approach is used to inform doses to be used in children of 6 to 
17 years of age, assuming that similar PK exposure as in adults should lead to similar response to 
delamanid. Approval of the indication in children from 6 to 17 years of age is mainly based on the 
Assessment report  
EMA/526836/2020 
Page 65/68 
 
 
  
  
appropriateness of the age-specific dose regimens based on PK data and on an acceptable paediatric 
safety profile. 
3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The number of patients is too small to draw clear conclusions from the efficacy evaluation. 
Based on the assumption that the response to treatment may be comparable from the age of 5 years 
upwards, approval of the indication in children from 6 to 17 years of age is mainly based on the 
appropriateness of the age-specific dose regimens based on PK data and on an acceptable paediatric 
safety profile. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
A population PK modelling approach was used to inform doses to be used in children of 6 to 17 y, 
assuming that similar PK exposure as in adults should lead to similar response to delamanid. The 
proposed dosing regimen for children is based on body weight: 
-  
- 
- 
20-30 kg: 35 mg BID 
30-50 kg: 50 mg BID 
>50 kg: 100 mg BID 
For most patients this dosing regimen is lower than the dosing regimen used in the paediatric clinical 
trials 232 and 233. 
The safety data suggest that the relatively higher exposure in the paediatric population aged 6-17 years in 
trial 233 relative to the adult population dosed 100 mg delamanid BID, would result in an increased risk for 
QTcF interval prolongation. Based on a concentration-corrected-QT interval modelling analysis, the 
predicted upper bounds of the 90% CIs of ΔQTcB values were all less than 10 ms at the simulated Cmax of 
DM-6705 following the new recommended dose regimen. The currently provided data suggest that if 50 mg 
BID dose for paediatric patients weighing 30-50 kg and 100 mg BID for those above 50 kg are used, the 
model-predicted ΔQTc values will be in the same range as those observed in the adult population. A QT 
effect is not ruled out, but this risk would be acceptable, given the unmet need in the paediatric population, 
provided that appropriate precautions, specified in the SmPC, are followed. 
The safety risk in children from 6 to 17 years of age enrolled in the trials seems to be consistent with 
what was observed in adults. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Administration of 35 mg is not possible with the 50 mg film-coated tablets. The current extension of the 
indication is limited to adolescents and children with a body weight of at least 30 kg. The delamanid 
paediatric formulation, more appropriate for administration in children with younger age and lower body 
weight, will be introduced in a new extension application. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit-risk of Deltyba for use as part of an appropriate combination regimen for pulmonary 
multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in adolescents and children with a body weight of at least 30

kg when an effective treatment regimen cannot otherwise be composed for reasons of resistance or 
tolerability is positive.

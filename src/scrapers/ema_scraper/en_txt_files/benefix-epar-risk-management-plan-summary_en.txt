PART VI. SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Summary of risk management plan for BeneFIX (Nonacog alfa) 
This is a summary of the RMP for BeneFIX.  The RMP details important risks of BeneFIX, how 
these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about BeneFIX's risks 
and uncertainties (missing information). 
BeneFIX’s SmPC and its package leaflet give essential information to healthcare professionals 
and patients on how BeneFIX should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for BeneFIX should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of BeneFIX’s 
RMP. 
I. The Medicine and What It Is Used For 
BeneFIX is authorised for treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia B 
(congenital FIX deficiency) (see SmPC for the full indication).  It contains nonacog alfa as the 
active substance and it is given by intravenous infusion. 
Further information about the evaluation of BeneFIX’s benefits can be found in BeneFIX’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/benefix. 
II. Risks Associated With the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further Characterise 
the Risks 
Important risks of BeneFIX, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about BeneFIX's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.

In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
II.A. List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of BeneFIX are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of BeneFIX. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

II.B. Summary of Important Risks 
Table 2. 
Important Identified Risk: Inhibitor Development 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Inhibitor development has been reported in BeneFIX clinical trials and has also been 
reported in the postmarketing setting. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Several risk factors predispose a patient to inhibitor development.  Two (2) such 
factors are the presence of severe disease (FIX activity of <1 IU/dL), and specific 
gene mutations such as major derangements of the F9 gene due to large deletions, 
stop codons, and frame shift mutations. Other possible risk factors to be considered 
include the role of concomitant immune system challenges, and the type of factor 
concentrate used in treatment.

Table 3. 
Important Identified Risk: Allergic Reactions 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Allergic reactions have been reported in BeneFIX clinical trials and have also been 
reported in the postmarketing setting. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Allergic reactions have occurred in close temporal association with development of 
FIX inhibitor.  One (1) contributing factor is the nature of the gene mutation.  
Patients with large gene deletions are more susceptible to inhibitor development. 
Complete gene deletions confer the highest risk for anaphylaxis. 
PUPs with severe haemophilia B treated with any FIX replacement therapy may be 
more susceptible to develop an allergic reaction compared to PTPs.

Routine risk minimisation measures: 
SmPC Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, and 4.8

Table 4. 
Important Identified Risk: Thrombogenicity 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Thrombogenic events have been reported in BeneFIX clinical trials and has also 
been reported in the postmarketing setting.  Literature data. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
The use of FIX concentrates has historically been associated with the development of 
thromboembolic complications.  When administering this product to patients with 
liver disease, to patients post-operatively, to neonates, or to patients at risk of 
thrombotic phenomena or DIC, the benefit of treatment with BeneFIX should be 
weighed against the risk of these complications.

Important Potential Risk: Medication Errors/Product Confusion 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Medication errors have been reported for BeneFIX primarily in the postmarketing 
setting. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
 No clinically important sub-population differences in risk were identified.

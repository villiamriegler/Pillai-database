Tremelimumab AstraZeneca (tremelimumab) 
An overview of Tremelimumab AstraZeneca and why it is authorised in the 
EU 
What is Tremelimumab AstraZeneca and what is it used for? 
Tremelimumab AstraZeneca is a cancer medicine for treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that 
has metastasised (spread to other parts of the body) in adults who have not been treated before. It is 
given together with durvalumab (another cancer medicine) and platinum-based chemotherapy, and is 
used when the cancer has shown no mutations (changes) in the so-called EGFR and ALK genes.  
Tremelimumab AstraZeneca contains the active substance tremelimumab. 
How is Tremelimumab AstraZeneca used? 
Tremelimumab AstraZeneca can only be obtained with a prescription and treatment must be started 
and supervised by a doctor with experience in treating cancer.  
Tremelimumab AstraZeneca is given as an infusion (drip) into a vein which lasts about an hour, in 
combination with durvalumab and chemotherapy. Treatment consists of a maximum of 5 doses, but 
may be stopped permanently if the cancer worsens or if the patient gets severe side effects.  
For more information about using Tremelimumab AstraZeneca, see the package leaflet or contact your 
doctor or pharmacist. 
How does Tremelimumab AstraZeneca work? 
The active substance in Tremelimumab AstraZeneca, tremelimumab, is a monoclonal antibody (a type 
of protein). It is designed to attach to and block CTLA-4, a protein that controls the activity of T cells, 
which are part of the immune system (the body’s natural defences). By blocking CTLA-4, the medicine 
increases the number and activity of T cells, which can then kill cancer cells. This is expected to slow 
down the spread of the cancer. 
What benefits of Tremelimumab AstraZeneca have been shown in studies? 
In a main study in patients with metastatic NSCLC, 338 patients given Tremelimumab AstraZeneca in 
combination with durvalumab and chemotherapy lived on average for 14 months, compared with 12 
months for 337 patients given only chemotherapy. They also lived longer without their disease getting

worse: around 6 months on average, compared with 5 months for patients who only received 
chemotherapy. 
What are the risks associated with Tremelimumab AstraZeneca? 
The most common side effects with Tremelimumab AstraZeneca in combination with durvalumab and 
chemotherapy (which may affect more than 2 in 10 people) are anaemia (low levels of red blood cells), 
nausea (feeling sick), neutropenia (low levels of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell that fights 
infection), tiredness, rash, thrombocytopenia (low levels of platelets in the blood) and diarrhoea.  
The most common serious side effects (which may affect more than 2 in 10 people) are neutropenia 
and anaemia. Other serious side effects (which may affect up to 1 in 10 people) are pneumonia 
(infection of the lungs), thrombocytopenia, leucopenia (low levels of white blood cells), tiredness, 
neutropenia with fever, colitis (inflammation of the large intestine) and increased levels of liver 
enzymes and lipase (an enzyme that helps digest fat, mainly made in the pancreas). 
Tremelimumab AstraZeneca is commonly associated with side effects related to the activity of the 
immune system on body organs, such as immune-mediated hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid 
gland) and colitis. 
For the full list of side effects and restrictions of Tremelimumab AstraZeneca, see the package leaflet. 
Why is Tremelimumab AstraZeneca authorised in the EU? 
Tremelimumab AstraZeneca, when given in combination with durvalumab and chemotherapy, can 
prolong patients’ lives compared with chemotherapy only. Side effects of added Tremelimumab 
AstraZeneca, in particular concerning immune-mediated side effects, can be serious, and warrant 
caution when treating frail or elderly patients.  
The European Medicines Agency decided that Tremelimumab AstraZeneca’s benefits are greater than 
its risks and it can be authorised for use in the EU. 
What measures are being taken to ensure the safe and effective use of 
Tremelimumab AstraZeneca? 
The company that markets Tremelimumab AstraZeneca must provide healthcare professionals 
prescribing the medicine with educational materials on the side effects resulting from excessive activity 
of the immune system. Patients will also receive from their doctor an alert card summarising key 
safety information on the medicine. 
Recommendations and precautions to be followed by healthcare professionals and patients for the safe 
and effective use of Tremelimumab AstraZeneca have also been included in the summary of product 
characteristics and the package leaflet. 
As for all medicines, data on the use of Tremelimumab AstraZeneca are continuously monitored. 
Suspected side effects reported with Tremelimumab AstraZeneca are carefully evaluated and any 
necessary action taken to protect patients.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Ipilimumab (MDX-010, BMS-734016), a fully human anti-human CTLA-4 (CD152) monoclonal antibody 
of the IgG1-κ isotype, is an immunomodulatory agent that is being developed for use in the treatment 
of cancer. The proposed mechanism of action for ipilimumab is interference of the interaction of CTLA-
4, expressed on a subset of activated T cells, with B7 (CD80/CD86) molecules on professional antigen-
presenting cells. This results in T-cell potentiation due to blockade of the inhibitory modulation of T-cell 
activation promoted by the CTLA-4/B7 interaction. 
The resulting T-cell activation, proliferation, and lymphocyte infiltration into tumours, leads to tumour 
cell death. The mechanism of action of ipilimumab is indirect, through enhancing T-cell mediated

immune response. The commercial dosage form proposed for the European Union (EU) is a 5 mg/ml 
concentrate for solution for infusion. 
Ipilimumab was granted a marketing authorisation in the European Union (EU) on 13 July 2011 and is 
currently approved for the indication “treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in 
adults who have received prior therapy”.  
Ipilimumab is administered at a dose of 3 mg/kg for a maximum of 4 doses. 
The marketing authorisation was based on the results of the pivotal study MDX010-20 ipilimumab 
(3 mg/kg) where ipilimumab has shown a statistically significant improvement in OS compared to 
gp100 vaccine (experimental vaccine), when given as second line therapy of patients with metastatic 
melanoma with HLA-A0201 positive status. Median OS was 10.1 months with ipilimumab alone versus 
6.4 months with gp100 vaccine (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.51, 0.87, p=0.003). A significant increase in PFS 
was also observed (HR 0.64, median PFS 2.86 months with Ipilimumab and 2.76 months with gp100 
vaccine, p<0.001). BORR (PR+CR) and disease control rate was 10.9% and 28.5%, respectively. Long-
term survival data indicates that 54 of the 403 patients in the ipilimumab plus gp100 group, 24 of the 
137 patients in the ipilimumab monotherapy group, and 16 of the 136 patients in the gp100 
monotherapy group, remain alive for a minimum of 2 years. The positive efficacy results for ipilimumab 
of the MDX010-20 study were supported by high level results from study CA184024 in which an OS 
benefit was seen for previously untreated patients treated with ipilimumab (10 mg/kg) in combination 
with dacarbazine (DTIC) compared to patients treated with DTIC alone. 
In this application, the MAH applied to extension the indication of Yervoy to previously untreated adult 
patients advanced melanoma (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma at a proposed posology of 
3 mg/kg. 
Melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer. The incidence of melanoma varies between different 
European countries the estimated incidence is about 3.5 /100.000 men and 2.5/ 100.000 women per 
year. White populations have an approximately 10-fold greater risk of developing cutaneous melanoma 
than black, Asian or Hispanic populations (Goldstein AM, et al., Curr Opin Oncol. 1993; 5:258-363). 
Approximately half the incidence is in people between the age of 35 and 65 years, with a median age 
at diagnosis of 57 years. The last decades the incidence has been increased continuously.  The 
increase in incidence affect all ages. 
The prognosis of localized disease (thin lesions <1.0 mm without adverse prognostic features) is 
excellent, with greater than 90% survival when detected early and treated with adequate surgery. 
However, about 20% of the patients diagnosed with melanoma develop metastases. For these patients 
the prognosis is poor: the 5-year survival rate is lower than 15%; only 25.5.% of patients are alive at 
1 year.  Palliative treatment, consisting of systemic therapy, surgery and/or radiotherapy, is the only 
therapeutic option for patients with unresectable or metastatic disease. Complete resection of isolated 
metastases to one anatomic site (lung, gastrointestinal tract, bone or brain) may occasionally achieve 
long term survival. Systemic treatment may consist of chemotherapy, and/or immunotherapy. 
Palliative radiotherapy is indicated for symptomatic relief of metastases to brain, bones and viscera.  
Currently, only DTIC and vemurafenib are approved for systemic first line treatment of advanced 
melanoma. However, both options have their limitations and restrictions.  
DTIC may achieve objective response rates of about 20%, of which less than 5% is complete remission 
(Huncharek M. et al., Melanoma Res 2001; 11:75-81).  Responses are usually short, although, for a 
very limited number of patients long term survival has been reported.  
Vemurafenib is a low molecular weight, orally available, inhibitor of the activated form of the BRAF 
serine-threonine kinase enzyme. It is indicated for patients for the treatment of BRAF V600 mutation-

positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Consequently, for more than 50% of the patients with 
advanced melanoma vemurafenib is no treatment option. 
It is considered that still an unmet medical need exist for first line treatment of advanced melanoma.   
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
According to the CHMP guideline “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal 
Products for Human Use” (ref. EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00, dated 01 June 2006), ‘Vitamins, 
electrolytes, amino acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids are exempted because they are 
unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. Similarly, vaccines and herbal medicinal 
products are also exempted due to the nature of their constituents’. 
Ipilimumab is a natural substance (protein composed of natural amino acids), the use of which will not 
alter the concentration or distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, ipilimumab is 
not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
All studies with pharmacokinetic data for ipilimumab are summarized in Table 2. PK results from 
studies Medarex (MDX)-sponsored studies and Bristol-Myers Squibb (CA-studies)-sponsored studies 
CA184004, CA184007, CA184008, and CA184022 have been discussed in the reports of the initial 
marketing authosiation application (MAA) for Yervoy. This application included newly submitted PK 
data from phase 3 study CA184024 and from the drug-drug interaction study CA184078. 
The objective of the applicant was to provide clinical pharmacology data of ipilimumab to support of 
the treatment of advanced melanoma in previously untreated patients with this 3 mg/kg monotherapy, 
to overcome the lack of data at that dose from the provided phase 3 study which used a 10 mg/kg 
dose in combination with dacarbazine. Consequently, the applicant provided a population 
pharmacokinetics (popPK) analysis based on all CA-studies.

Study CA184078: interaction between ipilimumab and 
paclitaxel/carboplatin or between ipilimumab and dacarbazine 
Study CA184078 was a 3-arm, parallel, randomized, open-label phase 1 study of ipilimumab 
administered alone or in combination with chemotherapy in subjects with untreated advanced 
melanoma. 
Subjects were randomized (1:1:1) to one of the following 3 treatment arms: to receive ipilimumab 
alone or in combination with paclitaxel/carboplatin, or in combination with dacarbazine  during the 
Induction Phase: 
• Arm A: During the Induction Phase, each subject received paclitaxel/carboplatin (paclitaxel 175 
mg/m2 intravenously [IV] by a 3-hour infusion and carboplatin [AUC=6] IV by a 30-minute infusion) 
on Day 1 (Week 1 Day 1) and ipilimumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg IV administered on Day 3 (Week 1 
Day 3). Further doses of ipilimumab (Weeks 4, 7, and 10) and paclitaxel/carboplatin (Weeks 4, 7, 10, 
13, 16, 19, and 22) were administered every 3 weeks, with subjects receiving the ipilimumab infusion 
first, followed by the paclitaxel and then carboplatin infusions. A maximum of 8 doses of chemotherapy 
was permitted. 
• Arm B: During the Induction Phase, each subject received dacarbazine (dacarbazine 850 mg/m2 IV 
by a 1-hour infusion) on Day 1 (Week 1 Day 1) and ipilimumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg IV administered 
over 90 minutes on Day 3 (Week 1 Day 3). Further doses of ipilimumab (Weeks 4, 7, and 10) and 
dacarbazine (Weeks 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, and 22) were provided every 3 weeks, with subjects 
receiving the ipilimumab infusion first, followed by the dacarbazine infusion. A maximum of 8 doses of 
chemotherapy was permitted. 
• Arm C: During the Induction Phase, each subject received ipilimumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg IV 
administered over 90 minutes every 3 weeks for up to 4 doses (Weeks 1 [Week 1 Day 1], 4, 7, and 
10). 
In Arm A, PK samples to measure paclitaxel in plasma were collected up to 48 hours after the first 
dose of paclitaxel on Day 1 (without ipilimumab) and after the third dose at Week 7 (with ipilimumab). 
In Arm B, PK samples to measure dacarbazine and its active metabolite, 5- minoimidazole-4-
carboxamide (AIC), in plasma were collected up to 24 hours after the first dose of dacarbazine (before 
ipilimumab) and after the third dose at Week 7 (with ipilimumab). 
In all 3 arms, PK samples to assess the PK profile of ipilimumab at steady-state were collected after 
the third dose of ipilimumab (Week 7).  
Ipilimumab pharmacokinetics 
The PK parameters of ipilimumab are summarized in Table 3. Co-administration of chemotherapy 
concurrent with ipilimumab resulted in slight deceases in exposure, however the mean estimates of 
area under the curve (AUC), maximum observed concentration (Cmax), and half-life (T-HALF) values 
were comparable across the treatment arms. The mean systemic clearance (CL) and Vss values were 
similar between the 3 treatment arms.  
The geometric means for ipilimumab Cmax and AUC(0-21d) changed 0.982 and 0.917 fold, 
respectively, in the presence of dacarbazine. The 90% CIs for the geometric mean ratios were 
contained within 0.75 and 1.21. 
The geometric means for ipilimumab Cmax and AUC(0-21d) changed 0.934 and 0.868 fold, 
respectively, in the presence of paclitaxel/carboplatin. The 90% CIs for the geometric mean ratios 
were contained within 0.68 and 1.14.

Pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel with or without ipilimumab 
Pharmacokinetic parameters of paclitaxel with (day 43) or without (day 1) 10 mg/kg ipilimumab are 
summarized in Table 4. The geometric means for paclitaxel Cmax and AUC(INF) changed 0.963 and 
1.068 fold, respectively, in the presence of ipilimumab. All 90% CIs for the geometric mean ratios 
were contained within 0.79 and 1.20.

Pharmacokinetics of dacarbazine with or without ipilimumab 
Ipilimumab did not affect the pharmacokinetics of dacarbazine and its active metabolite AIC. The PK 
parameters are summarized in Table 5. The geometric means for dacarbazine Cmax and AUC(INF) 
changed 1.027 and 0.912 fold, respectively, in the presence of ipilimumab. Those for its metabolite,

CA184008 N=148 and CA184022 N=177) and one randomized phase 3 study in combination with 
dacarbazine (CA184024, N=240). Of these, 528 subjects received ipilimumab alone, while 257 
subjects received ipilimumab with dacarbazine. This analysis included 348 previously untreated and 
437 previously treated advanced melanoma subjects. 
In most studies, PK samples were collected on Day 1 and Day 43 (3rd dose), preinfusion and after 90-
minute infusion. Three additional samples were taken between Day 3-7 (post-dose) after week 7 dose, 
Day 10-15 (post-dose) after week 7 dose and the predose sample on Day 64. In study CA184078 PK

drug interaction study, samples were collected on Day 1 and Day 43, preinfusion and 1.5, 3, 5, 9, 24, 
and 48 hours post-start of infusion. 
Ipilimumab PK was described with a linear two-compartment model with zero-order IV infusion 
parameterized in terms of clearance (CL), volume of central compartment (VC), inter-compartmental 
clearance (Q), and volume of peripheral compartment (VP).  
PopPK parameters were very similar to the popPK model in the initial application. Like previous, 
bodyweight was a significant co-variate for both CL and VC and ipilimumab CL increased with higher 
LDH baseline levels. In the original application, it was discussed that no dose adjustments based on 
baseline LDH and bodyweight are necessary as ipilimumab is being dosed per bodyweight.  
Concomitant dacarbazine, prior systemic anti-cancer therapy, and immunogenicity status were not 
retained in the final model because they were found not to clinically relevant predictors of ipilimumab 
PK. 
Ipilimumab concentration-time data were described with a linear, two-compartment, zero-order IV-
infusion model with first-order elimination. Dose proportionality in the PK of ipilimumab was 
investigated in a previous report and ipilimumab was found to exhibit dose proportional PK. This was 
again confirmed by the current popPK model: Cl, Vss and elimination half-life were independent of 
dose (Table 6). The estimated mean (CV%) of CL, VSS, and,T1/2β are 0.0168 L/h (38.1%), 7.47 L 
(10.1%), and 15.4 days (34.4%). The individual PK parameter estimates for the 3 and 10 mg/kg dose 
are obtained from final popPK model have been summarized in Table 6.

4 subjects with severe renal impairment (GFR<30 ml/min) were included. Like in the popPK model in 
the original application, the CL of ipilimumab is similar across the renal function groups. Median CL of 
ipilimumab for subjects with normal renal function, mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment is 
0.017, 0.015, 0.015, and 0.014 L/hr, respectively. The results confirm that ipilimumab can be dosed 
without regard to renal function.

Hepatic impairment 
The bulk of the PK data came from subjects with normal hepatic function (708 subjects including a 
subject whose classification was missing and was reclassified as normal) and those with mild hepatic 
impairment (76 subjects). Mild hepatic impairment was defined as bilirubin between 1 and 1.5x ULN or 
AST>ULN. The median values of CL for the normal and mild hepatic function categories are 0.015, and 
0.018 L/hr, respectively. Thus, mild hepatic impairment has no effect on ipilimumab CL. 
Previously treated and untreated advanced melanoma 
This analysis included 348 previously untreated and 437 previously treated advanced melanoma 
subjects. The final popPK model was used to generate exposure metrics (Cminss) using data from 0.3, 
3 and 10 mg/kg ipilimumab dosing. Ipilimumab Cminss was comparable in previously treated or 
untreated melanoma subjects (data not shown). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Data on T-cell activation from the newly and previously submitted studies was also discussed in this 
application.  
The MAH also submitted exposure-OS analysis from the phase 3 study CA184024 for ipilimumab 
10 mg/kg with dacarbazine (DTIC) compared with DTIC alone in untreated patients and exposure-
safety analysis from all CA studies will be discussed in the pharmacology section of the report. 
Biomarker analysis: Activation of T-cells  
CTLA-4, the target of ipilimumab, is expressed only on T cells. Previously, activation of T-cells at the 
3 mg/kg dose was studied in previously treated or untreated subjects in the Phase 2 CA184004 trial. 
Treatment with ipilimumab resulted in an increase in the frequency of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-
cells (defined as expression of HLA-DR). Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg induces a sustained increase from 
baseline in frequency of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells for both the untreated and previously 
treated subjects (Table 7).  
Table 7 - Frequencies of T Cell Sub-Populations after Treatment with 3 mg/kg Ipilimumab 
by Prior Therapy study CA184004 (N=14 untreated, N=26 previously treated) 
Ipilimumab 10 mg/kg induced an increase in frequency of activated HLA-DR+ CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells 
when administered as monotherapy or in combination with DTIC or paclitaxel/carboplatin (data not 
shown). 
Previously, ipilimumab monotherapy has been shown to result in an increase from baseline in mean 
absolute lymphocyte count (ALC). Also in the Phase 3 study (CA184024), mean ALC increased over 
time after initiation of treatment in the 10 mg/kg ipilimumab plus DTIC group, but not in the DTIC 
monotherapy group. The increase in ALC by ipilimumab was not affected by DTIC in study CA185078.

Exposure-Efficacy Response Analysis: Overall Survival 
CA184024 was a large, double-blind, multi-center Phase 3 study in previously untreated advanced 
melanoma subjects (see Clinical Efficacy for details on methodology).  
Exposure-response (E-R) analyses were performed to characterize the relationship between ipilimumab 
steady-state trough concentration (Cminss) and select clinical endpoints. 
The exposure-overall survival (OS) relationship was analysed with the Cox proportional hazard (CPH) 
model. Higher ipilimumab Cminss increased survival. The relative hazard ratio for a subject who had 
median Cminss value of 49.9 µg/mL was 0.73 relative to a subject in the placebo (placebo plus 
dacarbazine) group. Metastatic status, LDH, and ECOG status were determined to be potentially 
clinically relevant predictors of OS. The magnitude of covariate effects were assessed by the ratio of 
parameter estimates relative to typical parameter values for a reference subject. Subjects with the 
worst metastatic status (M1C) had 2.24-fold higher risk of death compared to subjects with milder 
metastatic status (M0). A poor ECOG status (ECOG =1) subject had higher risk (1.71-fold) than a 
normal ECOG status subject. Subjects with elevated LDH status (> ULN) were at a higher risk (2.22 
times) when compared with subjects who had normal LDH status. 
The distribution of OS (time-to-death) relative to the first dose was characterized using the Kaplan-
Meier (KM) analysis. KM analysis for OS grouped by ipilimumab exposure (using Cminss tertiles) is 
presented graphically in Figure 1. The Cminss tertiles were defined as the following: 
• 1st Cminss tertile (0 < Cminss ≤ 42.11 mcg/mL), 
• 2nd Cminss tertile (42.11 < Cminss ≤ 59.94 mcg/mL), and 
• 3rd Cminss tertile (Cminss > 59.94 mcg/mL). 
The ipilimumab Cminss values for dacarbazine + placebo group were assumed to be zero. Based on 
the result from KM analysis using ipilimumab exposure (Figure 1) the ris 
k of death tended to decrease with increasing Cminss.

Exposure-Safety Response Analyses: immune related Adverse Event  
Data from all CA studies were included to evaluate ipilimumab exposure -  immune related Adverse 
Event (irAE) relationship. The relationship between Cminss and the probability of having Grade 2+ and 
Grade 3+ irAEs was characterized with data from 1036 subjects in one Phase 1 study (CA184078),four 
Phase 2 studies (CA184004, CA184007, CA184008, and CA184022) and one Phase 3 study 
(CA184024). Of these, 528 subjects received ipilimumab alone, while 257 subjects received ipilimumab 
with DTIC and 251 subjects administered DTIC + placebo. Immune-related AEs were selected as the 
safety endpoint for the E-R analysis because they are likely causally related to drug exposure and the 
mechanism of action of ipilimumab, and were the most frequently reported drug-related AEs. An 
Emax-based proportional odds model was developed to describe the probability of experiencing a worst 
irAE of grade 2 or greater (Grade ≥ 2), and grade 3 or greater (Grade ≥ 3). A separate model was 
developed for each of gastrointestinal irAEs, hepatobiliary irAEs, skin irAEs, and any occurrence of 
gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, skin, endocrine, neurologic, or “other” irAEs (in any organ). 
The E-R analyses indicated that the probability of experiencing irAE Grade ≥ 2 and Grade ≥ 3 
increased with increasing Cminss (Table 8). In addition to Cminss, the following covariates were also 
assessed as potential predictors of irAE: age, weight, baseline LDH, baseline ALC, concomitant DTIC, 
gender, previous treatment status, ECOG status, and metastatic stage, and the presence of liver 
metastases (in the hepatobiliary irAE model).

Concomitant DTIC was retained as a covariate in the Final GI and hepatobiliary irAE models. Co-
administration of DTIC with ipilimumab was associated with a markedly increased risk of having 
hepatobiliary irAEs (OR: 9.3) but a decreased risk of GI irAEs (OR: 0.57). No other covariates were 
found to have explanatory value. Liver metastases was evaluated as a potential explanatory factor for 
hepatobiliary irAEs, however, it was not associated with high incidence of Grade 3+ irAEs.20 No 
covariate was retained in the Final E-R model for skin irAEs. 
The only factor retained in the Final E-R model for any irAE (other than Cminss) was previous 
treatment status. However, the effect of DTIC and previous treatment status might be confounded as 
most previously untreated subjects received DTIC, and therefore the selection of this factor may be an 
artifact of the potential confounding between these two estimated effects. Specifically, the apparent 
increase in the risk of irAEs in previously untreated patients may in fact be due to the increased risk of 
the hepatobiliary component of any irAEs, which has been shown to be markedly higher (OR: 9.3) for 
patients who received concomitant DTIC.

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg demonstrated a prolonged and significant OS benefit in the randomized Phase 3 
study MDX010-20 in previously treated melanoma patients.  
In study CA184024 ipilimumab was given at a 10 mg/kg dose+DTIC. PK and exposure-response 
analysis from phase 3 study CA184024 have been submitted to support the rationale for the extension 
of the indication to be approved for ipilimumab as monotherapy at a 3 mg/kg dose.  
PK of ipilimumab was similar in previously treated and untreated, advanced melanoma. Two 
ipilimumab target concentrations were set: Cminss 3 µg/ml to block CD86 and 20 µg/ml to block CD86 
and CD80. Ninety nine percent of the subjects in the 3 mg/kg dose exceeded the 3 µ/mL ipilimumab 
target trough concentration, however, less than 50% of the subjects exceeded the 20 µg/ml 
ipilimumab target trough concentration. Ipilimumab increased the percentage of activated HLA-DR+ 
CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells in both previously treated and previously untreated subjects.   
With respect to exposure-response analyses of the phase 3 study CA184024 at a 10 mg/kg 
dose+DTIC, metastatic status, LDH, and ECOG status were clinically relevant predictors of OS. 
Subjects with the worst metastatic status (M1C), poor ECOG status (ECOG =1) and subjects with 
elevated LDH status (> ULN) had a higher risk of death. The Cox proportional hazard model indicated 
that higher ipilimumab Cminss increased probability of survival. The relative hazard ratio for a subject 
who had median Cminss value of 49.9 µg/mL was 0.73 relative to a subject in the placebo arm 
(placebo plus DTIC). Also Kaplan Meier estimates indicated a better OS with higher ipilimumab Cminss. 
However, only subjects with ipilimumab Cminss concentrations >42 µg/ml appeared to have a higher 
OS over dacarbazine alone. Based on PK data submitted in the original application (median Cminss 
ipilimumab for 3 mg/kg was 17.9 µg/ml and 95% percentile was 38.9 µg/ml), it is clear that such high 
ipilimumab Cminss concentrations are not be reached with a 3 mg/kg ipilimumab dose. The exposure 
efficacy response analysis suggested a lower efficacy (lower OS) for the 3 mg/kg as compared to the 
10 mg/kg ipilimumab treatment. However, the results are difficult to interpret, because the difference 
can also be explained by an imbalance in prognostic factors in the patient groups with a relatively low 
plasma concentration. Also, the comparison may be biased as the groups being compared are based on 
post-baseline criteria and patients with poorer prognosis are likely to have lower exposure. 
The results from the Cox proportional hazard analysis to investigate the exposure - OS relationship 
could also not exclude that the effect of ipilimumab may be reduced in patients receiving concomitant 
DTIC. A possible negative interaction for concomitant use of ipilimumab and DTIC is of less concern at 
this time, because the MAH applies for an indication for ipilimumab monotherapy. 
The probability of Grade 2+ (Gr2+) and Grade 3+ (Gr3+) any irAEs was indeed lower at 3 mg/kg 
monotherapy compared to 10 mg/kg. However, the probability of Gr2+ and Gr3+ any irAE appeared to 
be higher in previously untreated compared to previously treated patients. This effect of previous 
treatment status might be confounded as most previously untreated subjects received ipilimumab in 
combination with DTIC.  
This application also included results from a drug-interaction study of ipilimumab administered alone 
and in combination with chemotherapy (dacarbazine or paclitaxel/carboplatin) evaluating interaction 
with CYP isozymes (particularly CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4) in patients with treatment-
naive advanced melanoma. No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic drug drug interaction and this is 
reflected in section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
Additional information has also been included in the SmPC with regards to patients with renal and 
hepatic impairment further to the additional population PK data submitted in this application.

2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology data submitted in this application were considered adequate to support the 
proposed indication. Further discussion on the posology recommendation is addressed in the efficacy 
and safety sections. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No dose-response study was submitted.  
The primary evidence of efficacy and safety of 10 mg/kg ipilimumab in untreated advanced melanoma 
is based on study CA184024. 
Four of the clinical studies (MDX010-20, MDX010-08, CA184022 and CA 184004) evaluated the 
recommended dose of 3 mg/kg administered once every 3 weeks (q3w) for 4 doses, were submitted 
and assessed during the initial MA. To support the same posology recommendation for the currently 
applied indication (treatment of previously untreated melanoma patients), data were analyzed by prior 
treatment (previously treated vs previously untreated, chemotherapy naïve vs chemotherapy 
pretreated) and is further discussed in the following section.

or active ipilimumab continued dosing in 12-week intervals (maintenance phase). Ipilimumab 
administration continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent. 
Dacarbazine (DTIC) 
All patients in the induction phase received open-label DTIC at 850 mg/m2 IV over 30 to 60 minutes 
every 3 weeks up to Week 22, until PD on or after Week 12, unacceptable toxicity associated with 
DTIC or ipilimumab/placebo, discontinuation of ipilimumab, or withdrawal from treatment or the study 
itself. Whenever applicable (Weeks 1, 4, 7 and 10), DTIC was to be administered following 
ipilimumab/placebo, on the same day.  
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to compare overall survival (OS) in patients with previously 
untreated stage IIIc, N3 (unresectable) or Stage IV melanoma receiving dacarbazine plus 10 mg/kg 
ipilimumab vs dacabazine with placebo.  
Secondary objectives included the comparison between the two arms of progression-free survival 
(PFS), disease control rate (proportion with best overall response of complete response [CR] or partial 
response [PR] or stable disease [SD]), the estimate of survival rates at 1 year, 18 months and 2 years 
for each treatment arm; the estimates of the duration of response, time to response, health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL) for each treatment arm. In addition, serum samples were to be obtained for 
population pharmacokinetics (PK). 
Following database lock for the main analysis, the study was amended and will continue in an 
Extension Phase, the objectives of which are to estimate survival rates at 3, 4, and 5 years for 
ipilimumab and to evaluate the safety profile of ipilimumab for patients in the Extension Phase. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Overall Survival (OS) was defined for each patient as the time between randomization date and death. 
If a patient was still alive, the patient was censored at the last known alive date 
Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time between randomization and the date of 
progression or death, which ever occurred first. A patient who died without reported prior progression 
was considered to have progressed on the date of death. For those who remained alive and did not 
progress, PFS was censored on the date of last evaluable TA, but if they had no recorded post-baseline 
TA, they were censored at the day of randomization. Progression prior to Week 12 did not constitute a 
PFS event if the patient showed a subsequent assessment of SD, PR or CR at week 12. Such patients 
were, however, counted progressors if they experienced progression at a visit subsequent to week 12. 
For patients who had surgical resection, only pre-surgical |TAs conducted on or prior to the date of 
surgery were considered in the determination of PFS. The primary assessment of PFS was based on 
review of lesion imaging data by the independent review committee (IRC). 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints were: Survival rate, PFS rate at week 12, tumour response (CR, 
PR, SD or PD) based on assessment according to modified WHO criteria (mWHO), disease control rate 
defined as the number of patients whose BOR was PR, CR or SD, divided by the total number of 
randomized patients, best overall response rate defined as the number of patients whose BOR was PR 
or CR, divided by the total number of randomized patients, duration of response, time to response, 
duration of stable disease, brain metastasis-free status, immune-related response and Health-related 
Quality of Life (questionnaire C-30).

Progression-free survival and tumor response were evaluated by an IRC and investigators based on 
modified World Health Organization (mWHO) criteria. The assessment of the IRC was considered 
primary over that of the investigators. Response was also assessed using prespecified immune-related 
(ir) Response criteria that were developed, using mWHO as a foundation, to systematically categorize 
ipilimumab clinical activity before and after progression by mWHO. Response using both mWHO and 
irResponse criteria was determined by the IRC. 
Sample size 
A total of 416 events from a sample size of 500 patients ensured 90% power to detect (using a log-
rank test at the two sided 0.05 significance level) an improvement in PFS equivalent to a HR of 0.727. 
The study similarly had 90% power to detect (also using a log-rank test at the two-side 0.05 
significance level) an improvement in OS, equivalent to a HR of 0.727 (corresponding to an increase 
from 8 to 11 months in median OS).  
Analyses of baseline characteristics and efficacy endpoints were based on all randomized patients and 
were performed using the treatment group as randomized, i.e., on an intent-to treat (ITT) basis. 
The safety population is all treated patients who received at least 1 dose of ipilimumab or placebo 
and/or DTIC.  
Randomisation 
A centralized randomization scheme was used to assign patients in a 1:1 ratio to the DTIC plus 
ipilimumab or DTIC plus placebo groups. The randomization was stratified to: 1) baseline M stage (M0 
vs M1a vs M1b vs M1c), 2) ECOG performance status (0 vs 1) as determined at randomization, and 3) 
study site. 
Blinding (masking) 
The sponsor, patient, and site staff were blinded with respect to the patient’s treatment assignment. 
Local pharmacists and the CRO pharmacy monitors were unblinded. An independent Data Monitoring 
Committee had the possibility to access unblinded data in order to enable review of emerging safety 
data. In the event of a medical emergency or pregnancy in an individual patient, the treating physician 
could be unblinded if knowledge of the investigational product was critical to the patients management.  
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy analysis was a log-rank test, stratified by baseline M-stage (M0 vs. M1a vs. M1b 
vs. M1c) and ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1) as defined at the time of randomization, to compare 
OS between treatment groups. A two-sided alpha of 0.05 was used. The HR of DTIC plus 10 mg/kg 
ipilimumab to DTIC with placebo and the corresponding two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) were 
estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model, stratified by baseline M-stage (M0 vs. M1a vs. M1b 
vs. M1c) and ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1) as defined at the time of randomization, and with 
treatment as the single covariate. 
For the secondary efficacy analyses, survival rates at 1 year, at 18 months, at 2 years (and at 3 years) 
were calculated for each treatment group using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method. Corresponding 
two-sided 95% bootstrap CIs were calculated. Hierarchical tests were performed to compare the 
following secondary endpoints between treatment groups, with the order reflecting the hierarchy after 
the primary OS analysis: IRC-determined PFS, disease control rate and BORR. The comparison of IRC-
determined PFS between the treatment groups was conducted in a similar fashion to that for OS

described above. For the comparisons of BORR and disease control rate between treatment groups, a 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test with an associated odds ratio estimate and exact 95% CI, 
stratified by the factors noted above, was used. The duration of response in subjects with a confirmed 
response of CR or PR, estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method, was plotted. The time to 
response in subjects with a BOR of CR or PR was summarized by treatment group using descriptive 
statistics.

Recruitment 
First Subject First Visit: 8 August 2006  
Last Subject Last Visit for the Primary Endpoint: 7 February 2011 
Conduct of the study 
In light of Phase 2 data that suggested that OS was the better endpoint to characterize efficacy, the 
primary endpoint of the study was changed from PFS to OS after a discussion and approval by the US 
Food and Drug Administration in October 2008. No changes to the statistical considerations were 
necessary as the study was already fully powered to assess OS. 
Baseline data 
Baseline characteristics are presented in Table 9. 
Most patients (>98%) had normal WBC, ANC, and platelet results at baseline. Haemoglobin was 
normal in 77.9% of the patients, with Grade 2 abnormalities reported in 2.8% of the patients. Absolute 
lymphocyte count was normal in 58.4% of the patients, with Grade 2 and 3 abnormalities reported in 
4.6% and 0.4% of patients respectively. No differences between treatment groups were noted.   
Most patients (>84%) had normal ALT, AST, ALP and bilirubin results at baseline. No differences 
between treatment groups were noted. 
Most patients had normal pancreatic (>92%) and renal (>97%) function at baseline; no differences 
between treatment groups were noted. 
The median time from initial pathological diagnosis of malignant melanoma to first dose of study 
therapy was 20.0 months.

The frequency of prior systemic was balanced between treatment groups (26.4% and 27% in 
ipilimumab+ DTIC group and DTIC monotherapy group, respectively). A total of 26.7% of patients 
received prior systemic therapy, nearly all of whom received a total of 1 regimen. The most common 
adjuvant therapies were interferon-containing regimens (114/133 patients). The most common reason 
for discontinuing prior therapy was disease progression (55 patients), followed by treatment 
completion (37 patients). 
Numbers analysed 
A total of 502 subjects were randomized (250 to ipilimumab plus DTIC and 252 to DTIC monotherapy); 
498 subjects were treated (247 to ipilimumab plus DTIC and 251 to DTIC monotherapy). Two subjects 
in the DTIC monotherapy group each erroneously received 1 dose of active ipilimumab instead of 
ipilimumab placebo. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Overall survival 
The median OS was 11.2 months (95% CI; 9.4, 13.6) in the ipilimumab plus DTIC group and 9.1 
months (95% CI: 7.8, 10.5) in the DTIC monotherapy group. The HR for comparison of OS between 
the groups was 0.72 (95%CI; 0.59, 0.87; p=0.0009), indicating a 28% risk reduction in OS for the 
ipilimumab plus DTIC group compared with the DTIC monotherapy group. 
Overall survival for patients with disease control (patients with CR/PR/SD) was 28.7 months (95% CI: 
23.8, ---) and 19.8 months (95% CI: 14.6, 28.2) in the ipilimumab plus DTIC and DTIC monotherapy 
groups respectively.

Figure 2 - Overall Survival - Randomized Subjects 
The survival rate by timepoints were consistently higher in the ipilimumab plus DTIC group than in the 
DTIC group (Table 10).

(1) 2-sided confidence interval calculated using the bootstrap method, based on Kaplan-Meier estimation 
In each treatment group, the median OS was longer for those patients who received 4 induction doses 
of ipilimumab/placebo compared to those who received fewer doses, based on landmark analysis, 
which excluded patients who died (or who were censored) before the scheduled 4th induction dose. 
This explains the initial delay (up to Week 10) in the Kaplan-Meier plots before any deaths are 
observed.

In the DTIC monotherapy group, the median OS for patients who received 4 induction doses was 11.8 
months (95% CI: 10.5m 13.9), compared to 5.3 months (95% CI: 3.9, 6.3) for those who received < 
4 doses, and 5.4 (95% CI: 4.1, 8.3) for those who received 3 doses.

The assessment of progression was based on the IRC database which was finalized (after at least 416 
patients had progressed or died, as per original sizing assumptions) 15 months prior to the main 
database lock and are also presented in the figure below. Hence, the proportion of censored patients 
before 4 years in the PFS analysis is higher than in the OS analysis.

Figure 4 - Progression-free Survival by IRC - Randomized Subjects 
Tumour response assessments using irRC criteria 
The irRC are a refinement of the mWHO criteria to systematically capture tumor response in patients 
on immunotherapy. The irRC were created due to the distinct patterns of the clinical responses 
observed in patients treated with agents such as ipilimumab, patterns which exist in addition to 
conventional response patterns and are distinct from those seen in patients on chemotherapy. 
Results of the irRC are in line with the results of the conventional methods.  
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup comparisons for OS were performed across the following pre-specified categories: M-stage, 
baseline LDH, age, female age, ECOG status, prior adjuvant tratement, race,and gender. M-stage and 
baseline LDH represent prognostic factors associated with poor clinical outcome in late –stage 
melanoma.  
Results from most subgroup analyses demonstrated a consistent pattern with HRs favouring the 
ipilimumab plus DTIC group relative to the DTIC monotherapy group. However, for women above 50 
years of age (HR 1.03), the data supporting an OS benefit of ipilimumab plus DTIC treatment were 
limited. The efficacy of ipilimumab plus DTIC for women above 50 years of age is therefore uncertain.

Figure 5 - Overall Survival Hazard Ratio and 95% Confidence Interval for Subgroup Analyses 
With regards to PFS, results from pre-specified subgroup analyses demonstrated a consistent pattern 
with HRs favoring the ipilimumab plus DTIC group relative to the TIC monotherapy group with the 
exception of baseline M1a (HR 1.04). 
Results from prespecified subgroup analyses using mWHO criteria indicate responders in all subgroups, 
confirming clinical activity in all subgroups. The analyses demonstrated a consistent pattern with 
BORRs and DCRs numerically superior in the ipilimumab plus DTIC group relative to the DTIC 
monotherapy group in most case.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) and 
supportive studies 
Studies with ipilimumab were conducted using the 3 and/or 10 mg/kg posology, and are summarised 
in Table 1. 
In order to support the proposed 3 mg/kg posology recommendation, the MAH discussed these studies 
results and provided pooled analysis and comparison of results with reported with 3 mg/kg in 
previously treated vs previously untreated patients and of results in 3 mg/kg versus 10 mg/kg. 
Comparison by prior therapy 
For the efficacy studies submitted the OS after ipilimumab treatment for treatment naïve patients was 
compared to previously treated patients.

Assessment report

All randomized patients in the previously treated subgroups had received prior systemic therapies and 
many had received prior immunotherapies.  
In each of the studies (MDX010-20, MDX010-08 and CA184004/022), nearly all (>95%) randomized 
patients were treated with ipilimumab (alone or in combination with gp100 or DTIC). All treated 
patients were off treatment at the time of the analysis. 
Although the total number of patients within each study is limited, the baseline demographics and 
patient characteristics were generally similar between previously untreated and previously treated 
patients. 
Within each study, previously untreated and previously treated patients each received a median of 4 
doses, with the exception of previously treated patients in MDX010-08 (median of 3 doses in the 
monotherapy group and 3.5 doses in the ipilimumab +DTIC group). 
As indicated in the table below, results of median OS for previously treated patients were similar 
across studies. Results of median OS and estimated 1-year survival rates for previously untreated 
patients were similar to or numerically higher than those in previously treated patients in the MDX010-
20 study. 
Table 13 – OS by Prior Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy - Randomized Subjects 
With some Phase 2 studies having only a few patients still at risk for death beyond 18 months (e.g., 
MDX010-08), the 2 year survival estimates for each study alone should be interpreted with caution.  
Overall survival by Prior therapy- MDX010-20 
In the MDX010-20, OS benefit was observed regardless of the number of or type of prior anti-cancer 
systemic treatment. Specifically, OS benefit was observed for patients who did or did not have prior 
DTIC or non-DTIC chemotherapy or prior immunotherapy and for patients who had 1 or ≥2 prior line 
of therapy. 
The treatment effect in favor of the 3 mg/kg ipilimumab group was observed across all prior therapy 
subgroups: in all cases, the 95% CI of HR estimates in all subgroups included in the HR estimate for 
the overall (intent-to-treat [ITT]) population (HR=0.66; 95% CI: 0.51-0.87). These results 
demonstrate that the performance of ipilimumab within these subgroups is favorable and thus 
consistent with the survival advantage demonstrated for the overall study population.

Similar results were observed favoring in the ipilimumab 3 mg/kg + gp100 group vs the control group, 
where the 95% CI of HR estimates in all subgroups included the HR estimate for the overall (ITT) 
population (HR=0.68; 95% CI : 0.55-0.85). 
Pooled OS analysis for 3 mg/kg ipilimumab monotherapy  
OS analysis of data from the ipilimumab monotherapy arms of MDX010-20, the pooled data of 
CA184004/022, and all pooled data provided an overall survival of about 9 months after initiation of 
the studies, providing a consistent result regarding OS after 3 mg/kg ipilimumab monotherapy in 
patients with advanced melanoma (data not shown).  
Comparison of survival in the pooled group of 35 previously untreated patients vs the pooled group of 
254 previously treated patients are presented in the table and figure below.

The MAH also provided additional comparisons including results from two retrospective observational 
studies (CA184332 and CA184338) which included previously untreated patients with advanced 
melanoma who were treated with 3 mg/kg ipilimumab. 
Although DTIC has never demonstrated an OS benefit, this medicine has historically been used as the 
reference arm in randomized melanoma trials. Based on the 5 most recent trials in previously 
untreated, advanced melanoma, a median OS of approximately 9 months and estimated 1-year OS 
rate of approximately 36% represents an appropriate historical benchmark for DTIC monotherapy. The 
median OS for DTIC monotherapy as reported in several previously published studies was between the 
5.6 and 9.4 months (Patel et al., Eu J Cancer 2011, Middleton et al., J Clin Oncol 2000, Chapman et 
al., J Clin Onclol 1999, Avril et al., J Clin Oncol 2004). 
A number of historical comparisons were provided. Key demographic and other baseline characteristics 
of the concerned studies are summarised in the table below.

(CA184338) and for the pooled chemotherapy-naive patients, who received 3 mg/kg ipilimumab, 
overlap and always remain above the Kaplan-Meier OS curve for DTIC monotherapy (CA184024). The 
Kaplan-Meier OS curve for the 10 mg/kg ipilimumab + DTIC is provided as reference and appears to 
be similar to that of the 3 mg/kg ipilimumab populations.

studies, the 2 year OS rates were similar despite different eligibility (treatment naïve or pre-treated) 
and different regimens (3mg/kg ipilimumab or 10 mg/kg ipilimumab +DTIC). 
OS analyses from 3 mg/kg ipilimumab monotherapy (pooled) in previously untreated advanced 
melanoma demonstrate that 3 mg/kg ipilimumab monotherapy has at least similar OS (median, 1 year 
and 2 year) to the ipilimumab treated patients in the two randomized Phase 3 studies. Furthermore, in 
previously untreated patients, the median and long-term OS from 3 mg/kg ipilimumab monotherapy 
and 10 mg/kg ipilimumab + DTIC are similar and both are numerically higher than DTIC alone (median 
OS = 9.07 months; 1 yr: 36%, 2 yr: 18%). 
Table 17 – Comparison of 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg ipilimumab + DTIC 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The phase 3 study CA184024 in which the efficacy of 10 mg/kg ipilimumab +DITC was compared to 
DTIC +placebo has been submitted to support the applied extension of indication of ipilimumab in 
previously untreated patients in addition to earlier data that have been obtained with the 3 mg/kg 
dose.  
This additional study showed a statistically significant effect on OS, with a median OS with ipilimumab 
+DTIC of 11.2 months vs 9.1 months in DTIC monotherapy (HR 0.716 95% CI:0.588, 0.872; 
p=0.0009). The primary endpoint of overall survival and secondary endpoints were considered 
adequate. The results of the secondary endpoints were in line with the result of the primary endpoint 
and supported the increased efficacy of ipilimumab + DTIC treatment in comparison to DTIC 
monotherapy.  
The observed OS benefit was consistent within most of the subgroups of patients. For women above 50 
years of age the HR is just above 1, which is consistent with the results of MDX010-20 in which also a 
HR close to 1 for the subgroup of women above 50 years was found (see SmPC section 5.1). 
Yervoy 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603930/2013 
Page 42/64 
 
 
 
 
Overall, the indicated OS benefit of 2.1 months for ipilimumab+DTIC treatment in comparison to DTIC 
monotherapy is considered clinically relevant. The obtained survival for the control group 
(DTIC+placebo) is relatively long, as previous studies have indicated a survival after the treatment 
with DTIC monotherapy 5.6 till 7.4 months. (Avril et al., J Clin Oncol. 2004; Bedikian et al., Ann Oncol. 
2011).  
No randomized studies comparing the efficacy of 3 mg/kg ipilimumab monotherapy with DTIC in 
previously untreated patients with advanced melanoma have been submitted. Thus, a number of 
aspects related to clinical efficacy of ipilimumab in chemotherapy naïve patients have been discussed 
during the scientific evaluation, in particular, the use of DTIC as control arm in the pivotal study; the 
efficacy of the proposed dose of 3 mg/kg monotherapy compared to 10 mg/kg ipilimumab+ DTIC 
(used in the pivotal clinical trial CA184024). 
Use of DTIC as control arm in the pivotal study  
Although DTIC has never demonstrated an OS benefit, in view of limited treatments being available, it 
is still commonly used in Europe as first line systemic therapy in advanced melanoma as it may 
achieve objective response rates of about 20% (Huncharek M. et al., Melanoma Res 2001; 11:75-81). 
Therefore, showing superiority of ipilimumab in combination with DTIC to DTIC + placebo was 
considered an acceptable study design to prove the efficacy of ipilimumab in chemotherapy naïve 
patients with advanced melanoma. 
Efficacy of the proposed dose of 3 mg/kg ipilimumab monotherapy  
The proposed monotherapy regimen can be supported based on the following arguments (see also 
Discussion on clinical pharmacology): 
• 
The efficacy of 3 mg/kg ipilimumab monotherapy has been established in previously treated 
melanoma patients;  the baseline characteristics of the patients included in the pivotal studies in 
previously treated and previously untreated subpopulations were similar (see Table 15 Clinical 
efficacy: Analysis performed across trials); the similar patient characteristics of the two trials 
support the relevance of the results observed in a previously treated population to the first-line 
setting. 
• 
Ipilimumab PK was not significantly affected by concomitant dacarbazine, prior systemic anti-
cancer therapy (see Clinical pharmacology; Population PK); thus, major differences in exposure 
between combination treatment and monotherapy or between pre-treated patients and non-
pretreated patients are not expected. This supports the efficacy of ipilimumab monotherapy 
regardless of concomitant or prior DTIC treatment and the relevance of the results observed in a 
previously treated population to the first-line setting. 
• 
Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg induced a sustained activation of T cells for both the untreated and previously 
treated subjects; co-administration of DTIC did not affect the increase in absolute lymphocyte 
count by ipilimumab (see Clinical pharmacology; Biomarker Analysis). There is no pharmacological 
or biological rationale to suspect a different activity for ipilimumab treatment in the first or the 
next line setting, because the mechanism of action of ipilimumab is general stimulation of the 
immune-system, which is rather aspecific. 
• 
In historical comparisons, ipilimumab 3 mg/kg monotherapy was associated with an increase in 
median overall survival of at least 2.4 months compared to placebo + DTIC (see Clinical Efficacy, 
Table 16).  
•  Concomitant DTIC was associated with a markedly increased risk of having hepatobiliary irAEs (see 
Clinical Pharmacology; Exposure-Safety Response Analyses: immune related Adverse Event);The 
Yervoy 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603930/2013 
Page 43/64 
 
 
 
combination of 10 mg/kg of ipilimumab with DTIC was associated with treatment discontinuation 
due to study drug toxicity in 89 (36%) patients, and mean number of doses of 2.9 out of the 
planned 4 doses in the CA184024 study. 
•  Higher trough concentration at steady state (Cminss) was associated with increased toxicity (see 
Clinical Pharmacology; Exposure-Safety Response Analyses: immune related Adverse Event); 
Overall, based on the evidence and arguments summarized above, the CHMP concluded that sufficient 
evidence of the efficacy of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg in previously untreated patients has been provided. 
At the time of the initial marketing authorization, the MAH was requested by the CHMP conduct a study 
on any relevant difference in efficacy between 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg (Study CA184169, post-
authorisation measure as an obligation). This study will further clarify any differences in safety or 
efficacy between 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg monotherapy in previously untreated patients.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of ipilimumab in previously untreated patients has been established.  
The CHMP considers the ongoing post-authorisation measure to address issues related to efficacy of 
3 mg/kg vs 10 mg/kg ipilimumab (study CA184169) was also applicable to this extension of indication. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
The safety population for the CA184024 study was defined as all treated patients. Unless otherwise 
specified overall safety is described based on events observed throughout the on-study period (defined 
as starting from the first date of induction dosing and ending at 70 days after the last dose of study 
therapy, including maintenance doses).  
Patient exposure 
Of the 248 patient who received ipilimumab, 247 patients received at least 1 dose of ipilimumab as 
randomized. A total of 497 patients received DTIC in this study (ipilimumab plus DTIC , 246; DTIC 
251). 
The number of doses of ipilimumab or placebo and DTIC during the induction phase are presented 
respectively in the table below. Progressive disease was the most common reason for early drug 
discontinuation in both groups, followed by study drug toxicity in the ipilimumab plus DTIC group.

Patients without PD who continued to tolerate placebo or active ipilimumab were eligible to receive 
maintenance dosing. At least 1 maintenance dose of study therapy was received by 43 (17.4%) and 53 
(21.1%) patients in the ipilimumab plus DTIC and DTIC monotherapy groups, respectively.  
The median number of doses of ipilimumab received in the ipilimumab plus DTIC group in the 
maintenance phase was 4 (range: 1 to 14). Progressive disease was the most common reason for drug 
discontinuation in each group (60.5% and 77.4% in the ipilimumab plus DTIC and DTIC monotherapy 
groups, respectively).  
The median number of doses of placebo received in the DTIC monotherapy group in the maintenance 
phase was 2 (rang: 1 to 14).

b Subject CA184024-115-24072 in the ipilimumab plus DTIC group had 2 Grade 5 AEs. “Systemic inflammatory 
response syndrome” was considered a Grade 5 possibly related AE, and was considered ongoing at the time of 
death; an accompanying Grade 5 “pneumonia” was considered unlikely to be drug related, but was the precipitating 
event with an outcome of death. This death was classified by the investigator as “other-pneumonia”. 
The most common on study AEs (any grade an reported in ≥20% of the patients in any treatment 
group) were nausea (48.6% in each of the ipilimumab plus DTIC and DTIC groups) fatigue (41.7% vs

Serious Adverse Events 
A total of 68.8% of the patients in the ipilimumab plus DTIC group reported an SAE of any grade, 
compared to 48.2% of the patients in the DTIC group. Of the patients in the ipilimumab plus DTIC 
group 47.0% reported a drug-related SAE of any grade, compared to 6.8% of the patients in the DTIC 
group.  
The most common drug-related SAEs reported in the ipilimumab plus DTIC group was increase ALT 
(any grade: 19.0%, Grade 3/4; 18.2%) and AST (any grade: 19.0%, Grade 3/4: 16.2%). Other SAEs 
reported in ≥patients included diarrhoea (6.5%) and pyrexia (5.7%). All drug-related SAEs in the DTIC 
group were reported in 1 (0.4%) patients each, except for pyrexia (3 patients 1.2%). 
On study AEs leading to discontinuation 
On-study AEs resulting in discontinuation of study drug were reported in 46.2% of the patients in the 
ipilimumab plus DTIC group vs 18.3% in the DTIC group. Drug-related AEs resulting in discontinuation 
of study drug are presented in the below table. Events reported in ≥5% of the patients in either group 
included AST increase (any grade 17.0%, Grade 3/4: 15.0%) and AST increased (any grade: 16.6%, 
Grade 3/4: 15.4%) and were all reported in the ipilimumab plus DTIC group.

Death 
A total of 193 (78.1%) of the patients in the ipilimumab plus DTIC group and 217 (86.5%) of the 
patients in the DTIC monotherapy group died. The majority of deaths were caused by disease 
progression. There were no drug-related AEs with the outcome of death in the ipilimumab plus DTIC 
group, and 1 (0.4%) in the DTIC group (GI hemorrhage). The cause of death was specified as “other” 
for 9 3.6%) of the patients in each of the treatment groups. The class of “other” included death due to; 
brainhemorrhage, acute myocardial infarction, apoplexy, pneumonia, hypertension and 
cerebrovascular ischemia, coronary arthrosclerosis, respiratory failure and surgical complications (all 
Ipilimumab + DTIC group), hepatocellular carcinoma, MI, suicide, pulmonary embolism, 
cerebrovascular ischemia, cardiopulmonary arrest and cardiopulmonary failure (all DTIC group). Most 
of these patients died more than 70 days after last dosing. 
A total of 8 deaths (3 in the ipilimumab+DTIC and 5 in the DTIC monotherapy group) were due to 
unknown causes. All of these were post-study deaths (i.e., more than 70 days after last dose).   
Adverse Events of special interest: Immune-related Adverse Events (irAEs) 
Ipilimumab is associated with inflammatory events resulting from increased or excessive immune 
activity, likely to be related to its mechanism of action. These events may involve the gastrointestinal, 
liver, skin, nervous, endocrine, or other organ system.  
Immune-related AEs (irAEs) reported in Study CA184024 are summarised in the table below.

The most frequently reported ir AEs in the ipilimumab plus DTIC group (≥20%) were diarrhea, ALT 
increased, AST increased, pruritus, and rash. The most frequently reported irAE in the DTIC group was 
diarrhea (15.9%).  
Serious irAEs (any grade) were reported for 36.8% of the patients in the ipilimumab plus DTIC group 
and for 1.2% of the patients in the DTIC group.  Serious GI irAES were reported for 8.5% of the 
patients in the ipilimumab plus DTIC group vs 0.8% of the patients in the DTIC group. Serious events 
reported for more than 1 patients in either group were in the ipilimumab plus  DTIC group only and 
included diarrhea (6.5%) and colitis (3.2%). 
Serious liver irAES were reported for 64 (25.9%) of the patients in the ipilimumab plus DTIC group vs 
1 (0.4%, a Grade 3 event) in the DTIC group and included increase ALT (19.0%), increased AST 
(19.0%), autoimmune hepatitis (1.6%), Hepatitis (1.2%), hepatotoxicity (1.2%), increased gamma-
glutamyltransferase (1.2%) and increased blood bilirubin (0.8%). 
The only on-study serious endocrine irAE was autoimmune thyroiditis reported in 1 patients in the 
ipilimumab plus DTIC group. 
Serious skin irAEs were reported for 2 patients, both in the ipilimumab plus DTIC group and included

Safety 10 mg/kg ipilumumab monotherapy in comparison to 10 mg/kg ipilimumab+DTIC 
A pooled analysis of the safety data obtained from studies using 10 mg/kg ipilimumab monotherapy 
(CA184004, CA184007, CA184008 and CA184022) was submitted during the initial application 
procedure. In comparison to 10 mg/kg ipilimumab monotherapy the incidence of nausea (16.3% vs 
48.6%), vomiting (10.2% vs 31.6%), constipation (3.1% vs 28.3%) and fatigue (22.7% vs 41.7%) 
was considerable higher for patients treated with 10 mg/kg ipilimumab +DTIC.   
Although direct comparison is difficult the frequency of SAE seemed to be comparable between the 
10 mg/kg ipilimumab monotherapy and 10 mg/kg ipilimumab+DTIC. Also the incidence of treatment 
related death is not higher for patients treated with 10 mg/kg ipilimumab+DTIC than for patients 
treated with 10 mg/kg ipilimumab monotherapy (0% vs 2.8%). On the other hand the frequency of 
drug related adverse events leading to discontinuation is extremely high in for the 10 mg/kg 
ipilimumab+DTIC regimen in comparison to 3 mg/kg monotherapy but also to  10 mg/kg monotherapy 
(46.2% vs 9.9% vs 18.8%). Regarding the irAE, the events types and the frequency of irAE were 
according to the MAH similar for 10 mg/kg ipilimumab and for 10 mg/kg ipilimumab +DTIC, except for 
hepatic irAEs for which the incidence was higher with ipilimumab 10 mg/kg+DTIC than for ipilimumab 
3 mg/kg monotherapy ore ipilimumab 10 mg/kg monotherapy.    
Comparison 3 mg/kg Ipilimumab monotherapy previously untreated and previously treated 
patients 
The safety profile of 3 mg/kg ipilimumab monotherapy in previously untreated patients (CA184338) 
was comparable to that observed with the same dose in chemotherapy-naïve patients (pooled analysis 
of chemotherapy-naive), and previously treated patients (MDX010-20). In all 3 groups, the incidence

and severity of drug-related AEs and drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation were generally similar 
(Table 31). 
Table 31 – Key safety parameters by prior treatment status (induction) 
As in previously treated patients, the most frequent drug-related AEs were immune-related. The 
incidence and severity of irAEs reported in subjects treated with 3 mg/kg ipilimumab were similar 
between previously untreated, chemotherapy-naive, and previously treated, advanced melanoma 
patients (Table 32).

Table 32 – Incidence of irAEs, induction phase, for ipilimumab 3 mg/kg by prior therapy - 
treated subjects 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data for 3 mg/kg ipilimumab in treatment naïve patients was provided by retrospective 
observational study CA184338. The key safety profile of the 3 mg/kg in previously untreated and 
previously treated patients seemed overall comparable. One-year interim safety data and final study 
results of these studies will be provided as additional pharmacovigilance activities from the risk 
management plan. Section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated to reflect the additional data available 
from these studies and analyses. 
Concerning the ipilimumab 10 mg/kg +DTIC regimen, reported AEs were known AEs for ipilimumab 
treatment and also reported in other studies using ipilimumab. The striking high percentage (46.2%) 
of AEs leading to drug discontinuation is indicative for severe toxicity of 10 mg/kg ipilimumab +DTIC 
treatment and the bad tolerance of patients regarding this treatment regime. A substantial part 
(31.2%) of the patients in the 10 mg/kg ipilimumab+DTIC arm did not receive more than two doses of 
ipilimumab, possibly decreasing the efficacy of the ipilimumab treatment.  
As already seen in previous studies with ipilimumab, the majority of AEs are considered immune 
related. Particularly, the incidence of hepatitis was much higher in the patient group treated with 10 
mg/kg ipilimumab+DTIC than in the treatment group treated with 3 mg/kg monotherapy ipilimumab. 
However, most of the AEs resolved after approximately 10 weeks. According to the applicant the irAE’s 
are generally manageable and resolvable within 10 weeks (longest time to resolve hepatitis 9.9 
weeks), in the majority of patients. Still the OS benefit of 10 mg/kg ipilimumab +DTIC was hardly 
longer than the time needed to recover from the AEs, by which the benefit of the treatment could be 
Yervoy 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603930/2013

questioned regarding to quality of life. Analysis regarding the correlation between the occurrence of 
irAEs and OS suggest a positive relation. Although these results are considered reassuring, they are 
considered only hypothesis generating and no definitive conclusions can be drawn.  In contrast to other 
data of studies with ipilimumab, in spite of the high dose ipilimumab used, no treatment-related death 
was reported for the CA184024 study. Most likely this is due to an increased familiarity with managing 
immune-related toxicity; however this cannot be quantified.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety of ipilimumab treatment at 3 mg/kg in previously untreated patients appears similar to that 
of the currently approved previously treated patients population and is therefore acceptable. 
The CHMP considers the ongoing post-authorisation measure to address issues related to safety of 
3 mg/kg vs 10 mg/kg ipilimumab (study CA184169) was also applicable to this extension of indication. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which 
remains unchanged.  
2.6.  Risk management plan 
PRAC Advice  
The CHMP received the following PRAC advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management system version 8.1 is acceptable. The PRAC endorsed 
PRAC Rapporteur assessment report is attached. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice with changes. 
These changes concerned the following elements of the Risk Management Plan: 
•  Addition of the 2 retrospective studies CA184332 and CA184338 to the pharmacovigilance plan 
The CHMP justified these changes as follows: 
The CHMP considered that the interim and final results of these studies in previously untreated patients 
would provide further information on the efficacy and safety profile in the target patient population at 
the proposed 3 mg/kg posology. 
The MAH implemented the changes requested in the RMP (version 8.2) by PRAC and/or CHMP. The 
CHMP endorsed the changes to the Risk Management Plan with the following content:

2.7.  Update of the Product information   
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC. The 
Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Editorial changes were also made to the SmPC and 
Package Leaflet. 
No user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed for this 
extension of indication. This is acceptable as the extension of indication does not include major 
changes to the current package leaflet. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg efficacy in second line treatment was already established based on the phase III 
study MDX010-20 and is now as first line treatment supported by the two retrospective studies 
performed in patients with untreated advanced melanoma treated with 3 mg/kg ipilimumab, a median 
OS of 14.4 months (CA184332) and 11.5 months (CA184338) was observed. This would indicate an

improvement of at least 2.4 months compared to the patients in the control arm (placebo + DTIC) of 
the pivotal study CA184024.   
The results from study CA184024, in which the efficacy of ipilimumab in previously untreated patients 
was investigated, showed an OS benefit of 2.1 months for patients treated with 10 mg/kg ipilimumab 
+ DTIC in comparison to DTIC monotherapy (i.e. 11.2 months OS [95% CI of 9.4-13.6] vs. 9.1 
months OS [95% CI of 7.75-10.51], HR 0.716 95% CI (0.588, 0.872); p=0.0009). This benefit in OS 
of ipilimumab treatment was consistent in most of the subgroups related to prognosis (i.e. race, age, 
M-stage, performance score (PS; ECOG) and baseline LDH). The results of this study were considered 
to support the efficacy of ipilimumab  in previously untreated patients. Furthermore, exploratory 
analyses of the role of prior treatment did not reveal any important interaction. Clinical pharmacology 
data supported similar pharmacokinetics for previously treated and previously untreated patients, and 
was unaffected by dacarbazine. Thus, the efficacy of the ipilimumab 3 mg/kg monotherapy regimen in 
previously untreated patients was considered established (see Discussion on Clinical Efficacy). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Although efficacy is considered established for the 3 mg/kg dose, it is important to clarify any 
differences in efficacy (and safety) between 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg monotherapy in previously 
untreated patients. Study CA184169 was requested by the CHMP as an obligation to conduct post-
authorisation measure at the time of the initial marketing authorisation is expected to address this 
issue. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Safety data for previously untreated patients treated with 3 mg/kg ipilimumab were obtained mostly 
by the retrospective study CA184338:  54.2% of the patients experienced drug-related adverse 
events, in 16.2% of patients this was ≥ grade 3. In 9.2% of the patients, drug-related adverse events 
led to drug discontinuation. Comparable results were observed in the previously treated patients group 
(study MDX010-20), although more patients experienced drug related adverse event (78.2%, 20.6% 
patients ≥grade 3). In 9.9 % of patients a drug related event led to study discontinuation.  
As in previously treated patients, the most frequent drug-related AEs were immune-related, although a 
lower incidence of drug-related AEs during induction was observed in the pooled chemotherapy-naïve 
and previously untreated patients compared to previously treated patients (52.5% vs. 61.8%). A lower 
incidence of skin irAEs in previously untreated patients (CA184388) compared to pooled 
chemotherapy-naive and previously treated patients was 27.5% vs. 52.0% and 41.2%, respectively. 
Finally, there were no deaths due to drug-related AEs or irAEs in previously untreated patients 
(CA184338), while the reported incidence was 2.7% in the pooled chemotherapy-naïve patients 
population and 3.1% in the previously treated patient population. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The key safety profile of the 3 mg/kg in previously untreated and previously treated patients seems 
overall comparable. However, additional safety data from all patients in both CA184332 and CA184338 
and information on the safety profile of ipilimumab in previously treated vs previously untreated 
patients in pooled Phase 2/3 clinical trials will be reported as per the pharmacovigilance plan and PSUR 
as applicable.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
For patients with advanced melanoma without BRAF mutation currently only DTIC is approved as first 
line treatment from which only a limited increase in PFS can be expected. 
Efficacy of 3 mg/kg ipilimumab in second line treatment was already proven by the phase III MDX010-
20 study. From a pharmacological or biological point of view it is not rational to suspect a different 
activity for ipilimumab treatment in the first or the next line setting, because the mechanism of action 
of ipilimumab is general stimulation of the immune-system, which is rather aspecific. Efficacy of 3 
mg/kg ipilimuamb in previously untreated patients was supported by two retrospective studies 
performed in patients with untreated advanced melanoma treated with 3 mg/kg ipilimumab, a median 
OS of 14.4 months (CA184332) and 11.5 months (CA184338) was observed. An overall survival 
benefit has never been shown with DTIC, while the median OS observed with ipilimumab is 
consistently at least > 2 months longer regardless of the line of therapy used as shown by the results 
from the pivotal and the supportive studies. The efficacy of the 10 mg/kg ipilimumab + DTIC regimen 
in the CA184024 study was considered to support the efficacy of ipilimumab in previously untreated 
patients.   
The data of the retrospective observational studies are useful for assessing the safety of 3 mg/kg 
ipilimumab for the treatment of previously untreated patients. Based on the data provided, the results 
do not indicate additional safety issues for first line ipilimumab in comparison to second line ipilimumab 
treatment for key safety issues.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Based on the clinically relevant effect on overall survival and the acceptable safety profile the benefit 
risk balance of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg as monotherapy is considered to be positive for the treatment of 
advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
Overall, the benefit/risk of 3 mg/kg ipilimumab treatment in patients with advanced melanoma without 
restriction regarding the line of treatment is considered positive. Estimation of the effect in previously 
untreated patients was based on several factors; similarity between patient characteristics of 
previously treated and untreated patients, the pharmacological rationale assuming similar activity for 
ipilimumab in different treatment setting and consistent beneficial effect on OS in comparison to DTIC 
observed in the clinical trials regardless the line of therapy.    
Regarding the safety, the data from the observational studies increase the database for safety 
considerably and indicate a similar safety profile for first and second line ipilimumab treatment 
(3 mg/kg). The safety of the 3 mg/kg dose appears more acceptable than that of the 10 mg/kg dose.

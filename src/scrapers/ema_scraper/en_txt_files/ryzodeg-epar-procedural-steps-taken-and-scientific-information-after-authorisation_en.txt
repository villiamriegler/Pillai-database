Update of sections 4.2 and section 5.1 of the SmPC 
in order to update the information on dosing and 
administration interval of Ryzodeg (insulin 
aspart/insulin degludec) based on data from 2 trials: 
• 
NN5401-4266, a 38 week trial comparing 
effect and safety of insulin degludec/insulin aspart 
vs. insulin glargine plus insulin aspart in subjects 
with type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin with 
or without oral antidiabetic treatment in need of 
treatment intensification. 
• 
NN5401-3996, a 26-week trial comparing 
efficacy and safety of insulin degludec/insulin aspart 
BID and insulin degludec OD plus insulin aspart in 
subjects with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus treated with 
basal insulin in need of treatment intensification with 
mealtime insulin. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make 
editorial changes in the SmPC.

administered once or twice daily with the main meal(s) 
alone, in combination with oral antidiabetic medicinal 
products, and in combination with bolus insulin. When 
using Ryzodeg once-daily, changing to twice daily should 
be considered when higher doses are needed, e.g. to avoid 
hypoglycaemia. Split the dose based on individual patient’s 
needs and administer with main meals. 
Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus: Ryzodeg can be 
administered once daily at mealtime in combination with 
short-/rapid-acting insulin at the remaining meals. 
Section 5.1 of the SmPC was updated to reflect the 
additional data provided (please refer to the product 
information for the detailed results).

SmPC 
The summary of product characteristics (section 5.1) was 
clinical data from a cardiovascular outcome trial 
EX1250-4080 (DEVOTE) conducted for insulin 
degludec. DEVOTE was a randomised, double-blind 
and event-driven clinical trial with a median duration 
of 2 years comparing the cardiovascular safety of 
insulin degludec versus insulin glargine (100 
units/mL) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus at 
high risk of cardiovascular events. 
Based on the long-term exposure and safety data 
from DEVOTE which are also relevant for insulin 
degludec/insulin aspart, the Ryzodeg SmPC is 
updated with data from the trial in alignment with a 
recent update of the SmPC for insulin degludec. 
updated with new clinical data from a cardiovascular 
outcome study (DEVOTE) focusing on insulin degludec, the 
long-acting component of Ryzodeg. The data presented 
show that Ryzodeg did not alter the relative risk of 
cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular mortality when 
compared to insulin glargine in a population at high risk of 
cardiovascular events.

Section 6.5 of the SmPC is also being amended for 
an editorial improvement to more precisely describe 
the nature of the plunger stopper. 
The RMP version 7 has consequently been agreed.

Update of sections 4.2, 4.4 and 6.6 of the SmPC and 
relevant sections of the labelling and PL to minimise 
the potential risk of medication error as requested by 
the PRAC in the course of a signal assessment (EPITT 
ref. No. 18893). 
The re-use of insulin pen needles increases the risk of 
blocked needles, which may cause under- or overdosing. In 
the event of blocked needles, patients must follow the 
instructions described in the instructions for use 
accompanying the package leaflet.

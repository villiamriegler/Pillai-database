2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This is a generic application of medicinal product Dapagliflozin 5mg and 10mg tablets according to 
Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended submitted through a centralised procedure. The 
reference product is Forxiga, 5mg, 10mg Film-coated tablet, which containing the same active 
substances in the same strengths and was approved approved on 11 November 2012 via the 
centralised procedure (EU/1/12/795).   
The drug substance dapagliflozin competitively, reversibly, and highly selectively inhibits Sodium-
glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2). SGLT2s are expressed in the kidney and on the epithelial lining of 
the Si segment of the proximal convoluted tubule. Physiologically, these transporters are responsible 
for approximately 90% of renal glucose absorption. By blocking SGLT2 with Dapagliflozin, reabsorption 
of glucose into the bloodstream is diminished. Dapagliflozin promotes glucose filtration through the 
kidneys and into the urine to be eliminated from the body. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction  
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing 5 mg or 10 mg of dapagliflozin as 
active substance.  
Other ingredients are microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, crospovidone, sodium 
laurylsulfate, silica colloidal anhydrous and magnesium stearate in tablet core and polyvinyl alcohol, 
macrogol 6000, talc, titanium dioxide and iron oxide yellow as film-coating.  
The product is available in OPA/Alu/PVC-Alu blister or HDPE bottle. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
2.2.2.1.  General Information 
The  chemical  name  of  dapagliflozin  is  (2S,3R,4R,5S,6R)-2-(4-Chloro-3-(4-ethoxybenzyl)phenyl)-6-
(hydroxymethyl)  tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3,4,5-triol  corresponding  to  the  molecular  formula  C21H25ClO6. 
Dapagliflozin is supplied as dapagliflozin premix in this procedure. Premix is combination of dapagliflozin 
with mannitol (1:4). It has a relative molecular mass of 408.87 g/mol (dapagliflozin) and 182.172 g/mol 
(mannitol) and the following structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/68353/2023  
Page 10/25 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1: Active substance structure 
The chemical structure of dapagliflozin premix was elucidated by a combination of elemental analysis, 
FTIR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, MS and UV. The solid state properties of the active substance were measured 
by XRPD and DSC. 
The dapagliflozin premix is a white to off white powder, slightly hygroscopic, soluble in dimethylsulfoxide, 
practically insoluble in cyclohexane and slightly soluble in different pH buffer and water. 
Dapagliflozin exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of five chiral centres. Enantiomeric purity is 
controlled routinely by specific optical rotation. 
Polymorphism has been observed for dapagliflozin premix. Based on review of XRD data, dapagliflozin 
premix shows crystalline as well as amorphous patterns. The crystalline pattern observed is due to 
mannitol whereas amorphous pattern is due to dapagliflozin. The polymorphic form in dapagliflozin 
premix is identified by technique like X-ray diffraction or DSC. In addition, XRD test is part of release 
specification. 
2.2.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured by a single manufacturer. 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Dapagliflozin premix is synthesized in four main steps using commercially available well defined starting 
materials with acceptable specifications.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well characterised and discussed with regards to their origin. 
The active substance is packed in an aluminium container, purged with nitrogen and closed with a rubber 
stopper. Declarations have been provided that the aluminium bottles and rubber stoppers are safe for 
use in contact with food.

2.2.2.3.  Specifications 
Specification  of  dapagliflozin  premix  is  based  on  the  specification  proposed  in  ASMF  by  the  active 
substance manufacturer. 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for:  appearance,  identity  (IR,  HPLC),  assay  (HPLC), 
impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), specific optical rotation (Ph. Eur.), and 
sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.). 
The limits are acceptable and set in line with ICH guidelines. 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  (non-compendial  methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. The verification of the analytical methods 
by the finished product manufacturer has been provided. Information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurities testing are provided in sufficient manner.  
Batch analysis data for three commercial scale batches of the active substance are provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
2.2.2.4.  Stability 
Stability  data  from  three  production  scale  batches  of  the  active  substance  from  the  proposed 
manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package for up to 24 months under long term conditions 
(25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to 
the ICH guidelines were provided. Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed 
on one batch. Results on stress conditions were also provided on one batch. 
The following parameters were tested: description, identification (by HPLC), water content (KF), related 
substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), polymorphism (XRD) and microbial quality. The analytical methods 
used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
At 40 °C/75% RH an out-of-specification (OOS) result for any unknown individual impurity was reported 
after 6 months. Assay results and results for water content were variable at both storage conditions but 
showed no clear trends. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 18 months when stored 
below 25 °C and protected from light in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product

Page 12/25 
 
 
 
 
The finished product has been developed to be a generic equivalent to the reference medicinal product 
Forxiga 5 mg or 10 mg film-coated tablets. Consequently, the objective was to prepare an immediate 
release film-coated tablet being essentially similar to the reference medicinal product.  
The composition of the strengths is proportional. 
All  excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical  ingredients  and  their  quality  is  compliant  with  Ph.  Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
Compatibility studies of premix with excipients have been provided and were found acceptable. 
Qualitative composition and physical characterization of the reference product have been provided. 
The composition of the tested and reference product is comparable. The tested product contains sodium 
lauryl sulphate in addition to other excipients shared between the respective products.  
The dissolution profiles are accepted as similar without further mathematical evaluation. 
Biowaiver of strength 5 mg has been applied. The product meets the general requirements according to 
Guideline  on  Investigation  on  Bioequivalence  (CHMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev  01).  Based  on  the 
information provided the biowaiver can be accepted.  
Based on the provided information the tested and reference products are comparable. 
Dissolution method used for QC was based on the US/FDA recommendation. The discriminatory power 
of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. 
The primary packaging is OPA/Aluminium/PVC-Aluminium blister packs (common, perforated unit dose 
or calendar blisters) or High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with polypropylene (PP) child 
resistant closure. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container 
closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product. 
2.2.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of the following main steps: dry mixing, wet granulation, lubrication, 
compression and coating. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process and pharmaceutical form. 
2.2.3.3.  Product specifications  
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form: description (visual inspection), dimensions, identifications API (HPLC, UV), identification TiO2 (in 
house), iron oxide (in house), water content (KF titration), dissolution (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units 
(Ph. Eur.), related substances (HPLC), residual solvent (GC), assay (Ph. Eur.), and microbial test (Ph. 
Eur.). 
The specifications proposed for the control of the finished product provide an adequate control of the 
finished product quality after production and during shelf-life. The results presented show compliance

with specifications. Each parameter of specification has been justified based on the relevant guidelines 
and manufacturer experiences. The limits are acceptable. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based 
approach.  The  provided  risk  assessment  (RA)  complies  with  the  ICH  Q3D  Guideline  for  Elemental 
Impurities  Option  2b.  The  results  of  the  RA  show  that  none  of  the  evaluated  elemental  impurities 
exceeded neither the PDE established in the ICH Q3D guideline nor the control threshold of the 30% of 
Product Limit. The Applicant does not consider additional control actions in the finished product. This is 
accepted. 
A  risk  evaluation  concerning  the  presence  of  nitrosamine  impurities  in  the  finished  product  has  been 
performed (as requested) considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions 
and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004  referral  on  nitrosamine  impurities  in  human  medicinal  products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “European Medicines Regulatory Network approach for the implementation 
of the CHMP Opinion pursuant to Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) Nº 726/2004 for nitrosamine impurities 
in human medicines (EMA/425645/2020). Based on the information provided it is accepted that no risk 
was identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related 
finished product. Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and 
impurities testing has been presented.  
Batch analysis results are provided for three production scale batches of each strength confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification. 
2.2.3.4.  Stability of the product 
Stability  data  from  three  (minimal)  production  scale  batches  of  finished  product  stored  for  up  to  36 
months for blister and 24 months for bottle under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 
6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the 
primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for description, water, dissolution, related substances, assay, and microbiological 
test. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
No significant changes have been observed. 
One  batch  of  each  strength  of  the  finished  product  have  been  subjected  to  photostability  studies 
performed under conditions that are in line with the ICH Q1B guideline. The results show that the finished 
product is not sensitive to light. Forced degradation study was performed during validation of the HPLC 
method for assay and related substances. The methods are stability indicating. 
In-use stability studies confirmed the shelf-life of the HDPE bottle after first opening of 90 days.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months with no storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable.

2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment studies were submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Dapagliflozin Viatris manufactured by Viatris Limited is considered unlikely to result in 
any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all dapagliflozin containing products and the 
exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of dapagliflozin are well known. A non-
clinical clinical overview based on literature review is considered appropriate. In the overview, the 
applicant has also adequately discussed the impurity profile of the drug substance in the non-clinical 
overview.  
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product.   
The MAA is approvable from the non-clinical point of view. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for film-coated tablets containing dapagliflozin. To support the marketing 
authorisation application the applicant conducted one bioequivalence study with cross-over design 
under fasting conditions. This study was the pivotal study for the assessment. 
No formal scientific advice by the CHMP was given for this medicinal product.  
For the clinical assessment Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 
Rev.1) in its current version is of particular relevance. 
GCP aspect 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Exemption 
The  applicant  requested  a  biowaiver  for  the  5  mg  strength  based  on  the  result  of  the  bioequivalence 
study  conducted  with  the  10  mg  strength  (Study  BEQ-2217-DAPA-2017),  in  line  with  the  following 
requirements in Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence, Doc. Ref.: CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 
Rev. 1/Corr**.  
According to the EMA guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence, the following requirements must 
be met where a waiver for additional strength is claimed: 
a) All the strengths (i.e. 5 mg and 10mg) of proposed pharmaceutical products are manufactured using 
the same manufacturing process. 
Assessment report  
EMA/68353/2023  
Page 16/25 
 
 
 
b)  The  qualitative  composition  of  the  Dapagliflozin  film-coated  tablets  5  mg  is  same  as  that  of 
Dapagliflozin film-coated tablets 10 mg 
d) The composition of all strengths (i.e. 5 mg and 10 mg) are quantitatively proportional (i.e. the ratio 
between the amount of each excipient to the amount of active substance is same among 5 mg and 10 
mg strengths). 
c) Dapagliflozin demonstrates linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range. 
e) The in-vitro dissolution profile is similar under identical conditions for the additional strengths (i.e. 5 
mg) and the strength of batch used in the bioequivalence studies (i.e. 10 mg). 
Considering that: 
-  both  strengths  (i.e.  5  mg  and  10mg)  have  the  same  manufacturing  process,  same  qualitative 
composition, and composition quantitatively proportional 
- the linearity in pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin increases proportionally in dose range of 0.1 mg to 
500 mg 
- the in-vitro dissolution profiles are considered as similar 
the requirements are met and the biowaiver for additional strength (i.e. 5mg) is justified. 
Tabular overview of clinical studies  
To support the application, the applicant has submitted one bioequivalence study.

Methods 
•  Study design  
Study NO. EQ-2217-DAPA-2017 was an open label, balanced, analyst blind, randomised, two-treatment, 
two-period,  two-sequence,  single  dose,  crossover  bioequivalence  study  on  24  healthy,  adult,  human 
subjects under fasting condition. 
The bioequivalence study was carried out for evaluating the following objectives: 
1.  Pharmacokinetic: To evaluate the comparative oral bioavailability of single dose of Dapagliflozin 
Tablets 10 mg with FORXIGA (dapagliflozin) film coated Tablets 10 mg in healthy, adult, human 
subjects under fasting condition. 
2.  Safety: To monitor the safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of Dapagliflozin Tablets 10 mg 
when administered in healthy, adult, human subjects under fasting condition. 
Assessment report  
EMA/68353/2023  
Page 17/25 
 
 
 
 
The study was carried out in one group comprising of 24 male subjects (subject number 01 to 24). 
After check-in, there was a supervised overnight fasting period of at least 10.00 hours before dosing. A 
pre-dose sample was taken before dosing. Thereafter, a series of blood samples were taken up to 48 
hours  post-dose,  with  the  subject  remaining  in  the  CPU.  After  the  48  hours  post-dose  blood  sample 
collection,  the  subjects  were  allowed  to  leave  CPU  after  checking  their  vital  signs  and  medical 
examination. 
The test or reference products were orally administered to the subjects while in upright sitting posture, 
with  240  mL  of  20%  w/v  glucose  solution  in  water  at  room  temperature  as  per  the  randomization 
schedule under the supervision of the Medical Officer followed by examination of the oral cavity. 
There was a washout period of 7 days from the completion of dosing between two consecutive periods. 
Concentration of dapagliflozin was measured in plasma samples of the subjects. Blood samples (1 x 5 
mL) were collected in 5 mL blood collection tube containing K2EDTA as anticoagulant during each period. 
The venous blood samples were withdrawn pre-dose and at 0.08, 0.17, 0.33, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 1.25, 
1.50, 1.75, 2.00, 2.33, 2.67, 3.00, 4.00, 6.00, 8.00, 12.00, 18.00, 24.00, 30.00, 36.00 and 48.00 hours 
post-dose (time points being relative to the investigational product dosing). 
The plasma samples of subjects were analysed by a validated LC-MS/MS method. 
Protocol deviations 
o  Time Point Deviation 
As per protocol, blood samples should be collected within two minutes of scheduled time for 
blood collection for in-house samples. All actual times of the sample withdrawal were recorded 
in  the  bleed  sheet.  However,  there  were  following  deviations  from  the  schedule  time  of  the 
collection above the permitted deviation time in the study. 
A few deviations were found in the blood sampling. These deviations are not expected to significantly 
impact the results of the study. 
No concomitant medication was reported. 
•  Test and reference products  
Dapagliflozin Viatris 10mg film-coated tablets has been compared to Forxiga 10mg film-coated tablets. 
•  Population(s) studied 
A total of 24 healthy adult human subjects (male, between 21 and 44 years of age and having a Body 
Mass  Index  (BMI)  between  19.3  and  28.6)  were  enrolled.  No  female  volunteers  were  included  in  the 
study.  
Assessment report  
EMA/68353/2023  
Page 18/25 
 
 
 
 
Of  these  24  subjects,  23  subjects  completed  both  the  periods  of  the  study.  Subject  number  15  was 
withdrawn from the study in period 2 (pre-dose) on principal investigator advice due to adverse event 
during check-in. 
The  study  was  conducted  only  on  Asian  population.  However,  no  clinically  relevant  inter-ethnic 
differences were observed regarding dapagliflozin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Moreover, 
the design of the study was crossover, therefore the chosen population is considered acceptable. 
•  Analytical methods 
Data of Dapagliflozin in human plasma samples was gathered from the study BEQ-2217-DAPA-2017 
using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric method for 
dapagliflozin, to determine the concentration of dapagliflozin in the samples of all analysed subjects.  
A detailed description of the operative procedures and the validation process were provided. 
•  Pharmacokinetic variables 
The  pharmacokinetic  parameters  were  calculated  by  non-compartmental  methods  using  SAS® version 
9.4.  
The  following  pharmacokinetic  parameters  (variables)  of  dapagliflozin  were  estimated  after  drug 
administration under fasting conditions 
- 
- 
primary variables: Cmax and AUC0-t, 
secondary variables: AUC0-∞, t1/2, kel and residual area. 
These  parameters  were  derived  individually  for  each  subject  from  their  dapagliflozin  concentration  in 
plasma. Actual time of blood collection was considered for pharmacokinetic calculations. For estimation 
of PK parameters, concentrations that were below level of quantification (BLQ) were assigned a value of 
zero. In the calculations of PK parameters, missing values were ignored. 
•  Statistical methods 
Statistical analyses were performed. Reported summary statistics for all pharmacokinetic parameters for 
both the test and reference products were the minimum, maximum, arithmetic means, median, standard 
deviation and the coefficient of variation for untransformed data. 
Log-transformed  pharmacokinetic  parameters  (Cmax  and  AUC0-t)  for  dapagliflozin  were  analysed  using 
standard analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with the main effects of “sequence, period, formulation 
and  subject  nested  within  sequence”.  Separate  ANOVA  model  was  used  to  analyse  each  of  the 
parameters. Each ANOVA included calculation of mean square error, p-value of factors and the associated 
degrees  of  freedom.  The  sequence  effect  was  tested  at  5%  level  of  significance  with  subjects  nested 
within  sequence  as  an  error  term.  The  formulation  and  period  effects  were  tested  at  5%  level  of 
significance.  
Ninety-percent (90%) confidence intervals were calculated for the ratio of both the products averages 
(geometric means) by first calculating the 90% confidence intervals for the differences in the averages 
(least  square  means)  of  the  log-transformed  data  and  then  taking  the  antilogarithms  of  the  obtained 
confidence limits.  
Criteria for conclusion of bioequivalence:

The 90% confidence intervals for Cmax and AUC0-t of dapagliflozin had to entirely fall in the acceptance 
range of 80.00% - 125.00% for log-transformed data to conclude the test product was bioequivalent to 
the reference product under fasting conditions.

Formulation effect was found to be statistically insignificant (p-value ≥ 0.05) for Cmax & AUC0-t. 
Period effect found to be statistically insignificant (p-value ≥ 0.05) for AUC0-t but statistically significant 
(p-value < 0.05) for Cmax. 
Sequence effect found to be statistically insignificant (p-value ≥ 0.05) for Cmax & AUC0-t. 
A significant period effect is caused by the fact that in one of the two periods, the plasma levels Cmax are 
higher / lower than in other. This may be due to different conditions in period 1 and period 2. Some of 
the causes for significant period effects are volunteers, meal plan, dosing procedure and environmental 
conditions. However, in this study all the conditions in period 1 and period 2 were identical. These are: 
-  Same volunteers were enrolled in both periods. Moreover, none of the volunteers had taken any 
medicine between period 1 and period 2. 
-  Same meal plan was given to volunteers in both periods. 
-  Dosing procedure was same in both periods. 
- 
Environmental conditions during dispensing and sample separation were similar in both periods. 
Thus, based on the above observations, since the conditions in period 1 and period 2 were identical, the 
period effect appears to be insignificant in nature and may not have any clinical consequences. 
The  90%  confidence  intervals  for  the  ratio  (Test/Reference)  of  Cmax  and  AUC0-t  for  dapagliflozin  were 
within  the  acceptable  limits  of  bioequivalence  80.00%  -  125.00%.  Thus,  it  is  concluded  that  the  test 
formulation,  Dapagliflozin  Tablets  10  mg  is  bioequivalent  to  reference  formulation,  FORXIGA® 
(dapagliflozin) film coated Tablets 10 mg in healthy, adult, human subjects under fasting condition.

•  Safety data 
During conduct of the study, adverse events were reported for one subject (subject number 15). 
During  the  post-study  safety  assessment,  one  adverse  event  was  reported  for  one  subject  (subject 
number 16) due to abnormal ECG. 
There  were  few  out  of  reference  range  laboratory  values  obtained  at  the  post-study  assessment,  but 
these were not clinically significant except for subject number 01, 02, 05, 07, 10, 11, 12, 15, 17, 19 and 
21. 
There was no serious adverse event reported in the study. 
Both formulations were well tolerated. No major side effects and no relevant differences in safety profiles 
were observed between the test and reference products. 
2.4.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this 
application.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
To support the application, the applicant submitted one bioequivalence study. The study was open label, 
balanced, analyst blind, randomized, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence, single dose, cross-over 
bioequivalence  study  of  Dapagliflozin  10  mg  film-coated  tablet  on  24  healthy,  adult,  human  subjects 
under fasting conditions. The study was acceptable and in line with the existing EMA guidelines. Based 
on the results of the study, bioequivalence between the test (Dapagliflozin film-coated Tablets 10 mg)  
and Forxiga and reference product (Forxiga film-coated Tablets 10 mg) is demonstrated.  
A biowaiver was requested for the 5 mg strength. The relevant requirements for this biowaiver described 
in the EMA guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence were met, therefore the biowaiver for the 
additional strength (i.e. 5 mg) is justified. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
Based on the presented bioequivalence study Dapagliflozin Viatris is considered bioequivalent with 
Forxiga. 
2.5.  The results of study BEQ-2217-DAPA-2017 with 10mg formulation can 
be extrapolated to other strengths 5mg, according to conditions in the

submitted and found acceptable.  
3.  Benefit-risk balance  
This  application  concerns  a  generic  version  of  Dapagliflozin  film-coated  tablet  (5  mg;  10  mg).  The 
reference product Forxiga film-coated tablet (5 mg; 10 mg) is indicated for the treatment of: 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus 
Dapagliflozin Viatris is indicated in adults and children aged 10 years and above for the treatment 
of insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise 
- as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance. 
- in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. 
For  study  results  with  respect  to  combination  of  therapies,  effects  on  glycaemic  control, 
cardiovascular and renal events, and the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1. 
Heart failure 
Dapagliflozin Viatris is indicated in adults for the treatment of symptomatic chronic heart failure 
with reduced ejection fraction. 
Chronic kidney disease 
Dapagliflozin Viatris is indicated in adults for the treatment of chronic kidney disease. 
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available 
non-clinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient.  
From  a  clinical  perspective,  this  application  does  not  contain  new  data  on  the  pharmacokinetics  and 
pharmacodynamics  as  well  as  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  the  active  substance;  the  applicant’s  clinical 
overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature is considered sufficient. 
The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis with an open label, balanced, analyst blind, randomised, 
two-treatment,  two-period,  two-sequence,  single  dose,  crossover  bioequivalence  study.  The  study 
design is considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line with the 
respective  European  requirements.  Choice  of  dose,  sampling  points,  overall  sampling  time  as  well  as 
wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical 
methods applied are adequate. 
The  test  formulation  of Dapagliflozin  Viatris  met the  protocol-defined  criteria  for  bioequivalence  when 
compared with Forxiga. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-
t,  AUC0-∞,  and  Cmax  were  all  contained  within  the  protocol-defined  acceptance  range  of  80.00  to 
125.00%. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.

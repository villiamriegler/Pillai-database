Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for blinatumomab, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Taking into account cases of cranial nerve disorder reported with blinatumomab from clinical trials, 
spontaneous reporting and post-marketing surveillance, including a number of serious cases, cases with 
positive de-challenge, two cases of positive re-challenge, biological plausibility, suggestive temporal 
chronology and the fact that cranial nerve disorders were reported as isolated symptoms without other 
signs of neurotoxicity, the term cranial nerve disorders should be added to the list of adverse drug 
reactions with frequency uncommon (≥1/1000 to <1/100). 
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considered that change to the 
product information of medicinal product containing blinatumomab was warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for blinatumomab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing blinatumomab is unchanged subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

Update of section 4.5 of the SmPC in order to include 
a new drug-drug interaction with deferasirox. Section 
2 of the Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. In 
addition, the MAH took the opportunity to delete 
glycerol from the list of excipients listed in section 3 
“In an interaction study with healthy volunteers, co-
administration of deferasirox (30 mg/kg/day, 4 days), a 
weak moderate inhibitor of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, and 
repaglinide (single dose, 0.5 mg) resulted in an increase in 
repaglinide systemic exposure (AUC) to 2.3-fold (90% CI 
[2.03-2.63]) of control, a 1.6-fold (90% CI [1.42-1.84]) an

C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
increase in Cmax of 62%, and a small, significant decrease 
in blood glucose values. Since the interaction has not been 
established with dosages higher than 0.5 mg for 
repaglinide, the concomitant use of deferasirox with 
repaglinide should be avoided. If the combination appears 
necessary, careful clinical and blood glucose monitoring 
should be performed (see section 4.4). If repaglinide and 
deferasirox are used concomitantly, consider decreasing 
the dose of repaglinide and perform careful monitoring of 
blood glucose levels.”

SmPC and PL 
At the time of the second renewal of the Marketing 
Product Characteristics (SPC) with  new safety 
information regarding the hepatic uptake of 
repaglinide and the drug-drug interaction between 
repaglinide and ciclosporin, as requested by the 
CHMP at the time of the second renewal of the 
Marketing Authorisation (EMEA/H/C/187/R/73).  
Relevant sections of the Package Leaflet (PL) were 
updated accordingly. Furthermore, minor corrections 
have been made in the PL to ensure compliance with 
the latest QRD template. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
Authorisation (MA) of Novonorm (EMEA/H/C/187/R/73), 
the Marketing Authorisation Holder committed to submit a 
type II variation to update sections 4.5 and 4.8 of the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) with information 
regarding the hepatic uptake of repaglinide and the drug-
drug interaction between repaglinide and ciclosporin (an 
immunosuppressive drug).  
Initially, data indicated that repaglinide was metabolised 
predominately by cytochrome P3A4 (CYP3A4). However, 
subsequent in vitro studies and clinical studies in healthy 
volunteers indicate that repaglinide is metabolised 
predominantly by CYP2C8, and to a lesser extent also by 
CYP3A4, but that the relative contribution of CYP3A4 can be 
increased if CYP2C8 is inhibited. Consequently, metabolism, 
and therefore clearance of repaglinide, may be altered by 
drugs which influence these CYP-450 enzymes via inhibition 
or induction. More recent research shows that repaglinide is 
also a substrate for active hepatic uptake via the organic 
anion transporting protein OAT1P1B. Furthermore, drugs 
that inhibit OAT1P1B, alone or concomitantly with inhibition 
of CYP3A4 and/or CYP2C8, may have a potential to 
increase plasma concentrations of repaglinide. This 
information was included in the SPC. 
Based on the above pharmacokinetic findings in connection 
with ciclosporin, known to inhibit OATP1B1 as well as 
CYP3A4, a statement regarding the effects of ciclosporin on

repaglinide pharmacokinetics was included in the SPC. A 
similar wording regarding the concomitant use of 
trimethoprim with repaglinide was also included taking into 
account the larger increase in exposure observed with 
trimethoprim. 
Furthermore, information regarding the possible increased 
risk of hypoglycaemia due to interactions was included in 
section 4.8 of the SPC.

the potential cardiovascular risk of repaglinide. The purpose 
and PL 
of this study was to compare the rate of major 
cardiovascular events among type 2 diabetic patients 
treated with repaglinide as monotherapy or as part of 
combination therapy compared with type 2 diabetic 
patients, who use sulfonylureas and with other patients 
who use non-insulin secretagogue metformin or acarbose 
pharmacotherapy. 
Based on the study results the SPC was updated to reflect 
that and that in an epidemiological study, a higher 
incidence of acute coronary syndrome (e.g. myocardial 
infarction) was reported in repaglinide treated patients as 
compared to sulfonylurea treated patients. However, the 
CHMP acknowledged that causality of the relationship 
remains uncertain.

Based on recent interaction studies the MAH applied for an 
(sections 4.4 and 4.5) and Package Leaflet with 
recent information on CYP2C8 metabolism and co-
administration of trimethoprim and rifampicin. In 
addition, barbiturates and carbamazepine have been 
included with the list of substances that reduce the 
hypoglycaemic effect of repaglinide. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
update of section 4.4 and 4.5 of the SPC to reflect 
information on CYP2C8 metabolism and co-administration 
of trimethoprim and rifampicin.  
Concerning the interaction between repaglinide and 
trimethoprim, the CHMP concluded that co-administration 
of trimethoprim and repaglinide increased the exposure of 
repaglinide without affecting blood glucose levels in healthy 
volunteers. Only dosages of 0,25 mg repaglinide and 320 
mg trimethoprim (minimal therapeutic dose) have been 
used in the interaction study. The CHMP was of the opinion 
that, since the safety profile of this combination has not 
NovoNorm

been established with dosages higher than 0.25 mg for 
repaglinide and 320 mg for trimethoprim, the concomitant 
use of trimethoprim with repaglinide should be avoided. If 
necessary, a close clinical and biological monitoring should 
be recommended. The CHMP concluded that this 
information should be described in the SPC. 
Regarding the concomitant use of repaglinide and 
rifampicin, the CHMP considered that co-administration of 
rifampicin and repaglinide produces a markedly decreased 
exposure of repaglinide, especially after end of treatment 
with rifampicin (effect of induction only). Therefore there is 
a risk for lack of efficacy. Concomitant use of rifampicin and 
repaglinide might therefore induce a need for repaglinide 
dose adjustment which should be based on carefully 
monitored blood glucose concentrations. The CHMP 
concluded that this information should be described in the 
SPC. 
In addition the barbiturates and carbamazepine have been 
included with the list of substances that reduce the 
hypoglycaemic effect of repaglinide in section 4.5 of the 
SPC. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

Update following an Urgent Safety Restriction (USR), 
Package Leaflet 
related to a newly identified interaction between repaglinide 
and gemfibrozil. A scientific publication demonstrated that 
gemfibrozil raised the AUC of repaglinide 8.1 fold and 
prolonged its half-life 3 times. The combination of 
gemfibrozil and itraconazole resulted in an even more 
pronounced effect: AUC was raised 19.4-fold, and half-time 
increased from 1.3 to 6.1h. The MAH in addition searched 
their safety database and identified five serious and four 
non-serious reports of hypoglycaemia during treatment 
with repaglinide and gemfibrozil. Concomitant use was 
consequently contraindicated and sections 4.3 and 4.5 of 
the SPC and sections 6 and 7 of the Package Leaflet 
updated accordingly.

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
MAH applied for an update of section 4.5 of the SPC and 
section 7 of the Package Leaflet to reflect information 
regarding the concomitant use of repaglinide and 
chlarithromycin. The CHMP concluded that the data showed 
that co-administration with clarithromycin, a mechanism 
based inhibitor of CYP3A4, with repaglinide may result in 
increased exposure and enhance the bloodglucose-lowering 
effect of repaglinide. In an interaction study in healthy 
NovoNorm

volunteers, co-administration of 250 mg clarithromycin 
increased the repaglinide (AUC) by 40% and Cmax by 67% 
and increased the mean incremental AUC of serum insulin 
by 51% and the maximum concentration by 61%. The 
exact mechanism of this interaction is not clear.

1.  Introduction 
On 05 January 2016, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study (A4001031) in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. A short critical expert overview was also 
provided. 
According to the obligations under Article 46 the study report should be submitted within 6 months of 
last patient last visit (LSLV) in the study.  
This submission does not include an updated SmPC proposal. 
The MAH has communicated the intention to file an extension application for the new formulations and 
variation (C.I.6) to the prescribing information for a new paediatric indication in April 2016. 
CHMP comment 
The complete assessment of study A4001031 will be conducted as part of the upcoming new indication 
variation. Thus, this report only contains some comments related to the pharmacokinetic dataset, 
which should be addressed in the upcoming variation. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study A4001031 is part of a clinical development program. A line listing is 
annexed. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
• 
Tablets, 25 mg and 75 mg 
•  Oral solution 20 mg/mL 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
•  A4001031; An open label, multicentre, multiple dose pharmacokinetic, safety and efficacy trial 
of maraviroc in combination with optimized background therapy for the treatment of 
antiretroviral experienced CCR5 tropic HIV-1 infected children 2 - <18 years of age. 
CHMP comment 
This report only contains a limited number of comments to point out some uncertainties and 
requirements that will need to be addressed in the new indication variation planned by the MAH to be 
submitted in April 2016.   
Thus, this report does not present a final assessment of the submitted study results. The submitted 
clinical study report will be assessed as part of the upcoming new indication variation.

2.3.2.  Clinical study number A4001031 
An open label, multicentre, multiple dose pharmacokinetic, safety and efficacy trial of maraviroc in 
combination with optimized background therapy for the treatment of antiretroviral experienced CCR5 
tropic HIV-1 infected children 2 - <18 years of age. 
This was an open-label, 2-stage, age-stratified, non-comparative, multi-center study to evaluate the 
safety, efficacy, tolerability, and PK/dosing of multiple doses of MVC combined with OBT in ARV 
treatment-experienced children and adolescents (2 to <18 years) who were failing current ARV therapy 
or had failed their most recent ARV regimen, defined by plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥1000 copies/mL, were 
infected with only R5 HIV-1, and had ARV experience ≥6 months, or intolerance to at least 2 ARV drug 
classes.  
Participants received MVC twice daily in combination with OBT. The dose of MVC was scaled down 
(from adult doses for a BSA of 1.73 m2) to body size based on BSA bands (mg/m2) and adjusted for 
OBT and/or concomitant medication category as shown in Table 1.

Table 1 is referred to in the comments below. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
This assessment report concludes the current procedure. 
The MAH has communicated the intention to file an extension application for the new formulations and 
variation (C.I.6) to the prescribing information for a new paediatric indication in April 2016. 
The full review and final assessment of the submitted study (A4001031) will be conducted as part of 
the upcoming new indication variation.  As part of the upcoming variation the MAH is asked to present 
additional information and justifications for the maraviroc PK from the study, as listed below:

- 
The report describing the development process and validation of the popPK model used to 
analyse the sparse PK data in stage 2 should be submitted. Also, the MAH should present 
popPK data based on all subjects for which sparse PK data was obtained in stage 2. 
- 
The MAH should present PK parameter data (AUC, Cmax, t½ etc), and comparisons of these 
between groups (by e.g. CYP interactants, BSA group, age), for the full PK profiles in subjects 
recruited into stage 1. In addition, the PK (including PK parameters) in children should be 
compared to the PK in adults (historical data) to further strengthen the PK bridge between 
adults and children. 
- 
PK parameter data (AUC, Cmax, tmax etc) comparing the tablet and liquid formulation should 
be presented to allow an assessment of the comparability between the formulations.  
-  As limited data on subjects taking CYP3A neutral and especially CYP3A4 inducers are available 
in study A4001031, the MAH is asked to clearly support the suitability of the proposed doses in 
patients with either CYP3A neutral or CYP3A4 inducer OBT.  
- 
The MAH is asked to explain the rationale for the suggested different BSA categories used for 
dosing (Table 1) as the ranges of these are very different in size. 
Recommendation  
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required. 
This study will be fully reviewed in the future new indication variation.

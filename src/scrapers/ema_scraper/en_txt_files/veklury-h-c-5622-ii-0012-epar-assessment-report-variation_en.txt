Submission of the final D28 mortality data by ordinal scale categories of Study CO-US-540-5776 (NIAID-
ACTT1), listed as a Specific Obligation (‘SOB 13’) in the Annex II of the Product Information, in order to 
confirm  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  Remdesivir  in  patients  on  Invasive  Mechanical  Ventilation  (IMV)  and 
Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). In addition, the MAH discusses the potential imbalance in 
the use of corticosteroids and effect modification in the study.  
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Annex II to the EC Decision on the granting of the 
conditional marketing authorisation in order to remove ‘SOB 013’.

2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Clinical discussion (1st round) 
Remdesivir was given a ‘conditional marketing authorisation’ in the EU on 3 July 2020 for the treatment of 
COVID-19 in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with pneumonia who require supplemental oxygen 
(oxygen via nasal cannula, non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices, IMV or ECMO).  
The  pivotal  NIAID-ACTT1  (CO-US-540-5776)  study  was  a  randomised,  double-blinded  and  placebo 
controlled study conducted in hospitalised patients with COVID-19, with evidence of lower respiratory tract 
involvement. Treatment with Remdesivir or placebo, each on top of standard of care was for up to 10 days. 
The primary endpoint was time to recovery (defined as the first day of no longer being hospitalised or being 
hospitalised but no longer requiring medical care).  
According to the inferential analysis, the median difference in time to recovery was 4 days favouring the 
Remdesivir group. In the primary endpoint Remdesivir was hence superior to placebo in the treatment of 
hospitalized participants with COVID-19 (HR: 1.32, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.55; p<0.001).  
In  the  stratum  of  patients  with  “severe  disease”  (with  pneumonia  and  need  for  supplemental  oxygen), 
representing approximately 90% of patients in the study, the difference in median time to recovery was 12 
versus 18 days, the RR was 1.37 (95% CI 1.15-1.163; p<0.001). No difference in time to recovery was 
seen in the stratum of “mild-moderate disease”. 
Veklury 5622 II 12  
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/691378/2020 
Page 3/51 
 
 
  
 
While the differentiation according to disease strata have been discussed and agreed by CHMP for the CMA, 
a  higher  degree  of  granularity  with  respect  to  subgroup  analyses  within  the  stratum  of  the  severely  ill 
patients  was  seen  critical  at  the  time  of  CMA  in  June  2020  and  further  data  were  requested,  which  are 
subject of this Specific Obligation (‘SOB 013’). 
In  the  meantime,  a  number  of  studies,  i.e.  the  Solidarity  study  (1) ,  the  Recovery  study  (2),  Tocilizumab 
trials(3)(4)(5) and Bamlanivimab(6) have become available to show that these subgroups would deserve to be 
carefully looked at separately, since the pathophysiology of the disease changes with severity and, hence, 
a uniform treatment response cannot be assumed since this is driven by the agent’s mechanism of action, 
which, in turn, may be disease-stage dependent. 
Moreover, no difference was seen in time to recovery in patients who started Remdesivir when they were 
already on IMV or ECMO (baseline ordinal score 7), the HR was 0.98 (95% CI 0.70-1.36). Therefore, CHMP 
requested  the  MAH  to  submit  additional  data  including  data  on  28-day  all-cause  mortality  as  a  SOB,  in 
order to  better  characterise  the  efficacy  and  safety of  Remdesivir in patients, particularly  in  this patient 
group.  
The MAH has now submitted the final Day 28 mortality data by ordinal score category of the pivotal study 
(NIAID-ACTT1), listed as SOB 13 in the Annex II, in order to confirm the efficacy and safety of Remdesivir 
in patients on IMV or ECMO. In addition, data on the use of corticosteroids and potential effect modification 
in Study CO-US-540-5776 were provided.  
With  respect  to  Day-28  all-cause  mortality,  the  data  indicate  a  numerically  lower  risk  of  mortality  for 
Remdesivir in the overall population (both strata). However, this effect is mainly driven by patients requiring 
supplemental oxygen (baseline ordinal score of 5). Between-group results vary considerably according to 
baseline  disease  severity.  Neither  for  the  subgroup  with  a  baseline  ordinal  score  of  6  (non-invasive 
ventilation or high flow oxygen devices), nor for the subgroup with a baseline ordinal score of 7 (IMV or 
ECMO) a beneficial effect was conclusively seen: not for time to recovery, and neither for mortality.  
In contrast, the results may be indicative of a negative trend in patients on IMV or ECMO (21.9% vs. 19.3%, 
respectively, RR 1.13; CI 0.67, 1.89).  
In addition, the interaction tests between treatment effect and baseline ordinal score indicate a reduced or 
even lack of efficacy in the higher baseline ordinal scores (of 6 and 7) with respect to time to recovery and 
mortality.  
These results would substantiate the concept of a temporal window of opportunity for an antiviral substance, 
such as Remdesivir, in COVID-19. Based on the currently available data this window appears to be limited 
to patients in need of supplementary oxygen at high risk for disease progression but not yet suffering from 
more  severe  pulmonary  affection.  An  effect  of  Remdesivir  has  not  be  observed  in  patients  with  more 
advanced disease, as their disease course is rather driven by the host inflammatory response than by the 
virus, and hence Remdesivir as antiviral drug may not have a benefit here.  
These  considerations  are  further  supported  by  the  recently  published  interim  results  of  the  WHO-
SOLIDARITY trial that also indicate a negative trend in mortality in this patient population hospitalised for 
COVID-19. While in the analysis of the 28-day in-hospital mortality data in the overall population no definite 
effect of Remdesivir on mortality was seen (RR 0.95 [0.85-1.11, p=0.50), subgroup analyses stratified by 
ventilation status at randomisation did also show a negative trend in mortality in patients already ventilated 
at  baseline  (RR:  1.20,  CI  [0.89-1.64,  p  =  0.24]  compared  to  patients  not  receiving  ventilation  at  study 
entry (RR: 0.86 [0.72-1.04) although data did not reach statistical significance. Even when considering the 
uncertainties concerning subgroup analyses due to their limited sample sizes,  the analyses indicate that 
Remdesivir may have no benefit in the population of critically ill COVID-patients.

However,  comparisons  of  the  D28  mortality  data  from  different  trials  should  be  interpreted  with  some 
caution,  due  to  questionable  comparability  of  ventilation  status  between  the  different  trials  and  also 
differences  in  the  mortality  endpoints  (in-house  mortality  in  Solidarity  versus  all-cause  mortality  in  the 
NIAID trial).  
Clinical discussion (2nd round): 
During the assessment of this variation a major objection (MO) was raised at the first round, in which the 
MAH was explicitly asked to justify a favourable risk-benefit profile based on the overall available evidence 
in patients on IMV or ECMO when starting Remdesivir. However, in the response the MAH only addressed 
the potential risk/harmful effects of remdesivir in the subgroup of patients on IMV or ECMO at baseline but 
neither  the  observerd  missing  benefit  on  Time  to  recovery  (TTR),  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  of  this 
study, nor on mortality in patients with baseline ordinal score 7.   
The analyses of efficacy in the subset of participants on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO at baseline 
do  not  indicate  any  benefit  of  RDV,  neither  for  the  time  to  recovery  (HR:  0.98;  CI  0.70,  1.36),  nor  for 
mortality (RR: 1.13; CI 0.67, 1.89; p = 0.652).  
This is further supported by the requested additional mortality analyses for specific subgroups. The hazards 
of death in the subgroup of ventilated patient, i.e. those on non-invasive ventilation, invasive mechanical 
ventilation or ECMO at baseline (HR: 1.12; CI 0.7, 1.82) and for patients on non-invasive ventilation (HR: 
1.11; CI 0.32, 3.83), were both similar to the results seen in patients on IMV/ECMO (HR: 1.13; CI 0.67, 
1.89;  p  =  0.652),  suggesting  that  being  ventilated  at  the  time  of  RDV  treatment  initiation  may  not  be 
beneficial. Results for the primary endpoint ‘Time to Recovery’ for the subgroup of ventilated patients (non-
invasive and invasive/ECMO) are not yet available. Hence, it remains unclear if RDV has a beneficial effect 
in this patient population. 
In addition, the statistically significant effect of RDV treatment, when given during the first 10 days after 
symptom onset (RR: 1.37 CI. 1.14; 1.64) further supports that there is a temporal “window of opportunity” 
for RDV treatment at an earlier disease stage, while deterioration to IMV/ECMO has been reported to occur 
later in COVID-19.  
It is also noted that based on these subgroup analyses and clinical experience, several national treatment 
guidelines  and  learned  societies  in  the  EU  already  do  not  recommend  treatment  with  RDV  in  patients 
receiving IMV or ECMO at baseline and with onset of symptoms more than (5 to) 10 days ago. 
Overall conclusion: 
No difference was seen in time to recovery in patients who started Remdesivir when they were already on 
IMV or ECMO (baseline ordinal score 7), the HR was 0.98 (95% CI 0.70-1.36). Therefore, CHMP requested 
the MAH to submit additional data including data on 28-day all-cause mortality as ‘SOB 013’, in order to 
confirm  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  Remdesivir  in  patients  on  IMV  or  ECMO.  The  provided  data  failed  to 
confirm the efficacy of RDV in patients on IMV or ECMO at baseline, in terms of mortality (RR: 1.13; CI 
0.67, 1.89; p = 0.652).  
Risk-benefit  considerations  triggered  by  the  inconsistency  of  beneficial  effect  at  primary  and  secondary 
endpoints  analyses  among  the  overall  study  population  and  subjects  of  patients  on  IMV  or  ECMO  are 
regarded as credible because of the biological plausibility, and directional consistency. In addition, these 
results are corroborated by evidence coming from other independent trials (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6).     
The CHMP concluded that taking the lack of evidence to support benefit in this subgroup into account, the 
B/R in this subgroup of patients has not been shown to be positive. 
Therapy of patients on IMV/ECMO at baseline should no longer be indicated for RDV. Therefore, the wording 
of the therapeutic indication is revised accordingly by restricting the target population in section 4.1 of the

SmPC. Section 5.1 of the SmPC is also updated to reflect the  study results, and the Annex II is updated to 
remove the completed specific obligation (‘SOB 013’). The package leaflet is updated accordingly. 
3.  Recommendations

Update of section 4.1 of the SmPC to change the indication as a result of the assessment of the final D28 
mortality  data  by  ordinal  scale  categories  of  Study  COUS-540-5776  (NIAID-ACTT1),  listed  as  a  Specific 
Obligation (‘SOB 013’) in the Annex II of the Product Information, in order to confirm the efficacy and safety 
of  remdesivir  in  patients  on  Invasive  Mechanical  Ventilation  and  Extracorporeal  Membrane  Oxygenation 
(IMV/ECMO).  Consequently  section  5.1  of  the  SmPC  is  also  updated  to  reflect  the  final  study  results. 
Furthermore,  Annex  II  is  updated  to  remove  the  completed  specific  obligation.  The  package  leaflet  is 
updated accordingly. 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annexes I, II and IIIB are recommended 
as follows: 
Taking the lack of evidence for a benefit in patients on IMV/ECMO into account, the B/R in this subgroup 
has  not  been  shown  to  be  positive.  Therefore,  the  indication  is  restricted  and  patients  on  IMV/ECMO  at 
baseline are excluded from the therapeutic indication of RDV. The wording of SmPC Section 4.1 is amended 
as follows:  
• 
Veklury  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  coronavirus  disease  2019  (COVID-19)  in  adults  and 
adolescents (aged 12 years and older with body weight at least 40 kg) with pneumonia requiring 
supplemental  oxygen  (low-  or  high-flow  oxygen  or  non-invasive  ventilation  at  start  of 
treatment) (see section 5.1). 
In addition,  section 5.1 of the SmPC is updated with the data from the post-hoc analysis of 28-day mortality 
by ordinal scale.  
Annex II is updated to remove the completed specific obligation (‘SOB 013’). 
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly.

5.  Introduction 
Veklury  received  a  ‘conditional  marketing  authorisation’  in  the  EU  on  3  July  2020  for  the  treatment  of 
COVID-19  in  adults  and  adolescents  from  12  years  of  age  with  pneumonia  who  require  supplemental 
oxygen,  because  the  benefits  to  these  severely  ill  patients  outweigh  the  risks  of  making  the  medicine 
available despite having less complete data than normally expected.  
At  the  time  of  authorisation,  CHMP  requested  the  MAH  to  submit  additional  data,  either  as  specific 
obligations (SOB) or PAMs. 
The  current  variation  concerns  the  assessment  of  SOB  No.  13,  which  was  agreed  on  at  the  time  of 
conditional  marketing  authorisation  of  Veklury.  The  MAH  has  now  submitted  the  publication  of  the  final 
results  of  Study  CO-US-540-5776  (NIAID-ACTT1;  Beigel  et  al.,  2020  DOI:  10.1056/NEJMoa2007764)  (7) 
that includes the final D28 mortality data by ordinal scale categories, listed as a Specific Obligation No. 13 
in the Annex II of the EPAR - Product Information, in order to confirm the efficacy and safety of Remdesivir 
in patients on IMV or ECMO. In addition, data on the potential imbalance in the use of corticosteroids and 
effect modification in Study CO-US-540-5776 were provided.  
6.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
6.1.  Final  Day-28  mortality  data  by  ordinal  score  of  Study  CO-US-540-5776 
(NIAID-ACTT1)  
Methods – analysis of data submitted 
At the time of conditional marketing authorisation, data on the key secondary endpoint “Mortality at D28” 
were not available, as not all patients did have their 28-day visit. Now the publication of the final results of 
the NIAID-ACTT1 study, including the final D28 mortality data, have been submitted by the MAH {Beigel 
et al, 2020}. These are summarized below, supplemented with information from the study report, which 
was also submitted. However, the assessment of the complete CSR will be subject to the renewal procedure.  
Statistical methods: 
Mortality through Day 15 and Day 29 was analysed as a time-to-event endpoint and presented with median 
time-to-event along with 95% CIs for each treatment group along with the HR estimate and stratified log-
rank  p-values.  Differences  in  time-to-event  endpoints  by  treatment  were  summarized  with  KM  curves. 
Analyses of mortality were performed on the ITT- and As Treated-Populations. Any participants who were 
lost  to  follow-up  or  terminated  early  prior  to  death  were  censored  at  the  day  of  their  last  observed 
assessment or last captured event (e.g., the end date of an AE). If it was learned that a participant who 
terminated  early  had  subsequently  died  prior  to  Day  29,  then  the  participant  was  classified  as  dead. 
Participants who completed follow-up were censored at the earliest of their Day 29 visit and actual Day 29. 
Deaths that occurred after Day 29 were censored at Day 29. 
CHMP’s comment 
Standard time to event methods were applied that are appropriate.

Results 
Mortality (CSR): 
Mortality status at day 29 was available for 508/541 patients in the RDV group and 499/521 patients in the 
Placebo group.  
Table 1: Mortality data of patients with known mortality status at D29 
In the ITT Population, the mortality rate (95% CI) of participants by Day 15 was numerically lower in the 
RDV 10-day group (n = 541) than in the placebo group (n = 521) (7% [5%, 9%] versus 12% [9%, 15%], 
respectively).The mortality rate (95% CI) of participants by Day 29 was numerically lower in the RDV 10-
day group than in the placebo group) (11% [9%, 15%] versus 15% [12%, 19%], respectively). Results 
were similar in the As Treated Population. 
In the ITT Population, the risk of death by Day 15 was significantly lower in the RDV 10-day group compared 
with the placebo group (HR 0.55; 95% CI: 0.36, 0.83; p = 0.004) (Table 2). The risk of death by Day 29 
was numerically lower in the RDV 10-day group compared with the placebo group (HR 0.73; 95% CI: 0.52, 
1.02; p = 0.066). Results were similar in the As Treated Population. 
In the ITT Population, the median time to death through Day 15 or Day 29 was not estimable for either 
treatment group.

Ad Hoc Subgroup Analyses for Mortality (CSR) 
Ad hoc subgroup analyses were performed for mortality by actual disease stratum or ordinal score. In the 
analyses according to actual disease stratum, the percentages of deaths among participants with known 
mortality status at Day 29 in the RDV 10-day group compared with those in the placebo group were as 
follows (Table 3): 
Severe disease:  
•  12.5% (57 of 457 participants) versus 16.3% (74 of 453 participants), respectively. 
Mild-to-moderate disease:  
•  3.9% (2 of 51 participants) versus 6.5% (3 of 46 participants), respectively. 
Table 3: Mortality rates by treatment group and actual disease severity (ITT population) 
In analyses according to baseline ordinal scores 4, 5, 6, and 7, the greatest difference in percentages of 
deaths among participants with known mortality status at Day 29 in the RDV 10-day group compared with 
that  in  the  placebo  group  was  observed  in  the  subgroup  with  baseline  ordinal  score  5  (4.1%  [9  of  222 
participants] versus 12.8% [25 of 195 participants], respectively; HR [95% CI] = 0.30 [0.14, 0.64], p < 
0.001) (Table 5). In none of the other subgroups (baseline ordinal scale 4, 6 and 7) a significant effect of 
Remdesivir on mortality was seen. In patients with baseline ordinal score 7, the percentage of death was 
larger at D29 in the Remdesivir group compared to the placebo group (22% [28 of 131 participants] vs. 
19.6% [29 of 154 patients] respectively HR [95%] = 1.31 [0.67, 1.89].

The  Kaplan  Meier  Estimates  of  survival  by  baseline  ordinal  score  and  the  respective  95  %  confidence 
intervals are shown in the figures below. In the overall population, the KM survival curves separated after 
approximately  5  days  of  study  treatment,  implying  a  lower  mortality  rate  in  the  RDV-group  versus  the 
placebo group starting from Day 5 in the overall study population (Figure 1). The KM survival curves by 
baseline  ordinal  score  demonstrate  that  the  between-group  differences  in  mortality  vary  considerably 
according to baseline disease severity, with the largest difference seen in patients with a baseline ordinal 
score of 5 (Figure 3), no effect in patients with baseline ordinal score 4 (Figure 2) and 6 (Figure 4) and an 
increased risk of mortality in patients with baseline ordinal scale 7 (Figure 5B).

CHMP’s Comment: 
Not for all enrolled patients in the NIAID trial the day-28 mortality status was available. It remains unclear 
why  the  mortality  status  of  19  patients  in  the  RDV  group  and  13  patients  in  the  placebo  group  is  still 
missing, although the 29 days after randomization have long been completed and the patients with missing 
status  have  not  discontinued  the  study.  As  the  mortality  status  of  patients  is  considered  important, 
especially for the subgroups, in which even a single death more can make a difference on whether the point 
estimate for mortality is for or against RDV, the MAH is asked to clarify if these patients are loss to follow 
up or if they are missing due to other issues, i.e. problems with data transfer from the study centre.  
The Day-28 all-cause mortality data indicated a numerically lower risk of mortality for RDV in the overall 
population (both strata, group [RR 0.73; 95% CI: 0.52, 1.02; p = 0.066]). However, this effect is mainly 
driven by patients requiring supplemental oxygen (baseline ordinal score of 5).  
Between  group  differences  vary  considerably  according  to  baseline  disease  severity.  Neither  for  the 
subgroup with a baseline ordinal score of 6 (non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices), nor for 
the subgroup with a baseline ordinal score of 7 (IMV or ECMO) a beneficial effect was conclusively seen: 
not for time to recovery (HR: 1.09; CI: 0.76, 1.57 and HR: 0.98; CI 0.70, 1.36, respectively), and neither 
for mortality (RR: 1.02; CI: 0.54, 1.14; p=0.949 and RR: 1.13; CI 0.67, 1.89; p = 0.652, respectively).  
The models including interaction between treatment effect and baseline ordinal scale indicate a reduced or 
even  lack  of  efficacy  in  higher  ordinal  scale  categories  (ordinal  scale  6  and  7)  with  respect  to  time  to 
recovery  and  mortality,  while  a  greater  treatment  benefit  of  Remdesivir  was  seen  in  lower  ordinal  scale 
categories, especially in category 5 (whereby model 4 and model 1 including baseline score as continuous 
covariate clearly provide a poor fit and should be disregarded, as the proportional hazards assumption for 
the treatment*baseline score interaction is obviously not fulfilled).  
These results would substantiate the concept of a window of opportunity for an antiviral substance, such 
as Remdesivir, in COVID-19. Based on the currently available data this window appears to be limited to 
patients in need of supplementary oxygen at high risk for disease progression but not yet suffering from 
more  severe  pulmonary  affection.  An  effect  of  Remdesivir  has  not  be  observed  in  patients  with  more 
advanced disease, as their disease course is rather driven by the host inflammatory response than by the 
virus, and hence Remdesivir as antiviral drug may not have a benefit here.  
In order gain further understanding of the effect of Remdesivir on mortality in the subgroup of ventilated 
patients in the NIAID trial, the MAH is asked to provide:

6.2.  Potential impact of Corticosteroids on treatment outcomes  
Considering the reported outcomes of the Recovery study {The RECOVERY Collaborative Group, 2020}, an 
interest in combined use of Remdesivir and dexamethasone in the target population is anticipated. At time 
of the CMA, the extent of such co-administration in the NIAID-ACTT(1) study were unknown.  
Now,  the  publication  of  the  final  results  of  the  NIAID-ACTT1  study  {Beigel  et  al,  2020}  contains  some 
information  on  the  concomitant  use  of  glucocorticoid.  These  are  summarized  below,  supplemented  with 
information from the study report, which was also submitted. 
Methods – analysis of data submitted 
In the severe strata, 105 patients in the Remdesivir group (22% of the 477 patients) and 116 patients in 
the Placebo group (25% of the 467 patients) received a glucocorticoid (Table 7).

CHMP’s comment: 
Overall, in the severe strata there seems to be no important imbalances between the randomised groups 
with  regard  to  concomitant  use  of  corticosteroids.  However,  data  regarding  corticosteroid  doses  is  not 
reported. In the Recovery study, patients were treated with a dexamethasone 6 mg once daily for up to 
ten days. Based on mechanism of action and course of severe viral infections it is likely that the beneficial 
effect of corticosteroids in these diseases is dependent on the dose administered. Singh AK et al (2020) 
reviewed  five  studies  on  the  role  of  steroids  for  COVID-19  reporting  variable  outcomes  and  highlight 
possible dose effects of steroids indicating use of lower doses might be associated with more favourable 
outcomes. Insofar, information regarding corticosteroid doses (e.g. low dose, high dose) is crucial but was 
insufficiently recorded. 
In  addition,  there  was  not  differentiation  between  corticosteroids  that  were  initiated  before  and  after 
enrolment:

Source: Response to Questions SOB013, table req12647.15, p.114  
Assessing  the  influence  of  post-baseline  initiation  of  corticosteroid  treatment  is  generally  difficult  as 
initiation  of  corticosteroids  depends  on  clinical  status  of  a  patient  that  can  be  influenced  by  randomized 
treatment such that post-baseline differences between treatment groups may be explained by effects of 
study treatments. 
Results 
Results of an ad-hoc sensitivity analysis of the mortality outcomes to evaluate the effect of concomitant 
therapy that were intended as treatment for COVID-19 and were given to patients prior to and during the 
study are reported (Table 8).

CHMP’s comment: 
The  statistical  analysis  that  was  provided  by  the  applicant  based  on  a  Cox  proportional-hazard  model 
including treatment, corticosteroid use, interaction term of treatment and corticosteroid use and additional 
covariates is considered of limited value.  
In the analysis, patients were assigned to the corticosteroid group irrespectively whether treatment was 
initiated  before  or  after  randomization.  This  is  not  appropriate:  Firstly,  this  leads  to  immortal  time  bias 
because  it  is  impossible  that  patients  died  before  initiation  of  corticosteroid  treatment.  Secondly,  the 
initiation of corticosteroid treatment after randomization depends on clinical status of a patient which may 
be influenced by treatment (Remdesivir or placebo). In addition, strata analyses (e.g. mild/moderate vs. 
severe) would have been required.  
Overall,  any  conclusion  from  this  model  is  questionable.  In  addition,  concluding  from  a  non-significant 
interaction effect on no relevant interaction is not valid (absence of evidence is not evidence of absence); 
the point estimates and confidence intervals should also be considered where some numerical differences 
are seen. 
6.3.  Interim WHO SOLIDARITY trial results – Remdesivir data 
In early 2020, there were no approved anti-viral treatments for COVID, and WHO expert groups advised 
that  four  re-purposed  drugs,  Remdesivir,  Lopinavir  (given  with  Ritonavir,  to  slow  hepatic  degradation), 
Veklury 5622 II 12

Interferon  (β1a),  and  chloroquine  or  hydroxychloroquine  should  be  evaluated  in  an  international 
randomised trial. WHO SOLIDARITY trial is a large, simple, adaptive, multi-country, open label, randomised 
clinical trial in hospitalised adults. The protocol was designed to involve multiple potentially over-stressed 
hospitals  in  multiple  countries.  To  facilitate  collaborations  even  in  those  overloaded  hospitals,  patient 
enrolment and randomisation were done via online procedures and no paperwork was required. 
On October 15, interim results of the WHO SOLIDARITY trial were published as a not-peer reviewed preprint 
on  medrxiv.  (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.15.20209817v1).(8)  Only  interim  study 
results concerning Remdesivir are considered relevant for this variation, i.e. mortality data, are summarised 
and assessed below.  
Methods – analysis of data submitted 
The WHO SOLIDARITY trial is a large, simple, adaptive, multi-country, open label, randomised clinical trial 
in hospitalised adults diagnosed with COVID-19 to provide reliable estimates on any effects of these four 
alternative anti-viral treatments on in-hospital mortality in moderate and in severe COVID. 
Study population 
Main inclusion criteria 
Consenting adults (age ≥18) hospitalised with definite COVID-19, not already receiving any of the study 
drugs, without known allergy or contra-indications to any of them (in the view of the physician responsible 
for their care), and without anticipated transfer within 72 hours to a non-study hospital. Patients invited to 
join the study will be those who are admitted to a collaborating hospital; no wider recruitment efforts were 
expected. 
Exclusion Criteria 
Significant  contra-indication  to  any  one  of  the  study  drugs  (e.g.,  serious  chronic  liver  or  heart  disease, 
some concurrent medication or pregnancy). 
Data reported before randomisation 
Information was entered electronically on 
•  Country, hospital (from a list of approved hospitals) and randomising doctor 
•  Confirmation that informed consent has been obtained Patient identifiers, age and sex 
• 
Patient  characteristics  (yes/no):  current  smoking,  diabetes,  heart  disease,  chronic  lung  disease, 
chronic liver disease, asthma, HIV infection, active tuberculosis. 
•  COVID-19  severity  at  entry  (yes/no):  shortness  of  breath,  being  given  oxygen,  already  on  a 
ventilator, and, if lungs imaged, major bilateral abnormality (infiltrations/patchy shadowing) 
•  Whether any of the study drugs are currently NOT AVAILABLE at the hospital. 
Treatments 
Four  potential  anti-viral  agents,  Remdesivir,  Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine,  Lopinavir  (given  with 
Ritonavir, to slow hepatic degradation) and Interferon (β1a) were to be evaluated. 
Objectives 
The protocol-specified primary objective was to assess effects on in-hospital mortality (i.e., mortality during 
the  original  episode  of  hospitalization;  follow-up  ceased  at  discharge)  not  only  in  all  patients  but  also 
Veklury 5622 II 12  
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/691378/2020 
Page 21/51 
 
 
  
subdivided by severity of disease at the time of randomization (i.e. in those with moderate COVID and in 
those with severe COVID (subsequently defined as ventilated when randomized)). 
Sample size 
The protocol stated that: “the appropriate sample sizes could not be estimated at the start of the trial and 
will depend on the evolution of the epidemic. The larger the number entered the more accurate the results 
will  be,  but  numbers  entered  will  depend  on  how  the  epidemic  develops.  If  substantial  numbers  get 
hospitalised in the participating centres, it may be possible to enter several thousand hospitalised patients 
with relatively mild disease and a few thousand with severe disease.” The Executive Group, blinded to any 
findings, decided the timing of release of interim results. 
Randomisation 
Adults (age ≥18 years) recently hospitalised, or already in hospital, with definite COVID and, in the view of 
the responsible doctor, no contra-indication to any of the study drugs were randomised in equal proportions 
between control and whichever other study drug were locally available:  
• 
Local standard of care alone, 
OR local standard of care plus one of 
•  Remdesivir (daily infusion for 10 days) 
•  Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (two oral loading doses, then orally twice daily for 10 days) 
• 
• 
Lopinavir with Ritonavir (orally twice daily for 14 days) 
Lopinavir with Ritonavir (ditto) plus Interferon (daily injection for 6 days). 
Follow-up:  
When patients die or are discharged, follow-up ceases and it is reported: 
•  Which study drugs were given (and for how many days) 
•  Whether ventilation or intensive care was received (and, if so, when it began) 
•  Date of discharge, or date and cause of death while still in hospital. 
If no report is received within 6 weeks of study entry, an electronic reminder is sent. 
Drug safety:  
Suspected  unexpected  serious  adverse  reactions  that  are  life-threatening  (e.g.,  Stevens-  Johnson 
syndrome,  anaphylaxis,  aplastic  anaemia,  or  anything  comparably  uncommon  and  serious)  must  be 
reported within 24 hours of being diagnosed, without waiting for death or discharge. 
Data monitoring:  
A global Data and Safety Monitoring Committee will keep the accumulating drug safety results and major 
outcome results under regular review. 
CHMP’s comment  
Patients were classified with severe disease, if they were already ventilated at randomisation. However, the 
type of ventilation was not reported at study entry and remains unclear.

The primary endpoint of the Solidarity trial was in-house mortality, while the key secondary endpoint in 
NIAID study was all-cause mortality. This has to be kept in mind, when comparisons between studies are 
made. 
Statistical methods 
The protocol-specified primary objective was to assess effects on in-hospital mortality (i.e., mortality during 
the original episode of hospitalization; follow-up ceased at discharge) not only in all patients but also in 
those  with  moderate  COVID  and  in  those  with  severe  COVID  (subsequently  defined  as  ventilated  when 
randomized). 
The four main sets of analyses involve the evenly randomized pairwise comparisons of each study drug vs 
its controls. The controls for those randomly allocated one particular drug were those patients who could 
by  chance  have  been  randomly  allocated  that  drug  (at  that  moment,  in  that  hospital),  but  instead  got 
allocated  standard  of  care.  If,  for  a  particular  study  entrant,  more  than  one  study  drug  was  available, 
allocation to standard of care would put that patient into the control group for each of them. Hence, there 
is partial overlap between the four control groups. Each comparison between a study drug and its controls, 
however,  is  evenly  randomized  (50/50)  and  unbiased,  as  both  groups  are  affected  equally  by  any 
differences between countries or hospitals and by any time trends in patient characteristics or standard of 
care. 
All  analyses  relate  mortality  to  allocated  treatment  (i.e.,  they  are  intent-to-treat  analyses).  The  overall 
mortality  analyses  were  of  all  randomised  patients  (drug  vs  its  control),  and  the  only  protocol-specified 
subgroup analyses are those considering separately patients with moderate and with severe COVID (i.e., 
already ventilated; the type of ventilation was not recorded at study entry.) 
Unstratified Kaplan-Meier methods plot 28-day risk. Death rate ratios (RRs) and p-values are from log-rank 
analyses,  stratified  for  3x2=6  strata  of  age  and  ventilation  at  entry.  If  the  stratified  log-rank  Observed 
minus Expected number of deaths is O-E with variance V, logeRR is calculated as (O-E)/V with variance 1/V 
and a Normal distribution. The few currently uncertain death times were taken as day 7. Analyses censored 
patients with outcome not yet reported at day 0, and censored the few inter-hospital transfers at transfer. 
They did not censor patients discharged alive, as analyses were of mortality during the initial hospitalisation. 
Forest plots (with 95% CIs only for overall results, otherwise 99% CIs) and chi-squared statistics (sum of 
[O-E]2/V,  with  no  p-value  given)  help  interpret  any  apparent  heterogeneity  of  treatment  RRs  between 
subgroups. 
The Discussion includes meta-analyses of the major trial results, based on the inverse-variance-weighted 
average of b=logeRR from each stratum of each trial, using odds ratios where hazard or death rate ratios 
were unavailable. (This weighted average is derived from the sums of [O-E] and of V over strata) In general, 
the more deaths in a stratum the larger V is and, correspondingly, the smaller is the variance of logeRR, so 
the more weight that stratum gets. Homogeneity of different RRs is not needed for this weighted average 
to be informative. 
CHMP’s comment 
Only  a  high-level  description  of  statistical  methods  was  provided  in  this  preliminary  report.  In  the  core 
protocol that was referred to in the report, no specific statistical methods were described. As far as it can 
be concluded from the information provided, statistical analyses appear overall appropriate. However, it is 
unclear whether any of the analyses was pre-specified. It is even unclear how the time point for analysis 
was determined as a sample size for primary analysis appears not to have been defined. 
The study includes several comparisons: In-hospital mortality for each of the four study drug vs its controls 
was  analyzed  in  the  overall  population  but  also  in  those  with  moderate  and  severe  COVID.  In  addition, 
Veklury 5622 II 12  
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/691378/2020 
Page 23/51 
 
 
  
 
there were several secondary endpoints and additional subgroup analyses. It is not clear which comparisons 
were pre-specified and there seems to have been no strategy for type 1 error control. 
The analysis set for each study drug includes the evenly randomized pairwise comparisons of each study 
drug vs its controls, i.e. those patients who were allocated to the specific study drug vs those who could 
have been allocated to it (because it was available at the hospital when patient was randomised). This is a 
pragmatic approach and acceptable in so far as it ensures an unbiased comparison. However, it is not fully 
clear  whether  these  analysis  sets  being  defined  in  dependency  of  current  drug  availability  of  specific 
experimental drugs at their hospitals are fully representative for the target populations.  
The  primary  endpoint  was  in-hospital  mortality.  The  preliminary  report  includes  results  for  28-day  in-
hospital mortality but it is unclear whether the time horizon 28 days was pre-specified. Follow-up ceased 
at discharge. Patients discharged alive were not censored (resp. they were censored at maximal follow-
up), which is appropriate for analysis of in-hospital mortality because discharged patients can be considered 
to  have  survived  hospital  stay  indefinitely  (because  it  is  known  that  they  survived  hospitalization, 
independently what happened afterwards). Patients were censored at inter-hospital transfer, implying the 
assumption that these were at the same risk of death as those patients not transferred. This is not plausible 
as there must be a reason for the transfer that could be related to patient’s prognosis; however, this is 
unlikely to have a relevant influence on outcomes as there were only a ‘few’ transfers (exact number not 
given). 
Outcomes  not  yet  reported  are  censored  at  day  0  such  that  these  are  de  facto  excluded  from  analysis, 
assuming these patients are missing completely at random (i.e. missing independently from their outcome 
and prognostic factors). 
The statistical methods for meta-analysis are standard methods and are in principle appropriate. However, 
while a systematic summary of the available evidence for RDV is clearly useful, particularly regarding effects 
in subpopulations, the added value of common effect estimates from a meta-analysis seems to be limited 
in this case, among other issues, there are e.g. differences in the definitions of subpopulations between 
studies.  
Results 
CHMP’s comment 
Only  the  published  interim  study  results  from  the  Solidarity  trial  concerning  Remdesivir  are  considered 
relevant for this variation, i.e. mortality data, are presented and assessed below.  
Participant flow  
From March 22 to October 4, 2020, 11,330 patients were entered from 405 hospitals in 30 countries in all 
6 WHO regions.  Of these, 64 (0.6%) had no, or uncertain, consent to follow-up, leaving 11,266 for intent-
to-treat analyses of these 2750 were allocated to remdesivir (Figure 5).  
After asking which treatments were locally available, random allocation (with equal probability) was between local standard of care (SoC) 
and  the  available  treatments.  After  excluding  64/11,330  (0.6%)  with  no/uncertain  consent  to  follow-up,  11,266  remain  in  the  ITT 
analyses. Each pairwise ITT analysis is between a particular treatment and its controls, i.e., those who could have been allocated it but 
were concurrently allocated the same management without it. There is partial overlap between the four control groups.

Baseline data 
Table 9 shows patient characteristics: 9120 (81%) age <70 years, 6985 (62%) male, 2768 (25%) with 
diabetes, 916 (8%) already ventilated, and 7002 (62%) randomized on days 0-1. For each drug, patient 
characteristics  were  well  balanced  by  the  unstratified  50/50  randomization  between  it  and  its  controls. 
Deaths were at median day 8 (IQR 4-14) and discharges at median day 8 (IQR 5-13). With 1253 deaths, 
the  Kaplan-Meier  estimate  of  28-day  mortality  was  11.8%.  This  risk  depended  on  several  factors, 
particularly age (20% if ≥70 years, 6% if <50 years) and ventilation (39% if ventilated, otherwise 10%). 
Table 9 also describes compliance. For Remdesivir the scheduled treatment period was 10 days (or to prior 
death or discharge). Of those allocated Remdesivir, 98.5% began treatment. Midway through this period, 
96% were still taking it (as against only 2% of the Remdesivir controls).

With 1253 deaths, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of 28-day mortality was 11.8%. This risk depended on several

10%). For patients already ventilated at randomisation (8%) the Kaplan-Meier estimate of 28-day mortality 
was 39%, compared to 10% in patients not ventilated at randomisation. 
Interestingly, of those allocated Remdesivir (98.5% began treatment), midway through this period, 96% 
were  still  taking  it  (as  against  only  2%  of  the  Remdesivir  controls).  Hence,  compliance  to  the  allocated 
treatment  duration  was  higher  in  the  SOLIDARITY  trial  than  in  the  NIAID  trial,  where  less  than  62% 
completed the full study course. 
Outcomes and estimation 
For the pairwise comparison of Remdesivr to placebo, Figure 6 shows the unstratified Kaplan-Meier analyses 
of the 28-day in house-mortality. No effect of Remdesivr on the 28-day in-house mortality was seen (12.5% 
for RDV compared to 12.7% for control). The death rate-ratio (RR) for Remdesivir was 0.95 (0.81-1.11) 
with a p value of 0.50.

WHO Solidarity Trial Consortium, NEJM ,Dec 2020. 
In Figure 7 below death rate ratios (RRs) stratified by age and respiratory support at entry and overall RRs 
stratified by both are shown. Overall, when stratified by both age and respiratory support at entry no effect 
of Remdesivir on mortality was seen (RR: 0.95 [0.81 – 1.11] p-value = 0.50). In the subgroup of patients 
who were ventilated at the time of randomisation, the risk of death was increased (RR: 1.20 [0.80-1.80]), 
compared to those not ventilated at study entry (RR: 0.86 [0.67-1.11]).

death in the subgroup of patients ventilated at baseline is 1.20 [0.89-1.64, p = 0.24], compared to 0.86 
[0.73-1.04; p = 0-13] in those not ventilated at study entry.

CHMP’s comment: 
In the overall analyses of the day 28 mortality data no definite effect of Remdesivir on mortality was seen, 
with  overall  p-values  >  0.10  and  a  calculated  death  rate  ratio  of  0.95  [0.85-1.11,  p=0.50).  Subgroup 
analysis stratified by both age and ventilation status at randomisation did show similar results with RR of 
0.95 [0.85-1.11, p=0.50).    
However, subgroup analyses stratified by ventilation status at randomisation did show an increased 28-day 
mortality by 20% in patients already ventilated at baseline (RR: 1.20, CI [0.89-1.64, p = 0.24] compared 
to  patients  not  receiving  ventilation  at  study  entry  (RR:  0.86  [0.72-1.04).  Even  when  considering  the 
uncertainties concerning subgroup analyses due to their limited sample sizes,  the analyses indicate that 
Remdesivir may not be effective in the population of critically ill COVID-patients. 
Rate  ratios  of  any  death  stratified  by  age  and  respitatory  support  at  entry  were  also  analysed  by  entry 
charateristics and steroid use at any time (Figure 9).

CHMP’s comment: 
No significant effect of Remdesivir use on mortality rates by geographic regions were identified. However, 
it is notably that the probability of death is higher in Latin America (23%), Asia and Africa (12%) than in 
Europe and Canada (5%), which could be related to the dynamics of the pandemic leading to over-stressed 
hospitals or to the quality of the health care systems in this regions. However, there is no clear evidence 
for differences in the treatment effect between regions (broad and overlapping confidence intervals).

Different viral variants with reduced susceptibility to RDV circulating in different geographic regions could 
also account for the slight differences in RR seen in the different geographic regions. However, no virology 
data  are  available  that  could  support  this  assumption  for  the  Solidarity  trial.  However,  according  to  the 
authors of the publication, additional data, including virology data were collected in the Add-on clinical trials 
Discovery (EU) and CATCO (Canada), which will be published separately. In general, the numbers of deaths 
in Europe and Canada are too small, to draw any conclusion between geographic regions. 
In addition, in the subgroup of patients with chronic liver disease, mortality was 7% larger in the RDV group 
(RDV: 7/36, control: 6/41) (24.4% RDV vs. 17.6 % control). This finding is also supported by the higher 
risk of death in patients receiving RDV with chonic liver disease (24.4%) compared to those without chronic 
liver disease (12.3%). In contrast, in the control group the risk of death was not increased in patients with 
chornic  liver  disease  (12.3%)  compared  to  those  without  chronic  liver  disease  (12.7%).  However,  the 
confidence intervals are wide (RR 1.82 [0.35-9.45]) and the numbers of death are too small to draw any 
conclusions.  Hepatoxicity  was  identified  as  important  potential  risk  and  is  listed  as  Category  2  imposed 
additional pharmacovigilance activities in the RMP. Data addressing this issue are awaited / will be assessed 
within the next Renewal procedure.  
The Meta-analysis of the mortality data from four different trials with random allocation of Remdesivir vs. 
SoC in hospitalised COVID-19 patients is shown in Figure 10. These meta-analyses included mortality data 
from the Solidarity trial (604 deaths in 5000 randomised), the ACTT-1 trial (136 deaths in about 1000) and 
two smaller trials (China trial, Simple moderate trial). Mortality results from each trial, subdivided by the 
initial  respiratory  support  are  shown.  The  like-vs-like  comparison  shown  below  allow  for  the  proportion 
already on high-flow and non-invasive ventilation or invasive ventilation at entry into ACTT-1. The number 
of patients already mechanically ventilated was lower in the ACTT-1 trial than those in the Solidarity trial. 
The combined data from all four studies resulted in an overall death ratio of Remdesvir vs control of 0.91 
[0.79-1.05, p = 0.20].

COVID-19 patients to Remdesivir or the same treatment without it 
WHO Solidarity Trial Consortium, NEJM ,Dec 2020. 
CHMP’s comment: 
Overall,  28-day  mortality  data  are  now  available  from  four  different  trials  with  random  allocation  of 
Remdesivir  vs.  SoC  in  hospitalised  COVID-19  patients.  The  systematic  summary  of  results  in  subgroups 
across trials is very valuable for assessment of consistency across studies. However, due to the differences 
between studies (different endpoint definition, different definition of subgroups), the pooled estimates that 
were calculated across trials should be interpreted with some caution. 
The  meta-analysis  of  the  day  28  mortality  data  from  the  four  different  trials  with  random  allocation  of 
remdesivir vs. SoC in hospitalised COVID-19 patients, included mortality data from the Solidarity trial (604 
deaths  in 5000  randomised),  the  ACTT-1  trial  (136 deaths  in  about 1000)  and  two  smaller  trials  (China 
trial,  Simple  moderate  trial:  41  deaths).  The  combined  data  from  all  four  studies  resulted  in  an  overall 
death ratio of Remdesvir vs control of 0.91 [0.79-1.05, p = 0.20]. 
However,  in  all  trials  including  “severely  ill”  and  “critically  ill”,  a  consistent  trend  of  a  different  effect  of 
Remdesivir on mortality was observed for “severely ill” and “critically ill” patients. In hospitalised patients 
receiving supplemental oxygen but not on ventilation, a trend for some benefit of Remdesivir on mortality 
was seen. On the other side, for more critically ill patients, in particular for those receiving ventilation, a 
consistent trend for an increased mortality was observed for Remdesivir in all studies (13% increase for 
NIAID ACTT-1, RR: 1.13 [0.57-2.23]; 20% increase for Solidarity, RR: 1.20 [0.80 – 1.80]; 40% increase 
for China trial, RR: 1.40 [0.20 – 9.52]). 
However,  between  trial  comparisons  of  the  D28  mortality  data  from  the  four  different  trials  should  be 
interpreted with some caution, due to:

1.  Differences in the mortality endpoints that were used, i.e. in-hospital mortality in the Solidarity trial 
versus. all-cause mortality in the NIAID study. 
2.  The type of ventilation in the solidarity trial was not reported at the time of randomisation, hence the 
proportion of ventilated patients that received non-invasive ventilation, IVM or ECMO remains unclear.  
3. 
In the NIAID trial category 6 included patients receiving high-flow oxygen and non-invasive mechanical 
ventilation. Hence, an analysis of all patients receiving ventilation at randomisation is not available for 
the NIAID. 
4. 
In line with this, it remains unclear how many of the patients in category 6 received high-flow oxygen. 
In  particular,  the  subgroup  of  patients  receiving  supplemental  oxygen  (low  or  high  flow)  was  not 
separately analysed in the NIAID trial. 
5.  The  post-hoc  nature  of  the  subgroup  analyses  according  to  low-risk/high-risk  which  increases  the 
overall uncertainties should be taken into account both for the NIAID and the Solidarity studies. 
6.3.1.  Potential impact of Corticosteroids on treatment outcomes  
As already highlighted above, considering the reported outcomes of the Recovery study {The RECOVERY 
Collaborative Group, 2020}, an interest in combined use of Remdesivir and dexamethasone in the target 
population is anticipated.  
The  publication  from  the  Solidarity  study  contains  some  information  on  the  concomitant  use  of 
glucocorticoid.  
Methods – analysis of data submitted 
During the study, 1310 patients in the Remdesivir group (47.8% of the 2743 patients) and 1288 patients 
in the Control group (47.6% of the 2708 patients) received a glucocorticoid (Table 10).

CHMP’s comment: 
Overall,  there  seems  to  be  no  important  imbalances  between  the  randomised  groups  with  regard  to 
concomitant use  of  corticosteroids.  However,  data  regarding  corticosteroid doses  is  not  reported.  In the 
Recovery  study,  patients were  treated  with  a  dexamethasone  6  mg  once  daily  for  up  to  ten  days.  Also, 
there was not differentiation between corticosteroids that were initiated before and after enrolment.  
Results 
Rate ratios of any death, stratified steroid use at any time are reported in Table 10 above. This subgroup 
analysis did not identify any effect of Remdesivir and the concomitant use of corticosteroids on mortality 
(16.6% vs. 17.9%) or the rate ration of death compared to the control arm (RR: 0.95 [0.74-1.22]). 
CHMP’s comment: 
Notable, in the analysis patients were assigned to the corticosteroid group irrespectively whether treatment 
was initiated before or after randomization. In addition, subgroup analyses (e.g. based on respiratory status 
at entry) would have been required.  
Subgroup analysis by steroid use at any time did not identify any effect of Remdesivir and the concomitant 
use of corticosteroids on mortality (16.6% vs. 17.9%) or the rate ration of death compared to the control 
arm (RR: 0.95 [0.74-1.22]). In patients not using corticosteroids a slight increase in death rates were noted 
in the Remdesivir group, i.e. 8.0%  vs. 6.9% in the control arm (RR 1.03 [0.69 – 1.54], assuming that 
concomitant corticosteroid use may be beneficial for patients. However, it has to be noted that the use of 
corticosteroids was not stratified between use at entry or use during treatment, hence the RR in the steroid 
subgroups may be somewhat biased by later steroid use.  
Interestingly, the use of corticosteroids was associated with higher risk of death in both groups, Remdesivir 
and control (16.6% vs. 8.0% and 17.9% vs. 6.9%), which may be explained by corticosteroid treatment 
being preferably initiated in patients with a worse clinical status (although no definite conclusion is possible). 
Slight imbalance in corticosteroid use seen within the groups were noted in the Solidarity trial (47.8% used 
corticosteroids vs. 52.2% no corticosteroids use in the RDV group, and 47.6% Corticosteroid use vs. 52.4% 
not using corticosteroids in the control group).  
6.4.  Discussion 
The Day-28 all-cause mortality data from the NIAID study indicated a numerically lower risk of mortality 
for Remdesivir in the overall population (both strata; RR 0.73; 95% CI: 0.52, 1.02; p = 0.066). However, 
this effect is mainly driven by patients requiring supplemental oxygen (baseline ordinal score of 5).   
Between-group results vary considerably according to baseline disease severity:  
• 
• 
For the subgroup with a baseline ordinal score of 5 (supplemental oxygen), a beneficial effect was 
seen: for time to recovery (HR: 1.45; CI: 1.18, 1.79), and also for mortality (RR: 0.33; CI: 0.14, 
0.64; p<0.001). 
For the subgroup with a baseline ordinal score of 6 (non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen 
devices), no beneficial effect was conclusively seen: not for time to recovery (HR: 1.09; CI: 0.76, 
1.57), and neither for mortality (RR: 1.02; CI: 0.54, 1.14; p=0.949). 
•  Also for the subgroup with a baseline ordinal score of 7 (IMV or ECMO), no beneficial effect was 
seen: not for time to recovery (HR: 0.98; CI 0.70, 1.36), and neither for mortality (RR: 1.13; CI 
Veklury 5622 II 12

0.67, 1.89; p = 0.652). In contrast, the results may be indicative of a negative trend in this patient 
population. 
In addition, the interaction tests between treatment effect and baseline ordinal score indicates a reduced 
or even lack of efficacy in higher baseline ordinal scores (of 6 and 7) with respect to time to recovery and 
mortality.  
Further subgroup analysis by baseline characteristics and steroid use at any time, did not identify any effect 
of Remdesivir and the concomitant use of corticosteroids on mortality (16.6% vs. 17.9%) or the rate ratio 
of death compared to the control arm (RR: 0.95 [0.74-1.22]). In patients not using corticosteroids a slight 
increase in death rates were noted in the Remdesivir group, i.e. 8.0% vs. 6.9% in the control arm (RR 1.03 
[0.69 – 1.54], assuming that concomitant corticosteroid use may be beneficial for patients. However, it has 
to be noted that the use of corticosteroids was not stratified between use at entry or use during treatment, 
hence the RR in the steroid subgroups may be biased by later steroid use.  
Recently pre-published interim results of the SOLIDARITY trial were published. While in the analyses of the 
28-day in-hospital mortality data in the overall population no definite effect of Remdesivir on mortality was 
seen  (RR  0.95  [0.85-1.11,  p=0.50),  subgroup  analyses  stratified  by  ventilation  status  at  randomisation 
may also be indicate a negative trend in patients already ventilated at baseline (RR: 1.20, CI [0.89-1.64, 
p = 0.24] compared to patients not receiving ventilation at study entry (RR: 0.86 [0.72-1.04).  
In the SOLIDARITY trial, no significant effect of Remdesivir use on mortality rates by geographic regions 
were identified. However, it is notably that the probability of death is higher in Latin America (23%), Asia 
and Africa (12%) than in Europe and Canada (5%), which could be related to the dynamics of the pandemic 
leading to over-stressed hospitals or to the quality of the health care systems in this regions. However, 
there is no clear evidence for differences in the treatment effect between regions (broad and overlapping 
confidence intervals). 
Different viral variants with reduced susceptibility to RDV circulating in different geographic regions could 
also account for the slight differences in RR seen in the different geographic regions. However, no virology 
data are available that could support this assumption for the Solidarity trial. In general, the numbers of 
deaths in Europe and Canada are too small, to draw any conclusion between geographic regions. 
In addition, in the subgroup of patients with chronic liver disease, mortality was 7% larger in the RDV group 
(RDV: 7/36, control: 6/41) (24.4% RDV vs. 17.6 % control). However, the confidence intervals are wide 
(RR  1.82  [0.35-9.45])  and  the  numbers  of  death  are  too  small  to  draw  any  conclusions.  However,  as 
hepatotoxicity  was  identified  as  important  potential  risk  and  is  listed  as  Category  2  imposed  additional 
pharmacovigilance activities in the RMP, further data  addressing this issue are awaited  / will be assessed 
within the next Renewal procedure. 
Overall conclusion: 
Overall, in the context of a CMA, the final D28 mortality data from the pivotal NIAID study, listed as a SOB 
013, were requested in order to confirm the efficacy and safety of Remdesivir in patients on IMV or ECMO. 
The final D28 mortality data did not confirm the efficacy of Remdesivir in these patients (RR: 1.13; 95% CI 
0.67,  1.89;  p  =  0.652).  In  contrast,  the  results  may  be  indicative  of  a  negative  trend  in  this  patient 
population.  Thus,  the  applicant  is  requested  to  justify  a  favourable  risk-benefit  profile  based  on  overall 
available evidence in patients on IMV or ECMO when starting Remdesivir. In addition, further clarification 
is sought on the provided data.

overall available evidence in patients on IMV or ECMO when starting Remdesivir. 
9.2.  Other concerns 
Clinical aspects 
1)  Day-28 mortality status was not available for all enrolled patients in the NIAID trial. It remains 
unclear why the mortality status of 19 patients in the RDV group and 13 patients in the placebo 
group is still missing, although the 29 days after randomization have long been completed and 
the patients with missing status have not discontinued the study. The MAH is asked to clarify the 
status of these patients. 
2)  The MAH is asked to include the final Day-28 mortality data in section 5.1 of the SmPC (including 
mortality data by WHO score). 
3)  In order gain further understanding of the effect of Remdesivir on mortality in the subgroup of 
ventilated patients in the NIAID trial, the MAH is asked to provide: 
a.  An analysis of mortality in a subgroup of patients comprising those ventilated at the time of 
randomisation  in  the  NIAID  trial,  including  those  on  non-invasive  ventilation,  invasive 
ventilation and ECMO.  
b.  A separate analysis of all patients that were categorised in category 6 and received non-invasive 
ventilation at the time of randomisation. 
c.  Please  provide  symptom  duration  prior  to  randomisation  (median  +IQR)  per  ordinal  scale 
stratum at baseline. 
d.  Please  provide  data  on  the  duration  of  hospitalisation  prior  to  baseline  (median  +  IQR)  per 
ordinal scale stratum at baseline. 
e.  Please provide key safety indices, including renal events, from the randomised NIAID-ACTT1 
study for patients in baseline ordinal scale categories 6 and 7, per treatment arm.

Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH presented the following data and considerations to support a favorable benefit-risk profile for RDV 
for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  coronavirus  disease  2019  (COVID-19)  requiring  invasive  mechanical 
ventilation or ECMO (baseline ordinal score of 7):  
• 
In reference to patient benefit, the MAH clarified that Study CO-US-540-5776 was designed and 
powered  to  evaluate  time  to  recovery  for  the  entire  study  population,  not  within  specific 
subpopulations. The study met its primary endpoint. Given this context, the MAH maintains that 
statistical findings within subpopulations of the study should be interpreted with caution. 
•  A detailed assessment of potential risk in participants with COVID-19 requiring invasive mechanical 
ventilation  or  ECMO  was  performed  to  address  the  safety  concerns  outlined  in  this  objection. 
Multiple safety analyses reaffirmed the favorable safety profile of RDV when compared with placebo 
across the range of COVID-19 severities. Importantly, a negative trend associated with RDV therapy 
could not be identified in participants on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO. 
Given  the  current  state  of  knowledge  regarding  the  management  of  COVID-19,  the  MAH  considers  it 
premature to restrict treatment with a well-tolerated antiviral such as RDV in patients requiring invasive 
mechanical ventilation or ECMO. The potential benefits of combining well-tolerated, direct-acting antiviral 
therapy  with  corticosteroids,  immunomodulatory  agents,  and  other  therapeutics  are  currently  being 
evaluated in critically ill patients, those with the greatest unmet medical need, in several global studies. 
Results are expected in the coming months, and these data will further elucidate the role of RDV and other 
therapies in this population.  
Further details and considerations of the MAH are described below. 
Study CO-US-540-5776 was designed to evaluate time to recovery as the primary endpoint. The study met 
its primary endpoint, with a statistically significantly shorter median time to recovery in the RDV group (10 
days [95% CI: 9, 11]) than in the placebo group (15 days [95% CI: 13, 18]; recovery rate ratio 1.29; 95% 
CI: 1.12, 1.49; p < 0.001). 
Mortality was analyzed as a secondary endpoint of Study CO-US-540-5776, and the overall risk of death 
by Day 29 was numerically lower in the RDV group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.73; 95% CI: 
0.52, 1.02; p = 0.066). To identify whether any subpopulations might benefit more from RDV treatment, 
Veklury 5622 II 12  
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/691378/2020 
Page 37/51 
 
 
  
ad hoc analyses of time to recovery and mortality by baseline ordinal score were conducted by NIAID (Table 
11). Among participants with a baseline ordinal score of 7 (hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation 
or ECMO), the hazard ratio for mortality by Day 29 was 1.13, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.67 to 
1.89. Thus, it can be stated with 95% confidence that the hazard ratio lies somewhere between 0.67 and 
1.89. Given this confidence interval containing 1, it is difficult to interpret the significance of an apparent 
negative trend in this population and, for that reason, an in-depth assessment of safety/risk is included in 
this response. 
Table 11: CO-US-540-5776: Time to Mortality by Day 29 by Treatment Group 
A review of safety outcome measures by baseline ordinal score was conducted by the MAH to identify any 
additional risks associated with RDV therapy for participants across the spectrum of COVID-19 severity, 
including among those on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO at baseline (see also the response to 
Question 3e, below). The results of these analyses demonstrate that the safety profile of RDV is generally 
comparable to placebo in participants with COVID-19 across all baseline ordinal scores, including those with 
a baseline ordinal score of 7 (hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO). In general, the 
incidence  of  AEs,  study  drug-related  AEs,  SAEs,  and  AEs  leading  to  study  drug  discontinuation  was 
comparable between the RDV and placebo groups within each baseline ordinal score subgroup (Table 18), 
and  the  incidence  of  the  individual  AEs  (by  preferred  term  [Table  19])  and  study  drug-related  AEs  (by 
preferred term [data not shown]) was generally similar between the RDV and placebo groups within each 
baseline ordinal score subgroup. Furthermore, the overall incidence of renal AEs (Table 20) and hepatic AEs 
(Table 22) was generally comparable between the RDV and placebo groups within each baseline ordinal 
score subgroup, and the incidence of the individual renal AEs (by preferred term [Table 21]) and hepatic 
AEs (by preferred term [Table 13]) was generally similar between the RDV and placebo groups within each 
baseline ordinal score subgroup. Thus, the MAH concluded that the detailed review of safety parameters 
does  not  reveal  any  negative  safety  trends  associated  with  RDV  therapy  in  participants  with  COVID-19, 
including among those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO at baseline. 
As noted in the Assessment Report, severe COVID-19 is associated with a systemic inflammatory response 
that  can  lead  to  lung  injury  and  multisystem  organ  dysfunction.  In  many  cases,  corticosteroids  and 
immunomodulators are administered to manage an excessive inflammatory response that is a consequence 
of severe infection. Corticosteroid use has been associated with delayed clearance of coronaviruses {Arabi 
2018, Stockman 2006}. Corticosteroids have also been associated with worse clinical outcomes in cases of 
Veklury 5622 II 12  
Type II variation assessment report

severe  pneumonia  caused  by  influenza  {Rodrigo  2016}.  Therefore,  it  is  reasonable  to  posit  that  the 
coadministration  of  a  direct-acting  antiviral  during  corticosteroid  or  immunomodulatory  treatment  of 
COVID-19 has the potential to provide clinical benefit, as observed in the treatment of other viral infections. 
The  potential  benefits  of  combining  a  well-tolerated,  direct-acting  antiviral  therapy,  such  as  RDV,  with 
corticosteroids,  immunomodulatory  agents,  and  other  therapeutics  are  currently  being  evaluated  in 
critically  ill  patients,  those  with  the  greatest  unmet  medical  need,  in  several  global  studies  (ACTIV-1

[NCT04492475],  and  I-SPY  [NCT04488081]).  On  19  November  2020,  the  United  States  (US)  Food  and 
Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for baricitinib, in combination with 
RDV, for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients, including those receiving invasive mechanical 
ventilation  or  ECMO.  This  EUA  was  based  on  favorable  results  from  a  clinical  study  conducted by  NIAID 
(ACTT-2 [NCT04401579]), where the combination of RDV and baricitinib reduced time to recovery relative 
to treatment with RDV and placebo. Baricitinib remains an investigational therapy for use in the treatment 
of COVID-19, and is not authorized or approved as a stand-alone treatment for COVID-19. Additional results 
from this and other studies are expected in the coming months. These data will further elucidate the role 
of RDV, as well as other therapies, in the treatment of COVID-19 in this patient population. 
The MAH concludes that RDV has demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit for 
patients with COVID-19. Analyses of efficacy in the subset of participants on invasive mechanical ventilation 
or ECMO at baseline are inconclusive; however, an extensive analysis of safety has shown that there are 
no  additional  risks  associated  with  the  use  of  RDV  in  this  patient  population.  Given  the  current  state  of 
knowledge regarding the management of COVID-19, the MAH considers it premature to restrict treatment 
with a well-tolerated antiviral, such as RDV, in patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO. 
The  potential  benefits  of  combining  a  well-tolerated,  direct-acting  antiviral  therapy  with  corticosteroids, 
immunomodulatory agents, and other therapeutics are currently being evaluated in critically ill patients, 
those with the greatest unmet medical need, in several global studies. Results are expected in the coming 
months, and these data will further elucidate the role of RDV and other therapies in this population. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Remdesivir  received  in  July  2020  a  conditional  marketing  approval  (CMA).  This  CMA  was  conditional  to 
certain  specific  obligations.  As  part  of  the  CMA  SOB  013  was  agreed,  to  explicitly  demonstrate  the 
benefit/risk  of  Remdesivir  in  patients  on  on  Invasive  Mechanical  Ventilation  (IMV)  and  Extracorporeal 
Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). 
As part of the RSI of this variation procedure a MO was raised, in which the MAH was explicitly asked to 
justify  a  favourable  risk-benefit  profile  based  on  overall  available  evidence  in  patients  on  IMV  or  ECMO 
when  starting  Remdesivir.  However,  the  response  of  the  MAH  only  addressed  the  potential  risk/harmful 
effects  of  remdesivir in the  subgroup of  patients  on IMV  or  ECMO  at  baseline  but neither  the  observerd 
missing benefit on Time to recovery (TTR), the primary efficacy endpoint of this study, nor on mortality in 
patients with baseline ordinal score 7.   
In  view  of  the  Rapporteur,  the  analyses  of  efficacy  in  the  subset  of  participants  on  invasive  mechanical 
ventilation or ECMO at baseline (ordinal score 7) do neither indicate a benefit of RDV in terms of the primary 
endpoint Time to recovery (HR: 0.98; CI 0.70, 1.36), nor for mortality (RR: 1.13; CI 0.67, 1.89; p = 0.652).   
There is also inconsistency of a beneficial effect at primary and secondary endpoints analyses among the 
overall study population and subjects of “subgroup 7”. HRs obtained by Cox proportional hazard models 
testing for interaction between treatment*baseline ordinal scale with respect to TTR abd mortality show a 
clear  trend  towards  worse  outcomes  with  increasing  baseline  ordinal  scale,  though  not  statistically 
significant. 
This is further supported by the requested additional mortality analyses for specific subgroups. The hazards

of death for ventilated patients, i.e. on non-invasive ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO 
at baseline (HR: 1.12; CI 0.7, 1.82) and for those patients on non-invasive ventilation (HR: 1.11; CI 0.32, 
3.83), were both similar to those reported in patients on IMV/ECMO (HR: 1.13; CI 0.67, 1.89; p = 0.652), 
suggesting  that  remdesivir  may  not  be  beneficial  in  patients  ventilated  at  the  time  of  RDV  treatment 
initiation (please refer to Question 3a and b below). 
The modest variation across study subgroups in median time to randomization from symptom onset and 
hospitalization are in agreement with the hypothesis that participants receiving ventilation or IVM/ECMO at 
baseline differ from non-ventilated subjects by disease characteristics (i.e. inflammatory state associated 
with rapid disease progression) rather than disease history. This further supports the temporal “window of 
opportunity” for Remdesivir use. 
Although study ACTT-1 showed overall a statistically significant effect of RDV on time to recovery and a 
numerically positive trend for mortality, the findings from the subgroup analysis with baseline ordinal score 
7 are of concern. No beneficial effect was seen in terms of TTR and mortality in this subgroup, which was 
observed across different studies. Taking the lack of evidence for a benefit in this subgroup into account, 
the B/R in these subgroup of patients is negative. It is also noted that based on these subgroup analyses 
and  clinical  experience,  several  national  treatment  guidelines  and  learned  societies  in  the  EU  do  not 
recommend treatment with RDV in patients receiving IMV or ECMO at baseline and with onset of symptoms 
more than (5 to) 10 days ago. 
The ACTT-2 trial with baricitinib was cited by the MAH, but it does not provide relevant additional evidence 
based on the data presented here. 
Overall conclusion: 
SOB 013 was explicity requested by CHMP as part of the conditional marketing authorisation in order to 
confirm  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  Remdesivir  in  patients  on  Invasive  Mechanical  Ventilation  (IMV)  or 
Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). The provided data failed to confirm a benefical effect of 
Remdesivir in this subset of patients.  
Hence, the data submitted in the context of SOB 13, considered as key for substantiation of the therapeutic 
indication at the time of CMA, did not provide proof of a positive benefit/risk ratio of RDV in patients on 
IMV/ECMO at baseline. Therefore, in view of the CHMP, therapy of patients on IMV/ECMO at the start of 
therapy should no longer be indicated for RDV.  
Conclusion 
Issue not resolved. 
10.2.  Other concerns 
Clinical aspects 
Question 1 
Day-28 mortality status was not available for all enrolled patients in the NIAID trial. It remains unclear why 
the mortality status of 19 patients in the RDV group and 13 patients in the placebo group is still missing, 
although the 29 days after randomization have long been completed and the patients with missing status 
have not discontinued the study. The MAH is asked to clarify the status of these patients.

Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH clarified that Day 29 mortality status is known for 508 participants (93.9%) in the RDV group and 
499  participants  (95.8%)  in  the  placebo  group  (Table  12  and  CO-US-540-5776  Final  CSR,  Table  27). 
Excluding those who died or recovered, 14 participants (2.6%) in the RDV group and 9 participants (1.7%) 
in the placebo group prematurely discontinued from the study (Table 12 and CO-US-540-5776 Final CSR, 
Figure 2). The remaining 19 participants (3.5%) in the RDV group and 13 participants (2.5%) in the placebo 
group either did not receive study drug (RDV 10 participants [1.8%]; placebo 4 participants [0.8%]; Table 
12 and CO-US-540-5776 Final CSR, Figure 2) or were recovered at the time of premature discontinuation 
from the study (RDV 9 participants [1.7%]; placebo 9 participants [1.7%]; Table 12). 
Table 12: CO-US-540-5776: Summary of Known/Unknown Mortality Status at Day 29 (ITT Population) 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The question was raised because there was a discrepancy between the numbers of patients who terminated 
the  study  according  to  the  presented  patients’  flow  and  the  number  of  patients  with  available  mortality 
status at day 29. The MAH clarified that there were three categories of patients with unknown mortality 
status at day 29:  
1) Patients who were randomized but not treated (it is not clear why these patients were not followed for 
outcomes, which would have been required for a true ITT analysis);  
2) Patients who terminated the study early but were considered recovered at time of study termination;  
3) Patients who terminated the study early without recovery at termination.  
Only  patients  in  category  3)  were  listed  as  “early  termination”  in  the  patient  flow,  explaining  the 
discrepancy. Although some aspects in study design with regard to missing data appear not to have been 
ideal  (not  following  patients  that  were  not  treated,  termination  of  4  patients  with  AEs),  the  number  of 
patients with missing data was low such that no relevant concerns result from missing data.

Issue resolved.

Question 2 
The MAH is asked to include the final Day-28 mortality data in section 5.1 of the SmPC (including mortality 
data by WHO score). 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH added the final Day 29 mortality data (presented by NIAID’s baseline ordinal score and where 
participants with unknown mortality status at Day 29 were censored at their last study visit) to Section 5.1 
of the summary of product characteristics (SmPC; Table 13). Proposed updates to the remainder of the 
NIAID text in SmPC Section 5.1 are planned to be included in the conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) 
renewal submission. 
Table 13: 29-Day Mortality Outcomes by Ordinal Scalea at Baseline—NIAID 
Assessment of the MAH’s response  
The MAH included the final Day-28 mortality data in section 5.1 of the SmPC (including mortality data by 
WHO score) as requested. However, the proposed table is not endorsed, as only the final Day-28 mortality 
data relevant for the approved indication should be included in section 5.1. As RDV use is not approved for 
treatment  of  patients  who  do  not  require  supplemental  oxygen,  information  concerning  ordinal  scale 
category 4 and also category 7 should be deleted. 
In addition, the proposed updates to the SmPC should be included at this procedural stage. This also applies 
to the restriction of the indication to patients not on IMV/ECMO. 
Conclusion 
Issue not resolved. 
Question 3a 
In order gain further understanding of the effect of Remdesivir on mortality in the subgroup of ventilated 
patients in the NIAID trial, the MAH is asked to provide:  
a.  An  analysis  of  mortality  in  a  subgroup  of  patients  comprising  those  ventilated  at  the  time  of 
randomisation in the NIAID trial, including those on non-invasive ventilation, invasive ventilation and 
ECMO.

Summary of the MAH’s response 3a 
The  MAH  provided  an  analysis  of  time  to  Mortality  by  Day  29  by  Treatment  Group  with  non-invasive  
ventilation,  invasive  mechanical  ventilation,  or  ECMO  at  the  time  of  randomization  and  known  mortality 
status (Table 14).  
Table 14: CO-US-540-5776: Time to Mortality by Day 29 by Treatment Group (ITT Population – Participants 
with Noninvasive Ventilation, Invasive Ventilation, or ECMO at Baseline and Known Mortality Status at Day 
29) 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The  MAH  did  provided  the  requested  analyses  of  time  to  Mortality  by  Day  29  by  Treatment  Group  with 
Noninvasive Ventilation, Invasive Ventilation, or ECMO at Baseline and Known Mortality Status at Day 29). 
Based on the provided data only 21 patients in the RDV group and 24 patients in the placebo group with 
known mortality status were on non-invasive ventilation at baseline. The Kaplan-Meier estimate was higher 
in the RDV group compared to the control group (22% vs. 20%, respectively). The hazard of death in the 
group  of  patients  on  non-invasive  ventilation,  invasive  ventilation  or  ECMO  at  baseline  and  with  known 
mortality status at Day 29 (HR: 1.12; CI 0.7, 1.82) was similar to that seen in patients on IMV/ECMO (HR: 
1.13; CI 0.67, 1.89; p = 0.652), suggesting that being ventilated at the time of RDV treatment initiation 
may  not  be  beneficial.  However,  results  for  the  primary  endpoint  Time  to  Recovery  for  the  subgroup  of 
ventilated patients (non-invasive and invasive/ECMO) are not yet available. Therefore, it remains unclear 
if RDV has a beneficial effect in this patient population. 
The initial thought behind this question was to allow for a better comparability of the mortality results of 
the  NIAID  study  and  the  Solidarity  study.  However,  data  published  in  the  BMJ  journal  (A  living  WHO 
guideline on drugs for Covid-19; doi: https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m3379) indicate that of 5451 patients 
enroled in the Solidarity trial, 8.9% were on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline. Hence, this means 
that all patients who were ventilated at baseline according to the published interim WHO Solidarity results 
were on IMV (487/5451 = 8.9%). Hence, data of the subgroup on IMV/ECMO at baseline are comparable 
between the NIAID and Solidarity trial in this regard.

Question 3 b 
A separate analysis of all patients that were categorised in category 6 and received non-invasive ventilation 
at the time of randomisation. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 3 b 
The MAH provided an analysis of mortality in participants who were on non-invasive ventilation at the time 
of randomization (Table 15).  
Table 15: CO-US-540-5776: Time to Mortality by Day 29 by Treatment Group (ITT Population – Participants 
with Noninvasive Ventilation at Baseline and Known Mortality Status at Day 29) 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH did provided the requested analysis of time to Mortality by Day 29 in participants who were on 
non-invasive ventilation at the time of randomization. The Kaplan-Meier estimate was higher in the RDV 
group compared to the control group (24% vs. 21%, respectively). The hazard of death in the group of 
patients on non-invasive ventilation and with known mortality status at Day 29 (HR: 1.11; CI 0.32, 3.83) 
was similar to that seen in patients on IMV/ECMO (HR: 1.13; CI 0.67, 1.89; p = 0.652), suggesting that 
being on non-invasive ventilation at the time of RDV treatment initiation may not be beneficial. However, 
results for the primary endpoint Time to Recovery for the subgroup of non-invasive ventilated patients are 
not yet available. Thus, it remains unclear if RDV has a beneficial effect in this patient population.  
Conclusion  
Issue resolved. 
Question 3 c 
Please  provide  symptom  duration  prior  to  randomisation  (median  +IQR)  per  ordinal  scale  stratum  at

Table 16: CO-US-540-5776: Median (Q1, Q3) Duration of Symptoms (in Days) Prior to Randomization by 
Baseline Ordinal Score and Treatment Group (ITT Population) 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH provided the median (Q1, Q3) duration of symptoms prior to randomization. In general, symptom 
duration increases with disease severity. This data in combination with the observed statistically significant 
effect of RDV treatment in study ACTT-1, when given during the first 10 days after symptom onset (RR: 
1.37  CI.  1.14;  1.64)  support  the  assumption  that  there  is  a  temportal  window  of  opportunity  for  RDV 
treatment early during the disease, which is not the case for patients on IMV/ECMO as those are more likely 
to have longer duration of symptom onset. 
Interestingly, the median time from symptoms onset was shorter in the Remdesivir group as compared to 
the placebo group in patients with baseline ordinal score 6 and 7.  Having in mind the above mentioned 
statistically significant effect of RDV treatment when given during the first 10 days after symptom onset 
(RR: 1.37 CI. 1.14; 1.64) longer duration of symptom onset in patients of the placebo group in baseline 
ordinal scale categories 6 and 7 might have prevented a more pronounced negative trend of RDV treatment 
in these patients.  
Conclusion  
Issue resolved. 
Question 3 d 
Please provide data on the duration of hospitalisation prior to baseline (median + IQR) per ordinal scale 
stratum at baseline. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 3d 
The MAH provided the median (Q1, Q3) duration of hospitalization prior to randomization was similar across 
the baseline ordinal score subgroups (Table 17).

The MAH provided an overall summary of AEs by baseline ordinal score and treatment group (Table 18). 
The  incidence  of  AEs  increased  with increasing baseline  disease  severity;  however,  within  each  baseline 
ordinal score subgroup, AE incidence was generally similar between the RDV and placebo groups.

The AEs reported in at least 5% of total participants by preferred term, baseline ordinal score, and treatment 
group are provided in Table 19. The incidence of AEs generally increased with increasing baseline disease 
severity; however, within each baseline ordinal score subgroup, AE incidence was generally similar between 
the  RDV  and  placebo  groups.  A  similar  trend  was  observed  in  an  analysis  of  study  drug-related  AEs  by 
preferred term, baseline ordinal score, and treatment group (data not shown).

An  overall  summary  of  renal  AEs  by  baseline  ordinal  score  is  provided  in  Table  20.  Renal impairment is 
associated with the underlying disease process, which is evident in the increase in renal AE incidence with 
increasing baseline disease severity. However, renal AE incidence was generally similar between treatment 
groups within the baseline ordinal score subgroup.

Ordinal Score and Treatment Group (As Treated Population) 
Renal  AEs  by  preferred  term,  baseline  ordinal  score,  and  treatment  group  are  summarized  in  Table  21. 
Most of the renal AEs observed occurred in similar percentages of participants between the RDV and placebo 
groups. It is notable that there is higher incidence of glomerular filtration rate decreased among placebo 
participants versus RDV participants in the Category 7 subgroup.

An overall summary of hepatic AEs by baseline ordinal score is provided in Table 22. The trend in hepatic 
AEs was similar to that observed for overall AEs. Incidence of hepatic AEs increased with increasing baseline 
disease  severity,  but  was  generally  similar  between  treatment  groups  within  the  baseline  ordinal  score 
subgroup. 
Table 22: CO-US-540-5776: Overall Summary of Treatment-Emergent Hepatic Adverse Events by Baseline 
Ordinal Score and Treatment Group (As Treated Population) 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH provided the requested key safety indices, including renal events, from the randomised NIAID-
ACTT1  study  for  patients  in  baseline  ordinal  scale  categories  6  and 7,  per  treatment  arm.  Based  on  the 
provided safety analyses, the safety in the subgroup of patients on IMV or ECMO was in general similar 
between the two groups.  
However, it has to be noted, that the numbers of study drug related AEs was generally low in the ACTT-1 
study,  which  is  not  surprising  as  the  unknown  disease,  the  variety  of  comedications  and  the  pandemic 
situation could seriously hamper the discern of the relationship to study drug. While the MAH concluded 
that there were no additional risks identified with the use of RDV in this patient population,  it has to be 
noted that there were more patients in category 7 with treatment emrérgent serious renal AEs and with 
treatment emergent renal AEs who discontinued the study drug in the RDV group compated to the control 
group. The results may be indicative of a negative trend in patients receiving IMV or ECMO at treatment 
initiation,  which  might  be  explained  by  an  increased  risk  due  to  longer  therapy  duration,  i.  e.  higher 
cumulative exposure. In this context it is worth noting that PRAC has started a review of a safety signal to 
assess  reports  of  acute  kidney  injury  in  some  patients  with  COVID-19  taking  Remdesivir.  Nevertheless, 
presented numbers of the ACTT-1 trial are too small to draw any conclusions on this finding. Finally, it is 
important to highlight that the assessement of the safety aspect of remdesivir is being very closely followed 
by the PRAC including also the safety signal on renal toxicity. Once the assessment is concluded, in case of 
any concern or finding the correspondant regulatory action will be taken.

MS1, MS2, MS3 and MS 4 fully support the Rapporteurs proposed restricted indication. 
MS5 and MS6 consider a restriction of the indication to specifically exclude patients on IMV/ECMO is not 
necessary.  A  warning  in  section  4.4,  stating  the  current  lack  of  benefit  in  patients  on  IMV/ECMO,  is 
considered to be sufficient. 
MS7 and MS8 do not support the proposed changes of the SmPC (neither for 4.1 nor for 4.4). 
12.  Request for supplementary information 
12.1.  Major objections 
Clinical aspects 
SOB  13,  considered  as  key  for  substantiation  of  the  therapeutic  indication  at  the  time  of  CMA,  did  not 
provide proof of a positive benefit/risk ratio of RDV in patients on IMV/ECMO at baseline. Therefore, therapy 
of patients on IMV/ECMO at the start of therapy should no longer be indicated for RDV. Consequentely, the 
indication should be restricted as follow (add underline to text): “Veklury is indicated for the treatment of 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and older with body weight 
at least 40 kg) with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen (low- or high-flow oxygen or non-invasive 
ventilation at start of treatment) (see section 5.1).”. 
12.2.  Other concerns 
Clinical aspects 
2.  The proposed table of the final Day-28 mortality data in section 5.1 of the SmPC (including mortality 
data by WHO score) is not endorsed, as only the final Day-28 mortality data relevant for the approved 
indication should be included in section 5.1. Information concerning ordinal scale 4 and 7 should be 
deleted. In addition, the propossed updates to the SmPC should be included now and not withing the 
renewal procedure.  
MAH responses: 
The MAH provided a new table with the correct data in SmPC Section 5.1 and an updated PI with the 
indication agreed by the CHMP:   
“Veklury is indicated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adults and adolescents 
(aged 12 years and older with body weight at least 40 kg) with pneumonia requiring supplemental 
oxygen (low- or high-flow oxygen or non-invasive ventilation at start of treatment) (see section 5.1).”. 
Therefore, all the issues are considered solved. 
Conclusion: 
 Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly (see above).

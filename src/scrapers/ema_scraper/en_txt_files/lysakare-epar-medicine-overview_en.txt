LysaKare (arginine / lysine) 
An overview of LysaKare and why it is authorised in the EU 
What is LysaKare and what is it used for? 
LysaKare is a medicine used to protect the kidneys from radiation damage during cancer treatment 
with a radioactive medicine called lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide.  
LysaKare is for use in adults and contains the active substances arginine and lysine. 
How is LysaKare used? 
LysaKare is given by infusion (drip) in to a vein over 4 hours. Infusion with LysaKare is started 
30 minutes before the patient is given lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide (also by infusion).  
Because LysaKare can cause nausea (feeling sick) and vomiting, patients will be given medicines to 
prevent nausea and vomiting before receiving LysaKare.  
LysaKare can only be obtained with a prescription and should only be given by a healthcare 
professional experienced in the use of radioactive medicines. For more information about using 
LysaKare, see the package leaflet or contact your doctor or pharmacist. 
How does LysaKare work? 
Radiation from lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide can cause damage when the medicine passes through 
tubules in the kidney. The active substances in LysaKare, arginine and lysine, interfere with the 
passage of lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide through these kidney tubules. As a result, the radioactive 
medicine leaves the body in the urine and the kidneys are exposed to less radiation.  
What benefits of LysaKare have been shown in studies? 
Because the use of arginine and lysine to protect the kidneys during this type of cancer treatment is 
well established, the company presented data from the scientific literature. These included data from 
over 1,200 cancer patients treated with lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide, which showed that arginine and 
lysine were effective at preventing kidney damage.

In another published study involving 229 patients, measurement of creatinine clearance (an indication 
of how well the kidneys are working) did not show kidney damage 14 months after patients were 
treated with arginine and lysine at the same time as lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide. 
What are the risks associated with LysaKare? 
The most common side effects with LysaKare (which may affect more than 1 in 10 people) are nausea 
and vomiting. LysaKare is also associated with hyperkalaemia (high blood potassium levels), but the 
frequency of this side effect is not known. Side effects with LysaKare are usually mild or moderate. 
LysaKare must not be given to patients with high levels of potassium in the blood if this has not been 
corrected before treatment. 
For the full list of side effects and restrictions with LysaKare, see the package leaflet. 
Why is LysaKare authorised in the EU? 
The use of arginine and lysine during treatment with lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide has been shown to 
reduce kidney damage and allow patients to be given an effective dose of radioactive treatment for 
their cancer. The main risk with LysaKare is a dangerous rise of blood potassium levels but this side 
effect can be managed if recognised and treated appropriately. Information on how to do this has been 
included in the product information. The European Medicines Agency therefore decided that LysaKare’s 
benefits are greater than its risks and it can be authorised for use in the EU. 
What measures are being taken to ensure the safe and effective use of 
LysaKare? 
Recommendations and precautions to be followed by healthcare professionals and patients for the safe 
and effective use of LysaKare have been included in the summary of product characteristics and the 
package leaflet. 
As for all medicines, data on the use of LysaKare are continuously monitored. Side effects reported 
with LysaKare are carefully evaluated and any necessary action taken to protect patients.

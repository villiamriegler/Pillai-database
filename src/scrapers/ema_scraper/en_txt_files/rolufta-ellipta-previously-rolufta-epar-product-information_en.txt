3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Inhalation powder, pre-dispensed (inhalation powder) 
White powder in a grey inhaler (Ellipta) with a light green mouthpiece cover and a dose counter. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Rolufta Ellipta is indicated as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms in adult 
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Posology 
The recommended dose is one inhalation once daily.  
It should be administered each day at the same time of the day to maintain bronchodilation. The 
maximum dose is one inhalation once daily. If a dose is missed the next dose should be inhaled at the 
usual time the next day. 
Special populations  
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required in patients 65 years of age or older (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Umeclidinium 
has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and should be used with caution (see 
section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of umeclidinium in the paediatric population (under 18 years of age) for the 
indication of COPD. 
Method of administration  
For inhalation use only. 
The following instructions for the 30-dose inhaler (30-day supply) also apply to the 7-dose inhaler 
(7-day supply). 
The inhaler is packaged in a tray containing a desiccant sachet, to reduce moisture. The desiccant 
sachet should be thrown away and it should not be opened, eaten or inhaled. 
The patient should be advised to not open the tray until they are ready to inhale a dose. 
If the inhaler cover is opened and closed without inhaling the medicinal product, the dose will be lost. 
The lost dose will be securely held inside the inhaler, but it will no longer be available to be inhaled. 
It is not possible to accidentally take extra medicinal product or a double dose in one inhalation. 
Instructions for use 
a) 
Prepare a dose 
Open the cover when ready to inhale a dose. The inhaler should not be shaken. 
Slide the cover down until a “click” is heard. The medicinal product is now ready to be inhaled. 
The dose counter counts down by 1 to confirm. If the dose counter does not count down as the “click” 
is heard, the inhaler will not deliver a dose and should be taken back to a pharmacist for advice. 
b) 
How to inhale the medicinal product 
The inhaler should be held away from the mouth breathing out as far as is comfortable. But not 
breathing out into the inhaler. 
The mouthpiece should be placed between the lips and the lips should then be closed firmly around it. 
The air vents should not be blocked with fingers during use. 
•  Inhale with one long, steady, deep breath in. This breath should be held in for as long as possible 
(at least 3-4 seconds). 
•  Remove the inhaler from the mouth. 
•  Breathe out slowly and gently. 
The medicinal product may not be tasted or felt, even when using the inhaler correctly. 
The mouthpiece of the inhaler may be cleaned using a dry tissue before closing the cover.

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Asthma 
Umeclidinium should not be used in patients with asthma since it has not been studied in this patient 
population. 
Paradoxical bronchospasm 
Administration of umeclidinium may produce paradoxical bronchospasm that may be life-threatening. 
If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, treatment should be discontinued immediately and alternative 
therapy instituted if necessary. 
Deterioration of disease 
Umeclidinium is intended for the maintenance treatment of COPD. It should not be used for the relief 
of acute symptoms, i.e. as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. Acute 
symptoms should be treated with an inhaled short-acting bronchodilator. Increasing use of short-acting 
bronchodilators to relieve symptoms indicates deterioration of control. In the event of deterioration of 
COPD during treatment with umeclidinium, a re-evaluation of the patient and of the COPD treatment 
regimen should be undertaken.  
Cardiovascular effects 
Cardiovascular effects, such as cardiac arrhythmias e.g. atrial fibrillation and tachycardia, may be seen 
after the administration of muscarinic receptor antagonists including umeclidinium (see section 4.8). 
Patients with clinically significant uncontrolled cardiovascular disease were excluded from clinical 
studies. Therefore, umeclidinium should be used with caution in patients with severe cardiovascular 
disorders, particularly cardiac arrhythmias. 
Antimuscarinic activity  
Due to its antimuscarinic activity, umeclidinium should be used with caution in patients with urinary 
retention or with narrow-angle glaucoma. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose 
intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not use this medicinal 
product. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Clinically significant interactions mediated by umeclidinium at clinical doses are considered unlikely 
due to the low plasma concentrations achieved after inhaled dosing. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other antimuscarinics  
Co-administration of umeclidinium with other long acting muscarinic antagonists or medicinal 
products containing this active substance has not been studied and is not recommended as it may 
potentiate known inhaled muscarinic antagonist adverse reactions. 
Metabolic and transporter based interactions  
Umeclidinium is a substrate of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). The steady-state pharmacokinetics 
of umeclidinium were assessed in healthy volunteers lacking CYP2D6 (poor metabolisers). No effect 
on umeclidinium AUC or Cmax was observed at a dose 4-fold higher than the therapeutic dose. An 
approximately 1.3-fold increase in umeclidinium AUC was observed at an 8-fold higher dose with no 
effect on umeclidinium Cmax. Based on the magnitude of these changes, no clinically relevant 
interaction is expected when umeclidinium is co-administered with CYP2D6 inhibitors or when 
administered to subjects genetically deficient in CYP2D6 activity (poor metabolisers). 
Umeclidinium is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter. The effect of the moderate P-gp 
inhibitor verapamil (240 mg once daily) on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of umeclidinium was 
assessed in healthy volunteers. No effect of verapamil was observed on umeclidinium Cmax. An 
approximately 1.4-fold increase in umeclidinium AUC was observed. Based on the magnitude of these 
changes, no clinically relevant interaction is expected when umeclidinium is co-administered with P-
gp inhibitors. 
Other medicinal products for COPD 
Although no formal in vivo interaction studies have been performed, inhaled umeclidinium has been 
used concomitantly with other COPD medicinal products including short and long acting 
sympathomimetic bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids without clinical evidence of 
interactions. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of umeclidinium in pregnant women. Animal 
studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see 
section 5.3). 
Umeclidinium should be used during pregnancy only if the expected benefit to the mother justifies the 
potential risk to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether umeclidinium is excreted in human milk. A risk to breastfed newborns/infants 
cannot be excluded.  
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue Rolufta Ellipta 
therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the 
woman. 
Fertility 
There are no data on the effects of umeclidinium on human fertility. Animal studies indicate no effects 
of umeclidinium on fertility.

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Umeclidinium has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions are nasopharyngitis (6%) and upper respiratory tract 
infection (5%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The safety profile of umeclidinium was evaluated in patients with COPD who received doses of 
55 micrograms or greater for up to one year. This includes patients who received the recommended 
dose of 55 micrograms once daily. 
The frequencies assigned to the adverse reactions identified in the table below include crude incidence 
rates observed from efficacy studies, the long-term safety study (which involved patients who received 
umeclidinium), post-marketing studies and spontaneous reporting. 
The frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); 
common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1 000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000); very rare 
(<1/10 000) and not known (cannot be estimated from available data).

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.  
4.9  Overdose  
An overdose of umeclidinium will likely produce signs and symptoms consistent with the known 
inhaled muscarinic antagonist adverse reactions (e.g. dry mouth, visual accommodation disturbances 
and tachycardia). 
If overdose occurs, the patient should be treated supportively with appropriate monitoring as 
necessary. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, anticholinergics, ATC code: 
R03BB07  
Mechanism of action 
Umeclidinium is a long acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (also referred to as an anticholinergic). It 
is a quinuclidine derivative that is a muscarinic receptor antagonist with activity across multiple 
muscarinic cholinergic receptor subtypes. Umeclidinium exerts its bronchodilatory activity by 
competitively inhibiting the binding of acetylcholine with muscarinic cholinergic receptors on airway 
smooth muscle. It demonstrates slow reversibility at the human M3 muscarinic receptor subtype in 
vitro and a long duration of action in vivo when administered directly to the lungs in pre-clinical 
models. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
In a Phase III, 6-month study (DB2113373) umeclidinium provided a clinically meaningful 
improvement over placebo in lung function (as measured by forced expiratory volume in 1 second 
[FEV1]) over 24 hours following once daily administration, which was evident at 30 minutes following 
administration of the first dose (improvement over placebo by 102 mL, p<0.001*). The mean peak 
improvements in FEV1 within the first 6 hours following dosing relative to placebo were 130 mL 
(p<0.001*) at week 24. There was no evidence for tachyphylaxis in the effect of umeclidinium over 
time. 
*A step-down statistical testing procedure was used in this study and this comparison was below a comparison 
that did not achieve statistical significance. Therefore, statistical significance on this comparison cannot be 
inferred. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cardiac electrophysiology  
The effect of umeclidinium 500 micrograms (pre-dispensed) on the QT interval was evaluated in a 
placebo- and moxifloxacin-controlled QT trial of 103 healthy volunteers. Following repeat doses of 
umeclidinium 500 micrograms once daily for 10 days, no clinically relevant effect on prolongation of 
QT interval (corrected using the Fridericia method) or effects on heart rate were observed. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The clinical efficacy of umeclidinium administered once daily was evaluated in 904 adult patients who 
received umeclidinium or placebo from two pivotal Phase III clinical studies with a clinical diagnosis 
of COPD; a 12-week study (AC4115408) and a 24-week study (DB2113373). 
Pivotal efficacy studies: 
Effects on lung function 
In both of the pivotal 12-week and 24-week studies, umeclidinium demonstrated statistically 
significant and clinically meaningful improvements in lung function (as defined by change from 
baseline trough FEV1 at week 12 and week 24 respectively, which was the primary efficacy endpoint 
in each study) compared with placebo (see Table 1). The bronchodilatory effects with umeclidinium 
compared with placebo were evident after the first day of treatment in both studies and were 
maintained over the 12-week and 24-week treatment periods. 
There was no attenuation of the bronchodilator effect over time.

Umeclidinium demonstrated a statistically significant greater improvement from baseline in weighted 
mean FEV1 over 0-6 hours post-dose at week 12 compared with placebo (166 mL, p<0.001) in the 
12-Week pivotal study. Umeclidinium demonstrated a greater improvement from baseline in weighted 
mean FEV1 over 0-6 hours post-dose at week 24 compared with placebo (150 mL, p<0.001*) in the 
24-week pivotal study. 
Symptomatic outcomes 
Breathlessness: 
In the 12-week study, a statistically significant improvement compared with placebo in the TDI focal 
score at week 12 was not demonstrated for umeclidinium (1.0 units, p=0.05). A statistically significant 
improvement compared with placebo in the TDI focal score at week 24 was demonstrated for 
umeclidinium (1.0 units, p<0.001) in the 24-week study. 
*A step-down statistical testing procedure was used in this study and this comparison was below a comparison 
that did not achieve statistical significance. Therefore, statistical significance on this comparison cannot be 
inferred. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The proportion of patients who responded with at least the minimum clinically important difference 
(MCID) of 1 unit TDI focal score at week 12 was greater for umeclidinium (38%) compared with 
placebo (15%) in the 12-week study. Similarly, a greater proportion of patients achieved ≥1 unit TDI 
focal score for umeclidinium (53%) compared with placebo (41%) at week 24 in the 24-week study. 
Health-related quality of life: 
Umeclidinium also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in health-related quality of 
life measured using the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) as indicated by a reduction in 
SGRQ total score at week 12 compared with placebo (-7.90 units, p<0.001) in the 12-week study. A 
greater improvement compared with placebo in the change from baseline in SGRQ total score at week 
24 was demonstrated for umeclidinium (-4.69 units, p<0.001∗) in the 24-week study. 
The proportion of patients who responded with at least the MCID in SGRQ score (defined as a 
decrease of 4 units from baseline) at week 12 was greater for umeclidinium 55 micrograms (44%) 
compared with placebo (26%) in the 12-week study. Similarly, a greater proportion of patients 
achieved at least the MCID for umeclidinium at week 24 (44%) compared with placebo (34%) in the 
24-week study.  
COPD exacerbations 
In the 24-week placebo-controlled study in patients with symptomatic COPD, umeclidinium reduced 
the risk of a moderate/severe COPD exacerbation by 40% compared with placebo (analysis of time to 
first exacerbation; Hazard Ratio 0.6; 95% CI: 0.4, 1.0, p=0.035*). The probability of having an 
exacerbation in patients receiving umeclidinium at Week 24 was 8.9% compared with 13.7% for 
placebo. These studies were not specifically designed to evaluate the effect of treatments on COPD 
exacerbations and patients were withdrawn from the study if an exacerbation occurred. 
Use of rescue medicinal product 
In the 12-week study, umeclidinium statistically significantly reduced the use of rescue medication 
with salbutamol compared with placebo (on average a reduction of 0.7 puffs per day over weeks 1-12, 
p=0.025) and demonstrated a higher percentage of days when no rescue medication was needed (on 
average 46.3%) compared with placebo (on average 35.2%; no formal statistical analysis was 
performed on this endpoint). In the 24-week study treatment with umeclidinium, the mean (SD) 
change from baseline in the number of puffs of rescue salbutamol over the 24-week treatment period 
was -1.4 (0.20) for placebo and -1.7 (0.16) for umeclidinium (Difference = -0.3; 95% CI: -0.8, 0.2, 
p=0.276). Patients receiving umeclidinium had a higher percentage of days when no rescue medication 
was needed (on average 31.1%) compared with placebo (on average 21.7%). No formal statistical 
testing was performed on this endpoint. 
Supporting efficacy studies 
In a randomised, double-blind, 52-week study (CTT116855, IMPACT) of 10,355 adult patients with 
symptomatic COPD and a history of 1 or more moderate or severe exacerbations within the prior 12 
months, treatment with fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol (FF/UMEC/VI 
92/55/22 micrograms) once daily as a single inhaler was compared with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 
(FF/VI 92/22 micrograms) once daily as a single inhaler. The primary endpoint was annual rate of on-
treatment moderate and severe exacerbations in subjects treated with FF/UMC/VI compared with 
FF/VI. The mean annual rate of exacerbations was 0.91 and 1.07 for FF/UMEC/VI and FF/VI 
respectively (Rate Ratio: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.80, 0.90; p<0.001). 
At week 52, a statistically significant improvement in the least-squares (LS) mean change from 
baseline in trough FEV1 was observed for FF/UMEC/VI compared with FF/VI (mean change: +94 mL 
vs. -3 mL; treatment difference: 97 mL; 95% CI: 85, 109; p<0.001). 
*A step-down statistical testing procedure was used in this study and this comparison was below a comparison 
that did not achieve statistical significance. Therefore, statistical significance on this comparison cannot be 
inferred. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In two 12-week, placebo controlled studies (200109 and 200110), the addition of umeclidinium to 
fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (FF/VI) (92/22 micrograms) once daily in adult patients with a clinical 
diagnosis of COPD, resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in the 
primary endpoint of trough FEV1 at Day 85 compared to placebo plus FF/VI (124 mL 95% CI: 93, 
154; p<0.001 and 122 mL 95% CI: 91, 152; p<0.001). 
Improvements in lung function were supported with reductions in use of salbutamol over weeks 1-12 
(-0.4 puffs per day (95% CI: -0.7, -0.2; p<0.001) and -0.3 puffs per day (95% CI: -0.5, -0.1; p=0.003) 
compared to placebo plus FF/VI but improvements in SGRQ at week 12 were not statistically 
significant (200109) or clinically relevant (200109 and 200110). The short duration of these two 
studies and limited number of exacerbation events, preclude any conclusion regarding additional effect 
of umeclidinium on COPD exacerbation rate. 
No new adverse drug reactions were identified with the addition of umeclidinium to FF/VI in these 
studies. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Rolufta Ellipta in all subsets of the paediatric population in COPD (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following inhaled administration of umeclidinium in healthy volunteers, Cmax occurred at 5 to 
15 minutes. The absolute bioavailability of inhaled umeclidinium was on average 13% of the dose, 
with negligible contribution from oral absorption. Following repeat dosing of inhaled umeclidinium, 
steady state was achieved within 7 to 10 days with 1.5 to 1.8-fold accumulation. 
Distribution 
Following intravenous administration to healthy subjects, the mean volume of distribution was 86 
litres. In vitro plasma protein binding in human plasma was on average 89%. 
Biotransformation 
In vitro studies showed that umeclidinium is principally metabolised by cytochrome P450 2D6 
(CYP2D6) and is a substrate for the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter. The primary metabolic routes 
for umeclidinium are oxidative (hydroxylation, O-dealkylation) followed by conjugation 
(glucuronidation, etc), resulting in a range of metabolites with either reduced pharmacological activity 
or for which the pharmacological activity has not been established. Systemic exposure to the 
metabolites is low. 
Elimination 
Plasma clearance following intravenous administration was 151 litres/hour. Following intravenous 
administration, approximately 58% of the administered radiolabelled dose (or 73% of the recovered 
radioactivity) was excreted in faeces by 192 hours post-dose. Urinary elimination accounted for 22% 
of the administered radiolabelled dose by 168 hours (27% of recovered radioactivity). The excretion of 
the material in the faeces following intravenous dosing indicated secretion into the bile. Following oral 
administration to healthy male subjects, total radioactivity was excreted primarily in faeces (92% of 
the administered radiolabelled dose or 99% of the recovered radioactivity) by 168 hours post-dose. 
Less than 1% of the orally administered dose (1% of recovered radioactivity) was excreted in urine, 
suggesting negligible absorption following oral administration. Umeclidinium plasma elimination 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
half-life following inhaled dosing for 10 days averaged 19 hours, with 3% to 4% active substance 
excreted unchanged in urine at steady-state. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that pharmacokinetics of umeclidinium are similar 
between COPD patients 65 years and older and those younger than 65 years of age. 
Renal impairment 
Subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) showed no evidence of an 
increase in systemic exposure to umeclidinium (Cmax and AUC), and no evidence of altered protein 
binding between subjects with severe renal impairment and healthy volunteers. 
Hepatic impairment 
Subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) showed no evidence of an increase 
in systemic exposure to umeclidinium (Cmax and AUC), and no evidence of altered protein binding 
between subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and healthy volunteers. Umeclidinium has not 
been evaluated in subjects with severe hepatic impairment. 
Other special populations 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that no dose adjustment is required for umeclidinium 
based on the effect of age, race, gender, inhaled corticosteroid use or weight. A study in CYP2D6 poor 
metabolisers showed no evidence of a clinically significant effect of CYP2D6 genetic polymorphism 
on systemic exposure to umeclidinium. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. In non-clinical studies 
with umeclidinium, findings were those typically associated with the primary pharmacology of 
muscarinic receptor antagonists and/or local irritancy.  
Toxicity to reproduction 
Umeclidinium was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits. In a pre- and post-natal study, subcutaneous 
administration of umeclidinium to rats resulted in lower maternal body weight gain and food 
consumption and slightly decreased pre-weaning pup body weights in dams given 
180 micrograms/kg/day dose (approximately 80-times the human clinical exposure of umeclidinium 
55 micrograms, based on AUC).

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Rolufta Ellipta is and what it is used for 
What Rolufta Ellipta is 
Rolufta Ellipta contains the active substance umeclidinium (as bromide), which belongs to a group of 
medicines called bronchodilators. 
What Rolufta Ellipta is used for 
This medicine is used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults. COPD is a 
long-term condition in which the airways and air-sacs in the lungs gradually become blocked or 
damaged, leading to breathing difficulties that slowly get worse. Difficulties in breathing is added to 
by tightening of the muscles around the airways, which narrows the airways and so restricts the flow 
of air. 
This medicine blocks the tightening of these muscles, making it easier for air to get in and out of the 
lungs. When used regularly, it can help control your breathing difficulties and reduce the effects of 
COPD on your everyday life. 
Rolufta Ellipta should not be used to relieve a sudden attack of breathlessness or wheezing. 
If you get this sort of attack you must use a quick-acting reliever inhaler (such as salbutamol). If you 
do not have a quick-acting inhaler contact your doctor. 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you use Rolufta Ellipta 
Do not use Rolufta Ellipta:  
- 
if you are allergic to umeclidinium or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you think the above applies to you, do not use this medicine until you have checked with your 
doctor. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor before using Rolufta Ellipta: 
-  if you have asthma (Do not use Rolufta Ellipta to treat asthma) 
-  if you have heart problems 
-  if you have an eye problem called narrow-angle glaucoma 
-  if you have an enlarged prostate, difficulty passing urine or a blockage in your bladder 
-  if you have severe liver problems 
Check with your doctor if you think any of these may apply to you. 
Immediate breathing difficulties 
If you get tightness of the chest, coughing, wheezing or breathlessness immediately after using your 
Rolufta Ellipta inhaler: 
stop using this medicine and seek medical help immediately, as you may have a serious condition 
called paradoxical bronchospasm. 
Eye problems during treatment with Rolufta Ellipta 
If you get eye pain or discomfort, temporary blurring of vision, visual halos or coloured images in 
association with red eyes during treatment with Rolufta Ellipta:  
stop using this medicine and seek medical help immediately, these may be signs of an acute attack 
of narrow-angle glaucoma. 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children or adolescents below the age of 18 years. 
Other medicines and Rolufta Ellipta

medicines. If you are not sure what your medicine contains talk to your doctor or pharmacist. 
In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other long-acting medicines similar to 
this medicine for breathing problems, e.g. tiotropium. Do not use Rolufta Ellipta together with these 
other medicines.

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure.  
The recommended dose is one inhalation every day at the same time of day. You only need to inhale 
once a day because the effect of this medicine lasts for 24 hours. 
Do not use more than your doctor tells you to use. 
Use Rolufta Ellipta regularly 
It is very important that you use Rolufta Ellipta every day, as instructed by your doctor. This will help 
to keep you free of symptoms throughout the day and night. 
Do not use this medicine to relieve a sudden attack of breathlessness or wheezing. If you get this 
sort of attack you must use a quick-acting reliever inhaler (such as salbutamol).

using your quick-acting inhaler more often:  
contact your doctor as soon as possible. 
If you use more Rolufta Ellipta than you should

immediately as you may need medical attention. If possible, show them the inhaler, the package or 
this leaflet. You may notice that your heart is beating faster than usual, you have visual disturbances or 
have a dry mouth. 
If you forget to use Rolufta Ellipta  
Do not inhale a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Just inhale your next dose at the usual 
time.  
If you become wheezy or breathless, use your quick-acting inhaler (such as salbutamol), then seek 
medical advice. 
If you stop using Rolufta Ellipta 
Use this medicine for as long as your doctor recommends. It will only be effective as long as you are 
using it. Do not stop unless your doctor advises you to, even if you feel better, as your symptoms may 
get worse. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Step-by-step instructions for use 
What is the Ellipta inhaler? 
The first time you use Rolufta Ellipta you do not need to check that the inhaler is working 
properly; it contains previously measured doses and is ready to use straight away. 
Your Rolufta Ellipta inhaler carton contains 
Tray lid 
Inhaler 
Desiccant 
Tray 
Carton 
This leaflet 
The inhaler is packaged in a tray. Do not open the tray until you are ready to start using 
your new inhaler. When you are ready to use your inhaler, peel back the lid to open the tray. 
The tray contains a desiccant sachet, to reduce moisture. Throw this desiccant sachet away – do 
not open, eat or inhale it.  
Desiccant 
When you take the inhaler out of its tray, it will be in the ‘closed’ position. Do not open the 
inhaler until you are ready to inhale a dose of medicine. When the tray is opened, write the 
“Discard by” date on the inhaler label in the space provided. The “Discard by” date is 6 weeks 
from the date you opened the tray. After this date the inhaler should no longer be used. The tray 
can be discarded after first opening.

If stored in a refrigerator, allow the inhaler to return to room temperature for at least one hour 
before use. 
The step-by-step instructions for use of the Ellipta inhaler provided below can be used for either 
the 30-dose inhaler (30-day supply) or the 7-dose inhaler (7-day supply). 
1) Read this before you start 
If you open and close the cover without inhaling the medicine, you will lose the dose.  
The lost dose will be securely held inside the inhaler, but it will no longer be available. 
It is not possible to accidentally take extra medicine or a double dose in one inhalation. 
2) Prepare a dose 
Wait to open the cover until you are ready to inhale your dose.  
Do not shake the inhaler. 
•  Slide the cover down until you hear a “click”. 
Your medicine is now ready to be inhaled. 
The dose counter counts down by 1 to confirm. 
• 
If the dose counter does not count down as you hear the “click”, the inhaler will not 
deliver medicine.  
Take it back to your pharmacist for advice.

3) Inhale your medicine  
•  While holding the inhaler away from your mouth, breathe out as far as is comfortable.  
Do not breathe out into the inhaler. 
•  Put the mouthpiece between your lips, and close your lips firmly around it. 
Do not block the air vent with your fingers. 
Your lips fit over the 
contoured shape of the 
mouthpiece for inhaling. 
Do not block the air vent 
with your fingers. 
• 
• 
• 
Take one long, steady, deep breath in. Hold this breath in for as long as possible (at least 
3-4 seconds). 
Remove the inhaler from your mouth. 
Breathe out slowly and gently. 
You may not be able to taste or feel the medicine, even when you are using the inhaler correctly. 
If you want to clean the mouthpiece, use a dry tissue, before you close the cover. 
4) Close the inhaler 
Slide the cover upwards as far as it will go, to cover the mouthpiece.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Hexyon (DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib) is indicated for primary and booster vaccination of infants and toddlers 
from six weeks of age against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis and invasive 
diseases caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). 
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Primary vaccination: 
The primary vaccination consists of 2 doses (with an interval of at least 8 weeks) or 3 doses (with an 
interval of at least 4 weeks) in accordance with the official recommendations. 
All vaccination schedules including the WHO Expanded Program on Immunisation (EPI) at 6, 10, 14 
weeks of age can be used whether or not a dose of hepatitis B vaccine has been given at birth. 
Where a dose of hepatitis B vaccine is given at birth; 
-  Hexyon can be used for supplementary doses of hepatitis B vaccine from the age of 6 weeks. If 
a second dose of hepatitis B vaccine is required before this age, monovalent hepatitis B vaccine 
should be used. 
-  Hexyon can be used for a mixed hexavalent/pentavalent/hexavalent combined vaccine 
immunisation schedule in accordance with official recommendations. 
Booster vaccination: 
After a 2-dose primary vaccination with Hexyon, a booster dose must be given. 
After a 3-dose primary vaccination with Hexyon, a booster dose should be given. 
Booster doses should be given at least 6 months after the last priming dose and in accordance with the 
official recommendations. As a minimum, a dose of Hib vaccine must be administered. 
In addition: 
In the absence of hepatitis B vaccination at birth, it is necessary to give a hepatitis B vaccine booster 
dose. Hexyon can be considered for the booster. 
When a hepatitis B vaccine is given at birth, after a 3-dose primary vaccination, Hexyon or a 
pentavalent DTaP-IPV/Hib vaccine can be administered for the booster. 
Hexyon may be used as a booster in individuals who have previously been vaccinated with another 
hexavalent vaccine or a pentavalent DTaP-IPV/Hib vaccine associated with a monovalent hepatitis B 
vaccine. 
WHO-EPI schedule (6, 10, 14 weeks): 
After a WHO-EPI schedule, a booster dose should be given 
-  As a minimum, a booster dose of polio vaccine should be given 
-  In absence of hepatitis B vaccine at birth, a hepatitis B vaccine booster must be given 
-  Hexyon can be considered for the booster 
Other paediatric population: 
The safety and efficacy of Hexyon in infants less than 6 weeks of age have not been established. No 
data are available. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No data are available in older children (see sections 4.8 and 5.1) 
Method of administration  
Immunisation must be carried out by intramuscular (IM) injection. The recommended injection sites 
are the antero-lateral area of the upper thigh (preferred site) or the deltoid muscle in older children 
(possibly from 15 months of age). 
For instructions on handling, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
History of an anaphylactic reaction after a previous administration of Hexyon. 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, to trace 
residuals (glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, neomycin, streptomycin and polymyxin B), to any pertussis 
vaccine, or after previous administration of Hexyon or a vaccine containing the same components or 
constituents. 
Vaccination with Hexyon is contraindicated if the individual has experienced an encephalopathy of 
unknown aetiology, occurring within 7 days following prior vaccination with a pertussis containing 
vaccine (whole cell or acellular pertussis vaccines). 
In these circumstances pertussis vaccination should be discontinued and the vaccination course should 
be continued with diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis and Hib vaccines. 
Pertussis vaccine should not be administered to individuals with uncontrolled neurologic disorder or 
uncontrolled epilepsy until treatment for the condition has been established, the condition has 
stabilised and the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Hexyon will not prevent disease caused by pathogens other than Corynebacterium diphtheriae, 
Clostridium tetani, Bordetella pertussis, hepatitis B virus, poliovirus or Haemophilus influenzae 
type b. However, it can be expected that hepatitis D will be prevented by immunisation as hepatitis D 
(caused by the delta agent) does not occur in the absence of hepatitis B infection. 
Hexyon will not protect against hepatitis infection caused by other agents such as hepatitis A, hepatitis 
C and hepatitis E or by other liver pathogens. 
Because of the long incubation period of hepatitis B, it is possible for unrecognised hepatitis B 
infection to be present at the time of vaccination. The vaccine may not prevent hepatitis B infection in 
such cases. 
Hexyon does not protect against infectious diseases caused by other types of Haemophilus influenzae 
or against meningitis of other origins. 
Prior to immunisation 
Immunisation should be postponed in individuals suffering from moderate to severe acute febrile 
illness or infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not result in the 
deferral of vaccination. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Vaccination should be preceded by a review of the person’s medical history (in particular previous 
vaccinations and possible adverse reactions). The administration of Hexyon must be carefully 
considered in individuals who have a history of serious or severe reactions within 48 hours following 
administration of a vaccine containing similar components. 
Before the injection of any biological medicinal product, the person responsible for administration 
must take all precautions known for the prevention of allergic or any other reactions. As with all 
injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available 
in case of an anaphylactic reaction following administration of the vaccine. 
If any of the following events are known to have occurred after receiving any pertussis containing 
vaccine, the decision to give further doses of pertussis containing vaccine should be carefully 
considered: 
• 
• 
Temperature of ≥40°C within 48 hours of vaccination not due to another identifiable cause; 
Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode) within 48 hours of 
vaccination; 
Persistent, inconsolable crying lasting ≥3 hours, occurring within 48 hours of vaccination; 
Convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of vaccination. 
• 
• 
There may be some circumstances, such as high incidence of pertussis, when the potential benefits 
outweigh possible risks. 
A history of febrile convulsions, a family history of convulsions or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome 
(SIDS) do not constitute a contraindication for the use of Hexyon. Individuals with a history of febrile 
convulsions should be closely followed up as such adverse events may occur within 2 to 3 days post 
vaccination. 
If Guillain-Barré syndrome or brachial neuritis has occurred following receipt of prior vaccine 
containing tetanus toxoid, the decision to give any vaccine containing tetanus toxoid should be based 
on careful consideration of the potential benefits and possible risks, such as whether or not the primary 
vaccination has been completed. Vaccination is usually justified for individuals whose primary 
vaccination is incomplete (i.e. fewer than three doses have been received). 
The immunogenicity of the vaccine may be reduced by immunosuppressive treatment or 
immunodeficiency. It is recommended to postpone vaccination until the end of such treatment or 
disease. Nevertheless, vaccination of individuals with chronic immunodeficiency such as HIV 
infection is recommended even if the antibody response may be limited. 
Special populations 
Immunogenicity data are available for 105 preterm infants. These data support the use of Hexyon in 
preterm infants. As expected in preterm infants, lower immune response has been observed for some 
antigens, when indirectly compared to term infants, although seroprotective levels have been achieved 
(see section 5.1). No safety data were collected in preterm infants (born ≤37 weeks of gestation) in 
clinical trials. 
The potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48 to 72 hours should be 
considered when administering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants (born ≤28 
weeks of gestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. As the 
benefit of vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or delayed. 
Immune responses to the vaccine have not been studied in the context of genetic polymorphism. 
In individuals with chronic renal failure, an impaired hepatitis B response is observed and 
administration of additional doses of hepatitis B vaccine should be considered according to the 
antibody level against hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBsAg). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Immunogenicity data in HIV-exposed infants (infected and uninfected) showed that Hexyon is 
immunogenic in the potentially immunodeficient population of HIV-exposed infants whatever their 
HIV status at birth (see section 5.1). No specific safety concern was observed in this population. 
Precautions for use 
Do not administer by intravascular, intradermal or subcutaneous injection. 
As with all injectable vaccines, the vaccine must be administered with caution to individuals with 
thrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular 
administration. 
Syncope can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle 
injection. Procedures should be in place to prevent falling and injury and to manage syncope. 
Interference with laboratory testing 
Since the Hib capsular polysaccharide antigen is excreted in the urine, a positive urine test can be 
observed within 1 to 2 weeks following vaccination. Other tests should be performed in order to 
confirm Hib infection during this period. 
Hexyon contains phenylalanine, potassium and sodium 
Hexyon contains 85 micrograms phenylalanine in each 0.5-mL dose. Phenylalanine may be harmful 
for individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds up 
because the body cannot remove it properly. 
Hexyon contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) and less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, 
that is to say essentially “potassium-free” and “sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Hexyon can be administered simultaneously with a pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine, 
measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) and varicella-containing vaccines, rotavirus vaccines, a 
meningococcal C conjugate vaccine or a meningococcal group A, C, W-135 and Y conjugate vaccine, 
as no clinically relevant interference in the antibody response to each of the antigens has been shown. 
If co-administration with another vaccine is considered, immunisation should be carried out on 
separate injection sites. 
Hexyon must not be mixed with any other vaccines or other parenterally administered medicinal 
products. 
No significant clinical interaction with other treatments or biological products has been reported 
except in the case of immunosuppressive therapy (see section 4.4). 
Interference with laboratory testing: see section 4.4. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Not applicable. This vaccine is not intended for administration to women of child-bearing age. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Not applicable.

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
In clinical studies in individuals who received Hexyon, the most frequently reported reactions include 
injection-site pain, irritability, crying, and injection-site erythema.  
Slightly higher solicited reactogenicity was observed after the first dose compared to subsequent 
doses. 
The safety of Hexyon in children over 24 months of age has not been studied in clinical trials.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Extensive limb swelling: Large injection-site reactions (>50 mm), including extensive limb swelling 
from the injection site beyond one or both joints, have been reported in children. These reactions start 
within 24-72 hours after vaccination, may be associated with erythema, warmth, tenderness or pain at 
the injection site and resolve spontaneously within 3-5 days. The risk appears to be dependent on the 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
number of prior doses of acellular pertussis containing vaccine, with a greater risk following the 4th 
dose. 
Potential adverse events (i.e. adverse events that have been reported with other vaccines containing 
one or more of the components or constituents of Hexyon and not directly with Hexyon) 
Nervous system disorders 
- Brachial neuritis and Guillain-Barré Syndrome have been reported after administration of a tetanus 
toxoid-containing vaccine 
- Peripheral neuropathy (polyradiculoneuritis, facial paralysis), optic neuritis, central nervous system 
demyelination (multiple sclerosis) have been reported after administration of a hepatitis B antigen-
containing vaccine 
- Encephalopathy/encephalitis 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders 
Apnoea in very premature infants (≤28 weeks of gestation) (see section 4.4) 
General disorders and administration site conditions 
Oedematous reaction affecting one or both lower limbs may occur following vaccination with 
Haemophilus influenzae type b-containing vaccines. If this reaction occurs, it is mainly after primary 
injections and within the first few hours following vaccination. Associated symptoms may include 
cyanosis, redness, transient purpura, and severe crying. All events should resolve spontaneously 
without sequel within 24 hours. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
No cases of overdose have been reported.

Immune responses to Hib and pertussis antigens after 2 doses at 2 and 4 months of age 
The immune responses to Hib (PRP) and pertussis antigens (PT and FHA) were evaluated after 2 
doses in a subset of subjects receiving Hexyon (N=148) at 2, 4, 6 months of age. The immune 
responses to PRP, PT and FHA antigens one month after 2 doses given at 2 and 4 months of age were 
similar to those observed one month after a 2-dose priming given at 3 and 5 months of age:  
-  anti-PRP titers ≥0.15 µg/mL were observed in 73.0% of individuals,  
-  anti-PT vaccine response in 97.9% of individuals, 
-  anti-FHA vaccine response in 98.6% of individuals. 
Persistence of immune response 
Studies on long-term persistence of vaccine induced antibodies following varying infant / toddler 
primary series and following Hepatitis B vaccine given at birth or not have shown maintenance of 
levels above the recognized protective levels or antibody thresholds for the vaccine antigens (see 
Table 3).

LLOQ value for anti-PT and anti-FHA is 2 EU/mL 
The persistence of the immune responses against the hepatitis B component of Hexyon was evaluated 
in infants primed from two different schedules.  
For a 2-dose primary infant series at 3 and 5 months of age without hepatitis B at birth, followed by a 
toddler booster at 11-12 months of age, 53.8% of children were seroprotected (anti-HBsAg 
≥10 mIU/mL) at 6 years of age, and 96.7% presented an anamnestic response after a challenge dose 
with a standalone Hepatitis B vaccine. 
For a primary series consisting of one dose of hepatitis B vaccine given at birth followed by a 3-dose 
infant series at 2, 4, and 6 months of age without a toddler booster, 49.3% of children were 
seroprotected (anti-HBsAg ≥10 mIU/mL) at 9 years of age, and 92.8% presented an anamnestic 
response after a challenge dose with a standalone Hepatitis B vaccine. 
These data support persisting immune memory induced in infants primed with Hexyon.

Immune responses to Hexyon in preterm infants 
Immune responses to Hexyon antigens in preterm (105) infants (born after a gestation period of 28 to 
36 weeks), including 90 infants born to women vaccinated with Tdap vaccine during pregnancy and 
15 to women not vaccinated during pregnancy, were evaluated following a 3-dose primary vaccination 
course at 2, 3, and 4 months of age, and a booster dose at 13 months of age. 
One month after primary vaccination, all subjects were seroprotected against diphtheria 
(≥0.01 IU/mL), tetanus (≥0.01 IU/mL), and poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 (≥8 (1/dilution)); 89.8% of 
subjects were seroprotected against hepatitis B (≥10 IU/mL) and 79.4% were seroprotected against 
Hib invasive diseases (≥0.15 µg/mL).  
One month after the booster dose, all subjects were seroprotected against diphtheria (≥0.1 IU/mL), 
tetanus (≥0.1 IU/mL), and poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 (≥8 (1/dilution)); 94.6% of subjects were 
seroprotected against hepatitis B (≥10 IU/mL) and 90.6% were seroprotected against Hib invasive 
diseases (≥1 µg/mL). 
Regarding pertussis, one month after primary vaccination 98.7% and 100% of subjects developed 
antibodies ≥8 EU/mL against PT and FHA antigens, respectively. One month after the booster dose, 
98.8% of subjects developed antibodies ≥8 EU/mL against both PT and FHA antigens. Pertussis 
antibody concentrations increased by 13-fold after primary vaccination and by 6- to 14-fold after the 
booster dose. 
Immune responses to Hexyon in infants born to women vaccinated with Tdap during pregnancy 
Immune responses to Hexyon antigens in term (109) and preterm (90) infants born to women 
vaccinated with Tdap vaccine during pregnancy (between 24 and 36 weeks of gestation) were 
evaluated following a 3-dose primary vaccination course at 2, 3, and 4 months of age, and a booster 
dose at 13 (preterm infants) or 15 (term infants) months of age.  
One month after primary vaccination, all subjects were seroprotected against diphtheria 
(≥0.01 IU/mL), tetanus (≥0.01 IU/mL), and poliovirus types 1 and 3 (≥8 (1/dilution)); 97.3% of 
subjects were seroprotected against poliovirus type 2 (≥8 (1/dilution)); 94.6% of subjects were 
seroprotected against hepatitis B (≥10 IU/mL) and 88.0% were seroprotected against Hib invasive 
diseases (≥0.15 µg/mL).  
One month after the booster dose, all subjects were seroprotected against diphtheria (≥0.1 IU/mL), 
tetanus (≥0.1 IU/mL), and poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 (≥8 (1/dilution)); 93.9% of subjects were 
seroprotected against hepatitis B (≥10 IU/mL) and 94.0% were seroprotected against Hib invasive 
diseases (≥1 µg/mL). 
Regarding pertussis, one month after primary vaccination 99.4% and 100% of subjects developed 
antibodies ≥8 EU/mL against PT and FHA antigens, respectively. One month after the booster dose, 
99.4% of subjects developed antibodies ≥8 EU/mL against both PT and FHA antigens. Pertussis 
antibody concentrations were increased by 5- to 9-fold after primary vaccination, and by 8- to 19-fold 
after the booster dose. 
Immune responses to Hexyon in HIV-exposed infants 
Immune responses to Hexyon antigens in 51 HIV-exposed infants (9 infected and 42 uninfected) were 
evaluated following a 3-dose primary vaccination course at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age, and a booster 
dose at 15 to 18 months of age.  
One month after primary vaccination, all infants were seroprotected against diphtheria (≥0.01 IU/mL), 
tetanus (≥0.01 IU/mL), poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 (≥8 (1/dilution), hepatitis B (≥10 IU/mL), and 
more than 97.6% for Hib invasive diseases (≥0.15 µg/mL).  
One month after the booster dose, all subjects were seroprotected against diphtheria (≥0.1 IU/mL), 
tetanus (≥0.1 IU/mL), poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 (≥8 (1/dilution), hepatitis B (≥10 IU/mL), and more 
than 96.6% for Hib invasive diseases (≥1 µg/mL). 
Regarding pertussis, one month after primary vaccination, 100% of subjects developed antibodies 
≥8 EU/mL against both PT and FHA antigens. One month after the booster dose, 100% of subjects 
developed antibodies ≥8 EU/mL against both PT and FHA antigens. Seroconversion rates defined as 
minimum 4-fold increase compared to pre-vaccination level (pre-dose 1) were 100% in the HIV-
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
exposed and infected group for anti-PT and anti-FHA; and 96.6% for anti-PT, and 89.7% for anti-FHA 
in the HIV-exposed and uninfected group. 
Efficacy and effectiveness in protecting against pertussis 
Vaccine efficacy of the acellular pertussis (aP) antigens contained in Hexyon against the most severe 
WHO-defined typical pertussis (≥21 days of paroxysmal cough) is documented in a randomised 
double-blind study among infants with a 3-dose primary series using a DTaP vaccine in a highly 
endemic country (Senegal). The need for a toddler booster dose was seen in this study. 
The long-term capability of the acellular pertussis (aP) antigens contained in Hexyon to reduce 
pertussis incidence and control pertussis disease in childhood has been demonstrated in a 10-year 
national pertussis surveillance on pertussis disease in Sweden with the pentavalent DTaP-IPV/Hib 
vaccine using a 3, 5, 12 months schedule. Results of long-term follow-up demonstrated a dramatic 
reduction of the pertussis incidence following the second dose regardless of the vaccine used. 
Effectiveness in protecting against Hib invasive disease 
The vaccine effectiveness against Hib invasive disease of DTaP and Hib combination vaccines 
(pentavalent and hexavalent including vaccines containing the Hib antigen from Hexyon) has been 
demonstrated in Germany via an extensive (over five years follow-up period) post-marketing 
surveillance study. The vaccine effectiveness was of 96.7% for the full primary series, and 98.5% for 
the booster dose (irrespective of priming). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional repeat dose toxicity and 
local tolerance studies. 
At the injection sites, chronic histological inflammatory changes were observed that are expected to 
have a slow recovery.

Contents of the pack and other information  
1.  What Hexyon is and what it is used for 
Hexyon (DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib) is a vaccine used to protect against infectious diseases. 
Hexyon helps to protect against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis and serious 
diseases caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b. Hexyon is given to children from six weeks of age. 
The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the bacteria 
and viruses that cause these different infections: 
• 
Diphtheria is an infectious disease that usually first affects the throat. In the throat, the infection 
causes pain and swelling that can lead to suffocation. The bacterium that causes the disease also 
makes a toxin (poison) that can damage the heart, kidneys, and nerves. 
Tetanus (often called lock jaw) is usually caused by the tetanus bacterium entering a deep 
wound. The bacterium makes a toxin (poison) that causes spasms of the muscles leading to 
inability to breathe and the possibility of suffocation. 
Pertussis (often called whooping cough) is a highly infectious illness that affects the airways. It 
causes severe coughing that may lead to problems with breathing. The coughing often has a 
“whooping” sound. The cough may last for one to two months or longer. Whooping cough can 
also cause ear infections, chest infections (bronchitis) that may last a long time, lung infections 
(pneumonia), fits, brain damage, and even death. 
Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus. It causes the liver to become swollen (inflamed). 
In some people, the virus can stay in the body for a long time and can eventually lead to serious 
liver problems, including liver cancer. 
Poliomyelitis (often just called polio) is caused by viruses that affect the nerves. It can lead to 
paralysis or muscle weakness most commonly of the legs. Paralysis of the muscles that control 
breathing and swallowing can be fatal. 
Haemophilus influenzae type b infections (often just called Hib) are serious bacterial infections 
and can cause meningitis (inflammation of the outer covering of the brain), which can lead to 
brain damage, deafness, epilepsy, or partial blindness. Infection can also cause inflammation 
and swelling of the throat leading to difficulties in swallowing and breathing. The infection can 
affect other parts of the body such as the blood, lungs, skin, bones, and joints.

Important information about the protection provided 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Hexyon will only help to prevent these diseases if they are caused by the bacteria or viruses 
targeted by the vaccine. Your child could get diseases with similar symptoms if they are caused 
by other bacteria or viruses. 
The vaccine does not contain any live bacteria or viruses and it cannot cause any of the 
infectious diseases against which it protects. 
This vaccine does not protect against infections caused by other types of Haemophilus 
influenzae nor against meningitis due to other micro-organisms. 
Hexyon will not protect against hepatitis infection caused by other agents such as hepatitis A, 
hepatitis C, and hepatitis E. 
Because symptoms of hepatitis B take a long time to develop, it is possible for unrecognised 
hepatitis B infection to be present at the time of vaccination. The vaccine may not prevent 
hepatitis B infection in such cases. 
As with any vaccine, Hexyon may not protect 100% of children who receive the vaccine. 
2.  What you need to know before Hexyon is given to your child 
To make sure that Hexyon is suitable for your child, it is important to talk to your doctor or nurse if 
any of the points below apply to your child. If there is anything you do not understand, ask your 
doctor, pharmacist, or nurse to explain. 
Do not use Hexyon if your child: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
has had respiratory disorder or swelling of the face (anaphylactic reaction) after administration 
of Hexyon. 
has had an allergic reaction 
- to the active substances, 
- to any of the excipients listed in section 6, 
- to glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, neomycin, streptomycin or polymyxin B, as these 
substances are used during the manufacturing process. 
- after previous administration of Hexyon or any other diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, 
poliomyelitis, hepatitis B, or Hib containing vaccines. 
suffered from a severe reaction affecting the brain (encephalopathy) within 7 days of a prior 
dose of a pertussis vaccine (acellular or whole cell pertussis). 
has an uncontrolled condition or severe illness affecting the brain and nervous system 
(uncontrolled neurologic disorder), or uncontrolled epilepsy. 
Warnings and precautions 
• 
• 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before vaccination if your child: 
• 
has a moderate or high temperature or an acute illness (e.g. fever, sore throat, cough, cold, or 
flu). Vaccination with Hexyon may need to be delayed until your child is better. 
has had any of the following events after receiving a pertussis vaccine, as the decision to give 
further doses of pertussis containing vaccine will need to be carefully considered: 
- fever of 40°C or above within 48 hours of vaccination not due to another identifiable 
cause. 
- collapse or shock-like state with hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode (drop in energy) 
within 48 hours of vaccination. 
- persistent, inconsolable crying lasting 3 hours or more, occurring within 48 hours of 
vaccination. 
- fits (convulsions) with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of vaccination. 
previously had Guillain-Barré syndrome (temporary inflammation of nerves causing pain, 
paralysis, and sensitivity disorders) or brachial neuritis (severe pain and decreased mobility of 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
arm and shoulder) after being given a vaccine containing tetanus toxoid (an inactivated form of 
tetanus toxin). In this case, the decision to give any further vaccine containing tetanus toxoid 
should be evaluated by your doctor. 
is having a treatment that suppresses her/his immune system (the body’s natural defenses) or 
has any disease that causes the weakness of the immune system. In these cases the immune 
response to the vaccine may be decreased. It is normally recommended to wait until the end of 
the treatment or disease before vaccinating. However children with long standing problems with 
their immune system such as HIV infection (AIDS) may still be given Hexyon, but the 
protection may not be as good as in children whose immune system is healthy. 
suffers from an acute or chronic illness including chronic renal insufficiency or failure (inability 
of the kidneys to work properly). 
suffers from any undiagnosed illness of the brain or epilepsy that is not controlled. Your doctor 
will assess the potential benefit offered by vaccination. 
has any problems with the blood that cause easy bruising or bleeding for a long time after minor 
cuts. Your doctor will advise you whether your child should have Hexyon. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore, tell your doctor or nurse 
your child fainted with a previous injection. 
Other medicines or vaccines and Hexyon 
Tell your doctor or nurse if your child is taking, has recently taken, or might take any other medicines 
or vaccines. 
Hexyon can be given at the same time as other vaccines such as pneumococcal vaccines, measles, 
mumps, rubella vaccines, varicella vaccines, rotavirus vaccines, or meningococcal vaccines. 
When given at the same time with other vaccines, Hexyon will be given at different injection sites. 
Hexyon contains phenylalanine, potassium and sodium 
Hexyon contains 85 micrograms phenylalanine in each 0.5-mL dose. Phenylalanine may be harmful if 
you have phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds up because the 
body cannot remove it properly. 
Hexyon contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) and less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, 
that is to say essentially “potassium-free” and “sodium-free”. 
3. 
How Hexyon is given  
Hexyon will be given to your child by a doctor or nurse trained in the use of vaccines and who are 
equipped to deal with any uncommon severe allergic reaction to the injection (see section 4 Possible 
side effects). 
Hexyon is given as an injection into a muscle (intramuscular route IM) in the upper part of your 
child’s leg or upper arm. The vaccine will never be given into a blood vessel or into or under the skin. 
The recommended dose is as follows: 
First course of vaccination (primary vaccination) 
Your child will receive either two injections given at an interval of two months, or three injections 
given at an interval of one to two months (at least four weeks apart). This vaccine should be used 
according to the local vaccination programme. 
Additional injections (booster) 
After the first course of injections, your child will receive a booster dose, in accordance with local 
recommendations, at least 6 months after the last dose of the first course. Your doctor will tell you 
when this dose should be given. 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If your child misses a dose of Hexyon 
If your child misses a scheduled injection, it is important that you discuss with your doctor or nurse 
who will decide when to give the missed dose. 
It is important to follow the instructions from the doctor or nurse so that your child completes the 
course of injections. If not, your child may not be fully protected against the diseases. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Serious allergic reactions (anaphylactic reaction) 
If any of these symptoms occur after leaving the place where your child received his/her injection, you 
must consult a doctor IMMEDIATELY: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
difficulty in breathing 
blueness of the tongue or lips 
a rash 
swelling of the face or throat  
sudden and serious malaise with drop in blood pressure causing dizziness and loss of 
consciousness, accelerated heart rate associated with respiratory disorders 
When these signs or symptoms (signs or symptoms of anaphylactic reaction) occur they usually 
develop quickly after the injection is given and while the child is still in the clinic or doctor’s surgery. 
Serious allergic reactions are a rare possibility (may affect up to 1 in 1 000 people) after receiving this 
vaccine. 
Other side effects 
If your child experiences any of the following side effects, please tell your doctor, nurse, or 
pharmacist. 
• 
Very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) are: 
- loss of appetite (anorexia) 
- crying 
- sleepiness (somnolence) 
- vomiting 
- fever (temperature 38°C or higher) 
- irritability 
- pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site 
Common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) are:

• 
• 
• 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
and get better within 3-5 days without the need for treatment.  
- fits (convulsions) with or without fever. 
Very rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people) are: 
- episodes when your child goes into a shock-like state or is pale, floppy and unresponsive for a 
period of time (hypotonic reactions or hypotonic hyporesponsive episodes HHE). 
Potential side effects 
Other side effects not listed above have been reported occasionally with other diphtheria, tetanus, 
pertussis, poliomyelitis, hepatitis B, or Hib-containing vaccines and not directly with Hexyon: 
• 
Temporary inflammation of nerves causing pain, paralysis and sensitivity disorders (Guillain-
Barré syndrome), and severe pain and decreased mobility of arm and shoulder (brachial neuritis) 
have been reported after administration of a tetanus containing vaccine. 
Inflammation of several nerves causing sensory disorders or weakness of limbs 
(polyradiculoneuritis), facial paralysis, visual disturbances, sudden dimming or loss of vision 
(optic neuritis), inflammatory disease of brain and spinal cord (central nervous system 
demyelination, multiple sclerosis) have been reported after administration of a hepatitis B 
antigen containing vaccine. 
Swelling or inflammation of the brain (encephalopathy/encephalitis). 
In babies born very prematurely (at or before 28 weeks of gestation) longer gaps than normal 
between breaths may occur for 2 - 3 days after vaccination. 
Swelling of one or both feet and lower limbs which may occur along with bluish discoloration of 
the skin (cyanosis), redness, small areas of bleeding under the skin (transient purpura), and 
severe crying following vaccination with Haemophilus influenzae type b containing vaccines. If 
this reaction occurs, it is mainly after first injections and within the first few hours following 
vaccination. All symptoms should disappear completely within 24 hours without need for 
treatment.

Contents of the pack and other information  
1.  What Hexyon is and what it is used for 
Hexyon (DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib) is a vaccine used to protect against infectious diseases. 
Hexyon helps to protect against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis and serious 
diseases caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b. Hexyon is given to children from six weeks of age. 
The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the bacteria 
and viruses that cause these different infections: 
• 
Diphtheria is an infectious disease that usually first affects the throat. In the throat, the infection 
causes pain and swelling that can lead to suffocation. The bacterium that causes the disease also 
makes a toxin (poison) that can damage the heart, kidneys, and nerves. 
Tetanus (often called lock jaw) is usually caused by the tetanus bacterium entering a deep 
wound. The bacterium makes a toxin (poison) that causes spasms of the muscles leading to 
inability to breathe and the possibility of suffocation. 
Pertussis (often called whooping cough) is a highly infectious illness that affects the airways. It 
causes severe coughing that may lead to problems with breathing. The coughing often has a 
“whooping” sound. The cough may last for one to two months or longer. Whooping cough can 
also cause ear infections, chest infections (bronchitis) that may last a long time, lung infections 
(pneumonia), fits, brain damage, and even death. 
Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus. It causes the liver to become swollen (inflamed). 
In some people, the virus can stay in the body for a long time and can eventually lead to serious 
liver problems, including liver cancer. 
Poliomyelitis (often just called polio) is caused by viruses that affect the nerves. It can lead to 
paralysis or muscle weakness most commonly of the legs. Paralysis of the muscles that control 
breathing and swallowing can be fatal. 
Haemophilus influenzae type b infections (often just called Hib) are serious bacterial infections 
and can cause meningitis (inflammation of the outer covering of the brain), which can lead to 
brain damage, deafness, epilepsy, or partial blindness. Infection can also cause inflammation 
and swelling of the throat leading to difficulties in swallowing and breathing. The infection can

• 
• 
•

affect other parts of the body such as the blood, lungs, skin, bones, and joints. 
Important information about the protection provided 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Hexyon will only help to prevent these diseases if they are caused by the bacteria or viruses 
targeted by the vaccine. Your child could get diseases with similar symptoms if they are caused 
by other bacteria or viruses. 
The vaccine does not contain any live bacteria or viruses and it cannot cause any of the 
infectious diseases against which it protects. 
This vaccine does not protect against infections caused by other types of Haemophilus 
influenzae nor against meningitis due to other micro-organisms. 
Hexyon will not protect against hepatitis infection caused by other agents such as hepatitis A, 
hepatitis C, and hepatitis E. 
Because symptoms of hepatitis B take a long time to develop, it is possible for unrecognised 
hepatitis B infection to be present at the time of vaccination. The vaccine may not prevent 
hepatitis B infection in such cases. 
As with any vaccine, Hexyon may not protect 100% of children who receive the vaccine. 
2.  What you need to know before Hexyon is given to your child 
To make sure that Hexyon is suitable for your child, it is important to talk to your doctor or nurse if 
any of the points below apply to your child. If there is anything you do not understand, ask your 
doctor, pharmacist, or nurse to explain. 
Do not use Hexyon if your child: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
has had respiratory disorder or swelling of the face (anaphylactic reaction) after administration 
of Hexyon 
has had an allergic reaction 
- to the active substances, 
- to any of the excipients listed in section 6, 
- to glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, neomycin, streptomycin or polymyxin B, as these 
substances are used during the manufacturing process 
- after previous administration of Hexyon or any other diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, 
poliomyelitis, hepatitis B, or Hib containing vaccines. 
suffered from a severe reaction affecting the brain (encephalopathy) within 7 days of a prior 
dose of a pertussis vaccine (acellular or whole cell pertussis). 
has an uncontrolled condition or severe illness affecting the brain and nervous system 
(uncontrolled neurologic disorder), or uncontrolled epilepsy. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before vaccination if your child: 
• 
has a moderate or high temperature or an acute illness (e.g. fever, sore throat, cough, cold, or 
flu). Vaccination with Hexyon may need to be delayed until your child is better. 
has had any of the following events after receiving a pertussis vaccine, as the decision to give 
further doses of pertussis containing vaccine will need to be carefully considered: 
• 
- fever of 40°C or above within 48 hours of vaccination not due to another identifiable 
cause. 
- collapse or shock-like state with hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode (drop in energy) 
within 48 hours of vaccination. 
- persistent, inconsolable crying lasting 3 hours or more, occurring within 48 hours of 
vaccination. 
- fits (convulsions) with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of vaccination. 
• 
previously had Guillain-Barré syndrome (temporary inflammation of nerves causing pain, 
48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
paralysis, and sensitivity disorders) or brachial neuritis (severe pain and decreased mobility of 
arm and shoulder) after being given a vaccine containing tetanus toxoid (an inactivated form of 
tetanus toxin). In this case, the decision to give any further vaccine containing tetanus toxoid 
should be evaluated by your doctor. 
is having a treatment that suppresses her/his immune system (the body’s natural defenses) or 
has any disease that causes the weakness of the immune system. In these cases the immune 
response to the vaccine may be decreased. It is normally recommended to wait until the end of 
the treatment or disease before vaccinating. However children with long standing problems with 
their immune system such as HIV infection (AIDS) may still be given Hexyon, but the 
protection may not be as good as in children whose immune system is healthy. 
suffers from an acute or chronic illness including chronic renal insufficiency or failure (inability 
of the kidneys to work properly). 
suffers from any undiagnosed illness of the brain or epilepsy that is not controlled. Your doctor 
will assess the potential benefit offered by vaccination. 
has any problems with the blood that cause easy bruising or bleeding for a long time after minor 
cuts. Your doctor will advise you whether your child should have Hexyon. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore, tell your doctor or nurse 
your child fainted with a previous injection. 
Other medicines or vaccines and Hexyon 
Tell your doctor or nurse if your child is taking, has recently taken, or might take any other medicines 
or vaccines. 
Hexyon can be given at the same time as other vaccines such as pneumococcal vaccines, measles, 
mumps, rubella vaccines, varicella vaccines, rotavirus vaccines, or meningococcal vaccines.  
When given at the same time with other vaccines, Hexyon will be given at different injection sites. 
Hexyon contains phenylalanine, potassium and sodium 
Hexyon contains 85 micrograms phenylalanine in each 0.5-mL dose. Phenylalanine may be harmful if 
you have phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds up because the 
body cannot remove it properly. 
Hexyon contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) and less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, 
that is to say essentially “potassium-free” and “sodium-free”. 
3. 
How Hexyon is given  
Hexyon will be given to your child by a doctor or nurse trained in the use of vaccines and who are 
equipped to deal with any uncommon severe allergic reaction to the injection (see section 4 Possible 
side effects). 
Hexyon is given as an injection into a muscle (intramuscular route IM) in the upper part of your 
child’s leg or upper arm. The vaccine will never be given into a blood vessel or into or under the skin. 
The recommended dose is as follows: 
First course of vaccination (primary vaccination) 
Your child will receive either two injections given at an interval of two months, or three injections 
given at an interval of one to two months (at least four weeks apart). This vaccine should be used 
according to the local vaccination programme. 
Additional injections (booster) 
After the first course of injections, your child will receive a booster dose, in accordance with local 
recommendations, at least 6 months after the last dose of the first course. Your doctor will tell you 
when this dose should be given. 
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If your child misses a dose of Hexyon 
If your child misses a scheduled injection, it is important that you discuss with your doctor or nurse 
who will decide when to give the missed dose. 
It is important to follow the instructions from the doctor or nurse that your child completes the course 
of injections. If not, your child may not be fully protected against the diseases. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Serious allergic reactions (anaphylactic reaction) 
If any of these symptoms occur after leaving the place where your child received his/her injection, you 
must consult a doctor IMMEDIATELY:

• 
difficulty in breathing 
blueness of the tongue or lips 
a rash 
swelling of the face or throat 
sudden and serious malaise with drop in blood pressure causing dizziness and loss of 
consciousness, accelerated heart rate associated with respiratory disorders 
When these signs or symptoms (signs or symptoms of anaphylactic reaction) occur they usually 
develop quickly after the injection is given and while the child is still in the clinic or doctor’s surgery. 
Serious allergic reactions are a rare possibility (may affect up to 1 in 1 000 people) after receiving this 
vaccine.

- episodes when your child goes into a shock-like state or is pale, floppy and unresponsive for a 
period of time (hypotonic reactions or hypotonic hyporesponsive episodes HHE). 
Potential side effects 
Other side effects not listed above have been reported occasionally with other diphtheria, tetanus, 
pertussis, poliomyelitis, hepatitis B, or Hib-containing vaccines and not directly with Hexyon: 
• 
Temporary inflammation of nerves causing pain, paralysis and sensitivity disorders (Guillain-
Barré syndrome), and severe pain and decreased mobility of arm and shoulder (brachial neuritis) 
have been reported after administration of a tetanus containing vaccine. 
Inflammation of several nerves causing sensory disorders or weakness of limbs 
(polyradiculoneuritis), facial paralysis, visual disturbances, sudden dimming or loss of vision 
(optic neuritis), inflammatory disease of brain and spinal cord (central nervous system 
demyelination, multiple sclerosis) have been reported after administration of a hepatitis B 
antigen containing vaccine. 
Swelling or inflammation of the brain (encephalopathy/encephalitis). 
In babies born very prematurely (at or before 28 weeks of gestation) longer gaps than normal 
between breaths may occur for 2 - 3 days after vaccination. 
Swelling of one or both feet and lower limbs which may occur along with bluish discoloration 
of the skin (cyanosis), redness, small areas of bleeding under the skin (transient purpura), and 
severe crying following vaccination with Haemophilus influenzae type b containing vaccines. If 
this reaction occurs, it is mainly after first injections and within the first few hours following 
vaccination. All symptoms should disappear completely within 24 hours without need for 
treatment.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Cosentyx (secukinumab, AIN457) belongs to the Pharmacotherapeutic group of Interleukin inhibitors 
(ATC Code: L04AC10).  Secukinumab is a first in class recombinant high-affinity, fully human monoclonal 
anti-human antibody of the IgG1/kappa isotype that selectively targets interleukin 17A (IL-17A). IL-17A, 
produced by a subset of T helper cells, named Th17, but also by other T cells, neutrophils and mast cells, 
promotes the expression of other pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as effector proteins. This cascade 
results in the activation of neutrophils and macrophages as well as epithelial cells and fibroblasts, and is 
considered to play an important role in the pathophysiology of many autoimmune diseases, including 
psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). This new mechanism of action offers greater specificity and 
selectivity in targeting the specific downstream cytokine. 
Cosentyx (secukinumab) was approved on 15 Jan 2015 for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.  Cosentyx is available in three different 
pharmaceutical forms: 150 mg powder for solution for injection (also referred to as Lyo in vial), 150 mg 
solution for injection in pre-filled syringe (also referred to as PFS), and 150 mg solution for injection in 
pre-filled pen (also referred to as AI or Pen). The recommended dose in psoriasis is 300 mg of 
secukinumab by subcutaneous injection with initial dosing at Weeks 0, 1, 2 and 3, followed by monthly 
maintenance dosing starting at Week 4. Each 300 mg dose is given as two subcutaneous injections of 150 
mg. 
The current type II variation application was to register a new indication of psoriatic arthritis (PsA). PsA is 
a chronic debilitating disease which afflicts peripheral synovial, axial, and entheseal structures and is 
associated with nail involvement and skin psoriasis in up to 30 % of patients. Current therapies include 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and 
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) inhibitors. Although TNFα inhibitor therapy has dramatically improved 
the treatment, 30% to 40% of patients fail to respond to these therapies. There are new agents with 
alternate mechanisms of action such as ustekinumab and apremilast but there still remains an unmet 
need for agents with novel mechanism of action. 
The PsA clinical development program for secukinumab included patients with active PsA disease despite 
current or previous NSAIDs, DMARDs, and/or TNFα inhibitor therapy. The proposed new indication was: 
Cosentyx, alone or in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for the treatment of active 
psoriatic arthritis in adult patients when the response to previous disease- modifying anti- rheumatic drug 
(DMARD) therapy has been inadequate. 
The proposed posology was: 
For patients with concomitant moderate to severe plaque psoriasis or who are anti TNFα inadequate 
responders (TNFa-IR), the recommended dose is 300 mg by subcutaneous injection with initial dosing at 
Weeks 0, 1, 2 and 3, followed by monthly maintenance dosing starting at Week 4. Each 300 mg dose is 
given as two subcutaneous injections of 150 mg. 
For other patients, the recommended dose is 150 mg by subcutaneous injection with initial dosing at 
Weeks 0, 1, 2 and 3, followed by monthly maintenance dosing starting at Week 4. 
The PsA clinical development program included two phase II studies (A2206 in PsA patients and F2201 in 
a related arthritic condition RA) and two pivotal phase III studies in the target indication and population 
(F2306 and F2312).

The development of new products for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis is covered in the Guideline on 
clinical investigation of medicinal products indicated for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis 
(CHMP/EWP/438/04). Recommendations of this guideline were mostly taken into account. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Neutralization of human IL-17A-, IL-17AF-dependent production of MMP-3 by human synovial fibroblasts 
The  in  vitro  neutralising  activity  of  secukinumab  for  IL-17-induced  metalloproteinase  production  was 
evaluated  by  studying  the  inhibition  of  human  MMP-3  release  from  primary  human  fibroblast-like 
synoviocytes  (FLS)  stimulated  with  either  human  IL-17A  or  IL-17AF  in  combination  with  a  fixed 
concentration of 60 pM of human TNFα. 
FLS  were  costimulated  with  30  pM  IL17A  and  60  pM  TNFa.  Secukinumab  neutralised  the  induction  of 
MMP-3  secretion  potently  and  in  a  dose-dependent  manner  with  an  IC50  value  of  0.067  ±  0.004  nM 
(mean ± SEM, n=3; Figure 1). The heterodimer IL-17AF, which is less potent than IL-17A, was used at a 
33-fold higher concentration (1 nM IL-17AF vs 30 pM IL-17A) to achieve comparable MMP-3 levels. Under 
these  conditions,  secukinumab  neutralized  IL-17AF-dependent  effects  in  the  nanomolar  range  with  an 
IC 50 value of 4.471 ± 0.595 nM (mean ± SEM, n=3; Figure 2). 
Figure 1. Inhibitory effect of secukinumab (AIN457) on MMP-3 secretion by human 
FLS costimulated with IL-17A/ TNFa 
Primary  human  FLS  were  co-stimulated  overnight  with  IL-17A  (30pM)/  TNFa  (60pM)  in  the  presence  of  increasing 
concentration of secukinumab (AIN457) or control IgG1. MMP-3 release was measured by AlphaLISA. 
Overall,  the  inhibition  of  MMP-3  release  by  secukinumab  is  in  the  similar  range  as  the  previously 
described inhibition of IL-6 release from FLS by the antibody, where an IC50 value of 0.14 ± 0.02 nM was 
determined for IL-17A (30 pM)/ TNFα co-stimulation, and an IC50 value of 3.30 ± 0.20 nM for IL-17AF (1 
nM)/  TNFα-induced  effects  (RD-2013-00026).  Therefore,  sub-nanomolar  or  nanomolar  concentrations  of 
secukinumab were sufficient to neutralize human IL-17A- and IL-17AF-dependent release, respectively, of 
pro-inflammatory and tissue-degrading mediators from human primary FLS. Since MMP-3 plays a role in 
Assessment report

tissue  degradation  (Burrage  et  al,  2006),  these data  suggest  that  neutralization  of  the  bioactivity  of  IL-
17A  and/or  IL-17AF  may  contribute  to  the  inhibition  of  the  structural  damage  in  inflammatory  and 
autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. 
Figure 2. Inhibitory effect of secukinumab (AIN457) on MMP-3 secretion by human 
FLS costimulated with IL-17AF/ TNFa 
Primary  human  FLS  were  co-stimulated  overnight  with  IL-17AF  (1nM)/  TNFa  (60pM)  in  the  presence  of  increasing 
concentration of secukinumab (AIN457) or control IgG1. MMP-3 release was measured by AlphaLISA. 
2.2.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
A comparison of PK parameters in cynomolgus monkeys and humans after intravenous administration is 
presented in Table 1. The similar PK characteristics observed in the cynomolgus monkey and PsA and AS 
patients are in line with the comparable binding activities of secukinumab to cynomolgus monkey and 
human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). 
Human exposure multiples 
Using a population PK model based on pharmacokinetic data from several i.v. and s.c. studies in PsA and 
AS patients, mean concentration-time profiles resulting from the dose regimens in the phase III program 
were simulated. This allowed the calculation of human exposure multiples for the 300 or 150 mg s.c. 
dosing regimens in PsA patients with loading doses at Weeks 0, 1, 2, and 3, followed by maintenance 
doses every four weeks (q4w) starting at Week 4 until week 48. 
For the calculation of human exposure multiples, use was made of i) the experimental maximum 
concentration at steady-state, Cmax,ss, (5455 μg/mL) and ii) the experimental AUCtau at steady-state 
divided by the dosing interval tau to obtain the average steady-state concentration Cav,ss (4824 μg/mL) 
for the 13 week toxicology study in cynomolgus monkey with single weekly s.c. administration at the 
NOAEL of 150 mg/kg. Exposure data and exposure multiples for the loading and maintenance phases are 
given in Table 2.

studies in patients. 
d)  Predicted  Cav,ss  and  Cmax,ss  in  patients  were  compared  with  Cav,ss  and  Cmax,ss,  respectively,  at 
the NOAEL of 150 mg/kg s.c. in 13 weeks study in cynomolgus monkey in order to calculate the exposure 
multiple during maintenance; tau (dosing interval) is 7 days in the cynomolgus tox study and 28 days in 
patients in the maintenance phase. 
e) Derived PK characteristics for mean simulated human exposure profiles

The average serum concentrations at steady-state observed in monkeys after 13 weekly s.c. doses were 
192-  and  96-fold  higher  than  the  predicted  average  serum  concentrations  expected  in  PsA  patients 
treated  with  monthly  maintenance  s.c.  doses  of  150  mg  and  300  mg  respectively.  At  the  end  of  the 
loading  phase,  human  exposure  is  approximately  2-fold  higher  than  during  the  maintenance  phase. 
Therefore,  exposure  multiples  are  approximately  half  of  those  described  above  during  the  maintenance 
phase. 
For  assessment  of  non-target  related  toxicity  the  species  difference  in  binding  affinity  to  the  IL-17A 
receptor is not important, therefore human exposure multiple calculations on the basis of the exposure in 
man and animals were considered valid. 
2.2.3.  Toxicology 
No new toxicity data were submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.2.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Secukinumab is a high-affinity fully human monoclonal anti-human Interleukin-17A antibody and in 
accordance with the CHMP guideline on the environmental risk assessment (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) 
is exempted from testing because of its chemical structure. 
2.2.1.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
One new pharmacodynamics study addressing the neutralising effect of secukinumab on IL-17A and IL-
17AF-dependent production of MMP-3 by human synovial fibroblasts was included. The new data support 
the role of secukinumab in prevention of cartilage damage in PsA, AS and RA patients. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  comparison  of  PK  characteristics  and  systemic  exposure  to  humans 
demonstrate  significant  exposure  margin  to  PsA  and  AS  patients  and  that  the  nonclinical  safety  data 
generated  to  support  the  initial  marketing  authorisation  of  Cosentyx  for  treatment  of  psoriasis  patients 
were adequate and sufficient to support the indication in PsA 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Secukinumab displays PK properties typical of a human IgG1-type immunoglobulin interacting with a 
soluble target, i.e. a low clearance and a low total volume of distribution. The PK properties of 
secukinumab in patients with PsA were described using population PK analysis. The studies included in 
the analysis are described in Table 3.  
Table 3.  Studies included in the PPK analysis.

Page 12/84 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Based on the final model and parameter estimates (Table 4), PK profiles were simulated and secondary 
exposure metrics such as AUC, Cavg, Cmin, Cmax, Tmax, and t1/2 were derived. 
Table 4. Parameters of the final PK model   
Assessment report

Page 13/84 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
A two-compartment model, with first-order absorption (for sc drug administration) and zero-order 
infusion (for iv drug administration) adequately described secukinumab PK profiles.  
Absorption 
On the basis of the PPK model the mean maximum concentrations (Cmax) at steady-state following sc 
loading + 150 mg sc and 300 mg sc maintenance dose were estimated to be 31 µg/ml and 62.1 µg/ml 
and occurred at approximately 6 days after dose in PsA patients. The Cmax at steady-state is 
approximately 2 times higher than the Cmax after the single-dose. 
Bioavailability 
On the basis of the PPK model, the bioavailability after sc administration is 85% in PsA patients. 
Distribution 
Estimation from the PPK model indicated a low total volume of distribution (central compartment volume 
of 3.66 l (CV% 30.5) and peripheral compartment volume of 2.45 l (CV% 30.6) in a typical PsA patient 
weighing 84 kg. 
Elimination 
Secukinumab has a terminal half-life (t1/2) averaging 25 days with an inter-patient variability of 27.5% 
and secukinumab has slow serum clearance (CL = 0.19 l/day, CV% 32.5%) on the basis of the PPK 
model. 
Clearance and volumes of secukinumab vary with body weight in an allometric relationship. For CL and 
central volume of distribution the allometric exponents were estimated to be 0.8 and 0.4 respectively. 
CRP at baseline, race (non-Asian vs Asian), and anti-TNFα response status did not have a clinically 
relevant influence on CL (after adjusting for bodyweight). 
Excretion 
No specific elimination studies have been performed and this is acceptable because secukinumab is not 
expected to be excreted in urine or secreted into the bile. 
Metabolism 
The majority of IgG elimination occurs via intracellular catabolism, following fluid-phase or receptor 
mediated endocytosis. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
On the basis of the PPK model the PK of secukinumab is linear with no evidence of a time dependent 
change in the CL. There is also no evidence of a dose-dependence of CL. On the basis of the study 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/665427/2015 
Page 14/84 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
CAIN457F2312 there was an evidence of dose-proportionality in exposure (mean concentrations at 
steady-state) across the 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg during the sc administration. 
Dose-independency of secukinumab CL was demonstrated by plotting the individual estimates of CL from 
the PPK model against the treatment regimens (Figure 3). 
Figure 3. Relative CL by treatment group (after adjusting for bodyweight) 
Relative CL indicates relative to the CL of 0.19 l/day in a “typical subject” (e.g., a value of 0.1 indicates a 
10% relative increase in CL). 
The estimated CL in the clinical phase III studies CAIN457F2306 and CAIN457F2312 was generally 
consistent across the active study groups. In the study CAIN457A2206 the CLs were lower (exposures 
were higher) compared to the other phase III studies, but this was considered to be a chance finding. 
 Exposure in target population 
No clinically relevant differences in secukinumab PK were observed between the various autoimmune 
diseases studied (AS, PsA, PsO, RA, CD, AS, non-infectious uveitis). PK is also similar when compared 
between healthy volunteers, PsA and AS patients. Furthermore, PK similarity was observed between the 
lyophilisate formulation (LYO) and solution and between the three forms LYO, prefilled syringe (PFS) and 
auto-injector/pen (AI). The exposure profiles of a typical patient given the proposed dosing are illustrated 
in Figure 4.

Special populations 
No clinical studies were performed in patients with impaired hepatic or renal function and that was 
considered acceptable because no great effect on exposure is anticipated on the assumption that 
secukinumab has typical IgG pharmacokinetic properties. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No in vitro or in vivo drug-drug interaction studies were performed. 
The PPK results in PsA patients with secukinumab indicated that MTX had no impact on the disposition of 
secukinumab. However, as no data of concomitant use of MTX (and glucocorticoids) in PsA patients (or in 
AS patients) were available in the initial submission the MAH was requested to justify that MTX and 
glucocorticoids have no impact on the disposition of secukinumab. The MAH provided further analyses 
from the phase III studies for patients with and without concomitant methotrexate or glucocorticoid use 
which showed that there were no systematic trends, either downward or upward, in concentrations of one 
subgroup versus the other. Therefore, the following sentence was proposed to be added to the Cosentyx 
SmPC: “No interaction was seen when Cosentyx was administered concomitantly with MTX and/or 
corticosteroids in arthritis studies (including in patients with PsA and AS)”, which was accepted by the 
CHMP. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The pharmacodynamic effect of secukinumab in binding to IL-17A, and inhibiting IL-17A signalling, is 
linked with the reduction of the inflammatory processes of PsA. Based on the data provided within the 
initial MAA, the engagement of IL-17A was seen as an increase in serum total IL-17A levels after 
secukinumab treatment, followed by a slow release of the IL-17A-secukinumab complex. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
A meta-analysis entitled Total Interleukin 17A analysis report (Release date: 06-Feb-2015 was provided 
in order to assess the total IL-17A levels from eight phase I, IIb and phase III clinical trials which were 
either not part of the clinical study reports or only partly summarized in the CSR (Studies A1101, A2206, 
A2209, A2212, A2220, A2309, F2201 and F2208). 
Pharmacodynamic blood samples for quantification of total IL-17A (i.e., the sum of free and secukinumab 
bound IL-17 in serum) were taken at the same time points as for pharmacokinetic. The MESO Scale 
Discovery electrochemiluminescence assay was used. 
Study A2206 i.e., the Proof-of-Concept study in PsA was included in the meta-analysis. The median total 
IL-17A concentration-time profile after a dose of 10 mg/kg iv on Days 0 and 22 is shown in Figure 5. 
The highest median concentration was 107 pg/mL, observed 2 weeks after the first dose, followed by 
slowly declining concentrations from 90 to 50 pg/mL during a half year time. 
Figure 5. Median total IL-17A serum concentration-time profiles (A2206) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/665427/2015 
Page 16/84 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Based on the meta-analysis, the increase in total IL-17A concentrations at post dose time points is due to 
binding to secukinumab to form an IL-17A-secukinumab complex which has slower clearance than that of 
uncomplexed IL-17A. The decrease after treatment reflects the decrease in secukinumab concentrations. 
In  summary,  total  IL-17A  profiles  across  studies  in  both  healthy  subjects  and  patient  populations 
(psoriasis,  psoriatic  arthritis,  ankylosing  spondylitis,  rheumatoid  arthritis)  show  concentration-time 
patterns that are consistent with target engagement of secukinumab. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
The MAH provided a population PK (PPK) modelling report with the pooled PPK analysis of Cosentyx in 
PsA.  The data were collected l from the following studies: CAIN457A2206, CAIN457F2306 and 
CAIN457F2312. Graphical exploratory analysis of Cosentyx exposure –response of efficacy, adverse 
events (AEs) and radiographic assessments in PsA patients were also provided.  The focus was on 
describing exposure-response trend at a fixed time point, rather than through longitudinal PK/PD 
modelling. 
The 2-compartment PK model adequately described the observed concentration-time profiles for sc and iv 
secukinumab in PsA patients.  The influence of covariates on the individual PK was explored. The 
following covariates were investigated: bodyweight, age, gender, race (non-Asian vs. Asian), disease 
activity assessed by the PASI score, DAS28 score and CRP level at baseline, previous use of biologics, 
response status to anti-TNFα therapy, concomitant use of methotrexate, and time since first diagnosis of 
psoriatic arthritis. They were tested using a full covariate modelling approach. Only the effect of 
bodyweight was considered clinically relevant based on an assumption that only changes in typical 
parameter estimates >20% are clinically important. Dose dependency or time dependency was not seen. 
The PK properties were as expected for an IgG antibody and the PPK model parameters were similar to a 
previous PPK analysis of secukinumab in psoriasis patients. 
In the graphical analysis, a comparison of Cmin concentrations between patients < 90 kg and ≥ 90 kg 
showed that the heavier patient the lower exposure. This is in line with findings from the PPK analysis and 
the known impact of body weight on the PK of mAbs. Also in the clinical studies with psoriasis patients, 
the body weight of the patients was demonstrated to have an effect on the exposure.  The results of this 
exploratory analysis were limited to the sc loading regimen tested in study CAIN457F2312 (loading dose 
on weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, followed by Q4W dosing).  
Clear exposure-response relationships were observed in all efficacy parameters (ACR, PASI, DAS and 
HAQ-DI), with a trend for increased response with higher Cmin concentrations. The exposure-response 
relationship of endpoints reflecting the arthritic components of the disease (ACR20/50/70, DAS28-CRP) 
appeared to plateau at Cmin level higher than ca. 20 µg/ml. This concentration (20 µg/ml) generally 
corresponds to the typical steady-state Cmin achieved following a 150 mg sc Q4W dosing. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/665427/2015 
Page 17/84 
 
  
  
 
 
Exposure-response relationships of PASI75/90 and HAQ-DI demonstrated a trend for a monotonous 
increase in response over the concentration range.  
No evidence of an effect of Cmin was observed on AE rates for the following categories: any AE, 
infections and infestations, upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis, and urinary tract infection. 
There was an increasing trend with exposure for SAEs and oral herpes. However, its interpretation was 
complicated by the fact that it appeared to be driven by lower AE rates in the first two exposure 
categories ([0, 10] and [10, 20] µg/mL) and higher AE rate in the last exposure category (>30 µg/mL) 
when compared to the placebo group (0 µg/mL). Also, the slope coefficients were not statistically 
significant at the 0.1 level for those AE categories. It was therefore difficult to conclude for a Cmin-related 
effect in both cases. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK data of secukinumab in PsA patients were provided from 3 clinical studies. In addition, simulated 
PK data from the PPK model and a graphical exploratory analysis of exposure-response of efficacy, AEs 
and radiographic assessments were presented. 
In the clinical study CAIN457A2206, the studied secukinumab dose was 10 mg/kg as an iv infusion 
administered twice by 3 weeks interval (also placebo group). For evaluation of the PK of secukinumab, 
the chosen dosing regimen was not optimal because the 2nd dose was administered, while there were 
still substantial amounts of drug from the 1st dose. The reported PK parameters for secukinumab were 
quite similar as earlier seen in the study with similar dosing regimen and route with psoriasis patients.  
In the extension study (CAIN457A2206E1), the studied secukinumab dose was 3 mg/kg administered as 
an iv infusion monthly up to 6 months (with a possible extension of a further 6 months).The steady-state 
was reached on the basis of the pre-dose and post-dose infusion serum concentrations after week 16. 
The Cmax,ss and Cmin,ss values of secukinumab were lower in the samples from patients, which 
received placebo in the study CAIN457A2206. 
In the clinical study CAIN457F2306, the studied loading dose of secukinumab was 10 mg/kg iv at 
baseline, weeks 2 and 4, and thereafter the studied secukinumab doses were 75 mg and 150 mg s.c 
monthly (starting at week 8). At week 4, serum concentrations reflected the rise in exposure (the mean 
concentrations were about equal both after 75 mg and 150 mg sc). At week 16, mean concentrations 
declined due to the less-frequent sc dosing as the iv dosing. The mean secukinumab concentrations 
declined still at weeks 24 and 52. The mean secukinumab concentrations with 75 mg sc dose were 16.2 
µg/ml and 10.2 µg/ml at weeks 24 and 52 and with 150 mg sc dose 24.4 µg/ml and 18.6 µg/ml, 
respectively. In this study, there were also patients who received placebo as the loading dose and at 
week 16 were classified as responder or non-responders. The non-responders received secukinumab 75 
mg or 150 mg sc monthly and the responders remained on placebo until week 24 and thereafter received 
either secukinumab 75 mg or 150 mg sc. The mean secukinumab concentrations were at week 52 very 
close to those seen in the active secukinumab groups. 
In the pivotal clinical study CAIN457F2312 the studied secukinumab doses were 75 mg or 150 mg or 300 
mg sc weekly up to 4 week and thereafter monthly starting at week 4. In this study, there were also 
patients receiving placebo in the same study design as in the study CAIN457F2306, except the doses 
after the re-randomisation were 150 mg or 300 mg sc The dose-proportionality in the secukinumab 
concentrations was found at week 4 and also at steady-state (weeks 16 and 24). The mean secukinumab 
concentrations were in the expected range i.e., with 75 mg sc ~10 µg/ml , with 150 mg sc ~ 20 µg/ml 
and with 300 mg ~ 40 µg/ml. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/665427/2015 
Page 18/84 
 
  
  
 
The inter-subject variation in the PK parameters of secukinumab after iv administration was low or 
moderate (16-33%). Based on the PPK model in PsA, the derived inter-subject variability for PK 
parameters such as Cmin,ss, Cmax,ss, Cavg,ss, AUCtau,ss for the 150 mg and 300 mg sc regimens was 
in the range of 31.4% and 45.0%. Estimates of intra-subject variability were not available from PsA 
patients. In the Cmin values the inter-subject variation was usually moderate (> 30%). 
On the basis of the PPK model, the PK of secukinumab is linear with no evidence of a time dependent 
change in the CL or dose-dependence of CL (CL = 0.19 l/day, CV% 32.5%). 
On the basis of the PPK model, the bioavailability after sc administration was 85% in PsA patients being 
better than in psoriasis patients (66-77%).  
The body weight of the patients was found to have an impact on secukinumab serum concentrations and 
also on efficacy. On the basis of the PPK model and graphical analysis the heavier the patient, the lower 
the Cmin concentrations were observed. There was also a trend that the higher the Cmin concentrations, 
the better response in efficacy. The Cmin,ss of secukinumab needed for the therapeutic effect was 
estimated to be about 20 µg/ml. This steady-state concentration is achieved for most patients with the 
proposed dosing regimen with 150 mg or 300 mg sc. The 75 mg sc was demonstrated to be not 
sufficiently effective. The applicant provided adequate secukinumab concentration data separately for 
patients < 90 kg and ≥90 kg and discussion about the secukinumab concentrations and efficacy variables 
(i.e., ACR, PASI, DAS and HAQ-DI) in the pivotal clinical study CAIN457F2312. On the basis of the 
simulations etc. no consistent clinically meaningful benefit could be observed for the 300 mg dose over 
150 mg in heavier patients. 
Regarding the covariate effect in anti TNFa-IR patients, this appears to affect Emax rather than EC50 
suggesting that these patients are likely to have a lower treatment effect even at the higher exposures.  
In contrast, the lower effect observed in patients in the upper weight category (>90kg) appears to be 
attributed to a lower exposure as both EC50 and Emax are similar across weight groups.). 
Age and gender do not appear to be significant predictors of secukinumab PK, why the tendency for age 
and gender related differences in response appear to be related to PD for these sub-groups. 
In all clinical studies with PsA patients, there were pre-dose samples with quantifiable concentrations of 
secukinumab. The number of these samples; however, was relatively small and did not impact on 
interpretation of PK results. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of secukinumab in PsA patients was very similar as in the psoriatic patients. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
Study A2206 
A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled multi-center proof-of-concept study to assess the efficacy 
of AIN457 in patients with psoriatic arthritis. 
Study A2206 was a proof of concept study in patients with diagnosis of active psoriatic arthritis based on 
Classification Criteria or Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR). The patients received secukinumab 10 mg/kg iv or 
matching placebo on Days 1 and 22. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/665427/2015 
Page 19/84 
 
  
  
 
ACR20 response rates on secukinumab and placebo at Week 6 did not differ significantly and the primary 
endpoint of the study was therefore not met.  However, preliminary evidence for therapeutic benefit of 
secukinumab in PsA patients was observed as numerically greater responses on secukinumab were seen. 
Study A2206E1 
An open label non-randomized extension study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AIN457 (anti 
interleukin-17 monoclonal antibody) in patients with psoriatic arthritis. 
Study A2206E1 was an open-label extension of the phase II proof of concept study A2206, with iv dosing 
3 mg/kg q4w. The primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability of secukinumab. Patients 
previously treated with placebo in the core study achieved response rates similar to those initially treated 
with secukinumab, and the efficacy was maintained during the 52-week treatment period. 
Study F2201 
A 16-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, dose-finding study 
to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of subcutaneous secukinumab (AIN457) followed by an 
extension phase up to a total of 60 weeks in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite stable 
treatment with methotrexate. 
F2201 was a study in patients with active RA, with treatment up to Week 48 and a 12-week follow-up 
period.  Secukinumab was administered sc q4w with a dose range of 25 mg, 75 mg, 150 mg or 300 mg. 
No loading dose was given. 
Although the primary efficacy endpoint (ACR20 response of secukinumab compared to placebo at Week 
16) was not achieved, there was a clear numerical trend in favour of secukinumab 75-300 mg within the 
primary and the secondary efficacy variables. 
Taken together, the initial doses and the dosing regimen in phase II studies were based on preclinical in 
vivo efficacy data in animal models from the initial MAA. The two phase II studies A2206 and F2201 
provided preliminary evidence of efficacy in two arthritic disease models, PsA and RA. The posology 
carried forward to the phase III studies was mainly based on pK/PD modelling and simulation of different 
treatment regimens as well as data in psoriasis. 
2.4.2.  Main studies

12. 
Figure 6.Schematic of Study F2306 
At Week 16, all patients were to be classified as responders (≥20% improvement from baseline in both 
tender and swollen joint counts) or non-responders. Patients who were randomized to placebo at baseline 
were to be re-randomized by the IRT to receive double blind treatment up to two years, as follows: 
•  Patients on placebo (Group 3) who were responders remained on placebo until week 24. At Week 
24,  these  patients  received  either  secukinumab  75  or  150  mg  every  4  weeks,  regardless  of 
responder status (as dictated by the re-randomization). 
•  Patients on placebo (Group 3) who were non-responders were to be re-randomized (1:1) at Week 
16 to receive either secukinumab 75 mg or 150 mg sc every 4 weeks. 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  was  to  demonstrate  that  the  efficacy  of  secukinumab  75  or  150  mg  at  Week  24 
was superior to placebo in patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) based on the proportion of patients 
achieving an American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR20) response. 
The secondary objectives were to demonstrate that: 
1.  The  efficacy  of  secukinumab  75  or  150  mg  at  Week  24  was  superior  to  placebo  based  on  the 
proportion of patients achieving a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 75 (PASI75) response in the 
subgroup of patients who have ≥3% skin involvement with psoriasis. 
2.  The  efficacy  of  secukinumab  75  or  150  mg  at  Week  24  was  superior  to  placebo  based  on  the 
proportion  of  patients  achieving  a  PASI90  response  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  who  have  ≥3% 
skin involvement with psoriasis.

3.  The improvement (change) from baseline on secukinumab 75 or 150 mg was superior to placebo 
for the Disease Activity Score 28-CRP (DAS28-CRP) at Week 24. 
4.  The improvement (change) from baseline on secukinumab 75 or 150 mg was superior to placebo 
for the Short Form 36 (SF36)- Physical Component Summary (PCS) at Week 24. 
5.  The improvement (change) from baseline on secukinumab 75 or 150 mg was superior to placebo 
for the Health Assessment Questionnaire – Disability Index (HAQ-DI©) at Week 24. 
6.  The  efficacy  of  secukinumab  75  or  150  mg  at  Week  24  was  superior  to  placebo  based  on  the 
proportion of patients achieving an ACR50 response. 
7.  The  improvement  (change)  from  baseline  to  Week  24  on  secukinumab  pooled  regimen  (75  mg 
and  150  mg  s.c.)  was  superior  to  placebo  for  joint/bone  structural  damage  (van  der  Heijde 
modified total Sharp score [vdH-mTSS]). 
8.  The efficacy of secukinumab pooled regimen (75 mg and 150 mg s.c.) at Week 24 was superior to 
placebo  based  on  the  proportion  of  patients  with  dactylitis  in  the  subset  of  patients  who  have 
dactylitis at baseline. 
9.  The efficacy of secukinumab pooled regimen (75 mg and 150 mg s.c.) at Week 24 was superior to 
placebo  based  on  the  proportion  of  patients  with  enthesitis  in  the  subset  of  patients  who  have 
enthesitis at baseline. 
10. The improvement (change) from baseline to Week 24 on secukinumab 75 or 150 mg was superior 
to placebo for joint/bone structural damage (vdH-mTSS). 
11. The overall safety and tolerability of each secukinumab regimen compared to placebo a assessed 
by  vital  signs,  clinical  laboratory  values,  electrocardiogram  (ECG)  and  adverse  events  (AEs) 
monitoring. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was ACR20 response at Week 24. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were: 
•  PASI75  response  at  Week  24  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  who  had  ≥3%  skin  involvement  with 
psoriasis at baseline. 
•  PASI90  response  at  Week  24  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  who  had  ≥3%  skin  involvement  with 
psoriasis at baseline. 
•  Disease activity score DAS28-CRP at Week 24. 
•  SF36-PCS at Week 24. 
•  Health Assessment Questionnaire – Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 24. 
•  ACR50 response at Week 24. 
• 
Joint/bone structural damage (van der Heijde-modified total Sharp score [vdH-mTSS]). 
•  Proportion of patients with dactylitis at Week 24 in the subset of patients who have dactylitis at 
baseline. 
•  Proportion of patients with enthesitis at Week 24 in the subset of patients who have enthesitis at 
baseline.

Sample size 
A 5% two-sided type I error rate was used to control for type I error. Two secukinumab doses were 
tested vs. placebo with respect to the primary endpoint (ACR20 response at Week 24), thus the type-I-
error was split to 2.5% two-sided for each comparison. Sample sizes were based on this type I error 
assumption. 
For  the  primary  endpoint,  ACR20  in  the  overall  population,  200  patients  per  group  would  yield 
approximately  99%  power  to  detect  a  treatment  difference  in  the  response  rates  between  the 
secukinumab regimens and placebo with the above assumptions (Fisher’s exact test, NQuery 7.0). 
A  total  of  817  patients  were  screened  and  606  patients  were  randomised  to  the  treatment  groups;  202 
patients in each treatment group. 
Randomisation 
At baseline (Visit 2), all eligible patients were randomized via the IRT (Interactive Response Technology) 
to one of the treatment arms (1:1:1 ratio) At Week 16 (Visit 8), all patients were classified as responders 
or non-responders. Patients who were randomized to placebo at baseline were re-randomized to receive 
double blind treatment up to 2 years. 
Randomization  was  stratified  according  to  being  either  TNFα  inadequate  responders  (TNFa-IR)  or  TNFα 
inhibitor  naïve  patients.  30%  of  patients  were  to  be  TNFa-IR  to  ensure  a  representative  patient 
population for the assessment of efficacy and safety. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study. 
Statistical methods 
Summary statistics for continuous variables included N, mean, standard deviation minimum, lower 
quartile, median, upper quartile, and maximum. For binary or discrete variables the absolute number of 
patients in each category and relative frequencies were provided. If not otherwise specified, p-values and 
confidence intervals were two-sided and the level of significance was set to 5% (two-sided, family-wise 
type- I-error). 
Statistical  analyses  of  efficacy  variables  were  performed  on  an  intent-to-treat  basis,  involving  all 
randomized  patients  who  were  assigned  to  study  treatment  (Full  analysis  set,  FAS).  A  sequentially 
rejective  testing  strategy  was  used  to  evaluate  the  study  hypotheses  for  the  primary  and  secondary 
variables (hypotheses H1 to H19) while retaining a family-wise type I error of 5%.  
For  binary  variables  (e.g.,  ACR20  response)  a  logistic  regression  model  was  fitted  with  treatment  and 
TNF-alpha inhibitor status as factors and baseline score (if appropriate) and weight as covariates. Missing 
responses were considered as non-responders. Continuous variables were evaluated using a mixed-effect 
model repeated measures (MMRM) which was valid under the missing at random (MAR) assumption. 
The MAR assumption for missing data in MMRM analyses for continuous endpoints is questionable. It was 
defined that the data collected after the placebo patient switched to secukinumab at Week 16 was treated 
as missing. Thus the occurrence of these missing values at Week 24 is due to the study design and is not 
at  random.  The  MAH  conducted  additional  sensitivity  analyses  as  requested  and  confirmed  that  the 
conclusions of the clinical study report remain valid.

Results 
Participant flow 
A  total  of  817  patients  were  screened  and  606  were  randomized  to  the  3  treatment  groups.  Of  the 
randomized patients, 515 (85.0%) patients completed 52 weeks of treatment (86.1% in the secukinumab 
10 mg/kg-75 mg group, 89.1% in the secukinumab  10 mg/kg-150 mg group and 79.7% in the placebo 
group (Table 5).  
Of  the  202  patients  in  the  placebo  group,  187  patients  were  re-randomized  (1:1).  Of  these  placebo 
patients,  4  patients  discontinued  before  receiving  secukinumab,  123  non-responding  patients  received 
secukinumab starting at Week 16 (75 mg: 62 patients and 150 mg: 61 patients) sc every 4 weeks, and 
60  patients  continued  on  placebo  until  Week  24  and  then  received  either  secukinumab  75  mg  (28 
patients) or 150 mg (32 patients) sc every 4 weeks. Overall, 161 patients in the placebo group completed 
Week 52. 
For  the  91  patients  who  discontinued  at  Week  52,  the  most  common  reason  for  premature 
discontinuation  was  lack  of  efficacy  which  occurred  at  a  higher  rate  in  the  placebo  group  (6.4%) 
compared  to  the  secukinumab  10  mg/kg-75  mg  group  (3.0%)  and  the  secukinumab  10  mg/kg-150  mg 
group (3.5%). 
Similar percentages of patients reported having at least one protocol deviation up to Week 24 (28.7% vs. 
23.8%  vs.  29.7%  in  the  secukinumab  10  mg/kg-75  mg,  secukinumab  10  mg/kg-150  mg  and  placebo 
groups, respectively). The most common categories were “key procedures not performed as per-protocol” 
and “GCP-related deviation”. Percentages of patients reporting at least one protocol deviation during the 
entire treatment period were 34.7% in secukinumab 10 mg/kg-75 mg, 31.2% in secukinumab 10 mg/kg-
150 mg and 34.2% in placebo.

Study completion date: Not applicable. Last Visit 17 / Week 52 for interim analysis was on 09 Oct 2013. 
Conduct of the study 
The  study  protocol  was  amended  3  times.  The  amendments  are  considered minor  and  occurred prior to 
study un-blinding. 
The following changes were made to the planned analysis: 
• 
Prior to database lock, the baseline definition was revised in the statistical analysis plan to allow 
X-ray and MRI values collected within 30 days/7 days (respectively) after dosing to be considered 
as baseline values. 
Baseline data 
The majority of patients were < 65 years of age (89.1% in both the secukinumab 10 mg/kg-75 mg group 
and  secukinumab  10  mg/kg-150  mg  group  and  95.0%  in  the  placebo  group)  with  a  mean  age  of  49 
years). More than half of the patients were female (54.5%) and more than two-thirds of patients (74.6%) 
were  non-  hispanic  or  latino.  Around  20%  were  smokers  at  baseline.  The  mean  BMI  (±SD)  was: 
30.05±6.250  kg/m2,  in  the  secukinumab  10  mg/kg-75  mg  group,  29.86±6.828  kg/m2  in  the 
secukinumab 10 mg/kg-150 mg group and 28.67±6.476 kg/m2 in the placebo group.

Numbers analysed 
The following analysis sets were used for the data analysis: Randomized set; Full analysis set (FAS); and 
Safety  set.  The  total  number  of  patients  in  each  analysis  set  was  606  and  the  number  of  patients  by 
treatment group was 202. Efficacy analyses were performed on an intent-to-treat basis, involving all 606 
randomized patients who were assigned to study treatment (Table 7). 
Table 7. Analysis sets by treatment sequence (Randomised set, Study F2306) 
Outcomes and estimation 
The results of the primary efficacy variable ACR20 response using non-responder imputation for the FAS 
at Week 24 is shown in Table 8 and Figure 7.  
Secukinumab  at  both  doses  (10  mg/kg-75  mg  and  10  mg/kg-150  mg)  was  statistically  significantly 
superior to  placebo  for  ACR20  response  at  Week 24  (p<0.0001).  At  Week  24,  the  ACR20  response  rate 
was 50.5% for secukinumab 10 mg/kg-75 mg, 50.0% for secukinumab 10 mg/kg-150 mg and 17.3% for 
placebo.

Secondary efficacy results 
The  results  of  the  hypothesis  tests  within  the  testing  strategy  are  shown  in  Table  9.  Secukinumab  10 
mg/kg-75 mg and 10 mg/kg-150 mg were superior to placebo at Week 24 for all endpoints in the testing 
hierarchy. All p-values except that for the vdH-mTSS were <0.0001.

in prefilled syringes to demonstrate the efficacy at 24 weeks and to assess the long term efficacy, safety 
and tolerability up to 5 years in patients with Active Psoriatic Arthritis 
Methods 
Study participants 
There were 76 study centres in 10 countries (Australia 4 centres, Belgium 3 centres, Canada 6  centres, 
Czech Republic 4 centres, Germany 9 centres, Poland 6 centres, Russia Federation 10 centres, Thailand 2 
centres, United Kingdom 10 centres, United States of America 22 centres). 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were identical to those of Study F2306, with the addition of the following 
exclusion  criterion:  History  of  hypersensitivity  to  the  study  drug  or  its  excipient  or  to  drugs  of  similar 
chemical classes. 
Treatments

Figure 8. Schematic of Study F2312 design 
At baseline, patients were randomized to one of the following 4 treatment arms in a ratio of 1:1:1:1: 
•  Group 1: Secukinumab 75 mg (0.5 mL) plus placebo (2 x 1.0 mL) at BSL, Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4, 
followed by dosing every 4 weeks starting at Week 4. 
•  Group 2: Secukinumab 150 mg (1.0 mL) plus placebo (0.5 mL and 1.0 mL) at BSL, Weeks 1, 2, 3 
and 4, followed by dosing every 4 weeks starting at Week 4. 
•  Group 3: Secukinumab 300 mg (2 × 1.0 mL) plus placebo (0.5 mL) at BSL, Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4, 
followed by dosing every 4 weeks starting at Week 4. 
•  Group 4: Placebo (2 × 1.0 mL and 1× 0.5 mL) at BSL, Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by dosing 
every 4 weeks starting at Week 4. 
At  Week  16,  patients  were  classified  as  responders  (ACR20  response  defined  as  ≥  20%  improvement 
from baseline in both tender and swollen joint counts) or non-responders. Patients who were randomized 
to Groups 1, 2, and 3 continued to receive study treatment as described above regardless of responder 
status.  Patients  who  were  randomized  to  placebo  at  baseline  were  re-randomized  by  the  Interactive 
Response Technology (IRT) to receive double-blind treatment up to 52 weeks, as follows: 
•  Group 4: Placebo patients who were non-responders were re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
secukinumab 150 mg sc or 300 mg sc every 4 weeks. 
•  Group 4: Placebo patients who were responders continued to receive placebo every 4 weeks until 
Week  24.  Starting  at  Week  24,  these  patients  received  secukinumab  150  mg  sc  or  300  mg  sc 
(1:1) every 4 weeks regardless of responder status (as dictated by the re-randomization).

All study treatments were self-administered by the patients at the study site up to Week 104. After Week 
104,  the  patients  were  allowed  to  self-administer  the  PFS  at  home  during  the  optional  visits  in  which 
there were no scheduled site assessments. 
At Week 24, efficacy of secukinumab treatment was assessed based on an ACR20 response.  
According  to  the  investigational  plan,  response  to  study  treatment  was  also  assessed  at  the  Week  52 
visit. Un-blinding is planned after the Week 52 analysis was conducted in order to eliminate the placebo 
injection.  Responders  (ACR20  response)  patients  continued  in  the  post  Week  52  open-label  long-term 
treatment  period  on  the  same  treatment  dose  and  regimen  (secukinumab  75  mg,  150  mg  or  300  mg 
every 4 weeks) until Week 256 and non-responder patients will be discontinued the study. 
Objectives, Outcomes/endpoints 
The objectives, primary and secondary endpoints of the study were similar to those of study F2306 with 
an additional comparison between the 300 mg dose and placebo while no assessment of joint/bone 
structural damage was performed. 
Sample size 
A  5%  two-sided  type  I  error  rate  was  used  to  control  for  type  I  error.  Three  secukinumab  doses  were 
tested versus placebo with respect to the primary endpoint (ACR20 response at Week 24), thus the type-
I-error  was  split  to  1.7%  two-sided  for  each  comparison.  Sample  sizes  were  based  on  this  type  I  error 
assumption. 
The  overall  placebo  rate  was  expected  to  be  21%  and  the  overall  rate  on  a  dose  of  secukinumab  was 
expected to be 47%. For the primary endpoint of ACR20 response in the FAS population, 100 patients per 
group would yield approximately 92% power to detect a treatment difference of 26% (Fisher’s exact test, 
NQuery 7.0). 
Randomisation 
At  baseline,  all  eligible  patients  were  randomized  via  IRT  to  one  of  four  treatment  arms.  At  Week  16, 
patients  were  classified  as  responders  or  non-responders.  Patients  who  were  randomised  to  placebo  at 
baseline were re-randomised to receive double-blind treatment up to 52 weeks. 
The patients were stratified at randomization according to either TNFα-IR or TNFα inhibitor naïve patients. 
Approximately  40%  of  randomized  patients  should  be  TNFα-IR  to  ensure  a  representative  patient 
population for the assessment of efficacy and safety. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind, double-dummy study. 
Statistical methods 
See the methods described for study F2306. 
For  binary  variables  (e.g.,  ACR20  response)  a  logistic  regression  model  was  fitted  with  treatment  and 
TNFα-inhibitor  status  as  factors  and  baseline  score  (if  appropriate)  and  weight  as  covariates.  In  cases 
where  separation  was  a  concern  at  Week  24  time-point,  e.g.,  0%  response  in  one  treatment  (sub)-

group, an exact logistic regression model was applied. Fisher’s exact test was applied for situations where 
separation issues caused both logistic regression and exact logistic regression to fail. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 397 patients were randomized to 4 treatment groups: secukinumab 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg, 
and  placebo.  Of  the  total  randomized,  373  (94.0%)  patients  completed  24  weeks  of  treatment.  More 
patients  in  the  placebo  group  (10.2%)  discontinued  treatment  compared  with  all  of  the  secukinumab 
groups  (range:  3.0%-6.1%).  Of  the  98  patients  in  the  placebo  group,  88  patients  completed  Week  24 
and were re-randomized (1:1) (Table 10). 
For  the  24  patients  who  discontinued  at  Week  24,  the  most  common  reason  for  premature 
discontinuation  was  AEs,  which  occurred  at  a  higher  rate  in  the  placebo  group  compared  with 
secukinumab groups. 
The  number  of  patients  who  reported  at  least  1  protocol  deviation  up  to  Week  24  was  lower  in  the 
secukinumab 75 mg group compared with the rest of the treatment groups (13.1% vs 15.0-18.4%). The 
most common categories for protocol deviations up to Week 24 were Good Clinical Practices (GCP) related 
deviations, followed by prohibited concomitant medication and selection criteria not met.

F2312) 
Recruitment 
Study initiation date: 14-Apr-2013 (first patient first visit) 
Study completion date: Not applicable (last patient Visit 12/ Week 24 for interim analysis was on 12-May-
2014) 
The primary endpoint analysis (Week 24 analysis) was performed after all patients had completed Week 
24  visit.  Additional  analyses  are  planned  for  regulatory  submission  and/or  publication  purposes  after  all 
patients have completed year 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.  
Conduct of the study 
The original study protocol (dated 15-Oct-2012) was amended once (25-Feb-2014). 
There were no changes to study conduct. The following changes were made in the planned analysis:

• 
Prior  to  database  lock,  logistic  regression  was  planned  for  binary  endpoints.  However,  low 
response rates due to small sample sizes for a few subgroup analyses (e.g., by TNFα-IR status or 
concomitant  MTX  use)  caused  separation  (ie,  convergence)  issues  when  applying  logistic 
regression.  The  planned  alternative  method,  exact  logistic  regression,  was  applied  but  also  did 
not  converge.  A  second  alternative  method,  Fisher’s  exact  test,  was  therefore  proposed  and 
applied  for  situations  where  separation  issues  caused  both  logistic  regression  and  exact  logistic 
regression to fail. 
•  An  additional  data-driven  analysis  was  explored  to  determine  the  effect  of  weight  on  ACR20 
response with a <100 kg and ≥100 kg cutoff. Interactions between treatment and other baseline 
covariates  for  ACR20  response  at  Week  24  show  weight  may  have  a  possible  association  with 
ACR20  response.  Therefore,  both  a  table  and  a  figure  were  created  showing  ACR20  response 
through Week 24 by the 100 kg weight cutoff. 
Baseline data 
Baseline  demographics  were  generally  balanced  across  the  treatment  groups.  The  majority  of  patients 
were  <  65  years  of  age  with  a  mean  age  of  approximately  48  years.  More  than  half  of  the  population 
were  female  (51.6%).  Overall,  the  female to  male ratio  was  equal  in  the  groups  except  for  the  placebo 
group  which  had  60.2%  female  and  39.8%  male  patients.  Over  90%  of  patients  were  white  and  more 
than 80% were not Hispanic or Latino. Around 20% were smokers at baseline.

Numbers analysed 
The following analysis sets were used for the data analysis: Randomised set; Full analysis set (FAS); and 
Safety  set.  The  total  number  of  patients  in  each  analysis  set  was  397.  The  number  of  patients  by 
treatment group was 99 in the secukinumab 75 mg group, 100 in the secukinumab 150 mg group, 100 in 
the secukinumab 300 mg group, and 98 in the placebo group (Table 12). Among the 98 placebo-treated 
subjects, 88 were treated with secukinumab after re-randomization. 
Efficacy analyses were performed on an intent-to-treat basis, involving all 397 randomized patients who 
were assigned to study treatment (FAS). 
Table 12. Analysis sets by treatment sequence (Randomised set, Study F2312) 
Outcomes and estimation 
The primary efficacy variable ACR20 response using non-responder imputation for the FAS at Week 24 is 
shown in Table 13 and Figure 9. Secukinumab 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg were statistically superior to 
placebo at Week 24 using the pre-defined statistical testing hierarchy. Thus, the primary endpoint of this 
study was met. The ACR20 response rates at Week 24 were 29.3% for secukinumab 75 mg (p=0.0399; 
adjusted  p-value),  51.0%  for  secukinumab  150  mg  (p<0.0001),  and  54.0%  for  secukinumab  300  mg 
(p<0.0001)  compared  with  15.3%  for  placebo.  The  magnitude  of  the  treatment  effect  vs  placebo  was 
similar between the secukinumab 150 mg and 300 mg dose groups.

Secondary efficacy results 
The results of the hypothesis tests within the testing strategy are shown in Table 14. Based on adjusted 
p-values,  all  secondary  endpoints  at  Week  24  were  met  with  the  secukinumab  300  mg  dose  group 
compared  with  placebo.  For  secukinumab  150  mg  dose  group  compared  with  placebo,  all  secondary 
endpoints  were  met  with  the  exception  of  HAQ-DI  and  ACR50.  The  ACR50  treatment  effect  for 
secukinumab  150  mg  vs  placebo  was  similar  to  that  of  the  secukinumab  300  mg,  but  it  was  not  tested 
because the ACR50 was placed after HAQ-DI in the hierarchy and the HAQ-DI did not achieve statistical 
significance  (p=0.0555).    None  of  the  secondary  endpoints  were  met  with  secukinumab  75  mg  dose 
group  compared  with  placebo.  The  pooled  hypotheses  for  dactylitis  and  enthesitis  were  not  tested; 
however, the nominal p-values for the 150mg and 300mg showed a benefit for secukinumab vs placebo.  
Table 14. Results for primary and secondary endpoints based on hierarchical testing 
sequence (Full Analysis Set – Study F2312) 
PASI75  and  PASI90  response  was  assessed  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  who  had ≥  3%  of  body  surface 
area (BSA) affected by psoriatic skin involvement at baseline. For both PASI75 and PASI90 response, the 
difference  compared  with  placebo  at  Week  24  was  statistically  significant  for  the  secukinumab  150  mg 
and  300  mg  treatment  (PASI75:  48.3%,  p=0.0006  and  63.4%,  p<0.0001;  PASI90:  32.8%,  p=0.0029 
and 48.8%, p=0.0002, respectively). 
For  DAS28-CRP  change  from  baseline,  a  statistically  significant  difference  relative  to  placebo  was 
observed  for  the  secukinumab  150  mg  and  300  mg  doses  at  Week  24  (p=0.0008  and  p=0.0004)  and 
response for these 2 dose levels were similar (-1,58 and -1.61, respectively, compared to placebo -0.96). 
For SF-36 PCS scores, a clear dose-response rate was observed for the 150 mg and 300 mg dose groups 
relative to placebo at most visits, including the Week 24 visit. Changes in the secukinumab 75 mg, 150 
mg  and  300  mg  groups  at  Week  24  were  4.38,  6.39  and  7.25,  respectively,  and  1.95  in  the  placebo 
group.  Differences  in  mean  change  from  baseline  were  statistically  significant  for  all  the  3  secukinumab 
dose levels (p=0.0482, p=0.0003, and p<0.0001, respectively). 
The  changes  from  baseline  for  the  HAQ-DI  score  were  higher  in  the  150  mg  and  300  mg  dose  groups 
compared  with  placebo  at  most  visits  including  the  Week  24  visit  (-0.48  and  -0.56,  respectively; 
p=0.0278 and p=0.0013, respectively).

ACR50  responder  rates  were  highest  in  the  secukinumab  150  mg  and  300  mg  group  compared  with 
placebo (p<0.0001 for both 150 mg and 300 mg) and Week 24 responder rates for these 2 dose levels 
were similar. ACR50 responder rates were also higher in the 75 mg compared with placebo at Week 24 
(p=0.0245). 
Placebo  had  a  greater  percentage  of  patients  without  dactylitis  resolution  compared  with  secukinumab 
pooled dose in the dactylitis subset (i.e., patients who had dactylitis at baseline) at Week 24 (p=0.0114). 
Overall,  the  percentage  of  patients  without  resolution  of  dactylitis  at  Week  24  was  69.7%,  50.0%, 
43.5%, 53.2%, and 85.2% for secukinumab 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg, secukinumab pooled, and placebo 
groups,  respectively.  These  differences  vs  placebo  were  also  greater  for  the  comparison  of  the  150  mg 
and 300 mg dose groups vs placebo (p=0.0056 and p=0.0021, respectively). 
Placebo had a greater percentage of patients without resolution of enthesitis compared with secukinumab 
pooled  dose  in  the  enthesitis  subset  (i.e.,  patients  who  had  enthesitis  at  baseline)  at  Week  24 
(p=0.0060). Overall, the percentage of patients without resolution of enthesitis at Week 24 was 67.6%, 
57.8%, 51.8%, 59.6%, and 78.5% for secukinumab 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg, secukinumab pooled, and 
placebo groups, respectively. At Week 24, these differences vs placebo were also greater for the 150 mg 
and  300  mg  dose  groups  vs  placebo  (p=0.0108  and  p=0.0025,  respectively).  P-values  quoted  for 
enthesitis and dactylitis are unadjusted for multiplicity.

Notes 
Results  of  the  primary  endpoint  as  well  as  the  secondary  endpoints 
ranking highest in the testing hierarchy have been included.  
Analysis performed across trials  
The data from the 2 Phase 3 trials (F2306 and F2312) were pooled to evaluate the primary and 
secondary treatment effect across subgroups. Subgroups examined were age, gender, race, region, 
weight, TNFα inhibitor status, number of prior TNFα inhibitors, reasons for stopping TNFα inhibitors, 
baseline DAS28 status, concomitant corticosteroid use, concomitant methotrexate use, baseline HAQ-DI; 
baseline CRP, baseline BSA. When pooling was performed the ‘AIN457 Pooled’ group constituted of iv-75 
mg, iv-150 mg, 150 mg sc and 300 mg sc, and the 75 mg sc dose from Study CAIN457F2312 was 
excluded. The MAH justified the pooling of the iv-75 mg, iv-150 mg, 150 mg sc, and 300 mg sc dose 
groups (while leaving out 75 mg sc) by the similarity in response rates for the primary and key secondary 
endpoints for these groups.   
The results from the pooling approach are briefly summarized in the Forest plots below.

Supportive studies 
A subset of 363 (18%) patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and concomitant PsA from 2 
phase 3 moderate to severe plaque psoriasis trials (Study CAIN457A2302 and CAIN457A2303) was 
pooled to provide additional information on selected endpoints (HAQ-DI, PASI75 and PASI90) for 
secukinumab 150 mg sc and 300 mg sc dose regimens. 
Among moderate to severe plaque psoriasis patients with concomitant PsA, greater improvements in 
physical functioning, as measured by the mean change in HAQ-DI score from baseline (comparison with 
placebo up to Week 12), were observed with secukinumab 300 mg from both studies A2302 and A2303. 
For both studies, the mean HAQ-DI score at baseline was comparable across the treatment groups. In 
Study A2302, the mean change in HAQ-DI score at Week 12 was -0.18, and -0.35 for those patients 
treated with secukinumab 150 mg and 300 mg, respectively, compared with -0.08 for placebo. In Study 
A2303, the mean change in HAQ-DI score at Week 12 was -0.19, and -0.41 for those patients treated 
with secukinumab 150 mg and 300 mg, respectively.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The PsA clinical development program includes two phase II studies (A2206 in PsA patients and F2201 in 
a related arthritic indication with RA patients) and two pivotal phase III studies PsA (F2306 and F2312). 
Pivotal  efficacy  data  up  to  Week  24  (Study  F2312)  and  up  to  Week  52  (Study  F2306)  have  been 
provided.  In  addition,  data  on  a  subset  of  363  psoriasis  patients  with  concomitant  PsA  from  psoriasis 
Studies A2302 and A2303 have been pooled to obtain information on selected endpoints (HAQ-DI, PASI 
75/90; the latter study also included active comparator etanercept). In addition, follow-up data from five 
phase  III  psoriasis  studies  have  been  provided  with  the  target  secukinumab  doses  of  150  mg  and  300 
mg. 
Recommendations of the EMA clinical guidance for psoriatic arthritis (Guideline on clinical investigation of 
medicinal  products  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  psoriatic  arthritis,  CHMP/EWP/438/04)  have  mostly 
been taken into account in the clinical development programme.  
The initial doses and the dosing regimen in phase II studies were based on preclinical in vivo efficacy data 
in animal models which were evaluated during the initial MAA for Cosentyx.  
The  two  phase  II  studies  A2206  and  F2201  provided  preliminary  evidence  of  efficacy  in  two  arthritic 
disease models, PsA and RA. The posology carried forward to the phase III studies was mainly based on 
PK/PD modelling and simulation of different treatment regimens as well as data in psoriasis. 
The  study  population  in  phase  III  studies  consisted  of  adults  with  active  moderate  to  severe  PsA.  They 
fulfilled  the  CASPAR  diagnostic  criteria  for  PsA  and  the  disease  activity  was  based  on  3  or  more  tender 
joints and 3 or more swollen joints.  
Study  F2306  was  a  double-blind,  randomized,  parallel-group,  placebo-controlled  study.  The  52-week 
interim analyses of the 2-year study was provided, with the assessment of the primary efficacy variable 
of ACR20 response at Week 24. Loading regimen was secukinumab 10 mg/kg iv at baseline and at Weeks 
2 and 4, followed by maintenance treatment with 75 mg or 150 mg sc q4w. The efficacy variables chosen 
covered relevant aspects of the disease except for the lack of dedicated assessment of axial involvement. 
The MAH was requested to discuss this issue and present any efficacy data available with respect to axial 
arthritis  or  any  evidence  that  efficacy  can  be  extrapolated  to  this  sub-group  of  PsA  patients.  The  MAH 
noted  that  only  a  small  number  of  PsA  patients  within  the  studies  had  axial  involvement,  and  therefore

assessments  of  axial  involvement  would  have  been  difficult  to  demonstrate  meaningful  data.  However, 
the  MAH  considered  that  data  from  the  AS  studies  which  show  a  clear  effect  of  secukinumab  on  key 
measures  of  efficacy  related  to  axial  involvement  and  overall  physical  function  could  be  extrapolated  to 
the  PsA  patients.  The  CHMP  agreed  that  PsA  and  AS  represent  spondyloarthritides  with  some  clinical 
overlap and therefore considering the overall weight of evidence on the efficacy of secukinumab in both 
PsA  and  AS,  such  extrapolation  was  considered  meaningful.  A  statement  on  the  low  number  of  PsA 
patients with axial involvement was included in Section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
The design of Study F2312 was identical to that of Study F2306, but the iv loading regimen in the latter 
study  was  replaced  by  a  sc  loading  regimen  that  is  similar  to  the  one  approved  for  the  treatment  of 
psoriasis (sc dosing at baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4 and then q4w). Also, an additional 300 mg sc dose 
arm was included. No assessment of progression of structural damage was performed in this study.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
For  Study  F2306,  202  patients  were  randomized  to  each  of  the  3  treatment  groups  (secukinumab  10 
mg/kg-75  mg,  secukinumab  10  mg/kg-150  mg  and  placebo).  Baseline  disease  activity  was  consistent 
with moderate to severe PsA and generally comparable across the treatment groups. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was achieved as secukinumab at both 10 mg/kg-75 mg and 10 mg/kg-150 
mg doses was statistically significantly superior to placebo for ACR20 response at Week 24 (p<0.0001). 
The ACR20 response rates at Week 24 were 50.5% for secukinumab 75 mg, 50.0% for secukinumab 150 
mg  and  17.3%  for  placebo.  Superior  response  rates  compared  to  placebo  were  seen  as  early  as  from 
Week 1 onwards, with p-values <0.0001 at each time point. 
For Study  F2312,  a  total of  397  patients  were  randomized to  4 treatment  groups:  secukinumab  75  mg, 
150 mg, 300 mg, and placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was achieved as secukinumab at all doses 
was  statistically  significantly  superior  to  placebo  for  ACR20  response  at  Week  24  (p<0.0001  for 
secukinumab  150  mg  and  300  mg  vs.  placebo,  p=0.0200  for  secukinumab  75  mg  vs.  placebo).  The 
ACR20 response rates at Week 24 were 29.3% for secukinumab 75 mg, 51.0% for secukinumab 150 mg, 
54.0  for  secukinumab  300  mg  and  15.3%  for  placebo.  For  the  150  mg  and  300  mg  doses,  statistically 
superior response rates compared to placebo were seen from Week 3 onwards. 
All secondary endpoints at Week 24 were met with the 300 mg dose group compared with placebo. For 
the  150  mg  dose  group,  secondary  endpoints  within  the  testing  hierarchy  were  met  until  HAQ-DI.  For 
ACR50  (placed  after  HAQ-DI  in  the  hierarchy),  the  treatment  effect  was  however  similar  to  that  of  the 
300  mg  dose.  Among  exploratory  endpoints,  relevant  improvements  in  quality  of  life  were  noted  with 
both secukinumab 150 mg and 300 mg doses. 
ACR20,  ACR50  and  ACR70  response  rates  at  Week  24  were  higher  in  TNFα  inhibitor  naïve  patients 
compared with TNFα-IR patients. This is consistent with secukinumab data in psoriasis and also a general 
phenomenon in biological therapies. The subgroup analysis by TNFα inhibitor status at Week 24 provided 
evidence  that  the  ACR20  response  rates  in  TNFα-IR  patients  are  better  with  the  300  mg  dose.  The 
updated  Week  52  efficacy  data  confirmed  these  results.  Therefore,  for  TNFα-IR  patients  the 
recommended dose is 300 mg sc. 
Based  on  temporal  efficacy  data,  a  time  point  earlier  than  24  weeks  could  have  been  chosen  for  the 
assessment  of  the  primary  endpoint.  55  placebo  patients  were  re-randomized  at  Week  16  and  were 
treated as MAR at Week 24 in the MMRM analyses. The MAH was requested to discuss the validity of the 
time point chosen for the primary endpoint analysis.  
The  MAH  responded  that  the  time  point  for  the  assessment  of  the  primary  endpoint  at  24  weeks  was 
based  on  the  EMA  guideline  and  the  need  to  harmonize  the  efficacy  and  the  structural  damage 
assessments.  In  addition,  it  was  considered  that  the  more  stringent  endpoints  like  ACR70  and  DAS-28 
Assessment report

remission  need  longer  time  to  become  evident.  As  the  placebo  escape  for  non-responders  at  Week  16 
may  have  resulted  in  potential  bias,  further  sensitivity  analyses  were  performed  at  Week  24  where  the 
actual data from patients who were switched from placebo to active treatment at week 16 were analysed 
as placebo. In these analyses the conclusions of the clinical study report remained valid. 
The  MAH  proposed  a  time  point  of  16  weeks  for  consideration  to  discontinue  treatment  in  patients  who 
have shown no response and this was agreed by the CHMP and is reflected in Section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Within  analyses  performed  across  trials,  similar  efficacy  at  Week  24  based  on  ACR  20,  50  and  70 
responses was seen for both iv-75 mg and iv-150 mg dose groups in Study F2306. These results suggest 
a significant contribution of the iv loading dose to ACR response at Week 24. However, the doses began 
to separate around Week 32, and by Week 52, the ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses were approximately 3%, 
10% and 3% higher in the iv-150 mg dose group. Similar separation at Week 32 was also seen in PASI 
75 and 90 responses. In  Study F2312, a clear difference in efficacy between the 75 mg sc regimen and 
the higher 150/300 mg sc dose regimens was evident. The 75 mg dose was statistically not significantly 
different to placebo, and it was clinically inferior to the 150 mg and 300 mg doses. The MAH was asked to 
provide an explanation for these observations. The MAH provided a simulated secukinumab concentration 
profile,  illustrating  the  overriding  contribution  of  the  iv  loading  regimen  towards  exposure  for  the 
respective 75 mg and 150 mg sc dosing regimens over the first 24 weeks of the study (although minor 
differences  in  exposure  resulting  from  these  regimens  are  predicted  starting  from  Week  8).  The  CHMP 
agreed that this obscured the possibility to observe a dose-response during this period of time. 
Several  analyses  were  done  in  subpopulations  across  secukinumab  150  mg  (n=100),  secukinumab  300 
mg (n=100), secukinumab pooled (n=604) and placebo pooled (n=300) groups.  
In  the  analysis  by  weight,  ACR20  response  was  decreased  in  patients  weighing  ≥90  kg.  However,  it 
seemed  that  other  endpoints  including  the  more  clinically  relevant  and  more  stringent  ACR  50  and  70 
responses were similar between the doses of 150 mg and 300 mg. The MAH provided further data based 
on  weight  groups,  stratified  by  TNF-a  status  from  study  F2312.  For  the  TNF-alpha  inhibitor  naïve 
subgroup of patients ≥90 kg, there was a difference in ACR 20 response at Week 24 in the 150 mg and 
300  mg  dose  groups  (50.0%  and  65.0%,  respectively)  but  not  in  the  more  stringent  endpoint  ACR50 
(43.3%  and  40.0%,  respectively).  In  the  TNFa-IR  group  at  Week  24,  the  ACR  50  response  rate  was 
higher in the ≥90 kg weight group with the 300 mg dose, in line with the proposed posology.  At Week 
52 the ACR 50 responses with both 150 mg and 300 mg dose continued to be similar within each weight 
group.  According  to  the  MAH,  the  most  clinically  relevant  factor  for  stratification  was  considered  to  be 
TNF-alpha  response  status  and  stratification  by  body  weight  was  discounted  due  to  the  resulting  very 
small  sample  sizes  per  subset.  The  MAH´s  justifications  were  accepted  by  the  CHMP  as  no  consistent 
clinically  meaningful  benefit  of  the  300  mg  dose  over  the  150  mg  dose  in  heavier  patients  could  be 
observed.  The  CHMP  therefore  concluded  that  no  dose  adjustment  based  on  body  weight  would  be 
needed.  The  higher  efficacy  observed  with  the  300  mg  dose  in  the  TNFα-IR  patients  >90kg  was 
consistent with the proposed 300 mg dose for these patients. 
Among  PsA  patients  with  psoriasis  (BSA  ≥3%),  higher  PASI75  and  PASI90  rates  were  observed  with 
secukinumab 300 mg dose compared to the 150 mg dose. This is consistent with the phase III psoriasis 
program. The difference was particularly evident in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. Therefore 
the  dosing  proposed  for  patients  with  concomitant  moderate  to  severe  plaque  psoriasis,  i.e.,  300  mg 
secukinumab by sc injection, was considered justified.  
2.4.1.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Both  phase  III  studies  met  the  primary  endpoint  as  ACR20  response  rates  with  all  secukinumab  doses 
tested  were  statistically  significantly  higher  compared  to  placebo  at  Week  24.  With  the  proposed  sc

induction  and  maintenance  regimen,  the  150  mg dose  provided  clinically  more  relevant  level of  efficacy 
compared to the 75 mg dose, in particular in the long-term treatment up to Week 52. Based on subgroup 
analyses, the 300 mg dose was considered more appropriate for patients with concomitant moderate to 
severe plaque psoriasis and for TNFα-IR patients. 
Other  endpoints  related  to  joint  and  skin  disease,  physical  function,  health-related  quality  of  life  and 
prevention  of  progression  of  structural  damage  consistently  show  clinically  relevant  efficacy  of 
secukinumab in the treatment of PsA.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The secukinumab development program studied 7048 patients, including 6200 patients exposed to at 
least one dose of secukinumab in any indication, and 6267 patient-years of secukinumab exposure, are 
included in the safety pooling (Table 18). The safety data in the present submission provide an 
additional 2679 patient-years of secukinumab exposure (75% increase), including 955 patient-years of 
exposure in PsA patients and 691 patient-years of exposure in AS patients, beyond the 3588 patient-
years of exposure reported previously for the psoriasis development program.

Pool A consisted of 2 pivotal placebo-controlled Phase 3 trials (F2306 and F2312) in PsA with placebo and 
dose  comparisons  that  allow  risks  to  be  evaluated  in  the  PsA  population  during  the  first  16  weeks  of 
treatment,  which  was  the  placebo-controlled  phase,  and  during  the  entire  treatment  period  (median  48 
weeks of exposure to secukinumab, interim analyses on week 52 in study F2306 and on week 24 in study 
F2312). 
Pool B1 included an expanded PsA population with PsA patients from the 2 Phase 3 PsA trials, F2306 and 
F2312,  and  psoriasis  patients  with  concomitant  PsA  from  3  Phase  3  psoriasis  trials,  A2302,  A2303,  and 
A2304). 
Pool B (a mixed population of PsA patients from the 2 Phase 3 PsA trials, F2306 and F2312, and psoriasis 
patients  from  the  5  Phase  3  psoriasis  trials  A2302,  A2303,  A2304,  A2308,  and  A2309)  increased  the

probability of observing less common events over long-term treatment for the target doses of 150 mg sc 
and 300 mg sc. 
Pool C, the largest data pool, includes all patients treated with secukinumab in 42 studies and maximised  
the probability of observing rare events in patients receiving secukinumab. 
Induction and placebo-controlled study period of Pool A 
The overall incidence of AEs during the loading period from Weeks 0 to 8 did not indicate differences in 
tolerability across the secukinumab 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg sc and pooled 10 mg/kg iv loading group 
or to placebo. A similar AE profile was observed for Weeks 0 to 16 (Table 19).

Entire studies 
The  overall  exposure-adjusted  incidence  of  AEs  in  the  entire  treatment  period  of  Pool  A  was  similar 
between the any 300 mg and any 150 mg secukinumab groups and lower in the any 75 mg group (Table 
20). The exposure-adjusted AE rate for the placebo group was higher, reflecting the shorter duration of 
exposure for the placebo group in presence of decreasing reported rates over time. Taking account of the 
differences in duration of exposure over the entire treatment period, the general profile of AEs over the 
entire treatment period was similar to the initial 16-week treatment period, with no new involvement of 
SOCs over long-term treatment than was seen in the first 16 weeks of treatment. For many events, the 
rates  for  the  any  300  mg  group  were  comparable  to  or  lower  than  for  placebo,  indicating  no  clinically 
meaningful increase in risk was observed for 300 mg over the entire treatment period. 
Apparent  small  dose-related  increases  were  seen  for  infections  (URTI,  bronchitis,  sinusitis,  pharyngitis, 
oral  herpes,  conjunctivitis),  and  ruritus,  rash,  increased  ALT,  gastroesophageal  reflux  disease,  alopecia, 
palpitations, and epistaxis. In many cases rates for the 300 mg group were comparable to or lower than 
for placebo. 
There were no meaningful differences between secukinumab groups in the distribution of AEs over time. 
AEs overall and most infection AEs and gastrointestinal AEs showed an overall trend of a decrease in the 
proportion of patients reporting AEs over time across treatment groups. This observation could be made 
both from Pool A and Pool B.

For patients with event, exposure time is censored at time of first event 
The exposure adjusted incidence rates of these AEs did not show dose-related differences for the 150 mg 
and 300 mg groups with sc-loading (in study F2312) with the exception of headache (IR=8.6 vs. 11.8), 
sinusitis (IR=5.6 vs. 8.4), oral herpes (IR=0 vs. 5.7), pharyngitis (IR=0 vs. 5.5), and epistaxis (IR=1.4 
vs. 4.1). 
In Pool B, the overall exposure-adjusted incidence of AEs were similar for the 150 mg and 300 mg groups 
(IR=247.1  and  250.4,  respectively),  suggesting  the  absence  of  a  dose-response.  AE  rates  were  highest 
for  the  placebo  group  (IR=329.6),  reflecting  the  lower  exposure  in  this  group.  Exposure-adjusted 
incidence rates of AEs for most SOCs were similar for the 150 mg and 300 mg groups. A higher rate of 
respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  for the  Any  300  mg  group  compared  to  the  Any  150  mg 
group  (IR=21.0  vs.  13.9,  respectively)  reflected  higher  rates  of  cough  (IR=6.7  vs.  4.3)  and 
oropharyngeal pain (IR=5.8 vs. 3.5). 
In Pool B the majority of AEs by preferred term were reported with comparable exposure-adjusted rates 
for the 150 mg and 300 mg secukinumab dose groups (Table 21).

Adverse Drug Reactions 
During  the  first  16  weeks  (Pool  A),  the  incidence  of  treatment  related  AEs  in  the  300  mg  secukinumab 
dose group was higher compared to placebo (25.0%, 18.0%, and 21.2% for 300 mg, 150 mg and 75 mg, 
respectively, vs. 20.7% for placebo), due to a higher rate of infections and infestations (13.0%, 12.0%, 
and 11.1% for 300 mg, 150 mg and 75 mg, respectively, vs. 9.0% for placebo). This was driven by small 
differences between treatment groups for individual treatment-related infections, in particular respiratory 
tract infection (2.0% for 300 mg vs. 0% for 150 mg, 75 mg and placebo groups) and oral herpes (2.0% 
for  300  mg  vs.  0%  for  150  mg,  1.0%  for  75  mg  and  0%  for  placebo  groups).  A  small  increase  in 
treatment-related AEs in the 300 mg secukinumab dose group was also seen for skin and subcutaneous

tissue  disorders  (5.0%,  1.0%,  and  2.0%  for  300  mg,  150  mg,  and  75  mg,  respectively,  vs.  3.3%  for 
placebo), although this was not driven by individual events. 
During  the  entire treatment  period  for  Pool  A,  there  was  a  higher  overall incidence  of  treatment-related 
AEs  in  the  secukinumab  dose  groups  compared  to  placebo  (29.0%,  31.7%  and  28.9%  for  Any  300  mg, 
Any  150  mg  and 75  mg  groups,  respectively,  vs.  21.3%  for  placebo),  due to a  higher  rate  of infections 
and infestations (16.6%, 20.8%, and 17.9% for 300 mg, 150 mg and 75 mg, respectively, vs. 9.7% for 
placebo).  Upper  respiratory  tract  infection  and  nasopharyngitis,  the  most  common  infections,  as  well  as 
respiratory  tract  infections,  urinary  tract  infections,  sinusitis,  oral  herpes,  bronchitis,  and  pharyngitis 
occurring at low rates, contributed to this imbalance. No dose response for secukinumab was seen in the 
total rate or in any event considered possibly related to study treatment. 
AEs causing dose interruption or adjustment  
As for Pool A, the overall incidence of patients with AEs causing dose interruption in Pool B did not show a 
dose  increase  across  the  secukinumab  dose  groups  (5.3%  and  6.0%  for  the  Any  300  mg  and  Any  150 
mg,  respectively,  and  3.3%  for  placebo).  The  most  common  AEs  causing  dose  interruption  were  for 
infections and infestations and did not show a dose increase across the secukinumab dose groups (3.2% 
and  3.5%,  respectively,  for  the  Any  300  mg  and  Any  150  mg  groups  vs.  1.6%  for  placebo).  Individual 
AEs  causing  dose  interruption  were  reported  for  few  patients  and  were  comparable  across  treatment 
groups. 
For the entire treatment period of Pool A, the overall incidence of AEs requiring concomitant  medication 
was  lowest  for  the  secukinumab  sc  dose  groups  compared  to  the  iv  dose  groups  (57.0%,  62.0%  and 
47.5%,  respectively,  for  the  300  mg,  150  mg  and  75  mg  sc  groups  vs.  74.3-76.7%  for  the  iv  loading 
groups,  45.3%  for  placebo).  This  difference  was  due  to  infections  and  infestations  (38.0%,  42.0%  and 
29.3%,  respectively,  for  the  300  mg,  150  mg  and  75  mg  vs.  51.0-54.5%  for  the  iv  loading  groups, 
20.7% for placebo), mainly as a result of a higher rate of upper respiratory tract infections. 
Crohn´s disease 
Of the 4 cases of IBD in pool A (Table 22), 2 cases were Crohn’s disease (1 placebo patient – on baseline 
- and 1 patient on 75 mg).  
Table 22. Exposure-adjusted incidence of inflammatory bowel disease – Entire 
treatment period (Pool A: Phase 3 PsA trials – Safety set) 
Infections and infestations 
Consistent  with  the  psoriasis  program,  there  was  a small increase  in the  risk of  localized  (non-invasive) 
clinically  manageable  candidiasis,  which  was  expected  due  to  the  role  of  IL-17A  in  immunity  to  fungal 
infections. A dose effect was apparent only in the entire treatment period (Pool A). Candida cases were all 
mild  or  moderate  in  severity,  responsive  to  standard  treatment  and  did  not  lead  to  discontinuation. 
Esophageal  candidiasis  was  reported  in  2  PsA  patients,  one  in  each  of  the  150  mg  and  300  mg 
secukinumab dose groups. Both cases of esophageal candidiasis were mild or moderate in severity, non-

serious  and  resolved  upon  treatment  with  standard  antifungal  medication  without  requiring 
discontinuation of secukinumab. 
In  Pool  A,  herpes  viral  infections  (HLT)  occurred  in  a  higher  proportion  of  patients  in  the  Any  300  mg 
group (4.8%) than in the other secukinumab dose groups (3.1% and 3.4% for Any 75 mg and Any 150 
mg, respectively). Crude incidence of herpes viral infections (HLT) for the placebo group was 1.3%. The 
higher rate in the Any 300 mg group was due to oral herpes (3.4% for Any 300 mg vs. 1.8% and 2.7%, 
respectively, for Any 75 mg and Any 150 mg groups). All cases of oral herpes were of mild or moderate 
severity,  were  not  SAEs  and  did  not  require  study  drug  discontinuation.  There  was  one  case  of  herpes 
zoster  cutaneous  disseminated,  also  an  event  in  the  opportunistic  infections  NMQ,  in  a  patient  on  iv-75 
mg secukinumab. 
There  were  no  serious  opportunistic  infections,  and  no  cases  of  reactivation  of  either  tuberculosis  or 
Hepatitis B. 
The most common infections of skin structures reported in pool A are presented in Table 23. 
Table 23. Exposure-adjusted incidence rate of adverse drug reactions (Pool A entire 
treatment period: Phase 3 PsA trials – Safety set) 
Malignancies and skin tumours 
Results  from  the  PsA  population  continue  to  support  the  conclusion  from  the  psoriasis  program  that 
secukinumab  does  not  confer  an  increased  risk  for  malignancy.  The  incidence  of  malignancies  including 
skin tumours was low and comparable across the secukinumab dose groups and placebo. 
Malignancy  SAEs  occurred  at  a  low  and  comparable  exposure-adjusted  incidence  rate  in  the  Any 
secukinumab dose and placebo groups (IR: 0.3 vs. 0.9) (Table 24).

New malignancies from the psoriasis studies are from the ongoing studies A2308 and A2309, reported in 
the Week 52 study reports provided in the present submission, and include the following: 
• 
Two uncomplicated cases of basal cell carcinoma  
•  One case of adenosquamous cell carcinoma, confounded by relevant medical history 
•  One  case  of  B-cell  lymphoma  for  which  the  investigator  reported  the  event  as  suspected  to  be 
related  to  study  treatment  but  also  suspected  to  be  related  to  past  treatment  of  tofacitinib  and 
ustekinumab. 
Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) 
Data from the Phase 3 program in PsA do not suggest an increased risk of MACE in PsA patients treated 
with secukinumab. In the psoriasis submission, secukinumab was comparable to placebo in the incidence 
of  MACE  in  the  first  12  weeks  of  treatment  as  well as  over  the  entire  treatment  period.  All  MACE  cases 
were associated with prior or active cardiovascular disease or risk factors at Baseline. There was no dose 
dependence for secukinumab. 
Consistent  with  the  psoriasis  program,  the  Phase  3  studies  in  PsA  did  not  exclude  patients  with  stable 
cardiovascular  risk  factors  from  secukinumab  treatment.  A  total  of  7  (0.7%)  adjudicated  and  confirmed 
MACE cases were reported in Pool A of PsA studies (6 cases for the 75 mg dose, and 1 case for the 150 
mg dose) (Table 25).  No MACE cases were reported for the 300 mg dose or for placebo.

Table 25. MACE adjudication results in PsA patients – Entire treatment period (Pool 
A: Phase 3 PsA trials – Safety set) 
In the present PsA submission, the rate of MACE on secukinumab across multiple indications was stable 
despite increased exposure in comparison to the psoriasis submission. Pooling across 42 studies including 
8  new  studies  reported  here  for  the  first  time,  the  exposure-adjusted  incidence  of  potential  MACE  AEs 
over the entire treatment period of all secukinumab trials (Pool C) was 0.40 (n=30, CI: 0.26 - 0.59) for 
the Any secukinumab dose group and 0.39 (n=2, CI: 0.05 - 1.40) for placebo, Figure 14.

Hepatotoxicity 
Assessment report

Consistent with the conclusions from the psoriasis program, the safety data in the PsA population do not 
suggest an increased risk for drug-induced liver injury (DILI) from secukinumab treatment. Despite small 
imbalances  in  the  incidence  of  mild  hepatic  transaminase  elevations  (CTCAE  Grade  1)  vs.  placebo, 
secukinumab at any dose in the PsA program was not associated with any cases of combined elevations 
in  hepatic  transaminases  and  serum  bilirubin.  Discontinuations  due  to  hepatotoxicity  were  rare  in 
secukinumab  treated  patients  and  all  cases  were  confounded  by  either  a  previously  reported  medical 
condition or concomitant treatment with isoniazid and methotrexate. 
QTC-prolongation 
A search for cases of QT prolongation yielded a total of 3 AEs in the PsA population, one case in each of 
the 75 mg, 150 mg, and placebo groups. No cases were reported for the 300 mg group. All 3 events were 
non-serious,  mild  or  moderate  in  severity  and  considered  unrelated  to  study  medication.  No  patient 
discontinued study medication due to the event. There were no further events of QT prolongation in the 
expanded PsA population in Pool B1 or among the psoriasis patients included in Pool B. QT prolongation is 
being monitored as a routine risk. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Four deaths were reported across data pools A, B1 and B: one death was reported for the PsA trials (Pool 
A) due to an intracranial haemorrhage in a patient receiving iv-75 mg. One further death occurred in Pool 
B1  of  unknown  cause  (300  mg  secukinumab).  Two  additional  deaths  occurred  in  psoriasis  patients 
contributing  to  Pool  B  as  a  result  of  cardiopulmonary  arrest  (150  mg  secukinumab),  and  of  alcohol 
poisoning  (placebo-secukinumab  300  mg),  respectively.  None  of  these  deaths  was  considered  by  the 
investigator to be related to study treatment. 
For Pool A studies CAIN457F2306 and CAIN457F2312, one further death was reported between the data 
cut-off  for  Pool  A  (9-Oct-2013  for  study  F2306  and  12-May-2014  for  study  F2312)  and  the  data  cut-off 
used for the submission (10-Oct-2014). 
In  studies  F2305  and  F2310  on  ankylosing  spondylitis,  there  were  three  additional  deaths  (1  in  the 
placebo group (suicide), 1 in the iv-75 mg group due to respiratory failure, and 1 in the 75 mg sc group 
due  to  an  acute  myocardial  infarction).  None  of  these  deaths  was  considered  by  the  respective 
investigators to be related to study treatment.  
Overall  exposure  adjusted  rates  of  SAEs  (Table 26)  were  similar  for the  secukinumab  dose  groups  and 
no higher than placebo. The exposure adjusted rates of infections and infestations were slightly higher for 
the  “Any  300  mg  group  compared  to  the  Any  150  mg  and  Any  75  mg  groups  (IR=4.5  vs.  2.5  and  2.2, 
respectively).  This  difference  (based  on  few  events)  was  also  seen  when  comparing  the  two  sc  loading 
doses of 150 mg (n=1, IR=1.4) and 300 mg (n=3, IR=4.2).  
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Most  newly  occurring  or  worsening  haematology-related  abnormalities  observed  for  PsA  patients  were 
CTCAE  Grade  1  or  Grade  2  abnormalities  and  were  consistent  with  findings  from  the  initial  psoriasis 
submission. The incidence of CTCAE Grade 2 and 3 laboratory abnormalities was higher in secukinumab-
treated patients compared to placebo in the initial 16 weeks of treatment. A similar pattern was observed 
over the entire treatment period and no CTCAE Grade 4 abnormalities were observed as of 10-Oct-2014. 
In the current submission for PsA, no dose effect for secukinumab was observed in lab results or in AEs.

Among  the  4  patients  with  CTCAE  Grade  3  neutropenia,  none  experienced  an  infection  any  time  during 
the  reporting  period.  Further,  neutropenia  reported  as  AEs  were  transient  (lasting  only  1  visit  and 
normalizing at the next subsequent visit) and did not result in permanent discontinuation of study drug.

These events are presented in Table 27.  The overall incidence of neutropenia was similar between the 
different loading regimens.

Clinical chemistry 
Secukinumab at any dose showed a higher rate of Grade 1 ALT elevations and of Grade 1-2 abnormalities 
in cholesterol and triglycerides compared with placebo. Rates of Grade 1 or 2 elevations in ALT, alkaline 
phosphatase, bilirubin, creatinine and GGT for secukinumab were lower than or similar to placebo. Across 
the  secukinumab  dose  groups,  higher  rates  were  not  observed  with  the 300 mg  dose,  with  the  possible 
exception  of  Grade  1  values  in  bilirubin.  The  rates  of  Grade  1  or  2  elevations  in  the  iv  loading  groups 
were comparable to or lower than the rates in the sc loading groups, suggesting no increase with higher 
exposure. 
Grade 3 elevations in ALT, AST, GGT, increased fasting serum glucose and triglycerides were noted for a 
small  number  of  patients  in  both  secukinumab  and  placebo  groups,  with  no  meaningful  difference 
between  secukinumab  and  placebo  treatments  or  across  secukinumab  doses.  Grade  4  abnormalities  in 
decreased  fasting  glucose  were  reported  for  1  (1.0%)  patients  on  150  mg  secukinumab  and  1  (0.3%) 
patient  on  placebo.  Grade  4  elevations  in  triglycerides  were  observed  in  3  (0.4%)  patients  on 
secukinumab (all with iv loading) and none on placebo. 
Grade 2 elevations in cholesterol were infrequent, but rates were slightly higher in the Any secukinumab 
dose group compared to placebo (1.6% vs. 0.3% respectively); the highest rate (4.0%) was reported in 
the iv-150 mg group. Grade 3 and 4 cholesterol abnormalities were not reported. 
Safety in special populations 
Baseline BSA 
Rates of total AEs and most SOCs were higher in patients with <10% BSA than in those with ≥10% BSA 
in all treatment groups, including the placebo group (Table 28).

period (Pool A: Phase 3 PsA trials – Safety set) 
Body weight 
No  specific  weight-related  trends  in  total  AEs  or  in  the  most  frequently  affected  SOC  of  infections  and 
infestations were observed. There were no meaningful differences by weight observed in the incidence of 
cardiac  disorders,  skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders  or  gastrointestinal  disorders  or  other  SOCs 
compared to the overall population. The incidence of SAEs was low and no weight-related trends among 
the treatment groups were observed. Serious infections and infestations were reported in a slightly higher 
proportion of patients weighing < 90 kg (n=8, 1.8% in the Any secukinumab group vs. 0% in the placebo 
group),  with  no meaningful  difference  across  dose groups,  than  in  the patients  weighing  >  90  kg  (n=1, 
0.4% in the Any secukinumab group vs. n=1, 1.1% in the placebo group). 
10-year CHD risk category 
The  majority of  patients  across  all  treatment  groups  were  in the  low  risk  category  for  10-year  CHD  risk 
(<10%).  AEs  by  CHD  risk  category  in  the  initial  treatment  period  of  Pool  A  were  consistent  with  the 
profile observed in the overall population. There was no increase in the incidence of AEs in the  SOCs of 
cardiac  disorders,  nervous  system  disorders  and  vascular  disorders  among  patients  in  the  high  10-year 
Assessment report

CHD  risk  category  (>20%)  compared  with  patients  in  the  medium  (10-20%)  or  low  (<10%)  CHD  risk 
category.  There  were  no  clinically  meaningful  differences  across  the  treatment  groups  in  any  subgroups 
of  CHD  risk.  Similar  findings  were  observed  for  SAEs  by  CHD  risk  category,  which  showed  no  specific 
trends  for  any  event  and  few  SAEs  among  the  small  number  of  patients  in  the  high  risk  category.  The 
profile of AEs for Pool A over the entire treatment period by CHD risk category was consistent with those 
observed for the overall population. Similar results were seen for SAEs in Pool A over the entire treatment 
period. 
Immunological events 
In  the  PsA  studies,  the  overall  incidence  of  immune/administration  reactions  in  the  initial  16-week 
treatment  period  was  comparable  across  the  secukinumab  and  placebo  groups.  Some  specific  events 
were  more  common  in  placebo  patients  (mainly  cough  and  rash),  while  other  events  (e.g.,  peripheral 
edema,  conjunctivitis,  mouth  ulceration,  urticaria  and  injection  site  erythema)  were  reported  with  low 
rates  in  secukinumab  patients  only.  There  were  no  reports  of  anaphylactic  reaction  in  a  secukinumab 
treated patient. With longer exposure over the entire treatment period, the overall incidence was higher 
with the 300 mg dose compared with the 150 mg dose, mainly driven by rash, pruritus and conjunctivitis. 
Results  from  the  expanded  PsA  population  and  from  the  pooled  PsA  and  psoriasis  population  supported 
these findings. 
One case of angioedema (PT) was reported. The event was non-serious, moderate in severity, lasted for 
13 days and was considered related to study medication. The patient discontinued study medication and 
recovered  from  the  event  without  requiring  treatment.  No  systemic  features  of  anaphylaxis  were 
reported. 
The  exposure  adjusted  incidence  of  the  most  frequent  immunological  AEs  over  the  entire  treatment 
period, are presented in Table 29. 
Table 29. Exposure-adjusted incidence rate of the most frequent AEs of 
immune/administration reactions (>2% in any treatment group) – Entire treatment 
period (Pool A: Phase 3 PsA trials – Safety set) 
Exposure-adjusted  incidence  rates  for  hypersensitivity  AEs  were  higher  in  the  Any  300  mg  group 
compared  with  the  Any  150  mg  and  Any  75  mg  groups  (IR=14.0  vs.  9.6  and  7.7,  respectively),  but  all 
secukinumab  doses  showed  numerically  lower  rates  than  the  placebo  group  (IR=21.7).  The  imbalance 
was mainly driven by the higher rate of rash and urticaria. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/665427/2015 
Page 71/84 
 
  
  
 
 
 
In  the  time  interval  of  0-8  weeks,  the  absolute  incidence  of  immune/administration  reactions  was 
comparable  between  the  sc  loading  (11.0%,  8.0%  and  8.1%  for  300  mg,  150  mg  and  75  mg, 
respectively) and iv loading regimens (7.9% and 10.9% for iv-75 mg and iv-150 mg, respectively), and 
slightly  lower  for  the  no-load  regimens  (6.7%,  5.1%  and  8.9%  for  75  mg,  150  mg  and  300  mg, 
respectively). 
The  profile  of  immune/administration  reactions  in  the  Phase  3  PsA  and  psoriasis  studies  (Pool  B)  was 
similar  to  that  observed  in  PsA  populations  of  Pools  A  and  B1,  also  showing  no  new  or  unexpected 
reactions with secukinumab treatment. 
Immunogenicity 
Treatment-emergent  ADA  are  defined  as  ADA  that  developed  post-treatment  in  patients  with  negative 
ADA  screens  at  Baseline  (ie,  seroconversion  to  ADA  positivity  from  a  seronegative  state).  Across  both 
Phase  3  PsA  trials,  treatment-emergent  ADA  were  detected  in  one  patient  only  (1/996,  0.1%)  who  was 
receiving  75  mg  secukinumab  at  the  time  of  the  positive  result  at  Week  24.  A  subsequent  sample 
collected at Week 52 was negative for ADA. There was no loss of efficacy, no immunogenicity-related AEs 
and no altered PK profile in this single case of treatment-emergent ADA. 
Non-treatment  emergent  ADA  were  also  observed  in  both  Phase  3  PsA  trials.  A  total  of  16/996  (1.6%) 
patients were ADA positive at Baseline. This includes 10 patients who were ADA positive at Baseline only 
and  reverted  to  a  seronegative  state  while  on  secukinumab  treatment,  and  6  patients  who  had  both 
baseline  and  post-baseline  ADA  positive  samples.  Overall,  the  non-treatment  emergent  positive  ADA 
responses were mostly transient and of low titer. The MSD-based assay is highly sensitive and therefore 
capable  of  detecting  very  low  levels  of  antibodies  which  can  bind  to  secukinumab.  Consequently,  non-
treatment  related,  naturally  occurring  ADA  may  lead  to  a  confirmed  positive  response  in  this  assay  in 
either  predose  samples  or  samples  derived  from  patients  not  exposed  to  secukinumab.  These 
observations  were  not  considered  to  be  clinically  relevant,  as  the  ADA  were  not  associated  with 
secukinumab treatment. Of the 17 patients who tested positive for ADA at any time point in either Phase 
3  PsA  trials,  10  (58.8%)  reverted  to  a  seronegative  state  at  a  later  time  point  with  no  detectable  ADA 
while on secukinumab treatment. This total includes the single patient with treatment-emergent ADA who 
also reverted to a seronegative state while on treatment.  
ADA  were  also  not  associated  with  altered  PK  profiles.  Secukinumab  concentrations  in  all  patients  with 
ADA and more than one evaluable PK sample fit into the observed range for all patients without ADA at 
Weeks 4, 16, 24 and 52. There was also no correlation between ADA titers and alteration in PK profile in 
Phase 2 or 3 patients. 
Across  all  secukinumab-exposed  patients  evaluated  for  ADA  in  the  2  Phase  3  PsA  trials,  8/996  (0.8%) 
patients tested positive for both ADA and neutralizing antibodies. PK profiles were normal and therapeutic 
efficacy was maintained in these patients with neutralizing antibodies, although one of these patients  had 
only one PK sample available and another patient  had too few evaluable visits while on active treatment 
to  fully  assess  the  impact  on  efficacy.  The  patient  with  possible  loss  of  efficacy  had  no  neutralizing 
antibodies associated with the positive ADA. 
Drug interactions and other interactions 
Prior anti-TNF-alpha exposure 
The  exposure-adjusted  AE  profile  over  the  entire  treatment  period  by  prior  anti-TNF-α  exposure  was 
similar to that observed in the overall population of Pool A. The incidence per 100 patient-years of total 
AEs  and  of  the  most  frequently  occurring  SOCs  including  infections  and  infestations  showed  the  same 
pattern  as  seen  in  the  overall  population,  with  numerically  higher  rates  in  the  placebo  group  compared

with the Any secukinumab dose group. A dose dependency could be noted for infections and infestations 
as well as for gastrointestinal disorders, which appeared to be more pronounced and consistent in TNFa-
IR patients. 
Overall  the  incidence  of  exposure-adjusted  incidence  of  total  AEs  was  higher  in  TNFa-IR  patient  than  in 
anti-TNFα naïve patients in all treatment groups). 
The  exposure-adjusted  incidence  rate  of  total  SAEs  was  low  and  showed  no  trends  by  prior  anti-TNF-α 
exposure  (Table  30).  Among  the  TNFa-IR  patients,  serious  infections  were  more  frequent  with 
secukinumab  vs.  placebo (IR=2.9  for  Any  secukinumab  dose  vs.  0  for  placebo),  driven  by  a  higher  rate 
with  the  300  mg  dose  (7.2  for  Any  300  mg  vs.  2.4  for  Any  150  mg  and  2.5  for  Any  75  mg).  However, 
similar to the overall population, the rate was higher with placebo vs. secukinumab among the anti-TNF-α 
naïve  patients  (IR=4.1  for  placebo  vs.  2.4  for  Any  secukinumab  dose),  with  no  meaningful  dose  effect 
across  the  secukinumab  groups  (IR=3.3,  2.6  and  2.0  for  Any  300  mg,  Any  150  mg  and  Any  75  mg, 
respectively).

Concomitant methotrexate use 
There  were  no  additional  trends  in  total  AEs  or  in  the  most  frequently  affected  SOC  of  infections  and 
infestations  compared  to  the  overall  population.  No  clinically  meaningful  differences  were  seen  in  the 
incidence of AEs in any SOC across subgroups of concomitant use of methotrexate. 
Concomitant corticosteroid use 
Exposure-adjusted  incidence  rates  showed  similar  trends  for  total  AEs  and  for  the  most  frequently 
affected SOC of infections and infestations as compared to the overall population. No clinically meaningful

differences were seen in the incidence of safety risks based on SAEs between subgroups of concomitant 
use of corticosteroids 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  secukinumab  development  program  studied  7048  patients,  including  6200  patients  exposed  to  at 
least  one  dose of  secukinumab  in  any  indication,  and  6267  patient-years  of secukinumab  exposure,  are 
included  in  the  safety  pooling.  The  safety  data  in  the  present  submission  provided  an  additional  2679 
patient-years  of  secukinumab  exposure  (75%  increase),  including  955  patient-years  of  exposure  in  PsA 
patients,  beyond  the  3588  patient-years  of  exposure  reported  previously  for  the  psoriasis  development 
program. 
Pool A consisted of 2 pivotal placebo-controlled Phase 3 trials (F2306 and F2312) in PsA with placebo and 
dose  comparisons  that  allow  risks  to  be  evaluated  in  the  PsA  population  during  the  first  16  weeks  of 
treatment,  which  was  the  placebo-controlled  phase,  and  during  the  entire  treatment  period  (median  48 
weeks of exposure to secukinumab, interim analyses on week 52 in study F2306 and on week 24 in study 
F2312). 
Pool B1 (an expanded PsA population with PsA patients from the 2 Phase 3 PsA trials, F2306 and F2312, 
and psoriasis patients with concomitant PsA from 3 Phase 3 psoriasis trials, A2302, A2303, and A2304). 
Pool B (a mixed population of PsA patients from the 2 Phase 3 PsA trials, F2306 and F2312, and psoriasis 
patients  from  the  5  Phase  3  psoriasis  trials  A2302,  A2303,  A2304,  A2308,  and  A2309)  increased  the 
probability of observing less common events over long-term treatment for the target doses of 150 mg sc 
and 300 mg sc. 
Pool C, the largest data pool, included all patients treated with secukinumab in 42 studies and maximized 
the probability of observing rare events in patients receiving secukinumab. 
Deaths, overall AEs and SAEs were examined for Pools A, B1 and B. The severity of AEs, the relationship 
of  AEs  to  study  treatment,  AEs  causing  permanent  discontinuation  of  study  treatment,  laboratory 
parameters,  vital  signs,  and  electrocardiogram  (ECG)  data  were  examined  for  patients  in  PsA  and 
psoriasis studies (Pools A and B). Risk categories (AEs of special interests, corresponding to potential and 
identified  risks  in  the  RMP)  were  examined  for  Pools  A,  B1  and  B.  Pool  C  was  used  to  examine 
malignancies and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) only. 
Pooling was done in a rational manner to 1) investigate the specific safety concerns during the induction 
period  in  the  PsA  studies  (related  to  either  iv  or  sc  loading  regimen),  2)  to  enable  comparisons  against 
placebo during the initial 16 weeks of PsA studies, 3) to find out about long term tolerability in psoriasis 
and PsA indications, and 4) to investigate the overall critical safety features of secukinumab pooled from 
all  exposed  patients  (longest  follow-up  to  date  of  reporting  over  212  weeks  in  1  subject  and  over  132 
weeks in 108 subjects). 
The AE profile of induction and placebo controlled study phases resembles closely the AE profile observed 
in  the  initial  submission  of  psoriasis  indication,  where  up  to  week  12,  the  most  common  AEs:  were 
nasopharyngitis  (placebo  8.6%  vs.  secukinumab  11.9%),  headache  (5.2%  vs.  6.0%),  diarrhoea  (1.4% 
vs. 3.3%), pruritus (2.6% vs 3.2%), URTI (0.7% vs. 2.82%), oropharyngeal pain (1.7% vs. 2.3%), and 
arthralgia (2.4% vs. 2.1%). 
In PsA patients it appeared that nasopharyngitis was slightly more common in patients receiving the iv-
loading.  Oral  herpes  was  observed  more  in  patients  receiving  300  mg  sc-doses  (n=4)  or  iv-loading  and 
150 mg sc-doses (n=5).  However, none of the herpes cases were severe or led to discontinuation from 
the  study.  Eight  cases  of  rhinitis,  6  cases  of  conjunctivitis,  and  6  cases  of  mouth  ulcerations  were 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/665427/2015 
Page 74/84 
 
  
  
 
reported  from  patients  receiving  secukinumab,  but  not  from  patients  who  had  received  placebo.  Mouth 
ulcerations were not associated with candidiasis. These observations supported the use of the sc-loading 
method  and  use  of  lower  than  300  mg  sc  doses  in  maintenance,  when  possible,  to  ensure  the  greatest 
safety. 
Similarly  to  weeks  0  to  16,  in  the  entire  study  period  the  AE  profile  closely  resembled  that  seen  in  the 
psoriasis studies, where nasopharyngitis, URTIs, arthralgia, hypertension, diarrhoea, back pain, pruritus, 
cough, psoriasis, and oropharyngeal pain were the top ten preferred terms for AEs. 
There appeared to be no dose-dependence during maintenance treatment for most of the reported AEs. 
However,  a  trend  for  dose-dependence  can  be  observed  in  the  incidences  of  sinusitis  (2.7%,  3.4%, 
10.3% for 75 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg sc doses, vs. 5.7% in the placebo patients), oral herpes (1.7%, 
2.8%,  5.7%  for  75  mg,  150  mg,  and  300  mg  sc  doses,  vs.  3.8%  in  the  placebo  patients)  pharyngitis 
(2.4%,  3.0%,  5.6%  for  75  mg,  150  mg,  and  300  mg  sc  doses,  vs.  0.0%  in  the  placebo  patients),  and 
epistaxis  (0%,  0,2%,  3.3%  vs.  2.9%  respectively)  in  the  two  PsA  trials.  In  earlier  psoriasis  trials, 
headache was more common in patients receiving placebo, with no difference between 150 and 300 mg 
doses. Oral herpes affected 1.49% of patients receiving placebo, 1.50% of patients receiving 150 mg sc 
and 1.74% of patients receiving 300 mg sc. Therefore, escalation of the dose to 300 mg sc when needed 
in accordance with the PsA indication can be justified. 
Upper  respiratory  tract  infections,  candida  infections,  and  mainly  oral  herpes  infections  have  been 
addressed in sufficient manner in the current Cosentyx-PI. There are no new findings in this respect from 
the PsA-studies. No cases of tuberculosis or viral hepatitis were reported. 
Deaths  in  patients  receiving  secukinumab  were  all  associated  with  severe  cardiovascular  risks  and  co-
morbidity  and  do  not  seem  to  be  related  to  the  study  medications  in  the  PsA  studies.  The  same 
conclusion could be made about deaths in the AS studies. 
SAEs  in  Pool  A  first  16  weeks  consisted  of  two  occurrences  of  cerebrovascular  accident  in  10  mg/kg-75 
mg  sc  group,  and  two  occurrences  of  erysipelas  in  150  mg  sc  and  300  mg  sc  groups.  For  rest  of  the 
studies,  there  was  also  one  erysipelas  case  in  the  placebo  group.  Incidence  rates  of  erysipelas,  chest 
pain,  osteoarthritis,  sepsis,  coronary  artery  disease,  and  septic  shock  were  lower  during  secukinumab 
treatment  compared  to  placebo  treatment.  Atrial  fibrillation,  cerebrovascular  accident,  deep  vein 
thrombosis,  diverticulitis,  myocardial  infarction,  pneumonia,  psoriatic  arthropathy,  septic  shock,  and 
positional vertigo were reported two times each during secukinumab treatment and never during placebo 
treatment.  Most  of  these  cases  were  reported  from  the  75  mg  sc  patients,  thus  no  apparent  dose-
dependence could be observed. There were no significant findings in Pool B compared to pool A. 
Two  new  diagnoses of  Crohn’s  disease  were  made  during  or  after  secukinumab  exposure in  AS  patients 
and one new diagnosis similarly in PsA patients. Crohn´s disease has already been addressed in sufficient 
manner  in  the  product  information  of  secukinumab  and  no  further  action  was  considered  necessary  in 
relation to the psoriatic arthritis indication. 
Skin  malignancies  as  well  as  other  malignancies  were  rare,  and  not  considered  related  to  study 
medications in Pool A.  
Three  cases  of  lymphomas  in  psoriasis  and  ankylosing  spondylitis  studies  were  evaluated  closely.  While 
the  2  lymphoma  cases  observed  on  secukinumab  occurred  after  many  months  of  exposure  to  the  IMP, 
they  had  quite  different  characteristics  suggesting  a  different  underlying  etiopathogenesis.  Some 
commonalities  in  these  2  lymphoma  cases  would  have  been  expected  if  they  were  to  be  associated  to 
neutralisation of IL-17A. 
During  the  induction  period  in  Pool  B,  there  were  10  cardiac  disorders  reported  as  SAEs  in  the  “Any 
secukinumab dose” group, compared to none in the placebo- and etanercept-groups. Number of patients

experiencing  a  serious  cardiovascular  adverse  event  (and  the  incidence  rate  per  100  patient  years)  for 
placebo  0  (0.00),  secukinumab  150  mg  13  (1.14),  secukinumab  300  mg  7  (0.60),  and  etanercept  3 
(1.03) would suggest a slightly increased risk for users of secukinumab. However, taking into account the 
larger and - in particular - longer exposure to secukinumab and that most of the SAEs occurred weeks or 
months  after  continuous  secukinumab  use  in  patients  with  predisposing  factors  and  cardiovascular 
morbidity, there was no implication that secukinumab would predispose patients to serious cardiovascular 
complications.  The  same  conclusions  can  be  drawn  from  the  analyses  of  the  PsA  studies.  The  issue  will 
remain  under  close  review  as  it  is  included  in  the  RMP  as  an  important  potential  risk,  but  the  CHMP 
considered that no updates to the SmPC would be warranted at this stage based on the available data. 
There  was  a  significant  decrease  in  total  leukocytes  and  neutrophils  in  the  pooled  secukinumab  group 
during  all  pivotal  studies  in  the  psoriasis  submission.  This  decrease  was  considered  related  to  the 
pharmacodynamic  effects  of  the  drug  (and  it  was  somewhat  more  prominent  in  the  etanercept  group 
compared to secukinumab patients). In general, the neutropenia cases were not associated with SAEs or 
treatment discontinuation. There were no new findings in the PsA studies in this respect. There were no 
observed  effects  attributable  to  use  of  study  medications  in  haemoglobin,  lymphocyte,  and  platelet 
parameters. In the three cases of severe hepatobiliary AEs, there was concomitant morbidity at baseline 
or concomitant medications in use. 
Mild  elevations  of  ALT  observed  during  induction  period,  with  only  slight  differences  between  different 
induction regimens, appear not to be a relevant safety issue. 
The  mild  elevations  grade  I  elevation  of  total  cholesterol  and  triglycerides  appear  in  similar  incidences 
irrespective of route of loading doses and clinically insignificant as well. Grade II elevations of cholesterol 
were observed in 2/293 (0.68%) in patients receiving sc loading and 9/390 (2.31%) in patients receiving 
iv  loading  (during  the  first  16  weeks). However,  as  iv  loading  is  not  foreseen  in  the  clinical  setting,  the 
higher incidence in those patients is not considered a significant finding. 
There  were  no  clinically  meaningful  differences  in  the  AE  profile  stratified  by  the  baseline  BSA  (<10%, 
>10%), body weight (<90 kg, >90 kg), and gender. 
AE  profiles  of  patients  having  earlier  taken  biologicals  and/or  currently  taking  immunosuppressants 
appeared  similar.  Concomitant  immunosuppression  should  warrant  more  careful  follow  up  of the  patient 
regarding severe infections and adequate warnings are contained in the SmPC. All immune reactions were 
non-serious.  One  case  of  angioedema  was  related  to  study  medication  and  resolved  in  13  days  after 
discontinuation  of  study.  One  case  of  anaphylaxis  was  considered  related  to  a  concomitant  antibiotic 
treatment. 
Milder  forms  of  hypersensitivity  reactions  were  rare.  Urticaria  was  seen  here  less  frequently  (0.5%) 
compared  to  the  original  psoriasis  submission  (1.85%).  Rash  was  slightly  less  common  here  (2.2%) 
compared to the earlier submission (2.45%). Overall incidence of hypersensitivity reaction in here Pool A 
was 9.2% and 11.17% in the original submission in the secukinumab patients. 
The  presence  of  anti-secukinumab  antibodies  was  scarce,  suggesting  that  the  potential  risk  of 
immunogenicity  is  low.  Based  on  the  clinical  trial  data,  the  immunogenicity  to  secukinumab  did  not 
appear to have a negative impact on the overall safety profile, efficacy, or pharmacokinetic parameters of 
secukinumab.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The  safety  profile of  secukinumab  in  treatment  of  PsA  in  both  the  induction  and  maintenance  phases  of 
the  studies  resembled  closely  to  the  safety  profile  observed  in  the  psoriasis  indication  of  the  initial 
submission.  ADRs  occurring  more  frequently  in  the  secukinumab  group  included  URTI,  nasopharyngitis,

sinusitis, and diarrhoea. There were no new findings regarding Crohn´s disease or MACEs. There were no 
new  concerns  about  malignancies.  Hypersensitivity  and  immunological  reactions  remain  rare  and 
immunogenic potential of secukinumab appeared very low, with no clinical implications. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. The PSUR cycle for the medicinal product should follow a half-yearly 
cycle until otherwise agreed by the CHMP. 
The next data lock point will be 25 December 2015. 
The annex II related to the PSUR refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 2.1 is acceptable. The PRAC endorsed PRAC 
Rapporteur assessment report is attached.

The MAH proposed to update the RMP to change the due date of the Psoriasis registry (category 3 study). 
The  revision  in  the  final  report  date  of  the  Psoriasis  Registry  resulted  in  an  increase  in  the  sample  size 
from  2000  to  3000  secukinumab  treated  subjects  and  in  the  follow-up  period  from  5  to  8  years.  These 
changes required a revision in the study duration and final report date which is now at Q2 2030.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Rapid and clinically meaningful efficacy of secukinumab in the treatment of PsA has been demonstrated. 
Both  phase  III  studies  met  the  primary  endpoint  of  ACR20  response  rates  at  Week  24.  The  response 
rates in Study F2306 were 50.5% for secukinumab 10 mg/kg-75 mg, 50.0% for 10 mg/kg-150 mg and 
17.3% for placebo (p<0.0001 for each comparison vs. placebo). The response rates in Study F2312 were 
29.3%  for  secukinumab  75  mg,  51.0%  for  secukinumab  150  mg,  54.0  for  secukinumab  300  mg  and 
15.3%  for  placebo  (p<0.0001  for  secukinumab  150  mg  and  300  mg  vs.  placebo,  p=0.0200  for 
secukinumab 75 mg vs. placebo). The efficacy was also maintained up to Week 52. 
Results of the secondary efficacy endpoints were in general consistent with those of the primary efficacy 
endpoint.  Secondary  efficacy  endpoints  related  to  signs  and  symptoms  of  PsA,  such  as  DAS28-CRP 
change,  ACR50  response,  SF-36  PCS,  HAQ-DI,    and  the  presence of  dactylitis  and  enthesitis,  as  well  as 
those  related to  concomitant  psoriasis  such  as  PASI75  and  PASI90  were  generally  met  for  secukinumab 
doses  150  mg  and  300  mg.  As  an  exception,  HAQ-DI  response  at  Week  24  was  not  statistically 
significantly different to placebo in Study F2312 in the secukinumab 150 mg dose group.  
Overall,  efficacy  endpoints  related  to  joint  and  skin  disease,  physical  function,  health-related  quality  of 
life consistently showed robust and clinically relevant efficacy of secukinumab in the treatment of PsA. 
In Study F2306, statistically significant inhibition of progression of structural damage based on the vdH-
mTSS  at  Week  24  was  shown  for  both  secukinumab  doses.  The  lower  dose  of  10  mg/kg-75  mg 
demonstrated  somewhat  better  efficacy  vs.  placebo  compared  to  the  higher  dose  of  10  mg/kg-150  mg 
(p-values 0.0132 and 0.0212, respectively).  
The pivotal studies were stratified according to previous use of TNFα inhibitors. Based on results of Study 
F2312, in TNFα-IR patients at Week 24, ACR 20 response rates in the secukinumab 75 mg, 150 mg and 
300 mg dose groups were 14.7%, 29.7% and 45.5%, respectively, compared with 14.3% in the placebo 
group.  The  difference  vs.  placebo  was  statistically  significant  for  the  300  mg  dose  level  (p=0.0077). 
Higher  PASI75  and  PASI90  rates  were  also  observed  with  secukinumab  300  mg  dose  compared  to  the 
150 mg dose, consistent with the phase III psoriasis program. Week 52 efficacy data was consistent with 
the results obtained at Week 24. Therefore, the recommended dose is 150 mg sc, while the 300 mg dose 
is  more  appropriate  for  TNFα-IR  patients  and  for  patients  with  concomitant  moderate  to  severe  plaque 
psoriasis. No dose adjustment based on body weight is needed. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The data in Study F2306 was generated with an iv secukinumab loading regimen that resulted in greater 
initial exposure.  The role of induction regimen appears however limited in the prevention of progression 
of  structural  damage.  Nevertheless,  Section  5.1  of  the  SmPC  includes  a  statement  that  the  inhibition  of 
progression of structural damage in PsA has not yet been demonstrated using the subcutaneous loading 
regimen which is approved for clinical use. 
Neither  of  the  pivotal  studies  in  PsA  had  an  active  control  arm.  The  lack  of  active  control  is  partly 
compensated by the etanercept-controlled psoriasis Study A2303 with a subset of PsA patients, as well as 
by the responses reported for other biologics studied in similar clinical study settings. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/665427/2015 
Page 80/84 
 
  
  
 
 
There  is  also  a  lack  of  dedicated  assessment  of  axial  inflammation,  as  recommended  in  the  EMA  PsA 
guideline. Considering the overall weight of evidence on the efficacy of secukinumab in both PsA and AS, 
extrapolation of the clinical benefit in axial involvement in AS to PsA is however considered meaningful. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Infections  were  more  commonly  reported  in  secukinumab-treated  patients  compared  to  placebo.  The 
imbalance  with  secukinumab  vs.  placebo  was  mainly  due  to  upper  respiratory  tract  infections.  Also 
candida  infections  and  oral  herpes  infections  were  more  commonly  reported  compared  to  placebo. 
Infections are included in the RMP as an important identified risk with appropriate warnings also included 
in the SmPC. 
The  increased  incidence  of  candida  infections  was  mainly  due  to  oral  candidiasis  and  vulvovaginal 
candidiasis  and  consistent  with  the  mechanism  of  action  of  secukinumab  and  knowledge  on  the  IL-17 
biology.  All  candida  infections  were  mild  to  moderate  in  severity  and  none  led  to  treatment 
discontinuation. 
Neutropenia  was  more  common  in  secukinumab-treated  patients  compare  to  placebo.  In  general,  the 
neutropenia  cases  were  not  associated  with  SAEs  or  discontinuations.  Majority  of  the  neutropenia  cases 
were  associated  with  iv  loading  regimen,  which  will  not  be  used  in  the  clinical  practice.  Neutropenia  is 
included in the RMP as an important identified risk with appropriate warnings in the SmPC.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Statistically  significant  efficacy  of  secukinumab  in  the  treatment  of  PsA  has  been  shown  with  respect  to 
joint  and  skin  disease,  physical  function,  health-related  quality  of  life  and  prevention  of  progression  of 
structural damage. These results are considered robust and clinically relevant.  
Secukinumab provides a novel treatment option for PsA, including the hard-to-treat patients, i.e., TNFα- 
IR population. 
 The  most  relevant  safety  concerns  of  secukinumab  identified  so  far  are  related  to  mild  infections. 
Appropriate measures to minimise this risk are included in the SmPC and further information on this issue 
will be collected as described in the RMP. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Efficacy of secukinumab in the treatment of PsA has been demonstrated. The safety profile is favourable 
based on the data currently available.

Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
Clinically  relevant  efficacy  has  been  shown  for  secukinumab  in  the  treatment  of  PsA.  These  results  are 
considered  robust.  The  overall  safety  profile  of  secukinumab  appears  favourable.  Unfavourable  effects 
typical  for  biologic  therapies  have  been  observed,  including  infections  and  mild  neutropenia,  but  no 
increase was observed in the rate of mycobacterial or serious opportunistic infections. 
Based on the data available, secukinumab alone or in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is approvable 
for  the  treatment  of  active  psoriatic  arthritis  in  adult  patients  when  the  response  to  previous  disease 
modifying anti rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy has been inadequate is approvable.
